- She's already 15 minutes late. - Let's hope she comes! She will! Cerasella won't let a husband like Alfredo get away. I feel sorry for the groom. Look at his face! Auntie, hold still. Now he'll have to put up with her. Her brother is happy to get rid of her. Calm down, Alfredo. - She's coming. - We've been waiting 20 minutes! I've waited 2 years to marry him because his sister must marry first. At least you're waiting at home and not in front of a church! - Here she is. She's coming! - Who? Oh! Cheers for the newlyweds. 25 minutes late. "She arrived late at her wedding" "showing inadequate respect to a bride's uniform." Am I in punishment? Stupid! Auntie, where are you? Let's keep together. - What are you doing? - Don't have anyone notice. Go on. - Are you crazy? - They're hurting me. Cerasella, you're embarrassing me. Put your shoes back on! What? I gave you my hand, but my feet are still mine! - What do feet have to do with it? - They don't fit in the shoes! - I knew it'd end up this way! - What a scandal! Cerasella, for the love of God, put your shoes back on. At least one! - Put them on, or I'll slap you! - Don't you dare! No! No! Cerasella, do it for me. What kind of man are you? You want to be ridiculed? - Cerase... Cerasella, obey! - Who? You? Am I your slave? If you care so much, marry the shoes! Auntie! What a scandal! Excuse me, hold her a moment. Excuse me, I'm the groom! Cerasella, stop! Your shoes! Come back, Cerasella! - What is she doing? Who is she? - Must be a latecomer. - I caught you! - Mom! - Be quiet. Hold still. - Mom! My child, what did they do to you? - What did you do to my little girl? - Me? Nothing, Marshal. I was looking for my sister. - Brutes like you should be shot! - No... - Silence! - Yes, sir! At attention! I'll make out a report to your command. Be thankful that I don't have you arrested on the spot! - What is your name? - Me? Giuseppe. Soldier... Marzano Giuseppe. I'll teach you to molest little girls! Let's go. Look at that scoundrel! Yes, sir! Don't frighten me! - Did you find her? - No. She ran to Uncle Salvatore, I'm sure. I'll take care of her! Let's run! Watch out! You'll slip! - By this time, they're married. - Who knows! You can't ever be sure of anything with Cerasella. Alfredo is a good match, a nice young man. He is a grocer. With women, it's not enough to be nice, and a grocer! Then why is she marrying him? I asked myself that, too. I raised her like a daughter. It seems like yesterday when I took her in my home, when I found her with her brother among the ruins after the first bombings in 1943. Without any parents, relatives or anyone left. You have a big heart, Uncle Salvatore! No! Cerasella was a blessing for me. She made me happy when I was still able to work, down there in my beach club. Time flies! My God! You think something happened to Cerasella? I don't see her! No! Nothing ever happens to Cerasella. She's always the one to make something happen. - Where is Cerasella? - Who knows. She ran away, understand? - Why did you let her get away? - Me? Jesus! Now it's my fault? Uncle Salvatore, be truthful. Where is she hiding? You know. You always protect her. Protect her? From who? I don't know a thing. Alright. We'll look elsewhere. Let's hurry! - Put that stuff down. - Here. - They can still be useful. - Let's run! I could feel it! I'd told her brother, Giuseppe. Cerasella isn't mature enough for Alfredo. But he stubbornly said, "If Cerasella isn't settled, I can't marry." And Cerasella settled everything. Here's Pasqualino. Pasqualino! - What manners! - Pasqualino, did you see my sister? - Did you see her? - How can I remember everyone? You've known my sister since you were born! I've known lots of people since I was born - Do you know this? - Very little! - It's yours, if you talk. - I saw her running. - Where? - This way, that way! - This way, that way! - Where was she running? - Like this. - Idiot! I'll get a boat and follow her by sea. You, by land. I'll run via the sea... No, by land. - Where are you going? - She was running that way. Because of her you haven't said a nice word to me for months. You don't even notice I exist! You're right. I'm sorry. Please, I apologize. Will you forgive me? You're right, but she's my sister, and until... Until you settle her, you can't think of me! That's right. I have to run look for her now. I'll find her and we'll marry right away. Bye! I got you! I'll fix you up now! Who are you? What do you want? Who are you looking for? Excuse me. I was looking for a bride. Really? Then make yourself comfortable. It is a strange way of looking for a bride. I wasn't looking for a bride for myself. I was looking... for another bride. You're looking for someone who will teach you manners! - Yes! - Go away! Go away! Don't touch my daughter! - Excuse me. - First he searches and then... My new hat! Cerasella, finally! Darling, my love... How dare you? I am engineer Cabiraghi from Sestri Levante! Cerasella to me? Excuse me, sir. Engineer! Enough of that music! You, down there. Stop shooting. Stop the fireworks! Mr. Alfredo, excuse me. - I didn't know. - We didn't either! Start sitting down. The bride is coming. Women like for men to wait for them. Please, sit down What are you saying? She didn't even come to church! Let's speak clearly. If you don't eat, too bad for you. You'll pay the bill anyway. He's right. There was a banquet invitation. No arguing about that! - Keep calm! - It was the last of the fireworks. Excuse me, Mrs. Rosina. We'll follow your orders. People, get moving. Don't just stand there. Hurry! Don't think about it. So much the better. - What are you saying? - What can we play? - Nothing. - What? Let me take care of it. Listen. - Will you give me the guitar? - Please. "You Were Born Lucky". Marriage is simple, even if it isn't easy. When the bride is young, there is no danger. - Is he referring to you? - He's a friend. He's kidding. Cheer up! Then she makes you die. You were born lucky. You are a fortunate man. If the bride left you, go thank her. Don't waste time, with this downcast air... It's your fault. You're too much in love and you're too kind. You'll see tonight! Tonight? - I have to be at the station! - You're leaving me now? I am not a free citizen. I wear a uniform! I'm lucky they gave me a permit today! At least try! Explain the case, and insist. I could call the officer on duty. I'll try. I'll try. Marriage is simple, even if it isn't easy. When the bride is young, there is no danger. With so many women happy to get married, why do you waste time with her? Hello? The officer on duty? Lieutenant, excuse me if I disturb you. But it is something very important. An exceptional case. Who am I? Soldier Giuseppe Marzano. Good. I was looking just for you! There is a report on you. Come right back to the station! Yes, sir! - Alright. - Everything alright? Everything is terrible! You were born lucky. You're a fortunate man. If the bride leaves you, go thank her. Go thank her! I came to Italy set on meeting many women. Instead, I saw you... and now I am only thinking of marrying. It's the only thing I'm thinking of, too. I can just see the church full of people. My father and your mother crying, your hand in mine, and the priest saying... "Do you want, as your legitimate spouse..." - Who are you? - What are you doing here? Me? Nothing. I came on the boat a moment and... This is a private boat, not a waterbus. I know, but what happened to me... How are you dressed? As a bride? Yes. That is why I... As happens in photo-novels. Dumped on her wedding day. Nobody ever dumped me! In that case, we can start doing so now! No need. I'm leaving by myself! What are you doing? Madam! Come back! The shore is far away! Madam! Miss! Let her go, Bruno. Don't waste time with her. I can't. She can't manage to swim back to shore. Follow us. I'll bring her back on board. I don't know how to maneuver the sail! Come back! Pull the sail towards you. Understand? Help! Help! Come on, hang on to me. - I drank. - Hang on me. - Where are you going? - I'm busy. Wait for me here! - How do you feel? - Better. It's all your fault! I was minding my own business. Then you came, and messed everything up. I'm sorry, but I didn't do it on purpose. Then why did you get on my boat dressed like this? - I was to get married. - What? But I had second thoughts a few minutes before. You're amazing. You have second thoughts a few minutes before! Better a few minutes before than a few minutes after. - First give me 200 liras. - You don't trust him? Alright. Here's 200 liras! You sister is on the shore embracing a man. - What? Where? - Down at the beach club. My God! Let's run! - Excuse me. Where did they go? - I don't know. - Alright. How much? - 200 liras. - When is the speedboat coming? - Soon. Why are you so worried? She doesn't know how to use sails. - Is she your fianc√©e? - Yes. - Will you marry her? - Of course! I won't do as you did, and have second thoughts! - When I decide something... - But if you regret it, it's too late. I won't regret it! She loves me and I love her. What've you got to do with it? Mind your own business! - Excuse me. - Here comes the speedboat! Goodbye and thanks for saving me. Hey, Nora! I'm here! Wait for me! Now you'll settle accounts with me! Where were you? What did you do? Speak up! Speak up! Hold still! What happened to you? - Nothing. - You miserable woman! Do you realize what you did? People are laughing at us. - Alfredo is desperate, and you... - And I don't care! Right, because you're thoughtless! Who is that young man? Was he with you? I'm talking to you! You can tell us. Are you in love with someone else? Pasqualino! I'll take care of her. I am her husband. - What husband? - Almost. - You can tell me the truth. - No. She must only tell me! - Finally! What did you do? - I'll leave you alone. - Thank you. - Come on. Let's leave them alone. - Alfredo, forgive me. - Of course I'll forgive you, but... I don't know what happened to me. As long as you're back. I just want to know one thing. - Do you still love me? - I think so. How do I know? - They say you were embracing a man. - Of course not! - I never deceived anyone. - I know. That is why I love you. - So we'll get married? - Alright. I'll buy you a pair of big, large and comfortable shoes. - Can we get married tomorrow? - No. - Don't rush me. - Why? - Marriage frightens me. - You don't love me? Yes, I do a bit, but... - Let me think it over more. - Yes, do that! I'll think close to you. Let's think together. Hey, you! Hey, you! I'm Cerasella's brother. - Cerasella? Who is she? - What? In front of the lady it's not convenient to remember her. - Who is she? - I don't know her. You don't know her, huh? They saw you with her! You must leave my sister alone. Understand? Because of you, she didn't get married this morning! Just a moment! Do you mean a girl dressed as a bride? - In fact! - It's absurd! I saw her today for the first time, and hope it's the last! All we needed was you! Oh, come on! Esteemed military man, the gentleman is my fianc√© and he's not the type to look for Cerasellas or stuff like that. Go! - Miss... - Go away! Will you give me some information? Here. It's about that young man. Yes, his name is Bruno. He lives with a blond in that villa. Is he young and rich? How long has he been here? For 200 liras how much do you want to know? I told you where he is. Now it's up to you! Speculator! After an excellent Italian lunch, a good Neapolitan coffee. - That comes from Brazil like you. - Thank you for this attention. All coffee comes from Brazil! Then let's say Brazilian coffee made Neapolitan style! Excuse me. I'm dying of the heat. - Bruno, accompany me in the garden. - Certainly! Such dears! Shall we talk about our youngsters? I think the moment has come for that. I think it's too early for Bruno. It's never too early for love. Alright. Grant me a truce at least. I already stated what my idea would be. Bruno will return to Brazil with me to train in my company. One day he will take my place. We'll come back here next year on vacation. - In the town where I was born. - A year waiting? It's an eternity for lovers! Who are you? What do you want? Excuse me. You don't know me. I am Cerasella's fianc√©. - Cerasella again! - Cerasella and I love each other. - Why come and tell me? - Yes, you! You, who took her away. Give her back to me, please. - Then it's true! - No! He is crazy! I have nothing to do with this Cerasella! Alright. Don't get angry. I'm not upset with you. You see... Cerasella is a somewhat strange girl. She changes her mind every day. Listen to me. Don't think of her anymore. - Here. - What is it? Sausages. I made them. They smell good. Smell how fresh! Smell them! You leave Cerasella alone and I... will give you the sausages. The offer is advantageous! Listen... Enough! Leave me alone. I don't want to hear anything about Cerasella again! Alright. Don't get angry. Yes, I am. I don't care about Cerasella. You can keep her! - Really? - And the sausages too. You've made me happy. You're so handsome. - Forget it, and go away. - Thank you too, miss. - You must accept or I'll be offended. - No, please. - Take the sausages back. - I'll give them to the lady. Why do you want to offend me? Tomorrow I'll bring two provolone cheeses and two salamis. Promise. If you'd thought of it before, none of this would've happened. You should have known if you were in love with Alfredo or not. How can you know if you're really in love? That's a problem that each person must solve by himself. Whoever is in love realizes it sooner or later. How? When they speak, when they kiss... Uncle Salvatore, with Alfredo I never noticed anything! - Are you sure? - Yes. I never wanted him to kiss me. It bothered me! Hello, Uncle Salvatore. You, stop! Listen to me carefully. I went to Alfredo's home and talked to Aunt Rosina. It's been decided. The wedding will take place during the week. - It's not possible. - Why not? I have to kiss Alfredo first. - I have to do a test. - What test? - Nothing. - What do you mean? Anyway, accompany me to the station now. Explain everything to the captain or they won't give me a permit. - What've I got to do with him? - You do, you do! You have to testify that I told the whole truth. And you must tell about all the trouble you caused. - I'm not coming. - You are coming! - Don't raise your voice, or... - My God, help! Uncle Salvatore! You take advantage because I'm in uniform and can't react. Obey your brother. And then do what you want. Go on! - Alright. Let's go to the captain. - Let's go. Don't run! I'd like to know why he didn't receive me too. I can't keep on giving your brother leaves of absence for a wedding that seems so uncertain. If it's postponed again, must I sign another one? You're right, Captain. I told my brother. "If the captain finds out the trick..." In fact! The trick? What trick? - Did I say trick? - Yes, you said it! I heard. So you're confessing that this wedding was a trick to have me give a permit? Yes, but he thought you'd understand and forgive him. - Right! - I told him so many times! "Do you think the captain is stupid?" And he answered, "Yes, he is!" - But don't punish him. - Is that what he said? Yes, but forgive him. He is a good young man - and respects you very much. - Oh, sure! He said, "Butter up the old fogey and he'll give me permission!" - He called me "old fogey"? - Yes. "Old fogey" or "monkey". Don't punish him. I ask you on my knees. What are you doing, miss? Get up! He is so kind, and I'm very fond of him. Even if sometimes he forces me with these fake weddings. Don't worry, miss. Your brother won't bother you for a long time. Thank you, Captain. But don't punish him! Soldier Marzano! My Alfredo... If there's no love, what can you do? She told me so often that she loved me. One day. But what about the next day? True. She never told me that two days in a row. - What should I do? - Have her fall in love at least - a week. - How can I? I, who am 100 years old, should tell you? - What happened? - It's Cerasella. - Hi, Uncle Salvatore. - Hey, little one! - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I came to ask to be forgiven. - To me? Yes. When you said there was no one in your life, I didn't believe it. They had said you were seen with a guy named Bruno. I had a man to man talk with him. He said he doesn't care about you. That young man on the boat? I don't know. When I saw him he was kissing a girl in a park. - And what a kiss! - He never tires! He's been kissing her since this morning! By the way, do you know how one can tell if he's in love? - No. How? - He kisses. Kiss me. - Now? - Now. - Here? - Here. May I? - If she tells you... - She told me! Uncle Salvatore, I don't feel anything here! Cerasella, that's not how you do it. You must find the right moment, the place, the right words. Uncle Salvatore is right. You can't just kiss like that. Of course not. I am embarrassed in front of him. Cerasella, after we're married we'll be perfect lovers. I want to marry you. Let's marry! Do you want to marry me? Yes! As soon as my brother gets his leave of absence. Do as I say. Come back home and in a couple of months you won't even remember the color of Nora's hair. You'll find a good, simple girl who is disinterested. - Impossible! - Like mother, like daughter. - They aim at your money. - It's not true! - It's true! - I won't allow you to insult them! You don't allow me what? Let's make things clear. I said "your money" thinking you could still reason. But since you are a total imbecile, then I'll explain things more in detail. The money is mine! I earned it with hard work, - and defend it with all my might! - As usual! - You only think of money. - Yes, only of money. Since you disdain my money so much, I'll show you what it's worth right away. - You want to marry Nora? - Yes. Fine! - Marry her. - Of course! I'll show you that Nora isn't as you think she is. She loves clothes, the good life, luxury, as all girls. But she could do without them because she loves me. Then I won't give you any more money. - What? - And I won't support you anymore. It doesn't matter. Nora is disinterested. I'll take this luggage away because I bought it. You can't do that. It's blackmail. It's not worse than yours. You want to blackmail me with my love as a father. Enough. The plane is leaving in two hours and I must go. I've no time to waste. If you want to come with me, you're still in time. - I have your ticket. - Thank you. I have no use for it. Take everything away. I'll show you that I can make it on my own. Great! As you wish. Goodbye. This morning at the lottery, lots of people were betting 36 and 63. 36 is wedding, and 63 is a bride who runs away. Wedding, bride... Darn it! Don't people think of anything else? The papers are filled with tragedies that happen to those who marry. - Husbands who kill their wives... - Cerasella, say what you want, - but I like marriage! - Get married! You must get married first. You know how your brother feels. - Look for someone else! - But I love him! How do you know that you love him? What a stupid question! Remember, I will marry your brother. Calm down! I told you. As soon as Giuseppe gets a permit. Here's Alfredo! I'm going to take a look at the beach. Cerasella, wait! Your brother got 30 days in a prison cell. Did you do it? - Me? Am I the commander? - What did he do? Be truthful. He didn't do anything, but she talked to the captain. Then four soldiers took Giuseppe and put him in prison. - Goodbye wedding! - You'll pay for this! It won't end here. I'll go to the Carabinieri captain. - I'll tell him everything. - Tell him I love someone else and that I won't marry you. I want to see what he says! - Someone else? Since when? - Since I saw him! - Don't believe her. It's another lie. - Really? Alright, it's a lie. But it has two legs, two arms, a chest and big muscles that can bust everyone's heads! No, your brother will bust your head because I'm going to the captain, the colonel, the minister, and have Giuseppe get out tomorrow! - Let's go, Alfredo. - What if there's other one? - He isn't. Come on. - Is there other man, Cerasella? Shall we add some fat? No, thin like you. What is this novelty? You always said you don't like me because I'm skin and bones! Weren't you supposed to marry Alfredo? Yes, but there's still time. Meanwhile, I need another boyfriend for a month or two. - And you chose me? - Yes. For a month or two. Feel like it? It's something we can discuss. What will you give me in exchange? - What do you want? - Nothing! For me it's enough that we pretend... - it's a real engagement. Come. - Let me go! Let me go! What's gotten into you? I told you. Nothing! Let me go! Let me go! - Come on. Hold still! - Take this! Are you crazy? No, please! Leave it. The tripe is mine! - Why did you throw it at me? - She did it! Scoundrel! Don't you ever try that again! - You always take it out on me! - Good morning! - A really good morning, thank you! - I'm sorry. Certain scoundrels must be taught manners! - What else happened? - Nothing. Each has his problems. - You can't understand me. - When it comes to problems, - no one can understand more than me. - You? Oh, come on! - Who has money always solves things. - The problem is having it! - Forget it. Goodbye. - Wait. - I don't believe you have no money. - Then don't. You seemed like a real gentleman yesterday and your only worry seemed to kiss that lady... And today I must find a job. What can I do? It's life. - Goodbye. I'm in a hurry. - Wait. - What is it now? - You're really looking for a job? Yes! Seriously! I am left with only what I have on. - What can you do? - Everything. I mean... nothing. But I'll get by. Would you be a lifeguard at my beach club? I was thinking of something better actually. - A lifeguard, so to say. - What do you mean? You can continue doing what you want. Even looking for a better paid job. I'll have you live the life of a gentleman! Excuse me. What sort of lifeguard are you looking for? The lifeguard is an excuse. I want to postpone my wedding. Understand? For a month or two we'd have to pretend to be in love and engaged. - You are crazy! - What are you afraid of? I don't eat my fianc√©s! We'll do each other a favor. Don't be silly! Goodbye. In fact, good riddance! Bruno, you're a nice man, but I have responsibilities with my daughter. So we'd better speak clearly. What are your intentions? Marrying Nora and finding a job. - What job? - Whatever I find. No, Bruno. On that condition, I say your father is right. Just a moment. What does Nora say? I've a right to know. Sure! You'll know what my daughter thinks right away. Come a moment, please. Bruno and I had a useful exchange of ideas. In concluding, I told him that you take your word back and consider yourself free from any commitment. That is what I've decided for your own good. If you have anything against it, speak freely. Don't be afraid. Say what you think as I did with my father. Don't worry about the consequences. I'm here. But I need your trust, your love. Well... I say that... Mom is right. Bruno, I know it's unpleasant to say this, but let's be practical. When money is lacking, love always ends up badly. What do you mean? You! You speak like that? Then you didn't love me. You only cared about my father's money! Please, don't be vulgar! - And calm down. - Calm down? You're telling me to be calm? I went against my family, I broke relations with my father, and you, in agreement with your mother, send me away! No, dear. We're not sending you away! Right, and for a simple reason. I'm leaving on my own! I'll show all of you what I am capable of. By myself! - Not much. I'm not very hungry. - No, come on! Your appetite will grow as you eat this. - You'll get a big appetite! - I already ate. - Two sandwiches. - This beats sandwiches. Hot and delicious! - Not much, please! - Oh, come on! - Enough. - No, more. - Enough! - Come on! Hey! What's wrong? There's a man dying here! - Hurry! - Who is he? My gosh. He is... - He's dead. - No. Go get some vinegar. What's wrong? Are you hungry? I had come... I wanted to ask you... Is that job as lifeguard still available? Yes, of course! Please, help me. Captain, I assure you that Giuseppe is innocent. You must not believe Cerasella. - She's crazy! - You want to marry a lunatic? - A lunatic... - Hey! What are you doing? - Hold still! - I like Cerasella, Marshal. - No, General. - Captain! Let's hope that with marriage she'll settle down. You should be the one to have her settle down. I'm trying. - If the wedding is cancelled again? - My gosh! What are you doing? Hold still! If the wedding is cancelled again, what should I do? No. This time I'll take care of it. You can trust me. - I'm more interested that anyone. - Why? Because Giuseppe will marry me. And we'll start with leaves of absences again. No! No! - He'll marry me after his service. - What is it? - Captain, soldier Marzano. - Oh! Let him in. Peppino! My love, what did they do to you? What are you doing? You're crazy! Stop! - Excuse me, Captain. - Come forward. Your cheek. The other one! The kiss! - Thank you, Captain! - What are you doing? The lady smeared lipstick on your cheek. Clean it! It happens. Excuse me. I'll do it. So, the lady explained everything to me. Your sister is a mythomaniac. - What? - A lunatic. - Yes, sir! - The punishment has been revoked. But this is the last time! Don't doubt it, Captain. You know that we're having battalion maneuvers. I can't give out many permits, but... considering the emergency situation, I'll give you a three hour permit. Remember, I want the precise date of the wedding. - Yes, sir! - You can go. Thank you. Just a moment. Marzano! But if your sister doesn't get married, I'll throw you in jail again. Understand? - Yes, sir! - Go on! Do you feel better now? Marvelously better. Listen. I want to earn this meal. - I will work, I'll do anything. - Sure, as we had agreed. Yes, but... - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Go then. I wanted to say... Can't we avoid the fake engagement thing? Are you afraid of the blond lady? No! It's over with her. Really? And so? I know! You're ashamed to be considered my fianc√©! What are you saying? You are a beautiful girl. Simple, pleasant, generous. Any man would be happy to be your fianc√©. So you accept? Yes or no? Miss... I want to be sincere with you. - I'm already in trouble. - I'm in worse trouble. - What are you doing here? - I... was eating. - Peppino, don't make a scene! - Be quiet! We'll settle accounts later. What are you doing with my sister? - Love! - I knew it! Yes. The gentleman... I mean, Bruno... He is the other man. I told you there was another man. They didn't believe it, but it's true! - Right? - I'd like to explain that... You said you didn't care about Cerasella. Now he cares! You care, don't you? How long has this been going on? What are your intentions? She is my sister! - Calm down! - What've you got to do with it? - As my sister, you depend on me. - No, on Uncle Salvatore! He decides. I told him everything and he agrees with me. - Uncle Salvatore? I don't believe it. - Ask him. - I will. - No, wait! Let's go advise him. He doesn't know anything. Stop! This is a swindle! Stop! - Uncle Salvatore, help me! - Who is he? - Be quiet! I will speak first. - No! I will! - No, me! - Calm down. What is going on? Uncle Salvatore, is it true that I told you everything? - About what? - That she is engaged to him. - Excuse me... - Be quiet! Yes, I'd told you. Remember carefully. You even said, "If you don't like Alfredo, forget about him". - You said that? - Me? - Take care! - No, Alfredo! - Tell him it's true! - What? Uncle Salvatore, speak up. Is it true or not? Yes, it's true. - Lifeguard! Lifeguard! - Yes, I'm coming. - Will you open my cabin? - Yes. I'll be right there. - Lifeguard! - Yes, here I am. Lifeguard, will you open my umbrella? Just a moment. I'll be right there. - Lifeguard, my dry bathrobe. - I'm coming! - Lifeguard, will you give us a boat? - Yes, I'll be right there! - Help! - What is it? Someone is drowning! - Help! - Is it Maria? Let's go see. - Lifeguard! - Let's go see. - Look at her! - She's doing it on purpose. Finally! She said it this morning. She'd kiss him, if she had to drown. Thank you! I will never forget that you saved my life. He fell for it! Come here! - Get undressed. - Why? - Take that t-shirt off. - Just a moment! Do you think I'm a puppet? "Do this, do that..." If we're to get along, calm down and don't speak in that tone. - And you respect our agreement. - It's what I'm doing. I never stopped a moment since this morning. - If I knew it'd be so tough... - You wouldn't have accepted? It's your fault. Don't bother with the girls and respect our pact. - The fake engagement? - Right! I can't do two things at a time. A fianc√© or a lifeguard. Choose. A fianc√©. - What are you doing? - Give me the t-shirt - with written "fianc√©". - Don't be funny! And you don't be overbearing! I'll continue being a lifeguard because I want to earn my money. If you want to spread the word that I'm your fianc√©, go ahead. I don't understand a thing anymore. He seemed so rich, and now he's a lifeguard! If I could go out, I would fix him up good! My Peppino, when will be together? - Who knows. - My love... Did you at least find out when they're getting married? I don't want them to cause trouble! Nannina, please, you must keep an eye on them. Yes, but you try to get out soon. You want me or Cerasella to go to talk to the captain? Oh, no, heaven forbid! I will never leave this place! - Run along now, Nannina! - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, my love. May I help you? - May I help you? - I'd like a date. You have the wrong address! We only sell - chinotto, orange juice and beer! - Give me a beer! - Why are you a lifeguard? - A young man like you. You really have a degree? - Easy. You may hurt your hands. - Leave me alone! - Hold still... - Let me go! - Well? - What is it? When I want the lifeguard, I'll call him. Go away! Leave! Is that the way to treat customers? When I behave as a lifeguard, you want me to be a fianc√©, and when I'm a fianc√©, you want me to be a lifeguard! What were you with him? The lifeguard fianc√©! Look at this. Darn it! What are you doing? Leave me alone! Let me out! - You did it on purpose, huh? - No. I wanted to help you. Come here. Hold still! Tell me why you're always so upset with me. Let's sit down a moment. Do you dislike me so much? Answer. You don't like me? You like me? You don't want to say it? - I don‚Äôt' know. - Try to find out. Why? Is it urgent? Not really urgent, but I am curious to know. Did you think of what you'll do when our big act is over? Not yet, but don't worry. What matters is not worrying today. - Tomorrow, whatever God wills! - That's fatalism! What is that? Nothing serious! I don't see how you can passively entrust yourself to destiny. In life you must struggle to get what you want. If only I knew what I wanted! - Sure you don't want anything? - Certainly. Not even inside yourself, in some hidden corner? - There's always a voice there. - What voice? A voice, I don't know. It's... When I was about to marry Alfredo, the voice didn't tell me anything and I was worried because I didn't know what I should do. I waited, but nothing happened. So I reached my wedding day. Only then did I hear it, just as I was entering the church. - What did it say? - "Cerasella, don't do it!" "Alfredo isn't the man for you! Run away!" So I ran away. - You don't believe it? - Yes, yes. Was it the voice to suggest using me as your fianc√©? No, I decided that. Hold still and don't turn around. - What is it? - They're spying on us. It's Nannina. - What are you doing? - Your fianc√©. - Yes, but... - Nannina could find out the truth, if we don't embrace. - What about a kiss? - Are you crazy? A fake kiss! Nannina, come out! I know you're there. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. I was passing by. You're sticking your nose in my affairs. Stop it! Uncle Salvatore, is it a big sin to kiss... Who? - No one. - Then what do you want to know? If you kiss the person you really love... then it's not a sin. On the contrary! Darn! - Who is this person? - Keep calm. You'll find the right one sooner or later. Have you ever heard of love at first sight? Yes, but what's that got to do with it? True love is like a storm. Lightning, thunder, rain... When it arrives, you notice it right away. - Really? - Yes. - Goodbye, Cerasella! - Goodbye! Why do you look at me like this? No reason. I was thinking. Of what? That it hasn't rained or stormed in a long time. What do you mean? Do you like bad weather? No. I meant... I like days when the sun is shining. Now more than ever. You know why? I've begun thinking the way you do. What matters is today. Tomorrow, whatever God wills. That is fatalism! Cerasella, I feel like another person close to you. Why? I don't know. I feel... more serene, happier. I'm glad. Listen. I wanted to ask you... Would you marry a man without money? An ordinary poor guy? How do I know? - Surely I wouldn't marry a rich man! - Why not? Because rich men are selfish and presumptuous. I should marry Alfredo, for example, just because he's rich! What is it? Now you... I've never met a girl like you. - You are... - No, hold still. It's him! Cerasella, it's him! Lightning, thunder, a storm, the voice... Everything! Everything! Bruno, I heard the voice. It said that you... It said that it's you! Invoice, promissory note, promissory note... Why do you open the mail if you already know there are invoices and promissory notes? Mom! What is it? - Mom! What's going on? - Read! Read! Bruno's father wrote. - Read! - He agrees to our marriage. Is that why you felt ill? The emotion! I haven't had such good news in years. He thinks you are still engaged with his son. And he regrets having left him without money. He thinks Bruno is with us. Bruno won't want me anymore. We practically kicked him out. Silly! He must not know about this letter. As of now, you'll do everything I say. - I want to talk to you. - What is it? Nothing. I want to have a chat with you. I'll be right there! Excuse me, but I'm very busy. - What did she want? - A cabin. - What for? - What everyone uses it for. - Get undressed to go swimming. - Here at my place? I don't know. She must like it here. Because you are here! I saw how she looked at you. Let her look! I told you it's over between us. You don't believe me? You don't believe me? Yes, I believe you. May I have an umbrella, Bruno? - Wait! - I am the lifeguard! You're not taking an umbrella to her! Pasqualino! Pasqualino! - Is this umbrella coming? - Just a moment. Take the umbrella to the lady. It's 200 liras an hour. But if you leave within the hour, I'll give it to you free. - Help! - Maria! - Help! - A girl is drowning. I'm drowning! I'll be right back. - Here I am! - Help! - Where is she? - Down there! Move! I'll save her! Push! Push! Who knows if she'll make it! - Well? You're not drowning anymore? - No, I feel better. - I got a cramp, but it's over. - Don't use these petty reasons. - I do what I want. - No! In my beach club you do what I want! - Leave me alone! - Promise you won't show up again. No, I won't promise! - Let me go, you coward! - Breathe and then promise. Let me go! - I won't promise. - What are you saying now? I won't promise... - Promise! - I promise. I promise. Bitch! - Sit down. - Thank you. Thanks. Madam, if you called for me... If you called for me because of your debt with me, it wasn't necessary. 200,000 liras for a customer like you... For you, 200,000 liras is peanuts, huh? - Well... - You have a nice industry! Industry? A business, modestly speaking. Interesting. - Do you have a match? - Right away. No. The reason I had you called is something else. You were to marry a woman named Cerasella, right? - Yes, but she's marrying another man. - No! The other man is marrying my daughter! Yes! If you still intend to marry your Cerasella... this is the moment to act. But be determined and firm. - It's useless with Cerasella. - Nonsense! When a girl is faced with the fact having been done, all she can do is marry the man who has... - Has... - Who has... - I don't understand. - Don't make me go any further. - Will you follow my suggestion? - One suggestion? All of them! - Are you ready to do what I say? - Very ready! - Listen to me carefully. - Excuse me! You are a spiteful witch. Woe to who marries you! It is a serenade of insults! Yes. That way, she'll get angry, come down, and we won't waste time. I won't say "witch" to Cerasella. - Then let's say "anisette"! - Don't joke about it! It is something serious. My happiness is at stake. Something poetic is needed. She's a woman. She's Cerasella. At times she's bitter as a lemon, other times, sweet as a cherry. Lemon and cherry, cherry and lemon. You're a lemon, you're a cherry... You see? You become sweet under the sun that warms you. Hanging melons, and clusters of tomatoes, a tender and sweet plant of roses. In the wind, a shirt and two sheets. That is your balcony. This is what you are. Cerasella, Cerase'. During the lemon period, you slapped me. Cerasella, Cerase'. Now that it's the cherry period, you kiss me. You're a lemon, you're a cherry, you become sweet under the sun that warms you. If it's cold, you're an apple, and the love in your heart freezes. This song flies and says that since this passion is bitter my heart becomes a lemon. Go to hell! Play, idiot! It's why I pay you. - The bath wasn't included. - I'll pay you double. Play! And I live bitter days, sighing. During the lemon period, you slapped me. Now that it's the cherry period, you kiss me. What is going on? It's that stupid Alfredo. I'll go talk to him. Sleep, Uncle Salvatore. If it's cold, you're an apple, and the love in your heart freezes. This song flies and says that since this passion is bitter, you're a cherry or a lemon. You're a cherry, you're a lemon. Cerasella, Cerase'. - Run! - Stop with that broom! I'll take care of it! - Hold this. - Let me go! - Cerasella, I'm sorry. - Let's take her away. - Let me go! No! - Easy! We had agreed not to hurt her. - She poured water on my head! - Better water than the mandolin! - I'll slap you... - Hurry, or I'll leave by myself! You're a scoundrel! Get inside! - Easy! - Close it! Close it. - Do you have a match, please? - Yes. Must we wait much longer here? - No, no. - Thank you. Who is it? - Who is it? - It's Nora. Open. What are you doing here at this hour? I know it's not the best time for a visit, but it's not my fault. During the day the dragon controls you, so I had to come at night. Why? Bruno, you can't go on living this life. Go back to living like normal people. I live very well like this. You hate me for what I said that day, but I swear that I am very sorry. I don't care now whether you're rich or poor. Since that day, many things have happened. Right? You had a good time being Prince Charming incognito. In love with the poor Cinderella. Thank what you want. But the person you call "Cinderella" is not a girl like the others. Yes, I know, she's poor. So much the better! My dear... I have no doubts about Cerasella's poverty, but what about her honesty? - You don't know her. - Do you? - More than you do. - You think? I am sure of it. Then you know where she spends her nights. What do you mean? You see, I know more than you. Go visit her now. You'll find out many interesting things. - Where did she go? - You're asking me? There was a serenade. Cerasella went down to yell at Alfredo. - She was coming right back. - But she never returned! - I'm beginning to understand a lot. - Lucky you! I don't. - That girl made a fool of me. - Young man! Cerasella is an honest girl. If she's not here, there's a reason. Something must have happened to her, and Alfredo knows. Look for Alfredo! - His bed is empty! - Oh, God! Where did he go? He wrote this. "Dear Aunt Rosina, don't worry if you don't find me in bed." "I'm spending the night with Cerasella." "So finally I can marry her! Your Alfredo." That loose woman! What a scandal! What a scandal! Cerasella, forgive me. - I don't want to hurt you. - Why did you bring me here? To frame you. Women must be faced with the fact. What do you want to do? You don't understand? If you... If I... Well, if we both... carry out the fact, you are obliged to marry me. Scoundrel! Scum! Cerasella, let's get this over with! If you don't take me away right now, I'll bust your head! - Where is the van? - Outside. Wait... - Hurry! - First say you forgive me. Speak! Holy Mary! Madonna of Carmine! Another war has broken out! Help! Holy Mary! - Marzano. - Yes, sir. - Go in that ruined house. - Yes, sir. If the coast is clear, give a signal. Call general headquarters, signal our position, and ask for backup. - We must escape the enemy. Go! - Yes, sir. Cover him! This is a divine punishment. "Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa". Stop it! They're surely exercising. It's a fake war! Yes, but the bullets are real! Jesus, Joseph and Mary! Jesus... - Giuseppe! - Hands up! - Alfredo! - Peppino! - What are you doing here? - This coward kidnapped me! Who knows what Bruno will think of me. - You kidnapped her? - Yes... No! I'll tell you everything. - But move this thing. - Tell me, or I'll cause a massacre! Later! I must talk to Bruno now. Where are you going? Are you crazy? They're shooting. Hello? Hello? Wait here. I'll go advise the captain. Don't move. A phone! I'll call Bruno. - Hello? Hello? - You want to get in the war? - Hold this. - Don't move or I'll shoot! - No! It really shoots! - Hello? Here he is! Captain, we must suspend shooting. Why? Are we surrounded? No. There's a woman in that house. A woman? Who is that jerk? She's my sister! What? You want to suspend maneuvers to please your sister? - No, but... - Shut up, idiot! Where is the phone? I said to call the command! - I forgot. - Forgot? It's over! Darn him! Darn him! Hello? Who's talking? I'm Cerasella. I want 88. Yes, Cerasella. - Cerasella? - Who is it? Must be some password. I don't want trouble. She wants 88. Hello? Cerasella is calling. She wants 88. Hello? Who's talking? I don't know Cerasella. Alright. If that's the order... - What're you doing, trouble maker? - Let me go! Hello? Are you Oreste the butcher? Will you call Bruno? Bruno! General, you're wanted on the phone. - It must be your wife. - My wife? Why does she call here? It's a persecution! Hello? General? You didn't understand. I want Bruno, the lifeguard! - What? You'll have me shot. - Leave me alone! - Give it to me. - Marzano! Because of you, we were made prisoners! - Captain, I... - You're going to jail! Cerasella, what did you want? - Where is Bruno? - I don't know. He left this morning. He took away all his stuff. - He was in company. - Who with? The girl who yesterday pretended to drown. No! This time the information is free. I don't speculate on tragedies. What a nerve! After all you did, you have the courage to come looking for him in my home! Didn't your daughter look for him in my home? - Your daughter must leave him alone! - Listen, girl... - Don't call me that! - Alright, miss. I suggest you try with someone else. The hit wasn't successful with Bruno. - What hit? - You know that Bruno is very rich! Rich? He was obliged to be a lifeguard to survive. Don't you realize he was making a fool of you? Anyway, this foolish thing is over now. You should realize that in your social condition... you certainly can't be the girl for him. Why didn't he tell me? Why did he make a fool of me? Think what you want. What matters now is that Bruno marries my daughter. I don't believe it. You are stubborn! Alright. Read here. It's Bruno's father soliciting the wedding. - What about Bruno? - He's in love with my daughter. - No! - Of course he is! I know... He led you to believe the contrary. Poor girl! All men do that when they want to have fun with a girl. - He had fun? - You're not convinced yet? Look. Look. It's over! It's over! Cerasella, what's the matter? Uncle Salvatore, what are you doing? You can't walk alone. Forget it, my child. Tell me why you're crying. I don't know. I felt like crying. Come sit next to me, as you always do. If you feel like crying, go ahead and open up. - It'll go away. - No, it won't! It won't go away! - It's about Bruno, huh? - Yes. He made a fool of me and then he left! Poor Cerasella! Sooner or later it had to happen to you too. You were so much looking for love! The problem is I can't help you this time. But I love him! The more he makes me cry, - the more I feel I love him. - I know. You see, Cerasella, the world has its laws. They are evil laws, but nothing can be done. - Great laws! - That's how the world is. There are many compartments. And one should not travel in a compartment he's not entitled to! I didn't want his money! I found him starving to death. Well, he's rich and has money. He travels in a luxury compartment. Patience, Cerasella. It'll go away, you'll see. One day you'll realize that it was better this way. You just have to be brave. - What are you doing? - I'm not the one who travelled in his compartment. He travelled in mine! So? He has to pay the ticket! There's another woman, Dad. Another woman? Who is she? - Do I know her? - No, you don't. Besides, she's not even a woman. What is she? I mean she's not an ordinary woman. - She is a strange girl. - She's crazy? She seems so, but she isn't. On the contrary. She is simple, a common woman. She is certainly not high class. - Her name is Cerasella. - Great! We have come to a common girl, lower class! So you don't want to marry Nora because of this Cesarella. Cerasella! - I didn't say I want to marry her. - What do you want, then? I don't know. Cerasella is a different sort of girl. Until yesterday, I'd have done anything for her. - And today? - Forget it! Let's not talk about it. But Cerasella isn't a woman like the others. - You said the same about Nora. - You don't know Cerasella! She may have many bad points, but... she is generous and disinterested. - Who do you think helped me? - Big effort! She knew you had money and you'd pay here back a lot. - It's not true! - It's true! Yes? Who is it? Who? What does she want? Oh! She brought the bill! Alright, have her come up. I'll be waiting. - You know who it was? - Who? Your Cesarella, the disinterested girl. - She wants to see me? - No, me! - She wants money. So I imagined! - Oh, no... - It's not possible. - Then stay here and listen. No. I had better go. Generous, disinterested. I had really guessed! You said you were poor! Instead... At least I didn't deceive you. I am really poor! But I'm not stupid! Did you have fun? Now pay up! My father is waiting for you for this. Go on! - Bruno. - What is it? I've no time to waste. - Is someone waiting for you? - Yes! Then go to her! She is the right woman for you. Sure! And I'll marry her right away. - Come in. - May I? Come. - Are you his father? - Yes. - I am his father. - I am Cerasella. I am honored. Sit down. - You should know that... - Save the preface. I know everything. Get to the point. How much? How much? Whatever amount as long as this matter ends. Yes, 3,375 liras. - How much? - Does it seem like too much? I won't take advantage. I only want what I spent. Look. Here. Lunch and dinner for 15 days is 350 liras a meal, which makes 10,500 liras. I had him eat meat every day. And 10 cigarettes a day, makes 1,275 liras. The lifeguard outfit that he took with him, 3,600 liras. Minus the lifeguard pay without welfare, makes 12,000 liras. 3,375 liras remain. Does it add up? - What? - Does the accounting add up? Yes, of course! In fact... Who should I make this check out to? Cerasella. Everyone knows me. I believe it! A thrifty, precise girl, a good administrator like you. Tell me something. What was Bruno like as a lifeguard? Terrible! I never told him to avoid mortifying him. - You want to know more? - Yes. Would you marry someone like my son? - Me? Not on my life! - Why not? Because... because he's like all the others. Besides, he's rich and travels in another compartment. - What compartment? - The one rich people travel in. I don't want to travel with the rich. They're all selfish and presumptuous! - Not all of them. - Yes, all of them! Excuse me, but I'll bet you are too! - Calm down. - Why do you make fun of me? Enough! What did I do to you? Leave me alone. Understand? Leave me alone! - Nannina, don't joke! - I swear. She said to come tell you she'll marry you right away. Really? Why didn't she come to tell me? I don't know. She was agitated. She also said, "Luckily everything is ready, even the publications." "I'm sorry I had poor Alfredo wait." - What a dear! - Don't trust her. It's what she thinks today. But tomorrow? You know she's crazy! No. This time, this is it! Cerasella went to the station to get a permit for her brother. My jacket! I'm sorry. Soldier Marzano is in a penalty cell. - Let me talk to the captain. - He is under arrest too. Because of you, that matter about the call with the general, the maneuvers were suspended. Excuse me. The colonel is coming. Attention! Leave, please. - Present arms! - Go away! Alright! - Lieutenant! - Yes, sir. - Who is it? - Cerasella. The password for the battalion maneuvers... Alright! Come forward! - I have something to tell you. - Please, it's all my fault. I am a mess. All I do is cause trouble. - Why bother living? - Why did you come here? Colonel, release my brother. I must marry right away. I want to get married right away! He's the only relative I have. We'll see. - Tell me yes or no right away! - You give me orders? Excuse me. I can't tell you why, Colonel. - You wouldn't understand! - Oh! But I swear it is urgent. If you were a soldier, I'd have given you 30 days in jail. But you are a woman and pretty too. I bow to you. Your brother will be released. - Go on. - Thank you! Thank you! I hope I don't get arrested, too! Marzano, go to the dormitory and get ready. Your sister is waiting. - What happened? - She wants to marry. Hurry. The colonel gave you a 5 day leave of absence. To me, he gave 5 days in prison, thanks to your sister! - You must help me. Hurry! - What do you want? You're all invited to the wedding. This time Cerasella must not run off! Of course, Nora is a beautiful girl. She has class. She has you give a good impression. I felt the same way you did. But then I married a simple woman. Your mother. And she was our good fortune! Enough, Dad! I know what you mean. But it's useless. I've decided. Right. Also because that girl, Cesarella... Excuse me, Cerasella. - She's getting married. - When? I heard the wedding is at noon. - Almost time. What do you care? - In fact! - My car is downstairs. - What should I do with it? Nothing! I just mentioned it! My car is there. I forgot the keys inside. The wedding gown is lovely! The seamstress just finished it. Too bad Bruno can't see it! It brings bad luck to see it before the wedding. Of course not! We want to see it. Right, Bruno? Yes! Elisa, what petty ideas! It's not worthy of you! Call your daughter. We want to admire this lovely wedding gown. - Call your daughter. - As you wish, dear. - Nora! - What is it, Mom? Come here a moment. Bruno wants to admire your wedding gown. - Aren't you superstitious? - Me? - I've never been superstitious! - Come, dear. - Mom, it brings bad luck. - Forget it. Look, Bruno. Do you like it? It's beautiful, isn't it? Don't marry her! She isn't the woman for you! Run, Bruno! Bruno, what's the matter? You're not saying anything? Run! Yes, Nora, you're very pretty. Excuse me. Everyone, excuse me. But... Come, let's go! Attention! Stop! - Who are you? - Who are you? - Where are you going? - Let me go! I'm Bruno. Don't marry him! The voice... I hear the voice! I don't hear anything. Let me go! What do you want? Cerasella! You again? Stop him! Get him! - Get him! - Enough! I'll get angry! - I told you! - Be quiet, Auntie! Get the bride and bring her here! Here she is! We brought her back. - Cerasella, finally! - What do you want from me? Darn! - It's not her. She's another one! - Another one? Sorry. She's what we found. Do as we military do, make the best of it. Don't run! If she marries one or the other, what's the difference? - As long as she decides! - You're right!
