-I'm making spaghetti for dinner. You still like spaghetti, right? -Mm-hm. Jehovah God, our Father, we thank you for this meal you have provided us. And we thank you for bringing Jaime to us safely. We pray that she will feel your love and wisdom in her heart. We ask you these things in the name of your son, Christ Jesus, amen. -Amen. -They used to be one of my favorite bands. -They did? -Yeah, I saw them play in Montreal on the Tinderbox tour. -Really? -Really? -I used to go to lots of shows before I met your aunt. -I don't want to know about that. -I do. Does Jean-François ever do the dishes? -He worked all day. -So did you. -He's studying to become a ministerial servant. There's a lot of reading. I hope you packed something nice to wear to the meeting tomorrow. -Oh, I was thinking maybe I'd skip those. -No. Absolutely not. -I know they're important to you, but-- -The Truth is a huge part of our lives. I don't want to have to bother your mother about this. Okay? -Fine. -Besides, you might enjoy it. -Though rosy lips and cheeks with… You're, uh, Jaime Buckley? -Yeah. -Class started 15 minutes ago. -There was a problem with the paperwork. Sorry. -Though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come… -Where you from? -Thunder Bay. -Nate. -Jaime. -How's your French? -It's not good. -Well, lucky for you there's English school. Why'd you move here? -Family stuff. -Yish. -Yeah. Well, see you around. -See you around. -What do you think? -Of what? -This dress? For the meeting tonight. -That's tonight? -You know it is. Come on. I chose the only one that wasn't frilly. -I can't just wear this? -Jeans? No, never. We leave in 20 minutes. Please rise. Please be seated. Thank you for that beautiful song. Brothers and sisters, Jehovah has given us the chance to live forever in his righteous new system. There's nothing of value in Satan's worldly temptations. We see proof of that every day. And as it is revealed to us in Ephesians, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers--" Jaime. Right? How come you're hiding out here? -I thought we'd be leaving right away. -The sisters like to visit after the meeting. They really like to chat. -I'm Marike. -Do I call you "Sister Marike"? -It sounds weird when you say it. -Feels weird to say. -Was it your first meeting? -No. I use to come a couple times when I was a kid. But my parents… -They're not in the Truth? -No. You ready? -I guess we're leaving now. -Guess so. See you later? -Bye. -Bye. Marike from the meeting asked me over for dinner this week. -She did? That's wonderful. You should go! -Marike's a lovely girl… her sister is too. -It's just dinner. Take it easy. -Hey. -Hey. -We didn't have a chance to meet the other night. I'm Frank. -Jaime. -We're really glad to have you here. Make yourself at home. Girls, I'm in the kitchen. You must be the new friend. I'm Amanda. -My aunt made these. -Dessert! Thank you. How are you settling in? -Good, I think. -Must be a lot of big changes. Uh, do you two mind putting these on the table? I just don't have time anymore when I'm pioneering every day. Especially with having to make dinner and then now, I'm doing a lot more laundry because he's doing all these extra-- Amanda. -Yeah? -Time to give thanks, hun. -Oh. Thank you, our Father, for this food you've blessed us with this evening. Thank you for choosing us to be your witnesses. Thank you for the honor to preach your good news. Please forgive our transgressions And give us the strength to overcome cruelty with grace, and hatred with love. Jehovah is our strength and our shield… Amen. -Amen. Potatoes? Thank you. These are really good. That was on my list. What list? -Of places we were going to visit when we went to Europe. My dad and I were supposed to go next summer. -You'll go one day. What else was on your list? -London. Barcelona. Prague is supposed to be really cool. All the obvious places, I guess. -Those don't sound obvious. -There's this one town in Italy. Lucca, it's called. It's got this ancient tower with oak trees growing out of the top. -That sounds really beautiful. -Have you ever been to Europe? -No. But my mom did once. She brought back tons of pictures. -Where is your mom? -She's not in the Truth anymore. -Do you ever see her? -Not since I was six. -Really? -We're supposed to imagine that she's dead. Do you play the piano? -No. -It's easy. -It's not. -Come here. All you have to do is press the key I tell you when I say so. -Oh, you're right, it is easy. One step at a time. Now this time wait for me. Perfect. Okay, this time, I won't tell you when to come in. -Did I do it right? Mm-mm. Girls, I just put Evan to bed. Do you mind keeping it down? -Sorry. -It's getting kind of late, don't you think, Jaime? -Yeah, I should probably get going. Sorry. I…I didn't think you'd still be up. -I couldn't sleep. -I'm sorry if you were worried. We just ended up hanging out and talking. -It's fine. Do you want some tea? Sure. -Did you have a good time? -Uh, yeah. Yeah, it was nice. Do you know where Marike's mom is? -Did you ask Frank that? -No… Marike said that she left. Kate was disfellowshipped. -She got kicked out? -No-one's allowed to have any contact with her. -What did she do? -She chose to leave. And that's all I'm gonna say about it. -Marike said that she's supposed to pretend that she's dead. -I know how that must sound, but it makes it easier for the kids. We've all had to make sacrifices to live in the Truth. -Have you? -Of course. -But like that? -Jean-François and I really wanted to have children. But when we got married, we decided that we would wait until the new system to start a family. -But the new system never came. -Not yet. I'm really happy you're making friends. Are you sure you want tea? You look so tired. -Maybe I'll just go to bed. -Okay. -Mm. -Hey. -Hey. -Wanna hang? So…are you a Jehovah? -Who told you that? -Uhh, I don't know. People were just saying. -They're called Jehovah's Witnesses. And no, I am not. -Oh. Hey, is it true that you guys think, like, birthdays and Christmas are, like, Satanic? -No. They say pagan. -Oh. Okay. So, why'd you move here again? -My mom kind of lost it after my dad died. She just needed space. -That sucks, man. Sorry. -It's okay. -How'd he die? -Heart attack. He was at work. I was at school. I got called to the principal's office and everyone was laughing because they thought I got in trouble. Sorry, man. Is… is-is it okay that I asked? -Most people don't say anything. I think they're afraid to sound stupid. -I will never be afraid to sound stupid. How did you even get keys to this place? My brother-in-law works here a few nights a week as a security guard. I made a copy. Really? Isn't it beautiful? It's Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion. -Is this a JW thing? -No. This is much too fancy. Somebody painted it in the 1800s. It used to travel around the world and it somehow just ended up here. -Well, it kind of looks like something from one of your magazines. Are you trying to convert me? -Not unless you want me to. -So, you, uh, you really believe in this Armageddon stuff, huh? What stuff? -That you'll all live forever and have wild animals as your pets? -It's not going to be the end of the world like you think. It's more like a renewal. -What about all the fire and brimstone stuff? -There'll be war and famine. Disease. -All that's already happening though. -Exactly. It's just another sign that this whole system of things is coming to an end. -So, is there actually gonna be an Armageddon? -There'll be a huge war. And when it's done, that's when the new system will start. -And that's when you get your pet lion. -Are you making fun of me? -No. I'm sorry. I wanna hear. -It'll be paradise. Nobody will die or get old. And everyone who's died will come back to life. Are you okay? -Yeah. I should just probably be getting home. -Well, I'll walk you. -No, that's okay. You can show me how to get out of here though. -Sure. Have you been baptized, Jaime? -Amanda! -What? I was just asking. I'm not, no. -Is that something you'd consider in the future? -Um, I'm not sure it's for me. Baptism is the most important promise you'll ever make. No need to rush. You wouldn't marry someone before dating them, would you? When people come into the Truth, there should always be a period of courtship before the big commitment. -Is that supposed to make her want to be baptized? I thought it was a good analogy. What about field service? -I-I don't know. I've never done it. Well, you should give it a shot. It's pretty rewarding. Take her out next time. -Only if she wants to. You should sleep over tonight. -I would have to check with my aunt and uncle first. -I'll get my dad to call. They won't mind. -You fell asleep with these on. Come over for dinner tonight. -Again? -Yeah. -Aren't you getting sick of me? -I don't think that's possible. -Um, I have plans after school. -Cancel them. - I can't. - But I'll come over after. -Ugh, fine. -Good night. -You're gonna go and, like, knock on doors with them and everything? -I don't know. -So, you are a Jehovah. Mm. -Don't you worry about getting caught down here? -Doing what? Oh. Well, my parents would actually have to notice me first. -That's heartbreaking. Hm. Poor me, right? -You have a private basement where you can smoke up and play video games. You have your own car. You don't get to complain about-- you have it all. -No. -No, you do. -No, I don't have my own car… and I don't have a girlfriend. -Shit. Can you give me a lift? Who was it that dropped you off? -Oh, that's just Nate. -Nate? -Yeah, he's in my English class. -Is he your boyfriend? -Amanda! I don't know what she was thinking, asking all those questions. It's so rude. You're a guest. -You mean about Nate? It's fine. I don't care. -It's not like you're into him. -Yeah, we're just friends. -Does your aunt know? -Know what? -That you go to his house? Why would she care? All we do is hang out and play Genesis. -What do you mean you-- you play Genesis? -Sega Genesis. It's just video games. -You know what a video game is? -Do you wanna stay over again? -Okay. -I made you something. -You did? -It's your ancient tower… In Lucca. -Where are you going today? -Um, we're going to Vine. We're going to start with the cul-de-sac there, and I think there's some apartments around there. We're going to-- - Good morning! - Morning. I made pancakes. Are you hungry? -Yes, please. -So, what did you decide? -About? -Field service. Marike and Evan are going out this morning. -I-I wouldn't know what to do. Oh, there's nothing to it. "Advertise, advertise, advertise, the King in his kingdom." I think you might be really good at pioneering, Jamie. -I won't even be able to talk to most people. -I'll do the talking. Come on. It'll be fun. This one time. -You can borrow one of Marike's dresses. -No. No dresses. Field service report for Marike and Evan. -And Jaime. -I don't want a record of this. -You don't want a record of our very first field service together? -Mm-hm. -Was that good? -Are you kidding me? He took a magazine and he donated five dollars. Voilà. -No. This is all wrong. -Just taste it. See? Perfect. -No, not even close. This is too soupy. -You're not supposed to use milk, just butter, because milk dilutes the cheesiness. -Wrong. Do you know toy boat? No. You say it-- you say it ten times fast. Toy boat. It's a tongue twister. We have to say it together. - Toy boat. - On three. One, two, three. -Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. - Toy boat. Toy boyt. - Oh, I… Agh! I can't do it. -Yeah, again. -I'm not really good at this. -Again. -Okay. Toy boat. Toy boyt. -Help. Help me. -How do I help you? You can live in my house. It's okay. Oh! -Offbeat Italians… Offbeat Italians? "Play Pong on the early '80s game system or sip mixed drinks to the beat of the background--" In fact, you're a handy man in the kitchen. Been doing for myself a long time. You have never been married? No. Why? Guess I've never been once. -Do you ever go swimming down there? - No. - It's freezing. There's this lake near where I live and if you fall in, even in the summertime, you have about 30 seconds before you die of hypothermia. We should live up here. -Find a little boxcar in the woods? -And live with all our other orphaned brothers and sisters. -You read Boxcar Children too? -Mm-hm. My mom read it to me when I was little. -Mine did too. -Some of my best memories are from my mom reading to me. Sometimes I wish I didn't remember anything about her. -Don't wish that. Hello? That's really good, Mom. I'm glad you're feeling better. Okay. I love you. Bye. -Well, that's some good news, don't you think? -Yeah. Do I have to go back right away? -I don't see any reason to rush. -Okay. Because it's a lot, with school and everything. -We love having you here. And I'm sure your mom could use the extra time to get back on her feet. So, let's just… take it slow. Okay? -Okay. Hey! Hey, what's up? -Do you want to see a movie tonight? -Maybe. What's playing? -Dracula just came out, if you're not too scared, or I kind of wanna see-- - Oh, shit. - What? -I just have to go to the meeting tonight. -You'd rather go to a Jehovah meeting than see Dracula? -I'm sorry. I promised. -Promised who? -Marike. -Right. Right. Okay. All right. Well, your loss. Have fun. -I'm sorry. -Hm, okay. Hey. "And the dry, desiccated earth will become a pool and the thirsty land springs of cool water." I love what Isaiah is getting at here. He's telling us that Jehovah has a plan for us. A plan for restoration, restoration for the righteous. -Hey, guys. Jaime, this is Simon. -Hi. We're gonna get going now. -Okay, bye. -Bye. -Jamie, do you mind staying behind for a sec? I could use a hand. -Sure. -Is that okay? -Yeah. I'll stay too. -No, no. You gotta ride with Dad. -It's fine. -You sure? -Must be nice to have found a new friend so fast. -Yeah. -We were new here once, too. It's not always easy, especially when you live in the Truth. -Yeah, Marike doesn't seem to have a lot of friends. -That's not true. She has the whole congregation. And now she has you. The meetings are pretty long, huh? They do drag a bit. Yeah. -Well, they're really important to us. -I know. -They can be hard for kids. Evan always gets bored. But he doesn't horse around. He doesn't draw on magazines. -I'm sorry. I-I didn't-- -My sister's not usually so easily distracted. -Sorry. It's fine. You're new at this. It's not all meetings, you know. Pioneering brings me a lot of joy. I get to share the Truth with people. There's so much about this life that's wonderful. Hey. Hey, what's up? - I was bored. - I thought you might be here. You bummed about something? -It's my birthday. -What?! Happy birthday. Oh, you're not allowed to celebrate those, right? That's shitty. -It's not that. This is just the first birthday I've had since my dad died. My mom called the other day, and she didn't even mention it. -Well… wanna get some cake? Can-can I have a bite? -You may have one crumb. -Hey, I need at least ten crumbs. I don't care if it's your birthday. -Five crumbs. -Deal. -Hey, what are you guys up to? -It's her birthday. -It's not a big deal. -We're on our way to get our skates sharpened. -Anyway, we just saw you guys. I'm sorry if we interrupted. -You didn't interrupt anything. It's fine. -I'm sure we'll see you soon. -Bye. Um… Sorry. Cup of joe. -It's not a cup of joe. -Jaime, can we have a word? -What's going on? -Take a seat. Frank called. He's concerned. -About…? -Look, I know this is gonna sound funny, but he's worried about your influence. -My influence? -You're… worldly. -You know we don't celebrate birthdays. -Is this about the cake? Are you serious? I'm sorry, I was sad. My friend wanted to cheer me up, so he bought me some cake. -You can do whatever you want. But if you want to spend any more time with Marike, you need to respect her beliefs. -It's not like I invited her to celebrate with me. They ran into us by accident. -I know, but she and Amanda and who knows who else saw you, okay? People are talking. -All we're asking is that you're respectful. We're very happy that you're friends and we want you to be able to stay that way. -Are you going to stop us from being friends? Frank would like it, if you're going to spend time together, that you do it in a more supervised setting. -Supervised? Like with a chaperone? -This isn't a joke, Jaime. If you two are gonna hang out so much, you're gonna have to take part in community activities while you do. -I already go to the meetings. -And that's good. -There's also Bible study, field service. There's a lot you can do together. You know, if you're still planning on staying. -Fine. You understand? -I said fine. I'll try not to embarrass you guys anymore. If you wanted me to leave, you should have just said so. -Jamie-- -Hey. -Are you allowed to talk to me? -What? Of course. -We're not gonna get in trouble? -What are you talking about? -I-I just thought we weren't allowed to hang out unless it was in Bible study or whatever. -Who told you that? -My uncle did. Your dad called him. -Really? -Look, I'm sorry if I got you in trouble with that whole birthday thing. I really didn't think anyone would see us. -It's really not that big of a deal. -Your dad's not mad? -My dad loves you. Everyone does. Hey, I got you something. -I thought you weren't allowed to give birthday presents. -Did I say it was for your birthday? -Hm, right. -Sorry, we don't have any wrapping paper at home. When I saw it, I thought of you. -It's a meteorite. -Mm-hm. Do you like it? -I love it. My mom called the other day. She wants me to come home. She's feeling a lot better. -She is? That's good. So, are you going to… go home? -I don't really want to. -I don't really want you to, either. Come with me to Bible study. It won't be so bad. My dad's gonna forget about all of this. -Okay. -Promise to come? -Mm-hm. "Is there anything of which we can say, "'See, this is new'? "It has already existed for all time. "No one remembers that which is gone, and those who come after us will not remember us." -Bye. Are you sure you don't want a ride? -Oh, you're in the opposite direction. Thanks, but we'll walk. Are we allowed to do this? We're just walking home. If you say so. So, what do you think? Of what? Of the whole thing. -Oh, I wasn't really paying attention. It was okay. -Would you want to pray with me? -Really? -Come on. It makes me feel good. Would you just try it? -Okay. -Close your eyes. Jehovah, thank you for bringing me Jaime when she needed me most. And when I needed her. Pioneering this weekend? -Sure. -Good. See you then. - Hey. - Yo. Where are you coming from? -Bible study. -For real? -Yeah. I got in trouble. -For what? -Being worldly. -Ooh, what does-- what does that mean? -I don't know. Being normal. -So, they're making you take Bible study? -They're not making me. It's just if I want to keep hanging out with Marike, I have to. -They're trying to turn into a Jehovah. -Don't worry, I'm not gonna get all religious on you. It just sucks that I have to keep pretending. We kissed. -Wait, you and Marike? -No, me and Jehovah. -Yeah, me and Marike. -Well, what was it like? -I don't know. I'm… I'm not even sure if it was a real kiss. -Well, was it weird? -It happened right after she said a prayer. So…yes. Well, you gonna do it again? -I don't know. -So, you like girls, hey? -Yeah. -Cool. -You're the only person here who knows. -Really? -Are you surprised? No. It was pretty obvious anytime I've seen you guys together. -Yeah. That's the problem. -Let's try here. -How are we gonna get in? -We get lucky. -I thought you said you were good at this. So, what do you think about Simon? -Simon? -Marco's friend. -Um… -We should all go out together sometime. It could be fun. -Like go to a movie or something? -Yeah. Something like that. I don't think my dad would mind. -Okay. -So later this week maybe? -Yeah. How's it going? -Good. -You like movies? -Uh…yeah. -Come here. Turn around. -Why? -Please just turn around. -Should we go back? Not yet. Here ya go. -Thanks. See ya. -Wait a minute. She forgot her scarf. Hey. -Yeah? -Hey. How was the movie? -Good. -How did Simon and Jamie get along? -I don't know. They don't have a lot in common. -Not like you and her. -Do you ever think about Mom? -No. -I do. -You don't even remember her. -I remember some things. -You were so little when she left. -Don't you miss her? -Of course I do. -I feel like I'm not allowed to ask about her. -Just don't ask Dad. Should I pack a lunch for Marike as well? -Sure. -So two lunches? -Um, just throw in an extra fruit roll-up or something. -Okay. You two have been going out in service so much lately. It's really nice to see. -It's not so bad. Thanks. -Enjoy yourselves. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. We actually didn't do too badly today. Talked to seven people, gave away a bunch of magazines. I definitely want to do another call to that house on Pine. That lady there seemed like she might be interested. Do you remember how many magazines she took? -No, I don't remember. -I'll just put down that she took one Citadel. -Yeah, put that. What are you thinking? -I'm just imagining you being baptized. -Really? -That's what I was thinking about. Right. Sorry I asked. Not gonna let me go? What do you got next? -Social studies. -Mm, no. -Mm, yeah. -Skip with me. -Really? -Yeah. You never skip? -No. Won't we get caught? -Nobody cares. Okay, fine. But I get to pick what we do. -Does this actually count? -This is just for us. Do you recognize yourself as a sinner, needing salvation from Jehovah God? -No. Do you have to say it like that? Do you recognize yourself as a sinner? -I do. -And have you repented of your sins? -I have. -Do you dedicate yourself to the truth forever and ever? I do. We should go next summer. -Where? -Backpacking. You don't want to? You just have to be patient. I wish you were my first kiss. -I wish you were mine. -Did you have a boyfriend? -No…but there was this girl. It wasn't like anything serious. I wasn't very nice to her. Are you jealous? -No, of course not. -You have a boyfriend. -This is so different. -I know. Do you want to go in for a second? -You can. I'll wait. -What's wrong? -Nothing. -Yeah, right. You're being weird. -I can't stop thinking about what you told me. About that girl. I know it's not fair, but I hate it. I hate thinking about it. -It's over. It's been over for a really long time. And it wasn't even a real thing. Jaime? -Yeah. Hi, sweetheart. Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. -Dinner's ready. It's just us tonight. JF called, said he won't be home till later. -You can go ahead without me. I'm not really hungry. -Are you sure? -I'm not feeling very well. Probably just tired. -I'll put a plate in the fridge for you in case you change your mind. -Okay. Are you okay? -They know. -I think JF saw us. -He came to see my dad last night. -Is he mad? Your dad? -He thinks this is… all a big test. -Is that what you think? -Everything is a test. -Aren't you afraid that they're gonna kick you out? -They wouldn't do that. -They did it to your mom. -No. She left. -Would you? Would you come with me if I went home? -I want to. -Okay, so come with me. -I'll talk to them. I know what to say. I have to get back. -You're gonna try, right? -I promise. Coming to the meeting? -I-I didn't think… You don't have to come. -No, she should come. I'm giving my first talk tonight. -I'll get changed. It's fine. Let's just go. Welcome, everyone. I feel very humbled to be able to open today's meeting. Please open your songbooks to page 48 for "Come Spread the News." Brother Josué, would you lead us in song? -Everybody. Thank you. Ecclesiastes 2. "I said in mine heart, Go to now, "I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: "and, behold, this is also vanity. "I said of laughter, It is mad, "and of mirth, What do with it? I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine…" -I'd like to share a verse that I've always cherished. I think you'll agree it's one of the loveliest verses in First Corinthians. "Love is patient and love is kind. It is not selfish or boastful. Love is not jealous, not full of pride. It is not quick to anger. Love does not rejoice in evil. It cherishes truth. It can bear all things. True love is belief… is hope. And above all, love simply endures. For eternity." I wanted to end tonight's meeting with these thoughts on love from Corinthians for a reason. And that's because I have some news tonight. Some very happy news. I'm overjoyed to announce the engagement of my youngest daughter, Marike, to Brother Marc-Olivier Lavoie. They're going to be married next spring! -She's upstairs. -I know this doesn't make sense to you. -They can't force you to do this. -Nobody forced me. It was my idea. All it matters is that in the new system, we're both there. You and me. -That's why you're getting married? -If we both live in the Truth, we won't have to be apart. -What am I supposed to do? Nobody wants me here. -I'll talk to my dad. He'll talk to your uncle. It'll be okay. You won't have to leave. -Am I supposed to marry Simon then? -When paradise comes, we can be there. We'll be together forever. We can do all the things that we planned. -You don't have to do this. Please. Just come with me. Please. -I can't. -Why are you doing this for something that's never gonna happen?! -It is gonna happen. So soon. I can't be there without you. -I don't believe in it. -You don't have to. I can believe enough for both of us. Please. I love you. Stay. Stay. You're doing the right thing. You got what you wanted. -I didn't think everything was going to happen so fast. That's not why I wanted you to come to the meeting. -Yes, it is. That's exactly why you asked me. -The congregation is all we have. -What are you doing here? -I don't know. I came to say goodbye in person. -Come visit me sometime. -Yeah, maybe I will. -Um… oh, here. Take care of your guy for me, all right? -Bye. -Bye. I know things can be… confusing at your age. But-- I'm not confused. I know you're not. She is. I'm sorry if I made things difficult for you. I just hope that they don't do anything to you because of me. -That's not while you're leaving, is it? Because if-- -It isn't. -You're not gonna pretend I'm dead, are you? -I love you. No matter what. When do you have to go? Argh, my train leaves at seven. Aw. Go back to sleep. Just lock my door when you leave. - Okay. - I'll see you next week? -I'll call you. -Have fun with the Jehovahs. -Your aunt told me you were coming in this weekend. I asked if it was okay if I picked you up. Is it okay? -Yeah. Well then, get in. That's Luca. -Hi, Luca. How old is he? -A year and a half. -He looks like you. -Sometimes, when he's really annoyed at me, he makes this face that reminds me of you. Let's take the long way. School's good? -Yeah. I finish next year. I went to Europe. Last summer. -I know. Your aunt gave them to me. -She never told me that. -I asked her not to. -You really read all of these? -About a million times. Was it like we imagined? You should have been there. -Are you okay? -I think about you all the time. About us. Do you? -Every day. -No, wait. -Not gonna let me go?
