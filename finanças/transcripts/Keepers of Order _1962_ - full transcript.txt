Akagi sure looks gloomy today. The Kunisada are trapped like rats. It's execution time for Chuji. Well? They're surging on the mountain! From all sides, by the hundreds! There's no way out of the mountain! So this is it. What's going to happen to Boss Kunisada? What did he do wrong? All he did was give us rice! And ask the sheriff to ease up on our taxes! I know. The sheriff's in cahoots with the Hasshu marshal! His posse's made up of Onijizo's kin! That two-faced Onijizo Matsugoro's after Boss Kunisada's turf! That's right! Calm down! Calm down or you'll play right into the sheriff's hands. That outlaw Chuji is finished. Now we have the south Kanto provinces under control, Seiichiro. We have to squeeze the peasants for all they're worth, and put those outlaws in their place. Got that, Matsugoro? No need to remind me, Sir Nakayama. I do have the law in my hand. Good, good. You'll be one of the biggest gambling bosses in the Hasshu provinces, like Iioka of Shimogusa. I have one more big rival to take care of, though. You mean Omaeda Eigoro? How is he, Seiichiro? I hear he's ailing. Leave Omaeda to me. I'll take care of him with Matsugoro when I'm done with Chuji. Good planning. The peasants are making a commotion. Get out of control and I'll throw them all in jail. Good idea. I'll warn the village squire tonight. You do that. Someone! You..! Want something with me? It's Chuji, men! You're wasting your breath. You sent them all to Mt. Akagi. I won't stay long. I just want to ask one thing. The last 3 years have been lean ones for the peasants and they can barely keep themselves fed. What will you do about taxes this year? Back off! I'm asking the sheriff. Well, sheriff? What do you plan to do? Kill him, Seiichiro! It's Chuji! Arrest him! You leave me no choice. Kunisada Chuji is fiercer than the devil, someone said. He kills with a smile on his face! Are you the crack Hasshu marshal Nakayama? If you're in cahoots with the likes of Matsugoro, you're just another greedy, money-hungry louse! Boss! The sheriff's posse's coming back. I won't let you have your way around here, not so long as I live! You're wanted! Don't bother with these small fry! Run! Everyone here? All of us. Come on! After them! Round up a posse! After them! The boss won! The sheriff's dead! Be quiet! What if the officers hear you? Let's all go home. So what happens now, dad? I don't know. I know what drove Boss Chuji to do what he did, but this is bad. Brother..? Where were you? Dad, I killed Onijizo Matsugoro. What? I never dreamed Boss Kunisada would make the first move and attack the sheriff's office. I figured he'd be arrested, the village would fall prey to that sheriff and Matsugoro, and I had to do something. I took this sword I had hidden away, and snuck over to the sheriff's office. That's when Boss Chuji came out after killing the sheriff, and in all the commotion, I killed Matsugoro. You didn't! Did the officers see you? What are we going to do, dad? I can't stay in this village, dad. I don't want to cause you and Omitsu trouble. Disown me right now. The officers can't hold you responsible for a son you've disowned. I have to go now. Forgive me, dad. Take care of dad, Omitsu. Wait, Tomokichi. I won't try to stop you. You do what you have to. But don't you ever forget the toiling peasants. I won't. I loaned out money to struggling villagers, so this is all I have. You take it. Dad..! Now go. Don't worry about us. Don't let anyone see you. Boss Chuji once told me where he goes when he leaves Mt. Akagi. Let's see. Let's see. It says Kunisada Chuji's wanted. He slew the sheriff and fled. Now that's a yakuza for you. Chuji really did it. I'm so proud of him. I gave that guy food to eat. We shared drinks as sworn brothers. Those were the days. Bet that Chuji's thinking about us somewhere. Beat it. What do you want? Now what was that you were just saying? Boss, that was just... Since you remember Chuji so well, come tell me about it. We meant Chuji, the greengrocer. That Chuji. Right! Get serious? Sorry, sir! Who are you? You must be a man of the law and an important one. Don't bother with these jokers. That's right, sir. Excuse us. Tell me something. What is it? Do you know where Kunisada Chuji went? Why do you want to know? I have to see Chuji. And what? I want to give him a hand. What? But if a lawman like you doesn't know, I'll have to go ask at the sheriff's office. What's your name and where are you from? I'm just a vagrant samurai, no one important. But I'll tell you anyway. I'm Hirate Miki. Hirate Miki? Please. Long time no see, Hirate. Fancy office for a Hasshu marshal. Only for now. I'm the acting sheriff until his replacement gets here. I heard Kunisada Chuji killed him. News spreads fast along the highway. I just gave a lawman a ribbing about it. The cornered rat bit the cat. I heard you were right there. I don't know how good a swordsman Chuji is, but surely you could have saved the sheriff. Did you stand there and watch so you could be the next sheriff? What do you think? Well, never mind. Give me wine instead of tea. I know. I heard you left Chiba Fencing School, but I didn't expect you to look me up. I traveled throughout Kanto but got bored, and that's when I thought of you. And mooching off me for wine? You could say that. You were the best fencer at Chiba Fencing School, and now you're just a vagrant samurai. That's how it is. You can't get a commission without connections. I was your rival and look at me. I'm still a lowly Hasshu marshal, patrolling Kanto for outlaw yakuza, bums, and peasants. Making money on the side with two-faced lawmen? Say what you like. That's how I can afford to give you an allowance. Here's 10 ryo, Miki. But I could give you twice or three times as much. What do I have to do? Kunisada Chuji can take on any Hasshu officer. I think you could kill him. Not for small change. What? No deal necessary. I'll kill Chuji. I have a purpose now, something I lost when I left Chiba Fencing School. Sure you don't know where Chuji is? I just got news. - Something's up, boss. - What? I saw smoke coming from the old tea stall on the pass. That's odd. There's no one living there. Boss, flares went up from the east and west peaks. Flares? They're here. We have to climb down to the valley, and find our way to Shinshu Road. The sun will go down soon and they'll never find us in the valley. Put out the fire before we go. This is someone's charcoal shed. Who's there?! Excuse me. Who are you? You're Nizaemon's son. Yes, Tomokichi. Come inside. This place is surrounded. The posse's closing in. Thanks for the warning. But what are you doing up here? Please, boss. Make me your henchman. Make me one of you. What are you saying? The squire won't like it. My dad disowned me. Disowned you? Don't bring your family problem to us. We don't need it! I killed Onijizo Matsugoro in front of the Sheriff's Office. You killed Matsugoro? I set my mind to it when I learned you were surrounded on Mt. Akagi. So the squire told you about this place? Please take me with you. I'm the one who drove you, the squire's heir, to this... and I have to warn you. If you come with me, you'll be an outlaw for life. Think it over, for your own sake. No, I've made up my mind. I'll follow you, whether you let me or not. What a problem. We have to hurry, boss. Nikko. Split this money among the men. Why split the money now, boss? What for, if we're all going together? What's the idea, boss? Never mind. We can't stay together. I want each of you to lay low for a while. I don't want to be an outlaw. But there's something I have to do. Years ago, I made a promise to Boss Omaeda. Yakuza are the dregs of humanity, nothing compared to the toiling peasants. We should be of some service to decent folks. But all I saw across the land was a despicable lot unfit to be called yakuza! No good two-facers in cahoots with Hasshu marshals, fattening their own pockets! I killed the sheriff. I'm a condemned criminal. But I just have to keep my promise to Boss Omaeda. I hear he's been ailing from a long illness, and weak, and there's a scumbag out to get him. He's a two-facer like Matsugoro, who did me in and I want to settle it with him before I'm buried. But I don't want to get the Omaeda in trouble... by getting too close. Ask for me at a Sakurabashi inn called "Juji-ya" in Tsubakoi Village, when things have cooled down. Look, boss. Of the 100 and some men who were with you at Mt. Akagi, these few men and I stuck with you. You can't just expect us to leave you. Won't you take some of us with you? Please, boss! Wait. I appreciate your loyalty. But this is no time for bidding sad farewells. We're going to have to fight our way out. I'll hold them back while you flee to the valley, boss. I'll show you all I'm a Kunisada henchman! Tomo! Don't let him get killed! You men do as I told you and go! You go down to the valley, now! Will you make me your henchman, boss? Do I have a choice? Just watch me, boss. Now go! Are you Chuji? You go, Tomokichi. You know where. Go! Firearm! They've got firearm, sir! Let's pull out! - Are they Chuji's men? - Can't tell. It worked. Serves them right! You guys get out of here before you get in trouble. I have to catch up with Boss Chuji. Thanks, and so long! Hey, mister. You owe us. Sorry about that. You did a good job so I owe you plenty. How many of you... six? Here. Split that between yourselves. Thanks, mister! Oh, no. I gave them all my money! They're gone. I gave them my money, too. An incurable fool is what I am. I have to find Boss Chuji! Oww! What a clumsy fool I am! That's what I get for losing an eye. Oww! Where's the boss? I don't know. We all split up. Let's look for him. Boss! Boss! He's eluded us. Where did he sneak off to? Maybe he took off on Shinshu Road. Sir Nakayama figures Chuji's off to see Omaeda. Omaeda Eigoro? Then stake out his place. No problem. Sir Nakayama has all the marshals at his disposal. It's the perfect time to take out Omaeda. Eigoro's ill, and his son Eijiro's gone on a trip. Eijiro? Kotengu Eijiro, a real ruffian. Dad, are you all right? - What's wrong? - He has a stomachache. A stomachache? Here, give him this. Thank you. Bad news! Not so loud! The doctor's seeing him. He needs rest and quiet to get well. Call me if there's any change. Thank you, doctor. Brother. What? - The whole town's buzzing. - About what? Boss Kunisada, who killed the Iwahana sheriff and turned fugitive. And? He managed to elude the posse. The Hasshu marshals figure he'll show up here. What? They've got this place staked out. They know Boss Kunisada and our boss go way back. Our boss could take on any Hasshu marshal, but not in his condition. If only the young boss would come back. But who knows when he'll be back. Hopefully by the casino fest. I'll just have to seek some advice. We're dealing with Hasshu marshals, and with the annual fest coming up, I thought I'd seek some advice from a pro. Come now. I'm not a yakuza anymore. Consider it friendly advice from an old innkeeper. That's fine with me. What would you do, boss? Boss? I mean, tell me what you would do, innkeeper. Well, if I were in your place, I wouldn't tell my ailing boss. You wouldn't, either? What if the Hasshu marshals waylay Boss Kunisada? I wouldn't worry about it. Boss Kunisada won't come near the Omaeda. The Hasshu marshals are wasting their time. Boss Kunisada knows what trouble he'd cause the Omaeda if he were to show up now. The Hasshu marshals and the Omaeda can wait all they want, Kunisada won't show up. I'd be more concerned about... What? It's Chuji's men! After them! Watch it! Can't you see I'm in a rush? Hold it. If you're alarmed by that posse, you must be one of Chuji's men. So what? If they've caught Boss Chuji or his men, I'm going to save them. Save Chuji? Interesting. I'm here to kill Chuji. Kill Boss Chuji? What the hell..?! Who are you? Quiet! I won't let you near Boss Chuji. I'm checking out. Get me my bill. He got away? Sir. - Who was that guy? - That was Kotengu Eijiro. Oh. Turn left up ahead and it's the 5th house. Busy, busy! Here's wash from the Pine Room. A masseuse for the Cedar Room. More rice for the Chrysanthemum Room. Wine for the Clover Room. Pen and Ink for the Plum Room. Get a palanquin for the Bamboo Room. We don't have a Plum Room, San. There's no one in the Bamboo Room. Did I get mixed up? Better go ask again. What's so funny? You think I'm a fool? Don't laugh at me! Not you. You'll only get more confused. Someone else go. The master wants you, San. Right now. The master? You see? The master wants me. Where are you going? He's inside. You called, sir? Will you go on an errand for me? Yes, sir! You'll only get in everyone's way here. Oh, sure. So where to, sir? Edo? Kyoto? Osaka? The South? Much closer. Go get Uranami for me. Uranami? Go get the celebrated Boss Uranami? Stop prattling and go! What do you want with my brother, dear? Don't worry. I just want to talk to him about fishing, over a drink. What can an innkeeper do? The boss stepped out? Where to? To a restaurant, with some important guests. Important guests? Like the shogun? Fool! Hasshu marshal Nakayama and Boss Iioka Sukegoro. Any objections, Kichigoro? It was so unexpected, I don't know how to take it. Just follow orders from the authorities. Sir Nakayama's right. We all went through it. You'll get used to it, and I'll help you. I'd appreciate that, Boss Iioka. Come forward, Kichigoro. Accept the honor. You accepted it, did you? After taking over your turf, I didn't want to become a two-faced lawman. But you couldn't say no? Well, that's that. Ohama, will you give us some privacy? What did you want, brother? I had something to tell you. But now that you're a lawman, I have to think about it. Come on, brother. Ohama is my sister, and I owe you a lot. But what if Kunisada Chuji were to stay here? What would you do, as a man of the law? You can't let him go. Which is why I'm not going to talk about it. I just couldn't say no last night, brother. Not so much for me, as for my dad and his business. Your dad is Ohama's dad. Ohama's dad is my dad. I know how you feel. But you may have to take out the Omaeda one day. Take out the Omaeda? Not me! No, not you, but that truncheon of yours. Just round up some men, any kind of men. Hasshu marshals and local lawmen will take care of the rest. The casino fest's 5 days away. Save up your energy. Come on, girls. Join us. Excuse us, we have to go. Say, how about sharing your dumpling with me? You're a guy! Chew on this sandal! Jerk! What a weird troupe! Gamblers are swarming from everywhere, too. It's going to be one big Omaeda casino fest, and I'm going to pocket a fortune. Not with trick dice, though. They're going to be a tough bunch. Not all of them. Look over there. Hey, you g-g-guys. What are you saying? Don't g-g-get mad. I st-t-tutter when I'm hungry. What are you t-t-trying to say? Just let me eat t-t-those. I feel a little better. Who the hell are you anyway, you freak? Who the hell? Well, I'll tell you who. From the port of Shimizu in Shinshu, I'm one of Boss Jirocho's men, Mori Ishimatsu. You guys don't look like no yakuza to me. So I'll skip the formal introduction. Well, what do you say? He's the real thing. What do you want with us, Boss Ishimatsu? While on the road, did you guys hear anything about Kunisada Chuji? I'm looking for him for Boss Jirocho. Boss Chuji is wanted across the land. You'll never find him. On every road, and at every inn and flophouse, the authorities have their eyes out for him. What do you suggest then? These. Women? Boss Chuji must have had a woman in every town. Look them up. They'll come right out and warm up to you, and you won't be able to shake them off. Sounds like a good idea. So where are these women? We don't know. What?! Well, I guess not. You've no chance to relax now that you're a lawman. I'm so busy. I have to see Hasshu marshal Nakayama today. The Omaeda casino fest's coming up, too. It just won't let up. Hello. Yes? Is the boss here? What do you want, Itaro? Kunisada's men were found on a back road. What?! I'll be back, Otoki. The Kunisada? Run, Tomokichi! You run, brother! Run, Tomokichi! Tomokichi! Brother! You haven't done anything wrong, Tomokichi. I killed Onijizo, got that? Now run! Brother!

He's looking for someone. Who was it? What..? Hey! Search the place! Why are you guys camped out here? Help us, boss. No inn will take us. Why not? No one will accept an endorsement from a local boss. Which boss? Boss Kunisada. Well, no wonder. - I'm back. - Yes, ma'am. A visitor? Yes, a traveler who came to see you. At this hour? We showed him to the Flower Room. Excuse me. Boss Chuji! How long has it been? 5 years now? You look surprised. As you must know, I'm a fugitive. I'm glad to see you. Thanks. Will you do me a favor? Deliver this confidential letter for me to Squire Nizaemon of Kunisada Village in Joshu. What's the matter? One moment. Let me know when the boss gets here. Who is that boss in there? He once saved me from some bad men here. He just stopped by. I'll take that. Welcome. The madam is with a guest. I'll get her. Don't bother. Let her attend to her guest. I hope you don't mind my coming here. Please, boss. I have this place only because you helped me. That was a long time ago. I'm not the man I used to be 5 years ago. Instead of a welcoming party of big bosses, I got a posse waiting for me now. Have one with me. Have you found yourself a good man? Oh, please, boss. I'm not teasing you. I don't want to cause either one of you trouble. Boss... What is it? Forgive me, boss. What happened? Don't ask any questions. Just get out of here. Get out? My man is a lawman. I see. I must have alarmed you, showing up. No, but this lawman is coming here tonight. Thanks for telling me. You don't have to deliver that letter. Give it back to me. No, it's the least I can do for you. I appreciate it. Time to go. Wait. I'll have my maid check outside. You're here. Osaki didn't tell me. Never mind. I'm staying over tonight. What about your guest? He's leaving soon. Who is he? An out-of-towner? Someone I know. Osaki told me he's a yakuza. Who is he? Don't want to tell me? It isn't that. Do you want to break up with me, Otoki? No. He isn't like that. Then tell me who he is. I can't..! Don't tell me it's... Dear! Kunisada! Don't be so hard on your woman. Hey, punk. When did you turn two-faced? Does the Sakurabashi boss, whose turf you got, approve? Seeing you like that, I guess I won't be staying at his inn. Don't you act big and give your sister Ohama grief. Sorry to trouble you, Otoki. Thanks for your hospitality for an old guest. Kichigoro, Otoki is too good for you. Don't you give her any grief, either. I'm just another guest. Let me pay you. Keep the change.

Of course. Last I heard he was holed up on Mt. Akagi. Any word since? Has Eijiro written? No. That vagabond. I hope Kunisada comes by. Chuji plans to leave brother in Boss Omaeda's care. Boss Omaeda's a good man. That's good. Hello! Where's Nizaemon? He's inside. Good to see you both. How is it? I'm much better, thank you. Not you. I meant the fugitive Chuji. How would I know? Wasn't a confidential letter delivered to you? From Chuji? You and Chuji go back a long way. No, we don't. Don't mess with us! Better stop protecting Chuji, or else! Please. My dad is ill. So he is. We'll have to question you instead. What are you doing?! Dad..! Let me go! Dad..! - What are you guys up to? - Who the hell are you?! With Boss Chuji gone, the place is crawling with lousy lawmen. You punk! Who the hell are you? Who the hell? I'm Kotengu Eijiro from Omaeda, Joshu. I'm no hooligan. I was riled at them for driving Boss Chuji out. So you're the young boss Omaeda. My dad sent me off to get some hard knocks. I came back to learn of that fiasco at Mt. Akagi, and was told to find out about Boss Chuji here. Boss Chuji went to your place. We just received his letter. To my place? That's right, it's almost casino fest time. Tonight's the evening fest. The place must be jumping. Thank you for helping us set up a stage.

I've rounded up 40-50 thugs and hooligans. There's going to be a huge crowd at the fest. All they have to do is cause mayhem posing as Chuji's men. We'll blame old man Omaeda for it and throw him in jail, and finish the Omaeda. Miki? Meet Choshi lawman Iioka Sukegoro. I looked around for Chuji, but he isn't showing up. You're looking for him, too, sir? Chuji has a strong sense of duty. He'll show up. Hello! Welcome. I want to see the innkeeper. Get him for me. I'm afraid our master doesn't associate with yakuza. What?! Who the hell do you think I am, you old geezer?! Don't I remember Mori Ishimatsu, you mean? Why, Boss Sakurabashi! That's not me, not as far as my wife is concerned. Oh, that's right. Sorry.

What is that? Since when does the law send me a welcome party? Who are you men? I'm Sasagawa Shigezo, and we're here for the Omaeda casino fest. We're coming through. Sasagawa Shigezo's shown up? Sasagawa Shigezo and Chuji are family. He's here to show support for the Omaeda. Shigezo will make things difficult for us. The Sasagawa were next to go, after the Omaeda. But I could take care of them both at once. Then there will be no one left to defy me. So what now? You challenge Shigezo to a duel, Sukegoro. He isn't one to back down from a challenge. Challenge Shigezo? Kill him at the Tone riverbed tomorrow morning. I'll take care of the rest as Hasshu marshal. Then go to the Hachiman shrine grounds and tear down the Omaeda casinos. I'll arrest Eigoro. But Sasagawa Shigezo brought Tomigoro and his best men with him. He won't go down so easily. Don't worry. Sir Hirate? How about it, Miki? You yakuza take care of your own. I'll take Chuji. Chuji has a strong sense of duty. He'll show up when he finds out Shigezo is taking on Sukegoro. He will, will he? Welcome! Master, Boss Sasagawa is here. He is? The fest tomorrow is going to be something else. Iioka must be here with the Hasshu marshal to break up the fest. Boss Omaeda is old and ailing. The Hasshu marshal is resorting to his usual tactic to take him out. With both the Kunisada and Omaeda bosses out, it'll be doom and gloom for the Hasshu lands. I swear to you, Minosuke, I, Sasagawa Seizo, will see the Omaeda fest through. I'm glad to hear that. You've gone straight. I didn't want to tell you this. But should anything happen to me, will you send word to my people for me? I'll relax tonight. A letter for you, Boss Sasagawa. A letter? It's sealed the wrong way. Never mind, open it. Tomorrow morning at six, at the Tone riverbed. They're bent on keeping me from the fest. Well, good night. What now, dear? You'll have no part of it. You left the yakuza life for me. Don't forget that. Don't leave our guests to the maids, Ohama. Let's go. The Sasagawa group just left. Oh. What's this? A divorce notice. Sakurabashi Minosuke may no longer be a yakuza, but he's still a man. Just divorce me. No, dear! I won't do it! If you insist on it, you kill me right now! Dear..! It's almost time, boss. Be on your guard. Go! Sakurabashi..? Why don't you stop them, Kichigoro? You're a man of the law! It's Chuji! Chuji's here! It's Chuji! Kill him! M-m-mori Ishimatsu, here to assist the Sasagawa! Chuji! A posse's got the Omaeda surrounded! Oh, no! You go to the Omaedas', Sasagawa! Hold it! Kunisada! Why didn't you come by? I was expecting you! I didn't want to give your loving wife grief. I just killed Kichigoro. Kichigoro? Chuji! I've waited for this. You cowards! Stop! Chuji..! Our duel..! This isn't right..! You mangy dogs! Whose hired killers are you? You can't pull that "hand of the law" crap on me. Step up, if you want to try me. Settle down! I am Hasshu marshal Nakayama Seiichiro. I'm placing you all under arrest! Hey! Boss Omaeda is surrounded! Boss! Boss Kunisada! Hey, Hasshu marshal! Here's the payback for the Mt. Akagi fiasco! Abuse your authority to take out the Omaeda, will you?! Boss Omaeda! Dad! Thanks for coming, Kunisada. I'm glad to see you. Pops! On with the Omaeda fest, all of you. This is where you step up and start acting like a young boss, Eijiro. Say hello to your bosses, Tomokichi. This is where you're going to learn your ropes. I'm counting on you, Sakurabashi. I'll watch over the young boss and Tomokichi. I'm glad to hear that. You give my best to your wife. Tell all the bosses the Omaeda casino fest is alive and well. I sure will. Going already, Boss Kunisada? I killed the sheriff, and now the Hasshu marshal. I'll be an aimless wanderer for a while. I forgot to give you Boss Jirocho's message. Let me accompany you back to Shimizu, Boss Chuji. You tell Jirocho for me, I don't want to cause him any more trouble. Take me with you, boss. You can't go alone. I won't be alone. I have Komatsugoro Yoshikane here to keep me company. THE END
