Your mom isn't home? Man, if this was Seoul, we'd eat real food for lunch, and I'm sorry And thank you for taking time off to come here I'll be brief and end this quickly What I've noticed is that the learning environment here is much different from Seoul It's not the school's size or the small number of students Just because it's a rural school, you can't treat it that way So I want to put them in the same learning environment as in Seoul So the first step we must take is the school's lunch program Kids, you better eat everything, okay? - Yes, sir! - Come here Yummy! - You like eating at school? - Yes!

Look at this It rips apart like this and I can't work! I have to go to town to sell this, but he tells me to go later Damn it, why do you have to go to town whenever I use my hose? It's all by coincidence, damn it Listen to me! Listen! So you have to put the hose here to water your crops And you have to pass this way on your tractor - That's the problem, right? - That's right Is everyone happy now? I have to go back to school now Let's go He's smart Mr. Kim is really smart Where did the hose go?

She's good, huh? - An actress? - Yes She can't be an actress with a face like that That's right That's not true These days, it's all about character Anyway, Ae-soon is very energetic - She does have that side in her - That's right! I have a friend who works at a talent agency, you see In other words, they dig out and nurture talent there Choi Jin-shil and Jang Dong-gun came from there Anyone who goes there becomes a star Mr. Kim, you're right, - But we can't afford - Hold on Getting good grades in middle school all depends on how she studies in Seoul during winter break Sir Ma'am But he's only in first grade That's not true at all Throughout the world, to become a gifted artist 90% of his talent is nurtured in childhood By chance If by chance, you don't raise his talent then Sung-man will forever forever live his life hating his parents So-seok!

A janitor shouldn't fall off the roof like that Are you a real janitor? Are you making fun of me? Man, you got hurt pretty bad You can't even wash yourself, so how will you work now? Plus, it's hard to ask for new help Well, the school will be closed down anyway So what will you do for a living later? What does it matter to you? I'm just worried about how you'll make a living The school may go, but the kids won't Even if they go to another school, I'll make it where they can study and play after school I've worked here because I like seeing these kids I'm not like other people who work here for money Come here and sit - What are you doing? - Sit down You have to wash your hair, too Ouch, my head hurts I'm getting drenched Look at this greasy hair I already washed my hair a few days ago Stop lying What is this? Dandruff or rice? 54th Graduation Ceremony We will now begin the 54th and last graduation ceremony We'll now hear a word from the teacher, Mr. Kim Bong-doo I've been a teacher for about ten years It's been short, but the time I've spent here was precious Of course, I had some dull moments I won't take this time to say good-bye I'll just think of it as a brief separation Mr. Kim, Coach Gus Hiddink said the same thing You can't fool us anymore Does it matter whose words I use? Anyway, I'd like to thank you all Especially, these five children I'll never forget them I didn't teach these kids These kids taught me instead I'd like to ask one last favor from you all Even when you become adults, I want you to always hold on to your pure and innocent hearts This school will be gone, but wherever you go, never forget what you've learned here That is all A farewell address The very first time when we met you in school, we were so happy going to school makes our hearts leap up and we would run to get to school with joy It seems like last forever But today we have to face with the graduation of you and the last day of our school We cannot go to our school from tomorrow on But we will never, ever forget this warm and pleasant place which is filled with our laughter An address in reply I'd walk to our school even before I entered And today is the saddest day cause it"s the last school day for us all Theres a lot of ups and downs but you guys always gave me smile Mr. Kim taught us with love I'd never forget any minute of the precious memories of us all But I can hardly keep my tears from falling Just like our school bound us together Let's keep our school with our hearts forever Farewell my dear school yard! To my sister for her graduation I give you a bundle of flowers I will study the books you gave me And study hard like you Farewell my beloved juniors and classrooms And farewell my teacher Study hard and grow older So we can be our country's bright future Mister Kim Yes Here you go What's this? It's a small token of our gratitude to you Please, you don't have to do this - No, please take it - There's no need Wait a minute!! Are you that dumb? The school will be gone, so this isn't any bribery It's different from the envelopes you used to take So hurry and take it Hurry! Mister Kim Yes?
