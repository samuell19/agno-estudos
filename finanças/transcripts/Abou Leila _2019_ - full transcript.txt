Now the sneaking serpent walks in mild humility, And the just man rages in the wilds where lions roam. William Blake - What now? - Where are you going? To the office. You said you'd stay home. - It's an emergency, a client's waiting. - You can work from here. Look, it's an important case. I have to see my client. - Do it over the phone. - No, I can't on the phone. - I have to see him. - No, you promised. I'll be done by noon. All right? Look! Before noon. All right? I won't be long. I have to go, OK? - Go back in, please. - No, stay! See you later, OK? Algeria, 1994 Fill her up. - Is there a tap here? - Over there. Who's speaking? It's March 31st 1994. Good morning, everyone. The latest news. There have been more suspicious disappearances. Prices continue to rise across the country... ...new skirmishes between army forces and an unidentified terrorist group in the Koléa region, near Algiers... It's the third attack of its kind since... No one has yet claimed responsibility... The president expressed his condolences... A room, please. - One or two? - One room with two beds. And our friend's? His ID? The shower. Water's in short supply these days. Don't squander it. Once it's all gone, it's gone. Don't come complaining to me. OK, bro? Are you awake? I don't feel good. Don't worry. It's just a fever. So? - Are we there? - Don't worry. Try to rest a bit. Take this. I'm sick of that shit. It's a sleeping pill, it won't knock you flat like the other. We agreed, right? - The guy downstairs... - What about him? - You should show him the photo. - What photo? In my jacket. Where did you get this? I'm counting on you tonight. - Don't worry. - Help me out. Don't worry, they're not going to win. 21. And many casualties at Algiers airport. Quiet, quiet! Since that time, numerous terrorist groups have been hiding in the mountains and other regions of the country, with the police paying a heavy price in the fight against terror. Good God, are they still showing that footage? That's from two years ago, unless I'm mistaken. A year, maybe two... I don't know. I was with my son the other day. I sent him to bed so he wouldn't see the news. They show such horrible things. Shut up and play. I've stopped watching TV. Except during Ramadan, for the films and soaps. They're great at censoring any tits. But chopped-up bodies and corpses don't bother them. You'd like some chopped-up tits, eh? Who wouldn't? - You want one? - Yeah. I'll give you two. Who cares about those guys? They deserve what they get. What have I told you about northerners? Those people are sick, they're out of control. - Who created these terrorists? - I dunno. You don't know? They did. Those guys who showed up here earlier... I have no doubt at all that they're... Do you have a phone? - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - No. Behind the bar. Another hand. Kamel. What's the matter, brother? What is it? It's me, it's me! It's me, Lotfi! What's got into you? Breathe, breathe! Breathe with me. Calm down. Breathe. Gently. With me, with me. OK, it's all over now. It's all over. Was it a nightmare? Hand me the water. Gently. Any smokes left? I'd forgotten how your voice sounds. Well? Are you ok? Those fucking drugs... have fried my brain. You have to keep taking them. I'm sick of them. You see what I'm like? A zombie. Is it much further? We'll be there tomorrow night. Can you keep going? There's still time. We can still go back to Algiers and sort everything out. Don't give me that look. I'm worried about you. If you've changed your mind, just say so. You scared me last night. It won't happen again. Insha'Allah ... Nothing works in this shit country. I'm sick of listening tochaabi, anyway. Maybe they'll talk about him. Relax. Enjoy the view. You don't see it every day. I want to see him brought down first. It took us two days once to get two of them out of an apartment. And we didn't take them alive. Those guys don't surrender. Are you testing me? You think I've got nothing better to do? You're trying to make me pull out. Don't be so paranoid. I'm just doing what I always do. We do our best. After that... Are we lost? There's only one road. Keep going, then. I hate driving at night. I'm not charging right in. I want to know how far the next town is. But the scale isn't clear. You're going to become a man today. If you can bear the sight of blood without flinching, that means you're no longer a child. Didn't they teach you this at school? Our prophet Abraham was faltering. That's why God wanted to make a man of him. As simple as that. Keep your eye on it. I'll fetch the knife. You let it go? You let it go! I told you to watch it and you let it go! You wouldn't have done that if you knew what it had cost! Do you want to make me a laughing stock? You're a good-for-nothing! You'll never grow up to be a man! You've stopped me doing my duty. You'll pay for that! If God doesn't get his sacrifice, his wrath will fall on us! So now it's you... You're going to replace the sheep. Come here. Get up, come here! Don't be scared. Don't be scared. What? What is it? I fell asleep. Night's falling. Shouldn't we get moving? What's got into you? We slept in the car, it's dawn. Don't you remember? We were lost, I suggested sleeping here. You fell straight asleep. Have you forgotten? What if I have? Why are you talking to me like I'm an idiot? Anyway... we can't hang around here. What's that? You're not stopping? - Stop. - Wait... There's a car behind us, that'll stop. - You're abandoning them? - Calm down. I'm getting out. Don't start! We're not even meant to be here. Leave me alone! You don't decide for me. - I'm getting out! - Close that door! I'm getting out! You wanna get out? Go on, then! Child! I couldn't care less! Bastard! Fucking pain! Amine, sweetheart... It was his fault, he was driving too fast. Hang on. - I couldn't do anything. - Help me, please. Get him out! Pull! Be careful with his hand! Amine! Come on, sweetie! Wake up. God, his head! Talk to Mummy. Come on, let's go. It was his fault, driving too fast. His fault, I swear. What's got into you? What are you doing? Take care of them. Call an ambulance. Call it! I'm pressing charges. He hit me for no reason. Go on, get back in your truck. Hey, you two! Where are you going? Come here. Of course you should send the ambulance! It's 30 kilometres, as you well know. Tell them to get a move on. No tea breaks! Show me your ID. Here. - Where have you come from? - Algiers. A drive in the desert. Playing the tourist? And you bro's ID? This card's been in the wars! It's no excuse, but we've been driving all night and he hasn't slept. Don't try it on. I'm not some rent-a-cop. If you prefer we'll go to the station and I'll put my uniform on so you'll take me seriously. No need. - Is that your car? - Yeah. Well, a friend's. - Do you have the papers for it? - Of course. Or did I leave them in the... No, here they are. There you go. Where do you live in Algiers? On the outskirts, but I grew up in Bab El Oued. Do you know it? Who doesn't know Bab El Oued? - Does he live there too? - Yeah. He's like my brother. I had an aunt who lived there. We used to visit her when I was little. Great times! Before all those roadblocks. Well, from what I hear. That's what it's like. But we've got used to it. - That's no way to live, though! - What can you do about it? What's your aunt's name? I might know her. Let me explain something, bro. Every day I pick up dead bodies here. Boy racers, people crying, bodies in pieces... In a thousand years of terrorism you won't see so much death. So you can live in Bab El Oued or Pigalle if you like. I don't care about your life. Don't try it on! - You, get in. - Wait... One more word and you'll join him. Get in. Can we talk? - Talk all you like. - In private. I have to explain. Two minutes. And he doesn't move. Do you smoke? Get out. Splash some water on his face and hurry to the next town. I didn't understand your story. I'll let all the squads know. Your next fuck-up, it's prison. - Thanks. - Get outta here! - Chief! - What? The kid. - What? - He's dead. Lucky him. What did you tell him? What's happening to me? I don't understand. Lotfi? Brother... Lotfi? Where the fuck are you? I'm OK, don't worry. I shouldn't worry? Are you taking the piss? Just tell me where you are, please. Heading south. In the desert with that maniac? Have you gone mad? It was the only way to calm him. He'd have fucked up if left alone. He's already screwed up. His place is in a nuthouse, not in the desert. You didn't see where he was. With all the nutcases. The place stank of shit, Kamel. You're making a big mistake, bro. The lead he got is false. You're compounding his madness. That's bad. I know the lead is false. I don't care about the fucking lead. No one believed your bro. Neither did you. There's never been any terrorists in the desert. Abou Leila or anyone. I'm not a kid, Kamel. I know what I'm doing. Don't you realise your friend is crazy, aggressive, capable of anything? We're all crazy. This entire country's fucked. I don't understand any of this. I no longer recognise you. - Can you hear me? - Yes, I can hear you. But I have to go. Wait, I haven't finished. - Come to your senses, I beg of you. - Take care, Kamel. I'll find some place to sleep and get some food. No. You stay here. This is the arsehole of the world! I don't even know this place's name. All because some guy gave you a shit lead. What did I tell you when we got out of Algiers? That we do things my way, the way I decide! You wanted everyone to believe you? But you're screwing up. Come back down to earth, for God's sake! The bag. Is there a café here? Hello. The toilet? Open the door! Come on, open the door! Open the door! - Why did you lock yourself in? - Who are these people? You really have a problem with people, don't you? - You think you're better than them? - Are you still mad at me? I asked them to come so you wouldn't play that trick on me again. - I don't understand. - Well, I do. I thought it over and I understand. You're in cahoots with that fucker Abou Leila. You're his bitch, right? And you brought me so I'd fall into his trap. - True or not? - No. Lotfi! Stop them! Brother, please! Lotfi! I'm begging you, Lotfi! Stop them! Stop them, brother! I've given you everything! I've put my career on the line for you, my family, my life! I didn't expect that from you. I haven't done anything, believe me! When you were freaking out, I stuck up for you. They said: "The guy's crazy!" I said: "What do you mean, crazy? I know him well. "We grew up together, he's my brother, he's not crazy." I ended up a clown because of you! I apologised! What's this? Who did this? Who did this? Did you do it? You did it! No one touches my gun! No one puts his fucking hands on my gun! Brother! Lotfi! There's no Lotfi, no brother, no bro, nothing! Only bitches like you who have to be exterminated! Get in there! Sit down! You're here to die. And I'm here to kill you. Close your eyes. Close them. Don't be scared, I'm here. Don't be scared. It's over. It's over, brother. I love you, I love you very much. I love you very much. A coffee, please. A problem? Have I taken your fancy, chief? Pay no attention. He's crazy. His brother gave him that uniform. Wearing it calms him down. He's harmless. Tell me... are you with the girl? - The white girl with short hair. - No. Sorry if I'm bothering you. We don't get many people from the capital here. - We're curious. You don't mind? - No. I would be too, if I were you. Can I find a bed anywhere? There's no five-star hotel. But there's a dormitory on the edge of town. An old woman runs it. OK, thanks. So you're a policeman? Why? Do I look like one? Even if you were, you wouldn't say. We know how it goes. Anyway. They were right to send you about the kids. I swear. The local cops are hopeless. I'm not a cop. And I don't know what you're on about. The young woman took the photo. No offence, friend, but I just want a quiet coffee. Unexplained crime in Issaouane: 3 children killed It was three or four days ago. They were found torn to pieces. You're used to it in the capital. But it's a big deal here. You know who did it? You're the cop. I told you I'm not a cop. Anyway. Some think a madman killed them. Others say it was the leopard of the desert. - The leopard of the desert? - I know, it's bullshit. So where's this girl? Two days ago she went back to that village. And this guy? Have you seen him? It's odd, but imagine no beard. You're the one who's odd. I knew you were a cop. Abou Leila. Abou... Leila. Give it back, son. Excuse me. What's wrong? Get up. Get up. He's with me. It's OK, nothing serious. Thanks very much, thanks. What is it? Stomach-ache? We're at the car now. It's OK, it's over. Watch your leg. Was I dreaming again? Sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to shout at you. Don't worry about it. I know you don't believe me. I just lost my temper. You know me. Exactly. Stop pretending. I know you want to help me. But I'm not going back. When I think back... I want to sob like a child. Know what we'll do? Tomorrow we'll get up early and drive to Tifernine. If we find him, good. If we don't, we'll go back to Algiers and you can start again. OK? But I need to be sure. Tell me again what he said. I've already told you. Are you sure of the village? Tifernine? It wouldn't be... Issaouane? It's not Issaouane? - Why are you asking? - You really laid into him. Maybe he was lying. To protect his brother. Maybe he just said a name at random to make you stop. He said Tifernine. I'm sure of it. We'll find a spot for the night, yeah? I live in the house next door. If you need anything, just knock. Feel free. After you. It's not luxurious, but the mattresses are comfortable. You have a TV, a closet... The aircon doesn't work, but there's a window. - Be quiet or I'll cut your throat! - Don't talk to him like that! Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Are you asleep? Still not. Lotfi. I meant it, I'm not going back. I know what's been said. But there's one thing that won't change. If we find him... I'll kill him. You have to let me. Why does he obsess you? Do what you want to him. I don't want to go back either. Lotfi... Lotfi, he's here. Lotfi! - They killed them. - Who? What's going on? We don't really know. I think there's been a massacre. Don't worry. Wahab, stay here. Hichem, come with me. Stay back, we're sealing the area. What are you doing? Get out of there! Stop! Maybe he's the one we're looking for. If he'd been at Issaouane... we'd have been onto him. What? On his trail. We've been going in circles for 4 days. Maybe we missed him. Look at the state of him. He looks crazy. We should hand him to the gendarmes. What did he say? I don't know what he's done, but he's not the one. - Can't you speak Arabic? - We have to be careful. Don't you think? I've seen him before. We'll know more when he wakes up. Shall we tie him up? The rope's there, if you want. I'll hang myself with your fucking rope! So you understand Arabic now? Maybe I'm the one who's crazy. What am I doing here? - Aren't you photographing the desert? - Yes, the desert, not blood. - What did she say? - She's complaining. If he attacks us, don't wake me up. I'm exhausted. Is your leg better? Here. You have to drink. How did you end up here? Lost your way? Did you come alone? Are you looking for him? A week ago our village was attacked. Three kids were killed. If you know anything, tell me. My friends are afraid of you. We want to be sure we can trust you. We're going home tomorrow. You can come with us. But you don't have to. You're free to choose your death here. What the hell are they up to? Where did you put them? Where did you put them? Where did you put them? They're recent, aren't they? Jackal prints. Or a wolf, maybe. The same as by the village? No. These look smaller. I don't know what we're looking for. Something bigger than a jackal. And more... More...? Maybe the Algiers guy knows something. Do you think he was involved? Remember Uncle Halim? Mum told me about him. Possessed by some sort of djinn. During the war, wasn't it? He has the same look in his eyes as Uncle Halim. One last story and then you go to sleep. All right? Yes, Mummy. A wise old man once told of the different transformations that the human soul undergoes. How it becomes a camel, then a lion and, finally, a child. Because of its hunger and the illusion of its own grandeur, the soul wants to bear the greatest burden, so it kneels like a camel and waits to be weighed down with its load. It wishes its suffering to be equal to its feeling of power. For some, the greatest burden is to be humiliated so that their pride suffers. Or the greatest burden may be to climb to the top of a mountain and give everything up at the very moment of victory. For others, the truest burden is to reject consolation when they are sick. But in this desert of loneliness the soul is transformed a second time, becoming a lion. The lion wants to win its freedom and reign over its own desert. It destroys all in its path to become its own master. Finally, the lion becomes a child. It rediscovers its innocence and can begin again. He is the first movement and the sacred fire. It is he who destroys the whole world to construct a new one in his image. I'll bring him back. We mustn't split up. He can't be far away. She's right, brother. Stay with us. It'll be light in two hours. We have to leave early. Look after her. If I'm not back in two hours, go without me. I trust you. You're no longer a child. Abdelkrim, this is madness. It's not worth it. Don't you ever listen? Fucking pride! And you'll let him go? Hey! Handsome. Did you sleep well? I really went mad. Look at that. I could load twenty or more with my eyes closed. We've all gone mad. All of us! You too... could have learnt to do it, if you'd applied yourself. I don't know why. I feel I've messed everything up. I've screwed up, right? I won't lie to you. Butchering that family, I didn't see that coming. In 7 years of service, I'd never seen that. I don't remember anything. Just as well. Believe me. What can you hear? Nothing. Calm. Why go back to hell? You can rest here. I remembered a story my mother told me at bedtime. Leave your mother out of it. Get yourself a real woman. Between us, there are things your mother can't do to you. I wanted to tell her... Why would the lion turn into a child, if he's the only one to do so? You listen to your sensitive side too much. If you're not a lion among lions, you'll get eaten. I'd have given anything to have your courage. Alas, that's not the case. The bastard could shoot you. We can't stay here. - Here. - No. Fucking take it! Put this on! - Put what on? - And follow me! On the floor! - What are you doing here? - You told me to come. Not now. What did they do? Why? Are you their lawyer? Get outta here! Squad, move! Section four, on the move. Stop following me! Boumaaza! I'm talking to you! What are you doing? You're starting to piss me off! We're not playing games! Get in! What's he doing? Get in, I said! Never do that to me again, OK? Park there. I'll be back in a minute. Pay no attention to him. He's stressed, like everyone. It doesn't matter. I know. By the way... how's your mother? Not so bad. She's a bit tired at the moment. My mother's sick too. It's tough watching them grow old. You're right. Thanks for asking. It's normal, brother. We're in the same shit. I know the chief makes your life a misery. But... you know what? He likes you. I don't think so. We all like you. Wake up. I heard a gunshot. Your brother hasn't come back. Move. Move! Take a left. - This one? - Yes. Go back! What are you waiting for? There he is! Stop! - Cover me! - Rachid... - What is it? - It won't... Get your head down! - Don't move! - It won't! I'm getting out. Careful! I'm getting out. Shit! Rachid... Rachid! Is it a dream? Is it a dream? Gently, gently. Breathe, breathe. Mohamed! Breathe. Mohamed! Breathe. Mohamed! Can I record this? Do what you like. Name, age and profession? Lotfi Bedia. 37. Policeman. What service? The ONRB. Anti-terrorism. Did you work together? No, he was just a normal cop. Traffic duty. He couldn't work with us. Why? He didn't have what it takes. Not a good enough shot, not sociable enough. Why did you help him join the police? I've always thought of him as my brother. We'd lost contact. I just wanted to help him. You fixed things so he'd pass the psychological assessment? That's serious, you know? Your entire story is complicated. You sit there... with no idea of the shit we're facing in the north. Yeah... so it seems. I phoned your friend Kamel, as you asked. He told me about his brush with Hamza Bourab, also known as "Abou Leila". Is that right? But I don't understand why that incident made him go insane. Was the policeman who was killed his friend? Guys like him shouldn't have to go through that. Evil tongues have it that the country is one big lunatic asylum. I don't agree. I think there are the guilty and there are the innocent. And it turns out... your friend wasn't innocent. As simple as that. I say... that all of this is the fault of guys like me. Guys who think they're invincible. Who leave others by the side of the road. Guys who think that everyone is able to bear what they can bear. One day you'll wake up and the war will be over. But you'll still have one foot in it. I hope you'll have the courage, even just the once, to chop off that foot before you start another war. ABOU LEILA
