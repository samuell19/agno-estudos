"Battles Without Honor And Humanity" Directed by Kinji Fukasasu Kure City, Hiroshima, 1946 A year after Japan's surrender... Though the war is gone, a new type of violence emerged in this land of disorder. People had to depend on themselves to face against this lawless society. Help! Somebody helps me! Shozo Hirono Shinichi Yamagata Bastard, what are you doing? Hold it... They're from American G.I.S. Bullying women! They should not be spared Run quickly. The military police is coming. Toru Ueda Ueda How dare you! Seiji Doi The head of Doi's gang How dare you mess around here? This is the territory of our Doi gang. Hiroshi Wakasugi The successor of Doi's gang Bring him away. Don't try to scare me. What do you want? Wakasugi, do it. Take it. The right hand for this one. Please spare me. Come... Whoever has money will get the food. I've been lining up for hours. Shuji Yano Prime member of Yamamori's gang What's the hurry? Boss, the money... Seikichi Makihara Prime member of Yamamori's gang Put them inside. Look! I've the rice here. Let's have a good meal. Stupid! How could you throw everything inside? Makihara, take it. Muneichi Shinkai Prime member of Neo Yamamori's gang Seiichi Kambara Prime member of Neo Yamamori's gang Tetsuya Sasaki Prime member of Neo Yamamori's gang Stop listen to this. It's dated. It's my favorite. Damn it! Too dangerous here. Let's go. Boss, someone is making trouble. What happened, Yamagata? Got sheared. Who did it? I'd a fight with a underworld member in the black market. I tried to stop him from entering it. He sheared me suddenly. I didn't even have time to take care of others. I left, saying that there're brothers in our Yamamori gang. We'll be back for revenge. I got it. Pull yourself together. Where did the fight start? Lt'd be in the black market ahead. Spilt up and get there separately. How dare he show off all by himself! I'd like to see how he could shear us on the street. Bastard! Wait a minute. Don't leave me alone. I want to go too. Be careful. Don't worry. Wait. What happened again? What the hell is it? Seiji and Nobu fell into the mud pit. Go Fine? How could you be like this? No problem. I found out that Nobu and him fell into here. Look like they'd a fight and lost. This is where they could get away. Look like the enemy is a wealthy merchant. I don't care if he's wealthy. How could he just mess around? Look like he's all by himself. We didn't know him. We'd better ask for the help of our friends in the black market. Okay. No need. I'll go by myself. The sheared one is my friend. It's a shame to ask for help from too many people. Are you armed? No. Get one when we're there. Do you know where he's? He'd be in the black market there. You'd better take this. Maybe it could be of some help. Come again? Who are you from? I won't be nice to you. I killed him. Run now! Hey... Pray... Where are you going? Shut up! I need to see the warden. Go back to your seat. What the hell! Why isn't there rice? We'd have been given rice as well. If you're satisfied, don't eat it. You don't give us rice. You've stolen the rice. Give the rice back to me. Bastard! People leaving the seat won't have meals for 3 days. What's your sentence? 12 years imprisonment. You can be free on bail with money. On bail with enough money. Every prison now is overcrowded. You need 50,000 dollars for a 12-year term. How could I have such a lot of money? I'll commit seppuku later. I need your help. Why do you do that? We don't have a qualified doctor here. Any sick or injured people can be on bail immediately. Killing myself here will create chaos. If I cut myself too deep, they'd just kill me straight away. I count on you. Leave it to me. It's a fate to know you. I'm the young master of Doi gang. I'm Hiroshi Wakasugi. I heard of your name before. But I'm not an underworld member. No one born to be an underworld member. Do you want to join my gang? It's strange for me to turn over a new leaf. I'm Shozo Hirono. We don't have a cup here. Let's cut our arms and vow with the blood. If I leave here earlier, I'll raise money to bail you out. Then I count on you. Okay? May I call someone now? You may... Guard, suicide... Someone commits suicide. Guard, hurry up. He'll die. He's out. Congratulation. Congratulation. Shozo, Thanks for coming. It's good to see you fine. Mr. Yamamori who provided the bail is here to see you too. Yoshio Yamamori Sir, he's Hirono. Sorry to borrow money from you. I'll pay you back as soon as possible. Forget it. You're in the prison because you fought for my men. If Mr. Toi didn't tell me the truth, I wouldn't know anything at all. Right. Hiroshi always boasted your help in the prison. He's staying in the hospital. He asked me to send you the gift. It's nothing. Shozo, you've such a great honor that Mr. Yamamori comes to receive you in person. Let's go. Yamamori Gang was established this year. The young ones pledged loyalty, taking over wine cups from Yamamori. The ceremony is simplified to suit the unstable times. You'll be supporting each others from now on. Seiji Doi, the head of Doi gang bore witness. Kenichi Okubo, an elder of the underworld was the host. Let's have a toast. Cheers. Please bet! No more bet. The result is... 1949 The result is... 3 points. What the hell! Know nothing about gambling. The banker is a black market trader of the wartime. It's too wicked. What are you doing? Bastard! Stop! We're friends. We shouldn't fight each others. Let's drink and settle it. Is it horse's urine? Don't you know we drink cold beer? Bastard! So what if it's horse's urine? You're qualified for horse's urine only. I want you to try this. Get lost. Stop... Welcome back. How's it going? The trouble becomes bigger. Ueda wasn't the man he should mess with. That punk is a distant relative of our boss, Okubo. If Ueda was alone, it'd be a lot easier. But there're a few friends of him there. If Okubo wants someone to be punished and threatened to break up our link, what would we do? Could we compensate with money? You don't know the situation. Do you think money can settle everything? I'll cut my finger then. I've nothing to say. Okay. Cut it then. At least it's more sensible than using money. Don't blame me for not being merciless. If Okubo doesn't spare us, he won't let us live peacefully. The old man has many business to take care. He's different from us. Are you really going to cut the finger? Yes. If not, we'll be living a shackled life. I'm a man of my words. But I don't know how to cut it apart. Does anyone know? I can let you know how to cut a finger. I saw a couple of times when I was living with my husband in Osaka. Hey, not the front. Turn it over. Is it okay? Right. Lift your body more. Push all the way down. Shit. It's killing me. Take him to hospital now. Strange. The finger is missing. What? Wouldn't it fall into the garden? Lt'll be a waste if we couldn't find it. Come on. Look for it. Weird. Where's it? I got it. Where? You're really looking for trouble. It'll be a lot of trouble without you. Oh, forget it. Why should we do this for such a small thing? Yamamori, why did you let your brothers do this? Troubles between young men, it's hard to tell who is right or wrong. Besides, this matter Ueda had done more wrong things. Then let's have the matter settled like this. I feel easier listening to your words. Well... The young man has lost his finger. This little money is my respect your lost finger. Bury it nicely. How could I accept this? After this lesson, this guy has learnt something. We count on your future support. Please teach them to become a real man. Anything I can help, please let me know. Uncle. Please kindly instruct me in the future. Actually Ueda isn't that scary at all. Am I right? Mr. Yamamori. You come at the right time. I've someone to introduce to you. Do you have time now? My pleasure. He's congressman Mr. Nakahara. Shigeto Nakahara I heard that in this city 50 billion yens worth of navy military materials. Was remained. We want to use it to re-construct this city. But the Syoichi's gang go against me all the ways. They've a good excuse. Actually they use the money to finance the underworld congressman lkeshima. Syoichi Kanamaru No candidate is having a leading role in the election of congress chairman. I need your help for one thing. What do you want? He asked me for a favor. He wants one less vote for Kanamaru's group. How did you answer him? Okubo told to me on his behalf. How could I refuse him? Ueda said he'd help on this matter too. Sir. Kanamaru is a local as well. He's supported by Doi from behind. Doi had conflict with Ueda before. If we get involved and becomes hostile to Doi, what should we do? Sir. I'm afraid Okubo was behind all these from the very beginning. Ueda's participation is probably because of Doi. If Kanamaru wins, the influence of Doi will become greater. I'll not jump into the trap whose position is known to me. As you said, we'll stand against Okubo. If from the very beginning, we listen to whatever Okubo says, we'll end up with nothing finally. Tetsuya, Shozo... you should be considerate of my position. Besides, Mr. Nakahara agreed to warrant me a loan from the bank which is free of interest and payment period. It'll help greatly to build up our business. The future of the underworld who has the strongest financial background will dominate. This is an opportunity for us. If Doi isn't aware of it, it'll be fine. Please help me this time. I really appreciate it. Tetsuya, I decide to act according to the old man's request. Aren't Wakasugi of Doi and you sworn brothers? Leave the matter to me. Keep your month shut. Damn it. That's it. I'll serve you later on. Tomorrow is the critical moment. Dear... Cheating! No voting. Stop. Everything goes smooth. The result is out. It's all right. Take the stuff back. Listen! I'm Tetsuya Sasaki of Yamamori's gang. I dare to read out my name and let you leave here fine. Behave yourself after you've left here. I'm leaving for a trip. If he dare to tell Doi, I'll pay him a visit soon. 50 billion yens. We've the matter settled. The aldermen there were really pissed off. Seiichi, how come you're here? How are you? May I seat down? Please... Seiichi, may I ask you something about the 50 billion yens? Did Yamamori pull the wire from behind? Please come in. They're expecting you. Thank you. Close the door properly. What's the matter? Something is wrong. Kambara has confessed everything. I shouldn't have come here to pass the words. But Shozo, you're my dear sworn brother. I'm sorry, brother. Thanks for telling me this. Ken, I hope you'll tell Doi Okubo asked for my help. I couldn't return a revenge to my debtor. The old man will listen to what I say. Yamamori, I need to see the boss Kaito in Hiroshima and tell him what was going on. I ask him serving as an arbiter. You'd better hide away for a while. I don't want a duel between us. I understand. Shozo, you must stop the guys from making troubles. I got it. Brother, I count on you. What happened was happened. Who? I'm Kambara. Excuse me. Can I borrow the phone? Bastard, let him in. Wakasugi, what are you doing here? Sir, I... Shut up. Yamamori, how dare you betray me? What are you doing? Calm down. Which side are you on? Yamamori has explained clearly. Bastard, we don't need his explanation. I must kill him today. Sir... We shouldn't fighting each from inside. If we're manipulated by the congressman, we're just like their dogs. Do you want to be expelled from the group? Sir, no matter what you said, I won't let you kill him, unless I die first. I'll kill anyone who wants to make a move. Ken, remember. Kambara, you bastard. Stop. Let him go. Sorry. I know finally what kind of man you're. Ken, no matter what you wants, I'll support you completely. I won't regret. Because of this, Wakasugi became a good friend of Yamamori's gang. But the rival between Yamamori's and Doi's gangs hasn't finished yet. 6 months later, Hirono, who is hiding in Kaito's gang in Hiroshima go the news. Shozo, you've a visitor. Really? Take my place. Okay. Brother. How come you're here? I need to talk to you. I think you couldn't be here any longer. What happened? Doi... will have their business developed here. He'll come to see Kaito soon. What is Doi going to do? Kambara double-crossed us, trying to ruin us. Really? It's not an easy thing to handle. I can't explain it in a while. You'd better not stay here any longer. Brother. You want to go against Doi? My position is embarrassing. You don't have to feel embarrassing. We could just forget our relationship. After all, he's your boss. You couldn't go against him or you'll be laughed by the others. As a whole, you can't stand for me. Just come with me. Talk to the old man and other members to see what we can do. Sir, the situation becomes worse. Should I take action now? Calm down, everyone. If Doi notices this, it'll be shit. I've talked to Wakasugi. What he said is true. I just mind my own business. Just don't know why Doi has to mess with me and ask for troubles. It's really thrilling me. I can't sleep because of this. Today my boss comes to inform you in person. Don't you feel flattered? I'm just too glad. But what should I do? I couldn't have our business affected. I tried hard to build it up. Sir, we're in a position that we shouldn't mind the business anymore. We need to deal with it or we'll be finished. Shozo. You need to think carefully. What the old man is worrying is right. If we take on them, we can't stay in Hiroshima anymore. Six of us here will be dealt with Doi's gang. What's your comment? I agreed to take revenge. But my body isn't in good condition. It couldn't be any help. We better think of something else. Do you have any idea? Hey, what about you? Masakichi What? I don't fear of dying. But my wife is pregnant. Whenever I think of her future, I feel bad and pitiful for her. Got it. I think you won't go as well. Go home and sleep with your wife in your arms. Sir, excuse me. Bastard. All of you has no ball. Forget it. I'll go to kill Doi myself. If Doi is dead, things will be fine. Dear... It's easy to break up the group. If I die, you may do whatever you want. Dear... Sir... why just because of Doi, is our unity dispersed? Okay. I feel a bit sorry for Brother Kaito. But I decide to do it. Shozo Brother It's sorry to see conflict between brothers. Please be considerate. Shozo, the police will arrest you because of this. Maybe you'll have a sentence of death. You're right. Tetsuya doesn't come. How could you deal with Doi by yourself? Leave it to me. I'm not scared of death sentence. I'm prepared for doing this. Shozo, I won't forget your favor for the rest of my life. Sir, you give me a chance to a real man. Don't say that. If you've a life sentence or a sentence over 20 years, I'll offer you all my property when you're out. I'll try hard to make money. Just take that I'm making money for you. Right. Shozo, we've no kids. He always talk about you. If something wrong happens to you, I'll go to collect your body. Shozo, this is what we have. Enjoy yourself and have a good time. Sir, no need. No problem. You're doing it for me. You may do whatever you want. Sorry. It's time to leave. Shozo. It's lucky for us to have you. Shit. It hurts. Lighter please. I don't have a future. 16th October, 1949 Hirono, why do you look strange? I just feel dazzled. I'll have a walk outside. Not the 2nd floor. Guests will be there soon. Who's the next? I'm. Sorry. Please come in. I'm Doi. Is Kaito here? Yes. Please come in. Are you Hirono? You're here too. Thanks. Please come again. Kaito, thanks for your help. Hirono, hold it. Don't stop me. Hirono, hold it. You're really good. Uncle. Hirono. Uncle. Get a doctor quick! Hello, brother? I'm in the hideaway your wife arranged for me. How's Doi? He's sent to Hiroshima Hospital. I heard that he's still alive. I want to see him. But he's guarded by the police. The Doi's gang said they'll take revenge on Yamamori. I'm worrying about them. Don't worry. Doi's gang doesn't know your hideaway. Be patient. I'll come to get you. Got it. Goodbye. Kambara, is it you? Mr. Yamamori just called me, asking me to receive you with a car. You want to settle you in a safe place. Where's the old man? The police is watching him. The Kaito's gang of Hiroshima has made a comprehensive plan to catch you. The Doi's gang is working hard too. Do you think the Doi's gang wouldn't suspect me? What? Have doubt on me? If Yamamori didn't ask me to come, how could I know you're hiding here? If you don't trust me, I'll leave now. Wait for me. I tidy up an will be back soon. What's the matter? The engine is broken. I've a check on the engine. Wait. Kambara... If someone is abandoned by everyone, the only way of living is going back to the prison. Doi is dead. The future will be our Yamamori's. Tetsuya Sasaki is back too. My work is over for the time being. Sorry. I need too leave Yamamori's gang. Brother... It's you who helped Yamamori's. Sasaki is back, but what's the point? You may keep on your work. No. The people around Yamamori have been cautious about me. In addition, last time Kambara picking you up... I felt very disappointed about Yamamori. He's a horrible man. It's time. Take care. Brother, I'll follow after I'm out. Don't refuse me again. Aunt, what do you want from you? I need to talk to you. Wakasugi, what's the matter? Very sorry. I'm going on a long trip. I don't want anyone know. So I need you. How's the Doi's gang now? The young members are good. They also care about how you're doing. I'm glad to hear it. What will happen if I don't let you go? Night 17th December 1949. Seiichi Kambara Died. Captain, someone threw this into the station. This is a map of the town. No. 26, 1-chome... what does it mean? The investigation shows this is where Wakasugi's mistress lives. He must be hiding there. Go now. It fits you fine. From behind, you look like my brother who died in the war. Does it surprise you? No one will recognize you. You've been taking care of my daughter. Mom, don't bother to say this. Tomorrow, early in the morning, We're taking the first train to Osaka. Remember to wake me up. Okay. What's the matter? Don't worry. Go to your bed now. Over there. Quickly. Sister, what happened? Be good and go to bed. Is it the house of Kunihiro? Yes. Please wait. Who are you? Did Wakasugi came by. This is the warrant. I don't know any Wakasugi. Come on. Isn't he your lover? We need to have a check. This is the room of the kid. Don't wake them up. Wakasugi... Wakasugi... Bastard! On 17th December 1946, Hiroshi Wakasugi died. The Korean War broke out. The Korean War broke out in 1950. Yamamori's gang had a contract for American armory. It grew rapidly. On the other hand, the relationship between the members became chaotic. They also participated in the trading of heroine. Search the Yamamori's gang. Give it to me. This is mine. What are you doing? Got it. Toshi, didn't I tell you not to touch this again? You're just annoying. Toshi Arita New member It's none of your business. Because of you, the police is giving us a hard time. We didn't do anything wrong. Brother... Stop it. It's too much. I'm here to teach you the rules of the gang. You take these away. If there's a bag missing, I won't spare you. Boss, Toshi is my brother. I can pass your words to him. How many times I've to repeat? Don't mess around with him. Do you feel great with him? Don't take that you're the successor and you may teach us a lesson. The old man won't allow you to do this too. Don't scare me with the old man. Who am I scared of? I'm going to see him with you and explain everything. No need to teach a lesson here. I don't buy this. What's the fuss about going to see him? Let's get it straight here. Do you dare to see him? I won't spare you for this after all. I will make pay back. Okay. As you said, we must get it straight. I'll take care of these for you. What the hell! Using the old man to scare me. Taking me as a jerk. Hey! Check out where he's sending my stuff to. Yes. Sir, be frank, I also think what Shinkai said is right. The protection money we collect now can't cover the expense of the members. We need to think of other ways to make money. I've talked to Ueda too. Enlarge the protected area. Include bars and pinball shops as well. It may increase our income. If things go on like this, the gang will break up soon. In the case that we couldn't take care of you, we may become independent straight away. It's popular in other groups with lots of members. To become independent? Will we have enough business to do? The tiny money you earned was hand it to me to invest in a bigger business. I gave you back the profit later. You'll revenge on your debtors now. Do as you want. Uncle, I agree with what they said. It's too much to hand you 70% of the income. As a boss, you should allocate more money to the member. You shouldn't use it to buy a foreign car. What did you say? I think the boss is wrong. Shinkai. I've not blamed you yet. Now you start it first. As you said, everyone can say whatever he likes. No need to care about the others. How dare you not listen to me? The boss is the boss. My words are orders. The money collected will be shared evenly. What do you think? I agree with Shinkai. The group is the most important thing. People will laugh at us fighting each others from within. Yano is right. You guys have a discussion and let me know your decision. I never see a gangster refusing to hand over money to his boss. I wonder who is refusing to hand over the money. Okay. Let's vote. Who is against it? Only Yano and Shinkai. Then do as what I said. Boss, Yamamori's gang isn't your property. Hey... How dare you oppose to the successor decision. I'll never spare him. Want a fight? Stop. Forget it. Go. Shinkai, Toshio is here. The police will look for trouble here. Ask him to hide away for 6 months. Hide away somewhere for 6 months. Boss, it's Tetsuya's decision. What the hell does he want? Could Mr. Yamamori do business in Hiroshima? The old man... Tetsuya is pulling the old man. I don't think you've no place in the group. What do you want? Coffee. Okay. Boss. Someone wants to see you. You want me to introduce him? Arita always talks about you. A real man should be brave and righteous. He should never yield. If someone looks down on you, we've no place in this society. Isn't it pitiful wandering all of your life? It doesn't work if you don't have great courage. How could you be the leader of a group? Shinkai, show me your courage. I'll support you. Do you want to be the successor of Yamamori's gang? Yamamori is no match for you. The problem is Sasaki. Get rid of him or Arita and you will never be somebody. I understand what you mean. If you really want to get on it, here's a gift for you. Let's have some amusement. But I'm not drunk. I need your support to re-build Doi's gang. You can't avoid a chance when it comes. You'll be the future boss. Alderman Kanamaru is hooked with Shinkai's gang. The showdown with Tetsuya now begins. Night 28th October, 1954 Kinichi Yamagata died. Arita, did you kill Yamagata? What? I don't understand. The murderer has confessed. Don't try to deny. Stop the bullshit. Don't take the others as fools. Stop, Did I ask you to leave here? I leave here? Why are you still here? Successor! The boss wants me to sell the forbidden drug here. How could I leave? Someone will sell it even if I don't. The boss asked you to sell drugs. Successor, you know nothing. Being a successor looks great on the surface. You stop us selling the drug. We're not doing it till now. But why did you ask others do form behind? What's your explanation? Listen! I've a safe route to deliver the drug to Hiroshima. The police won't find it out. How could I give this up? Bullshit! Do we still have principles? I'm the boss. I can do whatever I like. Don't interrupt me. I knew the protection money wasn't enough. I feel sorry for myself if I don't try to make more money. You don't like what I did. Hand me the cup and get lost. Boss, from what you said, you're no longer the one we respect. Who has contributed the success of the group today? If no one carries a sedan, can it move? If you listen to us, we'll carry the sedan quietly. But boss, you gave up righteousness for money. Shut up, bastard. I hope you will expel Shinkai and Arita from the group. Expel Shinkai and Arita? Yamagata's woman told me they're hooked with alderman Kanamaru, trying to work with Doi's gang. I'll have the matter handled myself. It's not your business anymore. Dear, how could you let him act wild? It's too much. Stop nagging. Taking you as a sedan. You're the boss of Yamamori's gang. A boss without power... Played like an accessory... How dare he ask you to expel someone! Shinkai is always supporting you. You couldn't do this. You know nothing. Just let them fight each others. These young men have no brain. They wasted all their effort on arguing. Just let them go on. I won't be a sedan manipulated by them soon. Ueda listens to whatever Tetsuya says. Uncle, looking for me? Something about Shinkai being expelled. I need to talk to you. Can you come to see me? It's late for today. Tomorrow morning. I'll see you after I go to the barber shop. I'll talk to you then. Welcome. Please wait. Get lost. What do you want? Morning 29th October, 1954 Toru Ueda died. Tetsuya got the news of Ueda's death. He decide to take revenge on Shinkai's gang. Miserable bloodsheds of the underworld began. Morning 16th November, 1954 A member of Shinkai's gang died. Morning 20th November, 1954 3 members of Shinkai's gang died. Morning 25th November, 1954 2 members of ex-Doi's gang members died. Driving license. Stop the car. Lighter. I'm injured. Afternoon 6th December, 1954. Toshio Arita was arrested. Buy it now. Boss... Morning 11th December, 1954 Uichi Shinkai died. The showdown between Sasaki's and Shinkai's gangs ended with the victory of Sasaki's. Not long after this, Hirono was released from Gifu Prison because of an amnesty of Korean War. Boss... Hey, Yano. Hirono. You had a hard time of it. The boss and his wife are waiting for you. They come as well. Come on. Ueda and Shinkai were dead. It's the Sasaki's domination now. He opened a new company to threaten my place. He's nice to others, but he just ignores me. This guy will kick me out sooner or later. He'll take over the group. Is it the righteousness he mentioned? I feel sad. I'm regretful. I hope you understand. Hirono, Now I'm protected by Yano only. If you stand on my side, the guy will come over here. Our power will be strengthened. We don't fear of Sasaki anymore. Sasaki knows you're back. He wants you to disappear quietly. It's too much. Yes. Hirono. You must help me to take on Sasaki. I count on you. Got it. But I just come back. I know nothing about here. Give me some times. It won't harm you. You must listen to me and help me. We've a lot of time. The business isn't doing good lately. Not much, but this is what I can offer you. I promised to give you money. You'll have it every month. I think it's enough for you to spend. This is the petty chase for this month. I need to go now. Please pay the bill for me. The money inside will be enough for the bill. Thank you. Goodbye. Go to my house when you've time. How much inside? 12,000 yens. Too few. Not enough to have a good time. Our group isn't doing good lately. No. He invested a boat racing field lately. He's also one of the management. He's now the most successful businessman in the province. Lat night he's a geisha party in Nagoya. Boss, he promised to offer you his property, but he forgets everything now. Coming... I'm a friend of Yamagata. My name is Hirono. I want to pray to his dead soul. Please come in. Is the baby Yamagata's? Yes. Do you have guest? Hirono Tetsuya Excuse me. You're hanging with Yamagata's woman. The baby is mine. Mr. Yamamori came to meet me when I was out. Nobody else did though. The old man told me this town was turning upside down. After you've talked to him, probably you will dislike me. I still respect Mr. Yamamori. After all, Shinkai, Kinichi and Toru were dead. Isn't the old man the boss? We've spilt up with him. I have a company on my own. It's called Ooshin Enterprise, It provides transportation for goods at the port. Makihara and others are the founders. I want to take this chance to stay away from the old man. I'm talking an ally with Kaito of Hiroshima. I count on your help. From the beginning, we want to establish an organization dealing with the free trading. Mr. Yamamori asked to come here to get to know the situation. Wait. Hold it. Don't kill me. In fact, I didn't want to betray him. Sit down. Don't you want to kill me? You don't even trust me now? Tetsuya, if Wakasugi was still alive, he'd like to see Yamamori's gang united again. Could you please re-consider it? We took the cup from Yamamori's hands, didn't we? We shouldn't have fought among each others. Am I right? I'll request the old man to act like a boss and to unite the member and the group. It may comfort the members who passed away. In fact, the old man has the same idea. Let's have a meeting with the old man and talk it over. I got it. It's damn noisy. It's late. Who's it? It's you, uncle. What do you want? Hold it. Uncle, wait. Tetsuya, what did you say to Shozo. Wait... What do you want? Stop. What do you want? I'll give what you want. Spare me please. No bullshit. Sasaki's rebellion succeeded. Yamamori announced his retirement. The future of Sasaki's company was promising. But in the celebration party, Sasaki found out the plot of Shuji's gang. Shuji met Saito of Hiroshima secretly. Shuji is always against you to be the successor. That's why he went to meet Saito. Go to Hiroshima now. We must stop Shuji meeting Saito. Boss Are you Shuji? How are you? Boss Afternoon 18th February, 1956 Shuji Yano died. It's time. Matsuyama, Shikoku. Mister, it's your call. Hello, Hirono speaking. Makihara, it's you. I think you've read the newspaper. Let me tell you. It's Sasaki who killed Shuji. Shuji was killed. I want to talk to you about this. I got it. I'll come back soon. I'm very sorry to ask you to come in a hurry. Come with me. Who else is here? Sir, you're the boss. Makihara, are you betraying Sasaki? What kind of person am I? The boss knows very clear. Shozo, you... I can't trust you anymore. I went to receive you at the prison and talked to you. But you just listens to the bloody Sasaki. He threatened me and forced me to announce my retirement openly at the open ceremony of his company. Yano tried to stop him and had a fight with him. I never thought he'd kill Yano. I couldn't believe it. I can't let Sasaki play me again. The boss will break the silence and fight back. I feel sorry for Yano. For the other members as well, I decide to get rid of Sasaki. The god-damned Sasaki met Saito trying to break up Yamamori's gang and establish Sasaki's gang. Can you accept what he's done? Don't push too hard. I'll let him know how powerful the man sitting here is. I'll torture him badly. Boss, I know well what you mean. Sasaki is shit. But you're not better than him. I won't listen to any of you. What? I'm very tired. I'm returning the cup to you. From now on, I've nothing to do with Yamamori's gang. Hirono, don't cheat me. I'll ask Sasaki to stop. Wait. To avoid being attacked, Sasaki is hiding in his girlfriend's house. At 3 o'clock every afternoon, he'll be at room 403 of this hotel. So you're the one who disclosed the hideaway of Wakasugi to the police. It's past. Who knows? Brother, how are you? Are you coming to kill me? Yes. Did Yamamori send you? I've returned the cup to him. I'm free. Why? They'll tell you why. Everything ends here. I won't run away or I'll be on the run forever. Shozo, Stop dreaming. Your dream won't come true. There's no righteous member in Yamamori's gang. In fact, I take care of the group. Wake up. You could be the boss. No matter it's Sasaki's gang or Hirono's gang, the point is to get rid of Yamamori's gang. Will Shinkai and Yano come back then? Listen! I've no choice. We're murderers after all. Shozo, look like we're not the same kind. When I drink in the night, I start to hate the underworld. I even want to quit. But waking up in the morning, I find myself back in this kind of world. I can't forget the feeling in the night. My last advise. A sniper can never hide from another sniper. Don't create a chance for others. Stop at the turn. Yes. I'll stop here. Stop wherever you like. I'm not in the mood today. Talk to you next time. Sasaki, Afternoon 19th February, 1956 Tetsuya Sasaki died. Boss, Hirono has come. Tetsuya, are you satisfied with this? If not, I couldn't do anything more. What do you want? Stand back. Hirono, do you have to make trouble? Yamamori, I still have bullets.
