I'm up. We're gonna be late for school. Uh, in fact it was Sam that requested that you be here today... And that you be involved in all aspects of her recovery. Uh, which I think in and of itself is an excellent indication of how far she's come. That said, we still have a long road ahead of us, at least six months of extensive outpatient therapy. You suffer from severe chronic depression with self-destructive ideations. Provided you stick with our regimen, there's no reason to think that you can't lead a healthy and productive life. You ready for a little normalcy, Sam? Oh, I almost forgot... Uh... Bet you're happy to be getting outta here. Not that it's such a bad place. A little dull maybe, but... Hmm... I, um... I forgot something. What's the matter? I... I forgot my toothbrush. Forget it. I have an extra one at home. I'll be just a second. Say good-bye, Sam. Cookie? Three rules. No smoking in my apartment, clean up after yourself, and respect my privacy, which means stay out of my room. Same as when we were little. Except now we're grown up, so you have to actually abide by them. Isn't this nice? So, Geoffrey called this morning. Lola's good. You're gonna have to deal with her, Sam, sooner or later. All in good time, right? Glasses are up here. Careful with these 'cause they don't necessarily always stick, so it might fall on your head. Napkins. These for the... the wipe-down and this one is good, and then use these for the glasses so it doesn't get any sticky things on it. When you come in, put your shoes on the rug. This is where you're gonna be sleeping. It's much more comfortable than it looks. Uh, that's your fitted sheet and your blanket. Hang your jacket up as soon as you come in. If you... You can go ahead and do that now. Lift it straight up, back. And then it rolls forward... Very good. Okay. Um, so you can leave that, and in the morning, right when you wake up, fold these up, put 'em back up there, okay? This is my living room. If you would keep all your stuff kind of together over here, that would be great. I got you this for your clothes, so don't leave your clothes lying around. Put 'em in here. And you might want to take a look at this. All your mail's being forwarded here. Is that all my stuff? - So, what's your plan for tomorrow? Dr. Gold in the morning. And then? I don't know. Well, I am gonna hit the hay. I get up pretty early. I... I wanna see her, Ed. - I swear, I do. I just can't. - I know, I know. I'm... I'm not ready, not now. Not yet. You gonna be all right? Get some sleep. The first time was right after my mother died. I thought it was normal to, you know, be sad... But maybe it was more than just sadness? And how did you cope with it? Well, uh... - I found out I was pregnant, for starters. - Mm-hmm. How old were you? Nineteen. Okay, and so the pregnancy, uh, turned you around? Well, at first, I... I didn't have time to be depressed when Lola was born. Um... Then Geoffrey... he got, I don't know, kind of weird, I guess. Mm-hmm. He never really got into the whole father thing. Hmm. Uh, are you still in love with him? Sam? Do you think it's time that you, uh, moved on? - I mean, let's try to put things into perspective. - I'm not crazy. Okay. You like Thai food, don't you? I'm not hungry. Dr. Gold said the medication might affect your appetite. Mmm... Oh, I love ginger. It's like a cleansing tonic. So, Geoffrey called again today. Just to check in, see how you're getting along. Lola's good. Have you taken a look at your mail? No. I really think you should. I will. Excuse me? I will. And I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my room. I... I didn't go in your room. Well, someone did. It wasn't me. Sam, you're lying. You are a liar. I asked you not to go in my room. It was very simple. So, you took the sleeping pills because... you couldn't fall asleep. And you had every intention of just waking up and, as you put it, making a a fresh start of things, right? So, why the... Why the plastic bag, Sam? Sam? I said, why the plastic bag? Well, I I've been thinking a lot about that, actually. Uh... I mean, I obviously didn't want to wake up, right? That's the crazy part. I... I wanted both things... To wake up, but not to wake up. Okay, which is completely impossible. But that's exactly what I wanted. Something... totally impossible. $1.25. How much for the...? It's five dollars for the whole bunch for them. How much for just one? We don't sell 'em by one. Okay, thanks. Come back. There. It's your lucky day. Oh, I thought this week would never end. Not from being overly busy. When you're busy, time flies, you know? Have you given any thought to going back to work? You always seemed happy at that eye office. I'm sure they'd be thrilled to have you back. I can't. Why not? I'm sure they've hired someone already. Well, what if they haven't? It's been... It's been two months. So? What if I told you I was sure they haven't? - You called them? - No, they called me. A couple of days after... After you went in the hospital. You must have put me down as your emergency contact. They were worried when you didn't show up to work. I mean, they would have found out anyway. Nice people, right? They want you back. I can't. Why not? I... I just can't. You don't have anything to be ashamed of. I'll check the paper tomorrow. I'll ask around at work. H.R. guy owes me. So, it ain't rocket science. I mean, you empty a few wastebaskets, you manage the recycling bin, you do some light dusting around the office. That sort of thing. Probably a lot different than what you're used to. Ed tells me you were an eye doctor or somethin' like that. No, I was a receptionist at an optometrist's office. Well, this is what I got to offer. Pay ain't great, but the people are nice... and the hours are good. When do I start? You busy now? No, no. I just need to change clothes, if you don't mind. Sure thing. Glad I could help. - Sorry. - No, no, don't mind me. I just, uh... Just forgot my iPod. Oh, okay. It's a nice view, right? Yeah. I'm Brian. Sam. It's short for Samantha. Everyone just calls me Sam. It's a nice name. I gotta get back to work, so... Hello? Hello? Well, tell me, Sam, what's important to you? - Seeing my daughter again. - Mm-hmm. But yet you are avoiding her. But I told you I'm not ready. Mm-hmm, and what do you think is holding you back? I don't know. I thought that's what we were figuring out. Okay, Sam, I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to be completely frank with me, no matter how uncomfortable what I'm about to ask you makes you feel, okay? So, can I count on you to be completely frank with me? Okay. Why are you collecting Saran wrap? Excuse me? Well, your sister tells me that she found a rather large quantity of used Saran wrap in your dresser. I'm curious as to why you'd want to hold onto such a thing. When I was in the hospital... Ed, uh... - She came to see me almost every day. - Mm-hmm. Pretty much every day... And every day, um, she'd bring this little muffin. It was flaxseed, I think. She said it would make my hair shiny. I felt like if I wasted any of it... even a little crumb, it was... it was like... But why were you saving the Saran wrap? That's what they were wrapped in. I mean, her hands touched it, so... So throwing away the Saran wrap is like throwing away Ed? Something like that. But it's not Ed. It's... it's just Saran wrap. You understand that, don't you? $1.25. Here you go. Thank you. Help you? How much for...? 200. What about this one? 175. You got anything cheaper? How cheap? Uh, 40 bucks? Over there. This one? No, to the left. - This one? - More left. This? But it doesn't have any wheels or anything. 40 bucks and, uh, I'll throw in a seat. What the hell is that? I bought a bike. Well, where's the rest of it? I don't have it yet. Well, don't scratch up the floor and take off your shoes. I'm not crazy. What? I said I'm not crazy. What kind of a thing is that to say? Of course you're not. Why would you say such a thing? Dr. Gold told me about you looking through my stuff. I'm only looking out for you. A lot has happened in the past few weeks... months... And... But I don't think you're crazy. I have never thought that, not... not even for a minute. It's just... - I worry. - About what? I can't say exactly. I'm gonna try and kill myself again? No! Don't say that. Then what? You know, frankly, I don't see what the big deal is. When you were in the hospital, I went through your entire life with a fine-tooth comb. It took me two weeks. That's different. Really? How? It just is. I... What'd you think you were gonna find? - Razor blades, sleeping pills? - Okay, enough! I said enough! I'm on your side, Sam. I've always been on your side. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is this? 15 bucks, take it or leave it. They were sitting out there in a puddle. No one's ever gonna buy them. Oh, really? What are you doing, then? $8. I'll tell you what. Rock, Paper, Scissors. - What? - Rock, Paper, Scissors. Best of three. I win, you walk out of here with the tires, 15 bucks. You win, they're free. Okay. Three, two, one. Scissors cut paper. Three, two, one! - Rock crushes scissors. - All right. Three, two, one! Paper covers rock. Well played. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, what you got there? It's, uh... it's for my bike. So, how... How'd you like the music? It was nice. So how about some dinner, maybe? I... I have to work. Okay. I mean, I wasn't thinking tonight. I was thinking maybe tomorrow or the weekend, maybe? Yeah, um... It wouldn't have to mean anything. - It'd just be food. - Yeah. I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean to freak you out or anything like that. No, no, it's not that, it's just... No, no, we just... We can just forget it. No. No. No...? I mean, no, as... as in yes. As... as in yes to dinner? Yeah, yeah. Really? Why not? Well, all right, then. Hey. Hey. So, what's your plan? Uh, Dr. Gold, work, and then home. I was thinking maybe we could go out tonight. Jackson Diner, maybe. I... I can't. Why not? I kinda have other plans. Other plans? I'm having dinner with someone. You mean, like a date? Um, no, just dinner. With who? Just someone I met. Where did you meet him? At work. You mean, he actually, like, works in my office? Yeah. Is it someone I know? I don't know. Well, what's his name? Brian. Brian Bender? I don't actually know his last name. Did you tell him you were my sister? No. Why not? I don't know. It never came up, I guess. Dr. Gold says it's important not to withdraw. I'm just trying to get some perspective... to move on. You don't have to apologize. I think it's great. - You do? - Yeah! Get out there. Have some fun. It'll do you some good. Brian Bender. I mean, he's harmless. He's a... he's a little flaky, but he's harmless. I'll see you. Why the smile? Oh, am I smiling? Mm-hmm. I feel good. I mean, I'm not bouncing off the walls or anything, but I... I feel, uh, different, you know? - Just... Not great, just better. - Mm-hmm. Things are coming along very well. And, of course, your meds are finally kicking in. I... I would like to see my daughter. All right, you're sure? I'm positive. Well, if she were here right now, what would you say to her? I-I don't know. "I'm... I'm sorry"? A lot of things. We have made... really great progress in very little time. And now that your meds have finally started to kick in and you're feeling better... Not great... I just think that we shouldn't jump ahead of ourselves. - I want to see my daughter. - I know, and I know... It's been two months. - I've done everything you told me to do. - Mm-hmm. - I take my medication, I got a job. - Right, Sam... I'm careful not to withdraw. I'm going out... I'm even going out on a stupid date. Sam, please, you're... And when I tell you I want to see my daughter, you tell me it's my meds kicking in. Fuck you. I don't need your fucking permission. You know, what I am suggesting is that perhaps you're not the only person that we have to worry about here. You think my own daughter won't want to see me? Well, I wouldn't know. But I imagine that she's had a pretty rough time of it. I mean, you haven't seen her since... since that day. Have you given one moment's thought to what she might be going through? Why don't you check in with Geoffrey? Just see how she's doing. Just take it one step at a time. Where's the harm in that? I won't be late. Have fun. How do I look? Great. Thanks. Don't wait up. I won't. I'll have... I'll have a cranberry juice. Hey, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. All right? - Well, what happened? - I just got totally slammed at work. And, uh, I could really use a drink... a drink. Do you... what do you want? What are you having? Actually, I think I'm gonna go. Okay, I just got here. Please. Please? - I'll have a cranberry juice. - Okay. Uh, cranberry juice for the lady, and I'll have a Jameson's on the rocks, please. Thanks. Cheers. So, how come you didn't tell me that, uh... that Ed was your sister? It... it never came up. - Is that a problem? - No, not at all. Uh... She's a real... She's a real ballbuster. So, you guys work together. She's my boss. I guess you don't drink anymore? Why do you... Why did you ask that? Well, just because you ordered, uh, cranberry juice. Why didn't you call the restaurant? I mean, I was waiting over an hour. I got totally slammed at work. I... I am sorry. If you don't believe me, please say so. Otherwise, can you just drop it and have a good time? I... I think I'm gonna go home now. - Hey, I'll... I'll walk out with you. - Yeah. Taxi! Uh... Okay, so, I am so, so sorry. Yeah. Me too. Friends? - That was quick. - Yeah. Hey! Something happen? No. What happened? Nothing. We ate dinner and I... I got tired. Did he stand you up? No. He stood you up, didn't he? No, no, he... he just showed up a little late. How late? I don't know. An hour? An hour? Tell you what. I'm gonna make us a nice pot of tea. We can watch a movie, and then tomorrow morning I will take you out for a nice, big pancake breakfast. How's that sound? Fuck Brian Bender, all right? You didn't say anything to him, did you? What do you mean? I mean, uh, about me. I'm not following you. It just seemed like maybe you might have said something. I told him you were my sister, if that's what you mean. Is that all? Oh, I get it. You got stood up, so now it must be my fault. - I didn't... - I must have sabotaged your date, is that it? No, I didn't say that. No, but it's what you thought. Well, news flash, Sam. Sometimes people let you down. Welcome to life. - I told you he was a flake. - I know. I am the one trying to lift you up, and you have the nerve to accuse me of intentionally screwing up your date. I didn't mean it to come out that... Was it Brian Bender who came to visit you every fucking day at the hospital? Are you staying rent-free in Brian Bender's apartment? Did Brian Bender pull 15 fucking favors to get you your job? - I said I'm sorry. - Well, you should be. You should be. Hello? Hello? Hello. You got to leave me alone. Don't get me wrong. I know what you're going through. I didn't come here to talk about us. I'm ready to take Lola back. I can't do it right now, um, but I got a job, and pretty soon I'll have my own place. Wait a minute. Hold on, hold up a second. Did you read any of those letters I sent you? - No. - There's nothing about a lawyer? Well, Ed told me that she gave 'em to you herself. So? I'm su... I'm suing for full custody. The papers are going through any day now, Sam. That's... that's not possible. It Is. She lives with... She lives with me. She lived with you, but now she's living with me now, Sam. It's gonna stay that way. She's my daughter. - You abandoned her, Sam. - I was in the fucking hospital! You were not a mother way before that happened. I was sick, I went to the hospital. - And... and I'm better now, see? - Sam... - You never wanted her! - That's fucking bullshit, you know that? - You left us! - I left you, Sam. That's right! That's right! You left me. You said you never would. You made a promise, and you broke it. You just don't get it, do you? Do you have a fucking clue to what you put her through? What I put her through? For six weeks she woke up in the middle of the night screaming, fucking hysterical, 'cause she thought you were dead, Sam. And she thought that she was the one who killed you. You get it now? You got to get yourself a lawyer and read those letters I sent you. - I don't need a lawyer to see my own daughter. - You got to get a lawyer, Sam. - We're gonna do this once... - No. No. - We're gonna do it right... - No. And then we're gonna be done with it. Fuck you! See you guys later. Don't drink too much. Hi there, sweetheart. - What'll you have? - Vodka. - Vodka and...? - Ice. Ice. Six bucks. Can I have another? You sure? I know you. - No. - Yeah, I know. I think I know you. I'm sure I know you. - No. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I know you. Yeah. Fuck it. Come again? Fuck it. Well... if that's the way you feel about it, honey... fuck it. Uh... So, what's your name? Uh, Ray. - Ray? - Yeah? Will you get me out of here? W-Where do you want to go? - I don't care. - Oh. Oh, we can go over to my place if you want. It's just, uh... It's not much to look at, but it's right around the corner. Just... just get me the fuck out of here. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah. - Right this way. - Yeah. Don't forget my bike. Uh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just, uh... be careful of the shoes, okay? Just be careful. I like shoes. You, uh... why don't you come in and have a seat? Over there. Okay. Yeah, uh... let me get you something to drink. You're, uh, vodka with ice, right? Right. Oh... It's not every day I get somebody like you coming in the old locker room. Say, what did you say your name was again? Anyway, uh... vodka and ice and... everything nice. Just, uh... Yeah. Not bad. Not bad at all. My tire. Excuse me? My tire. Tire? Yeah, that's a tire. Yeah. You said you'd fix it. Huh? - You said you'd fix it. - I did? In the bar. Why don't we just... Oh, just forget about the tire. You know? Okay? Just forget about the tire. Don't... Shit. Fucking stupid, man. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Look, is everything all right in there? Go away. - But I live here. - Go away. Just go away. Say, what are you doing in there? Huh? Are you okay? What are you doing in there? What was that? Wh... Huh? What was that? You all right? I'll tell you what. Why don't we come out here and, and, and... And we'll talk about fixing your tire? Huh? Are you gonna tell Ed? What? Ed? Ed who? - Yeah. Yeah. - Who the hell is Ed? Or Dr. Gold or Geoffrey? Dr. who? Geoffrey. They talk to each other. What'd you say? Okay, look, I'll tell you what. I... I think I'm gonna go out for a little bit and get some fresh air. And then you come back... I'll come back, all right? Oh... Where have you been? I've been worried sick. Did you know that Geoffrey was taking custody of Lola? Yes. I told you all along you should be reading the letters. You made it pretty clear a few weeks back you wanted your privacy, so... You think... You think I'm unfit to be a mother? I think that you need to take care of yourself. I think that you need to make sure you're healthy before you can be any good to Lola. - I love you, Sam... - Shut up. - What? - I said shut up! You sick, twisted, pathetic bitch! My whole life you've been telling me how much you love me, how you're the only one on my side, lifting me up. - And it's true. - It's bullshit! Bullshit! What are you doing? I'm leaving. Sam, you don't have to do this. We can work it out. You said some things you didn't mean, and I did too. Let's just... Let's just forget about it, and we can just... move on. It'll be okay. - I have to go. - Sam! - No. - What am I supposed to do with your stuff? Throw it out. I don't need it. - I'll be in touch. - You walk out right now... and I'm not gonna forget about it. I'm not bailing you out next time. Move. Sam, don't. Move. - I'll be in touch. - Sam! Stillwell Avenue, Coney Island, last stop. Jennie, look at this big eel. Right here. See? Look, right there. Look. You see the eel? Look it! Did you see that eel, Jess? Cool, I can see him underwater! Why are you here? I came to see you. Why? 'Cause I miss you. Why are you crying? 'Cause I'm happy. Are you gonna stay with me? I want to, more than anything in the whole world... but I can't. Not yet. Why? I have to go away. To the hospital? No, nothing like that. Just, uh, someplace different. Just for a little while till I get some things worked out. How come? 'Cause I love you. But I'll come back soon, okay? Promise? Promise. Come on, everyone. Find your buddy. I have to go now. I know. Here, let me tell you a secret. Come here. Lola, come on, honey. Make your two lines facing that way. - Kind of cold for a swim. - Oh, no, it's not. This is the time of year to go. November, when the air's cold, the water feels warm. It's all in the perspective. It's just great. Sweetie, you ought to try it sometime. It's a lot of fun.
