(film reel clicking) (rock music) - [Clinton] Hi. - Hi. - Can I, can I sit down? Or are you, are you waiting for someone? - No, yes, no, I'm not waiting for anyone. Yeah, you can sit down. - Oh hey, sorry. Clinton. - I'm Casey. I saw you staring at me. - Oh, yeah. Uh, sorry, it's just um, you seem sort of out of place here, you know? - Okay. - No, I mean, I'm serious. Why are you here by yourself? - Just came here to have a drink. - There are a million places in the city to have a drink. And no one even comes here, I can't believe you even found it. This would be my last choice if you know, I was a pretty girl. - Well what are you doing here? (soft rock music) - Don't know. - I like it here. I like the people. - Are you serious? There's got to be better people in any bar in the entire world. - Better? - Well. Classier. - Trust me, I've been to more than my share of those places, okay? When you go to those places you aren't meeting people at their truest state. - Why would you wanna do that? - They've got on their favorite designer jeans and drench themselves in their smelliest cologne and draw on their fakest smile and... You can't even have a conversation with those people because as soon you're looking in the mirror... - I don't know if I buy it. - Okay? Um... So what do you do? - I'm a spy. - Okay, look. - Shh. - You don't have to tell me, it's fine. But, how am I supposed to get to know you? - Why would you wanna do that? - You seem interesting. - All right, well, I was born in Hawaii on a um, on a pineapple farm where I spent most of my earlier years you know, running wild with the natives in the rainforests. I went off to college. - So what'd you study? - Uh, law. And, uh, and medicine, so. - So that way in case any of your patients ever filed a lawsuit, then you'd be covered because-- - Yep. - Right. - So, uh, do you feel like you know me now? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, what were you gonna do once you left here? - I was probably uh, just gonna go home. - Oh well, you know maybe I could get your number so I could call you. - You know, I was just gonna go watch a movie. Maybe you'd like to come? - Oh, uh, I don't know. What movie is it? - Why? - Well because, you know, I don't know if I wanna go if it's a movie I've seen already. - We'll make sure it's something new for both of us. - Okay. I think I can do that. - Okay, good. (slow, strange music) Uh uh. Take off your clothes. (slow, strange music) (soft, eerie music) (door closes) (door unlocks) (exhales) (door closes) (phone ringing) - Wrong number. - [Casey] Clinton? - Who is this? - [Casey] It's me. Casey. We met last night. Do you remember me? - Uh yeah, of course. How did you get my number? - [Casey] Quit joking. Are you serious? You wrote it on that piece of paper that you left on top of my dresser. Did I wake you up? - Yeah. - [Casey] I'm sorry. I just wanted to say I'd really love to see you again tonight. - You what? - [Casey] I'd like to see you again tonight. I mean, unless you're too busy spying. - No. - [Casey] Great. Then I'll come by after work. I don't know, maybe around seven? - What, no? - [Casey] I'll be right there. Clinton, I'm so sorry, I've got to run. But I'll see you tonight okay? (call drops) (slow, eerie music) - What? (birds chirping) (chain rattling) (electronic music) (chuckles) - Oh, you like her. Met her at the mall today. She asked me if I knew any good spots around here to go party. I told her, "Sweetheart. "God must be looking out for you "'cause I know just the place." (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Shane] Clint, you son of a bitch. - Shane. - [Shane] Who else would be calling you asshole? - Hey, are you, are you out? I mean, when did you get out? - [Shane] This morning. - Where are you staying? - [Shane] Eh, you know, at my mom's house. You still at that same shithole? - Uh yeah. Yeah. It's good to hear from you Shane. - [Shane] A whole fucking year man. - Yeah, fuck. - [Shane] So how come you stopped visiting me? - Hey, I'm sorry, I wanted to it's just, uh-- - [Shane] Yeah, yeah I understand, man. You're a fuckin' asshole. Listen, I gotta talk to you about something. I'm coming by tomorrow. - What? - [Shane] I'll talk to you about it tomorrow. - Yeah, just come by. (call drops) (knocking) (knocking) - Hi. (chuckles) I like your place. It's cute. - Hey, uh, how did you get my address? - How drunk were you last night? You wrote it next to your phone number. You left it by my dresser. - I did? - Mhm. You know, it was really nice of you to do that. Most guys would have left without leaving me any way to get in touch with them. Sort of like a um, one night stand. You know? - Wait. (slow, eerie music) (groans) (birds chirping) (rummaging) Shit. (rummaging) (beeping) (dialing) - [Casey] This is Casey Green. - Yeah, it's Clinton. - [Casey] Hey you. Good morning. Did you get any sleep? - Hey, what'd you do to my apartment? - [Casey] What did I do to your apartment? - Look, I don't care if you cleaned up the place, but you threw away things that were important. - [Casey] What things? I don't understand. - What, you don't understand? What don't you understand? - [Casey] Hang on. - [Man] Faster Fixer. You don't need lots of money to take legal action. - [Casey] Hi, so uh, what were you saying? - Look, don't throw away my shit. - [Casey] Clinton, I am so sorry. I'm really busy, but listen, I didn't do anything to your apartment. (call drops) - Hello? (static buzzing) (knocking) (slaps) (chuckles) - What the hell happened here? At least you got something right. I thought I wandered into another dimension where you weren't a fuckin' loser. Give me a light. (lighter clicks) Still cop from Bert? - Yeah. - How is that fuckin' dumb ass? - Still a fuckin' dumb ass. - What is this shit? - It's shit. - Yeah it is, I can't believe Bert sells this shit. - So how was it-- - I could sit here all day, asking you how you've been and shit, but we both know I don't give a fuck, so, let me tell you why I'm here. All right, I aint got dick. I'm sleeping on Morello's couch. I got maybe 20 bucks to my name. We both know I'm not the working type. You know the electronics store down on Third and Gardener? Goods? - Yeah. What about it? - You know that that Goods is one of 228 Goods Electronic stores across the country? - No. - Albert Good. Albert Good owns them all. He's richer than God. He's got a house in Encino. Now Jackson told me-- - Jackson? - Let me finish. Jackson's cousin works for Goods, all right? Anyway last year apparently the main man himself had a party, a big ass party. The party's fucking unreal from what I hear, fuckin' chicks snorting coke off each other's tits and shit. More important than that, this house, it's a fuckin' palace. Jackson's brother said that this place got like five million dollars worth of shit in it. Fuckin', fuckin' paintings, you know, rare art pieces or some shit. He also said, fucking get this, there's a tree, right? Right in the middle of the main hall, stands over 20 feet tall, but the leaves. They're not leaves. Guess what they fuckin' are? - I don't know. - Fuckin' hundred dollar bills. Fuckin' hundred dollar bills folded up to look like leaves. (laughs) - Wow, so, uh, why are you telling me all this? - 'Cause Jackson's been doing a lot of research, I think he sucked somebody off and he got plans to the guy's house. He got the guy's schedule down, and he's been spending a lot of time in the Valley scoping this guy out. - That's great. - He wants to rob him, Clinton. - That's great, Shane, that's really great. Hey, you know good for Jackson. - No, not good for Jackson. Good for us. - What is that supposed to mean? - I was locked up with one of Jackson's friends, all right? He told me about the plan he said, "When you get out, give Jackson a call, "maybe he'll let you in on it." - Come on, don't tell me you actually did it. What are you man? I mean are you a criminal now? Are you a thief? Are you nuts, man? I know you Shane, this aint you. - You don't know shit. - What, so, you actually talked to Jackson Stokes? - I know. (laughs) You remember how we used to talk about him when we were kids? - Yeah, we used to talk about how crazy he was. - Maybe. But from what I hear, Jackson has a fool proof plan to rob this guy. I mean the guy is going to like Fiji or something for a month. The point is, he wants to do it, Clint. - You wanna get locked up again, man? - Dude, we're not fucking going in there guns blazing or shit, I mean, it's like fuckin', you know what it's like? It's like that fuckin' time we robbed Jimmy Latola's house for an ounce. - Uh, only when you steal weed, no one calls the cops. - Same fuckin' thing, Clint. - So have you actually, you know, met him? - What, Jackson? Yeah. And you will too, this Saturday. - No. Not me. - [Shane] Wait. - Fuck that. - No, fuck you. Listen to me, you said I have to bring somebody or the deal's off. Dude, you don't have to do anything and I asked the guy what you had to do, and you have to fucking stand there and make sure the rent-a-cop doesn't show up, that's it. - I'm not doing it, man. - All you have to do is fuckin' stand there, asshole. Dude, dude. Dude. The guy guaranteed us $10,000 apiece. Now you cannot tell me you don't need that. - Yeah. I do. But this is nuts, that you just got out of prison. You wanna go right back? - Dude, that was fuckin' bullshit and you fuckin' know it. I had one less ounce, it's possession, it's a fuckin' fluke, man. (Clinton sighs) How about this? You're fuckin' doin' it, and that's fuckin' final. I'll pick you up this Saturday, we're going to see him. How long have we known each other man? - A long time. - A long fuckin' time. Now you remember that. You're like my fuckin' brother.

You know he's in the fuckin' hospital? - Who? - [Shane] Who do you think? - So we get back there, and she wants to party. The only thing is this type of party requires monetary expenditure. Well the only problem is, she aint got no money. As it turns out, that wasn't a problem at all. She told me she was 23. Ah. But I checked her wallet. She's 16. (muted electronic music) You like her don't you? You'd like to squeeze into something like that. Feel them skinny little legs wrapped around you. I'm tellin' you, you aint never had it like this. It was so nice. $20 and you can fuck her. You can do anything you want. You can put it wherever you want. You can put it in her ear, open her mouth up, and shit down her throat. She don't mind. Hey. Hey, bitch, wake the fuck up. (scoffs) She don't give a shit. She can't feel a fuckin' thing. (muted electronic music) - No man, I don't know any young chick, okay? Whoever she is, she's lying man. - [Shane] Oh you're so full of shit, dude. You just told me yesterday you're still coppin' from Bert. - Oh yeah. - [Shane] So what did you lie to me, saying you weren't there last night? What, do you think you can't trust me or somethin'? - It wasn't me. - [Shane] Whatever man. I'm down the street, I'm coming over. (water running) - Ah. (heavy breathing) (slow, eerie music) (heavy breathing) (knocking) - I can't believe you did that shit to Bert. He's a big fuckin' boy, I thought you had to use a bat or something. What, you're still not gonna tell me what happened? - I don't know what happened, man. - God, you must've been so fuckin' high. (winces) - What the hell are those? - Those are guns, Clint. - I already told you I wasn't doing that shit with Jackson. - And I told you you were. (lighter clicks) - Well even if I decided I was, why would I need a gun, huh? Who am I gonna shoot? - Nobody man, all right, it's just in case. Now which one do you want? You get this one then. Got anything for me to smoke? Dude, this fuckin' shit again? (lighter clicks) Mm. Dude, what's going on with you? - Look, I don't know. - You know, to be honest man, it doesn't seem like you know a hell of a lot. You don't know what happened to Bert last night, you don't know what's going on with you, what the fuck is up? Have you been laid lately? - Look, I don't wanna talk about it. - 'Cause she doesn't fuckin' exist, man. Maybe you're losing your mind. Maybe all these drugs got you fucked up. Maybe you got some kind of memory loss. You know, next week, you're not gonna remember what happened today. Maybe in a month, you're gonna have to start writing shit on top of your cock to make sure you don't forget it. - Maybe. - Well whatever the fuck's going on dude, pull yourself together, all right? It fuckin' pains me to see you actin' like such a pussy. And hide that fuckin' gun. (door opens) (door closes) (winces) (slow, dramatic music) (slow, soft music) - Son of a bitch. (groans) (dramatic music) Oh shit. Shit. (gasps) (grunts) (knocking) Who is it? - It's Casey. You know, you were supposed to call me. - [Clinton] What? - You didn't call me. - Look, I don't, I don't know what the hell you mean but shit's been weird with me lately anyway. - How? - I don't know, uh, I think I might be losing my mind. - Okay. Do you wanna talk about it? - No. - Why not? - Look, I just don't. - Well do you just not wanna talk to me about it, because-- - No, what? - If you're not gonna talk to me about it, who are you gonna-- Oh my god, what happened to your hands? - Okay, stop. Stop, all right? Don't worry about me. - I am worried, okay? I mean, you haven't even called me and your hands-- - Hey, hey, hey, who the fuck do you think I am? You think I'm like some sweet guy or something? Coming by my place unannounced like we're fucking dating? Fuck, what the hell is your problem? - I don't get why you're being like this. Um-- - Crazy. - I've gotta get back to work. I just stopped by to say hi and you're right. You're being really weird, um. Look, I've got work off tomorrow so, are you gonna be around? (door closes) I don't get why being like this, you're being really weird. If you're not gonna talk to me about, then who are you gonna-- Then I'll just leave you here. (sirens blaring) (laughs) Ah. Ah, fuck. Ow. Fuck. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Shane] I'm down the street. (call drops) - Yeah. (tires skid) - Now it's probably best you let me talk at this thing, all right? You've been fucking weird lately, and I don't want Jackson telling me to fuck off on account of you, so keep your mouth shut. You understand? - All right. - Why are you being so quiet lately man? Are you hiding something from me? - No. - Oh. Dude, I met that girl. That girl that was over at Bert's place that you decided to try and kill him. She was asking me all about you dude, wanted to know where you lived and shit. - Did you tell her? - Nah. Nah, I think I should've though, 'cause I mean she was like, and I asked her why she wanted to know, and she said 'cause she wanted to thank you. (laughs) Man I can't believe you didn't try to fuck her. She's a hot piece of ass. - All right, I just want you assholes to know this is no petty bullshit here. It's a very large and very expensive house with alarms and security. So what I wanna know right now is that each and every one of you knows exactly what you're gettin' into here. Some of you I trust. We've worked together before. Some of you I'm still getting to know. Maggot, I will tell you this, there is no trial period here. We are not dating. You fuck this up and I shoot you on the spot. Now for those of you who never learned how to count, there are five of us in this room. Each of you will have a very specific task, therefor stupidity will not be an acceptable excuse for fuckin' up. I will start with a very simple overview, I realize I must proceed very simply. Our operation will have three stages. (frenzied, strange music) And there's good chance that somebody is gonna get shot and probably killed. - You actually talked to Jackson Stokes? I don't care if you cleaned up the place, but you threw away things that were important. - [Casey] What are you talking about? - Because she doesn't fucking exist, man. Maybe you're losing your mind. Maybe all these drugs got you fucked up. Maybe you got some kind of memory loss. (knocking) - Who is it? - You got the stomach for that, motherfucker? (slow, dramatic music) - Why are you looking at me like I'm the Anti-Christ? What makes you any better than me? You've heard about things that I have done, but am I any worse than you? Who are you? What? - What the fuck are you screaming about? What's the matter with this guy? Is he hard of hearing or something? - I mean no, he's not hard of, he's fine. - I said, all you gotta do is keep your eyes open for a rent-a-cop. That's it guys. We got two weeks to prepare. Oh and one more thing. If I should hear even a whisper that anything in this room we talked about today hits the street, I will take it upon myself to personally castrate each and every one of you, and hang your motherfuckerin' balls from my rear view mirror. (dramatic synth pop music) (groans) - Oh, fuck. (muted electronic music) - I'm gonna go break you off a sack, man. You just take your time, brother. (muted electronic music) (electronic rock music) (knocking) - Hi. (soft, eerie music) - You know, I... I think you should leave. - [Casey] Why? - Because I don't know why you keep on coming here in the first place. - [Casey] 'Cause I want to. - Why would a girl like you keep coming to see a guy like me? - [Casey] Because I like you. - Yeah, like flies like shit. - [Casey] Stop beating yourself down. - Hey well that's what I am, all right? I'm a piece of shit. You know what, I thought I was the one who was going crazy, but in reality, you're the actual one that's going fucking nuts. - [Casey] I don't understand. - Oh you don't? Uh, all right. You know what I like most about you? Your pussy. That's all you are to me. You're not even a real person to me. You're a fuckin' wet dream. You know what, I don't even think you really exist. When I fuck you, I'm fuckin' myself. It's the best sex I've ever had, and that proves to me that I'm right. But you think I'm something that I'm not and it's annoying, so I'm setting the record straight right now. I'm a disease. I'm worse than fucking cancer. At least cancer is honest. It says, "Hey, here I am. "I'm gonna fuckin' kill you." You know what I say? I say nothing. I just fuck you, and then I use you, and then I slowly eat your fucking heart. So if you wanna leave, then good. Because I didn't want you in the first place. (door closes) (sighs) (scoffs) (door closes) (water running) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Rachel] Is this Clinton? - Who is this? - [Rachel] Rachel. - Who the hell is Rachel? - [Rachel] You don't remember me? - No. - [Rachel] I just wanted to call and thank you. - For what? - [Rachel] Your number wasn't easy to track down, you know. - Thank me for what, Rachel? - [Rachel] For saving me from that place. - I don't know what you're talking about. - [Rachel] Yes, you do. You rescued me from him. He drugged me Clinton. He drugged me and he raped me. - Who? - [Rachel] Bert. - And why should I care? - [Rachel] Because you saved me. Who knows what else he would have done to me. He even stole my charm necklace that I got from my mom. - I don't know what you're talking about. - [Rachel] Why are you saying this? You came in there, I heard a fight, and then you picked me up and you carried me to the hospital. You were talking to me the whole time. Don't you remember, Clinton? - You got the wrong number. - [Rachel] No. No, I remember. - Listen, it wasn't me. I don't know what's going on, but don't call me again. Okay, I don't know you and I don't know how you got my number. - [Rachel] Listen. I found your address. Maybe I could just come by and thank you in person. - Stay the fuck away from me! (door opens) (phone rings) (door closes) (sighs) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Man] Fact or fiction, you need a reason to sue somebody? - Oh my god. Oh my god. (dramatic music) (slow, eerie music) (winces) (dramatic music) (groans) (heavy breathing) Fuck. (slow, eerie music) (winces) (slow, eerie music) (phone ringing) What the fuck? (door closes) (winces) (winces) (grunting) (sirens blaring) (laughing) Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh shit. Come on. Fuck! Fuck. (heavy breathing) Perfect. (knocking) Who is it? - [Casey] Casey. - Come in! (laughs) It's not fuckin' funny, come here. Come on, hurry up. - Okay. What the hell are you doing? (laughs) Mmm, I see. Were you just waiting for me? - Fuckin' uncuff me and cut me lose before I piss all over you, please. The key's on the floor. - Oh no. - Will you fucking get the key? - Fine. (heavy breathing) (urinating) (toilet flushes) Hey Clinton? What's on this tape? (buzzing) So then you don't remember anything? - [Clinton] No. - [Casey] Not even flashes? - [Clinton] No. - [Casey] So you don't remember what happened after we went back to my place? - No. - I guess that's okay. - Okay? How is it okay? I wasn't the one saying those things, Casey. Look at you. Do you realize the only reason you're here right now in my apartment is because of a bunch of things I never even said? - You said them. - Don't you see? I have been doing things, and I don't understand why. Okay, I can't remember having done them, for God sake. Yeah, I have people calling me telling me that I kicked the shit out of some guy who was my friend. I have cuts and scratches on myself and I have no idea where the fuck they came from. You know, who knows what the fuck I do at night. What if I killed someone? - I don't think you killed anyone. - Casey, do you know what happened the first night we met? - Yes. - I know you think you know what happened, you know, your whole story about me coming over and whispering a bunch of sweet bullshit to you while you slept. I'm talking about what really fucking happened. - Yes. - I stole your fuckin' money. Your jewelry. Okay, I was gonna take it and never see you again. I was gonna sell your shit so I could buy drugs. I fucking robbed you. - I know. - What? - I know. You told me. - What'd I say? - You came into my room, and you told me that you tried to steal from me, and you told me that you were sorry. - No. - Yes. - Don't you see who I am? I mean, it's like you've got some weird, twisted dream version of me in your head. - It's not a dream. - That's not me. Your fuckin' dream man is not me. I'm a loser, all right? This is me. Shit, if you think it's really me, why don't you pinch me next time or something? - Because. You're beautiful when you come to see me. You've been coming to see me for the past two weeks. - I have? - Yeah. - Bullshit. How do I act? - Confident. And you're really loving. And you smile. A lot. - And you're falling in love with me, aren't you? - Yeah. - You're falling in love with him. You know what? I wish I did those things. You don't understand. I would give anything to know how to say those things. How to act that way. - But it is you, Clinton. You know how. You're trying to forget. - How could I forget when I've never known? - I think you've always known. (soft acoustic music) (door closes) (knocking) - Time to go, buddy. - 1574. Hm. Clinton? Clinton. (sighs) - I'm gonna go over this one more time for a motherfucker's ass. It is simple. We are to be in there no longer than 15 minutes, that's it. I aint got time to be be holding no motherfuckin' chain. (soft music) You all know your jobs, you do your jobs. - Hey. You brought it, right? - What? - The gun, you fuckin' moron. Jesus Christ. (slow, eerie music) (dramatic synth music) - Don't nobody fuck this up. (dramatic synth music) (dramatic industrial rock music) (dramatic music) - Clint. (dramatic music) Clint! (dramatic music) - [Clinton] How could I forget when I've never known? You know what happened the night that you and I met? (soft acoustic music) - [Casey] You've been coming to see me for the past two weeks. - [Clinton] Who knows what the fuck I do at night? You know what if I, you know what if I killed someone? Forget when I've never known? You know what if I killed someone? Do you know what happened the night that you and I met? (dramatic, frenzied music) You weren't mad? Don't you see the person that I am? - [Casey] Yeah. (heavy breathing) - What am I doing? (grunts) (van starts up) (soft acoustic music) (knocking) (soft acoustic music) Hi. - Hey. (soft acoustic music) - Yeah. I remember this now. Do you know what it feels like to know that it was me all along? - I told you. - I've done so many horrible things. - Listen to me. You have so much time to make up for it. You've already started to, and you don't even know it. - When I think about all those awful things I said to you... - Shh. I forgot about them the second they left your mouth. I knew they weren't you. - I remember all of this. All of this. - I'm so glad. (soft acoustic music) - Hey, hey. I have to leave town for a while. - Okay. Um... Can I come with you? (soft acoustic music) (laughing) (soft acoustic music) - I'll be right back. - Okay. (dramatic music) (hits) (grunts) - You motherfucker. - Don't shoot me, please, please. - Go ahead and beg me motherfucker. You thought you could fuck with me. You were lucky I was high. But that don't make a difference now, does it? - I'm begging you man. - You better talk real fast. - You see I met this girl. And she's amazing. And she really cares about me. And I'm in love with her, man. (gunshot) (slow, eerie music) Look, I know I'm a son of a bitch, Bert, and I don't deserve to take another breath, but I want to. I want to live. I would give anything for you not to pull that trigger. You see, I met this girl. And she's amazing. And she really cares about me. And I'm in love with her man. (gunshot) (heavy breathing) Thank you. (heavy breathing) - Is he dead? - Yeah. (gun clatters) (dramatic music) (sniffling) - Do you remember me yet? - Yeah. Your name is Rachel. - Yeah. - Yeah. (sniffling) Um, Rachel? I'm wondering if maybe you shouldn't have done that. - [Rachel] What? - Just, I don't know if I deserved it or not. - I don't understand. Wait, where are you going? (slow, eerie music) You found it.
