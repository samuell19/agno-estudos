You better wise up, the time is gonna come when all men will judge themselves before God. It?ll be the worst hell. The worst Hell on Earth. It?ll make Nazi Germany look like a picnic. And you gotta be ready for that, right now, right here right now, just like that! And that?s where we?re at all the time. Whatever is necessary, you do it. When somebody needs to be killed, there?s no wrong. You do it and move you on. There?s a revolution coming very soon. You?ve lit the fuse yourself. We?re gonna cut and chop all you fuckers up. L.A. will burn to the ground. Los Angeles will burn to the ground. Once again, you?ve judged a reflection of yourselves. We are what you made us. And when your so betrayed. [Unintelligible] I don?t know who fired the shot. I don?t know who killed the congressman as far as I?m concerned I killed him, you understand what I?m saying, I killed him. He had no business coming. I told him not to come. Die with a degree of dignity Lay down your life with dignity Don?t lay down with tears and agony. There?s nothing to death It?s like Mac said, it?s just stepping over to another plain. Don?t be this way, stop these hysterics. This is not the way for people who are socialistic communist to die. No way for us to die, we must die with some dignity. we must die with some dignity We will have no choice, now we have some choice. You think their gonna allow this to be done. Allow us to get by with this [Unintelligible] It has never been done before you think. Its been done by every tribe in history. Every tribe facing annihilation. In the Amazon their doing it right now they refuse to bring any babies into the world. they save every child that comes into this world. Because they don?t want to live in this kind of world. So be patient, be patient. I tell you, I don?t care how many screams you hear, I don?t care how many anguished cries, Death is a million times preferable to ten more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you, if you knew what was ahead of you, you?d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Death, death, death is common. One week from tonight, join me, Jack Wilson, for a special edition of Crime Scene. We?re gonna journey back to August 9th and 10th 1969. We?re waiting for our father to be set free. Two nights of Murder that sent terror through Los Angeles and ultimately, the world. Judgment Day is coming people! Next week on Crime Scene, we?re going to bring you face to face with the evil few, that forever poisoned the Love Generation. As I talk with the members of Charlie?s Family. Hear the jailhouse confessions of Leslie, the homecoming queen, twisted by Charlie into a knife wielding maniac. Bobby, the unknown lynchpin of the family who committed the first murder. Sadie, now a born again Christian, once Charlie?s most outrageous disciple. Patty, a former Sunday School teacher. She found Jesus Christ in Charlie. And Tex, the former High School football Captain, who became Charlie?s bloodiest butcher. In Charlie they found a Daddy, a lover, and a Savior. And it only took his words to ignite within them a rampage of hate and Murder. The actual killers. Bringing into focus for the first time, their years as members of Charlie?s Family. Father cares, you can tell in his voice he cares. Oh, we did so many drugs, and it made sense, I mean we were sure that it would work. How?s your day Jack? Well, she?s up for parole you know, at the end of the year. My parole hearings are taped and broadcast. There?s no return address on this one, hmm. Let me see. What the hell is that? Take a look at this, To the Pig Producer of the Charlie movie. How much more, am I supposed to suffer, for something that I did when I was 20 years old. Hook up the half inch machine, I wanna see what the hell it is. You got it. The powers of the serpent, that live inside all... Charlie. ...that is true on the line of infinity, infinity speaks in all life in the voice of the lost Child... Kill it. Hey, you know, maybe whoever sent it thinks you?ll use it. There?s no way in hell I?m gonna use that thing. Every time they even make a mention of the murders, the Family Murders, it is Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, The, the Prince of Evil, right? Very seldom have I ever seen them mention the kids that put in the knives and the bullets in the victims That?s what gets me. Bobby and Gypsy and I were sort of this... traveling family of our own. I already had that shit down, when I met him. I had my girls, he had his. This is really getting... Relax. Heavy Bobby I?m... I?m getting really bad vibes. On acid. They?re eating my skin! Help me! Volcanoes are beautiful! Fire is beautiful! No, No, No! [Screaming] Let it die! I?m gonna die! Let it die. Let it die. Let it die. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go where it wants... let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Let it die, Let it die. Bobby met Charlie. If anybody was influenced, it was him. By me. And so I met Charlie. Making music is how I met Charlie, when I joined a band called the Milky Way, Charlie was in it. He was a fine Musician, very intense, very vivid from being locked up all that time. And he was a great lyricist. I was, like a lot of kids my age, looking for God. On a quest for God. Stumbling around, taking drugs. Kind of like a blind girl in a Forest, Let me hit that now. Linda, I want you to come to the Ranch with me this time. Just for a few days. Charlie acts from his soul. Charlie is the man that we?ve all been waiting for. I was living in this apartment, with my Dog, and my life was really routine. I?d just go to work, go home, go shopping. Go to work, go home, go shopping. And, it was really a drag. And then Charlie blows in and he just changed everything. And I dropped it all. And I just took off. He brought out all these things in me that I was just sticking in slots. When Charlie got out, he was 33, he?d been locked up since he was 13. And he was lonely. And this was the first time he had a group of women that cared about him, that loved him. And Charlie loved those girls. He treated them with plenty of respect. Well, I was trying to get close to Charlie?s girls. It?s astounding that Charlie even knew Dennis, and that we were all living in this rock stars mansion in the first place. But then Dennis wised up and kicked us all out. There?s a lot of acid at the ranch. Well of course I went where the girls went. I followed them out to the ranch, and tried to integrate myself with Charlie. I came to you with all the love in my heart. And you slaughtered me man. You slaughtered me. And now I gotta hide, I gotta hide my soul so you won?t kill me. And that?s why the kids have to hide, They come out and their parents say shut up get back inside of yourself. You don?t need to be so bright, cause then we?ve got to judge ourselves. They hate to look at themselves. They hate to look at the truth in themselves man. They persecute themselves. Charlie, this is Tex. You can have anything I got. Charlie wasn?t the leader at all. He followed us around and took care of us. Are you ready to die? Yes I am. Then live forever! Being accepted by the Family and Charlie was like an answer an answer to an unspoken prayer. Before his Helter Skelter trip, everything was beautiful. All we did was smoke grass, and drop acid, and make love, as much as possible. We were forced to examine our souls, not privately, or secretly, but before Charlie and the entire family. I mean, really, everything that everything was for, was for fucking. That?s what everything was for, Man. To unify ourselves with LSD. I mean, if we weren?t fucking, we were leading up to it. It was heavy. And if we weren?t leading up to it, we were fucking. I didn?t have any experience with group sex, but I warmed up to it. The girls kept telling me, that it was my parents? hang ups, that I had to deprogram myself from their inhibitions. That?s what Charlie said the whole universe was about, man it was all one big fuck. Everything was in and out, smoking, and eating, and drinking. It was all just one big fuck. We?re not hippies, we?re slippies. Well, the ranch was fairly isolated. You had to take a back road from the Santa Susanna Pass to get there, and it was owned by this eighty year old, blind guy named George. Well, Charlie never really believed that George was completely blind. He would have one of the girls strip down in front of him from time to time, just to see if there was some sort of reaction. Charlie was always trying to cultivate George with the girls, you know, to help cook and clean, and make love to him. And of course we helped out around the ranch. Whatever, shoveling manure, grooming the horses, whatever it took to keep up a good front, and make us look good with George. And for the most part, we got along with the other ranch hands. Goddamn it move you hippie bastards! Except for Shorty. Freaks! Excuse me. Charlie tried, but Shorty was just that one ranch hand that he couldn?t work his magic on. Charlie wasn?t looking for attention. Which is why he got so much of it. You people sure have strange concepts of boyfriend, girlfriend. Hi Tex. Hey Tex. Sadie. I didn?t know what to make of Bobby when I met him. He seemed like a spoiled, super hippy, you know? Arrogant, always trying to use a power that he didn?t really have, to influence the rest of the group. What?s the problem? Last night, you said we were going swimming this morning. I didn?t know you were going to be in the barn, fucking Bobby. Look, I don?t belong to you Tex, you got that. I don?t belong to anybody. I can do anything I want, and so can you. Then why in hell did you bring me here in the first place? I brought you here to meet everyone. I brought you here to meet Charlie. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie Sometimes our group lovemaking could be pretty comical, other times it was devastating. But that?s how we were growing. We were forming a bond as a family. And Charlie was directing all these energies, but no one could direct them. Charlie wasn?t our leader. He didn?t want us hanging on him, like our parents wanted us to hang onto them. We didn?t need them. Charlie let us be beautiful. I?m willing to die for Charlie, because he?s me. Well, we believed that we were cleansing ourselves, spiritually. The goal was to achieve an inner harmony, as a group, as an example to the rest of the world. Which we saw as phony and desperate. We talk this way about Charlie, and people say, people like you, say that we?re brainwashed. But we?ve seen Charlie do things that no human being has done before. We saw him pick up a bird in the desert and breath on it and bring it back to life. And he said, See I told you you were perfect. You must always think of yourself as perfection. And I bought it, and him and the whole brainwash. Man, I?ve been trying to get a buzz off everybody. Nobody has nothing. Awwhhh. Clem! I need to get high. Pack me a bowl. Please. That was the last one. Oh, you?ve got to be kidding, there isn?t any more. No! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it, Charlie, that sucks. Hmmmm... yeah. I know some knuckleheads, we can burn for at least a lid. C?mon, let?s go. Whoa, whoa now, whoa there, whoa there Sadie! Hey, hey, hey, Charlie, Charlie, let go of my leg. Whoa whoa hey hey. Hey, whoa Sadie. Whoa. Hold on now. Oh my, you?ve got some dirty feet here, Sadie. Let?s clean them. There was a love there. A very strong, a very true love there. And if I hadn?t felt it, I wouldn?t have followed Charlie. A Joint! You?ve got, you?ve got pot! Oh thank God, Charlie has a joint. Would you light this. But until I see all of you knowing who you are I?m going to be very much what I am. God Almighty God. Who do you think sent that tape? Maybe it was a practical joke by some kids. You know, Charlie has been sort of an underground hero for a lot of these kids. Wait a minute, I want to show you something. I meant to show you this the other day. I picked it up at the Dark Fantasy Comic Book store, but look at this, Row after row of Charlie faces, look at that. And then I realized, that it?s been all been leading to right now. You know, it?s like the family, this is the last time. Because now, I?ve got the perfect body, the one I?ve wanted all along. The strongest one. The one that?s gonna make it through for the last time. Charlie told us that Children were the real leaders of the Family. They were the ones who lead the way. Since we waited on them they set the pace. Jesus Christ and his children were just kids. They were living free, without guilt, and without shame. They were able to take off their clothes and lie in the sun and be one, together. We took hundreds of acid trips together, smoked a lot of pot together, because we wanted to be like Charlie, because to us, he was living perfection. We wanted to mirror him. We had so much sex. We had every kind of sex you can imagine. We did things you?d never even think of. It?s a miracle I?m not dead from diseases by now. I had no standards, I would sleep with anybody. Anybody I wanted to, or anybody Charlie wanted me to. He would always give me to the meanest biker or the craziest whoever, because he said I could out freak anyone with sex. Alright, go ahead and print that. You know when the trial started for the Family, it was really the milestone in the death of the Hippie Movement, everyone really thinks Patty Hearst... Martin Luther King died with love! Kennedy died, talking about something he couldn?t even understand, some kind of generalized love and he never even backed it up! He sucked out! Bullshit! Love is the only weapon with which I?ve got to fight? I?ve got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight! I?ve got my clothes, I?ve got compasses, I got guns, I got dynamite, I?ve got a hell of a lot to fight! I?ll fight, I?ll fight! [Unintelligible] I call on you to stop this now, if you have any respect at all. Are we Black, proud, socialists, or what are we? Hey now, that reminds me of something. Remember the bookstore where I got the poster? OK they had both of Charlies Albums there, both of them. On either vinyl or CDs. Well, he finally made the record bins. I think it?s ridiculous. Yeah, but did you buy them? So Terry, what was it like to talk to Charlie? You could take him in very small doses. I mean, he?d throw ten things at you, you?d be on three, he?d be on seven and getting real physical about it. He?d, he?d bend over, he?d pick up a handful of rocks and he?d toss them into the air and say See, you can throw it all away and it?ll come back to you. We?re flashing with divine harmony this morning. I just wrote two songs while the sun was rising. Very, very, Groovy. Charlie was not willing to sell out to the Record producers, which is the first and most important requirement before the industry is willing to handle an artist. Do you want professional sound! Maybe something you can use? I suggest you get in the booth and ... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What?s the problem here, huh? Many musicians say they don?t care about the money, yet they commit themselves to be at given places, at certain times, and to produce what sells. Whether they believe it or not. Charlie didn?t want that success. Charlie wanted success on his own terms, he didn?t want to be imprisoned. I know what?s best for us man, I know! Do you know anything about the acoustics in this studio? Do you know anything about EQ? Do you know anything about mixing? I know about the Energy Rays of a free love society, and I know your cold heartless technology hasn?t defined that yet? Amen, Charlie. But it?s there, it?s here, It?s here, dig? Like a thought, it?s a thought, it?s in a thought, it?s in a thought from me to you? I don?t have to take this shit! Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry c?mon man! Charlie, what are you doing, you don?t go slapping people! Well fuck you and your bullshit Studio! Hey, is that what you think Man? Charlie does things his way. He don?t conform to the pig rules of the establishment. So Terry, you worked in the studio with Charlie. Now you?re his Producer. What, what did you think of him, as a musician, as an artist? Charlie was at the edge. Just the whole sixties scene, L.A. Things kind of built to a critical mass and at one point, I actually thought, Well, maybe there is something we could do with this, but, But the music was really crap, wasn?t it? Yes, the music was crap. We?re so formal over here, on the BBC. [Charlie singing] Just come and say you love me, give up your world, c?mon, you can be... I mean things looked good for Charlie and everybody was just goofing with their head in the clouds. Well, we gave up our own birthdays and renounced our families. Charlie didn?t allow any clocks, calendars, or anything like that on the ranch. Dennis and Bobby were donating food, cars, women whatever. It was always submit, give something to Charlie. Submit everything you had, submit your ego. If you do not give me the deed to the ranch, I will throw you on the rail road track! Ahaaaahhhhaaaaahhhhhh! Help! Save me, save me! We?d just drop acid and share out of this big pile of clothes and costumes, and role play the day away. Changing situations and characters. Well, you?re all going to be clearing out of here pretty soon, because George is getting real tired of you giving his ranch a bad name. I don?t understand all you little creeps. Charlie?s not Jesus Christ, he?s not the Devil. He?s just a little con man, he?s spent half his life in jail goddamn it! Well once the bikers and ex-cons moved onto the ranch, it became a chop shop for stolen cars, and dune buggies. And Shorty began taking down license plate numbers. Now Shorty was married to this black go-go dancer, and that just burned Charlie up because it went totally against his racial philosophies. Hey you nigger lover! I heard your wife takes it up the ass. Is that true? Well loose lips sink ships. He never said, in so many words that he was Christ, but he would imply. Like, when he?d look at me and smile and he?d say ?Don?t you know who I am?? I made love to Charlie last night. Yeah? How was it? Well, it was... C?mon... Like what was it like? It was, it was great. It was kind of scary. He said all these really nice things to me. Then when he started to come... he got real tense. And then he climaxed and I came but... I got all... tense. It was like, I couldn?t move my arms for about a minute at all. I was paralyzed. It was real scary. That?s because your ego was dying. Until you give of yourself completely, and your ego?s dead, you can?t be at the now. See what I?m saying? But it happens, you know. Stop this nonsense. Don?t carry this on any more. You?re exciting the children. No, no sorrow that it?s over. I?m glad it?s over. Hurry, hurry my children, hurry. Hold it down, we?ve got time. It?s an act of suicide, commit an act of revolutionary suicide. We are now at the end of reason. We are motion itself. We are eternal revolution. If you get behind the wheel you?ll kill us both! Now give me the keys. Give me the keys, I?ll be back in the morning. No. Give them to me. No, I?ll take us home. C?mon have a drink. I gotta go home. Thanks for nothing! I?m sorry. Hey Simi, what?s the matter? Nothing. Do you want some of this? Hunh-uh. Tex was trying to please Charlie. What are you doing? Come here. Charlie loved it when they brought young girls into the Family. ?Young Love? is what he called it. Go get me some young love. Hey, I?ll take you home, I?ll take you home. Don?t worry about it. I?ll get the keys to the bread truck from Charlie. Okay enough. Go get the keys from Charlie. Only if you promise to come to a party with me. What party? We throw parties here all the time. Everybody wants to meet you. Just come to this one, okay? OK. OK? Terry was supposed to come in and record us in our natural environment. Charlie thought a record deal was coming too. When I showed up, the ranch was in full swing. Yeah, we had high expectations. Charlie had us clean the place from top to bottom. We had zuzus, hundreds of joints were rolled. And the girls, well they prepared this outstanding vegetarian feast. The food that those stores threw away was perfectly good, and we only took the very best of what was there. [Charlie singing] Oh garbage dump, oh garbage dump, Why are you called a garbage dump, The first day I came to the ranch, Charlie sent me on a garbage run. He said take some clean clothes ?cause you?ll get all dirty. And so I went down to the market and I hopped in the can, and we went through everything and got all dirty and we just took the best of everything. And we took it and cleaned it and took the skins off and cut all the spots out. Nobody goes hungry here. You could feed the world with my garbage dump, You could feed the world with my garbage dump, Charlie I?m sorry man. I?m sorry I couldn?t make it. I was uh, I was tied up in a meeting, okay. Hey, hey whoa, Charlie, Charlie, ease up man, I never promised you I?d be there. I said I?d come if I could, okay. Yeah. It?s like I tried to explain to you before, OK. The record execs don?t think your stuff is marketable right now. What I suggest that we do is we?ll sit on it until spring and who knows you, by then you could be the biggest name since, since Jim Morrison. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean make up my mind. This one little space in time, where Charlie was there. But he wasn?t there. Little freak. Ahhh, ahhh! Nobody cares about my music. Nobody cares. Charlie felt betrayed. His album was going to make us rich and it was going to spread his message to the world. I mean it didn?t slow us down, we all the makings for a great party. When Simi came with the family, she was a virgin and she was scared. She was scared stiff. Charlie?s about the hippest guy I ever met. He?s going to open doors in this little brain of yours. So will this. What?s that? This is LSD. Here take two. We?ve already dropped. The whole Family?s tripping tonight. I haven?t done any hard drugs before. It?s not a hard drug. Oh, we don?t do any hard drugs. It?s just, it?s just acid. It?s not like it?s heroin or cocaine or anything. It?s a groove. I don?t know how. What do you mean you don?t know how. It?s just like going to the doctor?s office. Stick out your tongue and say Ahhh. Say, Ahhh. Well, I guess, I?ve always wondered, what it?s like, you know, to trip. It?s a groove. Say Ahhh. Ahhh... Say Ahhh. Ahhhh On her first big experience with the family we all tripped on acid. And she plum tripped out on that. She flipped completely out. We were all tripping right along and we balled her brains out. It wasn?t rape, she loved it. Ahhhh! It it?s like... she would start fighting and she?s fighting and scared and fighting. And then she?d calm down and go ?uhhhh?. And then she?d realize what was happening to her, and she?d get all scared and frightened. And and Charlie was sitting in the corner just directing the operation. Yes I knew who Simi Sherry was. And I know she was raped. But that was Bobby and Charlie, I had nothing to do with that. No, she just vanished. Never heard from her again. I pray for her now in my nightly prayers. I just thank God she got out when she did or else she might have ended up in prison too. You?ve got the nerve to pray for me. I?m just as... you?re just as... disgusting as I am! It?s your fault. I?ve always hated you! You ruined me! You ruined my whole life! All my life! We struggle. I mean we struggle with ourselves you know. Charlie, I am not going to give up all my possessions and come live with you, man. Suddenly there was a lot more talk about fear and its usefulness. Be like an animal, be like a coyote. Use fear to help you exist and to live in the now. Well, I think I tried to make myself believe I was a witch. I was, Yanna, the good witch. Charlie just shifted gears. We ignored the establishment and we ignored reality even more than we before. We just continued on with the ?Magical Mystery Tour?. Charlie got that from the Beatles. He called life, or the flow of life, ?The Magical Mystery Tour?. We were all part if it, one mind, one soul, one body within it, and with it. It?s a total state of paranoia, it?s, it?s man when you?re that aware, you, you can feel everything, you can see everything that moves, you can hear everything that makes a sound, you could smell every smell. And when you?re that aware, you?re at the now. This is when we started going out on ?Creepy Crawl? missions. Well, not breaking and entering. Creepy Crawling. You what? We Creepy Crawled them. A few of us would drive into some wealthy neighborhood, and we?d pick a house and we?d steal right from under these people?s noses while they slept. You had to be super aware. You had to be aware of every move you made. Well sometimes we?d drop acid to heighten our awareness level. We Creepy Crawled probably fifty houses or more, and we never got caught. Not once. You stay positive. You confront your fears. You say yes to your fears, submit to them and overcome them. No sense makes sense. You can?t get caught if you don?t got thought in your head. Sometimes we would steal from the people?s houses that we broke into, other times we?d just move the furniture around to freak them out when they woke up in the morning. I was a master criminal. I can?t believe you?ve ever been alive. You don?t deserve to live. I hate you. You gotta go too! Take me Elizabeth! My name is Cassandra! You killed me first! Charlie developed this game. We?d take really strong LSD and sit in a circle around an empty chair. Charlie called it the fear chair. We?d stare at this chair while Charlie spoke. He told us to imagine a rich establishment pig sitting in the chair. Now it?s the pig?s trial he?d say, and we?d stare at this imaginary person and project his fear right back at him, keeping him immobilized with his own projected fear. Keep judging yourselves in Charlie, but don?t look in the mirror! I don?t remember exactly when my mind crossed over from reality to imagination, but there was no escaping it. Things seemed so doom-laden that summer. Everything that Charlie preached seemed like absolute, divine driven truth. And, Charlie wasn?t preaching about death of the ego anymore. Now he meant violent death. Physical death. And when he said death is beautiful, he meant it. Death is beautiful, because it it?s what people feared the most. Death is merely an illusion anyway, because the infinite soul can never die. If you?re not dead, you will be soon. Tex was in bad shape. Charlie had told us all we had to ?cease to exist?, but Tex never could. Free the mind, and your ass is bound to follow. It?s like he wanted it both ways you know. One minute he?d be bad mouthing Charlie, and the next minute he?d be saying shit like ?I am Charlie and Charlie is me?. You dig man? Well, here we are. Give me the money. You bring it out, I?ll pay the dude. No man, no fronts. The man doesn?t front for anybody. He?d be running it fifty yards from the house and taking the money right back. That?s not a fucking front. Hey look he?s not gonna change his rules for me. Now do you want this or not, because I don?t care. We can go right now. C?mon Lotsapoppa. Give me the money. I?ll be back in a flash. I don?t like this. Lotsapoppa called the ranch madder than hell, and Charlie took the call. Who is it. It?s Charlie, man. And Charlie, talked to him, soothed him out, cooled him. And said don?t come down here, I?ll come over there and we?ll settle this thing. Where you going? Hey baby, what?s your name? Get the fuck off of me! You poor child, you must be Rosina. Hey man! I?m talking to you! Get over here! Marnie, would you untie this poor girls hands? Where you going? Look motherfucker, you keep her tied up! Aw, come on man, this little woman couldn?t out muscle you. Alright motherfucker, get up! Get up! And put that fucking gun on the table! Easy! Easy it?s going. I said easy! It?s going easy. Oh the race war was something we believed in totally. It wasn?t the reason for the murders, but the belief that there was going the be a great race war was something that hung in the atmosphere and drove us crazy. Charlie thought Lotsapoppa was a Black Panther. Nothing has changed since we talked on the phone man. And if Tex ain?t got every last cent of that money, he?s wasted. I?m gonna kill him. He?s gonna be wiped out, you dig it? That?s not necessary. Take it as a gift from me. Gift? Please. OK. And here you are. Kill me. My life in exchange for my brother. Shoot me. Amen Charlie. He?s whatever a person wants to make of him. He?s a mirror, actually, a reflection of yourself. Get up. They?ll both be right here when you get back. If we don?t fuck?em to death. I?ll get Tex for you. Marnie, I?ll be back soon. Now you making sense little man. What are you gonna do? Shoot me? How could I shoot you with an empty gun? There are no bullets in it man. Alright you little fuck. [Gunshot] [Scream] Drop it. In everything that?s ever been written, people always overlook how important that shooting was, and the impact that it had on the future. Charlie was terrified that the Black Panthers would come down on us for shooting Lotsapoppa. That?s a really nice shirt you?re wearing there. I like it, I really do. Could I have it? I sure would like to have it. I remember hearing about the cop who shot the sixteen year old black kid. We had the race riots in Watts, the Black Panthers in San Francisco, Martin Luther King had just been assassinated. So Charlie?s rap didn?t seem too far out at all. It didn?t seem like it was going to happen a month from now, it was happening right now. Right now. I love you. I do. I think that?s really the crux of the entire story here. That, that was the springboard for these killings. That was the first domino to tip over, and it, it lead to the rest. It?s gone man. Here, pack him some more in there. You fucking guys geeking. I ain?t geeking on nothing, man. I mean, I guess not, this shit fucking sucks. I can hardly geek off of it myself. Give me some more. Hey man you want one of these? It feels good and everything, but I don?t need it or anything. Well, who does? You guys take too big of hits. Jesus Christ! You fucking whine so much man. Why don?t you take your turn? Thank you, finally. I thought I said it was fucking empty last time you handed it to me. He is god! Why do you think they?re sending him to the gas chamber? [Gunshot] Now you try. Squeeze the trigger. You?re pulling. Don?t put it in your mouth. Squeeze. Stop it. I want to talk to you and your people Charlie. Never point a gun at anyone. You tell me what happened to Simi! Simi who? We opened up her mind. She split. Her parents called. She hasn?t been home for five days. Goddamn hippies better be straight with me. You better watch what you?re saying Shorty. Or I?m gonna have your head in a box. Snitches? Snitches will be taken care of. Chief it?s, it?s 6:00. Already? It sure is. You know, not everybody in the world?s a workaholic like you happen to be. And Annette?s had the day off, and I?ll bet ya, when I get home, I just might have a couple of steaks on the grill, and maybe a cheap bottle of wine waiting. Well, I think I?m going to hang around for about another hour or so, anyway. A lot to do. Well, I?ll see you about nine in the morning, OK? Alright, sounds good. Say hi to Annette for me. Sure will. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. People, [unintelligible] [Indian noises and voices.] [Unintelligible] Lets be dignified. If you don?t tell them their dying we might be able to stop some of this nonsense. Charlie?s the only complete man I?ve ever met. He won?t let any woman talk him into anything. He won?t take any back talk or whining. Ahhhh! Tex! Oh, we?ve missed you, Charlie?s missed you Where the hell have you been? Are you staying? Yeah. Yeah. What?s that? You?ve got a lot of catching up to do. He never really gave orders. He was so evil he would just scare us to death with his preachings. Every night he?d tell us that there was going to be a race war, and that whitey and the blacks were going to go to war, and it was going to he the worst war the world had ever seen. And he said that we had to be ready to save the children and rescue the homeless babies, and carry them off into the desert to safety. And he said we had to start collecting dune buggies, and guns and supplies and all these other things to help us survive. And then he would just calmly pull out this buck knife and he said I don?t know about the rest of you, but I?m going to start carrying a knife. There?s no good or no evil, there just is. Did you have any idea you were going to be one of the apostles? Hmm? An Apostle? What the hell is that supposed to mean? C?mon Tex, why else would you and I be here right now? Why would any of us be here? Oh. Charlie. That?s right. C?mon Patty. Tex... Well, you know who he is don?t you? It?s all true Tex! I know about these things, I know it?s all true! I used to teach Sunday School. I was studying to be a nun before I met Charlie. The Gospel according to Charlie is all you girls know. You?re absolutely fucking right Tex, because Charlie is Christ and Christ is love, and Charlie is love. That makes Charlie and Christ one. The Beatles laid it all out on the White Album. The four angels with the faces of men and the hair of women, that?s the Beatles. And the Breastplates of Fire. That?s their electric guitars, see? You know who the fifth angel is, don?t you? Don?t you? I?m just so sick of this mind-fucking bullshit. You better be ready. Two weeks everybody?s carrying a knife, and Charlie?s teaching us the best way to slit a person?s throat. Just like there?s no past and no future. Just now, that?s all that?s important. The time is gonna come when all men will judge themselves before God. It?ll be the worst hell, the worst hell on earth. It?ll make Nazi Germany look like a picnic. And you gotta be ready for that right now, right here right now just like that. And that?s where we?re at all the time. Charlie set up Helter Skelter patrols. We kept 24 hour a day lookouts posted with shotguns around the ranch. It was perfect timing for Charlie, because the Family was starting to drift apart. But now we were being pushed to the last safe corner of the earth, the desert. Now, the District Attorney made up the lie that Charlie was trying to start this black, white war to bring on Armageddon. Charlie didn?t start the war. As far as we were all concerned it was already coming down. Helter Skelter is the name of a song performed by The Beatles, period. Helter Skelter was very real to us. For all we knew it was happening. All the events were taking place. And we thought we really had to get to the desert. That the desert was the only way that we could be saved. We?d still make music and orgy, but now it had this dark underbelly to it. Everything was Biblical and Apocalyptic. We will kill anyone who gets in our way, period! What are we gonna do Charlie? Creepy Crawl some pig?s house? Of course I loved Charlie. I felt like he was the Messiah come again. You know the Second Coming of Christ. King of the Jews. Drink from this. For this is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many. And the flames blew up like the devil?s breath! Shed for many. I?m the Devil! I?m the Devil! The Devil! Charlie, I?m the Devil! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts. And they had a King over them, which is the Angel of the Bottomless Pit. Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Latin tongue, hath his name is Exterminans. And I started to space it real bad. And I fucking looked over and Charlie looked like the Devil, man. I said, ?Man, I think we?re in hell?. And he said, ?Yeah, ain?t it groovy? I was getting some real weird pictures. So I get out while the getting was good. What do you mean leaving, you can?t? Will you go with me? Why? You can?t leave. I overheard Tex and Sadie, and they?re watching you. I gotta get out of here. Why? What is going on? I?m sacred. What?s wrong? Charlie asked me if I would kill somebody. What?s in the bag Sunshine? Hi Sadie. You can?t kill. Kill. Bunch of people with their backs up against the wall, willing almost to... Kill someone? Oh, yeah. In a split second. Kill crazy and throw your life away. Any traces of my own will or personality had totally dissolved by this time. I was just as extension of Charlie, and I took my role of enforcer very seriously. Where were you going? What?s the big deal? I just wanted to be by myself for a while. She was wearing these. I like to see in focus. You were running away. I wasn?t running away! Look what?s the big deal all of a sudden? You guys are acting like the ranch has become a military camp. Take them off. Charlie told you not to wear them. Stop it! I want to wear them! Don?t you ever leave the ranch without telling anyone! Going out to Death Valley, you know, it made a lot of sense. Somewhere that we could raise our children, and let them teach us some of the things that we need to learn. In a place that?s closer to the land, and the stars, and the spirit of life. Do it again and I?ll kill you! We?ll hang you in a tree, and we?ll cut your tongue out! You got no idea how desperate things were out there. I?m not talking frustration, I?m talking lunacy. [Chanting] Charlie thought that Gary had inherited a lot of money. So Charlie asked Gary to join the Family and come with us to the desert. Gary said no, so Charlie told Bobby and I to try to convince him. I?ve given you, given you all help in times of need. But I?m not following Charlie into the desert. I have my life, and it?s here. We?re not asking you to change Gary. You can bring your, your... Gohanza. Your Gohanza out there. You can have everything there that you have here. We love you Gary. We need you, man. I need you. No, alright? You?re still my brother, and my sister, but I must be true to myself. Last chance. It?s gonna take a lot of money for a move of this kind. I?ll give you forty dollars, okay. How about twenty grand? How about it? We need that money Gary. The whole thing with Gary was that he had burned me on a thousand tabs of mescaline. I went there simply to get my money back. I think you should leave right now. Bullshit. We ain?t kidding Gary. Bobby, what are you doing? Look, I don?t know what Charlie told you, but I don?t have twenty thousand dollars, and I?m not paying. You?re bullshitting me! Stop it Bobby. Get out of my house! Watch him. I?m gonna find it. He?s not gonna find anything. Shut up! We trashed this place, we turned it upside down, I don?t know what else... I don?t know if he has it. Alright, fine. OK. Alright, fine. We?ll be here. You?re making terrible causes. Causes you?ll answer for in later life. Charlie?s pissed at you man. You can?t change the causes you?ve made, but you can counter them with positive ones. What the hell. You too Sadie. Just go. Tell that to Charlie. [Music playing] I can?t think with that shit on. [Music playing] Trippy chick. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Gary had no stomach for what was going on. He just kept saying over and over again that he didn?t have any money, and, and he was tired, and he wanted to go to sleep. Me and Bobby looked everywhere in that house for money. [Knock on door] That?s Charlie. Let him in. Finally Bobby didn?t know what to do. Get up. Get up. Hey Charlie. Where?s Bruce? Charlie, I don?t think you know what you?re doing by this. I want to talk about that money Jack! Right now, where is it? Take your people and get out. [Scream] Don?t man. Don?t come back without the money, man. During my trial the prosecution wanted to involve Charlie in my case. Which is difficult because he was never there at any time. I cut Gary, when we were fighting. And it wasn?t his ear, it was more like this little slash on his cheek. Take this. It?s a little safer. Clean up woman! I think at that point Charlie knew what was going on, but we didn?t. I know Bobby was not at all ready for what was happening. Shut up! I?m gonna go get someone to fix his ear. You?re not going anywhere. Look, we don?t have bandages... And he will keep bleeding until you tell us where that fucking money is, Gary! He?s not gonna tell us a fucking thing unless we help him! That?s right! I?m gonna rip this place apart, and you?re gonna watch him. I am going to get some medical supplies right now! You do what I say Sadie! Fuck you! You?re so fucking stupid. Here Gary, drink this. We gotta do something, we can?t stay here much longer. I?ve turned this place upside down, what do you want to do? Well call the ranch, ask Charlie. Ask Charlie? Ask Charlie, sure. Charlie always has an answer, right? It?s not always the right answer, but he always has an answer. What the hell else have we ever done? That?s right, what the hell else have we ever done? You bastards will fry for this. You?re descending into the lower worlds Gary. Where?s your faith? [Chanting] Call the ranch Bobby. Maybe Charlie will let us take him back there? Hey Charlie. No, nothing, zero. [Chanting] What?s going on? [Chanting] No, Bobby, Bobby No! No! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Stab him again Bobby. [Chanting] Bobby, would you help me! To die is a beautiful thing, it?s, it?s everything, it?s every color in the spectrum of light, every sound, every note in all music. I returned and tried to cover up my tracks. But I left some prints. Why ?Political Piggy?? To put it off on the blacks. Well, that?s why Bobby made the paw print, you know, the Black Panthers? I had a lot of anxiety over getting busted. I split the ranch on the pretence of ditching the car. Some cops woke me up one morning on the side of the road. Called in the car, found the knife in the car, hauled my ass in, effectively negating all of my creative efforts forever. This is all your fault Charlie! Shut up! You shut up! As long as any of us are in jail, we?re all in jail, you know. I?m walking around out here, but I?m in jail with every single young person that should be free, you know. I?m in the Hall of Justice with Charlie, and I?m on death row with Bobby. Wow, they got Bobby. It was for the love of brother. This had nothing to do with the race war, no, no blacks against whites, no Armageddon, it no White Album, no Helter Skelter, that wasn?t what it was about. Then he went on about how we were a family and we weren?t going to let one of our brothers rot in jail. Girls loved Bobby enough to do this, as they took these people?s lives, they were willing to give their own lives. And that?s what they?re doing right now on death row. It?s for the love of brother. We knew that Charlie was willing to give his life. He brought up the subject of Lotsapoppa, and how that had been my mess, and how he had to clean that one up. That he had taken a life, and now it was my turn to repay that debt. Well the girls, decided if they found, the police, if they found more bodies, with, with writing on the wall in blood, that, that they?d assume the killer was on the loose, and they?d let Bobby go. He told me that the girls had a plan, and that they needed me to help them carry it out. He said, go to Terry?s old place, take all the money you find, and kill anyone there. I was getting into my Creepy Crawl clothes and me and Tex were sneaking some speed, and getting ready to go. Linda, get up. Wake up! Now, you?re gonna need your drivers license, a change of clothes. Put on dark clothes like I?m wearing. And bring your knife. Linda. I want you to go wherever Tex tells you. Everybody, do whatever Tex says. He knows what to do, listen to him. And leave a sign. You girls know what I mean. Something witchy. So I led them there. I had been there three times before. I would step out of this casket like some freaky vampire or something, and I would point at my victim Shut up! And I would dance in front of him. I wish you?d shut up! Shut up, shut the fuck up! We?re driving! Go! I had the girls wait in the car while I climbed the telephone pole and cut the wire. I went down an embankment, climbed a fence and over some barbed wire. We were headed toward the house when we saw a car coming up the driveway. Down! Get Down! Hey! Please I won?t say anything! It?s starting, come on. I turned the engine off, rolled the car back a few yards, and I told Linda to keep watch. Then I went up to the house, I slit a screen, climbed in, went to the front door and I let Sadie in. Go check for other people. What time is it? Who are you? What do you want? I?m the Devil, and I?m here to do the Devil?s business. Linda, Linda, I need your knife. What?s wrong with you? Listen for sounds. Now Sadie came back in with a woman dressed in a nightgown, and told me that there was another couple in one of the bedrooms. Watch her! What? Watch her! No! Move! I?m scared. Be careful with her goddamn you! Silence! One more word and you will die. He means it! Get over there. Stand there! The methamphetamine crystal that I had snorted earlier was blurring everything together. Time was telescoping. As soon as I had a thought I was already physically acting on it. To me these people were not human, they were less than human, they were artificial. Let her go, can?t you see she?s pregnant. [Gunshot] Please, oh God please! Shut up! Shut up! Please, we?ll give you anything you want. I want all the money you have here. I have money in my bedroom. Please, let me get it for you. Sadie, go with her. How much did you get? Seventy two dollars. Seventy two dollars, is that all you have? How much, do you want? I want thousands! We have more, we can get more, much more, if you just give us time. Please, please? You know I?m not kidding. I know, I know. [Screaming] Please stop! I?m the Devil. What are you going to do with us? You are all going to die! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Kill him! No. [Screaming] Help! Help! Help me! Help me! I?m so sorry! My god, I?m so sorry! I?m so sorry! I?m so sorry! Tex! Tex help me! Help me! God, I?m so sorry! Ahhhh, stop! I give up, take me. Please, make it stop! It?s too late. Just take me with you. Take me with you, and I?ll have my baby. Just let me have my baby. I just want to have my baby. Please let me have my baby! Look bitch, I don?t give a shit about you, I don?t care if you?re gonna have a baby. You?d better be ready, ?cause you?re gonna die, and I don?t feel a thing about it. Kill her. Kill her! [Screaming] You have to have a real love in your heart to do this for people. Well, what?s the big deal? A million babies are born and die each day. Tex told me to dip a towel in her blood and write something that would shock the world. So I did. Charlie was waiting for us when we got back to the ranch, sitting naked in the moonlight. He asked us if we had any remorse for what we?d done, and of course the right answer was ?no?. I remember Patty telling me about it and then I went through a change and, and I thought, right on, I guess we did it. Well, the next night, Charlie gathered up Clem, Sadie, Leslie, Patty and me, and, told us to come with him. Well, um. Charlie made sure that he, he sort of made me feel really guilty and said that I should want to do it, because it was going to help Bobby. Linda drove of course, because she had the only valid drivers license. And we went to this house that Charlie had once partied at and he said we?re gonna do the one on the right of that house. He said that the night before had been too messy, and that this time we were gonna do it differently. So he went inside and he tied up the couple who lived there with some leather laces, and he came back out and he told uh, Patty and Leslie and me to go in and kill them. Charlie, can?t, can?t we just, can we just go now? Can we just go now Charlie? But don?t tell them what you?re gonna do. Don?t scare them, that way they won?t fight. Where are you taking her? Shut him up! We?ve got money. You don?t have to do this! You?re gonna kill us, aren?t you! Please don?t, please don?t, stop! You don?t have to do this. I?ve got money. I?ve got money, you don?t have to do this. No, leave me alone! You don?t have to do this! Oh! No. Where is she? Where is she? Rosemary! Rosemary! Shut up pig! Shut up pig! Because I was... I was in love with Bobby. [Screaming] No, No, No! Leno, Leno! Help Leno! Leno! Leno! Leno! Leno! [Screaming] Die pig, die! Die, pig die! Did you kill her? No Patty did. Oh, you gotta stab. Stab. If you are willing to be killed, you must be willing to kill. You gotta stab. I know now... that... that what I did, was to Rosemary and Leno, and not to things, and not pigs. God, I?m so sorry. I just want to get out of here, so I can make something good with my life. Oh, I had Patty write on the walls, and the refrigerator with their blood. The girls got something to eat from the refrigerator, I took a shower. And then we just hitch hiked back to the ranch. They?re willing to be in jail. They know that they?re in jail for everybody. And maybe we?ll all have to go to jail before we can get them out. Maybe we?ll have to go up to the jail and say, Hi, take me. But they know they?re facing the gas chamber, and they don?t care. That?s what people don?t understand, they don?t care, and they?re willing to die for all young people to be free. Snitches will be taken care of. Charlie said, Charlie said they had to kill Shorty. He had to have Clem chop his head off. I heard that Shorty wouldn?t die unless they chopped his head off. Charlie said he knew too much. He actually punched her out. Shorty? Charlie. So we cut him into ribbons. Shorty? Right. First we dosed him. Then we hogtied him while he was tripping. We stuck needles under his fingernails. And in his eyes. Through his nipples. And cock! It?s not nice to snitch Shorty. He pissed himself. Piss and blood. Then we drug him through the mud And he was screaming for his life And Charlie gave the word And we stabbed him like Caesar Everybody, the whole family. He just wouldn?t die, we just kept stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing, and stabbing, and stabbing So Clem cut his head off. We cut him into nine pieces. And buried him in nine places. His legs are buried right under you. It?s not nice to snitch. The girls made up that story about us chopping him up into nine pieces. Even the prosecutor put that in his book. But when Clem led the Police out to the ranch, they found the skeleton intact of course. No, no! Pull over! Get out! God help me! It?s ready. The revolution is ready, and as soon as Charlie gets out it?s on. The revolution is on! And if you try to hurt Charlie, you?ll all die! He is God, Perfect. As perfection is. Because it?s exactly the same thing. I had a brother once, who was shot and killed like that, for nothing in the war. I mean, it?s exactly the same thing. Every single day love is being killed. We?re all in this together. You gotta stab. As long as Charlie is locked away in his asylum, prison, grave, you can say anything you want about him. You can make more bogus books and movies about his life. You can joke about him, you can pretend to be him, you can say and do anything you want. But the truth is, you don?t have the soul to face him. You?re a lot of vultures. You are. You live off the sacrifice of the young people. You?re bloodsuckers, you are, with your little phallic symbols you know? We?re waiting for our father to be set free. He?s a genius, you don?t realize. It?s the second crucifixion of Christ! Judgment Day is coming, people! Leslie?s lawyer, Ronald. The press called him ?Leslie?s Hippy Lawyer? And we all thought he was pretty cool. But, he was just like the others. He was the first of the retaliation murders. We are all facing the gas chamber! Hey, hey man, what do you think would happen if one night seventy five heads were cut off? Excuse me. You have just judged yourselves! You better lock your doors and watch your own kids! Your whole system?s a game, you blind, stupid people, your children will turn against you! Death! That?s what you?re all gonna get! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight! Your children will rise up, and kill you. Let the night roar because they can hear us! [Alarm going off] [Laughing] Wait a minute! Wait a minute! [Phone ringing] [Unintelligible] What the fuck. You taught him, You taught him! [Answering machine] You?ve reached the offices of crime scene. I?m Jack Wilson. Leave a message. I didn?t teach him, you taught him! [Person leaving message] Hello Mr. Wilson, this is [unintelligible] we?ve have just received a break-in alert on our security system. We?ve dispatched a Police unit to your address and they will be arriving immediately, thank you. You taught him! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Father cares, Father cares. You can tell in his voice he cares. Why you wearing that shirt Todd? Um. This is Charlie. Show Dennis the back. Yeah. Man Dennis has seen this shirt before. No, man I forget, what does that shirt say? What? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Charlie doesn?t surf? C?mon man, let?s get out of here. Let?s go man. I thought you guys knew about this shit? No. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, before Charlie wasted all them people and everything, you know, before they sent him out to the clink, you know, he used to surf. You know, Charlie don?t surf no more, he?s in jail.
