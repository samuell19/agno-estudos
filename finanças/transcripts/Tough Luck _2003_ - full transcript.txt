BRING BACK MY HEART - THAT'LL BE ANOTHER $2.75. ? JUST SAY YOU WILL - ? 'CAUSE I'M GONE... - GET OUT OF HERE! YOU'RE TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRY TO RIP OFF AN OFF-DUTY COP. WAIT A MINUTE, DON'T I KNOW YOU? SON OF A BITCH. WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH, SIR? ARE YOU WITH A PARTY? ARE YOU WAITING FOR SOMEONE? NO, UH-UH. THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE. THE DINING ROOM IS FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY. I'LL ORDER A DRINK THEN. HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING, SIR? CUP OF COFFEE? I'LL HAVE A GLASS OF THE O.G.D. MAKE IT A DOUBLE. THE OLD GRAN DAD. COULD WE JUST KEEP A TAB ROLLING? YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID EARLIER, THAT YOU ONLY HAD THE DIRT THAT YOU'RE STANDING ON? OUR HOTEL IS JUST LOVELY, DARLING. I DO THINK WE MAKE QUITE A PAIR.

SO TELL ME, MELISSA, HOW'D YOU DO IT? - HOW'D YOU FUCK UP MY LIFE? - IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY EXPLAINING IT TO ME THEN? WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO START? HOW ABOUT TWO SECONDS AFTER I LEFT YOU IN THE TRAILER? I LOVE YOU, MONKEY. REMEMBER THAT. YOU ESCAPED FROM THE COPS BEFORE I COULD EVEN FIND YOU. - WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? - I WAS COMING BACK FOR YOU. - YEAH, I BET YOU WERE. - YOU KNOW WHAT THAT CARNIVAL REALLY DOES, DON'T YOU? - NO, I GUESS I DON'T. - NO ONE EVER GAVE A SHIT ABOUT THE RIDES AND THE GAMES. - IT'S A FRONT. - IT'S A FRONT? THERE'S THIS CASINO NEAR BY RUN BY THESE DOMINICAN GUYS. THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH CASH, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. SO THEY FLUSH IT TO THE CARNIVAL. EVERY WEEK THIS GUY SHOWS UP WITH A BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH FOR IKE TO PUT IN THE BANK FOR THEM. THE CARNIVAL'S PERFECT 'CAUSE THEY DEAL IN CASH. EXACTLY. SO WHEN I MET IKE, HE HAD THIS BRILLIANT PLAN. A WAY TO MAKE THE CASH DISAPPEAR WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED. I FELL RIGHT INTO IT. WE JUST NEEDED SOMEONE TO TURN ON THE GAS. YOU REALLY THINK AMU LIKED TO PICK UP CIGAR BUTTS? IKE HAD TO TRAIN THAT THING FOR MONTHS. COME ON, PICK IT UP. PICK IT UP. AMU. SO HOW LONG DID YOU HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE YOU FOUND A SUCKER LIKE ME? IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. I DID CARE ABOUT YOU, ARCHIE. OH, SAVE IT. SO THERE WAS NEVER A BODY IN THE TRAILER. IT'S AMAZING WHAT A PAYOFF TO THE LOCAL CORONER CAN GET YOU. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY HE HAD TO RISK EVERYTHING BY RIPPING OFF THOSE DOMINICANS. THREE YEARS AGO THE DOMINICANS CAUGHT HIM SKIMMING SOME MONEY, THEY CUT HIM STRAIGHT DOWN THE STOMACH TO TEACH HIM A LESSON. IKE MAKES NICE, NEVER HOLDS IT AGAINST THEM, WAITS TILL THE MOMENT IS RIGHT AND THEN PULLS THIS CON IN REVENGE. HE SCREWS THEM ROYALLY AND GETS THEIR MONEY. - AND THEY NEVER FOUND OUT. - FOUND OUT? THEY'RE STILL LAUNDERING 250 THOU FROM THE CASINO THROUGH HIM EVERY OTHER WEEK. RAPHAEL, THIS GUY WHO RUNS THE CASINO, FELT SO BAD ABOUT POOR DIVANA THAT HE SENT IKE A FUNERAL BOUQUET SO BIG THEY HAD TO BRING IT IN A TRUCK. IKE AND I HAD A REAL BIG LAUGH ABOUT IT. THIS RAPHAEL, HE RUNS THIS PLACE, - THE FLAMINGO, IS THAT RIGHT? - YEAH. DO YOU KNOW IT? I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE, YEAH. POOR ARCHIE. I FELT REALLY BAD WHEN I SAW YOU THE OTHER DAY. YOU LOOKED LIKE SHIT. - SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH THIS GUY? - THREE WEEKS. I WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FOR A NICE ROUND NUMBER, BUT I GUESS YOU MESSED THAT UP FOR ME. - THAT'S TOO BAD. HOW ABOUT YOU GIVING ME MY CUT OF THE QUARTER MIL THAT YOU TOOK OFF OF RAPHAEL? IKE ONLY GAVE ME 50,000 AND THEN I HAD A LOT OF FUN, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. - NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. - WHERE'S THE MONEY? - GONE, GONE, GONE. IT'S ALL GONE. WHY DO YOU THINK I'M WASTING MY TIME WITH THIS ASSHOLE? WHAT ABOUT IKE? DOES HE STILL HAVE HIS? IKE'S STILL GOT THE FIRST DIME HE EVER EARNED AND MORE. SO EVERYBODY GOT RICH BUT ME, IS THAT IT? IT'S STAN. MARY? MARY? HEY, MARK. THE BITCH TOOK MY CAR AND SPLIT. NOW SHE'S NOT AT THE HOTEL. MOST OF HER SHIT'S STILL HERE. YEAH. NO. I DON'T KNOW. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I KNOW SOMETHING, OKAY? YEAH. OKAY, BYE. WHAT WAS THAT? I'VE BEEN IN HELL FOR A YEAR THINKING I KILLED YOU. ALWAYS LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER WAITING TO GET BUSTED FOR IT. YOU THINK BY PUTTING YOUR HAND ON MY DICK - YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE ALL THAT? - NO, NO, ARCHIE. I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON AND I WANNA CHANGE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? THE ONLY THAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MORE MONEY. - YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ME ANYMORE. - PLEASE, ARCHIE! WHERE'S MY PURSE? ARCHIE? LAST NIGHT I HAD PREMONITION-- I THINK I AM WITH CHILD. A BABY. HEY, THE BABY IN THE PHOTO-- WHAT'S HIS NAME? EDDIE. HIS NAME IS EDDIE. I THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING HIM AFTER YOU, BUT I COULDN'T DO IT. - YOU'RE A LIAR. - FINE. CAN I HAVE MY PURSE BACK? - WHERE'S THE CASH? - GONE, GONE, GONE. - WHO'S THE KID? - HE'S YOURS. HE'S OURS. I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU, BUT NOW YOU KNOW. - YOU CAN GO SEE HIM IF YOU WANT. - YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S MINE. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE, I SWEAR TO YOU. ARCHIE, HE'S YOUR SON. YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE, FINE, BUT IT IS-- HE'S YOUR KID. - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? - NOTHING. - WHAT KIND OF CON ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL? - NO, NOTHING, I'M NOT! I WOULDN'T LIE ABOUT THIS! PLEASE?! YOU CAN NEVER TRUST ME AGAIN, CAN YOU? - NOPE. - HOW ABOUT FORGIVING ME THEN? LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. IF SOMEBODY MADE YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE IN LOVE WITH YOU, AND THEN THEY FAKE THEIR OWN MURDER AND THEN TRY TO PIN IT ON YOU, WOULD YOU FORGIVE 'EM? YOU EATING THIS? SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE-- NOTHING. ME-- I'M GONNA EAT THIS FOOD. I'M GONNA PAY FOR IT WITH YOUR RICH MARK'S CREDIT CARD IF HE HASN'T CANCELLED IT ALREADY. I'M GONNA GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS POSSIBLE. OH, SHIT. - WHAT? - THERE'S A COP OVER THERE TALKING TO THAT WAITRESS. WHY DON'T YOU TURN ME IN THEN? - YEAH, I'M TEMPTED. - SERIOUSLY. IF YOU HATE ME SO MUCH, TURN ME IN. GET THAT PESKY MURDER SUSPECT THING DROPPED FROM YOUR IMPRESSIVE WARRANT LIST. LET'S JUST GET THE CHECK AND GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S REALLY GET OUT OF HERE-- GO TO CALIFORNIA. START A NEW LIFE WITH OUR SON. AN HONEST LIFE. HONEST LIVES, THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE, RIGHT? RAPHAEL'S GUY STILL BRINGS IKE A CASH DEPOSIT EVERY OTHER FRIDAY. - SOME HONEST LIFE. - KISS ME. THAT WAS NICE. I FELT NOTHING. YOU FEEL NOTHING. YOU HATE ME. YOUR COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT YOUR SON, FINE. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE SOME REAL MONEY HERE AND WE'D BE FOOLS NOT TO TAKE IT. THANK YOU. LOOK, YOU'RE A GRIFT. THERE'S NO LYING ABOUT IT. BUT WE FELT SOMETHING BACK THEN. I KNOW WE DID. AND WHEN I SEE YOU NOW AND I KISS YOU NOW, I FEEL IT AGAIN. LET'S JUST PULL THIS JOB OFF AND WE CAN START FRESH. NO COPS RUNNING AFTER US, NO MORE CONNING PEOPLE... ...BUT WE DID FEEL SOMETHING BACK THEN, I KNOW WE DID. ...YOU, ME, AND A KID, AND A REAL FUTURE... ...AND I KISS YOU NOW I FEEL IT AGAIN.

HOW COME EVERY TIME I SEE YOU I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT TO GET TAKEN? EXCUSE ME, HAVE YOU REPORTED THIS CARD STOLEN? STOLEN? NO, THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. I'M SURE THERE IS. YOU COULD TELEPHONE THEM IF YOU LIKE. - YOU WANT ME TO HANDLE THIS, BUTTERCUP? - IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND DARLIN'. HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU SAY RAPHAEL HAD? WHAT I TELL YOU? RIGHT ON SCHEDULE. WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES. THEY MAKE THE EXCHANGE BY THE FERRIS WHEEL. HEY, HURRY UP. JUST DON'T SOUND THIS NERVOUS WHEN HE GETS HERE. I'M SORRY, BUT I AM NERVOUS. IT'S GONNA WORK OUT. WE'LL GET FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. OKAY. HERE-- HERE WE GO. - LOOKS LIKE IKE'S DOING ALL RIGHT FOR HIMSELF. - YEAH. JUST GET IN THE BATHROOM 'CAUSE HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. JUST MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE A PISS. DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED. HMM? IT'S HIM. GODDAMN IT.
