This is it, your lucky day, you got him. - Sal? - Stoney, I got a Puerto Rican revolutionary wrapped up in dynamite, and a million bucks in machinery ready to go boom any second. Stoney, please. - Sal, I can't do this. Listen, I'm on a plane. Call the bomb squad. - Bomb squad? With what I got in that warehouse? After they arrest him, they'll arrest me. Look, I'm on your way to the airport. What'll it take here? Alright, alright, 20 minutes, $20,000.00 in cash. - Hmm. (upbeat rock music) Right on time, beautiful.

We are temporarily disengaged. - [Gussie] What time is your flight? - Well, I got to stop by Astoria first. I got to do a little job there, and then we'll go to the airport. - Stoney, why are you stopping to play with bullets? You could get shot. - I could miss my plane. - Okay, wiseguy, so what's out in Los Angeles if not the ex-wife? - There's some maniac out there. There's a son of a bitch who threw my friend's granddaughter off a seven story balcony. - And they say New York is crazy. - Come on, get outta here. Come on, get outta here. - [Man] I ain't doing nothing wrong. - Look, get outta here. (tires screeching) You're crazy, you gonna go? Bullshit. Oh, here he is. Where the hell you been? The place could be ashes by now. - Just calm down, will ya? - Calm down, he says. Look, I hope you're sober because this here dude is gonna blow the place up. - I'm like a rock, Sal.

You old, fat, rude (speaking in foreign language). Come up, Sal. I heard you. (speaking in foreign language) - I'd say it looks like a Mexican standoff. - I'm a Puerto Rican, man, and this is real dynamite. - Well, I'm French, German, and Italian, and this is a real gun. - What are you lookin' at, man? - Is that a Japanese plunger? - So what? - (laughing) We're in a lot of trouble. I seen one of those go off in a hostage situation. Accidentally blew some guy's butt to Brooklyn and his mind to Cuba, you know what I'm sayin'? Ya hear me? - No shit? - No shit. - Well, so what, man? I'm gonna die anyways. - Don't you understand the game? You blow this place up, who gives a damn? Sal, he calls the insurance company.

No. (lift whirring) I got to blow this place, man. - Well how about I blow off your balls? - God, man, are you fuckin' crazy with that shit? You oughta be locked up somewhere, man. - You see, dying is one thing but pain is a whole other subject. (gun clacking) I got to tell you what, I'm very sorry that Sal is doin' you wife, but he is paying me to take you outta here whether you're breathing or not. So what do you say you and I make a little deal, alright? How about I pay you, I pay you $2,000.00, and you walk outta here with me hand and hand, and we walk out alive? - Um, $10,000.00, man, huh? $10,000.00. - Four. Top offer, asshole. - Seven. - [Stoney] How much? How much? - Okay, wait. - How much? - Okay. Okay, make it a flat five. (gun clacking) - [Stoney] How much?

I'm gonna get you through this with no sweat. No cops out there, nothing. (crowd cheering) (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat rock music) (speaking in foreign language) There you go, Sal. One wacko complete with dynamite. - Hey, Stoney, goddamit, he's still wired. - Sal, you paid me to get him the hell out, not diffuse him, I'm on a plane. What can I tell ya? (plane whirring) (employee chattering on intercom) (atmospheric synthesizer music) (passengers chattering) Sam, Sam? - Oh, hey, you got, you're early. I didn't expect you. - Yeah. - You got here early, huh? - Yeah. - How are ya? - Good. How was the flight? - Ah, terrifying. - Yeah. - Jeez, you look terrific. - How ya doing? - Fine. - Sam? - Fine. Ah, not so fine. Hey, it's good to see ya. Stoney, thanks for comin', thanks. Here, I'll take your bag. [Employee On Intercom] Please pickup any black courtesy telephone. - [Sam] Did they feed ya on the plane? - [Sam] No, they tried, but I wasn't interested. - [Sam] I got some steaks at home. How was the flight? - Oh, the flight was like a ride from hell. - Can you reach Captain Hoxley? - I wanted to bury her tomorrow, they won't release the body. 16 people this creep kills. 16. Why did they have to pick on my Beverly, why? - Don't do this to yourself. Alright, now look, ah, what's the I.A.P.D. got so far? - Walls, they got. This freak kills anything, men, women, kids, old ladies. Yeah, the whole city's kickin' in. The reward is a quarter of a million bucks. I mean, she was the best. Ever since you left, she's been the only reason I've, I've kept straight. (tires screeching) - Sam. - Goddammit. (tires screeching) - Welcome to I.A. How ya doin', Lopez? That good, huh? (Stoney sighing) - You got a license for this? - Yeah, yeah. - Lock pick, who told you to get out? You still hang around with old cons, Cooper? - You just relax, Sam. Lopez here needs to play his Sergeant Preston routine. - Just walk. - Yeah. - And don't talk. Walk. - Good news travels fast, huh, Lieutenant? - You're not good news. - Right. - And it's Captain. - Captain? Jesus, Hoxley, I'm real proud of ya, that's great. - You broke your word, Cooper. You came back. - Yeah, well let's just, um, let's say this is a condolence call, alright? - Look, the day I took your badge was the last time I ever wanted to see your face. You don't like the way the system works? Well, nothing's changed. We still do things that way. Strictly by procedure. - Strictly by procedure. Well, you're right, Captain, the day you took my badge was the day I stopped playing your system. - You get involved in this investigation, and I'll put you away so far, they'll have to airmail in light. - (laughing) That's a little too far for me, you know what I mean? (dramatic orchestral music) (atmospheric rock music) (tires screeching) - [Otto] This is Captain Hoxley with a code five. Stoney Jackson Cooper is back in town. He's after the X murder reward, stay on him. - So, Sam, let's, ah, let's go to Spring Street, alright? - Stoney, you said you were gonna bunk in with me. Now why do you wanna start that all over again, huh? You know, Eddie said she don't want ya no more. - So how much are you charging for these sessions, Dr. Goodwin? - Oy vey, okay, I'll stop at Spring Street, okay? I'll stop and you'll call her, okay? - No, I'm not calling my own wife. - That was your problem from the beginning, Stoney. If ya got a good woman, ya got to treat her like a queen. Like I did my Harriet, may she rest in peace. You took Eddie for granted and you know it. Today, women want a life of their own. - [Stoney] So do men, Sam. - You should have called first. I'm tellin' ya. Alright, Stoney, I'll park out front. (atmospheric rock music) (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Eddie] Joey was working camera on interview and when we both got back to the station, there was a pink slip waiting for him. - They'll be lots of changes in the news department before they're done. - [Eddie] What are you gonna do? - What is anybody gonna do? - [Eddie] What? - What is anybody gonna do? He owes me money already, you know? - He owes me money, too. And he told me he paid you. (blues piano music) - When's the? - Diego, please don't play with that. It reminds me of my husband. - Oh, Jesus. Stoney, absolutely not. - You kept the Bosendorfer. That's great, Ed. - Great, hell, that's the only thing you left me with more than 10 bucks. - Edwina, I'm gonna head back to the station. I'll call you back later on, and we'll talk about the new format, okay? - Diego, sit down. Stoney was just leaving. - Dayglo? - Diego. - Diego, how ya doin'? Stoney Cooper, Eddie's husband. - Not anymore. - I better get back to the station. I have to help Dave with the tapes. I'll call you back later. - Diego, you don't have to go. - I'm sure you two have a lot to catch up on. Listen, you need company right now. Anyway, I think Ryan's sick, and I have to go on location to run his sound for the 11 o'clock news spot. So I'll call you when I get back. Okay, Edwina? - Edwina? (chuckling) - Stoney, hit the pike. - Um, didn't you get my card? I sent ya a card. You look great, Ed. Did you lose weight? - Stoney, why didn't you sign the divorce papers my lawyer sent you? - So, ah, hi, how are you? What are ya doin'? Are you still writing copy for the 100 thou a year guys? - No, I've graduated. If you'd taken the time to write a letter, you'd know I was now reporting the news. Stoney, what are you doing here? - Jesus, Ed, ah, let's see, um, I came back to I.A. just to see how my old enemies are doin', alright? So how ya doin'? - I'm not your enemy. - No? - I'm not. I just don't like you anymore. Anyway, you came back for X murders. - Ah, number 16, the girl thrown off the balcony this morning, is Sam's granddaughter, Ed. - I know. I tried to call him. - Alright, look, ah, I'd like to visit. The Bosendorfer, huh? What the hell's the matter with you? It's 18 months, Eddie. 18 months, I come by to say goddamn hello. - Where are you staying? You're not staying here, where are you staying? - I don't wanna stay here. I'm staying at Sam's. - Look, Stoney, I stopped being your wife over a year ago. I've got a life of my own and I like it. - Well, that's great - You just can't walk in here and take over again. You can't do that. - Hey. - Look it, you're not super cop anymore. Stoney, I can't go another 10 rounds. - Well, you've fixed the place up, haven't ya? It looks pretty good. - Stoney, please go. - How long you been on this? - Since it started, they assigned it to me, Stoney... - No, wait a sec, why didn't you tell me? Do you have any leads, ah, the guy used the same M.O. or what? - No, sometimes he uses knives, sometimes ice picks, strangulation, I didn't say I'd help you on this. - Didn't say, goddammit. Now this is not for me. (atmospheric orchestral music) This is for Sam. (upbeat rock music) (door thudding against leg) (Stoney screaming) (Stoney groaning) - Shit. (fists thudding against body) (Stoney groaning) - Hey. - Hit him. - Hey! - Cool it, old man. - Mr. Ashley would like you to be a nice guy, get on a nice airplane, and go back to your nice Big Apple, okay? (body banging against wall) (Stoney groaning) (tire iron clanking) (tires screeching) (Stoney groaning) - You wanna throw up? - Yeah. No. Where is my gun? - He threw it in there. (dramatic orchestral music) Now who the hell where those guys? You know them? - Yeah. I had a slight difference of opinion once with their boss. - With their what? - Their boss, Sam. I'll take care of it. (upbeat rock music) - Here ya go. Stoney, thought I should pick the lock. - Sam, I want you to park the car and stay in it, alright? I'll be about 10 minutes. - Alright. (ominous orchestral music) - No, no, no, you, you get back. Back your ass outta here. That's right. Haul it. (upbeat rock music) (man groaning) (man grunting) (man groaning) (dramatic synthesizer music) (ominous orchestral music) - Oh, oh, hello, young man. You must be lookin' for my boy. He's upstairs, first door to the right at the top of the stairs. But I'm not sure he's alone. But I guess it's alright. I'm alone a great deal. When we lived in Albuquerque, I wasn't always alone. (woman groaning on TV) - [Woman] Father once took me to Chicago, and I always remembered that because that's where I met his sister, who crochets so lovely. Have I ever knitted here? Actually he took me maybe once since Paul died. (ominous orchestral music) - Hi. - You a friend of Ashley's. - Intimate. - Would you like me to wake him, sugar? - Very gently. - Ashley, baby. Listen, honey. - Goddamn you, leave me alone. Watch your friggin' movie. (women groaning on TV) (Stoney's lips smacking) - Pussy honey. - You're dead. Don't bother me. - Ashley, old boy, I need a favor. Like you outta my face for three weeks. What do you say? - You must think I'm getting senile. I spent 20 months on that bullshit you called a bust. I owe you some trouble, sweetheart. - Alright, you and I, we stop waltzing right now. Now I need some noise on this X killer. I get the killer, we split the reward. - Shh. - Every badge in I.A. is out lookin'. Hoxley's gonna run for office on this bust. You get in his way, he'll bury you dick deep in elephant shit. - I don't carry a badge anymore, remember? And as you well know, I deliver. - Ya got two weeks. I'll tell my people. Then your sweet little old ass belongs to me. - Terrific. (woman groaning on TV) Nighty, night. - Don't push your luck, Honey. (women groaning on TV) - They're gay. - Whatever turns you on, baby. - Right, goodnight. (upbeat rock music) Find out what you can on his victims. Who's bangin' who, who's important, who's not. We meet a lotta cocks, Sam. Promise 'em money, deals, bribe 'em whatever. It doesn't matter. We got to make some connection fast. (upbeat rock music) - [Sam] It must be someone in sales. - Yeah, well it doesn't stop me from trying, now does it? Look, I still got a few friends on the force, right? - Yeah, well, I wouldn't count on it if I was you. Make a list and leave it on the front door, and I'll try to pick 'em up later. No, I can't leave. I'm here with my friend, Stoney. Stoney, Stoney Cooper from New York City. - Listen, listen, I'm not on the force, you know I'm not on the force. - I can leave here now. - Oh, god. - What? - What, what I'm calling about are the murders that have taken place, Just listen to me, the murders that have taken place. I got Hoxley all over my ass, I got all sorts of stuff. I need whatever you got as soon as possible. I wanna make another stop, Sam. - [Sam] Okay, but that's enough. It's tomorrow already. (speaking in foreign language) (bus engine whirring) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic orchestral music) (Mrs. Hernandez groaning) (speaking in foreign language) - [Diego] N-A-N-D-E-Z. - Okay, do you have where she lives? (speaking in foreign language) - 2224 Alveraro Street. - Otto, I checked the bus schedule. They leave every half an hour. We think he could be here than an hour. - Good. - Tony, Tony. (sirens wailing) (crowd chattering) - Oh, hey, yeah. - Don't touch, don't look. Get on the other side of the police line with the rest of the civilians. - Great. - You grandstand me on this one Cooper, and I'll write a new law. I'll put you away personally. - I told ya I'd be no goddamn problem. Now why don't you just back off, Hoxley. - Who the hell do you think you're talkin' too? Move out! - You. Alright. - Okay, we know she's been through a lot. Could you just ask if she can stick around just for a few minutes, I know. (speaking in foreign language) Please tell here I'm have, - Hi. - Stoney, I'm working. (speaking in foreign language) - Right, what do ya got so far? - Exactly nothing. Diego, could you ask her maybe if we do the interview just against the mural? Just two seconds, that's all it's gonna be, I promise. (speaking in foreign language) Is that alright? - Diego, how ya doin'? - Fine. - Great. (crowd chattering) - Ow, who the, son of a bitch. Stone man. - Jesus, how ya doin'? - Good, how you doin'? What sewer you come up from, badass? - You still working the crowd, aren't ya? - Hey, man, once a picker, always a picker. - Mm-hmm. - You freelancing? - Yeah, I guess, I guess you could say that. Now look at me and tell me what you can tell me about the dead meat over there, and why is it so deep in the barrio? - Hey, man, maybe he come down for some tacos, you know? - Tacos, huh, tacos. Well how much to find out if he liked the food or not? - Hey, man, that didn't happen here. He was dumped on us. - Now you do me a favor, alright? You find out who, when, where, and how. - Alright, I owe you maybe one. - How many? I think you owe me a little more than just one. Wouldn't you say? - Alright, alright, look. - Go on. - I've been hanging out at La Cocina. Catch me there on Friday. Bring the five-o, and I'll see what I can come up with, alright? - You be there. - Yeah. - No, no, you be there. - Alright. - Good to see ya again. (upbeat rock music) - At the end of the dock. I always, always fish there. (video game beeping) - How ya doin', Jerry? - Hey man, how you doin'? I haven't seen you in awhile. - Come on, what do you say you and I go talk? - No, let me finish my game. - No, talk a walk. (upbeat carnival music) - So I want you to take this $10.00. You got my phone number, right? You call me. (waves crashing) - You know who you're afraid of? You're afraid of Hoxley. - Hey, listen. - Yes, everybody's a prick. - [Officer] Listen, he could have my badge. Do you understand that? He can have my badge. - No matter Do you wanna know, first time in my life, I didn't see, but that's why the son of a bitch is after me, and you know it. (upbeat rock music) - [Willie] Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. - [Stoney] Willie, Willie, how ya doin', huh? - [Willie] Hey, wait a minute, my head. - [Stoney] Figured we go on a little joy ride, alright? - [Willie] No, I don't want one, oh, come on. - Now you listen, I'm not gonna bust ya, you got it, huh? Alright, Harry, Harry, come on, look at me. Stoney, I never busted you. I saw Eddie yesterday. - Yeah, has she got anything? - Nothing, nothing but a bunch of crank calls from every crazy in town. Look, let's check La Cocina one more time, alright? - Okay. What we've got so far is exactly zero. - [Stoney] Zero plus one. - Huh? - Jesus. - Who's the old dude? - Hey. - This is my dad. - No shit, you got to a dad? - No shit. Get in. So what do you got? - Alright, chick's name is Maria. Some 20 dollar whore. She works by the train tracks, 6th and Main. The trick's name was Warren Stugo - Don't pay him yet. - Jesus, talk to me. - Hey, man, you asked for a name. What the hell you want? - That's right. - The freaking almanac? - Yeah, I want the almanac. - You want the money? - Alright, look man, word on the street is that she tricked the dead meat and she took him home. Hey, maybe she liked him. - Smart ass. - Come on, come on, it'll only take 10 minutes. Hey. - Hi. - You wanna date good looking? - Well, ah, we were thinking maybe you'd take us both on for $100.00. - Yeah, how are you with miracles? - Well, that's why I work out of the church, baby. Maria can make the dead rise. - Does that mean you will? - Step into my pew, baby. - Come on, Sam. - I'm comin'. - So, Maria, why don't you tell me about Warren Stugo. - Shit, I knew, cops. Come on, guys, I need a break, okay? I don't carve no X - No? - In that dude's head, he paid - You didn't carve no X? - Me $20.00 to go home and watch me change my panties. He don't touch me, I don't touch him. - Maria, tell me about, ah... - [Maria] I swear. - [Sam] So let's go over to immigration. - Oh, no, mi nino! - Wait a minute. - My baby, he's inside. Don't take him from me. (bus engine whirring) (ominous orchestral music) - You got a baby upstairs? - Edward. - You got a baby upstairs? Let's go, let's go see your baby. (dramatic orchestral music) (atmospheric orchestral music) (baby crying) Maria, Stugo was a regular, right? - Couple times. He, he works near here. He pass, I say hello. I got the baby. I got to make a livin'. I don't kill no tricks. - Right, right. You tell me the truth. Did Stugo ever say to you that somebody was after him? Somebody wanted to kill him? And don't, don't lie. - He was a weird guy, you know? He was clean though, he paid cash. No food stamps. Sold cars or something. He never said much. - Right. - He was not important guy, you know? - Look, answer the question. (baby crying) A trip back to Mexico will refresh your memory. - I swear, I don't remember. I don't listen to no tricks. I'm just trying to make a living for my baby. (baby crying) (atmospheric orchestral music) - Let's get outta here, Sam. (baby crying) Excuse me. (singing in foreign language) (dramatic orchestral music) (Maria gasping) (baby crying) (ball thumping) (fire crackling) - Don't start with me. Stoney, you have no right barging in here like this. You said you'd call first. - I just wanna come by and tell ya, you don't ever have to get dressed up for me. - Oh, very funny, I've got a date. - A date? No, come on, we're gonna play some one on one, just like we used to do in the old days, alright? - Forget the old days, Stoney. - Right. Where are you goin'? - I've got a date. A pre-interview dinner date with Joshua Adams at the Canfield Institute. Stoney, don't be here when I get back, alright? - Alright. - [Stoney] Ah, Fats. (meowing) - And make sure the door is locked. - Fats, I did you the best favor of your life when I had you neutered. (atmospheric orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Most of us live the precise life that we are given. Dictated by society, our physical surroundings, our environment, our families. Not realizing that we have the strength to reach inside ourselves, and bring forth the power to change. Will you stand up, sir? And you, ma'am, can you stand up? Thank you. What do you do, sir? - I'm in ladies shoes. (audience laughing) - And you, ma'am? - I'm a court stenographer. - Do you have an arthritic condition, sir? - No. - Why then do you stand like a cripple? Do you realize the signals you're sending? I'm frightened, I'm in pain. You are insignificant, sir. Only because you believe you are insignificant. And what are you going to do about it? And you, ma'am. You have great beauty and you hide it. Everything about you says, I will not succeed. What are you going to do about it? - Find the power. - What power? - The power to change. - What power? - [Audience] The power to change. - What power? - The power to change. - What power? - [Audience] The power to change. - What power? - The power to change! (atmospheric piano music) (Stoney sighing) (dramatic orchestral music) (atmospheric piano music) (dramatic orchestral music) (machine gun firing) (bullets ricocheting) (dramatic orchestral music) (machine gun firing) (bullets ricocheting) (machine gun firing) (bullets ricocheting) (police siren wailing) - [Eddie] Stoney was the only one who was surprised when his grandstanding got him busted from the force. It became impossible to live with someone who's separated. - [Joshua] Were there other women? - [Eddie] I don't think so. I'm supposed to be interviewing you and you're getting my life story. - [Joshua] Maybe that's because listening is a lost art. In my profession, I have to be good at it. - Really? Listen, I do have a few questions. It says here in your biography that you appeared out of nowhere, and founded the Canfield Institute on a shoestring. Then you became one of the driving forces in the success training field. Where is nowhere, exactly? (atmospheric classical music) - Nowhere is where everybody is from until they become somebody, and then they're allowed by precedent to lie about their origin. - So you still know more about me than I know about you. - You're far more interesting. And maybe this air of mystery will rate me another interview. - I hope so. (upbeat rock music) (glass cracking) (door clacking) (atmospheric piano music) Well, what the hell happened here? (atmospheric piano music) (piano lid banging) - Somebody tried to kill me. - Don't look at me. Though it's crossed my mind. You'll live. - Would you say I'm on to something? - You can't live like this again. I cannot live like this again. - Again, I'm out on the streets, this wacko knows I'm lookin' for him. I got him scared, goddammit, I got him scared, and so what does he do, he follows me here. I'm sorry about the loft, alright? - How many people in this town would like to see you dead? Maybe more than 10, hmm? More than 100? (Stoney groaning) Huh, how many? - Only Ashley. Only Ashley. And he doesn't have the guts. Rub a little lower. - Stoney, stop it. - What? - Stop it, just stop it. - How can I? - [Eddie] Stoney. - Stoney. - Stoney. - I'm not. - Okay, fine. - I wouldn't think of it. - No. Don't come near me. (towel snapping) Gone mad? Stop, come on. - [Stoney] No, you come on. Oh, god.

Why don't you children go do that some place else. Scaring people like that. Go now. (Janine screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) (body thudding on stairs) (Janine gasping) - Here name was Janine Strand. Maid at the hotel. What the hell is going here? (camera shutters clicking) Get a security guard - Come on. - Down here right now. - Move 'em back, back, I told you to move back. - Get back, move it back. - [Man] We got ya. - [Officer] Back, move it back. - Mrs. Hooper. (siren wailing) Now, I understand we had a shooting at your place. - I know, the city's not safe anymore. - Yeah, well I want you to tell your glory boy that he has warn out his welcome in a very short time. - Why is going from a black and white to a gold badge in four months make him a glory boy, Captain? I think it makes him the best cop you've ever had in your department. - You just tell him that I'll have a warrant out for his arrest in 48 hours. - Maybe you hate him for doing what you couldn't do yourself. - Not couldn't, Mrs. Cooper, wouldn't. There's a difference. If you can't be his wife, at least be his friend. Have him on the plane tomorrow. - If I get him out of town, can I have a story on this one? - She's dead. - Come on, people, I told you before, - You're a real charmer, Hoxley. - There's not gonna be any news here. - A real charmer. - [Man] Come on, Lucas, just wait till she's here, come on. - Come on, come. (crowd chattering) - Listen, Hoxley said we could shoot this. It's alright. - He did? - Yeah. (crowd chattering) Come on, Diego, I got to pull this one off. Let's go, hurry. - Don't do that again. (camera clinking) - I'll make a deal with you. I give you what I got for what you got. Deal? - I don't have that much. Stugo is a car salesman. Lived alone, he had no police record. He had his barbering license, but I don't think he practiced. Janine Strand, she was a night maid at the Bonaventure Hotel last six years, but her husband is Soledad Prison serving 20 years for armed robbery. She's clean. I got not motives. I got nothing. - Ed, do you know what's wrong? What's wrong is this whole thing is random. It's, it's scattered. Now these psychos use patterns. That's how they talk to the world. So look, maybe our crazy isn't as crazy as we thought. I mean, maybe this guy just wanted some of the victims killed. - [Eddie] So he killed off all the rest just to cover his tracks, is that what you're saying? - Absolutely. I mean, look at it, it makes sense. He's throwing everybody off, nobody knows where to look. - I've been through every file with a fine-toothed comb. - Well then here's what we do, dammit. We start at the beginning, alright? We get, um, perfect, we get Sam to break into Hoxley's office, and rip off the files on every victim and suspect they drug in since day one. (phone buzzing) - Alright, excuse me. Hello? - Deborah Rondo. - Yeah, put her on. - [Deborah] You remember me? - Yeah, Deborah, sure I remember you. - [Deborah] I have to talk to you. - [Eddie] Can you talk now? - [Deborah] I called earlier, you didn't answer. - Well, wait a minute, I, I wasn't in. - Ms. Cooper, I can't talk now. I left you a message. - What message? - Meet me - Debbie, don't hang up. - At the security office at the Hollywood Pacific Studios. - Meet you where? - Please. (dial tone ringing) - Wow, damn. - Who was that? - Wanna come with me? - Terrific. Where? (upbeat rock music) - Deborah? Deborah Rondo? She's not here. - Perfect. I'm gonna take a look around. - Wait a minute, Stoney, wait a minute. - [Stoney] No, look, you wait in the car. - Why don't you wait in the car? - Ed, listen. - I'm the reporter and this is my story. - Story. - Now I'm gonna see if I can find her. - You and your goddamn stories. Ed? - Deborah? Whoa, Stoney, look at this. - Oh. - Stoney. (ominous orchestral music) Hey, sailor, are you new in town? (furniture scraping) (ominous orchestral music) - Maybe it's Deborah, maybe it's not, but somebody's here. Who's there? Wait here. (cat meowing) (Eddie shrieking) - Tony, I'm sorry, it was just a cat. (dramatic orchestral music) (Stoney grunting) (body thudding against sign) (Stoney groaning) (upbeat rock music) (board whacking against body) (Harvey groaning) (Eddie gasping) Ah, Stoney? (board thudding against legs) (Stoney groaning) (body banging down stairs) (Stoney groaning) Stoney? (Stoney groaning) Stoney, are you alright? Stone, ah. Stoney, please help me. - Eddie? - Please, Stoney. Oh, thank god, help me, please. - [Stoney] Come on, climb over me. - Oh, Stoney, Stoney. - Alright, come on, Eddie. - Oh, she's dead. - Come on! No, no, don't lose him now, we got him. (upbeat rock music) (car engine whirring) (car revving) (Stoney screaming) (gun firing) (Eddie yelping) Hang on. And stay down. (tires screeching) (car bashing through gate) (tires screeching) - What about Deborah Rondo lying back there in the net? - I don't think she's in a traveling mood, you know what I mean? (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (cars bashing against each other) (tires screeching) (gun firing) - Stoney, you're not a cop anymore. - I don't need a badge. I hit him. (tires screeching) (tires screeching) Look, he's weaving all over the road. I told ya I hit him. - Why don't the cops just handle this? - Right, like they handled it so far? You know, goddammit, Eddie, I take it very personally when somebody tries to kill me. Where did he go? I lost him. (upbeat rock music) - There he is, Stoney. Oh, my god. That's the Canfield Institute. - Shit. (horn beeping) (horn beeping) - Okay, see you next Tuesday. (horn beeping) (horns beeping) (sculpture banging against car) - You're under arrest, Mister. - I just chased the X murderer over your wall, alright? You wanna relax? - Joshua. - Come on. - Eddie? What happened, what are you doing? - No, no, come on. Get these people back, alright? You got the X murderer loose on your property. - I'll call the police from the house. Come inside. - [Man] Everybody just go to your cars. (ominous orchestral music) - This is incredible. Do you always run around the streets at night finding dead bodies? - (chuckling) Only with my husband. - Dynamic personalities always attract trouble. (crickets chirping) He's a lucky man to have a wife so well suited to his extremes. - He's not, and he doesn't, thanks. - Here. (Eddie sighing) (crickets chirping) (brick scraping) (brick shattering) You stay here, Eddie. (ominous orchestral music) (gun cartridge clacking) (Harvey groaning) (upbeat rock music) (Eddie screaming) - No. (gun firing) (dramatic orchestral music) - I didn't have time to think, I just, just fired. - It's alright, it's alright. - I heard her cry out, I came into the room, he was standing over her. I just fired without thinking. This is horrible. (ominous orchestral music) (lock clacking) - Garbage they put in. - Funny, I told you he might have been missing a finger or two. Always the same hand. Never two full sets of prints. - [Officer] Captain Hoxley? - Those two, it's for real. - Let's just, ah, let's get outta here, alright? - I can't leave. Harvey Benton murdered 20 people. I wanna know why. This is important to me. What's the matter with you? It's the reward, isn't it? You're all bent out of shape because you didn't capture him. Right? Right? (atmospheric rock music) - Hey, let me tell you something. I put six months in on this case, you walk in with your fuck you attitude, and think the reward money is yours. Well, I got news for you. My report says the reward money goes to Joshua Adams. - Alright. - Hey, by the way, I understand there's a certain scumbag hood who might be a little pissed off about some reward money you promised him? Well, that's too bad, Cooper. If you think you have a problem, why don't you call a cop? - Who's the scumbag Hoxley was talking about? - Ashley Maynard, you remember ole Ashley? - What'd you do to him this time? - I didn't do nothing. I made a deal with the guy. Everything's fine. He might be a little upset when he finds out about the reward money, but I can handle the guy. - Got him. - Ah, god, no. (upbeat rock music) (tires screeching) Hoxley called Ashley Maynard, goddammit. (tires screeching) I can't lose him, Eddie. Get down, honey. - He's gaining on us. - Get down. You me two weeks, Maynard. - Times up, boy. (gun firing) (Eddie yelping) (gun firing) - Stoney! - I'm gonna hit the son of a bitch, just hold on. Get down goddammit. - Okay, cowboy, You did me one time, Cooper, but you ain't gonna do me again. - Eddie, would you get down, goddammit. - Damn you. - We're gonna lose him over the bridge, you understand? Come on baby, don't fail me now. (tires screeching) (gun firing) - Goddammit. (gun firing) - Stay down, duck. - Got ya, Cooper. You don't even know where you're going. - This is crazy. Stoney, no, we're not gonna make it. We're not gonna make it. - We're going to make it. (Eddie screaming) (horn blowing) (cars smashing) (horn blowing) My god, Sam, did you look through the lens when you shot this stuff? - Who had time? I found, I took, I left to find an all night photo lab. What's the difference, the guy's dead you said? I wish I could get my hands around his neck. Hey, what's bothering you? - Heartburn. - Well, here take a swig. - Come on, Sam, the damn thing's too easy. It's too simple. I mean, a guy takes a shot in the skull, police get prints up the kazoo, everything matches, everything's great in the world, and I feel like run over dog shit, I'm sorry. - Here, take a swig, I'll tell ya, it'll help. - I don't want it. (door clacking) - Don't listen to him, Sam. When he gets in his moods, he's totally hopeless, here. - No, no, look, look, when that guy was climbing over the wall, you didn't see the look in his eye. To me, it didn't look like he was running somewhere. It looked like he had already got where he wanted to be. - What for? It was a little too late for success training. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Why would a guy run to public grounds with security guards? - Hey, what's with you two? - Unless Joshua Adams was Ben's next victim. - Oh, no, that's good. That's good. Alright, what else? Here. Working man, Warren Stugo. Janine Strand, husband's doing 20 years in Soledad. - Harvey Benton, former guard at Soledad Prison in '67 through '72. - There's been 10,000 people in prison since Benton was a guard there. - Okay, Sam, what else? - Well, listen to this. - What the hell is the matter with Hoxley? Stugo, Benton, the hotel maid's husband. We got three known connections to Soledad. There are probably more we don't even know about. - So maybe Hox is already working on it. - Working on it? You know what that guy's working on? He's running for councilman. - So? - So, ah, first thing in the morning, we go to Soledad. - Oh, yeah? - Wait a minute, I wanna go. - [Stoney] No. - Stoney, it could be a story. - You are a story. (atmospheric orchestral music) (atmospheric rock music) - Soledad prison. - I never wanted to see that place again. - [Stoney] Well, I never wanted to be in airplane again, but it's the only lead we got. I just hope Lester Strand feels like talking. (bars clanking) (bars clanking) - I smell cop. You're an old con. That's easy. What ya want? - How ya doin'? - My time. I asked you, what do you want? - I just want the son of a bitch who killed her, Lester. - We got TV. They got the dude that stabbed Janine. He was a screw in here. - Suppose it wasn't him? - Say what? - What if they got the wrong guy, Lester? Talk to me about Warren Stugo. Stugo. - White dude, civilian. He cut hair in here when they shived Mickey the barber. - Same guy that killed him killed your wife. - People dying all the time. - Ain't it the truth. - Yeah. - Harvey Benton. - (sighing) The dude was a screw, '70. '71. Didn't like him, but that ain't no reason to kill Janine. - Come on, Lester. Tell me something I don't know. - Benton got to be buddies with a con called Fulton. Said he's the cat, he had kind of his own machine. Warden even left him alone. Said he'll make model cons out of all the hard asses, see? - So this Fulton, he was, ah, the jailhouse preacher, right? - Oh, hell no, man. I mean, the dude had control, had screws running errands. Crap like that. If you didn't cop to his program, like cleaning up the cells, go into the library, one night, one of his boys visit you. And zip. - I can't believe that cons would let him stay alive. - Yeah, we got to his ass one night. Poured 200 proof grains and it blew all over him. Lit up like a Christmas tree. Benton split right after that. Couple of cons were transferred. That's it. - No, no, no, that's not it. You recognize anybody else there? - Goin' blind in here. - Right. - [Lester] Yeah, that's Warren the barber. - [Stoney] Right. - [Lester] That's the old dude that used to come down from Salinas. You know, do the plumbing around here. - [Stoney] Mm-hmm. - That's Janine, poor broad. Marrying me. - Anybody else? - No man, that's it. - Are you sure? - Look man, I don't know nobody else. - Yeah. (knocking on gate) - Open up. - Hey, Lester? I am sorry about your wife. (ominous orchestral music) - Fulton. - He's dead. - I know, but I'm still interested. Look, we got to have more. Sam? - Yeah? - You got any friends left up here? - Sure, where they gonna go? (keys jangling) - [Jack] Where the hell did you guys get this stuff? - Oh, the world is full of thieves, Jack. No, he's wrong, let's see Fulton. Okay, now the composite, Jack. Alright, lose the beard and the mustache. - [Jack] Alright. - And give me a chin. - There you go. - No, no, More square. - How's that? - Good. - Alright, now let me see some hair. No, no, no, bushy, bushy. - Okay. - Wavey, more forehead, you know? - Bushy. There ya go. - Goddamn. (ominous orchestral music) (chuckling) He is good. Sam, 10 more years of lines on that face and who do you have? - [Sam] That son of a bitch. - Adams. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Sam] A little more drink, a little less ice. Stoney. Well, I called the station, and they said that Eddie is on some kind of assignment in the cornfields. So what do you wanna do? March this stuff in to Hoxley. - Hell, no. Eddie gets this story. - You sure you're ready for this after last night? - We need a script ready for tomorrow's on camera interview. I'm fine, thank you. Thank you for asking, it's more than some people did. - 'Cause what we got so far is Adams is Fulton, right? - Right. - But Fulton is dead. A con gets a release ticket signed by guard, Harvey Benton, who checks out a burned body, you follow? - Sure, I follow. - Now, the next day he quits his job at Soledad Prison. 10 years pass, 10 years, Sam. - Yeah. - Joshua Adams got a thriving business, but a lot of people who knew his prison identity are starting to turn up very dead, right? And innocent people are dying also in order to throw the cops off. It's simple. - Discover that power in you. Convince yourself and you convince others. (recorder beeping) - Oh, excuse me. Sorry, electronic reporting. - Listen, we better get you to bed. Give me the keys, I'll drive. - Alright. What we'll do is, ah, we'll wait for Eddie to get back from the cornfields, put this whole thing together, put a cherry on top, and get it to Hoxley. I cannot wait this man's face. Hey, Sam? - Yeah? - It's not cornfield, it's Canfield. She's at Canfield. (upbeat rock music) - Well he doesn't know anything, she'll be alright. - Are you kidding, with her mouth, she probably told him we were at Soledad. Get in. (upbeat rock music) - You admire strength, don't you? - Yes, I do. I admire strength, not necessarily the physical type. - Like your husband? - Sometimes he over machos it, like you're doing right now. But this morning he had this wild, brilliant hunch, and he took off without me like I was some idiot child that couldn't play in adult world. - Which you certainly are not. You're wonderful, Eddie. (glasses clinking) - Cheers. (dramatic synthesizer music) - [Stoney] Come on, come on. Alright, you go first. Jesus, get in. - Alright. (groaning) - Shh, there's a guard. (upbeat rock music) (guard groaning) (Stoney grunting) (Stoney grunting) (guard groaning) - [Sam] I'm gonna take his gun. (upbeat rock music) - Come on, goddammit, Sam. - It's a tough one. - Everybody lies for a good cause. Women lie when they put on makeup. Churches lie when they offer salvation. Prisons lie when they promise rehabilitation. - Well that's a very strange analogy. Were you ever in prison? - We're all in prison, Eddie. That's why my seminars are so successful. (chairs clattering) - [Stoney] Shh. - It's alright. I'll be right back. (dramatic synthesizer music) (door clacking) - Get ready. - Mr. Cooper. Why didn't you ring the night bell? It's alright, Marty. I'm sorry, I haven't had the pleasure, Mr.? - Sam. - Sam. Tell me, was it necessary for you to break in? Or did you think that Eddie was in some sort of danger here with me? - Stoney, I don't believe this. I could just kill you for this. - I mean, here she is doing her job, and there you are acting the fool. - Oh, no, he's not acting. What are you two doing here? - What are we doing here? Ah. - Yeah. - Mr. Adams, this is kinda personal, you understand? I just need a minute with my wife alone. - Stoney, would you just leave, please? Just leave. - Now why don't you just come over here, talk to me, before I break your arm. - Excuse me, Joshua. - Thanks. Now, you're gonna listen to me for the first time in your goddamn life. What we are gonna do is apologize to Adams, and then you, Sam, and I are gonna walk the hell outta here, alright? - Alright. - No, no, no arguments. I'll explain. - Right, just like that I'm supposed to forgive - Eddie, trust me. - And forget. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at Soledad Prison till tomorrow. - Terrific. (dramatic orchestral music) - Stoney? Just go. - Now I don't think Mr. Fulton would like us to leave right now, would you Roger? - I'm sorry, but this is breaking and entering. I'll have to have that gun. - Stoney, what are you doing? - Shut up, Ed. - You're behaving irrationally, Mr. Cooper. There's a guard behind you, and there's another one in back of your friend. - Would somebody just please tell me what's going on here? Sam, what's going on here? I don't get it. - He's Roger Fulton. - Who's Fulton? - Roger Fulton died in prison. - No, no, no, somebody died, but it sure as hell wasn't you, was it? - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist on that gun. This is my house and I have a right to protect it. (upbeat rock music) - I feel sick. (ominous synthesizer music) - Marty, I think you should relieve Mr. Cooper of his gun. (dramatic orchestral music) And check his friend, too, please. Marty, take the goddamn gun. - Go on, make one step, Marty, and I'll blow a whole in this man's head the size of a cantaloupe. (dramatic orchestral music) - It's academic. The jealous husband breaks in, shoots his wife, one of my men shoots him. - How do you explain Sam? - Sam gets to go home and go to bed. - Sam, is an accomplice, of course. - My god, you are smooth, aren't you? - Now put the gun down. - You're busted. - Do it. - Duck! (gun firing) (light socket zapping) (guns firing) (upbeat rock music) (Eddie gasping) - [Eddie] Oh, my god. - You had no right resurrecting Robert Fulton. - God! - I put too much hard work into killing him off. (Eddie screaming) - Sam, you okay? - Yeah, I should go look for a phone? - No, phones, I want this scumbag for myself. - He's got Eddie. - He's got me, Sam. I'll make him a trade, you stay right there. (upbeat rock music) Fulton? - It's exciting to kill, isn't it? Especially a little at a time. How many people have you killed, Stoney? 10, 20, more than the X murderer? How will you feel when you kill your own wife? (gun firing) - Stoney! (Eddie yelping) - I'm a very good shot, (Eddie crying) Stoney. (Eddie crying) Don't think I didn't hit my aim before. (ominous synthesizer music) (Eddie crying) (Stoney groaning) (Eddie yelping) (upbeat rock music) (body thudding on ground) (Eddie groaning) (gun firing) A quick reaction. I like a good adversary. (Eddie gasping) It's not gonna make me happy to see Eddie die, though. Such a waste of a classic woman. - You sick bastard. Either way you look at it, you're dead meat. - Please, Stoney, no police idioms. They make you sound unintelligent. Now! (gun firing) (man groaning) (Eddie screaming) - Good shot. You play well. We could pull on this all night, Stoney. It's very private here. (gun firing) (bullet ricocheting) (Eddie gasping) Think of how little there'll be left of you, and what I'll be doing with your wife after you're dead. (gun firing) (Eddie yelping) (Joshua laughing) (Eddie crying) (upbeat rock music) - Stoney! Stoney! - [Joshua] (laughing) Come and get her, Stoney. - Come on, Fulton. It's just you and me. Come on, genius. You can put on your thousand dollar suit, do you hear me? Go to your fancy parties, and ass kiss society, but you're never gonna be one, you hear me? You're never gonna be one of 'em. Well, you got the cards, deal 'em. - You'll come around when you understand the program. (ominous synthesizer music) You see, once the Canfield Institute was created, certain key people had to be eliminated. You can see the reasoning, can't you? - Where's my wife? Where is she? Are you okay? Don't worry, alright? I'm gonna make a deal, right? - We're two of a kind, Mr. Cooper. We understand the use of violence as a means to an end. Now give me your gun. Do it. (dramatic synthesizer music) (guns firing) (Eddie gasping) (Joshua grunting) (Joshua screaming) (bodies thudding on floor) (upbeat rock music) - Oh, Stoney, Stoney, no. Come on. - No! Goddammit. Just help me or leave me alone. (Stoney groaning) (tires screeching) (body thudding against car) (Stoney screaming) - Stoney! (tires screeching) Oh, my god, oh, my god. (tires screeching) (gun firing) (trunk exploding) (tires screeching) Whoa! (car rumbling) (car exploding) (car exploding) (Eddie gasping) (Eddie crying) (fire roaring) (sirens wailing) - [Officer] Okay, I'll get Officer Moore, and see if we can see who's down there. - Cooper? - You cannot leave that dead body there. - I'll put him over there. - [Hoxley] Cooper, where do you think you're going? - Anybody wanna go with Hoxley? - I wanna get you to a hospital. - Sam? - I'm hungry. - [Hoxley] What happened here? - [Stoney] Alright, let's pick up the reward, take and ambulance to Baja and fish for margaritas. (Eddie laughing) - [Hoxley] That's it, glory boy. Your final warning. (Eddie laughing) You're not going anywhere until I find out what happened here. (Eddie laughing) You leave I.A. and I'll have your ass. - [Stoney] Oh, shut up, Hoxley.
