He do it again, then go away. And he's not come back. Sure. Then what are you squawking about? Who is this Giuseppe? Giuseppe is my husband. He punched me too. Where is he now? He is a cripple in the hospital. How could a cripple do all this damage? When Giuseppe do this, he is no cripple. The only way to keep this phone on the wall is to put barbed wire on it. Telephone Company. Where's the phone? I'll bite. Where is it? - We'll both bite. Where's the phone? Oh, the phone? - Yeah. In there. - Right. Come on, Johnny. Telephone company. I hope we didn't disturb you ladies. The answer to a maiden's prayer. You know them? No. But we will. What do you want besides a longer cord? I'd take a stein of gin. Make mine a Filipino house boy. Now they're comics. How long you want the cord? So it reaches the bed. Let's get out of here. You get it, Johnny. Anything else we can do for you girls? - You ought to know. Let's get out of here. What's the matter with your boyfriend? Scared or scarred? I'll tell you, sister. When he's excited he likes to strangle little girls. So he keeps his hands on his own throat. On the other hand I'm a good example of .. My mother told me to follow good examples. Yeah? Alright, sister. But when I fool around I'm not fooling. We need excitement. All you're going to get is a longer cord. And here it is. Let's get out of here. So long, chickadee. Plant service foreman. Just a minute. Just a minute. Let me get this thing straight. Now, who insulted who? I'm accustomed to being treated like a lady. No-one is going to slap me on the .. Was his name Terry? Did he have an Irish pan? I see. Thank you very much, lady. I'll take care of him. Hiya, boys. Well, the board of directors can now come to order. Sure. The president and vice president have just arrived. Comics. Comics everywhere. Hello Terry. Hiya, Mac. Hi, Terry. Hello, Happy. I got something this time. It's big. Yeah? How much does it weigh? - No fooling. Wait until you see. You're a businessman with a battery of phones. The phone rings and you don't know which one. Sure. I can't sleep nights worrying about it. Both phones have an arm extension. The phone rings. It comes out. Right smack into the businessman. Ring that bell. And watch. Right smack to the businessman is right. We'll invest in that patent. I guess something went wrong. Hey. Hello, bright-eyes. What are you so happy about? Come in here. Shut that door. You've got away with this long enough. I've warned you I won't stand for it. Wait a minute. Getting away with what? What's wrong? Some dame phoned in and said you slapped her on the .. Oh, that. Yeah. Oh that. So what? That was purely an accident. How could it be an accident? I was going to slap her on the shoulder and she bent over. The next time you have an accident you'll be without a job. You are more trouble to me than a skinful of fleas. You ought to know. From now on, you get every dirty job that turns up. 'From now on'? You lay awake at night thinking up new ones for me. Up to now I've just been playing. Right, sweetheart. But no slips. When I'm president I'll remember the tricks you pulled on me. Oh yeah? When you get one promotion I'll be in my grave. Now, Joe. Don't give me any ideas. [ Telephone ] Plant service foreman. There is a 3-Alarm fire. It's near Courtland Street power plant. Right. I'll shoot some men down there. So long, chief. - Hold on, you. There is a job for you. Get Adams and your truck and beat it to the Courtland Street power plant. It's a 3-Alarm. Our cable is in danger. And try slapping some of those firemen down there. Mister Flood. Come on, Johnny. A fire call. A 3-Alarm. Hurry back, Terry. And don't get your feet wet. Hey, Johnny. - What? I'm going up top to cut those wires. You drive round and pull them in. - Okay. Right. Is this your car? - Yes it is. Well, get it out of here. Come on. Hurry it up. That's a live wire. Don't touch the metal. Don't touch that metal. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. Stand away. I'm going to cut it. He's going to cut the wire. Everything is alright over there. Look. He's trapped. Get ready with that net. Get in position. Thanks boys. Come on, fellows. Over here. Swell work, son. I imagine I owe you a little more than just thanks. Part of my work, buddy. Nevertheless, I am grateful. My name is Schuyler. Here's my card. Any time I can help you, look me up. Anything at all. - Investments, huh? Okay, buddy. Any time I want any advice on investments I'll drop in to .. Into your net. Let's get out of here. Alright. So long, Schuyler. - So long. And on behalf of the telephone system. It gives me great pleasure to award you this tribute. I personally will write the citation which goes into our records. Thank you, Mr Madison. Don't you want to say a word or two, Joe? Yep. A great piece of work, Terry. Thank you, Mr Flood. We are proud of you, Terry. Keep up the good work, boys. Too bad you didn't miss the net. I personally would like to write your epitaph. Hello? Hello Terry. Special order 4250. Madison 44107. At 440 Madison. A mystic joint has hooked up an unauthorised attachment to the phone. Take it. Yeah. Say. How is the medal? Well, keep it polished. Please join hands under the table. Now think only of the dear departed. Of the chance they will talk to you. Through the medium of the sacred horn. Which brings voices from the cosmic world. Concentrate. And I will attempt to reach the first. Of the dear departed ones. This is the joint alright, Johnny. Speak, spirits. Speak. I am happier in the other world, Elsie. Than I ever thought I could be. I am watching and guarding over you. Be advised by Madam Francis. She is a friend of yours and mine. I told you it wasn't on the level. Get a load of that. I am now communing with the spirit of Minnie Hellman. Minnie. Are you there? Here, Crystal. You take this one. This is Minnie. How is you, Sarah? Sure I miss you, honey child. Madam Francis calls to me every morning about you all. Minnie. Darling. Why do you speak with a southern accent? Well, you see Sarah. I lives in the southern part of heaven. And we sing spirituals all day long. We will now try to get a message for Mrs McPherson. From her dear third husband. Listen. Listen. Spirit of Sandy McPherson. Will you talk to your beloved wife? Alright. I'll speak to you. And I'm not Sandy McPherson. As a matter of fact this is a phony and you are all a bunch of saps. Those voices come over the telephone wires and I'm coming in to prove it. I want my three dollars back. All the time I knew it wasn't Minnie. Let's not go in there. It's too smoky for going in there. Get me one of those phony attachments. It looks like we busted up the joint. I wonder where the madam is. Perhaps on her way out of town. I sure would have liked to have had a peek at the madam. I suppose you are the spirit of Sandy McPherson. I was, but I changed characters. Now I am Houdini. What do you mean, busting up my seance? - It was getting awful dull. I can have you arrested for forcing your way in like that. Yes again, sister. The door was open and we walked in. What's he doing? - Taking out the phone. You're from the phone company? Sister, I am the telephone company. Why pick on me? Well, how did I know it was you? Let's get out of here. How about a drink? No. That's not allowed. You never break rules? - We got one rule. The subscriber is always right. Then you will have a drink. Wait a minute. What other tricks do you pull around here? I'm also a mind reader. Sister, If you could read my mind right now you'd throw me out of here. Want me to give you a reading? You can give me anything you want but the phone still comes out. I'd like to show you my crystal. When did you last hear of Terry? Not long ago. Let's see his card. An hour and a half ago? Yes. Something must have held him up. More than likely. Let me have your headphones. No, no. That one. What is that bump right there? There? - Yeah. That's a peculiar formation of the cranium. Indicating an absence of feeling. For those in distress. You see, you are wrong again. That's the result of a peculiar piece of lead pipe. Believe me, it had plenty of feeling. [ Telephone ] I thought Johnny took that out. - That's another one, darling. That means more work for us. Hello? Yes. Huh? Yes. Just a minute. It's for you. - Me? It's getting so they can't run the company without me. Hello. Since when does it take an hour and a half to take out a phone? What are you doing down there? Finding something else to slap? Joe, old horse. I've already found it. You get in here and get in quickly. Or you're through. Through. Fired. Canned. Do you understand me? Remember, Mr Flood. I won a medal. Medal or no medal. You get in here in ten minutes or you're washed up. Here is your hat, big-shot. Keep in touch, little-shot. Business is business. It appears to me that you is in the path of a lot of calamity. And your death line looks awful sharp. Looks like trouble all over your hand. Ah, Crystal. Ain't my luck ever going to change? What do you think? Come on, little boy. Goodbye, Johnny. - Goodbye. Hello, Nicky. I found this wandering around a drugstore. It's got your name on it. What is it about me you find so irresistible? That's a long, long story, beautiful. But there is one thing about you. Don't tell me. Please. Want to help out with a gag? - Sure. Come here. Take care of the board, will you. - Okay. What? George Talley in 419 is a pal of mine. He'll get a call at 2 o'clock. When it comes switch it to me instead of Talley. What's the pay-off? The dame he met last night will call him up. I want to kid her and watch him take a burn. And me a jealous woman. I wish you were. Marie. Hurry up. I'm swamped. - Alright. Wait a minute. You'll help out? - Sure. Anything for a laugh. Swell. You sure that operator won't cross you? - Don't worry. She won't. Operator. There is no answer. Alright. Hotel Eden. Mr Talley? Just a moment please. [ Telephone ] Hello? This is Talley speaking. Okay. Red Gold in the fifth. Come on you mugs. Step on it. The information can only have leaked out through the hotel. Either the switchboard girls misdirected the call or my wire is tapped. There must be some mistake, Mr Talley. The girls have been with us for quite some time. As for your wire being tapped. You sent for me, sir? Yes. This is Mr Talley, Marie. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock Mr Talley expected a telephone call. Evidently someone intercepted it. It's caused Mr Talley a great loss. You know anything about it? I take hundreds of calls a day, Mr Stevenson. It's impossible to remember all of them. You are evading. Someone paid you to transfer my call. That's not true. - Don't lie to me. Mr Talley. Please. Could Loretta have taken that call? No, sir. If it came in at 2 o'clock I took it. Thank you, Marie. That will be all just now. Well, is that all you intend doing about it? I'll make a thorough investigation later. In the meantime we'll have the telephone company examine your extension. They should be able to tell whether it's been tapped. If it hasn't. I promise you that Miss Lawson will be discharged. Get me the chief operator. Hiya, sister. They say you or the switchboard went haywire. Just a minute. Looks like Terry will have to fix your connections. Try examining the back of the board. Johnny, run upstairs and take care of that end. I'll knock this off. Someday we'll get a call where there ain't no dames. It may take years and I may be an old guy with a beard. But we're going to get it. Where's 623? Next to 622. No kidding. I suppose 624 is next to that? Odd, isn't it? - Remarkable. Whoever built this was a mathematician. - Where did you get that big word? Anyone would think you don't like me. I don't like fresh figs either. - Alright, duchess. I grow on people. So do carbuncles. One for the duchess. I see you're happy. She has you laughing all the time. Don't mind her. She's been upset lately. Usual trouble with good-looking dames. A guy always comes along and upsets her. I resent that. Gee, I think he's cute. So are hippopotamuses when they're babies. Hotel Eden. Hotel Eden. Operator. I'll get you the room, sir. Hotel Eden. Number please? Hotel Eden. Can you give me a room and a bath? I'll get you the room clerk. I don't want a clerk. I want a bath. The room clerk will attend to you, sir. I'm old enough to attend to myself. And it's Saturday night. This is Cornelius McSwaggle. Will you give me a bath? Just testing. I had a kid brother like you once. He was an idiot so we drowned him. Hotel Eden. How about a date tonight? No. Leave me alone. Give me a date tonight. Listen, nitwit. Will you stop annoying me. Don't people ever complain about that kind of service? Pardon me, sir. There's been a mix-up on the line. Do we go on like this or do we have a date tonight? Another trick like that and I call the manager. Goodness. Hotel Eden. Hotel Eden. One minute please. Operator. Yes I will. Hotel Eden. Hotel Eden. Hotel Eden. Hello. Operator. Hotel Eden. If the resistance has crumbled how about a date tonight? No. Say, I bet you a buck we have a date tonight. Bet. I'll give you 100-1. Why should I take advantage? It's even money. Everything's okay upstairs. How is it here? Everything here is just ducky. Let's get out of here. - Don't forget that dollar. Operator. I'd be afraid to take chances with all them women the way you do. Johnny, you don't know it but girls all around this town .. Break up their phones just so I'll come and put things together. [ Telephone ] Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello? [ Telephone ] Hello. Hello. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, operator. Operator, my phone keeps ringing and no-one answers. Yes. Rhinelander 26483. You'll send someone right over? Thank you. [ Door knocks ] How's that for service? - Oh, it's you. I understand you got a ringing in your ears. Maybe it's the phone. No answer, huh? That's bad. I guess I had better go over your apparatus. Maybe you're not hooked up right? I'll say you are in trouble. You ought to have more company. The service. Would you like a longer cord? Did you bring one? I brought everything I thought fits your case. Then tie yourself to the chandelier. I'm going to eat my dinner. - Go ahead, duchess. I'm afraid my body will be in your way. It will be just like eating in a morgue. That's funny. I didn't see that table there. Gee, I am sorry. Unless you like hash. Now, Duchess. Don't take it like that. It's not like you had consomm? or fish. Tell you what. I'll buy you the best dinner in town. You're the lowest, most contemptible .. - Don't thank me. Get your hat. I want to slap your face. - Come, come. You're not going out bare-headed? - I don't go out at all. Alright. I'll get your hat for you. - No you won't. I can get it. The stubbornest dame I ever met. - You're the stupidest jackass. Fine. That means you're falling for me. Swell. Step on it because I'm starving. Alright, fresh guy. I'll let you buy me dinner. Since you deliberately spoiled mine. But once dinner is over we're strangers are far as I'm concerned. Try and keep that big mouth of yours full of consomm? and not conversation. Next time I ask for a date don't make so much trouble. Make you trouble? That is, if I ever ask you again. You're not conceited, are you. You don't expect to crack the marriage license column the first thing, do you? I didn't expect you to take me out at all. No? Then you must have been pleasantly surprised. What's the matter, duchess? I got something on my mind. So have I. I wish you knew. - I do know. That is the trouble with you. What is the problem, duchess? I got to get up early to start looking for Want-Ads. What? I am open for a new job. What's the matter with the hotel? - I quit. I get it. Some guy is bothering you. - Why do you say that? Because I know guys. And you are worth bothering. That isn't it at all. I've got in a little jam. Hey. What's this leading to, a touch? That's the dirtiest crack you've made so far. Worse than your earlier ones. I need my head examined going out with you. Take me out of here. Hold everything, duchess. I am sorry. Let me go home. Look. I got an idea. How'd you like a job at the phone company? Any company you're connected with is quarantine to me. No kidding. I think I can get you a swell job. Why, the president and I .. When my nose itches, he sneezes for me. I tell you what I'll do. I'll see my old pal Flood tomorrow and you'll be on the payroll by noon. No kidding. Now please go home, Terry. I mean it. Why? Because you have an idea and I'm against it. What is wrong with a good idea? - You can't come in. I've got to go in. My tools are in there. I'll hand them out to you. - And I got to put your phone together. Well. Look at the mess you made. It's alright. I'll help you clean it up. You go and fix that phone. Is it connected? Uhuh. I think we should make a test. You have a home, haven't you? Or do they lock up the asylum at midnight? You know, you look tired. Why not go to bed? I'll be in bed two minutes after that door is locked between us. Yeah. But you might forget to pull up the covers. I'd better stay and tuck you in. I don't think so. What's the matter? Are you afraid of your natural impulses? You're not one of my natural impulses. Prove it. Listen, nitwit. You don't think you'd go with that job you were talking about? Wrong number, baby. Come on. Let's be friends. Give me a kiss, will you. Then I will fade unless you change your mind. That 'fade' thing is the happiest thought you've had tonight. And we waste time fighting. You had better go now. Either you have got high-tension resistance or I am .. Slipping. Bye, duchess. See you in the morning. Say, I forgot. I win that bet. You owe me a buck. Never mind. Put it in a dime savings bank. Start an account for young Terry to go to Harvard later on. It won't be long now. Nitey nitey. Hiya, slaves. Hi, Terry. Hello Terry. Hello Terry. Hey, Terry. Not again? I've got it this time. This will save the subscribers thousands of dollars a year. Here is the idea. A guy holds a party. Someone gets full of sentimental gin and remembers a girl in Omaha. He sneaks the phone and calls her up. The host finds a long distance call on his bill. He don't know which guest did it. And he has to pay. This invention puts a stop to all that. And this one won't go wrong. Why don't you call it 'Marie'? - Huh? Nothing. I'm going in to see Flood. - Let me show you how it works. Now. Dial long distance. [ Bell ringing ] Is that a sensation or is it? That will stop most people from doing long distance calls. Don't breathe a word about it, Terry. That's great. I bet the girl can hear that in Omaha. Now, hang up the receiver and the bell stops ringing. Fine. It stops ringing, huh? When? That's funny. What in hell is going on in here? Shut that thing off. That's great, Happy. I don't blame you for keeping it a secret. I won't breathe a word to anybody. That's fine. Good morning, Joe. Got a minute? Come here. Well, Joe. How's the old health, kid? Now listen, Terry. I don't lend anybody any money. - No no. But. I was going to ask you a favor. Ah, so that's it. Yeah. A friend of mine. She's a girl. She needs a job. We worked on a hotel switchboard and thought maybe .. Maybe you could get her on here. You're sure she's competent? - You bet she is. I knew you'd fix it. Well. Maybe I can find a place for her. That's swell, Joe. Let me see. If I use a little pull. I can probably get her the right spot. Something easy. That's great. I knew you'd figure it out. Yeah. I could. If I wanted to. - Thanks. But I wouldn't give a friend of yours the right time. What? Anybody you know should be picked up as a suspicious character. Lay off, Joe. You aren't talking about a tramp. Competent, huh? I'll tell you the job I had in mind for her. Some place in a nut factory. Any dame who falls for you ain't competent. She's an imbecile. One more crack and I bust you wide open. If there were a million jobs .. This dame would still be leading the breadline. Alright. Forget it. Forget it. It serves me right for asking a slug like you for a favor. Hey. Terry. Has this .. Dame of yours .. got a friend? Ah, nuts. The answer is no? I'm sorry, duchess. A tough break. The president is in Washington and they just hired a flock of new girls. He said if something comes up he'll let me know. Did he send me his love? That's that. You don't know any other presidents, do you? How about calling up Sam Erskine long distance? Hold that thought. Hold that thought. I got a guy. I got a guy. What a dope I am. Wait a minute. I'll think of his name. Schuyler. Schuyler. That's the guy. A big investment man. Do anything for me. From now on you got a new business address. Hit it, Johnny. Since I am greatly indebted to Mr Riley. We may be able to find a place for you. You say you've been working on a switchboard? Yes, sir. Report to Mr West. - Thank you. Office. Just a minute. Schuyler and Company. Yes. I'll connect you. Schuyler and Company. Hiya, duchess. Hello Terry. Mentioning your name was like having a letter from congress. You must know where the bodies are buried. Sure. I'm working right now. Look. It isn't the 4th July but we're celebrating tonight. Alright? That's swell. See you later, kid. I knew if you kept juggling them powder puffs around long enough. One would smack you on the skull and fracture it. If I know all the signs, you are hooked. Yeah? You'd be a better man if you'd let one of them heat you up. You're so cold you spit ice cubes. Why not get a dame and bring her along tonight? Not me. I'm a man's man. You? Come on. Let's get out of here. Duchess, you're sure easy on the eyes. No wonder I'm so daffy about you. Are you Terry Riley? - Yeah. What about it? There's a gentleman at the door looking for you. For me? Are you sure? Alright. Tell him I'll be right there. Stay where you are, honey. It may be the mayor or somebody for me. More likely a policeman. Cross your fingers. Hello Loretta. Marie, darling. How are you? - Fine, thanks. Meet the boyfriend of the night, Mr Garrison. Call him 'Turk'. - I'm pleased to meet you. Hello. Sit down, Loretta. Thanks. Tell me, Marie. How do you like your new job? It makes my head swim. Nobody speaks of less than $50,000 in that office. How about lunch tomorrow at one? We'll go to a show or something. You get Saturday afternoons off? Usually yes. But I can't meet you tomorrow at one. Mr Schuyler expects some bonds. I must wait until he goes. Someone must be there when they deliver a fortune. I'll call you later. It must be a busy place where you work. - Yeah. How about some drinks? - Okay. Our transmitter has busted again. Hello, handsome. Where you been? I thought fortune tellers knew everything. Un-glue yourself, will you. Why didn't you come out and see me? You son of a person, you. What's the idea of bringing this tomato? You told me to dig up a dame. This is what I dug up. You go right back and plant her again. What's the matter with her? You told me to get hot, didn't you? Let us three old pals go out some place. You are cockeyed. So am I. Come on. Let's go home and I'll give you a reading. Alright. Wait five minutes and then start. Got it? Walk once around the hall and then come in. Got it? - I got it. Hello Marie. - I wasn't expecting you. Loretta said you worked here. I dropped in to say hello. Alright. Hello. - Don't be like that. Here's something on that debt I owe you. - Don't be silly. Go on. Take it. It's just an instalment. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Mr Weston. Let's get going. Schuyler and Company? Let me talk to Mr Schuyler please. Mr Schuyler is busy right now. Will you call later? Thank you. Listen, Marie. Don't be silly about it. You've got me all wrong. Has Mr Weston gone? Yes, sir. He left a moment ago. Oh. Schuyler and Company. No, sir. You have the wrong number. Schuyler and Company. No. The is Empire 64282. Alright. Sorry. Mr Weston please. - Mr Weston just left for the weekend. Left? Funny. I was to meet him here. - I am sorry. Schuyler and Company. What number are you calling? No, sir. You have the wrong number. I'll wait a while. He may come back. - Alright. Schuyler and Company. No. This is Empire 64282. Alright. Schuyler and Company. Make it snappy. I'm going to the ballgame. Okay. Schuyler and Company. No. This is Empire 64282. Van Nuys Investment Company. I have a package for Mr Schuyler. Mr Schuyler is waiting for you. Go right in. Schuyler and Company. You have the wrong number. Mr Schuyler? You are from Van Nuys, huh? - Yes, sir. Sing right there please. Thank you. Goodbye. Schuyler and Company. I told you before you had the wrong number. So long. - So long. Schuyler and Company. No. This is Empire 64692. Schuyler and Company. You have got the wrong number. Schuyler and Company. Wrong number. Schuyler and Company. Ask the operator to dial your number. I see Mr Weston forgot our appointment. I'll see him Monday. Your name? - Never mind. I'll be back. - Alright. Schuyler and Company. The wrong number! As you're busy, I'll drop in again. - Don't hurry. Schuyler and Company. No! Going up? Going up? Please ask the operator to dial your number. Schuyler and Company. Just a minute please. Mr Harvey Dewell calling you, Mr Schuyler. I don't want to speak to anyone. Call the Van Nuys Trust and find out what's delayed that messenger. Tell them I am waiting. Taxi. The Eden Hotel. Quick. Say, Riley. There's an SOS call for you upstairs in the GM's office. You take it, Johnny. Get some more laughs. No kidding. They phoned all over for you. Finally recognising my ability. Thanks. Hello, Mr Schuyler. How do you do. You sent for me? - Yes. Do you know a girl by the name of Marie Lawson? Sure. Of course I do. Did you recommend her to Mr Schuyler? Yes. I gave her a note to him. What of it? These two gentlemen are from the detective bureau. Now, they say this Marie Lawson is one of a gang .. That robbed Mr Schuyler of $90,000 in negotiable bonds. A couple of hours ago. - That's a lot of tripe. How did you meet her? - How do you meet any girl? Where? - The Eden Hotel. She's just pulled a job. - A job? When she meets you she quits the hotel. Sure. She quit. - You had the confidence of Mr Schuyler. Her mob figured that would be valuable. - What are you driving at? They had you plant her in Mr Schuyler's office. The rest was easy. It's alphabet crackers to me. I know nothing about a mob. I doubt she does either. - Where is she? I don't know. Did you send a package today to Mr Schuyler's office? With this card? I don't know anything about it. I don't believe Riley had any actual knowledge of the crime or the plot. He's been with us for five years now. And his record is clean. I'll go further. I'll stake my job on him. I've known him for years. Nobody can make me believe he'd try to pull anything that's not on the level. Thanks, Joe. - He's no crook. He's just a plain sap. I don't really want accuse Riley of complicity. But I did hope he may be able to give us some information about this girl. As he's the only one who knows anything about her. And you don't know where she is? I haven't got any idea. He never did have one. Alright. If we want you we'll send for you later. Is that all, Mr Madison? That's all now, Terry. But from the standpoint of the company .. I wish you would cooperate with the police in trying to find this girl. Yes, sir. Come on. You've said all you know. Welch. Tail him. That's one way to find this girl. Okay. We'll get her. That's one system that never misses. I hope you are right. You sure found yourself a gal. Yeah. You find a prize dame. Out of a million skirts you've got to pick an itchy-fingered molly. I told you that any dame that fell for you would be a suspicious character. And he wanted me to give her a job up here. It's a good thing I didn't. She'd probably have walked away with all the dynamos. Keep it up. Keep it up, but I still say she wasn't in on it. Listen to him. The dame pockets ninety grand. And scrams. And he's still a character reference for her. What do you expect, her forwarding address? I told him something would happen sooner or later. I knew it. Bonnie says I'm awful psychic. Hello? I haven't been able to get Miss Lawson on her phone. Know where I can reach her? I do not. She hasn't been in since yesterday. And the cops have been here prowling around and making a lot of trouble. You'd better find that floozy. Or this company won't have any more use for you than a snake has for brassieres. Let's ask Bonnie. There is a gal you can depend on. Boy, is she psychic. Don't worry. I'll find her. Why don't you run down and psyche around with Bonnie for a little while? Yeah. 'Bonnie says I'm so psychic'. The nitwit. Come on, Loretta. Squeeze hard. Try and think. Where can she be hiding? I don't know. She came in here looking for Nicky. Did she find him? - No. He checked out that morning. - Seen him since? Who is Nicky? He used to live in the hotel. He used to buy us presents. He seemed stuck on Marie the way he hung around. Yeah? If I find him he'll find his right eye hanging on my watch fob. What's this about? Every time I turn I find a cop in my hair. It's alright, Loretta. Just keep wandering around in a daze and nobody will bother you. Come on, Terry. Sit in. The deuces are wild this time. He's wild all the time. Mr laughing jackass. Leave me alone. I'm trying to think. Any time you want to find a dame .. All you have to do is go where you'd go if you were a girl. And she will be there. I got it all figured out. Sure. Poker. I'll stay. I'll stay. [ Telephone ] Hello. This is Marie. Where are you? I have to see you. You'll see me so fast it makes your teeth ache. Now, tell me where you are. I'm at the Alexander Hotel. Room 405. Alright. Stay right there. Don't move an eyelash. Sure I'll come alone. Was it Marie? - Wait until I crash in on her. Maybe I'd better go with you. - You're out of this. I'll go alone. That dame is going to get him in a jam. Maybe I shouldn't have advised him. Taxi. Alexander Hotel. Go ahead. Let's go. [ Door knocks ] Terry? - Yes. It's me. Terry. I should take a punch at you. - Please listen. You pull a fast one. I'm a sucker. - You don't understand. Every editor and dick in town knows what happened. Please let me explain. You can explain anything. - Will you listen or not? I'll listen. This will be great. Too bad the DA can't hear it. Look, Terry. I had nothing to do with taking those bonds. When the messenger boy came I was busy so I sent him in to Schuyler. What about Schuyler? He saw Nicky in the office. I knew they'd check on me and find out I knew him. If they found that out they wouldn't believe that wasn't in with them. Sounds daffy to me. - Me too. That's why I must find Nicky or nobody will believe me. I still think it's a lot of hoolah. Believe me, Terry. Please. You must. Nice work, Riley. You ought to have a badge. Come on, sister. Let's meet the DA. You double-crossed me. - I had nothing to do with it. Come on. You can write it all to him in a letter. Where's your hat and coat? What do you want? - Information. Why can't I go in there? Because nobody wants you in there. I want to see the district attorney. I'm sorry, Mr Kirkland. He's busy at the moment. It's about the Marie Lawson case. I've been retained on her behalf. Oh. Just a moment. I am a friend of Miss Lawson's. Did she hire you? I'd rather not discuss it. Let's go. Longacre 4419. That's Kirkland, the mystery man. I still don't get it. Well, let's see. Who'd be apt to send a lawyer to Marie? I don't know. Maybe the Bar Association. There are only two kinds of people who would be interested in Marie. Those who want her to talk and those who want her to be quiet. That spells Nicky. Listen, stupid. I got a hunch this Kirkland is Nicky's mouthpiece. Let's ask him where Nicky is. When he returns he must report to Nicky. We're going to tap his wire. They won't let you get away with that. - They'll know nothing about it. I still think we ought to ask Kirkland. - You big ducky. Come on. Here we are. We'll get canned for this if Flood finds out. Be quiet. Don't worry. I will. Here, Rip Van Winkle. Take a smell of this. I was listening. I just thought I'd fool them. Pretending to be asleep. I've called everybody in the book but no Nicky. Your hunches are just like Happy's. They look okay. Only they don't work. They got to work or we're sunk. - Yeah? One hour more and I'm going to eat. You're not eating. You're .. - Somebody's calling. A man? - Yeah. Listen. I did as you asked. The girl is a little harder to handle than I expected. And that DA is no soft touch. The girl didn't tumble I sent you? Yeah. That's him. Hang on to this and I'll trace the call. He called in. If he hangs up before you get it, it's too bad. Hang on. What about springing her? I'll arrange bail tomorrow and see the girl again. If she's reasonable we can fix the whole thing up. Though they have a good case. Right. Now listen. Get this. Don't let anybody know you are working for me. Get it? Alright. You lay low until you hear from me again. I'll phone you tomorrow. Did you get it? - Yeah. Longacre 2319. Now that's settled I can eat. - No you can't. Your job's just begun. I'm starving. Check the line to see if he lives there. It's our only chance. What will you do? - See if I can find that guy. Don't take your ear off that line. Get me? Okay. Hello. It's Terry Riley. Give me the address on Longacre 2319. Yeah. 129 Pine Street? Thanks. Will you stop worrying? Take it easy, will you. But if this girl talks we're in a tough spot. Stop worrying. I tell you Kirkland is going to take care of everything. Stick 'em up. Inside. Who's the stranger? Marie's boyfriend. He must have been taking detective lessons by mail. What will we do with him? Give him another lesson in keeping his nose out of things. How did you learn about this joint? Come on. Open that yapper when I talk to you. Maybe I can make him talk. Wait a minute. Somebody may be tailing this guy. Stick him in there, will you. Take a look outside. One peep out of you and I come back and measure you for the undertaker. You won't have any use for this. You take care of that. Come on. Pack your stuff and let's go. Sherlock Holmes, huh? What will we do with him? Leave him here? No. He likes our company so we'll take him with us. Do you know your future address? The bureau of missing persons. What do you guys plan to do with me? You will find out soon enough. Now wait a minute. Give me a break. I'm licked and I know it and I can't get any help. Brother, you are going to need help. If I had an even chance I'd do alright with you guys. I wish my gang was here. I'd have you all in the can. Sure. A lot of brave mugs. Four to one and practising on me like a punching bag. One more yap out of you and so help me you get the heat. Joe. They got Terry. Who has Terry and what did they want with him? The mob. The guys what stole the bonds. If you ever had a mind I swear you've lost it. We traced them through a phone call. Terry went to nail them. I stayed by the phone. They got Terry. They're slugging him around. They're going to beat it and take Terry too. Now slow down. Take it easy. Talk sense. The gorillas that framed Marie have got Terry. Where? 129 Pine Street. Downtown. - Come on, boys. The car is ready. Bring that sucker along. Come on, sweetheart. Your folks won't know you when they see you again. Come on, Johnny. Step on it. He's going fast enough. It won't go any faster. Get going. Why don't you invent something Happy, to make these things go faster. He is going fast enough. Come on you. Come on. Get him in the car. Come on, boys. Hey. Come on. What are you hitting me for? - I can't see without my glasses. How does it feel to be Mrs Riley? - Swell, Mr Riley. So peaceful and quiet. Isn't it great to be alone? [ Telephone ] Hello. No. There is nothing wrong with the phone. No. [ Telephone ] Hello? No. The phone is alright. It's swell. Yeah. [ Telephone ] [ Door knocks ] What is this, the Grand Central Station or something? Alright, boys. It looks like this will take all night. Alright, boys. Get busy now. Joe, old pal. Do me a favor, will you? Get these mugs out of here. Hurry up, men. We can't be here all night. ..f-s..
