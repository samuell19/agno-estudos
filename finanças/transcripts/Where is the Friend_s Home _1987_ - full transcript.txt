Institute for the intellectual development of children and... adolescents. Dedicated to Sohrab Sepehri. Where is my friend's house? What's happening? What's all this mess? What happened? Hadn't you promised me you'd be quiet? I can't even be away for five minutes. Everybody, stand up. Come on. Who has told you to sit down? Sit down. As soon as I am late some day, the class is a mess. You show me you don't know how to behave yourselves. You can't be trusted. Let me see your homework I told you that, if I am going to be late, it's because something happened to me. And it seems like I'm talking to the walls. Quiet! Sir, Al? Hemmat? is not here. Be quiet! And do not speak if not asked! What's this, Nematzadeh? How many times did I tell you to write your homework in a book? How many times, Nematzadeh? How many times must I repeat it to you? How many times did I tell you, Nematzadeh? I see your fingers very well but I want you to say it once again. - Three times. - Louder. Three times! Three times and you are still doing it. Well, now I am going to tear this to show you a lesson. Look up, Nematzadeh. Nematzadeh, I told you to look. Nematzadeh. Nematzadeh! How many times did I tell you to write in a book? How many times? Answer! Come on! How many times did I tell you? How many times? Three times. Three times, and after all that you still don't do it. Why didn't you do it? - Can I come in, sir? - What time is this to arrive? I came a long way. From Poshteh. You came from Poshteh today? - Yes, sir. - Go, sit down. Everyone who comes from Poshteh, you have to consider that you must... Shut it and sit down. You must not forget to leave 10 minutes earlier and sleep half an hour earlier, so you get enough sleep. So that you don't arrive late. Do you understand? - Did you understand? - Yes, sir. So, Nematzadeh, you admit that I told you three times and even so you have not listened to me. Are you listening to me? Answer. Why? Tell me. Come on, look up! Why Nematzadeh? It's because I was at my cousin's house and I forgot my book there. Sir. What? Yesterday I was at my cousin's house and I left my book there, sir. - Sir, I have his book - You have his book? - Yes. - Did you lie to me? - He is my cousin. - He is your cousin? - You are his cousin? - Yes sir. - And he was with you yesterday? - Yes sir. Ok, let's see. I told you many times. When you come home from school, first, do your homework then put your books in the backpack, and after you can do whatever you feel like. You can play or go visit someone. Quiet! Or if you go anywhere you do not take your books. This way you won't forget them somewhere, like Nematzadeh did. And remember, if I tell you to write in a book, it's because it shows discipline. - Why have you gone under there? - My back hurts, sir. - What? - My back hurts, sir. Well, it won't heal by going under the desk. There are very important reasons for writing in a book. First, it will make you have discipline. And secondly, we can compare today's work with the work of last month. This is Ahmadpoor's homework. This is today's work. Can you see it? This is his work. And this, this is last month's. Do you understand now why I insist that you have a book for your homework? - You too, Nematzadeh? - Yes sir. So this is the last time. Next time, you will have to be expelled from the school. Yes, sir. Did you hurt yourself? Don't cry, don't cry, baby. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Cover him well. - Right now, right now. Ahmad, bring me some diapers. Hurry up. Ahmad, these are wet. Hang them there, in the room. Quick. Do you hear me? Hurry up! - Ahmad, come, let's go play. - I have to do homework. - Do it later. - Ahmad. Where are you, Ahmad? I'm coming. The baby is freezing. Take the bottle and bring it up grandmother gives you some boiling water to prepare the bottle for the baby. - Where the bottle? - Beside the vase. - I want boiling water. - Inside the house. - Hello. - Hi. - Are you coming to play? - I have to do my homework. - You don't? - I only have three lines left. I wrote this, this and this and I only have three lines left. I have to do it all. Why did you go up wearing shoes? Don't you see how I take them off? You have to take your shoes off before going up. Add two sugar cubes, but hurry up. I am going to do my homework. Ahmad, can't you hear the child? Go give him the bottle. Rock him a little. Mother, I took by accident Mohammad Reza's book and I have to go return it to him. - How are you? - A little better. - Take care. - Mother... - Mother... Mother... - What is it? I took by accident the book with the homework... of Mohammad Reza. What? I didn't realise I took Mohammad Reza's homework book. Do your homework and then go to play. I don't want to go play. I want to return his book. First do your homework and then you can go play. Do you see how I am taking my shoes off before going up? - Where are you going? - To play. He has to do his homework in his book. Ok, but be good, ok? He has to do his homework in his book. Al? has already done his homework. He returned from school. He has done his homework and now he goes to play. And all you do is make trouble. And you never want to do your homework. I wasn't talking about him, I was talking about Mohammad Reza. I am sure he already did his homework. All the children did it except you. Go, Al?. - Finish your homework. - It's his book. Mother, I took his book and I have to return it. Otherwise he will be punished. Do your homework. Go rock the baby. Al?, I told you not to waste time. Go. And you, do your homework! But I don't want to go play I have to... So do your homework. I took his book home with me and I have to ret... - Come on, do your homework! - Return it. Did you hear me? Go, get me the bucket with the laundry. Mother, look at this. This is what I was telling you. The two are identical, but this is his and this is mine. - Can't you see? - Yes I do. So? - I have to give him his. - So, give it him tomorrow. But tomorrow the teacher will expel him from class. This is why I have to return it now, before... If he gets expelled, I am sure he deserves it. - But I took it by accident... - And you didn't realise? No, because the two are identical. Doesn't matter you'll return it tomorrow. No, mom, I have to return it today. - And where does he live? - In Poshteh. So far? In Poshteh? You cannot go there! But many children come every day to school from there. Don't lie to me. It's absolutely impossible. I swear. If you don't believe me go ask. Don't swear, and do your homework. This is what you have to do. Let me go return it! I have already told you, you must do your homework. Also, you have to go buy bread. But I have to take it to him otherwise he will be punished. Do your homework and be quiet! - Mom, please let me go! - Obey! - The teacher will be... - I told you you must do your homework! Don't move from there and do the work. Otherwise I will smack you so hard...! - Did you hear me? Did you hear me? - Yes. Come on, get up and go get bread. When your father will come, he will know what to do with you. Is that our Ahmad? What is he going to do in Poshteh? - Hi. - Hello. - Do you know where Nematzadeh lives? - No, I don't know. - He is my classmate. - No, I don't know. - Is this Poshteh here? - Poshteh is behind that house. Boy, can you throw me that up here? Come on boy, it's not going to get here. Madame, he doesn't have enough strength. Better you give it to me and I will pass it on. Boy, give it to me from this side, come on. - Where? - Here. Give it to me and I will pass it on. That's it, go on the step. Good, boy! Well done. - Do you know where Mohammad Reza lives? - Thank you son. You're welcome. Please, would you know where Nematzadeh lives? I don't know. Did they tell you where he lives more or less? - In Poshteh. - But, in which district? Poshteh. Here we have the district of Mazevar, the district of Khanevar, the district of Assemar, the district of Khanevar, Mazevar... They didn't tell you where it is? In Poshteh. Everything here is called Poshteh But which district, son? - Hey, Morteza. Do you live here? - Yes. Do you know where is the house of Nematzadeh? I think that it's down there. You don't know? It's because I have his book and I have to give it back. What can I do? I know where his cousin lives. - Hemat?? - Yes. Let's go, take me there. We'll go return it and we'll come back. I have to carry the milk. Ok, at least tell me how to get there. His house is in Khanevar, in the steep street. There is a staircase in front which ends in a blue door. And there is a bridge near the house. - What's the name of the district? - Khanevar. Morteza, bring the milk. Sir, how do you get to Khanevar? Through there. Where is the Nematzadeh's home? I don't know. Do you know Hemmat?? Keep going straight. It's that path there to Khanevar. Are you there, Nematzadeh? Mohammad Reza! Nematzadeh, are you there? Are you there, Nematzadeh? I brought your book Mohammad Reza. Mohammad Reza! Mohammad Reza! Please answer! Where are you? I brought your book. Nematzadeh! Reza... Nematzadeh, I brought your book. Hey, whose are these trousers? - What? What? - Those trousers. I don't know whose trousers are those. I am talking about the trousers that are hanging. What do you want me to say? I don't know, son. They belong to Nematzadeh. And I have to return his book. No one is home. It's shut. I don't know anything, boy. I don't know anything. - Hello. - Hi. Whose are those brown trousers that are hanging there? I don't know. No one is home. On that street there... I don't know those people. I don't know anything. What about those trousers hanging back there? I don't know. I don't know. - Those brown trousers. - I told you, I don't know. - I'm sick, go away. - Let me show them to you. Can't you see that I cannot move? At least come so that I can show it to you. I can't go. I am sick. Very sick. - Come on, please, come. - I can't go, son. - I am sick. I can't. - Come on, be kind. Come, come. Look, look. Come. I can't, I am sick. - My son, I can barely move. - It's near. Just there. - Is Mohammad Reza there? - Who is he? - Nematzadeh. - No. - This is not his home? - No, he doesn't live here. - But those trousers are his. - No, these are my grandson's. - Is this Khanevar? - Yes, it's Khanevar. And he came yesterday evening to ask my husband to help him find a job. - What is his profession? - Waiter. He was working three years but then his boss sold the shop and told him that he had to go away. But since he is my husband's cousin he told him that he had to help him. He barely has money to eat. They have three children... - Who are you looking for, kid? - Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh. He's not here. They told me he lives around here where the blue door is. - This is Hemmat?'s home. - Wonderful. I would like to see him. - He went to Koker. - He left? Yes. - Who are you looking for? - Hemmat?. - But, which Hemmat?? - Al? Hemmat?. He's gone. He left 5 minutes ago. He went to Koker. I just came from Koker. Well, then you'd have seen him. He went with his father to Koker. Al? Hemmat?! Al? Hemmat?! Al? Hemmat?! Ahmad! Where are you going? Come here, kid! - Hello. - Where have you been? To buy bread. I asked you a question and I expect you to answer. Where have you been? What did you go to Poshteh for? To return the book to Mohammad Reza. He is my classmate. - Did you give it to him? - No, I didn't see him. - Go get my cigarettes. - I have to go to the bakery. First, go get my cigarettes. But if I go there late they will have no more bread. I do not want to repeat it again. - Here, I have cigarettes. - No, I also have some. My point was not about the cigarettes. I want the kid to be educated for in his tomorrow to be a good man. When I was little my dad would give me... he'd give me a cent a week. And he would beat me every fortnight. And sometimes he would forget to give me the money on purpose, but he would never forget to give me the smack. So that he would make of me a strong man. And you saw how my grandson came here and I had to repeat my words to him three times. And he did not pay attention. And we want the kid to be educated properly, because if he is lazy he will not be useful in society. Let's suppose that he listened to you. Would you still hit him? Because that wouldn't be... Of course I'd hit him. I've told you already even if he forgot the allowance. What he would never forget... would be giving the eventual beating. Of that, you can be sure. This is what teaches discipline. In society the children must maintain the sense of discipline. They must obey their parents. They must respect all the traditions. Yes, but what if the child does nothing wrong? What would you do then? What? Find a good excuse to beat him every fortnight so that he won't forget. I used to work with an Iranian engineer. We'd build roads. After a while two foreign engineers arrived. They looked at the road and they said that it was 5 centimeters too low. The Iranian engineer said that the problem could be fixed with sand and gravel. And that this was the solution. He said we had to fix those 5 centimeters. He said that it would make it look good. Otherwise the measurements wouldn't be the ones in the contract. But when he was leaving I approached the engineer and asked: Tell me, why is my salary 6,000 tomans. and they receive 12,000? He answered: if I told them once and they did it, but he ordered me to do it twice. And that is why I receive 6,000 tomans. That is the reason. Yes, that's the reason why they gave me the order two times. And consequently I received 6,000 tomans and they receive 12,000. Do you understand? For such things, my friend, we must be educated in a way so that they can tell us something only once. In the good old days, when our parents would educate us, they expected total obedience. That is for sure. - Go, look for the doors. - Are these yours? These? Leave it, I'll go. - Here's your tea. - Very good. The doors were here this morning. We fixed the contract for 3,000 tomans. And I have to get 500 from the engineer. But it did not come out well, so... I didn't cancel it. I kept it. But I have to pay the blacksmith, the carpenter the bricklayer, the workers... Then, I have to pay Mr. Jamali, and then I would not have nothing left. In that case, I myself will take care of Mr. Jamali. What can we do? I don't know, I only asked Mr. Agha Khan... that it makes the quality of doors that the children won't ever get cold. Certainly, you have nothing to worry about. I will do them right now. Do you also need any doors? - No, thanks. - Why not? - I have some already. - Your doors are falling apart. - But I am happy with them. - You need new doors. - No, I am happy. - But you'll be very cold. - I don't mind. I like being cold. - I would make you iron doors. I have doors. The ones I'll make you, they'll last your whole life. I won't live much longer. Come on, grandfather! You still have many years to live. Stop lecturing! I don't need them! Listen to me! I am known in the entire region as a good and meticulous worker since many years. And those who I made are the ones lasting. - I don't doubt it. But I don't need them. - How long have you had yours? Probably less... I told you, no! I guarantee it! Listen to me! And when you'll see my work, you won't regret it. Go, take care of your business. The ones I have are good enough I told you already. Those old doors they will be a memory for you. - Stop with the memories! - They will display them in a museum. What good are they for a museum? In Tehran. Because your name will be remembered forever. Everyone will say: those doors belonged to a great man. You must think about that. After I die, what do I need them for? - Do you only think about death? - With my age... - How stubburn! - So, what do we do? Nothing, if he pays more I will bring the doors. - The engineer won't pay. - That's not my problem. Whether he pays or not, this is the price. - He won't pay! - You made the terms of contract! I didn't find the cigarettes. - Did you look for them or did your mother? - My mother. Why didn't you look for them? I asked you! - You go look for them. - I have to go to the bakery. - Hey, give me a piece of paper. - It's not mine. It's Mohammad Reza's. Doesn't matter. I only need one leaf. But it's Mohammad Reza's. And I have to return it. - Come on, boy. Give me a leaf. - But it's not mine. - I only need one. - The teacher will get mad at him. - Come on! It's just one sheet. - He'll get mad. Come on, kid, give it to me. Don't be hard headed. Listen to the elder ones. Give me the book! He will be furious. He won't be. I will only take a leaf. The teacher nor will find out. Look. Do you see? I am only going to take one page. There. There you go. The teacher won't find out. Here, take your book. No, no, wait. I need it to hold the sheet while I write. It's not mine. What should I write, Mr. Gholami? - Write. - I am writing... - The sum of... - The sum of... - The sum of 4,000 tomans... - The sum of 4,000 tomans... - for... - for... - Two doors for Nader Gholami. - For Nader Gholami. - I hereby certify... - I hereby certify... - Agha Khan Nematzadeh. - I certify. Here you go. Mr Nematzadeh. Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? You've seen it. Nothing happened. Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? - That money does not mean anything. - Well, I'll give it to you. Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? What matters is that we came to an agreement. Here you go. Yes, what matters is the agreement. - Very good. - Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? - Thanks to Jamali. - Yes, certainly. If it weren't for Mr. Jamali... - Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? - I would have not accepted - Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? - Think about what we have... spoken about. Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? The doors are good and you will enjoy them. In two years, at these heights they will be as they are now. I only want to make you some good doors. This is what you have to understand. Here you go, boy... Are you Mr. Nematzadeh? Is Mohammad Reza your son? What can a little bit more money do? If I cant even feed this animal. Is Mohammad Reza your son? Come here. Don't move, beast! Let's go. Come on! Hurry up! Bring the other door! Bring it... When you finish the work, I'll go to Poorcom's house... to see if he has finished making the doors. - And you'll bring them together? - Very good. - What do you want? What do you want? - Is this the home of Nematzadeh? - Who are you looking for? - Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh. - I don't know him. - He is my classmate. I am Nematzadeh, but I don't know any Mohammad Reza. We have plenty of Nematzadehs here. What is it that you're after? - I want to return his book. - I don't know him. Do you know if the father owns a truck? - I don't know. - Does he have sheeps? I don'know. Maybe yes. Once I brought milk to the vice-manager. - Do you know the public baths? - No. - The blacksmith's house? - No, I am from Koker. Look for the blacksmith's factory. It's very close to here. Beneath his house there is a shed full of sheep. - Ask there. Bye! - Where is it? - There. - Near his home. Near his house there is a dry tree. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! - Hello. What is it, son? - Is this the home of Nematzadeh? - Where did they tell you it is? - Here. Near the tree. That tree. Here we have a lot of trees, boy. Near the dead tree. We also have plenty of dead trees. You see, Nematzadeh doesn't live here. But I know him, yes. I remember him very well. - So you know him? - Of course I know him. His son was here but he went home. Are you his son's classmate? - Yes. He was here? - Yes. - Tell me where he lives! - Do you know where the public baths are? No. I am not from here. I am from Koker. - You are from Koker? - Yes. So, then wait, I will take you there. Buy some apples. I don't have teeth to eat apples. - Then buy them for your son. - He is not my son. Alright, for your grandson. I don't have children, and therefore no grandchildren. They are really good apples. Buy some. I am sure they are, but I have no teeth. Why do you want to see him? You'll see him tomorrow at school. I have to return his book to him today. But he is not here anymore. If you came 5 minutes earlier. I have been looking for him everywhere. But no one knows him. You should have come to me straight away. I know everyone. Whose son are you? - Abdu'llah's. - Which one of them? - Abdu'llah Ahmadpoor. - Abdu'llah Ahmadpoor from Koker? Yes. I know him too. I have done his doors. I also made the cradle of your father. I have done the door of your friend's house. And I also have done his windows. 40 years ago. And they didn't change one bit. But now they are changing them all, one by one for iron doors. But nobody asks what's wrong with those doors. And if that would be the case, I assure, if they had been bad nobody would have bought them. - How are you, Mashdi? - Well, thanks. I am very happy. He is also changing his to an iron door. He's heard that iron doors last a lifetime. But I don't know how long is a life. How old are you? - Eight. - Eight years old. My nephew also was exactly eight years. When his father took him to the city. Yes, sir. Do you see those doors and windows? My brother and I made them. When my brother was still here. Do you see how nice they are? That was a long time ago. 45 years ago. But later he had a wife and children. And he left to the city. I don't know what's in the city. I assure you I don't. But everyone is going there. Have you ever been to the city? - Twice. - I don't like the city at all. I assure you. Nothing at all. One's own place is another thing. - What did you say your name was? - Ahmad. You see, young Ahmad, it saddens me so much... when I see them leaving these windows and these doors which I built with so much effort to go to the city. I am talking about these windows. And I'd really like to know where they take them. The last few times I was in the city. I really wanted to find out what they have there. But sadly I did not manage to find out. And I've been doing it much less now. It's like I've lost my nephews. On the other hand, I am not interested in doing any more, because I don't have the sight or the strengh that I used to. My son, it's terrible to be old. Ahmad, please, wait a second. I want to wash my face and after we'll continure. - Come wash your face. - I am in a hurry. We've almost arrived. Your friend's home is right here. What good water! Spring water! Here, take this flower and put it in the book. Don't lose it. You must watch over it. Put it in the book. Sir, can you hurry up a little bit please? It's getting really late. Alright! Right now. I'm here. Let's go. Come on, let's go. That's your friend's home. Slowly! Take care. You can go through there. It's the first door to the left. - Do you want to give him the book? - Yes. Then I will sit here to rest a little bit. You go give him the book. Come, hurry. Look, there it is. I'll be here. Return quickly so we can leave together. Did you give him the book? You didn't even knock at the door! Let's go through here, so I can show you the doors and the windows that... I made. - No, it's already so late. - Come, it's on our way. - No, I'll be late. - It's alright. Let's go through here. I want to show you the doors and windows that I made. But it's very late. I have to go to the bakery. It's not the hour to buy bread. - So you come from Koker... - Yes. Do you have an older brother? Why is he not in charge of getting the bread? They've called him out. And now, it's better if I go quickly otherwise my father will scold me. I don't want him to get angry with me. What if I am faster and I take you home? - I'd like it, but I can't. - Why not? - You want to do it? - Sure. So let's go. - What are you doing standing there? - You are very slow. When I was your age I used to jump around from place to place. Is this better? Are you alright with this? - A little faster. - Faster? - Yes. - I'll try. - Better? - Yes. Let's go. Through here. - Do you have a cold? - No. - Are you cold? - No. - Would you like to put on my cover? - No, my mom will scold me. - You can return it to me tomorrow. - Go a little slower. I am out of breath. If I don't talk, I can go faster! - Alright. Then don't speak. - Alright. I won't speak anymore. Sir, you are tired and I am going to return late. You go ahead. I can't keep up. Yes. - What's the matter, Ahmad? - The dog is barking. - Are you afraid? - It's going to bite me. This is why I am telling you we have to walk together. But you are very slow and I am in a hurry. Alright, alright, I know I am too old to keep up with your pace. - We've arrived. - Where are we? This is my house, and Koker is on the other side. You go ahead on your own, I'll watch you. Go on boy, I'll watch you. - Come, eat. - I don't want any. - Why not? You're not hungry? - No. What is it? You don't like what you get? I don't want it. Come, eat. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? - Come, son. - I don't want to. - Why not? - I don't want. - Then go to bed. - No, I need to do the homework. - What? - I have to do homework. It's late and you are tired. You really don't want to eat? Alright, if you are not hungry don't eat. If you want to do homework go to the other room. We want to sleep. Have your dinner, my son. And when you finish, turn the lights off and go to bed. - Stand up. - Sit down. - How are you? - Well, sir. - Can I come in, sir? - Yes. - Sir, Ahmadpoor is not here. - Ahmadpoor is not here? Sit down. Good. I told you yesterday that you must not speak unless you're asked. Is it clear? Did you understand? - Yes, sir. - Let's see the homework. Ghasem Hojat, let's see... Why did you write pedestrians with two S's? The word pedestrian is written only with one S. Is that clear? That's good. What's this, kid? Why is it so dirty? My hands were sweating, that's why I got it dirty. But you haven't filled all the page. I went to the farm and I saw they had cut off the water, so... - What did you have to do there? - Work. - With whom? - With my father. You see, children, your first obligation is education. First you must dedicate yourselves to your studies. And later you can help your father at the farm and your mother at home. As you can see, this pupil did not do his homework... because he had to work at the farm. And I am going to let it go because it's the first time. And I will also let the second one pass but the third time ... there will be no excuse that is acceptable. Next time, first do your homework. And after, help you father. Do you understand? Good. Parvaneh, And your homework? Why didn't you write anything? - I didn't do it. - What? - I didn't do it. - And why didn't you do it? - Answer. - My back hurts. - What? - My back... - Louder - My back hurts. Why does your back hurt? Are you better now? - Can I come in? - Why are you late? - You don't come from Poshteh. - Yes, sir. - Do you come from Poshteh? - No, sir. Take your seat. - Did he look at your homework? - No. I did it for you. - Sir... - Ahmadpoor. Ahmadpoor... What's going on? Be quiet! - Sir... - Ahmadpoor. - This is Nematzadeh's. - Sorry. Good. - Sir... - Nematzadeh. Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh. Very good. Well done, boy.
