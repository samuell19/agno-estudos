I have no idea why I write. THE WORLD AFTER US Because you need to, because it's your language. No. No, that's a fantasy. Actually, I think I'm tired. I always thought writing was an act of gratitude towards my parents, but it's not. Today, when I write, I do it for myself. This way, I live something else, I escape. I could write my life without getting bored. It's not some kind of catharsis. When I write, I talk to myself. I understand what I do wrong. Wrong? 6 MONTHS EARLIER Hi. - Who is it for? Tell me. - No, just sit down. - Bibi, you're here. - How are you? - There you go, honey. - Thank you. - I'm happy to see you. - Me too. All good? What are you writing these days? A novel. Can I know what it's about? It's complicated, you wouldn't like it. Then write something else. You should write the stories of Inspector Jack. That was great. That's for kids, it doesn't have any literary value. Fatma, I have to go. - Bye. - Have you met my son? - Philippe. Nice to meet you. - Labidi. He lives in Paris. - Welcome to Lyon. - Thank you. - For you. - No, I don't want it. - Take it! - Keep it. Mom! - Take what your mother gives you. - Yes. - Don't piss me off. Take it. - Yeah, OK. Hi. I'll have a coffee, please. Thank you. I stayed two weeks in Tokyo, because I wanted to see... Excuse me. I know it's lame to ask you this. You must hear it pretty often. Cool, thanks. - You were saying? - Yeah. The houses there are insane. But you were talking about the train, right? It's pretty pricey. Thanks. You forgot that. Yes, I know. I wanted to... give you my phone, it's classier than just my number. Do you want to get coffee? I'm already having coffee with a friend. Yeah, of course. It's OK. Maybe some other time, I don't know. Some day. At least now you have my number. It didn't go through. Do you want to try again? No, it won't work. I'll just pay for the soda. - She'll pay for her salad. - No worries. She saw I was getting uncomfortable, so she pretended it was normal to split the check. Like: "It's the 21st century and men don't have to pay anymore." What? It's weird, I thought actors only dated among themselves. I'm done, never again. Artists are self-centered. - Not all of them. I imagine that... - You're an actor? - No, not at all. - Otherwise, tell me. I'm not an artist. I mean, I do write a little. Maybe a novel someday, but I don't even think about it. I'm not an artist at all. Anyway, to sum up: you have to pay for your salad. Then we left and she took me back to her place. Are you asleep or just bored? I don't know what to say. It's beautiful. - Stop. - It is. It reminds me of when I met Sarah. Let me check if my dad's inside, but he's supposed to work tonight. - Don't go anywhere. - I won't. What? Then what? Did you spend the night with her? Was it beautiful? You're a pain, I'm going to bed. Labidi is in love. Labidi. In love. In love. Labidi. In love. Labidi. In love. In love. Labidi. Labidi. In love. Relax, it's going to be fine. We're here for very good reasons. - She's doing it for you. - No. Believe in yourself. Sorry, I was with a bad writer with a good book. - Vincent, how are you? - I'm great. - Ladibi. Labidi, Labidi. - Yes. It's pretty. - Is it Moroccan? - Tunisian. Follow me. Have you met Benjamin Merci? - Nice to meet you. - We'll be more comfortable upstairs. I read the first three chapters that Vincent sent me. They're promising. I also read your short story. But what you got here is on another scale. The short story is good, but the novel is sharper and in keeping with our editorial line. The way you manage, at your age, to immerse yourself in the context of the Algerian War with so much precision and meticulousness is a quality we're looking for. And given the subject, the novel should come out in September, so it can be part of the new publishing season. And for that, we would need a manuscript in 6 months. Do you feel up to the task? Yes, you can trust him on that, he always meets deadlines. He's a hard-worker. Six months sound good. We'll start with an option. An option means that if we're not satisfied or if you don't meet deadlines, we're out. Yes, of course. Perfect. Just sign here. - Thank you. - No, thank you. Here. That's great. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See you soon. - See you real soon. Awesome. Hello. Fabrice? - Yes. - Have a good night. Minus 843. TAKE 5 MORE RIDES TO EARN 20 EUROS Fuck! URGENT! I LOCKED MYSELF OUT! Shit. Sorry. You've reached Elisa Rollet. Please leave a message. It's me. I wanted to talk to you, hear your voice. I'll call you later. Take care. Well done. Congratulations. Thanks. But you should've been published first, you know that. That's stupid. How are you? - You're still with Vincent? - Yeah. - How is it going? - It's going. - So everything's good? - Everything's great. Thank you for coming. - How are you? - I'm always good when I see you. I'll let you rest. Good night. Trains are getting more and more expensive. That's why I missed Eid. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Tell me, Bibi, do you have a girlfriend? I liked it when you used to bring home knockouts. They were terrific. I don't know how you do it with that face. Your mom and I did everything right, but we screwed you up a little. - Is that so? - Yes. We screwed you up. You can't get everything right. What are you doing here? I don't cough anymore. I told you I could start. Can we enjoy being together? I'm not here often. That's the problem. - That's me. I gotta go. - Wait, wait. Meet me after class. I'll text you the address. Come and then we can never see each other again. - Hello. - Hello. - I'll have a coffee. - OK. Thank you. Have a seat. Thank you. Where were you? Mom, meet Elisa. - Hello. - Hello. - Dad, come here. - Nice to meet you. You too. Fatma. And this is my dad, Jacques. It's Elisa. Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - I'll give you a kiss. - Why don't we all sit down? - Yeah. She doesn't wear the hijab. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. I usually have it on, but I didn't want to offend you. - Now I know why you came to Lyon. - Yeah... Hello. You have customers. Yes! I'll be right back. I'm gonna kill you! You could've told me. - You're crazy. - Yes. We're here. - Should I take off my shoes? - If you want to. But I haven't vacuumed. - I'm glad to be here. - I'm glad you're here. Can I kiss you? - Shit. - Who is it? I'm sorry. Pretend I'm not here. - What are you doing? - Shush. - Alekseï. - Shush. - Come out of the shower. - Shush. Come out. I'm gonna kill him. - Alekseï. - Shut up. What are you doing? Come out of the shower. It's ridiculous. I'm coming out. Hello. - Elisa? - Alekseï? Himself. I'm a loser. I'm sorry. I was with my Tinder date, but she kicked me out after the first beer. So here I am. - Well... hi. - What are you doing? Hi. - You make my friend happy. - Move! Which makes me happy too. HE SOUNDS LIKE A LAWNMOWER... HE CAN'T FIND AN APARTMENT? HE'S LOOKING. BUT I WANT TO FIND A PLACE AND LIVE WITH YOU. Do you? Yeah. You called? Stop. - Thank you, my love. - You can put salt. Thank you for this meal. Please. I suck. I'm sorry. I like that. - What is this music? - It's life. Hallelujah life then! - Hi. - Hi. - Have a good one. - You too. - Hi. Thanks. - Bye. Hi. - Clémence, right? - Yes. - Here. - Thanks, perfect. Labidi? Is that you? - What are you doing here? - You know him? Yeah, from college. Labidi, this is Clémence. - Nice to meet you, Clémence. - You too. I gotta go. Wait. How long have you been doing this? - It's for my novel. - OK. To get into character and everything. Very contemporary. Yeah, well... Do you want to take a break? We ordered enough food for four. No, I appreciate it, but... I have to keep up the pace otherwise it's cheating. - But let's get a drink later. - Totally. - Bye. - Bye. Dad, do you think your accountant could blow up your salary? Of course. I can't be a good guarantor with 1,200 euros a month. Thanks. It's on the second floor. There's a lot of you, so we're going to view it two by two. While you're waiting, stay outside, not in the hall, out of respect for the neighbors. And at the end of the tour, if you're interested, leave me your application. Excuse me. I don't have a paper application. You don't? I don't think it's very green, but I can email it to you. Hang on, if you're too cheap to pay 2 euros to print out your application, that's not my problem. So since you're eco-friendly, I suggest you walk home and maybe come back some other time. Are there others like her or are we good? OK, great. Let's start the tour. - Amber? - Amber. You're really cute. Yeah, sometimes. I found an apartment. It's clean, bright, it has wooden floors, moldings and toilets. You look surprised. It's ours. I'm signing tomorrow. Are you happy? I want to live with you. The two of us, all the time. It's furnished. But it's great, isn't it? Yeah, really great. Isn't it too expensive? - 1,200 euros. - 1,200! I can handle it. Yeah, of course. So, do you like it? It's amazing, it's great. It's beautiful. What are you doing here? - Is your dad here? - No, he's at work. What's going on? I don't know. I don't think I can do it. - You wanted this apartment. - I don't know. We talked about it in Paris, you were on board. I don't get it. We made a decision, we can't give up at the first difficulty. Why did you leave? Maybe you don't believe in relationships, but I don't care, just believe in me. I'll do everything to make you happy, I don't want to hurt you. We didn't talk about it. You talked about it and you never asked me what it felt like to leave, to move to a different city, to live together with you when I've always lived with my dad. And this place is not my home. You chose it by yourself, you chose the furniture, I... You don't ask me for anything. If the problem is the apartment, we can find another one. - I thought it would make you happy. - It does. Then what? You want your stuff? Let's take your stuff. - Let's take this. - It's my dad's. The bunny is your dad's? To be honest, I can't afford it. I can't give you my half of the rent, I don't have any money. I said yes, because I thought we wouldn't find a place. Are you kidding? I came all the way here. - Next time, text me, it'll be cheaper. - I'm serious. So am I, Elisa. I promised we would move in together, let me handle it. You focus on school, I'll pay the full rent. Once you pass your exam, you'll chip in. You shouldn't have to do this. I'll do it, it's not a problem. Deal? - Don't you need to study? - Give me that. Talk to me about history. You were studying Rome or something, with the Pubic War. What? I was studying the Punic War, the second one. - The second Punic War? - Yeah. There were two Punic Wars? - Basically... - Damn. - Come on. - Everything's fine, I promise. Like I said at the beginning, whether you're young or old makes no difference. The question is: how to make money? How to make lots of money quickly? We can play the lottery. Don't be stupid. We can play Astro scratch-offs. - What? - Astro. You pick your sign. We don't need luck right now, we need a concrete solution. What are you watching? How to get into stock exchange. With algorithms, we can make a lot of money. But we need a loan. And what I'm saying is stupid? At least I'm being realistic. - It's very realistic. - Yeah, right. You just don't know anything about it. That guy's not an author. Shoes. Shoes. Yes! Yes, sounds good. You must be joking. No way! Take him for a sec. They're not going to hire that idiot. He can't even write his own name. I swear. Can you imagine? Fuck him. And fuck them all. Yes, of course. No, he's not an author either. Listen... Great. Yes, I'll call you back. Ciao, ciao. Take care. Do you recognize Labidi, Michel? No, you don't. How's life? Good, I imagine. You haven't sent me anything in two months. - Do you have something better to do? - Don't worry, I'm working. You do. Could you give me an advance that I'll pay you back when we sign? Oh my God, you're in love. Let me tell you, you're screwed. But being in love has never been a job. Is it a job? - It's not a job. - See? It's very simple, the faster you write, the sooner you get paid. - Hello? - What's wrong? Nothing. I wanted to hear from my son, is that forbidden? I'm actually doing wonderful. - That's good to hear. - Is everything OK? Why wouldn't it be? I'm fine. - Are you working? - Yes, I'm writing. - How's it going with dad? - We're good. - Have you talked to him recently? - No, why? Stop assuming there's always a problem. He's working less and spending more time at home. We have more free time so he's in great shape. We even made crepes yesterday. I'll let you get back to work. - Give Elisa a kiss for me. - I will. - Love you. - Love you too. - Bye. - Bye. Why can't I read it? Because it's not very interesting. You're writing your book so that people can read it. - It will be published. - I don't know. You think I'm not going to read it when it's out? I read the short story that got an award. You read the short story? I thought it was great. "The current balance of your account does not allow us to process the deduction from Immo Voltaire. We are offering you a 17-day delay to make up the deficit on your account." - Axel? - Yeah. - Labidi? - Yeah. Nice to meet you. How's it going? Here. It looks good. - Thanks. - Perfect. - And the money? - Yeah, sorry. The money. Here. Awesome. Have a good one. - You too. - See you. To sum up: an iPad Air worth 570 euros and a Kodak F7X digital camera worth 450 euros. But you did not witness the theft. No, I was having a drink and when I went to pay, my bag was gone. Do you know the race of the thief? Caucasian, Mediterranean, African? What do you mean? If you think an Arab did it, you should tell us, sir. I don't know, my bag got stolen, I didn't see anything. Very well. We'll leave it at that then. Great. - Have a good day, sir. - You too. How is literature? There are ups and downs, as you can imagine. Our country depreciates its culture. What is the purpose of your call? Is there a problem with your account? As I was telling you, we are going through a restructuring and we have a new accounting department. They are now paying us on the 9th of each month, so I was wondering if you could deduct the rent on the 10th. That's it? Absolutely. Have a good day. Yes. Perfect. Thank you very much. My hero! We just have to wait for the insurance money now. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Could I have a cigarette? - Of course. I appreciate it. And what's your name? I'm Lola. - Lola? - Yes, but... It's very pretty. But I have someone, I'm sorry. You have someone. - Give a kiss to someone for me then. - Will do. Hi. I'm Alekseï. - Hi. - Hi. Why? Fuck! You motherfucker! - Hey. - What's up? - Say "what". - What? I'm signing the sales agreement next week. You didn't hear me. I'm signing the agreement next week. What? Two bedrooms, continuous balcony, facing south... A real gem. You know what I'd like? For fate to bring me a gorgeous and amazing girl, a girl I can share passions with. You know my passions: comedy, cycling. Why does it only happen to me? - Still haven't heard from your ex? - No. I feel lonely since you left. How's Elisa? "... will transfer to your account a total of 1,625 euros." You know what? To make it up to you, it's on me. - How are you? - Great. - This is Hyacinthe. - Nice to meet you. A mock exam isn't nothing, right? Mock exams are always harder. - You'll have a better grade. - See? To Elisa. Welcome, Hyacinthe. Welcome. I have to take a piss. - What do you do? - I'm at the conservatory. Awesome! For dance, theater... - Theater. - Theater. But I also dance. Are you into dance? No. I dated an actor for a while, but that's it. This song is for Elisa, whom I love more than anything and who got a B+ at her mock exam. I want to say that a mock exam is not nothing. Please applaud her. Thank you. Bravo! We have to support our students, our youth. You will forget all those days, all those times That were just ours Those mornings when you were holding me tight And the love we used to make everywhere You will forget All the pain you're feeling when you see me suffer Those hard times when you don't know what to say And all there is to do is leave You will forget The smile, the looks that meant forever All those words we swear to never forget You will forget You will forget You will forget your restless waiting Holding on to your phone The first date I finally accept one night The night that changed my whole life You will forget if it was in April, September or July If the sun was shining or if rain was falling You will forget Don't you have a novel to write? Labidi? What's going on? Nothing, I'm fine. Careful, it hurts. What's wrong? I tried throwing myself under a truck to get insurance money, but it didn't work. They called an ambulance. They thought I wanted to kill myself. That's it. I'm fine, don't worry. I just need some rest. Can you take it off? - Hello? - No! - It's me. - How are you? Did you just transfer me money? Elisa called us. - Why did you do that? - We couldn't leave you like that. - But you don't have any money. - We're your parents. I'm getting by. You should take care of yourselves. You have to accept our help sometimes. When we can give you money, we do. I don't want you to bleed yourselves dry for me. We're not bleeding ourselves dry. We didn't know what to do with that money. - We even bought ourselves chickens. - Chickens? Yes. One of them even reminds me of you. So stop worrying. Really. You have to tell us when you have a problem. I tried, but I can't. That's just how it is. In our family, we don't give up at the first obstacle. You will succeed. - Are you OK? Not too nervous? - No, I'm good. Good. I'm gonna be casual with you. That's just the way we do things. No fuss. We're cool. I received tons of applications, but I selected yours because you have a unique profile. First, you went to college. That's dope. And you know about culture. Customers who come here are exactly like that. They're very Parisian, very cultivated. You'll know how to talk to them. It's essential to hit it off with the customer. It's our brand's DNA, we're friendly. A: we're eco-friendly, all our frames our biodegradable. And B: we're human-friendly, because for every pair that we sell, we give one to the destitute. It's crucial to emphasize that, because that's what matters today. Kindness. - It sounds naive, but it's important. - OK. - Any questions? - No. Could you give me three of your strengths? I think it's a lame question. It makes me uncomfortable. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. That's why we want you. Cultivate that difference. Don't change. - Can you start today? - Yes. Great. - It's minimum wage. - Yes. - You knew that. - Yes. But with bonuses, the more you sell, the more you earn. - Hello. - Hello. - I'll let you browse. - Yes, thanks. You're welcome. - Suzanne? - Yeah? - There's a customer. - Is there a problem? - Do you want to handle him? - Not at all. Why? - You're part of the team now. - OK. Just be cool and friendly, start a conversation... Give him that. - It always works. - OK. Just be cool. - Focus. - Yeah. Money. A cup of coffee? No, thank you. It's free, no strings attached. I don't drink coffee. I didn't have one this morning, so it's perfect. What do you do, sir? I'm a publisher. Really? Literature or editorial? - Literature. - Awesome. At which publishing firm? Éditions de Minuit. Do you know it? Of course, I do. I read a lot of Tanguy Viel. His last book just came out, Iceberg. Have you read it? - Not yet. - We're really happy with the sales. These are nice. The shape is nice and they look good on me. - They're great. - What do you think? - They're going to help you sell books. - I sure hope so. - Safety, pride, novelty. - Labidi? Comfort, money, friendliness. There's no one in the store, so let's evaluate your techniques. - Ready? - Yes. What do you do with a red consumer insight? Red means they're in a hurry. They want concrete things and think they know it all. - I think these look good. - So do I. I mimic their body language, I present arguments without contradicting them. - Exactly. You let them win. Yellow? - The yellow consumer is emotional. They're looking for originality and think they have an artistic personality, so I bond with them to win their trust. - I like these. - They remind me of The Beatles. - You were well trained. - Yes. Why do we do all that? To make money. The woman from 239 gave you her number, which means you did a good job, man. Evening. Are you still open? Evening. Yes, come in. I'm looking for a special pair of glasses, because I'm very short-sighted. Do you have any advice? You should try on this pair, with leopard prints. - Great. - It will suit you. Let's see that. Oh hell no! They look horrible. - Don't take it personally, but... - Try these on. - I'm gonna go. - Try them. OK, I'll trust you. Let's see. Let me see. Not bad. You're good! Seriously. It's cute. Really cute. Is your manager here? Don't go. It's OK. - I'm sorry, it's annoying. - No, don't worry. - I can't get hard. - It's not the ideal place. Don't worry. I'm sorry. It's OK. - I don't know what's going on. - Don't worry. I'm tired. - Don't touch me! - Stop! Stop! - What are you doing? - Get the fuck out! - What are you talking about? - What is that? Labidi, what is that? It's nothing. Then why did you keep it? I don't trust you! Take your stuff and get out! I'm at work all day and you know I could never do that, so stop. Yeah, right. Get out of here. Get up! Enough! Stop! I do everything for you! Everything! So stop! Let go of me! You're hurting me! What's wrong with you? You want to leave? You'd rather be alone than in a useless relationship? Then leave. Fuck! Oh come on... - Great. They're brand new? - Yeah, brand new. - 40 euros? - Yep. - Thanks. - Bye. Have a good one. Don't apologize, asshole. What? You're in the middle of the street. You got a problem? My problem is you and your hipster friends. You're the fucking hipster, with your girl. - Enough. Stop it! Come on, stop. Let go of him! Elisa? "I'm going to my mom's. "You need time for yourself. "We need to be able to be apart." Can you come in? I'd like to be done before tomorrow. I already spend my life here. Yeah, sorry. LABIDI, I'M NOT MAD. WE JUST BOTH NEED TIME. You've reached Elisa Rollet. Leave a message and I'll call you back. I wanted to know what you were up to. MONDAY - TUESDAY - WEDNESDAY THURSDAY - FRIDAY - SATURDAY You've reached Elisa Rollet. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Philippe! Hi. I'm gonna go. Yeah, thanks. - I'll call you. - Yeah. My dad died. My father died. Yesterday. No, the day before. I'm not sure exactly. I'm in the aftermath that I thought would never come. My father died and I wasn't the son he deserved. I didn't try. Bibi. Habibi. His incapable son. The youngest, temperamental and arrogant. My father died. I don't remember telling him I loved him. - Listen. - What? - Doesn't it ring a bell? - It does. What a memory. My arm hurts. - Are you ready? - Come here. What are you doing? Just remember. You're funny. I hope I'll learn how to love like him. My father married my mother, loved her God and took her name, for her flaws, in which he saw rarity. My father died and I couldn't save him. We have to open the bar. My mother is Tunisian. You can't tell by looking at me. My name is my only bond with my origins. Hi. What can I get you? My mom tried to erase the traits of the immigrant's son, to avoid the issues of her time. I am a class bastard, a class defector, a transclass, a hipster mostly, a prole too, a destitute, who pretends to live like the rich. I have the time high salaries allow, but the urgency of the humblest. I have the perspective and cynicism of one class on another and the ambition of believers. I don't belong to anything, it's a contemporary affliction. This urgent emptiness in which we are drowning. I've become everything I hated. A certain idea of culture as proof of intelligence. I'm the rich's buffoon. They ask me about my precariousness to finally see it exists. There is no pleasure in stealing, no satisfaction in cheating. To get by, you must have energy. Just between us, they wanted to fire you. I defended you, I said: "He's an amazing salesman. "People really trust him. "And the numbers are here to prove that." So you're staying, but not getting your bonus. You left the store in the middle of the afternoon. You didn't come for three straight days. That can't happen. You realize that, right? You have to prove yourself again, to show us that the brand is your family, that you can trust us, that you can talk to us, that we're together. We're 100 % behind you, OK? Let's get to work. It's gonna be fine. Go get 'em! THE WORLD AFTER US Let's be honest, you think I'm a fool. We have an option with a publisher, you write a great novel and then you send me that. It's a piece of shit. You should've started a blog. Do you really think people want to read that? We all have problems. And Christine Angot made sure the niche is exhausted. And here you come... That's what I want to do. I feel more comfortable. So maybe it sucks, but I'm happy with it. If you don't want to do it, I'll ask someone else. You're smart! You know I have to send it. I can't let an option slip away. What are publishers going to think of me? And where does that shitty title come from? Did you think you were making a French independent film? If you don't like it, I'll just go. No, it belongs to me. It's mine. It's my property. Even if it's a piece of shit, it's mine. I own a piece of shit. Elisa. I wish I could say I was wrong about her when I met her, that I thought she was ugly, but I didn't. She was beautiful and I immediately fell for her. Elisa was lying on her stomach. I lay down next to her and held her tight. I didn't want to let her go. I've got you, I protect you, I'm by your side. I'm not leaving, not letting you go. Our story is a common disease. I will love it till the end. I love you. I love you. What's up? What's wrong? It's Hyacinthe. - She's not answering. - How long has it been? Two hours. Two hours? It doesn't mean anything. I think about her more than she does. Do you want to be my best man? You're getting married? You idiot. When is the wedding? In two weeks. - That's fast. - It is. What did you expect? I'm surprised. - Congratulations. - Thank you. This isn't conventional. I've never seen such a reversal, ever. But I have to say, I'm very impressed. It was a long shot. Autofiction is a genre that constantly needs to be reinvented. And here, the contemporaneity of the situations and their immanent character sublime the words. The coming elections are going to showcase the novel as a testimony of today's youth. And we're in great need of that right now. That's exactly what I told him. I was very surprised. But when I read it, I thought I had to send it to you. We're going to start with a small print run, to see if it takes. And if the novel meets its readership, we'll do a bigger print run, with more communication. That sounds great. Please, take a seat. Good morning everyone. Thank you for being with us this morning, in this city hall, the house of the republic, the house of the people, the house of liberty, equality and fraternity, but also of social harmony, of what allows us to gather and unite. And is there a more beautiful union than the one we are celebrating? We are celebrating the union of Labidi El Morchedi... Morning, sir. You are an author. How romantic! You were born on December 21st 1990, in Cergy, Val-d'Oise. You are the son of Jacques François El Morchedi né Reville, whom all our thoughts go to this morning, and Fatma El Morchedi. Morning, ma'am. You are marrying, what a wonderful idea, Elisa Rollet. You are a student. You were born on July 13th 1997 in Lyon, Rhône. My regards to the people from Lyon. You are the daughter of Denis Rollet and Marion Dorine Henry, divorced. That's what love is, you can fall in and out of it, like Alicia Keys sang. Your best man is Alekseï Kouyenski. Morning, sir. You are a digital asset manager. And your maid of honor is May Maupas. You are a student. We of course need all of those who study. I will ask you to come forward for this clearly very moving moment.

I do. Ms. Elisa Rollet, daughter of Denis Rollet and Marion Dorine Henry, do you take as your lawfully wedded husband Mr. Labidi El Morchedi, son of Jacques François El Morchedi né Reville and Fatma El Morchedi? - I do. - I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss. Love is so beautiful when it is shared. Ms. Elisa and Mr. Labidi, you are now going to exchange rings. We don't have rings. This couple is original. It is very touching. The most beautiful proof of love is that you are here this morning, in front of your family and friends. Let's celebrate with a drink. Thank you. Here they are! - It's a pleasure. - The pleasure's mine. And Benjamin, I imagine. Nice to meet you. Why are people in love Always kind of the same? They have, when they walk up to you The same look of a sole desire for two They are happy people Why are people in love Always kind of the same? When they have their problems There is nothing to say Nothing to do for them They are people in love And I hardly know you... The first copy. It arrived this morning. Congratulations.

It's a problem.
