Heaven sent To someone like you To someone like Hodder To someone like me You wouldn't believe it - - but it all started when I put up a poster. Just a sheet from dad's car poster. That's how it started. My name is Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen. I'm an ordinary boy who lives with his dad. Nice work, Hodder. I think it looks like a flower. It's a fairy. Or a bird, maybe. - No, a fairy. Right, then. Right on, team! - Right on, team! We have no mum. That's to say dad has no wife - - so of course I've no mum either. Dad puts up posters at night. Car posters, travel posters, all kinds of posters. I can hear his motorbike long after he's turned the corner. I like rum whirls. I eat the outside in the daytime - - and save the middle bit for the night. Inside we're all the same. The same way as on the outside we're all so different. Eh, Hodder? Inside we're all the same, Miss Asta K. Yes! And the fascinating thing - - is that every single organ has it's own job to do On the outside we're different, but inside we're all the same. Me, and Filip who can tackle so your bones sing, - - and Alex, who's got style We've all got hearts, lungs, kidneys. Even Kamma from Iceland. Look! - No, Kamma Gudmundsdottir! This is what a sheep's kidney really looks like. We eat them raw in Iceland. - Put it back into your lunch box! That's the way it is. That's what's so strange about us. Having to sit next to you, Hodder I was born under an unlucky star. And I was born in hospital. I came into the world with my navel wound seven times round my neck. The midwife said I was destined for greatness. What are you at now, Hodder? Just getting hold of this. - Wow! Hodder's rescued a conker! Filip, come on! Not that I mind the others. I just prefer walking home alone. Of course that's what I've got used to. Learn anything at school today? - Yes. That we must learn to cope. Within and without. Yes, that's always useful. One thing at a time, though. Look, I'm 50 are short. I've been told new prices. Bring it next time, then. There she sits, waiting. You never know where love will strike, - - she once told me. Know what I was thinking? How about a new kitchen? We could do with some bright, new colours. Whoops! Out with the old and in with the new! You didn't think I dared, eh? Just look at that wallpaper My goodness! OK, then There. - You didn't stick that up very well. I think your mother put it up. How about a new wife? In a moment dad will say he needs a thinking break. We both need a thinking break, eh? Hodder? I'm sure he'd like a new wife. But he works while all the possibilities are asleep. SLEEP YOUR WAY TO DREAMLAND Stop the car here and don't run all those kids over! Don't talk to me like that, OK? No harm in your son hearing how we're getting on. Drive on - Don't shout at Filip. Get out, Filip. Remember your school bag. Don't slam the door. Drive on! Hi, Filip Now for a really interesting gland. The pancreas is a gland - - that produces a secretion that enables us to digest - - our food. And another thing Kamma, put that thing back into your bag, it isn't lunchtime I just wanted to demonstrate digestion. This is an ordinary bit of food that we eat in Iceland. Smoked sheep's brain. Do you feel ill, Miss Asta K? OK, we know who to thank for that. It's like that in any class. One person always gets the blame. In my class it happens to be me. Hodder as usual. We come here to learn and we can't do that if you hold up our lessons. So go and tell her you're sorry. Show you've got style. Go on! Miss Asta K? - What are you doing out here? It's lesson time. Is something the matter? Have you something to say? Yes. You smell. You smell nice. "You smell"? Is that what you said? Is that what it says? All I said was that she smelled. You should probably have said you liked her scent. I did say she smelled nice. But it only made her crosser. Women are sometimes hard to work out. She smelled nice, did she? - Nothing wrong with her smell. Interested? - Get out of those wet clothes. Or you'll catch a cold. Hodder? Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen? Hodder you have been chosen. To save the world. Would you mind coming back another day? You are the Chosen One. You must save the world. But I live on my own with dad. Ask Filip from school instead. He's much stronger than me. And he's got a dad and a mum. But you are the Chosen One. It's you who must save the world. Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen. Where have you gone? If you weren't asleep - - I'd tell you a fairy came to see me in the night See you. dad. Hi, Filip. Know what happened last night? Aren't you going to school? - Of course I am. Go on then! Get a move on, Hodder! OK? Go on! - If you drive I'll walk. Behave like a grown up in front of your son. Coming, Filip? Or are you going to walk, too? I'm coming, mum. Not a word about this to anyone. - About what? Hey, Filip? I didn't tell you what happened last night. A fairy? Could she talk? Oh, yes. She told me I had to save the world. And that I was the Chosen One. She said my whole name. Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen. Come on, Hodder. Sit down, will you? It was a very strange night. I could smell her perfume all the way to the staff room. If I ever get a new mum I'll give her a 10 litre can of that perfume. STAFF ROOM Excuse me? - Hodder? Can I ask you something? - About the fairy? Hodder says a fairy came to him last night. No, I just wanted to ask you about your perfume. My perfume? Yes. What's it called? Hodder, I'd better have a word with you. Hodder, last week you asked me if I was lonely on Sundays. And of course I'm not. - No, of course not. You also asked me if I'd had my gall stones out. Yes. - Yes. As regards my perfume, - - I consider it absolutely my own business. It's of no concern to anybody, let alone a pupil. So from now on, Hodder, no more peculiar questions, eh? No more. In fact, in future don't say anything at all. Not a word. Understand? Not a word, Hodder. OK, Miss Asta K. Hey! I'm sorry if I was a bit harsh. My perfume's none of your business. But if you must know, it's called Harem Dreams. Harem Dreams? - Yes. I once saw it on a silly poster at the airport. I like the way ladies smell. Harem Dreams. They're English words. Harem Dreams. What are harem dreams? Harems are things they have in Arabia. Arabs are allowed to have lots of wives. And the place where the wives live is called a harem. Anything else you'd like to know? Would you like to be one of the wives? No! Goodness me, no! That will do. Come on! I think my dad would like it. - Really. It smells like rum whirl. Sorry, wrong wrist. It's called Harem Dreams. It means a kitchen with lots of women in. Well, it does smell of women, it certainly does. A bit cloying I don't think I could get used to it, Hodder. Asta K would like to be part of a harem and work in the kitchen. I'm sure she would, but I think we'll take a perfume break, all right? OK? MUM Hi, mum, happy birthday. We're fine. Dad's started doing the kitchen. I don't think it'll take long now. And apparently I've got to save the world. A fairy came. A real, live fairy. With wings and all. Come on, Hodder, we're going. We've only just got here. I haven't finished. Yes, but we're going. Come on. It's not that he doesn't want to talk to you; he misses you. Bye, mum. See you. Hodder, you haven't saved the world yet; why not? I can't. The world is much too big - - and nobody at school believes me. They'll believe you. I promise. You do? - The world isn't too big for you. You'll manage. How? You are the Chosen One. - In that case tell me how! How? Hodder? Dad? Yes? - How would you save the world? Goodness, that's a bit of a mouthful. Have you got to save the world, then? Yes, I think so. That's what the fairy said. Oh, yes. The fairy. First I'd probably mount an expedition. Made up of good mates of mine. But first of all I'd get some sleep. The fairy came back, Big Mac Johnson. She kept saying I was the Chosen One. The fairy should ask Filip. He's already very chosen. Filip, do you fancy helping to save the world? How about acting normal? Just a piece of advice. It's a shame they can't be friends. - Who? Your mum and dad. I can't stand walking along with you. Did you hear me? So why don't you go? I am. Sorry, Filip. I'd only meant to ask him to save the world. Save the world? Well, I'll be Not exactly easy, eh? No. It's a bit of a mouthful. If it was me I'd start in a small way. Yes. A small way. You still owe me 50 are. Hey, fairy! Are you there? Hey! The world is much too big. Even Denmark. Can't I start in a small way? If you're not here in 10 seconds I'll take it that that's OK. 1,2,3,- -4,5,6,- -7,8,Q,- -10. Right. I'll assume it's OK. Guambilua Guambilua. Guambilua. The smallest populated island in the Indian Ocean. The inhabitants live on fish. They believe that one day a great man will come to save them. Dear Guambilua, - - I'm not quite in our school photo - - because they made me hold the sign. So I'm sending you my boots. When you see them walk up you'll know salvation is nigh. Watch out for my boots. Fly, plane, fly to Guambilua! What are you doing out so late? I'm sorry, but I was just sending this to Guambilua. Come over here. She has a lovely voice. Like in the ads. Like a film star. What's your name? - Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen. My name's Lola. Hi, Hodder. Lola? Is that all? Lola the lady without a surname. - Do your parents mind? Your being out in the middle of the night? I'm at home alone. My mum died when I was three. And dad puts posters up at night. A fairy has told me I've got to save the world. I'm starting with Guambilua. I'll go with you to Guambilua. - Guambilua If you promise me a window seat and a few cool dudes, I'm in. I know some cool dudes. Filip and Alex. But I don't know if they'll come. - No harm in asking. P.S. I am mounting an expedition. Second time lucky. Hey, Alex? Want to come on an expedition? - What expedition? To Guambilua. They're waiting for a saviour. Hi, Alex, have you heard about Filip's mum and dad? Why should we care? Hey! Before we go, we'll hear the result of the class poll. Kamma was kind enough to count the votes. Thank you, Alex. I have counted and I have counted. I may say it was a tough contest. We'll start with The Strongest Pupil of the Year. It was Filip! Filip, will you come up here for your prize? Well done! - Thank you. And now for the Brainiest Pupil of the Year. The winner Right on, team And tonight there's a dessert. - ls there? I won a bag of acid drops. In the class contest. I didn't know there was one. - For "standing out". So I won this. It's great. Well done! - Thanks. Alex was the brainiest and Filip was the strongest. And what were you? The most imaginative? No, the ugliest. The ugliest? Yes. I got the same prize as the others. You're not ugly, Hodder. Calling you ugly is just plain stupid. Do you think they're done? - Know what? I reckon you should help me put posters up tonight. Heaven sent To a boy like you To a boy like Hodder To a boy like me Heaven sent to everyone Who could do With a little wishing fairy A little wishful dream A little wishing fairy To go with us on our way A little wishing fairy A little wishful dream A little wishing fairy To go with us on our way And looks down from where Fairies flutter 'midst the moon clouds Till evening comes And love winks When we see it right in front of us And it's Heaven sent Heaven sent HEAVEN SENT Thanks that was the last acid drop. Can you fly to Guambilua? Where exactly is Guambilua? Far out to sea. If they've got a runway, yes. Or you could just drive. You can't drive on water. You can when it's silver. Silver? - It means the sea is thinking. And when the sea is thinking the wind drops. Everything is still. And then you can drive across it. At other times - - it's green. That means it's sad. Green? Yes. And at other times the sea is blue. And we all dream. Dream, Hodder! What are you dreaming? - That I get a car like that. And mount an expedition. And drive on water. Hodder? I think she's really pretty. Your mum. And know what? You're just as good-looking. In a few years nobody will dare call you ugly. No more free acid drops, then. - Yes. That's true. No more free acid drops. Get him, Filip! Get him, Bo! Get him, Filip! Get him, Bo! Stop it at once! Come with me. - Let go! Straight to the headmaster. - It was just as much him. Headmaster - school psychologist I don't want to talk to anyone. - Nor do I. He'd better not give me grief. - No. He said mum and dad were splitting up. Did you sneak, Hodder? Are you the one who sneaked? - No. If I ever find out you did, I'll beat you up. My mum and dad aren't splitting up and you know it. What did you want? - To ask you on an expedition. Where to? Guambilua, the smallest island in the world. Have you no friends at all? - I've a few. Who? - Lola, for example. Nobody else? - Then there's my dad. But he doesn't really count, does he, Filip? Want to come? OK, Hodder. If you tell the headmaster it was you who was fighting. See you. You are weird. What are you doing here? - I've been fighting. I'd never have expected that from you, Hodder. Jolly good! Let them have it! Oh, no I'd better write a note for you to take home. And Filip says he'll come? - Yes. Stay here and count to 500. Then come out. OK, Alex. Remember 500! OK. Come here! Come on! Me and Filip will go on your expedition. But who else is going? - Someone called Lola. Who's Lola? - A pretty lady who likes cool dudes. How long will it take? - Roughly? I think we can do it in a week. - We'll meet to plan it. OK. - Tomorrow at 3? At Hodder's? Can you make it, Hodder? - Yes, of course. Make a good supply of rum clusters. Remember the ones on his birthday? Tomorrow at 3. At Hodder's. See you, Hodder. The expedition Lola, Hodder, Filip, Alex. Remember: rope, torch, compass, mosquito repellent, - - sensible clothes. Hi. Lola! - Hi! How are you doing? - I've got some cool dudes. We've got a meeting tomorrow at 3. Coming? I don't think I can make it. But say hi to the others. Bother! We may end up fighting with them. - I only want one. No way. They'll be here in 20 minutes. - OK. I've got to go out. Can you manage? Or would you like me to stay to say hello? You can go, dad. Do you know who that is? Hey! Hey, Alex? I live over there. I don't have that much time to talk. I need a new horn. - Will you come up after that? No, I'll have to test the new horn. Excuse the mess. It's because Filip's dad is moving his stuff out. It's good you came. Filip's in there. He's not very happy. Filip? Filip? A visitor. Right cheerio. Are you upset? - No, are you? No, I just thought we had a meeting. At my place. At 3. Never mind, though. It's just the sea being green. You what? The sea's sad, so everyone else is. So no wonder you didn't feel like a meeting. Doesn't anything get through to you? We were having you on. That expedition sounded just a bit too weird. I know why you say so. It's because your dad is moving out. If you ever say that again I'll really beat you up. And I'll be watching out to make sure you don't tell anyone else. Hi. - Hi. Why didn't you eat the rum clusters? Maybe you went out to play instead? - Yes, we were outside. Was it fun? - Yes. These rum clusters are perfect. For throwing. No! Stop it! No! Right! Right then. We were going to do the kitchen anyway. I've been out to supper three days in a row with mum and dad. How was your weekend, Filip? - I spent it with mum and dad. But they're splitting up. That's what I'd heard. It's not true. - I hear your dad's moved out. Who told you? - Loads of people. It wasn't me. Hodder! You sneaked about my dad! Hey, Hodder? How's the world saving going? - Not too well. It's not exactly easy. - No. Maybe we shouldn't bite off more than we can chew. But dreams don't cost anything, do they? They don't cost anything. I think somebody's waiting for you. Shall we share my rum whirl? You can have the middle. Eat it yourself. Eat it! I've got to run. We're celebrating because it's Friday. We're having beef burgers. - Stop! What's that? My wristwatch. It's a lady's watch. I inherited it. It's wrong. The date, too. It's not working at all. - No. It's stopped. You wear a lady's watch that's stopped? So I can remember the date. - You what?! So I can remember the date. Why aren't you eating? Eat up. How's school? - Fine. If something's wrong, say so. It's no good bottling it up. What about your mates? Isn't that Filip bloke OK? Actually he's standing right down there. He's what? - Standing in the street. In the rain? Why? Go down and bring him up. Tell him he can have some supper. Want to come up? We've lit our advent candle and we're having beef burgers. You'll catch your death of cold. I hate you, Hodder. I wasn't the one who sneaked about your father. Filip sends his regards. He's caught pneumonia - - and probably won't be back until Christmas. Now, the digestive system Hodder? Hodder, this is where it's at. The gut absorbs nourishment and vitamins. The parts of our food that the body doesn't need - - are transported onwards as waste. I'm going to show you something. - No, Kamma. Yes, Miss Asta K. This is actually sheep's gut. We call it "Mos sausage". True, these guts sometimes smell a bit iffy. Miss Asta K, may I suggest that you put your head between your knees? Oh, no! There, there, relax! I've got everything under control. All you hear is my voice. You are relaxing completely. All you hear is my voice. You can feel your heart beat slowing. You're relaxing completely. Deep, deep breaths. All you hear is my voice. When you wake up you'll love guts. Miss Asta K? Miss Asta K ...? I can wake her up. - Oh, no, you don't, Hodder. Wake up, Miss Asta K. Wake up to the loveliest perfume. Wake up to the scent of Harem Dreams. Hodder? Why am I lying down? Relax we've removed the guts from your belly. Hodder, you've done it again! SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST Come in. Do you know Guambilua? Should I? - No. Dear inhabitants of Guambilua, - - I am very sorry I haven't saved you yet. Filip and Alex had me on. Miss Asta K fainted and I saw the school psychologist. Lola is practically my only hope. Hodder? Are you game? - Game? I think so. For what? - Just come on down. OK. What now? - Hop in. The boxing meet, please. What about that trip of ours? I've got school. And I'm seeing the school psychologist. Surely you can get time off to save the world? What about my dad? - Oh, don't worry about him. It'll do him good to fend for himself a bit. Good evening and welcome, ladies and gentlemen - - to this titanic encounter. In the blue corner - - the reigning world champ, Melvin Doomsday Olsson! I'll crush him. And in the red corner - - tonight's courageous challenger, the poet of the ring, - - the man from the oatmeal packet, Big Mac Johnson. Today I'm the winner. I'll have you for dinner. I'll knock off your socks. I was born to box. Come and get it, man. I can box, I can. BOX! Watch his straight left. Watch it! He's deadly! Are we allowed? - As long as we don't ask. Well then? Can you hear me, you idiot? Anything you say I can hear With my ears, as you hear. Your eyes are clearing. The swelling's going down, too. You'll be all right. But what terrible rhymes! I've won the match. I'm a natch. You lost, you great narnah. I said watch his straight left. His straight left Was like a bombshell. Melvin's mean left Made Big Mac unwell. See you around, Big Mac. Hi, Big Mac. I like the way you rhyme. - I do it all the time. You were great. While it lasted. Ever heard of Guambilua? - Would a song title suit ya? Would you like to come on an expedition and save the world? We're starting with Guambilua but with you along we could go farther. I'm through with boxing I'll do more rhyming. Are you coming? - You couldn't be righter. The sooner the better. So we're on. You and me and Big Mac. Can I ask you a question? You've got one minute. And not about my perfume. The school psychologist says - - that Big Mac Johnson is a figment of my imagination. But look! WOW! And now I'd like a week off to go to Guambilua. Hodder, quite honestly I won't tell you fairies don't exist. But the fairy told me to save the world. Hodder, let me tell you A fairy once came to see me, too. Or possibly an elf. I was 9 years old and I had swimming. The elf told me I'd be the world champion. At breast stroke. - How fantastic! Yes, I was thrilled to bits. Until I realized it was a dream. - A dream? Yes, a dream, Hodder. Precisely. Think about it. It's not that I don't want to hang around with the kids from school. But I need a thinking break. And a dream break. And a save-the-world break. And a fairy break. I've been thinking. If I had to save the world, right? I wouldn't start in a small way after all. I'd start with me. Because there's plenty to work on. Have a lovely Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Oh, there you are! I'd like to start by saying - - that I'm not going. Christmas is coming. And I need to find a Christmas present for dad. And Miss Asta K says it was all a dream. And the bakery lady says I should start with me. You are the Chosen One. Excuse me, fairy, but is that all you can say? The world, Hodder. The world! The world! Look at me, Hodder! I don't know how to save the world. Look at me. There's not far to go. Far less than you think. But Guambiluafs a long way away. Guambilua'll make a good start. But Hodder, - - if you can't go to Guambilua perhaps Guambilua'll come to you. Mum? Look! - What's that? A conker fairy. - Oh, yes. Very good. Filip! Filip! You know it's the last day of term, right, Hodder? So we want our teacher to be happy. I hope you see that? So we've agreed you won't say a word in class. If you don't think you can manage that, you'd better go home now. I'll keep quiet. - Not just quiet. Invisible. Have you brought a candle and matches, Hodder? Is that a candle? I said "Is that a candle?" No. Let me see! Come on, give it to me! What the hell is this? - A conker fairy for Miss Asta K. You think she wants anything this ugly? We're meant to bring candles, not conkers. We don't want to see you without a candle. We do things in style. Style, Hodder. Can I borrow a candle? - Are you crazy? You think we're your babysitters? This is school. And you don't belong in our class. Go home. You've no style. Hey, Hodder! Give my regards to your mother. A child is born in Bethlehem Bethlehem Rejoice, Jerusalem Hallelujah, hallelujah Stop it! The water's silver. You can walk on it. No. - It's silver. It's green. It's sad. Do you hear? It's green. It's sad. Our suffering is now all gone Now all gone Today a saviour has been born Hallelu... Come in and sit down. We'll go on with our carol. - Just a moment! Hodder has forgotten his candle. - Didn't you bring a candle? So we told him he couldn't come. He can have mine. What about you? Now you've no candle. In the starry light blue sky Light blue sky To church we will now wend our way Hallelujah, hallelujah Football boots? You want football boots? Just beginner's boots. - I didn't know you played. Filip does. If you could have anything you wanted, what would you wish for? That I could put posters up in the daytime. Then we could spend much more time together. Come over here. Right on, team! - Right on, team, dad. I reckon you'd like a new wife as well. How about a really pretty one with high heels and red lips? I could make do with less. - Her name is Lola. Lola? But I doubt if she wants to get married. People don't all have to be married or to go outwith someone. Lots of them are quite happy with one dad or mum. Just look at us! Yes, just look at us! Yes, OK. How about some dessert? Hodder! Hodder! Hodder! Hodder? I thought it was you. This letter came ages ago. It landed outside our town hall. I'm the Chief of Guambilua. My name is William Ludo. You weren't easy to find. - No, it's a big city. And the world is even bigger. But I found you. Thank you, Hodder E. Jacobsen. - Merry Christmas, Hodder! What about our trip? - This is the Chief of Guambilua. We got this letter from Hodder. Our first ever. Letters are lovely. Big Mac Johnson! In my street! Upon this night, upon this night With no stars in the sky We stand here all together And gaze at Hodder on high Yes, Hodder deserves our thanks. He sent a letter - - across the great ocean. Now we know we're not forgotten. Thank you, Hodder! A thousand, thousand, thousand times over! Think nothing of it. - Want to come? To Guambilua? - Yes. Come with me. We're going the same way. We'd like to honour you. - Coming, Hodder? I'd better stay here. I'm going to see Filip. We'd really have liked to see you on Guambilua. But be happy, Hodder! Goodbye! Keep well! Farewell! Goodbye, Big Mac Johnson, poet of the ring. Goodbye, William Ludo, Chief of Guambilua. Goodbye, Lola, lady with no surname. You didn't go with them? No, this is where I belong. - Who are you talking to? Hi! My name's Lola. - Hi! I'm Hodder's dad. Hi, Hodder's dad! Hi. Right Hey, Lola? Yes? - Want to come up for dessert? Not that it's anything special. But we're getting a new kitchen. So will you come? Yes. I've nothing else to do, so OK!
