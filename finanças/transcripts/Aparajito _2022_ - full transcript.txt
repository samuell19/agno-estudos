'All India Radio.' [playing on radio continue] Please increase the sound, Vinku. Okay? - Yes. 'Now we start with 'Mukho-Mukhi.'.' In All India Radio, Kolkata's 'Mukho-Mukhi' program, - Keep quiet. sitting with us, is someone, whose first movie took Bengali and Indian movie scene to a permanent place in the international movie scene. With an apt name, 'Aparajito'. Welcome, Aparajito Ray. Greetings. APARAJITO (THE INVINCIBLE) Screenplay, Background music, illustration, dressing, while working on so many things, why suddenly you were excited to make a film like this? I was an avid movie watcher. But I never thought about making a film. But the main attraction of seeing a film was constantly increasing. I still remember. In Kalaniketan, I was working on the sketch of Palash and Silk-cotton tree. And at that time, Citizen Kane had released in Kolkata Halls. And it was just in the theatre for seven days. I couldn't see it. Okay, sir? - Try with lesser strokes. Later I started with a fun exercise. For example, if I learned that a famous novel is being turned into a film, I used to draft a skeleton screenplay from that book before seeing the movie. And while seeing the movie, I used to match what the director thought and what I did. You used to see movies, but how did you think of film society? Well... - Is dad inside the radio? Basically, we had the trend of watching Hollywood movies. - Quiet, quiet. Sit quietly. From various nations like Russia, Japan... And, of course, the numerous countries of Europe, amazing work was happening there in the local languages. And we were deprived of seeing those works. And few such like-minded friends became increasingly curious to see these works. You can also call them Cinephiles. Around that time I got hold of a book called Film by Roger Manvell. And it mentioned why not make a film society? And we all banded together to make film society of Calcutta. How long will it take? We could have gone to Russia and watched a movie and be back. Just wait, Sir. The projector looks like something from the Cold War. If you had shown this excitement and curiosity for your studies instead of a bioscope. My father is to be credited for my interest toward films. I don't need it. - What? Yes. From my childhood, movies were restricted in my household. Going to a cinema was like going to a bordello. Thus, I was extremely curious. We were only allowed to see mythological films. No adult films. Even other mythological films were not completely for kids. The way Gods and Goddesses were dressed... Exactly. And the divine dancers, no less than cabaret singers. This stigma related with cinema is still there. Trying to arrange a place to see films has led us to this condition. Either his house, or his uncle's verandah... And upon hearing the word film, they try to kick us out. A gentleman said. Cinema? What are you saying, Sir? Good people stay here with their wives and families. You're not really. And then he looked at me and said... listen, he looked at me and said. Even you look like you come from good family. And that was the day I was de-classed. And these houses are surrounded with so much ambient noise. Reciting poems, practicing songs, radio, news. A great thing happened that day. Along with the sound of a church bell in a silent film, nearby Kali temple's bells sound was completely In Sync. I am expecting Mr. Barin today, who might give us a permanent solution to our problem. Not just a place, we need so much more. Shubho, why don't you tell the story of prints of the film Battleship Potemkin? So I wrote a letter to the British Film Institute. To send a print of the film battleship. They were instantly ready and the film came as well. But we didn't know police would accompany the film as well. Police? - Police? Why was the police there? Why else, they must have received news from the postal department? And that launched an interrogation. What did you get from Russia? What movie? Whose movie? What is the subject of the film? I don't blame the police. Who knows if they heard of Einstein, Eisenstein is completely out of syllabus. And hearing that the film was based on naval mutiny, they were completely shocked. Yes. It took a lot to convince them that this won't be shown publicly. Before leaving, they warned me multiple times, see, we have strict orders. Are you a communist? Let's be careful, dear. I hope seeing the movie on October Revolution doesn't lead us to prison. Be careful. Communist Party would be banned any day. Yes, done. What? - When? What? - Not a ban, the projector is ready. Okay. - Let's start, then? I'll say let's wait a little, Mr Barin should be very shortly. He might be stuck due to some protest. There. - The Devil is here. See. Go. Am I too late? - No, please come. We welcome you to this mini auditorium of ours. Every seat is a balcony seat. - You're not late at all. It was just news reel till now. Okay. I hope I don't need to introduce him anew. Barin Bhowmick, the encyclopaedia of global movies. Nothing as such. Watching Bioscope is an addiction of mine, obsessive compulsive disorder. He's a Reputed member of our Film society from today. He is Chandragupta Kichlu all the way from heaven on earth, Kashmir. But he is a naturalized Bengali now, an artist. He has also worked as an art director in the film industry, but nothing noticeable, I assume. He's the famous Radhakanta Gupta, aka RK. Aka Mr. Bantul, Bibliophile, gastronome and the Kolkata antiquity. That's enough. Everyone knows him. He's a famous person. And he's the man behind the inception of the Film Society of Calcutta, Aparajito Ray, Apu. Aparajito? Son of Srikumar Rai, right? Yes, his son. He's the grandson of Birendra Kishore Raychaudhuri. And we are sure that he will carry the legacy of his clan forward. What do you think, Shivananda? - Absolutely agreed. I remember your name because it is very unusual. I have never heard of this name before. And I would also heard of that famous height of yours. Then listen to this Mr. Barin, a friend of ours, a family man, Mr. Kamaleshwar Majumdar, has named him Orient Longman. Even he's very interested to make his film. Really? - And we also work together in an advertising agency. Good afternoon, sir. - Afternoon. Apu? Hey, Apu? How long? Almost done. - Okay. We have client meeting at 4:00 PM. Yes. - You will have it. Thank you, brother Munshi. Thank you. Always yesterday deadline. Didn't you leave a little bit more room for logo? Client will create a problem. I can. But that will be an issue for the main illustration. Then we have body copy, baseline, brand name. There will be less space for these. Wow, great! Your calligraphy is improving day by day. Really? It's all poetic knowledge, Mr. Munshi. Really? What record is that? I brought it for you. I went to Free school street last Sunday. I suddenly found this while looking around the vintage record shop. Do listen to it. - Oh, my! This is Wagner's Daipin. German Opera. But I hope you know Wagner was a devout anti-semitic. Anti-semitic. But brother Munshi, do music and politics always... Of course, there's a connection. But you should listen to everything. Mr Rai? - What? DD sir is calling for you. Go. Aparajito? - Yes. There's a very interesting job. From Vignette, I am releasing Bibhuti Mukherjee's 'Pather Padabali's' children edition. - Okay. I named it 'Taalpatar Banshi' (The Palm Flute) Can you quickly make the illustrations? We don't have time. I want to release the book on first of 'Baisakh'. And about the cover, If you could think something along the lines of the siblings running through the Kans Forest. Siblings? I... What? Haven't you read 'Pather Padabali'? May I come in, sir? - I couldn't, brother Dileep. What? The son of Sri Kumar Rai, grandson of Birendra Kishore Raichaudhary, and you haven't heard such an amazing piece of Bengali literature? Strange! Brother Dileep, as you know, cinema and music are my choice of entertainment. And among books I read those detective novels. That too, mainly in English. It's not that I don't read Bengali novels. But I have recently developed a new tendency. Thank you. - Welcome. If I can't find film worthy materials from a book, then I lose interest. Really? Then you must read this book. This can be made into a very good film. Film? Yeah, your film. Although, you don't like anything other than the Hollywood types. Do a thing, quickly read this novel. This is a galley proof. Pass the fire, please. - Is it out? See, the cover, I won't let anyone else design this. People do just the book by its cover. Brother Dileep, I want to say, after reading this book, I have to make the cover in a hurry. Along with home, if I read this in office, alongside work, That's not a problem. In an advertisement agency, such moonlighting is not a crime. And Brown knows the work. The one who knows their work, Brown doesn't meddle with them. For example, your brother Munshi, do you think Brown doesn't know of his day-drinking? If you had any native brown person, it would have been chaos by now. Fine, that solves it. I'll start reading this then. Get started. Brother, move aside. - Okay. Apu, it's quite late. Go to bed. Brother, here's your tea. "TAAL PAATAR BANSHI" (THE PALM LEAF FLUTE) AFTER FEW YEARS Books and books everywhere. Are you reading this book again? How many times will you read it? You know, DD was right. This book can be made into a great film. Will you make Bengali movie? Why? - Don't you remember? You remember you went to a Bengali movie with Uncle Lebu and declared, no more Bengali movies? Oh yes, we didn't get tickets for the Tarzan movie and went to see some random Bengali movie. And in the middle of the movie, Uncle Lebu kept quipping. Bogus. Bogus. But that's quite long ago, Vinku. Though you can't say Bengali movies have changed a lot in the meanwhile. Is that why you're listening to Indian drupadi music rather than Western classical? If I'm to make this film, I've to be familiar with the music. Classical, folk, everything. And DD asked me to be more Bengali. But my weakness for this high-class western music, is hard to overcome. What do you think? - Right. From Sonata in D-minor. Fransesco Maria Veracini. Give me your hand. Live long, dear, live long. You're... deprived of this nectar. Brother Munshi, I'll take your leave. Sure, you may go. But do get some old Western classical records for me. I'll make you a list. From where? Why? From abroad. Do you assume I don't know anything? Oh, you are talking about trip to London? That's still in infancy. No Mr. Ray, you can start planning. I know it all, dear. Five months of training, and one month Europe tour. Although whether you will train them or be trained is to be seen. That's a question. Mr. Brown hasn't confirmed it yet. But yes, if I get the chance, I'll enjoy a lot of European movies in those few months. This I have decided. Cinema fever has you in its grips. - Sorry for the interruption. Please come. - No, I'm leaving. It's evening for me too. Do you need a lift? - That would be good. Okay, come. - I'll leave, brother Munshi. Sure. Brown will give the official notice in two or three days. Let's see. So you'll be soon selling to the first city of the British Empire. From the second? Hey, Mr. Dutta? - Hello. Hello, how are you? - Good. Greetings. Greetings. Didn't I tell you, you'll go a long way? I thought you meant it metaphorically. Hey... Yes, sir. He's here, sir. Mr. Ray, you may go in now. Thank you. Did you ask for me, Mr. Brown? Yes, yes, I certainly did. Come in, Aparajito, be seated. Thank you, sir. So, when is the treat, Mr. Ray? Treat, sir? Yes, of course. This calls for nothing less than dinner and drinks on your behest. The head office has given the final nod. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Did you get your passport done? - Yes, I did. Excellent, now submit your passport to Mr. Kutty, for your Visa and other paraphernalia. Let's raise a toast to your London visit. At the club, this Friday, shall we? Sure, sir. Yes, of course... Good evening, sir. - I've asked in the office to look for accommodation near the Grand Central. Probably easier, if you commute that way. Thank you, Sir. Sir, this is your... - Thank you. Fresh lime soda, salted. You can't be a teetotaller in advertising, that's nothing short of sacrimony. Sir, ice? Yes, please. Just one. Did you submit your VISA and papers? I'll submit them next week. Thank you. - Welcome, sir. It's your trip, Aparajas. Oh, to be in London! Cheers. - Cheers. What's all this? What are these papers? You need visa to go abroad. Who knows, man? You just got married. And then you're going abroad for five or six months? And she would sit here, sad and dejected. I don't like this. Mother, don't you want me to go to London? When did I say that? Can't you ask your boss that you want to take her along? Is it so easy? Do you know how costly it is to go abroad? And then staying there for five or six months? And the food? Would you have a place to live? Vimala can stay there too. Didn't you say you'll have a higher salary there? Just ask your higher officers that only Vimala's travelling costs would need to be incurred by them. Okay, I'll ask DD once. But when I'll be making the film, I'll make you the production manager. Prahlad? This is from stone ages, my first coat. Hand me down. That means, my uber-companion Tweed Jacket, and that cardigan sweater. All the others are tight. I'm thinking from Arlington, I'll make a blazer. - Hold on. I've asked uncle Basu to manage something. Would you also need an overcoat? Even if not now, I'll need in two or three months. During winters. - We can see then. You don't need to buy it right away. What was mom telling you then? To take me to London? Oh, you heard it? Mom's scared, I believe. Her son is handsome, if any foreigner traps him abroad... Really? Is mother scared or her daughter-in-law? Oh, please! - Oh, please! Thanks a lot for giving me this backhanded compliment. You do deserve a gift for that. - What? I'm thinking the matter of taking you with me, I'll put it up to DD. There's a possibility he might talk with Mr. Brown and make it reality. What? I'm obliged. Brown Sir sent it for you. - Oh, thank you. There he is. Mr. Aparajito, I was looking for you. The proposal you gave for taking Vimala on a second honeymoon, head-office has approved that. Really? - Yes. Great. - Confirmed. Company will bear all the costs of transportation, accommodation and everything. Thank you, brother Dileep. How do I... Don't belittle me by thanking me. So I'll inform it to Vimala and mother. Right away. It took us a total of 16 days to reach London. Good morning. Good morning. - Taxi? Thank you. 'I joined work as soon as I reached there.' Hello. - Morning. Good morning. Hello. Good morning. - Good morning. 'Our training was held in Primordial London Office Conference Room.' Yeah, absolutely. 'First day, after going through the introductions,' 'we started studying.' - Please be seated. But brother Munshi's words came true. There wasn't a lot of new new stuff to learn. 'Kinda like learning the alphabet after learning sentence structure.' 'The things I was doing for the last few years,' 'they were just revising that.' This is in-part. 'Naturally, I was losing patience.' 'What's that? It's a body part.' 'So I used my time in other things.' 'This, what catches the attention of...' I first saw a Television in London. I also learned how to write the script for TV commercials. Hello. Oh, there was another important thing I learned. Story-board. Let's play and say it. Hello biscuits. 'Later, that helped me a lot to make films.' 'In fact, during 'Pather Padabali',' 'I used to make story-boards rather than short description.' 'And I would just write the dialogues.' 'Sometimes, I would directly' 'underline the words in the book with red ink.' 'Would be artist.' Me and Vimala used to travel a lot in London. And we enjoyed a lot of films. We had seen 99 firms in those six months. Look at that, Orion theatre. What's running? - Sunset Boulevard. Oh, Billy Wilder? - Yes. But there's a day I'll never forget. The day our landlord and his wife took us to the film 'The bicycle rider'. Okay. - I know. Oh, really? This way, sir. This row. - Here? Yeah, first row... - Thank you. We'll get the row... - Yeah, I think... I'll take it. - One second. Yeah. Come. Yeah. - There will be some time. I guess. Come, the film is about to begin. Excited, right? - A little. Does it have subtitles? I hope so. While seeing the movie, I felt, I was watching the right film at the right time. After the movie, we went to Hyde Park for a walk. There I told my companions the things I want to do for my film, Rossi did exactly that for his movie. And he succeeded. The matter was so realistic. This style is called neo-realism. Thus, six months passed. We climbed the ship to come back to India. I had decided I would draft the script of 'Pather Padabali' on the film. What are you busy doing? Oh, wow! You would draw the entire movie like comic script. This is called story-board. To make TV advertisements, this helps a lot. So your London training is coming to use? Yes, but the way I learned to sketch with minimal strokes from the teachers at Kala Niketan, that's proving to be quite handy too. And then you were Mr. Khirat's favourite student. I am reminded of someone else. - Who? Our Tollygunge government school's drawing sir. Mr. Bishu, he's the one who taught me to draw. Once he saw something I draw and got really happy and said, you are indomitable both in your name and your work. Do you plan to spend the whole day in this locked room with your sketches? See, the original text is so detailed, I don't think a script is very necessary. But still, I've underlined a few places, and then I have my notes. First, I am drafting the story with this, and then I will write the dialogues. - Fine, that'll be done. Come, let's go out, see the sunset, it's so peaceful. Go ahead, I'll be there. "In this sky," "the stars stayed hidden..." "The things I had to say," "are now done!" "In this sky," "the stars stayed hidden..." "Maybe listening, you never did." "And goodbye, you easily bid." Why did you stop the song? See, how dramatic the sky is. Yeah, but the dramatic scenes in my film, one of them is Manik and Uma going to see the train. The earlier night, they were discussing to see the train, but I am thinking, if it came out of nowhere, it feels forced. It might not, how far is the rail-line from their house? Around... Got it, Vinku. Thank you. Thank you very much. - For what? Great, great! Very impressive, I loved it. But the most important thing for making a film is... What? Camera? That can be arranged. We have Sunil. Sunil is in catering service in our film production. He knows a lot of producers. Wasn't there a producer, Mr. Basu, or something? What was his name... Anyway, can't you get a hold of him? I'd have to check, but you know what? It's not so easy to manage that producer. You'll ruin your shoes running after him. First, we need to make a schedule using the script. And then, make a budget. Then Producer... That's a lot of hassle. So brother Apu, your unit... Have you decided who would be in your main team? Yes, I have. You'll handle the production. - Okay. Chandra, he's the most experienced of us. Chandra, see, matching with the village backdrop, we have to make the set in studio. The difference between real location and set shouldn't be clear. Mr. Director, you have to give me the time what I need. And then see, match the photos of real and fake and see if you can get it. I talked with few of the industry's assistant directors. They have a few conventional ideas and they don't want to step out-of-the-box. Debashish, will you assist me? - Who, me? Yes? - Me as assistant director? What are you saying, brother Apu? Can I do it? You have seen so much of world cinema. You know film sense, film form very well. Don't you want to apply that practically? Don't worry. I hired an experienced industrial assistant to handle the technical side. He can manage the schedule and shot division, Thankfully, I served you chicken sandwich for lunch while I was in Cramer. Else, neither would I have met you, nor would my luck be so good. So the most important thing, who would be the cameraman? The people regularly working in studios as camera men, in this natural light, without professional actors, with no makeup, and these experiments, I don't think they'll agree. I'm telling you, they've very fixed ideas. And they are very much resistant towards something new. And then you are new. They won't value you. Yes, it's very difficult to unlearn what you have been doing for years. I talked with Nitai Ghosh. Nitai? Oh, that... The director of 'Udbaasto' film, he makes good films. Yeah, the same. Yes, I talked with him. He's going away for a shooting. And I was wondering if we could take someone new. - Who? I saw someone as observer in Jack Renoir's Ganges. The name... you were there, you know. - That... Subir? The young guy? New one? Young, very young, much younger than he looks, but very strong sense of aesthetics. Due to office pressure, I couldn't even see Mr. Renoir's shooting. Later this guy told me everything about the shooting in vivid details. He's very sharp. Apu, What are you saying? This is your first film. And you want a new guy for camera? Don't you think new cameraman would be too risky. I thought I'll take him as camera assistant first. I haven't even talked with Sudheer yet. Let's see. Let's see. Hello? - Hello, Subir? This is brother Apu. Yes, brother Apu? I heard you're making a film. So you heard the news? Yes, absolutely. I even know a little bit about the people in your team. But you could have thought about me as well. As an assistant cameraman or something. I can't take you on as assistant cameraman as I have already hired someone else. He's quite competent. Can I at least get the permission to see the shooting? As a camera apprentice. No, I don't need apprentice or anything. Just directly come for the shooting as a cameraman. Are you joking? - Absolutely not. You are this film's lead cameraman. Of course, only if you agree. What? I have never even touched a film camera. You take still pictures, don't you? And you take great pictures. And compared to the professional camera-man here, your composition, sense of light aesthetics are amazing. The basics are the same, optics. See, brother Apu, I'm a still photographer. The technical side... I mean, there's a huge difference between still camera and a movie camera. I'll give you an experienced assistant to help you with all the technicalities. And the only difference between a still camera and a movie camera is that in the movie came, the film moves. This is a huge camera. Can we take it outside? Yes, you can. All we would need are two extra attendant. Subir, won't a wall camera be better? No, what are you saying? This is good. Who gives permissions to outsiders to enter the shooting premises? So I've been seeing these people in the studio premises for the last few days. What is their intention? They're making a revolutionary film. And that neither has hero, heroine nor love or romance. Mad men! Hey Sanjay? Isn't that Sunil? Who? - The one in grey Panjabi and Dhoti. He has worked in the production for few days with Bhupi. Yes, right. And who is that tall banyan tree? So damn tall. Is he a new hero? - Oh, no. He's their leader, the director. Director? I haven't seen him before. Whose assistant? - None's. He hasn't assisted anyone. A Foreigner came to make a movie. He went around with him for a while. He's Shrikumar Ray's son. Shrikumar Ray? From the silent era? - No man. The one who wrote that weird poem book. So he could write poems why make bioscope? No experience and all... - To hell with your experience. That fat man behind the camera. He's never held a camera in his life. Just think of the daring. Not daring, stupidity. Hey, Sunanda's coming here. Move, move. - Greetings. Greetings, madam, - Greetings, sister. Brother Apu, Sunanda sister, big heroine. Madam's here. Open the lock. Action! - This tree is blocking the light. That side. Greetings. Good morning, madam. See, Ms. Sunanda came, we wished good morning, then greeted her. And they didn't even pay attention. Oh please, they value themselves too high. Stupid! - Let's go. It's all fine. Ajit Sen said he has a Solo wall camera. He won't even take much, you can test it. As you can understand, we don't have much. Sunil, you've to make the final budget now. Yes, brother. That's fine, but first take writer's wife's permission. See if she has any demands? Yeah, I'm supposed to go to Rama Devi tomorrow, I talked with her on call. Let's see. - Okay. See, I don't have the money to pay you at the moment. If the producer gives me the money, I can do so. If till then... See dear many people have talked with me. There was someone just yesterday. If I say yes, they will send the money. What was the name? - Premanshu Sanyal. The other producer, Mr. Ganguly. Mr Ganguly? - Yes. Alpana Movie? - Yes. What? I told him the story and he is doing it on his own? Dangerous, strange! He said, he'll get Dev Kamal Basu for the film. See, we have went quite ahead with the story. We have worked a lot on this as well. We have been working on this movie for a long time. We are totally ready. - Don't worry, dear. You are Mr. Srikumar's son. My husband used to revere him a lot. I have seen the cover of 'Taalpatar Banshi' you drew. Quite amazing! The money's not everything, dear. I want this novel to be turned into a good film. And I believe you can do that. Ask our lawyer, Mr. Shashidhar, to make an agreement. I'll give the rights to him. You can pay me as per your convenience. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. That's all fine, but, do you have a producer? Yes, we're talking. It will be done. There's nothing to worry. We even take restoration projects sometimes. Please come. See, we have been doing distribution since the era of silent movies. We've recently done four, five movies. We have a rich history. And all these film equipments you see, quite old. And this camera? Even I don't know how old this is? We don't just do films for profit. We do come from various subjects like society, patriotic, revolutionary, and then the biographies of various people. Mr. Bibhuti's Pather Padabali is a very great novel, I have to agree, but, the way you want to make the film, well, it is our business. We can't take this all the time. But I can tell you this, if you can somehow gather the money to make the movie, distribution will be my responsibility Thanks a lot, Mr. Amiya. It's all fine, but can't the movie have some romance, some fun? Wouldn't it have been better if it had that? I hope you understand? - Yes, it does. Take this scene, for example. Srinivas, the sweet-seller, is asking Uma, if she wants sweets? But Uma said no because she knows they don't have that money. And then, chasing Srinivas, while running around the pond they are finding their happiness. Where are the tea and sweets? Please go ahead. - Next, Manik and Uma are running through the Kans forest. To see a train for the first time in their lives. Uma tumbled down, but Manik kept running. The train's coming closer running through the Kans forest and white clouds, billowing steam all around... - And the steaming tea is here. Did you go to Darjeeling for getting the tea? Seriously? Sweets please? - No. This is the local Bheem Nag's Sandesh, try this. No, I'm not so fond of sweets. What? Do you already have sugar at this age? No, no, please have sweets. Me? I'm diabetic. Such a vile disease. I better go to the toilet once. Don't worry, daughter-in-law told me, famous writer's famous story. But, at least have some two, three songs. This is bioscope, right? Okay, I'll be back. What? All the money's gone? Okay, do a thing. Take stuff worth 1,00,000 rupees. Okay? This is a tragedy. No. No hero, heroine, so? Without romance, what'll audience see? And why would they come to the hall? Do a thing. Write something fresh and come over. Social drama or love story, something like 'Jeebon Jigyasa'. The film has to be emotional. But modern. New! Keep this. Yes. She's a new heroine. Give her a good role. But a major part. Apu? What's this? My insurance policy. This would get me some 7000 rupees. What? And these? Are you going to sell these too? It would hurt me a little bit to sell these. I'll buy them back in installment with my salary. And what would these books and records fetch you? No what I am trying to do is shoot a small part, show that and then gather some money. That won't do Apu, wait. Here. If you mortgage these, you can at least start the movie. This is your wedding jewellery. What about mom? - I'll manage her. And why do we even need to tell her? Once you get a producer, we'll get these out. No Vinku, these... - Apu. Just listen to me. I'm taking this chair. There's Debashish. So brother Apu, is Kamaldighi place done? - Hey, brother Ravi? One more round. - No, no, completely. Yes, sure. - Brother Apu, that place Kamaldighi, should be named a swamp not a place. A muddy swamp named Kamaldighi. Everywhere you see you have knee level water, see my condition. And how would you have a Lotus without mud? That's Mr. Bibhuti's village. The book refers to that at Shantapur. No, we can't shoot there. Tripod and mud is not a good combo. Brother Apu, I invited a friend of mine a month ago. The village was named Saral. A nice and serene village, ideal country-side. This matches your story-board, you can check that out. Sure, but how far is it? Not too far, might be four, five miles from Kolkata. Then, it's quite close. And I've a friend there, Manoj, quite an efficient man. They have ancestral land there, it won't be a problem, let's check it out. Good. - Come, let's check it out. I can't do it in weekdays, let's check out your ideal country-side next Sunday. It is full of Kans trees, just like this. All right, great. Yes, this one. There we are. - Wow! Amazing, such an awesome place! - Yeah, sure. Perfect! The Kans forest cover such a lot of area. What is this? - You haven't seen this? One mm movie camera. My friend, Cloth Renoir gifted me this. Oh, Renoir sir's nephew? - Yes. He's here to shoot Hari Sahab's documentary. Here? - Yeah, in Kolkata. So he rented me for one day. Even the rail-line's pretty close. - Just here. Wow, perfect! Such a beautiful place so close to home? Yeah, brother. - Amazing Debu, very good. Just 40 minutes from Tollygunge. And Mr. Sunil would be happy with low costs. You know when I was a kid, Rabindranath signed my autograph book, and wrote a few lines of poetry. I couldn't realize the meaning now, but now I am reminded of these lines here. I know the poem you're talking about. "For a long while, a distance of miles, I spend a lot, spending nations around..." "The mountain range I saw, I saw oceans blue..." "The thing I couldn't see, home, a few steps along," "a drop of dew resting atop a grain of wheat." Vinku? - Yes? The ad I gave for the guy, that's published. Hey? - O mister? "Check the Qutub Minar of Delhi," "the miracles of the city Bombay..." - Hey Apu? Come here, once. - What? Just come. Come. The Manik you're looking all over, he's playing here. What do you think? There, that guy. See. - That one? No, I can't, show me once. Hey? Hey boy? Who, me? Not you, the one next to you, in check-shirt? Hey, he's calling for you. You. Yes, you. What's your name? - Prabir, Prabir Banerjee. Prabir? Would you come upstairs once? That's the stairs. "Check the miracles of city Bombay." - Come, come... "For your money..." Hey, Debashish? - Yes? Can you speak dialogues? I surely can. - Yeah. Such huge parts had to be said in a breath. Okay, can I hear one, two lines? No, I don't remember anything as such. That was so long back. Theatres, plays, I have also done few bioscopes. Historical, Social, would you listen to a poem? Fine, sure. "O my aunts dear, come to house mine." "Not a bed, or Diwan either." So dear, how much would you pay me? How much do you want? I'll take 20 rupees daily. Okay, fine, that'll be done. She needs a little opium daily. Actually, at the end of the day, without that, and a little milk. Okay, that'll be done, don't worry. Okay, okay. Okay, fine. What are you writing? We had few letters wishing new year, just replied to those. How did it go? - You won't believe it, Vinku. She's just right, perfect in fact. She fits the role to a T, as if she's one Mr. Bibhuti wrote about. That's great news, Apu. I thought it would be very difficult to get someone like that. But I must say, you are very lucky, Apu. The luck is surely a factor. But we have looked everywhere. And then we found this precious gem. Got it? - Yes. And this precious gem can act naturally? It does seem so, she seemed like a true professional. Who said they won't work with professional actors? I was talking about big stars. Their acting style is full of mannerisms. First the sing-song delivery, and they can't work without full makeup. They won't listen either. I can't afford them. I will hire some character actors, who are very talented. And the rest have to be amateurs, like, Rossi did in 'the bicycle rider'. And did you find someone like that? The character of 'Sarvamangala' is very important. My friend, Sambid Bandopadhyaya, his wife will do that. An active member of communist party. I have seen her act in Picos theatre, very powerful actress. Has she done cinema before? Leftists, they are a bit snobby, Vinku. They consider Bengali commercial film to be low-grade. They don't consider cinema as a valid art format. I will take that girl. Open the door, I'll just change. Sing that song, dear, "Chaander Hasir Baandh Bhenge." No need, I don't need songs for my film. She can dance too, dance. "Aye Tori Sahchari", what you did at home. Listen, I don't need dance either, I have seen what I had to. See, she doesn't match what I am looking for. She's a bit too city-like for this movie. If needed, I'll tell you later. Okay? And immense thanks for taking the pains to find my house. Will you have tea? - Apu? One minute, let me... - What will you do? Will you come inside with me? Vinku? - You too, just a minute. Come. This side. Come. Look at her. Does she look like your Uma? Absolutely. Keep some loose change with you. Today, is the first day of the shoot. It would have been great if you also came. - Even I wanted to go. But I have to take Mother to the doctor today positively. Take blessings by bowing down to Father's picture and go meet Mother once. - Okay. You all be seated. I'll be back soon. - Sure. So, everyone ready? - Absolutely. Ready for war. - Great. It would be great. All the best. - Thank you. It's been so long you haven't cooked anything for us. Say something, Subir. Yes, especially that 'luchi' and mutton curry Yes. - You all win the war and come back. Then you can have it tonight only. Prahlad, they will be having dinner with us tonight. Okay. Let's go. - Yes, let's go. Brother Apu, here. All the best. Thank you. - Thank you. Be careful. We anyhow found the Kans Grass forest and the railway track beside it. But, when I went there to shoot, I saw... the fields were empty. There wasn't a single Kans Grass there. We got completely shattered. Someone cut it all off? No, apparently the cows grazed it. Of course, we shot a small sequence there. And for the rest of it, we had to shoot it the next year. Cut, cut, cut. What did I tell you, Prabir? When you'll come here, come while looking around. Why would you keep looking around? You are searching for your Sister. Aren't you? Understood? - Yes. Let's start again quickly. Going for another take. Okay. Let's go. One more time. -Yes, let's go. Prabir ready? Roll sound. -Rolling sir. Roll camera. Rolling. 'Pather Padavali'. Scene 42/2. Take 14. And action. No, no. Cut, cut, cut. How would it happen? He is marching like the military. No. It won't happen this way. We have to plan it differently. Okay, Prabir? - Check the sound. You go and take some rest. Is anyone there? Please give some water. Hey, give him some water. You all please come this side. -Yes. Only you come. - Yes. Give me the spinning top. How many people do we have? Five people. - Five people? What? Okay? Come, let's check again. We'll go again. Camera? - Rolling. And action! Manik? - Manik. Prabir? Prabir? - Prabir? Got it. Excellent. Very good. Very good. Everyone has done very good. - Very good. Very good. You can do it, dear. Slowly, slowly.. Go there, go there. I'll change the reading. Brother Apu, please check if the position of Uma is alright. Subir, make Devi sit in such a way, that the distance is maintained. So that she could cover his mouth with her hands. Check once if you can cover your Brother's mouth with your hand properly. - Prabhir! You have to make sure that the sugarcane is pointed... Where is the sugarcane? Who will take care of the continuity? - Where is the sugarcane? Do I have to check everything? Get me the sugarcane. Take this. - Okay. Show me how will you have the sugarcane? Hold it like a flute. - Yeah, yeah. Not like that. Give it to me. Hold it like this. Hold it like a flute. Okay? Like this. Okay? Hold it. Devi, do you remember the dialogues? - Yes. Deliver them once. - You start it. Say it. - Where did we come, dear? Just eat it. - What are those? Say it properly. Point at them and ask what are those? What are those, dear. - Say it loudly. What are those? What are those? Repeat after me. What are those, dear? - Very good. Then? If Mother gets to know about it... Okay Devi. This is the time when you would hear the noise. Okay? You'll cover his mouth in between when he would be speaking. You'll try to hear it and figure out where is the noise coming from. Okay? You'll stand up. And once Sister stands up, what will you do, Prabir? I'll also stand up. - Very good. You'll also stand up. Okay? Then paying your complete attention, you'll try to figure out the noise of the train. That where is it coming from? Keep looking around. - Keep looking around. Very good. Let's go for a rehearsal. Let's go for a rehearsal. - Yes, let's go. Let's go for a rehearsal. - Sure. It has to be okay in one single take. Okay? We have some time. Do the rehearsal nicely. Yes. - Yes. Should I give it? Should I give you a blanket? - Brother Apu? This... Will this entire film be wasted on one shot? So much action, dialogues, and the train... Can you do it in one take? If it doesn't work, if it becomes NG, then another tape. Another hour. No Subir, you are right... What can we do? How long for the train? Still 45 minutes. 45 minutes? Hey Debashish, please bring the script once. Hey. - Shut up. Quick, quick! Please hold. - Give it to me. And focus from here... - Hey Subir? Yes. I don't know, what will happen after two days? What if we break it up into two shots? Yes? - Suppose, first shot is cut when they stand. Okay. And for the second shot, we raise the camera to a height. Yes. They enter on a blank frame, from below the camera. And then we show the shot of the train, they can see here and there on the frame then frame out, won't it be easier? And it will mitigate the risk too. Good idea. Then let's start? - Yes. Brother Jadav, let's go. Come, let's go. - Yes, we are ready. Come. Order. Yeah... Roll sound. - Rolling. Roll camera. - Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 43/1, take one. And action. Where are we? Just eat. What's that? If mother learns of it, she'll... Cut it. Such amazing scene. And it's impact, this train scene will be an iconic scene. See, honestly, we didn't have any experience of shooting before this. We didn't have a concrete idea of the technicalities and the nitty-grity of cinema. For example, the scene where Manik sees the train and runs towards it. If you notice it carefully, you'll see, the train, billowing steam is coming from the right side of the frame. And the camera's behind Manik. Back to the camera. - Is this sir? Softly... - So I couldn't see Manik's reaction, but I wanted to catch his expression. So I took the camera to the opposite end. And then, the train, comes from left on the foreground, instead of right. This was a huge error in the grammar of film. See, in the film definition, there's a concept of 180 imaginary line. Suppose, we are sitting here, and the camera's here, you are on right of camera, and I'm on left. If I take the camera to the opposite end, our sitting position changes. You go to the left, and I on right. And if you use those shots consecutively in editing, it creates a jerk, audience will get a shock. This is an error. But later, some film critics, specially abroad, started saying, the impact created due to breaking this rule, is amazing, incredible! But this wasn't intentional, rather due to our lack of knowledge. We did it by mistake. It was a hassle to educate Apu. He learned to draw in Kala Niketan. Why? To rot away in a bioscope? Is Apu the type of man to rot away? He's very talented and innovative. Else, such a movie, has anyone ever taken their own picture? You tell me, how much does Apu earn? Around 75 rupees. - Then? Is this a meagre amount in this time? That's why I am shouting. Leaving behind such a great job.... Surma, you are not getting it. When Apu entered the work force, he started at 35 rupees. And that has increased to 75 rupees in these few days. Can you imagine that? You see, he'll gain international fame with this cinema. The shooting went on for few days, then? What then? Looking for money? But a generous man, whose name I won't take, agreed to produce. - Wow! Why not take the name? See, that producer used to roll money from one movie to another. As luck would have it, one of that producer's film was a massive flop. Then? What else? Producer went missing. Shooting stopped, no money. The shooting was stopped for a whole year. Nave. - Nave? You mean, naive? Naive. That's naive, this is nave. N-A-V-E. - That's... That's K-N-A-V-E. Why would it be K-N-A-V-E? This is N-A-V-E, nave. That's not a word, Vinku. Who said so? I read it in convent. N-A-V-E means... - No. Just because you studied in convent, doesn't mean you would know better English. Why are you talking like this? That's not what I mean. There's something called N-A-V-E, it's something to do with the church, I studied in convent. Wait, let me check the dictionary. Just criticism.. Where's the Oxford one? - I don't know. N-A-V-E, nave. Here, nave is the long central part of a church where most of the seatings are. I told you. - Okay, you know everything, okay. Why are you reacting like this, Apu? What happened? You are so high strung lately. As you like board games, I thought Scrabble might relax you a bit. It's just a game, Apu. I can realize that.... - No, you don't realize anything. Vinku, nothing. The shooting has been stopped for so long. Aunt Sheila has put her money here. And so did Kiran. I have no idea how I'll pay them back. And the worse thing is I have no idea whether I'll even be able to resume shooting. We even had to mortgage your jewellery. Did I ever say a word about jewellery? You'll get it out once you have money. I haven't been able to shoot even a day in the last year. And with Nonibala Devi's age, God forbid, if something happens now, all the efforts will come to a naught. Nothing will come to a naught. There was a white owl outside this window that day. That's a good omen. Vinku, I'm not amused, it's a cruel joke. It's not a joke. Don't get so depressed and don't lose hope. Aunt Sheila said, they know Bimaan Roy quite well. Maybe we can talk to him and come to a solution. Who? Bimaan Roy? Chief minister? - Yes. Have you lost it? - Why? He is worried about our entire state. And you expect him to drop everything and tell us how to resume 'Pather Padabali'? And I have heard he's a very strict person. He doesn't value art, most probably he doesn't understand it. Don't talk rubbish, Apu. It is true that he is a little cut and dry type of person, but that doesn't mean he doesn't understand anything. He's a very learned man. I'm sure he will appreciate it. And even he is a Bengali like us. So he might just.... - You have weird ideas, Vinku. Aunt Sheila's daughter, Archita, is my school junior. She'll take you there, just see how it goes. Please. Sarvamanagla informed Harimadhav of Uma's death. I want to make this scene quite impactful. Yes, go ahead. Carry on, I am listening. And then Sarvamangala told their neighbours, they're leaving the village. Because there's no scope of livelihood here. And if they stay here, they won't be able to recover from the shock of Uma's death. The neighbours did express sorrow, but they didn't agree with them. The village elders came to Harimadhav's house, to try to stop Hari from leaving his ancestral house. But he, Harimadhav, I mean, had decided that he'll go to Kashi by then. The packing's done, the kitchen's wrapped up. He couldn't even offer the guests tea and smoke. Harimadhav... - Oh, my... I asked you for tea, but forgot to order it. Please. - I'll take care of it, Sir. We can have the tea later, Uncle Viman. Rather, you listen to the end of the story. It's just a little bit more. Send four cups of tea in a pot, sugar and milk separately. Sorry, go ahead. Harimadhav had decided that he'll go to Banaras to earn a living. Why Banaras? What's wrong with Kolkata? No, that's famous for the priestly works. Okay, okay, go on. Harimadhav had decided that he'll go to Banaras to earn a living. He didn't even have the money to repair his house. He decided to sell whatever he had to pay back the debt. And the last scene, where we'll show Harimadhav and his family are leaving Shantipur village in a bullock-cart. Sarvamangala's eyes were teary, Their house is in a dilapidated state. A snake enters the house. And then? Then End. What? Why would Harimadhav leave the village? There are so many community development projects in the villages. No, that can't be. Change the ending. Harimadhav, with the other villagers, took a loan from the government to run a tractor. Yes, he can't go to Kashi. Then, the movie will end on a happy note, there will be hope. Audience will leave the hall on a happy note. Yes, change it. - Yes, very good idea. No, Will such a drastic change be possible? And this is based on the very famous novel by Bibhuti Mukherjee. Almost all of us know the ending. In this case, without the writer's consent, how can we suddenly... Request Mr Bibhuti to change the ending, take my name. Else I won't be able to take the money out from community funds. No, that's a bit difficult. Why difficult? He left. So tell him when he returns. When is he coming back? He's not in this world anymore. Oh, sorry! See... I forgot about the death of such a renowned writer. Very sorry. Keep the tea there, we'll take this. Then what can we do here? What can we do in this case? I.. I... There's no way other than the community funds. What can I do here? Can I suggest something, sir? - Yes. The name of the story is Pather... - Pather Padabali. Ballad of the road. - Yes, yes. So I was thinking, from road department, I mean PWD, if we release a fund? Excellent! Do a thing, give them the fund reserved for making highway in Siliguri. I'll arrange something for the land in the next quarter. Menon will pay you something, use that to start. What did you say was your name, Aparajito? The name is quite unique... Go with him, he will explain the formalities. Okay? First, you'll get an advance, and then after your account for it, the next part, so you will get the money in installments. Go with him, take them. Thank you so much. - That's fine. Thank you, uncle Vimaan. Apu's a very talented boy. You see, he'll never disappoint you. I know that. Hey, please have the tea. Sit. Please give them the tea. - Yes, sir. Aparajito? Who is it? What is happening here? Where is this light coming from? This has fallen down. - Okay silence. What are you even shooting, Debashish? Tank will be over. - He's conscious. What's happening here? - Okay, fine, sit. Pather Padabali, scene 43/1. Take One, action. Hey, this wasn't part of the script. Why are you shooting without informing me? This wasn't there. "Spend a lot, roaming nations across.." "Mountains I went to see, went to see oceans blue." "Just couldn't see my home..." Stop the shooting. Can you hear me? Who? Apu? Apu, it's me, Vinku. Who? Vinku? Come. Where? Where are you going, Vinku? Vinku! See there. Is this the owl you were talking... Vinku? Fire. Hey, Apu? - Apu. What are you mumbling? Huh? What happened? No, nothing. Just a nightmare. No more. It seems your advance cheque is here. What? Let me see. Correct. Let me give my clients this good news. Hey. - What? There's another news. What? A new family member is coming to our house. Most probably, he got your work done. What? Finally, the lady luck was happy on me. How? I realize that if I only shoot on Sundays and holidays, it'd be years before this shooting is over. So, either I have to leave the job, or I had to apply for a long leave. I had a new boss by then, Mr.Newman. Whether he'll be generous towards me, like Mr. Brown, I had no idea. I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Newman. I shall always be obliged to you for this. You're welcome, Mr. Ray. And I wish you all the best in your venture. You've got a great story to tell. And I hope you remember to come back to us when your shooting is done. Certainly, sir. Thank you once again. - You're welcome. Hey Apu? What happened? Done. - Congratulations. He's even a step ahead of Mr. Brown. I really couldn't imagine, that he'd give me such a long, extended leave. And that too, leave with pay. This is a gift in disguise. Yeah, so kind of him... - Nothing kind as such. They don't want to lose an asset like you. By the way, I don't want to lose my cover designer. Keep that in mind, later you'll be the film director and.. A lot could have happened in this year. With Manik's age, his voice could have broken. And with Nonibala Devi's age and physical condition, anyday, she could have... - Please keep your head down. Please keep your head down. Between your knees, okay? - Yes. Here, look at me. Bend now, bend. Bend completely, completely. This is not a problem, right? No. - Fine. Subir? - Yes? Let's go, let's go to the ground. - One minute. Come. - Wait. Going for take. - Okay, yes. Yes, blanket. Hey! First position, please. Brother, is it fine? - Yes, fine. Yeah, yeah, fine. That's enough. - This is first one. Order please. Roll sound. - Rolling. Roll camera. - Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 70, take one. - And action. Cut it. - Okay. Okay. Good, quite good. Aunt? Hey Aunt? Hey Aunt? Aunt? Aunt? I was saying, - "O sister, you..." what about payment? - "Give me salvation." Hey, Debashish? - "O sister..." Keep a note of this song... "Give me salvation..." - I can incorporate it later. "O mine...." - Keep this horizontally. The head should be there. Listen, I was wondering, let's talk with Subir, and keep the camera at an elevated level. Then... - Don't I need to get on the pyre? Why did you come? No, no, I was saying, I'm using the dummy for this shot. You don't need to. Please sit. - No, no You don't need all that dummy. Put me on the pyre. Who can experience such a thing alive? I'm not losing this chance. Can you do it? Of course. - You need to keep your eyes closed. And stop your breath as well. Can you do it? Just check if I can. I'll anyway be on the pire in a few days. This might be a rehearsal. Okay, fine, let's go. Debashish? - Yes. But that one year had helped me in a different way. How so? Growing up in a city, the rural lifestyle, and the customs were something I had no idea about. But in this one year, for making Chandra Seth, I had to go to the Saral village a lot of times. Thus, the real character of rural Bangla, and their mannerisms, lifestyle, and a million other things, I was enriched by that. And their excitement was palpable. Brother Apu, so we are starting 21/B, right? So Debashish, I had an idea. Yes? I need a bald head. Bald head? - Yes, bald head. See, I wanted, in the starting of the rainy scene, the first drop would fall on the bald head of a man, who was catching fish by the pond. How would that be? Good idea. Should I call Sunil? - Yeah, yeah. Sunil? - Hey Sunil? Come here, please. - Yeah, brother Apu. I want a bald man. Bald? - Bald man, bald. Okay, let me see. Brother, please come here once. Do you have any bald-headed man in your village? Of course, is there any dearth of bald men? Wow, can you call someone like that? Of course, he's right here. Hey Kartik? Here, will he do? Yeah. I saw a bald man, of your village, and he was perfect. Do you know the name? Name? I don't know the name. Then, how would I look for him? Right. How would you know? Listen, give me a paper and pen. Do it on the blank page. Here. No. no. See. This is Haru, the washer-man. Yes, yes. Haru, the washer-man - That does it, call him. Do you know him? - Yes. Please call him then. - Call him. Go and call Haru, the washer-man. - Such a perfect drawing. Wow, just amazing. Bald, What bald head? Tak Duma Dum Dum. Brother Apu, come, let's go. - Let's go. Okay? - One second. It should be on the centre. Here, right? Here. Come, let's go? Roll camera? - Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 54/1, take 4. - Action. Cut, cut, cut. Debashish, just one drop and exactly at that point. Okay. - In the centre. Once more, I'm doing it once more. Is it ready? - Give it to me. Yes. Please keep the head down, okay? I'm out of frame, right? Yes, raise your hand a little. - Okay? Yea, fine. - Fine, right? Come. - Roll camera. Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 54/1, take five. Going. The first drop of rain, starting from that dramatic scene, to the huge rain scene, which you created, I am very interested to know the story of its building. I heard, this was the first time in world, and most probably just once, the actual rain was used in an actual rain scene. See, I can't talk of the whole world, but I can assure you, in our nation, before this movie, outdoor shooting was not so prevalent. And rain was a main subject of our film. And that has to happen outdoor. So, no choice but to wait for rain. Yes, like the Jacobin cuckoo, we waited for rains for two days. There's no sign of rains. And the wait had tired my unit too. But the day the rains came, due to an important office work, I couldn't do the shooting. Subir, Chandra and the others did the shooting that day. Debashish? - Yes? Come here once. Subir? - Yes? Subir? Yes? - Come here. See, Apu wanted a frame like this. I mean... - Yeah, got it. But will the centre compass look good in whiteshot? Wouldn't it be better if it were a little off center? But this is exactly what he scribbled. Else when the girl's hair swings, it will go out of frame. When she'll be staring at the sky, we should take a closer. Hey, you are sitting here and there... Come, come, it will rain, brother Janak, quick! Yeah, yeah, go there, call him. You can't trust rains. Hold this. - Take this. Quickly, put it back. What happened? Hey, hey, hold that. - Hold it on outside. Come, come. Take it there, there. Yeah, yeah... take it to the front. Hey, brother, where are you going? Come, come. Be quick. Listen, run there, and come here. Okay, okay. Camera rolling? Right, to the right. Turn around, turn around? Yes. Yeah, fine, that's fine. Feeling cold? - What? Feeling cold? Shawl, shawl... Give her the umbrella. Yeah, do it like this, yes. - Yes, yes. Softly, softly, don't fall. Softly, yes. Yeah, cover him. Hold your brother, hold him. Hold your brother. And then... Subir? - Yeah. Got it? - Yeah, I'm almost there, almost... "Rain, rain, go away.. Come again, another day..." "Rain, rain, go away... Come again, another day.." "Rain, rain, go away... Come again, another day.." "Rain, rain, go away... Come again, another day.." This is a very interesting story. So, we know, that shooting is another name of austerity. But, there are a lot of interesting incidents there. And we, the outsiders, never know of that. If you're reminded of any such incident? There are many such incidents. For example, Srinivas, the sweet-seller, Seeing the water reflection scene, a gentleman thought, it was printed in reverse by mistake. Behind Srinivas and Uma and Manik, and the dog following them. It was a huge trouble to take this shot. There's the reflection, yes. Is there a telephone nearby? Telephone? In this remote village? Have you lost it? And why? Babushona is not well since morning. Why did you come today? You could have come any other day. I don't want to miss this shooting. But where would you find the telephone now? You might find it in the post office, but that's quite far. Mother is at home. She'll surely handle it. Now let me concentrate on this shot. It has both kids and animal. A dangerous situation, just wait right here. Hey, are you done? - Replay it. Debashish? The dog's waiting. Debashish, can you hear me? Here, say it. Debashish, can you hear me? - Yes, brother Apu. The dog's waiting. And he loves you. Get him up. And get them on position. Okay, fine. - Bring them back. Hey, Subir... - Yeah. Brother Apu, one second, I just thought of an interesting thing. Let me do the composition. Tilt down, tilt down. Move, move. Yes. - Yeah, I see the reflection. See, brother Apu. Take the camera to that side. It'll go there. Yeah, the reflection's better there. Are you only trying to get the reflection? Yes. - Good frame, here. Yes, check that. Then let's do this, we'll plan the master differently. Okay? - Yes. Hey, come, let's go. - Careful, careful. Brother Apu, just coming. Yes, careful. Okay, okay? Let's go. - Yeah. Then let's go. There are three locks, open the first one. - Okay, roll sound. One second, let's go. Roll camera. Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 22, take one. And action. Follow him, follow. Come, come. Cut, cut, cut. The dog's not moving, ask him to go. Apu? - Yes? Wait. Hold this, what? Give the girl something in her hand, that'll attract the dog. Food? Yes, right. Hey, listen. Give her some sweets from the sweet pot. Damn! Sweets will cause him to lose his fur. Something plain, biscuits or something. Something... - Man, he'll lose fur. Hey, give it. Do you have some biscuits? Yes. - Give it to Devi. Ask her to show that, so the dog will follow. Okay. - Will the reflection work? Yes, yes. - Then, fine. Mr. Kartik... Come, come, let's go. Should we go? - Should we go? Roll camera. - Rolling. Pather Padabali, scene 22, take 10. Action. And cut it, excellent. Excellent, excellent shot. Great! - Oh, man! Thank God, Sarameya. One shot made me sweat bullets. Thank you. Hey listen, give him some biscuits. He deserves it. And then there was another problem. The duty of waking Manimala Devi at dawn, and escorting her to shooting spot, was given to a Punjabi driver. He didn't have the alarm clock. So he made up a solution himself. What's happening here? Hey brother? Why did you stop the car at Tram line? Are you an idiot? Sorry, a mistake. - A idiot. Forgive me. - What can I even say? He stopped the car at tram line and is snoring away, move it. Quick. - Yeah, I'm leaving. Later, Sajjan Singh came to an understanding with them. He used to keep the car next to tram line. And while passing, they would ring the bell and wake him up. Oh, my door is open. Don't do roaming around in noon. Keep in mind and cook some rice for yourself, and something for Mini. Don't forget it. Wait. Outdoor shooting is somehow finished. After this the biggest challenge for us was... to construct the Manik's house on the set as it is. So, this is the plan. Okay? This is Harimadhav's entire house. And this door is this one in here. And what is the name of that old woman? Nonibala. - Nonibala. Even Nonibala will sit right here. The rest you can figure out. - You have done a good job. We'll get so much space. Yes, it'll be easier for me to place trolleys, lights, etc. as well. The pillars would be made of wood. Right? Yes. Definitely. And I'll make a 'Kalongi' in the house. 'Kalongi?' Hey! - It looks something like this. Where we keep Lord Ganpati. 'Kulungi'? - 'Kulungi' isn't it? Kulungi. I couldn't even figure it out. That the Manik's house was constructed on the set. See, I don't think much people outside the production unit could figure that out. But all the credit goes to our art director, Chandragupta Kichlu. Not only the detailed set construction... in some cases, if it weren't for a few improvisations, this masterpiece would not have been possible. For example, in Saral, the door in the real location, the lower part of the door is broken and withered. As the weathering techniques we have here is not too good. And it wouldn't have been realistic as well. Chandra studied set construction and he innovated... by bringing such an effect, which made it impossible to figure out if that is real or fake. We are left with a doubt. Even after having a house in the real location, why did you have to construct it later on the set to shoot? We don't have the lightings required to shoot night scenes in outdoor locations. On this context, I would like to tell our cameraman Subir He has made some miraculous innovations regarding the lighting systems in that movie. That is literary revolutionary. Not only in our country. I have rarely seen the natural lights of that sort even in foreign movies. He didn't let the light fall directly on the actor. He used to bounce it on them. Just how it happens in real. This camera work of Subir. Changed the World cinema in itself. A little back, a little back. Yes, yes. That is the last. Give me the mark. - Okay, fine. Do you need this light? Should I turn on this light? - We'll rehearse once. About this fan, Brother. - That light... Put it up. - Come on, push the trolley. We'll do it with dialogues. The brick, fast. Keep moving. Come on... Have you ever boarded a train? - Hey, brother Apu? Yes, you give it. Brother Apu, we would need a light in that room. It's looking pretty dark. Keep it there. This is the last position. - That's it. We just need a light in that room right there. Okay. It seems dark in there. - You all take some rest. Hey Jhontu? Hey Jhontu? Why have you kept this light here? Keep it behind the door. Make the light bounce. There is no space here, sir. Oh, no! Is there really no space? Wait, wait, wait. - Yeah, here. Do one thing. The truck that we have. Get a headlight from the truck. Bring the battery too. And keep it inside that pot. Go, go, quick! - I'll just get it. Hey brother, get the light. Okay, sir? Wow, good! Pather Padabali, scene 37, take four. And action. Trolley. You heard the train outside. Tell your sister. Sister? - Yes? Have you seen a train? Yes. - Pure rubbish. Do you know where the train line is? - There. Saral danga ground, then wheat fields, then rail line. Will you go once? - Sure. Mr Bhanu. Show me what you wrote, dear? Wow, quite good. Now write 'Oibhoot'. Oh, God! A demoness came then, "Hau Mau Khau" Who's the human I smell? Who lies awake in my temple? Neelkamal sleeps and Lalkamal lays awake. And then, during noon, the demoness came again. "Hau, Mau, Khau..." Who is the human I smell? Who lies awake in my temple? Give me the news... - Uma? Let's go. Go, go. Mr. Aparajito? I'm very curious about one scene, an unforgettable scene. Harimadhav is returning home after Uma's death. Without knowing anything, Sarvamangala is informing him. The frame... I am thinking it like this. This is the frame. Sarvamangala is standing here, and Harimadhav is sitting here. See, Subir. Do you want topish? - A little topish, 50? Maybe 35. Is Tarpa here? Subir just went to get them, they'll be here. Listen, there was a storm. So the straw on top, I am reducing it a little. Yes, just a little, don't make it a cyclone. And the props to be kept inside Harimadhav's bag, are they ready? Yes, everything is checked. That's like Chandragupta Kichlu. Debashish, get the artist ready with their lines. Magazine? - Up, up. Get up, get on the roof. Yes. - Put him there. Here, here. - Okay. If you put it up, I'll put Harimadhav there. Do you want Harimadhav there? Then.. - Yeah, where is Tarpa? Hey, brother. Hey Tarpa, this is bigger than me. Bring it here. - Let me see. I already told Apu, I'm not good with crying. You need a professional actor for that. Why are you worrying? He'll surely get it done. Would you please check the props? When you'll take it out of your bag, when you take out the saree, she'll cry holding that. Okay? - Bring Mr Harimadhav's props. Man, couldn't it have been green for a while longer, Here, from the Charak fair, genuine Jackfruit wood. And you wanted a plate for Lakshmi. Here, I got it framed in glass. And this, for my dear Uma. A saree. What happened? What happened? Not happening. Cut it, cut it. Let's do it again, quickly. No, I know, it's not working. As I told you, I can't cry. Give me 5 minutes please. Another camera. What to do? - Let me see, reset the props. Let me see. - Sure. Come. Varuna, any problem? Problem, for sure. I'm wasting so many camera reels. Actually, as I told you, I just can't cry. You don't need to worry, you are doing good. It's just about tears, right? You just need to stare at the sun for that. Even Mr. Bhanu was saying, you just need to press a gland to cry tears. Tears are fine, but the shock, that needs to come from within. And I just can't feel that. What are Stanislavski's opinions on that? Nothing. Method acting fail. How about we try a Bangla method? Okay. - Let's go. And a saree for Uma. See, look at that. Cut. Great, amazing. Mr. Bhanu, amazing. Really, was it good? Thank you, so relieved. Good, good! It was very necessary to evoke emotions in this scene. I was a bit apprehensive while watching this scene. But when the scene was complete, with music, it felt if we left out Sarvamangala's heart-piercing cry completely from the scene, and just use wired Shehnai, it will be better for the emotions I'm trying to achieve. And it will make the scene more telling and poignant, without being unnecessarily sentimental. Amazing. Amazing! Wow, great! The impact you are looking for. This Raga 'Patdeep' that you played, is much more impactful. And the ones you played before, Purya Dhanshri, Todi, these are good but very common. Okay, Mr. Surya, let's do the rain sequence now. Yes, but I am not using 'Malhaar' in rain seqeunce. Rather, I am... using 'Desh' Raga here. Wow, this is quite celebratory. Can we hear it whole? It goes great with the theme too. Mr. Aparajito, it is virtually impossible to finish it in such little time. And with your busy schedule, you can't even give us more than a day. That's true. But with the tight deadlines you have, and you also want the music to match the scene. Okay, okay, do a thing. Just play the musical pieces a bit longer. I will cut and use it as per the scene needs. We had to finish the music in tremendous hurry, in just 11 hours. But it was still lacking in few places. For example, the sweet-seller scene. Luckily, Subir can play Sitar. But this pressure, of fighting against time, didn't spare us. And Morgan Wheeler came during this time, who's one of the directors of New York's Museum of Modern arts. He had somehow heard of our movie. The movie was not fit to be shown then. So we had to make do with shooting stills. No, no, this is such a silly painting. Here, these are the photographs. Have a look. I must say, They don't look like shooting stills, they are absolutely life-like. I wish I could show you the phone. Oh, I will, in New York. We are going to have a festival of films at MoMA, from all over the world. I want your film to be premiered there. Oh, so kind of you, Sir. Thank you, Mr. Wheeler. Thank you. And after a few days, a famous Hollywood director, John Hudson came to Kolkata while on his way to scout a location in Nepal. Morgan Wheeler had sent him to enquire, how far along are we with the film? Very good. Very nice. - Thank you. This lady had a fight and she left the house. Yeah, yeah. I understand. That's all. So, did it pass master, Mr. Hudson? Oh, it certainly did. In fact, it's quite masterful, Mr. Ray. Monroe chose the right film for his festival. Very impressive indeed. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Please come. Due to Mr. Menon's tight hand with the government money, we were quite behind the schedule. And meanwhile, the date of MoMA's premiere was here. We just had two more weeks. And there was a lot of work pending for editing and finalizing the movie. So we virtually didn't sleep for 10 days and 10 nights and somehow finished the movie. 10 days without sleep? One hour here and there. Brother Tumpa, I did it finally, the last reel is left. Just finish this too. Here, here. Brother Apu, I can't do this anymore. Should I take a nap for 15-20 minutes? And then... - Yes, I understand brother Durga, but we have to send the film tomorrow morning itself. Do a thing, just spray some water and get it done. Go, go, quick. Go! If you sleep now, you'll be in the same condition as your colleague. What happened? Why did you switch on the light? Babushona is in deep sleep. It is 3:30 p.m. there. Eastern Standard Time. Screening must be starting now. What's supposed to happen will happen. Don't stress, just sleep. I'm not feeling sleepy, Vinku. At least, give it a try. It's quite late, it should've been here by now. Apu, are you writing to Morgan? Yes, it's almost three weeks today. I don't know what's the point in writing? A movie made on the rural life of Bangla, why would the Englishmen like it? I'll check. Must have failed to engage the cultural elite of New York. The show must have been a damn straight. The film might have been a super flop. And Mr. Wheeler might be hesitant to tell us that. Apu, telegram. What does it say? What's it? A triumph of imaginative photography. Letter for us. Amazing news. - Bravo, Mr. Mitter. Congratulations. Well done, well done! - Hey Subir, bring the sweets. That 'Lengcha', yes. - Sure. So New York is done. But the movie was released in Kolkata after a long while. Before the official release here, In an elite club for the VIP's of Kolkata, a private screening was organized. I assume you got a great response. It's almost time. It will be good, we are stressing needlessly. There. Greetings. Quite good. - Thank you so much. Thank you. Coming. There they are. It was pretty good. Was it good? Good. - Oh, thank you so much. It was good. - Thank you. Thank you. - It was good. Good. It was good. We liked your movie. Rubbish, is this cinema or a documentary? - Exactly. If these cinemas are shown outside India, what would people think of us? It was good. But too long and a little slow. And quite tragic. I cried a lot. Yes, I am free, careful. Yes, please move. Oh, yes... - There is no dearth of sorrow in our life, right? And that's why people come to the cinema, to forget their sorrows. To escape the reality. This is more like an art film. While I was in the continent, I saw a few of these. A good attempt, and I do wish you the very best. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Farewell. What a damn! What a waste of Sunday afternoon. Hi. We are absolutely floored. What a film. We have never seen a movie like this before. Not even in English. - Thank you. Thank you very much. What a commendable job. I'm very impressed. Thank you so much. - Thank you, Sir. So glad you liked it. - Thank you. Thank you. See, they really liked it. Farewell, thank you. It didn't, really capture the heart of Bengalis. A very lukewarm reaction. I think the foreigners liked it more. Activate the interest toward films is so less that it takes some time to accept anything. Or with Bengalis, it can be pure jealousy as well. The main thing is that people who pay to see it should like it. It's okay, Apu, don't get so upset. What is this? What is this? You tell me, what is this? Circle picture. - What's happening here? See, he came here. Listen, the scene where the kids see the train, shouldn't that be made into a poster? Yes, this is single sheet. - Hey, you naughty. And the one you're talking about is for 10 by 20 hoarding. When is it releasing? They say it would be August. Let's see. All the best. Hey, Babu? Just two more stoppages, right? - Yes. Yes. These two, What happened, aunt? I was just looking at the poster of the film. Isn't that the film based on uncle's novel? The poster has been made by the film director himself. Really, so beautiful, right? I have never seen such posters for Bengali film before. He draws so wonderfully, right? - Yeah. After all, he is Shrikumar Ray's son. The film might have been great as well. But the story is not conventional. Who knows whether it will work? Not a problem, anyway, you could have done the whole station. Brother Apu, everything was fine. It would have been better had the holding been a bit wider. PATHER PADABALI Oh wow, a long line. Come. There's a good crowd every day. Yes, I heard it yesterday in my society, it's quite good, it seems. You didn't watched it yet? An amazing film. I have seen it once before. I brought my wife today. One for evening, upper stall. Brother, are tickets available? - Just wait. Wait, let me first ask at the counter. Two matinee show. Brother, how is it selling? Sales... Today it's 60% complete. It was running housefull yesterday. Okay, fine, let's go. Take the change. - Listen, dear. Tomorrow's a Sunday. We'll go see a matinee show. While returning from office, I took two tickets. You'll go, right? What movie are we going to watch? - Asha Jawa? Oh please, you and your hopes and dreams. You see, Pather Padabali. Padabali? - Yes. Is this a spiritual book? No, this is totally different. It's about a village. Oh, yes. Sushila told me, this is that film. Without hero-heroine, or songs. Oh, please. What's the point in spending money for such a film? Oh please, to hell with your dance and romance. It's the same boring story. Listen, my boss was telling me that day, Mukherjee, see that film. We have never had such a cinema in our country before. Oh, wow! Your boss said so? - Yes. Isn't he like a proper gentleman? Just imagine, if we don't see this film, we won't be able to face the society. Fine, let's watch it then. A pink gin for madam and for me.... - Vodka tonic? Yes. And one plate of fish fingers. Okay, sir. - Thank you. That should be alright or... Yes. - Hey? Good afternoon, PK. - Hey, hello. Hello. - Hello. Are you not coming for golf these days? No, afraid not, a lot of travelling. One tour after the other. - Uma... Okay, go, get it. - Oh, really. Why didn't you call me? - You were getting... Mr. Aparajito Ray? - Yes? Do you remember me? We met during the first screening of your film. Do you remember? - Of course, I do. And I also remember your reaction. I told my wife and everybody else, this film is going to go places. - It has. All the way to New York? - Oh, really? My boss, Mr. Newman. Not for long. - Why so? He wants to be an independent film director. And like your country, he wants to be independent too. Excellent! Well, I'll take your leave. Thank you. He seemed overwhelmed by you film. On the contrary, he seemed quite underwhelmed after the film. I told you, this film is going to be a hit. Did you? You said it will be a flop. Initially, it wasn't getting any attraction. It took a week for people to notice it's in halls. Listen dear, Bengalis have this snobbishness. It received an award or something in the English nation, and that drove the Bengalis to the theater. No matter what you say, it's a fantastic film. Capturing the rural Bangla in celluloid like this. Oh, please! All the Englishmen want to see is the poverty of our nation. They will gulp it up. Do you know why this film is getting so much attraction? Seeing the poverty and underdevelopment of our nation makes them feel superior. Poverty is porn now. - Stop your rubbish. You have no idea of what a cinema is. The praying mantis dancing in pond, the toads, the pleasure of dancing in rain, the excitement of seeing your first train, have you ever seen this pictorization before? Have you heard of eternal neo-realism? It wipes away the difference between film and reality. Exactly! Actually, we did have cinema, but the cinema didn't have its language. Pather Padabali made a Bengali, an Indian look into movie. That director was a regular here. - Exactly. Quite tall, he had a reserved table. Who knew he would do this before? Then we would have cultivated something. That's occupied. There's the chance of your cultivation. Sir, you are in queue. Brother Bishu, how come you are calling me sir? Really... Sunil... - Can we take that table? Yes, sir. That table... - If I could get an autograph? Go ahead. You'll have to give a lot of photographs. Nothing to be ashamed of. - Yeah, right. Welcome to celebrity hood. Come. Shiela was right. You funded the right film. I told him to change the end. It's a sad ending. But he didn't agree with me. That would have been an absolute disaster. No, this is just perfect! This family from a small village, moving out into the wide world, this is just a perfect ending. Well done, young man. I have never seen such a wonderful movie in my life. I'm proud of you. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ray. This has been a wonderful experience for me. Ray? I'll definitely have a word with the I&amp;B ministry. As per the Bombay Film college, they have no idea of what an artistic cinema is? I'll see to it that it definitely goes to Cannes, Roy. The very first film, going to a festival like Cannes. And getting the prestigious award of best human document. The taste of success, will you please share it with our listeners? See, I couldn't go to Cannes then I heard it later, and this was written about as well. You must have read it. Of course I did, but if you could say. My movie was shown towards the end of the festival. Also, the auditorium where the screening happened was relatively smaller. Where unimportant films generally get screened. There were very few people watching it as well. And I think in the entire festival, after watching all the famous films and partying till late in the night, people were tired. And initially even the audience was little restless. Rumour has it that a famous critic just walked out. Sister, have you ever watched a train? Yes. The uncivilised natives were eating with their hands. He could not take it. Even I have heard about it. A diary of cinema's Francois Truffaut commented it as: "Pad, pad, pad through the paddy fields." Although later, he denied everything about it. Then ultimately it happened what was meant to be. I can understand you are being a bit hesitated. To talk about that day. In that case, let me recreate that moment again. In the magazine, Film Buff, McSeaton... has described the occassion. "Unheralded at Cannes," "Pather Padavali was announced for screening." "On a sultry afternoon..." "towards the end of the festival." "A somewhat distraught audience..." "bored by too many cocktail parties..." "and an endless parade of films gathered to see it." "The critics who were there, expected nothing more..." "than the usual Indian films." "With dances, songs," "sacred cows and melodrama." "and the first moments seemed to confirm their worst suspicions." "For those who remained," "the unexpected began to happen." "Suddenly, the audience realised..." "that the magic horse of poetry was invading the screen." "The breadth of the story became large." "And the purity of the images" "corresponded to the purity of the subject." "The people who were fidgeting, became still." "The murmurs died out." "And there was utter silence in the auditorium." "Everyone was witnessing..." "the magic of cinema." "They were wonderstruck." "And then, once the film ended, they all stood up." "To get a long, standing ovation." Now I am calling on stage, Mr. Aparajito Ray. Come. Thank you. Congratulations. And I am feeling very proud to let you all know. That one of our members' film... has been awarded as the 'best human document' in the France's famous Cannes Film Festival. This is the first time any Indian Film Director has received this prestigious award. Holding Pather Padavali's hands, Bangla and Indian Cinema has reached into the World stage. Now I would request Aparajito to share his experiences with us. Greetings. Receiving this award, I am elated and proud. But receiving the acceptance and acknowledgement from... the people of my city and country, gives a different kind of happiness. Won't they give us? The way I am being felicitated in different parts of the city, I am overwhelmed. ANANDABAZAR MAGAZINE HUGE PUBLIC FELICIATION IN SENATE HAL Your Tea. Yes. - What are you thinking? I am thinking, the people who were involved with this movie, all of them are getting felicitated. But one person missed all of this. Nonibala Devi. - Exactly. One of the best performances in the World cinema. I agree. But you know what do I think? The first day you showed that film to her, I saw a smile of satisfaction on her face. Maybe she also understood that the film was going to become huge. I also miss her. Especially, her toothless smile. Brilliant! I am remembering one more incident. "Lord, the day has passed," "evening has beckoned, pass me through everything." "Lord, the day has passed," "evening has beckoned, pass me through everything." Brother Apu, Nonibala Devi's part is done. Yes, it's her pack up. Send her home. What's this? She is still acting being dead here? Nonibala Devi? Nonibala Devi? Nonibala Devi? - Yes. Please get up. The shot is done. What is done? Your part is done. Why are you lying down? Please get up. Done? - Yes. But nobody has said 'cut'. I have been lying down holding my breath all this while. Okay, okay. Cut, cut. Wow! Ultimately even Naivedya admired your film? I feel as if I am in a deep trance, Apu. How did it all happen? I think that the entire universe conspire to make things happen. But, do you know what I think? Behind all of this happening, we cannot take away the due credit from your white owl as well. Whether it is due to the own merit of the film... or due to the hoots of the white owl. It's admiration would only be wide-spread. I don't have a speck of doubt about that. I certainly know that this film would keep... inspiring many film enthusiasts and film directors for the years to come. AFTER 10 YEARS Hello? - 'Hello.' 'Hello, hello. Mr. Aparajito Ray?' Yes, that's correct. 'There is a call for you from New York, USA.' New York? - 'Yes.' Okay, put me through. - 'Hold on.' 'Sir, is that Mr. Aparajito Ray?' Yes, that's correct. 'Sir, I am a student at the New York University.' 'I first watched your film.' 'Pather Padavali a couple of years back on television' 'but that was the dubbed version.' 'But last night, I watched the whole trilogy, back to back.' 'The way how cinema-men would have it.' 'With proper subtitles and all.' 'Can you hear me, Sir?' - Yes, clearly. 'Mr. Ray, I got your phone number from an Indian classmate.' 'Sir, your films simply blew my mind.' Thank you very much. Thank you for taking the trouble of calling me all the way from New York. And letting me know. It's very encouraging indeed. But I didn't get your name. 'My name is Martin, Sir.' 'Martin Scottish.' Thank you, Martin. Thank you for your kind words. 'My pleasure, Sir. All the best. Goodbye.' Bye-bye.
