Now, no more questions. It's time to go to sleep. - Please, Miss Justin, leave the door open. I'm a little girl. - Nonsense, child. You have to learn to conquer your silly fears.

Please. - My husband believes that he'd only go after Jews and communists. This is Johnny's room. What do people say in England? - Oh, in London, people are afraid. - Of Hitler? Oh, come on. He's a maniac. You shouldn't take him that seriously. - People are afraid of war. - And this is your room. - Ah. - I hope you'll find it comfortable. - Oh, I'm sure I will. - You're too pretty to be a governess. - Oh, I think a good position in a respectable house is fit for any lady. - Well this is your kingdom. The playroom. For rainy days and for after sundown. This way, please. Cipriano, Martinez. This is the little crying room for when I'm sad. (birds chirping) - Oh, how lovely. - Come and meet my mother-in-law. Mama Victoria? Mama Victoria? It's Miss Mary, the new governess. - Oh yes, yes. - Come and meet the children. - [Mary] So you're Teresa. May I call you Terry? - It's a dog's name. - It's lovely. - That's what we'd call you in England. - But we're not in England. - And who are you, may I ask? - I'm Isadora Duncan. The dancer who passed away, strangled by herself. - You don't say "passed away", Carolina. - And why can't I say "passed away"? - Because that's the way the servants talk, to us it's died. - Hello, I'm Johnny. (gong ringing) - Lunch is served. He's my father. (birds chirping) - My daughters are not to be out of your sight a single moment. - I thought, um, this was a safe country. - No woman is safe as long as there are men around. You should know that. What made you come to Argentina? - I enjoy traveling and, well, I knew there was a great demand for a qualified governesses in Argentina. I have no income. - But lovely blue eyes. Or are they violet? Now, I expect you to teach my daughters a little of everything. English, history, needlework, art, et cetera. But above all, I want them well brought up and closely supervised. - May I say senor, that all the young ladies I have brought up have attained the state of marriage in an eminently suitable condition. - My daughters are difficult. The eldest wants to be an actress. Their mother is hopeless, much too soft. You are the seventh governess to enter this house. So if you think it necessary, you may use a cane. - Oh. - I was often caned when I went to school in England. - Well, I hope we shall not need to use it. - You're a Catholic, I presume. - It's in the contract. - Good, good. I also want lots of religion. - Yes. - Religion keeps women out of trouble. (faint piano music) (birds squawking) (somber piano music) - Dead, dead, alive, dead, alive. Dead, dead, alive.

So these things wouldn't happen. Come on. Where's your sense of humor? Pick a cue. How do you find the new governess? - An English woman? - (chuckles) One can't hate you. You're so consistent. - And for you that's a mistake. - No, let's just say an exaggeration. - You know what drives me mad? That they're fighting a cause for people like you. - That's the way it is, Ernesto. Either with us or with the communists. (billiard balls clack) - [Mary] Hurry up girls, it's time to go to bed. You're not to lock yourselves in the bathroom. - Coming, Miss Mary. We are brushing our teeth. (liquid trickling) - Oh, disgusting. It's warm. - Keep still. - Now I don't want you to go to the bathroom together in future, is that clear? - Miss Mary, we have a welcome present for you. - Oh, how nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. (sniffs loudly) So. This is Argentine perfume. (bottle thunks) (door slams) (somber piano music) - Dead. Dead. Alive. How fortunate that Di Bosio died.

They're warm and friendly and the two little girls are delightful. The low, white Spanish house has a large patio in which this evening, the whole family danced the tango to the sound of throbbing guitars. (Mary sobbing) (Mary sniffling) It was lovely to watch.

(car rumbling) (people speaking Spanish) - [Mary] Once upon a time in a huge, splendid palace lived an old king. His name was King Lear. It was winter and the snow was falling gently. Now the king had three daughters, Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. And as he was getting old, he had decided to share his kingdom between them. So he called them to him in his palace and asked them, which of you loves me the most? (people speaking Spanish) (people continue speaking Spanish) (people continue speaking Spanish) (people continue speaking Spanish) - And then, poor King Lear finally died because his sorrow and his grief were greater than his madness.

Now you are a woman, Caroline. - You mean she's going to have a baby? - No, I mean that now she is able to have a baby. - [Teresa] When? - You grow up and get married. - What happens when I marry? Well, you see, you have little eggs inside your body and men have little pockets with seeds in them. Tiny, tiny, tiny little seeds. - Where? - Between their legs. And when they get married they drop those seeds into their wife's body and the seed meets the egg, and the egg grows. - Inside my body? - Not in yours, in mine. How does the seed get there? - Never mind Caroline, you'll find that all out when you get married. - Miss Mary, do you mean to say my father did that to my mother? - [Mary] You wouldn't be here otherwise, dear. - No wonder Mother's always crying. I'm never going to marry. I'm never going to be a woman. - I'm happy to be one. I'm proud. Let's celebrate. Let's have a party. - Never. You are not to talk about this. - Why? - Because you are not to. This is a secret amongst women. - But why? - Alright, Caroline, come to bed. Oh, don't jump like that. Just try to keep quiet. (Caroline giggling) Arms down the side of your body. Knees down, keep the circulation going. There, you'll be alright. - I'm not feeling bad. - Never mind, you have to stay in bed for three days. No riding, no swimming and no washing your hair for a week. - But why? - Because you are unwell. - (laughing) I'm not. - Yes you are, and don't argue about it. Good night dear.

He didn't like to be that way. But you see he couldn't help it. One morning he comes and gives me a pile of money. "What's this?" I ask him. "It's for you, buy yourself something nice." He tells me. "And even if I myself ask you for it back," he says, "don't give it to me." All right, I told him. That night there he is. "Give me back the money." (laughs) What? "My daughter has to have an urgent operation." You are lying, Pacheco. (chuckles) I won't give it back to you. Oh, he got mad. He had a fit. Called me all sorts of names. So I gave him back his money and he left. A short while later, there he is again, angrier than ever with the money in his hand. Why did you give it back? Didn't I tell you not to? You want me to be a miser all my life? And he left with all the money. (all laughing) - What did she say? (Alfredo laughing) What did she say? - Nothing. - I loved him. - How old are you Miss Mary? - Ask no questions and you'll get no lies. (server speaking Spanish) Two, please. - You could say "dos, por favor."

May times. - Oh Caroline, that's not fair, I never told you that. - [Girl Doll] And who's the soldier in the picture you keep in your trunk? - [Mary Doll] Oh he's- - May I ask you, young lady, what you were doing prying in my room? - [Girl Doll] Johnny told me about that picture. - Johnny. - Did you love the soldier? - Yes I did. - Why didn't you marry him? - Because he never came back from the war. - Was he killed? - I don't know. - [Mary Doll] Enough questions, young ladies. We're just on time for some homemade (indistinct). - Oh, Miss Mary, you shouldn't. Not just before supper. (somber piano music) - Now, a firm tap. (billiard balls clack) (Perla laughing) Thanks. Okay, try again. Now, let me show you. - Oh yes, yes, yes. - Your eyes must be level with the table. (Ernesto chuckles) Take a good hold of it. A firm tap now. - Yes. (billiard balls clack) - Excellent. - Oh. (both laughing) - You see it's not very difficult. - Yes. - Try again. - Wait. - Yes. (Alfredo clears throat) - Uncle Ernesto? Uncle Ernesto. - What is it? - Bad news. The radio said that Lugones is dead. They're saying he committed suicide. I thought I had to tell you. - Excuse me. - Ghastly, isn't it? Who is Lugones? (laughing) - (laughing) He's a good poet, but with no sense of humor. He thought General Uriburu was a hero. He started messing in politics and that's no job for a delicate soul. Your eyes level with the table. (crickets chirping) (animals chittering) (cue striking) (billiard balls clacking) (Alfredo breathing heavily) (gun firing) (glass shattering) - Mecha! Mecha!

It's alright. - No it wasn't. It's the mafia. They're coming to kidnap me. - Enough. Enough, Caroline. - [Teresa] Mum is crying. - Yes, darling, she's crying because she's nervous. She's nervous Because of the accident. - Maybe she's gone crazy. - You shut up. - Miss Mary, do you think my family's mad? Do you believe we have too much money?

(children giggling) - What on earth are you doing? - I'm Robert Taylor and she's Loretta Young. We are in love. - You are not to kiss on the mouth. - [Teresa] Why? - Because it's unhealthy. And you are not to play with flies. - Why? - [Mary] Because it's also unhealthy. (fly swatter smacks) (somber piano music) - Has President Ortiz been sworn in yet? - Yes. Mother. - What? - [Alfredo] Yes, mother. He's sworn in. - About time. We've had enough of that socialist. - No mother. The socialist was Juan B. Justo. And he died long ago. The last president was Augustine P. Justo. - Exactly, a socialist. It's unheard of. - Aren't you going to eat anything? (birds squawking) - She's going to the little crying room. - How do you know? - I saw her yesterday- - Little girls should be seen and not heard. - What's socialist? - In England, we call them robbers. Now Terry, sit up straight. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (organ playing wedding music) (people chanting) Who are these people? Where are they all coming from? (Johnny speaking in Spanish) Why don't you speak to me in English? - Because when I speak in English, I feel like an actor. - And when you speak in Spanish? - When I speak in Spanish too. Mother told us you'd returned to England. - Well, I didn't. I like Buenos Aires, so. It's so clean and so peaceful and so, so far away from that dreadful bombing. - And I was so worried about you all during the war. - Well go on. Go on about Terry, but in English. - Well, one day, one stupid day on a stupid yacht, something stupid happened. Damn party was supervised by a bunch of chaperones. Friends of my mother. (jazz music) - Oh, how could you! This is outrageous. In my own yacht, get out of here. Get out of here at once, you hear me? Get out! In my very own yacht. Come back immediately! (water splashes) Terry, come back! How dare you, under my very nose! This is a scandal. Wait 'til I tell your mother. Come back! Come back at once. Terry. Terry! (dramatic music) (typewriter clacking) (door clicks) - Carolina. I did it. - What? - I'm no longer a virgin. (giggles) I slept with Toribio. - Is it nice? - I don't know. - Where's Terry? - So you know, quick service. - You prefer father to know? - Terry doesn't love Toribio. - I don't care. Where is she? (typewriter clacking) What are you doing? - I'm copying the phone book. (typewriter dings) The psychiatrist told me it would do me lots of good. (swords clanging) - Wait till I go and change. - I'm in a hurry. And you know what I've come for. - You needn't have bothered. I know exactly what I'm supposed to do. - Then do it. I'm still asking myself, whose name was I trying to protect? Whose honor? - Nonsense. You did your duty as the eldest brother. Remember who you are. - You talk like my father. - Yes. Was he very angry? - He's never very angry. He doesn't have to be. - What about Peron? Isn't he angry with Peron? - Not even with him. - So what does he have to say about this rabble rouser? - He says we made a terrible mistake when we defeated the British army. - The British Army, defeated? Here? - Yes. Twice. 1806. 1807. (Mary laughing) - Oh, Johnny, stop pulling my leg. - I'm serious. If we hadn't defeated the English, we now would be an ex-British colony. - I don't see the advantage, sir. - Can you imagine Peron in Canada? - Must we talk about this fellow every day? - You think it best to ignore the danger? - The best way to end that danger is to negotiate with Peron. - Never, that would be treason. - Have no fear, Toribio. We are not that smart. We are going to fight him. (band playing jazz music) - Your attention, please. Please. I have wonderful news for all of you, especially for his excellency, the British ambassador. Our dear friend, Sir David Kelly. (crowd applauding) - Thank you. - I want to tell you that thanks to your generous contributions this evening, we have collected sufficient funds for us to buy two ambulances, fully equipped for the field hospital of the British Army. (crowd applauding) - Thanks. - I have something here for you. (Sir Kelly laughing) (crowd laughing and applauding) Isn't he lovely? - Very funny. - It looks like you. (band playing jazz music) (crowd chattering) - Can you take me home? I want to leave. - Why don't you stay a little while longer? This is just beginning. - Will you take me or won't you? - [Johnny] Excuse us, please. - Oh, sorry, so sorry. - Don't touch a thing. Go away. (car rumbling) (drawers rattling) - The key. The key. (dramatic music) (box rattling) (door closes) - Do you think my family's mad? Do you believe we have too much money? Johnny, please. Perhaps Caroline was right. Maybe it's us that's fucked up. - Johnny, I'm ashamed of you. A young officer using words like that. What are you smiling at? - You sound like a governess. I like it. - I don't want you talking about your family like that. Caroline is sick, it's true, but she's seeing a doctor and she'll soon be as healthy as she was before. You have a pretty wife and you'll someday have some wonderful children. And Terry made a beautiful bride. - [Johnny] May I come in? (man speaking French) - [Carolina] Come in. - [Johnny] You look beautiful. - [Terry] I don't want to get married. - Would you wait outside for a moment please? (man speaking French) - Please. (man speaking French) - What's wrong, Terry? - Didn't you hear her? - I don't want to get married. - You're just nervous. - I don't want to get married. - Come on Johnny. Bring the car around the back door and we'll go out the balcony and the three of us go far away. - Stop talking nonsense, Carolina. Everything's going to be all right. Toribio is a good fellow. And you've received more than a thousand presents. You can't do this to people. - I'm not going to the church. - [Johnny] Carolina. - I'm not. - Carolina, come here. Carolina. - [Carolina] I'm not going. - [Johnny] Carolina. Carolina. - I'm not. I'm not going. - Doesn't she have a young man? Doesn't Caroline have a nice young man who can look after her? - She can choose anyone she wants, but she drives them away. She talks to them with such strange words. They can't understand her. What does she want? (banging on door) - What the hell do you want? If Caroline wants to stay, let her stay. If she wants to stay forever, let her stay forever. - Excuse me, the bishop is waiting. - We're coming. - What if I spoke to her? - Tell that woman to shut up. - That woman is my wife, Mecha. - Precisely. Have her shut up. - Tell your sister that if she didn't wear glasses, I'd slap her. - Perla, please. - What did she say? - Carolina? Carolina.
