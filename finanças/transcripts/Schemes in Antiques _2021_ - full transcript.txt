ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME BY MA BOYONG THIS STORY IS FICTIONAL. ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE COINCIDENTAL. Wu Zetian, a Tang dynasty empress and Buddhist, built the Imperial Temple Hall. There she honored a jade statue of Maitreya, the ultimate Bodhisattva. Sometime later, the hall was burned down by Xue Huaiyi. The statue's head broke off from its body. And this precious Buddha head thereby vanished. In early 1910s, five major antique dealers formed the Plum Blossom Five. Through their dedicated efforts, they finally found the Buddha head and have secretly protected it ever since. But because of one man, this national treasure was lost overseas, leading to disaster. This man is about to be executed. CONDEMNED TRAITOR, XU YICHENG He was the Five's fourth-generation head. Xu Yicheng. And it was he who gifted the Buddha head to a Japanese man named Yuzo Kido. Xu Yicheng was a traitor. He is also my grandpa. This boy is Xu Heping. He is my dad. Don't feel bad for him. He is no angel. When I was seven, he abandoned me. It all started with that Buddha head. My family became the pariahs of the antique world. Traitors. Scum. Those became our names. Dad! Whoever comes here at the right time... But these days, no one cares about true antiques. Nowadays, in the trade, everyone goes crazy about their own pieces. There is riffraff all around. Only two kinds of people exist. Swindlers and their fool victims. Please take a look. The first treasure is a Han dynasty golden flying bear seal. - It has been authenticated - Look. By the Plum Blossom Five. No! What does he want? You said that yours is authentic. Then what is mine? Do you think that this seal comes in pairs? Old man, it's not like the lovebirds on your wedding quilt. Then explain it to me. Otherwise, I won't leave. - I'm working. - Fifty. I offer 50 yuan. This is me. I'm different from them. I'm the third kind. WHITE The Plum Blossom Five. Blue, Red, Black, Yellow, and White. The Blue House are wood specialists. Red House, calligraphy and paintings. Black House, porcelains. Yellow House, bronzes. White House, gems and jewelry. Today, I will show off my skills for your expert eyes! Is he serious? He's just a fraud. Han dynasty seals were made by poured casting. Trapped air creates an unstable base. So genuine pieces have a heavier bottom and tip over easily. Yours is too stable. This flaw gives it away. My family's heirloom is worth nothing now. I was hoping that in the future it would... Don't be upset. On behalf of the Plum Blossom Five, I'll help you out. I'll buy this fake for 50 yuan. - Good! - Thank you. - Good man! - Well done! You will? Thank you so much! Thank you. - I'll take it. - Wonderful! In the name of the Plum Blossom Five, he has revealed the forgery! - Good job! - Well done! - Bravo! - Nice one! What do you want? You have the wrong guy! Young man, you can fool outsiders. But me? - No way. - This is a fake. Sell it to me for 500 yuan and we'll be friends. Thanks to that Buddha head, my family was pariahs in the antique world. I fulfilled expectations and became scum among scum. What's wrong? But I never imagined that the Buddha head would seek me out again. RELEASE CONFERENCE FOR BUDDHA HEAD OF WU ZETIAN'S IMPERIAL TEMPLE HALL Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Plum Blossom Five, I welcome all of you to this Buddha head release conference. With support and supervision from relevant departments, this Chinese treasure lost overseas for 50 years has finally returned to us. Let me introduce the next speaker, Ms. Kana Kido. RELEASE CONFERENCE FOR BUDDHA HEAD OF WU ZETIAN'S IMPERIAL TEMPLE HALL I am Kana Kido, descendant of Yuzo Kido. Returning the Buddha head was my grandpa, Yuzo Kido's dying wish. He wanted the treasure to be returned to its home. It had always been my grandpa's wish. But considering it was a gift from Mr. Xu Yicheng to my grandpa, I request that a descendant of Mr. Xu Yicheng be at the handover ceremony to accept the Buddha head. - An outrageous request! - Where would we find a descendant? - It's absurd. - That's right. Mr. Huang, I am so sorry. Ms. Kido insists on this. I hope you can understand. We have made arrangements according to our contract. Now, with your request, we must find a Xu descendant. It's possible, but I must stress this. Ever since Xu Yicheng's only son, Xu Heping, vanished, the Xus have no more descendants. Mr. Liu. Yanyan. Mr. Huang. Why are you here? Mr. Liu let me help out in the handover ceremony. Mr. Huang, I asked Yanyan to help you. She has always wanted to do something for the Five. And she's your granddaughter. How can you help? Ms. Kido. Per your request, I have found a Xu family descendant. FILE ENVELOPE You're back. Liu Bin, I'll bring you my television set to fix. - Put it on my tab. - Has my semiconductor been fixed? I'll do it when the triode arrives. It's taking so long. You're such an alcoholic. It was a great scheme that you almost ruined with drink. Can't I drink on my mom's birthday? Every day is her birthday. BIG FOUR ELECTRONICS REPAIR Antiques are all the rage now. Forget about repairing electronics. If we do this more often, we will be able to buy a luxe city house. I don't want these ill-gotten gains. Not "ill-gotten gains" but schemes. That gold seal was fake. I didn't lie. Are you clean now? Clean, yet you pay rent on time. Here. Don't say I never gave you anything. Mom. Happy birthday. Is it your mom's birthday? Who are you? Watch your language. Among the tricksters abusing the Plum Blossom Five's name, you're the worst off. A police officer? You're just with the Five! Are you Xu Yuan? No, my surname is Liu. You're mistaken. I just had a drunken fit. Get out. Liu Bin. Real name, Xu Yuan. You lost your home in a big fire in 1972. Your mom died in the fire. Your dad, Xu Heping, rescued you, put you in a friend's home in Fushun, and vanished. Isn't that true? I don't know any Xu Heping. Get out. Get out. Your dad is dead. PUBLIC SECURITY FORENSIC CENTER AUTOPSY LABORATORY I've suspected for years that your dad's disappearance was related to the Buddha head. But in the Plum Blossom Five, only Mr. Liu believed me. Last week, just as I had finally located Xu Heping, he got into a car accident and died. Just as Kana Kido wants to return the Buddha head, Xu Heping dies. His death is not that simple. I'll be back for you soon. Dad! You're lying! Dad! No. I'll give it to you if you win. Son. There you are. I've made my move. It's your turn. Now you think of me. It's too late. Do you admit defeat? Then no candy for you. Come. This is what the deceased held in his hand. His family should take it. I don't want it. Stick with the procedure. Take it. Sign here. Ms. Kido. We'll keep the Buddha head here for now. Professionals will deliver it to the ceremony. Sorry that I'm late. Mr. Liu. These are the stars of the antique industry. We came today in hopes of seeing the Buddha head. Wu Zetian ordered Xue Huaiyi to build the Imperial Temple Hall. Countless treasures were stored within, but none compares with this jade Maitreya statue's head made in Wu Zetian's image. Ms. Kido. Such a rare treasure should be received by a suitable person. There is someone I wish to recommend to you. It's the grandson of Yao Lai, the head of the Black House in the Plum Blossom Five. He is Yao Buran. Yao Buran has just returned from his studies in England. Hello, Ms. Kido. I am Yao Buran. All seniors here should know. My grandpa, Yao Lai, was Xu Yicheng's good friend. They discovered the Buddha head together. I wonder if you feel I am qualified to receive the head. What do you think? Mr. Liu. I've brought Xu Yuan of the Xu family. Are you Xu Yuan? Letting a traitor's progeny do this important deed will make us the world's laughingstock. Who will be responsible if he damages the Buddha head? Mr. Huang, I found the man. I know you criticize everything I do. But I'm doing this for our nation's relic. Can you afford to take the fall? Don't cause trouble. Yanyan, Mr. Huang. It's for the good of the ceremony. That's exactly the reason we can't let him receive it. Look at him. What are you doing? - Are you okay? - Touching artifacts after drinking. That's unprofessional, like a Xu. Who I am is none of your business. I am an amateur. I repair electronics. Go back to repairing your electronics. Don't embarrass us. Speaking of which, when it comes to antiques, you might not be any better than me. Do you know what an antique is? Let's compete then. You're so drunk. How can you compete? Ms. Kido would like to see them compete. If Mr. Xu loses, she will withdraw her request. If that is what Ms. Kido wants, I agree with it. All right. If I win, I want to touch the head. The source and authenticity of these artifacts are recorded here. You each have ten minutes. You will be judged on quantity and accuracy. You may start now. Song dynasty Hutian sgraffito floral glazed conical bowl, also known as a Baby Bowl. The lines on its surface were first made in the unmolding process, then carved inside and out with bamboo blades. A moment of negligence would ruin it. Although it has been repaired, it is light and transparent. It's a rare genuine piece. All correct. Wake up. How can you fall asleep? Bring me that bowl. Why? Do you want to puke again? Qianlong era blue and white "dragon" jardiniere. Both of them are. It's hard to tell if they're real. But look closely at the coloring. The left one looks nonuniform, brittle, and insubstantial. The right one has a light sheen, but isn't overly glossy. This is called the jade texture. Their glazes are different. The paler one is made of cheap Yunnan glaze while the bolder blue one is made of expensive Zhejiang glaze. Now look at the dragons. The left one is crude. It has shape but no spirit, like a long worm. The right one is lively, exuding the aura of a dragon. The artists' mindsets were different. Now look at the written dates. It was made during Qing Emperor Qianlong's reign. The Guangxu has one hill. Qianlong, two. So The Guangxu is an imitation of the Qianlong. This was made in Qianlong's time. That's the real and the fake. All correct. The fake drunkard is sober. Next. Pretty good, right? Pretty good, right? Chibi Scroll. No problem is seen in the drawing technique, but the flaw is in the silk backing. The backing was dyed with gardenia, black tea, and acorn shells, then made brittle under ultraviolet light. It could be mistaken for the real deal, but the forgers neglected one thing. Wu Yuanzhi was an artist for Emperor Zhangzong of Jin. He painted in the Royal Study. Their silk backings have double warp and single weft threads. So a double weave. This painting is on a single weave. This was typically used by ordinary folks. So it's a contemporary imitation. All correct. Sacrificial blue-glazed garlic-mouth vase. The firing process of the vase requires 1,280 degrees Celsius. This gold process requires 700 degrees Celsius. Repeated rubbing would wear off the gold. It's a high-class imitation. All correct. A pair of Liao dynasty Cizhou sgraffito "Peony" vases. The shape is wrong. The base would not flare out like this. This is modern crafting. A fake. All correct. A few post-Ming Buddha statues were stone. This is a rare treasure. All correct. Cocoon Jar, Han dynasty. The patina and unearthing marks cannot be forged. It's genuine. All correct. Qianlong era sacrificial blue-glazed bottle vase. Even and uncracked glaze and homogenous color. - It's genuine. - All correct. One minute left. Both have 19 pieces. Sancai-glazed Goose dish, Tang dynasty. The green glaze is reflective like dragonfly wings. An imitation's color would be darker. One can tell that it is definitely genuine. All correct. Three. Two. One. Time is up. You're crazy! Yao Buran, 20 pieces. This is fake. You're wrong. Xu Yuan, 19 pieces. This is genuine. Every step was certified. It's clearly stated in the file. You all are mistaken. Since you broke it, how can you prove anything? In making the fake Buddha head, they used a very rare method called Mao Tuo. It can impeccably replicate moss and erosion marks. And when dropped onto the ground, the pieces are roughly the same size, and the edges are blunt. The genuine ones are sandstone. It shatters into smithereens. I wouldn't have guessed so until I spied the stone interior through existing cracks. We should live up to our motto. "Ridding the fake, preserving the real." Xu Yuan. Didn't you want to feel the Buddha head? An ushnisha at the top and counterclockwise curls. That is in the Mathura style. On crafting and materials, it's in the Tang dynasty style. The sole exception is the crown. It is rough in appearance due to the wrong polishing method. The correct way uses softer jade-grinding sand sourced from a spring. But forgers used harder river and quartz sands which left scratch marks. If you don't look carefully, they can easily be mistaken for erosion. I'm sure of it. This is a flaw. And someone left it there on purpose. The head is fake. Mr. Xu. May I speak to you in private? After Grandpa passed away, I got a letter from Mr. Xu Heping. Mr. Huang thinks the letter was forged. International experts believe the head is genuine. Xu Heping knew the Buddha head was fake? More than anyone else, I wish he gave away a fake Buddha head. But antique authentication is based on evidence. To maintain his status, Mr. Huang insisted the Buddha head was genuine. Now, even if we feel it may be fake, we must have evidence. So many people wish to receive the Buddha head, but I only chose you. If Grandpa had given away a fake Buddha head back then, the genuine Buddha head must still be here. Xu Heping discovered the truth. That's why he died. If he wanted to leave anything behind, it would've been to you. A Detached Boat Radical coin? It is the symbol of Lao Chaofeng. It's a code name. No one has met him. We only know that a smuggling and forgery organization is behind the name. I suppose we're not the only ones who want the Buddha head. Yao Buran, you are the only person remaining in your clan. Bring the Buddha head back uneventfully and I may consider letting the Yaos back into the Five. Xu Yuan, I hope you can find it before the ceremony. Use the handover ceremony to reveal the truth. You can also restore your family's good name. It's your only chance. I've examined the Buddha head too. There is no way the experts were unaware of the issues. But Mr. Huang certified it. No one dared challenge him. So you've already decided. There's a problem with the Buddha head. Yet you choose to accept it for the Five? The Buddha head must be accepted. But not this one. Hello? Who are you? Mr. Xu. We're closed. Go away. Enough. Our boss wants to talk business with you. Who talks business like this? Tell me where Xu Heping hid the Buddha head. I broke it. You're as stupid as your dad. Well, let us help you. Restore your family's good name. It's your only chance. - Are you clean now? - Your dad is dead. You're as stupid as your dad. Who will be responsible if he damages it? This is important. How can we let a traitor's progeny do it? Don't embarrass us. Do you admit defeat? Then no candy for you. If you want to play, then let's play. Boss, your order has been carried out. Xu Yuan is on the way. This fire has finally begun to burn. Only a Xu can solve his family's puzzle. Xu Heping used to live here. The room furthest inside. Someone has been here. I'm sure they didn't find whatever they were after. Something is off about this compass. Look at it. It won't point south. "Yin is within Yang, not opposing Yang." What does that mean? Why did your dad hide these antiques here? This isn't an antique, right? That's the game. Hutian celadon jar. Wrong glaze color. A fake. Two seated Buddhas in iron. Wrong forge shape. Fake. This Longquan piece is genuine. Fake. This is Morse code. Look at the first group. A dot represents a fake. A dash represents a genuine item. Fake, fake, genuine, fake. Dot, dot, dash, dot. Looks like Xu Yuan has been here. Dad and son are interesting. Dot, dot, dash. Dash, dash, dot. Dot, dot, dash. Fake, fake. They like playing with Morse code. Morse code? What is the answer? Fu? Fugui? Fugui. Fu Gui. Mr. Liu and I investigated this guy. Back in the day, he was friends with your dad and grandpa. Help me find someone. Let's go. Don't just stand there. Come on. Let me tell you. This mission is very dangerous. I'm doing it for the national treasure. You shouldn't participate. You're just like my grandpa. You both think only men can do things. Let me tell you. I'll find the head even without you. I'm the one leading you now. HUAQING HOTSPRINGS That's him. Don't you have a more recent picture? You're lucky I even found this. I've heard that he is inside. MEN Hey! Dude! You, dude! Are you here to bathe or not? I'm bathing. - Bathing? - I've already paid. - Who is Fu Gui? - I'll reimburse you. Come out if you don't want to be jailed! Are you Fu Gui? Are you Fu Gui? Are you? I'm asking you! Fu Gui! This place isn't for you. Get out now! Let go. I'm looking for someone. - Fu Gui! - Look at the mess you made. Fu Gui! Fu Gui! This technique of yours... Eight generations old. It looks unremarkable. It hasn't been passed to me yet. Are you really blind? Totally. Fu Gui? Yes? Who is Fu Gui? I don't know him. Time is up. Perfect. Give me a massage too. - We can talk. - Sure. Let me get a drink first. I'll wait. Lie down. I'll be right back. Freeze! Stay still. Come here. Aren't you blind? You run really fast. Fu Gui. Spring Light Hotel. Rose Hostel. Lily Motel. And now, Huaqing Hotsprings. You're hard to find. Is it a crime to have several girlfriends? Do you recognize these? YUNNAN GROTTOES What is your relationship with the Xus? Xu Heping is my dad. He left us clues to seek you out. You've grown so much. When did you last see Xu Heping? Over a month ago. What did you two talk about? We didn't talk much. He just gave me a bronze mirror. It had a lot of birds on it. Where is the mirror? We all run into hard luck sometimes. Did you sell it? To whom? Kui Market's Lord Shen. Kui Market is the most famous of the nine underground antique markets. Lord Shen is never seen and stays away from the authorities. But don't worry. The treasure is still here. Here we are. This is an underground auction site. Old, new, loot, and grey market goods. Everything is here. That's the one. Tonight, on behalf of Lord Shen, I thank you for attending the auction. Song dynasty peacock and lotus flower mirror. The auction will begin soon. Please return to your seats. Thank you, everyone. Do you plan to bid or steal? Folks, the first item today is a Warring States era jade dragon-phoenix double-ring. Its most interesting feature is the interlocking structure. Mercury has turned it dark and shiny, which shows that it is over 2,000 years old. "Yin is within Yang, not opposing Yang." It's 150,000 yuan, going once. Have you located Lord Shen? - Not yet. - It's 150,000 yuan, going twice. It's 150,000 yuan, three times. Sold! In this auction, - half of the items are fake. - Congratulations to this gentleman - The real items are outrageously priced. - For winning this exquisite double-ring. - Items worth 80,000 yuan at most - More magnificent items - are sold for at least twice that. - Are coming up. - Folks, you're in luck today. - Will we see Lord Shen today? - I told you, Lord Shen is never seen. - I hope you bid to your heart's content - Give me all the money you have. - And bring something home! We only brought 50,000 yuan. - It is not enough. - Okay, - There is no time to go get more. - Let's continue with the bidding. The second item. Okay, the second item... That's all I have. Here's an extra ten yuan. Watch the mirror. Don't let anyone buy it. Stall for time. Don't let the mirror be sold. I have an idea. What are you doing? I'm finding treasures. Do you want to flip overlooked antiques? There are no overlooked antiques here. You just can't tell. Watch me. Here, look at this. It's not small. Great eye. Ming gilt bronze Buddha figure. It's yours for 500 yuan. It's worth 100 yuan at most. Take a look. Okay. Here's 200 yuan. Throw in something small. - This one will do. - Okay, go ahead. Stop examining it. Toss it. What? Do you see this? Heliotrope in rich vermilion. It's just a little dark. Couldn't the sellers tell? If they had the ability, they wouldn't be hawking here. Kids. How would you like to make some money? - Sure! - Okay! Go and buy everything on my list. Sir, I want to buy something. Southern Song porcelain bowl from the Imperial Kilns. Southern Song? I can't tell! - A new forgery? - You're a pro! - All these for 30 yuan. - I'll take it. Sir, what did those two buy? A pile of ordinary stuff. You were after the box, weren't you? You're a fast learner. Single board Huanghuali wood. Here. The next item is a Song dynasty peacock and lotus flower bronze mirror. The diameter is 14 cm. Silver-polished high-tin bronze alloy. Exquisitely detailed. Cast from premium molds to maximize the silvery luster. It's starting at 40,000 yuan. He picked overlooked valuable pieces. Yes. He's either totally ignorant or an expert. Stop here. Folks, if you want treasures, look this way! Finally, do me one small favor. - Pick me. - What do you need? I'll do it. I can do it. Song dynasty, Imperial Kilns. It's old enough. Sir. How did you get these? Junyao red-splashed vase, Song dynasty. Starting at 50 yuan. Highest bidder wins. Are they all authentic? I never lie about that. Then why 50 yuan? - Do you smoke? - No. Sir. I'll take it for 500 yuan. No! Wait a moment. - I'll go home to get money. - You can take it. This gentleman has bid 50,000 yuan. It's 50,000, going once. It's 50,000, going twice. It's 50,000, three times. - Three times. - It's 500 yuan. It's 50,000, four times. Anyone else? Anyone else? This gentleman. - Hello? - Listen. A Ming dynasty Cizhou jar going for only 200 yuan starts at 10,000 yuan inside! - What? - Get out here quickly. It will sell out soon! Hurry! It's 65,000 yuan. Do we have 65,000 yuan? Folks, this item is russet-glazed tianqiuping. Starting bid, 80 yuan! - It's 150 yuan! - Okay, 150 yuan! Good, 150 yuan! - It's 260! - It's 260! Any more bids? - It's 300! - It's 300. Over there! - It's 400! - It's 400, once! Are you sure? Is it old enough? - Okay. - I'm coming right out. They're all genuine. Folks! Everyone! The auction isn't over. Don't go! You... It's 480! It's 500! It's 500, once! It's 500, twice! It's 500, three times! Sold! Everyone inside has come out. - Over there! - That's good. That's just what I want. You're dead meat to mess with Lord Shen. Are you selling it or not? Hurry up. I'm leaving even if you don't. Come on, man! Yes, I have more. Simmer down. Qing dynasty blue-and-white fish-tail design... - You're crazy. - Take a look. This also starts at 80 yuan. Slow down. I was asked to deliver this. It's a gift for Lord Shen. All the genuine items in Kui Market were picked out and sold cheaply. Even the auction was affected. Hurry up. They will all be sold out soon. - Hurry. - Come on. I must get my hands on some goods. It looks like the remaining items will be bought-in. Is this your doing? Unlike the others out there, I'm not stupid enough to mess with Lord Shen. I'm here to limit the damage. Sorry, folks. Today's auction is over. Please leave the premises. Thank you. - Any more goods? - Do you have more? Yes! Calm down! Blue and white vase with cover. Quiet! Quiet! Come on. Lord Shen wants to see you. What took you so long? Here is 50,000 yuan in cash plus the treasures I chose for Lord Shen. If Lord Shen is willing to accept this, this will cover any losses. Yao Buran bought the bronze mirror. Let him have it. You dare mess with us? When you take off that chain, is your neck stained green? The kid in the photos is so cute. He can't be yours. Isn't that right, Lord Shen? It has been a while since we've been so busy here. So you are the troublemaker. Have some fruit. Thank you, Lord Shen. I knew it would offend you. But if I didn't do this, you would never agree to see me. And I would never get that bronze mirror. You want my things but won't follow my rules. Neither did Yao Buran. Money is the rule. I'm guessing that your mirror is part of a nested set. One piece can fit inside the other. The genuine outer piece was auctioned off. But the fake inner piece? I bet it is still with you. Take it. It's fake anyway. All right. I ruined your auction today. I wish to compensate you. You're good with calculations. So do the math. What will I do next? Xu Yuan! Messing with my business is the ultimate insult to me. Xu Yuan! Xu Yuan! Hello? Junjun, finish your homework and then you may watch cartoons. I will bring you back a treat. Be good and do your homework. Bye. Stop! Lord Shen. I'll give you this as an apology. The bronze dragon ring from the Five's Yellow House? Who is Huang Kewu to you? Which of those two won this round? As you had expected, they are currently even. Do as I say. You could have just given it to him. Why bother hurting him? When you first gave me the mirror, you wanted me to make some money for you. Then you brought those two to mess with my business. But let me tell you. Lao Chaofeng has eyes on the boy. If you continue hanging out with them, you'll be the next one in trouble. CONSULTING ROOM INJECTION ROOM You're awake. You're a hardy one. Where's my mirror? Here. Where's the cloth? Fu Gui was here. Fu Gui was here? The old crook. I'll go find him. Wait. Move aside. Get me a train ticket for this afternoon. I'm going to my hometown. SOUTH STATION The train is arriving. Passengers for... Xu Yuan is heading here. I've checked. That is the only entrance to the station. Excuse me. Let's split up. I'll go that way. You old crook! I'm going back home. - Where is my stuff? - Here. Get out of my sight. Out of the way! - Move! - Out of the way! You two, chase him! You three, come with me! Move out of the way! Excuse me. He can't do that! Excuse me. This train is heading to... Excuse me. Look. Attention, passengers. The train will depart shortly. This is the last call. Please board from Platform Two. Do you want this? I'll trade you for the mirror. You've finally come around. And I thought you were so clever. Give it a rest. Without my half, you can't solve it either. Fine. Hurry! Intercept him there! Hurry! - Where is the mirror? - Here. Are you okay? This way! Get out of the way! Didn't you say it was useless? I was wrong. Both mirrors are useful. Where is the satin cloth? Yao Buran has it. But I still have the clue. The mirror is needed to solve the words on the cloth. You are so clever. Let's buy our tickets. Buran, you have both clues now. What is your plan? Mr. Du. I think we'll be going on a long trip. Okay. Ace. Excuse us. Two. Two. Then... I've got nothing. Pass. Don't pass. Four of a kind. Look who it is! Take over while I go to the restroom. Stop there. Where are you going? The restroom is that way. I can't seem to get rid of you! This is my train! You're still lying. You stole from us at the hospital. What do you want now? Yes, beat me! Just kill me then! You have some nerves. Drop the act! - Why did you hit him? - He's a thief! You're really into it. - What's going on? - None of your business! This is our family's business. Just a son hitting his dad. - You hit your dad? - Stay out of it. - He's not my dad! - I'm not good enough to be your dad. Stop. Listen to this old woman. What kind of daughter-in-law are you? Tell him to stop. No, you're mistaken. We look nothing alike! What other tricks do you have? You've always known Lord Shen. We're good friends. You set up a trap for me. A misunderstanding. You're playing me for a fool. I'm the fool. Are you with Lao Chaofeng? Mortal enemies. Kid, to tell you the truth, your dad came to me and told me to protect you. Only after he died did I ponder over it. What does it mean to protect you? It means to keep you out of this matter. Yes, I traded the mirror for some money. It was money for you. We're on the same team. Why are you two holding hands? Get off me. Let's talk over there. I copied the text in the photo to scale. Then I used stone rubbing to retrieve the text on the back of the mirror shards. Putting them together shows us the complete clue. It's Lesser Seal font. "North of River Luo." That should be the city of Luo. "East of Jiudou." Luo's largest antique street is called Jiudou Street. This character is unclear. A piece is missing from the mirror. We need to think about it. "Crouching Tiger at..." At what? At... What could it be? The Imperial Temple Hall is in Luo. Would Xu Heping have put the real Buddha head there? Let's transfer to Luo at the next stop. Okay. Keep this safe. When someone comes looking for you, give it to him. I... That someone will be my son. If anything happens to me, protect him for me. Folks, let passengers disembark first. Please make way. Let passengers disembark first. Please make way. You two! You two! You two. Why are you following us? I never believed that Mr. Xu gave away the real head. When your grandpa was executed, I was right there. I never believed that he was a traitor. You're just after the Buddha head. I've never lied to you. - This time, I really... - Ignore him. Let's go. The last line is, "Crouching tiger at Zheng." Tiger Zheng of Zheng Clan Village. I know him. Dead? Mr. Zheng Senior died a week ago. This is another of your traps, isn't it? Plan B. His son, Zheng Guoqu, will do too. Mr. Zheng Junior said that if anyone seeks Mr. Zheng Senior, tell them to put a coin in the Dragon Toad's mouth and wait. So this is what he meant. I have a coin here. We should be more presentable for our first meeting with him. How? You said that you saved money for me. Pay up. Your grandpa and Tiger Zheng were captured by Japanese agents. And I, armed with a pistol in each hand and a light machine gun, rescued them. Enough. Do you think you're a superhero? Are you done shopping yet? I feel like you're fleecing me. I don't mind the cost, but I feel laborers should dress simply. You dress up too. - Me too? - Come on. Yes. Don't you know Zheng Guoqu? You're the star of the show. You must pay me back for this. Let's go. Is it okay to leave him like this? He should never have been involved. It looks great, but it's just too expensive. Look around some more. This color is nice. This one. It's gone. Are you the ones who wish to see Mr. Zheng? Where are we going? Big shots. Lao Chaofeng's people want to talk business with our village. Last year, you people took 70% of our business. And you dare to come? We wish to pay our respects to Mr. Zheng Senior. Lao Chaofeng said that future profits shall be split evenly. We should be the ones to take the final step. The old master has returned! I thought you were so smart. Pretending to be with Lao Chaofeng is asking to be killed. What was I to say? Antiques Police? Do you have other ideas? Just stay alive. Tell me what you think of our technique. You've produced a high volume. You said that you're with Lao Chaofeng. So is he. Why didn't you tell us you were here? I came to welcome you. Mr. Zheng, we're buddies. Why didn't you come together? A little friendly competition is normal. Who wouldn't want to connect with you first? A little something to show my respect. Seikado black-glazed Jianyao Tenmuku bowl. And you? Hurry, bring out our gift. Wonderful! This gift can bear young! It's a good gift that can bear young! Grandma. Yes. I am the gift. Will I do? Yes! Grandma is hungry. Let's go eat. She can bear young! She can bear young! It's good. What does he mean? Does he not like me? Isn't that good though? Button up. A cold would be bad for your fertility. - Grandma. - Button up. A cold would be bad for your fertility. Button up. She's not your wife, right? No. She's my biological sister. Serve dinner! This is called Eight Cuts Execution. Cutting it like this makes it delicious. A stab in the back! Hack open the shoulder! My dad used to tell me the penalty for deceiving the emperor was this. The decapitated head is paraded around! A while back, someone came to see my dad. He gave my dad a Lao Chaofeng coin. As soon as he left, my dad died. You say that you're with Lao Chaofeng. Do you know that person? If not, why should I spare you? - Don't move. - Don't move. We have guests! What is he doing here? You had a contingency plan. Welcome, Mr. Fu. We've been waiting for you. Dad always used to mention you. Now I finally meet you. This way. What is with all this cutlery? I had to handle something. What took you so long? Do you know each other? Yes. Not only that. This is my son. Dad. Doesn't he work for Lao Chaofeng? Yes. Let me at him. You rotten brat. You spend my money but disobey me! - Sorry, Dad. - What now? Dad. Please don't hit him. You should've watched over your brother. He has gone astray. Sorry, Dad. I'm also working for Lao Chaofeng. Dad. Don't be upset. Please sit down. Come. Sit, Dad. You should manage your husband. Isn't she your sister? Our family is a bit complicated. How dare you keep acting! Kill them! You're still acting! Stop! Do you think I'm that stupid? Lie and none of you will survive the day! - It's 100 million. - What 100 million? The Imperial Temple Hall Buddha head. It's 100 million. It's 100 million for the Buddha head. The Japanese have a fake head. Xu Heping had the real one. Xu Heping went to see your dad. Why should I believe you? We followed the clues here. Xu Heping must have left other clues. Look at this mirror. Did your dad make it? Without us, you can't solve it either. When we find the Buddha head, how we divvy up the reward will be up to you. One hundred million is good! One hundred million can bear young! One hundred million is good! One hundred million can bear young! We have a dowry now! Mr. Fu, how hot-headed of me. Let's eat! - Cheers! - Bottoms up! Why did you come here? If I hadn't come, you would be dead. If you guys hadn't come, I would've already solved it. Right back at you. Stop blathering and think of a plan. He's coming. Mr. Fu brought you all to our village to celebrate Lunar New Year. We were in the wrong just now. Let's apologize to them, all right? You're too kind. I'll tell the truth. My dad did go to the back hills with Xu Heping. Tomorrow, I'll bring you there. But tonight, we'll eat with Grandma and celebrate the New Year, all right? - Sure. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's drink. I don't care if you meant to give this gift. I accept. I like you. Be mine and all the treasures in the back hills will be yours. Aren't you going a bit too fast? Do you like her too? I definitely like her. But what's the use? What? Look at Guoqu. This is his sincerity. Besides, I'm a great catch. Who wouldn't like me, right? I've always liked you. Whoever drinks the most can have me! Okay! Since we're already a family, let's take a picture together. Yes! A family portrait! - Let's do it. - Let's take a family portrait! She is such a pretty thing! - Come! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Come on! Come on here. Smile. Three, two, one! Okay! Guoqu, let's go and toast the villagers. - Come on. - Okay, let's go. - Come. - Fill it up. Cheers! Are you already out of breath? You are so weak. You took your sweet time. Don't you think we got the keys too easily? We have to jump in even if it's a trap. Twelve caves. Twelve keys. There's not enough time. I have an idea. Let's team up for once. Six each. You take the farthest ones. Let's see how fast you are. What does it mean? What are you doing? Arranging them in order. Twelve treasure caves containing real and fake items. The same occurred at Xu Heping's home. Do you think it could be Morse code again? Xu Heping wouldn't play the same game twice. Could it be the twelve Earthly Branches? Do you want another match? It's a game of Go. This is one-twelfth of it. Genuine items are black stones and fakes are white stones. The 12 caves arranged in order of the Earthly Branches form a game of Go. It's the 1993 China-Japan match between Wu Qingyuan and Honinbo Shusai. It was famous for its "3-3, star, and center" opening. The match lasted three months with 13 adjournments. Wu Qingyuan alone played against the entire Honinbo house. There was a certain move that the house worked on for three days. That was also the decisive move. That move was at W160. Soaring Span. Although Wu Qingyuan lost in the end, he still played a brilliant move at B161. It blocked Honinbo Shusai's Soaring Span. B161. Fighting for Life. This move was Wu Qingyuan's best defense. Guoqu, you've had too much. Look, you've had too much to drink. Let's go lie down inside. Come on. You've had too much. How was my performance? What do you mean, Guoqu? You're drunk. You're drunk. - I'm drunk? - You're drunk. I've been drinking since I was five. Ask them. Who can out-drink me? All right, Zheng Guoqu. I've underestimated you. Your two brothers are so calculating. If I didn't act like this, they wouldn't solve the puzzle for me. They should be almost done by now. Watch her. THE FIVE PLANETS AND TWENTY-EIGHT CONSTELLATIONS "The Five Planets and Twenty-Eight Constellations." Everybody! Time to do some culling! Outsiders have arrived! Be alert! Who are these guys now? They keep arriving on a silver platter. Protect Grandma. Kill them! Go! This painting is fake. Only a Tang dynasty rubbing exists of Zhang Sengyao's painting. Both had been purchased by Fusajiro Abe. This is fake and incomplete. It only has the Tail, Winnowing Basket, and Dipper Mansions. I'll lock the door for you. Don't open it to anyone, okay? Stay. Bring me that box down there. That one. This one? His dad left it. It's your betrothal gift. No, Grandma. Grandma! Grandma! Tiger! What happened to you? Grandma. The Tail and Winnowing Basket are in the Eastern Azure Dragon. The Dipper, the Northern Black Tortoise. Northeast. That's the direction. I knew I could count on you. FUSHAN Is everything okay? Just fine. Only this temple is in the northeast. JI GONG TEMPLE Go in. A Goddess of Mercy statue in a Ji Gong Temple? Sir! Is Grandma safe? Yes, she's fine. Don't worry, sir. If I had brought weapons to the party, all of your guys would be dead. I told you. Those aren't our guys. It's a chart of the Twenty-Eight Mansions. I am sure this is it. Something is missing here. I knew this revolving vase would come in handy. Dad left it for me. Open it. Zhang Sengyao's painting. Tail, Winnowing Basket, and Dipper Mansions. TAIL MANSION WINNOWING BASKET MANSION DIPPER MANSION Go down. Open the door. This tomb has been robbed. Let's go. Back then, Xue Huaiyi, Wu Zetian's favored subject, furious from falling out of favor, burned down the Imperial Temple Hall. Wu Zetian later executed him in front of Yaoguang Hall. Legend says that he moved all the treasures out before he burned down the hall. And the Buddha head was among them. Found it. The Buddha head! It really exists! One hundred million yuan! One hundred million! I'll go get it! Shut up! Calm down. You guys, go and bring it to me! Clockwise curls. Crown hand-polished with jade-grinding sand. The dull glow of Tang dynasty jade. The same face as the Vairocana at Longmen Grottoes. It's Wu Zetian's face. The Imperial Temple Hall Bodhisattva Head has always been here. Bring it here! This layout called Tiger's Mouth is a trap. I can't. - Do it! - It's a trap. Give it to him! Give it to him. We're dead either way. Give it to him. Didn't you say that it's a trap? Are you all right? You brought men? They brought me here. Go. You're with Lao Chaofeng. I'm not with anyone. I just want the Buddha head. You played both sides. You got a good look at the antique world. Plum Blossom Five or Lao Chaofeng, they're all the same. I am here to put an end to all this. Go! Get up! Xu Yuan! Get up. Come help! Quick! Come on! Hurry. And I, armed with a pistol in each hand, shot down over 30 of their guys and rescued them. What's the matter? Let's go. Is everyone okay? Yes. This. Here! Here. My dad left me a way out. In Go, it's called atari. When three stones touch, the situation is unlocked. Right here. Dig. What are you doing? Come here. Get over here and help out. Let me rest for a bit. Okay, good. Here. I promised your dad to protect you. I have done it. What did I say at the time? A pistol in each hand and a light machine gun. Actually, as soon as you entered the bathhouse, I recognized you. You look just like your dad. And you're just as stubborn as he was. I just don't get it. - What's wrong with being an ordinary man - Okay. With a fondness for money and women? All right, let's go. Come on. When I was young, no bullets could hit me. I'll carry you out. I can't go. Come on. I can't go. Don't get involved with the Buddha head anymore. You're the last of your family. Xu Yuan. I'm here. I need to tell you something. Tell me. Didn't I try to keep you away? Your dad came to me and told me to protect you. This is my son. Dad. What does it mean to protect you? It means to keep you out of this matter. We're on the same team. It's caving in. Let's go! Grandpa. You did well this time. Back then, when Xu Yicheng found the Buddha head, I asked him to give it to me. But Xu Yicheng would rather be executed as a traitor than tell me where the real head was. In the end, the winner of this match is our Yao clan. It's not over yet. I'm just getting started. He's dead. The Buddha head is gone. We're just hours away from the handover. We followed Xu Heping's clues here. Why would he lead us here, but also warn me that it's a trap? A Goddess of Mercy statue in a Ji Gong Temple? This hand posture is that of a Dharmakaya Bodhisattva. But the head is of a Maitreya Bodhisattva. Zhang Sengyao's star chart. The mirror is part of a nested set. "Yin is within Yang, not opposing Yang." Mr. Liu. Ms. Kido. He is here. We can start now. All right. Let's begin. Ladies and gentlemen, the handover of Wu Zetian's Imperial Temple Hall Bodhisattva Head will now begin. LIU YIMING, HUANG KEWU, KANA KIDO I now present one of the descendants of the Plum Blossom Five, Mr. Yao Buran. His grandpa, Yao Lai, together with Mr. Xu Yicheng, discovered the Buddha head. Therefore, on behalf of the Plum Blossom Five, he will sign the certificate of receipt for the Buddha head. I cannot accept this Buddha head. What? How could this happen? - What's going on? - Is he serious? At the crown of this head is an area polished not with jade-grinding sand, but with very similar quartz sand and river sand. So there are many triangular divots. They look very much like erosion marks. This is a flaw that can be extremely easily overlooked. As for why Mr. Xu Yicheng gave away this Buddha head back then, I am in no position to comment. I will just say this. We found an identical Buddha head at Conch Mountain. It is even superior in both quality and appearance. Therefore, this Buddha head is the real Bodhisattva head from Wu Zetian's Imperial Temple Hall. As for the flaws on that head at the fore, I had mentioned them to Mr. Huang before. But he ignored them. This is the transaction record of the antique dealers. It's evidence collected over the years by the Yao family. All the fakes listed inside have been certified by Plum Blossom Five. We, the Plum Blossom Five, never certify fake pieces. Whether you admit it or not, the Five under your leadership has violated its motto, "Ridding the fake, preserving the real." Do you think you are still qualified to be chairman? You must have waited a long time for this day. Back then, we Yaos found the Buddha head. Now, we Yaos have found it again. If you're unable to lead the Plum Blossom Five, then the position should belong to the Yao family. Can you please explain? How was this Buddha head found? Please tell us about that. Yao Buran! I am a descendant of the Xu family. I am the one that Ms. Kido requested. I thought you didn't care about this ceremony. I'm here to take back what belongs to the Xu family. It's all over. The head you brought isn't the right one. It is indeed from the Tang dynasty. But it is a decoy that Xue Huaiyi set up. It's a Sambhogakaya Bodhisattva head on Dharmakaya Bodhisattva body. You even failed to notice that. The Buddha head is the truth. It is right here. What do you have? I have one too. Xu Yuan. You say you have a Buddha head. Bring it out. Wait. I'll definitely prove it to you. I know where the head is. We have no time to mess around with you. Security! Get him out of here! Come! Let go of me. Mr. Liu, wait a bit longer! Put the Buddha head away. Don't take it away! The handover ceremony is on hold. I really know where it is, Mr. Liu! It's here! You're a little late. Do you really have another Buddha head? My dad didn't put the real Buddha head inside the tomb. Back then, my grandpa, Xu Yicheng, discovered this Buddha head. The Japanese and Lao Chaofeng both wanted it. Grandpa thought of a way to protect this Buddha head. My dad, Xu Heping, discovered this secret. However, to keep the head from falling into Lao Chaofeng's hands, he changed his identity and remained in hiding for 20 years. Now, he has told me the answer. Zhang Sengyao's painting, the Goddess of Mercy statue at Ji Gong Temple, and the yin-yang nested mirrors all point to one clue. One truth. It is that the monk Baozhi of the Northern and Southern dynasties was the original Ji Gong. According to historical records, Emperor Wu of Liang ordered Zhang Sengyao to paint Baozhi's portrait. In front of the emperor, Baozhi took a knife and cut open his own face and revealed his true appearance. This truth was... The truth was under his skin! The real is within the fake! This is the secret that the Xu family has kept for 50 years. Wu Zetian's Imperial Temple Hall Jade Maitreya Bodhisattva statue. Xu Yuan, by the time you read this letter, I believe you will have solved all the riddles. Your grandpa's generation faced Japanese enemies and domestic bandits. As big as China was, it was no place for an intact artifact. XU YICHENG, 1909-1942 In order to keep the Buddha head from the Japanese and Lao Chaofeng, your grandpa was left with this desperate measure. Let the Japanese believe that the head is real. Let Lao Chaofeng believe that the head is fake. Wait for the day when Yuzo Kido returns the Buddha head. Meanwhile, I could only go into hiding to fulfill your grandpa's dying wish. All these years, I've been trying to find a chance to apologize to you. But I didn't dare go to see you. I don't want you to take on my burden. And I am afraid of disturbing the simple and quiet life that you worked so hard to lead. For these 20 years, I wondered every day. What do you look like now? Have you grown taller? Do you laugh more often now? Do you still remember what I look like? Do you still hate me? I am not a good dad. I don't dare hope you will forgive me. Ultimately, this was the only way I could show you the secret our clan has kept all these years. I sorely miss the days of playing Go with you in my arms. That was the happiest time of my life. You have won this match. AUTHORITIES CRACKED DOWN ON CRIME IN THE ANTIQUES SECTOR. THANKS TO HELP FROM XU YUAN ZHENG GUOQU, YAO LAI, AND LORD SHEN WERE PUNISHED BY THE LAW. FOUR PENITENCES China's electronics industry mourns the loss of a fix-it guy. You couldn't even handle a Buddha head. I'm leading the way for the antique world. What's this? I went to the police station. Fu Gui's body has been taken care of. Mr. Du and Yao Buran have vanished. Currently, evidence indicates that Lao Chaofeng is likely... It's no longer important. It's all over.
