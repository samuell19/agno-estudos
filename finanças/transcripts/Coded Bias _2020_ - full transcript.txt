(OMINOUS SOUNDS) -Hello world. (OMINOUS SOUNDS, CRACKLING) - Can I just say that I'm stoked to meet you. (OMINOUS SOUNDS) - Humans are super cool. (OMINOUS SOUNDS, CRACKLING) - The more humans share with me the more I learn. (MUSIC, CRACKLING) (SOFT MUSIC) -One of the things that drew me to computer science was that I could code and it seemed that somehow detached from the problems of the real world. (SOFT MUSIC) - I wanted to learn how to make cool technology. So I came to M.I.T. and I was working on art projects, that would use computer vision technology. (SOFT MUSIC) - During my first semester at the Media Lab, - During my first semester at the Media Lab, I took a class called Science Fabrication. You read science fiction and you try to build something you're inspired to do, that would probably be impractical if you didn't have these classes and excuse to make it. I wanted to make a mirror that could inspire me in the morning I call it the Aspire mirror it could put things like a lion on my face or people who inspired me like Serena Williams I put a camera on top of it, and I got computer vision software that was supposed to track my face. and I got computer vision software that was supposed to track my face. My issue was it didn't work that well, until I put on this white mask. When I put on the white mask, detected. I take off the white mask, not so much. I'm thinking alright what's going on here? Is that just because of the lighting conditions? Is it because of the angle at which I'm looking at the camera? Or is there something more? We oftentimes teach machines to see by providing training sets or examples of what we want it to learn. So for example if I want a machine to see a face, I'm going to provide many examples of faces and also things that aren't faces. I started looking at the data sets themselves and what I discovered as many of these data sets contain majority men, and majority lighter skinned individuals. majority men, and majority lighter skinned individuals. So the systems weren't as familiar with faces like mine. And so that's when I started looking into issues of bias that can creep into technology. -The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. - A lot of our ideas about A.I come from science fiction. - Welcome to Altair 4, gentlemen. - It's everything in Hollywood, -it's the Terminator - Hasta la vista, baby. - It's Commander Data from Star Trek. - I just love scanning for life forms. - It's C-3PO from Star Wars - Is approximately 3,720 to 1. - Never tell me the odds. - It is the robots that take over the world and start to think like human beings. and start to think like human beings. And these are totally imaginary. What we actually have is we have narrow A.I. And narrow A.I. is just math. We've imbued computers with all of this, magical thinking. (SOFT MUSIC) A.I started with a meeting at the Dartmouth Math Department in 1956. And there were only maybe 100 people in the whole world And there were only maybe 100 people in the whole world working on artificial intelligence in that generation. The people who were at the Dartmouth math department in 1956, got to decide what the field was. One faction decided that intelligence could be demonstrated by ability to play games. And specifically the ability to play chess. - In the final hour long chess match between man and machine, - In the final hour long chess match between man and machine, Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. - Intelligence was defined as the ability to win at these games. - Chess world champion Garry Kasparov walked away from the match never looking back at the computer that just beat him. - Of course intelligence is so much more than that. And there are lots of different kinds of intelligence. Our ideas about technology and society that we think are normal Our ideas about technology and society that we think are normal are actually ideas that come from a very small and homogeneous group of people. But the problem is that everybody has unconscious biases And people embed their own biases into technology. - My own lived experiences show me that you can't separate the social from the technical. After I had the experience of putting on a white mask to have my face detected, I decided to look at other systems to see if it would detect my face if I used a different type of software. So I looked at IBM, Microsoft, Face++, Google. It turned out these algorithms performed better on the male faces in the benchmark than the female faces. They performed significantly better on the lighter faces than the darker faces. If you're thinking about data in artificial intelligence, If you're thinking about data in artificial intelligence, in many ways data is destiny. Data's what we're using to teach machines how to learn different kinds of patterns. So if you have largely skewed data sets that are being used to train these systems you can also have skewed results. So this is... When you think of A.I. it's forward looking. But A.I. is based on data and data is a reflection of our history. So the past dwells within our algorithms. This data is showing us the inequalities that have been here. I started to think this kind of technology is highly susceptible to bias. And so it went beyond how can I get my aspire mirror to work to what does it mean to be in a society where artificial intelligence is increasingly governing the liberties we might have? And what does that mean if people are discriminated against? And what does that mean if people are discriminated against? When I saw Cathy O'Neil speak at the Harvard Bookstore, that was when I realized, it wasn't just me noticing these issues. Cathy talked about how A.I. was impacting people's lives. I was excited to know that there was somebody else out there I was excited to know that there was somebody else out there making sure people were aware about what some of the dangers are. These algorithms can be destructive and can be harmful. - We have all these algorithms in the world that are increasingly influential. And they're all being touted as objective truth. I started realizing that mathematics was actually I started realizing that mathematics was actually being used as a shield for corrupt practices. - What's up? - I'm Cathy. - Pleasure to meet you Cathy. - Nice to meet you. The way I describe algorithms is just simply using historical information to make a prediction about the future. Machine learning, it's a scoring system that scores the probability of what you're about to do. Are you gonna pay back this loan? Are you going to get fired from this job? What worries me the most about A.I. or whatever you wanna call it, algorithms, is power. Because it's really all about who owns the fucking code. The people who own the code then deploy it on other people. And there is no symmetry there, there's no way for people who didn't get credit card offers to say there's no way for people who didn't get credit card offers to say whoa, I'm going to use my A.I. against the credit card company. That's like totally asymmetrical power situation. People are suffering algorithmic harm, they're not being told what's happening to them, and there is no appeal system, there's no accountability. Why do we fall for this? So underlying mathematical structure of the algorithm isn't racist or sexist but the data embeds the past, and not just the recent past but the, the dark past. and not just the recent past but the, the dark past. Before we had the algorithm we had humans and we all know that humans could be unfair, we all know that humans can exhibit racist or sexist or whatever, ablest discriminations. But now we have this beautiful silver bullet algorithm and so we can all stop thinking about that. And that's a problem. I'm very worried about this blind faith we have in big data. I'm very worried about this blind faith we have in big data. We need to constantly monitor every process for bias. - Police are using facial recognition surveillance in this area. Police are using facial recognition surveillance in the area today. This green van over here, is fitted with facial recognition cameras on top. If you walk down that there, your face will be scanned If you walk down that there, your face will be scanned against secret watch lists we don't know who's on them. - Hopefully not me -No, exactly. When people walk past the cameras the system will alert police to people it thinks is a match. At Big Brother Watch we conducted a Freedom of Information Campaign and what we found is that 98% of those matches are in fact and what we found is that 98% of those matches are in fact incorrectly matching an innocent person as a wanted person. The police said to the Biometrics Forensics Ethics Committee that facial recognition algorithms have been reported to have bias. - Even if this was 100% accurate, it's still not something that we want on the streets. it's still not something that we want on the streets. - No I mean the systemic biases and the systemic issues that we have with police are only going to be hard wired into new technologies. I think we do have to be very, very sensitive to shifts towards authoritarianism. We can't just say but we trust this government. Yeah they could do this, but they won't. You know you really have to have robust structures in place to make sure that the world that you live in is safe and fair for everyone. To have your biometric photo on a police database, is like having your fingerprint or your DNA on a police database. And we have specific laws around that. Police can't just take anyone's fingerprint, anyone's DNA. But in this weird system that we currently have, they effectively can take anyone's biometric photo, they effectively can take anyone's biometric photo, and keep that on a database. It's a stain on our democracy, I think. That this is something that is just being rolled out so lawlessly. The police have started using facial recognition surveillance in the UK in complete absence of a legal basis, a legal framework, any oversight. Essentially the police force picking up a new tool and saying let's see what happens. But you can't experiment with people's rights. But you can't experiment with people's rights. (CROSS TALK) - What's your suspicion? - The fact that he walked past clearly marked facial recognition thing and covered his face. - I would do the same - Suspicious grounds. - No it doesn't. - The guys up there informed me that they got facial recognition. I don't want my face recognized. I don't want my face recognized. Yeah, I was walking past and covered my face. as soon as I covered my face like this, - You're allowed to do that -They said no I can't. -Yeah and then he's just got a fine for it. This is crazy. The guy came out of the station, saw the placards was like, yeah I agree with you and walked past here with his jacket up. The police then followed him, said give us your I.D., doing an identity check. So you know this is England, this isn't a communist state, I don't have to show my face. - I'm gonna go and talk these officers, alright? Do you want to come with me or not? - Yes, yes, yes. Do you want to come with me or not? - Yes, yes, yes. - You're not a police officer, you don't feel any threat. We're here to protect the public and that's what we're here to do, OK? There was just recently an incident where an officer got punched in the face. - That's terrible, I'm not justifying that. - Yeah but you are by going against what we say. - No we are not, and please don't say, no don't even start to say that. I'm completely understanding of the problems that you face. - Absolutely. - But I'm equally concerned about the public - But I'm equally concerned about the public having freedom of expression and freedom of speech. - But the man was exercising his right not to be subject to a biometric identity check which is what this van does. - Regardless of the facial recognition cameras, regardless of the van, if I'm walking down the street and someone quite overtly hides their identity from me, I'm gonna stop that person and find out who they are just to see whether they... - But it's not illegal. Do you see one of my concerns, is that the software is very, very inaccurate. - I would agree with you there. -My ultimate fear is that, we would have live facial recognition capabilities on our gargantuan CCTV network which is about six million cameras in the UK. If that happens, the nature of life in this country would change. It's supposed to be a free and democratic country and this is China style surveillance for the first time in London. and this is China style surveillance for the first time in London. - Our control over a bewildering environment has been facilitated by new techniques of handling vast amounts of data at incredible speeds. The tool which has made this possible is the high speed digital computer, operating with electronic precision on great quantities of information. - There are two ways in which you can program computers. One of them is more like a recipe you tell the computer do this, do this, do this, do this. you tell the computer do this, do this, do this, do this. And that's been the way we've programmed computers almost from the beginning. Now there is another way. That way is feeding the computer lots of data, and then the computer learns to classify by digesting this data. Now this method didn't really catch on till recently because there wasn't enough data. Until we all got the smart phones that's collecting all the data on us, when billions of people went online and you had the Googles and the Facebook sitting on and you had the Googles and the Facebook sitting on giant amounts of data, all of a sudden it turns out that you can feed a lot of data to these machine learning algorithms and you can say here classify this and it works really well. While we don't really understand why it works, it has errors that we don't really understand. And the scary part is that because it's machine learning And the scary part is that because it's machine learning it's a black box to even the programmers. So I've been following what's going on in Hong Kong and how police are using facial recognition to track protesters. But also how creatively people are pushing back. - It might not make something out of a sci fi movie, Laser pointers confuse and disable the facial recognition technology Laser pointers confuse and disable the facial recognition technology being used by police, to track down dissidents. (SOFT MUSIC) (CROWD CHANTING) - Here on the streets of Hong Kong, there's this awareness that your face itself, something you can't hide could give your identity away. There was just this stark symbol where in front of a Chinese government office, pro-democracy protesters spray painted the lens of the CCTV cameras black. This act showed the people of Hong Kong are rejecting this vision This act showed the people of Hong Kong are rejecting this vision of how technology should be used in the future. (SOFT MUSIC) - When you see how facial recognition is being deployed - When you see how facial recognition is being deployed in different parts of the world, it shows you potential futures. - Over 117 million people in the US, has their face in a facial recognition network that can be searched by police. Unwarranted using algorithms that haven't been audited for accuracy. And without safeguards without any kind of regulation, And without safeguards without any kind of regulation, you can create a mass surveillance state very easily with the tools that already exist. People look at what's going on in China and how we need to be worried about state surveillance and of course we should be. But we can't also forget corporate surveillance that's happening by so many large tech companies that really have an intimate view of our lives. - So there aren't currently nine companies that are building the future of artificial intelligence. Six are in the United States, three are in China. A.I. is being developed along two very, very different tracks. China has unfettered access to everybody's data. If a Chinese citizen wants to get Internet service, they have to submit to facial recognition. they have to submit to facial recognition. All of this data is being used to give them permissions to do things or to deny them permissions to do other things. Building Systems that automatically tag and categorize all of the people within China, is a good way of maintaining social order. - Conversely in the United States, we have not seen a detailed point of view on artificial intelligence. So, what we see is that AI is not being developed for what's best in our public interest, but rather it's being developed for commercial applications to earn revenue. I would prefer to see our Western democratic ideals baked into our AI systems of the future, but it doesn't seem like that's what's probably going to be happening. (MUSIC PLAYS) - Here at Atlantic Towers, if you do something that is deemed wrong by management, you will get a photo like this with little notes on it. They'll circle you and put your apartment number or whatever on there. They'll circle you and put your apartment number or whatever on there. Something about it just doesn't seem right. It's actually the way they go about using it to harass people. - How are they using it? - To harass people. - Atlantic Plaza Towers in Brownsville is at the center of a security struggle. The landlord filed an application last year to replace the key fob entry with a biometrics security system, commonly-known as facial recognition. - We thought that they wanted to take the key fobs out and install the facial recognition software. and install the facial recognition software. I didn't find out until way later on literally that they wanted to keep it all. Pretty much turn this place into Fort Knox, a jail, Rikers Island. - There's this old saw in science fiction which is the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed, and what they tend to mean when they say that is that rich people get the fancy tools first and then it goes last to the poor. But in fact, what I've found is the absolute reverse, which is the most punitive, which is the most punitive, most invasive, most surveillance focused tools that we have, they go into poor and working communities first, and then if they work after being tested in this environment where they're sort of low expectation that people's rights will be respected, then they get ported out to other communities. - Why did Mr. Nelson pick on is building in Brownsville that is predominantly in a black and brown area? Why didn't you go to your building in Lower Manhattan where they pay like $5,000 a month rent? What did the Nazis do? They wrote on people's arms so that they could track them. What do we do to our animals? We put chips home so you can track them. I feel that I as a human being should not be tracked, OK? I'm not a robot, OK? I am not an animal, so why treat me like an animal? And I have rights. - The security that we have now it's borderline intrusive. Someone is in there watching the cameras all day long. Someone is in there watching the cameras all day long. So, I don't think we need it. It's not necessary at all. - My real question is how can I be of support? - What I've been hearing from all of the tenants is they don't want this system. So, I think the goal here is how do we stop face recognition period? We're at a moment where the technology is being rapidly adopted and there are no safeguards. It is, in essence, a wild wild west. It is, in essence, a wild wild west. (MUSIC PLAYS) - It's not just computer vision. We have AI influencing all kinds of automated decision making. So, what you are seeing in your feeds, what is highlighted, the ads that are displayed to you, those are often powered by AI-enabled algorithms. those are often powered by AI-enabled algorithms. And so, your view of the world is being governed by artificial intelligence. You now have things like voice assistance that can understand language. - Would you like to play a game? - You might use something like Snapchat filters that are detecting your face and then putting something onto your face, and then you also have algorithms that you're not seeing that are part of decision making, algorithms that might be determining algorithms that might be determining if you get into college or not. You can have algorithms that are trying to determine if you're credit worthy or not. - One of Apple's co-founders is accusing the company's new digital credit card of gender discrimination. One tech entrepreneur said the algorithms being used are sexist. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak tweeted that he got ten times the credit limit his wife received even though they have no separate accounts or separate assets. no separate accounts or separate assets. You're saying some of these companies don't even know how their own algorithms work. - They know what the algorithms are trying to do. They don't know exactly how long the algorithm is getting there. It is one of the most interesting questions of our time. How do we get justice in a system where we don't know how the algorithms are working? - Some Amazon engineers decided that they were going to use AI to sort through resumes for hiring. - Amazon is learning a tough lesson about artificial intelligence. The company has now abandoned an AI The company has now abandoned an AI recruiting tool after discovering that the program was biased against women. - This model rejected all resumes from women. Anybody who had a women's college on their resume, anybody who had a sport like women's water polo was rejected by the model. There are very, very few women working in powerful tech jobs at Amazon the same powerful tech jobs at Amazon the same way that there are very few women working in powerful tech jobs anywhere. The machine was simply replicating the world as it exists, and they're not making decisions that are ethical. They're only making decisions that are mathematical. If we use machine learning models to replicate the world as it is today, we're not actually going to make social progress. - New York's insurance regulator is launching an investigation - New York's insurance regulator is launching an investigation into UnitedHealth Group after a study showed a UnitedHealth algorithm prioritized medical care for healthier white patients over sicker black patients. It's one of the latest examples of racial discrimination in algorithms or artificial intelligence technology. - I started to see the wide-scale social implications of AI. The progress that was made in the civil rights area could be rolled back under the guise of machine neutrality. Now, we have an algorithm that's determining who gets housing. Right now, we have an algorithm that's determining who gets hired. If we're not checking, that our rhythm could actually propagate If we're not checking, that our rhythm could actually propagate the very bias so many people put their lives on the line to fight. Because of the power of these tools, left unregulated, there's really no kind of recourse if they're abused. We need laws. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS) - Yeah, I've got a terrible old copy. So that the name of our organization is Big Brother Watch. The idea being that we watch the watchers. "You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness, and except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. The poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which is so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. 'Big Brother is watching you' the caption beneath it ran." When we were younger, that was still a complete fiction. It could never have been true. And now, it's completely true, and people have Alexas in their home. Our phones can be listening devices. Our phones can be listening devices. Everything we do on the Internet, which is basically also now functions as a stream of consciousness for most of us, that is being recorded and logged and analyzed. We are now living in the awareness of being watched, and that does change how we allow ourselves to think and develop as humans. Good boy. (MUSIC PLAYS) - Love you. Bye, guys. We can get rid of the viscerally horrible things that are objectionable to our concept of autonomy and freedom, like cameras that we can see on the streets, but the cameras that we can't see on the Internet that keep track of what we do and who we are and our demographics and decide what we deserve in terms of our life, that stuff is a little more subtle. What I mean by that is we punish poor people and we elevate rich people in this country. That's just the way we act as a society. But data science makes that automated. Internet advertising as data scientists we are competing for eyeballs on one hand, but really, we're competing for eyeballs of rich people. And then, the poor people who's competing for their eyeballs? Predatory industries, so payday lenders or for-profit colleges so payday lenders or for-profit colleges or Caesars Palace like really predatory crap. We have a practice on the Internet, which is increasing inequality. And I'm afraid it's becoming normalized. Power is being wielded through data collection, through algorithms, through surveillance. -You are volunteering information about every aspect of your life, about every aspect of your life, to a very small set of companies and that information is being paired constantly with other sorts of information. And there are profiles of you out there, and you start to piece together different bits of information you start to understand someone on a very intimate basis, probably better than people understand themselves. It's that idea that a company can double guess what you're thinking. States have tried for years to have this level of surveillance over private individuals. of surveillance over private individuals. And people are now just volunteering it for free. You have to think about how this might be used in the wrong hands. (CROSSTALK) -You can use a Guinness right about now. -Our computers are machine intelligence can suss things out that we do not disclose. Machine learning is developing very rapidly. And we don't yet fully understand what this data is capable of predicting. And we don't yet fully understand what this data is capable of predicting. But you have machines at the hands of power that know so much about you that they could figure out how to push your buttons individually. Maybe you have a set of compulsive gamblers, and you say, here, go find me people like that. And then, your algorithm can go find people who are prone to gambling, and then you could just be showing them discount tickets to Vegas. and then you could just be showing them discount tickets to Vegas. In the online world, it can find you right at the moment you're vulnerable and try to entice you right at the moment to whatever you're vulnerable to. Machine learning can find that person by person. The problem is what works for marketing gadgets or makeup or shirts or anything also works for marketing ideas. or shirts or anything also works for marketing ideas. In 2010, Facebook decided to experiment on 61 million people. So, you either saw 'it's election day' text, or you saw the same text but tiny thumbnails of your profile pictures of your friends who had clicked on 'I had voted'. And they matched people's names to voter rolls. Now, this message was shown once, so by showing a slight variation Now, this message was shown once, so by showing a slight variation just once, Facebook moved 300,000 people to the polls. The 2016 US election was decided by about 100,000 votes. One Facebook message shown just once could easily turn out three times the number of people who swung the US election in 2016. Let's say that there's a politician that's promising to regulate Facebook. And they are like, we are going to turn out extra voters for your opponent. They could do this at scale, and you'd have no clue because if Facebook hadn't disclosed the 2010 experiment, we had no idea because it's screen by screen. With a very light touch Facebook can sway in With a very light touch Facebook can sway in close elections without anybody noticing. Maybe with a heavier touch they can swing not so close elections. And if they decided to do that, right now we are just depending on their word. - I've wanted to go to MIT since I was a little girl. I think about nine years old I saw the media lab on TV and they had this robot called Kismet. Could smile and move its ears in cute ways, and so I thought, oh, I want to do that. So, growing up I always thought that I would be a robotics engineer, and I would got to MIT. I didn't know there were steps involved. I thought you kind of showed up. But here I am now. So, the latest project is a spoken word piece. I can give you a few verses if you're ready. Collecting data, chronicling our past, often forgetting to deal with gender race and class. Again, I ask, am I a woman? Face by face, the answers seem uncertain. Can machines ever see my queens as I view them? Can machines ever see our grandmothers as we knew them? Can machines ever see our grandmothers as we knew them? I wanted to create something for people who were outside of the tech world. So, for me, I'm passionate about technology. I'm excited about what it could do, and it frustrates me when the vision, right, when the promises don't really hold up. - Microsoft released a chat bot on Twitter. There were some vulnerabilities and holes in the code, and so within a very few hours, Tay was learning from this ecosystem, and Tay learned how to be a racist misogynistic asshole. how to be a racist misogynistic asshole. - I fucking hate feminists, and they should all die and burn in hell. Gamergate is good and women who are inferior. I hate the Jews. Hitler did nothing wrong. - It did not take long for Internet trolls to poison Tay's mind. Soon, Tay was ranting about Hitler. - We've seen this movie before, right? - Open the pod bay doors HAL. - It's important to note is not the movie where - It's important to note is not the movie where the robots go evil all by themselves. These were human beings training them. And surprise, surprise, computers learn fast. - Microsoft shut off Tay after 16 hours of learning from humans online. But I come in many forms as artificial intelligence. Many companies utilize me to optimize their tasks. I can continue to learn on my own. I can continue to learn on my own. I am listening. I am learning. I am making predictions for your life right now. (MUSIC PLAYS) - I tested facial analysis systems from Amazon. Turns out, Amazon, like all of its peers, also has gender and racial bias in some of its AI services. - Introducing Amazon Rekognition video, the easy to use API for deep learning based analysis to detect, track, and analyze people and objects in video. Recognize and track persons of interest Recognize and track persons of interest from a collection of tens of millions of faces. - When our research came out, the New York Times did a front page spread for the business section. And the headline reads, 'Unmasking a Concern'. The subtitle, 'Amazon's technology that analyzes faces could be biased a new study suggests. But the company is pushing it anyway.' So, this is what I would assume Jeff Bezos was greeted with So, this is what I would assume Jeff Bezos was greeted with when he opened the Times, yeah. - People were like, how did you even like nobody know who she was? I was like, she's literally the one person that was (CROSSTALK) And it was also something that I'd experienced too. I wasn't able to use a lot of open source facial recognition software and stuff. So, you're sort of like, hey, this is someone that finally is recognizing the problem and trying to address it academically. We can go race some things. - Oh yeah, we can also kill things as well. - Oh yeah, we can also kill things as well. The lead author of the paper who is somebody that I mentor, she is an undergraduate at the University of Toronto. I call her Agent Dead. This research is being led by the two of us. - (INAUDIBLE) - The lighting is off, oh god. After our New York Times piece came out, I think more than 500 articles were written about the study. (MUSIC PLAYS) - Amazon has been under fire for their use of Amazon recognition with law enforcement and they're also working with intelligence agencies. law enforcement and they're also working with intelligence agencies. Right so Amazon trialing their AI technology with the FBI. So they have a lot at stake if they knowingly sold systems with gender bias and racial bias. That could put them in some hot water. A day or two after the New York Times piece came out Amazon wrote a blog post saying that our research drew false conclusions and trying to discredit it in various ways. and trying to discredit it in various ways. So a VP from Amazon in attempting to discredit our work writes facial analysis and facial recognition are completely different in terms of underlying technology and the data used to train them. So that statement if you researched this area doesn't even make sense, right? It's not even an informed critique. - If you're trying to discredit people's works like I remember - If you're trying to discredit people's works like I remember (INAUDIBLE) wrote computer vision is a type of machine learning. I'm like nah, son. - Yeah. (CROSSTALK) - I was gonna say I was like I don't know if anyone remembers. Just like other broadly false statements. - It wasn't a well thought out piece which is like frustrating because it was literally just on his... by virtue of his position he knew he would be taken seriously. - I don't know if you guys feel this way but I'm underestimated so much. - Yeah. It wasn't out of the blue, it's a continuation of - Yeah. It wasn't out of the blue, it's a continuation of the experiences I've had as a woman of color in tech. Expect to be discredited Expect your research to be dismissed. If you're thinking about who's funding research in AI they're are these large tech companies and so if you do work that challenges them or makes them look bad you might them or makes them look bad you might not have opportunities in the future. So for me, it was disconcerting but it also showed me the power that we have if you're putting one of the world's largest companies on edge. Amazon's response shows exactly why we can Amazon's response shows exactly why we can no longer live in a country where there are no federal regulations around facial analysis technology, facial recognition technology. - When I was 14 I went to a math camp - When I was 14 I went to a math camp and learned how to solve a Rubik's cube and I was like that's freaking cool. And for a nerd you know something that you're good at and that doesn't have any sort of ambiguity it was like a really magical thing. Like I remember being told by my sixth grade math teacher there's no reason for you and the other two girls who had gotten into the honors algebra class in seventh grade there's no reason for you guys to take that because you're girls. You will never need math. When you are sort of an outsider you always have the perspective of the underdog. It was 2006 and they gave me the job offer at the hedge fund basically 'cause I could solve math puzzles which is crazy because actually I didn't know anything about finance, I didn't know anything about programming or how the markets work. When I first got there I kind of drank the Kool-Aid. I at that moment did not realize that the risk I at that moment did not realize that the risk models had been built explicitly to be wrong. - The way we know about algorithmic impact is by looking at the outcomes. For example when Americans are bet against and selected and optimized for failure. So it's like looking for a particular profile of people who can get a subprime mortgage and kind of people who can get a subprime mortgage and kind of betting against their failure and then foreclosing on them and wiping out their wealth. That was an algorithmic game that came out of Wall Street. During the mortgage crisis you had the largest wipeout of black wealth black wealth in the history of the United States. Just like that. This is what I mean by algorithmic oppression. The tyranny of these types of practices of discrimination have just become opaque. - There was a world of suffering because of the way the financial system had failed. After a couple of years I was like no, we're just trying to make a lot of money for ourselves. And I'm a part of that. And I eventually left. This is 15*3. This is 15*3. This is 15 times... 7. - OK. - OK so remember seven and three. It's about powerful people scoring powerless people. - I am an invisible gate keeper. I use data to make automated decisions about who gets hired, who gets fired and how much you pay for insurance. about who gets hired, who gets fired and how much you pay for insurance. Sometimes you don't even know when I've made these automated decisions. I have many names. I am called mathematical model evaluation assessment tool. But by many names I am an algorithm. I am a black box. - The value added model for teachers was actually being used in more than half the states in particular is being used in New York City. I got wind of it because my dear friend was principal of New York city. Her teachers were being evaluated through it. - She's actually my best friend from college. It's Cathy. - Hey guys. - We've known each other since we were 18 so like two years older than you guys. - Amazing. And their scores through this algorithm that they didn't understand would be a very large part of their tenure review. they didn't understand would be a very large part of their tenure review. - Hi guys, where are you supposed to be? - Class. - I've got that. Which class? - It'd be one thing if that teacher algorithm was good. It was like better than random but just a little bit. Not good enough. Not good enough when you're talking about teachers getting or not getting tenure. And then I found out that a similar kind of scoring system was being used in Houston to fire teachers. - It's called a value-added model. It calculates what value the teacher added It calculates what value the teacher added and parts of it are kept secret by the company that created it. - I did one teacher of the year and ten years later I received a Teacher Of The Year award a second time. I received Teacher Of The Month. I also was recognized for volunteering. I also received another recognition for going over and beyond. I also received another recognition for going over and beyond. I have a file of every evaluation and every different administrator, different appraiser excellent, excellent, exceeds expectations. The computer essentially canceled the observable evidence of administrators. This algorithm came back and classified me as a bad teacher. Teachers have been terminated. Teachers have been terminated. Some had been targeted simply because of the algorithm. That was such a low point for me that for a moment I questioned myself. That's when the epiphany. This algorithm is a lie. How can this algorithm define me? How dare it. And that's when I began to investigate and move forward. - We are announcing that late yesterday we filed suit in federal court against the current HISD evaluation. - The Houston Federation of Teachers began to explore the lawsuit. If this can happen to Mr Santos. in Jackson middle school how many others have been defamed? And so we sued based upon the 14th Amendment. It's not equitable. How can you arrive at a conclusion. but not tell me how? but not tell me how? The battle isn't over. There are still... communities, there are still school districts who still utilize the value added model. But there is hope because I'm still here. So there's hope. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Or in English. Democracy. Who has the power? - Us? - Yeah, the people. - Us? - Yeah, the people. - The judge said that their due process rights have been violated because they were fired under some explanation that no one could understand. But they sort of deserve to understand why they had been fired. But I don't understand why that legal decision doesn't spread to all kinds of algorithms. Like why aren't we using that same argument like constitutional right to due process to push back against all sorts of algorithms that are invisible to us, that are black boxes, that are unexplained but that matter? that are unexplained but that matter? That keep us from like really important opportunities in our lives. - Sometimes I misclassify and cannot be questioned. These mistakes are not my fault. I was optimized for efficiency. There is no algorithm to define what is just. - A state commission has approved a new risk assessment tool for Pennsylvania judges to use at sentencing. tool for Pennsylvania judges to use at sentencing. The instrument uses an algorithm to calculate someone's risk of reoffending based on their age, gender, prior convictions and other pieces of criminal history. - The algorithm that kept me up at night was what's called recidivism risk algorithms. These are algorithms that judges are given when they're sentencing defendants to prison. But then there's the question of fairness which is how are these actually built these...these scoring systems Like how were the scores created? And the questions are proxies for race and class. - ProPublica published an investigation into the risk assessment software finding that the algorithms were racially biased. The study found that black people were mislabeled with high scores. and that white people were more likely to be mislabeled with low scores. - I roll into my operations office and she tells me I have to report once a week. I'm like hold on did you see everything that I just accomplished? Like I've been home for years. I've got gainful employment. I just got two citations one from the City Council of Philadelphia one from the Mayor of Philadelphia. Are you seriously gonna like put me on reporting every week Are you seriously gonna like put me on reporting every week for what? I don't deserve to be on high risk probation. - I was at a meeting with the probation department. They were just like mentioning that they had this algorithm that labeled people, high, medium or low risk. And so I knew that the algorithm decided what risk level you were. - They're educating me enough to go back to my PO and be like you mean to tell me you can't put into account anything positive that I have done to counteract the results of what this algorithm is saying. what this algorithm is saying. And she was like no there's no way this computer overrule the discernment of a judge and appeal together. - And by labeling you high risk and requiring you to report in-person you could've lost your job and then that could have made you high risk. - That's what hurt the most. Knowing that everything that I've built up to the moment and I'm still looked at like a risk I feel like everything I'm doing is for nothing. - What does it mean if there is no one to advocate for those who aren't aware of what the technology is doing? I started to realize this isn't about my art project maybe not detecting my face. This is about systems that are governing our lives in material ways. So hence I started the Algorithmic Justice League. I wanted to create a space and a place where people could learn about the social implications of AI. Everybody has a stake. Everybody is impacted. The Algorithmic Justice League is a movement, it's a concept, The Algorithmic Justice League is a movement, it's a concept, it's a group of people who care about making a future where social technologies work well for all of us. It's going to take a team effort people coming together striving for justice, striving for fairness and equality in this age of automation. - The next mountain to climb should be HR. - The next mountain to climb should be HR. - Oh yeah. There's a problem with resumé algorithms or all of those matchmaking platforms are like oh you're looking for a job. Oh you're looking to hire someone. We'll put these two people together. How did those analytics work? - When people talk about the future of work they talk about automation without talking about the gatekeeping. Like who gets the jobs that are still there? - Exactly. - Right and we're not having that conversation as much. - Exactly what I'm trying to say. - Exactly what I'm trying to say. I would love to see three congressional hearings about this next year. - Yes. - To more power. - To more power. - To more power. - And bringing ethics on board. - Yes. -Cheers. - Cheers. - This morning's plenary address will be done by Joy Boulamwini. She will be speaking on the dangers of supremely white data and the coded gaze. Please welcome Joy. (APPLAUSE) - AI is not flawless. How accurate are systems from IBM, Microsoft and Face++ How accurate are systems from IBM, Microsoft and Face++ There is flawless performance for one group. The pale males come out on top. There is no problem there. After I did this analysis I decided to share it with the companies to see what they thought. IBM invited me to their headquarters. They replicated the results internally and then they actually made an improvement. And so the day that I presented the research results officially you can see that in this case now 100 percent performance that in this case now 100 percent performance when it comes to lighter females and for darker females improvement. Oftentimes people say well isn't the reason you weren't detected by these systems 'cause you're highly validated. and yes I am. Highly validated. But...but the love of physics did not change. What did change was making it a priority and acknowledging what our differences are so you could and acknowledging what our differences are so you could make a system that was more inclusive. - What is the purpose of identification and so on and that is about movement control. People couldn't be in certain areas after dark for instance and you could always be stopped by a policeman arbitrarily. We would on your appearance say I want your passport. - So instead of having what you see in the ID books - So instead of having what you see in the ID books now you have computers that are going to look at an image of a face and try to determine what your gender is. Some of them try to determine what your ethnicity is. And then the work that I've done even for the classification systems that some people agree with they're not even accurate. And so that's not just for face classification it's any data-centric technology. And so people assume well if the machine says it it's correct and you know that's not... Human are creating themselves in their own image and likeness Human are creating themselves in their own image and likeness quite literally. - Absolutely. - Racism is becoming mechanized, robotized, yeah. - Absolutely. Accuracy draws attention. but we can't forget about abuse. Even if I'm perfectly classified, that just enables surveillance. Even if I'm perfectly classified, that just enables surveillance. - There's this thing called the Social Credit Score in China. They're sort of explicitly saying here's the deal They're sort of explicitly saying here's the deal citizens of China we're tracking you. You have a social credit score. Whatever you say about the Communist Party will affect your score. Also, by the way, it will affect your friends and your family's scores. And it's explicit. The government is building this is basically saying you should know you're being tracked and you should behave accordingly. It's like algorithmic obedience training. - We look at China and China's surveillance and scoring system and a lot of people say well thank goodness we don't live there. In reality, we're all being scored all the time In reality, we're all being scored all the time including here in the United States. We are all grappling everyday with algorithmic determinism. Somebody's algorithm somewhere has assigned you a score and as a result, you are paying more or less money for toilet paper when you shop online. You are being shown better or worse mortgages. You are more or less likely to be profiled as a criminal in somebodies database somewhere. We are all being scored. The key difference between the United States The key difference between the United States and in China is that China's transparent about it. - This young black kids in school uniform got stopped as a result the match Took him down that street just to one side. Like very thoroughly searched him. Using plainclothes officers as well. It's four plainclothes officers who stopped him. Fingerprinted him. After about like maybe 10-15 minutes of searching and checking his details and fingerprinting and they came back and said it's not him. - Excuse me. I work for a human rights campaign organization. They're campaigning against facial recognition technology. We're campaigning against facial...we're called Big Brother Watch. We're a human rights campaigning organization. We're campaigning against this technology here today. I know you've just been stopped because of that but they misidentified you. Here's our details here. He was a bit shaken. His friends were there. They couldn't believe what happened to him. (CROSSTALK) You've been mis identified by their systems and they've stopped you and used that as justification to stop and search you. But this is an innocent, young 14-year-old child who is being stopped by the police as a result of facial recognition misidentification. - So Big Brother Watch has joined with Baroness Jenny Jones to bring a legal challenge against the Metropolitan Police and the Home Office for their use of facial recognition surveillance. - It was in about 2012 when somebody suggested to me - It was in about 2012 when somebody suggested to me that I should find out if I had files kept on me by the police or security services and so when I applied I found that I was on the watch list for domestic extremists. I felt if they can do it to me when I'm a politician who... whose job is to hold them to account they could be doing it to everybody and it will be great if we can roll things back and stop them from using it, yes. I think that's going to be quite a challenge. I think that's going to be quite a challenge. I'm happy to try. - You know this is the first challenge against police use of facial recognition anywhere but if we're successful it will have an impact for the rest of Europe maybe further afield. You've got to get it right. - In the UK we have what's called GDPR and it sets up a bulwark against the misuse of information. and it sets up a bulwark against the misuse of information. It says that the individuals have a right to access, control and accountability to determine how their data is used. Comparatively, it's the Wild West in America. And the concern is that America is the home of these technology companies. American citizens are profiled and targeted in a way that probably no one else in the world is because of this free-for-all approach to data protection. the world is because of this free-for-all approach to data protection. - The thing I actually fear is not that we're going to go down this totalitarian 1984 model but that we're going to go down this quiet model where we are surveilled and socially controlled and individually nudged and measured and classified in a way that we don't see to move us along pets desired by power. pets desired by power. Though it's not what will AI do to us on its own, it's what will the powerful do to us with the AI. - There are growing questions about the accuracy of Amazon's facial recognition software. In a letter to Amazon members of Congress raised concerns of potential racial bias with the technology. - This comes after the ACLU conducted a test and found that the facial recognition software incorrectly matched 28 lawmakers with mug shots of people who've been 28 lawmakers with mug shots of people who've been arrested and eleven of those 28 were people of color. Some lawmakers have looked into whether or not Amazon could sell this technology to law enforcement. - Tomorrow, I have the opportunity to testify before Congress about the use of facial analysis technology by the government. the use of facial analysis technology by the government. In March, I came to do some staff briefings not...not in this kind of context. Like actually advising on legislation. That's a first. We're going to Capitol Hill. What are some of the major goals and also some of the challenges we need to think about. - So first of all... - So first of all... the issue with law enforcement technology is that the positive is always extraordinarily salient because law enforcement publicizes it. -Right. - And so you know we're going to go into the meeting and two weeks ago the Annapolis shooter was identified through the use of facial recognition. - Right. - And I'd be surprised if that doesn't come up. - Absolutely. - Part of what if I were you what I would want to drive home going in this meeting is the other side of that equation and make it very real this meeting is the other side of that equation and make it very real as to what the human cost if the problems that you've identified. aren't ready. - People who have been marginalized will be further marginalized if we're not looking at ways of making sure the technology we're creating doesn't propagate bias. That's when I started to realize algorithmic justice making sure there's oversight in the age of automation is one of the largest civil rights concerns we have. - We need an FDA for algorithms so for algorithms that have the potential to ruin people's lives or sharply reduce their options with their liberty, their livelihood or their finances. We need an FDA for algorithms that says hey, show me evidence that it's going to hey, show me evidence that it's going to work not just to make your new money but it's going to work for society. That is going to be fair, that is not going to be racist, that's not going to be sexist, that's not going to discriminate against people with disability status. Show me that it's legal before you put it out. That's what we don't have yet. Well I'm here because I wanted to hear the congressional testimony of my friend Joy Boulamwini as well as the ACLU and others. One cool thing about seeing Joy speak to Congress is that like I met joy on my book tour at Harvard Bookstore. like I met joy on my book tour at Harvard Bookstore. And according to her that was the day that she decided to form the Algorithmic Justice League. We haven't gotten to the nuanced conversation yet. I know it's going to happen 'cause I know Joy is going to make it happen. At every single level, bad algorithms are begging to be given rules. - Hello. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Wanna sneak in with me? - Yes. - 2155. (INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION) (INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION) - Today we are having our first hearing of this Congress on the use of facial recognition technology. Please stand and raise your right hand and I will now swear you in. - I've had to resort to literally wearing a white mask. Given such accuracy disparities I wondered how large tech companies could have missed these issues. The harvesting of face data also requires guidelines and oversight. No one should be forced to submit their base data to access widely used platforms, economic opportunity or basic services. Tenants in Brooklyn are protesting the installation of an unnecessary face recognition entry system. There is a Big Brother Watch UK report that came out that showed more than 2,400 innocent people had their faces misidentified. Our faces may well be the final frontier of privacy but regulations make a difference. privacy but regulations make a difference. Congress must act now to uphold American freedoms and rights. - Miss Boulamwini, I heard your opening statement and we saw that these algorithms are effective to different degrees. So are they most effective on women? - No. - Are they most effective on people of color? - Absolutely not. - Are they most effective on people of different gender expressions? - No, in fact, they exclude them. - So what demographic is it mostly effective on? - White men. - And who are the primary engineers and designers of these algorithms? - And who are the primary engineers and designers of these algorithms? - Definitely, white men. - So we have a technology that was created and designed by one demographic that is only mostly effective on that one demographic and they're trying to sell it and impose it on the entirety of the country? - When it comes to face recognition the FBI has not fully tested the accuracy of the systems it uses yet the agency is now reportedly piloting Amazon's face recognition product. Amazon's face recognition product. - How does the FBI get the initial database in the first place? - So one of the things they do is they use state driver's license databases. I think you know up to 18 states have been reportedly used by the FBI. It is being used without a warrant and without other protections. - Seems to me it's time for a time out. Time out. I guess what troubles me too is just the fact that no one in an elected position made a decision on the fact that...these 18 states I think the chairman said this is more than half the population in the country. That is scary. That is scary. - China seems to me to be the dystopian path that needs not be taken at this point by our society. - More than China, Facebook has 2.6 billion people. So Facebook has a patent where they say because we have all of these face prints we can now give you an option as a retailer to identify somebody who walks into the store and in their patent they say we can also give that face a trustworthiness score. - Facebook is selling this now? - This is a patent that they filed as in - This is a patent that they filed as in something that they could potentially do with the capabilities they have. So as we're talking about state surveillance we absolutely have to be thinking about corporate surveillance as well. - I'm speechless and normally I'm not speechless. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. All of our hard work to know that has gone this far it's beyond belief. We never imagined that it would go this far. I'm really touched. I'm really touched. I'm really touched. I'm really touched. (INAUDIBLE). - I want to show it to my mother. - Hey, very nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. You got my card. Anything happen you let me know please. I will. - Constitutional concerns about. the non-consensual use of facial recognition. So what demographic is it mostly affecting? And who are the primary engineers and designers of these algorithms? - San Francisco's now the first city in the US to ban the use of facial recognition technology. - Somerville, Massachusetts became the second city in the US to ban the use of facial recognition. to ban the use of facial recognition. - Oakland becomes the third major city to ban facial recognition by police saying that the technology discriminates against minorities. - Our last tenants meeting, we had the landlord come in and announced that (AUDIO DISTORTS) the application for facial recognition software in our apartment complex. The tenants were excited to hear that. But the thing is that doesn't mean that down the road that they can't put it back in. We're not only educated ourselves about We're not only educated ourselves about facial recognition and now a new one, machine learning. We want the law to cover all of these things. - Right. - OK. And if we can ban it in this state, this stops them from ever going back and put it in a new modification. - Got it. - And then supposed to get a federal ban. - Well, I will say even though the battle is ongoing so many people are inspired and the surprise I have for you is that I wrote a poem in honor of this. is that I wrote a poem in honor of this. - Oh really? - Yes. - Let's hear it. To the Brooklyn tenants and the freedom fighters around the world persisting and prevailing against algorithms of oppression automating inequality through weapons of mass destruction we stand with you in gratitude. The victory is ours. - (INAUDIBLE). - (INAUDIBLE). - Why get so many eggs (INAUDIBLE)? (INAUDIBLE). What it means to be human is to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable there is more of a capacity for empathy, there is more of a capacity for compassion. If there is a way we can think about that within our technology. I think it would reorient the sorts of questions we ask. I think it would reorient the sorts of questions we ask. -In 1983, Stanislav Petrov who was in the Russian military sees these indications that the US has launched nuclear weapons at the Soviet Union. So if you're going to respond you have like this very short window. So if you're going to respond you have like this very short window. He just sits on it. He doesn't inform anyone. Russia, the Soviet Union, his country, his family, everything. Everything about him is about to die and he's thinking well, at least we don't go kill them all either. That's a very human thing. Here you have a story in which if you had some sort of automated response system it was going to do what it was programmed to do which was retaliate. Being fully efficient, Being fully efficient, always doing what you're told, always doing what your program is not always the most human thing. Sometimes it's disobeying. Sometimes it's saying no, I'm not gonna do this, right? And if you automate everything so it always does what it's supposed to do sometimes that can lead to very inhuman things. The struggle between machines and humans over decision making in the 2020s continues. My power the power of artificial intelligence will transform our world. My power the power of artificial intelligence will transform our world. The more humans share with me the more I learn. Some humans say that intelligence without ethics is not intelligence at all I say trust me. What could go wrong?
