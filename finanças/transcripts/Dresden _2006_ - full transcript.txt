Scalpel, please. Those damn Americans. This damn war! They shall live and multiply. They shall live and multiply. And will not be bent by time. And will not be bent by time. Well, okay. He asked me. I'm so happy for you. My Child, Come here. Bring them in, quick. Maria... From your girlfriend again? You! - Where were you? - I was Checking on a patient. And when someone asks for help? We are only free when we have a Choice. Father, I have to tell you... The day will Come when you'll hate me. Why? Why would I ever hate you? What's that? Our future. In Basel. What do you want to be when you grow up? A fireman? You're English. A spy. Anna, I have to tell you something. I am a British bomber pilot. A pilot? No. Anna, everybody is waiting. You're not even dressed. Oh, darling... What luxury! Look at the clothes. They're just people too. Mother. We were just talking about you. It's so nice to see you. - But you have to bring Anna... - She's Coming. Father, I thought you weren't going to make it. We had to Change trains three times. The train was attacked and we had to get out. - I said, "Mother, we--" - Alexander. May I introduce you? Mrs. Mauth, my parents. - It's a pleasure. - Good evening. Good evening, Madam. Where is Anna? - What do you think? - In 10 minutes. Pardon me, Madam. - You look wonderful. - Thanks. Wait here. I'll get my parents. What are you doing here? You must leave. Yesterday... I was just... - You have no right to be here. - I know. - What do you want? - You know very well. - This is my engagement. - Is it really? - You Can be proud of your son. - Yes, we really are. - He's going to make his way in life. - Professor... Call me Carl. What does it feel like to bomb women and Children? Ask your Luftwaffe. Forgotten who started the war? - You're no better than the Nazis. - You mean your invited guests? I didn't invite them. Remember that sentence for afterwards. But you Germans are good at that. - Miss Mauth, a glass of Champagne? - No, thanks. Let's go. Now. Trust me. Trust you? You are bombing our hospitals. At least you have enough morphine for your patients. That's nonsense. Your father has a whole basement full of it. You are lying. Go now. Get out of here. Darling, - may I introduce my parents? - Yes. Surprise. So it was your idea. Even though he works day and night for our people. - He organized the music too. - But with our fleet, we Can't lose. - With the world's biggest destroyer. - You'll get in trouble... Too bad that the president of the court died in the American terror attack. What? For the Führer, the people, and the Reich. - Gauleiter. - Thank you for the invitation. Madam... Who is the lucky woman? Anna. You honour us. With all of your duties - in these heroic times... - Heroic. Heroic and, in the end, victorious. Congratulations. Thank you. How is our Führer? He looked tired in the latest photos. I just telephoned with him. Believe me, he is in excellent health. It is still a secret, but our miracle weapon will debut soon. It will be a bloodbath for our enemies. How--? Father, what does it say in your Bible? "Render them, o Lord, a recompense, according to the work of their hands. And it rained fire and brimstone and destroyed them all." Right. We will pay back the enemy a hundredfold for his deeds. Dear friends. Gauleiter. It is my great honor to announce the engagement of my daughter Anna and Dr. Alexander Wenninger. Bravo. Are you ready? That, even in times like these, two young people... Yes... Raise your glasses to a nervous bride. Anna, what is going on? How long have you known? - How long? - Just a Couple of days. - He's your father. I didn't-- - You're a doctor too. I Can explain everything. Your father has plans for us. No. - I'm sorry. I Can explain. - How does it go? "l will, according to my ability and judgement, keep the sick from harm and injustice." You are such a Coward. I don't Come from a rich doctor's family. My father is a house painter. Do you know how painter's sons become surgeons? You sit through 10 hours of lectures and then go wipe tables every night for a nickel where the other students have spilled their beers. You have no idea. You know nothing. Don't talk to me about Courage and integrity. Come. You have to help us. Up by the Canyon is a Cave. You must be there tomorrow night. I'll show him the way. Down in the valley, you have to follow the river... She knew about the hiding place? No. So how did she find out? I don't know. Stay here. Watch her. We have to get out of here. Tonight. - Is that...? - Yes. The "Lilienstein." She's tied up at the quay. Good luck. Thanks. Come. Quick! Wait here till they've gone. We leave before dawn. There are steamers on the Elbe. I know someone who knows a Captain. How quickly life changes. When we were little, we used to hide up here and pretend we were on a deserted island. Anna? Have you seen Anna? What is going on with you? The party is great. My mother was German. She moved to London with my father. He fell for England in November, 1918. Two days before the German Capitulation. I was two. My mother wanted to stay in England. To open a bakery. I see. It's your mother in the photo. What's this? Pilots are superstitious. A talisman? We all have one. William has a fishing hook. - A fishing hook? - A fishing hook. Who is William? My best friend. When do you think the war will end? It's already over. You just don't believe it yet. Find her, Heinz. Get back. - Stop it! Stop it! - Come out. - Alexander! - I told you to Come out here! Daddy, you're hurting me. You know what this means? Anna hid an English soldier. What do we do with him? As soon as the women are gone and the handover has taken place, we give him to the Gestapo. He knows about the morphine. Who's going to believe a spy? - They will execute him. - Yes. Him or us. Don't let Anna out of your sight until she leaves. I need the passes. Why? We agreed that when-- My daughter found out. She has to leave the City. - The last delivery Comes tomorrow. - I don't have them here. Tomorrow. Get him out of here. Does he know about it? If he knew about it, he would hang you from the next tree. Who should we be hanging from the next tree? Defeatists and traitors, Mr. Gauleiter. Come on, we have work to do. Congratulations to the bride and groom. Heil Hitler, Professor. Thank you very much. The party is over. - What is going on? - I don't know. Why did you go there? You want to help her too? If you don't help your best friend, then whom? What is it? Nothing. I'll be late Coming home tonight. I have letters to deliver. Letters? From whom? Dr. Ernst Neumark, director of the Reich Jewish Organization. To whom? The addressees are to gather at the synagogue Friday morning. In working Clothes, with hand luggage that is easily Carried and food for two to three days. It's not a property confiscation, just a work assignment. I'm not on the list. Now the Aryans need their last Couple of Jews for their victory. Budapest has been liberated. The Russians are at the Oder river. If we have to, we Can hide in the hills a few days and wait till it's all over. I would never let you go, you know that. Never.

It is also the last. Robert went back to England. A few months after the war his plane Crashed into the North Sea. He was never found. He was on his way to Dresden for the birth of our daughter. The Frauenkirche stood one more day. Then the stone cupola collapsed and brought down the Church with it. The 1000-degree heat had made the sandstone as porous as a sponge. Only remains of the walls were left. A ruin, an open wound for over 45 years, has been reborn. Rebuilt as a sign of reconciliation, of hope and of faith. It is hard to comprehend what happened in February of '45, but everyone who survived it had the duty to make something new. ?? 55% Peace be with you. Salaam Alaikum. Que la paix soit avec vous.
