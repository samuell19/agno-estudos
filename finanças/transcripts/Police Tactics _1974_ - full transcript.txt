TOEl COMPANY PRESENTS In 1945, among the burned-out rubble of Kure City in Hiroshima, SHOZO HIRONO FUTURE BOSS OF HIRONO FAMILY a band of repatriated soldiers led by Shozo Hirono, fired by youthful ambition, embarked on a quest for dominance in the violent world! Of the yakuza. However, BOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY YOSHIO YAMAMORI between Boss Yoshio Yamamori's crafty maneuvering, and bitter struggles for power among the younger bosses under his wing, one young leader after another was consigned to his grave. In 1962, Yamamori succeeded in taking over Hiroshima City's most powerful yakuza family, the Muraoka family. BOSS OF UCHIMOTO FAMILY NOBORU UCHIMOTO Stung by this turn, rival sub-boss Noboru Uchimoto BOSS OF AKASHI FAMILY TATSUO AKASHI swore loyalty to Kobe's Akashi family, which held sway over much of western Japan. CAPTAIN OF YAMAMORI FAMILY AKIRATAKEDA At the urging of Captain Akira Takeda, CHAIRMAN OF THE SHINWAGROUP KUMASHIRO UNOKICHI Yamamori allied himself with the Akashi family's rival, the Shinwa Group. Hiroshima thus became the battlefront in the struggle for power between Western Japan?s two largest syndicates. To defuse the crisis, FAMILY ELDER KENICHI OKUBO Hirono joined with Kure's Kenichi Okubo UNDERBOSS OF AKASHI FAMILY SHINICHI IWAI and Shinichi Iwai of the Akashi family to scheme for Yamamori's retirement. But he ran afoul of Takeda, who was determined to defend the family, and was expelled from the Yamamori family. The Akashi family retaliated by expelling Hideo Hayakawa, FORMER UNDERBOSS OF UCHIMOTO FAMILY HIDEO HAYAKAWA an Uchimoto family under boss who had cozied up to Yamamori. Hayakawa promptly joined the Yamamoris and attacked the Uchimoto family. Thus it was that the two cities of Hiroshima and Kure became the stage for a bloody war between the Uchimoto and Hirono families, under the wing of the Akashi family, and the Yamamoris, affiliated with the Shinwa Group.

In answer to the growing outcry, the police mounted a nationwide crackdown aimed at wiping outtakes syndicates. Move it! Out of the way! Out of the way! I said move your ass! Chief! This is the only gun we can find A matchlock? This sure as hell ain't what you been fighting with! Despite the authorities efforts, central Hiroshima was divided down the middle-east and west- UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY SHOICHI EDA the Yamamori family facing off against the Uchimoto family. Reinforcements for the Yamamori side began to pour in from across Western Honshu. Yamamori ensconced himself in the cabaret he owned and flamboyantly paraded to the bathhouse each morning with an army of bodyguards. Meanwhile, in Kure, the Makihara family, under Yamamori's wing, was embroiled in guerrilla warfare with the Hirono family. We've got an emergency summons! UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY MASAKICHI MAKIHARA Hirono's having lunch with Ueda on Naka Avenue Go take him down! Boss! What's up? Get in! Makihara's men are coming! Quick! In the car! The rank and file of each family pulsed with renewed life, just as Hirono and his cohorts had in an earlier day. The cops' detectors will never sniff'em out this way Not a chance! Fuck! Someone's coming! Act like you're taking a leak! No, over here! Don?t suppose this'll make'em rust, do you? Watch where you're aiming, asshole! What's with the shaved heads? With war coming, we thought we'd purify body and soul We're giving up women too, so stay away from us You're probably just shaking in your shoes and can't get it up Watch it, bitch! Come back here! MEMBEROF HAYAKAWA FAMILY HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Bro! What are you doing here in your condition? - Hello, boss - Well, well, Matsui! - I heard about the troubles - Take a load off! I thought they had you hospitalized back home I heard there was a fight brewing I couldn't sit still I figured I could still stop a bullet or two, if nothing else You should be looking to your health and taking it easy Haven?t seen you around here in a long time, Mieko It's been three years That long? Have a drink Did ya get it? Hop in a sec Nice heft Try it If there's a war, I'll need more Hope I can count on you again Have you heard, Fukuda? Mieko's back in Hiroshima Mieko? That's right: Mieko Your old squeeze A friend of mine saw her in Hiroshima Who could it be? Gotta go I've got some people waiting - I'll be back for more - Anytime Wonder if she was a good piece of ass What're you daydreaming about? Get moving! MEMBEROF HIRONO FAMILY SHIGERU TAKEMOTO MEMBEROF HIRONO FAMILY KIYOSHI KAWANISHI - Who is it? - Me. Boss I had some business in Hiroshima, so I thought I'd stop by Could you have a look at this? Something's wrong with the firing pin Sure Then you'd better take this I'll be okay You never know when you might need it Be careful about accidents Whatcha got there? Cyanide Dust a case shot with this and one shot is all it takes Now that we've got the hardware, how about you send us to ice Makihara? Don't be so antsy He may be our enemy now, but he and I were brothers under Yamamori I can't just go waltzing in and knock him off And the cops are snooping around for an excuse to revoke your parole, so you got to think about that, too Right You guys be careful, now If you have to go out, take someone with you I'll be going, then Hirono had been convicted of murder 14 years earlier, and was still on parole from his 20-yearsentence. Welcome! Is Uchimoto here? UCHIMOTO FAMILY Hold it right there! Where do you think you're going? I'm Hirono from Kure - Sorry, sir - Don?ts care me like that Welcome! Where the hell's he from? Needs to learn some manners Just got out of the joint He's a bit on edge I see Hey there This is Kawada from the Westside He's gonna stand with us, BOSS OF KAWADA FAMILY HIDEMITSU KAWADA so I'd like to take him along I'm Kawada It's a pleasure We just got a call from Okajima He's waiting for us I guess we better get going The man they went to see that day was Tomoji Okajima, the head of the Gisei Group, which had long controlled gambling CHAIRMAN OF GISEl GROUP TOMOJI OKAJIMA in Hiroshima's western suburbs. Okajima was a temperate man, always maintaining his neutrality in the frequent flare-ups between families. But he was also a man of influence, whom Hirono needed on his side if he was to gain the upper hand in Hiroshima. The boss will be right in All us younger members favor fighting on your side, so go ahead and press him hard UNDERBOSS OF GISEl GROUP SHOICHI FUJITA Thanks I appreciate it How's your health been? Reasonably good, thanks You know him well? Yeah We were in the joint together He has chest problems, so I looked out for him Now he's trying to return the favor You know, if Okajima balks, I really see no point in twisting his arm I've got Kawada collecting around here for baseball gambling, but lately Okajima's been showing signs of interest Sure, it'd be nice having him on our side, but I wouldn?t want him horning in on Kawada's turf Look, Uchimoto We'd all have it a lot easier if you could protect your own neck I didn't pick this fight You disrespected Yamamori and got us into this Why don?t you hurry up and knock him off? Don?t worry, Kawada Okajima won't do anything uncalled for You needn't worry about me Sorry to keep you waiting Excuse me Fujita here has filled me in on what you?re here about, but I'm afraid I can't commit myself to either side I'm a sworn brother of both Hirono here and Yamamori's captain, Takeda Has Takeda been to see you? No And if he had, my answer would be the same If you go ahead with this fight, where's it going to leave you? You blow a wad of money and lose a bunch of men, and what do you gain? Why should I want to take sides, only to have the other at my throat? Can?t you settle this peacefully somehow with Yamamori? I've been saying we should talk to Yamamori, but Hirono won't listen to me Won't listen? What exactly did you intend to say to Yamamori? I'm on his team for 18 years, and he just kicks me out? Don?t forget how things got to this point Every time we try to make peace, we get stabbed in the back And you're no exception, Okajima You don?t say anything, so Yamamori keeps skimming off your take If we back down now, you think Yamamori will still stay off your turf? There's a war coming, Okajima, whether you like it or not If you're not clear on who your friends and enemies are, you're the one who's gonna get hurt You can claim neutrality all you want, but hotheaded young toughs don't have time for fine distinctions What do you say? Try to see stairway The Giants are coming up to bat. MEMBEROF KAWADA FAMILY HIROSHI YAZAKI With a three-run homer in the third, the Giants are off to a good start. Sorry it's taking so long Who's winning? The Giants are up 3-to-0 What handicap did you guys go with today? Three points on Hiroshima We held it at two Guess it wasn't enough You'll have to teach me more about handicaps Since we're going to be brothers and all Thanks Your boss sure does like to hem and haw Someday he's gonna weep for it Stop getting so friendly with outsiders! All right, Hirono, I understand If you think I can be of service, count me in But on one condition: I have some thoughts of my own, so promise me you won't do anything rash Sure thing I'll be grateful for your help Meanwhile, in Kure, blood was already being shed. Hirono family under boss Kiyoshi Kawanishi was gunned down in the street. After a brief argument with several members of the Makihara family, he had drawn his gun and pulled the trigger three times, but the gun misfired every time, at which point one of his antagonists SEPTEMBER 10, 1963 KIYOSHI KAWANISHI DIED shot him dead. Boss Uchimoto, Hirono is upstairs with Okubo and Iwai! I have urgent business in Hiroshima They were quite insistent They want to discuss our next move Don?t you know the cops are right outside? I didn?t come to a funeral to get nabbed in your fucking war! What if the Yamamori family decides to raid us now? Who the fuck's gonna protect me? Looks like Uchimoto's leaving They didn?t stop him? - Sorry, boss - Forget it I was never really counting on the bastard anyway Kawanishi died in my place If I'm gonna repay his sacrifice, I've got to do Yamamori myself Get ready to attack Hiroshima soon as the cops out front go home - Don't do it - Why not? From what I've heard, the cops will be waiting to nab every last one of you You can't fight a war if you're kowtowing to the fucking cops Hear me out! Since Yamamori and Makihara have run for cover in Hiroshima, all you have to do is lock Kure down Make it so they can't return, and they'll have to admit defeat Remember, most of Yamamori's money comes from here in Kure I agree If you go to Hiroshima, there's gonna be blood for sure Any chance of making peace will be gone Making peace? How the fuck you expect to make peace with Yamamori? His view of things is simple: Kill or be killed You got to move first, or you?ll never get the upper hand again Look what happened to Kawanishi Got killed because I was preening around But you can't do anything that would destroy your honor No matter what he's done now, Yamamori used to be your boss I don't give a fucking shit about honor anymore! I'll happily kill myself after I take Yamamori down Then have it your way But the Akashi family has its own honor to uphold We can't join a fight that makes no fucking sense Who the hell asked you? I never expected a bunch of outsiders to fight my battles for me! BOSS OF UEDA FAMILY TOSHIO UEDA Take it easy, bro Mr. Iwai, Hirono's got us, so he can do without Akashi's backing, but we need a clear signal from Kobe: Are you more interested in keeping egg off your own faces or supporting us here in Kure? Your answer will affect our plans Look, Hirono I'm in an awkward position here The family's been having some trouble out east, so Boss Akashi's gone up to Tokyo It means he hasn't had time for the brothers I need you to be patient Don't put me in an impossible spot with the other brothers and the boss Besides, you're only out on parole If you get nabbed and have to serve your term, everything falls apart Think it over, will you? Ueda What the hell do you think you're doing? Who told you to speak up for Hirono? - But, sir- - I've got businesses to protect! You want to help Hirono, you'll have to break with me first When are you gonna get off my tail? Did you talk to Hirono? I told him to stay in Kure What else can I do? I shouldn't be seen with you, so hurry up and go All right, then I'll go quietly today But if Hirono shows up in Hiroshima, it's gonna be your head, no matter how precious it is Keep that in mind TAKEDA& CO Goddamn punk! Buy your own drinks, asshole! Quiet! Sorry Asshole! What was that about? One of the reinforcements from Osaka wanted more pocket money Who the fuck's he think he is? If he comes again, give him a good working over Boss Yamamori sent these around Hotel bills for the reinforcements? Let the boss pay them He refuses The hotels are threatening to go to the police Restaurants Geishas Drinks They sure are having a good time living on someone else's purse What's this one for 180,000? The tab from the noodle shop Boss Yamamori takes them to They say the more the merrier, but I'd call it too much of a good thing The massive costs of supporting the visiting troops was a bigger headache than the feud itself. Sensing this, the police kept a close eye on collections activity and sought to disrupt the families cash flow. Hold it! You won't getaway with it, punk! I am not doing nothing You're coming with us! Let me go! - Come on He didn't do anything - Run! Stop! Makihara here's been completely shutout of Kure You need to mount a joint attack and crush Hirono It's not that simple Hirono has the Akashi family behind him We need to find the right moment I'm working on a plan We knew about the Akashis all along Why should that stop us now? That's right You've got it easy sitting back here in your safe zone, but consider my situation You think we've got it easy? In that case, you won?t mind paying these goddamned bills! That's what our visitors are costing us When have you ever paid a yen? Let's not quibble about money, Takeda Look, boss, my war chest is down to Yen100 mil, and collecting is getting tough How am I supposed to fight a war with that? What are you worrying about money for, bro? Boss Yamamori is chairman of the Boat Racing Association He's rolling in money That's right He can cover the bills Right, boss? Tell him you'll pay The Racing Association isn't like my other businesses I may be chairman, but it's not my money Right, honey? Then at least listen to me Give us a minute, ladies Here's how I see it We're on the defensive here Outsiders attacking us can run and hide, but our own troops are sitting ducks for the cops If the Akashis attack after our soldiers have been rounded up, how are we going to fight back? We might have won a battle, but we?ll lose the war So what do you suggest? We all need to talk to our men and make sure they keep their cool and stay put Our strategy is to divide and conquer Divide and conquer? We'll pull their alliance to pieces I've already put the squeeze on Okubo so he can?t move Uchimoto's not likely to do anything anyway Which leaves Okajima the only one Hirono can turn to Okajima I noticed he's here tonight Fucking bastard! Comes to my club and acts all innocent! Have one of your men drag him into the office! Leave Okajima to me Could you all move? Aiko's into me for at least Yen2 million in advances, damn it! And he sneaks in here like a thieving cat to make nice with her She's supposed to be my girl, but she won?t even let me touch her pussy hair! Mr. Yamamori's here, you know Don?t worry They hit me when I'm with you and I'll die happy Don?t talk like that! You live in the same city Why do you have to be such enemies? Actually, ever since I sided with Hirono, Yamamori's been spinning his wheels and the war's been on hold Give me time and I'll mediate a truce Don?t worry Pull over You guys wait here I got to go borrow some bread from Boss Uchimoto If you're gonna see Uchimoto, I'll go with you You know Boss Uchimoto? Sure, we've been buddies since black-market days We'll be right back Who're you? Is the boss in? Tell him I wanna borrow some scratch Get lost, you fucking drunk! What do you think this is? I am not got no use for you Where's the boss? Stop! Are you crazy? That's one of the boss's legit clients, you fucking moron! Quick! Clean it up! The blood! Hose the blood away! Get out of the way, idiot! With one innocent civilian dead, and one critically wounded, SAVAGE VIOLENCE the public and the media HITS ORDINARYCITIZENS broke their frustrated silence NO MORE GUNS! And demanded police action. CITIZENS UNITE TO PROTECT OURCITY! The police established a command center GANG VIOLENCE ERADICATION COMMAND CENTER and launched a crackdown on gangs. Let me speak Witnesses should help us determine a suspect soon Aren?t you going to investigate the Uchimoto family? If it's part of a gangland feud, why aren?t you arresting Yamamori? They're making you look like monkeys! Stop pussyfooting around! No self-respecting paper can ignore this stuff We've got to hit them with blanket coverage Any crime involving a gangster gets reported, no matter how trivial Even where there's no crime, I want expos?s of their tax schemes and business rackets I want you digging deep like your life depends on it Got it? Hey, it's Hayakawa All right! Everybody come to my club! Get in! Let's go, fellas! Fucking reporter! What paper you from, you bastard? STOPTHE THUGGERY! MAKE A CLEAN SWEEP OF SENSELESS VIOLENCE! Idiots! How could you let them get that picture? What kind of moron goes prancing around when the cops and media are both on high alert? Don?t you know they?re talking about revoking my business license? Are you fucking trying to hang me or what? Hirono's the one who started this feud It's not my fucking fight! I'm flying to Tokyo to discuss the situation with Representative Kuwabara, so try to use your fucking heads while I'm gone! That block on your shoulders! How's Matsui doing? I don?t think he's got much longer A lot of good he did coming back Please just let him die in peace I need to do a little shopping Excuse me Boss Uchimoto's still got money, so he doesn't want to fight But how can we hold our heads up if we let Hayakawa walk all over us? - Fucking right! - Damn straight! Fried noodles, please And hurry - Fukuda? - I thought it was you, Mieko What you been up to? You're looking good You too It's been so long, I almost didn't recognize you It's been three years I've grown up- especially after getting rid of a fool like you Where the hell did you run off to, anyway? Did ya lose some weight? I still haven?t forgiven you for selling me to that strip joint Sorry about that I was just a foot soldier then I didn't know any better Could we have some beer over here? Bro! Hayakawa's car is parked just up the street Hayakawa? Go find out where he went I'll blow his head off But what?ll Boss Uchimoto say? The boss is in Tokyo We're just taking care of business while he's gone Let's go! I suppose you heard about that Hayakawa bastard The boss expelled him, so now he's got itchy fingers You just watch I'll show you what kind of man I've made of myself Speaking of which, you've turned into a real knockout I've got to be going Can I see you again? Sure Get your things together and move into my apartment if you want Really? Really Where's Boss Hayakawa? He went to see a friend Some of Uchimoto's men are looking for him You better go tell him not to show his face Who told you about Uchimoto's men looking for the boss? Nobody I saw them myself Did you see Fukuda? Don't be ridiculous! What're you doing? Matsui comes back to die, and this is how you treat him? Get out! So what? Hayakawa and Uchimoto have nothing to do with me! I haven't done anything wrong! What the fuck? Move it! You fucking scum! Just so you know, it's Mieko who sold you out! Serves you right! SEPTEMBER 17, 1963 YASUKI FUKUDAOF UCHIMOTO FAMILY DIED With this killing as the trigger, the rank and file of both camps set all hesitation aside and exploded in open warfare like a dam bursting. Let's get outta here! Move it! Get in! Fucking assholes! That'll teach'em! Take this, shitface! Go ahead and kill me! You better believe I'll kill you! Hey, men It's not nice to make'em suffer, so either kill'em or send'em home I'll do it Let me do it! SEPTEMBER 20, 1963 -TSUTOMU MORITA OF THE UCHIMOTO FAMILY DIED ANTl-VIOLENCE COALITION Fed up with the constant violence, the citizens of Hiroshima rose up en masse to drive violence from the city. MASARU MARUYAMA, MEMBEROF TAKEDA FAMILY, SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS As family members were flushed out of their territories, HAYAKAWA FAMILY MEMBER HIROSHI SUGIMOTO SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS the police made one arrest after another. Stop it or we'll haul you in for obstruction of justice! What are you talking about? We're just cleaning house! If you don't like it, you can move your fucking car! Meanwhile, close surveillance by the Kure police had effectively paralyzed Hirono. To make matters worse, his backers in the Akashi family had their own problems, meeting resistance from the locals MEMBEROF AKASHI FAMILY SHIGEO AIHARA as they sought a foothold in Tokyo, which left them unable to come to Hirono's aid. Seeing this, the rival Shinwa Group SECOND CHAIRMAN OF SHINWAGROUP GIICHI ITAMI installed strongman Giichi Itami as its second chairman, striving to establish a balance of power. Boss, you have a call from Takeda Takeda? That you, Takeda? What's the matter? We've been ready, but you don?t attack Look who's talking You said you'd kill Yamamori, but you haven't lifted a finger Uchimoto's ignoring you and Akashi's abandoned you Pretty pathetic So what's this? They've got you caged in, so you figured you'd call and give me grief on the phone? Fucking asshole! You're in the same boat So let me make a suggestion: Give it up and go straight I can't just take your word, so announce it to the papers Then I'll give due consideration to your circumstances Sure, I'll announce I'm giving up the life- as long as you do the same And you've got to bring Yamamori with you, too Look, Hirono Think about it At this rate, the police and press are gonna do us in for good Don?t you think? Welcome Hey, Hirono Mr. Okubo's friends on the city council tried talking to the Kure police, but the police won't pull off their cordon They won?t, huh? I wish I could be your arms and legs and help out, but Mr. Okubo absolutely forbids it Meanwhile, Yamamori's been traipsing around with no one paying him any heed He and Eda plan to attend the installment ceremony for the new Shinwa Group chairman, with a free pass from the police Money really does talk So Yamamori's going to Kobe? Say, when exactly is this installment ceremony? I'm ready What's going on? Open up! Open up! Let's go! What're you stopping for? Boss we really don?t think you should go to Kobe Me and Iwami here can ice Yamamori for you You should go on back to Kure What're you giving me grief for at a time like this? Get moving! You know, boss cut a snake in pieces, it'll recover if it keeps its head But if its head gets chewed up, then it's a goner That's why you need to stay in Kure Look, I have an 18-year grudge against Yamamori This is something I have to do with my own hand Now get this thing moving! What the fuck? Sorry, but while you two are talking, I need to go take a shit Again? You having stomach trouble? These suckers chill my stomach and give me diarrhea My stomach's feeling bad, too So it's group shit time, is it? A couple of stinking buddies, aren?t you? The snake's head, huh? Takemoto! Iwami! Where are you? Answer me! Those shitheads! SEPTEMBER 25, 1963 SHINWAGROUP INSTALLATION CEREMONY There he is I told you to give it up, you stupid punks! Sure, it'd be great to ruin the bastard's special day But our Boss Akashi will be attending, too Did you think about that? Then how about afterwards- after Boss Akashi goes home? At the station, or wherever Please just let us do it Keep your fucking hands off him in Kobe! You explain it to the knuckleheads, Iwai Fine, but I can't go back to Hirono empty-handed Isn?t there anyway we can send him some reinforcements? The boss said no So what's the excuse going to be for contradicting the boss? If you want an excuse, we've got one The plan Iwai had in mind was to hold a grand memorial service for the murdered Kiyoshi Kawanishi. Pressed by Iwai that the time for action had come, Hirono immediately began preparations for the service, along with plans to attack Hiroshima, as soon as the funeral was over. Starting several days before the scheduled service, men from the Akashi family and other families across the country began arriving in Kure in droves, soon reaching some 1,600 in number. Hey there Did you wait long? I hear things are kind of touchy right now Is it wise to always meet in the same place? This place is safe because my men have a clear view out front Coffee Besides, even in wartime, a guy needs a break now and then I said coffee Keep it quiet Come with us Yo, Uchimoto A fine sight you are! You spend so much time chasing pussy, it's made you soft Please don't harm me I'm the one's been telling my men to stay outfights, yet the men who've been killed are all my men Still want to save your hide, do you? Okay, I'll let you off But first you'll have to give us a nice little show with your girlfriend Hurry it up Get your clothes off You can?t mean it! Take their picture, Eda, and we'll send it to the Akashis Have a heart Go get a camera Boss Yamamori, I don?t care about myself, but please don't torment this man It would be too cruel a blow if his wife found out about us I beg you Two-bit whores should mind their own business! Only two-bit toughs have to get their man when he's with his lady! Enough fucking lip! Just you watch this! Hold on, Eda Kill him and all you do is make yourself the next target That's no reason to let him go alive! That's right Do it! Sit down Boss so long as this fuck's alive, we have a chance to make peace Knock him off, and who're you gonna make peace with? If what you want is all-out war, that's fine with me, too But I can?t take responsibility for what might happen So tell us, Uchimoto Hirono's planning a big fancy memorial service for Kawanishi, but I'm guessing it's just a front for launching an attack on us Am I right? Spill it! Save your neck, dear Tell him All right, then Let's hear the whole story KNOCKOUTVIOLENCE BUILD A LIVABLE COMMUNITY To all Hirono family members, we have you completely surrounded Do exactly as we say, or you?ll be arrested for obstructing justice Shozo Hirono, we have a warrant for your arrest Come out peacefully I repeat: We have you surrounded Do exactly as we say, or you will be arrested for obstructing justice Shozo Hirono, we have a warrant for your arrest Come out peacefully Boss, we'll hold them off You get out of here! There's a time for everything What happens, happens You've got to save yourself, boss You know it's just some unrelated offense - I'll be back in no time - Boss! Put that hardware away! No sense letting them confiscate it Hirono, the charge is assault and battery I see Last summer you dragged a Makihara family member to the Yamamori office and worked him over Is that right? Supposedly Yamamori's the only one who knows about that So he's your snitch, is he? Come with us This is a waste of tax money Boss! Boss! Hirono was arrested for an unrelated offense, but it effectively removed him from the field of battle. Three days later, the service was held without him, and the troops who'd gathered in Kure left without seeing action. Yamamori and Makihara promptly returned to Kure. With the tables now turned, bloody retribution followed against members of Hirono's family. We've got company! Run! OCTOBER3, 1963 MASUO IWAMI CRITICALLYWOUNDED Stop it! SHIGERU TAKEMOTO OF HIRONO FAMILY SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS The fuck! - Give me my fucking money! - Let me go! I want my money, damn it! Stop it! What the fuck's going on? I had Yen1,000 riding on that home run! Fucking bastard claims I only get Yen500 back! I calculated it right! Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm with the Gisei Group Got a problem with that? Yazaki you doing this all on your own? Uh-huh To stay under the cops' radar You'll never last if you let them give you shit Here, take this Anybody complains, teach him a lesson Thanks I sure didn?t figure on Hirono getting hauled in It changes the whole picture in our war with Yamamori Takeda's trying to stop bleeding money by sending home all the troops from outside Since Uchimoto's obviously useless, how about you and I join up for a showdown with Yamamori? I don't have the troops for a fight We got our hands full just collecting baseball bets Used to be Uchimoto took care of us, but lately he's just been squeezing our balls So I don?t figure I owe him a thing anymore I'd heard a little something about that, so I brought you this to tide you over-Yen5 million I'd like you to take it I don?t owe a thing to either Uchimoto or Akashi, but if we just let them keep pounding Hirono's men, then you know they'll come after us next That's why I'm asking for your help Please I'll do what I can You've taken on a new glow since coming to this bar Then maybe I should break up with Okajima and play the field again Good idea! I'll be your first candidate Time to trade in for a new model But seriously, I can?t thank you enough, Mr. Takeda If I'd stayed where I was, Boss Yamamori would have hounded me out of Hiroshima If Okajima realized I owe it all to you, I just know he wouldn't go on standing against you But promise me you won?t tell him I got you this gig I wouldn?t want him to take it wrong Just be sure you call me every day to tell me where he is I need to know so I can protect him There's too many guys angling to knock him off I will Well, if it isn't Okajima! How long has it been? Join us! Sit down! Where've you been keeping yourself? Here, have a drink! How've you been? What've you guys been up to? Welcome These are friends of mine from grade school My goodness! You know, Okazaki, we should have a class reunion We can invite old "Knuckle Trumpet" Who in the world is that? Our teacher Bottoms up! Hello? Takeda? Just a moment Boss, there's a call from that Aiko who used to work for you She's asking if Takeda's here Aiko? Tell her you?re one of Takeda's men See what she has to say KABE HOT SPRINGS, HIROSHIMA You used to rap me on the head with your knuckles You said only the reformatory could straighten me out Did he really? So I turned into a reprobate, but do you suppose I've straightened out just a little? I think my face just turned red Watch your step, sir You don't need to treat me like a doddering old man yet Hello there - You're Okajima, I believe? - That's right Believe it You saw it OCTOBER 11, 1963 -TOMOJI OKAJIMA, CHAIRMAN OF GISEl GROUP, DIED Takeda flew into a rage when he heard of Yamamori's unilateral action. Takeda knew there could be no winning if the public was against them, and his bitter differences with the hawkish Yamamori and Eda led him to pull back from the forefront of the feud. Meanwhile, the opposing Uchimoto spurned Iwai's repeated calls for action, needlessly delaying resolution of the hostilities. So are you going to take Yamamori out or not, damn it! The thing is, with Hirono away, if I take on Yamamori all by myself, there's no way I can win What kind of talk is that from a yakuza? Or are you just a cab company owner? Which do you wanna be? Well, if I have to choose, I'd really just like to focus on my business now Fine Do what you like We've got no use for a cab company, so you?ll just have to walk your own path But I'm warning you You've got a precipice ahead and a precipice behind I suggest you watch your step very carefully Right? Doesn?t what I said make good sense? You guys hang in there now - Boss! - Mr. Uchimoto Bro! For a time the feud seemed to be dying down, but the flames flared up again when the younger men in the various families grew disgruntled with their bosses' political maneuverings. OCTOBER 15, 1963 "HAREM" CABARET BOMBED Take cover! THAT SAME NIGHT- EDA FAMILYOFFICE BOMBED WAR ESCALATES TO BOMBINGS CABARET BOMBED Is this the police? What? This is Yoshio Yamamori What you mean, "What's up?" I keep calling to ask for protection, and you guys don't do squat! Bombs are flying, and I've got no place to hide! It's your job to protect upstanding citizens! If I get killed, it's on your shoulders! Ouch! So, where are you right now? All right Stay where you are What does he want? Wants to know-how refuse to protect an upstanding citizen Is he kidding? You shouldn?t even be taking his calls Until we can bring charges, we have to treat him like anybody else Boss Yamamori called the police, so you guys can scram Are you sure? He's got more faith in the cops than in us Enough of this shit Go Yamamori's hiding out with Eda at Hayakawa's bar - You sure? - No question about it And Hayakawa and his men split, so now's our chance - All right Let's go gate?s - Right! Follow me! Yeah, it's me And? Going after Yamamori? Hurry it up! Takeda here Yeah, what's up? I'm telling you this 'cause I owe you one for the other day Some of my men just rushed out, saying they were going to ice Yamamori They were headed for Hayakawa's bar You better call him and warn him right away Idiot! Why didn?t you stop them? Why should I have to stop them? We're at war! Look, if Yamamori survives, could you get him to lend me Yen20 million or so? What moron lends money to his enemy, you dimwit? - What gives, Takeda? - Ueda! What made you think you could protect the boss here without any defenses? What're you talking about? There's a police cruiser outside None that I see Go look Takeda, I trust Ueda, and my life is in his hands I have no use for you Is that so? In that case, when the Uchimoto fellas show up in a minute, you can fight them off yourselves Hold on! I'll go with you Come if you want, but am I your man for this fight or not? I never said you weren't Not that way! This way! This way! Move it! Drive! Cops! Clear the road! Let me go! Run! - Who the hell are you? - You're with Uchimoto! Take it easy! Stop it! We're in the same boat here Fucking asshole! You're lucky you got away Damn straight What happened was the car broke down, so everybody got out to push You pushed, too? Yeah But then when I stopped to think, I realized, why should I be helping them? So I ran away. What a moron! But you know what Takeda said? It was Boss Uchimoto who squawked about our raid - The boss himself? - Uh-huh No wonder we?re always being taken for fools! That pisses me off! Let's attack again! Yeah, let's hit them again! Uchimoto's goons are walking the streets again Fucking bastards! Let's go get them! Where ya think you're going, punks? Get lost, you fucking assholes! Just try and make us, shithead! Fucking bastard! OCTOBER 17, 1963 -GUN BATTLE IN SHINTENCHI 2 DEAD, 3 CRITICALLYWOUNDED The wild gun battle directly threatened ordinary citizens, and anti-gang sentiment boiled over among the public. Pressured from every direction, the police and district attorney began rounding up all family leaders. What kind of treatment is this? - Boss! - What? Get in! UCHIMOTO & CO KAWAHATA HOSPITAL No! Don't do that! Stop! - Out of my way! - What's this about? Yamamori, I have a warrant for your arrest! What possible charge could you bring against me? Two years ago, you punched an employee of the Boat Racing Association I have Potts disease I have to stay off my feet Go ask the doctor The only thing keeping you off your feet is too much pussy! The reporters are here too, dear, so act like a man! Leave me alone! Have you completely lost your spine? Come with us Just give me a second! I'll hold a press conference As soon as he learned of Yamamori?s arrest, Iwai flew to Hiroshima to begin rebuilding the Akashi camp there, centering on the Gisei Group's henchmen left leaderless by Okajima's death. Meanwhile, Takeda made peace with his former enemy, Otomo, and called on other Hiroshima families to unite in common purpose and meet Iwai's challenge head-on. The yakuza in this city feel a certain pride The Shinwa Group from Kobe wants us to raise their banner here, but we?ve turned them down Stay here yourself as long as you want, but take down the Akashi family sign Hold on a second I belong to the Akashi family Why shouldn't I put up their sign wherever I am? In that case, declare right here and now that you'll break off with the Gisei Group When you come in here and open an office with these guys, you're meddling in internal Hiroshima affairs And what kind of satisfaction can we expect for the murdered Okajima? This is war! Killing's the name of the game! Then you'll be our next target, so fucking bring it on! Anytime, asshole! - Anytime! - Calm down Do I take what you said as your family?s official answer? I'm Iwai of the Akashi family All right Then just so you know, we may not be very sophisticated here in Hiroshima, but we never let visitors stand upwind of us We won't let so much as a cat get through if he's from Kobe Don't forget that Fine You guys take care your spit doesn't blow in your own faces Got that? Now get out of here! Handle this with care Just make sure no harm comes to Boss Akashi It'd make things too messy Otherwise, blow up whatever you like Just be careful Right TATSUO AKASHI OCTOBER 20, 1963 BOSS AKASHI'S RESIDENCE BOMBED The Akashi family assumed SHINWAGROUP they'd been attacked by the Shinwa Group and retaliated immediately. THAT SAME NIGHT- SHINWAGROUP OFFICE ATTACKED The fire jumped to Hiroshima the very same night, and gun battles erupted between Takeda's and Iwai's men. THAT SAME NIGHT- TAKEDAOFFICE ATTACKED Get him to a hospital! Don't just stand there Start cleaning up And so the feud in Hiroshima grew into a battle between Hiroshima and Kobe, a bloodletting that shook all of Western Japan. OCTOBER 21, 1963 BOSS OF YOSHIKURA FAMILYATTACKED Stop! Fucking bastard! OCTOBER 22, 1963 BOSS OF HAYAKAWA FAMILYATTACKED Iwai and his troops from Kobe are putting themselves out there If we let outsiders do all the work, how can we ever lift our heads high again? We're gonna join the battle Could you send your men out too? You're barking up the wrong tree I owe my loyalty to Uchimoto When Uchimoto's sitting tight, I can't go joining fights on my own I understand your position, but Boss Okajima was counting on you That's why he gave you that money - You owe him - Let's not bring money into this It's true I owe Okajima, but as repayment, I've been sending part of my take to him every month You think money can repay your obligation? You guys brought it up first! Calm down Look, Kawada, if you join the fight, so will Uchimoto Whether we can avenge Boss Okajima is on your shoulders You can make men of us Please! Bro I'll go talk to Uchimoto, so don?t worry about it, okay? Move it! - Bro! - Listen to me Don't get itchy trigger fingers until we have a clear answer from Kawada Forget that bastard, bro We can do it ourselves I don't intend to die without avenging Okajima's death Kawada's a little strange Don't get on his bad side or you?ll regret it later I won't last much longer Bro! HOWTO BUILD A BOMB GUNPOWDER Hello I see All right I have to go That was Boss Kawada He hit it! All right! Now we?re sitting pretty today There you are, Yazaki You've been helping out Fujita over at the Gisei Group a lot Why don?t you give it up? But I owe Mr. Fujita a debt of gratitude For what? Those guys think they've got one up on us, and they've been cutting into our territory The gas stations are all showing Gisei Group badges That may be true, but if there?s a war, we have to side with Gisei Think again I'm not siding with anyone What are we so broken up about that we should have to help Gisei? Leave the war to the warmongers Our first concern is protecting our turf You know, Yazaki, it'd sure simplify things if you'd do him for us Excuse me? Fujita's in line to be the next chairman of the Gisei Group Without him, Gisei's got about as much going for it as a pile of horseshit This here is how much those bastards rake off our take With Fujita gone, this would all be yours Think about it I know you?ve kind of become friends, so if you can't do it, you can't do it But you know, Yazaki, don?t you think it's time to start acting like a man? An opportunity like this may not come again MOTOMACHI IN HIROSHIMA AKA"THE A-BOMB SLUMS" Turn the television off It's giving me a headache I told you to turn it off, you numbskull! Get up, Hiroshi! How long are you going to lie around and not work? Get up! Hurry up and eat your dinner I'll buy you a better TV More big talk! Who's there? Yazaki? What're you doing here at this hour? Bro! OCTOBER 25, 1963 SHOICHI FUJITAOF GISEl GROUP DIED What's going on? Where's your son? Has he done something? He's wanted for murder - There he is! - This way! Stop! HIROSHI YAZAKI OF KAWADA FAMILY SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS Hirono Iwai Hirono the Gisei Group's Fujita got offed Fujita? Yep Some punk from the Kawada family did it It's brother killing brother now The Gisei Group's in tatters, and I have no idea how to fix it And that's not all The family in Kobe accepted police mediation and made peace with the Shinwa Group I've been called home Hirono I hate to do this, but I have to pull out I'm really sorry I'm the one who should apologize I understand how you feel I appreciate everything you've done I just saw Uchimoto too, and he said it was a relief to get thrown in the clink That's about what I'd expect of him Hey So long, then The world may be changing, but there?s more to life than just Kure and Hiroshima You should plan to come to Kobe I'll be waiting for you I'll be counting on it You want to stay a yakuza or turn legitimate businessman? Which is it going to be? I'm sure you're aware we can cancel your business license I've been thinking about that for a long time But when you're out there in yakuza society, you have to live with your shields up So I couldn?t say anything, you know Are you going to disband or not? That's why I'm saying! Since being in here, I've finally made up my mind All right? Regarding the charges of tax evasion and illegal possession of firearms, I'm negotiating with the prosecutors, so the less you say, the better But try not to be so contrary Maybe they'll let you out sooner The city's talking about taking over the boat-racing business for a billion yen We'll be set for the rest of our lives You can turn everything over to a successor Here's your asthma medicine Asthma? Hey, this medicine sure works great! Iwai left this for you Bosses like you get to feast on fancy food, but all the grunts get is prison garbage Poor bastards When you're a yakuza, only the boss gets the perks Even in war, they don't lift a finger The grunts do all the dirty work Truth is, they're probably afraid of dying We live by a different code! Shut the fuck up if you don't know! - Don't give me that rap! - Oh, yeah? If you cared a damn about your men, you'd be the first to die! Soon, Hirono's parole was revoked, and he was sent to Hiroshima prison. The following January, he was re-sentenced to seven years and four months in prison. Hirono How long they put you away for? Seven years and four months, including what I had before Is that right? Not much different from some murder sentences Who knows? By the time they figure in the Kobe bombing and whatnot, I might be in longer than you Yeah? Eda got five years, and Makihara got about three Uchimoto got off with probation What about Yamamori? A year and a half He gets one and a half and I get seven I sure got the short end of the stick there I blew everything I had, so I'm penniless now And the papers have pounded me so ruthlessly, only way I can survive is to turn my organization into a political committee I suppose that might be fine, but it looks to me like our time is over Do this for 18 years, you grow used to certain comforts, but the cold in here really gets to my bones No kidding Somehow I've got to find a way to get through seven years of this Well, then, Hirono, you hang in there Yeah, you too And so the Hiroshima feud that led to 17 dead, 26 wounded, and some 1,500 arrests came to its fruitless end, and the gangland violence soon disappeared beneath an increasingly stable public order. But this is not to say that violence itself, nor the societal contradictions that drive people to it, have disappeared from the world around us. THE END
