Come on. Come on. This is ridiculous. I'm gonna freeze my hands off before I get this thing lit. You gotta be smarter than the stove. When we get back to town, I'm gonna find that guy in the camping store and light him up. Here. Try this. Thanks. - Cool. - Be prepared. And keep your voice down. Hello, Bambi. Let me see. - Hang on a second. - Let me see! He's beautiful. It's gonna be beautiful on my wall. What the heck was that? That's impossible. What are we gonna do? We came up here for a trophy... and that, my friend... is a trophy. Stand still, you son of a... Bob. I think we'd better get out of here. Where are you going? Rocky! Wait! Rocky! No, no, no! Rocky! Come on, man. Talk to me! Where the hell are you? No... No! Oh, no! Three hundred dollar cell phone, and I can't get a signal. It's not your phone, Chad, it's these mountains. I lost my signal an hour ago. How am I supposed to call anyone? I'm sure your mommy will be fine without you. You can e-mail her a love note when we get to the lodge. Good luck. I heard this place isn't on the 'Net. This lodge has got the Internet, but you're not gonna use it. I can't believe my dad agreed to this. All the money he puts in this team-- we should be going someplace like Aspen, not this dump. - You want to go to the Olympics? - I am going to the Olympics. - Not the way you've been training. - Excuse me? There's a hundred guys across this country that would love to take your spot on this team. That's why we're not going to Aspen. For the next two weeks, all you're gonna do is ski. No cell phone, no Internet, no cable TV... just powder. And do you know what the best part of this is? It's your father's idea. Get a lift ticket! Coach, you made it! Listen, I know I promised you'd have this place to yourself, - but some people came up. - We'll work around the tourists. I'm just happy to be here. I'm not. This is quite a crowd you got here! We can turn these people into champions. - I am a champion. - Chad. You're Chad Brown, right? I read about you. Nationals last year. That was sweet stuff. But didn't Hanson pull out at the last second? Kind of taints the victory when your number-one rival stays home, doesn't it? Let's get everything off the bus. Let's go on in. You guys can check out the runs. Give me that. Let's go. - This is great! - Everybody's excited. All right, guys, come on in here. We'll get you dialed in with some rooms. - Thanks, Johnny. - No worries, man. Follow me. Rooms are off to the right. You have Dash Dashiell working up here? He's my right-hand man. I used to coach him. Didn't he take the nationals in '97? - That guy killed it in the '90s. - That dude was totally awesome. Lost Mountain may be a small resort, but we got the best ski instructors in the world up here. No, no, knees bent. - Come on, Mrs. Stewart. - I got it! Bend your knees. Low center of gravity. Okay. Mrs. Stewart, it's like this. It's like a slice of pizza. Pepperoni or sausage? Right now I wish it was Hawaiian. You guys forget everything I say ten seconds after I say it. You guys are never gonna learn to ski unless you start taking this more seriously. Same time tomorrow? Yeah, as long as you promise not to yell at us, Dad. Good-bye, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart. Bye! You know what would be good? A rum toddy. That's a good idea. Is Frank around? No, he's upstairs checking in the Olympic dudes. - The Olympic dudes? - Yeah. They got a long way to go before you can call 'em that. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Doc. Another busy day at the office? Another crappy day. - Yeah, paperwork sucks. - I know that feeling. I'm up to my eyeballs in paperwork right about now. What do you guys do up there at the lab, anyway? It's all very technical. You wouldn't understand it even if I explained it. What, because I'm a ski bum, a dumb jock? Why not? You are. I didn't mean anything like that. It's okay. It's all right. What brings you out in the sun today? Ski lesson, maybe? I'm free for the next couple of hours. Thank you, but I'm all finished. I really appreciate it, but I'm pretty busy. I was expecting some mail. Did anything come for me? - Yeah. - Dude, I got it. It's here somewhere. Don't you guys get your mail up there at the lab? Yeah, but this is personal stuff. I don't want a bunch of civil servants looking at presents from my mom. It's a college of biology. Your mom's into all that intellectual stuff, too? Yeah, she's a researcher, like me. Mostly retired now. Anyway, thank you for this. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. So, you really are working here now. I'm sorry. Do I know you? You really are Dash Dashiell! I thought you, like, died or something. He looks alive to me. No, I'm Dash, and I'm still alive. Doesn't feel like it in the morning sometimes, though. My dad shot video of you in '98. You were awesome! And weren't you gonna do the Olympics and win a gold medal? What happened with that? It was a wipe-out, stupid. It was gnarly. Gnarly, all right. I'd just come off my second nationals, and I thought I could do anything. Guess I was wrong. Broke my leg in the Olympic trials, and that was it. Why didn't you make a comeback? Maybe "broke" was the wrong word. Shattered was more like it. Took four operations and a pound of titanium before I could walk straight. Two and a half years before I could even strap on skis. Yeah. The bones healed up all right, though. No one wanted to take a chance on the ligaments and tendons. That's rough, man. I lost my sponsors, my school scholarship, car... Team America moved on to find their next hero. - That sucks. - Yeah, that sucks big time. And now you're teaching poseurs on a bunny slope. Awesome. Better be careful, son. I can still shred. - You sure about that? - Leave him alone, Chad. Why don't you race me down the diamond and find out, Junior? You got it, Pops. I'll see you at the top. Dash, you don't have to prove anything to me or anyone else. No offense, Doc, but I'm not doing it for you. You gotta teach these kids to respect their elders. And besides, I already impress you. All right, this is good. Call it, Gomer. One...two, three! You little cheater! Coming through, Junior! See you later, old man! Oh, man. Oh, my God, that jump! I couldn't believe it. That was some sweet carving by you too, man. You tore that to shreds! That was a nice run, kid, but you should leave the glade skiing alone. Might eat a tree, miss your shot at the gold medal like I did. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. - That was so bitchin'! - Totally hit that landing! We were both freakin' out down here! So, does he remind you of anyone? No. I was a much better skier when I was his age. And not nearly as arrogant, I bet. I prefer the word "confident." Oh, okay. Well, it's been fun watching you alpha males fight for dominance, but I should get back to work now. Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to do too, but... you want to go out to dinner sometime? I could show you my scars. Oh, thank you. But seriously, I'm completely swamped right now. Okay. I'll see you next mail call. Guard him! Hey, Doc! Let's go! Way to go, Dash. You are so smooth. "I can show you my scars"-- what kind of a line is that, you moron?! Hey, Dash, got a minute? I got nothin' but time, Frank. The Stewarts came to see me after the lesson this morning. Let me guess. They want another instructor. They like you fine. They said you're a credit to the resort. Really. They also said you should get the stick out of your you-know-what before you step on it and hurt something important. I know I'm a bit uptight, but they just won't listen. I know skiing is your life, but it's not theirs. They just want to have fun. They don't care about races. There's more to it than just being the first one to cross the finish line. You keep talking like that and they're gonna take away your coaching license. - You never listen to me anyway. - You got that right. Looks like the rangers got a problem. Now the forecast for the Logan County area. We have a freeze warning issued by the National Weather Service. There's a low-pressure center retreating very rapidly. All the moisture that's pushed with it is going to allow that cold air to come in right behind. There's gonna be a lot of precipitation on the ground. It will freeze--no chance to evaporate or soak in. Road conditions will be treacherous, and that should start around 5:00 this afternoon. And how about those Logan County Bobcats? This team is really rolling. They're up for the regional championship this week. The hunters were last seen up on North Ridge, so I've narrowed it down to this area right here. Two nights in the mountains isn't so bad. You said they had wilderness training, right? Supposed to be home last night. Said their wives would kill 'em if they missed church this morning. If you could spare Dash, we could find 'em in a few hours. - That's a lot of ground to cover. - It's mostly on Grizzly Flats. It's not like we're gonna do any mountain climbing. Hurry back, 'cause I got a resort to run. I wouldn't ask if all the rangers weren't out with the flu. Okay, but be careful. Sometimes nature strikes back. Somebody's got some serious explaining to do. Joseph? David? Oh, God! - My leg. - Where are you? Somebody took my legs. Oh, my God. - My leg, my leg... - Oh, my God. Joseph. - Oh, my God! - She's hungry! She's hungry. Joseph. She's hungry. Coming back! Oh, my God. Get out! She's coming back! She's hungry! I'm not going anywhere without you. Tell me what happened. Feeding... They...ran out of food. They broke loose. They went crazy. That can't be! There's enough food here for weeks! It's all gone. Joseph, hold on! Hold on! Took my legs... - She took my legs! - Oh, Joseph! Just hold on. Oh, Joe. Oh, Joseph. Oh, Joe. Thanks for helping out, Dash. Anything for the government. So, is your name really Rick? That's right. And you are a forest ranger? Yes. Wouldn't that make you Ranger Rick? You'd think a guy with a name like Dash would be a little more sensitive to funny names. - You'd think so, wouldn't you? - It's a hunch. How did these guys get a permit to hunt up here? I thought this was restricted land. Well, it was, till they shut down all the military posts the last few years. Now they aren't quite as strict. If it wasn't for the weather lab taking over the base, there wouldn't be anyone up here but you ski bums. You ever seen the inside of that place? No, but not for lack of trying. The professor's a real piece of work. What about Doc Sommers? You ever seen her? What about her? I just wondered if you knew anything about her, that's all. I know she's smart. And hot. She's all right. What, have you got snow blindness now? Pass! Come on, pass! - Foul! - I had position! It's your call, Captain. Foul or no foul? - No foul. - Told ya! Playtime's over. Load the truck. Let's go! Start loading. Gear up. Meet me at the truck on the double! - Hurry up! - Let's go! Right behind ya! Officer Donnegan, do you copy? Over. Jones, can you hear me? Over! - Baker, what's going on? - Unknown. Alarm sounded at the lab, but communication is out. Isn't Dr. Sommers supposed to be there? She passed by about twenty minutes ago. - I'm sure there's nothing wrong. - We're about to find out. Looks like their truck. Yep. At least we got a place to start. Plates are a match. - You see anything? - A lot of snow and a lot of trees. Saddle up. I'll take the east ridge. You take the west. This shouldn't take long. You see anything, give me a call. Got it. All clear, sir. We got some blood over here. Chao, cut the alarm. We're gonna have to check out the lab. You said we'd never have to go down there. - Yeah, Cap. I hate spiders. - This is not a democracy, boys. The subjects are all in their cages. Besides, this is probably nothing more than a short-circuited alarm system. I hope you're right. All right, one more thing. Remember, this is a special access program, so if you even talk in your sleep about what you see down there, you'll be brought up on charges of treason. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Let's move out. Be ready for anything. Let's go, Professor. Oh, man. Rick, be advised, we might have some wolves around, maybe even a bear. Did you say bear? Grizzly, I'd say. Might be rabid. Bears should be hibernating still. Whatever it was sure made a mess of this elk. Roger that. Look, the eastern ridge is clear, so I'm gonna make my way back over to you. Sounds like it might be better to stick together. Copy that. This way. Let's go. Rick...I found your hunter. All right, give me a flare. Comin' up. I see ya. Go! Go! Go! Let's go. Keep moving. - How could this have happened? - Just stop! Get in the lab! Check for survivors. Professor Marks! The black widow is still out there! She's long gone. They're all gone. You can come out now. Give me some information, people! Sir, we got two bodies! Two technicians! We have to get more soldiers and contain this whole area. These are all the soldiers we're going to get, Doctor. - It's not enough. Call in back-up! - We are the back-up. According to the world, this place doesn't exist. You knew that when you signed up. When the spiders get down the mountain, the world's gonna find out! These men can handle it. What are you talking about?! Take a look! They went through my whole staff like they were nothing! We're not a bunch of defenseless lab techs. But we can now see what they're capable of. This conversation is over. We will handle this situation by ourselves. I don't want to hear another word. - Sandstrom! - Don't shoot! He's dead already! Open fire! He's up in the air conditioning system! Fire, fire, fire! - Get him! - I can't find him! Sandstrom, can you hear me? Help him, Cap! There's nothing I can do. They're not supposed to be that big! I don't know anything about that, but keep your eyes open 'cause there's five more around here somewhere. Five more? We got lucky with that last one. Let's go. Come on. We gotta find those others and kill 'em! Kill? No, no, no. We need to capture them. It took years of research to get the program this far. I can't believe you are saying this! This program saves lives. So the end justifies the means? Precisely. And besides... no one else is going to die. If there were another spider in there, it would have attacked us by now, which means they're outside. - I thought spiders didn't like the cold. - Exactly. Well, they don't-- not even larger ones. We'll probably find them hibernating 50 feet outside the ventilation shaft. How can you be certain after all the genetic tinkering and cellular grafts? We did nothing to make them immune to sub-zero temperatures. Why don't you do us a favor and just stay out of this until the subjects are recovered? Then we'll debrief. Fine. What are you waiting for? Let's go, men. Oh, my God. I thought it was a grizzly, but these wounds don't make sense. There's tissue that's soft. It's almost like it's...melted. - Did you touch him? - I touched it, but I was careful. I wanna make sure everything's clean for the medical examiner. The medical examiner. Yeah, this might be a crime scene. Like a CSI murder and stuff. Yeah, Rick... but their equipment's a lot cooler than ours. Come on, snap out of it. We gotta find this guy's partner and get back to a phone. All right, let's go find him. Ready? I'm locked and loaded. You accelerated the growth rate. "The end justifies the means." Right. Let's go. What? - What are those, man? - Cocoons. Really...big cocoons. Right. - Rick. - Yeah? Come look at this. What the--? Looks like... it's like a spider web, or maybe a silkworm. Spiders do not come out in the winter. And they couldn't cover up a whole human being like that! It's getting cold out here, don't you think? Yeah, I think it's time to head back. Yeah. What the--? Dash, help me! I got you, Rick! - No! Come on, man! - Hang on! No! You've got to be kidding me! There's no signs of tracks, Cap! - Well? - Nothing. Not a trace. They must have a higher resistance to the cold than I thought. Or maybe the doc was right. In spite of what the doctor may think, the subjects haven't gone far. I should know. I created them. Even so, they're obviously more active than we thought. I'm gonna break out the containment gear. Just in case. Whatever you feel you have to do. Just find them before the civilians happen upon them. Stevens. Andrews. Let's go. How fast could one man be? Not as fast as Dash was this morning, and he's, like, 100 years old. I still won. That's all that matters. - Not to the Olympic committee. - Let me worry about them. Hey, guys! - Hey, Coach! - What's going on? Quitting time. One last run before dark. We'll meet you at the bottom. I'll give you a head start, race you down the mountain. Loser buys dinner. You're on. Oh, no! Hey, Doc, what's the rush? Frank, how many people are still here? It's the end of the season. I got the staff, the ski team--why? We have to evacuate everyone. - Are you kidding? - There's no time to explain. We have to get everyone off this mountain now. - Run! They're killing everyone! - Too late! Tell me I'm hallucinating. It's happening for real. We gotta help these people! Everyone get inside! Get back to the lodge! Come on, let's go! Come on! Hurry! Come on, we've got to get out of here! You didn't say anything about spiders! - Get out of here! - Oh, my God! - This is out of control! - Those things are eating everybody. What are they? Giant spiders. What do they look like? Like in the movies with the bugs and the radiation. - I wonder if Dash made it out. - And Coach Palmer. Close this! Was there anyone else still alive out there? Just Frank. He was right behind us. Get inside! Lock it, Johnny! - What are we going to do? - Stay here until they leave. - We gotta get to the lodge. - Look, it's Otto! He's going for the bus. - They're not gonna make it. - No, he's gonna make it. No way. - No, no, no! - Oh, my God! - We have to get out of here. - No. We gotta stay here. Did you see what happened to Otto? Is everybody okay? Get us out of here. Is everybody ready to make a run for it? Let's go! Go! Everybody follow me! Come on! Get in! Get in! - Help me find the keys! - Hold the door! - I think Otto still has them. - This was your big idea! Maybe there's a spare set. Forget the keys. Calm down and be quiet. We can hide out here till help comes. Come on, Mom, answer the phone! Get everything heavy. It's not pretty, but it should hold. - The phone's dead. - What? This is totally not cool. Try the radio. - We need to get Otto's set. - Maybe they're over here. We're screwed! It doesn't look like he's bringing them to us. Then someone's gonna have to go get them. What? - You're the fastest. - And this was your idea. Fine. I'll go. It's not safe out there. Once we get this thing started, we're out of here. You can do it, man. Come on! Watch out, Chad. Just get the keys, man! Chad, don't look back! You got him by a mile! - Hurry! - Come on! This isn't brain surgery! Drive! Drive! - Good work! - Thanks, Coach! - Not so fast. - Slow down! You slow down. I'm getting out of here! There's ice right there! I'm gonna throw it off! - What the heck is Dash doing? - Trying to get in, you idiot. Open the door! Come on. Help me. Push. Thanks. Mayday, mayday. Lost Mountain Resort for Bigsby Ranger Station-- Save the batteries. There's nobody at the ranger station. - They're all out sick. - They're our only hope, man. What's wrong with the phone? The phones are down. I already tried. - Dash! - What are you doing down here? You were with Rick. Where is he? Has he gone for help? No, actually, Doc... he didn't make it. I'm so sorry. We were up at Grizzly Flats. We got attacked by two of those things. Where's Frank? - I don't know. - We don't know. How did you get stuck up here? Why do you think she's down here? Those spiders came from her secret lab. Is that true? Listen, try the lab. Maybe the military is monitoring civilian frequencies. - I tried. Nobody home. - Try it again. - The military? - I couldn't tell you before. I signed a non-disclosure agreement. When does the non-disclosure cavalry get here? I wouldn't count on them for any help. Of course not. Listen up, everybody. Listen up, guys. Okay. We seem to be pretty safe for now. The phones are down and nobody's answering the radio, but we're still trying. If we want to survive, we have to work together. - Okay? - Who put you in charge? Those things out there and 12 years in the marines, unless you want the job. No. You seem to be doing a good job. What could we do to help? Check food supplies. We're cut off from the kitchen, but check the bar. There's some stuff behind there. The rest of you double and triple check the doors and windows. All right? Come on... so we don't get eaten alive. - I'm going to check the generator. - I'm going with you. Are you okay? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm-- Oh, gosh. Oh, wow. What happened? What happened? You almost killed us, that's what happened. - You should have let Coach drive. - Shut up, dude. This was your fault in the first place! I was the only one coming up with ideas! Both of you, shut up. We gotta make the best of this situation, and it's not gonna happen if we're all arguing. Is everybody all right? Yeah, we're all right. I guess. - Well, that's something. - Where's Steven? - Steven! - Steve, get up! Steve, can you hear me, man? - Hey, wake up. - Is he alive? I'll check his pulse. It's weak. He's going into shock. We've gotta get him warmed up. - Is he gonna be all right? - At least he's breathing. - This is not good. - Give me your jacket. What else can we do? We gotta get him back to the infirmary at the lodge. We're gonna have to carry him. I don't think it's gonna let us leave. Just what were you guys doing up at that lab? Look... that's classified-- need-to-know basis only. There's dead people outside, so I think I need to know. - I'm not at liberty-- - Doc... if you know anything about those things, you need to tell me. You gotta tell me now. Okay. A few years ago... the Department of Defense confiscated the fossilized remains of a prehistoric arachnae they found in Afghanistan. They sent the remains to us for further study. So you thawed these things out from a Himalayan glacier? No. Nothing so dramatic as that. We just salvaged some of the mitochondrial DNA and spliced it into modern spiders. A few years of tinkering with genetic switches gave us those creatures out there. So let me guess. You guys plan on using these things as some kind of new, fancy biological weapons system. - Am I right? - No. Our experiments were geared towards defensive purposes. Spider silk is an amazing material with unlimited industrial uses. It's stronger than steel, lighter than composites, with incredible elasticity. We were building bulletproof armor, non-lethal weapons. The problem had always been getting enough silk to work with. So you just grew 'em bigger to get more webs. Yeah. We force-fed them hormones and steroids and high-caloric food and grew them bigger than genetic manipulation alone ever could. Kind of like doping up athletes to win races. Giant spiders with 'roid rage. Nice experiment, Doc. Most scientists just play around with mice. We took precautions. The lab was put up here on purpose. Spiders are susceptible to cold temperatures, so this was the perfect spot to contain them. That worked out well. Did you ever think about what might happen if it started to warm up? How many of these things are up here, anyway? Six. They all look basically the same, except we infused each one with a dominant genetic profile from a different species so we could study their unique silk. Okay, look, - we can take this thing. - We're smarter than it is. What's it doing? It's obviously trying to get in so it can eat us. It's freaking me out. Where did it go? Okay, be quiet. I think it's getting bored. Do they have any weaknesses? Each one has the traits of its dominant DNA. For instance, the one in the lab... she's basically black widow-- reclusive, sneaky-- she stayed behind while the others broke out. And there's one that's based on the spitting spider, with a very unique web. Then there's Dorian-- smart, aggressive, a relentless hunter. - Wait a minute. - He's 95% jumping spider. You guys actually have pet names for these things? Look...that doesn't matter, and their dominant genes might not matter anymore, either. Those things aren't the creatures I set out to breed. What? They weren't supposed to get that big. About a month ago, I noticed the subjects were growing faster and bigger than they should, so I sent blood samples to a colleague for testing. The results didn't make any sense until I got back to the lab this morning. Turns out Professor Marks accelerated the growth factors without my knowledge. - Why would he do that? - Money, probably. The battle for grant dollars is as bloody as war itself. You didn't have anything to do with it? No, not at all. We were already playing God. There was no need to go further. I...I think it's gone. It's going to find a way in, sooner or later! - We gotta get out of here. - How do we make it stop? So, if we can't beat 'em, we'll just wait 'em out. There's a cold snap coming tonight. It should be below zero. Doped up or not, they should freeze solid. Am I right? I would have thought so this morning, but their metabolism is operating at an incredible rate. The cold doesn't seem to affect them at all. - This is very interesting. - And that's not all. They need to eat constantly to survive. They're insatiable. If they don't eat every couple of hours, they will starve. - Cool. - But not for us. Think about it. Once they finish up the bodies outside, they will find a way to get in here, to get us. They're ravenous. Our day just keeps getting better and better. - Why doesn't it break the glass? - It doesn't know what glass is. - Steve, are you awake? - Can you hear me? - What's happening to him? - He's having a seizure! Stick something between his teeth! No. You've gotta keep him from hitting his head. Roll him on his side in case he vomits. - We gotta get him out of here now. - How? I got an idea. I think he's gone, but it might be safer if we stay in here for a while. Nice try, Dash. What?! Which way? You want to go outside?! Not anymore. Dash, duck! Come on! Now! I got it. Get out of here! Don't make me throw you out! - It's stuck! - Go! - You gotta go! - We'll come back for you. Dash, close your eyes! Dash! Race over, ugly. You...Iose! It's dead! It's dead! Hey, Doc... ...nice rack. The kids! Come on! Bring him this way. Easy, easy... Put his head here. Bring him around. Get me some towels. Get me some towels! Where's Frank? - Now that's what I call a rescue. - What happened? Those things attacked the resort, we tried to escape, and we crashed. Impossible. They should barely be moving at this temperature. They're moving and killing like nothing I ever saw. Dr. Sommers was right. She came down here to warn us, but she was too late. We need to contain this situation immediately. We'll cage him up, figure out how to capture the others. We've gotta go blow those hairy mothers away! Don't press your luck. You're alive. This is most unfortunate. This is Captain Baker from the Pine Ridge Lab. Do you read me? Anybody in the lodge, do you read this? Loud and clear, Captain. It's about time, man. Sheesh. What's the situation over there? I'll tell you what the situation is. We have a dozen people barricaded inside the lodge, a kid who is critically wounded who needs to be evacuated immediately, we're low on food, on heat, we have no weapons to speak of, and I want to know what you people are gonna do about it. Roger that. We're gonna come up with a plan and get back to you in a minute. Yeah, we'll give you a minute. We're not going anywhere. This is Professor Marks. We understand the situation, and help is on the way, but if you wanna stay alive, you'll just have to stay put. Professor Marks. Dr. Sommers and I had a conversation about your spiders, so I happen to know what they're capable of. So I know that it's not if they break in here, but when. That's right, Professor. This is serious! Your midnight snacks to those spiders have got them more worked up than you realize. We don't have enough men to mount an assault. If we were out there in the open, they'd chew us to bits. You better find some way to exterminate these things. If you want our cooperation, then killing is out of the question. What, you just protecting your investment? Exactly! We have the equipment to capture them, but we need to get them to a confined area where we can get them to stay put for a while. Use the food from the lab. They're addicted to the hormones. It's like heroin to them. We still need to get them to a boxed-in area with an unobstructed line of fire. The snowboard half-pipe. If you guys could block off the bottom end, you could sit on top and pick 'em off all day long. Sounds great, but how do we get 'em there? You work on the pipe, I'll deliver the spiders. Call me when you're ready. Out. How can I make sure that they follow me? You need heat, motion, and light. I've got all three. - Johnny. - Yeah, dude? This could be the most radical ride of your life. Set up the avalanche cannon. On my signal, fire. Dude! Come on. Looks like the coast is clear. Almost like the Olympics, man. This is good enough for me. Dash, there's gotta be another way. Why don't you tell me about it when I get back? Wish me luck? Good luck. Good luck, man. Get some! Johnny, be careful. ...spider went up the water spout Down came the rain And washed the spider out So this is spider food? I hope they choke on it. They will. They better. Yeah! - Here they come! - All right, people! In your positions! They're all yours, Professor. Nail 'em. There's no reason to kill them after all, as you can see. Whatever, dude. Hey. Does this celebration mean that we won? They're still alive. This exercise validated our design work... and helped shave years of research, had we had to restart the experiment. What about what they did to the people at the resort? You still got a lot of dead and wounded back there. We'll take care of them, and they'll be debriefed. "Debriefed." Now, there's a good word. Can you imagine what the press is gonna do with this story? The press is not going to know anything about this. - Excuse me? - This is beyond top-secret. No one knows about this program, and no one ever will. How are you planning on keeping everyone quiet? By appealing to their sense of patriotism. We live in dangerous times, and we need the cooperation of all of our citizens to protect our way of life. Just like you protected all those people at the lodge. Kind of makes you wonder who the enemy is, doesn't it? - Mr. Dashiell-- - Forget it. I'm a civilian now, and I don't have to listen to this crap anymore. If you're not gonna do something about it, I will. What are you talking about? - Dash? - Plan B. Incoming! Yeah! Take that, army dudes! We don't need you to kick spider butt! Yeah! Rosenberg, Perez, do you copy? - Yeah, Captain. - Get up here. Are you insane? Get out of my face! I'm gonna have you put away for the rest of your life! You try it, buddy. Captain Baker... take this man into custody, and if he resists... shoot him. - Sir-- - Now, Baker! You're gonna have to arrest me, too. What? I'm as responsible as anyone. I'm not gonna help you cover it up. You took an oath, Dr. Sommers. I took an oath to maintain secrecy on a project designed to save lives, not to cover up the deaths of over 30 civilians. Thirty? I've seen ten times that number of people die in one air strike! When you were in college I was out on the front lines, fighting with the men, watching them die. This program is going to help stop that! And if you think you... or any one of you are gonna shut it down because of some collateral damage... Arrest them both. Fine. Sir... I think you're overreacting. If you don't do it, I will! Help me! - Shoot it. - What about the professor? He's already dead. Who in the heck are you? And just where do think you're taking that thing? That's none of your business, Mr. Dashiell. I think it is my business. A lot of people died up here today. It'd be a shame to have you folks join 'em. Okay. All right, that's cool... but what are you gonna do with the wounded? Ambulances are on the way to take care of Dr. Marks' chemical spill. I understand he was experimenting with a lot of powerful and illegal hallucinogens. Those people at the resort probably thought they saw all kinds of things today. You people have an answer for everything, don't you? Somebody has to. That was interesting. Just another government screw-up. Man, that was the baddest skiing I've seen in my entire life. - Totally epic! - You still got it, man! I thought it was a four. I guess I can still rip. Why? One of you punks wanna race? - No, thanks! - Forget it! Is skiing all you ever think about? What else is there? I could tell you sometime over dinner. Only if you let me show you my scars. Come here.
