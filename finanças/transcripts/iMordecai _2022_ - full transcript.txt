I, Mordecai. Everyone has their story. I was born July 27th, 1933, in Janów Podlaski, Poland. My father tells me it was a very hot day. Yohanan! Mordecai! Jakub! Jakub! Ssh! Oh, boy. What now? - What? - Hey, Dad. - Yeah, hello-- Marvin? - Yeah. What? I can't hear what you're saying. I can't take it anymore. I'm picking you up. We're getting you a new phone. No, don't come. I'm busy now. I'm on my way, Dad. Look, Ryan, the cigars need more time to age. Marvin, you're running out of cash. You can't hold out forever. Okay, I gotta go, I'll see you later. Mrs. Gomez! Mrs. Gomez! Qué paso? "Qué pasó?" Qué tú piensas? It's your crazy father again. Mom! What's going on? - Go ask him. - Dad! What the fuck?! Dad! Dad! What for you sneak up on me like that? What the hell are you doing? Your mother, she can't step into the tub to take shower, so we make walk-in shower. Yeah-- so you have a jackhammer?! Well, this place is built like bunker, all cement. What you want me to use, hammer and chisel? - Maybe a toothpick? - No, I want you - to call a plumber. - I am a plumber! You retired 15 years ago. How are you and Mom supposed to wash while you build this thing? Mrs. Gomez, nice lady, we use her bathroom. Mom! Mom! What is your yelling at your mother?! - I raised you! - I know, but he's-- --and I almost died giving birth to you. You have huge head. I know. All I wanted to do was come here, take him to the mall, and buy him a new phone. That's it. This is what I get. Okay, I go with you. Well, he's on a mission in there right now, I don't think he's gonna really listen to you. We'll see about that. Mordecai, we're going to the mall, or no hanky-panky. Okay, go get ready. Okay, we get ready. Okay, we get ready. Yeah, but I could-- I could fix this. I could put some more... - Dad. - ...electrical tape on it. - That's what I'll do. - Dad, face facts. The phone is dead. You should bury the Jeep with that phone. - "Ha-ha." - How about that other Jeep? That Nazi shit car of yours, huh? Going to rain, Mordecai. What rain? Where's the rain? Ugh! Great-- Dad, I thought you were gonna get a new window. Who needs new window? Here. Perhaps when the-- the big cigar deal actually happens, then I get the window, - and maybe new car with it. - All right, we're not having this conversation right now. I ask for the... report on the... loan. There's water on floor back here. Talk about being big shot in the cigar business, huh, now here in the making, and you say nothing. - Please, please. - Nothing, not even an update. Fine, you want an update? Next week, we get a new batch of samples, then we'll know. - It's not plumbing. - Water on the floor-- Look what happened in all my life. Huh? Look what I do for him, after he's shown no respect for me. - My-- My own son! - "Respect." - Where's my update? - Enough with the two of you. Car floor is full of water. Marvin, pull the plug. - I'm drowning back here. - Oh, my God. Brighten up, this is light here, we go now. I get my war reparations check from Germany, I go buy brassiere. How come you get reparations check, and I get shit? Because I suffered more than you, that's mine. How many times I have to say it? What is she talkin'... Ahh. - What do you think? - No-no-no, this is not-- - Pretty cool, right? - Not for me. It's all right, come on, you're gonna be all right. - We got the phone right here. - Marvin, Marvin-- I don't know how to use iPhone. - I got landline. - If you don't like it, you wanna give it back, we'll get another one. - No-- - Yeah, but I want you - to look at this, look. - No. Come on. All right. I'm gonna go get some help. Don't go anywhere. I don't... Marv... That's going to allow us to add some depth to our image, like this... see? See, in a digital world, we create our own reality. And through technology, we create anything we want to. We can make it real, make it come to life. Just something that existed in our minds today is now being shared with the world, instantly. And here is a perfect opportunity for me to show you exactly what I was talking about. Oh! Oh, my! That is all I have for all of you today. Thank you so much for coming, and I hope to see you next time. Hey, there. Are you interested in a course in digital art? Digital art? Thought this was phone store. Yeah... I don't even know what I'm doing here. Sorry. - Wanna know a secret? - Yeah. - Sometimes I don't either. - Yeah. - I'm Nina, by the way. - Nina. My son, he wants me to use an iPhone. But I happy with my old flippy phone for calling. It's been with me through all my plumbing years. Are you having trouble hearing who you're talking to on that thing? I have trouble hearing, period. Dad, there you are, don't wander off, please. Come here, I want you to meet somebody. This is Jared, he's an iPhone specialist. Pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. What's up, Nina? Oh, hi, uh, are you already together? Oh, not in a retail sort of sense. I actually have another class I have to get to anyway, so-- but good luck with your phone. Mr. Samel, I present to you the state-of-the-art of the state-of-the-art, the new iPhone. So what cost this phone - with no buttons? - Dad, you see these kids in the blue shirts-- you know what they call them? - What? - Prodigies. - Because they're so smart. - Oh, boy. Him? He don't look like Einstein to me. - Dad, don't be rude, please. - Rude? Why don't you show some respect yourself, huh? I don't want to come here in the first place. I get the fuck out of here. Your card, Mr. Samel. No bueno. Should've gone straight home. Here. Netta? Hon? Hi, I think she has a "welcome home" present for you in there. Let me take a quick sniff. Oh, boy. How was it with your family? Don't even ask. I get to the apartment, and there is smoke billowing out of the door. - Smoke? - Right, sorry, not smoke, it was plaster dust, to be more specific. And a lot of it. Everywhere. And that's just the beginning of it. Then he's dragging me there... And then he's like this-- "Hello? Hello? How are ya?" "Hello? Can ya get me up there." Look at your dad. Look at your dad. He screams at me inside of the store and storms out. But you still love him. I'm just concerned that he's gonna continue to get himself into trouble. You should just move them in here. What part of "jackhammering the bathtub" - didn't you understand? - You don't know. He might do a really good job on the bathroom. You know what? If he wants to be included in your big deal, include him. I'm getting the hang of this. You are a horrible father. It runs in the family. I'll do it right, I'll get it right. Here you go, Mr. Schwartz. Well, that's it for now. See you next month at the Survivors' Meeting, where we will celebrate Ida Brown's 100th birthday. From Auschwitz to Aventura. Happy Birthday, Ida. This party is going to be so amazing. How does it feel to be almost 100 with everything that you've been through? Ah, I was just about your age when I went into the camps. But I chose not to let that define how I live my life. If I did, it would dishonor my parents and my sister. Survivors have to tell our stories to young people like you, so it never happens again. Good morning, Point East! The bus for the bingo tournament is leaving in 15 minutes. --even talking about? Why, hello, Mr. and Mrs. Samel. Mr. Samel, I was hoping to see you. I want you to enter the bocce ball tournament at our annual community festival next month. Thank you, Mrs. Campbell, but I no play bocce ball. Oh, but Mordecai, it's going to be so much fun. You know, I was quite an athlete when I was younger. Oh, I can tell. So strong. Did you ever play anything professionally? Enough of this nonsense, I only going to tell this once. You stay away from my man. You buried two husbands already. You're not stealing this one. Mordecai, we go. I think that bocce's not for me. Now listen to me, you don't talk to that crazy shiksa. She was schtupping Mr. Longstein. He tried from heart attack on the spot. What are you-- meshuggeneh? We married 50 years. Every lady in the street, you think I'm schtupping them? I'm going to tell you something now. My brothers and sisters, they warned me about you. No-no-no, they warned you about the guy before me. The one with the mustache. What's wrong with you? Nothing, I hungry, - let's go eat. - Me too. Oh-- what you doing with that thing? It's an iPhone. From Marvin. Oh, Mordecai, I don't want that in this house. You see how people stare at that thing. That brainwashing device, like Stalin. There's no buttons. I don't-- I don't understand, there's no buttons. I don't care, I want you call Marvin in the morning and tell him... take that thing back. I said I take this thing back. When I say "never," I mean "never." Einstein, Mr. Einstein. - This-- This a return. - What? Dad, this is a person. - Really? A return? - No, no. We're here to get my father a few lessons. - Sign him up. - No-- no! No lessons. - A few lessons. - I take no lessons. I teach myself painting. I teach myself plumbing. No lessons. Mr. Samel, Nina's starting a group lesson over there in about ten minutes, if you wanna check it out. No, no group lesson. I get the fuck out of here. Oh, Nina. I just thought, maybe instead of doing group lessons for your phone, that... maybe you'll wanna do private lessons instead. Lessons no good, no. Well, what about with me? Just... I'll teach you. - One on one. - You? My manager might not be okay with it, though, so... can you keep a secret? In Yiddish, secret, that's my middle name. - Hah. - Okay then. All right, all right, I show up... for the lesson. I forgot to mention to you, there is a fee. A fee? What fee? Pretzel dog. With hot mustard. Ah. With mustard. - And hit Save. - So this is... these are buttons, but they're really not buttons, but they're buttons anyway? Yeah, that's pretty much the idea... Oh, my God. Hello? Marvin? Hey, Dad. I'm watching the babies. Yeah? Yeah, this is first iPhone call. I'm having first lesson - with Einstein Nina. - Oh, yeah? Oh, but Marvin, please, don't tell your mother. May I say you... you have value far more than pretzels. Thank you, Mr. Samel. I'm Mordecai. - Mordecai. - Yeah. Mr. Mordecai Samel. Paging Mr. Mordecai Samel. - Isn't that you? - Yeah. So, it wasn't a heart attack. Here's the thing, Dad. The doctor... thinks that she has a form of dementia. You know what that is? It means that her mind... isn't working like it used to. Yeah, so, whose is? Dad... it means that some days she'll be fine. And others, she won't. There's a name for it. - You can read about it. - Look. Ali-Holmes fight. We watched that when you were little boy. ...in Las Vegas, Nevada. That's the end of round number seven. Eh, shame. Ali... he's too old to fight. He used to be so strong. Now, look. ...and to see a man that's just kind of trying to... looks to me, hang on and keep the thing going - for one more time. - Dad. Mom can't really be alone, - you understand? - Yeah. You okay? I'll be back. Huh. Days like this, I miss Siberia. Ali's taking some fisticuffs. How's your mom? She's fine, nothing to worry about. Well, thank God. You have to be shaken up, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What's all this? Yeah, don't worry about it, we can talk about it another time. Well, no, I can see that you're stressed out. Just tell me, what is it? Well, it... is what it looks like, Marvin. It's bills, and this-- this?-- is a credit card I didn't even know we had - that's completely maxed out. - Well, I had to have cash to keep the factory open, okay? It's 0% for 18 months, we're gonna be fine. No-- we didn't pay our mortgage last month, Marvin. We have two baby girls, I don't sleep. Look, this is a cash flow problem, that's all. Every business goes through this. No, every business doesn't borrow a lot of money from your father. You have to keep him up to speed. Why can't you talk to him? Because he'll jinx it! What? He'll jinx the deal. - Jinx, like bad luck? - Yes! When I was about 16 years old, we were all in the basement, playing poker. Marvin, action on you. So I look at my hand. And I've got pocket jacks and another jack on the board, which gives me three of a kind. Now, this is the kind of hand that I'm all set to win, right out of the gate. - And who walks in? - I raise. - My father. - Marvin! - I call. - I'm in a hand, Pop! Right then, I should've known better. But what? Another jack. Four of a kind, I can't lose. - I call. - I call. Now, he might have a flush, but if he does, he's toast. Four of a kind is still the better hand. - And I know it. - I raise. Ooh, Marvin, that's a lot of money. - And the trap is set. - I'm all in. And his money is now gonna be mine. I call. It's in the bank, right? Not even my dad could ruin this. - Show me the money, right? - Quad jacks. - There ya go. - Wouldn't you know it? What?! He pulled a double inside straight flush - against four jacks! - How do you lose that?! But that doesn't happen! It's mathematically impossible in poker. It's never happened in the history of poker, ever. You know the difference between me and my son? I a plumber. I turn shit into money. You turn money into shit. That's just one example of many, many, of my dad, the jinx. Honey, Marvin, this is childish. Your father has helped you in every way. Please... talk to him, and no more credit cards. We have babies to feed. What you laughing? That, uh... that cartoon is too violent for me. You know, booming the wall. - Boom, I don't like that-- - You want I should change? Yeah, please. But don't put on that news. All right, all right, no news. No news is good news. Yeah. What? What "screensaver"? I got new kind of popcorn. You try some. Yeah, that... that's special popcorn. What you think? It's good. You don't even eat it. No, it looks good. Hi, eh, hello, Mrs. Gomez. What now, Mordecai? I wonder if you could keep an eye on Fela for a little while. Occasionally. The doctor says she can't be alone. I do it... for Fela. All right, thank-- thank you very much. So, here's the picture you told me to bring for the screen. - is this your family? - Yeah. It's in Poland. Yeah, this is me at six years. These are my two aunts, who always played with me. And my two brothers, Moshe and Avram. Moshe, he died during the war, and Avram still live in Israel, and my Uncle Marek, with the fiddle. He always play, even during the worst of times. This is my father. Where is your mother? Well, she was sick inside the house, and this was only day that the photo person was in the area. You know, I can't remember my mother's face. - At all? - No. This the only picture of my family. We had to leave everything. It was 1939. It was the world war. You heard of Hitler? - Yeah. - Yeah? Nice guy, hm? So, my village, Janów Podlaski, they-- they didn't know it, but Hitler was making this deal with Stalin-- That's the squinty guy with the big mustache? Another wonderful fella. They decide to split Poland like a watermelon, hm? Now, my town was in the east, on the Russian border. Now, this was lucky because Hitler invaded from the west. And then unlucky, 'cause Russia invaded from the east. Right into my village. This give us front row seats to the beginning of World War II. I don't really remember my childhood. But this day, I never forget. I never saw a plane or a tank before in my life. What is war to a young boy? It was all very exciting. Now, we have known the neighbor our whole lives. So, no big deal to get the ball back. But then... - Papa! - I did not understand what was happening. The mean neighbor chases me into my father's arms, and yells, "Get your Jew rat son "the hell off my property! "When the Nazis come, I will feed you to Hitler myself." My father made up his mind that we had to leave right now. But where will we go? The Russians are no better about Jews being rounded up. "I say, you're crazy, we can't leave now! "This home is the only one our family has ever known, for generations." "We leave tonight. We cross the River Bug and reach Soviet territory." "But how will you know it will be better?" "We don't know it will be better. "But we pray that it will. "Eventually, we hope we can make it to Palestine, and maybe America." So, my father always told the story that, if my ball never bounced into the mean neighbor's yard, we would never have left. But your family did leave, right? Except the aunties and uncles, yeah. They were going to wait until the young one was better, and then follow, but, um... we never saw them. They were sent to Treblinka. You know Treblinka? - The Nazi death camp? - I've... I've heard of it. Anyway, we found the records of my aunts when we made a trip to Poland. But, um... they never made it out. But here I am, still. I miss plumbing and painting, too bad. I miss going out on the town and music from the old days. And my tuchus has shrunk too skinny for my pants, but too bad! But I am alive! Yeah. Good afternoon, Point East! This is your last chance for pool jazz-ercise! Honey, she makes me crazy. She just asked if we'd register the girls for kindergarten. - You gotta be kidding me. - Nah, that's what I said. I was like, please, can we just enjoy our babies as babies before we start buying prom dresses? What is that? Looks like a big giant hole in the ground. - With my father in it. - Yup. What do you think he's doing? Well, Marvin, I think he is just being your dad. Why don't you go check on him? The girls and I will go see Fela. - I wanna go with you. - No! Talk to him. Be patient. Don't yell. Be an adult, and... have fun. Hey. What you doing? Digging for worms for a fishing expedition. What do you think I'm doing? Those motherfucks, they wanted to hire a plumbing company. Told them I'll do it better and for half the price. I'm a plumber. - You need any help? - Ergh, yeah. Give me the pipe wrench there. No-no-no, not the crescent wrench, the pipe wrench, there, there. Ahh, you don't know the tools. Oy... all right. All right, now give me the... Channellock. I don't know what a Channellock is. You don't know? Here. That one there. That's a Channellock, see, huh? You don't know nothing. Well, how would I? The only time you let me come on a plumbing trip with you, you fired me after ten minutes. Because you were incompetent. I was seven! Heh, I was in Siberian orphanage when I was seven years old, huh? Hard life for you, huh? I know how much you've done for me, Dad, but you know what? You're a little rough - on me sometimes. - Ah, you don't know from rough. Give me the endcap there. What's an endcap? Endcap, endcap, yeah, see this? Yeah. I raised a schlemiel. You know, Dad, I didn't come here to fight with you. I actually thought I'd update you on the cigar deal. Something good maybe? Well... not yet, I mean, the cigars are rolled, but the tobacco hasn't cured yet. We have to wait a little longer. - How much longer? - We don't know. We don't know, but we know that we're onto something really special here. The only problem is that the buyer doesn't wanna take our business until the cigars are - on the shelves. - Yeah, well, I don't blame him. So, you're so close. Put your cigars on the shelf, who's gonna know the difference? Everyone knows the difference. It's the taste. Everyone knows the taste. - Smoke tastes like smoke. - Oh, my God. You wait for special smoke, huh? While you wait for different-tasting smoke, bills go unpaid. This is asinine. I mortgaged my condo for you. I know you did, Dad, and I thank you. I have been paying the interest. Ay, what about I don't wait for that different smoke? - That's not gonna happen. - Ah, but... what if? Huh? Can you pay the workers? Can you keep the lights on? Can you stay in business? Ugh! You see? You ask my opinion, I'd've given instruction. But no, what, the whole thing's in the toilet? This is a fucking crazy way of doing business. You know that? Look at what you did, you nudnik! I wish to talk to you about our son. He don't respect me. What could I have done wrong, huh? If he only knew what I did to make his childhood better? No, it is so far from home. Is too-large ocean to cross going to America. This is intercoastal waterway. Manmade by dredging. This is not Atlantic... Fela? It's your husband speaking to you. I was just... yeah, well, would be nice to someday have shower. I'm waiting for the shower pan. Whoo! Come on, everybody! Together! And left and down! And right and down! Together! And down. All right-- keep going! Iris, you look great out there! Come on, everyone, keep that energy up! You all are doing so amazing out there. Tuesday, there are free samples at the grocery. - So we go there now. - Mordecai, I think it's time we changed up your routine. - What do you mean, you know? - Take out your phone taxi app. My phone-- I-I-I don't know... It's time you lived a little. Oh... Aah! What do you think about these shirts, Mordecai? Ah, a shirt's a shirt. I'm 80 years old. Nobody cares what clothes I wear. So, after almost my whole life as an orphan, I turned 19, I went searching for my family, and I find them. My father, he comes to me, and he says, "Meet your new mommy, "meet your new sister. We're going to Israel." I say, "What is Israel?" He said, "This is the Jewish homeland. "It's a beautiful country. "Palm trees. The Mediterranean Sea. It's nice weather." - Sounds like a nice change. - Eh, that's what I thought. But, when we arrive, after six week travel, they hand me a rifle, they put me in the front lines of the 1956 Arab-Israeli War. I don't even know who I'm fighting. Oh, my God, Mordecai, that's terrible. - I'm so sorry that you-- - Oh, no-no-no-no... no, I'm not complaining. No, no, look at where we are now, huh? It's a beautiful city. Beautiful art, huh? So... why you never talk about yourself? Huh? I wish I could do work like this. But my paintings don't exist in the real world. They're all digital. In the cloud. I am painter. Mordecai, you never told me you were an artist. Nah, well, it's easier than iPhone. Mr. Samel. Oh, hi, Jerry. It's Jared, Mr. Samel. - Uh-huh. - Hey, you know Ray's Original? Right across from Pretzelmaker? Right across from Taffy Swirl? Have you ever stood in the exact spot where all three smells collide? I stopped smelling in my 70s. It was-- It was a joke, Mr. Samel. Oh... Check it out. I'm doing a set at the Tea & Poets. - You might wanna come? - You're standing up? Yeah, for as long as they let me. So, where's Nina? Nina-- she's at her other gig. Volunteering at the Jewish Community Center. I no know she work there. - Why the JCC? - I don't know. Anyway, she said you gotta get some tunes back in your life. Follow me. Have you ever road-tested a pair of Beats? - What is that? - Are you kidding? You-- You've never-- holy shit, may I see your phone, Mr. Samel? It's-- I Mordecai. Mordecai, I imagine - you're a classical music man? - Yeah. But I-- I prefer klezmer. This is old Jewish music, mostly gone by now. No such thing as gone on the internet. Listen, Mordecai. Yeah. Ooh... Ooh! Oh, this is like morning sunrise over the fucking wheat fields! Mordecai? You have to pay for that! ...bocce ball tournament? How great is... I can't hear you. What is this? Oh! Hello, this Siri? What can I help you with? Oh, hello. - You are Siri? - Yes, I'm Siri. Here to help. Oh, Siri, that's a nice name. - How are you today? - I'm fine, thank you. Your friend Nina, she tell me to call you. Maybe you can take me to this place. 1293 Bantam Avenue, Miami. Getting directions to 1293 Bantam Avenue, Miami. May I say-- you have a beautiful voice. I keep this secret, because my wife don't know. She get jealous. Mordecai, you made it. Ah, I take phone taxi all by myself. So proud of you. Come on in. So... this is yours? - Yes. - Ahh. You need painter? I'm a painter. Well, then let's get started. - This way. - Yeah. Oh, my God, Mordecai, this is beautiful. - What do you think? - I love it. - Yeah? - I mean, you told me you painted, but I didn't know you painted - like this-- - Oh, I paint houses. - You're an artist. - Yeah-- no, oh, no, I-- well, I used to make paintings, but this is a first mural. - So, I teach you... - I teach you. - That's a deal. - That's a deal. Netta? Hey. Pedro delivered these this morning. Well, guess there's no time like the present. Here we go. Smells good. What do you think? Marvin, honey, what do you think? It's not ready. And your dad's here. - Ah, Netta. - Dad, what're you doing here? Well, I wish to go to this-- what you call it-- stand-up comic event tonight. - What? - So, uh... Mrs. Gomez, she has a date with this weaselly man, so I got the problem with your mother. - What's the problem? - Well... can she come here this evening for a while? And maybe she help with the children. Dad, I prefer to be here when Mom's here, okay? And besides, tonight is my big cigar event. Your event... you mean, when you make big speeches about cigars and give 'em out for nothing like an imbecile, and then everybody drinks brandy, which you also pay for? Yeah, that's about exactly right. Except that it's bourbon. I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal: you don't talk about the cigar business for 24 hours, - and I'll make it happen. - You got it. I go get her. But can you get her here by, like, 6:00? Mordecai... ha-ha. How long I supposed to be waiting in that phone taxi? All right-- there she is, I go. Marvin, no! I have my monthly Mommy and Me dinner tonight. Hi! That's my girl. - Hi! - More beautiful than always. You too! Where are those babies now? Sleeping. I-I go find them, I go inside. And now, next comic, welcome Jared Barrett. Yeah! Hi, uh... there's a lot of people here. All these people for you. Yeah, that's good. Shit! What is? What? You see the man over there with the suit jacket on? See, the bigger guy? That's Fernando Vasquez. He's a potential buyer for my company. I did not know he was coming tonight. Yeah? It's good for you I say hello. No, Ma, he's a potential buyer! Yeah, a sales opportunity. I say hello. Marvin, what's up, bro? - Hey. - How you doin', guy? - How you doin', man? - Yeah, good to see you. - Ton of people here to see ya. - Thank you so much. Hi, how are you, hello. Hi, thank you so much for coming. Thank you... Marvin, you see who your mother is walking up to? That guy Fernando, he may look like a schlub, but he is a fucking killer. Hello, I am Marvin Samel's mother. - Oh. - Oy. I wanna thank everyone for coming out to Empire Social tonight. It's an important night, and I wanna introduce my friend and yours, from Fumore Cigar Company, Mr. Marvin Samel. Thank you very much, Ryan, thank you for putting this night together. I really appreciate it. ...on NPR, they're saying that the digital age is making the human attention span shorter. Hey! I hear this joint has great craft beers. So, I don't know what they're talkin' about. Okay, tough crowd, uh... - You suck! - Oh, what else to say... All right, the third cigar we're gonna smoke tonight, the wrapper is a medium dark broadleaf grown in Ecuador. I'm sorry, no, it's-- it's a San Andreas negra grown in Nicaragua. - That what he meant to say. - Okay. He's struggling. So, uh... God, - uh... - Marvin. So everyone has enjoyed your cigars for many years, and you know, we wanna know how you got into the business. I mean, you brought your mom with you tonight, and I think it's great-- is this a family business? Is that you started in cigars? Are you kidding me? My father was a plumber. And also house painter, painted houses. Yes, and a painter. Sometimes both at once. I heard that guy talking about how he... hates his mother? Uh... - Oy vey. - You suck! I go help Jerry. What? - Don't worry. - No-- Mordecai! - I hear-- - Jerry! Yeah? Hey, Jerry, what are you doing? Uh, dying. Oh. Why don't you talk about something that you know? Do you have a funny story? Um, my mom's printer jammed last night. Well, I show you. Hello? I Mordecai. I tell you story. You might like. I was once a plumber in Canarsie, Brooklyn. So I'm finishing installation of the sink for Mrs. Green. - She says to me-- - Beautiful job, Mordecai. Tell me, you know where I can find a good house painter? I wanna paint the whole house, the whole thing. Ooh. I say, Mrs. Green, I paint it too. I will paint all four of your apartments, Including the basement. I'll give you a good price. She says to me, "But, Mordecai, you are plumber. You are not a painter." So I think for, mm... all right, if you don't want to use me, perhaps you should call my brother Martin, who is a very good painter. The best painter in all of Canarsie, Brooklyn. You have a brother? Of course. All my life. So she says, "All right, "give me the number of your brother Martin, I will call him." So, I run back home-- So my father comes home, he says, "If Mrs. Green... "calls your line, looking for Martin the Painter, you give to me the phone." I'm looking at him, like, Martin the Painter, I don't understand. He says, "Don't ask - no fucking questions!" - Don't ask-- Don't ask! "Mrs. Green calls? To me you give the phone." - Mm. - Of course, so now, it's ringing, and he's chasing after me, "Pick up, pick up your phone!" So, I'm terrified, I'm panicked, I answer the phone, "Hello?" So, I look at my father. I'm like, "Really, Dad, Martin the Painter?" He smacks me before he takes the phone. He says, "Yes, yes, Mordecai is my brother." Yes, I can come over and give estimate. And then he looks at me, and he winks, and he says, "Oh, directions? No, it's all right, Mordecai's here, I ask him." - So... - I get out... of my green plumbing uniform, and I put on the white pants and the white shirt, and I steal my son's hat and run back to Mrs. Green. I come in the door, I say, hello, Mrs. Green, I am Martin the Painter. My God, you look just like your brother. I say, of course, we are twins. This is all a true story. - Ma, am I right? - Please, now, don't even remind me. So, the next week-- Martin, Martin, quick! Call your brother Mordecai! There's a flood in the basement! Don't worry, I'll take care of it right away! No, no, Martin, you are the painter! I need Mordecai the Plumber! - I was-- I'll go get him. - Oy. In comes my father, still got the white painters' pants on, goes to big plumber's pants, and bang, he's out the door again. And she says, "But where is Martin? He not finished yet!" No, that's all right. He'll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile, I'll fix your flood today, huh? And that's how he made a living. For 20 years. So I was plumber, painter, Mordecai, Martin Samel. Two phone lines, two business cards, two names. And no one in Canarsie ever knew the difference for 20 years. And until this moment, right now, no one until this day ever found out. I like this. - I send Maria... - Uh-huh? my recipe for couscous... - Oh, that's wonderful. - But that's secret. Okay, no-no, she's gonna do a great job with that. And let me tell you, Fernando, you no worry about these other cigar guys wishing to buy Marvin's company. First of all, that only rumor. - Oh. - And I going to tell Marvin you're mensch, okay? Thank you, Fela. - Don't worry. - Good to see you. I will not worry. I've had a delightful time - with your mother all night. - We talking so much. I'm thinking that maybe... let's close this deal and buy your company. Marvin, this is smart man. Whoa, great, yeah, absolutely. I'll have my attorney set up the meeting. - Okay, great. - Huh? - You see how smart? - Fela, you are a gem. Oh, you too. - Okay, love to Maria, right? - Take care. And I'll be seeing you very soon. - Yes, Fernando, thank you. - All right. What did you say to him? Him our friend now, you know? Sometimes Yiddish help out better than fancy degree from college. I guess so. I guess so. I tired now. We go home now. - Okay, come on. - We go home now. Anybody else you wanna talk to? - No, done. - Okay. Fela? Fela? Fela? - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Marvin? Is your mother there? Is she still with you? It's me, Mordecai. It was amazing. Mom got us the deal! - What? - The cigar deal! It's a lock. They're not waiting until the cigars are ready. They want the company now. Well, congratulations! Why don't you come here, and you'll celebrate? Listen, it's late. I thought it would be nice for Mom to spend the night and see the girls in the morning. But we not spend the night apart, never. Okay, love you, Dad. "When the Nazis come, I will feed you to Hitler myself." Ugh. Mama? Mama! Mama! Fela. You just came back just now? Yeah. - Oh. - Mordecai, what's going on with you? Ah, it's... old memories, I... think too much. Mm. Fela... sit down. Sit here. I... Fela... I have a confession. I kept iPhone against your wishes. Also, I... I take lessons. For learning. That's where I go when I'm on my own. Look, I feel... like I'm becoming old man. This, I'm not ready for this. I not ready to be old man. Yeah, but, Mordecai... you are old man. Huh? That why you spending all that time with the dark-haired lady? Oh, yeah, I... I saw those lessons. Second floor, by pretzels. But only lessons. Yes, only, yes. Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah... it's only lessons. That's all. - Yeah, good. - Uh-huh. Because you know something, Mordecai, I love you. I love you too. Thank you. No-no, it's nice you take me to big deal. - But I no understand-- - Because it's a done deal. Netta was right, I couldn't've gotten here without you. - That right? - Dad, what I'm trying to tell you, is that I trust you. Yeah, but I-- I no understand. The buyer was waiting for the new cigar, but now they don't have to? Well, I don't know what to tell ya. Maybe they changed their mind, I mean, that happens. Oh, this is too good to be true. This is a crazy business. You watch out. Dad, maybe this trust thing goes both ways. - Eh. - Whoa, where are you going? I'm going to the meeting with you. - I pick up my check. - No, I need to do this part on my own, you wait here. After it's over, we'll go to a nice, - celebratory lunch, okay? - I thought you trust me. I trust you, just not that much. Hm. All right, all right, I go take a piss. Oy, never turn 80. Huh? Piss three times during "Jeopardy." You work in the fancy office, hm? My son, he owns a cigar company. Fancy big-fish company's going to buy. Today, finally. It was taking forever. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. We had to wait for the tobacco to be okay. - Oh. - So we wait and wait and wait on the tobacco, until we almost go broke. We were hanging on by the skin of our fingernails. We could've gone kaput. Huh. They literally pulled the deal off the table. What?! Why? What did they say? I don't know, something about bringing us another offer. What happened? Netta, it's me, Mordecai. Who knows? Who knows what happened? Huh? This cigar business is a crazy way to make a living. You. You happened. You're a jinx. It was a done deal, and your mere presence fucked the cosmic tumblers, again! - Marvin! - Yeah, Marvin! What's going on with you today? You seem... down. Nah, nothing, eh... I just feel like... disappointment to my family. My wife, she believes I'm a liar. My son, he imagines I'm a jinx on his life. Why is that? Well, years ago, he bring me to a head shrinker to find out. And the head shrinker... he says since I never had a childhood, I don't want childhood for my son. I tell him to fuck off. Of course you did. Mm. But he's right. I probably hard on Marvin, I know. I just wanted him to have better life than I had. - That's all. - Well, maybe you can tap into what it was missing. Like, what is something that you've always wanted to do, since you were a kid, but never got the chance to? Ah. You know... I have inspiration now to make more art. I would also like to remember the face of my mother. Okay, then... you work on being a kid again so that you can remember your mother's face and become a better father to your son. You think that would work? I think that "vould vork." - There you go, sir. - Thank you very much. ...and I don't know what that mean. - I wanted two... - Oh, thanks. So, uh, Dad... what's with the ice cream? Ice cream? Makes you feel like a kid again. - Huh? - What? Ice cream, it make you feel young. - Ice cream make me feel young. - Ya big-- married to a big baby make me feel young. Martin? I-I would recognize that hat anywhere. It's Mrs. Green, from Canarsie! Oh, yeah, Mrs. Green. This other brother, Mordecai. Oh, Mordecai, it's so good to see you. Oh, my goodness, oh, my-- and little Marvin, you were just a little boy the last time I saw you. So, tell me, what are you doing here? Well, we live here, in Point East. I live next door! In Williams Island. - What do you know? - We're neighbors again. - After all these years. - Yeah, yeah. Mordecai, tell me... how's your brother Martin? Martin? Oh. Not so good. He dead. Oh! Oh... my beautiful Martin. Well, listen, we-- we have to go, because we have an appointment, very important. We must go now, come on. Yeah, we go-- sorry. Goodbye, Mrs. Green. Goodbye. Why would you tell that nice little old lady that your twin imaginary brother is dead? - It's mean! - I'm retired. Why do I have to go on living this lie? Shut the fuck up, eat your ice cream. Good boy, come on. What? Yeah, I talking to you, you no pay attention to me. Oh, sorry-sorry-sorry. I was, um, busy with, um... Take a look. You make me look so young. Hm? Heh, that's me. I'm Mordecai. I'm the exhibitionist, yeah. Ho! Nina! Jared, don't go away! I'm exhibitionist! I don't know, I don't... Super Mordecai. You're looking all spry. Yeah, it's a nice day-- here, take a look, huh? I-- I exhibitionist. - Exhibitionist. - Yeah. - I don't think that's-- - Sure, you are. I'll remember to avert my eyes. Oh! I'm having a party, you should come. I don't remember the last time I went to a party. Well, we'll see. I very busy, handing out flyers. Hello in there! I see you! Here. - Huh? - Art? There's a brand new style of art called "geezer art." You may be interested, huh? Oh, don't throw away. This may be worth something someday, huh? Eh? Hello. Mama. There's a party later today. At Jerry Einstein's place. You know who he is. One of the Einsteins, yeah. So I want you should come with me. - No. - Yeah, yeah, come on. - I do. - Yeah, you know, Mordecai... ah, no, I-I very tired tonight. Maybe another time, though. All right, okay. No, we'll watch television together. - You want grape? - Thank you. That one look good. Okay, you know, you-you go, but you only stay one hour, right? This is okay for me, to go? Yeah. But only one hour. I promise, one hour. Mordecai? When I was your age, I drove barge on the Dead Sea in Israel. 1957, 1970. Elvis Presley comes and goes, I'm driving the barge. Vietnam War, it comes and goes, I'm still driving the barge. They get the man on the moon, yeah, I'm still driving barge. Only vacation I get is in 1967, and that was to fight in the Six-Day War. I don't even get a whole week, hmm? Only six days? I need a longer war. Mordecai, no talking, just smoking. Oh... Last time I smoked, it was hashish. I was driving army truck right across Egypt. It's a big drop if you get this one wrong. I know, I'm just... ...the home side has something going now, and the crowd is loving it. It's the bottom of the eighth inning, and so far it's been a very tight game. Mrs. Samel, wait! Stay there! Wait! It's interesting, you are this young girl who is interested in the older generation. You're very special girl, Nina. Very special. I'm really not, so-- I say you are, so you are. You are the nicest girl I ever met in the entire world. Listen... there is something I've been meaning to tell you - for a while. - Yeah? Mm-hm? So, what is this? My grandfather. You know... I left my phone... No, just... my grandfather was an SS officer. He was a guard at Treblinka. He died a couple months ago... I came home from school to... help my mom and dad with his house. There was a box in his basement. A hidden locker. And it had his documents in it, a uniform. Your parents, they knew this? My mom didn't. And my dad, I mean, he says he didn't know, but it was his father. How could he not? And then I met you, and... you told me how your aunts didn't survive Treblinka. The Jewish Center. Mm. 800,000 Jews they took to Treblinka. Only a few dozen got out. You're young, see? It's your curse. I don't know how you could understand anyway. You can't. No. My dad found me. He contacted me. And... he's coming here soon to... reconnect. I don't know what to do. Ask your phone. Mordecai! Mordecai! Messages. On your phone. It's about your wife. So, you've seen a swelling in the brain... She'll be fine. Mr. Samel, she's resting. Apparently a car sideswiped her, and she took a hard fall. She's got a fractured arm, and we'll check for a concussion, but I think she dodged a bullet here. Any idea why she was wandering on Biscayne Boulevard in a nightgown? Because... I wasn't there. Dad... can I talk to you for a second in the hallway? Dad, what were you doing? Where did you go? You smell like a keg. I was at the Einstein party. The what?! You know, the... The-- The sales kid Jared and Nina? - Mm-hm. - You've gotta be kidding me. Dad, these are not your friends. Okay? I pay them to teach you. That's right, I pay Nina to give you iPhone lessons, okay, not to get you wasted and have you out so Mom can go wandering in the dark and get hit by a car! We're lucky she wasn't killed. Look, you're an 80-year-old man. Act like it. I'll tell you something else. The deal? I'm gonna take the shitty deal that they came back with. Okay? So I can pay you back and not have to worry about this shit anymore. Oh, Fela... what happened? I told you I'd be back soon. Why didn't you stay home? Why didn't I? Fela... I need you. Mama. I feel so... sorry. Ooh... mm. Oh, ay-yi-yi-yi... Mm-hm. Marvin pay you to check on me? How's your wife? I tried calling. Okay, he did pay me. But only for the lessons. Mordecai, please, I trust you. Okay, and-- and you're my friend. The money didn't buy that. I don't know any other way to say it. Look, you should go. My dad's here. I know that it's selfish, and I know that the timing is terrible, but... I need you, Mordecai. Mordecai. Let her in. Come in, come in. Now, looking at you... I stupid old woman. I jealous of you. And you-- you beautiful. But you just child. Well, and also no competition. Rumors at the mall say you're a force of nature. Oh-oh. Okay. So, Nina, I hear your grandfather was bigshot Nazi. I don't know what to say. Give me your hand. Must've been so hard for you to find out what he did. And if your father is telling you the truth, must have been very hard for him, too. I never really thought about it like that. Oh, yeah, you know... sometimes I thinking it's good to put yourself in other one's shoes. You want coffee? She's awesome. Yeah. Will you come with me? Mordecai, go! All right. - I can't do this. - No, no-no-no-- - Maybe we should go. - No! I work on being a kid and a father to my son. Now you work on being a grownup and a daughter to your father. Mm. How's Mom? She's, um... she misses you. Does she believe you? Yes, after we talked. All these people... the people who were affected most by our... history? Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome to the stage our guest of honor, who is one century old today! Ms. Ida Brown! First, I want to thank everyone for coming. I think that, in a strange way... the thing that binds us together is our shared suffering. The pain of our past. The pain of our people's history. Yes, the war was terrible. Yes... we lost friends... family... whole communities, but for those of us who are left, the greatest condemnation of Hitler... is not just to survive and grieve, not just to remember, but to bless this life we were given. And to dance. L'chaim! That's my friend Mordecai right there. It's... feasible that his aunts were killed by Granddad. I have been traveling back and forth to Estelí for three years now for this plant. Now, you guys know the time, the sweat, the love that goes into making a great cigar. This time, I think I've got it. So, guys, friends, competitors, what do you think? Is this cigar a symphony? Sorry, Marvin, this cigar just isn't ready. Take the deal now, buddy. But here's the thing, as cigar makers, we don't really think about "the endgame" in terms of making money. 'Cause this is a passion. Marvin! It's your father! Netta, please, please, no-- please! Hey, Mordecai? - Hello, Marv-- Netta? - Yeah. What's going on? My father's calling, it's all right, so-- You know, in another three, six months, you'll have something here. Okay, so what? Marvin, uh, maybe you should start with signing the orange tabs. Yeah. Marvin? Hey, psst. Um... would you all just excuse me for just a moment, please? What the hell are you doing here? No, wait-wait-wait. All right. Netta tells me the deal you're making is on Thursday. - so I come in-- - Dad. No-no-no-no, this is what I have to say. I go to the bank this morning. Who knew the condo was worth so much? I take out a second mortgage. For a rainy day. Or for the unsuspecting jinx of the cigar investment. Also, it's possible I'm proud of you. It is a possibility. Hm? Hey, everybody, um... I'd love to just take a second, if you don't mind, to introduce my father. This is Mordecai Samel. Hey, are we gonna get this done? Actually, I don't think we can. How close are we to having the best damn cigar of the year? Oh, yeah-- very close. Very close, and once we have the best damn cigar of the year, that's gonna cause a lot of buzz, isn't it? - Yeah, all that buzzing. - Lot of buzzing. I was under the impression that you didn't have the funds to wait it out. Well, I think you were under the wrong impression. So, if you do wanna return to the original deal structure, we're gonna need to know in the next 48 hours? Yeah, no, 48 hours. Mordecai, you got so many calls on this thing. You know, first crazy guy from art gallery, then Nina, then Jared, who's coming here. - What? - Yeah. You're gonna be a no-show to your own exhibition? No, I no leave Fela alone at night. - She don't want me to come. - Then why are we here? Why'd she tell us to come? Fela? Come on, get changed. - You sure? - Yeah, I sure. You don't-- You don't-- - Ah. - You want... I come. Yes, welcome. This is my first art viewing. Yeah, well, don't be nervous, it's mine too. Maybe we could meet for lunch someday, huh? Yes, okay. I view your art now. But my art is over here. I know! Fela, where's Mrs. Gomez? How you get here? What, you take phone taxi? I... took a Marvin taxi. I took a Netta taxi. Marvin. I'm glad you came. I'm glad I came too, Dad. Come here. Dad, thank you for everything you did for us. It meant a lot. Listen, I-- I wish to know about the deal, but, um, with respect, you don't have to say. Dad, you should know about the deal. I gave them two days to respond. They responded in two hours! I didn't get to the parking lot! - You mean they buy? - "They buy"? They buy big. They buy big! Mr. Mordecai! - You ready? - Huh? - You ready? - Oh, Nina, Jared. I've never been more happy in my life. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? To the man who has taught me... so much. I am so proud to present Mordecai Samel's Art History. And Einsteins-- if you will, please. Bravo. Speech, Mordecai, speech! You see? We teach each other. That's what friends do. Well... now, the first thing I would like to say is that I talk too much. Then I, you know... I look around. And I see... ...it's nice to be young. It's nice to be old. It's nice to have phone with no buttons. Also, it's... it's nice to have family. It's nice to have friends. Mama. L'chaim! L'chaim! Wonderful! Well done! You see what I told you? It always works out. Fela? Fela? Fela? Fela? Fela? It's me. It's your husband. Mordecai. Where are you going? I don't know. Okay. I'll go with you. Come, I go with you. - You-You... - Yeah. Come on. Thank you. - Mordecai? - Yeah? Yeah, let's go home. Me. - Oh. - Do it one more time. - That's good. - That's good. You know what? When I was your age, I grow up... you know what I was wearing? Diaper... from a sack of potatoes! I was sleeping in a hole on straw. I didn't have a house. I was always hungry. I didn't have a mommy. - No? - No. I don't believe in dreams, but this is like a dream come true. I have two grandkids from my son, I have five grandchildren from my daughter. And... work out very good for me. That's the story, my friend.
