No no, I got this, I got this. Hey, can we get out of the road? People have places to be. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Well hello there, ladies. I kinda need you all to move out of the road, like now. Who told you you could drive on our road? Why are you doing this? Sir, I got a couple bucks in my pocket if you need it, but I'm not interested in buying anything. You want us to get out of your way? Beg us. Can we move? We move when we want to move. We stop when we want to stop. And we dance when we want to dance. You guys aren't too bright, are ya? Can we move? You don't own me. Okay, where's the mom at? Is she as ugly as the rest of you guys? See you soon. You little thick up there too, buddy? These your kids? Real nice what you're teachin' 'em out here. Where's the mom? She as ugly as you are? Isaiah, I miss Mom. You better not let Pa hear you say that, Meg. Mom's gone. Pa killed her. No, you're a liar. You're a liar, Pa loved Mom, he wouldn't do that. I heard them arguing. Mom said she was leaving him. She ran out the front door and Pa ran after her. He picked up his ax. Isaiah, Pa loved Mom, he wouldn't do that. You don't know anything, you don't know. I saw him kill her. He hit her in the back of the head. She fell down and then he, he killed her. (HEAVY BREATHING) He killed her. (ISAIAH CRYING) I'm gonna go ask Pa where Mom is. Stop, this has gotta end. - JENNIFER: Are you serious? - Come on, now, man. - Really? - WOMAN: Look what you've done. Look what you did. Yeah, that's gonna cost a lot of money to clean this car. Appreciate it, man. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Backwoods hillbillies, get out of the road. There we go, let's speed it up. Pa, where's Mom? (CLOCK TICKING) Gone. She's gone and she ain't coming back. Ungrateful, I spent 20 years in those mines putting a roof over your head and food on the table. I miss Mom, she used to sing to me to help me fall asleep, and... She's gone, I said. What are you, stupid? Do you hear me? She's gone and she ain't coming back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I still love you the best. I'm sorry, I'll never mention her again, I'm sorry. Don't you fret none. Daddy still loves you. There's gonna be some changes around here. Yeah, there's gonna be some big changes. I'm tired of bein' walked on, I'm tired of people lookin' down at me and mine. (DISCORDANT MUSIC) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Morning, Jon. How's it going? What do you care, you writin' a book? No sir, just trying to be friendly. Sheriff, me and you ain't never been friends. So why don't you run along and be friendly to somebody else? You drinkin' again, Jon? Nope. Okay. Thought I'd just check to see how you, Karen, and the kids were doin', hadn't seen you in town in a while. Yeah, we got everything we need right here. We don't like to be around you self-righteous fools. Jon, you weren't always like this. I remember when we were kids. Yeah, we ain't kids no more, Sheriff. And I ain't tryin' to hold hands with you and skip down memory lane. Don't you worry about me and mine. What you better worry about is that pretty little girl of yours I see out alone - all the time at night. - Is that a threat? Better be careful, Sheriff. Boogeyman might just snatch her up. Is that a threat? You as much as look at her, Jon, that's the end of ya. If you as much as look at her. Get off my property. (OMINOUS MUSIC) We're gonna be the reason they're afraid of the dark. Pa, Pa. You know what, girl? You're just like your mother. You talk way too much. Time to hunt. (EERIE MUSIC) (LAUGHING) I see you in there. Come out, we just want to play a game with you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) You all are no fun, why don't you open up? Some people just don't know how to have fun. - Hello? - Tim. Tim, it's the crazy clowns out on the road. We know you're in there. How did they find us? I don't know, I told you not to mess with them. I didn't think they would come here. Well what if they hurt the baby? The baby, what about us? Us? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Tim, that's the big one? He's got an ax. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Come out, come out wherever you are. The girl is mine. (OMINOUS MUSIC) You say we're monsters. You say we have no soul. You hate us, you fear us. Oh, you look like you took quite a fall there, pal. How are you feeling? What's that? Ooh, I like the sound of that. Why don't we have a little taste of it, shall we? (LAUGHING) I hope you're ready. This part is going to tickle a lot. It'll be okay. Go on, do it. In case you haven't noticed, my sister loves to slice. Let's do it again, shall we? (TIM GASPING) Ooh, beautiful. You're not going anywhere, buddy, you're staying right here. Go on, keep doing it, don't stop now. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Don't stop now. At least he knows manners. Do it again. Hmm, looks like he's not gonna answer me now. Why don't we show him what happens when he doesn't answer us. Again. (TIM STRUGGLING) Yes, you're just making this harder on yourself. Stop struggling. You are all just weak sheep. (TERRIFYING MUSIC) Baa baa sheep. Baa baa sheep. The wolf is at the door. Not a whole lot of room to hide in here, huh? Let me ask you, how'd you end up with that piece of human trash, anyway? Let me guess, dad died when you were young, mom workin' all the time, had to pack your own lunch. Guess, are you a peanut butter and jelly girl? Feel free to answer. Then you went off to college 'cause you made such good grades, met Mr. Wonderful and his red sports car. (OMINOUS MUSIC) So Prince Charming there swept you off your feet. Then all the sudden. It's just a matter of time, girl. Isaiah, Meg, come here. Pa needs us. Help. I'm coming, are you okay? Here, I got the baby, I got the handcuff keys. We gotta get out of here, downstairs. There's a gun in the bedroom. Okay but here, let me put your sock on. It's gonna help with the bleeding. (BABY CRYING) They're in the bedroom. The fool has a gun. Isaiah, show her how weak he really is. (FOREBODING MUSIC) (BABY CRYING) Shoot him, protect your family and shoot him. I knew you wouldn't be brave enough to protect your family. It's a real shame, I can only imagine how your poor child must feel when you're older. Take her baby. (TERRIFYING MUSIC) Please don't take my baby. Please don't. (BABY CRYING) Please don't take my baby. Please don't take my baby, please. Please don't take him. Please don't hurt my baby. Bring him back alive. I have plans for him. (EERIE MUSIC) (LEAVES RUSTLING) You're crazy, you're all crazy. Why are you doing this to us? You're all alone, little girl. Your husband done jumped out the window and left you alone with us crazy people. He loves us, he will be back for us. Yeah he loves you so much he jumped out the window and left you here to die. You're right, though, he'll be back. He'll be back when Isaiah hunts him down and drags him back. - No. - He left you! He left you and your baby here to die. Girl, are you stuck on stupid? Open your eyes. We haven't harmed you or your baby. (SOMBER MUSIC) Well? Am I gonna be a daddy? No. I mean, the doctor said it was gonna be a one in a million chance. But, I mean, I wanna try to be that one. Listen, when I married you two years ago, I married you for better or for worse. I love you, with or without a child. I just feel I want a child, a little you and me running around here, y'know? Don't wish that on us. Y'know, I wanna have you a son. I know you want a son, like right? I just want you. You're the best husband a girl could ask for. I know, maybe now's not the time for a son. (OMINOUS MUSIC) So you tell me, who is the real villain? Are you sure it's us? (LEAVES RUSTLING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (EVIL LAUGHING) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (FOREBODING MUSIC) Come out and fight me like a man. Are you a coward? (TERRIFYING MUSIC) Like a man? What do you know about being a man? You ran away and left your defenseless baby. I'll, I'll kill you. Kill me? You're no killer, I know killing, I know pain. You're soft, you're pathetic. You're a parasite. You're a worm under my foot. You were born with a silver spoon but no balls. (DISCORDANT MUSIC) You can have the baby, you take the wife. Have fun, buddy, you can have it all. Please, please don't kill me, please. The real villains don't wear makeup. They wear three piece suits and sell their family for $1. I know who I am. I am the pain I feel inside. Your soul is black as midnight. I think it's time, Pa has plans for you. (ISAIAH LAUGHING) Hm, I wonder what I should do with him now. That's a pretty bad wound, boy. No, Pa told me he was going to do it and he'd take care of it. I don't think Pa would mind if I just left a few more scratches. Oh, just mm, I would love to do some more. Pa will be angry, I don't know what he might do after what he did to Mom. I would love to do more to the last of your pretty face. I don't think Pa would mind if just. Still though, you're being loads of fun. Have all the fun, Pa. Not fair. Maybe after Pa is finished with him, he'll give it to me. Just for once, I want to do something. Still. It's a shame, really. He gets to have all the fun, I just get to watch. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Fun for once. I'm sure he won't mind if I do a few first. Make a few lacerations here or here. Maybe even here. No. (WOOD CLATTERING) I suppose I should take him to Pa now. Pa, I got him. He was running away and I caught him. I did just like you said, I didn't kill him. You mean you caught him running back to the house to save his precious wife and baby. (BABY CRYING) Right, Isaiah? No Pa, he was running hard in the other direction. He wasn't trying to save nobody but himself. Get up. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Kill him. - Kill him. - No, please don't make me do this, please don't make me do this. I'm begging you, I can't. I can't do it. What are you doing? (BABY CRYING) Please don't make me do this. Kill him or Isaiah will kill your baby. Isaiah, if she hasn't killed him in five seconds, kill the baby. JENNIFER: I can't, please don't make me do it, please. - 1,001. - JENNIFER: No. - 1,002. - Kill him! No, I can't do it. 1,003. Oh, please don't hurt the baby. 1,004, last chance, do it. (JENNIFER CRYING) (SOMBER MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) Welcome to the family. (EERIE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Enoch, my son, you are the hope for a new world. A better world. The world we live in is full of sheep, blind sheep, ripe for the picking by the wolves. You will protect the sheep from the wolves. You will be their shepherd. You will continue my work way after I am dead and gone. I am teaching you the way of the strong, the way of the lion. The sheep drive their motorized coffin to work as slaves for the rich. To fight for the scraps thrown from their master's table. Only to work until their bodies can work no longer for their cruel overlords. And then they are put six feet into the dust where their loved ones cry tears of blood and the rich laugh and count their gold. You, Enoch, you will be their savior. You will save them from themselves. You will save them from their lust of the rich man's gold and silver. You will sit in judgment of the rich. You will be their judge and their executioner. You, Enoch, will be the swift and brutal hand of justice, making the rich bleed for their sins. You will not die for the sheep, you will kill for them. Avenging them against the evil men who love money. By doing this, Enoch, you will cleanse the world of greed. You will cleanse the world of the hatred and strife between brothers and sisters caused by the man of sin. This evil was brought by the rich so that they could profit from the death of the poor. Enoch, my son, the quest before you is a holy quest against Satan himself, a quest that will right the wrongs of the serpent and his children, a quest to expose their lies to the whole world, a quest to light a fire so massive and so intense that all the world will burn to cleanse it of the men of evil. By your hand, Enoch, blood will flow through the world like a great river. By your hand, my son, all of the world will be saved.
