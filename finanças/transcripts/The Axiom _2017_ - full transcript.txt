Please don't make me go in. Please. Please. Please. Please. [gun cocks] [sobs] [whimpering] [girl pants, whimpers] [ominous music] [girl screams] [foreboding music] [blood splatters] [rock music playing] [man #1] "A doorway leading to another world. A place where nature behaves differently. A beautiful... - osis." - No, oasis. Thank you. You know, your sister's handwriting just sucks, probably why she tore out all these pages, she couldn't read it herself. [chuckles] Uh, drive's taking a little longer than we thought, huh? We should probably leave early Sunday morning. Sunday? I mean, is that even gonna be enough time? It's five days. I mean, how long did you plan on staying out there? I don't know. I mean... But Marylyn is obviously my priority. So, what if we don't find her? Jesus, we will. Okay? But I have to be back to work - by Monday morning. - Yeah. Me, too. Yeah, that Days Inn is really understaffed this time of year, huh, Gerrik? [chuckles] Fuck off. It's just temporary. They'd ship me away if I didn't fulfill my work visa. - Oh, you are the cutest bellboy. - [chuckles] Kenz, don't worry. Five days is plenty of time. We'll find her long before then. Okay. [upbeat music] [Martin] How do we know Marylyn is in trouble, and not just being Marylyn and, you know, kicking it out some hippie commune or something? Yeah, I wouldn't put it past Marylyn. Okay, well, you guys don't really understand. 'Cause even if she was in a hippie commune, Marylyn would let me know. I mean, Jesus, when she went camping in that glacier last summer, at Logan's Pass, she still wrote to me. And she was in a fucking glacier. She wrote to you from Logan's Pass? Yeah. Several times. Which is more than I even hear from you. And you guys live down the street. Okay, that's enough of that. Uh, I definitely didn't expect the car ride to be so long. The sun's supposed to set tonight at 8:45, so as long as we get there before then, and set up our tents, we'll be fine. Jesus, we better get there before then. I am dying of boredom. [Darcy] Oh, my god, Gerrik, you knew how long this was going to be. Why did you even come? Because McKenzie invited me. No, no, no, I didn't. I asked Martin to come and he insisted that you guys go. Well, the more the merrier, right? But seriously, how long do we have left? At least another three hours. [groans] [McKenzie] Okay, shut up. I'm the one driving, so just take a fucking nap. Well, I was excited for the car ride. I really expected it to be a bit more fun, you know? [Gerrik] Drinking beers. Stopping off at old gas stations where some old man works and is creepy to you girls, and Edgar would, like, spit in his face. And he would follow us because he'd know where we're going. - [Gerrik mumbling] - Oh, my god, Gerrik. Do you hear yourself talk? [Darcy] And just so you know, we are having fun, okay? Think about it this way, we're going on a manhunt. I've never been on a manhunt, so I'm really excited, because we are going on a manhunt. Me, neither. It's like, uh, the most dangerous game. - [Gerrik] Mm. - You know? Except for the fact that we are trying to find Marylyn, and not kill her. Yeah, that's a big difference there. Hey, do we know anything else about this guy that we're supposed to be meeting? Besides the fact that this asshole is trying to ask for money before he tells us what he knows about our missing sister? Yeah, fuck that guy. Okay, he's not asking for money. Well, then, what is he asking for? [snickering] I mean, I guess we're gonna find out. He's the only one that responded to the post. So... "Looking for sister, Marylyn Cody, last seen headed for Cinder Park, any information, please call." You posted this on Craigslist? Without any sexual favors attached, and somebody actually responded? Yeah, I mean people always respond to stuff on Craigslist if they know something. It's true. It's how that guy in Germany found someone who would let him eat him. Oh, god. I forgot about that guy. Mm-mm. Armin Meiwes. His friends were probably like, "No one's gonna respond to that." Well, he probably didn't have any friends. But he did have faith. [Edgar] And so he posted his cannibal ad on Craigslist. And then a week later, he met that Danish guy... - Yep. - he let him eat him. Sometimes you have to have a little bit of hope. - Is that real? - Real as shit, look it up. Oh, my god. People are so fucked up. I gotta pee. - [Edgar] Seconded. - And third. [Gerrik] Fuck it. Anyone else want one? [Edgar] Oh, my god. Yes. Thank you. Uh, uh, uh! Are bipolar people allowed to drink? Come on, man. Yes, I can have a beer, you dick. [laughing] Just don't feed me after midnight, though. That's the one thing. - I'm sorry, man. - That's fine. [Gerrik] It's just... you know, with the hospital stay and all. Okay, guys, I'm fine. All right? The manic episode, as the doctors are calling it, was due to stress. So all I have to do is just take... Just take the shit they gave me and take it easy. And honestly, this is like the best thing for me. It's been way too long since I've been camping. I, mean, shit I need this. [Martin] Edgar's the best person to have out here. It wasn't that long ago, he was guiding raft trips in Colorado. Marylyn would always talk about the shit you did. Said it was really dangerous. So, by her standard, it must mean it was impressive. [Martin chuckles] [Gerrik] Marylyn really said that about Edgar? [Martin] Yes. She did. Fuck, man. - I'm impressed. - Eh. Your older sister is one fine... independent woman. She must be found. [Edgar laughs] - On that note, shall we? - [Edgar] Yes. [Gerrik clears throat] Come on, McKenzie. [foreboding music] [Gerrik] Okay. We must be close. Actually, I think we're here. Oh, shit. That place looks fucked. Okay, no. You just know some old creepy guy with like half his teeth, works in there. Yeah. Some like, retired serial killer? Praying for a group of city folk to travel through and fall into his web. You think there are retired serial killers? Like the ones who never get caught then get too old and give it up? Yeah. Yeah, just like living normal lives now. Guaranteed our landlord might be one. All right, who's coming in? [Gerrik] I'm good. Yeah. No, I think you guys got this. Why did we even bring these pussies? - [scoffs] - [Edgar chuckles] Come on, I gotta pee. [Edgar] You got this, sis. Oh, this place is fucking creepy. [foreboding music] - [door opens] - [bell rings] [ominous music] Maybe this guy really is a retired serial killer. Ha. Shut the fuck up. Don't say that. Cooks his victims into the food. Gross, Darcy. I'm just saying. Brace yourself for something fucking weird. [Darcy] Hello? [McKenzie] Jesus. - [man #1] Hi, there. - [girls shriek] - Jesus Christ. - Holy hell. Holy Hell. You girls, you scared the living shit out of me. Oh, yeah? We scared the hell out of you? You were the one that just crept up behind us, and... - Who does that? - [man #1] I said... I said hello. Yeah, but can you do it before you're like, two feet behind us? I'm so sorry, I was out in the back fixing the dishwasher. Didn't hear you come in till the bell rang. Yeah, well the guys are probably freaking out now. Tell me about it. Well, I have to use the bathroom, so could you please tell me where that is? But I don't want to leave you here, though. [McKenzie] It's fine. Are you sure? Yeah, Darcy it's fine. The bathroom is out, on the side. [Darcy] Thank you. Sorry for freaking you out. Hi, I'm looking for a man named Leonard. Is he here? Yeah, that's me. Leon. Oh, okay. Well, I'm McKenzie. - We spoke online... - You're Marylyn's sister. Yes. [McKenzie] Do you know... Do you know where she is? - [retreating footsteps] - [sighs] Now these, these are heart rate monitors. [Leon] They go on your wrist, easy-peasy. Uh, this cell phone, it's tweaked to work in there. Now, I usually get a deposit for this stuff, most of it's expensive. Especially these. [Leon] Each of you, you drink one of these before you go in. Not after. Now, it doesn't taste great. But it keeps them from talking to you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down. I don't know if I need any of this, whatever this shit is. All I wanna do is find my sister. Okay, so I know that she is in, um... Cinder Park. If she is in Cinder... Cinder Park. I just don't know whether she's in the rolling hills, or the falls, or if there's another place - that I don't even... - [map crumples] - What the fuck? - That map's not going to do you any good. You're gonna need this. Okay, but she's in Cinder Park. That's, that's where we need to go. No. The signs might say Cinder Park, but that's not where you're going. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't understand. You don't know? What exactly did your sister tell you about what she was looking for out here? She didn't tell me shit, but, um... [clattering] ...this did. You stole her journal? Yeah. It's a sisters thing. You wouldn't understand. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay, so she keeps mentioning this secret passageway in the forest, but she never says where it goes or anything else, and it really doesn't make any sense. Uh... She also keeps mentioning this place which I can't find on any of the maps. Um, I think it's called... The Axiom. Yeah. Wow. Your sister's truly amazing. How she learned all this, I'll never know. Well, in these pages... She talks a lot about how the forest is dangerous. And how a lot of people are known to have disappeared. It's dangerous if you're stupid. [Leon] It's dangerous if you don't listen to people who are trying to help you. Cinder Park. [Leon] You follow this path. The passageway, the door that your sister writes about in here. It's real. It's right here. And what's so special about this passageway, this path? Where does it go? I thought you'd never ask. Please, just promise me you won't say anything. I can't believe you told Edgar and not me. Oh, my god. Come on, as her brother and his best friend, I need to know these things. You're not his best friend. We're all best friends, equally. Who the hell's gonna be your best man? Just both of you, shut up, please? She doesn't want to tell anybody yet. Oh, here she comes. [Edgar] Shut up, shut up. [Gerrik whistles] [Edgar laughs] Classy. And that's your future wife. Goddamn right, it is. McKenzie's still in there? Yeah, she is. She's been in there for a while. You should go check on her. Can't you? [sighs] We talked about this. Uh-oh, is there some trouble in the Cody family we aren't aware of? - Sibling quarrels? - No. No, we're fine. They're definitely not fine. I told McKenzie about Darcy and I moving to Clayton just before we left. So... So, what, it's like 20 miles out from town? Exactly, but, I mean, you know McKenzie. She, she wants the family to be around like, all the time. It's like... It's a bit much. She just loves you. She wants to be around you. - It's not nuts. - Oh, now, we know why you're hunting so hard for Marylyn. She's cutting her losses with you. I'm perfectly okay with that. You're her big brother. That means something. [Martin] Huh. Uh, come on, please? For me? God. [whispers] I'll do really naughty things - to you later. - Hey, I'll be right back. Goddamn it. - Winner. - [chuckles] [foreboding music] [indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] [Leon] That's what I thought. You're a fucking liar. - I'm not lying. - It's not possible. [Leon] Look, I know it's hard to take at first. You've just gotta try and keep an open mind. [scoffs] I just don't get why you're fucking with me right now. Oh, look, sweetheart, I don't give a damn if you don't believe me. You'll see. You go there, you'll feel it. It's warm. The closer you get, you can feel it vibrating. Like there's loud music coming from the other side. [Leon] That's how you'll know where it is. So you listen to me. You take this stuff and you put it into your little backpack here. - [door opens] - [bell rings] [Leon] Hello, there. - You okay? - [McKenzie] Yeah. I'm Martin. Martin. I'm Leon. Nice to meet you. You know where our sister is? [Leon] I surely do. I've was just telling your McKenzie here. See, you follow the path. In the center of the forest, there's a group of traveler outposts. She should be around there somewhere. Okay. Thanks, man. If there is anything we can do for your help... Why, thank you, Martin. Actually, there is. You see, last time I was at Cinder, my wife, well, she lost something. A necklace that I'd, well, she'd really like it back, and, here, you take this. Pretty, isn't she? Now, you see that necklace? Now, that should be around that traveler's outpost. You know, lost items usually end up there. Why haven't you just gone in and gotten it? You kidding? Got a business to run. As you can see, it's in a desperate need of attention. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, we'll keep an eye out for it. You know, I would truly appreciate that. Oh, the park is technically closed this time of year, but I know the ranger. Yeah, you pop that on your windshield, no one will bother you. Cool. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. You know, I greatly admire Marylyn. I do hope she's okay. Hey, you watch out for that sister, huh? [tense music] Good luck. Is everything okay? What'd they say? McKenzie, you all right? [Martin] That was weird. Why would Marylyn ever go see that guy? Because the park's closed. And now we can get in. All right. Let's go find Marylyn. [foreboding music] [Darcy sighs] Ugh, I just lost service. Aw, what are your 12 followers gonna do? Oh, I just lost service, too. If the park was closed, why would Marylyn ever go to this traveler's outpost? What do you think she was looking for out there? I don't know. Definitely have to camp there. The sun is going down. Guys, I'm afraid we are setting these tents up in the dark. [ominous music] [Martin] Gerrik, I'm gonna fuck you in your tent tonight. Welcome to Cinder Park. [Gerrik] We're here, baby. I can't wait to get out of this fucking car. [all groan, sigh] [foreboding music] [sighs] - [Darcy] You gotta pee? - [Martin] Mm-hm. [Darcy] Oh, I gotta pee. [Gerrik] We're not gonna get in trouble for this, are we? I'm really scared of the law services out here. [Martin] Gerrik, calm down. You're not that important. [Edgar] Did you know there's, uh, there's a new species of frogs in this area? - [Gerrik] Frog? - [Edgar] Yeah. [Edgar mumbles] [indistinct chatter] [foreboding music] [indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] [Martin] "Cinder Creek Traveler's Outpost." To the right. [Martin whistles] [ominous music] [Gerrik] What the fuck is she doing? McKenzie, the trail is right here. [Martin] Kenz, what's up? Hey, Gerrik. Come here. - [McKenzie] You wanna help me? - Yeah. [McKenzie] Okay, come here. I need you to walk in that direction... for 20 feet. Can you do that? Yeah, but why can't we... - Can you? - Yeah, obviously. Okay. Go. [Gerrik clears throat] [Gerrik] All right, McKenzie. I'm walking. I'm walking. Is this far enough? [eerie music] [Gerrik] Good one, guys. The old leave while my back's turned trick. You guys are hilarious. [branch snaps] [distant growl] [leaves rustling] [twig snaps] Are you really that high, still? Dude, such a fucker. Goober. All right, let's go. [Darcy] I definitely think he's had sex with a girl before, it's just been a really long time. - [McKenzie] Gerrik? - [Darcy] Yeah. There's no way. What the fuck? It's too warm out, I'm not walking another step. [sighs] [Darcy] I think they're stopping. - Come on, man. - No, fuck you, Martin. You never said this had so much hiking involved. Come on man, let's just set him down for a minute. Have you got any more weed left? Uh-uh. No, we'll play a little game. It's called you get to the tent and we can smoke this joint. Fucking wanker. [laughs] [exhales] So, I just had a great idea on how I can just get my green card and my days at Days Inn will be a thing of the past. [Edgar] Oh, my god. Really? [Gerrik] What? You saw the way she was touching my arm back there. Uh-huh. Come on, man. What do you say? Dual wedding? We'll be each other's best man. I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear this. [McKenzie] We don't have all day, come on. You gonna let a bunch of girls beat you? I'll beat you up the mountain. All right, go on. Just saying, this is why you're not getting laid. [Gerrik] Whoa. Harsh. I'm sweating. And the sun's still out. How is that possible? It's almost nine. Sun might set a little later this far north. Still... it's really bright out. Uh, so... [clears throat] Darcy and McKenzie. Do they ever hang out? No, not really. Darcy's got her friends from work. And McKenzie, she's got... - You. - [laughs] Does McKenzie have a boyfriend? I don't think so. I don't know. Dude, you don't know if your own sister has a boyfriend? Don't worry, we can fix that. [laughs] [Gerrik] She is definitely more high strung than usual, - and, honestly... - [distant growl] ...I'm into it. I love your sister, man. I love her shorts. [Gerrik] She's clearly wanting a bit of British penis. [Martin] Come on! [eerie music] Guys. Edgar? What's going on, man? You don't see her? See who? The girl she's... she's right here. You're freaking G out, man. You okay, man? [branch snapping] [ominous music] You all right, man? Yeah, I'm fine. [sighs] What did you say? I didn't say anything. What the fuck did you say? Are you sure you should take that many? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm okay. [Edgar] Guys, I'm fine. All right, man. I'm fine. Come on. Let's... Let's just go. Come on, bitch. - [Gerrik] I'm coming. - [chuckles] The sun's still out. Yeah, it is pretty strange. It's getting late. This is nice. You know, the city can get so... I don't know. Rushed. But this is... beautiful. Peaceful, you know? Clayton's not going to be much better, you know? [Darcy scoffs] I'm just saying. [Darcy] Yeah. Martin said you were pretty upset when he told you we were leaving. I'm not upset, I just know him. We won't ever see him around. [McKenzie] It's fine, though. I mean, once we get Marylyn back at home, he can do whatever he wants. You two moving in together, though. Seems pretty serious. Yeah, it is. Well, which is why I'd really like it if you and I could maybe spend some... Is that it? Yeah, looks like it. [sighs] Looks like we found it. - Where's Gerrik? - Um, he's coming. [foreboding music] [McKenzie] Marylyn! Marylyn! [knocking on door] You see anybody in there? Nah, man. This place looks like it hasn't been used in years. - [McKenzie groans] - [door knob rattling] I don't know, McKenzie, this is your thing. What do you want to do? Well, there's two other buildings, one there and one there. Martin, check one. Edgar, check the other. And we'll try to get in here. Okay, how do we do this? [ominous music] [Martin] Marylyn! I'll check this one down here. [Edgar] It's locked. [Edgar knocking on door] [foreboding music] [Edgar] Huh. Look who made it. That is the last time I'm going anywhere with you or your sister. How's that cigarette treating you at this altitude? [Gerrik] It's delicious. [Edgar] Come on, let's go see if the girls found anything. [sighs] Have you guys noticed that the sun is not going down? It's just kind of moving around? [McKenzie grunts] Everything's locked up tight. Now what? You know what? We should look around while it's still light out. Search for clues. Scooby Doo style. All right, Daphne. You go search for clues. I'm gonna set up my tent. All right, I'll check the surrounding area. You know, maybe Marylyn set up her camp somewhere. Wait somebody's stuff is in here. You know what, I got some eyeglass tools in my pack, that we could use to get the lock open. [Darcy] Or maybe there's like, a side window or something that has a screen we can pop out. Maybe we should try a back door? I feel like this place have a back door, right? - [gasps] - Fuck, Kenz! [Darcy] Oh, my god! I am so attracted to you right now. Martin's totally gonna want to see this. - [bag rasping] - [McKenzie sighs] [McKenzie] Damn it! It's empty. I mean, but it could be her's, though, I don't know. [Edgar] Look at this. [McKenzie] What is it? [Edgar] It's a ledger for everybody who's ever been here. A clue. Okay, well, do you see Marylyn's name? [Martin] Marylyn! Marylyn? All right, if you don't come out in the next minute, I'm gonna be forced to tell McKenzie about the time you had sex with Aaron Dorsey on her bed. Yeah, you're not out here, are you? I'm the only one out here, talking to myself. Yeah, this is great. [ominous music] - Boo! - Jesus! - [Darcy laughs] - [Martin shushes] Where is everybody? Oh! We got into the outpost. You should have seen McKenzie, she broke down the door, she's like, like Jack Nicholson when he swings that axe in The Shining. Caretaker's chest. Aah! Oh, it was so badass. - You are a dork. - [laughs] - Yeah, and? - Come on we should head back. No, I think that Scooby Doo and the rest of the gang will be okay without Fred and Daphne for a while. Oh, we're Fred and Daphne now? Duh! Daphne was fucking hot. Goddamn, she was. [chuckles] But Fred, he was... he was kind of a tool, though? No, he wasn't. He had that cute ascot. Uh-huh. Come on, we should head back. I mean, we could keep looking out here for a little lot longer. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. [both laugh] Maybe we should keep searching. I mean, there's so much ground to cover. [Darcy] Mm. Jesus. There's a lot of people here. Check to see who was the last to sign it. Gregory and Allison Scott. 1957. This place is weird. I mean this box, all these papers. Everything's dated back to 1957. These photos. Where did you get that? The guy from the restaurant gave it to me. He said his wife lost a necklace here or something. [McKenzie sighs] What? I saw her. [Martin exhales sharply] [Darcy moans] [Darcy] I love you, baby. [Darcy moaning] [Martin] God, you are so beautiful. [ominous music] [yells] What's wrong? What's wrong? [gasps] - What's wrong? - [panting] Nothing. I'm okay. You know, we've been gone a long time. We should get back. What do you mean you think you saw her? I saw... [stuttering] I don't know what I saw. Never mind. Nothing. Hey, Edgar? Mm-hm. Do you still have your tools? Because I want to open that box over there. Yeah. Look, I'm just very aware of all the breaking and entering that we're doing. I mean, somebody owns this place. Yeah, and that somebody will understand. Or do I have to go get the axe again? In case you're wondering, the sun is still out, and it's almost 11. [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] - [Edgar] Hey. - Hey. Did you guys find anything? No. Were you even looking? Yes, dick. We were doing something, other than just fucking sitting there. Cut off their heads. I told them to cut off their heads. [man #1] But they didn't listen. And now, look what happened! [gasps] Is anyone worried about the sun? It's almost midnight. What the fuck is going on? Where's McKenzie? She's, uh, up there in the outpost. [distant clatter] [McKenzie gagging] [gasps, gags] [panting] [Martin] What happened? - Huh? - [Edgar] You okay? Sorry. I thought I saw a rat or something. Okay. I don't get it. Why did Marylyn would ever come in here? I mean, look at this place. Well, she might, if there was a storm or something. I guess. Edgar, did you bring your tools, 'cause I really want to open this box. Why? Because, Gerrik, it's the last place I haven't checked and I want to look. All right, Lizzy Borden, want to open up another one? No. No, it's just a simple lock. Here. Look, we don't need to tear anything up. Grab that one. No, the other one. [Martin] All right. [chuckles] - What? - Uh... It just, uh... [Martin] It reminds me of that one Christmas when we were kids. When we broke into Mom and Dad's closet and saw all our Christmas presents? Yeah, fuck. It's less gratifying when find all your presents unwrapped like that at once. Yup, had to fake surprise the entire next morning. Oh, my god. And we had to act like we didn't find Mom's vibrator. [McKenzie snickers] [McKenzie] Uh, do you... All right, um, hold your steady. There's no way this works. [sighs] One... - two, three. - [clicks] It worked. You did it. [smooches] [Darcy] Where the hell did you learn how to do that? - That? - [Darcy] Hm. [Martin] Wouldn't you like to know? [suspenseful music] Is that... Yeah. You guys, when we were at the restaurant, that guy, Leon... he showed us this picture of his wife. Said he... She's missing a necklace. That's the necklace. [Edgar] You all should see this. What the fuck? What is that red line? Look, I'm no expert, but that looks a lot like... Blood? I'm gonna go get some water. [Darcy] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm dehydrated. Maybe we shouldn't have brought him on this trip. This is a little too much. [chains clank] [foreboding music] Yeah, I'll go get him. We'll build a fire. Do you have any matches? Yeah, they're in my bag. Hey, have you guys, um... Have you guys seen anything weird? Besides this creepy outpost with a backyard full of chains and blood, no. This is all normal. [eerie music] [distant disembodied voice] [disembodied voice continues] Martin, what the fuck are you doing? He's grabbing the matches from my.... Fuck. [gasps] - What is this? - What do you mean? What the fuck is this, McKenzie? The guy at the restaurant. He gave you this shit? It's nothing, Martin. It's just stupid... [McKenzie] No! - [plops] - No! Martin! You don't understand. We need those! Martin, what's wrong? She tore out the pages to Marylyn's journal. She didn't want us to see this. There's something dangerous in these woods. Uh, what do you mean? [ominous music] Marylyn said that a ton of people have gone missing in this forest. Why didn't you tell us this, McKenzie? I didn't believe any of it. I didn't... I mean, the shit the guy at the restaurant was saying, it sounded ridiculous. [gasps] But I don't think it is. I think it's all real, and... This place is dangerous. I don't think we are where we think we are. Where are we? Another world. [disembodied screech] Pack the stuff, we're leaving. [McKenzie] Martin, please don't... Don't you fucking touch me. You believe this shit? I don't know, man, do you? I think I'd rather be the guy who believes it and nothing happens than the other way around. Pack up the stuff, we're leaving in ten. - [Martin] Come on. - Darcy, please. No, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay. I know, I know, I know I fucked up. I should have just told you from the start. [sighs] But it's Marylyn. Marylyn's out there and she's in danger. All of us are in danger now, McKenzie. Take a look outside. There is something strange about this place. Now we will find Marylyn. But first, we need to get out of here, and we need to figure out what to do. Martin, please! Fuck! Fuck! Fine, if you guys wanna just go ahead and leave that's fine! Okay. But you are not going to be able to find the door without me. Leave? Why would we leave? We just got here. I'm about to cook up some food. You hungry? You know what, I'll get another one. Here you go, McKenzie. Where's Edgar? Edgar? He's at home recovering. With my mom. No. What are you guys talking about? His bag is right there. - No, that's my bag. - That's not his bag. Where's Edgar? Ooh. Does McKenzie have a little thing for Edgar? You know what? Next time, I'll bring him just for you. [all laugh] What's wrong with you, sis? Sit down. Come on. - [all laughing] - [McKenzie gasps] Edgar! Hey, grab some firewood while you're down there, I don't have too much. [Gerrik] I swear to god she's stoned. I knew that she had a thing for him. Fuck. [sighs] Okay. Okay. - [phone beeping] - [panting] [owl hooting] [gasps] Come on, come on, come on. [phone beeps] Uh, hello? You believe me now, don't you? - Yes. - [Leon] That's good. Now we can get to work. [Leon] Did you find the necklace? Yes, I found it. I got it. That's good. Have you seen her? No, Marylyn's not even here. And my friends, there's something wrong with them. They're all confused. They don't even... They don't even know where we are. Well, they're coming for you. You've been in there too long. Who's coming? [Leon] The pale ones. The one's messing with your friend's minds. Where the fuck is my sister? You said that she was here. [Leon] She must have left. I can help you find her. But you need to get your friends. You need to give them the vial. You need to get out of there. You're running out of time. They're coming. My friend Edgar, he's missing. [Leon] Find him. Then call me back. [foreboding music] [gasps] [growling] [panting] [McKenzie] Martin. Martin. Where's Darcy? Darcy, she's, uh... Here, drink this. Okay. Where's Darcy? Oh, thank, god. I don't know. I couldn't find Edgar, either. What happened to us? [distant shriek] - You hear that? - What is that? - It sounds like screaming. - [distant screams] - Oh, my god. - [Darcy] Help! Darcy. [suspenseful music] [sobbing, screams] [Gerrik screams] Go! Fucking go with Martin! Fuck! [Darcy whimpers] Please, stop! Please! [whimpers] We know what you are. We know what you are! You fucked him didn't you? You fucked him. [Martin] Let her go! I can smell it on you! You fucked him. I can smell it on you. You fucking disgust me! - [Darcy sobbing] - [Edgar] I can smell it on you. [Darcy] No, please don't. Please don't. [Darcy weeping] Edgar, stop! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please, this man's gone crazy! - Please! - Edgar. - Stop. - Please! Please, stop! Distract him. [Edgar] You have the devil inside you. - [McKenzie] Edgar! - On three. Edgar, no, no, no. [Edgar] They're gonna hunt you all down. [McKenzie] Look at me. Martin. One. - They're gonna rip you open. - [sobbing] No! Martin! Edgar! Two. - And devour you... - [Darcy] Edgar, please. ...from the inside. - Three! - [Darcy screams] [Martin grunting] [Martin] No! No! No! [Gerrik] Go help him. I'm fine. I'm fine. Help him with the door. I'm fine. Help him with the fucking door! [Gerrik panting] [Gerrik grunts] Shit! [grunts, pants] [Martin] You gotta put pressure on it. Try to be still. It'll bleed more if you move. - [Darcy groaning] - [Martin shushes] Try not to move, baby. [Darcy panting, grunting] I don't know what to do. We have to get her to a hospital. Right now. [panting] Who are you? Who are you people? Who are you people? Do you have any more of those vials? I only have one more. - Get it! - [McKenzie] Okay. Okay. - [Darcy gasps] - [Martin shushes] [Gerrik grunts] Breathe. Just breathe. [panting] What... - [Martin] Give me that! - What about Edgar? [Martin] Drink this. - It'll help you. - [McKenzie] God. Hey. Hey. - [Martin] You okay? - My ankle is broken. Don't worry about me. Fix Darcy. [Gerrik groans] Where's Edgar? He went crazy. We had to lock him up, okay? He's having a manic episode. He's... He's not crazy. It's just... We need to help him. No, that's not what this is. Fucking, it's something else. [stutters] Somebody, help me! - Breathe. - [Darcy whimpering] Hey, don't get too close to him. [Martin] Shh, look at me. Breathe. [Edgar] Please! [Edgar panting] McKenzie. McKenzie, you're freaking me out. Please tell me what is going on. Why am I chained up? [stammers] There's blood all over my hands. [Edgar] Okay, please. Please. McKenzie, just talk to me. Tell me what's going on. Please. You don't remember? Huh? No, I don't. Remember what? Did something happen? Did I... Did I do something? McKenzie, what happened? You're freaking me out! [stammers] There's a fucking bite on my hand! Where's Martin? McKenzie... McKenzie, where's Darcy? Please, help. Where's Darcy? [Edgar] No. No, don't go. Please. I don't remember. I don't remember. Please, just talk to me! McKenzie, just talk to me, please! I don't remember. I don't remember. [sobs] What the fuck is going on? [grunts] [Edgar] Oh, fuck! How is he? I mean, he doesn't remember a thing. [Edgar] Please! Help me! He seems completely fine, Martin. Yeah, well, he's not! And neither is she. He is chained up, he can't hurt anyone else or himself. Now we need to get her to a hospital. Fuck it! Help me! All right, baby, listen to me. We're gonna lift you up really slow, okay? I'm gonna get you out of here. One... Two... - Three. - [Darcy screams] [Darcy grunting] We can't be moving her. You have to run for help. You know where the portal is. I'll keep after these three. You get to that car, and you drive as fast as you can, and you call for help. - [Martin] Okay? - Okay. [McKenzie] Okay. [McKenzie sighs] - [Darcy shrieks] - [Martin shushes] Shit. Fuck! Shut it! Check that window! [Martin] Check that window! Please don't jump out. Please don't jump out. Nope. There's nothing there. What the fuck was that thing? It was his wife. From the picture? What the fuck is wrong with her? I don't know. What do we do? [Martin] Does that work here? Call 911. Have them pin our location and send an ambulance. Oh, fuck that. Tell them send a goddamn helicopter. - Get us off this mountain! - Okay! Uh, 911? Yes, we're in Cinder National Park. Two of my friends are very badly injured. We need medical assistance, please. [Leon] Hey, kid. Leon? [Leon] Did you find Edgar? Something's wrong with him. He went crazy. He attacked one of us. Put it on speaker. [Leon] Have you seen my wife? She's out there. [McKenzie] Somewhere. I thought you said that they wouldn't be able to make us see things, if we drank the vials. [Leon] The drink will keep the visions out. She's not a vision, she's real. A demon's inside her, like your friend. Well, how do we get it out of him? [Leon] You can't. You need to leave. Go to the portal. Where is Marylyn? Where the fuck is our sister? She was never here, was she? [Leon] No. But I can show you where she is, if you bring me the necklace. Go to the portal, I'll have someone meet you there. Go now. Portal? He lied to me. She was never here. What does he mean by portal? It's the way that we came in. The path that we turned off on. It's like a door. Is that how you had me walk first? Oh, you fucking bitch. - [McKenzie] Shut up! - Enough! Enough! Both of you. Now, we need to focus on what we do now. Huh? I'll make a run for it. Just take this. Keep trying, and tell him to send help. [sighs] [foreboding music] [Martin] Hey. [Martin] McKenzie went to get help, okay? [Darcy moans] That hurts. I know. I know, but yeah, you're gonna be fine. - Okay? - [Darcy panting] Look at me. I promise you. You're good. [pants] Where's Edgar? Is he okay? Yeah. Uh... We had to lock him up, but he can't hurt anyone. Okay? - [whimpers] - [Martin] Shh. It wasn't him. He didn't mean to do it. - He's sick. He's sick. - Oh, I know. I know. It's not him. [Darcy panting] [foreboding music] Please. [sniffs] McKenzie went to get help. Martin, please. [chains rattle] Please take me out of these chains, man. What's in you, man? Huh? Is it... [ominous music] [panting] [whimpers] Oh, fuck! It burns! Oh, god, Martin, it burns. It burns on the inside! Martin. [Edgar groans] [in demonic language] They're coming for you. Eddie! [in demonic language] Run. Run. They're coming for you. [in English] They're coming for you! [laughs] Run! They're coming for you! Goddamn it, Darcy, what are you doing? I want to see him. He didn't mean to do it, please. [grunts, pants] Where the fuck is Gerrik? Listen to me. I need you to stay here. Gerrik! Gerrik? You promised me. You said you loved me. I never loved you. You left me. You disgusted me. I couldn't look at you any longer. Why? You're worthless. Who would love someone like you? [sobs] You. You said you loved me. I lied. No one loves you. No one loves you. My friends do. Where are they? Helping Darcy. They're not helping you. Come with me. Where? I'll show you. I'll show you. [foreboding music] Gerrik! [keypad beeping] Hello? Hello? Listen, man, I know you're there. Hello? [warbling] Fuck. Listen to me. I need you to stay here. I'll be right back. [groans] [whimpering] [pants] [gasps] Oh, Marylyn. [sobbing] Are you okay? Marylyn. Okay. Okay. [laughs] [panting] [gasps] [gasps] Gerrik! [Edgar] Darcy! [panting] Edgar. [grunts] - [panting] - [Edgar moaning] [Edgar] Darcy, please! Darcy, help me! Help me, please. - [panting] - [Edgar whimpers] [grunts] [Edgar] Darcy. Please help me. [grunts] Gerrik! [phone buzzing] [beeps] Leon. Look, man. I know that whatever is happening out here, is way bigger than all of us. My fiancée, she is hurt really bad. She needs help, man, or she's not gonna make it. [Darcy grunts] Darcy, what happened? Darcy, are you okay? What happened? [thuds] [sobbing] I'm so sorry... Oh, god, what is wrong with me? Just fucking kill me now. I can't take this. I can't take it. - It's okay. Shh. - [Edgar sobs] It's okay, I'm okay. I know it's not you. I would never hurt you, Darcy, I'm so sorry. I would never. You're just sick. [sobs] I'm so... What's wrong with me? They put me in fucking chains, Darcy! What is wrong with me? You just scared... You scared them. But I'm fine now. I'm fine. I'm fine. Please. I know. Please, let me out. I can't stay in these fucking chains anymore. They're driving me, they're driving me crazy. Please, Darcy. If I don't get out, I'm gonna die. How? I don't... I don't have the key. The axe. Darcy, get the axe. Man, you got what you wanted. And I am sorry about your wife. [thuds] But our friend... Man, there's something in him, and I don't know how to help him. [Leon] You can't help him. You can do it. [axe rattling] [grunts] - You can do it. - [Leon] A demon is eating him from the inside. Come on, man. There's got to be something I can do. [Leon] You can cut off his head. Or you can burn him. Otherwise, he won't stop coming for you. [panting] I don't think I could do it. You got it. [panting] - [grunts] - [thuds] Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Don't. I can't. It hurts so bad. [sobs] [sighs] This is all my fault. Everything is my fault. Everything. [sobbing] [Edgar] I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay. Shh. [Edgar sobbing] You're gonna be okay. Shh. [sniffles] Will you hold me? - [Edgar] I got you. - [Darcy grunts] Come here. I got you. Come here. I got you. [sighs] [Edgar] Do you remember when we were younger? And mom and dad would fight, and they would yell. And you'd get so scared. And you'd come into my room and, uh... And I would hold you just like this. [whimpers] I remember. [Edgar] You remember that? [sniffles] - It's gonna be okay. - Mm-hm. Yeah. - You're gonna be okay. - [both sob] They're getting us out. [sighs] [Darcy] You gotta believe me. They will. They went to get us out. No, they're not. [sniffles] It won't let you go. [chains rattle] [gags] [Darcy gasping] [tense music] [grunts] - [bone cracks] - [grunts] Please, man. [Leon] You must try to get out of there. I'd love to know all that you've seen. [ominous music] Darcy. Darcy... No. No. Darcy? [panting] [grunts] [yells] [panting] [crunches] [knife piercing flesh] [Edgar grunts] [sighs] Oh, my god. We can't leave. [ominous music] [thuds] [coughs] [pants] [sobbing] - [smacks] - [McKenzie grunts] You fucking cunt! [grunts] [screams] [sobs, grunts] [panting] [both panting] Ow! Why did you kick me? Darcy, stay away from him. - Darcy? - That's not Darcy. - [axe pierces flesh] - [grunts] [sloshes] Go, go, go. Go! [panting] What? No. Don't stop. We can't stop. This is it! This is where we turned off. [panting] Where's Darcy? What was that? That was not Darcy. I don't know what that was, but it was not her. She's dead. Edgar killed her. - I'm sorry, Martin. - [Martin] Oh, god, Darcy. [McKenzie whimpers] I'm so sorry, Martin. This is all my fault. [sobbing] I'm so sorry. It is not your fault. Look at me. - He lied to you. - [sobbing] But Marylyn. She's gotta be... She's gotta be in here. We'll find her. We're gonna find Marylyn. And we're gonna make that motherfucker pay for putting us in here. No, he's the only one who can help us. He's the only one who can get us out. We have to call him. Cellphone. What? I left it. - I need to go get it. - [McKenzie] No, no, no. I can figure it out. I can find it, okay? I can find it. Just give me a minute - to think about it first. - Just shut up. Shut up. [pants, whimpers] [gasps] What do we do? - You stay here. - No. I'm faster. I can get to the phone by myself. Okay? Don't go back. I love you sis. I'm sorry. [sobbing] - Please. - Just stay here. Martin, I'm sorry. - Please. - I'm gonna be right back. No, Martin, don't leave me. [sobbing] [whimpers] [twig snaps] [pants] Aah! [soil rasping] [panting] Martin! Kenz. Martin! She's in there! - McKenzie! - I'm here! [McKenzie] I'm right here! Kenz? [panting] - McKenzie? - I'm here! Where did you go Kenz? Come on. Martin! [panting] [hunter #1] He can't see you. - Why not? - Well, he's in there. You can't see the real world in there. Martin, I'm right here! Here, let me help you. [gasps] Ow. Ow, no. [groans] [whimpers] What did you do? Still can't hear you. [grunts] No. [sobs] [McKenzie] Stop! Stop! [panting] No. [grunting] - [thuds] - [McKenzie groans] Whoo-hoo! [chuckles] Feisty one. Jesus Christ, man. We don't have all fucking day. - No! - I might hold on to her. [McKenzie whimpers] [hunter #2] Oh, god. Don't make me. [hunter #1] Well, then help! This is fucking pathetic. - [thuds] - [McKenzie whimpers] [hunter #1] Try the cross again. [hunter #3] I think she's clean. [hunter #1] Did I ask what you think? [hunter #2] Uh... I think I'm gonna burn her. [hunter #3] No, we're waiting for Leon for that. [grunts, pants] [hunter #3] Hm. She's awake. Help. [pants] Here. Have a sip. You know those tranqs can really dry you out. There you go. [pants] [hunter #1 clears throat] Now this is gonna hurt a bit. No! No, no, no! Please! Please! Please! - [screams] - [sizzles] [yells, sobs] [McKenzie sobbing] Goddamn it, I thought I told you to wait. And I told you not to use Andrew's boys anymore. How are you feeling, sweetheart? - [spits] - Oh. - [thwacks] - [panting] You do that again, you're gonna be spitting up blood and teeth. It's fine. It's fine. I guess I deserved that. Where are we? Those things in the forest... Don't worry. We're far outside Cinder Park. We're safe here, we're outside the portal. - What were they? - We call them Drogyr. - What do you call them boys? - Pale fuckers. See, everybody's got their names for 'em. They're body possessors. That's why we needed to do all this. We needed to make sure that you were you, and not something else. Hm? If my brother's dead because of you... I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill all of you. I like this girl. Now you hold your horses. Your brother's alive. He called me just as I was on the way over here. [hunter #2] Okay, Leon. This has been fun and all, but you know. The Carousel's starting soon and we got to go. Untie her, Charl. And you keep an eye on her, okay? [Leon] So, which Axiom is it this year, boys? Number four. So we need something that's gonna put those big motherfuckers to sleep. - [hunter #2] Something... - [Leon] Nothing's gonna put - a Leviathan to sleep. - [handcuffs click] [groans] Oh, you know, I might have something. [sighs] The boys around these parts like to hold competitions. They go into the different Axioms and, uh, try to survive or see what creatures they can kill. Those doors, there's more than one? Oh, yeah. There are a few. A couple of sprays of this, they won't know you're there. Like bug spray. Just don't get stepped on. [hunter #2] Oh. Thank you, kindly. Now you do know this is considered cheating, right? Well, we won't tell anyone if you don't. You people are sick. You know what's in there, and you just let people go in? [Leon] Now, now. We've all lost people in the Axiom. - [grunts] - [groans] My wife. How could you let her go in there? I didn't let her go in. I put her in there. Why? Well, now, McKenzie, that is none of your business. That's between me, and Jessica, and a man no one's gonna see again. Did you put Marylyn in there? I sure did. [Leon grunts] You son of a fucking bitch! - [McKenzie yells] - [Charl] Hey! - [gun cocks] - [McKenzie pants] Take it easy now, little lady. You put her in there? Well, first, we started with her friends. But we chose a door with a really special beast. I mean this thing is a natural born killer, a real hunter. So one by one, we put Marylyn's friends in there. [Leon] Each time, it takes the bait. And then I chained Marylyn there. Damn it, three weeks later, it still hasn't killed her. I knew your sister was special. I think we can have us some fun. [gasps] You see. Marylyn's still alive. And your brother's still alive. I mean, there's still time, we could save one of them. Question is, which one do you wanna save? One? Well, they're both still alive, but they're in different Axioms. Who do you want to save? [sighs] [ominous music] I think you're making the right choice. Shut up. I guess it's like a sisters thing. I wouldn't understand. I said shut the fuck up! We're going to get Martin right after we save Marylyn. Where did it come from? The Axiom. Well, the story goes, it showed up in the '50s. Government came up here. They took over the land, started doing tests. Then one day, they just up and left. [Leon] Some boys found a doorway. Then they found another. You know, people go missing in national parks all the time. Most of them are found, but some... Some just disappear off the face of the Earth. How many doors are there? We've found six. And what's in the other Axioms? All kinds of beasts. Monsters. Who knows about this? Well, us locals, you know, keep it a secret. If the government finds out, they'd come up here again. They'd take our land, they'd take our houses. Sometimes, secrets get out. Cinder Falls there, there. There's a door. Oh, no. No, your sister's not in there. Those boys with the painted faces, they're in there. Competing in carousel. Oh... Creatures in there. Mighty big. Cinder peak. We're here. Portal's straight through there. You just follow the lights. And what's in there? We call it the Rapax. As long as it's off hunting, you should be okay. You're not coming in with me? Sorry, hun. This is as far as my help extends. Give me your gun. [scoffs] Nice try, kid. Here, I'll give you this flashlight. It gets very dark in there. Now you listen to me. You get in there fast, you might just get out. And what if I see it? Well, like I said... let's just hope it's off hunting. [panting] [flashlight clicks] [panting] [foreboding music] [foreboding music continues] [panting] Marylyn? Marylyn! - Marylyn! - [Marylyn pants] Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here. Were you bad, too? No, no, no. I'm here to help you, okay? [sobbing] We were bad... We're bad, that's why we're here. [panting] - Okay. - [Marylyn whimpers] [chains rattling] - I can't get it. - No! No! - Shh. - He will punish me. - I'll be right back. - No... I'm going somewhere and I'm going to get something. - I'll be right back. - No! I will be right back. Shh. [Marylyn sobs] [door knob squeaks, clicks] [tense music] [rasps] - [approaching footsteps] - Okay. Okay. [distant growl] - Shh. - [Marylyn] Oh, he's... - He's coming. - Shh! Shh! He's coming! - He's coming! - Shh! [in soft voice] Shut up. [rasping] [Rapax growling] - [snarls] - [gasps] Oh, no... Oh, no. [McKenzie grunts] [grunting continues] I can't get it. You can't leave. - You can't leave. - Shh. I'm not gonna leave, okay? I'm not gonna leave. I just need something bigger. - Where is it? - No. No. It won't let us leave. We'll be here... We'll be here forever. [panting] No. Marylyn, you can't. - [mumbles] - No, no! Please, no! Please, no. No! What did you do? What did you do? No! No... - [thuds] - [gasps] - [sobbing] - [snarls] [growls] [growls] [flashlight clicks] [tense music] [snarls] [Leon] Oh, baby. Baby, I'm sorry. [sighs] I'm so fucking sorry. [phone chimes] Aw. Poor girl. - [light clicks] - Jesus! [gun cocks] Drive. Oh, god. Oh, no. [gasps] Oh, fuck. [panting] We shouldn't be in here without drinking the vials. - Walk! - Oh, no. Oh, no. Fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No, no. Fuck! They're fucking everywhere! They're in my fucking head! They're fucking everywhere! They're fucking everywhere! They're coming! They're fucking everywhere! They're fucking every, fucking, where. Hey. I had you fooled there for a moment, didn't I? Eh? I got my fucking freak on. [chuckles] You know... it's been a fun ride, kid. But this, this is the end of the fucking ride. [gun clicks] [approaching footsteps] Hey. Hey. Hey, Jessie. [Leon] Hey, Jess. Hey, babe. [stammers] It's good to see you. [panting] Martin! Martin! [sobs] [whimpers] No. Please, Martin! I came back. [panting] I'm back. [sobs] [panting] I'm done. I'm done. I'm done! Do you hear me? Come, take me! Take me! [panting] [grunts] [panting] [sniffles] Come and get me. [pants] [sniffles, sobs] Martin. Oh, Martin. Oh, thank god. Let's go. Come on. I can't believe it. You came back for me. [Martin sighs] Of course. We thought we'd lost you. - [knife pierces flesh] - [groans] [gasps] [groans] [whimpers] [thuds] [McKenzie grunts] [groans] [eerie music] Subtitles by explosiveskull
