Before I send everyone off to their warm homes, I have an announcement. There was a fire at St. Jerome's home for children last night. As you can imagine, there are many children without a place to stay. Considering it is the season for giving, I'm hoping that some of you will consider opening your homes to a child for the holidays, or even until St. Jerome's can be built. They've been calling everyone that has been vetted to foster in the past 10 years, but still are in need. If you can find it in your hearts and have the space, please go down to silver creek elementary school for more information, the children are set up in a temporary shelter in the gymnasium. Who knows? You might even decide to foster or adopt a child. Please rise. Be people with joy. Let joy live in your heart and share the joy of Christ with those in need. See joy in the good with each other. Share joy by seeing the good in each other. Share joy by remembering good times, and hoping in the good times to come. Share joy by praying for our world. In this advent season, we need to see, feel, and share joy. As you go out into the wonder of god's creation, share joy, peace, and hope with those in need. Amen. Amen. Go forth in peace and have a great week! This is so sad. I know. Those poor kids. Yeah, it's a real shame. I'm gonna see if uncle Vic will take in some. Kids? Yeah. Why not? Maggie, you barely have enough room for your family at that house. There's nothing wrong with where I live, Jesse. That's not what I meant. It's just, it's you, your mom, Vic, Rosie, Martha. There's a lot of us, I know. Yeah, you share a room with your 14 year old sister. So? Do you really have enough rooms for another kid? Aunt Rosie and uncle Vic adopted Agnes and merit after we moved in with them. We've always found room, especially for those in need. You and your dad should take some in. Some? No, no way. Why not? I don't like kids, Maggie. You like Martha. That's different. She's like my little sister. So? She's still a kid and a teenager, no less. Yeah, but I've known her since she was born. It doesn't matter. You'd be doing something good and for Christmas. Which also happens to be my birthday. Even more of a reason to take some kids in. You have plenty of room. So? So, open your home to at least one child without a family. Maggie, please don't guilt trip me. I'm not guilting you. You have two bedrooms. That's enough room to take in siblings. Look, I'm an only child. So? So, I'm not the biggest fan of sharing. I don't mean you getting siblings. I mean taking in siblings from foster care so that they don't have to be separated. Kids aren't gonna wanna live with dad and me. You're being ridiculous. At least think about it. Okay. I'll think about it. And I'll talk to your dad. You're impossible. Look like cousins, they don't have the spots. That's true. - You should adopt one. - Hey, Lydia, Jimmy. - Hey. - Hey. Who are these two? This is Josie. And this is Tim. And they were living at St. Jerome's until last night. There was a really big fire. We heard about it at church this morning. I'm so sorry. It must've been really scary. It was. I wasn't scared. Is that right? Well, I'm sure you're very brave, Tim. No, he wasn't. I saw him crying. Was not! Were too. Nuh-uh, smoke got in my eyes. Hey now, no arguing. Can we join you for breakfast? We just finished. We're just waiting on our bill now. I'll take care of it. Really? You don't have to do that. It's the least I can do. It's really nice of you guys to take these kids out to breakfast. So, my treat. They're doing more than that. We live with them now. Really? Sort of. It's not for good. I live upstairs with Jake and Mr. and Mrs. Potter. John moved into the other bedroom in the basement with me. Yeah, I have a boys room, but that's okay. I don't mind. It's nice having my own room for a change, even if it's just for Christmas. And what about you, Tim? Are you staying with Jimmy? I got my own room too. He's staying in the guest room. It's blue. That's my favorite color. Yes, it is. All right, so what about you two? What about us? Are you taking anyone in? There are still so many kids that need somewhere to stay. I want to. I need to talk to my family. I don't know if we have enough space. What about you, Jesse? Yeah, isn't it just you and your dad in that big house? I don't know. I mean- - here you go. Sorry for the wait. I'll take that, Laudine. Do you two need a table? Yes, please. Follow me. Nice meeting you kids. Thanks for breakfast. - Yeah, thank you, Jesse. - Thank you. I'll be right over, Jesse. Is he okay? I am not sure. If you guys need anything, just let me know, okay? My name is Maggie and that's Jesse over there. Is he your boyfriend? Yes, he is. Apparently I'm taking care of three kids now. See you guys later. That's really nice of the Potters and the Capernaums. Yeah, yeah it is. You have way more room in your house than they do, you know. Yeah, so? So, maybe you could take a couple of kids in. Maggie, I like things the way that they are. Maybe you should do something unpredictable. What's wrong with predictable? It's okay to change things up every once in a while, Jess. Take breakfast for instance. You always get the cinnamon bun pancakes. I like the cinnamon bun pancakes. You could choose something else and still be happy with it. It's not like getting something different is gonna be a huge inconvenience for you. Especially when your friends are trying something new and your girlfriend is supporting you. I suddenly feel like we're not talking about pancakes. Jess, I don't mean to nag. So don't. But this is really important to me. You know how I feel about kids. And you know how I feel, Maggie. I'm not ready for kids. I don't know if I ever will be. And even then I only want one. That's because you've never been around children before. Sure, I have. No, you haven't. Like you said, you're an only child. You've never had that experience. Maybe taking a couple of kids in for Christmas would be a good way to decide if you want children of your own. If I say I'll think about it can we at least move on, please? Yes. I'll think about it. Will you really? Yes, I will think about it. Promise. I promise. Thank you. Dad, I'm home. I'm in the kitchen! Hey, dad. Hey, Jesse. - You want some coffee? - No, thanks. Maggie and I just had brunch. Oh, I was wondering what took you so long. Oh, sorry. I should have called. That's all right. I got some stuff done. Now you heard about St. Jerome. Yeah, pastor Luke was talking about it. It's really sad. It is. It is. Oh, and we saw Lydia and Jimmy. I think they're taking in a couple of the kids. You know, it's funny that you should mention that. Don't tell me you're on the kid kick too. Well- - I don't wanna take in any of the kids, dad. Come on. Jess- - we need this like we need matching root canals, dad. - Jesse! - What? Meet Abigail and David. They'll be staying with us for awhile. Hey, kids! Welcome. Told you no one wanted us. Hey, can I have more milk, please? Abigail, can I come in? It's your house. You can do whatever you want. That's not very nice. In this house, we're respectful to one another. I might not be your dad, but I am your guardian for the time being. I need you to show respect. Can you do that? I guess. Right now this is your room and I respect your space and I'm not gonna come inside unless you allow it. Really? Yes, really. So may I come in? Yeah. So, that's Jesse. I noticed. Sorry. It's all right. Hey, listen. We don't know how long we're gonna be here and we're just starting to learn about each other. I don't think Jesse wants us here. Oh, he's just surprised is all. He'll come around. Can I come in? Will you give him a chance? He's really not a bad guy. Be nice to her. She's been through a lot. So, may I come in? Yeah, sure. So, Abigail- - that's me. Can I call you Abby? No. Only my brother calls me Abby. Okay. Abigail it is. Is Jesse short for something? No, just Jesse. Listen, I didn't mean what I said down there. Sure you did. You just got caught. Hey, I'm trying- - what? It's true. If David and I weren't there, you still would have said those things. I guess. And you meant it. How old are you, like 12? 14. I'll be 15 in February. Are you sure you're not turning 40? What? Nothing. Nevermind. You know, I really think we got off on the wrong foot. You can say that again. Listen, I'm really trying here, Abigail, all right? Look, I'm really sorry for what I said and I'm sorry that you heard me. So, you're sorry that you got caught. Right. You and David are welcome here for Christmas. Really? Yes. My girlfriend, Maggie, actually wants to take in some kids too and she doesn't even have room in her house. Does she have a big family? Yup. Lucky. Yeah. I guess she is. I wouldn't know. I'm an only child. Your dad told me your mom died in march. She did. Mine did too, then my dad. I'm sorry to hear that. I was 10. David was seven. No one wants to take in two foster kids, so. That can't be true. It is. Even people who knew our parents didn't take us. We bounced from house to house until we landed in st Jerome's and now that's gone too. Don't you have any family? My parents were only children. What about your grandparents? Green rock cemetery. I just keep putting my foot in my mouth, don't I? Look, you don't want us here. I get it. I'm sure we can find somewhere else to go. No, no, no, no. You're very, very welcome here. Really? Absolutely. Okay, well I promise we'll stay out of your way and we won't touch your stuff. We probably will eat your food though. You're not gonna be in my way. I was being a real jerk, all right? I'm sorry. It's fine. Good. Come on. Hey, everything okay? Yeah, I think so. - Abigail? - Yeah, we're good. Can we go outside? David, it's freezing out. I wanna build a snow fort. You don't even have a coat warm enough to play in the snow. It's not that cold. It's like 20 degrees. You're not my mom! - Hey. - Okay, okay. Why don't you guys go upstairs and unpack first and we'll see what you have. Oh, man. I'll take you outside to build a snow fort. You will? - You will? - You will? Don't be so surprised. John, Jimmy, and I used to build the best snow forts whenever it snowed. I've never built one before, ever! Really? Yeah, they wouldn't let us outside long enough at St. Jerome's. I think the closest we got to building a snowman was like two big snowballs. Yeah, and then they would make us go inside so we didn't get sick. Aw, that's too bad. Well, today's your lucky day, kid. I'm gonna show you how to build the best snow fort. Awesome! Just go put your clothes away and we can go outside. I don't wanna go outside. Well, maybe you'd like to go shopping for some warmer clothes? Shopping? See, I don't know if you noticed, but I don't have any money. Don't worry about that. Seriously? Yeah. Consider it a peace offering. Deal. Come on. Come on, Abby. Shh! What are you doing? They have to be calling miss Tubbins for money for us. Look at this house. They don't need us for money. Why else would they take us in, David? Double the kids, double the money from the state. That's not nice. Yeah, well it's true. You have to stop trusting people so fast. Not everyone's nice. Not everyone's mean. Just because the Osborne's took us in for money doesn't mean that everyone else will. Well, you can't be too careful. Just go upstairs. I'm gonna listen for a minute. Don't get in trouble. I won't unless I get caught or you tell on me. I'm not telling. Then go put your clothes away. I know, I know, okay? I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize to me. I already apologized to Abigail. And David? I think building a snow fort outside with him is an apology enough. Okay, okay. I'll have a heart to heart with him too. It was not a very good introduction, Jesse. Yeah, I know. You know your mom and I, we thought about adopting before you were born. You did? Yeah, well, we didn't think we could conceive naturally. And why do you think you were an only child? I mean, we wanted to have more than one kid. Really? Yeah. We didn't want you to think that you weren't good enough for us, but after you graduated college, we signed up to be foster parents. What? I had no idea. Yeah, well it's because soon thereafter your mom was diagnosed and we put ourselves on inactive status until she went into remission. But she never did. Jesse, your mom would have been first in line to help these kids out. She would've taken them all in if she could, especially at Christmas. You're not seriously pulling out the mom card, are you, dad? It's all true, Jesse. These kids, they're staying. It's what your mom would have wanted. This just might be the last Christmas gift we can give her. Hey, David, how's it going? Okay, I guess. I mean, I don't really have any clothes that are warm enough. Don't you have any snow pants? Snow pants? What are those? Pants that go over your clothes so that you don't get wet. So like a wetsuit? Kinda, only for snow. And they're a lot thicker and you gotta wear your clothes underneath them. So not like a wetsuit at all. I mean, they both keep you from getting cold. More like a dry suit. Haven't you ever been skiing? No. Snowboarding? No. I mean, I've seen it on television though. Well what about sledding? Yeah, I've been sledding a couple of times. Well, what did you wear? Mm, just my sweatpants. Didn't you get all wet and cold? Yeah. I mean... Yeah, and then miss Tubbins told us to go inside. I guess you didn't really have that much fun at St. Jerome's. Hmm. I mean, it was okay. I liked living at home a lot better with my parents. I don't know. I just couldn't remember it that much. You were pretty young when they died, huh? Yeah. I mean, I still kind of remember what they look like and I always carry this around so I always remember. I'll tell you what, why don't we put this right here so that they can see your whole room. So this is really all mine? The room? Yeah. Absolutely. It's all yours, man. So I get this while I'm here, right? Right. Hey, as long as you're here, this place is David's den. David's den. I like that. Tell you what, why don't we go get your sister and we can head to the shops at east wind. Foster kids aren't allowed there. Of course they are. Really? For what? To go shopping. What about thrift shopping? What do you mean? I mean, the last time family that we lived with told us that foster kids can only go to the thrift shop and only when they really need to. Well, that's terrible and that's a lie. It is? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Come on. Let's go get your sister. Hey, come on. Let's go. Where are we going? We're going to the shops at east wind. Why? We're gonna go shopping. I thought foster kids weren't allowed to go there. Yeah, well now they are. Are you sure? Absolutely. We don't have any money. That's okay. I do. I can't really pay you back till I'm like 40. I don't need you to pay me back. Consider it an early Christmas present. Awesome. Christmas isn't for another two weeks. Oh, which reminds me. We need to get you guys some Christmas clothes for church. You're really gonna let us stay until Christmas? You can stay as long as you need to. So, like, until St. Jerome's gets rebuilt, right? Yeah, exactly. If you say so. I do. So come on. I gotta go get changed first. Don't ruin this, Abby. I mean, we have a chance of getting a nice Christmas for once. Why? Everything's just gonna disappear when we go back to the orphanage. It's not an orphanage. It's just a home for kids. Potato, potato. Come on. Let's go, Abby. Hey, I'm taking the kids to the mall, dad. Well, that's really a change of attitude. Well, if you can't beat them, join them. Maybe you should take Maggie with you. Why? You're really gonna go clothes shopping for a 14 year old girl? Good point. - See ya. - See ya. Hi Jesse. Miss me already? You have no idea. What's up? Well, my dad decided to take in a couple of kids from St. Jerome's. Jesse, that's so great. Yeah. Great. Unfortunately, they lost all of their belongings in the fire. Oh, that's terrible. Those poor kids. Yeah. So I'm gonna take them shopping. And you want me to come with you? Yes, please. Martha can come to. Martha? Why? Well, we have a brother and a sister here. David is 10 and Abigail's 14, same age as Martha. Ah, well say no more. I'm sure Martha would love to come. Great. Thank you. Do you want us to meet you there? Yeah, yeah. I guess I should get to know the kids a little bit. Okay, when? A half hour? Park in the south parking lot and I'll find you. Sounds good. Great. Thanks, Maggie. See you in a few. Bye. I would love to go where? The shops at east wind. With who? It's shopping, Martha. You love shopping. Yeah, but with who? Jesse took in two foster kids. The girl, Abigail, is your age. Does she go to my school? I don't know. I didn't ask. Well, if she lives with Jesse, she has to, right? I suppose. Why don't you ask her yourself? I will. Get your coat. We're leaving. So what are we allowed to get? Well, what do you want? Is that a trick question? Of course not. I wrote a Christmas list. I don't know why you even bother. It's not like we're getting Christmas presents again. Hey, now. What? It's true. We can get Christmas presents. The ones from me don't count. Well, Santa's just been having a hard time trying to find us, that's all. Santa clause isn't- - isn't aware that the fire at St. Jerome's happened yet. I'm sure he heard about it and he'll find you at our house this year. You think so? Yeah. Sure. Abby? Whatever. So what do you wanna get today, buddy? Um, we can get anything, right? Absolutely. So I was thinking maybe I can get a television for my room and then maybe I can get a gaming console and a capture card and maybe- - whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. What's the matter, Jesse? You said we could get anything. Clothes. I meant clothes, shoes, stuff like that. Oh. But you can put that stuff on your Christmas list, okay? Okay. I can't believe I have to go clothes shopping with my little brother and some random guy. First of all, I'm not just some random guy. And second of all, you don't have to go shopping with us. I don't? No. My girlfriend and her sister are coming to. Yay. More people to feel sorry for us. Martha happens to be 14. So I thought you might like to meet a friend. What's the point? I'm not sticking around, am I? Okay, you have two options, Abigail. Either come shopping with David and I or Maggie and Martha. Or, I mean, I can always have my dad pick you up some clothes. Maggie and Martha. Yeah, that's what I thought.

So they're straightening everything up. Who's Josie? The Potters took in a foster kid. Oh, nice. And Jimmy's sister is coming in town to meet Tim. Tim? The foster kids the Capernaums took in. Jimmy and Timmy? Cute. I guess. And what about Maggie? Oh, she's spending some time with Martha. They're going through their new clothes. So it's just you and me tonight. Yep. And the kids, of course. Yep. You know, Jesse, I wanna know why, why do you have such a problem with them staying here? I don't have a problem, okay? It just surprised me to see them. That's all. Yeah, well, listen, why don't you just take the rest of the month off? The rest of the month? Dad, I can't. Sure you can. Who's gonna help you out? It's slow, I don't need any help, and if I do, I'll call you. But dad... no buts, no buts. Listen, Lydia is handling the bookkeeping and the paperwork. You need time off. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. And these kids, they need someone to be here for them. Why don't I work and you stay here with the kids? I'm too old for little kids. Great. Thanks. Hey, are you actually going to bed? Yeah, why not? It's barely 10 o'clock. You never go to bed before 10:00. Something tells me I'm gonna need my sleep. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Abby. Psst! Abby, are you awake? Of course I'm awake. Come on. Can you at least try to be more nice? I am nice. Yeah, but he's like us now. He doesn't have a mom anymore. He's not a foster kid. He has a family. Yeah, but they're letting us be part of it. For now. So what if it's just for now? Let's enjoy it. Fine, but only for you. Thanks. Great! You're up! Can we go play in the snow? Huh? Everybody's going to Tim's house. Can we go? Who's Tim? Tim, my friend from St. Jerome's. He's at Jimmy's house. Can we go? To Jimmy's house? Yeah. All the kids from hope are going. He said he has the best sledding slope ever. Yeah, he does. So can we go? Just let me get some coffee first. And then come we go? Yeah, I guess. Awesome! Come on, Jesse! Yep, I got it. Do you always sleep this late? No, I usually work. So why aren't you working now? Because I'm spending time with you guys. Did your dad make you? What? No. Yeah. Sure. Can we go now? I just woke up. I'm not even dressed, buddy. But all the kids are gonna get there before us. There's gonna be no more snow. As soon as I finish my coffee, we'll go, okay? Can you finish your coffee and get ready at the same time? I prefer not to. It's okay, David. Grownups take a lot longer than us to get ready in the morning. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing. Just you're not young like us. You take longer to get your energy. Go get your coat on. What? Yeah, go get your coat on. I'll be ready in five minutes. I don't know if that's such a good idea. Okay, how old do you think I am? I don't know, 40. 40! No way, Abby. Thank you! At least 45. Go get in the car. Awesome! 45, ha ha ha. Okay. - Ready? - Ready! Okay. Put on your seat belts. Hey, come on! - Hey, Abby. - Hey, Rachel. What took you so long? Someone slept in late. Grownups. Come on, let's go. Something wrong? I just didn't think there were gonna be this many kids. Why not? I don't know. How many kids are at St. Jerome's anyways? I don't know. About 100 I think. 100? Where'd they all go? Different places. People like your dad took them in, at least until St. Jerome's is rebuilt. But 100 of you lived there. Yeah, there's a lot of kids like me out there. Kids like you? What does that mean? Foster kids. I never really thought about it. Most people don't. There's almost half a million kids in the system in the United States. Wow. How do you know all this stuff? The Internet. I wanted to see our chances of getting out. You make it sound like you're in prison. We're not, but we're probably gonna be there until I'm 18. I mean, people only want to adopt babies. That can't be true. Well, the ones who want to adopt older don't want two and I'm not going anywhere without my brother. Let's go. Stop throwing snowballs at me. - Go! - Okay. Oh, you got it? Woo! Jesse, hey! I didn't expect to see you here. Why not? You don't really seem into the whole kids scene, Jess. What? Really? You don't wanna have kids one day? I never said that. He just doesn't like them very much. Maggie, come on. And what is so bad about kids? Nothing. All I said is that there's a lot of them, okay? Okay then. Come sledding. Huh? Sledding. It's a blast. It is, Jesse. Let's play in the snow. I don't know. It's so much fun. It's like we're the kids again. At least come out on one ride with me. Yeah, you don't wanna be called a fuddy-duddy. A fuddy-duddy? You know, the kids this morning thought that I was 45. It is not funny. Okay, old man. Yeah, maybe Mrs. Capernaum can put on some hot tea and face your rocker towards the window while you watch all the fun we're having. All right, let's go. Woo! Let's go. ♪ When I'm down ♪ feeling lost ♪ all hope is gone ♪ I want it back at all costs ♪ I come to you ♪ just like I've done ♪ 1,000 times before ♪ just like 1,000 times to come ♪ ♪ I come to you, lord ♪ you are my light ♪ you save my soul ♪ you'll be my guide ♪ when I come to you ♪ like I've done ♪ 1,000 times before ♪ Days go by ♪ times moves on the kids had fun. Yeah they did. Remember when we used to go sledding down this hill? Must've been the best. Yeah, it was. I bet you were the most popular guy in school, Jimmy. You could say that. At least in the winter he was. Ooh. Man, I just don't know how these kids got all this energy. I'm ready for a nap. Hey, don't let them hear you say that. They're brutal. You're telling me. I had to beg my dad to give me off just so I could prove to Josie I could play in the snow. Please, my dad told me to take off so that I can spend some time with the kids. Well that's really sweet. Think he'll give me off too? No chance. You guys don't want to go to Momo's tonight? I don't know, man. I'm still tired. Yeah, I'm in. I'm not gonna let some kids stop me from having a social life. That's the spirit, Jesse. I could stick around and help you clean up so you can come out tonight. For real? Yeah. It's the least I can do. I'll help out too. Nope, that's okay. We have got it. Why don't you drive Josie home and then Jimmy can take me. Yeah, I can. Uh, sure. Okay. Josie, let's go. Eight o'clock? Works for me. I'll ask my dad to watch the kids. Me too. Oh, don't forget to ask your parents to watch Josie tonight. Lydia, she lives in my old room. We can't even hear her from the apartment. Well maybe aunt may and uncle Z have plans. My parents never go out. See you guys at 8:00. All right. See ya. You two sure you don't need any help? Yeah, we got it. Yeah, we do. See you later, Jesse. See ya. David, Abigail, let's go! Man, I sound like my dad. Come on, get in the car. Maggie. Maggie. - Maggie. - I lost my spork! Go home. Huh? You and your friends been sleeping for the past hour. We closed 45 minutes ago. I'm so sorry, uncle Vic. I've never seen anyone literally fall asleep on their feet. It was an active day with the kids. Wake your friends up and head out. This is a restaurant, not a hotel. I'll close up. See you at home. See you at home. Wakey, wakey! Hey, guys. It's time to go home. Come on, John, Jesse, Lydia, Jimmy, come on. Did I fall asleep? We all did. What time is it? It's a little after 9:00. What? That's all? It feels like it's after midnight. Nope. Uncle Vic just closed the doors and woke me up. Looks like it was a slow night. I'll tell you one thing. I'm not ready for kids. It was a fun day though. Yeah, too much fun. My knee's killing me. Are you working tomorrow morning? Maggie, I work every morning, so. True. Lydia is working too. Yeah, so is Jimmy. Oh, I guess I'm the lucky one. You're not working? Your old man fire you or something? Nope. Forced vacation. Oh. Mr. Mcneil wants Jesse to spend time with the foster kids. You should plan a Christmas party at your house for them. That's a great idea. Oh, I don't know. I'll help you. It'll be fun. For all the kids? Well, I mean the ones in hope, at least. You have plenty of space, Jesse. And I could have my dad donate, you know, desserts from the coffee Potter. That's a good idea. I'll bring food from here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on. You have something else going on, mcneil? Don't look at me. I think it's a great idea. Just do it, Jesse. Is she awake? Fine. I'll talk to my dad. Great. But you're gonna help me. You all are gonna help me. Fine by me. I'm okay with that as long as it's after I get a full night's sleep. Come on, Lydia. Let's go. I'll walk you to your car, Maggie. Thanks. I'll grab my coat. Let's go, we gotta go. Come on, sleeping beauty. Where's Lydia? I'm right here. Oh, sorry. That's okay. We all fell asleep. We did? Yeah. I can tell you all about it tomorrow morning. Breakfast? Okay, sure. What? Don't even think about it. Let's go. I think that's a wonderful idea. I knew you would. When do you wanna do it? I don't know. I mean, Christmas is Saturday. There's not that much time to plan it. Well, there's plenty of time with everybody offering to help. I only talked to John, Jimmy, Maggie, and Lydia. Well, and if they're all going to help, I'm sure other people will too. Yeah, I guess. I'll tell you what. I will find out what other families in hope took in foster kids. We'll invite them too. Invite them where? Abigail, you're up early. I heard voices. What's going on? Well, Jesse is going to host a Christmas party for you here. Really? Yeah. Why not? Well, who's coming? Hey, maybe Abigail wants to help you plan everything. I'll see you two tonight. So... Uh, do you want some breakfast? Um, I'll wait for David to get up, thanks. You guys do everything together, right? Yeah. Sometimes at night he even sleeps in my room. We had to hide it at St. Jerome's. Really? Why? Boys and girls sleep in different areas. Even if you're brother and sister? Yeah. Boys were in one place. Girls in another. Brother's got to sit with brothers, sisters with sisters, but me and David were separated. That's awful. It's not as bad as it sounds. St. Jerome took really good care of us. There was just a lot of rules to follow to maintain structure. Whatever that means. I can't believe you were in the same building and couldn't see each other. Oh no, we could see each other. Meals, free time, weekends. Still, it must be hard. You get used to it. You shouldn't have to. Just four more years, then I can get out and bring him with me. So, about the Christmas party. Oh, you don't have to do that for us. I'm sure it was your dad's idea. Actually it wasn't. It was mine. Really? You want to throw a Christmas party for us? Hey, I used to have some pretty awesome Christmas parties here when I was your age. Wait, really? Don't act so surprised. The 20th of December every year right up until I graduated high school. Well, what happened after high school? Well, I moved away and went to college. What happened when you came back? To be honest, Abigail, I haven't been back long enough to plan a Christmas party since. I came back in January when my mom got sick with cancer. She died in march. Right. I remember. You seem to remember a lot of things. I do. My mom said it was a gift. I think it'll be nice to plan a Christmas party. Maybe we can do some things that our moms would have liked to do. Yeah, I'd like that. All right. So, decorations. One last announcement before heading out for the week, Joe and Jesse mcneil will be hosting a Christmas party for the kids from St. Jerome's this Monday, tomorrow, December 23rd, starting at 6:00 pm. A buffet dinner will be provided by Momo's and desserts will be provided by the coffee Potter. If you would like to attend or even just help out, please reach out to Joe mcneil at north fork autobody. On a personal note, I would like to thank the people of this parish for opening their homes to the kids from St. Jerome's. 27 children are staying in hope for the holidays. Pastor Luke. Yes, Mr. Salem. I'd like to testify if you don't mind. Please do. Now my wife and I were here last week and we heard what you said about the fire at St. Jerome's. Now we've never been able to have kids of our own. I mean, we even tried adopting infants from other countries because we just didn't think it was possible to do that here in the United States. I mean, we got a month away from bringing our baby girl home and it got canceled on us. We had everything already set up. The rooms, everything. We just didn't have the heart to take it apart. So we closed the door. But last week when you were talking about St. Jerome's, we knew we had to rush right on down there and fill out those forms. We did. We were matched up a little Samantha. And, praise the lord, we filled out the official adoption application. God is good! See, there are a lot of new beginnings for the kids at St. Jerome's. Babies always get adopted first. Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Salem. Let's be sure to keep them all in our prayers. Please rise. Be people of love. Let love live in your heart and share the love of Christ with all you meet. Share love by loving those you see regularly. Start by loving your community. Share love by loving those you do not know. How do your actions impact the rest of god's creation? Share love by praying for our world. In this advent season, we need to see, feel, and share love. As you go out into the wonder of god's creations, share love, joy, hope, and peace with all you meet. Amen. Amen. Go forth in peace and have a great week. Jesse, hi. What are you doing here, Lucy? Is that any way to greet me? I thought you were still in Los Angeles. We came home for Christmas. I didn't think you considered hope your home anymore. Well, as long as my parents live here, I do. Aren't you happy to see me? Not really. Lucy, the last time I saw you, you were trying to get me to move to the west coast with you. There's still time. No. No, there isn't. I'm with Maggie now. Oh. I saw you and her with those kids. You guys playing house? Lucy, go home. I don't want you here. So, which one's your mom? I wanna pay my respects. Lucy, come on. What? She loved us when we were together. Yeah, that was a long time ago. And she didn't like you after we broke up. As a matter of fact, she warned me not to ever get back together with you again. Oh. Well looks like I'm here and she's not. So, I guess I won. Goodbye, Lucy. Wait. Aren't you gonna wish me a merry Christmas? Merry Christmas. Now, can you please leave? Sure. Maybe I'll swing by your Christmas party. I'm sorry, but it's only for the families that are fostering kids for St. Jerome's, so. My mom took in a kid. Jesse, don't look so surprised. She's the mayor of hope. Now she has to lead by example and all that jazz. Yeah. I feel sorry for that kid. Don't. He's doing great. Maybe I'll bring him over. See you later. Hey, where have you been? I just needed to blow off some steam. Is everything okay? Hey, Jesse. Where have you been? I was just walking home, buddy. Then I stopped by to see mom at the cemetery. Are you gonna cancel the Christmas party? Of course not. Okay, you just seemed like you didn't wanna have it anymore after church. No. I do. I definitely do. Well that's good. A lot of kids are looking forward to it. Oh yeah? Yeah. Right, papa Joe? Papa Joe? David came up with the name. I told him he could call me that. Yeah. I'll stick with Mr. Mcneil seeming as this isn't a permanent home. Abby, stop being so mean. So is, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. We'll talk later when little ears can't hear us. Okey-dokey. Abbey? Go away. No. What do you want? You really need to start being nice to Jesse and papa Joe. What's the point? And I wish you wouldn't call him papa Joe. Why not? Because he's not our papa. He's not our dad or our grandpa. He's just like everyone else. And he's gonna give us back to St. Jerome's once it's rebuilt. So what? At least we can have a nice Christmas now. David, I'm sick of being a foster kid. I want a home. So do I. But, you're my home, Abby, and you're kind of making it hard to have fun here. I'm sorry. I'll go apologize. Promise? I promise. I'll be right back. I can't believe how many foster kids there are. You're right. I told you, your mom and I, we were gonna take in a foster kid then she got sick and we thought, you know, it's just too much responsibility to take in a child who's already been through so much, you know? Yeah. So is that, that's what's on your mind? Sort of. I'm all ears. I ran into Lucy after church. Lucy Horton? What is she doing back so soon? She was just here in September. That's what I said. She apparently is home for the holidays. Sounds like she's got something up her sleeve. Maybe. Her mom took in a kid from St. Jerome's. No, no way. Yeah. A boy. That poor, poor child. That's what I said. She suggested that they're coming to the Christmas party here. No, no! I really don't want her here, dad. I don't blame you. She's bad news. You know, to be truthful, I don't want her here either. So what should I do? Should I say something to her? I wouldn't. But what about the boy? I know. He deserves to be here. She doesn't. Why should he miss out because she's such a terrible person? And you have given her plenty of chances, son. I know, I know I have. She's gonna ruin everything, dad. I really don't want her around, dad. I feel your pain, but you, you have to do what's right. Which is? I don't know. I wish she would just leave and never come back. So do I, son. So do I. Oh. What happened? I'm leaving, David. Why, Abby? Why are you crying? I overheard Mr. Mcneil and Jesse talking about me. What'd they say? They said how they wished I wasn't around and you belong here. I mean, at least you have a chance for a family. But you're my family, Abby. No one wants me. Don't you get it? Of course you don't. I always told you to be nice. Yeah, well it's too late now. I'm leaving. What do you mean? Tonight after everyone goes to sleep, I'm leaving. I'm running away. And I'll come back when I'm 18 for you. No way! I'm coming with you. You can't. You're too little. I'm 10. I'm not little. Well, you're too little for me to take care of and you can't take care of yourself. Neither can you. Yes, I can. If you don't bring me with you, I'm telling. You better not. I will. Fine. I'll come get you after they go to sleep. No, I'm sleeping in your bed. You don't trust me to wake you up? No, actually. You're not leaving me here. I need you, Abby. I can't stop thinking about what these kids are gonna go back to. What do you mean? I just had more privileges growing up. I took a lot for granted. Hey, we were lucky to even have a family. Exactly. Dad, what would you think about fostering them? Abigail and David? Yeah. I mean, I know it would be a full-time job, but it's not like we can't handle it. I mean, they're old enough, you know? Are you sure? Yeah, I think so. Son, you can't think so about something like this, son. I mean, we would be changing their lives. There are no take backs. Once we agree to foster them, they are either leaving because they want to, or because they found a permanent family. But what about us? What about us what? Why can't we be their permanent family? Mr. Salem down at the church, they just put in an adoption application for the baby they're fostering. I don't know. I think there are a lot of steps and I think we should talk to the kids first. Yeah, I guess. You know, this might be a good conversation for Christmas morning. - Hey buddy. - Hey. Where's Abigail? She's in her room. She doesn't feel well. Oh, no. Should I go check on her? No, she said she wanted to take a nap. Oh, okay. Well here, let me help you finish these cards. Oh, no thanks. This is actually gonna be my last one. Oh, you know, tomorrow I'm gonna take all of these to Ms. Tubbins on my way to work. Thanks, Mr. Mcneil. Mr. Mcneil? What happened to papa Joe? Can I go to my room now? You don't have to ask me that. Hey, are you feeling all right? Thanks. That was weird. Yeah, I wonder what's going on. No idea. David, David, wake up. Shh. It's time to go. Are you sure? Yeah, there's probably a farm or barn we can stay in until they stop looking for us. Okay. If you say so. I do. Let's go. Abby, I'm scared. Don't be. But I am. It's not easy to turn off being scared. I know. Everything's gonna be okay. Promise? I promise. Hey, there's a farm up the road. They have a barn with horses. Horses? Really? Yeah. I'm sure we can stay there tonight and be warm. How far away is it? I don't know. We passed it on the way to church. I saw the horses in the fields. I know what you're talking about. Can I pet the horses? Sure. As long as you don't make any noise. I won't. Thanks for coming over early to help out. No problem. Martha will be over after school. Are David and Abigail in school yet? No, not yet. They're giving the foster kids a break until January 3rd. Dad actually goes next week to register them. Can't you do it? No, I'm not their official guardian. Ah. Then where are they? Upstairs sleeping. They weren't feeling too well last night. Oh no. I hope they're not sick for the party. They'll be fine. I'll go check on them. Okay, they're upstairs in Abigail's room. David wanted to sleep with her last night. Aww, poor kid. Still dealing with anxiety from the fire I bet. Oh, I'm sure. Be right back. Oh, hey Maggie? Yeah? What would you say if I asked my dad to foster the kids on a permanent basis? I'd say I told you so. Abigail? Abigail, David? Are you okay? They're still sleeping. Let them go a little bit longer. I'm sure they're gonna have a late night and they won't wanna crash. Good idea. Maybe they'll sleep it off. I hope so. Good morning, miss Shiloh. Pretty cold night last night. How do you like those heaters? It's a lot warmer in here than it is in my own garage. David, shh. Someone's in here. Hey, Mr. Jericho. Look like we're gonna get some more snow today. So you guys better stay inside. I'll open the pens for you. But don't you go too far. I don't wanna pull you back out of those snowdrifts. That was a close one. Yeah, did you hear him though? He said it's gonna snow the rest of the day. Yeah, well we better stay here until the weather gets better. Yeah. I have to go to the bathroom. There's a bathroom outside. Didn't you see it? No. We saw a bathroom and an office when we came in. I guess I was too tired. Okay, well go now before he gets back. Hey, John. Didn't expect to see you so early. Yeah, the old man insisted I come over and help you set everything up. Well that's great because Maggie and I could really use your help, man. Looks like it. You know, you got like 70 people coming here, right? That many? Yeah, that many. This party's the talk of the town, all right? You know, all the foster families are coming. They even hung up flyers at the coffee Potter. I guess I didn't realize that many people were coming. I better go wake up the kids so they can help us out. They're still sleeping? Oh yeah, yeah. But I bet they didn't even sleep. I mean, I remember how I was at that age. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, that's because you could sleep through a parade marching through your bedroom. Okay, so what? In my case, that's a good talent to have. I'm gonna go wake the kids up. Maggie's in the kitchen. All right. David and Abigail. You guys awake? Can I come in, guys? Abigail, I'm coming in. David, Abigail. It's getting late. Time to get up. Come on guys, lets- Oh no. Maggie! North fork autobody. This is Lydia. How can I help you? Lydia? It's Jesse. Jesse. What's wrong? The kids are missing. What? Which kids? Abigail and David. Do you know where my dad is? He's with a customer. Let me go get him. There's no time. Russ and Maggie are out looking for them and John's on the phone with the police. Can you just tell my dad to come home and wait here in case they come back? Okay and where are you going? Out to find them too. I'm on my way. Thanks. There's nothing that cops can do unless they've only been gone for 24 hours, man. But they're kids I know, I know. Can you stay here until my dad and Lydia come back? Yeah. Why, where are you going? I'm going to find David and Abigail. ♪ If you teach a bird to sing ♪ she gonna learn to fly ♪ if you let her sing ♪ she gonna fly ♪ if you let her sing ♪ she gonna fly away ♪ if you teach a bird to sing ♪ she gonna learn to fly ♪ if you let her sing ♪ she gonna fly ♪ if you let her sing ♪ she gonna fly away ♪ You think you've got it ♪ cage of brass and a lock and key ♪ ♪ You think she's too dumb to set herself free ♪ ♪ But the fact that you're locking her up ♪ ♪ Shows you're the dummy ♪ you think you're all of that ♪ and a bag full of chips ♪ but you've gotta control ♪ just to get your kicks ♪ and the fact that you like it like that ♪ ♪ Shows you're I really appreciate you letting me look in your barn, Mr. Lenord. Oh no problem, Jesse. I was in here a few times today. I didn't see anybody. Then again, I wasn't looking. Abigail, David! Take your time, son. Look around as much as you need. I'm going up and finish my dinner and help the misses with the dishes. Just let me know when you leave. Thank you Mr. Lenord. You kids in here? We've been looking for you all day long. Come on, guys. I'm not mad. No one is. We're all just really worried about you. I don't even know why you guys would run away. Papa Joe and I really liked having you guys at our house. Why don't you just come out and we can go home? Please. Come on, kids. Dear lord, please help me find Abigail and David. You know, I never really had the desire to have children but these kids are different. They brought something out in me that I never thought was there. I didn't think I could care for kids the way that I care for them and I've only just spent a week with them. Please, please, help me find them. Dad and I want them to live with us for good. I've never had a brother or a sister and now I get to have both. I know it's a little late, but still, we can create memories. We can be a family. Do you really mean it? David? David, no. Do you really mean it? I mean, having a family? Every word. Don't listen to him, David. He's lying. I'm not lying, I promise. Don't make promises you can't keep. Abby, stop. No, I heard you talking about me. About how I ruin everything. Abigail, I never said that. Yes, you did. I overheard you talking with your dad saying you wish I would just leave and never come back. Abigail, that wasn't about you. Oh, it wasn't? No, it wasn't. Then who was it about? My ex-girlfriend. She's not the nicest person and she just came back into town. Well then who was the little boy if it wasn't David? Her mother, who's even worse than she is, took in a boy from St. Jerome's. I knew it. I knew you didn't give up on us. Give up on you? No way! The opposite actually. What do you mean? Well, dad and I wanted to wait until Christmas to tell you, but I think you already overheard me talking to god. Is it true? Yeah, it's true. So say it. What? I want you to say it, what you're gonna do on Christmas. Dad and I want you two to stay with us for as long as you want. Really? Really. Abby, what's wrong? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. And you're not just saying it? No, Abigail. I mean it. Thank you. Can we go home now? Yeah. Let's go home. Abigail, are you coming? Yeah. Oh, and you can call me Abby. Abby it is. All right, guys.
