[Happy music!] [Docent] Attention, tourists! When we arrive in Tokyo, there'll be a five-minute rest stop. You MUST be back on the bus in exactly five minutes so that we can maintain our exciting schedule! This morning, we wil visit one temple, one shrine and one house. After a 20-minute box lunch, we will take the harbor tour by boat, then the city tour by bus, and we will end the afternoon at 1700 with a genuine Japanese tea ceremony. Synchronize your watches; it is 0813... MARK! Five minutes! FIVE MINUTES! We cannot wait for latecomers! [Big Bird] Um, um, excuse me? [Docent] Mmhm? [Big Bird] But is this whole tour going to be, um... this organized? [Docent] Impressive, isn't it? In one day, we will see everything there is to see in Tokyo, then one day at Mount Fuji, one day in Nagoya, One day in Kyoto, to see EVERYTHING there is to see there, and we fly home on the 15th. [Big Bird] But aren't we gonna meet any-- Japanese people? [Docent] Of course! The hotels have several Japanese employees who speak English very well! [Big Bird] But how about just... people people? [Docent] Can you speak Japanese? [Big Bird] Well, no... [Docent] (off Barkley) Can he? [Big Bird] Heh, no, he can't speak anything except maybe a little dog. [Barkley] WOOF! [Docent] Then, how do you propose to speak to any Japanese? [Big Bird] They don't speak American? [Docent] Usually not... [Barkley whining, barking] [Big Bird] Well... Come on, Barkley! This IS Tokyo... [exasperated] And we only got FIVE MINUTES! [Barkley] WOOF WOOF WOOF! [Docent] FOUR minutes! [STING!] [Big Bird] Of particular interest in Japan are the charming little houses delicately constructed of paper and wood! PAPER AND WOOD?! [Barkley barks] So much for THAT guidebook. You know, Barkley, there's something about the people here. They all look different somehow. I've got it! They all have black hair! [Salarymen speaking Japanese] Hai! Hai! Hai! [Big Bird] Hi! Hi! Hi! Heh. [Salaryman] Ohayo. [Big Bird] Ohio?! [Salaryman] Hai. [Big Bird] Funny, you don't sound like you're from Ohio. [Salaryman] Ohayo, hai. [Big Bird] Hi! Huh! Well, there were certainly a couple of nice guys from back home. Hi! [Salaryman] OH! Ohayo! [Big Bird] You too, Ohio?! [Salaryman] Ha, hai hai! Ohayo! [Big Bird] Well, hi, Ohio! [Salaryman] Hai. OHAYO! [Big Bird] Well, there certainly seems to be an unusual number of people here... from Ohio! [Barkley] [I don't know... Maybe that's not what they mean... Oh well.] [Young man] Ohayo. [Big Bird] Ohio?! [Young woman] Ohayo! Hai! [Big Bird] [wearily] Hi... [Young woman admires Barkley in Japanese!] [Young man says it's time to go...] [Big Bird] Uh, Barkey... I'd like to explain to you what's going on here... But I have absolutely NO idea! [Difficult/humorous situation music!] This is some place, huh, Barkley? It sure looks a lot like New York City, except here, there's more people from Ohio. Boy, oh boy oh boy! Wait till we tell the gang on the bus. *remembers with horror* THE BUS?! [Adventurous music!] NO! STOP! Come back! Oh, come ba-- Oh, I can't believe it! Look, they went off and left us! Now what are we gonna do?! We can't speak Japanese; we don't know anybody here! I don't have hardly any money! Do you have any money? Ah, of course not; you're a DOG! Oh no... and they've got our plane tickets and everything! [Barkley whimpers...] [Big Bird] Oh, well, don't be scared, Barkley. Oh, it's, uh, ah, we'll be okay. I mean, I've got a little money, and some bird seed and a doggie biscuit! [Barkley ruffs, a little heartened!] [Cheering music!] [Big Bird] I don't know about you, old buddy, but I'm starving! Shall we spend a little of our money on a bite to eat? Oh, look! Um, that looks like fish... and that's some kind of meat. So we'll get the meat for you, because you're a doggie, and I'll get the fish, because whenever I visit my cousin Bernie the seagull, we have fish and it is DELICIOUS! Whoa! Oh, uh, hm. Uh, hello, uh, we'll-- we'll take, uh-- that one, and that one. Uhhh-- um, well, that one and that one. THAT ONE, and THAT ONE! [Waiter sighs in resignation; perhaps this American bird person is slow or childlike, or that language barrier is an issue; whatever the case, he's unable to correct this American bird person.] [Big Bird, proudly] Come, Barkley! [Light Japanese restaurant muzak] [Big Bird] Oh. [Big Bird] Well, uh, that one's for me, and, uh, that one's for him. [Barkley growls excitedly!] [Big Bird, condescendingly] This one here, and that one there. [Big Bird] All right, and here's the money. Thank you! [Waiter] Thank you very much, sir. [Big Bird] Hey... Some restaurant! Heh. They didn't even give us any silverware. What do they expect us to eat with, these little sticks?! Heh heh. Well, might as well dig in. [CRUNCH!] OOOH! [Barkley sniffs, and ultimately rejects his "food".] [Big Bird taps his "fish" on his plate] Boy! Talk about stale! [Barkley verifies: his is inedible, too!] [Big Bird] Oh... [Big Bird] Oh! [Big Bird] Hah! [Big Bird] Oh, that's what they're for. Now I'll try. Ah, well-- okay! Haha! Uh, thank you. [Big Bird sniffs:] Hey... that-that was fake food in the window! Boy, what a dope I've been!!! [Barkley makes excited sounds as he waits for his food, and it's set down.] [Barkley dives in like a real dog! Big Bird eats silently.] [Big Bird] Ahhh! Thank you! That was delic-- uh-- Oh! Oh no no no! [Waiter declines, saying the meal is on the house.] Oh, thank you! [Waiter] Thank you very much. [Big Bird] What a swell guy! Sigh. [Man] Ah. Konnichiwa! [Big Bird] Uhhh... don't tell me. Ohio, right? [Man] Ah. Ohayo. Hai! [Big Bird] Eh. Hi. How did I know... Uh, let's see if we can figure out where we are. Ummm... Well... That first one there looks like it might be a little birdcage with a perch on top, and the one under that might be a breadbox. Oh, but that doesn't make any sense! Oh, what a mess I've gotten us into! [Music starts...] At least on Sesame Street, I knew the alphabet! Oh, I'll never see Snuffy again! Or Maria, or Grover, or anybody back home. Barkley...

[Big Bird] Well... oh boy... What was it the guide told us when we got off the bus? Hmm... Think, Big Bird! Use your bird brain!

[YW] Now, there are some things which you need to know. [BB] For what? [YW] To visit a Japanese home. [BB] Oh. [YW] Before one enters a Japanese home, one must take off one's shoes. [BB] Check, we take OFF our shoes. You got that, Barkley? [BARK!] [YW] And when one meets the host, it is customary to kneel down. [BB] Check, KNEEL DOWN. [YW] It is a form of bowing to show respect. And the deeper one bows, the more respect one shows. Want to try it? [BB] Sure! [YW] Okay. I bow to you to show you that I honor you. [Three-tone koto] [BB] And I bow back to you like this. [Lower three-tone koto] [She giggles slightly] Come on, Barkley, let's see a bow. Bow! [YW and BB laugh] [YW] Very nice! [BB] Good job. [YW] And if I want to show great respect for you, I bow to you even more deeply. [Five-tone koto] [BB] Oh! Well, here's how Barkley and I feel about you! [Fast nine-tone koto] [YW giggles] Thank you, Big Bird! I am honored. Are you okay? [BB] Hey, you know what? [YW] What? [BB] I don't have any shoes to take off! [YW giggles] Don't worry! If you don't have shoes, how can anyone expect you to take them off? [BB] Can I ask you something? [YW] Of course. [BB] How come you're going to so much trouble for us? [YW] It seems to me you needed a friend. Wouldn't you be my friend, if I were homesick in America? [BB] Sure. [YW] Good... [Wistfully] Because the time is near, when I am going to need a friend... [Dramatic music...] [YW] One more thing: there are many people that I must visit and say goodbye to, and I do not have much time, so I cannot stay here with you. But my friends are expecting you. [BB] But-- but-- but-- [YW] I can meet you here tomorrow morning, and we can drive on to Hakone. [BB] But... [They greet each other] [BB] Uh. What did she-- where's my friend?! Uh-um-uh... I...

Ohayo!] You know, I think all of you are just swell, and you've been really good to me and Barkley, but if one of you is from Ohio, you can knock me over with a pinfeather! [Big Bird starts!] [YW] They are not from Ohio, Big Bird. 'Ohayo' is Japanese for "Good morning," and 'Hai' is Japanese for "Yes." So when someone says "Ohayo" to you, he's saying "Good morning." And when you say "Hai" to a Japanese, he thinks you are saying "yes." [BB] Thank goodness! I was beginning to think there was no one left in Cleveland.

[Note well, first use of 'Kaguya-hime'!] [Whimsical music starts] [Narrator] Once upon a time in old Japan, near the city of Kyoto, there was a forest of pretty green bamboo trees. In this forest lived an old man whose job it was to find the best bamboo trees and cut them for market. One night, when he was at work in the forest-- as it happened, it was the night of a full moon-- he saw something very strange, a bamboo stump with a golden light glowing inside of it. He called for his wife to come and see, and when they looked inside the stump to see where the light was coming from, they discovered a tiny, beautiful girl! The old woodsman and his wife were delighted! They took the beautiful child home with them to raise as their own daughter. The entire village came out to celebrate the arrival of the little Bamboo Princess. The parents named her "Kaguya-hime," which means 'the shining princess of the bamboo.' And just as the bamboo grows from a tiny sprout to a tall tree in only a few months, so Kaguya-hime grew in just a few months into a beautiful woman! Word of the lovely Bamboo Princess spread very quickly throughout the land. And rich and powerful men came from all over Japan to seek her hand in marriage. One said, "Marry me, Kaguya-hime! I am the richest man in Japan." Another said, "No, no; marry me! I am the bravest warrior in Japan." The third said, "Pay no attention to these two! Marry ME, Kaguya-hime!" Still more handsome and famous men came to court the beautiful Bamboo Princess. But Kaguya-hime spoke to them very sadly. "I cannot marry you, as I cannot marry any man on this Earth! "I am a princess from the Palace of the Moon, and I was placed here on Earth for only a short time. "On the night of the next full moon, at exactly midnight, a mission is coming from the moon to take me back. "I have grown so fond of my dear Mother and Father, and of all the people and places of Japan... "that it breaks my poor heart to have to say Farewell to them." Kaguya-hime's Mother wept bitterly at the thought of losing her beloved daughter and asked... "When is the next full moon?" And Kaguya-hime answered with terrible sadness... "On the 15th of the month. Tonight." And almost as she spoke, the procession from the moon appeared to escort the tearful Princess back-- --to the Palace of the Moon. But her old Mother and Father always believed that one day, another golden light would appear in a bamboo stump... in the forest, to signal that Kaguya-hime had come back to them on Earth... And who knows? Perhaps one day Kaguya-hime will return. [Applause] [BB] Oh no! We've only got 20 minutes! Oh, come on, Barkley! We're gonna miss our train! Oh boy, am I lucky they got an American clock here! [BB] Wait-- Wait! Here we are! Here we are! [pants] Oh, I'm sorry we're late! We got swept into a school and we saw a play about-- [YW] It's all right! Come on! [BB] Oh-- okay. Let's get on the [train]... [Shinkansen ROARS past!] [BB] I'm sorry we were late again, but we were watching this play about a Bamboo Princess. [YW, very measured] That's all right, but today is the 15th, so if we are going to find your tour, and if you are going to go back to America tonight-- [BB] I know, I know-- We'll never get lost again! Ever, ever, ever! [YW] I have so much to do before midnight. Now, wait here this time, okay? Don't even think of wandering off again. [BB] Oh, you can count on us! I am one reliable bird! Now, you hear that, Barkley? [Barkley moans] Don't you move! You stay! [STING!] Wh-where did she go?! [Barkley makes confused sounds, but--] [BB] Oh! [BB] Gee... Did you see that, Barkley?! Come on!!! [Whimsical music] [BB] Wooooooooow! [reading] The Sanjusangendo Temple. Boy, what a mouthful. "In this beautiful temple are 1000 golden images of Kannon Bodhisattva. To see that no harm comes to the 1000 images, "and to frighten away intruders, there are also in the temple a number of ferocious gods and goddesses standing guard." [Scary bombastic music] [Barkley, finding himself alone in the temple, is deeply frightened by these images!] [Fast-paced music, Barkley ripping around the corner yelping back towards and PAST Big Bird in an undercranked style!] [BB] BARKLEY! [4x] It's me, Big Bird! Barkley...! [BB, tiredly] Barkley... *pants* Oh, uh-- I'm sorry. [YW] It's all right. [We gradually become aware of loud frogs, toads, crickets...] [BB sighs] I promised to stay where you left us, and I didn't, and then I lost Barkley. Now, even if we find the tour at the airport, I can't go home without him. [YW] Of course not. [BB] You know something funny? [YW] What's that? [BB] I still don't know your name. [Mystical music] [YW inhales] Kaguya-hime. [BB] Oh-- oh, that's a beautiful name... Seems like I've heard it somewhere before. It's a full moon tonight... [Kaguya-hime] Yes. This is called the moon viewing place. [Kaguya-hime claps three times] The fish gather when you do that. Do you have anything to feed them? [BB] There's some birdseed in there. They can have that. [Kaguya-hime] There's a biscuit in here. May I give this to them? [BB] I'd feel funny giving that away. It was-- Barkley's... [Kaguya-hime] Of course. Come! [BB] OH! BARKLEY! OH, YOU FOUND HIM! Oh, Barkley! [Kaguya-hime, distracted and sad] Yes. And, I found your tour at the airport. ... This time... they know to wait for you. [Sedate music] [BB sits back down and sighs] I don't want to leave yet! [Kaguya-hime] I know... [BB] I want to know everyone better. You, your friends, and the children... There's so much to see and so many different things to understand, and... now I have to leave, just when I'm beginning to catch on! [Kaguya-hime] You can come back to Japan another time. [BB] Are you coming to the airport? [Kaguya-hime] No... [BB] ... Will you ever come to America? [Kaguya-hime] I don't think so. [BB] Will we ever see you again? [Kaguya-hime] ... Perhaps. [BB] I feel terrible! I'm homesick for Japan, and I haven't even left yet! [Kaguya-hime] This is a night we both have to say goodbye. Try to be strong. Do you know what the Japanese say about bamboo? [BB] No... [Kaguya-hime] They say it is thin but it can withstand the strongest wind. Remember the bamboo tonight. It can make you strong. [BB] Oh, but-- ah, you keep it. It'll make you strong too! [Kaguya-hime] Arigato, Big Bird. Barkley? [Barkley whines] [Kaguya-hime] Sayonara... [Audible nimbus of light] [BB] Kaguya-hime? Barkley, she's gone again. [Barkley whines] [Slow, melancholic music; Homesick reprise] ♫ Pretty paper houses Funny, twisted trees ♪ ♪ All the little children Speaking Japanese ♪ ♪ And a mountain shining Through the sun and the rain ♪ ♪ Make me homesick, Homesick, homesick... ♪ ♪ I've gotta go home, But I will come back again. ♫ Sayonara, Japan. Hey, wait a minute! KAGUYA-HIME?! I knew I heard that name before! Come on, Barkley! SHE NEEDS US NOW! [Barkley barks gamely] [Mystical music, piercing moonlight causing noise] [Ominous music as the entourage step forward...] [Flute rising, as the freshly-cloaked Kaguya-hime discards BB's bamboo stick, and she and the rest of the scene turn black and white] [Twinkling fantasy music as she and the entourage turn and walk back through the bamboo...] [BB] KAGUYA-HIME! KAGUYA-HIME! KAGUYA-HIME! ... hmm. [Barkley barks] Hi, Barkley, what you got-- wha-- oh. Hmm. Well, this looks like our stick, but... Hey, we're in the middle of a bamboo forest! [Sigh] Come on, Barkley. I was wrong, and that plane won't wait forever! [Barkley remembers the stick, though, and grabs it before leaving] [Triumphant music!] [BB] Arigato! Heh. [BB sighs] Didn't we have some time, Barkley? We met so many nice people. And we learned some Japanese words! You know, I bet we did more and saw more and learned more than if we'd never got lost at all! [Barkley moans a bit] [BB] And how about that Kaguya-hime? [Barkley whines] [BB] You know what? I actually thought, for a minute there, that SHE was the Bamboo Princess! [Mystical music] It was because she had the same name. She kept appearing and disappearing all the time. And the moon seemed to make her so sad. Stuff like that. [BB] But you and I know that in REAL life, Bamboo Princesses don't hang around helping lost birds and dogs! [Barkley headtilts and whines] [Flourish and end] THE END!
