(bell dings) (peaceful music) (electrical buzzing) (suspenseful music) (wind howling) (suspenseful music) (electrical buzzing) - [P'Torr Voiceover] So many worlds. So many dimensions, all teeming with life. I move through the dimensions, God-like but still a man. A man gifted with great power. I am the creator. I am P'Torr. I traveled across the universe, an exile fleeing my old world. I discovered Yamasong and planned to live there quietly, there with my mechanical companions, my creations. We had peace until my Hollow Children turned on the natives of Yamasong. (screaming) Turned them into horrible machines. Like the Gods of old I poured my anger upon my Hollows. Crushing their plans and placing them in a prison above the world they tried to conquer. (machinery clicking) But one day there was an escape. She had been created from pieces of other Hollows on the Prison Moon. But she was an innocent. Unburdened by the corruption of her builder, Yari. (machinery clicking) (portal whooshing) Because of this, she bypassed the barriers I created and fell to the planet below. (machinery clicking) (water splashing) By chance she met a native of Yamasong. A Terrapin warrior who became her guide and companion. They traveled the wondrous world together for a short time. (statue whooshing) (suspenseful music) Now they are separated but their bond is not severed. (suspenseful hymnal music) A new kind of being, part living, part mechanical. When she returned to the Prison Moon she discovered that her incredible journey had changed her. Now, in her mechanical chest was beating a patchwork heart, and she saw with new eyes. The eyes of her Terrapin friend. Such strange miracles, where will they take us? (suspenseful music) (machinery clicking) The Prison Moon. An instrument of punishment, an act of rage and guilt built to house my mechanical creations. Their sentence for trying to conquer the world, forever teased with a view of Yamasong. Always out of reach. (melancholy music) (footsteps clicking) - Your mother Yari wishes to speak to you. (chain clinking) (machinery whirring) (suspenseful music) (machinery clanging) - So my child, my precious daughter, you have secrets now? - Who could keep a secret from you mother dear? - You did well my child. You found your way to the world below. Perhaps one day you will help us return with you. - I don't rightly know what happened to me, or how. - Well, no matter. Go rest darling. Perhaps one day. (eerie suspenseful music) - [P'Torr Voiceover] Murky darkness, here they hide. The Tricksters. (ghostly whispers) An ancient enemy of Yamasong sending soot storms. Thousands of formless, angry souls to ravage the beautiful world. (laughing) (ghostly whispers) The storms seek to feast on flesh, on the creatures of the planet below. (peaceful music) (groaning) (laughing) - Hey wait up. Got you. (ghostly whispering) Hmm? (ghostly whispering) (suspenseful music) - Stop! - Huh? (whimpering) (screaming) (fire crackling) - Go inside everyone. Close the doors, close the windows, hurry. (suspenseful music) (groaning) Hurry, the storm is here. Shoujun! Shoujun! (groaning) (peaceful music) - Oh these mountains, so cold. I'm so far from the warm shores of home. (shivering) (machinery clicking) Try to stay warm little friend. (exhaling) Hello! Which way back to the warm comforting sea? Ah, my thanks. (exhaling) (peaceful music) - Unbelievable. These Terrapin are getting bold. What is this one doing on our lands? (moaning) Hey Geta, are you going to listen to me? Or do I have to rip your play friend to pieces? (laughs) - Calm down brother Brujt. You can't let small things get to you. If you can't keep your temper now, what will you do is something bad happens? - Maybe it already has, see that Terrapin? - Ah, maybe he's just lost. (groaning) (dramatic music) - Ho, ho, ho! (groaning) (bones crunching) - Be careful big brother. Your relatives are harder to hide from than intruders. Think about who's more dangerous. - Enough horseplay Geta. Let's see what the Terrapin is up to. Perhaps we've found a sacrifice. (suspenseful music) (machinery clicking) - Hey, nothing to worry about girl. We'll be back in familiar land before long. (wind howling) (machinery clicking) (groaning) (groans) - You're trespassing friend. (groaning) (dramatic music) (dagger scraping) (screams) (groaning) (dramatic music) (groaning) (sputtering) (groans) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) (groans) (thudding) (groans) (dramatic music) (screams) (rock cracking) (screams) (wind howls) - [P'Torr Voiceover] The great gyroscope, the heart of the Prison Moon. Nani comes here to listen to the rhythm of vast machine, to draw comfort from its lulling motion. - I wish I could float in the ocean and watch from afar. Rocked by it's rhythms. Yet there's no water on this moon. - [P'Torr Voiceover] Now that her mechanical body has its own heart, she feels a kinship with the machine. The other Hollows are not allowed in this room by my design, but Nani was never part of my plan. (machinery clicking) A patchwork heart. (suspenseful music) The gyroscopic mechanisms of the Prison Moon were never meant to contain a beating heart. (electrical buzzing) (glass shattering) - What's going on? (machinery whistling) (suspenseful music) - The time is near that we return to rule the world below. Through the actions of our dear sister Nani, the ships orbit has been disrupted and we fly to Yamasong. Our triumphant return is at hand. Nani may be too young to remember, but the rest of you, the rest of you remember our glory, our rule, or should I say our service to the world below. We will walk free again and we will make everything right again. Are you with me sisters? (cheering) Nani, there is such potential in you. (machinery rattling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - [Brujt And Greta] All praise Hollow Goddesses, all praise Hollow Goddesses. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (singing in foreign language) (metal cracking) (screaming) (metal clanging) - No, no my precious child. I can't lose you! (machinery clicking) (singing in foreign language) - Please, you're making a mistake. Your Goddesses don't need a sacrifice. - Be silent Terrapin. - Why such hate? Our people haven't warred in years, there's been peace ever since the Hollows were locked in the moon. Can't you, can't you see that you don't need them. - But we do need them. On this day, we will let the Goddesses decide your fate. They will free you from the constraints of your body, see into your very heart. A gift they bring to all beings. Tonight when moonlight descends upon this temple, that gift shall be received. (suspenseful music) (rocks thudding) Bless you Goddesses. A unmistakable sign they are returning to claim what is theirs. - This is no way for a warrior to die. Helpless like a child. (groaning) (sword clangs) (suspenseful music) (singing in foreign language) - Come join me my sisters, return to your service my brave Ovis warriors, there is much to be done. (suspenseful music) Look how obedient you are, how eager to serve. You will make a fine captain for my army. - Run away. The stories about the Hollows, the new bodies they give every living creature, do you know what they did with those mangled by their body factory? Do you know those places you are forbidden to go? Come with me and you'll see. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Hush. There, there child. - [Elder Pyreez] Elder Masook, I came as soon as I received word. - Elder Pyreez, welcome. - News of the moons disappearance from the sky can only mean one thing. If the Hollows escaped from their prison, I fear they will return to their old ways. - These are troubling times indeed. (suspenseful music) (panting) (screams) - Easy, just get me to the water and everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. (wings fluttering) (groaning) They're not after us, yet. (suspenseful music) They must have been summoned by the Hollow Queen. Great danger is upon us, I must get to my village quickly. (suspenseful music) (metal clanging) (machinery clicking) (groaning) (electrical buzzing) (screaming) (electrical buzzing) (panting) (peaceful music) (groaning) Brothers, I'm finally back and I have such troubling news. Gather everyone. - Stop traitor. - Traitor? I've come to save our people. - Your eyes. We'll let the elders decide. (suspenseful music) - Dream the Hidden Forest. Place yourselves along the lantern path. A great many secrets wait for you in the quiet inner world. - Master. - Hmm? - Apologies for the intrusion. Shojun has returned, but his eyes. You must come and see. (Terrapin's chattering) - It pains me Shojun, but I have no choice. The news of the Hollows escape has reached us and the fact that you were there to witness it, I cannot help but conclude that you have been consorting with our old enemy. Your own words condemn you. - But father, I've done no wrong. Is bearing witness a crime? I was taken prisoner by their servant, the Ovis. Don't you believe me? - Enough lies. Look at your eyes. They tell us that you are more Hollow than Terrapin now. What terrible bargain have you struck? - You have violated one of our oldest laws. You have aided the criminal Hollows. Shojun, we strip you of your rank as a clan member. Your staff will be broken, as you have broken our laws and your adopted fathers heart. You'll be sent away, live as an exile. (wood snapping) (melancholy music) (machinery clicking) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) - Little one, find us a place where they can't follow. Like when we played hide and seek remember. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (singing in foreign language) (electrical buzzing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (panting) (suspenseful music) - [Shojun Voiceover] Do you know what they did with those mangled by their body factory? Do you know those places you are forbidden to go? (panting) (suspenseful music) I've lost my clan, they no longer believe in me. What am I to do? My life, this life, everything was for my people. But now I have nothing. (melancholy music) (water splashing) The Hollows have returned and they threaten our world again. I must do something, even without my clans help. They might not know it now, but they do need me. It would be childish to sulk and complain when there is such great danger in the world. - Patchwork girl? (melancholy music) - I have dreamed of this ocean. To look at it with these eyes and to see you again Shojun. - It's so good to find you too Nani. Though, much has changed in a short time. Now, I'm an exile from my clan. It's because of your people that I've been cast out of my village. I want you out of me. I don't want these feelings, these memories, these eyes. I want to be what I was before. - I didn't want this fluttering, pulsing thing in my chest. I didn't try to use it to crash the moon. Things happen, but who can say why? One thing I know, it doesn't do us any good to be angry at each other. (melancholy music) (heartbeat thudding) Do you feel it? Beating there, where there should be a void. A Hollow with a heart, it makes no sense. (heartbeat thudding) - The world is changing. The sun sets and I hope in the morning it will still be here to greet us. The night sky is lonely now, no moon to swim in its starry river. It's death brought your rebirth, but it will never again be in the heavens. Your sisters have done so much harm when they were last here. I only know the stories, but I hope we survive their return. - I also am too young to remember, but I cannot abandon you. The one whose soul is tangled with mine. (machinery clicking) (screeching) (suspenseful music) (sniffing) Sleep. My eyes grow weary. They tire like something living. (suspenseful music) (screams) (groans) (groans) - If you want your Terrapin ally to live Hollow, you better tell me what your people are planning. - Mechanical bodies, like ours, are the greatest gift we can bestow. We will bless the world, like our creator P'Torr has blessed us long ago. - That's the story I grew up with too. If I release you, you must promise not to fight me. - I would not have harmed you then, and I wouldn't now, after you saved my life back at the temple. - I found the body factory, but also something much more terrible. Not all creatures put through the conversion come out right. There's a, there's a place these mangled unfortunates are discarded like pieces of misshapen trash. - I can't believe this. Yari told us that the conversions are painless and there are no mistakes. - [Shojun And Geta] There are always mistakes. - Come and see with your own eyes then. - This is too terrible for words. Did my mother, did my sisters do this? - You must help us stop the Hollows. - But without our creator P'Torr, I fear that Yari is too powerful. - Especially now that she has my people back in her thrall. Her army is growing bigger by the day. She's taking the best warriors and... - Your brother? - There has to be a way. There has to be a way, the old stories tell that P'Torr had a helper. Perhaps if we find him, he'd know about the Hollows, and of their weaknesses. - Yes, Lord Geer was his servant who he spared when he went to face the Hollows. Funny, P'Torr destroyed himself but he couldn't bare to do the same to his creations. He put us on the Prison Moon. Lord Geer was given a safe haven. It's an island, I used to see it when my moon passed over the ocean. - The island with the strange high tower? I saw it afar on many fishing trips, I could sail us there. (peaceful music) (humming) - Hmm. Hmm. Lovely. Hmm, I wonder who decided they needed to see the old fool clockwork? I hope it's not Yari. I know the moon is no longer in the sky, so the nasty creature has most likely escaped her prison. (machinery clicking) Could it be master? (door clanging) No, not possible. She would have forgotten all about it by now, wouldn't she master? - Yes Geer. Help them. - I must prepare for visitors, it's been a long time and much has changed since I last walked among others. (metal rattling) No, no, no! Stay down, stay asleep. (laughing) Please not now, I have guests. - [Yari Voiceover] Lord Geer, the time has come. Let them rise. (laughing) (peaceful music) - Watch your heads friends. This old place wasn't really meant for one of your stature. (peaceful music) (clattering) (groaning) It has been ages since I've entertained visitors. - [Shojun] Ow. (sniffing) - The air smells wrong. - This place has certainly seen better days. (groans) - This table's, table's cute. - Please, please excuse the mess. (peaceful music) (slurping) (metal tapping) - So you see why we want to continue your masters work. The Hollows are still as driven and dangerous as back in his time. And (groans), and you, (groans) and you are the only one left who knows something about them. Now can we do anything to stop their terrible change? - Master P'Torr realized all too late what he had wrought. But even he, he, he. (machinery clicking) Pard, pardon me. But even the master could not stop them. - [P'Torr] Oh the pain. - I'm so sorry, but it's true. Please, do not be upset with me. My master had to call on a much more powerful entity. So dangerous for mortals. An ancient creature of the mountains. - The mountain God, Y'Gimm. - Yes Terrapin. To wake the immortal, you need to find his heart. The white heart of the Mountain God. If you find it hidden deep within the earth, you will wake the sleeping God and stop the Hollows as before. - White ship. White heart. - You speak in riddles Lord Geer. Tell us, what is this heart? Where is it? - The heart, rests. (metal rattling) (suspenseful music) - [Soldiers Together] Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. - No, no, no, no, no. (screams) (thudding) (chain clinking) (groaning) (sputtering) (groaning) (clattering) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (sputtering) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (groans) (groaning) (clattering) (bones cracking) (groaning) No, no, no, no. Stay away. No. Get back. (metal clinks) (growling) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screaming) (machinery clicking) - Forgive me, do forgive me. Yari embedded her will in my gears. I, I could not dis, disobey her. Master, I am weak without you. - Madness, sheer madness! (clattering) She's slaughtering them, imprisoning them in living metal. I left my old world because of the wars there, how can Yari, my creation, my daughter commit such horrible acts? - Master, she took your actions and twisted them into her dark mind. She saw you giving life to your new automator and in her arrogance thought to do the same. Only she tries giving it to those who do not need it. - This cannot go on. I will end it here, today. - No, no you cannot. Stop. - What, what are you doing? Geer, stop this. I am your master. I command you to stop! (thudding) Has the madness seized you too? (sighs) (melancholy music) (hover board whooshing) Geer, you have served me well all these years but it is time for you to go. My faithful servant, you are free. (hover board whooshing) - M, master. (suspenseful music) - [Soldiers Together] Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. (groans) (electrical buzzing) (screaming) (laughs) (groaning) (metal thudding) (suspenseful music) (gasps) Serve the Hollows. (groans) - [Nani] Shojun! - [Soldiers Together] Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groans) (groans) Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. (water splashing) (metal clangs) (suspenseful music) Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. Serve the Hollows. - These old soldiers have been hibernating for too long. It has scrambled their minds. Their over-zealousness for combat has cost me my daughter and that, that is not good. You were supposed to bring her to me, intact. Ah, the Ovis woman we've captured, she's your sister isn't she? - But to serve, we must abandon family. We cannot look back. - Oh, don't be so quick to dismiss family ties. After all our service is to protect. Don't you wish to protect those who are closest to you Brujt? - As you wish Goddess Yari, you know what is best. You care about the entire world as if it were your own child. - True my captain, but isn't it remarkable how caring for the entire world makes you lose those you love sometimes. Do not repeat this mistake. Go to your sister. - But I don't under- Yes my Goddess, as you wish. (machinery clicking) (suspenseful music) - My child, have I lost you for good? Have I lost you just as I reclaimed the world? (sobbing) (door clangs) (machinery clicking) - Why lay there broken and defeated? Come on child. The conversion gives one new life, just like the stories told us remember? Just like we imagined when we were children, it's the dream of every Ovis. It is what we do. We serve the great Goddesses to save the flawed world from itself. A new body will protect you from the soot storms, and a new body, new life, let me help you. Like our mother told me to, I am your elder. I look after you. - You are not my brother. You are a shade of who he once was. (sobbing) (machinery clicking) (melancholy music) - (sighs) I cannot defy Yari. - How about this one? You like it? How about this one? This might do. How about this one, it's nice right? - No. It's so terrible and twisted. And I feel another spirit within it, just like in all the others. - These creatures are still alive? - Not alive. I don't know what they are. It's some terrible half existence I don't understand, but I can't abide. How could my sisters, how could Yari, the one who constructed me, let these creatures rot while a spark of awareness still flutters? What cruelty is this? - Forgive me for following you, but I couldn't help but feel responsible for your bodies destruction dear Hollow Sister. But I am a gifted mechanic perhaps, perhaps I could help you? - I don't trust you. When we met you betrayed us to the Hollows. - And it was a m, mistake. I only sought peace and quiet and then the Yari, the Hollow Queen, re, returned to my mind. I was not in control of myself or my actions. - Then I have every reason to doubt you now. - I mean only to help. And besides, do you even know how to build a Hollow? I stood by my masters side for years, making his mechanical children. And my master guides me, even now. - Shojun, perhaps we should consider his offer. - I don't trust him. But, for now. Okay Clockwork, show us you can make a new body for Nani. And remember I'm standing here with weapon in hand. (wings fluttering) - There you are. That old useless fool. Still he toys with disobeying me. (tool whirring) - No please. - You need someone to follow. (laughs) - No! (tool whirring) Terrapin, you may want to know, your people are in danger. - What danger? - Yari and the Ovis are closing in on your village. - How do you know? - Let me share a secret. When I was linked to the Queen, it did not run in just one direction. I saw what she was planning. - Then I'll leave right away. - No. - I will come with you, perhaps I can help. - No, you seem to mean well, but I can't trust you. Stay here and build Nani's body. It could be a trap or a lie, but I can't take the chance of being wrong. (tool whirring) (heavy breathing) - You're a cloud breather, yes? - (exhales) That I be. - Can you generate clouds in here? - How would that help us? - I'm a conjurer, I can tickle sprites from the mist. I think they can free us. - As you wish. (exhaling) (sprites moaning) (exhaling) (peaceful music) (suspenseful music) (wings fluttering) - Huh? (screams) (staff thuds) (screaming) (dramatic music) (groaning) - I pray I'm not too late. - Even then, what can you do alone? - Hush dear friend, this is my fight. I'd rather die protecting my home than live exiled from it. For your safety Nani. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (scratching) (groans) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Warrior. Though you may be a skilled warrior among your own people, your moves are slowed by the metal and mechanics you have adopted. - Let's hear your prattle when I skewer you, toad. (groans) - [Elder Masook] Sloppy. - We're not alone Nani, and look it's Geta with friends. (screams) (groaning) (thudding) (screams) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screaming) (groaning) (machinery clicking) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groaning) - Give up yet? (laughs) (groaning) - We'll see who's slow now? (bone cracking) (screams) (groaning) - See brother. Relatives are harder to hide from, but you won't die this day. (groaning) (electrical buzzing) (groaning) (thudding) (suspenseful music) - Father. (screams) I see you've met Geta. (groaning) - It's good to see some Ovis who haven't gone mad. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (thudding) (wings fluttering) (groaning) (screams) (groaning) (blood squelches) (groaning) (screams) (groaning) (gas hisses) (groaning) Take to the air. (groaning) (peaceful music) (groaning) - Look out! Um, wait a second. (groaning) (thudding) (machinery clicking) - What a fine prize we've found. Destroy them hound. (metal thudding) (dramatic music) (groaning) (groaning) (screams) (groaning) (metal clanging) (machinery whirring) (groans) (suspenseful music) (machinery clicking) (groaning) - Shojun! - I'll deal with you next witch. (machinery clicking) (groans) (groaning) (groans) - A taste of the Hidden Forest. (groaning) (gas hisses) (suspenseful music) - You and your idealism Terrapin. Let it continue to take you down the wrong path. Look, you see that Hollows offer? Protection from the killer soot. Warrior, how long can you keep this up? (groaning) Hi ya. (groans) Ooh, you're on the ground. Oh, we could help. Join us and then we can take this battle to the Tricksters above, the real villains. Let me be your refuge. - Not for the sacrifice you ask. - (laughs) Run and see if it solves the problem. Let the soot consume you then. We will return to pick through your remains. (water splashing) Hi ya! (water bubbling) (eerie music) (melancholy music) (water splashes) - I am sorry. Your father, he's been calling for you. (melancholy music) - Father, father. I'm sorry. I came too late. - Hush, foolish boy. It is not your fault you were cast away. If we, if I, hadn't made that terrible decision you would have been here with us where you belong. It is I who should be sorry. I am old enough to know that the law should be seen through loving eyes. Forgive me. - No, no, no, there's nothing to forgive father. And you mustn't regret anything. - You fought so bravely today. I know that you never abandoned your people. (melancholy music) Take this my son. It will be of use to you. Made in the blood of diamond stones, it cannot be broken. It will obey your command. - I will not fail your trust in me. - Now, the Hidden Forest beckons me. Lead my son, with wisdom. - Sleep father. Travel well. (melancholy music) (machinery clicking) - [Elder Masook Voiceover] I see the treetops as I approach the one tree itself. It's great bowels welcoming me. The sky glitters a million eternal stars. The Hidden Forest beckons me. (melancholy music) (groaning) (blood squelching) - Don't worry Nani, we will find you a body. For now, you and I will travel as one. You will be my sister, my other eyes. - And you will be my other heart. - We're still too few. We must stop Yari from raising her army. - The Hollows were not born villains, they were twisted to become that in their battle against the Tricksters. Maybe we can reverse things. Remember the heart of the mountain? Let's seek the heart and hope it gives us answers that are better than death. - I know where to find the white heart of the mountain. - Goddess, we have taken the prisoners and begun the conversion. You will soon have more soldiers for the war ahead. - Very good my one Brujt. Tell me. - Yes Goddess. - Why do they continue to resist me so? When I offer them the gift of protection from the soot storms, why do they continue to rebel? We offer them life over death. - I cannot say. - But their days are numbered. With each moment our ranks grow stronger and stronger, theirs dwindle. Surely they will understand and come to side with us before the end? - It is the way of progress my Goddess. - Shojun, you better come with me. The rest of you wait here. - Keep watch my brothers. Raise the alarm if the Hollows arrive. - I know this ship. From Yari's stories. This is P'Torr's ship. Didn't he die here? - Hmm? Come, there is more inside. (suspenseful music) - Huh? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we shouldn't disturb the dead. - I am not afraid of the dead. If the dead could speak, we would simply ask. But since he can't. This one has left us a gift. - By the Gods! - It fits. (machinery clicking) It feels right. I feel like, myself. (machinery squeaking) At last, I can move again. Even dance, see. - There will be time for dancing later. Help me with these controls, I do not know these letters and none of this makes sense. - I think I can decipher it. This dial here, it controls this power source and it seems to reach deep into the mountain. Legends make it all sound like magic, but it's not. This works by remotely controlling the flow of geothermal heat in the depths of the mountain. I think P'Torr had used this power to awaken the creature. It's connected to the mountain and the changes within it can either waken him or keep him in deep slumber, like this ship has been this whole time, ever since our exile to the moon. - I see you find the white heart, the exiles ship. I had to follow you, to tell you I have freed myself. And to see you discover your destiny. - Stay away. Stay away, you wretched Clockwork. - I truly wish to help. I realize you have your reasons to, to doubt my sincerity, but I assure you, I carry a deep shame about my betrayal, however unwilling. I w, wish only to prove to you that I speak the truth. I can help. I came here meaning to carry out P'Torr's last wish, to awaken the Mountain God, to silence the Hollow threat. - How can we know you're not lying to us again? Following my mother's orders. - Let me do this one last thing, you shall see. Let me stand by your side and wake the Mountain God. - I say let him try. We're all former enemies joined in alliance, couldn't any of us betray the rest? This is why we came here after all. - But we'll need to ensure the Hollows won't interrupt. - It's up to us then Shojun. Let Nani and old Tick Tock try and wake the God and the rest of us will distract the Hollows. - Attack them. - You said so yourself. It will likely be dangerous. And we are warriors are we not? Who knows we may succeed and, and I may get my brother back. - Then we go. (melancholy music) Nani, I don't know if I'll be coming back. - Please don't speak like this. Surely you'll return. We've been through so much already and I feel like we will see each other again. - You are a part of me and knowing you has changed who I am. I thank the Gods for that. May we meet again Patchwork Girl from the moon. (laughs) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) - Where have you been? - Look look, look look. - [Geta] Warriors, oh you've done well little friend. - Now, now we have a small army (laughs). (suspenseful music) (screaming) (groaning) (metal clinking) (thudding) (suspenseful music) - Lord Geer. - No, no, no! - Enough Lord Geer, as you call yourself. You are lord of nothing but weakness, cowardice. Even though we were made by the same set of hands, I am stronger than you are. You need someone to follow. - I came to talk to you, as an equal. - It is a deep urge isn't it? You still want someone to obey. - No please. - So be it, obey me. Yari of the Hollows. (laughing) - [Yari And Lord Geer] My precious daughter, my child, why have you strayed? - Mother how could you? You told me that you cared about this world. - [Yari And Lord Geer] I do. You only need to come back and see. - Come back and all will be forgiven. - [Yari And Lord Geer] I need you, for the greater war ahead of us. Against the Tricksters. - Not in a thousand years, I will not join you. Haven't you learned? Your wars have solved nothing. I've learned by living among the creatures of this world. They would choose freedom and life even with its suffering, to protection from harm and an eternal life of loyalty to a master. They would suffer the soot storms instead of being slaves to us. - What does it matter what those incapable of reason would choose? They need us. - Oh mother, please release the poor old Clockwork. (suspenseful music) - No tomorrow! (groaning) (electrical buzzing) (groaning) (screams) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screams) (machinery clicking) (groaning) (metal clanging) (groaning) - Oh. (machinery clicking) - Resist her Geer, free your mind from her. - Master, you've come back. - Move Geer, finish the mission. - Quickly, she's too distracted now to keep her hold on me. But that may not last. (machinery clicking) (gas hissing) (ground rumbling) (suspenseful music) (growling) (machinery clicking) (machine whirring) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (fire crackling) (growls) (suspenseful music) (roaring) (ground thudding) (rocks thudding) (roaring) (groaning) - Curse you Geer. Brujt! (groaning) My loyal captain. Take care of these pesky Terrapin, I must address the greatest danger of all. (groaning) (ground thudding) (screams) (roaring) I have stood up to my creator and I will stand up to you mountain giant. You will not stop me, I will defeat you or be crushed trying. But I will not be imprisoned again. (electrical buzzing) (growling) - Oh no. I can see through your mother's eyes. The Mountain God has awoken and it's a disaster. - What's happening? Geer, what are you saying? (screaming) (electrical buzzing) (screaming) - He will wipe this world clean of all life if he continues like this. Oh, what have I done. (growling) (suspenseful music) (metal scraping) (roaring) - Ya. (screaming) (screams) - Yari! - Lord Geer? (roaring) Mother, I wish it didn't end like this. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (groaning) (groaning) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (machinery clicking) (groaning) - Brother, I beg of you. Recognize me, recognize that we are one. Doesn't it hurt you? Doesn't it hurt you to see my blood, our people's blood? - What have I become? I am more machine than flesh now. What have I become? Geta, my sister. - Brujt, my brother. (machinery clicking) (suspenseful music) (rocks rumbling) (groans) - I don't think we can fight Y'Gimm. Follow me, Brujt, no more fighting. Now it's survival. Reach. (machinery clicking) - I guess the legends never tell the full truth. They are half understood whispers of the past. The so called God is too dangerous a solution, there is no one left to stop him except me. Am I no better than Yari? Seeking a cure worse than the disease? (machinery clicking) (suspenseful music) - Let me help. (machinery whirring) (suspenseful music) (spaceship whooshing) (machinery clicking) (spaceship whooshing) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) (rock cracking) Master. Master. - Rest friend, you've done well. The madness, it's over. (peaceful music) (rock tapping) (hover board whooshing) (peaceful music) (machinery clicking) (machinery whirring) - [Shojun] Nani! - Shojun! - You're alive and you have a mouth. - Call it my happy scar. I know she was so wrong, and yet I can't help but grieve for her. My mother. I wonder if there was anything anyone could have done to help her? Couldn't she be saved? (machinery clicking) (groaning) (rock smashing) (melancholy music) This is the original Yari, she's the one that came with the exile from the other world. - You're going to try to save her, aren't you? - Mommy. - No, sister. (machinery clicking) (peaceful music) - Here you go. You try it. A ball. (dog barking) Oh. (dog barking) (machinery clicking) (dog barking) - The time has come to start over. This is where we begin. (peaceful music) - [P'Torr Voiceover] Children of the earth make a home with descendants of the stars. Defying the rules and alliances of the past. Strange miracles abound. Hope grows and Yamasong heals. (peaceful music) (wings fluttering) (peaceful music) ¶ (suspenseful music)
