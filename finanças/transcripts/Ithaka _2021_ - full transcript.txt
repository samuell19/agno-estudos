I can't even remember how I feel about Julian Assange. I can't even remember how I feel about Julian Assange. WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks. 10 years ago, Assange shot to fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret documents provided by former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. WikiLeaks first caught the attention of most Americans when it released this video. It shows a US Apache helicopter crew in Iraq It shows a US Apache helicopter crew opening fire on a group of men. opening fire on a group of men. Some of them were journalists from Reuters. Come on. Fire. Keep shooting. Keep shooting. Keep shooting. Keep shooting. At least a dozen people were killed in the attack. We have clear evidence for war crimes having been committed. At least a dozen people were killed in the attack. We have clear evidence for war crimes having been committed. ..that the Metropolitan Police have arrested Julian Assange. Hear, hear! Arrested for breach of bail after nearly seven years in the Ecuadorian Embassy. He has also been arrested in relation to an extradition request He has also been arrested in from the United States authorities. from the United States authorities. The Obama administration couldn't figure out how to charge him from the United States authorities. The Obama administration couldn't figure out how to charge him without him being able to get journalistic protection. Right. I think it's pretty amazing, and the Trump administration should be, like, "Look at us. and the Trump administration "We figured it out." "We figured it out." "We figured it out." Now, after eight years of cat and mouse, Now, after eight years of cat and mouse, Julian Assange is on the precipice of extradition to the United States. You've said that you're proud of your son. You've now, if you like, broken cover, because we didn't really know about you until this morning, actually. Why have you decided that now is the time to speak up for him and to call for his repatriation to Australia? Well, he... Julian can no longer speak for himself, and so... so we... his family and friends must speak for him. Can we talk about the day Julian asked you to help? Can we talk about the day Can you talk me through that? Can you talk me through that? I don't really remember. Can you talk me through that? I don't really remember. What I remember is that he got arrested, and so I came here and... What I remember is that he got arrested, and so I came here and... ..went and saw him in the... ..went and saw him in the... ..went and saw Julian in the jail. Anyway, he was in a very bad way. OK. Yeah. Just... just tell me, how was Julian Assange? Oh, well, he's lost about 10 kilos weight, and he's psychologically under a lot of stress and pressure. The visiting hours are very, very precious. Sorry. I'm a bit upset. Yes. This is my first visit. Yes. Yes. Yes. That... Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - How was... was that... moving? How was... was that... moving? It's pretty moving, - How was... was that... moving? It's pretty moving, as you would expect. It's pretty moving, OK. Thanks. Pretty tough. For him, you know. I guess that'll do. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. So I said, "I'll... I'll be back." So I said, "I'll... I'll be back." You know, "I won't stop coming until you can come home." And I... I don't much like the media, but... ..it seems as though there's... was an avenue where I could contribute. Can we talk about your contact with Julian through his childhood? Can we talk about your contact Well, I don't think it's a... Well, I don't think it's a... ..you know, Well, I don't think it's a... ..you know, I don't think it'll help, will it? Well, just understanding that you didn't connect for a long time. Yeah. So why do we... I mean, frankly, why do we have to go over that again? Yeah. So why do we... I mean, frankly, It's a serious question. It's a serious question. Why do I have to go over the fact that I may not feel comfortable with your question? that I may not feel comfortable - Mmm. Mmm. Well, it's part of the story. It ISN'T part of the story. The story is that... you know, I am attempting, in my own humble... The story is that... you know, I don't like that word. I don't like that word. ..modest way to get Julian out of the shit. ..modest way What does it involve? What does it involve? Traipsing around Europe, building up coalitions of friendship. And I have the feeling that the desire for a narrative about Julian And I have the feeling that the is stronger than the desire is stronger than the desire to understand the person that you are speaking to, and what you're indirectly doing is making sense of life by imposing on life, as it flows past, a narrative, because that's what you... you want to see - a beginning, a middle and an end and a conclusion - which is a convenient... or what I would call which is a convenient... Hollywood way of looking at life. Hollywood way of looking at life. But, you know, life's not really like that at all. So, what you can do with these things... is that you can give it a destiny. I would prefer the difficulty of destiny I would prefer over the ease of narrative. over the ease of narrative. It's good to see you. Yeah. Julian is suffering from years of psychological torture, increasing to the extent of damaging him. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, Julian, of course, is not well. Um... Julian, of course, is not well. Um... So I'm an independent human rights expert So I'm an independent human rights expert who's appointed directly by the... the United Nations. who's appointed directly by the... the United Nations. Well, Julian Assange's case, who's appointed directly by the... the United Nations. Well, Julian Assange's case, it does involve my mandate on several levels, although I... I at first didn't think so, and... although I... I at first didn't think so, and... ..that's the... that's the deceptive nature of psychological torture. ..that's the... that's the deceptive nature of psychological torture. That... that's the purpose of psychological torture. It wants to torture people without the environment realising It wants to torture people someone is being tortured. someone is being tortured. Doesn't want to leave traces. Now, you DO leave traces, but it's in the mind. Torture is used to break people, very often to make them say what you want them to say very often to make them say or not to say anything. or not to say anything. But in Julian's case, it's about intimidating everybody else. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I started this thing, oh, what was it, '73, I think. Oh, oh, thank you. And if I had... And, really, tell him... ..you know, had that in my nature, I would have been there already. But I wasn't. You know, I liked building things. ..you know, had that in my nature, I would have been there already. But I wasn't. You know, I liked building things. Particularly liked building homes. You know, I liked building things. Particularly liked building homes. Particularly liked building homes. 'Cause a... a home, you know, is a stage for the theatre of life. 'Cause a... a home, you know, is a stage for the theatre of life. And it gathers the inhabitants under its roof like a hen gathers its chicks. So I liked that. That was what I liked doing, making those things. - So... - Ah. ..please have a seat. Thank... thank you. Alright. Just have to put this a little bit closer. - Thank... thank you. Alright. Just have to put this a little bit closer. Oh. That's OK for you? Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I last saw Julian at three years of age, and then we re-met when he was in his 20s, so, as a child, I can only go by what his mum says. I think his nickname was 'Wizard' and... and shortened to 'Wizzy', because he was precocious and inventive and... yeah. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Is that correct? He... He... ..called in one day, and we made tea and avocado toast, and we talked about secrecy, and we made tea and avocado toast, and we talked about secrecy, its benefits and its failures. and we talked about secrecy, And he said that the... And he said that the... ..quality of a society is founded upon the information that it can get access to in order to build something that is more sturdy and has deeper knowledge of itself and consequently can move to a higher plane of existence. They are... that is his but paraphrased, They are... that is his but paraphrased, over days, you know. because the conversations extended over days, you know. This movement is not about the destruction of law. It is about the construction of law! First met Julian in 2002, in my first physics lecture at the University of Melbourne. So Julian was a mature age student at the time, I think about 30 or so. in my first physics lecture at the University of Melbourne. So Julian was a mature age student at the time, I think about 30 or so. So Julian was a mature age student Really... interesting guy. Really... interesting guy. Really... interesting guy. Very much a passionate advocate for fairness, for justice. Very much a passionate advocate for fairness, for justice. Very much a passionate advocate We'd just gone to war in Afghanistan, We'd just gone to war in Afghanistan, and the question of whether Australia would go to war in Iraq and the question of whether was a topic of discussion, was a topic of discussion, and millions of citizens were marching, to see if we could stop this war taking place, that I think people of the time knew that it was a bit... it was bogus. It wasn't actually about the safety of the Iraqi citizens themselves or the safety of other nations around the world. And we saw this and we marched and we protested. No war! No, no, no! And nothing happened. It didn't lead to anything. And nothing happened. We still went to war. We still went to war. And Julian asked the question, "Well..." ..you know, "if... if marching civilians can't do it, "if letters to our politicians don't do it, if..." ..you know, "really good work by journalists "don't do it in everyday life, well, what WILL change? "What WILL enable us to prevent going to an illegal war?" After that, I received a broadcast email from him about WikiLeaks, and it was clear, actually, that a real revolutionary idea had been born, and Julian's idea, I think, was that providing this anonymous dropbox, that's not linked to any major media organisation. In some sense, actually, the idea behind it In some sense, actually, is actually just a kind of park bench is actually just a kind of park bench where a grey envelope can be left by someone, where a grey envelope picked up later by a journalist, picked up later by a journalist, and it used the power picked up later by a journalist, and it used the power of cryptography, and it used the power used the power of computation, used the power of computation, to enable that to happen in bulk on a scale that's never been seen before and to provide protections of anonymity and to provide that had never been seen before too. that had never been seen before too. I assume most of you have read... ..some of the... the morning papers. In July 2010, ..some of the... the morning papers. In July 2010, WikiLeaks and its collaborators In July 2010, went public with a massive leak. went public with a massive leak. The Afghan War logs came from a trove of 90,000 incident and intelligence reports. Almost 400,000 secret US military field reports painted a grim picture of the coalition's military activities, including torture and summary executions. Oh, yeah, look at those dead bastards. The principle behind it was remarkable - the ability to collect true information the ability that was never meant to be in public that was never meant to be in public and the power of that information to show the public what's really going on - and Julian's idea, I think, was that the goal is justice and Julian's idea, I think, and the method is transparency, and the method is transparency, to say that if we can... ..show what those conversations really are, ..show what those conversations the lobbying of military corporations the lobbying of military corporations or the lobbying of strategic interests or oil interests, or the lobbying of or whatever it might be, or whatever it might be, then that will help foster or whatever it might be, then that will help foster a real debate about the real questions of... of why we might go into conflict or why our governments might be making certain decisions. And too much of that conversation has been hidden, and I think Julian's passion and WikiLeaks's passion was to say, and I think Julian's passion "It's time for some of that scrutiny "It's time for some of that scrutiny "to be placed on these conversations, not on individual citizens." You know, the support in Europe's tremendous. Italy and Germany, Greece and now France have Italy and Germany, begun to move in Julian's direction. begun to move in Julian's direction. ..has changed dramatically since April, when he was dragged by police from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. A thin and confused-looking Julian Assange has been seen for the first time since his April arrest, the WikiLeaks founder struggling to remember his birthday has been seen for the first time since his April arrest, the WikiLeaks founder struggling to remember his birthday as he was told his extradition hearing WILL go ahead. Fronting Westminster Magistrates' Court in a navy suit and clean-shaven, Westminster Magistrates' Court in a navy suit and clean-shaven, in a navy suit and clean-shaven, was noticeably thinner, the WikiLeaks founder was noticeably thinner, struggling to remember his birthdate, saying, "I can't think properly." to remember his birthdate, saying, "I can't think properly." saying, "I can't think properly." Assange will remain behind bars until that full extradition hearing, Assange will remain behind bars until that full extradition hearing, which has been set down for the end of February. Assange will remain behind bars until that full extradition hearing, which has been set down for the end of February. This is an outrageous affront on journalistic protections. That's what this case represents, and that's why it's so important that he has adequate time to be able to prepare a... ..a full and proper defence to those allegations. It's important for people to understand It's important what the indictment is really about. what the indictment is really about. It included a raft of charges under the Espionage Act, what the indictment is really about. It included a raft of charges under the Espionage Act, including receipt and publication of material. Now, that's what made it very clear to journalists Now, that's what made it very clear that this was about journalism. that this was about journalism. that this was about journalism. The seriousness of this indictment, The seriousness of this indictment, in terms of the criminalisation of news-gathering activities, was abundantly clear once the United States government slapped 175 years and 17 potential charges slapped 175 years in relation to those publications. in relation to those publications. We will shortly be arriving at Farringdon. I met Julian because I had responded to I met Julian a email from Jennifer Robinson. a email from Jennifer Robinson. The legal defence team needed more people. The case was developing very quickly, and I was brought on to work on the US investigation. In the beginning of Julian being in prison, he could only call a few times a week, he could only call when he was in... when he was in... ..the unit for desperately suicidal or terminally ill people, and most of the time, they're in isolation. So that's where Julian was for about six months. I mean, Julian's had a... ..a very... ..difficult time in the prison. Yes, but that's not very nice. You have the nice one, the big one... Did you rest well? I did. Oh. Yourself? Oh. Yes, I did. I feel... I feel human. Yes, I did. I feel... I feel human. Yes, I did. I feel... I feel human. Yesterday, I felt like a monster. Yesterday, I felt like a monster. Dad? Yeah? Dad? I took off my shoes already. Severine, she asked when... when... when I'm gonna get Julian out of jail, yeah. I'm gonna Severine thinks it's an immediacy. Severine thinks it's an immediacy. We're just coming to pick him up, you know, get in the cab and... She doesn't really see that we might end up in America She doesn't really see fighting this battle. fighting this battle. You know, I find myself very different, you know, in that I have cultivated within myself a love of family, because when I left school, or my father died, after he died, because when I left school, I got all the family photographs - I got all the family photographs - oh, there was a fucking heap, I tell you - and I burnt them. I wasn't going back there, not for quids. I wasn't going back there, - What... you know... What... you know... ..what was going on when you did that? Oh, who knows? You know. Humans are complex. Um... ..and... ..so I built... ..copying from books and plays and... ..mentors... ..the elements of families in myself, yeah, so I built it. It's a hou... it's my mansion, you know, and it has all these rooms, which I've... ..decorated and put furniture in, and I move into them. No, that was me. It's still bottoming out somewhere. I want to stay with you. Darling, we have to go. We have to go. OK? We have to go. OK? I want to be with you. Huh? Becau... you can't because we can't get in the jail. Becau... you can't We're going to places no children... We're going to places no children... ..it's just an awful place We're going to places no children... ..it's just an awful place I'm going to today. OK. For whom? For the lawyers? When you say 'us', I don't understand. Oh. OK. OK. talked about how he... when he was... Julian's always talked about how he... when he was... ..you know, when he was a child, growing up, he always... ..knew he was different, and he says... ..knew he was different, ..that he wasn't... ..that he wasn't... ..he wasn't afraid of an alien abduction. He was hoping that it would happen soon because he felt like an alien. He... this must be the explanation, right? He... this must be So it was very funny to... to know that Julian and... and John So it was very funny to... to know that Julian and... and John had only reconnected that Julian and... and John when Julian was already a... when Julian was already a... ..you know, a mature adult. Because Because they are very similar in some ways. Because I mean, I think it's very... I mean, I think it's very... ..in ways that are noticeable even to people who don't know them personally. Their thought processes are recognisable - Their thought processes ability to abstract... ability to abstract... ..storytelling... ..and kind of a cheeky sense of humour. ..and kind of And he's been really... And he's been really... ..really good. I get upset in that fuckin' place. Three suicides and one murder this month. And when did you first know about Julian and Stella? Generally speaking... ..unlike other people... ..I don't invade people's privacy, nor I am... ..curious as to what... who's going out with whom. ..curious as to what... Um... Um... ..so... ..if I saw anything that intimated... ..intimacy... ..I... ..ignored it or put it under the list of familiarity. They've spent 10 years being pursued by four powers, one of them by four powers, one of them being the foremost power on earth. In an extraordinary twist to the WikiLeaks story, Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblower website, has taken refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London. has taken refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London. - Assange is seeking asylum Assange is seeking asylum because he fears extradition to Sweden may lead to his transfer to the United States, where he could potentially face charges relating to WikiLeaks. It was around 2015 that we got together in the embassy, and we discussed the impossibility of having children for a long time. and we discussed the impossibility And we experienced this both as... And we experienced this both as... ..as a massive tragedy, because we had found each other, and in 2016... it seemed like 2016 was a turning point, because the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had just ruled in favour of Julian and against the UK, saying that they were holding him without any legal basis and that they were actually violating international law by keeping him in the embassy, and... and... and that they were actually violating international law by keeping him in the embassy, and... and... by keeping him in the embassy, and... and... ..and it just seemed like... ..and it just seemed like... ..clearly, it was just a matter of time before Julian could walk free. ..clearly, it was just a matter of time before Julian could walk free. So when we decided to start a family, So when we decided to start a family, it was in a context where there were no charges, it was in a context there was no investigation, there was no investigation, there was no reason for Julian to be stuck in that embassy. So we had Gabriel in mid-2017, and then I would bring him into the embassy with my friend Stephen, and... and that way, Julian was able to see our baby, and that continued for about six months. Obviously, the Embassy of Ecuador is a very small apartment, but we... we couldn't have Julian on his own. We didn't have a security company. but we... we couldn't have Julian on his own. We didn't have a security company. We didn't have security personnel We didn't have a security company. We didn't have security personnel for the first two months. That's why we... I was... I was with Julian full-time in the embassy. That's why we... I was... I was with Julian full-time in the embassy. Uh... Uh... ..everything changed. Absolutely everything changed. WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service. and talks like a hostile intelligence service. - The reaction from the US government The reaction from the US government after the publication of the CIA material, after the publication it felt like there was a change, it felt like there was a change, which was indicated publicly by Mike Pompeo saying that WikiLeaks was a hostile non-state intelligence agency and that the First Amendment should not be used to benefit and that the First Amendment Julian Assange and foreign nationals Julian Assange and foreign nationals who publish information about the United States. Immediately after that, we saw the US attorney-general saying that it was a priority to prosecute Julian. It was a clear strategy that emanated from the CIA. Very soon after the publication of Vault 7... ..I can see a breaking point when Ecuador stopped protecting ..I can see a breaking point when Ecuador stopped protecting Julian Assange. when Ecuador stopped protecting Violent clashes have erupted Violent clashes have erupted on the streets of Ecuador's most populous city following the country's knife-edge presidential election result. The win also has implications outside of Ecuador, with the fate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange directly tied to the election result. directly tied I could... I could... ..see obviously that... ..the government had already shifted completely its politics, in approaching the United States in order to build a new relationship. in approaching the United States in So soon after, they change all... So soon after, they change all... ..the cameras So soon after, they change all... ..the cameras existing in the embassy. These cameras were only three years old. There was not any need were only three years old. There was not any need to change them. to change them. You know, the whole place was basically bugged by the CIA. was basically bugged by the CIA. Beginning of 2018, there was a grab team posted outside the embassy during the Christmas period. You know, the streets were deserted outside and there this was car that was there, conspicuous, and there this was car for... for us to see, for... for us to see, and I remember John was there, for... for us to see, and I remember John was there, and we had... ..we had Christmas dinner and... ..and we... you know, we knew these... these guys were sitting out there. We found out that there were plans to kill Julian We found out by poisoning him and... by poisoning him and... ..abducting him from the embassy. Um... ..they grew... ..increasingly aggressive. We were all noticing ..increasingly aggressive. We were all noticing more unidentified cars, people around the embassy. We all felt that the level of surveillance on all of us We all felt that the level of surveillance on all of us became more intense. became more intense. And we now know that we were right to feel that. The CIA made plans to assassinate Julian, to kidnap him, to arrange for him to be dragged out of the embassy, which ultimately he was. I mean, the level of intrusion into HIS life, and into OUR lives, I mean, the level of intrusion as his lawyers... as his lawyers... ..as people who... ..as people who... ..friends who went to visit him... ..friends who went to visit him... ..anyone who went to see him was under this kind of surveillance. It got so bad that I had... ..I was afraid about walking home at night. Because I thought, you know... ..I could just be beaten up and assaulted or even killed just as a message to Julian. and assaulted or even killed just as a message to Julian. And that's why towards the... ..the final three months of my second pregnancy, we decided it was best for me not to go in. And thank you for the gracious welcome that you have shown to me on our very first visit to Ecuador. that you have shown to me - So in that period, So in that period, we had the visit of Vice-President Pence, which was the highest US operative to ever visit Ecuador. And we know that in that conversation... And we know that ..the asylum of Julian, ..the asylum of Julian, when he met the president, was on the agenda. when he met the president, The historical dependence of... The historical dependence of... ..of many South American countries, The historical dependence of... ..of many South American countries, and Ecuador in particular, ..of many South American countries, on the United States is so huge, on the United States is so huge, economic dependence and political dependence... ..that... ..they don't need to come out with a concrete financial offer to say, "I will give you this in exchange of this." They just... they just bang the table and say, "Our relationship is going wrong "as... as long as this man is still in there." No? Oh, wow. We have a lot of... stories to get through tonight. I will help you, Mama. Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Shall we start with The Gingerbread Man? Yeah. Alright. "Once upon a time, there was a little old man. Alright. "Once upon a time, there was a little old man. "Once upon a time, there was a little old man. "One day, the little old woman made a gingerbread man." "One day, the little old woman made a gingerbread man." Maybe Fergus Finds a Friend? The Saggy Baggy Elephant? That's quite good. And the Going on a Lion Hunt? Did you say you knew that one? Mmm. It's the... the bear hunt one. They know the bear hunt one. "We're going on a bear hunt." Oh, yeah. "We're gonna find..." Yeah. "..a big one." Can we come in? Ah. She cannot talk 'cause we've got to keep still. Extraditions are 99% politics and 1% law. It's entirely the... ..political climate around the case that decides the outcome, and that is shaped by the... by the media. And for many years, there was a climate that was created, deliberately created, through false stories, through smears, through kind of a character... ..relentless character attacks on Julian, to try to reduce that support and make it more possible, um... ..more likely, to successfully extradite him to the United States. ..more likely, to successfully And... I think it took about a year And... I think it took about a year to really feel like I was in a place where I could go public. Oh, where are those notes? Can I just have a look? Oh, where are those notes? Yeah. Thank you very much for talking to us. I want to ask you first of all how you first met Julian Assange Thank you very much for talking to us. I want to ask you first of all how you first met Julian Assange and what you thought of him when you first met him nine years ago. I met Julian in Paddington, at the Frontline Club. I thought he was intriguing, a man with a... with a mission. I thought he was intriguing, a man with a... with a mission. Julian Assange went into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London Julian Assange went into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London because he wanted to avoid being extradited to Sweden Julian Assange went into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London because he wanted to avoid being extradited to Sweden to face questioning about allegations of sexual assault. to face questioning You know that case very well. You know that case very well. What did you think of the allegations made by Miss A and Miss W against him? by Miss A and Miss W against him? What has to be understood about the Swedish preliminary investigation, What has to be understood about the Swedish preliminary investigation, because it was always a preliminary investigation, because it was always was that Julian always cooperated. was that Julian always cooperated. He did not go into the embassy because he was avoiding questioning. In fact, he was offering questioning. Julian was never charged. None of their names should have been leaked, including Julian's. None of their names should have I think the Swedish prosecution... I think the Swedish prosecution... It's too long. I told him it's too long, but they don't take any notice of me. I told him it's too long, but One hour maximum. One hour maximum. These stupid PR people. Just sick of them. Earlier this year, you said, "Everyone has failed Julian. "We've all failed Julian." What did you mean? I mean that Julian... ..is... ..extremely vulnerable, now physically in the country's highest-security prison. He's in there because he exposed torture. He's in there The contrast... The contrast... ..just the... Sorry. ..the injustice is overwhelming. And it's hard year after year. I don't think this is people's values. I don't think they think that people who expose war crimes should go to prison for the rest of their lives. Uh, perhaps... Do you want some... tissue, yeah? Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Use this one. Thanks. Pear. You're eating pear. How do you deal with the fact that... ..your fiance may lose his fight against extradition, he may be sent to America, he may be tried, he may be jailed? he may be sent to America, How do you cope with that? How do you cope with that? It's not a... it's not a choice. Um... you love who you love, and... Um... you love who you love, and... ..I love Julian for the courageous person he is, and I'll stand by him. Oh, my God. It was, like... I said that. I said that. I said that, and I think that's why they kept on going back to it, because they... I...they didn't get the answer they wanted. Anyway. It was always gonna happen with her. Open the door. Anyway. It was always gonna happen with her. Open the door. Open the door. Julian's legal team contacted me, When Julian's legal team contacted me, I have to admit, I mean, I... I just saw the message I have to admit, I mean, I... I just saw the message kind of coming up on my screen, kind of coming up on my screen, "Julian Assange's legal team ask for your protection." "Julian Assange's legal team ask for your protection." And I immediately had this reaction of, And I immediately had this reaction of, "No, I'm not gonna get into this. I'm not gonna do this." But this reaction was not based on an objective evaluation, and I have to admit today, to my shame, it was just an emotional reaction based on prejudice that I had in myself I wasn't even aware of. that I had in myself Why am I admitting to my prejudice? Why am I admitting to my prejudice? Because I think... ..all of us had them at some point, Because I think... ..all of us had them at some point, maybe... ..all of us who had not been in a personal contact with Julian Assange ..all of us who had not been in a have been affected by this, have been affected by this, because this is the public narrative that has been spread in the media for 10 years, and no-one has been able to... ..actually see how much deception there is. ..actually see Why is this being done? Why is this being done? For 10 years, all of us have only focused on Julian Assange, when he never wanted it to be about him. when he never wanted it It never WAS about him. It never WAS about him. It was about the States and their war crimes and their corruption. That's what HE wanted to put the spotlight on. That's what HE wanted And he did. And he did. And that's what made them angry.
