For Frederico - 1979 "The International Year of the Child" - What time is the train? - At nine. We'll be there on time. There's no need to hurry. Hard winter coming. Winter in the mountain is great! Hardship... I like winter in the mountains! You're lucky. I've never been on a train. I've seen one three times, but I've never been on board. MORNING MIST Be decent, boy! Come in. Wait here a minute. I'm going to call the rôle. Alvaro Campos. Come. Sit here. Amílcar Esteves. António dos Santos Lopes. Is that you? Adolfo Almeida. In those days, Jesus said to the Scribes and Pharisees: "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you the prophets, and wisemen and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city; That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood Of Zacharias son of Zarachias, whom ye slew betwee the temple and the altar... "Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation". - What's your name'? - Antonio Santos Lopes. - Where are you from? - Linhares. -What does your father do? - He worked in the fields. - What's your name? - Gaudêncio da Silva. - Where are you from? - Vale de Prazeres. - And what does your father do? - I haven't got a father. He was a miner. He's dead. Don't cry Gaudêncio. I want to go home. You'll see, you'll stop missing home. I want to go home! - Why are you crying? - I want to go home. When break is over, go to my room. Silence! - What did Father Alves say to you? - Nothing! Did he give you a row? Did he hit you? What did he say? - Nothing! Silence! Would all boys who have any kind of foodstuffs please go and get them and hand them over immediately. Well? I'm not giving them my figs! Put the food in here. Come on! Everyone! I'm not handing over my figs! In the name of Christ our Lord I welcome all you seminarists, and above all you who have entered this college for the first time. "Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt", were the words of Christ spoken by St. Matthew. Blessed are the pure in head, for they shall see God. And this is the prime virtue you must cultivate within yourselves. Because if the head is pure, if the body and soul are pure, and if you cultivate within yourselves the innocence of children, then all the other virtues will be granted you. You cannot meditate enough on the infinite mercy of God that has chosen you from so many boys of your age who are out there in the world, exposed to all the dangers to their souls and salvation. You cannot meditate enough on the infinite grace of the Lord that has made you distinct from the others in being His representatives on earth, and agents in the salvation of men. Good! Now, if you like, you can write to your families. "Dear Mother and Brothers, I miss you very much. I'm very sad here. There are lot of boys of my age, but we can't talk to one another. At night I feel cold and miss you, mother, and our village. I'd like to be there with you all. I'm so lonely, and this school is so big and dark! I want to leave here! I want to go home. I don't want to stay here any longer. I've almost finished the figs. My love to everyone, especially to you mother, asking for your blessing... All letters must be handed in open. Don't you know the rules yet? So, aren't you handing in your letter? Show me your letter. António Santos Lopes! - Are you António Santos Lopes? - Yes, Father. You must go and see the rector. What have you done, child? Well, what have you done? I wrote a letter saying I wanted to leave here. Childish nonsense! Go on, son. Don't be afraid. It's not serious. Come in. Sit down. Do you know why you're here? Yes, I know, Sir. No, I don't know! Well, where are we? Do your know or not? I think it's because of the letter, but I'm not sure. You're not happy in the seminary? Yes, I am, Sir. I'm very happy in the seminary. So why did you say you wanted to leave? Haven't you been well treated? Yes, Sir, I've been very well treated! Haven't the Fathers been friendly towards you? Yes, they have, Sir. They're very friendly. Don't you get on well with your colleagues? Yes, Sir, I do very well, but, it's that I miss home. No suffering can pay for God's favour. Homesickness or whatever else are nothing, beside divine grace. God has cast a glance of infinite mercy over you. - Don't you understand that? - Yes, I understand very well, Sir. The dignity of the priesthood is above all the glories in the world and it is almost blasphemy to compare wordly affairs with the unique privilege of being another Christ on earth. God could have chosen another boy, but He chose you, and lifted you from misery and perdition. Don't you realise that this is a priceless favour? - Yes, Sir. What could you hope for living with your family? That virtuous lady, Madame Estefânia, lifted you out of misery and possible eternal condemnation. You have no father... - No, I haven't, Sir. What could you hope for, even with respect to material assets? A destiny of misery and poverty. But that's not important, because a priest cannot aspire to wordly wealth. More important for a priest is the perfection of his soul and through divine grace gaining a place amongst the elect in the heavenly paradise. How long does a life last? God's plans are unfathomable. But were He to grant us in His infinite mercy a long life, of pleasure what is that to infinite eternity? What point is there in a life of pleasure if at the end an eternity in Hell awaits us? But here in the seminary, and later in the divine office of the priesthood, you have the possibility of deserving eternal salvation. Do you really think you want to go home to your family? No, Sir, I don't. Go in the peace of God. Pray to Him that He may free you of evil temptations. Yes, I'll pray, Sir. I'll pray right away. Thank you very much, Sir. "Dear Mother, I' am very happy to be here in this fine seminary, freeing myself of the sins of man and trying to attain the supreme goodness of God. Everyone is kind to me. Everything is very pleasant and when I miss you I have to dominate the feeling because it is the work of the Devil. How are you a||?..." I choose Gaudêncio for brigadier. I choose Lourenço. For colonel I want Fabião. I want Semedo. I want Peres as captain. And I'll have Taborda. For second soldier I'll have António. I'll have Raul. Florentine! I'll take Carlos Pereira. Go back to your seats. Now, I'm going to explain how the game works. The class is divided into two armies, or two parties which are going to fight. And each soldier fights for himself. Each pupil who wants to be promoted can challenge any other in a higher rank in the same army. But no one can challenge someone in a lower rank. However, you can challenge someone of equal rank in the opposing army. A religious image will be allotted to the army that commits the fewest mistakes. Perhaps you haven't quite understood. I'll explain again. Let's take the example of Florentino who is drummer-boy, that is the lowest rank. He can challenge all the colleagues in his army and also the other drummer-boy in the opposing army. Now let's take the case of Tavares, who is first soldier. He can challenge the sargents, the lieutenant, the captain, the major and on up to the general in his army if he wants promotion. He can also challenge the first soldiers in the opposing army. When a challenge is made to an opponent the mistakes are counted. At the end of the week a small religious image will be drawn by those in the winning army. Challenges can be made in the next Latin lesson. Anyone wishing to make a challenge chooses his opponent in writing, on a paper to be given to me. Now, before the battle each general must commend his army to a saint. Both Adolfo and Amílcar can choose patron saints for their armies. Father Lino, I choose Saint Anthony as the patron saint of my army. Our patron saint is Saint Louis. On your knees. You will stay there for an hour. Everyone will study! Carlos Pereira challenges his opponent, Florentino. Come to the blackboard. Who wants to be an arbiter? Tavares, you put your hand up first. - Dative plural of "filia"? - "Fillis". No, no, "Filliis". "Filiabus". What's the vocative singular of "deus"? - It's "dee". - No, it's "deus". Now, what's the genitive plural? - It's "deorum". - But there's another. - I don't know. It's "deum". And what's the vocative of "filius"? - It's "filie". - No, it's "fin". - What are heteroclite nouns? - "Heter" what? - Heteroclites. - I don't know. They're irregularly declined nouns, either in some or all cases. Fine! That's enough for today. Florentino, do you want to take your revenge? Don't you want to ask Carlos Pereira anything? I haven't got anything to ask. In that case sit down, please. Lopes, do you like the seminary? No, Gama, I don't like it at all. Me neither! I'm going to try and tell my mother again that I haven't got the vocation. She wants me to be a priest. But if she makes me come back here again, then I'll... - You'll what? Nothing! Well, Gama, you're going back to your village now and I to mine. We probably won't see one another again. It's possible. Stop. Slowly. Spiritual reading will always be preceded by reading three articles of these rules and followed by an examination of your own conscience. Article 19: On Moral and Civil Duties. Seminarists should take great care to keep their heads pure of any blemish. They should guard well the entry to the senses. They should not have private friendships, so unfavourable in any community. Such friendship is prohibited as well as any familiarity. Without exception, all should practice one with another, a truly brotherly, attentive and dedicated affection. Article 20: Touching one another immodestly or grossly, is prohibited, as well as catching one another and rolling on the ground. Consequently all pranks and games are prohibited for those who aspire to the priesthood. Article 21: Passing papers, letters or notes to one another is prohibited. You, infamous sinners, only concerned with the pleasures of the world now accomplish the journey that cannot be escaped. Be thrown to the flames of hell. - Come to us sinners, come to us. The eternal fire awaits you. - Lord, have pity on us! Accept our repentance and lead us to your paradise. You must follow the chosen path. Nothing can save your from perdition and the dark. Your destiny has been dictated. Pay the consequences. - Mercy! You who have tasted the pleasures of the earth, now feel the damnation of hell the flames that consume your sinner's soul! Come my children to the eternal glory... ...of the saved and raise yourselves... above evil and the demons of temptation. With the end of this play it is time to read you some advice for the holidays that are near at hand... Silence. The arrival of the holidays should not worry you. I warn you not to fall prey to childish happiness that is undignified at your age and for clerical gravity. Instead of rejoicing, the arrival of the holidays should only worry you with respect to the dangers to which you will be exposed, far from the protective walls of this school. And now, some advice for the holidays. The seminarist should have a fixed hour for getting up so that he is not in bed for more than 7 hours, nor for long after he wakes up. Dress quickly and modestly in silence, thinking about the theme for meditation. Do not appear before no one without being properly dressed. Avoid bad company. Do not read unfavourable books, papers or novels, and do not frequent places where religion is condemned and condemnable acts are practiced, unsuitable for a seminarist. Attend the Holy Sacrifice of mass every day. Just before dinner read a chapter from the New Testament on your knees. Undress modestly and fall asleep with some good thought, crossing the arms over the chest. If it is your habit then kiss your mother, aunts or sisters, but it is suffice to greet more distant relatives, neighbours and friends courteously. Under all circumstances, the manners and words of a churchman should always show a certain composure, the result of long training. Manual work that you can do for pleasure should be in accord with suitability to your studies and habit. You should not forget your present state. It would not be suitable for your to work in the fields with the workers, or even with your parents. And if they ask you or order you to carry out these task you must excuse yourself politely. See you after the holidays. - Perhaps... - Goodbye. - Write to me. - OK, Gaudêncio. I'll write. - So how's our priest? - Fine, Sir. Look, it's António! When will you say mass? I don't know yet. Not for a while yet. Good evening, Sir. Hello! Already on holiday? What a fine life, your holiness! Joana, take António to his room. António, arrange your things and come and have dinner. This year you will still eat in the kitchen. Next year you will eat with us. A future minister of God should get used to coping with all the social classes. Well, my love, do you like the seminary? Yes, Aunt Joana. Some priest! António. It's time to get up! I'll wait for you downstairs to go to mass. - You called, Captain? - Bring my breakfast. Really, Sir! Is he healthy enough to come early to mass? Healthy enough? My dear Prior! Why shouldn't he be healthy enough to come to morning mass? I've already told him: as long as he is in my house he will not miss morning prayers, meditation, mass and evening rosary for one day... And he shouldn't forget the little visit to the Holy Sacrament. Nor his prayers at night, the examination of the conscience and spiritual reading. Do you think he can visit his mother? Yes, of course, she is his mother after all. You don't realise that these people only set bad examples. If his mother wants she can come to my house and see him. Yes, maybe, why not. No scenes like this here. Go into the kitchen if you want. There's no point, Madam. I'm going right away. Goodbye, António. See you soon. Goodbye, mother. I'm glad you came. Well, Tónio, what's become of you? Are you already a priest? That'|| be a long time yet. Aren't you coming with us to fetch firewood? He doesn't want to mix with us. Come in. Sit down here with us. Move up. Let António sit down. Give me the bowl. - Did you have a good journey, son? - Yes, mother. And your godmother? Is she well? Eat something. Watch how you're eating, pig. Have some bread. There are problems at the factory. Things aren't going well in Covilhâ either. Here are some sweets. They're not just for you, they're for everyone. Be quiet. Tell me something, nephew, now that you're learning to be a priest, why do they say mass in Latin? What are the padres saying? Latin's a very ancient language. It's very difficult. There are six cases alone. I've only learnt a little so far, I don't really know what it all means. Another thing. How much do you think a padre earns? Is it worth it? If it paid something, I'd become your sacristan. You, a sacristan? Do you think you'd learn how to assist at mass! Only if it were to eat cheese and drink the wine from the cruet. Scoundrel I am! I could stuff myself there! But with the cheese and all you've still chosen some life. Damn it! Can't you at least have a woman! That's enough, you brute. Don't talk like that to him. - Well, I'm going. - Already, son? It's time. They don't know I'm here. God bless you, my boy. Don't you bother with what these brutes say. There's nothing worse than them. "Dear Gaudêncio, I'm writing as promised. I'm sorry I haven't written sooner but times goes so quickly here that I didn't notice the days passing. Now there are only a few days before we go back. Are you still not coming back?" Is that good? You fancy it already, don't you? Tónio, when are you going to say mass? What are you doing here with that expression? Nothing, Madam. I'm going to my room. No, you're not. I must have a long talk with you. I'll join you in the drawing room. Sit down. No, no. Here. Closer. I've noticed that you look sad these days, Antonio. Very sad, I can see it clearly. On one hand it's normal. You have to leave us and your village again when the holidays end. But there's sadness and sadness. Your is different. It's malignant. Demons have come upon you and darkened you soul. But we shouldn't predict God's plans. When I brought you here it was for the greater glory of God and the greater spiritual honour and gain for you and me. God's plans are unfathomable and we cannot dream of opposing them. "Many are called, but few chosen", said Jesus. I wanted you to be a priest of Christ. But that will only be if God has chosen you. How many times we fool ourselves? We think we hear God's voice, but God is silent. But it can also be that we do not hear God's voice because we are full of the sounds of the Devil! Before calling you here, I asked the Lord to enlighten me. But I don't know if the infinitive mercy of the Lord heard me. Because I've been wondering in the last few days if you really have a vocation. What do you think, António? You are still, of course, very young not to be mistaken in you judgment. I spoke to the Prior about this and he said I should ask you to ask yourself. You can imagine the immense disappointment I would feel if Divine Providence had not chosen you. But shame on me if I were to oppose those schemes. The life of a priest is a life of sacrifice. But a clergyman is another Christ and there is no glory in the world compared to this. Your are a child, but you can already understand this clearly. What do you think? Have you a vocation or not? Be careful of what you say! Think well. Ask God to enlighten you! If you like I'll leave you while you meditate. You don't have to, Madam. I have no vocation. What! No vocation! Good-for-nothing! What will become of you, wretch? In rags, starving, you'll eat stones if you're hungry! He has no vocation! He has more vocation for picking up crust of bread and lice. Look at the little lord with no vocation! Perhaps you prefer to be a graduate. Your mother can send you to study in Coimbra. So if you have no vocation then get out! Go and die of hunger at home! Go and eat straw! Not one more minute here. Out! Well, António? Have you reflected with God on what you said? Do you feel you have vocation? Yes, Madam, I have. So, you've changed your mind. Are you sure you have a vocation? Watch what you say. If you have no vocation no one will oblige you to go back to the seminary. You'll go home to your mother. Have you really got a vocation? Yes, Madam, I have. Good, my boy. Thank God for saving you from temptation. Go and ask God to defend you always from the snares of the Devil. And pray for me too, because you have made me ill. Tell Carolina that you will have dinner with us today in the dining-room. Have you finished your essays? No more writing now! Let's hear how António Santos Lopes describes a spring morning. "Before the sun rises the men go to work". Just a moment. You still don't know how to develop the potential of the theme sufficiently. You must create poetry. Surround reality of facts with the delicacy of the word. Amílcar. Read what you've written. "Like the sacred Host rising from the pyx of the mountain, the sun rose sowing golden rays and the little birds hopped from branch to branch chirping gently... Do you see? Do you all understand? Father Thomas, what does pyx mean? Do you know why they've called us here? No, I've no idea. - Have you seen Gama? - No. How can one think of this house of God as a prison? How can the priesthood be thought of as violence? "My yoke is light", said Christ. It is true that not all those called, are chosen. It is true that God has not given all of you the infinite grace needed for the priesthood. But those chosen should humble themselves in prayer and ask God to enlighten them. Those should go to their spiritual advisor and ask his council. An, unfortunate seminarists who prefer the giddiness of the mondaine world to the unique glory of being, here on earth, an "alter ego" of Christ. It is true that one can achieve eternal salvation in the world. But what misery and dangers to overcome! Ah, how these unfortunate seminarists are mistaken, looking at wordly pleasures with infernal imagination. Hallucinated by the Devil, they prefer to soil their hands in crime and ignominity. Because expulsion is a stain that can never be removed. Ah, what pain! What and unspeakable affront when out there one day someone throws this bloody blemish in you face: "He was expelled. He was expelled from the seminary". Do you really not know what's happened? Two seminarists ran away last night, but they caught them this morning at the station. They're locked in their rooms and now they're going to expel them. - Expel them, Gama? Yes, expel them. So what? Or do you believe the story of the stain means something? This guy's a fool. Making us afraid doesn't work. I know a lot who were expelled and they couldn't give a damn now. These two were idiots to get caught. But one day... - How did they escape? They got to the station and hung around there 'till morning. Someone must have seen them and warned the seminary and the station master. Father Thomas went and brought them back in the cart. He was questioning them all morning. - Who planned the escape? - Just us. No one else. There must be more involved! You will confess even if I have to beat you! Confess! Forgive them, Sir! They didn't know what they were doing! It was the Devil! What's going to become of them? They should have thought of that before! Shame on you! Well? Have you forgotten where you are? Beg the Rector's forgiveness. - Forgive us, Sir! Don't expel us! - Never! That would be a scandalous example. Go and follow the path of perdition that you have chosen. "Search for death by causing death. Sebastian seeks death crying: It is time. This death is the salvation". - What's going on? - I don't know. Looks nasty!... "The Black Hand has left a letter in the parlour saying that one of these days he'll set fire to the seminary". Attention! Water! Bring water! The fire is spreading up the mountain! - And the seminary? - Nothing's happened to it. The wind is carrying the fire towards the mountain. Quickly! Bring water! Do you know what happened to Black Hand? They've caught him! - Here in the seminary? On the mountain. The National Guard. After a hold-up he hid in a disused mine. The National Guard surrounded him, and there was a lot of shooting. The Guards has pistols, rifles, machine guns and swords. Black Hand was hidden at the entrance to the mine until he had no more ammunition. Then the Guard advanced and killed Black Hand. His photo was in the paper. I saw the page in the toilets. "To the rector: Either you release all the seminarists in eight days, or the Seminary will blow up... "Seminary" isn't like that. "Black Hand does not forget". What's this? Off to class, all of you! "Dear Mother and Brothers, I hope this letter finds you all in good health. Everything's fine at the Seminary. The time is going by and in this second year we have more subjects. Besides Portuguese language and Latin, we also have Geography, which I quite like. Latin gets harder and harder, we have to work hard but I have good marks. One of these days I'll be back again for the holidays... It was him. They've caught him! He wrote Black Hand's letters. Father Thomas caught him putting another paper on the wall. Who are your accomplices? Who helped you? Was it you who set fire to the Seminary? Who knew about your plan? Who helped you? You won't get anywhere with this silence! You're going to be expelled, and never allowed here again, damned soul. Father Pita! Call those who had bad marks in behaviour and Gama's friends. I'll question them and find out who's behind this folly. I will find out even if I have to beat all of them. I did it all alone. Nobody knew anything! Come in! Come in. Come here. Why have you been looking so sad lately? I'm not sad, Father Alves. Why do you lie, my son? How old are you? - I'm thirteen at the end of July. - Thirteen? So, you're a man. Time flies and one forgets and falls behind. A man! The dangers are coming, the great and only dangers. The world and its dream. You must have thought of that often. Listen... One day the world came to meet me. It came complete, horribly full of pride and blindness. And what strange blindness! What pride! The great flame! And after? After, ashes and nothing else, my son. You see... Ashes and nothing else. Nothing remains of this flesh that torments us. Have you already spoken to your spiritual advisor? No, Father. You should go and see him and confess your temptations, the appetite that tries to blind you with pride. Off you go now. And don't forget. Speak to your spiritual advisor. Father Alves told me I should call you. It seems that all is not well with you. Tell me what your problems are then. I'm not sure, Father Fialho. Father Alves said I looked sad. Work of the Devil, my son. The Devil crossing your path and trying to tempt your flesh which is weak. Have you felt the temptation of the Devil, my son? No, Father. If I look sad, it's because I miss my village and my mother and family sometimes. - That's all? I'm also sorry that Gama was expelled. You shouldn't be. For several reasons. Gama was not a good companion. He was full of hate and God teaches us to love our neighbour. He was bad company. In any case, all our love is for God, and consecrated to His service. The rules forbid private friendships between seminarists. You ought to know this. - I know, Father. And what was your relationship with Gama? He and I went on holiday to the same region... And in the seminary, did you meet alone? We sometimes met in the corridors. - Did you touch one another? - Touch one another, how? - Did you stroke one another? - Stroke? Haven't you already confessed you liked him, that you miss him? He was my friend. He was my protector when I entered the Seminary. Your protector? He stopped the others from getting at me, when I was green... This is all very strange between two seminarists. Did you like him in the way you like a woman? Voluptuously? Sinfully? - In the way you like a woman? Yes, with desire. With the will to sin. With the flesh drawing us towards Evil, towards lascivious pleasure. Don't you feel the heat going up your legs, a wild desire, an uncontrollable desire to sin, and sin and sin?! At night, when you're alone in bed, alone with no one to see you, but only with God as a witness, wouldn't you like to have Gama beside you, to kiss him and hold him... Kiss Gama? Hold him? No, Father. I only feel like that with girls. With Carolina and once with Mariazinha... - With girls! Sinner! The Devil is guiding you. Have you already had carnal experiences with persons of the opposite sex? What are carnal experiences, Father? To sin! Allow yourself to be possessed by the Devil! To go with girls and women! To touch their secret parts, to hold and kiss them shamelessly. Have you already kissed a girl on the mouth? No, Father. Besides everything else, it's not hygienic. You have to overcome the sin within you. Pray to rid yourself of wicked thoughts. Don't put your hands in your pockets. Never lean up against others. You must look for uncomfortable positions when it's necessary. Always keep your hands outside the bedclothes. Never have them close to your body. You must occupy your mind with study and pious thoughts. Don't sleep in tight clothes, wear wide underpants. Avoid sinful meetings. The Devil tempts us. All of us. The Portuguese Empire extends into how many continents? Answer, Tavares. The Portuguese Empire is found on four continents. In Europe we have Portugal and the Archipelagos of Madeira and Azores. In Africa, Guiné, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe, Angola and Mozambique. In Asia, the State of India and Macau. In the East India, Timor. Silence. Let's start to rehearse. Carlos Pereira. Good. That's not bad. But in the good old days we had really good playing. This used to be a first class band! Faustino played the trumpet; Rebelo the clarinet. And the drum was first class too! Well, those were the good old days. Now, it's as you can see. Good afternoon. Don't you know that seminarists can't speak to the servants? There's no one here now. Don't you get me into trouble. I don't want problems. I'm here thanks to the goodness of the Fathers. The Rector gave me this job. It's always difficult for a cripple to find work. I was a seminarist here but one day in the holidays I had an accident. It happened in a mine. That ruined my life. I left the seminary. Why? That's the rule! Priests can't be cripples. I lost the opportunity but I did manage to stay on here working. Go on. Don't cause trouble for me. Go off your mates. Be seeing you. In my village there's a girl called Dulce who teaches catechism and who's pretty. We used to go to catechism just to see her. One day I walked between her and the wall and rubbed up against her. You're making it up! You don't believe me? Look. I've got a magazine here with half-naked women. I've never shown them to anyone, but I'll show them to you. - I don't want to see them! I'm an old hand at this kind of thing. They keep me company every night. Don't you want to see? I don't think you believe me. Here, look. I've even been with a real woman, not just a photo... You're lying. Big mouth! - Look for yourself! - I don't want to! All right, I'll tell you everything. The woman I was with is this one. The one that's just got a scrap of tiger skin covering her. Leave it. António dos Santos Lopes, two steps forward. Have you got your ribbon there? - Yes, Father. Do you know why you won it? Yes, Father. The green ribbon means that I had more than 13 for behaviour in the first year. Put it on! Father Thomas, please. Two steps back. All of you go to class now! But I didn't do anything, Father Alves. I didn't even touch the magazine. That has been taken into consideration, as well as your age. If not you would have been expelled like Peres. But it's not fair! I didn't want the magazine! All will be forgotten. Learn a lesson from it and let time do the rest. Everyone will forget about it. What did Father Alves say to you? That I should be content! That it will all be forgotten! - You'll see it will... - No, Gaudêncio. I want to leave here. Even if it kills me! Don't go yet. Wait another year. No, Gaudêncio, I'm leaving. I've been here almost two years. I can't stand it any longer! Listen... In a year... Don't tell anyone, but in a year, I'll leave with you... António Santos Lopes. Come here. Do you know why you are going to be punished? Yes, I know, Father Thomas. Confess your fault aloud, so that everyone can hear. I hit Taborda. And why did you hit Taborda? Answer! Because he called me a fan. Taborda, come here. I didn't say nothing, and he hit me. - He's lying, Father Thomas. - Apologise! I'm sorry, Father Thomas. On your knees! On your knees, did you hear me? I'm sorry. Get up! Hold out your hand. The other one! Go and sit down. António, you rascal, I thought you'd never get here! How are things at the seminary? Come along, boy. It is time to go to the table. António, when are you going to say mass? Isn't Dr. Albedo here? I haven't seen him yet. Excuse me. Well, on holiday already? How were your marks this term? What's for dinner today? Something you like. See if you can guess. What kind of soup is this? Carolina, take this away! - But you must eat, son. - No. Take it away. Well then, your marks? Pass me the wine. What kind of wine is this? Carolina, bring that other wine. It's the kind you like... Are you going to tell us the marks, or not? I had 13 in Latin, 12 in Portuguese... 13 in Latin! Fine. So you must know a lot about it. You already know "rosa, rosae, dominus, domini", and much more. More or less. Fine, fine. Mother, that door, please. I can't sit in a draught... Carolina! Why did you leave the door open? So, 13 in Latin. Fine. Mariazinha, pass me the bread. Yes, Sir, 13 in Latin. You don't have lessons in correct manners in the seminary, do you? Oh yes, Madam. I even had 14 in manners. One day Father Raposo questioned me and I knew everything. How to cut duck, how to write sympathy letters, how to distinguish a wine glass from a water glass... I was told in the seminary one taught you so that you could get on in all social classes. But... Listen. Since you had 13 in Latin, you must know this. Tell me, what case does the verb "utor" take? The verb "utor", I don't know. It takes the ablative. You don't know anything... You don't even know what case the verb "utor" takes. It will be a long time until you can say mass... Mother... I don't want to go back to the seminary. What are you saying? I don't want to go back to the seminary! - Why not? - I don't want to! What do you know about life? All my life I've been a half starved work horse. If you were a priest I could have a comfortable old age, and your brothers would have some support I never thought about these things, but it seems I may have to one day. Now what am I going to do? I guessed as much! No, the mother of a priest. It was too good to be true! To be able to eat aged cheese in the winter! To mix with rich religious ladies! That couldn't be for me. Not for my old bones! But you need the vocation. What does that mean? Don't talk to me in Latin, I don't understand! I can't be a priest! I want to be a man! I want to have a woman! Go and find one! I didn't manage this time either. My mother... Ah, but I'll escape, António. When I'm bigger, if my mother won't let me leave, I'll escape. I've got an uncle in Lisbon and he said to me: "You can come to my house whenever you want". He really likes us. One of my sisters is there almost all the time. Have you really, truly never thought: "What if God doesn't exist?" How can you say such a thing? Well, I've also had the same though. - But you actually said it! - Don't be afraid. I didn't say that God didn't exist. I only said: "What if God doesn't exist?" There's no harm in that. How many are missing? - Ten! - That many? The flu is attacking in force this year. - What's wrong with you? - I'm cold. Go to the infirmary so that they can see what's wrong with you. You too. Go and have your temperature taken. Father Thomas. I feel ill too. - How do you feel? - Cold. Shivers and dizziness... Go as well. - I managed to get off too... - But do you feel ill? Not really. But I'll have a few days holiday. No lessons and no prayers. And I can stay beside you in the infirmary. - What do you want here? - Father Thomas sent us to the infirmary. There's no room here. Go and lie down in your dormitory. Someone will come and see what's wrong with you. - What's going on? - Were going home. The rector's sent all those who aren't sick home. Only those who are sick are staying. Seems it's an epidemic. - And me? - You stay here until you're better. Gaudêncio! - Hello, António. Well? - I'm better. I wish I hadn't said I was sick. And you? My head's aching and I'm awfully cold. - Is that better? - Yes, much better. You haven't got a temperature at all. Get up. If you've nothing better to do then come and help. Father Alves! How's Gaudêncio? Is he very bad? Silence because of the sick! Is he dead? He is already before the Lord. Be quiet, my son. Silence. Love of discipline, love and respect for his superiors, the living faith that always stirred him, made him a model seminarist, an example to all his colleagues. The unfathomable designs of God did not allow him to attain the sacred dignity of the priesthood, which was his most ardent dream. Gaudêncio is today at the feet of God. We ask him to intercede on our behalf, and we will try... "Don't tell anyone, but in a year I'll leave with you". We are sure that the best way of paying homage to this memory is to carry out our duty strictly, as he carried out his. His deepest desire was to prepare himself with dignity for the priesthood and to find an equal fervour in all his colleagues. Let us fulfill his desires by renewing our own pious intentions and by intensifying our faith and our love of God. What's wrong child? Nothing, mother. Are you still sad? There's nothing wrong with me, mother! My poor boy! My poor boy! Always so sad. How hard it is to live! Sometimes I think about what I've suffered since I was born. And about what your father suffered. And about what the poor suffer. Are you going already? - Are you angry for what I said? - No, mother. Today it's Doctor Alberto's birthday. There's a party with fireworks. They want me to be there earlier. Off you go then. And forget about what a silly old woman says. Mariazinha, come here. Don't play with fire. Don't set off the rockets, you may burn yourself! Leave them to António! Be careful, António! Turn the fuse the other way. - Lend me your cigarette, please. - You can keep it. "Priests can't be cripples. That's the rule". António! Mother... Now that I have one hand less, they won't want me at the Seminary... What have you done my child! You didn't have to go so far.
