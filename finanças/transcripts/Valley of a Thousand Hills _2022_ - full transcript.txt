Ouch! It is every parents wish for their daughter to arrive to this day… a day when they come of age. Great ancestors. Here's your daughter, Nosipho. Today is a big day, it's her coming of age ceremony. Please be with her as she starts her journey into womanhood. My girl, this is your gift for good behavior. I trust that our ancestors will be with you on this journey of finding a husband. Great ancestors! My mom passed away -when I was 12 years old Her passing devastated my father. My father is also a headman of our village. He commands respect. He is a shrewd man feared by everyone… but deep down inside, he's gentle. He is my father and I love him. Well done, there's still hope for our girls in this village. What a beautiful ceremony it was. The event was so nice. Gentlemen, it was a pleasure. I have to take my leave now. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Keep well. - Thank you. Thank you so much If I had known that I'd be arriving on your birthday… I would have brought you a great gift. Where have you been? We haven’t seen you for ages. Happy birthday. Thank you very much. You have grown. You've grown into such a beautiful woman. I see that you've bought a machine. Of course. Don't you want to go for a spin? I'm sure your parents want a lift back home. Oh my goodness. Hello, Thenjiwe. I didn't see you there. I enjoyed watching you dance in the field. - When did you learn to dance like that? - Hey, Mr Casanova. Enough with the compliments already. - Please leave us. - What's with you? - Are you now her spokesperson? - Oh, stop it. - Bye-bye. Go. - I'll see you. Stop it. Mr Casanova? He's such a nuisance. Can we go now? Now? Or don't you want your gift? But… Take this. Please take it inside. Gosh. We'll be back before he knows it. Let's go. Tell me… does your brother always have to come in a new car? Vika is a Lieutenant now… and he wants everyone to see that he has money. He left the village how long ago? More than three years, I guess? Yes. Five years now. But he is such a show off. He's an attention seeker. And he's not married yet? Come on. Vika, my brother getting married? -Say you’re joking. That's the day pigs will fly. It would rain cats and dogs. - Come on. - That will never happen. Serious. Gosh. Why are we even talking about my boring brother anyway? Because he's as boring as his sister. - I'm boring? - Yes, you are. Why are we here? Look there? An unfinished house, Thenjiwe? -Come. Hang on… I thought I’d be done before your birthday, but… it came too quick. What do you think? This is your gift. So all this time you've been disappearing, you've been busy with this house? And you thought I was cheating on you. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. You were mad at me. It has always been your wish for us to have a place of our own… far from the world… by the river. - But I didn’t think… - I’d do it? Yes. Uh-uh. No. This is crazy. What will people say? What will they say? You mean your father? Nosipho, your father has given you the dagger… and you’re now free from all his rules. Can't you see? This is what you've always wanted. I'm not prepared for us to hide forever. This will send my father to an early grave. You can't let your father - control your entire life. - My father is nothing like yours. You're an adult now. You must make your own decisions. You're about to start work at a school soon. You're not dependent on your father. This is your house too. It's great to see a new face around here. I hope you will continue to stay even after your internship ends. Let me show you to your classroom. You know… things haven't changed much. I can't believe that I'll work at a school where I first met Thenjiwe. Your name? Please give me your number. Just your number, baby. - Hey stop that nonsense. What's with you? - Geez! Are you alright? I'm looking for Grade ten B. Let me take you. Don’t mind those boys. They're crazy. But I will take care of you now. They will never mess with you again. Hey! Settle down and listen. This is Ms Mpanza. She's the new student teacher. She'll be taking this class for the rest of the year. So, I hope… you will treat her well. Okay? Yes, sir! Thank you. Good morning, class. Good morning, Miss. My name is Ms Mpanza. What happened here, dad? They must have broken the fence while fighting or escaping. Let me try. Ok. I have got it. No man! I need to buy new wire mesh when I get paid. Now listen my child… we have to find a way to mend it today. You know your mother, she'll freak out… if she finds out we let these goats escape. Don’t worry dad, they won't go out. They're conditioned to think that they're trapped in there. - Let me have my cup. - There you go. I will try again later. Yes. Yah. Gosh… Are you on your way already? As you can see, my bags are packed. I thought you’d stay a while. Why are you leaving so quickly? No way. Your father and I under the same roof? No way. I love my peace. I don't want to be stripped of my freedom. Are you saying I'm in prison? Listen, enough about prison talk. I have a question. Who was the boy you and Thenjiwe went to yesterday? What boy? Don’t deny it. I saw you and Thenjiwe sneaking out. And now? Your father asked for you. And you know who covered for you? I did. That's why you're my favorite aunt in the whole world. Listen. You don’t have any other aunt besides this one. None. Let's go back to that matter. I want to know what's going on. Wait… Could it be that Thenjiwe is trying to hook you up with her brother? Aunty, didn't you say -you left your windows open back home? -Maybe you don't have a fridge anymore. Quickly go and check, Aunty. I'm watching you. You think I'm clueless like your father. - Bye, bye. - I'm too clever. I want the news. - I see you. - Bye-bye, Aunty. -I'll come back for that news. I'm watching you. You will tell me, I'll be back. You will tell me. Oh, Aunty… - Father. - Yes? Er… How about Aunty Kitty comes and stays with you? I mean, she lives alone. I'm thinking of moving closer to work. I think you will need someone to help you around the house. Nosipho. Yes father. You’re an adult now… it's time you thought about your future, about a husband. A husband? No… I don’t want a husband. I don't. You want to be like your aunt… who has no direction in life? No. No. I won't allow my reputation to be tarnished like that. I was just saying. Get out, I want to sleep. A bomb exploded in my hands. I was just thinking, Thenjiwe. Didn't you turn turn 21 few years ago? -Yes? So? I must have missed your coming of age ceremony. Son… I'm glad you’re home. Everything will run smoothly now. What is it? - Is there a problem? - No. I agree with you that Thenjiwe must have a coming of age ceremony. - Of course. - But people have started talking. Started talking? I have told dad that I don't want the ceremony. I don't see the need to waste money. Come on. Are you not worried about what people will think? That I'm not a virgin? Uh-huh. And how would you get married if you don’t do it? Ahem! I'm going to check the fence so that the goats don’t escape. Did you fix it? I am fixing it. Goats are our livelihood. Hey. Come and give me a kiss. Mr. Gumede complained that his paint wasn't delivered yesterday. That's not the only job I do. - Boys! - Yes Boss. Take that paint and load it into the van. Didn't I tell you that I have my own business now? Soon I will not be delivering for your arrogant boss. Pity, being a delivery boy suits you. Maybe you should stick to it. I sell building material. I heard you’re building a house. I could sell it to you cheap. I will be rich soon… and I will go and add cows to your father's kraal. My dad will never accept cows from an idiot like you. Please leave, I'm busy. Hey! I'm watching you. Where did you find that flower? - It's beautiful. - No, get rid of it. That thing is poisonous. - Such a beautiful flower. Poisonous? - I'm telling you. My father always told Vika and I not to go anywhere near it. You might just find yourself dead… if it finds a way into your mouth. Nosipho. - I'm just playing. - You like to play. - I was playing. - You can't play with that. You’re so boring. Argh. So boring. Come. Imagine if you died. After all the plans we have made? I would eat it as well and die with you. Oh so sweet. So, so sweet. Stop it. You though… You see up there? Where? Look up there. Do you see the moon? There's a woman inside it. She has a baby on her back… and in her hand is a hoe. And she's carrying wood on her head. Uh-huh. That's a stupid tale. There's no woman in that moon. The way you act so casual about everything. Tut. Oh no! I should be home. What? My father is waiting for me, I haven't even cooked. What? Wait. What? - Just this one thing. - What? Please think about coming and staying here with me. I built this house for you. Thenjiwe… I have to go. Bye-bye. -Father, supper is ready. What time is it? It was a hectic day at work today… that's why I was late. Get this out of here. I don’t want it. Are you still here? I said take this food. I don’t want it. You must talk to your brother. He will listen to you. Have you told your father that this will never happen? Come on, Nosipho! He can't marry you off just like that… let alone to my brother. You must tell him. But you must also talk to Vika. Sure, I will talk to Vika… but you must play your part too. Right after the house is finished, we'll move in together, right? - Right, Nosipho? - Yes. I even told my father that I don't want to get married. And what did he say? He thought that it was a joke. Nosipho, you have to tell him! I'm not ready, Thenjiwe. Things are fine the way they are between you and I. It can't stay like this forever. Something's got to give. I promise. We will come up with a better plan. Everything will be fine. You owe me for making me cook for your father. You know that he doesn't like my stew. Nosipho. I'm not ignoring what you've just said about your father. I don’t agree with what your father is planning for you. You know, Aunty… the plans I have for my life don't involve a man at all. Please talk to him, he'll listen to you. Nosipho… you know how pig-headed your father is. He never takes advice from anyone. But let's try, Aunty. Please. I beg you, please talk to him. He might just listen to you. Don’t give me that look. I will try, okay? I will try to talk to him. Goodness. -Tell me… how did you come to that decision? Are you even ready for this? Come on, Bhungane. Do not speak as if you don't know what mom is like. Vika is ready to settle down. The letter has already been sent to the Mpanza family… and they have agreed on the date. All this boy knows… is to blow money on himself… buy expensive cars… and buy alcohol because he wants to show off. The same alcohol you drink? You see those cows? They are mine. If he wants them, he must get his own. Son, the cows in this family are yours too. You have every right to use them to take a wife. Oh. A family meeting? Mmm! So, I wasn't invited? Or you didn't want me to know that you're sending cows to Nosipho's family. What does that have to do with you? Don't worry Ma, I know it has nothing to do with me. Why would it, when your favorite son is getting married? Goodness me. Tell me… what's going on between you and Ma? Ever since I got here, I can tell that you two are not getting on. What's going on? - Ma likes to control everyone. - Stop it, Thenjiwe. That can't be it. Why are you marrying Nosipho? - Huh? - It was Ma's plan, right? Come on. Nosipho's your friend. You went to the same school, you should be happy she's marrying your brother. What's the problem? There are plenty of girls here, why would you choose Nosipho? Wait, is there something I need to know about her? I'm just asking because every time I talk about Nosipho you act strangely. You've been acting weird ever since I got here. Every time I mention Nosipho you attack me. Is she dying? - Is she sick? - What? Oh, there's a man. - No. - Then tell me what it is. Don’t make me beg. Spill it. What's going on? Don't worry, there's no guy in this village who even comes close to me. They are no match to me. - You're full of yourself. - You know I'm right. You know that. Nosipho will get married into that family… and that's the end of it. My brother, this is not right. Oh! Do you want what happened to me to happen to her too? Hey! Don't compare yourself with Nosipho. You left your marriage to go galivanting in Johannesburg. Brother, you're so quick to forget. It was dad who forced me into that marriage! It's tradition! Whose tradition, brother? You always say it's tradition, but whose tradition is it? You and dad forced me into a marriage I never asked for. You married me off to that disgusting man! Hey! Hey, hey! No woman will tell me how to raise my child! You hear me? You hear me? My brother… I beg of you. Don’t do this. I beg you brother. I'm sorry. It's okay. I know how hard this is to you. What do we do now? Let's leave this place, Thenjiwe. Apparently, people in the cities live their lives as they see fit. I will be with you every day, and we can live our lives. What about your new job? It's just an internship. I can still find a new job wherever we go. Maybe after a year or so, they'd have forgotten about me and Vika… and we'll find this house waiting for us. - You know what? - Yes? Let's forget about this house. All that matters is being with you. It doesn't matter where we go. Come here. -Argh man. Thank you. Tomorrow, your family is coming home to pay lobola. I can't be there, Thenjiwe. Then it's obvious that we're leaving tonight. Yes, it has to be tonight. Are you sure about this? - Your father is sick. - I am sure, Thenjiwe. If he can marry me off… Do you see over those hills? There's a life waiting for us. But your father… - I mean... - My aunt is there. She will take care of him. She wants me to be happy. Okay then. In that case… The Durban beach is waiting for us. There's something I want us to do before we go. Your aunt is a bad example to you. As the daughter of a headman, there's a certain way you should behave. I know you read the letter from the Radebes. Father, please. He's a good man… and he comes from a respectable family. They will treat you well. Huh? What's going on here? Thenjiwe. I'm leaving, dad. So, you were not going to say anything to me or your mom? She'll be very happy. Don’t talk like that. You know it's true. Where will you go? I'm going to Durban. Bye dad. Thenjiwe. I hope one day… you'll find it in your heart to forgive me. Your daughter… Nosipho. Father. Why aren't you asleep? Is everything okay? Who cooked? It must have been your aunt because the food was so spicy. I'm sorry, should I get you something? No, don't worry, my girl. I have already taken my pills. Go to your room. It's your big day tomorrow, your groom is coming. Go and rest. - Father. - Hm? When I leave, please let Aunty Kitty come and take care of you. Nosipho. How many times must I tell you that I can't live with your aunt? I told you that I'm fine. Go to your room. Okay. - Nosipho. - Yes, Father? Sit here. If that will put you at ease, fine… I will ask your aunt to move in. But I must now put up with her terrible food. That disgusting soup she always makes… -Come on, father. Don’t be like that. Go to bed. I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else. I have raised my daughter well. She will never let you down. Oh, here comes my son-in-law. Welcome to the family. Thank you sir. - Yes. - Oh. Tell me… Your father tells me that you will be going back to Pretoria soon. Yes sir. Then the wedding must happen soon. I hear you sir. May I come in? Good afternoon. So now you just walk into my kitchen anyhow? Let's give them some space. I was with your father outside. He looks happy. He told me that everything went well. Nosipho don’t be shy around me. You and I will be married soon. Who said I was shy? It's okay to be nervous… I am too. I don’t know what you’re rambling on about. Don’t do this. Don’t act as if we're strangers. We practically grew up together. Have you ever asked yourself if I wanted to marry you? I might be in love with someone else. What's so funny? Nosipho, don't make this difficult. I have always liked you. That's news to me, I didn't know that. You know… if you and I were to have kids… they would be beautiful. - You just don’t understand. - What don’t I understand? I don’t want all this. It's my father who wants this, not me. You will enjoy being married to me. - Hello Mo? - Ma'am. I'm looking for Thenjiwe, is she here? She resigned. - Oh. - Didn't she tell you? No. Thank you. Fine. Thenji! Thenji! Thenjiwe. Thenjiwe, where are you? Tsk-tsk. I don't approve of a wife who drinks. But… how about we go to my place to finish off these drinks? Leave me alone! Or else what? Your breath stinks. Guys… watch out for this one, she will snatch your girlfriends from you. One night with me… and you will never look back. I thought you were taking me home. Let's stop by here first. And just spend some time together… and get to know each other better before we get married. Don't you want to stretch your legs a bit? No, I'm fine. I was talking to your father… - about the wedding arrangements. - Oh. Why would you talk to my father about our wedding? Who are you marrying? Your father knows what he wants… and I respect him. A lot. -Nosipho, you don't have to worry… my family loves you. A lot. Your family? What about you? There's something important I'd like us to discuss. After the wedding… I can't take you with me. You’d have to stay with my family. But… I will come and see you from time to time… unless I get sent on a faraway mission, then that will be a problem. But I promise… I will be back. I hope you don't have a problem. Wait. So, we're going to get married and after that you will leave? I want to take you with me… - but the bedrooms there... - No, don't worry. I don't have a problem, you can go. I will stay. - Uh? - Yes. I don’t have the slightest problem. This can actually work. Hang on. What are you saying? You mean to tell me this doesn't bother you one bit? - Not at all. - Wow. Thenji. Thenji. Thenjiwe. Please listen, I have something to say. I had already packed my bags, it's just that... Don’t you dare! You suggested we leave, not me. I know, but all this is not easy for me. I'm not like you. Excuse me, I have a house to build. Thenjiwe, please listen. Maybe I have a better plan. How do I believe anything that comes out of your mouth? I've been such a fool. I quit my job. I waited for you. Thinking you’d show up. While you were busy planning a wedding with my brother! Thenjiwe, would you please listen to me? My plan might just work. Vika is going back to Pretoria in a few weeks from now. Vika is my brother, I know all that. So? That means I will move into your home… marry him, he will leave then you and I will be together. This work for us, can't you see? I'm not listening to this crazy talk. Okay, I may be crazy… but it will work for us. Not me. Thenjiwe, my father is a respectable man in the community. And as his daughter I have an obligation to fulfil. You know what? Go on and please everyone else, but yourself. As for me… don't involve me in this. Thenjiwe. Thenjiwe. Thenjiwe, I need you. You know, Aunty… I know you didn't want to come and stay with dad. I'm only doing this for you and your mother. Oh Lord, may her soul rest in peace. I still maintain, Nosipho… this is the biggest mistake of your life. Don’t pull so hard, Aunty. I'm trying to knock some sense, into this senseless brain of yours. You know, Aunty… I don't think my marriage will turn out as bad as yours. That was a mess. Let me ask you a simple question… are you even in love? There you go. But this thing… this thing will work for us. It will work. Hang on. It will work for who? Don’t mind me, I was just saying. We are watching. I know I said I don't wish to be married… But this is different. Thenjiwe and I will be together forever. That I'm sure about. I am the man here that is why you are holding me. You will get hurt. You will get hurt, look where you are going. You can't tell me that. Bride, we've brought your husband. Boys I'm am your king, you do as I say. - I'm the man. - Vika, you're the man. Bride, bride! Move, move! Wow! Who is this? See how pretty she is? Can you see her? Whoa, whoa. Thank you, guys. You see now, I'm in my house. Where is my bride? Where are you my bride? My Bride? I'm the man… there is no one like me. No matter what people say. She said… Shouldn't you be with your husband? He's fast asleep. - Can I come with you? - What? To your room. What are you doing? Thenjiwe, hit me, do whatever you like. I know I'm stupid but I did all this for us. So you think sneaking around like children will help? I can't do this. These are people's lives you're messing with. Come. - How do I touch you after... - No… Vika and I haven't done anything. And… I told you, you'd be my first. - No, hey! - Goodness. Hey, come back. Hey! Another small one. Oh no. Thenjiwe. Thenjiwe, have you seen my wife? Well, this has cleared things up. What's going on here? What's going on here? Take your wife and go, I want to talk to Thenjiwe. Not before you tell me exactly… what's going on here? I'll tell you what's going on. - Nosipho and I are... - Hey, shut up! Nosipho and I are in love. We've been dating way before you came into the picture. You're lying! Oh really? Why not ask your wife? Nosipho. Nosipho. I'm married now. Mm. Really, Nosipho? Where are you going? This is all your fault. How long have I been telling you that you're demon-possessed. - Mom, I'm not demon-possessed. - You have to get exorcised. Son… Mom, why didn't you tell me about this all this time? - I was still trying to fix it. - You were trying? - I was... - You telling me, you were still trying? They fornicate in front of you and all you can say is that you were trying? Huh? Hey you. Did Thenjiwe make you do this? Is it Thenjiwe? So after all this, what will you do? Get up and go fix this with your husband… before it gets to your father. Now listen here. I won't let you disgrace this family. Are we clear? Get up and go to your husband so you can fix all this. Goodness! I don't owe your father anything. If you bleed… don't let it scare you… that happens when you sleep with a man for the first time. Now tell me… how long have you known about this? It was when we received threats against the family. They threatened to burn down our house and chase us out of here. What? Yes. You forced me into this marriage knowing very well what was going on. No, son. I didn't know that Thenjiwe had involved this child in this. In fact, Thenjiwe is demon-possessed, she's- Zodwa! Zodwa! The way Thenjiwe behaves… clearly indicates she is possessed by demons. She should be taken to traditional healers for treatment. Otherwise we're all going to be crucified because of her. So what are you waiting for? For people to attack us before you do something? My daughter's just different. You hear that? I'm regarded as crazy by this family… when I say her demons must be dealt with by traditional healers… What are you doing as a family? None of you are supporting me. Forgive me dad, but in this, - I stand with mom. - Exactly. I'll put an end to all this. Exactly. -Hey you, what are you up to? - Are you crazy, Thenjiwe? - I'm leaving. She's yours, you can have her. Hey, hey! You will not talk to me like that. Who the hell do you think you are? You don't need to worry about me. I'm done with this family anyway. Too bad… you'll always be a part of this family, whether you like it or not. You can go, just know whatever you do comes back to me. Are we clear? - Why is everything always about you? - You will go and rid yourself of demons. And what if I refuse to do it? You'll shoot me? Huh? Vika, if you paid attention you'd know that I've never liked boys. All you care about is yourself. I've made a decision to leave this family. - I will never embarrass you again. - You already have. Right now we're the laughing stock, all because of you. Thenjiwe, you will go and seek help, are we clear? - Walk. - Yes, I'm walking. You're just wasting time, I don't know why you're resisting, come. - I can walk by myself. - Walk, walk. Come. Get in. - Thenjiwe! Thenjiwe! - Hey, where are you going? - Thenjiwe! Thenjiwe! - Hey, where are you going? Ah, she's gone. We did this for Thenjiwe's own good. It will help her in the end. Don't allow her to influence you… into being like her. Unless you want to be like her. Huh? From now on, you will behave like… a married woman. - Makhosi! - Makhosi. Please wear this around your waist. Pants and shoes are not allowed in here. Please kneel so we can go inside. Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Thokoza, Gogo! Nosipho? This is not the way I raised her. My son, maybe we got worried too soon. She probably went to her friends. Let's go home, maybe she's back. - It's not your fault, sir. - Yes. My mom is right… maybe we're just worried for nothing. - Exactly. - She'll come back. Yes. Sorry for worrying you with this. Keep well. Don't say a word. Why? Are you afraid I'll ask if Nosipho left her marriage? I said, shut... -What is it? - What's happening? - Hurry, get my pills. -Oh. Hey, Nosipho… thank you for coming back. Where were you all this time? Does your father know about all this? Nosipho… I'm sorry. Our marriage shouldn't have started the way it did. It's just that I was… shocked… and angry. I hope you'll also realize why… I did what I did. We sleep on grass mats here. You will sleep on that side, and I will sleep here. You're so quiet. How long have you lived here? I've been here for eleven months now. Eleven is my favorite number. Really? Me too. You've been here for a while, hey. So when do you graduate? My family's trying to come up with the money for the ceremony. I shouldn't be here. There must be a reason why your family brought you here. What happened? Did you have unusual dreams? Or… maybe an illness you endured. Gobela is the one who will diagnose you… with the help of your ancestors. After that you'll know whether you're staying or not. Or if maybe you just need to perform a minor ritual. You don't choose to be here, your ancestors choose your path. Thenjiwe, Thenjiwe. Get dressed, Gobela wants to see you. -Makhosi. -Makhosi! -Makhosi! -Makhosi! -Makhosi! -Makhosi! -Makhosi Your spirit is heavy. My spirit refuses to connect with yours. Take your child and go home. - What? - There's nothing I can help you with. My goodness! I paid for her treatment, now you want me to take her home? What you believe about your child is not true. She has no ancestral calling, nor is she possessed by demons. Then what do you call this lifestyle of hers? The way she behaves, what do you call it? The moment I stepped inside this hut, I could sense that you're a fraud. You're a fake sangoma. You don't know what you're doing. Then you're welcome to go and consult other traditional healers. Say no more. Listen here my child… let's go. Get up and let's go. Here we are dealing with a fake sangoma. Let's go to a real sangoma, who went to initiation school… and not be made a fool of by this crook. Get up, let's go. If you don't follow me now, don't ever set your foot in my house again. We're being crooked here. She's taken all my money now she's chasing me out. Such a crook. You know… some people belittle us… Whoever it was that poisoned her mind with a belief that… if you have feelings for someone of the same gender, you are possessed. I swear on my ancestors, all of them combined. I never want to see that woman in this yard again. I don't like that woman who just walked out of that door. I don't need her here. But my girl, if you wish to continue to stay here… you may stay. Your mother has already paid for you to stay here. But like I said… I won't lie to you and say I can help you… because you haven't been bewitched, nor are you ill. You were born this way. Where have you been? I went to get some fresh air. I can see it helped. Nosipho, I want us to try again. If you would allow me. I will sleep in Thenjiwe's room tonight. And I don't hate you, Vika. I don't care about everything you've done to me, I'm fine. To answer your question… Thenjiwe didn't force me, she and I are in love. As I walk out of that gate… I will look for her so that we can fix things. -Keep well. What! Hey, please sit properly, like school children. It's time to spruce up this classroom, so pick up all these papers. Are we clear? - Yes! - Are we clear? Yes! - How are you? - Makhosi. - Fine, thanks and you? - I'm fine, thanks. Is Thenjiwe here? Yes, she's here. I'll take you to her. Please. - Okay, please follow me. - Okay. I don't live at your home anymore and I've broken up with Vika. Congratulations. Are you okay Are you happy living here? Yes, I'm great. I'm ready, let's go and build our home together. The house was a gift to you. You can keep it. Come on, Thenjiwe. What do you want me to say, Nosipho? After what we had… and what you did. You just threw it all away. Maybe my coming here wasn't a good idea. Maybe you're right. Who called you anyway? Father, I've decided to divorce Vika. I didn't want this marriage to begin with. Besides, I'm in love with someone else. We've been together for a long time. And she happens to be a woman. My happiness is with Thenjiwe. Father! Am I dreaming? Thenjiwe. Thank you… for coming back to me. Gents, load everything into the car. - It's Zenzele. - Shh… Load everything. -Ha! Look what I just walked in on. You came to steal out stuff Zenzele. Huh? Gents, this is a party but we weren't invited. Let's go before any more damage is done. - This is a bonus. - Oh, man! You want to be the only one who has fun. We'll all take turns. -Piss off, we don't take turns. Hold her tight, Make her see how you treat girls. This was not part of the plan. You're right Thenjiwe, the colour suits us. Do you see that this house is exactly what we wanted it to be? Let's go inside. Imagine if you died. After all the plans we have made? I would eat it as well and die with you. -Oh so sweet. So so sweet. -Stop it. You though… You see up there? - Where? - Look up there. Do you see the moon? Subtitle translation by: Sphesihle Nkosi
