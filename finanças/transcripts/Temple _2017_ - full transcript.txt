We are running out of time. Is everything ready? Professor Ryo? Yes. My name is Kazunori Ittoku. I will be your interpreter. Hopefully you will have something to interpret. We don't know if he can speak. Can you tell me your name please? Can you tell us your name? Do you understand me? Yes. I understand. American, I think. Hard to tell. Where am I? Where am I? You're safe now. You are safe now. Do you remember what happened to you? Do you remember what happened to you? Is this a hospital? He asks if this is a hospital. Tell him it is a type of hospital. It is like a hospital. I don't understand. We will find out... who you are. Play it. Hey. It's me, Kate. Got the new camera and it's ready to go to Japan. So, my boyfriend is flying in from San Francisco. I wish he was on my flight, but that's okay. I need to sleep on the plane anyway. And I don't know how Chris is going to react to traveling. So, Chris is one of my closest childhood friends. We went to kindergarten together. And what's cool is he speaks some Japanese, and he really needs this trip. He needs some good luck. Good mojo. He actually had a breakdown earlier this year. His brother died in a horrific accident. You know, we've been talking a lot and I... I think he's doing okay. So I'm doing my thesis on religious studies, specifically how religion changes myth and vice versa, and I want to photograph obscure Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in rural Japan. Do you recognize this woman? Do you know this woman? Where did you get this? He asked where you got this material. He asked where you got this material. What is her name? Yeah, is it nice?

I can't believe you still haven't met. Has it really been that long since I saw you? Yeah. Goes by in a blink. Well, I'm really glad you came. Me too. Nice to finally meet you. I was beginning to think you didn't exist. - You good? - - Yeah. All right. SOBA He's, uh... He's not at all like I imagined. What did you imagine? I don't know. Not him. You don't like him. Yeah, sure. Sure I do. Yeah. I like him. He seems fine. No you don't. You're just telling me what I want to hear. Like, you two have been friends for how long? I just can't believe he's never tried anything. Yeah, well, not everyone is like you. If you say so. Are you jealous? No. I'm not. Should I be jealous? 'Cause I'll be jealous. Three tickets to Oyama, please. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. So, how'd you come to learn Japanese? Always wanted to come here. Is it what you expected? So far. You know, if we had trains like this in America I would not travel any other way. You two have been friends for a long time. I've never had that kind of relationship with a woman. What are you guys talking about? You. You guys want anything from the dining car? I'm good. Thanks. Kate? She's good. So, this is our room. Feeling like a third wheel. It's only for one night. Are we looking for anything in particular, or... Babe, how about this? Exactly. FOLK TALES Wow. Come look at this temple. Chris? Can you read this? Looks like some kind of journal. It's a Kitsune. A Shapeshifter. Half woman, half fox. Do you think we could find this place? I think so. Where did you get this? Oh... How much is it? No, she's asking where we got it. Not a good book. Sorry, not for sale. - Well, she said it's not for sale, so... - Okay, I got that. Ask her how much it is, how much she wants for it. Leave now. Closed. Do you think you said something to insult her? - Kate. - What? No. No, I, I mean by accident. You know? Maybe he said the wrong word or something. No. I didn't. We'll find it online. All right? Come on. FOLK TALES Babe. Can you please explain to your viewers why you won't be joining us on this evening's adventure? Jet lag. There you have it, ladies and gentleman. Tune in next week to discover how our heroes, Chris and James, got themselves into trouble. Who is this woman? Who is this woman? That is a good question. Hello? Excuse me! FOLK TALES The book. How can I help you? Do you work here? Yes. Sometimes. Are there any grown-ups around? Yes. Me. I'm almost nine! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, I guess that counts. I would like... to buy this book. Welcome. What can I get you? A whiskey. Okay. Interesting book. Oh. I know this temple. It's high up in the mountains. My village was below. Thank you. It's unlucky place. Very unlucky. Ah. I have a friend. She's interested in temples and wants to start with this one. This was not the start. This was the end. This temple. It will make you... sick. Check please. Thank you. Sick. Do not go there. Many other temples in Japan. Can you tell me how to... get to your village? I'm, I'm sorry. How did you get this? It's a long story. Mmm, my head. Wow. Sorry I left you so early last night. Looked like you were having a great time. James said you made a friend. A friend? Oh, you know that temple inside the book? I can find it. MURAHI SHRINE Doubt you can find this place in any travel guide. Yeah. You sure that's such a good thing? Oh. Excuse me... That went well. Good afternoon! Oh. You surprised me. Excuse me. Good afternoon. Is there an inn? Um, a place to sleep? Just for one night. You might find a room at the restaurant. It's at the top of the hill. Yes. Thank you very much. Come here. Why have you come to my village? What's he say? Um, he's asking why we came here. We came to see the temple. Temple? What's he saying? That's right. Um, he's asking why we came to his village. You should go and check it out yourself. The temple called Hitoshi. When he was a boy. Hitoshi? It showed him things. Okay, okay. He's saying this guy, Hitoshi, went up to the temple and he had visions or something. Hitoshi. He came down the mountain holding his eyes. Holding his eyes. No. Like this. Okay. What is it. What is he doing? Um, I don't, I don't understand him, so... Thank you very much. Mucho arigato. What is it? Excuse me. We are looking for rooms. For the night. Please come in. I have a room. Hey, we're just going to go for a walk, okay? Yeah. How great is this place? It's perfect. See ya later? I'm bringing in blankets. Thank you very much. It gets cold at night. Yes. I have some sake. It is very good. From a nearby town. Would you like some? Yes. Follow me. Uh... may I bring my camera? Go ahead. Can you tell me about the temple? There is nothing to tell. When the quarry closed no one visited the temple anymore. I was seventeen that year. Did you say something? Ah, I need to make up your bed. What are you doing here? This is where I live. What are you doing here? We came to see your temple. I used to play at the temple when I was a kid. Would you like me to take you there? Yes. Come. Time for bed. Good evening. Are you Hitoshi? You are American. You speak English? It's been a long time. They say you are here to visit the temple. The man in the village, he said, uh... You lost your sight there... So, what's with all this... Mystery about the temple? What happened there? Some children disappeared. They had been playing in the mountain. It became night, and the children had not returned. The search party discovered a man living at the temple. He was a monk. A wanderer. They questioned him about the missing children. But his answers were not believed. So, then what happened? They killed the monk. The children were never found. Every year we burn candles, and pray that the children will return. Someone was there, I... Nobody. Enjoy the show? I'm sorry I woke you guys. We need to be back before dark. It's very important. I know. We could feel it. As we got closer it knew we were coming. We should have gone back. Who helped you find the temple? The boy, Seita. All right. Isn't that something? It's terrible. I hate it. It's just a spider, baby. Yeah, it looks like it eats birds or small children. Oh! It's so quiet up here. I was just thinking the same thing. It's cold, though. Hold up. What? Here. What? No. Honestly, I'm okay. Thanks. What do you think the monk did to those kids? I don't want to think about it. I can't tell you how many shirts of mine have mysteriously gone missing. Never to be seen again. I gotta take a leak. Yeah, you do that. Have fun! Pray. Hey. Let's go find him. James! James! Hey. Hey, where were you? I'll show you. Come on. How cool is this? It's an old mine. I bet it goes on for miles. Who's coming with me? How about on the way back down? Oh, come on. Where's that spirit of adventure? I want to find the temple first. I mean... We might not be able to find it again. We'll leave something on the path to mark it. Fine. Fine. You sure, babe? Gift from my stepmother. Hey, look. It's the statue from the book. We found it! We must be close. Chris, what do they call her? This is a Kitsune. A Shapeshifter protects the temple. What did you find? It's getting late. My mother will wonder where I am. Can you get back by yourself? Remember to be back before dark. Bit of a letdown. Look like little graves. Maybe the monk-man made them for his victims. Was that supposed to be a joke? I know. Right? I'm sorry. I thought it was, then I said it. We should probably get out of here soon. The sun's starting to go down. We still have time. Look, I know you're not into this. - That's not true. - It isn't? Look, I just... I don't want to walk down the mountain in the dark. We do have flashlights. True. I just don't want to have to use them. Okay. Hey. I love you. I love you too. James? I thought I saw... - Saw what? - I don't know, just... You're right. It's getting dark. We should go. We can always come back tomorrow. No, I don't want to, I just... I want to find Chris and I want to go. Chris! Yeah? Chris? Grab a flashlight. Grab a flashlight. Chris! Hold it. Is he breathing? Yeah. Yeah, he's breathing. What do we do? Oh, Jesus. Thank god. Something pulled me through the floor. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. We're just going to have to wait here, make ourselves comfortable, - and go down for help in the morning. - No, I'm not spending the night here. Yeah? What do you suggest? Let's get you out of here. I'm going to take a walk. A little moonlight stroll. Care to join me? We should stay here. He's good. You're good, right? Okay. I'll be back in a few. Be careful. Yep. He's going for help first thing in the morning. Okay? He's not what I expected. He said the same thing about you. I like him. You do? Yeah. What do your parents think? Mom's undecided. Dad keeps trying to set me up with some golf pro at his club. - No ulterior motives there. I never told him. Never told him what? About his baby. So you're the only one who knows. What made you think of that right now? I don't know. There were these... little grave markers. You cold? I'm okay. Okay. - I'm going to tell him when we get back. - Tell me what? Can, can you point that somewhere else? - What was it you were going to tell me? - Nothing. I wasn't talking about you. Never mind. I think I got a pretty good idea. James. James. No, wait. What are you going to do? Where are you going? James! James! I'm going to go back to the village. Okay. You've got all the food and water - you need here in my bag. - No. I'll send someone in the morning. I told him. We're going to need some more firewood. It's okay. Why don't we just go back inside... Fine. I'll be right back. Go fuck yourself. No, please. Come on, come on! Oh... no. Flashlight died. This place isn't right. No. You gotta be kidding me. James? What's the matter? What are you doing? Kate. Wait. He needs me. Kate! Aaah! James... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Let me help you! James! Help! Help me! Please, someone help! There's no way out. Do you know why you are here? Do you know why you are here? We're trying to find a miss Thomas. Kate. We need you to tell us what happened to her. Christopher. What happened to her? Why is Seita here? He asks about someone named Seita. Ask him who is this Seita. The boy from the village. He's in the hallway. He says there is a boy from the village. And I'm not sure I understand, but he believes the boy is here. Ask again about the woman. Tell him there is no boy. There is no boy. Where is miss Thomas? We know you killed James. What happened to me, Chris? Where's Kate? James! Why did you kill your friend? Where is she? Is she still alive? He won't tell us anything. This should do it.
