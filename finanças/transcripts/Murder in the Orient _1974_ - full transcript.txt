Come over. They found her. - The girl with the map? - Yes. But we don't know if it is the treasure map. - What do you want me to do, boss? - Get the girl alive and get the map. Remember, King Cobra wants that 10 million dollars in gold. - Fair enough. I'll Jacko and a couple of the boys. - Remember, Tuco, I want that girl alive. - Hi, boss. - Lisa, you know what's out there? - No. - 10 million dollars. - Please, Martelli, help me! Quick, they're after me! (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (engine rumbling) - Sit down right there, I will be right with you.

(dramatic music) (somber music) (pleasant piano music) - You're a damn fool, Tuco! You and that hot head of yours! I told you, get the girl alive. What did you do? Kill her! - But boss. - "But boss," son of a bitch! Tuco! I was talking about the girl you killed. Not Grace! - [Grace] Is there anything else you want, Gustavo? - That will be all, Grace. - Grace, thank you. - Tuco, you're a naughty boy. - Boss, about the American. Are you going to let him get away with it? - I won't let him get away with anything! (pleasant beat music) - Goddamn. (engine rumbling) (ominous tempo music) (lively tempo music) Hiya! (woman yelping) - [Woman] Let me go. - Uh-uh, only if you promise to be good. - All right, I promise. Now, can I get up? - Just suppose you tell me who you are and what you're doing here. - My name is Monica and I'm one of Diana's seamstresses. - You know, you don't look like a seamstress. - [Monica] I don't? - [Paul] No. (glass shattering) (suspenseful bongo music) - Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Gustavo? - Hello? Yes, master. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, we'll cooperate with him. Yes, master. - They're all here, boss. - I just received a telephone call from our big boss, King Cobra. Because of your stupid mistakes, he's sending Mr. Kang over here. - You mean, Kang the Butcher? The executioner? - Yes. The big boss wants us to help Mr. Kang. His mission is to kill the brother of Diana Lao. - Why the hell does he have to send Kang over here? We can take care of our own problem! - How? The way you screwed up Diana Lao? - Oh shit. - You better listen to me! That girl might have told something to that American. Get him! And I want him alive, is that clear? (gentle guitar music) - Well, well, the lady bean bopper. - Would you believe me if I said I'm sorry? - It's a start. - I'd like you to meet my boss. - And that is the whole story, Mr. Martelli. The gold, it was looted by the Japanese General Como from the Singapore treasury and was burred somewhere near Manila and is still unrecovered. - And you say it's worth 10 million dollars. - About that much. The gold was buried under the supervision of two Japanese officers. (men shouting in Japanese) (military drumming) (gold bars clattering) (solider shouting in Japanese) (ominous music) (solider barking in Japanese) (captives groaning) (gunshots popping) (ominous music) (water splashing) (music intensifying) (soldiers yelling) - Two Japanese officers who killed everyone connected with the job. Then the map leading to the treasure was inscribed on the blade of the sword of each of the officers. Half of the map on one sword and the other half on the other sword. - So, to get the complete treasure map, you've got to get both swords. If you only have one, you only have half a map. - Right. - Whatever happened to the two officers and their swords? - Unfortunately, the two Japanese officers were killed in action during the war. And... as for the Samurai swords, one fell into the hands of the Golden Cobra Brotherhood. You've heard about them, haven't you? - Yeah. Who hasn't heard if the Asia's mafia? By the way, what happened to the other sword? - According to our information, an old fisherman up north had the possession of the map leading to the... second sword. And also according to our information, that old fisherman sold the map to Diana Lao. - Huh. That's probably why she got tagged by those Gold Cobra Hoods. Well, Colonel, you've certainly answered a lot of my questions. But now for the last one. - What is is, Mr. Martelli? - Why did you tell me all of this? Just what is it that you want from me? - Paul, Diana Lao may have told you something before she died. Would you help us in our search? - Look, I told you before, she didn't tell me anything. - [Colonel] If you are hiding something from us, let me remind you that the Golden Cobra is also after the treasure. (exciting bongo music) - Welcome to Manila, Mr. Kang. - Is everything ready for my mission? - Yes, everything is ready. Shall we go in? Mr. Kang, these are members of the brotherhood. - I trust they know why I'm here. - Yes, Mr. Kang. Would you like to have a drink? - I'd prefer to drink alone. - Grace, make us some drinks. - Gustavo, your men should not have killed Diana Lao. It's a big mistake. - [Gustavo] But I'll take care of it. - I was sent here to kill her brother Lao Tzu. - Lao Tzu? The dojo master? (men shouting) (men shouting) (men yelling) (man screaming) - Master, telephone from Manila. - I will be leaving for Manila tomorrow. Tell my friends not to meet me. Tell them and give me a full report regarding my sister's death. - To the Gold Cobra Brotherhood. - To our master, the King Cobra. - I suppose this is the sword with the map. - Yes. But it's only half of the map. That's why it was important to get Diana Lao alive. She had the clue to where the second sword is. - Are you sure that the other half of the map is inscribed on the other sword? - Yes. We must get the second sword to complete the map and the map will lead us to 10 million dollars in gold which King Cobra wants for our narcotics operation. - We'll get that sword. Tomorrow you're going to meet an American who will tell you where the sword is. - Good, I will look forward to that. Do you have a girl here named Grace Dasilva? - Yes. She's the girl who served us a moment ago. - Poor girl. I had to kill her father last week. He was to be a witness against King Cobra. - Is that so? And here she is, serving us like a slave because she thinks that her father is still our hostage in Hong Kong. (Gustavo laughing) (thugs laughing) - Grace, what's wrong? What's happened? - I hate you. I hate all of you! - Hey, kid, it's not your day. (Tuco laughing) - Tuco! Show Mr. Kang his room. Mr. Kang, your key. (pleasant saxophone music) - Well, well. What do we have here? - Paul, darling. - I don't wanna sound rude but have we met before? - Well, are you just going to sit there? I don't mind.

(traffic honking) (exciting funk music) - I wired for a reservation. My name is Lao Tzu. - Just a moment, please. Oh yes, we have it. Here, please Mr. Lao to his room. - Please follow me. Master. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you once again. - And I'm most happy to see one of my old friends again, Peter. You have the information that I want? - All the information regarding your sister's death are all here, master. - I'll study this as soon as I can. (door knocking) - Mr. Lao. May I talk to you in private? - That'll be all, Peter. Come in. Have a seat, miss. - Thank you. Here's my I.D. - Interpol? What can I do for you, Miss Martinez? - I'd like to ask you to come to our office, Mr. Lao. We have a lot of things to discuss regarding your sister's murder. - I'd be glad to, Miss Martinez. Can you give me a few minutes to freshen up? - All right, I'll wait for you in the lobby. - Mr. Lao, you're being chased by international criminals which is trying to strangle all of Asia. - Have you located their hideout yet? - No. Not yet. But we have suspects... and as soon we get enough evidence, we assure you that we'll bring your sister's killer to justice. - Your report mentions an American who was with my sister. - Paul Martelli. He tried to help your sister. - I'd like to talk to him if I may. - We have been trying to get in touch with him since last night. But he seems to have disappeared. - Disappeared? - Yes, Mr. Lao. We are afraid he might have fallen into the hands of the Golden Cobra gang. (thugs laughing) - Now, Mr. Martelli, are you ready to talk? - Go to hell. (Paul groaning) - Let me handle him, boss. I'm gonna make him talk in 10 minutes. I'm gonna make him sing like a good canary. - Not yet, Tuco. But if until tomorrow he doesn't talk, I'll give him to you. Do you hear that, Mr. Martelli? - I just hope that you don't talk until tomorrow. - You can go to hell with your boss too. - If I do, I'm gonna bring you with me. I'm gonna cut you up so good and see what's inside you. Let me go! - No, Tuco! - I'm gonna kill this son of a bitch! Let me go! - I told you, no! Gustavo, I think we better feed our guest. (ominous music) - Grace? Tuco! No! Grace, feed our guest. He must not die, at least until tomorrow. Think it over, Mr. Martelli. You have until tomorrow. Grace? Take good care of him. - You must eat and keep your strength. - Why? So Tuco can play with me again tomorrow? - You must trust me. I'm going to help you escape later tonight. But you must promise to take me with you. Is it a deal? (gentle tempo music) I'm going to set you free now but you must keep my promise. - Okay. (gentle flute music) (suspenseful music) (thug groaning) (knife swishing) (thug gagging) (suspenseful music) - [Grace] Oh no! He's a friend. - Not that way! This way. (suspenseful music) (man groaning) - What are you doing here? Where is the guard? (thug gagging) - Quick, hop in, we better get going. - [Thug] Look, everybody wake up! The American is escaping! - Quick, you better come with us. - No, take Grace with you, I'll stay here. (suspenseful music) (gentle flute music) - Hey! (exciting funk music) (Paul yelling) (glass shattering) (exciting funk music) (wood clattering) (Paul yelping) - Paul, Mr. Lao, stop it! - Monica, what're you doing here? Who's this guy? - Paul, this is Mr. Lao, Diana Lao's brother. Mr. Lao, this is Paul Martelli. - I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Martelli. (suspenseful music) - Come on, come on! Better hurry! Let's get out of this place! Come on! Hurry up! Faster! (suspenseful music) You son of a bitch! - Gustavo, this man has failed. He must be punished. - Yes. You'll be punished later. - No. He must be punished now! (sword swishing) - We raided their hideout last night but we were too late. By the time we got there, they were gone without any trace. - Just like the snakes that they are, they move silently and fast, Colonel. - You're right, Lao Tzu. Now I'm worried about Grace. - Grace settled down in my apartment. She'll stay there until we figure out what to do about her. - Did you bring the key? - Uh-huh. - This is the key I got in the envelope your sister gave me, Lao Tzu. Do you recognize it? Just before she died she told me two names, "Coral Beach", "Lao Tzu". - Coral Beach. Hmm. A month ago, Diana wrote that she was spending a weekend at a resort called Coral Beach. - [Grace] I know where Coral Beach is. It's up north and it's for members only. - [Colonel] Mm-hmm. I think you'll find whatever that key unlocks at Coral Beach. (pleasant funk music) - [Woman] Can I help you, sir? - Yes, do you have a reservation for Paul Martelli party? (woman giggling) - Boss? - Son of a bitch! Haven't you ever learned how to knock, stupid? - But boss. - [Tuco] But boss! - The American and Lao Tzu are here. They have arrived, boss. - Okay, let's go see Kang. Stupid. (Tuco knocking) The Interpol agents have arrived. - Good. I want them watched all the time. Everybody, listen to me. Our master, King Cobra, has punished Gustavo for his failures. So, from now on Tuco will be in command. Congratulation, Tuco. - Are you sure that our friend, Diana Lao, stayed at cottage number seven? - Yes, ma'am. - Is it the one under the pier? - Yes, ma'am. - Thanks. Let's go, Grace. (upbeat music) (ocean wave sloshing) I found out where Diana stayed. It's in cottage number seven. The cottage under the pier. - Cottage seven? Yeah, I remember seeing it out back. - Paul, we've got to search that cottage after the repair men leave. - You're right, Lao Tzu. We'll go there tonight after they leave. But... Since we have nothing else to do today, maybe we ought to relax? (pleasant horn music) (pleasant string music) Hey, what do you got there? - I gave this to Diana on her birthday. - Oh, wait a minute. Look at that. Hey, I think we've got something here. - Yes but I think someone beat us to whatever was in there. - Let's make sure. Here, hold this. Hey, what's this? "Pier post number five." - For success, Mr. Kang. (Tuco sighing) Like I said, Martelli and Lao Tzu are going too far and too fast for us. It is time to use this. - Not yet, Tuco. Not until we get the pressure. - Come in. - Boss, Martelli and Lao Tzu have found something and tomorrow morning they're going to the pier. - I think we better do something about this, Mr. Kang. - You're right, Tuco. Tomorrow morning, follow them with your men. - I will. (ocean waves sloshing) - I think this is the map we're looking for. - Yes. This is the map that my sister died for. - We better take this back to Monica. She probably knows where this leads to. (lively tempo music) (Paul groaning) (suspenseful music) (thug screaming) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) - Boss, they're inside. - Okay, we go in. - Boss, shouldn't we wait for Kang? - The hell with Kang! I'll handle this myself. (foreboding music) (Monica yelping) (ominous music) Ben, come on. Take her out. (sinister music) I won't hurt you, Grace. Come on, Grace. You're lovely. Wow. This is my time. (sinister music) (Grace screaming) (engine rumbling) - My god! Poor girl. (door thudding) - Monica? Monica? Lao Tzu, I think they've got Monica. Come on, we've gotta find her. (lively funk music) (tires screeching) - Here are their tracks. - Guess that old fisherman was right. They've gone into the jungle and taken Monica. (lively funk music) At least now we know where they're going. The way those guards are walking, we can't be too far from their camp. - Yes, but I suggest we wait until darkness before we make our move. (foreboding music) (thug groaning) (eerie music) - Goddamn! You son of a bitch! You let her escape! Everybody! Wake up! Wake up! Stop them! Take this stupid guy out of my sight. I'll deal with him later! - What's happening here? - That goddamn fool let the girl slip away. But I think Martelli and Lao Tzu have something to do with it. Let's follow them right away. - Be patient, Tuco. It's too dark to follow them. We'll wait until tomorrow then we'll find them, okay? - We're going to take you to the highway and drop you off. Contact Interpol and have them send help. - But what will you do? Kang and his men will surely follow you. - Don't worry about us, we're going after the treasure. - Lisa. You bring the girls back to town and wait for us there, okay? - Yes, Tuco. - Move. Raymond went away to get some more men. - I'm sure this is the place. - We should step off 10 paces from this tree to that creek. This should be the spot.

(gunshots booming) (thug yelping) (exciting funk music) (gunshots popping) (sword swishing) (Raymond groaning) (lively bongo music) (thug yelling) - Come on. - Yah! - You kick like my grandma, come on!

(Tuco yelping) - And this one's for Grace. (Tuco yelping) - No. I'm sorry. - This for all the trouble you've caused me. (Tuco yelping) - Please. I beg you. Don't kill me. - As much as I'd like to, you're not worth killing.
