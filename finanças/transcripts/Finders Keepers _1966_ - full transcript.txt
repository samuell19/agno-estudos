Wanna take her over, Air Marshal? AIR MARSHAL: No, thanks. Frankly, bores me, flying these modern crates. You can laugh. But you'll be dated too before long. Old chaps are cutting down the conventional bombers every year. Only due to the miniaturization of the bomb, sir. One plane can now do the work of six. Yeah. How many of these nasty little bombs do you carry? Twenty-five mighty mini's, sir. Each one packing a bigger punch than all the old ones put together. Terrifying. Uh, you better sit down, sir. We're running into turbulence. Call that turbulence. Hit the deck. Hit the deck. [BEEPING] Cut the rundown. We cut it, sir. Sorry about that. I say, have I dropped a clanger? No, Air Marshal. You just dropped a mighty mini somewhere over Spain. I say. # Finders keepers losers weepers # Though there are those who would disagree # Somewhere, someone's waitin' just for me # When I find her I will settle down # Keep her close and stop this runnin' 'round # Finders keepers, losers weepers # I'll find a place and I'll stay there # I'll stay there # Make my own bed and I'll lay there # I'll lay there # I'll be content every way there # Ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh # All things come to those who wait, they say # When love comes, don't let it slip away # I've been told this many times before # When at last I find her I'll make sure # Finders keepers losers weepers # Finders keepers losers weepers # Finders keepers losers weepers # I'll find a place and I'll stay there # I'll stay there # Make my own bed and I'll lay there # I'll lay there # I'll be content every way there # Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh # Finders keepers losers weepers # Finders keepers, losers weepers # [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Oh, oh. Trouble. That's the godfather. - Let's go. - Get us off. Ow! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Wait for me, lads. Wait for me. San Carlos, luv. All change! JOHN: Last one off's a chicken! [ALL SHOUTING] Another case. [IMITATING A CHICKEN CLUCKING] ALL: Ah! [ALL GROANING] Watch me head. God! [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] Where's Hank then? - Hank? - Hank? HANK: I'm over here. Ah, he's all right. CLIFF: Come on, aunty. [LAUGHING] Couldn't leave that on the train, could he? [LAUGHTER] What are you grinning at? Oh, looks like the amplifier's had it, eh? What about me, then? Oh, you didn't cost as much, did you? Ah, come on. What's your hurry? We're only a week late. Why are you always moaning? Have you ever fallen 10 feet into a bunch of nettles? I wish you'd stop raving, just for once, you know. Now, look, don't you start. Come on. We'll be here all day. Hang on. Cut that log. I wonder what San Carlos is like then. CLIFF: Oh, best summer date on the coast. They say that Bellamar is a swinging hotel. ALL: [SHOUTING] [WHISTLING] Watch it! You're not on the moon, yet, you know! Now, come on, old boy. Old lady. [CHUCKLES] [GOAT BLEATING] -Young woman. That's right. You see, in times of emergency, we must all pull together. There you are, you see? [CHUCKLES] You quite like it. [LAUGHING] - [BLEATING] - That's a good girl. - Any luck? - Depends what you mean by luck. Well, did you get any meat? - Sold out. - Fish? No, and there isn't a smell of one either. Ever since that American destroyer dropped anchor, all fishing has been banned until they find that ruddy little bomb. Uh! Thirsty. Look out, you perishing ass! That's the entire milk supply for the day. Ugh! Didn't taste very nice. Tasted of goat. Well, what did you get? Well, I've got some, some soft apples, some odd pears, some musty tomatoes and three sticks and things that look like leeks, but aren't. That means, we are faced with another of those disgusting vegetarian meals. Ooh! Correction. We were faced with one disgusting vegetarian meal. If that brute doesn't watch her step, we should have at least one good meat meal this week. And what about today, Colonel Roberts? Ah, Mrs. Bragg. I'm afraid, poor Mr. Burke has had little luck in the market again today. Today? He never does! Oh, that's hardly fair. I mean, you've only been with us two days. Yes, two days, too long. Look at the place. It's like a desert. Well, it is a trying time for all of us. But as soon as they find the bomb, our guest will come flooding back. As much as they ever do. And the town will be itself again. Meanwhile, see what you can do with this. What am I supposed to do with this? It's not fit for human consumption. I'm supposed to be a cook. Not a magician. Staff today... You know, it's a worldwide problem? Eh, if this is such a swinging place, where's all the tourists flashing in and out, then? Well, it's probably a national holiday. Anyway, it's siesta time. They're probably at kip someplace. BRIAN: Hey, there's a car coming, chaps. BRUCE: Show him your leg, John. - Hey, look, it's empty. - Stroke of luck. - Wait up a bit, then. - Oh, yeah. Go on, John, get us a lift. Here! [HORN HONKING] - Idiot! - Come back here or I'll step on you! [METAL CLINKING] Yes, what is it? A gent here wants to see you personally. Well, ask him in. Always glad to see anyone. COLONEL: Oh, huh. How do you do? - I am X. - X. Ex what? Ex-Army? X, you idiot, your contact. We speak on the telephone. But you shouldn't be here. We're not supposed to be seen together. Has something happened? Of course something has happened. What kind of secret agent are you? Blind and deaf as well as stupid. A bomb has dropped near here. - Oh, that. - Yes, that. My country wants that bomb. And you will help us get it. Oh, no. I couldn't possibly do anything like that. You are supposed to be working for us. Are you not? We paid you good money for the past five years. But you blackmailed me into it. I've never really taken to the work. And never done any work. Just copied stories from the local papers. Easy money and no harm to anyone. - Right? - Well, I... [CHUCKLES] - I, um, well... - We're not fools, Colonel. We can afford to wait. There always comes a time when people like you have their uses. That time is now, Colonel I can't possibly do what you ask. Some of my best friends are capitalists. Very well. We shall, anonymously, inform the Spanish authorities of that unfortunate incident in your past. And your present activities. You'll be in jail within two days. No! No! Just a moment. [CHUCKLES] I've been thinking it over. Yes. Yes. [CHUCKLES] What was it you wanted me to do? BRUCE: Are you sure we've come to the right place? CLIFF: Well, of course, we're at the right place. HANK: Look like a case of plague, probably. JOHN: Nah, there'd have been bodies all over the place. BRIAN: But this is ridiculous. There ought to be someone around. CLIFF: Of course, there's been a bull-fight. That's what it'll be. That's what it better be. JOHN: Hey, look, a survivor. HANK: Ooh, now she deserves to survive. Yeah. Hey, what's the Spanish for "where have you been all my life"? Buenos dias, senorita. Do you speak English? I wonder if you could spare us a little of your water. Certainly, senor. With pleasure! ALL: [GASPS] - Uh! You haven't got the chat. Now, listen, darling... [GASPS] The friendliest little tongue on the coasty said. Well, I don't get it. Well, come on. We oughta clean up before we go into a hotel. - First, you have bugs in all your bedrooms. - Bugs? Certainly not. My hotel has a reputation for hygiene. No, no, no, no. Not those bugs, you idiot! These. Oh, no. No, I couldn't possibly allow those. COLONEL: What my guests do on their holidays is entirely their own concern. Place them in all rooms. You'll find they stick almost anywhere. Scientists, technicians, may easily come to stay here while the search is on. [CRUNCHING] MR. X: Oh, and one more thing, a British agent is expected here. Try to uncover his identity and watch him carefully. Now, come on, come on. Don't you stand there. Start bugging. You will find it most enjoyable. You've got yourself into a rotten mess, haven't you? And that's a nasty looking wart you've got there. What? [POPS] Ow! Look at this lot. I always told you, you'll be no good as a spy. Well, I don't know, you know. Two hundred a year has come in very handy, as you said, yourself. It's no good kicking against the pricks. MAN ON RADIO: [WHISPERING] Caviar. Caviar! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [SHOUTS] [LAUGHING] [SHOUTING] [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] I'll give him caviar. - MAN: It's all afternoon. - You can say that again. BURKE: Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Buenos dias. Do you speak English? Mmm, mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Nuts. Same old welcome. No. I mean, I got a mouth full of nuts. Oh! Welcome to Bellamar, gentlemen. I think we can just fit you in. Oh, no, no. You booked us. - Booked us? - Yeah, booked us. Cliff Richards and the Shadows. We're to appear in your night club. - You're a week late. - HANK: No one's perfect. We're very sorry but we got stuck on a mountain. Our car pecked up. I'm afraid, that's your bad luck. You've broken your contract. - The deal's off. - Off? You don't really think you're coming around here a week late. - Do you expect to get paid? - Now look! - Look. - No! You have a look. Come on. All of you have a good look. The place is empty, deserted, no customers. It's dead. Yeah, we noticed. But why? Well, don't you read the papers? Look, I've told you. We were stuck up a mountain. An American plane has dropped a mini-bomb around here somewhere. Well, they say, there's no chance of it going off. That's why they reckon. But you know what, people heard 'em. This is the result. COLONEL: [SHOUTS] Burke! - COLONEL: On parade, Burke. - Eh, coming, yeah. You see, even if we can pay you, there'll be no one to play to. Try again next year. Well. That fills in the picture. Yeah, but what's going to fill our stomachs? Dunno. But we've got plenty of free time to find out. # Sittin' in the sun like an old tomcat # That don't know just where he's at # And I must admit to you # Right now I feel that way too # Ain't got no where # Ain't got nowhere to go # Nobody wants to know # And time drags by real slow # Sittin' on a log watch the world go by # Fat toe frog, thinkin' "My, oh, my" # Funny thing the human race # Rush here, rush there get no place. # Ain't got nowhere # Ain't got nowhere to go # Nobody wants to know # And time drags by real slow # We've come a long way # Looks like the wrong way # Now we're broke # Even a day is too long a stay # That's no joke # What a day it's been and it's gettin' worse # There must be a way to reverse # Situations such as these # If there is then tell us please # Ain't got nowhere # Ain't got nowhere to go # Nobody wants to know # And time drags by real slow # Time drags by real slow # Don't you just know that # Time drags by real # Slow slow slow # Are those them? - Yeah. - Heaven help us. [BELL CHIMES] - Mister Richards? CLIFF: Uh, yes. Oh, I'm Colonel Roberts, please forgive me, but I've only just been informed by my staff of your most welcome but tardy arrival. Well, in times of difficulty, we British must all stick together, mustn't we? I'm afraid I can't afford to pay you anything but the least I can do is to offer you accommodation. Oh, that's very kind, thank you very much. Not at all. In a few days, the situation may have become normal once more. Meanwhile, we must all... Muck in together? Thank you, Burke. Meanwhile, the hotel is at your disposal, gentlemen. Please, pick your rooms. - Thank you very much, Colonel. - Thank you. [ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] - Colonel. - Thank you. Here! Have you gone bonkers? Not at all. One of them is almost certainly the second agent we were told to keep an eyes on. Probably the one with the glasses. CLIFF: Ah, this is ridiculous. All the way to Spain and we're not allowed to swim in the sea. BRIAN: And the Americans, are gonna find the bomb. CLIFF: Anyhow, they showed us where the river was. HANK: Uh, I suppose so. CLIFF: By the way, aren't we there yet? Well, these are rushes, we must be near water. You've been saying that for the last hour. - I think it's over there. - That's your trouble. You think too much. CLIFF: How do you spell... [BLOWING RASPBERRY] JOHN: Ah, I think you've hashed it again. HANK: That's twice I've been here, the first and the last. JOHN: Well, it's not exactly Kew Gardens, is it? CLIFF: I've heard of a grass skirt but this is ridiculous. - Hang on. What's that noise? - HANK: What noise? Where? Shh! - Oh! - Whoa! - CLIFF: Look at that! - HANK: Hey! Mixed bathing! Yeah! [TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING] Come on! Where you going? You've called it, chap. You go first! Very true. [LAUGHS] # Washerwoman, # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Working in the noonday sun # Doing what you mother's done # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Menfolk busy mending nets # Children playing with their pets # If you take a look around you # At the clothes they're on the ground you # Maybe notice that they get them # Very clean # If you mention automation # They'll reply with indignation # There is just no fascination # In a washing machine # Break of day till setting sun # A woman's work is never done # Work our fingers to the bone # But you never hear us moan # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Laughing gaily all the while # You look lovely when you smile # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Washerwoman # Back before the end of day # Work is done now time for play [CHEERING AND GIGGLING] Looks like we struck oil. You're musicians! Well, what did you think we were? We thought you were engineers looking for the bomba. You mean we look like engineers? Those big boxes and wires... Remains of our amplifiers. I'm sorry. Allow me. [SHRIEKS] What's your name? - Emelia. - I'm Cliff. Oh, I have a grandmother. Her name is Emily. - I remind you of your grandmother? - Oh, no. No. I guess you local people must be having it pretty tough at the moment, huh? Yes, we only live for the summer season. Oh, well, that puts us in the same boat. See, it is the same thing for our boats. Now our fishermen aren't even allowed to go and fish. Aw, that's too bad. It's worse than bad. Tonight is the big fiesta of San Carlos. You know, when all the boats go out and blessed by the priest for the coming year. It's a terrible thing for our fishermen if the boats are not blessed. They're superstitious, you mean? You see, once before there was a great storm so the boats could not go out. And they could not be blessed. And for one year after that, there was no fish. Well, maybe they'll make an exception just for tonight. No. They forbid it. And you, what will you do? Move on, I guess. There's nobody here to entertain except a few Americans. Hey! Where do the Americans hang out? They've made a base in the old fort. They must get bored stiff. We can entertain them. They let no one through their gates. No one except me and the girls. You girls? Mm-hmm. We make the laundry for them. So we have to take it in. How'd you do that? On donkeys. You know... I have an idea that some of our problems might just come out in the wash. Hey, fellas! Come over here a minute. Whoever heard of a Trojan donkey? Shh! Shh! Shh. HANK: It would have been easier to make an appointment. CLIFF: He's a Commander, not a dentist. Shh! No talking! Hello, Emelia. How are you? Good morning, General. Now! [WHISPERING] Quickly! Come out now! You will not forget to plead for our fishermen. I won't forget. CLIFF: Okay, let's go. Oh, that guard clobbered me. GENERAL: Hey! [WHISTLES] GENERAL: Hey! GENERAL: Get him! Get him! Now go and get him! Come on! Move! [WHISTLE BLOWING] Hey you! [BLOWS WHISTLE] Hey, stop! SOLDIER 1: Go get him! Quick! SOLDIER 2: Hey you! SOLDIER 3: Stop stop! You fella, come here! Come here! [MAN SCREAMS] Help! MAN: Help! SOLDIER 1: Stop, you! SOLDIER 1: Grab him quick! SOLDIER 2: Hey, there they go! They've got the bike! [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] GENERAL: After them! MAN: Help! Help me! [YELLING] [LAUGHING] Yee haw! Hey! Hey. Come after me. SOLDIER 1: I said get off! Hey, get back here! [LAUGHING] SOLDIER 2: I got him! MAN: Help me! Where the devil did you come from? We just dropped in. Don't you know this place is off limits? Off limits? Out of bounds. Out of bounds. CLIFF: We didn't realize that did we, chaps? What are you doing here anyway? Well, we thought you must get bored stiff with nothing to do all day, and... - Nothing to do? - Nothing to do? CLIFF: Nothing to do in your spare time, of course. - We have no spare time. - No spare time. Anyway, we had the idea that maybe we could come up in the evenings do a show. We'd give you a good price. Well, that's very kind of you, son, but we have no time for relaxation. No time at all? COMMANDER: That's right. Now, if you don't mind, the gate is just down there, 'round the corner. Well, if you change your mind, ever. We won't. Goodbye. CLIFF: Oh, and one other thing, Commander. Yes. What? About this fishing ban. What about it? I don't think you realize that tonight's the feast of San Carlos. Oh, I realize it. The fishermen are very superstitious. Look. I am personally explaining the situation to the fisher folk at the Cafe Del Mar tonight. And what about San Carlos? What about San Carlos? Well, we'll just have to let Washington take care of him. Sir. [LAUGHS] Ugh! Look. I just have my orders. Okay? Okay. Sir. He's got your bike, sir. - Well, get it! - Yes, sir. Bring back the bikes! COLONEL: Right. Now let's test it. COLONEL: I'll go downstairs and see if I can hear you. You just keep walking around and talking. Er, what about? It doesn't matter! [CLEARS THROAT] Um... Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I... Rhubarb bluebarb. Rhubarb. Rhubarb. Oh. Oh! "Could all this have happened... "In so short a time? "A bare two days since she walked into my life. "Moody, magnificent... "All vibrant woman. "Built like some Grecian goddess "The passion of Cleopatra "The body of Helen Of Troy." - What are you doing? - Huh! BRAGG: Who are you talking to? BURKE: Uh... Myself. BRAGG: What about? - You. - Me? Yes. You see, ever since you walked in, strange things have been happening to me. Here. Inside. It's the water here. You better go and lie down. I... I didn't want to tell you... I... I don't... Really deserve you, I... I'm... just not worthy of you. [SNEEZES] I'm sorry, I'm allergic to roses. If only I were allergic... - to you. - Oh, for heavens' sake! Tell me, what is you Christian name? If you have one. Rona. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Rona. Ah! No! What the devil is going on here? Well I... I didn't know what else to say. It's obvious to me, Burke that no woman is safe with you. Oh-six-nine reporting in again. Safely installed without suspicion. Have me doubts about the owner of the establishment. But these can be easily resolved, as his assistant appears to have succumbed to me charms. No luck, I'm afraid. I know, I heard. You did your best. Huh. A lot of good it did us. Now I suppose you're going away. Well, actually... Something's come up. Something nice? Hmm. Something very nice. [WHISTLES] # There's a song I know # This is how it goes # There is nothing in it # complicated # Take the melody # Simple as can be # There is nothing in it # that can date it # There's no language problem in it # Children everywhere # can sing it # Swing it # La la la la la # La la la la la # La la la la la la # La la la la # La la la la la # La la la la la # La la la la la la # La la la la # There's no language problem in it # Children everywhere # can sing it # Swing it # See I've told you so # But now I must go # Leaving you with something # to remember # Now be on your way # What else can I say? # There is really nothing to it # All you have to do is do it # All you have to sing is # La la la # La la la # Sing la la la # La la la # Sing la la # La la la la la HANK: You can be arrested for doing that, you know? [LAUGHS] Something's gone wrong. Good news for a change. We've been asked to play at the cafe tonight. - For money? - No, all the wine we can drink. And all the food we can eat. They were knocked out with what we tried to do for them I know we didn't do anything. But they were knocked out just the same. Yeah, well, let's not arugue, I'm starving! - See you later? - In cafe? Hmm. They've just come in. Psst! They've just come in! Oh! Come on! Come On! Let's get back in. It's all being going on out there. The trouble with you is you're obsessed with sex. That's why you never rose from the ranks. You know, I may install this thing permanently. X could be right. Might be quite an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. MAN: Something's bound to turn up, there's always a body hanging around somewhere. WOMAN: I'm not particular? Could be stabbed, strangled, riddled with bullets mutilated beyond recognition. MAN: You're quite right, until we find a body... WOMAN: We've nothing to investigate. - MAN: We're defunct. - Who's he talking to? This is Emma Peel.. You've got the wrong wavelength. Those fishermen are really choked up if they're getting out tonight. Well, you can't blame 'em, can you? It's a living, isn't it? Biggest night of the year! What if the destroyer was out of the way for just a few hours? Well, there's no chance of that. Well, could be lured away, couldn't it? What, with mermaids? Ha ha. They're not looking for mermaids, twit. - What are they looking for? - The bomb. Correct! Shut the door. - I've got it. - Got what? CLIFF: I found it! I found the bomb! HANK: Round of applause for Cliff, lads. [CLAPS] CLIFF: Hold on a minute, listen to what I have to say. - HANK: Alright, then, where is it? - CLIFF: Well, its... Oh! Do go away, Mrs. Bragg. What do you want? What's for dinner? There's nothing in the larder. Not even a carrot! Well, I don't know, I'm not very hungry. Never mind about dinner. Take the evening off. Mrs. Bragg, I'm thinking! Blast the woman! CLIFF: Let's hope tonight t he fishermen get the biggest catch of the season. JOHN: That'll shake 'em off. BRUCE: See you later. I'm gonna have a bath, eh. Now we don't know where it is. Somewhere in the bay. And the fishermen will yank it out tonight. That's what they said. We must watch them. We mustn't let them out of our sight! # There's no use in taking # My advice for making # Love unless you're moving # My way # Things aren't as bad as they seem # What you need to daydream # Baby, keep on moving my way # My way is to kiss away # The tears that sometimes fall # His way is to cover up # The writing on the wall # I've been waiting for you # ever since I saw you # Baby, won't you try it my way # My way is to kiss away # the tears that sometimes fall # His way is to cover up # the writing on the wall # You don't need a reason # Just come to me pleasin # We'll find satisfaction in my way # - Got the hamburger? - Yes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [COMMANDER CLEARS THROAT] Friends. And I hope I can call you that. An explanation of certain actions is due to you... - One hamburger. - One note. COMMANDER: ...which has temporarily suspended the fishing. The destroyer anchored off your coast is there to function in a dual capacity. You sure they'll believe it? If that doesn't shift the destroyer, nothing will. COMMANDER: ...is there to protect you, and to ensure that none... - How do I look? COMMANDER: - ...of your fishing boats leaves harbor. Very convincing. COMMANDER: And lastly, I am now permitted to give a description of the bomb. COMMANDER: It is less than three feet long. Cylindrical in shape. It is about 12 inches in diameter. It is bright yellow in color. And it has on its side, the inscription, "Mini... "B-mark-one." Thank you for your courteous attention. That went well. Sure did, sir. You're an idiot. Compliments of the patron. You eat it. I hate to say this, sir, but I don't care for hamburgers. Look. I've got more of these than you've got. If I say eat it, eat it. # I sailed away from this old shore # Told you I'd be back no more # I was going to Malaya and Siam # Many places have I been # Many people have I seen # But my heart has led me home and here I am # Oh senorita who's the man # Beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays a small guitar # Senorita don't you listen # to his love songs # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar # I promise no more will I roam # Now my heart has found its home # And no more will I explore the seven seas # Tropic islands in the sun # Coconuts by the ton # But there's just one place that I can be at ease # Oh senorita who's the man # Beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays his small guitar # Senorita, don't you listen # to his love songs # Curling upwards like the smoke... Chew it! Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Not so much horse, sir, tastes more like blotting paper. I can't help that! Eat it! And smile! Public relations are bad enough without you making them worse. Another note. And another hamburger. # Why don't you send your friend away # I can recommend a stay # in a country where they'd love to hear his songs # I got a feeling he'd go well # in a Siamese hotel # Serenading lovely ladies in sarong # Oh senorita who's the man # Beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays his small guitar # Senorita don't you listen # to his love songs # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar # Oh senorita Who's the man # beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays his small guitar # Senorita... Senorita! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SNEEZES] # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar # Buzz off! Is it ready? Just finished. # Oh senorita # Who's the man beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays his small guitar The demon drink. Let that be a lesson to you, Burke. # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar MAN: # I met a girl from Mandalay # And she tempted me to stay # Saying darling let your anchor chain unwind # Then her husband wandered by Bring some mustard. # I ran so fast, I left my leg behind. [LAUGHTER] # Oh senorita # Who's the man beneath your window Senor. The patronhas seen your most generous sacrifice. He sends one other hamburger. He said be sure to take mustard with it this time. You will find it much to your taste. # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar #Oh... Eat it. Don't eat it. Sir? There's a note in that hamburger. A note-burger. And now... Did you see that? Oh! You better go and investigate. Why don't you go and investigate? I said you go and investigate! # Think she'd enjoy a cruise around the bay # When a force nine gale arose # And it knocked her off her toes... Very well then. We'll go together. # Oh senorita # Who's the man beneath your window # Singing softly while he plays his small guitar Didn't they say they found the bomb, sir? Here, read it yourself. # Oh # Curling upwards like the smoke from his cigar Ah! Ah! # Who's the man beneath your window Colonel. Speak to me. Colonel? That was a deliberate, cold-blooded attempt to wipe me out. Oh, don't be silly. It was just some old Spanish woman who took a swing at someone and hit you by mistake. Don't be such a fool, Burke. I know a karate blow when I feel one. I'm lucky to be alive. And I intend to stay alive. I didn't become a spy for this sort of thing to happen. I'm going to retire. - They won't let you retire. - Oh! Take a horse to water, you can't make him drink. What's that supposed to mean? Simply, that in future I shall have nothing to report. They can whistle. As far as I'm concerned, nothing of what occurred this afternoon shall I impart to them. It's no good poking me. I shall be hanged if I tell them anything. You'll be hanged if you don't, Colonel [CHUCKLES] - How lovely to see you! - You were saying? I was saying they found the bomb in the bay and they are fishing it out this evening. Hmm. Good news. And I have some for you. My country would pay 10,000 pounds to anybody who gets the bomb into our hands. Oh, good! Then all you have to do is to find a couple of good skin divers. I've got them already. [CHUCKLES] HANK: Hey, she's moving. Let's have a look. Definitely underway. No way, she's nearly out of sight, you twit. Give us that lamp will you, John? - What is it with you, Hank? - Who on earth made those specs? I can see just as well as you can. - Could have fooled me. - I did. Oh, stop raving, will ya? EMELIA: There's the signal. Oh, yeah. The destroyer must be on the move. Let's go. MAN: My friends! The miracle we have been praying for has happened. The warship has completely disappeared. ALL: Hurray! EMELIA: Magnifico! EMELIA: And then tomorrow we tell them it is some other place... CLIFF: Oh, no. CLIFF: This is strictly a one-night stand for San Carlos, remember? After this, we leave them to get on with their jobs. EMELIA: We do? CLIFF: We do. Alright. Let it go here. EMELIA: Anyway, I still think it is wonderful what you are doing for our fishermen. CLIFF: You know, I really wasn't very interested in the fishermen. EMELIA: Why'd you do this, then? CLIFF: Because you asked me to. And if you'd been an old lady in a shawl, I probably wouldn't have raised a finger to help you. EMELIA: Well, I still think you're wonderful. [ECHOING] Wonderful... Well... Seems as though somebody up there agrees. Personally, I think they're crazy! [ECHOING] Crazy... No, No, wonderful! [ECHOING] Wonderful. [THIS DAYPLAYING] # Then you came # into my world # And in my world # You'll stay # You girl # could have been such an ordinary girl # Could have been just an undiscovered pearl # Then love came with its magic # And made you # My world # I know I will always treasure # That first moment of pleasure # When me met # If I wouldn't live forever # That's one thing I would never # Quite forget # Your kiss # Could have been just an ordinary kiss # Could have been something I would never miss # But that would # Never be so # Not when I feel # Like this # If I wouldn't live forever # That's one thing I would never # Quite forget # This day # could have been such an ordinary day # Could have gone in an uneventful way # Then you came # into my world # And in my world # you'll stay We'd better go back and work on the navy. Follow me, senor. This way. It is down here. Down there. - COMMANDER: Switch the lamp. - Yes sir. COMMANDER: Not at me you idiots! Back there! - COMMANDER: Switch off the motor! - SOLDIER: Yes, sir. COMMANDER: Here, captain... SOLDIER 2: I don't see any, sir. COMMANDER: Try out there. MAN: Out there. MAN: Ah, I can't see a thing. COMMANDER: Nothing? COMMANDER: Ease her back a bit. SOLDIER: Yes, sir. Coming up. COMMANDER: Use the paddle! Use the paddle... SOLIDER: Where? MAN: There! It looks like it, sir. MAN: Got it sir, she's coming up. Steady men. Easy does it. MAN: There she is! It's the right color, sir! And shape! Hey look! There! We got it, sir! We found the bomb! Will you put that thing back there! Feels kind of light to me. Steady men. Easy does it. That ain't no bomb, sir. That's a... - That's just some old tank! - Ugh! Let it go. Now where's that floor-pushing waiter? Well, I'm blessed. Is there no privacy in these waters? Take your hands off me now. Keep that filleting knife away from me. Mind out for my flipper, you fool. It's hired. Take your fishy hands off. CLIFF: Doesn't your grandmother get lonely up here? No, why should she? EMELIA: Look out! Well, I hope your grandmother is friendlier than that. She is, come and see for yourself. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Cliff, this is my grandmother. Speak a little loud, she doesn't hear too well. - How do you do? - Como estas? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Mmm. Smells good. Paella. You know what it is? Paella? Of course I do. I bet I know something about it that you don't know. - What? - Well, why it was called paella in the first place. Because that is its name. Why is rice called rice? Why am I called Emelia? Paella is called Paella. There's a legend. It was once two words. Para ella, which means 'for her'. [SPEAKING SPANISH] You're making this up. No, I'm not. Sit down. I'll tell you all about it. # There was a girl # Noble and high born # So beautiful # she had the world at her feet # Nobles and princes # And knights who were lovelorn # Would come to her # Each hoping he'd be the one # she choose to meet # Paella he said he would do it # Paella he said he would try # He said he would start # to capture her heart # For her he'd live and he'd die # There was a boy # Humble but handsome # He was the cook # Serving her father the lord # He loved her so much # If he'd king's ransom # that would have gone # Buying her gifts but not one could he afford # Fruit from the earth # Fish from the ocean # These in his hands # became a new recipe # With love he spiced it # and added devotion # When this was done named it Paella which means # For her you see # Paella he said he would do it # Paella he said he would try # He said he would start # to capture her heart # For her he'd live and he'd die # So came the day # she stood beside him # Love in her eyes # as he took hold of hand # Her father's blessing # had been given to them # So they were wed # Rich girl and poor boy # As bells rang through the land # Paella he said he would do it # Paella he said he would try # And so he would start # to capture her heart # For her he'd live and he'd die # [SPEAKING SPANISH] What'd I do? She's angry because she's run out of gas. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Allow me. She'll manage. Let's make the table. [SPEAKING SPANISH] EMELIA: And you go and get the water. [GRANDMOTHER SPEAKING SPANISH] Stop! Where did she find that? [SPEAKING SPANISH] She said the gas company left it outside. But that's the bomb. The one everyone's looking for. It must have dropped in the yard. We should go and tell the Commander. Yeah, all three of us, we better get out of the house. GRANDMA: Ha! [SPEAKING SPANISH] What's she saying now? She won't go. I know her. I'll stay. They say it is not dangerous. Well, I know they do. But don't touch it anyway, I'll be back as soon as possible. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Later. No bash-o! No bash-o? [CHUCKLES] Emelia. There I was, a raging torrent on one side of me, a yawning chasm on the other. Now, don't blame it. - What did you say? - Uh, nothing. Oh, Colonel, may I use your phone? Oh, yes, yes, of course, by all means, my boy. I just want to call the American base. BURKE: The American base. I found the bomb. You have? Where? It dropped just outside a college on top of the hill, north of town. Uh, you know, Emelia's grandmother's place. - Oh, yeah, I know that place. - You do? Good. Yeah, yeah. You know the old lady's goat's - our goat's cousin. - Oh, shut up. - Are you quite sure it's the bomb? - Positive. Oh, so sorry. [CLICKING TELEPHONE RECEIVER] CLIFF: Oh, come on. There doesn't seem to be anybody there. Oh, I forgot. All lines are down. - Since when? - Since the storm. What storm? You missed the storm? You were lucky. Oh, I better run now. Oh, come on, come on, plug it in. Plug what in? The telephone. I disconnected it! BURKE: If you think you're gonna get away with this you're in for a very nasty shock. [SCREAMING] The other socket. That was for the lights. COLONEL: Come on, come on haven't you done it yet? BURKE: Not yet. At last. Who are you ringing? I'm calling X for his instruction. But you can't do that. For 10,000 pounds, I'll walk naked down Horse Guards Parade. Come to think of it. I did once, for a fiver. Hello. Is that you, X? This is, you know who. I found, you know what. You know what! We're not scrambled, are we? You don't expect me to spell it out, do you? You do. Very well then. I found the... B for butter, O for orange, M for marmalade. B for... - Bomb. - B for bomb. Oh, you fool! You've ruined the whole thing. Hello. Get this down. Proceed to the village of San Carlos. COLONEL: Five miles through the village there's a crossroads, they'll meet us with another vehicle and transfer the, you know what. Yes, right. Uh, you won't forget to bring the reward, will you? We'd like it in cash. Ha! Come on. You don't really think you're gonna get away with this, do you? Want to bet your share here? What is my share? You're on the sliding scale. Just leave the thinking to me. Like I always do. - Precisely. - BURKE: Like when it got us both chucked out of the army. Don't mention that to me again! Ever! [BRAGG GROANING] What was that? I thought it was your stomach rumbling after all that caviar you've eaten. On second thoughts, I think we'll take your car. Why don't we take your car? To carry a bomb? No, thank you very much. COLONEL: Get in. Just dust the seat, will you? It's not the seat I'm worried about, it's the springs. [BAND PLAYING ROCK MUSIC] I found the bomb! Speak up, will you? That's very interesting. - Where did you find it? - Ah, Commander. I've been looking for you, it's in the kitchen of a cottage, just outside town. Inside the kitchen of a cottage? That sounds logical. Well, I know it must sound ridiculous... Oh, no, no, no, we, uh, we looked everywhere outside, didn't we? Well, I guess it must have... Dropped down the chimney, of course. And you want me to go with you? Well, somebody should do something about it. Oh, yes, yes, yes. But I prefer to discuss detailed plans in private. Come with me. All right. Uh, better bring your friends along too. Seems to be a place to talk. Out here, you idiot. Hey, Commander! - What's happening? - Now, hear this I don't know if you're just a bunch of troublemakers or something more sinister. - Look, sir. - I did look, sir. Do you deny, you made a fool of me yesterday? All right, that was me. - But... - I know it was you. But I don't know why, yet. But I can explain. I know you will. On board my ship, in the brig. Look, we found the bomb, this is no joke. Glad you realize that. Watch them. Don't open this door for any reason. I shall return. Come on. You can't do this to us, we are British citizens. Now hear this. Hey, watch it! Come on, we may as well sweat it out. Seriously, did you really find it? Of course I did! Can't blame him for not believing you now, can you? I don't want to blame him, it's just Emelia's in the cottage sitting on a dirty, big bomb. Unsavory looking place. Got a tuning fork? 1957. Terrible year for corks. I've got a temperature. HANK: Play us a tune on it then. I think I'll get some air. - Hey. - What's up? One very weak set of bars. - One hammer. - Equals noise. [PIANO PLAYING] Not necessarily. # What a day it's been # and it's getting worse # There must be a way # to reverse # Situation such as these. # If there is then tell us please # Anybody know # As you go # Nobody # wants to know # And time drags by real slow # Time drags by real slow # Don't you just know that time drags by real slow - Keep going. - Keep going. # What a day it's been # And now it's getting worse # There must be a way to reverse # Situations such as these # If there is then tell us please # Anybody knows # As you go to # Nobody wants # to know # Time drags by # real slow # Time drags by # real slow # Don't you just know that time drags by # Real slow Give it us a again! [PIANO PLAYING] Can't it go any faster? Yeah, it could, if you got out. [GRINDING] Come on Burke, come on. My clutch is slipping. Tend to those things before you come out. What's wrong? BRAGG: [BANGING] Help! CLIFF: Now there's something you don't often see. BRAGG: Get me out of here! Help! [BANGING] It's from the trunk, is it? JOHN: Yeah. CLIFF: Open it then. [MUFFLED YELLING] Oh! The Colonel, Burke. They're spies, murderers, they are after the bomb! - Come on. Come on. - I'll drive, get in there hurry up. BRAGG: Come on! Let's go. Come on, come on, get on with it. Ow! You just met our goat's cousin. I bet that made your teeth rattle. Well, there it is. A bit small, isn't it? Well, handle it carefully. Treat it as if it was a... - A bomb. - Exactly. Won't you give me a hand? You can manage a little thing like that on your own, - surely. - No, I can't. I am not supposed to lift things. Colonel Roberts. What are you doing here? [BURKE GROANING] Oh, you had a narrow escape. Hello, my dear. - EMELIA: Where's Cliff? - He's gone ahead. He's deputed us to collect the bomb. My goodness, how pretty you are looking. He's gonna head to where? To keep a rendezvous with the Americans. Everything's under control. - Don't worry. - I'll try not to. Oh, by the way, dear. You are to come with us in the car. Cliff insists. I will tell my grandmother, she's asleep. No, don't worry. You'll be back long before she is awake. Kidnapping too? Shut your trap. Come along, come along and try and be a little more careful this time. BURKE: Me, be careful? You're the one who dropped it. [CLOCK TICKING] Burke. This is it. Now keep calm. Put it down slowly. - Yeah. - Then run for your life. All right. What about the girl? Still thinking of women at a time like this. [SOFT THUD] [CLOCK CHIMING] Oh! Well, come along, dear. Open the door. Well, get on with it. Well, put it down. - Huh? - Now open the door. Yeah, yeah. Ow! Well done, old fellow. You see? It's just a question of teamwork. Come along, come along, get in the back. You'll be quite comfortable there. You can sit on the bomb. Get in, dear, get in. There we are. [INDISTINCT YELLING] [HORN HONKING] Get out of the way! - Get out of the way! - Come on! CLIFF: Get out of the way! Move over your old lorry! Oh, this is disastrous! Get out of the way! Move! Come on, Trigger. All right, let's go. It's gone! Emelia. Emelia! - There's no one. - Drat! They've beaten us to it. I know where they are going, come along. Follow me! Hey, uh, what's that place up ahead? EMELIA: That is San Pedro. Any chance of us stopping for a drink? Certainly not! Are you not thirsty? Much too dangerous. There'll be no one about. It's a dead-and-alive hole. [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONKING] Fiesta. What stinking luck! Buenos dias, senor. Officer, we simply have to get through. For two hours it's not possible. But isn't there some other way around the town? No. You stay. Have a good time. [SIGHS] Now are you gonna give up your idea? Certainly not. [SPEAKING SPANISH] This is our chance, come on both of you. And bring the bomb. [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Watch out! - Ah! Are you sure you are on the San Pedro road? JOHN: We are lucky to be on any road! Luck, it's a miracle. Put your brakes on! - They are on! - What! [SCREECHING TIRES] [SIGHS] Who needs brakes? [CROWD CHEERING] Well, this isn't getting us anywhere. COLONEL: That's where you are wrong, Burke. When you get to the top don't follow the column, turn to the right. But that, that means we'll be going around in circles. Precisely. - Well, why? - So that when we get to the barrier, you can crash right through. I'm not risking my life for you! COLONEL: Do you want me to drive? Oh, very well then. [HORN HONKING] He won't let us through, now what? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Si, si. Look, there's the van over there, empty. They must have gone through on foot. What? With the bomb? Well, they are not there now, are they? Yeah, well they must be somewhere, we've got to find them. Come on! [FANFARE MUSIC PLAYING] [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING] We better split up. What do we do, if we find them? Well, they've got Emelia and they may just be armed. If we can nick it without them seeing, all the better. - Right? - ALL: Right! Boo-wah! When we get to the barrier. Crash right through, don't stop for anything. I hope you realize what you are doing. - Perfectly. - I don't think you do. You can't hand over a weapon like this over to that lot. Even if they do pay you. We are not going to, my dear fellow. What? I shall deliver the bomb and collect the 10,000, right. But I thought, you just said... Then they'll load the bomb on their lorry and I shall inform the authorities, and they'll pick them up in 10 minutes. Right. You mean to say, you're gonna double cross them? It's the only decent thing I can do. Father. That's the first good idea you've had today. You see, instead of being traitors... We shall be heroes, and what's more important? Rich heroes! CLIFF: John! John, seen anything? Nothing. Well, they've got to be around here some place. Take a look up there. Can't you get around the fellow? BURKE: No, I can't. Enjoying yourself? Great fun, isn't it? You know, I think we would have won first prize. Unfortunately, we've got to make a dash for it. Hold on tight. But why? I do not understand. You don't have to understand, dear. Don't bother your pretty little head. I do not see why we cannot tell the police, and they can help us. Because I've got strict orders not to tell anybody. It would only start a panic. CLIFF: Emelia. - Cliff! - Are you all right? They're spies. - I knew there was something... - Where's the bomb? Under here. Don't get off for a moment. Come on, come on, they're moving. [GRINDING GEARS] What's the matter now? It's jammed. - What is it? - Get down, and I'll change them over. Right... [YELLING] You all right? You did your best. You'll never get away with this. As soon as we arrive, wherever you are taking us I shall go straight to the British Embassy. Calm yourself, my dear Colonel. We couldn't have risked leaving you behind. You might have been tempted to try and double cross us. He's a fine one to talk about double crossing. You will be paid your money! My country is always most grateful for success. It is only in the event of failure that they are utterly without mercy. If you are not happy here, I suggest you get out and fly around a little. Oh. Congratulations. You've done it again. One more word from you and I'll drop you. For good. Colonel, look, look! Why are you following us? I thought it might be politic to leave too. I used to be a head-waiter in Budapest. I was wondering if there was an opening at your hotel. All right, as long as it's distinctly understood that I have retired from spying. We all have. All I want now is a little peace and quiet. [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] [CHEERING] Ow! Oh! CROWD: Oh! # Hey there, you up in your room Why such a long face? # But that's because you're in the wrong place # Throw up your mantle, it would be tragic # to miss such a night full of magic # Open your eyes # Look all around you # Open them wide # What do you see # Is it the wild merry-go-round # You see then come on # Ride it it's free # Throw off your cloak and join our fiesta # It's hardly the time for siesta # Quiet is just what is who makes the quiet # Just listen the whole ride # Open your eyes look all around you # Open them wide, what do you see # Is it the wild merry-go-round # You see then come on # Ride it it's free [CROWD CHEERING] Yee-haw! The truck! Hey! Thank you! See you later! Hey!
