(sighing) (light jazz music) Sounds good. You know how long I've been waitin' to get here? - Hm-mm. - For this one moment? Let's see, about 12 1/2 hours. You know that, that makes you a pretty important person, do you know that? - Well I hope so. - As they say on the street, can you dig it? - Dug it. (growling) Missed you. (child crying) - Hey, I did hear the kids. - Oh, so did I, but they're not spoilin' my night tonight. I'll check on 'em. (sighing) - How did it go? - She was just a dumb broad. I bet you she won't yell cop again. You waited three months for the money? - Yeah, she thought she was dealin' with the corner drugstore, huh? Well, forget it. We wrap up 58th-- (snorting) We wrap up 58th Street School, that gives us every elementary school in LA. Now you add to that every high, every junior high, plus junior colleges, man, that's one hell of a take a day. - Percy, sometimes I think we oughta lay off the kids. Now, when I was 10, 11, and 12, I didn't know what a pill looked like. - Never, never! Don't ever say that again. The man's been takin' us. The man's been takin' us from the time we got here 'til the time we leave. Now you dig man, 65% of your average national network commercial time is geared to rippin' off the kid. Man, from Santa Claus to sugar-coated oatmeal. Hell man, sugar alone is more harmful to the kid than the pill. - I'm hip. - I don't feel a thing, not worth a damn I don't! - Percy, what are you mad about? We'll never land 58th Street School anyway. - You wanna bet? - Look man, we don't need it. Now, so it's gonna cost us a little to lose it. It'll cost us a hell of a lot more to win it. And I'm not talkin' about the money, I'm talkin' about our necks. - Oscar, when you sniff that junk, man I can't stand ya! I want it all! That includes 58th Street. Now I want you to tell Reggie to round up some junior high guys and rip that coach off the grounds. Now if they can't do it, we'll hire some senior high dudes to do it. And if that don't work, we'll hire the neighborhood gang to do it. Man, after takin' the biggest, toughest schools in the neighborhood, I ain't about to let some little elementary school do me in. You show me one thing that the white man passes up when it comes to money. Man, no matter how small the take, and I'll eat this whole damn room. Tell Reggie he can come. Hey man, I got an exam in the morning and so do you. You guys can split. Hey wait. Oscar, you know that girl Michelle, I want you to check her out. We may want to pay her a visit. - Irene, is there anything about that night that you can remember that you haven't told us? - Look at my face. - So you didn't see anybody at all? - I was asleep. - (sighing) All right, honey, you can go. - What the hell's goin' on here? Boy, get up here with that wheelbarrow. I gotta get this place, where in the hell did they find you mammy hoppers anyway? Listen here boy, you're handling that wheelbarrow like a teaspoon, get on with it boy! Get it filled up with some more rocks. I gotta bunch of concrete trucks getting in, go on boy! I gotta get this job done and clean it up. - Hey Mack, lighten up. He's a new man and, well I just don't wanna lose him. - Hell, he ain't gonna make it anyhow and you know it. 50 bucks say that wheelbarrow'll bite him in the butt. Do I hear any callers on my bet from you mothers? He's a goner! Come on! (upbeat 70s music) - Don't make me kill you man. (upbeat 70s music) - Look man, they thought you were somebody else, it was a mistake. Well just look at it this way, six months ago, you'd have been wiped out. Now we've come a long way from that. And from where I stand, that's real progress. You uh, you want a cup of coffee? (sighing) Was talkin' to that jailhouse psychiatrist, what's his name? (telephone ringing) Well anyway, he tells me you're gonna start things spinning for yourself real good one of these days. Is that right? Is that right? - Am I free to go? - Did you see that, not one stinkin' word. Who does he think he is? Jesus Christ! (telephone dialing) - K.D., have you thought about adoption? - Oh no, not this one, this one I hate. (Carl laughing) Think I'm joking? Of all the jailbirds assigned to me on probation, he's the only one that intimidates me. - How's that, D? - I mean all of that damn silence, he's laughing, man. I mean deep down inside he's laughing like hell. - Laughing at what? - At you, man. Me, us. After all I mean, we get paid for the little good that we do, or we think we do. - [Carl] Knock that stuff off, man. - Listen, Carl, this is serious business and we had better snap to it. - Would you do me a favor man? So far all you've been doing is talking in riddles man. What are you talking about? - Come on, Carl, don't be so stupid. What Chris is waiting on is that time factor. He's looking for the time factor, I sense it. And when it happens, well Carl, I hate to think about it because it's gonna make you and I look like public enemies-- - Now wait man, wait-- - and I'll tell you somethin', to me that's a little embarrassing. - Nobody makes me look like a public enemy, you understand, nobody! I know who I am, what I do, and how much bullcorn I take out there, you understand? Now listen to me good, you're 6-2, you weigh 195 pounds, I'm 5-11 1/2, and I weigh 170 pounds. Now you carry him on your shoulder, you understand? You carry him on your shoulder. - Listen Carl, you should-- - Now wait a minute, wait a minute, now I know that guy you're talkin' about, as far as I'm concerned, he's a two-bit punk that oughta be in one of two places, preferably jail. Number two, in some psychiatric ward in a straight jacket. Now that's the way I feel about it. - Come on, Carl, come on, you oughta be sellin' me on this guy. - Why, because he's black? - Jesus Christ. - Look here man, I thought Oscar was suppose to be here. - You forget about Oscar, Oscar's days are numbered. What I want you to do is get that lady off 58th Street School grounds. I don't care how you do it, but you get her off and get her off fast, you understand? That's what we're payin' you for. - You gotta move man. Hey look I, I could say I'm sorry and I wish the whole damn thing didn't happen. I'd have to do it anyway, I'd have to tell you, you gotta move. Neighbors are complaining, people are movin' out. I'm sorry. Hey look, no hard feelings, man. (upbeat 70s music) (engine stalling) (upbeat 70s music) - How far are you goin'? (quick, upbeat 70s music) - I like speed, what do you like? (quick, upbeat 70s music) (tires squealing) - Please, I think I want out. - Look, you asked for this ride sister, sit there and shut up. (upbeat 70s music) (tires squealing) - Man, what kind of a liar are you? - Listen, you want out, okay, jump, but-- - Now only a bully would pull a stunt like this, now I want out now and I mean it. (tires squealing) Let me out, open this door! You better open this door and let me out! (tires squealing) Let me out of this car. - [Chris] Door opens on the other side. (upbeat, funky music) (tires squealing) (upbeat, funky music) (tires squealing) - Sorry I'm late Joe, but I just couldn't get my car started. (upbeat, jazzy music) (kids talking and yelling) Oh boy, here they come. Wait a minute, wait a minute, back away, back away now come on, make room for Little Joe and me, come on, watch out, watch out. (kids talking excitedly) We couldn't get the car to start. Wait, now wait everybody, move aside now. Come on, you know how we do things around here. Let's have a little bit of order, please. (kids talking excitedly) Well we're here now, we're here, okay. Just calm down, just calm down. - [Boy] I wanna play some ball. - Got that one, okay. All right, make room, come on, how am I suppose to get in here? Watch out. Oh no, okay Joe Joe, that's enough. - [Boy] I want the bat, I want the bat. - Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Move out the way, move out the way, more out the way. (kids talking excitedly) Everybody be quiet, be quiet. Be quiet now. Now come on, make room for me to get Joe through here. Come on honey, you got that one off? - Yep. - All right. - [Boy] We didn't think you'd ever get here. - Well we're here now. (kids talking excitedly) All right, well we're here now. Just be quiet. Be quiet! Now wait, just wait a minute. Now that's not the way we do things here, is it? - [Children] No. - Okay, that's better, now wait a minute. Okay Joe, you pass 'em out. Here you go, Joe. The bat. - [Boy] Come on, go, go, go. - Now wait a minute, let Joe give it to you. - [Boy] Oh, let me have this ball. (kids talking excitedly) - Let me have the basketball, I want the basketball. - Get that. Hold on, all right. Come on, Joe. Okay go on, that's it. Some work, huh, yeah. - I go first 'cause I got the bat. - I go first 'cause I got the ball. - I go first 'cause I got the bat. - I go first 'cause I got the ball. - I go first 'cause I got the bat. - I go first 'cause I got the ball. - How you gonna play without a bat? - Easy, get a stick. - Aw man, you just wanna argue all the time but I'll let you go on up. - All right. - All right, right on. - Come on, let's go. Everybody on the bench, here's the ball. - All right, batter up. That's ball one. Strike one. (children yelling) Quiet, quiet, quiet! Now all y'all sit down. Come on, play ball. - You cheat, you cheat. You always keep playin' with me every time you was out here. - Come on Jayden, put it in there. - Ball one. (children grumbling) - Put it in there, let's go Jayden, here. Yeah, one, two, three, out. - Strike two. - Come on Jayden, put it in there, let's go, let's go. - Strike three, you're out. (children yelling) Oh be quiet, come on, next at bat. - Let's go, come on you get that, let's go. Let's go, put it over. - He's out! - I say he's safe. - I say he's out. - I say he's safe. - I say he's out. - I say he's safe. - And Little Joe says out, so man, he out. Miss O'Connell'll take the ball, man. - Strike one. (muffled) He can, he got this one, knock it off, come on. - Come on man, put it in here. I'm gonna show you how to hit this ball. Come on, put it on over here, come on. - All right, so you proved that you can take over. Now how 'bout movin' out, okay. - Not until I, Not until I knock this ball over the far fence. - Leave her alone. - Leave her alone. - [Child] Leave her alone. - I hope to hell you're satisfied.

I would beat up those bullies. They would never come on our playground again, I bet ya. - Say, I was worried about you guys. How come you didn't call the cops? - Man, you're a disgrace, and certainly no different than those other bullies. And I wish to Christ you'd quit followin' us. (light jazz music) - Mindy, who is that guy who was following us? - A nightmare. Hey, who's that you were talking to? - Just a guy called Reggie. Mindy. - Hm? - Are you ready for this? - Ready. - Our father who art in heaven. Uh, our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth-- - In earth. - In earth, as it is on heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and, and-- - Forgive us our-- - Forgive us for our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. - [Both] And lead us. - And lead us not into temptation, but-- - Deliver us. - Deliver us from evil, um-- - For thine is the kingdom. - For thine is the kingdom. - The power and the glory. - The power and the glory. - Forever-- - Forever, amen. - Outta sight.

(light jazz music) (car ignition turning over) - Thanks for the lift, Michelle. - Oh I'm just glad I was at school when you called. (upbeat 70s music) (tires squealing) - How in the hell did you ever get your driver's license? (horn honking) - [Driver] What's the matter with you, huh? - [Mindy] Drop dead! (horns honking) (driver yelling) I said drop dead! - Drop dead yourself, dammit! - May I drive my car now? I mean, is it all right with you? (horn honking) - Just take me home. (horn honking) - What's wrong with you? - [Driver] Move it out, come on, let's go! - We're not permitted to lease for less than six months. And that calls for two months rent in advance. I'm glad you understand that. There's one other item. The cleaning fee, which of course you get back when you leave, if, when you move you've left everything the way you found it. - Okay, how much is that? - $50, I usually get more but you look like a clean person. 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, just right. Uh, we don't give receipts for cleaning fees but don't worry, it's safe. Your apartment's number 12, down the hall to the left. - Okay, I'll be right back, I gotta get my clothes. - Don't worry, you got six months to get those clothes in here. 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. Uh young man, I gave you the best apartment in the building. Now if there's anything wrong, you just let me know and I'll fix it, all right. - Fine. (laughing) (upbeat 70s music) - I don't believe this. Look at this place. I thought he gave me the best place in the house. (upbeat 70s music) My stove look like somethin' from the Salvation Army. Hm, oh it never fails, they do it to us every time we turn around, it never fails. Pink walls, I'll be damned, they went, must be Alice in Fairyland or somethin'. (laughing) Look at this room, I don't believe this. Where did he come, you know, oh man, holy mackerel. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to live here but if this is the best place that he's got, I hate to see what the rest of these places look like, hm. - Well, hello there. (light jazz music) I am still your husband, right? - Roy, we've gotta get rid of that damn car of mine. - Oh Mindy, baby, that's a brand new car. Now we haven't even made the first payment yet, how the hell are we gonna get rid of it? - I don't know. - Well, is there anything left of it? - What the hell's that suppose to mean? - Well, does it still have a motor? How 'bout a fender? A rear end? A horn? A door? A rear view mirror? You flooded that carburetor again, didn't you? (laughing slightly) (telephone ringing) - Hello. Oh Michelle, hi. Yeah, I'm glad you called, listen I'm sorry about blowin' up at you in the car but, you know how it was, just one of those days. Hm? (light, jazzy music) Now wait a minute Michelle, this is your life. Now I can't make decisions for you, you're a grown woman. You've gotta decide what's important to you. All right, so you were in the play, that's a fact. You've gotta decide what's really important in your life. I mean, why did you come to college? To pursue a stage career, or was it for those things that you told me about when you first started? Have you forgotten about those? Yeah, well and another thing, you know why I haven't been down to see that damn play of yours? Because you actors are out there romanticizing the very thing that I'm out there fighting against on the playground every day. Don't you see that? Can you imagine giving marijuana and pills to 12 year olds? If you could just, just come down to the real world for a minute, Michelle. Just come down to the playground for a minute and see, see what you're doin' to the minds of those kids. Makin' heroes out of punks and dope pushers. That's right. Don't you have any conscience, I mean, don't you care what you're doin'? Yeah, okay Michelle, well listen. Until you like to get up off your behind, and find out what's really important to your life, well just don't bug me, 'cause I don't wanna hear it! (dial tone buzzing) (jack hammer buzzing) - I got me an empty truck there boy, and I want it filled up with that fill dirt, you got it? And there's just one shovel. Does that say anything to you, boy? Now I done talked to the foreman, and I done backed that damn truck right up there to the dirt. You don't even hardly have to get out of your tracks. You got it, boy? What's the matter with you boy, you sick or somethin'? Gotta hand it to you boy, you sure know how to make a shovel sing. (upbeat 70s music) - How's it goin', Joe? - You know, sometimes when we're out here havin' fun, skatin' and all, I wish I could just stand up and never sit down again, you know what I mean? We had a good time today. - We sure did. Hey, did you see Bobo when he fell down? - Yeah, I did. (both laughing) - And Joan and Morgan fell right on top of him. (sighing) Helen should be out in a minute, Little Joe. I'm late for class, I can't wait, okay? - Okay. - See you later. (light jazz music) (car engine stalling) - Maybe I can help you. (gasping) Okay, try it now. (car engine stalling) Hey listen, don't push the accelerator until it starts, okay? All right, now try it. (car engine turning over) (tires squealing) (upbeat 70s music) Hi. - Hi. - My name is Chris, what's your name? - I'm Little Joe. - [Chris] Hi. - Hi. - See you later, Little Joe. - All right. (jackhammer buzzing) - In fact, about 30 years ago I had this black friend-- - Uh, Mr. Adams, I'm pretty dirty and I need some soap and water as you can see, so if you'll excuse me. - Yeah, sure, another time, go on. - What kind of fool does he think I am? He had a black friend 30 years ago. He wouldn't know a friend if it jumped up and bit him. Hi Joe. - Hi Chris, come on in. - Okay. - I've seen you before, outside the house. - That's right, my name is Chris Townes. - Hi, I'm Helen, Little Joe's sister. - Nice to meet you. I just came here to talk to Little Joe for a minute, is that okay? - Oh, okay. - Thank you. - I'll be in the kitchen if you need me, Joe. - Okay. - Nice meeting you. You know, Joe, you could help me if you would. - How? - Well you remember the girl that picked up the girl that picks you up to take you to the playground? - You mean Michelle? - Yeah, that's her name? - Mm-hm, why do you like her? - I guess I do, kinda. - [Mother] Joe honey, who are you talking to? - Oh, mother this is Chris, Chris, this is my mother. He helped Mindy get the car started. - Oh, nice meeting you. - How do you do? - Where's Helen? - She's in the kitchen. - Oh okay, I have something to do. - Michelle huh, hm, yeah I do kinda like her. But you know somethin', she doesn't even know I'm alive. Joe, you know where she lives? - Yeah, but I ain't tellin'. Mindy doesn't like you, that's the girl who picks me up. Chances are Michelle won't like you either. You know Mindy and Michelle are best friends. - Yeah, but you remember I helped her get her car goin' for her. - Big deal. - Well I admit that the other day when, what's her name, Mindy, thumbed a ride from me, I had a bad day, that's all, and she got a little upset 'cause I was goin' too fast. I shouldn't have done it. And then when I saw her goin' to pick you up, then I really felt like a heel. That's why I've been hangin' around so much. 'Cause I wanted to apologize, that's all. But she's so hard to apologize to. - How do I know you're tellin' the truth, and not planning to do anything weird to both of them? - Okay. Look Joe, I'm on probation, not for murder or robbery, or rape or anything like that. Honest to god, Joe, I'm leveling with you. Believe me, trouble just ain't my thing, Joe. - Well, you should've said that at first. Michelle lives at 3010 West Vermont Avenue, apartment seven. (upbeat 70s music) (doorbell ringing) - Yes? - Hi, my name is Chris Townes, Miss, it is Miss, isn't it? - Michelle, Michelle Searcy. - Well Miss Searcy, you see we're conducting a survey on what people would prefer to see on television if they had anything to say about it. - Who's we? - Uh, the Panathorpine Association, Miss Searcy. And, well do you mind if I come in, it'll only take a second to-- - No I'm sorry, I can't, I have an examine in the morning at eight. - Mm. - But, maybe tomorrow around four. - Four p.m. sharp, you sure that's okay with you? - That's fine. - Thank you, Miss Searcy, then I'll be here. Four p.m. sharp. (kids talking) - All right, give me the ball. Give me the ball! - [Older Boy] Right here, right here. - Just give me the ball. Give me the ball! - [Older Boy] Come on, right here. Give me now. - [Older Boy] Throw me the ball, man. - [Older Boy] Give it to Chris. - Why won't you just listen? (Mindy yelling) Give me the ball! - [Boy With Ball] You wanna take the ball? (Mindy and boy arguing) - How long are you gonna torture us? What have we done? For Christ sake what have we done? - Nothin' baby, we're what you call people chasers. We're just out here to chase ya. - Yeah, and I know why. Never, you hear me, never! (crying) (doorbell ringing) - Hey sister, we've seen you on campus and you look like you know what's happening. - That's right, and us brothers have gotten together and put together a campus newspaper, you dig? - You see, this paper will give you the truth, the whole truth, and nothin' but the truth. - That's right, now we hear there's been some jivin' goin' on down here on this campus. - But see now if you don't know what you're lookin' for, you may not be able to pick up on it, 'cause it's subtle baby. Mr. Charlie's whole game is subtle, but, we got it all right here. - How much is it? - Now, wait a minute, baby. This ain't no ordinary campus paper, can you dig it? This paper is guaranteed to get your head straight. I mean guaranteed, baby. - That's right, and when you read it, your mind will automatically expand. - Right. - That's how heavy it is. - Right. - Really, now wait a minute-- - How much is it? - It ain't for any lightweights. - How much is it, my coffee's gettin' cold. - For you, $2. - Oh. - You're in trouble, man. Violation of your probation, you ever hear of it? - Yeah, I heard of it. What time is it? - It's jail time for you, man. - Look, I got a four o'clock appointment. - Yeah, well what about your appointment with me, why didn't you keep it? I pick up this phone man, and it's two years, Chris, two long years in jail. You broke your promise to me, man! - All right, you and your broken promise, pick up the phone! But who do I call about a broken life, can you deal with that? - You're crazy, man. - And don't tell me about football and baseball, boxing or show business with this being the 20th century, and how many of our guys have made it, when you know that 75% of them are the part of the man's menagerie, that's all! Just as play things, no more, no less! You know it, I know it, and they oughta know it! - Check in with me man, okay? By the way, where'd you get a word like menagerie? - Heard it somewhere, I guess. - Later. - You only see my face, but I took a punch to the gut that I thought would kill me. - And just what are you tryin' to prove? Those are our people over there, Mindy, and you try changin' them and they'll kill you. - Change, change what? Roy, I'm a recreation director, what am I suppose to change? - Look, you know what I mean. - I don't know what you mean. - Are you tryin' to tell me that these beatings are part of your recreational training? - You're really funny, so I get pushed around by some hoods? - That's exactly what I mean, Mindy. And tomorrow you'll say, so I got stabbed by a dropout? You're dealing with a lot of dangerous people over there. They're ignorant people, nobody's safe over there, nobody. - Oh for god sakes, Roy, this is the most educated country in the world and everybody, black and white, is afraid to go to sleep at night. It's not just over there. - Look Mindy, we've got a problem, I hope you realize that. (light jazz music) - Well what do you do when Little Joe, paralyzed from the waist down, tries to stand up and come to your defense? He fell flat on his face. And what do you suppose motivated him, education? He knows that I love him, and he was ready to die for me. Now if you think that I'm gonna let a bunch of punks destroy something as beautiful as the relationship that I have, not only with Little Joe, but all those wonderful kids, well Roy, we do have a problem.

What did I do wrong? - Mark, you were beautiful, I mean really, you've been beautiful. It's just that I've taken a long look at myself, and I realize a stage career's not what I'm after. (upbeat 70s music) - Hey man, how long is it gonna take you to get that coach off the school grounds? - She's practically gone, man. - Yeah, good, good, we're losin' a lot of money, man.

(Chris yelling) - Oh Roy, you should've seen him when he fixed, he was outta sight, really. I mean there we were, surrounded by all these bullies, and like from out of heaven there he comes and he hit one there, and kicked one this way, and they were flyin' everywhere. He saved our lives really, really. I knew you'd wanna meet him, baby. (doorbell ringing) Oh, just a minute. Michelle, hi. - Oh my god. - Mark told me you quit the show, I'm glad. Well, so much for that. I've got the most adorable man that you've got to meet. - (laughing) Take me to him in a hurry, baby. - Come on. - [Michelle] Ought-oh. (laughing) - Michelle, Chris, Chris, Miche, (Michelle and Chris laughing) don't tell me you-- - [Both] Uh-huh. - When, I mean, ho, right, oh never mind. (light jazz music) - Tell me, what happened to you that day? I waited until 4:30, you know. - Something came up at the last minute. - How'd your survey go? - Well, my survey didn't go too good I'm afraid. You see it was all make believe. - You mean uh-- - Mm-un. - Oh. (both laughing) Tell me, how did you come up with a name like, what did you call it, um, uh, what was it? - Panathopians? - Panathopians, right? (both laughing) Can you imagine $2 for a campus newspaper. (all laughing) - Yeah man, you should've seen them. Hey baby, dude, this paper's gonna actually blow your mind. (Chris, Mindy, Michelle laughing) Mr. Charlie's game is over, and I mean a right child. (Chris, Mindy, Michelle laughing) And you can get it for the giant sum of $2. Now can you dig it? (Chris, Mindy, Michelle laughing) (light jazz music) - Mindy, I just don't see what's so damn funny out there. - Well, I've listened to one sermon on the subject, why start up again? - Because if I know you, black eye, swollen face, sprained ankle, and all of you right back out there. - But I'm ready. - How can you say that, your whole body is one big fracture. - Roy, the whole world is scared, I know. But we're lettin' a few people put all of us on the run. If I felt what I was doin' was wrong, for one minute, do you know, what a truly fine person you are? And that deep down, you're just as proud of me as I am of you. Or baby I just couldn't go on. If I'm just one big fracture, why do I feel so good? (light jazz music) (doorbell ringing) (doorbell ringing) - What can I do for you, Mr. Evans? - It's about my wife. You see she's a recreational director over at the 58th Street School. There's been some gang activity over there. As a matter of fact, she was beaten up pretty badly yesterday. - Why didn't your wife report this when it happened? - That's just what doesn't figure in. You see she's got some strange idea about wanting to help people. But I'm afraid for my wife's life, man. - Mr. Evans, why don't you make her quit? - That's just it, I tried, but she won't hear any of it. - Well what do you want me to do, run her off the grounds? - Look man, my wife's life is in danger I wanna know what the hell you intend on doin' about it. - Now calm down Mr. Evans, all right? I'll look into it. - You'll look into it. Man if we were white, you wouldn't be sittin' here throwing those damn darts, - Now look-- - You'd have out a pad and a pencil-- - Now wait a minute! - And you'd take down every word I have to say. - I'm gonna forget what you said, and I'm gonna forget the tone of voice in which you said it. And I promise you I'll look into it. (door clicking shut) (knocking at door) - [Carl] Hi Kelly, is your brother Chris home? - Sure Carl, I'll go upstairs and get him. - Eh, thank you. Hi Chris, I went over to your place and you weren't there so I thought I'd stop by your mother's. I got the report on what happened over at 58th Street School and uh, I think it was a good thing you did man, and I wanna thank you. - Thanks, but I just did what I had to do. - Seems for all the years that I've known you, I've had you-- - Done me wrong and you damn well won't be the last. I want to tell you somethin'. There are moments when I feel so right, so sure that I'm right, that I feel I can take this whole damn cockeyed world and turn it right side up. And you know what I'd do with it, Carl? I'd hand it to you on a silver platter, 'cause I know what you're going through, man. You seem uptight, Carl. - Uptight, yeah I'm uptight. I'm uptight about politicians coming into our communities using them for political footballs. They talk black, but they deal in green and white. I'm tired of locking up a lot of hoods and punks that commit vicious crimes and find 'em on the street two days later. Yeah, I'm uptight. I found Oscar Peterson shot to death, nobody knows a thing. Yeah, I'm uptight. I'm uptight about hearin' us call one another nigger on television and laugh, right. And the white man watches it an he applauds. And he's sayin' well you finally woke up and you discovered who you are. I'm tired of watching a mockery made of my own people, you understand that? Yeah, I'm uptight, I'm uptight about a lot of things. But that's no fault of yours, that's my problem. Worst thing about it is there's so damn little I can do about it. (door clicking shut) - For the past two weeks you've been short $10! That comes to 20 bills, why? - I cleaned out already, I did. - Why, huh? Where's the money, punk? - [Boy] Eddie's got it! - Where's the money, huh? - [Boy] Eddie's got it! - Look, you mean to tell me you let a punk like Eddie take your money? For real man? - I promise, me and my partners, we're gonna get Eddie tomorrow. - You got 'til tomorrow. (upbeat 70s music) (light jazz music) - Helen, child, what a pleasant surprise. Turn around, let me look at you. My goodness, you're as pretty as a picture. Come on, let me fix you some coffee, come on. Oh you're beautiful. - Helen, did you make a special trip over here just to see us? - Yes, it's kinda special. - What's the matter, Helen? - I think it's something about Little Joe. - [Mr. Tindall] Sit down Helen, you can talk to us. - I don't feel like sitting if you don't mind. - All right, all right. What about Little Joe? - Yesterday he came home with bruises all over his face. - Who would wanna beat up on Little Joe? - Your son's one of them, Mr. Tindall. - Oh no, no, not, not my Reggie. - He doesn't do the beating up, he pays other boys to do it. Him and a few older people that I don't know are trying to take over 58th Street School grounds, so they can sell marijuana and pills to those little kids. The coach over there knows what they're up to, and it's makin' it hard for 'em. They're trying to make her quit. They beat her up really bad. (door clicking open) - Reggie! Come here. - Hey, Pop. - Don't you ever hey, Pop me again. - What's wrong, what'd I do? - Look at ya. What do you call it, clean? (upbeat 70s music) - Are you crazy, Pop? - I said don't call me Pop again. Have I told you, don't call me Pop again! Beatin' up those kids and pushin' 'em around, you're lower than a dog. Lie, and tell me I'm wrong! - That's the way I make my money, so what? - Pull your heat, come on. Helen came over to the house. Do you know who Helen is? Do you know who Helen is? - Yeah, I know who Helen is, so what? - You're a disgrace, get out, get out! Get out! - I wanna go up to my room and get my things. - You've got no room! Whether it's upstairs or with the birds. There've been four generations of men in this family, until you, now get out of my sight! Get out, before I kill you! (upbeat, funky music) - [Michelle] How'd you get my address? - [Chris] Promise you won't get angry? - [Michelle] Okay, I promise. - [Chris] Well I got it from Joe. But you know he gave me the third degree first. - [Michelle] Little Joe is still sitting outside. - Mom and Helen must be bakin' a cake. That's the only time they ever forget me. - Oh yeah, well that's all right, we'll do the honors. Come on. (groaning) (Chris humming) - Mom, Helen. Mom! Helen! Mom! Helen! Oh, I know where they are. - [Michelle] You do? - Sure, they went to go pick up my new suit. Oh you should see it, Michelle. I got a piece of the goods in my room on top of the dresser, would you get it for me? - Sure will. (Michelle screaming) - Oh my god! (screaming) Oh my god! (screaming) - [Chris] Oh god. (Michelle breathing heavily) (crying) - Now what are we gonna tell Little Joe? (upbeat, funky music) - What's the matter? What's the matter? What's the matter? (upbeat 70s music) - [Carl] Did you see anybody come out of this house earlier today? - No, I didn't see anybody. - [Carl] You saw nobody? Are you sure, are you absolutely sure? - I told you I didn't see anybody. - He finally fell asleep. - That's good. (doorbell ringing) - Hello, I'm Reverend Blackwell from Mount Sinai Baptist Church. Little Joe used to attend my church, may I come in? - Michelle, will you come and help me, please? - Mindy I heard what happened the other day to Little Joe's mother and sister. I thought I'd stop by to see if there's anything I can do. - There is something you can do to help, Reverend. You said you wanna know what you can do to help, right? - That's right. - Well, I'll tell you. Reverend you oughta go back to your church, and get on the telephone, call every black preacher in the country that you know. - Why? - To tell 'em to padlock their churches, to lead their congregations on a march, not on Washington, but through our streets. With signs reading thou shall not kill and brothers stop killing your brother. Reverend, you know the Bible never said it was a sin to be hungry. Or on the doors for that matter. But it does say thou shall not kill. Our neighborhoods are execution chambers. We're just killin' one another for nothin'. No wonder some people think we're animals with a gullibility for vice that's endless. Our women and kids are afraid to walk the streets. And when the sun goes down it's a nightmare. Well if we can sit in and kneel in, just to sit at a counter to drink some water, then I think the church oughta damn well lay its body down in the streets, at every intersection. 'Til our neighborhoods are safe. Now that's what you can do, Reverend, instead of leadin' your congregation in the hymn, I'm on My Way to Heaven Anyhow, let me tell you somethin'. You are not on your way to heaven anyhow. ♪ Know what you're doing to yourself ♪ ♪ Woo, woo-woo ♪ Know what you're doing to your ♪ (dramatic music) (digital music)
