Go ahead and take your clothes off Relax. That's enough. Anton Laccabue, the next time you try to run away, it'll be two hours in the sack! You can take that home that way your parents can use it as well. This place isn't for you you're a mistake, you don't deserve to exist. I don't know how to follow the rules. We've been told that you mainly have difficulty with math and that you've had to repeat the classes several times. But this doesn't mean anything. Johannes has gone out, come on. You're a total idiot! You're all sweaty. That's what happens when you aren't a good boy. You have to rest now. Each man... Has a gift he can find fulfilment in. Everyone can have a place in society. Each life has a meaning. You have to trust in that. It says here you were also hospitalised in the mental institution in Pfafers, for an examination. There's a nasty little devil who's got into your head. Right here. I know it's his fault that you always get angry. But now now I'm going to make him calm. And I'm going to get rid of him. Come out! Get out! Get out! See, he's going away. He's always hiding, then he goes over there He spends hours with the rabbits. He feeds them, talks to them He doesn't do what he's supposed to do, he doesn't obey me It's in his blood. Italians are hot-tempered. You just can't teach them. They're God's children too. You're very patient... Mum! Hey, what are you doing? Anton, be a good boy! Don't breathe in my face! You'll go to your relatives' house each month. You must behave respectfully towards all your peers Especially the younger ones and the ones with more severe handicaps. You must always obey and respect your teachers and those who take care of you. I'm counting on your goodwill. Do you have faith? Toni! Leave the girls alone! Do you remember when we went to the sanatorium? Those photographs of the people with syphilis Girls you can never know what they've got And they can give you some terrible diseases that can kill you. Your mummy loves you Enough! Don't touch me! Investigators... are still... enquiring into... the tragedy of the Italian family The father, known to be a violent drunk, has been accused of murder. But he continues to claim he is innocent. An autopsy has been done on the bodies of the three children But for now the hypothesis of poisoning has yet to be confirmed. The wife is in critical condition there is no hope for her either. In the meantime, Laccabue is still in prison... We should give him back to that Italian woman who gave birth to him. What an ungrateful God It isn't fair, you couldn't have children. And that one you just had to have is mad. We should've remained without children. Don't swear, don't swear! We should've remained without children, without God! But you're sure happy to have the money we get for taking care of him. Toni, open up No. Toni, open up! My real mum is dead? You mustn't think about what it says in the newspaper. Now, that's enough, go away, go home! Now, that's enough, go away! Where are we going? To the border. The border? The border of what? It says here you're an Italian citizen, even though you were born and grew up in Switzerland. I want to go home. He says he wants to go home. You can't go back to Switzerland! I want to go home! This guy is as much Italian as I am Swiss. Can you tell me why you were deported? Take your clothes off. So what did you do there, huh? That made them send you away. Here people are destitute. You should've stayed in Switzerland. Look who's here! Hey guys, now that the German's here you can't cough anymore. But in return, you can fart! Toni, you hungry? You like potatoes? Wait, these are eggs! He already ate an egg. Not these, though. These are for us! Have some eggs, guys. Eat up! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Come out. Right here. See, he's going away Good morning. Good morning. Sit. Eat. Beautiful Here. If you want to warm yourself up a bit. You can stay here as long as it's so cold. I have to go to Rome anyway and my mother will be staying in the house over there. I'll go get you something else. Horse. You can draw very well. Here. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I didn't see you for a few days, I was worried. Ma'am. Take this, if you need to buy something. Thanks. Ma'am. Very kind. You've got to pay the carpenter for this! Then you have to move all those rabbit cages you put in my yard. You have to take them away from the front of my house. You animal! Don't worry. I'll remind him. We'll fix them. There you go. A nice doll. Really nice. You like, huh? Now, dog. - Who wants dog? - I do. No, I do! I do. I make two. - Morning, ma'am. - Good morning, Mozzali. Is Renato home? No, he's away. He went back to Rome. I did some sketches for a sculpture and I wanted his opinion. Who's that? Mr Ligabue. A foreigner. - Clean your pants. - Leave me alone. What a beautiful woman. Where have you been? It's ages since we saw each other. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. If you want to sell it to me, I'll take it with me on the river. - Sell? - Sell. The woman is mine. She keeps me company. I won't sell her. What a good boy. Toni, are you there? Come, come. It broke. Can you fix it for me? Broke? I can't fix it. Tomorrow, I'll make another one. A bigger one. You're nice. Nice little dolly I gave him three potatoes. I don't want him, I don't want him in the house. That nasty German brings bad luck. Get him out of here for me. What harm could he be! I'm very sorry. I covered her face, because she hasn't got one anymore. It's all ruined. Beautiful! You're beautiful. You'll see, you'll find someone who loves you. You like it? You like it? You want it? It's my painting. I did it. Do you want it? What's that? It's my painting. What did you paint? A cat? Even kids can draw better than this. Toni, what does the cat say? Meow. Toni, come here. Why do you do that? You've got to stop doing that to your nose and temple. I'll clean you up. Blood flows, the evil comes out the evil spirits come out. The evil goes away. The evil has already come out. It's out. Come on. There, there. Easy. There you go. My dear my dear little doll My dear. Why? Where are you? Where are you? Why? Don't move. In the request for admission... to our hospital from the authorities of Gualtieri, it says you don't have a job. You don't have a wife. You don't pay the bachelor tax. You don't contribute in any way to the growth of fascist Italy. We're going to live in Rome. - In Rome - Yes. There's the war I know. Renato said to give you this. They're his colours. I'm very sorry, Toni. Come in. Good morning. Chiari. Good morning. Manfredi. How do you do. This one came out well too. It's a self-portrait. I finished it yesterday. Looks a bit like that Dutch painter, doesn't it? - Yes, it does. - There are other subjects too Are there? My favourites are the animals. See? This here. This is "the wild horses". See? Wild horses. It was been... A bolt of lightening made the horses go wild. Isn't it raining here over the horses? Back here, it's raining. On the horses, it isn't raining. I respect the horses. How much are they? How much are they? You like it Buy a motorcycle. A motorcycle. And where are you going to put a motorcycle? Outside here. Toni, let them give us the money. Then later you can buy yourself a motorcycle. Okay? Dear Mayor, Mr Mozzali, a sculptor and artist like me, assured me that the director of this hospital has agreed that I could be released. There is nothing left to do but arrange for me to stay in Gualtieri, and I know you are doing this. Dear Director, this administration has already notified the psychiatric institute that it is impossible to arrange for Laccabue to stay in Gualtieri as he has no relatives and would have to rely on public charity. We have already taken Mr Laccabue's requests into consideration and arranged for him to stay in an almshouse. However, his abnormal behaviour led to serious incidents, that caused him to be hospitalised once again. With each passing day, I realise that I am using up my artistic energies, which must be allowed to bear excellent fruit. Is it not a sin to waste these energies in a place where the low moral and absolute lack of space and means prevent me from using my energy? I, who could produce work worthy of being exhibited in galleries? You must know that competent people... have judged my work as original and artistic and several newspapers have spoken very highly of me. Mr Mayor, please find it in your heart and arrange for me to be even temporarily released, because I would be satisfied with very little. My deepest gratitude. Yours faithfully. Here, sign it. Toni, this is the third time. I don't want to see you back in here again. Now, you have to straighten up. Watch your step and try not to step on anyone's toes. Got it? Here you go Mozzali. Sign this where you vouch for him like the other time. Don't worry, director. This is the last time. Make sure it is. Shall we go? Thank you. Thank you. Wait, I'll give you a hand. Let me do it. Wait, wait. There, all set. Thanks. Could I invite you to look at my paintings? They're in Mozzali's studio. The guy who makes statues for the dead. Right now, I was going to eat another time. Good morning, good morning. Alessandra, come here. Hurry. Toni. You don't look well at all. Do you need some help? Go away. Go away. Don't look. Don't look at the painting. See? - That's me there. - Good. - You like it? - Yes beautiful. The way the fox is moving still isn't quite right. The lines are all crooked. Go hammer away at that marble. The houses You don't understand the first thing about painting Are you an artist? Huh? So why are you making gravestones for the cemetery? Because I've got to eat. The genius I'll take you back where I got you. No, no, no. It's a beautiful painting. That guy over there doesn't know a thing about art. You want it? I wouldn't even know where to put it. Then forget about it! You can immediately tell if a man is bad or good, immediately! And how can you tell? You can tell! Like dogs You can immediately tell if a dog wants to bite you. Right? We're all animals. All of us. And that wound there? Aren't you taking care of it? I hit myself. Doesn't it hurt? Yes, but it goes away. Nice! You like it? Want to buy it? No? Forget about it. Come see the animals of the painter Ligabue. Antonio Ligabue. Wild animals: tigers, leopards, lions. The more you have, the more you pay! Fried fish! Would you like some cotton candy? You've got to talk about your paintings. Talk about my paintings. What's there to say? You look at paintings. There's nothing to talk about. It's for the newspaper, Toni. There's nothing to talk about. What am I supposed to say? Tell him something Come and take a picture. Toni, he's not coming. Want me to take you back to Gualtieri? I've got to do an interview. Then, at this hour the shelter's already closed. Anyway, just know that the room upstairs is free. You want something to eat? I've gone up to seven days without eating. I'll eat tomorrow. I'm going in there because they need me. If you need anything, call me. Ivo! Good evening. - Am I in time for some cappelletti? - I'll have them prepare some. So Toni, I really apologise, but something came up at the newspaper. I had to write about the fight at a dance in Correggio. This here is the last one I painted. If you want to put it in the paper. Beautiful like all your paintings. Really beautiful. But I've already done the article. And the paper won't let me do another one. Already done it? - Yeah. I already wrote it. - Then forget about it! Toni. Listen to me a second I'm here for something else. There's a director from Rome. He has to make a film with people from the Po. So I told him about you And he wants to meet you. He wants to make a movie? Yes, Toni. You can be an actor, like in the movies! An actor? I'm not cut out for that at all. I'm an artist. Toni, it's really easy And they even pay you, and you need money. The cappelletti are on the table. Trust me, this is a big opportunity. Keep that in the frame too when keep that side in there too. Try to move around. Now, walk towards us, Toni. Come do that here. Good, that's it, Antonio. What's his face like, Toni? Again, again. Now we're going to do this other scene. But you have to make him feel comfortable. You'll ask him for a drawing, a painting for you, and he'll ask for a kiss in return. And then? Do I really have to kiss him? He'll do what he feels like doing. You just make him feel comfortable! Then you've got to pay me more. Would you kiss a guy like that? Come on, Raffaele! Go around the square again. Did you like making the movie? Yes, I liked it a lot. If you like, I can have my driver take you home. Thank you. Excuse me. I brought something. Good evening. I already got your room ready. Do you need anything? I brought some pastries. - Ivo? - Ivo isn't here. He had to take some furniture to Parma. Come put them in the kitchen. Hi, Toni. Pastries. Did you wash my car? Yes, I washed it well. I found a place in Mantua where there's a really nice Simca. Are you sure it's a car for a gentleman? Tomorrow, if you want sir I'll take you to Mantua. That way you can see it. We'll see. You like them? Toni, these pastries aren't very good. Where did you get them? They're delicious. Two litres. It's all rusty from the mud. The chain everything. It'll take several days to fix it. Yeah, okay. And this one here this one. Can you paint it red for me? This one here. No, Toni. It'll cost a fortune to repaint it. Look at this Astore. All I have to do is change the piston ring. And then I'd say she's ready. - This one? - That one there. Okay. Then I want this one with the piston. And that green one. And then I want the BMW too. - The BMW? - Yes. Do you know how much it costs? I'll make you ten paintings. Ten big paintings. Really big. Ten paintings. They're very beautiful We can't have a show in the gallery with these. They look like toys. Are animals the only thing you know how to make? You don't understand anything! I am a great artist! A true sculptor. Are you happy? Now, are you happy? Is it good? The food here is good. They only put that much sauce for important people, you know. Important people? Yes yes, yes. I have a firm in Reggio Emilia, and there's an empty house too that we want to set up as a studio for you. You'll have to do a lot of paintings but just for us, got it! It's next to my garage. Is it? Antonio, the documentary came out really well. And in Rome everybody is talking about you. Mazzacurati saw it too, and he told me to send you his regards. Mazzacurati And along with Mr Vigorelli, who's a very important critic, we've decided to organise an exhibition in Rome. In Rome? - An exhibition? For me? - For you. This is an excellent wine. Antonio, we're going to need at least about thirty paintings. - Think you can do that? - Of course. I'll need lots of tubes of paint. Good ones. The German ones, a good brand. We'll have to get them in Reggio. Not here in Savonazzi. All the ones they sell are dry. Antonio. We're going to buy everything you need. The paints, the canvases. And you can come here to eat every night. Then we'll come by and pay the bill. Will you buy me a gramophone too? With some records? Yes. Thanks. Thank you very much. That's how he is. He always eats alone. - In Rome? - In Rome. Good morning, Toni. Enough with the motorcycles! We can't put it in here. I've told you over and over again. I need to see it. Otherwise, someone will steal it. Aldo's here to keep an eye on it. Cover it up well. These here need to be sent to Rome. Later, you can wrap them up and go to the train station. Take this! Hello, I'm here for lunch. The director is paying for it. Yes, yes, I know, Toni, come over here. Your table's already reserved. Come over here. Sit here. What's the matter? We're out of petrol. I told you we wouldn't get to Reggio with that petrol. Petrol damn petrol! I have to get to Reggio, for the competition. - Take it off of there, come on. - What? - Take it off! - What do you mean, Toni? Come on! We don't need anybody. Do we? Toni? Yes? Come in. Here. So, the haberdashery sent this for you. Thanks. And this one here is the suit I wore to my wedding. My wife took it in so it fits you. I'm happy to give it to you. But first, you have to take a bath okay, Toni? Let's go, I already got everything ready. The tub, the soap... I just have to get some towels. I'll go get them. Shall I wait for you there? You can't help but be shaken up, convinced by Ligabue. The colour in his work... explodes in a stunning spectacle of almost primordial violence. I think Ligabue is the only one who, in a true burst of energy, is able to tap into the hidden forces of nature and create a dazzling visual representation, if I may offer this paradox. His self-portraits unearthed in the star-studded night. At first glance, his paintings may look simplistic, but I do believe that now, with the painter's magical expertise, in one single painting, Ligabue can show us the reflection of things, as well as the reflection of the conflict of creation. Toni, what are you doing here? We've been looking for you everywhere. And your shoes? What are you doing with your shoes off? - Come on, everybody's waiting for you. - They hurt. Put them on, you can't go without shoes. Come on, put them on. They're back. The artist is back. Mum? May I? Ma'am. Toni Thank you very much, ma'am. Is this okay, Mr Toni? You have to do better. - Much better! - Okay. They're on their way They're here. So, Toni, is that what you won? The eagle? No, this one here is mine. No, they gave me a gold medal. De Chirico gave it to me. A great artist. We need to start cataloguing all your paintings. Do we? Yes, we do. Good Toni. Come on, let's go have a drink. Bravo. - Well done! - Thanks. Good job. Let's go have a drink. - Let's go have a drink! - Come on, let's go. Go slow slow. Good. You're a good driver. Ivo was right. But you've got to promise to stay thin. Like you are now. Otherwise, the springs in the seat go "squeak, squeak" and my car will get ruined. Do you have a car? No, I don't have a car, Mr Toni. What about a wife? I've got a lot of those. Because there's nothing better in life that having women, Mr Toni. Women are dangerous. Right? Let's go. Come inside. What do you think? Toni, it's beautiful. But what are you going to do with it? It isn't like you can sell it. This is going to be my house. My house. All of it painted. I'm going to come and live here when I get married. I'll come and live here. Toni, but you're afraid of women. Before I was. Now, I like them. I want to get married. My woman won't have to do anything, my woman I'll bring her I'll bring her food. Anything she wants, I'll bring her. She'll be a lady. The wife of an artist. In here. A castle. Beautiful. Now what are you doing? You're cleaning your motorcycle now that it's about to rain? - Come on, let's go. - Do you have a motorcycle? No, I don't have one, okay? You need to go to work. Don't talk then! Go to hell. What does he know about motorcycles Now it looks good. Mozzali! I can't do it. The length is okay. I like it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What are they all looking at? Toni everyone's looking at you because it's July, and it's hot as hell and you're going around in an overcoat. In my life, I often had to endure the cold. And it doesn't feel hot to me at all. Get away from my car. Driver! - Get away from my car! - Leave! Get away from my car! Toni, calm down. What were they leaning on it for Tomorrow I'll make a painting for you. A nice, big one. Come on, Toni. Get in, come on. How do I look? You look good, Toni. Really good. I know I'm ugly. I can see it. But remember I'm an artist. And people remember artists over time. They make statues of them! But you're just a driver. When you die, you die. You'll just be food for worms. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Please, ma'am. Thank you. And here it's white and green. And if there wasn't the white it'd be ugly. I'd really like it if you painted my portrait, Toni. A portrait. I've got a lot of paintings to do right now for another exhibition. We'll see. Hey, Toni, how's it going? You taking the day off? You know, they want to take my three-wheeler away. I gave them an IOU, but I don't know how I'll pay it back. Without this three-wheeler, I don't know what I'll do. Damn them. Here, take it. Thank you, Toni. Thanks, Toni, thanks. You painted a fly. And the butterfly? You didn't paint the butterfly. Butterfly The butterfly is the prize I give myself when I do a painting that satisfies me. Not all the time. Toni, I'm going out for a second. Oh, yeah? Are you coming back? I'm going to get some petrol. Toni. Toni. Can you come here? What do you want? Come here a second, please. Now now I even have a new car. If you want to come and go for a ride. I've always got things to do here. How can I? Do you want to marry me? With me, you'll live like a lady. For my Cesarina, you need a lot more than a car. First, you need status. Ma'am, I've got more than status. I'm an artist! Come on, Cesarina, come in the kitchen please and help me grate the cheese Alessandro. Hey, Alessandro. Come here. This here is for you. See? A train! Thanks. You can even go to Switzerland with that. If you want. - Thanks. - You're welcome, you're welcome. - Good morning. - Good morning. This here is for you. Thank you. You shouldn't have You know, now they're even calling me in America. For my paintings. They're beautiful, just beautiful. Thanks. Now I'm even making fifty million lire. Are fifty million enough to get married? That's enough, enough of this business about getting married! How can you get married if you spend all the money you have! Take your present. Take it away. Good, Toni. I want to take communion. I'm not just some animal. First, learn not to swear. Want to try it yourself? I think you can do it with your left. Yeah? Toni, Toni! - Good morning, Mr Antonio. - Good morning, Toni. How's it going? Well? That guy sure doesn't like me. Stop it, Toni, what are you saying? He wants me to come up there But I don't want to go. I just don't! You see? You're going to have to do a statue of me too now. Come on, Toni, now we'll see You'll see, all this will pass and that arm will get better. And here, how are things here? Is the food good? The food's good. And you? Does your ass still hurt? Well, yes, I use a cream. Did you see if my motorcycles are still down there? I'll take care of it. I, Ligabue Antonio, with no fixed abode but whose costs for emergency care are borne by the municipality, hereby request to be permanently admitted to the almshouse in Gualtieri, where I am currently being hosted as I suffer from right hemiparesis from cerebrovascular disease. I am alone, poor, have no property and a pensioner with the national social security institute, pension book no. 1127454, and promise to pay the municipal administration anything over the monthly pension of 7,000 lire. I also promise to bequeath what remains of my personal belongings, my three automobiles, 12 motorcycles, my embalmed animals, a crocodile, an eagle and a heron, to this municipality, thereby liquidating any debt I may have incurred before I began to lose my cerebral function. I don't want to die! I want to keep on painting. I want to keep living! I want to live. I don't want to die. I've got to go now, Toni. So I'll leave the pastries here. I'll come see you again soon. And Cesarina? Isn't she coming? She's always got so much work to do, Toni. But she said to say hello. She did? Tell her I love her A beautiful face Nice A pretty little face. Will you give me a kiss? A kiss May I? A kiss Antonio, are you here? Oh, you are here then. Excuse me, I'm here to take a picture of the painting. It's really beautiful, Antonio. Stand over there. Next to your model. Cesarina, get up. Stand over there together. There you go. That's it. Shall we go? I WANTED TO HIDE
