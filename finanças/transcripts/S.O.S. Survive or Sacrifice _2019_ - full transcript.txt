Why is this happening? Balloons float, everybody knows that. How'd I even get here? So far out to sea. So far from my little Liz. I don't know how long I can hang on. No. I've got to get back to her. I must survive. Hey. Hey! Mm. I know, life is so hard. Oh, my gosh. Mirianthi. I told you, call me Mira. Okay, Mira. Why don't you take those perfect little buns of yours and go grab me another cold one? If I wanted to be a slave to a man, I would have stayed in the village. Oh, you're not a slave. Okay? More like I'm your knight in shining armor, right? Hm? You love me, baby? How much do you love me, Jack? Oh. More than all the money in the world. We have enough now. That's something a poor man would say. What? What? We can't do this forever. You want to go back? Give up on all of our dreams, huh, in seeing the world? Hi. Uh, hi. We called ahead. Oh, Mrs. Katherine and Elizabeth Brown from Russia? That's us. Long story, I'm from America, she's Russian. Anyway, my company booked an apartment. Yes, yes. It's all taken care of. I just need you to register. Sure. Yeah. Liz, passports. Ah. Eh. Oops. What the hell, Liz? How could you? Still got your phone, huh? I was texting my bestie. I finally made new friends. And you dragged me away from them! This is us now, unless you want to go live with Helga? Germany wasn't that bad. At least Aunt Helga treated me like an adult. No, adults don't lose passports. I'm tired, okay? Quit shaming me. Not too tired to call your loser friends. You're just pissed 'cause I've got friends. Those things you never had. Miss Brown, I can call the port. Someone will find them. And if not, Monday, the embassy's open. Relax. You're in paradise. Yeah. Mm. Really? Shut up. We have our town festival tomorrow. I'm sure your daughter will love it. - Oh, she's my sister. - She's my sister. I'll take these. Could you have room service bring us, like, a sandwich? We haven't eaten since the Aegean. Oh, I'm afraid the kitchen is closed, but maybe downstairs in the nightclub. Okay. Liz! Hi. Dr. Goldman? Sorry I missed your call and it's so late. Yeah, she's, like, really tired and... No, no, I know that could trigger another... Look, I brought all the prescriptions. I even brought them on my carry-on and... So apart from that episode, six months ago, she she's doing really good. Just a normal teenager. No, don't worry. Don't worry. I'm working on it and... Okay. Thank you so much for calling. Speak soon. Goodnight. Liz, this bag isn't gonna unpack itself. Why don't you just try a little responsibility? Mira. Hey. Ah. You waiting for someone? You left your man in the room?! No, not me. Single gal. So let's dance! Let's dance. Dance! No, no, thanks. Come on! - No, no, no, no. - You'll feel better. - No. - Please. Let's dance. Come on. All right. Oh. Hello. Andreas. Mira. Welcome. Hey. - Join us. - Hey. Hold on, hold on. Picture, picture. Is this yours? No. Champaign, please. Perfect. Yeah, you know, it's been really fun, guys, but, oh, yeah, I really have to go. No, she can't go yet. Wait, hold on. I own a hot air balloon. Maybe... - Yeah? - Wow. What do you say? An experience of a lifetime. - Yeah, I- - Come on, be my friend. Okay! Woo! To friendship! Friendship. - Friendship. - Friendship. Oh. Come on! The sun is coming up! All right, we have arrived. Where's the balloon? Can I just get just a little trust? Just a little would be nice. I just pinged my location. My sister now knows where I am. Look, it's right over there. The wind's picking up. - Nick. - Oh. Help me out? Help me out, Nick. Let's go. Come on. It's over here. Look, go tether it up. - Okay. - Ladies, shall we? Woo! Yeah, just pull on it, just a little bit. Just a little bit. All right. Shh! Hello. Why are we moving?! Don't look at me. They were tight. Tighter than a tick's tush. You didn't tie 'em to the basket, man. Dude, you never said, "Basket." There's two ends to the rope. You understand? Loss of humor. No biggie, right? What are you, stupid? Oh, my God. Oh! - Idiot, man! - Come on! Oh, my, ah! Ah! Stop it! Cut it out! Whoa, what is wrong with you?! - Stop! - Guys! What?! We have a problem. Andy, do something! Go! Go up! No, what are you, nuts?! Get this crate down now! No, Andy! Up! Land this goddamn crate now, Andreas! Shut up! Get down! Nick! Where is Nick? Get me something from the first aid kit! Don't take it out! Get me something out of the kit! Hold his arm. Ah, what are we gonna use?! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! It's okay! It's okay! I know! It's okay. It's okay. I got you. It's okay. It's okay. The burner... Oh! Help! A man! Call the cops! Police! Hey! Nick?! - Nick! - Nick! Hey! Nick! It's too high. He won't make it. - Over here! - Hang on! Hey! - Too far! - Nick! - Where are you? - Come on! No! Nick! Here I am! Nick! Here! Keep swinging! Nick, Nick! - Nick! - Nick! - Come on! - Here I am! - Nick! - Nick! Down. Down, down. Down. Come down. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. I'm right here. I'm right here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hi, this is Mira. Please leave your message after the beep. One golden rule: Target must be alone. A simple task for any normal woman, but I suppose that's one way for a woman like you to repay her man, huh? You better put that beach house in your wedding on that list for Santa. Yeah. If we get caught, there is no us. Your words, baby. Remember? Your words. Have you seen my phone? My boss is gonna kill me. Boss? You said it's yours. Your business. I just work ground crew. Just look after it for the pilot. You mean you use it to impress women! It's okay. Are you even allowed to fly it?! No. Where's Nick? Dammit! Yeah, hello? This is the one, the little American. She spent the night here, no payment, no passport, with her accomplice, her oldest sister, who abandoned her after spending all night at the club. Go on. Then she dreamt about a man with a knife, breaking into their room, going through her suitcase, which, by the way, this sort of thing does not happen in this hotel. The night duty concierge? Already tried. She must be asleep now. Back on tonight. By the numbers, I have to look into it and assess. Yes. Here you are. Thank you. Yup. This isn't good. We need to land. We need land to land. I have to get back. Maybe Nick landed in the water and he's still alive. Not from this height. Still no signal. We're too far out. Can you steer this thing? Look, we're going by the wind. Which is where? It's hard to say. The air currents are different up here. If we stay low, maybe... The warm air should drag us back to land. "Should"? It's worth a shot. What? The tank's empty. Okay. You're gonna have to do it. How? It's easy. Turn off the burner. Okay. Now, close the valve. There. Unhook the hose. Screw it into that tank. There you go. And make sure it's tight. All right, now loosen the valve. A little more. All right, now check the gauge. Look at the gauge. Check the gauge. So we just keep flying until we see land? Not exactly. We've got about only this much gas for an hour maybe, maybe two, then we're going down. No land. In the water. I can't. I can't go into water. It's okay. Balloons float. Baskets float. This is 400 kilos. We're going all the way down, and so am I with this leg. I was just trying to show you a good time. You lied. You're not even a pilot. I can captain it. I know everything there is to know about aerostat. Enough to kill Nick and drown us all? No, no one's gonna drown, okay? I can't drown. I can't leave Liz. Who's Liz? My little sister. I left her asleep in the room. She's in your apartment? But you said you were alone. No, I said I was single. Look, she's just a kid, but she'll wake up and she'll figure it out, you know? Someone will be coming for us soon. Right? What if we get caught? Then, no money, no house, no babies, no us. We're never gonna get caught. Never. You wanna know why? 'Cause you're too damn good, and I could never, ever, do this without you. What if I leave? You better pray I never find you. Kidding. Baby, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. One more week. That's it. Golden rule. And then we go and we go. We go see the world, together. Hey, over there, is that a boat? - Help! - Hey! Over here! Help! Help! Help! Hey, guys, look! Look! - Hey! - Hey! - Over here! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey, guys! - Hey! - Over here! Hey! - Hey! - Over here! Help! Hey! Shit! Hey! Okay. We're coming! Okay. I'm coming! Throw the rope! Throw the rope! Throw the rope while I tie it on. Hurry up! Freaking myself! All right, no, no, just give it to me. You're gonna have to go in, okay? No, no, no! - Going in! - I can't swim. I can't swim. Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Come on. Come on, go. - Come on. - Okay! - Go, go. - Get back! Come on. Stop! Get back! I'm coming! Hey! Shit! I need something heavy, to aim. No, it's mine, mine. What? What? No, give it to me! Come on! Hey, do you see that? What are they doing there? Do you think the coast guard is sending out spy balloons? Nah, it's probably just some conservationist or something. Just keep it in for now, okay? - Okay. - We need that catch. Aye, aye, sir. You took too long! You should have jumped down! You selfish piece of shit! You're selfish! You're so selfish! Boat! The boat's leaving! The boat's leaving! - Hey, hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Help! Help! Hey! - What do you need?! - Hey! A written invitation?! Huh?! The banner. The banner. Banner. Okay. Okay. Whoa! What are you doing?! Shh. Ah! Ah! Okay. Hold me. - Hold me. - What? Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Just let it go. We don't need it. Come on! I can't keep holding you! I'm gonna lose you! Come on! Please come back up! Okay, give me your hand. - Give me your hand! - I can't move! - I can't move! - I can't put my hand out. Come on, reach for my hand! Something to write with. What's something that everyone could understand? SOS? Okay. S. Shit. But I don't have any more. I need something... I don't know. I... Come on! Just read it! Please! Please! Come on! Good morning. Good morning, madam. Is the girl here? Yes. Over there. Hi, hon. You must be Liz. I came as soon as I could. Is the officer here? Yes. He's upstairs. You don't mind if I take her away, do you? Please. Be my guest. We're just gonna take a little ride down to child protection, hm? Find out who you are, contact your folks, immigration. Get a doctor to check you over. It'll be fine. They'll have ice cream there and cartoons. Do you like cartoons? I'm gonna stay here and wait for my sister. Sorry, hon. Rules are rules. If you want to find your sister, then you've got to come with me. Hey, helping folks is my job. Hm? Thank you. You cut your forehead. What's with the mirror? It was my grandmother's. My lucky charm. Ugh, not again. Have they been from the embassy? And gone. That's one good thing. Call me when you have any news. I have to go now. A jumper just came in. Mm-hm. Yes. Second floor? Clean out room 202, please. I remember this. Lighter. It's in Andrea's pocket. We need fire, fast. Okay. Spark. Friction. No, no, no, no. Sunlight? Like a glass lens. Something... Champagne bottle. No. No. No. Uh. A condom. What? It's perfect. Nick's Cypress vodka. Open. Open it. Okay. Put this on the top. Okay. Gently turn it over. Okay. Raise your hand a little bit. Just put your fingers together, just so I can... Ow. Sorry, sorry. We need something small and dry. Good. Okay, put it in the burner. We have the Share app. We both can see where we are. Kate's idea, keeping tabs. See? I know that place. Field's not far from here. It's a tourist spot. Let's go. Hold on. Does it say she's in danger? Kate? No, I guess. I mean, the signals can't... I can't reach her. It's not on our way, hon. I've only got an hour to get you processed. Processed? Taking a half day. Shopping. And while my sister's in danger, and that guy in our room. Try to understand, you're neglected, left alone in a foreign country, hungry, while she sat in the bar all night drinking. Go there, ask her yourself. No need to process anybody. And you can hit the mall early. - You win. - Yeah! Who said kids are dumb? This will be safer. Right? I didn't know money made so much smoke. What? Very smokey, I didn't know. You genius. Smoke signals. You're a genius. That's a good idea. What can we burn? Yeah. Nice trick with the condom. College education. Expensive. It was a good investment. I never had the chance to be educated. I was trapped in a backwards place. No opportunities. No future. To be a woman like you, smart, strong, see the world, escape. That was always my dream. No, I'm not strong. I'm a coward. If I had jumped, Andreas would still be here. It's not your fault. I'd give anything to see Liz again. She really needs me, but I shouldn't have dragged her here. You wanted to take care of your sister. What's wrong with that? I'd even forgive those morons on the yacht if they'd come back. Good. Hoo! Hoo, that smells. Smoke signal! Woo! Sophia! That's Kate! She's in a balloon. Look. Oh, that last guy looked torched. Yeah. I wouldn't know. Which way is the wind blowing? In the morning, out to sea, towards that wind farm. They landed there? Maybe. What's behind? The town and then the sea. Oh, so what are we waiting for?! Pilot's phone number. I'll call. Pays to work smart. Good morning. My name is Sophia, U.S. Consulate. I see your air balloon is flying today. Where are you located right now? 30 minutes. Maybe. There's always another way. Give me your phone. I wish I would have remembered this sooner. See that little hole? You put a little wire in there and that's your antenna. So you might get a better signal. Oh. We need this. Come on. Yeah. It's good enough. It's good enough. It's good enough. I understand. Thank you. I'll inform them myself. Hm? The pilot's on vacation with his wife and parents right now. And now, wants to report his balloon stolen. And my workload just doubled. - Yeah. - Mm-hm. Hold it in. Hold it in, tight. Mm-hm. She's pinged. Somewhere in the sea. Let's go! No, no! No! - No, no. - Did it send? I have a fix. Let's go. Out to sea? I'm thinking coast guard, sweetie. We need to hire a boat. - That's all. - Okay. How much money do you have? Documents, license? Don't you have any? Here. Latest model. I know you love expensive things, so... I'm not gonna buy your phone. But someone in port will take it. I don't think so. Kate is U.S. citizen! It's your job to help! Now, let's stop wasting time. Good morning, sir. So what do you want to tell me? I was just sitting there- - At dawn? Yes, just to get a good spot, you know? You've got blood on your forehead. Yes, that hit me when he came down real hard. So he wasn't run over by- - He must have jumped. From what? Those little trees over there maybe? Am I in trouble, Officer? We will see. Come on, come on. One more time. Everything out. Take the skirt off. No! - What?! - You doofus! The balloon skirt! Unbelievable! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait in the car. Kumar. Hi, Kumar. It's Sophia. I was just in your office. I know what today is. Forget I even asked. Liz! Stop right there! What are you doing? Oh! Shit. It's not over. Liz is gonna send help, I just know it. How did we get here? It was just a bit of fun. I don't want to die. Then don't die! Oh, God. If this is really it, I'm not going down without a fight! Dammit! Maybe all of this meant... Maybe it's karma. No! Karma, my ass! I'm a good person! Can I be honest? I gave your card to Jack. You were our last job, then I would have got a future. You gave my card to your boyfriend? He went in our room when Liz was in there? You dropped it, but I would have stolen it anyway. I'm a thief. Tasteless. Why? Why? Why?! Why are we stopped? Balloon's different. We're losing air. Dammit! Words. Sorry. We're sinking. - How? - Oh, I need to plug the hole. There must be something. Well, ain't that just dandy? We're gonna sink. Can I have it? Who are you gonna call? Whoa! Way to go, amigo. My life is on that thing! But we're alive. You won't be for long. Ha. Let's roll. Mira! Mira! Mira! I got you. Pull yourself up. Kick your legs. Put your head back. Kick. Making me an accomplice won't lesson your sentence. I'm a kid. I will get immunity and a social worker. You're a criminal. We're criminals. Fugitives on the run. We're not on the run. We're just in a hurry. Imagine the cop's face when he sees Kate. How are we gonna get back? How are we gonna find Kate? Oh. Sophia. Here we are. Your sister's as stubborn as you? How long do we do this? Until we find something. What if we don't? I'm not giving up, okay? Liz, you have to accept the possibility that she's gone. I'm not giving up, okay? Not her. Not on me. That was an hour ago. They drifted. Row! I can't feel my legs. Keep kicking. You'll be warmer. A ship! Here! Over here! Hey! Hey! It's coming this way! We're saved! It's no good! They can't see! They're going to hit us! Move! Go! Come on! You love me, baby? She must be here. Where is she? Look, an air balloon's a big thing. If it or Kate were here, we'd find them. Kate! Kate, where are you?! Liz, I'm sorry. Kate! You can't leave me! Kate! Hey! Cannot see us! No. Too far. But we need a signal. Hey! Kate. Kate, we have the sun. - What? - We have the sun! Okay. Yeah. - Hey! - Hey! Kate! See that? It's Kate! Kate! Go, go. Go there. Quickly, quickly. Go. Quickly, quickly. Kate! Quickly. Kate! Get in here! Oh, this is Mira, my good friend. This is Sophia, my new bestie. You, thank you. I love you. I love you. Guys, do you know where we're going? Does anyone know we're out here? Anybody got a phone?
