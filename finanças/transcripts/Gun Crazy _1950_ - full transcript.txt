I'm not only his big sister, but mother and father too. I've been trying to take care of him... ...but I guess I never earned enough to buy the things for him that other boys had. But he was good. He was always good. Never cried or nothing. I'm sure he was good, Ruby. But this obsession he seems to have for guns.... Well, when he was real little, at first it was slingshots. Used to make them himself. Then he got an old BB gun he traded for a chipmunk he'd caught and tamed. And he was always shooting it. He was a better shot than any other kid. Well, I thought maybe a boy likes to feel he's best at something. So I saved up and one Christmas I got him a brand-new BB gun. He was prouder of that than anything else in his whole life. He told me what he'd done, Judge Willoughby. And he's never killed anything since in his whole life, and he never will. It's something else about guns that gets him, not killing. - I see. - Judge Willoughby, sir. I'm Dave Allister, sir, and this is Clyde Boston. - You know him, being the sheriff's son. - Yes, Dave. Go ahead. Well, Clyde and Bart and me have been best friends ever since Bart moved to town. And what Ruby-- I mean, Miss Tare, says about Bart not wanting to kill anything-- Why, it's true, judge. Clyde and I know it is. A couple of years ago, during summer vacation... ...we went on a camping trip up in the San Lorenzo Mountains... ...near a place we called Natural Bridge. Clyde had lost his jackknife... ...and we were looking for it. All of a sudden-- - There's a mountain lion. - Where? There he is. - I see him. I see him. - You wanna try a shot? No, I'd miss. Bart's the only one who could hit him at that distance. - Go ahead, Bart. - He's not so far. You can hit him, Clyde. We can get a bounty. Go on, Bart. - The sun's a little in my eyes. - He stopped. It's a perfect shot. - Go on, Bart. - Okay. He's not gonna stand there forever. Hurry up, Bart! Go ahead, Bart. Shoot. Shoot. - No! - Here. - Fine shot you are. - Sun's a little in his eyes. You think I can't shoot when I want to? Hey, Bart, wait for us! So you see, Judge Willoughby, it's like Miss Tare just said. He wouldn't kill anything. Not even an old mountain lion that had a bounty on him. Is that all? Yes, sir. That is. Yes, sir. Now, this business of carrying a revolver. That was only last spring. - Is Miss Wynn here yet? - Yes, Your Honor. Would you tell us about this gun-carrying incident? Yes. Well, I had Bart and these other boys in the eighth grade. And on this day-- Just a moment. Would you take it more slowly, please? I'm sorry. I just feel so rushed. Well, on this particular day, I'd left the room on an errand. And when I came back to the room.... - Is it real? - Sure, it's real. - Can I shoot it? - No! How'd you get it? - Bought it off the road crew. - Do you always carry a gun? Sure. Nobody can tell what'll happen. Never can tell when you'll need it. - It sure is a beauty. - Do you shoot it? I'm probably the best shot in Cashville. - Bart Tare. - Miss Wynn! Give me that gun. It's mine. I bought it. - Give it to me at once. - It's my gun. I earned the money for it. And I'm not gonna give it to anybody. Very well. You'll have to come to the superintendent's office with me. It was as if the gun was something he simply had to have. Just as other boys have to have jackknives or harmonicas or baseball bats. He wouldn't give the gun to you or the superintendent? No, sir. Not until we called Mr. Boston. - Thank you, Miss Wynn. - Oh, yes, thank you, judge. - Did you have any trouble getting it, sheriff? - None at all. Or course, I've known him since he was a toddler. He handed it right over. Then I talked to him and his sister, and it was agreed by all of us... ...that he wouldn't have another gun until he was of age. - May I speak, judge? - Yes, Ruby. Judge, Bart's needed a man around the house. Well, this is Ira Flagler. Ira and I are going to be married next week. And we've talked it over and Ira wants Bart to live with us. Adjusting yourself to marriage, Ruby, is a job all by itself... ...without assuming extra handicaps at the start. Come here, son. In the face of your promises to all these people... ...you still broke into Meisner's hardware store and stole this gun. Yes, sir. I did. - But why? What made you do it? - I don't know. They took my gun away from me. And I've just gotta have a gun. But why? Because, like Sis says, shooting's what I'm good at. It's the only thing I like. It's what I wanna do when I grow up. You don't want to do anything with your life except shoot guns? I like shooting them, judge. I don't know why... ...but I feel good when I'm shooting them. I feel awful good inside, like I'm somebody. Well, we're not trying you here today because you like to shoot, Bart. We're trying you because guns have turned into a dangerous mania with you. You're here today because you've committed grand larceny... ...burglary, breaking and entering. We all want things, Bart. But our possession of them has to be regulated by law. And you've broken the law. You've committed a very serious crime. Now, it's my job here to think not only of what's good for you... ...but what's good for the community in which you live. And I'm afraid we're going to have to find a new environment for you, Bart. One in which you can grow up without jeopardizing the lives... ...and property of others. Bart, I'm going to send you to a school. One that's out of town. It's not a punishment. It's a school that will help you grow up. You will remain there until you're of age... ...or until this court finds reason to make a change. Children, why didn't you call me? Hello? Hello? Who? Where are you? Why didn't you let us know? We're fine. We're just fine. - Who is it, Mama? - Be quiet. Oh, they're wonderful. Wait till you see them, you'll just-- What? Yes. Hurry. - Who was it, Mama? - It's your Uncle Bart. He's come home. City desk. Who? Bart Tare! When did you get into town? No, no, I'll get somebody else to take over the desk. I'll be right over. Oh, sure. I'll pick Clyde up on my way down. Right. Joe, put her to bed. I got a celebration coming up. - Hey, Bart. - Yeah? - What are these, anyway? - English dueling pistols. - Handmade. - You really got a collection, haven't you? - Yeah. Hand me a beer, will you? - Sure. - What about you? I heard you got married. - Yep, and one boy. - No kidding. - Yep. He'll grow up to be sheriff too. How about you, Bart? Four years in reform school, and then the Army. Not getting married on that routine. I always figured you'd be regular army for the rest of your life. No, no. It gets dull. Nothing but teaching guys how to shoot. Have you seen your sister? Oh, that's.... I hate warm beer. - Have you seen Ruby yet? - Yeah. First thing. How's it feel to be uncle to a couple of swell kids like that? Pretty important. You know, I hadn't seen them before. - What are you figuring on doing now, Bart? - Well, I don't know. I don't know. I'd like to settle down. Maybe get a job with Remington, demonstrating. There's been a carnival in town lately. Let's go and have fun like we used to. Well, you got yourself a date. Our great star act. Ladies and gentlemen, as owner and manager of Packett's Carnival... ...it is I, myself, who'll present to you the famous, the dangerous... ...the beautiful Miss Annie Laurie Starr. Direct from London, England and the capitals of the continent. Before whose remarkable marksmanship... ...the greatest pistol and rifle shots in America have gone down to defeat. So here she is, ladies and gentlemen! So appealing, so dangerous, so lovely to look at. The darling of London, England, Miss Annie Laurie Starr! Frequently, during her extensive travels... ...she's been challenged by various marksmen to shoot in competition with her. Tonight, the little lady tells me she is so confident of her ability... ...that she is willing to double her offer of $250 to anyone who can outshoot her. There is only one condition: The challenging local artist must agree to award to Miss Starr... ...an honorarium of only 10 percent of the stakes she offers. An honorarium of only $50 against $500! - Do I hear a challenge? - What are you waiting for? I'll put up $20. - Yeah, I'll give you 10. - Well, I guess I've got 20. Do I--? I hear a challenge. Here's a young man who thinks he can shoot. You guys sure trust me. Well, well. Very interesting indeed. Miss Starr is always delighted to accept small donations. I suppose you have $50. Sure. I suppose you have 500. - Yeah, where's the 500? - Where is it? Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please. The cashier's tent will always gladly honor my slip for $500 to this gentleman. But first he must defeat the little lady here. Put up your money anyway. - Ladies and gentlemen, please. - Packie. Yeah? Will this do? Sure. That'll do fine. There goes my 20 bucks. Yep. And my 10. How about the crown? Would you like to light the matches? Will you? Almost killed a man once. Shot a little too low. So did I. Laurie, better let Mable wear the crown. What's the matter? You afraid I'll shoot too low? That concludes the performance for this evening. We thank you very much for your very kind attention. The show's going on out on the midway. We suggest you have fun and spend your money. Here's the money, and here's the ring. - Take good care of it, won't you? - No, no, I.... I don't think it would fit me. Thanks. - Suppose we ought to wait? - Certainly not. Hey, Bart, we'll see you in the next tent. Oh. Sure. What else do you do besides shoot? Well, that's been enough so far. - Got a job? - No. No, not yet. Maybe you have. How about it, Packie? You can always use a good man, can't you? I might be able to use you. How much do you pay? We'll talk about that. When do you leave town? Monday. - Got a car? - No. He can ride in mine. He can ride with Bluey-Bluey. Glad to have you with us. Maybe I can see you later. Why not? Hi, kid. You know, sometimes I think I look better with this stuff on. How'd it go? All right, I guess. Packett wanted us to rush it and give the concessionaires a chance at the crowd. That's where the real money is made, buster. Yes, sir. We got the crookedest little carnival layout west of the Mississippi. We've got more ways of making suckers than we got suckers. When we pull out of here, the natives'll have nothing left... ...but some old collar buttons and some rusty bobby pins. - Hey, you looking for something? - Shoes. - Going somewhere? - Yeah. Why don't you get wise to yourself? What do you mean? You're gonna see her again tonight, aren't you? - What's wrong with that? - Nothing. Except she ain't the type that makes a happy home. All right, out with it. What's on your mind? It's just that some guys are born smart about women and some are born dumb. Some guys are born clowns. You were born dumb. Hey. - On your way to Laurie's trailer? - Yeah. Why? She asked me to tell you not to bother. Why doesn't she tell me so herself? Look, son, I've lived a little longer than you have. Do I have to draw a diagram? I got a claim on her. You mean because she works for you? Better than that. But if you want to hear it from her, we'll go over there together. She-- She won't hesitate to give you the lowdown. Didn't anybody tell you about her and me? Yeah. I guess they tried to, only I was a little too dumb to understand. Come in. Oh, it's you. If you lay your hands on me like that again, I'll kill you. Like that guy you killed in St. Louis? You're gonna hold that over me all my life, aren't you? Yeah. Because you're mine. Where do you think you're going, all dressed up like that? - You don't own me, Packie. - I told him I did. I saw him coming over this way. I told him plenty. I saw the two of you. The way you were looking at each other tonight... ...like a couple of wild animals. - It almost scared me. - It should. He's a man. Honey, I'll make money like you want me to. Big money. But it takes time. Give me time. You'll never make big money. You're a two-bit guy. - Honey, listen.... - No guts, nothing. - I want action. - Action! - All right. - I told you to keep your-- Get out of here. I told you to get out of here. You're fired. Both of you. You shouldn't have shot him up till Wednesday. - Why Wednesday? - Payday. I've got money. We'll get along all right. You'd better stop at the next town. Why? We'll wanna see a justice of the peace, won't we? Is that the way you want it? That's the way I want it. It's okay with you, isn't it? Sure. It's okay with me. Laurie. Laurie, wait. What is it, Bart? Laurie, I.... - Changed your mind, Bart? - No, no. Why should I? You're signing up for an awful long term. Well, I've served a term already. Reform school. When I was a kid... ...I stole a gun from a hardware store and I.... Is that what you wanted to tell me, Bart? I wanted you to know. Bart, I've never been much good, at least up to now I haven't. You aren't getting any bargain. I'm doing all right. But I've got a funny feeling that I want to be good. I don't know, maybe I can't. - But I'm gonna try. - We'll make it. - I'll try hard, Bart. - We'll make it. I'll try. - You want onions? - Sure. Cost you a nickel more. Never mind the onions. Hold the onions. What a fool I was to think we could buck Las Vegas. We just ran into a bad streak, that's all. Well, we've still got a tank full of gas, anyway. Bart? You remember what I was talking to you about? - Yeah. - You still feel the same way about it? Somebody might get hurt. How can anybody get hurt if we don't hurt them? It's too dangerous. What a joint. No more hot water. Well, it's a roof, anyway. Yeah, it's a roof, all right. What are we gonna give the clerk when we leave? - I can still get that job at Remington. - At $40 a week? - We can get by on that. - Yeah. Maybe you can, but not me. It's too slow, Bart. I wanna do a little living. - What's your idea of living? - It's not 40 bucks a week. - Tell me, when did you get this idea? - I've always had it. Ever since I can remember. And if I don't get it one way, I'll get it the other. I didn't think we'd had it figured out that way. Well, so I've changed my mind. I told you I was no good. I didn't kid you, did I? Well, now you know. Bart, I've been kicked around all my life... ...and from now on, I'm gonna start kicking back. What is it you want? When are you going to begin to live? Four years in reform school, then the Army. I should think they'd owe you something for a change. What's it got you, being so particular? Look, let's not argue. I'll hock my guns. It'll give us enough dough to make another start. There isn't enough money in those for the start I want. Bart, I want things. A lot of things. Big things. I don't wanna be afraid of life or anything else. I want a guy with spirit and guts. A guy who can laugh at anything, who'll do anything. A guy who can kick over the traces and win the world for me. I don't wanna look in that mirror and see nothing but a stickup man staring back. You better kiss me goodbye, Bart. Because I won't be here when you get back. Come on, Bart. Let's finish it the way we started it. On the level. Could you give me a lift? Sure. Hop in. So I said, " Why should I stick around Chicago? I made my pile. Why wait for my kids to go through it?" So I spend a couple of months in California, see a few shows... ...maybe run into something nice. Who knows? Sure. There's always that chance, isn't there? Might even run into something before I get to California. - No point in waiting. - No. - Would you like to stop for a while? - Wait.... It's this next turn, so take it easy. Here comes a car. It's all right. Watch that. That's it. Here. - Thanks. - It's a sharp turn. I hope it's not too crowded. I don't think so, but watch that rock. Okay. Don't mind the people. They just see us in these outfits. - Okay. All right? - It's all right. Okay. Go ahead. You're right. It is pretty crowded. I wonder if there's gonna be a parking space. There's a car just pulled out. If we can get in there.... I guess we'll have to-- Yeah, yeah. - Okay, right in here. - Fast as you can. Don't worry. I won't be a minute longer than I have to. Here goes nothing. Okay. Get out of the way, copper, go on. That's right. Stand right there. Okay. - Hi. - Well, that's a nice getup. I like it. - Good-looking gun. - Thanks. - That's English, ain't it? - That's right. - What show you with? - Cheyenne Rodeo and Carnival. The rest will come through in a few minutes. - I got too far out in front. - You gonna play here? - No. - Well, it's an easy town on shows. Three tickets and you've got the police force. - That's a pretty nice gun you've got too. - I'm sorry. I don't let anybody handle it. I killed a man with it last year. Did he have it coming to him? Yes. But it wasn't much fun watching him go down. He had an idea he could get in the first shot-- - Watch the gears. - I will. Let me lift it. - Take off. - I was worried. - I told you to stay in the car. - Couldn't help it. The cop came out. - Just pass the car, come on. - I will. That's it. He wanted to know what show I was with. Look behind us now, will you? Is there anything in back of us? - No. - The pickup on this thing-- It's all right. It's all right. - You're sure there's no one behind us? - Yeah. Keep going. Next time stay in the car and he won't see you. You're telling me? Oh, go on. Keep going. I know what I'm doing. Look again. Did anyone make that turn behind us? - No. - You're sure? Yeah, I'm quite sure. Blue sedan. Illinois license. No number. Both dressed in cowboy clothes. Yeah, I know. Fancy. A man and a girl. - Don't kill me. - I don't want you to choke to death. Have a good time in California. Pull up easy. Pull up easy. - What's wrong? - Been a little trouble over in Hampton. - Where are you people from? - Hampton. We live two blocks away from where it happened, on the other side of Main Street. Well, drive carefully. - Thank you. - Okay. - Laurie, this isn't gonna work out. - Why not? Well, that man in the cashier's cage didn't think I was on the level. - I thought he was gonna call the cops. - Well? Well, you can't shoot a man because he hesitates. Maybe not, but you can sure scare him off, like that hotel clerk. - No, Laurie, I don't-- - Oh, Bart, you know something? - What? - I love you. I love you more than anything else in the world. Help! Help! Somebody stop them! Laurie! Laurie! Laurie, don't. Come on. Get in! - You were gonna kill that man. - He'd have killed us if he'd had the chance. They're gaining on us. Go on, faster. I can't get this thing any faster. What's the matter with it? It won't go! Shoot! Why don't you shoot? Shoot! - Shoot. Do you hear me? - All right! Get them? Yeah. Repeating: tan sedan, 1949 model... ...license number 13X572. 13X572. Joe, hold the front page. Honey, what's the matter? - What is it, darling? - Ellen says Uncle Bart's a murderer. Is he a murderer? No, darling. He's not a murderer. He's never shot anybody in his life. Just things. I wonder how that guy in Evanston's gonna feel when he finds his uniform gone. - He'll be in trouble. - He shouldn't have gotten drunk. Besides, you're very handsome in it. I have to get rid of it quick. I'm afraid of the Shore Patrol. Anyway, I hate wearing it. Why? You used to wear one. I know. But that was mine. That's when I was a fairly honest guy. You mean, before you met me? I don't know. It's just that everything's going so fast. It's all in such high gear... ...that sometimes it doesn't feel like me. Does that make sense? When do you think all this? At nights. I wake up sometimes. It's as if none of it really happened, as if nothing were real anymore. Next time you wake up, Bart, look over at me lying there beside you. I'm yours and I'm real. Yes. But you're the only thing that is, Laurie. The rest is a nightmare. How long do we have to roost here? Why don't you ask the Montana weatherman. We're stuck until we can get a tow car. We can't get a tow car until this storm's over. Maybe it won't be safe even then. Couldn't you shovel the car out yourself? Fat chance. Didn't you ever think of this? Didn't it ever occur to you that once we started... ...we could never ask anybody for help, even if we were dying, the rest of our lives... ...that we're all alone and always will be? Didn't you ever give it a thought? What's the matter, Bart? That last job. That car full of cops. I was scared. - But we're safe now, darling. We're-- - No, Laurie, listen to me. Listen close. Something happened when I was scared. All the time I was shooting that tire... ...I kept thinking how easy it would be to shoot the driver instead. - I kept fighting myself. - Bart-- Laurie, I'm not a killer. I don't want to be a killer. I don't like this kind of life. I've had enough. So have I, Bart. - Do you mean that? - Of course. - Darling, we'll go away. - Where? Out of the country, anywhere. What with? I don't get you. It's cost us everything we've gotten to keep going so far. We're broke. What are you trying to say? - One more job. - No. - One more job. A big one. - No. I'm afraid. We'll plan it carefully, take all the time we want to work it out. We'll be rich, then we'll get out of the country. We'll be together, always together. Laurie, I'm afraid. The last one. - Do you mean that? - The last one. - All right, darling. - Oh, Bart, darling. We'll make it perfect. - Then we'll split up for a while. - Split up? We'll have to. With all the pictures in the newspapers, man and woman. That would make it too easy to spot us. What's the point of doing a good job if they catch us afterwards? We'll even have two getaway cars. That'll double our chances all the way. Laurie? How long? Oh, maybe two months, three. We'll meet someplace, Miami or New Orleans. - Three months.... - It's better than three years in jail... ...in separate cells. Bart, we'll grow old together. Now, at exactly 2:00, I'll arrive at the payroll office, here. That's when there's a change of shifts on the loading platforms. The corridors will all be empty. We've got exactly six minutes to do the job and get out. You think you've got it now? - Yeah, I've got it. - All right, show me. Here's the door you come through. I'm here. Payroll window's there. We take it from the inner office... ...go through this door and down the stairs. We cut through this corridor here, over to the platforms, and our car is here. - Second car? - Six miles out. - Ridgeway. You take that car. - We drive in opposite directions. Yes. Now let's go over it again. How you doing? - Getting rich. - You'll never get rich around here. I don't know. I've got a girlfriend who works in the front office. Between us, we might get a lot of dough out of here. Don't fall for that. You know how much it costs for two to live? Just twice as much as for one. Miss Ridgeway, have you checked this list? The payroll department wants it. - Yes, Miss Sifert. - May I ask why you're wearing slacks? That's all I had today. My dry cleaning didn't come back. - I'll expect you tomorrow in a skirt. - Yes, Miss Sifert. Thanks, George. Hey. Where are you going? Well, I've got some steaks for Mr. Mallenberg's barbecue. Steaks? He doesn't want them in his office. He seems to think so. He just called over to Number Four. "Personal inspection of barbecue steaks." Guess he's giving some kind of a party. Okay. Take them along. - What's all that stuff? - Steaks for the barbecue. What barbecue? Whose steaks? - Miss Ridgeway, get back to your desk. - But he's in the wrong department. I was told to bring these steaks up to Mr. Mallenberg for his barbecue party. I'm quite certain Mr. Mallenberg would've told me if he expected-- Are you giving a party tonight? Why, no. Of course I'm not giving a party-- Get down. Get down. Give me that box. Laurie! - Why were you shooting? - Just scaring them off. You didn't hit anybody? No, but I should've hit the old biddy who set off the alarm. Laurie, I-- Wait. I.... Lots of things I meant to say, should've said them last night. Me too. - Be good. - Sure. So long, honey. Establish roadblocks. Search all out-of-state cars. Check identification. Cover tourist camps, hotels and bus stops. They are dangerous and armed. Shoot to kill. Bart! What's that? California state line. Just take it easy. Hundreds of cars go through here every day. Carrying any fruits or vegetables? - Nope. - Luggage? Just a couple of suitcases in the back seat. Guess I better have a look. - Okay. - Open this first one here. Wise guy. Start that, I give him a thorough inspection, the full treatment. Okay, you can go on. See? I told you, nothing to it. We'll get rid of the car in Pasadena, get a taxi from there. Where'd you like to stop for a while? Near the ocean? When I was a kid I lived in Brighton. My father had a shooting gallery there. I love the sea. Do you miss it? Bart, let's go for a walk on the beach. I've just been reading a story about funerals. "The funeral of Miss Augustine Sifert... ...for 23 years, office manager of the Armour Meat Packing Company... ...and William Bechtel, company guard, who were killed last Friday... ...when bandits made off with the company payroll." - Well? - Well? Two people dead. Just so we can live without working. Why? Why did you do it? Why do you have to murder people? Why can't you let them live? Because I had to. Because I was afraid. Because they would've killed you. Because you're the only thing I've got in the whole world. Because I love you. - We're killers. - You're not. - I am. - No. We both are. You go into a racket like this to get something at the point of a gun... ...you have to be ready to kill even before you start a job. I'm as guilty as you. I've just let you do my killing for me. I might as well tell you... ...I've done it before. I killed a man in St. Louis too. With Packie. We were sticking him up, and I got scared and I killed him. It's always because I get scared. I get so scared I can't even think. I can just kill. I'll go away. I will. I promise I'll never bother you again. Oh, no. We tried that once. Remember? - Yes, but this time-- - No, no. We go together, Laurie. I don't know why. Maybe like guns and ammunition go together. I'll do anything you want. Anything, Bart. Anything you say. Anything. We'll stay here for a few days. I'll figure out our next move. Bart? Well, I've just made a deal to get us across the border into Mexico. - When do we leave? - Tomorrow. Could we go out for a little while tonight? Sure. You know what we're gonna do when we get to Mexico? Buy ourselves a nice ranch and settle down. Maybe even raise those kids we talked about once. Remember? Peanuts. Peanuts, sir? One for the little boy. Big, big, big balloons here. Ten cents apiece. Thank you, lady. If I fail to guess your weight-- Lady, right here. Sit down on the scale. It's only a dime, 10 cents. If I fail to guess your weight, lady, I'll give you one of these great prizes here. I'm-- No dime? Tourists! Two, please. You know what I've been waiting for all my life? - Tell me. - Tonight. - You wanna hear something? - What? So have I. Darling, let's go home. E series. Same as the one from the hotel. - Thank you, miss. - Thank you. - My fur! - It's all right. Come on, Laurie. Come on! - I've already got a fare. - You sure have. Two of them. - Yes, sir. - Don't try anything. Bart, we head for Mexico? That takes money. It's all back in the hotel room. That hotel's full of cops by now. - I never dreamed that money was hot. - What are we gonna do? - How do we get out of town? - I don't know. Maybe we could steal a car. They'll have a highway blockade in all directions. They'll be at the airport, railroad stations and bus depot. Sorry we had to come like this, Ruby. - This is Laurie. - Why did you have to come here? Just because there's no place else to go. - Gee, what cute kids. - You're my Uncle Bart, aren't you? Yeah. Where's Ira? - He's in San Francisco on business. - Can we have something to eat? I'll put the children to bed first. Come on, children. You're going to bed. Children, Gwendolyn and Gussie can't come outside today. They've got a cold. Now, run along home and play somewhere else so it'll be quiet. Why do you have to stand there staring at me? Take our car. We're glad to give it. Anything to get you out of here. Yes, you'd like us to drive away from here in broad daylight, right? That'd be swell. Then quit staring at me. There's a phone here. I'm not taking chances. Not even with Bart's own sister. What's going on out here? Nothing. Hi, Jack. How's it going? Hello, Clyde. Got your message. Came right over. What's up? Got some news for me? I sure can use it. I don't know whether it's news or what it is. - Come on, don't be so mysterious. - Well, Paul Jackson called. I had a hunch about Bart busting out of L.A. and everything. Paul says today the shades next door are pulled down tight. Ruby's told the neighbor kids the children are sick and can't come out. Maybe it doesn't mean anything, but.... I almost wish you hadn't called me. Thought maybe you'd like to ride over with me. Sure. Sure, let's go. But, Clyde, leave your gun here. - What is it? - I thought I heard a car. - You're crazy. - Bart. - It's Dave and Clyde. - You told them we were here. Why should I want to bring disgrace to my children any sooner than necessary? Quiet, you two. Go out the back way and get in the car. I'll see you there. Okay. - Too bad you guys had to come. - Hello, Bart. Where are your guns? We're not carrying any guns. Bart, this is our town. We don't want any shooting or anybody getting hurt. Including me? Including you. Bart, we've come to ask you and Laurie to give yourselves up. I think you know that I'll do everything I can to see that you get a fair break. - That's nice. - Don't force us to make this a manhunt. Or a slaughter of some kind. Too bad you guys had to come. Bart, you know this country, these mountains, as well as we do. You know there's no chance of beating the law out. The moment you go, we'll have to turn on the alarm. There won't be a road or even a path you can get through. Well, nice seeing you both again. So long, Bart. So long. Be seeing you. Yeah. Laurie. Laurie. Laurie! I thought-- - Nobody would shoot us with the baby. - Give him to me. - But he'd be safe. - Where are Ruby and the others? - I locked them in the garage. - All right. Get in. I'll be next door. Paul's got a phone. See if Ruby and the kids are okay. The Tares have taken Highway 26 into the San Lorenzo Mountains. Block 26 and move men forward along general course of highway. They can't get out unless they abandon car and make it on foot. General alert to all sheriff's squads and troopers working district. They're armed. Bart. - That's great, isn't it? - Cut around them. Where does this road take us? Straight up into the mountains. - You all right? - Yes. Let's get out of here. Come on. Wait! Come on. - Wait. - Come on, honey. - Why do we get so tired so quick? - It's the altitude. I wanna get a lot farther than this before the sun goes down. We can rest then. Come on, honey. Bart. I can't keep my breath. - Just a little farther. - No. - Laurie, come on. - No. - Laurie. - Let them come. I'll kill them! I'll kill them! Stop it, Laurie! Stop it! Just a little farther. Then we can rest. Bart, I'm afraid. Just rest. There's nothing we can do for a while. Bart, it's so good to be so close to you. I used to go camping here... ...when I was a kid. Every summer... ...with Dave and Clyde. I think we can find a way out... ...when it's daylight. Bart, we're in real trouble this time. Laurie, no matter what happens... ...I wouldn't have it any other way. Bart? Bart, this is Clyde. We're coming in to get you. Dave and me. Answer us, Bart. You haven't got a chance. There are too many guns around this swamp. Bart, this is Dave. We're coming in, Bart. We know you won't kill us. You're not a killer, Bart. You might as well give up, Bart. It's all over. We're coming in, Bart. One more step and I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! - Laurie, don't! - I'll kill you! Laurie! Laurie! You all right, sheriff? Yeah. Yeah, we're all right.
