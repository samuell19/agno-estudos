I couldn't find the parts regarding my share of the building. “This agreement concerns the two and a half floor building at block” Look, two and a half floor. That’s your house… There. "The ownership of the building is to be shared so that 40% will be turned over to the property owner. You get five apartments in the new building. You know, as we agreed earlier. Any questions? Don’t hesitate to ask me. I don’t want you to be left with any questions in your mind, you see. How many apartments do you get? Six. But that includes Okan’s share. Okan is a dear friend to me… What do you mean, six? You mean one half of the building will have five apartments, and the other six? No, of course not. I was assuming the top floor as a single apartment. You know, I will join the two apartments that are my share... How many does Okan get? That's written in the agreement already. About everything else, you don't have to worry. We'll finish this as soon as possible, God willing. And this will really make sure you're comfortably off, both Okan and you. Okay? Comfortable... Of course it will. Look at this house, Miss Müjde. How will you take care of this house all on your own after this age, with nobody to help? See, this house isn’t livable anyway... Mind your words. No, no, I don't mean any disrespect. You told me only recently that the house has constantly been causing you expenses... I was just being candid. No, you’re being disrespectful. I’ve lived in this house for 40 years. I was raised in this house. So was Okan. I’m not your friend just because you know my son! Why are you getting angry for no reason? Miss Müjde, I was just telling you what I was seeing. Let me tell you what you’re seeing: Types like you see nothing but money. Please don’t say that. I’m not a man to care about worldly possessions. Oh, so you erect those skyscrapers for Allah? Miss Müjde, I don’t care about money. All I want is to get your good prayers. Our prophet has said, “I take pride in the wealth of my ummah." We have to work today, so that we can leave behind a beautiful homeland for our children tomorrow, both mine and yours. Right? It’s all for them. There’s a store on the ground floor in the project. You're quick-witted. You don't miss anything, maşallah. Aleyküm Selam brother. That's not a store. Something like a storeroom. No I wasn't talk to you. How are you? Yes. No, man, it’s way too early for that! I don’t do that in business hours! My country, the people of my country matter to me above all. By allowing three and a half million unqualified Syrians into the country, they've already diminished the gross national product by three percent. - But what do you mean by "unqualified" here? These people are unqualified, that's one thing. And, did these people leave their countries? They did... Hello, mom. How are you? Okan? Why are you calling at this hour? I just wanted to hear your voice. And I thought I’d congratulate you. For what? I got the news from Berat. I mean, do you fully trust him? Mom, just trust your son. I trust him, you trust me. Am I stupid? I hope this man doesn’t turn out to be like your ex-partner… Don’t be silly, mom. The man is from Isparta anyway. Had I not been sure of him, I wouldn’t have let him in your house. I’m not stupid. What’s that got to do with anything? Mom, you’re reading way too much into things. We’ve all come together for this and we’re all trying to do something good for you. Can’t you see that? Perhaps after a certain age, one sees things differently. Huh? I said, I’m getting old. Oh. Okay. Now, about the moving, how will you do it? Did Berat tell you anything about that? No. Will you have time? Mom, we talked about that. Nazlı’s father is having an operation. I need to take Nazlı to Eskişehir. Oh, right. Okay, I arranged that with Mustafa already. Is it the carrier? Okay, good. But don’t pay him money. They’ll make out an invoice. Give it to Engin. Or don’t, I’ll pick it up when I come back. Berat has to pay for it. You shouldn’t spend anything out of your own pocket. I know what to do with the invoice, Okan. I’ll take care of it. Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. I’ll send Engin to oversee the porters anyway. No, I don’t need Engin. I can handle this myself. Okay, we’ll talk about this later. What will you do now? Go to your friends. I'll sleep now. Good night then. As Turkey, we have been hosting a total of four and a half million Syrian and Iraqi refugees in our country... Turn left from here. I’m moving a house. I need help. Transportation. Oh, transportation. Okay, okay. 200 Liras for one person, for two 400. Two person is not enough. I need three. Do you speak English? It's a two storey house. Two people is not enough, I need three. Do you speak English? Do you speak English? Yes, I speak English. I'm moving the house. I need help. I need three people not two. They want 200 liras for each person. - Is that okay for you? - Okay. - Can you come too? - Me? - Do you want me too? - Yes, I need someone who speak English... - You okay? - Yes. I'm okay. I'll fucking kill you. Thank you. Sorry, I can take more. - Thank you. - Bon appetite. Enough. Bon appetite. Thank you, auntie. I won’t have any. I’ve had a late breakfast. Suit yourself. Hallaç Hüseyin St. Number 3? Yes? Auntie, I ordered it. - How much brother? - 30 liras. You guys finished already? Have you tidied up the house? Auntie Müjde is staying here tonight. Open up some room for her to walk. Talk to me, man! Are you mute or what? I’m tired of these men. They’re hungry, they have nowhere to sleep, and they’re still doing half-assed work. It’s alright. They’ve left everything nice and tidy. No, they’re all lazy bastards. They can’t withstand hardship. See, they’ve never done any hard work in Syria. It shows. What time are you coming tomorrow? They’ll be here at 8 in the morning. There’s not much left to do anyway. They’ll finish early tomorrow. I need to go to the bank early, so I’ll come at noon. Call me if you need anything. You've my number anyway. Don’t be late. If anyone is late, I’ll deduct from his wage. And take a bath when you go home. You all stink. Go on. Good morning. Welcome. Your other friend? Ah, Sayyid. I don't know. I didn't see him. Ok. Breakfast is ready. After that you can start from here. Ok? - Selamun Aleykum. - Aleykum Selam. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm OK. Are you sure? Yes. Yes. I'm sorry I've had an accident. Nothing serious. I should get started. I'm already very late. Stop. Stop. Put it down. Put it down. They finish here. You go up, put curtains, other things in boxes. Okay? - Sayyid? - Yes, Miss Müjde? Sayyid your name, right? Yes. Sayyid. It is very bad. No, no. It is very bad. We have to do... Pansuman. Pansuman? Yes. Pansuman. Come. Come, sit. I won't hurt. How did it happen? Don't worry, it is not important. I am used to this behaviour. Did you go to police? Why? Don't worry. I'm ok. Do you have a family here? Are they in Syria? They're all dead. I am sorry Sayyid. I didn't know. I wasn’t at home when they died. I was working. Zeineb and Rauf were at home. Rauf is my son. He was seven years old. Our house was bombed by Russian planes. I found Zeineb two hours later. She was dead. And your son? We searched for two days non stop. I couldn't save him. I am sorry Sayyid. I don't know what to say. I didn't want to leave my country. I don't know why this war started. You're very young Sayyid. There's a whole life in front of you. You're a good person. No. I'm not a good person. But you are a very good person. My friends say I'm very... stubborn. Stubborn? Yes. We always fight. Stubborn, but a very good person. I'm sorry. My hands are heavy. I'm getting old. No. Your hands are soft. The downstairs is done, Auntie Müjde. I thought I’d let you know. Ok. This room is done. Sayyid. Antibiotic. You must take antibiotic. I have no appetite, but they're very delicious. I can't sleep nights, it affects my appetite. Finally. I thought you’d never bring it. Şermin, you start complaining again. What did I say? If it was up to you, we'll wait another hour. Don't you eat something, Müjde? No, I won’t have anything. Are you on a diet? - Not a diet, but I... - If you’re dieting, I wonder what we should do! Look at our bellies! Oh, where did you take these photos? - Let me look at it. Good heavens! Look at her coquetry! Like a 20 year old! Yasemin should get you an Instagram account. Mother and daughter, you’re both hot. She should get me an account if I can message Cenk on Survivor from there! Don’t let her father hear that… My daughter loves Erdem. No honey, we’ve gotten old now. We can only watch those men on TV after this age. Why'd you say that? What’s wrong with your age? What can I say? We’ve lived the good life back in our time when we were young girls. Come on, what good life did you live when you were a young girl? You mean there were men at the sewing course? Of course there were. Not in the sewing course, but in the neighborhood. So Müjde, it’s been nearly 3 months and you still didn’t invite us to your new apartment. How is it? Are you getting used to it? Sorry, I’ve taken a long time moving in and getting settled. What a moving, it's not finished yet! I'm very curious. Was the moving hard? Okan must have helped you. No, Okan has been very busy. I hired a few porters. Müjde, I was going to ask you but I forgot: Where did you hire the porters? There’s a labor market under the overpass. A few workers from there helped me. Oh, isn’t that place full of Syrians? Yes, the ones I hired were Syrians too. - Oh, don't. - Are you kidding? I admire your courage. How come you can just let a bunch of Syrians into your house? They could be burglars, rapists, anything. Why? Turkish or Syrian, what difference does it make? It makes a lot of difference. I don’t know. I see them around the field near the street market sometimes. I see them come and go. With beards, turbans and burqas and all. And they smell bad. I heard it on a TV debate the other day. Most of the ones coming to Turkey are criminals. Assad opened the gates of all the prisons and sent all the criminals over to us. Yes, I watched the same debate. People say they have their thumbs cut. What? They have their thumbs cut. - They have their thumbs cut? - Yes. To make it easier to do pickpocketing. Oh goodness! I’ve had enough. I want them to leave. The state looks after them better than it looks after us. Millions of our young people are on the streets. Just look at Ayten’s daughter. She graduated from university... speaks a foreign language, and she’s been without work for a year. We don’t have to look after those people! No, we're not. Don’t say that, Şermin. May God never make anyone have to leave their homeland… They're enjoying themselves here for free. Who says they’re enjoying themselves? - They’re all working day and night for a pittance. - We see it on the news every day: robberies, rape... Just the other day they molested a four year old child… - God damn them. - They all need to be deported! Before they came, this country had morals, and order. Am I wrong? You're wrong. Five million refugees live in this country. Women, children… You don’t mean they’re all thieves and rapists, do you? You sound like you don’t have a bit of humanity left in you… Müjde, I think you should come to your senses, dear. You moved house, and suddenly you’re talking all different. I wonder if you hear what you’re saying. People struggle for life and death. You’re parroting the stupid things you hear left and right. I guess you’re upset today. Can’t you see what they did to our country? If you like your country so much, why did you send your son to Europe? Me? Have you woken up on the wrong side of bed or what Müjde? We’ve been staying on your good side but you’re getting carried away. Hah, right on time. Eat sweet, talk sweet. I don't have an appetite. Kalbim. Are you hungry? Hope it's not burning already. Hmm. It is okay. It is perfect. Excellent. Are you crying? Kalbim? Who make you cry? Nobody. Hey, you know you can tell me everything. There's nothing. Just- Is it because of me? No. No. I cause you a lot of problem. Sayyid, you are the best thing that has happened to me. I am crying because I am happy. I liked it. Kalbim... I have to tell you something. I’m going back to Syria. I found my son. Rauf is alive. You remember my friend? Hassan. The doctor. I told you about. There was a child in his hospital who was a friend of Rauf, He was in a coma but he started talking again. And he told Hassan, Rauf never went home that day. They were playing in the streets. And when they bomb, they all ran away. So, Rauf is alive. That's why I couldn't find Rauf's body. Because he's alive. He's not dead. I have to find him. I can't leave him there. Rauf is a very smart child. He found a way to survive. Kalbim. I'm coming with you. - No. - Yes. - No you're not coming. - Yes I'm coming. Kalbim it's too dangerous. The war is still going on. But you're going? It's my son, I have no choice. I don't want you to go alone. I won't let you go alone. Kalbim, please it's too dangerous. I'm gonna bring my son. Sayyid I want to help you. What can I do? You already help me a lot. How much money you need? I have money. Sayyid. Please. You need money. Please let me help you. Kalbim, you gave me everything. You gave me love. You gave me your heart. You gave me life. What more can you give? - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I'm gonna find my son. No matter what. And I'm going to come back. I love you Sayyid. I love you, Kalbim. Don't cry. Thank you. I have to go now. Don't worry, Sayyid. Rauf is alive. Mom! Mom! What happened mom? - Mom! Do you hear me? Are you okay? - Miss Müjde! - Call the ambulance! - I'm calling. Mom, what happened to you? No pulse! Oh Miss Müjde! Did you call it, did you call the ambulance? - Serhat give me a cigarette. - Of course. Here. All this for 3000 liras. Was it worth it? You ruined your life, and that poor woman’s too. - Sir? - Fuck! What the hell? You son of a bitch! Take them, now! Go! Take them! Turkey belongs to Turks and it will be!
