Who is able to break through the circle of life and doom? Don't look back Keep on track to break the curse Take the chance Design your universe We can't undo what we have done So show us now what we've become Confront us with our viciousness And our weakness We can't evade our destiny So show responsibility For we all surely have a sense Of our consciousness To take for taking's sake Will leave a path of loss and strain And endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason If you can't let go, you will end up empty handed If you can't control, you'll live your life in vain Who decides about what's true or false? Who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes? Don't look back Keep on track to break the curse Take the chance Design your universe We can't undo what we have done So show us now what we've become Confront us with our viciousness And our weakness We can't evade our destiny So show responsibility For we all surely have a sense Of our consciousness The time has come, we have to see That total wisdom is in reach The time has come to colour in the lines We must identify the signs So many people are full of hate While love and light are in their reach So many people will harm themselves But life can be so beautiful So many people will idolize While their own success is in their reach Don't forget you're able to Design your own universe Find your balance, sink into rumination Ipsum te reperies (Potire mundorum) (Potire omnis mundi) We can't undo what we have done So show us now what we've become Confront us with our viciousness And our weakness We can't evade our destiny So show responsibility For we all surely have a sense Of our consciousness Of our consciousness - Come on everybody! - Wave goodbye to EPICA! - Thank you so much! - We love you guys!

Thank you very much! ________________ * Storm the Sorrow * Along the way I find myself To be confined within me No place for any other's mind to interfere To grasp the meaning of it all To overcome my limits And dance away from any void and empty tones Just tell me why Just tell me how I can survive this time Believe yourself and look away From all that's right within you Leave all your worries at the door and drift away I've tried to peer into the core But could not storm the sorrow My hollow heart has bled me dry, left me to stray Another time without a trace Condemn me now Send me to hell For I'm already failing Intertwine the lines That swim beneath the dark Realize the pain we live in Demonize the need we reel in, no In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know Centuries of dreams unending Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed No time should ever go to waste It's not that complicated You're free to live your life at ease No more restraint No heed for shadows on your way That try to steal your laughter Your light will drive them all away Be confident Will I refrain? Can I repent? Will you be there? Erase the page For I'm alone and ailing Intertwine the lines That swim beneath the dark Realize the pain we live in Demonize the need we reel in, no In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know Centuries of dreams unending Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed So, this is my life And it can't break me down Go, I will decide Who can come in and heal my disease Burn it in flames Kill it and maim Why can't you see that you need to be freed? Intertwine the lines beneath the dark Every bit of pain we're feeling Every other solemn life, no In the memories you will find somehow There used to be a dream unending No more need to be alone Intertwine the lines That swim beneath the dark Realize the pain we live in Demonize the need we reel in, no In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know Centuries of dreams unending Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed Someone had betrayed - Thank you so much! - This evening will be one we will never forget - For us this is amazing - We've seen all your faces, and we are very glad we could share this wonderful anniversary... ...together with you... ...*(without you) we wouldn't be here anymore. So thank you so much! - This last song is for all of you. May you all get home safe. - And I heard there's also an afterparty, so... - Don't drink and drive! - Enjoy! __________________ * Consign to Oblivion * - Are you ready for the last rumble?! - Put your horns up in the air!!! - Howl, howl, howl! - Go! How can we let this happen and Just keep our eyes closed 'til the end The only thing that counts is the prosperity of today Most important to us is that our bills get paid Our good intentions have always been delayed How can we let this happen and Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end When we will stand in front of heaven's gate It will be too late! Try to unlearn all that you've learnt Try to listen to your heart No, we can't understand the universe By just using our minds We are so afraid of all the things unknown A must we appease is the lust to get laid Nothing really matters, just devouring our prey Our good intentions have always been delayed so Our generous acts have always come too late How can we let this happen and Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end When we will stand in front of heaven's gate It will be too late! Try to unlearn all that you've learnt Try to listen to your heart No, we can't understand the universe By just using our minds We are so afraid of all the things unknown We just flee into a dream that never comes true Low, low, low to the ground we feel safe Low, low, low to the ground we feel brave (Oblivisci tempta quod didicisti) Open your eyes, we're not in paradise How can't you see this stress is killing me? Fulfil your dreams, life is not what is seems to be We have captured time So time made us all hostages without mercy (Seemingly generous fooling ourselves) (Selfishly venomous time tells) Too much thinking goes at the cost of all our intuition Our thoughts create reality, but we neglect to be! So we're already slaves of our artificial world We shouldn't try to control life But listen to the laws of nature Open your eyes, we're not in paradise How can't you see this stress is killing me? Fulfil your dreams, life is not what is seems to be We have captured time So time made us all hostages without mercy - Hands up everybody!!! Low, low, low to the ground we feel safe Low, low, low to the ground we feel brave We all think we're generous But we only fool ourselves The only thing that matters is Our way and our vision Selfishly we're venomous But you know the time tells us There is more to life Than our higher positions, race for perfection, better, faster We must return to the laws of the nature Free ourselves from madness - Thank you all so very much! We will never forget this.
