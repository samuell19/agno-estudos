All he tells me is that he's tired. Keeping the house in order is no walk in the park. He's not a very exciting person to begin with. I can't tell what he's thinking. That's why I'm always frustrated. His salary never seems to improve. I'm taking on side jobs to keep our household going. We've been married 10 years. Is this what our life is meant to be? I wonder why we can't make it work. I can't tell what she's thinking. I'm sure arguing with me is no fun for her either. My married life is starting to be more of a burden. I don't know what to do. I've lost interest in my wife and home. The life of a long-married couple is not that stable if you think about it. After 10 years of marriage what have we gained? We've probably lost more than we gained. Ma'am, we're going out now. Is Mr. Matsuyama going with you? I need him to find work or I'll go crazy. Good-bye. We're off now. Hello. Welcome. Hello. Have a nice day. Hello. Hi. Welcome. Do you know of anyone who would buy this from me? What is it? That belonged to your father. This one was my brother's. They're both deceased. I can do what I like with them. Does your mother know? No. You haven't told her? I don't think it matters. Your brother's is in good condition. I thik Ms. Taeko will be angry. I'll give her seme of the money if I sell them. She'll appreciate it. How are things between your mother and Ms. Taeko? They'll never see eye-to-eye. My father and my brother are gone. And my uncle has no intention of leaving. Speaking of your uncle, isn't he entitled to a pension from the military? Yes. He's started getting an attitude about it Morning. You're a late riser as usual. Nice to see you. How much will you get for that? It doesn't pay much. Don't you want to start a business with me? I'm fed up with barely getting by while working for others. You're dreaming big. Aren't you tired of making things for other people? You have a point I repeat my dull routine every day. Right? That's why it's good to get out. If you're going out, can I come along? Don't be silly. If you aren't, will you model for my painting? What's my hourly rate? -What? She's quite shrewd. -Did Mr. Matsuyama go out? -Yes. His wife's got a tough life. She has to support her husband and his mother. Do you know where she works? At a store in Ginza. Those places open late in the day but they also close late. I see. I guess you don't know. What do you mean? I've been helping a friend lately painting billboards. We were doing some decoration for this bar in Ginza the other day. I saw her at the bar. I couldn't believe my eyes. But a waiter confirmed it. I was surprised to see her there. She cleaned up well and really looked the part. Are you telling the truth? Why would I lie? Wow. She looks like a school teacher to me. You never know with women. Hey, lady. Watch out. What happened? I'm sorry. I spilled a bucket of water. Thanks for your help. Sorry it took so long. -It looks the same every time. -Right. Ms. Sagara, your lunch always looks appetizing. Do you make it yourself? -Yes. That's quite an effort. Since I don't eat breakfast, I put a lot into my lunch. I envy you. Don't you, Nakagawa? Yes, I do. Do you want to take that with you? No, I'll leave it here. I'll need to part with it some day. Takuji, you must behave. -Yes. Can I go outside? Don't go far. We're leaving soon. Takuji, here. Buy yourself something with this. -Thank you. -You're very thoughtful. I wish I could live a relaxed life in a house like this. -Relaxed? -Yes. Don't be silly. I live with strangers. Strangers are easier to live with. I envy you. Well, the grass is always greener. We're not in a good place financially. We managed to sell one house in Mitaka. But we used the money to pay down our debt. The rest keeps dwindling every month. I feel helpless. What's your uncle doing about it? His old age gets in the way of finding work. But young people aren't serious. I've been giving some serious thought to this. To what? Leaving the family to be on my own with Takuji. Really? Maybe I could run a used book or a dressmaker's shop. I think I can support myself. But it's not that easy. It's easier to get married. But I have a child with me. No one wants baggage. You would be surprised. Don't you know anyone? You're kidding. Why don't you fall in love? Hey, Matsuyama. Are you on your way home? Yes. Where did you go? I was looking for work, but didn't have much luck. Are you going to stick around here? I guess l'll go home, too. You're lucky your wife works. I used to be her husband. Now l'm just her baggage. It's not working out for us right now. What do you mean by that? I don't want her to feel like she owes me, her "former" husband. Her feelings for me are gone. I'm thinking of leaving her. Leaving her would be my sincere gift to her. I'm home. Shall I lock up now? Yes, please. You fell asleep here again. I don't want you to catch cold. I feel like I've been had. She's a Christian. Used to be a grade school teacher. We all have to do what's necessary to earn a living. But can you believe she's a hostess at a bar? Mr. Nakagawa. Where are you off to? I was thinking of walking to Ginza. -Can I come along? -Of course. LAMBRE GREAT MUSIC AND COFFEE Thank you. -Is two enough? -Yes. Do you know this piece? I'm not into music much. -It's a violin concerto by Lalo. -Right. I love this piece. I hope it won't be any trouble if I give you this. Is this for a concert? It's for an art exhibition. My friend is showing her paintings. Only if you have time and are interested. Actually, I love paintings. Appreciating them is another story. There are no rules. You just have to enjoy them. An art school student is stayin with us. He teaches me a lot. -An art school student? -Yes. My friend always encourages me. I'm thinking of taking up painting. That's commendable. You're enjoying your life. I don't have much else going on. I envy you. Would you like to go to the exhibition next Sunday? I'd like to go with you. That sounds nice. What? Eiko is leaving? What about Matsuyama? He's out. She's leaving him and leaving us. I know. I'll ask her to wait for Mr. Matsuyama. What are we supposed to do? Please come home early. Mr. Matsuyama will be shocked when he comes back. She even took their cooking stove. Eiko is quite shrewd. She praised you for working hard. She seems sweet. But she's actually quite tough. Is that you, Mr. Matsuyama? I'm back. Mr. Matsuyama, it was quite a day today. Don't scare me like that. I see you're drunk. Hi, l'm home. Welcome back. Why don't you go upstairs to find out? What happened? Why don't you give him some food? What do you mean? He wasn't expecting this to happen. He could use some help. You're too nice to people. That would only start a bad habit. They haven't paid the rent yet. I'm only talking about tonight. I'm sure he's hungry. We don't have any leftovers. Can I come in? Please come in. I don't know what to say. I tried to stop her. She told me she'd be back. Then she rushed out of here. This is very embarrassing. I didn't think she could be this harsh. You need to talk it over with her if you want to end it peacefully. She left a letter inside the futon. She said not to look for her. It's not my place to say this, but this isn't a good way to end. This tempura is for you. Please enjoy. Oh. I visited an old schoolmate today. We had a drink at a tempura restaurant in Asakusa. He bought me this as a souvenir. This is sake from Hiroshima. It's great to drink cold. Maybe you'd like to try it with me. My husband was suggesting we should serve you dinner. Would you like some? -Not me. -Let's drink. Okay. Just a little. My friend is helping me find work. I wanted to surprise her with the good news. So you were able to find work. I have a good prospect. That's nice. This looks delicious. Our relationship needed some major mending. I actually feel relieved now that she's left me like this. I'll make a fresh start and try hard at everything. I'll go after money like a fiend. Here you go. Please enjoy the sake. You know, l'm going out today. Really? I'm going out, too. Why don't you stay home for a change on a Sunday? Well, but I really need to go to this place. Where do you need to go? I'm attending a meeting at the general director's house. Is that true? Of course it is. UGUISUDANI STATION I can't remember the last time I was here. That's the museum. Right? Yes, that's right. The art museum is that way. The zoo is beyond the art museum. How about the art school? It's that way. It's called Tokyo University of the Arts. Oh, that's right. Isn't it nice to get out? Yes, it's a nice change from the daily routine. This is a painting of my child. Is that so? How old is he? He's four years old. He's a mischievous boy. I didn't expect that from Eiko. She has changed a lot What's her husband doing? He's on his own. Really. If he leaves, th^re are other paying tenants who want to move in. Since I introduced Eiko to you, you think l'm responsible. I don't mean that at all. But I needed to get out since I was a bit upset. Hefs hit bottom. I hope you take good care of your husband. His head is in the clouds, too. What happened? Can you talk to Mr. Matsuyama? I don't want to keep him if he doesn't pay the rent. Let's leave him alone for a little while. You're too nice. You don't appreciate how hard I work in my side job. I know you work hard. But I don't know if you can call it a side job. How rude. We get no rent from Mr. Matsuyama or Mr. Tanimura. Mr. Nakagawa, can I borrow a cigarette? -A cigarette? -I'll repay you tomorrow. I have six left. I'll give you three. I appreciate your kindness. Wouldn't it be great if we had coffee? You have no shame. Don't you think life is boring? I'm always hungry. I'm not in love. And I can't get into my painting either. What are you painting now? A girl and some flowers. You're fantasizing again. I prefer to paint my fantasies. Yoshimi refused to model for him. She has no appreciation for art. She never goes to art shows. I want to go to France. If I could go with a sweet girl, I'd have no complaints. Now you're being cocky. I wonder what Mr. Matsuyama is doing. He may be working on his resume. He's writing something every night. He's still in love with Eiko. Do couples fall for each other even more when they break up? Why do you ask? He shared with me a delicious sandwich he got from Eiko. Are you saying they're seeing each other? Supposedly she's giving him some money. Why doesn't he go to her then? What's he thinking? Hey, don't take that. Lambre. Mr. Nakagawa, where's Lambre? It's in Ginza. Osaka? Is that your... Tha's where I'm from. I Ieft my husband's family after he passed away. I've managed to support my child and myself. My mother and my brother insist that I come home. Will you get married there? No one wants to marry a woman with a child. I think you're wrong. Ms. Sagara, you'll be very popular. I don't believe that. Now that you and I have gotten to know each other, it'd be a shame for me to go back to Osaka. But there's nothing I can do. Would you like to go to a movie? Yes, I would. It stinks in here. Is the power working properly? This girl in your painting looks like Yoshimi. You think so? Monsieur is out late today. I'm sure he's taking a stroll somewhere enjoying the nice weather. Maybe he's got a girlfriend. He wouldn't do that. You might be surprised. Even Eiko used to say she had a crush on Mr. Nakagawa. Is it okay if I write you sometimes? Of course. I'll write you, too. Do you promise? Pinky promise. I'll be lost for a while after you move to Osaka. I'd chase you if I were younger. But I can't do anything about it. I don't know what to do. I dream about you every night, Ms. Sagara. I've also had dreams about you. -Go in. -Don't touch me. I'm not going to run away. Don't tear my kimono. What happened, Mr. Matsuyama? This woman has been unfaithful. She needs to be punished. Calm down, Mr. Matsuyama. -Please excuse me. -Hey, don't run away. Hey, Mr. Matsuyama. -Wait up. -Mr. Matsuyama. What's going on, Eiko? I'm sorry about this. Listen, Eiko. You already ruined one man. You think you can just live the good life. Mr. Matsuyama. Can you keep it down? My husband isn't home yet. The neighbors can hear you. You cheated on me. And you think you can keep on living. You need to be disciplined properly. Mr. Matsuyama, calm down. Hey, Eiko. -Take a deep breath. -Eiko, come here. Where did he get so drunk? He was already drunk when he came. I thought he'd go home if I got him even more drunk. He wouldn't leave me alone. Hey, Eiko. You can't just leave him like that. He's become our burden. We rent the room to you. I'm very sorry. But I have no feelings for him. I waited for him for so long. When he came back, he was a completely different person. He's such a coward now. He completely depends on me. I didn't wait for him so he'd have such an unhappy married life. I've had enough. I want the freedom to live my own life. How's he doing? He fell asleep. -Welcome home. -Thanks. You're finally home. You won't believe what happened to Mr. Matsuyama. What happened? He got drunk and dragged Eiko here. He caused quite a commotion. -Is Eiko still here? -Yes. What about Matsuyama? He's sleeping. -That must have been awful. -It was. Is there any registered mail for me? It's not here yet. How about a love letter? I guess no money or women for me. I wonder how Mr. Matsuyama is doing since he went back home? I have no idea. I m off. From Sagara... OSAKA CASTLE TOWER Mr. Kawai, wait for me. May I come in? I haven't seen you for quite a while. It's been a long time. I've wanted to come apologize, but time just slipped by. Mr. Matsuyama has left. I know. That's why I came over. Mr. Tanimura is gone. I was just relaxing by myself. Please come in. Sit here, please. How did you know Mr. Matsuyama left? Were you watching, Eiko? I just know. He was wandering around in front of the bar. I decided to sell some of my things. I gave the money him so he'd go away. I see. I felt sorry for Mr. Matsuyama when he left. He said he might go to the mountain and become a monk. He has no intention of working. He can make it if he wants to. Eiko... Are you going to work forever? Two people have shown interest in me. But neither one can provide any guarantee. I'm done with marriage. I'm going to enjoy my freedom. I admire you. I can't be tough like you. I would marry a man like your husband. Don't be fooled. He's not reliable. You can't trust men. Even if they look rich today, tomorrow could be another story. We women have to be careful. I guess that's true. This is for you. Thank you. I have a favor to ask. What is it? Can I rent a room? It's actually for my friend. Well... She would pay good money for the deposit and rent. Is that right? Does she work at your bar? Yes. She's single, but has a good heart. Her patron visits twice a month. Her patron? I hope you'll help her. Let me think about it. I'll talk to my husband and get back to you. Thanks. Welcome home. Eiko stopped by today. She wants us to rent a room to her friend. I don't want to get involved. She's single and quiet. She would pay 50,000 yen for the deposit. How do you feel about it? Why are you asking me? It's usually your decision. I'll leave the upstairs room up to you. Her patron visits her once or twice a month. Really? That bothers me a bit. I don't want to rent it. But we could use the money. What for? Why do you ask? You need some new clothes. I could use some new kimonos. We could also visit Hakone for the day. You can do whatever you want. I'm going to Osaka on business in a few days. Are you going to Osaka by yourself? I'll be going with the general director. Speaking of Osaka, a postcard from Ms. Sagara arrived today. There you go. A month has passed since I moved to Osaka. Cherry blossom season has ended. I hope you're doing well. My son has made new friends. I keep reminiscing about the Tokyo sky. Please take care of your health. Did Ms. Sagara work for your company? Yes, she was our-typist. Were you close to her? She was a colleague. Is she young? She has a child. Is she married? She's a widow. You could see her when you go to Osaka. I'm jealous. I wish I could travel. With each minute, we're getting further away from Tokyo and our families. And the train keeps moving west. It's nice to spread our wings for a change. I agree. You're lucky. You have no children. You think I am? I think children would add more excitement to our lives. I have four kids to support. I feel like a workhorse. Get a load of her. I wonder what type of woman she is. She doesn't look like a dancer or a housewife. Maybe she's a geisha. She's probably 25 or 26. I think she's older than that. Looks like she's traveling alone. Is the new renter a young person? I haven't decided if she's going to rent. She might be your age. You must be excited, Mr. Tanimura. I'll be fine. Women don't like me. I'm no match for your handsome husband. He always says my husband is popular with the ladies. Really? Do you have any proof? Not really. -Hello. -It's been a while. Did you arrive last night? I arrived in the evening. Why haven't you written? I did write to you. A postcard. How late can you stay? I have to be home by 10:00. Would you like to go to a movie? A movie? I'm sure you've seen the new ones in Tokyo. I don't want to see a movie. You're acting like a youngster. Maybe we should grab a bite. Do you know of a good place? Somewhere quiet so we can talk. That'd be nice. How about a quiet inn? An inn? I wonder what time it is. It doesn't matter. Well, I know. What's the matter? I often think about my situation. I think about being with you. I know it would only bring us hardship. We'd be in misery. I don't care if we face hardship. We shouldn't hold back if we love each other. You're leaving tomorrow. I don't know how I can go on without you. I wish I could go back with you. Why don't you say anything? I wish we could freeze this moment. -Can you take it upstairs? -Yes. Welcome home. Is someone moving in? Yes, I decided to rent the upstairs room. She put down 50,000 yen. Is that right? She brought a nice refrigerator. I wonder if it's electric. She also has an electric gramophone. -Can you make me some tea? -Okay. Hello. Is Ms. Mineuchi here? -Ms. Mineuchi? -Yes. -Thanks for stopping by yesterday. -No problem. -Please come in. -Thank you. Is this your husband? Yes, His name is Nakagawa. I'm Mineuchi. I'll be renting upstairs. Daddy, this is Mr. Nakagawa. My name is Kito. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Please come in. -Thank you for your business. -Thanks. That's her patron. I was surprised when I met him yesterday. I'm hungry. Can you make me something? Those two are off to Atami. Men are just self-centered. They manipulate young women with money. Didn't you see Ms. Sagara in Osaka? Did you see her? Yes, I did. Just as I expected. Isn't she the one who went to the art exhibit with you? Someone saw you. Are you in love with her? You love her, don't you? You do. I didn't mean to hurt you. I wanted to tell you sooner. My goodness. Do you love her more than me? I love her. Are you serious? All men are selfish. They're all unfaithful. I knew something was wrong. But I didn't think you'd have an affair. If you had a spine, you wouldn't let women approach you. I can't believe what we're facing. This is awful. It's just awful. I should leave you, but I'll never do it I'm back. -Coffee, please. -Yes. I can understand why women fall for your husband. You better watch out. You could be headed for a disaster. You think so? They say midlife affairs are very hard to get over. But he's not even a rich man. Love needs no planning. I've experienced enough men in my life to know this. Mr. Nakagawa is not a happy-go-lucky guy who falls for just any woman. That's why you must be careful. Welcome home. Your wife is still out. Okay. That sure was some mayhem last night. It wasn't that bad. I'll make some tea. No thanks. Aren't you hungry? -How about some coffee? -Sounds good. It's okay for her to spend the night But won't Mr. Nakagawa worry? It'll be good for him to worry for once. Isn't that right? Yes. -Black tea, please. -Yes. Have you decided to leave your husband, Mineko? Well, I haven't decided. He's such a nice man. He's useful to begin with. He cleans the yard and chops wood. Matsuyama was useless. He was just angry at the world. But, you know… I can't stand the thought of him loving another woman. I can't accept it. It's indecent. Do you think you can find one happily married couple in this world? It's only human to pretend nothing's wrong. I think I should go to Osaka. You should focus on holding onto your husband's heart. You shouldn't blame him too much. But whenever I face him, it makes me very upset. -Hey, Tanimura. -Yes? Have you ever been in love? In love? That sounds nice. Yes, I have been in love. That's promising. Falling in love is a rite of passage. It would only improve your painting. My paintings are good already. Well, maybe they aren't. I think you use too much paint in your paintings. You think so? What I'm trying to do is pour life into my paintings. -Pour life into your paintings? -Yes. I see. Pour life into them... You're back. I'm off to work. Wait. Didn't you worry where I was last night? Didn't you go see your mother? I'm too embarrassed to go see my mother. Hello. Is anybody home? Is this Mr. Nakagawa's house? Yes, It is. I believe a woman named Mineuchi is renting a room here. Yes, she is. But she’s out right now. I'm Kito's wife. What? This is very embarrassing. I've been hurt by her. She's caused me so much grief. I hired someone to find out where she lives. Would you like to come in? Thank you very much. -Please come in. -Yes. This way please. For the past three months, I haven't had much sleep. My husband owns a furniture shop. He's completely manipulated by her. He never comes home now. He only comes home to grab money and goods. He keeps falling for silly tricks. It just infuriates me. I completely understand. She was referred to me by a friend. My friend begged to let her move in. If only I had known. Can I wait here until Mineuchi returns? They left for Atami two days ago. They went to Atami? I understand you have a vacation house in Ito. No, we have no such thing. My aunt has a sweet shop there. They said there's a telephone. They told me I could call if there was an emergency. They gave me the phone number. That's the butcher's number. They let others use their phone. That's why women think he's an easy mark. I can't believe what l'm hearing. And your husband fell for a woman working at a bar. I'm truly disappointed. Shortly after you left work yesterday, your wife came here. My wife? I told her the truth. I wasn't that close to Ms. Sagara. She made me uncomfortable. Is that so? I'm sorry about that. Ms. Sakurai is here to see you. Okay. Hi. Mr. Nakagawa, you shouldn't disappoint Mineko like that. I guess she went to see you, too. She told me everything. I always trusted you. What did she tell you? She wants to know your true feelings. You shouldn't hurt her like that. I'm the one who's hurt. You should have kept it to yourself. You shouldn't have told her. You think so? My guess is you're not truly in love with the other woman. Don't be a fool. Just be a good husband. Mineko only has you to rely on. Thanks. I still have some business to do here. Aren't you off tomorrow? Yes, I am. I'll come by your house tomorrow. Please be there. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Should we get a divorce? Don't come to my office to poke around. I only went there because I was very concerned. How could you tell others about us? I can't stand it. I'm sad that you no longer have feelings for me. I wrote a letter to that woman in Osaka. What did you write? I told her exactly how I feel. I told her not to pursue you. How could you do such a thing? Was I wrong to? Setsuko agreed that I should. Hello. -Hi. -Nice of you to come. Is she still sleeping? I guess you're still depressed. I thought it might be the case. That's why I stopped by. It's almost lunchtime. It's time to get up. Come on. Get up. Mr. Nakagawa, how would you like to eat this? What is it? Isn't this a great-looking halibut? We'll use half as sashimi. What shall I do with the rest? Who's going to cook? I am. I didn't know you could cook. I guess you've never had my cooking. I need to borrow your apron. Here you go. I cook the rest in butter, brought some lemons. Okay. Is this the only knife you have? Don't you have a sashimi knife? I guess we don't. This knife has quite a bit of rust on it. Do you have a grindstone? Your kitchen could use some cleaning up. You only have one kitchen towel. This looks like a student's kitchen. I thought Mineko was a better wife. What meals does she usually cook? They aren't very tasty. Of course not- I'm disappointed with Mineko. Can you sharpen this as well? You're finally up. I'm going to make you a feast. Let's drink and enjoy the fresh halibut I brought today. I'm going to go see my parents. What's the matter? Why are you so angry? I came over to cheer you up. Instead of cheering me up, you bad-mouth me behind my back. I see. You're fed up with me. But I don't think you mean it. You should think about our long friendship. Mineko, do you have other friends you can discuss your true feelings with? I don't want any friends. Everyone is such a liar. I can manage my own business. Even if I divorce Nakagawa, I won't be needing your advice. Let me say this now. You're a cold-hearted person. Have you ever offered anything to others? I don't mean to sound condescending. You haven't offered anything to anyone. You're never happy with what you're given. I've never acted like that. You have for a long time. Not only to your friends, but to everybody. Your current situation is a good example. You're wrong. A single woman like you wouldn't understand about us. Mr. Nakagawa, l'm going home. I'm speechless. I'm appalled at her. You should just leave her. I don't think I'll see you again. I wish you the best of luck. I'm going to stay with my parents for a while. What are you doing with that knife? Do you know how to cook fish? Fish? Well... I lived with a fisherman once. I know a little about cooking fish. Good. Can you try it then? This is delicious. Love is very sweet The flowers in the field What's the matter? You know, the light turns on even in this dreary household of mine. This is a sure sign of civilization. Your wife is out late. My wife? She's at her parents' spreading her wings. ''The time to dress up is getting further away. Time passes by one second at a time." Isn't that a nice quote? Yes. Time just keeps passing on forever. Don't you think humans are boring creatures? We might be. Love is very sweet The flowers in the field Mr. Nakagawa, would you like to go fishing with me? I'm a bit tied up right now. You're very devoted to your family. But you can still go sometime. I can't even think about fishing. I don't have the money or the time. Hello. What? I arrived in Tokyo last night. Oh, I see. Could I see you? How about that place, Lambre? I'll be there around 5:00. I'll meet you there. See you then. -There you go. -Thanks. Someone is here to see you. SOBEI NIIMURA -Nice to see you. -Yes. Nakagawa... I'm here to talk to you about Mineko. I'm representing the whole Niimura family. What are your intentions with Mineko? Well... Are you going to leave her for another woman? No, that's not it. I'll pay a proper visit. I know that times have changed. But a husband and wife cannot be separated so easily You broke Mineko's heart, just so you could be happy. God won't allow that to happen. You must take responsibility. Anyway, I need you to come see the Niimura family with me. Whatever your decision, you need to come with me. We need you to spell out your decision. I have a meeting scheduled later today. I will visit tomorrow. I need you to come tonight It doesn't matter how late. I'll visit tonight then. I'll be waiting. When did you arrive? Last night. Where are you staying? At my friend's in Koenji. -What would you like? -Something cold. -Two orders of soda water. -Yes. -Have you been well? -Yes. You look like you've lost weight. You told me so in Osaka. Did I? I don't remember. I'm hungry. Didn't you eat lunch? Only one bowl of noodles. What about your lunch from home? My wife is staying at her parents. Didn't my wife write you? Yes. You must have been offended by what she wrote. Not at all. I understand why she's angry. But her letter made me realize one thing. My love for you is real. You know, Sister, it'll be too late to realize how nice he is after you're divorced. But he no longer has feelings for me. How did it come to this? He has his pride as a man. I have my pride as a woman. You don't know anything about men. If you looked the other way, he'd feel trapped. His heart is empty. He has no compassion for me. I can't live with such a person. I can't believe it. You're acting like a newlywed. Take it easy, Yoshimi. I don't place much importance on people's feelings. If everyone were disciplined, we wouldn't need any laws or temples, we wouldn't need prisons or churches. Human will is not reliable. That's why we need customs. You say that because you're not married yet. RESTAURANT TACHIBANA I'm opening a business with a friend selling skirts and blouses in a small shop. Really? I came to see my uncle to consult him about funds. Do people buy skirts? There are many working women in Osaka. We want to specialize in inexpensive skirts then start selling blouses. Planning this business helps me. It distracts me from missing you. Let's go away together. We can go to Atami or Yugawara. But... Come on, let's go. To be honest, I hesitated to see you. I shouldn't have contacted you. It was wrong for me to see you. What are you saying? We should leave now. I have to go back or my friend will be worried. Why don't you call her? I'm meeting someone tomorrow morning. I can't do it tonight. Then we'll do it tomorrow. Let's meet at Lambre. Are you serious? I'll be there at 5:30. Got it? Wha's taking Nakagawa so long? He has no intention of coming. He said he'd come. I thought he had more respect for me. He's not being disrespectful. He may appear gentle, but he can be cold-hearted. I bet he won't come. He might have gone home and gone to bed. Stop it, Yoshimi. Morning. Good morning. I may not come home tonight. Are you traveling? Yes, a business trip. Is your wife still staying at her parents? She said she'd be gone at least a week. She's determined. You're prettier without too much rouge. Too much makes you look unsophisticated. Don't I look too pale? It's much more effective to put on lipstick properly. Women are pitiful. You're not attentive enough. When you go home and see him, just act cute and apologize. Why do I have to apologize? You just don't get it. I don't have a problem with going back. But I still can't believe it. -I'll give you my money. -What? Go have your hair done. Maybe go see a movie. Then you should go home tonight. Don't worry. I have some money. Why don't you call his office? Yes, I will. When men fall for other women, don't they care about their relationship with their wives? Of course. They're human, too. That's why divorce court is always busy. Will divorce court be able to help me? Don't be silly. -Welcome back. -Hello. -Your husband won't be back tonight. -What? He said it had something to do with his work. I see. It's a beautiful season now. It only makes me want to travel somewhere. I'm off now. RESTAURANT TACHIBANA I'm exhausted. Me, too. I can't move anymore. Here's a souvenir for you. Thank you. Hello, we're back. FUSAKO SAGARA KOENJI 4-CHOME 57 Hello, excuse me. I'm here to see a woman from Osaka. Her name is Ms. Sagara. I see. Please wait a moment I'm Sagara. May I ask who you are? I'm Nakagawa's wife. I'd like to speak to you in private. I apologize for my sudden visit. I'm on my way out. I'd like to speak to you outside. When did you arrive in Tokyo? Is it okay to talk while we walk? How about some tea somewhere? I don't want any tea. I didn't come here to relax with you. You're causing me such grief. This is a life-or-death situation for me. I had to see you in person. That's why I came here today. You can imagine the shock when I found out. I didn't believe it at first. I heard you used to work at his office. When did you start having a relationship with him? My husband and I have gone through a lot together. We've been married for a long time. We can't be broken up so easily. Society won't allow it. TSUBAME SNACK BAR -Welcome. -Can I have some water? Yes. Two orders of black tea, please. Yes. I refuse to get divorced just to receive alimony from him. If you still want to be with him, I'll kill myself and haunt both of you. I've heard enough. I have a lot to do before I head back to Osaka tonight. I haven't told you all I want to say. Aren't you meeting my husband today? I knew it. I'm not. You're lying. I can see right through you. You plan on meeting my husband and taking him somewhere. Please tell me. I'd like to hear your true feelings. Can you leave him? I'd like you to leave him. Do you understand? I had to come see you because l've reached my limit. I hope this is the last time I see you. So I want to hear your feelings for once and for all. You're very old-fashioned. I told you I'm going back to Osaka tonight. -Are you Mr. Nakagawa? -Yes. A woman stopped by and left this for you. SAGARA What happened to her? She left right away. Okay. Thanks. Your wife visited me this morning. I'm upset as I write this. I didn't want to meet your wife. I had no intention of even finding out who she was. I felt paralyzed when I met her. But it helped me make up my mind. I must leave you. I have nothing else to say to you. I wish you happiness. I'll lead my own life. Good-bye. -Here are some sweets for you. -Thank you. -Is your husband still out? -Yes. My Daddy hasn’t shown up yet either. Welcome. -Beer. -Right away. WIFE OF FURNITURE MAKER KILLS SELF BY TAKING POISON Do you think she knows? I don't know. Women are unpredictable. I can‘t believe she killed herself. She didn't have to take her life. You’re absolutely right Welcome home. It was late at night. He finally came home. He was drunk. He didn't say a word to me. I didn't say anything either. He pulled out the futon and went to sleep. We don't say a word to each other. The night passes and dawn breaks. He leaves for work as usual. I wonder if divorce is the only solution. Once we get divorced, both of us may feel refreshed. But... Once, I trusted him completely. His feelings for me are gone. I couldn't tell that woman half of what I wanted to tell her. Was I supposed to just back off? If I left this house now, where would I go? But if I don't leave, I may face the same situation again. Is that what being a woman or a wife is supposed to be? OCR and corrected by VirgilZ
