Paris is magnificent in the spring. Now, you try. End of side four. Plan on starting my New Year there. New beginnings. Well, Paris is the place. Two tickets? No, just one. Well... If you're looking, Paris is the place. People are so real, man. Race, who you fuck, it doesn't matter. I met my lover there. Maybe you will get lucky, too. -Hello? -Miss Holiday, girl. Where are you? Where are you... Blue, I'm on my way. Look, now I know we're not taking that broke down car of yours. Yes, I'm taking my car, and it's not going to break down, okay? -Bye, fool. -Don't you hang up on me, girl. Miss Holiday, I told you to sell that piece of car. I don't care if it was Fisher's. Now look at us. Just stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. God, you're like a sissy with his legs stuck in midair. Ready, but nothing's happening. Over here we got Holiday before Fisher's death. And over here, well, this is where Fisher is going to be reincarnated in France. And what do you have right here in the middle staring you in your face? Blue, you giving me a headache, girl. No, missy, everything gives you a headache. Your big head hurts 'cause your little head ain't getting enough. Somebody, please help me! Please just help me! He's beating on my mom, please! Help. Help me. Please. He's beating up on my mama, hurry. Holiday? What you doing? Miss Holiday? Get back over here, girl! She might have an Uzi! Holiday! Taxi! I typically have to whip your ass, all right. It's gonna be the last ass you whip! I ain't playing with you! You know what, I'm gonna kill you! Mom! Shit! I don't want to hurt you, man. -But I'll go ahead. -Hey, asshole! What's the matter? You can't find a man to beat up on? Get your hands off me. Now, come on. Yeah, throw another punch. I want the undertaker to earn his fee, 'cause he gonna be picking up pieces of your ass all over this damn building. Now come on, macho man. Trick or treat? Just what I thought. Little bitch! You okay, girl? Come on, we gonna get you out of here. Stupid ass faggot friends out here. Run a knife on me? Huh? Lookie here, Wanda. Oh, no! LT, not my stories! -Not my stories! -Now, please. Not my mama's stories. You ain't never gonna be shit. You ignorant junkie! You can't read. You don't know if I can write. You sissy. We gonna get your mom out of here. That's my place over there. Oh, I was going to get that fixed, but I thought until somebody moved in, why bother. People just ain't raising their kids to value anything anymore. Does this work? Last time I looked, Miss Niki. Now, I usually only rent to the old and infirmed. Well, I ain't old, but I guess I'm infirmed. Well, baby, we all got a story to tell. Don't worry. I wasn't about to tell you anything. Mama, I got my own bedroom! My own bedroom! But, baby, there ain't even a bed in there. So I know. I'll just make me a pallet on the floor. That's what I usually do. Well, maybe we can see about finding you a bed. I may have something downstairs in the storage or in my other building. Now I'm only helping you out for a month or so. I'm planning a big trip overseas. I can't pay you much 'cause he took my last check. Don't worry about that. We'll talk about that in the morning. I think Miss Niki here needs her beauty sleep. Now, tomorrow we go over house rules. I called out your name In a mystic dream last night Saw that old smile that I miss It was a beautiful smile Now, baby, I don't know what you and God cooking up, but I'm only taking them in for a few days. I ain't letting nothing get in the way of Paris. Each time I... Knowing that you're not here But what can I do Hello? Miss Holiday, girl, what happened to you? I've been looking for you all night long, honey. Blue, Blue, stop screaming. I'm still alive. Hey! May I come in? I'm sorry about tonight. I thought he was going to stay clean this time. You shouldn't have thrown his stuff in the toilet, though. You knew that was gonna make him mad. We're not going back, are we? No. No, Niki. No, ma'am. You know, I made you a promise. I am not gonna be around drugs anymore. No, ma'am. Not in this life. You know what? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna start writing. I'm gonna start my writing again. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I can get some of my poetry together. You know how they have in the back of Essence? How they have the poetry and sisters sending their stuff from all over the country? I could get my stuff in the back of Essence. Hey, I will not stop working on my life story 'cause that's the bestseller. You know, writers... Good writers have to go through a whole lot of stuff. I've been through this. I just gotta write it down. Thanks. Child, where'd you learn to eat? The army? Okay, this is the story. I'm gonna make you a deal. And I've already prayed on it. You need to let us stay here. See, my mother needs to stay away from men for a while. I don't mean you. I just mean men that ain't no good. See, men are her weakness. She's a writer. She writes poetry and short stories. And she's been working on this book about her life when she used to do drugs. But don't worry, now she's clean. She's been rehabbing for six months. LT, you know, the one with no vocabulary? He was rehabbing too. But now he's back on the re-habit, if you know what I mean. See, I'm trying to keep my mother from doing the same thing. And I think if she becomes a famous writer like Terry McMillan or somebody, she'll never use drugs again. You feel me? Oh, I feel you. Look, Holiday, if you let us stay, I'll do anything you want. That's the deal. It's too early for Blue. Hello? Holiday, the toilet done overflown. Lorenzo gone in there. Please help me out. Okay, Miss Mason. Don't use it till I get there. Bye-bye. You ever fix a toilet? Man, you must really be rich to own two places. But you really need to fix your places up. Or, are you supposed to be a slum landlord? Now, child, you could have kept that last comment to yourself. I can always take this bed and put it back in the basement. You are so cool! Who would have thought you like rap? And you like it loud, just like I do. Yeah, who would have thought. Where have you been? I was worried sick, Niki. I left you a note. I went with Holiday. We had so much fun. He bought us all this food and he bought us a bed. Take your little womanish self in the house. Why are you being so good to us? You know, just so you know, I don't do fags. Oh, good. And just so you know, I don't do no-talent evil bitches who sleep all day instead of taking care of their damn children. Okay? What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear! Yes! It's Niki. I made you some Kool-Aid. I made you some dinner. Don't expect me to beg you to eat it. Well, come on in Laurel and Hardy. See, Mama, look. See, it ain't portable. "Isn't portable." I'm trying to get her to use correct grammar. Oh, that's very nice. Well, I hope I say this with correct grammar, but sister girl, this food sure don't look appetizing. It's all beige, isn't it? Well, let's just put it this way, Holiday can burn. So from here on out, let's say I do all the cooking. Okay? What is it anyway? I don't know. Oh, you look beautiful, darling. Yes. I don't have to go to church to fellowship with the Lord. That's what every sinner says on Sunday. Now you need to mingle to be an example for your daughter. I rebuke this nicotine in the name of Jesus. Darling, you look fab. -Yeah? -Just go in there and be yourself. Wish I had a cigarette. No. Okay, I just wish I had one. Not a lot of work history. I told Brother Holiday at church that we was really looking for someone with some experience. Cool. Thank you very much. Hey, now just hold on a minute. Lady, I do not have a minute. I just gave you 20. I have a 12-year-old daughter who's starting not to believe in me again. And I need a job. But I am not about to beg you or anybody else to work in here. And for the record. In my opinion, you got a nice little shop here, but you'd sell a lot more stuff if you liven it up. Oh, Jesus, please. Wanda, don't talk too much, girl. Brother Holiday is one of our most loyal church members. I guess if he can give you a chance, I can, too. Yes! The bible tells me so "They used to be young and firm "Quick to part and slow to learn "But my thighs are mine to keep" When you gonna write about something that doesn't involve your body parts? You know what, remind me never to show anything to you again. And you're lucky I don't show you my Sally right now. -Your what? -My Sally. My sugar bowl. -Please, darling. -Oh, yes! Happy birthday, Holiday! -It's my birthday. -It's your birthday. Okay, if these young'uns have a gun, you drop, all right? Yeah, I know, I know. Principal Reed, I'm having a real problem with you-know-who. -Not again. -Excuse me. -Are you the principal? -Yes. Excuse me. Okay, I'm Wanda Dean. This is Niki Dean. This is my daughter. Hi, Niki. Niki Dean. Remember her name now. She is brilliant. Now I'm delivering her to you as a happy straight "A" student with an imagination. And I expect you to return her to me the same way. Otherwise I can be a nightmare bitch. So if she as much gets a hangnail, you let me know, okay? -I promise you. I understand. -Okay. We'll take good care of your daughter. Have a good day, Nicole. "A nightmare bitch"? I'm just keeping it real. Where are we going? Where are we going? Hey. Happy birthday, Niki! Oh, my God! That's why you spent the whole week at my house. Your mother was up all day and night doing this. And I almost finished. Wait, look here. See, these are the goddesses, Nicolette... Nicolette and Wandesia. And they discovered their secret powers and they go on to encounter infinite possibilities in their new kingdom. Just like us, girl. Thanks, Mom. You're the best mother in the whole wide world. I love you so much. Stand back! -But it's my mother. -Stand back. I'm telling you, I just don't get how she could deny her mother like that. I mean, her mother was so good to her. Everybody has a story to tell, child. So when are you gonna tell us yours? About the time you publish your first book and looking for a second. Oh, God! In all directions under the midnight sun, the junkiest feast ever, has just begun. To the wind. Sail! Okay. I don't know. I mean, I usually have a list of wishes, but we got everything! We got a place, you're happy... And we got a family, finally! You, me and Holiday. So, I don't know, you go. Okay. I wish... I wish that I could stop wishing. With my Jesus With Jesus He is my Lord Walking with my Jesus He's around Oh, with my Jesus Can't go on He walks with me All day long I've been walking Walking with Jesus He is our Lord He is He is our Lord Oh, yeah Yeah, man, how much you want? Wanda? What's up, baby? Don't get shot, LT. -What's up, girl? -What do you think is up? Hey, give me some love, baby. Come on, man. Come on! Come on! I'm at church! Get off me! Damn! You've been my good luck charm. It ain't gonna work this time, LT. -Is that right? -That's right! -Huh? -Yeah! Come on now. What? For you, baby. If you want more where that came from, you know where to find me. Yes. Niki! What's happening? How you doin'? Come here! It's me, baby! You know, he is ignorant. Here. Wanda, look here, keep working them stories, right? -All right. -Just like I was talking about. Warrior women! Woo! Sorry about that, fellas. Cool. Cool. LT... Oh, Niki, I'm okay. I'm okay. It's all right. Mommy's okay. Come here. Come here. Sweetie, I'm all right. I was just talking to LT. I'm scared, Niki. I was thinking about maybe putting off my trip a little bit. Paris is prettier in the spring anyway. Lord knows somebody got to keep y'all out of trouble. I can't breathe! I love you! I love you too! Girl, you gonna make my makeup run. And now, you can all fight for your soul -because Holiday is here! -Holiday! I need love, love to ease my mind I need to find, find someone to call mine But Momma said Can't hurry love You'll just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take I can't hurry love No, you'll just have to wait You gotta just give it time No matter how long it takes But how many heartaches must I stand Not many, darling. Not many. Before I find a love To let me live again Right now the only thing That keeps me hanging on When I feel my strength Yet, it's almost gone I remember Momma said No, you'll just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take Can't hurry love Oh, you'll just have to wait She said just give it time No matter how long it takes Gotta wait No love, love don't come easy But I keep on waiting What's a fine woman like you doing in a place with all these fags, baby? That's my friend. What you doin' here? Looking for you. Not here, please. To hold me tight Oh! Oh! But it ain't easy Oh! Wait a minute! There's a show going on! Tell me about it. She said just give it time No matter how long it takes It's times like this I really miss getting high. Holiday, if anything ever happens to me, will you look after Niki? Girl, just 'cause I wrap my legs around you don't mean you're gonna die! Damn! I'm serious! Wanda, I would lay down my life and die for Niki. You know that, girl. I know. I know. Thank you. I love you, Holiday. Now, you entered this talent show, so we're in it to win it. So, no half stepping. Now, you win this show, and you keep on winning and then one day, all of that winning is going to take care of Holiday in his old age. Yeah, I'm gonna take care of you too. You can come live with me, my husband and our five kids. Child, you better hush your fast mouth! Ain't nothing ever coming out of you but Malindy Sings. Now, let's hear it. "Fu' real "melojous music." Ooh! Holiday, my favorite cereal. Please! You gonna learn Malindy Sings? Yeah, I'll learn it. And this cereal really helps me think. Okay! Thank you so much. "Fu' real melojous..." Wanda, open up the damn door! Mama! Mama, open the door! -Mama! -Hang on. Hang on. Go on and take your bath, girl, you look like you need one. How about some smothered chicken tonight, corn bread, mashed potatoes? My favorite. Yeah, mine too. How long has this been going on? Honey, I was up and down Michigan Avenue picking up this and that for you, Niki. So this one has money. Yipee. So, when does he move in? Or do we go shack up with him? Or does he even have a shack? Maybe he just lives and deals in his limo. So you don't have to go anywhere out of the car. You can just go in his briefcase and grab what you call, "Your little glass dick." Gee, Niki! Shit is not worth it. This is bullshit! He never has our money when he's supposed to have it, Miss Holiday. That's why I'm leaving this tired ass club. Girl, if you had any sense, you'd do the same damn thing! I mean, look at this trap. He said... Excuse me. Hey, I need to talk to you, Holiday. Negro, we ain't got shit to talk about! -Hey, man, I'm talking to you. -You're fucking... What? Man, don't ever pull away from me when I'm talking to you! You understand? So what, you don't like me? You better get over that shit. 'Cause come tomorrow, man, we're gonna be neighbors. And all of them dinners and them little outings, there ain't gonna be no more of that shit. It's Niki, it's Wanda and me. We're family now. Man, I just gotta start taking my fatherly duties seriously, 'cause I can't have my little girl being influenced by a man who wears a dress. Now, can I? Now, can I? No. This is the first month's rent and a little something extra for you, man. Stay away. Just stay away. Have a good show. You okay? He didn't hurt you, did he? He didn't hurt you, did he? All right. You're gonna be okay. You'll be fine. Niki, what are you doing in the hallway? Mama said I couldn't go to your house anymore. Don't worry, baby, I'm not gonna let anyone take my Niki away from me. I promise. Come on. Is Niki... Niki, get up and go to your bed. Can I talk to you? You look good for this time of morning. You're gonna make this hard, aren't you? I wouldn't be me if I didn't. I've been thinking that me and Niki, we've become too dependent on you. And you call yourself a writer, now, can't you do better than that? Okay, I love him. All right? You satisfied? I wanna have something that I thought I never would. A real family. Holiday, all my life I've been trying to get into the loop. I just... I'm so tired of being different. I wanted to be in a family that I could be proud of. Like a man, a wife and a child. You act like God picked you and only you, to give a hard life to. Well, look around, baby, because it's a big world out there. And believe me, it's turning mostly on misery. The only thing saving any of us is the good Lord's mercy. I am trying to talk to you. I don't want one of your religious lectures. And I don't want your bullshit, how's that? We're on the same page? Poor little orphan girl, she got passed around at foster homes. Well, try being passed around between 20 men in a jail cell. A place a 16-year-old should never have laid eyes on, let alone spend 10 years in. But he does, because he killed a man for beating up his mama. Who then, the grateful bitch, begged the authorities to lock him up and throw away the key. So don't you tell me about being in some goddamn family loop! -Oh... -No! No! I don't want sympathy. And I ain't offering any. I like how God made me. I've always had a switch in my walk and music in my talk. And if I go tomorrow, Holiday will go happy. You know why? 'Cause I got out of this world what you're supposed to, to like yourself, and to love some damn body just because you goddamn can! And the good Lord, He gave me back something extra, somebody loved me back. Fisher loved me. And that child in there loves me. And I thought you loved me, Wanda. I thought you loved me. I thought you loved me. I do. I'm sorry, Holiday. I am truly sorry. But, I know what my daughter needs. And you know she deserves a father! You call Mac Daddy in there a father? You don't know him! His heart is as big as yours. Oh, no, what's bigger, is his pocketbook. Or is it his dick? I just don't know which one, the one in his pants or the one in his briefcase. Fuck you! Fuck you! You and your damn child already did that. "Fu' real melojous music, Dat jes' strikes yo' hea't and clings, "all dem things, Heish dey moufs an' hides dey faces "When Malindy sings." The end. Oh, man! Hey! My mom painted my room and it was so beautiful. She had all... Oh, I thought I heard somebody. I just wanted to know about the talent show. -Hey, Holiday. -Hi, Wanda. Oh, Niki, you have a friend. Yeah, this is my new cousin. Silas' niece. Are you wearing makeup? Are you the fag? -Sarah! -Baby, he is a fag. She won second place. That's wonderful, Niki, I knew you could do it. I got something for you. Oh, Holiday... No, I thought they would match the necklace that I got you for your birthday. You're not wearing it. I took it off. They're beautiful, Holiday, thanks. Thank you. Can I go in now? Oh, sure, I didn't mean to keep. I just wanted to say congratulations, girl. Hey, hey, it's been a long time. So how you doin'? Child, I just been so busy, I can't even keep up with myself. You look good. Thank you. I stopped over at the shop, they said you aren't working there anymore. No, I quit because I'm writing. I just wanted to really concentrate. I think that's the key, I just wanted to focus totally on the writing. You can't be a part-time writer. And then Silas bought me a new computer and I'm busting out pages. Wanda, I know you, girl. Things ain't all bliss, are they? You know what? See, that's why I can't deal with you, Holiday. Why you always trying to make something out of nothing? I'm fine. I'm fine, honey, Niki's fine, we are fine. Oh! Well, Mr. Heart, your ticket's all together. You send me a postcard. Holiday Heart's been performing at the Penthouse for 20 plus years. And I must say, the plus feels almost as long as the 20. Yes, Holiday is moving on to bigger, and I do mean bigger, things. Have any of y'all ever been to gay Paris? Oui! Do y'all think I'll have a problem finding anything that will fit? But, you know what I miss and you know what I love. Whoo! I love the nightlife I got to boogie On the disco round oh, yeah Oh, I love the night life I got to boogie On the disco round oh, yeah Miss Holiday, I want you to meet my baby. This is Joe. Who actually happens to like my new look. Huh? What do you think, baby? It's different, right? He goes by Joe, but guess what, baby? I calls him Farmer. Girl, he got himself 40 acres and a mill. Ouch! -Girl! -So yeehaw, baby! See ya, girl, Blue's gonna be a farmer! Blue, you were right. I'm so glad to be getting out of here. I'm so happy that you are finally getting away from them me-myself-and-I bitches. Especially that pipe-sucking bitch, Miss Wanda. Oh, yeah! I saw her. Copping right behind my building. Damn! There I go. And there you go, in that red cape. Look, she ain't Lois Lane and, Holiday, you're not Superman. Wanda don't wanna be saved, baby. She's one of them microwave bitches. She want everything quick. You and I both know change don't happen like that. Now, look, if I who ain't got a single Christian bone in my body, can still get somebody. You know that your Prince Charming is just waiting to drop out of heaven for you. Look, you'll go to Paris, you'll fall in love again and get fatter! Oh! I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. -That's bullshit! Fuck this shit! -How do you know? Look, Wanda, stop that shit, okay? You better watch your mother-fucking mouth. You're supposed to be an example for Niki and I'm working to get us a house and you can't keep your end of the deal and leave that damn shit alone! You don't know what you're talking about! -You better get your shit together! -I have my shit together! Oh, that's great! Tear the fucking house up! Wanda, don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you! You don't know what kind of shit you've got going here! 'Cause I ain't a drug dealer! Look I told you, I sell it, okay? I don't use it and I don't lay down with anybody who does. Holiday! Holiday! Come on, man! -What? -Hey, Miss, can I come in? No! If you're lost that's your apartment over there, the one you paid good money to keep me out of. Look, man, I gotta go out of town on business, all right? Wanda and I, we just need a little break. Oh, Jesus! This fool must think I really care! I got my own itinerary, baby, I don't need yours! Look, man, all right? Come on, man, this ain't easy for me. Now they need you. Wanda's in trouble. Then call Johnnie Cochran, they tell me he's a miracle worker. Look, man, you better step up. Wanda has got us all in some damn trouble. Now I gotta go talk to some people. First, it was just a little bit of shit missing from my case but now it's... I'm worried about Niki. Oh, now you're worried? You didn't worry when you stepped up in here buying them everything with that damn pharmacy briefcase of yours! I thought that was you and Wanda's second child. Look, man, I know you think I ain't shit. No, you're worse than that. Shit stinks for a reason, you, just plain unnecessary. You tell Wanda I'll be back in a couple of weeks or so. Now, I'm banking on you, man. I'm banking on you loving them more than you hate me. Holiday! Wake up! Come on! Come and open the door! Who the fuck is it now? It's Wanda. Come, open the door. I wanna talk to you. I got something to tell you. Just open the door, please? I need to talk to you. Wanda, why don't you call a damn therapist? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah! Wanda, go home. Go to sleep. I'm trying! Holiday, I'm trying hard to... I'm trying... Oh, me too, Wanda! I'm trying hard to live my own life instead of being your sugar teat all the time! So why don't you just leave me to my own goddamn madness? Wanda. Au revoir! The number you have reached is not in use. What? Shit! Shit! And it's different with every hand I got I'm lending, you knew when you know I flew and I flow I wanna know what's on your mind Niki? Hey! It's Mama! Hey! You know, I have to get my head together so, uh... That's what I'm doing, I'm getting my head together. And, do you know what? I'm gonna call you. I'm calling you like... I ain't worried because I know that Holiday and Silas are taking good care of... We're the warrior women, Niki. We are warrior women! You remind Holiday of what he's promised me. You know I love you. We're warrior women! Turn that fucking music down! Light me up! Get this shit up and light me up! Niki? Now I know you're in here. Wanda? Holiday. You okay? Where's your mother? She's gone. She's been gone for two days. Why didn't you tell me, Niki? Because I thought you were mad at me. I mean, the way we treated you. I'm so sorry, Holiday. Oh, baby. You ain't got nothing to be sorry about. You comfortable? Say your prayers? I can't pray. Sing to me, Holiday. Okay, baby. Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once was lost But now I am found Was blind Lord Jesus... But now... ...I pray that you come back into this child's life. Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me Let this child be baptized. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! But now I am found Was blind But now I see And now, we will hear from Nicole Dean who graduates with honors. Nicole's poem won the school-wide poetry competition. She will now come forward and read her poem. Nicole? That's my girl! That's my Niki! The name of my poem is called "Finding the Blessing." "Where do you find the blessing "When the trees stop whispering "And the ocean stops roaring "When the pen can't write "And everything around you is one big fight "Where do you find the blessing "When everything is still "And yet your heart can no longer feel "When all the music stops playing "And a poor child won't even try praying "Where do you find the blessing "When a smile can't be found "And your own voice you can't bear to hear the sound "When a fist, a slap and whipping "Is supposed to say, 'I love you, my child,' "But all it does is make you want to go out and do something wild "Where do you find the blessing "Somebody, please tell me the score "Because I want to feel joy just once more "But my mama always said "Weeping might endure for a night "But joy comes in the morning "If you wait" Joy. Joy. "So I wait" How y'all doing? "And I try not to hate" What you looking at? "So I put my ear to the earth "And I wait "I listen, oh, so quietly "And I put my eyes to the sky "And I wait "And I try to see if blessings..." Bless her! Bless her! "Are really free..." Bless her! "But this I know "That when we are the most still" Here you go, Wanda. "That's when God really lets you feel his blessings "Flowing through you "And through me" Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Jesus. Thank you. Thank you. To high school. I mean, junior high school, Miss Thang. To our future together and to the Lord's blessings. Would you ever lie to me, Holiday? No. No, no, child, whatever you getting ready to ask me, please, don't let it give me indigestion before I even eat. Especially at these prices. Do you really sleep with men? Yes, I sleep with men. Do you feel bad about it? No. Do you feel bad about me sleeping with men? I'm not sure 'cause Silas said Mama act like something was wrong with it. Yeah, well, a lot of people feel that way. I, myself believe that when it comes to matters of the heart, the only sin is turning your back on love because of what other people think. Yeah. People think I shouldn't love my mother because she used to do drugs and, you know... But I do. Oh, darling, I know. You ain't gotta tell Holiday. Well, so are you and me gonna march in the gay parade? Oh, no, baby. I'm from the old school. I marched with King. I ain't about to start marching with the queens. I leave all that carryin' on to the younger folks. Holiday done got too old to change now. So you stay in the closet. Girl, where you get that from? The library. I've been reading up on it. Yeah, well, you ain't been reading close enough. A closet means somewhere where the door is closed. I ain't secret, and I ain't never been closed. I'm just choosy about who I invite in. You feel me? See, in my day, we believed in privacy. In your day, it's about letting it all hang out. Now, the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Anyway, girl, enough about parades and closets and things, okay? Okay. Well, I love you just the way you are. So let's toast to letting it all hang out, privately. She's back! I knew she'd come back. Mama? Hey. Niki, let her breathe. Hey! I came to give you a card. I made it. I wrote this. I've been doing some writing. That's yours. And I got you some flowers. They didn't hold up. But they almost match your dress. Sit down, Wanda. You hungry? I'll fix you something. Oh, no, I ate. I ate. But just popped by. Just wanted to say "Hey" and check on my little gal. God, I am so proud of you. No, I'm just staying with some friends for a little bit. Can I go with you? Please? Who'd be with Holiday? No, you can't go with me. I... They don't have much space and I gotta get myself together in that space. Oh, come here. Baby girl. Mama! Where's that necklace that Silas gave you with the diamonds, Niki? Wanda, shit! Get the hell out of here! No! You don't tell me! Get the hell out of here! Your child doesn't need to see you like this, Wanda! This is my house! Holiday! -Get your hands off me! -Holiday! Stop! Just take it. Thank you, my daughter, for helping me. I love you. And I'm gonna make that up to you. Wanda! Come on! Wanda, leave that! Hey, this is my stuff. That belongs to you and Niki! Silas gave me this! Go next door! He always getting me going. I just got to rectify a few things and then I'm gonna... I'll be back, I won't... Okay, bye. And don't come back here until you have yourself straight. Look at you. Drop it! I'm okay, I'm fine! Do you think I wanted her to see me like this? What's she doing home? Shit! Wanda! There you go. There you go, you're punishing me. You want to punish me. No, Wanda. Wanda, please. Please, Wanda, let me help you. Holiday, relax! Let me take you to the hospital. I'm... I'm fine. Let me take you to the hospital, please! Wanda, let me take you to the hospital. Just... -Let's go! -Come on. -It's okay. -No. Holiday. Holiday. Take care of her. Take care of her. I know you will. She stole the diamond earrings you gave me. And the little heart necklace. The first thing she ever stole from me was a bike the shelter gave me one Christmas. A real pretty red bike. You know with the red and silver streamers hanging out of the handlebars? When she thought I was asleep, she took it somewhere and got money for it. She told me some boy at the shelter stole it. But I knew better. I just didn't say anything because she already felt so bad. Do you think if people stop giving me things, then maybe she'd stop stealing from me? Come on, let's go night-night. Your mother's problems have nothing to do with you, Niki. You know, she used to be the best mother, Holiday. Really. I mean, we never had a lot of money, but she was always finding free things for us to do. You know, sometimes, we would spend the whole day in the library. No. Then we'd have a picnic somewhere. I mean, she couldn't cook. But we'd have a junk food fest. At least that's what she used to call it. Then when I was around seven she met this man. And he was into drugs. And he got her into it. Then it seemed like after that, we never really had a home again. Well, you have a home now. And whatever mistakes your mother made, she always tried to make sure that you were safe -and feeling loved. -By leaving me? Baby, sometimes leaving is the only way left to show someone how much you really do love them. Especially if they can't give you what you need. Now you get some sleep. I'm gonna have a little talk with Johnny Walker Red. 'Cause this motherhood thing drive us all to drink. Yo! Yo! I'm always looking for a good rhyme Searching my soul for fiction and fact And my right hand man And my boys on the street with my new rap band -What's up, Holiday? -What you doing here? Just came to see Niki. Surprised to see me? I thought you were in jail! Silas! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I missed you! I have so much to tell you. Come on! You missed out. What's all this? What's it look like? A robbery. What a friend we have in Jesus Whoo! Our sins and grief to bear! What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer That doesn't count! Do you know I'm trying to prepare for service tomorrow? Oh, sorry, Holiday. But this game is the bomb. Why don't you come play? Yeah, yeah, Holiday, why don't you, -come play with us, man? -Come on. No, I've never been good at things like this and I'm sure you two wanna spend some time together. -No, no, no. It's cool. Really. -Here. Really? Okay. So how do we play this? Why don't you tell him, Silas? The green button, jump. Ooh. Ooh, that little white man jumped over that big, black ball. Ooh! Yeah, I mean, she'd tick me off. And then she'd make me laugh, that's what I loved about her. I mean, she said she always wanted a house so I bought her one. You know, I stayed down there, fixed it up. Then I get back here and I find out she's been working the streets. Shit! So I left again, man. Just couldn't deal with that. You don't have to tell me. You don't owe me any explanation. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. I mean, shit, I don't know why, I just want you to understand. -No, I do. -Hey, man, what's up? Oh, please! On a good day, slim, you wouldn't be my type. Oh, please. Man, don't even go there. Is that a gun in your pants? Or you just happy to see me? It's a gun. Holiday, wake up. Wake up, wake up. -What? -Holiday, wake up. I got my period. How? Silas! Silas! The girl done become a woman. She got her period. How? I don't know. Would y'all stop asking me how and take me somewhere to get something, please? Man, we don't all have to go do that, do we? Oh, yes, we do, Mac Daddy. Let me get my face on. Condoms over there. Thank you. You know, this is junior high. I mean, dang, y'all act like I'm going to preschool. I don't need escorts. I love you. Bye. Yeah, well, I guess we should go home. Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Specifically, when are you going home? Because you're wearing my couch out. Shut up, man. I know you like having me around there for protection. Protection from whom, negro? Oh, y'all macho men always underestimating us pretty ones. You know, I was thinking I might as well just rent that apartment out. Now, don't you fucking do that. Not... Not yet. -All right? -All right. You still paying rent, so what can I say. Now, if we're going, let's get to it. Tonight, you cook. Oh, and by the way, I think I'll sit in the back. I've never been properly chauffeured. Man, you better get your ass in the car. Oh, no, you didn't. No, you didn't! I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Mama, do you hear me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mama. Mama, I did love you. Man, this is some heavy shit. I used to think that, too. But now I get how you could hate your mother. Hey! Hey, baby. I picked you up today 'cause I got somethin' I wanna talk to you about. See, I gotta do a little run. I mean, I shouldn't be gone too long. You know, two weeks, three at the most. And then, you know, we can go down to Florida. And see that house. I mean, Holiday... I mean, I'm sure he wants to go to Paris, you know. Take his little trip. He didn't say that, but... Hey, I'm gonna drop you at home. Go handle this little business. And then maybe we can go out to dinner tonight. Huh? I just wanna ride. I'll wait for you in the car while you make your delivery. Hey, I'll just be a minute. You can listen to the radio if you want to. Lock the doors. Yeah, nobody going to bother you around here. All right? They know me. Oh, that's Silas right there. You want some? Hey, little girl. You wanna make some money? I lost... Speak up, I can barely hear you. I said I lost Niki, Holiday. I left her in the car, I came back, she was gone. I can't believe you put my child in harm's way like that! I told you I didn't! All right? She said she wanted to stay in the car. I said, "Cool. Lock the doors. Stay in the car, Niki." I come back, she's gone, man. You the damn adult! Now, why didn't you just say, "No"? My girl could be anywhere. I know that, Holiday. All right? Just... Hold on, man. My pager's goin' on. No! Get rid of that goddamn beeper, Silas! Get rid of it! -Shut up! -Silas! Go on, get out of here! Come back... What did I tell you? Man, what did I tell you? You see? I ain't goin' in there no more. I ain't getting high no more. Look here, brother, this is an economic principle. I can't give you nothin' if you got nothin' on you. What you bought was... Like little Jack Horner True OG Never stop to ask questions One step ahead 'cause you know I'm the best in the land I can drop a bomb like a man on a mission Oh, yeah, shake that thing. Mama! Oh! Niki? Hey! Whoa... Mama, please. Come home. You always get better when I take care of you. We can be a family again. Just the two of us. Who this little mama? Get away from her. Ricky! You get away from her. Hey, man, come back. Hey, man! She gonna do her thing! Mama, please. Come on! "Mama"? You just... You better leave her alone. I thought you called me. Mama, please. My bad. It's... I am good for it. -Come on. -No. -Come on. -No, no, no, baby. I rather break this sweet, young thing. What? No, wait a minute. This? This... This is... This is my baby. I'm begging you. I'm begging you, 'cause... Niki... Oh, he just... He just wanna kiss you. You're a big girl. Come on. He's just gonna kiss you. He's your friend. Give me a kiss, little girl. Oh, shit! Oh! This is how you teach your little girl? You abusing me? You was just testing me? The police found Niki. I'm on the way to the station to pick her up now. Holiday, would you take this? Please, Silas, don't go. My temper sometimes speaks before I can catch up with it. That's why Wanda's in the situation that she's in. If I only had opened up the door that night... No, no, man. That wouldn't have even made a difference. People like Wanda, people like me, we expect anything good to be a surprise. And anything bad to just come like clockwork. Man, I'm trying to stay in the race. Wanda dropped out a long time ago. Well, stay in the race with Niki. She needs you. Look, man, I almost got her killed last night. She don't need me. I ain't even in a business where people can need me. Well, get out the damn business then because I need you. Yeah, but Niki would do better with one of you than a hundred of me. Later. Silas... Look, Silas... Ta-da! The bomb! I like it and all, but... You can't afford this. What's wrong with the duplex? We needed a new start, girl. Now, come on, let's take a look. It's 10:00. Where's Niki? Get the hell off my baby! If you ever touch her again, I'll be pissing on your grave, you motherfuckin' cradle robber! "Trust me, Holiday, I'm just going skating." And your little fast ass is laid up with some boy. Rather some man. I wasn't laid up with him. Look, if your feet wasn't flat on the floor, then your ass was more prone than it needed to be. I can't believe this! I'm home slavin', tryin' to fuckin' pack up my life to give you a better life. But I didn't ask you for a better life. I'm sorry, Niki. Jesus. Have I gone psycho? What am I apologizing for? I ain't Father Knows Best. And you ain't Leave It to Beaver. You lucky I ain't kicking your little behind all up and down this apartment. Lying to me, and I'm trying to take care of your trifling butt. No! I am the one owed an apology. And unless I get one right now, you gonna really see me act the queenly fool and it won't be nothin' pretty. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. I'm sorry. No, I want everybody out in the damn street to hear you. I'm sorry, Holiday. Good. Now, go to your damn room. You're grounded. Blue, I don't know what would have happened if I wouldn't have gotten there. I say the baby girl is just testing you, that's all. Just keep talking to her. Hell, I mean, if she's anythin' like you say she is, she's just scared, that's all. Look, poor baby is just scared that she's going to turn out to be like that mom of hers, that's all. She just don't know how to stop it. Yeah, you're right. I never thought about it like that. Hold on. Farmer! Milking this cow is not working, baby. Okay? We're gonna have to have some honey with that tea. Girl, he got me milking a cow. -What? -Honey, happiness in this fresh air done lifted me to the other side of brilliant, baby! Okay, girl. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Love you. I love you too, Blue. Bye-bye now. Farmer, honey, we need a new cow, baby. This one is out of milk. Okay? Now, I'm about to go to the supermarket. See you later. Damn chickens! I have a surprise for you. It's the most important thing in the world. Look. I said look. You're not her. I want you to be able to look in the mirror, and see Niki. Not your mother, not your circumstances, not anyone else. And every day it's your job, it's your God-given duty to tell that person staring at you that you love her. It's okay. It's okay, baby. You've been holding it in for a long time. That's right, let it out. Just let it out. Your Holiday's here for you. O, Christmas Tree O, Christmas Tree You stand in verdant beauty O, Christmas Tree O, Christmas Tree You stand in verdant beauty Your boughs are green in summer's glow And do not fade in winter's snow O, Christmas Tree O, Christmas Tree You stand in verdant beauty I ordered a red racing bike with red and silver streamers in the handle bars. Look, we don't have your bike. No, now, you really need to arrest that attitude, go back in the warehouse and get my damn bike by the time I get there, or I'm gonna raise all kind of holy hell and that wouldn't be nice at Christmas. Whatever, pal, we don't need your business. Oh, you really tryin' to block my salvation, aren't you? What? Oh, you don't know me. I will preach heaven and beat the hell out of you. O, Christmas Tree O, Christmas Tree You stand in verdant beauty It's Christmas time. I ain't never been away from her at Christmas time. You know what? At one time she... She had a bike and it was kinda like this. Oh, no... I probably messed it up. But I'm gonna make it up to her because... You know, all I ever really wanted was to make her happy. That's true. I just... Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get in a program. I'm gonna love the program. Twelve steps. Well, is it just... It's just the steps. I'm gonna do all the steps. You know what? I just need to... I need to come home. I just... Holiday, please let me come home. Yes. Yes, Wanda, yes. That's what I've been praying for all this time. And Niki, she misses you so much. I need to take a shower. I don't want... I know I have no presents. Never mind that. I'm gonna tell Niki that this bike is from you. I got this bike? Yes, you brought this bike. Now, I'm gonna go get my check and I'll be right back. Ooh... I got the bike. Actually this one is a mountain bike. That's good. See, I never let these whores get the upper hand. You know what I'm saying? You gotta keep them in check. It's also a boy bike. Peep, your girl... It's got these gears. It's good. -What's up, Wanda? -Oh! How you doin', girl? Holiday! Cowboy, come get this bike. Let's get out of here, man. I want my bike. I said I want my damn bike. I'm gonna knock your bitch-ass out. Come on, pussy. Come on, pussy. Get him, Holiday. You motherfucker! Oh, Jesus. -Come on, Wanda. -Let me get the bike. Wanda, hurry up. Asshole! Wanda, come on! Wanda, hurry up. We buried you next to Fisher. So, I hope he's taking good care of you now. Silas says the dead are one big happy family anyways. He's back in Florida now. I won another poetry contest writing about you. This year went by so fast. Well, I guess that's all for now. It's just so hard when you don't get to say goodbye. Look, come on now, you've been rearranging these flowers for the past two hours, and your spring break is ticking away. And here, tell, Paris is calling for a pretty little black girl and an ageless pretty black man. Is that right? Silas! So, how's my little Niki doin'? -I'm good. I missed you. -Yeah. You called him, didn't you? Well... Now Mama can really rest in peace. How's that? Because now she knows the both of you are gonna take care of me. She's always wanted two parents for me. Yeah, well, listen. When you guys get back from Paris, give me a call 'cause I got a surprise for you.
