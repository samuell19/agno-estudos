- We've been looking for you. Stop your antics and become my wife. - Leave. Or I'll beat you to a pulp with your own stick. - Are you gonna let her speak to you like that? - But what do I do? She won't do what I say? It's madness. - Women these days. They need discipline. - But I want her to like me. I want her to give me back massages and stuff. - You need to put her in her place. Put your foot down. - You better do what you're told woman! Otherwise, you're gonna, you know. - No, I don't know. - You're gonna, you know. - No, I don't know. - You're gonna regret it! - Let me handle this. She's my wife. - You wish. I belong to no one. And if you get one step closer, you will regret it. - Stand your ground! You're letting her step all over you! - Yeah, she's threatening your sacred masculine. - Defend your honor! - Show her who's boss. - Kaya, I hate it when you're weird. You better hurry. Kaya get a move on! - [Kaya] School doesn't start for half an hour Claire! - Well, it takes 20 minutes for you to walk, and I'm not driving you and missing my morning jog with Courtney! There is one thing you simply cannot do yourself, and that is wake up. - I woke up doing Kung Fu again. Like the stuff in movies. Funny thing is I've never done Kung Fu, in real life, except for what I've managed to learn off YouTube. I wish I could just prove to the world that we really do live within some primitive form of virtual reality. What happened to my Ruroni Kenshin lunch bag? - I'm helping you not look like an 8-year-old boy trapped inside a 16-year-old girl's body. Besides it matches your outfit. - It does? But what if I am an eight-year-old boy trapped in this pathetic shell of an existential experience! - You know even with your 4.3 GPA you still manage to make this foster mom, feel like an utter failure. - I flushed a sock down your toilet. To punish you for being amazing, I love you. - Good, you better. I packed you organic PB & J with sprouted wheat, promise me Kaya you're not going to eat any of that restaurant crap, I mean it. It's hormone injected meat mulch! There's enough food to last you the entire day. - Okay get out of here already you hot mom you. - Kaya, Kaya! - Hey Ramseys what've you got? - Rocks. - For how much? - For $5. - $5, you're kidding right? - Don't be a cheapskate! - Yeah don't be a cheapskate. He's has bills to pay you know? - I'll take the quartz crystal. But all I have is a dollar. - Can you believe this girl? Shameless. - Don't be a greedy. I'm offering you a dollar, take it or leave it! - But you don't get the crystal, take that one! - Fine. - Give me that! - Oh no I got to go. - How many points do I get for hitting a freak? - Whoa, hey Sasha. You're violating your restraining order you know. Cops could be anywhere. - Shut up. You think I care about a stupid restraining order? You're just an emo piss on and I'm a boss. - Okay, alright you're the boss Sasha. But I'm not going to stay quiet. You jump me again, I'm pressing charges. You can't just go around beating people up you know? I'm sorry what was that? - You can't just-- - Oh, I don't understand, I don't speak human trash. - Why are you so mean? - Give me your phone. - I don't have it. - Not not, kill kill, get it. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - I just posted on your Facebook, looks like you're already getting notifications. Good luck. - I'm unfriending you because you are a racist bigot. Sasha, how could you write that? - Like I said, good luck. You'll have much bigger fish to fry here soon. - I am not racist I was hacked! - She is a complete failure at life. - Oh, that's rough. - That's pretty pathetic. - Hey take it easy. Kaya's a survivor, she'll make sense of it pretty soon. I'm sure of it. - That anyone can survive in a world as soft as this is a mystery to be sure. - She's a warrior by birthright. Have faith Tai Fong. - Being born into one of the greatest warrior bloodlines on Earth did nothing for the others. - But Kaya is different, she has to be. - For your sake, she better be. - Well I hope she gets her act together soon, because she is boring me out of my mind. - Be careful you might have to wear those robes for another 10,000 years. - I look good, in anything. - Yeah you wish. - I do! - Hey Kaya, what's up girlfriend? - Hey, so, you didn't see the post? - Oh, I saw it, everybody saw it. That Sasha is one evil conundrum. - She's something else. Well, the usual? - You know it. - Shoot you got peanut butter and jelly with sprouted greens, girl you know how to do me. - But today I'm keeping the smoothie for myself. My biggest problem in life is my foster mom trying to overfeed me. - Yo that is a good problem. - This is true, but I still need-- - Oh, girl you know I'm good for it. We've only been doing this since 5th grade. There, you happy? - Excellent! - So, what you saving up for? Ain't you got a J-O-B? - Yo, Sabrina when yo mamma gonna find out your voluptuous curves because you eat like 10 times a day? - Man shut up Mariah. This meal would of cost me $7.50 at Nugget Market. That is like a 375% savings alright. Shoot you got me coconut almond milk! - So, what you saving up for anyway? A one-way ticket out of the projects? - The projects don't exist here. - Mariah, you don't live in no projects. You live in a 3,000-square foot house. - Yo that don't matter! - And drop your accent, that is cultural appropriation. - So you can talk like me, but I can't talk like you? That is racist. - Girl you are not marginalized therefore you need to be shut down. - Oh, I'm marginalized! - You are not marginalized! - Yes, I am marginalized!! - You got like a 7th jacuzzi in your house - So, I'm saving up for those anime Blue Rays. - Girl don't you have all those seasons? We pirated them like 4 years ago. - Now that I have money, I'm supporting the creators of content I enjoy. - Oh, I get it, you're going all straight laced on us. Turning your back on a life of crime. - I wouldn't go that far. - Yo so my boy Christian ask you out already? - What? Eww. He has a beard. - Yeah, he's 16 with a beard, that's hot. Look, you've been working with him for a month already, give him a shot! - Hmmm let me think about that. No. - See that's my girl Kaya. We are going to start up a dessert business together and we gonna be fortune 500 fools! - What are you gonna sell? You don't even know how to cook. - Man Mariah, sometimes I want to slap you. - Whatever, you don't even know how to boil water. - Kaya, I know you said you don't want to be adopted, but eval's are Monday, the offer still stands. I'd love to be your forever mom. Promise you'll think about it? - That, that was amazing. Hey, hey! Samurai Master dude, hello? I said hey! - Hoy, you can see me? - Of course, I can see you! Or I don't know, this could be a glitch in the VR system. - My name is Tai Fong. Sworn protector of the Wing Chun blood line, which is everlasting and eternal, as am I. - What? - My name is Tai Fong, sworn protector of the- - Ya, Wing Chun and all that. What is the Wing Chun blood line? - It's you. You are the bloodline. - Hi, I'm Japh. - You are the last remaining survivor of the Wing Chun blood line as we feared. This battle was one of many. I'm going to have to unlock your Chi source! - Whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing, what are you doing? - I'm unlocking your Chi source! And after that, we are leaving. This place is not safe. - Okay no, I heard I had big fish to fry. But this is not what I had in mind! - Hi, I'm Goku, and I'm amazing and powerful and you'll want my help. But I'm humble too. So, don't worship me, I'm not into that. - I think she can handle herself Goku. - Hi, I'm Sari. I'm programmed to destroy things. Angel of destruction, that's me. - So, is there like an anime convention nearby or something? Why are you all dressed like that? - Dressed like what? - Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions. Who are you people? - What do you mean by you people? - Oh no I didn't write that! - I'm kidding. - The question you should be asking is who are you? - Did you know that microprocessor has a sales history dating back to 1987? That's pretty impressive. - Oh, geez don't do that. - Excuse me? - Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't talking to you. - Do you serve anything with certified organic barley? - No. - See if you did that, you'd get so much more business. - Stop that. - What's that? - I mean, I'll tell the owner you said that. - Don't worry, they can't see us. Only you can. Which means when you talk to us, everyone thinks you're crazy. - Your cash register has enough coding capacity to be a small time machine. - Do you cook your chow mein in coconut oil? - No, it's canola oil. - Yikes, maybe not that then. - Stop it! Get away from me! You know maybe you should eat somewhere else. I'm getting the feeling that we won't be able to serve you anything that fits your standards. - Right? You understand. I mean this place is so, ugh. - It's right around the corner actually, and to the left. They have everything you deserve. - Thank you. - More of those been coming around here lately. - It's a beautiful thing to take care of yourself. It's another thing to use it as an excuse to cut people down. - That was so rude I'm going to tell your manager. - Really, because that store serves food with certified organic barley. They also have food canned in coconut oil. Like I said, they have food that fits your standards, and its everything you deserve. - How dare you? You think sending me to a dog food store is going to fly? You are so getting fired missy. - Look, you are misunderstanding me. With the whole ethical standards for all life on the planet movement, there is a whole community of people who are eating what animals eat, and enjoying it. There is even a chili made from pedigree dog food. - You're lying! - Google, it. - Sorry I didn't know. - It's okay I was just trying to help. Here's an egg roll on the house. - Seriously? I had no idea that was a thing either. - It's not. - What? - I made the website. - No! - And it's ranked #2 when you type in chili made from dog food. - Well people really got to check their facts you know? You doing anything later? - Actually, you all need to disappear. - Point taken. I wasn't trying to ask you out or anything. - Oh no! I wasn't, I was just. - No, it's cool you don't have to explain, it's okay. - Okay, I see where this is going-- You need to stop doing that! - She's right we need to leave her alone, let's go. - We will not be doing that. She needs to understand we are not going anywhere until the bloodline is restored. Do you even understand what is at stake here? - What does that even mean? I'm still not sure who any of you are! I mean every time I ask you a question, you respond with a question. And for some unknown reason you're obsessed with cutting off my arms! Who does that? - How much can she know? - Nothing, she has to figure everything out on her own. And by the looks of it, it's gonna be awhile. - So, we just hang out? Until a demon banshee tries to kill her and then we intervene? - That's what we've always done, only now she can see us doing it. - And that's not working out too well anymore. - For her it's not working out, I'm fine with it. - Why can't we tell her any of this when she won't remember it at all once the bloodline is restored? - We cannot give mortals any knowledge of the past or the future. They have to come to that information on their own agency. - He's right Japh. If we tell her anything, it could rob her of the experiences she needs to make informed decisions on her mortal walk. Our duty is to protect her. Beyond that-- - We will never gain her trust if we leave her in the dark. - Don't take it personal, but who has ever gained Kaya's trust? - How do we disappear from her sight then? - We don't. She can cross servers now. We can't hide from her. No one can. - No! - Don't! Don't! Don't! Why can't I move? - Your eye sight will be clear in a moment. Your wound is nearly healed. It's okay, you're safe. - What happened? - You were nearly killed by a demon banshee. Now you are here in the Immortal Realm. - Where is everybody? - Japh is re-scripting the last 10 minutes of the Mortal realm to save your life. That wound of yours will be tender for a little while, until he has finished the override. Sari and Goku are fending off the demon banshees so that he can work in peace. We'll have to get moving in a minute. We can't stay here for long. - I thought you said it was safe? - Nowhere is safe for long. This is the Immortal Realm. It doesn't work the same. Time, weather, everything can change. You might have the power to cross servers. But you are not an immortal. - So, you and Japh, Sari, and Goku. You are all immortals? Or users of the VR world? - Precisely! - So, you know I was thinking about what you said about who am I? I don't know the answer to that, but I don't know a whole lot about myself. I was in foster care and my parents just left me and disappeared. - Your parents did not disappear, they were killed. - They were killed? - And the rest of your family. The Wing Chun blood line is one of the seven Warrior bloodlines. Your Great Great Grandmother, Wing Chun, she was the first woman to create a Martial system of combat in the Earthly realm. You should know this by now. - Why would I know that? I was never told about where I came from or who I was. I didn't even know I had Chinese ancestors! It's not like that's physically obvious! - The only thing that is physically obvious is how weak you are. Your body structure is bone thin, flimsy even. Disappointing. - Alright, alright enough of that! I'm not gonna have you body shaming me. My feminist side is about to get real buddy, put the knife down! Okay alright we can just stop that right now please. Just put it down, okay, alright, don't do that please. Put it down, put it down. - Silence. - I'm not gonna stay silent! - I said silence! She's coming! - Who's coming? - Your grandmother! - You're standing in my shadow. - Sorry Madam. - The Mortal Realm has made you soft Tai Fong. - Maybe you're not a total disgrace. - I have brought you something. - A bag of plum cherries from the Earthly Realm I hope. - I forgot to pick them while I was fending off the demon banshees. - Well, we can't all be heroes. - I will not fail you again. - And what is this? - This is your great granddaughter. - This? Why have you not yet cut off her arm? And why is she dressed like a brothel girl? - This is how they dress in the Earthly Realm. This is a school uniform! - Then why is she here? - Her life is in danger. We confirmed today, she is the last remaining survivor. - Then it is time. Do not fail me Tai Fong. - Understood. - Hey okay wait a minute, you have no right-- - I have no right? What do you think this is? Do you want to live? - Yes. - Do you want everyone you know and care about to live? - Yes. - Then let me make one thing clear. We are in the middle of a 500-year-old war and the only way we win this war is by keeping you alive and we will do so by any means necessary. And because you are choosing to disobey my command that makes you a prisoner of war. Understood? Take her away. - That's all I can forage for tonight. So, what might we be eating? Okay I'm not trying to be rude, or make things worse for myself, but I'm starving. I haven't eaten all day! And I'm pretty sure it's a standard to feed your prisoners? I'm assuming it's a standard. - 16 years of age and you can't even retrieve your own sustenance? - What like forage for food or hunt? - Your kind makes no effort to be accountable, even for your own survival! - It's way more complicated than that okay. We have farmers that do the crop growing and animal raising, and we go to super markets and there's managers that stock the place up. And we go out, get jobs so we can earn money to pay for the food. - That is complicated. Much more complicated than digging a hole and planting a seed. - I grew carrots once. But they turned out all gnarled and kind of gross. Plus, I don't have time. - Ah and what do you do with this lack of time? - You saw it. I have a job, and I got to school. I'm a waitress, I feed people and then take their money. - Do you find that meaningful? - I don't know I guess. At least I get paid for doing it. - Money won't get you anywhere in the Immortal Realm. - I have questions and I need them answered. - As you should. - Hey! Tai Fong told me what you did. Thank you so much for saving my life. - Oh, it was nothing. All Japh did was turn a cash register into a time machine. And Sari and I held off about a thousand demon banshees. Right Sari, it was about a thousand? - I don't know I'd say about 10 thousand. - How are you? - Good. Good. It hurt for a while, but it's better now. But I just learned that I'm a prisoner apparently. Along with being sentenced to getting my arm chopped off. So, there's that. - Oh, so you met Grandmother. - Yes and she is so not grandmotherly at all. I mean not at all. - Well, she's just looking out for you. - How is that even remotely possible? Ever since I met you characters it's like I unlocked the comic con dungeon of Hell. - That bad huh? - Yeah, that's understating it. - Well, if it makes you feel better, Tai Fong isn't exactly gonna-- - TMI Japh! Hold up on the info train! - Yeah, shut up. - See that's what I'm talking about. You all are full of dark secrets. Like maybe you save my life a couple times, but it could be for some deep dark sinister purpose. Plus, I really like my arm. This is my favorite arm. - Okay, let me rephrase. - Shh. - Would you-- - Shh. - Would-- - You guys I'm asking her a question. I can do that, I can ask a question. Would you give up your arm for everyone you know and love? Would you sacrifice your arm to save everyone you know and love? - Of course, I'd give up my arm. I'd give my life. - Spoken like a true warrior. - Everyone in the Mortal Realm has something of deep and personal value. Something that they would be willing to protect and do anything for. It's part of the human existence. These demon banshees, they exist for the sole purpose of destroying the fabric of human experience. - The Mortal Realm must always have warriors to protect the innocent. And you are part of a genetic network that is ancient and specifically designed to protect the human experience. Banshees target your kind. - Wing Chun's bloodline. Your bloodline, has suffered a holocaust. - Well how do we restore the bloodline? And how do we stop the banshees? - These are loaded questions that unfortunately we cannot answer. - But what we can tell you is that everything will be better after you let Tai Fong cut off your arm. - What, why? - Remember, you said you'd sacrifice your own arm, even your life to save the ones you love. - But why does it have to be my arm? Why not his arm? - Here let me show you something. - Is that the cash register from my work? - Um yeah. - Please, please! I've been babysitting him since he was a baby. What do I have to do to save him Japh? Please! - You already know what you have to do. - Sasha and the seven-year-old psychos? Oh, I don't really care what happens to them. - You say that now but-- - But what? - Never mind. - Claire, you sneaky mom. Stop, stop, stop! - Kaya they can't hurt her. They can only hurt her if they kill you first. And we won't let that happen. - I thought they were after me? The bloodline, right? Why my friends, why Claire? We don't share a genetic code! And that's what it's all about right? This stupid bloodline! - It doesn't matter, the banshees they clear out anyone connected to you. It's how they work. There is nothing orderly or civil about them. They seek to destroy everyone and anything you've ever made a connection with. - What was that? - Japh take Kaya and run! - Listen! Listen they are desperate to end your bloodline tonight. They sent a warlord! - What's going on? - You have to let me unlock your chi source! - Oh no! No no no no no! - Save yourself! Save your loved ones! - Okay do it, do it fast! Hey I still have my arm. This thing's cool. Whoa. - Now fight!
