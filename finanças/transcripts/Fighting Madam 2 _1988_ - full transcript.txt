Iron Angels 2 - Are you Moon? - Yes. Your car is waiting. My car? Put this on. Remove it. This way. Do you have the money? It's right here, but I want to see him first. I cannot tell who it is, he wears a mask. You want to see him? Ok. First I want to see the money. You see? The money is here. Now, take off his mask. Stay put! Don’t touch me! I will not give it to you! No! Go away! Leave me! No! That's better. - Let's have a look. - How can I without my glasses? Sorry. So go ahead. Get up. Are you alright? - You bastard! - No... Move it. Don't move. Stay there, or I blow him up! You want him? Come on. Come on. Hold it! I'd rather went on vacation in Las Vegas. - I would like to go to Disneyland. - So why Kuala Lumpur? The company can not afford Vegas. Not with you two. - Bummer. - Stop complaining. It's a fun city, you'll see. At least we'll have a rest. Do they have Koala Bears? It's very hot here. Hey where is our limousine? We do not have a car? We have to walk? What? Let's take a taxi then. That’s just great. Sorry. Taxi! Taxi! You are certainly foreigners. Where do you want to go? - Hotel Continental. - No problem. I'll take you there. I'm your man. - Where is your taxi? - There it is. Perfect condition, yes. - Should we really go with him? - Yeah let’s go. Wow! Who would have thought. As I said, don't judge the car at first glance. It's very modern, we have air conditioning, automatic windows... Power locks. Step inside, you'll see. Come! Come on, please. Sir. Please. - What a crock. - Air conditioning? I feel like in a sauna. Hey, I'm dying here. What about the air-conditioning? Of course. I just lower the front window and we have fresh air. - What? - It works great! - I have enough! - Forget it. Open the window. - What's up with that control? - Windows? This needs human power. Step on the gas, we’re in a hurry. Yes, sir. Very good. You really know how to drive. It's nothing. I even raced with this taxi. And once I raced a guy, we went really fast. It turned out he was a police officer and he took my license. - So you drive without a permit? - Well, that’s just how it is. Go ahead, go ahead. It's free. Go ahead. Bye Bye. What, why did you allow the Rolls Royce to pass? Are you afraid? I’m not. All the taxi drivers do this out of respect. - Why? Do you know him? - Yes, he is a nice guy. Peter King, great philanthropist. That's him. We're in a hurry. I don’t care how nice he is. Overtake him. Go. - But... - Hey, do what the lady asks. - Move it now. - I can't... How about now? - Good! - Here. What are you doing? It's terrible, how you tourists behave! Hey, come back! That's my taxi.! Come back! - Now this is interesting. - Don't start with this now, Elaine. - What do you want? - What do I want? Overtake a car. This is the car of Mr. King, you can't just do that. Who is Mr. King? I never heard about him before. Can I take a look? Enough! - It's him. - Of course. He looks really good. - I see you still remember. - So do you, Peter. You boys done playing? - We fooled you girls huh? - Yeah you fooled us alright. That's our old trick from back in the days. College right? Why don’t you introduce us? - Sorry. Peter, Elaine. - Hello. - Hello. - Moon. - Hello. - Hello. You are my guests, I don't take a no for an answer. You live in my house. We wouldn't say no. I still have some business to attend to, one of these cars will take you to my house. - Thanks. - Ladies. Welcome to Mr. King's house. Come on. - Take the ladies to their rooms. Please go with her. - Thanks. - Mr. Fong please this way. - Ok. - If you need anything please ask. - Thank you. - Yes? - Hey, bro. - We'll have a party today. The women will stay at home. - Sounds good. Hey, and Marco is in the city. Remember what they called us? - The Three Musketeers. - Right. Ok. See you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Good Bye. One more time, one more please. - Encore! - Nice, huh? - You bet! You can get lucky with her, when you play it right. - Who will be first in line? - We do it like always. Ok. Waiter! I want to get acquainted with the singer. Bring her to me. As you wish. - Good? - Yeah. - Are you ready? Come on. One, two, three. - What are you doing? - I won. - You lost! - Hey, stop it. - What is this? - Come on! - Well, you're first, let's go. - Great. Look, there she is. That's something! - As usual? - Yeah. So what? Invite her to dinner. She is young and willing. Bring her. This is for you. Do you want to sit with us? I'm afraid I must refuse. - Now what? - She said no. - What are you waiting for. It should be a breeze. - Do it. Damn, what's going on? - Don't spoil it. - What are you talking about? According to the rules I am the winner. - Don't you realize what you had won? - Wait a minute. - Waiter, two beers! - Clear! - I tell you... Really? Trust me. You've been here long? Would you like something to drink? Look at that, you're really something. - What? - Bring me the singer. Sissy wants to talk to you. Go. What? - I can't, I'm with a the customer. - Yeah? Who are you anyway? - Sorry. - Stay here, I'll be back soon. I told you. - What is it? - We have permission. - Excuse me. - What do you want? - It seems you'll need help. Good. Don't worry, there are only about ten. - Really? - Yeah. On guard! - Done in 20 seconds. - You're right. What the...? What? I can't hit a women. Guys, what are you doing? Why do you hit a female? - It’s a transvestite. - Transvestite? You never told me. - You didn’t ask. - So you guys are transvestites? Very impressive, honey. Hey, she is also a transvestite. Watch out! Why didn't you say, they were men? - I thought you liked it. - And I thought you're my friend. - Wait... - Listen. Hey, you guys remember that song...? - I remember. - Yeah. - Come on. - Yeah. One... two... three... Old McDonald had a farm... We do not know the words. How is it that you can't remember? You can't remember them either. Look at him. Listen. I work for the CIA. I observe Peter. Peter? Why? - That's better. - You're getting older. - Back in the day you puked twice as much. - Really? Well, let us sing. - Where were we? - Let's just start again! Go ahead. And the farmer had a car... Thank you. I feel great. Thanks to our friend Peter. I love it. - Telephone, Miss Elaine. - Thank you. Yes? It's Peter. What would you like to do today? Do you have something in mind? How about a trip? My helicopter will arrive in half an hour and will take you directly to me. - Sounds wonderful. - Okay, be ready. I'll see you then. Ok great. "DELIVERY IS ON ITS WAY" This way, please. Amazing, he really has his own helicopter. Yeah. We are definitely in the wrong line of work. I wonder where he's taking us. Guess we'll find out when we're there. The building belongs to Mr. King. The upper floors are all his offices. - Thank you. - You are welcome. -So? Where are we heading? -Thought I'd show you how I make my money. Look here, they're all mine. - You have become rich with the palms? - Yes. - I get the necessary ingredients from them. - This place is really big. These are the fruits. From them we extract the oil. The oil alone is worth a fortune. I have the equipment I need, to extract the oil. We also produce hats, mats, roofing, sugar, wine... and of course the oil that I told you. The waste we use as fertilizer. Shall we go now for dinner? What do you think? - Yes. - Fine. - Come on. Finally. Did you get everything? - Good. - Unload it, it's the best quality around. Open up. Full Metal Jacket... - as you ordered. - Very good. Don't move. Get up! Go on, move it. Lieutenant, look what I found. He was snooping around here. Hurry! After him! Fire! Don't shoot, I want him alive. Get him! Next week we'll start touring the world with this show. We start in Las Vegas. Thanks. - Well, cheers then. - Cheers. - Cheers. Peter, we just want to thank you for taking the time and showing us around. No need to thank me, it was a welcome change for me. Most of the time I just sit in my office anyway. But not yesterday! Telephone Mr. King. - Yes - Major Chang speaking. We caught your friend Marco, he took photos during our deal. He's at the camp. Ok, I'll take care of it. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions. We saw you taking photos, now, who do you work for? Nothing? You will talk. - You stay here. - Sir! What's this all about? Are you insane? Nobody told you to torture him. Take the wires out of him. Out, now! I'm very sorry, the men... - I understand. - Thank you. Marco, are you alright? Peter, why are you doing this? I want to change things. - But there are other ways Peter. - No, there is only one way. We have to overthrow the government, and take matters in our own hands. Just think about the possibilities. It is all over, we and the Malaysian government... We're on to you. Your revolution will fail. - Just listen to me... - Silence. I won't hear another word. It's all set now anyway. We will be successful. I'd hoped you would join our revolution. - Peter, I... - Silence. The offer stands. Think about it. I don't want to have you killed. - It's beautiful out here. - Glad you like it. Is something bothering you? You look tired. Tired? No, everything is fine. I was just thinking about the future. You work too hard. I think they are just jealous. Well, there are two different kind of men. Those who are content with what they have. And there are those who want to change something. And I am the latter. I can't just sit around all day. I have dreams that are so big, they scare other people. Everyone of us has a dream. But just few of us can actually live their dream. I think I understand. But all in all that's no reason for you to look so depressed. It's a wonderful day, let's just enjoy it. Here. - Tell me, did I bore you? - No. Not at all. It was very interesting. - Really? - I wouldn't lie. I wish you could stay a bit longer you know. Maybe I will think about it. - Afternoon boss. - Afternoon. Do you have it with you? Here's the report. But aren't you worried that Alex might fail due to personal feelings toward Peter? No. I know him. I have total confidence. Do you want to talk to him now? Look at that, they would make a nice couple, would they? Like King and Queen. - Are you, Mr. Fong? - Yes. - You have a phone. Yes. - For me? - This way, please. - Thanks. - Here it is. - Thank you. Hello? Alex, good afternoon. Good morning. How are you? Fine. By the way boss, I'm still on vacation. Yeah sure, I know you're on vacation. Alex, listen... It's about that guy, Peter King. What about him? We have very strong suspicions... That he's behind the whole sabotage movement against the government. The Agency has sent Marco from here to investigate... But he disappeared. And to tell you the truth... We suspect that he might have been killed by that guy, Peter. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Pretty sure. Alex... We want you to take over this case immediately... - And keep us posted. - Okay boss. Be careful. What? Did you found anything? Take a look. I never thought that... Peter is now our enemy. I just can't believe that. We have to tell Elaine. I'll go and get her. Please excuse me, I still have some things to solve. - It's ok, I'm tired anyway. - See you tomorrow then? - Good night. - Good night. Elaine! We need to talk. What's the matter? What is going on between you and Peter? - Well, I like him, why do you ask? - Do you know who he is? An old friend of yours? And head of a terrorist organization. He plans a revolution. What are you talking about? Here. Read it. We found this in his room, there is no doubt about his intentions. - I don't believe you! You're lying. - Elaine! I couldn't believe it myself, but it's the truth. He wants to overthrow the government. Marco was from the CIA. He tailed him for month now. And they captured him. We are the Iron Angels, the CIA asked us to take over the case. And I accepted. No, no. - You're lying! - Elaine! Now what are we gonna do about them? You know her, she can do something stupid. Come on. Where is she? - Now what? - We follow them. Well, have you thought about it? There is nothing to think about. Peter, you have to stop. This will never work. You are out of your mind. You're wrong! We will succeed. We'll finally free our land from capitalism. No more influences from the west. You think I'm crazy? But even if you succeed, what's next then? Are you with me or not? Then you leave me no choice! I'm sorry. I'll bet. Go ahead, shoot me. Come on, you don't have the balls? - Get him! - Yes sir. Stop! Don't move. That's enough. Take her to Mr. King. Inside. What are you doing here? A friend of yours? Thank you Major,that's all. - You can go now. - Yes sir. We're leaving. - I have to tell you... - Stay back! Don't touch me! I thought we could get married. Marry? What's wrong with you? You just killed Marco and then you propose to me? You really are insane. Why don't you understand, Marco had to be killed. I had to do it. I want you to understand it. I had no other choice. How can I understand? You just killed your best friend! You want me to understand? Why, why did you have to kill him? He was executed, not just murdered Elaine. I want you to join us. Never. I'd rather die. Just execute me like Marco. Go ahead, you already know the routine. Think about it. I'll be back. - Hello? - Hi Alex. I just talked with the CIA, what's up? - We need help. - What happened? - Elaine disappeared. - Disappeared? She followed Peter and now she's gone. We think he captured her, we need to get her out. - Where are you now? - At the continental Hotel. Stay put. I'll send someone over. I'm sure she can help you. Her name is Karen. She knows the country and has good connections to the government. - She can get you everything you need. - We'll stay in touch. - Good luck. Peter has a camp around here. We'll use the helicopter to get there. He has about a hundred soldiers, armed with modern weaponry. It won't be easy, but we have some surprises for them. Tomorrow just before dawn we'll start. Get in and free Elaine as quick as possible. - But we have no weapons. - Now you have. Karen, how long 'til we're there? Just a few minutes. Remember, we just have about 3 hours. - How about them? - Don't worry. They have their own tactics. We are here. Get ready. We take the lead. Are you ok? Yes. Come here. Split up. We're near the camp. Stay together. Move it. - Are you ready? - Yes sir we are ready! Don't you ever forget the sacrifice we had to make. - The government must fall. - Down with the Government! - Free the people! - Free the people! Up there. Moon, are you ready? Ok. Karen, you go right. - Moon, ready? - Prepared. - Karen, ready? - Yes. Let's go. We will fight! Keep shooting! Go! Go! Get him! You ok? Go! Moon, where are you? Are you okay? I got it. Escape. Come on! Attack! Get them! Stop it! Are you crazy? There are explosives. - Are you okay? - Yes. This doesn't look good. Open it up! Wait. - Come on... - I, I can't... Come. Stay here. You too? And I thought you were my friend. - Like Marco? - Forget Marco! - He was executed. - And Elaine? Will she be executed too? Not if she join us, I only shoot traitors. Traitors? You killed Marco, and you would have killed Elaine too! No. I would have never killed Elaine. You have to understand. I live for this country, I want us to be free. You'll never get freedom this way Peter. - Give up. - You think you're so smart. I know what I am doing, and you will not stop me. Listen to me Peter, government troops are on their way. - Leave while you still can. - Leave? I'd rather die! Ok! You lost, friend. And so did I. Kill me. - Take the gun. - No. - Please! Do it! I don't want to live anymore! Kill me, please! Do it!
