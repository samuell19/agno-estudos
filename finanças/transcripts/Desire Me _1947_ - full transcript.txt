[Orchestral music] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Bell tolling] [Music continues] [Bell tolling] It's alright, doctor. You can tell me, I'm not afraid. Go on, I told you I'm not afraid. But you are afraid. Afraid I'll tell you there's nothing wrong with you. However, I'm not going to say that. Because there is a great deal wrong with you. It's my heart, isn't it? I know. It-it pounds so that I can't breathe sometimes. There's nothing wrong with your heart, organically. You're sick, but not in the way you think. Don't try to soften it, you see, I know. I know that I'm going to die. You know it because you want to die. You're willing yourself to die. The physical examination I made of you indicates You are free from bodily illness. But you don't want to accept that, do you? You'd rather have me tell you that your heart was feeling bad That you were doomed Than to tell you the truth. - The truth? - It's quite simple. Something is making you so desperately unhappy That you'd die rather than face it. Then you don't believe that I feel pain? Of course I believe it, that pain is pretty real, to you. Oh, yes, the pain is there. But it's there only because something has happened In your life that you are not able to bear. You've tried to forget it and you've failed. The pain you feel is proof of that failure. And so it becomes a pain to hide behind. And you want a doctor to tell you that you are sick in body. Because you can't face the sickness of your soul. But don't you see, you'll get no release? A bottle of medicine, a box of pills or surgeon's knife You'll find no answer there. - Where then? - Within yourself. 'Meet this inner conflict.' 'Understand it and then set it right.' It'll not be easy. But I think it's the only possible help for you And for the man who loves you. The only way I can help him is by letting him forget me. Our life together... Has no meaning. No meaning? For you or for him? Not for either of us. Because of me, I've tried to be the way I was before. I've tried to go on, but I can't. I can't let him touch me, doctor. He's so good, he's so kind. It's not-it's not fair. But you shut him out. The way you shut him out of your heart and your mind. He's suffered enough. I'm not gonna let him suffer anymore. I'm not going back to him. 'He's waiting for you.' But it's no use. I have nothing left for him... or for anyone. Marise, I knew your father and mother when they were alive. I watched you grow up. You were a child well worth watching. You always had courage. - Have you changed? - Yes. That's not possible. The girl I remember faced life without fear. She went to work to care for her widowed mother. Met the young fisherman from Brittany one day Married him the next. No, that girl will always have courage. You are right about one thing. When I first met Paul, in those days I wasn't afraid. From the moment he looked at me, I knew. I think he did too. We talked and he told me about his country. The people and his fishing fleet and his boat house in the sea. All at once, it was my country too. Oh, we were happy, doctor, so happy. But it lasted such a little while. Why, Marise? Why? Well, the war. Paul was one of the first to go. Then, few letters. After that, silence. Go on, Marise. He was in a reprisal camp. It was one of the worst. [Instrumental music] The place where the Germans 'Sent the most dangerous prisoners of war.' 'Men who'd tried many times to escape.' 'And he would try again.' 'Paul met a man there.' 'His name was Jean Renaud.' [Music continues] [Men humming] Why did you start that song again? I won't get it out of my head all night. The first day I met her in Paris. They played it over and over that day. Let me see her picture again, Aubert. Wait for the light. Be careful, Renaud. It's her hair, a man notices... And her skin. - White skin, red hair. - I know. "Carrot top," that's what I used to call her. Marise. Marise. I like to say her name. Then say all of it, Marise Aubert, that's her name. - Marise Aubert. - Alright. You've told me that before, I know she's your wife. My girl from Paris. Born and brought up there. You wouldn't think she'd fit in As a fisherman's wife, would you? 'But she did.' 'She was so happy.' - 'You know, that she was?' - 'I'd stake my life on it.' 'She loved my people. They loved her too.' 'As soon as they got used to her funny little ways.' There was one thing they didn't understand for a while. She had no use for keys, always forgot to lock the doors. "If they are friends, we don't want them out," she said. "If they are enemies, let them come in." "We'll make friends of them." She trusted people... everyone. You trust her, don't you, Aubert? Five years away? You're still sure of her? As I am of God. Yes, I'm sure of Marise. As sure as I am that someday, someday I'll be going back home. (Paul narrating) Home, under my own flag. To my own country, Brittany. Where I was born and my father and his father before him. I'll go along the road I know so well. Yes, so well. And all at once, there will be that wonderful sea coast. The place where you turn off the road. Our way to the house. I'll be on my own ground once more. I'll look down at the whirlpool, always changing Yet always the same, since I was a boy. From there I can see the path. I'll start down. A little way and I'll come to the shrine. It's been there forever I guess. As long as I remember, anyhow. Marise never passed it without touching it. For luck. (Jean) Then? (Paul) When I get to the beach, I'll look up. And there will be our house. Now, think, as I always do When I've been away for a while It looks lonely. It never was though. Not for me. Not after I brought her there. Not that we had many visitors. The village priest sometimes. Postman almost every day. He was an old friend named Alex. Knew everybody. And everybody's business too. Oh, Alex. Hello! How are ya? Hello. Who are you? [Instrumental music] (Paul) She'd always forget to lock the door. "If they're friends, we don't want to keep them out" She said. "If they're enemies, why then... let them in." "We'll make friends of them." She trusted people. Everyone. Marise? The cottage was very old and simple. Full of pleasant things. Some mine, some hers. She promised there'd be nothing changed. Don't matter how long the war lasted. We were proud of the piano. It'd been my mothers. She used to teach the children of Kergat on it In the old days. My chair stood by the fire. She sent to Paris for it. It was comfortable. Big enough for both of us. [Instrumental music] [Sighing] Ah. Ah, ha ha ha. The kitchen was always scrubbed And full of good smells. Only one thing wrong. There was a gas jet that whistled. She was going to do something about that but... She never did. [Gas jet whistling] [Music continues] [Piano music] [Music continues] Paul! I knew you weren't dead. Oh, no. I thought you were Paul. I thought you were my husband. Why did you think that? That song... How did you come to know that song? I've heard it often enough. Your song, Marise. My name, you know that too. Why shouldn't I? I've said it often enough, over and over. [Whispering] Marise. Marise. Yes, I know your names, I know this house. The chair by the fire, the piano. The gas jet in the kitchen. 'Glad you didn't fix that, Marise.' [Thunder rumbling] The weather this time of year, that's an old friend too. Rain at night, bright sky in the morning. Even that dress your wearing. One you bought in Morley. "Expensive," you said, "but good quality." [Instrumental music] Who are you? Does my name matter? Why did you come here? How do you know these things? Paul told you. You know Paul? I knew him. Knew him? Don't say it... As if... As if he were... I wont believe that. No, it's not true. They sent me papers and... And documents and... I tell you, I wont believe it. I saw him die, Marise. [Thunder rumbling] I'm sorry. They... They said he was killed Trying to escape from the reprisal camp. Go on. Tell me exactly how it happened. It won't be easy for you. Paul lived for one thing. To get away, to get back to you. He worked out a plan for an escape. It was a long chance but he was ready for it. So were some of the rest of us. And when the time came... I found myself next to Paul. Crawling towards the barbed wire. Just the two of us. Cut off from the rest. At first, luck was with us. We thought we'd made it. And then... [Men speaking foreign language] [Dramatic music] [Men speaking foreign language] [Grunting] [Speaking foreign language] [Gunshot] [Whistle blaring] [Gunshot] [Thunder rumbling] If only he hadn't tried to come back to me. Do you hate me, Marise, because I had all the luck? Why should I hate you? You have a right to your luck. To your life. [Instrumental music] [Sobbing] Don't cry. [Crying] Paul. [Sobbing] Paul. Marise... [Music continues] [Sobbing] Thank you for coming here... And telling me. I didn't come here for that. I came here because I fell in love with a woman I'd never met. With you, Marise. In the camps, a man has to find something to hold on to Something to keep him sane. With Paul, it was you. Talking about you. And he talked to me, Marise. And it kept me sane too. Don't, soldier. This is Paul's house. And Paul's wife? But Paul is dead, Marise. And life belongs to the ones who are left. When Paul talked, he shared you with me. He didn't know that, but he did. If could have guessed what he was doing maybe He would have stopped, but he didn't guess. So you became mine too. Oh, yes, you were there with me as well as with him And I kept myself alive as he did To get back to you. Don't talk that way. It's wrong. - I won't listen - Why? Are you afraid to listen? Has the waiting been long for you too? Or have you waited, Marise? I've waited... For Paul. For Paul. That first night you came here. The curtains were open then too. The beam from the lighthouse touched you, and then... No, no, don't! [Instrumental music] I'm remembering, Marise. Help me to remember. You have no right to remember these things. Please go, now, soldier. Please. [Music continues] [Thunder rumbling] Paul said this door was never locked. Against anyone. "If they're friends, we don't want to keep them out" You said. "If they're enemies... well, then let them in. We'll make friends of them." Wait. You know I can't let you go out there. I hoped you couldn't send me away, Marise. You can sleep here tonight. But in the morning you must go. Goodnight, Marise. Goodnight. [Instrumental music] (Paul narrating) She said she'd hide the tin of English tobacco away. And when I came back, she'd have it ready for me. There in the jar, on the fireplace. [Instrumental music] [Crying] Jean! 'Jean, help me!' Jean! Jean! Help me! 'Jean! Help me!' 'Jean!' [Marise sobbing] [Instrumental music] Paul. [Sighing] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Train whistle blaring] [Music continues] Paul. Paul. [Window creaking] [Birds chirping] [Instrumental music] [Music continues] - Good morning. - Good morning. That dress you have on is the one I like best. It was Paul's favorite too. Marise... I heard you crying in the night, I... I'm afraid I didn't tell you the way I should have. Well, it's alright. It's morning now. Yes, it's morning. You said I was to go, didn't you? If I frightened you, I'm sorry about that too. But you must understand how it was with me. I didn't want to share another man's life anymore, I... I wanted to live it myself. I wanted to know what it was... What it was like to come home to my own house. My own wife. Can you understand that, Marise? Yes, I think I can... When one is lonely. Where are you from, soldier? Where's your home? Paris. Mormant. And you, you're from Montparnasse. You know that too. I know you very well, Marise. Better than anyone alive knows you. You say that about me and... Yet I don't even know your name. Jean. Jean Renaud. Well, you've no place to go, Jean? Is there no one... No woman waiting for you? No, no one. I'm alone, like you, Marise. But your old life? Nothing to go back to. I'm glad you came here. You were Paul's friend. His friend? I don't know, Marise. Can you call a man friend, or... One minute your comrades and the next You're at each other's throat. It was like that with all of us in that place. He must have trusted you. He couldn't have talked to you... Well, he did, 'cause he trusted you. So I trust you too. You'll want to rest and-and, uh Few days to get on your feet, make some plans. Paul would want me to help you too. Oh, it's not quite all like that. I'm being little selfish too. 'Cause you're right about one thing. I am alone. You're never so alone as when you're waiting. Well, the waiting's over now and it's time I was of some little use in the world again. I think Paul would want that too. So you're welcome to stay here a little while, Jean. As Paul's friend, you're welcome in Paul's home. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Hello, Emile. Beginning to look like old times, eh? [Speaking foreign language] - A whole loaf? - Yes, please. It's a pleasure to see you looking yourself again, madam. Thank you. A whole loaf. - Instead of the usual half. - Now, now. Who's going to eat the other half do you think? That's not my business or yours. [Music continues] Hello, Alex. - Good morning, mademoiselle. - Good morning, Monsieur Martin. - Could you give me a moment? - Why, yes, of course. I think I found a buyer for your husbands business. (Marise) 'Oh, so soon?' I hope you haven't changed your mind. Now that the fishermen are out again There's no one to manage for them Or to take care of their catch. Thank you for your trouble. - May I let you know later? - Go ahead. Uh, I'm glad to see you're looking so well today. Thank you. No wonder she's looking so fine. [Inaudible] Alex, you shouldn't spread gossip. I? I only know what the good ladies tell me. You know how it is when a fancy new hen Is put in with the old brown ones. Cackle, cackle, cackle. - Good morning, Father Donnard. - Good morning, Alex. [Instrumental music] Jean? Oh, Jean. Jean? [Music continues] Jean! Where did you learn how to catch shrimp? I'm just learning now. Come on down. Come on! 'You're afraid of getting wet?' [Music continues] [Music continues] I have something special to show you, Jean. 'Look, this is my own private pool.' I found it the first summer I was here. But the-there's something about it that I haven't Told anyone before. Not-not even Paul? Not even Paul. Why not? I was afraid he might laugh. At what? Why? I don't know whether I should tell you or not. I won't laugh. Well, then... It's a singing pool. - Singing pool? - Yes, and when it sings it... It tells you things. Wait and see. You'll hear it. If you listen long enough. There, do you hear anything? I hear the ocean and the wind. Nothing more? There. There's a kind of music. Yes. That's what I mean. Stronger now. Shh. It must be the play of the wind And the sound of the sea through these rocks. Yes, I expected something like that. Makes a kind of... hum. Sometimes you hear it better over there And sometimes better here. Now I know something Paul didn't know. Carrot top. - Marise. - Yes, Jean? It's been a good day, hasn't it? We've had a good day together. A fine day. - I've been almost... - Happy? It's been... easier. Has it, Marise? Is that wrong? Tell me. Is it wrong? Do you feel that it is? I don't know, Jean. I don't know. [Instrumental music] There. Now just try and tell that those aren't The best shrimps you ever tasted. Ah. It brings Mormant right back to me. Mormant or Montparnasse? All of Paris. You know, Jean? It's no fun to cook when... When you're alone? Mm-hmm. I'll tell you another thing. You don't care much about eating either when you're worried, so... You don't cook, you don't eat... You don't live. - Well... - That was what you meant. You're not eating. Here. Look at me, Marise. Now, uh, smile again. With your eyes too. You're eyes show what's in your heart. There, that's better. Not good enough, but better. [Instrumental music] [Piano music] [Laughing] Why don't you play this, Marise? [Piano music] No, Jean. Not that one. You'll play it for me someday, Marise. No, Jean. [Piano music] [Instrumental music] Let go! Oh, Jean... oh, put me down. Okay, fine. Oh, put me down... I had a wonderful day. (Father Donnard) 'Good morning, Marise.' Good morning. Good morning, father. This is Jean Renaud, father. He was with Paul in prison camp. Ah, so you've come because you are Paul's friend. Hardly, father. So you knew Paul Aubert. You were privileged, my son. He was that rare a thing, a man liked by everyone. Rich and poor, wicked and pious. He was also the best fisherman in Kergat. The good women of the town were quite put out When he brought Marise back from Paris with him. Hey, my child? I see. For once, the fisherman was the catch. Father, may we offer you a glass of wine? Please, will you sit down, father? Only for a moment. This is a busy day for me. And early tomorrow morning I go to the neighboring villages 'In Giles for the pardons.' The "pardons?" That's what we call these festivals here. The people from all over the countryside journey Someone-for some by boat to one of the shrines To obtain the intersession of a saint And bring the blessing of God into their households. Oh, yes, I've heard about the pardons. And afterwards, they drink a lot of wine Dance all day and make love all night. I don't like your implication, my son. The church doesn't expect to change human nature by ritual. And what's more natural than friends meeting And enjoying themselves after the services. And making love? Many couples are honorably betrothed At our religious festivals. And that too is natural and fitting. I don't know your plans, but if you're staying in Kergat Can I help you find a place to live? I'm used to taking care of myself, thank you, father. Goodbye, my child. I'll go a little way with you, father. Thank you, Marise. Goodbye, father. 'Marise, wouldn't it be more sensible' 'To change your wet clothes?' [Instrumental music] I know why you're crying even if you don't. - It's because I'm so ashamed. - Oh, no. That's not it. It's because he spoiled something by coming here. What did you mean by acting as if I were... Your wife, as if this were your house? You're trying to make him think you had the right? You would have been in my arms if it hadn't been for him. Don't say that, don't think it or I'll... Or you'll do what? Tell me to go? - I'm sorry, but... - Of course you're sorry! Women love to pity. Especially men who'll fetch and carry for them And be tamed as a dog about the house But I don't want your pity, thank you! - You'll get no more of it. - That's good! - But before you go... - Oh, I am to go, eh? Of course. Don't you think you'll miss me, Marise? Look at yourself. That's the face of a woman who's alive. You didn't look like that the first night I saw you. Even those tears in your eyes Are happier than the one I saw then. What's made the change? Ah, you've been alone long enough With your thoughts of Paul? But he's dead now and I'm not gonna let you die with him. You were his friend. Something... Something overflowed from him to you. If there's been any change at all, it's because of that. If you seemed to belong in my life these last few days And I belonged in yours It's because of that. You're only here because of Paul. Only because of Paul? I suppose I've... needed someone to talk with and... To be with... I've liked you being here. But it was wrong. I was wrong. [Instrumental music] Marise, wait. If you knew the way I feel, you wouldn't be angry. Once when the police were chasing me And some other kids through the streets in Paris I came to a church. I ran in to hide. I even pretended to be praying. Then suddenly I was praying. Me! I didn't want to go back to thieving in the alleys I wanted to stay. And that's the way I feel now. You're the chance I want. The chance I need to be different. Better! Oh, don't send me away. I'd miss staying near you. For a little while. Just a little while longer. [Music continues] [Sighing] Oh, Jean... Yes. Stay. Let's go to the pardons tomorrow, Marise. Why? Why does anyone go to the pardons except to ask pardon. [Music continues] Yes. I should go. Why do you want to go? Perhaps to... pray. Perhaps to dance with you afterwards. [Music continues] [People singing in foreign language] [Singing continues] Marise. Marise, it's like a holiday When-when all Paris is... [Dramatic music] [Singing continues] It is a holiday, but different from any you've seen in Paris. Oh, postman did come today. What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, look. 'That should please you.' [All cheering] [Dog barking] Look at the sheep. They're on their way to be blessed. I have been blessed already today. I'm going to the pardons with you. This is the first pardon since the war. Seems as if the day were blessed too. [Singing continues] Marise, let's go buy a boat too. - Buy a boat? - Why not? There must be something in the boathouse we can use. Oh, Jean. I haven't been inside Paul's boathouse for so long. Somehow I-I find it hard to unlock the door. Well, then, it's time someone made you do it. Remember, it's wrong to be unhappy. Here's the key. [Singing continues] It doesn't look the way it used to. Well, here's a row boat that looks easy enough to handle. [Door creaking] Jean! What's the matter? How odd that his door opened by itself. No door opens by itself. This one did. It did. Then there must be a window open somewhere making a draft. I'll see. [Dramatic music] Jean? Jean, what was it? Just an open window, Marise. Nothing to be worried about. No, no. It's more than that. Paul's here. What? He's... he's everywhere here. Nonsense. You're-you're just imagining things. Y-yes, I suppose I am. It-it's true in a sense, Paul is here. No, I... I can't sell this place, Jean. Paul wouldn't want strangers in here Running his business for him. He'd sooner have you. What about that, Jean? This could be a good life for you. Good future. I can't walk in Paul's shoes any longer. I don't want to stay where Paul's been Where everything reminds you of him. But yesterday you begged to stay. What's changed you? Nothing. Something has. Let's go away from here. To Paris. Oh, don't look as if I had said something crazy. You told me you planned to go back To Paris yourself, didn't you? You know you don't belong here anymore than I do. There're jobs there. I'll get one and keep it. This place is haunted. You'll never be happy here. Come with me Marise. Someday I suppose I... I'll be leaving here. It's not my country anymore. But-but not now. No, Jean, I can't come with you. Then stay here with your ghost! Live in the past if you like! I'm going to Paris. - You mean you're leaving? - Now. - Today? - The sooner the better. Then-then we're not going to the pardons? No, I'm not. Here's your key back. Oh, Jean, you know how to be cruel, don't you? Maybe, but not so cruel as you. Goodbye, Marise. [People singing in foreign language] [Singing continues] [Bell tolling] [Man singing in foreign language] [All singing in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] [Instrumental music] [Singing in foreign language] Thought you were gone for good. I thought so too. Found I couldn't. [Instrumental music] [All cheering] [Music continues] Here you are, ladies and gentlemen, here you are! Spinning Tantalizing Wheel Of Chance! Watch a few francs grow into a fortune. Fill your pockets with this magic gold! That's right, young fellow. Let your pretty sweetheart try her luck. 'Fortune smiles on red heads.' Let's try our luck. We're taking all sorts of chances tonight. You can win a lot taking chances. [Dramatic music] (Marise) 'What is it?' I thought I saw someone I knew, but it wasn't. Now let's try the wheel. I feel luck's with me. Here you are! The Spinning Tantalizing Wheel Of Chance! - Uh, thank you. - Goodnight, sir. - Now here's... - How much is this? - Well, 45 francs, sir. - Alright, I'll give you 35. No, no, no. I couldn't possibly sell it for that. - Well, we'll make it 40. - Alright, thank you. Forty francs, sir. Alas! You have me fight the devil! [Screaming] [Instrumental music] Oh, Jean, what's this? Real pearls as pink as your cheeks. Oh, as cool as the sea. - Thank you, Jean. - Thank the Wheel Of Chance. Now let's dance. [Instrumental music] The latest from Paris. - Pretty lady? - From Paris? From Paris. Oh, you should see yourself. Look. Soldier, five Francs, please. Oh. Thanks. [Indistinct chatter] [Dramatic music] - Where were you? - I dropped something. Important? Oh, secrets, eh? Well, I thought we were gonna dance. [Instrumental music] [Marise singing in foreign language] (Marise) 'I thought I'd forgotten how to dance.' Do you know why I came back today? No, Jean. [Instrumental music] Now do you know? Did that tell you why? - Please. - It told me something too. You wanted me to come back. - No, Jean. - Yes, Marise. You wanted me back and when I leave again You'll go with me. You'll go with me. [Music continues] [Train whistle blaring] [Instrumental music] This is where my part of the coast begins. Smell that air. Did you ever breathe anything like it? Sounds like a man going home. You're right. After five years. Three days ago, I was in a hospital. And now, breathing my own air I can lift up one of my boats with one hand. [Laughing] There's the lighthouse. Kergat Lights. Oh, it's guided me home safely past these rocks many times. [Instrumental music] Well, there they are. One day, she won't sell anything. The next, it's all on the market And she's leaving on the first train. I hear it's the soldier that's changed her mind. You're going to bid on Aubert's business? Hm, yes. I'm-I'm due there now. - Gossips will miss her. - So shall we all. [Chuckling] Well, I hope you won't let sentiment Keep you from driving a good bargain. No doubt. Or from finishing my coffee. [Instrumental music] All the records are here. Just as he left them. What's this doing here? Oh, that's a keepsake. Belonged to Paul's father. Probably useless. Sea air is not good for guns. Somehow, I never thought I'd find myself selling this place. But what would we do with boats and paddles? [Music continues] And I'm sorry we're going. And I'm sorry you belong with me now. Do I belong with you, Jean? For the rest of your life. It means so much to you then? So much? Listen to me, Marise. I'll never let you get away from me. Remember that. No matter what happens. [Sighing] What could happen? Well, you know... You could talk some more about hating to sell this place. You could go on keeping ghosts alive. But, Jean, my memories of Paul take nothing away from you. Well, I won't share you. [Music continues] We'll make our own memories. We'll start by getting rid of this. Oh, no, no, Jean. No. I didn't know that Paul had kept it. Ah, don't be angry. [Sighing] It's no good to hold on to the past. Jean, when we finish here Would you come over to Father Donnard with me? Why? His blessing would mean a great deal to me. Why not, then? There's no reason why the good priest Shouldn't give us his blessing And why we shouldn't take it. You're not a religious man, are you? Only frightened people are religious. That's not true. Don't say it. Alright, it's not true. I won't say it. [Music continues] [Instrumental music] Hello? Hello, there! Come on up. I'm late. I confess I didn't miss you. Hector Martin, Jean Renaud. Oh, yes. I've heard of you. The sharpest businessman in Kergat, they say. I've heard of you. Well, I've come prepared to set a price. I'm sure it'll be a fair one, Hector. I'm glad that you're the buyer. You knew Paul and-and you'll run the business the way that... Hector, would you mind settling all this with Jean Renaud Instead of with me? I've been over everything with him. An-and, Jean, if you'll forgive me, I'll meet you over At Father Donnard's. Of course, Marise. Thank you. - Good morning, Hector. - Mademoiselle. [Instrumental music] It's all here. Just what we have to offer. A good business for someone. Yes, it took Paul Aubert a long time to make it there. A very long time. And much work. Well... You'll expect to pay well for that effort, eh? Thank you. - Good morning, father. - Oh. Good morning, my child. Well, sit down. Thank you. Father, I've been going through some of Paul's belongings And I found this. And I want you to have it. Oh. I think Paul would want that too. Oh, thank you, Marise. [Dog barking] I shall cherish it. You're sure of yourself, Marise? And you're sure of this soldier? You know my plans then? Kergat is a small town, my dear. I repeat, are you sure? Father... No man could ever take Paul's place with me. [Instrumental music] But I've been so lonely. I need someone to need me. Jean does. And I need him, father. Someone to... 'Someone to do for and care about... 'Once more.' [Music continues] 'And to care about me.' 'A new life, father.' 'Not as good as the old one, I know that.' 'But at least... a life of some kind.' [Music continues] Paul. Paul Aubert? That's right. [Instrumental music] Paul. Under all this, you'll find Paul Aubert. You, is it possible? The report came. It was official. "Killed trying to escape," it said. No, we forged. The wall was full of reports. All I know is I woke up in a hospital instead of a coffin. - Welcome home. - Thanks. You tell the men I'm back. Tell 'em to get their boats in shape right away. First, I've gotta get home. [Music continues] Home. You know what that word can mean to a man, Martin? [Music continues] And I was afraid I'd never pass this way again. Marise? Marise! [Instrumental music] Marise! Marise! Marise? [Music continues] [Music continues] No, my child, it isn't wrong for you to reach for happiness. But are you happy, Marise? Your face doesn't tell me that you are. [Knocking on door] Come. Your pardon, father. Madame Aubert, there's something you must know. This is very difficult for me and I... - Yes, Hector. - He's here. I saw him. As I live, I saw him walking down the street As if he'd never been away. Just the same, except for the uniform He spoke of the men, the boats. Who, Hector, who was it? Your husband, Paul. - Paul! - He's on his way home now. I left him a moment ago. Paul alive? I should never have stop believing! [Foghorn blaring] [Foghorn blaring] Good morning. Where's Marise? She was to wait here for me. Come in, my son. I want to talk to you. If Marise has been here There's nothing for us to say to each other. 'I think there is.' 'Sit down.' - You don't trust me, do you? - I don't know you. I wish I did. Well, if it's the story of my life you're after It's not very interesting from your standpoint. I'm only a small sailor. Nothing worth your while. At the moment, I'd rather hear of your virtues. Oh, that's an even shorter list. I was born in Paris, that's a virtue. I live there, another virtue. I worked a little, oh, great virtue that. I went to war, I fought... That is I fought when they let me I was in a prison camp for almost five years. I escaped, I met Marise, I want to marry her. - Virtues, all. - Go on. I love Marise. That's a word I used to laugh at. [Foghorn blaring] Do you believe that I love her, father? I believe that you believe it. Then, what else is important? There are many kinds of love. Some good, some bad. - What kind is your's, my son? - What do you mean? If it's a good love, you go away at once, you leave Kergat. I intend to go tonight with Marise. No, my son, without her. Where I go, from now on, she goes too? Paul Aubert is alive. I have a feeling you knew that. You did? What makes you think so? Alright, I won't deny it. I did know it. Paul Aubert is here. In Kergat. He's home and his wife has gone to him. 'Be grateful, that he came back in time.' Grateful? Yes, I am grateful. Why not? I'd rather face a man than a ghost. 'My son... [Foghorn blaring] [Dramatic music] [Foghorn blaring] [Foghorn blaring] - Paul! - Marise! Marise. Carrot top. Hold me, just for a little. Kiss me, just once more. Once more? A hundred times more, without stopping. - What's wrong, Marise? - I shouldn't have listened. - Listened? - To anyone. Why? What is it? I should've known you were still alive. I should've kept on believing. Does it make so much difference then? It makes all the difference, Paul. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to tell you. It's not a new story, these days. No, it isn't. But it's a story I thought I'd never hear. Not from you, Marise. Go on, go on. Paul, it was someone who knew you. - Who could tell me about you. - Go on. He knew you in the camp. He told me how... how you were shot down trying to escape. I never believed you were dead until then. Nor all that time without word, not even when the report came That you were killed. Our life together here, went on in this house. That's how I was able to stay on here, waiting for you. Waiting for you. Until he came. And told me that he saw you die. I had to believe it then. There was no way of knowing that it wasn't true. But you are still alive. Yes, I'm alive. Doesn't seem to matter much now that I am, does it? Why didn't you let me know, Paul? Why didn't you write? Write? I did write as soon as I could, from the hospital. - When? - Two weeks ago. I had no letter. No word. Nothing. Are you in love with this man, Marise? Love? With what was left of me, I-I felt sorry for him. He seemed so lost, and I was lonely. And me? What did you feel for me? Paul, I love you. But with you gone, what did anything matter? I stopped believing you were alive And I promised to marry another man. I'll go away from here now, it's the only thing for me to do. No, you're my wife, this is your home. No, not any longer. Not mine. I haven't the right. Paul, Paul, what'll I do? 'What'll I do?' I used to wonder what I'd do if a thing like this happened. I thought I'd want to kill you. I don't. Not you, Marise. I'd rather be dead, than hurt you. Who is he, Marise? Tell me, who is it? No, Paul, names don't matter. I think they do, who is he? Renaud, Jean Renaud. - How long has he been here? - A week. Perhaps, a little longer. Maybe my letter did come. Maybe Renaud stole it. You think Jean would steal? He was a thief and coward in camp Why shouldn't he be a thief and coward here? - Where is he? - I don't know. Don't lie to me, Marise. He's in Kergat, isn't he? You wouldn't be so frightened if he were out of my reach. Well, there aren't many places he can hide. Wait, Paul, let me go and see, and let me send him away. Why don't you want me to find him? Are you afraid for him? No, for you, Paul, of what you might do. I'll ask him one question, Marise. Just one. Did he know that I was alive. Most people aren't strong like you, Paul. Most of us are weak. I told you I couldn't send him away, but you didn't ask me why. And that's important. He didn't seem like a stranger. He seemed to belong here. He knew about us, Paul. Things that only you could've told him. If I told him too much about you It was only the way a man might talk about his religion To another who had none. You shared our life with him, Paul. You shared me. He was only coming back to something That he believed was his own. You can't kill a man for believing what's wrong When you yourself taught him to believe it. Give him a chance. He is in Kergat. He'll come here. Give him a chance. Alright, when he comes, I'll ask him one question. Just one. You're tired. I'll get you some coffee. [Wind howling] [Foghorn blaring] (Marise) 'I won't be a minute, Paul' [Foghorn blaring] [Wind howling] [Foghorn blaring] [Branches cracking] Who's there? It's your friend Renaud. You came back a little too soon, old bear. 'In another hour, we'd have been gone.' [Foghorn blaring] [Gunshot] Paul! Paul! [Foghorn blaring] (Paul) I did have one question to ask you, Renaud. I don't have to ask it now. [Gunshot] You never were a good shot. [Gunshot] [Foghorn blaring] (Marise) 'Paul!' [Gunshot] When all the bullets are gone, what will you do then? [Foghorn blaring] Are you waiting for me, Renaud? 'You gone as far as you can?' [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Man screaming] Aaah! [Sobbing] [Foghorn blaring] [Bell tolling] (Dr. Leclair) The only cure for this sickness Lies within you, Marise, within you. You can either learn and grow from what has happened to you Or you can be destroyed. The choice is yours. Yours, Marise. (Marise) A man died, because of me. (Dr. Leclair) No, Marise. Not because of you. That man was so formed, so deformed by life. That what he did was part of his pattern. The pattern he was forced into by a society Which, which sends its children out into the streets To lie and thieve in order to live. Remember this, the only happiness Jean ever had He had through you. He came closest to redemption through you. Go back to him, Marise. Go back to man you love And who loves you. Go into his arms, naturally, gladly Freely as you did once. Help him to build his life again. Go on together, Marise. Together. [Instrumental music] [Music continues]
