Good work with the report last week, mate. Edison's transfer account? Sorry. Wake up, pretty boy. I'm trying to pay you a fucking compliment, mate. Huh? You know, Harry. If you spent some time working rather than doing the rounds maculating your employees, this office might be taken seriously. Yeah, no one's talking to you, Blu. Beer on me tonight, huh? - Okay. - That's the spirit. Honestly, well done on that account, mate. Brass balls, eh? Oh, hi, Daniel. - Morning Chris. - How are you? - I'm good, thanks. How are you? - Good. - Glad it's Friday. - Yes. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Thank you. Oh, by the way, mate, congratulations on that transfer account. - Thank you. - Honestly, it's good work. Thanks. So how are you finding the place? Yeah, it's, um, it's good. Yeah, everyone's friendly, and I'm enjoying the work. Good. Good, I'm glad. - Uh, here you go. - Thank you. Uh, look, if you ever need anything, here's my card. Thanks. Your welcome. Have a nice day. Yeah, you, too. - congratulations! - Thanks. So I guess you're going to be staying here longer then? - It looks that way. - Cool. - Chris is nice. - Oy, yeah. He's lovely. Unlike Harry. You just have to ignore him. He's like that with everyone. Talking of the devil, I need to make him a cup of coffee. - Yeah, back to work. - Yeah. Oh, Dan? - Oh, thank you. - No, worries, "brass balls." - Hey. - Hey. Danny boy. Everything alright, mate? - Yeah. - Uh-huh? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, see you out there, mate. - Alright? - Yeah. Sorry, can you spare me? Thanks. Cheers, mate. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Am I, uh, interrupting? So... What do you think? Hm? Girl in there? Yeah, she's nice. She is. Who are you fucking then? Go on, who are you fucking? - No one. - No one? You've been in London, what, three months? You need to get laid, mate. You need to get laid. Hey, hey, hey. I'm just joking, I'm just joking. But... I need you around, mate. Okay, come on. Come on. - Give us two minutes. - Alright. Okay. I'll see you in there, alright? Lover boy, right? Lover boy. Daniel! Daniel. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you? - Yeah. - You look nice. - Thanks. So do you. So why are you sneaking out? How did you know I was doing that? I was spying on you from across the road. I'm joking. I just wanted to hide from the new lot and sat here with a friend at the bar. Oh, okay. There's my ride. Do you want to join us for a dance and drink? Uh, I need to get back, but next time. - Thanks for the offer. - Well, if you want to come, address is on the back. See ya. Hi, this is Daniel Reed. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now. Leave a name, number, and a brief message, I'll get back to you. Dan, it's me. I've been meaning to find something. Look, I know it's a couple of months since it all happened, and well... I just want to try and sort things out between us. It'll be your mum's birthday next week. I think it's the right time. Remember that time when you were seven, we had that day at the beach. I found the old video. I miss her, Daniel. I miss you, too. Your mum always understood you better than I did. The door's always open. Good morning, handsome. Let me guess, "Where am I? What did I do? How did I get here?" Yeah, something like that. You know, you were a hit in there earlier. It's okay to be one of the lost ones. You don't have to be lost forever. Thanks. - Daniel. - I know. Jennifer. - Thanks for the cig. - It's yours. Oh. See you. See you soon. - Hey, you. - Hey. Brought you some breakfast. Do you want to come in? How do you know where I live, Blu? You told me last night, stupid. Last night? Lost and Found? Sugar? Daniel? No, thanks. Why are you here, Blu? Tonight's your big night. I can't remember last night, I was so drunk. Shut up and eat your breakfast. Everything's fine. Hey, Jen. You okay? Look can you get there early tonight? - I'm going to be late. - Yeah, that's fine. How's Daniel? Yeah, he's fine. I've made sure he's got everything he needs, so it's all good. Good. Well, take care of it, would you? - Yeah. - Good. - Okay, love you. - Love you. Love you, bye! Who was that? - Jen. - Jen? Yeah, I, um... Whatever I said to you last night... I... I was joking. Do you seriously don't remember last night? Daniel, it's fine. I'm not going to treat this like a joke like those twats at the office. Look, it's okay. I think you should leave. Daniel, it's fine. - I understand. - You understand? Just go, please. Please. Daniel, it's me. Um, I just want to try and sort things out between us. Your mum always understood you better than I did. I miss her, Daniel. And I miss you, too. The door's always open. You don't have to be lost forever. Can I help you? Yeah, I've come to speak to Blu. I think you should leave right now. No, no, no. I know Blu. I work with her. This is Lost and Found, right? Look, I was here last night. I've got a Lost and Found card. There she is. Thank you. Blu? - Hey. - Daniel. I needed to come and say that I'm really sorry I shouted... Daniel, it's fine. Everything I said last night to you... You don't need to explain yourself. I understand. Good luck. Hi, Daniel. You're covered I see. Yeah, that was a... A wild night. Yeah. You're always welcomed here. You're part of the family now. Thank you. See you soon. Hey, Dad. Bye-bye. - Good morning, Daniel. - Hi, Jan. How are you? I'm well, thank you. And you? I'm good, thank you. - What time is it? - It is 10 past eight. Ten past eight, thank you. Hey, cheeky chops! Morning. Jan. Jan! Jan! - Oh, thank god it's Friday. - Yeah. That's a really lovely dress by the way. Oh, thank you. I only got it yesterday. Have a nice day. You, too. Have a lovey day, Daniel. He's a nice boy, isn't he, cheeky chops? What do you think? You were smiling, right? I haven't seen you smile like that for a while. Not for me anyway. - Save it, Harry. - Well, don't you like him? Don't worry, we all do. Your post is on your desk. Alright, did you open it? Yeah, right. Well, you know what? I was working. Uh, Blu, coffee. You either evolve, or you fucking die, yeah. Evolve or die, I've said it to you before. Alright, you think about that. Danny boy. Drinks tonight, nine o'clock. And no sneaking away. No sneaking off like last time. What? What are you on? Evening, ladies. Evening, Gingee. I said, evening ladies! Evening, Gingee! Okay, Jen, how's it going? I don't know. I think I'm just about done. Why, how do I look? There are no words. And that is why I love you. - Daniel. - Sorry. Daniel, wait. I can't even walk in these, and my wig... And I just feel so... You look fantastic. Really? Daniel. You know, I've kept this in all these years. I don't... I've never told anyone. Itâ€™s that one person. And she understood. I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm telling you this... I'm just really scared. It's okay. These things take time. Oh, god. I'm sorry. Look at you. You're here! Not everyone feels comfortable the first time. You make a beautiful young woman. Showtime. Daniel. Oh, Danny. Hello? Hello? I was like you once. She's proud. Follow this path, and don't get lost.
