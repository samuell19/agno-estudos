For now, yes. - I can't do that. - You can't? - But it's easy. - For you it is. - Do like this... - They know about the baby? Yeah, I told them. I should be able to take a week. That's why at the beginning it'll be a bit... tense. I'll do stuff... We can go to the woods... Can we go tomorrow? Tomorrow I can't. But we'll go this weekend. With mum?

"and a monstrous bear with unkempt hair... "appeared. "His brilliant black eyes rested on Mowgli." - Hey, hello. - Hello. - How's it going? - Fine. You're looking for the others?

When I was little, I also sucked my thumb. And when you do it again later it's really weird. It doesn't work anymore. Hold on, little monkey. Stop moving. I'm making your eyes brown.

We can stick together. It's nice, eh? Yeah. I'm going out. I'll go play with Lisa. You said you were staying with me. But I didn't know she was going to invite me. Can I go too then? No, you can't. When are you coming back? Around six. Draw me a clock so I know. Common, let's dance! Common! What's that? We're going to make you up. - Into what? - Into a girl! Close your eyes. Tomorrow we'll go swim with the others. I don't know if I'm going. Open your eyes. Can't you swim? Yeah, I can swim. Don't put on too much. That suits you very well. You look good as a girl. Laure? Can you come see me? I have to do something first. Common, come see me. Are you alright, dear? You have makeup on! You look good like that. It suits you Yes, it suits you well. What are you doing? It's modeling clay. Will you make me spaghetti? I don't want to. Please? No. Hey! I'll make spaghetti. Can you give me the purple thing? What are you doing? Nothing. Oh! Can you help me? Wait. Okay, that's it. What are you doing? It's none of your business. What are you doing? I already told you, I'm not going to tell you. You're not nice. That's good guys. Go to the end.

Alright then, bye. Bye. What are you doing in the hallway, darling? - Are you bored? - No. There were a lot of people. Lisa was looking for you. She was looking for Mickäel. Why did you do that? I didn't do anything. You made her believe you're a boy. Shut up. - I'm going to tell mum. - No, you won't say anything. - Shh! - Hum! Wait, wait. Shh! If I take you, you won't say anything? I'll take you every day, okay? What's your name? Jeanne. And you? I'm Cheyenne. - That's nice. - How old are you? Six. I'm five and a half. Yeah? What class are you in? First grade. Me too. We're going to the same school. Oh cool, I already went. I haven't. You know the teacher's name? Yes, her name is Sylvie. What do your parents do? Dad works on the computer. And mum doesn't work, she has a big belly. Because she's pregnant. Do you have a brother or a sister? A big sister. I have a big brother. I think that's better. Why is it better? A big brother can defend you. One time, my brother beat up these boys who were bothering me. He punched them because they were making fun of me. That was at our old house. We were in a bad neighbourhood. Everyone was scared of him, and all the girls loved him. But he didn't love anyone but me. Hey, Jeanne. Did you see? I came with my big brother Don't cut too much. Yeah. - And cut straight. - I know, I'm not stupid. When I'm older, I'll be a hairdresser. What are you doing? Hello ma'am. Want one? Yeah. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Good, don't say anything at dinner. Keep your mouth shut, okay? Yes. Don't mess it up, eh? Go on Jeanne, it'll get cold. Not hungry? But you were feeling well today, right? - She went out with Laure. - Oh yeah? That's good, what did you do? - Well? Did you have fun? - Yes. That's it? Cat got your tongue? Let's see? Oh, that's good. We had a water fight. That's fun. They were afraid of me, I was aiming too well. That's nice of them to play with you. Yes, but Mickäel is my favourite. Laure's friend. He played with me, and gave me a piggy-back ride. And now, he's my friend. The class lists are posted. I checked them out. - You’ll go to 2nd grade? - Yeah. I didn't see your name. That's weird, there's only one class. Maybe I'm not registered yet. Because I just moved. It's good we're together. Yeah, that's good. It's nothing. I barely touched her, she fell. What happened? She fell? No, he pushed her. - Him? - Yeah, him Why did you push my sister? She's annoying. Common. Give him a good kick. Go! Kick. Stop. Let me go. Does that sting? No, I'm brave. - Shall I put a band-aid on? - Yeah. You were so strong, when you beat him up. You just make a fist, close your eyes... and then you hit. It's easy. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. - What is it? - I don't know. I saw him come here... He told me he was in a fight in the woods. - Yes, I didn't see. - I don't know what happened. - I don't understand. - It was your son, in the fight. I think you're making a mistake. Yes it's him, Mickäel Yes, it's true, it's me. Uh... I'm sorry ma'am. I'll do what needs to be done. I'll punish him. Apologize. Sorry. - It won't happen again. - It won't happen again. Okay, good, thank you. Good night Good night. What did you do, Laure? What did you do? Why did you do that? I don't know. Come here! You told everyone you were a boy? You lied? You pulled your sister into it? Why did you do that? Eh? Go to your room. You shouldn't blame your mum, you know. Don't worry about it, it will pass. It will fix itself, it's already over. I want it to go away. Please? Will it go away? I got one. A woman? No. - A man? - Yes. - Is he real? - No. - From TV? - Yes. - Is he nice? - Not really. Is he handsome? No. - Is he bald? - Yes. Is he on a show? Uh... No. - Oh, I know, he's on a commercial? - Yes. - That fat guy of the pasta commercial? - Yes. Darling. Jeanne. Wake up. You should go back to your own bed, okay? Go to your room. Laure. Common, get up, get dressed. No, you'll wear this. - I don't want to. - You don't have a choice. Put it on. Common, go. Okay, let's go. - Where to? - To the boy you hit. - No. - Yes. Stop, that's enough. - I don't want to go there. - Listen! No! I'm sick. - Let go of me. - That's enough. Jeanne, stop, let go of your sister. You're coming now. Close the door, Jeanne. Close the door. - Hello ma'am. - Hello. We came to apologize again. You didn't have to. Actually it's a bit more complicated. - We're not going home? - No. - Where are we going? - To Lisa's. No! Why? What's your problem? Were you going to be a boy for the whole year? School is soon. You have to tell them. Listen... I'm not doing this to punish you, or to give you a lesson. I have to, you understand? It don't care that you pretend to be a boy. And it doesn't hurt me. But it can't go on. If you have an idea, tell me, because I don't. You have a solution? - Hello. - Hello. Is Lisa there? She'll soon be home. Is it okay if we wait? What happened? Nothing horrible. I'll explain. Come in. - Lisa? - Yeah? Come here. This is Mickäel's mum. And you know what? Mickäel is a girl. - She came to my house in a dress. - No way. You must be joking! Hey, he's over there, look! We hear you're a girl? We'll check. Stop it! - What are you going to do? - Check it out. Let him go. You'll check. No. If he's a girl, you hugged him. That's gross. Isn't it? - Yes it is. - Then do it. You don't want to go out? Enjoy the weather? I'd rather stay here. School starts tomorrow. It's not that bad. He's waking up. It's not easy to wake up. Shh. Look. Cool. What's your name? My name is Laure. Subtitles edited by Subransu
