Our ancestors thousands of years ago were working with precious metals and gemstones. The artistry that went into these pieces tells us a lot about their culture. Are you checking Hero Watch again? Just staying vigilant, seeing if there are any heroes who need help. Okay. It's just things have been boring lately. Riri's at the science festival, Daisy and Rayshaun are busy with S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff, and every villain seems to be on vacation. We're supposed to be working on our superhero skills. We can't do that without bad guys. Give me a jaywalker, something! I don't know, I'm diggin' the downtime. I made it to level ten of "Cosmic Blaster," and I tried every flavor at the vegan doughnut shop. Skip basil rhubarb crunch, by the way. Weird. Serious? Basil rhubarb crunch is amazing. Now, if you want weird, try the honey arugula. Kamala, Dante, pay attention. There may be a quiz when we get back to school. Love hearing that enthusiasm for history. The centerpiece of the exhibit, this priceless crown, is made of solid gold with platinum inlays and 100 precious stones. - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's... fine. Huh? Whoo-hoo, finally, an emergency, one where everyone ends up okay, of course, but we save the day! Huh? Maybe we should let museum security handle it. No way. Secret Warriors coming in hot. Hmm. J... just w... workshopping it. Hold on, my arm's caught in the sleeve. Where's the bad guy? He doesn't stand a chance now that Ms. Marvel and Inferno are here. Um, hi. I think maybe I just got a little too close to the display. You sure you didn't see anyone else? Maybe a villain engaged in nefarious misdeeds? Yeah, no. I'm Zayla. I'm a part of the field trip. Sorry. Okay, then. Catch up with the class. Who exactly are you supposed to be? Hey, aren't you in my class? Uh, no, no. He's no one. He's just someone out there fighting crime. You should really pay attention to the teacher. Eyes forward, young lady. Do you think we're really having a quiz on the museum exhibit? If so, cool with me. All about the normal stuff, remember? I used to believe the hype about normal, but it is so overrated. My life now blows it out of the water. I'm pretty sure you were always above average. America, what do you think? Being normal, yes or who needs it? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening to whatever that is. Wait, what? That's the millionth text you've gotten today. What's going on? Uh, no, no more than usual. Just... you know, nothing. Yeah, seems like nothing. Ah, I'm not the only one. Ugh, just my mom. Since I joined the Secret Warriors, I keep missing family stuff. She's all over me. It's good things are slow. You can put in some family time. Ugh, and have my mom question every single one of my life choices? "Sorry, Ammi, science project." That's kind of what this is, right? "Don't worry, smiley face, smiley face." Only two? Any more than that and she'll suspect something. Hey, Gwen, Doreen. Oh, webs! Hey, guys. Great, Ammi says I have to be home for dinner tomorrow. Special family event, plus three smiley faces. Ugh, now I suspect something. Ooh, what's the family event? Anything cake-worthy? Birthday, graduation, a "Hey, I just felt like baking a cake party"? No idea. I must have forgotten something. Why is this so stressful? Wow, your life is really hard. I know, right? Mushface, what's wrong? Yeah, Lockjaw's been doing that all day. Must have caught a bummer of a cold. Symptoms include runny nose, cough, and uncontrollable teleportations. Oh, check it out, tiny stethoscope. Adorbs, right? Yeah, Doreen, that's just what I was thinking. Tippy, how about taking care of the sick puppy? Uh-uh Don't sell yourself short. You nursed me through food poisoning once. That's dedication. Okay, if you help out, you can have all the nut bars. Ugh, yeah, this seems like a good time to practice my superfast costume change. Hey, I have to run to the music store. Broke a drumstick. Might have been feeling the rhythm a little too much. Anyone else? Yeah, I'll come along. I haven't been to a music store since, like... Feels like forever. Okay, anyone else? Ew, sorry, Tips. You get the tissues. I'll grab the mop. These were always my favorite. No way. You played the drums? We should jam sometime. Friends and I back home in Illinois were, uh, gonna start a band. I haven't played since I lost my drums in the fire. But I'm... I'm cool just hanging out in the music store like a normal person. Um, since when are you not normal? I don't know, maybe since I burned down my family's house, destroyed everything they had. Oh. Yeah, you're right. You're definitely not normal. Well, you know, my dad literally hunted me across the city because he thought that Ghost Spider killed my best friend. Right. I guess it's an understatement that family stuff can be hard for people like us, huh? I'm gonna take a walk, just clear my head. You'll come play with us sometime? Yeah, sure. Huh? It's good to be me. Took you long enough. Well, I had to wait for someone to lure the guard away. Let's just get this done. Hey, Dad, Mom. We told you to wait in the car and to use our supervillain names when we're in public. Fine, Invisibilio, the Shocktress. At least if I had powers, I'd choose a better name. Do you know how hard it is to find a supervillain name that isn't already taken? Clearly she gets her attitude from you, and there's no way the lack of powers is from my side of the family. Whatever. Eh, eh, eh, there's no need for that tone, young lady. We do and do and do for you, and we get no respect. Now go on. Stay out the way. Just trying to help. I was the one who told you about this exhibit in the first place. Just step back. Ah! They must have a localized micro generator. Oh, my life is so hard! Maybe if you... Just go. Go. You know, go drink a smoothie, huh? That's something the powerless people do. You go do that. You, think of something! If the lasers aren't reading the full atomic spectrum... They are. They definitely are. What? Reinforced glass. You got a blowtorch for your last birthday. I don't suppose you remembered to bring it. Why would I think I needed a blowtorch? Just leave the crown. Also, please add hammer to my next birthday wish list. You want to see me? Okay, I'm here. But this is a bad idea. Dante. Gabriela. How did you find me? I used a private detective. I'm here to bring you home. Do Mom and Dad know? Are they okay with it? N... Not yet, but they will be. Then I won't go back. Give them time. They'll understand. But they already understand. I am dangerous. What happened before... I can't hurt them again. What about everyone here? You're not worried about them? I'm around people like me, okay? We help each other. You already have a family that loves you. Don't give up on that. Gabi, please, just go home. I'll start contacting buyers. This stuff must be worth millions. Even though we didn't get the crown because someone got in the way! I didn't stop you from getting the crown. I tried to help. But... you can't! Oh, my darling, it's all right. Your father and I wouldn't love you any more if you had powers. - Sorry, sorry. - Who am I kidding? Of course we would! Hey, Dad, check out this necklace I picked up at the museum. What? Uh, did someone say something? Huh. Did you just shock me? I... It was probably just static electricity from the carpet. Mm-mm, something's wrong. I can feel it. Oh, I can't do it! My power's gone. Mine too! I have to be able to turn invisible. It's in my name! What are we gonna do now? We can't be expected to get real jobs. What if you just try really hard? You don't think I'm trying hard? You try hard! Oh, thank goodness. Mom, Dad, look at what this necklace lets me do. Slightly traumatized here. Besides, we already know what you can't do. That all changes now. Dante. Why are you here, Gabi? I'm not going back to Illinois without you. I mean it. And I meant everything that I said last night. You admitted it, Mom and Dad aren't ready to forgive me. Give them time. Time won't fix this. You shouldn't have come here! See? Even you're scared of me. N... No, I just... This is who I am. It's not safe to be around me. Just... go. So that's what he can do. Mm, chicken soup. I'm so hungry right now. I wouldn't. I don't think that's chicken. Ew. Ah, thanks. I got a study group later, so probably not making it home for dinner. Better text Dad so he doesn't put out an APB. You gotta work on your sarcasm, chica. Almost believed you for a second. No, no, like, he will actually put out a search party to come and find me. He's, heh, been a little much lately, checking up on me all the time, always wanting to know what I'm doing. Wow, how do you even deal? Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. What? Nothing. I have to get back to work. Did you hear about the heist at the museum last night? They were probably casing the joint while we were there. I've been thinking about it all day, and I have a plan. So we go back to the scene of the crime, maybe find a guard who'll let us see security footage. Mm-hmm. Could be AIM or Hydra or something, but it's not really their style. Maybe an inside job or... Hey, you're not even listening to me. I'm sorry. Look, I can't do the hero stuff today. Okay, seriously, what's up with you lately? Nothing, I just need some time. You wouldn't hide anything big from me, right? 'Cause you can tell me. Yeah, I know. I, uh... Look, I'll see you later. Oh. Hey, Doreen, wanna solve a crime? Do I? Gabi? You've got to stop following me. Gabi! Guess having powers doesn't make you less gullible. What did you do to my sister? She's fine. Don't come any closer! Go ahead. Let's see what you got. Yeah, no limitations Annihilation... Looking for this? What? Whoa! Come on, what happened? - I can't... - You're totally right. You can't. And now thanks to you, I can. Oh, ah! You have my powers? That's not possible. And yet... It's not easy to control. I... I... It feels simple at first, and then suddenly, it's like a living thing. Aw, was it super hard for you? Thanks for the advice, but I got this. On the edge, letting loose Shake the ground with my moves Got a voice that'll make you shatter I'm a natural at being a natural disaster... Secret Warriors, I've got a situation here. Wha... What happened? This is why you shouldn't be around me. I'm not leaving you. Then you have to at least get back. Like a one-girl army Goodness gracious, I'm outrageous Storming in like I run this party Shock your heart like electric strings Wait, no, that wasn't... Whoo, hold on to your hazelnuts! Help's almost there! I don't need help. I've got everything I need. Whoa! What's going on? It was Zayla, the new girl from the museum. She took my powers somehow. She was wearing this necklace, but she got away. Keep moving, everyone! Nothing to see here, except maybe a girl who's only got seven minutes to make it home for dinner! Ugh! We're gonna need more than this. A-ha! Ha! Hey, hey, hey Looking for a lift? I don't care if it breaks or burns I take it all, no, I don't take turns These are the people you were telling me about? We're not just people! We're his team. Also, who are you? Hey, America, Ghost-Spider, let's make it rain! Hope you're thirsty. One giant drink of water on the way. Crash down on the world Drown it like a tidal wave Can we please wrap this up in, like, no minutes? Seriously, this again? I'll give you a ride home if you stop talking about dinner! Deal. Everyone stand clear if you don't want a major shower. Yeah! A natural disaster Well, the fire's out and the alley looks cleaner. So do you guys. Not saying that you, you know, needed it 'cause you were stinky or anything. You... You weren't. You didn't. I'll stop. I'll stop. But what's her name got away with Dante's powers. That was amazing. Now I know what you meant when you said your friends have your back. Everyone, this is my sister, Gabriela. She just got to town. Your sister? Your sister! Oh, that's really great! So good to meet you. Aw, come on. Let's give them some time to talk. Oh, right, sure. We really need to track down Zayla before she burns down all of Jersey. Oh, I'm on it yesterday! Ugh, I'm so grounded. Huh? See you back at HQ later, right? Mm-hmm. Thank you so much. I owe you one. Don't mention it. I mean that. Let's please not go over it again. Kamala Khan! Do you mean to tell me you... on that? I wore a helmet! And who is this? Uh, Ammi, this is my friend America Chavez. America, Ammi. Nice to meet you. Hold on. You are staying for dinner. Uh, no, I don't think I... If someone is driving my daughter around on a dangerous machine of death, I want to get to know them. There's plenty of food. Thanks, but... I really have to... No buts. Now come inside. I thought you said this is a special family celebration. It is. We're celebrating you being home for dinner. We're having chicken korma. Since you managed to get here alive, I suppose you should eat. Kamala, bring your friend inside and set the table, eh? Chicken korma does sound good... I think. It felt like such a part of me. I can't believe it's gone. Maybe now you can come home. Yeah. What will you tell your team? Without my powers, I'm not sure I'm still part of the team. I started by trying to track the gemstones and frankly, not particularly stylish necklace Zayla was wearing. That's what let her take Dante's power, right? Something that strong must have some unique properties. Yeah, but I couldn't find any information on it at all, like, none, so I switched tactics and found this, security footage from all over town. She's definitely been busy. Uh, did she burn down an ice cream cart? Who does that? She's gotten better at controlling it. Dante! Been working on your silent lurking, I see. She's more precise and looks more confident. Which is when she'll get reckless and dangerous. We'll figure this out. There has to be a way to get your powers back. Hey, where's Gabriela? Your sister should stay here if she wants. There's definitely space. Thanks, Gwen. She's at a hotel. Tell her to come over! Not gonna miss a chance to quiz her about your super awkward preteen years. We didn't even know you were in touch - with your family. - I'm not. Or... I wasn't. She tracked me down. Aw, Tips, you're a natural healer. Hey, Kamala, dinner at 7:00, right? Your mom asked me to pick up some chapati. I'll do it... Once I figure out what that is. Y... Yeah, America. See ya later. What the what was that about? When she dropped me off yesterday, Ammi invited her for dinner, and she said yes, and then Ammi invited her for dinner again tonight, and she said yes again. So she... Like, had fun? I guess. I wouldn't have expected her to, but... Well, you said your mom's a good cook, so maybe she really liked the food. Fire in a shopping center. I bet a billion Brazil nuts it's Zayla. Good thinking, Doreen. Let's go. Guess, I wouldn't be much help. You could stay here and monitor things, send us updates. We always need updates. Yes, every team has someone in a chair, feeding data and passing info to the team. You're that someone in the chair. Guy in the chair, right. It's around the back. We got her now. Let's go... Oh. Looks like a big, fat nada on the arson alert. Probably just a fry cook who let things get out of control. Happens every day. - Does it, though? - Mm-hmm. Hey, it's almost dinner time. Meet at your house? I gotta pick up that chapati bread thing. Yeah, great. When did my life get so weird? I mean, besides the stretchy thing. I'm gonna need a full dinner report with diagrams and footnotes, also some leftovers. America, thank you so much for bringing the chapati. So helpful. I got the right kind? Perfect I'll teach you how to make daal to go with it, if you want. You would? Uh, yeah, sure, great. Kamala can join us too, of course, if she can pull herself away from "The World of Crafty Craft." Ammi, I told you, it's not... Never mind. Where's Aamir? Your brother is volunteering at the soup kitchen tonight. But we're glad you're here. So you girls have not told me, how did you meet? America, are you in Kamala's school? No, actually, we're on a team... Of bowlers! Where we bowl and then get doughnuts and talk about the bowling team while we eat doughnuts, like we did that one time. Right, bowling. You, my daughter, you bowl? On this bowling team, there are boys? Uh, yeah, a couple, I guess. I don't... I don't really notice. I'm pretty sure you notice Dan... Nope, no one to notice! I'm just so focused on bowling. What? Who is this Dan? No! Uh, nobody. He's no one. I mean, he's a person but nobody I'm interested in or anything like that, at least not until after college or when I'm 30 or something. Can we not talk about this? More potatoes, please! You don't have to take the "guy in the chair" thing so literally. I'm just looking out for more attacks or fires, suspicious fires, anything. All right, let's see it. Bus fares to Illinois? Yeah, suspicious. Are you thinking of leaving? Yes. Maybe. I don't know. It feels lame to be here and not be doing more. That's not the only reason we keep you around, you know. I do need someone I can beat at video games. Without powers, I've got a chance for things to go back to normal, whatever that is. Maybe it's not even possible at this point. When your dad was hunting Ghost-Spider, how did you deal? Had to find a different way forward and accept that he doesn't understand everything. It may take a while, but they love you. You know, the fact that your sister showed up, that's huge. Ah, ah, ah... This is where my brilliant plan comes together. The armored car leaves the bank through downtown, it stops at this traffic light near the graveyard, and, bam, we hit it there! I'll turn invisible and pull out the unsuspecting driver. You shock the car's alarm system. We grab the cash. Then we are out. Could work. Or... Wait for it. We wait until it's in the tunnel. Bam! See that? There's too much traffic past the graveyard. That's because people are dying to get in there. Right? Eh? You're right. We'll do the tunnel. Mom, Dad, I have something I really want to show... Not now, sweetie. Mommy and Daddy are doing important supervillain things. This is really cool. If you just check it out and see what I can do and then maybe I can help you and... Sweetheart, I mean this in the most nurturing and maternal way, and we want you to do you, but there's nothing you can help us with... Really, nothing. We love you anyway, blah, blah, blah. You're perfect the way you are. Will you please just listen to me for once? Oh, not with that tone, young lady! Now go to your room! I tell you the one power I wish she had, huh, being seen and not heard, okay? Touché, my pet. Boom. I'll get the one thing you couldn't. Then everyone will see me and hear me loud and clear. Mm... Ooh. How about grabbing dinner when we finish? I am craving barbecue. I tweaked my facial recognition program to overlay onto social media feeds. We'll find her. Not to pat myself on the back, mostly because my arms are kind of on the short side. Aww, thanks, Tip. Mm. I'm just gonna go see what's up. Punching bag, nice. Very Captain America. I hate that I can't help when it's my powers causing the trouble. Last I checked, you're not the one blowing up ice cream carts, and you are helping as much as any of us right now. Look, you'll figure this out and get your powers back and you'll be toasting marshmallows again in no time. You're amazing. Uh, I mean, uh, you guys, all you guys. What do you mean "you"? The team is all of us, even without your... Unless you don't want them back. I definitely don't want Zayla to have them. But I... It would make things easier with your family. Well, I want to see them and I want to make things right, but I'm settling in here, and I've got school and my friends, and I don't want to leave... everyone, so, yeah. Leave? You're actually thinking about that? You promised not to keep anything big from me, remember? And this would be big. Yeah, it would be. Major update! It's still like looking for a needle in a haystack, but I've narrowed down the haystack. Sending location data. Just don't do anything rash, okay? And we are so gonna talk more later. Roaring thunder How big is our search area? Not to brag, but this program is almost as smart as I am. It'll refine the data and feed it to us in the field. As long as it doesn't develop consciousness and take over the world, we'll be good. Double M, you and America take midtown. Come on, Ghostie. That was definitely bragging. Anyway, so you know you don't have to get a cooking lesson from my mom. My parents can be so embarrassing with all the questions and the being so nosy. Right, how mortifying for you. I know, right? Ammi pries into my life and puts me on the spot. Ugh, seriously, if she could just not care so much about everything I do... You're clueless, all of you! You have everything, and you just complain about it. Gwen's whining about her dad. Dante's family is practically begging him to come home, but he's all conflicted. And you, your mom cares enough to want to know about your life. Do you have any idea what I'd do to see my moms again, to hear them ask about my life and my friends? Fresh, hot location data coming to you now. I'm... I'm sorry. I guess I didn't realize that... That you take everything you have for granted? Or that I might miss the people who love me? No, it's just... Let's just go deal with this. Don't know why my parents had to make such a big production of this. See, Dad? What'd you think of that, Mom? That's not really your look. I'm thinking more orange jumpsuit, maybe some handcuffs. So sorry you couldn't catch me last time, but coming at me again, huge mistake. Eh, you're the one who made the mistake lighting things up all over town. My genius facial recognition tracker picked up a 100% hit. Since when are squirrels tech geniuses? Uh, that's Squirrel Girl. The genius comes from the girl part. No one tell Tippy I said that. Oh, for sure. But you can tell her, I did this! Ah! Looks like I've gotten pretty good at this, huh? Ugh! You took something that's not yours. Really should have learned that lesson in preschool. - What? - Huh? Wait, I... I didn't do that. And I really didn't do that. You touched her and there was this red glowy thing that, like, flew out of you and now there's a new bead glowing red... It's so the necklace! Thought you said you were a genius. Took you long enough to figure it out. Now I've got the crown and I'm more powerful than my parents and you and everyone put together. Wow, we just met and you're already getting on my nerves. No, that's mine! Stay away from her! Don't let her touch you! Look out! She's right behind you. Your friend's fire powers were cool, but I'm thinking bigger. See what I did there, bigger? If I'm gonna be superpowered, I need a thing. Maybe funny is my thing. Or talking too much. Anyway, the point is, I don't want just some powers. I want them all! - Ah! - Ah! Wait, this is way too easy. Think I'm in the mood for a bonfire instead. We need cover. Come back here. This power is a little weird, right? Who you calling weird? Hold on, chica! My... My... My powers are gone too. Not gone, just with someone who knows how to use them. America! Now that I have all the powers, what to do with you? Imprisoning you in a web cocoon would be fun, and punching is always cool, but I'm gonna go old school. Fire's so primitive but so hot. Hmm? What is that? You came. You have no idea how many tries it took to get here, but I heard over the comm. I couldn't leave my team. "I couldn't leave my team." Grow up! No, no, no, no, no, Tippy! I can't understand you! This can't be happening. I don't know what you're saying. Oh, you've seen stuff you just can't unsee, haven't you, squirrel? I'm so sorry. She took my powers I... I don't know what to do. Well, try to unsee this! Ah, ah, ah! It is good to be me again. You got your powers back! It happened after the red bead was knocked off the necklace. So get the beads off the necklace, get our powers back. Which means getting close enough to grab them. No problem. 'Cause heroes shine in different ways Ugh! Get off me! Don't talk to Tippy like that! Don't need to fit into the crowd To be a force of nature Ah! Whoo-hoo, fake out! Oh! We were born for this Oh, yeah! Hey, SG, maybe you can't touch her, but I can think of a bunch of someones who can. Best idea ever! And if your heart surrenders All right, troops, get the beads off that necklace. The world ain't ready for me Another one down, ugh! The numbers are not looking good for you. Don't care if the world ain't ready for me Look, I know you're not all-in on this power thing. I overheard you and your sister, so just walk away and we're cool. Not a chance! Powers like these should only go to someone who really wants them. I don't just want powers to want them. They're part of me. Another part of me is someone who helps his friends, no matter what. Swords against a superpower? That's cute, but I'm not playing around! I'm more powerful than you can ever be, anyone can ever be! You're not powerful just because you can make fire or have super strength. It's how you use it. How about like this? No, no, no. When you feel like the world doesn't know you You think you got what you wanted? You don't even know what you want. I do now. And you know it can't stay out for very long I want to be myself, all of myself, even the parts that I don't always like, and that's the difference between you and me. Roaring thunder And I feel sorry for you. Stronger than roaring thunder Not sure it should go back on display. That's asking for trouble. Yeah, we'll toss it over to S.H.I.E.L.D. It's more their thing. Hold up. No one move. Where is the crown? It looks so good on you, mushface. And you are royalty. But I think it's gotta go back. Must feel good to have your powers back, if that's what you want. I used to hate what my powers turned me into, but after I lost them, I didn't feel like myself. The powers changed who I am, but what they really did is make me me. You were wearing your Inferno costume under your clothes the whole time? I just really couldn't leave my team. What about your family? I'll just have to be patient while they get used to it. Maybe we can find a new way forward. Even without powers, we seriously pulled together like family today. America, you were right. I know Ammi is on me all the time because she wants the best for me, so, yeah, I could probably complain a little less and appreciate her a little more... or, like, a lot more. But maybe you could try not to push people away so much too? Huh! I'm so sorry your family's not here. You can hang with mine whenever you want, but, you know, we're kind of all your family too. Yeah, and just like family, we're gonna be all up in your business and nag you and also always, always be there for you if you let us. When something good happened to someone in my family, we'd go for tacos, maybe if this is sort of like a family. What do you think, mushface, carne asada? Seems like he's doing better. Uh, Tippy, how you feeling? Oh! I didn't expect you. I thought you would be busy with your team of bowling. I felt like being here. I made lamb biryani, your favorite. I know my daughter has her own busy life, school, friends, activities, even if she doesn't always tell me about them. - Ammi, I... - Soon she'll be grown and won't be home, but for now, I like getting to know the young lady she is becoming and meeting her friends, all of her friends, whenever she would like to introduce them to us. I promise I'll be home for dinner more often, and wherever my Abu and Ammi are will always be my home. And Aamir? Yeah, sure, him too. Sweetie, we have never been more proud of you than we are in this moment! And that shade of orange looks divine on you. Not everybody can pull that off. And when you get out of here, we have big plans, huge. Think Europe's greatest hits, the British Museum, the Louvre! The Parthenon? They've got stuff worth millions. Ah, that's our girl! Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad. I'm really glad you decided to come home, even if it's just for a visit. You really think Mom and Dad will forgive me after what I did? They love you. That's the best place to start. Watch me rise
