THIS IS A STORY ABOUT SUICIDE AND AS SUCH, IT SHOULD BE APPROACHED CAREFULLY. - Your change and thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse me! - Coming, sir. What can I get you? It's November 16th, and this is the noon news. Earlier today, a 26-year-old woman living in Nakanoku Ward was found dead after falling from the 5th floor balcony of her apartment building. Mariko Ikagawa, aged 26, who lived in this apartment building, died at around 4:30 a.m. on the 16th. A neighbor found her lying on the apartment building grounds and called the fire department… She died too soon. Young people these days. She probably got flamed on social media. But I wouldn't like it if someone jumped off the roof at our apartment. Yeah, that would be awful! [ Mariko, please call me ] [ Mariko ] [ Whiny Boss ] A woman named Mariko Ikagawa died that day. She was my friend. 47,000 yen… 38,000 yen… Built 57 years ago… If you sneeze, the floor might come loose. Wow, look at this! It says 26,000 yen. You can live on your part-time, right? If you don't splurge on luxuries… You can do it right now. That's nice. I wanna move out of my house. I wanna live with you, Shiino. Huh? I don't care if this place is 50 or 60 years old, I want to move here right now. Now would be good. I wanna live happily with you. I wanna have a cat, too. I can't cook. Is that okay? What? I know. - During the cooking class… - No. Mariko, that was… I told you I had no choice. - What? That was you. - Even you, Mariko. It's okay. I'll do the cooking. You in? Even if we become grannies, you and I will always be together. [ My Broken Mariko ] [English subtitles brought to you by ECOTV] [ Mariko, please call me ] Hey Mariko, wanna do fireworks today? I won it as a prize. It's lonely to do it alone. Yay! I wanna do it, I wanna do it! Shiino, you won the fireworks? The one at the shopping district? Yeah, 1st prize was a trip to Hawaii, and 2nd prize was a travel voucher, so I figured maybe fireworks, how cheap… - That's great, fireworks. I've only ever won 6th in the lottery. What's the 6th prize? - A tissue. - That's the consolation. Yeah. But even if I won the trip, I still wouldn't be able to go. Right. So I'd rather have fireworks. I'm excited! Then we'll meet at the Choo Choo Train Park at around 6:30. Yeah! Okay. What? What? Get away. Get away. - No, no, no. - It's hot! What do you mean it was zero yesterday? Good morning, I'm heading out. Hey, Shiino! What were you doing yesterday? You ignoring me?! You son of a bitch! She totally heard me, right? Excuse me. I… was a friend of hers. Can I… take a look inside… There's nothing more here. Her parents took all her belongings away. Oh… Is that so? Yeah. H-Hey, Is the deceased… at her parents' house? Don't know. Ah, no… I heard it was a direct burial. Direct burial? Yeah. In her hometown? No, she wasn't delivered home. She gets cremated after death. Yeah, well, they can't cremate her until 24 hours have passed. By now, it's… just bones, probably. What the heck? If she had friends, they usually should have done one. A funeral. Well, if they have that dough, they should be paying us. No, jumping off made this a stigmatized property. Well, good thing she didn't do it inside. Hey. - Oh. - Don't "Oh" me. You blew off a sale yesterday. And won't answer your phone. What's with that attitude this morning? Where have you been, huh? It's bad. Do you know what you did? I'm talking about the company's trust. - First, let me say that you're the worst… - I'm sorry. My friend died, so I couldn't work. You know, Ms. Shiino. That's no excuse to skip work. I'm sorry, I need your help with something… Don't ask me for everything! I'm sorry. I'll work on it myself. No, don't give up just because someone says so. Shut up, you piece of shit. It's as fast as the chat room. I'm always left on read. [ Mariko, please call me ] Hey, Mariko, is there anything I can do for you right now? Anything… whatever it is, anything… This time I will save you. Wait for me, Mariko. Where the hell are you going, huh?! Hey! You're going out to play without making dinner? Hey! That's not right, huh? Hey. Hey! Say you're sorry now! Hey! You idiot. Idiot! Hey! Say you're sorry! - I'm sor… - Apologize! Apologize! Mariko! Mariko! Hey, open the door! Open it! I'm gonna call the cops! Open the door! I'm calling 110! You hear me, you idiot? Hey, open the door! Hey! Get out here! Hey! Mariko! Open the door! Mariko! Shiino… I'm so… I'm sorry… I can't… go today… Back then, every minute and every second of every day, Mariko tried her best to be a good girl. Yes? I'm sorry to bother you on your day off. My name is Shiino of Hatomune Corporation. You see, we are currently going door to door to see if there are any problems in this area. "Problem…" This place is full of problems. Oh, I see! Huh? Are you… I believe this woman is his second wife, Kyouko Tamura. …asking for this and that. Based on our professional knowledge of what is needed to solve the problem, we will introduce you to all kinds of products and let you try them out for yourself. That kind of thing… Please! If you could at least listen to me… If you don't, I'm gonna get fired by my evil asshole boss. Oh no. Seeing a young girl like you reminds me of what I went through when I first moved to Tokyo. Why don't you come in and rest for a bit? Thank you! Thank you. Okay. Come on in. - Sorry for intruding! - Yeah. This place is a mess, right? No, no! It looks better than it did back in middle school. I'll make you some tea. You can sit if you like. - Thank you. - Yeah. If only this person had remarried Mariko's father earlier, then she would still be… Huh? No, I'm sorry for the bother. Listen, Shiino. You know, my mom. She left me again. She said I was bad. She said it was my fault. Because… Because I seduced him. That my dad put his hands on me. Shiino, what should I do… My mom… might not ever come home anymore… What? The hell are you doing?! My daughter's altar, you bitch! What are you doing?! Hey… stop it! - Wait! Hey! - Stop it! I said don't! Who the fuck are you?! Careful! - Who the hell are you?! - Stop! When she was in high school, you raped your own daughter! When she was in junior high, you treated your own daughter like a slave! And in elementary school, you stole her mother from her! You sick bastard! You mourning for her makes me so fucking sick! Mariko… I am Tomoyo Shiino, Mariko's childhood friend! If I have to stab you… I'll take Mariko's remains with me. What are you talking about? Give that back! - Stop! - Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Ow! Mrs. Kyouko? Mariko! Mariko! Mariko! The whole thing is your fault! Because you did all those disgusting things to your own child! You're the one who messed everything up! It's you! Settle down, for fuck sake! How did it come to this… huh?! Because of you… Oh, shit, that hurts… Damn that old man. You used to love sending me letters. I wonder if they're calling the cops on me right now. In fact, the company has already been notified and this address may have been given out, right? Hello! I'm so happy I'm in the same class as you, Shiino. You're always smoking, but you smell nice. Why is that…? Because I carried around toilet deodorant spray so the teachers wouldn't recognize the smell. Shiino, are you going somewhere for summer break? Every year we would go to my grandma's house. My parents got divorced so we probably won't go this year. I see. What are you writing? A letter to you. I'm right beside you, so why write a letter to me? There are things you can't say face-to-face. Like what? Like, "Last night you appeared in my dream," or "Santoku's fried side dish tastes different now." It's not something to write about in a letter. Listen, Mariko. Let's go to the beach, just the two of us. I'd love to go to the beach… But I can't. My dad's gonna be mad. It's fine. He won't get mad at you anymore. So let's go, Mariko. To the beach. Just the two of us. This… And… Bankbook and, uh, Yomei… I guess I don't need it. I got no shoes! No choice then… I guess I'll take that one out. Bought this with my first part-time salary and wore them out. Dr. Martens! Shit! It stinks! Ugh… it stinks. Fuck… it smells moldy. Let's go, Mariko. Dear Shiino, Hello! Listen… Yesterday, in the middle of the night, my father woke me up and said, "We're out of booze, you idiot!" So he sent me out to buy one… But I used to be afraid to walk on the road at night, but you said you often go for walks at night, so I thought maybe I could meet you. And yesterday, I wasn't scared at all. From Mari. I wanna raise a cat. Shiino, have you ever been to the beach? I heard there is one, but I was too little to remember it. I wanna go to the beach with you someday. From Mariko. I wouldn't call it a beach. As for me, yeah… maybe I'd go to Hawaii. Just kidding. Even though I sent it. [ Mariko, which beach do you wanna go to? ] I don't know if it would reach you. To be honest, you were all I had. Hey, Mariko. Did you really die without leaving me a single letter? Where… am I supposed to go? With your bones nestled within my arms, I cannot go to Hawaii. I just recited a haiku. Hey, hey, Shiino. Shiino, look! It says Marigaoka. I'd love to go there. Cape… Marigaoka. Cape Marigaoka. You said that, didn't you? Marigaoka… Cape Marigaoka. Thank you very much for waiting. We are now departing. For your safety, please fasten your seatbelts. Dear Shiino, Last night I had a dream about you. We walked together on the road in the dark. I dreamed that I was on your way to your grandma's house. Lights will go out shortly. Shiino, since your grandma is in Hawaii, you have to get on a plane somewhere. That's what you said. But I knew that you were lying, and I was happy that we could go on walking the streets at night together. Thank you very much… [ Whiny Boss ] No way I'm answering that. I'm on vacation. You stupid fuck. If you get a boyfriend, I'm just gonna die. Huh? I'm just gonna die. I am. No… I have no intention of getting one. What's wrong? Did something happen? Not a day goes by that something doesn't happen. No. Don't remind me of that now… There's so much more. Such as… Such as… We'll be arriving at Maritsuki Station shortly. - Who is it? - Well, I guess Ren. Ren. Look. But Ren is so cool. He's hot, right? - He's got practice game tomorrow. - Bring your camera, okay? Mariko, what do you wanna do today? Wanna go to McDonald's first, then the movies? Or want me to treat you? Too expensive to buy at the theater. Shiino, I'm sorry! Takuya's got a day off today. So he asked me out. Huh? I'm really sorry. We'll go to the movies next time. He'll get mad at me if I'm late. See you around. What? Mariko… Why would you go alone? I said I'd go with you. No… because you're always busy with your dates. The movie is over. I wanted to watch it with you. ♪ Beach? That sound is the beach! Huh? Sn… Purse snatcher! …tcher! S… tcher! S… tcher! Squirrel? Oh, it's purse snatcher. Fucking purse snatcher! Are you okay? Do I look okay to you? You look… okay to me. How can I be okay, huh?! They took my wallet, phone, and Yomei, everything. Yomei… No… That guy… I gotta go after that guy. The letters… Mariko's letters! That fucking bastard! Mariko… Did you find your bag? No… Right. Hey… By any chance, did you wait here all this time for this? It's not something you can just leave alone. That stuff… By the way, you got any money? Ah… N-N-No! My wallet is also in the bag. Stolen, so I don't have a single yen… What? Huh… I think that should be enough to get you through today. Thank you so much. I'll pay you back. Would you mind giving me your name and contact info? No. I'm not the type who gives out names. Well, I'll leave you to it. [ Narita store Makio ] Sorry for the wait. Come on… You'll never find a boyfriend if you keep acting like that. But that guy earlier was so nice. If I were to get married, I'd want someone like that. But you know, if he likes me, no matter who he is, I'll put up with it. But you fucking had me! That scared the shit out of me… What's the matter, sweetie? Where are you from? Why are you all alone? Right? Girls shouldn't drink alone. They shouldn't. And you're out of booze. Let us buy you a drink. Come and join us. I wanna make out with a young girl! No matter how old a man gets! In any case, you shouldn't be drinking alone. There's bunch of perverts out there. I heard there was a snatcher tod… Shut the fuck up! I've already been robbed! I don't have time to be talking to you motherfuckers! While I'm talking to you, her memory is slowly fading away. I can only remember her pretty side. I told her over and over that she was a pain in the ass… Even I thought of her as a pain in the ass… Don't do something so stupid. If you get a person you love, and that person becomes more precious to you than me, abandon me, and go off somewhere. If you leave me alone, then all my life, I will never forgive you. If you come to hate me, I'm gonna die! I'll kill myself! You don't have to scare me like that. You're the most precious person in the world to me. You sure are tough. Drunkenly passed out in a place you don't know, sleeping outside no less. What a wild life you lead. Did you get what you came here to do? If you need help, I'll lend you a hand. Sorry about the money. I'll think of something before I leave this town. I gave that to you. I gave it to you because I wanted to. Did you brush your teeth? Well… Oh… I'm sorry. - I stink, don't I? - No, it's not that. I love brushing my teeth. I thought maybe you are too. No… I never thought about it. - Oh, I see. - But I'll take it. Whatever it is that brought you here, don't give up on it. If you don't take a bath, get a good night's sleep, and eat properly, you won't be able to think straight. Maybe you got something there. You should hold yourself precious, please. I remember saying the same thing to her. But… that didn't do anything. No matter how much I sincerely worried about her, she was in a place where that kind of worry wouldn't help her, you know. I better get going. Mariko, open up or I'll call my friends too. Shut the fuck up! I already called the cops! Don't ever show your fucking face to Mariko again! Ah! Hello, is this the police? A guy's causing havoc in front of our place right now! And we're hurt, too! Open up! There were times that I just didn't know what to do. Open up, Mariko. The more I realized that I don't understand you. Hey, you hear me, Mariko?! I said open up! Shiino! Over here. I read that this place has great pancakes, so I ordered some for you. You… Oh… This? The other day he said he wanted to see me, so I went, and got pulled a bit, and it broke. He took my purse, too. I only had 130 yen at the time. I figured, "Oh well…" Strange, huh? You know, life is really… strange. Thanks for waiting. Here are your original pancakes. Wow, looks delicious! Why the hell did you go see him?! You just had to think about it, right? You know what would happen to you. This time he… he could have killed you! You think I swung the frying pan around for nothing! I can't believe you… I seriously can't believe you! Are you fucked up in the head or something?! You're right. I'm fucked up in the head. They told me over and over that it's my fucked up self's fault. "I beat you up because you were being irritating." "I beat you up because you wouldn't listen." "I assaulted you because you seduced me." "I left you because you were a bother and clingy." I… just don't know where I should start to fix it. You know, all I… really know is that I'm glad that you're worried about me, and mad at me. That's all. Sorry. Are you mad? Shiino… This is Cape Marigaoka. Mariko. Please, Shiino. Tell me, "It's all your fault." Please. It's strange if you don't, you know? It doesn't make sense, you know? No, Mariko. You did nothing wrong. All those people around you, they all put their own weaknesses on you. It's fine. I don't deserve happiness. It's easier to think that way. You're wrong, Mariko. I can't find it. I don't see it. I don't understand it. What? You're all I have… And is the only thing that I can truly appreciate. If that's true… If that was true…! Why did you leave me? At least we could have died together… Why didn't you tell me… I wasn't even beside you when you died… I found myself with your bones… and I'm still here! There's so much… I want to say to you… Even though I'm still here! Do you… feel nothing leaving me here like this? Hey! You can't know if you're dead! Ah! I'm so fucking pissed off! I'm not gonna spread your ashes! Watch me jump off from here with your finger up your ass! So you know how it feels to not be able to stop your friend from killing herself! I hope you realize that! Just… calm down, please. - Ah! What the fuck! - Ow, ow… - You want some of this, huh?! - Calm down! - Ah! Let go of me! - Stop fighting, I know it hurts! - So you're the pervert? Hey! - That's ridiculous! Let go of me! Help me! Help me! Please help me! Shiino. Shiino. Help me! Shiino! Please help me! Shiino! Mariko! Mariko. Even as ashes, you never change. Sparkling, impossible to hold, and swept away by the wind. And then… unable to defy gravity. Even my mom said having me was a mistake. Wish that's true. I… wanted to be born to you. I wanted to be your baby. It's pretty hard to die here. I… jumped here too six months ago. Are you okay? Do I… look okay… to you? You look… okay to me. Thank you for your cooperation. Take care. Ms. Shiino, here. It's a letter from the girl you saved yesterday. She said she wanted to thank you in person, but you were at the hospital yesterday. If you'll excuse me. Dear Kind Lady, Thank you very very much. I'm sorry I couldn't thank you in person. I will never forget this kindness. Neat handwriting. Here. Ah… No. You've done so much for me, and now this… This is surprisingly delicious. You must be hungry, right? Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything… You can eat this slowly on the train. Thank you. I will never forget this kindness. I've been thinking. The only way to see someone no longer with us is to keep on living. Please cherish your memories of those precious to you and yourself. That was fast… It's good. Shiino Tomoyo. Has returned home in shame. Shiino, are you alive? I'm alive. What's up? Shiino, are you free today? Wanna have tea? Sure. What is it? You broke up with boyfriend? How do you know? You never call me when you are with your boyfriend. What? Was that so? Just get it already, will you? Oh, I'm gonna get all of it from you. There it is. Your boyfriend, he didn't hit you, right? Yeah. He's a really nice guy. Then why did you broke up with him? Because… I can't talk to you when I want to talk to you. He was a nice guy. I got nervous. When we parted, he called me a ground beetle He was a nice guy, though. Nice guys don't call someone a "ground beetle" when they part. Really? Like when I'm with you, I wish I didn't have to worry about anything. What? Nothing to worry about? Huh? Because you're not going away. Hey, I wonder what we'll do when we become grannies. Don't know. I shudder to think that I'm all wrinkled and frail. Even if I become a granny, I want to be with you. So, let's get a cat and live together. Sure. Let's get one from a cat shelter. Yeah. An ugly one that's left behind because nobody would adopt it Nice idea. Then let's think of a name. Busumi? What? Well, it's ugly and beautiful. What? That's a bit… - Then Busuyo. - It's ugly all over. - Tell me your ideas, then. - Let's see. [ Resignation letter ] I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. Huh? No, like I said, I'm sorry for the trouble. You think we can afford to lose people now? Well, sort of. Not sort of. If you really think you've troubled us, go to work, like a horse-drawn cart. If you're asking me if I really thought I caused trouble, I'm not so sure I did. Are you making fun of me? I won't let you quit! We're a very, very exploitative company, Ah, you finally said it. Ah... Not "Ah..." Go get at least two today. Are you okay? Be careful. Thank you. - I've got this, too, if you want. - Okay. I'll be back next week. - Yes, I look forward to it. - Yes. Tell me. So, what don't you get? What don't you get? So this is how I return to normalcy. For everyone other than me, your death doesn't really matter. [ Labor Standards, where to go ] Maybe I should sue… ...the man was rushed to the hospital suffering from a cardiopulmonary arrest and later died. Police arrested the 83-year-old Kaburaki Kunishi, a resident of Nakanoku Ward, who was driving a passenger car, on suspicion of negligent driving... Kyouko Tamura… How nice of her... How did she know where I live? I'm home.
