[Indistinct radio chatter] [Siren wailing] Woman: 9-1-1 emergency. Man: Yeah, man. Two guys just took off in my car. They stole it. Woman: Um, please call the local station... Man: I'm calling! What do you think this is? I'm dialing. [Glass breaking] Listen, lieutenant. How many times do you want me to tell you? Six, seven, a dozen... It's not going to change anything. Man 1: Close the door!Man 2: All right. Man 1: Let's get this damn thing out of here, now! [Engine spluttering] Officer: This is the police! Come out with your hands up and empty. Now! Man 2: Shit. Man: Get the hell out of here! Come on. Move, move, move! I told you, I was fired upon. I returned fire. I hit one of the suspects. Two others fled the Van. There's not much to see in that 459 ringer. One suspect down, in close pursuit of two others. Both armed, code 20. Over. Excuse me, detective Amy. [Sirens wailing] Man: Split up! [Sirens wailing] In the parking lot I apprehended one of the suspects. I cuffed him to the fence. [Grunts] Interlock them. Ow, man! Hang around, ese. I then proceeded to join the other officers who are now arriving at the scene in the other end of the alley. [Helicopter hovering] Officer: Stay down.[Man grunting] Officer: Stay down!Man: Come on, man. All right. Which brings us to the final suspect... As you know, we've taken statements from the other officers at the scene. What did you see? What did you hear? I'd like to hear your side of it. When I arrived on the scene, I was approached by officer hall who told me they had the situation under control. Lieutenant: What did he mean by that? Egan: When I arrived at the scene, officer hall told me that they had the situation under control. Now, to me, that means that they had the suspect in custody. Hey, egan. Hey, we got your call, man. Did you get the other perp? Yeah.all right. Good. [Shouting indistinctly] What's going on here? Oh, we're just... Reading the suspect his rights. You want a shot? Lieutenant: Was there a struggle going on? You know, I saw a lot of things lieutenant. There was a lot of bodies. There was a lot of movement. And there was a lot going on. Did the suspect put up a struggle? [Man grunting] Hey! Hey, hey, hey, that's enough. Hey, that's enough! Hey, what's your problem, man? Take a break, kazinski. [Helicopter hovering] He's dead. [Indistinct radio chatter] Did you see a weapon? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's no problemo. Right, bro? A little present from the midwatch, homie. Lieutenant: Excuse me, detective egan. What did you say? Yes. I saw a weapon. The man was armed. [Glasses clattering] [Sighs] What's the matter, honey? Cops. [Sighs] [Indistinct shouting in distance] [Shouting indistinctly] [Shouting continues] All right, here we go. We've got two rabbits coming right up the street, captain. Trolls with bags, waiting for approaching vehicle. Copy. Handsome pair, aren't they? Stay alert. Station wagon. License two, Kelly, Olivia, Jones, seven, seven, nine. That's a copy. Now?hit it. [Tires screeching] Man: Let's go. Go, go, go! [Sirens wailing] [Indistinct shouting] Man: Don't move! [Struggles]Freeze. Hurry. You, come here. Get down.[Grunts] Get down. Man: Watch him, watch him!Cover for me. Man: Get him! [Woman shouting indistinctly] Move! Woman: The Bible tells me so... [Grunts] You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney, and to have the attorney... Man: What have you got there? [Indistinct police radio chatter] [Radio chatter continues] I mean, I can understand, right? I mean, a customer comes to you with a craving. Ain't that right, Teddy? So? What's that supposed to mean? You know, times are tough... Little old ladies to mug must be in short supply 'cause of the recession or something. I mean, you must be like Santa claus. Hey, look. You guys got no complains with me. I always come up with the snaps. Always. Who do you think you're talking to here, okay? Now, look. You're coming up short, homie. Hey, I'm only a player. That's all. You guys gotta get it from them high-rollers. I do what I can to make my bank. Now this says officer Stewart, you understand that? Man: [On radio] 43, come in. Now, if you're coming up short, maybe you should get a job moonlighting at McDonald's or something. [Grunting] You read me? Huh? Like a fairy tale. [Indistinct radio chatter] [Chuckles softly] Get outta here. Let's go. This is going to tell me why I spent the last 30 minutes getting my butt chewed out by the chief?Captain, I was... I don't want to hear about it. We talked about this. We had a deal. You're supposed to work by the sop's. My standard operating procedure is to have backup, that's exactly what I did.Your job is homicide. You let the uniforms take care of the b and e's. This is not a movie, egan, and you're not robocop. You got that? Do you want a coffee?No. You know, I'm getting a little tired of getting my standard operating procedures shit on around here. Are you going to institute a command discipline?No, but you've got more stuff flying around in those files than anybody in the history of this department. And all that in the last six months. Your last discipline is just about cleared off your sheet. I'm gonna give you a second chance. I'm giving you a partner, someone to keep you under control.What? Yeah, you're gonna be amazed how easy this transition's gonna be. [Telephone ringing] Hello, Harriet.Hello, Phillip. You look great. This is a good one, ed. Oh, come on, Phil. She's just what you need. A little discipline. Let me tell you something. This is just what I don't need. She's exactly the reason I left the southwest division, okay? She's a great cop. You're a good cop, but you're a loose Cannon. Pull it together. Show some respect. Otherwise, you're going to end up in palookaville writing parking tickets, I promise you. Now, please, please, go back to work. You're liking this, aren't you?[Chuckles] [Indistinct chattering] Charming, isn't he? Oh, he'll be okay. I'll tell you this, McAllister. Keep a short leash on him. He bites anybody, it's your butt. Oh... that was some basket catch last night. Me and Willie mays. Egan: All right, it looks like we're going to be together for a little while. Or at least until I figure something out. Harriet: Why don't you apply for another transfer? You're really good at running away. I don't like this.You don't like this? Let me tell you something, I don't like partners, and I'm not sure how I feel about you I think you don't like the competition. You're afraid I'm gonna set the standards too high for you. Egan: Give me a break.Give you a break, huh? Hey, listen, I'm not going to feel bad about something that went down like 80 years ago either, all right? Oh, what, you're not over that yet?What does that mean? It means it's history. Wait a minute... What does that mean? It's over with. So what, you got a boyfriend? [Engine starts] [Indistinct police radio chatter] [Radio chatter continues] Man: Did you see anybody leave the house? Phil.hey, George. Who's the lady? That's no lady. That's my partner. I'm sorry to hear that.That makes three of us. What's the address here? [Sighing] What do you got here? That's Stewart in there, man. Somebody walked in and dropped Charlie Stewart over his breakfast. [Inaudible conversation] So this is what I've got to look forward to? I dunno if it'll be that good, egan. Anybody check the vitals? What vitals? Three gunshot wounds to the chest, that's as dead as it gets. He gets up without any help and you'd be the last one out of the room, Phil, believe me. Don't leak the evidence. Yeah, he's been dead for less than two hours, probably. What do you got?Tigers lost. [Laughing] Tigers lost. That's a good one, egan. You through feeling up the place, egan? What are you doing here, Bobby, I thought you'd be down at the morgue, sniffing. Jealousy will get you nowhere. It's all yours. As soon as Bobby and his boys get finished, seal the place up, all right?Gotcha. Let's go, McAllister. Should I call a taxi for myself? Charles beacon Stewart, born Ohio, 1946. Joined the force in 1966. Did a couple of job acquittals for on-the-job shootings, did some suspension time for excessive force charge last year. Oh, yeah, I've got that right here. What have we got? Take a look at that. Okay, where's my... [Helicopter hovering] Did you hear what I was telling you? Well hurry back, I don't want to be here till midnight! Man: Hit the half, hit the half, hit the half! [Men laughing] Hey, egan. Did you hear the department? They don't want us to book greasers anymore. We're just supposed to run them over. That way we can save on ammo and lube the car at the same time! Right? Hey. I hear you got the Stewart case. You make anything yet? Nah.too bad. It's making people nervous around here. All right. New invention. [Imitates chainsaw] [Imitates chainsaw] [All laughing] [Engine starts] [Sighs] The door was open. [Harriet sighs] Come on in. I've been sitting at my desk, what... About, uh... Three and a half hours now? Thinking to myself, "either this guy is taking the longest piss in history, "or something with some paperwork."[Egan laughs] Hey, you gonna have a drink? When are you going to start taking responsibility for yourself? You're not going to lay the responsibility lecture on me tonight, are you? No, I'm not going to be following you around, blowing your nose for you, egan. That'll be a first, won't it? [Scoffs] What does that mean, huh? I'll tell you exactly what that means. That means that for three years, that's all you did, was make sure that I was a good little cop. That I went to all the right places and said the right things with the right people, and all that. Did you stop to think for a second that maybe, maybe I was just happy being on the street, being a regular cop, doing my thing? That maybe I wasn't the guy to go around fulfilling your ambitions? My ambitions? You self-centered, egotistical bastard. All I did was care about you.Oh, come on. No, I thought we had a commitment. Listen, we did have a commitment. Is it my fault you can't tell me when something's bothering you? I mean, it's not my fault you can't express yourself. [Meows] [Pop music playing][Woman laughing] [Distant moaning] [Panting] Man: Beverly! Beverly: They're towing my car! Man: What's the matter? Hey! Wait a minute!Beverly: Don't go anywhere! Hey, wait a minute! Stay right there. I don't believe this. [Grunting] Beverly! Come on, it's not funny! Beverly! Beverly, come on! [Man grunting][Thumping] [Man groaning] Hey! What kind of a weird neighborhood is this? You're... [Screams] [Exclaiming] Baby... Hey, you guys remember when garver told a model he thought he had crabs... [Indistinct chattering]Officer: $1.69 a bottle. [Woman speaking over police radio] Phil, baby, how you be? How you doing? I'm 108 hours without a drink. Hey, look who's here, man. If we make a living being cops, we've gotta steal it to make it work. We do.Yes we do, man. [Laughs] It's going good, baby. Hey, damato, don't spend it all in one place. Thought you guys might like to know your buddy Franklin's dead. What?i just heard it on the radio. Hey, what's going on here? I mean, first Stewart and now Franklin? You don't kill cops 'cause you don't like the price of doing business. Did you learn that in the academy? Take a quaalude or something, will you? I gotta get back on patrol. We're losing money here. You can't go anywhere.What? We've got business to talk about.What business? Teddy b. He's on the street telling everybody he's got cops in his pocket, that he can buy anything he wants. Somebody's gotta talk to him.What good is that gonna do? Somebody needs to thump that junkie. You know what kind of heat that's gonna bring down? You got a problem with that, man? Hey, hey, hey!Come on! Come on! Come on! You want a piece of me? Come on! Come on! You want a piece of me? Come on.Hey. Come on, you... We're supposed to be family here. All right, man. All right. All I'm saying... All I'm saying is that Teddy b. Has killed my livelihood. Now somebody's got to do Teddy b. That's all I'm saying. And I'm saying it's you. [Indistinct radio chatter] Is that what you want? Is that what you want, hall? You want me to take care of him? Works for me. You want me to take care of Teddy b.? Yeah, that's what I want. [Indistinct radio chatter] Then it's a done deal. [Grunting] You got a big mouth and a lot of people don't like you. I didn't... I want you to find a place to hide and don't you come out till I come and get you. You got that? I can't do that. I got business to take care of. If you don't, you're a dead man. 'Cause I'll kill you myself. You got it?Yeah. What?i said, yeah, I got it. [Gun clicks] [Alarm ringing] [Exhales] [Grunts] [Indistinct chatter] Hey, egan! Egan! Franklin's got about 10 grand worth of designer suits hanging in his closet. Great. They can Bury him in one. Why don't you go outside and canvas the rest of the building, okay? I'll wrap it up in here and meet you back at the car. Yeah, go on. Female dispatcher: The owner of the red corvette, blond, Beverly Benson. Possible booking for solicitation. We have an address over on Hollywood. 1629 farm. Harriet: Thanks. Over. What have you got? Well, I talked to the landlady, and she said that there was a red corvette blocking a tenant's space right. So when the tow truck got here, the owner of the corvette came out and moved it, then went back up into those apartments. She thinks it was Franklin's. You follow? That would explain this. Ooh, these are nice. [Chuckles] Wait a second here. I gotta ask you a question. Are we cross-dressing these days, Phil? Are you kidding me? You ever seen me in a tube top? It's good stuff. I bet. Mmm. Is this it here? 316? Yeah. [Knocks] Police department. Open up. [Gun cocking][Gunshot] I'll call for backup. Go around back.Okay. [Door crashing] [Gunshot][Vase shatters] [Grunts] Drop it! I said drop the gun.[Cocks gun] [Egan grunts][Gunshot] [Both grunting] Put your hands on your head. My procedure was fine. You wanna go by procedure, fine, but you don't do it around me. Let's go. You know, I can't afford to be afraid that something might happen. [Chuckles] I didn't know you cared. Hey, this is bull-- [Grunts] Teddy b.: Ah! [Groans] All right, damn, man. I'll tell you whatever you want to know. Come one, man. Give me a break. Come on, man. [Grunts] [Screams] You know what a shooting gallery is, don't you, Teddy? Yes, home sweet home. Listen... listen, man. Listen. Look, I got some heavy--shut up! Look, I mean it, man. I could get you all the money you need, man. Just give me a chance to talk to my girls, man. They be comin' up short! Look, I mean it. I mean it. Come on, man. [Stammering] You can understand. Look, I always come up with the bank. You know that, hall. Come on, give me a break, man.Hey, Teddy, b. Lookee here. You know what that is, Teddy b.? You... you crazy. 'Cause that ain't mine, man. Tell him it don't belong to me, man. Tell him it don't belong to me. Come on, hall.You know what that is, don't you? I'm filing charges of police brutality. I got your p.O. On the way down here, Terrance. Looks like you owe a dime in Nevada. I mean, you're gonna be about 36 when you get out. Now, if you help me out, I might be able to help you out. You ain't gonna be able to help. You don't know nothing, do you, pal? We make interstate fugitive deals all the time. All you gotta do is tell us where Beverly is. We'll make sure your p.O. Knows you cooperated with us. [Door opens] You killed officer Franklin, scumbag? Are you guys whacked? I didn't kill any cop. You use this on police officers? Well, what's this?I am not a cop killer! Aguilar: What is this, huh? I tried to help you out, Terrance. You shot these officers with this? No. No.Huh? You didn't shoot these officers? Who shot at them? Santa claus? We don't have to worry about Teddy scumbag no more. Hey, would you relax, man? Now they couldn't wait for you because they like it too much. Egan. What do you got? Some punk parole violator. What's the matter with him?I don't know. Parole violator?Yeah. Ex-boyfriend. Thought we were coming after him. What about the girl? Ah, that scumbag wouldn've give her up in a second. I don't think he's seen her for at least 24 hours. So why is she hiding?Maybe she swings a mean bat. Thank you.Or she saw who did. Could be.[Elevator dings] [Machinery whirring] Kazinski: [Over recording] Somebody's got to do it. And I'm saying it's you, egan. Not good enough. I want you to pull him off the street. And what do we get? A couple of two-bit lowlifes. No. I wanna go higher than that. Listen, if you wanna go higher than that, then go higher than that. My elevator stops here. Come on, for Christ's sake! If we don't get to the root of the corruption, we've wasted our time. Try telling that to Teddy b. We don't have time to babysit the whole-- you were supposed to be watching him. This isn't bullet proof. You got a problem, egan? Is that what I smell running down your leg, boy? Fuck it. Son of a... You just gotta trust me in this, Phil. Can I count on you to go through with this investigation? Phil![tires squealing] [Slow music playing in background] Will that be all? Egan: Uh, that's it. Thanks. [Chuckles] So you think Benson killed Franklin? Well... I don't know, you know. It's hard for me to believe the woman's gonna go in and bash a guy's brains all over the floor. You know, it's a little messy. His wife might disagree with that. What's wrong with you? What are you talking about? Well, something's bothering you. Nothing's bothering me. I'm sitting here, I'm eating a sandwich. I'm having a beer. Nothing's bothering me. Everything's fine. You know, I mean, I act like an idiot sometimes. Yeah, you do.I know. I wanna apologize for that. Ah, it's the scotch. You should know your limit. Right?yeah. You got a pretty nice right hook there. Well, you should see my left. [Chuckles] No thanks. [Chuckles] You know, you should have just told me what you wanted. I really don't want to get into it. I don't want it to turn ugly, you know? If you'd just told me what you wanted, maybe we... I don't know. Maybe things would have been different. You never listened. I mean, maybe I should have taken an ad out on the sports page, you know. Those little box score sections. Like, "the tigers lost" in this column over here. "Harriet wants this gentle, open, honest relationship" over in another column. Wait. Where do you think you're going? I'm gonna walk you up the stairs. [Dog barking] Well, move over, prince charming. [Laughs] Oh... [Unlocking door] Oh, you're still here, huh? Come on, let me in. I just want to talk to you. One drink. Then you go. [Indistinct chatter][Music playing in background] Unlucky seven ball, right? Right. Watch this. Hey, kaz. Listen.Yes! This whole thing with Stuart and Franklin, what do you think? We okay with that? They're just coincidence? A coincidence. Yeah. You know, there's this whole thing with egan. I told you right at the beginning. I don't trust him. Everybody takes, ozzy. Everybody. The judges, the politicians, the stock brokers. Because everybody walks. Rapists, pedophiles, murderers. [Chuckles] Even me and you, ozzy. [Chuckles]See, that's the beauty of the system. It's the American way. So I'm not sorry for who I am. Charlie. Here's to you, Charlie. And here's to your ponytail. [Chuckling] [Starts car engine] [Muffled] Hey![Gunshots] [Music continues] Ozzy. Ozzy! Ozzy! [Gunshot][Gasping] [Phone ringing] Egan! [Phone continues ringing] Hello. Yeah, what's up? What? [Indistinct chatter over police radio] Here you go, detective. Looks like hall and kazinski are off the streets, huh? You know, rid, you talk too much. They found kazinski first. Some drunk comes out of the bar, he trips over him. After I got here, I noticed Billy's car. You're the first officer on scene?Yeah. Where'd you disappear to? Do me a favor. Go inside the bar. Get some details from the people, all right? You got it. Looks like the same mo to me. Better go jump on the horn and get malouf down here right away. You got it.Hey. How're you doing? I'm all right. I'm all right. [Sighs] [Indistinct chatter] You find any hacks on the computer? Got a better idea, Sherlock? Try a little investigative procedure. That thing's a joke. It might come out with some 500-pound buddy Holly impersonator. Well, for your information, wise guy, I'm looking for a common denominator, not a gunman with a guitar. Oh, before you get to your coffee and donuts, I want you to take a look at these. So what? So at one time or another, those guys were under ia investigations. Who the hell hasn't been around here? Half of these guys had bad records before they even got out of the academy. Yeah, but those guys are coming up dead, egan. You looking for a conspiracy around here? I don't know. Well, I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way and hit the streets. Have fun.I will. [Train rumbling] [Train horn toots] Waitress: Yes, can I help you? Uh, yeah, two coffees, okay? You want something to eat? A donut? No, I'll just have a coffee. Just a coffee.[Waitress speaks indistinctly] Wanna sit down? What a guy. Waitress: [Over radio] Guess you guys work around here, huh? You guys need anything else, just yell. Egan: If I had a swing like that, I'd put it in my backyard. Where's your partner? I thought it was best to keep you two apart for a while. You didn't make him a very happy man the other day. He should learn to keep his mouth shut. You becoming a loose canon on me, egan? Is that what I have to worry about? [Chuckles] Just remember, you came to me six months ago and volunteered for this. You know, I don't need to put my short hands on the line to come and deal with a cheese head like riddley. Oh, is that what you think this is all about? We're just a bunch of rats? [Sighs] Picking on your fellow officers. Let's get one thing straight. Bad guys work on both sides of the street. But a good cop always finds a way to get the job done. Whatever it takes.Yeah. That's what my old man used to say until he bought a bullet. You know, I got a $50 moth-eaten flag sitting in my closet. That's all the mayor gave my mother before she died of a broken heart. Hey. Listen. No, no, no, no. You listen. 'Cause I like being a cop. I like getting a paycheck for catching the bad guys and kickin' down doors. See, somewhere along the line, we built this wall. I haven't quite figured it out yet. But you see, you stop feeling things. You don't care about anything anymore. Phil, what do you care about? Is that what you brought me down here for? No. Some of the cops you've been investigating are, uh... Ending up dead. You got any theories on that? No. Do you? I mean, for all you know, I could be doing these guys. I didn't say that, did I? [Chuckles] Oh. I'm talking about working with us as a team. Nothing's ever perfect. And yes, sometimes people do get hurt. But we always watch out for our own. Yeah, I heard that before. Do me a favor. Don't do me any favors, all right? I watch my own cheeks. [Car engine starts] [Sighs] What'd I tell you? All we did was piss him off. [Indistinct chatter over police radio] Diamond 83 to hq. Yeah, I got a code 6. Possible 459 near the corner of Jace and 27th. Code 4. Woman over radio: 10-4. We'll send you backup. [Indistinct chatter over police radio] [Door creaks] [Barking] Man: Becker. [Gunshots][Grunts] [Police sirens approaching] What happened?Took three shots to the chest. His body armor saved him. [Indistinct radio chatter] Thank god I'm breathing. You're gonna be fine. Where's egan?I don't know. I gotta see him. Now. Okay. [Sighs] [Siren wailing] Phil? You home? Hello? [Sighs] [Phone beeping] Uh, yeah, this is Harriet. Is this ed? Uh, yeah, I'm over here at Phil's house. Could you see if he's there? Okay, I'll wait. [Printer whirring] I'm gonna file a warrant. Are you freakin' crazy, McCallister? You expect me to buy this meshugganah theory that egan's our perp? Well, I don't like it any more than you do, captain, but I saw those files and I know that he has motive and opportunity. You don't have a single shred of sufficient conclusive evidence here. Where are these scrapbooks and files you keep talking about? You got nothin' to substantiate this theory. You know that I can't take those files, captain. Not without a search warrant. So, give me a motive. Motive, egan's father was killed under cloudy circumstances. I knew his father. He was my partner. He was a good cop. Yeah, well, some of those cops who he worked with are comin' up victims. And at that time they were under ia investigations...Man: Captain? ...as possible suspects. Nothing was found to substantiate it, so no further action was taken. You're talkin' about some very good cops here. I mean, unable to defend themselves. Well, I think, that remains to be seen. Egan was ten years old when his father died. So?so... So, what are you tryin' to tell me? What I'm tryin' to tell you is, maybe egan held a grudge against these cops all these years. He now has the perfect opportunity to take out his revenge. [Scoffs] Well, that's... That's very interesting, but it's... Somehow a little far-fetched for me. Suppose you hit the streets, find me something I can swallow better, huh? There's one more thing, uh... I think our suspect, Benson, is a witness. Really?yeah. She's hiding 'cause she's afraid. I'm gonna go find her before we find her in a dumpster. Um... I really hope that I'm wrong about this. [Ship horn blowing] [Gun cocks] Becker. George. I got your message. Somebody tried to kill me, Phil. I'm a little jumpy. Comes with the territory. Not this, it don't. You don't look so good, man. You want me to take you back? No. I'm gonna lay low till this thing is cleared up. Did you call anybody else? There is nobody else. I mean, who can I trust? Somebody's doing the whole damn team, man. There's always been a midwatch, Phil. Long before you came around. Yeah, and everybody had an agenda. Some of the guys were tired of the useless system we were bucking. I mean, you'd run a hairbag in, and he'd be back out on the streets the next day. And some of the guys were just crooks with badges. Leanin' on drug dealers, sellin' files and reports to attorneys and scumbags, gun dealing, and shit like that. Whatever happened to doing your job? To protect and serve? What about it? We take care of our own out there on the streets, Phil. We all alone. Now, somebody's doing the midwatch. I mean, 20 years, and nothin', and now this. 'Cause you in it now. Phil? Help me. Look. There's a diary here. It's got everything we ever did, and who we paid kickbacks to. Anything happens to me, you know what to do. Can I trust you? [People speaking indistinctly] [Rock music playing] [Speaking indistinctly] There you go. Hi. So, are you working here, too? I'm misty. And I'm Harriet. Well, I just retired.Bartender: What can I get you? Beverly, let's go. Mmm-hmm. Am I under arrest?Depends. Beverly: Where are you taking me? Man: You can't come in here.Beverly: 20 questions tour. Come on. Beverly: Look, you've got your gun and your badge and the system behind you. I've got my behind and what I know about the streets. I don't need any trouble. I'm looking for a cop killer. Are you a cop killer, Beverly? What? Are you crazy? I don't know anything. Now, I know cinderella didn't leave those pumps behind. And there was no prince charming. When I left, he was still alive. I didn't see anything, I don't know anything, I don't wanna talk to you or any other cop. Take a good look at this man. Don't call the police. Listen to me. You don't have to do that. Maybe I can clear this whole thing up. You see, I... I used to own your uncle. Woman on TV: What? [Knocking at door]Man on TV: I used to live in your house. We lived there for many years. Woman on TV: Well, what happened? Why did you move? Man on TV: Well, it wasn't by hard choice. When my business began to go downhill... [Knocking at door] [Chatter on TV continues] Who is it? [Indistinct chatter on radio][Helicopter hovering] How'd it go down? Three shots, back of the head. [Exhales] Oh, my god, the infamous camping trip. Hey, you got any pictures of us trying to pull cactus needles out of your butt? I gotta go, all right? [Door opens] [Car engine starts] [Lock opens] [Indistinct announcement on pa system] [Ship horn blowing] Hey, Jimmy, have you seen malouf? I think he left. [Telephone ringing] Squad room. Can I speak to detective McCallister, please? Uh, she's not here right now. Can I take a message for her? This is Beverly Benson. Beverly: I'm at the blackstone hotel. Could you please tell her that I need to speak with her? Okay, I'll make sure she gets it. Oh, yeah. That's what it was, yeah. [Speaking indistinctly] [Baby crying] [Knocks on door] Miss Benson? [Knocks on door] Beverly Benson? [Knocks on door] Egan: Miss Benson? Egan: Beverly Benson? Egan: Miss Benson? [Woman yelling indistinctly] [Telephone ringing] I'm coming. Hello? Somebody just tried to get me. Beverly, where are you? Just listen to me. Stay where you are and don't move until I get there. [Siren wailing in the distance] Miss Benson. I'm a police officer. I just wanna talk to you. What are you doin' here? Benson couldn't identify you. What are you talkin' about? I came here to talk to her. I just wanted to protect her. Harriet: From who? You? Egan: From me?Harriet: Yeah. Harriet, what's the matter? Are you all right? Does cop killer ring a bell to you? What, you think I'm doing these cops? Harriet, what's the matter-- freeze it, egan!I got it, captain. Ah, great. All right, toss that gun over in the corner very slowly. Do it. Easy. Now, I want the diary. I know you have it. You're the last one to see Becker alive before I whacked him. You killed Becker? Yeah, he killed Becker. He killed agui, he killed Stewart, he killed Franklin, he killed the whole crew. Don' you know I'm lookin' forward to a career in politics when I retire? Can't take any risk. I hope you understand that better than your old man did. Don't. Or is it gonna be like father, like son? And then what, uh, we-- you expect us to just walk out of here, right? Why not? Yeah, I don't think so. The reports gonna read there was a shootout, you and I got killed, the murder was solved. Case closed. [Malouf laughs] Couldn't happen better. I'm really sorry, Phil. I told you, Harriet. You never listened. I'm really sorry. Get over there. [Grunts] You all right?Yeah. Give it up, captain! It doesn't have to be this way, Phil. You could be a very rich man. Or dead! All you have to do is get out of my way. Not today, captain. You wanna pass, you gotta come through me. You're not being reasonable. Like father, like son, you bastard! Just like your old man. He cried like an old woman, you know. Just before I put the bullet in his head. He was on his knees. Shaking in his pants. He begged me. "Please," he said. "Please, I got a wife and I got a kid. I got a kid." That's all he kept saying. So, I shut him up. [Gun cocks] [Gun cocks] Let's go home. I'd like that. [Sirens approaching]
