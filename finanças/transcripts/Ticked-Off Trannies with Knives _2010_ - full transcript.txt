Whenever somebody messes with you, they're messing with me... Male genitalia... Straight male mentality... She is our designated driver... Matriarch disposition and an unparalleled exquisiteness... Do it for us! Isn't it obvious? * * Nice legs -- what time they open up? Excuse me? Oh, come on, you gonna give up the pussy, or what? I know you got it with you. Gross! Oh, come on, baby, you know you like it. * Hey, tranny! There she is! Bitch! Hey, baby. What's going on? You better strut those pumps, girl. * Bubbles, what are you doing? You're performing tonight. I know, I know! I am! I'm just running a little bit late. I'm stressed out enough as it is. Hey, girl. Hey, honey. You're looking hot today, mama. Fergus is gonna kill you. I know, shut up! I'm going as fast as I can, La'trice. Fergus is pissed! Listen, I'm sorry. Shit! I'm here now. * You okay? You seem on edge. Yeah, I'm late and Fergus is gonna kick my ass. Here you go. Thanks, babe. * (cheers and applause) * * Bubbles honey, come on now, we've got to be on stage in five minutes. Let me help you. Jesus Christ Meryl Streep, girl, what has happened to your eye? Girl, it looks like a shiner. Quintero chingasos. Mija, did you get in a fight? It's okay, don't worry about it, girl, it's nothing. You should put some meat on it. You would say that, ho. Well, girl, doesn't a big slab of meat on your face make you feel better? Yeah, a little bit. Thank you... trust mama pee-pees. Ladies, we don't have time for this right now. You know it's that guy she's dating. I told you, girl, he was trouble. Guys I find always have a degree from the Burning Bed Academy of Farrah Fawcett. I really don't want to talk about it. This is exactly why I'm single... 'cause of shit like that. You're single because you're fat. Guess what? I can lose weight. You can't diet away that ugly face of yours. Jealous. Is that true, Bubbles? That Emma's ugly? Yeah, look. I said I really don't want to talk about it, you guys. Fine, we don't have to talk about it, but let me help you get ready. I got it! Okay... Okay, ladies, it's showtime! You should have duct tape in all the right places. How's everybody doing? Hey, Bubbles. Ooh... Mm-hmm. How you doing? It's nothing, some girl just hit me. Some girl? Mm-hmm... This really pisses me off. I've had it. You know whenever somebody messes with you, they're messing with me. And I don't like anybody messing with my girls. Especially my baby girl. Do you understand me? Yes, mama. So when somebody gets out of line with you, you make sure you let mama know so she can handle that. Do you understand? Yes mama, I do. Now that looks better. You look beautiful. Wow, that's better. A lot better. Let's punch it. Maybe that's the wrong choice of words. This first entertainer is blonde, she's beautiful and buxom -- she's Tipper Sommore! (cheers and applause) * This next young lady has only been in this country for three weeks and she's already learned how to lip-synch in English -- the beautiful Emma Grashun! * She's not a racist, she hates everyone equally. Make some noise for Miss Rachel Slurr. * She is my bubbling bundle of joy, please welcome, welcome, welcome the beautiful Bubbles Cliquot. * And I am your Queen of Cupcakes, the Seductress of Sweets, the Diva of Desserts, I'm your hostess with the mostest, Pinky La'trimm. What's his name? Nacho. Excuse me? Nacho type, girl. Just kidding, Mary, it's Nacho. Nacho like the cheese? Girl, it's just a nickname. I don't even want to know why his nickname has anything to do with a dairy product, I'm sorry. It's just short for his name. Which is? Ignacio. Ignacio? I dated a guy named Ignacio once. Girl, did you? What's his last name? Honey, please, he is not your guy. My exes know better than to date my girlfriends even though they know how much you like sloppy seconds. Well, Miss Thing, it's a pretty common name especially with a Latin familia. You know, my ex-boyfriend Juan, Juan in San Antonio, has a brother Ignacio, they also call him Nacho. Let's see, in my family we have, my uncle, they call him Chemo; my cousins, they call him Coocooie, Doy Doy, Mi Tio Chemito, Gordo, Flaco, Enano, Turnio, Terco, Tastaruda, and a whole bunch of different things like that, girl. It's commonly used like that all the time. That's like 48 too many syllables right there. It's a cultural thing, makes me hungry. That means he's hot. He's going to be over at Trashy Tuesdays over at Weenie Land. You want to come, mama? Trashy Tuesday? Girl, that's tonight! Mm-hmm. No, no, no, listen, we just shook our asses for like 300 people. 400. No, they throw quarters at me! I'm not in the mood! You act like you gotta be somewhere more important tonight. I was gonna go to the movies with some friends that you don't know. Translation -- You're gonna go home and you're gonna bust out the box of those DVDs and watch that "Bionic Woman." That's what you're going to do! Andele! That's what you're gonna go do, girl. And what's wrong with that, girl? Lindsay Wagner was hot before she did the whole jump on the bed, my wine don't spill commercial. She's an icon. Girl, whatever, Miss Thing. Tipper, you coming? Yeah, I'm coming. Bubbles, you going to join us? Come on, Mary, let's go. I'm really not up for it. Come on, honey, a drink with the girls will really help take your mind off it. You'll feel better. The best way to get over a man is to meet another one. Pinky's coming, too. She is? Yeah, she said she's come as soon as she's done shaking her milkshake for all the boys on the yard. Alright, I guess I'll go. Throw on some deodorant and let's go. Wait, wait...So all you bitches are going? Yep, too bad you can't join us. Well, if I knew it was going to be like a sausage party, I would have reconsidered. Wait a minute...So if I would have invited you, you would've stayed home and watched those DVDs of Miss Thing. All of a sudden, all the squirrels wanna come and you want to join? Bitch, that's tired. You're late for doing that. That's so shady -- the house down boots. Well, here's the thing. No, here's the thing. I like you, but one on one, we have problems communicating. Because it's like Charo spitting Fritos at me. I can't understand. Oh! Okay, girl... You wouldn't be saying that if you'd seen the piece of trade that Nacho's bringing with him tonight. Wait, Nacho's got a friend? Yeah, he's coming tonight, he's hot. Oh, tell me his name has nothing to do with the penis. They call him Cheddar-Cheesy Chuey. Jesus Christ, he's uncut. Uncut? What? * * I'm just saying, toots, three and a half months. Oh honey, that's not a relationship. That's a trick that won't go away. Exactly. Yeah, anything less than four months should not be considered a relationship. But I was in love. You weren't in love, honey. The first two months of a relationship is the getting to know you phase. You know, wearing your best costumes, your best hair, your biggest jewelry, all that kind of stuff. It's the next two months that you really begin to see their true colors. Oh, shining through? True colors. That's why I love you. So don't be afraid... I'm not. ...to let them show. Your true colors. Your true colors. Your true colors. Your true colors. You're beautiful like a rainbow. Can I slit my wrists now? Bartender, I need a shot of Clorox with a beer back. Anyway...Back to what I was saying. The third and fourth month is when you really begin to see their flaws, who they really are. You know, that they piss on the toilet seat and then leave it up, it's that kind of bullshit. If you make it through all of that and you're still together, then you can call it dating, only then. Well, that's not going to happen with Nacho. Why is that? 'Cause he's straight. To bed maybe? You really think he's straight? I mean, he acts and he looks straight, girl. There's such a thing called as a straight-acting gay man. I mean, look around. Not here, but like, they're all muscle queens, never mind. Well, if he ain't straight, I think he's one of those bisexual type of guys, you know what I'm saying? Oh honey, you, unicorns, and leprechauns are the only people that believe in bisexual men. Exactly. I don't believe in that either. Have you ever noticed that these self-proclaimed bi-guys are never looking for women? Have you noticed that? Oh bi now, gay later. First he was curious. Then bi-curious. Exactly! Then it was metro-sexual. I'm sorry, but if you wax your eyebrows, you know the words to Wicked, and you suck dick, you are gay. Not metro-sexual, gay! Homosexual, alternative lifestyle representative. Bitches, be proud of it. Okay, Miss Tipper, so what does that make us? Let's see...female qualities and characteristics, male genitalia, straight male mentality, black girl attitude, celebrity fashion sense, warrior facade, matriarch disposition, and unparalleled exquisiteness. Isn't it obvious? We're the solution. Solution to what? Emma's still a dude in a dress with man problems. Bitch, eat me raw. Con queso cabrona. So what are we the solution to? Haven't you heard the story of Eva? Gabor? No ma'am, let me tell you, it's all God stuff. You know, first he created the earth, the moon, the light, all that good stuff; and then creates man. And he calls him Adam. Then, knowing that man is going to be too preoccupied playing with his ding-a-ling by himself -- Did you give her coke again? Really bitch? Let me tell you about God! Because honey, you two are never going to meet him so let me introduce you because I plan on seeing him one day. Alright? So he creates Adam and then decides he needs a woman to entertain Adam. So he takes the rib from Adam and he creates woman and he calls here Eve. But you know, Eve ain't gonna be a little misses at home because she heard about the Lilith lesbian biotch that, you know, didn't want to do with all that and so she's like, "I'm ain't vacuuming your house, I ain't gonna mop your floors and take care of your children." But God said, "No, y'all gotta be the foundation for all mankind." And she said, "No ma'am." And so God went okay, we'll create someone that will be the vision, the intellect, the leadership, the inspiration for all mankind. So he took a ring from the backbone of Adam and a muscle from the heart of Eve and he created a third creature and he called that creature "Eva." Wow. Okay, that wasn't a buzzkill or anything. Maybe. I could use a drink. Who else? Look at the table, bitch, all of us. ALL: Shots! * Hey Pinky, how you doing? I'm good, honey. How are you? Pretty good. Good show? Oh, I was fabulous. Of course you were. Can I get you a buttery nipple or a cowboy cocksucker? Sure, I'd love one, but right now, I'll just take the drink. A Shirley Temple... extra Shirley. You do that so good, honey. There you go. Thank you, sweetie. Put that on my tab, okay, sugar loaf? Hey ladies, what's up? Hey, girl. Miss Grashun's over there trying to get her piñata busted. How's my baby girl? I'm feeling better now. Good, good. Rachel, Emma's actually calling you over there. * Oh God...Alright, don't wait up. Good luck. * Can anyone break this ten for me? I've only got my card. I think I can, hold on a sec. Why? Phantom of the Opera over there, look at him... I think he's new and I want to tip him big. Girl. Thank you. Some girls never change, huh? No, they don't. So how's that eye? Better. You really can't see it in here it's so dark. Yeah, right. We need a cocktail. Yes. What's her nuts...What's the waitress' name? Um, senor? Senorita? My name's Helluva-Bottom Carter, I'll be your waitress. Anything I can get ya? * Hey, sexy! What's your name? It's Flash. Of course it is. What's under the mask. It's five. Five what? Five dollars and you can see. To see your face? That's it? Nothing else? No burger, no fries, no big coffee, no Gucci bag, Prada shoes, nothing, just your face? Really? It's a good thing you're new. * Can you handle that? Handle what? You painted your face just like your fucking mask. Really? That's it? Honey, I must say you've got a body by God but a face to protect it. You owe me 4.50. * Nooch! * Mama? Yeah baby, what is it? Well, um... What is it, honey? Just say it. My eye... Can you believe that guy? He charged me five dollars to see his face and trust me, he is not cute. I want my change back. You didn't see us talking? Rude bitch. I don't know if we should, Nacho, I mean, what if you turn out to be one of those crazy panty sniffers or a rapist, or something crazy like that? That would be bad, Emma. Hey, we can just chill out and relax. You hear that? We can just chill out and relax. Your accent is so continental. I guess so...I live just down the street, about ten minutes from here. Or we could just go to Chuey's place 'cause he just lives right up the street. Yeah, up the street. Hold on, we got a little problem, okay, 'cause we have another buddy and that would make three of us, okay, and two of you. So... Yeah, that's a problem. I'm not sharin' mine. Hey, why don't invite your gringa friend over there? Who? Bubbles? She can't come. She just had an abortion. No really, our other friend he really likes white girls. Hello? Skinny white girls. I don't think Bubbles gets down like that. I don't think she's gonna come, she won't, but we can handle you, we can handle all three of you guys. Invite her and the party's on, chica. Yeah, that'd be perfect. Invite her and the fiesta can begin! She is our designated driver. Right. I have an idea. Come on, girl. * So what are you guys talking about? Chuey. She's going to introduce me to her cousin. To my trade's cousin. You're all related. Shut up! What cousin? And what are you gonna tell him? Me gusta tapanga con queso. No, me gusta tu pinga grande con queso. That's what you tell him. Wait, one more time, shut up. What'd you say? Me gusta tu pinga grande con queso mama. You're going to have to write that down. I will, honey. I'll write it down. Bye, honey. Why is it every time she talks, I immediately want Taco Bell. Every time anybody talks, you want Taco Bell. Love you, Pinky. I love you, too. Bye, Tipper. Miss Thing, watch your step, your dick's gonna come out. Girl, is your face on still? Shut up. I love you, babe. I love you, too, mama. You be careful driving home, okay. I will, I'll call you as soon as I get home. Make sure. I will. Love you. Y'all be careful. Thank you, bye! Tipper, come with me, I left my purse. Don't drink and drive, honey. If you do, drive someone else's car. Hit it, Toots! Vamanos! * We got here quick. Rach, is this the place? This is where they said. Who's place? It looks kinda dirty, girl, but I kinda like it. Yeah, this is it. C'mon, Bubbles. Where are we? Neither one of you guys live here. Get out, Bubbles. Uh-uh. C'mon Bubbles, get out. What's going on? Bubbles...Rachel, you didn't tell her? Well, Nacho and Chuey are here. God, who cares! You guys can stay, I'm leaving. No, they have a friend! Who gives a shit if they have a friend? You know I'm not up for this right now. Why did you guys bring me here? I told you we should have told her, stupid! Shut up, Emma. Listen, this friend of theirs, he's probably super cute. I don't give a shit if he's cute or hot or whatever. I'm not in the mood to meet anybody right now and I'm really pissed off that you guys tricked me into coming here. I'm not up for this right now! Fine, we'll leave, get in the car! No, no get in the car. We'll go buy balloons. Balloons? Balloons, yeah, for your fucking pity party, bitch! If you want to be dopey Doris and piss on everybody's fun, fine, do it! But it's not about you, it's about us! Especially me and my empty asshole! I haven't had dick in a year, okay? Mary! I'm sorry... there are three of them and two of us and we cannot pull a train, okay? We need you. Just go in, grab a drink, say you have cramps and then split. Do it for us! Fine, one drink and I'm outta here. Sickening. Time to party! Do you have condoms? Condoms? I have a whole purse full. * C'mon ride the train Ride it...* What we go through to get her laid. Girl, c'mon, just get it together. I need some tape, it's hot and slippery. Girl, there's no doorbell. Then knock. Okay. Nobody is there. Mary, hold on, hold on. Pizza's here! Oh! They must be Amish, leaving the door unlocked and shit. Okay, this looks shady. It's actually very straight. This is how straight guys live. They're so cute though. We're gonna have a good time. Emma, I'm begging you, please, let's just go. Bubbles, it's gonna be fun. (screaming) Chuey! Hi, how are you? Um...this is my girlfriend Bubbles. Bubbles... Mucho gusto. Right this way, ladies. Nice to see you again. Be social. Nacho. Come here, girl. Sorry it took so long. Stupid Bubbles was giving us a hard time. Something about this doesn't seem right. * What the hell are you doing here? * * What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I was out looking for you. Why? Did you miss me? How can I miss you if you won't go away? Oh yeah. Oh... Looks like you got yourself a little shiner. I swear I didn't think I hit you that hard. He gave you the black eye? He raped me! (snickering) Rape you? Well, that's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is that you lied to me. I didn't lie to you, you bastard! Au contraire mon frere, you did. See, because you made me think that you was a real girl. You put something in my drink and you kidnapped me, you fucker! Only because I thought you were a real chick. How's that one song go? Dude looks like a...a what? A lady. Why do you go around dressed up like a girl, man? 'Cause where I come from, that can get you in quite a bit of trouble. Where I come from, people pay extra for it. Ooh, I bet. Because you're hot. I mean, seriously guys, that is the hottest fucking dude that I have ever seen. Get the hell away from me, you asshole. Feel familiar? Me caressing your legs... your thighs... Pulling up your skirt... Taking down your panties! Could you imagine how humiliating it was when I reached around and felt...oops! Pretty embarrassing. Actually, for a second there, it kinda pissed me off. But I had to finish the job. I mean, a hole's a hole! Am I right, fellas? (laughter) Oh, Goddamn! That kinda hurt. You're pretty quick. Bubbles! * * * I am so cocktailed! You and me both, honey. Girl, I can barely feel my feet. Your phone's ringing. That's my phone? Uh-huh. Where is it? Better get it. Don't hang up! Hello? Hello? Who is it? I don't know. Hello? Honey, let me step outside. I think it's Bubbles. I'll go with ya. I cannot believe I have to leave my cocktail to go outside. Where'd you get that purse? I got it at Ross. Goodnight! (glass breaking) I'm not paying for those. Neither am I. Excuse me, am I in your way? No. Well, you're in mine, bitch! Goodnight! Aren't you gonna take me to dinner? I was? * * * Bubbles, where are you? Bubbles! Who hit her now? * It's okay, don't... Please don't! I don't know! Ping her. Ping her? I don't know what to do with this thing. It's where we have our exact locations programmed to our phones so I can always find her in case of an emergency. That's fierce. What is going on? Got her, got her! Where's your car? This way... Where are we going? We got to get Bubbles! * Pretty smart. Oh, oh, oh! * You sit tight. I want you to see something. * I...please...don't. * Which building is she in? I don't see her car anywhere. Well, according to this thing, she's right around the corner. Turn here! * Where the hell is Bubbles? I was watching you, man, I thought she was knocked out. You were supposed to be watching her! Nacho, get your ass up, come on! Go out the outside. * Bubbles? You in here? * Marco! * This is where you're supposed to say Polo! * Where are you, you little minx? What's that I smell? Do I smell fear? * * Yoo-hoo... Pretty lady? Why don't you give me a sign? I'll do anything to make you mine all mine. * * (metal clanking) * * Dammit! * Oh my God, there she is! Oh my God, Bubbles! What did they do to you? Are you okay? C'mon, get in the car. Get in the car. Shit! Shit man, they're gonna call the cops. Get in the car. * Pinky, come back! We'll go to the cops! No, no! You have to stay here. (sobbing) * Emma! * You hit like a bitch. * Get the fuck off of me! Don't fuck with my girls! (screaming) * * (screaming) * * * * * (moaning) (screaming) Boo! * * * Hey babe. Where are you? I just got here. I'm in the rear entrance. Pun intended. What? You're early? Maybe that whack over the head did you some good. That wasn't even funny. I'm sorry. Fergus got some new girls. They're new, but they'll work. Will you? Oh okay. How are you? How do you think I am? I'm going crazy in my head. What do you mean? I thought you were happy that she woke up. I'm elated that she woke up. It's the other part of filling her in that I'm dreading. I can do it. Really? I don't have a problem with it. That would really take a lot of the stress off of me. So Rachel, what would you say? I would just say, "Bubbles, you just woke up from a coma because the man that once raped you hit you in the head with a bat. And hi, glad you're up." Never mind, I'll tell her. That's what happened! Yeah, I know that's what happened, Rachel, but still. You've got to be more sensitive about this. She's in a very vulnerable state. She's really delicate. You know, you've got to kind of ease into these things. No...I put duct tape on my genitals every day, and guess what, I just rip it off, I deal with the pain. Once, done, snap. You just stand there and be supportive, okay? I'll be as supportive as your jock strap. Oh honey, we are so sorry. We didn't mean to make you upset. We are so stupid. Dummies. But we're really happy you're okay. How do you feel? What are you doing? No, no charades right now. You just came out of a coma, just rest. Maybe she's hungry. Thirsty? Want a cool refreshing beverage? There's no bar here. I have some tequila in my purse. White trash. What? In your mouth? Oh, I got it! I got a king size candy bar in my purse somewhere. Stop being a size queen! Jealous? Don't make that face. No, we're trying. Eye? Eye? Your eye? I! I! Fruit cup. Can! I can...okay. Knot! Knot! I can knot... Speak! She can't speak? Oh my God! Did you lose your voice? She can't talk. * Hi, everybody. How y'all doing? I'm nurse Lingus, but you can call me Connie. What kind of place is this? How y'all feeling today? * You feeling okay? Not so good today? Oh, I'm sorry. Did you drink all your juice? Wonderful, just wonderful... I take it you are her ride home? Uh-huh. That's great, just great. She can't speak. Where did her voice go? I know. Poor little thing just got a little knot on her noggin, marbles fell right out of her head, but she'll be just fine I think, just fine. Oh good, you think. But we can ask the doctor. He'll be here momentarily. Okay, we'll defer to him because he's got a degree. Oh, here he is right now! Dr. Laccio! Morning, ladies. Hello, doctor. Please, call me Phil. Alright Phil, you can feel me. Oh! So what's wrong with her, doctor? She can't speak. Yes, I know... It was caused by the concussion she received from the strike to her cranium. The hit to her skull was so severe and was done with such exertion that it caused her to go into shock, paralyzing her vocal chords, rendering them incapable of articulating vocalization or any reverberation, much less generating any resonance whatsoever. So that means... Bitch can't talk! So that's bad. Could be, could be. How long do you think it will last? Maybe five minutes, five days, five weeks... or forever. Oh no! But she's a fighter, she's a tough girl. I think she's gonna surprise us all. I like surprises. Thank you, doctor. Oh, you don't have to thank me, I'm just doing my job. Just make sure she gets plenty of rest, lots of fluids, and lots of protein. That's what I always say, lots of fluids and lots of protein. You know what... I believe you. * What's wrong, baby? Five? * Sorry baby, but they're gone. But Emma would want me to have her shoes. As if she could fit them. Bitch. Oh my God! What's the matter, baby, you okay? I can talk! I can talk, mama! * Lalala...mememe... I knew you could do it. I knew you were gonna be okay. I'm so proud of you. I love you, mama. I love you too, baby. Okay, now I want to know everything. You don't really need to know about this. Not right now. I do. Do you remember any of it? A little bit. I know I got hit in the head but I don't know by who. It was Boner. Boner? That bath-terd. What did you say? I said bath-terd. Oh my. Oh, my God! I have a beach impediment! A what? I can't dalk! I suck! What am I gonna do? How am I gonna perform? Sweetie, you lip sync. Exthactkly! Oh...why God? Id it becuth I'm beautiful? Id it becuth I'm a hot tranny mess? I hate my life! Hello, you left your door unlocked! Rachel, we're back here! Girl, just relax, it's okay. You're so dramatic, honey, relax. Hey, Rach! I hear somebody got their voice back just in time to start bitching again. What's with the fit, girl? Lith-en to me. Oh, you're kidding me, right? Id not funny, this is embarathing! You just pull yourself together. This is not embarrassing, okay? This is embarrassing! I wouldn't even leave the house! You're lucky I brought you dinner. That was really nice of you. It was, wasn't it? What id it? It's your favorite, smell it. A thalami thandwich? (laughter) Bubbles, it's Fergus! Call me at your earliest convenience. (phone ringing) Before you begin to speak, you should know three things... Fergus, it's Bubblth. Bubblth? Bubblth. Bubblth? No! Bubblth. That's what I said, Bubblth. Bub -- blzz. Bubbles? Bub-bles! Oh, Bubbles, how are you? I'm okay. I'm glad you're feeling better. Thankth. Thankth? Thankth! Thankth? Thank you. You're welcome. Bubbles, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to gather all the girls at your apartment. I'm coming over to take you somewhere. Why? Don't worry about it. It's Poo-Poo Platter Tuesday. Can you do it? But id Wenthday. No, it's Poo-Poo Platter Tuesday. Come prepared. * * Where are we going? I have no idea. Oh, this shit ain't on Goggle Maps, no. Fergus, where are we going? I don't even think Fergus is alive. * Whoa! Whoa! * * Come on! This ain't Bridge Over Troubled Tranny. * Do you know where you are going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you? Where are you going to? Do you know? He'th thcaring me. Child, I'm one step past mortified. * They're like... it's better than yours. Damn right, it's better than yours! I could teach you, but I'd have to charge. * It's the boom-boom pow. Boom-boom pow... * And we're here. Where here? Ladies, we are in the middle of the most precious place on earth... Where the air blows with self-enlightenment -- (farting) Ooh, excuse me...Tacos. Where the air blows OF self-enlightenment. Retreat, groundedness, and the source for the inspiration to open up an immense can of whoop-ass. Um, we knew you were a bitch and all, but where does this whole donkey punch and ninja whore act come from? Rachel-san my darling, where do you think I was going all these years taking my vacations from the club? Vegas? San Francisco? Gay cruises to Greece? No... I was training here with my master, Nam Yo Ho Ren Ge Kyo. He taught me the ways of the warrior. He has now since passed on, but I continued to come here and train and bask in the rays of the gods and their ways. He's not buried here, is he? Rachel-san, my darling, I'm sorry, but all further questions must be submitted in writing Now, wise grasshoppers, you are about to witness something that no one has ever seen me do. I am going to close my eyes... I'm going to do a triple axle backflip bunny hop with a pivot spin with attitude. I'm going to leap into the air, grab the fly with these chopsticks and come down with a falling leaf, foxtrot, undermound, undergrip, split, dismount. You're gonna do all of that? Oh yes, wise grasshoppers. Not only am I going to do all of that, I'm going to teach all of you how to do it as well. Watch and observe. * * (cheers and applause) * * * * (phone ringing) (phone ringing) Hello? Oh hi. Okay, did you? It's okay. Yeah, I'm alright. Only when I'm upset. Okay bye. * * * * * * * * * * (dog barking) * (dog barking) * * That was kinda rude, don't you think? Not even a hello there, a how do you do, or simple howdy could have been said? That's not very ladylike, now is it? Oh! That's right... Maybe that's because there isn't even a lady in here. Fuck you! Tsk...tsk... Such language. Justh leave me alone! What was that? Wait a minute now. You have a lisp. "Justh leave me alone!" Oh my goodness! Up yourth! Now why are you so mad? I'm just here to say hello and see how you're doing after your little accident. You feeling okay? And if you even think about pouring that boiling water on me, you're gonna get something even worse than what you got last time. How do you know where I live? Well, 'cause I'm smart. No, that's not why. Yeah, I'm smart, but that's not how I found out. You see, I heard through the grapevine that you came out of your little coma, so I went a looking for you. And damn girl, you are doing better. Up there on stage, just a jumping and a dancing around, having a good ol' time! Now I got to say, you look even hotter than ever. * What are you doing? Well, remember the last time we were together, you were trying to play all hard to get. Remember that? Leave me alone. Remember when you tried to act like you didn't want it, but you really did? C'mon, we both know that you did. So I had to do what I had to do to get it. I did, right? No matter what happened, I had to finish the job. So now I'm back to finish this job just like I did the other. It's just how I am. Basically, I just can't have you running around all over town spreading rumors, because people might actually believe 'em. And uh...I just can't have that. * (screaming) * (screaming) * * You just insist on doing this the hard way, don't ya? Hey Boner, hey, she's awake. You can keep trying... You ain't getting away this time. Because like you, it's pretty tight. Chuey, toss me the cards. Alright... We're gonna play a little game. This game is called you're gonna choose how you die. See, I just pulled out three cards from that deck and every one of those cards represent something that Chuey's got in that bag right there. So...pick a card. Why don't you just kill me? Because it wouldn't be as much fun now, would it? Pick a card. No! See now, if you were smart, you'd realize that one of these cards is a joker card. Now if you pick this card, that means we're just gonna let you go. You wouldn't do that. Well, sure I would. And why would you do that? Because it makes the game more fun. Can you imagine all that anticipation? Ooh is she gonna pick this card? Ooh is she gonna pick that card? Yee-haw! That's excitement. I don't believe you. Well, I can't lie. I might be a lot of things, but I ain't no liar. Nope, nope, won't let you go. But I guess we could give you a 15 second head start. Ten, give her ten. A ten-second head start. Scout's honor. Umm...but now that I told you about the joker card, I gotta tell you what the other two cards mean. That's the catch. This card is the Ace of Spades, it's black. You know what's also black? A rapper. What rapper? Well, the one that gave me the idea for this type of death... Hammertime! Now if you pick this card, you get to get beat to a pulp. First on places like your pretty little toes there... This big long bone there on your leg. I don't know what it's called but I'm gonna take a crack at that, too. Then, I'm gonna give you a big, big wallop right in the chest. Then I'm gonna work my way up your spine. When I'm done with that, I'm gonna start popping away every tooth in your fucking mouth. After I'm done with that, I'm gonna knock that nose plum off your face. I'm gonna keep on pounding until all your screams are gone. The third card! Queen of Hearts. Now I thought this card was quite appropriate because you stole my heart, and the queen part, that's pretty self-explanatory. Now if you choose this card, I'm gonna cut out your heart. I'm going to start by sticking this through your skin. I'm gonna get on through to that thin fatty layer and cut on through to the meat and I'm going to keep on digging until I get to your creamy little center. Just like how you are, sitting there fully aware of what's going on the entire time. Now you can choose to wiggle around if you want to, but I wouldn't suggest it. I imagine it would hurt so much more than if you just sit there totally still, but hey, that's up to you. So pick a card, Bubbles Cliquot. And don't forget you can still pick that joker card, get that ten-second head start. So uh...which one will it be? The first one. The first one...Let's see what you didn't pick. This one was Hammertime. The other card was... Oh....the joker. I'm so sorry. Alright fellas, hold her down. Might as well get this over with before she tries to make me feel a little bad. Now I imagine after the first few slices, your body will go numb from shock. At least you probably won't feel it as much, I reckon. * What the hell? Boo bitch! * * * (phone ringing) Hello? Hey...We're watching your every move, we're at your back window. But you really need to dust. Oh hi. Everything's going according to plan, don't worry, don't panic. They'll be here soon. Okay, did you? Yes, I forgot to lock the door, don't worry. See, I told you... Shut up. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm alright. Well, you sound so much better. Only when I'm upset. She only gets that lisp when she's upset. And horny. But you stay focused, okay? Okay bye. Stay strong, girl. Bye...We'll see you in a minute. You got bronzer all over my phone, bitch. Looks like he's coming to. Ooh, I wonder if he had any nocturnal emissions. It totally sucks because I would do him if he wasn't like a...raper. Don't remind us. God, you're hateful. Shut up. If I saw you on Facebook, I'd hit ignore and report you. What the hell? What the hell happened? No, Boner, don't! Stay down. I'm gonna kill you bitches. As nice as that sounds, you may want to listen to your Nacho friend. Don't move, Boner, don't move! What's going on? You boys fell right into our trap. What trap? What happened? Yeah, what did happen? I thought you guys were going to bust in the second they trapped me. Oh baby, we did try to but... But we couldn't because of you. Because of me? Yes, we had everything strategically planned but you went and fucked it up like you always do. Fucked it up? What do you mean? You did. I did everything we planned. How did I fuck it up, Rachel? Well baby, you did kinda fuck it up. Please tell me how this is my fault. You locked the front door! Oh, my bad. Oh, her bad. What am I supposed to say? I don't know! How about I apologize for ruining my own fucked up revenge psycho fantasy scheme scenario and I apologize. Fine! I'm sorry. Would y'all bitches just shut the hell up and tell me what's going on! ALL: SHUT UP! So how did you guys get in? Oh girl, you left the window open. Wide open. No, I didn't. Oh shit! You left the window open? Why should I have closed it? I didn't know anybody was watching us! Jesus Christ, man, you didn't think that she would notice that the window was open? Can you shut the hell up and tell us why our asses are greasy? It's because you're Mexican, boo-boo. But we did put some extra grease up there. You bitches raped us? You know, I've seen plenty of Treasure Island media videos that depicted that, but no, we did not rape you. Yes, you did! You shoved things up our asses. Shut up! What? We did put a little something up your asses. No, I wouldn't do that if I were you. You tell me what you did. You know those shiny switchblades that you had? The ones where you push the button and the knife retracts? Well, how do I put this? They're in your ass! Well put, Pinky. Thank you. So the slightest movement and...ooh, that's gonna be a big pain in the ass. And not the good kind. You know, there's a lot of sensitive muscles in there, so I suggest you be very careful. Don't be practicing your Kegels today. Wait a minute... There were only two knives. Actually three. Yours was a hunting knife and I've got that one in my boot. So what do you have in my ass? Ooh, I was hoping you were gonna ask. Okay, so you know that cute little pistol that you got? It ain't shiny no more because it's in your ass! That was my idea! And the trigger looks extra sensitive so any slight move and...POW! (laughing) I'm sorry, did Pinky forget to mention that we pointed the barrel up towards your head? She did, it must have slipped her mind, she's sorry. So...Here's the T -- what we're gonna do is see which one of you can remove your ass plugs without getting killed or hurting yourself enough that you would like to be killed. Chuey is first. There's a catch... I have three cards in my hand and each one represents the number of times we're going to try to make you flinch and tense those inside muscles without making your gun go off or their knife blades spring out. The first one... the Ace of Spades. Since this is the one you like to call Hammertime, we're going to use the hammer to make you flinch. The next one? The Queen of Hearts. If you choose this one, we get ten tries to make you flinch. And with what tool do you ask? Well, what was it you were gonna use on me? Oh that's right, the hunting knife. And last but certainly not least, the joker card. This one represents you, baby, 'cause you're a joker. If you choose this one, we're going to give you 15 seconds... Girl no, you're being generous, give them ten. Alright, ten seconds to get the object out of your ass without any interference from any one of us. Oh, y'all are sick. No, boo-boo, the term is sickening. Not sick, sick is just rude. That is almost the nicest thing he ever called us though. Pick a card. No. Pick a card! The middle one. The Ace of Spades. What does that mean? It means that you're gonna... I mean, that Chuey's gonna have to... Fuck this! This is too complicated! You shouldn't need flash cards for murder. (yelling) Get down there! (screaming and crying) What the fuck? Now I don't get to stab him! (crying) Shut up! You scream like a woman! I need a doctor. Oh, you want a doctor? Well, shit in one hand and want in the other and see what gets full faster. Ahhh! Your turn. (yelling) * Your turn. And now honey, it's your turn. Please, please... Shut up! Por favor... I don't speak Spanish, honey! Let me pick... The Queen of Hearts. What does that mean? Ten. * No...please... Oh shut up! (screaming) Please, take it out! Oh, shut up. Please...please... This little piggy stayed home. (screaming) Please! (screaming) (laughing) Please, please... Fuck this! (screaming) Please take it out! please take it out! (screaming) Please! Take it out! * * Get the knife. * * * * * * * * * * Not today, mother fucker! * (screaming) * Don't mind me... You want to treat us like goddamn tranimals? You're going to be the animal now. Crawl! Go get your knife! Go get your knife! I'll give you a head start. It's fair, right? One... I don't hear you getting your knife! Two... Three... Oh shit, you make good time. (groaning) (neck cracking) Okay, play. * That is unsanitary! * * * * * Oh girl, he's bleeding on your couch. I'll kill him for you. You're bleeding all over that nice white sofa. Didn't think I could get my legs that high, did ya? * (yelling) Anybody move and I put a bullet in her skull. * Chuey, grab the knife. * Chuey, grab the knife! * Alright...Now we're gonna finish this on the count of three, alright buddy? Ready? One... Two... Three! * * I got it! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bubbles! What are you waiting for? What the fuck? Pull the trigger! She won't do it. She can't... Just ain't in her nature. I mean, look at her, such a pretty little thing. You're so insecure. The kind of gal that only feels worthy when... when you're with a guy like me. The kind of guy that treats you like shit. The kind of guy that will lie to her. Be rude and self-centered because that's all you think that you deserve. In some strange way, you're attracted to me. You can't kill me 'cause if you could have, you'd have already done it. If I were you, I would have killed me a long ass time ago! In some strange way, I just don't think you want to. Do you? Boner, you don't know shit! (gunshot) * (gunshot) * * Oh, hell no, I'm gonna get mine. * * * * Do you know what the difference is between us and them? BOTH: No. Me either. (laughter) 'Cause we killed them. I'm hungry. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
