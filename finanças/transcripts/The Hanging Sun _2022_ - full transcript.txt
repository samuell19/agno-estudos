(HEAVY RAIN) (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE BUZZING) John. It's done. Bye, Dad. (PHONE CLICKS OFF) He says it's done. Why would he lie to us? (GUNSHOT) Now it's done. Find your brother. Bring him home. (THUNDER CLAPS) Where are you off to? (CURTAINS CLACKING IN THE WIND) Why didn't you just do it? Would have been easier. I just couldn't. I took care of it. Dad wants you to come home. He'll let this go. I'm done. (SCOFFS) That's not how this works. Stop fucking with me, Michael. Or what? Just get out of here. That's all he wanted.(GUN CLICKS) Do you really want to do that, brother? You were never my brother. GRUNTS: I don't think so. (GRUNTING IN PAIN) (BOTH GRUNTING AND STRAINING) (CHOKED BREATHS) (HE GASPS FOR BREATH) Just money and papers. (INDISTINCT VOICE AT OTHER END, SEAGULL SQUAWKING) Alright. (SPLASHING) (SHIP'S HORN BLOWING, SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) (GLASS SMASHING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ENGINES RUMBLING) Where've you been? It's almost midnight. Been sorting a boat out. Hm. Mean. I'm really tired. (INDISTINCT) I don't care. (CHUCKLES) Mmm. (HE MOANS WITH PLEASURE) Oh God. Oh my God. Oh. Oh. Oh... Aaron, stop. Sorry, sorry. Sorry! I'm sorry! Treating me like a stranger in my own house! BOY: Hey! What's the matter with you? (CLATTERING) Caleb. Oh my God. Get out! Now look what you made me do! Get out! You're being pathetic! (RETCHING) Don't move. I'll burn that fucking house, to the ground. You need stitches. I'll be fine. He can't have got that far. He doesn't have money or a passport. You're supposed to bring your brother home. I tried, Dad. I swear. Everything you and your brother have in your heads, I planted there So don't try and fucking bullshit me. He lied to us. Why do you want him back? Children make mistakes. Their parents forgive them. That's how it works. Would you do the same for me? I just did. Get your eye seen to. Excuse me. (JOHN GASPS) I'm sorry. What are you doing here? This is the property of my grandfather. He's very strict. Do you know where I can get a room? A place where I could stay for a little while? Are you a law enforcement officer? (SIGHS) I'm just a guy looking for a room. Mum! Hmm? There's a stranger who needs an accommodation. We don't have any hotels here. You have to try somewhere else. Just a bed is fine. How long you staying? Few days. Why? Hunting trip. Travelling a little light. Yeah... I left my gear on the train. They're sending it to me. You're going to need more than a few days then. If you want to get any hunting in. Folks don't like smoking much round here, either. I'm sorry. There may be something. Um.. There are hunting cabins on the mountain. You can stay for a few days. It will get cold soon, though. That's perfect. Head up the road here. Um... It's OK, Mum - I'll be happy to accompany the gentlemen. You're not going, Caleb. Um... Keep going round there and you'll see. You'll see it there. Alright. Thank you. Thank you, Caleb. That way. That way, yeah. Why can't he stay at our place? Well, you know why. IN EFFORT: Ooh! He has a gun. So? I thought... We, don't need a man with a gun. OK? (OMINOUS MUSIC) (WATER RUSHING) Seems like an incredibly long way to travel just for some hunting. Not a lot of hunting where I live. I don't if you told me where that is. I didn't. You don't talk very much. You do. That's really a shame, because I don't often find People to exchange opinions with around here. Not that I really know much about the world. Just thought it'd be interesting. Making comparisons with an outsider. I can make it from here. Thanks. But I need to explain a few things first. Hardly anyone ever uses this one. Especially not this time of year. Not... very suitable for hunting. (SIGHS) (EXHALES) Is everything to your liking? Yeah, it's fine. Hey, that's alright. I'd like to get some sleep. How do you intend to... nourish and hydrate yourself? I'll come down to the village. Well... There are two different shops. You can make a wrong decision. Only one is correct. Hnn. If you step foot in the other, you'll end up straight in hell. Alright. (RADIO PLAYING?) Got a car nearby? Yeah. I'll wrap this up then. I can carry it fine. It's not you. It's the people who live here. Not too happy seeing strangers walking around with booze. Not too happy with booze at all, actually. Or strangers. (HE GRUNTS IN UNDERSTANDING) They're fanatics. One ounce of fun you go straight to the bad place. Which makes me wonder what you were doing here. Hunting. Here for the conquest? (HE CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) Um... How does the mail come in? There's a house at the end of the wharf. Are you expecting something? Yeah. See ya. See ya. Take a seat. Do you have children? I would never hurt a child. (MAN HOLDS BACK TEARS) Ever. But if you have children... ..then I'm sure you can imagine the lengths a father would go to find his own. Look at me when I'm talking to you, please. Imagine you're own child disappear... ..and there's a man who knows where he is. But he won't tell you. A man who's helping him. So you might never see your child again. What would you be willing to do To find out what that man knows? Now imagine... ..what I would do. (EXHALES) (COUGHING) Ah! Aah! (THUNDER CLAPS) John. John, Dad's stuck at the dam. I have to go and get him. Can I come? I'll be quick. (THUNDER CLAPS) (INSECTS CHIRPING) (THUNDER CLAPS) Father. (DOOR CREAKS) They found it a few miles from the cave. (FOOTSTEPS) I'm sorry that, Lea. Lord had plenty of reasons to call him back. He'll have plenty of explaining to do. We should pray for his soul. Lord, grant him mercy. And I'll attend to you and Caleb, hmm? Lord, forgive Aaron... ..for the sins he committed on this Earth. ..for he did not always see the pain he caused. Fuck is this place? (DISTANT CHURCH BELLS) (LOUDER CHURCH BELLS) (MAN CLEARS THROAT) Death. Sometimes its embrace is slow and natural. Sometimes we may even look upon it as a liberation. And other times... Other times... ..it arrives suddenly, without warning. But it's never unexpected. The cold, the ice. They're our fickle custodians, and we know that our time here can be cut short at any moment. The Lord holds us in the palm of His hand, And we bow to His glory. And we must reassure Caleb and Lea that, though they have lost A father and a husband, they are not alone. And we will protect you As long as you are with us. For you're in the womb of nature, created by our Lord. (DIRT PATTERING ON WOOD) Hey. Hello. (HE SIGHS) Losing a twin... ..It's unbearably painful. Something you could never understand. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Just like I could never understand the pain of losing a husband. I know you don't feel sorrow. I know you don't. I can't blame you for that. They throw your hat and a picture into a hole. It isn't a real funeral. What happened to him? STAMMERING: He went out at sea... ..and never came back. Hmm. (THUNDER CLAPS) Wait here. What did this one do? He's just lost his parents. Some... immigrants. Hi... Don't say a word. Move. Sorry about that. Good morning. Morning. How can I help? I'm expecting a package. Ah yeah. Name? Miller. No, nothing. Are you sure? You're welcome to check If you don't believe me. Why would I lie to a man I don't know? OK. Thank you. You... You were at the funeral earlier. Yeah. Who told you the mail comes here? That girl. Oh! I know. (INDISTINCT) (CHUCKLES) No doubt a brave woman, but, uh... She embodies the charm of sin. Yeah. Like the man who died. He was a sinner. Got what he deserved. (CAR PULLING UP) (CAR DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING) (INDISTINCT MALE VOICES) No, I haven't seen anyone. Why? Can I help you with something? This gentleman was just asking if we'd seen a stranger in the past couple of days. I told him we hadn't. There's a man who might be hiding out around here. He's dangerous, and most likely armed. It's important we find him quickly. My son hasn't seen him. I have. He was looking for somewhere to stay. Who are you, really? Why are you here? Why are you asking? Cos the police came looking for you. I told them you left. They're not police. Well, they're gone now. Why didn't you tell them the truth? Caleb thinks you're a good guy. That's why I did it. (MAN CHOKING) Please! Ah! (SILENCE) (PANTING) (BABY CRYING) (BABY CRYING LOUDLY) (CRYING CONTINUES) (JOHN GROANS) (HE SIGHS) You're no hunter. What do you plan on catching with bare hands? I wasn't hunting. I saw a wolf. But no one has ever seen a wolf here. I just saw two. What are you doing here? My grandfather would like to have a word with you. Hmm. What's your name? Ray. Ray. I used the conditional as a form of courtesy. My grandfather wants to speak to you. So, if you don't come to him, he'll come to you. Alright. You have a strange way of talking. Is it very evident? STAMMERING: My stutter. No, not talking about your stutter. You said it. I'm working on it. I mean the language you use. You talk like an old man, for fuck's sake. This is my way of working on it. (CHUCKLES) My grandson seems to have taken to you. How long are you planning to stay, Mr Miller? I'm leaving soon. Hmm. I don't mean to be impolite. It's just that we're not used to outsiders staying very long. They tend to bring customs that we find, um, unsavoury. You know. (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) (HE MUMBLES) You see, God placed us at the edge of the world. But the world's getting smaller every day. Distance is not the shield that it once was. Did you hear, a Chinese ship Has navigated the transpolar sea route. Hmm. Soon, everything is going to change. We have only ourselves to blame. See, I have to think about this community. How to stave off the vanity that opens the door to... violence and corruption and drugs, All the vices that consume the rest of the world. You're free to do whatever you like, of course. And I would prefer it if you did it far away from here. Doesn't your God forgive everything? If you truly repent. But that's hard to do when you come all the way to the edge of the world to run away from your sins. What makes you think I'm running away? Go back to where you came from, Mr Miller. Your path to forgiveness does not start here. Hold still. (MICHAEL GRUNTS IN PAIN) (GRUNTING) Why are we wasting our time here? We're not leaving until we find him. Why did you bring him here? Because he's all alone in the world. Is he going to stay with us? You're my son. Nothing can change that. Smile, kid. This is your room now, this is your home. Thank you, sir. Don't call me sir. Call me Dad. Hmm? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC BUILDS UP) Hey, Ray! Hey. I know you're going. Oh yeah? Why are you so determined to go to hell? I don't believe in all that. And if I'm wrong, I earned my place a long time ago. There are different levels. You can at least not make things any worse for yourself. Why do you care what happens to me? Don't people care about each other where you come from? (WAVES CRASHING) Didn't you say we could see whales from here? No, it's not the right season. I just wanted you to know. In case you're here when the season comes. Thank you. STAMMERING: Is that your lucky charm? What? That thing you're wearing. Hmm? I don't know. It just reminds me of my parents. Where are they? They died. A long time ago. They left and never came back. Like your dad. Do you miss them? When I think about them, yes. STAMMERING: I... don't know if I'll miss him. Didn't get along? Sometimes he took me fishing. But... when he was drunk. Hi. Look at me. I never met anyone who got to choose their father. Really? (THEY CHUCKLE QUIETLY) The stranger... Mm-hmm? He promised to come fishing. Did you hear what I said? Yes. You'll be able to fit that soon. Do you think we'll miss Dad? No. (Knocking At Door, Door Opens) Uncle Nicholas. Caleb. Lea. Scuse me, young man. I left something in the back of my car. Would you mind getting it? Yeah, sure. He's grown. Can I help with the tin? Let me... If I can still work one of these. (SCRAPING) What is it? I'm... ..I was thinking... ..you're alone now. You and Caleb. So? I worry about you both. And I was wondering that... maybe you and I should consider... I'd treat you well. Please. Aaron didn't deserve you. You'll think about it? No. Why? Because I don't like you, Nicholas. I'm not like my brother. I... I want you to want me. But I don't. They found Aaron's boat. Apparently his drain plugs were open. Strange you didn't notice before setting off. Ah! Here. This should keep you going. I think we could be really happy. Here you go, young man! No problem. (SHOP BELL JINGLES) Let's go. I don't let my son go fishing with strangers. Did you come here to tell me that? I just thought you should know. Why are these men looking for you? I didn't do something I was supposed to. What does that mean? It's about my father and brother. You told Caleb you didn't have any family. Hmm. The less you know about all this, the better. That's not good enough. It's going to have to be. Better get going. Bye. Don't be afraid of me. I'm not.

Fear... ..is a virtue. It keeps us from danger, from temptation. And fear protects us From the evil we carry within ourselves. And from the wicked voice that makes us confused right and wrong. (BELLS RINGING) It is not reason, but faith that helps keep the monsters at bay. Just like pain, it warns us when we're damaging ourselves. Fear... ..is a gift from God. Today, more than ever, we must learn to be afraid. There are doors that can never be opened, not even a crack, because evil can enter through the smallest of weaknesses. May God protect you. (SPOOKY MUSIC) Meaningful words, pastor. Are they enough, hmm? I understand, sir. The stranger's still here. That's not good. Will you speak to your daughter about me?

(DOOR OPENING) Lea? Where have you been? Fishing with Caleb. Hmm. Where is Caleb? Putting the boat away. Mm-hmm. You shouldn't be on your own. I'm tired, Dad. Better if you were with Nicholas. We can talk about this in the morning. I'm going to bed. Nothing to talk about - I've decided. (CRYING) It was still a remarkable day. Give it to me. Would you want to do this again sometime? I'll think about it. Come on. Ray? Don't you think, at this point in our friendship, you can tell me your real name? John. Let's go. Hey. (YOUNG JOHN CRYING QUIETLY) Just a dream. OK? I didn't want them to go to. They shouldn't have gone! She didn't choose you. The only people that really love you are the ones that choose you. I'll never leave you alone. I promise. They just come late at night. And they can pay a lot for it. I need to get all the money I can to leave this dump. The guy who died, the fisherman? He was my best customer. His brother is a good customer too, though. It's his turn now. What do you mean? Women make no decisions here. I bet they're already getting the wedding going. It's down there. ((BOTTLE CLANKS) Why don't you take two? One's enough. Thank you. (SHE SIGHS) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Mr Miller? Can I come in? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Mr Miller? Hi. Can I come in? Yeah. I, um... I have something. Would you take a seat with me? Had to check. That's my job. So, it's all there. Passport, money. Well, most of the money. I, um... I... I took some in exchange for my loyalty. Of course, if you... if you feel it's unfair, I'll give the money back. Keep it. That's... That's what I assumed. Get out. I'm sorry? Get out. You have a good day, Mr Miller.

Nicholas, it's fine-Shh, shh! You need to go. I'm not going anywhere. (Lea CRIES OUT) I know what I'm doing. Please. (JOHN GROANS, Lea UTTERS A PROTEST) Oh, Jesus. I'm a reasonable man.

Please. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Why could Aaron have her, and not me? To persist with a mistake, even when it is made in good faith... ..opens the door to the devil. I have let the devil into my home. WHISPERS: How have I... How have I... It's in me too. (STORM BLOWING) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Cal? Caleb? I'm here. What were you doing downstairs? That... Wasn't me. (CLATTERING FROM DOWNSTAIRS) I can't believe it either. A boat, filled with water... It was so quick. I stared death in the face. And God lifted me up. (HE LAUGHS) He wanted me to live. (SIGHS DEEPLY) Do you know why? Because he's forgiven me. Caleb. Why don't you go and tell your Grandfather what's happened? Yes. We need to know if the Lord can forgive you too. It's OK, Caleb. Go.
