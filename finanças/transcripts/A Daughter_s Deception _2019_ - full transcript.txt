"Why did you let me eat that last piece?" So who's, who's ready for dessert? Anyone? Okay. Okay This is why Americans are so overweight We don't need dessert every night, dad Yes, we do, every night, daughter - No, we don't - I love dessert Well, then, by all means In Europe, they eat their dessert with their breakfasts So that way they have all day to burn off the calories Is that right? That makes sense - That is a very impressive fact - It is. Thank you You guys expecting anyone? Um, nope All right I'll be right back But you know, here, when we grow up we clean our plates so we have to do the dishes - Hello. Can I help you? - Hi Uh, I... I'm looking for the Andersons Sorry, not us I must have the wrong house Wait. We... we know most of the families on the block. There are no Andersons I must have the wrong neighborhood Um, sorry to bother you Okay "So, yeah, tell me" "Okay, if... If you... If you do that" then mom should be really, really happy and we gotta make mommy happy That was weird What? Who was that? I don't know It was a strange girl at the door looking for the Andersons But I had the feeling she was making stuff up on the spot It's probably nothing It's like that one scary movie Maybe she's gonna come back with all her friends in masks and kill us all You watch too many movies - Don't scare your mom - I'm fine I'm gonna get ice cream - I don't know where it goes - It's unbelievable - I know - Do you want ice cream? Hey... - What's the matter? - Nothing Nothing? Well, your face is telling a different tale, darling What could possibly be the matter? I don't know That's why I'm asking Are you happy? You know, just, like with everything, like, with... Our life and our family? What? I couldn't be happier - Yeah. Are you? - Yeah. Oh, yeah It's just, you, do you ever get the feeling that when things are going really really well you get this feeling that something awful is gonna happen? You know, like the other shoe's bound to drop No, I don't When things are going really well like they are right now... I count my blessings and I enjoy them Yeah We're allowed to be happy You are allowed to be happy You know that - So stop - You stop You stop it Ah! It's the girl from last night Well, we are still not the Andersons Uh, to be honest, I wasn't really looking for the Andersons I was looking for you You are Mrs. Laura Parker formerly Laura Bishop? I think you better tell me who you are I'm your daughter I, uh, I don't usually drink during the day Well, or ever But, um, but today... Don't worry. I understand how much of a shock this must be I mean, I've had time to prepare for this I just, um... I don't... I don't know where to start It's Bree? It's a beautiful name And you, um... You're good? Yes, I'm good Well, before you, uh, before you tell me all about yourself, um... How did you find me? Because they told me that those records were sealed to all parties involved That's just, um... You know, that's just how they did it back then So I'm guessing you never heard of Lighthouse Of The Lost? Well, it's a group An organization, really They believe that adopted children have the right to know the truth about their biological parents no matter what the previous agreement was They helped me find you I hope you're okay with this - Again, I know it's a big shock - No... I mean, yeah You know, of course Look, I know you're not gonna believe me but there isn't a single day that went by that I didn't think of you I was 17... And you know the story I was young, I was stupid I didn't know what I was doing And, uh, and my parents, well... Well, for me, abortion just was not an option I would consider And so I did what... We did what we thought was best for you And your adopted family are they... Are they...? I was one of the lucky ones The Hogans. They're everything you could want in a mom and dad They had a biological daughter my sister before they adopted me Um, they wanted to have more kids but my mom couldn't conceive so they decided to adopt Voila! So you have a family Yeah, I do I have a family I have a husband His name's Michael And I have a daughter named Skylar So I have a sister Yeah Yeah, I guess you do So what now? Well, I'd like you to meet everybody Only if you want I don't wanna... - I just... - No, I... I'd like that - Thank you - Great Great I should actually be going So... Okay Okay Bree, what I said before... You know, about we thought adoption was the best option... Well, we didn't My parents did that without my consent And I never forgave them for that I am so sorry Can I hug you? - Yes - Yeah? We're getting lot of traffic out of Prague, Croatia the Yukon territories in Canada, Tasmania I mean, I don't think that's ever happened for a tech company before Anyway, we're getting 75 percent activation from users with this free upgrade which is great! Well above the normal adoption rate But a little less than we anticipated I had Andrea run the analytics again I'm trying to get a macro view of the situation Really, like, get in there and see what's bugging people out Boss Boss, you listening? Of course You're gonna run analytics I already had Andrea run them a second time Right - Right - What's going on? What, did you and some of the other bigwigs go for one of those three-martini luncheons? Yeah, I wish I... Let me, let me grab this Hey Sort of. Why? You're kidding me Okay, 15 minutes - No, Michael, that's... - Hold on That is the wrong way "Unfortunately, we have some bad news and there's no easy way to say it" "so I'll just get right to it" "Your parents were in an accident" Look, I don't mean to sound insensitive, detectives, I don't but I haven't seen or spoken to my parents in... 20 years We had a... Well, we had a falling out I'm sorry But why is this a police matter? Carbon monoxide poisoning... It's, it's... It's a tragedy, but I... You're right typically, something like this is not But with older couples in older homes it happens a lot more than you might think But... But the piping connected to the furnace was compromised Well, can't that happen from age or normal wear and tear or something? It can. For sure it can But the fire inspector said well... He said it was fifty-fifty Fifty-fifty what? Fifty-fifty that it was done intentionally So you might not have seen them in years but do you have any idea if they had any enemies anyone who'd wanna do them harm? When I was a kid, we went to First Methodist They were very, very active in that church - You could start there, I guess - We tried We talked to some of the parishioners Everyone we spoke to said your folks was just a lovely couple Couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt 'em Right Well, um... Yeah, I don't know how else we can help you I don't know either, ma'am I'm... I'm sorry to say, but... If you do think of anything... Anything that could possibly help us - Here's my card - Thank you You know, the more I think about it the more I'm convinced it was probably just a terrible accident Again, sorry for your loss - Well, thank you, detectives - Thank you Let me show you guys out So if there's anything else you guys need I can help you with just let me know, okay? - Thank you - Thank you All right - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine It's okay to be sad You know, they were your parents You didn't know 'em God! You know, this is, this is just like them I mean, even in death they figured out a way to ruin it for me I just get reunited with the daughter that they took away from me And now this It's just... It never stops, you know? Okay, well... Don't be nervous - What am I supposed to say to her? - Whatever you want Just say what comes natural, darling She's gonna love you She's gonna be nervous, too Okay? So it's our job to just make her feel comfortable I still can't believe you never told me about her Baby, it's not a conversation that you're super eager to have with your teenage daughter And besides, before this, there has never been a reason to tell you Okay Yeah I just, I don't get why she wants to meet us if she has her own family Well, think about it, honey If you were adopted wouldn't you be curious? And we're so awesome as a family - Yeah. Kinda - Kinda? You look beautiful Speaking of awesome... - I'm so excited... - Dad, it's so embarrassing - What? No! Come on! - It's so embarrassing - You're gonna meet your sister - You make me feel bad - Do I look fine? Is this fine? - You look great. Let's go - Come on - Okay - Come on - Fine, fine It's all, like, really, like, strange but different, like... Yeah, exactly Bree, this is, uh, this is my husband Michael - Hi.

Just nuts Uh, Bree, I hope you're planning on staying for dinner, please Oh, come on, you have to - I wasn't really thinking about that - Please Then I guess I am - Great. Settled - All right I'm just gonna order the pizza - Thank you, honey - All right I like your nails Thanks Do you have any polish or nail stuff in your room?

It's complicated Isn't it always? It's nothing, really Relationships are hard Trust me, I know I don't know, I just thought that maybe it gets better when you get older that guys could change Guys change, all right I wouldn't say it's necessarily for the better Does your mom know? - About what? - The guy My parents are clueless All parents are clueless But yours seem really great I guess I always wanted a sister I thought you said you had a sister I do But, you know... by blood Pizza's here, girls Well, come on Let's get it while it's hot - Let's go - All right We have a whole other pizza So there's no shortage So, Bree, um, what do your parents think about you meeting us? I mean, assuming that you told 'em what you're doing of course They're supportive I mean, they'll always be my mom and dad But they also knew that I was always curious about my birth mom And they wanted to help but didn't have any of the information because those records were sealed to everyone But when I found you, they said I should do whatever I thought was best Well, I'm glad you did Yeah, me too Hate to interrupt, but, uh why is my car still in the shop? Oh, just a few more days Yeah - What the hell is taking them so long? - Skylar! It was a recall They had to order the parts Okay, well, I'm staying after school tomorrow to make up for my science quiz so one of you needs to pick me up I'm not gonna be home in time Sorry, sweetheart - Yeah... - You? No, I'm sorry, Sky I have an appointment Okay. Well, then how am I gonna get home? Skylar, I can pick you up - Yeah. Yeah, okay - Cool That sounds great Bree, that's, that's really nice I... I'm just, I'm not sure if that's a great idea I... I think it's a great idea - Yeah - You do? God, yeah! It gives them the chance to spend a little more time together I mean, that is, Bree if... if you don't mind It'd be my pleasure Nowhere to run to, bitch! - What are you gonna do, huh? - Stop! - Get off of me! - What are you gonna do? Come on! You know, I always wanted to kick your ass just because... And now I have a reason, too You think you can mess with my boyfriend and get away with it? What are you talking about? I never spoke with him Wait, wait Are you talking about last night when he was crawling out of my window? - How did you know about... - Shut up! I'm gonna enjoy this Hey, Sky Forgot you were picking me up I thought I was gonna have to take a substantial beating Oh, you will You got lucky, little slut See you tomorrow All right. Sounds great See you then Looks like I got here in just the right time Yeah That's Chloe LoPresti Anyone even glances at her boyfriend and she goes ballistic No one messes with her unless they wanna end up in the hospital Wait, you've gone with her boyfriend? No, no He wasn't even talking to me It was the girl next to me She's just crazy So this happen a lot? Pretty much, yeah Looks like I don't have a long life expectancy at this school Here. Just go to the car I'll be there in a minute Okay Seems like you and Sky have a little issue Something I can help you with? And who the hell are you? I'm her sister Then you should probably mind your own business Maybe tell your sister to mind her own business, too Wow! You're scary How about this? You mind your own business and leave all the other kids alone See, sweetie, this stuff might've worked in high school but you're in for a rude awakening in college Whatever Or at the local strip club Yeah, you'd fit right in at the Leopard Lounge Bitch! That was easy Not so tough now, are you? Now you listen to me, you little skank I'm here for the long haul And if I hear that you're messing with someone or if you even look at my sister you know what I'm gonna do to you? I will carve up that pretty little face of yours and not even the janitor would take you to prom Now do you believe me that I am totally and completely serious? Good I didn't mean for you to take this the wrong way What I meant was we don't really know her... I know everything that I need to know about her Now, I know that she's your biological daughter but that doesn't really mean she's your daughter daughter Okay, wait, what the hell does that even mean? It means that you didn't raise her that we didn't raise her It means that we don't know anything about her values her decision-making how she feels, what she thinks, anything - Yeah - Yeah So we just get to know her better Okay But until then, I really wanna treat her like a member of our family But she's not really a member of the family Yes, she is Michael, I owe her that much Please? Okay, well... If that's what you think no nooky for you tonight - Well, you should be so lucky - Yeah Get your light I'll get your light Hi - Can I help you? - Yeah. Mr. Parker? - Yup - My name is Jon LoPresti It appears that your daughter had an altercation with my daughter at school this past week Well, come in Let's, let's talk Right in here, please Jon? Yeah? Just give me a moment I'm gonna call Skylar down Hey, Sky, can you and mom come down, please? So I'm sure this is just all a big misunderstanding Yeah, I hope so because your daughter made a lot of vile threats to my daughter And Chloe's really really shaken up about it I can't even imagine Yeah, you can't Yeah, dad? This is Mr... - I'm sorry, um... - Yeah, it's Jon - Jon LoPresti - So... What's going on? Well, Mr. LoPresti here says that there was some sort of an altercation at school with his daughter and some threats were made - Sky? - I... I... I think I can clear this up I spoke to your daughter I was picking Sky up from school and I saw her picking on her You know, bullying her pretty badly, actually Who are you now? I'm Sky's sister Mr. LoPresti, is this true? Was your daughter the instigator? Look, I don't know, but I doubt it What I do know for a fact is what you said and the threats that you made you can't just go around talking to other kids like that... Wait, wait, wait What exactly did your daughter say that she said? - She, uh, she... she... - Look I may have been a little harsh Yeah, I'll admit that But when I saw her... When I saw your daughter picking on Sky My sister, who wouldn't hurt a fly I guess I just got a little angry And that is perfectly reasonable Mr. LoPresti, if I could give you a little bit of advice, parent to parent maybe you could have your daughter stop harassing my daughter I will show myself out God! Are you okay, honey? - Yeah - Why wouldn't you tell me that? It's... No big deal It's a big deal - Thank you so much, Bree - Of course For looking out for her Oh, girls! I got your barbecue invitation for this weekend Your wife sent it to me No? I didn't realize we were... inviting What's the occasion? Well, I don't know if there's actually an occasion But I might as well tell you since everyone's gonna be talking about it... This is getting good No, no, no So, um, when Laura was young... Well, before she knew me... She gave a child up for adoption Everything was supposed to be confidential but she found us, the girl She tracked Laura down and so the party is... Are you kidding? No kidding Is she some kind of lunatic? Uh, no, she's... She's actually... She's actually a perfectly lovely well-adjusted young woman, so... So what's the problem? I really don't know Well, I, for one, am stoked to meet her What's, uh, what's her name, anyway? Her name is Bree - Your new daughter? - No, Bree, Bree, Bree Hogan Bree Hogan That sounds made-up Look, I gotta get going and... Don't you have work to do? - Don't you have to go? - Get to work - I pay you for that - Such a good boss Grade-A boss You should get some sort of award Search Bree Hogan H-O-G-A-N Hogan, not cheese Hogan Hi Girls Okay, Tom There you are, buddy - The truth. Lost Lighthouse - "Information" All right, Mr. Tom The truth, the whole truth All right, well, first, let me preface this by saying I'm sure that their internal counsel looked at everything very closely But I'm not convinced that the entire enterprise is legal Leave it to a lawyer to think about the legal aspects of the story That's why he is the best And I mean, the best No, in all seriousness, though, this... It seems that this entire company, this Lost Lighthouse or whatever it's called It was formed solely for the purpose of encouraging people to breach confidential legal documents all right? Honey, you're acting like this is some kind of corporate espionage They're just reuniting parents and children Well, intent is irrelevant, I mean in the eyes of law You know this Really? Okay Well, then why are serial killers punished more harshly than someone who accidentally killed someone in a car crash? Okay, first off, easy, Clarence Darrow - First off - I wanna know In this instant it's just irrelevant, okay? I mean, if you're going to induce someone to break a contract even if your, uh, your... your... your intentions are noble, okay? It's still illegal I'm glad she found us I don't care how it happened - Me, too - Yeah So where is this young woman I've heard so much about? She is... Oh, she's over there talking to Sky Oh, yeah She looks very sweet Yeah, she is You know, it's so funny. Usually, Sky hates meeting new people, right? But the two of them have just really hit it off - Are you gonna introduce us or... - Oh, let 'em be Yeah, I don't want her to feel like she's on display, you know? - Later, later - Well, on that note... Here comes someone who's never been confused with sweet - There he is - Hey - Gareth - Hey, man, Michael Good to see you, man Thanks for coming - Good to see you - Tom, Clarissa This is Gareth Drury He is our top programmer Have you met Tom Caldwell?

Well, it doesn't seem like it I'll tell you what You're a man after my own heart I'm gonna get one No. Sit, sit, sit Please, I'll get you a glass - Sounds good - Sounds good - All right - You gotta watch out for that guy Not too carefully, I hope Well, well, well You must be the one and only Bree I've been looking for you Excuse me? I was hoping you and I could have a little chat later Who are you? I'm Gareth Drury I work for Michael and I have heard a lot about you See... Part of my job is knowing how to actually use the Internet And correct me if I'm wrong but you've not been completely honest with your new family, have you? I'm sure I don't know what you mean No, I think you do Have you told anyone? Well... not yet I was thinking I'd give you an opportunity to explain yourself Thank you Don't thank me yet Well, that was fast Well, I was just pouring it Not distilling it Okay. That's clever Yeah. I appreciate it It's good, right? Yeah, that's nice Thanks, man. I appreciate it - Yeah, of course - Have a seat I will in a minute I still need to use the facility - Two seconds, promise - All right All right - "In a minute" - Oh, come on, man Watering the flowers? Oh, God, you scared me You know, I've been thinking about it Yeah? About what? About what you said You know, you really should've told Michael when you had the chance And why is that? 'Cause now it's too late - It wasn't last time they stayed here - So bad... Sure you'll pay for it... Oh, wait. Bree! Hey, honey Come on over I want you to meet some friends of ours Hey! - This is Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell - Hi And Tom just so happens to be the attorney at Michael's company - He's my hero - Hi - Not really.

It was great meeting you - Yeah, nice meeting you You, too Well, I dunno about you but I could certainly use another - Yes, please - How about you? - I could use one - Yeah but should I have one? That's the question - Do you want anything, honey? - No Gentlemen Nothing? I'm good, honey Thank you You're right, man, she's lovely Who, Laura? Thank you very much - Eyes over here, pal - Come on So I, uh... I thought you could do something for me Just, maybe, look into her Do a background check... Whatever it is that you, you know, you do Why? Are you worried about something? No... No, I'm just... I'm just curious All right, I charge $500 an hour Are you that worried? Well, I was hoping maybe you could just do this kind of unofficially you know, off the books As it were So you're really, really worried Come on, man What is it? It's just all too convenient You know, she just shows up out of the blue Laura is head over heels for her Even Sky loves her I just... I just wanna make sure everything is on the up and up I don't want anyone to get hurt Then why not hire a private investigator? No, I'm not completely paranoid Can you just... Can you just look into it for me? For me Yeah, no... I'm just kidding Yeah, I can See? I knew you were my hero - Thank you. Yeah - Cheers, man I'll have to teach your friends some manners, they are a mess Yeah - Whoa, get it! - Oh, my gosh - Good job! - Good catch All right. Bye, dad We're gonna go help mom - So have fun - Help mom? Helping her... Yeah - Oh, okay. I see it - I think... I think... - No, I got it. We're good, we're good - I think you'll be fine I don't have a choice Detectives - Hi - We stopped by earlier in the day but it looked like you were having a nice little party Didn't wanna disturb you Yeah, just a little gathering with some friends Did I miss something important? - Should I, should I get Laura for this? - Maybe we can have a chat first Somewhere a little more private Yeah, sure I mean, I'm just finishing up here If you guys will just follow me - Follow me, gentlemen, please - Yeah "Hey, Bree Can you help me with this?" Okay, detectives So, uh, what's going on? I'm afraid the odds have changed a bit, Mr. Parker And not in our favor Sorry, I'm not following you The death of your wife's parents if you recall we told you it was a 50-50 chance that it was an accident Well, it seems we now have reason to believe it was intentional Intentional? Afraid so Seems that one of the neighbors under further questioning remember seeing a young woman visit the property on the day of the accident - Well, who was she? - We don't know yet The neighbor didn't get a good look at her Just said she was a young woman Look, there was no reason to suspect that something might have went amiss Detective You need some help over there? No, I'm okay So, um, I just wanna confirm Your wife really hasn't seen her parents in... What, twen... twenty years? - That's a long time - Yeah Detectives, I hope you're not suggesting that Laura had anything to do with this No, no. Of course not Of course not We just wanna make sure that there's nothing... Nothing at all that you're not telling us Like what? You tell us, Mr. Parker Well, like I already told you I don't know anything about this I mean, you guys are welcome to ask Laura more questions if you like... - Nah. I don't think that's necessary - No. Yeah Yeah, we're sure you're right, you know? She wouldn't know anything about this mystery woman We'll let you get back to cleaning up Mr. Parker, do us a favor Give it some more thought You know, something might shake loose It's amazing what people can remember when they need to Hey I thought you got lost Michael? You okay? Yeah, yeah No, no. It's a... - That was a big party - Yeah A lot to clean up Shed was a mess... - Those kids, they can, they can... - I think I should probably get going I... I said that I'd be back for dinner Well, I can probably never eat again, but... Oh, thank you so much for coming, Bree I know that everybody just loved meeting you - Hey, thanks for helping me today - Well, yeah - I'll see you later? Cool - Yeah, totally - All right. Bye - Bye - Thanks again - Yeah Bye, mom Maybe he really doesn't know anything - He knows something - Yeah They don't seem like killers to me I never said they were killers I said they know more than they're letting on There's something they're keeping from us What? That I don't know But I think I'm gonna pay them another visit One when they're least expecting it No way a judge is gonna give us a warrant Not even your buddy Adam and not for something this flimsy Since when do you need a warrant to go for a stroll on a beautiful afternoon? Are you okay? You're just, I don't know... You've been kind of quiet since the barbecue Yes, of course Okay Well, I think everybody had a really good time. Don't you? I do. Congratulations Thank you So... Did Tom say anything? You know, about Bree No, not really Except that she seemed sweet Yeah, yeah, she is Well, I'm exhausted Okay You know, I've... I've been thinking About your parents My parents? I haven't even thought about my parents Why would you? Did Bree know anything about them? I mean, yeah, I told her You know, how... How it was their decision to... Their decision to give her up for adoption Yeah. Why? Nothing, just... Tom put something in your head? 'Cause, you know it's just like him to be suspicious Tom didn't say anything Okay, well, then why the third degree? This is hardly the third degree, Laura All right, well... Look, I'm just too tired to talk about this nonsense Honestly It was such a beautiful day Please don't ruin it "You've reached Gareth You know what to do" Gareth, it's Michael Hey, buddy You're not responding to my e-mails or texts I need you today Call me And I better not hear you're hung over You got that?

He's young Come on, he's... he's irresponsible Just like I assume we were Yes, but not on my dime - Right, right - Anyways. So, uh... What you got for me, huh? So, listen, I... I didn't dig too deep But I, um, I did what you asked me to And, you know, I'm happy to say it's... It's everything she said it was gonna be So... See, it's, uh, Bree Hogan adopted in the State of California, 1996 She graduated from Judd Elementary, went to Memorial High School and attended West Lake College So... That's it? I'm sorry No Apparently, she's also a cannibal with multiple personalities - Oh, come on - So there's that I mean, what... What did you think I was gonna find here? I don't know I just... I don't know Okay, listen, look, this corroborates everything she said, all right? Unless you have other suspicions and a good reason for 'em, man, you gotta let it go - Yeah. Okay, all right - All right? - Thank you. I appreciate it - Yeah. Listen to me I did this as your friend, but as your lawyer you need to get back to work You need to forget about all this stuff All right? It's fine, trust me - A lawyer that says, "Trust me" - Okay, come on I gotta go Thank you Sorry for missing you It's okay, you owe me a drink - Hey, I owe you one - Yeah Yeah I can't believe this This is so ridiculous So I know she only posted that to embarrass me, right? And, of course, she denied it and took it down but Justin had already seen it Of course She's such a... You should probably be careful Yeah, it's just really messed up Look I don't wanna sound like that annoying older sister but you should probably watch what you post on social media I mean, I have friends who lost jobs because their employers saw some embarrassing photo of them online I mean, don't get paranoid Just be smart Yeah So tell me, what's it like? Is your sister upset that you're spending so much time here? We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to No... No, it's okay It's... To be honest, we weren't... Never really that close Must've been hard being the adopted one, huh? Actually, it was quite the opposite My sister always had it harder than me I mean, my parents... They wanted to make sure that because I was adopted, I never felt different So they wanted me to feel like I was just as much their kid as their biological one So what was the problem? My sister, Jessica, she resented that She felt like they favored me So she started acting out you know, try and get attention You know, usually, the adopted one's the one that causes problems but in our family it was the other way around That must have been really hard on you to deal with that You know, for the most part we were a normal happy family I mean, Jessie and I had some great times together It's just, sometimes she'd... Lose it Lose it? Yeah, she, uh, got into some fights We actually had to put her into an institution A mental institution? It's over now But I... I just don't wanna talk about it Yeah. Yeah No, I'm sorry I... I... I didn't mean to pry No, you're not prying I mean, we're sisters - But I do have to go to the bathroom - Okay Yeah Hey, when you get back do you think we could do our nails again? Sure There's polish in my purse - Okay. All right. - I'll just be a minute. That's my favorite Azure Sky, right? Yeah. Right I actually have to go soon I've been wanting to take these classes at the community college and it's orientation tonight - "Great, yeah" - "Thank you for those" So... So I had something that I wanted to discuss with everyone Like what? Okay, so you know the third room the guest room that nobody ever uses? Well, what do you think about turning that into a room for Bree? Have you mentioned this to Bree yet? No, of course not I wanted us all to discuss it first But, I mean, frankly, I thought you'd be a little more excited Sky? Honey, I thought you'd be thrilled - Hey, mom - Yeah? What was grandma's name again? Eleanor Why? What made you ask me about her? Did, did Bree say something to you? She didn't I mean, she didn't tell me anything about them So? What about the room? Not yet, mom Okay? Honey, did something happen between the two of you that you wanna tell me? No, no We're fine, mom Bree's great It's just... It's too soon Well... - It's been almost 20 years for me - Honey... What? - Hey - Hey - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine I'm not the one in this family who's completely lost it Hey, come on. Just cut her a break Look, you know, I like Bree I like having her around She's cool I just don't understand why we have to pretend like all of a sudden she's a part of this family when she's obviously not I know, I know that But just try to understand how your mother feels This is very emotional for her And I realize that you didn't know about any of this And what happened all those years ago, you know, giving up the baby it was extremely hard on her - Yeah - I just want you to know If you ever wanna talk, I'm here for you Okay Thank you, dad - Love you - Love you, too "Coming" - Hi - Hello I'm looking for Elizabeth Hogan I'm Elizabeth Hogan Who are you? I'm Skylar Bree's half-sister - Hi - Hi - Come in - Thank you Sure Of course So, Skylar, what can we do for you? Like I said, a few weeks ago, your daughter Bree showed up at our house She told us she was my mother's biological daughter Some agency helped her find us - I told you something was up - No, you didn't I did I thought it was a new boyfriend You didn't think anything Ignore this one So she was gone more often than normal but... Well, she probably told you this as well - She's just been trying to find herself - Find herself That's what she told us Yeah She's thinking about what to do with her future Yeah, but even when she was home she was perfectly happy And she didn't tell you guys anything about how she was looking for us that she found us? No. I mean, Bree's always been a very private person - Even as a kid, right? - Yeah Yeah, I don't know if that's just who she is or if it's just a part of the adoption... Well, she was only a day old when we adopted her I mean, she didn't even know she was adopted for ten more years I mean, what would that have to do with anything? This one knows nothing about child psychology So it's all true then? You guys adopted her right away? The two of you raised her in this house? Do you have any reason to believe otherwise? I mean, there was one time when in first grade where she stole something Right? Besides that, she's always been a very, very honest child and adult No, no We all love Bree It's just that I wanted to make sure that... Well, that everything was what she said it was You know, it was kind of a shock her just showing up like that Well, I imagine it was pretty rough on her, as well Yeah, no Of course So she still lives here with you guys and her sister? Well, Jessie doesn't live with us anymore She hasn't for quite a while How much did she tell you about her relationship with her sister? She... She said that she loves her and, well, it was complicated Well, Jessica thought we favored Bree Well, we actually may have overcompensated We were just, we were trying to do the right thing We never wanted Bree to feel like she was anything other than our actual daughter But maybe we went too far Oh, no, we didn't go too far I mean, Jessie just needed to be more understanding Well, there's no such thing as a perfect family, right? No matter how hard you try That's for sure But if it makes you guys feel any better according to Bree your family was as close as it gets - Come on, Banks - Hello, detective - Aren't they beautiful? - Yeah Are you sure I can't get you something to eat? Oh, no I'm okay, thank you You know, actually I should probably start heading out I didn't tell anyone where I was going To be honest, I kinda felt a little bit silly about coming here No, do not feel silly at all You are a very mature and smart young lady And I bet, your parents are very proud of you You know what? I think Bree's home I didn't know she was gonna be here I didn't even think of what I was gonna say Well, don't worry about it It'll be fine - Yeah - I hope so - Hi, honey - Hi - Hey - Hi, I'm Bree Wait You... You don't know who she is? I'm sorry Have we met somewhere before? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute What... You wanna let us know what's going on here? Who's this? That's our daughter, Jessica I'm sorry, can somebody explain to me what exactly is going on? I'm sorry Wait! Wait, wait, what? "Sky?" "Bree?" Are you guys home? Sky? Bree? Skylar? Guys? Come on Come on, come on, come on Come on, mom - "Hey, you've reached Laura..." - Mom... "Leave your name and number after the beep" "and then text me and let me know you left me a voice mail" Mom, listen to me Whatever you do do not let Bree into the house She's not who she says she is She's her sister Just trust me on this one Don't let her into the house, okay? Don't let her in Mama's awake Please, you don't need to do this You have no idea what I need None! I am so, so sorry I never ever wanted to give you away You have to believe that You didn't give me away No, I didn't You're right They did My parents did that and... and then when they did that I... I never spoke to them again You have no idea who I am, do you? You're my daughter I wanted to be I wanted to see what it felt like to have a mother who'll love you unconditionally because I never had that I don't understand You... You told me that they loved you They loved their adopted daughter Loved her until they had no more love to give to anyone else When something went wrong... Who do you think they blamed? When one child was chosen for something who do you think they chose? When opportunities were to be had who got them first? Oh, my God! She did You're not Bree You're not... And if it wasn't for you... If it wasn't for you giving her away I wouldn't have had to deal with any of it I would've had all the love from both of my parents for myself Bree, or whoever you are you have to believe me - I... I didn't... - Yeah, I know, I know It was mommy and daddy They made you do it Well, you know what? I took care of that But if you would've kept your slutty little teenage legs closed we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place Mom? Mom? Oh, no! Mom... Oh, God! You have to pay You have to pay for everything that you did to me You... you... you, you can't do this - You can't... - Jessica! Skylar! Run!
