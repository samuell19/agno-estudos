"There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai, unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... perhaps..." Bushido (Book of the Samurai) SATURDAY, APRIL 4 6:00 P.M. Jef? I got here tonight at 7:15 and left at 2:00 a.m. Impossible. Wiener just got back. He phoned to say he's coming at 2:00. Then I was here from 7:15 to 1:45. I like when you come here, because you need me. Call. How long will you be here? We rented the room for the night. I'll be here at 2:00. Save me a seat. Bring cash, in case you lose. I never lose. Not really. - Who are you? - It doesn't matter. What do you want? To kill you. General alert. Routine roundup. Identity checks all night. The killer is described as tall and young, wearing a raincoat and hat. I want at least 20 suspects from every precinct. What's 400 suspects in a city of 10 million? Get a move on. In an hour it'll be too late. Police. Open up. Identity check. Your papers, gentlemen. How long have you been here? Since 7:00. Papers, please. And you? Since 9:00... 9:15. Your livelihood? I get a full pension, sir. I'm a disabled veteran. When did you get here? At 2:00... 2:15. Come with us for a routine check. If you make a legitimate living, you'll be released at once. Let's move it. Silence! Damolini, Ange Séraphin. Gros Caillou precinct. Age 41. Picked up in a bar on Avenue Bosquet with a.32 automatic. Take off your glasses. What have you got to say? Me? Nothing at all. You were carrying a gun. For what purpose? Next. This way. Garcia, Juan, age 47, and Delbarre, Jeanne, age 51. Picked up near Austerlitz station. Man carrying a.32 automatic. Take off your hat. You're not married? Living together? Why the gun? Paris streets ain't safe at night. It's just for self-defense. I'll read your record: "1945, six-month prison sentence for inciting a minor to debauchery. 1950, 12-month sentence for drug trafficking. 1952, attempted burglary. 1955, new sentence for procuring. 1958, attempted murder. 1960, manslaughter. Given the benefit of the doubt." Well? Next. Costello, Jef. Age 30. No criminal record. Fits the description. Not carrying any firearms. The man wore a hat. Put on your hat. It wasn't a hat like that. The hat he wore was darker. No, it was light-colored. But he had a mustache... I think. Why'd you shave your mustache off? I've never had a mustache. I don't think it's him. No, it's definitely not him. Excuse me, but I say it's him. I distinctly remember the silhouette. And you? Yes, it could be him. Where were you between 12:00 and 2:00? At my girlfriend's. The lucky lady's name and phone number? Is that necessary? A suspect with no alibi stays here. Jane Lagrange, 11 Avenue Amiral Bruix. - Phone number? - MacMahon 91-73. Miss Lagrange, please. Miss Lagrange alone. Besides the man outside whom we found at your apartment, did you have any other visitor last night? We're not investigating your private life. You can see whom you like, when you like. That's not an offense. I just want to know if, before Mr. Wiener arrived at 2:00 a.m., you had any other visitor. Who and until what time? Until 1:45. A man. So I understood. Same age as Mr. Wiener? No, younger. Thirtyish? Yes, thirtyish. From what time to what time? From about 7:15 until 1:45. How did you know it was 1:45? I made him leave. I expected Mr. Wiener at 2:00. I understand. And now one last verification. The man's name? Must I answer? Yes, you must. Jef Costello. Excuse me a moment, please. He didn't say he knew the victim? Why didn't you mention that? - It's not true. You'll have to prove that. No, it's up to you to prove the contrary. What you can't deny ‒ for very long anyway ‒ are your regular visits to his club. I never set foot in there. What exactly are you after? Jef Costello's confession to a crime he didn't commit? Isn't that going too far? I'm about to make you change your tune. Call you back. Bring Wiener straight in here. You arrived at Miss Lagrange's apartment at 2:00 or 2:15? That's right. Think carefully before you answer. Did you have the feeling upon entering her apartment that someone had just left? Forgive me for being so blunt, but didn't you feel your spot was already warm? Excuse me? I have to insist. I'm not very observant. That's everyone's loss. But I do remember something. As I entered the building, someone turned on the light. I saw a man on his way out. He walked past me. Come to think of it... he was just a few feet from Miss Lagrange's door. He might've been coming out. Could you recognize him? No, I don't think so. Let me try something. Put on your coats and hats and line up in three rows. Come with me. Stand over there. Switch coats with him. And you switch hats. Come this way, please. Do you recognize the man you saw at 2:00 a.m. in Miss Lagrange's lobby? Do you recognize anyone? I have a composite image of the man I passed. A trench coat like that one. A hat like this one... or that one. And a face like his. Just imagine if you were observant! Come with me, please. That's it. I must ask you both to forgive me. Our job leaves no room for etiquette. Can I go now? Of course. So much for people's private lives! I'm investigating a homicide. I have no choice when dealing with a suspect. Every minute counts. Can I go now too? Of course. Take the lady home. I'd like you to take one more look at Costello. Try to be certain. No "maybe" or "I think." "Yes, it's him," or "No, it's not him." Understood? Bring him in. Do you recognize this man? Did you see him come out of the office hallway? Yes or no. No, absolutely not. Thank you. Step into my office. Do you still recognize him as the man who came out of the hallway? I can answer unequivocally. That's what I'm asking you to do. The answer is yes. Step into my office. Do you recognize this man? No. Frankly, I don't think so. Step into my office. Same question. I'm not sure now. I didn't see the man long enough. Step into my office. I don't know. I'm not sure. I can't give you a definitive answer. Thank you. Step into my office. Now, miss, you're the only witness who actually saw Martey's killer. You were a few feet from him. I can hold him and pick his alibi apart, since he was clearly recognized by a witness... or he walks out of here a free man on your word... and that's the end of it. There's not the slightest doubt in my mind. It's definitely not him. Thank you, miss. It was nothing. Gentlemen, step outside. SUNDAY, 5:45 A.M. Can I go now? I'm afraid so. - How many suspects left? - Nine. Same procedure for them. That'll take care of our Sunday. What do you think about Costello? I never think. 1 Lord Byron Street. He just entered 1 Lord Byron St. I'll drive around to the Champs-Elysées side, then circle back here to see if he comes out. Careful now: 1 Lord Byron St. has two exits. The Champs-Elysées exit is at 116b. - I'll pass it. - Stay there. I'll double-park. He just went into the metro. Tail him. Try, anyway. He got away. What do I do? As usual when this happens, report back here. It's done. I know. But you were arrested. It was nothing. Very well. A deal's a deal. We can't leave him on the loose. He was picked up and held several hours by Homicide. The fact they released him proves nothing. He might still be a suspect. I doubt it. He came up with a terrific alibi. - And if it doesn't hold up? - It's bound to. It's a two-part alibi. I admit they don't come any smarter. That's why we hired him. He carried out the contract: to kill Martey without a trace. He's a lone wolf. A wounded wolf. He'll leave a trace now. No, we have to get rid of him, and quick. Since the police won't find the killer... they won't let him off the hook. Despite his alibi, he's their main witness, by which I mean their main suspect. We'll keep on his trail as well. Make sure he doesn't give you the slip again. Not a single clue, yet something doesn't fit. What's that? I don't know. He's not normal. I can keep the other suspects for 48 hours, but him, no way. - His alibi is airtight. - Too airtight. Wiener's absolutely sincere... but I'm sure the girl's lying. We have to break her so she talks. Then the DA can slap a perjury charge on her. And little Jef Costello... will be sitting in this chair. He'll just laugh in our faces. I doubt it. Ever see a guy stay handcuffed for 48 hours and not open his mouth? I haven't seen many. Stick with the girl, but don't lose his trail. SUNDAY, 10:00 P.M. - What will you have? - A whiskey. If you were the man wanted by the police, one might say the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. May I get in? Why did you say you didn't recognize me? Why did you kill Martey? I was told I'd be paid. What did he do to you? Nothing at all. I didn't even know him. The first and last time I saw him was 24 hours ago. What kind of man are you? But you knew Martey! Not having an alibi makes it worse for you. I was driving back to Paris. With no witnesses! You'll have to prove it. Come with me. - The others? - Nothing. You'd think informers were on strike. - Bite your tongue! Something new. A package Costello tossed in the gutter. - What's in it? - Bloody gauze and cotton. He's wounded. - Know where he is now? - Naturally. I have to know who hated Martey enough to kill him. Why should you care? At the payoff, they tried to kill me. To make sure it won't happen again, I have to find them before they find me. The blond guy I was to meet on the overpass didn't leave me much time to think. I'd like to contact him and his employer. You must know them. They hired you. No, I only saw a go-between. You didn't identify me for one of two reasons. Either you enjoyed playing with the police... or you were told not to recognize me. Arrested, I'm a threat to the go-between. Thus, indirectly, to the man who ordered the murder. And? If he's a friend of yours, I'll find him through you. It's 6:10. Call me here in two hours. MONDAY, 7:00 A.M. Jef? They're just awful. I can't keep them from being overzealous. What do you expect? In the police, promotion means a lot. When I was young, I was overzealous too. - Now you let things run their course. - Exactly. Things fall into place or you give up. Using strong-arm tactics to extract a confession or testimony doesn't interest me. - You don't say. - I'm very tolerant. I'm all for individual freedom. Live and let live. Provided the way one lives doesn't cause harm to others... doesn't disturb the peace, and can in no way be considered an offense against public decency. Isn't that so? - Sure. What are you driving at? Simply this: You declared under oath that Jef Costello was here the night of the murder from roughly 7:15 p.m. until 1:45 a.m. Is that right? - Quite right. Let's suppose Costello wasn't here during those six hours, and I find out. You'll be indicted for perjury, contempt of court, obstruction of justice, and accessory to murder. You'll get at least five years. Five years is a long time. Especially for a girl your age. I'm telling you this... because... I have a daughter your age, and I'd feel really bad. Would you now? I would. You're wrong not to believe me. I think you're a nice girl. A very nice girl. Your behavior in this proves one thing: You've got pluck. Not many women would've done what you did for a friend. Sorry. A boyfriend. You're above reproach. But compared with you, he's no good at all. You seen him since? I figured as much. That little louse! Know where he is now? Want to know? I'll tell you anyway. He's at that pianist's place from the club. They've been inseparable since that night. Seems like true romance. You don't look too concerned. Don't you love him? Well, well. I thought you did. What with all the risks you took for him, I thought you must really love him. You're not much of a psychologist. That must be it. But I figured he was your ‒ What's the phrase? Your "soul mate." While the gentleman... Wiener... was there to pay the bills. It's strange. Girls like you are essentially prostitutes. Ever given that any thought? You should. It could blow up in your face. If the vice squad starts in after you ‒ Those boys mean business. You need to be covered. No pun intended. And you want to cover me? Even better. I want to help you. Get you out of this. Your statement. If you tell me now, with no witnesses, that Costello wasn't here the night of the murder, I tear it up and we forget it. No perjury charge. Nothing. And you won't have to make a new statement. And the vice squad? You have my word. Nothing will happen. I knew you were a smart girl. In other words, you want me to perjure myself, in return for which I'll be left alone. But if I stick to the truth and get in your way, then I won't hear the end of it. Is that it? Not quite. The truth is not what you say. It's what I say... whatever the methods I have to use to get it. So then... is it yes? No. As you like. But we'll meet again. Hang it back up. We made two mistakes. First was to think your arrest was a police trap. Second was to worry you'd be a threat to us. That's why I tried to kill you. But we feel we need to make a fresh start. Here's the remainder of the two million for Martey. Remember: The deal said no problems. Imagine how we felt when you were picked up. But now we want something else. Here's another two million, in advance this time. For the same kind of operation. Another contract. No answer? I never talk to a man holding a gun. Is that a rule? A habit. On your feet. I'll answer you with a question: Who sent you? I'm not free to tell you that. You were free to kill me on the overpass. Look at me. I won't ask you a third time: Who? Name and address. It's no one you know. He isn't like us. Don't try my patience. Olivier Rey. Address? 73 Boulevard Montmorency. That's how you end up out of work. Now about this new contract. He found the bug. He'll be on his guard even more. When he leaves his place, you're to stick to him like glue. Our plan of attack is ready. He knows the metro like the back of his hand. I want flawless surveillance this time. You're in charge of surface vehicles. You cover the metro. I'll give you 50 men and 20 auxiliaries. You'll all wear one of these transmitters. When you see Costello, switch it to this position. When you lose contact, this position. If you pick up contact again, switch it back, and so on. I'll stay here as liaison between the vehicles and the metro unit. Dismissed. Car 11 ready. Car 13 ready. Car 38 ready. Car 41 ready. Here we go. Contact established. Contact broken. He got off at Jourdain. Reestablish contact at all costs! A car to Place des Fêtes, another to Botzaris, a third to Pré-Saint-Gervais. Message received. We're on it. Car 167 to Botzaris. Car 16 to Place des Fêtes. Car 39 to Pré-Saint-Gervais. I was on the wrong side. - What happened? - Boss! - What? - We lost him. - How? - On the moving walkway. He can't have come up yet. I have a man at each exit. Got enough men? No. I'm waiting, but the other cars aren't here yet. I hope he uses an exit we have covered. - And the platform? - Covered. I'm warning you, Jef. This is the last time. Okay. You heard me? I think I did. Well, I had a feeling. Or maybe I just wanted you to come. You in trouble? Because of me? I've never been in trouble because of you. Did they harass you? But what about you? Don't you need me? Yes, you do. What can I do? What can I do, Jef? Nothing. Don't worry. I'll work it all out. What do you want? You got the four million? You accept the new contract? You shouldn't have come. I'm leaving. Don't stay here. Why, Jef? I was paid to. You had a close call. If it weren't for us, you'd be dead. Wrong.
