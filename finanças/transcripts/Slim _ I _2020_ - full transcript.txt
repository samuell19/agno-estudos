Today's rodeo has been approved by… …and all round rodeo champion for 1983. And now, we draw your attention to the arena stage. It's our pleasure to present the man who will need no introduction. Over a span of 40 years, his music has reached out to all of us, he is a legend. Ladies and gentlemen, would you put your hands together for a big Mount Isa welcome to the man who is Australia, ladies and gentlemen, Slim Dusty. Thank you very much, God bless you all! ♪ They say our music's having a revival ♪ ♪ They say that country's on the climb ♪ ♪ But I say what the hell Are they talking about ♪ ♪ Country has been here all the time Sure it has ♪ ♪ Country has been here all the time ♪ ♪ That's right country Has been here all the time ♪ Here it comes. I do remember my first impression of Slim Dusty of being the most Australian sound that I've ever heard. It was almost like, it was like a painting of Australia, those songs. And you know, without a doubt, we would not have the career that we have in Australia in music if it wasn't for Slim and Joy. Slim and Joy were definitely trailblazers and pioneers not trying to sound like anywhere else. I think they were a huge influence. And I see myself in that tradition too of, you know, perfectly comfortable with writing about the things around me and signing in my own voice, but they set a precedent. Slim to me is my earliest guitar memory of… The first thing I wanted to do was sound like Slim Dusty. Things don't change. ♪ If I lived my life again ♪ ♪ I would have it just the same ♪ ♪ And meet you there Beneath the moonlit sky ♪ ♪ And share the same embrace In that dear old happy place ♪ ♪ Where I first saw The love light in your eyes ♪ The road has a certain attraction and a certain pull that you can't get away from it. Oh, it's a great feeling when you know you can just go. And we were just young people, fell in love, loved what we were doing, and I'll tell you what it turned into a lifetime. Yes, I just fell in love with the man not the name. I didn't care much about the name. - Oh, I don't need that, do I? - Why not? Thank you. - That's better. - Too much talking. I was born in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales in 1930. My sister, Heather was born two years after me and so, Heather was a bit like Annie Oakley, anything you can do I can do better. Um, so, when was the first time you heard Slim Dusty's music? Uh, well, I heard Slim, and it must have been on one of his records being played on air. And the next day at lunch time, I went down to either Nicholson's or Palings store and had a look for this new Slim Dusty song album. And that's the one where they printed his photograph back to front. And it came out looking like a fair-haired 40 year old, left-handed and I wasn't really impressed, you know. 'Cause remember mum said, "Who is that?" No, I don't remember that. - She probably did. - Yeah, she said, "Who is that?" And this is when Joy was talking about Slim. 'Cause she knew that you were attracted to Slim, and she was sorta… - I hadn't met him. - …keeping her eye on her girl. - Mm. - To make sure what she was doing. Like who is that man? ♪ When the birds sing gaily ♪ ♪ In stately blue gum trees ♪ ♪ And the scent of blooming wattle ♪ ♪ Floats on the evening breeze ♪ It wasn't country music back, then it was hillbilly music. That was the term everyone called it, you know. And hillbilly music I think in the 1930s was the punk rock of the day. You had lots of cool clothes associated with it. It came from America and also, best of all middle-class snobs hated it. But certainly, it was young people's music and had all those kinds of things that we associate with rock and roll. So, it really was the latest kind of degenerate music form. When I was four, the strangest thing, legs just gave way. So, I crawled then the length of the hall. I was not at all disturbed by the fact that my legs weren't working. But I remember dad picked me up, and he sat me on the edge of the kitchen table. And he would try to get me to lift my legs, and, um, I just couldn't do it. So, the panic set in then. And… I was affectively separated from my family for about three years, having treatment for polio. And the right leg came good. By the time that I was, um, six, I was walking quite well. But I missed the family and… it made me very different. It was because that's a very impressionable stage of your life. See, I used to tinker with the piano and everything from the time I was little. Once I found out how the chords fitted together, Um, I could clap and sing to that. ♪ Hear the curlew cry ♪ ♪ Hear the willow sigh ♪ So, that's how I began, and of course Heather said, "I want to do that too." And so, Heather began singing, and she was a darn good singer too. Mum and Heather from the time they were about 10 and 12 started performing at charity gigs or church dos for fun. We did gigs all over the place. And we had begun recording for Rodeo Records as well. And I wrote the songs that we were recording. I wanna know, what was it about yodelling that got you hooked? Well, nobody had a band. And you had to have some sort of a melody break in between the verses, didn't you? But I think that, um, yodelling was very popular - in those days. Yeah. - In those days, yeah. It was part of the cowboy tradition. - In those days, yeah. - Yeah. It's the guitar solo, you know. Yodelling is the guitar solo of Australian country music. And The McKean Sisters you know, they were the Hendrix's other, they were amazing. And that was The McKean Sisters, and this is Radio 2KY Sydney bringing you another program of Melody Trail. It was an exciting time in Sydney. In, when mum and Heather were in their late teens. Country music scene was burgeoning. Mum was working part-time at Alert Radio in Parramatta, and, um, her boss, Gerry Ormsby ended up getting them a spot on 2KY. When we started out, I think Heather must have been the youngest, um, radio host anywhere, I think you were only 16. Yeah. That was pretty amazing for two young women in that era to have their own radio show, and everyone wanted to be on it, of course. You know jostling, Tim McNamara was a singer and a promoter. And really and truly he was like a superstar in Sydney. He was running these concerts everywhere. Heather and I worked regularly on all of his shows. And mum and Heather had quite a unique act, they were huge. He knew we were drawing power too. There was no one else doing the sort of act that we were doing. So you've been writing music at a very early age. So by this time you've written a lot of songs, do you think how many? Oh, yes! She was always the best writer of the lot, weren't you? Huh? 'Cause I always used to say to Joy, "You write them, I'll sing them." I had the louder voice, but write a song, forget it. ♪ Run coast to coast by night or day ♪ ♪ Hear the clicking of the wheels ♪ ♪ The humming of the diesel On the ribbons of steel ♪ ♪ Carrying the memories Of a nation built by hand ♪ ♪ See the India Pacific span the land ♪ My first job after school was working on the India Pacific as a server boy. And um, I never, didn't know the song at that time I would sorted, came across the song, not much later. So, that was a very nice surprise. You know, liking these songs and realizing Joy wrote that. And uh, Joy wrote this. So, people say, "Ah, they're simple songs." But there's poetry and within like half a verse, you've got a drover waving his grey hat, you've got kids catching yabbys down by the river and a woman hanging her washing on the line. And uh, it's quite a cinematic song, you can see that song. ♪ Oh the Indian Pacific's Rolling down the track ♪ ♪ Five thousand miles to travel Before she's there and back ♪ ♪ From the waters of the western sea ♪ ♪ To the eastern ocean sands ♪ ♪ The Indian Pacific spans the land ♪ ♪ Oh, the Indian Pacific spans the land ♪ That's the end of the song, you should hear the whole song. ♪ In that land of beaming sunshine ♪ ♪ Let me live and let me roam ♪ ♪ And forever I'll be happy ♪ ♪ In my dear old Aussie home ♪ I am just so amazed that my dad was so focused and had his vision from such an early age. He made up the name "Slim Dusty" when he was 11 years old. And he already had his vision to get out of the valley and, and follow his dreams of seeing more of the world. And it wasn't gonna stop, until he made it, till he got there and made that dream a reality and he did. ♪ I'm leaving town today ♪ ♪ And hello open plains ♪ But it amazes me that how he became relatively literate for someone who didn't read a lot. But loved bush poetry and got into the poems of Lawson and Paterson, etc. ♪ A darling old lady Came strolling along… ♪ His father took him to Sydney, remember for his first, um, auditions. ♪ Wish me luck and then proudly say ♪ You know, so his father, being a, you know, fairly rough and tumble bloke, a dairy farmer, um, you know, had a pretty infamous temper, uh, loud guy, called "Noisy Dan" was his nickname. Um, but also, he used to play the Irish, he played the fiddle Irish jigs at all the dances and that he played. So, dad got a lot of his love for music through his father, as well. And then of course, well, it sounds like he had a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. So, I'm sure that was very traumatic. My dad's champion was gone. All of sudden too, my dad, Slim felt it's enormous weight of responsibility to stay on the farm and look after his mother. He felt that expectation, and yet he'd been desperate to get out and do the recording. And of course, wasn't all that long relatively after that that he got a letter of acceptance to go down and actually do the sessions. So, dad rode around the property for a couple of days wrestling with this decision, which was enormous. And finally decide to follow his dreams and, um, thank God he did. So, uh, Tim McNamara said, "Ah, I'm putting together some tours out of town, I want you to come and meet the people you're gonna be touring with." Um, Heather and mum front up. And yes, and the people we were going to be working with of course was one, Gordon Parsons, Shorty Ranger, and Slim Dusty. All of them, they were just blinking larrikins. We were busy keeping them out of trouble, we thought. Oh, this tour, Timmy had one big old black car, and he had to fit, what, let me see, four, seven of us in there. And me and Heather are scrunched up between Slim and Shorty in the backseat. And Gordon had decided to tell us a story. So, he used to turn himself around, and he's little posterior, little whatever, it'd be on the dashboard and then him leaning over the back of the seat telling us stories, you know. We'd be killing ourselves in the back, and it used to look so, I don't know what people thought, all they could see was this posterior - out the front window, you know. - Yeah. Heather, what are your first impressions? What were your first impressions of Slim? Well, my first impressions were, "Who do you think you are?" Because, he was eyeing my sister off, and I wasn't very happy about that. ♪ Just loving you ♪ ♪ Just loving you ♪ ♪ Just loving you ♪ So, I was keeping an eye on him, yes. So, the attraction was there from the very beginning? Ah, yes. ♪ My life would be a mess ♪ I think we might have been in Forbes, one of the towns around there. And my caliper broke through the heel of my shoe which meant that, uh, I couldn't walk. And it was Slim that came and said, "Look. You sit on the car, give me the shoe." And he got the shoe mended. And when he came back, he fitted the caliper, did my shoe up for me. And it was done so gently but without embarrassing me or upsetting my dignity at all. He was a very good man underneath all his shenanigans. And I was learning all these things about him. Slim really was a keen songwriter, and he liked my songwriting. ♪ And if you're ever down Around my hometown ♪ ♪ Will you take a message For me to a little old ♪ And we have been doing this, singing our songs to each other and that sort of thing, and I had sung him one called, "My Hometown". Slim must have gone away and thought about that, and he wanted to know could he have "My Hometown" to record. And of course I measly said, "Look, oh, oh, gee, I'm sorry. But Heather and I are recording next week, and that's on the list we're going, we're going to do it so you know, sorry I can't." And I was quite surprised with the reaction. As I say, he sulked for three days, and I don't think I ever heard a word from him. So, I thought, "Geez, he must've really liked that song". I took another look at the song and thought, "Well, maybe it's better than I thought it was". By the time we got back to Sydney, there was a very different feel there. We sort of knew we had something. I don't think we knew quite what, but… Whenever you saw Joy, there'd always be this shadow behind her, you know, and it'd be Slim. Yeah, he used to always turn up, didn't he? Yes, he was always there. And uh, within 12 months, we were married. ♪ What's it gonna cost me this time ♪ ♪ A broken heart like last time ♪ ♪ Will I have to pay with my mind ♪ ♪ What's it gonna cost me this time ♪ And then, Anne was born in 1952. ♪ I spent a lot of sleepless nights ♪ ♪ Crying the whole night through ♪ Then afterwards, we built a house.

I'd never seriously thought, "Oh, I'm going to get married, and then I'm going to stay home and you know, cook dinner, do the washing and raise the kids and stay…" I'd never actually thought of that, but never thought, "No, I'm not gonna do that." either. I had never actually thought of that, things just happened. And I actively encouraged Slim about the touring because I thought that was a pretty good idea too. We decided that we could do three months. And we started off on the 19th of September, 1954, uh, with 19 pounds in our pockets. ♪ Like a restless wind I had ♪ Anne was… two. And we had gambled all we had, except the house. ♪ And then they're out And I'll be back I dunno when ♪ My brother, Bob set off to put up the posters, ahead of us. In those days, you always had to have some variety in the show. So, they gathered a young guitar player, called Barry Thornton. And he was going to be Mulga Dan, our comedian. And there was Malcolm Mason with his whips and ropes. "At Last! Slim Dusty Show" Hmm. These posters that Bob would put up you'd think the whole nation had been panting for Slim Dusty to appear on the horizon. Talk about naive hillbilly's we were. Slim was really one of the pioneers of traveling right through the country everywhere. So, it was an experience for all of us because it was a learning experience. Blow outs and getting bogged and God knows what, we're stuck for a week, fortnight in one town because we couldn't get out for the rain and, 'cause most of the roads in those days were all dirt. Yeah, the roads were shocking. And you slither all over the place. And your caravan can whip round on you and jackknife. Some of the creaks that we'd cross there was no bridges. You'd just barrel into them and hope for the best. And that was on the main highways. Uh… The shows would come to town, the circus and, there was no TV, there was, in some of the places, they couldn't hardly get radio. And some of them didn't even have electricity. 'Cause back then, there were no caravan parks, so you had to fight to get a shower somewhere. We had some fun in those days. We all had to have a wash of some description. So, there was a cattle trough down the road. Girls first, and then boys. And uh, make-up and hair will be put on by candle light, yeah. It was a spirit of adventure too. You know, we were very young. No, we both had a lot of stick ability. And Slim he got on so well because Slim had a very, very good manager. I'd love to have seen what would have happened to me if I'd had her for a manager. What do you think would have happened? She'd hit me over the head with something for a start. Show time at The Old Regent Theatre, The Slim Dusty and the Traveling Company Band. Get your tickets now and here's a song from the man himself right now. Oh, Joy, I thought she was very pretty. And uh, very office-like. And um, Slim, he's a good bloke, always did the right thing made sure that we all did the right thing, and that's why his show was always respected. Anywhere it went. Every day, most of the time was a new town and new people. And Joy said, "Not allowed out with boys, Margaret. That's the rule, no boys, any boys ask you out, no, no, no." "Oh, yes, mum." Loved her, I still love her, she's all right. On that very first trip if it hadn't been for the Gibson I had, we'd have gone broke there. They were broke, but I think, um, mum's, my nana lent them some money. There was no thought of stopping. No, they had the bug by then. ♪ Don't let bitterness creep in And get a hold on you ♪ Apparently, I was a pretty good traveler. But um, apparently, my first stage appearance happened when I was about two or three, I woke up and just you know, "Where is everyone?" and wondered onto the stage. So, and, uh, there you go. - Thank you! - Thank you. - Come on. - Our daughter, Anne. ♪ Oh, come along the road of song ♪ ♪ Where music may be found ♪ ♪ And I will tell you I'm the light ♪ ♪ You're leaving travelling round ♪ ♪ The home is a way we… ♪ I thought that it was really normal to travel around the countryside playing music for a living and sleeping in swags on the side of the road and cooking stuff on the campfire, and, um, well, I thought that was pretty normal. I thought that everybody lived their lives like that. Well, I thought it was you know, I didn't know it was just us, - Well, it wasn't. - And the Slim Dusty family. Well, what else can we do? You know, we've got no other skills. We could go back fox hunting. That would be really lucrative now. - There was more money in it back then. - True. But I do remember my dad telling me years later you know, we would never have done that if it wasn't for the inspiration of Slim and Joy and all of that. And I like, oh, hey, I loved it 'cause I was getting outta school. I thought it was great, you know. ♪ Well, I've walked a mile Or two in my lifetime ♪ ♪ I've traveled down Some muddy tracks and dry ♪ ♪ 'Cause if I wanted to get Where I was going ♪ ♪ I knew I'd just have to walk That country mile ♪ ♪ Now a country mile Wouldn't be the longest distance ♪ ♪ A man could ever travel when he's down ♪ ♪ And you curse The never ending road before you ♪ ♪ When you think You'll never make it into town ♪ ♪ But if you meet a friend Or two along the highway ♪ ♪ You'll learn a lot You never knew before ♪ ♪ And if the journey takes a lifetime ♪ ♪ When you thought a year or two ♪ ♪ Well, you just don't Give up easy anymore ♪ ♪ Well, I've walked a mile Or two in my lifetime ♪ When you listen to Slim or Joy's songs, you feel like you're kinda there with 'em. You feel like you're part of the family. - Yeah. - It's a very family thing and that, that's something we relate to a lot, I guess. Well, look at what they created. I mean, that is the dream, you know, that really is the dream, and it's certainly inspired us to pack up the family and head out on the road and make music our life. You know, it was just always, their music was always a part of our lives. Fortunately, I was quite happy about traveling. And Slim of course was, quite ambitious for what he wanted to do. And I think he always felt that if he had to be in one place too long, he would never get out of there. And then I realized, started to realize it was very nerve-wracking for Slim to come into Kempsey, his home town and ask his mother to come down to the show. Because, after his father died, he was 17 years old, and it was assumed that he would look after his mother, and he would run the farm. And he wondered whether he should have stayed, well, he knew he shouldn't have stayed, he would never have been happy. But he did feel, that he had disappointed his mother, and she blamed me for pulling Slim away. What she didn't understand was that he'd gone anyway. And he might have ended up in not so good hands as mine. ♪ Whiplash ♪ The next thing, Frank Foster from the Foster family on the show ground came to see Slim. And he said that The LeGarde Twins were leaving to go to the States, and he wanted Slim to join him as the star of the show. Joining up with Frank Foster you'd stay in one place for maybe a week or two weeks, and you'd have time off in between the shows too. Which was, um, a real change for our family. And um, mum and dad decided it could be a good next step. Oh, when I was a young boy, the big entertainment event of the year in a place like Grafton was when the show came to town for a week. Uh, it was all just part of you know, last week was boring, next week's gonna be boring, but for this week, you know, it's not boring. You know, there's stuff happening. There's fair, there's lights. In the show ring, they are actually showing off all the agricultural, uh, products of the region. Uh, that's on the hoof. But if you're a kid, you're not interested in any of that stuff. What you're interested in is all the stuff in the tents. The rifle shooting and in the boxing tent. And amongst those, uh, the side show alley tents, there would be Slim Dusty's tent. It's like a, it's a cowboy show. So, we would live on the first run, and it was the big show run from Sydney right up to Cairns, but, before we left, Slim had to finish a recording session, and he was one song short. And that's why he asked Gordon Parsons, his mate if he wasn't doing any recording now, could Slim record "Pub With No Beer". Now, Gordon Parsons, a good mate of his was aware of this poem about this pub that had run dry of beer. It was a legendary tale, up in Ingham in Queensland. Strange things happen here in the Outback. My old friend who wrote that song, is here with all our trucking mates today. Let's give a big hand as he comes out with his guitar, to the yodelling bushman, Gordon Parsons, my old mate. How are you, Jack? There's nothing I wouldn't do for Ned, and there's nothing he wouldn't do for me. And that's how we go through life, doing absolutely nothing for each other. - Right, thank you very much. - Would you like sing along in this? You can do the next verse you like about the stockman. Hey! ♪ Well, the stockman rides in With his dry dusty throat ♪ ♪ He breasts up to the bar Pulls a wad from his coat ♪ Well, originally it was a poem, but everybody knows about that, but Gordon Parsons wrote the tune to it, but Gordon also wrote a lot of extra verses. Slim never ever sang a comedy club song before, and he always wanted to. Yeah, that was funny because Gordon wanted to record it badly, but Slim badgered him until he said, "Okay." he said, "You can have it." so, 'cause they were great mates then. But I think had Gordon recorded it, it would've went nowhere. It was just that Slim had a bigger following, and he had more connections than what Gordon did. And they were able to push it a little bit and get it going. This came out of the blue. "The Pub With No Beer" success just came totally out of the blue. And it took Allan Lappin, the disc jockey and then Bob Rodgers to hear it and to play it before it suddenly went up the charts and sold, and sold, and sold, and sold. ♪ It's lonesome away From your kindred and all ♪ ♪ By the campfire at night Where the wild dingoes call ♪ Everybody had their country music albums hidden under the nearest rock. It was the first time that Australia allowed us to have an international hit, it just went berserk. Back in those days the way Slim was going it wouldn't have surprised me what Slim did or how high he got, 'cause he had the potential there. Well, I thought so anyway. The song made Slim, but Slim made the song. What is it about the song you think? Why did it catch fire? I don't know, because to be honest with you, I hated it, and I still do. Because nobody could quite imagine that a country, a country and western song could do this sort of business in the city. And not only in this city but in London city, and in Dublin city and in other cities in other parts of the world. ♪ He sat by the door Of the grand old Birdsville Pub ♪ ♪ His swag and gear guarded By a faithful heeler dog ♪ Country songs are often, they tackle one subject. And just making it poetic, you know. And memorable and simple. Songs that people can sing. A simple song is the hardest one to write, and that's the genius behind it. And I think, um, their songs always put you in a physical place. It's songs that people can relate to and say, "Oh, I know somebody that's happened to or I know somebody like that. Or, I'd like to be like that." It's sort of part of you. Slim and Joy's catalogue to me made me feel like I belonged to something. And I think one thing I noticed about Slim and Joy when they created music and whether it was Joy by herself or whether it was Slim with other writers, they had this simplicity. And until a few years ago, I'd never really stopped and broke down the song. Sometimes it's like a motor, you've got to pull it apart to see how it works. Like for instance, when Joy was in G shape… …uh, to put a B7 with a G in a country song was something that you just don't hear about, and she pushed all the boundaries with it. ♪ I rode on trucks and trains And lived on nothing ♪ ♪ Served me right for wanting to be free ♪ ♪ Oh, well, that's the way Society looked at it ♪ ♪ But it didn't seem To be that way to me ♪ Back to the G, who does that? Joy McKean does that. But Joy bent all the rules, you know, and she broke a few when it came down to bush ballads, and I still do whenever I write a song. If it's in that vane of the traditional country thing, I always think well, what would Joy do right now? Where would she take this song? It's an amazing song.

And my mum sat me down and a part of my punishment was to listen to that song. Because, she said if I don't pull up the way I'm carrying on at school, I'm gonna end up being the biggest disappointment of the family. And that was what she used as part of the, the lesson. And it stuck with me too because I was always looking at the lyrics of it then a little bit closer, and as I got older, I've started playing it live. Because, it affected me that much, and it wasn't just because of that broken window. It was because of you know, I've got a lot of times in my life when I've felt like I was a bit of a disappointment you know, when I was bumming around in my car trying to make a living out of music. But the song followed me around like a good mate, until I got a chance to record it with Slim, and I thought, "I'm not that anymore. This has come full circle." There's lots of memories that come along with Slim. Because of what's Slim's given me as advice, as he told me to run my own race when I was a young fellow. "Put the blinkers on in a horse race, run your own race, don't look left or right." He said, "Run your own race." ♪ I just couldn't be the person They expected me to be ♪ ♪ And the biggest disappointment In the world was me ♪ Still am the biggest disappointment. And I've talked to the young kids, you know, if you're worried about what everybody else is doing, that's what Slim would say, "Don't worry about it. Just do your own thing, be who you are, you know." And he never said it as young and hip as that. It was just, it was a real old bushy way of saying, "Put the blinkers on and run, straight." All right, you're right in good time now, people. The Slim Dusty show is just about to spring into action. Look through the doorways there that's where the action is. If you're show going people... Look, my job was helping Franky do the dragging, we call it spruiking. We've got Joy McKean from the famous McKean Sisters. ♪ I'd be… ♪ ♪ I'd be… ♪ All of a sudden, I knew my dad would become famous. 'Cause dad's wearing a white hat. People are just pouring in the doors of the tent. Exciting, you know. And this flashy white shirt with two gold records right here. So, it was anything but quiet while all this was happening. Frank was having the ball. He'd had all this publicity to handle. The show was going great, he couldn't do a thing wrong, and everything was just like that. We travelled from Hervey to Darwin from Perth to Brisbane. And you're going from nine o'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock at night. And 25 shows a day… And forget about meal break. You can't have a meal break in the main day of a show. And with that the singers with Slim, he'd be in the back there, scoffing as much tea as he could. Because, by the end of the day, your throat is really red. Mum was you know, flat out 'cause she was working in every show, doing the ticket box at the front. That must have been exhausting. It was exhausting. I was asleep in the sawdust one time at the Royal Easter Show I'm telling you. I was, I was dead to the world out at the back, and I was just in the sawdust. But you know what I mean. Still was, the blokes went round and did what they did, and the girls made the cups of tea and all the rest of that. I thought, boring. ♪ I think you've heard the story Of the pub with no beer ♪ ♪ Saddest story… ♪ Then when we left Sydney, and we headed North. Yes, things got, yes, that's when things got a little bit outta hand. Merle, Frank's wife was having her first baby. Merle was Princess Firecloud. She had to be replaced, and it so happened that I was pregnant with our second child, with our son, David. That meant you know, okay, new staff. So, we hired two new usherettes, two nice looking blonde girls, and, um, Frank and Slim used to take them down to the pictures. You know, quite happily too, with a blonde on his arm and all the rest of it. You know, that was the attitude those days. So, as I looked around and realized that these influences could affect my little family, I began making it very clear that I was onto everything that was going on, even if I wasn't. At one stage, I sat Slim down and said to him, "Look, Slim," I said, "You want to remember they'll be gone next month, I'm gonna be here for you all the time." And honestly, that gave Slim a really big shock. It took me a good while, but when I grew up I grew up a lot on that showground when I knew I had to save my family. And there began, I suppose, the toughening up of Joy. And finally, we decided to go back onto the night show. And from then on and of years to come, we developed this mentality I think, the four of us against the world. ♪ For that big green Engine's ready to go ♪ ♪ Rollin' out of town tonight ♪ Because, we were the core of what he wanted. ♪ See her steam and hear The whistle scream ♪ ♪ And we're off on the northern line ♪ He had his career, and he knew he had the love of his family. ♪ Rock 'n roll along on time ♪ He felt that he was a very fortunate man.

Um, went to an all-girls boarding school in, um, in Randwick, which is a bit of a culture shock coming off the showgrounds I can tell you. We had the show on the road again. And it was just as we did that that television came in. Some picture shows closed. Dry cleaners were going bust. Because, people didn't go out. Anyway, we had, um, a sharp-shooting, whip-cracking act with us Keg Young said, "You ever gone to the West, the Western Australia?" And he said, "TV hasn't really hit there yet." So, that was the start of the big round Australia trips. So, I was born in '58, and then I was traveling for the next whatever, five years and doing the you know, round Australia tours with 'em. Uh, and traveling in the car. I mean I remember just you know, being in the car. You know, because we'd travel, I went across the Nullarbor like five times… …by the time I was six. ♪ See the paintings ♪ ♪ Of the children ♪ ♪ That are children ♪ ♪ Of this land ♪ When they went out on the road, they would go to places that nobody else had gone to. They really did beat a path. That and in the 60s is when they started going out to all the aboriginal settlements in the Northern territory as well. And not once, but regularly, they would go back every year. No one else as doing that at that stage. It was an absolute commitment. Leading up to eventually round Australia trips for 10 months of the year. And I've spoken to people who were members of indigenous bands in Australia like Colored Stone and Warumpi Band and No Fixed Address. They came of age listening to Slim. They thought Slim was an absolute hero, because he kept coming back. ♪ Their tribal songs ♪ ♪ I see the children ♪ ♪ Of this country ♪ ♪ They will not stand ♪ ♪ All alone ♪ ♪ I hear the footsteps ♪ ♪ Of the children ♪ ♪ Comin' home ♪ I've never… I've never met a black fellow that doesn't love Slim and Joy.

I mean he was out on the road like us you know, he was earning his living on the road like us. ♪ And the children ♪ So, they were passing black fellows all the time, on the road and going through towns, stopping in towns, and yeah, we kinda claimed them as our own in a way. ♪ Of the children ♪ ♪ Comin' home ♪ I've toured quite a lot in, you know, outside the cities and, uh, in remote country areas and aboriginal communities. I haven't toured nearly as extensively as Slim and Joy did. They went everywhere. But I started to realize, I started, when we were going out to play more remote places, that it was really handy to have a Slim Dusty song you know, or two in your pocket. 'Cause, I remember playing at Yuendumu, 2003 or 2004, it was not long after Slim died actually. And we were playing a bit of footie out there, so I was standing around in the dark, and then two old aboriginals stopped me and came up to me and one of them said very quietly, "Play Slim." And I knew that wasn't a you know, a request, that was an order. So, uh, you know and I knew a couple songs so we did play Slim. They love Slim everywhere around the country you go. They remember when he came. That's their legacy. Where are you planning to go from here? Back to the rat race really. But I like fishing and we, Joy and I like traveling and camping out when we can so I guess that's why we'll always be traveling. ♪ Find the sign and follow the sun ♪ ♪ Maker of the land, maker of the soil ♪ ♪ Maker of the constitution ♪ - Oh, hello! - Hey, Slim, welcome back! ♪ My blues tonight ♪ ♪ Let the smoke clouds fly We're saying goodbye ♪ ♪ Gonna lose my blues tonight ♪ If you've gone off road into an aboriginal settlement, and you've travelled in there, and you've seen the joy on the faces of an audience that never sees people or that hadn't up until that stage ever seen people come out and do a show. Often down on the back of the truck with a generator. I mean they didn't write their songs away from country. They wrote their songs on country. They experienced it. It connects white and black. And their music is home. And whenever I hear them, I'm back there in an instant. So, yeah, well, I, I've never forgotten them. And I thought when I came back to Sydney that I you know, I was too cool for school and I could forget about Slim, but I used to get so homesick, and… and get pissed and listen to him all night, and I'd be okay the next day. - Hey, that was good. - And they were singing about aboriginal people too which was usual. We received a letter, and it was from a 14-year-old girl called Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr at Daly River Mission. And she said, "We weren't able to come in to see the show in Darwin, but if you will bring your show to Daly River, we can pay you… five dollars." Slim said, "Well, for goodness sake, you know, what can we do?" It was such a great letter that we decided to slip in and do it. And I took the five pound because it was the correct thing to do. - Yeah. - But I said, "Next year we'll be back." And I said, "I will do my show, and then you do your show." But of course that led to them meeting some people, Harry and Regina Wilson out at Peppimenarti. Which became a very special place for, for mum and dad and their connection with Harry and Regina and all the people out there. While Harry invited us here on a holiday trip about four years ago, and we came and we did some fishing, we did some hunting, and we visited the waterfalls, and we camped out up on the wildlife with all the people here from Peppi. It used to be cattle station before. - It was. - We started, me and my husband started Peppimenarti. So, before I left, Harry said, "Well, we'll put on a corroboree for you." So, I'm sitting over there in the shack, and I thought well I better do something in reply. So, I wrote the Peppi song. My husband and Slim was in a boat at Moyle River and Slim wrote a song on the boat. So, you and Slim sang that night. - That's right. - "Plains Of Peppimenarti". That's right. That song is really special to us. And it's a song about the people here. It's about old Peppimenarti which is their spirit.

And you had to go and line up at the local post office. Probably in the only public phone booth there was in the town. Well, you can imagine how distressing it would be. And there'd be a lady in there chatting onto the neighbor uh, three miles away sort of thing. Looking and sounding as if she's going to be there until midnight. And sometimes when we were rained in, Anne didn't get a letter for about two weeks, and the teachers found her in tears in class. With David we were moving six times a week and as he got older, I needed… I needed help. I thought right, there's the washing, the ironing, the cooking, the looking after David, doing correspondence lessons, doing all the booking of tours ahead, doing the publicity, organizing that, driving a vehicle. Anyhow… …the problem was, we'd say to David for instance, "You know, why don't you go and play with those little kids there?" And he said to me one day, "What's the use, we'll be gone tomorrow." So, he was, had no friends, no friends, there were no other small children in the show that time. And so, that's why we made the, one of the reason why we made the very difficult decision to send him to boarding school when he was only not quite seven. And that was terribly difficult. He was only six, six and a half. But yeah, boarding school I didn't mind. Ninety percent of the time I enjoyed it, could've enjoyed it all the time, I ran away three times. So, eventually, I got sick of it. Uh, yeah, there were certain times that you wished you had your parents there, there's no two ways about it. Yeah, you miss that, yeah, that's right. 'Cause you fly in for two weeks and then you go again, and you're not gonna see them for another three months, yeah. As a mother myself now, I, it was so tough on my mum and dad. But I mean I remember it was always really exciting flying in but when we had to fly out, I can still remember it, and it wasn't, it was tough. I get emotional just thinking about it. Not that I'd ever wanted any other way and, um, and, um, and I was aware that's just the way it was, you know, that was our life. - Hey, Bennie, how are you? - Good day, Slim, welcome back to Bowen. - Here we are again, Anne. - Yeah. My first job was to carry the gold records across the stage as dad was being introduced you know, well, "Pub With No Beer" man. And then I progressed to my own spot in the show at about 15.

And she took care of all the things that he didn't have to take care of. And the show ran like clockwork you know, clockwork. Thank you, Joy McKean, here she is right now. Thank you, Slim. Here's a song which, just for change instead of writing for someone else, I wrote for myself. And it's written from the memories that I have of a farm that my mother came from. ♪ My great grandfather built his house ♪ ♪ From slabs of timber strong ♪ ♪ The women bought The slabs he built each day ♪ ♪ The homes did ♪ Without Joy McKean, I don't know that Slim Dusty lasts for more than ya average performers life span. I actually suspect that we wouldn't be having this conversation if it wasn't for Joy. And why do you say that? 'Cause I don't think Slim would have got past "Pub with no beer". The combination of the two of them was what lead to him becoming a legend. Joy's the driving force behind the whole thing. It was perfectly obvious to us that Joy was the organizer, the boss, hmm, mostly the boss. Anyway, I was in awe of her you know, "Here are the motel rooms. You're there, you're there, you're over there. We'll be up at so and so, we'll be eating over there", blah, blah, blah, blah. I, I think she was quite capable of sitting down and negotiating contracts with companies without any lawyers there. And I don't think they would have stood a chance, you know what I mean. ♪ Ceiling clean With white wash every spring ♪ And um, their bands were always in uniform. Always well dressed. And she would have a look before we go on stage. You know, have a good look and if your shirt was wrinkled or not ironed properly, she would tell you. It was like inspection time before you hit the stage. But you knew that you know, you didn't mess around with her, we knew that. You know, to get carpeted in the office. We were like school kids. School kids. The first time I met him was just as a fan, I guess, um, at a concert. And that's, that was the thing about Slim you know, sometimes his meet and greets were longer than the actual concert. But I think underneath it all, I think he's a very humble, family man. I don't think he wanted the star adoration, it didn't seem that way to me. And that's the thing about the hat, he wouldn't wear it around the towns 'cause he wouldn't get recognized. It's amazing to see, but when he took that hat off, people wouldn't know it was him. I went antique shopping with him one day, and no one picked him. You know, but as soon as he put that hat on his head, he became this icon. ♪ We'll have to stick together Now if we want to survive ♪ ♪ Sometimes I think our women folk ♪ ♪ Don't know that we're alive ♪ ♪ Now sister Anne is growing up ♪ ♪ And starting to fly round ♪ ♪ We'll have to stick together now ♪ ♪ It's a case of swim or drown ♪ ♪ How about the day we thought We'd go out in the boat ♪ The best times that I ever remember as a kid with my father was down in Victoria at Metung. Mum and dad built a house down in the Gippsland area of, uh, Victoria, in the early to mid 60s, and that was their base. So, Metung to us is our real first family home. And so, every year, mum and dad finished in November or so. They would get the caravans there. We'd have Christmas holidays there. And dad and I would go out fishing you know, before dawn. That's when I think he was most like himself to me, and that's what I always remember as a kid. And he loved the lifestyle down there. But a little too much mum thought, I reckon. He was getting very involved down at the pub with… with the fellows and mum was thinking, "Hey, wait a minute! I thought this extended time, we're gonna have more family time. A bit more down time, spending it with us, with me and the kids." They needed to shake things up a bit, and I think mum saw this. So, mum instigated moving to Sydney, and it caused a lot of friction at the time when we first moved up. I know from talking to Slim, that he was always nervous about "coming to town" as he termed it. Because he just wasn't sure, how he was going to be received. And worried that people would you know, effectively as Australians do, take the piss. You have to remember that we had gone through years and years and years of the sling offs about hillbilly's, hay bales, hicks and singing through your nose and all the rest of that sort of thing. Everything got swept away in that tide of Rock and Roll. It had become our life, and we could make a living out of it, but I wanted him to just stay in Sydney, so that we could cut back on the touring. We could even work in clubs, you know. So, really for Slim's career, the move to Sydney made sense. How many months of the year do you still travel around? Well, I've been traveling for most of the year, about eight and a half months but I think it's a bit too long. I'm a little bit old now and getting a bit tired. Like, you know, it catches up with you. You a bit fed up now with traveling around the country? Yeah, I'm fed to the neck, I'm just a bit fed up now but, uh, after I've been home about three months I want to go out again, you know what I mean. Yeah, well, what do you think of city life? It's terrific for about three weeks. You wouldn't come to town if it wasn't for the records I suppose at all? Oh, yes, I would yeah, I like to live it up occasionally. The 70s was an explosive time musically and creatively for mum and dad. And the recording was all based in Sydney. And um, I had thought that'll work beautifully. Didn't work so well. And um, Slim was… a bit toey. Yeah, people talked about dad being a living legend you know, and mum well often used to laugh and say, "Yeah, you should try managing or living with a legend." You know, it wasn't easy at times. Like harnessing this restless soul that was hard to keep him happy. He was working on songs, but he wasn't, you know, driving from one town to the other or forming or whatever. And before long… …the rot set in. ♪ I don't want no woman around ♪ He whinged, he moaned, he didn't want to do this, and he didn't want to do that. He did not want to do anything to cooperate, family-wise, particularly wife-wise in any shape or form. Quite frankly my beloved Slim was about impossible to live with. I got fed in the neck with him, ah, dear me. So, mum had to get cracking and organize some more tours. ♪ With land and sky and lots of room ♪ ♪ A thousand miles or more ♪ ♪ I rev and point old purple ♪ ♪ On the Nullabor ♪ ♪ They say, "Good day." ♪ ♪ They say, "How I am? ♪ ♪ You're getting thin on top ♪ ♪ You've been travelling Do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Will you never Will you never ever stop ♪ Looking back on it, I think my dad was very focused on his music. Whereas, mum was looking very much forward in directing the major milestones and movements in their life and their career to really reach that peak that they did. And she had a very amazing sense of harnessing that raw power that my dad had, to direct it through the decades, uh, to its best outcome. If he had a song, or he had an idea, he would always see what Joy thought of it. He would run that idea past her, he would listen to it, he'd ask her to look at the lyrics, see what she thought of it. I guess he was, to be honest, I suppose it was more on his actions that he showed how much he respected and loved her more than what he said. And she… had such love for him that she was fiercely devoted to him. And she saw his gift as a musician as something precious and something that she wanted to see always be protected and developed. I was driving a small station wagon and pulling a fully loaded caravan as well. On a mountain road on a black rainy night. The station wagons those days had the dimmer switch for your headlights was on the floor. But I only have one foot to operate in a vehicle. My left foot is completely paralyzed. As I'd be coming up a hill, and the semi's coming over the hill would be on full beam. I'd get it in the eyes, it'd absolutely blind me for those few seconds and then from the accelerator across to the dimmer switch, down with the dimmer switch, back over to the accelerator, before the car stalls. And then, as soon as I'd get passed there then do the whole thing again, put the full beam up. So, I could see where I was coming to the next corner, and this went on for hours. And I thought to myself, "If I go over here, how long is it gonna be before Slim finds me?" And that's where the story came from because then I had to keep myself awake, and the windscreen wipers were going backwards and forwards all the time. Gets very rhythmic and can put you to sleep too. And I remember saying to him, "I wrote a song on the way up." "Oh, well," he said, "you better put it down before you forget it." So, she puts it down on a cassette. When we got to Metung for Christmas time I pulled the cassette out, Slim had already got to it and run over nearly all of the song, rehearsing. And he was saying, "Well, you can just write it again." So, I could've killed him. We got Slim to record it, against his will. ♪ It's a long straight road ♪ It was the first big trucking song for Australia. I didn't know that there was a trucking music scene. But that was a real turning point for her. She won the first golden guitar at Tamworth for that song.

My mum really did challenge my dad with her song writing and the songs she wrote. She was pushing him to get out of his comfort zone. Sure, she pushed him all right. You know, there was a note that was a bit hard or a bit, and he'd flatten it out, and she'd be going, "No, no, no, that's not how I wrote it, you've gotta sing it this way." ♪ Too late I see he post And I haven't got a ghost of a chance ♪ ♪ Ah-hah-hah-no ♪ ♪ The windscreen wipers Are a-beating in time ♪ ♪ The song they sing Is a part of my mind ♪ ♪ And I can't believe It's a-really happening to me ♪ The "Lights on the Hill" again, there's something really interesting going on in that song.

The feel of a truck driver going over the edge and dying to a really happy little Cajun feel, Joy pulled it off. But I guess when something like that does happen, it does happen sort of like this in slow motion. So, the song is almost like, "Ah, well, I can't do anything about it now, this is it." So, there's this kind of acceptance. But that's all in the writing, and it's very beautiful. And um, that's the skill that we're all still trying to learn. We'll get there one day. ♪ I can't believe It's really happening to me ♪ ♪ Oh, but I'm over the edge And down the mountain side ♪ ♪ I know they'll tell About the night I died ♪ ♪ In the rain when the lights On the hill were a-blinding me ♪ That's the genius with that kind of song writing, you don't think I'm writing a sad song I'm gonna have minor chords or where you can contrast the music and the words you start this tension. And that's the great thing about "Lights on the Hill" too, there's a, the music and the lyrics are at odds, and I love that kinda writing. Classic. And so I thought, … … "I've made it." I'm a Slim Dusty writer. And after that, I was able to do it a lot. And the company then, they wanted to be more in touch. They wanted more and more and more stuff. I used to sometimes picture Slim… …in between the covers of an album, squashed in like a piece of product. Oh, what a shock this is. With more awards than he could throw in a swag, and three million records sold, "That Country Mile" is paved with gold. What's the bank balance look like now? A lot more healthy I'm happy to say. Is Slim Dusty a millionaire? Oh, not really. EMI was a British record company and with that carried a certain pretentiousness. Country music was looked down on, it didn't exist. So, what was the state of country music? It was the biggest selling music that EMI had. But they just put it out and just reaped the profits that came from the bush. The bush was another world. ♪ I sing about the things I see around me ♪ Slim, hold it a sec. Hold it, Slim, you can't see me, but I've got a surprise for you. Right now, you're on national television. I'm Mike Willesee, Slim Dusty, "This Is Your Life". My memory is being a little bit in awe of him 'cause you should be, and you have to be, and I was. But the fact that there's 60 years and more now of recorded music that's out in circulation and selling, is incredible. It's arguably the longest relationship any major label has had with any artist ever in the whole world. It wasn't by accident that Slim became that guy. There was no artist, I don't care what the genre is, no artist, um, bigger and more profound than Slim. We always joked that he was the artist that we built the company on. In the early days when I first started working with Slim, he had a contract with EMI which demanded two albums a year to be recorded and released. But they were both driven, and they were equals in a lot of ways too. Neither of them could dominate the other. So, they were really a team. And my wife Joy, uh, she is mostly right, and I'm mostly wrong. I didn't wanna record "Duncan", but she said, "No." And it goes something like this. ♪ I love to have a beer with Duncan ♪ ♪ I love to have a beer with Dunc ♪ ♪ We drink in moderation ♪ ♪ And we never ever, ever Get rolling drunk ♪ ♪ We drink at the Town and Country ♪ ♪ Where the atmosphere is great ♪ ♪ I love to have a beer with Duncan ♪ ♪ 'Cause Duncan's me mate, hey ♪ Change key. ♪ I love to have a beer with Molly ♪ And when the unsolicited songs and everything were coming in, I was the one that would go through them. He really, really enjoyed recording. And he loved to go in there and put it down on vinyl, on disc, on tape, whatever. It is one of the things that I think separated him from so many other country artists was Slim's embrace of the evolution of country music. His recognition, him and Joy's recognition of the evolution of country music and that in order for it to survive it's got to be able to evolve. They really understood that, and I know that's why Slim wanted to take me out on that tour. ♪ It's a long straight road And the engine is deep ♪ I don't know I'd always done a cover of "Lights on the Hill," and the song is just bulletproof. I mean it's such a really well written song. And somewhere along the line Slim heard this version we were doing, and he reached out to me. He said, "Hey, we should do a new recording of that song. The two of us." And then we, um, he said, "Why don't you come out on tour?" And I said, "Ah, you know, I don't think the audience, you know, will go for that. I don't think they'll like it." And he said to me, "No, what they won't like is if you're not being true to yourself. They won't like that. Do what you do, that's why I brought you out here." So, that night we just did this full on set, cranked it up, and the crowd went nuts.

And yet, along came a lot of the younger people that they inspired. They had 'em under their wing within a minute, taking 'em on the road. Maybe he was worried that someone else would you know, uh, take his spot. He was incredibly ambitious and competitive. You know, both of them were, they're very ambitious and competitive. You know, they were very supportive of lots of you know, of all these up and coming young country music artists. But they certainly wanted to make sure that they kept there above 'em, don't you worry about that. I cannot imagine recording 107 albums. That's insane. I mean, I guess they lived it and breathed it. ♪ You won't find me In the busy city street ♪ And their albums were like a diary of that touring, country life. ♪ You may think it's me But have no doubt ♪ ♪ No, you'll have to look for me Much further out ♪ ♪ When the sun sets… ♪ All these people out in the bush, you'd almost think that they were waiting for Slim. For someone like Slim to come along. When they discovered that they could write about their lives, and if it struck a chord with Slim, he would put their story out there. And once they realized that, stuff began to pour in. We became a part of all these different towns, you know. They both had an absolutely unshakeable, God, I'd almost call it a mission that they wanted to give rural Australians a voice. And so, in a lot of ways, it's folk music to me. A lot of ways it's, um, especially those early records. It's documenting what's going on out there. And as I say, Slim was no, you know movie star. In appearance, behavior, or anything else. Therefore, it wasn't a case of gazing at him from afar. It was the sort of feel if they could walk up to, if they wanted to and say, "Heard a good story the other day, and I thought I'd tell you about it." 'Cause that's what used to happen to us a lot after the show. ♪ There's no movement today At the station outback ♪ ♪ Just a man with his head in his hands ♪ ♪ He'll soon walk away Just the shirt on his back ♪ ♪ Things are not the same on the land ♪ I worked in a fresh fish shop. While I was there one day cleaning up, uh, my uncle, Kevin Chambers came in and said, "Slim Dusty's on the radio, he's looking for a song. The farmers are in a serious drought, he needs a song." That night I wrote the song called, "Things are not the Same on the Land". Put it on a cassette, posted it to Slim. About a month later, he rang me up and said, "I'm gonna record your song." It's the best day of my life, I can still remember it. I thought, "I'm gonna be rich!" 'Course that didn't quite happen. But uh, it still was the best day of my life, I was so excited. I knew his songs were verse, chorus, verse, chorus. A little guitar turn around. So, I wrote the song specifically for Slim, and he sang it just how I imagined that he would. ♪ Promise of a rainbow Won't feed a hungry child ♪ ♪ Things are not the same on the land ♪ And those songs that we picked up and worked on, it's a picture of what it was like for people during all those challenging times. That's why he used to despair that he couldn't get all these good songs down and get them out there. ♪ We've had two world wars ♪ ♪ And the fighting is still going on ♪ ♪ We're due now to think ♪ ♪ That we live On the brink of destruction ♪ ♪ Since man made the bomb ♪ ♪ And our leaders talk peace ♪ ♪ But their speeches Aren't doing too well ♪ ♪ If they don't call it off ♪ ♪ If they don't find a fault ♪ ♪ They're gonna blow Themselves right into hell ♪ I don't think you ever really make it I mean you can't afford to sit in the sand, you never really make it. I just change direction and keep going. On that same six-week tour with Slim another motel, drinking another cup of tea… …on the little patio area, we had, I think we had three more shows to go. It felt like we'd been out there for months and months and months and months. And I said to Slim, "Ah, three more shows to go." And he smiled and he took a sip of tea and he goes, "Hmm. Yeah, three more shows to go." And he was bummed, but he immediately went, "But we're already thinking about the next one, mate." He was ready to go. He wasn't a person who could just travel and do nothing, except look at cathedrals or you know. Dad started to have trouble with his voice. And he was a worrier, he was inclined to worry, Slim. Dad had to keep recording, there was all this pressure. Even if he was sick, he would still try. And this went on for eight years. And it must have been hellish. Ah, you know, 'cause he lived to sing, and mum knew this. So, it was incredible stressful time for mum too because she had to find a solution. There were times at the studio where things would go off the rails. And uh, but he was a volcano. We knew the signs when he was about to erupt. We learnt that on the road. Combing the hair, taking the hat off, rolling the sleeves, putting the hat back on. All that, and I don't think he was aware that he was doing that, but we knew. I think dad needed protecting from himself. He was impatient, he was very impatient. There was never any talk or inkling of stopping what they were doing. He wanted to be relevant, he wanted to remain absolutely important right up until his passing. I sat him down, and I said to him, "Look, I don't know what going on, but you are going to have to stop getting in these rages. Because, haven't you noticed when you get in these rages, you're then breathless, you're white. Thank you very much. And actually you're really unwell for a day or two. Dad not singing, dad not recording didn't even cross your mind that would happen. He had a studio at home, and he'd go in and just put tracks down, and it got to the stage where Slim actually couldn't get up there. So, we just kept the process as much as possible. Kept it going. And he just wanted to, he had rhythm to go on you see, it's… And of course that's when they found that he had the kidney, um, kidney cancer. Well, to us he said he was, you know, he was going to beat it. But Slim wasn't going to give in. Really, um, he sang up until a week before he passed away. And then when he couldn't sing anymore I think that was, he didn't wanna hang around. And to me, he's the only person I cried when he died, I was devastated. When you think about the things that he and Joy did, they were fearless, absolutely fearless. But I think you know, her genius was, um, forgotten a little because she'd married an icon. There was a tendency, because he was so much larger than life, to forget that those brilliant songs he was singing were written by the woman by his side. ♪ They had my future Wrapped up in a parcel ♪ ♪ And no one even thought of asking me ♪ ♪ The day I turned 15 I took the mail train ♪ ♪ To find out what else Might be in life for me ♪ ♪ Well, I rode on trucks And trains and lived on nothing ♪ ♪ Served me right for wanting to be free ♪ ♪ Ah, well, that's the way Society looked at it ♪ ♪ But it didn't seem To be that way to me ♪ ♪ And the biggest disappointment In the family was me ♪ ♪ The only twisted branch Upon that good old family tree ♪ ♪ I just couldn't be the person They expected me to be ♪ ♪ And the biggest disappointment In the world was me ♪ ♪ A lot more dinner times Than there were dinners ♪ I do remember him always saying to me, "That's the best song you ever wrote." ♪ At the time ♪ ♪ But this quiet country boy came home ♪ I understand a lot of what Slim went through.

And I had immense pride in him to think that he did what he did, and he got himself where he got to. And it was a unique partnership, and it was a very special one. It always came back to the songs. ♪ As we start to look back Down life's rugged track ♪ ♪ Wondering if that's What it's all about ♪ ♪ Our family have grown ♪ ♪ And I'll take our music on ♪ ♪ So I guess That's what life's all about ♪ ♪ Our plans were all made ♪ ♪ We sang and played ♪ ♪ The way we were gonna settle in town ♪ ♪ There was freedom out there ♪ ♪ With some hardships to bear ♪ ♪ But no way would we stay back in town ♪ ♪ Now music's being played ♪ ♪ In a much larger scale ♪ ♪ Young voices are proud And singing strong ♪ ♪ So I'm proud to have been ♪ ♪ Just a part of the scene ♪ ♪ So I guess we've written One hell of a song ♪ ♪ Young voices are raised ♪ ♪ They're proud and they're brave ♪ ♪ They'll take our music Out and far beyond ♪ ♪ So Joy said to me ♪ ♪ So proud we should be ♪ ♪ To have written one hell of a song ♪ ♪ Yes, I know we've written One hell of a song ♪ ♪ Yes, I guess we've written One hell of a song ♪ ♪ Bom bom ♪ ♪ Me and Matilda we led a good life ♪ ♪ Done it together as husband and wife ♪ ♪ Bush dances and parties And everyone saw ♪ ♪ Me and Matilda the belle of the ball ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ The rustle of satin The gold in her hair ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ As the orchestra playing The old Irish air ♪ ♪ For me and Matilda the party was over ♪ ♪ When the banker fore-closed And showed us the door ♪ ♪ So we shouldered Our swags and black billy cans ♪ ♪ Went waltzing away With the poor of the land ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ The butcherbirds sang As we went down the track ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ To camp by a billabong Somewhere outback ♪ ♪ You should have seen us Matilda and me ♪ ♪ Dining on damper and black billy tea ♪ ♪ And the squatters God bless 'em They treated us grand ♪ ♪ They fed on us mutton The fat of the land ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ Mutton and damper and black billy tea ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ What more could we want My Matilda and me ♪ ♪ Me and Matilda we parted one day ♪ ♪ I laid to her rest and went on my way ♪ ♪ But never alone for there by my side ♪ ♪ She's waltzing along The ghost of my bride ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me ♪ ♪ Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda ♪ ♪ Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me ♪
