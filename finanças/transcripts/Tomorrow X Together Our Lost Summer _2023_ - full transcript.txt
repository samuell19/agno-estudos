[dramatic music playing] [indistinct chatter] - Up or down? - A small one down. - TXT! - Let's stay together! [all] Tomorrow as well! [Soobin] Let's do it! Seriously, my legs were shaking so much before I went on stage. [inhales sharply] Even thinking about it now, I'm getting butterflies in my stomach. We weren't sure if we should be there. Did we deserve to be there? We... we were worried that we might ruin the vibe. [Beomgyu] It was very different. [chuckling] It was a huge stage. It was the first time I felt nervous - performing in the U.S. - [crowd cheering] [Soobin] Because it was likely that many people there didn't know us. [Hueningkai] We really wanted to do well. [Beomgyu] We couldn't even do a sound check that day. [crowd cheering, whistling] [Yeonjun in English] Are you guys ready?

Going on a tour has always been my dream. I've always wanted to do it. I thought we should have done it earlier. So, when I heard that we were really doing it this time... [breathes deeply] I felt a bit excited. It was our hope that the pandemic would calm down, alleviating the social distancing measures. But things didn't get better, so we only did things online. The idea of only having online events again this year was very discouraging. [Hueningkai] To be honest, for the first concert, which was online... [laughs] It felt a little gloomy. And it also was slightly awkward. So, we were very worried since it would be an actual live event. At the time, I felt like we were finally doing something we should've done a long time ago. So as much as I felt relieved, it was also a little sad as it felt overdue.

We practice for six to seven months, then it's two weeks before performing. I think that's why we lost track of the seasons. When concert tours like this or fan meetings or other opportunities for us to meet MOAs disappear, we have fewer reasons to step outside the studio. So, we don't know when the seasons change. Now we have our seasons back. ["We Lost the Summer" playing] [announcer] Please have your IDs and ticket reservations ready. Then come to the ticket booths to pick up your tickets and bracelets.

You'll be huffing and puffing as you say, "Should we introduce ourselves?" A few seconds left. - Why am I nervous? - Are you guys nervous? - No, not really. - Me neither.

I love you, TXT! [chuckles] [fan 2] I'll scream until I lose my voice at the concert today. [laughs] It had been a while since we saw a packed audience. And the fans were allowed to cheer at the time. So, it was pretty amazing. I think I was really nervous. It was just like our debut showcase. The concert started off the same way. It started with the LED panels opening. So it kind of reminded me of our showcase. It had been a while since we heard only MOAs cheer. So I loved it. - [melodious music concludes] - [audience cheering] [dramatic music playing] [audience cheering continues] [woman] One, two, three, four.

[Taehyun] No matter how many times we tell ourselves to perform like we did in practice, it is difficult to do that. For online concerts, it's possible to perform like we did in practice. But you can't do that for in-person concerts. You use more energy without realizing it. It feels different.

[indistinct chatter] [cameras clicking] [fan] Have a safe trip, Kai! [airplane engine revving] [traffic whizzing] [audience cheering] [Hueningkai] We were very worried. It was the first time we were performing in the U.S. since our debut showcase. So it's been three years. We were worried about whether our MOAs had been waiting for us or not. [Soobin] It was our first concert tour. So, we were very worried and uneasy. To be honest, I wasn't that worried about our performances in the U.S. Even though it was in our debut days, we had done it before. And I remembered that our American fans... knew how to enjoy the show. So, on some level, I expected a warm reaction from them, but it was warmer than I expected, which was exciting. [audience cheering] [crowd cheering] [upbeat music playing] Three years ago, we had our first debut showcase here while filming a reality show. That was our first and last time in New York. We're back after three years. So I'm happy just looking around. I look forward to having a great time here. Let's go!

Especially since I wasn't able to see them during their debut showcase. I'm really excited to see them today. - [in Korean] New York is so energetic. - Everyone is full of character.

I just ran all over the stage, trying to get some cheers. [in English] We all feel the same right now. Just like the title of our debut album. We're really happy to have made our dreams come true.

I did great. - Three years since I've had shaky legs. - It's not because of me. Great job. I finished my first line with confidence. I was about to read the next line, when suddenly...

You have a role in the band, would you say, a specific role, and does that change for each song that you make? [translator in Korean] You each have a role in the band. Does your role change for each song? [in English] And what did you each want to be before you found music? [translator in Korean] What did you want to be before you found music?

Okay, no problem. - Yeah, okay. Beomgyu seems... He may be a little sick. - I think. - [Hueningkai] Oh, yeah, maybe. [staff member] You guys, please clear this path. Clear the aisle.

The company staff and the members were all in a panic. They seemed worried and uneasy about the situation. On the contrary, I was... I think I tried to act normal. [director] We've got one minute.

They embraced and rooted for me, so I felt really grateful. All the pain I had vanished like magic. Actually, even when I get sick, when I'm on stage, the adrenaline rushes in, and I don't even feel it until it's over. [audience chanting, cheering] [in English] Are you all right? - You all right? - Are you okay? Yes. I'm good. [Hueningkai] Let's have a hug before we get started. - Oh! - [audience cheers] [Hueningkai] It's okay. [in Korean] We knew what he had been through. We hugged him to show our appreciation for his efforts. I wanted to tell him that he didn't have to come up on stage. But he made it, and I was so proud of him. [in English] How about you guys? What do you think about this song? I think, it's... - so difficult. - [Taehyun chuckles] - But they want it. - [Beomgyu] What? [Taehyun] But they want it. They want to see your performance. Uh. Today is... - Soobin, Soobin! [chuckles] - [Taehyun laughs] [in Korean] As for me, when I saw Beomgyu, I didn't try to be extra nice or try to comfort him. Instead, I tried to act normal. I think that's what I did. Soobin and others came up to me and asked how I was. They told me I could trust them and to take it easy. They always spoke quietly about such things. I said, "Say that when the camera's around." "Nobody will know about it because there's no one around." "It's okay to be loud about it." "It won't sound fake at all." But they said they just couldn't do it. [Yeonjun] It's a little awkward for us, uh, to show off our caring side in front of the camera. The truth is, we do care about each other, and try our best to be considerate. We also talk to one another a lot. That's how we have built our teamwork. - [crew member] Good job. - [Yeonjun] Beomgyu! We did it! - Was it okay? - [Beomgyu] Yes. I gritted my teeth and toughed it out. Usually, we jokingly say we can't stand each other, but when one of us gets sick, we gather up even though we all have our separate rooms. When times get tough, we're always there for each other. We become a family. I got a lot of energy from them during the tour. [director] How did you form such a relationship? Because we've been together for so long. [laughs] [crew member] I'll deliver whatever you need. Anything other than beer? I want a late-night snack with Soobin. - [Beomgyu groans, laughs] - [laughs] [upbeat music playing] As for me, without Soobin, I could not have made a debut as TXT. [laughs] That's how much Soobin means to me. When I first became a trainee, I was just a beginner while others had more experience. When I didn't know what to do, Soobin was the first to reach out to me. I was happy that Soobin was our leader. I'm happy that he took the role. It's not that I do something special as a leader, but the burden of the title itself is heavier than I thought. [video game sounds] [Yeonjun] He's a perfect leader for our team. He's just the kind of leader we need. [Taehyun] Soobin has his unique kind of power. [Soobin] Through this position, I think I've become a better person. I really believe he is a leader like no other. Soobin, you look good. - Are you taking my picture? - I'm taking your picture. Great. Hey, take a look. It's insane. You must have zoomed in like crazy. - [laughs] - Let me see. - [laughs] - [Taehyun] What is it? - It's better than in real life. [laughs] - [Hueningkai laughs] ["No Rules" playing] We have four more concerts left in three cities. - [camerawoman] One, two, three. Last time. - [camera clicks] Beomgyu trust me and try this. Saltiest food I've ever had. - Is it salty? [laughs] - One, two. [camerawoman] Hold the banners higher. They're casting a shadow. - [audience cheering] - [in English] Hi, Dallas! Hey, guys! [sighs] [in Korean] Who knew I loved Korean food this much? [crowd cheering] We're here. The stage is easy to see. That's good. It'll be fun once people come in. - If this place is packed... - [director] Come, Huening. Okay.

[Soobin] Shall I end him? - [car door closes] - [in English] Let's go! Let's go! [in Korean] I'm on my way to my aunt's house. When I visited America last time, I was nine, and I stayed until I was almost 11. So, for nearly two years. I barely remember. It's been about 12 years. After 12 years, I'm returning to the place where I used to live. This is taking a trip down memory lane. It's a familiar place that I've missed. So I feel a little weird right now. I once made a list called "Yeonjun's Dream Jobs" and shared it with my family. [chuckles] Interestingly, singer was second on the list after painter. [chuckles] I didn't really know much back then. But I just thought singers were cool. I thought, "Maybe I should be a singer." [chuckles] That's why it was my second choice. [clicks tongue] And I became one. [laughs] I'm excited. Oh, what do I do? I'm not emotional now, but I might feel overwhelmed and weird once I arrive. [gasps] It's this place. It's been a while. Oh! - [director] How about walking from here? - Sounds great. [breathes heavily, chuckles] - [director] Do you remember? - It's been ages. Yes. - [crew member] I'll close it. - Is it this way? Hold on. This is the back door. It's changed a lot. This is the back door. [gasps, exclaims] I used to live here. I came here every day. - Everything looked so big back then. - [basketball thudding] - This looks so small now. - [boy 1 exclaims] - [boy 2 in English] What's up? - Hi. Hi. [in Korean] Oh, my God. That's it. [gasps] There it is! That's the house. Gosh, it's changed a lot. It looks completely different. It's been 12 years! [laughs] - [man] Hey! - [grunts, sighs] - [crew member] Nice to meet you. - [man] Thank you. This is my crew. And he's the director. - [man] I see. - Hi. - [girl] Hey. - [chuckles] [chuckles] - It's amazing. This part hasn't changed. - [girl laughs] - [woman] Gosh, you must be tired. - [Yeonjun] I'm fine.

[chuckles] Wow. - This is crazy. [gasps] - [woman] This takes you back, right? - [Yeonjun] It sure does. - [man] Thanks again. [upbeat music playing] [interviewer] Who do you think can make a debut? A sincere one. A person... who is sincerely committed to it, be it singing or dancing. [interviewer] So do you think you can make it? Yes, I think I can. [Soobin] I didn't expect it to be this cold. It's probably the same in L.A. too. L.A. might be warmer. It's very close to here. [director] This is backstage, guys. - [Yeonjun] I see. - [Hueningkai] Is it here? [director] Yes, this space. - [crew member] It's pretty long. - [director] It is. [Hueningkai] Oh, is it? But... [director] It's quite long. - But there'll be an audience here. - Really? - [director] Be careful. - [crew member] It's 5,500 people. [staff member] It's not about one specific song. You mean the entire performance. I can see minor mistakes in each song. As to our new song Eternally, it's these dance moves and other detailed moves we synchronized before. - Like catching each other... - [Yeonjun] Yes. They're not quite as they should be. - Your moves are somewhat vague. - [Soobin] Right. [staff member] Please keep that in mind. - Sure. - Noted.

All right! The "blue-haired guy" is back! We perform 11 songs nonstop in the middle. That part is the most challenging and physically exhausting. There's no break between songs. Even when a video clip is on for a brief moment, we need to go and change. So, we basically don't have time to rest. Naturally, it's physically draining. It was tough for all of us. I have sweat in my ears... [Beomgyu] When we sing Opening Sequence, we talk to each other using our in-ear monitors. MOAs can't hear us, but we can hear it through our in-ears.

I put the mic belt here. [staff member] Other than that, everyone did a great job. But during MOA Diary, Soobin skipped a move. - The sign? - No one did it today. - But... - [Taehyun] I did the move. - [staff member] The rest of you did. - We did. After this move, I felt like doing it sitting down, so I did. [staff member] While on stage today, did anyone think that a certain part needed more practice? Soobin has been having trouble with Wishlist. [staff member] That's right. [Soobin] During the concert tour... I felt something that I had never felt before. As we repeat the same concert with the same set list, I got distracted without realizing it and made a mistake.

[Beomgyu] Huening is such a professional. A nosebleed didn't stop him from performing three songs. He just wiped the blood off and carried on. He was awesome. I was fine. It didn't really hurt. Honestly, I didn't get a nosebleed because I got hurt. It was because I danced too hard, so you don't need to worry. There's only one person who can nail the intro of Frost. I really think he's the only one. Not just out of the five of us. He's the only one in the world. It starts off with a laugh. You'd have to be pretty wacky to pull it off. - And he does it so perfectly. - [band members cheer] Hueningkai is a perfect fit for these songs. - [Beomgyu] Hey, Huening. - [upbeat music playing] There's this rule I live by. I need to sleep at least four and a half hours a day. I should go to the gym. I started because of the tour. I wanted to get more fit. So I started working out.

I really loved everything about it. We wanted to interact with fans who were seated far away. So, we suggested going out into the audience. We wanted to give each and every one of them a chance to greet us. [Hueningkai] We were giving high fives to everyone. We were so pleased to see them enjoying it. [Beomgyu] We wanted to be closer to them. We weren't just performing by ourselves. We were all doing it together. That's the message we wanted to send out. We made eye contact with every single fan. We could tell everyone was so happy to see us. Every single one of them. [Soobin] The relationship between idols and fans is really special and amazing.

I really think you can't be a singer without holding a concert. You hear all those people cheering for you. And that's when you really feel like a singer. Yeah, we're evolving. - [music concluding] - [crowd applauding] [crew member 1] Nice work. [crew member 2] Great job, everyone! - Good job! - [crew members cheering] [Soobin] Wow!

It was our last day, but luckily, we were all in good shape. We really enjoyed our time together with MOAs. I'm so glad. Whoa! How did I do this? I'd like to ask my past self. [chuckles] - We actually did this. We finished it. - [director] I know. Honestly, I first thought that this tour was undoable. - But we did it. - [Hueningkai] It's far from over. Anyway, you were all great! It was the best. Now, all we have left is the big one. [staff member] We have to talk about Frost. You were all crazy, in a good way. He said himself that he'll show us what crazy is. He really did it with that nosebleed. - [staff member] That nosebleed was epic. - [chuckles] Of course.

Let's start with our leader. - He has something to tell us. - Don't do this. - Please stop. - He has something to say. I can guarantee that all of you will be jeering at me after I'm done. Just for today, we'll cheer you on. - Okay. - My fellow members... [chuckles] thank you all for working so hard and not getting hurt in the past three weeks. Good job! Great work! What did you like most during our stay in the U.S.? You know what they say. That idols come back with better skills after they finish a tour. - I mean, really... - I know what you mean. It's not just dancing and singing skills, but your stage presence also grows. And when it comes to interacting with the audience, you feel more relaxed. - We had a strong finish today. - We certainly did. Let's do the same at Lollapalooza. - Got it. - Strong finish at Loll. I'm going to have somaek.

I'm fine. [grunts] [mellow music playing] Up until now, the other members, some of the staff, and I spent time... eating and drinking together. We shared some meaningful conversations. And now I'm back in my room. I have to say that I really don't feel like sleeping tonight. I plan to spend some time alone watching a movie. Before I do that, since I haven't washed up yet, I need to take a shower first. It's really late right now. I always end my day with a shower. When I shower, I try to review what I did that day and organize my thoughts. That's what I usually do. But since today's concert was the last one of our U.S. tour, it took me longer to shower with so many thoughts in my head. It really is kind of late. But I'm still going to watch a movie. Oh, boy! [engine revving over TV] Oh, no! I fell asleep. I fell asleep while watching the movie. [grunts] [in English] This year's Lollapalooza is underway at Grant Park. [newscaster 1] Gates opened about an hour ago. Fans are ready to get right by the stage. [in Korean] On the main stage at Lollapalooza, a major outdoor music festival, the leading group of fourth-gen K-pop... [newscaster 2] TXT is set to perform at a concert. - There's an upcoming concert. - That's right. The big one's left. - I'm already a little worried. - Me too. I'm a bit worried too. I'm sure there'll be people who aren't familiar with K-pop. We'll be performing on stage and they'll say... [in English] "Oh, who's that?" [in Korean] Please come see us at Lollapalooza. [all laugh] - Please come and make some noise. - Please, I'm so scared! What if we go on stage and it's all quiet? - [laughs] - I'm scared. - [director] He wants more practice. - I do. It's such a big set and we're pressed for time. [staff member] We should rehearse it then. [Taehyun] And work on the weak spots. That's a good attitude. - Yeah, that's great. - Let's rehearse first. [Taehyun] We don't often hear that from Beomgyu. [staff member] I think I'm going to cry. First time in three years. [Taehyun] The day we've been waiting for is finally here. But I'm not that nervous. I think I've gained a lot of confidence during my stay here. All my worries about Lollapalooza before going on this U.S. tour have disappeared. I think it's because of all the practice and just the tour itself here in the U.S. [lively music playing] [lively music concludes] [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] In the first verse, at "Stuck in my heart, widened," we'll come in wide. [Beomgyu] We'll set it to one. - [crew member] That's fine. - [Beomgyu] Okay. [staff member] Remember that four and eight will open wider. Yes. [Taehyun] Except for the center position, the other members have to figure out where to stand in the middle. - [in English] Yeah. - [Jimin in English] Yeah. [in Korean] You should eat up. Where are the TXT members? - [crew member 1] Next room. - Should we go? - Let's go say hi. - [Jimin] What? [j-hope laughing] - [Jimin] Hi. - [Beomgyu] Hello! - [Jimin] Good luck! - Thank you. Where will you be watching? - [Jimin] I'm not sure. - I heard you'll be at the back. [Jimin] We don't really know. We'll just watch from there. - [Jimin] With the rest of the audience. - Really? [Jimin] We don't know this place that well. Me neither. - Are you guys ready? - Uh... - We did our best to prepare but... - [Jimin] You'll do great. I'm getting really nervous. [Jimin] You shouldn't be. You'll do fine. - You got this. - Thank you. - Thank you. - [j-hope] We'll enjoy it. [Beomgyu] Why am I nervous? [man in English] Are you ready? - Let's go. Let's go, guys. - Hey! [indistinct chatter] - Let's go! Let's go! - [all cheer] - [in Korean] Did you do a rehearsal? - We just checked our positions. - What about a sound check? - We couldn't do it.

Even thinking about it now, - I'm getting butterflies in my stomach. - [crowd cheering] [Yeonjun] We weren't sure if we should be there. Did we deserve to be there? We... we were worried that we might ruin the vibe. [Beomgyu] It was very different. It was a huge stage. [Soobin] Because it was likely that many people there didn't know us. [Taehyun] It was right before we went on stage. It was the first time I felt nervous performing in the U.S. [Hueningkai] We really wanted to do well.

Even though we were outdoors, we could hear the MOAs' excitement even from the stage. It was so exhilarating. We literally went all out. [Yeonjun] The front row was filled with MOAs. Even the non-MOA fans in the back were all enjoying it together, waving their hands. [Beomgyu] Honestly, I was really worried. I'm always happy with an audience packed with MOAs. But I get more excited in front of other fans. It's just a different feeling. Since MOAs are already our fans, I just have to work harder to keep their love and support.

Why am I so tired? I haven't sweated this much in a long time. It was really hot, and I guess I was too excited. I was excited from the start. I thought I was toning it down. It was a great concert. It really was a memorable event. Thanks for giving us such great memories, MOAs. It was my first performance where I went all out. It's not that I'm exhausted and tired because I went all out. It's a strange mix of feelings. A little bit of pride, and a feeling of overwhelming emotion. As soon as it was over, all these emotions rushed in. That's when I felt it. I was glad I became a singer. I always say that the reason I'm a singer is because of MOAs. I'm sure it's very similar to what most artists repeatedly tell their fans. But on that stage, I realized, "This is it." "This is exactly why I'm a singer." I just kept thinking that over and over. [Taehyun] It was a performance that gave me so much confidence. Whenever I prepare for other performances, I'll think back to that moment. [crew member 1] We should get going. [crew member 2] Good job. That was an awesome performance. [Soobin] Thank you. [chuckles] You know, after Lollapalooza, I cried so hard in my hotel room. All the other members were saying it was their happiest day since their debut as singers. But... I didn't feel the same. [chuckles] Well... When there are no dance moves, and I'm supposed to just let go, I can't seem to enjoy myself, and I feel like I'm moving in an awkward way. [clicks tongue] Um... I'm a singer because I want to perform and earn love and support from the fans. But when I wasn't getting that... I really felt isolated. - [in English] Goodbye. - [woman] Goodbye. Thank you. [Hueningkai] Thank you, guys! [sentimental music playing] [in Korean] Sit. [Soobin] I want to be able to hold on... to all my fans... so they won't leave me. Even though I couldn't enjoy all my performances, I always gave my best because... I wanted to repay the fans for their love and express my love for them as well. That's why I worked so hard.
