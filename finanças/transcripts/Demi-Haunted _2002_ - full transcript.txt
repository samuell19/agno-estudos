You're stepping on my hand! Sorry. - What's up? - Are you OK? I'm sorry. Bak, Hung is waiting for you to rehearse. - Sorry. - Let's go. Everybody's here except you. Go on. Quick - OK. - "I, the King, must defend the state" "I won't return" "Until I kill Liu Bang" "Give me my horse and spear..." - Jean, are you all right? - I'm fine. "Horse and spear..." Here... What is this? A "toothpick" spear? Is the "toothpick" spear what I use? Mine is the "conqueror" spear! Go get it! Going now... You hid the spear. I'll give it to him when the show starts. - Give it back to me. - No! - You can have it then. - Are you sure? I'm kidding. Get out. - Your mum's going to scold you. - Geez! What a nuisance. Stop it. Miko, cut it out. Is that you, Dong Dong? Dong Dong? Oh, my beauty! A little louder. Oh, my beauty! Louder still. Oh... my beauty! Is that clear now? - That will do. - You... - Hung, your salary. - OK. That rascal, Bak, still hasn't brought me my "conqueror" spear. - That's right. - It's been half an hour. Where did he end up loafing? Hung, calm down. I'll find him. What did you eat last night? Sorry. Go away... Go get changed first. Hurry... Jean. Remember, follow Kwan. You're the fourth to go on stage. Hurry up... - Got it. - Bring some more in. - Jean... - What's up? I can't find Bak. What should we do now? Oh dear! The show is going to start soon. Relax, he'll show up in time. - I'll go look again. - Tell me what to do. Your dad went to Shenzhen all of a sudden. Bak does the best somersaults in the troupe. What should I do now? Here's my suggestion. Get Little Yankee to replace him. Little Yankee...? Yes! Show our troupe manager a couple of somersaults. - But he's a Westerner. - What's the problem? The Hegemon-King of Western Chu hailed from the West too. All right, Hung. Whatever you say. Get changed! Get changed. It's from one of my fans. "Smiling Beauty". I saved them especially for you. Darn... What is this? The show has started! "My beauty, your swordplay" "Never fails to ease my pain" - City Hall, please. - OK. - I'm in a hurry. - No problem. - What happened? - A ghost...! Leave me alone! "Oh, my beauty..." "Backstage. No Entry" "Give me my horse and spear..." "Bring it to me now" Coming! "Though I'm heartbroken" "I yearn to see you" "But you're nowhere in sight" Yin, what's happening? "Father chose a husband for me" "And I was compelled to marry someone "Whom I don't love" "What has kept you away" Bring the curtain down...! It's my turn... Bring the curtain down! What are you doing? I want to see if I can capture the image of a ghost. How does it feel to be possessed? Tell me. I think I saw a red lantern. I'd better offer them incense. I also heard, vaguely, the song "Rendezvous at the Terrace". I heard it in my dreams too. Man, I'm jealous. I've never had a supernatural encounter before. Fire him! You're the jinx! Are you the troupe manager? Jean! You made a fool of yourself, why blame me? You were late; that's unprofessional. But he made it just in time. He made funny faces when he came on stage. You're tarnishing my reputation! I'll call my husband and check with him, OK? If you don't fire him, I'll quit! OK... I'll fire him! "As soon as you set sail" "We're in..." "Two different worlds" "The birds are flying south" "Flying back home" "When are they coming back" "I'm wretched..." Auntie Lego. You're back? You sing well when nobody is around. You become a mute when someone listens. Don't hide your light under a bushel. Stop nagging at me. I saw a ghost and was fired today. - All right, that's enough. - Yes, enough. Let's talk again tomorrow. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Keep your eyes peeled. Two trays of soda went missing last night. Don't doze off. You hear me? Yes... good night. Auntie Lego, you forgot your money. - My money? - Over there. Be good now. - I'll get going. - Keep the money properly. Remember to lock up. You hear me? Yes, I'll take care of it. It's done. Take your hands off. - I'm leaving. - OK. Be careful. Remember to lock up. When did I get this piece of jade? That's so funny! You're so lame! Food is here! Food is ready. Get up. "Butterflies fluttering about..." - Bak...? - Yes? I've checked it online. Listen. The ghost carries a red lantern because opera divas used to live on boats. When they went ashore to perform at night, they'd take a red lantern with them to light up the path. What about "Rendezvous at the Terrace"? "Sleeping together for three years"? It sounds like something erotic. Nonsense! It isn't! Zhu Yingtai was a girl. She went to school, disguised as a boy and was forced to share a bed with Liang Shanbo. Love blossomed between them. Unfortunately, Liang was too stupid to see through Zhu's disguise. By the time he did, Zhu had to marry another man. - And then? - A sad ending for those two. They should've been more straightforward with each other. Let's get back to my problem. The ghost's harassing me and got me fired. What should I do now? Go back to the theatre and talk to her. Probably she just wants some offerings. She's right. Don't be afraid. Look at you. You're scared out of your wits. You must've slept with the ghost last night. You're down in luck, that's why you got entangled with the spirits. Why mess around with spirits? Let Master Hip Hop read your fortune. You're going to be dogged by misfortune. Shut up! Be fearless, dude. She's scary. How scary? I'm not going. We're right behind you! He can help you. OK... I need to get something to protect myself. - The urine of a virgin boy. - Let's go! What do you want? HK$100! Deal! Pay up. - Hurry... - Turn around. Don't peek. Watch my bike! - Have you finished? - Not yet. I can't pee. Another HK$50 should do it. "Oh, my beauty..." Let's count to three and open the door. Don't go! Ready? One, two, three! Pardon my ignorance. Please don't be mad at me. Are you looking for me? Hung, why are you here? Did you see the ghost too? Yes, I-I was harassed by the ghost... - You were raped. - Yes... My lips are sealed. Rest assured. Tell Jean I'll come back to work tomorrow. You may find this useful. Take it. It can drive the spirits away. Thanks. I'm a little thirsty. You can't drink it! It's urine! One, two, three, four... If that schmuck dares tell a soul, I'll put him in a sack and beat him to a pulp. Don't worry, he didn't see you. I told him the ghost raped me and he believed me! I'm afraid my husband will find out about us. Good. We'll tell him straight in the face. Don't even think about it. I'm serious about you. You're such a creep. I know... Miko. - You missed it. - What? I really saw a ghost last night. Is that so? Congratulations. And I witnessed something even worse. - What's that? - Hey, you... Nothing... Let's have some fun. Come with me. - Hung... - What's up? We need to talk. It's important. I'm busy. Let's talk later. - It's very important! - It's very important! What is it? We're wondering if you can show us a couple of somersaults. Why do I have to do that? You know better. Sure! Since you're so diligent and keen to learn today, I'll show you the tricks of the trade. Great. Make way... I knew you'd kick me on purpose. Miko. Lin, can you get me a hat later? Thanks. Where did you put it? I think it's in the dressing room. - OK, I'll get it for you. - Thanks. Fong? Did you see Miko? Fong, you're not supposed to wear this piece of costume. Fong? Don't follow me. Are you crazy! Leave me alone! Don't force me. Leave me alone. Don't force me. Worthless scum! Why are tough guys like you ganging up against a poor girl? Aren't you ashamed? It's none of your business. You fought well but why did you beat them up? Miss, you were being bullied. I was just trying to help... - What are you doing? - What do you think? Taking advantage of me? "What kept you so long" "I'm confused" "And I fear our love..." "Is in shambles" "Liang." "Zhu, my brother..." "I'm glad that you're an honourable man" "I'm ready to fall in love with you" "Let's sing a love song" "Together we form..." "Let's sing a love song" "Together we form..." "Let's sing a love song" "Together we form..." "Let's sing a love song" "Together we form..." Please help me finish the song. Why me? Because I'm your previous life. I can't do it! You can. I can't... Who thrashed you like this? - What's with you? - Being possessed again? Stop making fun of me, will you? I've had enough from the ghost. Why are you so frightened? She made me sing "Rendezvous at the Terrace". "Rendezvous at the Terrace"? Great! She even made me play the female role. I don't know what to do next. I do. If you see that ghost again, take off your undies and cover her head with it. - Will it work? - Never heard of that before. Is she a woman? - Yes... - It works on women. Bak. - Jean. - Take this. You'll take the lead role this time. We're going to stage a new show. The client has specifically asked for you to perform "Rendezvous at the Terrace" and play the female role. Great! You should be happy for Bak. I'm not going to do it. I... What's the matter? It's your big break. You can't be doing somersaults in the troupe all your life, can you? I'm happy to do that. - I'm not... - Listen to me. You look awfully cute playing the role of a woman. Who the hell wanted that schmuck to play the lead? I don't know. My husband made the deal while he was in China. Now that you mention it, it feels rather creepy. At your last ghostly encounter, you were singing "Rendezvous at the Terrace" too. Don't stage the show then. Do you think I've a choice? We've only staged four or five shows so far. The troupe depends on us for a living. What are you doing? I've got to attend to my guests now. Let's talk later. No way! Your guys wounded my friend. I can't sit back and do nothing. What do you want then? Look! They smashed his head with a bottle. Who did it? It was him! I thought... Are you satisfied now? No! I need compensation for his medical bills. - How much? - HK$100,000. That's too much. HK$1,000 is enough. Say so earlier, sweetie. This is nothing compared to what I lost in one game. Let's go. Take off your clothes! This is for you. You're such a shark. Do you always squeeze money out of your dad like this? He owns a casino; it's ill-gotten money anyway. It's not a big deal. Why don't you keep me company tonight? It's nearly dawn. - Why don't you let me... - Come with me. OK! - Is this your home? - No. I come here whenever I'm depressed. I'll feel better right away. But I still need someone to comfort and sweet-talk me. Can you do it? I'm afraid you may not be strong enough. Don't worry; I can do it. This guy is quite cute. Miss, you should be more ladylike. Auntie Sei, where do you keep the herbs? Over there. Let me have a look. What are these that cost HK$100,000? It's good for curing rheumatism. It's called extra-terrestrial herbal vine. Smugglers risk their lives to bring them out. It's said that it grows on fallen asteroids. Extra-terrestrial herbal vine... Auntie Sei. Here's HK$100,000. Why don't you sell them all to me? Dad's rheumatism is acting up again lately. What are you doing? Come and help move it. Auntie Sei, what's that noise? It's the washing machine. - I'll fix it for you. - OK. Young man, you're a lucky guy. Our missy is a nice girl. You don't believe? I brought her up since she was a kid. She's a good girl. - What's this? - Look here. She scored good grades in school. Really? Her name is Loke Wan Choi! (lottery) Her dad won lottery on the day she was born. The washing machine is fixed... what are you laughing at? What happened to you? You don't look very good. Did something happen to you lately? He always seems distracted. What... A ghost's been harassing me. She even said she was my previous life. This is the thing for you, an exorcism chip. I bought it for HK$1,000 from an Indian. HK$1,000? He said it can strengthen brain waves. It can keep all kinds of spirits away. HK$1,000, please. What? He needs it since he's so timid; all the spirits will bully him easily. I dare you to repeat it. He needs it since he's so timid; all the spirits will bully him easily. Hello. Are you daring me? I'm going for sure. Miko? Look at how frightened you are. I was here the last time after the ghost locked me inside the trunk. Who wouldn't be scared? Don't kid me! You have every reason to be scared. Sixty years ago, a show was staged here and the female lead... It was "Rendezvous at the Terrace"? Yes, that's right. There are opera shows staged here every year but no one dares sing "Rendezvous at the Terrace". You're the only one who dares sing it. - I didn't promise anything. - I'd checked with the Association of Cantonese Opera. The dead female lead was called Ji Wan Fay. I even know where she's buried. Let's go... Wait a minute. I think we'd better talk to her or she'll keep on harassing you. I'll help you. OK? Ji Wan Fay! Ji Wan Fay, I... I'm not afraid of you. Come on out! How did you get to see her the last time? I saw her when I passed out. You saw her when you passed out? Come out. Let's count to three and smack it on our heads. - OK. - One, two, three. I meant smacking each another's head, not your own! Darn... Wake up! Wake up! You wanted to see me. Why are you so scared? Look at yourself. Who wouldn't be scared? Can't you look a little more normal? Are you gay? What do you mean? Let me tell you. Sixty years ago, I was the male lead who melted the hearts of thousands of women! "I conquered the land" "With bravery and courage" "What can women like you do" "Women have always surpassed men" "You've enraged me" "I'm going to take you down with my spear" "Watch out" But she's a woman! Awesome, isn't it? You aren't nearly as popular with the girls as I was. I'm not boasting. - This way. - Come out! - Here. - You're so lousy. There you are. I'm here. Come over here. You're mine. Don't move! Don't run. There you are. You're Keng Fah? No, Mr Cheong. Guess who I am? You're Sui Yit! Master, he's a man! Mr Cheong, this is Ji Wan Fay. She's a woman. Do you know a lot of women prefer you to real men? My name is Cheong Ho Fung. Nice to meet you. I'm only an actress. I'm just a gambler. Our theatre has just signed a six-month contract with Ji Wan Fay. That's how we got the honour to invite her here. Thank you for your kindness. - Come, play with us. - Yes... - Let's start! - We're here... Wake up... You're so naughty... Wake up, you little brat! Go freshen up and get to work! When did I come back? Last night you came back in a stupor. It was Miko who helped you back. Come on, hurry up! Sorry! It's you again? Why are you standing up to pee? You're a female ghost! Why? I play the role in reality too. Will you stop following me like a ghost? But I'm a ghost. Let's get down to business. Will you perform the show for me? Is that why you're refusing to go? Of course. We're both actors, so you should understand that we can't rest in peace until we finish the performance. Why didn't you get someone else to do it all these years? I tried. Unfortunately, before you were born, my spirit was reincarnated as a chicken. Then, an Italian in the second reincarnation. And the third reincarnation is me and my answer is no. Then I'll scare you out of your wits! You look scary enough now. I'm so scared... What took you so long? What are you doing? What on earth is happening? You... Which one is yours? What are you doing? You... What are you doing? Let me add some water for you. You're nuts! What's the din about? What's wrong with you? What a mess! I asked you to help but look at yourself now! Can you come to your senses? - Be careful! - What are you doing? You've dropped all my money! Rascal, you're nothing but trouble! Bak, what are you doing? Are you going to perform or not? Idiot! We must go save him. - How? - Come with me. Bloody woman! Are you trying to bribe me? So long you agree to perform the show, all these is yours to spend. Is this hell money? You wouldn't have so much money, would you? All right, let's make a deal. I'll do whatever you ask. What are you doing? It's none of your business! You're not wearing a bra? Scumbag! Don't touch me! There are bandages here. Are you hurt? That's bosom-wrapping cloth. Bosom-wrapping cloth? I don't see why you need it to begin with. I play male roles. Of course, I have to. If not, how would I look like a man? You still have to keep up a pretence as a ghost. How sad. I see! You must be flat-chested. That's why you're using that as an excuse. Flat-chested? I'm not that bad. I don't believe you. You don't? Mock me, eh? Fine! It's not bad indeed. Didn't I tell you so? It's good to be yourself. Don't you dare belittle me again. I won't... It feels great to be yourself, isn't it? What are you doing? Nothing. That's just my style. I do that when I feel good... Relax... Don't twist your butt. Just relax. Relax! It feels good. Be yourself. Don't care what others think. Let's just be ourselves... Take off the tie and relax... - Relax... - Relax... Relax! - Like this? - Be yourself, relax. What else do you want to do? I want you to wrap up the show! I'm serious. If you promise to do that, I'll do anything for you. Anything? I want... Loke Wan Choi. Spice Girl? She's flat-chested. I'm much better... It's none of your business! So, the bottom line is a girl? OK! I'll help you. Lo Chor Bak! Chor Bak! Is this for real? It's just coincidence. What an interesting place. Yes... Can I stay for a while? You're welcome to. I didn't expect you to find your way here. Exactly. My dad gambled away a lot of money yesterday. He wants me to help him out. How? To take care of his clients, most of them are pigs. Some of them are women. It's pretty tough on you. I'd be drenched with perspiration and would throw up every time. So... Do you earn a lot... every time you do it? Why do you throw up and perspire so much? Have you asked enough? Where's your bed? Let's sleep together? I'm just kidding. Have a good rest. As long as I'm here, I assure you no one will bother you. Can I go to bed now? Let me tidy up the bed for you. Tidy up your face first! You've been flung out... You made a fool of me! Do as your heart desires so you'll be a happy man. Ms Wan Fay... Mr Cheong is waiting for you to enact the spears play. "I conquered the land" "With bravery and courage" "I conquered the land" "With bravery and courage" "What can women like you do" "Women have always surpassed men" "You've enraged me" "I'm going to take you down with my spear" Siu Hoi, go buy us supper. Let's continue. Scumbag! I told you to kiss, not touch! I can't help it! Oh, kiss? It's here. Move it out. I don't think it's a good idea. Saving Bak is the crux of the matter. You promised to help me but all you did was get in the way! Blame yourself for being lewd. I'm not doing it! I'm not doing the show! How can you go back on your words? I was just kidding, can't I? You're not trustworthy at all! So what? Lo Chor Bak! Yes, my uncle gave me that name! I beg you. Please wrap up the show for me. Fine. If you drink this up. OK. Come on, drink it up and I'll help you. OK! Rest assured I'll keep my promise; I was just kidding you. What happened? Turn it around. Somebody is messing me up. What's happening? Turn it this way. Be serious, will you? Watch out... One, two, three. I can't stop... help! We're not here for a BBQ today. - Quick, put the urn on the fire. - Make way. I haven't eaten anything yet. Where's the "Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"? Are you roasting bones? Did you smell... something funny? Something is burning? Yes, you're burning. Here it comes again. Why does my head keep swinging? - Bak, where are you? - I don't know. I can't stop... - I'm exhausted... - My phone is ringing. - Hello? - How? Has the ghost collapsed? What the hell are you doing? Messing with the ghost. Stop it! It's affecting me too. Bring it down... quick...! - What happened? - Just do it, don't ask! It's very hot! After being roasted by your friends... I can't go on for very long. So, I don't have to sing for you anymore? Don't even think about it. We've to do it quickly. Time is running out. I'll make it clear. I've never been a female lead before. Don't worry. You'll be possessed by me and I'll sing on your behalf. Since this is your first time playing the female role, why don't you use my name, Ji Wan Fay? I'm sure you can do it. "Choi Tin Seng Opera Troupe" "Female Lead - Ji Wan Fay" "Reserved" May I test the microphone for the ghost? "I'm glad that you're an honourable man" "I'm ready to fall in love with you" I can hear it... the ghost is singing... Sorry! Forgive us! Sorry, please don't blame us... Sorry! She's gone. What are you doing? Go out and watch the show. Get out... stop fooling around. Bak, make sure you learn the melody and lyrics well. This is a very famous piece. Don't make a fool of yourself. Do you get it? He can't even remember his own telephone number. I bet he's going to make a fool of himself. - Sub Zai. - Yes, Master Hung? - Here's a longan for you. - Thanks. Do you know how an idiot who can't even somersault properly ends up playing the lead? Keep practising. Practise my foot! He was possessed! Being possessed like this... That's how he ended up playing the female lead role. He's nothing but a cheat. Oh yes, talk about yourself. Keeping up a pretence to deceive the housewives to come watch the shows. Oh! My beauty... My beauty... You're neither good at singing, acting, reading nor martial arts. How dare you! You were still a kid when I started performing on stage. How dare you criticise me? Calm down. He's only a kid. A kid? He's old enough to have a kid! - Darn kid! - Cool it. Go have some tea. He's too much! How dare he say that I can't act in front of a crowd! What's the use of practising? It won't be me who's going to sing. Can you be a little more diligent? Or you'll regret it when you're dead like me. Is Chor Bak performing here tonight? Yes... he's over there. He sings very well. That's Lo Chor Bak. His stage name is Ji Wan Fay. He's superb. This amazing. You look great. Do I? Are you running away from your dad again? Why are you tearing it down? What are you doing? Jean, you've your problem and I've mine. Your show is starting very soon but we haven't been paid a single cent. We need to make a living. It's my husband who usually takes care of setting up the stage. I haven't seen him for a month. I don't care. If you don't pay up today, - I'll tear down the stage! - Wait a minute. - How much do we owe him? - HK$150,000. Pay up in full! "Can you please give us some more time" He's nuts! Go ahead! Tear it down! Please don't...! Shut up! Have anyone seen my daughter, Loke Wan Choi? Taking advantage of me? Choi... Choi! A bunch of idiots! Tear it down! Please don't...! Chiu, will you give us a few more days on account of our long collaboration? I'll give you one day. I'll be back to collect the money tomorrow. If you can't pay up by then, you can forget about staging the show. - Let's go. - We'll take a break tonight. What should we do now? What can we do? Go rob someone! We'd go to jail for that. You'll be jailed, not me. How can you be so inhuman? I'm not human; I'm a ghost! You're worse than humans. If you don't help me, I'll be in deep trouble. Please, I beg you. Bak, how much money do you need? HK$150,000. I want HK$150,000. - That's a real friend. - Deal! But I want him to go with me. Do it! Take him with us! I'm dressed up as a woman. I'm not a woman. What are you doing? Bear with it. It's just superficial pain. At least, you don't have to go to jail. Let's not waste time. What's the bet? - A house? - OK. - What if you lose? - Take me. Excellent! Let's play mahjong. A ready hand. I win. One more round! Heavenly Hand. One more round! Heavenly Hand again. - You're a cheat! - Don't be a sore loser. Who are you to speak? I'm the Gambler of Foshan. I'd checked my luck today. Consulting various divination methods... No one told you my daughter's been winning money the day she was born? She hasn't lost a single bet. I don't believe it! Let's play cards! Straight flush. Dominoes! Supreme Pair. Let's play a guessing game! Go after her. Are you OK? Why did you come after me? I'd like to thank you. Why did you throw up like that? I throw up every time after gambling. I'm born with it. No wonder you hate socialising with your dad's friends. I thought you were being forced to be a hooker. Why do you care so much about me? Do girls like to chitchat in toilets? Kiss me. Didn't you say you love me? I don't feel like it now. Let's go. Look. We're not compatible at all. How did it go? He drove me nuts! Yes, indeed... If that schmuck dares play any tricks again, I'll get someone to beat him up. Yes, he deserves it! He has gone too far. Come, sit... get a drink first. Hung is a Cantonese opera star. Who hasn't heard of Hegemon-King of Western Chu? Yes... When I celebrated my mum's 60th birthday last year, I was honoured to have you performed for her. - You were superb. - Thank you... I heard someone is giving you a hard time. A schmuck is trying to be funny with him. Let's not talk about it. I'll tell you what happened. I'm an easy-going person. I get along with everyone. I even say thank you to the tea lady. If the youngsters come to consult me, I'll tell them all I know. I don't put on airs. But that schmuck openly accused me of not knowing how to act. How can I swallow that? Neither can I! You're the doyen. Listen to me... He was still sucking his pacifier when I started acting. Calm down. I'll teach him a lesson. Don't trouble yourself. No problem. You performed gratis at my mum's birthday party. I owed you one. That's not very nice, I think. Am I going to be indebted to you for life? That's not what I meant. It's very simple. Tell me the schmuck's name and where I can find him. I'll take care of the rest. His name is Chor Bak. He works in Hung's opera troupe. You've my word. All will be taken care of. Don't worry. Bye. Let's go. I've been waiting for over 60 years and yet the debut is going to be delayed. All is settled now. We'll make up for it tomorrow. But no women seem to like me. Having you as my present life is my retribution. You're a woman. Can you help me understand myself better? I could've kissed Wan Choi just now, but I failed. I'm very experienced in this area; I can help you. I can't do it! I can't. Cheong Ho Fung? Grasshopper! - Catch it for me! - Why? Don't ask, just catch it! - Get on the stage! - OK! Go, Little Bo. I've lost all my fortune. Go find a better master. Bye. Mr Cheong, this isn't enough to pay off your debts. But it's all I have. You can take my life if you want. What's your life worth to me? You have so many women. They can help pay off your debts. I'll hold myself responsible for what I did. Don't you dare touch them! Please don't! Don't hurt Mr Cheong! How much does he owe you? Let's play one round. Let him go! I want his women. Who the hell are you? I'm Ji Wan Fay. If I lose, you can do anything you like to me. - Ji Wan Fay? Great! - Wan Fay... I like your style! Is this worth it? Yes! I'll go for "big"! "Big"? No. - "Small." - "Small"? "Small"! Are you sure? "Small"! Wan Fay! What is it? How can I ever repay you? How about betrothing yourself to me? It's only natural to help a friend in need. But you risked your own life just now. You really want me to betroth myself to you? Don't think so highly of yourself! This is the third time. It's the same divine revelation. I'm not lying to you. Not a chance? If you're asking about your career, that's a different story. If it's about your love life, you'll have to wait till your next life. I refuse to believe in destiny. You like Ji Wan Fay? Sometimes I treat her like a man but at times I think she's a... I'm confused. She's only an actress. I owed her a favour. Wan Fay. I'll perform "Rendezvous at the Terrace" the night after tomorrow. I'll be playing the female lead this time. The fans like you in your male role. Ruin your own career for all I care but please don't ruin my business here. I'll only perform this once. You must come. I will. Manager, the board doesn't fit. I can't hang it properly. It's just for one night. It should be able to hold. I guess so. "Female Lead - Ji Wan Fay" "Compliments from Cheong Ho Fung" Wan Fay, his congratulatory plaque arrived. Where is he? Wan Fay, it's time for the show to start. Wait for a while more. We can start now. Are you Wan Fay? Are you the Ji Wan Fay who performed "Rendezvous at the Terrace"? Who are you? The plaque is a token from me. Are you Cheong Ho Fung? - I... - Mr Cheong? Can we meet up? What should I do? Dress up before you go. I'll burn two sexy dresses for you. I bet he'll be thrilled. It's fate if you can get to meet him again after so many years. If you mess this up, you can forget about coming back to me. I won't help you. We're here to look for Mr Cheong? Come on in. You're... I'm Lo Chor Bak. My stage name is Ji Wan Fay. Wan Fay? What a coincidence. Please pardon me for sending you the congratulatory plague abruptly. Are you Cheong Ho Fung? It's been 60 years. Mr Cheong... Possess him, quick. Be in unison with his human body. I'll leave you guys alone. Take your time. I'm a man. Handle this yourself, will you? "I conquered the land" "With bravery and courage" "What can a woman" "Like you do" "Women have always surpassed men" "You enraged me" "I'll take you down with my spear" "Watch out" You've improved a lot. It goes without saying. I've been practising on my own for 60 years. I've had enough, please let go of me. Mr Cheong. Mr Cheong. Mr Cheong. Mr Cheong. Hey! Help me! What are you doing? Bak, what's wrong with you? Bak, don't die on me! Ji Wan Fay, call yourself a friend? Bak, hang in there. Bak! Who sent me this? Are you Lo Chor Bak? That way. You've my word. All will be taken care of. Who are you? I sent this to Bak. Why are you so petty? Weng, this is Hung. Can you find that guy, Cheong Heng, we met at the pub last night? You don't know him? Then, why were you so friendly with him? I don't really know him either. I'd only performed for him once. I don't even have his number. Find him for me anyway. Bye. Ji Wan Fay, come on out! I've had enough ever since I met you. You'd landed me in trouble now. Coward! You're so irresponsible. Show yourself now. I'm going to smash it! Jean, I'm quitting. - What happened? - That's great... Jean, don't worry. I'll get changed right now and let's perform "Farewell my Concubine". Be quick. OK! Put on the makeup! Bak, get ready to be the hostler and make sure you do better flips. Jean, "Rendezvous at the Terrace" it is. - What's with you? - Listen up, Hung! I'll deliver what I've promised. I'm a professional! You just said you wanted to quit. Rascal! Know what it means to keep one's words? Stop it! The show is going to start soon. Are you ready? Hurry up... I regret to return home. In her letter, Mother said she was seriously ill. Father... Gazing at the moon... Lovers are forcibly torn apart. Liang... Liang! Bravo! Gun! Quick, run! Police! You're a cop? Stand up! I almost caught the thief. How are you related to him? I'm not related to him at all, officer. It's normal for us to jump down from the stage while acting. I could sue you for obstruction of justice. I hear you and don't wave your gun around. Can you keep it first? Officer, what's the matter? - It's all a misunderstanding. - Exactly! I didn't do it on purpose! No, officer, he did it on purpose! Rascal, what are you saying? Shut up. Who are you? I'm the troupe manager. Yes. She's the troupe manager. - Is he with your troupe? - Of course! Look, Hung Ba Tin. That's me, I'm the male lead. You've got it wrong. Don't do it again. Thank you, officer! Why did you make such a mess? No! He... I... Let's call it a night. Where the hell has Dad gone to? - Is Hung here? - I don't know. I've something important to tell him. He'd asked a hoodlum to beat someone up. But that guy's a bragger, so it's not happening. Who does he want beaten up? An arrogant guy in the troupe called Lo Chor Bak. Remember to tell Hung. I've got to run. I can't stay with the troupe anymore. Why don't you go to Singapore with me? Your husband treats you badly and your daughter has grown up. What's stopping you? I've some savings. I'll pick you up at 6.30pm tomorrow. Give me some time to think over it. Miko, come over here. "As soon as you set sail" "We're in different worlds" Stop it! It's so annoying! Where the hell were you when that old fart was hugging me? Where were you when I was performing? I didn't have the mood to sing! That Mr Cheong is a fake! How do you know? Didn't you hear him calling out "Mr Cheong"? Call yourself my friend? Instead of telling me, you ran away and left me alone with him! Where did you go? I didn't mean to do it but I was cheated! What about me? I was physically assaulted! I've had enough! You promised you'd possess me and help me do the singing but you didn't and made me look like an idiot on stage! I wasn't in the mood to sing! If you couldn't do it, why didn't you just go backstage and hide? You deserved it! Do you think I'm just helping you? I also wanted to prove myself! That's good. You want to prove yourself and I want to wrap up the show. Let's work together? It's a pity... someone is missing in the audience though. Wan Fay... Old fart! What do you want? I'm Siu Hoi, the valet of Mr Cheong. No wonder. Why did you pretend to be him? You pretended to be Ji Wan Fay so I pretended to be Mr Cheong. Since I was a young boy, I've thought that he was suave and handsome. His eyes were mesmerizing. He was gentle and considerate. Where's the real Mr Cheong? Where's the real Mr Cheong then? He passed away years ago. Why didn't you say so earlier? The real Ji Wan Fay is in trouble now! Miss Wan Fay. Although I don't know what the two of you are up to, please listen to what I've to say. To Mr Cheong, you were the most important woman. What are you doing? Don't tell me you get high so easily? Don't die on me. No wonder the old fart said you were the most important woman to Mr Cheong. "Grave of Cheong Ho Fung and Ji Wan Fay" I don't know if he saw you performed "Rendezvous at the Terrace". But, like the male lead Liang, he chose to be buried next to you. Why didn't you tell me you were with me all these years? Where are you now? Tonight is our last chance. We must finish the show. Auntie Sei. You're here too? I'm going to the market. Are you looking for me? This is for you. What is this? Look at your hand; it's so dirty! Give me one night. I don't do one-night stands! How about three hours? One and a half? How did it go? She told me to wait till the next life. You should focus on your career, just like me. If you were me in my previous life, don't lie to me because that means you're lying to yourself. Focus on the career? Look at you. All you'd cared about all these years was to wrap up the show. You simply couldn't accept the fact that Mr Cheong didn't see you perform. He didn't know how much you loved him. He rejected your love so you were heartbroken! "Reserved" You're right. I wanted badly for Mr Cheong to come watch my performance. But I realised we weren't destined to be in love. Help me wrap up the show. Once you go on stage, you can't leave until you finish the very last line. "Reserved" Scumbag! Where's your mum? She's not going anywhere with you; she's through with you. Mum loves me the most. You don't understand. Your mum loves me. What does she love about you? Have you taken any performance seriously? You insist on taking the male lead but you turn yourself into a clown. Even I understand what dignity is. Do you? Your mum's love for me has nothing to do with the shows. She loves me for other reasons. You'll understand when you grow up. Besides, the mess at Bak's show was a misunderstanding. No point wasting my time with you. I'll go look for your mum. Stop where you are! Shame on you! What are you doing? You're so disrespectful. I warn you. Don't fool around with my mum! My dad's coming back tomorrow. - I'm not fooling around... - Let go of me! I'm serious about your mum! - Let go of me! - We love each other! All right... I promise you. I'll take care of you as long as I live. OK? I'll take you along as well. Who needs you? You can't even take care of yourselves! That's even better. Go visit your mum when you've time. - Wait. - What's up? I'm going to miss the troupe. I want to take one last look. We'll have a better life in Singapore. - Let's go. - Jean. - Uncle Gut! - Dear. Come over here. You don't have to say a word. I already knew everything. Do you have any idea how tough it is to support the whole troupe by myself? How many times had you called us after you went to Shenzhen? I couldn't find you when we couldn't pay the stage set-up. I didn't know what to do. I'm only a woman. I know you'd suffered a lot. You're right. I'm not a good husband. I didn't take good care of you. It's good you know that. Well, since he treats you so well, go with him. Hung. Uncle Gut... Don't say anything. It suffices that you know it in your heart. I don't want to put Jean in a spot. We're both men. If you really love Jean, you've to take care of her for life. Jean, come over here. Listen up, Hung. If I ever find out you're unfaithful to her, I'll even come back from hell to get you. Take her with you. Dad, why are you letting them go? Mum is running off with another man! I'll chase them if you aren't. Stop! Sweetie. You're aware that your mum and I don't get along. We're not happy as a family for a long time now. Look how happy your mum is now. So, why don't you let her go? But she's my mum! She will always be. You've grown up now. I'll need you to manage my troupe now that your mum is gone. I regret to return home. In her letter, Mother said she was seriously ill. The show has started. Father has taken betrothal gifts from Ma's family. The lovers are forcibly torn apart. Bak's performing "Rendezvous at the Terrace". I know. "I've been worrying all day" "That our vows" "Are going to be broken" "The past is gone with the wind" "I mourn in my own room" "Though I'm heartbroken" "I yearn to see you" "But you're nowhere in sight" "Father chose a husband for me" "And I was compelled to marry someone" "Whom I don't love" "What has kept you..." Sweetie. I've to depend on you to manage the troupe from now on. I just saw a red lantern. I've finally seen a ghost. Nobody knows that I had an accident in Shenzhen. I should be on my way to the netherworld but I miss you and the troupe very much. Don't cry, sweetie. Don't you always want to see a ghost? I don't want you to die! I don't want to see a ghost anymore! Don't cry... Life is like a show. There is always a prologue and an epilogue. We've got lead roles as well as supporting roles. Some play the role from start till finish yet others appear only in one scene. I'm just taking my leave during blackout. Don't cry. "We've been living together for three years" "Yet I failed to see through your disguise" "I'm glad that you're an honourable man" "I'm ready to fall in love with you" My servant has always suspected that you're a woman and it turns out to be true. Bye. There are just a few lines left. Why don't you finish it? "I only realised now that you're a woman" "What a blessed marriage this will be" "Let's sing a love song" What's the matter? You can't sit there. Why not? - You even stole my jade? - Miss Zhu... - I like it. - Miss Zhu... You invited me here. Why do this to me now? That's because you're impolite! Wait a minute... What's the matter? Did I tell you I kissed Mr Cheong? No. Let's finish the show. There is one audience member left. "Let's sing a love song." "Together we form a couple" Thank you. Bye. Help me wrap up the show I couldn't finish. Chor Bak, come here. - Why are you crying? - I'm not. - Let me see. - No. I'm not crying. Has she left? It's a pity she still can't finish the whole show. She's an opera diva. She can't leave in the middle of the show. But she found Mr Cheong. That's a consolation. Was my acting good? At least she left happy. I think we managed to bluff her that you're the reincarnation of Mr Cheong. Oh yes, since you brought this up. We almost gave ourselves away just now. Why did you... kiss me all of a sudden? I was in character. The feeling came naturally... What happened? Has the show ended? Why are you so late? Did we miss the show? Let's go and get something to eat then. OK. Let me go remove my make-up. Wash it with laundry detergent! Stop teasing me! Hurry up! Bak, why did you remove your make-up? The show hasn't ended. What's there to perform? All the audience have left. Uncle Gut, when did you get back? Bak, listen to me. Do you know how difficult it was for me to secure this show? We should carry it through to the end. Although it's near the end, you ought to still give it your best shot. Only then can you fulfil the wishes of your previous life. My previous life? How do you know... - Enough said. Let's do it. - Everyone's gone. Are you asking me to perform for the spirits? Can't they be the audience? But I really don't know how to sing "Rendezvous at the Terrace". What about "Endless Love in Phoenix Court"? You sing that all the time. I'll go change the backdrop. Miko... What if the spirits don't like my performance either? Have some confidence in yourself. Stop fooling around! Bak is going to finish the last show. Let's get the backdrop changed. Look at you! - Stop laughing. - Draw your sword... Yes, draw my sword... Wait for me inside, don't come out. We came here specially to see you perform. I'm the only one performing now. I can't do it if I've an audience. The performance is always for the audience. - If not, why bother? - Get out... Stop it. Go. "Separation shatters our love" "My clothes are soaked" "With tears" "As soon as you set sail" "We're in..." "Different worlds" "Birds fly south" "Flying back home" "When will you" "Come back to me" "I feel wretched all alone" "Don't..." "Don't weep" "Don't be sorrowful" "Life is transitory" "We bid farewells" "Every day" "Though I'm unwilling to part with you now" "We'll meet again in our dreams" "Listen to my last consoling whisper" "As I tenderly wipe away your tears" "Don't grieve" "Don't sigh" "One day" "You'll feel the breeze of spring" "Don't weep, don't be sorrowful" "Our love is as deep as the sea" "Our faith is as strong as the mountain" "If your affection for me withers one day" "I could only blame it" "On my own vanity"
