- What is it? - It's a funny place... - And from here? - Taxi, of course. - That man said the road's bad. - Damn him. He isn't escorting a bridegroom. I said I'd get you there! - Something is brewing up in the sky... - Shut up - You there! A taxi...? - Shoo! I got an umbrella... now I can keep my bowl dry. Sister-in-law, will you marry me? Thought of something new? For all my troubles, if I had to marry something like that...! Stop it. Taxi! This way... concessional rates. Double concession. Will we reach Jhalpur by dusk? For a wedding. The auspicious moment is at dusk. No way! That road is a shortcut to heaven. Three streams en route, and all swollen by rains at that. By evening... I said I'd get you there. I will! - Thought of something? - If we reach late... my uncle will beat you black and blue. - Where to, sir? - This seems to be... - Can you get us a taxi? - Where to? It's a long story. We took the wrong train. - My nephew's marriage today. - That's me! We got into a first class compartment for comfort. - Some comfort, really! - Where do you want to go? Can we get a taxi? Sultan! Call Bimal. 2 annas commission. - All right, we'll see... - Come with me. Let's go. You sit here. I'll arrange it. - You won't just walk off? - Shut up! What happened? This place is weird. I don't like it. Is it a graveyard? Careful what you say. He's short-tempered. But he's drinking! ... Yes, I understand. He wants to go to Jhalpur. - When? - Right away - It's my nephew's wedding... - Twenty. Twenty rupees, sir Fleecing me because I'm in a spot? We won't. No wedding for my nephew. - What's he doing? - Don't tease him. Okay... I'll pay. Twenty rupees given, for my nephew's wedding! You sit down there without a word...? - Half down. - What? - Half the amount in advance. - Swindlers! Okay! - Wait at the taxi stand. - Won't swindle us, will he? - Shut up! - I won't! Pay me my money. - Is that something new for you? - It's far gone... croaking! Mind what you say before him. Or, he'll make mincemeat of you. Give me my two annas! Oh, your money! Here you are... sweet kid. One anna? Cheat! Something good? This way it won't even start. We'll sit forever. Sit properly. It's a cursed car! It has us in its wraps. - I'm not staying here. - And go where? I don't know. I don't like this place anymore. God, what's that noise? Out! - What makes you laugh? - He's being funny Get down... Croaking, eh? He's leaving us here. Why play cruel jokes, brother? Had you said, I'd have got off. Why use force? What's wrong? You have reason to be angry. Such a beautiful car... and he says it's croaking! Mind your manners, boy! I punished him. He'll behave. Go push the car. My child, go push the car. You, too, push. No good. Half-hour back he was moaning. Now, even that stopped. Not a soul in sight. Thirsty, Jagaddal? Yes, you're panting. Wait. "Come, see the lights dance" "at the feet of the dark lassie..." Wide hole! Sorry, Jagaddal. Make do with patches now. If I get good charter runs next season, I'll get you... A brand new hood. Honour bright! Lime marks again! Tell me, Jagaddal, what have they got against you? No one dares pick on the other cars... Even the birds envy you. If I catch you messing around, I'll break open your skull What's this, Bimal? Whitewashing a ruin? Beat it! Who asked your opinion anyway? I bought a new car. So I take him to see it. I don't understand why people pry into my affairs. - Affairs? Is the car your lady? - What did you say? Today I will... No excuses. You must take me for a spin today. All right. - What? - I agree - Should I put my shirt on? - Wait at the taxi-stand - What now? - Will you first... take this customer to Ranchi? No, I won't. Sultan... sit down - Know why I'm cleaning the car? - Because you're crazy. Today I'm going to get Jagaddal photographed. Sister-in-law! Will you marry me? - Hasn't Bimal come yet? - No! Boss, I'm going for a spin with Bimal. Netya... Come. That's enough, don't talk. Go stand there. Else I can't take the pictures. But... Will both my ears be in the picture? Can those ears be hidden? Lend me a hand. Pyara Singh changes cars every year. Can't stand old cars. My Jagaddal is a tough one. Other cars keep catching cold. They get tummyaches. Nothing like that here. Come morning... Jagaddal is at his place. They envy him, naturally. What young man wouldn't envy an old man who has a stamina. Who can race and whoop it up all day. How about today? All right, wherever you say. Do you know what the gentlemen at the Bengali Club say? Damn the Bengali Club and its gentlemen! They say worshipping a car for 15 years is not human. They say you must be a machine. - They say so? - Sure! Why that grin then? Acting smart, eh? I'll hit you...! Go stand there. - I want a peek inside. - Forget it. Please! Not that grin. He was wiping lime on the car. You wipe lime on the car, I'll wipe you out! I bought betel-leaf and lime for the car. Sultan, the handle. Isn't this going too far? Calcutta's mail train has arrived. Some other day. - Who's the driver? - I am. - Towards Horab. - Whose house? A relative's. How much? - Fifteen rupees. - Let's go Give us the start and get in. Scares the cows, kicks up dust, and yells if you say anything. Don't you do your daily jobs? All my car's fault, is it? How beautiful the sky looks through this hole. What a rotten car. Feel like tearing the hole to make it bigger. Beautiful combs. I want one. Driver, please stop. I'll get it. - How much? - Four annas How lovely! I'll never lose it. So cheap, just four annas. This is Horab. Isn't there a rest-house nearby? - Right ahead. - Let's go Caretaker! I can't stop it. Get a stone... A stone, you idiot! The gentlemen of Bengali Club. - They put it well. - What did they say? That I'm a machine. I like the smell of burnt gasoline. It gives me a high... What they don't understand is that Jagaddal is also human. These days of high prices... he brings home at least two rupees a day. And runs on next to nothing. 22 miles to the gallon. He understands that I'm a poor man. You always call him Jagaddal? Does he answer? Nice days, aren't they? How long has Jagaddal been with you? About 15 years. He came the year mother died. Been with me ever since. Where are you from, master? You have folks at home? Press the accelerator. I'll start the car. Brought any food? What do you want? - This car...? - Mine - I got to go to Piska. - This car won't go. I'm in great trouble. You wouldn't come to me otherwise. There's no other car around. The Calcutta train... I tell you I won't go. I haven't eaten since we left the stand two days back. The Calcutta train? You have only an hour... But I must go. - What've you brought? - Small pancakes. One anna per piece. Take them back. Rotten stuff, at that price! Back home, at Pala's shop, 4 pieces an anna. Water! I'll take you to Piska. You must pay five rupees. - You didn't eat anything... - Later. Come, We'll miss the train Will you get me there in time? That train is usually late. The way your car looks... That's not your business. If you can't stand it... hold your nose! The Calcutta train. Gone! - The train's left. - It hasn't come yet. You have helped me a lot. God bless you. Tired already? You're growing old. You'll miss the train. "Whoever brings me glass bangles when he returns..." "At the feet of the dark girl..." Why carry on, Bimal? Pension off your old woman... And keep a fashionable whore as you do, eh? - To the fair. - Sure, get in "The bangles, the bangles!" Get tea from Pala's shop. Hey, you drivers! Come here. Ever seen these people? Bechu, see if you know them. The girl was married recently. She's run off with a local Romeo. She's carrying lots of jewelry. See if you know them. I don't know them. Here, take this back. Sir, this thread is broken. Can you fix it? Go buy new cars Bimal was right. Jagaddal is a tough one. Today I'm very angry. Your Bimal is no good. - Dare not...! - I'll say it again. One-eyed buffalo, old horse, lame duck! Such airs! As if their car will run forever. - It has never broken down. - It will! - It certainly will! - Our 'Master' Bimal... He'll learn when everybody laughs at him. We all must go someday. Now let me work. I'll go. But I don't like these airs. Old buffaloes and old cars suck their master's bones. Take this to Mangal and tell him I'm here. Well, Bimal? Not a single passenger? - No. - So what now? I'll make up for it. Take double loads. How long can you carry on this way? Before it's too late... hand Jagaddal to the Exchange and get Maganlal's car. It's beautiful... A 6-cylinder sedan. Forget it. Who'll take so much trouble? Carrying illegal extra daily loads, that's no trouble? Have a smoke. Come on: Ramgarh, Ranchi, Nayasarai... Concessional rates! - The fare! - Sure, get in - There are ten of us. - Get in, get in Ready? It's like a kangaroo's belly. Get down, get down. Wait, wait... That's a car for you! Bimal's taxi is really the limit. A living deity... fulfills your wishes... for your kids. Madman... madman... Madman... madman... Never mind, Jagaddal. You and I... we're together. I've mended that. The hole in the hood. You go in. A ticket for Calcutta. It's the end. The police are on the trail... No husband, no home... Why are you wretches born? So he ditched you? Where now? I don't know. What will I lose on cancellation? At the window. The ticket... What did you say? Jhurni... - I forgot you... I've sinned. - Faithless! Cheat! Is this the station? Yes, Ranchi station. From here our people go. to Assam and Bhutan, to work in the tea gardens. You promised me a silver necklace and earrings. - You're good at sweet words. - You know I've no money. Should I pawn you? Why not go now? Your town is here. We won't go further. We're off. You haven't taken the car out for a month. Other cars, too... break down. And get repaired. - No. - What? It never happened all these years. The oil isn't flowing... The magneto keeps failing, the bearing melted in testing. I'm at my wit's end. Something's wrong inside Jagaddal. - God! - The car has been condemned Everything is old, rotten. You're a good mechanic. Try to understand. You're obsessed! It has clouded the business sense of a miser like you. You're pouring money into it. I brought excellent tobacco from Khatanga. Have some? If you want to survive, get rid of Jagaddal. It's just a lump of iron. Why this attachment? Well... keep trying. But that car won't run again. - Since the boss thinks... - I'll spend as much as needed. Jagaddal won't go ... as long as I'm around. If Jagaddal goes, I'll feel very sad. "The earth is dried up. Not a patch of green in sight" "The heart is breaking, Oh cloud! Where are you?" 133 rupees and 12 annas... A clutch plate... Jagaddal, they say you will have to retire. No! I'm still around. - Do you have ten annas? - No Then why come here? Battery, distributor, axle, piston... All genuine. If you need them by morning, I must send a wire. It's costly. Here's fifty rupees. What are you doing? The stuff will be here tomorrow. But I think it's a waste. Good! All the orders are placed. It'll be great. They say you won't recover... that I'm wasting money. The rats. It's good to think that you'll get well. You'll dazzle everyone. Wait till you take your place at the stand. One moment, I leave the door open, and you sneak in. You've worked a miracle, Bimal. You must take me for a spin today. I've something to do. See you! Come, fly with a winged horse. Can't I win your favour even after giving my all? Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. I've pampered you enough. Today you must decide whether you want to stay or not. This is what I call a load! - Good evening, sir. - Car agent? He has come from Calcutta to buy scrap iron. You have so many axles and rims lying around. Sell them. - What's the rate? - Two rupees for 80 pounds You won't get a better offer. Sell me the whole lot. Is that all? That's hardly four hundred pounds. Why did you make me walk all this way? This too. This has become scrap. What's this, Bimal? This is also junk. Useless stuff. I've got a new bowl! What about the old one? Forgotten it long back. That one with rough edges wasn't any good. This one is round and smooth. See how it shines! It shines! Good-bye, Jagaddal. We part without ill-will. I had your support for long... though it couldn't last forever. I'll take life as it comes. Subtitles by: serdar202
