Jewelry, brand bags, etc. together. He stole several dozen items and fled the scene, leaving the same store. There were several employees, but I couldn't tell. Good morning. Where's Futaba? Not here. Good morning dad. Currently ranked #1 in the nation and unexplained and Want some egg omelette? Yes please. There have been 39 sudden deaths since the beginning of the year.

We're sorry about that, sorry! Hello good morning! Good morning!!! Whoa, good morning! Hello! I saw your quiz yesterday. Thank you. Congratulations, you're the best! Really, thank you very much! What's the length of the longest hair according to the Guinness record? 7 meters 93 centimeters You're the real deal! This way please! You're awesome! Hey guys, Ayaka’s here! Hello everyone! Oh wait please let's take a selfie! Say cheese! Thank you very much! Thanks a lot! Which one do you want? Let me introduce you... Mr. Kenshin! This is Ayaka Ichijo. Nice to meet you! Hello and good morning! Forget about me. Goodbye! No, I’m not giving up! Ai-chan, I promise to stay with you no matter what. But why, what’s the point? We’ll it’s just... Fate. Mom! Sister is gonna be on tv now! Wait I’m not yet done cleaning! The show won’t for you mom! Faster, faster! Whether you believe it or not. The case is happening now. Look sis is on tv, that's sis!!! Oh yeah! This is exciting, it's really her!!! We are honored to have these two guests. First is the number one spiritual medium Kenshin and next is Aika Ichijo, an active female graduate student with an IQ of 200. Hello nice meeting everyone! I'll get right to it, Ms. Ichijo, do you believe in curses? Well not really, I’ve never experienced curses personally. Oh what's this, they're talking about curses? Oh look at the lipstick she's wearing, it's the one I got for her from Shinjuku! So pretty! There's this cursed video and suddenly a lot of unexplained deaths happened. On this one dark website... the cursed video was being sold by collectors. That's how the curse was being spread. What do you say Mr. Kenshin? This is a very serious situation. A long time ago, there was an urban legend. It was very similar to this one. A similar urban legend? It was about a video that should never be watched. If you watch it, you'll die in 7 days. A long haired woman in white dress named Sadako will appear and curse you to death. That's the legend behind the cursed video. But this incident is more horrifying than that. Because they say you will die 24 hours after you watch the video! It's crazy that anyone would sell such a dangerous thing. The scary part is yet to come. Just imagine someone curious about this cursed video. If they were to spread it online, it would take only one day. People all over the world will see it. The number of views could easily explode to 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, and so on It would be the end of humanity. The end of humanity?! Everyone, please don't ever watch this video even out of curiosity. This is a terrible curse. Excuse me, I don't believe it. There goes sister and her logical thinking! I don't think the curse is real. I believe this is just some sort of placebo effect. The people who watched the video strongly believed that they would die within 24 hours because of the curse, and so they died. All the victims? It would be impossible. The curse does exist. Acute heart failure. Someone who strongly believed they were cursed could have been stressed and existing health conditions were triggered. Others, when faced with extreme fear, chose to commit suicide. Whatever happened... science will always be able to uncover the truth. Science will uncover the truth? Science will always uncover the truth! But doesn't that Kenshin guy also have a point? No mom, I don't think so. There's a rumor on the internet that everything’s just a hoax. So it's just a fake? Curses do exist. You gotta be kidding me with this nonsense! Curses don’t make sense. I think curses do exist. Nah this is too fake to be true. So how should one deal with this? Thank you very much for the food, and I'll have the rest in the morning. But even if you call it a cursed video... I'm not cursed by it! Wait aren't you supposed to make a copy of it or something? My brother also watched the video. He also watched the cursed video?! Hey hey hey that's not good at all! Listen, I picked up Facebook. I won't ignore you anymore. I'm home! Mom I’m hungry now. Wait a bit and I'll make dinner for you! The coming of God or the end of God. What is the neuroscientific basis... What is it? This is what science can't figure out. something like ... I'm taking the food. Curry! He replied! What time... Holy mother of Christ!!! We're sorry about that! Sorry! It's fine... It was nice working with you! Oh, nice working with you, too. You're very level headed as usual. I'm sorry, did I say something rude? Must be tough being popular huh? It must be interesting playing a character of one who has an IQ of 200. An IQ of 200 is just a number. I just pursue what interests me. It's all about trial and error. Trial and error? It's all about being able to make a decision to move forward with your findings. Wait, so you really think you’re the real deal? Are you just playing a role Mr. Kenshin? She’s dangerous! Straightforward and refreshing. My whole existence is all about... entertainment. If you say that, you're finished. That's okay, it's the truth. I respect you in a way. I believe that human beings are greedy, frightening creatures. We get bored with mundane life so we seek thrills and danger. And yet, when danger finds us... Then we immediately seek peace. I don't think it's all that bad. I have to go to the next gig. That's the last thing you need to say. But if I may, I'd like to give you this. What is it? It was delivered to me. It's a copy of the cursed video. Would you like to solve the mystery of this curse? Hey, this is the cursed video! Just a copy. Whoa, it’s so huge! You know, we have old videos in the closet at home, and when you were a little girl, you used to sing songs. You used to watch monster movies with your father. Oh really, did I? Thanks for the food! I remember when turtles could fly. It's more like a kuku-kuku. Hey sis, I wonder why in the world he gave this to you. That Kenshin... Oh yeah mom, thanks a lot! You visited dad's grave yesterday. How’d you know that? When I was leaving the house today, there was a Pomeranian hair on the seat of my car. And we know two dogs like that. It's Mami's and Saito's brother's house in Inagi, right? That means mom went there. Is that right? Each year, we offer this to dad's grave, and the other one is for dad over there. Oh yeah it’s there! Dad’s grave is about a 10 minute drive away, and you gave it to father. Damn impressive! There's nothing you can miss! Hey, maybe with your brain, you can solve the mystery of this cursed video! The hell are you saying? Do you know what you’re asking? But I just wanna solve this thing! You always have crazy ideas! Hey this is the one with the flying turtles! Dad I’m gonna have a bit of fun, alright? Oh this looks like it! Hmm what in the world is this? WHAT THE HELL?! Wait what is this... No way! Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Medicine. Water. Curse. Okay, look. Pay attention, it'll be on the test this afternoon. What are you up to? Hey what are you up to? Hey what are you up to? I've had enough of you. Experience? Hey what are you looking at? Hey, is it raining outside? Oh no, weather's good today! Good for you. Maybe I'll go sing a happy tune then! Speaking of Sugiyama, it's Kiyotaka Sugiyama. The prefects have a 1,000-win policy. That's all for today. Hey. Hey. I saw you on Urban Legend last night! Thanks! That’s a weird-ass turtle curse! See you later! Don't come near me! It's really got me! It's her! This is it huh? Sorry! Holy mother of Christ! Hey Futaba, what’s up? I'm not going to die, am I? What's wrong? Last night at around 10pm. I watched the video. You saw what again? I watched the cursed video. If you see it, after 7 days. A long haired woman in white named Sadako will come for you and curse you to death. It really showed up and it’s here! Is the woman dressed in white? Yeah she's wearing white clothes! Does she have long hair? She has... NO HAIR! It's just bald Mr. Shizuoka! That can’t be Mr. Shizuoka. He's in the hospital with a broken leg. Then who is this?! At first I thought, what the hell what's going on! I stopped and approached him, but then he was gone. I noticed he was looking at me from a distance... But it looks like I'm the only one who can see him! I don’t see anyone over there. And he's getting closer and closer! What should I do sister?! I think I've been cursed! Calm down, there's no way Mr. Shizuoka is there, and there's no way you’re cursed. I thought so too, but isn't this very weird? Alright fine, I’ll go see what I can do. Really? Excuse me. Please wait here. Thank you for waiting, Ms. Fujita. Would you be interested in this model? Ok. Thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting. I need to see Mr. Kenshin. Your name is? I'm Ayaka Ichijo. I'm sorry for just showing up, but I really need to see him. Sorry! We're full with reservations. ARGGHH!!! I’LL KILL MYSELF!!! Uhm, excuse me for a bit. I'm gonna kill myself! Ai-chan!!! I’m gonna join you soon! Don't be rash! Don’t give up yet! I’m not gonna be killed by the curse! Just wait a little bit longer! Don’t kill yourself! This is the only way to escape the curse! He who believes will be saved, and he who is strong in heart will make it! If you watch this cursed video, you’ll surely die. I'll die on my own terms!!! If you jump off from there, it will really hurt bad. Free fall from 10 meters, the speed of fall is about 50 km/h Assuming your weight is 60 kg, the impact volume is about 20 tons It's the same as being crushed by a dump truck! Oh shit... Come on, get away from there. Look, isn't there someone wearing white over there? We've got clients with appointments here. Let them in next priority. Understood. I took this. It’s from my social media account. Ai-chan... I'm sorry. It was you. So you're the one who sent the cursed video? Yes. This was taken in front of the village. The back of the house is the front end, but it's still being worked on. Ai-chan asked me for advice, saying she saw a cursed video. Calm down. Is Ai-chan an acquaintance? Yes sir. You just met and then you were already calling each other by your first names? We may have only just met but... It was fate. So that’s what this is. I don't care if you're like that or not. About the cursed video, isn't it said that if you made a copy of it and showed it to someone else, you'll be saved? Is that true? So you saw Sadako’s video. Yes I did watch it. We both watched the video. When did your girlfriend see the video? Just 24 hours ago. I guess that means she was murdered by Sadako. I don't have much time left! I only have 4 hours left! I'll break that curse, leave it to me. Yes, please do everything you can! Why are you coming with me? You might get cursed. I don't believe in curses. PLEASE SIT DOWN!!! Welcome you two. We’ll banish the cursed spirit. Isn't it a cursed video? WAGAWAGAADENOGEMBUTSU!!!! What’s wrong with her?! OFFERING!!! (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) (Ritualistic chanting) WAH! SCARY!!! Are you always this much of a pussy?! Hey isn't that the place we're at? Really... that's interesting. The curse has been lifted. Really? Really? Thank you so much! PLEASE STOP RIGHT THERE!!! Um... why? Why did this place show up at the end of the video? Sadako shows up to whoever watches her video. It's because of her powerful grudge. Damn strong grudge! This could just be fake footage. Like Dwayne Johnson?! What the hell are you talking about? The curse has been lifted. Why are you giving this back to me?! She's gone. Now it's your turn to explain to me the logic behind this curse. Or is it that the IQ of 200 is afraid of being unable to solve this curse? Again, IQ is just a number. Trial and error again, wouldn't you say? Trial and error? Why don't you take the first step in solving it then? Understood. I'll be going. Thank you so much! Seriously, thank you very much! So, wait a minute. I'll join you on this one as well! Really? Because I couldn't help Ai-chan. If only we could figure out the curse. I want to avenge my love in heaven! It is my sister I want to help. Sister?! When did your sister see the cursed video? At 10pm last night. So, in the next five hours, I'm going to figure this out. Neapolitan with lots of green peppers. Thank you very much! Well, that's very appetizing. Where’s your sense of urgency?! Yes? I saw the cursed video. I might be cursed myself. The rhythm of the day is important, so we need to make sure that human cells have a 24-hour cycle. The irregular rhythm of life is designed to cut off in cycles. Irregularities can cause poor health. I don't get it, I don't have an IQ of 200. Oh, I like baseball. Hanshin fan tiger is Ruggiero. You said you'd step out of it. I don't think it's going to be Giants-esque. Know what you should do? You're supposed to make a copy of the video and then show it to someone. That would save you. I read on a website that a man died because of the video. According to someone, the cursed video started when the smallpox virus combined with the cursed video. Smallpox? Yeah smallpox. Schistosoma japonicum virus It has the shortest incubation period. If that’s the case... The fastest way to spread it is by copying and exposing others to it. Yeah, I didn't know that! OUCH! HOT HOT HOT!!! Are you alright? I'm fine. Oh man, that must have been very hot! I'm fine, thank you very much! Thanks I'm good. Can I please get the same coffee? Same coffee? Same coffee please, thanks! Sorry about that! I’m sorry! So about the virus, how does it work again? The virus needs to infect a lot of people before they die. If so, why the very short incubation period? I'm guessing it's been shortened to 24 hours to encourage the infected to spread the curse faster. Oh man what trouble... Just roll it up. Ah wait no I can’t do that. Why, do you have a tattoo or something anti-social under that? Come on really? Well... Well actually I have a matching tattoo with my girlfriend's... Seriously?! Yes seriously. Want me to show you? Nah, not interested. This tattoo on my arm is for me. Even the curse won’t erase it. What the hell is that finger thing you do? It’s like you’re sniffing it after scratching your ass. Definitely not! CRAP! Only 10 minutes left! I’m about to die!!! Hey mom, what is it? I'm meeting up with Futaba after work right now, and we're going to talk about the cursed video. We've got something, we're gonna figure this thing out one way or another! I trust that you can quickly save Futaba. Thanks a lot. I'm gonna die ain't I? His hair is growing. FUTABA!!! Mom! Are you ok? Mom! It's here, it's following me! What?! I don't see anyone. Seems like he's gone. I'm glad he's not here. Huh, what is it? That freaky long haired thing is here! Go away! What are you talking about? Go away! Go away!!! Wait! What the hell is wrong with you? Come back here! If the suspicious deaths were caused by a virus, then, medically speaking, finding the serum should be able to cure them. Making a copy and showing it to others is the only way to save yourself, but that doesn’t work anymore. We gotta figure out another way. There's no time left!!! Oh my god no... That cursed spirit is around here... Sorry for freaking you out, here's your coffee! Can you please be a little quiet? Take your time. I'm dying here! Please can you stop being a pussy for a moment? Sadako isn't here yet. It's past time! That clock is running late. LATE?! It really makes no difference that I watched the video last night for 8 hours. TOO CLOSE! It must have gotten someone else. Mr. Kenshin! Mr. Kenshin have been the one who died! Thank you for dying for me! What's a cat doing here? TOO CLOSE!!! This is Kanden, another person investigating the case online. They've been looking into this case... That’s cool! Nice seeing you again Mr. Kanden. I can’t hear anything. Hey hey hey! I need to see your face so I can verify your identity. You're not supposed to see my face. You can see me but I can't see you? I value my privacy thank you very much. Now what?! Can we trust this cat? Maybe he's the one who sold the cursed video?! I can hear you, but I have some information, so what are you going to do? I still don't know if we can trust you Fumika. Come on Ayaka-chan... Stop saying my real name! So what have you found out? I'm okay with this story. Ai-chan! She looked towards something not far off. When you looked, you saw nobody there. Still, it looked like she really could see something. Then something invisible choked her. Really, it’s got me! Ai-chan I'm sorry! I didn't have the strength. She was then pulled away. She got spun on her head and died. Ai-chan!!! It seems that only those who were infected... can see, feel, and experience the virus and then die. Sorry. Hey be quiet. What do you think are the reasons for this type of behavior? Now, up to that point, it's just the incubation period of the virus. I was wondering why the time frame has been shortened to 24 hours, and from an evolutionary perspective... It's survival of the fittest. I mean, they survive by adapting and mutating to their environment. Why did they have to make it 24 hours? If you kill the host, the virus itself will die. Exactly! We find out the reason, we solve this mystery! Mental fortitude. How can you keep calm in such a situation like this? Aren't you scared by this? Yes I am. Someone you thought would always be there for you... suddenly disappear... Man this is tough. Ayaka is really the smart one in the family! Dad's very proud of you! But now it's time for you to make a choice to step forward. I thought it would go on forever. Life can just change so suddenly. I don't want to go through that again. Survival of the fittest That means Ayaka Ichijo was at the park too, right? Ayaka-chan... I said don’t call me by my real name. Oh come on really... I wonder how the Sadako virus would have been edited if it had such a life and death experience. VHS is an obsolete product. In order to continue existing... it had to adapt with the times. Yes that's true. I only have about an hour left. Do you still have the video that was exorcised? Yeah. Let's watch it again! You're kidding me. Just do it! Kande see you later! I can't believe you wanna watch that thing again. I got an idea. Let's watch it somewhere but not at Kenshin's place... Maybe at your place. It's a 20-minute cab ride from here. That's why we need to get going NOW! I'd like a check, please. Yes, thank you. 2,080 yen please. Hey where did you run off to? Please stop, don’t you see the freaky ghost here?! MOM hurry open the door!!! Wait I’m looking for the keys. Wait don’t rush me, do you really need to go to the toilet thad bad? What the hell’s wrong with you? Are you alright? Futaba, what now?! Thanks for paying for the cab, I’ll repay you later! Don’t worry about it. I have to do things right! Recycle shop? A prince? It used to be a newspaper store. Now it’s used to recycle old things. Wait is this it... Oh wait, come this way! Faster! You sure love putting your face on everything. The beauty of a person is... It's all in the mind. Play it. Here goes. Wait, shoes!!! Oops sorry! There were things I couldn’t understand about Ai-chan. Now I understand what she wanted to tell me. What are you doing? Watching it frame by frame for clues. To make sure there are no subliminal messages of any kind in there or anything. It's extra scary down there. Futaba! Dad! Don’t come near me! Dad save us! Faster faster faster! I can copy the background music and still be fine... We can still be alive after 24 hours. This means there’s something else that triggers the death. I’ll hold this so it won’t open! That’s just outside! I’m scared! There was no subliminal message. Oh, that's right. I got up in the morning. This is bad, we’re out of time! I can hear everyone again! Who could this be at this hour? Hey it’s the cat guy! What? The number of people who watched the cursed video from Kenshin... I don't think that has anything to do with it. I was saved because I had the doctor exorcise me. That's not what I meant. So what is it then? Maybe he's lying. That must be it... That's what I have and then we all watched the video. The virus may have been dispersed and infected. In the first place, vaccines are administered with minute doses of the virus to obtain immunity! The same is true for us. In other words, if we all look at it together. I can't be sure but that's all I can think of right now! Futaba please answer! We’re out of time! Please! We’re past the limit. I hate to say this, but... If only you believed in curses... Then you would have brought your sister to the exorcist. You wouldn’t have let her die. What's your point? In this world. There are things that equations cannot solve. And I've been saved, which is more than I can say for most of them. Mom? Ayaka. How’s Futaba? She’s right here. I watched the video like Ayaka told me to. Then Futaba was saved! Sister! Is the thing chasing you gone? Yeah it’s gone. I'm really glad. I wonder if they’ve solved it. Are you guys alright? It's nuanced, like an infection caused by a new kind of virus. The way to save the day was to spread the word on social media! I knew there would be no more victims. Wonderful. IQ 200 Excuse me. Thanks! Thanks for your help Mr. Kanden. It’s not over for me yet. What do you mean? They haven't found the person who sold the video yet. I don't know what he's after, but he's the source. Why are you so obsessed with this case. Honestly, I just don’t want to get bored. To be precise, I don't want to go outside with germs all over the place. I guess it's just a way for shut-ins to pass the time when they step out of their rooms. You might just change the world. I'm not that type of guy, so they're going to make it impossible for me to go back if they figure out what's going on. Good night! Okay, I'll take this one. Don't say my real name. Come here. No, thank you. Please don't. Sorry, it was the alcohol. I went a little overboard. I'm fine. My sister is safe. If you'd like, I'd be happy to give you my contact information. I really thank you for your kindness. If not for you, I would’ve jumped to my death. I really owe you a lot! Jumping down from there will only hurt you. You saved me from the curse and gave me back my smile. I’m sure things would’ve turned out fine even if I wasn’t there! I told you before. There are things that equations cannot solve. And people's feelings. You can't solve it with equations. What the hell... Why are you saying these things? It’s all because of fate. I forgot about the prince. Well then time to get going... Let me take you home. I’m fine no thanks. The cursed video is I suspect a new type of virus, and the treatment is. Watch the video again with someone with as many people as possible! By doing so, we can gain collective immunity to the virus! Yeah, guys. All you have to do is watch. Good night. Good night. Go to sleep quickly! Yes! Isn't this going to cut into your work? Chewbacca! Chewbacca! Kenshin Kivonne Part 2! Sister! Ayaka. Mom! Thanks. It's thanks to Ayaka that we’re here. (Drunk Singing) Man it’s so hot tonight! It must have been Shizuoka who approached Futaba. That’s what I’ve been saying. So it was Shizuoko right? Then he changed afterwards. Didn’t you see it mom? I didn't see it. But Futaba could see it. This is just like Kenshin said about curses. No, probably a hallucination caused by a viral infection. Really? If he gets the virus, his body's immune system kicks in and he doesn't get get affected right away. After 24 hours, the virus gradually increases in number, and finally, the patient develops the disease. In the process, someone close to the person becomes Sadako. I think they're causing the hallucination that they're getting closer. I'm surprised it's so loud. What is this? What happened after the shrine in high school in the case of the cursed video? Show it to us. The chat is so cute! Go to Kenshin's parents' house The #1 spiritualist’s parents’ house?! You’re saying he’s the one who started all the trouble?! Wait a second, those are some heavy accusations! That's what they call slander. This is how it should be. I’m sure about it. What does that mean? I don't believe that you can explain it to me. There must be some mistake, Mr. Kenshin. It’s all about entertainment. This is my brand of entertainment. We're offering the world... something unique. I'm more or less the same way you think. There is no such thing as the ultimate thrill in this world. I believe it's all a business exploitation. You lied to so many people! The main point is supply and demand. (Ritual Singing) Evil spirits who have arrived at home with broken bowels will also be calmed down. Thank you. I was born into it. I realized that this world is based on supply and demand. People want peace. But on the other hand. They also want excitement. Caught in a whirlpool...the bottom is allowed to stand in front! I am committed to meeting this demand. (Ritual Chanting) (Ritual Chanting) (Ritual Chanting) Various lore and ghosts People demanded them. Meeting that demand. I believed it was my mission. I took the first step, you know. Did you let people die just to spread this?! That stuff was just superstition. So you made things up? What with the psychic boom. There were necessary sacrifices. You preached about the supernatural and the belief that there are things science can’t answer! I also believed in your exorcism! You’re here... Ichiki Ayaka You lost. What are you talking about? Curses exist even though they cannot be explained! They simply exist. Get your arms off of me! Hey, this is bad! No way! This is impossible! You're not Sadako. This is not possible! Leave me alone! Curses... Curses cannot harm me! What the hell is going on?! Stop messing with me! Sadako! All right. This isn’t real. This is just entertainment. Holy shit! I thought it was over but I guess it’s not! I thought once you’re past 24 hours, you’re safe! I thought we wouldn’t die if we watched it together! There’s something else going on here that we haven’t solved! Sir? Sir you’ve got appointments today... Manager. Sir... This is no time to sleep, sir. We’re screwed. Outta my way! Asshole cops! What are you looking at? Kenshin-san. God damn! What’s wrong with the cops?! What's wrong with the police? They’re just too noisy and horrible. It's already in the news. They’re fast when it comes to deaths! No this isn’t possible! You’re not Sadako! It changed forms along the way. First of all, he had a humble VCR. Why in the world would anyone have a VCR nowadays? Anyway, why did your brother watch that video? Just out of curiosity. Mom I’m home and hungry! Oh crap, I forgot to cook dinner! What do we have here? I thought it was a fake psychic car. Kenshin was supposed to be proven a fraud right, but I guess... there’s gonna ba a part 3 to that story. As you say, Mr. Kenshin. Maybe it's people like this who really scare me. Entertainment huh? Is it you, are you really back?! Ah nothing, it’s over between us. I’m over with my girlfriend. Wait, what did you just see?! Nothing! Look, that lady in the white dress is your mom. Mom! The thing changed its appearance. It’s trying to get to me. These are people we know... But why are we seeing them. What do we need to do? Wait! How are we gonna get out of this?! Please stop! Watch out it’s shadow clone! What clone? Why are we still alive? I don't know yet, but I don't believe in curses. God damn it!!! I thought you don’t believe in curses? I still don’t believe it but... Maybe there are things science and equations still can’t solve! That’s what I think now. You don’t sound like yourself after saying that. What the hell are you even babbling about? I was just trying to act cool. You helped me out, so I want to return the favor. You know, just like a prince in fairy tales. A prince? You kept helping me... I felt like I was the princess. I'm the prince, right? And I think I've seen my destiny. So what do you say let’s get it on... What are you thinking at a time like this?! isn't it? I'm a bit of a sucker. I'm the kind of person who would get a tattoo like this without thinking twice. That's how people feel. It's an equation to solve. I can't turn it off. It’s a curse. Assuming this video was spread on social networking sites, in one day. The exponential views would curse the entire world! Humanity will perish! The Sadako virus will reach all over the world. Sadako has been considered an edit for the current era. What do you mean? Information leaked to the Internet will never be erased again. That kind of thing is called a digital tattoo. Information about the cursed video can never be erased again. Sooner or later, Sadako will be all over the world. So that’s what Sadako is trying to achieve! There is no such thing as death in viruses. Too late! It’s already been viewed so many times! And it’s my fault for spreading it! Hey, it’s coming for us. Infection is already spreading fast. Please, we need to find the solution to this cursed video! Do you have any ideas? One question I haven't been able to figure out is why the virus has a 24-hour incubation period. Sadako was acting weird during the initial copy transfer. If you did your job, you might have some leads on where you were copying the hostages. Mr. Kenshin got the video. Let’s go to the shrine! Wait! Let go of my hand, you pussy!!! Please don't wait for us. Here goes! There’s no turning back now! I know, this is it. Wait it says no tresspassing! We can’t just break the law! Wait we’ll get cursed if we keep going! We’re already cursed you dummy! The curse... What if the effects stack on us? So what, same result! Looks like it hasn’t been touched in a very long time. What are those things? A newspaper article at the time stated One by one, the inhabitants of this area died suddenly. It was a ghost town, with one sudden death after another. I didn't think it was a cursed video. I don't want to hear any more about the possibilities. Futaba! Let’s go!!! Hey what... Let's see if we can find any clues. SHIIIIIIT!!! This is unbelievable. He really is such a pussy. Mr. Kanden? Hello! By the way, do you like my get-up? Looks cool right? Oh man what just happened? Wait a second, please stop. Nice to meet you! Gotta disinfect first. Are you sure you're all right, being at home? I was bored and going crazy. So I thought it’s time for me to step forward. I'm supposed to think it's more important than that, but it's all over the Internet. The only way to find the clot quickly is to spread it. I investigated this area but this is all that’s left. Just this. This is where they copied the cursed video. After we’re done here... I hope there will be people who will help us form a new group. You really should hurry up. We’re fine don’t worry. Nobody can keep up with the speed of a car. What happened?! It’s your dad, I just saw your dad over there! That is definitely not dad! Quick, drive!!! But your dad! Let’s get outta here or we’re gonna die!!! It’s my sister. Futaba! Sister where are you? We're at the shrine, how long til you get here? We’re getting closer! I'll be waiting for you in the main hall. Sister is already waiting for us! What is it? Dad’s clinging to the car! Mom, focus on driving!!! DON’T LOOK!!! Are they coming? My mom and sister are on the way. Looks like they'll be here in five minutes. I’m glad. Let’s all go home with a smile on our face. Now you called me by name for the first time. I'm scared, but I'm not scared either, I'm taking a step forward. We’re not out of trouble yet! Ayaka-chan... You said you were afraid of losing someone who has always been there for you. That's all I'm afraid of losing. You’re important because you have someone you care about. I think that's a blessing. Sniff my finger. What the hell, you care for me so now that ghost looks like me?! Oh shit this is truly some freaky stuff!!! Please stop being a pussy for once. It’s already here, the ghost is here!!! Wait don’t rush me, I’m working here. Please I’ll do anything for you, just save me! Being calm is the best way to find a solution. It won’t stop looking at me! VOMIC. Futaba! Where are they, they should be here by now! Wait are you alright? Yeah I’m fine, just need to take my meds for my 10 years of widthrawal. Wait 10 years of widthrawal?! Yep, I haven’t gone out of my room in 10 years. This is my first time out of home. This guy truly has no social life! Please get on it, they’re getting closer! Just a sec, gotta drink water. Taking the first step means... It's also about changing the rhythm of your life. I've already really put it out there. You watched the cursed video with two people. If you let them out of the room, the world might change more than you think. I wonder why there was a slight difference in 24 hours... if the host was killed, the virus would not be spread. They'll die out. I saw that. I should help out Ai-chan. Wait a second, Ai-chan didn’t really watch the video with you right? Ai-chan covered her head with a blanket because she was so scared. Faster, play it. Please do it now. I was wrong, the clue wasn't humanity. It was closer to home... closer to home. What does it mean when a human cell is 24 hours old? It is said that we are able to cycle because of the presence of clock cells in the body. That's what we're trying to do. We always thought that the virus was always trying to spread. Like sleeping, eating, and taking medications every day. Just keep ingesting the virus and building antibodies in your body. In other words, the equation for this problem is If you don't see the video in 24 hours, you will die. That would explain why we are alive! So we have to constantly get the Sadako virus? Yes, we have to keep watching it. What do we do? What else? We’re almost there! Dad is here! Let’s get out of the car!!! Mom stop staring and start running! I can’t run anymore! Mom come on get up get up!!! Where are you guys? We’re near the shrine but we need help!!! Just run to the top without stopping! Mom I said stop staring and start running!!! Mr. Kande! We need to make Futaba and mom watch this video! Yeah, we gotta set up the tv here. If you declare that you will abandon your dogs together If you don't let them die... Come on, help me set up the tv and vcr here. Dad, I'm sorry. But we gotta run away from you right now! Mom get a hold of yourself, that’s not dad!!! Let’s set it on that table down there! Hey, do you have the cursed video? I don't have the cursed video. There might be a copy in that room please get it. FASTER!!! Yes, got it! I need a cursed video, where is it... Wait do you know where the cursed video is? Do you have it now? It’s probably just laying around there somewhere! This way, this way, quickly. Ayaka! Wait you’re not one of those things are you?! Power is on. Let’s do this! Here we go! Stop being distracted! Watch the tv!!! We’re screwed! How much time do we have left? What is this? Where are we? I can’t take this anymore! Something should come out of there... Watch the tv and don’t turn away!!! Sadako!!! She’s really here!!! Yeah, infect us with your virus! It’s the only way we can live! Even if we live... No matter how you look at it... It’s still a curse! Guys, what’s going on? Guys what the hell, you can do this, don’t die! We’re 24 hours. We’re all alive. Futaba! Come quickly! It still showed our location at the end. Thanks for saving all of us. Please return my cab fare. Yes! Mom, it’s time! Yeah yeah. Wait a minute. We’d be cursed if we miss it! It’s safe! So you watch it every 24 hours and you’ll be safe? SAFE! You should see it every day. I watch the cursed video every day. 9:53 p.m. Hey aren’t you coming? I’m all good. Mom! You’ll be fine. I'm sure there's someone out there who cares about you. They’re all just playing around. That’s how I feel. You know what I think? There's a man who's interested in you. REALL?!?! Oh I gotta go! You guys have fun! Hey wait what?!?! That's right, before it drops, and you're going to watch it with me? You probably don’t know how to relate to people, that’s your equation. Hey Chaturon. Hey Chaturon! I thought I'd take another step too. It's less boring outside. I think it's good. It's embarrassing. Oh wow who’s that handsome guy?! Handsome?! It's been a long time since I've had a fresh drink, even if it's a bit of a hot one. I'm gonna take your food down. Takashi! Thanks for everything. Thanks for the food! Takashi! I can’t believe it, he finally came out of his room! Here you go! And then I'm going to eat curry. We haven’t seen dad in a long time. Come on mom, you know that’s not dad, stop it. That’s not dad so give me the food! Ok fine. People’s feelings are the unsolvable part of the equation. Just 5 minutes to 10! Ok let’s get this over with. Here goes! It did not rewind?! Uh oh, god damn obsolete machine. Can’t really trust old machines. I’m screwed!!! Hey maybe you can still make it! No need to rush. I’ll just take my pretty time here... Ceiling’s leaking? Okay, I'll call you back when I'm done. OUT OF BATTERY!!! Hey just a second... The hell? What are you doing there? Come sit here. Ah, this is the one. You can’t miss watching this. This is really important ok. Are you watching it too? The emission rules are...
