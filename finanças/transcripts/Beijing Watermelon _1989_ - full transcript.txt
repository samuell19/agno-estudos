A Nobuhiko Obayashi Movie Come on up! Beijing Watermelon Beijing Watermelon Come get your produce here! Beijing Watermelon May, 1989, Japan We were filming a movie in Funabashi, Chiba, with a group of young actors and students from China. This film is based on the true story about a Japanese grocer and a group of Chinese students. Shut up. I already know. How many years do you think I've been doing this? Well, then... Around the time the sun rises The boss comes home Ah, what a carefree life With the tracks so wet, I don't think Dairinyo's gonna win the race. It has a good last push so you never know. Today I'm buying consecutives from number 5. - What do you think of 5-6? - 7-8 all the way. - No, 5-6 is my mother's birthday. - Stop clowning around. - Hey, there's a great daikon radish here. - Cut it out. It's so confusing! With so much rain, the daikons are pretty thin. Yes, Horikoshi residence. My sweet honey works so hard... That's expensive! This is good! 30 yen! Oh shoot, I'm late! I'm gonna get another earful from the boss. - Good morning. - Morning! Welcome back! Boss, we're here. You must be tired. Welcome back! What's going on? How can you read manga in the morning? - Yumi, you hurry too! - Okay! But it's really interesting. Oh, what a great orange! Shut up! How things have changed. The kids used to get so excited when I got home. Nowadays, they don't even care. Look like it'll be a hot day. Hey, Yasuo! Hurry up and get more boxes! I heard that people who read too much manga don't make it in life. I don't care about making it big. Oh no, today's sunny? That means there's gym! This sucks. - Honey, how much is the daikon today? - 100 yen. Dad! Should I make it in life? What are you saying? It's all about how you look at things. Okay, here's your newspaper! Don't hit my head! Have a good day! Boss, are you calling it quits? I stick to my budget. Horse races are good, clean fun. Plus, it's around the time the shop gets busy. - We've only lost today. - Idiot! We'll win next time. Hope is key when betting on races. Hope, huh? - Bye, bye! - See you again. - Ma'am. - Welcome! Cucumbers and tomatoes! Welcome! Which tomatoes? Ma'am, you can just get everything at the supermarket. I only buy meat there! Well said. Take a look at our fruits and vegetables. The freshness and prices are much better here! Ma'am, you're too kind! Fresh - Cheap - Best Service See? Yaoharu's vegetables are number one. Thank you so much. Hey, 100 yen for a cabbage? Can't you do something? I can't compete with you. Alright, I'll make it 10 yen more! - 110 yen? - Stop fooling around! That's why I like you! Thank you very much. Here. - What about tomatoes? - Oh, I don't need any... Oh, hi! What are you doing here? Thanks again! Thank you! I'll be back tomorrow. Welcome! Thank you! He's still here. - What could he want? - Public health inspector? Don't be stupid. Why would they come here? It's just that... he's been doing that for so long. Think he's making fun of us? Maybe he's a spy. A spy? You know, from the supermarket... - they're inspecting. - I'm off again! Are you joking? Why would they need to spy on an open store like ours? We do pretty well here. I bet they came to check out the prices. No way. Yumi, I told you not to use the store entrance. It's fine. There aren't any customers. Yes, there is... Hey, go sprinkle some cleansing salt. YAOHARU GROCERS Hey, honey, he's here again! That strange guy from yesterday. - Oops! - I'm home! Welcome home! You must be wet! Honey, stay calm and peaceful, okay? It's 50 yen for one? That's expensive. Expensive. Hey, are you trying to haggle with me? Hey, careful. Can you close your umbrella inside the store? I want some of these but they're all expensive. I can't buy them. Well, then don't buy them. I can't do without vegetables. Do you know what you're saying? Our vegetables aren't the same as the ones you find elsewhere. Look at the gloss on this... never mind. If you're not buying you're in the way, so please leave. I can't stand it. He's trying to haggle. - Gotta be joking. - I think he's foreign. - Are you Chinese? - Yes! I'm a student from China! - Oh, I see! - We're not expensive! Well, it's not that we're expensive, but it appears expensive to a person from China, right? - Yes, it's not that you're expensive. - In China, this is 5 yen. 5 Yen? It's a different country! What can I do? - Give him a discount! - No way. He's been coming here like this since yesterday! No way. You gotta be kidding me. Come on! If you skip the race tracks for a day, we can recover the loss! - What are you saying? - The races are about hope, right? Be quiet! What do you mean, "hope"? Fine, so how much would you buy it for? 10 yen! What a joke! That's 50 yen! I'd be losing money. No way. Why don't you decide by playing a game? You know, janken. If you win, he gives up and goes home. Cucumbers, please! But if he wins, he gets it for 10 yen. What's janken? Hold on, please... It's a game -there's scissors, rock and paper. Oh, I know it! We have it in China too! Great, this will be quick. They do it in China too! - What? - Janken! Alright, let's compete for it. Hey, he's all ready to go! Fine. Just one try, okay? Ready? Wait... If you lose, you have to go home, okay? Oh, I've already lost to your intensity. Ready... Janken, PON! I won! Yes! I won. Great, just take them all! - Well then, this... and this... - 10 yen. All 10 yen. - This too. - Hey, just the bok choy! Hey, we didn't say eggplant and tomatoes! - Just take them all. - Honey, you lost! 50 yen, please! - We're home. - Welcome home. I bumped into Toru, so we came back together. Oh, together, huh? Hey, I told you, not through the store. He says we can't go in this way. Hello! Thanks again for yesterday, ma'am. Oh, welcome... He's here, honey. Oh, you again! No, no. Not today! You'll lose again. No confidence. - What the hell did you say? - Honey! You see, we can't play janken everyday... We have to sell, otherwise we'll go out of business. Yes, yes, it's true. - So give up and go home. - Sorry, dear! Honey... Hey. - This is it, okay? - "It"? I'm saying this is the final time. The rules can be the same as yesterday. - Mom... - What is it? - This is the last time, okay? - Stop wearing my jacket! You have others! Where did you learn that? You ready? Ready... Janken, PON! I won! Too bad. Hey! Aren't you buying anything? I'm off! I feel sorry for him. Don't. That's life. Shun, you're really too nice. Yeah, that's just pushing it! You're way too gullible. Right? Isn't he way too gullible? You always get so worked up. That's why you got tricked. I don't get tricked. Come on, what good does it do you to play games with a Chinese? - I didn't do it because I wanted to! - Beer, please! Hurry! - Thank you. - Did you run here? Yep, you should run too. You've been looking pale recently. Hey, isn't the Chinese student from that dorm on 2nd Street? - Yes, yes! - He must be! - Why do you look so happy? - She likes Chinese men! - Buy some sneakers and run. - What was that hand movement? Stop it, it's not that I like Chinese men... I like the students! They're half your age! That doesn't matter... Oh, I don't mean it in that way! You're shrieking. - She doesn't treat Japanese kids the same. - The students there are good kids. - Real good hearts. - Mama, drink up. Yes! I won! Why did you play janken? - Why did you play? - I don't know. It just kind of happened. - Why? - I didn't want to do it. Okay, do janken with me too. And If I win... - I get discounts for a whole month. - No way. - Great idea. Do it. - You won't with a Japanese? I'm pretty good, you know. Just play against one of us. And we'll give discounts. - Yeah? Okay. - So you're going to discount your land? - I can't do that! - I'm gonna play! I wonder why we do that! Let's do this! What is that? Fortune-telling? Alright, ready. Okay, I'm good to go. Janken, PON! I lost. - Let's do janken. - Janken? And if I win, there's these shoes I want... - Oh, so that's why. - And if I win, I want a small TV. What are you talking about? We already have one. Don't be silly! Oh... What was it? I've definitely seen this scene before! - What are you on about? - I've seen this before! You know, in a dream or something. - Huh? - What do you want to say? - You're talking gibberish. - You can't pull off lines like that. Janken poi poi One more time Did you say it's okay for only 5 yen? You okay? What are you guys doing? That's dangerous! You okay? Oh, it's you. What happened? Oh, we're going to the hospital. - Hospital? - Yes. He suddenly fainted this morning. - I'm home! - He's suffering from malnutrition. - That's pathetic. - It's not pathetic. Make him eat properly. What? I'm not his parent! (Together I'm gonna call Beijing) He needs to eat nutritious things like... (We tell Beijing we need some Chinese medicine for you) green peppers, carrots, cabbages and tomatoes... - Oh, that's Tom's tripod. - And oranges and bananas. Or strawberries. - Yes, yes. - Colorful things. Sorry for the trouble. Here. - Oh, thank you. - I'll go then. - Where are you going? - Shopping. - For what? - Nutritious things. Don't be stingy and buy good things. - Want me to go? - No, I'll go. - Feed some to the patient too. - Okay. This is nutritious... Hey, no shaking! - He needs to rest. - Sorry. Japan, China, Friendship. Japan, China, Friendship. Looks good! - Mother, can you take this too? - Yes, yes. You're such a great cook, Chen! Can you get me a small plate? A small plate? Coming right up! Oops, I had forgotten about chopsticks! Here, Yumi. Oh, thank you. Please eat up. What's going on with your nose? What do we do with you, Toru? Stop taking so long. Hey, go change first. - You think Li is okay? - I think so. - You sure? - Please eat, Mother. Well then, don't mind if I do. Yasuo, you can go now. Just be on time tomorrow! I have no plans tonight. I can stay. - Really? - Yep. Li, I'm so glad you're feeling better. Really. I guarantee I'll hit a home run tomorrow! - What? - C'mon, stop being silly! - Please stop cooking and come have a drink. - Thanks. I know a doctor shouldn't say this. But instead of getting an IV, it's so much better for you to eat stuff like this! - Okay? So eat up. - How do you say "delicious" in Chinese? Hao chi. - Hao chi? - That's right. Hao chi! Haoyummy! Yes, very hao chi! Hen hao chi. - Huh? - Hen hao chi. It means "very delicious." Hen hao chi. That's right! Everything here's really hen hao chi! Take this and that too! Eat lots of our vegetables, gain strength, study hard and become great people! Our vegetables are hen hao chi! And hen cheap! So, how much do you live on? - How much? - Yeah. 80,000 yen. - A year? - That's right. We each do. Really? To tell the truth, Father... I'm studying Japanese, so I'm fine, but he's studying Japanese architecture. He wants to study it but... Obviously he doesn't have the money to go see all of Japan's different architecture. Ah, that's true. I've come all this way. It's unfortunate. It's pretty modern, isn't it? Yes, it's great. - Do they have these in Beijing? - Yes, of course. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Look, that's the "Big Egg." - Big Egg? What's that? - Where they play baseball. - Ah! Baseball field! - Do they have baseball in China? - Of course. Tokyo Tower! Great, huh? It's amazing. - Does it fit in the photo? - It's a little out of frame. Pretty great, huh? You'll get a great view of the buildings. - Really? I want to see them. - Up here? - Yup. - Watch out! Sorry! Chen, hurry! Look at the graffiti. - His hair looks like a cauliflower! - Perfect for Shinjuku. Cauliflower? There are some that look like parsley. How many floors is the tallest one? 55, I think. - 55? - Yeah. When was this highway built? Huh? Hmm... that was when the Tokyo Olym- Li! Come eat your lunch! Okay! - Why don't you take this? - Can you move? Oh, I'm in the way? - Mr. Yaoharu, thank you so much for today. - Don't worry about it! - I mean it. - China doesn't have this, right? My dear ocean! My dear ocean! You are like a mother to me That's a nice song! You are like a mother to me That's a nice song! What is it? It's about the ocean. Oh, we have a good one in Japan too! Oh, yes? "The ocean is vast and big" My dear ocean! The ocean is Vast and big You are like a mother to me The ocean is Vast and big You are like a mother to me Wow! They fit really well! Wow! They fit really well! I'd love to go to a foreign country No matter where I go, you are always with me I'd love to go to a foreign country No matter where I go, you are always with me No matter where I go, you are always with me You're both in a foreign country, huh? You're both in a foreign country, huh? Yes. Thank you so much! Welcome! - Excuse me. - Yes? That's 35 yen for 100 grams. What are you doing? Where's the boss during a busy time like this? Seriously... Since you're here, I know he's not at the race tracks. Maybe it's a lover. Don't be stupid. Go do the deliveries! - Okay! - It's busy, so hurry back! Lizuka, two daikon radishes? Yes. They're 130 yen. That idiot! Yes, yes. Careful, careful! - I'm taking it now! - Make me look pretty! Okay, okay. This way. Oh, you moved a little. The Japanese and Chinese Great Buddhas have very different faces. Their faces? This one looks deep in thought. Oh yeah? And how about in China? Hmm... They look more animated. - Animated? The Great Buddha? - Yes. Is there a livelier Buddha face? A Buddha's gotta be thinking hard! All these shrines and statues weren't great for studying architecture, huh? No, it's okay. Everyone had fun. Thanks. Don't think so hard. You look like the Great Buddha. The Great Buddha? Actually, more like a father. - What do you mean? - Because you're kind. The boss is late again. It's becoming frequent. I'm home! I'm exhausted. Hey, aren't you gonna ask? Ask what? I don't know... Like "Where did you go?" or" With who?" Where did you go? With who? When you say it like that... - Get this! - Huh? It's going to blow away! You abandoned the store and went sightseeing in Tokyo. And our mini van... It's not a tourist bus, you know. Stop dwelling on the past. On the past? - It's over now. - Every single day now... you give them extra stuff and discounts. - Can you get my jacket? - We're in the red because of that. Take a look at the last few days! I need 1,500 yen for my English books. Get it from your dad! - Stop shouting. - What? - I know all that already. - Turn off the TV and go upstairs... - stop dilly-dallying! - You're the one who felt sorry for them. I can't hear over you! I know I said that but it doesn't mean you have to do all this. Stop shouting! I told you to turn it off. - Why'd you do that for? - Go to bed! Come on! Go sleep in your own bed! Hey, Yaoharu! Yaoharu! - I told you that, yes. - Mama, you got any more beer? If he just sleeps like this, then this won't be an officers' meeting. He's a goner now. How is it that someone who can't drink is an officer? What are you saying? Like sliding doors, you have to wax them sometimes to move them. - Same thing. Right? - Right! Too much wax for you! Your eyes are sliding everywhere! I have to loosen up my tongue. He's special. He's asleep. Doctor! Emergency patient! The union's busy right now. - I called but... - Her phone call's so long. Okay, I'll call you back later. Wake up and let's drink. Scared me! It's the phone! What is it? That granny? She's so old. She's ready to go. - Doctor, please hurry. - Mr. Yaoharu? Yes, yes, please wait! Shun. A call for you. Me? - Hello? - Hurry, it's an emergency. Doctor, you're so difficult... - See you. - That's why I asked you to get a pager. Alright. Got it. Don't worry. Leave it to me. He's saying it again! See? Once he gets involved, he can't stop. He always says "Leave it to me." Mom... Wasn't it your birthday today? Yeah. The toilet paper's run out. Paper? Oh, I'll refill it. Happy Birthday. Thanks... I think you used the wrong character. It's supposed to say "love," right? Yeah, well, it's an abbreviated version. It should really be different but... Oh, abbreviated... - It says lover... - That's how you write it in China? It actually means "wife," even though it says "lover." "Lover..." Huh? It means wife? - Yes, yes. - His lover is your wife? No, it says... Chen's... wife, his wife, Xu Mingfang. I'm waiting for her. In writing "lover" means "wife" I see, Chen's wife is Xu. Yes, yes. In China, a husband and wife have different last names. And with a big population, they only have one kid per family. - You're very knowledgeable. - Well... Yeah, I'm not very versed in Asian knowledge. If it's English, I can do... Huh? Oh, Shinjuku. Taxi. Uh, where is it? Are you here for me? Oh! Xu? - Yes. - Oh! I showed you this earlier! You didn't understand it? Great, I'm relieved. I thought I had missed you. Is this your luggage? Well, glad you made it. I'm that guy from Yaoharu. We've never really fought like that, so I'm a little shocked. But at least Shun's obsessed with Chinese students and not a woman. - Don't worry about the boss... - I suppose. Not even a horse will come near him. Hey, what do you mean by that? Am I less than a horse? - I don't know what to do with you! - I didn't say that! - That's 180 yen. - Thank you for coming! I thought you were a kidnapper. - Huh? What did she say? - Uh... Thank you so much. She says, "thank you so much." Oh, it's no problem. But Chen's pretty late. Maybe the exam's ta king longer... - I've brought some tea. - Oh, Pingping. This is Pingping. She's studying medicine at Chiba University. - Pingping? - Yes. - Female doctor? - Yes. I hear about you all the time, Father. Thank you for always taking good care of my friends. Not at all. Li, how come you never brought such a beautiful friend over? - Pingping is more modest than I am. - Hello! But now, you're our father, so no more modesty! Father? Can't you call me brother instead? "Father" is great! - We all call you our Japanese father! - That's right! I made these dumplings. Very yummy. Please try them! They're not just your average foreign students! Out of millions of people, they're the selected few! When they get back home, they're going to be professors or government officials... They're going to be leaders of a great China! And they're all so polite and modest. Hey, Toru, are you listening? - I'm listening! - You should learn from these people. Modesty, okay? I guess modest people get discounts for vegetables. Stop quibbling! Hey, Dad, you know that clothing store in our neighborhood? Have you noticed that black and white dress they have? - Why would I be checking that out? - I want it. About our store... I know, I know... I'm not that stupid. I won't discount too much. Well, it's about time. - We need you to work hard... - So you want that dress? See, Yumi wants clothes too. We're counting on you, Dad. Yeah, if you don't work hard... We can't even buy clothes. Why don't we all wear matching outfits next time? Don't be silly! That would be embarrassing! Well, hello there! Is this... 200 yen? It's a little pricey. No, it's not. Look, the actual price is 250 yen. Which means it's a 20% discount. And there's 5 of you, so it will be 40 yen each. Yes but... with all the other vegetables and... Okay, let's make it 30 yen per person! So, 150 yen... I can't! That's the base price! Then... 170 yen! No, no. No, no. No janken either! You always do this. I can't. Hello! What great tomatoes! Just a bit less. We're trying to get it for 170 yen. 170 yen? I'll buy as well. Yes, and so will I! Me too! You can have it for 150 yen. Father, thank you! Well, it is the base price. Right, Michi? It's not like we're losing money. Father! I'm no good. - Alright. - No, no. I'm done now. Look! This is really good! Look at that! She's a genius! Hen genius! Closed for New Year's Do Chinese people still eat dogs? - Yes. - Oh, how do you cook them? With dogs, you make them run to get rid of the extra tat. - That's when they're good, right? - Really? You don't eat cats, do you? Cat meat is so sour that you don't even have to put vinegar on it. - Here's yakitori! - That's funny! This is sour! Meow! Snail, Snail You know, this is how I wooed my wife. Stop being silly! Where are your eyeballs? Stick out your horns, stick out your antennae, stick out your head! He has his love antennae out all the time! You mean his love horns! - My turn! - I've been waiting for this! - Your best one! - It's a New Year's song. Thank you, thank you. And you? No? Is that you, Father? - Silly. - That's you, Father! - Is that your mother? - Yes, yes. We look a little alike, huh? Oh, stop looking. No need to see these. He's singing. Doctor, maybe you can sing parts of it. It's going to be lonely, huh? Yeah, Chen and I are returning to China soon. Do your best back home. We really appreciate your help. Thank you for everything. Oh, stop. Don't say that. Keep doing your best. Thank you very much! - That was great! - It's very popular. This is goodbye. I will never forget you, Father. Never. Thank you. Good luck with everything. Thank you for everything. As soon as I get home... I'll write to everyone here. We'll meet again. - China and Japan are neighbors. - Thank you. - It's going to be lonely. - Goodbye. Good bye. Become someone important. - Take care. See you again. - Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. See you again! Don't catch a cold. Zaijian! (Goodbye!) - Goodbye! - Zaijian! - Goodbye! - Zaijian! Zaijian! Hen zaijian! Thank you! Write to us! Zhou. - Thank you, that will be 550 yen! - Mail! Thanks for the trouble! Your change will be 450 yen! - It's from Beijing! - Like always, thank you! Oops, excuse me. Thank you once again! Wow, you guys finished it! Oh, it's from Li! Thanks for the delivery. - Are you a pan-timer? - Yes. I see. Where are you from? - Ibaragi. - Ibaragi? Is Ibaragi very far from Beijing? Ibaragi is in Japan! It's right next door. - Thank you. - Hello! - What's up? - A letter from Li. - Again? - I know! He writes a lot. Oh yeah? Oh, of course! "My friend, Cho, will..." Hey, Yumi, will you turn that down? The TV. - "My friend, Cho, will..." - It's too low! "...be heading over there." "He is from Xi'an and will be studying Business Administration in Tokyo." Yumi, can you check on the bath? Why always me? - You're right there! - What about Tom? "I know it's a lot to ask but please take care of him." "He arrives at Narita Airport on August 10th..." - "...on Japan Airlines..." - Did you feed the dog? - Yup. - "...on Flight 784..." - "...and arrives at 3 pm." - Bath's fine. "I'm sorry to trouble you but could you go and pick him up?" "Thank you so much. Goodbye. - Li." - August 10th? That's tomorrow! - That's too loud. - Oh boy, Li, what were you doing? - Sound's gonna drive me mad. What it the letter came late? We wouldn't be able to pick him up! You're not reading it? It's ridiculous. Life's not that easy. What? He's assuming too much. He writes to me like I'd do anything. - It's the end of the show, isn't it? - Yumi, bath time! C'mon, bath time! - Thank you! - Come get your produce! Yes, 180 yen for the tomatoes! Sorry for the wait! Thank you! - What? - What's up with him? He won't talk. He's trying to decide... whether he should go to the airport or not. Li's friend is supposed to be arriving at 3 pm. - Ah, those Chinese guys! - Yup! - If it's at 3... doesn't he need to leave? - Welcome! Welcome! Get your fruits and vegetables! Ma'am, doesn't he need to go to the airport? They're expecting it, right? Oh? He's disappeared! He's leaving! It's back again! Boss's Chinese disease. Right? I'm a sucker. Hello, Yaoharu's father. My name is Zhang. - Cho? - Yaoharu's father? You're Cho? Oh, I'm glad. - I'm Zhang. - Oh, you read it "Zhang"? - Thank you for coming. - Sorry I'm late! - Xie Xie. (Thank you.) - Sorry for being late. Let's go! Where's your luggage? My luggage! My luggage! It's... gone! - No luggage? You didn't bring any? - Here. It's gone! You're saying it's gone? - Is that it? - Oh! Yes. It was in the way so I moved it there. Is that it? Oh, good. Thank you, ma'am. Xie Xie. Xie Xie! It's my... first time in Japan. You are... so nice! Excuse him... it's a cultural difference. - You must have been surprised. - Yes. Okay, let's go. Let's take that. Sorry to surprise you! Li's talking about me at school? Yes, everyone knows about you. - All the students in Beijing? - Yes. Stop trying to pull a fast one on me! What did you say? Oh, you don't have to learn this kind of talk. - 1,000 yen, please. - Alright. Thank you! What was that? Ah, that was a fee for the highway. They take money. You need money? Just to drive on a road? Yes. It costs money. - Who does it go to? - Hmm... Who does it go to? I guess it goes to the country? I think so... Okay, I'll call you back soon. See you at school. Something's a little off... It's one thing to wonder about the fee but it's another to not pay it back. He didn't even try. A normal person would offer to pay it back, right? He isn't considerate at all. You say that but... What about earlier? "You came trusting me all the way from China and I made you wait an hour!" "I'm sorry!" you said. As soon as you got home, you begged him to come in, "Come, come! Don't be modest!" - I said that? - Yes, you certainly did. - If you say so. - You said it. But I guess... Since you almost didn't go... it must mean you were thinking a little about the store. I didn't want to be sad again. - Huh? - I'm gonna have to say goodbye again, like I did with Li and his friends. A new encounter means another farewell! I didn't want anymore sad farewells, but, oh well. Zhang, you're eventually going back as well, right? - Here. - Yes. Thank you. - Maybe it doesn't go to the country... - Cute, right? If you're ever in trouble, go see Father at Yaoharu. Help? I need help! - Oh, Father! - Don't bother us. - Did you give them money? - No! I told them I'm the one who needs help! - It's cold. Let's go home. - Yes. Thanks for the food! See you all soon. - Take care, Father! - Bye! Oh, thanks. See you tomorrow! - Bye. - Thank you for taking care of Zhang. Father, you're a good man. Everyone thanks you. Oh, there's nothing to thank me for. We're all in a foreign land and we feel a little anxious. Japanese people... talk fast... walk fast... eat fast... - So... - Ah, Japanese people tend to do things quickly. Well, you can always come to me for help. I get mistaken for a Chinese all the time. - Not that it matters. - Thank you! Father... Thank you very much. - Alright, then. - See you! Let me holding your chest Embrace you and listen The song of the ship from my dreams Romance "Pingping-ping, Pingping-chan" - Father! Father! - Okay, okay. - Father! Father! 200 yen? - Yeah, okay, okay. 200 yen? I'd like some too. You're buying too? Hello, Yaoharu Grocers. Yes? Oh, "Father..." Okay. Father, it's for you. Michi, tomatoes. Hello? Oh, Pingping! What happened? I see. Okay, I'll be right there. Wait right there. Michi, she gets the discounts, okay? Thank you very much. - This, please. - Yes. Michi, all this must be really hard on you. Hey, I'd be careful... Of that girl on the phone, Pingping. Did you hear how high pitched his voice was? - She's a female student? - You're over thinking it! Men are men. So are you! - Hey, hey. - Don't "hey, hey" me. But Shun's Chinese disease is pretty serious. Well, Michi, a woman's gotta fight like a woman. You should really... dress up a little. - Nice things? - Yeah. How much are you going to pay? Leave if you're not buying. I'm in trouble. It's all full. This dorm? "They said to look elsewhere. - An apartment? - A public one? - What about rent? - It'll be expensive! Why don't we try asking Father? - Think he'd help? - Yes, he would! - I hope so... - I'll call him! Be quick! Father! - I have a favor to ask. - Ni hao! (Hello!) That's impossible! An apartment for 10,000 yen a month with no money down? They don't exist! Anything will do, right? In China, 10,000 yen is two months worth of wages! That may be true but this is Japan! It's Funabashi. - It's a big city and prices are rising! - Funabashi's rural, right, ma'am? - Is Michi doing well? - Ah, yes. I'm asking you for a personal favor. I get that but... I'm just a middleman. A realtor. Okay? I'm not a landlord. - But you know a bunch of places, right? - Come on. Please. Ni hao! - You're getting bald in the back. - See, you're losing hair. Do something. Get it, landlady? - See, he came all the way from China. - You hear him? But his dorm was full and he has no place to go. And you know, he has to pay for transportation, and a student's gotta eat 3 meals a day. He has to buy books too. And he has to do all that with just 80,000 yen a month! - In an expensive country like ours! - Can you hear? Please understand! Think of it as a Japan-China friendship thing. Grandma, I bet your husband... caused a lot of trouble for Chinese people in the past. - You get it, right? - So Japan-China fr... Can you hear? Uh, maybe I should say it again? Yeah, one more time. So, all the way from China... - Well, I'm relieved. - Glad it worked. - It was the friendship line. - No, it wasn't. She just caved in to all your talking. Whatever. All's well now. No cheaper rooms? - There's no way! - What are you saying? Didn't you hear everything I said to get that price? - It's not expensive! - You're gonna get Father angry. Father, it's too expensive! How annoying! Who do you think I'm doing this for? Okay, I'll pay for the damn rent myself. - Welcome home! - Take care! Yumi! I'm almost done here. Can you tidy up and set the table? Hurry up! Come on. - Wipe with this. - Mom! Yes? - Have you seen my bike? - It's not outside? - That's strange... - It's not there? - It was there a few days ago. - I remember. I haven't used it since. You haven't? Maybe it's at your friend's? - No way. - Maybe you left it there. I'm home. - I left it here. - Welcome home! Michi, where's our personal seal? - Our personal seal? - Yeah. - It's in the front drawer. - The drawer? Hey, Dad, do you know where my bike is? - My bike was out back. - I can't find the seal. Oh, higher up! Dad, don't you know? Well, you don't use it, right? - I thought you didn't need it. - Wait, what? You took it to the dorm? Well, Kin's having a lot of trouble. - You gave it away? - I had to! That's not fair! Oh, stop. You're not in trouble if you don't have a bike! I am! - What are you doing? - Um, well, Ma's wife is coming to Japan... "Guarantor Form"? You know, for a wife of a foreign student to come here... They need someone to vouch for them. - You mean a guarantor. - Well... Hmm, that didn't come out too well. That makes you a guarantor! If this person causes a problem, we end up being responsible! Some people lose everything after signing their personal seal! I can't let you do this. You can't! - Oh, be quiet! - You can't do it! Can't you put yourself in their shoes? It's hard for them. Not knowing anyone they can trust! Us Japanese... we... talk fast... walk fast... and decide things quickly! What does that even mean? There are cultural differences. And they get confused! A grocer shouldn't have to do all this! It doesn't matter who you are! I said you can't! You can't take that! Give me back my bike! - I need my bike! - Why don't you all understand? How dare you grab your parent like that! Go away! - Toru, stop it! - We just bought the bike! Where are you going? - Stop wasting our produce! - Then why don't you start acting like a grocer? You're all godawful! - Good morning. Where's Boss? - Sleeping. Tough times. Then it's us two. Breakfast keeps getting smaller and less tasty. Nothing we can do about it. Mom's been going to the market every morning. Didn't we have bread somewhere? We're a greengrocer, so we probably don't have bread. What's this? A Chinese woman brought it. Didn't Mom tell you? She said, "Thank you, my husband is going to love it." But I guess she wasn't really happy about it. At the end of the day, kids always take the mom's side. Zhou, come on. Horiguchi, wait! Hello! Hello! (Wall: Call Yaoharu if you're in trouble) - Oh, Father! Come on in! - I'm actually here to see Pingping. - Everyone's upstairs right now. - Yeah? Pingping too? - Yes. - Can you call her? - Yes. - Thanks! Pingping! Pingping! - Hello. - Oh, Father! - Pingping, this. - Oh, it's for all that you do! I knew it was you! You're good at drawing! My wife said the panda looks just like me and was delighted! - I'm glad! - The box of vegetables... Oh, where did it go? Thank you, Father! What's going on today? Well, Zhu's wife is ill. - Zhu's wife? - Yes, I'm worried, since we're apart. So, I think I will go back to China. Zhu, you never told me anything! You're really going back? - Yes, she's been sick for 6 months. - She's that sick? Yes. Kidney beans... Why don't you stir-fry them with summer vegetables... And make some soup? - What are you doing? - I need it for highway tolls! - For what? - Zhu's going back to China. - Give it to me! - You take them back and forth but... - we're not a tourism company! - They can't do it by themselves! - Have him go on his own! - What if he gets lost? - He has no money! - Why should I care? - Whatever, I shouldn't have asked. - What are you doing? Welcome! - Yes! I'll pack it right away! - Hey, Boss... You have to do something to him! We can't keep going like this! Do something about your Chinese disease! Getting a dog like this too... Oh, I'm sorry. Tomatoes, right? Yes, green peppers. Okay. And shimeji mushrooms. One bag? Okay. Got it. We may need a little time... Yes, I'll go as soon as I can! Thank you! He took the van, so I can't go out for deliveries! - Hello! - Welcome. - Busy? - The Boss isn't here, so no discounts. The prices are as listed. We're trying to run a business. - Zhu, could you count how much there is? - Yes! Father! What is this? Umm... That's a present for your wife. For my wife? Really? I'm sorry it's not new... - My wife told me to give it to you. - Your wife said that? My wife will be so happy! Thank you! Enough is enough... I can't stand it... Why? You even took my necklace... I mean... You don't wear it, right? Wear it? I don't have the time to! Pawned... It was exchanged for money, huh? Honey, why would you say that? That I don't wear it... When would I wear it? Everyday, I... I go the market for vegetables... "Welcome, welcome..." may... When do I have the time? We're late! Don't worry about the change! - Hurry! - Wait for me! Hurry, hurry! Hey! Sorry, sorry! - What on earth? - Sorry we're late! What are you doing dressed like that? One of our clients died! - Oh, dear! - Throw salt on me! What are you trying to do? Salt, salt, salt. My dick too! I'm barefoot now! He yelled while on his side, "I'm drowning!" If he stood it was only up to here! He said, "Dad, Dad!" But who'd help him in shallow water? - It only went to his knees! - That's right. Hey, did you shave? - Huh? - You shaved. Stop it. That's my natural hair! I bet you're using those chemicals the youngsters use. - Do you want a drink? - No. - What's with you? - Cheer up. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You don't look well. - You laid too many eggs today! - Oops, I forgot salt for this. - Salt? - Oh, I have some! - Really? Yeah, purifying salt from the funeral. What is this? Hey! Doctor! Looking good! When I was young, my mother told me "The ocean is my homeland I was born on the shore And grew up in the ocean My dear ocean! My dear ocean! "The place where I live "Winds blow, waves surge" Following me everywhere My dear ocean! My dear ocean! You are like a mother to me No matter where I go You are always with me Those blooming flowers we saw were hamayu. - Hey, this smells good. - Oh, stop it. I've always wanted to eat one... Yaoharu's watermelon. It's expensive... I always just look at it... You say "expensive" but we sell them cheap, you know! Alright, let's all eat! - Hao chi! - Yummy! Zhang, what's wrong? It smells like home... Xi'an. It makes me remember... But Xi'an's watermelons are better. Xi'an's watermelons are the best. - Oh yeah? - It doesn't even come close. They say Chiba's watermelons are the best. That's wrong... Xi'an's watermelons are much better. That's not fair, Zhang. I understand the pride but... You're taking pride in your hometown too. My hometown is Fukushima! Father... Do you know that watermelon seeds came from China? That doesn't matter! That's important! We all have parents. Because there are parents, there are children. It's very important. I get that but... Then what are you saying? What am I saying? Pretend you're a watermelon and I'm one too. Who decides who's better? - Father, you're missing the point. - No, I'm not! Zhang, for someone who's always calling me father, you don't show much respect. - Father, you're admitting defeat! - What are you saying? In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore Grandpa, watermelon! Letting his own kids call him Grandpa? What is he thinking? He did have them late. How old is his wife? - 28, I think. - 27. That young? I know she looks young... but isn't she 30? No, I heard she's really young. Doctor! Doctor! I brought you some watermelon! Seedless ones, your favorite! Doctor! I'm going to eat them if you don't! What? You're quitting? Tell me why. I won't understand unless you speak up. Well... it's about my wages... I know it's a little late but I said I'd pay you soon. Yumi, can you set the table? I taught you everything you know about vegetables. How do you think you've gotten this far? Traitor. Ungrateful fool. You should learn a thing or two from the Chinese students! Here we go again with China... What? It's true... All you say is China this, China that. You abandon the store and make your wife do all the work. You have no right to talk about our marriage! But Boss.. I feel sorry for your wife. Do you know what the neighbors call you now? - What? - Happy-go-lucky panda. Happy-go-lucky panda? And they say... I'm the bamboo leaves he gobbles. You know, I'm human too. I'm sorry but I'm gonna start working at the supermarket on the other side of town. The owner there has been keeping an eye on me. The missing pay isn't a big deal but... At the end of the day, I want to work for a proper store. I'm still young... I see... I get it. Hey, can you give him what we owe him? We have money for him! - Honey, that's for stocking the store! - Be quiet! - It doesn't have to be now. - Are you fucking with me? We have enough money to pay you! Don't belittle me! You fucker! If you have money to give to Chinese people, why don't you... Oh! It's you, Take! - Is this the home of Shunzo Horikoshi? - Yes. I actually just started working at the tax office. Tax office? Funabashi Tax Office. We found that you haven't paid your taxes so we're here to confiscate some of your valuables. Confiscate? Well... you haven't paid your taxes, so... we came to confiscate some of your things... We ask for your cooperation. Excuse me... This is about 8,000 yen, right? It's a little old, so... maybe 5,000 yen... 5,000? Well, that fridge is worth a lot! - Yes, this is industrial-sized. - But this fridge is for business! Without this, we can't work! Take! We can't pay our taxes without it! We're not saying you can't use it! But... well... The office is so busy... and... yes... - we have to do our jobs as well. - Here's your mail, ma'am! - Yes, he's right. - Coming... How about that TV? - What year was it made? - Seventy... - How's the image? - It turns on! This is from the tax office... Tax office? This is the notice of seizure. - Notice? - Yes. Mailman! We sent this out 10 days go! Please tell the postmaster about this! Take... What's going to happen to us? Excuse me. Can you please accept and read this notice? You'll understand everything. How about that dish cabinet over there? That one. Not so close to the TV. If not 1 million, can I take out 500,000? At least let me pay the taxes. We have children too... Come on. We go way back! That's true but... I know your store isn't doing too well. We'll build it back up. It will be fine! - Come on. It's easy. - I get it but... We're running a business too. I know but... I'm asking you for a favor. Right? - That's why I'm coming to you! - But I hear your license was revoked... That has nothing to do with this. I'm telling you I can pay it back. But without your license, how will you do that? You can't even sell anything! Your wretched personality hasn't changed. - What did you say? - Same haircut too. Stop getting personal about it! - You fucker! - Help! Someone! I still come even though it's become so quiet here. I mean, we go way back. Thank you. Everyone's going to the supermarket just because business has gotten a bit slow here. I can't be so heartless! Yaoharu is the best place to buy vegetables. - Hello! - Welcome. Oh! How much? Onions and potatoes... It comes out to 110 yen... 100 yen's fine. Oh, dear. I'm sorry! Are you sure? - Well, Ms. Ito, I'll take this. - Are you sure? Thank you very much. - Excuse me. What is this? - Enoki mushrooms. Are they Chinese? Good luck with everything! Thanks again! Is that... Father's sweater? Yes! It looks good on you! He came for a loan When I said no, he suddenly... This is property damage. I don't want to make matters any worse than they already are. - I suppose it's just one do". - No loans for him though. My son liked this thing. This is so pathetic! And cruel! How dare they. Don't look at me like that... like you represent all of Japan. You won't listen to me. I told you! You're just talking to yourself. I'm not telling you to stop seeing them! Your eyes are saying it! "Why did you sell that truck?" "How did the money..." "Did you give it to them?" Your eyes say that! - What? - I'm... - You're leaving me? Leave if you want! Go wherever you want! What are you two doing? Don't leave your manga here! Clean up! Dad! Dad! Honey? - Don't move him. - His heart... seems to have weakened a bit but it's just from stress. He'll be okay. Let him stay here and rest. He'll be fine. Will he be okay? This is what's called a Chinese disease kranke. "Kranke?" It means "patient" in German. You guys should go now. - You'll be late. - Yes, don't be late for school. He's fine! - See you. - Take care. Don't you worry. Mom... What about the store? I can skip school and help out. Don't worry about that. - Mother! Mother! - What are you all doing here? Father's doing fine! He's fine. He's alive. He's doing very well. We heard it from your neighbor! We wondered what was wrong because the store was closed. - Mother, what will you do with the store? - We can help! - Yes! Yes! - Don't worry! Don't worry! Go to school! - Don't worry about the store. - Really? It will be fine. Please go to school. - Thank you, everyone. - We'll come back! Yes, thank you. You should all go to school now. It's fine! Take care, everyone. Mom, Dad's really popular! Stupid, you don't call this popular! - Then what? More like... well liked. Right, Mom? Take care. - Thank you. - We're off then. We'll be back! Off you go! Mother! Good morning! - Good morning. - Let's get going! Okay, let's go. Please, go ahead. Zhang, stop it! Yang, let me off! Thank you for giving us a discount all the time. It must be difficult for you! Since you can't do the auction... It's tough for a grocer to not have a license. Oh! Those are fragile so put them up top! - Work that muscle! - Great job! Hey! Go to the side! The side! To the left! Yang, to the left! Hello! I'm from Yaoharu! - Oh, thank you. - Thank you! It's been a while, Ryo! - When did you get back? - Yesterday. - How much? - It's 1,780 yen. Here's 2,000 yen. Here's 2,000 yen. - Thank you. - The bananas look great! - Thank you. - The bananas look great! I heard the boss is in the hospital. Yes. Apparently his heart's weakened a bit. That's rough. I'll be around for a few days. Let me know if I can help. Thanks you very much! - Well then. - Take care! Thank you so much! Granny, looks like it's gonna rain. Granny! I'm looking forward to your cabbage dish! I know! Wow, it's really pouring! It was sunny earlier! - It's no good! - Take an umbrella! These guys are so lively! - Thanks so much. - Want my husband's rain boots? Oh, don't worry about it! Are you sure? You just took those from the store. Took? I bought them all! It's expensive stuff! By the way... When those Chinese students return, they'll become professors... government officials... or even leaders, right? Shun, this is true Japan-China friendship! What's wrong? - Can you call Toyoken? - The realtor? Oh, I forgot. - Tera is in the hospital. - Tera? It was cancer, after all. - Oh no. - He doesn't know it yet. Toyoken? - What do you need from Toyoken? - He wants to sell the store? He told me to keep it from you... But I couldn't do that! Shun... Everyone's working so hard to keep the store going and he's trying to sell it... Your husband's stupid! Father's not stupid! Sorry. " It's a friendly expression.. Sorry about that. - Did you make those dumplings? - Please have some! They're delicious! These students did... - I see. - I made the dumplings. - Oh yeah? - They're very good. - Oh, thank you. - Please. I'll have one then! This is 150 yen! 30 yen each! Of course! I must pay! 150 yen, you said? I don't have change, so... Is this okay? - Please don't... eat up. - Yeah? Wait a second... I think I have change. I hear it! - Japanese money. How much? - 150 yen. 150 yen, alright. Thank you very much! - Please eat. - Wishing you success! Xie Xie, xie Xie! Welcome! Come on up! Please, lie down. Oh, I'm fine now. No! Father, I'm a doctor. You have to listen to me. Oh, that's right. You are. But this is such a great painting! You're really talented. When I think of the Great Wall of China, I find strength... I feel the power of the people who protected China. So... when I... need strength... I look at this painting. I start to feel courage inside. Hey, guys, listen... I don't think we should let Father sell Yaoharu.. Think about it... YaoHaru is our store too. We're students but... We have to do something to... protect YaoHaru. If we let YaoHaru end... "we're also ending our own future. Now is the time for us to act! For Father! And for ourselves! I agree! I agree!

It's just the title of the porn. - It's in the way. Can you take it home? - Alright. By the way, did you find a buyer? - Buyer? - Isn't that why Toyoken came? He said there was one guy that may be interested. I'm gonna go make a call. What's that song? What song? Oh, just some song.. Honey, you're not cured yet!

Now that I think about it... There were times when he would stare at me with these really lonely eyes. Don't flatter yourself! You probably do get a feeling when you're about to die. - Gravestones selling well? - Well... In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore Our lives are so ephemeral. In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore. In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore Shun! Here's the photo you asked me for! In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore In the morning as I wandered about along the seashore I remembered things from the old times Oh, of Zhang. I remembered things from the old times I remembered things from the old times Sorry for the trouble. I remembered things from the old times I remembered things from the old times Oh, it came out great! I remembered things from the old times I remembered things from the old times How long's it been?

There's lots of cars, so be careful. We're the guarantor for them. But you know... Recently, I've been wondering how I became this way. What are you saying? I mean... they go back and become really important people... yet they call me Father! All I did was give discounts on bok choy! It's silly. I wonder, who am I? What am I doing? I feel a responsibility now... it weighs down on me. Oh! Yasu! Hi. What are you doing here? - Umm... I just saw this. - Last night's paper. Well, Boss... You've become front page material! - You better not be asking to come back. - Of course not! I mean, they pay me and treat me better at the supermarket. Well, of course I can't compete with a supermarket! It's the way of the world. It's not just that. After all, you have the incurable Chinese disease. - Ha! He got you... - When you say things like that... - Welcome. - What's this? Well... - Well, what? - She's tall, right? There are people who call Shunzo odd... but he's just doing what's right. These days it's the rest of society that's odd. - Honey! Honey! Honey! - I'm home! A call from I.! - Is he in Japan? - No, no, from China! Long-distance! Hello? Li? Been a while! Are you well? I'm good! What's going on? We're doing a reunion in Beijing soon. We want you to come. - Want me to come to Beijing? - Everyone who went to Japan will come. We want to invite you and Mother!

He rode an airplane on the root of the department store! I don't like to tell people but it's Taiwan... he rode an airplane on the root of the department store! He rode an airplane on the root of the department store! Oh yeah! - I've only been to Okinawa. - Okinawa, huh? Go to Taiwan. Shut it! Sister, it's been so long! Camera. For you. For me? Oh, wow! For China! You kids, be more quiet! Hey, at least say thanks! I just did! I did too! Shall I give it back? What about the store? - Yeah, the store. - Uh... the store... - You'll have to take a break. - That's true. Listen to me! We're going to be helping out with the store! It's true... Only while he's away though! I have permission from the supermarket. No need for it to stop there! Dad, Dad! Can't me and Yumi go too? - You have schoolwork! - Come on! I need a break! But Shun, you did good. You're the first in our neighborhood to make it in the papers! That's true. And Michi too! Yes! Michi did great! - Excuse me, here's your food. - Looks delicious! Thank you. What's wrong? I can't stop shaking... I mean... We're up in the sky now, right? - Be quiet! - I can't help it! Such a happy couple! We haven't traveled by ourselves since our honeymoon! It's like all the holidays came at once! June, 1989, Beijing They got us a really nice room. I'm so glad they're all doing well. Look! The evening view is beautiful! It feels strange being in China now. Yes. As you may already know, we are not in China. We actually couldn't make it to China. We're in a movie studio in Tokyo. A place where dreams are created on film. I would now like to tell you about our dream - our trip to China. - But I'm glad. - Yes, glad to be here. - Not that. - Huh? I'm glad I married you, honey. What's gotten into you? It was really hard at times and I was sometimes jealous of the other women but... - Our lives have just begun. - That's true! It's true but... Here, this is a match from Beijing. That evening, everyone gathered at the reunion. This scene was actually shot in Japan back in May. We didn't think much of it then, but now, I think of it as an important night. When I was young, my mother told me "The ocean is my homeland I was born on the shore And grew up in the ocean My dear ocean! My dear ocean! Thank you. My dear ocean! My dear ocean! Thank you. The place where I live "The place where I live "Winds blow, waves surge" Following me everywhere Father! It's been so long! Mother, are you well? I know you're far, so I didn't think I'd see you! - Thank you. - I came all the way to Beijing. - It took 75 hours! - 75 hours? That's 3 days! - For you! - Thank you! Thank you very much! My dear ocean! My dear ocean! You are like a mother to me No matter where I go You are always with me Is Zhang not here yet? And Pingping? You are always with me Is Zhang not here yet? And Pingping? I know they got married. I was looking forward to seeing them. They'll definitely come. Any minute now. I hope so. Thank you! Thank you very much! Oh, I can't! Father! Speech! Father! Speech! Oh, I can't! Um... thank you for inviting us to such... um... a wonderful party. There's you... and us... and in between... How can I say this? I don't really know but... Thank you very much for today. Really, thank you so much. People are... uh... they can look happy... or they can look unhappy... or look rich... or look poor... But inside each and every one of us... I think there's something that never changes... And I think that something is what keeps us all together... And by getting to know all of you... we learned about this... I can't really say what that "something" is exactly... It's something that has... even after you left Japan... something that has remained in our hearts... And that has... made us incredibly happy. Whenever we thought of you... We became very happy. And now... I no longer have to imagine it because everyone's here in front of us! From the bottom of my heart... Thank you so much for coming to Japan... to Yaoharu... Father feels the same way! Right, Father? And also... Father is always saying he's an idiot but... the true idiot is actually me. When everybody came for the discounts... - Don't talk about that! - I was worried about sales. You said enough already. Oh, but come on! Everyone, please relax. It's become so quiet! We should be more lively! Thank you everyone. In all sincerity. Thank you so much! Cheers! Cheers! With all our might! For our pride! For our pride! However, we were never able to reunite like this in Beijing... However, we were never able to reunite like this in Beijing... And for our homeland! With all our might! The real-life YaoHaru couple went to Beijing In the summer of 1987. Two years ago. We sweat a lot! In the summer of 1987. Two years ago. For our pride! For our pride! But our film was never able to catch up with real life. Reality is sometimes more powerful than movies. And for our homeland! There was one place I really wanted to visit during my trip to China. That's the Great Wall of China. There, I wanted to feel the strength of the Chinese people. I wanted to feel the energy that would help me get up when I was down. Zhang and Pingping didn't make it. - They must be busy! - Yeah. What is it? My father... I was going to tell everyone about my father who died in China... but I couldn't. My father liked that song. Maybe it's a song we shouldn't sing anymore. I'm a happy person. Right? You are. So perhaps you're unhappy. Why's that? You said... I was selfish. If I'm selfishly happy, then it may be the opposite for you. That's weird. - Is it? - Yes. - Hen weird? - Yep. You really are selfish. So don't come to selfish conclusions. If you're happy... Of course I'm happy too! You've become so chatty! Idiot. The next day we went to visit Zhu's sick wife. There, we came across something unexpected. "The necklace you bestowed... It gives me hope. Thank you. I'm so glad you like it. It looks great on you. Our journey in China concludes here. It was a trip full of happiness and sadness. Like our trip to China, we'll return in a mock-airplane used for crew training at Haneda airport. Of course, it doesn't actually fly. But at the end of the trip... There was an event so joyous, it would have made anyone fly high in the sky. Right before departure... Zhang and Pingping arrived all the way from Xi'an. Excuse me. "Congratulations on the wedding!" I said what I had wanted to say. Zhang had a present for us tightly gripped to his chest. What do you think it was? A watermelon. The watermelon he was proud of. From his hometown of Xi'an. We immediately decided to find out who won. To settle whether Xi'an's watermelon or Chiba's watermelon was better... It was delicious... really delicious. I had never eaten a watermelon so good... It was really... hao chi. Hen hao chi. - Hen hao chi. - That's right. Hen hao chi. - It's time. Sorry for the wait. - We're coming. - Mr. Bengal! - Yes? This... Oh, I'm sorry! Please hold this. Your name's on the front. There are some things inside. Li handed me this envelope as I was walking through the departure gate. "What's this?" I asked as I began opening it, "Open it in the airplane," he replied, "everyone's feelings are inside." - Let's begin. - Yes. - Hello! - Hello! We're here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Ms. Motai, to the window-side, please. Okay, coming through. - Excuse me! - Fix the tie, please. The tie's loose. All good! Mr. Bengal, can you move back a little? Quiet on Set! Ready, everyone? Clapper! Scene 137. On board flying airplane. Cut 1. Track 1. Ready... Action! Mr. Shunzo Horikoshi. It's money. Looking at the money, you're probably angry, Father... In China, there is a saying: when given a single drop of kindness from a stranger, you must always repay with a bubbling fountain. When we were in Japan we knew that Yaoharu wasn't doing well. "This money is our modest fountain. Please put it toward rebuilding the store. And please continue the Japan-China friendship, as well as being a father for Chinese students in Japan. We gained so much from you, Father. You helped us. Our sincerest gratitude. But what made us most happy... were the kind hearts possessed by both you and Mother. We see you as representatives of Japan and we thank you. Xie Xie. Xie Xie. There's 80,000 yen! 80,000 is like... a whole year's wonh of wages for them! "Open it on the plane..." I didn't think they would do something like this! How selfish! They're the same as you, Honey. Don't be silly! What do we do with so much money? I'm not going to accept it. - I know. - What do you mean, "I know"? It's not like we can give it back! They all did... this... they'll be offended! We'll do janken. When we see them again, we'll play janken. - Janken? - Yeah. I see... Janken... In order to be happy, we do not need to be rich. We should change the way we think about life. I see. That's it. - One of these. - Okay. The half-piece? - Two ramen noodles too. - Okay. So, two ramens are 140 and this is 50, so 190 yen total! Yes, thank you! - Did you move here recently? - Yes, yesterday. - By the complex? - Yes. Well, we're neighbors now, so we hope to see you often. - We hope so too. - Thank you! Shall we cut these? What's up? - Yasu, you're really attractive. - Huh? Way more attractive than at the supermarket. But that won't matter it we can't eat. - You think so? - Yes, of course! - Can you even get up early? - I can! - You won't be able to dress up. - Don't care! You'll be full of blisters. - Not a problem! - Yeah? Really? Come on up! Yaoharu's vegetables are cheap and fresh! The best in all of Japan! Come on up! Come on up! They're cheap! Yaoharu's vegetables! Just felt like it.. What? Nothing. What is it? Well then!

They sang with all their might, reminiscing about their friends, who had returned to their homeland far away. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi We dedicate this film to all our young Chinese friends.
