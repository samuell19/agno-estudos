Dharma, you?! Don't you like it, DCP Khan? Have you ever seen so much money? Dharma, I'm warning you.. Khan, I very well know that you're very hot-blooded. But don't let this heat pass on to your uniform. At least let the uniform be cold. Because only money can provide respite from this heat. Dharma, traitors like you can't,.. ..pay the price for my honesty. What is it, father? - Who is he? Dear! Take Sikander inside. - C'mon, dear. Sweet child! - Talk business! The dialogues that you uttered just now.. ..are better suited for the movies or the theatre, not for real life. The reality is that I've struck a deal with the constables.. ..whose testimonies acts as your strength. I've come to shut you up, now. Ladies and gentlemen, today's function.. Pass please! Is for those brave and honourable, patriotic police officers.. ..who proved to be a terror to the criminals. - Press. Go upstairs. Or on their death cloth. In the list of officers who are going to be awarded.. ..the first name is DCP AA Khan. Daddy! DCP Khan, please come to the stage. Now, I would request the governor to award the medal to DCP Khan. No! Daddy! Mummy! - Son! No! Control yourself, dear. ..I've seen enough tears to fill up the ocean. But even this ocean of tears couldn't have revived a dead man. Wipe it. Wipe off your tears. Uncle, my parents have left me. It's all fate's doing, dear. A man is made of this earth, lives by it.. He fights for it and ultimately become a part of it. Look at these piles of earth! So many of them lie beneath it. But they'll rise one day. Surely they will rise. Not when we want them to, but when the almighty lord wants them to. On the fateful day, when the world.. ..comes to an end, they'll all rise up. But not before that. Not before that. Go home, dear. - Uncle, father is no longer alive. I'm totally alone nowl.. It's a selfish world, dear. No one belongs to the other. Even I was rendered homeless at the age of 12. I, too, wept beside my parents'grave. Learn to live alone, now. Learn to fight your circumstances. Learn to steal your dreams from destiny. Brother! - Father! Brother! - Father! "In the ocean.. - There's music." "The light.. - Is a part of the sun." "The thread.. - Bonds with the kite." "The flowers.. - are in love with colours!" "There's music in the ocean." "The light is a part of the sun." "There's music in the ocean."

Rajni, we've to look at uniformed men all our lives. That of a custom officer and a police officer. Isn't it? Sister-in-law, the customs and the police are hand in glove. An unbreakable bond! Isn't it, brother? Absolutely correct! Bless you! Hey man! Even I didn't get so emotional.. ..when I offered my sister's hand to you. Then why are you getting so emotional today? They've just got engaged today. They're yet to get married. Yes, pal. When we have something, we don't value it. But we miss it when it's no longer with us. I'm in a good mood today, ask me why. - Why? Till yesterday, I was your brother-in-law. Shake hands for that! Hello, Bharat Srivastav here. Greetings! - Your introduction? I'm an old resident of this city. Old resident? - Yes. Sir, you must've heard about the Shikari brothers. The late Dharma Shikari. Teja Shikari, and I'm Pappu Shikari. Is that all? - No, there are two more. Tinu Shikari, and the youngest, Chinu Shikari. Really? Mr. Shikari, why are you beating around the bush? Come to the topic. - That's the reason I called. Now listen to one important thing. Mr. Bharat Srivastav,.. ..you've been appointed as the new senior custom officer for this city. And the Shikaris'have lived for long in this city. Do you get me? - Yes, I do. Whenever I'm transferred to a new city,.. ..I always come across someone like you. By the way even I like oldies. Tell me, what can I do? - I'll tell you right away. Listen carefully, Bharat. Come to the swimming pool at hotel Horizon at 5pm tomorrow. We'll discuss everything there. Greetings! Giving yourself a tan? The Shikari brothers always find their prey! Sir, just like how the police and the customs identify criminals. Similarly, we shady men easily identify people like you. You're very smart. Else in the open.. There's fun in it. What's there to fear in business? Tell me, when and where will the goods be imported? Tomorrow night at Majgaon dock. The place you're in-charge of. And when will my goods be delivered to me? Sir, the Shikari brothers are veterans in this business. We export first and then import. I mean, this bag full of currency. 2.5 million! No dues! We fully trust officers like you. Rajni, I accepted you. I agreed to an alliance with this family only because of your values. But the honesty has evaporated now! Bharat Srivastav, the son of DIG Amarnath Srivastav,.. ..senior custom officer. I'd heard so much about him. But what I've seen today falsifies all that.. Your brother's here! He's even holding the bag. Despite being in uniform. What happened, Gautam? What are you trying to say? Look into your soul, you'll get the answer. You're a policeman and I'm a custom officer. We shouldn't meddle in each other's duties. Why shouldn't we? Even I'm a part of the Srivastav family now. And I don't want someone to sling mud.. ..on your uniform and on mine, too. No, Gautam. Nothing of that sort will happen. You still haven't understood me well. What's left to understand, brother? Gautam! What's wrong with you? Why are you making a mountain out of a mole hill? This isn't a small issue, sister-in-law. I do! I know everything. It's his habit. - What?! It's his habit to betray his duty and his country? This means that the people who dwell.. ..this house are used to cheating for their daily bread. Dishonesty is the virtue of this family! Gautam, will you listen to us before you speak? My judgement has gone wrong for the first time. But it's good! It's good that god opened my eyes before things could progress. Be careful! Slowly! - Don't worry! Greetings, sir! I'm telling you the truth. We, Shikari brothers, have been in this business for years. But for the first time in our lives have I met such a daring officer. In uniform! This liquor! And you're openly being dishonest, even in the docks. I'm impressed, sir! Guess we'll gel well! Cheers! Mr. Pappu Shikari, it's important to share a good rapport,.. ..whether it's friendship or enmity. No! Don't even talk about enmity! No! May no one cast an evil eye on our friendship! Have a look! What's this? It's a govt. Receipt for Rs. 2. 5 million. ..that you gave me. But I had given it to you,.. ..why did you deposit it in the govt. Treasury? Because it's my style, Pappu Shikari. I gulp down old wine like you. Do you think that we govt. Servants are so easy to fool? I'll teach such a lesson to the likes of you.. The game's up for Shikari brothers! You're under arrest! Get up! Mr. Pappu, you!? - Yes, me. Me! Tell this man! Make him understand! Make him understand! He doesn't realise who he is messing with! Tell him who I am. What will he tell me? He stinks of dishonesty. Tavde, lock him up. But sir, what do I write in the report? Peep outside, a truckload of cocaine is the evidence of his crime. And Mr. Tavde, henceforth, remember.. ..that this is the customs office, not a canteen. If you want to eat, go to the canteen downstairs. Henceforth, the rules and regulations laid down by the govt.. ..will be applicable to this department. Remember! And the govt. Has also laid down the ruled that.. ..one should come drunk to the office, isn't it? You smell of liquor! Had you understood, then you would've been in my place. Now sit down! Welcome, Inspector Gautam Yadav. So you've followed me here. Did you see the truth behind this uniform? And the fate of that bag of money? He's the one who gave me that bag of money. It's my style to enjoy my hunt! Brother, I'm sorry. Never again make the mistake of misunderstanding a genuine person. Remember that what you see and what you hear isn't always true. Reaffirm your faith in me. ..and honesty is in our blood. Bharat Srivastav! That bastard has cheated on us! I won't spare him! We'll finish him off! - No, brother. Killing him will aggravate the issue further. Ansubhai, Pappu should be released at any cost. Lawyer, sting the law. Because only venom can neutralise venom. Got it. Complicate the case so much that the law is confused.. ..and our brother is allowed to go scot-free. He'll be released, Chinu. Be patient! When all other judicial tricks fail,.. ..then Ansubhai uses his trump card,.. ..it's called Sikander. Look Salim.. My name is Sikander Khan and people lovingly call me Sikander-the cure. Because I've a cure for all ailments. It's my profession to falsify the truth and vice versa. Every criminal confesses his crime to me. Tell me what you've done. Rape! How old was the girl? Was she married? She was unmarried. Around 17 years of age. 17 spells danger! You're going to get a 7 year term. Why would I come to you if I wanted to serve a term? - Shut up! Uncle Abdul has gone to the market. Tell me everything before he returns. Where and at what time did the rape happen? Ridiculous! You're questioning me like a lawyer! Then answer all my questions truthfully. I committed the rape in the Kherwadi slums at 10.30pm. What's the girl's name? - Champa! That's like it! You raped a 17 year old girl named Champa.. How many times are you going to ask that? Yes, I did! I'm asking you so that I record all the facts and the law punishes you. What do you mean? Salim, you must've heard that when the rat drowns,.. ..the ship is the first to flee. You're wrong! When the ship drowns, the rats are the first to flee. Yes! You understood, didn't you? Enough! You're going to meet the same fate as the rat. Sikander! What are you trying to say? Salim, Sikander-the cure does give false testimonies. But even I have my principles. I respect women. And you've dishonoured an innocent woman. I'll testify the truth against you, using this. And have you punished! - I'm Salim Surti. I'm Satanic in appearance and evil in my deeds. That's why people lovingly call me, Salim-the evil. ..but when Salim-the evil bites, even God can't save him. Give me the tape! C'mon! How dare you mess with Sikander! Inspector, here's your criminal. And here's his confession. Sikander will testify against him in court. Your honour, I won't say anything further. Because the officers of the law have made a joke of the law. They're so inebriated by their power that.. ..they wrongly book a case against a noble person. Objection, your honour! - Mr. Pandit, let him continue. Mr. Shah, you may proceed. The truth is always bitter. Now, I'll produce a witness who'll clear the facts. Produce Sikander in court! Attention Sikander! Aunty, are you alright? Will your leg be cured? What did the doctor say? The doctor says that I'll be crippled. Don't worry, you'll start walking. Don't worry! Order! If you've anything to say, then come to the witness box. What do I say and what shouldn't I say? Anyway, I'll speak nothing but the truth. It's become difficult for the poor to survive, these days. She's my aunt. She brought me up. That day, this custom officer bumped her off. What are you trying to say? What will he say? Ask me the truth. ..was distributing medicines in our locality, along with Sikander. Suddenly, this white-uniformed officer sped into our locality. He banged against his car in a drunken stupor. And bumped me off in the process. He bumped me off, Milord! I was saved by god's grace! If you've anything to say, then come to the witness box. Milord, if I fall on my way to the witness box,.. ..then I'll gain land up in a hospital bed. I have erratic BP and what do they say in English.. Diatebege! - Not diatebege! Diabetes! Diabetes! - Yes, that's the one. Milord, did you understand? Yes, he did. Order! Your honour, you know the truth behind this case. When plague had happened in the city the last time.. ..then to supply medicines in their area.. ..Mr Pappu Shikari and Mr Sikander.. Who's also the social worker for that.. ..locality, were going by their car.. ..when R.S. Shrivastav, drenched in alocohol got his car.. ..and slammed into his car. And then it turned into a case of cocaine smuggling. Your honour, it's a lie! A blatant lie! Your honour, in order to prove the truth,.. ..I would like to interrogate Mr. Tavde as well. Go ahead! Mr. Tavde, was Mr. Bharat Srivastav drunk on the day.. ..he arrested Mr. Pappu Shikari? Yes, sir. When I asked him about it.. ..then he abused me in the presence of other officers. Point to be noted, your honour. Before noting down that point, please note this down, Milord. Firstly, I was drunk but I didn't drive. Secondly, I didn't meet with any accident. This whole thing is a hoax! Milord, if you have any doubt,.. ..then open that box of cocaine in the court. The truth will be established. Permission granted! Open one of the boxes of cocaine that were confiscated. Open it! Did you see, Milord? The truth is for everyone to see! - This is not the truth, Milord! The truth is that I pretended to help Pappu Shikari and trapped him. And today, this case has been proved false.. And it's all happening in your presence, Milord. Do you want every honest officer to lose his faith on the law? Mr. Bharat, you're insulting the judiciary. Yes, I'm insulting the judiciary. I'm insulting the judiciary.. ..that pardons the criminal on the basis of false witnesses. I'm insulting the judiciary.. The judiciary that can falsify the law. Mr. Srivastav, control your self! - Control your self!? Had I not controlled myself. Had I not been bound by my duty and virtues,.. ..I would've strangled such traitors and such lawyers. Mr. Bharat Srivastav, this is the limit. My patience has reached its limit, sir! All you can do is pass a sentence. Go ahead! Pass the sentence! So that this hoax comes to an end. Go ahead! Order! In lieu of the circumstances,.. ..statements and the testimonies of Sikander and Halima,.. ..this court declares Pappu Shikari to be innocent. And warns custom officer Bharat Srivastav,.. ..not to misuse his powers.. ..else the law will have to deal with him strictly. I'm impressed by your false testimony! But I still can't understand.. ..how you switched the box of cocaine for that of medicines. Did I understand how you manage to speak such good Hindi in court? No! Similarly, you won't be able to understand this. It's very simple! Now stop laughing and give me the money. Here it is, pal! - Thank you! Were you trying to keep it all for yourself? Sikander! - It's between you and your aunt. Goodbye! - Go, go. Give me the money,.. ..I've to go. - Wait! Be patient! Here's 5000! - Ok. Give me that. - What for? That's the taxi fare. Will I walk all the way? Heena has gone to her friends wedding to apply henna.. ..If she comes back before me, then she'll create chaos. Give me that as well. - What for? The rent for the crutches, dear. Listen, aunt. - What? Don't meet me again. Bye! - Ok! Bye! Heena, apply so much henna that not her hand.. ..but even her future is coloured. I heard that even Sangita's would-be is a colourful personality. Assume that Sangita's life is going to be flooded with colours. Reeta, applying henna is my profession.. ..but I've never felt so happy doing it, as today. Why won't you? You're her close friend. Heena! But tell me something. You apply henna on every bride in the world. - Yes. When do you intend to get married? Aunty, she has already chosen her prince charming. Really? - Yes, aunty. She's telling the truth. Who are you? How can you just barge in? Aunty, We're the groom's friend. He has arrived with pomp. Alas! The times are so bad! Even the groom hasn't seen the bride yet,.. ..but you all have come to meet her. Let him meet her! Times have changed now. I hadn't even seen your face before our marriage. But when I saw you for the first time.. ..on our wedding night, I got frightened. Since then, I haven't been able to utter a word. But you have now! You were silent as long as you were alone. But you started acting manly the moment you saw a few men. Aunty! I know all of Arun's friends. But I don't know any of these guys. - Heena, why are you lying? Have you forgotten that the other day,.. ..you, me, Sangita and Arun had gone out for dinner. What? - I had paid the bill. Rs.525.99p. You only paid the 99p. Uncle, see how quiet she is now. These damsels are good at acting. You're right, son. So you've started singing their tune. Let alone the tune, we'll even match steps. We'll make merry! C'mon kids! Start! - C'mon, brothers! "These damsels are good at acting." "These damsels are good at acting." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "These damsels are good at acting." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "These crazy men pretend so much." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "They're annoyed at times. They're friendly at times." "Silent at times, smiling otherwise." "Staying aloof at times, getting close otherwise." "Struck by sorrow at times. Being pompous at times." "They loot us with their grace." "They kill us with their enchanting eyes." "They lure us with promises of love." "How does one escape their cheesy words?" "They never miss their targets." "These damsels are good at acting." "These damsels are good at acting." "They drive us crazy and ruin us." "They steal our hearts and make us grieve." "It's the same story with every man." "They've looted us in the name of love!" "These fluttering eyelids spell doom." "They've turned us away from society." "These men have shattered our hearts." "They're here, one day and there, on the next. "They've a new address everyday." "These damsels are good at acting." "These damsels are good at acting." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "These crazy men pretend so much." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." "Even god can't understand them, we're mere humans." You came there as well. What was the need for you to come there? What happened? What made you stop? That speed-breaker! - What? Look there! Heighten her hopes further, scoundrel. Mislead my innocent niece. But remember something.. Aunt, don't call me a scoundrel. If I lose my cool then.. Scoundrel, I lose my cool.. ..when I see Heena with you. I'm still repenting for accepting your offer due to my poverty. But remember something, Sikander. You'll not marry Heena, as long as I'm alive. Never! Why? What's wrong with me? Wrong? What do I say? There's nothing right about you. Aunt, enough of your nonsense. Enough! Sikander might be bad in the eyes of the world. He's the king of love for her! She's the reason for my existence. But where will you keep her after marriage? In that graveyard? Will she roam around in this coffin-like bike of yours? What will you feed her? Stale burgers? And where will your children study? In a govt. School? Answer me! Why don't you answer me? Sikander, Heena is a piece of my heart. I'll marry her off into a rich family.. Listen, you're not supposed to meet this scoundrel again. No! - Get up! Go inside! I said, get up! Go inside! - Aunt, listen to me. My name's Sikander. I'll marry no one except Heena. I'll change my fate such that, this world will know me as the king of his fate. King of his fate! Heena, don't misunderstand me. I've put up this act to bring Sikander on the right path. Yes, dear. That scoundrel used to laugh off everything. But today, I've hurt him such that.. Aunt! - Yes, dear. Do you think your aunty is so heartless as to separate two lovers? I've to even fulfill the promise made to your deceased mother. I'll have you married to Sikander. Here's your stop. Rs.10! Everybody comes to live in the graveyard after death.. ..but this Sikander lives here, despite being fully alive. Sikander-the cure! People go to the clinic for a cure.. ..but I'm forced to come to the graveyard, to you. Nobody can cure me other than you. What is it, Chandu Tolani? You've come to the graveyard so early in the morning. Are you in the mood to die? I haven't lived to my satisfaction yet.. ..and you're already talking of death. Everyone here's dead, who's going to listen to me? I've come to hire you to kill somebody. Contract killing! You're a derby broker, when did you turn into a gangster? One gets kicked even in a horse race. That fellow has taken my money. Who? - Rinse your mouth first. Why are you blabbering? - Just tell me. I listen with my ears, not my mouth. Sikander, that thug from Mahakali, Kaalu.. What happened? Has Kaalu's name scared you? Not so. Tell me, what's the matter? It's very clear. He had bet money during the last derby,.. ..that too, over the telephone. He lost the money. When I ask him for the money, he shows me long knives. Pictures of various pistols! Last time, he showed me an AK-97! - Not 97! AK-47! It's all the same. It does fire! Sikander, I'm afraid of weapons. But I need my money. That's why I've come to you. It's 40,000 rupees. Where are you going? Come back. Why are we sitting here? The grave's open. Chandu, everybody has to come here after death. - That's true. Chandu, making Kaalu pay up is as tough as snatching a lion's hunt. For this job I'll take fifty percent! But it's fine, at least I'll recover half the money. And it should cost him Rs.50,000 at least! I'll assume that my money has been recovered. Ok! Your job will be done. - Ok. Advance? - What? Advance! Hurry up! I keep it here, these days. Too many pickpockets around. You'll get the rest of the money after the job's done. Ok. Do one thing. Get lost, your job will be done. Ok. - Go away! I'm going! - Get lost! God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. God, shower your mercy upon your faithful. Sikander, it seems you've taken up another fishy job. You very well know that such jobs meet a bad fate! Why don't you give up such jobs? I only steal from those who steal these people. What if something happens to you, dear? You must've heard the adage, those who're killed by god,.. ..can't be saved by anybody. You're always saying it wrong! Those who're protected by god, can't be killed by anybody. You understood, didn't you? I'm leaving! At least have your breakfast. Uncle, I'll have my breakfast in Kaalu's lap. You won't get breakfast. Don't you know it's a Saturday? Kaalu goes on rounds on Saturdays! Come be quick! Be quick! Come, come! Who are you? Hey what'who are you'! Show this smartness to someone else. Scoundrel, tell me where Kaalu is. Rogue, you seek Kaalu's whereabouts in his territory? C'mon! Come! Don't beat me up! I'm not a goon! You try to act smart? These people made me a goon! Don't hit me brother.. Oh lord! My lord! My master! Why are you beating me up? Why are you breaking my limbs? That too, in my territory! Who sent you? - Chandu's money! Chandu, that.. I'll give you double the money. I will give you thrice the amount! Crush him like a bag of chips. Go to him and send him to a hospital, pal. Go! Advance? - Take this. It's gold. Take it. It weighs 2 sovereigns. My bones are aching! He's gone mad! Don't treat my head like my feet. What are you doing? It's tickling me! Don't touch me there. My legs are dangling. Will your father come to keep it there? I'm in pain, why are you wailing? This voice sounds familiar! Chandu, you?! - Kaalu, you're very cunning! You came here instead of the graveyard. You humiliated me in my territory! Bloody thief! How dare you! Aren't you ashamed to cheat! You didn't return my money! And on top of that you had me beaten! I swear on god! Today, whatever remains of you, I will break it like bag of chips! Hail divine mother! - Hail almighty! May I come in, sir? - Do come in, Sampat. What's the news? The news is that a consignment of weapons.. ..is going to land at Manori Islands. At 2.30 tonight. Thank you, Sampat. Thank you very much. But remember, this news shouldn't reach Tavde. - Don't worry, sir. Good morning, sir! Hello! Captain D'mello? - Yes, Capt. D'mello speaking. Yes D'mello, I am Bharat Shrivastav speaking. Listen to me carefully. A consignment of weapons is arriving.. ..at Manori Islands at 2.30am tonight. Please change the route. Got it? - Ok, sir. Hello! Capt. Sinha? - Yes, sir. Capt. D'mello speaking! Follow me! - Ok, sir. He must be looking for our consignment there. Instead, we've successfully received it here. Take it to the warehouse at Kalina. Our dept. Is proud about officers like you. Thank you! Thank you very much. What happened? How did these blasts occur? I caused these blasts, Pappu Shikari. Because there's no point confiscating your goods. Henceforth, we'll fight each other like this. Your goods will surely land at the docks,.. ..but it won't reach the warehouse. You.. - Don't try anything smart! Look at this! I haven't brought this garland to honour you. It contains your destruction. A time bomb! The remote is with inspector Gautam. Anybody makes a move and he's dead! Sampat! Tavde! Officers like you're a black spot on the dept. I'm ashamed to.. ..see traitors like you wearing a uniform! It's better to die than betray your motherland. ..then don't show me your ugly faces again. Bharat Srivastav! I'm tired of listening to his name! Babu Bangali, send all your men after him. He's set fire to my goods! I want to see him being burnt alive by tomorrow morning! Break his bones into pieces! You did the wrong thing by throwing that bomb at Pappu! But Bangali won't commit the same mistake. This bomb will go off in 5 minutes. You'll be blasted off along with your car. Save yourself if you can! Understood? C'mon! Let's go! Mr. Bharat! Mr. Bharat! What are you doing here? In this condition? There's no time to talk! Remove this garland. Remove it! There's a bomb in it! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Kaalu, you were right. What did you do while sitting in the hospital? Your devotees are cheering outside. You won't understand, fool. It's politics! A few days back, I told a sick MP that he'll become a minister. And he became a cabinet minister. Sheer coincidence! Since then, the people think of me as a saint. Gangsters and god-men rule the field of politics. Just watch, I'll get a piece of land from the govt. I'll accumulate funds from the ministers.. Famous people will come to meet me. Within no time, I'll become a powerbroker. Here's the new scapegoat! Bless you! May god fulfill your wishes! Bless you! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Hail Kalendra Swami! Sikander, you? I was on my way to your house. It's good that you came. I'll save on conveyance. How are you? - Yes, I'm fine. Chandu, you must've heard that proverb,.. ..the thief leaves by deceit, not stealthily. It's wrong! The thief leaves stealthily, not by deceit. You understood, isn't it? Are you trying to cheat me of my money? You still have to pay me for beating up Kaalu. Give me Rs.10,000! Else the hospital is nearby. I'll pay back every single penny I owe you. I don't want to get beaten up for holding up your money. I was thinking that we can become.. ..millionaires if you join hands with me. Why did you apply the brakes? Don't talk about millions, it excites me. Even the bike has stopped! Hurry up and tell me how do we earn those millions? A builder wants to buy my father-in-law's bungalow. I've fixed up the deal in millions. Why are you spitting? Tell me what to do. That old man is a storehouse of diseases. He consumes 20-25 pills in a day. You've to add a cyanide pill to that. Don't spit! - I won't! Come closer. I'll give you 5 million. 5 million?! - Yes! "I got money. I got my beloved." "Now I'm going to buy a bungalow and a car." "I got money. I got my beloved." "Now I'm going to buy a bungalow and a car." "We'll have servants and maids." "We'll own lockers in banks." "I'll wear a London-made sari." "Now I'm going to buy a bungalow and a car." I got money.

What are you doing? You start dreaming wherever you want to! You hugged me, as if I'm Heena, as soon as I spoke of 5 millions. Look behind! There's a traffic jam! What are you doing? Inspector, those who commit big crimes.. ..are allowed to go scot-free,.. ..but we're arrested just for causing a traffic jam? You must've heard the saying,.. You're blabbering again! The thief scolded the policeman. - You understood, didn't you? Yes, I did. Inspector, I'm the son-in-law of an affluent man. There'll be problems if my photo is printed in the newspapers. Moreover, he was driving. I was just sitting. I didn't even honk. - Shut up! This is the right punishment! Staying in prison for a day or two will bring you to your senses. Understood? Hello, Gautam! - Brother, you? Yes, I was passing this way. Thought I should remind you.. I very well remember that it's your birthday today. This is Mr. Bharat! Happy birthday, Bharat! Sikander?! Nothing, brother. They just caused a traffic jam. They were sitting on their bike and dreaming of becoming millionaires. I owe a lot to him, Gautam. He saved my life the other day. You'll celebrate my birthday only because of him. If you want, I can sign his bail. Ok, brother. Kadam, release them. Thank you, Bharat! Many happy returns of the day! Where are you all hiding? Where have you all disappeared? C'mon! Sangita! Bunty! It's enough! C'mon! Come out now! Where are you? Come out! I'm tired of searching. I'll cut the cake if you don't come out in two minutes. Ok! Hello! - Hello, papa! Happy birthday! So this is your new style of wishing me this year? Naughty! Where are you calling from? He's calling from Teja's den, Mr. Bharat Srivastav. Enough of your games! Papa. - Now I'll make the last move. If you act smart, then you'll have to pay a hefty price for it. What do you want? - This time, you've to do what I want. Talk business! - Tomorrow, my ship will arrive at Retibunder. You'll see to it that the consignment of weapons.. ..goes through the security check. - Never! I'll never let that happen. - Ok. You can at least go to the market. Hello, daddy! - Bunty! Please do as they say! We want to celebrate your birthday, papa. I hope you haven't cut the cake yet. Papa, please release us from them. Papa, please! Papa, take us away from here! Papa! What happened to you, Bunty? Let me talk. What happened to you, Bunty? - Nothing has happened yet. But it's possible. Think about it. Neither your virtues, nor your uniform. But I can't trust you. It's alright if you don't trust me. But you do trust your men, don't you? Here! Talk to them. ..Bunty, Rajni and aunty are in danger. Did you hear? Now you'll do as I say. My men will call you as soon as they reach the check-post. And when my job's done, inspector.. ..Gautam will come home with your family. This isn't an honest man's promise but a goon's. Remember this. We goons keep our promises. May I come in, sir? Please don't give me another wrong news. Please go away! I'm ashamed of you. My blood boils on seeing dishonest officers like you. Sir, today I've come to repent for my dishonesty. Shikari brothers'weapon consignment is going to arrive at Retibunder. Sir, your honesty and virtue has.. ..prompted me to kill the traitor in me. It's my promise! Believe me! Sampat, the words of a dishonest man have no value. You've again come to fool me. I know that the consignment is to arrive at the Nerul docks. No, sir. I swear on my only son. Please trust me, sir. Only those who're worthy of trust can be trusted. Prepare to go to Nerul. This is an order. But sir, you had told me that.. Yes, I know. But the information has been leaked.. ..and they've changed the route. I got this information from.. ..the captain of their ship, who's our informer. Do as I say. Take the security towards Nerul. But, sir.. - D'mello, this is an order. Ok, sir. Hello! Mr. Sinha, Capt. D'mello speaking. Turn all the boats towards Nerul. We've to be there tonight. Quick! Ok, sir. Teja speaking! - Boss, the job's done. Give the phone to that officer. Yes. - Thank you, Bharat Srivastav. Go home. Your family will be there to receive you. - Ok. Pakiya, release them. Bunty! Bunty! Sangita! Bunty! Gautam! It seems they're here. Papa! - Bunty! Bunty. - Brother, we have come! Bunty! Sangeeta! Officer, did you see the consequences of your action? You confiscated our goods on the way. And even we finished our job on the way. Just like the judiciary, even the mafia has its principles. You'll get enough medals and promotions. But you'll never get back your own people. - Bunty! Never! "Neither is anyone near, nor is there any hope." "My life is nothing but a dead corpse." "Whom do I call out to? Whom do I name?" "How do I stop these tears? Whom do I hold on to?" "There's no one to call my own." Welcome, Teja! They replaced the weapons.. ..Bharat Srivastav confiscated with toy guns. And the weapons in this tempo have been shifted to that tempo. You can take it whenever you want to. Inspector Khadke, you've weakened the case by doing this. But he's become as cold as stone after.. ..seeing his family on the funeral pyre. Bharat Srivastav! You're here! When a policeman forgets his duty and becomes a dog.. ..then how he wags his tail and licks.. ..Teja, I have come to see that. Bharat Shrivastav! Be in your limits! - Don't scream! My limits have increased on resigning my job. Because I'm a free citizen now. And the powers of a free citizen is.. ..more than that of a leader, commissioner or a govt. Servant. You couldn't do anything in uniform,.. ..what can you do now by getting helpless, Bharat Shrivastav! I gave up my uniform.. ..because traitors like you and dishonest men like.. ..him have deprived it of its value. But remember that my heart's on fire. And I'll set fire to your lives. Look, these are the ashes of my family. They'll be immersed in water, the day I reduce your family to ashes. I hope that it doesn't happen that.. ..you'll burn in Teja's fury.. ..and there won't be anyone to light your funeral pyre. Teja Shikari, you began your life with a cry.. ..and it'll end with the cries of pain caused by me. Yes, brother. Nowadays, he goes to the M.K. Gandhi hospital.. ..and the police station. Brother, he has left his home and.. ..is living in room no. 504 of hotel Horizon. This means that my guess was right! Ansubhai, it isn't safe to let him live. It seems we've to finish him off. Brother, shall I set fire to his hotel room? Why set fire to the room? Let's bomb the hotel. None of us should do the job. Because this issue has reached the central govt. Moreover, the press have made him a hero by exaggerating this issue. Ansubhai, have him killed by someone,.. ..so that his death appears natural. I know such a man. Who's he? Welcome Salim! Congratulations on your release and your new job. - New job? What new job? - Meet him. He's Teja's man. He's come to hire us. A custom officer has to be killed. We'll be rewarded well. My name is Salim Surti. Surti! Satan by face and evil in ideas? That's why people call me Salim-the evil? One can escape from Satan, but not from me. I've to settle scores with that scoundrel Sikander. And then the other work! Find out the whereabouts of her beloved. Find out! "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "I'm tired of this world." "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "I'm tired of this world." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "I'm tired of this world." "My lover has drowned in my eyes." "On seeing you, my heart said.." "..that I've found my goal." "The strength of your arms have.." "..sowed the seeds of desire in me." '..sowed the seeds of desire in me." "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "I'm tired of this world." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "I'm thinking of dedicating my.." "..dreams and my life to you." "It's my desire to write a.." "..new story on your tresses." "Write a new story." "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "Crazy! Mad! Wanderer!" "I'm tired of this world." "I'm tired of this world." "My lover has drowned in my eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "My lover has drowned in my eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." "Your lover has drowned in your eyes." Sikander! Who has drowned? This is our house, not the ocean. Sikander! Uncle Abdul?! - You're always lost in your dreams. Dreaming about bungalows and cars. Today, you're talking about drowning. Uncle, you must've heard of that adage.. ..the drowning man keeps the hay afloat. You're always saying it wrong! The hay keeps the drowning man afloat. Yes, you understood. That's enough. Yes, I did. But it'll be better if you mend your ways. Tomorrow, on the festive night, if you mend your ways.. ..then even the lord will fulfill all your dreams and desires. I'll pray to the lord that you marry Heena. - Amen! Aunty! Congratulations! Holy month of Ramadan has arrived. Same to you, dear. May the lord shower you with joy and always keep you happy! Amen! Welcome, Sikander. Congratulations, aunty. May the lord bless you with a long life! ..life must be long and boring. - No, fool! Life should be short and sweet. - Yes! You understood, didn't you? Moreover, what's life without Heena? Sikander, the holy month of Ramajan begins tomorrow. Will you listen to me? - Tell me. I won't call you a scoundrel henceforth. Is that all, aunty? Heena told me your true nature. Let along false testimonies, Sikander will do whatever you say. Tomorrow, your son's new life starts along with the holy month. Sikander! Come out if you have the guts! Sikander, close the door if you want. But today, Salim will make you repay for his prison term. Bring out your tape recorder. That day, I had raped an ordinary girl. But today, I'll rape your blue-eyed beloved. That too, in your presence. Sikander! Stop! Break his bones! He should remember me! Rascal. Who are you? Leave her! Scoundrel! Move aside! - Leave me! Let her be! - I won't spare you! Leave her! Scoundrel! Old woman! Where will you go? Let me go! Let me go! I won't spare you, today. - Help! Sikander! I won't spare you. Help me! Sikander! Shout! Shout louder! No! Shout! - Leave her, rogue! Leave her! I'll kill you! Sikander, she.. - Heena! Nothing will happen to you, Heena. O God! What has happened, Sikander? - Heena. Sikander, I can't see anything. Doctor, will Heena be able to see? Will she be alright? Why are you so silent, doctor? The wounds on her face are ordinary. They will heal. But her eyes are severely damaged. None of the doctors here can operate on her eyes. Then Heena.. - You're very lucky. The doctor who's renowned all over for such surgeries,.. ..Dr. Johnson, is here to attend a seminar from London. Then do something, doctor. Have him operate upon Heena's eyes. This poor man will always be grateful to you. Sikander, such sentiments can move an Indian, not a foreigner. Dr. Johnson is a professional man. There's a lot of difference in his charges and in ours. Moreover, he'll insist on being paid in foreign currency,.. ..which could go upto a million. Whatever it is, doctor, talk to Dr. Johnson. Don't worry about the money. I'll get it for you. But restore Heena's sight at any cost. That innocent girl has been punished for our crimes. She hasn't even seen life yet. Her life's been flooded with darkness. Her life's ruined! No, aunty. I won't let Heena's life be ruined. Don't touch me! Go away from here! I'll never pardon you! Your crimes will never be forgiven! I want my Heena's eyes back. Else I'll seek justice from god. I'll shout out to him that you're.. ..the one who has ruined my niece's life. He's the one who blinded her! He's the criminal! He's the one! Aunty, you must've heard the saying.. I don't want to listen to your wrong proverbs. Go away from here! Today, I'll tell you the proverb correctly. You must've heard the saying, god helps the bold. ..risk his life to restore Heena's sight. God bless! Ansubhai, I need a lot of money. I've to restore Heena's sight. Do something. Sikander, I've come to give you a job. And I've also brought the money. But the job's a bit risky. I'll risk my life for Heena. Just tell me the job and the money. The money's here. I've brought this for you. Here's the advance. The rest after you finish the job. What do I have to do? - It's all written in this. This is the toy you've to use to do it. Heena! Come outside! Look! - What happened? The moon's visible. - The moon is visible? Yes. Come. Look! In front of you. On the trees! Slightly visible! It's a little crooked. Did you see? Uncle, how can I see? I'm.. O Almighty.. Child, forgive me. Heena, forgive me. On seeing the moon, I forgot.. Uncle, won't I ever be able to see? Heena, you'll be able to see. Surely! Sikander! - Heena, I've arranged for your eye operation. If god wishes, you'll be able to see again. - O god! May god make your words come true! - Why not!? I've paid the money in the hospital. Here's the receipt. Heena has to be admitted in the hospital tomorrow. The operation will be conducted in a few days. And uncle, everything will be fine after that. Everything will be fine. But where did you get so much money from? Are you doing something that you shouldn't? No, uncle. I'm not doing anything that I shouldn't. You must've heard the proverb that.. ..those who don't have anything, don't have god with them. You're always saying it wrong! Those who don't have anybody, have god with them. You understood, didn't you? Yes. - Fine! Uncle, the lord has heard our prayers. - Yes, dear. I'll offer the prayers. Take Heena inside. - Ok. Sikander, you can lie to uncle. But not to me. Tell me the truth. Are you doing something wrong for my operation? Heena, even if I pay with my life for your operation,.. ..it's not a very heavy price. I've fixed up a cheap deal. Bharat! Cheers!

This window and this door will open only with this remote. And sweetheart, this place is very isolated. Leave me! Help me! Is somebody around! Help me! Nobody can save you now! Help me! Leave me! Hello brother! - Not your brother,.. ..I'm the one who has the remote of your car. Who are you? Your death! Chinu, you'll only live for a few moments now. Look down. Sir, someone has sent these flowers. Read it! This is my gift to Chinu. I'll send a similar one when you die. But sadly, you won't be there to see it. Read further! Today Cheenu has died.. ..then tomorrow Pappu will die. And then I will only dial Tinu's nymber! I have composed your death songs. I just have to execute them. I'll wipe out your empire. - No! Who's this new enemy?! What happened, Tinu? Did you find out anything about the murderer? No. - I've lost my sleep since I heard of Chinu's death. I'll be able to sleep in peace only when you behead that guy. Chinu! My brother! What happened? Who's crying? - Pappu! Tell him to wipe them off. Send Pappu here to sign the deal for which Chinu was supposed to come. Your attention please, All the passengers.. Mr. P. Shikari! - Yes? Are requested to proceed for final check up. Thank you. - It's alright. Thank you! - Next! Hello. - May I help you? Good evening! - Your seat. It's ok. - Thank you. Welcome! - Thank you very much. Please be seated. Cigarette? Thank you. - Welcome! It seems I've seen you somewhere. Everyone in this world, meet each other at some point of time. Well said! Where are you going? - Delhi! It's cheaper and more luxurious. There are many more advantages of a hopping flight. Pappu. - Pappu? Shikari. - Shikari? Kindly pay attention! We welcome all of you aboard. We are preparing for take off. We request you to sit straight. Close the loft. And fasten your seat belts. Wish you a happy journey! Thank you! Would you like a soft drink? - Thank you. How about you, sir? Would you like a soft drink? - No, thanks. Would you like something? - No. Thank you. If possible, kindly get me a pillow and a blanket. And please don't disturb. I want to sleep well. Thank you! Please! Excuse me, sir. Your blanket. Thank you. - Welcome! Attention please! We're reaching Delhi. We request you to fasten your seat belts. Thank you. Greetings! We welcome you aboard flight JA407. The flight to Sharjah from Delhi is 3070kms long. We'll complete the flight in 3 hours and 20 min. What is it, Aslam? Why did you call for me? Where's Pappu? - Sir, look there. It seems Pappu has reached. I'll check. Pappu, have you reached? - No, Tinu. Dharma here. Someone has killed Pappu in the flight. - What? No, brother! Impossible! What happened? - We've a new enemy in India, Teja. Pappu.. - Pappu?! What is it, Teja? That scoundrel killed Pappu in the flight. What? - Brother. His life can be the cause of our death. - No! Before that, I'll put him to death. Have you accomplished that Singapore job? - Yes, sir. Dharamchand speaking! - Brother, this is Teja. I've enquired about all the passengers in the flight. None of them are our enemies. - So? Brother, you might remember that Pappu has a golden lighter. There's a spy-cam in that. And it's been his habit to photograph every person.. ..he meets in the pretence of lighting their cigarette. If the murderer was sitting next to him.. ..then Pappu must've surely photographed him. I've found the lighter in his pocket. ..then you'll get his picture by fax within the next 2 hours. Bharat Srivastav! I told you not to underestimate this bastard. Kidnap that doctor who conducted his funeral rites. Lights off! Open your eyes slowly! Yes! Good! Good! Uncle Abdul! Uncle Abdul! I'm able to see! Yes. I can see everything. I can see! Good morning! - Good morning, sir! Good morning! - Good morning, sir! Good morning, sir! Leave me. What do you want? - Is Bharat Srivastav alive? I won't tell you. You will tell us. Even the dumb start speaking here. I'll tell you! Leave me! He's alive. It wasn't your plan to kill him.. ..but he had planned to get himself killed. This isn't nonsense. I'm telling the truth. When he came to know that you've bribed the law and the police.. ..then he got himself killed, in order to revenge you. That's why he left his home and stayed in a hotel,.. ..so that you could suspect him and arrange for his death. Then who was the one whom Sikander killed? It was a corpse. An unclaimed corpse. I had disguised it like Bharat Srivastav.. ..and placed it in the room,.. ..Mr. Teja Shikari, you think you're the best. But Bharat Srivastav will outdo you! You scoundrel. Hello! - Ansubhai, listen.. ..to our next move. Sikander, I'm telling the truth. Heena is able to see now. Ansubhai, you must've heard the proverb,.. ..there's darkness in the lord's house, not delay. You're always saying it the other way around! There's delay in the lord's house, not darkness. Understood. You just need to come out in the open. What do you mean? The murder for which you've been punished, isn't a murder. That guy is still alive. - What nonsense are you saying? I shot him with these hands! - You're right. But the one you shot wasn't Bharat Srivastav. Then? - It was a corpse. A dead body. It was wearing the mask of Bharat Srivastav. He wanted to prove himself dead and trapped you in the process. That's the game! Have him arrested and you'll be spared. Constable! Help me! Help! - Shout loudly, Ansubhai! Leave him. Leave him.. leave him. Leave him.. leave him. Open the door! Hurry up! Whether it's one murder or more,.. ..the maximum punishment is the death sentence. Open the door! C'mon! Hurry up! Go inside! Lock the door! Where are you running to? Constable, nab him! Sir, you and here, at this time? Bahadur, if somebody calls me or comes to meet me,.. ..tell them I'm not in. And don't wake me up unless I do. - Ok, sir. It's good! Now I can sleep peacefully. Mr. Bharat Srivastav, enough of your act. Surrender yourself to the law! Unless I've my revenge, I won't surrender, even to death. You can escape death, not Sikander. I'll have you arrested. Aren't you surprised on seeing Dharma Shikari? Don't believe that garland, he isn't dead. He's still living abroad and running his illegal business. He's cheating the world, and enjoying his life. He killed my parents. He ruined my childhood. I won't spare him! Dharma snatched your parents from you. And his brothers, snatched my family. They're the Shikari brothers. He's the eldest of the Shikari brothers. The Shikari family is the cause of our destruction. Today, I came to kill Tinu, and found you instead. I escaped from police custody and followed you here. After coming here, I realized that our cause is the same. If our cause and destiny are the same,.. ..then why are our ideas different? Why is one genuine and the other fake? One is honest and the other dishonest. One's a friend and the other an enemy. Bharat, Shikari brothers used me as a pawn to kill you. And their motive will be to seek revenge. Brother! Calamity has befallen! Our plan has failed. - What do you mean? I mean, our enemies have united. - Enemies? Bharat Srivastav and Sikander. What are you saying, Tinu? This is impossible. I saw it with my own eyes, Ansubhai. Bharat came to the farmhouse to kill me.. ..and Sikander followed him there. But on seeing brother's photo, our plan made a back flip. But why would Sikander do that? Because he has found out that.. ..brother killed his father, DCP Sikander Khan. Teja, guess we've to pay a hefty price! I think we should escape at the earliest. What are you blabbering? Are the Shikari brothers cowards? You're right, Teja. If you flee from India.. When I left India, we were weak. But we're too powerful now, for anyone to clash against us. What harm can those two do to us? - You're right, brother. Arrange for the funeral rites of Pappu. We'll burn our enemies in that pyre. Only time will tell who defeated whom. Sikander, this is the map of the place.. ..where Pappu Shikari's funeral rites are to be conducted. It's a 100 acre property. Surrounded by dense forests. ..that it's impossible to cross them. We've to cross the jungles in order to get there. If we start at midnight, then we'll reach there by dawn. I've arranged for the weapons. I'll be receiving some more weapons as well. It seems he has come. Your ploy of killing yourself is over, Bharat Srivastav. Now, you're under arrest. But.. - No ifs and buts! Nab him! Inspector, check the house. - Yes, sir. Sir, I've checked the entire house, there's no one here. Ok. Let's go! - C'mon! Who is it? Beware. Didn't Tinu come? - He must be on his way, brother. What happened? Run! Tinu! - Who did this to you? I did this to him. If anybody tries to even touch me, I'll blast Tinu off. Teja, you must've heard the adage,.. ..The one bitten by water doesn't ask for snake. You're saying it wrong! The one bitten by a snake doesn't ask for water. That's it! You understood, didn't you? Enough! Teja, who's this mongrel? Not a mongrel, but a lion cub. I'm DCP Khan's son. Dharma, I'm not a coward like you to attack from behind. I'm a man. I attack upfront. Despite being a cop, your father couldn't fight me. What can you do? It isn't upto you to fight Dharma. Look there! Did you see? They aren't real policemen, but impostors. Those who clash against me die a dog's death. He had bombed my brother and ruined our stuff. Today, I've hung a bomb around his neck and can blow him off anytime. I've vowed to light your pyre with the flames of my brother's pyre. If you want Bharat alive, then handover the remote. No, Sikander. Don't do that! We've to kill them today, come what may! Handover the remote! Who did that!? Brothers, Sikander is our man. Help him! Where are you running to, scoundrel! You will die too. Round and round! The goons go round and round! Round and round! Round and round! Kaalu! Scoundrel.. traitor! No! Tinu! Teja! Bharat Srivastav! Sikander, don't spare.. Mr. Bharat! Mr. Bharat! Sikander! I don't regret dying anymore. Sikander, remember that truth always triumphs. Truth always triumphs! Mr. Bharat! By killing the anti-social elements.. ..who were a threat to the society and the nation. Sikander has helped the police and the judiciary. In view of this, the court acquits Sikander Khan. I was sure that Sikander would be acquitted. It's god's grace, dear. Sikander-the cure! Wonderful! Idiot, henceforth, I won't do any wrong job. You don't need to do anything wrong now. 5 million! - My father-in-law passed away! Here's your money. 5 million! Give me the cassettes. Come to the graveyard and collect it. My money. - Graveyard? Sikander, you must've heard the saying,.. ..false always triumphs. It's alright! If both of you blabber together, it'll make sense. It's not false always triumphs, it's truth always triumphs. You understood, didn't you? Yes. - Fine! That's enough! Even you understood, didn't you? Then sing along! "I got money. I got my beloved." "I got money. I got my beloved." "Now I'm going to buy a bungalow and a car." "We'll have servants and maids." "We'll own lockers in banks." "I'll wear a London-made sari." "I got money. I got my beloved." "I got money.
