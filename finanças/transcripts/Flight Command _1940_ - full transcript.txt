Final crash report from fighting 8, sir. They've searched the whole area. There's no trace of Wilson's body. Tell them to abandon search and return to North Island. Inform Mrs. Wilson. Curly Wilson was her whole life, sir. Yes. Yes, he was a fine flier. Good shipmate. There's a request from Commander Gary Of the fighting 8, sir. His Hellcats would like to fly directly after service in chapel. Pay tribute to Wilson? Yes, sir. Permission granted. Aye, aye, sir. Hello, Bill. Hello, Lorna. Janet Wilson get away all right? Well, if putting her on the train means getting away all right. How about coming home to dinner? Sorry, darling. I can't. Oh, I didn't cook it. Well, that does make it more attractive. Say, I like that. Ha ha ha! I guess Janet is hit pretty hard, but she'll come out of it ok. She'll find somebody to take Curly's place one of these days. I don't know about that. She loved him very much. Sure she did... No more than Curly loved her. If she'd gone first, Curly would have taken it standing up, and if my number had been Curly's, You wouldn't have taken it the way she did... Not you! How right you are, Mr. Gary. I'd go skirting around corners Looking for another Commander to say "I do." Far be it from me to devote my life to one selfish man. Ha ha! Come on, give me a kiss and get yourself out of here. I got work to do. Oh, no, none of your blarney. Come on, now. You've done enough work For your country for one day, and home you come. Darling, I have got to see the Admiral about filling Curly's place. He's sending us a reserve from Pensacola. Now, out you go! All right, I go, but under protest. Don't be too late, darling. I won't. I'll drop by and see that brother of mine. Toodle-oo. Bye. Old sailors never die they just sail away... Who's there? Friend. Just your little sister. Hello, Yippy. Hello, Jerry. Working? Just a few minutes till dinnertime. Oh, good evening, Mrs. Gary. Hello, Spike. Oh, I'm going over to the shop, sir, to get another resistor, but, uh... I don't think it will do any good. You're such an optimist, Spike. Thank you, sir. Can I watch? Nope. Secret. Besides, that guy you married doesn't like women hanging around the station any more than he liked giving me permission to use the hangar for my experiments. Seems a good place to me. I know, but the Skipper doesn't think so. There are government laboratories for experiments and booby hatches for inventors. H-How is it coming? What's on your mind? Janet Wilson? Yes. Why don't you go on home? Oh, that won't help. Bill's busy, and they're waiting for me at home All over the front doorstep... The Willies. Hmm. Nice people, the Willies. Uh, how's the fog landing device coming along? Pretty good... as soon as I can get this right-hand arrow To hold without deviation. See, these arrows are tuned to a ground transmitter which sends out radio impulses. It's just like having a track. One brings you straight down the runway, and the other is sloping and sets you down on the ground. Landing in fog is simple... if it works. You just ride these tracks down blind by keeping the arrows Always on the reference points. It turns fog into sunshi... Hey. Come on, Yippy. Curly's doing all right. They've issued him wings that won't tear off. Yes, but what about Janet? They were married just 3 months ago, Jerry. They were young, terribly in love. She'll never love anyone again. She told me so. She gave it all to him... All the love in her soul. Now life's over for her. She'll have to go on half living, waiting. All right, Yippy, let it go. She's got him to remember, Yippy. I guess there are plenty of girls that would give a lot to have the memory of a fella like Curly Wilson. Yippy, why don't you take this to Bill and let him know how you really feel? Don't you think this business of trying to be a courageous wife is heading you for trouble? I'll call Bill. He'll take you home. No, no, don't, don't. He mustn't see me like this. He wouldn't think much of me. I wouldn't blame him. What do you think of me? I think you ought to be put in a bottle. You're right. Have you got a bottle? Ha ha! It sounds like some of your shipmates. I'll go. All right now? All right, Jerry. My nose red? Red as a running light. Well, serves me right. Night, Yippy. Night. Hey, Jerry, you missed it. Just had a session with the Skipper. Yeah? Why didn't you give me a yell? Come on in. Get the bad news. I don't know why you weren't in on this. What's wrong? The Skipper tell you to stop making faces, Mugger? No. Plenty's wrong. They're trying to hand us a new aviation cadet. Yeah, just sprouting his first wings. Graduates from Pensacola tomorrow. An aviation cadet?! What are we, a nursery school? That's what we told the Skipper. Do they call that a fair deal? Fair on who... Us or the cadet? Us and the cadet! Now, wait a minute. While the meeting gets its wind back, let's have a short interlude for common sense. With this new national defense program, the navy needs lots of fliers. Pensacola's turning out good stuff. Now, once it gets around that the best cadets will go straight to the top fighting squadrons, then we'll have the pick of the colleges climbing over one another to enlist. Yeah, and climbing over everybody else at 400 miles an hour. You're cockeyed. These young reserves are good. It isn't because he's a reserve, Dusty. We've got a lot of good reserves in the squadron now. Sure... Stitchy for one. He admits he's good. Don't you, Mr. Payne? Right. Reserve or not, the going's too hard on a cadet in this outfit. We're getting tough assignments... the closest they can give us to actual war conditions abroad... and we're expected to get top results. Besides, they've always let us pick our own men. What becomes of that... The deep-six? Skipper says we'll still be able to ask for our men. This is a special case. Suppose this green apple doesn't make the grade. Did we ever keep anyone who didn't make the grade? I still say we shouldn't take him! I know a Lieutenant who said no to an Admiral once. Yeah? What happened? He's still a Lieutenant. He's always going to be a Lieutenant! Well, there's your answer. You wouldn't want to put the Skipper in a spot like that, would you? No! We can't do that! Well, I should say not! Well, what are we going to do about it? What? Do about it? Yeah! Oh, that was decided an hour ago with the Skipper. It's all done. We got him. He arrives tomorrow. "It's all done. We got him." Then what are we talking about? We got to talk about something. Aw, if anybody ever tells any of you guys you make sense, slug him! Alan Drake. Congratulations, Mr. Drake. You've done well. You're getting a top assignment. Have you ever heard of fighting squadron 8? The Hellcats? Yes, but don't let that throw you. Remember, you're representing Pensacola. When we send a young man to the fleet, we're saying, "here's a pilot for you. "We've trained him, and we vouch for him. He's ready for any service." The future assignments for a lot of young pilots will depend on how well you do with fighting 8. You must measure up, Drake. Thank you, sir. I'll give them all I've got. Ensign Drake, good luck. Thank you, sir. I'm a Hellcat, I'm a swell cat flying high, da da, da da da 'cause I'm a Hellcat, a swell cat and that's how Hellcats fly Puts that outfit to bed for tonight. Wish this man Drake was tucked in. He's way overdue. What's the weather in the mountains? Hacumba... Thunderstorms and rainsqualls in the mountains. Drake must have caught that. Yes, I'm afraid so. His radio couldn't get through that static. He's either down somewhere or lost. North Island tower from navy 5-4-2-9... can you hear me? Please answer! Rolling in here fast. If he came on through, we've got to send him back. Try and reach him. Navy 5-4-2-9 from North Island tower... Answer. Navy 5-4-2-9 from North Island tower... Answer. Give me the airport at Imperial. I'll wait. Navy 5-4-2-9 from North Island tower... Answer. Naval air San Diego calling Imperial... Request weather report. North Island tower calling navy 5-4-2-9. Thanks. Send Drake back to Yuma. Fog's on the ground at Imperial. Can't raise him, sir. Well, you got to raise him! He can't land here! North Island tower from navy 5-4-2-9... Can you hear me? Answer! North Island tower from navy 5-4-2-9... there he is. North Island tower calling navy 5-4-2-9... We've been sitting on tacks for an hour. What's your position? That's what I'd like to know. Storm's in the mountains. Been cruising through fog for a couple of hours trying to find a hole. My beam receiver isn't working. Unable to pick up a directional beam. Gas running low. I have about 10 minutes left. Well, that won't take you back to Yuma! Fog's on the ground here. There's no field clear you can reach. Keep talking. We'll try and get a bearing on you. Navy 5-4-2-9... get a bearing on navy 5-4-2-9. Navy 5-4-2-9. Testing. Navy 5-4-2-9. Testing. Catch him? Yes, sir, bearing 8-5 true, sir. North Island tower calling navy 5-4-2-9... Come on in. Head west true. We'll check on you. If you're more than 40 miles away, you're sitting on a mountain. Telephone Commander Gary there's a stray Hellcat loose in this fog. He'd better get over here. Aye, aye, sir. What's up... Drake in trouble? Yes. I'm trying to bring him over the field. If I only had my gadget working, we'd bring him through that soup and set him right down beside the hangars. Maybe, but would he be right side up? Hey, pipe down, you two. There's his motor now! Bring your mike. North Island tower from navy 5-4-2-9... I must be getting close, but I can't see anything! Can you hear my motor? Drake, we hear you. You're approaching the field. I'll spot you where your plane won't crash anything. You'll have to bail out. What? Bail out? Crash this brand-new plane? but she's what you dream about! Cruises at 350, dives at 600. I can't do that! I'm coming in! He's crazy! Thinks he can get down through this. Get the ambulance and crash truck! I think I see the field lights. He's too far east. He'll hit the control tower! Order him up out of there! Pull up, Drake! Drake, this is squadron Commander fighting 8. Don't try that again! Climb to 2,000, fly due west one minute, and when I tell you, hit the silk! Wind's to the west. You'll drift in over the field. If you're lucky. I'm at 2,000 flying due west. You're set, Drake. Bail out! Good-bye, baby! The wind shifted. He's liable to land in Mexico. All hands out. Have patrols cover all the seaward areas of the station. Get the ambulance rolling. Be sure they have a inhalator. Aye, aye, sir. Yes, please? I wonder if I could come in a minute and use your phone. Excuse, please. I don't want to be excused. I want to use your phone. Excuse, please! Oh, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm a flier, see? Aviator. Navy. Savvy? Now, look... me fly. Parachute. Splash. Underwater. Glug, glug. Now want phone. Ha ha! Sorry for butting in like this, but don't be alarmed. I'm from the naval air station. Could I use your phone? I'm not alarmed. Did I hear you say you had to bail out? Are you all right? Yes, yes, I'm all right. A couple of minutes ago, I wasn't so sure. I thought I'd landed in China! Jung, get a towel, will you? Tough luck landing in the ocean. Ah, it doesn't mean a thing in my outfit. What is your outfit, mister... Drake... Alan Drake. I'm one of the Hellcats. Oh, you're one of the Hellcats? Yeah. You've heard of the Hellcats, haven't you? Well... indirectly. Best outfit in the fleet, Best fliers, best bunch of fellas. Remember that serum rescue flight to Costa Rica a couple of years ago? That was Rhodes. He's a Hellcat. and our Skipper Bill Gary... He's tops and tough. He led the Alaska flight that brought the Harrison expedition safely through last winter. Maybe you've met him, Living near the air station like this. Yes. I seem to remember meeting him somewhere. Certainly heard a lot about him. They say he has the sweetest wife. Uh, wife? Oh, yes. Wait a minute. I'll use that phone, if you don't mind. I've got to report. I can't stand around talking all night. Not on my carpet. Ha ha! Sorry. I've kind of messed things up, haven't I? Oh, never mind. You'd better make your phone call and start along. Even Hellcats catch pneumonia. Operations. This is ensign Drake, sir, reporting for duty. Suppose you know what happened. I'm awfully sorry. Are you all right? Good. Relax, Bill. It's the pride of Pensacola. He's safe and sound and sorry about the whole thing. Tell him to get in here. It's about time you piped up. They've got patrols searching all over the place. What telephone wires are you hanging from? I'm in a house on the beach. Landed in the ocean. I wonder if you could send a car for me. I'm pretty wet. You're all wet. We don't run a taxi service. So walk, run, swim, but get over here quick under your own power. Everything all right? Oh, sure, sure. Everything's all right. They just want me to get over there fast. We don't waste any time in our outfit. I wonder if I could call for a taxi. Oh, a taxi would take 20 minutes. I'll run you over. Oh, no, thanks. I've been enough of a nuisance already. Jung, get the car, will you, please? I'll get a coat. Well, now, Mr. Drake, if the Hellcats are so terribly good, and I'm sure they are from all you say... They're great. You must have had a pretty high record at Pensacola to come right into them. Well, I worked pretty hard. Everybody works hard at Pensacola, Keeping pace with the defense program, but you see, fighting 8 ask for their men. Think of my luck getting asked for by the Hellcats! I'm sure you must have rated it. and all I'm sure of is I'm knocking on wood. Fresh out of Pensacola. Ha ha! I really don't know much more about the Hellcats than you do, but I'll learn, all right, and quick. Certainly. Cadet yesterday, Commander next week. Think you're kidding? Not next week or next year, but someday. With a break like this, a man ought to be shot if he doesn't go places. Well, here's the first place, Hellcat... Naval air station, North Island. North Island. The Hellcats. Should I pinch myself? Well, thanks a lot. You've been swell. Say, I'd like to be seeing you sometime. We'll be seeing each other. Right now you'd better jump in there and report. Ha ha! Yeah. Good night! Hey, miss, what's your name? You've come to us with two things, Mr. Drake... a big buildup and no experience... and what happened tonight makes the first of those look pretty sick and proves the second. Just what was your idea up there? You heard the order to bail out, didn't you? Yes, sir, but I thought I could bring her in. How could you possibly bring her in? You couldn't see the field lights. You couldn't even see your wingtips. You thought. Well, that's something... because in this outfit you've got to think... mostly fast, but first you've got to obey. I know that, sir. I just didn't want to crash that plane, that's all. It's not a matter of what you want or don't want. You had orders. The navy can build a dozen planes for every good pilot we can find to fly them. You're no good to us dead. Does that make any impression? Yes, sir. Good. Glad to have you aboard, Drake. Thank you, sir. You're the junior pilot around here, and you're under the gun, so just obey orders and fly the best you can with your eyes open and your mouth closed. Aye, aye, sir. You'll find a room ready for you in B.O.Q. I've had some dry things laid out... a pair of pajamas and an outfit for tomorrow. Now, I suggest you hit your bunk early because you're in for a tough week. We put you through it around here before you take your place in squadron formation. Yes, sir, thank you, but I was wondering If I couldn't meet some of my new shipmates tonight. We've heard a lot about them at Pensacola. Oh, I don't know why not. You'll probably find some of them in the officers' lounge. Good night, Drake. Good night, sir. Oh, Drake. If it will make you sleep any better, there isn't a man in the fleet who could have landed that plane tonight. Thank you, sir. It will. That's rubber. Let's go to bed. Say, I've just met him... Pensacola! He's going in to report to the Skipper. What's he like? Oh, he's a well-put-up sort of a fella. Kind of handsome. I'm sort of his hero. Why? Did you make a face for him? So you're his hero. You're the only one that counts. Well, maybe the others count, too, but I sort of stand out a bit in his mind. I guess he'd like to meet the rest of you. Perhaps we ought to get into full dress uniforms with swords. Now, listen, that guy just fell in the drink in a parachute. Give him a break. We're not going to do anything to him. I just can't wait to meet a guy who thinks he can sit down in soup. Good evening. My name's Drake. I was hoping I'd find somebody around. Ha ha! I'm sorry I messed things up getting in. Hi, Pensacola. I'm Banning. How are you, Banning? This is Payne. Hi. Townsend. Hi, Townsend. and Bush. How are you, Bush? Martin you've met. Yeah, sure. Mr. Rhodes, our executive officer. Dusty Rhodes? All roads are Dusty to a sailor. How are you? Fine, thanks. and Woodward, Frost. Frost, glad to know you. and the rest... Pensacola. Hi, Pensacola! I guess I don't have to tell you how glad I am to be aboard. Are you? Didn't seem so an hour ago. Why? That landing you tried. Thought you were tired of it all. I think I could have let down through that soup. Well, let's hear it. What could you see up there? Jerry, maybe you're wasting your time with that fog device. Say, if you want to bring anything in through fog, just stick Pensacola in the cockpit. He'll get it down. Yeah, new kind of a robot, only this one talks. Now wait a minute. After spotting the control tower, the next approach would have been a cinch. A cinch? How come? Yeah, tell us about it. Well, having spotted the tower, I swing around, climbing until I'm on a reverse course, and I hold that for one minute. Then I change course, 45 to the right, and hold that for 10 seconds. Then I swing left until I'm on my original heading. Yeah, and then what? Well, then I'm heading back to the tower, and clear of it, so I let down. Then pretty soon, there's a clear spot in the fog, and I set down right in the middle of it. There's nothing to it. Wait a minute. Where did the clear spot come from? Did you bring it with you? Me? No! The warmth of the Hellcats' reception. It burned right through the fog. Wait a minute. I'm confused. I thought we were doing the ribbing. Oh, Stitchy, did you walk into that one. Did I? Looks like we bought something from Pensacola. Let's hope when we get him up on the target range, he can shoot off a machine gun as well as he can his face. Let's go to bed. Say, what's Pensacola doing out there on the line? He's got everything on but his chute. So, Dusty, is Drake flying with us this morning with only 5 days shaking down? Skipper will decide that. Relax, Freddy. The Skipper isn't going to send up a green man when we're shooting for a record score. Say, aren't we firing machine gun practice this morning? We? Don't I fly with the squadron today, Mr. Rhodes? Here, drink this. You'll feel better. It's up to the Skipper, and I'm afraid you'll need a little more time shaking down. Maybe, but I'd sure like to know what a guy has to do around here to get out of the first grade. Experience. That's all you need, Pensacola. Yeah, you can't fly with the squadron without experience, and you can't get experience without flying with the squadron. When you were practicing carrier landings out on the field a couple of days ago, you looked mighty cute with your plane standing on its nose. I cut when he signaled. He was the landing officer. Ain't what Mr. Payne thought. What say you, Mr. Payne? I say, pipe down, nuisance. When you've handled green pilots on carrier landings, you can talk, and when green pilots learn how to make carrier landings, they can talk. That's swell. That's fine. First I can't shoot, now I can't talk. I'm sure glad I came. Look, Mr. Payne, was it my fault or yours on that signal? You look. Will you forget you knocked them all dead at Pensacola? You're in the fleet now, working on actual war problems. It so happens, we're firing in competition this morning for a record score. A man a week out of Pensacola isn't ready for my money, and if I was the Skipper, you wouldn't shoot today. Well, that's one break for me. You're not the Skipper. All pilots, fighting 8, man your planes. Here we go. Everybody out. Run along. Captain Gary? Yeah? I was hoping I might be flying with the squadron today. I've had a good shaking down. I'd like a chance to get my teeth into things. Why, of course you're flying. This is squadron competition. Win or lose, we do it with all hands in the air. Thank you, sir. You fly number two in my section. Good going, Pensacola. Let's crack the record. Oh, just a minute, sir. Oh. Uh-Uh. Oh-Oh. There we are. There's your target, sir. Just a fabric sleeve making a couple hundred knots on the end of a line. It ain't so hard to hit once you get the knack of it. Remember how it was at Pensacola? You got to lead it, sir. You know, just like shooting ducks. and don't worry about your score. Take it easy the first time, I always say. Your shipmates will carry you the first practice or two. Pretty good, are they? Good? They've never been beaten. You're going to see some real shooting. Maybe we'll all see some shooting. Maybe when that sleeve gets back you'll be able to cook it for spaghetti. Squadron, right echelon. Drake, you cut that too close. Watch yourself. Plane two, aye, aye. Drake, jump while you still have altitude! Bail out, Pensacola! For pete's sake, bail out! Plane two, Drake in plane two. Plane two, aye, aye. Is your plane all right? Any damage? Everything's all right, sir. Fighting 8 from Commander fighting 8, return to base. Planes 2 and 3, remain in firing area. Plane 2. Plane two, aye, aye. You hit that sleeve because you made a bad approach. Stay out here a half an hour and simulate approaches. Plane 3 will act as escort. Plane two, aye, aye. Look, I messed that up good, I know, but it won't happen again. Uh-Huh. You were ready, all right, Pensacola. I said it won't happen again. That's right. You said it. It won't happen again. We're through competition firing until next year. You can't out-Talk the scoreboard, kid. You didn't have to do all the shooting, did you? We were up there, too, you know. Hasn't anybody in this outfit ever made a mistake before? Yeah, yeah. Forget about it. I did all right on the first run. I hit that sleeve plenty. Yeah, and on the second, you mistook it for a nightshirt. You realize you darn near killed yourself? It was our mistake, not his. We should have figured out some way to keep him on the ground. Maybe it was your mistake for asking for me in the first place. Wait a minute. You ask for your men in this outfit, don't you? Mostly. Well, then you asked for me, didn't you? What difference does it make who asked for who? Come on. Who's going to chow? I'm going. I want to get this straight. Was I asked for in this outfit, or wasn't I? Tell me. Was I asked for? Well, Pensacola, since you're demanding... no. Well, I'll throw the diamond in. Oh, what's the point in arguing? Anybody that reads the papers knows that McCallum was the british flier who bombed the bridges back of Dunkirk. I don't question it. I just say Patterson, his squadron Commander, led the way. 3 bucks says McCallum went in first, and I'll prove... Why don't you cut out the argument? You sound just like Pensacola. Don't start knocking a man who isn't here to defend himself. and would he defend himself? The Hellcats aren't exactly purring over their new cadet, are they? Sure. There's nothing wrong with Pensacola that time won't cure. Really? and when will you gentlemen stop wearing your hearts on a target sleeve? Ouch. Oh, thank you. Hey, what have I done to be promoted? This is Mr. Rhodes'. Sorry, sir. This is foggy french and his lyrical lads about to swing into an hour of rhythmic melody at that popular dancetorium, the regency ballroom, In the heart of Los Angeles. We got a big, happy crowd tonight, folks, a typical saturday night crowd. Every girlfriend's got a boyfriend... Hey, what are you turning out the lights for? What is it around here, bedtime? Oh, no, thank you, sir. Saturday night no bedtime. Some take off uniform, put on civilian suit, go out, see friends. Pretty soon Mr. Drake have plenty fine friends, too. Thank you. Thank you. Say, Mr. Drake just remember he got fine friend. Why, it's the Hellcat. Remember me? Of course. Come in. I wondered when you were going to call. Thanks. I would have been around sooner, only it hasn't been foggy enough to find the house. Dead reckoning's good enough for most pilots, Mr. Drake. Come along in. I'm so glad to see you. I was wondering, if you weren't doing anything tonight, maybe you'd like to put on your dancing shoes and come out with me somewhere. You want me to go dancing with you? Yeah. You see, I don't know many people around here. Don't know anyone, really, so I thought Maybe you'd be kind enough to sort of show me the town. That's awfully sweet of you, Mr. Drake, but I'm afraid you'll have to get an authorization from Commander Gary first. The Skipper? What's he got to do with it? You haven't even learned my name. You don't know who I am, do you? Things were happening kind of fast the other night, weren't they? With all that fog and me making a mess out of your carpet and you driving off so fast. What is your name? Well, take a deep breath, Hellcat. The name's Gary. Did you say Gary? Often described as the Skipper's wife. Oh, it all fits together perfectly. A new pilot always makes a duty call on his squadron Commander and his wife. So come on and join the others. That's very nice of you, Mrs. Gary, but I haven't got any right To come barging in on your party like this. Oh, this is no party. It's just a houseful of Hellcats. Hellcats? Yes. This is sort of their hangar, off duty. Yours, too. Anytime. Whenever anyone in the squadron feels like it, he just drops in. I do appreciate that, Mrs. Gary, but this wasn't really a duty call. I'd rather make it some other time. Oh, you're not going to be sensitive, are you, because you tried to make off with the Commander's lady? No, no. It's not that. Whatever it is, I wouldn't let it spoil your saturday evening. I'm sorry. I'd rather call some other time if you don't mind. but you see, I do mind. and I'm surprised, but not quite pleasantly. Among the traditions of the service, Mr. Drake, is one prescribing certain courtesies for junior officers. I tell you, it was Jim McCallum, and I can't waste any more of my time arguing. Hi, Pensacola. How are you? Jerry, you're not leaving? I can't hang around here all night wrangling with that ape. I got work to do on the device. Good night, Yippy. Yeah, but wait. Mr. Drake just dropped in to pay us a duty call. Maybe he knows something about it. Do you know what british pilot bombed 3 bridges back at Dunkirk, making possible the evacuation of 4 divisions? Sure he does! He reads every word of aviation war news printed. Who was it, and was he alone? All alone. It was McCallum, the New Zealander. Right! I knew it was! So did i! You must come in and back us up! Yep. I got to get this argument settled tonight. I got a new one to start first thing in the morning. Hey, Mugger, here's Pensacola, the flying almanac, and he says it was McCallum alone. Aye, aye, sir. Evening, Drake. Hi, Pensacola. Hiya, Pensacola. Hiya, Pensacola. Glad to see you, Drake. Make yourself at home, won't you? You'll find a drink right there on the table. Thank you, sir. Now, tell Martin is was McCallum without Patterson. It was McCallum what? Bridges, Dunkirk. Oh, yes. It was James McCallum. With his plane full of bullet holes, He got back to dover and crashed. Broke a leg. You're right. No doubt about it. McCallum. New Zealand. Then why say it was Patterson? Just to get you red in the face, Jerry. That's all. Saves turning the heat on. How are you, Pensacola? He's fine, and for winning that small bet, he gets a drink. Miss Blaire, this is Mr. Blake, our latest arrival. Hi, Mr. Drake. How do you do? Miss turner, Mr. Drake. How do you do? Miss turner. Mrs. Frost. How do you do? How do you do? This will open your eyes, Pensacola. Hellcat special. Thank you. What's this? Glad to see you aboard, Drake. Glad to be aboard, sir. Junk! Stubborn, blasted piece of junk! Spike, get me an ax. An ax, sir? No, two axes. We put a whole year into that darned invention... evenings, nights, sundays, holidays... and it won't work! So let's have one glorious 5 minutes of riotous fun and bust it wide open. Get two axes. Seems kind of a pity, sir. After a man spent a whole year With something that won't work, he gets a kind of respect for it. Oh, how can a man be as stupid as I am? Ha ha ha! Hey, Jerry, things can't be as bad as all that. The sun's shining, isn't it? The birds are singing. What's the use of getting sore? Look, Pensacola, maybe the birds are shining for you. You're a Hellcat, full-fledged, on the ground and in the air. Great! but will you take that sickening smile away from here? We're going to have a wake. Ah, come on, now. What's wrong? Fog device won't work? No, the fog device won't work. So just stand back, will you, while I kick it to death. Wait a minute. Don't get all lathered up over some little bug in the thing. You don't want to smash it until you've checked it all over. Maybe you got a loose connection, like in my headphones here. Do you think I'd take it up for a final clear weather flight test without checking it? I've triple-checked, and the direction needle still won't stay on the reference line. It's got the creeps all over the dial! There just must be something wrong. Now, that's quite a deduction. The whole thing's wrong, you dope! It's so wrong, I'm going to put it out of its misery. Wait a minute. Let me get in there and look it over. Sounds like interference on your frequency. You can't just give this whole thing the pitch now. If it works, it'll be a credit to the whole squadron. Will you get out of there? but maybe I can fix it. Fix it? After I've worked a year, you're going to fix it? What makes you think you can fix it? What do you know about radio beam transmission? When I was a kid, I was always fooling around with radio. Had a wildcat set in the barn. I was always butting in on commercial stations. I know a lot about interference. You certainly do! I haven't bumped into so much interference since I played against notre dame. Say, wait. Shut up a second. No, no, no. Don't shut up. Go on talking, babble. Out of the mouth of babes. Come on, say something, anything. It doesn't have to make sense. Look, we're only 15 miles from the mexican border, right? That's perfect. Makes no sense at all. 12 miles. What of it? Well, you've checked everything else around here. What if there were some mexican kids fooling around with amateur radio sets the way I used to do? You know, sending signals, butting in on the regular wave band, setting up interference? Shut up a minute! What are you doing with those axes? You ordered them, sir. Drop them! We're going to tear out that panel! Mr. Drake's double-Crossed me and had an idea. Stand by, Pensacola. Roll up your sleeves and keep talking. Flying is secured for the night, sir, on account of the fog. Old sailors never die, never die, never die old sailors never die they just sail away That you, Spike? Yes. Where's Mr. Drake? Did you find him? He went down to say good-bye to Captain Gary, sir. He must have started before the fog came in, or he'd have been right here. Jerry! Pensacola, come on! Hurry! Where have you been? I've been over at the Skipper's. Lorna sent you a message. She'd like to have you drop by before he leaves. I'll have plenty of time for that. Standing by for a month for a good pea-Soup fog, and when we get it, you're missing. We'll have the whole test done in half an hour. Look at it! It's a monk's prayer! Wait a minute. You're not going to fly in this goo. Why not? With this apparatus, it's clear as a bell out there. Don't waste time talking. Come on. Look, I know the clear weather test worked all right, but why don't we try it in a two-seater before risking this stuff? Then I'll be at the rear controls just in case. I invented it for fog, didn't I? All right, I'm going to fly it in fog! Spike, anybody around? All clear, sir. Let's go. and boy, when we get through, There's going to be a railroad track running right down from the sky. No more getting caught on top with gas running low and no place to sit down. This thing's sort of got me. When I think of what it means, what it can do for aviation, I get the shakes. Let's make a last check. Perfect. Shut her down. You know what you're letting yourself in for, don't you, making this test without authorization? Listen, I've got authorization for everything but a test flight under actual fog conditions. No use even asking for that. They'd grab the equipment right out of our hands, turn it over to an experimental laboratory for further shop tests, and finally fly it with one of their own pilots. and there's nothing in our blueprints that calls for anything like that. You're just begging for a court-Martial. Who cares, if it works? All right, you're the doctor. Spike, open up! Aye, aye! Let's roll her out. You warmed her up? She's hot, sir. Oil's 50, head's 150. She's ok. Thank you. Load the starter. Well, good luck. I wish I were going along. Not tonight, Pensacola. This is our honeymoon. I guess I don't have to tell you, you're the first person that ever took this thing seriously. You've been a lot of help. We wouldn't be taking off if it weren't for you. Ready, sir. Here it goes. What's that? Some fool trying to take off in this weather? He made it, Spike. He's up. Come on, let's get this out near the runway. He's heading downwind. He'll be turning in a minute. He's still climbing. Everything working all right? Yes, sir. Have a look. Is that one of our planes? It isn't a hummingbird. Who is it, and what's he trying to do? Lieutenant Banning, sir. He's testing a fog-landing device. Why, he can't do that. He might get killed. Yeah, so might the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk. Have the ambulance and the crash trucks stand by. Aye, aye, sir. Stand by. He's turning. Stand by, Spike. He's coming in. That doesn't sound right to me. Look out! Well, I hope he's not so sure of that gadget that he left his chute at home. He's got his chute, all right, but he won't need it. He's just lining things up. I'm not worrying. Well, I am. Is that ouija board putting it out all right? Everything looks all right here, sir. Stand by, Spike. He's turning. He's heading back. He's coming in too steep. Is everything working all right? Yes, sir. the direction needle. Something wrong. It's all yours, Pensacola. I didn't give it a chance. I didn't trust it. It'll work. You're going to lick it. Where's Yippy? Won't somebody please get Yippy? Hang on to yourself, darling. Tight. He's badly hurt. He's... the doctors don't give him much chance. Commander Gary, report to scene of crash. Commander Gary, report to scene of crash. Lorna... I know. You've got to go. It's hit all around you, darling, and you've shown the rest how to take it. If it's your turn now when the flag's at half-mast, keep it flying. Yes, Bill. Pensacola. That's it? Just now. He didn't regain consciousness. Will it... will it help any to know that his last thought was for you? He kept asking for you in the ambulance. He wanted to tell you something. And then... just at the end, he said, "tell Yippy everything's all right." I only knew him 6 weeks, but he was the best friend I ever had. He was my best friend all my life. Isn't there something I can do? Don't fight it. I know how you feel. Oh, god. She works, Spike! That's all she needed. 10 days too late. Just a couple of condensers and 100 kilocycles change in frequency. That's all that was needed to bring Mr. Banning safely home that night. Yep. You're right. Come on. Let's try her again. Pensacola? Yes, sir? We're going over to Mrs. Gary's. Would you like to come along? Yeah, I certainly would, but I didn't think she was seeing anybody. I was over there yesterday with Bush, and that's what the China boy told us. She's in bad shape, Pensacola, and with the Skipper away, we've got to do something to help her out of it. Right. I'll meet you over there as soon as we get cleaned up. What's that panel in there? I've rebuilt Jerry's fog device. He asked me to go ahead with it. Oh, he did, eh? Skipper know you're doing this? Why, no, sir. He's been away. I wanted to have it ready when he got back. I think we've got it licked. I was kind of hoping that maybe he'd, uh... get you authorization for a test? Yes, sir. The man's insane! Better forget it, Pensacola. You, too, Knowles. Aye, aye, sir. Right, sir. Be all right if I leave the panel in place for the Skipper's inspection when he gets back? Well, if you really think you've got something. but no test in any weather without proper authority. Aye, aye, sir. See you at Lorna's. Right. This yours, Spike? No, sir. That must have belonged to Mr. Banning, sir. Do you want me to turn it in? No. I'll turn this in myself. Good evening, Jung. Mrs. Gary home? No, sir. Not home. Oh. May I wait? Lady not come home for long time. Well, I, uh... i found something down at the hangar I think she might like to have. I have nothing much to do. I don't mind waiting for an hour or so. Please, mister, no good wait. Mrs. Gary no see anybody. Tell me something... Is Mrs. Gary taking Mr. Banning's death pretty hard? Mister, when Commander Gary coming back? Soon? I don't know. Look, Jung, how is Mrs. Gary? Ever since Mr. Banning dead, Mrs. Gary no see anybody. No eat... no sleep... sometime walk on beach all night. Hello, Mrs. Gary! Good evening. Well, you certainly picked a spot for your evening stroll that'll go down in history. I guess they'll just carve my statue out of that rock over there with a nice little inscription underneath. "At this spot, Admiral Alan Drake "crawled out of the ocean to join the Hellcats, his heart full of hope and his mouth full of minnows." Ha ha! I spotted you through the window... I left a message that I was not at home. Yes, but... Didn't you get that message, Mr. Drake? Sure, I got it. Look, Mrs. Gary, I... I know it's none of my business, but staying by yourself isn't helping things any. You've just got to see somebody while the Skipper's away. Otherwise, the Willies will get you... little brown men with egg on their whiskers. Look, I just bought a new little jalopy. $25 down and the rest when they catch me. How about taking a ride with me tomorrow? It'll bounce those Willies right out of their whiskers. Oh, leave me alone. Please, can't you leave me alone? I'm sorry, Mrs. Gary. I guess... Well, it won't happen again. Oh, I... I found this in the hangar. I thought perhaps you'd like to have it. What is it? It was Jerry's. "Me... Yippy." Mrs. Gary, I... I know I had no right to break in on you like this with a lot of bad jokes, but you and the Skipper have been pretty swell to me... my first friends at North Island, and... well, I don't think I'll ever forget How you helped me to become a full-fledged Hellcat. It isn't right that you should take this all alone. Pensacola? I'm sorry. Forgive me. That isn't necessary. I guess I deserved what I got. No, please. Try to understand. I didn't mean to be rude. That's all right. I don't want you to go away feeling hurt. You needn't think that, Mrs. Gary. It was good of you to bring me this. I haven't forgotten your thoughtfulness and kindness that night at the hospital. I do appreciate it. You're so much like Jerry. That's a pretty nice thing to say about anybody. Would you care to... walk a little way? Sure. This trick has never been done by anyone in his right mind. Now watch. Ha ha ha! I've been training these spoons until they're almost human. They feed off my right forearm. Look at that. Ha ha ha! Is anything wrong, sir? Yeah. Your spoons skid. A customer eating his soup is liable to have a nasty accident. I'm sorry, sir. That's all right. Bring us two small brandies, will you? Thank you, sir. Can't understand it. Never missed before. What is it, Lorna? Did I embarrass you, spilling those spoons all over the place? No. Ah, come on now. You were doing a swell job. I thought we'd bounced those Willies right out of business this last week. It isn't the Willies. Would... Would you mind if we left now? I'd like to go home. Well, what's wrong, Lorna? Please... don't ask any questions. Just take me home. What's wrong, honey? Have you seen a ghost or something? What? Oh, no. No. Nothing. But you must have seen something. A couple of minutes ago, you looked out that window, and you turned all white, and ever since, you haven't said a mumblin' word. You just sit there, smoking and frowning, frowning and smoking. Tell me what it was, honey. What did you see out on that patio? Not a thing. I just thought I did. Oh, I must have been crazy. Well, that's nothing to sulk about, sugar. All aviators are kind of crazy. Hey, take good care of that one. Don't anybody leave more than a $10 tip. Ha ha ha! Hello, stranger! But, Mugger! Evening, Mrs. G! Well, hello, Lorna. How are you? Oh, we're fine. We're always fine. How about you, Lorna? Oh, I'm a long way from where I was two weeks ago. Pensacola's been a great help. Hello, Pensacola! We're meeting Dusty here. Have you seen him? Dusty? No. Look, why don't you two come on in and sit down and have a drink with us? Dusty would be glad to see Lorna around again. Sure. Would you like to, Lorna? Oh, we'd love to, but another night. I have an early appointment in the morning. Do you mind? Not a bit. It's great to see you out looking so well, Lorna. It sure is, lady. Thank you. Good night. My best to Dusty. Good night. Good night, fellas. So long, Pensacola. I'd still like to know what's wrong... what I've done or what's happened. You've done nothing wrong. You came on an errand of mercy. You've been an angel. I'll never forget you. Ha ha! Sounds like a last farewell. It is. But I... I don't get it. Are my jokes that bad? Please don't ask me to explain. I'd rather not. Good-bye, Pensacola. Lorna? Lorna? Hello, Jung. Glad to see you home, sir. Thank you. Darling! It's wonderful to be home again. How are you? Not too good, I'm afraid. Oh, I'm sorry. I wondered why you weren't over at the island to meet me. They've sure got some fine new equipment for us in Philadelphia. There's a new plane there that'll make these look like turtles. She climbs like a... Well, you just wait till you see it. Bill... I'm going away. What? Where? East. Home. Will you get me a reservation on the plane today? What brought this on? Hey. You haven't been taking things the tough way, now have you? I'm afraid I have. Bill, I haven't been quite honest with you. I've tried awfully hard to be everything you wanted, but I can't pretend any longer. I've got to tell you the truth. Lorna, what are you trying to say? When I first met you... that very first summer we fell in love, from knowing you and the kind of man you are, I realized there was only one kind of woman you could care about... a courageous woman, because that's what a Skipper's wife must be. Yes, of course. No, please. Let me say it. Because I loved you, and because I wanted very much to have you love me, I tried to be that kind of woman. But I'm not, Bill. I wish I could be, but I'm not. There were times I prayed you'd see through my pretense and see me as I really am... and love me anyway. I thought surely the night Jerry died, you'd understand. I wanted you to take me in your arms and say, "darling, isn't there something I can do? I know it's killing you." What did you do? You took my arm, hard, looked at me as though you were giving an order and said, "steady. Keep the flag flying." You took me for granted, Bill. You didn't try hard enough to understand what was happening to me inside. Well, now you know. The flag isn't flying. Why didn't you tell me you felt this way? There was no need to pretend. Lorna, for the love of heaven, I love you because you're you. and now you've told me, I still love you. I just understand you better, that's all. Oh, why did I make this a private fight? Why did I keep it to myself? Why didn't I tell you years ago? But what difference does it make? It's all over now. It doesn't matter. There's no reason to go away. But it isn't as simple as that, Bill. I wish it were. If I'd only known... but it's too late now. I've... I've changed. Changed. How? Well, I... I don't exactly know. Since Jerry died, there's been this awful feeling of emptiness. The thought of your return should have been enough to fill it, but it wasn't. And then something happened last night, just as suddenly as you're hearing it now. and that made me realize something we had together is lost. I've got to go away, Bill, and try to find it again. Well... if that's the way it is, you couldn't stay any more than I could ask you to stay. I want to find what I've lost, Bill. I want to come back to you. There's nothing I want so much in the world. Come back for one reason... Because you love me. Right? Right. Here comes the Skipper. He's back! Hello, Skipper. Hello, Dusty. Welcome back. Howdy, Skipper. We missed you. Good trip, Skipper? Yeah. How's Philadelphia? Fine. Good trip, Skipper? Not bad. Got some fine new equipment. Things go all right here? Fine. We've been doing some night flying from the carrier. Last week, we had joint exercises with the army off... Is something wrong? Off your feed or something? Huh? No. No, no. I'm all right. Uh... what were you saying about maneuvers? Look, Bill, you and I have been shipmates for a long time. We've flown through some tough spots together. Now, something's got you. If I'm stepping onto the wrong side of the quarterdeck, say so, but I wish you'd tell me what's wrong. Lorna's gone away. What? For long, Bill? Maybe for good. I don't know. But... that doesn't make sense. What happened? I don't know. Something while I was away. This is a tough business, Dusty. Maybe I've taken some at home with me nights. She's... she's all mixed up. Changed. Well, I guess you don't feel like talking shop now. I'll run along. Yeah? Mr. Drake, Lieutenant Commander Rhodes wish to see you in the lounge. All right. Thank you. You wanted to see me? Drake, this isn't a very pleasant piece of business... about the touchiest most of us have ever been through in the navy. But we got to have it out with you. Have what out? Go ahead. Lorna Gary left for the east today. She did? You didn't know that? No. You saw a lot of her the past two weeks. Yeah. Every day, almost. And almost every evening. She didn't see anyone else around the station... any of the wives who are her friends here in the squadron. I know she didn't. What about it? It wasn't a pleasure trip Mrs. Gary took today. We don't know when she's coming back. We don't know that she is coming back. Hey, what is this? What are you getting at? What have I got to do with it? Drake, I've cruised with Bill Gary a good while. I was best man at his wedding. I've never seen two people happier than they were... up to two weeks ago, and I've never seen a man busted up so badly as he is today. Do you know why Mrs. Gary left? No, I don't know why, and I don't think it's any of my business, or any of yours. Wait a minute! Don't get on your high horse. Why shouldn't I? You people suspecting me of a thing like this. We are suspecting you, and we've got to find out one way or the other. and if we're right, you don't belong in Bill Gary's squadron. and how does he feel about it? The Skipper? He doesn't know anything about it, and he's not going to find out. Nobody's going to know. Get me? No scandal. Bill's taken enough. Bill Gary's been my Skipper as well as yours, and he's been my friend. You're right. He's never going to know... and you don't have to bother finding out Whether your suspicions are right or wrong, because I'm getting out. I wouldn't fly with a crowd who could suspect me of a filthy trick like this if it was the last squadron in the fleet! You can have my share! You can take the Hellcats and... drown them in the bay. Well, what about it? What do you all think? I don't know. Me, I don't know, either. He didn't deny it, did he? That's good enough for me. I'm not willing to defend a man who's not willing to defend himself. Well, maybe I know a little bit more about this than anyone... except Drake, and I say I don't want to see him or speak to him or fly with him again. He's written his own ticket. All right. Come in. What's this? It's my resignation, sir. I'm getting out of the navy. Getting out? Why, Pensacola, when you checked in here, you loved the navy. You sat right there in that chair one morning and told me you'd sooner fly with us than eat... and you still would, for my money. Come on, tear this thing up. I have no intention of tearing it up, sir. Something's really eating you. Want to tell me? Oh, none of my business, eh? All right, no questions asked. You've got the makings of a great pilot, Drake. The navy can use you, and I still think you love the service. There's a lot more to it than you've learned here in these two weeks. There's loyalty, for one thing, and loyalty isn't a one-way street. It goes both ways... Down as well as up. You fight like blazes for the Skipper, and the Skipper fights like blazes for the men... but we're all fighting for the same thing... The navy... which is, when the chips are down, America's front line. You get discouraged sometimes, sure. You get cold and wet... and so tired you have nothing to hang on with but your teeth. You wonder why in the devil you ever wanted wings, but as you're circling the carrier waiting for your turn to land, and the flagship hoists the signal "well done, fighting 8," It does something to you inside. Duty well done... For a man, that's the best in the book! I've submitted my resignation, sir. Just what is the matter, Drake? Hellcats too tough for you? Ok, sir. Let it go at that. The department hasn't been approving resignations for reserve ensigns. However, if you insist... I do, sir. I'll forward it to Washington... but we've got a movement order here... extensive maneuvers off the coast, probably several weeks. You can't get away before that. That's a good finish, sir. Boy, am I piling up hours. I'm forgetting how to walk. I'm so tired I can't see. I've been wearing a chute for so many hours, my stern feels like a waffle. I'm glad these two weeks are over. They're getting tougher and tougher. We must be part of the war and don't know it, the way they're working us... Day and night, day and night. I don't know what you fellas are so tired about. Look at me. Very funny. Ha ha! Hey, you birds are tired. Join the navy and see the world... through a bomb sight. This may not be war, but it sure isn't heaven. How's the java holding out? It's all right, if you'll come and get it. Combat flying ain't so hot. Keeps your stomach in a constant state of astonishment. Fighting 8, mechanics... Start all engines. Fighting 8, mechanics... Start all engines. Fighting 8... Aye, aye. Did you hear what I heard? A seaplane is down somewhere near the lower California coast. No report for more than two hours. Her radio must be out if she's still afloat, and there's just one hour till darkness. Well, what are we waiting for? Here we go again! Drake. You only came on these maneuvers while waiting for your resignation to be acted on. The maneuvers are over now. This is an extra trip. You can stay on board. You're all in. You're all mixed up, Skipper. I'm resigning, not quitting. All pilots, fighting 8... Man your planes. Commander aircraft from Commander fighting 8. Fighting 8 calling, sir. Commander aircraft... Aye, aye. Go ahead, fighting 8. Fighting 8 took off from carrier to search. Flying east 1,000 feet. Speed 300. Form scouting line. Report anything sighted. Destroyer patrols are in search area. You are not to attempt rescue. Fighting 8... Aye, aye. Fighting 8 from Commander, fighting 8... Form scouting line by section. Interval 3 miles. Execute. We'll make one more sweep. Fly due west 5 miles. Watch your gas. Don't answer. Baby, if that ain't a welcome rumble! Sounds like a fighting squadron. Lay you a cold beer it's the Hellcats. Make it a hot scotch, and you've got a bet! Ha ha! Better fire a star. They may pass us. Only got one left. Shoot the works. We might not get another chance. Skipper, I just saw A veering star to the southern. Change course to south. Fly at 500. Keep close lookout for lights or plane on water. Report anything sighted. Don't answer. They're headed this way. Light a flare! Aye, aye, sir. Commander aircraft from Commander fighting 8. Go ahead, fighting 8. Dby-6 located. North tangent guadalupe island, Bearing 5-0, distance 3 miles. Hull still watertight. All on board safe. Will reach reported position in 15 minutes. Destroyer will arrive within an hour. Carrier in heavy fog. Fog enveloping entire coast. Proceed San Diego without delay. Answer. Fighting 8... Aye, aye. Proceeding San Diego. Planes in sight of me, close up. Others proceed San Diego. Fog shutting in. Don't answer. Disregard my movements. Motor quit. No planes attempt to land. Get started for San Diego, Dusty. There's no gas to spare. Plane 4... Aye, aye. We'll start the minute you're safely down. Plane two... Carry out orders. No planes land. Watch that beach, Skipper. It's a tough one to chute downwind. North Island tower from fighting 8, North Island tower from fighting 8... Squadron Commander forced down at Guadalupe island. Injured. Drake in plane two landed safely. Plane 4, Rhodes. Plane 4... Aye, aye. How badly is he hurt? Bad head injury. I can't do much with first aid. Do you think he could hold out Until the destroyer gets there with a doctor? No. I'll have to fly him back. I'll pull out my radio and take him aboard. Well, step on it, then. Fog reported rolling in at San Diego fast. Fog? Tell the station to break out Spike Knowles and get the transmitter working... Jerry's fog device! I've got the receiving panel here in my ship. It's a chance, but we may have to take it. Ok. We'll wait and go in with you. Now, get this. When I pull out this radio, I can't do any more talking. Right. All planes, take position on Drake. He has the landing device. We'll go in with him. North Island tower from fighting 8, North Island tower from fighting 8... We're bringing in Bill Gary. Please advise weather. Wind northwest 10. Heavy fog. Visibility zero. Ceiling zero. 12 planes fighting 8 landed safely before fog shut down. Have chief radioman Knowles get landing device ready... Banning's fog device. We've got to get the Skipper down somehow! Aye, aye. Get a mike with a long lead so they can talk from fighting 8's hangar. Aye, aye! Come on, Knowles. You know more about this than any one of us. For Pete's sakes, Spike, get it working! They must be just about out of gas. Worked all right last time we tried it, sir, but it sure has conked out on us now. Maybe there's a short somewhere. Check your wiring. Fighting 8, fighting 8... We'll have it going in a minute. How are you fixed for gas? In just a minute, there won't be any gas. Dusty, we're not having much luck. You may have to bail out. Bail out? What about the Skipper? Pensacola's got the Skipper. He can't bail out! Here you are, Spike. Try these. It's working! We're going to let down through it. Keep closed up on Pensacola. Here they come. Great job, Spike! Wonderful! You did it! They're down! Guess I better get me an aspirin. There's Lorna. How is he? How he pulled through the operation last night is a miracle. If he'd only regain consciousness, I'd give him a fighting chance. Lorna. Bill. You got my letter? Yes. You're not going to leave the navy, Bill. I will... if it will make you happy. I'm happy. You've pulled through. I'm home beside you. Do tears help? He's made it. He's going to pull through. Pensacola. While driving with Lorna from the airport, I found out a few things That made me plenty sick of myself and what we've done. I want to apologize for myself and everyone here. It's a little late for apologies, isn't it? Yeah. Pretty late and pretty empty. Maybe not too late. Washington's turned down your resignation. We're going to be flying together for a long time. Perhaps we can make it up to you. I'll apply for a transfer. I wouldn't blame you, but I think we can kill that transfer. The way you handled yourself through this thing and kept your mouth shut... You're a born Hellcat, and we're going to hang on to you. Come on, Pensacola, give in. We need a fella like you. Come on! Ha ha! Come on, Pensacola, you can't leave us now!
