We're just scared that science will be steamrolled. - For good reason. Yeah, because we have so many examples of it heading into this. Take your pick. The institutions which you have previously trusted, the EPA, for example, is willing to take climate change off its website. The administration can perturb those federal agencies, so why not the FDA? There are a lot of people worried about this, Jon.

It was--the idea was doing things precisely, accurately, quickly. That's why I just thought of Warp Speed, was just finding ways that we could remove dead space from the vaccine development process and try to engage the vaccine manufacturers more. - You have a lot of pride in the FDA, obviously, and its reputation. - Yeah. - My sense is you also feel a sense of responsibility to be the guardian at the gate and to not let things through that shouldn't get through, and you have this possibility that if a company asks for an Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine, Trump is gonna give it to them overnight, and the FDA isn't-- - It ain't gonna happen overnight. It ain't gonna happen on my watch. We can't just, like, rush a vaccine along. That could be really dangerous. - So if Trump takes over and says, "To hell with the FDA. This is ready. Let's go." What are you gonna do? - What would I do? Probably hand in my resignation with a letter basically saying that this is just not possible. - I hope you'd come to me also and let me do a story... [chuckles] To break the story. - You can be my guest. - My selfish interest. - Yeah, well, but that's why I've been-- that's why I've been willing to be a little bit risky here if they try to jack anything through. - Yeah. - We're trying to make sure that the public has confidence as much as they can. Public health agencies are dropping like flies in the United States, and I think we're trying to do a reasonable job here of building the FDA as a place where anything that comes through our process is safe and effective, because if people aren't-- if they're not feeling comfortable enough to roll up their sleeve at the end of the day, any vaccine is a failure.

So that's the big unknown. The fastest way to get the answer as to whether the vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and effective is to do formal clinical trials. The phase one clinical trial is the initial test of a new vaccine or a new drug. It's often done in a small number of individuals. The primary goal is to show that the new intervention is safe and raises the type of immune responses that we believe are important. If that hurdle is cleared, then there will be permission to expand into larger-scale studies. - Large numbers of volunteers, 1,000 or tens of thousands, are broken into two groups.

We, the University of Oxford, will not make a profit from this vaccine during the pandemic.

The WHO is calling for countries to sign up to its development program COVAX. - COVAX focuses on little and lower-income countries that cannot fully afford COVID-19 vaccines. - We must all pull together because we cannot afford to fail. - The fastest route to ending the pandemic and accelerating the global economic recovery is to ensure some people are vaccinated in all countries, not all people in some countries.

You would deal with all the health care workers. That should be enough to at least dampen the pandemic by the end of 2021.

If you want to go back to commerce, tourism, trade, movement, students coming in, et cetera, you will not be able to do that if the epidemic's raging in other countries.

An equally massive effort unfolded in China. But China is not waiting for the results before widely using the vaccines at home. Hundreds of thousands of people have received its vaccines. - China has really tried aggressively to enter this space in this pandemic both to reverse the narrative about itself in this pandemic, but also to put itself as a innovator and a country that can master this technology. - The country where the pandemic begun has done a thorough job suppressing transmissions by forcing entire cities to quarantine. In countries unable or unwilling to impose such hardline restrictions, the pandemic is burning out of control. - The United States leads the world in cases, followed by India and Brazil, while the UK and Europe also report new waves of mortalities. With winter weather pushing people to socialize indoors, the virus could spread even more rapidly. - Johnson & Johnson's vaccine trial just reached phase three with the largest group of participants so far of any trial at 60,000 participants. - The study will be run mainly in the U.S. but also in South America in six countries, as well as South Africa. - It's a study of importance level that cannot even be measured. - There is an electricity in the air right now with our volunteers who are just not doing this for themselves, but for the bigger picture. - J&J has committed to mass producing and delivering this vaccine on a nonprofit basis. You absolutely are welcome to emphasize that with the participants. - That's certainly something our participants always want to talk about because they're not doing this for themselves. - That is public knowledge. - They're doing it for the global public health. I talk to them sometimes, and I say, you know, "You are gonna help us figure out "what dose we might use in the vaccine that might end up going to a billion people." Like, just think about that. Like, you as an individual, we may never have this much impact in our lives again. - Yeah. - Yeah. - We don't have any data yet from them, of course. The trials are ongoing, but we think a single shot vaccine is a very promising option.

We can vaccinate almost half of the health care workers. ♪ ♪ Ian's just phoned me, and he says that there's a riot. They've had to pull in the police at Berea, and we worry that we're gonna run out of vaccines there. ♪ ♪ There's a lot of them. It's, like, crowded. Like, now they're starting to queue. Police everywhere. That's insane. Well, you know, we only have a limited amount of doses left. [indistinct chatter] - In South Africa, we're in this pandemic for three years or more. - Yeah. - We are fucked. We are fucked. - Why? Why are you-- why is it so bleak? - We underestimated the virus. COVID-19 is actually now the leading cause of death in South Africa over HIV and TB. - Really? Wow, wow. That's sobering. - It is a logistical nightmare to get 67% of the population vaccinated. - Even if you have supply, even if you have vaccine. - I don't think there's gonna be an issue of demand. It's always gonna be an issue of supply. ♪ ♪ - I am fully immunized. - Great, and so am I. - What are we doing? Is it hoarding? Is it fair to call it hoarding? - It's disgraceful that health care workers globally do not have access to safe and effective vaccines, and that really represents a collective failure. You know, another example of complacency that occurred between the last crisis and this one. It's like a no-win situation because if you state that you're gonna donate a portion of the U.S. supply, you're gonna make a lot of people unhappy, and a lot of people will expect more as well and say, "That's not enough." - Let's to switch to the COVAX facility. - The goal is 2 billion doses, right, by the end of the year. There has been the generosity on the part of many countries to providing money, but nowhere near enough. A lot of countries that had the money jumped in the queue and placed orders for vaccines with all of these companies. That undercuts COVAX because the idea is global, equitable allocation, and so that's been a real frustration that they haven't been able to get access to vaccines yet when other countries have. - Why not give the vaccines to COVAX now? - Those decisions are being assessed and being assessed every day. - Are you lobbying for that? Do you believe in that? - I believe in making sure that we have as much vaccine to get Americans vaccinated and get the world vaccinated. - But there's a push right now, David. There are doctors and nurses dying, and we have covered our doctors and nurses in this country. If they want a vaccine, they can have a vaccine. - Well, I want to get to the point where we're making vaccine in this country for the world. That is a goal. - Because right now it's India that is making vaccine for the world. - Right, and what did India do today? - They blocked exports. - Right. - You must be pulling your hair out about India. Are you gonna have trouble hitting your target for COVAX members? - It is likely now that we will. Everybody says they want vaccine equity, but not everybody's acting like they want vaccine equity. The Serum Institute of India did a deal with us, I have to say, in good faith. Unfortunately, that's been superseded by government controls, so that has broken down completely. [dramatic orchestral music] ♪ ♪ - As India continues its devastating battle against a raging outbreak, the country's prime minister has temporarily banned exports of COVID-19 vaccines so that all doses can be used in-country. ♪ ♪ - Thank you so much. - Nice to meet you. Thank you for having me. It's very kind of you. - Yes, okay. There we go. - Are you comfortable with me taking my mask off? - Please do. - Okay, thank you. - Go ahead. - The government in India said it's a short delay. It's not an export ban. Do you--do you agree with this decision, or are you being forced to make this decision? - These decisions have been made by the government of India, which have been rightly made, and I support those decisions based on the need in India. See, their perspective is that, look, we want to help the world. We are helping the world, but we need to protect our people first. - The government isn't taking over the company? - Not as yet because I've agreed to what they want to do. - If you disagree? - If I disagree, I will be nationalized, and we don't want to do that. - Really? - And even they don't want to do it. - They could do that? - I don't think they want to. I'm just joking, but-- - Well, are there government people here making sure that you're not exporting stuff to places? - I won't comment on that. I really can't, but let's leave it at that. - But the goal of 274 million doses in COVAX by the end of May-- - That's not gonna happen. No, without me, essentially, COVAX would fail. We have signed contracts of 240 million doses for the AstraZeneca product with COVAX. - Mm-hmm. - And we're in the process of signing more contracts, but of course, national interest always supersedes all contractual obligations. What we have to do is in the interest of our nation and the world, and right now, our nation needs us, and I don't want that to be the situation. I want, and I plead with other vaccine manufacturers to provide more doses to COVAX so that the pressure for me is off. - So what should Pfizer and Moderna... - Short and simple. - What should Pfizer and Moderna have sold it-- - Sacrifice profits. They are for profit. I am for profit and philanthropy, and that is the distinct difference between Serum Institute of India and every other vaccine company on this planet. That's in a nutshell. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - The public sector has invested billions in development of vaccine candidates, but it's the private sector that will rake in the cash. - This will be one of the biggest profit possibilities in literally a generation for these companies. ♪ ♪ - Even as vaccines bring hope to some, they become another brick in the wall of inequality between the world's haves and have nots. - Pfizer is forecasting $15 billion in revenue from its COVID vaccine. - Moderna created three new billionaires this year, CEO Stéphane Bancel. He is now worth over $4 billion. - Those who have vaccines are getting better significantly, and they're opening up their society. Those who don't have vaccines are facing serious surges in cases and deaths due to COVID. ♪ ♪ - Companies are rejecting requests by manufacturers in developing countries to share the recipes and know-how so that they can solve the severe shortages. ♪ ♪ - The fact that the vaccine recipe is a secret even as we are facing unprecedented vaccine shortages is a moral stain. - The differences between the haves and the have nots is now completely exposing the unfairness of our world. - There have been unprecedented statements said by corporations in terms of access, but when you really boil it down, it's actually still business as usual. - [sobbing] - [sobbing] - The injustice, the inequality. Just give us the vaccines. ♪ ♪ - Dr. Tedros. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me. - Thank you. Thank you for having me. - I want to ask you about your own vaccination. You got your first shot when? - You know, still I feel like I know where I belong, in a poor country called Ethiopia, in a poor continent called Africa, and wanted to wait until Africa and other countries in other regions, low-income countries, start vaccination. So I was protesting, in other words, because we're failing. I saw global failures like HIV, and these are the things I remember when we were confronted with COVID. - Why do you think it is that there are so few world leaders who are willing to say, "I'm gonna be blunt "and call this a catastrophic moral failure. "I'm going to say it is grotesque to have a gap between 12-year-old being vaccinated--" and you never say, "In the United States," but I can fill in the blank. I live there. "We must do more," they say or think, but they don't call it what it is. Why not? - [chuckles] I mean, that's the question I wanted an answer for actually because a shared responsibility is just something you would expect from a decent human being. When the whole world is burning, it's about humanity. - I imagine you have been on the phone with leaders of vaccine companies. - I encourage them to help. - And what was the reaction? - [sighs] It's the same response, the same argument. You know, it's unprecedented actually to have a number of vaccines approved in just a year, but that still saddens me because I know what happened in the past, and that's happening now on our watch again, and, you know, this question comes, "When do we learn? When?" ♪ ♪ The development and approval of vaccines in record time took us to the summit of scientific achievement. The question that every person on Earth is asking now is how and when will we end this pandemic? We have the knowledge and tools to do it, including vaccines, but around the world, many other countries are now facing a surge in cases, and they're facing it without vaccines. Above all, at the root of the pandemic is a deficit of solidarity and sharing, sharing of data, sharing of information, sharing resources, sharing technology and tools that every nation needs to keep its people safe. We're in the race of our lives, but it's not a fair race, and most countries have barely left the starting line. ♪ ♪ You know, Jon Cohen, a science journalist is with me today, and he was telling me about, "Tomorrow is a long time." I think that could be a very important message to do things today and to do things now. Tomorrow is a long time. I think we have to do everything with that mentality. Thank you so much.
