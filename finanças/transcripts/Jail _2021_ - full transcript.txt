'Wear your mask properly Maintain social distance' 'Wash your hands frequently' 'Take your vaccine on your turn Let us eradicate Corona' 'No animals or birds were harmed during the making of this film' Hello, everyone. Slum clearance... is getting rid of people living in the slums. Isolating these people is what happens here. This is the biggest housing board built by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board. This is Kaveri Nagar. Kaveri Nagar in OMR-Thoraipakkam... is well known in Chennai. The story of Kaveri Nagar, is a story of deceit. Kaveri Nagar is about 30km from Chennai city. These people, who hail from various parts of the city... ...the real residents of Chennai, ...are locked away like refugees here. All these people are daily wagers. They work as domestic help, sell fish, drive auto rickshaws, etc. The displacement has taken their incomes away... ...thereby the education of their children. For medical emergencies... ...they still depend on the Royapettah Govt. Hospital. Their new houses should have been built at or around their existing homes. The politicians took money to clear the slums along the river banks where they lived... and gave the land to corporate companies, shopping malls, and private medical colleges. Right now, Kaveri Nagar houses... ...close to 250,000 people. Many sold their houses to continue living in the streets. It's like snatching a bird from its nest and locking it up in a cage. This is their life today. The police have declared Kaveri Nagar, as a Prime Crime Zone. They are monitored 24x7 like prisoners. There are CCTV cameras everywhere. From their perspective, this is a... ' JAIL ' Come, let's go into their lives and see what it's like. ' KARNA ' Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? Bro, I'll get down at Kaveri Nagar. Keep going! Going to Kaveri Nagar? I got you, brother. Just one stop away, ma'am he'll be out soon. Okay. Please don't mind, ma'am. Madam, you work for an IT company, is it? Yes. You'd get about 50-100 thousand, a month? Hmm. What a life, brother! We live in the same city but we can barely make a hundred bucks. These folks come here and make hundreds of thousands. Isn't that right, bro? I'm burning my back driving this everyday, and for what? 300 bucks. What do we do? They are fans of the government that chased us away. These days, it's so easy to set up an IT Company. Everything is free. But try getting a loan to buy an auto rickshaw? "Get me, that. Get me, this" and what not? They drive us nuts, bro! Let it go, bro! Why talk about our stinky lives? My my, do you smell the perfume? It's getting the vehicle high! Hello, can I get your number? Are you seriously hitting on me? - Please stop the auto now. - Wait wait... Did you just abuse me? You think we locals are scumbags? I'll stab you and then cut you into pieces. - Brother, please don't. - Shall I do it? Bro let her go. She ran her mouth by mistake. The mere sight of us makes you run your mouth, eh? - I'll scrape your tongue out. - Sorry, brother. She made a mistake. Let it go, bro. What do you mean "let it go"? She questioned my birth. I can't let it go. Wait, till I slice your mouth away! Sorry brother! It was a mistake. What? Brother? Who is your brother? Sorry, sir. My bad, sir. Who said you can call me "Sir"? Sorry brother. No no, sir. Alright. Pay me your fine for slandering. - Give me your phone. - It's an iPhone! It's worth 50 thousand. And I... shall take the iPhone. - It's just a phone, let it go. - Get going. That's Karna. A small time thief. But he gets beaten up by cops, like he's a big time criminal. Don't cry, Karna. Don't cry. It's okay, it's okay. Sir... Sir! What now? Get me a smoke, sir! Shall I get you some liquor as well? That's up to you, sir! If you did, you'd be my guardian angel. Haven't you had enough with the beating? Sir, my body aches from the beating. My throat hurts. I'll take a few puffs to easy my pain. Just get me one, sir. Come on, boy. This isn't right. - I'm not supposed to... - Just one, sir. Please. Sir... Who's going to light it? That too? Such is my life. ' RAAKI ' What's up, mate? Here to pray? Well, no... I heard they sell 'packets' here. What packets? Chief, I mean joints. The dope. I have a packet of holy ash, feel free to pray and take it. Bro, 'Beeda Shop' Durai sent me over. Beeda Shop Durai? You should always mention the name first. You think I sell candies that I can handover immediately? Such amateurs! Give me a hundred. Hundred? It's only 50 bucks on ECR. Go ahead and get it there. Bro, hold on... Don't get pissed. Give me a hand. Brother... The 50 bucks stuff is crap. I've got the 'real' stuff for you. - Ask me how... - How? The original stuff - 'Idukki Gold'. Certified original stuff. Look now... Isn't it brown? Take a close look at it... See that it's green? Looks brown from afar... and green up close. This is how you know it's good stuff. - Get it? - Get this... Why did you hit me? We were just talking! Couldn't you tell from the slap that I am a certified cop? Damn you cops! Come on, guys! If you don't let us do our business, how will the nation grow? India will grow once you scumbags disappear. Meet Raaki from the Two-Storey Gang of Kaveri Nagar. This is his sister, Maria Pushpam. Raaki is big fish in his business. And he learnt the trade from... This is not a hand. It's a gun! A gun? If any of them dare to mess with me... Bam, bam, bam! I'll just shoot them and walk away. Looks like your gun isn't loaded these days? Raaki has just one rival. Manickam aka Manick. Kaveri Nagar's Three-Storey Gang. He came to Kaveri Nagar from Pudhupettai in the year 2000. "Don't you dare mess with me I'll force you down the sea" "I'll twist your hands and feet I'll tear your face down." "Don't pick a fight with us Or it will be the end of you." That's Manick. The brave soldier of the ruling party. - Leader, bless us. - Welcome, boss! His confidante, Kaliyan. They also sell pot for a living. The two gangs are perpetually at war. Who gets to sell here and live here... is decided by government and authority. Like seeds that shoot up into plants amidst all the filth... Raaki and Manick rose up. Raaki wants to kill Manick. And Manick wants to kill Raaki. To tackle the increasing crime rate, they setup a new police station in Kaveri Nagar. Custodial deaths, petrol bomb attacks... this police station has seen it all. A robbery case, sir. A chain-snatching case, from OMR. FIR has been filed. "Three youth from Kaveri Nagar arrested." The boss wants that as the headline. We did nothing, sir! I was there for painting work. We know everything. These guys... - I'll take leave, sir. - Sure, see you! - Mr. Devaraj, keep me posted on previews. - Sure. Sir, I need a conduct certificate. Can I meet the inspector? He will be here soon. Wait there. The inspector has been in the station for two hours now. What is he doing, sir? He's handling a high pressure job. Sit there and wait. Dude, what's happening inside? He probably ate beans, looks like it's 'Fast and Furious' in there. It's fireworks inside. Dude, stop laughing or he'll beat us up. You know him, right? Why did you laugh? Sir... it's nothing. Come on, why did you guys laugh? Nothing, sir. I won't hit you. Tell me why. For the last 2 hours, you were inside the toilet. It was like an action film with DTS sound. It was pretty amazing, sir. Fascinating sounds, sir. What's the issue? Well, it's piles. Piles? Piles is known in Tamil as "Moolam". "Moolam"? There are two kinds. External and internal piles. I suffer from internal piles. Anal canal blocked with a huge growth. No matter how hard I squeeze, no shit comes out. Only blood. You think it's funny? Should I show you how much it hurts? - No, sir. - Shall I show it to you? Let me show you. You laughed, right? You crooks! Now watch me... People out here deal with pokes and strokes in the back... - You guys find it funny? - Sir, don't. What happened, sir? Why were they near the toilet? I thought these accused guys can sit in the back. - You enjoy embarrassing me. - Nothing like that, sir. What do you mean, no? Be happy! - You think it is funny? - Sorry, sir! You idiots, what did you ask him? We didn't say anything, sir! He's here. Previously, Inspector Perumal was posted at Pondy Bazaar station. He made money in every possible way. The commissioner office received many complaints on him. He got suspended for taking a bribe. And got his job back by paying a bribe. He didn't lie low in Kaveri Nagar either. He is raking in the moolah by taking money from both gangs. Perumal is corrupted, yes! But he's a terror. He had Kaveri Nagar completely under his control. 'KALAI' Ma... Bro, stop the vehicle. Hold on boy. Driver, stop the vehicle. - What happened, son? - Stop the vehicle. Brother, stop the vehicle. Ma... Ma! Kalai... Ma! Ma! My precious! - Hey, Velamma! - Yes, brother? - Isn't that your son, Kalai? - Yes, he just got released. - Uncle Muthu! - How are you, Kalai? I'm fine, uncle. So many years, for what? Stealing two candy bars. Damn them and their laws. Don't worry. I've filed a case at the World Court. This government will have to give answers for relocating us here. Disaster resettlement in India. Don't worry. I'll see you around. His name is Muthu Karuppan. During the evacuation of the Saidapet Slums... he tried setting himself ablaze to protest. He was saved though. He's a social activist. Come in... look at your father. Dad... He worked so hard to make a living and spent it all on liquor. With twitching limbs, and no one around to help... ...he's curled up in a corner. I didn't want to bother you with it, so I didn't say anything. Dad... It's me, Kalai. Dad! You asked to see your son before you die, right? Now, you'll die in peace. Dad! Dad... Bowl the ball, man. Calm down, he is bowling. Damn! I'm not able to connect one shot. Dude, wait for it, the next one is a rocket shot! "So Mita Sai Baba." Bowl, dude! Saw that? Raaki's rocket shot! You're going to run all the way to Kasimedu. - Hey, Karna. - Bowl, dude. Which town are they from? - Not sure! - They probably think our hood is heaven. How many more scapegoats are going to be sent here? We should put up a 'House Full' board outside the hood and stop them. Hey, baby! Where are you from? What does it matter to you? Keep going. They're from that area, dude! You got owned! That's a shady area, you wouldn't know. I see! We have a bet match tomorrow. - Let's nail it! Bro, Kalai is back from prison. He's home now. Dude! Hurry up. Kalai! Dude, Kalai! - Dude! - How're you doing? Hands off! What? You forgot us, dude? Who said I forgot? My dad is dying. Mom is picking rags. Did you guys care to check? - You all seem to be doing great! - Come on, dude. What do you mean we didn't care? Your mom screams at us if we offer money! She thinks you were in jail because of us. She's pissed off with us. Go ask your dad. We bathe him once a week. Who do you think got him medicines and his favourite horse-seeds? Not even your mom knows. You think you are his only son? Let it go, dude! Why talk to a guy who doesn't value friendship? Let's go. Let's go. Hop on, kid. Guys, wait! What? I'll get you guys ice candies. Friends? "Not a penny with me, but I sure am wealthy!" "My friends are my fortune, I have plenty!" "He worries for one, like a mother for a son." "He'll be beside me, through the long run." "Lub dub, lub dub goes the heart." "Friendship will never let it fall apart." "Lub dub, lub dub goes the heart." "Friendship will never let it fall apart." "Cares for us like a father and mother." "I won't lose him, where can I find another?" "Not a penny with me, but I sure am wealthy!" "My friends are my fortune, I have plenty!" "He worries for one, like a mother for a son." "He'll be beside me, through the long run." Dude, I'm so happy to see you. Karna, enough with it! My darling, come here! I thought about you all the time. Remember those amazing days in Nochikuppam? - Heaven, dude! - Hide and seek... Playing by the sea... You got your willy stuck in your fly. I can go on, dude! Right, Raaki? Karna... Kalai isn't like us. Our buddy Kalai was the class topper! We would have studied too... if only they'd let us. Those douche bags threw us out. Raaki would have got a job in the Railways through sports quota. I would have sung and danced my way into an orchestra. Our lives are ruined now. You ended up in jail as a kid. We are listed as "Wanted". Dude... Don't hang out with us. We are all thugs. At-least you live a good life. Otherwise, they'll brand you too. You just got out of jail. Don't be around here. Leave. Don't hang out with me, dude! - You should do well. - Dude... - Yeah, don't hang out with us. - You should forget us. This is Papamma. She delivers milk for a living... but she presses her faded sarees... ...and lives a life of dignity. You call this house but nothing is where it should be! What are you looking for, dear? Where could it go? I left it here. What are you raiding the house for? It's not like your husband left behind a fortune. I'm looking for the gift my friend gave me. Which one? The big white one... ...with a picture deity Balaji on the back? "So Mita Sai Baba." Exactly, my angel! Where's the phone, Mom? Get it, please. I'm late. I'll whack you! You stole it from the milk booth agent. You call that a gift? Who do you think you're fooling? Now that you know it, give me the phone. I gave it back to him saying I found it on the ground. Mom! You know the phone is worth 25,000 rupees? You speak as if you earned it. Mom, give it to me. I'll thrash you! Why can't you make a honest living instead of stealing? Look at Mallika's son, Ramesh. He goes to work and lives with dignity. Why can't you be like that? You should be proud that your son fits in. - But look at you, always complaining. - Oh I see... I have seen it all. Someone will come teach you a lesson. You wait, I'll teach you a lesson. Eat something before you go. Idiot. Such a pain. Sir, I studied till 12th grade. I will do any job. Where do you live? Kaveri Nagar. The one in Thoraipakkam? Yes, sir. Kaveri Nagar? No jobs available here! How come you have a board that says you're hiring. Yes, but that is for... Kaveri Nagar guys will rob my place if I hire them. Why would a thief look for work? - We don't hire people from there. - No jobs here. Get going. Dude, take this. Oh no. Hey! Who are you? Who are you? How dare you enter my house? Stop screaming. Mind your tone. How dare you lock my doors and windows? Get out! I'll be out after they leave. - I'll slap you. Get out! - Shut up! Selvam, not here. He'll be down eventually. I'm talking to you, you jerk. Where are you going? - Get out of here! - All this over one laptop. Play your hide and seek game outside my place. I'm not here to molest you. Wait, I am going. Get. Out. Of my house. It's not like I nailed you down. Nail me down? You'll nail me down in my own house? Just wait till I cut you into pieces! Where is the tool box? Calm down! Try coming closer now. I'll cut you into pieces. Are you really trying to scare a gangster like me with a small knife? Get out before I carve your face out. I've got enough scars already. I'm going to kill you, "DVD" guy. What "DVD"? DVD player! I'm a player, alright! Let's play a game. Sure, why not! I've made fish curry. Why don't you rest here? Fish curry? Great, let me change into a lungi. Hey! Idiot! You're dead now! What a devil. I'll get you! Where are you running away? How are you, sister? I'm going for a jog. - Stop it, you thief. - Move it, man! - You half-trousers... - Sister, stop that crazy woman! - Why are you chasing me? - Stop running! You crash into my house. I'm going to trash you, now. Wait up! - Damn, it's them. - Sir, catch him. - Here you are. - Arrest me, sir! Lock me up for any case, sir! Arrest me, sir! If I see you again, I'll cook you alive. - Take me, sir. - We arrest you every week. It's just a waste of money. Look at her staring. Wait till we break your legs one day. Get going, woman. Hey, you! Hi! Is your dad an MLA? How did they let you out so soon? Dealing with cops is child's play to me. Oh, you think you are some big shot? Should I come up? Let's play a game? Damn you, murderer! He's studied till 12th Grade. I've done a check. He is a decent guy. Our customer Anand recommended him. Where are you from? I live in Saidapet, sir. Work diligently, okay? Go ahead. Start working. Thank you, sir. We've been waiting for a long time. Yeah, we have no buses... but there are no share-autos either. Anyone for Kaveri Nagar? Sister, move in. Make space. Going to Kaveri Nagar? Get in, sister. - Are you coming for the movie? - No, I'm not. Are you from Kaveri Nagar? Yes. The manager said you are from Saidapet. Uhm... Nobody hires anyone from Kaveri Nagar. That's why I lied. Please don't rat me out. Hmm. And you are from? Me? T.Nagar. Sister. Das asked to buy some Biriyani. Got cash? - For how much? - Fifteen bucks. Here. Look at that! Our girl has a biriyani shop! She's damn hot! She's got a string of boys guys lined up behind her. Dude, I've already tugged at her strings. She's hot stuff. She's mine! Got it? Okay... How about some biriyani? You'll get the girl. I'll get what? Biriyani? Come on. Hands off. People sacrifice their lives for their friends. Come on. - You come along too, Shorty. - You are such a pain! Hello, there. Selling biriyani, I see. Hello, you crook. You called me a crook? Twisted roads make twisted people. Life lessons. - Good one. - Thanks, mate! - Chicken or Beef? - Pork. I see, no wonder it's sizzling hot. What? Double meaning? Nope. Just one meaning. You disturb my business, and I'll shove it in. - She says she will shove it in! - Is this how you treat customers? Does the biriyani come with chunks of meat? For 15 bucks? You only get 'kuska' rice. Just 'kuska'? Just 'kuska'. Did you expect Anushka then? Ah, Anushka! - She's super hot. - I know, right? Who is the lucky guy? - Who knows. All I know is this one's mine. - Hey! - Three plates of biriyani. First pay up the money. We are not going anywhere. Show me the money before you touch the 'kuska'. Dude, got any money on you? - Now I know why I was invited. - Don't be silly, dude. Give it. You guys are everything to me. Here you go. Give me some biriyani. Look at you grab the plate! Serve some more rice, miss. Here! Just one cup for 15 rupees? Did you expect a bucket? This is all you get for 15 rupees. I gave you 50 rupees, not 15! - Take it. - I need my change! I won't give it to you! Then I won't return the plate. Pour some more. Should I empty it on your head? She's got a big mouth. Shorty, how do you like it? - It's good. - It's average. - Hey! - I was joking, it's good. What about the change? This isn't going to work out. Let's get going. So you quit studying to sell biryani? Why do you keep stirring me up? Because you stir my heart, babe! Double meaning again? Single meaning again. You still didn't answer my question! Why didn't you continue school? Who'll pay for it? Your dad? So you'll go to school if I pay for it? I can tell from your face that you don't have money. Don't look at my face when I offer money. Look at my generous heart. Life lessons. See you around! - Do shower tomorrow. - Fool! Bye! What's up, Zamin? How's the business going? Going good. Super! It this beef rice? - Chicken rice. - I see... Where are we going? There, my sister has come! What's the matter? Want to have beef rice? I don't like beef rice. You don't like it? Fine, do you like the person who is cooking it? I've seen your sister around. So... you like her? I do. Are you pimping me out? Is this why you got me here? Get lost! Sister! Come on... Get here, Raaki! Sister! Look! He's got no bad habits. He wants nothing from you, but you. I'll thrash you. Don't you dare come home. - Well done, sister. - Little punk trying to act grownup. What happened? Failure. Get a take-away from Zamin. We'll need munchies. Dude, keep calm. I'll handle it. Okay? Let's go. Here... How long will you keep saying no to marriage? If I wanted to be married... I would have said yes when Laundry Murugan proposed to me. I can't imagine a life leaving my brother alone. He was a little boy then, he is a grown man now. He wants good things for you. I'll turn Kaveri Nagar upside down for you, just say yes. I can't explain it! If we had a mother, you'd understand. How do I tell my younger brother? Think of me as our mother. My get my periods only once a year. The first doctor I went to said there's a tumour. Another doctor said we'd have to remove my uterus. How can I get married with such complications? What if my in-laws throw me out for being infertile? You think you can bear that? Let me live like this. I'll die someday. Think of me as your mother, and cremate me. Hey! Dude, don't cry. We'll get her treated in one of the rich hospitals. Don't cry! Dude... In a time when parents abandon their own children... look how my sister turned out. She sacrificed her love for me. She's thrown her life away. Why? Don't cry. Please... If my mother was alive, she'd have never let this happen to my sister. It is finally hitting me... we really need our mother. We're all here for you, man! Why do you say that? But who is the mother I knew? Who? It's my sister, dude. She didn't want me to be alone, but she's been so lonely. Is she just a sister to me? She's my mother! Don't cry, dude. I'm going to make my sister's wedding the grandest Kaveri Nagar has ever seen! What do you mean "I"? What am I here for? - WE are going to do it. - We'll make it happen! Let's do this, dude! Done. Good morning, sir! - Good morning! - Check zero, please. What's for lunch today? Curd rice? See you! I've never seen you in Kaveri Nagar. I've been there for 5 years now. What? Actually... they accused me of stealing as a child and put me in jail. Just got out. - For 250. - Got change? - Sir, want a bill? - No need. Move ahead, please. Now that you know I was in jail... ...you don't want to talk to me anymore, right? Not really... My younger brother is in jail too. I was reminded of him. "My scrambled eggs Can I give you a kiss?" "My shredded flatbread Can I devour you?" "My scrambled eggs Can I give you a kiss?" "My shredded flatbread Can I devour you?" "The kohl in your eyes Messes with my heart." "Why do you torment my poor soul?" "The kohl in your eyes Messes with my heart." "Why do you torment my poor soul?" "When you walk closer to me You're like a quarter of booze." "Come quench my thirst Like purified mineral water." "When you walk closer to me You're like a quarter of booze." "Come quench my thirst Like purified mineral water." "My scrambled eggs Can I give you a kiss?" "My shredded flatbread Can I devour you?" "My scrambled eggs Can I give you a kiss?" "My shredded flatbread Can I devour you?" Get away! Why do you always point a knife at me? Here you go! What's this? Cash, dough, money... What for? You wanted to go to school! There are so many children in Kaveri Nagar who don't go to school. Would you sponsor everyone? I'm generous as Karna. I'd give everything to Kaveri Nagar, if I had the money! I know what this money is for! - Take you money and leave. - Don't be stupid. I never got to study. At least one person in the family should be educated. Shut your face! I stopped going to school two years back. I was wearing my sister's uniform yesterday. Oh I see! No wonder the uniform was all tight and hot. So, where is the sister? I might kill you just about now. You better get going! I won't take money once given, and won't return money once taken. Make me your business partner. I'll see you around. "My scrambled eggs." Hey, yellow T-shirt! Wait up. Take your money back. Stop! "My scrambled eggs Can I give you a kiss." "My shredded flatbread." Go on, and dance. The UN will declare the verdict soon. Dance with joy! Kill it, boys! Quick! Get going. How dare you sell dope in our area? Here comes OMR's owner. Should I put up a hoarding for you? Who do you think you are, big mouth? How dare you peddle drugs in our area? This is our zone! - Raaki's already furious with you guys. - What will he do? - If he gets hold of you, you're dead! - Whack him! Ready? "I'll beat you black and blue And bend you backward." Bowl to me. I'm going to slay you guys today. That's an old photo of mine. I should tell them to update it. How did you get there on time? Shorty told me you went alone. - So I came after you. - Dude! I'll sort you out later. Let it go, we'll get them one day. Where is the leader? He said he'd be here. I called him, he is on the way. Turn the car around. - Pandi, how are you? - Good, sir! - Hey, Suresh! - Hello, sir! - Hello, leader. - Come in, sir! - Hello, leader! - Wait here. - How are you doing, Sasi? - I am good, brother. Manick, where is the inspector? - He's inside. - Come with me. Stay here, rest of you. It's become a habit for you guys! Boss, they keep bothering us! - Perumal sir, hello! - Welcome. Come here. Do you have any brains? Don't know how to speak to an officer? - You thought I am your servant? - No, leader. Let's go. - What happened, sir? - Go and ask your inspector. Now you know our clout? See you around. - I'm going to smash his mouth in. - Buzz off. Get going, fool. Keep walking. These days we can commit pretty much any crime. As long as we're part of a political party, or start one. Then let's start one. Start one? What do we call it? Karna, Raaki Welfare Association? Sounds good. Let's add your mom's name as well! No, she already talks way too much! Make sure my birthday celebration is nice and grand, okay? - Of course, leader! - I'll see you around. Boys, he's letting you go. Get going. - Can we leave? - Yes, get going. - How come? - You know him, right? Not again! Get going. - Sir, we never got that biryani we ordered. - Why don't I home deliver it? Cocky! We pay him money too, right? That's why he let us go! Oh, shut up. We never got even for a broken head. Dude, they've literally broken your skull. - How many stitches? - 12. Look what they've done to him. Say something! - Dude, not now. After the elections. - Damn with the elections. I'll crack their shells and feed you brain curry. Let's go. Calm down, dude. Let's do it together. I'll take care of it. Come on, buddy. Don't be so pissed! Brother, chicken gravy for 20 rupees. Eggs for 10 rupees. Girl, get me another egg! - This one's your second. - Okay, fine! - What? - One plate rice and an egg. Dude, what's with her? Yesterday, she had only one board. Today there is three. Looks like her business is booming. What did you do, Karna? So Mitta Sai Baba! I can't tell you. It's the secret to picking up a chick. Brother, here you go! 'Desappan Biryani Stall' Who is this guy? Don't be disrespectful. He's my dad! I see you're sentimental about your daddy. I've set aside some biryani for you. Want to eat? - Awwww! - What "Awwww"? I made the egg and chicken curry using your money. It turned out good. Everything got sold! Oh, I see. - You pitched in too. - Indeed. Which means you're my partner. Here is your share. Save up this money. It'll be handy for the wedding. Whose wedding? Our wedding. Excuse me? - Don't dream about getting married to me. - Oh, really? I will marry a guy who works in IT and settle down in America. American dream in your egg curry, I see. - Of course, what did you expect? - A bit too much. When we were in Ayodhi Kuppam, we had a stall in Marina beach. There was a guy with an Audi car who drooled over me. Audi car? He even had a tattoo with my name. He got your name inked? But I still turned him down, you know? Why did you turn him down, Miss World? He had no hair. He was bald. I've got a full head of hair though. Yes, but do you have an Audi car? I've got no Audi car, but when I dance, I'm an all-star. - Get going. - Hey, Malar! Hey! "Miss or Missus?" "Miss or Missus?" Hi! "Sassy, slinky, saucy, fancy This girl that I fell for." "Brothers, buddies and my boys Hear this gaana-western fusion." "Caught in the feeling I'm oozing poetry." "Intoxicated in this narrow street I'm scheming ways to woo you." "She's the one for me." "Put on your fancy shirt, dude I'm getting married." "Am I lucky or what? Oh, the look she threw me" "I landed this bombshell as my lover." "Miss or Missus?" "Miss or Missus?" "The nightingale of housing board She cusses like a sailor" "I swooned at her expletives I gotta marry her." "Miss or Missus?" "Miss or Missus?" "She's like gizzard curry She's buzzing with energy." "Every snap of her fingers Can charge a phone." "She's made herself a home In my heart." "Oh, girl with the mole Boil me like turmeric in water." "My love for you pours out Like tap from water." "Make me a chunky meat In your 'kuska' rice, dear." "Scram, boy Just get out." "You're a swine I'm solid." "Your antics won't work here" "I'm original teak You're fake" "I'll smash your nose" "I'm the power You're sugar." "Why can't I touch you?" "You fizzy drink Come bloom for me" "I'll build you a tower of love" "I'm a don You're quite the scene." "Hop onto my van." - Oh, no. Run! - Catch him. "My love is strong Like beef tailbone soup." "Babe, we're strong as the Fort Our life's rock solid" "I'll earn a living pedaling rickshaw And you'll live like a queen." "You'll lead a fancier life Than the Queen in London" "I have a yellow sacred thread Ready for our wedding" "I'm like the Rama to you, Sita Pick me already." "Sassy, slinky, saucy, fancy This girl that I fell for." "Brothers, buddies and my boys Hear this gaana-western fusion." "Caught in the feeling I'm oozing poetry." "Intoxicated in this narrow street I'm scheming ways to woo you." "Miss or Missus?" "Miss or Missus?" He is such a nasty guy. Don't waste your time talking about him. I'll sort him out someday. Hey, Kaliyan! It fell right on the head, right? You moron! We gave it back to you, didn't we? - I'm coming for you. - Come at us. Get up, dude! - Let's break them into pieces. - Don't let them get away! Dude, run. Go, go, go. If they catch us, we'd be minced meat. We'll be gone by then. Get the ladder from there! Put it up. Hold tight. - Dude, let's jump. - Are you crazy? - We'll crack all our bones. - They'll rip us apart anyway, just jump. Climb up, take my hand. Come on. This way. You think you can run away? Raaki, if I catch you, you are dead! Safe landing! "Catch me if you can!" I won't spare you. Dude, run! I will rip you guys into pieces! Let's have a party tonight! No way! I didn't see any news on TV. Get my towel! Here you go, leader! You are always on your phone! So, Manickam... Yes, leader! Taking this to the police... ...registering a complaint... why go through all the trouble? - It'll go on forever. - Okay, leader. Just finish him off. - What say? - Fair enough, leader. Manickam probably pressured the counsellor, now the inspector will warn us. No, you don't have to come here. I'll send. Hey. The guy who got hurt, Kaliyan, hasn't complained. No call from the counselor either. - What does that mean? - Well, sir... You've probably got two days before they put up your obituaries. Sir, we won't let that happen. - Not if we beat them to it. - Yes, sir! Why are you always picking fights? Won't you try and make a life for yourselves? Go now! - See you, sir. - See you. - Raaki... - Sir? Dude, wait for me. So, Raaki... - Let's get going! - What did Perumal say? I can't talk about it now, but I'll tell you soon. Here, eat! My mother made it. - I don't cook so well. - Thought as much! That's why I asked. Just eat now, will you? Who is she? She's my girl. She runs a biriyani stall near the 4-storey building. - What's your name? - Rosa Malar. You look so beautiful, are you sure you are in love with him? Take your hands off me. I'm talking here! - You could have done better. - He manage to woo me somehow. - You mongrel. - Why did you hit me, Ma? You've got yourself a lovely girl. Now lead a good life. I'll take care of it. Make him do the dishes at your stall. He'll learn something. Ma, stop talking. Take your daughter-in-law's blessings. - Why did you hit me? - I have to get her blessings. Such a nice daughter-in-law. May you be blessed? Great! Karna? What happened, sister? Where is Raaki? His phone isn't reachable either. I've also been trying for last 3 days! He never goes anywhere without informing me. Don't be worried. I'll take care. I have a bad feeling about this. Go home, sister. Thank you, sir! Sir, fill 5 liters of petrol. Your first salary, is it? You are not going to treat me? Consider it done. Dude, have you seen Raaki? We're looking for him too. He said he'd come for a bet match. Where is he? I'll punch your face in. I'm the one searching for him. - Let me know if you see him. - Okay, buddy. I'll let you know if I see him. Hey, stop the vehicle. Where are you coming from? Answer me. Are you drunk? Come here! Why are you out so late? - Coming from work, sir. - Go see the inspector. - Please, sir. - Go on. Stop! Where are you coming from? - From work. - Show me your license. - Kalai Arasan, sir! - Kalai Arasan? - Where are you going? - The two-storeyed building. - Hey... - Sir? Do you know Raaki? I do, sir. He is my friend. Call him now. Sir, I don't have a phone. Are you selling pot? No, sir! I work at a petrol bunk. He looks suspicious. Check him. Sir... Check him! No, sir. I really work at a petrol bunk. - I am not lying. - Why are you out so late? Take your hands off. Sir, please believe me! - Sir... - Let go of my hand. You're a peddler, right? Sir, he's got money. Where is this cash from? It's my first salary, sir! Which fuel bunk? Saamy Service Station in Adayar. Got the phone number? - Sir, please don't. - Tell me. I got the job by lying I am from Saidapet. If they find out I am from Kaveri Nagar, I'll lose my job! I asked you for the phone number. Sir, please don't. - Get him into the police jeep. - Sir, please. Come on. - Move it. - Please, sir! Sir, give me a minute. Look at him speeding away. Catch him. Here's the number, sir! Call this number. Yes, sir? Does a guy named Kalai work at your bunk? - Kalai? - The one from Kaveri Nagar. Sir, he said he was from Saidapet. No sir, he's from Kaveri Nagar. If you're hiring someone, won't you do a background check? You should at least get an ID proof. How can you be so careless? Actually, a well-known customer recommended him. What if he slits your throat and robs the bunk? You're running a business. Be careful, sir. Okay, sir. Be a good employee. If I get any complaint against you, I'll skin you alive. Get him address and send him away. Come with me. Dude, let it go. It's not like its some fancy job. We'll find another one. Dude... Drink up your tea. We'll deal with Perumal soon. Have you seen Raaki? He's been gone for 5-6 days now. Did Kerala Police catch him buying "stuff" from Idukki? Hey, that's Raaki! Dude! - Hey, Raaki! - Hop on, dude. Raaki! Raaki, where did you disappear? - Where's your phone? - I'll tell you later. - Where were you? - Move, I'll tell you later. - Your sister got worried. - I'll tell you everything, dude! Your phone was switched off. We looked for you everywhere. Dude, it's a long story. I'll tell you later. Raaki, watch out. Dude, we are trapped. Karna, take Kalai and run away. Tiger, get him. Raaki, run away. Run! Get him. They are right behind us. - Get them! - Don't let them get away. Kalai, jump over! They're here. Kalai, careful! Get up, Kalai! Run! - Run, Kalai! - Surround them. Surround them. Kalai, get away somehow. - Kalai, run away. - No, dude... Kaliyan, finish him! Run! Just get out of here! I'm turning left, you go the other way! Okay, I'll escape somehow. You get away too! Run! You're dead, man I am coming for you! You go that way. You, this way. Manickam, are you okay? I am fine. Finish him off! Kalai, come with me! Raaki, go away! Dude, let's run away. Come on. Hurry up. Kaliyan! Karna... Raaki! Raaki! Why? Dude... Raaki... Raaki... Buddy, are you okay? Buddy... Dude! Marb... marb... marbles. Raaki? Raaki! Raaki! My friend, you are gone. Buddy... 'In the blood-stained land Now...' Sir, the forensic team is on their way. Fingerprints, sir. Shut up! Get here soon. I'm going. Hey, where are you going? Dude, I'll go to the police station. I've committed a murder. They will eventually get me. - What is wrong with you? Are you crazy? - No, I'll surrender. Let me go, dude! Don't talk crap. Move. How many times do I tell you? Stop annoying me. Take this. Dude, drink up! Gulp it down. Go ahead. They killed Raaki. Don't cry! Please don't cry, dude. It's all over. Stop crying! Listen to me. Don't stop the car. Keep driving. Come on, guys. We shouldn't spare him. Kill him right here. Break the door! Break it open! You killed our Kaliyan. - Stop this and leave now. - I won't rest until I kill you. Get them out. I'll take care of them. - Sir, they got my buddy. Let me do this! - Listen to me. Leave now! I'm not letting this go. Their death is in my hands. Let them out! Manick, don't create a ruckus. Get out! Chase them away. - Your death lies in my hands. - Everybody out! Chase them away. Go... go. Send everyone out. What are you staring at? Send them out. - Ma... - Move on. Go and sit down. File an FIR. Velan, we're producing them in court tomorrow. Get the weapons. - Get the fingerprint analyst. - Okay, sir. Dude! Dude, what's wrong? The inspector has asked you to leave. You must come when we send word. What have you written? Don't be so considerate. Make it strong. Velan, come here! Don't be scared. We'll be fine. - Sir! - Sir! The full area is under our control. Accused has been arrested. - Have you filed the FIR? - Yes, sir! - Sir. - No problem. The fingerprint analyst is working on it. If the finger print matches, we'll go ahead. - The post-mortem report... - It will be ready by morning. Sir, they are the accused. Coffee or tea, sir? Coffee. Get him a coffee. Sir, I don't think you need an introduction to Kaveri Nagar. It's a very tough area, sir. Really challenging to work there. This is really a punishment for me. Sir, the fingerprint on the weapon doesn't match with his. Not a match? - Sir, I'm the one who did it. The machine must be faulty. Let's check your fingerprints. Sir, why are you checking his fingerprints? - Sir, it wasn't him. I did this, sir! - Why are you acting up now? Sir, it was me! Perumal, what's happening? Sorry for the inconvenience, sir! Sir, I did it. Sir, trust me. It was not him. - Shut your mouth. He didn't do anything, sir! Sir, he is a decent guy with a job at the petrol bunk. He didn't do it! Sir, please don't... Sir, his fingerprint is a match. - Sir, listen to me. It's not him. - I said, shut up! Sir, I did it. Sir, we'll charge him as A1 and him as A2? There are already complaints on you for false accusations. This is unnecessary trouble. Let him go. Okay, sir. Velan! Sir, Kalai is an innocent guy. Let him go. There's no one else to take care of his parents. Poor Kalai. Please tell him, sir. Don't create trouble here. Get going. - Go away. - Kalai is innocent, sir. - Go now. - Sir... Why are you still here? They let me go, right? Go home. Wait, ma'am. The inspector said she could leave. You go ahead, ma'am. Kalai... When the judge questions you at the court, say you didn't kill him. Say you were beaten up and forced to accept. I'll take care of everything. Kalai, listen to me. Don't be scared. What are you doing here? He told you to go. Get going. Kalai, don't be scared. I'm here for you. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. A young man from our community, a treasured friend, has been lost. Give us the strength to overcome this grief. In His name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Dude! Is the funeral done? He didn't look dead. You know how he gets drunk and passes out on my lap? That's how he looked in the ice box. His sister kept weeping, asking why we abandoned him. I didn't know what to say. During the burial, they asked us to throw handful of sand on him. I started shivering. I didn't do it. I ran away. I'll find a good lawyer and get you out on bail. Don't worry. You mongrel, you're the reason he stole as a kid... ...now you've made him a murderer! - No, I didn't... - What else do you want from him? Ma, he didn't do anything. You piece of garbage. You'll die a ghastly death. - Filthy dog, you won't be at peace! - Ma, don't hit him. Ma, stop beating him up. You've wrecked our family. Ma'am, what's all this ruckus? You should leave, boy. Ma, he didn't do anything! Let go, ma'am. Son, come out. Hey, Karna... Ma... - Ma, what did he do? - He's the reason for everything. Why would you hit him for something I did? - Ma'am, come with me. - Leave now. Let me say a few words to him. - Get going, ma'am. - Kalai... - Ma! Keep moving! - Let me speak to him for a couple of minutes. Ma'am, please. I beg you... Don't create a ruckus. Get going. You heard us. Just leave. - You are so annoying. Get going. - Ma'am, please! Looks like my son's fate is to spend his life in jail. Ma... Ma? Ma! Karna... - What are you doing? - Let go of me. What is the matter with you? - Why do you want to slit your wrist? - Let go of me. - Are you crazy? - Leave me alone! I'm so furious! - Drop it down. - Let go. Drop it, now. I asked you to throw it down. Don't you dare... Are you crazy or what? Go ahead. Slap me. What's wrong? I met Kalai's mother in jail. She accused me of being the reason behind all this mess... ...hit me and humiliated me. I don't wish to live anymore. It's nothing. Don't cry. I'm losing everyone one by one. Raaki left me. My mother doesn't talk to me. I don't have anybody else. I am here for you, right? Will you be there for me? I promise, I'll be there. You won't leave me? I won't! "Oh, girl..." "Oh, girl..." "You're my only love." "You're my only love." "Oh, girl..." "Oh, girl..." "You're my only love." "You're my only love." "I fade into thin air I become the breath we share" "I melt away into the sea I become a fish with you." "In the canvas of your body I become a nail that creates art." "In my passion for you, girl I become a face where kisses live." "Like a pair of shade-loving flowers We become one with the showers." "I fade into thin air I become the breath we share" "I melt away into the sea I become a fish with you." "A flower's impression on the leave Eyelids fluttering like peacock's plume." "For a thousand years I shall treasure This violence of blissful pleasure." "Being an infant in your arms This intoxication never wanes." "What are we now? Just two children." "To make my sweetheart blossom We became seeds of love." "In Cupid's diary We became a love story." "I fade into thin air I become the breath we share" "I melt away into the sea I become a fish with you." Do you know why I like you? Why? Because you said, if you had the money you'd give it all to Kaveri Nagar! Would you be okay with it even after we get married? Of course! Die! Karna... Damn it, he dodged it! Throw the next TV. This way! Malar, are you okay? Malar, what happened? I am okay. Let's get out of here. You scoundrels. Come down. Just wait till we get there. Revenge, is it? Come and get me if you can! Karna... Come at me. Karna... Let him go. You oaf! Let's leave, come! - Die! - You scumbag. You people killed my Kaliyan... I'll kill you and then kill that jerk who's in jail. Don't do it, boy. Karna! You'll get yourself arrested, don't do this. You hothead, stop this nonsense! Come on! Stab me. You aren't satisfied with two deaths? Why do you keep going back to this? I didn't start this! Look at what they did! You old hag. Take your son home. - Or I'll stab him right here. - I dare you to do it. - I beg you, think of me as your mother. - Ma, what's wrong with you? - Just give up all of this. - Come and stab me. Shut up, don't prolong this. - I didn't do anything. It's him! I won't say this again. Take your son home now, or you'll be carrying his corpse home. You're the big guy here. Let me apologize on his behalf. Don't beg that guy, Ma. I'm sparing your life now, thanks to your mother. - Or what? - I'll blow your death horn! Let's go, boy. - I'll blow your death horn! I'm sure I'll get you someday. Come at me! I won't spare you. 'The customer you are calling is not available' No problem. We can file a 437 CRPC. Then book a bail in lower court. - Okay, madam. - If we don't get it, then sessions court. It's my responsibility to escalate it to high court and get the bail. Wherever we go, we'll have to deal with police, PP and the likes. It'll cost minimum 2 Lakhs. Give me a lakh as advance. - 1 lakh? - Brother... I'll get one lakh to you in a week. Please start work on it. I'll start work only after you bring me the money. Brother! Pushpa sister has been taken to the police station. - Really? - Yes. - Murugan, bring me that file. - Sir, where is Pushpa? She's there. That way. - You sit right there. - Hey Karna! We did nothing, but they brought us in. What happened, sister? What is he looking for in my house? Wait, he's checking. Raaki is no more. What more could you want? You can't let us live with dignity? Sir, what is it you want? You've ruined our home. You're treating a lady like a suspect. She's innocent, sir! Get it! Her brother is dead, now his sister starts peddling? Sir, don't say such things. She never even ate a meal from Raaki's money. She runs a petty shop with dignity. Where did this come from? Raaki must have hid it. Raaki hid it? Where else did he hide stuff? I don't understand. I received a call from control room about 5kg dope in Kaveri Nagar. There's half a kilo in this. Where is the rest? Perumal! Keep making these false allegations... I'm going to shoot you one day. You're questioning us here, but will you ever do this to Manick? - Be quiet. - Who are you? How dare you hurt The Gun? Look, he's hitting me. Hey, I'll shoot you too! You dare not raise your hand on me! Look, he's hitting me! Sir. She's innocent! She's never been to the police station before. Please let her go, sir. Take her back home. Thank you, sir. Sir, the boys? Who am I to pin the case on? You can pin it on me. Perumal is lying, Karna. When he walked out of the house... he had nothing with him. Let it go, sister. He's let us go. Guys, take The Gun to the hospital. I'll drop her home. - Okay. - Take care! Come. If Raaki were here, he wouldn't have let this happen. Whose picture is this? 'E. Murugan' If I wanted to marry, I'd have said yes to Laundry Murugan. Laundry Murugan... Okay, I'll call you back. Sir, just yesterday, we met the country doctor and got herbs to cure piles. He said you should strictly avoid oil. What is this? What do I do? I don't want to eat this either. My stupid tongue won't listen. Sir, hello! - Come Karna, want some fritters? - No thank you! You'd asked for me, sir? What's that chick saying now? Who, sir? The lady lawyer! She said she'll get him out for a lakh. She'll wipe you clean. Idiot! Karna, careful. Don't trip. I planned for a lift here, but no budget. So we have to take the stairs. Sir, about the lawyer... Even if you throw 10 Lakhs at her, she can't get Kalai out. She's a scammer. A fraud. Saw what happened to Three-Storey Gang Bhaskar? She milked him for 6 Lakhs. She lost the case anyway. He's in Puzhal prison now. She's not your deity, but your devil. But sir, she seemed like a good person. In these wretched times, evil people appear good. And good people appear evil. Why don't you suggest a good lawyer, sir? A lawyer can't do anything about this. I can, though. How, sir? I'll drop a weapon in the crime scene. I'll produce it as new evidence. I'll plant evidence of Kaliyan's blood. I'll ask two men to surrender at the Chengalpet court, admitting to the murder. I'll change the old forensic report. The judge will be thrown off. He'll take it out on me. He'll dismiss the new evidence, Kalai will be released. This will cost 10 Lakhs. I'll start work immediately if you give me 2 Lakhs. I need to submit the charge-sheet in 90 days. It's been 30 days. There's 60 days to go. Your time starts now. Did you take the money from my pants? Ma? I'm talking to you. Are you deaf? I thought you were doing petty theft. What's with this bundle of cash? Whose life are you ruining, you scum? Where did you get this from? It doesn't concern you. This money... it's going to kill you. Ma, stop with your rants. My ears hurt. You do all this because you have a mother. I don't want to live to see your obituary ceremony poster. Your two mates' lives have already ended. I'm leaving. I'm leaving this house. I can't live with you any more. I'll go away somewhere. I've beaten up this mongrel, I've burnt him... he doesn't change one bit, stubborn jerk! I'm done. See you. I'm never going back there. I'm not going back until this ends. Here he comes. Karna, how did you get all this money in 2 days? I applied for a bank loan. What? You're joking? Of course! You're asking a thief how he got the money? I just need to get Kalai out. I'm off, sir! Oh, hey... Didn't somebody storm out of the house? One must always stand by their words. Always so melodramatic. You're making fun of me? Not just the house, I'm going to leave this world. You'll understand my worth only when I die. Wait, wait... You'll be like this for as long as I am alive. You'll know my worth when I'm gone. Stop with the TV serial dialogues! You think this is a TV Serial? I'll hang in front of your eyes. Ma, why do you keep making 'rasam'? How about some chicken curry or fish curry? Your mother is hanging herself, you're asking for chicken and fish curry? I'm going to die. Bring home some woman who will cook for you. Ma, before you hang, just make me one omlette? That's right, a little tighter around the neck. Damn, what a miss. Oh, no! Ma... You're laughing? You just stood by and watched while I was hanging? I know your worn out saree will just tear, don't I? You're my shadow. You're stuck with me. You'll go nowhere. Please give up all this nonsense. It scares your mother! Ma, just one more month. It's for Kalai's bail. Once Kalai is out of jail, I'll do whatever the hell you want me to do. I promise on you, Papamma! You're my darling! How are you, Rani? My brother got out of jail. But now, you're in here. Just my luck. Hey, my buddy's getting out of here real soon! I've made all the arrangements. You'll be out soon! - Dude. - What? From here, it looks like you're the one behind bars. Be careful! So Mitta Sai Baba. You think they can touch me? I'll take care. I'll see you? Police officer Perumal called me. - Tell him Karna is here. He knows. - Okay, sir. Can I go? Thanks, bro! Is Perumal here? What? "Let's douse the fire with wine." "This is the pinnacle of pleasure." "Let's hit the heights, come on." "Let's fill the night with some ecstasy." "Let's float in our magical world." "Soak it all up just this once." "Let's get the third eye to open." Sir! Sir! Hey Karna. Come, come! This is amazing. That's why I invited you to my house party. What will you drink? - No thanks, sir. - You must. One cognac, please. Enjoy yourself! - How's it? - It feels like heaven, sir. Why did you call me, sir? You see the fat man? In the black coat? Yes, do you know who he is? Who is it? Session court judge. Mr. Vishwanathan. Aren't judges supposed to be good? - Judges are human too. I've told him in detail about Kalai. I've paid him too. Thank you, sir! Every word uttered by a judge is like a holy utterance. His words will set Kalai free. Come, I'll introduce you to him. Sir... - Hi, Perumal! - Hi, sir! How are you? Anything special today? Yes, sir! This is the boy I told you about. - Hello, sir! - What's your name? Karna, sir! Please get Kalai out sir. Perumal mentioned. I'll take care. I think of you as our deity, sir. - Don't worry! I'll handle it. - Thanks, sir. Enjoy, sir! - Are you happy? - Thanks sir. I'll get going then. Hey, where are you going? Sir, my Mom's asked me to come home early. The judge will be here till 2 AM. Stay within his sight till then. It will help Kalai come out sooner. The more he gets drunk, he becomes a child. Talk to him then. We'll get the work done! So? Are you staying or leaving? - I'll stay. - Good! Karna, Indian women and imported alcohol. Mix up. - Hello doctor, how are you? - Hi. - Hi, how is your mother? - Fine, thank you, doctor! Great. Why are these trays still here? Papamma hasn't come today. How can you be so casual? It's already 7 am. If people don't get their milk, they will skin me alive. Yes, brother? Papamma hasn't showed up this morning, Can you check on her? Okay, brother. I'll call you back. Ma'am... Ma'am! Ma'am... - Where is Karna? - I tried calling him. - Do any of you know? - No idea, uncle. He said he'll come back from ECR and join for dinner. Do you know where he went? Maybe Jill-Jill bar, he goes there often. - You know where that is? - Yes I do. Where? Which area? A little further ahead. Stop, Karna's bike is lying on the ground there. Stop, stop, stop! Brother, wake up. Brother? - Karna... wake up. - Brother, get up. He's passed out drunk. Carry him! Mani, grab his legs. Careful. We can't give him an injection in this state. We have to wait till tomorrow morning. Ma? Ma... Sister, have you seen my mother? Have you seen my mother? Not sure what I had. I took one hit... I was knocked out. I have no idea what happened after that. Did my mother get angry and leave? Hey, I'm asking you! Tell me... Your mother passed away. You fool! Don't say shit. Why are you beating him up? You're the one who passed out drunk. What are you saying? Your mom's heart gave away worrying about you. Don't you dare say such things. Let go of me. Uncle, what's she saying? It's true. Your mother passed away. I performed her last rites. Look there. Why is he like this? What can we do? Let it go. "You were on a journey in this Earth." "When it ends, death is the only way out." "Time passes, it shifts But it is not yours." "Nobody is here to stay Nothing is real here." "Did I ask to be born?" "This life was a gift from you, Mother." "Did you consider me a burden?" "Your poor son is all alone now." "I lived just for you..." "But that time has passed now." "You were my everything, my son." "Just to bring you into this world..." "I took this life, my son." Ma, why did you leave me alone? I haven't gone anywhere. I'm still here with you. Don't loiter around at night, okay? Be good, okay? Take care of your health. "The Sun has shattered..." "The Sun has shattered It's the end of my daytime." "The skies have withered It's the end of my nighttime." "Without you, I have become a lie." "Without my shadow, I have become lonely" "I have lost I have lost." "I have lost you." "A million deities may come together." "All the love in the world may be showered on me." "But there's no one to protect me the way you did" Karna... Eat something! Malar, how long has it been since my mother died? About a month now. What did you have that night? You were unconscious for 3 days. What happened that day? Perumal asked me to come to a bungalow in ECR. Perumal introduced me to a judge. He asked me to stay till 2 am. He made me drink... He gave me something else... Karna... Something else happened too. What happened? Inspector Perumal just questioned me. Perumal is lying about something. It must be something Raaki hid. Something Raaki hid? Where else did he hide stuff? Perumal thrashed us, asking if Raaki gave us any stuff. Stuff? Karna! Karna, remember you gave me 2 lakh rupees... how did you get that money? - Sir... - Yes? - We need to get Kalai out of jail. - We will... Where did you get the money from? The owner of the petrol bunk Kalai worked at... I stole it from him. Don't lie. The stuff that Raaki stole is with you. Where have you stashed it? Where is it? - I've got the stuff... - Where? I've stashed it down there... - Where? - I've kept it... Don't piss me off. Did Raaki tell you why I sent him to Pondicherry? Pondicherry? Why Pondicherry? The 5 kilos of heroin that was seized by the Customs in Pondicherry... ...my friend had possession of it. I sent Raaki to Pondicherry to get it. That scumbag tried to escape with the stuff. I found him after 5 days... I chased him. Hey, that's Raaki. - Dude! - Raaki! Where were you? That idiot ran away from me and escaped, only to die in the hands of Kaliyan! I took Raaki's phone from him. I checked his call logs. He spoke to a local drug dealer from Parrys. I thrashed that guy and interrogated him. But he knew nothing. I have no idea where the stuff is. Did he give it to you? Is it with you? Tell me. Doctor... Karna? Karna, get up. Don't fall asleep. It's worth 50 million. Please make him talk. We can't do anything more. Give him another dose. Let's see if he wakes up. - He may die if we give more. - Then let him die. You could have questioned him at the police station. Why bring him here? I am doing something illegal. How could I question him legally? Once he finds out it's worth 50 million, what if he tries to make a run too? Don't give me unsolicited advice. I'm already here on a punishment posting. Everyone in the department is watching me. Just do it! Karna, did Raaki tell you anything? Did he say where he hid it? You were with him, when he died. Tell me! - He said... - Yes, tell me... What did he say? Marb... marb... marbles. Marb? Marb... marb... marbles. Perumal, what is this? Marb... marb... marbles. When Raaki died... he said "marbles". Now I know why. Not just that... I also know where he kid the stuff. - Go away! - Sir... Poor guy, he didn't even get to see his mother's body. So he's gone crazy. Spare the poor guy. 'A FEW EVENTS LATER...' Dude! Hey, buddy... Dude, how are you doing? Been ages since I saw you. - Kalai! - How are you, Kalai? - Shorty, how are you? - I'm good, brother. You don't have to worry about anyone now. - Thanks a lot, dude. - Don't thank me. Bro, stand up. I'm so happy now, Malar. I got Kalai out somehow. - You are a big-shot now. - Karna... Come in! - Why me? - Just come. Go. - Dude, I don't think... - Just come! - Ma! - Don't do this! Ma, Karna did nothing wrong. He's the reason I got out of jail. - I'm sorry. - Bless you, son. What, dad? Your son is back now. How about a party? Shall I get you some liquor? - Shorty, get us a quarter. - Right away, brother. Karna managed to get you out somehow. I am so happy. I wish Raaki... - Sister, Kalai got you a gift. Want to see? - A gift? For me? - Yes. What is it? - Come with me. - What is it? Tell me! Come and see it for yourself! There is your gift. We looked everywhere in the city for Laundry Murugan. We finally found him near Vadapalani Murugan Temple, doing laundry. I've forgotten him. Why did you bring him here? He hasn't forgotten you. He's named his daughter Pushpa. In your memory. His wife is no more. He's struggling with a daughter all alone. What are you going to say now? That you've forgotten him? Then what does this mean? She hid your picture between her sarees! Here, keep it with you. What? Let's talk? - Let's do it, dude! - We'll seal the deal. Great! You managed to convince sister to settle down. It was a piece of cake to me. - Great job, dude. - Of course. Look, its your girlfriend! Go talk to her. Go on. I knew... - I knew you'd be back. - Don't cry. Hi! Hey! Why did you hit me now? I was playing with you! I'll call the police. Go ahead. Raaki... I heard about everything that happened. I was dumbstruck. What had really happened? How did you close the case? How did you get me released. It's all mysterious! Marb... marb... marbles! Stop singing. Tell me what happened! I didn't get you out. Raaki did! Don't confuse me. Just tell me. Where did Raaki hide his marbles when we were children? Under the Saidapet bridge! Why did Raaki go missing for 3 days? Why did he say "Marbles" before he died? Why did Perumal corner me? I mulled over all of these questions! I figured Perumal assigned Raaki with some major task before he died. So I took a wild guess and checked below the bridge... And I found it. - What did you find? - Heroin! Imported powder! - Really? - Expensive stuff! I wondered what to do with it... I started playing Perumal's game. - I'll go to the court and be back, sir. - Go ahead. Sir, you said you had to go to the commissioner's office by 10? - I'll take care. You leave. - Hello, hello! - Hello? - Hello, sir. I have a good news for you! If I catch you, I'll break your head and dump you in an asylum. Sir, just hear me out... The stuff you were looking for, Raaki's stuff... it's with me now. Hold on... Hello? - Where are you now? - At the Bus Factory near the airport. Are you coming here? Or should I come there? I'll come. Stay there. Come over, sir. I'll wait here. Marbles! Sir! - Where is it? - I've hidden it in the terrace. Why? What if someone stole it from me? From you? Go! Where did he go? Hey... You are late! Come. Where's the stuff? It's safe, sir. Come on. - Come, sir. - Where is it? This way... Here you go. Sir? Is it heroin? Having a good trip? How much would this sell for? 50 million. You and Raaki made me run behind you for this stuff, right? You fraudsters! You're dead today. Sir, I just found it. You couldn't sell it, so you are saying you just found it, huh? I've seen many criminals like you. You filth! You got the stuff now, right? Get Kalai out! - No way in hell! - Sir, Kalai? He's going to rot in jail. You mongrel. - You betrayed me. - Stop it, Karna. You're the reason I couldn't even see my mother one last time. You piece of filth. Karna, don't... stop it. Stop it! Who are these guys? Hit men? Narcotics. Oh great! One minute... Thank goodness you're here at the right time. Heroin worth 50 million. I caught him red-handed. Arrest him! Wow! Perumal sir. So Mita Sai Baba! Sir, I can't believe he's laughing. Arrest him. Mr. Perumal, stop all this drama! He came to us and told us everything. He's lying, sir. He is the criminal. Boys, take off the cameras from here. Sir, may we talk alone? Perumal, the cameras are still recording. First, get those cameras off. Cameras aren't new to me. 1... 2... 3... 10 of you. Take 5 million per person. I don't want a penny. Mr. Muruga Perumal, we're a bunch of clean hands in the department. - Yes, boys? - Yes, sir. Come on. Marb... marb... marbles. Throw him in the van. Marb... marb... marbles. Marb... marb... marbles. Vetrivel! Mukund, Rajesh. Get in. Start the vehicle. Where is the driver? He's gone to have tea. He'll be back soon. - Ask him to come immediately. - Okay, sir. Vetri, did you check the recording? - Yes, sir. - Manick? Karna got me caught by Narcotics. Chop him into pieces. I'll pay you as much as you want. Finish him. Come on! Tell me you want revenge for Kaliyan. I'll give up! But if it's for Perumal... I'll slit you! Perumal is trying to buy you over with money. I don't think that way... - You're dead. - We are people who value people... Manick! Why are we killing each other for filth like Perumal? Who are they to decide how we should live? Manick, if you kill me now, you'll end up in jail. Your wife and children will end up in the streets. If you still want to kill me... go ahead. Manick, kill me. Go ahead. What happened after that? Manick became friends with me! Woah! That's awesome, dude. How did you break the case and get me out? One pinch of that powder goes for a lot of money. I took a pinch from those 5 kilos. That's how you got out! Give them money, they'll salute to anybody. At least starting now, we should lead a bright life. Let's do it. You leave! He's the reason for all our problems! We put an end to him, we put an end to all our problems. Don't get caught in this mess! Listen to me, leave! - Karna... - Kalai, leave. Karna... You can leave, I have no issues with you. Let him go. Kalai... Run away. How can I? Think of your parents for a minute. You don't deserve this. Run. Run away! How can I? Go! Get going. Go!
