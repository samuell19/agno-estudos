SAPHA: This is my anxiety survival broadcast... ensuring a past-future programming. My brain is recreating a negative repeat pattern. Hello, Radio Olympia. This is direct television from the studios at Alexandra Palace. (Shouts in German) Our army is maintained solely for the preservation of peace or for the restoration of peace after it has been lost by others. (Lively classical music) (Gunfire) WOMAN: ♪ I'm for you a hundred per cent... MAN. New evidence of communist activities in government circles is promised by the House Committee on Un-American... If I should ever find a rotten apple in any barrel given to my care, it won't take me three and a half years to get rid of it. And who knows but that millions more of innocent people may pay the price of your treason. (High-pitched whining) WOMAN: Professor JD Zanov's lecture on negative energy, incest and the probability of an event will commence in three minutes. (Beep) (Speaks Russian) There is no doubt as to where a real communist's loyalty rests. Their allegiance is to Russia, not the United States. (Blast of car horn) (Engines droning) (Gunfire) ...end of the Communist regime, Stalin's place as leader was taken by Georgy Malenkov. (Static hiss) Sir Winston Churchill returned from the South of France on the same day that Mr Eden came back from the Mediterranean. You have been touring the Mau Mau areas. How did you find things when you left? Yes, that's right. I went on a short tour of about four days. As you probably know, there's not trouble all over Kenya. There's a large part of Kenya where there's no trouble at all. (Whimsical tune) When I got back to England, I saw a fella walking down the street, a Jewish friend, with a roll of cloth under his arm. I said, 'Where are you going?' (Explosions) MAN: Now you too can enjoy all the security and protection... EISENHOWER: We have learned that the free world cannot indefinitely remain in a posture of paralysed tension. (Laughter) ZANOV: We have files on most people we think we know... ...and talking tapes to fit categories of types we Call characters. We love to say, 'I like him', or 'I didn't like her', as though it has some kind of relevance. Some of us have very sophisticated files... ...In which we think we recognise behaviour that fits theories on the human personality. Next time you are handed a file on character... ...put it aside. Imagine you have one minute together before the apocalypse. Facing annihilation... does help to suspend judgment. (Man shouting merged with operatic singing) (Gunshots) (Gunshots) SAPHA: Dream three. Zanov is speaking to me through a radio. But it doesn't wake me. ZANOV: The human personality is not the result of our life and times, cause and effect. But a massive evolutionary coding... SAPHA: At this point everything went dead on the radio. MAN: Happy birthday, Mother. The present is terrifying because It is irrevocable. Hello. Good morning, Sir. (Faint operatic music in background) (Clink of crockery) WOMAN: Name? Name? Would you please sign the bill, sir? ZANOV: Try to think. Try to think. Do you notice anything unusual? SAPHA: Nothing. Except I'm very, very tired. ZANOV: Try to think. Why are you in this room? SAPHA: I kept hearing this noise in my ears, like some kind of interference on a radio. Billions of tiny threads seemed to be drawing me to one event. ...tiny threads... Billions of tiny threads... ...tiny threads... ...one event. ...one event. ...one event. ...one event. ..one event. ...one event. ..one event. ...one event. ..one event.

(Echoing speech fades out) (Phone continues ringing) (Faint opera music and muffled speech) (Phone stops ringing) THERAPIST: ..visualise this first item from the hierarchy? For this exercise I'd like you to focus about six feet ahead of you... ...on the floor. And I'd like you to see every detail, every colour, shape... ...every texture. ZANOV: The key object... The key object... THERAPIST: And at the same time I'd like you to focus inside to that place where the bottom of your breathing is. And breathe. Don't try to see. Just let yourself see. Remember, we are only trying to be aware. We are not trying to change anything. The way of reaching it is not trying. Somewhere inside your mind there's a switch. SAPHA: It is impossible for me to understand space if I have no idea of time. It is impossible for me to understand time if I have no idea of eternity. THERAPIST: The meter is saying to you... ...that it's very easy to go away, to go into a quiet place. And that's a beautiful quiet place. Now, there is a danger that you could be using that to run away, to not see what's in the world. WOMAN: Now you see with the eyes closed, with the attention turned inward, he was producing alpha. And that's the large... the large brainwave here. THERAPIST: We want to use the meters now in just the opposite direction. That is to bring you in touch more with the world that we're in. It's very easy for us to lose conscious... ...Of.. today. Of here and now, of this minute. The object of bio-feedback is complete emotional freedom. SAPHA.

Victor One-One, did you receive my Two-Two-Three-Zero? SAPHA: First of all I must affirm I cannot feel the plane on which I live. It's 1:38 and the truth is, that I travel on a journey that was accomplished before I set out. This street is already a foregone conclusion. But I'm always too late to understand it. At each moment of turning the corner... ...1 catch a glimpse of the eternal process. But I am forever a half a second too late. MALE VOICE: Sex? Female. Height: five feet four. Weight: 112 pounds.

(Echoing) .."cos I have never left her. The primary imprint remains. The primary imprint... THERAPIST: Who's with you? Make sure you keep breathing. WOMAN: I live with my mother. She's a depressive. She failed to function in a world that admired nothing else. The recommended treatment was shock. You see, it was fashionable in 1954 to recommend insulin for disobedient women. Non-conformist ladies were either 'dykes' or 'frigid bitches'. Now... orgasm has become a social necessity. You see, my mother wasn't very successful at placating men. It's a genetic flaw. It runs in the family. It's a genetic flaw. It runs in the family. ...in the family. (High-pitched beep) WOMAN: Yes, I was married. He was a scientist. A rational thinker. Men hate need. He wanted submission... ...without need. And I was the lunatic that wouldn't be lobotomised. SAPHA: The primary imprint remains. The primary imprint remains. The primary imprint... WOMAN: It's a genetic flaw. It's a genetic flaw. It runs in the family. WOMAN: Name? MAN: Sapha. Joseph Dimitri. - Date of birth? - 29th of May, 1953. - Occupation? - Gambler. - Project number? - Seven. WOMAN: Subjects: Negative energy, incest, and the probability of an event. Unit Director, JD Zanov. At the centre of our universe is a puzzle picture. And the laws that govern this cosmology... ...are self, plus event fantasies. You see, our whole life has been structured by naming and defining... on preferences and disinclinations - on things that gratify and things that repel. But the origin of these assessments is a puzzle picture. (Echoing) ..puzzle-picture... ...puzzle... puzzle... SAPHA: 1:44. I'm going forward like a blind man... ...who feels the paving stones and the walls of the houses with his stick... ...and believes in the existence of that which he touches. That which has gone has disappeared... and will never return. But I can see nothing... because I am a blind man. (Indistinct two-way radio speech) SAPHA: I sense the route which I have travelled... ...and expect that the way ahead will continue. I grope my way for I cannot see. To say that I can see would only be possible should I know the past and the future. In order for this to happen it would be necessary for me to liberate myself from matter. (Indistinct two-way radio speech) SAPHA: It's 1:40. The square is bleak and cold... ...and ahead of me I can see the hotel. In three minutes, I am due for my third interview with Zanov. ZANOV: Can you remember yesterday? Last Wednesday? The summer before last? Do you believe in luck? Do you think you have choices? (Speaks Japanese) (Replies) (Woman speaks Russian) (Replies) So... if the precognition subject... By this I mean he or she who perceives time ahead of time, what we normally call the future. If the precognition subject has a different perspective on reality, or put it this way, he or she sees the happening from a wider view. This is my reality here. These two glasses. The precognition subject sees these two glasses and also this glass. He has a wider perspective on reality. He sees these two glasses and also this glass, as though witnessing life from the top of a high building. Witnessing events at the far end of the street. Whereas you or I with our average vision, see only our limited surroundings - these two glasses. The precognition subject sees these two glasses and also this glass. Now... whether he or she can prevent the happening - the car accident he witnesses, or, if you like, predicts - is quite another matter. It would entail reshaping massive energy structures which are inter-connected with everything and everyone. In fact, incredibly, each most minute action is interlinked with every atom in the universe. SAPHA: I toy with the idea of choices. But I know I operate on automatic control. If I ever believed I had a will, this illusion has been taken from me. And so my thoughts create my forms... ...and my past actions a perpetual labyrinth, a web. ...a perpetual labyrinth, a web. (Siren wails) (Muffled overlapping voices) WOMAN: Professor JD Zanov's lecture on negative energy, and the probability of an event will commence in five minutes. (Overlapping voices continue) SAPHA: You see, my brain can only keep in focus, like my eye, one small segment of reality. (Indistinct low conversation) (Engine idling) (Engine revs) SAPHA: At a sub-atomic level there is no time or space. PHYSICIST: It began with a paradox. But this is the paradox. Here is a light wave coming towards you. It passes you at a certain speed. Now, if you move towards the light wave, then it passes you at exactly the same speed. This is the paradox. Suppose we agree that we can never tell if we are in motion or at rest. Then we have to give up a certain idea about time. The fact is, you and I, neither of us, can decide which is really moving or not. And therefore when I say two things happen simultaneously, you say they do not, we are both right. Nothing can move faster than light. Things get heavier as they move past you. If a clock moves past you it goes slower. Time is not what we thought it was. E = MC-squared. SAPHA: And somewhere beyond my shadow lies anti-clock. The potentiality of an event. Or, rather, the source of the potentiality of an event... forks out and stretches back beyond my mole vision. And therefore, responsibility, or the notion of it, becomes absurd. (Thunderous explosive boom) SAPHA: I'm merely a mental snapshot of myself. (Shipping forecast on radio) (Overlapping voices on electronic media) MAN: The probability of an event is the square of something. When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude - this 'A' number - is the sum of the 'A's for each of the various alternatives. We are not averse to using the theory of probability, that is calculating odds, when a Situation's very complicated. If you throw up a die and it spins so many times, and the air with the various resistance and atoms and all this complicated business that we're perfectly willing to allow, that we don't know enough details... And so we calculate the odds. So it's 50-50 probability because, like a die, it's set sort of at random. It seems to be in some sense intrinsic. Someone has said it this way. 'Nature herself doesn't know which way the electron is going to go.' The future, in other words, is unpredictable. But here what we're proposing, is it not, is that there be probability all the way back at the fundamental laws. That in the fundamental laws of physics there are...

It's 2.4 seconds long around this drum. I'll put the paper - spectrogram paper - on the marking drum. And prepare to analyse... And 80 seconds later, all of the information found on this segment of the tape will be recorded on this piece of paper, time versus frequency. ANOTHER MAN: But the real bit came when the electroencephalogram... ...was being used as a Clinical tool. And they saw small 50-microvolt changes in the brain. Could read it out, moment to moment. Second by second. SCIENTIST: We know there are these peculiar faculties of the psyche, that it isn't entirely confined to space and time. You can have dreams or visions of the future. You can see around corners. MAN: What do you think of Prohibition, Professor?

Time you should be dreaming ♪ Little man, you've had a busy day... SAPHA: And so the mirror game had begun again. Switching itself on and off. And now the process of waking is hardly different from sleeping. And everything that happened seemed quite uninvited by my will. ZANOV: Well, Sapha, either the future is waiting for you, or it's not. Either you control your destiny or you don't. Can a pattern form itself other than it will? Do you remember... your dreams? Sometimes. Do you have much fear of arousing hostility? Survival fears? SAPHA: One or two. You eat till you die, Sapha. Then you don't eat any more. 2 Little Man You've Had A Busy Day (Prolonged drum roll) (Cymbals crash) (Smattering of applause) (Applause) MC: Now, the management proudly presents Mr Joseph Sapha, thought reader. (Performer laughs) (Prolonged drum roll) (Cymbals crash) (Smattering of applause) (Laughs) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight it is my very great privilege to read your thoughts. First of all I must affirm I cannot feel the plane on which I live. It's 1:38. Now, for the rational - that is, those who believe or want to establish the difference between in and out, then and now, real and illusory - I'm going to blindfold myself. This room is full of your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen. And not just your thoughts... ...but last night's thoughts, last week's thoughts. Endless thoughts. Thoughts hang around for a very long time indeed, ladies and gentlemen. To be precise, for ever. The name of the eternal reality of all thoughts... ...Is the akashic record. Now, for the doubters and the sceptics, and those who like to think of space as somewhere new to go, I'm going to blindfold myself. This way, I'll be unable to decode any clues trapped in your facial expressions. I'm blind. Therefore, I have no sensory contact with my subject whatsoever. (Distant air-raid siren) MAN: Headquarters have just issued communique number one. In a few seconds, I will read it to you. Communique number one. Right, I'm picking up something. (Air-raid siren continues) It's not difficult to hear. Just hard to find the right station. I'm receiving someone. A woman. Yes, it's definitely a woman. About... five... ...seven rows back. I'm receiving a woman. You, madam. (Gunshots) (Officer barks command) WOMAN: Three minutes. (Officer barks command) WOMAN: Two minutes. MAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen! Gentlemen! I said, gentlemen! So... ...how well would you have to understand history... ...to affect one thread in the web? Events are merely collisions occasioned in the stratosphere. But the unfolding of that event... ...leads back to the source. Are you reading my thoughts? SAPHA: Suddenly I noticed that among the words which he was saying... ...were thoughts being directed at me. He was smiling, but he was provoking in me a very strong emotion. (Phone rings) (Gunshot echoes) Stonewalling you. I'm trying to make you feel you don't exist. No acknowledgment. It's a very effective torture. A small dose weakens the will, and deflects the opponent long enough to give one the ascendency. Stonewalling. Larger doses can paralyse the life force completely. Do you know, with all the... SAPHA: Something began to formulate itself inside my head. But just as I tried to translate these thoughts, everything disappeared. Only love can tell me what is the breadth, length, depth and height. When the heart dies, the door to reality closes. THERAPIST: What would happen if you felt angry? Just keep feeling that anger. Enumerate inside what would happen if you felt angry. SAPHA: Deep in my molecules were memories... ...unscreamed screams... ...soured with years of non-expression. THERAPIST: ..why you're angry, who you're angry with, what have they done? I can't... ...remember. I was drilled to stifle pain. And in stifling pain, I held my breath against joy. The fear of feeling had armoured me against my life's essence. I can't remember. (Slowed-down) No memories. Fear is my cohesion. Letting that go might shatter my existence. No memory. (Laughs) 2 In the good old days gone by 2 Do you remember'? - Oh, I remember. Well, of course you do, dearie, you're much younger than I - Do you remember? Do you remember? - Do you remember?

Who pulls the strings? The government... ...God... your mother... the state? Do you understand words? What is a word? What do you believe in? What is a belief? Who gave it to you? Oh, I can't remember! THERAPIST: I want you to go back in time, and see a scene... ...that made you very, very angry. MALE VOICES: I think circumstances at the time it was committed... ...savaged internal relations... Remember! ...second factor, sort of X is hereditary, Y is... (Explosion) THERAPIST: Begin visualising it now. I see you went into red. So what we'll do is turn on the feedback, which is his signal to relax, and terminate the scene. MAN: Queen and country. THERAPIST: That's it, just relax again. MAN: Check his arse! Check his arse! THERAPIST: OK, relax. Forget that scene. See, the response is very rapid that time. That's often the case as you get down toward the end of the hierarchy. What's your name, chummy? Sapha, Joseph Dmitri. What's this, uncle? Shit and snow? Our chummy's a pusher. Our chummy pushes shit and snow. These your samples, chummy? Had a good night, have you? Where's the shit, chummy - the big pile? - Running from your mouth. - Cut! MAN: ..it will probably take several repeats of that scene in order to accomplish the desensitisation at that point. (Beep) (Beep) (Beep) ...your three dots. (Beep) (Beep) (Beep) (Beep) THERAPIST: Eventually we hope to have him visualise all the items in the hierarchy, while keeping lights green for the most part - that is, keeping them out of the red region which indicates a high tension, high anxiety level. (Breathes heavily) THERAPIST: Do not restrict your breathing under any circumstances, no matter what that means. Where are you now? SAPHA: 11:35... THERAPIST: See the people in the room. SAPHA: His aged, bony face comes back around the light bulb. THERAPIST: What room are you in? SAPHA: I pour my tea and wait for the game to commence. He pours a little of his liquid comfort into a glass and looks down at his very few chips and touches them, almost tenderly. Opposite me, the dealer is spilling his energy by moving his chips into piles, perhaps hoping to magnetise them. I drink my tea... ...and wait for the game to commence. It's five-card stud. It's £100 to play. (Speaks Cantonese) THERAPIST: You are thinking. SAPHA: And I prepare myself to move through the gap in the laws of probability. I snatch his thought as he examines his card. Ten... of clubs. Somehow, he knows something has been taken from him. Bullet to bet. Ace, four. Seven, two. Two eights. Jack. Queen, ten. Eights to bet. SAPHA: The table's energy focuses on the old man's dilemma. Forlorn as a child, his skin is taut and strained. And he touches his chips as though trying to give them life. Then, and in final recognition of the emptiness swallowing him, he rises like a sleepwalker from his chair. ZANOV: To trace the origin of the simplest event... ...we must slow down... ...and observe... ...without judgment. SAPHA: I light a cigarette and close my eyes. And the vision of precognition manifests before me. WOMAN: All right, close your eyes. Close your eyes again. SAPHA: We are each other's murderers. And across the table, the dealer throws a wreath upon my grave. Two sevens. No improvement. Same possible. Two little ladies. Bet's 200. (Chips clink) Ladies, two... with one. SAPHA: As I watch... the insolent boy, too eager to win, the other, blind with greed, I feel my hunger rising. (They speak Cantonese) Three sevens. No joy. (Speaks Cantonese) SAPHA: Confrontation with disaster is etched on his face. And called on by a powerful opponent, he will limp towards his doom. The ladies have the power... for 500. SAPHA: I move my chips to the centre of the table. The climax ts in sight. With 1,000. SAPHA: Three down. One to go. And he reaches in his back pocket for the last of his capital. He feels his collateral draining away. Accusation is written on his face. I'll take a look at it. SAPHA: I turn the hidden card to reveal the fourth seven. You... - He halts me with his hands. - ..on drugs? And his words are like stones in his mouth. The hard stuff? The name of the eternal reality of all thoughts... ...Is the akashic record. Now, for the doubters and the sceptics, and those who like to think of space as somewhere new to go, I'm going to blindfold myself. This way, I'll be unable to decode any clues trapped in your facial expressions. I'm blind. Therefore I have no sensory contact with my subject whatsoever. WOMAN: He is training you as his time travellers. Not across the linear earth, or the moon, Mars or Jupiter... but to the soul... Right, I'm picking up something. ...ease your way through the barriers of the clock. It's not difficult to hear. - He is training you... - Just hard to find the right station. Not across the linear earth, or the moon, Mars or Jupiter... I'm receiving someone. ...SO you can ease your way through the barriers... A woman. Yes, it's definitely a woman. - What time is it? SAPHA: I don't know. - It is impossible for me to understand space... - My watch has stopped. - You haven't got a watch. - If I have no idea of time... I'm thirsty. ...It is impossible for me to understand time. If I have no idea of eternity... (Faint operatic singing) ...despite the splitting of the atom... What's wrong? Nothing. ...I am trapped. I had a funny dream. What was it? I was in a shop window. ...trapped. ..I am trapped. I had no clothes on. ...I am trapped. I couldn't move. Hold me. ...I am trapped. Do you love me, Joe? Do you love me? SAPHA: Dream two. The calling bird is telling me that this life, that I believe to be outside, is simply a reflection in my own distorted mirror. I have fallen asleep in a prison, drugged with fixed ideas, automatic responses and blind beliefs. (Echoing) Automatic responses... (Echoing) Automatic responses... ..blind beliefs. (Applause) SAPHA: Dream one: synchronicity. Both kinds of connection exist in the selfsame event. These coincidences are connected in such a way... ...that I cannot possibly explain them... (Drum roll drowns speech) Very good, Ethel. Smile, Ethel. (Laughter) Smile at the nice people. (Laughter) Now... what were we learning about yesterday, Ethel? I can't remember, Victor. - Yes, you do, Ethel. - No, I don't, Victor. Yes, you do, Ethel. I don't. I don't remember. We were learning about... ...femininity. (Woman laughs) Fem-i-nin-ity. Fem-i-nin... - Good! - ..Ity. Fem-i-nin... Very good! Now, what does the word 'femininity' mean, Ethel? - I don't remember, Victor. - Yes, you do, Ethel. No, I don't, Victor. Femininity means... une femme du monde... ...a lady of charme. And what does a lady of charme do, Ethel? Lie through her fucking teeth! (Laughter and some applause) You haven't learned your lesson, Ethel. Sorry, Victor. Never mind. I'm going to take you to a cocktail party. To a cocktail party? I'm going to a cocktail party! And you're going to meet this man. What kind of a man? Just a man. OK, OK, don't be cross, Victor. Now, where was I? I was meeting this man. Right. This man. He puts his wet, greasy hand on your... And what do you do, Ethel? Smack him! Ha-ha-ha-ha! No... no... no. Sorry, Victor. It just popped out. Why was it the wrong answer, Ethel? I don't know, Victor. Because... ...If you insult this nice man... If I insult this nice man, I'll fracture his ego! And he won't be able to go out into this world. And build a nice house where he can put his wet, greasy hand on me any time he likes. (Cymbals crash) (Siren blares) MAN: Check his arse! Check his arse! FEMALE THERAPIST: Name? SAPHA: Sapha, Joseph Dmitri. MAN: Queen and country! - Date of birth? - 29th of May, 1953. Subjects: Negative energy, incest, and the probability of an event. - Date of birth? - 29th May, 1953. Not the first time, Joe. Not the first time. 1.9 grammes of hash - a piss on the highway. Pretty small stuff. This time, it's not. - What's not? - Small stuff. This time it's not small stuff. Where did you sleep last night? Room 209. THERAPIST: Begin visualising it now. SAPHA: Dream four. I'm in the video room. And someone gives me a code word. I believe this word to be 'scrutiny'. I'm told that I can unlock it, if I can focus with enough mind concentration. Later, the hidden word is revealed to me. It is 'spy'. This tells me I must look into my secret self. Dream four: the transmutation of electromagnetic energy into future predictions. There is no time or space. There is no time or space. ...time or space. ...space. When I got back to England... Where do you get your living, Joe - honest livelihood? I manufacture Valium and gin. And as a sideline, I sell reject birth pills to the Far East. It's legal - 100 per cent. - Where did you get the gun? - From a Christmas cracker. - Look, laddie, this is a lot of money. - What's a lot? £6,000 isn't loose change. It depends... who's carrying it. Where's the gun, Joe? Where's the gun? Lodged... in your brain. See this pencil? How did it get on this desk? Take it back... ...right back to when it was a tree. It was a tree. But the difference between you and me... ...Is you think it arrived as a pencil. - So plead insanity. - What's the crime? Subversion. I know you, Joe. You stink. You want it all to fall. ...the fucking Jew boy anarchist. Without me... THERAPIST: So what we'll do is turn on the feedback, which is his signal to relax, and terminate the scene. (Equipment whines) OK, that's it. Just relax again. Where do you live, Joe? Where I find myself - with you. Where are your possessions? In the bag. - Where's your family? - I'm a world citizen. You have some bad feeling towards me, Joe. It's against my religion to tell people what I feel. (Equipment whines) THERAPIST: OK, relax. Forget that scene. Now let's take it right back from the beginning. You like a smoke, right? I like a drink. We're the same, Joe. We're the same, right? - How do you get a living? - I'm a thought reader. Where did you get the money? - From my mother. - Mother? Where's your mother? In Bolivia. Untraceable. THERAPIST: OK, would you visualise this first item from the hierarchy? Begin now. SAPHA. It is easy for me to accept that this world is moving, flowing, drifting particles of energy. It is myself, as transient as raindrops, flowing into preordained patterns, that is hard to accept. Life, from the first, is bound up with transformation, to be separated and reunited, change form and condition, die and be reborn, act, cease, wait, rest and act again. That is the universal condition of being in this world. You know, finding out about me isn't going to be difficult. I'm not hiding. I've owned up, lost face, or whatever you want to call it. SAPHA: Which one? All of them - colluders, flatterers, controllers, consolers. What do you say you hate most? Cross-examination. (Sighs) Being vulnerable... ...exposed... ...open to attack. Is there a war? I've forgotten. (Static interference) My biorhythms were disconnected at an early age. You come into this room... ...-and there's this man. Is he lying down or standing up? He's lying down. What's he wearing? White. Are his eyes open or closed? - His eyes are closed. - Why are they closed? (Beeping) ZANOV: Begin by dismantling illusions... ...that cling around self-event puzzles. It's a foul habit. And lethal. ZANOV: Watch promises and fulfillment of desire bargains. Desires are never fulfilled. Yeah. Habits are lethal. So, what do you hate most? Security, comfort, property. The con. ZANOV: As soon as you arrive at what seems like fulfillment... And the coolers, employed to persuade you you haven't been conned. And the sex educators. And the love teachers. ZANOV: You are being urged on to the next craving. Craving stops by letting go of craving. So what do you want? Now, if I can find it. Where is it? Squeezed... ...between the future and the past. (Forced, harsh breaths) THERAPIST: OK, don't control the breath with your mouth. Just let it come. - (Breathing becomes ragged) - Angry type. (Repetitive saw-like breaths) (Breaths tightening) OK, go back to your normal breathing for a moment. Feel the state that you're in right now. Now, it's very important to continue breathing, so keep part of your attention at the bottom of your breath... ...and breathe very deeply and very clearly through your mouth. Visualise that symbol. OK, visualise a specific scene of anger. I'll take you down into something. Relax. SAPHA: These imprints, these duplicated programmes in my cortex... ...these concerns, false ideals, and half-remembered phrases. Small lies, big lies. Told. WOMAN: Breathe deeply. SAPHA: Censored. WOMAN: Relax. Relax. SAPHA: Retold. (Muffled voice of woman) SAPHA: Falsifications, identifications... ...that have made of life dead convictions and concepts. While I have been spinning these thought webs, I have been as unconscious as in the state I call asleep. I have been clinging to the phantom called survival. WOMAN: Being vulnerable. Exposed. Being vulnerable. Exposed. Exposed. Exposed. Exposed. No erotic zones. No erotic zones. No erotic zones. (Fading) No erotic zones. No erotic zones... (Birdsong) ZANOV: All sex techniques are manufactured and broadcasted regularly by the network. Message: how to put some feeling into a dead organism, without actually waking it up. How to get some satisfaction, without stumbling on the incest nightmares. Mummy and Daddy ghosts haunt your bedside. So you must learn to get the better of them, and yet suck your thumb at the same time. (Bell tolls) WOMAN: 7] remember'... seems to us like the past. That is, if we are running along a straight line. But try and imagine circles, infinite circles. Then we could be anywhere in an eternal present. (Bell continues tolling) What time is it? Mother. Mm? I don't know. My watch has stopped. Why did you say those things about Father? Things? What things? Why did you say them? I'm tired, Joseph. I don't want to talk any more. You're not tired. You're lonely. THERAPIST: Just a minute ago, you were in a very lovely place. Where was it? It's coming back now. Strengthen it. Mm-hm. That one. Yeah. See it more clearly. Stay with that. Does that place feel uncomfortable? I just told you, I'm tired. JOSEPH: You're glad he's dead. You mustn't say things like that. Not ever. JOSEPH: Why must we pretend? MAN: You're a bitch! A fucking bitch! I don't know. But we must. He's your father, Joseph. He's inside you. He's inside you for ever. (Gunshots echoing) Come on, boy, keep up. (Dog barks) ZANOV: What causes an event? How many factors are involved? MAN. It is not due to lack of detailed knowledge that we cannot make the prediction. If I didn't turn on the light, I should get this interference pattern. If I have a circumstance in which I get that interference pattern, then it is impossible to analyse it in terms of saying it goes to here or here. (Dog barking) MAN: The future, in other words, is unpredictable. (Continued gunshots) ZANOV: ..interlocks with time. ...Interlocks with time. ...Interlocks with time. ...Interlocks with time. ...Interlocks with time. ...Puzzle. . Interlocks with time. ..puzzle. ...puzzle. ..interlocks with time. ..puzzle. MAN: We're perfectly willing to allow that we don't know enough detail, and so we Calculate the odds that the thing will come this way or that way. But here, what we're proposing, is it not, is that there be probability all the way back at the fundamental laws. (Interference) That in the fundamental laws of physics there are odds. Now, open your eyes. Open them. They are open. Then why can't you see? Because I can't remember. You can't remember because you are sleepwalking. Our decisions are not made with our thoughts but with our memories. It is as though one spot of your embryonic essence has been magnetised... and is dragging you into another orbit. ...is dragging you into another orbit. ...Is dragging you into another orbit. ..orbit. ...orbit. ..orbit. ...orbit. SAPHA: I began to be aware that the patterns inside me were beginning to disconnect. By patterns, I mean those cycles or spirals of thought or behaviour which I have been taught to call myself. That deadly enemy of the life pulse. - And it descends upon me... - (Static) ...the realisation... ...that |am not my emotions, thoughts, perceptions or beliefs. I am not what I have done right or wrong... His eyes are closed. ...-achieved or failed to achieve. His eyes are closed. I am not a conglomerate of voices of instruction, education, doubt or derision. His eyes are closed because he doesn't want to look at me. - But this 'I'... is simply space. - He doesn't want to look at me. (Static) - He doesn't want to look at me. - And where the strands of energy cross... ...Is a dot. - And this dot... - I want to kill him. - ...Is the delusion... - I want to kill him. ...called my identity. (Slowed-down speech) - His eyes are closed because he doesn't want to look at me. - He doesn't want to look at me. - (Slowed-down speech) I want to kill him. - I want to kill him. - (Distorted speech) His eyes are closed... ..because he doesn't want to look at me. His eyes are closed... ..because he doesn't want to look at me. ...he doesn't want to look at me. His eyes are closed because he doesn't want to look at me. SAPHA: This is my anxiety survival broadcast... - ..he doesn't want to look at me. -.Ensuring a past-future programming. - ..he doesn't want to look at me. My brain is recreating a negative repeat pattern. I want to kill him. - This is my anxiety survival broadcast... - I want to kill him. ...survival broadcast... ...broadcast... .. my anxiety survival broadcast... ...broadcast... My brain is recreating a negative repeat pattern. ...repeat pattern. ...pattern. ..pattern. My brain is recreating a negative repeat... ...repeat... ...repeat pattern. ZANOV: ..because you are sleepwalking. Would she be committed in a crisis? In a crisis? Would she be committed in a crisis? ...you are sleepwalking. - Tell me about this woman... - (Sobs) ...you are sleepwalking. Would she be committed in a crisis? Tell me about this woman... ..you are sleepwalking. Look into this mirror. ...because you are sleepwalking. Tell me about this woman. Look into this mirror. ...because you are sleepwalking. Tell me about this woman. Would she be committed in a crisis? In a crisis. ...because you are sleepwalking... ..mirror. Would she be committed in a crisis? ..this woman. In a crisis. Would she be committed in a crisis? ..because you are sleepwalking. Would she be committed in a crisis? ..because you are sleepwalking. ..crisis? Tell me about this woman. You can't remember... because you are sleepwalking. (Zanov's words continue to resonate) Your organism can regulate itself. And your ill-educated censor must be retrained. Life force cannot be controlled by your little brain machine. So, the radionic camera and diagnostic instruments have shown that blood retains, photographically, energy structures from the hosts from which they have been removed. There is a continuum which links all living things together... ...so that the smallest cell does not pulsate without its effect being felt in the furthest reaches of the solar system. So, everything being one is not some romantic ideal... but an indisputable scientific reality. When this information seeps into our consciousness, it must change the moral structure of society... ...and destroy the value system of the rational world. ZANOV: Is your broadcast controlled by the network? Listen to your programmes. Observe how much they are automatic or mechanical. If your responses are out of your control, then perhaps the whole world is. Stop thinking about what you believe... ...and be aware of what energies you are transmitting. ...really commands a punctuated clock training that started you running towards the future. The future's a very real place where you suffer. Where you constantly hope, with more effort, you will arrive. SAPHA: At each moment of turning the corner, I catch a glimpse of the eternal process. But I am for ever a half a second too late. ...a half a second too late. (Birdsong) ...too late. ..a half a second too late. But we have penetrated an equation that must move us towards the infinite. And to 'Who am I?"... ...I reply, 'lam here.' THERAPIST: OK, would you visualise this first item from the hierarchy? Begin now. And bring yourself back into the room. Open your eyes slowly. Try and retain that state. Don't work at it. Just let it stay. SAPHA: It has been my whole life's will to decode this puzzle, as though, inside the answer to this equation, was the insurance of that peace of mind that had eluded me. But there is no puzzle. And the mind is never peaceful. And dawn's already here as the stars appear. (Applause) - Do you remember when... THERAPIST: Open your mind's eye and see that scene very, very clearly. See that scene clearly. See what the people were wearing. SAPHA: There aren't any people. THERAPIST: You're alone?
