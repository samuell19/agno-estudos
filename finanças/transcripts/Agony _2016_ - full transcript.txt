On 29th November, a young man murders and dismembers his girlfriend. The head, torso and limbs are found in various dumpsters in Vienna. The motive for the crime is still unclear. You're such an idiot. AGONY The cause for the act was an everyday situation. The daughter comes home from school, and sits down by the computer to surf the internet. Her mother forbids this, so the 14-year-old girl takes a knife and stabs her. Why? Experts have not yet come to a conclusion... That's just horrible. Please change the channel. - It's crazy what some people do. This is better, isn't it? - Well, a little. ...a hotel. Nobody knows us there, so... So let's go there. - Yeah? Hello Alex. - Hi Christian. Further up, in the direction of Retz. - Perfect. Especially if there's snow... - Can you turn the TV down? Excuse me? - Please turn the TV down. I have to study. - Oh, of course. For the make-up exam? - What are you studying? Philosophy of law. - Sounds interesting. Do you know what that is? I think so. What are you studying? Philosophy of law. So, like I said, I could go on Friday at about 5 pm. Perfect, I can definitely arrange that. And I already put the snow tires on, so if there really is snow... So let's take my car. - Yes, that's good. Box. Let's start. Jab. Jab. Jab. Cross. Come on, Alex. One... two... three... four... five, work those guns, six... seven... eight... nine... One more, come on. Ten... eleven... Okay. Excuse me. Hello. Hey, hello. Hey. - Hello. What's up? Excuse me, you're in my seat. - So, ladies and gentlemen... Chris, this is you're last chance right? - Gentlemen... You're studying... - Please pay attention. Hey cutie. Cutting it close. - Yeah, I overslept. In our first session, we're devoting our time to the third part of you're upcoming exam, philosophy of law. - You're coming to the party right? I don't know yet. - What? You have to come. Good morning Miss. Neubacher. Nice of you to come so punctually. Yes, I'm sorry. - You know it won't be easy, right? At the end of this semester, and it's not long until then, all of you will have to pass an exam which... How should I put it... Separates the wheat from the chaff... Dude, I'm so exhausted. I bet you can't even lift a glass. - That's possible. Mini. - Mini. Rock-paper-scissors. Fuck you, man. That wasn't hard. The first thing I'll do when I get home: I'll pick up a glass of water, drink it and then I'll go to bed. What the fuck, what about your bed, you're not going home... Yeah, I'm going home now. Fuck no. - I'm so tired, and I have to get up early. So there's no way. Fuck no. Lets grab a drink. - No, I have to go. I'm leaving. - I'll pay. No. I have to get up early. Hey, wanna hang out? Let's grab a drink, I'll pay. Come on. Okay. Bye. Alex, I've missed you. - Niki. How are you? I'm good, how are you? - Me too. Hey. Hi. - How is she? Niki, wanna go play? She won't sleep. How are you? - Yeah, fine. No need to cry. That's nasty, what did you eat? They finally released you? - Sure. Honorably? - Yea h, decorated. Something wrong? Nothing. Did you learn this in the army as well? We just had to shave our heads. Are you shaving your pussy as well? Show me your muscles. - Please. Come on, show me your muscles. You should lose some weight. Pork knuckles cost less than your stupid shakes. Doesn't even pay off. Let them pay you for working out. Then you don't need a job. I won't be paying for these strawberry shakes for ever. Especially with this weak result. The taxes are so high here. If you move your company to Ireland, you only pay a fraction of that. Hey, whats up? - All good. You okay? See you later. Of course... Now I remember, you're always together. When you see me, you also see hen - You're like twins. Do you live together? - No. No yet. Well... - That would be too close. How are your studies? - Yeah, okay... Hey, should we sit down? - Yes. Good idea? - Yeah. Since kindergarten. Wow, that's an eternity. - Yeah. Hey, have a beer. Thanks. - Sure thing. Hello, cheers. - Cheers. Cheers, Christian. - Cheers, Sandra. Larissa. Cheers. - Cheers. What are your hobbies? - I dance. What kind of dance? - I used to do ballet. Now mostly hip-hop and R&B. - Cool. No... Oh, yeah. What does a turtle do when... No, wrong. What does a snail do when it rides on a turtle? No idea. That's a good one. I like it. Nice house. - Thanks. Cool car. Do you like it? Did you... Did you just come? Yeah. I was almost there. This can't be happening. Christian! Christian, you can't always leave your dirty dishes lying around and expect me to clean everything. Is that really too much to ask? You know what? Why don't you get your own apartment. Or go back to your German Grandma, with your leased car if you don't like it here. You could have studied in Germany as well. If you had had better grades. ...my best friend let me down, and that guy was me. But I can't rant anymore, because he's dead. He ruined everything, he fucked it all up. The worries, the paranoia, he skillfully left them to me. My future is the street. You like me? I hate myself. What an asshole. He just can't leave it alone. No matter where I go, I'm in his street. You're an asshole. You don't learn from mistakes. You're an asshole. You don't take mistakes seriously. You're a bastard. I dreamed you were gone. You're a bastard. I'll get rid of you today... ...I'll stand by my people, you can be sure of that. This is Bossa Nostraand Die Vamummtn for life. The people are pissed at us again. And when this turns into a DMC, you can be sure of this: Mistakes are made for life... Boom, man. Oh man, that's just sick. Boom, knockout, man. Face pad, mother fucker. He really goes for it, man. - He'll stay there for a while I bet. Another one on the ground. Unbelievable. Alex, what are you playing? Shut up. I wanted to show you something. - What? Look, your ex-girlfriend. Hm? - Look who's tagged on the boobs. What's up with this shit? Look at the comments. What David posted. I'll beat him up. You have to admit that she's hot. - Shut up. Don't shit your pants, we'll see her in the park soon. Let's give her a beating. I'll kill them both. Listen man, I'll... I'll show you something. Give it to me. What now? Just listen. Yo, Jassi. You unfaithful slut, you dirty bitch, yeah. You're so dirty. You ugly slut, you're a lost cause. This is just for you. Listen carefully. - You're too cool. Yeah. Yeah. Why do you do this to me, you dirty tramp? You're dead 'cause I'll destroy you with this track. It's over, you're finally history. This song will leave some ugly scars. From now on you're just my ex, you filthy pig. Look at me rapping on this track, wow. You're just a miserable bitch, so do what you want, slut, fuck to get high. - I can't take this. Turn your hobby into a career. From slut to whore, forever cursed. You're not a whore, I'll agree with you there. A whore at least demands money. Don't blame me, it's not my fault. Every day is open house with you. Everybody can take a look between your legs. The whole city knows who I'm talking about. Leave me alone, leave me in peace. I don't want anything to do with you, whore. Jassi, you slut; Jassi, you cunt. Fuck you, whore. Why am I doing this to you? Why am I doing this to you? Yeah. My vodka. Why am I doing this to you? Because I despise whores. Now shut the fuck up, you useless slut. There's nothing left to talk about. You needy cunt, you fuck everybody. Screw you. Jassi, I hate you. You want to be faithful to me, but you can't do it. No problem, don't worry about it. Now you're in the Guinness Book of World Records. This woman had so many dicks inside her, that you think: "Oh my God, she's insane." So many dicks were in your hole. Yes, I can say that, because I'm the boss. You fuck your way through the Echo parties, and the worst thing is, you do it all for free. Everybody can take a look between your legs. The whole city knows who I'm talking about. Leave me alone, leave me in peace. I don't want anything to do with you, whore. Jassi, you slut; Jassi, you cunt. Fuck you, whore. Gangster. You're such a gangster. We're not together. Just leave me alone. Listen man, they're not worth it. Want a smoke? - Why should I stay here? Hey, no... Stop it. What would you do? Would you hit me or what? You're such an asshole, just leave me alone. Stop it. Stop it, please. - What the fuck? Stop it. Alex! Motherfucker! Young man? Yes, Gentlemen? - You know what you did wrong right? Actually, I don't. - You crossed the street at a red light. Be more careful next time. I'm sure it was green, I'm not stupid. You're not stupid? It was red. And if you continue to be like that you can pay the fine as well. Why the angry look? Got it? Is he nuts? Stop. Stop right there. I told you to stop. Don't touch me! Are you crazy? Will you stop? Are you trying to provoke me? Are you insane? What's wrong with you? Do you like it? Very good, thank you. How did you make it? - Oh, it's not difficult. Sandra told us you're at the university together? That's correct. Did you start at the same time? - We did. How old are you? 24. And after university? Do you know what you want to do? Yes, I'll apply to be a judge. That's difficult. Only a few people get in. Lots of exams, lots of work. And lawyers make more money. - That's not everybody's priority. I don't care about the money, I want to assume responsibility. Christian's father is a lawyer - Please sit down properly, Sandra. At which firm? Sch√∂nborn. - That's a good law firm. What does he do there? - Trademark law. I thought Kretschmann does that? Him as well. Georgie used to work there. - How is he? Is he doing better? No. He'll be in a wheelchair all his life. God, how awful. Georgie is a... Sandra? Sandra. Are you finished? - Yes. Georgie is a good friend of ours. He had a climbing accident. How many meters did he fall down? 30 meters. Onto a frozen lake. Too bad the ice wasn't thin enough. He might have drowned if it was. - I think he would have preferred that to being a cripple all his life. - Horrible. He was really pushing his luck. Your father is here. Is it true? - What? What they're saying. What they're saying. Did you spit at them? I'm talking to you. - Yes, and I fought them as well. It was Patrick's idea, wasn't it? It was my idea. What? - It was my idea. You're such a moron. I can't believe how stupid you are. You're a real hero. Congratulations. And Patrick made a run for it, didn't he? It figures. The idiot gets caught. Whats so great about that halfwit? His dick is so big, it doesn't even fit in my ass. Don't provoke me. Alex, please stop calling. I don't want to befriends with you anymore. What you did was really uncool and I don't need that in my life. Please, don't try to reach me ever again. Bye. Well done. You could work on your cover a bit more, but you're good. Ifs a normal family. The father is a machinist, the mother a housewife. But behind the door, there are often conflicts, even violent ones. This time the mother forbids her 14-year-old daughter to surf the web. Consequently, the girl grabs a kitchen knife and stabs her mother. Experts are tying to understand what makes some juveniles so violent. It is more uncommon for girls than for boys. But one can only speculate as to what her motives were. This is simply: the best music. Hitradio √ñ3. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's good. Thank you for the present. Yes, very. Thank you. I just... How do you know where I live? From Julian? Okay. Good . Yes. Thanks again. And what are you doing now, what are you thinking? Put your glasses on, look how this boy goes through the world. The employment office stopped giving him his money again. He's not even worth a cent to his adviser. He just wears a number like a race horse. That's the reason why people get angry. Because they're treated like dirt, not trusted to do anything. The job center asks "Who do you think you are?" Forget your goals and be happy with minimum wage. You have no qualifications, you're a loser. You want youth work? Go back to the warehouse. You have a forklift driver's licence. I don't think you can do better. You'll always be a loser. You can forget about your ambitious goals. You know what we do with people that complain? Keep yourself warm, I hope you like the rain. I'll make your life a living hell. Gold on the surface, but grey on the inside. Nobody is interested in what happens here. I don't have any money, watch out that I don't steal yours. Fuck your rules, I live in council housing. What kind of bullshit is this? - Don't be so loud. You know it took me two hours to put the little one to bed. You started with this nonsense and I shouldn't get upset. - It's no nonsense. You don't have a clue how other people feel. How I feel, how your children feel. You only think about yourself. I take care of this family, how can you say that? You don't give a fuck about us, that's what's going on. That's such bullshit. I'm here, aren't I? I can't take you anymore Andi, I'm sick of you. It's about me now? - Yes, it's always about you. Aha, okay. And that isn't selfish? You're an unemotional asshole. - We're not talking about feelings, we're talking about real things. - Stop screaming, I can't take it anymore. - What's the matter with you? Well, leave! Do you have a cigarette for me? Fire as well? Thank you. You have to do something now. You're a smart boy. Smarter than your father You can do whatever you want. It's important that you always check what size it says for popcorn and drinks. Hello. - Hello, a Coke please. What size? - Medium. Sure. That's intense. Look, it's Christian. Look. Christian? Hey. 3,40 please. - I didn't know you work here. I'm just helping out, a friend of mine got sick. Oh, how nice. Should I order from you or... From me. What would you like? - Nachos and a Coke please. Then I'll give you the Nacho Box, that's cheaper than both things separately. Yes. - Which drink, which sauces? Coke and both sauces. - Sure. Excuse me. Could I also get nachos? Just nachos or the menu? - The menu. Both sauces? - Yes. Would you also like something? - Nothing for me, thank you. Okay. Would you please prepare the nachos? How's the studying going Christian? - All good. Good? Okay. And then he told you to take a hike? - I don't know... Apparently, he can't imagine being in a relationship with me. Did he call you after that? No. - Are you paying separately? I'll pay. - That would be 15,80. 16. - Thank you. Stylish wristband by the way. And four. Have a nice day. - Thank you. Bye. Thank you, bye. - So... Enjoy the movie. - Good luck with the exam. If somebody wants sweets, in this drawer we have Sportgummi, Happy Cola, Gummy Bears. If somebody wants warm mineral water, we have that down here, with Chips, Snips, Pringles. And if you press the button for drinks, you see the same ones listed, that we have in the fridge. And the M&Ms are also in the fridge, so they won't melt, so they stay fresh for the customers. Wow, look at that monster. Look at him go. - That's nothing, man. He's just pumped up with Anabolic Steroids. Anabolic Steroids? He's been a fighter for 20 years, he's in the UFC. I would totally destroy him. - Ah, okay. Why are you laughing? I can beat him up and you too. Me too? - Of course. Okay. Don't you believe me? - Sure. Why are you still laughing? Come on... Put your cigarette down. - Why? Put it down. Let's arm wrestle. - Arm wrestling? Put it down. - Okay. Come on. Please don't hurt me. - Don't play weak. Lets go. Ready? - Yes, I'm ready. Push. What's up? Yeah, man. That's it. Look at those buttery arms. What's up with that, huh? That's nothing, what you have. - You're strong, yeah. You're strong, congrats. - Look at yourself. What is this? What do you train for? Look at yourself. What's up with that? Look at that. What's up with you now, man? Just because you weigh 20 pounds more than me. Come on, do something. Are you giving up already? Whatever, man. Then A takes pictures of the victim, in obviously sexual poses, to which he forces M. After that he bolts. What can he be found guilty of? Well, rape of course, that can be proven. And also paragraph 201 section 2, because... there is a serious injury: the fractured arm. And maybe humiliation, because of the pictures. No Chris, that's not quite correct. Because of her age, paragraph 206 is more accurate. Because it's for persons under age, so younger than 14. And I would exclude humiliation, because the child is unconscious. It's crass, but that's how it is, you can only humiliate someone... if the person is aware of it. What are you doing? We're in the middle of something. Listen to me. Thank you. And what happens with the pictures is not part of the sexual abuse, but otherwise punishable. Do you understand? What's wrong with you? Hey. Hello. Hey, how are you? - Did you see that? Every time. - Who wants a beer? Every time. - I do. Beer? - Yeah, give me one too. Beer? - Thank you. Cheers. - Here. Everything okay? Hello, I'm Chris. - To drink... Hello. - Hello, thank you. Is that everything? - Yes. I don't have any objections. - Yeah. We also brought something. - Yeah. Was she drunk again? - Yeah, she hooked up with this guy... and they went the bathroom and... Really, that bad? - Yeah. It was really bad, she really outdid herself. Look. Oh, dear God. - This will be interesting. Let's see what he has to say. Can you please come with me? - Why? I want to talk to you. - About what? About why you left me? - You cheated on me. How can you ask that? - Cool. Wouldn't I know about that? - She told me. You cheated on me, Alex. What do you want? - I didn't. Really. - Come with me. Alex, you're dead to me. - Come with me. Don't touch me. - Shut up over there. Stop insulting her. - You have no say in this. Come with me. - No! Come now. - Get lost! Disabled. - Totally. Psychopath. - Yeah. Alex? Alex. What's wrong, brother? Come on, they're just girls. What's wrong with you, you faggot. What the fuck? Stop it! What are you doing, man? Stop it. Hey. Stop it, man. Dude, whats going on? Alex? - Fuck off. Fuck off, you idiot. - What are you doing? Stop it. Summarized, one can say that an investigative custody is only admissible, if a reason to arrest, as stated in paragraph 173, section 2, StPO is evident. But even then, always consider the proportionality. You also have to check if milder measures are sufficient. If you look at paragraph 5, then you'll see that the legislator pursued different approaches... What's going on now? Let's concentrate a little longer, okay? Anyway... If you look at paragraph 5, then you'll see that the legislator pursued different approaches. If the suspect's vow is enough to justify milder measures is unclear. To demand bail from the suspect is far more effective. Okay, I see it doesn't make much sense to continue. But please solve the example at home, next time we will compare the results... Hi. Gr√ºdl posted the grades. Did you see? And? Me too. Kiss me, Christian. Are you working tomorrow? If you are, I could pick you up. The father and brother of the suspect find the dead woman. The police find the distraught girl in a park. In the meantime, the teenager confessed to the crime. She can't explain it though. She says she didn't want to kill her mother. Experts puzzle over the reasons for such outbursts of violence... Turn it down, Alex. But they occur more and more frequently. The intensity... - Can you please go to the store? I forgot the paper cups and the decoration. I'll give you some money. - To what extent this girl... No way, I'm way too hung over. - ...knows what she did... But what I know for certain is that she needs help. Are you serious? You'll go to the store for me. Now. The kids will be here in two hours. I'm sorry. Wait. Here. We still need some paper cups and the... The colourful paper hats. You know which ones. And a few party streamers and Smarties? Come on... Christian. Christian? Can you please open the door? I'm coming. Christian. You left your key in the lock. Can you please take this? Thank you. How was it with Alex? It was nice. Thank you. MOM
