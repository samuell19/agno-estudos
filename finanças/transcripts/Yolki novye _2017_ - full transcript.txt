We are very lucky. We live in the best of times and in the best of countries. Here, for example, in St. Petersburg, as it is always sunny and Borya is still alive. He has a son, a wife and a friend Zhenya. Zhenya usually appears on New Year's Eve, but today is only December 1, and Borya sleeps most peacefully and dreams of pink ponies. "Borya, go open." We caught fire. Borya, what are we going to do now ?! Firefighters arrived on time, but everything burned down. Zhenya, don't worry ... - How can I not worry? How not to worry, like 10 minutes ago I took my own children out of the fire ! Should the little one sing in the subway now? Come on, drink. The shelters for me were rice, I don't know what a home and a native roof is ... Reach out. "Marry, that's enough." Why is this unfortunate drama needed, why did my mother give birth to me at all? My dears, don't do that. You will live with us. Seriously? Boryan, my friend! Come on in, fire victims. We will literally settle in the kitchen. Come help me put in the stove. What stove? - My new passion is bread. Imagine, from the adrenaline 105 kg I did not feel them at all. Did you set the apartment on fire? - Me? No. Force majeure. Come on, pick it up. Weigh! NEW CHRISTMAS TREES I'm Super Igor. And this is the blog "How to train Dad". What does "train" mean? Dad, see how it's done. Dad fell asleep. Father! Igor, are you normal? Dad, are we going to take a loan? - Yes, I will buy a car. Three things you are ashamed of? - The repair ... As you know, my dad and I are celebrating the New Year for the fifth year . But that doesn't mean we're not cool. So we're looking for a mother. So each of you has a real chance. If you allow me not to wear a hat, you have warm and soft hands, and sing Umka's lullaby well . Send us your song, I will choose. Mom, I'm waiting for you. While some dreamed of celebrating the New Year with their mother, Will mom celebrate with us? - others further away from it, Boris dreamed of ending this New Year's nightmare faster. Boris, lift the toilet seat . We live with women. You stuffed it with sugar. You will get diabetes. Bring me the ax quickly. Yes, and the log, roll it here. We will enter the new year with fresh bread, right? So ... Boris, close your eyes, there will be fevers. God forbid. My pajamas suit you. It makes you look younger. You don't mind, do you? I threw mine for laundry. But your pants are tightening. The rubber band kills me, they are not for me. Do you have more? It is time for breakfast. "God, I fried potatoes with onions." For breakfast? "Of course, with butter, not butter." I'm crowded and he's not looking for me until noon. I thought how nice it is that you are still here. There is always something to eat. And most of all a hairdresser on hand. On, take it. Another month with us, and we'll make you human. Will you get a haircut? Sit down, you neglected yourself. Come on after. "Where did you go?" It's your job. And at that time in snowy Tyumen, freshman Andrew, came to stay and eat with mom for the holidays, he had no idea at their New Year's table another guest will join. Mom ... We came, not waiting for us. Who is he? Here, caviar, my arcades sent it from Vladivostok. Yura, I haven't told him yet. "So what are you waiting for?" We are not kids. Come on, introduce us and let's finish. Meet. This is Jura. Yuri ... I don't know your last name. Like Vysotsky. - Petrovich. A hopeless generation. Fools. What? Now they are being brainwashed. They are zombies. They said on TV that they were being zombies on that ... on YouTube. Of course, the idols of a time have been forgotten . Vysotsky, Kikabidze ... And John Rambo knows it. What is this? "Ah, son ..." And, look, can I call you "Daddy" now? You have humor. I like. Give me a fork. Now we both go for the Christmas tree. In the forest. As a father and son. Look, can't you do without a Christmas tree? I have twigs. We will put them in a vase and ... It can not. - Congratulations keep it up! A man appears on the spot. Well, be ready in two minutes. Yeah, like in the barracks. What rank are you? Definitely not an ensign. - What are you doing? I put salt. Be more careful with it, okay? - All right. If I have to, I'll take it in my arms. Come on... Come on, fighter, catch up with me. Look, will you be with us on New Year's Eve ? Yes. Do you have any claims? No, I just asked. - Ah, of course. Where is the bruise under your eye? "I knocked on the door." What? So, I just asked. Why do we go to the forest without a guitar? We would sing ... My dear, sea sun ... Forest sunshine. Forest sun, clear? Clear. Why don't you go alone, and I'll go to the Avers. That's right, great idea! For your ingenuity, soldier, you are rewarded with a jump march and one behind the door. Give me my phone back. Give me my phone back! "They seem to have become friends," Andrei's mother thought with relief . And in the hospitality of Khabarovsk, Egor's father also hoped that his son would make friends with someone. Vitya, the wallpapers have long been replaceable. "We'll change them." Yegor! Meet me, this is Aunt Larissa. "There's time for Auntie." Hello, little one. - Hello. Your father didn't mention you were that big. What are your rough hands. - Right? Of course, it's winter. "Mommy was soft and warm!" Egor! Larissa, sorry, understand it, it's a child ... Apparently it's too early, come on. There will be no "further". Happy New Year! Egor, and what was that? Dad, can't you understand, she's not for us. Egor, understand, we can't find someone like your mother. I will find. I'll find! And for 8 heals. kilometers from Khabarovsk, to the glory of Nizhny Novgorod, the actress from the theater of the young spectator, Marina, he didn't think with whom to celebrate the New Year. No, Olechka Mikhailovna, this time it won't be me. Ah, you don't know, my term is approaching, I will give birth soon. Don't undress, the floor is dirty. Snow White will be very nice, she is my friend. Wait like that. Kalmurat, did you find the wand to put on the roller? Marina Nikolaevna, I told you that I am a cleaner, not a master. Call a brigade. Olechka Mikhailovna, yes. I don't know who Santa Claus will be, but everyone praises him. Yes, don't worry, everything will be fine. The children will be Artyom, Lisa and Kolenka, right? Yes, thanks, Olechka Mikhailovna. Tanya, thank you, you save me. Otherwise, Snow White will have a bigger belly than Santa Claus. See how big and strong he is now. Okay, thank you too. Will you give birth in a private clinic? - I would like. Will you have enough money? "We'll come up with something." Is Santa okay? Well ... Experienced, normal Santa Claus. I will give you the money for the costume after the New Year. And we will help ... help as much as I can. Tanya, happy new year! "You catch me unprepared." Don't worry, you're helping me a lot anyway. Come on, I'll run. Close the door. Here, Kalmurat, is beauty. Damn, the wand! Hold on, Santa. Tanya! Hello, Marina. Tanya, I didn't expect it from you. Couldn't you find another Santa Claus? What the ... ' ' I'm sorry I won't give him the suit. Marina, what are these theaters? Do you think I won't find it? Give me back the suit, please. Come on. - Marina, you're making a mistake. Tanya was looking, just all Santa Claus is busy. I'm doing it for you. To help you with the birth. You are not able to work now. Marina, act like a professional! I can do anything, Kirochka. And to pay for my birth, and to give birth. Anyway, I live without you. Suit, but cockroaches. Marina's ex-fiancé, Kiril, they were so afraid of responsibility that he ran away a few months ago. And in the cold Novosibirsk, the best fiancé Denis, traumatologist at the First Clinical Hospital, was preparing for his most important step. Unsuspecting, his constant patient Galya, he hurried to Dennis for the New Year's duty. They met a month ago when Galya first went snowboarding. And since then she had thought only of him, of Dennis. Prosecutor's office. Simulant. However, do not remove the helmet during the game . Happy New Year! Hello, Galina, how is your leg? - Like New. See for yourself. This is for you. - Thank you very much. I'm not much on them, but thank you. Hi, baby. I am sorry for being late. A drunk stuck to me. He served in Kaliningrad, it turned out that we have common acquaintances. But I immediately told him I had a boyfriend. You have greetings. By whom? - From drunkenness. Don't you listen to me at all? Katya ... - What, are you worried? What are we complaining about, varicose veins? "How does she surpass me?" While Galya from Novosibirsk was looking for the answer to this question, Egor from Khabarovsk was looking for the best mother in the country. But his father still had no idea. ... according to the TASS news agency. The video of the boy from Khabarovsk is gaining popularity on the Internet , who dreams of the New Year not for toys or modern gadgets, and for the mother. - Egor, come here! On New Year's Eve, the whole of Russia literally went crazy over the infectious video of little Egor from Khabarovsk. Adding a spoonful of snow, a long night descends again ... Why, fool, are you not sleeping? Your neighbors have fallen asleep - snow-white bears, fall asleep too ... How can you not fall in love with this little angel? She dreams so sincerely of a mother. And my father is good at it. You will ask, how will Egor recognize his mother? She must allow him to go out without a hat and put him to sleep with Umka's song. We will celebrate the New Year again alone with Dad. So I decided to find a mother myself. She will have soft and warm hands. He will put me to sleep every night with the song from "Umka" about polar bears. Mom, I'm looking forward to seeing you. - Ksenia, 5 seconds to air. 5, 4, 3, 2... Yes, given this story, I can't help but sing to little Egor. And all night long your neighbors - the star bears heroes, shine on distant ships. We wish Egor to find a mother soon. Hi, baby. - Hello. Why were these tears? "I felt sorry for him." My blue-eyed bird. Ksenia, please, this is a fake. They just collect likes. Then he will sing or skate. And then for 30 years he and his father will steal the cream. Please! I don't know, I believe him. They don't look like scammers. Didn't you like your father? Come on, go to Khabarovsk, and your hands are soft, you will warm daddy. - Stop it. Don't start again. Okay, okay, end, I'm not jealous. Really. I am not jealous. I talked to my mom. She has arrived. Look, send me pictures. They have put an arch, three flamingos will come from Sri Lanka. Sochi, casino and resort in Krasnaya Polyana, as he wanted. We're leaving tomorrow, to spend your and my money together. Give me my phone back! - I will give it back. By covering the standards. That NATO is already approaching the border. Hey them, see you. And they still wipe your ass. At your age I ran 20 km. In full combat gear. And at night I screamed at the girls. Yeah, out of horror. "Come on, come on, breathe through your nose." Give me the phone. - Not through the mouth, through the nose. If you reach those pines, I 'll give them back to you right away. We are left with push-ups, slalom between the birches ... We will run, we will spin a few laps. What's the matter with you, Andrei? Andrew, don't do that. Don't die on me now. I promised your mother I would bring you back. Come on, breathe, breathe. Well well well! Damn, sorry about the backpack. Come on. Easy, come on. Mom, thank you, it was my dream to meet Chuck Norris. Come on, Mom, bye, now I'm going to smash bricks with my head. What bricks? Do not you dare! Dad, I think for the first time, red is pretty boring. What meeting? - With Xenia, from the news. Shovel her suitors with shovels. - Not true. Let's not get nervous, but think logically. Is she smart? - Yes. Is she beautiful? Is she famous? So she's definitely not alone. "We'll just meet her." Let's go directly to the television, to Ostankino. You know, who you celebrate the New Year with, you will spend it with. Egor, that's only in fairy tales. So you're not going? "Where?" Is it in Moscow? She better come. "Aren't you a coward?" So, we close our mouths, the topic. Round - march. Thus, Khabarovsk is Moscow. To Moscow only through Novosibirsk? Difficulty not flat Egor. Somehow and Marina from Nizhny Novgorod he always found a way out of a hopeless situation. That is why she assigned the role of Santa Claus to the cleaner Kalmurat. The important thing is to be convincing. Leave the rest to me. We have 2 hours, 14 addresses. We will succeed. While she's looking for a suit. Kalmurat, how is " Tajik Santa Claus"? Kalatunoga. "Kalatuno?" That's enough, is it serious? - I don't know, I'm Kyrgyz. Kalatunoga, you better shut up, okay? Okay. Snow White! How many of you! Please excuse us. Open up! Do Frolovs live here? "They're downstairs." Please, my friend, let me go to the toilet, I'll burst. Close on the way out! - Well well... Thank you very much. Aren't you going to celebrate somewhere? Egati holiday. Okay, happy new year! Once again thank you. Come on, kids, everyone follow me. Do not lag behind. Get together, don't collide. Happy New Year! They are with me. We are for Novosibirsk, we are late. Go one by one. Board charts. Don't worry, stop right now! Quick, pass! - Pass, do not hold the tail. This is a dream. So, now I'm going to wake up. Borya, have you noticed that strangers have been living at home for almost a month, or so it seems to me? - They are not to blame for their problems. What problems, Borya? That he set fire to the apartment and his father flooded his own? The problems are ours, Borya. I have an allergy to dogs, I suffocate, I just die. Olechka, they promised, would be out soon. If they don't leave by tonight, I'm leaving. Olya, tonight is the New Year. Borya, what are you doing? - Uncle Zhenya said, that if the toilet is occupied, it can in the sink. Finish, I can't do that anymore. This is hell. Hello, I'm looking for Evgeni Nikolaevich. I asked before you came to call. For me it is done by recording. "I can't milk the goat." Her udder is firm. Try baby cream, if it doesn't work, then call. I will explain everything to you. I just decided to work from home. You don't mind, do you? What to spend only to the office. Hello. My horse is lagging behind in development. It doesn't grow. Boy, this is a pony. Go away. Come on, come on ... Hey, you're stubborn. Come here, come here I told you. Don't worry, I'll fix them in 2 hours. I'm Dr. Ohbo ... God, Borya, come to your senses. What did you shout? Stay here. Don't go out. What is this? - Borya, you didn't fix it well. Here everything is through fingers. Incompetent work. So, I want you to hear me. - Yes, we are guilty. We will fix it ... I want to tell you ... - Will you argue with me? Come on. Come on, I'll help you. You take a deep breath and exhale ... I want ... - So, you want, go on ... You ... - Come on, don't stop ... We ... Leave! Right now. Damn ... On the day of December 31, in the Kirov region, the city of Khabarovsk, 9-year-old Egor Orlov left home and did not return. All territorial services of the Ministry of Interior have been mobilized to search for him . Weak physique, light blond hair, brown eyes ... And what will Santa bring you ? I asked him for a console. But most likely, as always, I will receive an encyclopedia. Now the 4th volume. You are lucky. And I will get a console. - No way! Yes, I would give everything for an encyclopedia. Even the console. You're crazy! "Let's exchange presents." How so? - What is your name, for example? Vova Mashkovtsev. - I am Egor Orlov. Let it be Egor Orlov and I be Vova Mashkovtsev. And what? Didn't Santa give out the presents by name ? It won't happen. Isn't he so dumb? Dumb, not dumb, he gave me a phone last year. Well, will we exchange? We were lucky with the weather. - Yuri Semyonovich ... Are you okay? What are these formalities? Drive more simply - Yura, Yuri, Yurok, maybe Zhora. Could you teach me some lessons about life in the forest, and I'll shoot it. "This nonsense is not for me." What nonsense? I will upload it to YouTube, you will become a star like Rambo. And he shouted that you didn't know him. No, I do not want. Dear viewers, the boss is with you on emergency rescue activities in the district, Yuri Semyonovich Vnukov. Should I say the prizes? - Rewards at the end, as a bonus. Okay, then. The biggest nightmare in the winter in the forest is the waking bear. If you meet her, you have to scare her. With a loud crack. The thunder. Shouts. Maybe with songs. And what should the songs be? They must be strong, tempo, rhythmic. For example ... I am a lonely tramp Casanova ... I don't remember her exactly. ... Villain heartbreaker ... An eternal lover and an eternal villain, to be exact. Do you know how much the bear is napping? Uncle Jura's Survival School Accurate ax throwing comes from the right technique. Try it, come on, come on. As I taught you. Throw. # СИМПАТЯГА Of course, fools only go once. Damn, you sweated the handle. It is not just a stump, but a chance for survival. Because there are many nutritious larvae in the stumps . Ah, my dear. This can save your life. I ate ... - Don't shoot. You walk through the woods and come across a NATO intelligence squad. You have no weapon, nothing, not even a shovel. But you should always have a camouflage net in your backpack . Look, hop! Do you see me? Actually yes. "Throw me some snow." And I don't see myself anymore, do I? "You're six." I won't teach you nonsense, her! This is called a Finnish candle. In the middle there are cones and a nest, probably of a woodpecker. A man should light a fire with only one match. Gas station. Happens. Stop the camera. I didn't want to reveal all the secrets at once . But a very important lesson. If you get your clothes wet, no matter how, the space blanket comes to the rescue. How to use it? The important thing is to touch more points on the body. Here, it's tight, isn't it? Nothing, if you're a real man, if you lead a healthy life, you will not need a blanket. #DO NOT CURSE Where's my jacket? - How would I know? You hid it. "I didn't hide anything." Give me back my jacket. Another method of attracting the attention of helicopters and search groups. This is only for helicopters ... We enter the battle in a flash. NATOska. - From the Pentagon? What kind of Pentagon are you? Turks, from Pakistan. And they change the center of gravity. This is Punjab, okay? Have you ever been there? No. "And the guys were." I am Egor Orlov, 9 years old. Why are you lying? Tell your uncle your name. Egor Orlov, 9 years old. "Something happened to him, I don't understand." Now we will clarify everything. "No, seriously, look ..." One ticket to Moscow. - Only with adults. Didn't you recognize me? - Macaulay Culkin? Your neighbors fell asleep - snow-white bears ... Umka from Khabarovsk. - Bingo! Great. We will help you now. Did I catch you! Everything alive is looking for you. Come on, we'll take you back to Dad. I don't want to go back, I have to get to my mom. I want a lot of things too, but I'm not running. And why? - When you grow up, you will understand. Girls find it difficult to take the first step. You underestimate yourself. - Yeah right! Who is he, who am I. He is a doctor. - Dr House? You are chaos! Denis. What's wrong? Are you sick? Careful, it's not scary. I'll take you now. Don't worry, we'll take you, I have a brand new Audi Q7. Stop! Thanks, I'm better, I'm fine. No, no, we will not leave you. - No need, we have a car, thank you. Say hello to the girls. I was going to give birth there. Hold on, boss, we have a 40-minute drive to the delivery room. I didn't really mean that. We have work to do. What else do you want, miss? "Please open!" I forgot something in the toilet. There is no Russian salad, but you will have to eat. But please, there was no need. - Enough, and we were treated. What is your name? - Julia. Really? Wow, my favorite name! Yulechka, carry the plates. Well, let's go surrender to the police. You have to go to him. Don't you know who you celebrate the New Year with, you will spend it with. He has someone to meet her. With a cool brunette. Very important, brunette. Look at yourself. Beauty. You have to meet the boy at your place in Peter. Are you looking for Umka? - The animation "Umka"? Yes. Not the animation. The boy from Khabarovsk. We will meet him, don't worry. Thank you very much. All right, come on, bye. So, look, there are no places for Moscow, you will fly to St. Petersburg . There they will meet you and put you on the train. Come on go. - Thanks. We don't have suitcases, so we'll use garbage bags and disappear. By the way, I just ruled out, we have New Year's gifts for you. There is no need, maybe without them. "Son, bring them." Mom, Dad, come for a while. Give it to mom. Of course, it was supposed to happen at 12 o'clock, but ... Come on, it will be now. Together. We will not torture you, there are more verses. No, we liked it. It was impressive. Right, Olya? Thanks. Dad, it's you now. Borya, when I saw you for the first time, I immediately felt like a soulmate. In 1982, Magomaev came to us. I took a Female with me. On the way we bought this globe quite by accident . The first autograph on it is by Muslim Magometovic. There are all the stars. "Here's Syutkin." Here is the Circle. Michael. I know you like him. Here is Igor Vladimirovich Talkov, his little finger. Here are the signatures of the girls from Bonnie M, of course without the man. Of the modern ones, I have Bilan. In my opinion, a talented boy from Kabardino-Balkaria. Is this Zverev? - Yes, unfortunately it was a mistake. I confused him with Malezhik. Borya, this globe is yours now. I don't go to concerts anymore. I leave it to you to complete it. Both Africa and Australia. Stay healthy! I'm giving it to you. Son, bring the main gift. Birch bark bread box. You will keep your bread in it, already in the store ... Surely it costs a fortune? We made it ourselves. - Meaning? The whole family. Dad walks alone to Fox 's birch bark pit . The little one draws the sketch. Olya and mom dried the bark, and I worked with the pyrographer at night . In general, these were the gifts. Happy New Year! "Shall I take you?" Good thing they found Egor, Father Victor thought. Bad only that in Novosibirsk. I am Egor Orlov, 9 years old. Of course, this is not my son. I sent you photos. Peel it yourself. Remember, in the forest you collect the shells in a bag. So as not to attract wild animals. Yes? - Yur. Oh, we haven't heard from each other in a long time. Hi, what's up? Jura, I need your help. My son went to Moscow alone. To look for the TV presenter Ksenia Lastochkina. I need to find her phone. Brother, don't look for the girls' phones once your son is gone, and reported to the police. "That was the first thing I did." Then stand on your ass and wait. Yur, Yura! Finally, say your name. I am Egor Orlov, 9 years old. We're tired of you. "Stop, be quiet!" Why didn't you help him? What is the problem? I was looking in the news for this boy. The problem, son, is that everyone in the forest saves themselves. Hello? - Hello, Ksenia, I'm Andrei. The courier. Sometimes I deliver flowers to you. - Ah, Andrei, yes, hello. I'm not in the studio, I'll take off from Domodedovo. Please excuse me, but I'm calling you on a completely different matter. That boy from Khabarovsk, the video blogger who is looking for a mother ... It's actually flying towards you. Can I give him, specifically his father, your phone? They will be looking for you today. - Andrey ... Don't give my phone to anyone. Goodbye. Ksenia... Do you hear me? Silkworm. Finally learn to play the fans. Well done! For us! Move already. Hello again. Recurrence. "Galina, again?" Apparently she was sprained. It's just that your doors are very tight, and I as I am kekava ... Galya, what is this? Any New Year's joke? I will not give you to anyone. Didn't you tell me? I have not said anything like that. I will not give you to anyone. Very touching. And yesterday and today he forgot me. - Stop it. I'm going to look for the key. He'll find it in the spring, when the snow melts. Hello, is it the police? No, we will not be able to cross the lake . You will ask why? Because. I explain. I am the first! "Wait!" Are you okay at all? Come back! Come back! Do you happen to carry skates in your backpack? Moron. - A? We'll talk on the other side! Here. Wait outside. Captain Chebotarov, I ’m at your signal. Why are you detained? Just kidding. Mr. Officer, a lot of people are waiting for me outside . Can you somehow untie us? And who was the initiator of the nailing? You shouldn't have hurried, he should have looked. I can see in her eyes that she's a fun and decent girl, he must also love to sing. Why do we men run away from our happiness? Eat, of course, but we need a key. I go fishing. It happened, you threw glitter, some shiny imitation, and a carp is hooked. And the next time you find such a nice worm, you even want to eat it, and it doesn't bite. Sorry to interrupt, but we have work to do. You excuse me, daughter, but you're not for him. You're a gazelle, and he looks more like a beaver. You need someone of your kind, a goat, a zebra ... I watched the beavers on TV. So interesting ... Very entertaining, but will you take off our handcuffs now? I need a statement from the victim. - No problem. No, we will go to the station to shape it. It can take up to 3 hours. Clearly, I'm going for a file. I'll tell you one thing, Galyusya, beauty can't be forced. But, Dad ... - Don't be my dad. We will talk at home. He will steal my handcuffs ... Well ... All good. Here we are alone. Next, please! Uncle Yur! Go, I'll teach you some things, skater. It actually hurt me. Well done, soldier. Good cut. With love for nature. Congratulations, you're maturing. Thanks. Where are we going? - I would go to Evpatoria. Are you crazy? It's raining there. Better in Thailand. I was looking at a list of shelters. On Moscow Avenue today is free soup. Can I go to the airport first? Let's meet the boy from Khabarovsk. Well, darling, let's drink to us. Successful birth in the New Year. What is yours? - Boy. Super. And I'm lucky. Come on, for expectant mothers. Let our fools regret a thousand times that they missed us. Mine doesn't know about the child. How come he doesn't know? "Why is he like me?" He himself is like a child. He lives in a dormitory, has no job. And in general, a woman has to support herself. You serious? Yes, this is a third wave theory of feminism. Their ideology focuses on ... the poststructuralist interpretation of type and sexuality. Dependent on men is humiliating. I'll handle it myself. "Maybe you should have told him?" You see, the interpretation went elsewhere. How do you say? - Lyosha Grigoriev. Yulechka, does she live in a student dormitory ? I do not know. "Do you have his phone?" Let's call him. - No, there is no need. Leave me alone! "You have to tell him." Then you will regret it for the rest of your life. This does not affect you at all. Take care of your child first. Will you call? All right, Julia, we're going to run. Meet, this is Egor. The same tramp as us. Come with us to the shelter, Egorka. With pleasure, but I can't. I have to get to Moscow, to my mother. By the way, don't you have any relatives in Moscow? We don't have any, Borya, we have no other relatives besides you . A friend in need knows himself, never forgets you. This is called a true friend. Don't you have other songs in the repertoire? This is her third time. I envy you, Egorka, you ran away from home, and we have nowhere to run. - I would take you with us, but I'm afraid Dad won't let me. - We know such fathers. You should have friends. Everyone should have a friend to help them. Right? Egor's phone limit ran out and he couldn't figure out that Ksenia has uploaded a photo from Domodedovo on the social network. Egor, finally. Where are you? "Hello, Dad." I'm in Peregrine. Train from St. Petersburg to Moscow. So, you're waiting for me at Leningrad station next to the room for mothers with children, okay? I will come to pick you up. - Dad, I have to find Xenia. Egor, nothing will happen, her flight is in a few hours. Then at the airport. "What airport?" You don't even know where it's taking off. "Domodedovo?" No. "Sheremetyevo?" Grandchildren? Not. - Domodedovo? So, Egor ... - Of course, it's Domodedovo. Come on, Dad, a Domodedovo meeting. He will be with Xenia. Bye. "Yegor!" I'm sorry, Andrew. You are 18 and you can't do anything alone. Please? I finished school with a gold medal. How is this relevant? Nothing, we'll get you in the way. - Thanks, but I can do it myself. How am I? Will you keep banging your head against the wall? On the other hand, I understand you, you don't have a father. I have a father. What kind of father are you? You have to drown such fathers in the river. Your mother and she are stupid for catching up with such an idiot. First, who hits you in the back, huh? The guys don't do that. Hit me again. Come on, hit me. What's wrong? Show. Blood. The blood stops easily. Fuck you! - Andrew! Andrew! Are you stupid? Do not enter the forest, you will get lost. Apply this ointment 3 times a day. In principle, the hand should not bother you. Goodbye. Denis Evgenievich, is n't your hand bothering you? Katya, don't you think I like it? - We like it. Why? - When I look, I would not refuse a threesome. Make her leave. "Galya, go away." How do I leave? You are talking nonsense. "Then I'm leaving." No, I'm coming with you. "Your way." We leave, but without her. - And how will it happen? She beats you all the time, she doesn't look like love. Caress, stop caressing me! - No problem. Katya, wait. Galya, don't pull me. I have in my pocket ... Galya, will you help me? Slowly with your hands. You're going to mess with your pants without me, got it? Katya, but I love you. And I don't. See that he doesn't love you. Listen, you ... how do you know, huh? Why did you invent all this, fool? See her, see yourself. Who are you? "I'm your beaver." You, impudent beaver, go build dams. I want to build our home. - Yeah, here. I agree. "This is my whole life." And this is given once and for all to your loved one, do you understand? You have nothing to do with this man. This is not for you! I wanted to make her an offer like people. This is just the coolest New Year. Are we going to wander all night in vain? Tanya, last year we were at the addresses. Do not shout at me. "I'm not calling you." Clear. Here's who stole our orders. Marina, why don't I stay home? If you don't care about yourself, at least think about the child. Wow how worried he is. "By the way, this is my child." If he had thought before you ran after other Snow Whites. Which is the other one, huh? We filed an application in the civil. Tanya! "What?" Really, Cyril? - Really! As for the money, we had decided to give you half. Don't make us beasts. Tell her. What? Here, the other orders are yours. From the fifth block onwards. I wish you good luck. That's right. Then we will bring you the money. Marina! "Leave her, grab the wand." And now where, boss? Come to the dorm. Let's meet Yulka's friend. And we came back. Do not worry. Go rest in the room. We ourselves ... New Year's cake! Come on, kids! I'm dreaming, aren't I? Nearly. Where? Hello, I'm looking for Lyosha Grigoriev. I know what you're looking for. - No, you don't know. You know nothing. He is the father, it is soon the New Year, I will give birth, and he is gone. Let me go, please, good woman. "Come in, daughter, it's on the 4th." Thank you very much. Hello, everyone! Egor Orlov is with you. I arrive in Moscow in an hour. At Leningrad station. I don't know, I have to get there somehow . I need to get to the airport urgently. Hello, brother. Boys! Are you Lyosha Grigoriev? Do you live in this room? Girls, do you know Lesha? Do you know Lyosha Grigoriev from this room? Girls, do you know Lesha? He lives in this room, who is he? Are you Lecha? - Yes. Hello, Lech. You will have a son. Miss, it's not from me, I'm seeing you for the first time. It's not about me. Julia is pregnant. Which Julia? Is it red? Wait, wait, the redhead was Oksana. Honestly, I don't remember any Julia. "Come on, get dressed, you'll remember." Go away. I do not understand what you are talking about. Enough, Leha, let's go. - Play the music. Disappear! - Andrew, do not walk on the ice! In places it is thin. Andrey ... You will fail! Don't go there! Andrew, no! Andrew, don't ... Andrew, don't go ... Hold on! Come back, I'm fine ... Andrew, back! Get caught! "Pull, pull me!" No time to lie down, Uncle Jur. We have to run. We're running. Could you do that in outer space? - Yes, I would. Doesn't it smell like burnt? How are you? "Isn't something burning?" Not everything is fine. Rest. Shouldn't we rent a one-room apartment? To the subway. No, we certainly have a minute and a half. Then there is no escape. Quick, come on, quick! Passports! Where are they? Force Majeure, Borya. I was distracted. Wait. Leave it to me. Let's disappear. How did you find out? Are you my subscriber? My brother called. Haven't you been to Moscow, seen nothing. Where are we going? At Domodedovo. Ksenia. Igor, wait. Do you remember the boy from Khabarovsk? Can you imagine, he saw me on TV and ran away. And he flew to Moscow to find me. Are you kidding? I need to see him. Are you saying you don't want to fly for our wedding? Don't you want your mother and I to scatter petals and chase flamingos? Not funny. It comes from that part of the country. "And now what, tell me?" Ksenia Lastochkina, Egor's father, Viktor Orlov , is looking for you . Please report to the information desk. How does he know you're here? Did he call you? - Igor, don't start. Really I do not know. It must be a coincidence. Yes, it was a coincidence like, "Miracles happen on New Year's Eve." Igor, stop it. He is looking for his son. Sir, put the suitcase. "One moment, okay?" Excuse me. Well, if he's a son, that's another thing. I will not be long. - Yes, yes. Wait for me here. "I'm waiting, I'm not moving." Quickly. - Go. Ksenia! Hello. - Hello. Are you the father from Khabarovsk? - From Khabarovsk. Is it obvious? "No, I just recognized you." You are famous now. You will apologize for making such a fuss. I thought Egor was with you. And he's obviously still traveling here. Of course, he is very brave of you. He must look like you. Yes, he saw you and ran away. - Yes... Not like me. Go, don't wait. Yes, a flight is waiting for me. Give him many greetings. - Mandatory. It was nice to meet you. - Me too. I'm Victor. - Ksenia. Egor guessed, you have beautiful hands. Hi, Daddy. Igor, stop it! "Come here and I'll kick you." I'll give you some soft hands. - Relax. Please forgive us. It's all right, go. I have to wait for Egor. Igor, why? Don't you think they need you for yourself? Because you are kind and good? That you are perfect? No, my dear, no! To them, you are a star. That's all they care about. This is the truth. Thank you very much. Greetings to your brother. I'm here! Finish, I can't take it anymore. Please forgive me. Forgive me, I ... You forgive me. I'm not going anywhere. I do not love you. Egor! Egor! It's not what you think. Wait, Egor! Wait! Dad, Dad, help me! She's after me. He misinterprets things. - What happened? He wanted it. Dad, let's go back to Khabarovsk to celebrate the New Year. I'm sorry, but I don't understand. "He's a child." Let's go back to Khabarovsk. Egor wanted like in a New Year's fairy tale. At first glance, for life, but ... We are great people with you and we are aware. - Of course, there are no miracles. Unfortunately not. Father. Come on, calm down. Two tickets to Khabarovsk. Happy New Year! - You too. You fly far. Hello, everyone. This is my last inclusion this year. We met, she is so beautiful, good, but do you understand ... She doesn't need us. Miracles do not happen. You are an ambulance! How can in an hour? 40 seconds contraction, 5 seconds pause. Boss, this is the third contraction. "How do you know you're not a gynecologist?" I have 6 children in Bishkek, she will give birth in 40 minutes. We will not get to the hospital. - And to the clinic? Yes. We just need a normal car. Yulechka, please be patient, don't give birth yet. Marina Nikolaevna ... Dishay. We need your help. "Haven't you given birth yet?" I will give birth, I will definitely give birth. I swear! But will you help Julia first? He lives here. Go, we will catch up with you. Say that you are under a contract with Marina Zavyalova. This is me. I paid a deposit. Do not worry, I'll be fine. Wait for me to take her luggage. Hello. Excuse me, but where is Julia? She's gone. "It's me, Lesha." Lyosha Grigoriev. Not the one you talked to in the dorm. And he is Lesha. - Hold on. I'm sorry, I didn't know anything, I swear. She didn't tell me anything. And where were you staring, philosopher? I just thought she dumped me. Look, everyone dumps me and ... Stop complaining. Are you coming to the birth, Daddy? Ksenia? Ksenia! I'm coming now. Hello! What happened? Enough, enough, come on. Come on, you'll tell me. Is it? - Lyosha is not allowed without fluorography. How so? "She should at least see you." They said he was on the second ... Lyosha, get in the bucket. Will you be able to lift it to the second floor with the bucket? Come on, pay for the birth and the room. - I will give them back to you. Come on! This is not the room. As you meet her, so you will spend it. Go. Hurry up. There are also good people. It's here! - Hooray! I can't feel my legs. - Who had run 20 km, come quickly. It's ten o'clock, the president is just starting. I love you! Julia, Champion! It's me! Forgive me. "Shut your mouth." Do not breathe through it. What happened? Why are you without a jacket? Wait ... And where is ... Andrey. "Shit!" Forgive me, my dears. - Get up. My legs don't hold me. Katyusha, why are you freezing here? "I'm looking for your key." This is for you. "I wanted to give it to you." Marry him and forgive him. "Forgive me and marry me." Save and preserve. He is beautiful. It's big for me. I give. - Katya, he's not for me, and for the only and favorite. "What is this circus, Katya?" You see, he got up. As in Cinderella - if it happens to you , then you are his princess. Katya, it's not funny. "Beaver, don't worry." You will have the most beautiful dam. Kill Pugacheva. The sound has disappeared, apparently from the fall of the plasma. In a second. Dear citizens of Russia! Dear friends! In a few minutes the new 2018 will come . As always, we look forward to this holiday, we hint at wishes, we make gifts to each other, we enjoy the wonderful tradition to celebrate the New Year in a family circle, with relatives and friends. Why did you turn it off? Was good. There is nothing to deceive. I'm to blame for everything. I applauded everything. Marina, the neighbors said they had taken Snow White to give birth. And I dropped everything and ran. - It's not me, Julia gives birth. Thank goodness! It drove me crazy. Okay, come on, run, you still have time for orders. Cyril, I want to leave all the problems in the old year. Bye. Forgive me, Marina. Yes, I'm a big scumbag! I was wrong! I made a mistake! Tell me what to do? Say it and I'll be back. God, I'm very lucky, Cyril. How? "That he dumped me." Really, this is the best gift, thank you. Then at least let me help you. You will need a stroller, diapers ... I am a 4th wave feminist. I can make sure I help you too. Kirochka! Where did he run to? What happened? Come on, darling. What have you been up to? Tanya! Don't give him cedar nuts. He is allergic. He will throw the cannon. Okay, let's go. Come on, don't suffocate. Great thing we didn't find the key. I want home. "We'll be going soon." First to my mother, then to yours. Without you. I want alone. I want to unbutton. I am bad. I only hurt others. I wanted to be happy, but I didn't think about you. She was so beautiful, with a tan. Chocolate. And I'm a donut. With raisins. Dear passengers, the captain has allowed you to unbuckle your seat belts! The flight to Khabarovsk will take 7 hours and 30 minutes. Come on, sleep, you're tired. We came in vain. "It's not in vain at all." He saw Peter, Moscow ... - Forgive me, Dad. I love you. - I love you too. I only have you. Adding a spoonful of snow, a long night descends again ... They will now sing you this song while you are alive. Don't have happy songs on your phone? I don't have one. Do you want me to tell you a joke? The kind hedgehog walks through the forest, and in front of him are the three rich men. Hello, Ilya Muromets. "Hello, hedgehog." Hello, Alyosha Popovich. "Hello, hedgehog." Hello, Dobrinya Nikitich. "Hello, hedgehog." Yes, come on. I'm having tea. - Happy New Year! You haven't gone fishing with me yet. What? We will go in the summer. Summer ... Although ... Wait, take your time, another week and we'll be together. My Yulenka. Goodbye, horse of Alyosha Popovich. "Goodbye, hedgehog." Goodbye, horse ... - To Dobrinya Nikitich. Yes, to Dobrinja Nikitic. "Goodbye, hedgehog." The twigs are just lovely. This scent of resin. The New Year's mood is all over the apartment. Ali Baba and the 40 robbers come to meet him . Hello, Ali Baba. "Fuck you, hedgehog, we're late." Let's go home, huh? What? I have already finished the repairs. I wanted to move after the holidays, but if that happens, it can now. Ah, you bastard. "I wanted it to be a surprise." Happy surprise. You can live as long as you want. We will be roommates. Shouldn't we stop by Dad's first? He has a key. I'm all this already. This is her, Mom. Mom! Happy New Year! Hooray! Translation and subtitles: KRASIMIR SEVOV Edited by: DESISLAVA KICHEKOVA http://subs. sab. bz Translator's Heaven 2018
