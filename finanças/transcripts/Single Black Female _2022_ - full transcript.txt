Where'd you hide the body? - Monica: Ha ha. - Really, mrs. Fletcher? It's 8 a.M. Calm your tits, it's just a little peach schnapps. You know, I swear I'm gonna come over there one day and make you something other than a liquid breakfast. No, you not. I don't have people in my house. I hate company like I hate people in my business. Monica: Mrs. Fletcher, your door! Ooh! Oh, yup, I'm sure that's safe. Bye. Bye. Monica: This is probably a good time to tell you that andre and I broke up. - What? When did this happen? - Where was I? It happened a few days after the funeral. What happened? Long story short, he cheated. How'd you find out? Girl, someone dm'd me a picture of him having sex in club savoy's bathroom. I'll have to see it to believe it. I'm not showing you a picture, be. No. Sorry. Your father, and now this? Are you okay? - You know what, be? - I actually am. You know, I woke up this morning, and all I could think about was what's next for me. Okay. Yeah, and hopefully that's tea time. But yeah, it's time for me to chase my dreams without any fears, like my dad would've wanted me to do. Monica: Now, that's true tea. Elodie price: Pinkie's out. And as always, thank y'all for tuning in to kqnb's hey h-town. - Hey hey, y'all. - Hey hey. Director: And we're out. - Elodie: Woo! - Yes, oh, that felt so good. Yes, she is back. Monica: Mm-hmm. Tell you what, it is so good to have you back. It was not the same without you. - Oh, stop it. - Seriously. - Nice show, ladies. - Thank you, ms. Rochelle. Thanks, clark. - Monica: Yeah! - Oh my god! Monica: Oh my god, I'm so glad I didn't know clark was watching was watching us. You're already imagining yourself spinning in her host chair, aren't you? What? No. - It's okay. - I've been doing it, too. Her longevity, I mean... The power to call her own shots? Yeah, I want that kind of career. I'm going for it, and you should too. - But, let's just make a deal. - Okay, what? Promise me that whoever gets it, we won't let it affect our friendship. Oh, absolutely. - I gotta run. - Okay, girl. - So glad you're back. - Yes. Hey, hey, hey, hey, let me help you with that. Uh, okay, uh, you're new. Actually, um, I worked in the control room for over a year, and then got promoted to floor director when sam went to early retirement. Aka went back to rehab. Well, his secret is safe with me, I love sam. Alright. It's your job. Alright. Gotcha. - Thank you. - You're all done. Thank you. - Oh, eric. - Eric. - Eric lawson. - Eric lawson, thank you. It's my pleasure. - Excuse me. - Jeff, can we talk? Jeff: Of course. Actually, I'd like the host spot on tea time, and I wanted your advice on what I could do to improve my chances. Truth be told, if it were solely up to me, tea time would be yours, hands down. You work harder than anyone here, and your charisma's undeniable. Monica, you're a star. But, of course, some people will say the same about elodie. Well, elodie's a great choice, too. See that? That humility? That's gonna lose you the job. You've gotta be assertive, monica. Solo hosting your own show is a big responsibility, and you've got to prove to the higher-ups that you're up to the task, that's my advice. Show us what you're made of. So, in other news, your assistant, nate, quit. - Wait, what? - When? Why? I guess you can only be a low-paid intern for so long, but don't worry, we scrambled and found somebody to replace him. Whoa, without my input? I know, feel free to fire her if you don't like her, but I'm pretty sure you will. Monica: Oh my god. Let me introduce you to her, come on. Monica, this is simone hicks. Simone, monica harris. Hi. Uh, sorry, hi. - It's nice to meet you. - Likewise. Wow. Side by side, you two actually look a little alike. Wow, that's such a compliment. Let me show you my office, just... Simone: You really paid your dues. Starting out as an intern, giving your blood, sweat, and tears to this station. Even before you became a tv host. Nobody, not even elodie price, can hold a candle to that. I even know how you like your ginger tea with honey, and not sugar. I did my research. I'm sorry, did I do something wrong? - No. No, it's not you. - Please, sit down. Okay. So, enough about all the research you did on me, tell me something about you, simone. Oh, there's not much to tell there. Um, came here from virginia a couple of weeks ago. Virginia? Big leap. Yeah, I'm still apartment hunting. Well, welcome to h-town. I take it you don't have any friends or family here? - Yeah, family. - Pretty distant, though. I'm going to look for an apartment later today. Well good for you, I hope that pans out. Me too. - Uh, is everything okay? - Yup, just my cheating ex. Sorry. You know what? I think you should take the rest of the day off. Yeah, we can start fresh tomorrow. I'm all ready to start today. That's okay. I have some things I need to handle anyway, so. Tomorrow. Alright, thank you monica. - Okay. - Nice to meet you, simone. Monica? Sometimes to see the rainbow, you gotta put up with a little rain, right? I'll see you tomorrow. ♪ Eric: Hey, I ain't ever seen you before. - First day. - Well welcome, first day. I'm eric lawson, the station's floor director. I'm simone hicks, monica harris' new assistant. Oh, that's good to know. Well, I'll see you around, first day. See you around. Hey. - Elodie: Yes, I know. - I know! Uh, yeah. She came back today. Of course she wants tea time. No, I'm not worried about her. The network loves me. Babe, the gig is as good as mine. No, I would never tonya harding her, or would I? Yeah. Okay, yes. Okay, bye. I love you. ♪ You don't look like no doordash. Oh, no, I'm not. I'm here about the apartment vacancy. Apartment vacancy? The realtor said that you were... Do you see any signs out here? Looking for a tenant? Well I'm not. Somebody done lied to you, little girl. Go on now. Please, ma'am, I really... I really need a place to stay. I ain't taking in no strays. Please. Maybe I can get you to reconsider. Peace offering, and I can't stay long. Hey mom, I'm really busy, what's up? Listen. Look. I know that sometimes I can be a little hard on you. A lot hard, and all the time. With your father gone, honey, it's just us. It's just you and me, and I know he would want us to work on our relationship. You know he would. Monica: Come in. Eric: I have the final rundown for tomorrow's show. Thank you very much. - How are you? - Hi! Yes, you should meet my mother, actually. This is denise harris. This is eric, he's our new floor director. - Very nice to meet you. - It's my pleasure. Monica? You are not thinking about a workplace romance, are you? I don't know what you're talking about, mom. Mm-hmm, okay. Don't know what you're talking about. - I have a lot of work to do. - Uh-huh, I bet you do. - I'll see you later, dear. - Okay. - Love you! - Love you, too. You got me waiting outside? I can't even come upstairs? Really, monica? So what, now you think I'm a threat or something? We're meeting here for your safety, andre. Here's your stuff, have a great life. - Monica, look... - What? - Hear me out! - What? Go ahead, explain. Explain how you made me believe that you were really in love with me, just to turn around and cheat on me a day after my father's funeral. Go ahead! Despite what you saw in that photo, that wasn't me. Is that what we're doing? All I remember is drinking with the guys at carter's bachelor party, and next thing I know, I just... You fell inside another woman? I guess. Sorta. - Oh my... I can't. I can't. - You know, you're a much better actor in those commercials. You know that, right? What? Come on, monica, don't play me like that. - Play you? - Don't play you? Andre, you played yourself, okay? Matter of fact, you don't deserve this. This? You don't deserve! Or me! Come on, monica! Monica: Get the hell out of here, andre. ♪ - Simone? - Monica? Both: What are you doing here? Well, I live here. This is the place I was telling you about, that I was going to look at. - Really? - That woman? No, I just spoke to her this morning, and she was going on about how she didn't like company and hated people in her business. She never ceases to surprise me, I swear. Well, I guess she love money and the two bottles of vodka she asked me to get her earlier more than she loves her privacy. She said she was gonna be gone for a few weeks, pretty sure she's going on a bender. That doesn't surprise me at all. Uh, hey. I'm actually going to grab something to eat. Did you want to join me? Thanks, but no. I don't really have much of an appetite. What I could use is a drink or ten. I can always steal a bottle from mrs. Fletcher's cabinet? I mean, the woman won't miss it, it's like a liquor store in there. Mm-mm. Um, okay. Under one condition, you have to drink with me. Misery loves company, and drinking by yourself is pathetic. - Okay, okay, I will. - Okay, alright. I'll leave the door unlocked, just come on up. Okay. Girl, you took his t-shirt back? I sure did, and I should've did more than that. What he put me through. What would you have done? Man, destroyed everything and anything that he loved until he didn't have a shred of happiness left. Okay. - I'm just kidding! - Oh. I'm kidding! I mean, what did ms. Michelle obama say? Okay, "when they go low... we get high. Oh, she said, "go?" "Go," high. - Monica: Drink to that. - Simone: Here we go. - I'm not there yet. - Neither am I. But you know what? I'm actually proud of myself for leaving andre. It would've been easier to stay, I could've just got my sis bebe to slash his tires, break some windows, but... You have a sister? Oh, no, we're not real sisters, but um, we go way back, you know, we've been friends since, like, the fourth grade, so she's family. Like, yeah, that's my girl. Simone: You're much prettier. I recognize that man. Uh, he was a mayor, right? Before he got term-limited out, mm-hmm. Talk about friends in high places. - That's my daddy, simone. - He recently passed. It's been, it's been a lot. That explains the sad face. I'm so sorry, monica, I didn't know. Monica: It's okay. Well, from what I read about him, he seemed like a great man. He was. Well, what was great about him? Monica: That's a good question. My dad was, um... He was kind. He wasn't afraid to make, like, hard decisions. You know, no matter who disagreed with him, you know, he did what was right all the time, and he was just the perfect dad. He was perfect. - Hm. Hm. - Monica: What? Oh, it's just, you know, in my life path, I've found that nobody is perfect. He was. To me. He was perfect, and I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. - Oh, oh monica, okay. - I'm sorry. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do without him! - Simone: I'm here. - I'm here now. Hey! How you feeling? Like hell. - Well, not for long. - Here we go... Now this, all the hangover essentials I thought you needed, for work. Work. Yup. You didn't have to do all of this, simone. Um, don't take this the wrong way, but how did you get into my house this morning? Oh, you're serious? Oh, after a much needed emotional release, you begged me to stay. - Emotional release? - Like, I cried? Like a baby. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I'm just glad that I was here in your time of need. If you're looking for an early pay raise, it's above me. Okay, alright, I'm gonna head back to mrs. Fletcher's so I can get dressed for work. Uh, simone? Shirt. Oh. It's a little sweaty, sorry. Mm-hmm. Just chill for a second, I'm gonna go, um... I got you. Okay... Yes. So, I'm getting rid of some pieces, and I don't know, maybe you can take them off my hands. Yeah! Oh my god, this stuff is so gorgeous. Why do you want to throw it away? Sometimes you gotta get rid of the old to welcome in the new. But yeah, it's all yours. Okay. Oh, this is beautiful. Oh no, no, no, no, no, that wasn't supposed to be in that pile, I'm sorry. Um, my dad, he... He bought this for me. He said it looked gorgeous on my dark skin, and I just, I don't know, I could never part with it. I'm sorry. But, um... This one, yes. This one here, this is a good one. Yeah, I think this will look amazing on you. Yeah. Uh, monica, can I talk to you about something? Monica: Yeah. Um, yesterday I overheard elodie price being pretty shady about you and hosting tea time. Wait, what did she say? She was saying stuff like you're not any competition, and she would do anything to get the show over you. Uh, okay. Thank you for telling me. - Of course. - I'm your assistant now. I got your back, always. - Ooh, mrs. Fletcher. - You stink. There's a lot of stuff in here... What? No way. Wow. ♪ "when they go low, we go high." Michelle obama: Chapter two... Uh, ma'am, you're interrupting my becoming session. Becoming what, girl? Somebody who ain't texted back their best friend? No, my new assistant got me michelle obama's audio book, honey. You got an assistant that buy you gift? Sound like my type of girl. Right? She makes a mean breakfast, too. Bebe: Come again? Oh, right, I've been meaning to tell you, my new assistant moved right next door, in mrs. Fletcher's house. She came over, you know, we kind of got to talking and drinking, and that's all I really can remember, but she was there when I woke up, so. So, your new assistant spent the night at your house? You don't think that's a little bit too work friendly, monica? She's my new assistant, not my new best friend, bebe. I'm not worried about that, that position been filled for years. I'm just trying to call you because I got some tea to tell you about my dating adventures, but I found someone I like. Oh, really? Yes, he's an engineer, south carolina university, he's sexy, he's smart, and he ain't no liar. And I know, because I did a background check on him. - Bebe, a background check? - Really? Girl, you're crazy. I am crazy. That's me. Do you think that's why I ain't got me no man, though? Oh no, no girl, of course not. You know, I heard monica was a tough boss, but making you stare at her picture like that? That's like a whole 'nother level. You look good in this blue, by the way. Oh, thank you, it's a new dress. Yeah, well that's definitely your color. Were you headed somewhere? I'm actually kind of lost. Monica's not here yet, and I don't know where to go get a good cup of coffee. Well see, you're in luck, because I'm in need of a pick me up.

Well you can come on in, then. Alright. Where do you want it? Right here's fine. Here's your drink that you ordered. Well, look at you. Girl, you look stunning. You are wearing that dress. - You like it? - Monica: Yes. Well, it's from a private collection, maybe you've heard of it, chez monica. Familiar. Look, it is a long way, and way nicer than any thrift store I been to back home. What part of virginia did you grow up in, again? Oh, well see, I tell people richmond, but I'm really from like a little pin dot next to richmond, that nobody's ever heard of. - Okay, alright. - Born and raised? Yeah, just me, my mom, and my grandma, that's it. What about your father? - Uh... - Never met him. I'm sorry to hear that, simone. Oh no, don't be. You can't really be sad about somebody you never met, right? Monica: Daddy the tooth fairy. - Oh. - Oh my goodness. Do you know how much I was teased and how many fights I almost got into for believing in make believe for way too long? Well, I hope you don't blame your father for that. He just wanted to make you happy. There's nothing wrong with somebody caring about you so much they want to shield you from the truth. Yeah, I guess so. - This is so nice. - Yeah, it is. As a matter of fact, I need some of that shielding right now. Why? What's the matter? After smiling all up in my face, elodie, I don't think she's the friend I thought she was. Simone overheard her talking bad behind my back. Simone? Oh yeah, simone, she's my new assistant. Yeah, the station finally hired another sister. - Oh, really? - Yes, mm-hmm. She's from some backwater town in virginia. Oh, virginia, oh. Monica: Yes, and she dresses like a mom. Oh my goodness, I couldn't take it.

Yes, and if anyone else would've given them to me, - I would've kept them. - Really? - Really. - Wait right there. Don't... An exquisite bouquet for an exquisite lady. Exquisite? Oh, you shouldn't have. For me? - You're too much. - No card? - No card. - But, I do have a question. Mm-hmm? Okay. Would you go out with me? Now how could I say no to a guy with such great taste? Thursday? Thursday. Thank you. There you two are. So, got somebody here who wants to have a word with you both. - Hi ladies. - I got this, jeff. I know you do. I'm not naive enough to believe that I have any say in who's going to replace me, but I wanted to have a little face time with the two women who are vying to do so. Well, you're irreplaceable, ms. Rochelle. I like you. Well, luckily for me, when monica was recently out on vacation... Vacation? I was grieving my father's death. The viewers got a taste of how I would and could carry a show on my own. Tea time with elodie price has a distinct ring to it, don't you agree? No more distinct than tea time with monica harris. This feistiness between the two of you, it'll serve you well. I wish both of you luck, and may the best woman win. - Elodie: Thank you. - Monica: Thank you. Have you lost your mind? What the hell was that, elodie? What happened to our promise? Oh girl, that was just some fun shade. Friendly banter between two friends. Friendly banter? You called me grieving my father's death a vacation. Please, it was just a little dig, monica. Don't be so sensitive. Only one of us is going to get that job, and we can't always play nice. Yeah, obviously not. Elodie: You really need to toughen up. You'll be better off if you just admit you don't have what it takes to do the job. Okay. Okay. Bebe: The party is here! I got me a bottle, I got you a bottle. I didn't get you a bottle. I didn't know you were here. Thought it was just us today. Okay, well, you know simone is new to town and she doesn't have any friends, so I figured she should join us, alright? Right. Monica said that you wouldn't mind. - Monica: Yeah. - If you said that now, okay. I'll take these. Thank you. - I heard so much about you. - Likewise. I am so happy that the women in my life are finally together. That didn't sound right. Ooh, alright guys. The wine is almost gone, who's thirsty? Besides you? Yeah. You know, mon' said that you were really funny. Mon' said I was funny? Monica: Alright, let's go outside. So, what do you think about the whole elodie situation? What elodie situation? Okay, so simone thinks elodie has it out for me at work. No, not thinks, knows. Monica: No, I just think it's elodie being a little overly ambitious, that's all. I trust you. I know you can handle your own, keep it cute. Hmm. I mean, but isn't that the point of having girlfriends? So you don't have to handle things on your own? When exactly does ms. Fletcher come home? You know, that is a good question though, where is ms. Fletcher? - Um, texted me today. - Ms. Fletcher? Text you? Yes. She said she was extending her trip. - Where? - I don't know, bebe. I was taught to mind my own business. I find that when you get into other people's business, you get into some trouble. And you know what I find? That when people run they mouth too much, they cause trouble. Or people who date their friend's old ass uncles, because they can't find love. No she didn't. Monica: Okay, alright, it's time to wrap this up. I think we've had too much to drink. Thank you. Thank you, simone. - We can wrap it up. - Alright. Bebe: Yeah, that's a good idea, bye. We don't need that, either. Good night, monica, see you tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay, I may have said something about the older men, but the love part she made up on her own. Simone: She has me now. ♪ Hell no. So wait, you think simone did this? I don't think she did it, I know she did it. That lady's crazy, she ain't working with a full deck. Hm, interesting, that's exactly what they used to say about you in high school. No, I'm good crazy, you know? She's crazy-crazy. Big difference. Well... Huh. I see who burned your face out. - Who? - You did. Oh. Okay. Strong possibility I did that, okay? Mm-hmm. But being serious, I don't trust her. She's like creepy. The way she looks at you... - Be, you're overreacting. - No, I'm not, I know what I see. Before you go writing the girl off, just give her a second chance, before you sage her out of our lives. Alright. For you? But if she kill me, I'm killing you. What is that? Well, you was out of sage, so I used lawry's seasoning because they said that that was good on everything. Do you like it? Girl, move. - Smell good. - Good crazy. Monica: Hey, what's going on? Elodie was attacked last night. What? Is she okay? - She's beat up pretty bad. - Oh my god, that is terrible. Um, do they know who did this to her? No, no, not yet. The higher-ups want to know how you feel about flying solo today? - I think I can handle it. - She covered for me. Whoa, no, hey, look at me, look at me. No, okay? I'm gonna let them know they need to air a rerun. - Okay. - Okay? - Thank you. - I'll be right back. Monica, I just heard what happened. I can't believe it. - I know, it's awful. - I know. Oh my god. ♪ Um, can I have everybody's attention, please? Can we all gather? Thank you. Look, I know that we are all devastated by what happened to our good friend and colleague, elodie. And in light of the situation, we will not be going live today.

Nothing like mine, let me tell you that. But you can tell a lot about a person from their room. Oh, see, take this picture for example. See, this picture, this tells me that you came from a loving family, parents that loved you. Aw. Aw, look at this. See, this tells me that you were taught to love yourself, and the skin that you're in. Gross. Come on. Monica, pick up.

'Cause if you were, you'd already be here, bff. I got you. Chimes! I really thought things would be different for us, monica. I thought his death would bring us closer. But if I can't have my dream family in life, then we'll all just have to be together in death. Why hello, mrs. Fletcher. I'll take that. Formaldehyde. Monica, what? Simone, I didn't know. I wish I would've known we were sisters. I would've chosen you over everybody. It's not too late. I could still choose you. - Really? - Really. Now, can you please tell me about your mom and our father? Because I don't know. I don't. They met on his, uh, first campaign. You were just born. And they were working together out in d.C. My mother said they only slept together once, but that's all it took to have me. Simone: You know, they paid her a lot of money to keep me a secret. Didn't they, denise? Didn't they, denise? On the anniversary of her death, he called out of the blue, said that he wanted to meet up. I couldn't believe I was finally meeting him. And he was everything I always imagined he'd be. He was handsome, and nice, and funny and smart. The perfect dad. Just like you said. He said he was sorry about not being there for me when my mom died. Wished he could make it up to me. I told him he could, that we could be a family now. And you know what he said? Me coming into y'all's lives now would be bad for your reputation. So when he wasn't looking, I got payback. He broke my heart, so I stopped his. You probably hate me now. Monica: Simone, simone, no, I don't blame you. We can fix this. We can fix this side by side, together. Harris sisters. Harris sisters?
