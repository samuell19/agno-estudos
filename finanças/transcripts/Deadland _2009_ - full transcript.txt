Hey, Katie. I don't-- I don't really blame you for not answering. I know you needed some time for yourself. Just-- It's been a couple weeks, and so I just-- I'm, uh-- I'm gonna go ahead and come to Georgia. I'm-- I'm not flying or anything, so don't worry. You still have a couple days to yourself. And I probably need the time, you know, to kind of think about it. Uh, like a perfect, great way to tell you that-- Shit. He had previously declined to comment at all. Now, turning our attention to Los Angeles-- Hey, man. At least tell me you have a phone I can borrow. We have Steve Abney with a report. He's handling what's going on in Los Angeles right now. Steve. It is pandemonium here in Los Angeles, as news of bombings-- You guys don't get very good reception down here, do you? ...West Coast in a frenzy. With the news coming down this morning of all air service... into the U.S. being suspended and the terror level now reaching red, the millions of Americans trying to evacuate-- Los Angeles... are just gonna have to hope that they've got everything that they need... and that the retaliation against this country-- Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. My bag. Where is it? I'm sorry, man. I was hungry. I thought you were a drifter. Please, man. I'm gonna count to five. Please! It's back there! I haven't eaten in two days! Four, three, two-- Anderson! Lower the weapon! Lower it! Get up! I'll do whatever you want. I'll join the province, become a soldier. Whatever you need. We need that bag! I threw it back there! You want to be a soldier? Stealing from our province isn't a good start. I was hungry! Where is that bag? Get up! Get up! Where is it? It's back there! Where? Where? Ain't no bag. Hello? Hello? Quiet. Quiet! Quiet! Harold? You got any of the pills? Harold, it's me-- Sean. Quiet. No, seriously. I've already looked out here, man. It's all clear. Everything's fine. It's me-- Sean. I haven't seen you since we crossed over what used to be Shreveport. I thought you were-- It's good to see you, man. Thank you. It's not in here, Harris. Maybe he ate it. It's not funny. He ate everything else. I mean, just-- just hear me out, all right? This is the first clue that she might actually still be alive, so... don't tell me that-- Look. I know you miss her, man, but all you got is a list of random names. And it's your mind that's making you think that that Kate Johnson is your Kate Johnson. That list is from Georgetown, not L.A. And-- And Kate Johnson? Do you know how many Kate Johnsons there are in the world? Even now? That could be anybody. And-- And out there, man, there are no trees, there's no shade, there's nowhere to hide from the P.O.'s. There's no life. That's why they call it the deadlands. Your wife, God bless her soul, is dead. She's not dead. And this fascination you have with finding her, still, is gonna get you the same result. She's still alive. I know it. And all I need is a little bit of hope to get me to her. This is that hope. If hope is what you're looking for, you're better off with that. No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! Surprise! Yeah! Whoo! What in the world's that? What does "uoy evol I" mean? It's backward, Sean. You'll see it when it comes back around. It says "I love you." I just messed up a perfectly romantic first time to tell you that I love you. Didn't I? Every girl gets to hear "I love you." How many girls get to hear "uoy evol I"? Turn around! I'm not looking for any trouble. Harris! Where are you? West of the stream! Code 21! Damn it! Okay-- Shut the hell up. - Seriously, just-- - Shut the fuck up. I swear to God, I'll cut your fuckin' throat. All right. Okay. You run like a son of a bitch. You know that? - What you got there? Hmm? - Nothin'. What the hell's this? Hmm? Crosswords? Word find? What's on this paper? Read it for yourself. Don't make me repeat it again. You can't read? I can read just fine, asshole. I just can't see well up close. You know, I haven't had time to go to the eyeglass store... in between my yoga classes and mani-pedis. Look. I'm telling you. I-- I don't know what it says, so just-- The only words... I hear out of this mouth... are the words on this paper. All right. Fine. It's "WWW 105.95"-- Look. I'm telling you, man. It's jumbled. I don't know what it says. Then why the hell you have it then? You stole it from the P.O.'s. Who the hell are you, huh? My name is Sean Kalos. I was from Los Angeles before it happened, and now I'm here. That's it. That's it. I take it you're from-- I'm from "fuck you." That's where I'm from. Tell you what. This ends up in barter-- you know, any worth whatsoever-- tools of trade-- anything-- we split it 50-50. Not looking for profit. All right. 70-30. You must have been a frickin' ace in the business world. We good? We're good. Good. I think I know someone who might tell us what that code means. Did you see it comin'? See what? The plague. No. Nobody did. The fallout caused the P-19 strain. P-19s my ass. Every living person is sick. So we call it like we see it. We're the lowest value of what's left. We're pennies. Yeah. Everyone's a penny. Nah. Not everybody. You heard about the steels, right? People say the plague's effect was reverse on steels, making them twice as strong... and giving them superpowers, like Superman. Superpowers, huh? How do you know I'm not a steel? Son of a bitch. You're a penny all right. So you've seen these steels? No, not personally. I heard, in the Northern Province, they have a bunch of pennies. One of 'em got trapped in a hundred-foot avalanche. Pulled his way out. And then he got shot in the heart by a bunch of P.O.'s. Walked away without a scratch on him. Yeah, right. So where are you taking me anyway? There's a guy named Shiv I want you to meet. Code breaker back in the war. But I warn you-- he's a little shell-shocked, if you know what I mean. He's a half-boiled egg. You know, he's two cans short-- I got it, I got it, I got it. I know a guy like that. Nate, is your light broke? Aw, geez. Have you been here all night? I told you you can come stay with me anytime, man. This is not healthy. Oh, Jesus, man. They are at it again. They are-- We are in deep shit, man. It is unbelievable, man. Nate, I don't think you should be-- Oh. Yeah. Ju-Just-- Just-- Just take a look at this, okay? Just take a look at it. Please. Okay? They're aimed now at North Korea. And, uh-- our government is lying to its people. And-And-And believe you me, we-- we are gonna be playing pin the tail on some really pissed-off donkeys. Nate, I told you, man. You can't believe everything you read on those blog sites. You know, they're full of-- no offense-- conspiracy theorists. Yeah, well, that's not the only thing they-- they say, and-- How much money do you make? - Oh-- - Okay, okay. Have you ever put your money into stock? - Man, I don't have enough money to-- - Okay. These sites can also mathematically determine... what are gonna be the highest-yielding stocks to buy... i-if the nation moves into the next stage of-of the war. Like, um, this company. VMI. They-They make, uh, warfare-- weapons and-and-and body armor. Uh, it's, um, uh, "Kelvar." You ever heard of that? Kevlar? Kevlar. Um, yeah. Um, uh, they, uh-- Think-Think that, only, uh, thinner. These guys say that it can, uh, dense up... when-when-- when a bullet hits it. It's frickin' amazing stuff, man. Okay? When they're done with these tests, this VMI stock is gonna be like-- like fishing with dynamite, you know. This is guaranteed money. A lock. You sure you know where you're going? Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. What's today? I don't know. I haven't known days in years. Florida dipped off in the ocean not too long ago. I don't know how many states that leaves, but... I got my money on 13. Thirteen provinces, huh? Don't you think that's a little ironic? Okay. You have any idea where the hell you're going? Shut up. Is this it? No. I don't know what this is. Be with you in one second. What are you guys in the mood for? '20s flapper? You want a cheerleader, schoolgirl? What? You guys new? You don't know the drill? No. We know the drill. Waiting for you to come out. You guys want some coffee? Yeah. Um, let's see. I'm not sure if I have enough. Um-- All right, assholes. What do you want? Coffee's good. We just came across this cabin. That's all. Got curious. Just looking for my wife. You said you're looking for your wife? All the way from Los Angeles. Every day for the past five years. Look. I'm sorry for the trouble. We'll just see ourselves out. Hold on. You don't have to go. I'm Zoona. I'm Sean. That's my husband. We took that in Vegas. The year before-- well, you know. Is he-- He was in Houston on business when the bombs hit there. He was the only decent guy I ever knew. That's Katie. She's beautiful. Yeah. So what are you doing out here anyway? I work for the province. I have been for the past two years. They put me out here for the officers who patrol the outskirts. They let me live here, safely, don't give me any trouble. Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me. First of all, if the P.O.'s found you out here, they'd lock you up, take this place over for themselves. And secondly, why the hell would they bring you out here in the middle of nowhere, all alone? I give them favors. So you cook? Not exactly. What do you do then? She gives them favors, Jax. You do remember favors, right? Oh. You'll have to excuse him. He lost his glasses. He, uh, obviously can't see how pretty you are. Want to do me a favor? You sure? You don't know what you're missing. So how do they trust you? The province. How do they know they can trust you? I've earned it. I've been loyal for a long time. They give me food, shelter, the penny pill. Out here it doesn't get much better than this. It's heaven compared to the camps. The camps? The province has these camps set up all over the greenland-- forced prostitution camps, strictly for the officers and soldiers. They have to keep the women in camps because, if not, they'll try to escape. These-- These camps-- are they all women? Yeah, but they have other camps for the men and women that don't make officer-- work camps. Everyone else they deem unfit for the province, they either kill or leave them out to die. What about the names of these camps? Can you remember any? Why? Oh, come on, Zoona. Just help me out. The names of the camps. Can you remember any of them? Um, there's Lincoln, Dooly, Athens, Georgetown. Georgetown? Yeah. Georgetown's a prostitution camp? Yeah. Were you there? Were you there? Did you ever go to Georgetown? Yeah. Did you see her? Did you see her there? Wait. Wait. Where did you get this paper? Is there a Kate Johnson? I called her Katie, but on the list, it's listed as "Kate." Where did you get this? Are you guys part of the underground? No! I just need to know, have you seen her? Oh, shit. Who's that outside? Look, give me one reason I shouldn't turn you guys in right now. I have to find my wife! Okay? So, shoot me, turn me in, do whatever you gotta do, but I have to know, have you seen her? Sean, I'm sorry. I haven't seen her. You smell like a-- Oh, man. You're sick, man. Look. You have to go. If they find you, they'll kill you. And then they'll kill me. Hey, baby. Hey, Zoona. Zoona, Zoona, Zoona. Hey, Clarence. Want some coffee? I didn't come here for no damn coffee. And I told you not to call me Clarence, didn't I? Yeah. Only my mama calls me Clarence, huh? I'm sorry. Yeah. I forgot. I forgot. Ow. Have to treat that fine little ass about... how to respect an authority figure. Huh? So, how was your day? Well, it could get a lot better. You look great. Thanks. Lot of boys out there waiting for you, but who's your man? You are. Huh? Who's your man? Well, why aren't you acting like that? Sorry. - What's wrong with you? Nothin'. Stand up. Mmm. Mmm. Ah! Oh! Fuck! Hey! Hey! Myers! Trucker! Trucker! Come on. Fuck! Shit. Come on. Get the fuck out of here! Go, go, go. Go, go, go! Fuck it. - Where are the camps? - Don't. Where are the camps? - Fuck you. I'm gonna kill you if you don't tell me where the camps are. They'll hear us on that thing. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Shockley, get over here. Geez, you look terrible. Why aren't you in line? I'm sorry, sir. I, uh-- I didn't know-- One hundred percent. Do I need to remind you again? One hundred percent of us are infected with the plague. The difference between us and them is that you get medication. They don't. If you do not take this pill at least once a week, you will get very sick again, and you will be of no use. Is that what you want, gentlemen-- to be of no use? No, sir. Good. Harris, what happened? We arrived from pickup, stopped to urinate, Anderson had his bag stolen by a P-19. Do you know what was inside that bag, Officer Anderson? Orders. Orders from the president. All the way from the Haven. Now, do you know what happens when orders go missing, Mr. Anderson? Someone else's eyes see them. As of this week, three more provinces have reported a strengthening of their power. In order for us to maintain our position... as a top importing camp for the Haven, we're gonna have to change some of our procedures around here. That is why it is vital... that you bring back those orders from the Haven. If another province gets their hands on those-- Sir, Officer Myers is here, says it's urgent. Sorry to barge in, Commander, but I thought you might want to see this. I found it in Area 7-Bravo. Did you see who was carrying the rest? No, sir, but she did. Want to know why I stayed alive so long? 'Cause I didn't do shit like this. Then why are you helping me? Let's get this straight. I don't give a shit about your wife. I look at you, and I see dollar signs. That's why I'm helping you. But at the end of the day, I gotta do what's best for me. Of course you do. How's that arm? It's fine. Just grazed me. Hurts like hell though. We're sitting ducks out here. Let's go find some cover. We do not need their support. This nation is the strongest nation on the face of the Earth. And being that, this nation has a responsibility... to the rest of the world to lead by example. Now, if that means we must shake the foundation-- So, what'd he do now? I don't know. Started his speech and got distracted by the glare. Just started saying, "Ooh, shiny thing." I'll bet. Which one? That one. ...and answered their call of duty... to join the fight for their country. Doesn't scare you at all, does it? I'm just saying he won with 87% of the vote. I mean, he is pretty much untouchable. And did you vote? - No. - The talks did not go as well as we had hoped. Come on. Like it would have even made a dent. He's a loose cannon now. You know that no other countries are backing us at all? Sean, you've gotta stop letting other people's opinions affect yours. Nathaniel's got your head all filled... with these conspiracy theories, when it should be focused on... me. Every reserve will be recalled to active duty, and all of our active military will move to a level orange status. You promise me it doesn't bother you-- me wanting to keep my last name when we get married? I'd love you if your last name was Jeeley-Squire. Good. I'm gonna go to work. Bring home the bacon. After all, if Nathaniel's right, we have a lot of tuna and bottled water to stock up on. Hold on. You deserve something bigger than this. Sean, it's perfect. Besides, it's not the size of the stone that matters to me. It's the size of-- of the heart. I started this war, and I'll finish it. I'm never gonna take it off. Welcome. Sean. This is Katie. Sean. Katie. Pleasure. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I love this house. I want this house. I know, Katie. It's perfect. I know. It's just-- It's twice as much as we can afford. I'll get a second job. I'll-- I'll work the streets at night. Come on. Can you imagine you and me, little Cole and little Sarah? Katie, I-- Don't do-- We'd have an amazing life here. We deserve this house. It'll be the best investment we'll ever make. All right. Well, promise me you won't hang a painting of your mom in this room. Sean! Hey, Nate. Nate, Nate. Hey, man. Is that site still predicting that stock to go up? And, uh-- What site would that be? - The one with the missiles and the body armor stuff. - VMI? VMI. Yeah. Oh. So you want in, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I-I want in. How much? They have medication. How many total? That's it. Just two. - How are we on the perimeter? - All clear. Okay. Go. It's hard staying away from people when the greenlands just keep getting smaller. If they're rebuilding the U.S., well, they're damn sure not doing it here. So, if we're friends, why don't you show me that paper? The orders from province you showed that whore. It's nothing. Fuck you. It's nothing. Fuck you. I just killed a fucking P.O. for you. So we're connected whether you like it or not. There's a list, all right? I think my wife may be on that list. After what Zoona said, I just-- I have to know if it might be her. I knew it. We're being followed. Just don't speed up. They'll know that we see 'em. You hear me, Jax? Jax? - Give us those pills, we'll let you and your friend go. - I'm not giving you anything. That's what we'd hoped you'd say. You're gonna blow our cover! What bag? Where's his bag? Don't touch his bag? Take the hood off. I got his bag right here. Good evening. I trust if we release you from the trap, you'll not contest. - What did you do with Jax? - Still breathing-- barely. Just give me the word, Red. I swear to God! Just give me the word! Do you know who we are? No. We are called The Voice. You're the underground? You're as bad as they are. Takin' prisoners, killing people. If we wanted to kill you, you would be dead. The province has given themselves the power over life and death. And those who the province divides... we unite. Get in there. What do you have to say for yourself, Zoona? You know you put this on yourself. Fuck you. There's nothing more I'd like to do than to do that right now. But my commander's setting up your sentence, and you ain't gonna be in here real long. Don't touch that one. She's got lice and some kind of fungus and no telling what other kind of shit. Personally, I think her pussy may move on its own. Thanks for your concern, Clarence. I told you not to call me Clarence! Personally I hope they don't kill you. I'm really gonna miss you bobbing up and down on my Lincoln Log. Bitch. What are you laughing at? Myers. I've never heard anyone talk to him like that... and live to talk about it. His name's Clarence? They say I'm stage three-- unworthy. Sorry. Were you in a camp? Yeah. Georgetown. You were at Georgetown? That's still a prostitution camp, right? That's what everyone thinks. It used to be, but not anymore. Come on. Let's move! Get in here! Get in here! Oh! Look at what we got in here! Move, move! Now, it's more like a holding area than a camp. Go! Come on! Let's move! Divide them up. Come on! Get over there! Get over there! Get over there! Hey! No! No! No! No! It's horrible. But they keep us healthy. Most of us anyway. You know what, this is gonna sound crazy, but when you were in the camp, did you ever hear of a girl named Kate Johnson? I knew a Kate, but I don't know if it was her. She was code 99. The very rare blood types. The province scientists believe that by using our blood type... they can create a vaccine to wipe away the P-19 virus altogether. Once they create that antidote, they'll give birth to pure code 99s... and ensure a healthy society at the Haven. They make the medications there. They're going to build the entire United Province. That's where we need to be-- in the Haven. So you were following us? You have something we need. You got a hell of a way of asking. You were in a hot zone. Would you have rather us left you swimming out there in a sea of P.O.'s? What exactly do you need? We need your medication. Now, why should I believe you need it any more than we do? We got people here with advanced conditions of the plague. You and your friend-- I mean, you're still at stage one. These people are at stage three. They might die tomorrow without medication. You'll let Jax go? All right. All right. Thank you. We would have let him go anyway. You see, no matter where we came from, we're all the same here. I mean, Pollack-- Pollack was a dentist. Tereshinski was a schoolteacher. Krannen-- Krannen was a thief. And you? I was a grandfather. Red, these men-- they follow you, they believe in you. Yeah. Why don't you fight back now? Uh, the enemy countries who survived the bomb-- their soldiers are coming here to claim this land as their own... after the plague has passed. We have to be a united front on that day. But for now, the Vision grow stronger. And we'll know when it's time to rise when he comes. Who's "he"? The Great Steel. He's making his way to us. Look, he defeated an entire officer camp in the Orleans Province. I mean, drops of his blood healed a sick bay of 500 pennies... in the northern deadlands. I mean, he's unstoppable, and with us fighting by his side, we can take back what is ours. Man, these stories, they're just... stories. You're the leader of these men. The Steel? Just a myth. A myth? A myth! The Steel is coming, and when he does, we'll never have to spend another night hiding in the shadows. Let's go. Son of a fuckin' whore. If they're so fuckin' great, why don't you fuckin' ask 'em for help? I told you, they have their fight, and I have mine. Shit. - Shit! - Fucking shit! - Wh-What did it feel like? - Like a-- Like a click. Like a fucking click. - That's what it sounded like! What'd it feel like? - I don't know. Is it a mine? I don't know yet. Okay. Uh-- Just duck down, take a look. Duck down? Duck down, take a look! Describe a few things. Tell me what you see. And wipe off the dirt. Slowly! All right, all right. Now, is it green? Yeah. Yeah, it's green. Okay. Is there, uh, ridges near the front end? - Which one's the front? - Are there ridges anywhere near it? - Yeah, yeah. There's three of 'em. - Fuck! Okay. It's homemade. Okay, um-- Uh-- Is there a small bump, maybe the size of a ballpoint pen, in the middle? - Where is it? - In the middle! My foot's on the thing! I can't see anything! There's something out there in the bush. You're now convicted of trespassing! The penalty is death by firing squad! Men, aim your weapons! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shiv, Shiv, Shiv. Shiv. We-We just got lost. We're not trespassing. You, on the mine! Pick it up! - Pick it up? - I said, pick it up! All right, all right. I got an idea. If you can keep it engaged, it won't blow. Just don't take your finger off. Okay. I'm gonna pick it up. It's a fucking dud. You are one crazy son of a bitch! I like that! Is that Shiv? Hey, Shiv! We got something you might want to see. Okay, but just the other one. Me and Jimmy don't trust you no more, Jax. Oops! I almost forgot. Drop 'em, boys! You're Harris, right? I'm Shockley. David Shockley. I just came in to duty. You're something of a legend around here. You were in the military before it happened. I grew up on a cattle ranch. We used to have these wild hogs on our land. They were a nuisance really. Once a year we'd round them up. My dad would shoot 'em. I never could. He'd say, "After you get used to hearing the screams, you just get kind of numb to it." Is he right? I mean, you have more confirmed kills than the commander. Do you still hear the screams? Do you still hear 'em? Yeah. Good. It's when you don't that you need to start being scared. Talk to me for a second. Now, I'm not mad at you, Zoona. You've done a lot of good things for this province. But right now, we really need your help. You need to tell us where they are, what they want. If you tell us that, he's gonna let you live. No, he won't. Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me, aren't you? Just tell us everything, Zoona. It's your choice. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Open your mouth. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Jax. Jax should know better than to show up here again. Dirty scoundrel. Screwed me sideways. Spun me around like a top. "Top of the hill! That's where I belong! Top of the hill!" We don't trust that guy. We don't trust him for one second. He's probably sitting right outside that tent, waiting for us to set foot out there, but that's not gonna happen 'cause we know him better than that. Yes, sir. We know him better than that. I'm gonna take him, I'm gonna cut his nut sack open in a circle... like a tin can of boiled peanuts. Shiv. The only reason I'm here-- I just-- I just need some help with something. I think it's some sort of code. Yeah. Huh. Now, Jax, he told me what you used to do. Huh? What'd he say? What'd he say I did? Huh? The part about code breaking, about you being a code breaker. Oh. Geez, I'm sorry. I scared you, didn't I? So, how much? How much what? The cost, to barter. What's in it for me? See, Jimmy and I-- We don't know you from Adam. I knew a guy named Adam once, and he was a prick. So, you want my help, then you gotta give me something. How 'bout your hands? What? Your hands-- Cut 'em off, give 'em to me, then I'll break your code. No, no, Shiv. Look, I don't have anything of value at all. But I'll give you everything I have, everything on me... if you can help me find her, if she's-- What? I like you. I like you. I'll just take a finger. No, no. Shiv. Hey. Don't be so nervous. He's a nervous son of a bitch, isn't he, Jimmy? What you got? Let me see this there. Ah. You know what this is? Yeah, I have an idea. Uh-huh. See? See this little mark right there? This comes from el presidente hisself. Them's "offi-shee" orders. See, now somebody's ass is grass. Different from what I'm used to, but I'll give it a crack. Yes, sirree, Bob. I'll give it a crack. ? A crack, la-la I'll give it a crack ? ? A crack, a crack, a crack ? It's probably a-- probably the old book code here. You know what books are, don't you, Einstein? Huh? Huh? Okay. They pick a book, they send in a breaker, they pick the same book. To break a code, you need a key. Now, a key is usually a series of numbers... divided with a period, or a letter, or whatever. Numbers are line numbers on the page, then a word number on that line. But the trick is-- the trick is finding the right damn book... 'cause it's gotta be the same exact edition, same publisher, same everything. Even one little period out of place-- phh-- throws the whole damn thing off. I tell you what, Sherlock. I've looked at everything from James Joyce to Playboy, and I can't find a single word in any one of 'em. So whatever this, uh, code is, I can't find a damn key... if there's no lock to open it from. Wait a minute. We got something here. Um-- You know, this is just the same thing... all over again. Don't talk! This is how we got here in the first place. Trusting blindly. Turning our heads away from the truth. I was chosen, okay? What was I supposed to do? I left a family back there. Do you know what? The way I see it, I'm lucky... 'cause I can have a future now, a new beginning. I can have a purpose again. I'm not just sitting, waiting to die. You can't change what happened, but you can change the way we get it back. Now, whoever wrote this code didn't want it getting out. See, this is old military code. I haven't seen it since the great war. But, uh-- Shh. Now, see, now, "fly" means exactly what's implied. Means moving out or transporting. And, uh, "shifter"-- That's a military term meaning guarded area. So that's what that means. And, uh-- What? Oh. You know what? You might be onto something. I think that-- Shiv! Shh! Don't interrupt! God! I'll tell him. No, "haven" means, uh, a place of refuge. Now, uh, that would be transporting something to a haven, a new capital... or, uh, a wonderful land of O-- Ah! You're off to see the Wizard. Shiv, the Haven. Now, where is it? How do we get there? How do we get there? How do we get there? Oh, my God. How do we get there? We follow the yellow brick road. We take the highway. You drop me off at the Waffle Palace. I get a quickie with Margie in the back kitchen. How do we get there? How do we get there? Shiv, please, just-- Okay. Get there. Now, uh, "flick." Now, that's got me second-guessing. Uh-- That either means, uh, it's an obscene gesture... or it means cure, or recipe, or medicine. What? Oh, I think you're right. Antidote. Mr. M.I.T. over here. So what does it all mean? Well, um, I'm only half a genius, but I'll tell you what I think it means. "Rufler" is, uh-- whatever "rhine" is-- uh, transporting something from the southernmost tip to the Haven... to create an antidote for the pennies. Are we saying there's a cure for the plague? Well, how am I supposed to know? I still have two words I haven't even figured out yet. The something. "Cane" and "rhine." What? The something, the transport-- Could it be someone instead of something? I was told this Georgetown is a camp. Could this list be the transport? I always thought that the antidote was like a myth... to keep the underground quiet, keep 'em from rebelling. But if it's true you found an antidote, then I think Jimmy and I deserve first-- Just forget the antidote, okay? There's a name on this list. All I care about is finding that name. You've gotta tell me the connection between the two. Uh, "cane" means a prisoner, female prisoner. Transporting the female prisoners then. What does "rhine" mean? "Rhine" means I don't give a flying nun. You have an antidote for the apocalypse, and all you care about-- Listen to me! I don't care about saving the world. I care about saving my wife. Lunatic. Got a cape? What? Got yourself a cape? No, I don't have a cape. Ah. Well, then you'd better find yourself a phone booth pretty damn quick, Mr. Clark Dense, because whatever Rufler's province is losing here in transport... must be pretty damn valuable. And I'll tell you something. We'd better hope that the Haven is a cartoon land, super moron, because in the world we live in, P.O.'s are the only one with the speeding bullets. And if your wife is indeed a prisoner, and she's part of this transport, and the orders haven't been carried out yet, you're gonna have a hell of a time getting past the front gate. Hell of a time. Psst. What'd the code say? It said go straight, southwest corner. That's where we'll find her. Find who? Find who? Don't fuck with me, Jax. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know? Shh! I have to believe it's her. All right. And if there's even a chance that it's her, nothing, especially you, is gonna stop me. So get the fuck out of my way. All right, all right. Think about it. No, it's pitch black out here. Jax. Get out of my way. It's pitch black out here. You won't know which way is which. Just listen, listen, listen, listen. I found a close place to stay. I say we get some rest, head out in the morning. All right. Sure. Come on, come on. Pick up. Come on. Pick up, man. Pick up. Come on-- Hey. Hey, hey, Sean. Hey, listen, listen close, okay? The suit failed the tests. The, um-- The military has canceled its contract. VMI stock has bottomed out, man. It's-- It's not worth a penny, man. Uh, please, please tell me that you cashed out last week. Sean? Come on, Sean. Sean? He said it was a sure thing. You know, I just-- He said it was a sure thing. Explain it to me, Sean. I'm trying to understand, but I need you to explain it to me. Look, I'm trying to. I just-- Look, I know I messed up. I just-- Whatever decision I make here, I mean, you've gotta back me up. I mean, that's your job. My job? Come on. You know I didn't mean job. So that's my job, huh? Come on. Let me tell you about some of the qualifications for my job. I love you. We're in this together. I don't recall ever reading anything on the job application about sitting idly by... while you go out and make rash decisions that affect both of our lives... because-- because you got some stock tip... from one of Nathaniel's crazy conspiracy Web sites. Didn't that seem like kind of an unreliable source to you? He's family. Jesus, Sean! Your sister divorced him five years ago... because crazy people do crazy things. He's not crazy! He's-- You're not even listening to me, Katie. You're just-- You don't understand. You just-- You don't understand. Then make me understand, Sean. Please, make me understand. You wanted the house. You wanted the house too. Don't you lay that all on me! I'm not laying anything on you. Look, Katie-- I thought I could make it better. You know, our life? I thought I could make it better with this one thing, and-- That's where you're wrong, Sean. You don't get to make it better. We make it better. That's what makes me so mad about this whole thing. It's that you didn't even run it by me. You didn't ask my opinion. Nothing. You just did it. I know. I-- I should have asked. How much did we lose? Sean? How much did we lose? I lost it all. All of it. Okay. Okay. We've-- We've got my savings. No. No, we don't, Katie. I put that in there too. I mean, it's gone. Sean, how-- How could you-- How could you-- I-- I need to go. I-- I need to go. I need to go see my sister in Atlanta. Hey, come here. No, Sean. Why? Why couldn't you just tell me? I don't care if we live in a mansion or in a cardboard box... so long as I know that I can trust you. And I don't know that I can do that right now. I don't know that I can do that ever again. Go, go, go! Alive! Alive! Shockley! He said alive! He said alive! Get down, down, down, down! Anderson! Gentlemen, gentlemen. You've caused quite a stir over the last 48 hours, but, uh, nevertheless, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. You know, I guess I have a soft spot for anyone who's got courage enough... to stand up to such a powerful force as my province officers. Sean. Your face. I saw it. It was torn up by the thorns, but... there's no cuts, no scars. Only steels have the power to do that. You're a steel, Sean. You're a steel. Get him, Shockley! You were right, Mr. Jax. This man is no steel. The myth remains a myth. Our men will escort you to the Haven... where your request will be granted. Their deal was better than yours. Gotta do what's best for me. We waited till morning because a man with your... resilience... had some of the men thinking that maybe you were a steel. But at the end of it all, you're just a P-19, a worthless penny. Bring her out. You know, I would introduce you, but, uh, I think you two have met. Katie Johnson. Honey. Honey. Don't be shy. Say hello. Hey. Hey, hey. Harris. Easy. There's no honor in this, sir. This is not our fight. It's not about fights! It's about following orders! Obey orders when I give them! No! This is not our fight. No! No, no, no! Don't! No! Found out what "rhine" means. Sacrifice. Hello? Is there anybody here? Is there anybody here? You should eat. Look, I know you have no reason to listen to me... after what you've been through. I just want you to know that... I wish I believed in something... that strongly. Was that the only Kate Johnson? You're next in line to succeed me when the time comes. The way I see it, you gotta make a choice. Now, either you're going to continue to question my command, or you're gonna follow my lead, and one day you'll be running one of the United Provinces. I'll see to it. Thank you, sir. Now, for tomorrow morning, orders have changed. Some officials from the Northern Province are coming to take a trade. I don't understand, sir. The orders specifically said that the women needed to be delivered to the Haven. For the nation to survive, we need to be leading it. We need oil. We need more medication. They need women. But you told us that the women were to ensure the future of the nation, not just the province. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the future of the province. Now, when the Haven officers come... and question why the mission was not completed, you will tell them the women escaped. Round up the 99s. They leave in the morning. Traitors. Worst kind of people. But they always get their due. Right, Harris? They always get their due. What are you doing here? Now you got nothing to say? Shit. I'm sorry, Zoona. You better get out of here. If they catch you here-- What is this? Rise and shine, cocksucker. Any special requests for your last meal? No? That's fine. I'll eat it. You better not be dead. You're not dead until I say you're dead. And I hope you put up a better fight than your wife did. Listen up, ladies! To your feet. We are leaving. You're heading out this way. One line! Keep that line tight! Yes, sir. There's one gate to open. The other province will be here soon. Grab a uniform. I'll buy you some time before you get out there. But stay in here until it's done. You'll know when to come out. Gentlemen, good work. All of them brought up to this gate? Yes, sir. They're ready to move out. The commander wants to debrief everyone at the officers' camp before we deploy. Yes, sir. Just do it. I've got the gate. All right. This is as far as I can take you. The officers were ordered to load you up, so you're just gonna have to outrun 'em. Godspeed. Let's go-- Oh, my God. They said there wasn't a Katie Johnson. I thought you were-- I thought-- Thought I lost you, I took your last name. I took your last name. There he is. Myers! Take a team, go get the rest. Oh, shit. Just who do you think you are anyway? That's what I thought. Shoot him. Shoot him in front of her. Do it! Do it now! No! No! Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean. God! No! No! No. Who do I think I am? Let her go. Fire again! No! Fire! No, we can't! Raise your weapons, you idiots! We can't. We can't. Don't you see? Don't you understand? All right. You won't do it, I will. You're a steel, but she's not. Thanks. Red's leading his men to the Haven. The more I think about it, there is a rebirth going on. We should be there to see it. You should come with us. Wish I could, but... after today, I think I'm gonna have my hands full for a while. Good luck.
