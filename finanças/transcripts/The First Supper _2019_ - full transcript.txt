Why are we eating here? What other choice do we have? Sure, but... the noodles are all soggy. Because you came late. Because you contacted me late! There you go, sounding like a city folk. Don't be a pain. Get with the times. This really sucks. It's food for invalids. By the way you heard about the bowling alley closing? Huh? The one by the bypass? Yeah. Sakae Plaza Bowling. No way. No more entertainment around here. There's plenty. Pachinko parlours. Listen. We consider it entertainment here but that's gambling elsewhere. You and all your opinions. Hey. I'm closing up here. Got change, Sis? Yeah, Mum gave me money. So she's "Mum" to you when she gives you money? What's the big deal? Thanks for the food. I bet you cook better than she does. Did I ever cook you ramen? Beats me. The First Supper The First Supper My old man died. Just before turning 65 at the dawn of the summer solstice. Dad... was great at bowling. He was. Here is your drink order. Please come through. Found it! Hello. Thank you for coming. Wake and funeral for the late Azuma Hitoshi Mr Mioka, that's not fair. You said the client liked it. The client wants to try other photographers too. There's nothing I could do. But, that's not what you... —Daisuke. —Listen, Rintaro. It's an advertising poster, not an art piece. You've been freelancing for two years. You should know better by now. E-Even so... Hey, Daisuke? What'd you do? Anyway, I should hear back from them today. OK? —What's wrong? —Wait... Yoshio, you look even older. What? No, I don't! People still think I'm in my thirties. Get out of here! Anyway, Miyako, you two OK? Yeah, we're OK. He's such a nag, I threatened to divorce him. That was mean! Well, he's such a chatterbox. Like a woman at the marketplace. You best not say that to him. Hey Rintaro, slacking off? Is your job going well? More or less. It's an unstable line of work. Can't be chasing a dream all your life. Miyako's just as bad. You two getting on? Kind of. At any rate I know your family is not like ordinary families but you've got to live right. Rintaro, get over here. Show Yoshio how to take photos. Hey... have you been drinking, Sis? Just a little. Yoshio made me. No, you're the one making me drink. The storm is fluctuating in intensity but will gradually worsen. No... I'll pour. Here. Where did Akiko go? Beats me. Probably busy somewhere. Why? She should join us. Hey, honey. You've had too much. The wake hasn't even started! It's only beer. You got told off. Jealous? As if! Hey. What? Isn't Shun coming? Don't ask me. Why would he come? He'd be an outsider here. An outsider? Why'd you do it, Dad? Hey. Hey. What? Aunt just told me something. That woman has been in the kitchen all day, remember? —Has she? —Yeah. So... Aunt saw. Saw what? —What? —Over there. Who is that? An old classmate. So... she saw that woman in the kitchen staring at something. A fancy envelope, like from a TV show. Covered in beautiful handwriting. —Huh? —Don't "huh" me. It must be Dad's will. Oh, the will? Stupid. What will? Shut up, honey. —But I... —Be quiet. Hey, Miyako. What can I say... Please accept my condolences for your loss. Why'd you turn up here? Well... I thought you might be having a tough time. Of course I'm having a tough time. Come on, what's gotten into you? Well, it's just... —The other day... —The class reunion? We were drunk, that's all. You know, you shouldn't take it seriously. What does that mean? Oh, Mr Sugiyama! Thanks for taking the time to be here. Oh, Miyako? Look at you, all grown up! I'm sure your dad's proud of you. —My husband and kids. —I see. Hello, I'm Sugiyama. I'm a barber a ways away. —Miki, Daisuke, say hello. —Say hello. —Yes, Daisuke. —Hello. —Miki? —Yes. —What a cutie. Hello. —Hello. How's the wake? Fine. We just finished. I see. You must be tired. Hey... Is there anything I can do to help? No, it's fine. My aunts are fussing over everything so it wouldn't be easy to join in. You'd just feel awkward here, Rie. Would I? Miki! Daisuke! Knock it off already. By the way, my sister's kids are here and they've grown up a lot. They broke an urn and bawled their eyes out. They're a real handful. I guess that's how kids are. You all right? Come on... This is tougher on me, you know. I'm sorry. Oh, I was just joking. I envy you, Rintaro. How come? You can make jokes at a time like this. Oh man, that was the crappiest chanting I ever heard! Honey! Hey you. Know what a wake's for? What do you mean, it's cancelled? That's ridiculous. We can't cook for everybody on the day of the wake. You're in a bind? We're the ones in a bind here! Whatever. We need food, so make some now. Three hours? Think we can wait that long? Listen here... Did you know? Come on, how would I know? What's going on? What's wrong, you two? The food. Well, Miyako called up and they said the order was cancelled. That caterer wasn't making any sense. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. I told them we didn't need food. Why? But everybody's waiting. The rice is nearly ready. —What rice? —Tonight, I'm cooking. So, don't worry. What the hell? Tell everyone to wait a little longer. So, Miyako what swanky food is Akiko cooking? No idea. She isn't from around here. I can't figure her out. Now now, Morikazu. It won't be hick food. Probably a Tokyo-style feast. You know what that is? No, I'm a hick too. —Could you help me? —Sure. Thank you for waiting. Here you go. Here. Akiko, this is... What is this exactly? My husband's last wish. It's not much, but please tuck in. Well, to be honest fried eggs are a little too... They're fine. It was what Hitoshi wanted. Come on, eat. I know you're hungry. —Thank you. —Thank you for the food. —Tuck in. —But this is too... Looks yummy. It's good. What? Something wrong? No... I think fried egg was the first food Dad ever cooked for us. Oh yeah? It came back to me. An old memory. From back when I was seven. It was the first time all five of us came together. An hour later we were at the hospital. Why didn't you say anything? Sorry. It didn't hurt at all. Your test results show you have acute appendicitis. It's your appendix. We'll operate tomorrow and keep you here for a week. Take good care of her. Come in, kids. You must be worried about your mum. Dad, are you really going to cook? Yeah. Let's just eat out. I told you I'll cook. —Ham. —Ham, ham. —Ham? —Yeah. —Ham. —Ham's in... the bottom drawer. The middle one. This will do. What's that? Dad, that's not ham. It'll be fine. Don't sweat the small stuff. Be tasty! Be tasty! —Be tasty. —Shut up. Be tasty... —Rintaro, plates. —Plates? Plates... get me the plates. Over there. How is it? Great. Yummy. You know, it was surprisingly good. But saying so turned out to be a big mistake. Till Mum left hospital he made it for every meal. You sure have a good memory. Huh? You said it was yummy too. I did not. Even so I honestly don't understand... why Dad tried to start a new family. Hi, kids. Hi. Hi. Shun. He must've known... it was all going to fall apart one day. That's a lot of ingredients. The soup's heavenly. Want some carrot? —It's delicious. —Is it yummy? The first fight we had after we started living together was over miso soup. —Thanks for the food. —Thank you. Thank you. What's this? It's cloudy. No, it isn't. It's red miso. It is cloudy. Our soup is usually white. That's white miso soup. It's all soup and no ingredients. Miyako, you prefer white miso? I like my mum's miso soup. Then don't drink it. Hey... Miyako! The next day it was Shun who acted like a baby. What's up, Shun? Nothing. Just not hungry. Then, one morning as Miyako and Shun's boycott continued... Tuck in. What's this? Blended miso. Huh? But... Starting today this is the only miso soup I'll make. Have it, or don't. It's up to you. —Thank you for the food. —Thank you. I'm so full. Thank you for the food. It's delicious. Hitomi should learn from her. My brother's so simple I can read him like a book. In truth, I was angry over something else. Then don't drink it. What? Hey, Miyako! What's his problem? He thinks he's so cool. I'm going off. Take care. Why are they even here? Rock paper scissors! No running! Good morning. I knew nothing would change. Children can't change anything. Tuck in. That's why... I drank the soup. Thank you. Rintaro, want some sake? —Got an ashtray? —An ashtray? Got a lighter too? —Give the priest some. —Right... Slam it down. Your dad could really drink. There you go. Dad was a mountaineer. He did all kinds of side jobs including mountain guiding and climbed Japan's tallest peaks like Mount Tanigawa and Mount Tsurugi. —See you. —Take care. But when the two families merged he swiftly gave up mountaineering and returned home to work at a local factory. Despite having lived together for months Shun barely talked to me. Hi. Hi. What are you reading? What's that you're reading? Sawaki Kotaro. Sawaki Kotaro... Hey, you hungry? Well? What are those? Sweet potatoes. Did you live near mountains? Near the sea. I've been to the sea. With everybody, on a holiday. What about you? What does your dad do? Does he have holidays? I wish I knew. Hey, Shun. It's gone out. —You're right. —Will it relight? Yeah, put that in. And stuff that'll burn. You can put more in. Just dump lots in. Dump it all in? OK. Dump lots in. —This too? —No! Wait a minute... Oh man! Your neck. Your pants! All dirty? You're all sooty too! —Me too? —Look. Oh man. That night Dad came home and gave us a lecture. Here, it's ready. Look! They look delicious. —Thank you. —Thank you. Tuck in. I think it was around that time... I started calling Shun my big brother. You're all sooty. So are you, Big Bro. I am? Whoa, this tastes great. It does? It does! When is it? Tomorrow. Why didn't you tell me earlier? No reason. Not really. I can't go. I'm on the early shift. Until evening. I can't ask for a day off at the last minute. You don't have to. You should've told me earlier. Ouch. What's wrong? A bone. The other day too. I hate fish. You've still got to eat it or your bones will get weak. Eat it all you like. Don't force me to. Miyako. Your school's open day. Mind if I go? Do you? Would I... embarrass you? No, not really. Now, does everyone remember the division I taught you last week? You do? I gave you homework. OK, we'll all solve this later so do your best. Before that, let's revise. As you can see, when you divide 1.8 by 2.4... Our next stop is Sakae Plaza Bowling. Sakae Plaza Bowling. Miyako... Do you hate fish? I hate it. Because of all the bones? They stick in my mouth. Me too. It used to happen to me all the time. Every time I ate fish I'd get fish bones stuck in my throat. Over here. Used to, so not anymore? Miyako, would you like to know a secret? What? A spell, to keep bones away forever. No way. It sounds fake, but it works. What is it? Well... Atomiyosowaka. Say it three times. Atomiyo... Sowaka. Atomiyosowaka. That's right. That's it. Three times. Atomiyosowaka. Atomiyosowaka. It really works. Give it a try. What fish would you like? I don't know what they're called. —I really don't. —Let's choose together. What? Another bone? Why? Hey. Did you just say something? Yeah, she did. Years later, I found out where the bones went. It was after I got married and left home. Ouch. What? A bone? Well... Yeah. The first one in a long time. A long time? Fish always have bones. Yeah, but for a long while... She didn't have to... What a mess. I can't get at them. Azuma Residence Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me. I'm Izumi. Hitoshi's factory workmate. Please, come in. Now then, please take a look. Oh, OK. I'm late as usual. Oh, Mr Izumi. Akiko. Thank you for coming. Sorry, I'm late. Rintaro? It's been a while. You're all grown up. If you don't mind, please have some. —Here, help yourself. —Please... Gladly. Please, no need to kneel. Thank you. Thank you. Have some. Good man. Hitoshi was a workmate of mine at the factory. —He was very good to me. —Oh really. That Hitoshi... He was crazy about mountaineering which I couldn't figure out but he gave it up and got a real job. We were all relieved. Are you a climber too? No, not at all. That's a relief. That reminds me. Hitoshi suddenly started climbing again. When was that? Recently, right? —Honey... —But he did. A few years ago... remember? He got lost on a climb. He went missing. That's news to me. Oh? You didn't know? Well, it was no big deal really. What was he thinking causing trouble like that... Now now, Miyako. Don't say that. But... I think Dad first took us climbing in early spring. How much farther? —About four hours. —Don't lie! How much? We're nearly there. This looks tasty. Sure does. Here goes. Rintaro, stay still. Miyako, get in there. No way. Here we go. Come on... Ten seconds. Look, five, four, three, two... smile. OK! We got the shot. Shun, want to try climbing up there? Mum, look. Rintaro, can you? Feels good, right? Take a break? Listen... I'm sorry, Shun. From then on Dad and Shun often climbed together. Sometimes all five of us did but it was mostly just them. Azuma Residence This is a carabiner. A carabiner. Use your thumb like this. Wow. Lonesome Mountain Nice hotpot, wasn't it? It warmed us up. What about these? Just stack them up. Keep it down! —Chill, dude. —Hey! Amazing. Awesome. Done. May I tuck in? Here goes. Well? Crazy good, huh? For five years... we lived together. OK... let's eat... —I'm tucking in. —I'm tucking in. Pizza and sake don't mix. Come to think of it your dog doesn't even whimper. Old age does that. Oh right. So much for being a guard dog though. Nothing worth stealing here anyway. But, from now on Akiko will be all alone. You'd better visit her more. Well, I guess it's complicated. Coming home's hard, right? No, not really. Miyako, could you help? Are they getting along? Well, I wouldn't know. Yes and no, probably. What the heck does that mean? I worry about you guys, you know. After the way people here reacted when she married Hitoshi... This is no big deal. It's no big deal in Tokyo. Not unusual in the slightest. Is Kosuke OK with the food? He's fine. He'll eat anything. Really? Never mind that. Did Dad's will really mention food? Maybe. Wear this. What? I need help. I don't know how to make it. Now then, canned tuna and... What else goes in it? Hello? Yes. Yes, it is. We can do it. The first pitch. He throws! —A clean hit! —Go! Yes. Yes. —Yes! A home run! Awesome! —All right! Now we're tied. Amazing, huh? —Amazing, right? —Amazing! Akiko? What's wrong? Akiko! What's wrong? He died. On that day. The man... who used to be my husband. You mean... Shun's father. How? He was bedridden. It was inevitable. He was sick? After that phone call you and Dad stayed in the other room. Take care. I was so scared. I don't know why but I felt like I was with strangers. I couldn't help it. You idiot! I'm your elder! Watch your mouth! Shut up. Think you're so superior? You little brat! Butt out of our business! This morning you said you gave Mum the funeral home's number before Dad died. Of course I did. Somebody dies, you call a funeral home! Are you brain-damaged? Think of how we feel. Give me a break. You hardly visited him at the hospital. Now you play the good son? "Think of how we feel"? You got some nerve! Tell me. How many times did you visit him? I had to work. You had to work? You had a family! Cut it out! This isn't the place! It's your dad's wake! Calm down... Hello? Rintaro? How's the wake? It can't be easy for you. So, what about the competition? Oh, the competition. Yeah. No good? Well, you had a good run. Some said you should win. But, at the very end... Anyway, it's a tough time so leave it to me and take it easy. Mr Mioka. Yeah, what? What's wrong... with my photos? Hey, don't get me wrong... I want to know. Fair enough. I'll be blunt. Please. Your photos are cold. Cold? Yeah. No affection for the subject. You can sense it. But that's a style in itself. Not necessarily a bad thing. Well, I've got a meeting soon. OK. Things didn't go your way. Sorry. Incoming call: Azuma Rintaro It rolled all the way in there? Hey, no! Don't! Oh, man. You'll expose it. Expose it? Burn out the film. It's sensitive to light. What's wrong? Dad, did you fight with Mum? Why? I didn't. She was crying. She'll be back soon. No need to worry. OK? I can't remember much about what went through my mind back then. Or even what I ate. Still, now I feel as if we were all moving in the same direction. Speed? Up? They want you to speed up. No way! —Go for it, Miyako! —Go! Do your thing! Way to go! Good one! What are you studying? Political economy. Hey... Thanks for cooking and stuff. Why thank me? Because... Mum should be doing it. It's no big deal. It's normal. I suppose so. "I suppose so." You said "suppose". So? What's for dinner? For today... omelette rice, I suppose. I suppose so. Cut it out! A week later... Mum came home. I'm home. Hey, teach me soccer next. I'm not very good at it. Yeah? Then, teach me mountain climbing. OK, when you get a little older. How old do I have to be? Hey, Dad. How old does he have to be? Rintaro wants to go climbing. You'd better teach me. OK. I'll teach you everything. —Promise me. —I promise. Have a good time! Don't get injured! —Yeah! See you. —See you. Shun smiled and waved back. A bigger wave than ever before. But for some reason Dad never looked back at me. Hey, don't blame Dad. It's true. Where is he? Oh, he's busy. Mushroom pizza again? Yeah, as usual. Don't you get sick of it? Don't stay up all night. OK, OK. Good night. Good night. Miyako said, "Don't stay up." Looks good. It's hot! I'm tucking in. Dad, aren't you eating? Later. Hey, Shun. We... need to talk. The two of them came back after lunchtime the next day. Where's Shun? Its central pressure is 994 hectopascals with a top wind speed of 35m/s. Strong winds over 15m/s hit Fukuoka tomorrow... Eat. ...with the typhoon closest at night. Rain will be heaviest in the north... That night Shun stayed in his room, and never came out. A towel... Rintaro, you OK? Miyako! Grab a towel! Hurry! Dad! Get help! Mum! Shun! Hurry... hurry! Dear... dear! For you. I made ramen. It looks great! That one's mine. Hey! Don't be greedy. I'm tucking in. That reminds me. It's tomorrow. Your birthday. Hey, Dad. Can we eat out again? Dad? What? Mum, this is weird. What's going on? I'm... leaving. Tomorrow. All right. What? What are you saying? But, tomorrow's... your birthday. Rintaro's is next month. Where will you go? Hey. Where will you go? Hey, Shun! Miyako... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Liar. You promised me... you'd teach me climbing. You promised me. You're a liar, Shun. The next morning Shun was nowhere to be found. We never heard from him again. And we never saw him again. Not once. Please leave a message. Rie? It's me. That competition... I missed out again. They set the bar high. About meeting your parents... I just... I don't know what I should do. It's not that I don't want to. I just don't know what to do. Families are a mystery to me. My own family's a mystery. I can't figure them out. I don't understand my dad and I never tried to before. So, I gave it some thought but... Sorry, this is weird of me. Sorry. I'll be back tomorrow. I'll let you know when my flight is. What's up with you? Mum's cooking something. Let's go back in. Before... What were you talking about? Before? Nothing. Old times. Not that. With your old classmate. Just old times back in high school. Don't get the wrong idea. Why the scary look? What do you... want to do? Kosuke, listen... Sorry, sorry! Why are you all in here? What's up? Well, I was looking for the crapper, but... It's that way. That way. Come on, on your feet. On your feet. I can't handle my liquor anymore. I used to be able to drink gallons... Shun? Yo. Be good. A little boy's here. A little fellow. Hello, Naoto. Come on. Come to your grandma. Need help with your shoes? Hello. Thanks. Everyone, please go right ahead. OK, let's eat. Miyako. Rintaro. Shall we eat in there? You come too, Naoto. This stuff... makes sukiyaki even better. Introduce yourself. I'm Azuma Naoto. —How old? —I'm five. My son. I don't see him much though. What do you do now? Climbing. Mostly overseas. Joining climbing expeditions. Next year is Everest. I've explained to the relatives. Because you didn't. They didn't need to know. It's in the will. This was the last meal your father ate. But... Not at the hospital. Here. I'm home. This desk. That stain on the ceiling. All of this takes me back. It brings back memories? You bet. Miyako's married now, isn't she? She's actually a mother now. A mother of two. Surprised? —Our Miyako? —Our Miyako. Your granddad's there too. Dear, Shun brought his son to see you. Can you sit up? Wait right there. Naoto and Taro get on well now. Shun... Next time... where will you climb? I told you. The Matterhorn. The north face. A great mountain. I'm... I'm hungry. I feel like... eating something. OK. Want me to rustle up something? What would you like? Your... favourite would be good. Got it. You know, my buddies like this. The spiciness heats you up. A Sherpa friend of mine makes it without knowing its name. Able to use chopsticks? This is great. It's spicy. Crazy spicy. Dear. Here. Rintaro. OK. It's ready. Miyako. Hey... I... It can wait. Let's eat. Naoto, I'll get you some. Can you eat tofu? You must be tired. Listen. There's something I want you two to know. What's that? About your father. And Shun. And me. And our family. I want you to know. Years ago, your father and Shun used to go climbing a lot. Remember? Well, do you remember the last time they went climbing? Your father told Shun something then. I wanted to tell you too. All this time, I wanted to. Back then, I wanted to tell you when we were all together. But you were still little, so I couldn't. I'm sorry. What was it? Your father and I... met at a book launch. At the time... I was married. Shun was in junior high. Your father and your birth mother were separated. That's when the two of us met. Don't want to hear this? Maybe you can't understand why we did what we did. I didn't understand it myself. It wasn't a simple problem and I couldn't find a solution. I knew... I was being selfish. Even so... Even so... the last thing I wanted to do... was leave him. Then... my husband found a solution. He... tried to end his own life. I found out about that... quite a while after I came to live here. I couldn't bring myself to tell Shun. Then the day came... when I received word that he'd died. My husband... had been in a coma for five years. All that time, he was lying in bed unconscious. Your father told Shun everything that time they went climbing. He took responsibility... for everything. That was selfish. That was selfish of you. It was. What the hell... were you thinking? Doing something like that to your children... Aren't you ashamed? How the hell could we understand? You and Dad... Breaking and making families so selfishly... You didn't care about us! We were so... We don't share the same blood. How would you know how I feel? Don't use the word "family" like you know what it means. Huh? What does it mean? What is a family? You've got one. Tell me. That's... Marrying, having kids gaining parents you don't know and relatives you hardly see... No, I just don't get it. I don't understand at all. Why did you marry Kosuke? Why make a family with him? Isn't it just a burden? It's a burden all right. Why wouldn't it be? Then why... It's beyond understanding. It can't be explained. But, you know I don't regret it. If I could go back in time to that moment... I'd probably just... have made the same decisions. You know becoming a family with you... isn't something I regret. After you left, I waited. I waited, thinking... that if you came back to us... we could start over. I'm sorry, Miyako. I'm sorry. After we finished eating and the relatives left Mum showed us all a diary. Dad wrote in it the night he got lost. Lots of mentions of food with supplementary notes. A few days after Dad was diagnosed as terminal he climbed a snowy mountain. Mum told us he went up there to prepare himself for the worst. Various dishes, and accompanying memories. What went through Dad's mind in the freezing cold as he wrote in that diary? Shun, Miyako, Rintaro, Akiko. Together again, someday. We knew so little... about each other. Thank you for taking the time to bid farewell to Hitoshi. We're deeply grateful. About yesterday... I never gave much thought to our relationship but now I know... I've been taking you for granted. There's nothing going on between me and my high school friend, really. I want to... treat you right. Funeral food isn't tasty. I'm not too excited. How can they talk about food? We'll collect Dad's bones later. They'll forget about him in no time. Akiko... The day before Hitoshi went up that mountain we drank together. He didn't look well, and he didn't say much. But before he left, pretty drunk he mumbled to himself, "This takes me back." "This takes me back"? That's right. He said it while eating boiled mushrooms which he usually never touched. Strange, huh? Mushrooms? Hitoshi was a fussy eater, right? When we drank he'd pop food he didn't like in my dish. Hey. Why did that pizza yesterday have shimeji mushrooms? I think Shun likes them. Yeah. He put them on it for me. Huh? But he hated them too. Shiitake in sukiyaki was another big no-no. What else... Oh, he basically didn't eat fish. Even canned tuna. "It's still tuna, darn it!", he'd insist. You knew, Mum? He had us fooled. He always ate it so happily. He only made mushroom pizza when climbing. What's that? Just family stuff. Hey, don't leave me out. So, what did Dad like? Good question... Rie. Your girlfriend? Well... Hey... I'm... sorry. Daisuke, Miki, go stand with your mum. Yeah, good. Hey. Get in the picture. Come over here. —I'm fine here. —Come on! Rintaro, you'll be standing here, right? Come here. Join us! Sorry. Sit. Taro, sit. —Ready? —Good dog. Here we go. How many seconds? 12. —12? —Yes. —It clicked. —Did it work? —It clicked. —It worked? Good stuff. Is it perfect? It's perfect. We got it. Rock, Paper, Scissors! Sorry you had to come such a long way. No, I'm sorry for coming at a time like this. Thank you. I hope you like this. Sorry, my timing might be off, but... Thank you. You made those? Pretty much. I'll have one. I should be going... Oh, yes! Bean cakes! Bean cakes were Hitoshi's favourite! Hey! Are you OK?
