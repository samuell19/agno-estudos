Nina! Dax! The hacienda of Jaime Xenos, attorney at law. A traitor. You'll find all his family there. Wife, Vera Xenos, daughter, Teresa Xenos, age 1 6... son, Dax Xenos, age 1 0. They're all traitors. -You understand? -I understand, Col. Gutierrez. Quickly, Dax. Come. -They shot Nina. -Come, close the gate. Come on. Soldiers. Quick, bolt the windows and doors. Everybody in the cellar. Come on. Go! Hurry! But, Mama.... -Here's Teresa. -Close the door. Come on. -Come on, Mama. -Get down! Now be quiet. Where's Papa? He'll come. Just be quiet, he'll come. Don't be afraid, I am here. Be quiet. They'll kill us. Mama! Animal! Dax! Run. For God's sake, run! Find Papa! -The chickens are dead. -Where's your mother? And my dog, Nina. Your mother, boy. She is dead. All are dead. Vera. It's all safe now. Papa's here. It is my duty to read to you the following pronouncement. ''The Revolutionary Tribunal... ''for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Corteguay... ''established on the twenty-first day of March... ''1 94 5... ''under the Presidency of His Excellency, Gen. Rojo... ''charged with crimes... -''with crimes against....'' -Guilty. Death. You, Jaime... your wife, your daughter. I am not an executioner. -Let me kill them. -No. -I will. -He's a child. There are no children in war, only men. Come here, boy. Now, look at them. Now say, ''For Corteguay... ''for my mother, for my sister, for Corteguay.'' ''For my mother, for my sister, for Corteguay.'' Gutierrez! Gutierrez and more of his dogs. Many more. -We ride. -The boy? To my family in the mountains. Fat Cat! Take the boy to my hacienda. Be brave, Dax. I am not a child anymore. No. You are not a child anymore. Bless you, my son. -Take care of my boy. -With my life, se?or. Thank you. Come. Condor, we ride! -Why are you always looking? -We must be careful. We do not want to meet that man Gutierrez. This man, Gutierrez, did he kill my mother and my sister? Yes. Then, one day, I shall kill him. -Are you hungry? -No. One of the women of the farm give me the breakfast. -She was crying. -Women always cry. I don't cry. Cry? You? You are a man. Men do not cry. Papa cried at the graveside. -I cried, too. -Well, that was permissible. Even I cried, but now we are men again. Yes. Sometimes it is not always easy being a man. But come, you follow me. I will lead you safely through the mountains. -Fat Cat. It's a great day. -Why? The General rides on Curatu. Everywhere the people are with us. Soon no more revolutions... -because the way will be ours. -Good. Dax. Yes, Dona Maria. His sister and mama.... Come here. Poor little boy. This is my son, Roberto. Amparo, this is Dax. Se?or Xenos' son. You may kiss me. Amparo, show Dax to his room and then you both can play until dinner. -Play? -Games. Games? I don't play games. Petrucha says you've got rubber legs. Better than a wooden head. What are you doing? I'm watching for Gutierrez. It's Fat Cat. -What are they doing? -Playing. -What are they doing now? -I suppose he's raping her. -Raping? -He rapes her and she rapes him. -Let's do it. -No. You are too young. And I think I have to kill you afterwards. Fat Cat! Mama. Amparo! Dax! I want Mama. -Mama. Where is my Mama? -Come on! Amparo! Mama! What are they doing to Mama? Nothing. Don't look. They're all dead, Col. Gutierrez. Gutierrez. So much for the traitor, Diablo Rojo. The rebels are advancing on Curatu. Collect your men. We must go. I want Mama and Roberto. We must go to Curatu. Come on. Soldiers. Petrucha. Petrucha is dead. We must bury her. God keep Petrucha... Mama and Roberto. Come to bed. But we are not married. All right, I marry you. But now we go to sleep. Is that all there is? That's all. Go to sleep. Curatu. Dax! Amparo. Dax. -Are you all right? -Yes. I thought you were both dead. Why aren't you in the Palace? How could I have faced them? Come, I will take you to your fathers. -Right. -Come. My dear friends... now we will build a new Corteguay for the people of Corteguay. Food for all, justice for all, peace for all. Yes. But at what cost? -Daddy! -Dax. Amparo. My child. Fat Cat, you didn't die. I do not think so, se?or. How did you escape the massacre? I.... He hid us from the soldiers, and walked us all the way here. No, it-- And he killed two men with his bare hands... and there was snakes and scorpions and he saved us from them. We stole chickens, Papa, we ate grass. Well, I could not get word to you. They might have been caught. In that case I would have had you shot. Of course, General. Thank you, Fat Cat. Get them to bed, as soon as possible. This time you took me safely through the mountains... I will never forget that. How do you feel, Son? There are great plans ahead, Dax. We are going to Europe, to Italy. I'm to be Ambassador of Corteguay in Rome. -And Fat Cat? -He'll come, too. And Col. Gutierrez... when can I kill him? Dax, the fighting's over. There will be no more violence. I can't forget what he did. You must. We have to think now only of Corteguay as it will be. When you come back, you won't be a boy anymore. You'll be a man. Now, good night, Dax. And dream of Rome. Good night, Papa. -What are you doing here? -I listened. You're going away. Yeah, I'm going away forever. No, you're not. You'll come back and I'll marry you properly. I'm never going to marry anyone. I don't want a wife and family... because the soldiers will come and kill them. -Se?or Xenos? -Yes. We've been expecting you. My name is Marcel Campion. I'm the Senior Clerk here. Please. Signor Barone... His Excellency Jaime Xenos, our new Ambassador. Your Excellency, il Barone de Coyne... President of the de Coyne Bank. My son, Dax. I know of all you've done for my country, Barone. I'm deeply grateful. No need, se?or. My family haven't achieved an international reputation as bankers... being philanthropic. Here in Italy, the de Coyne bank... invested money in Corteguay as a matter of good business. There are times when one wonders, of course. Your predecessor was frightened, Your Excellency, and greedy. -There is nothing left. -No funds? The de Coyne Bank has confidence in your new regime, se?or. It would be a breach of faith to withdraw our support now. You are very kind. Have you any plans for your son's schooling? -I hadn't thought. -Leave it to me then. He shall go to the Institute della Rocca with my son. -I will make all the arrangements. -I am overwhelmed. Come and see me tomorrow. We'll discuss the future of your son and of Corteguay. Thank you. You'll continue to work here, Campion, and keep me informed. Unless I am offered something better. This will encourage you to stay, at least for the time being. Of course, Signor Barone, thank you. Robert. How are you? Robert, this is Dax. Look after him. -Hello there, Robert. -Hello, Sergei. Prince Paul Nikovitch, Se?or Xenos. -How do you do? -How do you do? Sergei Nikovitch, a friend of Robert's. Can we go now, Father? Of course. Run along. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, Father. Fat Cat. But why do I have to fight any of you? To see whose room you share. If you win, you could choose who you like. All right then, I'll fight you. Sergei wins all his fights. Why not fight me? I always lose. Thanks. But I have chosen already. -Boxing or free-for-all? -Free-for-all. I choose you. For my roommate. Sergei, take them in. Robert, take them out. Dax doesn't play polo, he wages war. Isn't he wonderful, Father? Bravo! Come on, leave me alone. -Hello, Father. -Would you like champagne? -Sergei. -Hey, se?or, Dax. Thank you, Robert. -Did you enjoy the match? -You play a hard game. I play to win. Dax, I have to go to Corteguay. -For long? -Two or three weeks perhaps. -I'll come with you. -Not this time. Stay young as long as you can. Is there trouble in Corteguay? There are rumors. I must see for myself. You worry too much, Father. You work too hard. I love my country. The revolution. I live to see its promises fulfilled. A toast. To patriotism. No. To horses and pretty girls. Go, and enjoy yourself. -Thank you. See you later. -Bye. I'll give you a drink. My father is away. Let's have a party at the villa! The last car at the villa, the girl in it must pay a forfeit. Why do you drive so fast? Are you afraid I'll have to pay the forfeit if you get there last? I couldn't care less. I drive to win. Beautiful, isn't it? Like a dream. One doesn't always have beautiful dreams. Come and swim. -In five minutes at the pool. -Yes. Would you say... it's quite in character to leave me at the polo field... bring that girl back here to my father's house... and then in the morning make love to me, too? Why not? Why you don't feel a twinge of guilt or of old-fashioned remorse? Why feel guilt or remorse about love? -Love? -Well, about making love. Love's just a word to you, isn't it? But the way you behave can hurt. I know bullets hurt. -Knives hurt. -And that's all? You want me to apologize for bringing that girl back? -No, that's not the point. -Then? Well, I'd like to know what it is you really care about. You see, it isn't girls. You don't make love to girls, you make love at them. If I could understand what you're saying. Dax. I love you. If you could tell me what it feels like to love. You will appreciate, Signor Barone, I felt it my duty. I don't wish to cause trouble. You'll wake her. -Father? -Yes. Sergei. Where is your sister? Is she here? No, she didn't come. You disgrace me. You disgrace the family. Dax Xenos, Sergei, the rest of them turning my house into a brothel. I'll give you a last chance. Get rid of them. All of them. The whole pack. Any more of this, I am finished. Your credit, your allowance, finish. Do you understand me? You will speak of this to no one, Campion. You may trust me implicitly, Signor Barone. You mentioned... you might find a better position for me in your bank. From Monday you'll be in charge of the Shipping Department. Thank you, Signor Barone. My dear Jaime, welcome home. An unexpected honor, Se?or Presidente. For an unexpected visit. How's Dax? He lives his own life. That one will always make his own rules. He's not afraid to walk alone. And Amparo, how is she? She's well... at a convent school in the country. But tell me more about Dax. He's mad about polo. I think he may play for Italy. Viva Rojo! -The old Palace of Justice. -Now obsolete. The new palace of the President. But there were houses, streets, the marketplace. All swept away. Now the Plaza del Presidente Rojo. The people voted unanimously to give it my name. Including the people who lived there? The people have no gratitude. I give them progress and what do they do? You heard that El Condor is now against me? El Condor? -But El Condor was our friend. -No, Jaime. Ask a man to be your friend and he feels indebted to you. I don't trust friends. But enemies, real enemies... I trust them implicitly. Magnificent, huh? Take this old man, El Condor. I know what he wants. To destroy me. If he tries, he knows what I shall do. We understand each other. We're enemies. There's no pretense, but with a friend.... The Cabinet Room. Magnificent, huh? Was all the money I begged for Corteguay poured into this? My dear friend, we did not fight for this. Our wives and children did not die for this. This is not worth one drop of their precious blood. I see you learned nothing in Rome. A nation's glory is in its architecture. Then build houses for the people, not palaces for yourself. And how many houses do you think I could've built for them? A few thousand for some of the people. No! I built one palace for all the people. But you're here on holiday. You need a rest. How long do you intend to stay? I'm at your service, Se?or Presidente. But I'd like to go to my hacienda to visit my wife's grave. Of course. El Condor. Thank you for coming, Jaime. But nobody knows you're here? -Nobody. -You've seen Rojo? -Yes. -Then you've seen the devil. He's 1 0 times worse than the last. Palaces, roads, guns, soldiers... and the people starve. I've seen them. Have you seen the prisons, the execution yards... the bodies rotting in the pits, a feast for vultures? I told the President he was wrong. You told him? And you are wrong to take up arms again. Hasn't this poor country seen enough of civil war? Enough? No, not enough. Are we women to be beaten and oppressed? -There are legal ways. -There's only one way. Have you forgotten the things we once fought for, Jaime Xenos? We fight for justice with justice. You mustn't use the weapons of tyranny even against a tyrant. How else can you destroy him? So long as Rojo rules by force... I will oppose him by force. Sit down, Gutierrez. Thank you. Well? Friendship is a wonderful thing, Se?or Presidente. Friendship? -You're not my friend. -No indeed. Just an old enemy. Too useful not to be employed. Must you always play games, Colonel? I am naturally devious, Se?or Presidente. However, you had a friend, Jaime Xenos. -Had? -He's gone to see another old friend. They're talking, reminiscing no doubt... as old friends will. What friend? El Condor. Jaime Xenos and El Condor. Why do you always bring bad news, Gutierrez? A Chief of Security never brings good news. There's no gratitude, Gutierrez. They envy me. I who made this country great. They envy me, my position in history. Jaime Xenos and El Condor. A bandit alone is nothing but a bandit. A bandit and a lawyer... is a revolution. The honor conferred on me by El Presidente in allowing me... to open the cable line to Mirados... and be the first to cross this great chasm with his greetings. El Presidente is the head of our nation... but the body, the hands, the heart, and the soul are our people... and I take their greetings to the people of Mirados in the sure conviction... that we shall march together to a bright future of peace and prosperity. Thank you. Breathe in. Good, you'll live. Yes? Just a minute. God, 3:00. Morning or afternoon? Morning. Fat Cat, do you know what time it is? All right. I'll come. When am I going to see you again? When I call you. Fire! I should have gone with him. He was the last. Dax. Don't you remember me? We were children together. Amparo. So long ago, but I don't forget. I loved him. Tragedy. Something no one could have foreseen. It might have happened to me, I shall never forget that. I feel... a responsibility to you. You've always been like a son to me. Dax, your father gave his life for Corteguay. I want you to take his place. I'm not fit to take his place. That's not true. You're a Corteguayan. A Xenos. I'm a Corteguayan who lives in Rome. A Xenos, yes, the last of my family and the least. A man should never condemn himself... there are always others who are willing to do it for him. Did your father ever speak to you of El Condor? I know who you mean. Once our comrade, still a rebel. I've tried everything to make peace with him. Offered him amnesty. Dax, now I want you to try. Give him anything he asks for. A free pardon, safe conduct for his men. Food and medicine for the women and children. You're a Xenos, he'll listen to you. I'm not a politician, Se?or Xenos. I'm only a simple murderer. But this I do know. I don't want my son to spend the rest of his life in these hills. Hunted day and night. El Presidente guarantees peace. You'll be a respected citizen of Corteguay. Once I had eight sons and three daughters. They're all dead now. All but this one. No one will be harmed. El Presidente promised it. These are Rojo's promises. He asks you to trust him, El Condor. There will be no reprisals. An honorable peace. If you will guarantee the safety of my son... you personally... swearing on the soul of your father and on the cross... then I will accept El Presidente's offer. I swear it. Very well then. Tell Rojo I'll meet him in Asiento on the last day of this month. There will be no more war between us. My father's very pleased with you. You know that? The question is what now? You mean do you stay? Do you want to? I don't know. I don't feel involved. Come with me. When you were a child, you killed seven men with that gun. I remember that. I pleaded with your father to let me do it. Like it or not, Dax, you are involved. All right. I'll be involved with the future... but not the past. The past has its uses, too, you know. No. None. Do you remember when you dragged me, complaining across the mountains? Yeah, I remember that. And we slept in the forest? And you made me marry you. -Yes. -And before that we sat in the reeds. Fat Cat was in the stream with one of the maids. You asked me what they were doing. And I said ''He rapes her.'' ''And she rapes him.'' -That's right. -We were very young. Viva! Viva El Condor! Diablo Rojo. I have come in response to your request. I accept your offer of amnesty. Let there be peace between us. In the name of Corteguay, I pledge my faith. In the name of Corteguay, I hope you keep it. You see, I've kept my word. Now Jose can go to school and learn to behave like a gentleman. Well, at least he can learn to read and write. Come inside, my friend, and have some champagne. Give me the red wine of Corteguay. And keep that cat's piss for the women. I'm sure the good God will be glad to see his house put to useful service again. No! Gutierrez. Dax Xenos. I have my orders. He was a traitor. I have no orders to kill you. But if I must, I will. I heard guns firing. You did this. -You! -No. I didn't know. You promised him! And you lied! -Believe me, I didn't know. -You lie! Some day I shall kill you for this. -Jose! -No. Let him go. Back to the mountains where he'll be safe. Gutierrez, explain Gutierrez. He was there carrying out your orders. -No. -He said so. Then he lied. He lied, Dax, and he shall answer for it. He has answered, to me. I see. Do you deny he was working for you... the man who killed most of your family and mine? -You employed him. -Yes, I did. And me? Did you employ me, too? To lie for you? Betray for you? A man must use what weapons he can to defend his country, Dax. -Treachery? -Treachery is a weapon. -You admit you used me? -I've loved you, Dax. As a boy and as a man. What is love but the use of one person by another? No. -Then, for the love of Corteguay. -Words. Words with no meaning to them. I trusted you. I would have done anything for you! And you? I leave.... -I leave for Europe tomorrow. -Yes, go. I order you to go. And understand this, Dax. Until you've learned that evil and politics must tolerate each other... there's no place for you here. Please, Dax, take me with you. No. Your place is here with me. Not anymore. I've seen too much suffering and misery. -And now this. -You are my daughter. A daughter of the President. You expect me to take pride in that? I expect nothing of you. I order you to stay. You stay. And you go, Dax... while you can. Such a small country, and so much blood. I should have brought Amparo with me. She was all I had left of my childhood. You know... I have nothing now. No money, nothing. You are alive and I am still here. Yes. And someday when you are rich again, you can come back. To more bloodshed? -More misery? -To put an end to it. There will come a day. Do you think I care about that patch of scrub? -Yes. -Yes, maybe I do. But if I ever come back, it won't be to help Rojo. I'll have money. I'll do anything to get money. Money and power, and then I shall I come back. Capt. Dax reporting, sir. What time do you call this? I'm starving. Is this all? -You've spilt wine on my suit. -Our suit. This chicken's over-cooked. You're lucky to get anything. We had trouble at the restaurant. The Baron stopped Robert's credit. -How did you pay? -We didn't. The girls did. -Good. -No, you don't seem to realize. My father has disowned me. Now we're really broke. How about your father? I can try, but he's done too much already. He's not rich, you know. Sergei. -Papa. -I am indeed privileged. It's rare to see you. Still scrawling away? -I'm still designing clothes. -Which never get made. Not yet. When I left Russia... I slaved to give you the education an aristocrat deserves... but you don't even seem able to make a success of dress-making. -Designing. -Yes. If I had some capital, Papa.... No. I don't want money from you. Nonsense. I never see you unless you do. Thank you. I have to go now. I'm on duty. Duty is an older coinage than money. When I was a young man at the court of Czar Nicholas... I learned the meaning of both. Yes, Papa. There. A title needs a good uniform, don't you think? Yes, Papa. -Hello there. -Hello, Marcel. -April. -Hi, Marcel. You haven't met Dax. Robert de Coyne. Sergei. -Hello. -April Stavronis. -How do you do? -How do you do? April and I are engaged to be married. Married? -Since when? -Last night. Congratulate us. -We do. -We do. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -You're a lucky man, Marcel. -I know that. Darling, will you give me five minutes? Yes. I have to go down and change anyhow. Well, I'll see you later. -Bye-bye. -Goodbye. See you later. My God, Marcel. She's a dog. But a rich dog. You've heard of Stavronis Munitions. You should do the same, my boy. As a matter of fact, that's why we asked you to meet us, Marcel. We are going into business, all of us. -A dress salon. -What a good idea. We'll start with a fabulous show in some ancient Roman setting. Who's financing you? That's where we need your advice, Marcel. All we need is some capital to get us started. -And what do you offer as collateral? -Collateral? As security against the loss of the money advanced to you. In business there is no such thing as a loan without collateral. There's your capital and no collateral. There are plenty more like her in Rome. Americans, tourist, rich, lonely, bored. I know of one or two likely prospects. I could introduce you. Sergei? It's disgusting. I like it. Dax? Robert? Look, I am sorry, I don't think this is for me. -Why? -Well, it's just that.... -You don't mind, do you? -It's all right. That will cost you thirty-three and one-third percent of anything you get. -1 5%. -25%. Done! Let's have a drink to celebrate. Four champagne cocktails. And put them on Miss Stavronis' bill. Room 409. A little kiss? You're very handsome, you know that? Then we must be the best-looking couple in Rome. Your husband is in business in Chicago, Mrs. Erickson? Yeah, he's a meat baron. -Sounds impressive. -It's disgusting. Raw, red meat, that's all he's interested in. Then we'll go to a restaurant that serves the best fish in Rome. Wonderful. You need some money? If you like. Thank you. -Enough? -Yes, for the taxi. Funny boy. -Sorry. -It's all right. Thank you. Good evening. Mrs. Hadley? Yes, that's me. You must be.... Dax Xenos. Won't you come in? Marcel has told me all about you. Has he? Really, it's just that I don't know anyone in Rome and.... You need someone to show you the sights and.... That's right. I mean, not the Coliseum and St. Peter's. I'm not quite as provincial as that. I can see you are not. Maybe this whole thing's a little ridiculous? Why don't we have a drink and then decide that? All right. -Scotch? -Yes, please. -On the rocks? -Straight. Straight. -Where do you come from, Mrs. Hadley? -California. My husband's in oil. That must be very uncomfortable for him. -Cheers. -Cheers. You look five years younger this morning. That makes 1 5 years in three days. By the time I go home.... I don't want to think about that. Nor do I. -Do you mean that? -Yes. I mean it. Then I'm happy again. Good morning, Baron. Nice to see you. Indeed? Allow me to introduce... Il Barone de Coyne, Mrs. Deborah Hadley. Glad to meet you, Baron. Mrs. Hadley is over here on vacation from the States. I hope you're enjoying your visit, signora. Indeed I am. But who could not in Rome on a day like this? True. And now, if you'll excuse us? Baron, who is that man? Pretty girl, who is she? He's nothing. If you meet him again, please ignore him. He's a very dangerous man. Sue Ann Daley. They say before long she's going to be the richest girl in the world. Now, what would you like to do this afternoon? Only one more day. Then we won't waste it. I was never young in America. But you're going home. To your family, to things that really matter to you. How do you know what matters to me? I can't go back. Of course you can. You have to. Don't make it difficult for me, too. All my married life, there was no one else. And now.... I've got a present for you. Thank you. It's beautiful. The most beautiful cigarette case I have ever possessed. Thanks. Thank you, signore, signori. I must tell you, signore, signori... that none of this would have been possible without... the generous assistance of Mrs. Lafayette Erickson. Mrs. Erickson? And I must also thank my friend and partner... Dax Xenos, who has worked so hard... and so enthusiastically to make this show a success. Dax? Lastly, I would like to thank Julius Caesar for the loan of the hall. Thank you. I don't know what you see in that young man. If you ask me he's a goddamned fairy. The wedding dress. We'll buy it. For the wedding of the year, the bride must have the dress of the year. I'm sure she can afford it. I met a divine painter in London, and we put on this show for him. He was terrific, he'd put a little squiggle here.... Do you know Sue Ann Daley? Only by sight. My father's one of her trustees. We were friends at school. The way you are looking at her, you won't be friends much longer. Excuse me. -Hello. -Hello. I'm Dax Xenos. I know. I'm told you're the kind of person who's only interested in my money. -Is that true? -Of course. A hideous girl like you, what else could it be? Anyway, I didn't say I was interested. -Hello. -Is it a success? Yes, I think so, but nobody except Marcel bought anything. I'd like to buy. -Buy what, Miss Daley? -Everything. Everything? The collection? Everything and the collection. Well, thank you, I'm honored and rich. Thank you. Who's that man who keeps following you? Big Dennis. -Detective? -Nanny. Three weeks more. Good evening, Baron. Madame, sir. You have a beautiful home. You are too kind. I have heard so much about you. As Miss Daley's Trustees, we are happy to welcome her friends tonight. But I'm not aware that you were invited. Thank you. I'm delighted to be here. -Hello, Caroline. -Hello. -Congratulations, darling, you look beautiful. -Thank you. -Hello, Sue Ann. -Hi. -Sue Ann. -Yeah. -Hi. -Hello. -You look wonderful tonight. -Thanks. You know what? For the first time in my life... I'm actually refusing food. Maybe for the first time in your life, you're happy. Maybe. Big Dennis, your time's running out, you know. Good evening. I might rather miss him. -Suppose I get lonely? -I'll be here. Will you? Hello. Let's talk about my next collection. And dance. -Marriage suits you, April. -I'm very happy. -You should try it. -No, thank you. Marriage is one of the few temptations I've always resisted. Why don't you let yourself go for once and marry me? Unfortunately, your father doesn't approve of me. You mean he wouldn't keep you in the style to which you've become accustomed? Possibly. Happy birthday! I'm free! -Tell me. -No, you tell me. -I love you. -What? I love you. Many happy returns! As Miss Daley's Trustees... we will authorize the payment of $400,000... and an allowance of $4,000 a month... both to take effect after the wedding ceremony. I don't really think I could make Miss Daley very happy on a pittance like that. Then what do you think you should have? When a man's wife is heiress to $80 million... he can't walk around with pennies in his pocket. What kind of an impression would that make? Would $500,000 and $5,000 a month make a better impression? Slightly. If you multiply it by two. -By two. -Nonsense. We are totally opposed to this marriage, Xenos. We know what you are. And it's our duty to protect Miss Daley as far as we can. $500,000 and $5,000 a month is our last offer. Well, that's a pity. It looks so bad for the heir to one of the largest fortunes in the world... to be a bastard. Heir? What heir? From Miss Daley's gynecologist. I'm sorry. Now, take it easy. He'll be here, I promise. Well, where is he then? Damn him. He's so late. Where was he last night? The stag party went on until breakfast, so.... This is really humiliating. Well, it's the last time he marries me. -I'm beginning to feel hungry again. -No. Oh, God. Where have you been? Come along, will you? Fat Cat. Welcome back. Dax will be so glad to see you. He's missed you. Sit down. Where is he? You've known Dax most of his life, haven't you? You don't think I can make him happy, do you? Do you think you can, signora? That is what matters. I don't know. I want him to feel for me as I do for him, but.... Dax does not feel things like other men. For women, you mean? Women. Everything. He just does not feel. That's why.... When the baby comes that'll make a difference, won't it? It could. Yes, it could. -You'll get me all wet, you. -Where have you been all these weeks? Well, you think I cannot get along without you? -Here. -What? I've brought this for you to see. From my cousin in Corteguay. Read it. -Pretty bad, huh? -Well... the sugar crops are ruined by storms every year. And the Secret Police, the curfew, and the prison camps. That is Corteguay. It always will be. Until someone stops it. It can't be stopped. -Dax. -Yes? Come push me, Dax. Push me higher, Dax. Higher. Higher now. Sue Ann. Are you all right? I think so. Oh, no. They've told you, haven't they, that I lost the baby? Yes. When you get out of here, we'll go away somewhere. I should like that. Forgive me. I'm so sorry. I know. You wanted it to be a boy. So did I. We'll try again. And next time we'll have a perfect baby. I'll nurse myself like an invalid. I won't swim. I won't dance. I won't even sit on a swing. And I'll present you with the fattest little Dax you ever saw. That's right. No. I'm lying. I'm lying, Dax, I'm not telling you the truth. I can never have another baby. I know. They told you? Why did you let me go on? You mustn't upset yourself. I've let you down, haven't I? No, of course not. Yes. You married me for my money, Dax, I know that. Well, I'm rich. I can give you everything you want. Everything except.... The baby was so important. It would have kept us together. -I'm afraid now, Dax. -No. You mustn't be afraid. Nothing's changed. Nothing's different. Please, don't leave me. You must sleep now. A rich man with a wife he doesn't love, who can't give him children. What happens to him, Fat Cat? El Lobo. -It's almost time. -We're ready for them, El Lobo. Listen. Two flight arrivals in one week. A record. Military aid. These two are loaded with arms. Presidente is getting nervous. Ride! Excuse me. Mr. Xenos, I'd like to ask you a few questions. I'm from Teen magazine. Well, we all have our cross to bear. Is it true that you've made love to every woman in this room? Not yet. You've been married three times? And I've been co-respondent three times. Why have all your wives been among the richest women in the world? It was a deeply emotional experience. Did I ever tell you about-- Thank you. Did you take the key to my apartment last night? I can't find it anywhere. -See you tonight. -I'm sorry. I have to go home with Sue Ann. Sue Ann. I don't know why you always have to.... I'm sorry, I forgot. She's been your wife, too. How is Sue Ann? -I haven't spoken to her yet. -I haven't even seen her today. You can always tell an old married couple by the way they avoid each other. Yes. Excuse me, Dax, will you? Is that my husband making his getaway? How are you? You look marvelous. I haven't stopped eating for six months. -I'm sorry. -That's the way it goes. Perhaps I shouldn't have married either of you. -Would I have been happier then? -No. Just fatter. Where did you go this year? Oh, around. -Morocco, Italy. -Mexico? To divorce Kiki. You're working faster than me. You don't mind me still wearing your ring? -Just one more. -This way, please. Thank you. Please may I have your autograph, Miss Leonardi? I saw your Traviata at La Scala, Milan. It was a deeply emotional experience. -It was meant to be. -Thank you. Since when have you been interested in opera, Marcel? Since I bought her recording company. Excuse me. Are the phones always busy at Teen magazine? Not if you dial BR-98700. It's special from the Embassy. Must be important. -Embassy? -The Corteguayan Embassy. ''El Presidente is pleased to invite you to the unveiling of a memorial... ''to Jaime Xenos. ''Patriot and freedom fighter.'' You will not refuse to go? That's why I don't like it. I can't refuse. If only we were celebrating a more happy occasion. But your poor father would have been delighted. Se?or, my poor father would have been disgusted. He was a man of peace. I can't help myself. So long as there are still bandits in the hills... and this one who calls himself El Lobo. Do you think I'd want all this? No, houses, Dax, hospitals, schools... food, tractors, a five-year plan. What do you think? It will be very good to be a Corteguayan... in five years' time. You've been away from your country too long, Dax. I didn't sentence myself to exile. A new Corteguay. Modern, progressive. But how to pay for it? Where is the country that will lend us the money? America? That's where you got your money, isn't it, Dax? Three American wives. Three American bank accounts. Did you bring me here to discuss my profession? Sit down, Dax. Over there, beside me. That's better. Now, Dax, I'll be frank with you. -I need your help. -Don't ask, se?or. In America, there is an organization sponsored by the Government. The Overseas Aid Committee. Now, if Dax Xenos... the famous Dax Xenos were to approach a member of that committee.... -You have the wrong man. -No, I have the right man. The man who loves his country and who will fight for his country. Dax... will you try? Well, at least consider it. We can talk again. You don't have to decide at once. All right. I'll consider it. You know, it seems so natural to have you sitting there at my right hand. I wish, well.... One day, perhaps. Champagne? We both need it. First of all, when I heard you were coming to Corteguay... I felt I couldn't meet you. Were you afraid? Of you? No. You're safe here, anyway. It had to be here. I'm not allowed to leave. -You are a prisoner? -Yes. But I stay willingly now. The nuns are kind. They're my friends. Your father did this to you? Yes. But I have accepted it. He kills his enemies. Here I've learned to love them. I'm quite happy. But you're not free. Not as you mean it, no. -Because you are the President's daughter. -Yes. But for that, you and I.... Sometimes I hear of you. Your wives, the parties... in Paris, Rome, New York. I imagine I'm there with you instead of here. You and I, it was a long time ago. For me it was yesterday. Yesterday never happens again. No? No. Before you go.... There's something I must show you. Hello. Hello. Look. Butterfly. Butterflies. Don't you know him? -What's your name? -Marcus Phillipe. Phillipe? Phillipe Xenos. Do you have any kisses for me? -Only one left. -What, only one? You went away. Married. Became rich. You got to go away for good? Now I'm richer. You'll take good care of him? Always. May I see you again when I come back? Will you come back? Whatever I decide, I shall come back. It's not easy for me, Dax. -It hurts. -I know. But yes. Whenever you like. I hope. Dax, you know I can't take this kind of music. Why did you bring me? I'm wondering that myself. Who are all these strange people? Well, you did ask me to invite them. -Hello, Marcel. -Hi. I want to talk to you. Is there somewhere quiet? Private? Private? Why yes. Come along. Dax, what do I do? Enjoy the music, darling. Enjoy the music. Is she that loud in bed? Don't just stand there, Robert. Get drinks for the guests. What the hell's going on? It's very funny. At last we've got.... At last we've got something in common. It's very funny. Sue Ann? Yes. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere private. Some of my best deals have been made in these rooms. -But who comes here? Your wife? -April? She doesn't even know the place exists. Very few people do. Well, what do you want to talk to me about? Corteguay. They need money. A loan. When have they not? How much do they want? About $60 million. For tractors, medical equipment, that sort of thing. And you have to raise this loan? I said I'll try. Makes sense. Have you any contact with the Overseas Aid Committee? Overseas Aid Committee? Let's see. James Hadley. Vice Chairman. He'd be your best bet. -You know him? -Yes. He's an oil man. I helped him with a merger last year. -Can you fix a meeting? -I could try. That will be great. Just like the old days. With the same old 1 5%? Not on a deal of this size. -3%. -7.5%. 5%. Okay. I'm a philanthropist. Well, Dax, my boy, I must say this... when Campion first told me who was sponsoring this loan... I had my doubts. After all, you do have, shall we say, a certain reputation? I know that, Mr. Hadley. Now that I've talked with you, I must admit. I'm impressed. -Thank you. -Most impressed. Maybe just a little envious, too. My wife. Just back from a little shopping trip. You'll be able to say hello, then fly right back to the airport. -I'm most grateful for your hospitality. -Not at all. About the loan, I'll put it before my committee on Wednesday. I've little doubt they'll see it my way. It means a great deal to me, Mr. Hadley. And to my country. That I know, boy, that I know. Hiya, sweetie. -How was Frisco? -Fine, just fine. I have a little surprise for you, honey. You're just in time to meet my friend, Dax Xenos. Happy to meet you, Mrs. Hadley. Dax flew in from New York yesterday. We're fixing up a little deal together. And now you're going, Mr. Xenos? I'm afraid so. I have to be back. The White House on the line, sir. Y'all excuse me, I'll be right back. And, honey, don't you listen to a word he says. He tells the same thing to all the wives. Thank you, Dax. You haven't changed. Heavier. Thicker around the middle. The all-American matron. Still beautiful. Still Deborah. You remember that much. One forgets the bad things, not the good. I'm glad. Maybe we both found happiness in Rome. But I was the lucky one. I brought my happiness back here. And kept it. -We shall meet again. -Of course. I hope you'll come and see us often. Yes. Cigarette? I promised myself, I'd never smoke again. You two, getting along all right? Dax, call me on Thursday. -I might have a little word for you by then. -I'll do that. Goodbye, Mrs. Hadley. -It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Xenos. -And for me, too. -Goodbye, Mr. Hadley. -Have a good trip. Thanks. I guess that's the last of the crates from here, mister. And the rest is being loaded in Miami? That's right, on Thursday. Tractors, cultivators, harvesters... -grain and fertilizers. -Fine. Well, are you satisfied? Now, you belong to Corteguay. -Will you go back soon? -I've done my job. I'm not needed there. I think there are some of those who do need you. Well, maybe. Maybe some day. Miss Daley, do you have any immediate plans after your divorce? Are there any plans after your divorce, Miss Daley? Hi. -Hello. -Hello, darling. For two people about to get a divorce, you look very close. Well, I promised him a holiday afterwards. -We are flying to Mexico tonight. -Yes? We might even fall in love all over again. And we might not. We can try. Prince Nikovitch, will you come with me? The hearing commences in a few moments. I don't think you met my wife. Darling, this is.... Don't stay. It's quite unimportant. At the end of it we shall still be the same people. -Goodbye, Dax. -Bye. It's like a public lavatory. I'm rather fond of it. I've been here before. And I suppose I'll go on coming here for the rest of my life. No. You'll find somebody. I'm the richest girl in the world. I don't find people, they find me. All I can afford to do is lose them. All rise. I thought I'd throw my own party here. A kind of going-away party. Just you and me. What's the matter with you, Robert? Are you sick? -No. -Are you in some kind of trouble? I've been thinking. How much you and Sergei and Marcel have all changed. How different you all are from those early days in Rome. How little I've changed. I'm still the same schoolboy who loses all his fights. Is that all you brought me out here to tell me? No. It's the ship. Your ship. It didn't dock in Miami on Thursday. Didn't dock? Why, what happened? -It docked in Panama on Sunday. -Panama? -It had no business in Panama. -Yes, it had. It took on a cargo of arms, tanks, artillery, and ammunition. Who did this? Marcel. Marcel and Rojo. When? Right after you had agreed to raise the loan. Marcel flew to Corteguay and fixed the deal. How long have you known? -I've known. -And you didn't warn me? I couldn't. Marcel made sure I couldn't. You see, I've never had very much courage, Dax. And Marcel introduced me to something which gave me courage. Oh, you bloody fool. Worry about your ship, not about me. I'm a dead man. As soon as Marcel knows, anyway. I'll take care of Marcel. What are you going to do? You'd better hurry, Dax. There's not very much time. I never can fix the last button, you know. You were saying? The poor always suffer the most. They have the least to defend themselves with. -This damn tie. -May I help? Please. You are an intelligent man, Marcel. Tell us, how can El Rojo defeat the guerillas? By killing them, I suppose. And how are those people killed, Marcel? With guns, of course. And who sells those guns to Rojo? Who gets paid by Rojo? Who made the double-cross to Mr. Xenos? You'll talk to us, Marcel. Now. You could never resist a deal, Marcel, could you? Come on. No! No, Dax. Please. Dax. No. -Let me go. -Take him. Dax, please. Just one more deal now, Marcel. With me. No. What do you want? Dax, I know nothing. Now. Where is that shipment of arms to dock, Marcel? I don't know. Honestly, I don't. The boat, where will it stop? Only Rojo knows that, I swear. Where? Puerto San Pablo on the north coast. When will it dock? I don't know. It's not certain. Nobody can hear you, Marcel. When? No. When? Tomorrow night. Then by train to Curatu. No. So uncivilized, isn't it? Dax! Please! You can't leave me like this. No. Please. Come back, Dax! Fat Cat, help me! Help me, I'll give you anything! Anything. Don't leave me like this. Don't make me.... I begin to believe you. Why should I lie? El Condor once trusted you. If this is another trap.... There is no trap. Viva El Lobo. Can I help you? No. What is it? Don't you recognize me? The boy of El Condor. -You are El Condor's son? -Yes. I don't forget you. I shall never forget you. You need help. Not from you. I'd rather die. It's a great day. Rojo is finished. Tomorrow, we attack the capital. Have you lost many men? Yes, but they lost more. I know what you are thinking, but you are wrong. My men aren't a rabble. They obey my orders. There will be no massacres, no raping and pillaging in this revolution. We'll fight to bring life to Corteguay... not death. Get on the train. On to Curatu! Rebel tanks. Fire! Fire! Machine guns! Fire! Charge! The situation is looking very satisfactory. Sir. General! The rebels are in the suburbs. What do you say to that? I say that they will be held and thrown back, Se?or Presidente. And I say the rebels are in the suburbs. Amparo. -What happened? -Gone. Where have they gone? I have six children, they are always hungry, se?or. Where? Curatu, to the Convent of Santa Maria. I know where it is, come on. That door. Amparo. Dax. -Phillipe? -Yes. Pillage. Rape. Destruction. Death. It's always the same. Not only in Corteguay. Other countries learn. Slowly, but they do learn. -But we have nothing. -No. They can have more. And you can have more, too. You and Phillipe. We'll go to Rome. When this is over... I'll go to the Palace, see El Lobo and arrange it. And what about my father? I'll do what I can. Rome. Is it possible? El Lobo can't refuse to let us go. He owes me more than that. And in Rome, what then? Will you leave me? Don't save me just to leave me, Dax. No, Amparo. You and I and Phillipe... we are all that's left of.... You're my family. Oh, God. You are my future. Is that enough? Yes. Yes, it's enough. I must go to the Palace. When it's safe, I'll send Fat Cat to fetch you. The Government is in full command. The revolution will be crushed... for the people do not want the revolution. Campesinos, farmers, workers... this is El Lobo, the voice of the revolution. Put down your arms. The fighting is over. Corteguay belongs to the revolution. Corteguay will always belong to the revolution. Aim! Fire! Fire! Where is Rojo? Where is Diablo? Where is Rojo? You hear how they roar for him? The tyrant is more popular than ever. What will you do to him? The voice of the people must be obeyed. They want him, they must have him. They'll tear him to pieces. You promised justice. At least a quick death. He will get the same justice he gave. I am a soldier. Gen. Rojo. There's no more Rojo in Corteguay. I demand a soldier's death. I taught you to kill. Remember? I steadied the gun in your hands. Kill me. Now. No. I can't. Dax, I loved you. Take him. Take him out of my Palace. Dax, your father! Your father! I killed him. He was killed on my orders, Dax. I murdered him. The plane is waiting for you at the airfield. For us. -Dax, what is it? -I have to stay. Not for long, but I can't come with you now. But why? The revolution's over. The fighting's over. That's all. What else is there? -You can't do any more to help, Dax. -Help? Who have I helped? Corteguay? To kill one tyrant and put another in his place. You can't change that now. I can try. El Lobo respects me. If I'm here, I can control him. -In a few weeks, I-- -No, Dax, you promised. Amparo, for my sake and Phillipe. You must go. You'll be safe in Rome. Fat Cat will look after you. I'll join you as soon as possible. Fat Cat. I stay with you, always. Not this time. They need you more than I do. My father wanted me to care as he did. Well, now at last I do care. I'm asking you, my friend, to help me. You have changed. Now you are like your father. Promise you will come soon. I promise. I found you yesterday. -Today-- -Don't think of today, Amparo. Only tomorrow. Goodbye, Dax. Until tomorrow. Take care of my son. As if he were you. Vtg
