"What is life? Nobody knows." "What is life? Nobody knows." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "What is life?" "What is life? Nobody knows." Hello! Aditya here. Be ready, I'm coming to pick you up. I love you. Surprise! - When did you come? An hour ago. I love you. You were going to come next week. Yes, but Calcutta was very hot, so I cut my trip short. Stupid, I missed you so much. You didn't even call me. How is your mom? - She's fine, but ask how I am. How are you? - I'm fine. But you look disappointed to see me. - Why? Are you having an affair in the office with some girl? I have to attend an office party. - Party? No, you cannot go to the party. You don't understand. My Boss will get angry. Even I'll come with you. You come after half an hour. Alright, but there is a whole hour to 8 O'clock. Isn't it Tell me where's Vilas? Come on, tell me. Why are you messing up with me? Tell me. Tell me where's Vilas? Do you want to get thrashed like this? Hey, you'll die. Tell us where is Vilas? Don't waste my time. Tell me where Vilas is. Tell me! Where is Vilas? He just keeps staring like a fool. Tell us! Tell us. Come on, tell us. Tell us! This is our locality. It's our area! It's our lane and you want to bully us? Is this right? Tell me! Hey don't beat him. He's badly hurt. Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell me. - I don't know where Vilas is. If I knew, I'd tell you. You take us to be fools? You think you are very smart to have come alone in our area? What are you all doing? Inquiring like the police? Why is he still alive? - To know what's on his mind. Forget what's on his mind! Make him speak! If anything happens to me, Prafulbhai will not spare you. He will burn down your whole area. Shut-up! - Why are you beating me! You threaten me with Prafulbhai's name? You are threatening Ramanbhai? Prafulbhai will not spare you! Make him shut up. He's gone nuts. Patankar has come. Have you gone nuts? Will you shut up? - Prafulbhai will not spare you. Do you want to live or not? Make him shut up! I'd told you to shut up! Patankar has come. Is it confirmed news? - He's your man, you know better. That's the word on the street. How much has he betrayed me for? I've heard, for a million. One million? Where is he right now? - Hotel Sea View. Room 14. Hurry up, we are getting late. You go ahead, I'll follow. Scared to come along? He's sweating. Scared, are you? My new shoe is biting me. It's not fear, it's something else. Why, you are an old hand. It's not the first time you are killing a friend. Vilas is our friend. Until yesterday, he was in our gang killing people with us. Today, we are going to kill him. Naturally, I am tense. Do one thing, you stay here. That means, if I go against the gang even I'll meet the same fate? Don't talk like kids. You know the answer. Let's go. My boy, you don't have that killer instinct. Why do you say that, sir? - You look very nervous. What is the matter? - Nothing, sir. No? Your wife will come from here... ...and over there, Malvika will sing. You misunderstand, sir. I have no such relationship with her. Is it? Couldn't you have waited for me? - "You be quiet." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet." "Let our silences carry out a conversation." "Let our lives carry out a conversation." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet." "Let our silences carry out a conversation." "Let our lives carry out a conversation." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet. "You be quiet." "Let's drown in each other's eyes. Let the hands converse." "Let's drown in each other's eyes. Let the hands converse." "Holding you in my arms, this night will pass like a wind." "Let our fingers carry out a conversation." "Let seasons converse with the blossoms." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet. You be quiet." "Let our lips meet and produce wordless melodies." "Let our lips meet and produce wordless melodies." "The melody of our love will echo from the earth to the sky." "Let our passion carry out a conversation." "Let our love carry out a conversation." "You be quiet, I'll be quiet." You be quiet, I'll be quiet." "You be quiet, I'll... - Be quiet." "You be quiet." This is Vilasbhai here. I told you to shift me to another room. So what happened? Alright, do one thing. Send someone else here. And shift me to his room. You understand? If anyone asks for me, don't tell him I am here. I am not here! You understand? Why are you so worried? No one knows you are here. Sit down. Marathe, what happened about my ticket? You cannot arrange two tickets? If you cannot arrange plane tickets, arrange train tickets for me. Hurry! Look, if Ramanbhai comes, speak calmly with him. Explain to him that Prafulbhai trapped you. Oh yes! As if I will explain and Raman will believe me. Raman refuses to understand anything. Boss. You all stay here. Boss, don't go in alone. Boss asked you all to stay out. Vilas... So the news was right. I'd heard the right news. You took one million. You took one million rupees to kill Ramanbhai. The news was true. The news was true. Raman, don't move, I'll shoot! I swear I'll shoot! Go ahead, shoot! Look Raman. - Shoot your Ramanbhai! Kill the Ramanbhai... ...who went after your brother's killer to Calcutta and killed him. Kill him, because you forget all that for rupees one million. It is you who has forgotten Raman, not me. You've forgotten those days when we together looted rich Merchants. I always considered you my brother. Always! And you think I have betrayed you? Hey, don't come out! Of course you have betrayed me. Vilas, I saw your photo! You were drinking with Praful Kalia. Does that mean I have joined hands with him? Shobha! Sister-in-law, lock yourself in. I think we will have to go in. Ramanbhai is taking very long. Since you were not even born... ...Ramanbhai has been doing this several times. So don't try to act like a stooge. Hey, who are you calling a stooge? Did you call me a stooge? You called Iqbal a stooge? - No. Then he must have called you one. Ratna, open the door. Ratna, go out. Got the time to come finally? You are excellent! - Oh, really. Thank you. Angry? - No. I had come to say that if you like, tonight... At night? You don't have the guts to congratulate me in others presence. And at night... - Even Pooja was present there. How can I speak to you in her presence? How long will you hide it from her? She will know some day. - You don't worry about that. You will come at night? What will you tell Pooja? I love you. The door is open. The door... The door is open. Malvika... You! What the devil are you doing over here? I had just come to congratulate her. That was quite congratulation. And your wife is waiting outside for you. Keep the gun inside, moron! - Don't you dare! I'll call Praful Kalia. Just listen, don't speak. Pick up the phone. Hello. Praful Kalia here. You rogue! You want to trap me? You want to get me killed at Raman's hands? Now listen, Raman is dead. Now it's your turn. Vilas, I did you a favor by giving you an excuse to kill Raman. Now you're the boss of that area and we can work together now. You are right, you swine! Did you understand now? Did you understand now? He's going to shoot Boss! Irfan! I'd warned you not to come in! What? Boss, what have you done? What have you done! What have you done! What have you done! - Vilas! What have you done! Nothing will happen to her. What have you done! Call an ambulance! Listen, tell the manager that... Listen to me, Vilas. Listen to me, Vilas. - Move! Vilas! Hit him! Hit him! Aditya is a rogue and if you have even a little sense... ...you won't let him come near you. Are you listening or not? - No. You really are a fool. He is a married man. He is fooling you. And I am knowingly being fooled. Why do you bother? You mind your own business. Don't come crying to me later when he goes back to Pooja. Alright, I won't. You really are mad. His love has made you go crazy. Yes, it has, it's made us both crazy. You are nuts. Listen. Please. You'll get the money. Just manage things. The ambulance has come. - Is it here? Boss, the ambulance has come. Shankar. Lock Vilas in the godown. He's gone berserk... ...he'll kill anyone. Ask Iqbal to take her to Deshpande's clinic. And ask him to certify death by heart attack. Heart attack, get that! A certificate of heart attack. I don't want any more trouble. Meet me tomorrow morning. You idiot! I'd said he'll get us in trouble one day. Pooja, we were talking about you. What is the matter? You look upset. I wanted you to meet him. "What is life? Nobody knows." "What is life? Nobody knows." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "What is life?" "What is life? Nobody knows." What are you doing! Pooja, at least listen to me! Please! I want to talk to you. Shut-up. Just shut-up. Has someone said something to you? I'm sure someone has said something. Go out. Why? - I want to change. Then change. You slapped me in the party. Someone said something and you believed it? Believe me too. I'm sure Patel must have told you that I... Pooja, my job is such. I have to meet people. I have to meet girls. I have to entertain them. - In the bathroom. What nonsense are you talking! Have you gone mad? Pooja. Pooja, tell me what you heard. - Go and ask Malvika. Oh, the green room incident. So you meet her in the Green room, not the bathroom. I am not saying I don't know her. Believe me. I met her the first time when... - Stop it. You don't have to give me any explanations. I don't want to know... ...where you meet her, when you meet her... ...how many times you meet her. Once, or twice a week. Do me a favor. Please just get out. It's her call, isn't it? - Pooja. It was her call? Don't touch me. - It wasn't her call. Just get out of the house. - Listen to me. Listen to me. - Just leave... ...or I'll jump from the window! What nonsense are you talking! - Just get out of my house! This is my house too. - Then you live here. Leave me! I don't want to live here! Why don't you call her? I don't want to live here. - Shut up! Only then can we talk. Pooja, even I am human. Even I can make a mistake. Pooja, after all we are. Malvika... What do I say? - Pooja! - Mr. Aditya, what is this chaos about? Pooja. - These are Mumbai walls. They tremble even with a scream. Husband and wife fights are common in every home. Pooja, please! - But no one creates a scene like this. Look, I don't want to interfere... Who are you? - Who am I? Get lost! Pooja, please! I will complain in the building society's office. Pooja, open the door! Boss, it says this number does not exist. What number did you dial? Switch off the TV. Switch off the TV! Where is Chota? Chota! Chota! Go, Boss is calling you. You stooge! Who did you call a stooge? I respect Boss. If anyone else had said that, I'd have slapped him hard! But I cannot slap you. Why? What do I mean to you? You are my girlfriend. You don't have the guts to say that to Boss. I will even tell Boss one day. Better do it fast, There are many others in line. You shameless! Who is it? - Chotu. Go, my brother is calling you. I'll meet you later. You called me, Boss? Where were you? - I... Dial the godown number. I can't get it. Father, someone will go deaf here. If anyone will go deaf in the house, it will be me. You have any problem? Yes, the prayers are being offered there, the TV is on here. Do any one thing. The TV is on for me. And the prayers are being offered for your mom who's dead. Yes, Boss is here. Patankar's call. - Hold. Tell him, I'm going nuts. - I'll try he's right. He wants to meet you. - Call him here. Tell him I'll meet him at Shetty's bar. Get my shoes. Sit down. Patankar, Boss has asked you to come to Shetty's shop. When did you come? Today evening. Has he started some business? You'd told him you'll help him start a petrol pump. He has got into to habit of living off me. Look, I gave you a home to live. Your rations, your monthly expenses, I provide everything. Ask him to take a taxi permit and drive a taxi. You will like it if your sister's husband drives a taxi? Why? Why will I mind? I don't mind when my father keeps screaming at me all day. Then why will I mind if your husband drives a taxi? Explain to him that he should live off his own hard work... ...not live off others. Chota, let's go. "Hey, Sir!" "Hey, Sir! Hello, Sir! Sway and dance. Forget all your worries." "Forget them!" "Break the walls which keep you and me apart." "Break them." "All these sticks, bullets and fighting!" "To hell with all of it!" "All these sticks, bullets and fighting!" "To hell with all of it!" "Give love and win hearts, why create differences?" "Hey, Sir! Hello, Sir! Sway and dance. Forget all your worries." "Forget them!" Hello. - Wrong number. Chota, try the godown. Tell Tony we are coming. Is that Sajid with Ramesh? - Yes. Is he related to Kaderbhai? - Yes. "Life is like clay, you can shape it as you like." "You can shape it into a mirror, or you could shape it into a toy." "Don't fight, don't quarrel. A girl will love a boy." "As long as you and I exist, youth will be celebrated." "Why create a scene? Let our hearts unite." Say it's Ramanbhai's call. Okay. Dr. Deshpande is not available. A girl answered, said she doesn't know where he is. Pooja, please don't disconnect. Give me a chance to explain. I said I tried. All lines are busy. - Try again. Come on, try again. Hello. Pooja, please don't disconnect. I said I don't want to talk to you. I am coming home. - I'm going out. Where? - You don't have to worry. I am not alone. - Who is with you? None of your business. - Pooja, I'm coming home. I love you. Hey! Take your Romeo-Juliet talk somewhere else. Look, I want to make a call. Please! Don't give me that fine language. Move! Hey! - "Swing and dance." "Forget all your worries. Forget them!" "Break the walls which keep you and me apart." "Break, them." - How many times did I tell you... I am making a call and he is disturbing me. He's a strange man. Who are you people? What happened? What happened? What happened, Boss? Tell me what happened! What kind of bullying is going on? What did he do, Boss? Who are you? Get the car out soon. What are you doing! What? - Who are you messing with? - I'm not messing with anyone. The one you are messing with is Ramanbhai! So what if he is Ramanbhai? - Don't you read the papers? He's 'The' Raman! Slip away! Get him, Boss! Run away! Run away! Catch him! Hey wait, you! Hurry up. No one will leave this place! Boss, bye. Boss, we will have to kill that hero. Or we'll become a laughing stock. No one will leave this place! No one! No one! Ganya, come here! Look! Hey, catch him! Hey, catch him! Ganya! Hey, catch him! I'll check behind, You go ahead and check. Okay, I'll do it. - Alright. He's not here either. Where did he go? Where did he go? - He's not here either. Did you see a guy with long hair? Have you seen him? - A longhaired fellow. Where did he go? - Just keep smoking, you idiots! Where did he go? - Where did he go? Where did he go? Look, you'll inform the boss. No, no, you'll tell him. - Why these shoes? Throw those shoes! - They are new. You're carrying them in hands. Listen, Tony! Vilas, what are you doing? Look, you won't be able to escape... ...and I'll unnecessarily have to shoot. - You'll shoot me? You'll fire at Vilas? You have become Raman's dog. Go and lick his feet! If you have any goodness left in you, release me! I cannot release you. Who brought you in this gang? Who? Tell me who had brought you? I understand Vilas, but even I am doing a job. You used to visit my house, and tell me to marry Shobha. When she died, you didn't shed a tear, you didn't say a word. You're misunderstanding. You say Shobha is dead. But Shobha is not dead. Iqbal has taken her to the hospital. Look, I beg of you, release me. Release me, you thug! I cannot release you. If I do, Raman will kill me. I don't know what Raman will do with you... ...but I won't spare him! Tony! Hey Tony! Careful. - Sorry. Excuse me, sorry. You took so long. - Hurry up! Come on, take it out quickly. Manage this case. - Don't worry. Don't worry at all. We are there. Take her. - I'll arrange things. Boss has asked to certify death by heart attack. I cannot do just anything. Whether by accident or heart attack, why do you bother? Go and sit there. - But Boss wants it that way. Hello? Tony. - Yes, Iqbal? Tell Boss Shobha's death certificate will be arranged. What! - She had died in the hotel itself. Tony, what happened? Tell me what happened. Tell me what happened. Yes, tell me. Why are you quiet? Tell me! Whose call was that? Has something happened? Where are you going? Listen to me! Tony! Tony, tell me what happened. Tell me! Tony, tell me what happened. Tell me! Take this, and leave. But what has happened? I said take this and leave! - But what has happened? Why don't you understand? She has died in the hospital. Go! Just go! Tony, don't worry. I will not spare Raman now. Don't worry at all... ...nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to you! Please answer the phone. Rajesh, Aditya here. I am in trouble. - I know Malvika is here. Oh no! I'll handle her... ...you just come here immediately. - I don't understand. You won't understand over the phone even if I explain. Just come, please! This is too much! If you have a problem, you come here. You can't expect me to come so late. Rajesh, please help me. Look... - I am in deep trouble. These people will kill me, they have weapons. Just come! - Tell me where. If Shetty doesn't come within minutes, I'll break your bar! I called his residence. He has left, he'll be here any minute. If any of you know where that guy lives, tell me! Or I'll make you all stay here all night. Greetings, Boss. - Greetings, Boss. Kaderbhai has called a meeting of all dons. Kaderbhai has said Praful... - Did I ask you to sit? He has asked you to keep your boys in check... ...or suffer the consequences. I didn't say it, Kaderbhai has said it. Boss, leave him! - Leave me. He will do whatever I'll tell him do? We could not find him, Boss. But we'll find him, Boss. - We'll find him. We'll find him. Where is he? Where is Shetty? I want Shetty! You get that? I want Shetty! Rajesh, stop! Everything seems okay to me. Rajesh, listen to me! Let's get out of here! Just a minute. She wants to talk to you in private. I don't want to talk to anyone. Let's just get out of here. Malvika! - Stop her! Malvika, please. I am sorry. I am really sorry. I know you are angry with me. But I am in deep trouble. Get in the car, I'll explain everything. Please. I don't understand why we have come here. I used to come often to this bar. I have told Shetty many personal things about myself. Oh no. These people are still here. Please drop me off here. - How can you! How can you even think of leaving me? Because you are a rascal. - I am sorry. I said I am sorry. Why did you... I have apologized. - That doesn't mean I've forgiven you. Will you two stop fighting! Some people are coming out. Go. Follow them! - You want us dead? You should ask me to drive opposite. - All right. What if he has come to know my address? I'll call you. Drop me home. Please, Malvika. Follow them. Keep a distance. Keep a distance, don't go too close. I'm trying my best. You come and drive. Why did I go to that bar at all! Yes, why did you? You were supposed to come and meet me. There must have been a reason. - You always have an excuse. You treat me as if I'm your mistress. What nonsense! Have you gone mad? I'm always the last thing on your list. And that too if I'm lucky. I am suppose to keep waiting for you. How could I've met you tonight? Pooja has come to know about us. I wonder who told her. Maybe you did. You just say anything anywhere. Stop it! Rajesh, Stop the car! Adi, what are you doing! We'll lose their car. I am sorry. Really I am sorry. Explain to her. - You explain to her. I'm driving. Sorry, I didn't mean to say that, it just came out. I either drive or listen to you two, I cannot do both together. Hey, we've been here before. This is the same place I'd brought you the other day. When there was a party in your boss, Patel's house. They are going to Patel's house! Turn the car! Where are you taking this? - Inside, why? As if you are going to read inside. - Don't shout. This is the house, Boss. Guys, look! This is Patel special. Shammi kabab! As we say in advertising. Tasty and nutritious! Don't worry, I'll get it. Who are you? Keep the gun away. Patel? Yes. In your company... What's his name? - Aditya. Some Aditya works in your company? Does Aditya work in your company or not? - Yes. What's his address? - Who are you people? You want to know? The whole market is closed. Should they have kept it open for us? We must call Patel before they reach him. I say everybody, meet my friends. Come. Come, come. Darling just look after my friends. Take care of them. Everybody have a nice time. Have enjoy yourself. Shankar Come with me. - Ganesh, go with him. Would you like to have a drink? Please change the music and have some Pink Floyd. If he doesn't give it, I'll kill him. Hey, don't get too excited. Great, isn't it? Their life, Boss. Ramanbhai, however hard we try... ...but this style, this respect... ...is not in our destiny. What to say? You keep such cheap things at home! You have such a rotten trolley in such a beautiful house. He just pushed a little and it fell down. Why are you staring now? Pick this up. Sit down all of you. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down, madam. Sit. A lot of people work in my company. It is not necessary that I have everyone's address. Look, Chote has not killed anyone. One slash and you will remember everything. Will you give the address or do I tell him to go ahead? He's a young guy, he can do anything. Drive fast! The Irani cafe to the right will be open. Drive fast! The knife did the job. How did you remember now? - It was written in my old diary. What does QQ stand for? It's the initials of my name. Good day. Qasim Qayyum Patel. Sounds powerful. Listen. - What is it? If you find Aditya, what will you do with him? It depends on Boss's mood, but I think he's going to die. Stop! I'll call Patel. - Get down. Aditya here, sir. Some goons are after me. If they come to you... - You're fired! Don't you dare come to office tomorrow! I never knew the kind of company you keep. Do you know what they did to me? Hello. You told them? - I told them everything! I told them about your mother, father, grandfather, everybody! They told me that they are going to kill you. Oh no. Hello. Pooja, Aditya here. Pooja! - Wrong number. Listen to me! - Shall we go? Let me finish my drink. Come what may, don't open the door. Pooja, listen! Oh, no! Patel told them everything. - Get in. Hurry, Pooja is alone at home. Why are you staring? Go away! "The soil smiles and spreads fragrance through flowers." "The soil smiles and spreads fragrance through flowers." "It's the soil that turns into the iron of a sword and sheds blood." "The same soil changes forms in you and me." "Whoever knows it, repents." "What is life? Nobody knows." Lost your wife? Even I lost my wife. She died of burns. I didn't burn her. She left behind a suicide note. 'I am the only one responsible for my death'. She looked quite young. Did she meet with an accident? Then? Someone killed her? She was shot dead. Come, I'll drop you in my car. You'll feel better once you are out of here. Come. "Lord Shiva says, listen to me, friend, don't leave now." "Who cares if he is a king?" Pooja. Pooja, where are you? Pooja. Wait a minute Malvika. Where are you going? - I am going to house. How can you go alone so late in the night? Get in the car, I'll drop you. - Have you gone mad? Aditya has gone up to get Pooja. - So what? He will go, her life is in danger. She is his wife after all. - And who am I? You well not his wife. Exactly! I am not his wife. She will come here any minute. I don't want to create another scene here. Please let me go. I'll take a cab. - O God! I don't think you can go now. Get in the car. Open the gate. - Where have you come from? What do you want? - I want to meet Mr. Aditya. We have to give him a parcel. Pooja, I was here... Hey! What are you doing? I have some problem with the engine. I'm fixing it. Any problem... You're disturbing people's sleep. Sell it as junk. She's your wife? Go, take a taxi! Get out. I think it will be better if we are not seen here for some time. Get in. Who'll go in first? Me? - Yes scared? Go! There is no one here. The field is clear. Quite an expensively done up place. - Yes. What a house! We must tell Ramanbhai to buy us such a flat. Consider this your own home. Take it over. How can I? Is there no law and order in this city. Where is the law? Didn't we barge in? What beep is this? - Is it the washing machine? Is it the telephone? Every beep for you's of the telephone. Didn't I tell you it was the phone? That beep was a signal. This is 367984. Please leave a message after the long beep. Aditya, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. I know you are there. Anyway, I am in Naaz restaurant. I am with KC. I will come home with him tonight. Don't be at home. What did she say? - Play it again. She seems to be our hero's wife. It was her voice on the phone. She's a flirt. She's roaming around with another guy. Our Ramanbhai is after her husband and she is after another man. Tell me something. If our wives were to say this would we have tolerated it? My wife says that sometimes when she is angry. So do you tolerate it? - I slap her hard. Aziz, how come you are here? - Kaderbhai is inside. He's not well, yet he's come to meet you. We had a hard time finding you. What happened? Not feeling well? What are you doing? Have you gone mad? I don't understand. - Sit down. Praful Kalia had come to me. He wants a compromise with you. He cheated me, Bhai. He created a rift between me and Vilas. What is done is done. Now work together. It's very difficult. - Praful is ready to apologize. But I am not ready to forgive him. Sir, you please don't interfere. The other dons are also ready to join hands with you. Even the police is fed up of you. You will get killed in an encounter one day. You will keep your honour... Don't teach me how honour is kept. Right now, if I pump bullets into you... ...I'll become the don of the underworld. Don't interfere in this matter. Stop acting stupid. You got slapped in the hotel today. Tomorrow you may get killed at some crazy man's hands. I don't care. What did he say? - He was talking of a compromise. What's taking them so long? Salim, you stay here. I'll inform Boss of developments. We can get our hero through his wife. You stay here. - And shoot carefully. Aim his legs, don't blow off his brains. Remember you had blown off Gaikwad's brains? Go now! What have I done to you? Why are you all after me? "Whether we make enemies." "Or fall in love with someone." "As long as we live, we'll need a companion." "Whether we make enemies or we fall in love." "As long as we live, we'll need a companion." "Whether we make enemies." "Or fall in love with someone." - If you like, you can go to my house. We'll join you soon. Pooja, you don't want to talk to me. You don't want to dance with me. Then why have I come with you? Because I have brought you along. - Why? Because I trust you, - Then tell me what happened. How can I? Okay. All right. - Just go, please. Just go, please "Any excuse! Any saga!" "Keep it a secret." "Any excuse! Any saga!" "Keep it a secret." "Preserve your dreams as long as you can." "If you don't have a companion it will be disastrous." "Whether we make enemies or we fall in love." "As long as we live, we'll need a companion." Follow him. Hey, there he is! Drive! Get the car out quick! Move it! Faster, faster! Don't be afraid. Drive! Ask him to move. Hey, let us pass! Faster! Hey fatso! Move! Move ahead. Move! Move! No one will shoot! I want him alive! You! Careful! Boss. Boss! Where is he Boss? - Are you alright? Do you want to go to the hospital? Are you alright? You remember where the hero lives? Let's go, we have to go there. How will you kill Raman? I don't know. Why are you asking me this again and again? I will kill him. What business are you into? - I work in an office. Now leave, why are you stuck with me? Leave, or you may get killed. Where will I go now? My wife is... - Keep quiet! Praful has come. I've come. Have you brought it? What are you saying, brother Vilas? What are you saying? Once I give my word, I keep it. I've brought it. - Where is it? You still think I am cheating you? Whatever happened earlier was due to my old enmity with Raman. If I had any enmity with you, would I come here to meet you? You would have. You are going to gain more from it. What gain? If I wanted, I could have refused. Keep it. Don't show me money. You are out to kill Raman. I won't take money from you. The gun was just an excuse. I've come to make you an offer. If you like, we can work together. I don't work with pimps. You gave me the gun today... ...our deal is over. No one has done anyone a favor. - Hey! Enough! No one has spoken to Praful like that until today. I regret your wife's death. - Me too. Come in. - No Pooja, I'm leaving. Come on! He's inside. I really should go. - Why? Aditya... - Sit down, this is my house too. I'll get you a drink. Take it. - Thank you. What is the matter? What happened? What happened, Pooja? Don't you understand? He is having an affair. Go call him. I want to finalize everything in your presence. Go and call him. - Alright, I'll call him. I'll call him now. Aditya Pooja, he's not here. Aditya, what's going on? Don't create a scene. Stop it! Don't shout! Help! Please help. Mr. Verma! Open the door! Mr. Verma, don't open the door. I'm going to call the police. Don't open the door at all! You understand, please. Oh, so the husband is inside, and the police is coming. Yes! Get him arrested. The everyday nuisance will be over. Who are you? Who are you? No one is answering the phone. We'll wait for some more time. If Pooja doesn't call, I'll go. What's his name? What did you say his name was? What are you doing? Your friend, whose father is the police commissioner. What's his number? - 6295611. What are you planning to do? - We must inform the police. You want us dead? They'll come to know where we are. Ramanbhai will have contacts in the police department. So what do I do? Look Aditya... I think for a few days you should get out of this city. He is right! We'll go to some other city for a few days. I cannot leave Pooja and go anywhere. I cannot. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Friends, for our building society's party we have invited some special guests. We present, the Sea Green Party! Whoever he was, he asked me Aditya's address... ...and I gave it to him. Where he went after that, how do I know? I wanted to give him a message. That's why I am looking for him. I'm hanging up now. Yes, please hang up. Look Vilas, my job is done. I gave you Patel's number. Patel has given the boy's address too. My job is done. Don't involve me into this problem anymore. Look, ask this man to drop the gun. Shetty, be careful. He's crazy. If he pulls the trigger, you'll be jumping like mad. Your maid will have a problem cleaning up your brains. Let's go. Come. Come. Now what? He says you are a low life. You will inform Raman after I leave. So you must be killed. He's crazy! He's only talking of killing. Where have you brought him from? Why will I inform Raman? I want to do business here. I haven't come here to carry tales from here to there. See, wait a minute. Okay? I disconnected all lines. Where will I call from now? Here, take this key. This is the key to my house. Here! Take it! Take it, Vilas. This is the key to that room. Lock me in the room... ...like you have locked up my family. Vilasbhai, do you understand what I am saying? Vilasbhai, you are in this business since very long. Even I can be of use to you. Just think. I could be useful. Vilasbhai, what are you thinking? What are you planning to do? What are you planning to do? Lock him in the room. What did you do? - He was trying to run away. I fired, and he died! Are you out of your mind? - I was helping you. He is at Rajesh Chopra's apartment in Lokhandwala. Sea Green Apartment. I don't know anything else. I'll get you injected. So late in the night? - Yes. We will get it done tomorrow. I told you what I knew. If you want, you may take my money... ...but please let me go. Do you consider us to be beggars? No! - Keep it. You are a scoundrel. Salim said that you were trying to woo hero's wife. Extra marital affairs are common in your society, isn't it? No, I mean yes at times. It's the same as there's murder in your society. You feel like cracking a joke? Chotu. Let's go. Let's go. You rascal. How dare you abuse us? You are abusing us? - No, I didn't. I got scared, so... - Darn you! Sit down. What's going on here? How did you enter? Who are you? We are decent people. Look at your faces. Who let you in? Watchman! Where is Pooja? She is sleeping. You too go and sleep. Greetings, Boss. What happened? I looked everywhere but could not find Praful Kalia. Where is your uniform? I'm not on duty now. Don't wear it even when you are. Of what use is your being in the police force to me? I told you to find one Praful Kalia, but you could not. Don't say that, Boss. I did try hard. What did you try? You are lying to me? You think I don't know what you were doing? You were in the police station distributing your bribe money. Tried indeed! Straighten yourself! We have to take him to the hospital. He's hurt. - Take him in a taxi. Hey! What did you say? Is it beneath you to take Chota to the hospital? It's not that... Look, you advise too much these days. Keep your advice to yourself. Clear? Go with Patankar. - No Boss. Patankar... Boss, take care. - Get in! Hurry up please, quickly come with me. Take the jeep out, I'm coming. Why did you have to tell them? - What else could I do? Couldn't you have lied to them? - What do you expect of me? What do you want from me? - Oh shut up! You are too much! Enough! - Get lost. K.C What happened? - His wife has complained to the police. So? - All inspectors are not like me. This inspector is very tough. He'll arrest Ramanbhai. Let's tell Boss, hurry! Come on. Pooja! They have come to know where we are. Run! Come. Hurry up! Pooja has left for coming here. We'll pick her up downstairs. "The first time when we met." "The first time when we met." "The first time when we met." "The news spread far and wide." "You were the heart-throb of millions." "And I was one in a million." "You were the heart-throb of millions." "And I was one in a million." "You would shower your love on me." "We never remained apart for a moment." "Everyday we'd talk secretly in sign language." "When we met the second time." "When we met the second time." "I came with a marriage proposal."

"The personal discord reached the courts." "We repent getting married." "We just destroyed ourselves." "Our happiness just turned into flames of alienation." Who fired? - The hero must have fired. On the terrace! Catch him! Catch him! Stop. Vilas! Nothing happened, Boss. You worked for Ramanbhai until yesterday. What happened now? How come Ramanbhai and Vilasbhai have become enemies? Tell me what happened. - Don't you know what happened? I know a little... ...but you lost your chance. You killed a kid? - Yes, so what will you do? Tell. I will bring two dons together. But one will be a corpse. And it will be yours. Then shoot and kill me. Shoot Bansi, shoot! Fire! Bansi fire! Come on shoot. Hey! Give that to me! Leave! Stupid fellow, First you release the safety. Hurry up! - Take him in. Hurry up! - Be careful. Go quickly, We will follow you. How can you even think I will go to her house? We have no other option. Malvika lives right behind this building. No one will know we are here. - Why, didn't you come here often? Have you gone mad? Pooja, can you forget your marriage problem for some time? Our lives are in danger. - Explain to her! Call Dr. Deshpande. Chote, wake up. Chote, wake up. What are you waiting for? Fire the shot and kill me! Come on kill me. And go and take your charity from Raman. Show him your dog like loyalty. Kill me! I can do even that, Vilas. I can do that. Inspector Patankar held a famous underworld don captive in a building. Despite warning, Vilas fired at Patankar. To save his life Patankar fired a shot which claimed Vilas's life. This can be one story, Vilas. And what is the other story? Keep your eyes open. You are alive, nothing will happen to you. Open your eyes nothing is going to happen to you. Why isn't anybody here? Where is Deshpande? Chote! - Keep moving. Chote! Come! Hurry! Hurry up, doctor. - Where were you? Attend to him. Make him alright. - Chote. Nothing has happened to him. I don't want any bad news. I don't want any bad news. Nothing has happened to him. He is like my son. Damn! - Why are you crying? Tell him to stop crying. He's gone crazy. "What is life? Nobody knows." "What is life? Nobody knows." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "Whoever knows it, repents." "What is life?" "What is life, nobody knows." I have packed something for you to eat. Will you have tea? - No thank You. You can take some of my clothes if you like. Calcutta is very far, you may need new clothes. No, I'll buy new ones. - Sorry. Pooja. Don't be rude. She is right. At such a late hour... Malvika, pack a few clothes for her. Pooja, you are too much! Please tell me, do you love him? Tell me, do you love him? Tell me. Please, tell me. Want to know the truth? No. You are lying. Everyone is lying. "Our names are new." "Our names are new." "But the pain is old." "This pain is old." "Our names are new." "Our names are new." "But the pain is old." "What is life? It is lighting a lamp among swift winds."

Can't I come? - I won't be here. Where are you going? - None of your business. She's there waiting for you. Don't think I was just fooling around with you. I love you. - Get out! "Which land is the land of sorrows?" "No value for tears." "Which land is the land of sorrows?" "No value for tears." "Everyone is a stranger to me." "Everyone is a stranger to me." "No one will help anyone here." "Everyone has to deal with his own pain." "Our names are new." "But the pain is old." "What is life? It is lighting a lamp among swift winds." "Our names are new." "Our names are new." He loved my sister very much. He thought I didn't know. They met secretly. I thought when the time was right. I'd get them married in a 5-star hotel. I had nobody else. Whatever I had would've belonged to him. Don't cry. Don't cry, it's no use. He's gone. Take him away. Malvika! You are going somewhere? - Yes. Where? To my sister in Paris. Malvika, don't go. What is left for me here? Malvika please... - I can't live here, Rajesh. Everything here reminds me of Aditya. Forget that lowlife! What are you saying, Rajesh? He is your friend. No, he's not my friend. I am his friend, but he is not my friend. I love him. But he doesn't love you. He has left with his wife, leaving you behind. Look Malvika... I never said anything to you, until today. I used to go away, leaving you two alone in my flat. But... - Don't say it. Don't say that you love me. But. It is true that I always loved you. I never told you this until today. But today when that lowlife did this act. Stop your nonsense! I don't love you, I love Aditya. Get out of here! Wherever you are, be happy. Stop crying. Stop it! I want that hero. I want him dead. Boss, that fatso is hero's friend. It looks like him. - It's him! Wait a minute! Where is that hero? - He's not here. Leave him! I have come to tell you where he is. Why have you walked... ...to your death? You want to know where Aditya is? I can tell you. I will tell them I had to speak because you beat me a lot. "No relationship is stable." "I've seen every kind of affiliation." "In the hands of indefinite time..." "In the hands of indefinite time every life is a toy." "Everyone has to repay the debt of life." I'll look for the ticket checker, you stay here. You won't go to Calcutta. I said that you will not go to Calcutta. What do you mean? I will go alone. Look, you... - If I am with you right now... ...it doesn't mean I've forgiven you. What nonsense are you talking! We can discuss this later. Do you know what you did to me? After tonight, everything has changed. I want time. Alright, I'll arrange your ticket. Ticket checker, excuse me! Listen! I need you, listen! Listen to me, please. Aditya! Aditya! They're taking my husband... Rajesh, you? How come you are here? I had to tell them. They threatened to kill me. What do you expect? That I'd sacrifice my life for that rogue? See what he did to you. And even Malvika... Even you should leave him. What is it? Whose compromise have you come for now? No compromise will take place here now, Raman. I've come to kill you, you swine! Shut up you fools. Stay inside! I'll kill you if you move! You killed my Chota. Right, rascal! But you survived. You understood now who the bullet was for? You killed Chota! Get out! Get out! Vilas... - Patankar, get his gun. Get his gun! Don't move! - Are you nuts? Come on! - I'm giving. Go and stand there. Search him. - Take out! Take out the weapon. Ganya! What are you doing, Ganesh! You!! Now tell me. Come on get up. Get up! Get up! Leave, or your family will go hungry. Or do you want to die a loyal dog's death? Or bullets will be wasted. We are leaving! Leave! But what about him? If he survives, he will not spare us. That's my guarantee. He will not survive. Shankar, Ganesh, Meet me tomorrow. Why do you care who Rajesh is? I told you he told me one of their men must be in hospital. There is he. That's him! What are you doing? What are you doing, Vilas? Have you gone mad? You are right. I have gone mad. You forgot everything. - I haven't forgotten, Raman. You have forgotten. What did I forget? - You killed Shobha. Vilas, that was just an accident. Even this is an accident. Vilas... ...you forgot our friendship of so many years... ...and joined hands with him? The one who told me you are Praful Kalia's man? The one who told me you accepted one million rupees to betray me? You are lying. - No, I am not lying. He told me in which hotel you are. That is why I came there, and that's why Shobha died. Shut-up! Shut-up! I swear by Chote, I am not lying. He created a rift between us. You have to kill him. Kill him. Hey Vilas. Patankar! Hey Patankar, Vilas pull out your gun. You dog! You will die a dog's death! You are right. Vilas! It will make a very good news item in tomorrow's papers. Two dons kill each other in a gang war. You dog! Patankar! I won't spare you! Is anyone around? Is anyone around? Is anyone around? Is anyone around? Someone release me! Release me come on. Release me. Untie me! Untie me! Release me, what are you staring at me for? The train is coming. Release me! Release me! Untie me! Untie me! Untie me! The great Ramanbhai! Scared, aren't you? Where is your bravery? Hero. Hero, release me. Release me, you ruffian! - Don't shout! One more train will come. This time, it'll come on this track. How much money will you make through your advertising? One lakh, two lakhs, three lakhs? I'll give you ten million. Release me. I slapped you... ...won't you take revenge? Forget all that. I have forgiven you. I apologize to you. - Won't you kill me? All night, you were after my life. Now you're begging me for your life. Hero, release me. Look, the train is coming. I'll die. Look, I have two sisters. Release me. They are dependent on me. Hey hero, I don't want to die! The train is coming! Release me! Release me! I don't want to die. Release me soon! Open it quickly. Quickly! Quickly! Help me up. Give me the gun. Another news will get published in the newspaper tomorrow. Along with Shankar and Ganesh... ...the police inspector's body. Hero, you can go. You saved my life. I have forgiven you. Go. Hey, what a despicable man you are! What did you say? - I said you are a despicable man! I made a mistake by releasing you. You should have died under the train. And your body ravaged by dogs! I was stupid to have released a despicable man like you. Hey! Apologize! Come on, apologize! You think... ...you saved my life for one million rupees... ...and so can say anything to me? Lick this! See, the train is coming. I'll shoot you right here. And you will die under this train. Apologize. - Shoot! I should have done this before. I should have confronted you. I did you a favor... ...I saved your life and you threaten me? Shoot! - Apologize! Apologize! - If you have the guts, shoot! Hey hero! Hey hero! Hey hero! "Man kills man." "Man creates bonds with man." "Why do things happen the way they do?" "No one can understand it." "Whoever knows it, repents. Repents." "What is life? Nobody knows." "What is life? Nobody knows." Mr. Aditya, what chaos did you create? I didn't sleep all of last night. This is a reputed building, not some slum. One bad fish dirties the whole pond. Do you get it? Wonder where you bring all those ruffians from. See! They just turn and leave. But I won't let this rest. I'll complain in the building society's office.
