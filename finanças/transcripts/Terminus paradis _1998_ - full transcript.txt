Comrade, if he enters the wood, we will lose him. Ok....and? Move it! Move it! Come on! I think we lost some men. The willows might hide them. No, it is them that drew back. Platoon, halt! Look, the helicopter! This time he can't get away. He's ours. Ok, we got him. What does he want? He's a hundred meters in front of us. Only a peasant shouldn't he be. He goes towards the bank. Is he firing? I can clearly see him... on my left. We got him! Order! He turned on the right side, towards the wood! We'll lose him! Go, hurry up! Watch out with that gun! The objective moves towards the wood. There are gendarmes in the wood. - What is he saying? - Something about gendarmes. Where do they come from? Which is their code? No idea. Not the same frequency. The objective got in the wood. We'll lose him! Platoon, deploy! Move it, you fucking idiot! There! There he is! Platoon, halt! Platoon, are you all deaf? Halt! The gendarmes emerged from the wood. They move towards you. Received? Shit! They are going to rub shoulders with each other! Army, pay attention! The gendarmes are coming over! On the ground! Don't you hear? On the ground! Mr. Colonel... He shot the Colonel. He fired on us. He shot the Colonel. Pay attention! Stop shooting! Everyone must stop shooting! Waste him! Good, we've finished. Returning to base. Don't shoot! At your orders! Lieutenant Oulea. I have two wounded persons, out of which one very badly. - How many? - Two. Me, also. Two wounded persons, also... and I don't even have a bandage. He looks as if the hail storm came upon him. Someone bring a tarpaulin here! He didn't use it. What are you saying? He didn't shoot. The gun muzzle is cold. Who fired, then? Fuck me! So, what's your problem? You wait in vain, he's not coming. Oh, really? Have you seen what time it is? So what do you suggest? Vodka. It's my best friend. So...what do you eat to keep you so pretty? This takes care of me. But the children don't drink, they suck. Would you like to know what the children suck? How old are you dear, since you want to... - What do you think? - 15 years old. Add some more! 16 years old. - Some more! - 22 years old. - Leave it lower! And what do you do? I'm a waitress at Gili's, in Dudesti. And you? Graduated from electronics. You damn hooligans! Ok, sweetie...I breed pigs. I breed pigs, I swear. It's well paid. Shit, I get to know only suckers and losers. Why didn't you tell me the elevator isn't working? Because we don't take the elevator, we go up with the horse. My head hurts like hell... We'll take it easy on the staircase. You can go with your horse on the staircase. I'm not going anywhere. I'm so stupid! And the guy with the "Dacia" stopped but I turned him down. Come on, sweetie... I told you I'm not going anywhere. My feet won't help me! I think my toes are wounded! You can even fuck me, still I won't go anywhere. Don't you think you have too much guts? What? Would you like me to scream and wake up all the people? If I kick the shit out of you you'll never forget me. Don't fucking play with me, got it? I've told you we take the horse here. Put me down a bit! I can walk by myself! You, stallion! I'm not tired at all. I'm a strong stallion. I can't wait to see you naked, stallion! So, what's your name? Norica, from Eleonora. Mitou, from Dimitrie. Tell me, Norica... Are you not afraid? Afraid of what? What if I take you upstairs to devour you? I could butcher and cut you to pieces. No one saw you entering here. You will be my food the whole winter, as you are dear to me. Your pussy and your brain, in the freezer! If that's the way it was meant to be... You killed me, Norica! Do you know a Japanese has been here before you? Oh, that was you, then? Yes, but no one believes me. It's ok... You're salted, it's good. You are right, it's good. Is there something left out of the... Out of the Japanese? Not much. I needed fresh meat. Are you still not afraid? Afraid of what? What if I let you fall? So what's the problem? Am I not your little bird? I'll fly a bit and come back on your shoulder. You are totally "syphilitic". We won't make a nest for a long period. You ogre, I will fall asleep and you're going to devour me. Is there something left to drink? Give me the jar! I feel like sleeping. What hour could it be? I have no clock. It is at the clockmaker. You don't have many things around here. Have you decided to repair all of them? At least you have a mattress. Yes, at least I have that. What the hell is her name? Did I fuck her or not? Good morning, chief! Morning! How do I look dressed like this? Did you wash your drawers? Take care not to catch a cold. Don't worry, chief! I'm not so weak. Give it to me! I'll cook some fried potatoes with eggs, we eat and then I go. Go where? Obviously at work, chief! What work? I'm a waitress at Gili's, in Dudesti. Oh, really, why do you need this Gili dude? Because I'm sick of hooligans. I can't believe...this Gili dude... He's a serious man, head of a family, leaves everything behind. We'll marry this autumn. With rings and everything. Or maybe you want to marry me? Oh, you're the type... ...who marries. So, is it a yes? Then we must find a place for you, sweet birdy! You'll find a shit! You're such a nice guy now, after you fucked me! Is this what your mother taught you? "Shit, chief, fuck"? I don't have a mother. Does your father know you're smoking? I don't have a father, chief. What about you? Can't it be seen I'm an orphan? I don't have a mother, nor a father, I don't even know my name. By the way, would you like to know my name? Of course I want. But if you didn't tell me until now, I couldn't afford to ask you. Do you want to make me kick your ass? I will ask your name, chief. One of these days, for sure. I can't wait to know with whom I messed up, who is the boss in bed and in the kitchen, also, who protects me from cold, gives me shoes and clothes and promised to find a place for me to live. I will cook something for you, chief. There is no flour, no semoule, no sugar, no rice...Nothing. What's this? I use it when I go to the opera. You old fuck! And this? It's nuts jam. I'm crazy about it. It's candied. I will fix it for you. You're fucking kidding me! Sauerkraut! And where do you keep the Japanese? Since you don't have a freezer... What Japanese? You forgot, chief! Leave some there. Tonight we cook force meat rolls in cabbage, with fish and sugar. Ok, chief. I'll go to work. My pigs are waiting for me. You stay right here and don't open the door to anyone. Especially if those from the electricity come. They ring and knock like stupids. We postpone them till Friday. Ok, chief! Stop calling me "chief"! My name is... Mitou... I know, from Dimitrie. You told me yesterday, but you forgot. I'm Norica... from Eleonora. But you also forgot it. The same with the Japanese. You have all forgotten. Do you remember I told you that you were syphilitic... or that we wouldn't make a nest for a long period... do you remember? You really scare me, Mitou! You silly man! Tell me... did you fuck me or not last night? Can you remember? no... I could not remember. This is what happens when you get drunk like a pig. But how else could I get drunk if not like a pig? There's no other animal so similar to the man than the pig. There's no other disgusting animal in this world than the pig. When the evil was driven away by God's Son out of the man, he hid among pigs. You really scare me, Mitou. All the animals are blind for a while when they are born, a few days or a few weeks. Only the pigs have a kind of cloth on their eyes, when they are born which disappears with the first sunray. Only them and the children start seeing so fast. Only the man and the pig are so impatient. They are possessed by a kind of devilish curiosity. They are eager to see the divine light. A pig is able of killing its brother for a pumpkin crust. The pig is the man's brother, Norica. These must be the idiots with the electricity. I won't open. Our little brother Nicusor is here! Our brother from America is here! Are you stupid or what? We wanted to make you a surprise, to have some fun. Get out of there! I couldn't help it. Are you going to come here or not? Laugh, Nicu! What are you doing here? I bought this from the airport in New York, seven dollars... We wanted this to be a surprise but this blockhead ruined everything. I couldn't help it. What are you doing here? I came to see you! Wait for me to wash, I smell of pigs. The same business? This is what father gave us: the pigs to me, America to you. - Orphan, ha? - Get lost. Give me a break! I came here for you, to forget about everything... Can't you forget it? You make the shit smell! To forget it, ha? Why not? Fuck it! To let bygones be bygones? Got it! Can't you once be "gallant"? Ok, if you say so. I've learned one thing from my pigs. The man descends from the pig not from the monkey. The pig is the man's brother. So may you live one thousand years! You were saying you're waiting for the citizenship before coming here. It will be easier for me to come when I have the citizenship. We will come there. You just be happy you escaped from this country. I will come with my wife, Norica. I took my chance. They could have turned me back. - Why should they turn you back? - Just like this. Stop it! Take it and go away, you get on my nerves! Listen... Are you going to tell us about it? Tell us about America. I've seen and passed through many things. What kind of things? Tell us what you've seen! We'll never have this chance. Leave him! He's too weak and scared to speak! Until he gets his citizenship, they will keep an eye on him. You stupid fuck! Get the hell out of here! You can play with the bottles here. Throw them on the cars one by one, ok? Don't tell anything 'till I'm back! What are you doing girls? Sit down, dear! Can you make some room, cousin? I want to wash. Pee, don't worry! Mitou is family! Don't you remember her, Mitou? She is Cristina. She won the bronze in Tokyo. Cristina, "wide opened legs", we all grew up together. Why are you dwarf, Cristina? If the Party filled us with testosterone.... And after separating from Florin and Nelu, I went to Hollywood. Have you really been to Hollywood? So I stayed a while around those artists' villas. I was so proud, thinking if those from my country knew where I was. If my family only saw where I was. I was rummaging through their garbages, looking for bread, bones... I was living eating from the garbages. And plumes, also. There were some huge and sweet plums like this... and oranges... - Oranges? Sure, it was the season. A lot of orchards. It was summer, it was so beautiful! I was such a good time... Don't tell me! You have been to Hollywood! Sure I was! Have you seen Ava Gardner's swabs in those garbages? Sure I did. Have you seen pools, also? Of course I did. I've seen many things around there. Despite this, sometimes you miss home. - Remember little Cocarlatu...George? - Yes... He cut his veins! He couldn't take it anymore! Why didn't he come home? Oh, my God, I forgot. Sorry! I forgot you can't tell anything... I forgot...Damn my muscles! Quickly, brothers! Help me! I need a nail to stick it in my head! Stop this bullshit! You have no audience! - Tell me, your brothers... - What's the matter with them? Totally out of their minds. And this midget with his wife... They love each other very much. She got her uterus sewn to have a baby! You idiot! Shut up and don't move from here! Don't you dare going anywhere! Understood? What happened, godmother? This idiot broke the windscreen of a car! - Well done. Why did he park in the street? - But where else? In the garage, like in America! Well done, boy! How did you do it? Go on! Teach him only rubbish! But he knew it already! Sit down! Nicu will tell us about America! Tell us, Nicu! How is it like in America? He won't tell us he lives a good life there. He's afraid we may come to him. I used an ultramodern procedure when they sewed my uterus. - Have you seen The Statue of Liberty? - Yes, I did. It's very high. How high is it? Stop that thing! Tell us, how high is it? As high as that block. In America, they have other methods for this problem with the uterus... Will you give me a break with your uterus's problem? You, tell everything! I've been living in New York for 3 years. I've had my ups and downs. Now I work in a restaurant for a Romanian, Leibovici. He lives near Arad. I wash the dishes in the kitchen. I wash the toilets too when required. A mountain of plates! I even dream about them at night! I have enough money. Last summer, I worked here and there, saved some money and I went to L.A., where I made a deal with Florin and Nelu. I would have stayed more with them but I needed money to come and see you. So, I went back to New York to earn money so that I can come here to you. Tell us, is it good or bad living there? Look... Say if it's better or worse than here. It's good everywhere if you obey and you mind your own business. Here or there, is the same. So, if it's good here, why did you leave? As long as you mind your own business is good everywhere. That is you must know your limits. It would be better to keep your mouth shut. Why keep it shut? Just like this. Or you must talk more about good things, only about good things... as they can hear you, here and there too, and at any moment they can... Get the fuck out of here! And you can suck my dick with your dandy tie! Who do you think you are to make fun of me? Look what a nice wife Dimitrie has got! So when will we dance at the wedding? Has the rice swelled in you, you losers? Marriage! Marriage! In autumn! Listen, Nicu... when do you get back in America? In autumn, too? No, tomorrow. Heard him, Norica? This mister is leaving tomorrow! Tomorrow!? He has been here for a month, no sign of life, he hasn't written a line in 5 years, has gone in America in my place, and now, he's going back tomorrow! Yes, tomorrow. You can come at the airport if you want! When did it arrive? I don't know. I've found it this morning near the door. What will we do? We'll go at the airport tomorrow to say good bye to the idiot. And after? After... I'll tell you what we do next: I'm going to Gili. I come with you. You are crazy. You'll say I'm your cousin. I tell you, you're totally insane. You didn't get it, did you? I'll be his wife this autumn. You should send this picture to Nicu in America. The little boy will be pleased to see it. Do you still take pictures? No, I'm not, father. - Don't you? - No. You are such a waste. Would you like to drive? I don't want to hit it. I'm not in the habit of driving anymore. At least if you liked driving. Better than nothing else. Look at your brother! He has got something. At least he is useful somehow. I don't have to worry about him anymore. ...Leibovici's plates... Sorry? Say it loud and clear if you have the guts! I didn't say anything, father. But you were nagging something. You can leave me and Norica at the end of the park. Were you not supposed to go to work? What hour do you start working? 2 P.M., isn't it? 3 P.M. I've started working at this hour for years and I've been telling you this for years now. He is old. We become boring and curious, we start forgetting. This is the problem with old aged persons. Even if you start at 3 P.M., you'll be late. It's 12.45 P.M. already. I'll be there in time! Why do you worry so much? I worry if I see you don't worry. Ok, let's start worrying! All of us, let's worry! What are you doing, Costel? Why don't you worry? Leave him alone. Tell me what's his fucking problem: "what hour do you start?" No one cries for me or for my salary there. People are not into pigs! I believe you! Oh, do you believe me? Ok, you're a major and vaccinated. I'm out of it... You're out of it, ha? Stop the car! Leave him drive! I said to stop the car! Leave him drive! Stop it! Are you insane? Do you want to kill us? Stop the car! Are you deaf? Stop it! You know I'm syphilitic! You idiot! You were about to kill us all! Do you remember when I made the request for a Visa? You came to me where I was, at the pigs. Remember, mother? I was 16 years old. After one year in jail. Don't worry! Norica must know everything! You started begging: "Retire your request or I'll be fucked up!" You know your father has tension! You'll kill him! Do you remember, father? I stayed there with my pigs so that you can come today and make fun of me. Shut up, it's my turn to talk now! And after the revolution who was sent to America using relations? Nicu, who after 5 years is still washing Leibovici's plates and toilets! Shut up, I'm talking! I'll disappear from your life! Starting from tomorrow, I'll be in the army for two years. Now, listen to me carefully! You've postponed my army for 4 years, though I never asked for it. I had enough of your relations. It's over, hear me? I'm going to army even if it's the hell there! That's what I want and I warn you if you ever use any relation again I kill you. Hear me, mom? I'll burn your house. And don't you dare send me any package or they'll end up at pigs! Come on, move it! Get off! - Get lost! Get lost! - You idiot! That's enough! Fuck you and your palsied family! From now on each will follow his own way! Three more beers. And don't stare at me so much or I'll pour them. - Are you going with me to a movie tonight? - You're kidding. There's a new Indian movie on. It'll make you cry. The Sandokan one? I've already seen it. No, that's a fight movie. This one's about love. Give me a break! What are you doing here? Will you stay with him all day? Bring her here, Gili, she forgot about our beers! These two are going to ruin me. What were you doing? Talking to that little boy? - Yes! - Oh! May our boss Gili live long! Cheers, Gili! May Gili Trandafir live long! Where is your old car? I let it breathe. We've suffocated together. Pour a beer to me, too! I'm melted. What are you doing? They are both new, taken from the streets. I must watch them. - Especially her. - Especially. What's wrong with you, Norica? She is so shy! Just a child! She knows what will happen this autumn... if she is a good girl. Mitu, my cousin. He must go to the army. What're you saying? There's my cousin, Mitu. He came to say good bye. He's going to the army. Come here! Good day! Norica told me about you uncle Gili... I'm her cousin. I came to say good bye before going to army. Sit down! Order a beer! Bring a beer for your cousin! - Two years? - Yes, two. Are you going to bring that beer? Add 5 grilled meat rolls, too! God bless you! God bless you, uncle Gili! God bless you! May you live one thousand years! And in autumn, the marriage! Good luck with Norica! Good luck, Norico! Shall I come and pick you up this night? - To pick you up... - What? I come to take you with my bike. Are you really so stupid? Why? It's not so far away. You really stink! You fucking bitch! Thanks a lot, uncle Gili! May God help you! Good luck! You can stay there and talk if you say you're leaving tomorrow. Who knows when you see each other again? Sit down, Norico! So, is it true you went to jail? Why? Rape attempt. A Japanese, too? No, she was from Giulesti. She gifted me some disease. And the syphilis? Later on? May you live, Gili! Good day to everybody! May you live uncle Gili and we next to you! I'm not giving anything without money! Come on...Only till Monday when I have the money. Norica give him a brandy! A vodka! And may you live long! Don't cross the line! It's much already! May God give you a car! He gave you a chick already! You were lucky! Luck is made with the hands! - May you fuck her 100 years from now! - Isn't it a bit too much ? How is she? She has a certain thing... I have never seen such a thing! Tell us, how is she? You syphilitic! Leave the canister! One, two, three, four! Form the group! Arrange three by three! He doesn't understand! He's new! He's new! He doesn't get a thing! Come on! What do they have? You're going in shit instead of them. They are the veterans. My brother told me this. They are so big! Mr. Corporal will we go inside? Shut your mouth and withdraw your paunch! Platoon! Halt! Arrange! Put out your cigarette! Show me what you've got! Understood! Lie down! Lie down! Are you deaf? Your private life is over. Listen to me carefully! Here, you're not in a pub! Here, you defend your country! Even if you want it or not! I will make men out of you! Stand up! I can't believe it! What's this? Tired, soldier? Mr. Lieutenant... Shut up! Come here! I can feel your wine flavour, you miserable! Look what he has here! Are you a faggot or a woman? Shut up! Did I allow you to laugh? Take it off or I'll take it off together with your ear. Got it? Lie down! Not you, him! Corporal, take over! Stand up! Lie down! Stand up! Lie down! Did I say "lie down"? I've brought some grilled meat rolls. I'm not touching Gili Trandafir's rolls. It's not about Gili, I stole them. Then I can accept them. Pay attention, there's a can of beer, too. It's not allowed. What's wrong with you? These assholes put some bromide in my food to make fun of me. It is said there're some who grill meat rolls out of human flesh. You are used to it, aren't you? So, you came to see me... Yes, why not? You fought for me, remember? Does he still touch you? Of course he does. It's his right. I will kill him. Why don't you talk to your father to get you out of here? I have no father, idiot. What about me? Must I wait for you for 2 years? You wait for me. Why should I? Because I want so. I'll get out of here when I want. You hurt me. Stay calm, Mitu! How are you doing here? I miss you like crazy. I've brought some nuts jam, your favourite. They love it, too! Can I? What if people see us? They won't see. Take them off! Are you alright? Take them off, hear me? Tonight Ex-Rock will be performing on the stadium. Are we going? I'm not allowed. I'm punished. Then I'll go with Marin, the boy from the grill. If you're going with him I'll break his head. But if you can't move from here... I'll manage to see you. Don't touch her! Shut up! Take your hands off her! Norica! Ex-Rock! Why do you always get me into troubles, Cafanu? Why? Tell me! Come...move it! Come on! Move it, move it, move it! The mask! Raise your weapon! Like this! You move slowly, soldier! I heard you breed pigs in your private life. This won't change. You stayed with pigs before, with pigs you'll stay from now on. Raise your weapon! Put the weapon above your head! What're you doing? Are you tired? Come on! Move it, move it! Stand up! Stand up! Don't you hear me? Keep the mask on your face! Like this! If you can get me in shit why couldn't I do the same to you? Back to your place! Mr. Colonel... I haven't seen you when you came. - Are there any problems with the soldiers? - Not at all. I was told something different. You didn't let him go home at all. He is punished. I went to take him from the police at night. And you put him with the pigs! I just took all the necessary measures. Following what regulations? You know we have had a misfortune in the unit before. It was an accident. Let me finish! Lieutenant... do you know how many of them are able to use a weapon here? Five per cent. Heard me? Five per cent. I wonder if you and me belong to this category. I want this soldier in my office, I'll take care of him. Cafanu is an irreconcilable element. And I give the orders in this unit! Listen to me! I knew his father, he was a kind of minister. Cafanu was 16 years old, he wanted to go to America. His father begged him not to leave: "You'll ruin my career." So, this loser didn't go, so that his father could be clean. Understood? Shall I bring some water? It's no problem. Good evening, Mr. Mitu! You can suck me! I thought it was the orderly officer. Come in! You got it all here! Look: bureau, phone, papers! Sit down! The world changed! You're somebody now! Let me offer you something to drink! It's 5 stars... Poor Colonel...I don't know why he keeps this since he's not allowed to drink. - Tell me, have you seen her? - Yes. - And? - And what? How is she? The Colonel will notice someone drank here. I've told you he's not drinking! I'll replace it with some tea. Same colour. Tell me! Put some bromide for his dick! Are you idiot? Tell me: how is she? I'll tell you, but I want a day off. You know how to do it. I have something but it's not written. The paper with the stamp is enough. I'll imitate the signature. Ok. Come on, tell me! - I'll tell you, but you won't like it. - Just tell me. - Don't tell me I didn't warn you! - Say it! Gili fucks her! Don't hit me or I scream! How can you know it, idiot? She moved with him. He doesn't hide fucking her, he fucks her in his bed. They'll marry. Do you think you're Gili? He has money. Fuck that bitch! Saturday, we go to Bica the Lame and fuck all night! Who fucks her puts his signature on her wooden leg! Stop thinking about that bitch! Wake up! Let her go! Mr. Colonel, let me go home, I have something to solve. You call me back one year from now. I promise I'll be here. Why don't you talk to your father? He can arrange this. You know he just waits for you to do this! I don't have any father. Mitu, I've been knowing you since you were a child. I think you take me for somebody else. Ok, if you say so... But it should be clear to you. I can't help you here. I can't let you go. Understood, Colonel. I said "naked"! Your pants off! Take off your pants, you idiot! Quickly! Stand up! To the left! What shall I tell you? Welcome here? You're welcomed in a bad place! This place is called The Snake Pit because they're so many. No one knows how they can live here. Let me introduce myself! I'm Burci, the Capitan, with one long dick to fuck you all! Patan! 18 months for desertion! Secasu! 30 months for killing a Corporal! Motoc! 6 months for stealing materials! You fucker! Dode! - 4 years for killing by imprudence! - Not my fault! I am talking here! - Cafanu! - Present! 30 months for indiscipline! You're such a loser! Margarit! Defecting with the weapon, 3 years! I'll fuck you! Cretan! Stealing from the unit's storehouse! You're fucked up! We are bad, aren't we? We are tattooed... Starting from tomorrow no long hair, rings, earrings, bullshits like these. Jerk off! Ilies! 18 months for hitting your superior! My fucking dick! You're the one? At your orders, Captain! Where do I know you from? How did you do it? Like this? Stand up! Come here, I said! I'm the Captain Burci. I've shot a soldier. A loser like this one... He didn't want to co-operate. He recognized to my face so I shot him! So I'm warning you in advance! What are you doing, idiots? Lieutenant Pricop says he doesn't need them now. Fucking assholes! Won't he need them later on? Isn't it right? - Yes, Captain. - Then... Then it means you must carry them back. Why are you back? I've already told you I don't need them. The commandant said to leave them here. You'll use them later. I'll call you when I need them. I don't need his materials now. Take them back! Didn't get it? I am talking to you! Do it! Attention! Move it! Ilies died. The fucking assholes killed him. Patan! Secasiu! Motoc! Berila! Ilies! I'll take the package for him. Are you idiot or what? Oh, I forgot about this. Do you have anything for me? Take this! Look, there's something for you, too! Words don't cost a thing. Mitu, listen to me carefully... and don't forget a word: Don't wait for me. I'll never come to see you again. I don't know where you are now and I don't even want to know. Don't you dare see me again with or without your tank! Gili doesn't want to marry me anymore "to leave his wife for a whore fucked by all the hooligans". He said he wanted a serious marriage. Me too. I want a marriage in the church. With a priest, and then I want a child... I would have liked a child from you but it was not possible, it was other way written. I told you we wouldn't stay long together. And that you were syphilitic, remember? Tell me! Why don't you say anything? You only love your pigs! You love animals not people! Kiss you, Norica. Stop! Mr. Lieutenant! If you don't stop, I shoot! I'll make a sieve out of you! Don't move! Hear me? - I'll shoot! - Go on, shoot! Leave me alone! - Give me the weapon! - It's mine! Lieutenant! What is it, cousin? Did you come to take her with the tank again? You're going to rot in jail! Suck it, asshole, suck it! Idiots! Only a band of idiots! - How many shots? - Five. - 7 mm? - Yes. Shithead! He shot because he was scared. I've finished. Take him to a cold place. So what do you think, Colonel? Your little innocent man... My God...how can this be possible? Each effect has its cause. And we'll find him following the trail. Come on, let's lift him up! Put his arm inside, too. Don't touch his ring! I don't understand. I don't understand a thing. "Soldier Dumitru" This one has food for sure. Look: cheese, frankfurters in boxes... expensive salami. Want some? I die of hunger. His mother put olives also. Don't you want? There's no bread but we have biscuits. Even if it's not touched you can get 3 days arrest for this one. Want to drink? No? Much better. What a garbage! And it's warm! Are you not thirsty? If you really want to know... I don't want to know a shit! Nothing! You could have sent at least a package. What was I supposed to send? Nuts jam? We get off! Jump! Come on, jump! I can't. - Come on! - I can't! Let me kiss your hands father! Where do you come from? We come from everywhere. We're here to pray. The church ritual is over. We're here for something else: we marry. - Mitu! - I know what I do. We want everything to be rightly done. As the habit is. This habit is not just to be there. Now it's fast, people shouldn't marry. Then I need the papers of the marriage. And there's a fee for the Holly Church. I'll pay it. I'll pay everything. And you don't have the proper clothes. She should be in white. Have you been married before? No, I haven't. See it? How should I let you marry if she isn't dressed in white? Wait, father, I'll dress her up! Look, what a beautiful bride! She is beautiful, isn't she? With the crown, she'll be more beautiful! The crown is not the problem. But you need a godfather and a godmother. Who'll guide the bride to the altar? I will. And then I can die. My son, God... God'll understand! Somebody must understand! I understand him. Father, don't force me... Now, I understand. Forgive me, Mitu! Forgive me, Mitu because I ruined you! Forgive me, God! Father, do as he says or he can kill you! Why kill me? For me. As you wish, boy. You'll wear one of my shirts. We're here to marry servant Eleonora to servant Dimitrie. May it be God, Son and the Holly Spirit's will. Amen. Have mercy! I'll have my licence soon I swear! Stop talking shit! Take everything you want, just leave me alone, I have 6 kids at home to grow! If you put it like this... you can say it's a wedding ring. You're so serious! Let's have fun! May it bring luck to your girl! You never have enough! You miserable! All the people respect me! What're you saying? Now, all respect me! What? These people... You're crazy! What's this? It sounds like a bumble bee. You get off here. Your trip ends here! And you? Me, what? What did you expect? Mitu, don't say this! We can jump, we can run away... You can, you're not guilty. You'll tell them I forced you. What about you? I will manage better alone. Get up! We don't have much time! Keep the mouth organ! I'll find you. I always did. I'll look for you. Take care of you! If they ask you just tell them I forced you. Don't forget, ok? Come on, the train goes slower now! I'm staying. - Do you jump or I push you? - I'm staying with you. - Come on! - I want to stay with you! Come on, girl, go! I want to stay with you Mitu! I don't want to go! Fall down on your knees not to hurt yourself! Jump! One last word... No more words! Mitu, I didn't have my period. Go! Attention! This is a mission of the Internal Ministry. I talk to the engine drivers of the locomotive. Stop the engine and get off! I repeat: this is a mission of the Internal Ministry. Of the Internal Ministry! Cafanu! Are you there, Cafanu? Where are you, Cafanu? We're here. Are you there? There are 40 sharp shooters here. They are all specialized in killing people. Would you like to play hide and seek with them? You're totally wrong, Cafanu! I'm not a nobody, Cafanu! I'm not any of your low life friends to show me you're the hero! Everything is surrounded. Did you hear, Cafanu? The soldiers are everywhere, the game is over, you lost! Everything is over! Answer me, Cafanu! Drop your jokes. Throw your weapon... and get out with your hands on your head. It's your turn now. Excuse me? Go and divert his attention! I don't understand. You are his commander. You're the only one who knows him. At least this is what the regulations say. Tell him to throw his weapon till I don't kill him! That's why you've brought me here! You're his commander, he'll listen to you. Tell him he still has a chance, life is worth living, everything you want. Maybe is better if you go without a weapon. We won't stay here till morning, I hope! He is right in this wagon. Walk slowly so he can see your hands! One last thing... try not to stay in front of the window. Ok, Cafanu! Your Colonel, Vatasescu, is coming to you! He has something to say to you. Hear me, Cafanu? After all you've done, a Colonel is coming to talk to you. Ready? Try not to disappoint us, Cafanu! Can I come in? It's me, Vatasescu. Come in! I don't have any weapon. Come in! Do you have a light? I don't smoke anymore. The door, please! The door, yes... Please sit down! Vodka? I came here to ask for your gun. It won't help you anymore. It's not yours, someone is responsible for it. - If I give it to you, will you leave? - Of course. - Even those soldiers? - They, too. Fucking shit! I've never thought it'll end up like this! Yes, look at us... You really don't want some vodka? Ok, I'll drink with you. It burns! - You're not in the habit anymore. - My doctor won't let me... He also drinks! Don't visit him anymore! You're right. When you asked me to set you free, what did you want to say? You were talking about your "duty". Me? It's true! You cleaned my boots but I can't remember afterwards. "I can't do anything for you", you said. Yes, you're right to hate me now. I don't hate you. What kills me is maybe if we've talked then... You wanted something so badly! To marry. That was the problem. And? I'm married now. I never expected this! Good luck and may it last! Good luck, money and dead enemies! How could we clink if we have only one bottle? If I knew you're coming... You didn't expect me, ha? I didn't think about it... Did you think I would let you with that madman? The one who was shouting? "This is a mission of the Internal forces." "Fire!" Do you have a light? Are you insane? Go fuck yourself! One day, all these will disappear. All of them! What means "nothing"? I'm telling you! Carp won't be a major but "Mr. inspector". May he go to hell! There won't be any majors in police and no one will go in the army. Won't there be any soldiers? Yes, but they'll be paid. They'll come to the barrack like you go to work. And the Lieutenant won't get them in shit anymore? There'll be nothing written in their contract. The soldiers can shit on his contracts. And you? I don't care. I will retire. I will go fishing. Do you know how to fry fish? - Without doubt. - Have you been a cook also? Cook, waiter, pig raiser, soldier. Will you take me? Only if you know to cook fish. I'm not coming alone. That's right. Bring her, too! I will, believe me. - No problem. - Here she is! She's beautiful. How couldn't she be? She is my wife. This summer, we are going together to America, at my brother. Do you know what bird this is? It's a chaffinch, a blue bird. One night, when I was with the pigs a sow gave birth to 12 little pigs. They drove me crazy with their squeaks. You can't know why they're squeaking. Because of the hunger or the fear... You think the walls will fall down from their noise! So how could I calm them down? I used vodka! I got them drunk so I can sleep in peace. They sucked vodka instead of milk. Then... they fell asleep. Then it was silence. A silence like in the first day when only God's spirit moved above the waters. Then, I heard this bird. It was there a smell from the pigs that no one could breathe. What were you doing there, little bird? Have you ever seen it? I'm sorry about one thing: the boy from the snakes unit. A miserable just like me. He's in hospital, he'll be alright. I didn't want to kill him. I just wanted to take the gun. He was staying like this: "Stop there or I fire!" "I shoot!" "Go on, do it!' And I pulled his weapon. Get down! Mr. Colonel? Good morning! Can I help you? Leave the girls and get back to work! You get back to your hens! Is there a church? Yes, the white one, near those trees. After the hill. Wait a bit and my Iorgu will take you there! He has the same way towards the fair. Is it a fair today? Yes, like every Sunday. What about that fun park? Would you like try some there? No, I lived my life. I came to baptize my little baby. Isn't him a little too big? I didn't feel good until now and he was too little to travel. - Is there the same priest? - Yes, he is. Why did you come such a long way? Only I know why... Could you take me there? Iorgu! Come here, Iorgu! What will he be called? He'll have the same name as his father, Mitu Cafanu. - Did he use to play for Flamura? - No, he didn't. Was he not in the second division? Then why is this name so familiar to me? You've seen it in newspapers. Don't make jokes with me! I'll go on feet. You say it's not so far away... Iorgu...what is called... I have it just on my mind... Flamura! They played for the right side... There were two of them: Canafu and Vatasescu... This is it! I remember!
