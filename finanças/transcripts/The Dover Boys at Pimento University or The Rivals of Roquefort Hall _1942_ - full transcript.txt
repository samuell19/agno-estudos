Pimento University. Pimento U. Good old PU Pimento U, oh sweet P.U., thy fragrant odor scents the air. Pox on Yale, pooh-pooh Perdue, Pimento U, my college fair. Out and away, the most popular fellows a... er... Ahem. Out and away, the most popular fellows at old P.U. are the three Dover Boys. Tom, the fun-loving member of the trio, Dick, a serious lad of 18 summers, plus a winter in Florida, as seen in the Dover Boys at the Everglades, and... um... Larry, the youngest of the three jer-er, brothers. A GAY outing at the park has been planned by the merry trio, and they're off to fetch their fiance, Dainty Dora Standpipe, at Miss Cheddar's Female Academy close by. With their usual punctuality, the boys arrive at the appointed hour of 3. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! And are soon on their rollicking way. Forced to pass a certain public house, a tavern of unsavory repute, our young friends meet the distressing situation with their usual uncompromising moral fortitude. Little do they know that even now, within this very tavern, Dan Backslide, the former sneak of Roquefort Hall, coward, bully, cad, and thief, and archenemy of the Dover Boys, squanders his misspent life. Hark! The Dover Boys. Drat them! Double drat them! They are escorting Dora Standpipe. Dear, rich dora standpipe! How I love her (father's money)! Confound those dover boys! Oh, how I hate them! I hate Tom! I hate Dick! And I hate Larry! They drive me to drink! Confound them!... hiccough! Con!
