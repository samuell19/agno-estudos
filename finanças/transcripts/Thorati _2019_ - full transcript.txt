'Ramanathapuram District... Early 80's' We are nomadic shepherds. Our job is during the period between the cultivation and harvest. We set temporary pen for the goats... And make the land fertile with goats' feces. We keep moving from one place to another. Evenn now we are going to uncle Marudhappan's village for a living. Nallaiah's family would be awaiting. Have to take him before 'the village head' leaves. Have to meet 'The village head'. You can meet him at the cattle shed. Excuse me, sir. Welcome Marudhappa. - Greetings, sir... I was just thinking of you. Greetings, sir. I myself wanted to meet you. - Oh! The harvest is over. You can set up the pen in our land. Got it? Only after you are done with your work, I can spread the manure. Sir... ! Advance amount? - Not at all. He is Mr. Nallaiah. Greetings. - He is my distant relative. He is from Ramanathapuram district. The drought has driven them here. Is it raining cats and dogs here? It's just drizzling then and there. God has plans for everyone. Then you can set the pen tomorrow and proceed. Okay. - Also in the vacant place of the temple... You can ask him to build a hut. Hey!!! What's this? Focus on your job. We will take leave. - Thanks. Excuse me! - Yes, sir. You will begin the job with a 'Kidai choru', isn't it? Of course, sir. Let me join it as well. - Definitely. Oh God! My goodness. Thank God. The jamuns are making me go crazy. I have to punish my tongue. Even then I'm not sure of the results. This is to be blamed for everything. Once for all. Are you going on a long trip? Just to the market to buy groceries. Nallaiah is hosting 'Kidai Choru'. To buy the requisites for the feat. Stay cautious. Will be back soon. It's a custom here. Someone has marked it for them. Grab someother dung. Seems to be a hard working lad. Let's get our daughter married to him. I echo it. Greetings! - Who are you? What do you want? We are the nomadic shepherds currently staying in the neighboring village. I was informed that you are done with the harvesting. Before the next sow... If we setup a pen and fill the land with manure... Land's fertility will be enriched and the outcome will be doubled. Obviously you will earn as well. That should be the primary reason. Carry on. - Thanks. Have this, dude. Silver wrist chain. My petty contribution. See how smart I'm. A bag of rice. We have to be least bothered about the food for quite some time. Why are you staring at me? It's high quality seeraga samba rice. I tested it myself. Let him go. Why are you hitting him? Looks like fat lady's chain. Don't take the rice. Give it. I can't accept your offer. Don't take the rice. It's my rice. - I can't give it for your price. When he can't give it for your price why are you behind his back? Mind you business. He stole my rice. My rice... Why do you do such things? Please stop. The rogue stole my rice. If you can give me a lift, we can catch him. I will split his head into two. There he goes. Chase him down. What's it? Air check? It's sufficient. I don't get you. Leave me. Oh my God! You scoundrel. Are you a thief as well? I'm not sure of the reason. But food is what lures me first. Ignore him. He is a glutton. He's up with his calculations. - How much would it fare? Let's deviate the conversation. We have rice to eat and liquor to booze. Meat would be the best compliment. Do you know how much does meat cost? Do you have money? Crazy guy! When did we pay money to get meat? I have options for that as well. The guard is awake. He is standing. But you say he has fallen asleep. He is standing. but indeed he is asleep. I don't get it. It's the habit of the sheperd's community. He will pretend to be standing to deceive the onlookers. Someone has taught him. You keep moving. I'll join you shortly. Move. - I want to see how he sleeps while standing. He is sleeping while standing. Oh no! Run from here. Hey stop! Guys! Help me. Leave me. Leave him. Leave the goat, you muggers! Muggers? You deserve a rough lesson. Punch him... - Let me go. Move. Why are you pushing us away? Give me the goat. Seems you haven't learnt the lesson. Your limb needs to broken. It's my favourite. It's my pet, 'Chevalai' I'll replace it with another. Do you think we are fools? Are you trying a new trick as you couldn't defend it with your valor? I swear. I'll replace it. He is confusing. - Seldom trust him. Have to content with the same porridge today as well? Wait. Let me get you another goat. Are trying to trap us by gathering people? You got your goat. Now scoot. Many a slip between a cup and lip. One mustn't eat words. Please give me some time. He looks fat, As I said.. Pass it to me... You didn't trust me. We live by our words. You stole it for your food, isn't it? Have this. - What's it? Dry marinade. It tastes good. You are a good boy. We will come tomorrow as well. Let's go. Mutton gravy for dinner. We know about this Man now. Yes, we can't get him now. - Twelve.. Sir... Sir!! - Have some patience. The game has reached an interesting phase. Twelve... 2 fives. Sir... - Why are you being pesky? What do you want? - Payment for manuring. Payment? You sought me to let you set a pen. Why should you I pay? For setting a pen. - Why are you repeating the same? You came and rested for some days. You took all the things that you brought. Then why should I pay? - Please don't be so unreasonable. Setting up a pen is for the fecal manure. Your pay will not feed us through ages. It will help us feed for some days. - Fine. I will talk in your terms. You leave the faeces. What's the core cause of it? It's because the sheep consumed the plants and shrubs in my land. So where does the payment come in to picture? I heard people saying... You are a shrewd cheat. It turns out to be true. It's unfair to expect a man like you to judge our labor. I will assume that I have spread it for free for a needy. Excuse me. Irony doesn't suit people of low stature. Scoot. Don't imagine you working around here. Are you locking horns with the head? Dad! Got all the listed things? - Yes. Why do you need a unburnt pot? - I'll let you know. We commit to the job with the sun and moon as the witness. The land of the head who refused to pay us for the labor... should go barren to an extent that it's must even produce ruderals. It must stay so till he settles us our payment. I curse it to stay barren. Who is that? Catch him. Let me go. Bloody moron. Are you trying to curse us by planting a pot? I swear that I will bury you alive. Leave him. Don't beat him. There is a guard? He has slept. The guard has slept. Let's move. You are enough to steal a cow. Idiot. We are to steal just one cow. But there are many angry ones surrounding it. It's easy to transport a calf. But the requisite is a miking cow. It's bulky. How to move it? And they have delegated it to me alone. They have tied someone. Its the shepherd. Come here. Come here, I say. Come on. Who is he? Isn't he the shepherd? - Absolutely. Why is he been tied up? - Not sure. They are to be pitied. He is right. Let's go. Have this. Maaya! I felt like repaying our life saviors... so Exhibit the egg... Only then it will be sold. Don't hide it. - Okay How are you, mister? - Don't be sarcastic. I'm worried that rain has played a spoil sport. You are adding fuel to the fire. So you have imported this clown to entertain? I brought him from the town to work here. How does it bother you? Get your quota and leave. Get him two bottles. Take this. Come here. - What? Why does an dish washer need a coolers? Let him go. Why are you trolling him? You are the perfect fit for scare clown. Get lost. - Leave the place, I say. Who is he? You are giving away free booze and gifting money as well? They are muggers. They are a gang of three. It's an itinerary. He doesn't deserve enough to be feared. I will bring men from town and slit them. They are lunatics. They are the ones who made me to roam around the courts. What do you mean? As I refused them to give free booze... They poisoned the liquor. 10 to 15 people who consumed faced a near death situation... My God! What's cooking? Rice porridge. Can't you cook something spicy? Am I your wife to satisfy your taste buds? Have what's served. The shepherd. The same old story of dumb signs. Excuse me. Better. What brought you here? To meet you. We would have been dead by now had you not saved us. I want to repay the favour by serving you some tasty food. So I have brought this sheep. Is he really meaning it? - Cool. He wants to see us happy. We are orphans. They are drafting a bigger plan! Didn't you get it? - No. You will leave after serving us. What will happen after getting used to this tasty food? I will serve you for ever. Spicy food for lifetime! That won't work out. He is right. Take away the sheep. It can be worked out. Kins are the ones who help the ones in need. It means you are my kin. I truly mean it. Please... He has driven away the lucky mascot. Get lost, morons. Wanted to befriend you, but you are driving me away. Get lost, idiots. You... Don't lose him. Cover him up. I did it out of ignorance. Let me go. Spare me. He got scared. How is it? Candidness will stick us together. What made you come home before the dusk? My heart feels heavy. What happened? Like a male goat heads a flock of sheep. Similarly we have only a son to care of us. I'm scared that we might lose him. Come on. - I ran a thorn. He is going through a bad phase. So he befriended bad people. If we get him married... He will mend his ways. Pechi... This didn't strike me. Why did you slit it here? If you let the blood spill through the whole way... People will assume that some wild animal did it. You are smart enough even after getting high. What happened? You son had a pet 'Chevalai' right? A thief has slit its throat and taking it away. Go thrash the thief and get the lamb. The thief is none other than your son. He is abnormally drunk. Just follow the path. If you just roam randomly... I will thrash you all. I will go to Marudhappan's house. You are right. She will be the right choice for our son. Where are you going? Why are you halting around? What are you staring at? The only reason you are alive is that you increase the population. Else you will be slaughtered for the next festive season. Shoo! You have eaten enough. Hey girl! Who is it? Uncle, is it you? - Yes. How is aunt? She is fine. How are you? - Good. Where is your dad? - He is near the pen. What made you come here? I wanted to drive away 40 sheep from your flock. You are not ignorant to know that they can't be driven away just like that. It will be gifted to the one who will marry me. You sensed it. Have it, brother. Seems to be lost in thoughts. Not sure what he has in mind. Any trouble with the rearing? Do you want any sheep as loan? Disclose the thing that's running in your mind. I'm here to ask your daughter to marry my son. Yes or no. Be precise. Oh God! It had been a while since you came here. You were too hesitant to ask for it. If you are not confident about your son... How can we get our daughter to marry your son? Tell me. - Don't mistake us. I might get my daughter married to one who has lost his limbs. But not to a drunkard who has lost his path. How much did you claim? 40 or 50 sheep? Why aren't you replying? What happened to him? What happened, uncle? Get up, uncle. What happened? Careful. Just hold the breathe. Will be back in a jiffy. Uncle... Have this. Get up. Get up. Careful... Slowly... Am I the most sought girl in the town? Once my dad refused to give his consent... You should have challenged him and get you son married... To some other girl. Rather you are crest fallen. I'm not looking someone to act in a play... But the savior for the rest of his life. Your dad is my distant relative. So I had a hope. But luck wasn't on my side. Let the fate take it's route. God bless you. It was my dad who refused to accept the offer. I didn't. I will marry your son. Let's fix the engagement the next Friday. I will convince my dad. Dear... It won't work out. What if your dad take this issue to the public? How do I face it? You need not worry about it. My dad won't act against my will. You can focus on the requisites. Okay. Dears... Are you sure that you will stick to your promise? Wait a minute. How are you Mr. goldsmith? - Not bad. You are smart enough to be wealthy. Ward of the evil eye. We are thieves, but this thief will steal from us. It's Senthatti's. This one's Eepuli. This one... Soathumootti... Isn't this, your work? Hey...Mockery? - I was just trolling. I'm being generic. These tiny ornaments and kids jewellery... Won't matter much. They can't earn your food and liquor. He is accurate. Do something that will settle your lives. This is what bad friendship gifts you. It will make you lose your beloved ones. I witnessed that eye worthy phenomenon. When 'Chevalai' embraced you... You slit its throat in a jiffy. Someday we will be substituted for the goat. Please be quiet. Go... What happened? You can't claim anything that's not yours. Even the food. The body repels the stolen food. Stop rebuking. Was your visit the worth? As if your son is the most eligible bachelor in the town. Be precise. Marudhappan declined the offer. But God was on our side. Semponnu agreed. She has invited for the formalities on Friday. Educate him. Ask him to mend his ways. Wait... Where are you going? To pee. Postpone it for a while... You were the one who advised against it while I was a kid... Why are you speaking contradictorily now? Look at Mr. Moral speaking of the principles. I know what you are upto. Shut up and follow my lead. You are so used to scolding him that you can't be nice to him. You take leave. He earned well and is spending well. Pass it. Pass it to the girl. Semponnu! Thank you very much. Groom is drunk. Look at the prince whom you desperately wanted to marry. Still you haven't lost it all. Just say 'no'. I will thrash him away. It's like digging your own grave. Keep quiet. - Your father is to be blamed. He taps to your tunes. They can't even afford a plate. But they are up with the traditions. [indistinct chatter] Let's finish the formalities before the auspicious time passes. Marudhu, proceed with the formalities. I want to clear certain things before that. We know the stature of the groom. This man managed to convince my daughter. I don't have options. I'm risking my daughter's life... It's a tradition in our clan. The competition held by bride's parents to check the groom's valor. Let him win that... And fix the betrothal. Why is everyone looking perplexed? Such physical competitions were a must in my contemeporary. Only the winner can get a bride. But considering his condition, I doubt his victory. Make your son consume the butter milk. Have it. Drink. Give it. Have it... Have it I say... What are you staring at? Drink it. My fate... Non sense. Look at it. As if grroming was the only missing thing. Is a competition necessary after all this? They already are behaving like a couple. I'm sure of my groom's vigor. But my dad's unsure. He will win the competition. Sir! A guy who had tea in my shop looks like a thief. Are you sure? He is following the couple on a cycle. Give it to them. Come on hurry up! He is snatching the chain. Don't cut the wedding chain. Catch those thieves. Spare them not. Leave them not. - Catch him. Sign here. - Hello sir. Shall I take leave? You presence is required in the court. Okay. Shall I take the jewels? He cut off my daughter's wedding chain in a flash. He must not be spared. He must repent it. I will take care. I too have a grown up daughter. I can be think in your shoes. I'll take care. Get the grooms ready for the rituals. I'll begin the proceedings. Hey! Eat and get ready. Eat atleast to bear the pain. Don't ponder much. Start eating. We will be jailed atleast for 2 to 3 years. It's our end. A good food will become a luxury. We could have been stayed happy with petty crimes. The smith is to be blamed. I will... The Dubaikaaran. Who is he referring to? A lady? The lady sheperd. Where would have they gone? - Not sure. Search! Who is it? - - Look there. Search over there. Throw the light. Look over there. Who are you? What are you doing in the pen? Dad! I'm a localite, madam. I'm popularly known as 'Dubaaikarar'. - That's fine. What are you doing here? Some thieves had stolen our jewels. We are in search of them. None came here. You are disturbing a lonely girl. Sorry! Come on guys. I'm disturbed. I got my only daughter married with a great difficulty. They stole all the jewels. Let alone the jewels. She got married in the morning. They cut off her wedding chain in a few hours. It's all her fate. None to be blamed. I'll take leave. Take care. Sir. Catch them. Don't let your anger cool off. Sustain the anger. We will slay when time assists. They have been remanded for 15 days. They will be jailed for atleast 2 years when judgment is passed. Can I talk to them? How much do you have? Make it quick. Senthatti! Why did you do it? Why is he pointing me? How long will you be serving us? We wanted to repay. So... A new plan? I have bribed the cops. None will beat you up. Thank God. I have some money. Hide it up. I heard you get things in jail. I have a good news for you. The three musketeers pals... Have been arrested in a looting case. Good they got nabbed. Come here. Come I say. Pechi! Pechi! What? - Get some sesame oil. Where were you? Town... - I can guess. Bring it. Apply on his head. What are you staring at? Apply it. Bend over. Let me apply. - Bend. Apply generously. Go and get immersed in water and wish for evils things to ward off. Is it cooked enough? - Yes. Switch off the flame. - Dear! Why are you so tensed? Maayan is missing. What are you blabbering? He must somewhere around here. He is nowhere around here. He couldn't be found. Its us who has to repent the most. It was you who poisoned my daughter's thoughts and... To be blamed for this situation. Why are you shedding fake tears now? We didn't imagine this situation. You don't deserve to justify. This is how you convinced my daughter with your sugar coated words. Forget it, Marudhu. Let's think of the alternative. - No room for thoughts. My nephew is right here. Let him marry my daughter on the scheduled time. Ain't I clear? Do you have anything to object, Nellaiah? I object. I wished to marry Maayan and wanted to become their in law. Here I am. Period. I have accepted Maayan as my husband taking marriage out of the equation. I can't accept anyone else. You have a fair argument. But he is absconded. Did he abscond himself or someone instigated him to? My nephew should marry my daughter. That's possible only if you agree. I will even fall on your feet. - Why are you stooping so low? What's your final decision? I have decided to be his better half. Shut up. I will slay you. Don't try to threaten. I won't surrender to your intimidation. I will leave. I won't marry her even if she wishes to. The groom is hurt. I have an alternative. What? 'The flock is missing' 'What would he have done to them?' 'What do I sell to booze?' Are you worried thinking so? Worry not. My daughter in law has taken them to graze. You assumed that the marriage will be stopped if you abscond? We had a practice in our clan. Some had married in this way when I was young. There were no vehicles back then. Months would fly by, by the time men are back from grazing. It's impossible to find where men have laid a pen. They have to come in person. So there was a custom to marry such men. Groom's thoratti (tool for plucking leaves) will be assumed to be the groom and groom's mother/sister will tie the knot. Presuming the groom has tied it they will resume their wed life on his actual return. This is our custom. Hey Maaya! None is here. I'm talking to you. - I can understand. You are the one who stole in your own pen, aren't you? My dad has disclosed everything. Agreeing to marry you is an applaudable thing. On top of it, you want to defame me by absconding. I will... I didn't deliberately do it. Face me if you are brave enough. I am no coward. Proceed. You dad is to be blamed. Do you blindly obey him? Will you oblige him if he asks to drown in a well? Never. Fine. Why did you come here? To play games. For obvious reasons. Just like that. - Legally she is my wife. Liquor and spicy food... And you wanted me for your other pleasures. I'll mince your meat and make marinade of it. I didn't marry you for physical pleasure. The man who wanted to make you a respectable man. Your poor father who was ready to fall on my feet. I married you for his sake. Do you know how I sensed your arrival? Liquor odor. In our custom we even keep our sheep neat and tidy. But look at your appearance. The beard makes you look like a gypsy. A good shepherd is identified by odor of sheep stink. The day you smell so... Will be the day when we consumate our marriage. Get lost from my sight. Get lost. But look at your appearance. The beard makes you look like a gypsy. Maaya! What are you doing here? Just sitting casually. You have been causal all the while. Now you are married. The sunset... Should remind home. He is an ideal family man. Got it? Come. Come on. Dear... Where's your mother in law? - She is inside. Pass the fruits. I have obliged all her commands. She doesn't thrown even a glimpse. There it is. Mother in law... You wanted to prepare a marinade... Bring the knife... At this time? What's the urgency? We can prepare it in the morning. Shall we start? - Hmm... MGR movie is being played in a nearby touring talkies. We will go watch it... And will be back by the morning. Don't go today. Go when I ask you to. He doesn't have a presence of mind at all. Look into that matter. Come aside. Is it that time of the month? Then why not today? Let your son forfeit drinking and become an ideal husband. Then let me decide. You fool. You are yet to read men's mind. We will leave. What's it? - I'll let you know. Be gentle. She is threatening me to slay. You are asking me to be gentle. I'm not someone who can't harness temptations. I'm not sure how you judge me. I'm not sure if I am a good son to my parents. But for you... - Don't talk! She is gesturing me to shut up. Can you rub with your hands? This will do. Enough? - Rub it well. Pass it over. He is thoroughly wet. Come on, come on. Go. What's it? Have it. Take this. Have it. Take this. Serve him something as well. - Okay. Keep it over there. Mother in law... MGR movie is being played in the nearby touring talkies. Go watch the movie and comeback in the morning. We had already watched it. Today is the occasion. Let's go. God knows how many more times we need to watch the movie. [After few months...] Must taste a good non veg meal after we are out. Yes. Liquor with a good snack. Yes that too. Dubaikaaran? Hey guys. Seem to be new around here. - Yes we are. We are slaughter house dealers. We heard that Dubaikaarar cows are for sale. But his house is locked. He shifted his family to Dubai 2 months ago. Here you are to visit him. When will they come back? Its hard to predict a localite's travel. They have gone to another nation. None knows about their return. Look at the way they are staring. Hey! Why are you standing there? Why are you here all alone? Where is the flock taken for grazing? They are grazing. You seem to have come with a plan. I'm warning you. Just now I bathed as its an auspicious day. I can't bathe again to risk my health. I'll gently dry your hair. You are acting very childish. Your credit is Rs.33 including this. Clear it before you pass away. Here comes sir. Get down. Careful. Those three thieves... - Hold on... You have arrived to grandpa's house. Be careful. Proceed. The shepherd lady. Stop. Hold on. You are acting like a lunatic. Look around. If you act now, she will be safe. But we will be trapped. Let the sunset and darkness spread... We will let her soul pass in silence. Let's follow his plan. Who is in charge of the pen? Who is it? - We are from the next village. We are taking the forest route. Can you fetch us some water. Please wait. What happened? - Leg numbness. As I have been sitting in the same posture. Here is the water. Who is it? Guys!! Senthatti, Soathumootti... Wait... Eepuli... Have you gone deaf? Senthatti! Wait. When were you released? Don't show off your attitude. What's was wrong from my end? Who are they? - I get it. You are gesturing that I forgot you guys after getting married. Isn't that the reason? Did you forget the past? - You are being sarcastic. Did you atleast once visit us in the jail? I agree. It's my mistake. I apologize. You can punish me if you wish to. But being angry isn't the solution. Shall I fall on your feet? I will feel disappointed if you won't eat. Please come. Just follow me without creating a scene. You too, Soathumooti. Just dine. We can discuss other things in the morning. What's the curry? It's your favourite marinade curry. Come on. Come on, guys. Who are these guys? Why are you pleading them? Friends! - Friends? We are caught.. Seems to be new ones. Since when? - My old mates. They had gone out of station for an official purpose. Just now they have come back. I smell something fishy. We will just let them dine and send off. I'll explain the rest, later. Okay, get them inside. Come in. She has no idea about your imprisonment. Don't spill it out. Won't she allow you to join us if she knows the truth? Your are not open about your thoughts. Be quiet for a while. Let's discuss it later. Don't create a ruckus. Why are you behaving oddly? They are high on alcohol. Who is on high? Can you imagine the consequences if our identity is revealed? Don't raise your volume. She might hear it. If you are so submissive, why did you invite us for dinner? I know who you really are. My father in law has told enough stories about you spoiling my husband. I didn't trust his words then. But I trust him now. - Semponnu. Why are you raising your voice? Friends from the outstation? Their faces clearly show that they are prisoners. They are so desperate for meat and rice. Get lost. Listen... Ignore her. Don't go. You are so inhumane to understand them. Senthatti... A word is enough for a sensible man. Remember this for ever. Never ever meet my husband again. Have it. Eat. What are you staring at? - Hold the plate. You were tapping to my tunes. Now you are raising your voice on their return. Do you think I will be your puppet as I'm your wife? I'm not a typical woman who idolizes her husband. Be clear if you are prioritizing their friendship. I will get separated. What did I say? Don't think I will go back to my home. I will manage of my own. Why are you so vocal? You will bring them to dine. Then you will steal sheep for their monetary needs. If I bend to your requests... We will soon become bankrupt. They are like fleas on sheep. Cut off them, else they will dig your grave. You are lying to your very own wife. Do you really need this friendship? Think. Eat. He has fallen asleep. Pass it over. Unfortunately she is now Maayan's wife. She didn't identify us. Fortunately we had masked our faces. Whatever may be the plan, Maayan shouldn't have any idea of it. Don't under estimate him. He chased us just for a lamb. She is his soul. If she gets killed... And if he knows that we did it... He will avenge us for sure. Dude. It wasn't a true friendship. It was friendship for meat and marinade. But... That's right. Lets slay her first. If he intersects our plan, it's his fate. We are not to be blamed. Let's finish him as well. We must not carry the sin of separating a couple. Soathumooti, I haven't changed. It's them who have changed. What are you staring at? She is a woman. Being raucous is a woman's attribute. Even my father had insulted you a lot. My father had instigated her against you. She gets agitated while speaking of you. The way I used to slip away from my father's sight... Similarly I'll fool my wife to meet you. Are we your lady love to meet in private? I deserved this treatment. - Maaya! We aren't angry. As Soaththumooti said we were high. So we crossed the line. - Why are they acting nice? I have to tell him the truth. Leave it. Why are you looking perplexed? Maayan has brought a sheep to make curry. It was you who said it has been a while since we tasted good food. Me? Go to the shop... Get liquor and ingredients for curry. Maaya, give him some money. Go and get it fast. Come on. Sit. Forget it. Stop talking about it. Maayan is at risk. - Didn't you leave? Hurry up. Why are you being harsh? Only if he hurry him up, we can booze. Your focus is always on booze. It fills the occasion. - Dude... Dude, cops are here. - Cops? Why are they here? Leave us. - Why are you arresting us? Don't act like an innocent kid. You were released last morning. You have looted a jewellery shop the same night. We did say that we didn't loot it. - You didn't... Let's discuss in the station. I'll break the other one as well. Undress... Hey! - Sir. Do you want a special addressal? Undress, you idiot. I didn't commit any crime. I have no connection with the loot. Undress. - I swear I don't know. Won't you oblige? I will thrash you. Dressed like a groom. What are you staring at? Remove the lower. Undress... Undress this apparel as well. Hasten it. No please... - Hold and undress him. Remove it. Tear it up. Hold it, moron. Only last night, I advised him. After all the sermon, he has taken a sheep for them. Such a stubborn he is. Am I a fool? What happened? He must repent. Preaching won't change his ways. This incident will. If you release him... Let alone me... Even the God can't mend his ways. It's not that you alone are worried, I'm equally worried as well. When I saw his bloody face... I was almost dead. Sweeter words won't reach him. It will be soothing to him. He has to suffer. Only then he will change his ways. You won't admit? I swear on Karuppu (God), I didn't do it. Who is that? Your partner in crime? You didn't repent even after losing a hand. Pick up the phone. He is available, sir. It's for you. Hello... Yes... Found it? Where? Kerala border? Is it? Fine. Release them. Get their thumb prints as a precautionary. - Okay. Stop Maaya. Wait Maaya. Why are you angry with us? We have no part in this. You are not be blamed. But I am. Now I realise why people begged not to befriend you. You didn't feel ashamed when the cops scolded and stripped you off. But I wanted to strangle myself to death. Let me go. I have a different life to lead. But I can't turn away from you living in the same place. I will lead a life somewhere else. But till that, don't disturb me. That's all I request you. Maayan is here. They have beaten him up like a dog. I curse them to lose their limb. Stop sobbing. Did someone pass away? Semponnu, prepare for my bath. I want to end their relationship. Dad, let's leave this place. You people tried your best. It fell on my deafened ears. But now I have realised it. I didn't foresee such things. Your words of wisdom stuck me when I was beaten up to shame. Lesson learnt. I will be cautious henceforth. Lets shift to someother place? People from our clan have set a pen near Thanjavur. It's a fertile land. Shall we move there? Is it okay with you? The water has boiled enough. I will prepare the baggage. Okay brother. - We will take leave. I'll take bath. - You assist my mother. Don't mistake me. I followed my mom's steps when I was a toddler. Then my father was everything to me. Then I befriended these guys. Then you become my world. I had enough. I lead the life of a creeper depending on someone. I want to be independent. Hey Maaya, am I a fool? You will not bother about the sheep and come to me. I have to oblige you. But when I show ominous signs... You won't read it. Are you pretending? You are good for nothing. Mother in law... Are they playing any MGR movie in the talkies? Mother in law... Mother in law... MGR movie... She must not live happily with Maayan. Why are you looking perplexed? He is right. You are not trustworthy. Swear on God. Come on. Don't do it. Control your anger. Swear before it goes off. Please, listen to me. Promise us. Do it. - I can't. Why should I? Taking God's company to commit an evil act. What huge mistake did she commit? She got us nabbed... Only when she came to know when we cut off the wedding chain. I gestured him against it. It's all because of that sin. Every women wishes her husband to be a good man. She did the same. Enough. We have exploited him too much. I will not take part in this. Relieve me. Let's part our ways. I will somehow take care of myself. Lets end it here. There should be atleast some traces of courtesy. He had served us meat and marinade treating us like kin. How did you even think of harming his family? Ran a thorn? It's not a good sign. Showing off! Let's go. Answer him. Is your mouth stuffed? We had promised to share grief or joy. Let me go. Leave me. Leave me. I'm going. Where are you going? - No not far. I will go get the payment. - Return soon. What happened? Hurt? - Nothing. Rest a while before you leave. It's okay, mom. - Atleast drink some water. You should have noticed the stone. Fetch it fast. Give it to him. - The water is silted. It's okay. Water shouldn't be wasted. Have it. Shall I climb and shake it? Ignore it. You separated Maayan from us as we feared. Don't force me to disgrace you. - Give us a fair reason. You are claiming as if you were true to him. I need not do anything. He himself has decided to cut off your friendship. The gentlemen claiming a fair reason. Didn't get it? We pleaded you the same way not to get us nabbed. But you didn't oblige. What's your problem if a stranger's life is spoilt? Will the Dubaikkaran save you now? Please leave me. - We can't. We have suffered a lot because of you. You can't be spared. Hurry up. Drown her. If someone creates a ruckus after drinking our liquor... Most lose their sense after a booze. Then how will they create a ruckus? Help me. Save me... Save me... A girl is screaming. Drown her. Come let's go. - Yes. What are you doing? Performing a ritual. Mind your business. You are committing some crime. I heard a girl screaming. Don't do it. A women's curse will torement you for ever. Your daughter is married in Sokkaampatti, right? I saw her with a baby bump. Maaya! Semponnu is missing after she went to fetch water. Not sure what happened to Semponnu. Nothing bad will happen for a good man like you. It's inside. Someone assist him. One can't carry it alone. This is true friendship. They were spontaneous. None of us did. They were so close. They will come in need. Alas! He is dead.. He has left us and gone away.. Nothing bad will happen for a good man like you. This is true friendship. They were spontaneous. They are like a fleece on a sheep. Cut off their friendhsip. Else, they will dig your grave. I suspect Maayan's friends behind her death. I noticed finger marks on Semponnu's neck while bathing her. Maaya. I know that you will cook meat for them. I prepared it to reduce your burden. Okay. Return soon. There is a ritual to be held for Semponnunu. - Ok. Till then you have to fast. Not even a drop of water. You know it, right? Go. Maaya... You always get the sheep and prepare the curry here. This seems to be new. Soathumooti is missing? He was the one who missed the meat, the most. We have set him a task. He will be back soon. Come eat. For whom are you taking it? For Soathumootti. It's not poisoned. You can have it without any doubt. Just like a snake preys its own snakelet, you killed him. We will spare you just for the sake of our friendship. Embrace your life and leave. I have made my mind 'Not to spare you'. You boast your valour to a lonely lady. Maaya, don't do it. Please... With these very hands I have slaughtered many sheeps for you. But you butchered my very own soul. I will... You have 'n' number of reasons to murder her. 'She was my wife.' Wasn't this reason sufficient to spare her? I was just your meat provisioner. Just think of the past. Did you? Did you? - Atleast spare us for the sake of saving you and your father. Shedding crocodile tears? You took me for granted? If I kill my very own friends... I will fall in your category. You shall reap what you sowed. Cold blooded animals. The food has turned blue. He has poisoned the food... And preaches like an ideal man. You nose is bleeding. Is it the one? - of course. Yes. It's their end. The liquor seller has avenged us. Come on, guys. Let's drink this tamarind extract and puke out. We can save ourselves. How did he come here? I will slay if you get up. Don't move. Thirsty... Water...
