Stand back! Stand back! It's over. President Zápotocký died at 3:52 am. Comrade President has passed away. A communist heart has ceased to beat And lips have spoken their last words... CHARLATAN Have you got your bottles? Yes... Good... Come with me. Good morning. - How do you feel? - Not very well. - I'll have a look at you later. Let me see... The fever's not coming clown. She doesn't eat much. Shh... It's OK... This was done by butcher, not surgeon! Continue applying chamomile. You'll be just fine. Believe, and you'll be fine. Hang in there. I'm going to prepare it. Clear bottles only. I'll give you this one. Give me 15 crowns, you can urinate over there. That's fine, you can go in. Next. - Wipe your mouth. - Excuse me? Mr. Mikolášek hates women in makeup, he'll throw you out. Bottles! The bottle has to be clear. - I haven't got another one. - I'll give you one. 15 crowns. - That much? - Yes, 15 crowns! - Only one? - The rest was seized at Central Post. And the papers full of lies about you again. Two more. But you are the last ones, OK? Only two sets of fifty samples. The postwoman said the rest was seized in Prague. At least we'll start treating patients sooner. Male, 38 years old. Chronic infection of lower respiratory tract. Take mix number three for 5 weeks. Warm compresses and goose fat poultices. Number two. Female. 56 years old. Kidney stones. Take mix number one and drink at least three liters of lukewarm parsley tea daily. Number three, female. 62 years old. Nothing we can do here. - What should I write? - Whatever you want. Pancreas. Diagnosis cannot be determined from the sample, an immediate visit to the doctor is recommended. She'll be dead before she reads it. I can tell them you aren't well today. Next sample. - You help everyone but your... - Male, 54 year old. You can't walk in there like that. You must wait for your number. EXPERT OF MEDICINAL PLANTS You suffer from severe discharge, isn't that so? If you don't fix that, you'll never get pregnant. Our doctor said I'm infertile, that I can't have children. Is that what he said? Stand up, please. You are young and strong. There is a lot of life inside you. Your doctor is a fool. No one told you to come in! You're going to give yourself herbal douches. And rub this on twice a day. Where do I rub it? On your husband's genitalia. It's a mix of thyme and oak bark. If he doesn't stop cheating on you, you'll never fix your problems. You can pick up the herbs from the nurse in the waiting room. Number 38! I brought you something. Have you got your urine? - Do your toes hurt you? - Don't even remind me. They hurt like the devil. You have to stop eating meat. Every piece of meat you swallow settles in your joints. You have gout. Soon, you won't be able to bend your fingers. - But I'm a butcher, Doctor. - I'm not a doctor. You're going to have to choose. Do you want me to kneel? We only kneel in church, Johana. Then tell me what to do so you'll listen to me. You've already said everything. Come eat. But the money isn't for me! It's for your niece. She didn't even want to come. she's so afraid of you. I'll pay you back, I swear. Mrs. Johana! Mrs. Johana, wait! This is for you. I can't accept this from you. You are too kind. It's not from me. Your brother prepared it for you yesterday. Why does he always have to humiliate us like that? Let me see. Can you lift it? How about your arm? Good. I'll hold her for you. I don't think it's polio. In the hospital they told us his legs were deformed by polio. And I'm telling you the boy needs sunlight. It's a deficit of vitamin D. You should take him to the seaside. Where will I get the money for that? They locked my husband up. I don't even know where he is... You'll get an ointment to increase circulation and relax his muscles. And you will have to exercise with him. This is for the seaside. - Thank you! - No, no, that won't do at all. Thank you. Thank you so much. - She's beautiful. - Thank you. Ten Unbelievable Chapters of a Charlatan. We visited the offices of the would-be famous oracle of urine. Jan Mikolášek of Jenštejn. The parasite preys upon proletarians for his own enrichment, riding around in an American car, drinking champagne and laughing in the face of justice. You might not be cured in Jenštejn, but you are certain to be robbed blind. How much longer are we to suffer this ulcer in our communist body? How much longer is that charlatan to prescribe his herbs to naive old women? That's enough. Beware all you. Mikolášek's out there! Communist justice will soon give you the medicine you deserve. Prison! It's been there for three weeks. Every evening, the same car. Anyone can park in the street. Why are you so afraid of retiring? You'll tend to a small herb garden and they'll leave you alone. I agree, sir. You don't need to be spied on. I didn't mean to offend him. Stop here. We only have two patients left. Then we can go to town for supper, what do you say? So much good in one leaf. But for whom? I want to go home. Jan. - What's going on? - There's someone from the ministry. Good evening. How can I help you? You don't remember me? - I've been here before. - We see hundreds patients a day. Mrázek. - Kidneys? - Acute kidney failure. 1951. You sent me straight under the knife. If I'd stayed home, I'd be worm food. You have to get out of here, Mr. Mikolášek. - I can get you a passport. - I don't understand. Yes, you do. I've offered all I have to the state! - You have friends abroad. - I can work at the state hospital. State Security has begun investigating you. Nonsense! I have good relationships at all ministries. I treated President Zápotocký. The President died. There are no good relationships left. I only heal people. - You don't understand me. - No, you don't understand me! These people need me. The score is now even. Good luck. He's been drinking your tea. His arm doesn't hurt anymore, ifs his stomach now. He didn't know he was supposed to rub it on! Mikolášek, Pitha. Lauda. Come here! Move! Out! I didn't mean to do it! Please don't kill me! Line up! Ready! You won't do it! - Take aim! - Brothers! I said take aim! Do as you're commanded! Last chance! Take aim! Fire! I'm sorry. But you've already told me a hundred times. People have read the Bible a hundred times and understood nothing. You have patients in Chicago. Let me call them. The worst punishment is having a choice. Jan! Nice. Very nice. You couldn't even tie radishes before the war. We'll do a cutting of geraniums this afternoon. Mother would like you to join us on a pilgrimage on Sunday. - I'll stay in the shop. - Alois can stay. I'll help Johana with the watering. Her leg's been hurting again. Trust me, I've done all I could. The gangrene has gone too far. - Amputation will save her life. - Amputation? I've written you a recommendation. Professor Keitel is my good friend. This is not about her leg, it's about her life. They're going to cut your leg off anyway, so what does it matter? Why are you so mean? Stop it, you can't do that. Please, go away. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Are they all relatives? This is my old man, he suffers from varicose veins. He's 43. And this is his mother. She's 70. - And the other eight? - I can't tell you. You'll have to. I need to know the sex and age of every patient. This... No, this one is from Comrade Cooperative Chairman's wife. And these are from the girls in the cow shed. They say you're a conman and a charlatan. Saw it in the paper. But I've only heard people sing your praises. The town has offered to buy the house - and turn it into a kindergarten. - I haven't heard about that. Because you don't want to! You waiting for them to lock you up. Your husband has a heart problem. That's why he has varicose veins. You wanted to live in the country. Move somewhere far away. I'm prescribing buckwheat and black rowan. What about me? What should I do? Pack your bags and leave. Is that really what you want? Yes. Buy your mother-in-law mix three for the respiratory tract, and make her stop smoking. Dear God... No. We need your help. - No! - Johana, please! - Johana! - I don't want to! - You must be brave, Johana! - Please. - Everything will be fine. - I don't want to, Daddy. - Be strong. - Be calm, little one, be calm. - Everything will be alright. - lt'll be over soon. - You won't feel a thing. - Don't cry. - Ether! - Be brave... Wait with the ether. Well, it certainly looks serious, but it's not for amputation. - Thank God! - It's OK. One or two toes, perhaps. But I'd wait with that too. Secure the premises! Get dressed, gentlemen! The fun's over! What are you doing? These people are ill! - Where's Mikolášek? - Probably asleep. - Where's his bedroom? - Where's his bedroom? - That way! Get everyone downstairs in ten minutes! Got it? On your feet! The old man's gone. Fucking carny! Take them downstairs! Where's Mikolášek? Your name? And yours? What's your name? František. Palko. In the name of the Republic, you are under arrest. Where's Mikolášek? - He might be in the garden. - In the garden? At night? Are you tucking with me? - Have you looked in his office? - Where is it? Jan Mikolášek? State Security. In the name of the Republic, you are under arrest. What for? Secure all records, card indexes and ledgers! Come on, let's go! How many patients do we have tomorrow? - No talking. - A 150 by mail... What in God's name are you doing? I'm going to complain. I said it clearly, no talking! Get in! Believe, and your faith will heal you. Is that what you tell your customers? That's what Jesus said. I tell my patients that faith is half of a successful treatment. Faith in your own strength. Do you know why you are here, Mikolášek? I suspect someone squealed on me. Your suspicions are wrong. I would like to make a phone call. To whom? I recently treated Minister Duriš for asthma. You are not going to call anyone. I want my lawyer. - Your lawyer? - Mr. Finsch. Former chairman of the bar. He's represented me for 20 years. Mr. Finsch... Times have changed. Mr. Miraculous. How dare you talk to me like that? Nowadays, no one can escape justice by having an expensive lawyer. I know my rights. You have none, Mikolášek. Is everyone here to see Mrs. Mülbacherová? My shoulder. An injury from the war. - It still hurts. - Do you have your urine? Bones are healthy. Kidneys are a bit slow, but that's not the reason you've come to see me. - I can't sleep at night. - Then don't sleep during the clay. Don't throw it in the garden, there's a barrel for it. Who are you? The son of Mikolášek the gardener from Rokycany. I... I would like to learn to heal like you. Look out the window. Is that what you want? They don't even leave me alone on Sundays. - I know I have the gift. - You know? I healed my sisters leg. I'll pay you. They're hot... Sit down over here. Next! Good day. - The reverend sent me to see you. - That's enough, sir. What's wrong with him? Well? I don't know. Where is your gift? Look at him! - He's going to die. - Bravo! All of us are. Next Tuesday. Get out. Get out, and never come back. You understand? Beat it! Lawyer's visit! Let's go! Jan Zlatohlávek. I'm your lawyer, ex officio. - Where's Mr. Finsch? - Comrade Finsch refused to defend you. That's impossible, I saved his son's life. - Sit down, please. - In that event, I'll plead my own case. - Mr. Mikolášek... - I want to go. Take me back to my cell! You haven't understood the seriousness of your situation. It's just a mistake. The prosecution wouldn't seek the death penalty for a mistake. Excuse me? Sit down. Is it true that a fortnight ago you diagnosed someone with acute anemia from a urine sample? I see 200 patients daily plus 100 more samples from around the country. So it is feasible? We keep detailed records. We can locate every patient. That's been taken care of. A copy of your records states that you prescribed mix three and had it sent to an address. Mix three is for respiration and hemopoiesis. We send thousands of them. The police report from Kopřivnice: The urine sample belonged to Karel Strouhal, street committee chairman. Upon receipt, he prepared the tea for himself and a colleague, Josef Kosík. Both the members of the Communist Party since 1947. After drinking the tea, they unconscious. Death occurred during transport to the hospital in Ostrava. Nonsense. No one's ever died from coltsfoot. This is the statement of the medical examiner. Strychnine? It was discovered in the stomachs of both men. It is derived from... Nux vomica. ...nux vomica. The mix was served in a fatal dose. If they were poisoned, it wasn't from my tea. Five witnesses confirmed that the men involved consumed nothing besides the tea. Strychnine is in every rat poison. Two of your patients are dead, there are five eyewitnesses and the poison was found in your home along with the rest of the contaminated tea. If you know how to get out of this yourself, I'll be glad to inform the prosecution, believe me. Old Krejča passed away. How did you know? Sometimes I just do. I look at someone and I know when they will die. - When will I die? - I don't know. Come Saturday, half past six. If you're me, don't come at all. Thank you, Mrs. Mülbacherová. Thank you so much. A lamp is useful when the sun isn't out. But this is much more reliable. My husband used this shell to teach me. Urine must be taken in the morning when it's most concentrated. At most three days old. The particles dissolve in the urine and highlight the patterns. If you try hard, you won't need it at all in a few months. Slightly cloudy at the top. Greenish. Stomach. You tell me. You must be able to speak about what you see. If you learn the right words, you will also learn their meaning. - It looks like little grams... - Bravo. - Kidney stones? - Gallbladder. They spread out along the sides, see? I'll never learn this. Then take your knapsack and say goodbye. Slightly cloudy. A bit of a film at the bottom. Infection. You can tell an infection by the sediment. My guess is ears or teeth. The weaker the sediment, the further it is away from the kidneys. Don't ever try to do miracles, my boy. People will never forgive you. - But you do miracles. - Balderdash! Believe, and you'll be fine. That's my magic. General weakness: leaves of black currant, heartsease, leaves of birch, and nettle: dandelion root. You know them better than me. Leaves of Wormwood... I'm a gardener. Why don't you charge tor treatment? You could make a fortune. That's exactly why. All that leads you away from people is evil for the herbalist. Avoid that. Leaves of birch... - I've never seen you in church. - I'm in the flower shop on Sundays. I would like you to pray with me every morning. - Why? - So you know where you belong. - It's not really my thing. - Then you'll learn it. And try smiling sometimes. Jan? - This is chamomile, isn't it? - Yes. Mother needs help with the laundry. I would like you to stop going there. - Why? - You know very well why. I'm keeping up with my work. I go to market. On Sundays I'm in the shop. People are talking. - You belong in the glasshouse! - I don't care what people say. Do you want them to laugh at us? At me? At your mother? - She teaches me for free. - Teaches you? What does she teach you? To read from a crystal ball? She's an old phony! And her husband was a carny! - She heals people. - I've told you, you're staying home! Dad! Open the door! Jan! Don't be stupid! Put it down! Put it clown! - Don't be stupid! - Put it down! Jan! Stop it! If only you knew half of what she does! - If only you did! - Put down the axe! Hands on the blanket, Mikolášek. Lie on your back. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this clay our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. - A slight greenish-yellow haze. - That's right. - Intestines. - Liver. Liver juices. Go on. Quite viscous: gallbladder stones. It would have to be more orange. Looks like inflammation of the uterus. Thin grey film, tiny strands. Probably diabetes. Diabetes. What? Keep going. I don't see anything in here. - Whose is this? - Mine. - Why are you here? - I don't want to enlist. Because of my mom. I need advice. Don't think too much of yourself. You still don't know anything. I know. Kidneys. How long did you stay with the woman? About a year and a half. Until her death. Did she lake care of you? I helped her with herbs. She taught me to diagnose from urine. - What did she charge? - Whoever warned to could leave some money at the parsonage. She was very pious. She only offered people tea. We both know that selling dried grass is pretty damn lucrative. - How much did she have out of it? - I don't know. Why didn't she bequeath anything to you if she had no relatives of her own? I wouldn't accept it. You lived with her for a year and a half. You took care of her till the last. wiped her shitty ass... What? You have high blood pressure. You shouldn't drink coffee. Something you did pissed her off. Throw them into deep water so the poor things don't suffer long. There's nothing we can do, they'd eat us out of house and home. Mr. Mikolášek? Mr. Mikolášek! Are you ill? They turn the lights on at night. and I can't sleep. There's only three more weeks till the trial. The people's judge has already been named. - Where is František? - František? - My assistant. Oh. Mr. Palko. He has his own lawyer. Today we have to talk about your practice before the war. God, why? Why are you all so interested in what happened instead of what didn't? I didn't do anything! My task is to find all extenuating circumstances. I can't do that if I don't know everything about you. You testified that two years after Mrs. Mülbacherová's death you moved to Dobruska. Why didn't you mention your wife, Božena Mikolášková? It's not important. Was she your patient? Our marriage wasn't a happy one. Is that enough for you? František Palko... How did you meet? Mr. Mikolášek? In 1935, I took out a loan and bought a dilapidated mansion at the edge of Jenštejn. I wanted to turn it into a sanitarium and practice healing. I needed an assistant. Was he a healer too? Unfortunately for you, I'm looking for someone to be my right hand. Not a stenographer! I would have put an ad in at the post office! Good day! - Here you go. - Thanks. Anyone else? Go ahead. I'm not in any rush. Take a seat. Are you going to stand in the doorway? I sat in the train. Where have you come from? From the east. Like the sun. - Will you let me know your name? - František Palko. - Have you any education? - A vocational school. A vocational school. So you can read and write. "Seeking an assistant for the practice of natural healing. Requirements include typing skills. final exams in biology welcome." - What of that can you offer me? - All of it, if you give me time. I'm sorry you made such along trip. Send in the next one. Mr. Mikolášek, please. I'm supporting my wife and mother. I'm sorry, I have appointments. I can offer you complete loyalty. - That goes without saying. - Well... Really? Careful what you say. You should leave. Is that the wish of my employer? Did you choose the aftershave yourself? Can I get rid of him? Yes. 40, 41, 42.43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. - You're the last ones today. - The last ones? What do you mean? If you aren't better by tomorrow, come in the morning. - Take the children at least! - You can last one more day. - Have you got a cigarette for me? - Should we weld it on here? - Yes. First twenty. What took you so long? You're holding me up. Mr. Koudela, 62 years old. Gallbladder and digestive tract. Excuse me. Take mix number two for ten days as herbal tea. That's 30 crowns. - What's mix number two? - You weren't listening yesterday? To help us heal so many people, I devised four basic herbal mixtures. One is kidneys and female problems, two is stomach and digestion, three is respiratory tract and circulation, tour is musculoskeletal. All the rest is mixed individually. Have you already read the lexicon of herbs I gave you? - Do you want to test me? - I want you to know them. And I'll get you more books too. Thank you. - Send in the next one. - Thank you. You don't have a number. I've been waiting since morning! - Mr. Kiesewatter... - I have to speak with you. I've already told you, there's nothing I can do for your daughter. - You have to help her. - I'm sorry. Take her to the hospital. - Come with me. - I can't. I have patients here. - Mr. Mikolášek, please! - Mr. Kiesewatter... - You have to come with me! - Don't touch me! - You help everyone, but not her? - No one can help her anymore. You can't say that! Make her some tea. Come with me! Now in German so you'll understand. She's going to die. You have to save my little girl! He has to save her! The way people behave nowadays, huh? Helplessness is unbearable. - Come here. - Yes. No! No! Not this! No! No! Do you think there will be war with Hitler? I don't understand politics. Mrs. Palkova. Bravo! I haven't played for ages. Have you even asked if our guest eats chicken? I don't know anyone who doesn't eat chicken. - Do you eat chicken, Doctor? - I'm not a doctor. František says you work miracles. Bon appétit. Eat up so it doesn't get cold. I only do what nature allows me, and what God allows nature. Nothing more. - I don't think so. - You are an overly modest person. Just an errant one, Mrs. Palkova. as František well knows. He never wastes a word on praise, you can believe me. No one ever taught him how. Come inside. Teraxacum officinale. Asteraceae family. Flowers aide the upper respiratory tract, roots increase bile production and accelerate peristalsis. Leaves soothe symptoms on kidney and urinary tract infections. Miraculous. Stand up! It's crooked. Do you hear? It's crooked, redo it. Farewell, gentlemen. - Bye, Jan. - Wan! Why do you continue to go there? Because she's my wife. - Your wife? - Yes. I want you to get a driver's license. - Why? We don't have a car. - I'll buy one. You wanted to learn how to drive, right? - You'll buy a car? - Yes. On Saturdays and Sundays we'll visit patients. If you don't like it, I'll find someone else. Go ahead. This is amazing! We're driving! - OK. but slow down. - It just goes by itself! - It's got 55 horse power. - Slow down. - Hold onto the wheel! You'll kill us! - Take it for a second! No! Stop it! It bit me in my butt! Since 1936, you have used the title "certified herbal expert". What the fuck is that? I had to take a licensing exam. They showed me 80 herb samples in tablet form. I had to determine their Czech and Latin names. You could tell the difference between 80 herbs just like that? Not just like that! I've been learning to distinguish them my whole life. I could even taste them. Each herb has... its own unmistakable taste and smell. - Who was at the exam? - I don't remember everyone. I know Professor Jaros and Docent Karavy were there, and the head of Thomayer Hospital whose ulcer I healed. - So you treated doctors too. - I had a wide range of clients. Hana Benešová, Olga Scheinpflugová, Švabinský... What about the Nazis? K. H. Frank? Or Hacha and other traitors? You forgot about them, didn't you? But we know who you treated! - I never was a member of... - Shut up, I didn't ask you anything! I'm sorry I didn't pick you up five years ago. Things would be different. You'd be licking your own shit off the floor and thanking me for it! Why are you looking at me like that, you bastard? You will die very soon. Get him out of here. I can't look at his face any more. Stalin would show you! Why didn't you wake me up? It's almost eight! No one's here. - The Germans razed Lidice yesterday. - What Lidice? They shot nearly 200 people, there, on the spot. My God. Why? Revenge for Heydrich. For the assassination. People are too scared to get sick. Hello there! Looks like we're needed alter all. Did you run away? Come here, come! Get the stick! That's a good boy! Maybe it could use some stitching. Chamomile will do. I need to heal people. They told me you attacked the barber. I thought they had the wrong name. Why in the world, Mr. Mikolášek? You don't even know how lucky you are that he took you clown. - You'd have another charge against you. - I want to speak to František. Does he have to wear that? Take it off. It's on me. Comrade, I have to pee. You'll see Mr. Palko at the trial. You didn't tell me you knew President Zápotocký. I don't distinguish between patients. Perhaps you should. The prosecution will. I treated millions of people. The more important they were, the more they clung to life. How did President Zápotocký find you? - It was thanks to Bormann. - Who's Bormann? Adolf Hitler's Chief of Staff. - You treated Martin Bormann? - Urinary tract and kidney stones. When was that? They wanted to hang me for it after the war. Fortunately there were a few people who testified that I'd financed the Resistance and had a brother in a concentration camp. Whoever was good enough for Bormann was good enough for Zápotocký. The protocol says you lived in Jenštejn for 20 years with your assistant. Both of you are married. František has his own flat in the building. As do the other employees. But Mr. Palko's wife never lived there. Working with me is time consuming. And Mr. Palko is indispensable to me. In Jenštejn they told me your relationship was very friendly. Homosexuality is a criminal offence. - Nothing like that has ever happened. - Nothing has ever happened? You'll never understand me. I'm getting old. Doesn't seem like that to me. What are you looking at me like that for? Do those nazi flags have to be on the car? Being a member of a German auto dub is not collaboration. If people are afraid to visit us, we have to visit them. I don't care what we have on our car. I need to heal people. My wife is expecting a baby. I wanted you to know. - That's not true. - She always wanted one. And the war will be over one day. I've given you all you wanted. - You want to humiliate me, right? - This is not about you. Will you move back to her? - And leave everything here up to me? - Look how we live. This has no future. We hide out like rats. I'm your employee, nothing more. Everything else is illegal! Don't you get that? What is it? Make her some tea with it. Nothing will happen to her. I swear. You bastard. - You can't do this to me, František. - It's my child! I need you. I beg of you. František! Do you even realize what you want of me? I won't do it. You'll starve to death without me! You piece of shit! You piece of shit! Staatspolizei! Open the door! - Open it or we'll break it down! - Gestapo. Mikolášek! Open the door! - I'm going there. - I'm coming with you. - No! - Yes! - No! They came for me! I'm coming with you. - Open the door! - Jan... Go and hide! František... I love you. So we meet again, Mr. Mikolášek. Your daughter had a liver tumor. I've been waiting 6 years for this moment. Her condition no longer allowed me to treat her. We have lots of information on you. Just half would get you guillotined. But Berlin has heard of your practice. We have to find out if you're a charlatan or not. Female, 22 years old. Excuse me... Ovarian cysts. Possible severe inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Likely infertile. - That agrees. Next! - Wait. I have something here... I can't diagnose through colored glass. Male, 48 years old. So you don't know? Mr. Mikolášek! The patient is dead. - Is that your final word? - Yes. I interrogated him this morning, he was fine. Peed by himself. - Guard! - Please! I'd like to have it verified. Find out what's happened to Kohn! How did you reach your conclusion? There is a large amount of blood and protein in the urine. It is evident that the kidneys failed several hours ago. Test number 7. Male, 40 years old. Please. This urine belongs to the same patient as in sample number 1. That's unbelievable! Here. That agrees. I'll inform the minister tomorrow. - We'll, tell us! - He died in the car. Even if you tattooed the swastika on your chest, you still do more for people than the entire Resistance. Did you give it to her? - Are you looking for someone? - Yes, I'm looking for the Strouhals. The Strouhals... No one by that name lives here. I have comrade Strouhal's address, he's a street committee officer. The address is right, but no one like that lives here. He had a tragic accident about 3 months ago. I've been the fiduciary here for 6 years. And there's no one called Strouhal in this street or building. Can I see your ID? - Thank you. - Just a moment! Your documents. I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. Goodbye. Hello. Mr. Mikolášek, I stall don't know where all your wealth came from. Just the pictures from your office were appraised at 350,000 crowns. Go to hell, Mr. Zlatohlávek. - The pictures were a gift. - From whom? I support eighteen sodalities, three orphanages, the National Committees in Jenštejn and Rokycany. I have donated 20,000 to North Korea's fight against imperialism. I send children to the mountains and the seashore at my own expense. How much do you do for people? I went to Kopřivnice. Neither of your victims lived at the given address. Two men with the same names suffocated in a coating room six months ago. So... finally some good news. It was just a mistake. You have to tell them that. Someone sent you urine under the name of Strouhal, and you sent him tea. I don't think I understand. No one is going to dispute the deaths. Everything happened. You gave them the evidence yourself. They can't sentence me for something I didn't do. You won't let them. They made up their minds about you long ago. And about me too. What are you going to do? You asked me about Mr. Palko. He hasn't given more than his name at any of the interrogations. The prosecution will recommend the death penalty. Why are your hands always so hot? Sometimes I think if I squeezed, I'd kill all of the bad that's in me. Then do it. I'll forgive you. Maybe next time. Stop! Right turn! Remove handcuffs! Stop! Right turn! Remove handcuffs! Sit! Sit! All rise. All sit. I hereby commence the trial in the case of Mikolášek and Palko. Prosecution, please read the charges. In the winter of 1958, the late Karel Strouhal sent a sample of his urine to the dubious business of the accused, Mr. Mikolášek. A diagnosis was then made without an in-person medical exam and the tea was sent for an exorbitant sum of money. Jan Mikolášek treated our mothers. He is an old man. Before the war, he passed a professional licensing test, and endured an even harder one at the Gestapo in Prague. - He treated many important people... - But treats his own kidneys at Bulovka. Comrade prosecutor, please remain calm. Of course, no one is infallible. Treating 300 patients a day, it is impossible not make a mistake. If the accused caused someone's death, he did so unintentionally... and is deeply sorry for what happened. According to the prosecution, it was an intentional attack on members of the Communist Party in Kopřivnice. The defense recommends requalifying the crime as unintentional manslaughter. With regards to the seriousness of the crime, the prosecution recommends both receive capital punishment. The accused František Palko has refused his lawyer ex officio. Thus he will be allowed to defend himself. Accused, come forward. Are you familiar with the full extent of the prosecution's charges? Have you anything to say in your defense? You can sit down. Would the accused Mikolášek like to say anything before the court deliberates? Honorable court, it is true that despite multiple requests to nationalize, I continued my business as a healer and herbalist. My life mission is to fight against illness with the weapons of nature. That is what I have done all my life. Thanks to selling herbs. I have acquired some wealth. I am not aware that the poison mentioned by the prosecution has ever entered in my house. For many years, the herb mixing has been done by my employee and dear friend, František Palko. The herbal mixes are prepared in the attic, where they are sealed and addressed to the patients. Everything has always worked perfectly so I never paid much attention to it. I don't even have the key to the attic. If poison really did enter the mixes, and I still believe it did not, then I do not and cannot have had anything to do with it. Thank you. You can sit down. The accused Palko, come forward! Would you like to respond to what Mr. Mikolášek has just said? Could he have known about the poison being added to the mixes? No. It was all me. I am responsible for it all. No! That's not true! - Calm down! - My son would never do that! He was afraid of him his whole life! It was him. He wanted him for himself! Bailiff! Lead her out! I am adjourning court till the afternoon. Exit the courtroom! - Quiet! - My son! I am adjourning court till the afternoon. Exit the courtroom! Turn around! Face the door! Turn around! Face the door! Lead him away! Lead him away! Several million patterns passed through the hands of Jan Mikolášek. If I have prolonged the life of one in a hundred people by a single year, then it would seem I have saved 40,000 years of life for this wonderful land. And I am happy, for I see what a remarkable life I have lived.
