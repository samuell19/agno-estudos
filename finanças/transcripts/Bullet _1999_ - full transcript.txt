[CAR APPROACHING] [MUTTERING] Man, your wife will be giving birth soon, right? Then why'd you report for work? We can handle this. You know me, I'm always present. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN GROANING IN DISTANCE] [GUNSHOTS] Nobody moves! This is the police! [GUNS FIRING] Stay here. Watch those men. Stop! Hands up! Turn around. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say... Sir! Sir, someone is calling for you on the radio. [GROANS] Sir, you've been shot. This is nothing. Go after him! But it's dark and he got away, sir. Your wife is in the hospital. It was radioed in. Be strong. Sir, this is as far as we go. - Doctor. - Your wife's condition is not good. The child is just seven months. Her condition is critical. Don't worry, Sargeant. We will do our best to save your child and your wife. Thank you. [MOANING] Doc! They're safe. Congratulations! It's a boy. - Thank you. - But we still need to incubate him. It's fine. We cannot continue to let Perfecto be with the other children his age. This is just a public elementary school, Mrs. Campiones. And our teachers here have no special training for children with disabilities. Ma'am, my child is not disabled. Ma'am, you have to face it. Autism is a form of disability. Please forgive me for the term I used. But you have to admit that your son is not normal. Autism is just a state of mind. He's smart, we just have to be more patient. There's a special school in Manila that can teach special kids. Like your son. Those schools are expensive, ma'am. We don't have the money. Just let him stay until the end of this year. His teachers are having a hard time dealing with him. And he hurts his classmates when he gets mad. We're all having a hard time because of him. I will look after my son every day. - If you will just let me. - But, Flor. Ma'am, Bullet needs your help. How can he learn the things he needs to know if he won't go along with normal children? I'm sorry, Mrs. Campiones. But I can't really help you. Good day! Bullet, let's go. Good one! You can't really win against me. Practice some more. It's Bullet. Bullet, come here! - Try to beat Bullet. - Him? He's nothing. He won't win against me. - Call anyone. Call anyone you like. - You're really a show-off. Bullet, let's play. Mom, can I play? I don't have a class tomorrow. Alright, you can play. But you need to go home early. Yes, mom. Let's go, Bullet. Let him use this. This is crooked. Win over him, Bullet, okay? He's too arrogant. Use this. Yes! Bullet is really good, huh? - You're good! - You're the best! You're really good, Bullet! You're really good, Bullet! You're good. This is ''Two.'' When you combine it with ''Three,'' it becomes ''Five.'' Bullet, I will cook fried chicken, If you can count the drawings, okay? Yes, mom. You'll cook fried chicken for me if I can count these drawings? Yes, but count these drawings first. Yes, mom. This is ''Two.'' One, two. This is ''Three.'' Once upon a time, there was a brave and kind warrior. He was a giant. When he saw little David, he insulted him and sarcastically asked him ''Do you think I'm just a dog?'' ''And you brought a cane to fight with me?' And he added ''Come here, so I can feed you to my birds and other animals.'' David answered, ''You brought weapons.'' ''But I will fight you in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel...'' ''that you've insulted. He will give you to me.'' And he carried his head back to Jerusalem. Bullet! Get up already! - Yes, dad! - [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] Bullet! Wake up now! Bullet! Yes, dad! Bullet! Bullet, son, follow me downstairs, I will show you something. And he said... Stop talking to yourself. You're alone in there. - Hurry up. - Bullet, son. - Stop it, go down now. - I must hurry... - Hurry. - Yes, dad. [GUNSHOTS] [LAUGHING] I'm still good. Go and check how many heads I've taken down. Mayor, you shot none. What? You want me to shoot you? But, Mayor, there's really none. Hey, you go and see, I think there's something wrong with his eyes. - Mayor! - Hey, partner! How's the practice? There, I had them count how many bullseyes I hit. There's really no hit. It all hit the ground. Mayor, there's really none. I think this gun has a problem. He should not be using guns. He should be using a sling or something instead. I used that last night, Mayor. - There's no problem with the gun. - Scumbag! Remember! If I'm not talking to you, keep quiet. Partner, regarding what we've talked about... Let's have your godson take a crack at it. - Bullet, look at your godfather. - Oh, right. It's your turn, son. - Go ahead. - Yes, sure. - Bullet. - Careful with that. - Remember what I told you. - Yes. Partner, you know very well, I never miss training with your godson. As long as it's about shooting. I can see that. He's well lectured. Go ahead. - Which one? - That! That! That! Hit the bullseye. In the middle. - [GUN FIRES] - [SHOUTING] Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Bullet. Son. I'm already deaf. It's too loud. He almost damaged my shoe. Partner, forgive your godson. You know... My ear hurts. Give it to me. It's too loud, dad. Do it again, son. Don't be scared. Don't be scared, alright? He said not to be scared. Wait. You know him. He doesn't want it loud. He tends to panic with loud sounds. Bullet, you should hit here. Here, center it here. - What? - Center it here. Wait. There. Center it here. - Here? - Yes. - Yes, godfather. - Alright. You can do it. - Whoa, Bullet is really good. - Nice. Partner... He's good at this. I think we can make use of Bullet's talent. - Alright, continue. Continue. - Yes. Hit it on the same spot. Partner... I think Bullet just got lucky the first time. I thought he's good. It was nothing. I have a good feeling. Wait. Come on. Wait a minute. You know, son, I am nervous around people with guns. Your hands are fidgety. My suspicions were correct, partner. All of the bullets hit the same spot. You're right. Wow, my godson's talent is awesome. We should put his talent to good use. Yes, but, I need to teach him first. The right way of holding a gun. Partner, I can hardly believe that you're the mayor of our town. [MAYOR CHUCKLES] Be shocked if I become the president of the country. That's what I've been telling you. Stop considering yourself a joke. Hey! When we're still in the service I can't remember anything you did right. Look at how you talk to me. Hard to tell, your jokes were serious. Good thing nobody could hear us. - You want me to tell you all of it? - What? You remember the time you eloped with Maring? That wasn't Maring, It was Clara. Enough of that. I came here because of this. Whoa, this is bigtime. This is a major competition in Manila. And the prize is big, partner. This is impossible. I know Flor won't allow this. I won't allow that. Your son has an extraordinary talent. Extraordinary talent? What's wrong with you? Don't you think it's too dangerous? You taught our son to use a gun. - You know, that he is... - He has a defect? Flor, your son's talent is not ordinary. I am not in favor of what you want, Piping. Flor, he's our son. He is the son of a policeman. So, he must learn how to use a gun to defend himself and others. What if your son's life will be in danger? When you use a gun for bad things, that's when you will be in danger. You just want to fulfill your dream. You will even use your son. Flor. Don't forget that our name is Campiones. (Champions) I will prove to them that I am not a loser. Bullet will bring pride to our name. He will become the champion. [GUN FIRING] Bullet, no! Yes, dad. I allowed you to join the contest because it's a sport. And that's your dad's dream as well, to get the medal for that competition, and to give pride to our town. But, Bullet. Remember this. You will never use the gun to kill a person. You understand that, son? Yes, mom. I love you, son. I love you so much. I love you, too, mom. I'm hungry, mom. Alright, we will eat. - We'll eat now. - Be good. Yes, mom. Flor, that's enough. The bus will be leaving soon. - Hey, man. - Hey. I just want to see you and bullet off to wish you good luck. And I will be the one to drive you to the bus station. Thank you. Don't worry, we will come back with a medal. Flory! We have to go! - Take care, Bullet. - Yes, coming. I'm just making sure you brought everything. Bullet, don't forget what I told you. - Piping, take care of our son. - Yes. Yes. - Of course. - Always pray, Bullet. - Don't forget. - Bullet, do your best! - Just send my regards to Ely and Rey. - Sure. Bullet, don't forget to pray. - Dad? - Yeah? Why is there a TV? TV should be inside the house, right? Why is there a TV inside the bus? It's for the passengers so they won't get bored during their travel. They'll be entertained until they get to their destination. That's why. Bullet. Hey, son. Remember what I've taught you about the proper way of holding a gun during the competition. - Yes, dad. - So, you won't get disqualified. - Understood? - Yes, dad. Dad, what's the meaning of, ''You have the right to remain silent?'' It's in the law. The person must be made aware of his rights. A policeman, like me, should know that. Dad? Dad? I got my traits from you. See, you look dazed while people talk to you. Take a nap. - Oh, Bullet! - Rey! Mom! Mom! Uncle Piping and Bullet are here! We're here. - Say hi to your Auntie Ely. - Yes, dad. - Say good afternoon. - Yes, dad. - Big brother! - Hey. Come on. Bullet, how are you? - She's asking how you are. - Hey, mom is asking you. I'm still handsome. Come on, hurry. I will show you something. Go inside. How's Flor? We left her, we won't be staying long anyway. - Come here, Bullet. - Hey! Rey, don't be naughty and don't fool around with Bullet. Bullet, behave. - Yes, mom. I'll take care of Bullet. - Brother, put down your bags. Come and sit. I wonder how Rey could relate to your son. I also don't know. I've been with Bullet for 30 years, everyday. But until now, I have to catch his attention before we talk. Brother, the prize for that competition is quite big. That's also the reason Flor agreed. So, we can save a little for Bullet. For his studies. Wait a minute, stay there. I will show you something. [WHISTLES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Look at this. [BULLET LAUGHING] Nice, right? The girl is pretty. - [BULLET GROANING] - Why Bullet? What happened? Wait, wait. Don't go out, Bullet! Don't go out! Sorry! Wait, wait a minute, Bullet! Rey, what's happening there? [STAMMERING] Bullet hit his hand. What? Bullet, let me see your hand. [MEN CHATTERING, LAUGHING] My boy. Oh, yes, about your father, I'm sorry, I've heard about it late. But anyway, I think your mom got the packages that I've sent. - Yeah, thank you. - Thank you. Now, Guchi, you call me here, this time of the night. Is there a problem? We're looking for a container van. - What's inside? - It's filled with sports cars. Well. Maybe I can help you here but... Can you give me any clue, so I can start looking for it. Yeah. I know someone in here. His wife is a Filipina. - Friend? - Yeah, friend. This is the address. I already have 30 million pesos. 30 Million pesos? We thank you, in the name of Jesus. Amen. - Amen. - You see, Rey. Bullet is better than you. Look, he knows how to pray. I'm also praying, mom. - Eat, Bullet. - By the way, Ely. - When is Bob coming home? - Rice... Viand... Next week, bro. I didn't allow him to extend his contract. Bullet, I wish you're still here next week, so you can see my dad. Yeah, big brother. It's been a while since they've been together. Why do you need to leave right away? Flor only allowed us to spend two days here. Nobody is with her in the house. So what, Bullet? Are you ready for tomorrow? Sleep early, okay? - Centerfold, playboy magazine. - [REY COUGHING] April Suzanne wet and delicious. Playboy magazine. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, sir. Call for Ferdie and Jonel, I want to talk to them. What's that again, sir? - [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Boss, someone arrived. He slapped me. He's looking for you. He said he wants to talk to you and boss Ferdie. You want me to kill him, sir? Just tell me. Watch your mouth. Stupid! Ferdie! Ferdie! I'm just starting, Joel. Don't bother me! The General is here. I'll follow. Excuse me. Wait, the door is closed. There are people inside. They might hit you. You can use the men's restroom instead. I'm sure you'll get beaten as well. Hurry up! He said he'll follow. Sherly? Is that you? I haven't told you, Ferdie has the clap, You might catch it, too. Is that true? Don't believe him. He's the one with the clap. He goes out with just anybody. - Sorry, sir. - Stupid! Fix that. Are you done fixing the faucet in the restroom? Sorry, General. I washed my face. Well, gentlemen. I have a deal with a certain Japanese. You need to find a container van. I will give you 500,000 as a down payment. Once you find it and have it delivered to me I will give you another two million. Sounds like a good deal to me. - Not bad. - Shoot! Shoot! [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - We can do it! - Nice! Go ahead, son! Do you understand the course of fire? Yup. Load and make ready. Shooter ready? - Yes. - Holster. - Shooter ready? - Yup. Stand by. Up! [GUN FIRING] Load and make ready. Holster. Stand by. Up! Bullet! Bullet! Bullet! Bullet! Uncle, how much longer for Bullet to win? It won't take long, He just needs to defeat some shooters. But there's still one tough opponent. That's Jethro Dionisio. He's quite famous. - His pulse is good. - Yes. But Bullet can defeat him. You're really proud of your cousin. Bullet! Bullet! Bullet! Bullet! Load and make ready. - Shooters ready? - Ready. Ready. Stand by. Up. [PEOPLE CHEERING] What can you say that you've defeated the champion, Jethro Dionisio? Have you had a hard time because he's autistic? Not really. An autistic can have expertise. For Bullet, it's target shooting. That's why. Congratulations, your son is amazing. - Thank you very much, sir. - Bullet, here's our car. - Here, Bullet. - Bullet, Bullet. - One more, one more. - One more, one more. Okay. [CHATTERING ON FILM] Boss. Thank you. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLING] Buddy, don't move or you'll die. [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [BULLET CHUCKLING] Dad. Dad. That's enough, eat first. This champ. It's delicious! Full champion! Take a shot of me, Bullet. Bullet is the champion. Eat well. Stop playing. - Bullet, eat. - Where? Let's go there. Here. Here. Film that. Press here. Dad, can we go out? Alright, but don't go too far. It will get dark soon. Mom, I'll go with Bullet. - Alright, stay with him, okay? - Yes, mom. Come on. - Hurry. - Let's go, Bullet! Run! Wait, are those two already done eating? I think not. Hey! Finish your food first! Rey! Let's go. I will show this to Bullet's godfather. The Mayor. I'm sure the entire town will be glad. Two... three. Four. The next time you pee, we will no longer let you get up. You can pee in your pants, okay? Stay there! Just tell us where the container is. - I don't know. - You're making yourself suffer. And you're dragging the girl with you. I don't know. Wait. - Let's go home. - We're almost there at the monster's house. - I'm tired. - Come on, hurry. I've been wanting to go there and catch him on tape. Maybe he's there right now. It's been a while. Come on! Let's go there! Give me the camera. Let's go, hurry! Monster! This is how you play. See that? I won again. This is your fault, you won't stop moving. The house is ruined. But that's the monster's house. That's the monster's house. Let's go there. - Sardines? - Stop fooling around. Let's go there. Hurry up! Let's go closer! You should do it this way. Watch and learn. Have pity on me. No! Someone is tied up. And then he's been threatened. - Who's the monster there? - The one who's been threatened. No! It should be the one tied up. He was tied because he's a monster. No, you're wrong. They are bad people. Look. Have mercy on us. I don't know anything about a container. One, two... Damn it, man. Do it fast. You're stubborn. I think you will talk now. Ouch! Please stop. No. No! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] - Bullet, let's go home. - Wait. - Let's go home, Bullet! - Alright! - Don't come closer. - Bullet, Bullet! Let's go here! Run, Rey! - Help me. - You're a monster! Help me. Kid, run now! You're a monster! - Let's go, Bullet! - Come on. He's dead. Bullet, maybe we should split up. So, they can't catch us. No! Let's stay together! No! I don't want to! Stay here. Rey? Rey? Let's go! He's gone. You two, check there. Boss, someone jumped in here. The one carrying the video cam. Boss, I think they've filmed everything we did. When we find them... They will forget their names. Hello! Mel, I'm on the highway. In Bulacan. What? The party's tonight? I thought it's next week? Wait, wait, what's the name of the restaurant? What? Wait. What? Where? Gosh. Wait, I dropped my pen. - [HORN HONKING] - [TIRE SCREECHING] [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, mister! What do you want to do with your life? What? Get down from there. Mister! Mister! What's happening to you? Are you a thief? Did you steal that camera? Maybe that's why you're hiding under the bridge. Are you a drug addict? He's retarded. Come on. I don't want to stay here. Let's go. Why? What's happening to you? Okay, okay. We're leaving. We're leaving. - I don't want to stay here. - We're leaving, shut up! Please! - Bro, let me do the talking. - Come on, hurry. Good day, sir. - Good day. - Good day to you as well. We will just report two missing kids. My son is short. His hair is straight. His eyes are slightly big. - Do you have a picture with you? - This is my son. And this is my son. This is no longer a kid. How did he get lost? Are you from the province? - My son is autistic. - What do you mean? Is that the same with ''fantastic'' or whatever? Colonel Campiones of Region 3. Sir, sorry... Ma'am. Just because you didn't know he's a policeman, you'll be rude? - I'm just joking, ma'am. - But we're not messing around. I'm sorry, ma'am. Sir. It's fine. Go ahead. Wait, I think this one looks like the one I saw in the newspaper. Beltran, can you please hand over the newspaper? My phone's dead. I'm so unlucky today. I just need to make a phone call. There, I will just look for a phone. Just stay here. I'll be back soon. You understand? I will be back soon, so just stay there. Gosh. Miss, can you just use the phone on the other store? I am waiting for a call. This won't take a while. This won't take long. Hello? She looks familiar. Hey, Poly! - Are you going to the reunion tonight? - She's a whore in Quezon Avenue. Where is it again? Will De Jesus be there? Leverato. Okay, see you there, bye! Yes. I will call Melba. Alright. Hey, miss. You're taking so long. You're being rude. Go ahead, do it. I'll make sure that it will be your last. Are we gonna do it? You heard her. Why would you still do it? And she's a woman, we're not supposed to fight her. Are you going to buy that, sir? I don't get this guy. This is such a bad day. Come in. I missed breakfast so I can go to work early yet I still didn't make it. I even took a different route so I can get there early. What? What happened to you? Come here. Over here! Gosh, I took a different route to avoid traffic. Then I found you. Jeez. I took a leave so I could rest a bit. But they're insisting that I should report. I would just make a phone call and got into trouble with those stupid policemen. What are you? What's wrong with you? Take a seat. Gosh. Why do I have to experience this? Who are you really? Bullet. Bullet. Oh, yeah. Bullet. Just stay there. I will dress you up. But you should bathe first. Damn it! Who told you to kill him and you even kill the wife? I told you to just kidnap him and scare him. So, we'll know where he hid that container van! It's an accident, sir. We didn't want that to happen. Sir, he tried to get away. So, now, how will I know the location of the container van? You two are just stupid! You're deciding on your own. This time, make sure you'll do it right. If you can't do it right this time, I'll be the one to bury you both. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] - Hi! - How are you? - How are you? - How are you? - Hello there! - Jane! - How are you? - Carla! I'm okay, I'm fine. - Hi, how are you? - Jonggo. - Maybel, you look good. - Doc? Is that you? Yes, who else? De Jesus! Is he your boyfriend? No, just a friend. [SPEAKING LOCAL DIALECT] Well, Maybel, this is for you. I know you can never afford this because you're poor. You know, Leverato, you haven't changed a bit. Keep it! I'm sure I can't even pawn it. You're still arrogant until now. Marissa! - Tina? - Hey, Maybel. - How are you? - How are you? You look sexy. - I already have three children. - Really? But you're still sexy though. - You haven't changed a bit. - This is Eugene. Eugene? You're still problematic until now? [SQUEALS, CHUCKLES] What's up, Marissa? Who is he? Your boyfriend? No, I picked him up on the streets. I don't know where I should take him so I just brought him with me. Something is wrong with him, but I don't know what. He doesn't look retarded. He's autistic. Oh, so he's original. That's authentic, dude. Anyway, autistic people, they live in their own world. The common term for this is... - Idiot savant. - What is an idiot savant? Idiot savant is the scientific term for those who are useless. They don't know anything in general life but in one particular talent, they're extraordinary. We just don't know what is the talent of... - Bullet! - Bullet. - Eat. - What? - I'll eat. - You want to eat? I'm hungry. And we have a special request. From Bullet. Why are you still single? I'm not thinking about marriage right now. I prioritize my work. I'll save first. And you know, I want to help a lot of people. Bullet? A country full of awesomeness Saint for fighting the war An insect flew A Japanese threw away An American ran A Filipino won - [CHEERING, APPLAUDING] - He's good! Alright! Thank you! Bullet, that's enough. Let's go. Good! Good! - Good, good. One more! - Doc, we'll go ahead. - Come on, Bullet. - Thank you! Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, really! Welcome! Gosh. You're lucky I won't argue with you. Rey! Rey! Rey! - What's happening? Who's that? - Rey! Rey! - Stop the car! - Yeah, okay. Rey! Rey! Bullet! Where did you put it? Let's go home, dad is looking for me. We can't go home yet, we need that. - Let's go home. - We need to show that to Uncle Piping. Let's go home, dad is looking for me. - You're stubborn. - Let's go home. - Listen to me. - Dad is looking for me. Hey, Bullet! Please. Don't be like that. - How can we go home? - Let's go home. Would you please stop fighting? What are you looking for? Because he was carrying a video camera with him yesterday when we got separated. Gosh. Is that it? The video camera is behind the television. Get it and stop arguing, okay? I will take you home. - [PHONE RINGING] - Let's go home. Dad is looking for me. Let's go home. Hello? Who's this? This is Ferdie. I called, because I missed you. It's too early for that. Ferdie, I'm going to be late. You'll be absent again? You're also absent yesterday. No. It's because I've found two kids. I let them stay here last night. I'll just send them home. Two kids? Miss Maybel, it's not here. Look for it! It's there. I mean no. One kid and a man who's acting like a kid. Describe them to me. I mean... Did you let them stay the night? They might be thieves. No, they don't look like that. They're good. I found the man under the bridge. And the kid who happens to be his friend, I found in Makati. According to them, there are people who are after them. So, I let them stay. Do they have a video camera? Yes. How did you know that? Maybel, stay in your pad. Hello? Ferdie? Finish it right away, so I can send you home. I'll just change. Yes. Who took that video? Miss Maybel, you're with the police, right? Maybe you can help us. [MUG SHATTERS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Bullet! Rey! Hurry! We're leaving. Bullet, let's go! [GUNS FIRING] Listen. Shoot them! Hurry, get down. Come on, hurry. Hurry! Go to the front. We'll take this way. Go! Let's go. Hurry! Hurry! Move aside! What is that, sir? What happened there? Sir? What happened? Sir. Get the car! Sir... what about my house? I'll stay here. Miss Maybel, let's give the gun to Bullet. BOTH: What? Rey, does he know how to use a gun? He's good at it! He's a champion! - Are you sure? - No! Here, Bullet. Bullet, shoot them. No! I promised my mom that I will never kill a person. You will not kill them. Just shoot their car. So, they would stop following us. We need to make them stop. Please, Bullet, you need to shoot. If not they will kill us! Please, Bullet. Shoot them! Please! Bullet, please don't embarrass me. Bullet, please. Rey, are you sure he knows how to use it? Yes, he's good at it. Champion Bullet! Go ahead, don't embarrass me. Slow down. Slow down. Wait, you said his father went to the police station? Yes, boss. For sure the address is still there. That's for sure, boss. Get closer to Joel. Hurry up! Joel! - Take care of them. - What is it, Ferdie? I will do something so they will surrender. Alright! After them! Bullet, hurry up! [EXPLODING] Bullet! Miss Maybel, stop the car! Bullet fell off the car. Let's go, bro. [EXPLODING] [HUMMING] Bullet, get in, hurry! Miss Maybel, did you know that Bullet won the National Shooting Fest? When? The other day. He defeated Jethro Dionisio. Really? Yes. My mom said, people like Bullet are heaven-sent. There's a reason why Bullet is good at shooting. So, he can defend himself. He's even better than a normal man. How good is he? He can hit all of his targets. He doesn't miss. By the way, Rey, in the video... I think I saw the Japanese get near you before he was killed. What did he tell you? Nothing, but he gave me something. What is that? Where? It's just here. Wait. This. This key is that important? That they need to kill that Japanese? [CAR APPROACHING] Sir, you know, I think this is the car. - Ouch! - You just had an accident and now you speak in English? Let's go! [METAL CLATTERS] Hurry up! Look for them. Come out, we're not gonna hurt you. Stay here no matter what. Rey, and you, Bullet! Bullet? Bullet? [GUNSHOTS] Where's Bullet? What did I tell you? Stay here. I'm staying. - I'm just fixing my seat. - Stay put. Boss, hide. Boss, he's a sharpshooter. Bullet? What's wrong with you? I told you to stay. Why did you leave? A sharpshooter? He's really good, boss. - He did that to us. - Ouch! You're siding with him. Boss, he's really good. Alright, call your son. Bullet, son! - Dad? - Don't come out! Whatever happens, don't come out! Did you hear me? - Dad! Dad! - Bullet? - Dad! - Bullet! - Bullet, please, don't go there. - My dad. They will kill you. That's my dad. Go after them! [COUGHING] - Were you the one who coughed? - Not me. He's here again. I won't fight anymore. You do it. Alright, good decision. [GROANS] What now, boss? Should I go around them? It's just a woman and a guy. Hide yourself. The guy is good at shooting. I wonder if he can shoot this, boss? Here. You're right, boss. Stupid. I just said that. Bullet! Bullet! Fire at me now! If you won't come out, your dad will die! - Dad. - I will count to 3. - Dad. - One! Two! Dad? Christmas is here... You gave us a hard time. This tape. Burn it. - Dad! - This one. Throw him. - Dad!

So, are you okay now? Feeling better? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Are you feeling better now? - Yes. - [CHUCKLES] Come on. We just need to follow one person-- General Solis. I'm sure he's the mastermind. Ferdie and Joel are his henchmen. There, we'll know what this is about. Open your mouth. Antibiotic, you need this. I don't have time to wait. I'll give you three days. If you haven't found the container van by then, forget about the deal. Why, Guchi san? Don't you trust me anymore? It's not like that... but I can't stay for long here in the Philippines. Guchi. Here in the Philippines, I can take care of you. I'll just give you three days. Beyond that, let's just forget about the deal. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Why? What happened? [GUNSHOTS] No, no. - No, no. - What's inside that container van? I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea. What's inside that container van? I don't know. You can't fool us. Alright! Open your mouth! What did you say? I know you'll talk. What's inside that container van? Drugs. I can't trust anyone anymore. And I was thinking... you're the perfect person for this kind of job. You're smart and you know that you can trust me to do this job. That Japanese has a business he's been attending to. Before he was killed by Ferdie and Joel. He used to go to that place. His wife has a locker room in there. Don't worry. If I have to check the entire place, I will. - Bullet. - Hmm? General's van is right there. - So, what do I care if his van is-- - What's wrong with you? Listen to me! I'm sure that his henchmen are here. We'll know the meaning of that key. I see! So what? Bullet, stay here. Don't leave. If you leave, I'll hurt your hand. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMEN CHATTERING] Hey, let's go. Stop it. The key is with me. [GUNSHOTS] - Come on! Hurry up! - Hurry! [WOMEN CLAMORING] Move aside! Get down! Chris, cover me. Let's get out! - Hurry! Get out! - Come on. Wow! This is a lot of sugar. Bullet, these are not sugar. What? So, this is a lot of flour. Those are drugs, Bullet. But this is too much. Bravo! So, I just need to follow you. Well, you've always been a good officer. You really learned a lot from me. Bravo, Maybel! Bravo! Holy Moses! Boys! It's a payday! [MEN CHEERING] General, sports car? Looks like you it's a lot of drugs. How about us? You fooled us, General! You said it's a sports car. What do you think of us? Rats, that is contented with a little cheese? Those are not for you! - Bullet. hey, Bullet. - What? Gun. Gun? Oh! Now! [GUNS FIRING] Thank you. Bullet, stay here. Whatever happens, stay by my side. Stay alert, I'm sure they will go after us. You again? - Dad! - Colonel? You have the right to remain silent. Dad. Your son is really stubborn. Move! Dad. He almost shot me. - Ouch. - Joel, are you okay? I'm fine, Ferdie! Make sure not to expose any part of your body. I know that! But before they can kill me... This guy will die first! Bullet! Put down your gun! Enough! We will surrender! Just don't hurt him. Don't kill him. He's innocent. Bullet! Watch this! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! This is my dad. Dad. Dad! Wake up! Dad, wake up. Wake up, dad. Colonel? - Colonel! - Dad! - Is my dad still alive? - Yes, he's still alive, Bullet. Walk! Hurry! Wait. Slowly, slowly. You're holding me like gays. Go inside! Hurry! Good thing you're safe. Wait, son. Did you fulfill your promise? Yes, mom. I didn't kill anyone. It's the lady who fought. I followed your instructions. So, that means you're the hero here, Bullet. Those bad guys are no match for you. - Of course, that's Bullet the champion. - Excuse me. - Wait. You forgot about the father. - Out of the way. You forgot about the father. I was the one who taught him that. Piping, you're severely wounded yet you're still arrogant. Just let him be, comrade. But he needs to know that I was the one who taught him that. So, that means, I am the best. Mayor, I've seen how you shoot. I know you can't. That I don't know. Who's Bullet? Who here is Bullet? Why? My son is innocent. We just want to invite him to the precinct. Just to answer some questions. Alright, chief, I'll bring him in. Alright, lieutenant. Just wait for us here. Let's go Sargeant. Bullet, I'm grateful that I've met you. I've learned a lot from you. If not to for you, I would most likely be dead by now. Killed by those thugs. Thank you. I hope we're not born differently. Why? Are you abnormal? You know, Bullet, I can never forget you. Thanks, again. Thanks again. Another take. ... Action! Thanks again. - [BULLET MOANING] - [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Bullet, what's wrong? [LAUGHING] Action! Thanks again. Another one. Thanks again. Bullet, what's happening to you?
