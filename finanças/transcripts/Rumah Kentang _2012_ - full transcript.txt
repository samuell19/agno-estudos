What were you doing just now? I was doing a ritual to see the supernatural world. The ritual has to be done at midnight, like right now. So we can see them right away. And there are two other ways to see supernatural beings. First, looking back from between our legs,... ...we will definitely see them. And the second way, play Jelangkung. Do you guys know that this house I rented is... ...the mysterious potato house? You often smell potato, and they say there are spirits... ...among us here. I don't believe in silly stories like that. This is not a silly story, this is a legend. Hillbillies legend! -I'm serious. Sabrina, enough! Stop trying to scare us. Windha, this is real. Sab, if you want to scare us, why don't you just... ...summon those spirits? Here, use Jelangkung. After all, we're here to play Jelangkung. And you have done that ritual. So, no need for those bogus stories. Here, prove it Okay. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. What was that? Hes coming. Sabrina. Sabrina. Got you! Such cowards! You said you weren't scared of my story. You're annoying! -Oh come on, Buddy. I was only shaking the curtain. Yes, but it wasn't funny! It was. It was funny to see all your scared faces. Not funny at all! You made me pee my pants! He wet his pants! -I'll get you both for this! Lets go home! -Let's go back. All right then, I'm going to go home now. No, why? Its midnight, my mom and dad are expecting me. Come on, don't pout. Yes, all right. -But you're not afraid... ...to sleep alone tonight, are you? With your mom and dad out of town. Yes, of course not. I am not a coward. Thats my girl. All right, I'm going home. Good night. -Good night. Hello. -Hi, honey, what are you up to? Hey you, I just finished showering. How come you're still not asleep? You better watch out, you're sleeping alone. Your parents are not home. Watch out, behind you! Jodi, cut it out! But seriously, I've just read on the internet,... ...it seems that the legend of potato house is true. Jodi sweetheart, since when are you the scared type? It's written here that if the doorbell rings,... ...don't ever open the door. If theres no one there, it means you have invited... ...that spirit to your house and it will bring danger... ...to the people in the house. Plus, you have just played Jelangkung. Jodi, we were just playing and messing around. And one more thing, its also written here that if you smell... ...potato and you hear the sound of a frying pan... ...frying some potatoes, it means you must run immediately. Especially, if you hear a boy crying. Sabrina! My doorbell rang, but no one is here. Sabrina. Sab! Hello? 3 years later. Hello? Yes, aunty? The doctor said that Rika is still in shock... ...because of your mothers death. They were in the same car. The accident happened because... ...they tried to avoid another car. I don't have any other choice, Arman. But you only have one semester left, Farah. Its a waste if you quit now. But I don't have money to continue college... ...and my younger sister is alone here. Shes not well, I can't leave her here alone. Farah, you're still studying in Melbourne,... ...you're not supposed to stay in Jakarta. I can't go back there. -Okay. So now you are going to live in the house that your mom rented? Yes, but the lease is almost over. I can't afford to extend the lease. The rent is not cheap. I want to move out from... ...this place, and live somewhere else. Then where are you going stay? Your mother passed away but she didn't leave you with nothing. She left something for you. A house? Its your mothers house, its in Dharmawangsa. She bought that house about ten years ago. Even though it was not a new house, she was interested because... ...its in a good neighbourhood and she bought it for investment. Now that house is yours. The house was put up for sale several times,... ...but nobody actually bought it. It was rented out three years ago, but it was only temporary... ...because there was an incident. But why did mom rented a house instead of living in her house? Your mom believed the rumour... ...that the house is haunted. Rumour has it that the house is the potato house. Potato house? The street vendors who passed the house often smell potato... ...coming from there, and the house is clearly empty. Rika, will you help me pack? Rika, we don't have any other options. We have to move out. The story about the potato house is just a rumour. You don't have to be scared, okay? Yes, and I have requested for the electricity to be turned on,... ...and why is it still off? When? Please don't be too long, because if we don't have... ...electricity, I won't have water in my house. As soon as possible, please. Thank you. Rika. Rika, the door is still locked. -I will look for the key first. Now, lets go see your room upstairs. Come on. The view is overlooking the backyard, do yo like it? Rika, we're only here temporarily. This house is too big for the two of us. The maintenance is also costly. I have tried to get a job in some companies, but its hard... ...for them to accept someone who hasn't finished college. I still need more time to find a job. So we will sell this house. We will buy a smaller house once this house is sold. That way we'll have some savings and you can also re-enrol... ...in your school. Our things are here. I will clean the house first and then we'll start putting it up... ...for sale. Why won't you let me open the door? Rika. Rika, I've prepared a meal for you. Please eat it, okay? Rika. Rika, will you help me clean that side over there? What do you want for dinner? Don't eat too much French Fries, okay? You already had French Fries last night. You got to eat something healthy. You were the one who ate it, weren't you? I didn't it eat, he finished it all. Yes, its a certificate of ownership, everything is complete. Please put it up for sale today. We'll have open house every day. Farah, can I sleep here? Rika, whats wrong? Can you smell it? What is this smell? The generator is out, I will turn it on. We are not alone. I will turn it on. Wait here. Rika. Rika, come out. Don't be scared, it was nothing. The kitchen door downstairs was opened. It turns out theres another kitchen in the back,... ...but the kitchen door was locked yesterday, and I couldn't find... ...the key. How come I could open it just now? Was the door just stuck? But the windows were opened. Maybe its because of the wind. There was this weird smell, the smell of potatoes,... ...and the kitchen is really dirty, I'll clean it tomorrow. Rika, what are you thinking about? He came out, but then he disappears. Lost in your thoughts? -No. Do you know any good psychiatrist but not too costly around here? I don't know about that, miss. Whats the matter? My younger sister is still in shock after the death... ...of our mom and she doesn't want to talk,... ...and when she does talk she says weird things. She said its not just me and her in this house,... ...but theres someone else. Your sister has sixth sense. People who can see what other people might not see. Like a supernatural world. My sister doesn't have that ability. Are you sure, miss? People say this house is... ...the potato house. Anyway, I'm done here. I'll check the inside. The electricity is running, the lights are on, water pump is... ...functional, but leave it on, so the water will be clean after... ...some time. -Thank you, sir. Miss, having a sixth sense... ...can be a blessing or a curse. If someone can't control this ability, it will complicate... ...his or her life. About spirits, there are good and bad spirits. Bad spirits will do harm to human, so we must handle them carefully. Good day, miss. Rika. I am going out, okay? I want to activate the phone line in this house. Also I am going to the supermarket. The electricity is running, now we can keep food in the fridge. I'll buy you dinner for tonight. Please don't stay out too late, I am scared. Nothing will happen in this house. I've locked all the doors and windows, so you don't need... ...to worry. I will be home pretty late because of the traffic. Just wait for me, okay? Rika, can you get the plates? Rika. Rika. Rika. Rika! Rika! Theres an injury in this part that caused internal bleeding. This is the reason for her losing consciousness,... ...and fell into a coma. When will she regain consciousness, doctor? We can't predict that because shes still in a critical condition. What are her chances of surviving this? We will do our best for Rika. There are many bruises on her body, many scratch marks,... ...someone obviously attacked her. I have written a report and I have notified the police. Theres no sign of force entry in this house. Are you sure you have locked all the doors and windows? And theres nothing missing. Yes, but it looks like someone trashed the living room,... ...the guest room, and this room. Three years ago something strange happened in this same house. What do you mean, officer? Have you heard story about this house being the potato house? Yes, but I don't really believe it. Yes, this story is quite irrational,... ...but three years ago a woman named Sabrina died mysteriously... ...in this house. Her boyfriend said she did a ritual that night. She placed five candles in the middle of a table,... ...then she combed her hair five times and she looked... ...straight to the mirror. People say this ritual can work for those who don't have sixth sense... ...but once you did this ritual you can't undo it forever. Although, there is no proof to all of this. Okay, we will further investigate this, if there is... ...anything feel free to contact us, we will assist you... ...anyway we can. Thank you, Officer. Okay. Little boy, little boy. Help! Help! Please leave me alone! Leave! I beg you, please leave! Leave! You were right, Rika. We are not alone in that house. The story about the potato house is true. This is the house, honey. Dharmawangsa 9 number 120. Honey, this house is huge. Nice, pretty, lets go inside, honey. I am curious. Hello. -No doorbell, honey? Excuse me. Good afternoon, hello. I have called here yesterday. We've made an appointment, right? I want to see the house, can we do that now? I'm sorry, ma'am, this house is not for sale yet. I have to resolve some problems regarding this house first. I will call you back. -Oh, you can't do that, miss. We're absolutely sure that we want to move to this house... ...since we talked on the phone. Right, honey? Come on. We'll increase the price if we have to. Right. Come. But..... -Lets just look inside. Oh, this is beautiful, honey. Its huge. Heres the table. The sofa is also nice. The colour combination is also good. The sofa is so comfy. Come sit with us, miss. Its her house, honey. -This is so beautiful. Why don't you go sunbathe with the fish, honey? Honey, you're so funny. What is this room? -Its the back kitchen, sir. Its locked. -So we are not allowed to see it? How about we see the bedrooms? Its okay, right? The bedrooms? Sorry, sir, ma'am, but right now, the main bedroom... ...is not available for you to see. When I resolved the problems, I will call you and you can see... ...the room. -Problems? Whats with all these problems? We just want to see, if we think this house is right for us... ...then we will move here. -Yes. Come on miss, just forget the problems. Come. Don't be shy. I have other rooms. I will show you other rooms. Wow, this is beautiful. It is so spacious. The windows are so big and because its so big,... ...if you start from that side it will be dusk by the time... ...we reach there. So many rooms also, we can rent it out. Is this it? A little hot. You haven't turn on the AC, have you? Yes, but this is suitable. Nice. Suitable for our daughter. You like it, don't you? But anyway, people say this house is the potato house. Honey, Hurry! Ghost! Sir! Sir! Hello? Can I request for a deduction on the fee? May I talk to the head of hospital administration? All the hospital bills have been paid. I will pay for future bills. Don't worry about it, okay? I will pay you back in instalments, Arman. When I have the money. -You don't have to, Farah. I must, Arman. You've spent all of your money for my sister Rika. I must pay you back. We've been together for three years and we're in... ...a serious relationship. When your sister got sick, it became my responsibility too. Please don't refuse. I have tried calling you several times, I became worried,... ...and so I immediately booked a flight home. I'm sorry. I put my phone on silent,... ...and it was a private number. I didn't know it was you. I'm sorry, I got the phone settings wrong. Hey. I don't know who else to turn to, Arman. Its all piling up, my moms death,... ...financial problems, Rikas condition,... ...and the problems with this house. I really don't know what to do. Whats wrong with this house? I am trying to sell this house. That way I can buy a smaller house, and I would have some savings... ...for myself and Rika, but its difficult to sell... ...this house. This house is the potato house. I didn't realize it at first, but Rika always says... ...strange things about this house. It turns out Rika has a sixth sense and she can see... ...all the strange things in this house. I don't have a sixth sense, so I tried a ritual,... ...and I can see that thing, Arman. I wanted to know why Rika is in her condition right now. Farah, you haven't slept all night. You're burning up. Your face is pale. You are having a fever. You're exhausted. You are in shock because of all your problems. This is all too sudden, too hard. I am not tired Arman, and I'm not in shock. I am not under stress. My cousin was in shock once because his parents died suddenly. Since then he often sees things that aren't real. Like having a hallucination. -I am not hallucinating, Arman. I am not crazy. -No one said you're crazy. If he can hurt Rika, it means he can hurt me too, Arman. Don't be too far from me. Yes. You will always stay with me, won't you? At first I don't feel right staying at your house,... ...because theres only the two of us here,... ...but with your condition, I will stay here until you get... ...better. -Thank you. Hot, hot, hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Go back to sleep, okay? Whats wrong? He pulled me! Theres no one here! He was there, he pulled my legs. It hurts. Hello? Yes? Hey. The frying pan. Rika, Rika, Rika! Nurse! Hello? So Rika has lost consciousness again? Its okay. No problem. Its better for you to stay... ...in the hospital. Yes, okay. What happened? You have to move out from this house immediately! I don't have any other place to go other than this house, Arman. We'll go to Surabaya. You can live with my parents. I can't leave Rika. We'll transfer Rika to a hospital in Surabaya. We can't transfer her in her current condition. Also, I have to sell this house. I can buy a new house if this house is sold,... ...and I will have money for Rikas medication, also I'll... ...have some savings for me and Rika. Yes, but no one wants to buy this house. This house has been up for sale for years now,... ...but not many people are interested. We must ask this spirit to leave this house. Then people will be interested, someone will buy it. We have to contact a shaman. Hello, good afternoon, Mr. Hadi? Yes sir, I need your help to get rid of a spirit. Yes, sir, right away. Mr. Hadi! Mr. Hadi? Yes. -Come on in, sir. Farah, this is Mr. Hadi. Let me work, wait outside. -Okay, sir. How did it go? This house is haunted. Its a spirit of a boy. He died unnaturally in this house. He doesn't want to leave, he refused. I can't force him to leave. You have to leave this house, or you'll end up hurt. What you've seen is just the beginning. You have to leave immediately. I am sorry, I must leave. He doesn't like me being here. Good day. We must find another shaman. Its no use. We must communicate directly with that boys spirit. We'll ask him, why did he hurt me, you and Rika? Why does he want us to leave this house instead of him leaving? Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Jelangkung oh Jelangkung, we're having a small party. Come without us bringing you in, leave without us bringing you back. Farah, are you okay? That boy, he used to live in this house. The maid was irritated with him. She pushed him into a frying pan which was boiling potatoes... ...at that time. The maid was scared she would get caught, shes afraid to go to jail. So she stirred the boy inside... ...the pan until it became a potato soup. Then she served the potato soup to the whole family. Even now they don't know what happened to their boy. They don't even know that they have eaten him up. Thats why his spirit haunts this house,... ...because he died violently He doesn't want to leave this house... ...because to him this is his house. He doesn't like whoever is trying to stay in this house. He doesn't like that, thats why he haunts us... ...to make us leave this house. Whoever comes and stays in this house,... ...he will not like it,... ...because to him, people who come to this house are evil... ...like his maid. If we don't leave this house, he will kill us. The potato smell is gone. You said he died inside the frying pan. Yes, the frying pan in the kitchen. Every time we smell potato that frying pan starts to cook... ...by itself, and the boy appears. He died inside the frying pan, it must be that frying pain. Yes, thats right. Rika did mention that frying pan. Yes, and no one has treated him decently, thats why his spirit... ...haunts this house. People who died unnaturally and treated indecently,... ...their spirits will never be at peace. We have to bury that frying pan. Come on. We have to check that frying pan. That frying pan will never return, Farah. Farah? The frying pan. We have to throw it away as far as we can. The boy thinks this is his house, because the frying pan he died... ...in is still in this house. Wherever we throw away the pan, wherever we move it,... ...if its still in this house, it will return to the kitchen. The boys spirit will continue to haunt the house, but if... ...we throw it away far from this house, his spirit will stop... ...haunting anyone. Taxi! I will take shower first. Later I will cook dinner for you. What is it Farah? -Nothing. Lets go downstairs. Farah, don't worry about it, everything is going to be okay. That frying pan never returned back, that boys spirit... ...is in peace. No more strange things happening in this house. How about if we go out for dinner? That way you won't feel stress for having to stay at home... ...all the time, okay? Thats my girl. When was the last time we ate outside like this? Last month. We ate at a restaurant by the ocean. That time you asked the violinist to play our favourite song,... ...but it was the wrong song. Then you ordered my favourite meal, but it didn't taste good,... ...and when you're about to pay, it turned out you didn't bring... ...your wallet. You tried to be romantic, but everything went wrong. Hopefully it won't happen again. Its embarrassing. Yes, you know I am not a romantic person. I was just trying to be romantic. Right now I am also trying to be a little bit romantic. Hopefully I won't fail again. Farah, we have been together for a long time and we both know... ...we're serious with our relationship. I can see my future with you. After Rika regain consciousness, and you have sold your house,... ...and after Rika graduates, maybe you can bring Rika... ...to Melbourne and live with me. You can continue college and I would have a job. Will you marry me? I have carried this around in my pocket for a month. I have always been looking for the right moment to say this... ...to you. I don't know if this is the right moment,... ...but I feel that I have to say it now. Farah, will you be my wife? Yes, I will. Typical you, you are always unable to act romantic. I love you. I love you too. Hello? Yes, thank you. Who was it? Hello? Okay, I'll be right there. And who was that? I'll tell you about it later, we have to go to the hospital now. Rika has just regained consciousness. Okay, let's go. We will move from that house soon. A potential buyer has called me. He is serious about buying our house. You don't have to be scared anymore. You can return to school. Arman, he proposed to me. After you got better, and we sold the house,... ...you can return to school. And after you graduate you can come to Melbourne... ...to live with me. You want that, don't you? Don't be afraid, that boys spirit is in peace. He will never haunt us and anyone else ever again. Arman and I have thrown that frying pan to the sea. You don't have to be afraid or worried. From now on, we can live our life peacefully. Thank you, sir. We will empty this house within a few days. Very well. In that case, please excuse us. Rika, we'll start packing tomorrow. After that we'll start looking for a new house. That frying pan is back. Arman! Arman! Arman! We are out of that house. We are safe. We are safe. Lets leave this place. We are safe, Rika. We are far away from the house. We have made a mistake. A mistake? He doesn't like it when the frying pan is far away... ...from the house. To him it means that we kicked him out from his own house. Hes really angry. It can't be. We've thrown away that frying pan. He can't harm us anymore. He can only come out from that pan and only in that house. We are outside of that house. We are not in that house anymore. Rika. We're going back to the house. No. Don't come out, hes waiting for us outside. I love you. I love you too.
