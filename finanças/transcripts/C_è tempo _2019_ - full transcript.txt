If I think about what I wanted from my little girl Pearl Vita ... I was wrong to follow your dreams. They were not dreams but crap. Should I apologize alia girl who was because I have disappointed, and because of you. You should apologize to me. And then in Rome were saying the same things. "The city is close to me, I want to go Via" "I need space, I need my air pearl creativity." You know what is the truth? You do not is never anything good. I wanted to go to Paris, and you knew that was what I was hoping. I went because of you, because you did not want to go there. You are attached to the things you do, and no one ever wanted to this nonsense! You're not a teacher, you're a bastard! Yes, I'm a bastard. 11're married a bastard, but did you know! Cazzarola. Go, Stefano, go. Good morning. "Hello"? "Good morning". - "Guten Morgen." - Forget it. - I'm italian. - Thank goodness, because I fi nished languages. Beautiful drudgery! Want some water?

And a bright pink, but the picture is good if you put there. - Listen to me, her and Stefano Orsoni? - Yes why? They are the notary Lolotta Cortona. - Lolotta? - Yup. I need to talk. Feel that happened to me this morning. I go to the mirror, I had to check something. At some point he get a chick dressed in ridiculous fashion. It looked like a candy with heels. him, thinking it was the usual tourist, attack throughout the explanation, Viganella, the mirror, etcetera. Instead, after a while ', I discovered that it is a notaia. He came all the way from Rome to tell me that the inseminator died. What inseminator? The asshole who knocked up my mother and then ran off. - That is your father? - Do not call him father. In fact, do not call at all. She tried to tell me the name, but I stopped her, out of respect to my mother that I did not ever tell. But it's a shame, it would have been an opportunity. To do what? I believe that many of your problems arise from the fact that you never knew who your father was. What problems do I have? It does not seem to have problems. - Well ... - What has my father with this? In short, the notaia he wanted from you? Why did you come looking for you? By Way of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide killed both, husband and wife, at night, in their hut in the Dolomites. I understand, but you wanted? These two left a son, a boy of 13 years, alone. No relatives, no friends. In his will, it says that the person appointed as guardian I am. - You? But if you do not know you! - Exactly, it's crazy, I tell you. - What did you say? - What do claws have said?

Why do you talk about money? Because they offered me a small sum, is not that one does free tutor. - What would be this small amount? - 100,000 euro. 100.000 euro! In the situation where we have re fi utato 100,000 euro? Well...! - Are you nuts? - Are you crazy? Are you crazy? In a life of s fi ga it happens elo a stroke of luck you kick? Fortuna? In your luck and bear a child? You must take him to school, in the gym, on vacation, exanthematous diseases, measles ... Telo accolli you? Not if it bears no one goes to college. No, which college? The will is clear: no college. - The rules are very clear. - Well ... yes? Even mine are clear. You go to Rome tomorrow, you take it here elo ports. After a few days he'll beg to go to college. What happened to you? You've changed. What do you want to do? The peaks, do you? But no, it's a boy born in Rome, here it will never fit. 207 inhabitants, 30 km school, come on. On recalls this notaia. John, are you ready? The taxi waiting for you outside. Say It Is not he tell me it's not him. Stefano Orsoni? Giovanni Maggi? Revenue. And he. Cazzarola. Since you, Mr. Orsoni, the only relative in Life, Eva bears the burden to provide assistance and care to John fi no to 18 years. YUP. We are sure that you are 13? It's not that you drop the age? The accused has asked me a question, I have to answer only to her, right? Defendant? Mica are charged! Your Honor, objection. "Objection," "defendant", "Your Honor," we are not in an episode of "Perry Mason." Indeed. What you have to answer only the questions of the judge I learned from "The Night Of" I do not know if you saw it. Yes, I have views and I loved it. If you like the genre, watched "Law & Order". You have fi nished? It's not that I wanted to raise a debate on the television series. I just asked how old this bonsai. The child, John, 13 years old, and would I please be more respectful. She and your brother has suffered immense pain. Excuse me, but who knows this nano high? And least of his father, who you claim to be well mine. That knocked my mother and ran like a cheetah. If you can, the pain is not only his, but mine. In one fell swoop I discovered a dead father and a 13 year old brother alive than I accollarmi. He realizes that in the hands fi nisco? This gentleman should become my guardian, but has seen him? - You Because You? - In effect it does not show up well. It also puts her? But he is a good person, and does a job ... I make two. Indeed, two showing great social and ecological sensitivity. "Pija 'sti spicci". His wife, who will take care of you, is a quiet woman and staid. - Yes. - It's in my rights re fi utarmi? I'm not good with their Baloo. You can call me Baloo! The law is equal for all. If I do not call it nano high he can not call Baloo. - There is no alternative? - Yes, there is an alternative: the college. You must ensure a standard of living adequate to John. YUP. A Room of him, proper meals, studies, sport. - John, which sport? - The paddle courts. That practice Grumpy? Which is? Okay, sorry. Anyway, speaking of questions ... Now I do not know if it's the right time nor the place, because ... That question dell'appannaggio ... The 100,000 euro Babycare pearl. Now is "the baby"? Before I was "bonsai", "the dwarf high," "Grumpy". So it only does peri money! He felt, I fi no two days ago did not even know you existed. If I do this thing, and I do, I have to have the means to do so. I make such a bunch, I do two jobs to get to end the month. You have inherited, from what would my father well, a lot of money. I also think it right that this lot of money I use to raise him, for him to play "pans" and what they need. To see the fi lm, that sucks, look. Scusi. He intended to demonstrate his poverty alia judge? With this maximum we get to Piazza Mazzini, if not kin before. "Dude," this is like a train. If you do not like, go walk much with your legs make it. Let's make one thing clear. If you're going to break the balls for the whole trip, I prefer to give up the money but I'll take in college. In fact, I'll take you to Guantanamo. She is aware that any mistreatment inform Ia judge? He gave me his phone number and he told me to call sele things do not go. One word and "Guantamano" we defines her. More than 100,000 Euros. He is alleprato. Get in the car, come on. What did you say? No, I have not spoken. One thing very important, crucial. What team are you? They Are Juventus. You seemed. And she? For those fans? Give me of you, otherwise I will anxiety. I can not make it. Someone like me, you think of what team can be? I think she is Lazio. Get off. On these important things you do not mess. You Juventus have you troubled childhood. If a referee, which I'm not saying the complex marital Vicende, had not canceled a very regular goal Turone, in 1981, the Roma would Won the championship and the history of Italian football would be completely different. I was six, I was never resumed. Some say that they are well greased for this trauma. Turone was offside, it is shown. Now can we go? Thank you. No. YUP. Then, I take a lasagne, beautiful generous, stuffed pig, always nice abundant, as a starter and a nice platter of cold meats ... Abundant? You want to keep light? What are you laughing, Chinese? But look at this. Well? Did you decide? You're putting a century. His son can not choose? It is not my son. A moment to decide, right? Yes, for a moment, I'm thinking. Just a moment. Cinà, you can come back in three or four minutes. I'm sorry but the kitchen is closing. So no, I do not eat anything. So I can not choose, we will never succeed. What is this?

Get the documents eli by the agent, please? - If you give me a moment to look for them. - Yup. - And his son? - No. - How come you travel together? - Because he's my brother. - It would be my brother. - or would it? And my brother, but I only discovered a few days. Until a few days ago she did not know she had a brother? Exact. Why does it call ... How come it is his brother there dates of her? Of her? The little boy is told: "If you give me time to look for." Why me of her? Give me of you. Because if you have two brothers different surnames? Why? Because if you are inhabited brothers in two different municipalities? - Why? - You have to make me talk. - Speak. - Calmly. - It's hot? - It's hot. I also fi no to this morning I did not know that this man was my brother. - Yeah. - Imagine my excitement. But I have court papers that can confirm and explain everything. Here it is. We have the time to look at the court papers? - We have time. - Like hell. Did you understand? - You see? Everything was fine for me. - See you then. Although, I can say? It seems to me the boy's older brother. - No offense. - No. - Come on, Chinaglio on! See you later. - I followed everything. I was in contact with the Central, we were about to snap the blitz with ROS. - You risked. - How so? - Joke! - You make me take shots. - What line you are! - Lenza. - Come on, Chinaglio. - Chinaglio is the name of oil last? Chinaglio is the name, because the father was a great Lazio. He too is, and I too. It's' see, it's your time. - Very. - Do not pass anyone, fast! Or. OK Bye. - Ah, I see with my eyes. - What did I do? Here we have a small car full of wolves. - cubs. - Yup. - He's got with Lazio? - No. - you still want to purge? - No, indeed, look. I have always maintained that Lazio is a magni fi ed team. Indeed, we Romans we should all be united against the common enemy who are these thieves Juventus. - My fi èjuventino son. - His son. - huge. - huge. - But really? - Here we go. I can go? How do you figure that stop do not work looking at the car from the front? So they made me pinned chosen. We enter the same side? Every day the same story for 20 years? Then you say, "Why did I pinned chose?" The air conditioning works? - No no? Yes, Luciana? Yes, we have clarified with the judge. But I wanted to say one thing. I wanted to tell you... You make me talk? Well, if ... He heard, there is the police, I have to attack, if not make me fine. I'll call you, hello. What a bore. - The country is called Viganella? - Yes why? - Calculating the distance. - We're not even going to Viganella. I have to make a conference in Rimini, not I told? - No, no one told me. - All right. A conference, do you? - No kidding? - But really? Look who come from all over the world to listen. They are a leading authority in my subject. What would be his subject? I am responsible for the National Research Council study of rainbows in Italy. It 'a little' you. - The study of what? - Of rainbows. They come from all over the world to hear her talking about rainbows? - Exactly. - The world is full of crazy people. Instead of saying crap, you ever been to Rimini? No. Where did you go to the beach? There have been only three times. All Mauritius, Oman e all Seychelles. "Me cojoni". Passoscuro from the child, maximum Fiumicino. Of course it's incredible. We had the same father, just that you did swim in the reef, I in marana. You will not incazzeresti? The first thing that happened at the restaurant, you can not choose. It only happens with food? No, it happens with everything, and I do not understand why. Because you're rich, you were born rich. The rich can always choose everything. What to buy, where to go on vacation, what to eat. him in my life I could never do that. I always had only one front door, never two. You can choose that you can not, and I would like that I can not. I noticed that you do not use social networks, why? I do not use them because they scare me. I have not heard. If we stop to sleep in a little place? So we arrive early morning in Rimini and maybe we can take a bath. Would your first swim in national waters. Okay, try on the internet, how many stars? But which star? Stables, if anything. I've already made arrangements with a friend who lives in San Casciano. And on the road, that is, almost, in fact. We sleep with her, so we save. Then it's not really a friend, is a former. I had a very long history with her. I will not deny that tonight maybe something ... Please just do not make me do embarrassing fi gures. I remind you also that she is a married man. Let me see: you are Juventus, six saputello, you're filthy rich and you're also a moralist? If you allow, with my ex I doing what I want. No, she is now my brother. "Now it is my brother" does a lot of laughter. However now I feel Michela we're coming. But pull over, do not you call while driving. My, my mom. Ciao! - How are you? - What surprises me do? How much time! - Hello. - Good evening. - He? -Then… I get it: you're gone all these years because you did a son. You do not say I wanted it because you were afraid that I would have scolded you, right? It's not from me. - Then life changes, you know? - I know. Here, in this regard, I would like you to meet the person who changed my. - So you've met one. - Not exactly. A. She is Natalie, and French but understands very well the Italian. After we broke up I realized that men are not for me. Too selfish, arrogant, pushy, empty. - I understood. - I could go on for hours. - But stopped. - "Bonsoir". - "Bonsoir". - After you've only been with women. - So ELA before. - And I discovered the wonders, yes. Indeed, you know that I have to thank for this? Michela, please. - I know it's not a compliment? - Shut up. - We want to come in? - Well. Here we go. - Saw what is beautiful? - You say? Honestly, no offense, I too with you two would choose her. Sembra Natalie Portman. Now you see a bit 'serious, but it is a fi lm fun. - Yes, of course. - you will laugh. - Well, hopefully. - Yup. - you will laugh. - Hopefully at the right times. Often the movies you can laugh in the dramatic moments. No, here we hope that everything is in place. The play took the virtue to observe more closely the reality. The Italian reality, the reality of the feelings, the reality of man, of his daily life and also his hopes and fantasies. He seems like a smart kid, friendly, polite. Yes a lot. But you do not look very happy. the children just do not ... - Do not hate them, then you know it. - Yes yes, I know. You have always escaped the idea of ​​a father. And then I have not had the courage to tell you. Which is what he did that guy with my mother. But at least I did before, not after like him. - What did you want me to say? - Let me in life I want to be alone. That perhaps is why I go out looking for rainbows, fi ngo to adjust a mirror on top of a mountain. Because I can not be with others, even when I like. How I liked you. So why did you get married? It may seem absurd, but not to be alone. I have never been accustomed to crossing my life with that of anyone. I was always alone. As a child, if I had a problem, I had to fix it on my own. Always. And then I like to be alone. The loneliness I do not like. Good night. But really? If you are eating! What have you done in the back? Nothing, they fell as a child. Past. No. No, help! Help! Help! No! Help, no! What's up? No! Help! What happens? Everything is alright. - Excuse me, Stephen. - Shh. You want me to make two steps? YUP. Come on. Everything is alright. But you told me: "Excuse me." You did it to me of you. Come here. What happened? You care to tell me? When did you stop being a child? There is a day, a precise, when you realize that it is infinite? I do not know. For me, maybe it was a day when I went to the zoo with my mother. I realized that I did not care nothing of monkeys, elephants. Oppure no. One day I heard the desire and the need to take a scooter and go. Having my means and traveling. And how was it? It was the best day of my Life. But there is time for you. There's time. Good people never really stop being children. I do not want it to happen. Everyone has always said that bigger look like my age. The head, of course. Maybe to be alone before it grows. Maybe when I grow up they will say the opposite. Then also you seem to me a little 'smaller than your age. And this I do not know if that's a compliment. But perhaps you, and that's okay. The people who never stop being children have a defect. You know what? And they never stop playing. - Staying children playing. - No! If you are in a field and at the bottom there is a pool, go to the pool and you jump in! Wait up. - Your father. - Yup? I've never seen. - Do you have a picture? - Yes, I have it in your suitcase. - But it's our father. - Yeah, all right. You have the same face, the same eyes and the same mouth. - I noticed it as soon as I saw you. - You say? Beautiful woman, your mother, much younger than him. Yes, 18 years less. Where did you here? Seychelles, Oman? - Actually, I Mauritius. - Sure. A five-star resort. Buffet unlimited. Animation all day. Life's good? Look who took me to all these beautiful places but they left me alone with the babysitter. Will I went swimming with Dad yes and no three times. But once there was a turtle. It was just us in the water. We swam with her plan. Dad told me: "Get his rhythm." It was wonderful. Let's go come on. Here we go? Come on. Mail ball drops? Excuse me, I have the baby a little 'hot. A Rainbow and Solero. I do not know what the Rainbow, give you two Solero. And give me two Solero. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What you wanted ice cream? - The Rainbow. I do not know him. I believe, and went out of production 30 years ago. So why do you ask? Why I wrote to Algida saying it was a serious mistake to remove it from the market marketing and I always hope that someday you rimettano. But what was so special about this rainbow? It was good, very good, then it was colorful. And then I remember one particular day. It's a good story? - I'll tell you? - Yup. - It gives me a Rainbow? - Immediately. - Then pay mom. - All right, Stephen. But really? Since then, life has changed completely, forever. "Ahò". - Are you enchanted? - No, no. No no! You had a fi danced? Yes, in fifth grade, but we left after a week. Why? What happened? - You wanted me to kiss. - Well! So? -I did not want to. - Why? Were you mad? No, it seemed a bit 'unhygienic. Were you mad. However a rainbow I've ever seen. Since I had one. "Movies do not forget." Here we go? We will find place, in your opinion? Do you want? - No thanks, I do not eat at the movies. - In order not to disturb others, I guess. He says here in this Fellini room, at my age, He saw a lot of fi lm every day. - FIG. - Think how nice. See if transmit "Pig Robot". First, it says "projected." Then, the fi lm is called "Jeeg". - Okay, is Equal. - It's not the same. Today, however, make "The first quiet night." It set here in Rimini. - Never heard. - I had no doubt. Look, there is also an exhibition of sacred art. So funny. And a concert at the Court of the Augustinians. Who sings? A girl, there's a photo: Simona Giannelli. Simona Giannelli! And fi chissima! So all the songs in memory! - Come on, take the tickets. - The fi lm? So then you project it to your home on television, let's go. But no, the fi lm ... The most beautiful thing to see here was the cinema. Watch the cinema, hello, beautiful, come on. We're going to buy tickets! It was your wife? But you you love her? What has this to do now? You seem to always annoyed when calling you. At first we had fun, always laughing, we were happy. It was fine. Then after the time he brought it boredom, it is deadly, and now we barely endure. My did not laugh much, but I think they got along pretty. Yes, it is not that it is for all the same thing, otherwise it would be easy. What do you say, gull, for you works the same way? Did you hear what he said? No, sorry, I do not speak his language. You do not know the language of the seagulls? Impossible! Then, he basically said ...

It has a new girlfriend and a two year old who loves Francesca. Bravo, so you do you: when you realize that something is infinite, and better than ... And better than I am Shut up and mind my own business. Exact. - Sorry. - Yup. You too, despite the age difference, you seem very af fi atati. If you consider that fi no to a week ago I did not even know existed ... Come? However all my favorite characters are orphans. Oliver 'ﬁivist, Tom Sawyer, Dorothy That of the "Wizard of Oz"? Yes, then also Here, Dewey and Louie, all the Disney characters. Antoine Doinel. Even if a mother really have it, he is like an orphan. In fact they send him to boarding school. - Who is Antoine Doinel? - As someone who has? And a character in various fi lm a French director named Truffaut. Wait, why you still watch the fi lm? Why not you? No, I mean, I watched them as a child, Now I only watch the series, I am much better. Have you ever made a midnight swim? - No. - Me neither, you wanna do it? The fact is that I have the costume, you know, do not have it. - You have the pants, right? AI dark enough. - You say? Yes, I'm going to ask my mother and your brother.

A structure very serious, very organized, Ela undoubtedly best for everyone. For John, definitely not. A child who lost his parents in need of a family. Yes, but we're not a family. - He knows the college? Have you spoken? - Not yet. You know what? I do not have the courage. - Hey, so what? What did they say? - They said no. Maybe we should not ask him? No, in fact, it was better. In addition to being the first to speak of sky brightness, Moebius also studies the various cases of rainbow depending on the diameter of the raindrops. Raindrops They are elongated, not of spherical shape. - You did not have to leave? - I convinced Mom to postpone. How can I make you understand? For example... On a glass, or even a tear running down a face we will notice that the direction of elongation Ela same fall. The same is not true pearl raindrops. Those will lengthen in the direction perpendicular to gravity. E... We also know that two people nearby, also very close together, shoulder to shoulder, They will never see the same rainbow. This escape any kind of rule of classification, in my humble opinion, It is the unique and haunting beauty rainbow. It appears suddenly, a bit 'as a person that at a certain point, unexpectedly, He broke into your life and nothing is as it was. Then, for Viganella is 460.1 kilometers.

You're happier when there is someone you like. - We've been looking for. - I was watching this sign. Do you feel like if we go to see what's there? All right. - How beautiful! - Superb. - It's full of vintage gear. - It had to be a stable, I think. Who knows how long these things are here. Look at that tractor. - But what is that? - I think it's "Twentieth Century." I read on the plaque out there that have shot here. You wanted to have fun? Well, now she cries. The game is beautiful when short-lived. Leave her alone, it's been a while. We know that the bastards grow all bad. Bastardo? Who said you bastard? There are bastards in my house. Olmo and brother of your sons because his father is one of us. Bastardo. Dalcò Olmo. Try to be more clever. Olmo. - Now that you're great ... - And you still dirty shit! Come forward. Remember this, you will learn to read and write, but always keeps Dalcò Olmo, son of villagers. A starved. You're going to be a soldier. You'll see the world. - You will also need to learn to obey. - And to fetch kick your ass! You shall take a wife and labor, to pull up your sons. You will learn to be patient. - But what will remain forever? - Dalcò Olmo. Dalcò Olmo, villager. Here she is. I like Olmo. You're stupid? What are you doing? How are you? Well, however, there is one thing. Thing? him that night on the beach I heard you. Stefano wants to put John in a boarding school and did not tell him. He'll tell you. I too am very sorry. But we can not judge, everyone has his Life. You still do not tell John, are things between them. You look bigger, you know? You're happy to be a bit 'with Daddy now? Yes, although these days I'm just fine. And nice, John, intelligent. Pure brave. You say how is facing everything? His parents, what has happened? Yes, but now I said it for something else. Thing? He gave me a kiss. Do you understand, John ?! # A birretta ... # - What do I do? - I do not know, there's too much stuff. - Well, you choose. - You know I can not. - It 'count, take what comes. - Come on. Here, I choose, I go. So let's talk about important things. - How's Francesca? - And you with Simona? So what does Simona now? We're talking about you. Are you talking about me. Mamma mia, John, relax a moment. For once listen to me, I have to make an important speech. Then, there are two types of men. If you belong to the first category, that is, you are a fi c in the classical sense, do not need to do anything, it's all easy. Women fall at your feet. But it's too easy, there is no fun, we do not like. If you belong to the second category, that is, six in a co fi more alternative way, like us, so to speak, you have to work harder. The stun you, you gotta be hypnotized, but above all you have to make people laugh. - Yes, but what for? - But how! To achieve the main goal, to get to the number one goal, that kiss! So I know that I belong to the first category. What do you mean? In the sense that I've already kissed. "Mortacci"! # There are night # # Too many uncomfortable things to say # # # To find peace # There are silences disarming # # In which we hide # # To afraid to catch his fi ed # # And to say I love you # # Look at us, we delude ourselves to be free # # Whirling between alcohol # # # To escape the wounds # To disinfect the bruises # # Consuming loneliness # # But we are just useless # So tell me # # # Tell me of your worries # # Only two can shake # And I notice # # holding you # What we are fragile in love # We mechanisms illogical # # # But sometimes just a word # Just one word. She's gorgeous. - Thank you. - Looks like you. - I can? - Sure. - So, do you understand this? - Yup. If I think that I first kiss was at 19 years old! - So soon? - What are you doing, sfotti? - And she was drunk. - And what do you know? - Intuition women. - Sure. What's up? Do you like something to drink together? I'm falling asleep, then later, the bar will be closed. For that matter, I do open in five minutes. Four. Three. It's open. "Ahò". The room I do not have it. To do what she wants she has an attic. Here are the keys, not his money I do not need. I open the door. Where is it? Here it is. You are welcome. - And why would that be? - How would that be? This is the bar. Here is the space outside for appetizers. This would be the bar? Let's say it's a multi-purpose room, here. Yes, but not the images you use. See the women, sometimes? They always think wrong. What then it would be rather well, for me its a huge fine. But according to me also for you would be a huge asset. Just do not yet you are aware. And then maybe, if you give me a kiss, I turn into a prince, what do you know? Madonna, how beautiful you are. Ta-da! Mamma mia, felt, wait a second here, dear. - I go to the bathroom a moment, I go back suffered. - Ok. Mamma mia, are in the fi nal of the Champions! But? Tico Tico # tic # # Tico tico tac ... # Va beh. "Ahò". Holy shit! Not tonight, tonight, no! Absorb, absorbed, he absorbed. Filthy slut. Arrival. But for fuck's sake! # Tico tico tic tac tico tico # Tico Tico Tico Tico # tico ... # Thou hast also stripped. Mamma Mia. Here I am.

It was wonderful. What? As "it was great"? We have not done anything yet. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding? No, you're not kidding. So I kill me though, so no. And worst of the fi nal with Liverpool, is not done. That looks nice. - You're going to see? - Mom, can we go to? - Yes, hurry. - Let's suffered. Wow! Wow! Yes, hello. John, I do not take it anymore, I have to tell you something. It's a bad thing? - I'm sorry about last night. - Me too. - But I instill it was better that way? - Just as well no, come on, not for me. I gave the foreman the wall all night. Sorry. There's this guy in Paris waiting for me. I'll understand if you can be a true story. - No, I think not. - But what do you know, I'm sorry? - Then why not? - I know, you see. And then I think he's gay. And a very kind he chatted in Paris, "très talk." You are an idiot, but risks to fail me. If you knew you. I hope you've changed your mind. We can have the heart to dump him in an institution. It is not a decision I can make alone. Should I confront my wife. - There you were separated? - Yes but... - But you tell a lot of crap. - Yeah. Here the boys. So, we are ready, we want to go? You're a liar and a coward, I with you not going anywhere. - What you say, what happens? - But stop fi Ngere! Do not fool me, I'm Dalcò Olmo and you are the bastard. Reply. Yes, Luciana, ready? No, we're going to Paris. In Paris, you. The first installment does not pay anyone because Giovanni in college do not go there. No, I just do not want to conceal carry. Rather. I am ashamed for having told all those lies. Do not deceive children. It will not be hurting him that we will return to love, right? I do not care about the money, Luciana. I'm an idiot? No. I would be an idiot if I let him escape me now. These days I understand that John is not only my brother, it is something more. You know who he is? He is Dalcò Olmo. I know you do not know who it is, leave it alone. It is not anyone's fault, but that's how things should go. Ciao. Ready Set Go! forks! You will understand that ... Boh. Quiet, it does not last long, a summer storm. The lords have decided? Per me a croque monsieur, per favore. Finally. Thanks to her, you also learned how to decide. "In my opinion anch" però "three".
