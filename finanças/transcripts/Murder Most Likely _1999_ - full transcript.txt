[dramatic music] KELLY: Undercover is a knack. Some guys have it. Some guys don't. I have it. Welcome to the drug squad, gentlemen, the Royal Canadian Mounted for real. The job you are training to do is dangerous, unorthodox, and controversial. You will be away from your families and loved ones for extended periods of time. It will cost you friends. And what do you get in exchange for all this hard and lonely work? $1 a day. Kelly's got it. Has anyone not got the idea here yet? No rules. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR: We only chose 16 men for that program, and Patrick Kelly was the best. What makes a Pat Kelly-- the ability to play a part convincingly, the right combination of courage, ability, charisma? He came alive when he started working the streets. You sweating, Pat? I don't sweat. Yeah, you ought to. He's meeting her in the lobby. Bad idea, stupid. It's her idea. She's the dealer. It's a good idea. No, you never let the target control the meeting. You don't have to be good to figure that out, just smart. You're a long way from Owen Sound, Patty boy. This is the big time, and it's your ass in there. You're right. It is my ass. And I am taking it out on tour. Hey, Frankie. How you doing? You look-- what? What? Did you lose a dog or something? Look. I'm all alone, sweetheart, all right? I'm all-- - Don't call me sweetheart. I really hate that. OK, you're right. That's not very, uh-- how about cream pie? Can I call you that? Can I call you honey cakes? Shut up. You're really beautiful. You know that? You are. - Shut up. - You are. You're beautiful. God, ow. - Stop that. My boyfriend's in there. Oh, well, that's good, 'cause I'm kind of right where I want to be, just looking at you. [music playing] [SINGING] Wild eyes, I can't look away from your wild eyes. Are you actually looking for something? Or do you just like me? Funny guy. $700. I can count. You can count. That's great. You look smarter in here when you count it in front of me, really. Come on. It's two bundles. $700 gets me two. Just get them out. Get out of here, hmm? We don't keep it here. Well, then I keep my money in my hand, in my hand. What is this, a supermarket? They're just buying a little, too. Hey. Uh, oh, he's a cop. He busted me on Isabella last week. Hey, hey, man. Who's the bitch, huh? She with you? She with you? He's not a cop. I know this guy. He's not a cop. You think I'm a cop, huh? You think I'm a cop? Hey, hey, hey, what are you talking about? Are you gonna shoot me? No, wait, Tom. KELLY: What are you gonna do, huh? Look. I-- I must have-- I thought-- I thought he was somebody else, all right? What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be? OK. Beautiful, two weeks ago, he's got her in cuffs. Tonight, he makes a buy op, and she doesn't even remember. Dumb luck. What luck? He talked her out of it. He was so scared, he had to buy new underwear. Hey, Larry, Larry, I still made the buy. Small time, it was a couple of bundles, nothing. Not like last week, when Art and I busted Harry. Did I tell you about that? No. Oh, yeah, Harry and his old lady. So did you really hit that woman? - No. - No? No. Oh, they-- they said that you did. Well, I did. You did? Well, it wasn't me. I mean, it wasn't me, you know? It's kind of like a character, sort of like an actor. Me, I'd never hit a woman, unless she asked me to. You lie for a living. [laughter] So Harry's old lady pops the trunk. There's 10 kilos of coke 3 feet away. But Harry's got us figured for cops, right? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. So naturally-- So it's the old lady's car, right? Yeah, so he just starts walking away, like he's never seen this stuff before in his life, right? Trying to stay clean. So we pat him down. And goddamn it if Harry doesn't have a kilo right in his pocket. We just threw it right in the seat. That's where I patted him down, right? Right in front of him, stupid Harry. Wait a minute, whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys, you dropped it on him? Hey, somebody had to. Fair is fair. We worked hard on this guy. I mean, we're not going to let him walk. He was up to his ass in coke. Yeah, but what happens when you go to court? You've got to testify under oath. Yeah, and I tell it like I told it to you, only I tell it better. Do you think Harry is going to tell the truth on the stand? I don't think so. Yeah, I did it. I did it. Lock me away, please. That'll be the day. It's like I said, fair is fair. You'll figure it out. It works out all right in the end. He was perfect undercover material. He had no family in Toronto, no wife, no particular girlfriend, at least not until he made that trip to Mexico. Hey, you're supposed to want to get caught. MARIE: Am I? Look, I'm a cop. Stop, or I'll shoot you. Promise? You don't seem to understand your situation here. I'm a dangerous man. And you've ruined my dress. Yeah. What are you going to do about that? I thought I'd kiss you. OK. OK. OK. [romantic music] What's your perfume? I don't wear perfume. Oh, my God, I'm in big trouble. Yes, you are. So why don't you shut up? Are you rich? I could be. Are you? I should be. I'm sort of too rich. That's not an answer. That's not a-- what? What kind of answer is that? That's not-- Wait your turn. All right. How big are your feet? Um, they're big enough to stand on. How many men have you had? Oh, good question, um, 453. Wow. And you? I don't do men. No, is that why you grind your teeth when you sleep? How do you know I grind my teeth? How do you think I'd know that? I was grinding them on the beach? Yes. [guitar playing] What are you doing? Seeing what you look like dead, my dangerous man. Don't leave tomorrow. You know, you-- you could visit me in Toronto. It's a long way from France to Toronto. What if I said I was in love with you? It would still be a long way from France to Toronto. You haven't said that. I'm in big trouble. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: And I was, and I wasn't. She was gorgeous. She was alive. It was right. It was absolutely right. She was smart. She was fun. She was brave. She had high hopes and great expectations, and so did I. Who else could there be? She was the woman I loved. [music playing] My poor, little girl, I asked her, what do you know about him? What do you know about this Kelly? I told her, it doesn't seem quite right to me. There's something false in him. There's a lie in him, my poor baby. [music playing] Mrs. Kelly? Jesus Christ. Do something. Give her mouth to mouth. Maybe you should cover up, Mr. Kelly. Cover up, Mr. Kelly. Yeah, yeah. I had-- I had her. I just-- I just couldn't, um-- I couldn't hold. I couldn't hold. [woman shouting] [dramatic music] I could see her. She wasn't, uh, she went way over the side. And I just could-- I couldn't, uh-- what? - You're bleeding. I think I'm gonna puke. When did I first start to have doubts about Kelly? Right from the start-- yeah, you could maybe think it was because he's a cop. I'm a cop. He's living in a fancy apartment and driving a fancy car. Sure, that's a little hard to take. And you wonder how he's doing it. Well, the truth is there were things that just didn't fit in. Your wife was going to Italy? Yes, sir. She had less than an hour to get to the airport when she fell? That's right. I can't stand that. KELLY: Stand what? [clanging] Did you hear that? KELLY: Hear what? The noise. Oh, yeah. Nobody fixes anything in this place. I'm sorry. I'm just not a very handy guy. I don't mean you. You'll go nuts alone here with that rattle. Who says I'll be alone? Ha ha ha, just kidding. EXLEY: She heard a rattle? KELLY: Yeah. EXLEY: Did you? KELLY: Yeah, of course, I heard it. It had been driving us both crazy. MARIE: Patrick. You made it from the kitchen to the balcony in the time it took your wife to go over the edge? How long would that take, do you think? Whatever it took, I don't know. Two seconds maybe, I don't know. Two seconds, you think? Well, how-- how would I know that exactly? EXLEY: Got a lot of people to try it. Got runners to try it. Best anyone could ever do was 3.8 seconds. How long? EXLEY: She'd have been on the ground-- by then. Other things, too, didn't add up. You know, sometimes they're like that, cases. There's just a bunch of little things that don't quite ring true. Oh, and don't forget, Patrick Kelly was an undercover cop, a trained liar. Yeah, Patrick Kelly never did ring true. What do you think that's all about? We found a 17-page letter detailing your assets. It's very neat. It looked like a separation agreement to us. It wasn't. Mr. Kelly, were you and your wife having marital difficulties, plainly put? She had been depressed. Lately, she was happy. All right, why don't you go home and get some rest? Uh, you understand why I have to ask you these questions, Mr. Kelly. You were a police officer, so you understand. No hard feelings? Oh, uh, last thing, last thing-- your wife was insured against accidental death? Mm-hmm, yeah, um, our policy was $190,000 for both of us. She left to me. I left to her. And, uh, she had another policy with Canadian Airlines, where she worked. Was your wife afraid of heights, Mr. Kelly? No, she was not afraid of heights. I am, all right? Why was your wife not wearing any underwear? What is this, hmm? Is this, like, a technique? This is like "Columbo?" Just a question, Mr. Kelly. When she went out to check a rattle one hour before she had a flight to Italy, why was she not wearing any underwear? She never wore underwear. That's why I married her. Subcutaneous bleeding here, discoloration of the face, there's a small cut on the inside of the upper lip. All of this is inconsistent with a fall. There's no way that the top of her head could have hit the concrete. Maybe it snapped back when she hit. Well, it couldn't have, not that far. The back of her head hit the concrete, though, but there's no swelling or bleeding back there, probably because her heart stopped beating at the instant of impact. Then what did it? A blunt blow before the fall. A fist? Possibly. [organ music] [sobbing] It's OK. Hi. Tom. Thanks for coming. It's too bad about the weather. It really should rain at funerals, shouldn't it? [laughter] EXLEY: So many little things didn't add up. And then there was April Trent. She called us. Have a seat, Ms. Trent. No. Is something troubling you? Yeah, oh, yeah, there's a lot troubling me, a lot. There's a thing that's going to have to be said. I-- I feel that it should be said. Pat's an actor. You have to understand that. Well, I think we do. It was probably the thing that kept him happiest when he was working undercover, was the acting. So when he met someone, there was a purpose in that relationship. And no matter how strong he was with that person during that relationship, it would always end at a certain time. Are you saying you had a relationship with him? Were you lovers? No, that-- that's not the kind of relationship we had, not like some mad love thing. I understood him. And I-- I wanted to help him. That's all. Is that what you wanted to tell us? This is-- this is what bothers me. This is why I feel I have to say this. This is how everything started. What started? He told me several times that he wanted-- He wanted to kill his wife? --to leave the country. So where were we, huh-- jealousy, anger, triangle, love misunderstood? Did Kelly kill her? Of course, we knew from day one, locked. But what you gotta do when you want to prove something is prove it. [sighing] [dramatic music] [sobbing] KELLY: She was beautiful. I mean, she looked good, but I don't mean that. She had a glow. A glow came from her. Of course, you can. [spanish] [speaking spanish] [laughter] Look. I wouldn't even-- I would never say this, anyway. Why? Well, you don't. You [inaudible] You don't say, hey. I'm a policeman. Hands in the hair. I'm gonna shoot you if you don't kiss me. Be a good boy. Just try. All right. [speaking spanish] Very good, now-- All right. You take out your big gun. Uh-huh. And you look him in the eye. But I don't carry a gun. Why? - Hmm? - Why? Why? I just don't. You should, in case somebody is trying to shoot you. No, no. No, Marie, if the dealer found a gun on me, he would shoot me, bang. Things happen. Like what? Like what? Yeah. Like Jimmy. Jimmy, all right, what about Jimmy? Um, he's in the hospital. Yeah, he is. He is. But it's nothing. It's just normal, standard stuff. Any time an undercover officer gets into any-- into whatever, they take him. They, you know, check him out. But with Jimmy, there were these dealers who thought that he had stiffed them. They took him out. They talked to him. They slapped him around a little bit, just to scare him, but that's it. That's all. Yeah, but April said he almost died. April? What you-- you believe April? April's a-- April doesn't know anything. Jimmy made a mistake. I don't make mistakes. You know that. No, no, I don't know anything. I just hate your job. I hate thinking you might get hurt. God, what would I do? What would I do if you didn't come back? Well, I'll always come back. I'll always come back, always, always. You've got nothing to worry about. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: She had high hopes and a big smile. That was Marie. She always had a big smile. You know, she wanted the best she could get. If life's a pie, she'd say, I want a big piece of it. And why not? She deserved. We deserved it, all we could get, everything. Where are we? Home, come on. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: And, you know, the things I did for her, well, I did them for me, too. What do you think? We can't afford this. It's less than half of what we'd pay for a shoe box in the city. Still can't afford it. Listen. Just OK, close your eyes. Close them. OK, what do you hear? Do you hear any cars? Do you hear any sirens? Do you hear any screaming? Do you hear people running around? No, it's heaven. Well, it's Cookstown, anyway. I still won't cook on this, I feel like. I still won't care. You-- you'll quit the drug squad? For you, I would quit anything. I will. I'll get reassigned to the buried attachment and do really boring cop work. I'll hand out parking tickets. - You won't like it. - I will. I-- look. It's just-- the drug squad is just a job. I'm not stuck. Come on. Trust me. I'll get reassigned. No more drug squad, and you'll have no more sleepless nights, OK? You will? Yeah. And, of course, they never really let me out of the drug squad. [rock music] I was supposed to break clean, but that never happens. And maybe I didn't want it to. Was I really going to write parking tickets? And, you know, when it comes right down to it, big town, small town, it makes no difference. A guy with a gun is still a guy with a gun. [rapid breathing] My God, are you OK? Broke it. Tell your dentist. You will need a better guard if you are going to be fighting the bad guys six or eight hours every night. You know, I'd probably sleep a whole lot better if I just had you in my mouth. Maybe what we need is a baby. A baby? Yeah. Yeah, babies are nice. But I think what we need is a Porsche. A Porsche? A baby? Yeah, you know, families are supposed to have kids to-- to ride in their cars and play in their yards. Right. OK, well, let's get to work. Oh, boy or girl? Hmm, Jorga or Gabrielle? How about we have one of each? How are you gonna pay for it? Mm, money, money is easy. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: Well, actually, money is not really all that easy. I was risking my life for $21,000 a year, trying to bust dealers who were making that much in an hour. It's frustrating. So, you know, you take a little here. You take a little there. And suddenly your realize you've picked up a whole lot of skills on the job, things you can sell anywhere, on any side of the law. Are you still working with Nicky Carson, a paid informant? I know your file. You must have friends. I've got good connections, Christians in action. CIA? Want an onion ring? No, thanks. I don't know your name. Sammy. Sammy what? X, Y, Z, does it matter? I need a variety of items moved from a variety of locations to a variety of other locations. KELLY: Moving things? Well, that's a snap. The only trick is not getting caught. But then I had RCMPIB, and that'll take you almost anywhere, across any border, into almost any room. Yeah, from time to time, they make stupid jokes. But they never go through your bags. And as far as taking off someplace for a week or two, what would the force know? I went a lot of places, all over the world. And why would anyone ask any questions? I was undercover. If they saw me around too much, it probably meant I wasn't doing my job. So I was a busy Mountie. While I'm down here, gentlemen, if you don't mind, I think I'm going to-- You just stay put there, son. I paid a lot of money for this. Well, that may be, but I'm just a delivery boy. Well, delivery boy, this isn't exactly what I wanted. I might just have to hang onto you. [gunfire] I need something else moved. This time, I had to get two 4-foot, square palettes loaded with 18-inch, square, plastic packages to Nicosia, Cyprus. Well, OK, package them as blood products. Put them in a refrigerated unit with some other medical stuff, and put them on a boat disguised as a hospital ship. That took a little while to organize, which was a good thing, because I had a side line going with this priest in Colombia. He was connected to some rich Colombians who wanted to move money out of the country and into US banks, unfortunately, not legal, but also not a problem. Now the priest moved the money to Mexico. I picked it up in Acapulco, drove it to Hermosillo on the Arizona border. I hired some Mexican farmers to hide the money in vegetable trucks and drive it across the border to Nogales, in Arizona. Then I picked it up, and I flew it to New York. [horns honking] Forgive me, Father. I have made some terrible mistakes. Nothing a little penance won't cure. You first. Under the seat. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: Piece of cake, $20,000 a drop, it's amazing how easy it can be to make money if you keep moving. It took me a month to get the deal done, but it went off without a hitch. The blood products got delivered. I made $50,000, and everybody went home happy. Where did we get this cow? Hardy's Store. It's tough. It's the best there is in this town. [barking] That's all we have to eat. We'll go out. Where? The Palace Pier is a very exclusive location. Come on in. [music playing] [emergency sirens] [startled gasp] Shh, it's all right. I've got you. I'll hold you. Look at that view. It's beautiful. It's what you deserve. You know it's perfect. It is perfect. The city again, a life again. Yeah, we can fill it with antiques. We'll get a couple of chairs, big ones, put them right there. And then we can watch the sunset. Hmm, but not-- not without selling the house. Oh, we'll be fine. We'll be fine. I think that house will go pretty quick. So you were in Algonquin Park the night of the fire? Yeah, at a friend's place, selling antiques. And your wife was in, uh, France? That's right, visiting relatives. We found this in the living room of your house. Mm-hmm. Wondered if it might be yours. Well, how the hell should I know? They all look the same. Did you happen to look in the garden shed? Yeah. And did you find a can in the garden shed? Well, Then this probably belongs to the guy that torched my house. Thought you might have more than one. You call this police work, hmm? Why are you talking to me about gas cans? Why are you talking to me at all? I'm an undercover cop. I've busted maybe 600 guys. Half of them hate my guts. Why don't you go talk to them? I like to start with the physical evidence. Physical evidence, listen. I'll give you some physical evidence. Alan Weston has been talking all over town about how he's going to blow my head off. Kenny Rochan has been bragging he's got a contract out on me. Pick up the can, and go and show it to them. I'm just trying to do my job, sir. Do it better! Sir, thank you. Thank you. Marie, come on. They're not bellhops. They're cops. They've got to have both hands free so they can, you know, shoot straight. Oh, not funny. Come on. Someone tried to kill you. They didn't do a very good job, did they? What if they come after us? What if they find us here? Don't worry, all right? Please, these guys will take care of us. They'll shoot them. Bang, dead, come on. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR: Kelly was a good undercover officer, and he did have 400 drug buys to his credit. Naturally, he had enemies. Could one of them have come after him? It's possible. Still, the OPP investigation raised a lot of interesting questions. He couldn't sell his house, and he'd signed for a condominium he couldn't pay for. People do burn houses for money. And there seemed to be a lot of it in his life, money, more than we were paying. Yeah, Arbuckle. Hey, Arbuckle, how you doing? Listen. Oh, I'm fine. You know, I mean, as fine as you can be living in a motel, waiting on insurance money. L Listen. I'm calling because I wanted to talk to you about that gas can. You're telling me that you-- KELLY: Yeah, yeah, I am. And I-- I know it all sounds kind of stupid. I-- I had to- it must have just been the excitement and whatnot. And I-- I don't know. I guess I just forgot. Anyway, I kind of remembered this morning, so I thought I'd call. The thing is, you see, I had, in fact, borrowed a friend's lawn mower. And his used straight gas. Mine used an oil-gas mixture. And so I needed gasoline, so I got a gas can. And, uh, I got it at the hardware at Seventh and Woodbine. Come on, Arbucky. You know, you-- you forget these little things, given circumstances like that. Did you know that we were about to test that can for prints? - No. No, I mean, I didn't know you were, but I imagined you were going to. So, uh, I guess I saved you the trouble. Yeah, I guess you have. KELLY: I hated that those bastards thought I'd burned down my own house, hated it. So I took a polygraph. I volunteered, and I passed it. But that didn't matter to them, no, not to them. You see, they were out to get me. It was the new game, get Kelly. And, all right, maybe I didn't love my house, but I loved my furniture. I-- I loved what Marie had collected. It was us. It was the history of us. For a bit of cash, I would be so stupid? I could always get cash. Here. Come on. Hurry it up. Look. The thing is that I didn't see this happen. What do you mean? You just saw it. I gave the snitch $2 grand. You were right there. Uh, you were sitting in the car. You could have given him $20 for all I know. How long have you had this sugarcane up your ass? Patrick, I'm supposed to see it, I mean, clearly see it. It's regulations. Bullshit regulations, you sit on my lap, you scare the snitch off. Come on. Nobody follows the goddamn regulations, anyway. We'd never make a case. We are on the same side, right? Forget it. Look, all right, fine. But don't do this again. No. Never again. No. You really got to lighten up, pal. Well, he told me that I should never buy anything but roses. Anything else, he said, would wilt next to me. And then he just walked away, just like that. He knew exactly how to win me. He-- he found me the next day at the library where I worked. And, uh, we talked some more, but not until he'd given me that whole night to remember him and think about him. He didn't push. I saw him on and off for months after that. We'd talk for hours, just talk. He gave me all the time I needed. Hey. Is-- is a woman living here? Mm-hmm. - Who? - Who's the woman? Yes. She's my wife. OK. [laughter] I knew you'd ask that. Look, I told you I was undercover, right? Well, they give you a whole life. You get a birth certificate, passport, ID, credit cards. And on a couple of cases I was working on, I had to have a wife. So that was Marie. I mean, technically, she's my wife, yeah. But she's not really my wife. It's just part of the cover. Is she ever here? No, hardly, and when she is, she sleeps on the couch. MISTRESS: Did I believe him? I wanted to. He was very, very convincing. And he knew exactly how to win me. I've been told that he was very, very good at that, winning people, well, maybe not all of them. In the past 18 months, on credit cards that we know about, you've spent $42,000 more than you've earned. Where did that money come from? Antiques, sir. And in the past year, you've bought a second apartment in the Palace Pier. Where did that money come from? And also in the past year, you bought a condo in Molokai, Hawaii. Where did that money come from? More antiques, sir. Such as the antiques that were destroyed in your house fire? The insurance claim for which remains unpaid because of the OPP investigation, or because of you. Why would the Royal Canadian Mounted Police want a public insurance company or the OPP or anybody else to know what it is that we're concerned about? How would that serve any purpose of ours? Constable, you pay income tax on a salary of $21,000 a year, yet your earnings are evidently much more than that, all of them undeclared, like the, um, $2,000 paid to an informant that was never paid. No, no, no, listen. Here, I signed this receipt, and it's countersigned by another officer. Who didn't see the exchange, who admits he didn't see the exchange. Are you accusing me of-- Yes, the informant tells us you paid him $500. Well, he's lying. He's setting me up. I see. All this is a lot more difficult to deal with than, uh, fingerprints on a gas can, Constable. KELLY [VOICEOVER]: I could see where this was heading, but I didn't give them the satisfaction. I quit the force. They didn't even bother to finish the investigation. I got a superannuation and a certificate of service, free and clear. I got the insurance money on the house, every penny of it. It took the OPP two and a half years to put their case together, and it only took an hour for the judge to throw it out. Now does that sound like they had a case, any kind of case at all? But by then, the damage was done. It's tough being a suspect. It put a lot of strain on Marie and me, a lot of strain on our marriage. Oh, hi. Good day? Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ, Marie. What are they looking for? How the hell should I know? That's great. You're one of them. No, I'm not. They're provincial. I'm federal. Now how many were there? - Two. - Suits or-- - I answered the door. They both-- Shush, in suits or in uniforms? Suits. All right, what did they look at? - They-- - Yeah? The furniture. - What else? - Nothing else. Then that's what they were looking at, furniture. So why-- why-- why don't they leave you alone? I don't know. How the hell should I know? Why don't you tell me the truth? The truth? Yeah. About what? About-- Hmm, about what, Marie? About anything. About what, Marie? Exactly, hmm? About money. About money, go. American Express, why are they always calling about the car? Because you spend too much. And I paid that bill this morning. They called. I went in, and I paid it, all right? From what account? From cash. From what cash? God I don't understand what we have. I don't understand where it comes from. What possible difference could it make where it comes from? I get it. You spend it. Now shut up! I can't stand it. I can't take any
