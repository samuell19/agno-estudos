HALFWAY Stop embarrassing yourself. Oh no, no. I might faint. Is it... anemia? Yeah... Ah, the room's spinning. Is your head spinning? Are you OK? I'm not OK. This will cool you down. OK.

Hmm? About what? Shinozaki. Hmm. You know... Whenever he's close I just feel woo... It's as if... he gets within 25m of me, I just feel woo. I'm going to fall apart at this rate. Just wear a sign. Huh? How exactly... How? What if I get rejected? Then you get rejected. There's lots of guys just like Shinozaki. No there's not. It has to be Shinozaki. OK then. Practice! Right now. Practice what? The confession. - Confession? - Yes! 'Here' is at the river bank on the way home. Hey... What is it? Your shoe laces are undone... bye. And... hey! I can't look him in the eyes. Hey! - Hey... - What is it? The social window is... open. Just don't look in his eyes. No, like I gradually look up to him. Your tie is bent. I can slowly look up. - Slowly look up to him? - Yeah, I'll try. Um. The sky is beautiful, no? Hey! Sorry, you alright? Teacher! Shinozaki got hurt. - How? - In the game. Hurry. This way. What time is it? Are you OK Hiro? Oh, how's the game going? Might have a nap in the infirmary. Shinozaki...? - Yo. - Yo. Just have a nosebleed. Ah-huh. Is the nurse here? I just had a dream about Shinozaki. I confessed to him, I said "I like you." And he said, "I've liked you too for a while now." Oh no! I can't believe it. Who would believe it. Isn't it funny? I'm so amazing... That dream was a bit too much. But it's just a dream, huh. Could this dream come true? A foretelling dream. Meme. Today I'm going to confess to him. Huh? As if I could do that, too embarrassing. - Good morning. - Good morning. I couldn't do something so embarrassing, huh? Very embarrassing... You should probably get some rest. - I'll get you a new one. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. - I'm too excited to sleep. - Really? Can't take it. Dizzy... Um, you know... Would you... go out with me? Huh? That... being asked that all of a sudden. I need some time. Huh!? Ow. You OK? - Ah, yes. - Yes? - Can you go on? - Yeah. - You OK? - Huh?

I'm Tasuku Mori. Ah, Takusan... "Tasuku." Tasuku. Some more, Yakisoba. Sin is the S. Like this. Then you add both this one part of y=3x and y=x. This part of x becomes sin. I'll get you something. - I'll get you something. - What's this surprise? - I'll get you some juice. - Thank you. Shu, where are you going to University? Hmm. You? I'm going to Sapparo College of Welfare. Huh... I see. Yep. So you're going there. So, where are you going? I haven't decided..yet. Have to decide soon. It'll be bad if you don't decide soon, huh? Yeah... - Will it be OK? - It'll be fine. - What will you do? - What should I do... Oh, a slide. - I lied. - I see an overpass. - I know. - I'm too fast. What should we sing? I'm sorry! Hiro? Oh. Tasu... Taku... Taku? Takkusa! - It's Tasuku. - Ah, Tasuku. Sorry. You're not with Shu today? Probably not today. Tasuku. - What? - Over here... just come here. What? Can I ask you... Do you know where Shu is going to? University? Waseda. - Huh? - Waseda. Waseda? Waseda in Tokyo? Yeah. Waseda in Tokyo!? You didn't know? Waseda in Tokyo...? Well I'll be going to Hokkaido University. Best to stick to your roots. Should be an easy commute. What about you, Hiro? Waseda... Tokyo...? Waseda... Tokyo... What's with Tokyo!? I don't have anything. Yes you do. So, you're not going to say it? Say what? That's why... What? Don't you have something you have to tell me? Huh? Not "huh." If you've got something, just out with it. I've said I don't. Your face says you do. - It does not. - It does. No, it doesn't. Because I already know what it is. What's that? What do you know? Wonder what would happen if I jumped in and started swimming. - Huh? - What do you think? What do you think would happen? It looks cold... It would probably be very cold. Hmm. Maybe I'll jump in. Can you please stop that? - Wonder if it's cold. - It's dangerous, stop it! What University have you chosen? Huh? - Aaah! - Oh! Wase... Hmm? "Wase"? Da, probably. Hey, hey, where's this Waseda? Huh? Is this "Waseda" close by? Is it around here? Yeah... - Why didn't you say anything!? - That hurts. Huh? How could you? How can you? What? When were you going to tell me you were going off to Tokyo? What are you feeling? How did you feel about telling me? Just what am I going to do!? Huh? - I do... - How do you feel about me right now? - I don't know. - What are you thinking? I honestly don't know. I'm asking you seriously? What will happen to us? Screw you. I'm serious about this. Over here, Hiro. A sneak attack... Give me a break... for today. Could you be serious for a second. OK. I'm really trying to talk here. Yes. Calm down Hiro. Hiro, calm down. Shinozaki! - Woo woo. - You're really serious over there! Shinozaki! - What's up? - Get it together. You're so serious over there. It's not like that. What's up? Don't follow me. - Huh? - Don't follow me. - I can't hear a word. - Don't follow me! - What should... - Huh? What should I believe in? You should believe in me. Have you got a moment? - Huh? - Is now OK? Yeah, what's wrong? I need some advice. Some application advice. I want your advice. Yep. So? I was... wondering if I should give up on Waseda? Uh-uh. Why? I'm too attached to this place. I'm also... dating someone. I probably won't get to see her if I go to Tokyo. Hmm. Well that's understandable. Mr. Shinozaki? Yes, teacher? Don't you think you are narrowing your options for the future? - Teacher? - Yes, go ahead. I don't really understand. Well... Yes? Your future... From what you have told me now. - Yes? - Don't you think... You are limiting your options? - Maybe... - I think so. It may be... that if you get used to somewhere, and then face moving to an entirely new place, having to start over from scratch. This is no easy feat. This kind of starting over requires some courage. But I think it's necessary. I agree. But... You know, life is longer than you think. But. Now is also important. Well it is your life. Yeah. Your first big decision. You probably won't take my advice. Maybe. But I do want you to think it through some more. Time is running out though. That hurts. Give it some thought. I will. Mr. Indecisive. Catch ya' later. Hey! Stop running! Wait! Hey! Hiro! - Open the door! - Why do you have to follow me!? No! If you come in you are a stalker! Don't come here. Stop walking! Just standing. Any closer and you're a stalker. - Stop it! - I'm your stalker! No sitting. Ah! Why do you run from me? Lately, you won't answer the phone or message me back. Well we're braking up and all. What? Haven't we broken up? Can you please explain when we broke up exactly? Just before. That was our brake-up? That was it for us. We're not broken-up. You completely left me out of the loop. It wasn't like that at all. It was, you put me aside. Come on... I already had plans to go, before we started dating. Then why did you ask me out? I really like you. Then why did you ask me out if you were leaving? I said that's because I like you You haven't thought this through at all. Why can't you get it? Then... I wonder if you could quit Waseda? Stop this Waseda thing. So I've decided to go to University. - Really? - Yep. You're going to Uni? Now is the time. You told me it didn't look like you were going to go. I did say that but... I thought there was no way. - You know... - What? - This will be a big surprise. - Yeah? My parents are getting married. Hmm? My parents are getting married now. It means I'm free now. All of a sudden I made up my mind. - For what? - To get married. What's with that!? Ow! It's so stupid. You should go to University. They said it so insignificantly. So now I have to think. - They told you that now? - Yeah, they told me now. So what will you do? I wanted to go to University. So I guess I'm happy. - Deciding that now...? - Deciding it now is... - Probably not easy. - Yeah. That's why... But I'm happy for you. - Hmm? - Today. Today? Well... How is Shinozaki lately? Tokyo huh. Look! Wow! - It was so round. - It was so not round. Oh, Shinozaki. You've got something to tell me today? Yeah. I've... quit Waseda. I decided to quit. - Is that so. - Yep. Then, your new choice? "Choice"? For your University. Um. 1..2.. - How is it? - Nostalgic. Very nostalgic. OK cheese. Do a strange face. OK cheese. Awesome! What's this!? OK cheese. Stand there. Yes ma'am. - Photo? - I'll take your photo. Do a pose. Pose? - Huh? Like what? - A funny one. - Start looking around? - Yeah, looking back version. The looking back version is better. - How is this reflecting memories... - No, looking back is better. - What the... - I'm taking it. Shu's been strange lately. Yeah. Did he say something about me? No, not really. Where's your umbrella? - Forgot it? - Yeah. - Here. - No, it's OK. - It's fine. - I'm waiting for friends. - Really? - Yeah. - Ah, your girlfriend? - No. - It's your girlfriend! - No, no. - It's got to be a girlfriend. - No it isn't. Sorry being a nuisance. Bye-bye. - Hey. - Hmm? Have you made up with Shun? Not yet. I wonder why he decided to quit Waseda. Huh? You didn't know? He's probably just stalling. Yeah. Thank you. No problem. Bye-bye. - Have fun with the girlfriend. - I said it's not like that. Hiro! Come here... a sec. Here. Talk a bit to my girlfriend. No way. - Why? - Just... please. - Why all of a sudden? - She's really nice. But why do I have to talk to her? It will help. Introduce yourself. - What... - It's fine. - But why? - It's fine. - No. - She's nice. - But... - It will help. What. Hello? Who's... Did you decide to quit Waseda? Huh? Why? Why did you quit?

That hurts. - I don't want to. - Too bad. It's not too bad. You should've said so from the beginning. If I said that from the beginning you wouldn't have let me. OK. Then, then, then... OK, we can use our mobiles. We can meet too. Would you have agreed? We can't meet. - See? - Not "See?" Don't laugh. A face. Face. It's a sad face. Look at it. It's my face right now. Here.

I said I am not mad. - Your face says you're mad. - I'm not mad. Even when you laugh you look mad. - Oh. - Oh? What happened? Hmm? Oh, I have a flat tire. A flat? - What to do. - Ah, it's really flat. Was it a nail? Nail? Do you have any tools? Tools? I have a spare here. - Tire? - Ah this. This to lift it up. - Do you know how? - Of course. I still have no idea about these things. There must be somewhere to put it. Here. If I put this on here... then... could you hold this? Which way... which way would it go? - Clock-wise. - Clock-wise? We'll try that. What effect will this have? So we can lift the car up. When it's lifted up we can change the tire. I can do it. Can you? Thanks... do you understand? Huh? What's with them. I want to see him. Hello? It's Hiro. What were you doing? Difficult study? Before I just did some really difficult math. Some math you taught me how to do. When x has no limit. Aren't I amazing? Yeah, amazingly amazing. Amazingly amazing? You well? Hmm. Are you really studying? Yeah, then I'll get back to it. Wait one minute. Wait wait wait. - It's Hiro. - I know, what is it now? What? "Now", am I that annoying? What are you doing? I was spacing. You should be studying. You're right. Because you're not so smart. So what is it? Hmm? Nothing really. OK then. It's nothing really. What are you doing? Looking at the sky. What's it like? Hmm? - It's really beautiful, no? - Really beautiful. It's pretty cool. Yeah. - Ah, a cow's flying. - Cow? Cow? Cow's can't fly... ah! - What? - A UFO. This is nice. Yeah, the wind. You know... What? - I was thinking... - About? Do I really like you? Sorry, bad reception, can't hear you. What did you say? What? What? What? With what? Excuse me. Teacher. He's sleeping. Teacher! Oh, you caught me. Where should I put this? Over there. What time is it? I'll help clean up. - It's fine, I've got work to do. - It's OK I can... These are the best ones. I see. Then I will get going. - Thanks. - It's OK. Want some tea? Some tea. Tea? - It's OK. - Come have some. I'll get some. - There's some ink here. - Ink? How are the entrance exams? They are so-so. What's so-so mean? - Huh? - It's fine. - Are you OK? - Yes. It must be hard. That study can be hard on you. That's true. Well I am a senior. You sound a little worried. Eh? I'm not worried. - You liar, I can tell from you face. - It's not a lie. It's written on your face. No it's not. I've known you since first year. I can tell something's bothering you. Nothing is. - Really? - Nothing, it's nothing. A friend of mine is worried. - A friend? - Yeah. What's wrong? They have a boyfriend. He wants to go to a University in Tokyo. - Your friend's boyfriend? - Yes. Then well, he was told not to go, to quit study in Tokyo... and he quit for me. Who's boyfriend? My... friend's boyfriend. - So her boyfriend... - Her boyfriend quit for her. Quit for her? That's, well, I asked him which do you like me or Tokyo? Me? - Your friend asked "me or Tokyo?" - Yes, my friend said... is it me or Tokyo? Well he quit Tokyo for her. Well, it's good he quit for her. It's like... once he quit, the feelings... changed to wanting him to go. But I don't want him to go. - Said your friend? - She said. He must really be liked... by your friend. So she wants him to be by his side. Yes. However, because she wants to be with him... she asks him to change his mind... so he changes his mind... But now he has, she feels awkward making him do that? I see. Yes. Why do you think? That's what I don't understand. For my friend. Your friend is you, isn't it? - This being too complicated. - No, it's not about me. Let's just say it's you. It's natural to want to be by his side if you like him. But the thing is... He wanted to go to Tokyo before we hooked up. So it's because of me. - Bean bun? - Bean bun? Here. Have it if you want. - It's out of date. - It's fine. Thank you. So, he decided to go to Tokyo before he confessed to me. He only told me after the fact. Doesn't he think about the consequences? That's just how guys are. What? Not thinking of the consequences. He acts before he thinks, I am the same kind of guy. That's it. Well, haven't you ever found yourself clinging to something, after acting impulsively without thinking? - Eh? - Probably not. - Not really. - I have a long time ago. At the time I didn't consider the future at all. I just thought "I LIKE YOU." Yeah. So guys will just act. Everyone says that's not the girl's responsibility. I don't think it is. Those are the good guys. That friend's... boyfriend? My friend's boyfriend. He's a good guy. "Good guy"? Also, didn't he change his mind for her? - Yes. - He's really something then. He's one of a kind. Your friend must be really happy, here. Woah, you surprised me, thank you. Happy? Guys usually don't change their minds. My dream is important so... so you'll have to wait for me. Like that. Right? But that's... - That? - That guy has really thought... He's really thought things through. So he's really thought about it and decided, he wants to be with her. That's really nice. But I don't know what to do from here. That is that it's only in your own interest. You asked him not to go, so he's not going, so now what. I'm really happy that he changed his mind, because of me. So it's my fault he isn't going. I feel really guilty. It's not that I'm terrible but, I just don't know what to do. For example, they have their whole lives ahead of them. Thinking about how much time they will have together as a couple. Is it in their best interest for him to quit this one small thing right now. Think about how much time we will be together? Together as a... Together forever as a couple, They can either spend the next few years together, or he can go to Tokyo. From which they can spend the rest of their lives together, which is best for them? But what if they can't be together? What if he finds someone in Tokyo? He might. He might, Tokyo's amazing. - What is... - I've been there. I was in shock. - Huh? - Shibuya. Shibuya? It's... frightening. - Frightening? - I can't go back there. What is it? There are demons there. I can't let him go. But there, he could really reach his full potential. He could really turn into something. To let someone you like accomplish something like that. I haven't been to Tokyo, I haven't been anywhere. I don't have any life experience. He could really study and have some amazing experiences. How would you feel if he returned with all that? - I'd be happy. - You would be so happy right? I want you to think about that. Yes. Give it some thought, there's still some time. Yes. Demons? What if you wrote it down? You should write it down. Huh? Get it all out. Come here and write all your feelings down. Feeling Calligraphy. Write how you feel right now. Go. Don't go. "Go." Go. Go. That's how I feel right now. Whose? My friend's. Come with me. - What is it? - Just come with me. Why... What's wrong? Just come. Hey, I'm asking you what's going on. - Where are we going. - Just do it. Do what exactly? Everyone's looking, Hiro. They're looking at us. Just over here. Where is this. - What? - Excuse me. Come on. Teacher. What's wrong? Please let him go to Waseda University. Huh!? Please! Who wants this? - I have no idea what you are doing. - Wait! You want to go, right? So come one. Please. How do you... really feel? I don't want to go. - You want to. - I don't. He wants to go. He really wants to. So please let him. You have completely flipped. Don't go... Now, Go. What do you really think, Shinozaki? Konno is saying she wants you to go. Alright then. You have to make this decision soon. I want to go. I want to go. Please. Please. OK then. I'll support you. Go to Waseda. If I go see you, do you think you will have a new girlfriend? Huh? I won't. Their feet... kind of like this... like this... A waist like this. Stand like this. Like this? What's the ratio of how much we like each other? Hmm. 1 and 5 litre. You are 1 litre. I am 5 litres. Then give me the 4 litres. I am lonely now. You have to give it to me now. So give me the 4 litres. No! Stupid! Stupid! I'm not stupid. - Don't get so upset. - I'm upset! You stupid! So loud. Don't start crying again. - He's making fun of me again. - Of course it's not real. Stupid! Get off! Don't come up here. - Why do you have to go to Tokyo!? - Dangerous! That's dangerous. Why are you going to Tokyo? - Stupid. - Dangerous, dangerous. That is really dangerous. There there. That's not enough, stupid! I got it. This is tiring. Come on! No way. Sorry! Free throw competition? Let's get the order. Paper-Scissors-Rock. - Eh? - What number? - Number 1. - First? Then 2nd. What should we wager? - Anything... - Cheesecake. Really, Cheesecake? Think I can get a three-pointer? No. I can't get it right. Take one. Take it of this view. - Like this? - Yes, place of memories. When you put it like that it's hard to take. Remember. OK. Don't. You're not going to need a keepsake of me. 'Cause this isn't over. Someone woke up on their deathbed today. What do you mean deathbed? Remember. The radius is... Tears are coming. Next question. - Starts with 'H'. - Starts with 'H'? - Last letter? - 'Y'. 'Y'? Don't know it. - Why? - Why!? I'll tell you then. - Harf-way. - Harf-way? Remember it. Write it down. Isn't it Half-way? It's Harf-way... You say Half-way, not Harf-way... It's Harf-way. It's got to be. See, there's no 'R' here. It's 'L' so But it's "half" Normally, for things in the middle you say "half." Half-way then. - Harf-way sounds better actually. - It's Half-way. Huh? So we'll use Harf-way. How long do I do this for? Until it's ready. "Until it's ready"? When's... - But it all in? - Yes, all in. Would that be enough oil? Put some more in. And some hearts. Cute. Delicious. - Got everything? - Yes. I'll be back. - Be careful. - I'm off. See you soon. I'm sorry. Oh... you scared me. Oh... hey, it's Hiro. Why are you here? I don't know. Why are you here, hey... why you here? Don't know. We took this road a lot. School was just down the road. - Together. - Yep. Should we hold hands? If we can. So warm. Yeah. - It's really pretty. - Isn't it. Aren't the clouds low. Clouds low? Chitou city is 1550 yen. 1550yen? It's so quiet. Why does this feel like a depressing scene? Don't know. Your train it's here. It's coming. Over there. No way. Hurry. Take care. Good luck. An announcement. What the... Shu likes me. What's with that. I'm next? Hiro likes me. An announcement. Go ahead. I don't want you to go to Tokyo. I don't want you to. Yes? CAST KIE KITANO MASAKI OKADA English Subtitles by dis'ko
