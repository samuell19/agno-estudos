THE RIVER GIRL - Hi, Gino. - Hi. Hey, Gino. Tosca looks so sad. Go give the poor baby a kiss. I'm afraid Tosca is here today and she's too quiet for him. Calm down, you ladies all smell the same. - Nives too? - No, Nives smells like jasmine. Let's see. - Rude ass! - Yes, already. I have not come to bite you. Be careful because in a moment my fist will come to turn your face upside down. Come on, Nives. Wow, what a character your friend is, huh? At least you, Lia, are much kinder. Yeah, that's because you're a rough brute and I like men like that. I might be a rude ass, but you are crazy. It is perfectly clear that you need a boyfriend. Come on, Gino. Why? Would you like to make love to me? Hey? Come on. - You come? - Yes. Morning. I was almost beginning to believe that I really was a flower. But what type of flower? Come here with a car. You will see what he also wants. I wish, but for now I only have a motorcycle. Then wait. - Why? - Can you take us home with the barge? Yes, but the free ride is going to end soon. Nives! Nives! Aren't you coming with us on Gino's boat? No, Tosca, you go on ahead. Isn't Tosca coming with us? She's coming over in Gino's boat. - Bye, Tosca. - Bye, Gino. Thank you. See you soon. - Bye, Tosca. - Goodbye, Gianluca. Oscar! - You can't see the boat. - They leave it in the sea. The authorities don't get here. In my opinion, no one has arrived yet. Closed. Someday those thieves will show up on time. You... hey you! No one has turned up yet, have they? They are all in there sleeping. Tonight the sea is very rough. Well. Wow, what a horrible stench! Oscar! - Go in there and find out what they brought us. - Right away. Hand it over. Let's see what they brought us this time. Boys! Up! Everyone get up! Lucky... Pall Mall... Hey, we checked that stuff. Good Turkish stuff, Egyptian, American... A pity how turbulent the sea was for this trip three sacks of cigarettes ended up in the water. The sea was too rough. With what it cost us... But we could not avoid some loss. Three sacks is a big loss. Hey man! Come here, man! What are you up to? This material is still ours. I'm telling you, Gino, this time the price needs to be higher, do you understand? It's okay. I'm taking these. What? How much is there? It's what we had discussed. Look, Gino, we have lost three sacks and need to raise the price, we need to go back and renegotiate the price to agree, do you understand? You're kidding? We had agreed on the price. 140 for the package. I'm not giving you one more franc. Take it or leave it. Oh yeah? This you will regret. We are leaving. And you for the Pall Mall... stay waiting. If the police catch up with us, we'll be the ones behind bars. Yes, yes, it ends now... If you had a conscience you wouldn't do this. You wouldn't do that to poor people. Bring here. Goes... Damn! Hey Chioggia! How do we stand with each other? - We look pretty bad. - When we will meet again? Goodbye. Gino, there are ten cartons of the long cigarettes. Do we take them upstairs? What do I care? Give me the flashlight. Right away. Hurry up. I'm going down to the boat. Do I keep these cigarettes? Yes, but hurry up I'm not going to wait for you. Come on, Oscar. Run. - Nives, listen to one thing. - Go, I'm in a hurry. Won't the policeman be looking for you by chance? My name is not... Lodi... Gino. What do you mean? I don't know... I'm going to do my thing. - Come on, let's make it up. - Let me. Listen girls I have the boat here. I upload you all and I take you home. Hey, Nives, are you coming too? Yes tomorrow. You bitch! Come on, girls, let's go. - What do you care Nives? - That one's scared. Look, look at her. Nives! Nives! How unfriendly she is. Nives, is it true that Gino has not got any love from you? Gino says he's made love with you. I can't hear anything. Enough already, huh? A man has yet to be born that can make that woman lose her mind. - Goodbye. - Bye, Nives. Stop! You mother effers! Stop! Stop! I have identified you! You are both from San Pietro! Stop! Come on, hurry up! Quickly! Come on, hurry up! Run, so he doesn't catch you. Come on, Cinti. - Courage, he's old. - Stop or you will pay dearly! Life is hard, huh, Cinti? Why don't you try next time to put a bell on their tails? Yes, you also take your part. Me? And what have I done? Who were they? - Ah! I don't know them. - Great. Those who hang out with criminals, is either a criminal or will soon become one. Maybe. But one is not a criminal just because you say so. And besides, I'm not that prissy. To those who are nice to me, I say "hello". Yes, nice excuse there are always thieves. - And society has to defend itself. - I have to go. Not. Stay a bit. Why are you laughing? Because you have come to consider me a criminal. And if I am such a delinquent, why is it you are always haunting me? Do not speak such foolishness. I could be your father. Ah... such a handsome daddy! - I pity you, because you do not know what you say. - I know it very well. Do you think that I have not realized that, since I have no father and I live alone, You try so hard with me with the excuse of wanting to protect me? Good afternoon Boss. Good afternoon, Luciani. Nives. Don't you think about getting married? No, Cinti, I still haven't thought about that. When I do, I'll give you a whistle. Goodbye, Cinti, goodbye. Good afternoon, Nives. Come on, this time too we arrived earlier. Hello! Can you give me dinner? Am I staying to sleep tonight? You ignorant imbecile! - Sorry, I didn't seen you there. - It would have been better if you did get me wet. - And why is that? - Because if you did get me all wet, Then you would have to let me in to dry my pants. You are delusional... Sweet chimera... Are you afraid that I will eat you if you let me into the house? This is always crowded. Who? Gave. - Tosca, Mar√≠a, Mercedes, - Caterina, Teresa, the entire union. I have not entered your house since the time of the Germans. You men you are all like the Germans. To make you respect you only know one system. Hey, girl, not even that I was Cinti. You don't know who you're talking to. Yes, I know quite well. And now run and go take care of your dirty activities. And what do you know about what I do? - I know everything. - Be careful about what you speak about. If you want to know, I have all the documents in order. I have a lawyer brother. Yes, a lawyer of lost causes. - That's not true. - What difference does it make? Even if you have a lawyer brother and a mother teacher, you're still a ruffian. Like a ruffian? I work. Shut up, it suits you. We know what your job is. Go on, leave, go. And leave me in peace since I work all day long. We'll see you tomorrow at the dance. Hi, Gino. Hi. Shit! Just who is that impressive girl? Miss... Miss... May I have a dance? - Nice local, huh? - Yes. Are you from Comacchio? Yes, up close. I am from Valle Cavallo. - Have you ever been? - No. I drove here on my motorcycle. - Hey, waiter! - What! - A bitter! - Right away! Oh sorry! It was not on purpose. Excuse me. Forgiven. You stopped dancing, why? Don't you see who can't dance? Learn to dance before you come here to dance and after that, come back and try again. Miss! Miss Nives! Hey, go over there! What are you doing here? Get off the track! And where do you play on Sunday? In Coticoro. Are you coming too? Who knows? I don't really want to see them lose. If you come to see me, I'm sure I could score two goals. - A brandy. - We do not have license for alcoholic beverages. He has offended you, huh, Massimo? If you think you're going to make me mad... Come on, guys. We better go drink. What are we doing here? - Yes, but pay. - I don't pay anything. Yes, as always without paying. Hey, master! Put that one on! Right away! Ice creams! Ice creams! - Do you like to pose? - I like very much. This rhythm tires me. A candy! Do you want to become the dancer? Pay! What is variety? Other. How rude! Look at the ruckus they're making. Who are they? Who do you think they are? The usual three or four thugs. Enough of that! Show some class and good manners. We come here to dance. Why is it that nobody is capable of talking to those thugs? - Hey, adolescents! - What is your problem, bro? - When are you going to leave? - Leave it yourself. - You're rude! - There is no place for you here. Come over here. What are you waiting for? See you later on. I will teach you proper manners. Put on your high heels, you pygmy dwarf! Look, what a horse face dwarf! It is always her fault. Miss Covacchio. - Easy, let's get out of here. - Let me. - Moron. - You are a profiteer. Gino! Gino! - You will pay for this! - Die! - Come on or it'll end badly. - Come on, come on, Gino! The carabinieri! Let me! Look... we better get out or We will end up in jail, with you going in first. The carabinieri! - Have you been on a motorcycle before? - No never! - Do You like it? - No! - Are you afraid? - No! Oh my God! - Slow down! - Go even slower! - I told you to slow down! - If I go slower! You stinking asshole!! I'm telling you to stop! Hold on tight or you will fall! Instead of impressing me, you have achieved the opposite! If I had some sympathy for you before, now I don't even want to see you again! You will want to see me more! Every time you see me your heart skips! You are trash! That's what you are! Oh yeah, so now I'm trash? Instead of thanking me having saved you! If I didn't get you out of there, they would have lynched you! And they would have done well! Oh my God. I told you to stop! What's the matter? You feel bad? Where? In the pit of the stomach. Don't be silly! It is nothing. You will see how that passes as soon as we stop. Where do you want to go? To your house or to mine? Look at me jumping off! Moron! That is going to kill both of us! How are we doing now? Better? Has your stomach ache gone? Do you want me to stop? What if you want us to stop! Nives! Nives! - What time is it? - It's almost seven. It's late. You are not ready yet. What are you going to do? Look this morning I am not going to the factory. - Why? - My head hurts, I don't feel well. It hurts me a lot. You have a fever? I'm going to come inside for a moment. No, no, go, go or you will be be late and penalized. We will see you later this afternoon. Please notify the casting manager. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Poor inocent. Yes. You can lie very well, huh? - I didn't imagine it. - Why? Did you want me to have told her about us? And what would be so wrong if she knew about us? What are those? - They command me respect. - Why? You do not like them? Put them on. They were from my mother. - Do you remember mom? - I remember. You won't believe it but a mile from here I could smell food. - Well, then, tell me what it is. - Wait. Wait. I'm not sure Do not say anything. - Cod! - Yes, cod! - So what's up? - Look. Get away! Get those dirty hands away! The Virgin Mary, what a character! Naples 1 to 1. In Novara, Novara beats Bologna, 1 to 0. In Ferrara, Spaldi-Turin, 1 to 1. The classification... Gino. Come here with me. Where are you going? - Is there traffic tonight too? - No, today is Sunday. I have seven. What would you do if you won the pool? Leave it if it never touches me. But imagine it's your turn. If I won, I know what I would do. First, goodbye to to Comacchio. Then a nice convertible. To travel. That's. - That's the first. - Travel, what a dream! To go where? And when you've spent the money What do you have left. And what do you think of? Let's see. Many. Practical, not like yours. I may be an idiot. But I am a simple person that is satisfied with little. A classic bedroom, a full kitchen, - a good Singer sewing machne, that's what I want. - Oh yeah! And never leave here, right? Nice idea. I'm tired of moving about, let the mosquitoes eat me. On the other hand, even if I won the pool, I would never leave here. I do not know why, but I love this house very much. Quiet. In any case, the pool will not touch us. We are lucky in love. It will be... if you say so. But I assure you that a little money we could use it. I wish we could win the pool. So we could get married, right? To build a house, basically a little is enough. You do not want. Why? Because you are a Judas. Gino. Gino, listen to me for a moment. Listen, don't fall asleep. Tonight surely we will be working overtime. Take the house key. When you go out, leave it under of the stone. Taking. Taking. If you're hungry, everything is ready. Nives! Nives! Come on, Nives! What do you do? I'm going. It's here. I'm going. Goodbye, Gino. See you tonight. Goodbye, cook. - What a rush! - It's late. Are you sleepy? Not because? Why don't you lock it? Never mind. Well, Tosquita, why do you have such a face? You are welcome. And what happens to you that you can't sit still for a moment? Look, Gino. Hi, Gino. What are you doing here? - Tribute to the union. - Yes, to the poor union. You are happy. Are you doing well, huh? - Well, no, very good. - Where were you yesterday that nobody saw you. Yesterday, a whole day of penance. And at night sweet thoughts and now I'm here so clean like a little angel. You get unbearable when you make yourself interesting. How unbearable? Leave the poor man alone. Who knows if by dint of penance Nives becomes moved. No, with Nives there is nothing to do. Is special. And it does well. It is stupendous. Great. It's what you have to do to be respected. - You shut up! - Go, you are all a short cut of traitors. - Who, us? - Yes, you men. Traitors us? Not even in dreams. When a young man goes after a girl, it's true, it has a goal, what is fun but she has it too and boy is this true. The woman, the woman does betray. She makes love, but underneath she does not leave. To do their accounts. A classic bedroom, a full kitchen, a good sewing machine... What I say is that marriage it is the sheer ruin of man. Do you want the stew to be good ...? Go Go! This election is over. Come on! Crazy! Kiss me tonight because the moon will protect us. Because, why, kiss me tonight. We can fall in love... Easy, I was kidding. Come on, let's go. - Hi, Nives. - Good evening. Gino sends me to pick up her... your jacket. It was left here. - Why? - What do you mean why? He is going to Trieste. To Trieste? - And when does he leave? - Now. - And when does he come back? - Who knows? 10 days, a month, one never says. This morning he came home and said "pack my suitcase I have to go." Well, good night, Nives. Goodnight. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Well, what did the police want financial? They're going crazy with the tobacco smugglers. They have come to ask us that we give them a hand. Information. In short, what we see and we hear when we are on duty. And what have you told them? Nothing Why? We already have enough with the eels. The rest does not interest us. And besides, I like to live and let others live. Goodbye. - Good afternoon, Nives. - Good afternoon. Are you still wrong? What am I going to be wrong? What I have is a dream that I fall. You're very kind always preparing it for me. That is why, at night, when I fold. I come to make you a visit. Anyway, - I have to do it for myself. - Thank you. Tell me, Have you been to the mutual to see the doctor? Again... And yet it is useless. You have something that is not working. And if you are not sick, you have to have some depression. It's not like that? I'm fine. I have work, I don't need to eat everyone loves me. On Sundays I have fun. What a depression I'm going to have! Yes, can be. What are you doing to yourself. When I see you knit. I still like you more. I know well that you are not in love with me. But in marriage in the Christian union, it is not sensual love that counts. I'm not looking for that love, Nives. For me true love is something else. You agree with me? What a dream! I know what happens to you. Gino Lodi! I'm wrong? Whoever told you that is a poor idiot. We haven't seen each other for two months. No, yes, I know. Travels a lot. A smart guy. You think it's here and it's there. You think it is there and it is here. Whoever puts his hand on it it has to be pretty good. And yet. If you want... I do not want anything. You see, Nives, I've always known everything. - Everything? - All. What it does and what it has done to you. How gladly would I ruin that scoundrel If I could catch it red-handed. You should help me. I don't want to help anyone. You are not right. With certain individuals that only hurt there is no need to have mercy. They have to be sent to jail. Good night, Cinti. Think about it. Goodnight. Hey kid, come here. Do you know where Gino Lodi is? There. Hey, Gino. Where are you going? I have to talk to you. We're going over there. What is this procession? Come on out. So, Are you still mad? - I came back from Trieste yesterday. - Is not true. You've been back for two weeks. You know... I've thought about it a lot. I haven't been very good to you. - We make peace? - Listens. If I have come, it is for one thing. Be careful that the guards they are looking for you. - They look for me? Why? - For smuggling. They know everything about you. The only thing they don't know yet it's from the forest shed where you keep things. You had scared me. But to you... - Who told you that they are looking for me? - I know and that's enough. I have warned you. And now goodbye. Wait a minute. But... if you have been so kind to come here you... you are different from the others. - I'm like the others. - Not. Oh no. You are the most beautiful. Plus... you have heart. And you even pamper one you may not deserve it. What a pity! - What is a pity? - Nothing. I thought that if it hadn't happened what happened it would be very nice to hear what you're saying. Why, Nives? Everything can be again as beautiful as at the beginning. Nerd. Only once in life. I knew it from the beginning. For you men, it may be different. But for us women it is so. You're already exaggerating. What has happened? World's End? What happened? Has passed... that I am going to have a child. That is why you have come. The thing about the guards was an excuse. You are going to have a child. And with whom? Scoundrel! You are all the same. Scoundrel! What do you wish, Miss? - I want to speak to the lieutenant. - Come in, I'll accompany you. Hey, Pietro! But what are you doing? Stay still and don't be silly. Pass. Enters. Stay here. Give me the handcuffs. Stop there! Surround it. Freeze or I'll shoot! Go back to the booth. Continue with the registration. Then I'll send you the jeep. Still. Still there. You will see what it costs you this pretty feat. Although it takes ten years, she will pay me. She will pay me, that dirty pelantrusca that she has sold me. She will pay me. You want? Excuse me, is the lady at home? She has gone shopping. Where? To the haberdashery on the corner. Thank you very much. - As soon as I arrive I will let you know. - Yes thanks. - This week. - Okay, I'll come. Good morning, Mrs. Tosca. Good morning, Cinti. How is it going? Well. I see... - you have made purchases for your little girl. - Yes. It started in kindergarten. - How old are you? - Almost two years. Mrs. Tosca, I wanted to ask you one thing. Won't you by chance know where can I find Nives? Since I got married, we have not seen each other again. - But you were very good friends. - Yes, we were very close friends. And for me it still is. I got married, it's true. Then one here, the other there. This is life. But she changed. After the story with Gino Lodi, it became bad. I did not look anyone in the face, not even me. It was like not even we met. And later, you know what happens, it was no longer seen here in Comacchio. And at home... - haven't tried ...? - She's been gone for a month. Nobody knows where. But I have to find her. Then she has gotten well. In the head. No, no, it's not because of what you think. If you know where Nives works now, be good and tell me, please. If I only knew, with pleasure. Look, it's for your good. I'm only looking for her for her sake. So, what they say is true, that Gino Lodi has escaped. It is not true. Who told you that stupid? You really don't know where can Nives be? I don't know exactly. I have heard that the poor thing, like here She did not have a job, she went to cut cane there. In the Po delta. And now goodbye. - I have to go. - Goodbye Mrs. Tosca and thank you very much. And I'm sorry if I have bothered you. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Excuse me a moment. - Tell me. Could you tell me where you cut reeds? - No, I do not know. - Where they cut the reeds... is still missing. The Barda. It has to cross the delta of the Po. And then three hours by boat. Listen to me for a moment. It is very far where do they cut the reeds? I do not know, What reeds? The gray hair. The peaks of the reeds. It's those things... Those things that are used to make the brooms. Look, those over there. Ah, the feathers! La Vegna is there. La Vegna! La Vegna! Do you see the lighthouse? Yes Yes. Those who cut the reeds They are in the houses in the middle. With the motorcycle, how long? He cannot go with the motorcycle. There is water in between. There come people back home from working in the reeds. Excuse me a moment. Do you know, by chance, a certain Nives Mangolini? - Mangolini Nives? - Yes. I do not think so. What do you want, sir? There are quite a few Nives. - Good evening. - Good evening. Look sir. If you are at the lighthouse in the morning, my father accompanies him in the boat. Okay, thanks. And to sleep? Here you can, if that's okay with you. Ah, bandit. Bandit! Tonin! Where have you hidden coaxer? Where? Where? Give mom a kiss. Give mommy a kiss. Let's clean the little nose. And now we are going to eat. But do not cry. Come on, Nives, it's late. You have too much money saved. And you don't want to work anymore. Do not worry. Even if I'm late, before Night falls short more reeds than all of you. Don't cry, sweetie. Now we eat. Lots, lots of food. Let's go for the bib. Do you see Bambi? Bambi... Taking. You have to eat fast, fast because then mom goes to work. And so she makes a lot of money and this winter buys you a nice easy chair. Agree? Here is the food. How hungry my treasure is! God, how handsome you are! Look what you've done, bad! Another ungrateful. Already starts not to care about the people who love him. No you must not cry because you get ugly. Look, Ivana. You see? Come on, Ivana, you finish. Taking. Take your food. Eat what mom come back soon tonight. Voucher? Come, come, eat. I beg you to be very careful. At noon feed her. That everything is ready, you have understood? Yes, yes, go easy, Nives. And please blow her nose I can't see it like that. Goodbye. Say goodbye to mom. Say goodbye. Mom will be back. Hey kids. Listen. Doesn't a woman from Comacchio work here what is called nives? Mangolini, Nives. Be good. Why don't you answer? I'm not going to eat you. This one here, will not be... Isn't it, maybe, Tonin? The child of Nives. Yes sir. And your mother, where is he now? It is outside, at the mouth of the Po, cutting the reeds. And when does it come back? Tonight. Is far? On foot, a half hour. Nor is it much. Well. - Come on, join me. - Yes sir. - Ivana! - Mary. Ivana! What are you doing here? Get back to the river right away, stupid. What has crossed your mind to leave the children alone! Get out of here, if I catch you, I'll kill you. Go away. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good Morning. Does Nives Mangolini work here? Mangolini Nives. Yes. Where is? I do not know. It must be later, on that side. Nives. Look who arrives. Are you here too? Well, what do you want? Talk to you, if you allow me. Do you know that you're still more beautiful? Will be. The bad thing is that always it's you who tells me. Already. Unfortunately, My name is not Gino Lodi. You have made it very clear to me during these two years, in Comacchio. But... before you left you could having fired you from an old friend. Enough of the speeches. I don't care about Gino Lodi, neither you nor your friendship. Now I only care about my son and I am not interested in any of them. Why do you speak with that tone? Why do you always do that, Nives? Word of honor, I don't understand you. Do you think this is life? It's worse than jail. I understand that you could not continue living in Comacchio. But you know what... I have my mother in Ferrara and a house... Enough! Enough! Enough! Why? Why, in the name of God? Why? Try to understand me, Nives. - Try at least to reason. - What reason? Leave me alone and go. I'm sick of you and your ugly face of profiteers. Watch out! Have you gone crazy? Let at least to tell you why I have come. - I have something to tell you. - What? Gino escaped from jail yesterday. I know I was wrong. What I just did. You shouldn't have. Sorry. But I lost my mind and... I am miserable. Who knows why, but with you I am never capable to guess the right moment. I came here just for your sake, Nives. I wanted to help you. I thought: Gino has escaped from jail, and he will only have one idea. Get revenge. So when you got angry. I told you to come to Ferrara with my mother. Don't you understand that you are in danger? Don't you understand that if Gino comes looking for you, that he capable of killing you for what you did to him? Listen carefully, Nives. Listen carefully, Nives. Now there is only one way out. You have to listen to me. Have confidence. Come to my house, with my mother, in Ferrara. You and the child. Only then can you save yourself. And I'm not saying it for you or for me but for him. For your son. Are you listening to me, Nives? Come on, let's go. There is no time to lose. That scoundrel can arrive at any moment. I'm glad that Gino has escaped. You don't understand what you are saying. If he comes, I'll wait for him. And if it kills me I was wrong. And I deserve it. Want it or not help you, I know my duty. Goodbye. Gioi! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18... - Gildo, listen. - Sit down. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31. Who is inside is inside And who's out is out 1, 2, 3, you are out. - Renzo, who were you with? - I was alone. Giovanni gets out of the boat. Bruno, Berto, Rossano They are behind the plants in the background. Stop being silly and get out. You are all out now. Look how scared he is. You still have to find Pina, Valeria and Sergio. Come on, move on. We are hidden in the cellar. Hidden. Well that's it. Now it's your turn. - We have to find Tonin. - Tonin is only two years old. Anyway, you have to look for him. Tonin! That is going to look for you! What do you want the poor man to understand? I can not find him. Who knows where there will be hidden that liante? Tonin! Get out or call mom! Tonin! Tonin! Tonin! Hey guys we are going to search among the reeds. Tonin! Are you here? Tonin! Tonin! Come on, Ivana. Stop crying. Stupid, you could have noticed before. Come on, Ivana, cheer up, they will find him. Men have come looking for him and they will find him among the reeds. Who knows where he will have gone with those legs. Stop saying no that gives me a rage that would kill you. It has been the gypsies, they have taken him away. You are crazy. There are no gypsies here. They are in town... Ivana is right. Gypsies passed through here. They played the drum and sang. - Stop stories. - Yes Yes. One has even given her a kiss. The blackest has kissed Tonin - and did not want. - Is it true, Gildo? - It is true? - Yes Yes. Men, men, all come here. There are the gypsies. It is the gypsies who have taken Tonin. But what an idea is that! But Tassi! We are not in the old days! Have passed this morning while they were alone! Damn gypsy witches! Mens Mens, take the boats and go! Go to the boats! Tonin. Tonin. Come with mom. Nives. Where are you going? Come. Help me. He was behaving so well this morning. Playing next to me in the sand. So quiet, you couldn't even hear him. He had given her the meat in small pieces. Suddenly he was hungry. And he ate it all. Then that man came that he told me to accompany him to look for you. It's not my fault. - Ivana. - Nives. How strong! And you can't even see it. Oh God, the stream. Nives. Nives! Nives! Tonin! - Where did you find him? - In the background, almost at the lighthouse. Oh my God, up there the river had carried him away. Poor thing. Poor treasure of his mother. - So handsome he was. - Poor innocent creature. They have left their home, poor little one, for not having a room as it should. We are worse than gypsies. Ana, for crying out loud, make sure they are quiet. Shut up! Shut up! Is it you, Gino? Yes. It has gotten late. I was beginning to worry. Has something bad happened? - Where are they? - Still out. If they get close, they run aground. With this sea they couldn't get any closer. Now they come with the little boat. They wait for it to be night. There is not a lighthouse. You will have no need. You are serious, Gino. I understand, I understand. But it's always better outside than in jail. Abroad, for a young man like you, it is a new life. I remember when we came to Corfu to Thessaloniki, to Smyrna, to Istanbul, in those parts. So many women! So many! With the hunger for women that we had after so many months at sea. And, in addition, the Italian league a lot. Hey! Hey! That you fall asleep. Nerd. Freedom comes first. I think so. Hey, Gino, someone's coming. - What does that sign mean? - That the boat is in the sea. Goodness. - The carabinieri, the police know I'm around. - Really, Gino? Stay, I'm going to watch. Wait! Gino! We are ready! You know what... Gino! Gino! I do not get it. He was here just now. He has disappeared. Gino! Gino! Are you the Brigade? There. Good morning, Mr. Brigade. What happens? I am Gino Lodi. Wait a minute, Mr. Brigade. It's my son's funeral. Mr. Brigade, I only need half an hour. Take off the handcuffs. Go. THE END
