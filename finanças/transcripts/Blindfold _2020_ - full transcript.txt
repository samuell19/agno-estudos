Faster! Faster! Come on, push it. Faster. Come on. Overweight. Do you want to be reweighed? Let's do it. 56kg 900g. It's OK. Has it affected your preparation for the fight? Losing weight right before a fight is a very normal practice. We are 100% ready. I have a question for Lyudmyla. Has your military service interfered with your preparation for your first professional fight in the ring? On the contrary, it has only helped me to better prepare. Olha Movchan, "Free" TV channel. I have a question for Yulia. Will you dedicate tomorrow's fight to Denis Skorozub? Tomorrow's fight is dedicated to everyone who has lost their lives in the East of Ukraine. But I'm asking Yulia to answer this question. Yulia doesn't answer stupid questions! Has anybody actually seen his body? And that was the last question in our press conference, it is over. Thank you, everybody. Have you seen the body? Are those guys from your club? Screw you. "Help for the army" Damn it, watch where you're going. Leave him alone. Let him raise money for the army. The war has been over a while. The army no longer needs money. Wait a minute. I'll give you some. Open the door, please. Wait for the stop. I told you, wait for the bus stop! Sports lane, 1. Which floor? I don't understand. Guess what, neither do I. Is this a taxi? It's a spaceship. Are we going or not? Yes, but it'll cost you a lot. I'm Max. Good for you. Are you training there? Green light. Hey! Wait, it was a joke. Yulia, hello. Good afternoon. Who's that? Denis. Attacking a cripple? Hi. If I were one of them, would you treat me differently? Listen. Find yourself a girlfriend, for God's sake. Not everyone is like you. Like who? My girlfriend dumped me and got married. She didn't wait like you are doing. Be glad you even came back alive. Denis, Denis, Denis. Yesterday I found this DVD in my stuff. I thought you'd need it more than me. You won't find this on the Internet. No, thanks. Look how he fought. I know. OK. I'll leave it here. You can pick it up whenever you want. Do it for him tomorrow. Yes! Good! Oleg. Get her warmed up properly. Maybe you won't wait for him anymore? Faster. Right. Yulia, do exactly that but in the ring! Final stop. Good morning. Yulia Volenko? Yes. This is for you. "This wonderful flower reminds me of you the most. Max, the Yellow Leon" Let me introduce you all to the beautiful charming Mia. You are a bright fire in your own life. I am a risk to you, but you want me. Forever from now, you'll be my number one. I feel your defense, you are my amulet. Living without you means fooling myself. Forever from now. You'll be my number one. Some guy is trying to see Yulia. Alright. You know who it is? Weight - 56,9 kg, Height - 168 cm. Age - 25. 9 victories and 1 loss. She's nothing. You can do it. Yulia. Volenko. Ludmila. Yulia. Ludmila. Yulia. Ludmila. Yulia. Before the fight tonight, I ask everybody for a moment of silence for the three men who lost their lives in the East of Ukraine on this day one year ago. We dedicate this evening to them. Evgen Tarnavsky. Ivan Sorokevych. Denis Skorozub. We remember. Glory to the Heroes. You are professionals. Protect yourselves, respect each other, Follow my instructions. Touch gloves. Return to your corners. Are you ready? Ready? Fight. Push it, push it. Good! Good! C'mon! Ludmila. Ludmila. Ludmila. What happened? C'mon, Yulia, c'mon. Stop Finish her. Why do we need all of this? It's necessary. Just focus on your opponent, Yulia. Fight. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Ludmila. Ludmila. Ludmila. What happened? Protect yourself, Yulia. Push it. Hold, Yulia, hold! Stop. Yulia, what happened? Is everything okay? Yes. You good to continue? Yes, absolutely. Сoncentrate. What's going on? Fight. Protect yourself! Hands! Protect yourself! Defend yourself! Protect yourself! Protect yourself! Ludmila. Ludmila. Ludmila. What's wrong with you? What are you doing? Stop. Yulia, what was that? Stop please. Should I also leave? You want some? Why did you do this? I'm not asking you why you did that. Take me home. Stop. I said stop. Right here. You're crazy! What did you expect? Come on, jump in. Are you afraid? Of you? Let's go. Why are you barking? Quiet now, quiet. Stop barking at this brave girl. Come on. How did you find me? Hi, Yulia dear. I'm sorry I probably woke you up. No, I was just getting ready. Fresh milk. You shouldn't have. But Denis likes it. Are you feeling OK? Sit down. You are not feeling well, are you? Do you have enough money to pay the rent? I told you, you could stay at my place. Everything is fine. ОK. Hey, I've bought a device for canning. Soon we can enjoy canned cucumbers and tomatoes. It was so nice yesterday, so many soldiers. If only my Denis had been there. Why did you say that? I'm just imagining, what will happen when he returns. What for? OK, I'll be there. I have to go to the club. Right now? Well, then I go. We'll talk later. Of course. Also, I wanted to ask you... What? It's not important, another time. Never mind. Alright. Bye. Yulia. Everybody's looking for you. I know. Is it because of that man? I saw him. Yesterday he came here again. You'd better go back to work, Mrs. Zenya Yeah, strangers come in all the time. I managed to get us a technical knockout. I'm discussing a possibility of a rematch fight. Sit down. Sit and drink. There will be no more fights. I quit. What's going on, child? What does this mean? For thirteen years you and I have slept on floors, roads, trains, ate cheap pastries for lunch. Remember when I bought you tangerines? And what now? That little girl who loved tangerines is gone. That's all. Are you trying to impress me with a new car? It worked though. Tell me what happened there? No. We're on a date, right? Call it whatever you want, but we need to order some food. What would you like? I don't know. Yes, sir. We'd like something light, We're on a diet, aren't we Yulia? Understand. In this case you'd enjoy our specialty "Cacciatore". Just water, please. What kind of water? Still. Two Cacciatore", water. Thank you. What do you usually do on a date? I dance. Don't even think about that. You won't go to the dancefloor with me? It's just like the ring, only with music. Let's talk about this in the ring. One minute, please. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As always, we've prepared a special surprise for you, and today we're learning how to tango. Let's welcome Antonio Rubinas. Everyone is welcome to join. Don't look at me, I told you I won't dance. Neither will I. Antonio, where is your partner? Don't step on my feet. Nice, one more time. By yourself now. C'mon. C'mon. You have the skills to be a good dancer. I am serious. Why are half of your shelves empty? Did you just move in? Or did someone just... Move out? No. Then why are they empty? Some people don't only live for themselves. What does that mean? These empty shelves are for my future wife. You're joking. No. What about the empty room? That'll be the nursery. I don't get why you're laughing. I'm starting to get scared of you. I haven't offered you anything yet. And don't try to. Will this "Scar-man" or whatever you call him be there? Oleg? I don't know. They're not going to beat me up, are they? They will. Hi guys. This is Andriyich, the best coach in the world. And this is Oleg, whom you met already. This is "Bear" and Sasha. And this is Max. Good evening. Nice to meet you. Of course. A drink? Why not, I can have one. Guys let's do shots? It's self-service here. My treat. As people return to Donbas to their homes, in the Crimea everything is just beginning. Yesterday was the largest pro-Ukrainian demonstration in recent times. Ukraine is Europe! Crimea is Europe! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes! Took them long enough. You think it's that simple? Of course not as simple as, let's say, pulling on a fire alarm. Well then, cheers to Yulia. Did you like Yulia's fight? She is awesome, very talented. Then why are you against her staying in the sport? She can decide for herself. I've known Yulia since she was 11. We've been through a lot together - haven't we, Yulia? You're telling me rubbish. It's her decision. Are you a cop or what? I'm a lawyer. It seems like you think you're her lawyer. I'm not her dad, and neither are you. Andriyich, I can train the kids, and be at the gym all the time. She'll go to that crook. He just opened a travel agency. Great offer! Why not? Yulia what about Egypt, Turkey. All inclusive. Can you see that he doesn't get what we're talking about? I need to go. The last bus leaves soon. See everyone tomorrow at the gym, and don't be late. Take care, lawyer. "Bear", pay up. Listen, Yulia. Denis would walk into fire for you. This one isn't even worth his little finger. Denis is gone. I see, Yulia is also gone. Yes, because everyone has buried me next to him. Nice talk. Nice talk. Good luck. Look who's here – Yulia. Piss off. Easy, easy. Take that smile off your face! Calm down, Calm down. They will figure it out. Easy, boys! You punch like a girl. You don't know anything about the war. Happy now? You don't understand what the hell you're doing. I hate you all. Let's go. Calm down for God sake. Loony. I like it here. Do you want me to give you a second punch? I'm serious. I hate this apartment. This is a special cream, so you don't look like a spaceman tomorrow. Do you feel like a real fighter now? That was nothing. Yeah, yeah, nothing. Close your eyes, OK? And now? Much better. I'm so glad you're here. Yulia sit. What happened? Please sit down. Denis is alive. I was at the S.S.U. already. (Security Service of Ukraine) Why is the S.S.U involved? Because it's not within the police's jurisdiction. Read it. I got this text message this morning. From a doctor. We just need to immediately raise 50 000 hryvnias for his surgery. It's only a message. We don't even know anything. I already started collecting things that we can sell. We have time until morning. You must have some of his things right? Stop now! You want to sell Denis's stuff? Yes. Trophies, gloves? It is stupid. It's not right. Yulia, but all that is worth nothing compared to his life, right? It's only a message. Wake up Yulia. It's not. In the dresser. Who was that? Denis Skorozub's mom. And who's he? A friend. Why is his stuff here? He's a friend from our fight club, he left his stuff with me when he went away. We just got a text from the East that he's alive. When did you get it? Today. We need to check this. There should be an attendant at this station. You OK? Yes. I promised you I'd help. Yes. Yeah I know. There seems to be nobody here. Good morning. Which fuel would you like? Listen, you! If my girlfriend hadn't come out there, you wouldn't even move your ass. I apologise. A hard day. Your head is hard, and not the day. Full tank now. Hi. Oh, hello. Congratulations. Are you coming tonight? Of course, I will. As always. Let me introduce you. This is Yulia. Ira. That's all. Get back to work. Look what you're making me do on my birthday. Sorry, I didn't know. Playful, bubbly woman. What do you mean? Didn't you see her? Wait here. One minute please. Good morning. You can come in. I'll meet you outside. Good morning. Good morning. You're the mother. Right? Right. And you the friend? Yes. Sit down, friend. This will take a while. So. We confirmed that the text message came from the East of Ukraine. Even more precisely, from the Donetsk region. But that doesnt mean much. What do you think, how could they get your number? Denis could have given it to them, I've had the same number for years. Have you done any public appearances lately? Talked to any strangers about Denis? Yes of course. She's been giving interviews left and right. What? The day before yesterday was an evening dedicated to the anniversary of his death. She must've been telling everyone that her son's still alive. I understand. His name does not appear in the lists of the prisoners or missing in action persons. You know, in this case, there is a chance that criminals found your interview, on the Internet for example, then found your contact information and are now blackmailing you with text messages. I got it. Thank you. Thank you. Wait. Where are you going now? I'm going to look for money. I think we need to wait a bit more. New information may be available soon. I've been waiting too long. Me too. Listen Yulia, I had a dream last night. As if I were running around the hospitals looking for Denis, and he is nowhere to be found. And suddenly I run into one hospital, and there in the middle of the courtyard, a kalina bush grows. Then I'm standing in Denis's ward. He is lying on the bed and is eating the kalina. I'm trying to tell him: "Do not eat this, son. It is bitter without sugar", but he doesn't listen to me. That's all. And I woke up. You hurried, Yulia. Denis will not forgive you when he gets back. How much have you managed to raise? Almost 20 000. I feel sorry for her. She's very affected by this. I did what I could. I know. People like her are the most vulnerable to this type of fraud. Can we do anything else? Anything else? You know what I mean. Right? And who is this man? My pal. How does he get information? He has his own methods. He used to help us get intel during the war. What's his name? Mr. Colonel. Have you tried looking in Rostov hospitals? They are checking, but you know how it is, it will take time. Where was the SMS sent from? Donetsk region, but the phone has been out of service the entire time. Wait here. How long? My friends are coming over tonight, we're having drinks for my birthday. I'd like you to be there. This is most likely fraud and there will be no new information. Does this mean Denis is dead? God knows. And what? This is it? Yulia, calm down. I can't help you anymore. Mr. Colonel is never wrong. You can't talk that way to people like him. I guarantee that nothing else can be done. OK. I'm sorry. Now let's go where I want to go. Wow. It's too vulgar for me. Perfect. If I may say so - you look gorgeous in this dress. Listen to this manbun. You will make him start stuttering. Look, let's buy the other dress. Forget it. It's more expensive. I insist. How do I look? I don't know. Ask the "manbun". We need to hurry, I have to go to work. Do you need a lift? For two, please. Military pass. Show me your privilege documents. It's obvious, these boys are soldiers. Every other guy now wears military uniform, should I let everyone on for free? Thanks. Hi. Hi. Vira Yosypivna, good evening. Hello, Yulia. I wanted to ask, has my paycheck arrived yet? Your coach picked it up already. When? This morning. Look! It's the independent girl. You're back already? We need to talk. You don't have anyone else to talk to? I'm serious. Stop eavesdropping guys. She no longer knows you. She has other priorities now, right Yulia? I'm really sorry, but I've trained enough girls already. Where is Oleg? I don't know, he disappeared somewhere. He's not as well off as you now. OK. Did Denis's mom come to you? Yes. She did. And? Nothing. Why the sudden growing interest? Cut it out. Did you give her anything? To blackmailers? You know I've always been generous, but giving them money is an idiotic act. Where is my paycheck? There it is. You are free to take it. Charitable contribution of the entire club as you remember. Didn't think we'd have a final meeting like this. Why are you so sluggish? Move more. You look like a junkie. Hi. Listen, I'm sorry I beat up your guy a little bit yesterday. Can I come in? Are you going somewhere? It doesn't matter. Oleg, you're injured. I'm injured only for sports. There's nothing else to say, I've re-enlisted. Why? Say whatever you came to say, I'm in a hurry - catching a train at 10. There was a text message saying that Denis is alive. Are you deaf? I said there is an SMS message saying that Denis is alive. From whom? From a doctor that supposedly will be operating on him. What do you think about it? Nothing. Oleg, is it possible at all? Yulia. Do you have any idea what war is? I do. You know fucking nothing. War, darling, is when you're an MMA champ, go there, hear gunshots a few kilometers away, and learn what fear is, for the first time in your life. It's when you're not afraid of charging into enemy territory, but you're afraid to be rejected when you come back home. It's when before storming the separatists, you don't think about whether you'll get killed or not, but you're trying to remember whether you've put little Darynka's drawing in a safe place near your heart. Understand? Did you know that your neighbour Petrovych returned a couple of days ago? I saw him. So here's the truth. He stayed on the battlefield and gave the group a chance to fall back, together with the sergeant, who then, in order to not be tried at a tribunal, said that the soldier had died. So they buried him like they did your Denis, while Petrovych was stuck in the enemy captivity for a year - for a year! Because he couldn't remember who and where he was. And when he started to remember, the war was over. Then they let him go. What else do you want to know about war? The war is over. Yulia! How can I stay here? Tell me. No girl, no job, I live in a fucking dumpster. I can't even buy clothes for myself because I have no idea what people wear now. I feel like everyone sees me as pathetic bum. I beep at the metal detector in nightclubs, because of shrapnel stuck inside me. But there. They understand. I'm just a good military guy. I wanted to score some cash today on underground fights but they didn't want to have me there, because of this fucking scar. How am I supposed to earn money? I don't have anybody here. You have us, you have the club. You have it. How dare you even say "you have us". When you were the first who betrayed my friend! How dare you? Get the hell out of here! Get the fuck out. Denis, congratulations on the victory! Thank you! What are your plans for the future? When will we see you in the ring again? I want to say something important now. With this fight, I'm suspending my career. I'm going to defend my country on the East of Ukraine. And when I return, we will meet again! Everything will be okay, mommy. Glory to... Hi. I'm here for Max. Max, you have a guest! Happy birthday! Oh! Such a cute animal. I appreciate it. Everybody, this is Yulia. We already met. And this. Let me. Borys Mykolaevych. But for you Yulia, just Borys. Natalia, Viktor, you've already met. I want to raise a toast to women, as they are the most important thing in a man's life. There are three of them: the one who gave life, the one who spoils life, and the one who gives the will to live every time you see her. Nice speech. To women. Hold on. Yulia, what do you do? I'm an ММА fighter. And what is that? Mixed martial arts. You're getting old. Now I get why you have a black eye. Yulia, please do not pay attention to them. It's starting. They're joking about me too. In my youthful age, working was much easier. Now imagine. In the morning, the husband tells his wife a sharp political joke. In the evening he is already in our cells. But now. Times have changed. And crimes have also evolved. Like people evolved from monkeys. Communications, internet, cybercrime, cyberpolice. You can be a criminal without leaving your bed. The main thing is to have the right information. I think it is sad and boring. So what about this joke, that a husband tells his wife in the morning? Why is your wife speaking that way? Can we step out? What's up? Relax. Everything's OK. Can you lend me 30 000 hryvnias? It's for Denis's mom. You promised me. Yes, I know. I just want to help her. I'll pay it back to you as soon as I can. Who is this Denis to you? What do you mean? Who is he to you? I told you already. A good friend of mine. I have a feeling that you lied. You're taking way too long in there! Get the drinks, we're coming! Who is he to you? It doesn't matter. Yes it does! Can you lend me this money? No. Let's go, people are waiting. Max. I want to drink to your health. Be healthy my old friend. Yulia, you're next. Сan I ask something? You can ask everything you want, any time. Yulia. Yulia, sit down. Can anybody lend me 30 000 hryvnias? Yulia. Can anybody of you lend me 30 000 hryvnias? I'll pay it back. Max, what is this all about? It's about a human life. It's about a text message from the East, saying someone needs money for a surgery. Not someone! Well, Yulia. You are an adult person and must understand that this is a fraud. You don't understand it is very important. Yulia, sit down! Maybe you want us all to chip in? Yes. if you can, I'll pay you all back. OK. Done. Keep calm, Yulia. I can check all the information tomorrow. I personally checked everything today. That's good. Let's drink now! So nobody cares? How dare you? Hi. Leave her alone, don't you see she doesn't want to talk to you. Don't you mind that idiot. Would you like to have some wine? We can have a nice evening together. May I get off? We did not want to offend you! Hey! Wait. We just want to get to know you. Hello. Well, hi! Hello. What are you doing? Bitch. It's me. What time is it? Almost eleven. Not long now. I wanted to ask... Want some coffee? How much did you raise? Twenty five. I'll get the rest. Without milk, please. "Travel agency" Who is it? Yulia. Who? Yulia Volenko. What a visitor at Shpric's place. Well, tell me. Do you want to order a honeymoon trip? The Carribean? Thailand? Egypt? I need 25 000 hryvnias. Everyone needs money these days. I need it now. I know that there are going to be "fights" tonight. You're knowledgeable. Are you gonna fight wearing this crap? It'll look ridiculous. Second-hand. But I can sell it to you for cheap. Well? Are you waiting for applause? Get out. Wanna warm up? If you win, you'll have what you want. What are the rules? No punching to the back of the head and no biting. Rounds? No rounds. Bets made! Let start the fight. Two in. One out! Pick me up. Hey. How did everything go? Look what I got for you. What about the message? I also got you a towel, toothpaste, shampoo, here you have fruits. SMS? Oh, you don't know? How can I know? Right. Well, everything went as I said it would. The accounts she sent the money to have been closed. Their phones are turned off. So everything's okay? It means we did it? It means that the criminals are already drinking expensive champagne, at your cost by the way. Yulia! Yulia! The entire hospital is talking about you - I didn't know you were that famous. Can I? A bit of time and there won't even be any scars. Yeah, sure. You know, yesterday they brought the last incarcerated guys from the east. One of them learned you were here and really wanted to see you. Which room is he in? 307. Wait please. You wanted to talk to her. This is Yulia Volenko. Give me my bag. I knew Denis. I gave him my word that I'd give this to you. Last time I saw him was more than a year ago, when he was leaving for the mission. We were in the same division. This is Denis's diary. I'm sorry. A lot of time has passed. Thank you. Yulia. I'm looking for you everywhere, and you are here at last. Well, tell me how you are cutie? At the resort. I brought you some tasty stuff. Left it in the ward. Tomatoes, cucumbers? Read this at home. What's that? I don't know. I did not read it.
