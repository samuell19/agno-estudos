(foreboding synth music) - Good afternoon! Gem Theater, home of the best movies in town. Perhaps I could be of some service to you? - [Caller] Could you tell me what you're playing today? - Well we are playing two beautiful love stories. One is called Since You Left the Country. I mean Since You Went Away Some Place and that's the one on the screen right now. - [Narrator] Now all the images of horror, the demons of your mind, crowd in on you to destroy you. (suspense music) (tense music) (movie people laughing maliciously) - Come on, let's sit down. (suspense music) - Whoa! (theatergoers laughing) (theatergoers murmuring) (suspense music) - Huh? (theatergoers screaming) - Dave! Dave, over there! - Don't go in, Jim. This won't do any good. It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen in my life. Come on, we gotta clear this area. - Aw shut up! (crowd screaming) (scattered coughing) (sci-fi synth music) - [Movie Actress] Let's go away together. - [Movie Actor] Yes, where? Where would you like to go? (tense music) - Well? - Special delivery. (projectionist screams) (phone ringing) (theatergoers yelling) - Come on, the movie! - Hey fix it, man! We can't see! - [Kremlock] Good. We can have a science fiction film. I keep feeding them stuff like this Plan Nine will be a cinch. Gem Theater today. Tomorrow Los Angeles. (crowd cheers and applauds) - You know who the stars say a man born under your sign should marry? - No. - Me. I'm a Scorpio and a Scorpio always gets along well with a Sagittarius. - Really? What else do they say? - Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight. - Oh brother. - I wish I may. I wish I might. Have the wish I wish tonight. (loud whistling) (suspense music) - Yeah! - Now we can take over. (ominous orchestra music) (projector whirring) (heavy breathing) (sci-fi suspense music) (man screams) - The master is ready to take over. Where is his control center? - Gotta wipe it off don't I? You'll be able to see everything from here, master. - Out of our way! Grab him! - I got it! I got it! Whoa! - Bah! (phone rings) - [Kremlock] Projection booth. - Charlie, what the hell is up? Are you crazy on the roof? Huh? Enough already! Enough! What? What? (tense music) - [Joanie] How do we get into the theater? - Hey, there's a way out. Well it's locked. (lasers zapping) (male lead screaming) - [Movie Alien] Remove your weapon, Commander and come here. - [Holloway] Why is it that I can hear you when the others can't? - [Movie Alien] Our individual brain frequencies are now attuned. So Commander Holloway, as you Earth inhabitants would express it, we meet face to face. - [Holloway] That's a face? - Point of view is everything. To us, your form of life is ugly. (suspense music) - [Holloway] Cody run! - What's the matter? Can't you see? (laughs) (tense music) - I've almost got it. - Brother-in-law or no brother-in-law! Open up in there! I said open up the door! (lasers zapping) (music intensifies) - I feel like a new man. (doorknob drops) - What do you see, Billy? - [Billy] I can't tell. Uh-oh, hide. (tense music) (sultry music) - [Kremlock] What a gorgeous dame! (Alien screams and groans) What's the matter? You don't like the movie? (suspense music) (bone cracking) - Ow! - Your break is over. I don't pay you for lying on the floor. (lasers zapping) - (whispers) There's Mike and Tim. (alien spacecraft whirring) - [Male Lead] (whispers) An electronic eye. Like a television camera. It's looking for us. - Hey out of the way! - Move! - Hey. - What are you guys doing? - The usher's after us. - [Mike] It's only a couple bucks to get in. - It's not the money, it's the fun of it, dork. Something really weird happened upstairs. - [Usher] Can't you two sit still? - They could be as curious about us as we are about them. - [Female Lead] We better get out of here. - We better get out of here. Talk to you later. (fart noise) - [Angry Theatergoer] Shut up, fatso! - [Annoyed Theatergoer] Not again. - [Female Lead] Something moved out there! (suspense music) They've blocked it. - [Male Lead] It's blocked here too. (action orchestra music) (alien shrieks) (tense music) - [Joanie] Oh shit. (alien snarling) (Usher screams) (suspense music) (woman screams) - Hit the antenna! Hit the antenna! (alien insect chirping) Get the other antenna! Get the other antenna! He's helpless without them! (insect roaring) - The deltoid atomizer and thought materializer are being moved into position. And we've already secured several humans specimens. These humans suspect nothing. They can hardly discern reality from illusion. The result of too many hours spent in the dark riveted to these moving mind-rotting images. Their brains are effectively on hold. Emitting low level theta waves. This audience is ripe for takeover as long as Kremlock keeps the moving images flowing we've commenced the countdown to Plan Nine. It will happen at midnight. (suspense music) - Who are you? What do you want? - [Gor] I am Gor. I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here on your Earth. - Why me? - [Gor] Because you are a recognized nuclear scientist. Because you have untraceable places on Earth I want to go. I chose your body very carefully. Even before I knew about Sally. A very exciting female. - Leave Sally out of this. - Why? She appeals to me. There are some aspects of the life of an Earth savage that are exciting and rewarding. Things that are missed by the brains on my planet Eros. - You so much as touch Sally I'll... - [Gor] It is you who are touching her. Even I must have some interest to spur me on. She'll do very nicely. - I warned you! (plate shatters) (alien master babbling) - Ugliest thing I ever saw. If the humans will swallow this, Earth is in the bag, master. (alien master babbling) - What are you gonna do with these humans when they're in your control anyway? (alien master babbling) - Well don't forget. You promised me a promotion. One of their women too. (alien master babbling) (homeless man humming) - Huh? (suspense music) (speaking alien language) - Whoa, pardon me. - Beep beep! (laughs) (slurred muttering) - Hi! (suspense music) - My name is Emile Franchel. And I am a psychologist specializing in hypnotism. You are about to see a preview of the most fantastic advance ever to be made in the history of motion picture entertainment called Hypno-Vista. It is a psychological technique whereby you, seated in the auditorium, actually become part of the action you see on the screen. Let me show you something. You'll feel absolutely no pain at all. How do you feel? - Fine, thank you. - Well thank you, young lady. We'll get back to removing the needles in just a few moments. This is the power of suggestion. So I suggest that you see this motion picture. See and actually feel. (rude theatergoers laugh) - See you later, worm! - [Narrator] No human eyes have ever seen anything like this before. (woman screams) - Jack! Jack! (suspense music) - They're like huge seed pods. - This must be the way that putty in my closet was formed. Miles, where did they come from? - I don't know. If they are seeds or seed pods they must grow some place on a plant probably. And somebody or something wants this duplication to take place. - But when they're finished what happens to our bodies? - I don't know. When the process is completed probably the original is destroyed or disintegrates. No wait! - Sorry, But I take a dim view of watching my own destruction take place. - There isn't any danger until they're completely formed. We learned that last night at your house. Your plant didn't change right away. - Not until you fell asleep. Miles, when the change does take place, do you suppose there's any difference? - [Miles] There must be. Wilma noticed it. So did little Jimmy. - [Becky] So did I. My father. - [Miles] That must be what he was doing in the cellar last night placing one of these. - They have to be destroyed. All of them! - [Miles] They will be. Every one of them. Listen to me, we're gonna have to search every building. Every house in town. Men, women and children are gonna have to be examined. We've got some phoning to do. - [Jack] I'm gonna stay right here where I can watch them. - [Wilma] I'm gonna stay away from them. - [Miles] And don't call the police! Nick Grivett didn't find any body on a burning haystack. (tense music) - (whispers) Careful. Come on, that curtain leads behind the screen. - [Joanie] What do you see? - Ow! - [Joanie] Careful. It's the cashier. And the usher. - [Billy] And the manager. - I saw a movie once on TV. They had seed pods just like these. And they take over your body and turn you into a Republican or something. At least that's what my dad said. - What about them? - I don't know. Look, we better get some help fast. (tense music) - [Kremlock] Keep moving. Keep moving. - [Proton] Cut the talk! Let's get these pods into the theater pronto. Andale! Capiche? - [Billy] (whispers) I've heard of illegal aliens, but this is ridiculous. - Great idea, Houdini. Now what are we gonna do? (suspense music) - [Driver] Are you crazy, you big idiot? - Look! You fools, you're in danger! Can't you see? They're after you! They're after all of us! Our wives, our children, everyone! They're here already! You're next! You're next! You're next! You're next! You're next! (suspense music) - Ew! - It will please you, master, to know that business is brisk at the box office. (alien master babbling) - Thank you, madam. Thank you, madam. Immediate seating, ladies. Plenty of seats on the inside. (man snoring) - [Miles] You're next! You're next! You're next! You're next! - [Art] What was that? - [Johnny] Art, did you see it? - [Art] I saw something. - Use the gun. - Did I hit it? - Can't see anything. - Certainly sounds like you did. Johnny, use the spotlight. Turn the spotlights on. (alien squeaking) It's the light that hurts! It's in there, it's got to be. - [Johnny] Don't get excited. (woman screams) - Here they come again! - [Johnny] Look at that. I never would've believed it. - [Art] What do we do now? - [Johnny] Looks like we've had it. - Gonna make a run for it. (Johnny groans) - Want some? Just kidding. (alien squeaking) (Johnny groaning) (woman screams) - [Female Lead] Here they come again! Where did they come from? (man snoring) - Huh? ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ To get ourselves a treat ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ To get ourselves a treat ♪ Delicious things to eat ♪ The popcorn can't be beat ♪ The sparkling drinks are just dandy ♪ ♪ The chocolate bars and the candy ♪ ♪ So Let's all go to the lobby ♪ To get ourselves a treat (homeless man muttering) (screams) (gasps) - Really, I feel the same way about the picture.

I want my hamburger! - Shh, be quiet. - [Little Brat] I don't want that! I want my hamburger! Why can't I have my hamburger? I asked for my hamburger! - [Mother] Stop. - [Little Brat] Mommy I want my hamburger! (jazzy orchestra music) (family members arguing) (theatergoers shushing) (man screams) (woman screams) - I asked for my hamburger now! - Shh! - Mommy! I want my hamburger! - [Theatergoer] We're trying to watch a movie! (theatergoers arguing) - I want my hamburger! (theatergoers cheer and applaud) - Who shot this stuff? - [Mylar] With your approval, master, engineering officers Dextrous and Proton will set up the interociter, adjust the atomizer, and fine tune the materializer. - I can't cut this. (alien master babbling) - Just a short while longer and we'll be ready for- - I need a close up. There's no coverage. (alien master babbling) - I can't just throw this stuff together. We've got a sophisticated audience. You want good word of mouth don't you? (alien master babbling) - And how about legs? (alien master babbling) - I didn't mean anything by it. All right, I'll cut it any crummy way you want. As I was saying, master, at your command we will commence a test run. - It's not my picture anyway. (grand orchestra music) - [Narrator] Monster of monsters! Big as a skyscraper! (Rodan roaring) When he moves the whole Earth quivers and quakes and an abyss of horror opens up. See these prehistoric beasts emerge from the bowels of the Earth after 200 million years to devastate mankind. (siren blaring) Supersonic jets cannot catch it. - Hey! - Hey! (girls giggling) - [Narrator] Armored tanks are helpless before him. - Hey, come here. - [Narrator] Even guided missiles are powerless. See Rodan destroy a modern city. Leveling it to the Earth with a killing air stream of his mighty wing. Nothing can stop him! (loud explosions) (Rodan roars) Nothing escapes this monstrous beast of evil. (Rodan roars) - Hey man, I'm pushing pods. Yeah, I'm up to my ass in pods. - We'll use them in the morning. Then it's on to Los Angeles. - Yeah, yeah. And don't forget Vegas. Yeah, Vegas! - I've stationed First Lieutenant Muffo at our central security post. He's one of your most vigilant soldiers. Devoted to our cause and completely selfless. These humans are no match for our superior intellect. And in time, despite our differences, we will win over their women as well. ♪ I'm in the mood for love ♪ Simply because you're near me ♪ - So that's what you look like. You're ugly! Horrible! Go on. Try your intellect on me! (alien master babbling) - You think you're gonna make a slave of the world. I'll see you in Hell first! - Claire! (Claire screams) (suspense music) Fire and fall back! - Go get 'em, tiger! - Fall back! - How well you doing? - Half my men are dead. Nothing can stop that thing. - Call off your troops. - Are you nuts? - I said call them off! - Cease firing! - I made it possible for you to come here. I made you welcomed to this Earth. You made it a charnel house! (suspense music) - What do you mean you're out of everything? Now listen, Bozo. You see this? Say hello to Mr. Fist. Mr. Fist says he's real hungry and wants some popcorn. Ain't that right, Mr. Fist? You get my meaning? (playful piano music) (sci-fi synth) - Thanks, man. Look, sorry about the hassle. Sure is heavy for a bunch of... Whoa! - [Proton] Are you sure that's the right connection? - [Dextrose] Look, I've done this before. I've connected the human brains to the interociter. The interociter to the brain booster. Brain booster to the thought materializer. And the thought materializer to the power. It's simple. Okay, now for a little test. (electricity buzzing) Whoops. - I smell something awful. What's cooking? Maybe it's bacon. (ominous movie music) - [Narrator] They came from beyond space. To enslave the Earth. - Look out! - [Narrator] From the mysterious reaches of infinity, a gigantic astral body hurdles towards the Earth. To terrorize and seal the doom of an unprepared mankind. (woman screams) As if by design, this death-dealing meteor plunges into the depths of the sea. - [Narrator] Does it come from another country or another world? This terrifying menace that G2 must destroy before it's too late. - Get the Pentagon. Class A emergency. - [Narrator] Flying saucers have invaded our planet. Washington, London, Paris, Moscow are key targets. The whole world is under attack. Can it survive? - [Narrator] Top scientists and brass from the armed forces confer on the emergency. - We have come here to this planet for one purpose only. To acquire breeding stock to repopulate our planet. - [Narrator] Love-hungry spacemen come to seize our women that their dying race may live. (woman screams) See the kidnapping of the Earth maidens for the love-starved slaves of the sterile planet! - Very good. We have done well, Nadir. - I am pleased, princess, you are satisfied. - I will be satisfied when we have enough more like her to commence phase three. - We can't let these creatures breed on Earth. - Allen, that's not for us to decide. (suspense music) - See? I told you. - Let me try this. (electricity buzzing) - Now you got that line crossed with that one. - Maybe they're burning garbage. - There's been a slight delay in the engineering phase. (suspense music) - [Narrator] Within three days. The dead will destroy all the living. (music intensifies) - [Alien Speaker] People of Earth, attention. People of Earth, attention. This is a voice speaking to you from thousands of miles beyond your planet. We are the survivors of a disintegrated solar system. At this moment the remainder of our fleet is circling your globe. - They set up an electronic screen. The artillery doesn't penetrate. (suspense music) (brat gasps) (woman screams) - Oh no, not Disneyland! - You almost got a cheap haircut. (woman screams) - Mommy, what are all these weenies doing in my popcorn? - Shh. - [Theatergoer] Yo Rambo, shut up your little porker! - Keep firing at saucers. - Mommy! No, that's not fair! - [Theatergoer] Shut up! - [Little Brat] Turn it down! Now! Mommy it's not fair! You paid money! (theatergoers applaud) - [Emergency Broadcaster] The present danger has ended. The present danger has ended. The present danger has ended. (theatergoers cheering) - [Narrator] Date, the 18th of the month. Sky clear. Light clouds. Visibility unlimited. Time, 0:18:15 hours. A CAB plane flies toward the scene of the previous day's crash involving Mitchell McAfee. On board, four members of the Civil Aeronautics Board investigating team. And a pilot. Time, 0:08:16 hours. Another significant moment in history. (giant bird roaring) Once more a frantic pilot radios in a report on A UFO. A bird. A bird as big as a battleship. Circling and preparing to attack the CAB plane. (suspense music) - The human mind can only take so much abuse, master. What do you say we take them over now huh? - We mustn't be impatient, master. Their brain waves must be completely neutralized before we activate the thought materializer. Their primitive emotions and unbridled lusts must be rendered dormant. We don't want to create any monsters we can't handle now do we? (alien master babbling) - [Kremlock] All right. If we're gonna make them sit through two more shows their brains are gonna leak all over the floor. (whimsical melody) - [Narrator] The thing that went wrong in the secret atomic laboratory. (woman screams) - [Narrator] The new atomic miracle should have been mankind's greatest boon. Instead, when such power to cause phenomenal growth proved dangerously unstable, man was confronted with his most shocking blunder. - The isotope triggered our nutrient into a nightmare. - [Narrator] A blunder that transformed a tiny insect into the hundred foot spider that was now ravaging the panic-stricken countryside. (dance music) (woman screams) (dancers screaming) - What's gotten into you kids? - Beat it! It's alive! (spider roaring) - (chuckles) Spiders. I tell them to bring me one and I'd believe it. (suspense music) - The Air Force is standing by with an atom bomb. - You can't drop an atom bomb on Chicago. - [Narrator] A man who, in a flash, became a living threat to humanity. A danger so awe-inspiring that they tried to hide his existence. - What happened? What made him grow? - Glen Manning is growing from eight to 10 feet a day. At the moment he's 18 feet tall. Tomorrow he'll be 26 feet. The next day 35, maybe 40, and the next day- - But you've got to stop it! (suspense music) - I don't want to grow anymore! - Drive it in hard. We have to penetrate the bone in the first injection. - Ready? (giant man groans) - [Female Lead] Look out, he's reaching down! - We want to help you to get well! (man screams) - Manning's disappeared, Eric. We can't find him anywhere on the grounds. - Police Chief Benton has asked me to tell you to stay in your homes. Stay in your homes. - The marine monster's at large in this vicinity. Perhaps even inside the Bay Area. The federal authorities are doing everything possible to locate it. And together with the city government are taking every step proper and possible to end this danger. (suspense music) - The Air Force is standing by with an atom bomb. - [Narrator] The H bomb blasted it loose from the depths of the Pacific. But not even the H bomb can kill it. - Fire! - [Narrator] So massive, so overwhelming, that thousands upon thousands are propelled into senseless terror. Panic takes the place of planned evacuation. And whole cities are paralyzed by fear. (sirens wailing) - [Proton] Pods for San Francisco, truck number three. Pods for Lompoc, truck number four. Evening, Sheriff. How many? - Let me have four more. And that'll take care of the so-called law and order in this town. - [Proton] You heard him. Four more pods. Hey Sheriff, how are the wife and kids? - [Sheriff] Sound asleep. Like peas in a pod. - [Mylar] Thanks. Moving four more for the department. Proton, check out back. Then round everybody up. 11 o'clock is the deadline. - [Proton] Yes sir. - [Mylar] The rest of you keep moving. We don't have all night. - Trapped. And it's 10 already. - We've gotta tell Mike and Tim somehow. They're the only ones we can trust. - Yeah, but how? We're surrounded. (monster roaring) (suspense music) - [Narrator] Its core a mass of lethal radiation. Rising from the depth of time. Its strength enormous. Its gargantuan ferocity a threat to London. To the world itself. - Have you any concrete suggestions? - Yes. First block off the Thames. (monster roaring) - It's here, General, here! (monster roaring) (woman screaming) - [Intercom] Reptilicus approaching the city! Repeat! Reptilicus approaching the city! - This is Grayson. All units. Fire at will! (monster roaring) (crowd screaming) (suspense music) (woman screams) - Fantastic. There's a huge monster gorilla that's constantly growing to outlandish proportions loose in the streets. - Let me go! Please let me go! (man screams) (theatergoer gasps) (woman screams) - I said let me down! Help! Help! (crowd screaming) (driver screaming) - All phases of Plan Nine are in perfect confluence, master. - Confluence? There ain't no such word. - The humans are on the edge of annihilation. And little do they suspect. - Pompous ass. - Extraneous anus. - Why you... Fire maiden from outer space. (alien master babbling) - Well he started it. - [Narrator] It had started casually, insignificantly as momentous events often do. - Look there. Two points off the port bow. - I believe it's actually lifting itself out of the water, Pete. What do we do about that? (suspense music) (crowd screaming) - You think you'll be able to drive it out to sea? - I hope so. - [Narrator] Every device of military science, every defensive weapon, radar, planes, rockets, marshal to destroy a thousand tons of beastly fury. A monster leaving a trail of carnage. Spreading panic across a continent. (woman screams) - Hit the alert button! - Yes sir. (alarm blaring) (monster roaring) (woman screams) - [Narrator] What happens to our world if massive monstrous man-beasts like this invade us? - The colossal man is loose in Los Angeles. (siren wailing) - Look! Look at the giant! (giant groaning) - Come on, man. Let's have some fun. (boombox rock music) Yeah, that's it! Yeah! Yeah! - [Theatergoer] Hey come on! ♪ I don't wanna live ♪ I wanna die ♪ I wanna die ♪ I wanna die (theatergoers cheer and applaud) - If it pleases you, master, the thought materializer and the deltoid atomizer are ready for testing. (alien master babbling) - What'd he say? - Start it, dummy. - [Operator] May I help you? - Hello, operator, you've gotta help us. This is an emergency. (tense music) They've got eyes that stick out. Machines. And a spaceship. (alien master babbling) - They're taking over the world and we're trapped up here. - Please hurry! You've gotta come! You've gotta help us right now! (phone disconnects) (electricity buzzing) (alien master babbling) (screams) (dramatic music) (monster roaring) - We'll try to pick up some of the action and excitement through our window. We can't see him. But from the helicopter on the street he must be... Wait a minute. There he is! A 60 foot giant in the streets of Las Vegas! Look at the size of that man. (crowd screaming) - We're entering Las Vegas, Colonel. - [Pilot] Oh no, look out! (screams) (suspense music) - [General] Glenn! Glenn! Glenn, listen to me! You must put the girl down! Put the girl down! You're holding Carol in your hand! - Don't do it, Glenn. - [General] Do you understand, Glenn? The girl is Carol! - I'm Carol, Glenn. Please put me down! - Go ahead, Glenn. Squeeze her. She's gonna love it. - [General] Put her down! Put the girl down! - Oh Glen, no. No no. No don't. Don't, Glenn. - Fire! (Glenn screams) - Aww. What do you expect from a guy in a diaper? (alien master babbling) (monster bird cawing) - Steady. Steady. Fire rockets! (bird cawing) (generals laugh) - (whispers) Come on, come on. - I don't get it. - Yeah, neither do we. All we know is these aliens are using people to do something terrible at midnight. Now they're after us. - We've gotta do something. - What about the sheriff? - They're in it too. We've gotta get out and find help. But we'll need some kind of proof. - Well. Tim and I noticed some foreigners down there with cameras. - Okay. Joanie and I can't go in the theater 'cause they recognize us. But you guys could. Here's my plan. You go down left... - Anybody around here want some coffee? - No, but you can come in. (tense music) - [Scientist] .3. .4. - [Kenneth] Before we start cooking. - [Scientist] .5. .6. - Watch it, everybody! That thing's out of the greenhouse. Be sure and stay together. - .9. Captain, what about throwing kerosene on it and setting it on fire? - We can try. Get that- - Here's a boat can. - I'll take it, sir. We'll need something to put it in. - [Captain] You two be ready in case it needs more. - [Crewmate] I think you're right, Captain. - [Scientist] 1.3 now. - [Captain] You know how to shoot that thing don't you? - [Shooter] I saw Gary Cooper in the target yard. - 1.4. - Come here. Get in the corner. Now hold this in front of you. Stay by the light switch. - 1.5, 1.6. (window breaking) - What was that? - Sounds like a window. 1.8. - Cop those lights. - 1.9. The needle's at the top. (monster roaring) - Shit. - Ghastly, it's horrible! - You can say that again. - [Scientist] Ghastly, it's horrible! - The last reel is ready, master. We will change the course of human history forever. (alien master babbling) - Ready when you are, master. - You did it. Great. If we can just get a photo maybe then they'll believe us. - Oh yeah, you guys, I checked it out. You might be able to get out the back way now. You better go. - Good luck, you guys. (alien master babbling) - [Proton] Ready, master. - Just say the word, master. (alien master babbling) (creatures roaring) - Wow! (mysterious music) - Come on. (alien wavelengths emitting) (woman screams) (alien master babbling) - A transmission from home, master. - Hey you! (alien master gulps) (babbled "uh-oh") - Yes you! I've found you at last. Your mother is worried sick. The space mobile is missing, her purse is gone, and somebody ran over the cat and left it in the driveway. You've always been a willful child, but world conquest without my consent is out of the question. Put down those humans and return home immediately. We will discuss the matter. Father to son. - Yes, father. - Well I guess we'll have to call off the invasion. (alien master babbling) - You heard what he said. (alien master babbling) - No kidding? (alien master babbling) - Then I can still get me a woman. ♪ I'm still in the mood for love ♪ - I suggest you have a stern talk with Kremlock, master.

(man screams) (Joanie muffled screams) - No! - Hey, now wait a minute, guys. You don't want to do that. - You will become just like one of us. - What is that? - Ugh! - Come on.
