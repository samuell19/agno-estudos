Kissing you. Well, I can see that. Don't play with me Marc. I'm not. Yeah, I do. I really do. My parents are just gonna try to keep me out here forever and you know sooner or later it's gonna get really bad again. Well, I'm gonna end up leaving in the middle of some ugly fight, so just why not leave before the shit hits the fan? I have another call, can you just hold? Thanks. Hello? Mm-hmm. Yes? This is she. She what? You're kidding me! Really? Oh, my God. Um, yeah, sure, anytime. Tomorrow at 2:00 is perfect. Fine...thanks! Oh, my God! [phone ringing] Hello? Doctor, I'm really, really sorry, but you're never gonna believe what happened. Tina Brown's secretary just called me and she wants to meet me tomorrow at 2:00! Yeah. Mm-hmm...okay. ♪ Marc, Robert, come quick! Tina called me, she actually called me! You mean you're not going to jail? I spoke to her secretary, who's lovely by the way! And she said that Tina said, that my persistence was legendary! She wants to meet me! Tomorrow! That's fantastic. The FBI must have put in a good word. Oh, my God I'm so excited. I could just... I don't know what I could do. They took away all my credit cards. Are you two holding hands? Does this mean what I'd like to think it means? Maybe. We're not sure. Are you sure we're not sure? You were the one who was sure we're not sure. We're not sure. Robert, don't let him pull that danger boy routine on you. I'm not pulling anything. Don't fuck with him, Marc, you hear me? He's not. Yeah right. I'm not. You okay? I'm fine. Really, it's fine! It's fine? Doesn't exactly sound very romantic to me. Cynthia, he's fine, I'm fine. Looks like you're fine, how about some lunch, huh? You two should be together, you're perfect for each other. You didn't do it did you? In your mother's garden? We have better manners than that. Yeah, but you're going to, right? I mean, please tell me that you're going to. I find this talk shocking don't you? Extremely. Oh, you crazy boys. Men. Thank you. All right. Let's get going because I really want to make a quick getaway before Mom and Dad get home. Good idea. ♪ What a day this has been. What a rare mood I'm in. Robert, please, I can only handle so much glee. She hasn't been out of hospital that long. Did you know that nervous breakdowns are highly underrated? You don't say?
