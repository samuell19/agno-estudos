A very good afternoon, ladies present. Welcome again to the 18th annual summer race in Dikkedam. And I see that the children are all ready to stand. They have trained hard and it is a sporting contest... under the municipal motto: a healthy mind in a body AROUND. I want to use this moment to thank the sponsors. Like a warm applause for Fred Banquet. Finally one word of thanks to the trumpet family... as always strengthens the inner man with their hot dog stand. And now, folks: the contest. Berrie Kooymans. Samira Vrijburg. Jan Vos. Junior Pastry. Saar Black. And the winner and champion of last year: Dik Trom. I would say: Put him on. The first candidate today is Berrie Kooymans. On a diet of ravioli, omelettes and chocolate bars... he achieved spectacular weight of 62 kilos. Last year he finished 8th and this year he has chance of gold. Oops oops oops. A displacement of 20 cubic meters, which is not so bad. I see Samira Vrijburg warm up and I'm very curious about her attempt. There she is. Strained calf. Looks like it is a simple hurricane. But it can also be a torpedo. But it is HARD. Is not this wonderful. Fantastic. We have now arrived at the last candidate today. The winner of last year: Dik Trom. Still A bite of his hot dog for the finishing touch. But how he will surprise us this year. This MUST be a world record. This is incredible. The entire pool is empty, by Dik Trom. What a sport. - Tatatataaa. - Chocolate cake. Wow. Hey, wait a minute. You will get back. You will get back. - Do not do it, that's sin. No do not do that. Good day, Mr. Bergstrom. Sorry, sir Dikdoener. I did not expect you here. No, I notice. We come by to try your cooking skills. But of course. Help yourself, take as much as you want. Look. Who are they? -The Dikdoeners. They manage 15 top restaurants throughout the country. And gentlemen, is it? - We have not really convinced. All our restaurants are guided by the best chefs. My dad is the best cook of all. Do you have apple crumble ever tasted? Or chicken legs. Who will you still tasty too? Drum, it's like this. Running a restaurant is quite different than a hot dog stand. Look. What's wrong with it now? Nothing at all. That's a beautiful building. It is located in the city 's busy street. An ideal place for a nice restaurant. What do you think? If it is such an ideal place, why should it close? Because the food is apparently not good enough. I do not know. Honey, this is OUR chance. OWN a restaurant. That's what you always wanted? Our dream. Gentlemen, we do it. Well done, Mr. Bergstrom. Congratulations. Thank you. -But Remember, Trom: We'll give you a month. Otherwise we sell that place yet. Do not you worry. I make sure that in no time the matter is booming. We see eachother. What are those people thin. Are those people where they collect money for on TV? I think so. This is the ideal place for a nice restaurant. Dad, what is that a diet? No idea, but eating to me at all. Oh, say beautiful. Even better than I thought. Ooooo, what beautiful. Like New. Oh, look. Ooooo. Real crystal. Oh, it's beautiful. Look here. This. And kitchen. O. 10 pits. Haha, that's my dream. And a double deep-frying, it may not be on. And an oven.

Wait, hold on. Ho ho ho. Need help? -Hey? Well, thank you. No problem. Normally I lift double. Pats. Pats. Pats. Dolf. -Trom, Pleasant. Hey. Fat. You could say, yes. The rest but also to do?

And then I go over there to sell my famous hot dogs. The entire park will be full... and when they have tasted of the hot dogs, then they want more. I can assure you. They may need one little push, but that's okay. Well, okay then. BUT we come back after the summer competition. And when you've made a profit, then we close the tent. You might do charity. We certainly do not. Exactly. Hi, Mr. Bergstrom. -day, Boy. Fat is not there? No, boy. That does not count today. That's home. Oh really? That's a shame eh, Thick-Sjak? Then you become final again, eh. Good afternoon. Welcome to the annual summer contest Dunhoven. We have a very lean program this year. With a pentathlon for the boys and a beauty contest... What are you going to do? I'm going to see. Dolf invited me into his skybox. do not you help me? -There Is no one. And I'm still just anyone unhappy. But first of all we would like to thank our sponsors. I have a big round of applause for Sonja Butcher? From: Fly Swift lean with diet Sonja Butcher. " Also like one warm welcome to Dr. Schoening Meister... the same liposuction clinic. And a token of thanks... our highly acclaimed Dolf Dolf's Gym. Yes. Ho Pardon. Hey, Mrs. Bergstrom. You again looks phenomenal out. Oh, this old thing. - Sit down. I have a delicious protein shake for you. And it is now time for the match. Please pay attention to the first part. Boxing for boys. And then we are off here Dunhoven... where we start boxing at the boys. There Sjak opted against Viktor. The bell has sounded. The match has started. This is incredible, within 8 seconds. Viktor has thus won the first part of the summer competition. ONE of the fastest victories ever. Ladies and gentlemen: Big applause. Hey. Is your father there? Which is the summer game. Can you help me differently here? So, if you'd just sign here. Henk BUTCHER? -Yes. you called Henk Slager? Yeah, why do you want to know? Are you related to Sonja Butcher? That was me. Earlier. Are you the father of Lady? That was Sharon Stoffels. A creditable ninth of the jury. She sees beeldig out. She has a body mass index of 15.1. Now to Dear Butcher. Indeed family and that's good to see. Gorgeous figure. Really not an ounce too much. And she has, yes unbelievable... a Body Mass Index of 14.6. Beautiful. And look at: 10. Yes. I am the father of Lady. But I have not seen her for a long time. Her mother and I divorced when she was very young. But you yourself are awfully thick. - So what? Dear said that you left because your hair was too thick. What? they say that? - Is not that it? I let my daughter do not abandon because she's fat. Why did you leave? I pulled it out in this town. DUNhoven. All that whining about calories and health. I'm going crazy from there. And then dear? Sonja I begged to go along. She did not. Terrified that she would arrive a little. As I said, it did not matter. I've waited a long time, but I did not full. I really have run off. So if you just want to put a little drawing. Yes, a 10. -I'm hungry. Yet even by biting, just three rounds. Delicious hot dogs. Nice extra sauerkraut, extra onions. Extra tasty. Extra tasty. Have you never regretted it? Of course. I miss her every day. She misses you. -Really? She looks at me? Yeah. ALSO She loves good food. Want to see her? -Do You have a picture then? No, but she participates in the summer competition. That does not seem like such a good idea. -Of course it is. That's perfect. Because if they see YOU... they know that it's okay if you're fat. Is it too thick, then? -No me. I'm fat. Yes, but I think... I think it's not a good idea.... Hurry up. Otherwise we are too late. And Viktor wins again and is thus well on the way to that coveted first place. Like every year the weather is sponsored by his father... So this victory is a bit Viktor AND Dolf. Left, left, left. Skip to the next section of the guys, and that's BMX. And this is also the finals of the boys. And I'm very curious if anyone can beat Viktor. They have left. Immediately an exciting fight. There it is. The last corner. From here it is not to see who takes the lead. Who goes first across the finish line? It is unbelievable. It WEATHER Viktor. A resounding victory, again for Viktor. And with that Viktor FINALLY won the summer contest. That's sport. Nice is that, huh? go over your limits. The opponent humiliate, destroy. What are you waiting for? What if she does not want to see me at all? -Of Course she wants it. Do you think? Get in there. And then we go to perhaps the most important part of the day. The talent round at the girls. Do you see her? Maybe she's already gone. Let us also go, we have no business here. I suggest you here for. Dear. Fat, you're come. -Yes. And I've brought someone for you. This is Henk. Hi.

Dear, I er... -You Just lied to me. I uh... - All those diets, sapkuren, vibrators... I just wanted what was best for you. Nonsense. You just do it for yourself. Oh, dear... Hey Dik. You are here. Heee. -Where is mommy? Mom's pins soy food with Dolf. -Getver. What? Those pins or soy Dolf? - Both. But how's it going? It does not, boy. I can just pack up as well. Join me then but six. - Huh, really? Are you eating again? Ladies and gentlemen. It is now the turn of our last candidate: Dear Butcher. It will show a piece of dance from the famous ballet by Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake. I can paint, I can design the... Dear Butcher, with Swan Lake. We must see each other often...
