suppose that you have a boyfriend waiting or or a party that you'd better go to nothing urgent glad you decided to stay I'm also curious what about the flattery the tender smiles I was it just a required protocol for executive role or are you really interested I find you a very interesting man you know we can talk scrape with each other ginger can't we come on we're both on the same team sure that's why I know I can ask a little favor in there you do it for me sure if I could now look this may sound crazy but you were the only one in this whole company that I can ask I am yeah you're in charge of the personnel records Roger I think that the confidential phone wireless what did you make sure where he doesn't look at those files just one quick look little files are locked sure I'm not supposed to let anybody look at them my job ginger I think you won't sit down the state I need that motion Charlie Charlie Charlie we have a major crime progress on the 1200 lift hours building give me a third law assignment three additional truck companies and all available air bottles I didn't want you have rescue problem negative we had one fatality one man injured the injured man has been identified as a security guard he said there's nobody else in the building tell us the problems his men are having with this fire chief maca can you tell us please what's going on kula for one thing the fire started 126 feet above ground level and we don't have aerial equipment I enough to reach that far so everything we're fighting this fire with has to be carried up on our backs I see there's a surprising lack of flames visible from the outside why is that well that's because a tall building like this is like a giant incinerator the heat and smoke and flames go straight up nobody literally becomes a chimney and any inside opening like an elevator shaft or a stairwell or air-conditioning ducts just sucks the smoke they hate the flames straight up and pushes of outward we can't get above it so we have to fight it from below so to chase it from Florida floor where the fire has already climbed seventh floor so far now is there a possibility would go all the way to the top yeah there's always that possibility but we're certainly going to do everything we can to keep that from happening well what steps here would you be excuse me more vino anyone no no I'm gonna just stay with it just happened have another bottle all night yeah I would say I had the last Epistle I read anywhere I said that there about 50 100 some odd percent women really like him don't you fantastic he's rotten it's fantastic yeah he makes a pretty good presentation I mean you and him nope well almost but that was another office party anyway don't let her worry I mean Kelly's really not my type besides that was almost two years ago your Overland catches her he's busy she would know we're gone come on ginge was just down the hole please refill yeah help yourself we got our own bottle our here we go you're crazy about lamb chops well done medium and you buy your clothes at Boardman suppressives you've done quite a bit of research little not exactly hot office gossip but interesting what about the negative side you mean like a wife I do have one every successful executive shoot boys we have a lot of trouble hole in this thing the fires extended at the utility shaft in the 17th floor to get those hoses up in a hurry Italian seventh Italian one I'm sending three additional companies the air conditioning is shoving heat the smoke into the upper floors I'm gonna shut off the power we need those elevators chief the guys will drag it from blowing stuff up a stairwell I don't those flames carry any higher right then let me cut the power on the fire that'll shut off the air conditioners and we'll still have part of the rest of the building all right try but those flames company higher up the power to everything come on thank you well I find that I can work better with this probably going to call some gorgeous number yes it's nicely bound I collected it might be too obvious where my damn course is so expensive are they you're worried about our boss over there I think he's pretty well occupied yes expensive have you ever seen the boardroom no we have some very rare volumes in there must be where all the big decisions are made I didn't wanted to do that for a long time I'm going to be like relax she liked me should I apologize all these important movie gentlemen ask members of the Board of Directors I don't see you picture I'm not dead yet it won't be that easy that's a sure I even wanted it to be we gotta look why don't you kids give us a break and you play game by yourself okay hey went to go ride your bike okay don't have a ring oh I think I'm getting too old for this I probably are over the hill as a matter of fact you definitely order to help visit my friend in case you're interested ladies over 35 are over there I know how you enjoy your Sundays with a kid that means pushing in baby are you kidding these kids are crazy about you I know I just thought that it would be easier to talk relax come here I am I had it all figured out the way I was going to tell you I had one all figured out your mind pregnant what you can call me stupid or dumb or whatever it's just a tire stay on the pill when I should have are you sure you're pregnant sure that's great that is just great what do we do now discuss it I mean I can think of a couple a couple of possibilities right off like what well um abortion isn't a lot easier now we could just get married he didn't have the baby about Kat damn Paul what about them they're part of you aren't they I mean well it is kind of a package deal sure I just tell him their daddy made a slight bedroom mistake and had to get married that what it is Jim a mistake I got to think about it so like insanely I qualified find them questionable choice for this position but like a 12 years with this company is your foster does he know what I can do it's trying to wipe me out twelve years like that what the letter back and let's get out of here Rita what you having ginger I don't want them to see him go back around the other way don't meet in the office put it back you gonna leave it understand you're just a kid I didn't need anything mr. Foster I'm sorry ginger I did just what was a surprise that heard what he said about me in his letter What did he say about you Halle you want to wear a bell around your neck Kelly doesn't mean you're her about anything it's getting late I better go home I promised my girls heads late good night good night what's your secret man I've been working on it for two months have you just too subtle it's not my business but took a big chance I did yeah I think if Overland finds you poking around in the confidential files he'd probably fire you right on the spot probably yeah but Dad I wouldn't worry about Kelly he won't find out unless somebody tells him well she's not telling exactly why should you we can't hold this thing here it's extending to the air-conditioning don't let this thing get around back of us we'll never get up he's broken through the 19th chief the air conditions must have tripped on the convoy that shut it off give me five more minutes we're bringing up 40 ejectives on the elevator right now I've got a really crew kimono I gotta shut the building down and get your light generators up to the fire floor one all right okay instead of Italian one Jeff go ahead Nicky get a crew down to the basement right away she chopped off a whole part of the building everything it's probably quick on fire something in the basement nothing to worry about Gigi mom you could I forget me Darlene would you get my briefcase that's that brown one on the desk in there you think I should go fireball that's a good idea but maybe we ought to find out what it is for it wonder if stash is still downstairs ten after eight on Christmas hating I don't know everything's gonna be all right ginger sorry it's smokey yeah yeah try not to breathe too much of this stuff well my clothes are gonna pick up this too that's a real tragedy elevators on his way up we should be out in the fresh air in a couple minutes this is one way to break up a party those are the emergency lights yeah there's that well can't you break it down or something solid steel Hong Kong fix that dead fly those lines over there we'll try the phones across the hall might be better to wait in my office least we'll be away from the smoke until we decide what to do but are we going we're gonna be safe this is a solid build ginger not barn all right you stick with me we're gonna we don't pitch this thing out here it's going to run sweat off the windows and it's a long way down give me some more line even though we can hardly see any visible evidence of a fire from our vantage point here on the street Fire Department tells us there are now at least seven floors involved and they still have not been able to bring it under control I remember now they sealed off these windows when I put in the air conditioning well can't you break one they're reinforced with wire good what to do anyway I mean but 40 stories high well we could yell with somebody down the street don't be stupid Betty they couldn't hear us from up here they could even see us at night might be why is it going easy on that stuff Howard that a management directive or just a personal opinion nothing like a little get-together with the Home Office once a year Dan we understand this is only about 30 minutes after the last group of people left the building where they had been having an office party on the top floor it can't be thankful that these lucky people are home now safe with their families what a blessing this fire didn't start earlier when the building was full of coolant the fire department is doing everything possible to arrest the flames but so far have been unsuccessful hello yes yes this is she yes Kenny I remember you uh I hate to bother you mrs.

out easy hold that and remember that we still had some host backs in the disabled elevator so we had their horse adorable it happened sometime after we kept our guard told us it was nobody else in the building come on the discovery of a body in the elevator shaft adds yet another grim complication to this Christmas Eve tragic read the victim has tentatively been identified as an employee of the hendrik industries which we understand occupies the top five floors in the Whitney talents the fire department now faces the possibility that there may be other people still trapped inside the building he didn't know ago my fault he's dead dead come on Kelly yeah guilty your tally remaining name though what difference does it make now a Fire Department helicopter is just landing to pick up a paramedic rescue team chief Packer is ordered an emergency search in the building from the roof down to the fire as you can see the rescue team is loading equipment aboard the helicopter they should be taking off momentarily in here in here we're moving in this West room okay okay be careful hey it's sweeping around life by the guy his whole burn through that's all she wrote thank you big enough we need to put a half 1:41 wall is collapsed on 36 to backtrack then you get them out we don't have to water them too much fire all right stick with it do what you can I'll get help up right away

captain Jones we've got two men buried up there I'll send up air bottles hurry I can't you do something but it won't change anything why did you do it though did you bring that out I thought somehow it might please you well how nice I thought for some obscure reason that hanging Benji started with care might make things a little happier around here don't you remember how he always used to go to the stocking first alright oh I could see this is gonna be a wonderful Christmas alright let's talk about it again never mind I said let's go me Dad no what about last month a picture of Benji at that summer camp and before that a relaxing evening with a stamp collection now it's got to stop Benji seems to be the only thing we have in common these days in fact I think he probably was the only thing we ever had that kept us together and we made a mistake obviously since we can't even talk about our own son anymore Benji is dead summer he's been dead for six months I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and your car Pharr is now completely out of control an attempt to stop it on the 36th floor has failed costing the life of one fireman and critically injuring several others if the rumor is true if there are still people on the upper floors there is grim doubt that they could survive the intense heat and smoke the fire department is still struggling desperately to stop the upper floors from being engulfed by flame but there doesn't seem to be much chance that they can do it here foolish line my air right here their rescue this is one after the truck get back in the air do a 360 around the building use your spotlight check the window see if there's any sign of people in the building we can't hold it here careful careful but stay together tell you one kitchen 45 we've lost the 38th floor we're backing out into the ceiling and going up the vent search team this is one can you read me we're going down a stairwell from the rope and there's a lot of smoke up here stay on monitor rescue they may need you fast Kenny aren't you he's out there is near you're not sure they know we're here they know me yeah paraone the search date got some people on the top floor looks like at
