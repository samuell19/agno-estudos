Believe me. But what most people fail to realize is that it's in the very nature of all things to change. Same as in life, as in carpentry. What we build today and hold dear, tomorrow, eventually decays. All we can really do to combat that is (phone ringing) keep the past in its place by preserving it, move forward and eventually build something newer. Symbiosis of the two structures. - [Lee] Hello. - [Mike] Lee, it's Mike. - Hey man, uh, could I call you back? I'm in the middle of somethin'. - I didn't now if you'd heard. Kurt Cobain, he's dead. - What? - Yeah, it happened this morning. - Dead? - Blew his face off with a shotgun. Proves my theory. All the greats, they're all cursed. - Aw, come on, Mike, he didn't die in a plane crash, okay? I mean, he blew his brains out. It's not a curse, if anything, it's a cure. - What's the matter with you, man? Are you building one of your bird things again? - Uh, no. - [Mike] 2 1/2 years and still with these bird houses. If you wanna win her back, build her a Ferrari. - I'm not building a bird house, okay, Mike. - Sometimes, I just don't get you. - Look, I'll see ya at seven, okay? - [Bill] This here, these archways. - Who's opening tonight? - This better be good. Last night was incredible. How'd you hear about this anyhow? (patrons chattering) - Ladies and gentlemen, The Handy Kaufmans. How's my favorite band, huh? - You're only band. - Still my favorite, sweetheart. - Where you been? - Tyin' things up for the tour. - What's it look like out there? - They want you on stage in five minutes. Good lookin' crowd too. We're gonna make some big money tonight. - For real? - No, there's nobody. - Frank, how we supposed to take any money if there's nobody comin-- - Di, da, da, I was yankin' his chain, brainiac. How many beers is that? Huh? What I tell you, what I say about drinkin' before you play? What did I say? You meshuggeneh, mamaluke drunk, you. you're on stage in five minutes, five minutes. - Hey, don't puke on the audience like last time, huh? - Hey Mike, how 'bout we switch and you play bass, and I play lead. - Clean it up, you got a deal. - Okay, captain Xanax.

(crowd cheering) (pee trickling) (electricity sizzling) (crowd gasping) Thank you, good night! (crowd cheering) (siren wailing) (Jim groaning) (women giggling) - Okay, we got drunk and disorderly, hard to argue with that one. Urinating in public, creating a fire hazard, and he's finin' us 250 extra bucks for scarin' old people. Since when is that against the fuckin' law? - What? - That's for later. - [Frank] Uh-huh. - [Mike] Trust me, you gotta do it. You need to scrub it tonight, Lee. - I know my wood, I don't need to scrub. - [Frank] Uh-huh. - Trust me, if the acid leaked through the wood, then it's goodbye drum kit. - Don't look at me. I'm not songwriter, not the maid. - Oy vey, just do not, are you kidding me? - Use warm water and disinfectant, that'll do the trick. - What are you, pee chemist? - [Frank] All right, yes I understand. - I tell you, Mike, he was looking me right eye. - You saying he did it on purpose? - [Lee] Yeah. - My cousin Dave pissed on a Christmas tree one year. Got drunk, thought he was on the lawn. - Kodak moment, thank you for sharing that special memory. He's out for six weeks. - Six weeks, what about the gigs? - What about the gigs? We gotta go, I can't cancel 'em with one week's notice. - So, he's outta commission for sure? - Yes, for sure, the guy's got third-degree burns on his hands and his schlong. - [Lee] Okay, so what are we supposed to do, Frank? - What's Flea up to, is he still with the Peppers? - All right, look, I'm gonna make some calls. We'll have somebody by Sunday night. - Frank, in two days? - Yes, in two days, you kidding me? From here to Manhattan, everybody knows Big Frank. - That's what we're worried about. - Ha ha, okay, just look, you trust me for once, okay? Would everybody just trust me? - Yeah, that's what you said before the show at Rikers Island. - Oh, now it's my fault that the warden suspended conjugals? - Tree smelled so bad that year, we opened the presents in the kitchen. - Can I possibly get some pie? (jazzy music) (dog barking) (tense music) - [Doreen] Lee, you haven't told us what you thought about the sermon this morning. - Uh, pass the green beans, please. - The answer's not in the green beans, son. - The answer's not in church either, Dad. - Well, your mother and I have some news. Doreen. - Your father and I have decided to sell the house. - Hey, outstanding. - What? Wait, wait. - We need some time for us. - Okay, hold on, slow down. I mean, we've been, we've been livin' in this place since I was seven years old. - You're 23. - Okay, so that's it, no discussion? - We discussed it quite a bit. - Did you expect Dad never to retire? - And Lee, you know how much I dreamed of taking a cross country drive. - I know, I know, it's just that, uh-- - You got a problem, son, just lay it out. - Well, I'm in the middle of a project right now. - Yeah, well, you're always in the middle of somethin'. - No, I'm gonna finish this one. I just need a little more time. - Yeah, we'll it's mine when you're done, kid. I've got a space to fill next to my Versace couch that, uh, Lee, could you do that chestnut stain I like. - Eh, don't get your motor all revved up, Elliott, it won't make any difference. - Okay, what, what's that supposed to mean? (Karl sighs) - It means, you might as well just clear all those projects out of the garage because you're not gonna finish 'em anyhow. - [Lee] That's not true. - It is true. I mean, you've abandoned every project you've started. You know, when you were 12 years old, you told me that you felt closer to God workin' on a bench than sittin' on one. So, I let you stay home on Sundays, and I made excuses down at services, and did I ever complain? Not once because I'll tell ya what, that's not what bothers me. You know what really bothers me? - Yeah, here we go. - None of it ever amounted to a damn thing. None of it. I mean, you never followed through on a single piece. Why is it you're so scared to finish anything? - Okay, uh, how 'bout I finish my potatoes, huh? (Kyle chuckles) - All right. But you think about this, smart ass. - Karl. - Now, you and those drunk friends of yours are gonna hit the road to do your little rock and roll show, right? Now, what happens if one of those pumpkin heads blows his dick off? I mean, you hit a snag like that, you're just gonna quit? And maybe you'll be fine, but just like those birdhouses, you'll find somethin' to screw things up just when everything's goin' right for ya. - Lee, all Dad's saying is that you execute a solid plan of action and you get results. - Thank you, Elliott. I mean, plan and follow through. - All you gotta do is look in the driveway to see that everything Dad taught me is right. - Another spear of wisdom from the prodigal son. - Hey, hey now, Elliott's not perfect. He got a little mixed up with girls and he drank too much a few times, but he had a compass. I'm tellin' ya somethin', and that compass told him when it was time to commit to something serious. - I wish you had the balls to come out and say it. What pisses you off is what I'm doing, not how I'm doing it. I mean, you want me to take the safe direction. You know, guaranteed success, but that's not what I want. I want something different, the kinda success that Morgan Stanley and Citibank can't offer, and that's what pisses you off. - Lee. - No, no! And here I am, you know, a constant reminder to you that you wanted to do something different and you didn't. You know, and maybe everything turned out okay. What burns is that your whole life was color by numbers. You know, you got what you thought you wanted, Dad, but you know what, actually, ya settled. Ya settled, and you know what, because you followed through, you followed through in your own fucking little box. - Don't you tell me how I-- - Enough! I would like to have one Sunday that did not end up in shouting. Can we just once celebrate what we are and what we have, rather than what we aren't and what we don't have, all right? - Yeah, maybe, we uh, maybe we could do that at the new house. (Kyle sighs) - Mom, could you pass the low cal dressing? (upbeat drumming) (singing faintly) - What time is it? - Quarter after nine. - I told people to be here by nine. - Jesus, I have a date at 10. - Your hand lotion does not count as a date. - So, my parents are goin' on the great Winnebago tour. My fucking asshole of a brother is happy to see me like thrown out on my ass. - When are they leavin'? - Six weeks, gotta get a job. - Lee, don't even think about it. - You're not baggin'? - Okay, guys, don't give up on your rock and roll dreams, all right? I'll just do a show, get a record deal, we'll go on tour, and once we're on the road, whether Mike likes it or not, I'll, you know, I'll be able to earn some money and maybe pay my rent, huh? - Be nice if it happens that way. - It's got to happen that way. - Hey man, I'm workin' on this new song. I was up all night scribblin' some things. - Wow, that's great, Mike. You're a genius, really. Now, I mean, they say geniuses have sloppy handwriting, so can I be in your band? My dad's always talkin' about how I'll get smarter if I hang out with more smart people. (slow knocking) - You want some? - Um, Nick. Where's your bass? - I was supposed to bring my bass? - Yeah. - Those were all the tryouts, those freaks? - Yeah, except for this friend of Lee's. - Friend of a friend of a friend. I haven't even met her. - Her, girls don't play bass. - Pixies, Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, buy some albums, dumb ass. - Is she comin', yes or no? - I don't know. - Great. - I'm just askin', Lee. - I'm just answering, Mike. - All right, all right, ladies, huh? Look, we got no bass player, so we're cancellin' the gigs. - No, no way. - Yeah, we can Lee, we got no choice. - You know, what if this is some kinda sign? I mean, a bad omen. - Oh, don't start, Mike. - A curse, I mean-- - Mike, you gotta be famous first before you can be cursed, okay? This isn't a sign, it's a test. Are we all gonna give up that easy? - Man, I don't wanna have to beg for my job back at the store. - No, no, no, we just, we just try that much harder, okay? It's no over, not yet. - I didn't say it was over. - Could we all stop acting like such a bunch of Goddamn pussies here? - [Trixie] I heard pussy and I figured you meant me, so I didn't knock. - [Lee] Are you Trixie? - Go Speed Racer, go. - Uh, okay, um, I'm Lee. Didn't know you were gonna make it. - Neither did I. Where can I plug in? - Where can I? - [Lee] Uh, that's, that's Big Frank, he's our manager. - [Trixie] Big Frank, huh? You making up for a little hot dog? (Mike laughing) - [Frank] What are you laughing at, pinky. - Look, you can just plug on in to the PA. That's Donnie, that's Mike. - Hey guys. - What's up? - Look, it's late, can we just jump on in? We'll chat later. - All action, no talk, huh? All right. - You, uh, don't have any aspirations to switch now and again, do you? - Well now, rock star, depends on what you mean by switch. - Oh my God. - I, uh, instruments. Uh, forget it, let's just play Wish You Were Dead. - Whoa, oh, oh, we're not doin' that song. That was BD, before Donnie. - Grab your little microphone, big boy. Let's play.

You got that? - I got that, ma'am, and we are on stage in five. (crowd cheering) (upbeat rock music) Careful goin' home. Hey, no hard feelings, huh?

Business sense. - What? Were you sleeping during that last gig? - No, you're not hearing me. It's like you're opposite sides of the same coin, right? You have something that he wants and vice versa. - Yeah, what do you know? - I think it's kinda like us, you know? I have something that you want and vice versa. - I do. - Mm-hmm, I'm a musician, remember? I love what I do and I get paid for it. That's what you want, right? - And what if I can't get what I want? - Well, you know what they say, somethings you get what you need. - Okay, wait, so what you're telling me is that you have what I want, so what is that I have that you-- - Hey, we got problems. - What, what's the problem? - Uh, we're missin' like 400 bucks here. - Sir, we take all major credit cards. Yeah, yeah, I know, thank you, uh. Listen, I don't have any plastic. You guys got, anybody? - Don't believe in them. - Me either. - My parents cut mine up. - [Trixie] What about Mike?

Practicin', Mike? - Tweakin' the new take. - [Frank] You got something you wanna tell me? - I'm still stuck for lyrics. - [Frank] Don't insult me, okay? Don't insult me! - Hey, I'm trying to be positive. Everybody else has been bickerin', so I'm out here workin' our first big hit. - Where the fuck is the money, Mike? Huh, the money, what'd you do with the money? - Easy, easy, would you listen. I needed to fix my amp before we left. - Your amp, come on, Mike, you didn't need to fix your amp. Are you kiddin' me? What, am I fucking stupid here? You know what you're doin' to us, huh? We get pulled over and you got a backpack full of shit, and we're all in slam pickin' up soap, not just you. Do you fuckin' get that? - You can go through everything, I'm clean. I decided before the tour, I'm done with that stuff. - You better not be lyin' to me, Mikey. I swear to God if you are lying to me, I am gonna fucking beat you. - I'm not! Just don't tell Lee, all right-- - Lee, Lee? Lee is the least of your fuckin' problems. - Please Frank! - Yeah, yeah. $400, Mike, $400, man, come on. All right, listen, if you're clean, you answer me one question, you tell me the truth right now. What made you think you could take our money? What the fuck, and don't give me the amp shit. What? - I owed, it was serious. - All right. You paid off? - Yeah. - And you're clean? - Yeah. - Mikey, come on, man, are you clean, are you? - I swear, yeah. - All right, all right, all right. Look, here's what we're gonna do. It was my 400, all right, my 400 bucks. You borrowed it from me, so you just pay it back to me, okay? Just whenever, whatever, no time frame, no interest. Just, just pay it back, okay? And Mike, listen to me now. Don't disappoint me again. - I won't, I promise, Frank. - Promise? (car alarm wailing) Just like last time. Uh, all right, my bad, again. I, uh, I, uh, I forget I took the money last week. I took the 400 out. - For what? - For uh, for, for, for the car. My sister had extra insurance on the car, so I took the 400 out. Sorry. 400 bucks for six weeks. - [Trixie] Frank, it's a lousy station wagon. - Hey. She was doin' us a favor. - Well, that's terrific. Maybe the gratitude'll pay our expenses for what, two weeks? - Just, you know what, I'll think of somethin'. Just shut up for a minute. - Where are we supposed to go, man? - Maybe I should call Tom. - You shithead, 'cause of you, we're probably gonna have to sleep in this wagon because you lost 400 bucks. You know what, shut up for five minutes, will ya? I had enough outta you. - Keep your fat claws off of me, okay? - You know what your problem is, Lee? All you ever think about is yourself. You don't see the big picture. If you looked around-- - Maybe we're screwed. - No, you wouldn't see that, you know what you'd see? You'd see people that try to do something for you and everybody else and themself too. - Oh, do for somebody else, Frank? - Yeah. - Knowing you, you probably spent the money on a whore and a lotto ticket. (Lee groans) - Maybe there's a campground nearby. Not like we have any gear. - [Donnie] No one's got any relatives out here? - I wasn't gonna say nothin' because, now look, we got not choice. I could call Janine. She, uh, moved out here a couple of months ago. - Frank, Janine? Are you nuts? - We're still friendly, you know, sort of. - When's the last time you talked to her? - That depends on how you define the word talk. - Well, I'm not talkin' about the time she cracked a pan over your head after she walked in on you porkin' her roommate. She still livin' with, uh, what's his name? - Kim Wong. Ugh, Kim Wong, no. - [Trixie] Oh, I get it, you broke up with her. - Yes, okay, well, you know, I had some commitment issues, you know? But listen, she was always number one right here. Pretty much. Jeanie, hey, hey, I owe ya, huh? We're in a pinch. - Janine. Jeanie was the chick before me, dick. - Janine, right, I knew that, sorry, Janine. (Janine groans) - Look, pillows and blankets are in the closet upstairs. Why don't you go ahead and get them, Franz. - (laughs) Franz, I tell ya, she's good, she's still very, all right. You stay, okay. - We'll be outta here first thing tomorrow. You wouldn't even know we were here. - He's a piece of shit. You all know that, right? A cheating piece of shit. - [Frank] Right up here honey, piece of shit heard ya. - Hey, there's no need to hold a grudge, okay? - We were going out for three years. - What the hell are we doing here? - I don't know. - You know, I never had anything against you guys. It's just it's to bad you still hang out with him. You know you can't trust a maggot like that, right? - Janine, babe, why don't you head upstairs. We'll be in bed soon. Just forget we ever came. - You know what, I bet he thinks he's gonna get some. Donnie, have you been working out? Lifting weights, anything? - Yeah, well, yeah, a little, I guess. - No, you haven't. - Hey, I work up a sweat on stage, okay? - Hey, uh, Janine, um, why don't you just head on upstairs. You must be exhausted, huh? We'll take care of everything down here. - Okay, yeah. I need a hot a shower anyway. - Goodnight. - Yeah, thanks again. - Yeah, thanks. - Hey. So, you, uh, you know, you uh? (Janine scoffs) All right, goodnight. (Frank sighs) Uh. So look, uh, crazy shit happens, you know. Sorry, but hey, that's the charm of it, you know? You wanna cozy comfy life, you go work in a bank. You want a little adventure, a little, you know, a little fun, you join a band. (thunder rumbling) Lee, I'm sorry I rapped ya in the jaw. - Eh, don't worry about it, I was being a jerk. - Man, I was gettin' some vibes. - [Frank] What did you just say? - Ah, no, nothin'. - All right, just forget about it. Tomorrow's another day, we're one day closer to that fair. - One day closer to Haskell Benjamin. - One day closer to gettin' signed. All right, come on, get it in here. Come on, come on. One, two, three. - [All] Rock stars. - [Janine] Hey Donnie, my drain's clogged up here. You wanna come up here and give me a hand. (Janine moaning and panting) (Frank snoring) (Janine moaning) Oh yeah. (Frank snoring) Yeah. - [Donnie] Oh, oh. (moaning) - [Janine] Yes! Oh, mama likes it. Oh yeah. (Donnie moaning) Yes. - I'll be in the car. - Yes. (Donnie and Janine moaning) (Donnie grunting) (loud slapping) - [Janine] Right here, yeah. - [Donnie] Yeah. - [Janine] Yeah. - Why Donnie? - Yeah! - Why Donnie? (Janine moaning) (Donnie grunting) You know what, I'm officially in hell. - Yes! - I'm gonna go puke my guts out on the front lawn if anyone needs me. - [Janine] Oh, mama likes it! (Donnie and Janine moaning) (Donnie grunting) (Janine sighs) - You, uh, want some water? - How's your jaw? - Eh, it's fine. - How's your ego? (gentle music) - Do you think he's right? - About what exactly? - You know, seein' the whole big picture. - Maybe. Lee, it's a good thing, okay? It shows how focused you are. So, maybe you lose sight of the big pictures sometimes. That's what a shot in the mouth is for. - Yeah. I just, I clamp on so tight sometimes, you know? I try to relax, go with the flow, just doesn't come easy for me. - Don't be afraid to let go. - Yeah, but of what and when? - Of thoughts like that, now. I know how hard it is. We have a lot in common. After all, I'm bass, your drums. We're the rhythm section, we're like yin and yang. - Yeah, but it would be the same-- - What? - Well, it would be the same in any other band. - No, it's not, it's not arbitrary. - It's not? - No, we play well together. - Yeah, I guess we do. - Yeah. And I think we understand each other, you know? And there's a certain vibe between us. And hey, we even like each other. - We do? - Lee, come on. - Well, I don't wanna answer for you. - Okay, then answer for yourself. - Okay, yeah, yeah. I do. - There you have it. - Well, do you, I mean, do you? - What do you think? - I don't know, how am I supposed to know? - You've got eyes. - Yeah, well, I wanna be sure. - Is there anything sure in this world? - (sighs) Yeah, yeah. I mean, no. I mean, look, Trixie, it's just, I just don't want things to go weird between us, you know? Like in other bands, like the Mamas and the Papas or John and Yoko or anything. - Shh. - I'm a hopeless romantic. - You know that vibe thing? - Yeah. - Well, I've got a feeling that you wanna kiss me right now. - You have a boyfriend. - Do you? - Have a boyfriend? Uh, no. - Do you wanna kiss me right now? - Yeah. - I knew it. - Do you want me to kiss you? - Yes. - Yeah? - Absolutely. - Okay. (loud knocking) - Get your shit, we're leavin'. Sorry, I interrupt something? - What do you mean, we're leaving? - Shh, shh, Janine's sleeping. - Oh no, we are not-- - Where are the guys? - Fuck 'em and chuck 'em, eh, Donnie? - I wrote her a note. - You wrote her a note? - Well, I will. - Donnie, it's 3:00 a.m., where the hell are we gonna go?

Ooh. - Karl, you ready? - I think so. - Where'd you get that? - I've been saving up for 20 years. Is that enough? - Well, you're a little short. I tell you what. We got a sale on, today only.

Maybe the muse will come. - Hey, don't forget your guitar this time, huh Mike? - Frank. - Hey, how'd the writing go last night? Guess what fell out of your bag, Mike? - Look, I don't know what that is. - Well, it's not the stuff I sprinkle on my fucking pancakes, Mike! Come on! (gentle music) - [Lee] You know, I used to go to college here. - Huh. - Yeah. - Not bad. - Not bad? (church bell rings) Yeah, and Mike went here as well, you know? He wanted to keep the band together. Then, when I started failing, I decided I'd drop out of college. He went back with me to Jersey. It's weird you being here. It seems a lot more beautiful. - Donnie, is it? - [Donnie] Mm-hmm. - Well, Mr. Cute Young Thing, here's the deal, see. I got a man in love with me for 11 years, and three children who mean the world to me. - Hey, that's cool. I won't tell if you won't tell. (gentle music) - [Trixie] It's sad. - [Lee] What, the music? Nah, it's beautiful. - [Trixie] No, I meant the church. - [Lee] Oh, I never got into church services or anything, you know. I just went there 'cause it was quiet and I could clear my head. - [Trixie] Hmm, it's old. Kind of reminds me of funerals or weddings, you know? Same thing. - [Lee] Should we go? - What could you possibly have to offer me, other than a load of baggage labeled juvenile delinquent? Slacker? Not enough love at home? (Donnie chuckles) How many hot older chicks have you tiptoed out on in the middle of the night? It's not gonna make up for your mama leaving you. - I think maybe we should head on back to the hotel, you know? Get some rest before the gig? It was a late night last night, hmm? - Lee, about last night. - [Lee] It was amazing. - A mistake. - Okay, Miss Devoted Mother and Wife. And what are you doing in a place like this on a Saturday afternoon? - It's my stepson's 21st birthday, and I wanted to take him and his friends out for a drink, so if you'll excuse me, I'd like to freshen up. Thanks for the cocktail. - You lied to my face. (tense music) To my face! If we didn't have the most important show of our life tonight, I would do to you what I'm gonna do with this. (toilet flushing) - [Mike] Frank, wait. - Look um, I feel terrible about this mess. - Mess? What mess? - [Mike] Look, I promise you-- - Shut up, Mike, shut the fuck up! Don't promise me anything! I swear to God, Mike, I'm holding back the urge to smash your fucking face in right now, man. All right, after the show tonight, we're all gonna figure out what happens to you. Until then, get the fuck outta here! - Is this about Tom? - No, God no. Not. Look. I don't feel guilty about Tom, okay? I, Lee I just, I got caught up in you and the tour and the excitement and everything else. I just, I forgot who I was, you know? - Well, call me crazy, I uh, I kinda thought we helped each other remember who we are. - I'm sorry. You know, but one day you're gonna realize that I'm doing this because I really do care about you. - You know, my uh, my parents told me that years back, and I'm still waiting for the day to come. (patrons chattering) - What a cunt. - [Man In Red Shirt] What? - Chick that was sittin' there. - Oh yeah, what about her? - She wanted me and I told her to take a hike. She got pissed. (man in red shirt sighs) - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Total bitch. - That bitch was my mom, you fuck head. - Ah. Yeah, well she's pretty hot for a mom. (Donnie groans) - [Patron] Whoa, whoa, whoa. (Donnie groaning) Kick his ass! - I promise. (Frank sighs) - You know what I love about musicians? They're the only people who really understand a perfect moment, you know? Sometimes, and you don't know when, but just, it happens. The music's going and you're playing, and everything's working beautifully, and just, time just stops and all that matters is the music, just that one perfect moment. - Yeah, well, I kinda thought we had that off stage too. - Exactly. So, let's not ruin it by trying to chase it or duplicate it because you never can. Let's just see that one perfect moment frozen in amber and be thankful we ever had it. (children laughing) (children chattering) - [Receptionist] I'm sorry, Mr. Benjamin is out of the office. - Oh great, so he knows the concert's at 9:00 p.m. tonight, right? South stage. - You misunderstand me. Mr. Benjamin is on the Isle of Lucy at a benefit concert. Shall I take a message? - Um, can I, can I talk to Sue. I need to talk to Sue. - [Receptionist] She's out of the office as well. - [Lee] Oh my God, um. The Isle of Lucy? - Yes, he'll be back next Tuesday. - So, I guess he's not Upstate? - He's not even in America. (dial tone buzzing) (sullen music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Donnie, you got a second? Here, look these over. - Finally. Yeah, okay, good. Yeah. Uh. These are different than before, Mike, like, um, happy. - Yeah, I wasn't sure if you'd like 'em. - What happened, man? - Could ask you the same thing. - Yeah. (chuckles) (upbeat drumming) - [Lee] Is anything coming out of that monitor? - No. - [Donnie] Try this. That sandwich is not sitting right. - You always overdo it, man. - [Sound Guy] Let me hear the kick drum. (drum beating) - [Lee] Shit, shit. - You need a minute to replace that? - [Donnie] What's the problem? - It's after five, nobody'll be open. - Frank! - Where am I gonna find one now? - [Donnie] I don't know, just find a place. - Where, Drumtown, Drums R Us, you know what time it is? - 22 inch! - Relax, this our night, nothing can go wrong. Eat my penis! (feedback squealing) (tense music) - Oy, it's me, all right. Hello, come on, I'm here already. - Okay, who the hell needs the drumhead. - 22 inch. - 22 inch. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You got it or what? - Yeah, I got it. - All right, uh. - 22 bucks. - All right, you know what, I got a little, uh, just a second. Oy vey. (Duke laughs) - Hey, forget the two. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You're all right. - Yeah. Knock 'em dead, kid. - Will do, it's a good-lookin' suit. (Duke laughs) - Thanks. Who's your tailor? - Oh! (laughs) (crowd chattering) - [Attendee] Bring me some beer. - Look at them pouring in. This Benjamin guy's in for some show. - Mm, have you seen him? - I don't know what he looks like. - Oh genius, does anybody? - It'll be fine. - [Attendee] Hey, over here. - [Attendee] Be back in a second. - Hi, honey! Lee, we're here, honey! Honey, we're here! (gentle music) - [Mike] Hey Lee, you got a minute? - Mike, can't it wait till after the show? - I wanted to say somethin'. Um, you know we've known each other for a long time. I mean, it's weird, we're back here in this town, and even though that was a couple years ago, nothing's really changed. - Hold still. - You play, I'll sing, let Frank worry about everything else. No sweat. - Wait, Donnie, what's gotten into you? You actually sound like a front man. - Maybe I never got respect 'cause I never deserved it. - You're not gonna get any until, until you respect yourself, Mike, okay? You're not gonna get what you're lookin' for until you get outta your own fuckin' way. - I still want it all, Lee. I don't wanna give up. - You're a pretty good bass player. - Thanks? Wow, does it ever stop with you. (laughs) Hold still. - So, you wanna make out? (Trixie laughing) - [Trixie] God. - What, is that a yes (Trixie laughing) - What do you think? - I don't know. - The fans, the fame, the lifestyle, it could be real for us. - Is that what you want? Money, fame, celebrity? Mike, there was a guy in Seattle who got all that, and he couldn't handle it. Stop trying to be a phenomenon, just be a musician. Be a person. - I'm trying so hard, and you have no idea. Just don't give up on me, Lee. - Is there somethin' you wanna tell me? - I've lied to you guys. You know, I've been stupid and probably woulda kept it up, but I got caught. See, ever since I could remember, there's been this wishing that I could be something, you know? Anything other than what people expect. - I know all about that, Mike. We've been growing up on the same street since we were five years old. - I've tried everything I could think of to figure out who I am, except to just be who I am. I don't know how to do that just yet, but a part of it means being your friend again. I'm sorry, Lee. - You know what, Mike, there is nothing you could possible do or say to ruin this night. - Yeah, look at this. Thanks, Lee. - Donnie tells me we got some new lyrics. You know, they're different. - I don't know, I guess I just stepped away, and there they were. - Don't ever think you're mediocre, Mike. (tense music) - Let go. Let go. Ladies and gentlemen, the Onondaga County Fair is proud to welcome from New York City, give them a big Syracuse welcome, The Handy Kaufmans! (crowd cheering) - Yeah, yeah, come on, baby.

We were counting on him! - Me? - Music biz people, should have known. - Oh, come on! Would you listen to us? Like we deserve something, like he owes us! - We needed him. - We wanted him! - There's no difference. - Yeah, there is, Donnie. Hole in the bird house isn't gonna get any bigger, guys. - What the fuck does that mean? - Means I figured it out. I'm done, it means, it's over. (sullen music) - Okay. What is this? - It's called seeing the big picture, Frank. Remember that speech? I mean, come on guys We've been doing this for four fucking years, and we've taken it as far as it'll go. You know, I've given it my all. (Lee sighs) It's time to move on. I don't need this anymore. After tonight, I'm out. - I just figured it out. Your dad was here, huh?
