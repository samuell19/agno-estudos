These days, people in our country make elementary school students study very hard for the school entrance exams. This is why your children, many of them experience physical illnesses, decreased vision, nervous breakdowns and indigestion amongst other things. They experience a lot of problems as they grow up. Nowadays, our children's general education shouldn't just focus on the entrance exam. It should focus on the very basics of general education, but it should also be fundamental in teaching our children how to become good human beings. Many analysts claim the private education sector will grow. But the government is strict. By publishing its own textbooks, it aims to limit the growth of the industry. That's why leading private companies such as Megastudy are having problems growing. That situation is here to stay. However, their annual sales still amount to 25 million euro, so the chance that their shares will change dramatically is small. Good morning. For three questions, it takes 30 minutes. Does it? It's hot. Put it over there. This is too small. This here... Yes, this. Can you make it bigger? Just a little bit. If this one word is fixed in the square box, then it's fine. – The remote control still doesn't work? – It takes time to install. You'd better do it without. No, I'll use the remote control. It's awesome. The ends justify the means. The ends justify the means. Well, you have done the best you can. What's the font size on this? I mean, on this Powerpoint? – You still can't see it on that side. – Because you're blocking it. Please go and sit as far away as possible. "Inverse ratio." Can you read this? On this row, it's no problem. But this row here... So students can only sit on this side? And not over there? Wow. So we can only fit 80 students into this classroom. Only 80 students? For this internet lecture? This is a problem. – What is your goal? – What is your goal? – I'm not sure. I don't really know. You should get a job that involves public speaking. That's your goal. – Speaking? – Yes, speaking. She has to earn her living by speaking to people. In a way, this child is descended from lecturers. You should be a lecturer. You want to become a professor, right? Someone who teaches. Becoming a teacher is really my destiny? Yes, of course. But you have to be more than just a teacher. You should dream of becoming a professor. She is the pillar of your family. Her father has failed. – Your father failed. – That's right. – Your father is smart. – Her father wanted to get a PhD, but... Right, but she will succeed. I will make it happen. Grandfather, Grandmother... Our Hyunha will study hard and her mother will support her. So what I'm telling them now... Will it come true? Should I pick one? Which one is it? Why is your future always so bright? Why is your future so bright? She said it's bright. You should study more. You shouldn't have a boyfriend right now. You can't do two things at the same time. She has a pretty face and she has a nice figure. She also speaks well and she is smart. So you will succeed. She will succeed early in life. It won't take very long. But you should work really hard for it. Just don't let her drive a car. Most Koreans want to go to a good university. But when I speak to older people, they usually say that a good university isn't everything. So I just hope that's true. But for the average student, grades are more important than friends. They are more concerned with midterm and final exams than spending time with family or going on holiday. An education system that only focuses on getting into university isn't that bad. But studying until 11pm each night isn't right, especially when you're a teenager. From elementary school to high school we usually only come home around 11pm. So we barely get to see our family. That's sad. Hurry up and get back to class. Hurry up and get back to class! What are you doing here? Why aren't you in class, you rascals? Get out of here. Now! I didn't do it. But Dad, you studied so hard, didn't you? Not really, no. I didn't really study when I was in school. No need to tell us that. We know you didn't. – Yes, we know. – I didn't study that much, really. You only told me after we got married. If I had known, I wouldn't have married you. I should have studied like Hyunha. Then you could have gone to a better university. Seoul National University. – With his smart brain. – I couldn't have gotten into SNU. How come you lost your hair if you didn't even study that much? That's why I study now even though I'm so old. Even today, I learnt about a really difficult subject at work. You should have studied when you still had lots of hair. A really hard subject. Aren't you going to ask me which subject? How should I know? Physics. It gives me a headache and makes me bald. I studied this microwave... induced... plasma... mass spectrometer. That's what I learnt about. It hasn't been released yet. Really? That's why I want to develop it. So Dad, you'll be the first developer? I will try to develop it. So you'll win the Nobel Prize in Physics? – Could you win it? – If I... The sound is OK, right? You'd better start a little later. – About a minute? – I don't care. – There'll be a movie clip of me, right? – Yes, with music. I'm Kim Ki Hoon, the main English teacher for the Suneung exam. With my astounding teaching skills, I will guide you through difficult university admissions. I will give you real English skills to make your dream become a reality. The greatest English teacher ever, with more than 1.5 million students. The English teacher acknowledged by world media such as "Wall Street Journal", "TIME", etc.' No matter how it changes, no matter what changes, there is only one goal. Real English Skills Ladies and gentlemen, I am Kim Ki Hoon, the main English teacher at Megastudy. Hello! As you all know, the Korean university entrance exam policy has been fluctuating for several years now. I was hoping this year would be stable compared to previous years, when students became victims of real confusion. But at the start of the new year, the confusion has already begun again. By making the Suneung exam easy, this government is trying to limit private education. So your only option is to get a perfect score. Especially for those students who are aiming for the top universities, if the decisive grade in English is 95%, 96% or 97%, then your grade will be decided by just one question. So there's some real chaos coming. It's very obvious. I will let you know exactly how you should deal with this situation. No, he didn't swear. He was quite funny. No, he didn't just say we have to study hard. He really explained how to get into university. But we do still have to study hard. He said the Suneung exam is important. So we'd be better off studying for that instead of the school exams. When I was in middle school, I was pretty good at studying. People thought I would, without a doubt, get into Seoul National University. And then I sort of lost interest in studying when I started high school. I think it upset my mother. I was upset too, but I think she was more upset. I don't have many regrets, but... My mom and relatives always said, "Hyein will definitely get into one of the SKY Universities." Now I'm not even sure if I can get into any university at all. When I look back, I feel proud at times. But when my grades drop... I feel like my mom is a bit ashamed and disappointed in me. This year, I will be in charge of guiding your school life. So, discipline has changed a bit. For male students, your hair in front should be short and your ears should be hidden. And... if we can't see your neck, then you must open your collar. For female students, two things are not allowed. Dyed hair and a curly perm. Not allowed. Basic make–up is allowed. Do it. For all our sakes, please do it. Examinees, please listen carefully and relax your mind. The listening exam will start without warning. Hello, everyone. My name is Jung Hye–in. I'm going to play the First Movement of Sonatina no. 15. Wow, look at how young I was then. Ladies and gentlemen! Please welcome Kim Ki Hoon! Good to see you. –Wow, you're really handsome. –Yes, I hear that all the time. Now I know why you're so popular. You're funny and handsome. Kim Ki Hoon's special English lecture will begin right now! Raise your hand if you didn't have enough time in the March mock exam. Who didn't have enough time? OK, most of you raised your hands. So why didn't you have the time? First of all, you should consider the regular admission process. Why are your scores on the Suneung mock exam so low? – Did you revise badly? – Yes. – Why? – I don't know. It's just all so crazy. There's my grades I have to worry about and the time is just... How should I put it? It's like I had a flat tyre and all the air went out. I think it would be possible for you to get into both Sookmyung University and Ewha University. If she insists on going to university this year and you want to play it safe, then you should consider going to a lower level university. It's up to you. OK? Hyein was really good at studying when she was in middle school. – You make me crazy. – All this pressure. – So annoying. – She was good at studying. So we thought she'd apply for SKY universities. Even with her score, I was convinced she could apply for SKY. So in Hyein's case, you have to make a bottom line of universities and then apply for them. By the way, I don't think repeating is that scary. I repeated one year and it was really tough. I also repeated one year! I did it and... – It was so tough. – Why was it tough? It was a happy time for me! – You have four minutes left! – We still have four minutes. Hey, is anyone going to keep studying after midnight? After midnight? I will, but after I take a break. I'm tired. – Starting tomorrow, then? – No, I need at least one week of rest. So you'll start ten days before the exam? – I've been very stressed recently. – Why? – I'm in danger now. – Why? I think I'm in a slump after the June mock exam. – Really? – Today I felt completely lost. – What do you want me to do with it? – Hurry up! – Your nails must hurt. – What? – Don't your nails hurt? – No, they don't. They must hurt, seriously. They don't hurt. I've been biting them. But it hurts, right? – What's up with you? – Use it. What's happened to you? Have you gone crazy? – Use it well! – You're crazy. Nobody hurt me. I was biting them during the mock exam. I get really stressed when I can't answer the questions. I never usually bite my nails, but during exams, I bite all of them. Usually I never. But during exams... Tomorrow I should wake up at 6:30am again. Wake me up when you do. I should wake up early and I should... – Then wake me up early. – I don't believe you. – You lost your faith in us. – You are... What are you guys doing? – We're going to sleep soon. – Sleep. Don't chat, OK? Good night. What grade do you need to get into Korea University? – One, one, one, one, one. – All of them? – That's really tough. – Everyone who is successful... The ugly man does not have the authority to speak. Has experienced failure. To get into Korea University, I should be in the top 0.01% of students. 0.01% of all students in Korea. It just doesn't make sense. For Seoul National University, I should also be in the top 0.01%. For Yonsei and Korea University it's the top 0.1%. 150,000 students are taking Science and 450,000 taking Humanity Studies. 0.01% of 450,000... Ah, it drives me crazy. When I become an adult, I want to be able to protect the people around me. If other people try to hurt them or if they get in trouble, and I'm not able to protect them, or I can only stand by helplessly and watch them get hurt, then I don't think I could live with myself. I wouldn't be able to bear it. So to avoid this, I should make sure that I'm better than other people. By going to Korea University, I think I can climb up a level. There I will meet people who are on the same level. By competing with them, I can rise to a higher level again. I will become the person on the top of the food chain. The name value of Korea University will determine how other people will look at me. Come out quickly. Repeat your number. – Stop! Repeat your number. – One. – Two. – Three. – Four. – Five. – Forty four. – Forty five. – Forty six. – Forty seven. – Forty eight. – Finish. Your number is 49, isn't it? Your number is 49, isn't it? Someone quit. He left yesterday. One person left earlier. – What? – One person left earlier. OK, wash yourself and have some food. All students, you have five minutes to leave the dormitory. All students, you have five minutes to leave the dormitory. Listen up. Everyone, it's time to exercise. Head first and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Louder. Two, three... Four... Five... stop. Put two hands on the shoulder of the person in front of you. Let's get rid of the stress for five seconds. One... two... three... When I'm teaching, in front of the class, I say... Then the students say... Or remember it like this. "Time", "Have", "Time", "Have". Today is D–100, right? From now on, if you wake up and you don't study, if you doze off in class, if you have a chat with friends after lunch, then none of your wishes will come true. It will be a disaster. Gradually, your brain gets healthier so you start feeling comfortable when you study. Your head becomes clear, especially when you're studying, and you feel at peace. You feel more comfortable and your head becomes clearer. You feel happier and finally you can focus. You are able to concentrate better. Every subject you study is easy. Your confidence grows. You feel good when you study. Even when you take the exam, you feel good. On the exam day, you are in perfect condition. You are able to concentrate on the exam and answer all of the questions in peace. As you take the exam, you feel comfortable and peaceful. Concentrating perfectly, you remember everything you have studied. Gradually you become better at the exam. I never thought this year would be so difficult. Usually, there's a student with a great school record or some talent, a student who can get accepted to a good university and whose application I don't have to worry about. I've never been as worried as I am this year. How can I make you get accepted? Based on your current score, the universities you can apply for are the college of Theology or a university outside of Seoul, including any evening programmes. But you want to go to Korea University. To get into the top university, you need a perfect score on all subjects. But since your scores are so bad, what's your strategy? What about a university that doesn't care about my maths score? You can't get into a university if all your scores are bad. – That's why you can't apply. – There is really no way? If you improve this, then... You should at least have second grade. Then your total would be grade nine. I got one question wrong, so I couldn't reach the second grade. One question decides your success or failure. It's normal. I got 96 in Korean. And still it's only third grade. I really want to die. What about last year? You were above the cut–off point. These days, I don't study Korean. I only study English. But the score isn't bad. I haven't studied Korean since the mock exam in June. English is the only subject that has improved since last year. Is this the result for which you've studied the entire year? Only ten days remain until the Suneung exam. Many of you must be nervous right now. Make sure to review the questions you got wrong and take care of your health. Yoonjung Shin reports. The first truck carrying the Suneung exam papers departed at 8:00am. Just like last year, there are 85 types of exam papers. They will be transported to the exam centres at dawn. For heavy security, the education authorities deployed 400 employees. During transportation, they will also be protected by the police. To ensure a smooth transport, the Ministry of Education has asked people to follow the directions of the police when encountering the trucks. If you really want it, then let other people know. Tell your mother, "I'm going to this university." At first, your mother will ignore you. She'll tell you it's impossible. But keep telling her and your mom will feel the pressure. She will believe that you want to go there. By praying with her, your score will increase and you will get accepted. Even me. I had a very bad score. "My Lord, please raise my math score." I prayed to God without really believing it would improve. But it did. That's the amazing thing. You pray to God without believing that your score will improve. But you're not late. Monday, Tuesday, and if possible, Sunday too. Just study, please. And I want to ask the parents, pray to God that your children will not get stressed in the time that remains. If they do their best, their scores will improve. This is the truth. Please rely on Him and pray to Him. So, this is the last class. That makes me a bit sad. You will be good at the Suneung exam. You will be really good at it. I pray for you every day. I'm Christian, but it doesn't matter what I am. Kim Ki Hoon is Christian and prays, but what if you're a Buddhist? Or a Muslim? I just pray for the children who believe in me and who follow me until the very end. I pray that you will do your best, that you won't make any mistakes, and that if you have to guess any answers, that you can guess them correctly. God should care about this, right? You will do well. I just wrote down "Be the Miracle". Raise your hand if you don't know where this phrase comes from. For those of you who don't know, I'll tell you. There's a movie, Bruce Almighty. Morgan Freeman plays God. In it, Jim Carrey plays a normal person. Morgan Freeman says to Jim Carrey, "Do you want to see a miracle, son?" "Be the miracle." When I heard this, I started screaming in the cinema. People stared as I went, "Ah!" I was so touched that I made a song for that year's Suneung exam called I Will Be The Miracle. So I have used "Be the Miracle" several times. It's time for roll call. 304, close the door. Stand up straight! Why are you moving? Don't you know the meaning of "attention"? Stand up straight. Why is it so hard to do roll call? You will definitely be chatting later. I know it. Calm down now, OK? Students who'll keep studying after midnight, raise your hands. Shout your number when you lower your hand. Hurry up. Are you studying after midnight? Come on. What time are you going to bed? Aren't you tired? Even if I'm tired, I need to finish this. – What are you doing now? – Rapid Progress. Seriously? – I couldn't finish it today. – I had a perfect score on that today. – Can Minjun answer the question? – There is... – The answer is always in the question. – The answer is two. If I combine three of these, then I can get the answer. – Yes, I solved it. – It doesn't require calculus. The Maths in the Science section is easy. I think I get it. You think this is from the Science section? The question about the Gregorian calendar. Lots of students got that question wrong. – Here, the question with the example. – They got this wrong. It's too difficult. I don't get it. It's near the 2.3%. So if I have four questions wrong... After bowing 108 times, I feel pain if I don't stretch. But when I stretch, I feel pain too. So I better not... I'm losing my mind. I'm a complete failure. I'm a complete failure. Mom, are you going to bed? – No. How can I? – You won't? – Then I'll study at the table. – OK. Listen carefully, because the man has no work to do. He says he'll send the free brochure by mail. But he also mentions the hotel's website. So he gives two alternatives. So what she wants is the website address. The man agrees by saying "Great", so the right answer is number four. So be careful when answering questions ten and eleven. Everyone, listen up. Do you have the paper in front of you with the special notices for applicants? OK, then. Right now, every second is precious to you. So I'll quickly tell you the general and essential things you should be aware of and then I'll leave you to it. I'm Jung Miyoung, the school supervisor for the Hwaseong Education Office. You might not know this, you might do it by mistake, but if you bring in any prohibited items or you do something that is not allowed, it can and will be regarded as cheating. That's why I'm here to help you. So listen carefully. I'm also praying that all of you will get a good score since you have worked so hard for it. So let's start by turning the cover page. Have a look at the second page. This is a teachers' announcement. Please listen carefully. Tomorrow is Suneung day. There will be the usual traffic jam. Go to the exam centre today so you know how long it takes to get there. You should arrive there at least 15 to 20 minutes early and make your way to the exam room. Good luck with the Suneung exam tomorrow. I hope all of you get a good result. Let's all meet at 10:00am on Friday morning with big smiles on our faces. One day left until the Suneung exam. The Suneung exam is held only once a year. The way you feel on the actual Suneung day can make a difference, no matter how hard you've studied. Today is the most stressful time, so apart from your own hard work, other people should help where they can. Lee Su Woon reports. Parents should watch their words today. Words like "You shouldn't repeat another year" or "I have faith in you" might be meant as encouragement, but can cause pressure on students. – Hwang Hyun Ha. – Yes. – Anyang Women's High School. – Anyang... Oh! – Why? Do you live near there? – Yes. That's good. Not many students are going there, but you are because you chose Spanish. – You don't need to write it down. – I don't need to? – No. – Thank you. Good luck. Don't forget the instructions. – Take one and read it once. – Thank you. 015. – Right. We have to do well on the exam. – Let's call the spirits together. – Yesterday, my classmates were crying. – Really? Mine never cry. My classmates are close to each other. People say it's true. They say we will reap what we have sown. I want to do better than last year. – What? – Are you that nervous? I'm not that nervous, but... I'm just anxious. We'll get through this. – Hello? – Hi, Mom. Minjun, it's going to be cold, so you'd better dress up warm and take a hot water bottle. The clothes you have, are they warm enough? – It's OK. I'll wear lots of layers. – Yes, wear lots of layers. If it's hot, you can take some off. Or you could wear the tights. The black long underwear from your dad. You better wear it inside first. It's warm underwear. It will be the coldest day in 16 years. It will be tremendously cold. – OK. –Yes, do that. Don't eat too many snacks. Have them tomorrow when you come back. You might end up with a stomach–ache. And don't forget to take the Herbalife as usual. Take that instead. And take a sleeping pill if you can't sleep. Minjun, you've worked really hard. You've done well. It will pay off. Do your best and be calm when you answer the questions. I will go to the temple tomorrow and pray for you. My son, you've done your best. I love you. Today, in 1200 sites all over the country, the Suneung exam will start at the same time. 650,700 students will take the exam, which is about 17,700 less than last year. Examinees and parents, you have suffered many hardships. Today is the day when all your efforts pay off. Fortunately it won't be cold today, but in some areas there will be some autumn rain mixed with fine dust. This year's Suneung will last from 8:40am until 5:00pm, and will be held in 1,257 exam centres. Near the 1,200 test sites, the police have prepared emergency transportation such as patrol cars and motorcycles. To prevent traffic jams, no vehicles will be allowed within 200 metres of the test sites. All examinees should have entered the exam centre by 8:10am. Identification slip? Pencil? – Do you have everything? – Yes, I have everything. Call me after the exam. Don't be too nervous. – You overslept. – Yes. I didn't sleep well. You didn't sleep well last night? In my dream, you and Mom were fighting. I had to calm you both down, so I didn't sleep well. There's only about an hour left. I hope the students will arrive early and give their all, after their intense preparations. If you think you will be late, you can dial 112 and get an escort to the test site. Today, public offices and businesses will open an hour later than usual. The government asked businesses to start work later and asked military camps to refrain from movement. Additionally, from 1:10pm to 1:40pm, when the English Listening exam takes place, all aeroplanes will be grounded to restrict the noise. The Ministry of Education has requested all buses and trains to slow down and refrain from honking. The registration time is about to end. As the start time approaches, everyone is getting nervous. I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster. Over here, over here. What are you doing? The examination centre is over there. Our news van is at the test site where the exam is about to start. Reporter Jungkyu Kang. As registration is about to end, there is an intense atmosphere at the test site. Less than ten minutes remain until the gates close. The examinees seem nervous and start walking faster. The motorcycle has departed. The motorcycle. Police, soldiers and bike couriers are everywhere. It's like a war zone. Do you have your identification paper? Look at it and find your room number. Do well on the exam! The 2014 Suneung exam has just started at over 1,200 test sites all over the country. For the next eight hours, students will be taking the exam. In the exam rooms, examinees have already started Korean, their first subject of the day. After the first exam, students will be given a 20 minute break. The math exam will start at 10:30am. After that, they will take English, followed by Social Studies or Science. Oh Gatbawi Buddha. These lovely children of Buddha who take the exam today believe in your great and amazing ability. In the Buddha's merciful arms as their studying becomes better every day, give them the ability to go to the schools where they want to go. By now, our children have taken two main subjects. Until 12:10pm they took Korean and Math, but they still have three other subjects to take. Now they've almost finished the listening exam. Since it is a noise–sensitive exam, planes have been grounded for 30 minutes. From 4:20pm examinees will take the final test, and that will be the very last step of this year's Suneung exam. Some students still have to take the second language test, but apart from them, all students will finish their journey and bear the fruit of 12 years studying and effort. Hello, everyone. My name is Kim Chul Hwoi. You worked very hard today. Right now, let's take a look at the questions and answers on the 2014 Suneung Korean exam. Let's take a look first at questions one to three. This question deals with a fictional business negotiation. The article depicts a fictional business negotiation between a company and the city government. Hello? Joon Yeong! I came home after the exam. I don't know. The answers haven't been released yet. I think I did well. And then what? Yes, all the exam takers in the country have worked really hard. Right now, you might feel relieved, but you might also be worried. Now that the exam is over, it's time to plan ahead. I hope you can make the right decision with the help of our analysis of this year's exam. – This is EBS News. – Thank you for watching. – It's pizza with a cheese crust. – Give me a small bit. – Dad, it's not that salty. – Hey, daughter. I'm not going to ask if you did well or not. Oh, really, you did well? Oh, you expect to get into Seoul National University? Not Yonsei or Korea? You will apply the normal way, won't you? Oh, really? After the exam, Hyein told me she wants to go to Megastudy. No, she didn't study hard enough to feel like she's free now. That's just the way it is. Hello, Minjun? So what level did you get in the two Social Studies exams? One is third level. If you have third, if we add up two, you should be able to get second level. – You can get it in Korean, right? – I'm not sure. You don't know exactly? Three subjects... Then you should be able to get first grade in Social Studies. – Then... – But I'm not sure about that either. You're not? Yesterday you said you'd get first level. I'm not sure about it now. If you can't get second level in Korean, then you don't meet any university requirements. I will go to any freaking university and then try again. I can't get into Korea University. I'll repeat again. Stop talking like that! You aren't making any sense. I won't ask you to help me again. That's not the point. It's just a waste of time. Do you really think your life will be so different if you go to university in Seoul? – That's what I think. – Ah, I'm going to go crazy. I don't know what I've done for one year. What have you done for one year? Mom, I don't want to come home and I don't want to see you. I just... Before the Suneung exam, we're just focused on studying. After the exam, it's a race to get into a better university with the same score. It's not just about doing well on the exam. There are experts on every single admission process. To figure out how to get into the best university with our results, we should consult an expert and pay at least 800 euro. I should study the different processes and should find out what type of student each university wants. I should pretend to be that type of student, since the real me can't get into my dream school. I think it's really messed up. – I want to go to SNUE. – What's your second choice? Kyung–ln University of Education. Or Choon–cheon University. – What about Chung–Ju? – CNUE... It's also on my list. So with these four, you should arrange them according to where you want to go most. If I ask myself where I really want to go, all I can think about is SNUE. The others are just... – But you still have to make a decision. – These aren't... What if you don't get into that university? Then you should pick one of these. Nobody can predict the final result. If I'm not accepted for SNUE this year, then I'll study for the Suneung again. I'll want to take the Suneung exam again. – But I don't want you to do that. – I'll apply again. She'll apply because it fits her career plans. I know what you mean, but I think that will be difficult. You will waste your youth if you repeat another year. I wanted to go to Hankuk University, but I didn't get through the first round of applications. So I applied for Korean Education at Ewha University. My Suneung scores are not good enough to apply the normal way. I probably couldn't even get into a university in the countryside. So I'll repeat the year. I think it could be a fun year. I won't have to go to high school any more. When I repeat, I can just focus on the Suneung exam. But my mom and dad keep telling me to stop talking nonsense. The money it costs is a big problem. We would have to pay between 2000 to 2500 euro per month. But I can earn some of that with a part–time job and my parents can pay the rest. I think I might really enjoy my repeating year. You have failed. Your whole world has turned dark. Desperation has come over you and you can't get rid of it. You went to the exam venue with a heavy heart. Finally the day came. You were afraid. Time went faster than you expected and became a huge pressure. You thought you were the only one with problems. You thought that you were alone. You were walking on the road to failure. All this... If it's your future... can you accept it? However... Teacher? How long will your lecture be? Around 30 minutes, but it could be shorter. Your allocated time is 26 minutes. – OK, then I will make it shorter. – 25 minutes, if possible. OK, I will make it short. Don't worry. He might have done his best. He suffered the most. It was harder for him than for us as parents. But why did you get this result? Why did you make us worry like this? It's all just a big disaster. Don't touch it if you're not going to eat it. What are you going to do now? What do you want for the future? I haven't decided yet, but just... Do you want to go to a good university? Or do you want to be a good student? I want to go to a good university. I don't think studying is as important as going to a good university. Why do you want to go to a good university? It's not my choice. All my life, society's pushed me to go to a good university. – What if you don't pass? – I'll have to repeat another year. – And what if you do pass? – If I pass? Even if I pass, I still want to repeat another year. You didn't study very hard, but you want to go to university. Last year was the same. This entire year, I've studied three times harder than all the years I was in high school. Then why you didn't study that hard for three years in public school? Actually, I didn't want to repeat another year. I thought one year of repeating would be enough. But now that I've taken the exam, I'm not satisfied with my score. When will you stop? Are you sure you can do it next year? Honestly, I'm not sure I can do it next year. I'm worried. Do your best, buster. Dad, I will do what I say. – I will go and buy books. – What? You threw away your books. Now you have to buy them again? Honestly, those books are only useful for one year. – He should buy different books. – Buy him books, then. – Then I'll just buy one book. – You think one book is enough? She wants to see you. Did she press the button? – Hello, Hyunha! – Aunt! Why is your video on? Results are released at 5:00pm. Will you know them earlier? – What did you say? – If the results are at 5:00pm... Yes, at 5:00pm. Tell your mother to text me your application number and your certificate number. I'm sitting in front of the computer, staring at the result page. When the results are out, I'll call you. Hey, for 30 minutes, just keep your eyes open. OK, I will. – Thank you for calling, Aunt. – I hope you pass! – What if I fail? – No, impossible. If you fail, then tomorrow we will be busy. What should I do if I fail? Manual labour? You and I will have to go out to work. My heart is beating really quickly. Should I check if the results are out? No, at 5:00pm. 5:00pm. Mom, do you have the tuition fees? Yes, don't worry. I won't go and work in a karaoke bar, but apart from that I will do anything for you. It's 5:00pm! Mom, should I press the button? Oh, I'm really scared. – It's exactly 5:00pm. – Yes, it is. It even says so on the mobile phone. Shall I press the button? – You have no choice. – I can't do it. It's scary. – Press it? – Yes, hurry up. Press the button. What's wrong with it? What's wrong? Hi, honey. You checked it already? We're trying now. I passed! Hyunha, you get accepted the normal way! Oh, well done! It's all over now. Well done. I picked the red flag. I expected this. – It's red. The letters are in red. – Yes, the acceptance is in red. Good job. Well done. Look at it again. Look at it! You should take a picture of it. "You are accepted." It's written in red. Dad! Dad, I passed! Oh, Hyunha, you did so well! Dad, come home early. Dad, thank you so much. – Hello. – Yes, you... congratulations! – Thank you. – You look good. You should do your best at university, because you get to do what you want. Really? You were accepted to Ewha University? Yes, they called me. Hyein, come over here. You should go to the other staffroom too. – Did you already tell the headteacher? – No, I didn't. – You should have. To get into Ewha Women's University with your score is a miracle. – It's a real miracle. – I was just lucky. On October 13th, at 10:00pm, I received a text message. "'We have announced the students who have passed the second round." I checked my results and saw that I'd been accepted. My teachers never thought that I'd get into a good university. Maybe all the other applicants didn't do as well on the interview as I did. Or maybe I was just better. Or maybe there wasn't anyone whose exam scores were good enough. Fortunately, I got accepted. That day I really felt like I was in a dream. – I was accepted to Seoul last year. – Oh, congratulations! You look more handsome than on the screen. I've learnt a lot from you, so I'm really grateful. Oh... I can feel your energy. I've decided to become an elementary school teacher. Before my repeating year, I studied because I felt good when I did better than others. I didn't know what my real dream was. I thought my dream was to get high scores. When we're small, people compliment us when we're smart. When I did well, I felt like my mother loved me more, my teachers liked me more and my friends respected me more. Such snobbery was my motivation to study. The biggest thing I've learned is the fundamental reason why I should study. Later, if I become a teacher, I want to be a teacher who doesn't let her students fall into routines. High school students should first figure out what they are studying for. Their dream shouldn't be just getting a high score. I want to help them find their dreams. My dear family, who have suffered for a year. The past year was a very precious year for me. I can't express this enough or do enough in return. I have grown through the experience of being separated from you. But as time passed and as I tried to endure the time, I realized something. Youth isn't really about playing or enjoying yourself. Enduring, being immersed in something, that's the true definition of youth. I will repay your kindness by studying really hard for the Suneung exam and doing well on it.
