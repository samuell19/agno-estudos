Can I sit here, buddy? Aren't you Calazans? What if I was? What's that to you? Well, someone informed me you sell guns. They informed wrong. My son, this gun is my own pet. And I'm not selling it for any money. Spill the beans, buddy I knew you got a good shipping of .38's From the US, crossed the border at Belém That's news to me. Never heard of it. So it is. I was told by Zé from Canaverde. You shouldn't trust this kind of talk. I've never had any tool but this one. I'll give you 10 for it right now. It's not for sale. This thing has taken me out of many tight situations. Let me see if it's really that good. Hey, brother! Hey, you there! Would you place a bottle on the table? Are you firing in here? Yeah, just to check if this is good. Careful with me! You need to check your aim, buddy. Huh? I missed a shot? Oh, I see it. The rifling is off. Nothing is off, brother. Wanna see? Take a look here. I can't see anything. Look real good. Don't you know me? I'm finding this strange. Nothing strange here. May God take you! Haha! He died beautifully, like Zé da Flor. Who ever dies beautifully, man? Even the bravest shit their pants when their time comes. - I don't think so - Why? Some folks even die with their eyes open. They get to see the angels singing. Have you ever seen someone being buried alive? Yup. Gave me the creeps. I couldn't get the nerve to go on. When I saw the two poor souls twitching and Pedro Biela jumping on top of them to throw dirt I'm not ashamed. I got the hell out. Who was in the hole? Colonel Lulu's son and his cowboy. The old man shit himself while digging the grave. I've never seen such hatred as the one between those two families. Everyone finished off by bullets. I was hired to kill for one side, Tonico das Alagoas killing for the other. In the end there was no one left to pay me for the last murder. Rufino, Pedrão wants to talk to you. Already leaving? Now that I started? Play for me. What's up Pedrão? Pull a chair, boy. Who's the fox? Jacaré's lady. He got 30 years and she's free for the taking. And you're really taking it, aren't you Pedrão? Watch yourself, boy. What are you up to? After Mr. Meco's job I've been free. Have you ever been to Bahia? Never. Someone there needs to go to heaven. Would you be so kind? You visit Bahia, earn 200, pay an oath to Saint Senhor do Bonfim. Holy Saint! - Who's the corpse to be? - A certain Pinto Borges. You'll meet him in St. Francis' church. Bahia's most well known place. In a requiem mass. Hm. What does he look like? Here's a portrait. This is a letter to the owner of the place you'll stay at. Here's half the money. The rest will come after the deed is done. Poor man. Does he have a family? Hey daddy! Excuse me. Colonel Domingos called to say he's not coming. What can I do? He seems to want a fight. He's playing you. More than 100.000 votes. He also owns the most farms around here. After old Sebastião died, they lost touch. True. Domingos didn't show up. The old man's death was dumb. It looks like he suspects Pinto Borges I think they even had a fight. Lucy? His daughter? She's modernized now. She can even drive! I wish you could see her when she arrived. A fancy dress and a ribbon on her hair Her late mother would never approve Oh darlings, this is becoming a gossipers nest! Excuse me. It's time. I'm going. Silence! Silence! Ladies and gentlemen Colonel Pinto Borges Your friends put me in charge of the honor to salute you. I want to pay homage to this politician of 400 years. A foundation of our party that in the region of São Francisco river Works feverishly towards the humble man. No sacrifice is too heavy to make every citizen more sure of his future. Pinto Borges is a flagship. A name that imposes itself 17 reservoirs built in a year 12 hospitals 29 health units and 25 schools. Pinto Borges, this tribute should be payed in a public square so the people would know from now on that you're launching your candidacy for State Governor Congrats, honey. Daughter of the future State Governor. I'm sure your palace parties will burn millions. Millions! But after the fame, please don't forget your social columnist. Lucy, do you know who is here? Who? Congressman Ciro. I've heard he's your father's political enemy. - What's he doing here? - I have no idea In politics everything is possible. Maybe he came to see the party host's daughter? If it's the case he's mistaken, I don't want anything with politicians In my family, my father is enough Excuse me, Dani, come here. Let me introduce a friend. OK! I'll be right back, Lucy Haven't I said that Pinto Borges vouches for it? But it's very risky. They told me... ...that one in each 10 cans is spoiled I know, but no one is eating spoiled food. Whoever buys them will open the cans, and dump the spoiled ones. If anything happens, you won't be blamed Pinto Borges told me to talk to you. The food company is giving 500 thousand cruzeiros to whoever clears the delivery. I don't know, this is dangerous. Don't be stupid, get the money! Sign the papers, you're not fixing what's already crooked. And what if I don't sign? Pinto Borges will arrange an immediate transfer to Acre. Where you'll take care of indians diseases. I think I'll displease Pinto Borges Want some advice? Don't. You'll end up begging for coins at the cathedral's doorstep Oh, you here? That makes me think the state's politics are going through some radical changes - ...right? - Absolutely wrong. So maybe there's a certain young lady with a nice inheritance ...on the sights of the young, nice and brilliant congressman? You're still absolutely wrong, sir. In this year's most reserved party the presence of the young opposition congressman Sheer mystery. But I love mysteries! - It must be a new love affair. - Really? Domingos never knew anything. He didn't come here for some reason I guess he suspects something. Nonsense! When old Sebastião died he wasn't even here. But his people already know it wasn't a thief. So what? The man that did the job must be far away now. Relax, nothing will come out of this. I hope you're right. Despite not being invited You'll have the honor to be the last to leave, huh? Just a coincidence, Colonel. I didn't know you were throwing a party tonight and as I didn't want to spoil your occasion, I saved the bad news for last. And what bad news could a failed congressman bring? You won't support me in the next elections? Actually I don't think you'll be able to run. - Why? - Because until then... ...You shall be in prison, Colonel. How dare you! Leave my house! One moment, Colonel I was appointed by the inquiry commission in charge of investigation the buildings that crumbled during the last flood Here's an order to come before the commission to be questioned. Good evening, Colonel. By the way, your party has been very pleasant. Thank you, buddy. Bring me the change afterwards, OK Clarice? I want to speak with Madam Filó. What's your story, Northeastern? Oh, you got a letter from your men? Respect the visitors, you damn drunk. You don't respect me. Getting letters from your men in front of me. Never mind this trash, let's talk over there. So how's Pedrão? Still a womanizer? Pedrão is all right. He sent me here to... I know, you're staying here at the hostel Hey Clarice. Bring the gentleman some coffee ...and tell Tomás to come here. Madam Filó, I was showering upstairs and the water stopped, what now? What do you want me to do? Lick you to remove the soap? Go finish your shower in the back. Shameless woman. Never mind that, gentleman. That's how things are here. I gotta solve everything - Hey Tomás! - What is it, Madam Filó? Take Mr. Rufino's suitcases upstairs in Ana Paula and Alicinha's bedroom. Don't you dare disrespect him, OK? That's the room, gentleman. Thank you. Are you sick, girl? No, leave me alone. Is this about money? Would you please leave my room? I can't see you right now, I'm unwell. It's not about that, lady. I want to know if I can help you with anything. The cop that brought me here also wanted to help. Just leave, please. Leave! Have you never seen a naked woman before, donkey face? Why don't you go watch your mother? I'm telling Madam Filó, shit face! This won't do! If you want to look at me naked, you have to pay! Imagine that, a man climbing there to see me naked Filó! Hey Filó! I won't leave it like that. - Filó! - Woman, what's all that shouting about? You'll see shouting when I kick the ass of that asshole you're hosting next to my room - What did he do? - Climbed the wardrobe to see me naked! Is that it? I thought he was killing you or something. Look Filó, you either kick him out of there or I'm leaving. Who are you to talk to me like that? Like hell you're leaving. How can you leave if you don't pay what you owe me? I'll fix that, I'm switching his room with Alicinha's OK? That's it, Filó, if she doesn't want to be next to a pervert, put her next to a saint! Oh yeah? Why don't you go mind your own business? Don't push me bitch! Stop that or I'm calling Godfather to solve this situation! - What's going on? - Get out of my face! I'm leaving this house right now! I'm solving this. Come in, girl. This is a workplace. You're not going in the streets to look for men. Relax and sit down. What's the matter? Listen, Godfather, don't trust her. Luciano, I'm glad you arrived to sort this woman's situation Filó, in order to prevent any misunderstanding my affair with this man is already over What's that, are you jealous of that little girl? I'm not, you can have her. Haven't you brought her here? Oh, now it's a married couple fight. For God's sake, Luciano, get this over with. Sorry, Filó. This woman started getting jealous as she got old. Old is your mother, you disgusting cop. - Get hell out of here, you tramp! - Relax, Luciano, leave it This woman is getting too upset. What's new? What is your deal? Something I got in the street, brought it in to make money. - Will it cause trouble? - No, it's registered - All right then - How's the girl doing? Not well, the stupid girl won't leave the room and won't come down when it's time to work. Until now she didn't make a dime. To be honest, she owes me 2 days of rent. Let's hang on for a few more days. If she keeps like that I'll take care of it. The pest still thinks someone will help her. She was sleeping in the streets. I bring her here, make her comfortable and then she doesn't want to work? They're so ungrateful. Hey, neighbor! I'm sorry I saw you naked. It was an accident. I thought that something had happened to you. Are you still mad at me? Please don't, I'm just a humble man meaning well. Good morning. I'm really sorry for what happened yesterday. Can I sit? If you want to. What made you act like that? I was sick of that farce. And who wasn't? But there's a difference in the reactions of each one to the consequences. Come on congressman Ciro, the reasons and consequences don't matter. What matters is the attitude. The desired action in the desired moment. Your philosophy is fake. A man cannot detach from the past nor the future. Apart from that, your attitude was not spontaneous. You're right. There are always reasons. Forgive me It doesn't matter But this might interest you even professionally. The audience deserves special attention from the clowns. Why won't you face reality, Lucy? I don't need your advice. All right, all right. Look, Ciro, I'm disillusioned with everything and everyone. Also with men? Oh? Are you interested? Body or soul? Both. But it seems no one exists to you. Not at all! Lucy Borges, the ocean, the sun... I won't take that attitude into consideration, Lucy Because I understand you're deeply hurt and disillusioned and despair won't solve anyone's problems. You need to fight. Don Quixote... Maybe, but one in an army of Quixotes. Madam Filó is hopeless. In a women's house she decides to host a man. A silent, weird type. I imagine he caused all that fuss this morning. So, girl? Bed, company, entertainment... What else do you want? You gotta earn your living, girl. But that's not the kind of work I expected. Offer myself to the men for money. Do you want me to support you? So afterwards you find yourself a man and bail out? Or do you want to be a maid doing dishes for the rich? Filó, if in 3 days she doesn't pay you let me know that I'll solve this But I just want to leave! You pay what you owe me then leave. No one is holding you. But I don't have the money, or I'd pay You don't have it because you don't want, the house is packed with men. That's all she knows how to do, cry. That's what you get, looking stupid. Leave the girl alone, you disgusting cop. Why don't you bring your sister here to get all this easy money? - Who called you into this, you... - Hands off her! What the hell? This is a respectful house! Respectful my ass, there's only trash women here. The only thing I respect here is you, Filó. Yeah, thank you so much. Hey buddy, leave the woman alone, fighting is not worth it. No woman will take me for a fool! They're dumped all over the place, I house and feed them. You never gave any woman housing or food. You bring them here to take the money they make by seeing men. [indistinct shouting] Now we got that crowd fighting everyday in this dump. It scares the men away, right? And we, innocent bystanders, end up losing. That's right. I'm moving to another hostel. I shouldn't live with this kind of people. What's this? Don't cry. Just let it go. Your father may not allow me to see you again. Maybe it's going to be the opposite. He might use me against you in the future. You know, he will make an offer and try to buy you. You're exaggerating, Lucy. I don't think Pinto Borges is a great politician but I can't judge him as a man or as a father. Ciro, my father is a politician above anything else. So it won't be as easy as you may think. It's a shame he belongs to that group the old mindset that still exists in Brazil. The politics of taking advantage, abusing power. A fake idea of what it means to serve the people or a cause. I'm tired, I'd like to not think. But I keep telling you: You're an idealist, you'll suffer the consequences. It's not idealism, Lucy. It's a new generation that demands something better In search of what's possible. These are just words, I prefer action. In that case you'll fight on our side. Why do you insist in making me believe that your political ideals are sincere? Because I need you by my side. And I won't demand that you offer that out of the blue. I see. I know you're deeply hurt and disillusioned. But I don't know if that stops you from understanding love. What are we, after all? Be yourself. Be a woman in equal conditions and that will be enough. No, it won't be enough, we're still subject to the conventions. Not conventions, laws that structure society. Let's try and preserve them, not destroy them. Think that this is not a fantasy fight like you suggested and it will become clear. - Your fight. - Not my fight. I'm not worth anything, no one is. This is bigger than me, than you, your father... He's just a cog in the machinery I want to show you. Just a cog to you to me, he's my dad, do you understand? His and his friends' time has passed. A new mentality is rocking the nation. - Let's not talk about that any more - No, I want you to talk I like listening to you. I like how firm and decisive you are. Never mind what I say I'm nothing but a fool Lucy... What's up? Not feeling well? It's nothing. Everyone keep quiet, if you try to flee you'll be in a grave. Good morning, sheriff. I brought these men from the other village, their sheriff asked to transfer them here. The jail there is too crowded, there's no more room Ha! Take a look there! My cell is for 10 men, I got more than 40. There's no way. You'll have to find another place. Do you think I came straight to here? I've been to 10 cities and they're all crowded. Just keep following the road there's a city 26 miles away they might have room there. Do you think I'm traveling 26 miles to hear the same horseshit? I know what I'm doing with these men. See you later, sheriff. See you. Just follow the road to Irujuba. Go as fast as the truck will go. I'll travel on the back. Everyone sit down! I also want to ride the truck! On your feet, gang. On your feet, I told you! Everyone will jump from the truck. If you survive, congrats. If you stay, I'm shooting you. Come on! Jump! Jump! Jump, fellows, or you'll hear this gun singing. Don't jump Rufino, he doesn't have the guts to shoot! Oh I don't? Here you go! Rogério! My brother! My brother! Rogério... What happened to you? I'm feeling better already. Can we go outside? It's stuffy in here. What happened? While passed out you were doing fearful movements Talking about a certain Rogério I think I dreamed about my brother's death. The worst thing that has ever happened to me. Poor thing. How my northeastern suffers. That's why I joined this life. What life? What is it you do that's so bad? One day you'll know. Are you keeping secrets from your Paulinha? OK, if you don't want to tell don't tell. I won't get angry. Let's go home. Oh, Ana Paula is here. Ana Paula, I though you'd take longer. I have a favor to ask. Don't go to your room right now, I lent it to a couple. Oh, come on! How can you do something like that? - Is it because I owe you? - Nothing like that, pretty thing. You know you have the best room in the house. And we have a guest that's a very important man. I was ashamed to send him to the girl's filthy room. That's absurd! I don't care how important he is, I want my room! Come on, are you making a fuss for that reason? Just sleep over mine. What's that, northeastern? Are you trying to make a pass at me? No, I'm just trying to be a gentleman. Let's go! That northeastern is making me soft... I'm falling in love. There she goes, so full of herself all over the northeastern. I'm sorry for her That woman has really fallen. Shut up, you gossipers, leave her alone. You people should be more united. Yeah... Lack of union, filthy rooms. Only because she doesn't get the rooms cleaned for a month! Shut up, girl, it's nothing like that. I just said that to try and calm down that woman, she's too mad. I'm afraid... Isn't this crap going to fall down? You can relax, in this hammock two can lay down ...and three will wake up. You have a deal, Domingos. I accept it. So you build 4 reservoirs to irrigate our lands And you'll have 50 thousand votes at your disposal. The 50 thousand votes are not what makes me happy but rather the collaboration I'm getting with your people. After old Sebastião died I got the impression you wanted to pick a fight with me. Do you understand, Borges? There was, and still is, a suspicion. The old man was murdered. They say it was a thief but nobody knows for sure. It's a good thing I have nothing to do with that. But back to our topic you're aware that when we build the reservoirs the roulette in the Northeast will start spinning. The lucky ones will get irrigation And the others? Well... their lands will either become marshes or will be under water. That's how it is. You can't serve everybody every time. On the other hand, you wouldn't build reservoirs to irrigate your political enemies lands. You know, Domingos, that inquiry committee is worrying me. The opposition assholes that don't have the voting power to fight me are trying everything to take me off the race That disloyal, dirty politics is just like a war, you see, Borges? That's what delays the progress of our country I wonder if your father is at home? Why, are you afraid? No, it's not about being afraid. He might want to cause trouble. I consider myself an independent woman. I can have the friendships I want even if they are my father's enemies. Well, let's go then. Look Domingos, It's that idiot that's blocking me at the chamber. Whoa, Borges, how dare he comes here with your daughter? Go figure. My noble adversary? Come closer! Come drink whiskey with us. I don't get it. Head inside, this will become a mess. My dear congressman, have you met Colonel Domingos Mendonça? I just knew the name. Is he also on your black list? It's not a black list it's just an inquiry that's running normally based on some reports. Based on reports, see? And is it possible to know who exactly made those reports? Just be patient, you'll know soon. Gentlemen, excuse me. Ciro, come here. I need to talk to you. Colonel, don't you think this is not the right moment to address such unpleasant matters? Relax. The matter I want to talk about will interest us both. Although it's not political. Ah, Lucy? Exactly. I... I think it will be impossible to continue this friendship. I'm sorry to be frank, Colonel. But that depends exclusively on her. That's what you think. I still have complete control over her and it will only take one word for this to finish once and for all. I believe you're mistaken, Colonel. Your daughter has changed a lot lately. I know she likes you, Ciro. But it wouldn't be convenient for us to be on unfriendly terms. You could just solve that political issue and everything would be sorted out. Fraud and corruption can't be solved, Colonel. If you would have to go to jail neither me nor Lucy could change the reasons for that. Have a good one, Colonel. But Borges, are you going to stand that boy challenging you? I don't know. My daughter likes this crook. I don't know what I should do. But I do, Pinto Borges. I know what I'll do. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. What are you doing, son? Just looking at the church, Father. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Thing? Are you calling God's temple a thing, my son? Apologies, Father. I'm just ignorant. I'm not from here I came from the North. You admire the church in a rather strange position. Oh, don't mind me. I am a photographer, you know? I was picking the right angle to take a picture some other day. All right, my son. You have to go now. The church is closed until 4. The exit is through there. Whenever you want to take pictures, you may come. Our doors will be open. Thank you, Father. And you can be sure I'm coming to take the photos. May God be with you, son. Those northeasterners are strange. They carry a world of goodness inside them. The old man won't like this at all. Relax. My father can be a bad politician but he's still a good father. If he realizes politics and love are two separate things everything will be all right. It has to be all right. Whoa, if it wasn't for the brakes, huh? Poor man, it looks like he was in an accident. Let me see. Ciro I saw who was driving that car. It was my father's driver. I can't believe it. You should. I recognized him as they passed by. I'm taking you home. What church is that? It's the church of Santa Luzia. Why is it abandoned like this? No one there. A crime happened inside. It will be closed for 100 years. So that means São Francisco will close? São Francisco? What's going to happen to that church? Oh nothing, I was just wondering. Do all churches obey that law? Of course. It's an old Catholic law. Are you worried, my northeasterner? No, it's nothing. I just think it's too harsh a punishment. 100 years closed. Everything is a punishment. God seems to want to try us with so much punishment. You must have suffered so much. When we look around we just see misery everywhere. You know it had been a while since I last laughed. If only we had access to water, a lot of bad things wouldn't happen there. The drought is the end of all things and the beginning of our people's misery. That's not the only place where you find misery. Don't you see our lives? Doing anything just to have a place to eat and sleep. Let's join our misfortunes and see where that leads. And you, that came from the North what are you doing in Bahia? I came to deliver something to a poor soul here. But I can only deliver it on the scheduled day. Why? Is it a birthday gift? Sort of. Who are they? They must be very rich, right? The poor fellow who's receiving the delivery is called Pinto Borges. The one that sent it is a certain Colonel Domingos. The beating didn't work. And I suspect my daughter suspected something. She hasn't been home for 2 days. What, Borges? And that jerk Ciro sent me a subpoena scheduling the hearings for next week. Borges, do want to know something? I think that there's only one way to deal with a guy like that I've been thinking the same But with this inquiry it's dangerous for me to get under the spotlight - True - No doubt about it My dear Colonel Domingos, here? What's up? Colonel, I have a girl here for you 16 years old Just as you like them What's that, you scoundrel? I can get my own women when I feel the need Stop this foolishness, Colonel. I always got the girl for you. Luciano, you arrived at the right moment Come here, I need to talk... - Colonel Pinto Borges? - How are you? Luciano, I need an outsider to solve a case here. That beating didn't do anything. That man is hopeless. He's got to vanish. It wasn't the guys fault. There was a woman in the car, she got out with a gun shooting at everyone And you know, when there's a gun everybody runs. That's why I need an outsider, someone unknown and good. What's the pay? 200. Leave that to me. I'll check the scoundrels in Caxias. When do you need it? As soon as possible, it should be within this week Give me an advance I'll see that the gentleman will have a first-class job - When he arrives, let me know - OK - Bye - Bye Domingos, what was the deal? Leave it to me. He's going to be taken care of. I also received a subpoena yesterday. We're on the same boat. Who's the guy that hit you the other day? He's the bastard that took me from my house and put me in this life What's his deal? I don't know. He used to be a cop. He worked in this area. Now they kicked him out. Already going? Yes, I have to go. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing Have you done the job? Yes, that's why I have to leave soon. That was fast. How much? Don't worry. I'll fix that with Pedrão OK. So... See you later. God help you, Son. That must be Vilanegra. Check out his style. He looks like Nat King Cole. Vilanegra? "More or less". - I'm Luciano - How are you? Let's cut to the chase. I can't stay more than a week here. I've got other performances scheduled in Caxias. Have you got any luggage? Just my tools. I play the violin, caliber 38. Wait here, I'm letting the Colonel know. "All Right". These photos are not good. Don't you understand? We need pictures with more poverty. Sick children crying, starving, skinny people. But these are the ones they sent. I don't know if there's more. Then make them take more. These ones won't impress anyone. The drought committee has been quite demanding. This way we're not getting their money, understand? Manuel, leave for a bit, I have to talk to him. Luciano, come here, I have to talk to you. The man is here, Colonel. What's it gonna be? I've changed the plans. Before the main job, you'll look for a gunman that came from Alagoas, hired to kill a friend of mine. Do you know his name? No, I don't know his face either The only information I have is that he was going to stay at a certain Madam Filó place. Oh I got this. I know the place. It's my turf. Excellent, then. I need you to bring this man here one way or another. It's an urgent matter. I don't mind, Colonel, but maybe Vila won't like it. He was paid to do just one job. I think he'll complain. Yeah, I know how these things are. Bring me the man and I'll pay extra. You can bring him here or wherever I am. See you later. I would go to the police. I don't care if it is my father. But darling I'm not sure your father was behind that. But a beating is not a political case any more. Do you think you'll hurt me by reporting my father to the police? It's not your father nor his scum that worry me right now. It's you. Ciro, do you know what I think? - Ciro, I... - Darling, save that for later. Oh Ciro, I'll be honest with you. Your life is in danger. My dear, we're always in danger. In the streets, at work, at home. No, I'm serious! If my father ordered your beating, it's a warning Next time, he's killing you. I know how this things go. I've seen a lot of people in my family die because of politics You shouldn't worry so much. He just wanted to scare me so I'll stop the inquiry. You're a politician from the capital. You don't know how things are here. Here, they will kill for a single vote. You have no right to risk your life. It's too high a price. Your life belongs to me. I hope this great love won't make me a coward. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is already looking for you by now. You're a hottie. You must be amazing in bed. Depends on the money, darling. If the pay is high, you have to roll with it or else the client will complain. Don't be like that, your daddy looks should be worth something, right? If that's the one, he's gone. Left in a hurry. But I reckon he was with Ana Paula. He was. But it seems like he wasn't up to it and ran away. What about her? Is she in her room? Also left. And took the girl you brought with her. - She left? - Yup. She got some inheritance, paid her and Alicinha's bill, then they left. Inheritance my ass. Can't you see, Filó? He didn't leave with her to disguise it. What is it, Filó? Do you know where they've gone to? No. I don't! Come on, Filó. Talk to me, I've always been your friend I don't know, son. If I knew I'd tell you. What is this, Filó? Playing tough with me? Come on, Luciano, I don't know anything. Stop that bullshit. If you don't talk I'm wrecking you - Let me go, you idiot - Speak! You want to find the man, be a man and go look for him. I don't know anything. Leave the old lady. This girl told me that the woman that left with them - ...has a house at Escada. - You idiot! Stop this violence. Talking leads to understanding, right my dear? Bye You brat, get out of my house, bitch! Shut up, Filó, or I'll wreck whatever is left of your face! You'll wreck nothing, you're an idiot I'm calling Dadinho. Call whoever! I'll break you apart, you little woman! "The friends and relatives of Colonel Sebastião Veloso..." "...invite the fellows of the deceased to the 30th day requiem mass..." "...to be celebrated tomorrow, at the São Francisco church..." "...and thank in advance those who attend this Christian piety act" "Commissioned by Pinto Borges" Rufino yesterday when I was unpacking your luggage, I found a gun and a man's portrait. Tell me the truth. I want to hear it from you. - Madam Filó told me... - That I was a gunman That I came here to kill a man. Is that what she said? Yes And do you want to be the woman of someone who kill others for money? You're not evil, Rufino. I just know that. But why kill others? Did this man you're about to kill do anything to you? No. He did nothing. This colonel payed me to kill him. So give it up, Rufino. There's still time. Let's catch a train and leave to a place where no one knows you. It's hard. Killing is the only thing I know how to do. That has been my life since I was young. I've suffered too much. I raised myself hating on everybody. Since the day they killed my brother in front of me I couldn't do anything else. Always running, always running always killing. But it doesn't have to be that way Life is not a bed of roses But there are still a lot of good people in the world. Come on, you stubborn, speak up! Where is he? Tell me or I'll break every bone of yours. I don't know, he left with Ana Paula. Where to? Say it, girl, where did he go? I don't know! You don't know... You're all the same! On your feet, little thing Have you never been hit by a man? - Come here - No, I don't want to! You don't want to tell me where he is? Is he your man too? Am I not your man any more? No, no! Hey, Bahia guy. Now is not the time. But you need to believe in someone. You can't live this way, hating everyone. Believe in who? The politician I'm about to kill? The man built a reservoir. A hope to so many people. And now it's falling apart. It was made of sand. Believe in the Colonel that hired me to do the job? And now is ready to deny he's behind the order? It's likely he'll send another gunman after me. No. It's not this people you should believe in but life itself, in the simple people like us that deep inside don't mean anybody harm. We are what we are because of this world. The world is wrong. And who makes this world? Good people? Huh! Does that even exist? No! No! [inaudible muttering] I don't have the strength to start over. Not even with me? You might be the only good thing I've ever had. I'm afraid I'll lose you any minute now. You won't lose me. I'm also a failure. I knew that what I did was wrong. But it was the only way to get money and I needed to eat. Why didn't you look for a job? Luciano never allowed that. He thought I wasn't good at anything else. We are all wrong. The world is also wrong. If my job is to kill people that I don't even know that's because there are people that pay me for that. I've only ever killed one man out of my own will my brother's killer. It was pure revenge, I know. But if you were there, you'd see I was right. I don't see any reason to kill others. Not even avenging your brother. And I don't see any reason to sell your body. Not even if you're hungry. Mrs. Paula! It's the neighbor. Something must have happened. Rufino! Luciano was home escorted by a black man They beat up the girl, asked where you were, she didn't tell And then... Then what did he do? No! Don't go, he must be hiding there, don't go! That's what they want. Catch a train and leave. Come back afterwards and then we leave to someplace far away. That's what I'm going to do. Pinto Borges already knows I'm after him. He has already put someone after me. Take the girl away from here, I'll finish that scum off. And what time are you coming back tomorrow? No, I'm not coming back tomorrow. I'll keep hiding for a day. I'll pass by here the day after in the Juazeiro train at noon. You wait for me in the station, I won't even get off. Let's go explore this world! And are you really going to kill the man? I have to. There's no other way, I have already prayed for his soul Especially after what they did to the girl. He might as well buy his casket. Is this one good? Great. Send this one and those other two that I've picked - Send them straight to the cemetery - On it But Borges, is it possible that you... still insist on going to the São Francisco mass? Frankly I don't see why you need to do this. Going to the cemetery would be enough. After all, old Sebastião was a political enemy of yours. But this doesn't matter. On the contrary, death unites us all. I want to prove that I don't hold any grudges. Well, I can relate to that to a certain point. But I don't believe you'll feel fine at the mass. - Why? - Borges, there's something you should know A lot of people feel hatred for you. Baloney. I have no enemies. I just have friends like you that care for my well-being But that's why I want to help you... ...avoid unnecessary situations. Do you get it now? Hahaha, you're so worried. You sound like I'll die of heartbreak in the church. Forget about that. Now that my candidacy has been launched, I am a public figure. I have to go everywhere, even against my own will. 3.000 cruzeiros, sir. Thank you. Yeah, I don't know. I think this mass will change the whole state political outlook. People of all kinds will be there. You worry too much. Let's go. Forget about that. My God, that gave him an eternal life in Heaven May He forgive your sins redeeming your soul giving His Kingdom of Glory. May God forgive me, absolve me deliver me from evil. Don't let me fall into temptation. Redeem my sins, Give me the holy peace, amen "A crime happened inside" "It will stay closed for 100 years" "Of course, it's an old law in the Catholic church" Domingos, have you told the guys we're going to the cemetery after this? Yes, Borges, they're aware Thank you, Lord. - To the cemetery - Which one? Where the rich people rest. - How are you colonel? - Hello, how are you? - That was a beautiful elegy, Domingos - Yes, it was Do you think I should give my speech right here? No, here won't be good, Do it in the cemetery, it's better - Why? - Let's go outside, it's too hot in here Nothing to do here, looks like Pedrão fixed it. See me tomorrow - Everything OK? - Fine Hey buddy, wait for me here. It may take a while - Wait and I'll give you a good tip - You got it "Here Lies Antonio Ladislau" "...lies" "...deceased..." "Here lies" "Here rests in peace" Dear friends and relatives of the late Colonel Sebastião Veloso. The homage we pay today On the 30th day after his passing "Means nothing compared to his goodness and honesty as a public figure" "Sebastião Veloso didn't die" "he's alive in our hearts." "His name is a flagship of political and human integrity." His deeds eased the problems of thousands of people. His verified charity was immense. Although I've been his political enemy today I'd give my own life to see him before the great works he created. "Sebastião Veloso, that I always fought in life..." "Today, before his death, I pay a sincere tribute" Wait! You don't need to kill the man I was the one who hired you in Alagoas You're getting your money now and go away There's no way. I prayed for his soul. Now it's on me Get away if you don't want to join him Are you crazy? The man must not die, I have already told you, I'm paying you now Out of my way! Borges, careful, this man will kill you! "Rest in Peace Pinto Borges" Falsehood is a serious business. They've killed old Borges and nobody knows who ordered it. They'll never find out who it was. In a short while the whole country will know. I got your message, what's up? They've killed the old man? In the cemetery. I couldn't prevent it. I managed to talk to him but the bastard didn't take heed and fired. Go look for him. - Do you know where he is? - No. Looking for an unknown man in such a big city is impossible. I know, but didn't you say he's got a lover that used to be yours? Go after her and wait until he shows up. And when he does, finish him, Luciano. That's what I'll do. Right away. Excuse me, gentleman. You're welcome. Thanks. My next trip will be to Conquista. I'm sorry for what happened, my condolences Sure, the gunman got the glory. He got ahead of you in destroying my father. Your father destroyed himself. It's a vicious circle. And you know what he was entangled with better than anyone. And you're on the same path. Give up this fight, Ciro. Look at what happened to my father. Leave politics, go do anything else. You're asking for the impossible, Lucy What I'm doing is not just mine, it's part of a wave of consciousness that is rocking the nation Even if I die, the idea will linger. End the scourge of political corruption 3 tickets for Juazeiro Listen, for how long does this train stop at Escada? One minute. Tell me where he is! We'll see if you don't tell me now, bitch. Hey Bahia, your type of woman is really tough, huh. Both of them were mine, they won't talk just to spite me. Let's wait here until the man shows up. There she goes! He must be arriving. She's warning him at the station. Let's see. I think he's on the Juazeiro train. And now, what should we do? I don't know him either. Whoever she sees must be Rufino. Ana Paula! Ana Paula! Where's the man, she can't find him. Ana Paula! Ana Paula! I'm here! That's the one! No, no, no! One is gone. Who's next? - A congressman from the city, let's go - OK THE END
