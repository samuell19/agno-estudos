Now, be careful. Huh. "War of the God Monsters" I have your next assignment. You are to approach Dr. Kim by any means. Rumor is that he was on to a big story. Dr. Kim? Have your already forgotten the veteran social ministry official? How could I? The stubborn and controversial biology authority. A much deserved criticism of the man. Now then. Prehistoric Dinosaur Resurrection. Isn't that what Dr. Kim Jin-young was claiming before he went into hiding? Hmm.... yes. His theories are a bit over the top. I found his hideout. So heavy. Gosh. Is this seat taken? Rude. Excuse me then. Oh, oh, oh! What happened? Watch your driving! Who are you? Oh, aren't you pretty. Is this Dr Kim's home? No. My dad is not a doctor. Huh? Really. But who are you? Well I'm... Huh? Dad! Dad! Uh, yes. Sohee. Did you have fun playing? Huh. Who are you looking for? Dr. Kim. You came to the wrong place. There's no one here by that name Now, Sohee, let's go in. Hmmm.. Dad, I didn't tell her this was Dr. Kim's house. Good job, dad? Yes, well done. You did a good job, my Sohee. Hello, is this your house? Yes, I live here. And you are? I am a housekeeper sent by Dr. Lee at the hospital. Uh, yes. I'm sorry, but the position has been filled. Dad. When is the housekeeper coming? Shouldn't be much longer. Dad, I was bored alone today. Didn't I tell you not to open this library door without permission?! Sohee. Sohee. Sohee. Dad. You hate me. Sohee. Here. Come here.... now. Come to Dad. Dad. Dad. Sohee. Do you miss your mom? Yes. So-hee, dad was wrong. Huh? Who is it? Uh? This isn't your house. Get out! I am a housekeeper sent by Dr. Lee at the hospital. Oh, you're the housekeeper. Dad! The maid is here! Come in. Come on, hurry up. Okay. Uh. Dad, the hospital sent her. I am Kang Ok-hee. Why didn't you say so earlier? Uh. Sohee and I are the only family here. Please. There are a few rules. Never enter this library without my permission. And if asks for me, you never heard my name. Yes sir. Hello? Yes, this is Sohee. Dad, it's the hospital. Hurry up. Got your nose. Yes, hello? Oh, well, thank you for sending the maid. I thought you could use some help. You have your hands full these days. Now take some time to relax, got it? Ok. I will do my best. Good-bye. Tea? Sister. Okay. Dad, try your coffee. Come on. Hush, hush. Huh? These are the shells pieces of a giant egg. This was definitely a dinosaur. Why don't you believe in my theory? Why? Why don't you believe in my theory? Even though there are signs one after another of catastrophe that will strike mankind? The world only accuses me of being crazy! Why am I crazy? Why? Why am I crazy? Why! Why do you say I am crazy? Why. Sohee, let me buy you a new doll. Let's throw this away. No, I like my doll. Ok, fine, I won't take it. Sister, when is dad coming home? He will be home tomorrow. Sohee, where is your mother? What is it Sohee? What are you doing there? My mom went to America. Dad said so. But I know that's not true. I know what really happened. Dad is lying. My mom is dead. No, wait Sohee. Sister, don't tell Dad I know. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Is that a dinosaur bone? Uh? This study of mine. It is proof a disaster is coming. We are seeing fish, frozen in the pond by winter, coming back to life in the spring. If so... Increased carbon emissions in the the atmosphere due to the accelerated development of civilization is causing many arctic ice walls to melt. Prehistoric dinosaurs have been hibernating in these ice walls and could wake up. Gosh. Uh? This is it. It must be the bones of a prehistoric dinosaur. If these were the bones of a dinosaur that died thousands of years ago, fossils would have formed. Did this dinosaur live and die recently? That is what I hope to prove. This was a haven for migratory birds There is currently no migratory bird found here. Itâ€™s the same as before. It's time to fish, but the fish are all gone. What is the damn sea doing? There is no Goby. There is nothing. I... I am sure that dinosaurs have awoken here. That's it. Sister! Sohee, where have you been? Sister was looking for you. Dad told you not to go into the library. I have to tell Dad. Then I'll have to tell Dad you talked about Mom. How about we keep each other's secret. Agreed? Now, promise. Ok. My sister is stupid. Agree. I'm sorry. Hey my Prehistoric friend, how are you doing? Uh, still trying? Yeah. Ugh. What's happening these days? I haven't caught a single Goby. Of course. Animals have an instinctual genius. Ants know an earthquake is coming three days in advance. 10 days for dogs and pigs. Migratory birds know a year ahead of time, did you know that? However, humans with their advance brains, have to see something to believe it. Dr. Kim, stop. You have that young beauty now. Go home and relax, and enjoy life. What young beauty? So many secrets, man. She chased away the housekeeper I sent you. Very pretty I hear. Huh? Uh? Dad! Yeah yeah. Sohee. Dad, sister was teaching me to dance. Oh was she? Sohee, can you go wait in your room? Yes, Dad. Uh, that's a good girl Sohee. Come in to my room. Yes. Huh? You read my theory. Yes. Who the hell are you? I'm a newspaper reporter. What? Reporter? Which newspaper company? I will sue you for theft! If you sue me, I will expose your theory. The catastrophe of mankind... how we are being punished for our sins? You know nothing, get out now! Isn't that what a thief does, runs away when he's done stealing? I came here to do a fair report. And what is fair coverage? Go before I throw you out! Now! It's your house, so if you want me to go, I'll go. Hello? Ohhh. My prehistoric friend! What can I do for you? Have you heard about any articles being written about me in the newspaper? I haven't. Why? Nevermind. Can you send the housekeeper back from the other day? Oh? What? The housekeeper? Man, do you think I'm running a job agency here? Send her up tomorrow please. Ok, goodbye. Dr. Kim. Somebody help me! Save me! There! What do you think you are doing? Mind your own business and get out of my way. Come here. Oh my goodness. Back off you hooligan! Gosh! Oh my, my head! Oh my. Gosh. Are you okay? Your sense of duty is honorable, but living out here in a tent is no place for a young woman. It would be safer for you to give up and go home. Wait. Thank you, but spare me your fake concern. What are you talking about? I am not an idiot. I don't know what you are talking about. Do whatever you want. Ha. Gosh. I'm sorry. What's the big idea? You hit me in the head! That hurt! It had to look real. I'll need this tent a few more days. Dad will you be back soon? Soon. The housekeeper is coming soon, so don't go outside. All right, Dad. That's my good girl Sohee. Goodbye. Ok, get inside. Dad, bye bye. Uh-huh. Who is that? Ahhh, there you older sister? This is cool. But what are you doing here, sister? Is Sohee mad at her sister? No, I'm not mad at my sister. I like my sister. And I like Sohee. Hey! Uh? So you don't really live here after all, do you? I'm sorry. That's all you have to say? Who is that sister? It's the new housekeeper. What? Consider me like an auntie. Or a step mother. Now, let's go in. No. I met your dad around the corner. He said to stay in, Sohee. Right? I hate her. Hate. Don't touch me. Hmmpff. Just a toy! How did she know it was me? What a treacherous woman. This is the smell of a beast. Uh? This is a fresh trail. It must have just passed! The direction of the foot is in towards land! A dinosaur has appeared! Take cover! Danger, sea dinosaurs have come to land! Run! Sohee! Sohee! Huh? What? Hey! wake up! Get up! Oh. Are you home now? Where is Sohee? Where is Sohee? Are you crazy? Gosh. Oh pretty. This is such a big egg. Really big egg. I have to let my dad know. Uh? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Sister! Oh? What's wrong? What is it Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? What's wrong? Hey! Dad. What is it Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? Sohee? What is that smell? It smells like sulfer? Dr. Kim's theory is a baseless hypothesis. This guy is crazy! Do you have any common sense? You really are crazy! Everyone needs to evacuate! Monsters have appeared, please evacuate quickly. Mom! Momma! Wow. Exciting! Uh? I'm sorry. Stop killing. Don't kill anymore! Sohee! Sohee! You had another nightmare! Sohee! Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! Sohee. Sohee passed out again after she woke from a nightmare. She will be okay. On the way she was delirious, saying she saw a monster. This young lady has been infected. She's probably hallucinating from the fever. Yeah? Outside of the house, did you see any more of those dinosaur bones? I fear she may have been exposed to them and that caused this infection. Even with his daughter in danger, Dr Kim can't see his nose in front of his face, how dangerous his obsession is. Human power, we will soon see how insignificant it is. Uh? Fortunately, the progress is good. Where is he with all of this going on? What happened to Sohee? Sohee, Sohee. It's Dad. She'll be okay. Sohee. It could have been a lot worse if it weren't for this girl, man. Thank you. You're welcome. Throw out all the bones in the house. No. Even if it endangers Sohee, you will continue to pursue your theories? Will you take care of your daughter? Or follow these foolish pursuits? Ahhh! Urgent breaking news along the 300,000 Pyeong guide line, Chilsung There was a mysterious ship sinking incident in the East Sea. I repeat. The latest news, along the 300,000 Pyeong guide line, Chilsung, an unexplained destruction and sinking in the East Sea... Guide lines there are equipped with the latest gear. They will investigate the cause. Then they will see the truth. Are you going to link this accident to your theory? Hey! This isn't a theory anymore. This is a sure sign of pending disaster! Trust me! Look at this, Dr. Kim. The prehistoric animal bones you have found. They could cause a viral outbreak. There was a caveman found in an ice wall! A man resurrected from the ice age! Oilfield was the dinosaur's home centuries ago. When they wake up, they will return to their home. Don't talk about your paranoid theories here! You should be worried about keeping Sohee safe! Sohee is very smart. Was she hallucinating? What did you see? Was it just the fever as Dr. Lee said? Good job, give me the papers. Thank you. Fire, fire! My car! My car! This, that, that, that, that, that, that... That... weird weird weird... monster? Is it a monster? Dr. Kim's theory must be true. Prehistoric dinosaurs. If this delusion continues I will order a check on your mental state. Why won't you believe me? Come with me. I will show you the footprints. Dr. Kim, what is wrong with you? Come in. I believe you now. As you theorized, Dr. Kim. The cataclysm has now begun. Huh? Uh huh, another person infected. The monsters have risen? Yes. What is this? What... how? I took it. At the beach. Sohee was not hallucinating. It will only get worse for us. How so? There is only one way to prevent reproduction. There must be an egg somewhere! I have to find it! Dad! Uh? So... Sohee! Sohee! Dad! Yes, it's dad. Are you okay? Sohee. Sohee. Dad. Huh. There are big eggs near the mountaintop behind our house. What? It's true, really. How can this be? Operation Archenemy. Take down these monsters. Roger! Get cover! Get cover! Run, hurry! Go! Help! Sohee, are you okay? Sister, they are like twins. Sister, the fire doesn't hurt them. Sister, how come they won't run away? It looks like we are now living in a prehistoric age. What does prehistoric age mean? Uh... well... let's hurry and find your Dad. Let's make a pass over the southwestern sea. Roger. Sohee! Sohee! Sohee! Sohee! No. Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! He was a good friend. Residents of the nearby coastal zone should evacuate to the mountain! What are you doing! Taking a nap?! A monster is coming, you need to evacuate quickly. Hey wait! I see! Oh my stuff! I need to pack. Oh no, how close is it? Oh no. We're in trouble! What is that woman doing? What's happening? I don't know. I do not know. Go, hurry up and evacuate! Hurry! Finally, let's go! Run! The monster reappeared and the plant is being evacuated! Warden, you must also evacuated! I can't leave! I will man my station until the end. Hey, are you crazy?! Sorry, but I must remain at post. Warden! That's an order! We are ruined! Fucked! My father! Where are you? Are you okay? Don't worry, dad will be coming soon! Sohee. Dad! Sohee! I have to find him. Where is my Dad? Where are you? Dad. Dad. Huh? Huh? Mister, why is Ajumma carrying a pillow? What? Pillow? Uh? Not this! Gosh! A pillow?! No? Look woman, look at what you are carrying! -A pillow? Where's your baby? -You foolish woman! Baby Dohoon! Dohoon! I've been hit! Dangerous jet stream generating. Emergency evacuation. Roger. It's a storm! Evacuate quickly! Dad! Sohee! Sohee! Help me out here! Help me out here! Sohee! Sister! Sohee! I think I'll be blown away! Sohee! Sister! Sohee! Sister! Just hang on, Sohee! You can do it! Sister! Sister is coming! Hang on! Sister! Dad! Mark the target! Blast those tanks! Sister? Wake up! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dr. Kim! Dad! Dad! Sohee! Sohee! Sohee! Dad! Uh? Dad! Sohee! Dad! Dr. Kim! Dr. Kim! Dad. Dad? Dad! Dad! Sohee! Let me down sister! Okay. Dad! Sohee! Is dad hurt? I am okay now. I couldn't have gotten back to you without my sister Dad! Dad? Huh? I wish my sister was my mother. Huh? Sister! Sister sit down! Uh? Why? Will you become Sohee's mother? Huh? Dad you must ask! Your theory was correct. The disaster is over for now. But I don't know when or where it will happen again. We will need to be better from now on.
