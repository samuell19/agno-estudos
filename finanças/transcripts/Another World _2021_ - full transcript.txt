ANOTHER WORLD So... She owns a first home with a living area of 130 square meters and a lot of 2,600 square meters, with an estimated value of ?700,000. A second home of 95 square meters, with one hectare of land, of an estimated value of ?550,000. Different bank accounts: a securities deposit with assets of ?35,674; a deposit account with assets of ?15,300; a current account with assets of ?12,000; a life insurance policy of ?201,624; for an overall value of ?264,598. The compensation claim takes into account the loss of career opportunities. My client and I have estimated that such compensation should amount to ?375,000. Unless... the duration of that loss of opportunity does not match the whole duration of marriage, since Madam has started working again since three years. On the first day of the wedding, my client's employment foreshadowed a very promising professional path. Madam sacrificed her career to follow Mr. Lemesle's in all his duties, in France and abroad. So she closed the door to her career. It was a real sacrifice. Today, at the time of their divorce, because that's what we're talking about, That choice has a price. Of course, of course, it has a price. I do not dispute the division of property, but I do not accept unfair treatment. ?375,000 is a lot of money, I feel drained... The amount is calculated on your current income... But I've been hearing from the beginning the word 'sacrifice'. Like I'm the villain here. - Nobody said that. - You insinuated it. That's the insinuation. There is no reason that I must lose more than you. I'm not saying otherwise. We are here to think about the future. Precisely. Mr. Lemesle has already accepted the divorce. If we talk about the future, we can not put the whole burden on him. He should not be penalized twice. The same thing goes for my client, Especially since her life has been hell for the last seven years. - Hell? - Yes, hell. In this case, excuse me, but... she should change her request. Don't ask for ?375,000. If it was hell, then ask for ?8,000,000. Please! Or even ?10,000,000! She told you that I made her life hell? Is this what she told you? Anne? Did I make your life hell? - Mr. Lemesle... - Please wait... Did I make your life hell? Answer me. - I suggest you avoid... - No, let me explain. No, I'm sorry, I can't allow this... Let's avoid the emotional road. I'll do that next, but now... I won't let you say that I made your life hell. No, I worked. They offered me responsibilities with an important company group, I accepted them and I had to work hard. It was a lot of work. A lot. - Yes or no? - Yes. Good... That brought money into the house. And you benefited from it as much as I did. You can't deny it. I don't deny it. Before accepting the job, we talked about it many times, and you knew exactly what awaited us. Sir, I guarantee you that my client recognizes it, but that's not the point. But you must understand that for seven years, since you took over the management of the plant, you brought your problems home. - This is the truth. - But this is not why we are here. The purpose of this meeting, sir, to discuss the divorce settlement. This is not family therapy. Neither it is the place nor the objective of this meeting. I agree, but I want to say one thing. I never said.... that accepting this job would be easy. I never said that. We have discussed this many times, I have never said that. But my client wasn't supposed to suffer for your career choice. That's not fair. Suffer? But she also enjoyed the benefits. - What you are saying is shameful. - How? I didn't sign up for you to bring your problems home. This was not the deal. You talked about more work. I said: "Ok, I'll manage my daily life despite your absence", but I didn't expect this chaos. She's berating me for my absence and for letting you manage your daily life? You were never really there. - That's not true. - Ah, yes? How many weekends we spent together in recent years? - I don't keep track of weekends. - I do. Six. Six in two years. Not even a night together. I'm talking about the last few years, but our family fell apart much earlier. You were constantly stressed... Sorry... What should I have done? I'm sorry, but I can't write off both my private life and my professional life. I will not lose on both fronts. I was very clear, I have never deceived you. I've never lied to you. I said it would be hard until the Elsonn Group had achieved its goals. So I depend on the Elsonn Group. I live with them. - I'm married to Elsonn! - I'm not saying that. I have suffered for years, listening only about tensions, anxieties and complaints about your work. Philippe, I'm almost 50! I have more years behind me than in front of me, isn't it so? I have done my share. The main question is not how to succeed, again cutting 10% of the workforce, in this context. Rather, it is how to deal with a contradiction that is, new cuts. A new economic plan in a context where the factory and the company are profitable, and also the Group, Philippe. A contradiction which will generate conflicts. You raise a question that the Group has not asked us to answer, nor to think about. But they ask us to do a job. We have the right to ask about... the consequences, we are not mere executors. The Group asks this, like it or not, so we have to do it. And I'll tell you right away: we will respond. To put things back in context, when Elsonn acquired us we were 603 men, today we are 508. We can make everything up, but... Alexandre, that's not what this is about. Spare us the story, we were all there, we know the numbers. It's not a history lesson but the numbers are important. We have to lay off 58 employees. That's not a little. Today I would just like to say: But no more layoffs in my department. You can look elsewhere, like in the communication area, where they seem a little more relaxed. - Sorry? - No, Sayid... - Can you specify? - Sayid, please. Sayid, wait. I don't want to hear this. We don't stab each other in the back.. - We're not going to do that. - I'm just saying... I just want to remind you that in the hyper-competitive sector, the production of parts for household appliances, you have to perform to the maximum and must be very competitive. If we want to continue to produce revenues and results, we shouldn't fire engineers anymore. I have no elbow room at all in my department. - We understood. - I hope so. Can I ask Alexandre to be more specific when he mentioned Communication? I say what everyone thinks. If we want to stay on track, I repeat it one last time: let's not stab each other in the back. And we don't tear each other down, clear? This looks like a repeat from two and a half years ago. You are doing exactly the same thing. The Group asks for a layoff plan and you start with the same song: 'If we are going to downsize departments, it will be chaos.' We move the administration to Poland, or another department to Portugal. There are solutions, other companies do it... Easy to say "we relocate". Stop, please, stop. We won't go in Julie's direction, I assure you. Not in that direction. I need to have the maximum of services on site. No relocation. But at least someone made a proposal. What I want: that you do proposals and find solutions. - Is that clear? - Philippe. - I just want to say one thing. - Say it. What I want to say is that Alexandre has perhaps the brightest engineers on earth... Don't tear it down. Say what you have to say without attacking others. We will do our part, we will do... the task that is required of us, but let it be clear: Communication won't do any more than the rest of my colleagues here. Great, because no one asked you that. - Then it's perfect. - I need solutions. If we had six months, I wouldn't worry. There would be no problems. But we don't have them. We have nine weeks, actually even less. It's eight weeks because I have asked about this since last week. I have a meeting with the general management, I need a report to present and I have nothing for them. In these eight weeks the message is simple: we work, we seek and we find solutions. And without leaks, because when the unions hear this, I tell you, it will be a disaster. Then it really gets chaotic. Hi, Lucas, it's dad. I saw you called me. Sorry, I was at work. You have to prepare for your exams, Call me back when you can. You know what I'm going to tell you. I read it... We are far from our goals. Are you aware of it? My answer is there, I have nothing else to offer you than my findings. So what do we do? I'm sorry but we will have to write something else, because I can't present your conclusions to the general management. I cannot. I cannot give... a distorted picture. This is a serious, coherent report from the figures, which seems to me to be consistent. I did my math... I can cut a few jobs here and there, but the number they ask, is impossible. This is not the first time they have asked for staff reductions, right? You usually have the answers. Why don't you have them now? - I can find solutions... - Good. ...but they would be wrong. They would jeopardize the well-being of our employees. Don't blackmail me with the employees' well-being. - It's not blackmail. - Yes, I don't want to go there. You know well that's not how I work. They ask me to give up 58 people and you give me 30. 30! - I can give you 200 if you want... - I don't want 200, I want 58. Seriously, Philippe, next time you go to Paris to talk to Mrs. Bonnet-Gu?rin, you should calmly explain to her what can and cannot be done in a company. If I have to sacrifice 58 people to save 500, then I sacrifice 58. Think you'll save 500? That won't happen, but you don't get that. You won't save them, because they will explode. I see them in my office every day. You mean the weakest. The weakest? Do you realize what you're saying? When they came to this company, they weren't vulnerable at all. They are weakened by the constant pressure which has been going on for years. They were perfectly competent people, who have always accepted every challenge. You work with them from morning to night. You know it well. - Olivier, stop. - You're losing your grip, Philippe. We have to be competitive, otherwise we are finished. But this is not feasible. Not realistic. Their demands are not realistic. You must think I can't make a decision. With the lawyers it's all a question of money. When they talk, I get the impression that it's not about us. We are left behind just because of the money. "I did this, you did that..." "Who has done more, who has done less..." I'm here, calm down. This is how these things happen. You'll think I'm only interested in money. Not at all. Come on I'm freaking out, you see? Because I don't know what will become of me. I feel useless, I'm ridiculous. You are not useless, you're not. We will find a way. - I don't give a damn about money. - I know it. You will say what you can afford and that's what it will be. I am so stupid. Come on, don't worry. I shouldn't have called you. I say one thing and do another. I'm sorry, I'm useless. It will pass. Sorry, I shouldn't have called you. It is ridiculous, it doesn't make any sense. No... It is so nice to have a date in a parking lot. I like it. We will announce the plan to the markets in six weeks. You have had enough time to refine your conclusions. I have read interesting angles, some are near-final proposals, others are a little less so, hence we have this meeting. Didier, do you want to start? It is a very ambitious plan. There will certainly be friction with the trade union once announced. Saying this, one of the big union leaders left the company. He retired last year. So we can do it. Ok. Christophe? I'm sorry to spoil the party a little, but we are asked to get better results with 10% less staff... It doesn't make any sense, it's impossible. 'Impossible'. I don't want to hear it. The British and the Poles are ready. They are not alarmed by this requirement. The Germans, as usual, want to prove they are the strongest. The Dutch will do their job, I know them. They manage, without complaining, staying on time, no problems, it will be perfect. And the Americans are already doing it. It is out of the question for France to emerge as the black sheep in this operation. Tell me, Claire, at the Las Vegas convention two months ago, when Mr. Cooper and the Board... highlighted the positive numbers of these last three years, you were there, you heard that. Now Cooper himself says that we can increase profits by two percent in a year? You know me, I'm not really a socialist, but what he asks of us clearly serves to increase shareholder dividends, at the expense of work quality at our factories. That is obvious. If you can fool the market, we are all ears. That is beyond my expertise. On the other hand, I would like for once to hear what the Americans tell us. As Cooper says: "Always think bigger than you are." Mrs. Bonnet-Gu?rin, may I have a moment? I would like to remind Mr. Garousse that outsourcing of the sector appliances is very competitive. - We can't play victims. - I'm not doing that. I'm just telling you that the cuts you ask us will be synonymous with difficulty for certain sites... I would say in all factories. And not only in France, even abroad. For me, in Strasbourg, for Philippe, for Denis and for you, Jean-Pierre. No offense, but you are speaking for yourself. We don't all share your opinion. If we don't take our responsibilities, if we don't do our job, if you don't, the responsibility will be ours, because it will be our fault, our lack of courage and intelligence. But maybe this is the scenario you want. TODAY is the day when YOU are THE KING HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD! Hi, daddy, I just woke up here, while in France you are already in the middle of the day. I wanted to tell you that I think about you a lot and I wish you all the best on your birthday. I guess you'll celebrate with your friends. I hope you're doing well. I send a lot of big kisses from across the Atlantic and big hugs for your birthday. Big kisses! Who allowed it? Who allowed it? Excuse me, sir, maybe it was the only way she could produce such quantities. I already said that safety is not a choice. Now I have to tell headquarters: "Hi, good news! Ms Evrard blocked the device's security and she lost her arm!" Do I have to tell them that? I'm just telling you how things are for us here everyday. Everyone knows those lines. They are programmed to produce a number of parts, incorporating safety breaks. Yes or no? And, Mrs. Storti, speaking clearly, did you see someone disable a security, and you did nothing? If there is an anomaly, I intervene immediately. Apparently not. You did not! I intervene when there is a risk! But I can't see everything. What Jacqueline has done was indeed wrong, but for many girls, and above all, for those of a certain age, the scheduled breaks are no longer... they are no longer enough. Sorry. I don't want to hear it. - They're too short. - I can't listen to this. I want to say something. I respect you, but you are not being honest. People work hard on those lines. They love their job and they do try their best to keep going. I do my best too. I also want it to go on. And as long as possible. A company is not made up of numbers, but of workers. - First of all, people. - Don't lecture me. You see it under your nose. I know my factory. It is not true, you do not come to the workshop. You are no longer seen. - It is false. - That's it. What are you waiting for? That people get exhausted? Someone kills himself? What are you waiting for? I want to reassure you about your son. He is resting. We'll keep him here with us for a few days to understand exactly what happened. He insulted his teacher. But not only that. He also threatened him with a compass, uttering insults. He spoke incoherently. Very confused. That's why we brought him here. He came to the emergency room where I examined him and as we talked, his anger subsided. That anger was mainly directed at that teacher, but really had nothing to do with him. There is mental fatigue, of course, there are things that his brain is unable to process. I think... it would be good if he could be at some clinic anywhere close to your home. Keep in mind that we don't know everything, we don't have the answers yet. We are not omnipotent. So we have to approach this with humility. Humility is essential, so that the answers can emerge. Did you drive? What you say is clear to me, but it doesn't match... It is a question of numbers. Or perhaps... The real problem is that we get a standard distance, however it is not correct. Did the journey seem short to you? You drove. You can't be objective. Did the trip seem short or very long to you? It seemed to me... rather short. Quite short... Have you listened to any music? No. No. If you had listened to some music, for example, two albums, we would have calculated how much music does an album contain, and we would have got the travel time. But we have to leave from standard elements such as: a kilometer is a lot, a minute is a lot, a meter is a lot and a second is a lot. Right now I'm talking about numbers and they don't match, sorry. Have you made any stops? Delays, accidents, toll booths, stops, red traffic lights, traffic jams? A toll booth. - A toll booth? - A toll booth, yes. - Only one? - Yes. - How much did you pay? - ?40. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Do you want to see the receipts? Yes, if you have them. Why "receipts"? A toll booth or more? No, just a toll booth. Do you have my wallet? Shit. - I do not have it. - Maybe in your pocket? I don't have it, it is in the car. - Do you think it was ?40? - Yes. Sure? Yes, I'm sure. So you left at 12:15 pm. No, we left around 11:30 am... Yes, 11:15 am... 11:20 am. It is not possible. The journey takes approximately 4 hours and 20 minutes. It matches 12:15 pm. Since it is now 4:35 pm. I can start from the base I want. But they give us a standard base, saying "it is this". My calculations don't add up. I can start from my base, according to what seems right to me... and what seems right to me, in numerical terms, it is 12:15 pm. Otherwise, one second... It is not this, it is that... Or that... We don't have to tell Juliette. She shouldn't worry about her brother. We have received your report to the headquarters. You sure have done some of the work. But I think we can push ourselves a little further. Have a look. Her name is... Genevieve Raynaud. She's not exactly great... Maybe not, but Mrs. Raynaud... She is indispensable, as we have seen during Mrs. Evrard's accident. If she's not there, it won't work. OK. Let's look at it differently. Tomorrow someone from the first shift will be run over by a train. - Who can't be? - Seriously? Nobody. We need everyone. But, Mr. Lef?vre, you have to play along. I don't make the rules, I am an employee, like you. I agree with Olivier, I think like him. We did what we could. What could be done has been done. Mr. Lemesle, I have no alternative. I have to go back to Paris with a solution. It must all be solved, I have to submit a detailed report to Mrs. Bonnet-Gu?rin. So I ask you... Tomorrow, someone from the first shift ends up under a train: who would be indispensable to the functioning of the department? Mrs. Couton, of course... Mrs. Couton stays. Ms. Hermine too. Two people who should definitely stay. So all the people we have mentioned so far, are indispensable? - They are indispensable. - Absolutely. OK, very good. Therefore... means we could... do without Nicole Lemercier, for instance. If we give up on Lemercier, it will be hell after the first incoming smallest issue. Mr. Lef?vre, we have too few. Sorry, but you don't understand. These people come to work when they are sick. Even when they are sick. We need to understand at what level we are. We are on red alert. But you didn't come right away with Mrs. Lemercier. It means she is less efficient. We wanted to train her for the pumps, she may be useful there. You will not train a person over 50 years old! Impossible, you don't do training for those over 50 years old. I'll put her on the list. If you haven't mentioned her, it means she is less efficient. So we put her on the termination list. I was just in time for his workshop. Look, it's unbelievable. I'm trying to film it, see? Lucas is so focused. He is so precise and focused. You have to keep up with your partner's pace and listen to each other. Position yourself well. He's so careful. It's good for him, I think. I love his expression. See? He seems to be doing better. You have to pay attention to this: To make him walk he must stand upright. He's beautiful, our son. The puppet is like a musical instrument. You have to practice, learn to play it... He's brave. I'm sure it helps. He's fine, look... Olivier, It's Philippe. Am I disturbing you? Listen... Go to the Financial Director... and calculate simulation of total volume... of premiums and bonuses of all executives within a year. I mean, for me, the other directors of the French sites, all Director Assistants and the top managers of the headquarters. That is, Bonnet-Gu?rin and her team. - Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for cumin. Hello. At the clinic they told you that was okay for tonight? Yes, they accepted 6 pm instead of 5 pm. I'll take this one. So... - I'm not sure. - Try it, use your face. They all have problems... - No, look. - Go on. Your car looks like a wreck. It seems that a part is missing. No, on the contrary. - Does it have extra parts? - It is very robust. Too many parts. I'll do it again, look. Does he suffer from road rage? Is it introverted? It is nervous? - Small and nervous? - No. A little... edgy? It is not edgy, on the contrary. - Is it severe? - No. - Does it only have two doors? - Yes. - A Beetle? - No. The model of... - Is it French? - No. - The model of what? - Italian? - No. - German, then. - No. I'll do it again. It's frightening. - Horrible. - Look. Is it English? Ancient? - Is it Italian? - German? It has a lot... - It has a lot of personality. - Mom, are you German? - Is it an Aston Martin? - I was going to say it! I thought about James Bond. No, it's more... More like that. Wait a minute, you're doing the opposite. - You just did... - I don't see what I'm doing. It's more... an Aston Martin would be more like that... Very much so. This car is more... I know what it is. I know what it is. - A very expensive car? - Very expensive. - Is it a Rolls-Royce? - Not at all. Shit! Isn't that an Aston Martin? We are on the wrong track, if it's not English... It is elegant and sporty. - Isn't that a Ferrari? - No. The other one you like. - Not a Porsche? - But yes! - But it's German, the Porsche! - I said it. - You've been saying it wasn't. - I was hoping it wasn't German. If us five plant managers, our subordinates, Bonnet-Gu?rin and her staff in Paris, give up our premiums and our bonuses for one year only, we can avoid employee layoffs and our factories are not at risk. What is it that doesn't convince you? I don't see it that way. I can cut the staff. There will be arms wrestling with the trade unions, but so be it. We've seen that before. What do we care? Jean-Pierre, that's not the point. I think if us, five directors, we go in front of Bonnet-Gu?rin with my solution, which is super solid, well argued, greatly structured, then I think we have a strong case. - I'm not sure. - Yes. A strong case. She will have to listen to us and report to the Americans and Cooper. This is how I see it. If you don't have the balls to cut the branches, It's your problem, not mine. We have the balls, and we ask you to have the balls to come with us to say Bonnet-Gu?rin what we must do differently. For me, meeting such a difficult requirement is a way to get out of my comfort zone and make progress. I think we have different goals. This will weaken our factories. Inevitably, one will end up giving in, we don't know which... and the other four will have to recover production. Maybe some of you - do you really want this? - Insult us, while you're at it. - I'm not insulting anyone. Mine is an engineer reflex, I try to understand... the logic of your position. You insult us and, as an engineer, can you give us management lessons? He's not insulting you and not giving lessons. - That's all he does. - No, he neither insults you, nor gives you lessons. But it is our duty, as plant managers, to notify the general management of the dangers of restructuring. I will be even more direct than Jean-Pierre. None of us steals salary and bonuses, we deserve them. Anyway, I will not give to the company my bonuses and rewards. Christophe, join us, I'm running out of arguments. Help me, explain it to him. It is true that I have not said anything so far, but I'm not sure anymore that it is necessary to fight against the management's economic plan. You, Christophe? Who put Bonnet-Gu?rin in her place and he talked to her... You remember what you said, right? Who explained to her that all this makes no sense... Are you saying that you changed your mind today? - Yes, and I have the right. - It is not a question of law. - The situation has not changed. - Mine does. The management made it clear that if I'm too cocky, I lose my job. How much do I have left? Four more years until I retire? I've been breaking my ass for years. I will not go without what they owe me, I deserved it. You are telling me you're okay with retirement leaving behind a weakened company? - Is that so? - Wait... You all realize that we are at a dead end? Philippe and I alone will never convince the Group. It's every man for himself. - Every man for himself? - It's not that simple... Yes, it is everyone for himself. - Philippe, stop fooling yourself. - I'm not. Yes, you do because it is possible that the Group wants that we run into a wall. Then it's easier to close factories in France and relocate them to low-wage countries. - And Cooper can get even richer. - It's exactly the other way around. Cooper wants to cut costs without endangering its companies. What I am desperately trying to tell you. Okay, but not with my money, or his, or his! Can I sit down? We came for a chat. Your father came to me with the list of textbooks you asked him. He didn't know if he should buy them or not, he asked for advice. I suggested to talk to you about it. What do you think? No, but it's normal to ask you for advice. But I absolutely need those books... to catch up and prepare for the year-end exam. Do you think you are left behind? I got a little behind, but it is normal. But I have to catch up. If I could have my books, it would be useful to me. Does it seem difficult to you to catch up for these 15 days? In any case, I really can't risk it to waste more time, not anymore. I'm already not very proud of what I did, I would like to get back to work. You don't have to be ashamed, you know? It happens to a lot of people. But what exactly are you ashamed of? You don't do these things in front of others, and I know that... that my classmates attack me on social media. It doesn't matter, I understand... but I have to catch up on time that I have spent here. Do you really need those books now... to prepare for your exam? Well, the sooner I get them, the sooner I can start to prepare for the exam. For example, on the list... You got it? Your father gave it to me. I wrote down the most important ones, But... about these they will question us for sure. Jean-Marie Peretti, Human resources, 2017. Sure, you have to know it by heart. The evolution of Toyotism since '93. A lot... You don't think you should rest a little longer, catch your breath? I'm rested and it's quiet here. I feel much better. That is amazing. And then, what really motivates me... That... I was lucky because my time here coincided with the holiday, so I didn't miss much. In that sense, I was very lucky. What do you think about what is Lucas is saying? Well... I'm glad he's feeling better. Maybe it's worth a try. He has worked hard in recent years, it would be foolish to penalize him, and it is also for his future. That's right, the job that I have done in recent years it takes shape now, in the year-end exam. - I understand, it's a lot of work. - Yes, that's a bit of a shame... But do you see yourself going back home? - Resuming the Business School... - I'm better. ...resuming the courses, do you feel like it? - Of course. - Doesn't that scare you? No, I'm not afraid. Here I took a break and it did me a lot of good. I am super motivated. Especially since, if I pass the exam, I will have a job at Facebook. So that's really cool. It motivates me even more to commit myself. Do you already know that you will be hired by Facebook? - Yes. - Since when? - If I pass the exam. I posted my resume on Facebook, and Mark Zuckerberg answered me. He said he's interested. So great. I just have to pass the exam. It will be a formality, if I have the books. And then things will run their course. Did you talk to him on the phone? First on Messenger, then he gave me his number. So I could explain things clearly to him. All right... wow... When did it happen? Recently. While you were here? Did everything fall into place? The phone call, the resume? How did you understand that he would hire you after the exam? Because I felt his enthusiasm, from how he listened to me, and the ideas I proposed for Facebook. I felt he was excited, so I took advantage of it, and in the end he made an offer to me if I pass the exam. An important position. So I need those books fast to prepare for the exam. I have read your alternative proposal, and I'll tell you right away, I am both dissatisfied and disappointed in the way you handled it. I have personally vouched to Mr. Cooper that you would deliver your conclusions on time. I'm late now. I ask you for the conclusions and the lists as soon as possible. The other European sites did it without any problems. - Not true. - We know that's not true. In Germany and Italy, some directors are in the same situation. We know everything went very well. The plant managers talk to each other. We share information. Denis, I only see an opportunity for Americans to say that the French do not face challenges. Claire, why don't you consider our proposal as an opportunity for the Group? Meaning? Instead of seeing it as an obstacle, why not interpret it as a signal? A strong signal for everyone. And a way to demonstrate to our collaborators that all the executives of Elsonn share the risks. At the same time, that the Group defends values that Mr. Cooper emphasizes so much in all his speeches. "Fairness and generosity". Let's talk about this. - Is there a business strategy? - Yes. - Do you know it by heart? - Yes. Let's stick to that. We stick to it if the strategy is beneficial. But at any cost? A strategy that throws our results and our collaborators in uncertainty: do we stick to it anyway? Is this the policy? Everything is uncertain. Life, health, love, work. So, it will be clear, I'm not going to hand this over to Mr. Cooper. Because, if you continue on this road, you will give a deplorable image to the American board. He is right, you are an exceptional manager. I'm not flattering you, we all know. You were extraordinary two years ago, and I was the first to give you praise for the work done with the layoff plan. Now what's gotten into you, from one day to another? They will not understand. We are here to make proposals - concrete, alternative, to defend an idea. It is wonderful to defend one's ideas, but do you realize the consequences? You can lose your job that you are putting into play. It is a steep price for an idea. Let's talk about defending our work. - This is what we're talking about. - You're doing it very badly. If you don't, others will do it in your place. No questions asked. You have a special relationship with the trade unions, you can make them swallow anything. Do not risk for other negotiators to face them. You are extraordinary, respected by your teams, because you respect them. Take advantage of this to present conclusions acceptable to Mr. Cooper and his team, and less painful for those that will leave, and also for those who will stay. Focus on this. That's what the company wants from you now. I need you now. I'm sorry to tell you that... No. We will not be able to fulfill this request. If you do not satisfy the request, you take your responsibilities. We are not here to obstruct, Claire. We are here to defend the company in the long term. I'm not deaf, Philippe. And you, do you listen to me? I will not present this to Mr. Cooper and his staff. I personally vouched to Mr. Cooper that all French sites will respond in the same way. Agree. It means that if Denis and I do not fulfill the request, we risk our jobs. And Mr. Cooper will see this refusal as a consequence of your failed policies. Of course. - You're going too far. - Why? You can't get the benefits without the drawbacks. Mr. Baumont, please. No advantages without drawbacks. You are at the head of the Elsonn France group, right? So, if we... poor little directors of a regional plant, we don't do our homework, because you can't make us do it. This is what Mr. Cooper will think. The great director of Elsonn France declares this meeting closed. - It's not over. - We stop here. Mr. Lemesle, it's been five minutes since... - It's not over. - At this point, we have nothing to lose. I didn't think I'd come to this. Claire, I tell you clearly, Pulcinella's little secret: that Mr. Cooper wants to appoint you as the head of European zone, right? - And what do you want to say? - Everybody knows. Everyone knows it, Claire. So I have a question: Are you prepared to disappoint Mr. Cooper? telling him that two directors of the establishment, Denis and I, will not respond to the request? Are you ready to take the risk? He will see it as a management failure. Are you aware of it? I ask if you are ready to take this risk. Answer me. If you can't answer me, present this proposal to Mr. Cooper and his staff. We ask no more. Good morning. Take a seat. We wanted to see you because we would like to know if the rumors circulating in the company are founded. Elsonn is rumored to be preparing a layoff plan that would concern 10% of the workforce. Who said that? It doesn't matter who said it. We want to know if it's true or not. Madam... Mrs. Laurent, you ask me for a meeting in my office, so I want to know who is spreading those rumors. We are not here for that. But because of these rumors, some of us are worried and also angry. It's not my job to make rumors, to confirm or deny. What does it mean? That the rumors are well founded? - Are they partly true? - I did not say this. And, if I had an announcement to make, I wouldn't do it in this office, you see? There are legal procedures, you know the rules. Okay, there are procedures, but the workers are worried. If there's really nothing going on, you can tell us. Simple. I cannot. - Yes you can. - No. Legally there is nothing that forbids it. I want to know who is spreading those rumors. Disrupting a team is easy. I can do that too. If no layoffs are planned, tell us it's not true, Then we leave. End of story. Then we can reassure people, okay? And we end it here. - If that pleases you, fine. - It's not to please us. That's not what we're here for, okay? We will not give you names. You must understand that people in your factory are worried. People talk... Maybe, instead, it would be better to keep quiet. Sir, it's simple: Tell us there is no layoff plan in place and we leave. - I'm telling you. - Excuse me? I am telling you. Do you guarantee us that Elsonn has no layoffs plan right now? Is this it? - Exactly, yes. - Okay. So you declare officially that Elsonn doesn't have a plan of dismissal right now? And we can share it with colleagues, right? Exactly. Thank you. Denis, can you answer? You know very well that the factory cannot function with fewer people. - Yes it can. - No. It will collapse, Mr. Lemesle. It will collapse and you know it. It will hold up. It will collapse, I tell you. Do you think that I want to ruin everyone? - It's not collapsing, I tell you. - Sir, excuse me. I have a simple question. What is the purpose of the Americans with this layoff plan? Squeeze ourselves more and more, more and more? Squeeze us until the company collapses? And after that, what will we do? Let me finish. All our skills will go abroad? Letizia, you're imagining things. There's no conspiracy behind it. I don't imagine anything. We will reorganize and we will find solutions. What solutions? Let me tell you something: A few years ago you would've never allowed it. - Not true. - It is so. - A moment... - Never... You don't care. At the end of the year you fill your pockets. Don't talk to me like that. I talk how I want. For the last seven years you have been cutting back, making us overworked. We are tired, and you fill your pockets. Don't go down the road of offense or insinuation! Who is insulting who? No, you're going too far. Mr. Lemesle didn't insult you. If there is always quality dialogue in this company, it's thanks to him. We are getting nowhere. I would like to get to one point. I would like to come back to one thing. Your word. We were in your office, you looked at us and said: "No layoff plan". Is it true or not? I told you it was not the right place to make an announcement. That's not what he said. If you want me to invent things to please you... Mr. Lemesle couldn't have told you more. He knows perfectly well what he said. - He couldn't have told you more. - Of course he did! I ask you again: Yes or no? Yes or no? Yes or no? Did you tell us there wasn't a layoff plan? Yes or no? I told you it was not the right place to announce a layoff plan. By the way, since you were there, remember that I have evoked the law. - That's not true. - You are lying, sir. You mentioned the law and that it was not the right place, but in the end you made us a promise. That nothing was expected, you said it. You may have not understood correctly. We did not understand? Do you think we have not understood? And you too? Did I misunderstand? And Cedric too? Did Jean get it wrong? Are you sure you want to go down this road? You can look me in the eye and tell me that I misunderstood? Are you sure you want to play this game? Then I'll tell you one thing: that conversation... we recorded it. This is outrageous! You talk to us about trust since we've been here and then secretly record? That's not trust! - We fight with what we have. - We protect ourselves. How can we have confidence? I propose that we listen to Cedric's cell phone. What do you say, Mr. Lemesle? What do you think? ...Tell us there is no layoff plan in place and we leave. Excuse me? I'll tell you. Do you guarantee us that Elsonn has no layoff plan right now? Is this it? Exactly, yes. Okay. So you declare officially that Elsonn doesn't have a plan of dismissal right now? Beautiful space and yet it feels cozy. True. And the heating? - Floor heating. - Okay. There is a heat pump outside, connected to the boiler, which heats very well. Even these large spaces? No, the heat rises and no need for other heat sources for the mezzanine. - No need. - Just the boiler is enough... Yes, absolutely. - Just in case, there's a fireplace. - Exactly. We didn't expect it. Indeed. I love this space. Very cozy. The house has many nooks. You can be alone and still be together. Exactly. One can work upstairs, the other rests below. Ideal for a family. The living spaces run into each other. They are shared. It's exactly what we're looking for. And the bedrooms are isolated... You can still have privacy. Absolutely. It would be nice to show it to Jeanne. I'm sure she would like it. Could we see it again? Of course. Our little girl would be thrilled to give her opinion. It will not be difficult to convince her. - Do you have a daughter? - Yes. A four-year-old girl. What do you think? I love it. Exceptional. Love at first sight. We made some things nicer. That can be fun too. Of course. And the light? On the South. Directly on the South. In summer it must be... magical, full of light. Are you staying in the region? No, we're moving. "With your irresponsibility and lack of leadership, you have violated the French laws, deliberately lying to the union representatives, stating, in your office, that the Elsonn Group did not consider a layoff plan. Furthermore, the recorded conversation was obtained by the media, while not preventing its implementation, it has hindered the peaceful application of the Group's economic plan, and has seriously compromised the image of the company, its deep ethical commitment and respect that is the basis of well-being of employees and the brand. Furthermore, the well-known friendship with your Director of Operations, Olivier Lef?vre, undermined your managerial authority, preventing you from realizing the vision of the Elsonn Group. This lack of dedication to the values of Elsonn prevented you from developing a constructive dialogue with staff representatives, in order to carry out the restructuring necessary for the survival of the company. Noting the extreme gravity of the facts, the Elsonn Group proceeds to your dismissal for serious misconduct to the effect of immediate departure and without severance pay." Do you want to say something? I would like to say just one thing: I expected more loyalty from the Elsonn Group. I understand. But perhaps Elsonn expected more loyalty from you. But I was loyal. I've done my job. I have the feeling that you didn't get the full support. What do you mean? I'm asking you a question. Don't you think... Perhaps... I'm not saying that you did everything right. But... we could say, maybe... maybe you will agree, that the one who has hindered the peaceful execution of the restructuring plan the most... Let Lef?vre be your Director of Operations? Olivier Lef?vre? Why... What is the task of a Director of Operations? Support and accompany the plant manager. - Do you agree? - Yes. Not to put a stick in the wheel. Lef?vre did nothing else. Do you think I'm not aware? Do you really think that no one tells me anything? It is true that because of my position, I spend my time at the headquarters in Paris. But I get it all. I know it all. I know what happens, practically in real time, at each site of the Group. Mr. Baumont, tell him what you told me after you spent the day on the site of Mr. Lemesle. Of that visit, I remember very well that Lef?vre was extremely negative about the economic plan wanted by the Group. Do you remember that... we wrote names on the list? We can say that Mr. Lef?vre put up a lot of resistance. He was against everything. We could even say that he completely refused to collaborate on the project. When we have... Philippe, look at me. When we have a role of responsibility, like Lef?vre's, shouldn't we put the public interest before our personal scruples? Yes. I think that... your friend Olivier Lef?vre, took you too far for too long on the ground of feelings. That's also what we like about you. Your value. Your great humanity. Everyone recognizes it. But the fact is that at the end of the day you are the only one who pays. I find it very unfair. I think Mr. Lef?vre is totally responsible for this fiasco. I'll go a little further. In my opinion, Elsonn would have all the interest to get rid of someone like Lef?vre. For several reasons. I'll mention only two. First, what I believe is the most important one - the well-being of employees. When an element like him, with his level of responsibility, prevents a smooth course of industrial policy, he just creates a mess. That happens constantly. And I think he was very sneaky. I'm going one step further. I think that he had an idea for a while. Because right now, the position that is vacant, Philippe, it's yours. I don't think it's fair that it's you who has to carry the cross for everything. And here I come to the second reason. If you agree to help us to ensure that Mr. Lef?vre leaves the company, I think it would be a great opportunity for you, to prove that you are back in the saddle, that you take back control. It would allow everyone to say, starting with Mr. Cooper: "Of course, he is cut out for the task that we have entrusted to him." And I also say that... You know, I have great respect for you, so I'm telling you as a friend, it's also the opportunity to say: "It was a misstep." And as to this setback, makes it a strength a means for the future, of your professional career. Here's what I think. Does it mean that, if I accept your proposal, I start with a clean slate for Mr. Cooper? Is that right? As if nothing had happened? I'm convinced that he'd appreciate it. For sure. Dear Mrs. Bonnet-Gu?rin, A few days ago, you gave me the chance to renew the confidence that the company had initially placed in me. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove who I am. By canceling the contract of my Director of Operations, Mr. Olivier Lef?vre, I'd avoid being fired for my mistakes. I'm lucky, because, it is with your offer, I could understand what kind of man I have become in your eyes and, without a doubt, in the eyes of many others. A despicable man, if you think I could accept your proposal, as I am solely responsible of any inefficiency at my factory. Responsible for obliging the foremen to turn a blind eye to dangerous procedures in assembly lines. Responsible for lying to my team, while I was constantly abusing their loyalty and devotion. I was the good soldier that you wanted me to be. You call that courage, but I call it cowardice or stupidity. The few qualities I do possess, I didn't even need them to see our madness. I've done all of this for a hefty salary and I certainly would even for much less, because where I thought to find intelligence I found nothing but indecency. My freedom certainly comes with a cost, but it's still priceless. Consequently, I ask firmly that the totality of faults that you attribute to me, fall exclusively on me and only on me, as you phrased it. Those words describe exactly the man in the position that the Elsonn Group had entrusted to me. And most importantly, they describe a man I don't want to have as a friend as a father or as a husband. Sincerely, Philippe Lemesle.
