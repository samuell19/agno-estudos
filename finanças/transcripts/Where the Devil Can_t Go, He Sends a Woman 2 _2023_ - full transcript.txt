WHERE THE DEVIL CAN'T GO, HE SENDS A WOMAN 2 Once again, my condolences. God bless you. What a terrible outcome. - Antek is dead. Kazik is in prison. - Thanks for coming. Don't cry. It's not your fault. If I can do anything… Come on. There is one thing. Will you come to Berlin with me? Antek hid some money there. Our and the boys'. I found his passcodes. Where? In his hat! It's a long story. Will you join me? I will. - You can count on me. - Thank you. I have nobody else I can trust. See you tonight. Are you proud of yourself? If not for you, he'd still be alive! So? Are you? Why… Why did you bring her? Can't you just leave her with her mother? Mummy's dead. Died in a car accident. I am so sorry. - What's your name? - Zuzia. Hello, I'm Marzena. What do you want to be when you grow up? A cop, just like dad. I want to help people. You'll be great at this. I'm certain. Come on, kiddo. Let's leave the lady be. Good bye. About time, colonel! I'm a minister now. Don't you read the papers? Wacek? What are you doing here? Mr. Trojan is my accountant. You didn't know? He's been overseeing your little booze cartel. And? What did he see? That you would cheat me. It all amounted to over fifty million. US dollars. 70% for the minister. That is… 35 million. And you gave us three. A tenth of what you owed. So now you'll give us everything. I don't have this money. Antek put it in a safety deposit box. Only he knew the passcode. And he didn't write them down? On a piece of paper? In his calendar? Notebook? I swear on God, colonel! General, sir. If I knew about a notebook, I'd tell you. Please give us a moment. You see… People are tired of the transformation. The pressure is increasing. I don't blame them. There will be blood. And I can guarantee you one thing. It'll be your blood. You killed a cop on duty. No statute of limitations on that. I'll lay it out for you. You will go to prison. Your wife. And Sabrina. And your son will be extremely lucky if he manages to hang himself in an orphanage. We'll turn his life into hell. And then you'll hang yourself. You know… We don't forgive. However! All the evidence can remain secret. It can also see the light and show up on the prosecutors desk. You decide. Let's not rush this. We can reach an understanding. We can. If you bring us the 50 million. Just don't run. You know what will happen. Death penalty. Right. Get cracking! Quiet! Check out the hat! What the hell? Carve up our employer? Back off. I have specific orders. In that case.… Cut it. Don't let it bite you! Lost and found. Right. Let's split. DETENTION FACILITY You killed him, you bastard! Get out! I did. With your daughter's father's hands. And with your help. Just one word and you'll go down with us. Understand? - I do. - Good. Here's a new assignment. Keep an eye on Marzena. She'll get the money. Now let me go. You don't want Kazik seeing us together. You're the one holding me. Right. I didn't notice. Take me to my chop shop. We need to act. Marzena found the passcodes. She's going to Berlin to get the money. Stop her at any cost. What if that's not the notebook he wanted? There's no money, just letters! You knuckledragger! It's a code! We need to break it! Like the Germans broke Enigma. - Watch and learn. - Go on. Take every third digit. Like that. And substitute letters. S – T U – P D. STUPID? What's that? Maybe it's… How do you say… Morse code? The boss will know. You go home. I need to do something first. Tell Starczewski that I need a car with diplomatic plates. To avoid checks at the border. Can't do it faster? - Good evening. Passports, please. - Good evening. Good evening. Where did I put my passport? It was right here! Oh, there it is. Is this a joke? Is it what? I can't let you through. You need a new passport. I need to cross! If he loves you, he'll wait. I can't let you through with this passport. Please turn around. What's wrong? What is it? We're closed. We're here for general Starczewski. One moment. The minister will see you now. I'm not going to count it. Sure thing. Trust is the foundation of any business. Right. You're free to go. Go and sin no more. Wait a moment. Sir… What shall we do now? I don't know. You just paid for freedom for everyone. Bączek! Here! Start a new venture! Don't hold a grudge. Just keep the story about the TV-set and the cop to yourself. Murder isn't booze. No statute of limitations. You're not going to take it? We can buy three stolen cars with that! We can start new! And again we have to steal the first million. Where is Antek's money? Marzena! - You're completely… - Where's the money? The well is dry. Get to work, miss! You need a rod, not a fish! That's deep! Did you come up with this? No. Heard it on TV. The minister of employment said so. How can you talk to her like this? She lost her husband! Our pockets are empty too. Please believe me. Out of respect for Antek. A grand is all I can do. One grand? I wouldn't pay more than 800. The car is stolen, can't leave the country. That's just 900. The offer is time limited. My next word is 700. You better take it. We got ourselves a decent car. PAWN SHOP But… Good bye. My queen! In my previous capacity I'd give you a medal. You helped bring criminals to justice. Cut the crap. Give me my daughter's address. Let's be honest. This is our last contact. Kazik is done. I don't need you. Don't tell him about our deal or he'll know you reported on him. And Antek's case could back-fire on you. Good night. - Hello? - I pity you. I'll give you the address. Olecko. Zamkowa 6. Her adopted name is Małek. Excuse me! I can't find Zamkowa 6. That's here. Who are you looking for? The name is Małek. A Couple with a little girl. Aren't you that Sandra from television? The famous singer? No, that's not me. Right. She's younger. Way younger. Excuse me! I'm looking for Mr. and Mrs. Małek. I have their address here. - Małek? - Is that you? Don't be afraid. It's not. It's not us. It's… It's a terrible tragedy. You didn't know them? I didn't. I'll show you. This way. JAN AND ZDZISŁAWA MAŁEK URSZULA MAŁEK, 7 DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT PRAY FOR THEIR SOULS Hi! Hi, Wojtek. What do you have for me? Know this one? Kazimierz Bączek. Partner at Posnania. Informal boss of a booze smuggling ring, active all over Poland. Never did time for the booze. All we got is small fish. - Got something on him? - I do. Why not arrest him? He's well connected. You could get him. Here's everything. Enough to make it stick. - What do you want in return? - Justice. I take offence in every day he gets to walk the streets. Do you get that? Kazimierz Bączek – Who is the godfather of the alcohol smuggle? Just think about it. We've been together so long and nobody noticed. Not even Dorota and Karol. Right. Speaking of Karol… Interesting new line of business. Cars from the West. Make an appointment with Karol. You haven't talked in a year and suddenly you miss him? Tell him I have a business proposition. A lot of money to be made. Tell him we can hit some suckers. I will. Now get back to bed! It's getting late. Come here! You're as beefy as my beef tartare! The new reality treats you well! It's not much, but it's ours. Where do you unload them? We don't sell cars. We sell dreams. DO-KAR. Dorota and Karol. The place to buy the car of your dreams. - As our prime minister says… - I heard that. But… Where do people get the money? Can't you see what's happening? People have discovered their entrepreneurial spirt! People are scared of the inflation and they come to us. We give them an address in Germany, for which they pay us a percentage. Like the old times! Not at all! They buy used cars there for a good price. And they bring them here. We sell the cars within three months. It's better than stealing! We could steal on top of that! That's a premium job now. We get orders from Russia. Or for parts. You had me at "premium". Now we're talking. Want me to line something up? Magda told me you have a proposition? About hitting some suckers? That's right. How much is in it? We're not cutting newspapers again! Those days are over! You see… Business is good, but it's not quite Posnania. Talk to me. I want in on the cars. We'll run up the scale and make money like before. You know I like you. They write about you in the papers. And you're a bit compromised. And you're the innocent one? You didn't know about the booze? I'm sorry, but it's not my mug on the cover! Hello, Kazik! Been a while. Take this to accounting. I'm off to the bank. Has everyone found the car of their dreams? I have. There's the office. Follow me, please. Bye. What a rocket. Are you three… You know… In difficult times a family business is the best answer. One motivates the customers and the other one counts the money. I wish I had your health. We'll talk on the phone? Sure thing. And swing by anytime. Remember, I'd do anything with you! Karol! So would I! Are you here to see me? This way, please. Are you compromised? Bunny! Join us! It's about to rain. Bączek speaking. Hello, Kazik! I wanted to call you right after you were released from… From the hospital. I didn't find the time. I'm terribly busy. You might have hear I am ending my career. I'm opening a car dealership network. I'm going to need your hookers. They are no hookers! They provide an exclusive escort service. Our girls are sophisticated and have class. - With linguistic talent. - Oh, I hear that! Send me your escort students, then. There's a ton of money to be made. I'm on my way, my dear friend! WARSAW, 1994 Nice ride. It's a Lincoln Town Car. It's a good looking American city automobile. Model year 1989. Expat import So you're returning for good? I'm not. But it's a good way to avoid taxes and duties. To make some money. A very nice ride indeed. Good day! It's Boguś! - Our best customer. - Money for the last delivery. He buys in bulk. - It's all there. - I need cars like this one! You do? It's this gentleman's expat import. Straight from the land of the free. President Lincoln drove one! That's just a myth. - No president drove this car. - Really? One still might! I'll take it. Got any more? We do American-style weddings. All over Poland. I respect that. I have seven of these. We'll take them. Dana! Dana will keep you company tonight. Dana, Dana… Everybody's done her, right? Come with me, darling. Come back in two months for the money. We'll take care of everything. Don't be shy. Everybody told me to write you off. But I stayed adamant! I told them "Kazik is Kazik!". Money will always come back to him! I want in on your business. What business? Your exclusive escort and prostitute service. But… I'm sorry, but I can't. My business model is trust! So you don't trust me? Of course I do. But for our clients, domestic and foreign, I am the face of the brand. We have high level patrons! Businessmen. Nobel prize winners. Artists. Even two sultans! And sheiks from Qatar! They'll build a port here. And a wharf. Right. We did great with the dealerships. That is just the start. Thanks to my fame and considerable sports talent we are about to host some high-profile guests. High ranking government officials. New government officials. Just imagine the business! Stolen goods won't feed you, but government contracts won't hurt you! Applause for Mr. Komar! Boss! Our ministers are here! What are you talking about? Wait a second! Let's welcome the new minister of economy - to our traditional… - Not now, pretty ladies. Not now. It was good to send him girls, even when he was on the opposition. Girls, please go upstairs. Up, up! Kazimierz! Your country needs you. We need young people who can do business. That's who he is! Yes! He fought the communists, was interned during martial law, and a big talent for business. We need a new way of thinking. Get the country back on its feet. But there's a problem. - What kind of problem? - The booze problem. It's all over the press. That is not what we need. You call that a problem? Kazik could change his name. New name, new game. Brilliant. That won't be a problem! The minister of interior is our friend. Problem solved. What's the new name? Kowalski? Iwanowski? Poniatowski or Wajda. Nothing less. He's an ambitious one! Just make sure the press stays silent. We will not fall on swords for you. Gold doesn't rust. My words exactly! So, how about… Time for our family feud! Girls! Come back down! Come on in! Dear minister, take your pick! Kulesza speaking. Regarding Bączek? Always. Right. In 30 minutes. I won't tell anyone. Sure thing. I have an urgent errand to run. Did you call me? I have something for your paper. About my boss. Boss? Kazimierz Bączek. - What do you expect in return? - Nothing. I'm sick of this crook. The pay is shit, he's abusing me, feeding lies and stealing from people in committees. You write about it, and Bączek gets a lesson. - Heavy stuff. - Because he's a heavy caliber. I could get you more. Let me first take a look at this. Are you going to talk? He's not. Maciejak. Take it easy! Maciejak! Got it. - What did you do? - He attacked me! You killed him, you idiot! There's a factory you can buy. Ceramics. With a staff of 2000. A factory? Why would I need a factory? Polish factories are ruined. That's just a story. Planted by the military to compromise Gierek in the 80s. And everyone believed it. Even Solidarity with its big thinkers. Those factories are gems! And how much is this… How much is it worth? 15 million dollars. 15 million? How do I come up with that? I'm not cutting newspapers again! My hand would fall off. And I'm not touching my rainy-day-money. It's too risky. In reality the factory is worth ten times that. The price is for the lot and the buildings. I'm not touching my 15 million. - No way. - Sure thing. All you have to pay is 15 000. That's the only money you'll spend. Kazik! You could come up with that from your dealerships! This much I can pay. Now listen. You pay the 15 grand. You buy the factory from the government. You get 52% shares in a company. You become the CEO. As CEO you go over the books… And you find a fortune! - Now you're talking! - Now you listen! There's 20 million dollars well hidden in the factory's accounts. Revenue from previous years. We can't touch the money. They'd eat us alive. A new private owner however… We will not interfere with your private business! Right. I find the 20 million. And then what? You transfer the 15 million to the ministry and the factory is paid for. You're the hero who saved a Polish company from going broke. And the remaining five million… We'll split among us. In three equal parts. There is just one problem. What kind of problem? How to split five million in three equal parts! That is not a problem! Let me calculate that! I'm here to see Witek Kulesza. Can't get ahold of him. Neither can we. He hasn't come in for a week. It's not unusual though. He does that quite often. He was gone for a month once. Is that the right color? Tell him to call me when he resurfaces. Maciejak. Poznań metropolitan police. Hold on. When I saw him last, he got a phone call and ran out. He left this. [Bączek = Bumblebee] Are you sure it's here? I know the place, I know the guy. That's the office. They screwed us for all our money! Slow down. The search is ongoing for the journalist from Poznan, Witold Kulesza, who went missing three weeks ago. Right. Probably moved abroad. Lots of people leave the country. Right. In search of a better tomorrow. And what do we have? A better today! I have it all figured out. The name will be Team Porcelana Kazimierz Poniatowski. K. K-full stop-Poniatowski. Kazimierz sounds like the old me. Full stop or not. Money and fame. The only two things that matter. And beautiful women. That's on you. Mother of God, they're here! Quickly! Give me ten seconds! Quickly! Line up in three rows! Quickly! Close to the stairs. Three rows. Come on. Good day! Good day, Mr. Chairman! We were expecting you in an hour. I'm here now. Yes, of course. Welcome to Włocławek, sir. Would you like to say a few words to our team? Gladly. Thank you. As of yesterday, the name of the factory is K-full stop-Poniatowski. That's my name. And that's an obligation. An obligation for you to work hard! This is like Buckingham Palace! Minus Prince Charles. Look at the stained glass! It's all ready for you, Kaz… I mean Mr. Poniatowski. You have a visitor, sir. Ask him in. And you go find Marzena. She works here. And take the wheel with you. Certainly, Kazik. I see you're doing good, Bączek! I'd prefer Mr. Poniatowski. My dear Bączek! How many timed did you try to defy me? What good did it bring you? We will renew our deal. But this time more privately. You bet on the wrong horse, general! Did you have to join the incompetent Solidarity? We have a new government now and they are close friends. Partners even. And do they now about your charges for killing an official? I told you. No statute of limitations on murder. Please send in my deputies. It's time to clear up this supposed murder. The supposed victim of the supposed murder is alive and well. The former state security agent is long since retired, but any charges for his injury are past their statute of limitations. So… General, your blackmail operation is unfounded. You can make a hole in any drawer. Any drawer. Magda, show the gentleman out. You won't say no to a woman, will you? No. I won't. Well done! - One million, as agreed. - Nice. Thank you. Good bye. Wait here, please. Krysia! Krysia Bączek! I mean… Poniatowski! Hello, Karol! I didn't change my name. I see you run your own business! Well done! - Did Kazik contribute? - Are you crazy? We're long out of touch. Can't feed my child from my janitor job. - Right. - I had some money from better times. I'll try my luck with this cafe. How's Dorota? We're doing great. All is well. We sell cars. We'll come by for coffee and ice-cream. Say hi to Dorota! Who's she? That's Krysia Bączek! Kazik's wife. - What a nice surprise! - Hello, Kazimierz. Are you married? No. That's good. Are you with someone? No. Better still. Dinner? Tonight? I can't. Tomorrow then. I'll be blunt then. I don't want to. Did nobody tell you to not say "no" to the prime minister and the chairman? I always liked you. But, you know… A friend's girl used to be a thing off-limits. I'm not a thing! We could get far, Marzena. Antek was never good enough for you. He had no ambition. Why do you interrupt me? Marzena, wait! It's not how it looks! Sir! You can't do that. I can't? So fire her. We can't fire her. Her designs got us contracts in Japan, Great Britain, and Canada. We're negotiating with Australians. This brings huge profits And she owns the copyright to those designs. Then you quit. Quit? But… I've been managing the plant for 12 years. Nobody knows the company better than I do. - I know all the secrets. - Magda, please join us. Magdalena will replace you as general manager. We need women in high places. Enough of this macho-bullshit. And it's not up for debate. Good bye, Mr. Bączek. - He's not going to let it slide. - I know. This documents the takeover by Bączek-Poniatowski. It was my life insurance, but you might need it more. Thank you. You called me, so here I am. Let's start over. My name is Marzena. I don't even know your name. It's not lieutenant, is it? Wojtek. I need to show you something important. We got the bastard. It's a primitive scam. He's not getting out of it? No way. Finally! Dad! It's the middle of the night! I can't sleep! It's a school night. I'm sorry, dear. Let me introduce you. - This is Marzena and this… - We've met. - I remember you wanted to be a cop. - Still do. Good choice. Go to sleep. It's lights out soon. Lights out? All right! Let's be quick and brutal! Come on! The suspect can be armed and dangerous. We're coming in hot! That is not possible. Police! Financial Crime Unit! Where is Bączek? Chairman Poniatowski is in a meeting. Please, move. Kazimierz Bączek, you are under arrest for multiple counts of fraud and working to the detriment of the company currently known as K. Poniatowski. - Cuff him! - It's a misunderstanding! He wants to destroy me! I'll take care of this! I'm calling the ministry! You're done! We'll talk later! What about us? Are they going to arrest us? I won't go to prison! - I'd rather eat a gun! - Don't panic! Until a verdict is returned, and this may be a while, we're in charge. Get dressed. DETENTION FACILITY I'm here to see my client. Come in. I didn't expect you here. I retirement this boring? I am retired, but I still have connections. Your friends want to pin all on you. They'll go down with me. They won't. You'll hang yourself in the cell. I am all you have left. Here's the deal. I will protect you for a fee. How much? A million will get your case thrown out. A million and a half will turn you into a business-martyr. Tell you what. You'll get two. And you'll destroy this communist cop! The district court for Poznań, after the hearing on 21 May 1997, finds the defendant Kazimierz Bączek, now Poniatowski, not guilty on all charges. He fell victim of the private vendetta of policeman Wojciech Maciejak who repeatedly overstepped authority. To sum up – the court files motions with the prosecutor's office to start an investigation and to the police headquarters to suspend and expel lieutenant Maciejak. We all need to understand that the People's Republic is over. The Republic of Poland does not condone the persecution of honest entrepreneurs. The backbone of our nation. Session adjourned. My utmost respect for the judicial system. Bravo! Kazik! I always knew you were innocent! Let me give you a hug! I've had enough of this Polish hell. Every smart man wears a target on his back. - Let's go. - I so happen to have a lucrative proposal! A distant cousin of Prince Charles', 63rd heir to the throne, has a humble hut for sale. In France. It's perfect for you. - Could you say a few words for me? - Most certainly. I'd do everything for you. Is everything all right? I'm innocent. Let's not make a show. The past is the past. We're meant for each other. DIJON, FRANCE 1997 It's fantastic. Splendid! Merci! You're so generous! The city of Dijon! Named after the French mustard. Bonjour, monsieurs! You're leaving the steering wheel? I don't think they steal cars in France! Tell him to give us a discount. We'll turn it into a vacation home for workers of our ceramics factory. I was thinking more about a place for our family feuds! You never mentioned any factory workers! Filip! This has to be for the workers! We're using their social benefit fund! Look how pretty it is! Bobby DeNiro won't be coming then… Filip! It'll be for our best workers. 18 to 20 years, nice bodies, swimsuits. Come in! I need a picture of this. Lieutenant Maciejak on his last day before early retirement! Cheese! Cheese! One more! Cheese! Did you pack everything? Let me show you something. Look at this. FLOODWAVES OF ILLEGAL SPIRIT So? All those years for nothing? Hey! We have to live. We deserve something from life. What is that? This? Colonel Starczewski. Military intelligence. He was covering them for years. No. This! Sabrina was Starczewski's informant. She was his ears around Bączek. I thought you knew. Now I get it. Bloody liar. I shouldn't have shown you. You said we deserved something. You're right. We need to live. New Year's Eve 1999/2000 Filip! I'm so glad you're here! I can't understand anyone! I brought some investors with me! From Saudi Arabia! You know them well, but this time they brought their wives. Bonsoir, Kazimierz the Great! Soir, my friend! Bonsoir! Bonsoir, minister! You should come by more often. Gladly! You could let us in on some business… Like we did with Posnania. You know you can count on me. A warm welcome to our employees in our Dijon vacation home. That's the right accent! My friends! Today, for us here, in Dijon, and for people across the world the new millennium is the word! What a rhyme! A true poet! Applause! This things happen once every thousand years so let's kick this new year off with a new-world attraction! Kazimierz Bączek, the Columbus of our times! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Roll in! Ta-dam! - I've been baking for a week. - A beauty. Wait! Dom Perignon. I sold a painting! Wow! For so much money? - All right! - Wait! It's not midnight yet! Some are already celebrating! Not now. I'll see you tonight. It's not about that. It's about the company. I need to talk to my wife. Kazik! You haven't divorced your first wife! That needs to happen. It's my new year's resolution. Sabrina! It's going to be a wonderful year! But without me. Since she's already here, let her stay. Hook up with Filip the pimp. What a nice threesome. What are you saying? You destroy everything of value in your life. Everything! Włocławek, 2001 K. Poniatowski Ceramics Factory We're here about the new technology. Korean technology that'll allow us to reduce employment. In order for it to work, we need to invest another 20 million. Can we afford this? - With some careful accounting. - Wait! What technology? It's news to me. We laid people off twice. There will be hardly anyone here soon. A factory without workers? Worker's vacation resort Don't worry! I'll find you a nice guardian. I'll top up your phone. Put some money in your college fund. Right, let's have breakfast. Just be careful, it's slippery! Hello? One moment, Jerzy. Good morning, ladies! Talk to me. What's going on? There's one thing. We could acquire some new technology. From South Korea. No investments! I am the one waiting for money! You keep forgetting our vacation resort! - How do you call this? - Re-investing in your company. My dear Kazik! You have worked so hard for this! And our legal team is costing us a lot! You need to invest in me, not the other way round. We'll go bankrupt! We can't afford it! Work hard to avoid bankruptcy so we can afford everything. Do I need to teach you? This will allow to cut the workforce in half! You'll get new machines! When they wear out you can sell them for scrap! That's what I like to hear. We need to take out a loan against our assets. Handle everything. Right. Thank you. Enjoy your vacation. We'll send you the documents. Financing is taken care of. Remember everything? The Korean technology that'll allow us to reduce employment? Hello, Wacek! What brings you to our humble abode? I gave you the go-ahead. Did you come all the way just to tell me this? I came here to… You're having all the fun without me? Lend me your ear. I went to New York and there's this idea. A great opportunity. I'm listening. - Sit down and tell me about it. - May I? Let's listen what they have to say. Well, hello! I kiss the hand! We never had this much cash. 30 million dollars. We could also take out a 10 million commercial loan. We put it into new internet companies. Right! I need you to tell me what this internet is. Right! Do you have a moment? - It's quite complicated. - Don't bother then. How much can we make? In six months we'll get 300%? Maybe 500% profit. Why do we need the factory? Screw those Korean machinery. We need to make money and not tableware! There goes my portrait! That is a very good question! Once you're on the financial market or the new technology market, you don't have to do anything. I like the sound of that. No employees no unions, no social security, no machinery, no monthly wages. Exactly! Millions! Or even billions of zeroes in our accounts! While we're trying to lay off 1500 workers we have this guy here, Wacław Trojan and his "internets". With 500% profit. And that's what they call restru… Restructuring. This is how they do it in the West. So? Are we in? We can sell our factory to our competitors. Let them sell it off. Is someone interested? Certainly. I put my ear to the ground. They want to take over our market share. They'll pay us 100 million easily. That is what I like to hear. You're my wizard! That's even better than cutting newspapers. It used to be newspapers, now it's the "internets". That is the bomb, gentlemen! Hello, Marzena. I have two pieces of news. Which one first? The good one. You won't have to commute anymore! - Is that the good one? - The better one. We're closing our design division. But why? Automatization. What? Are the machines going to design? It'll increase our efficiency. Our goal is to reduce employment completely. Bączek will kick you out as well. I don't think so. - May I? - Yes, go ahead. What did they do to this country… Open up! Monsieur Poniatowski! You have visitors! Vous… what? Visitors! I'm coming. All French sounds the same. Oh my God! Monsieur Poniatowski! - Let me say, that... - Filip! Come here! ...that this property is seized by court order. They're bothering me again! I told you I don't understand them! Easy, easy! We'll settle this. Can you lend me a twenty? The girls need bus tickets to Poland. I'm not going to break a 500! Merci! What the… - Do something! - We still want our money. Kazik, what have you done? He seizes everything in debt. I told you not to take out a loan against the company's assets! There goes your vacation resort! There goes the caviar and toilet paper on the company! The house belongs to the company and it's being impounded. You should've bought it without anybody knowing! So now it would be yours. Now you're the smart one? What's next? What's next? You'll put on the cheapest clothes and pack the cheapest suitcase. They'll take the rest. I told you! Come on, girls! Maybe we'll get lucky at the ATM. Monsieur Poniatowski! You can put on... this. What is he saying? Sir? We were supposed to have luck. That's it. Wacek! They're repossessing my house! It's the company's vacation resort! You took out a loan against the company's assets to buy internet companies. So sell those! And pay off the loan! What are you talking about? Don't you watch the news? You haven't heard? I don't understand a word! Everything is in French here! The internet-bubble burst. Our investments didn't pan out. How much is left? Nothing. Did you get the money out? Of course. The crash was obvious. Bączek will never know. I got something left! The insolvency administrator will sell us the factory for a fraction. And we'll sell it to the Germans. I hope you were right in your cash-flow estimates for the next 15 years. We need an honest estimation. Don't be too curious. You might've been a player once, but those days are gone. Now you're just an errand boy. You'll be fine. Just… Don't pretend to be the puppet master. Right. I know the situation. Sabrina! Well, hello? - I'm in trouble. - Talk to Magda about it. You're a good fit. Or ask Filip for a new whore! I need you! - I really do. - You're several years late. That's life. You win some, you lose some. Your glasses! How much to the airport? It's paid for, boss. I will be back here. I'll be waiting! Bon voyage! Now you sound like a human being. Let's go! And you said he forgot about us! - After so many years of silence? Never stop believing! Look! Over here! - Hasn't changed a bit! - What are you doing? Waiting for you, boss! Arrivals are upstairs! This is departures! My favorite idiots! No suitcase. This is it. Right, gentlemen. Let's go to Włocławek. I told you this bankruptcy is a front! The boss has a plan! Right, up his sleeve. It'll be fine. - Who are you here to see? - Show some respect! He's the CEO. You're apparently new. It's my name on the door. K. Poniatowski! That's true! They just dropped some letters. NIATO. - Good! The creditors will be confused. - Shut it! Do you know this gentleman? Small time currency dealer Kazimierz Bączek. He claims to be CEO. This is the CEO. That traitor Trojan! Shall I kick him out? No. I'll walk him out. Come on. What about you? What are you up to? Me? I need to make a living. Bend the knee and serve former criminals. It's like Chicago in the 1930s. Old man Kennedy, the president's father, made money from smuggling whisky. - Just like Al Capone. - Al Capone. Good luck, Kazik. Good luck, colonel. General. My name is Włodek. Hello, darling! Can I stay at your place? Now you're here? How often did you invite me to that palace? How often? The New Year's Eve-party? That's once! Once in all those years! I lost my job because of you! You ran a decent factory into the ground! Ruined people's lives! You're a low-life. She's right. I didn't get my severance pay. So I took it. What about us? It's too late for "Us". Maybe you should see Sabrina? Nice flowers though! Stop staring, you morons! Let's go to Poznań! Mind your tone! Give him his rags! I knew you had no plan! Boss… Mum! There's someone here to see you. Let him in. He's your father. Krysia… I… I know. I know all about it. Can I stay the night? I have nowhere to go. Is a two-bedroom apartment good enough? After your 40 bedrooms in France where you never invited us! You were ashamed of us! Always ashamed! You never needed us and you think I don't know that? - You're right. I messed up. - You did. Big time. But go ahead. You can sleep in the kitchen. After all this is your registered address. You're all grown up. Thanks, dad. Get up! Why? You'll help out at the café. And no more drinking. And no more shady deals. Go to work, like before. Like you used to. Once in a while you'd cheat some sucker. Everyone was happy. I will change. You have no choice. Put your wedding ring on. So everything looks normal. Do you have a change of clothes? We need to buy you some. I have one oversized t-shirt you can use. Thanks, son. How much do we have? Don't touch the money. We had a deal. Just trying to help. You're scheming! I wouldn't! I'm as innocent as a baby! You go to the bank, darling. I'll lock up. Can we still get some ice-cream? Kazik? Karol Lis! Dear God! Kazimierz Bączek! You're back together with Krysia? I heard about your problems. What problems? The bankruptcy, the liquidator… And other things. It ain't easy, brother. Think I care about liquidation? Let them write. Let me show you something. Come on. See that? - It's a logo. - It's a front. Soon all will be revealed. "Kazik's shady deals"? It'll say "Danish Ice-cream" I just bought a factory. Ice-cream factory? Big deal… Can we still get something? We're out of ice-cream and out of coffee, but there's cake. Dorota as I remember her. Who's gonna buy your ice-cream? Arabs! 400 million Arabs around the world. They live in a hot climate. North Africa, Persian Gulf. They long for ice-cream! Even Bedouin on their camels will buy my ice-cream. I have market research. In Poland ice-cream is nothing. Over there they never go out of season! They're like penguins! Cold is a luxury for them. Dubai. Egypt. Morocco. That's where the business is. International deals. Franchise. He's got a mind for business. Unlike you, my present ex. Do you want in? How much can we make? For starters I can guarantee 400 percent return. When we enter the African market I can offer you 800 percent. Now that is brilliant! It's what Posnania made! That's right. We need to think about it. We'll be in touch. The more you invest, the better the conditions. Think about that. I need to make a cash report. Come on, son. Darling, are we in? Sure thing we are! We can't get 6% out of our dealerships. If it wasn't for tax evasion we would lose money. Should we tell him? Are you stupid? Let him wait. He might think we're desperate. He needs to think we're doing great. And that we're in the mood for investing… A million dollars. One million dollars? That's all we have! He has a knack for this, but that's too risky! He needs to think we have ten million in cash and another ten million in real estate. We invest a million, but we want the best conditions and priority over all others. As if we invested ten. He needs to believe we can up the stakes. He will believe that. Just keep your mouth shut. Kazik! We'll get going. Number seven! Are you paying and staying? How much is it? How much do you have? The thug has 10 000! Lovely! It's all there! Three hours for you. Please take care of the gentleman. Right. What else do we have? He's got another 30 minutes. Boss, I have a customer. Well done. Oh, the minister! Hello, sir! The opposition pays up-front. Ten grand. That'll get you four hours. Come on through! Have fun! There's also an old friend. Kazik! You? Here? You talked about retiring to the sun and now you have to run your business? It ain't easy, you know. I'm not letting anyone in without 10 000$. You know how it is. I have a strong working ethic. I'm not going to retire. I'll work until the end of my days. Or longer. How are your customers doing? De Niro? Polanski? Solvent. Listen. I have a business proposition. Everyone has. Danish ice-cream for Arabs. A factory in Marrakesh. For starters. Kazik! You're broke! Don't try to fool me. I was there when they took everything! I have a brain. And an idea. I just need customers. I'm a bit short on cash now. What about your customers? Let's sell them investment certificates. That's a good idea. Let's sit down and talk. Go on, take a seat. It's very comfy. Brought it from Monaco. You know, tomorrow… So good you're here! Feel how soft they are! I'm at the president's reception tomorrow. With all the big fish from the real estate business. You wouldn't believe the shit they pull. They swim in money. See? That's what I need. If this works out we'll buy you a Formula 1 team. There's a track in Marrakesh. There isn't. That's even better. We can build one. Really Cold Danish Ice-cream Danish? We're in Poland! Krysia Bączek's delicious ice-cream! Everything is clear. Krysia! Danish ice-cream is as good as their fjords! Trust me. I know how to do business. Let's swap the signs. Swap? You had it all planned? Be careful! Don't ruin it! Careful! A bit to the right. So it's centered. That's about right. Nobody will understand this. That's the deal! Pay the guys. This way. Thank you! Thank you for your trust. That's a good investment. There's more coming. Busy as a market on Saturday. Say hi, chicks! Good day! There's our vixen! Hello! Hello, Komar! Girls! We don't need you for this investors. Go back to your pen. Shoo! I see you run a brothel! It's not a brothel. It's an exclusive escort service. I'm no pimp. - Here, Kazik. - Nice family feuds! Like the old times! That's pretty. Who's the author? That's IKEA. Did you have to paint it yourself? Why so little? That's 1,2 million dollars! All we have. All the spare cash we have. We invested the rest in securities and real estate in Marbella. In Spain. That's 1,2 million now. The goal is to invest 10 million. We aim at high returns. The first pool is a hundred million. The faster we can fill it, the faster the revenue will flow. Simple. Maybe we should sell the house in Poznań? And the other, near the lake? We'll receive money from our securities in a month. If we get preferential conditions now, we'll invest nine more millions. Any other deal we're not interested in. We have a deal. - Great! - I'll trust you. Thank you. There's some champagne left… Let's drink this first. Maybe some beef tartare? Like the old days? WELCOME It's a rather daring picture in a very original style. Good day! Hi! Yes, hi. We'll think about it. I see the gentleman is very interested. - But… - Vamos! Good-bye! Are you crazy? You could've waited! You know how hard it is to sell anything! I saw him! Them! They're scheming again! - What "them"? - Bączek! Komar! Lis, his wife and even that secret police guy! They're together again! We talked about this a thousand times! The past… We put it behind us and start new. - I know. - Right. And what do you do? Follow Bączek and his team around? You're not a cop anymore! You can't do anything about it! They're meeting again! Do you want me to walk away? I do. Just walk away. People were killed. Your husband was killed. That reporter, Kulesza! And you tell me to walk away? I won't. No! I won't walk away from this! Not even if you… - If I do what? - Nothing. - Hi, dad! - Hi! What's his problem? Always the same. He can't let it go. What will you do about it? I don't know. I just don't know. You're right. I need to do something. Your dad will go crazy. Hello. Marzena speaking. I know it's been a long time. We need to talk. I know how Antek died. I know about everything. No, don't be afraid. We just need to pay some debts. I need your help. You can count on me. I knew it wouldn't be long! Another con? Cutting newspapers again? That's clean cash. It'll last you a lifetime. It's for you. My real family. What are you up to? I need to scheme. Pretend. Make shady deals. It's in my nature. I'm sorry for everything. Son. Here's my Rolex. For good luck. Kazik! Are you back together with this Sabrina? I… I would never! Catch! The car's yours. Son! We need to change the sign. So the police won't bother us. Looking for your father. Really Cold Danish Ice-Cream. Mum! I'm waiting here. Kazik! I'm sorry. I couldn't make up my mind! My love! Kazimierz Poniatowski. Like the prince. And Sabrina Wilk. How's our factory doing? It's better than I expected! We're in contact with the Nigerian government and we're pushing phase two. Not just Arab countries, but all of Africa! Hear that? That's the 800% profit! - I told you to mortgage the houses! - Stop it! There's 200 million people in Nigeria. Did you know that? And we'll have the ice-cream monopoly there! And the best thing? They'll pay us in oil! How about that! Filip! You'll be able to… To pay for this Senna to drive for you! Ayrton Senna died in 1993. Some other Kubica then. Call the national oil company and negotiate terms! Why do we need Kubica? We have Komar! Kazik! We're running with the big boys now! Posnania was little-league! We need cash! Here's the deal. Mortgage the houses and sell off securities. We need money in our accounts. Hold on a moment! How do we know we can trust you? Show some trust! Move your hand! Dorota is cautious. That's good. I respect that. You'll get hard proof. How "hard"? This is Dikembe Mutombo and Emmanuel Amunike. The Nigerian minister and vice-minister for natural resources. Big fish. Wave back! - Say what? - She wants to lick it. - Like in brothel? - I'm in. Kazik! Did I hear "brothel"? Listen, we need more money to increase production. Can you send something today? What about our returns? When will we see some returns? In a month. Two months tops. I just need Filip to secure those 15 million dollars by tomorrow. Can you do that? I'll try to hurry the investors. I need to get going. Here's a picture of our factory in Marrakesh. Who's the guy in the back? My trusted advisor. Construction supervisor. The man is pure gold. Right. See you! Leave it! A sunny car for sunny days. Poznań, 2004 I need a loan first. What about a deposit then? As a reservation. I'll be in touch. It's hopeless. And? Did Kazik call you? He didn't. And did you call him, you genius? I did. He said there's been a slight delay. Slight delay? A slight delay is what we called it two months ago! He's up to no good! I know him! Why do you look at me? I'm not going to Marrakesh! Bloody Kazik! Can't even pay the mechanic. Hello? Please be patient. It's all temporary. The money is on a ship. As oil. On a tanker. Yes, I'll urge the unloading party. There you go, chicks! Peck away! No customers and none coming. They're all pissed. Kazimierz took all their money. Hello? Yes, of course! Kazimierz is building new factories! I do remember. Peck away! Hello! Kazik? Thank God you're calling! They want to rip my head off! They want their money back. They don't care about returns! They want their money and they want it from me! You took so much money I'd have to run a brothel the size of a McDonald's to pay them back! I'm sending you some pictures. Take a look. That's Dubai. Cairo. Lagos and Tripoli are coming up. And then there's this. As a bonus. Nigerian ministers are sending another transport. This should calm our investors. One more thing, my friend. I'm going to France next week. To buy back our family seat! It'll be like the old days! See you there! You never said you're buying back the palace! I wanted it to be a surprise! Will you join me? I'd love to, but I need to go to Poland and settle a matter I should've settled a long time ago. What matters are so pressing? It's a surprise. See you in Dijon! I love you! It's pouring like crazy. Here's every one of his scams. He always was crafty but now he has outdone himself. No customers, no factories, no oil and no contracts. Everything is a scam. A pyramid scheme. What good is it if he's still in Morocco? We can't get him there. He'll just stay put. That's why I'm here. He'll be in France next Tuesday. He wants to buy back the palace in Dijon. That's enough. So we're even? Will you be able to forgive me for Antek's death and you losing everything? I was trying to find my daughter. I was being blackmailed. I had no idea she was dead. I forgave you long ago. This is not about me. It's about Wojtek. He won't rest until he gets Bączek I want to spend the time we have left with him. I really hope you too will find your place. You and your dad can give me a scare. Do you have dirt on Bączek? And I know when and how to get him. Bonjour! Flowers for your master? Yes, sir. Thank you. Come on! They must be nuts! Polish police in France? Maciejak! Think you're still with the force? Oh Bączek! You want the force? There it is! Start the engine! You're under arrest! You have no right! What is that? Leave me alone! Let's go! Kazik is never going to change! How will I pay everyone back?
