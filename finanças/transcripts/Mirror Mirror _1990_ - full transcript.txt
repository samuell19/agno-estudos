Here let me help you. It's stuck. - Let's try this. Now pull! - Look at all this junk. - What do we have here? Poor old soul! Locked up alone in this house all those years. - I don't think you're gonna get much for this. Be careful with that! - The new owners move in tomorrow and there's still so much more to do. Don't you worry, hunny... I'll see that everything is out of here by then. Oh look! She kept a diary. - Diary? Oh that's fascinating... Oh, crazy as a loon you know... Poor old soul, God bless her. - Now I'm late! I have an appointment on the westside and I still have to pick up the babysitter. - Well don't you worry, I'll take care of this mess. You go on ahead. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure! Go on! God bless. - Yes... Well thank you! Hmm... Oh! When you're finished loadingbring everything to my store... The address is on this card... And I'll meet you there. Now the house is still in good shape, Mrs. Gordon. But since you've decided to move in so quickly... I took the liberty of asking the cleaning crew... to stay on a few days to help out. Now most everything is done... except for the living room... And they should be done with that in a couple weeks! - Megan... Don't you just love it here? - I loved it where we were. - So much bigger when it's empty. Come on boys! Is... uh... there an ashtray someplace? Oh... there must be. Megan please stand up straight. You know... I get such a strong feeling from this house. I think... Everything is going to be different now. - Where's my room? - I hope you don't mind this heat wave we're having. What did I tell you? See! This room is perfect for you. Don't you think so, Mrs. Perfili? - Yes, it is. Oh I'm sorry... I thought all that had been taken away. - You don't want that in your room. Of course not! I'll make sure someone comes to pick it up. - It looks like it belongs here. - It's part of the Weatherworth estate. - I like it. Well... if it's alright with your mother I could arrange for you to buy it. - Let's just look at the rest of the house. - Can I? - What? Fine. Get out! - I uh... think you're gonna like your new school, Megan. It's the best private school in the state! - I don't believe this. - Alright, so... Her father owns his own advertising company... I mean the guy's a bigshot. - Well he must think she's running for president of the United States then... Just look at this. - Come on what are you worried about? What are you worried about? - I'm worried about winning, Ron! - Alright, can I say something? You know what... you know what's wrong? With you... - No, please tell me. - I will, I'll give it right to you. It's... it's... It's your priorities. See, I should be the most important thing in your life. - Oh... - Me. - Now I'm really worried. - Look, you are gonna be a great president... and everybody knows that... A great little president... great dictator. Look, what, what does Charleen got? Nothing... she's... Nice knockers and that's it! - Don't look at her boobs! - Nikki! I saw your posters... They're... cute. - And I saw yours, Charleen... they're uh... big. - Kim is handling everything. - Oh how nice. What's next, Kim? Uh... billboards all over town? - No, that won't be necessary. I have a much better idea. - What idea is that? You're not gonna wear a bra from now on? - That wouldn't be fair to Nikki. - Girls. Oh my god! - Sorry... I'm late. Let me... take a wild guess... You're the new student from L.A.? Admission slip? Please. Come, come, come, come. Give me a break... punk is out! Megan Gordon. Take a seat. Oh she killed him! - She's already dressed for a funeral. - Could I have a little quiet please! I'm trying to teach a class here... - I'll get her. - Hey you shouldn't take it personally, those guys would laugh at plane crashes. Seriously, you shouldn't give a shit about this. My name's Nikki Chandler. - Hi. - Hi. - I brought youyour things. - Thanks. - Sure. You moved into the Weatherworth house didn't you? I babysit for Mrs. Perfili. Look, why don't you give me your schedule and I can show you where your classes are? Here we go. Hmm... Well we've got gym together. Come on let's go. My parents are divorced... and uh... I live with my dad... And he works a lot... And when he's not working all he does is watch TV. He's a real nutcase. - You should meet my mom. - How long have your parents been divorced? It's your serve. - Ok! - My dad died four months ago. - I'm sorry... - Yea... - Why'd you guys move out here? - My mom's psychiatrist advised it. - Psychiatrist? Sounds very Beverly Hills. - Yea... my is... very, very Beverly Hills. Ok, everybody in! Into Algebra... - No, I'm not feeling better Doctor Tobin... I'm still not sleeping well at night... and my head hurts all the time! And I'm hot... I just feel kinda hot! How do I know how the dogs are adjusting, Dr. Tobin? I've only had them two weeks! Megan's fine. I know she's shy. Doctor... I'm trying to tell you how I feel! Really? Don't you think it's a little soon to just... Make new friends? I have kept the evil locked in the mirror... Ever since that night... I can trust no one. They would think I'm insane... and maybe I am. Hmm... Tortured soul. I must control my thoughts and refuse to use its power. I have tried in vain to destroy it. Only to find it returns. Oh Mrs. Perfili how nice to see you again! - I uh... brought the auction papers on the Weatherworth estate. - That'll save me a trip. How about a cup of tea! - Oh I have to run... Oh, uh... That old mirror... that we pulled out of the closet? - Yes? - Well it got left behind and my clients daughter liked it. - Hmm... that's funny I thought I saw them unload that... Well I must be mistaken. - I told her I'd arrange something. - Don't you worry honey I'll take care of it. - Thank you. Here's Mrs. Gordon's phone number. I'm sorry... um... I really do have to run. - Well come again, for tea next time! We can chat. - Sure! I'd like that. - Hey Nikki, where's your new friend? - What is your problem, Charleen! What's yours? Getting a little desperate for votes? - Shitheads! - You know, Nikki, I... I... I saw her... and um... she does look... a little strange. You know? - Look. Mrs. Perfili asked me to show her around... Besides... I like her. - Oh... it's... it's... ok. Fine... I just don't want it to turn into another one of your noble... lost causes. You know? Alright! Alright... - I'm home! I'm home. I found him just lying there when... when I went upstairs. At first I thought he was sleeping. - Why'd you put him there? - First your father, now this? - It's not the same thing. - I thought of it as a person. - Take him off the counter. - Take him off the counter? Is that all you can say? You never liked him did you? Well he liked you! Didn't you honey? Yes? - Hello, I'm from the Happy Valley Pet Cemetary. - Oh... Right this way. - I wish Daddy were here. I hate you! You're ugly! - Megan... Meggy? Don't be afraid... It's me. - Daddy? - Yes, honey. I missed you so much. - I've missed you too. - It's alright... I'm here with you. What happened to me, Meggy? - What? - Where was I? - Daddy, I... Daddy, that hurts! What have you done to me! - Why are you torturing me! Stop! You're hurting me! Let go! Let go... - Meggy. Come to me. Megan! - Go away! Megan! Megan! - I saw Daddy. - You were having a nightmare, Megan. - But he was here. - Megan, your father's dead. He couldn't be here. Dead people neve rcome back! Now go to sleep, Megan. It was just a nightmare. I'm sorry! - No, I'm sorry. It was my fault. - No, I've been really out of it today. - I know what you mean. Here you go. We'll both try to be more carefil next time. Oh... - Thanks. - See you around. Ted! Honey... Does... this look like a peep show? - It sure looks like a peep show to me. Come on, Megan, let's go before they give us VD or something. - Say something! - Nikki, I wouldn't give you VD if you paid me for it. - Good, give it to Charleen. - Is that all you can think of to say? - Will you give it a rest? Come on. - You like him don't you? - No! - Megan! He's cute. Look at you though, you're blushing. - I am not! - They met me in the day of success... and I have learned by Prefect's report. They have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I first... - That's a really weird dream. - I know... It seemed so real though! - I used to have dreams about my parents getting back together all the time. - See... I've had dreams about... about my dad but... They were never like this. - Maybe it was a Weatherworth ghost. - To question them further... - What are you talking about? - I'm just kidding. - What? - There's just rumors... - What kind of rumors? - You don't believe in that shit do you? I don't know... it's like Mary Weatherworth was supposed to be into witchcraft or something like that... and... it was something about... her sister dying... and disappearing and no one being able to find her... and they say that after that Mary never left the house because she said it was haunted. I don't know it was a long time ago. - That does it! Mrs. Davis! - Come on! Stop! I'll check into his file. I need it by Friday. - So what did she say? - Not to do it again. - Same here. - Hey, could we get out of here? This room makes me nervous. - Let's go. - Where? - There. - What do I do with it? - Make something! - I'm not an artist. - Well look I have to finish this by next week for a class, so... You might as well hangout and test your talents. Have fun! You know I... I... I don't know... I think... I think that I'm a lot better looking... than this, you know? - Yea? - Yea. Now look. - You know what you're right. - See? - Yea. Um... I think it's the skull, Ron, I think it's too big for your small brain. - That's funny. Well I'll just go to the kitchen and I'll just do my... own art... Art de cuisine. - Oh, good! - You're really good! - Thanks. Come on, get over there. Come on. Sit down... - I don't know where to start... - Just move it around! You know... try to play with it a little bit. Pretty soon it's gonna start to look like something and then after that you tell people that's what you were going for in the first place. - Megan! There you are. This is Mr. Veze. I've invited him to dinner. You certainly seem dedicated... to your profession... Mr. Veze. - I really love animals, Mrs. Gordon. Pets are people too. - Call me Susan. - Bill. Must be really hard raising daughter alone these days. - It's a very hard time for me just now. - I can understand. - Would you like some more potatoes, Bill? - Thank you. - God! Is something wrong? - I think I better go. I must be having flashbacks again. I was in Vietnam, you know? - No... I didn't. Why don't you just come with me into the living room and we'll sit awhile. Maybe it'll make you feel better... - No, no... - I think I better go. Sometimes they last for awhile. Oh! Thank you for the dinner. - I'll walk you to the door. Maybe he didn't like the wig, what do you think? - Don't you think it's a little soon to start dating? - Why be old fashioned? I think it's important to make new friends. - What about your old friends? - How about... desert? - I'm not hungry. - Fine. I'm tired. - Goodnight. Alright, besides water polo... we will work on developing your skilll as a swimmer... and also on your stamina. Now there will be extra credit for those of you who do laps after school. And everyone here will be expected to participate. No questions? Ok. Kim, Lisa... choose your teams. - Charleen. Nikki. Wendy. - Wendy! Kathy. - Pick Megan. - Mmm mm. - Come on! - Tina... - Tina! - Come on. - Jaqueline. - Ursula. - Susan. Well, Kim? Looks like Megan's on your team. - Why not Lisa's team! Now that's enough! Both teams, into the water. Now. During the witch trials witnesses claimed to have seen demons... called up by witches to aid them in their evil deeds. Mirrors were used to create a gateway to the other side... Allowing the demons to enter our world. By granting wishes and desires... these demons would seduce one into using its power... at which point one would fall prey to the demon's evil bidding. A black cloth was used... to block reflection and void the creatures power. - Don't forget to vote for Charleen. It's nice of you to stop by. - We have to stop by here... it's the only way into the cafeteria. - I know, that's why I'm here. - Oh a party! I love parties. What's the occasion? - It's just a little get together I'm having. - Why are you inviting us? - Well let's not let this stupid election get in the way of our friendship. Balloon? Oh... It's you. - Look Megan, we're invited to a party. Thanks, Kim. We'll be there. - Yea... we'll be there. - Oh my God. - Come on, Charlotte. Keep it down, she can hear you. - Oh so what! We're just joking around... what's the big deal? - Exactly! What's the big deal? Let's go. - I'm not done with my lunch. What's this? I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding! Somebody help me! Help me! - Somebody call the nurse! - Somebody call the nurse! - I don't understand what happened? Stop it! What is there to bark about? There's nothing in there. Look. See! There's nothing to be concerned about, ok? Now. Go downstairs. - Ghosts... do not... exist. And nose bleeds happen every day. Charleen is gonna be fine. Unfortunately. - I felt something. Like... an eye or someone... or Something was... controlling it... making it happen. - Hmm, I felt something too... Like projectile vomiting... I was trying to eat my lunch. - That's not what I meant. - Well you know what... I believe you though, Megan, I do. Why don't we try it out... why don't you try to make something happen... right now? Like turning yourself into a normal person, that would be good wouldn't it? - Ron! - I'm... you know... I feel like I'm getting chicken pox... - Like... I just... I'm out of here. - I'll be right back. - Like... I told you... she is whacked! She thinks that she's like a... lead in a horror flick or something. - Say goodbye. - Bye, Megan! Call me when she leaves, ok? I'll come right back. I'll come right back if you call me first. - Bye! - He thinks I'm crazy. - I think you're crazy. I just felt like... I could have stopped it if I wanted to. - Megan, stop! Look... dreams are not reality! You're thinking about this too much. Can we study now? Ok, look... here are my notes for the test tomorrow... and um... all you have to do is label the different parts of the body. - You sure you guys wanna go through with this, huh? - What do you think, we went to all this trouble for nothing? I just don't see what you have against this girl. - Why not! This is a joke for God sakes. It's not like we're gonna cover him in pig's blood or anything. - Why don't you just leave her alone? - Every body else thought it was a good idea. - We're just having a little fun. Come on. - Shhh. - Put your notes away! Clear your desks. There will be no talking. If you talk you will fail. Oh my God... I hope this isn't the start of a new trend. What's your problem? - I don't have a problem. - Sure you do. You just don't have a solution. - If he gets more than that... she hasn't got a clue. - Girls. Help. Help. Help. - Somebody help him! - What's going on! - I don't know. - What happened! - Get out of the way! - Stand back. - Hold that tight. Alright, take it easy. Take a deep breath. Ok, that's it. Go on to your next class. - What do you think? Maybe I found the real me? - You don't know who the real you is and neither do I. - Aren't we a little bit grumpy? I'm going to the store, Megan! Do you want me to pick you up some Mydol? - Oh... hello! I handle the Weatherworth estate. Oh, it's so hot. Mind if I come in? - What can I do for you? - Well I just stopped by to pickup something that was left here by mistake. - Mistake? - A mirror. It belongs to the estate but I can take it off your hands. - No! I can't let you have that. - Oh? Why not? - It's mine now. - Oh, you don't want that mirror. Why don't you come by my shop... and we'll pick you out a better one. - I like this one. - Maybe if I could speak to your mother? - My mother's not home and I'm busy, if you'll excuse me. Leadership.

Or... we'll stay here and it'll have all your favorites like I used to. - Ok, if you want. - Megan? I realize I haven't been there for you lately. I want things to get better between us. - I'm glad you're feeling better. - Nikki, what are you doing! Come on stop hiding from me again, I don't like it. There you are, come on let's go do something. - Look, maybe some other time, Megan. - Nikki, you've been avoiding me all day. Why? - Just leave me alone. Ok? - Nikki, I'm in control of it. - I don't wanna hear this, Megan. - No, Nikki, really! Nikki, listen! No! Nikki... I can control it now. - Megan what's happening? Help. - See... Controlled. I can stop it. And I can start it. - Stop! - Nikki. The rumors are true... There is something haunting the Weatherworth house... Only it's not a ghost! It gave me powers... and those powers can be for you too, Nikki. If you want it. Nikki, that's... that's why Charleen... I did it for you. And Jeff... I just got careless... and that was stupid of me! - Jeff? You know where he is? - Nikki... You're my best friend. I need to know that you're with me... and not against me. Come on let's go do something. - I really gotta go. - Tomorrow! - Yea... tomorrow... - Nikki, call me later? - Sure... Kim? Now it's time for you and me to have a little talk. - Thank you, it's about time, I almost started doing homework. - I'm sorry... Um... - Are you alright? - Can I borrow your car? - Why what's wrong? - I can't explain now, can I borrow the car please? Go to the house and wait for me. - Well look, Nikki, you want me to come with you? I'll come with you. - No, just go to my house and wait, please... - Be careful, ok? Slow down. My mom only insures me. Ok? - Oh, Nikki! - Hi. - Did we uh... get our schedules crossed? I don't need you to babysit tonight. - Oh no, Mrs. Perfili, there's no mixup. Um... I need to ask you about something. - What is it? - Um... Well... I need to know about the Weatherworth house. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Megan! - Um... - I was just on my way downstairs to cook you that meal I promised. I haven't even asked you how you like your new school. We'll talk over... calll you when it's ready. - Come on. Can I just talk to you for a second? Please? - We're closed. - I'm sorry but it's really important. - Well... can you make it quick? I'm not feeling well. - It was Eilizabeth who brought up the demon... and opened the gate. When she used it's power... The mirror controlled her. Mary killed her sister because of it. She thought that would stop it. - Look I'm calling the police. - No, that won't do any good. And if what you just told me is true... it could get us both killed. - How do I stop her? - It's not your friend we have to stop. The mirror is using her. She doesn't know what she's unleashed. We have to try to make her understand the dangers... And help us! We have to close the opening. And I think I know how. Here... take this. Oh don't worry. It's not for your friend. It's for whatever is in that mirror. Now... Be careful. It'll try to trick you. And it can read your thoughts, and remember... Don't... ask it for anything. I'll meet you there. Wait, you have to come with me... I don't know what to do. There's somebody I want to bring along... Just don't go inside until I get there. - I think I've someone I wanna bring along too. - Hello? I need to speak to Father Jeffries. No, no I can't hold! - This is Father Jeffries, can I help you? Hello? Hello? Hello? - Ladies and gentlemen... If you notice his absolute concentration. That's incredible... did you see that? Did any body see that? That splash of yellow between the salami and the meatloaf... that was incredible! That was... great. The crowd's going crazy... Mayo... Mayo! Mayo! Ok... Oh ladies and gentlemen... May I say... At this time... I may now die a happy man. Nick? Nikki? Nikki? Nikki? Nick? Nikki! Nikki! Nick! Nikki, please let this be you. Jesus! Nikki! Jesus. Breath! Breath! Breath! - I'm ok. I'm ok... Stop. - Don't, don't don't try to talk. - I'm ok! - I'll take you to the hospital. - I'm ok. I'm ok. - What the hell is going on! Woah, Nikki... I see that you're feeling better but why don't you let me take you to the hospital, ok? - In a minute. Oh, Nick... cut it out! Easy... easy. Oh, Nikki, slow down. - Ron! - Ron? Good. Oh... - Ron! No! No! Help! Somebody help! - Hi, Nikki. - Megan... - I've been waiting for you to call. - Why are you doing this! - Come on Nikki... I'm the only friend you need. Nikki... I want you to come over here. I'll be waiting. And Nikki... That silly old woman from the antique store... She won't be joining us. - Megan? Megan! - What is it? - Honey your supper's ready. - I'm not hungry. - Well you have to eat, you know? - Just go away. - I'll be downstairs if you need me. I love you, Megan. - Mom? Mom, wait. Mom? Mom? Mom! Baldar... - Mom! Mom! Megan... It won't open! No not her! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Help me! Megan... - Megan! Megan? Megan? Megan... Megan, I'm here. I've decided to join you. It's just you... and me. You're right, we don't... we don't need anybody else. So this is where all the power comes from. I can't breath. - No! - There's nothing you can do. Meggy... Meggy... - What's it doing? Meggy... - It wants you, Nikki. Nikki... - Stay away from me, Megan. - That won't help you. No, run, Nikki! - Megan, stop it! - I don't know how. - Open the front door! - Hold on! - Open it! - God! - Let us out, Megan! Is there still a way out? - Hold on! - Come on! Leave her! - No! - Let's get out of here! No! Megan! No... Megan? Oh God! Oh... God... God... Meggy...
