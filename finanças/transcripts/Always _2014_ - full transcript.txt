A CONTAINER OF CIGARETTES IS WORTH 2.4 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS. IN FACT, THEIR FACTORY IN CHINA CAN PRODUCE ONE CONTAINER A WEEK. WITH THE MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE FROM THE IPO, THEY INTEND TO OPEN THREE FACTORIES. DO I NEED TO ASK YOU HOW MUCH RUTLEDGE INTENDS TO MAKE IN A YEAR OUT OF CIGARETTES? SO, WHAT'S THE CATCH? WE'RE ON SHAKY GROUND AS TO WHETHER IT CAN GO THROUGH OR NOT. WELL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO KEEP MORE OF RUTLEDGE'S PERSONAL VIEWS UNDER WRAPS, I THINK THAT TRAIN'S ALREADY LEFT THE STATION. NO ONE CARES ABOUT RUTLEDGE'S RACIST RANTS OR HIS ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL TANGENTS. WE'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS GRANDSON, EARL. WHAT ABOUT HIM? WELL, A FEW MONTHS AGO HE WAS OUT IN XI'AN ON A TOUR. LONG STORY SHORT ONE OF THE GIRLS DID NOT GET BACK ON THE BUS. A FEW OF THE TOURISTS SAID THAT SHE WAS LAST SEEN WITH HIM AND THE LOCAL POLICE TOOK HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING, BUT LUCKILY HE WAS RELEASED AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE EMBASSY. SO WHAT'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE IPO? WELL, LAST WEEK THEY FOUND WHAT WE THINK ARE HER REMAINS NEAR THE SITE. THEY'RE DOING A DNA TEST NOW BUT SOME ENTERPRISING JOURNALIST HAS ALREADY CONNECTED THE DOTS BETWEEN THE GRANDSON AND THE CEO. SHE WANTS TO CALL A HALT TO THE IPO UNTIL HE'S EXTRADITED TO CHINA TO FACE MURDER CHARGES. SHE'LL KILL THE IPO PRESS IF SHE DOES. THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE KEEP HER QUIET. THIS IS A HUGE ACCOUNT FOR THIS COMPANY AND NOT TO MENTION YOUR BONUSES. HONESTLY, WE ARE MAXED OUT ON OUR WORKLOAD. LIAM, LIAM, I DO NOT LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING. HEY OLI, OLI, OLI, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. FANTASTIC. HEY, LIAM, YOU STILL THERE? YEAH. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? YEAH, I KNOW. HE'S SUCH A DIRT RAG. HEY, LISTEN, I COULD TAKE THIS ONE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT. NO. NO. YOU GOT THE LAST ONE. - I'LL SET UP THE MEETING. - ALL RIGHT. USUAL TONIGHT? SURE. HEY, THANKS FOR COVERING ME TODAY. HEY, NO PROBS. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE. I JUST NEED TO TAKE CARE OF SOME LONG OVERDUE ERRANDS. GREAT. CATCH YOU LATER THEN, BUD. CIAO. ALL DONE? I GOT TO GO. HOW SOON? I'M ALREADY LATE. DRINKS LATER? I'LL TEXT YOU IF I'M FREE. I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK YOU WEREN'T COMING. HEY, MISS MAO SAID YOU'RE LATE ON THE RENT AGAIN. I WILL HAVE IT SOON. I TOOK CARE OF IT. LIAM... IT'S DONE. IT FEELS LIKE ICICLES IN HERE. YOU'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN YOU READ BOOKS. THOSE'LL HAVE YOU BACK TO NORMAL. HOW'S WORK? IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO BE EXTRA SWAMPED WITH A CLIENT. WHICH ONE? RUTLEDGE TOBACCO. A CIGARETTE COMPANY? WHAT DO THEY WANT YOU TO DO FOR THEM? THE USUAL. BILL THEM FOR MY TIME. WELL DON'T WORK TOO HARD. YOU SHOULD REALLY MOVE IN WITH ME. I'D REMEMBER THAT SERVICE APARTMENT OF YOURS HAVING A SECOND BEDROOM. WHEN MY EXIT PACKAGE RUNS OUT. WE'LL GET A PLACE WITH AT LEAST TWO BEDROOMS. HMM. WE'LL SEE. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MEET ANYONE IF I'M LIVING WITH MY BABY BROTHER? WELL, THE ONLY REASON HE'S NEVER FACED TRIAL IS BECAUSE OF HIS POWERFUL GRANDFATHER. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SPECULATE ABOUT THIS KID'S GUILT. HE WAS THE LAST ONE SEEN WITH HER. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET DOWN TO THIS. THE COMPANY IS WILLING TO OFFER YOU SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE. OH, SO IS THIS WHAT YOU DO? SOMETIMES. MY GOD! AND YOU THINK I AM THAT EASY? NO, I DON'T THINK THAT. BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU A VIABLE WAY OUT. WHAT IF I DON'T WANT ONE? COME ON. YOU'RE DIGGING FOR SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE TRUE. WHAT'S THERE TO GAIN? IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS COVER-UP, JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE THEY CAN BE HIDING. LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR HERE... OH, RIGHT. DO YOU? YEAH. YEAH, SOME BIG TOBACCO COMPANY, THEY'RE RAISING MONEY FOR AN IPO, THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD SOME FACTORIES AND MAYBE PROMOTE LUNG CANCER, WHATEVER. OH, AND IT'S OKAY TO YOU TO JUST USE ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO GET WHAT YOU WANT? WHATEVER YOU THINK. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT DAVID DOESN'T WIN VERSUS GOLIATH HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD MEETING. MISS HONG. MISS, HONG LET'S TALK THIS OUT. WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT? YOU ALREADY SAID WHAT YOU THINK. YEAH, AND DON'T FAULT ME FOR THAT. LET'S SAY YOU WRITE THIS STORY OF YOURS, THEY'RE GOING TO STEAMROLL YOU AND ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT. COMES WITH THE TERRITORY, REALLY. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEN DO ME A FAVOR, GET SOME CONCRETE EVIDENCE FIRST. YEAH, I SURE WILL. EXCUSE ME. I WAS HERE FIRST. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T... SEE ME? RIGHT. I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE. WAIT! GREAT! NOW, LOOK WHAT YOU DID. ME? THE CAB STOPPED FOR ME. BECAUSE YOU COMPLETELY IGNORED ME AND WALKED IN FRONT OF ME. YOU KNOW WHAT? I SAID I'M SORRY. OH, DAMN! WHERE YOU GOING? CENTRAL. SO AM I. WE COULD TAKE THE FERRY. NO, THANKS. TECHNICALLY, IT SHOULD BE FASTER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. I CAN FIX THAT. I'M LIAM. YAN. YOU'RE NOT A FREAK, ARE YOU? WELL, I DID ALMOST TRY TO STEAL YOUR CAB. I'M KIDDING. I THINK IT'S THIS WAY. IT'S COLD OUT HERE. YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS. OH, NOW YOU WANT TO BE A GENTLEMAN? JUST TAKE IT. SO YOU NORMALLY ON THE DARK SIDE OF HONG KONG? KOWLOON? REALLY? I HAVE THIS NEW CLIENT TO MEET AND SHE INSISTED ON TST. WHAT A PAIN. NOW I GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO CENTRAL TO CATCH MY SEMINAR. ON WHAT? WINES. I LOVE WINE. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE? A BIG FAN OF RIESLINGS. KIND OF A SUNLAND GRAPE. I USED TO GO TO THIS WINERY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, THEY GOT REALLY GREAT RIESLINGS. SPATLESE? - AUSLESE. - TOO SWEET. I'M A LATE HARVEST CABERNET SORT OF GUY. YOU? GOT ONE? - YEAH. - COME ON. WELL, I DO HAVE THIS GREAT CHILDHOOD MEMORY OF A 1949 BORDEAUX. THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WINE. OH, QUITE. 20,000 30,000 HONGKIES. AT LEAST. YOU MUST COME FROM A RICH FAMILY. HARDLY. SO HOW DID YOU GET A TASTE OF ONE? WHILE I WAS WORKING FOR MY UNCLE AT HIS CONVENIENCE STORE IN NEW YORK, AND SOMEHOW THIS BOTTLE OF BORDEAUX GOT WRONGLY SHIPPED TO US. I'VE DECIDED TO OPEN IT THINKING NO ONE WOULD FIND OUT. SIX MONTHS LATER, MY UNCLE FOUND AN INVOICE. HE WAS SO ANGRY AT ME. IT TOOK ME TWO LONG SUMMERS TO PAY FOR IT. THAT'S A LONG TIME TO PAY FOR ONE BOTTLE OF WINE. WORTH EVERY SIP... IF ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME. SO, ARE YOU FROM NEW YORK? ORIGINALLY FROM SHANGHAI. OH! I FORGOT HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS ON THE FERRY. THANKS FOR MAKING ME TAKE IT. IT WAS NOTHING. SO I'M SURPRISED SOMEONE SO WELL-DRESSED WOULD TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. OH, IT'S GOOD EXERCISE AND CHEAPER. SHITTY ETIQUETTE INSTRUCTORS DON'T MAKE ENOUGH? THERE'S AN OPEN-MIKE THIS WEEKEND FOR STAND-UP COMEDIANS. I'M GOING TO SIGN YOU UP. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? GUESS. WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS I SEE AT THE GYM... RELIGIOUS ABOUT BEATING THEIR TIME EVERY DAY ON THE TREADMILL EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THEM PLATEAUED MONTHS AGO AND WON'T ADMIT IT TO THEMSELVES. I HATE RUNNING. THEN HOW DO YOU KEEP FIT? RIDE THE BIKE. DO YOU RIDE? ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RIDE A BIKE. - OH, HOW COME? - I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO. SO YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR. WHY? I DON'T LOOK LIKE I COULD SAVE SOME LIVES? WELL, YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT A MODEL. HEH. OUCH. - THAT HURTS. - OKAY, OKAY. SOMETHING FINANCE RELATED. NOT TOO FAR OFF BUT THIS IS HONG KONG AFTER ALL. LAWYER. - SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - OH, YOU POOR THING. WHAT? WOULDN'T BEING A LAWYER AT LEAST SEMI-IMPRESS YOU? IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF LAWYER YOU ARE. WELL, IT WAS A PLEASURE. YOU TOO. I'LL SEE YOU. YEAH. SEE YOU. RIGHT. SOPHIE, CAN YOU HOOK ME UP WITH TWO MORE OF THOSE MIND-BLOWING SHOTS THAT I LOVE SO MUCH? I'M EXPECTING FRIENDS. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL, THERE HE IS. LIAM! - HEY. - OH, MY GOD! YOU MISSED THE "GONG SHOW." JOHN JUST GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY A CHICK. WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED? YEAH, SOMEHOW HE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH HER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HER TITTIES WERE REAL. AND? WELL, SO HE GRABS THEM AND THEN BOOM. WHERE IS HE NOW? HE'S IN THE CAN TRYING TO STOP A NOSEBLEED. OH, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS CHICK? EVERY MINUTE INCESSANTLY TEXTING ME. CHECK IT OUT. - JESUS. - NOT BAD, HUH? YEAH, NOT BAD AT ALL. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GIRL JADE THAT YOU'RE WITH LAST NIGHT? SHE HAD PLANS. THAT'S TOO BAD. WHOA! - MY GOODNESS. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING. OH, YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP. YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, PADRE? I'M FINE. I'M FINE. EW. DO YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT? I THINK YOU'RE OKAY. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT REPORTER YOU'RE TALKING TO? HEY, I TOLD YOU. WE COME HERE TO FORGET ABOUT WORK. NOT RELIVE IT. HOLD ON. WE GOT TO DOCUMENT THIS. EXCUSE ME, MISS? HELLO, YOU ARE A LOOKER. DO YOU MIND TAKING A PICTURE OF MY FRIENDS AND I? YEAH, SURE. MY NAME IS CHAD BY THE WAY. - TERESA. - TERESA. YOU ARE JUST LOVELY. NICE, BRO. JUST PRESS THIS BUTTON? THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, SWEETHEART. OKAY. SAY CHEESE. BLOODY FUCKING NOSE. FUCK YOU. SHE WENT TO A LOCAL SCHOOL HERE IN HONG KONG AND THEN ATTENDED A UNIVERSITY IN KL, JOINED THE PEACE CORPS AFTERWARDS AND THEN DECIDED JOURNALISM WAS HER CALLING. HMM. THE GIRL MUST BE LOADED. WHO COULD MAKE A LIVING OFF OF BEING A JOURNALIST NOWADAYS? SHE SEEMS TO SCRAPE BY ON HER EARNINGS. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT, JOHN? SHE'S GOT THIS LITTLE BOY SHE'S FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OVER. - AND? - AND I KNOW THE JUDGE. SO WE COULD PUT IN A CALL. WHAT ABOUT THE GRANDSON EARL? I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO KNEW HIM. IT TURNS OUT HE'S A COMPLETE DOUCHEBAG, BUT KILLER? I'M NOT SO SURE. HOW ABOUT THE DNA TESTING? LAST I HEARD IT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN SEVERAL WEEKS. DOESN'T A TEST TAKE ONLY A FEW HOURS? ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERT YES, BUT THEY HAD TO RUN INDEPENDENT PROFILES ON EACH SET. IN ORDER TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO REPLICATE THE ENTIRE DNA SAMPLE. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS FOR THEM TO DO THAT. OKAY, YEAH. WE GET THE PICTURE. IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE, BUT IT'S GOOD FOR OUR CASE. OH, AND THE TEST? IT'S AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF A VERY LONG QUEUE. MAYBE THAT'S BETTER. IT'LL DEFINITELY BE DONE BEFORE THE IPO. A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DONE BEFORE THE IPO. MORE TO LEASE? THE BOSS SAYS THAT OUR VALUE OF SHARES IS HIGHER NOW. HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE TALKING? I'M THINKING NINE, MAYBE 12 MONTHS LONGER. SO DO WE GET THE ACCOUNT FROM THEM THEN? NO. OLI'S STILL CHASING. FUCK. GUYS, IF I COULD ADD ONE OTHER SCENARIO. PLEASE. THE WAY I SEE IT, THERE'S TWO OPTIONS. ONE, WE GET HER TIED UP IN THIS CHILD CUSTODY BATTLE. OR TWO, WE CUT HER LOOSE AND HOPE THAT SHE DOESN'T PUBLISH THE STORY. YEAH, THIS BITCH WRITES A STORY AND WE'RE ALL FUCKED. YEAH, I SAY WE CALL THE JUDGE AND DISTRACT THE SHIT OUT OF HER. - WE CAN'T DO THAT. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE. - HOW MANY OF THESE CASES HAVE WE HANDLED BEFORE? I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT IN MESSING WITH THE KID'S CHANCE OF HAVING A MOTHER. BOO FUCKING HOO. I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT HER, ALL RIGHT? I KNOW WHO I CARE ABOUT. IT'S YOU AND IT'S JOHN. WE'RE A TEAM. WE'RE GOING TO END UP ON UNEMPLOYMENT BODY BAGS IF WE CUT THIS BITCH SOME SLACK. YOU KNOW, OLIVER MADE IT VERY CLEAR HOW IMPORTANT THIS CASE IS. WITHOUT THE DNA CONFIRMED SHE'S GOT NOTHING? TRUE. NO HARD EVIDENCE, NO STORY. BUT WE COULD WAIT UNTIL THE DNA EVIDENCE IS CONFIRMED. YOUR CASE, YOUR CALL. I'D LIKE TO WAIT. I MEAN, WHAT? IT'S BEEN ABOUT A MONTH. MAYBE SHE'S MOVED ON. FINE. BUT FOR THE RECORD, LET ME TELL YOU THIS. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT. I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. THIS SCENARIO IS NOT GOING TO END WELL. YOU LOOK GOOD, LIAM. YOU TOO. SO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING? I SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY THIS. I'M PREGNANT. WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT? A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME NOW? I HAD TO CHECK IN WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE IT WAS YOU. YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT I'M 12 WEEKS. I WAS THE MOST RECKLESS WITH YOU. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL. BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE THIS WORK BETWEEN US. THIS ISN'T AN OPEN DISCUSSION. SORRY? I'M TAKING CARE OF IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DO I HAVE TO SPELL THIS OUT TO YOU? AN ABORTION. - ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? - YES, I'M SURE. GOD... WAIT, YOU DIDN'T... NO. YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT I WAS GOING TO USE THIS... GOD! I AM NOT THAT GIRL. YOU AND I HAD FUN, BUT I'M SO NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN. AND NO OFFENSE, BUT I CAN DO BETTER. THANKS FOR BEING HONEST. DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. BUT MY GIRLFRIEND JULIE FOUND A GUY WHO TAKES HER TO PARIS JUST TO SHOP AT CHAMPS-LESI. IT'S CHAMPS-ELYSEES. - WHAT? - NEVER MIND. LOOK, YOU'RE JUST NOT IN THAT LEAGUE. AND I KNOW I HAD THE LOOKS TO FIND SOMEONE OF THAT CALIBER. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? JUST 50,000 HONGKIES TO GET IT DONE. - I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. - AN ABORTION COST THAT MUCH? WELL, I'M GOING TO TREAT MYSELF TO A NEW HANDBAG THAT I'VE BEEN EYEING AFTERWARDS. IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER WHILE I RECOVER. ANYTHING YOU NEED. COME ON, PIA. - LIAM! - HI, EMILY. HEY, LIAM, SO GOOD OF YOU TO COME. COME, PIA. - THIS IS FOR YOU. - HEY, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. THANK YOU. LET ME JUST PUT THIS HERE. THERE'S SOMEONE I'VE BEEN MEANING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO. OKAY. HEY, SORRY I'M LATE. HEY, NO PROBLEM. LIAM, THIS IS ANGELA. - HI. - NICE TO MEET YOU. ANGELA HAS HER OWN JEWELRY STORE. AND THIS IS YAN AND HER BOYFRIEND MITCHELL. MOM. MOM, YOU GOT TO CHECK THIS OUT. EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE. - EMILY. - COME ON! I'M LIAM. NICE TO MEET YOU. WE'VE MET BEFORE, HAVEN'T WE? YES, A FEW CASES I'M AFRAID. OF COURSE, A NEW YORKER. RUTGER-BARNET AND ASSOCIATES, RIGHT? REMIND ME, WHICH LAW SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? IT WASN'T YALE, PENN OR ONE OF TOP ONES, WAS IT? SOME MIGHT SAY THE HARVARD OF THE PROLETARIAT. - THE WHAT? - RUTGERS LAW IN NEWARK. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT. WHAT'S A PROLETARIAT? IT MEANS WAGE OWNER OR LABORER. OH. I THINK I WAS INTERRUPTING A CONVERSATION. I'M JUST GOING TO... OH, NO, NO, NO. PLEASE, PLEASE. WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT IF THE MAINLAND HAD MARCHED INTO HONG KONG INSTEAD OF MAKING A DEAL WITH THE BRITISH FOR THE HANDOVER, I MEAN WHAT'S TO SAY, IT WASN'T IN OUR RIGHT? I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT CHINA DID A DEAL WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. NOT ONLY WOULD THERE BE MASSIVE UPROAR HERE IN HONG KONG BUT EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD WHICH HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH CHINA, WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I HATE POLITICS. BETTER I DON'T... NO, ACTUALLY, I'D QUITE LIKE TO HEAR YOUR OPINION, THAT'S IF YOU GOT ONE OF COURSE. WELL, I THINK SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, I THINK YOU'RE BEING, WHAT'S THE WORD, SLIGHTLY PRESUMPTUOUS. NOT TO MENTION YOU ARE REGURGITATING MARGARET THATCHER'S ARTICLE OFF WIKIPEDIA. I'M SORRY? GO ON. WELL, TAKE JAPAN. THEY COULD'VE MARCHED IN HONG KONG IN A DAY, BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IF CHINA GETS HONG KONG NOW OR 100 YEARS FROM NOW? SEE, HE SETTLED BECAUSE IT'D BE LESS TIME AND MONEY. AND EVENTUALLY CHINA WOULD GET WHAT IT WANTED. THAT'S NOT THE REAL ISSUE HERE, IS IT? - IT'S NOT? - NO, OF COURSE NOT. THIS IS A QUESTION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. SEE, WHO ARE WE AMERICANS OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY TO CHALLENGE A COUNTRY TAKING BACK WHAT'S ORIGINALLY THEIRS? I MEAN THAT'S JUST LIKE CHALLENGING ABRAHAM LINCOLN OVER THE CIVIL WAR. I'M GOING TO GET SOME WARMER AIR. YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A REAL FLARE FOR ENDING CONVERSATIONS. SORRY ABOUT THAT. DON'T BE. MITCH CAN BE QUITE PRETENTIOUS. SOMETIMES TO DIVORCE YOUR REAL OPINIONS FROM WORK LIFE LONG ENOUGH, THEY COME RUSHING AT YOU LIKE A DROP OF A HAT. WHY HAVE A JOB THAT REQUIRES YOU TO DO THAT? I COULDN'T THINK OF A PROFESSION THAT PAID WELL ENOUGH, SO I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. TELL ME SOMETHING, I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T DATE LAWYERS. I NEVER SAID THAT. BESIDES, YOU NEVER ASKED. YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE. WHY DIDN'T YOU? I WAS PLANNING TO... BUT YOU GOT IN THE CAB TOO FAST. TOO LATE. YOU DID SEND ME AWAY. ANYWAYS, YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND. MITCH? OH, NO, HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND. HE'S NOT? WE'VE BEEN ON A FEW DATES. WHY DIDN'T YOU CORRECT OLIVIA? I THINK THIS IS WHERE I SAY I PLEAD THE FIFTH. ARE YOU HUNGRY? HMM. I'M FAMISHED. I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVE SUCH AN ADMIRATION FOR A CONFIRMED COMMUNIST. WELL, IT'S NOT IDEOLOGY I ADMIRE, IT'S HIS ABILITY TO MANEUVER THROUGH IT AT SUCH TOUGH TIMES. MY DAD USED TO SAY THIS OLD CHINESE PROVERB. "NOTHING IS SOFTER OR MORE FLEXIBLE THAN WATER, YET NOTHING CAN RESIST IT." I KNOW WHO ALSO WHO SAID THAT. - WHO? - BRUCE LEE. BE LIKE WATER, MY FRIEND. RIGHT. OH, YEAH. AREN'T THOSE GARLIC SHRIMP TO DIE FOR? MAKE SURE TO DRINK MORE BEER SO YOU DON'T GET THE RUNS LATER ON. I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, I DID FEEL A RUMBLE IN MY TUMMY. EWW! GOOD THING WE DIDN'T ORDER THE RAW OYSTERS. OH, THAT WAS SO GOOD. I'M SO GLAD WE LEFT THE PARTY. TOTALLY. AND I'M FULL. I AM REALLY FULL. THANKS FOR WALKING ME HOME. I WAS GOING TO SAY ACTUALLY, CAN I USE YOUR TOILET? 'CAUSE MY STOMACH DOES NOT FEEL SO... NICE TRY. DIDN'T YOU JUST GO? I'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE. IT'LL BE REALLY QUICK. OH, I THOUGHT YOU LAST LONGER. OH, NICE. THANKS FOR TONIGHT. I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU TONIGHT. THEN I HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE THEN. A VERY SMALL ONE. GOOD NIGHT. COME ON, ONE MORE TIME. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. - OH. - YEAH, YEAH. OKAY, KEEP GOING. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO LET GO. NO, NO, NO, NO, DON'T. DON'T, NO, NO, NO. - YEAH. - WHAT DO I DO? GOOD. GOOD. NO? SHE LAUGHED AT ME. - I THINK SHE DID. - LOOK AT HER GO. SHE'S GOING TO SHOW UP. NO, DON'T COME OVER HERE. SHE'S GOING TO SHOW. OH, HERE SHE COMES. OH, WOW. GREAT JOB. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE LAUGHED AT ME. THAT COULD BE YOU. THAT COULD BE YOU. YOU'RE A DICK, YOU KNOW THAT? IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY QUIET UP HERE. A LITTLE SILENCE IS GOOD EVERY NOW AND THEN. - YOU LIKE IT? - GROWING UP, IT IS COMFORTING. MAKES ME FEEL RESTLESS. I SPENT MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD WANDERING THE HALLWAYS OF MY DAD'S HOTEL. I REMEMBER PRESSING MY EARS UP AGAINST THE DOORS, LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS. IF THEY WERE COMPLETELY SILENT, IT'D BE AS IF I WAS IN THE ROOM. THEN DAD WOULD QUICKLY PULL ME AWAY AND SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'LL SCARE THE CUSTOMERS." QUITE THE BUSINESSMAN. AH. HE KNEW HOW TO RUN THINGS, THAT'S FOR SURE. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY DRIVEN. HE'S KINDA LIKE YOU. ME? YEAH. YOU'D BE GOOD AT RUNNING A BUSINESS. NO WAY. THE ONLY THING MY DAD WAS GOOD AT WAS RUNNING THINGS INTO THE GROUND. WELL, I MET A LOT OF BUSINESSMEN THROUGH MY DAD AND THE ONES WHO FAILED ARE THE ONES WHO GAVE UP TOO EASILY. YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE THE TYPE. I'D NEVER STOP CHASING YOU. EVEN IF I KEPT GOING ON ABOUT THINGS? I'D TAKE YOU OUT EVERY NIGHT JUST TO HEAR YOU BABBLE ABOUT THE VIRTUE OF SILENCE. THAT'S KIND OF IRONIC, ISN'T IT? CAN'T YOU DRINK FROM A GLASS? SORRY. HEY, PERFECT TIMING. - OKAY. - I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. OH, I'M ALLERGIC TO ROSES. OH. ARE YOU READY YET? JUST A COUPLE MORE MINUTES. OH, YOU GOT ME A PRESENT. HOW SWEET. OH, YOU CAN BE SO SILLY SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW THAT? I TOLD YOU SHE DOESN'T LIKE PRESENTS. I CAN'T GO EMPTY-HANDED. WELL, WHAT IS IT? YOU'LL SEE. AH. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU LOOK LIKE A NIGHT BOX. YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT, ARE YOU? SHE'S GOING TO LOVE YOU. I HOPE SO. CAN I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE MINUTES? YEAH, SURE. JUST A SECOND. - HEY. - HEY, SIS. YAN, THIS IS MY SISTER ELAINE. IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU. COME IN. THIS IS FOR YOU. THANK YOU. I HOPE HOT POT'S OKAY. YEAH. I LOVE NEED SOME HELP? THAT WOULD BE LOVELY. LIAM, CAN YOU SET UP THE BURNER FOR ME? YEAH, SURE. WHERE IS IT? IT'S IN THE PLASTIC BAG BY THE SOFA. THIS IS YOUR DAD? YEAH. REALLY? THAT'S YOUR CHINESE NAME? HMM? YEAH. WILLIAM "LIAM." MOM STARTED CALLING ME THAT AFTER PEOPLE STARTED GETTING CONFUSED. IT JUST KINDA STUCK. - DID YOU FIND THE BURNER? - I'M JUST GOING TO QUICKLY GET SOME MORE GAS 'CAUSE THEY WERE OUT. HOW ARE YOU AT CHOPPING VEGETABLES? I CAN TRY. IT'S GREAT HOW LIAM HAS FAMILY HERE. YEAH, WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE EACH OTHER. DO YOU HAVE ANY SIBLINGS? I'M AN ONLY CHILD. OH, IT MUST BE HARD NOT HAVING A BROTHER OR SISTER TO DEPEND ON. DO YOU SEE ANY OF YOUR FAMILY AT ALL? MOSTLY MY DAD. HE'S NOT REALLY CLOSE TO ANY OF HIS SIBLINGS AT ALL. SO IT'S MOSTLY JUST US. OH, AN INTROVERT. OH, NO. HE'S GOT LOTS OF FRIENDS. GIRLFRIENDS, I SHOULD SAY. AND HE'S MARRIED TO HIS BUSINESS. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS? HOTELS. HOW DID HE GET INTO THAT? AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, HE WENT BACK TO SHANGHAI AND STARTED ONE. I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT ANY BETTER IN THE KITCHEN FOR HAVING A HOTEL. ARE YOU DONE WITH THAT? OH, I'M SORRY. IT'S FINE. HERE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS TO THE OTHER ROOM? SURE. IN COLLEGE I CHOOSE BETWEEN LEARNING WINE OR COOKING. I CHOSE WINES, AS YOU CAN SEE. - WHAT COLLEGE? - CORNELL. THAT'S A GOOD SCHOOL. LIAM REALLY WANTED TO GO THERE. IMAGINE IF HE HAD GONE YOU MIGHT HAVE MET HIM THERE. YEAH, HE'S QUITE A SMART GUY. WHY DIDN'T HE? DID LIAM EVER TELL YOU THE STORY HOW HE CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL AND SURPRISED US FOR DAD'S 60TH BIRTHDAY? NO. HE NEVER TOLD ME THAT STORY. HE HAD WORKED THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT IN THE LIBRARY ALL SEMESTER LONG TO AFFORD AIRFARE. WHEN HE GOT HERE, HE JUST CAME IN AND WENT TO DAD'S DESK AND PUT A LETTER ON IT. IT WAS FROM STANFORD. HE WAS ONE OF 11 TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT YEAR. OF COURSE, HE COULDN'T GO BECAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD THE TUITION. BUT HE WANTED DAD TO KNOW THAT HE COULD GO ANYWHERE HE WANTED. IT MUST BE REASSURING TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A FAMILY BUSINESS TO TAKE OVER, WHEN YOUR DAD'S READY. NOT REALLY. ARE YOU KIDDING? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I HAVE SOME SAY ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF MY OWN LIFE. ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? THEY'RE ALL OUT OF GAS REFILLS. ISN'T THIS INDUCTION PLATE GREAT? HEATS THINGS UP REAL FAST. I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE OUR FOOD RADIOACTIVE. IT'S NOT RADIOACTIVE. IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE THAT KILLS YOU. WELL, WHAT DID YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT WHILE I WAS GONE? NOTHING REALLY. WE WERE BUSY PREPARING THE FOOD. HERE'S TO MY TWO FAVORITE WOMEN GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. YEAH, SHE CAN BE REALLY STUCK IN HER WAYS, BUT... SHE MEANS WELL. SHE CERTAINLY KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK HER MIND. WELL, EVER SINCE SHE STARTED ON THOSE MEDS SHE JUST SAYS WHATEVER. SHE CAN REALLY PISS ME OFF SOMETIMES TOO, BUT I JUST HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF SHE'S MY SISTER. SOMETIMES I WONDER WHAT I'D BE LIKE IF I HAD A BROTHER. HAVING A BROTHER OR SISTER DOES HAVE ITS ADVANTAGES BUT BEING AN ONLY CHILD CAN BE PRETTY COOL TOO. HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. WHAT'S GOING ON? I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT MY FATHER. HE SOUNDS LIKE A DECENT GUY. RUNS A HOTEL, RIGHT? WELL, NOT JUST A HOTEL, A BUNCH OF HOTELS. A BUNCH LIKE WHAT? TWO OR THREE? MORE THAN THAT. A LOT MORE. YOU'RE NOT SOME PARIS HILTON OF CHINA, ARE YOU? HOLY SHIT. WHEN I LEFT, HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE EXPECT ME TO BE HOME WITHIN A YEAR TO HELP HIM RUN THE BUSINESS. THAT'S REALLY SOON. I KNOW. AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD TELL HIM I WAS STAYING IF I WANTED TO. IT'S JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOUR SISTER SAID. WHAT'D SHE SAY? WELL, JUST HOW DEDICATED YOU ARE TO YOUR FATHER... OH, COME ON! THAT'S NOT THE SAME. WHY NOT? YAN, MY FATHER WENT BANKRUPT THEN WORKED ALL OF HIS LIFE TO GET US BACK TO EVEN. HE DIED EVEN BEFORE HE GOT THE CHANCE. NO OFFENSE, BUT YOUR FATHER'S DOING JUST FINE. I'M HIS ONLY CHILD. SO? WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT? WHEN MY MOM FOUND OUT SHE WAS HAVING A GIRL, SHE WANTED AN ABORTION. AND HE STOPPED HER. BACK THEN, WE COULDN'T AFFORD TWO CHILDREN. IT COST AN ARM AND A LEG AT LEAST TO RAISE AN EXTRA CHILD. AND HE'S A GOOD MAN FOR THAT, OKAY. BUT THAT'S HIS CHOICE, NOT YOURS. AFTER I WAS BORN, SEEING ME JUST SICKENED HER. BUT HIS LOVE NEVER CHANGED. DON'T I OWE HIM SOMETHING FOR THAT? NOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. YAN... I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT YOU CANNOT BE HELD HOSTAGE BY SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. I'M SORRY. HEY, I LOVE YOU. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU. MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN MEET? YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT. AAH! WHAT? DO YOU PICK UP YOUR PHONE? I'M SORRY. I WAS ASLEEP. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER, ELAINE? TO WHO? TO YAN. YOU MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING, 'CAUSE NOW SHE'S FREAKING OUT ABOUT HER DAD. WHAT... NOTHING REALLY. ARE YOU SURE IT WAS NOTHING? I... SAID WHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IT IS TO HAVE A FAMILY BUSINESS THAT'S DOING WELL. THAT'S IT? YEAH. I TALKED ABOUT YOU AND DAD A LOT. - LIKE WHAT? - LIKE GOOD STUFF. LIKE HOW DEVOTED YOU ARE TO HIM. GIVE ME A BREAK, ELAINE. WITH WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD! - JEEZ! GOD KNOWS I COULD'VE. - WHAT? OH, COME ON! IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE NOT THE MOST TRADITIONAL OF LAWYERS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MOST LAWYERS, THEY SIT AT A DESK ALL DAY. THEY PUSH PAPERS AROUND. YOU, YOUR OFFICE, AT MEETINGS, GOD KNOWS WHERE ON THE PHONE TALKING CRYPTIC, SHADY STUFF. COME ON. I KNOW HOW TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. HEY, WE DO WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO GET THE CLIENTS, OKAY. THAT'S JUST... THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS! WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET A NEW JOB. YOU KNOW, I FIND IT SLIGHTLY IRONIC THAT YOU'RE SHITTING ON THE SAME JOB THAT'S PUTTING A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD! OH, I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS! DAMN IT! WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO, HUH? YOU'RE MY SISTER. I'D RATHER BE DESTITUTE THAN SEE YOU BECOME SOME SORT OF DEGENERATE. YOU FUCKING BITCH! HOW DARE YOU! NO! YOU WHAT? YOU PAY A COUPLE OF MONTHS RENT AND YOU FILL MY PILLS EVERY SO OFTEN AND YOU THINK I SHOULD BE ALL GRATEFUL? I TOOK CARE OF YOU WHEN DAD WASN'T THERE! I WATCHED DAD WHEN YOU WERE UP AT SCHOOL! NO! I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING! DON'T YOU FUCKING HATE ME! I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT! - GET THE FUCK OUT! - FINE! GO! DARLING, THE ACIDITY IS TOO MUCH FOR DADDY. - OH. - NO, NO, NO. DAD, THIS IS LIAM. - HI. - LIAM. HELLO, LIAM. NICE TO MEET YOU. - IT'S A PLEASURE. - HELLO. BAIJIU. GET SOME BAIJIU. DAD, THEY ONLY SERVE WINE HERE. NONSENSE. THEY SERVE BAIJIU EVERYWHERE. THIS IS FOR YOU. CHOCOLATES. I DON'T EAT SWEETS BUT THANK YOU ALL THE SAME. HOW VERY KIND OF YOU. YAN DIDN'T TELL ME. ACTUALLY, I'M ON A DIET. OH, ACTUALLY, I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS THIS GIRL NEXT TIME SHE VISITED. BUT YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET HER TO COME HOME, HUH? HUH? COME ON. SIT DOWN. COME ON. IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO SEE MY LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH GUESTS. AH, HERE WE ARE. LIAM, IS IT? - YES, THAT'S RIGHT. - HERE WE GO. LET'S DRINK TO OUR... HAPPINESS. TO OUR HAPPINESS. CHEERS. CHEERS. GOOD? IT'S GOOD. OH, SPLENDID. WE ORDERED SOME COURSES AHEAD OF TIME, IF YOU DON'T MIND, 'CAUSE I WAS REALLY HUNGRY. RIGHT. WE'VE GROWN THIS CHAIN FROM HERE TO MORE THAN 20 LOCATIONS. WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING A HEADQUARTERS IN THE CITY IN A FEW YEARS TIME... IF THEY LET ME. DAD. WHAT? YOU NEED SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER THE RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT? I'M SURE IN TIME IT'LL WORK OUT.

REALLY I AM, BECAUSE I KINDA LIKED HER. SHE'S ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THINGS. YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE SITUATIONS THAT WE'VE HANDLED OVER THE LAST FIVE, SIX YEARS? IT'S HELL OF A LOT OF BULLSHIT. NOW YOUR HANDS ARE COMPLETELY WASHED OF IT. HELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU JOINED THE FIRM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 'CAUSE OF ITS PRESTIGIOUS NAME. WHEN I FIRST MET YOU... I THOUGHT THAT FOR SURE YOU WOULD QUIT, MOVE ON AS SOON AS YOU FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CHIMNEY SWEEPERS TO RICH PEOPLE. YEAH. NOW I GOT TO FIND A WHOLE NEW SET OF CHIMNEYS, HUH? YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? COMPLETELY SERIOUS. WHY DON'T YOU OPEN YOUR OWN BUSINESS OR SOMETHING? AT LEAST DO SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT. WHY? I WOULD'VE PERFECTLY BEEN HAPPY BEING YOUR WINGMAN. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU! DO NOT SAY THAT. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ME. I KNOW A MILLION GUYS WHO WOULD KILL TO LIVE THE LIFESTYLE YOU DO. HEY, I AM NOT GUILTY ABOUT THAT, OKAY. I FEEL NOT AN IOTA OF GUILT ABOUT THAT 'CAUSE I WORKED MY ASS OFF ALL MY LIFE. I WAS A VALEDICTORIAN, YOU KNOW, AND THE PROM KING IN HIGH SCHOOL. WENT TO HARVARD LAW THINKING THAT I COULD CHANGE THE WORLD. I HAD TEN OFFERS COMING OUT OF SCHOOL, ONE OF WHICH WAS FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF NEW YORK CITY, PROSECUTING CRIMINALS. WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE IT? 'CAUSE I WAS TOO MUCH OF A FUCKING CHICKENSHIT TO TAKE THE PAY CUT. MY PARENTS... THEY WERE BACK HOME RUNNING A DELI TRYING TO SAVE MONEY... FOR ME. IT KILLS ME SOMETIMES 'CAUSE... MAYBE I'LL BE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY AND BE A LITTLE BIT RICHER IN 30 YEARS... OR SOMEHOW. SOMEHOW I'M GOING TO ALWAYS WONDER WHAT MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE IF I'D TAKEN THAT JOB, MADE MY PARENTS PROUD. MAYBE DONE SOMETHING FUCKING GOOD. LISTEN... HAVING YOU AS MY WINGMAN AND ALL WAS GREAT. BUT HONESTLY, HONESTLY, YOU HAVE WAY MORE POTENTIAL THAN YOU'VE EVER GIVEN YOURSELF CREDIT FOR. IF YOU JUST PROMISE ME, PROMISE ME THAT YOU JUST GROW A BALL SACK AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT, SOMETHING, I DON'T CARE WHAT AFTER THIS. JUST FUCKING GO OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING, OKAY? YEAH, WE JUST... WE JUST LOST OUT I GUESS. HONG KONG. THE PLACE WAS SOMETHING, HUH? - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, BABE. - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. - HI. - HI. COME IN. THANKS FOR HAVING ME OVER ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. SURE. THIS IS MY GODFATHER ALBERT. PA, THIS IS LIAM. HEY. THIS IS LIAM. SORRY, HE LOST MOST HIS HEARING FROM HIS THROAT CANCER. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK? WATER WOULD BE GOOD. HOW ABOUT TEA? SURE. HERE YOU GO. MY GODFATHER USED TO BE A GENIUS WRITER. THANK YOU. LIAM, I'M COMPLETELY PREPARED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS. - I KNOW THAT YOU GOT... - MAGGIE, I DIDN'T COME HERE... FIRED AND THEN YOU'RE NO LONGER THERE. OKAY, I'M SORRY. I THINK THIS IS BETTER. THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE. I REPLAYED A LOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN MY HEAD AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. ESPECIALLY NOW, IT'S A LOT CLEARER TO ME TO SEE. I'VE NEVER BEEN COMFORTABLE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE HAD TO DO FOR MY CLIENTS. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY. OH. IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE QUESTION, THOUGH. SURE. YOU COULD'VE BEEN CRUCIFIED BY THE FIRM. WHY'D YOU RISK IT? WHEN I WAS WRITING THE STORY, OF COURSE I WAS TERRIFIED. BUT THEN ONE DAY I WAS WATCHING TV AND I JUST COULD NOT PAY ATTENTION. I REALIZED I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING SINCE I PUT DOWN THE STORY. AND THEN I GOT ANGRY AT MYSELF 'CAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO AFTER SOMETHING THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN. LIAM? THANKS FOR THE TEA, MAGGIE. HI, LIAM. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO DROP BY, BUT COME IN. BABY. I SHOULD COME BACK. NO. I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. HE'S ABOUT FOUR HOURS OLD. WHAT'S HIS NAME? WE NAMED HIM AFTER HIS FATHER. - HI. - HI. YOU MUST BE LIAM. YEAH. HI. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M MALCOLM. PLEASE, COME ON IN. HONEY, WHO WAS IT? OH, YOU GUYS MET? YES, OF COURSE. YOU GUYS, I WAS JUST HEADING OUT TO DO SOME ERRANDS SO WHY DON'T I JUST LEAVE YOU BE. ELAINE, HONEY, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GET YOU? NO, THANK YOU. LIAM, IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. GOOD TO MEET YOU. THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT. I THREW SOME STUFF OUT. HOW'S YAN? OH. HOW ARE YOU? DO YOU WANT TO GET SOME AIR? I GOT MY TEST RESULTS BACK. AND? THEY'RE GOOD. THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
