I'm Victoria, Goddess of the Underworld. You caught me in my feeding hour, lucky you, or I should say unlucky you. Well let's get to it. I don't have all day. It was 1962, Halloween night, the Walenskis were passing out candy to the local children. I had a trick and Dr. Walenski was my treat. Trick or treat. Well happy Halloween. Well here's a treat for you. There you go, okay off you go. You be safe now, brush your teeth, doctor's orders. You have a wonderful night, bye now. Hello doctor. Raymond, Raymond! Sweetheart, isn't it too much food? Nonsense, it's our little Susie's sweet 16 and I want to make a breakfast that's fit for a queen. I remember when you were 15. Oh, do you now? Oh, Raymond, what if she comes in here? Oh. Good morning. - Hello dear. - Oh wow gee. Yes, sweetheart I've prepared all of your favorite breakfast dishes, see. Oh mom, you didn't have to do that. We want to ensure this is the best sweet 16 birthday ever. Sure thing daddy-o. So daddy, I was thinking you could pick me up from school at 3:00 to go to the DMV. Oh honey, I completely forgot. You forgot? We've been planning this for six months. Something's come up. I'm so sorry dear. How could something just come up? We've been planning this. Darling your father and I have something to tell you, but we don't want you to worry. Last week, when I told you that your father fell and hit his head and we had to block all of the light out of the windows, well that wasn't entirely true. What do you mean? Your father has a condition. A condition? Yes. Hypermesisangrichavidarum. Oh no, oh daddy. I'm fine dear. Your mother and I don't want you to worry. It's... Ah, hello there's the birthday girl. Daddy, are you all right? I'm fine dear. Oh whoops, sorry about that. Turn the fan on, it's... Hey, what's wrong? Uncle Bob, Daddy has hypermesisangrivadarum. I'm so worried. Raymond has an allergy to light Bob. Oh, yeah, that sounds awful. Yes it is awful. He can't even take me to the DMV. Oh sweetheart, I would take you, but I have a giant cake to bake for your birthday. It's okay I'll just get my license another time. Well hey I can take you. Really Uncle Bob? Yeah, anything for you Susie Q. Oh, well that's so kind Bob. Isn't it dear? Yes dear. Oh, oh that's Margaret. But but darling you haven't had any breakfast. Here have an egg and a pancake. - Thank you mom. - Oh. Happy birthday my darling. - Oh. - Bye daddy. Bye. Pick me up 2:45 okay? Our little angel just hustling off to be productive in this world, my little bunny just skipping along. Hypermesisangrigravitdarum. What was I supposed to say? How about I had an important client? And make your daughter feel like she comes second? Bob how many times do I have to tell you not to bring blood into this kitchen when Susie's here? Ah, sorry sis. I wish you wouldn't do that. Do what? Never mind. Oh, by the way you guys should have seen the guy from last night that I worked on. 300 pounds, shut in, real sweet face, you could tell he was a good guy. Thank to heaven but the insides smelled nice. Anyways, I got 15 liters out of him. You're welcome. We are so grateful for all your help. What would we do without you? Um, that's what family is for. Speaking of which, when are you going to tell Susie? - Never. - Never. Now who could that be? It's 7:30 in the morning. Natasha, Natasha. You doing all right there Raydog? Hey sis. Betty, I'm sure that you have absolutely nothing to worry about. No my Ginger only barks when she senses danger. - Oh is that so? - Yes. You know is the moon out recently? Yes, because I hear that animals are affected by lunar phases. No no, it's more than that. Hey sis, Raymond is acting real kook. Oh hello. Hi. Do you care to introduce us sis? Betty this is my brother Bob. Bob, this is Betty. - Oh Betty. - Bob. That's a name as well. Oh my this is Ginger. I have never seen a finer dog in my life. So you live near here? Okay, don't even answer that. That's all right. Did you have something to tell me? Uh uh. - Bob? - Yeah. It's just that Raymond is acting a little off. - Raymond? - A little different. A little different, what do you mean by different? He's not really the same as yesterday. Is everything okay? Yes Betty everything is fine. Everything is great. It's bad. How bad? Pretty bad. Is something going on? - No Bob why don't you go... - I could make you a drink. And Betty everything is fine, I'll let you know if there's any unusual activity in the neighborhood, all right? - All right. - Stop by anytime. - Yes, Goodbye Bob. - I'm usually here. - I'd like that. - Ciao. - Maybe tomorrow. - Yes, thank you, - bye bye. - Bye Betty. Bye. This is bad. Yeah, but at least he's cleaning up after himself. Ms. Jones is Dr. Walenski. Are you feeling better? Yes, that is why I'm calling. I need to reschedule our appointment for today. No no, nothing is wrong. I'm just a little under the weather and I wouldn't want you to catch my bug. Yes, I'm sure I'll be fine. I will do that, okay thank you. Hey Ray-dio, practice has really taken a dump eh? Been there. Well don't worry about it, everything's gonna bounce back. Why are you so chipper? Because my friend I believe in the power of positive thinking. There's nothing positive about this. I'm a monster Bob. Okay, A that's not true, you're not a monster. You're a great dad. You just love blood. And B, this is very positive. I mean look at me. Before this happened, I was alone with dead people and now I'm here with you guys, draining cadavers, learning psychiatry. We're best friends. This is very positive. What happens if I go completely crazy in front of Susie? That's not gonna happen, because I'm not gonna allow it. No we'll figure it out. You're a psychiatrist, let's psychiatrize this. I got it. I can hypnotize you. It takes a trained professional to properly hypnotize a subject Bob. Nah, I've seen movies. You are getting very sleepy. No I'm not. Your eyes find themselves closing. I'm wide awake. You find yourself in a trance-like state Raydog. Hmm. Did it work? You! Ah. Hiya, I'm Bob. I'm Victoria, Goddess of the Underworld. Ah jeepers, I thought hey there's a colleague. I work with the dead too, put it there. I wish there could have been another way, Dr. Walker but you came highly recommended. Oh, did you want to say something? It's Dr. Walenski, Raymond Walenski, not Walker. Oh dear, I made a mistake. You ruined my life. Walker, Walenski it's an easy mistake to make. Don't be mad. You turn people into monsters. I never harm anybody without a good reason. I'm not a beast Raymond. The underworld has such a bad reputation. It really hurts the way we are misunderstood. We have feelings Raymond. We? Us, changelings, vampires, zombies, witches, ghouls, heck even the smelly werewolves. You recruited me into your little club because you need a psychologist. Actually, I meant to bite Mr. Walker, but I guess you'll do. Ah, such a temper, my goodness. Well your patients will be arriving shortly and who knows? In time, you actually might find it quite rewarding. Welcome to the family Mr. Walker. He's a strange one. Bye bye. It's Walenski. I like her. I hate her. Wait no no, you are looking at this all wrong. Okay this, this an opportunity. I can't believe you're making this into a positive thing. Of course I am, listen think of all those creatures out there sad, lonely, in need of help. This is a way for you to put your practice back on its feet and do some real good at the same time. Only you would say that. You love dead people. I do. You really get me. We're not best friends. You're upset. Hello dear. Oh, hello handsome. You feeling more like yourself dear? I am. You have done a fantastic job. Susie will love it. Where is our birthday girl? Oh, she's getting ready. Oh by the way I bought her a birthday dress. It was just a little bit pricey, I hope you don't mind. It's worth it. - Oh look at that. - Darling. Oh. Oh dear, do you have any idea how long that flower arrangement took me to do? The rose looks better on you. Well I wouldn't even know would I? You hid all the mirrors in the garage didn't you? I feel so horrible lying to her. Yes, me too. If anybody sees a giant bug don't step on it. Wow, you guys look fantastic. Here get together. Okay say cheese. Oh yeah, this is gonna be a keeper. Now who's that? Gee, Susie like a movie star. I'm so happy you can make it tonight Jimmy. Oh Susie. Now that you know where I live, you can come over any time. Any time? Any time. Whoa whoa whoa, what about your parents? You can meet them, come, come! Mom, dad, Uncle Bob, this is Jimmy Dawson, my boyfriend. Glad to meet you sir, ma'am. Boyfriend. Jeepers, you're a handsome man Jimmy. Welcome to the family. Boyfriend. Jimmy and I have been going steady for a month. A month. That's right. A month. - Sweetheart. - James. Sweetheart, that's not the dress that I bought you. Don't I look like a movie star? - Yes, so tight. - Very mature. I hate him. Honey. Hey you guys scoot closer. Let's take a picture. Oh no, I don't think we should. Yeah. Oh. Say cheese. You could be sisters. Now my supper's burning. So Jimmy, tell me what do you do? Well sir, I'm a poet. Ah, I'm a mortician myself. Wow how do you end up morticianing? Well let's see after the navy, I ended up applying and then flunking out of medical school then nursing school, then a lot of other schools, eventually I couldn't even get in. And then luckily the school for the funeral arts was accepting everybody and one thing led to another and now pure bliss. Gee, what a gas huh? Yes, what a gas. So James, poetry you say it for a job? You can do it as a job? Oh, which reminds me sweetie. I got you something. Look at me shaking. Woo, my Susie Q, - with eyes so blue. - Her eyes are brown. Your heart so tender, skin so soft, forever true, my love will be for you, my sweet Susie Q. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. Help me. - You like it? - Yes. - Yeah. - Oh! Just look at them. Poetry is power. Oh dear. You like it? Oh they're really going for it? Darling, darling, it's all right, over here, over here, over here, yes, all right see yes. Oh, shall we eat? Do you need help dear? No, I'm fine honey. Uncle Bob, can I see the photos? Oh of course, what do you think of my handiwork? That's weird. Dad, you're not in any of the photos. That is very strange. You know what that probably is. I bought this film from a carnival worker and you cannot trust them. Have you ever seen such a thing? No. Maybe your dad's a vampire. That's so funny. The reason that she's laughing so boisterously is because there's no reason he could be a vampire. No, if that were true, all of us would be lying to you and keeping a huge secret. Well you know what they say, vampires can't be seen in photos because they have no soul. I didn't know that. - Yeah, I read that. - I read that too. Here you go, you go ahead and get started dear, I'll be right back. Yes dear. Dad are you all right? Yes, yes, just managed to pinch a nerve didn't I? Cover that up so nobody can see it. Hey hi, so how did you two lovebirds meet? In chemistry class. Chemistry, do you like chemistry? Oh yeah, it's neat. I flunked four times, but Susie's been really good helping me out. She's really helping me get the hang of it now. She's really smart. She is smart, like her mother. Oh thank you dear. Yes please, oh yeah. Here's to a family with no secrets. No. I think this is your dad's. Oh look at that, it's your special wine dear. It's divine, aged to perfection as they say. - Can I try some? - No, no you may not dear. You drink your water. Eat your loaf. Okay. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Susie ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday. Oh. Is that how welcome all your new patients? The kick? Who are you? I'm Oliver, I'm here to see Dr. Walenski. - Oh yes yes. - Oh Dr. Walenski. I was referred by Vicky. Wonderful, please have a seat over here. - Okay okay. - Please walk forward, lie down on the couch. Raymond! My love, my sweet darling. I assure I'll explain everything, but for now could you please give us some privacy? Let the doctor do his work. Privacy? Yes dear. Bats flying around in my house, Susie where are you? How are we gonna help this creature? Get out Bob. That sounds wise. Shall we begin? Is that a trick question? I feel like that's a trick question. I feel like you're trying to trick me. You're just like all the others and by the others I mean dad, and by dad I mean my father and by father I mean my papa. You want to know something? You want to know my father said to me. He goes, "Humans no matter where they're from, "they can all do one thing really well. "They can all die. "You know what you can't do son? "You can't die." How did that make you feel? Clearly, I'm not comfortable. I'm not comfortable with myself, which is really the problem. Yeah, you want to know what it is? Okay, great question, I'll tell you. I don't like myself and I definitely don't love myself, so there you go, so how do you fix that in one session? This isn't people stuck on an island. From the depths of evil comes the diabolic killer of beautiful women. That's not good. It's in the vampire's coffin. Oh Raydog. Is that Bob I smell? Oh. Oh, you're on all the channels, that's neat. Embrace the darkness or else there will be no light. No no, no no no no no no no. Hmm. Hey, you don't look too good buddy. What's going on? Where's Natasha? She took Susie to school. Okay open up what's going on? I ate Betty's dog. Ah, it is a good thing you are my best friend. I bet she'll need someone to comfort her. Okay, always a bright side. I feel very sick. Yeah, well vampires aren't supposed to eat animals. How am I supposed to know that Bob? It's common knowledge. Really go to the library. Susie is home. I thought you said she was at school. Oh my angel what are you doing home? Hi hey. What are you two doing, is that blood? Uncle Bob is conducting experiments for work with blood. Uh huh. - Oh, that's gross. - Disgusting. But is it? I'm thinking of these as dolls. I'm gonna call them blood buddies. This one is Margaret, she's a musician. This one, what did you name this one? Ed. I just forgot my book bag. Oh, there it is right there sweetheart. - Good cover buddy. - Have a good day Uncle Bob. You too kiddo. You two should kiss. Honey, I know things have been different the last two weeks. I know we haven't gotten much time to spend together. That's okay. How are you feeling? Oh wonderful, just peachy. - Dad? - Hmm? Is there a cure for hypermemisangrivadarum? Oh, hypermesisgravi, gravi, no. No, I'm afraid not. Are you gonna die? Oh no. Oh, oh I'm so glad. I was really worried. Were you now? Of course I love you dad. Oh, I love you too sweetheart. Oh, I'm gonna be late. Oh yes of course. Sorry about that it was a little dramatic. I'm sorry I forgot about the... Oh no, no no no off you go. - Are you okay? - Yes wonderful. Little hot under the collar so they say. Off you go, have a great day. Okay, watch out, sorry. Yes, yes, off you go. I'll be here, just call if you need me. Honey, ice pack. Oh God, Bob, don't you have to work or something? For goodness sake. You know the beauty with working with the dead is they never know if you're blowing off work. Listen, the ladies are coming over for bridge any minute. Hey, speaking of that, Betty is coming yes? Yes. Oh, that's them. Promise you won't embarrass me. Sis, it's me. Can you pick these up for me? Bob! I need grapes. We have some lovely cocktails prepared for you ladies this evening. - Thank you. - Lovely. So why the blackout curtains Natasha? Well haven't you heard? It's the latest thing to prevent premature aging. Yes I just hung them a few weeks ago and I already feel years younger. Well you do look wonderful Natasha. I'm so worried. My little Ginger didn't come home last night. I'll get the hors d'oeuvres. - Perhaps she's in heat. - Yes. Animals have a very strong urge to mate. No no no, I'm telling you that there's something not right. I'm certain I saw a man lurking around my house last night. Oh Betty, come on, now this is a perfectly safe neighborhood. What if there's a predator? I live alone. Who's going to protect me? Probably Mr. Peters, they tell you he tried to look up my skirt the other day? Horny old man! Ah, here we are! Oh goodness me, I forgot to take your coats, how silly! Thank you, thank you, there we are. There we are. Hello. Oh, hi. Jane, Mary, this is my brother Bob. He's visiting. - Hey Bob. - Hello. Hi. Hello again. Would you ladies care for a drink? I'd love that. - Yes, please. - Yes. Just hold on. He's a dreamboat, an absolute dreamboat. - Betty. - Betty. - Your cards. - Oh yes. Let's play the game. That's why we're here. - That's right. - Yes. Dreadful hand. - Bob. - Yeah? Is that your doing? Is what my doing? Betty's dead dog is in the closet. Oh, so that's where he put it. And you knew about this? Of course I knew. God, all right, just act normal. - I always do. - Go be normal. How are we doing here? Oh Raymond, may I have a word with you? Excuse me. Raymond, what is Betty's dead dog in the coat closet? I'm sorry honey. Raymond, how could you? It's so annoying how it barked all the time. I couldn't help myself. Raymond, you cannot go around biting people's dogs. What if people get suspicious? Yes, no more pets. And just so you know it made me really sick. Good, oh. Thank you dear. Well. Okay. For milady. It's beautiful, so festive and you three. It's lovely, mahalo. Mahalo. Natasha tells me that you're a mortician. Indeed I am, I perform the funeral arts. Oh, that's where I know you from. You dealt with my late husband Mort. I see so many dead bodies I don't know. Well you did, you were the only in town and you made him look 30 years younger. I guess I have a talent, but I'll tell you the secret, a little bit of coconut oil, - stop it. - Stop it. - Coconut oil and... - Stop it. And a luffa does wonders. Well I know I'm not dead yet, but could you do that for me? What, I want to look 30 years younger. It's a luffa, not a magic wand. Oh Natasha you must feel so safe living in this house with two strong men to protect you. Oh. Eh? Yes, yes. She does. You know my dog Ginger that you met? She's missing and I'm certain that a prowler took her. Ginger was a fantastic beast. It's probably just a coyote or a ravenous raccoon. You know what why don't we just play the game shall we? No trump in this round. I live alone you know. Oh, I didn't know that. - Yes. - No husbands or lovers? Not at the moment. Oh, well if you'd like I could come over and help check your locks and your windows. I'd like that. You would? You know you have very kind eyes and your fluffy beard it's just beautiful. You remind me of someone. Ginger? I was thinking more like a cross between Santa Claus and Frankie Avalon. I think it's your turn. She's got a seven, a four, two nines and a jack. - Oh! - God sake! - Ruin the game! - Betty. - You're up. - Cinnamon roll anyone? - Yes thank you. - No thank you. He makes a wonderful cocktail. He's a dreamboat, an absolute dreamboat. Yes, I've been told. Dad? Oh hi sweetie. - Hello. - How was your day? Oh it was really good. That's a really nice tie. Oh, oh yes. Yes it is, not my favorite, but... It looks really good on you. Oh, well maybe I'll wear it more often. Did you need help with your homework? No, I just wanted to talk with you. Oh, yes of course. What is it sweetie? So you talk to people and you help them with relationships and their feelings and how that all works together. And this is really embarrassing actually, it's about sex. Sex? Yes. I know a kid doesn't normally talk to a parent about this kind of thing, but since you are a doctor, I was thinking you could see me as a client and you could give me your advice. Hmm, does Jimmy want to have with you? That's just the thing. He thinks we should wait and I don't understand why. Perhaps it's because he could go to jail for a very long time, it's illegal. - Dad. - He's breaking the law. - Dad. - You are far too young to be thinking about these types of things with boys. I am not too young. You are 12 years old. I am 16 years old. I just had a birthday. Happy birthday to you. You don't understand. Has he married you, do you have a ring on your finger? - Well no. - Exactly. - No, but I... - You consummate - upon marriage. - I thought you of all people would understand this. I know that you think he's a nice young man. - He is. - But there are a lot of nice young men in the world and you don't give this thing to the first one you meet. Mom did. That was different. No it's not. How is it different? We were in love. We are in love. We love each other. She loves me and I love her. We are in love. You are not in love. You go to your room. You are so wrong. Go to your room, come back here, uh, we'll continue this later. Okay honey good talk. Love, capital L, love, oh. Oh, my love. Are you all right dear? - Not really. - Oh my. You seem flush darling. Here take this off, here let me help you with that. Thank you my dear. We'll just set it here for now all right. Wait a minute, Raymond, what did you do? Oh nothing. I don't believe you. I know that face. It's Susie. - You bit Susie? - No. I wouldn't do that. She is our daughter. She tried to talk to me about sex. Sex? I was completely unprepared. Oh, my poor little sweet innocent angel princess doll Susie. I'm going to kill that boyfriend. Susie, Susie come down here right now. Natasha, Natasha, that will only make things worse. Oh my poor little Susie going out with that poet. Wait here. Oh for heaven's sakes. Did you need something mom? Yes Susie, you and I we're going to have a nice little chat. He told you didn't he? I hate dad. Well now don't you talk about your father that way. I shared with dad private, personal things and instead of treating me like a client, he treated me like a child. Darling, your father and I both agree that Jimmy is too old for you. - He's only 18. - You're 16. I love him. I, I - Jimmy Jimmy? - Yes Jimmy. Oh you know what darling? You you you should be patient with your father because he's been through a very difficult last few weeks. I just feel like he's being difficult. Yes, yes, I agree, I agree. I know you don't like Jimmy. I'm sure that he was a very nice person. - Was? - Is. When you met daddy was it love at first sight? Um, yes actually yes. It was love at first sight darling. Oh so you understand how I feel for Jimmy? Oh dear. Oh oh oh, oh dear. Oh oh dear. - Oh ma. - Oh I'm sorry darling. It's okay mom. Oh goodness no, I just... It's okay mom. I know, I'm sorry dear, I just love you so much. I just want to hold you for a moment longer. Okay, that's all right, there we are, that's fine, I'm fine now. I'm fine now. I'm so glad we had this talk. Yes, it was a very nice talk, wasn't it dear? Yes, yes, I feel better thank you. Me too all right why don't you go and lay that lovely, perfect head of yours on that pillow upstairs in your bedroom? - Good night mom. - All right, - good night dear. - Good night. Raymond Walenski. It's not what you think. Actually it is what you think. I found him sneaking into Susie's bedroom window. Oh God, what is our daughter Susie going to think when she finds out that you killed her boyfriend? I didn't kill him. I was biting him, then I came to my senses just in time. Oh God, oh this is awful. Raymond, this is just awful. What are we going to do when he turns into a vampire Raymond? I didn't think about it. No you didn't think about that did you? Ha, that Betty is something else huh? Oh, come on guys, look I know she's a little bit older right and she's your neighbor but I promise boy I am keen over that peachy pie and I'm not gonna screw the pooch. I'm gonna take care of her because I love her. God, Bob, can't you stop talking about Betty? Can't you we've got real problems here? What happened? I bit Jimmy. You bit Jimmy? He's in the closet. He's in the closet? - Turning into a vampire. - Turning into a vampire? - Susie doesn't know. - Susie doesn't know. Would you both just stop that? Just help us please. Well this is a pickle. Okay, okay. Okay, here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna be fine. We just have to keep up appearances. And that's why we are gonna throw a cocktail party. Oh. Me flapjacks, making flapjacks. Everything looks lovely, lovely. Oh, good morning sweetheart. Good morning. I have your book bag all ready for you and alphabetized by your books, looked over you algebra, wonderful, great job, so. Where's mom? She's feeling a little under the weather with the month things. So you'll learn all about it in college university. Sorry I got mad at you last night. No no no, I'm sorry you came to me seeking advice from a medical professional and there I was acting like a crazy father. I understand. I just I really want you and mom to give Jimmy a chance. He's sweet and funny and wonderful and marvelous. Oh we just want you to be happy. Than you daddy. What was that? Nothing. That was your mother vacuuming yet again, she's a vacuumer, always vacuuming that one. So we are going to get you your breakfast. I made you a fork, just use that and then just take a little sip there, get your vitamin C and calcium. Mm, yummy yum, gee, yum. Thank you. Okay, off you go. Thanks dad. Love you, tear it and eat away, chomp chomp-a-roo. How long has it been since you were transformed? Three months ago I was normal. I was smaller. I didn't have all this hair and these teeth. And now I'm eating people. I just I just have no life. Oh well I there must be something positive about your existence. It's really hard to go home. My family, my wife, my daughter, I love that bitch. I'm still a dad. Have they accepted you? Well I don't think they have a choice. I pay the bills. - Oh, that's good. - My wife does not work. Pain in my ass, but I love her. I love her. I have nobody. I have nothing. They just keep me in my room all the time and I couldn't even eat anybody. Brains taste like, oh God let me tell you brains taste like will you assist me? You're still accounting? I work from home, so I don't see my clients. Oh good. Well our neighbor saw me for like five minutes. - And then? - He can't see anymore. Of course, ate his... Oh man, I have this sick feeling all the time. I see okay. Well William have you tried the healing power of hypnosis? Bob. Go. So where we? Sorry that just comes over you once in a while. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Good session, so off you go. Do you fly? No, I walk. Oh, well off you go. Oh yeah Raymond you're getting pretty good at this. You know that boy is still in the closet though? You should probably go check that one out. You should have just finished him off you know. Hey what are you doing with me? Put me down, put me down. What are you writing Bob? I've been working on a love poem. You want to hear it? No. My sweet Betty fills my heart with confetti. Today can be our time if you'll only be mine. What's the matter dear? Is the rhyme scheme too complicated? No. It's Jimmy. He hasn't answered my phone calls. I haven't seen him in two days. I think he broke up with me. Maybe he's sick. Or he probably joined the navy. Daddy? Can I please borrow the car to check on him? Oh I don't know if you need to leave the house, plus the car's out of gas. You shouldn't drive when you're emotional. Don't leave the house. ♪ Oh Susie ♪ You know what kiddo? Let's do get out of here. Let's get some ice cream. I'll let you drive the hearse. That's a wonderful idea isn't it? Yes, mm-hmm. Just let me grab my coat. No no, wait darling, don't go in the closet dear, because your father has just sprayed for toxic spiders, isn't that right dear? Yes dear. Okay, see, plus you're already wearing Jimmy's sweater. Oh dear, he's starting to turn Raymond. What are we going to do? I feel just awful. I wish I could undo all of this. Well that doesn't help us now does it? Okay come on Raymond, think think darling. Oh just give me a moment. - What are you doing? - Shh. Raymond! What was I supposed to do? At least he's quiet now. Raymond, I love you, but I hardly recognize you anymore. Well I hardly recognize myself. My love, I'm so very sorry. I know this has been hard on you. You've been incredibly good getting everything. I just want things to go back to normal again. Oh my darling, of course you do. And they will, I promise. Except for werewolves and the underworld and counseling the creatures of the night and bloodsucking and dead animals and teenagers and well. Pig in a blanket ladies? - Oh thank you. - Thank you so much. Hello, oh hello. Pig in a blanket? Oh, thank you. Bob, may I speak to you for a moment? Sure you mind giving us a minute here wiggles? Sure. Oh wow. - Wiggles? - Oh, you better believe it. - Where's Raymond? - I don't know. Well where could he be? Hello everyone, sorry I'm late. Oh hello darling. Where have you been? Bob, may I borrow your hearse? - You bet. - Hearse, what did you do dear? Mr. Peters. He's in the shed. No, oh Raymond. Oh, he was peaking into Betty's bedroom window. Bob, I met a guy named Bob and he is the most wonderful man that I've ever seen. He was peaking into Betty's bedroom window. My Betty's window? That's the one. Thanks Raydog. But, but but but right away. You bet. Oh oh, Raymond dear, your base nature is out of control - my darling. - Nature, I feel fine. And white whine for the lady and a red for the gentleman. It's a college football player. A toast to friends. And neighbors, mm mm mm. - To friendship. - To friendship. Everything is wonderful Natasha. Oh thank you Jane. You must have spent days cooking. Oh, it's what I love to do. Hello, hi mom, hi daddy. Oh hello sweetheart, pig in a blanket? Oh thank you. Oh, someone's thirsty. I'll be back. Oh and she's off. You look wonderful dear. Oh thank you. Sorry Raydio, I forgot the guy jumped off the bridge because he was tripping on LSD. Daddy. Daddy. Roll over. Raymond. Daddy. Oh. You can't protect your girls forever. Eventually, Susie will find out. Raymond. Daddy, I'm pregnant. It was you wasn't it? Dog murderer! Vampire! Vampire! Oh dear. Honey are you all right? - Yes just. - Well. Darling you all right dear? Why don't we go and sit down over here? - Yes. - Why your father just had too many pigs in a blanket that's all. Pigs. Would you just stand up really quick? Betty what is your last name? - Winslow. - Oh I thought it'd be more Jewish. No, it's just Winslow. Okay, Betty Winslow will you make me the happiest man on Earth and by my bride? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! - Yes, okay. Susie? Jimmy! Don't bite me! No. No, Susie! Now I can explain everything. Now I know this may seem bizarre for you, the whole vampire thing, but really dear it is quite miraculous. Your father was handpicked by yours truly and he is a very special, a very great man and us creatures of the underworld, well we need him. So if you promise not to scream, I'll promise not you bite you. Sound good? Great. Handpicked, for what why? Well your father's been treating us with our emotional well-being. Monsters are real. Monsters have feelings. Yes, why does everybody keep saying that to me? Do you have any idea what it's like to see your friends and your family wither away while you stay exactly the same? Now I don't mind the not wrinkling part, but it does get very, very lonely. Jimmy! What about him? Why is he? Well that was an accident. You can blame your father for that one. He lost his temper, but don't be mad. He will need some guidance. He's a bit simple that one. Okay, I think I understand. My father and my boyfriend are both vampires - because of you. - Yes. You've ruined our life you! My my, you are indeed your father's child. Well then why don't you come with me? I'll show you. Whoa, where we are? We are in the monster's hall of fame. Is that you? No, that is my mother Gloria. She was a real pain in the ass. Over there, is my brother Victor. He works in Transylvania. Why did you bring me here? - Well do you see that? - Yes. That is where your father's painting will go. That says Dr. Walker and my father is Dr. Walenski. Well Igor will you change that plaque already? Point is your father has a calling. What's that? Hmm, oh that. That is for your Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob? He found a new set of powers! I am Bob! And we are still trying to understand them. Let's get you back. Will I see you again? Of course, we are practically sisters now. Oh God, Raymond I'm so worried. She's been gone 12 hours now. What are you doing? No! No, stop that! You and Susie are better off without me. Raymond! You know what? Fine, go ahead kill yourself dear. I don't care whether you live or die. Why with the hitting? That's gonna leave a mark. You again? You're new here, okay I get it, look I'm here, I'm a regular. I'll be here long after you're gone. Okay, I'm here. It's Oliver, I'm here to see Dr. Walenski for 9:00 a.m. Tuesday. He's in the oven at the moment. I'm the 9:00 a.m. I'm the Tuesday 9:00 a.m. Dr. Walenski. Raymond you're nine o'clock's here. Damn it! Dr. Walenski? Oh, there you are such an honest face. I thought about what you said, not all of it, because frankly, you were projecting and that's normal, but I just feel like... Yes, can this session not happen in my kitchen unless you want to chop onions with me, I suggest you follow him into his office. Thank you very much. I'm the dark. I'm afraid of me, right, right? Yeah, that's very true. I just need you to say everything's gonna be okay. Right this way Oliver. Everything's gonna be okay. Can you just say everything's gonna be okay? - This way. - Okay right this. Oh, for goodness sake. Dr. Walenski, Dr. Walenski. There's stairs. Please sit down. I love you both, but I'm very disappointed in your actions. What we did was inexcusable. I'm very sorry. I hate that you both lied to me. And we are so very, very sorry aren't we? When your father was bitten, we made a pact that we would protect you no matter what. We didn't want you to be scared darling. I'm very sorry about Jimmy. It's okay. It's understandable. Oh. You are so grown up. We were wrong not to have told you. That's all I wanted to hear. Hypermesisangrivadarum? Yes well. Does Uncle Bob know? He brings your father cadaver blood from the mortuary. Now I've come to learn that there's a lot more to this world than we could have ever imagined. I was recruited by the Goddess of the Underworld, Victoria to provide counsel to the creatures of the underworld. It turns out monsters have a lot of emotional issues. Goddess? Yes dear. Is she beautiful? I suppose. Did she do anything other than bite you? Natasha. Well what else am I supposed to think when a beautiful goddess comes for my husband? So dad, will you live forever? Yes dear. Crosses? No. Holy water? Garlic? Oh that's a myth. I put lots of garlic in that brisket that you like that you can't eat anymore. That brisket was divine. Thank you dear. Is there anything else you two would like to tell me? Well I have incredibly heightened sense of hearing. Have you heard my private conversations with Jimmy? Oh God, his parents must be so worried about him. Well his parents are dead. Oh good. I love you both. We love you darling. Oh. Well hey-o, hey-o, what a beautiful morning indeed. Oh well somebody's feeling so much better today aren't they? Yes, thank you Bob. No really Natasha, thank you ever so much for the most wonderful cocktail party last night. Oh, yes it was rather special wasn't it dear? Yes dear. - It really was special. - It was so special. - It really was. - You're special. - You're special. - Oh I could eat you up. Do it. Oh Betty can I see your ring? Oh my would you look at that? - That is... - Isn't it beautiful? Beautiful! I stole it from a body. There was a pretty bad house fire. I love it. And I love you. I love you. Come here you. Oh you had a big breakfast. You make me so hungry. Oh darling. Oh. I love you, I love you. Wait, my back, my back. Hi Jimmy. Hey Susie. I'm sorry I ran away like that last night. It was just all so unexpected. I guess I got scared. I understand. So you have fangs now? Can I see them? I am proud to be guiding these lost souls, these monsters of the underworld. Group therapy is really doing wonders for everyone, realizing we are not alone in this. The whole vampire thing hasn't been so bad. My daughter finally thinks I'm cool. My wife finds me irresistible. And Bob moved out. He's just across the street, but he's not here, so. My daughter's teenage vampire boyfriend lives here now and he's like the son I never had or wanted. Well it's all perspective really. I will outlive everyone I know. I will watch my beautiful wife and daughter age and die in front of me as I remain like this forever. I may have to drink the blood of a human from time to time, but I never pick anyone who doesn't deserve it. All in all I have been chosen and I am honored to be a pivotal part of the dark world.
