The average film is always the same. It's some exaggerated catalyst which turns the existing world completely upside down which in turn, forces our so called hero, to enter into this new world of the unknown. He then predictably reaches that infamous "all is lost" moment," where there's just no more hope. But it's how he deals with this moment, that gives the audience their emotional response. This is not that kind of film. [moaning] [Door slams shut] At any given time, there are over 300 active serial killers in the united states alone. Many walk among us with complete anonymity. Some of them may live in your neighborhood. Some of them, you may even know. And some of them, may actually be justified. "You stupid fuck!" "You want a climax to your film?" "I'll give you a climax" "And I'm gonna get the fucking credit". "Try to edit that!" My name is Travis Simon. This is my story... Sort of. [Rock and Roll music] [phone rings] [ANSWERING MACHINE] "This is Lane, leave a message" [beep] [VOICE ON MACHINE] "Little turd! You're so dead you don't even know it" "C'mon boy, bring it! Bring it!"

[phone ringing] [ANSWERING MACHINE] "This is Lane, leave a message" [beep] [Voice on machine] "This is officer Jarvis from the Dept or corrections, trying to reach Lane Mitchell Hayes" "You missed your last two appointments with the department and are required by law to appear before the court" "or you will be on violation of your parolle" "Please contact the department within 48 hours or there will be a warrant for your arrest. Thank you." Where the hell is it? [screamming] You think you can take my coke? Was it you plan? Wait till I was asleep? Where ya going? Please, no! I'm not done yet. Ginger... Leave me alone! C'mon baby. I know you'll like it... Open the door. Leave alone! Open the door. Open the door! Hello? I need help!...Hello? Yes, so you guys want one sixty- millimeter non-sync film camera, two wide-angle, you want two? two wide-angle adaptors?" Hey it's Lane, sorry I didn't call you back, uhh, I was out... Dude, are you kidding me?" -Any change for food? -No, just eat that! Jeez, man! -Spare change? -NO! Bless you. Ah, yeah, everthing here looks good...watch your head guys! OK, good. So, everything is set. We have the three-ton grip package, four HMI's, tripod, steady-cam dolly which we'll give fifty feet of track for it, ah, also a twenty-two-inch HD Director's Monitor. Ok Great. What about power? Ah, ah...Jake, we still got that genny, right? Ah, Richard found a buyer for it, but we can keep it till we close. OK good. So, you will get power, which is good. Ah, we're also gonna give you... -six long-range walkies, and four private radios. -Sounds good. Dad, can we get some lunch? Yes sweetheart, as soon as we're done here. -Hey Travis, Harry just dropped this off for you. -Oh, excellent. -Is this it? -This is it. -Alright. -Why didn't you call to wake me up? -Yea, I tried calling. Called at 6:30, 7:30 and 8:30. Alright, so this's it. This is what you've been waiting for. This is the vest. What you can do in your film, your actor can wear this. Pay attention, this is the rig. This my partner, Harry Hawke designed this. This is the pack you wear for the actors when you do the stab scene. Now what it does, it goes over the shoulders, comes around the waist, Cool thing about this though it's invincible. So if you stab it with a knife, the blade can't go through your actor's always protected. So now you can get the wide shot of the knife going in and it's beautiful. Ah, when you're done, reload your blood pack, and, you guys are ready to reshoot. -Incredible. Let's do it. -Excellent. Ok, so, here's your list here. Go through the inventory make sure everything's on here, we haven't missed anything. You know what's not written there? Crazy hooker last night. Also that your PO called the office again this morning? Yeah, I know. Left a message. I don't care. Whatever. Sleep through that one? That's funny. None of this matters. You know why it doesn't matter? This place is going under guys in 30 days. And I've got 30 days to find a new job. And if I don't, guess what happens? I go back to jail. That's where all the big boys if we break the law. How's that sound? Yea. See, I got arrested for beating the crap out of a prostitute. While dealing cocaine. Well, it wasn't just cocaine, it was the funner stuff: meth, crystal, crank, speed, glass. Mr. Wolff, I'm sorry. Dude, seriously? Really? Is that what you want to do this morning? -Yea, I'm doing it. Why not? -That's ok. I'm sorry. Wait. I don't want to direct or offend and the Director here is making a movie right? Sorry. -Let me tell'ya something. -Yeah? I don't like the way you talk around my daughter. Do you understand that? Show some respect. -She's 15-years old. -You know what? Touching. You felt me. Right here. In fact why don't you cry me some tears, Mr. director? why don't you go direct an "After-School Special?" Thanks a lot. I'll have my guys pick this... Pick up the stuff afternoon. -I appreciate it. -I appreciate it. Thanks Mr. Wolff. I am sorry -C'mon, let's get something to eat. -Sorry about this. We all appreciate it. Everything you're doing out there. -Dude, that's one of our biggest clients here. Why are you doing this? -Oh well, oh well. Dude, get me some food I'm starving right now. Seriously, that's why I act this way. I had a bite of a roll out there. Some Black homeless guy, -Candyman looking-guy scared the crap out of me. -Hola. Hola. Hi, Pizza, can I get something to go please? No esta Travis. No? donde esta? No No, no. Necesito, necesito ahora. -What does that mean? -Shut up. [loud bell] -Can you take this please? -Yeah, I got it. I got it. ok -No! Ahora, ahora. Right, so we got the chroma key for you, and you wanted, was it, four, four animation stands? Yep. Just tell your guy to bring his truck back. Pick it up. Alright, thanks. [phone beep] -Hey buddy... - Yea? - Yeah, come to the front and help me out for a minute? -Travis, hey, this here is... -Susan Lanier! -Yeah. Ah, I actually studied you in film school. Excuse me? I'm sorry, I didn't study you, I studied Hills Have Eyes. We watched Hills Have Eyes. You played Brenda in the movie. This is...this is, wow! You know, the first film you did actually got an X rating when it first came out, because of the scene that you did, they had to recut the entire thing just to get an R so it could be released in theaters. I'm sorry. You know we, I had a meeting with Richard to go over the inventory list. Richard's out of town. I'm Travis Simon. Hi. -It's nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. I'm acting manager, so whatever you guys need, I can help you out with. You know Suze is actually directing a film called Deadpan and, Gabby Stone's gonna be starring in it. -It's actually Gabrielle -Yeah, whatever. Um, are you in any way related to Dee Wallace Stone? Yea, that's my mom. -That's pretty cool. -Who's Dee Wallace Stone? Ah, Dee Wallace Stone, played the mom in E.T. I never saw that, what is that? Uh, what the fuck is the matter with you? Wow, really? -So, Deadpan right? Is that... -Yes, uh huh. Sure. Oh, ah...Oh wow! you guys are actually shooting on 35 film. That's, that's great. Yeah, you know it's really the only way to do it right. Do it right huh? Is that what you're doing these days, doing it right? You still, active? Active? Like physically? Well yeah, I do yoga, do jogging. No I mean physically as in sexually, like this shit. You get that on? -Hey, you know what -Gabrielle. -No, It's fine. To actually work in this business, it pays to have a little bit of class and act professional. Act professional? Are you serious? First of all that's bull-shit In this business it pays to sleep with someone higher on the food chain. -Great! -You know, it's really too bad Thatabout the younger...now. generation of film-makers and what they have become You know, they have no respect for the craft, none whatsoever because it's so easy to do this, and any idiot with a digital camera can call themselves a film maker. Wow, you know is this lecture Lane day? That's great! you guys are like part time psychologists? I don't like that. Ok, first of all I have a nice tip for you: there's the door, how's that sound, you like that? Why don't you just tell Richard that we stopped by and uh, have him call me, ok? We'll tell good old Dick you stopped by. We'll tell everyone here in the office you stopped by for Dick. How's that sound huh? Let's get out of here. Let's. Fucking asshole! Oh yea, "It's a walk off. It's a walk off. Remember that movie? Seriously? -Yeah. -Seriously? -What? -You know I had to beg Richard... -Ah, da da da! I hate that stupid story, I know You had to beg him, you thought I would be an assest -Yea, I thought you might be an asset. -Yea, so? Doesn't matter. In about three weeks we're gonna be jobless anyway. -Why not go out in style? -Yea, I think you'll go out in style. I know I will. I just did. You won't. Pansy. Hi. Grow some balls. I have church bells, you have tic- tacs. How's that feel? Great huh? -Wow. -Yeah exactly. Oh by the way, I saw you looking at Gabby. You like her, don't you? -Seriously? -Yea that's why I went for the other one, give you a chance for once. Man up. How does it feel to not be a man? Yeah, exactly. -I like brunettes. -Oh ok. Good excuse. I like red heads too, but guess what? Where's the light stand? Going up! I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing here. With all these chicks around, this director is trying to make himself a cameo put himself in the movie. I guess the director can do whatever he wants, right? Yea, If you're Alfred Hitchcock. Sounds like something Lane would do. I don't know why you keep that guy around. Don't worry about me. I've got him under control. Aren't you shooting video? Richard wants to document all this. I'm taking stills. Who's doing video? -Hey ladies! -Hey -Hey We're doing a little, kind of behind the scenes DVD. Kind of bonus footage, you get bored one night, you wanna stick something in, you know? Cool. -Nice. You guys seem pretty comfortable on camera. -Yeah. -You guys ever work together before? -No, first time. -first time. -First time for everything right? -I guess so. Good attitude, I like it. I love it. You guys look really... OK, Swimsuit ladies, I'm gonna need you. Now. Let's go. Now. Roundin'. Up. No, no, no! What the hell are you doing? This is supposed to be a professional set! It's just a camera setting. Look in your monitor.It's fine! Jesus, I know how to film. What's wrong man? Look at this guy... this director. He knows nothing about film making Nothing. He can't set up a shot, he can't direct an actor. He doesn't know anything about it. But someone gave him all this money to make this big hot-rod car movie, and he hires these good looking people with tits and ass, and he thinks he's got something special. Dude... Tits and ass, that's kind of, that's pretty special. I'm just saying. These girls let me tape them. Thought I was part of the production. Hey Lane. How's it going? You get some good footage of the girls? I thought you would be shooting the guys with your prison background and everything. But I guess you didn't really see that many guys, right? In prison, face down in the pillow, teeth full of pillow. Yea, nice head-lamp fuck-stick. Who's taping girls? I am. Ooh, speaking of taping girls, you gotta see the prostitute I taped last night. Hot! [loud sex sounds] [phone rings] Hey, what's up? Did you watch it? Uh, yeah, I'm watching it right now. What did you think? She's pretty hot, huh? There is absolutely no cinematic value in anything that you shot, alright? She doesn't even stay in frame. This is absolutely ridiculous. Yeah, but she's hot right? Ah, yeah. Yeah. I guess so. What are you doing right now? I'm working on a film project. Really? Yeah, after... being on that set tonight, I started thinking about it, you know, and and really, really reliving the movies like Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity and how they made those movies for absolutely nothing. They shot them on these cheap little video cameras and I just you knonw, thought you know maybe I could do something like that. Where the hell you gonna find actors? You know, maybe, maybe get real people and just scare them or something. I mean we have all the equipment in our warehouse to make whatever we want. Why don't we just borrow some of that gear and do that. We? Well, I could use some help on this. -I don't know. - Look, with everybody Richard knows in distribution around town, I'm sure we could get this thing sold and, you know, probably make some pretty good money, if that's something you would be interested in. Yeah, I will take the money wherever I can find it. -If you are down, man let's just talk about it in the morning. - Cool. -Alright, talk to you then. Oh wow, you are actually on time today. Alright, I have been giving this a lot of thought. I really think that our idea of the movie can work, but we gotta put a little more thought into it. We can't just run and scare somebody, because that's not a movie. If we figure out a way to make this come full circle, maybe throw in a few twists, things like that That's what wins an audience, that's what makes it marketable, that's what we have to do, I mean if we had a girl in the middle of a room and we run in with a sheet on our head or a knife, ohhhh, I mean, that's not going to work. We need to get our angles right so when the shoot gets out of frame then we can have our sound effects of the screamming, we can have the blood, the knife coming through the frame, whatever to make it look real. So... I was thinking about it last night, I wrote this script, I think that... OK, Hold on, stop, wait just for a second. Look I know you are thirty steps ahead of everybody at all times, I get that, but this time...just stick a camera in the corner somewhere and capture it raw. You can't go raw for this, It's not going to work. Hey girls -How you doing? -Good. -Did you get some coffee? -Did you get some breakfast? -Yeah. Yeah, because I haven't had breakfast. I have been here working, ok? I got this whole list, of things, I gotta do today 'Cause I am at work, that's what I am doing, ok? This isn't the parole board, OK? It's not work furlough! We work here. That's what we do. It's a business. Alright, yeah OK. Got it. And just 'cause you are the boss here for the next couple of weeks,...just joking [laughing] Just joking. But I'm serious. We gotta lot of stuff to do and I need you helping me. -I got it. -And I'm doing it all by myself. -Got it, yeah. so, if you could help, that would be great. That's what you are here for. Is to work. Guess what, you said that. Got it. Got it. Alright, so I will see you in about 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6... I fucking hate that guy. Wow, step up from your place, huh? Figured I'd treat my best girl right. [coughs] Ah! Same shit you had last time. I got to introduce you to my guy. Alright. I'll be right out. What are you doing? She's gonna see you in here. What the hell you want me to do? this isn't exactly a film set here. You can't be in here. Where am I supposed to go? There's no place else to film. I gotta hide behind a stupid curtain. Are you kidding me? How am I gonna make a movie out of that? Trust me, I know what I'm getting with this girl. You capture it on tape, don't worry about what the fuck I'm gonna do. I know how to scare a prostitute. You get it on tape. Now, get in there, on tape now. Now! What's wrong? Dick not work today? You are still dressed. Yea, I know. Usually you're like ready to cum the second I walk in the door. I know, I just, today is just a little different. You know. I just... You're gonna get undressed or should I just stand here? No I'm good, I'm good. I already got my money so it's up to you sweetie. -You ready? -Yea -Yea, you sure? -Yeah. [loud music playing nextdoor] Hold on. what? [loud music continues] Sorry about that dude. Sorry! Can I help you? You're loud. Oh I'm sorry man, we'll try and keep it down a little. Hey guys can we keep it down a little? We are working next door, I may.... [music playing louder] He's back. Shh! guys, he's back. Shhh! [knock on door] Roy, what are you gonna do? [in a girl's voice] Who is it? Shhh! [all laughing] Yes, can I help you? We're working. I need you to keep it down, understood? -Yeah. -What? Hu? -Yes! -Hey, what the hell? -One more step it's your last hippy. We clear? Yes sir. We'll keep it down. Hey turn it off! Turn off the music. Turn it off! You are gonna fuckin' tape me without telling me? huh? Is that your game mother fucker? You put this shit online so you can make some money? Is that your plan? Yeah, slut cam A. That's really fuckin' cute. Really fuckin' cute! Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm not a God damn fucking porn star. I'm a professional call girl. Don't ever call me again! and you know, if you wanted to tape me, even include him, all you had to do was ask. I'm not gonna talk about this anymore. Look, I know you are good at running camera, but we can't just run around shooting stuff. I will take care of tomorrow night. It's a little ghetto around here, I know. Why are we coming this way? Just. Listen, just bear with me. You're taping this, right? Yeah. At least now you know why we can't get somebody that we already know. It's not going to work. I mean, I don't have a problem getting a prostitute or something. That's fine, but... At least that way, we know we can scare her. That's why we're here. I thought we were supposed to start down on 17th street. No, this place is much better. [smash on window] Ah! Jesus! Fuckin' relax! We're locked in. What do you expect? Look where we're at. Why are you turning down here, man? Nobody's down here. Yeah, there are. Just gotta know where to look. -What are you talking about? -Just trust me. I do this enough, more than I should. Ah, yes, yes, yes! What did I say? Roll the window down. Roll it down. Well, hey there cutie. School get out early today? Nice. Hi. Can we... can we have some sex? -Whoa! -Dude, dude... Hold on there sweetheart. We're just out looking for dates. It's dates. It's code word. Not sex, dumbass. Which I never understood why you call it dates. There's no dating. No ones dating. We're fucking. That's all we're doing. You know that. I'm Lolita and this here's Tanqueray. Shit. How old are you? I'm 18. Are you kidding me? Are you guys ok being videotaped? Yeah, just extra charge. Girl on girl. -Whatever, yeah -Watch out. Do we have a problem here, fellas? Ah, no we don't. We're good. We're sorry. -We were just talking. -You were just talking? Well this shit ain't for free. You understand me? You know what? My bad. We're out here. -You do that. -OK. -Go the other motherfucking way! -I know. I know. Move this piece of shit! -What's the matter with you? -Owww! Jamal, you're hurting me. Pick up the camera. Pick up the camera. What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop! Ahhh! My leg. My leg.

Fuck! Fucking bitches! [dogs barking at a distance] Well, that didn't go according to plan. Oh really. You think? We gotta get out of this fucking neighborhood. Shit! Just calm down. We didn't do anything wrong. You want to put that under the seat. Don't say a word. Let me talk to the guy. Would you roll your window all the way down sir? Let's see your license and registration, please? What is the nature of your inquiry, Sir? License and registration, please. Ah, no sir, we don't have to show you license and registration until you tell us the nature of the inquiry. Sir, I'm speaking with this gentleman right here. And I am very politely speaking with you too here, Officer, Underhill? Sir, put the video camera down. It's actually my first amendment constitutional right, sir to video tape you and all interactions with you as it is a form of free expression. Sir... It's also CA state Civil Code 120477, which if you read your manual, and I believe at some point, you were required to do that, it is not required for a citizen to show any form of identification to any officer of the law unless first given that nature of the inquiry and since you have yet to provide us with any significant reason, you're acting outside the Constitutional fold of government. Therefore Officer Underhill, we do politely decline to show you our license and registration. Sir. I pulled you over because you're a suspicious vehicle in a known gang neighborhood. Are we suspicious because we're two caucasian males driving in a non- caucasian neighborhood? No. Sir... You have still yet to provide us with any reason on the nature of inquiry on why you have stopped us. But if we are in a known gang neighborhood as you say we are, then you may really wanna rethink your next few moments. Because as we're sitting in this truck all safe and sound, here you are, an officer of the law, standing out there unprotected and there maybe someone around here who just wants to take a shot at you. So, it's your call Officer Underhill. I want you two to be on your way. Yes sir. Yes sir. Oh shit! Dude, that was awesome! How do you know all of that California State Code shit? I don't. I just made it up. Yeah, right! Evidently, he doesn't know it either. Hey, don't worry. That cop can't do shit. He knows we have him on film. We can post it online. You act like this isn't even a big deal. This is the fun part. We have a cop, hookers... a pimp getting run over by a truck, what more do you want? I wanna direct! Just... let me be the one to pick out the girl. Let's do it! [rock music playing] Ooh, ooh, look right there! Look, look. Right there. Right there. Right there! Du bist spaet. Wir ein...umm, uh.. wir habin ein problem gehabt. What? what is that? What'd she say? I think...she asked if we want dates? OK, yeah, yeah. We want dates. OK, ask her, right now, if she works alone... or if she has some crazy-assed pimp holding her chain. Ask her. Say it. I do work alone and no, I don't have crazy ass-pimp holding chain. "Ass-pimp." I like her. Umm... How much for a date with him for tomorrow night? You mean how many roses I like on first date? Stupid code word for.. yeah, yeah. OK, 75 roses, ok, tomorrow night? ohh...You waste my time! Hold on, ok, Hold on. -Dude, she's... -I know that. I know. Stop. Hold on I know that. This is what I do. Let me do my thing. I'll take care of this. Hey. Hey! Don't walk away. Come here. Look, in America, this is how we do things. I give you an offer, you give one back. It's called negotiating sweetheart. I don't play game. Two hundred roses. I do anything you want. Two hundred roses. -I'll do it. -You sure? -I'll cover it. Two hundred "Roses" tomorrow. Where do we meet you? Tomorrow night, come here. Nine O'clock. Bring cash. We have a fun date. Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh, I want to hit that. I didn't know you speak German. A little. You can't be seen because she's expecting to be with me. Just let me... think about this and figure it all out. What the hell are you so nervous for? She's a prostitute. She's going to like you regardless. You paid for her. I just don't know why I have to be the one to do this. Because I'm the one doing the scaring. Yeah! and we saw how well that went last time. Right, you didn't scare her. I sure as hell didn't scare her. She punched me in the face. Every big horror movie has got like a larger than life bad guy. You got like Freddie, Jason, Leatherface. You have these guys that do the job. I think we gotta find somebody like that. We gotta find some... some big, dark, scary something to come out and do this. OK, where you going to find this person now? We have 15 minutes til you're meeting your girl. I don't know. There's all kinds of shady people walking around the warehouse. There's got to be someone who can do it. I got it. I know just the guy. I got it. You sure about this? Ah yeah. I'm the only one with the keys so we should be OK. What's with the plastic? Oh! uh, they're going to be painting in here, so we should be alright. Alright. So, its $200 for an hour? Yeah. Good Ah, here. [music playing] Yeah. Is it OK if I am filming you? It's your hour baby. Have you ever been on camera before? No. We're good, right? You know what you're doing? Hey! We're good, right? Hey! Yeah. "Yeah" we're good or "yeah" you don't know what we're talking about? Yeah. Look, let's try this. Look at me, I look at you. We communicate...hey, Hi! We look at each other. We communicate. That's what goes on here. Take this. I want you to walk in there. You're gonna waive it around. You're gonna scare the shit out of her, right? -Like in the movies? -Shhh!...What? What? What? Are you hearing anything I'm saying? What did we agree on? I'm gonna give you one hundred dollars cash. You're gonna be a big movie star after this. Is that good? Is that getting through? OK, now look. I can't go in there. I can't get in the shot. But I'm going to watch right here on that monitor. It's... Look scary, whatever. You smell like shit! Seriously. Are you ready? Go. Now, now, now. Go! [screams] Are you kidding? [screams continue] I'm going to go lock up in the back. [Tap on window] Excuse me sir, can I help you? Uh, no. I work here. I don't have anyone scheduled here for tonight. What's your name? Lane... Lane Hayes. I work for Richard. We're all done. I'm just waiting for my buddy to lock up. We ran a little behind, um, tonight... Just... Sir, it's 4:30 in the morning. If you guys are going to be in after hours you need to fill out a security work order so we know you're here. We don't want someone accidentally getting shot. Yes sir. We're all cleaned up. Let's go. Mr. Simon... Working late tonight? Yeah. [voice on walkie-talkie] "All units, we have a possible vagrant siting outside Building 12" I'm on it. OK gentlemen, have a nice evening. OK, let's get out of here. Go. You want a hand with that? No. I got it. When the tide rolls in, it should take the body out with it. We'll be alright. If you think so. This looks so real. That's because it was real. What do you want to do now? I don't know. I don't know, I mean... I mean, we didn't do anything. Right? I mean we didn't do anything. It was the guy. The guy came in there... The guy came in there, with a knife and slit her throat. He came there man, and slit her throat, gosh, just... God! why did you tell him to come in there and slit her throat? I didn't tell him to do anything! I told him wave the knife around and scare her. That's what I said. Yeah, he did. He scared her... and he killed her. We didn't do anything. We're ok. We're ok. We gotta call the cops on this. Ok, calm down. Think this thing through. I am thinking it through. What are you going to tell the cops? We paid some deranged homeless man... to put a knife up to the neck of some prostitute, and then tape it for fun, and then he slices her throat and then you... wanna drop the body off into the ocean? We dumped her body, ok? We are accomplices to murder. I'm on probation. If I even sneeze in the wrong direction... I go to jail for a long time. That's not gonna happen. We covered our tracks. We're fine! We're not gonna to get caught. Tell me you didn't feel that rush? That adrenaline! A dead body in the back of a truck with a security guard right there and then us driving all over town knowing that any second we can get caught, but we didn't. That's a fucking rush and you know it! No drug can fix that, no high, no pill, no needle can ever top that! I know you fucking felt that! It's a prostitute. She's a bad person. Nobody's gonna miss a bad person. a diseased-filled hooker.

[News on TV] And now we have an update on the disturbing news in North Hollywood where earlier today, a body was found dumped inside a large trash bin of a local business Police and crime scene investigators have been on the scene all morning trying to make sense of everything everything. We now go live on the scene to Christina Calderon with the latest. we are here live only a few hours after a local drifter discovered a decapitated man's body inside a large dumpster. Earlier today, I spoke with the man who only wanted to be referred to as Terry. I was cleaning up the city getting cans and bottles and get a little bit a food, place to stay. I went to that can over there, opened it up and I just... There was this person in there with his head chopped off! It scared me man! I gotta get outta here. And Tracy, the most disturbing part is that the body was found several blocks away from Saint Paul's Elementary School, which has many parents very nervous. I think everyone that I've spoken to were just shocked. You just don't expect this to happen in your community. I mean, I know there are people out there that are sick and they're crazy, You don't expect them to be right here. I was walking past this area this morning when I took my daughter to school. It's just shocking. At the moment police have locked down the scene and are still looking for clues . Residents, especially those with small children, are advised to stay home after dark. Back to you in the studio. [On TV] Well folks, we do have pretty severe weather moving in as you can see here on our radar. Lots of heavy patches of rain moving into the L.A. basin. Some areas are gonna see 2-3 inches of rain. Mountains ah, looking at snow at the very high elevations and it's time to get out your galoshes. Ah, This's probably going to last the next 18 to 24 hours and then start clearing up and we can get back into our bathing suites. Back to you Tracy. Never been here before. Jamal would kill me if he knew I was here with you right now. He's not gonna find out. I can't believe you hit him with that truck! [whimpering] [screams] No sugar, right? What's the matter with you? Those flickering lights were insane really. I know they were so bad on my eyes. [music playing] [singing country music] [On the TV] We're having some pretty strong storm activity over greater Los Angeles We're gonna have thunder and lighting. Some possible showers here and there... and it's gonna make for some very interesting weather and sometimes dangerous in certain areas. So be careful out there. That's the weather back to you Tracey. [On the TV] Two headless female bodies were found early this morning and police are now saying this could be the work of a possible serial killer. There is however speculation that today's findings could be the result of a possible copy-cat. Police are urging anyone with information to contact the crime report hot-line right away. [crying] Help! Help me, please help me! Hey Lane, what the hell are you doing, man? You wanted her in the film, I got her in the film. Help! please help me! We don't have to pay her.

You've got a front row seat to your own death-bed you fucking bitch! You know what? I fucking like that! Do it again, right in my mouth. -I wanna see you make a fucking death-film right now.

Fuck! Fuck!! [Dogs barking] Yeah, everything's all set. No, I agree, between the tripod cam and the ones we got in the ceiling, I really think we've got everything covered.... Yeah, no, the meeting with the film office guy went really well. In fact, he wants to meet again next week. Hopefully, we can go ahead and finalize. Yeah, I just picked up the footage so that I can finish the edit. I'm just worried about the ending though. No, I'm gonna meet her as soon as I leave here tonight. [loud slam] I don't know. Let me call you back. Yeah, that's a good idea. You're going to close the deal without me? Is that your plan? How you doing Lane? You know, the first time you kill someone, it may not be as... easy as you think to get over. I still have dreams about it. You know, you do it a couple more times, it becomes a little easier. That is true, what they say. Sit down. Sit down, Travis. You think you're a pretty smart guy, huh? You know, in the beginning... we talked about making a movie. You know, scaring people. Making it look real. Things changed a little bit, huh? You know, in the end, it kind of became real. Yeah... Then it became real convenient for you. Now I'm the one taking the chances. I'm the one making shit happen. Oh, and I love your whole... surveillance camera thing. That was genius. You didn't think I saw that, huh? So, what? Are you just gonna shoot me? What? Cheat the audience? No way. So where do we go from here? You wanna burn me? You think you can burn me? Now, it's your turn to burn. [screams] [laughs] Come on man, that's the best you got? Come on Lane, the cameras are rolling, man! Oh, I've got a lot more than that, as you've already seen. Yeah, that's right. I've seen it. I couldn't have done this without you. You are my star. What the hell you talking about? Come on Lane, you, you really think it's a coincidence, huh? That you, an ex-con with a prison record and a history of violence towards women would actually get hired here? Or that you just happen to meet these... random people who could solve all of your problems. -Are you kidding me? -Spare change for food? -No! eat that!" Harry Hawke. And this is my assistant Chloe Jo. She just finished making a film in Germany. Did you pick up any German while you were there? Du bist spaet. Wir habin ein problem -I saw you looking at Gabby. You like her, don't you? -I like brunettes. I think she asked if we want dates? OK, yeah, yeah. We want dates. You set me up. Yeah! I couldn't afford actors. I couldn't afford some elaborate production, but I didn't have to because you did that for me. You were my prostitute. You were my bitch. And I didn't have to pay you a dime. And I didn't have to pay you a dime! No. bull shit! I saw her die? Fuck you, man! No. No, you didn't. You saw what I wanted you to see. ,You saw exactly what I placed in front of you, for you to think. Camera off! You alright? Yeah. Go!

What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes! You want a hand with that? I got it You gave me everything I need to get this film sold and make me the best first time director ever.

You take that knife right now, and just stab me in the heart. Think about it! We've got the greatest ending ever right now. We've got good versus evil in the ultimate head to head battle.

Let's fucking do this right now! You stab me in the heart and you fucking kill me. Get it on film. Think of the ending, man! 'Cause, you can kill me!... but I'm in the movie. That means I live forever. You stupid fuck. You want a climax to your film? I'll give you a climax... and I'm gonna get the fucking credit! Yeah, try to edit that! [panting] [gun shot] [Weather report] A beautiful day in sunny Los Angeles this afternoon We have sunny skies, a light breeze and warm temperatures. Currently is 82 degrees here in Hollywood... 70's at the beaches, and we are looking at the low 90's in the Valleys... The whole thing just looked so real. This is really gonna be fun. I'm excited to release it. Well you know, if it wasn't for the effects of my man Harry here, none of that would have been made possible. Ha Ha Industries? Yeah, I think that it kind of laughs at ya. [Everyone laughs] When Travis first brought me this idea, I just knew right away that it was something special... ...But you had to have done just right, otherwise, you couldn't pull it off. I stand behind my work. So my partner Harry Hawke designed this. This is the pack you wear for the actors when you're doing the stab scene. The cool thing about though, is that it's invincible. So if you stab it with a knife, the blade can't go through. Your actor's always protected. See. It's going to revolutionize the film industry. So what do you think Mr. Phillips. we have a deal? We have more than a deal my friend. As a matter of fact, I'd like to green-light the sequel and we should discuss the franchise rights as well. Let's do the deal. -Here we go. -We got it! We got it! We got it! Yes we did. We're gonna have a lot of work to do if we plan to do a next one. -Well, hold on a second guys... -Exactly We gotta talk about safety first before we talk about another one 'cause I'm not taking another... crowbar to the skull! [all laugh] So what do you think Mr. Hawke. You, ah, ready for a sequel? I think I'm ready to "shoot" again. And I'm ready to speak German again. [Newscast] Beautiful weather for the next few days... and back to you, Tracey These warm days have been nice, but it does look like storms are headed our way. Switching gears: It appears than an anonymous source has lead police to recover the gun used in he shooting of Lane Mitchell Hayes who was currently out of jail on parole. The gun belonged to Francis Jamal Jefferson, a known drug dealer and prostitution ring-leader. Police believe that the death of Hayes was most likely drug and prostitution related given his prior history. Jefferson's currently being held without bail. Now we switch gears to entertainment news, where the question still remains: where is Gabrielle Stone? Why don't you just let me act in this and you can focus on directing. I already set up the cameras You can't be seen because shes expecting to be with me. But I get to act in the next one, right? Keep the vest tight. Harry's gonna be in a half an hour to put the blood packs on you. -You good? -Yeah. Listen, aren't we supposed to go this? Like go over safety stuff? What's the matter with you? And people are wondering if the disappearance is part of a publicity stunt. We'll have the answer to that mystery at 11.
