Once upon a time, in india, there lived a king. He was a good king. Kind, generous, took care of his people... in a beautiful city in india called nainital One day, he heard there was a monster in his lake He didn't like monsters, man. He was like... i gotta take care of this monster So he dives right into this dark lake... and grapples with the monster and fights with him and all of that, and then boom! He pulls it out of the lake But it’s not a monster! It’s this beautiful fishwoman ! She pleads with him and she says... "you have to put me back in the water, otherwise i'm gonna die. " So... he puts her back in the water and he goes back to his palace, and... he tries to get back to his work, but he can't work anymore. He can't eat, he can't sleep So, he goes back to the lake and he says “alright, gotta find my beautiful fishwoman.? He dives into the lake, and he searches and searches. No luck Then he starts praying to his favorite god. Lord rama. And lord rama comes before him and says... if you wanna be reunited with the fishwoman, you have to become… Half-Fish, half-Man yourself. You have to give up your kingdom, you have to give up... everything, and you have to go live with her in the lake” The king says, “i accept” And he gets reunited with the beautiful fishwoman ! It’s boring. I hate romantic stories Why couldn't the king just pull out a gun and... bang! Bang! Bang! Man, you guys are tough. Yeah ! Hey, i'm sorry about last night Its my fault. I shouldn't have gotten so drunk. No, no, no ! Its my fault. I mean, i shouldn't have let you drink that much. Ok. Fair is fair. It’s our fault. Fifty-Fifty. Fifty-Fifty ! Sapna.
