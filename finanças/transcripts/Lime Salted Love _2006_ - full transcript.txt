IT'S THE ROOM THAT IS ALL... GRAY. IT'S NOT QUITE... QUITE... QUITE BLACK. IRREVERSIBLY... GRAY. IT'S THE ROOM WHERE YOU LET IT ALL... GO. IT HURTS INSIDE... THE DARK... HALLWAY. OPPOSITE END OF WHEREVER YOU ARE. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS. NO ONE KNOWS. I WISH I COULD TELL SOMEONE. TELL ME. I CAN'T, NATALIE. NOTHING'S SAFE. NOTHING'S EVER SAFE. IT NEVER STOPS. IT NEVER... STOPS. Both: CLOSE YOUR EYES. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WHAT'S THAT? LIFE. LIFE. LIFE. LIFE. Hey, David. What's up? It's me, man. I haven't talked to you since New Year's. I'm sure you're probably pretty busy, but, look, man, I'm sorry to bother you. I just, um, wanted to call you because I know how... I say that you weren't there and that you could have stopped it if you were. Well, man, I think we both know that that's not true. I can't forget about him. That means that, uh... our brother Charlie... would be alive if it weren't for me. It was like it was yesterday. It was that car. It was the blood everywhere. His blood was everywhere. His blood was everywhere, David. All this time that I thought that you were the bad brother, and it was my fault. I know I haven't been a good brother. I'm sorry for everything. Bye. DAVY? DAVID? DAVID! YOU LOOK GOOD, DAVID. WAKE UP, SLEEPING BEAUTY! SLINK. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? YOU MEAN J.C.? NO. NO. NOT THE SON OF... BUT GOD. DAVID. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE, DAVID. DO YOU THINK HE'LL LET ME GO? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, DAVID? EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS FAKE. IT'S THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T SEE... THAT ARE REAL. IT'S TIME... TO JUST... LAY BACK AND LET THE POWERS THAT BE BE. YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL OF IT ANYMORE, DAVID. HE'S GIVING YOU HIS PAIN, DAVID. HE'S GIVING YOU HIS PAIN! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! SO, THE UNKNOWN VISITOR HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. WHOSE PLACE HAVE YOU TRIED TO MAKE YOUR OWN THESE DAYS? I CAN'T DO NOTHING BUT RUN. NOBODY'S PLACE, DAD. YOU KNOW THAT. CAN WE TALK A MINUTE? I NEED HELP, DAD. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE DEMONS INSIDE OF ME... INSIDE MY HEART... TEARING APART MY SOUL. THE DEMONS IN YOUR SOUL. LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. CAN YOU TELL ME THE... THE NAMES OF THE VACANT SPIRITS KNOCKING ON MY DOORS? CAN YOU FEEL THE... THE EMPTY HALLWAYS? STREETS?! SOMETIMES THEY SAY FATHER KNOWS BEST, BUT IN THIS CASE, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT! WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES, DAD. WE HAD SOME FUCKING REAL GOOD TIMES. NOW YOUR VOICE IS TREMBLING. IT'S SHAKING, MY UNKNOWN VISITOR, AND I KNOW BETTER. AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NO ANSWER. YET NOBODY CAN COME UP WITH ONE GOOD REASON... WHY I SHOULDN'T BLOW MY HEAD OFF! TELL ME, SON. WHERE IS GOD?! HE'S WITHIN ME, TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK. I WANT MY BOY BACK, AND I WANT HIM NOW! WHO LEAVES A BOY 4 YEARS OLD WITH A BROTHER ONLY 3 YEARS OLDER THAN HIM?! I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT, DAD?! WHO DOES THAT?! WHY DON'T YOU SEE ME, DAD? PLEASE! REMEMBER ME! YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A DREAMER. YOU NEVER WILL BE YOU. I NEVER WILL BE ME. RUN AWAY, CHASE. JUST KEEP RUNNING. AND YOU'LL GET THERE. YOU'LL GET THERE. YOU'LL FIND YOUR HOME. WILL YOU EVER LOVE ME AGAIN? I'LL ALWAYS LIVE IN VINEYARDS WHERE WILD CHILDREN STEAL EVERYTHING. WHERE ARE YOU?! I'M RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. REALLY... IT DOESN'T... MATTER. WHY DOESN'T IT MATTER? BECAUSE... BECAUSE? IT WON'T EVER BE THE SAME. AND GOD LOOKED DOWN UPON PARADISE LOST, AND HE SAID, "CAIN..." YES, GOD? AAH! NO! HELP ME! HELP ME! HELP ME! HELP ME! YOU GOT TO HELP ME! YOU GOT TO HELP ME! I NEED HELP! HELP ME! HELP ME! PLEASE HELP ME! HE-E-LP! HELP ME! HELP ME! NO! NO! NO! YOU WANT TO... KNOW THE TRUTH? NO! OH, GOD! NO! I... AAH! AAH! I KNOW! I KNOW, I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW!! AAH! AAH! I KNOW! I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. Chase: I WON. DID NOT. I ALWAYS WIN. WHY IS MY NAME CHARLIE? I TOLD MOM AND DAD TO NAME YOU THAT. YOU DID? YEP. I GAVE IT TO YOU SO YOU WOULD BE A SOLDIER LIKE GRANDPA. GRANDPA WAS A SOLDIER FOR REALS? YEP. DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO BE A SOLDIER? YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE. YOU WANT TO BE A SOLDIER WITH ME? I WANT TO BE A WRITER. I'M GONNA BE THE BEST SOLDIER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. I'M GONNA BE THE BEST WRITER. CROSS YOUR HEART. HOPE TO DIE. Charlie: COME ON. YOU PROMISED. COME ON, CHASE. COME ON. YOU PROMISED ME. I'M TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOU. COME ON, CHASE. COME ON. I'M SICK OF WAITING FOR YOU. I'M TIRED. YOU PROMISED ME. COME ON, CHASE.
