"Smoking causes cancer. Smoking Kills." "Consumption of alcohol is injurious to health." "Be safe. Don't drink and drive." What are you thinking, Aarthi? Do you behave like the police? Don't you feel ashamed? You've let down the whole department. There is respect for this uniform. If they hear your father's name, not just criminals, even our department was scared. Sorry, uncle. - No uncle. Only sir. Sorry, sir. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Don't you have anything else to say? Her suspension order, sir. - Yeah. What happened? - She made my cap drop, sir. Not me, sir. Where is the pen? It'll be here only, uncle. Sir. Aarthi, what is this? Your attitude is not right. - Gosh! I don't have a clue, how it was there, sir. You can leave. - Yes, sir. When your father was training us, you were just a child. You had a pacifier in your mouth. I used to carry you. As you were motherless, your father... - See here. When you became a police... he gave me your appointment order. Hey! - Huh? What happened? - Nothing, uncle. You won't believe it, even if I tell you. What? Your ghost story, is it? Non-sense. Don't you have any ambition? I do have, uncle. I want to sit in your seat. Fine, come and sit down. - No, uncle. I want to become a commissioner and sit in that seat. That is my ambition. For your attitude, you are not even fit to be a constable. Here is your suspension order. Come, take it. Do your best and prove yourself. Please, uncle, I am really... - No more uncle. Sir! Sir. Long-nosed? Gosh, uncle. I did not write this. I will erase it with my saliva. - Get out. I am sorry... - Out! Do you want an auto? Where do you want to go, madam? - Go to T-Nagar. Why this, madam? Hey! - She is awake, brother. Oo! Tell me properly. Where are those three? Tell before Dass gets here. Brother, did you add salt? Slightly. - Hmm. Hey! It feels cold to get spit on by your lipstick lips. I don't have any problem. But how do I look? Do you know the consequence of going against me? Bald! Bald fellow! - Hey. Bald fellow! What are you doing? Where are those three? Tell me. - Bald fellow, stop it now. Babu, are you still thinking about what those kids said? Hey, then, should I forget about it? Yesterday, I watched a English movie, dubbed in Tamil. None of them had proper lip sync. Fool, do you sound like a future director? Then? - He also has a long face. What's wrong now? You are frowning on a good day. You tell me. I narrated a story to that producer. He wants me to make a short film, with my own money. Also, he is showing someone as the heroine. Instead, you could act like a female. Yes, I could. - Who can watch that? Hmm. - That is quite impossible. Let's go back to burglary itself. Hey, what has Socrates said? He has said never to step back. What if there's a nail in the front? - Wear slippers. Listen to me. Rather than listening to his advice, you can make a film with that heroine. Hey, is she even worth the effort? Let me describe the heroine of our film. If we keep the frame for the intro... Damn, what kind of face is this? Did you call me? Gosh, get lost. Gosh. - Who can bear such a face? Who are you messing with? - The heroine of our film, if we set the frame, will make a beautiful entry. Wow! "There is one beauty out of all Bramman's creations. It's her." "If I see her, my heart burns like cotton. Don't know the reason." "There is one beauty out of all Bramman's creations. It's her." "If I see her, my heart burns like cotton. Don't know the reason." "She is like a glass cake. If she looks at me, I get a shock." "She is a fifty-kilogram cake, filtered out from heaven." "She talks sweetly. Even her anger is pretty." "I don't want anyone else. She is all I need." "If I see you, I become a zero. Can you come as my heroine?" "If I see you, I become a zero. Can you come as my heroine?" "If I see you, I become a zero. Can you come as my heroine?" "If I see you, I become a zero. Can you come as my heroine?" 'Didn't I teach him the moves yesterday night?' 'Huh? 'Hey, wait. What kind of move is this? Hmm... Hmm... - Get lost. "Beautiful arrogance. She is like a statue. An angel without any wings." "Her laughter broke all our hearts. Touched our lives. Wanning gibbous." "Did they make you out of milk? Did they bleach you to be this fair?" "Did they dip you in gold powder and make you out of gold?" "I don't want anyone." - Good shot. Crazy girl. "You are all I need." - Hey! "My scene will be a scene." - Hmm. Rolling, action. "If I see you, I become a zero." "Can you come as my heroine?" "If I see you, I become a zero." "Can you come as my heroine?" - Take your legs. Sorry, baby. Excuse me. - Yes. Shall I ask you... You are the heroine of my film. Not my life. Don't try to hit on me. Ready! What? Oh, sorry, dear. I know I was greedy. No. Don't lose it. Don't. Thanks for the Oscar award. All praise the lord. "If I see you, I become a zero." "Can you come as my heroine?" Who are you, madam? You look very pretty. Why are you roaming around alone at night? These are the questions, I should be asking. Do we look that pretty? Who are you all? - We are Maniratnam's assistants. Hmm. - Oh! Are you working in Maniratnam's house garden? Madam. We are Maniratnam's assistant's assistant's assistant's last assistant. We are also directors, in a way. We were searching for a pretty heroine for our movie. You made a beautiful entry when I set the frame. That is why I like you so much. - Madam. If you tell us your station, we will come and ask for your hand. What? - Spelling mistake, madam. I meant, ask for your call sheet, madam. If you give me dates for my movie, you can top Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and all languages. In addition, in Hindi, we can keep a cutout for you, as Kajal Aggarwal. What say? Do you know who I am? You must be working on some station for fifty thousand rupees. Then, if you take bribes, another fifty thousand. So, in total, one lakh rupees per month. But, if you agree to act in our movie, I can get you a salary of one crore rupees. But, one condition. You need to act in my short film, for two hundred. I want to hit and break your face. If I had the Police jeep, I would've taken all of you. Even now, no issues, madam. You can take us with you. I will narrate the story when we ride triples. Okay, madam? Madam, can I take one selfie? Hey, I am going to film a whole movie with her. When? Where? What's there for a selfie? Take it. How did you know? Ready boss. Smile. Okay. - Nice one. Good. Should I pay you, madam? - Hey, stupid. Clear the way. - Why? Madam, why are you leaving? - Madam. Hey! She is the heroine of our movie. - Confirm. Nancy. Did you see it? I've invented a special medicine for you. If only you drink this, your lifestyle itself will change. Come, come, my sweetheart. Drink it, yes. Very good. Then, you darling. Come. That's like it. Nancy, don't run. Don't run. Nancy! Hey! - Nancy darling. This should be the last burglary in my life. Did you run away like Maggie too? - We should not do any more. Sweetheart, Nancy! - What is he searching for? Let me pull this and leave. - Damn. Who are you? - Sir. This is 'sound' Saroja's house. There is a red light glowing, without any sound, right? Yes. That is the 'sound' Saroja's house. She just came by car. Oh, they're back. - What do we do now? Then let's go to the next house. Change of plan. Come, let's go. Fine. Nancy. Hmm. Listen, there will be a lot of expense for our short film. Let's meet all the expenses, from here. Action. The first shot will be the cupboard. To make a film, we just need the CD and not the brain. How can you make a movie, then? - Let's move. Do you know what this is? - Hello. Why question? Just put it in. Don't even bother to ask. Next shot. Laptop. - Why is it here? Keep the next shot here. This is for the music director. Director, why have they filled in the bulbs with coloured water? All the original scientists have died. Don't touch it. Not worth a penny. Now, one person will open the door and ask who you are. Who are you? You enquired me for an address and now inside my home now. Hey, a doll with a key. Sit here and save your respect. Hmm. Good. - Babu, start the narration. What will be the total value? Not much, maybe fifty thousand. We should sell him also, for that amount. Hey! - Listen here. Just fifty thousand total. If I hit you, you will bleed out of your head and end up in a coma. If you are in a coma, the hospital expense would be five lakhs. Your right brain will ask you to shout for help. But, your left brain... - Will say no. Your right brain will become your subconscious mind and make you think. - Don't think. So? You will come to steal from my house. Should I just watch you? - Hey! If you want, we can add your name, in the credits, thanking you. Or, we will put you in the end credits. Police! Isn't that the title of my next movie? -Hey. He is calling the police. - Oh! Show him that. - Brother. Even the police are our friends. Do you see? - Oh my god. We just hugged her and came. - Hey! Sorry, we gave her a share and came. Listen, I'll return everything after my movie is complete, don't worry. Hey! - What? Did you see this? Temple's Hundial. Take it. Let's see its worth. - Hey! No, no. Don't take it. Damn! - Twist it and see. Listen to me. Please, don't open it. Brother, let's see what it is. - No, stop it. Thank God. They did not try to sniff it. Oh, yes. - Oh, yes. No! Where are you? Come soon. How long since I asked you to come? Does it take this long, to come by jeep? Sorry, Aarthi. My vehicle wouldn't start. So, I took the load vehicle and came. Hey, what kind of dress is this? That... I was in the midst of an important work. Since you wanted me urgently, I just came like this. Like this? You are wearing a ladies skirt. Skirt? I thought it was my dhoti. That's why she shouted at me when I was leaving. Where is Aadhi? The first call I made was to Aadhi. He is not here yet. Aadhi... - Here. I have come. Oh God! What is the matter? Why did you call? What, Aadhi? You've come like this. Do you look like the police? Listen, you urged me to come soon. In your hurry, though, I was making 'dosa' I didn't eat it. See, I am wearing my cap. I am the police. How stupid? You don't have any sense. Fine, okay. Why did you call us? Tell that. Dass has escaped. Has Dass escaped? - Has Dass escaped? Fine. But, who is that, Dass? - Huh? He was the accused, arrested by my father, twenty years back. But why are we here for that? Informer told me that, he is in hiding here. You should've called Kathamuthu, then. Because, he is this area's inspector. No need. He was accused and arrested by my father. I will only arrest him. Follow me. - Oh, the family accused. We should only catch him. - Come. Aarthi! - What? What will be the age of that Dass? He will be 60 plus. Then, he'll surely not be upstairs. Because I eat at home. I can't climb up. How could he, when he has had jail food? Correct. So, he could be hiding somewhere on the ground floor. Come, let's search here. Is Dass such a heinous criminal? In the past, he had the whole city in his palms. And many were trying to arrest him. But only my father could. He had weapons imported from Bombay and killed many people. The public used to be scared, just by hearing his name. Even the goons will runoff from him. My father formed a separate team to arrest him. He made a master plan and had him arrested. I have worked on this station for many years, how could I not know this criminal? When were you ever in the station? You would be on leave most days. Hmm. - Okay, okay. If I don't arrest Dass, I am not Aarthi. Those rabbits, are trying to hunt down this lion. Quite, He might hear us. Don't poke your nose, he might spit on it. Yuck. What happened? Does he have a weapon? No, he is standing without any guilt. Gosh. We should arrest him, for sure. You go that side. Aadhi, you take this side. Okay. But why? To catch Dass. Me? I haven't even got anyone. Should I catch Dass? Dass! Dass. Dass. - Damn. What is this? - Dass. You are running in nighty. Are you going to rape anyone? - Damn. I mean, is someone trying to rape you? No, no. PC Aadhilakshmi. - Oh! Are you PC? - Can't talk. Please, sit down. - Thank God. Can I have this water? - Yes, sure you can. That Dass... - Dass? There is an accused called Dass. He had escaped from jail. Who can catch him? Does she listen to me? She is adamant that only she will catch him. That is not possible. It will be good if she listens to me. She is making a mistake. You resign. - Hey, Idiot. He is Dass. - What is she saying? Because I ran for so long, I can't hear properly. Can't you hear her? - Not at all. She is telling you that I am Dass. Are you Dass? - Yes. Is it so? - Hey, catch her. Are you Dass? - You are chatting with him. Yes? - Yes. Hey, wait. Stop there. I will burn you with this. Do you think, you can catch me in nighty? I will hit you. First, wear your uniform. Hey, no. Wait, my Mayil will come and catch you. "Cuckoo cuckoo. Enjoy enjami." - Is he Dass? Who are you? Did you come with Aadhi? - Yes. Didn't you get a nighty? - No, I just got a skirt. Fine. Her BP shot up, and she is struggling. Oh, damn! I'll bring an auto. - Okay. You call an ambulance, just in case. - Ambulance? Ambulance. Come soon to the winding mill. Oh, no. Hey, Dass. Stop. I'll shoot you. - "Enjoy Enjami." "Come in front of me." - Hey, don't run. Aadhi, Mayil! Come soon. Damn, Dass is escaping in a car. Stop! Sir! An accused is escaping in that car. Follow him. Quick! Hey, Dass! Sir, go faster. Come on. Shit. Faster, a little more. Damn, he is escaping. Quick. Hey! Uncle, is it you? Aarthi, is that you? I thought it was her husband and went in circles out of fear. What are you doing here? She is a nurse working with me. She wanted to hang out. So, I took her and went around... Then, where is Dass? - Dass? Is your husband's name Dass? - No. It's not her husband. - Why are you here, dear? Inspector baby. It was me, who gave you a lift, baby. Hey, Dass. A star, living star, baby. - No. No, Dass. Stop. Dass! Dass! Hey! Poor fellow. Finally, we have to take you in the ambulance you asked for. Hello! - Are you alive? What happened? Did he die? - Hey, Dass. Damn. The auspicious time is about to be over. Where is the bride? Is the wedding dress, in khaki colour now? Come, wear the garland. 'Iyer', start with the rituals. I am a doctor. Why shouldn't a doctor do the rituals? Wow, aunty. Today is our first night, right? Hello, brother-in-law. Yes, brother-in-law. I did not notice you. Tell you something. Go and decorate first night bedroom, with roses. Why is he blabbering like this? Do something. I am a mortuary doctor. I can do something, only in the mortuary. He is talking differently. He should be treated elsewhere. 'Government Mental Institute, Chennai.' Hey! What noise is that? Hey! - "Du, du." Hey. I will break your hips. Why are you dancing in the centre of the corridor? "Du, du." I will hit you. Silence. Devi, I love you. I love you, too. Hey! Baldy is coming. Run. Baldy is coming. Baldy is coming. Run, run. - Greetings, brother. Go inside. - Don't hit us. Baldy is coming. Run. Get lost. - Baldy. Baldy is coming. Run. Hey! Brother. There is a new case in room twelve. Take him to Dr Sheela for admission. - Okay. In-room thirteen the inspector has come to enquire about Dass's case. Take her to our Dr Visu. - Okay. Baldy. - Yes. Twelve is the case, thirteen is Dass. Fine. - Don't interchange. Hello, Mayil. - Aarthi. Hello. Mayil, can you hear me? As usual, no proper signal. - Hello. Aarthi. Hello. - Talk louder, Aarthi. Mayil. - Can you hear? Hello. - I can't understand anything. I am at a mental hospital to enquire about Dass. I can't hear. Hello. Can you hear? - No. Can you hear? Ah... Excuse me. - Excuse me. Hello, Mayil. Hello. - Excuse me. Mayil, can you hear? - Excuse me. Mayil. Hello. Hello. It's been a long since I saw you. Such a cutie fellow, cutie. Ting, ting. Greetings, madam. Hmm. I'll complete a small work and get back, madam. Excuse me. - Madam. In five minutes, I'll take you to Dass, madam. Yes. Hey! Why are you sitting so casually? Come out. How can you talk to me like that? Hey, I am an inspector. - Oh! Are you roaming around with such an imagination? Come out. - Hey! Excuse me. She is mentally unstable, madam. Hmm, hmm. - Ah. Leave me. Leave my hand, you baldy. - Come. Baldy, listen to me. - Gosh, come. I've seen so many like you. - Do you know who I am? The new case, is it, brother? I am the inspector. Someone had hit baldy. - Someone had hit baldy. Someone had hit baldy. Someone had hit baldy. He is already baldy, right? They hit him in the bald head itself. Is it? Someone had hit baldy. - Greetings, sir. Who? What the hell! - Come. No. Get in. - Baldy. Baldy! What are you doing? I am an inspector. Open this. Hey! Action! Ah... ah... - Hey! One more. 'We are all Maniratnam's assistants.' 'Vaiya vaiya vaiyaa.' - Yes, cover. Hey! - Okay. Take okay? What are you doing here? Are you all mental? Hey, who are you? Why did you come inside the shooting spot? What is the manager doing? - Director. Focus carefully. This is... our heroine. Huh? Somebody open the door. I know very well. - Baldy. That, you will come to my office. You have. You should leave only after finishing my movie. If only you act in my movie, I will put your title card, with a lot of build-ups. Director! First, tell our movie's title. "Ghosty." Ghosty. Ghosty. Ghosty. The name of the movie is Ghosty, it seems. 'Ghosty.' 'Ghosty.' 'Ghosty.' 'Ghosty.' 'Ghosty.' Let's take Kajal Agarwal to the caravan. Hey, put a sofa on four wheeler and make our heroine sit in that. Okay, director. - Okay. I need to get prepared for the shot. - Baldy! Why are you acting there? - Don't call baldy. Don't touch me. - Come here. Hey! - Careful. The pants might tear off. She is in the van. Listen. I am telling from the director's point of view. Everybody is hungry. If you get up, they'll bite you as you look like chocolate. The first bite will be mine. Yes. His mouth is more poisonous than a monkey's. Careful. Hey, monkey! Give juice to heroine. If she is adamant, give one in the face. Get her the juice. Director. - Yes. There is even beer in the fridge. That's for us to share, after the pack up. Okay? Won't you drink? Hey. Take it. - Drink. Have this juice. - Hmm. Police. Madam, is it you? Madam, there was a scientist's house. We opened a flask there. All three of us sniffed that. That got in our brains. After that... Hey, lights on. How long will you take a break? Where are you? What kind of costume is this? Like a horse rider. They gave us only this. What about her? Who is that customer? Do you know the dance master? We should tie the heroine and hang her upside down. Where is that fight master? Look here, there are no properties for the war. Where is that stupid art director? The wig suits you well. Ah.. How can you hit the co-director? The editor cut off the shot. Hey, cameraman! Keep a tight close-up of that heroine. This is a tight and weight shot. Yes, that's it. Now comes the music. It has to be super. I cannot give the pay, you are demanding. We are paying the interest, even during corona. Display the name of the one, who said this. Nobody knows about it. She isn't answering the phone, too. The doctor is here. Let's ask her. Excuse me, doctor. Did you see Inspector Aarthi, who was here? Excuse me. No, Aarthi is the inspector... Excuse me. No, inspector Aarthi... - Aarthi... Excuse me... Mayil... - Understood. Leave. - Excuse me. Thank you. - Excuse me. Thank you. - Excuse me. She is also a case, we thought of her as a doctor. Isn't this a spiritual movie? Give a prop in her hands for that. Doctor, open the door. Maybe she has left for the office. Shouldn't she inform? Yes. - About her whereabouts. Aarthi! - Where were you? Why are you playing with them? - Gosh. Excuse me. Is it a mechanic shed or mental hospital? Guess she is the mental case. But, that baldy locked me inside. Oh! Who is that baldy? - Baldy. I am coming, madam. Baldy. Damn, baldy. Lock the door. Hide here. Come on. What is this bad smell inside the caravan? Who used this as the restroom? - Huh? Yuck! Baldy! Come soon. Come, come. - Yes. Patients are roaming outside. Excuse me. - Huh? Irresponsible fellow, you have locked the inspector inside. Open. I will open it now. - Open. Quick, open. - Are you playing with us? Stupid fellow. Where is Dass? Come, madam. I'll take you. Sister, madam. We forgot an important thing, madam. What is it? We forgot to mention the director's name. Make it quick. 'Written and Directed by Kalyaan.' "When the breeze caresses," "how will our heart feel?" "It's coming and going," - I will take care of you later. "my heart feels colourful." Dass! Come, my dear wifey. What took you so long to bring my morning tea? Tea? Well, did our kids start to school... Hey, why are you still watching TV? If you have had breakfast, start now. Have you kept hot water, for me to shower? Welcome, aunty. When did you come? Just now, dear son-in-law. You've put on some weight, I suppose. It is because I worry about you. Wow, how caring! - Aadhi! You keep talking. I will take a shower and be back. What are you doing? Is he your son-in-law? Be a Roman when you are in Rome. - Damn. This is out of the planet. You will also go crazy. - I am not... Dry your hair well, son-in-law. Here, dry the towel. Wow, brother-in-law! When did you come? How are you? - I am doing good. Fine. You were worried about the police job. Did you get it? If not, inform me. I will recommend you. What is your opinion on this? Can you shut up? Wifey, I need to leave for the office. Bring my bag. Here it is. Are you trying to help your daughter? So, your daughter is angry with me? Right? Little. Just a little bit angry. I need to convince her. So, let me kiss her. You can turn to the other side. Stupid. - What? Are you pretending? Don't you know who I am? I know. Aarthi. Inspector of police. So, you are pretending. Did you only find that now? Who gave you the police job? Her father, Veerapandian, IPS. - Her father, Veerapandian, IPS. Oh! Oh ho. Are you Veerapandian's daughter? Maybe. But, you are my wife. So, I am going to kiss and convince her. You both turn away, please. Yuck. - Oh, my Lord! Aarthi, don't hit him. - Damn, gosh. He is a patient by law. - Aarthi, don't hit him. Listen to me. He is fooling with us. - Aarthi, don't. Damn, gosh. - Aarthi, please be patient. No, stop it. - Listen to us, Aarthi. How dare you slap me? - No, stop. Will you listen to me? - You! No, this is a hospital. - I won't leave him. Stop it. Don't do this in the hospital. I can't let him be. Leave him, Aarthi. - Damn, no. Stop, stop. - How could she behave this worst? No, Aarthi. - You will regret it in the future. What is this, Aarthi? How can you hit a patient, who is mentally affected? Ma'am, he is just pretending. What are you saying, Aarthi? The doctor has certified that he is mentally affected. You should not misuse your power, like this. Why are you standing still, Aarthi? Talk something. Will you do anything, just because you are in uniform? Do you have any respect for human life? 'Tell us.' Tell us. - 'Fish.' You cannot come here. Leave now. - 'Fish.' Let me in. Tell her to leave. I will take care, sir. - Let me in. 'What will you do now, Aarthi?' 'I will prepare the fish curry.' 'Keep the pot on the stove' 'and add fenugreek, onion, tomato, and green chilli. Sauté well.' 'Add the fish, and once it boils,' 'switch off, after adding tea powder.' Tea powder? 'It's only optional.' 'Recipe is ready.' Hmm. Hello. - Aarthi darling. Is the fish curry ready? We are on our way. Super flavourful fish curry is ready. I can smell it, even through the phone. That's an exaggeration. Come. Let us add and see the tea powder. Hands up. - Huh? Who is it? Dass. Periyappa Dass. Call your father. - Why? Hmm? For twenty years, he spoiled the total youth of my life. He is a sinner. I need to shoot him. Don't you understand? You are just a kid. Then, you were having a pacifier in your mouth. I was just a normal gangster. He took me to the police station, talking about compromise. He charged me with ten fake cases, and locked me in for twenty years. Not just him. The five inspectors who helped him. I will kill them, one by one too. First is your father. Call your father. - Dad. He is calling you. Is he near me? Hey, come on. Hands up. He has passed away. Has he retired from his life, too? Ha ha. You are lucky to die soon. You did not die in my hands. But there are those five inspectors. I will not leave them. As long as I am alive, you cannot do anything, Dass. Can I not? - Hmm. Then, you can die. Do you have a conscience? Keep couple more pieces. - Eat well. 'This is good.' 'Brother, keep that.' 'Brother, this will shoot more precisely.' 'And, it can also roll well like this.' 'Rolling is fine.' 'Will it shoot properly?' 'It made only the sound.' 'I will take care of you later.' Puff... puff... How could you add tea powder to fish curry? You will eat even when shampoo is added. Aren't you ashamed? Yuck. - Aren't you ashamed? You showed your bravery to a girl with a fake gun. What to do about that? Next time, I will get a good gun, from a good place. To test that, I will shoot the guy who sold me this fake gun. - Hey! Won't you ever change? Take note. Just in ten days, I will kill those five people, who helped his father. It will be my encounter. - What if you can't? If I can't, on the eleventh day, I will come and surrender to you. I am Dass, who has dignity and pride. Wow, awesome! - Thank you. She has kept a super fish curry, Mayil. Awesome, dear. - Thank you. Aarthi, super. 'She is making fun of me.' Poor guy. Guess he is starving. Let us give him a good fish curry meal and then take care of him. - Correct. Hey, I don't need all that. - What he says is correct. He might change because of your cooking skills. Mayil, free his hands. - Okay. You are a very good person. - What are you doing? Mayil, he has escaped from a mental hospital. This is risky. He is above sixty. He can't escape. No, stop. - I am here, right? Even before hanging, they ask for the last wish. Hey, free the right hand. Aadhi, I don't think this is right. - Leave it. He will escape. Stop. - He won't. Aadhi, No. - One minute. Remove it. Good. - Aadhi. What fish is that? Smells like an eel. Can you stand comfortably? Here, take it. - Oh damn. I am sixty-plus, only by looks. But with an energy of a twenty-plus. Come. Hey! Damn, no. - Will you repeat this? You are hitting me badly. No, leave me. - Will you sing to me? What are you doing? It's ticklish. Ha ha. - Is it ticklish? Damn, leave it. - No. You are done. Ah... Ah... - I am Veerapandi's daughter. Aunty, do you have ginger? - Gosh. It's too tight. Leave me. Ginger, dry ginger, long pepper, everything is inside. Take it. Hey! - Hey. No. Damn. - Hold my hands. How can you catch me with the same hands that make curry? My stupid aunty... Aarthi, don't leave him. Catch. No lock-up for him. Only encounter. - Catch. I will come behind you. Run faster. - Aarthi, don't leave him. Hey, stop. - Stop. "Ancestral's land was given. Cuckoo... Cuckoo..." Hey! Dass. Stop, or I will shoot you. - Just shoot him. Good. Chapter closed, come. You have shot him. Mayil, check if he is alive. Oh damn. What are you saying? Is he alive? No, Aadhi. - Damn. Fine, I am coming. If you have a gun in your hands, will you shoot anyone? Won't you shoot carefully? Without seeing the person, you have shot someone else. All because of that, Dass. Gosh. I was also not thinking... - Hey! Inform before you horn. I have escaped all these years. But today, I don't think I can. Darling. - Naughty. Eat well. Ah... Uncle! - What? Ah... I was checking for salt. That's it. I shot someone. What is this? Your dad was a big encounter specialist. Why are you sad about shooting someone? You should be proud, that you shot someone. No, uncle. I shot the wrong person. The wrong person did wrong things. So, you shot. Isn't your shooting correct, then? She thought it was the right person and shot the wrong one. - You are confusing. She shot someone else. Leave it. Always police used to shoot one instead of the other. There are ten cases like that, already inside. Fine. What is that person saying? He did not open his mouth till last. Very good, then. When he is silent, why do you get tensed? Damn, uncle. He has died. - What? Did he die? - Yes. 'Why was I shocked by this?' Fine. Drop the body here. I will remove the bullet and keep it in the freezer. Mayil, what are you sniffing around? Do you want to eat a palm of this? Biryani? Guess you are feeling shy. Fine. Where is the body? Don't you worry. We will burn all unclaimed bodies in three days. We will add him to that. Don't be in a hurry. Till I get some information about him, hold the body here. One important thing. No one should know about this. Gosh, how will I tell anyone, uncle? If anyone knows, I can even lose my job. Damn, not that, dear. Don't tell your aunty that, I was feeding the nurse. - Gosh. What is this? How can you romance here? Stupid fellow. - Get lost. Oh, is it from outside? There are those five inspectors, right, I will kill them with my own hands. Hello, uncle. - What? Aarthi at this time? Dass has escaped from jail. He said he would kill you all. 'Ha ha ha.' Why are you all laughing? - What else should we do? There is nothing to fear about Dass. Dass is an ordinary local accused. We need not be scared of him. We will not be in any trouble. You be careful. Uncle, I am very serious. When we arrested Dass, you were with a pacifier in your mouth. We don't have to be scared of him. He is like a Chandramuki snake. You keep the phone down. The match is about to start. Don't disturb me. Hmm. 'That’s right. Boult was indeed gone.' What is this? Yeah, looks good. 'And, another one.' 'And, another one. He is to the ball...' Wow, Very good! Hey, move aside. What is this, brother? Move aside. He is watching TV without any fear. Let me watch the match. Move aside. Hello, Dass brother is here. Let it be. Move aside. He is here to kill you. Gosh, let's see that all later. First, let me watch the match. Move aside. - Kill him right now, brother. He should not die immediately. Then, how will he know my feelings? Hey! Do you recognise me? Do you remember what happened twenty years ago? What match! - You were an ordinary inspector and were lean. It happened then. How can you remember that? Now, you've become fat after eating like a pig. You would've forgotten. On my wedding day, you promised public forgiveness. You took me with that promise but charged me with fake cases. It got me arrested and made me suffer for many years. Wow, great! Are you clapping? I was doing the same in prison, but to kill mosquitoes. Hey, I was sleeping amidst the bed bugs for all these years. I even cleaned the toilets. I wore the same coloured jail uniform. All that was okay. Do you know how big of an accused I am? But I had to scratch my back with my own hand. Hey, I will always keep my word. I wanted to kill all six of you. And I'm here to fulfil that. Hey! Move away, blood might scatter. 'Wow!' Four, four. - Awesome. Hey! What is this? You are all watching the TV. Brother, be silent. The match is exciting. Hello, we are here to kill. Damn, will anyone take revenge, for making you scratch your back? Look at that six! Wow! - Great! Who is that? He looks new. He is batting well, too. - Dhoni, brother. Dhoni? - Yes. When I went to prison, Gavaskar was only playing. 'Gonna get him. Taken. Wow, direct hit.' 'Oh, he has got a wicket. I could see' 'patience. But, in the end' 'simply couldn't resist.' 'Is it that magic three-letter word?' 'And that's a ball in stump...' Hey, this is an old match. What, is your Dhoni gone? Brother, he is also gone. Gosh! 'And in the end...' What is this? Then, why did I come here? Completed easily. Come, brother, let's leave. How can you say so? But still, I don't feel satisfied. Let me stab him a few times. - Damn. What is this? Did you bring us to hit a dead snake? What will happen to our dignity? Come, let's leave. - This is bad. Let's leave them. - This is not working. I had to struggle to make them believe that I am a gangster, brother. Don't spoil my name by stabbing a dead body. Let's leave, brother. He escaped. But, we shouldn't leave the next. Kill him cruelly. Sure. - Sure. Come, brother. As Dhoni was run out, six people committed suicide. Don't murmur. Read it aloud. We should also hear. A van overturned in a pit. Three were killed. Is that important? Check if there's anything about our news. Nothing has come like that. - What happened, madam? My son is missing. Is the inspector available? Yes. Madam! Oh God, madam. Sit down. Don't be tense. What happened? Sit down. Don't be scared. Do you want water? It's okay. I don't need it. Tell me. My son has been missing since yesterday night, madam. He will always take a walk in the woods. But he hasn't returned yet. Tell your son's name and age details, madam. My son's name is Robert. He is of marriage age. Can you tell me some other identification? He was wearing a red shirt, when he went out last. My son is my everything. I will be orphaned if he is not there. Do you have a photo of your son? I brought it with me. He will look like a prince. Damn... Gosh. Is it him? - Huh. Where is he? How is he? Sorry, madam. I did it... - Aarthi! Can you be quiet? Look at this photo. Damn! Do you know how pretty would he look smiling? Our Robbert, right? Robbert. If he goes for a shoot, he will earn two thousand per day. Shankar is making a film in the moon, right? He is the main lead in that movie. Shh... - If my son calls me mom. Do you know how touching it would be? What is that sound? - Madam. Robbert! My son is back, madam. Robbert! Where did you take him? Didn't I tell you last night? I was taking Robbert for exercise. Did you forget? Oh, yes. Yesterday, I had and slept. - What? Tablet, madam. - Oh. Can you come? Let's take a selfie. - What the hell? Come. - Madam, you can leave. Hey, Robbert. Say bye to aunty. - Who is calling me aunty? This dog? - Aunty. Leave, madam. Take him with you. Bye, madam. - Huh... Look at these cases. - Madam. Did you see anyone wearing a red shirt? Again red shirt, is it? Hello, is this how you give a complaint? Shall I give you a written one, sir? Shall I give you one on the left? Get lost. It's irritating to hear the red shirt. Mayil, come here. Let's have tea. Madam. Sadasivam uncle has passed away. What? Oh, dear, you have left me alone. Aarthi dear, how can you console me? Look at your uncle. He doesn't look like himself. When I left out, I asked him not to watch the match. As he sees several times, can Dhoni, at least not get run out? He got out and made my husband die. This cricket is crazy... Ouch. Damn. What is this? The Icebox is giving a shock. I cannot even touch my husband and cry. What, dear? Did you also get a shock? What will I do without him? Aadhi, I feel very tired. I will go inside and rest. Call me if the commissioner comes. Aadhi, can you touch and see. - Don't worry. His death came as a shock for me too. Got a shock. 'Silence everywhere.' What is happening outside and what are you doing here? Huh? TV, is it? Sister, shouldn't we even watch TV? Is this a dress for a funeral? Go change. - Get lost, sister. Go. He was so good, and this happened. Hello. Hey, Aarthi. Did you see how I killed your uncle? Shameless. He died of a heart attack. What, brother? Is she scared? Of course. She was out of words, in fear. Commissioner, sir. Did you come to get his blessings? Look at my husband's face, sir. Try touching the ice box, sir. Did you also get shocked? - Everybody is getting shocked. Is this real? Damn, everybody is getting shocked at my husband. Aarthi, the commissioner, is here. Come. Sir. Silly girl. I asked you to console me, but look at you. What is this, Aarthi? Uncle got a heart attack. Damn. Don't feel bad, uncle. What can you do? What is this? Is this how you come to a funeral? Commissioner sir. She has changed a funeral into a circus, sir. Meet me at the office tomorrow morning. Uncle! Uncle, I am sorry. Aarthi is standing like this. Damn! Who did this? Yeah. Huh. Madam, I need to see the commissioner. Can you take care of this file? - Okay. I will be back. - Leave it there. It's an important file, madam. Then, leave it here. Madam. It's a very important file. Take care. Please. Excuse me, madam. That file... - You! If you want, take it with you. - No, later. Huh? Madam! What have you done? What did I do? It is an important file, madam. How can you do origami with it? I've to hand it over to commissioner, madam. What is this, madam? - Paper. How it happened, I don't understand, too. - What, madam? Aarthi, come in. Excuse me. Uncle. - In uncle's death ceremony, how can you do such a make up? Don't you have common sense? Not like that, uncle. - Hey, cool. Why are you crying? What happened there? No, uncle. I scolded the kids over there. Guess they got to me for it while I was sleeping. What? How can you sleep there? Sir. Look at what she has done to the file, sir. I asked her to take care, as its an important file, and I was going to the restroom. She had made it a mess, sir. What is this, Aarthi? Get out. Hey, leave me. Why are you hitting me for a hike in petrol rates? What, Mani? She looks new. She was roaming like crazy, on the streets for two days. Social workers brought her here and left. Dad. - Don't talk. Stay silent. Stay quiet. Silence. - Dad. Go. Get inside. This is some burnt doll. Throw it away and carry on. Hey, don't be in a hurry. Can't you see its eyes? It looks like a sorcery doll. Who will do sorcery on her? Balanandha. - Balanandha? How many times have I asked you not to arrest him? He even said before going to jail that, you will regret. Hey. Go, bring him here. There are four-five cases of him. I will bring him as enquiry for one of them. 'How can I escape from him?' Come. Welcome, 'Swamy'. Come. Greetings. Welcome. - Welcome. Come inside. - Why are you stopping, 'Swamy'? I was in penance on one leg for the past three days. Got slipped. Oh. - Nothing like that. He has tried to escape from jail. They have hit him in the leg and left him like this. Then, I will return to jail. - 'Damn.' 'Swamy', come. - 'Swamy', come. 'Swamy', come. - I will come for you. I can't find out the fancy store he bought it from. What is it, 'Swamy'? I said, I cannot recognise the disciple who did this. Well, you locked me in for a fake case. Now, how can you take me out? - 'Swamy'. I warned them many times. Not to lock you in, as you are a very powerful person. But she did not listen to me. Forget all that. Take this doll and throw it in places like Al-Qaeda, IS. Correct. What will you do for me if I take it out? If you do that, out of ten cases on you, I will adjust three. So, you are going to put me in jail again. You have to face the consequences. As if you know the true meaning. Whatever it is, you have to. Listen, you have got only half-day permission. Take the doll immediately. I need to hand you over in Puzhal jail. Immediately? Do I look like a daily labourer to you? If I should do 'pooja', I need to fast for three days and perform. 'Swamy', please don't say this. You look like a skeleton already. If you fast for three days, you might even die. Then, we can only handover your dead body to jail. Fasting is not for me. For you all. 'For us?' Yes. Have you decided or not? - Are you kidding? Should we fast for three days, just to take this doll? I will take it in three minutes. Will you touch it? What if I touch it? - Can you touch it? No, don't go. - Looks like he will touch it. No, Aadhi. - Don't. Be calm, sister. Don't believe whatever he says. Do you know what will happen if you touch it? What will happen? Spice. If you eat spicy, your chest will burn. You will be hungry, you will feel dizzy. You will start panting, and heart will beat. This is the daily happening of the human body. No. I mean, today is the last day for all that. You are kidding. - Huh? Gosh. Uncle! Is it you? Did he do it? Your uncle is giving you his garland and calling you to him. That is not an ordinary doll. Bommayi. Yes. - Yes. Are you ready for fasting? Yes, ready. Then, note the things for the 'pooja'. 'Viboothi' one kg, 'kumkum' one kg. - Garland? Your uncle gave you the garland already. Stay quiet. You tell me 'swamy'. Then lemon twenty, coconut ten. Then three important things. Tell me 'swamy'. - One in red, one in blue and one in green. - Rope, right, 'Swamy'? No 'swamy'. Ramaraj briefs. How will Ramaraj's briefs fit the doll? That is not for the doll. For me. Then, surely it won't fit. - Gosh. Yuck. - Fine, shall we start the 'pooja'? 'Swamy'. Everything you asked for is here. Shall we start the 'pooja'? Start the 'pooja'? Madam, nothing is right as per 'Vasthu'. What should we do 'Swamy'? Nothing, that sofa to here, this sofa to there and that to here. Only then can I throw away the doll. What is the link between the doll and the sofa? Hey, don't question me. Just follow the instructions. You fatty! Do the work. - Stop and do it. Come. Bring it here. Take it there. This is done. That is also here. All done. Damn, they look bright. 'Swamy'. Shall we start the 'pooja'? - Madam, this is not enough. Still, there are things pending in 'vasthu'. This sofa should go there, that sofa should come here. The other sofa should come here. All these are pending. Oh, God. - Thank God. Only now, they look a little tired. Why are you looking so tired? All of you get up and get the things in position. Oh, gosh. There is nothing left in my body. - What? Today, somehow, he will remove the doll. Before he removes the doll, I guess I will become one. Don't talk like that. Hello, Ola. 'Ola?' It looks like he has brought his disciples. - Fraud, stop there. Gosh, I forgot. - He is running away. It is here. Got it. - Catch him, I can't. Hey, stop. - How can I catch him? Am tired. Got it. - We suffered for three days. Without OTP, he will not take me, idiot. He is leaving now. Hey, we can only keep the battery in the doll. We cannot keep sorcery through it. They are idiots in uniforms. Hey, stop! - Didn't I tell you that day? Hey. - He is gone. Wait, I won't leave. Hello. Who is it? Are you calling the commissioner? No, to the hotel. Oh. - Hello, Aadhilakshmi here. Three quail biryani, four chicken, four lollipops, and four milky bars. Four lollipops for me. Two litres of acid. Acid? For what? To pour on your face. - Hey. You went around calling him 'swamy'. Phew. - Yes. Only now can I see clearly. I should poke your eyes. Why? First, we should throw that doll out. Yes. How could we have it for so many days? Oh, damn! It is moving on its own. - Is it? Oh, Lord! Damn, is the battery on? - See, see. Look at it. - It's walking. Where is it going? How can this happen? - Gosh, I feel scared. It's scary. Take it. Oh my, I can't even look at that side. Gosh. What is that? Mayil, be careful. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Bye. A respectful doll it is. What is written? - Burn me. Aadhi. You shot the wrong person, right? - Gosh. It should be his ghost. What should we do now? If we burn that body, it will be alright. What are you saying? - Pisasu. Didn't you watch it? Correct. - Yes. How to take that body out of the mortuary? Wait, I will call uncle. Quick. - Yes, call him. Hello, aunty. It's urgent. Can you give the phone to uncle? Aarthi, your uncle, eloped with that nurse. Damn. Aunty? Even if you are calling the nurse, your aunt. Keep the phone down. Hello, aunty. Aunty! Uncle has a fever. We could also hear. Even then, your uncle's taste shouldn't be this bad. This uncle. But it's not easy to get that body, without uncle. Think of something. Damn. - Gosh. Oh, Lord! - Madam. Slowly. Open your eyes slowly. Nothing wrong with you. Open your eyes slowly. Yes. - What? Why am I in this uniform? Don't panic because of your dress. Tell us what happened to you. Yes, tell us. - Doctor. Me and baldy, were returning from Kourtalam, with those three movie-crazy fellows. Then... - Then? Two teas, please. There was a huge mountain. Inside the mountain, there was abundant water. Our heroine is jumping in that water. Her head is hurt. - Oh! Are we using a double? No. Isn't she getting paid? Why double, then? No. She will jump and go deep inside the water. If she goes in, won't she drown? No, she won't drown now. Huh? - Ha ha. Hey! Can't you stay silent? - Crazy girl, what? Do you want tea? - Tea? Don't you have a beer? I will puke if I have tea. Beer? Hey, baldy. Come and take care of him. - Baldy! What is it? - If he hears us, he will hit us. - I will kill you all. Brother, did you see anyone wearing a red shirt? Him again? I am waiting for customers already. Move aside. Hey, Maari. Are you still searching for him? Yes, baldy. Because of that red shirt, mad fellow, they are making me suffer. They are saying that, they will suspend me. If I go for a job outside, they are asking for my previous job details. If I say that it's a mental hospital, they see me like a crazy man. I can have the job only if I find that red-shirt guy. Hey! Are you searching for a red shirt? That crazy man was wearing a red shirt when he went missing. That's why I am searching for that. - Hey. That is not 'seapu' (red colloquial), it's 'sivapu' (red). 'Seapu'. - 'Sivapu'. Soap it is. - Soap? Gosh. - That is not 'sivapu'. It is 'sigapu'. If I tell this, they will call me mad. Tell orange. - 'Anju'. He cannot pronounce any colour properly. He won't have a job. Direct retirement. - Hey. You are struggling just to search for one person. Look at me. Managing so many people over there. Do you know? You are great, baldy. You should live well. - Hey, me? You both should live well. - Thank you. Have a great life. - That's like it. Let's help him, baldy. Will you shoot anyone, if you have a gun in hand? Won't you tell before shooting? We need to see... It's her! Our movie's heroine. - The person before shooting him. Take the vehicle. Now. - Wear the seat belt. Seat belt. - Put two days' leave and come. Let's search for him. - I have enough work. Tell me if you see the red shirt. - Leave now. Why is there no wind blowing through the window? The vehicle is not moving. There is no driver yet. - Hmm. Hey, from today, you aren't my co-director. My driver. Take the vehicle. - Yes, boss. Take. - Go now. Put on the gear and start the vehicle. Go fast, take it. It's past six. First, turn on the lights, as per 'vasthu'. Blow the horn. - Yes, right. What is the sound? The vehicle is moving, baldy. Hey, stop. - Catch them. Come on. Run. Stop there. Wait. - I am not baldy if I let you go. Catch them. Stop. - Hey, stop. Stop. - Stop. Hey. Baldy is chasing us. Hey, drive in twelfth gear. This is a new model vehicle. There are only ten gears. Fine, whatever. Just go fast. My pen has fallen. Stop. - Engine off. Hey, stop. - Stop. Hmm. - Couldn't find my pen. Oh, are you taking it that way? Now, I will close my eyes and take the shortcut. Beautiful dear. Oh damn. Stop there. - Gosh. What is this, baldy? Hey, don't move. - Catch them. Phew. It's cold. Drink this diesel. You will be fine. Hey. - Hey. It's baldy. - Will they hop in too? Hey, hey! Damn, the vehicle is shaking. Baldy. Get the van inside the water. Let's hide there. Come on. - Hey. "I will be happy from today." - Baldy! Damn. - Oh, God! Gosh! Mr Baldy is the reason for our death. Damn, this fellow. Hey, baldy. Damn, the evidence. Damn. Damn. - Thank God. You ate the evidence, baldy. What can we do now, madam? That, too, is in our custody. - Huh? Not in our custody, baldy. In your custody. How can you part us like this, madam? You are like my sister. Huh? - Don't tell this to anyone. I surely won't tell, baldy. But? What but? If they hit me, I will tell them, baldy. Huh? Will you tell if they hit you? - Yes. Shall I tell you a story? Huh? At this time... - It should be said at this time. Fine. - Okay. Before a few years, a woodcutter and his beautiful bald son, lived in the forest. - Huh? Hmm. - One day, that beautiful baldy, was getting tea for his father. In that forest, a woman was raping his father brutally. Yes? - Yes. When he saw that, ran off scared. As he feared he could be next. He ran and ran, far off from there. Finally, he stopped at a bridge like this. Isn't it too cold? Yes. - Wait a minute. If you wear this over your head, it will be alright. - Is it? Go ahead with the story, baldy. Then, what he did was, that beautiful baldy, saw that woman running from there. Then, he peaked in the river. Something big... - Big? Jumped. - You killed me, baldy. She will tell if they hit it seems. Tell now. What is this? You should've been cautious, when he said a woman raped his father. I went close, as I got interested in a different kind of story, doctor. If the police gets to know this, they will turn the hospital upside down. Keep it a secret. That is not so easy. There are a lot of problems in that land. Hey! - That's not needed. I will tell you about a different land. If possible, let's see it in person. Hey, just listen to me. Leave that. Who are you? What are you doing here, alone? No, sir. I am on duty here. Huh? They can't assign duty over here. A minister's body is coming tomorrow. So security duty for me. For the one dying tomorrow, have they assigned duty today itself? Are they that advanced? - Yes, today. Nice, right? - Oh, ho. I thought I would be alone. Huh? Thank God you are here. Oh ho. She is calling me. Married? Come, come. Yes, married. Then, not our league. What to do? - Why did you go away? What's the use of being married? That guy died the same night. She is calling me. Is it your lunch? Dinner. Do you want to eat? I was shocked when you said married. I became happy when you said he died. Do you want to eat? No, I just ate and came. You can go. Who are you talking to? No, it was crowded there. In this area, I am the only crowd. Why are you saying so? The area is terror-filled. Terror filled? - Yes. Pour me. - Okay. Why are you saying terror filled? Pour, I will tell. - What bad smell is this? Liquor smell. It will be bad. Damn, fellow. Did you make me pour for you? It's my long-time wish to have a drink served by a woman. You idiot. She is hitting me. Why are you hitting me? Both of us wear khakis. Why should we have any lack of love? Pour. - I can't. Then, I will leave. I will see... - Gosh. Did you get angry? I will pour for you. Really? Yes, really. Come. - That's a friendly invite. Pour. Good. - It's served. Damn, drink this. I've poured enough. Drink. Didn't you mix water? Water? Should I do that too? You mix. That when you do that all I will feel happy. - Go. That's why I am asking. Ha ha ha. There is some noise. Did you notice? This is how it will open and close frequently. Because it's a very dangerous area. To sit here, you need to be brave. - Oh. I can't stand this smell. I also felt like that, when I had the first drink. Cheers. You are alone in this kind of place. Won't there be anyone along? All of them are cowards. Do you mean there is a ghost here? What is this, dear? You are pretty, educated and a policewoman. In this twenty-first century, you are questioning ghosts. Not so... - There are ghosts. What is this, Mayil? There is a group of ghosts inside. That too, the one in number four, he will keep dancing. Why? - He died under liquor influence. Yes. Sixty-three after twelve? Mayil? What is this? The numbers are not in sequence. I feel very confused. - You should be. Suddenly a doctor arrives. Take twelve, take five will be their orders. They will torture me. They should search without me. Morning duty doctor, should be confused. Yes. Number thirteen is missing. - Leave that. There is a lady in number six. She died just because her boyfriend died. - Pch. His number is twenty-seven. She is in six. I will keep them away time and again. But they will always be together. What? You are telling all this as comedy, right? Why, dear? You are pretty, educated, and a policewoman. In the twenty-first century, how can you ask if this is a comedy? I am talking quite seriously. I can show you if you come inside. If you get scared of this, what will happen if I tell you the other thing? There is this number thirteen. If number thirteen is out, we all should be silent. Gosh? That one is very scary. So, if it comes out, we should just run away. Great success. Why are you calling success for just one round? One round? - Yes. What? Hey, did you make me drink? What is this? You look pretty. Educated and a policewoman. In the twenty-first century, are you questioning drinking? Don't waste it. I got it in black from Tasmac. Idiot. - Damn. You fire yourself. I cannot, Mayil, please. You shot him. Now you should only do the ritual. Only then can he rest in peace. Here. I'm sorry. Mayil. Did you see someone wearing a red shirt? No! Hey, come here. - Sir. How dare you touch the police? Sir, they said the police are your friends. Hey, who are you? What are you doing here? I am searching for a person wearing a red shirt, madam. Well, what are you doing? - Huh? Are you questioning police officers? We are... Just having a fire, as it is cold. Yes. Can I also join you? I feel very tired. Fine. - Okay, go. But how will it be cold in May month? If I kick you, you will be in the fire. Huh? - Rascal. Hello. - Come to the mortuary right away. Aadhi. What happened? Come now. - Come quick. Hey, red shirt. If only I find you, I will hit you nicely. Where are you, red shirt? Since the old doctor is missing, I will be in charge here. Idiot, where is the body number thirteen? Sir, didn't I tell you from the start? Thirteen is uncontrollable. It will be roaming around somewhere. Answer properly. - Aadhi. We can't respect you. - Answer. We've burnt the body already. Let us leave. What is the use of burning the body? Look what's happening. Why? What happened? The relations of the body you burnt, are these many. You all leave and come back in two days. Hey, don't insult my wife. I will break your mouth. Where is my wife's body? Doctor, I will find the body. Gosh, was the body in a number thirteen his wife's? That... Then... Then, where is the male body that was in number thirteen? - Fine. How did you know there was a male body in number thirteen? That... That... If it's female now, it should've been male before, right? Correct. I burnt it with three thieves' bodies. Fine. You were giving me company from earlier. How can you talk so clearly? - Take off your hands. All problem is because you were drunk and irresponsible. You doubt the police. - Ahem. I will hit you, mind it. Doctor, look at her. She is pretty, educated and a policewoman. In the twenty-first century, she lies without shame. Doctor, she poured, and I drank. If you don't believe me, you can watch that CCTV video. Damn, there is CCTV. Gosh. - Gosh. Hey, since morning, they were complaining about the CCTV not working. You forgot that and enquiring the policewoman. Hit him, madam. Useless fellow. She is hitting me. - Aadhi, it's the time. Let's leave. I am a doctor. Hey, can't you correct the camera? Are you even a doctor? Listen, Aarthi, the body of the one you shot is already burnt. You can stay in the house bravely, without any tension. Hmm, okay. 'Who am I?' 'Did you see me?' What? No? Aadhi. Come. Why did you stop there? Fear. Weapon to kill humans. I am here. Come. 'Mind games?' Who are these people? Who? I can't see anyone. The dude will stab you. 'I will not die before getting an Oscar.' 'As per the story, heroine is getting angry.' 'First, I have to write the story and release it.' Stupid people are stealing everything. How did you all come here? How did you all die? - Oh. Are we visible to you just now? We have been with since a long. We are waiting for your call sheet every day. - Fan is rotating. - Hey! What are you doing here at my house? Didn't you know when we were singing a lullaby for you? Hey Babu, shall we start a song? Start the song. Hey, director. Did you see it there? - What? Three people like us are lying there. Hey, mad. We are those three. So, did we die? - No, we have become ghosts. So we can narrate our story to M.G.R, Babu. These people will do a review stating that M.G.R. doesn't act well. That face is looking good. Hey, director. Did you see it there? Our heroine is going. Hey! "My dear". No matter even if we have become a ghost. We have to make a movie with our heroine. "My dear!" "Hey, my dear. Oh, my dear." "Catch my darling." "Catch my darling." "Heroine." "My dear, are you ready?" "Shall we all go? - Are you ready?" "Either if we are ruined or have become a ghost." "We will not give up on our aim." "Catch my darling." "Catch my darling." Hey, what is this? There are fights on all the channels. What is this? - Gun, that's why they are shooting. Hey, director, I have one idea for a title. How is it? 'I will kill you' It is not good. Shall I choose a title? 'I will kill you'. How is it? Wow! We have already named it 'Ghosty'. Now why are you talking nonsense? Look, our artist is sleeping like an animal. Shall we wake her up? - Yes, do it. "People are..." Kala master. Our artist is here. "...searching you." Madam, Sadhasivam has expired. Wow! Good news! That big-belly man wishing for Kanaga was a big mistake. Oh my dear, listen to this news. Stop the song. - Do makeup for our heroine. It is being done. Then obliterate it and start again. "The game is on fire." "We are also an Avengers team now." "A lot of plans and scenes. - Rose milk." "The sketch is too clean and we will get a screening in Oscar." "It is a wonderful set and it is going to be a great hit." "It is an ultimate scene." "Catch my darling." "Catch my darling." "Hey! My darling." Take the sandal garland. "Hey! My darling." "Hey! My darling." "Hey! My darling." "Hey! My darling!" Who is this long-nose guy? Looks like a stand-up comedian. Priest, please send them away at any cost. Oh, he is here to send us out. Please, send them out. Hmm. - What can you do? Hey, wake him up. He is sleeping. (Chanting a spell) (Chanting a spell) 'He talked in Tamil while coming here' 'but now he is talking in some foreign language.' Hey! We are all Tamil ghosts. Tell the spell in Tamil. Why are you using a foreign language? Huh? If he chants the same spell smash the skull on his head. 'I don't have any relatives.' 'I was born in a graveyard without seeing my dog' Hey, priest! This song is sung in a graveyard. Madam, is he a priest or a mortician? We will not go, get lost. What is this, Priest? We will not go. - You keep quiet for a while. Always calling me a priest. Keep quiet. Hey Babu, he sells fish in Kasimedu. Yes, I know. Look at his face. - Did you hear his accent? What are you looking at? In the place to do the ritual, he is mourning. Wait, you guys. We will give him a chance in our movie. Why is he playing with flowers? Hey! Move that rose over there. - How much did you pay him? He is working too hard. - He has moved the waste towards me. Did he see me taking that? (Chanting a spell) (Chanting a spell) Yes, tell me. (Chanting a spell) Keep calm. Your blood pressure might rise. What is he doing? - What happened, priest? Are you going to dance? Why is he in this pose for so long? Why is he in this weird position? Om! Cream! Hey, throw him out. I am sleepy. Why did he lift his leg? Bro! He is wearing an inner with stripes. I saw that while he was sitting. - Is that so? Hey! Keep quiet. - Why? A girl is here. - Sorry, priest. That's why I didn't take off the dhoti. Ah. What happened? Where is the vehicle going? Nothing will happen no matter what you do. Tickle him. Hey! Hey! Will you not keep quiet? I will kill you all. - You, Stupid guy. Who will you kill? I am lying as I am tired. He will kill, it seems. Do you recognise who he is? The one who lost in cock fight. That's why his nose is like a hen's nose - No, dude. He is like the one in the 'Asuran' movie. The one who got fritter for Jayam Ravi in 'Comali' movie. He lost that too. - Hey, take those holy powders. Give it to him. - Take it, priest. Is that your uncle's skull? Did you throw the holy powder on the director? You, too, take it. - Throw it on him. (Making weird noise) He has thrown it on me. We will take revenge on him for this. - Hey, sit down. Hit on him. - Don't go, priest. Have it. - Is he leaving? I have shooed away many ghosts in my life like vampires, Dracula, Chinese ghosts and Japanese ghosts too. But I have never seen mad ghosts like them. Not just in Indian cinema, we could've never seen mad ghosts, even in Hollywood cinema. Priest, don't appreciate us too much. I feel shy. - Hey, you will not be good. You all will be ruined. Thank you, priest. Same to you. Why are you leaving so soon, priest? - Priest. Is there no other way for this? There is only one way. You have to bring the person whom they were scared of when they were alive. There is no other way. - Look, you cannot do anything to us, no matter who you bring. - Get going. Isn't our heroine pity? - Who were you all scared of? We are scared of no one. Hey, mad. We are scared of that Baldy. 'I am here, madam.' 'Oh, no! Baldy!' 'Turn off the generator. Pack up everything.' Why did you tell? - He is bluffing. We are not scared. Hello. Mental hospital? I have inquired properly in the hospital. They have dismissed the Baldy. They gave me the address that he is here. Behind this. Here? This house. Madam, did you see the Warden Baldy somewhere? I am searching for that idiot, sir. He borrows the money but didn't return it. I am planning to lodge a complaint on him. Inform me when he is coming. - Okay, sir. (Voice on the radio) (Voice on the radio) (Voice on the radio) Police came in search of me. You are calling as if this is an issue. We are getting ready for another murder. Hang up the call. - Hey! How are you? - What happened? Why did you return so soon? You are changing your appearance as if you are actor Kamalhasan. Come. Hey, Baldy. Come out. - Hey, drum head, what's all this? Aren't you ashamed to do this to a woman? We are taking you this way as you are wearing a saree. If not, We would have taken you naked. Do you know who I am? We got what we needed. Walk silently. - Madam! Will you shave your head every day? - I will drape the saree properly. Go as if this is a silk saree. Aarthi, take him home and shoo, away those in your house. Okay. - We will follow you. The villain is coming with a knife. Heroine sees him. Why am I getting a cigarette smell? - Hey, director. Our heroine is here. Did you see it? - Oh. Is she smoking? - Hey! Where were you? We have to shoot. Go and get changed. Come in. Hey, did you see who is here? Isn't she looking like Baldy's sister? Huh? It is not his sister. It is Baldy himself. Get in. - Oh no! Baldy! - Go. Run! Come here. Look here, the Baldy is here. - Run. Come here. - Who is here? I can't see anyone. I guessed it correctly. She is mad. Look here. - My body is burning. Catch him. - Madam! It's aching. Are you scaring me? Are you disturbing me at my house? Look what I am going to do to you. Hey, look at him. Go, Baldy. - Leave me, madam. Come here, everyone. Come. - No. You will disturb me only when you are out. I'm going to lock you all inside. Hey, Baldy, you have to shout once in two minutes. Make noise. - No, ma'am. My body is burning. - Good. If you don't shout, I will get to know by the cameras that are here. You have to keep making noise. If not, I will press the remote and you will get shock. Hey, Baldy, there are no cameras here. That is AC remote. She is fooling you. Listen to me. - Heroine, why is your lip not syncing? Ask that to Deepa Venkat. - She hit me. Madwoman. She hit me! Is she mad? She tied me all alone. (Makes noise) - You look like a liquor-selling lady. Hey Daya, look what he is doing. Is he sleeping? He is handing, brother. - Where is he hanging? He is hanging himself. - Hanging? - Yes, brother. Hey, get him down. Hey, catch him. Hey, get him down. Make him sit. - Make him sit. Sit down. - Hey, Dass. You? - Hey! He remembers me even after years. Only that guy forgot. Hey, why were you about to hang out? - Ask why. He has already questioned you. Why should he repeat it? I have three sons. - It is too much. One is in Pakistan. - Haa. One is in Sri Lanka. - Ha. And one is in China. - All are enemy countries. Not just in enemy countries. They have also become my enemies. How? - They never call me. There is no need for it. They are not asking if I had my food. There is no necessity for it. Neither my grandchildren are talking to me. You'll not understand even if they talk. They got married without informing me. No expenses for you. So, I thought of killing myself instead of being an orphan, Dass. Okay, go ahead. - Okay. Hey! What is this? You were an inspector. Don't you know to kill yourself is a mistake? Yes. Then how can I die soon, Dass? Tell me. Revenge. I am here to kill you. Wow, nice. Kill me. Why is he laughing? - Aarthi already told me. Kill me. You shouldn't laugh. You should be scared. Okay, I got scared. Kill me. You shouldn't laugh... I'll kill you only when you are afraid. Dass, I am not afraid to die, rather I want to die. Kill me. Hey, I have to get the mood to kill you. Do you understand? That mood is that I have to see fear in your eyes, and you should stammer. Your legs should shiver. I will kill you only if you are scared of death. Hey, is he telling you a story? Act like you are scared. Oh, no. I am scared. He is scared. Kill him now, brother. Is this called acting? Brother, if I ask you to kill him, you are directing him. Brother, he is doing something. Let us kill him and leave. Stab me. How can I kill him if he is laughing? This is why I acted. Come, my dear. Why am I hearing bells before stabbing? Calling bell. - Sir, tablets. Come. - Medicine shop guy. I asked him to bring the blood pressure tablets. Go and get them. - Ha. Go and get uncle's blood pressure tablet. Okay, brother. Ask him to sit. I will get it. - Sit down. Why is he walking as if he has piles? I have that too. What do you not have? That is why I am taking tablets, so, I will have no disease while dying. Then remove all his clothes. I have to die with pride. Hey, tablets! Bring it fast. Why are you delaying? - Here is the tablet. Give it. Bro, put it in his mouth. - Bro! Bro! That is not the one. - Put it in his mouth. Bro, don't give it. Bro, that is not his tablet. Dude, why are you late? Where is the tablet? - They gave your tablet to him, sir. Don't make this public. Dear, come fast. Why are you eating tablet like candy? What tablet did you give? This is his tablet, sir. Then this? - That is a great tablet, sir. That tablet? - Good night, sir. Why is he blowing with his mouth? Why is he making a weird noise? Hello. Hey, he will die for one such tablet. You gave him three such tablets. - Yes, he is dead. Did he die? Oh, no! What about my revenge? Hey, close the door. I will stab him. Oh, no! Are you going to do the same? - You, shut up. We will look into it in three more cases. Are you saying so? - Yes, brother. This knife is not lucky. Buy something more powerful. Uncle, listen to me. I am sure that Dass has killed him. Dass didn't kill him, dear. Do you know how did he die? I am ashamed to tell you that. No, uncle. You don't know about Dass. Aarthi, he cannot do anything to us. You were a baby when we arrested him. Don't we know him? - Uncle, please. Aarthi, go and do your work. This is not a matter of concern. You go. - Go, dear. Hello. - Hi, Aarthi. I murdered your Madhan uncle in a unique way. I was the one who gave him those tablets. Brother. You would have heard about mercy killing. Have you heard of lust killing? Dass, I am the one. I will kill one tonight from the three who are remaining. I have a different item for him. Don't keep talking. Kill him and come fast. Hey, no dialogues for this time. Only action. Sir, did you see anyone with a red dress? Hey, is this the time to ask address? You look like a high-class killer. That's why I asked. You caught my hand. Did you see the thing in my hand? Hey, get lost. Sir, did someone see anyone wearing a red colour shirt? Hey! Hey, don't shoot. Dass! No! Surrender to me. - Hey! Hey, start the vehicle. Bro, come fast. She will shoot him. Let's escape before she shoots properly. Uncle. Hey! Aarthi. Why are you here at this time? Do you know what happened here? Dass was trying to kill you. I was the one who saved you. Why are you repeating Dass's name? He is not a man of concern. We sent him to jail in a fake case. He doesn't dare to kill me. Uncle, Dass! - Keep watching. You will become mad repeating Dass's name. When we were on duty... When you were in uniform, I was a baby. Isn't it? Uncle, listen to me. Be in my custody for a while. Should we be in your custody? What are you talking about, dear? Go, dear. 'How will I save all of them?' Uncle, Aarthi is mentally disturbed for a while. 'What are you telling?' As it has increased, we have admitted her to a mental hospital. 'Mental hospital?' - Yes. 'We will come there immediately.' - Okay, uncle. Car. Car. Car. Car. When did you admit her? - Yesterday. Thank God. Her father didn't see her in this condition. Which side? - This side, uncle. Haa. Come. She was completely fine, uncle. I don't know what happened all of a sudden. She is shouting. She was acting weird yesterday night I didn't know what to do. - Come, let's go soon. So, I admitted her here. As it is very severe, the certificate is also typed. Is the certificate typed? She was a good girl. Where is she now? Here. Here? - Do one thing. - Aarthi. Aarthi. - Aarthi. Aarthi dear. - Aarthi. Dear. Aarthi. - Where is she? Hey! - Hey, Mayil. What are you doing? - What are you doing? Why are you locking the door? - Aarthi! Aarthi, what is this? - Why did you lock us here? My dear, darling. Don't play with us. Why did you lock it? Open it. Sorry, Uncle. - I insist you open it. I don't have any other option to save you from Dass. Are you saving us? Don't do this, dear. - What are you doing? We have a lot of work. Listen to us. I am so sorry. We know to save us. - Thank you, doctor. It's okay, ma'am. We can do anything for the goodness of a few people. Aarthi. - Aarthi. Hey, what is this girl doing? Hey, Mayil. Are you also playing games along with her? Hey, Mayil. Aarthi. Take uncle's car key. Doesn't he know anything other than this howling sound? Son of a wolf. Hey, who are you? Car. Car. Car. Hello, doctor. A girl from the hospital came with me in the car boot. - Car. Okay. Car. - Okay, doctor. Come in. When did you get in the car? What is your name? Did you have something? Madam! My throat is hurting as I have been shouting. Can I have ginger tea? As if he is Yesudas. He is going to sing breathlessly after drinking the tea. Baldy. Why is the ant biting me? Car. Hey, who are you? Dass? My dear lions. Did you come to save me? Come. Hey, what are you doing here? Didn't you go to the hospital? Didn't you come to save me? Go and save him. Hey, Baldy, where did they get you? You are caught here. - Hey, take that guy from here. - Hey, hit her and ask where are those three. Sister. - Hey, don't. Does she know gymnastics? Yoga. Huh? - Ha. Hit her and enquire. I will smoke and come back. Come fast. Let's fight. Let the fight get completed. We will go later. Sit down. Hey, get lost. You go. I am scared. 'Hey, what are they doing? They are going there and falling by themselves.' Why is he falling? Wait, I will be back after a call. Go. Dude, aren't you getting sound like our men being hit? Oh, no! Ouch! Ah, brother. You told me that Dass is a goon. He let us get hit and got escaped. - Hey, he is always a heartless guy. Do you have a conscience? You are lying to me and are blaming me. Hey, why is everything too bright for me? Brother, we came in the night. It is night. People say that things go dark if we get hit. For me, it is the opposite. I'm sorry. You are in this situation because of me. You are not at wrong. I didn't die as you have shot me. 'Mom' 'Dad' 'Bro, don't mistake me.' 'Your magic shows have become too old.' 'Why don't you come to our company in London?' 'I will arrange a good job for you.' 'No, sir.' 'There is a girl child who is under my care.' 'Passport - What is this, bro?' 'You are caring as if she is your own child.' 'Her own parents threw her on the street.' 'Why are you carrying this fate with you?' 'Join her in an orphanage and come with us.' 'It is very difficult to get a passport for her.' 'Sir, I have checked the car very well. Shall I pay him?' Okay, sir. I will give it. Thank you. - Sir, that policeman asked a lot of times. You didn't sell it then. What happened to you now? Poverty. - Everything will be alright, sir. Don't worry. Shall we leave? No! Car. Car. We will leave. It is big just for the appearance. Hey, who is he? Hey, check if he has a laptop in his bag. Hey! My money. Hey! Hey! Give it to me. Dass, stop. I will shoot you. Dad. Dad. She is also an orphan like me. She has no one other than me. When I think of her future... - Don't worry. I will take care of her from now on. She will be with me. I told you that lady is weird. (Makes a weird sound) - Hey! Why are you making that weird sound? It became a habit as I have been shouting for the past couple of days. What became a habit? I feel ashamed. You have all got hit by a woman. Why are you laughing? I got hit on the stairs in the leg. Yes. - Yes, they said. - The car is here. Stop the car, throw him out and get the car. Hey, stop. Hey, stop. - Hey. I insist you stop. Oh, no. Hey idiot, you are bringing shame. - He insulted us, dude. Hello, Dass's legs are hurting, get off the car. We need the car. Who is Dass? - Hey! Did you ask who Dass is? Keep quiet. Who is Dass? Brother, Turn slowly and show your face. DGP sir. Forgive us. My men played without knowing that it was you. (In chorus) Please, sir. Consider me as your sister, sir. You are too tall. Take it lightly in your heart. We have to produce them in court tomorrow. Keep them safe in custody. Be careful. - Sure, sir. - Sir. Baby, come here. You! Baby? - Hey! - Bring the key. We will see to later. What happened in the house? Do you know who did we shoot? Come, he is listening. Let's go inside and talk. It will be boring if there is no woman in the unit. - I am here. Hey! Unit? I meant the police unit. You told me something on call. What happened? Pity. He has adopted a kid. The goons killed him before we shot him. His soul is always around the girl. He saved me from Dass's men. Baldy with saree. Baldy. - Hey! We can't do the short film if Baldy is here. Open the lock-up. I am scared of Baldy. I can't. Then close the door and open it. I got an idea. Hey, you bring the key. I will go and bring the key. What is this? - This is a milk cooker, go. Milk cooker? Why are they having that in the police station? To prepare tea for the inspector. Oh, no. Baldy. Come and open. I felt too bad as I shot him. Open fast and throw the black lizard out. He was the one who saved me. I was the only one who was able to see him. How is the door opening by itself? See, is he coming out or not? Are they planning to kill us in the encounter? Uncle has got his car. - We are not worth encountering. You may not be worth it. But he is worthy of it. Brother, it is a good chance. Shall we escape? Are you saying so? Ladies first. I will go first, brother. Hey, you. Are you a woman? Assistant first. You go. Bless me. - Bless you. We will come only if you are good. His soul went away only after I told him that I will take care of that girl. Oh, no. His blouse is torn. He threw them out of the house. Oh, did they escape that way? Carry forward. Why is our heroine always dull? She is not smiling for anything. Hey, ask her if she's coming or should I shoot inside? What is this noise? You idiots. Why did you open it? We can't shoot if Baldy is here. So, we have released him and we are shooting. Did they run away? Hey, Mayil. Catch him. - Hey! Go and catch him. The guy is going. (Saying some random words.) You are standing in front of me leaving the accused DGP handed over. Are you not ashamed? Sorry, uncle. No, uncle. Only, sir. Sorry, sir. I didn't do it, sir. You were a kid when your father was training us. You had toyed with you. - Did you see that? I was the one who raised you. Hey! Keep it over there. - Greetings, sir. What happened? You will not believe even if I tell you. What? Your ghost story? Nonsense. Here is your suspension order. Do your best and prove yourself. Sir. Long nose. The job is done. I will wait outside, Come. Uncle, I didn't write this. (In chorus) We were the ones who wrote it. You! - Get out. Uncle. - Out. It will go away if you rub it. Hey, open the door. Hey, did you lose your job? - Shall we go for the shoot? Hey, I am asking you. - Why did she throw it down? Hey, Baldy. Stop! Hey, how long will you be rotating? Stop her. You have put towels like 'Anbe Vaa' Saroja Devi. Ask her where those three are. Where are your three uncles? Tell me. Baldy is putting many get up. Will you tell or not? Hmm. Did you see what she did do? She is spitting. Why are you showing your head again and again? Is it rosewater or perfume? You are getting it very often. I don't know what he is up to. Hey, what are you looking at? Help me. You cowards. Come. Why are you standing here? Brother, didn't I tell you she is a different one? I am asking you to help me. You are shooing us every day. Why are you asking us to help now? Bite Baldy's throat. We will help you. - It is a very old rope. Break it and run away. Aren't you ashamed to tell yourself as ghosts? Hey, is she talking to us about us? Hey, you are also taking to yourself being a police officer. Aren't you ashamed of it? I think something happened to her as she was rotating for a long. She is like that, she always talks alone in a place where no one is there. Do you know how did she torture after tying me up? You! Hey! Tell me who is there. - Hey, save me. Save me! - Oh no. Hey! - Here? Hey! - What are you doing? - Tell me. - Hey! Who is here? - Don't come near, brother. Hey, leave me. - Hey, listen to me. Hey! Hey, Baldy. Stop it. My head is spinning. - Here? Here. Who is here? She is planning to do something to escape. You are also playing with her. You have tied me up like a coward and showing your power. Do you know what it is called? Didn't I tell you that she will ask such questions? Hey, there are only ten more hours for brother's challenge. Tell me where they are. If not, we will not see that you are a female cop. Hey, one. You are talking too much. Baldy! Hey, shoot. Hey, sit down. 'It will shoot very well, brother.' 'It will rotate very well, brother. It will rotate, will it shoot?' It will shoot for sure, brother. Shoot and try. Ah! Why did you shoot like an old Villain? I am unable to bare it, brother. Old is gold. If you can't, move from here. Hey! The next word coming out of your mouth should be about their whereabouts. Tell me. Sir! Don't mistake me as I am asking you again. Did someone come here with the red colour shirt? I will become red if you shoot me, sir. I am leaving from here. I told them that I didn't know. Why is he running like this? Everyone is mad here. Will you maintain your pride as there are only ten more hours for the completion of the challenge? Did you think I would surrender to you? There is no need for it. Die. Sister. Sister. Sister. - Dass! She is a kid. Listen to me. Do you need those three oldies or this kid? Keep quiet. Countdown starts. Please. Three. Please don't do it, Dass. Do anything to me. No, Dass. Don't. One! What happened to Dass? Countdown starts. Three. - Please, Dass. No, Dass. Don't. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Where did these rats come from? Hey, where did they come from? Hey! - Brother. Hey! Nancy. Nancy, darling. Nancy, why did you escape as a family? Come dear, Nancy. Nancy. Hey, who are you? My rat's name is Nancy. Did you see Nancy? - I will not see. - Hey! The scientist has come in search of Nancy. Hey, is your Rat's name Nancy? - Yeah. Sister. Nonsense. I have been asking you for so long. Did you give it? He has brought the water bottle. Snatch it from him. - Oh, no! Give it. If not, I will shoot you. Hey, get it and come. - Give it. No. - Have it, brother. Stop it. - Hey, leave it. Hey, listen to me. Don't open it. - Wait, man. Don't open it. Listen to me. Hey. One more guy is going to join us. Sir, listen to me. Don't open it. - Open it fast, man. Sir, don't open it. - Wait, man. You will be changed if you open it. 'Madam, we went to a scientist's house and opened a bottle.' 'All three of us smelled it, madam.' Sir, don't open it. You will be changed if you open it. - Brother, drink it. Hey, wait. - Don't open it. I have opened it. - Hey, what, man? Thank God you didn't smell it. - What if I smell it? Hey, come. NO! Everything is Karma, sir. Very proud of you, my dear child. Thank you. - Welcome back to the police force. Thank you, Uncle. Sir. All the best. Thank you, sir. Is everything okay, dear? Yeah! Now, we have arrested this gang. What will you do for the gang that is with you? - I have a plan for that. A director is asking. Are you keeping quiet? Will you never agree for acting in our movie? How did you get a promotion? Open your mouth and tell. Where are you looking at? Who is this? Looks like a Joker. Look at her. The next bowler is here. Madam doesn't know that we are not out batsmen. She doesn't look like a Priest. - Are you from Malaysia? She is like a mini monster. Look, we will not get out of this house no matter what you do. Hey, if you tell me that you will not act in my movie then I have to show my full form. Accept. Tell bye to her and accept our deal. Will you accept or not? Get lost! - Get lost? - Please, madam. Save me at any cost. Many priests like you have come here and tried, but nothing worked out. Please save me from these ghosts, ma'am. If your problem has to be solved, tell the spell in this paper to them. They are not going away for any spell, madam. Please, try something new. Tell that. I will look after them in part two if they don't go. Madam. Do it. Bye, Malaysia Aunty. Did you tie your skirt on a tree? Move away. Say a word that will satisfy us. Tell fast. - Tell fast. We will not leave you. - Should our wish not get fulfilled if we become ghosts? Our enlightenment is in your hands. Tell. - Will you accept or not? Tell. Okay. Lights on. Camera. Rolling, action! Sha, boo, three. It's you. Why are you behaving like kids? I will tell you who the Chief Minister is. Hey! You are looking for lice in this head. I will forgive that too. I will not forgive that story against women. Where did he go? God, help me somehow. Priest, did someone come here with a red shirt? My God! Hey, mad guy. I have been searching for you. Hey! Wait! I lost my sleep, job and life because of you. Hey, wait. Hey, red shirt! Hey you madman, wait. Hey, madman. Did you escape from hospital to carve this? You! Hey, red shirt!
