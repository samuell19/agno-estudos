(dramatic music) (tires squealing) (cat yowls) (car thuds) (light orchestral music) - Mommy? Mommy, where's Daddy? He promised he'd be back and you said it'd be on my birthday. - Don't be silly, Doris, of course he's coming back. I'm sure he's on his way right now. Probably stopped off to buy you a birthday present. You wouldn't be all mad about that, now would you? - Of course not, Mommy. It's just that last year-- - He said he would come back to us, Doris, and he will. I called in sick, spent all day getting ready, and I know he will be here. He promised us, remember? - [Dash] And they waited. There was nothin' else they could do. They waited for him to return and restore them their lives. Their patience was tragic. It is he, they believe, who will come back and make her a daughter again, make her a mother, a wife. It is he, she believes, who robbed her of her twinkle and throne, her youth, her money, her wings. She saved herself for him. Saved herself beyond saving. To a spoiled sour that expects only the worst. And Doris, she grew up without a father, and all those years while it was happening, she never understood. She expects him to come back, (fly buzzing) any day now, soon. (sultry jazz music) Oh, public road. You express me better than I can express myself. I believe you are not all that is here. I believe much unseen is also here, and here, you will stay slowly. Time is not for you until the end. The tollbooth conjures up images of the big Chevy convertibles, bobby socks and poodle skirts, letter sweaters, images of the '50s. I think it's very romantic. One of the most striking features of our American road system is that the federal government did not officially build it. Tollbooths and toll roads were, and still are, privately owned. They pay for cops and road improvements, I think. That's what I love. And that's what he loves. We the people, we built 'em for ourselves. From here, he can work himself up to bein' a cop. He knows the road, waitin' for cars, day in, day out. Waitin' for people to cross in and out. Wondering what their lives are like. Where are they going to? Comin' from? Sometimes he asks. Jack, he is like the god of this crossing point. People have to get by him to get in. They gotta pay, but then you also gotta pay to get out. (cash register dinging) - Hey. - Good afternoon, Jack. - Hey, Mrs. Drake. Oh, I hate to tell you, but the tolls been raised to a dollar. - What? Really? That's criminal. Where does all the money go? I just don't seem to have any more change with me. (horns honking) I thought so, but I don't. - Look, I've got it here. (horns honking) (change jingling) Would you please tell the captain I hope he feels better real soon and comes back to work, I miss him. This new guy's a dud. Well, he is okay, isn't he? - Old fishermen never die, they just smell that way. (both laughing) (horns honking) - Have a nice day now, Mrs. Drake. Come on. - [Dash] You gotta pay to be worthwhile. (change jingling) - Thank you. Have a nice day. (upbeat rock music) - [Dash] You even have to pay to suffer the consequences. - [Doris] Hey boy. - Hello, gator puss. (Doris giggling) - 'Sup? - How ya doin'? - Good, good. Not too bad, and yourself? - What time you got? - Oh, dammit. Doris! - You're the only reason I come here. - Come on, let's move it. Yo! Can we move it on a little a bit? - Catch ya later. - Okay, bye. - Sweetheart, I got a hundred cars here. - I know. - All right, I need your help, come on. - [Doris] Okay, no problem. ♪ House is built out of brick (engine rumbles) ♪ Take my home, rock 'n roll ♪ Five inch nails through the hole ♪ ♪ My love will bleed - [Doris] Ready to go, sir. ♪ Why people go, the crucified love ♪ ♪ Darkness here on my right ♪ Turning me - Saddled up and ready to go. ♪ And the echo of life - [Dash] But all ya have to do to become some creature's god, is disappear. ♪ Inspired ♪ Found you, clean you (window rattling) ♪ Good fried - Sorry, Doris, still no sign of your father or his cab.

Why don't ya just walk over here? Have a heart, man. - [Jack] Well how do ya know it wasn't an important call? - Just don't start with that. The phone is a distraction and I don't like distractions. - [Jack] Yeah, look, look, I gotta talk to you about fishin'. - Yeah-huh. - Doris always wanted to go when she was a kid. - Yeah, well, I don't know. Whatever you say, just bring her over. I'll set ya up, no problem. - Ah, great, great. Ya know, I'm gonna sell her on this Miami idea, Dash, just you watch. - Aw, she's gonna love me in that police uniform, all them lights flashin'. (Dash chuckles) And then, after a couple of years, I'll make detective like on Vice. - Hey Jack, Vice isn't on the TV anymore. I told ya, those are reruns. - I know. So what? (somber rock music) (bug zapper sizzles) (camera whirring) (coin holder clicking) Oh, dear. (upbeat rock music) (coins clinking) (Jack whistling) - [Vic] Hey Jack. - Hey, Vic, how ya doin'? - Look, how much longer ya gonna be? - Couple minutes.

I gotta take my wife to, ya know, the hospital. You know how it is, right? - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, sure, no problem. - Yeah, oh? - Yeah. - [Vic] Thanks. - Hi, officer, nice night. Thank you. Ah, now that'll be me one of these days. To protect and to serve.

I mean, he might fill up, he might drive through. I mean, Jesus, Doris. It feels like my whole life I've been waitin' for a cab. - So don't wait anymore. Go to Miami already and be a damn policeman. Cop shows day and night. - Once I'm a cop, I'll be able to search for him better. I'll have all that information at my fingertips. - I'm not leavin' here until he comes home. (bar patrons chattering) - Hey, Doris, Jack. - Why are you readin' instead of writin'? - Nothin' to write about. - Hey, I'm workin' the night shift the next couple of days so I won't be around. - Well, I could use your help then in the mornin'. - Okay. Yeah. - Good. - I'll be there. - Great. See ya. (bar patrons chattering) - Why can't we just go lookin' for him? I mean, like normal people. When someone is missin', they go lookin' for 'em. - Well what if we leave and he comes here and we're not here. - Oh come on. I mean, I don't think he's just gonna drive up back into your life. - I know in my heart that he's around. 'Night, Jack. - No. Don't you dare, come here. (Doris giggles) Oh damn it, Doris. I want you. Come on, honey. You're no goddamn virgin and I love you, so why-- - Look, I told you. I can't with you. Not until my-- - I know, not until your father comes back. I know. - I just want it to be special between you and me. - Tell me you love me. - Jack, please, you know I do. - Yeah, but you can't say it? You are so pretty when you're faithful to me. (insect buzzing) (crickets chirping) - Goodnight, Mom. I love you. (dramatic rock music) (woman yelps) - [Larry] Gotcha! - Oh gosh, Larry. (Larry laughs) - A good cop would never leave his back turned to a room full of potential brawls. (upbeat bluesy rock music) - Ooh, you all dressed up, like you gettin' married or somethin'. (chuckles) - Forget about it. Just came back from Miami. - Did you talk to your friend in the department about me? - Sure did. Said to look him up when you're in town. I gave a good recommendation on ya, too. - Thank you. That's so great. - Told 'em you're interested in workin' vice and he laughed at that. (chuckles) Said everyone wants to work vice. Here, look him up anyway. - Thank you. (bar patrons chattering) - Where's Doris? - She's home, wants to be alone. It's birthday time again. You know how she gets. (Larry scoffs) (dramatic music) (Doris grunts) (couple grunting) - Daddy, Daddy, don't please, not my dolly, no. (Leon cackling) Daddy, you got me, don't please, not my dolly!

Come on, I won't say that ya helped. - If you wanna be a good cop. - Yeah. - Familiarize yourself. Sometimes things get so close you don't see them. You become blind, blind to the things ya need to see the most. Ya don't have to look far. Probably just down the road. (bar patrons chattering) (ominous rock music) (dramatic dark rock music) - Who was here? Was that Jack? Why don't you sleep? - You sleep enough for the both of us, Ma. Why don't you knock? - I just thought you might want something to eat. (Lillian sighs) - You're impossible. I just don't have the strength. - Go back to bed, Ma, I'll wake you for your funeral. And just leave me alone, please. (Doris crying) Come on. (Doris sighs) - So what's the best bait you got around? - Those live baiters, you know, shrimp, worms. Catch you a mean old bass. - No, no, I mean real fishin', you know, monster fishin', the ocean, big water type stuff, for when I take Doris. I wanna impress her. - Well, Doris I would fix up with a fluorescent rubber eel or a sea wormy type of job because girls don't like to cut things up, ya know? You would be best off with squid or mullet. Cut up oily mackerel. It smells awful, but it catches them quickly. - What about this here frozen stuff? - This one first, less work for me. Business sucks this year. I got to find a new gimmick. You know what the truth is? Is that most fish will go after just about any juicy, tasty tidbit that happens along, anchovies, herring, bullheads, sand monsters, menhaden, you name it. - What about hooks? - Well the hook is the most important part if ya ask me. - Yeah? - You know, there are hundreds of hook patterns that are used all over the world, and to choose the right one, you got to know the feeding habits of your intended prey. You got to know about its mouth. You got to know how does it eat? I mean, does it chomp or does it suck? Does it nibble? - Uh-huh. - Or does it grasp? Or does it simply swallow its food whole? Now for you, the O'Shaughnessy. It's the most popular hook for big game fish in saltwater. It's got a great pattern for live bait, will penetrate most heavy mouth fish. - (chuckles) Boy, you really know this stuff. I mean you could write books or articles or-- - Oh God, no way. - No, but you're a good writer. - (laughs) Yeah, you know, I'm not gonna write about fishin'. I do that for a livin' already. - Yeah, well. So, you gonna fix me up with some special lures? - You sure are placin' a lot of importance on this fishing trip, especially since I don't think Doris is gonna go anywhere on her birthday, I know her. - Shh, no, no ya don't. I mean, (sighs) you may know her in your own way, but she's my mate. (soft ominous music) Ya know, my destiny. And she's comin'. I got it all planned, ya know. It's now or never. I mean, ya either fish or cut bait, right? And I am gonna ask her to marry me, Dash. - Shoo. Well. I guess I'm gon' get to work on my special love lure. A double whammy. It's an old superstition. You got one fishin' line and a tandem jig rig. You both hold the rod. Now if you catch two fish on a double lure, you will be mated for life. But, if you only catch one, you got to throw it back so it can find its mate. - All right, rig it up. (radio static crackles) Excuse me are you Frank? The guys over there said that-- - So? - Well, they said you'd been here the longest. Maybe you could help me. - [Dispatcher] Back up on one. - Do you mind takin' a look? Do you know where I could find him? - I don't know and I don't care. - Were you his friend? - I wouldn't walk across the street to piss on him if he was on fire. Was always talkin' about mansions and limos. You know, he had a limo pick him up the day we repoed his cab? - His cab? - Yeah, it's a piece of shit rottin' out over by the rock quarry. Kids play in it. We pass by it every day. (ominous music) (insects clicking) (insects buzzing) - Found him. (Jack coughing) Yes! Yes. (suspenseful rock music) (phone buttons beeping) (phone ringing) - [Operator] We're sorry, the number you have reached is not in service.

Let's just leave the bags in the safe, huh? - We're not supposed to do that. He's gotta run it through the stupid machine, like every other night or else we won't be able to pick it up in the morning. - You do what you wanna do, huh? I'm puttin' the bags in the safe, I'm gettin' myself a beer. - [Man In Yellow Suit] Vic! - I ain't gonna wait around here all night for him. - [Man In Yellow Suit] Let's get outta here.

It'll do you good to get out of this house. - Oh, what for, so people can stare at me? Talk about me? I don't need that. - Lillian, I don't want anything from you, but ya gotta think of Doris.

Tell me that you'll miss me if I go away with Jack. - Oh, don't start, I can't take this. (chuckles) - Quit the station today. - Really? - Yup. Don't say anything to Jack, though. - Okay. - I want it to be a surprise. I think I'm gonna try it with Jack. - What? - Fishing. (Dash chuckles) Thanks. - Just, hey, stop it. Jack is your boyfriend. That doesn't mean anything to you? - Wah, he's your friend, too, but that don't stop you from bein' with me, now does it? See, you and I we're the same. We're both kinda damaged. Isn't that what you told me? - Yeah, then why don't you settle down with me? - I can't. I'm in love with Jack, really I am. It's like good, pure, white light love, clean and beautiful. When I'm with him everything's gonna be different. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Then how come if it's so good, you keep tryin' to screw it up? He knows, you know. He knows about us, he's not stupid. - Well he's gonna bring my daddy back, and I won't hassle with you anymore. - All right. - I always did wanna go fishin' with my father.

He was comin' after you. - Oh yeah, how am I gonna tell that to Doris? Hey, I found your daddy and I killed him, but it was an accident, honey. - You didn't kill him. Now listen, we gon' have to make a decision. Now either we call up the police, - Oh no. - Tell 'em what happened, or we get rid of the body ourselves, keep it between you and me, maybe Doris. (chuckles) I don't know. - I don't know. I don't know what to do. I gotta have time to think. - All right, now listen, I tell ya what. I'm just gonna take the cab round back, back a the store here, and we'll figure it out. Just think about Doris, all right? - Look, I want you to know, I knows all about you and Doris. But all that's gonna stop now. No more, no more games, no more make believe, no more playin' Daddy, 'cause I won't stand for it no more, 'cause I know now he's never comin' back to her. (Dash exhales) - I'm sorry. You know, I figured that ya knew. I was just, I was tryin' to... Well, she loves you. She's in love with you. - I know that, but that's still no excuse. You owe me now. So go on, hide this cab. You are gonna help me. (bright twinkling music) - Is something wrong? - I'm fine. - Is this a joke? - No, I just wasn't sleepy anymore. Honey. - [Doris] I'm glad you're feeling better. - I am. It's so messy in here, and it's so dingy. I'm gonna paint this week, after I finish with the garden. Have you seen it? It's all weeds. - Mom, I've gotta tell you something. I wasn't gonna say anything until tomorrow, but seeing as you're awake today. - Honey, you just wouldn't believe how much energy I have. - Please, Mom. I quit my job at the gas station today. - Sweetheart, I am so glad you-- - Shh, listen. I know that Dad isn't gonna come driving through to fill up. - Well, let's thank God for that. - No, seriously. I think he lied. I just know he's not coming back, ever. I don't know how I know, or why, but I'm gonna take care of you. I'll always take care of you. - Honey, you don't have to take care of me. That's nonsense. I can't wait to get out of this house. I mean, look at it. (Doris laughs) - What are you doin' with him? - I'm just puttin' him on ice 'til we decide what to do. He'll start to stink in an hour out there in that heat. - Oh yeah. Now he's gonna smell like fish. - But he won't decompose, and besides that, you smell like fish in this town, nobody bats an eyelash. - Yeah, well, that's true. (exhales) God, I'm sorry, I'm just itchy that's all. I gotta get on, I gotta go back to the tollbooth now. - Well let's have a drink first, relax a bit 'til we figure out what to do, okay? - All right, just for a minute, though. And I should give Doris a call. - [Dash] All right. (bright music) - You ought to be marrying one of those millionaires like Doris Day in that movie. What was it called? You know, with Rock Hudson. What was that called? - Send Me No Flowers, Mom. - Yes. Send Me No Flowers. Let's go for a walk, okay? - [Doris] Okay. - All under control. (serene music) Oh my. - I don't wanna be a prisoner here anymore. Maybe I will go to Miami for my birthday. - Oh honey, you'll love it. There's so much more to do, you'll see. - You've been to a lot of places, way back before... - Yes, I have. I was a stewardess when it was still glamorous. That was before I met your-- (phone ringing) - Hold on, I'll get that. I'll be right back. (phone ringing) Hello? - Hi, it's me, just checkin' in. - I tried you earlier but the line was busy. - Oh yeah, the phone got knocked off the hook somehow. Look I'm gonna be here for a couple more hours and then I'm gonna go on home and sleep. - [Doris] Why are you readin' instead of writin'? - [Dash] Nothin' to write about. - Then come right back again. - Hey, I've got a surprise for you. Or should I say we have a surprise for you? Can't ya come over for a bit now? - I'll come by after work. - Great. I love you. - What? - Nothing. (chuckles) I'll tell you later. Bye. - What's up, what'd she say? - She's actin' weird. (crickets chirping) - So, what'd you decide? - I don't know. I mean, what would a cop do in a situation like this, turn himself in? Nah, that's only on the TV. The cops I know would cover it up, get rid of all the evidence. With no evidence they can't find ya guilty in a court of law, everybody knows that. That's how the law works. So get rid of the body. And I don't wanna know where or how. You owe me, so just figure it out. - It's done. Now, what about the cab? - I'll decide about the taxi. - How? Wait a minute now, you can't just dump this somewhere. Now maybe I can push it, I'm gonna push it off into the swamp and we'll make it look like an accident and it'll be-- - Look, you take care of the body, and I'll decide about this. Just leave it behind the store for now. (somber guitar music) Everyone knows failure to pay a prescribed toll is a finable offense, $52 worth. Statute 316.1001.

We all thought it was the government, ya know. We're so used to 'em raisin' the taxes (chuckles) and the tolls that nobody even questioned it. - Why do you suppose they kept me on? - I don't know, so it wouldn't look suspicious, I mean, so that Vic guy could follow you, find out how it's done, I don't know.

(group applauds) ♪ Seems like everything good - See? Fiction can be stranger than truth. This is Twyla Wong, reporting live from Miami. This is the 6:30 news. - [Narrator] You know, girls are considered helpless on a fishing trip, but this girl is a good sport. This couple is having such a happy time. Hey, do ya suppose they're honeymooners? (light orchestral music) The time comes to take inventory. No point catching too many. This should take care of all the friends with deep freezers, and maybe a fish fry, or perhaps a chowder party. Now let's see nature in the raw, and it looks like big fish. This whole thing gets started by a school of minnows. Jacks come in to eat the minnows, then tarpon come in to eat the jacks, and that's where you come in. Now it's a switchover to deep sea tackle, for the fish that really test your skill is tarpon. And it's a nice one. Tarpon are strong, high-leaping fighters. They run from 50 pounds to a record 247. Remember, that fish is as big as you are and he knows how to throw his weight around. Tarpon also have bony plates in their throats, and they specialize in throwing hooks. If you lose your head or relax for one split second, look out, something's gotta give. Aw, too bad, too bad. It's tough losing your first silver king, but if it's any consolation to you, even the experts on this fighting fish admit that eight out of 10 get away. Another strike. And our heroin makes a wise decision. This is man's work. We've already lost one today, so let's play this one smart. That heavy rod's becoming a hoop. It's a torture test for tackle and your poor aching muscles. Thanks, partner. It's hard to say who's caught who. He keeps taking line out, and it's your job to bring line in. In this muscle busting there's a mental hazard. It's the lady's fish, really. She hooked him. You can't let this one get away. Is he giving up or just resting? They never give up. There's no rest with a hooked tarpon. He revives faster than you can. Man, you might as well have hooked an atomic submarine. It's dangerous hauling these giants into a boat, but when it's your first tarpon, it's a trophy, something to hang over the mantle piece. But keep away from him now. The only safe tarpon is a stuffed tarpon. Proud girl, she hooked him. A race begins to put him on ice and call the taxidermist. It's hard to believe this has been only one day for these fishing vagabonds, surf casting, water skiing, swimming, and now they're bringing back a tarpon. Tomorrow? Who thinks about tomorrow in these carefree hours of sun and fun. (dramatic orchestral music) - It's a people toe. (twangy acoustic guitar music)
