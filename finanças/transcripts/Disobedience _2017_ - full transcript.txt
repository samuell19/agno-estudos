RAV: In the beginning, Hashem made three types of creatures, the angels, the beasts, and the human beings. The angels, He made from His pure word. The angels have no will to do evil. They cannot deviate for one moment from His purpose. The beasts have only their instincts to guide them. They, too, follow the commands of their maker. The Torah states that Hashem spent almost six whole days of creation fashioning these creatures. Then, just before sunset, He took a small quantity of earth and from it He fashioned man and woman. An afterthought? Or His crowning achievement? So, what is this thing? Man? Woman? It is a being with the power to disobey. Alone among all the creatures we have free will. We hang suspended between the clarity of the angels and the desires of the beasts. Hashem gave us choice, which is both a privilege and a burden. We must then choose the tangled life (WHISPERING) We live. (GASPS) (BODY THUDS) (ALL CLAMORING) MAN: Call an ambulance. Rav. Rav. Open your eyes. RONIT: Take a breath. (SHUTTER CLICKS) And so you were 15 when you first... First got a tattoo? MAN: That one really hurt. That one hurt, and it was Jesus there. Jesus really hurt. Mmm-hmm. (SOFTLY) It's lovely. (SHUTTER CLICKS) Are you getting what you need? This is fantastic, yeah. Thank you. Are you all right? I'll need a smoke in a bit. Mmm-hmm. Five more minutes? (SHUTTER CLICKS) (PHONE RINGS) WOMAN: I got it. Mmm-hmm. Chin down a little bit. (SHUTTER CLICKS) That's lovely when you smile a little bit. WOMAN: Ronnie. Not now. (SHUTTER CLICKS) WOMAN: Ronnie. You need to speak to this man.

Yes. ls Dovid here? Yes Thank you. NAOMI: Rabbi, there's someone here to see you. DOVID: Who is it? She didn't say. DOVID: Thanks, Naomi. (GASPING) Dovid. Ronit. Ronit. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) We weren't expecting you. No? (CHUCKLES) I thought... May you live a long life. Thank you. (GASPS) I'm sorry, I forgot. Did you come straight from the airport? Yeah. Yeah, I'll go to a hotel. There's people here to honor the Rav. Right. You Okay? Yeah. HOW did he die? Pneumonia, finally. (DOOR CLOSES) I'll just find a place to put these. Take this. I'll be back. Thank you. Right. Yeah. (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Hello. Hello. Ronit. Fruma? It's really you! Moshe. Ronit, you're here. (LAUGHS) Of course you're here. Hello. Oh. Fruma. Ronit. Uncle Hartog. How are you? I'm all right. May you live a long life. (INHALES SHARPLY) Yeah. Take your coat off. Come on, and the scarf... No, I'm keeping this. And the gloves. Fruma. (FRUMA SIGHS) So, you came. Are you all right? (SOFTLY) Have you got any coffee? Can I have some? Come. DOVID: Do you still take it black? Yeah, thanks. (PLATE CLATTERS) I'll get a cab in a bit. Stay here, Ronit. Oh, no, that's all right. Thank you. Stay here. Really? Thanks. Hmm. So you came to... To mourn the Rav. Why else would I be here? You were never very predictable. Are you still angry with me? You left very suddenly. (SINGING IN HEBREW) You married? Mmm. When did that happen? Awhile ago. Say more. Who is she? Do I know her? Oh, God, it's not Hinda, is it? Dovid, you didn't marry Hinda of Hendon, did you? (LAUGHING) Oh, you did. You did, you married Hinda. Oh, shit, Dovid, no. (LAUGHS) No. (SNIFFLES) No, I didn't marry Hinda. Well, that's good. Although that does leave about 20 women out there identical to Hinda. Why are they all exactly the same? Don't be cruel. (GLASSES CLAN KING) RONIT: Hello, Esti. Ronit. How are you? I'm, um, (CLEARS THROAT) here, which is strange. ESTI: Mmm-hmm. How are you? Uh, may you live a long life. Thank you. You look very, uh, New York. (LAUGHS) Well... Goodness, you look very frum, Esti. (LAUGHING) Shall I take more food out? Don't, leave it, let's talk. Why doesn't Dovid's wife do it? When she appears. (SCOFFS) So who is Mrs. Kuperman, Esti? Do we approve? DOVID: Ronit was going to go to a hotel, but I told her she should stay with us. Ah, yes, yes. You must. Yeah, I'll fold down the bed in the spare room. I'll do it. I'll do it. It's fine. You're married. Yes. (DOVID CHUCKLES) Yes we are, Ronit. Nobody told me. Why didn't you let me know? You disappeared. Wow. Okay- Congratulations. (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) No, no, please. Please. Okay. Come. The Hesped is going to be a big event. You and Esti got married? It was always the three of us. Yeah, you went away. Left the two of us. Well, I would have come over, if you'd told me he was ill. The Rav didn't want you to know. He became very frail at the end. He probably didn't want you to see him like that. You still should have called me. This week has been harsh, Ronit. Hmm? Please? My father just died. I know. I know, I was there. Well, at least you let me know he was dead. It's important that this week is conducted with honor. Honor? It's the most important thing. Of course it is. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (CHANTING IN HEBREW) (CHANTING ENDS) (SIGHS) Sorry, it's a bit of a mess. (CLOSET DOOR OPENING) I'll get you some hangers. (SOFTLY) Thanks. (RONIT SNIFFLES) What? I look older? I wasn't thinking that. Mmm. I look tired. We all do. Esti, do you think I should stay somewhere else? Do what you want. Do the windows open? No. Uh, if you want to smoke you need to go downstairs. Here. I brought you an extra blanket. "Rav Krushka's untimely death "is a crushing blow to Anglo-Jewry. "He was a giant of the faith. "Sadly, he left no children." Lazy journalism. That would have upset the Rav. Childless. It was probably written by some 12-year-old reporter. Forget about it. (NEWSPAPER THUDS) Everybody loves him so much. I used to wonder if I loved him as much as all those strangers did. Sometimes I used to wonder if I loved him at all. Mmm-hmm. You're his daughter. But he was closer to you. He enjoyed teaching me. So, get some sleep, Ronit. Good night. Oh, I brought you, um... (ZIPPER OPENS) I brought this for... Well, for you. It's... Yeah. Oh, it's your pictures. Wonderful. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Pleasure. Good night. So is it good being married to each other? Yes. We're very happy. Good night. (DOOR CLOSES) (WATER RUNNING) (PRAYING IN HEBREW) (PRAYING INDISTINCTLY) You all right? (PRAYING CONTINUES) (SIGHS) That's my dad. Come on, let's go. (SPEAKING HEBREW) Sorry for your loss. You Okay? Yes. Good morning, Mrs. Kuperman! Morning, Rina. How are you? Good, thank you. Good. How was your week? Good. Good morning, girls. Good morning. Good morning, Hannah. At first, as she's never had a class of her own, but no. Good. I've really appreciated the time off. Of course. It's good to have you back, Esti. Oh, thank you. (GIRLS SINGING IN HEBREW) Good morning, girls. GIRLS: Good morning, Mrs. Kuperman. Well, I missed you. Yosef. Rabbi! Morning. Dr. Rigler. Good morning. How is your speech coming along? (CHUCKLES) I'm working on it. It will be a wonderful Hesped. I hope so. The Rav would be very proud of you, Dovid. Appreciate that. Ronit Krushka is staying with you, hmm? Yes, she is. Good day. "A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, "that lies all night between my breasts. "My beloved is to me as a cluster of henna blooms "in the vineyards of Ein-Gedi." ls it about sensuality? That is, the way in which true love manifests itself? But might it also be that between a male and a female that there's something higher than that. But isn't it that the references to sensual pleasures celebrate physical love here? The enjoyment of that love becomes, in this context, the highest. "See, you are fair, my love, "you are fair, "your eyes are doves. "See, you are handsome, my beloved, yea, pleasing, "and our bed is verdant." Could I have a piece of apple strudel? And, um, also, could I get one of these? The Linzer biscuit, yeah. Linzer biscuit? Yeah. Thanks very much. Thank you. (WINDOW SQUEAKING) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (BOTH MOANING) DOVID: Do you have shoes? ESTI: Yeah, okay. Candles... (SIGHS) RONIT: What? ls it wrong? It's only Uncle Hartog. No, and Rabbi and Rebbetzin Goldfarb. (SCOFFS) He still invited me? No, I have invited you. Come on. Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. (EXHALES) Okay. (SPEAKING IN HEBREW) Good Shabbos. Good Shabbos. Good Shabbos. Good Shabbos. (UNCLE HARTOG CHANTING IN HEBREW) DOVID: Amen OTHERS: Amen. (CLEARS THROAT) We understood it the first time, you don't have to explain it. (LAUGHING) She always overexplains a joke. That's the trouble. He never lets it go. Hard to get by with such a Jewish name. Every day he mentions his name. It's unbelievable. UNCLE HARTOG: What kind of a name is "Andy"? He's got nothing else to say about him except his name. What? No, I have something else to say. He's a nebbish. Yeah, that's the other thing. I'm sorry, I love my son. This is his own father talking. Yeah, what do you think? I love him. So our youngest, Basha, just had her second boy. And they named him Daniel, for my father. UNCLE HARTOG: Ah, mazel tov. They live in Australia. It's too far. Melbourne. Thirty-seven grandchildren! UNCLE HARTOG: Mazel tov. Not bad. We saw your photos in a magazine. It was the pictures of the twins that you showed us. REBBETZIN: But they called you Ronnie Curtis? That's my professional name. What was wrong with your real name, Krushka? You should be proud of it. Artists change their names sometimes, don't they, Moshe? That's right, Fruma. Women change their names every day. They take their husband's names and their own history is gone. Don't they? I wouldn't talk about "gone." Not gone. Yes, they do. (CHUCKLES) Ronit, you look so like your mother. RONIT: Oh, don't start! Hasn't she got Leah's eyes, don't you think, Moshe? Yeah, she's got beautiful eyes. Oh, she's a beauty. Uncle... Your dear sister was taken far too soon. (SPEAKING IN HEBREW) RABBI GOLDFARB: And now the Rav. This must be a terrible shock for you, Ronit. You're away, it's a shock. Of course it is. We never thought we'd see you again. Sorry to disappoint you. (CHUCKLES) UNCLE HARTOG: Ronit... More coffee? Oh, no. No thanks. I'd love to talk to you about the house, though, at some point, Uncle. (in HEBREW) Yeah, sorry. Come to the office. We'll talk about it there. All right. FRUMA: You know, you must take your mother's candlesticks, Ronit. From the house. REBBETZIN: Yes, of course, and then you must give them to your children. Oh, I don't want children. I'm not having children. You keep them and then you pass them on. Yes. Yes. l want to sell the house, Uncle. Do you think you can help me to sell it? UNCLE HARTOG: No, please. Not now. I'm gonna need some help, though. Yes, but not... Ronit... RONIT: Sorry. (EXHALES) RABBI GOLDFARB: How old were you, Dovid, when the Rav took you in and taught you? Thirteen, was it? Mmm... Yeah. Twelve, thirteen. Dovid has been doing great work. (ALL MURMUR AGREEMENT) UNCLE HARTOG: Wonderful work. Wonderful work. A lot has changed since you were here. There's a lot of problems. Housing, and jobs... The youth. Even an incident with drugs. (ESTI GASPS) Perhaps people should stop having so many children. It's nothing we cannot deal with. (SPEAKING HEBREW) And you're not married. You must find someone, Ronit. It's not funny growing old alone. Oh, well I'm rarely alone. I've got wonderful friends. I expect you have lots of fun. But that will pass. (UNCLE HARTOG CHUCKLES) But being married, well, that's the way it should be. Oh, is it? The way it should be? Or is it just institutional obligation? Now, Ronit, stop right there. I mean, Uncle, let's just say I stayed here for one more year. Let's think about this, okay, right? I would be married off to whoever and then, after ten years in some loveless marriage I might have ended up killing myself. Or I would've felt like killing myself. (SIGHS HEAVILY) lam really jetlagged, so I think I should... I'm gonna hit the road. And, I'll see you both back at the house. It was great to see you, Rabbi, Rebbetzin, Fruma. Happy Shabbos, darling. Uncle, thank you for dinner. I'll see you guys... Why don't you walk her home, and I'll catch up. Okay. DOVID: Sorry. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Thank you, it was delicious. Good Shabbos. OTHERS: Good Shabbos. Ronit. Hmm. Why is Rebbetzin Goldfarb so mean? She has a good life. What does she want? Mmm. What does anybody want? What do you really want? Do you know what you really want? Yes, I do. I do know. I want my dad to know that I loved him. Do you think he knew that? Yes, yes, he did. He had to know. I'm so sorry, so sorry, Ronit. (CHUCKLES) The Rav... You've lost your father. It goes well, actually. It's lovely, yeah. I don't normally wear such a bright color. It's really good. It goes with the tempo. lt looks beautiful. So if you want to just... You can just... (KNOCK AT DOOR) He's ready for you now. Thanks. Um, the wig... Uh, Ronit, hello. Hello. Let's go upstairs, shall we? Okay. Come in. Have a seat, please. (RONIT CLEARS THROAT) Ronit... I've gone frum! Please don't joke. Hmm? So... (KEYS JINGLING) These are the keys for you to gather any personal possessions. A lot of keys. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. Would you help me sell it? Clause three. "Last will and testament of Rav Shlomo Krushka." Rav Krushka, bless his memory, left the house and everything in it to the synagogue. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry if that's a shock. No. It's just a house. A father should have a child to look after him in his final hours. I didn't know that he was ill. How could you know when you're not here? (THUMPS DESK) (SIGHS) You were all he had left. (SOFTLY) I know. It must be very painful for you not to receive the Rav's forgiveness. SHMULI: Hello, Mrs. Kuperman! Hello, Shmuli! Hello. Rivkah, hi. Hello,Esti. You look great. Oh, thank you! (CHUCKLES) ls everyone okay? Yeah, we're good. We're good! Good, good. And, and, all the help, Esti, it was very appreciated. Of course. Hi, Shayna. Hi! Oh, so sweet. I saw Ronit just now. Oh... Where? She was just walking down the street. (CHUCKLES) She hasn't changed, has she? No... She hasn't. (SHAYNA CRYING) Oh, okay. See you later. Bye,bye. Bye. SHMULI: Bye, Mrs. Kuperman. RIVKAH: There, there. There, there. Ronit? Uh... You're wearing a wig. No. (KEYS JINGLING) Here. Here, let me. (GRUNTS) There you go. (SOFTLY) Thank you. (DOOR CLOSES) (BLINDS RATTLING) ESTI: I'm sorry it's such a mess. I... Your uncle said he was taking care of everything, and... He didn't want us to touch anything before they take it away. Hmm. (RONIT SIGHS) (HEBREW COMING OVER RADIO) (STATIC AS STATIONS CHANGE) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) He left it all to the synagogue. Mmm-hmm. Would you really want it? Financial freedom? No. That would be far too easy. Would've been nice, though, if he'd just mentioned me in his will. Left me a pipe. (BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY) I know. (BOTH HUMMING ALONG TO SONG) (MUSIC STOPS) I'm not gonna go to the Hesped. What? There's no point in my being here. I'm gonna change my ticket. But... (SNIFFING) Mmm. You know, what really gets me is I never took his portrait. So, all he did all day, was stay in here and read the Torah and the commentaries on the Torah and the notes on the commentaries and the debates on the notes. Mmm. And it meant we could do what we wanted. Esti, do you think I should go back early? (SIGHS) No. No, I don't think you should leave at all. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh... Ronit... Esti... When I saw you... Me too. (WHIMPERS) (BOTH MOANING) Esti, Esti, Esti... Oh, no. (GASPS) (EXHALES SHARPLY) I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's... It's okay. (SOFTLY) I'm really sorry. It's fine. I... You do look like your mother. (GROANS) on... Ronit, are you okay? (SIGHS) (EXHALES SHAKILY) (MOANS) (BOTH MOAN) It was me who rang the shul in New York to let you know. I'm just gonna get some air. Why did you get married, Esti? Why didn't you just leave? (SIGHS) Do you remember what the Rav used to say about marriage? You do. No. "Will you grow old alone?" No, no. "Will you grow old with no family, no joys?" (LAUGHS) "Dovid is a good boy. He... "He has a generous heart, and he's crazy about you. Marry him." So everything was all right when I left? No. I was ill. What sort of ill? In my head. The Rav was afraid for me, and if I had to sleep with a man, why not with our best friend? Oh, Esti... I think, I think he felt that marriage would cure me. It hasn't been a complete disaster. And that's enough? Do you have to have sex every Friday? It's expected. It's medieval. It's not mandatory. Nobody gets beaten if they don't feel like it. What happened to you? Nothing. You happened to me. And then I started teaching and that became important. You can teach anywhere. (SIGHS) I really love the girls. And I give them ambition. To do what? Push out seven babies and be a good wife? Don't. Don't. I'm a good teacher. And I help them to value themselves. Okay, but what about you? That is me. Huh. What? (SIGHS) Do you want a cigarette? (LIGHTER STRIKES) No. And you? Are you happy? Yes, lam. Have you been with other women? No. Not really. Mmm. And you? (CLICKS TONGUE) No. But, Esti... Do you still only fancy women? Mmm-hmm. (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) Your bag is, um... What? It's extremely erotic. (BOTH LAUGHING) Can I take it for a spin? Mmm-mmm. No. You're not frum. You don't get one. Oh, please. A quick spin. Come on. No. Please. Fine. Have a turn. One sexy bag, baby. (LAUGHS) What about children? I have three in the bag. All redheads. I think it suits me. RONIT: This is where you first kissed me. (SOFTLY) It's insane that you're here. (BOTH MOANING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) Oh, fuck! (GATE OPENING) HINDA: Ronit? I sthat you? RONIT: Yes. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just having a wander around the old places. This is my husband, Lev. This is Ronit, the Rav's daughter. Remember? I told you all about her. How's it going, Lev? Hi. I hear that you're attending the Hesped. The Rav was a truly great man. Oh, yes, I know, I'm his daughter. Would you like a cigarette? Was that Rebbetzin Kuperman? No. (PANTING) (WATER RUNNING) (LOW WHIMPERING) (GROANS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) DOVID: Esti! Are you all right? ESTI: Uh, yes. I'm fine. DOVID: Esti... ESTI: I'll be out in a minute. What's happened? What? What's happened? SARA: "'Tis true. There's magic in the web of it. "A sibyl, that had number'd in the world "The sun to course 200 compasses, "In her prophetic fury sew'd the work. "The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk, "And it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful "Conserv'd of maidens' hearts." Very good, Sara. So what stands out for you in the play so far? GIRL: The handkerchief. With the strawberries on it. Mmm-hmm. And why is that significant? Anyone? Do you remember what Othello says about how it was made? Yes, Rina. He says that the red of it was dye from virgins' blood. That's right. That's right. Yes? And the lies. Iago just lies more and more. And you don't know why. Mmm. RINA: And the killing, Mrs. Kuperman. That was horrible. It was. Her death is very shocking. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) I'm sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Kuperman. It's all right. Mrs. Shapiro needs to see you. Uh, thank you. I'll go in the break. Immediately, she said. Keep reading the scenes in pairs, girls. I'll be right back. Thank you. Good morning, girls. STUDENTS: Good morning, Miss Scheinberg. MISS SCHEINBERG: Carry on reading where you left off. Come in, Esti. ESTI: Mrs. Shapiro... Have a seat. (MOUTHING) MAN: We would all be very happy if you chose to take on the Rav's work. There are always obstacles, of course, to anything that is challenging. It would be difficult to measure up to the Rav in any meaningful way. And your wife. She would welcome it if you took over the shul? Yes. Esti will support me with whatever decision I make. And Ronit Krushka? We were surprised at her presence. Ronit is grieving. And we will make her very welcome at the Hesped. Of course. And Esti? She won't be distracted by Ronit's return? Why should she be? This is my house we're talking about. I keep it in order. Good. Hello. Esti? What's happened? Are you all right? (SOFTLY) Not here. Yesterday, I behaved like an adolescent. So stupid and so senseless. Did someone say something? Yes! Yes! And I live here. Tell me, what did they say? The headmistress, she... (SIGHS) It doesn't matter. I... We need to stop this. Okay. Okay- Okay. I can't do this. I can't. Okay- We try here. We try to lead a good life. I know. I know. And I do believe profoundly. The word of Hashem is my life. I am... I'm going to leave tomorrow. (EXHALES SHARPLY) (WHISPERS) I don't want you to go. I don't want that. Esti, I didn't know anything like this was going to happen. I really didn't. I... I didn't even know that I was going to see you for sure. Can we just go somewhere else? Can we just get out of here? Please, come on. Come on. We need to just go somewhere else. (SOFTLY) Come here. (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) (MOANS) (BOTH MOANING) (MOANING) (MOANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GASPING) I used to think about your life in New York. Mmm. I tried to imagine your room. I kept track of the time difference. So I knew when you were awake and when you were asleep. What? (SIGHS) I was just thinking of the Rav walking in on us. Oh, don't. His face. (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) What did he say? BOTH: "Hashem, strike me dead!" Oh, no! It was awful. (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES) I want to take your picture. (LAUGHS) For the Jewish Messenger? No. No. Look at me. (GRUNTS) Esti, look at me. (GROANS AND SIGHS) (SHUTTER CLICKS) (INHALES ON CIGARETTE) (CIGARETTE SIZZLING) (SHUTTER CLICKING) Esti? Sorry I'm so late. Did you eat something? Don't... (RETCHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) DOVID: Mrs. Shapiro made a formal complaint about you and Ronit. ESTI: What? She came to you? Yes. Tell me the truth. I, uh... I kissed Ronit. You kissed her? (WHISPERS) I'm sorry. Esti! What are you doing to us? I've tried!! I have! What do you want? I've tried!! What do you want? You want to be hurt again? Has Ronit asked you to go back with her? Oh, Dovid! She'll go back to her friends. Her men. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? I mean, what is it? Just tell me. You can tell me. Can I? Can I? Yes. We've always been honest with each other. Have we? We have. Yes. Have we? I got the message to Ronit about her father. I wanted her to come back. Yes. Yes, I did. No, you didn't. She's taking advantage of you. Look at me. You can't even see it, you're blind. No, no one's taking advantage. You're blind! No! Look at me! I wanted it to happen. And when we were girls... Even then, it was the same. It's always been this way! (SOBS) I have always wanted it. (SNIFFLES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (CRYING) I think you should leave him. ESTI: Really? And where would I go? I'm late for school. Rabbi... Fruma. Elliot. The Rav would be so happy to know that you came. I'm so glad we could come. (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) Joey, thank you for coming from so far. (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) Rabbi, I wish you long life. Thank you. Rabbi. Thank you for being here. The Rav will be immensely missed. Thank you. (MAN SINGING IN HEBREW) (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) We're very sorry. Thank you for coming. Very sorry.

It's good. Very good. Hmm. I booked a flight. I'll be leaving tonight. What? Oh. That's good. That's good. I hope the Hesped goes well. DOVID: NOW it Will. What about you? What? DOVID: What will you be doing? Uh, I don't know. Try. Try to explain it to me. (STAMMERS) I can't. Oh, I should pack. (SOFTLY) Goodbye. It's easier to leave, isn't it? No, it isn't. Are you free? (GRUNTS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CLEARS THROAT) (COUGHS) (MUTTERING UNDER BREATH) (CRYING) (CLATTERING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. Hello? Dovid? No. No, she's not with me. When did you last see her? Well, she'll be back, Dovid, don't worry. Excuse me? Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, Dovid, can I call you back when I've gone through security? Hello. WOMAN: Hello, where are you flying to today? New York. (TYPING) (KEYS JINGLING) Esti! Esti. Esti! Hmm. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR CLOSES) Esti? I wish she'd never contacted you. Well, I'm glad that she did the right thing. My father died. You weren't even going to let me know. Can you see why I didn't? I was protecting my wife. Dovid... (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I want you to give me my freedom. Esti, come here. I was terrified. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to worry. I'm pregnant. (CHUCKLES) (SOFTLY) A child. Hashem is looking over us. I don't think we should be together anymore. DOVID: It's His wish. ESTI: No. I was born into this community. I had no choice. I want my child to be free to decide. We've waited so long for this. Please give me my freedom. No,no,no“. RONIT: Dovid, you can't... Stay out of it. I can't. I'm sorry. You came back. Esti. Fruma. I don't want to upset anyone. I just need to honor my father. I know. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Please. (CLEARS THROAT) (EXHALES NERVOUSLY) (MAN SINGING IN HEBREW) (SINGING CONTINUES) (SINGING STOPS) CONGREGATION: Amen. Why don't you come to New York? Why don't you just come to New York and be with me? (FOOTSTEPS THUDDING) Rav Krushka's departure leaves us facing a void, bewildered. Today, we take comfort in knowing that his legacy will be preserved and carried through to the next generation. I call upon a new voice, Rav Krushka's closest disciple, spiritual son and successor, Rabbi Dovid Kuperman. Rabbi Kuperman. (CLEARS THROAT) Rav Krushka often spoke about the duty of the teacher. The duty... I'm sorry, I can't... The Rav's only child, Ronit Krushka, is here with us today. The Rav's final words to us... Why did he choose to discuss the idea of choice? And freedom. There's nothing so tender or truthful as the true feeling of being free. Hmm? Free to choose. The Rav was a giant of Torah. But it wasn't a giant we saw collapse that day. It was a man. He talked of the angels and of the desires of the beasts. And with his final words, he reminded us of this. We are free to choose! (GROANS) (SIGHS) You are free. You are free!
