Convective clouds affecting southeastern Tibetan plateau are stronger than anticipated. They are moving southward in the southwest region and intensifying. Between seven and nine o'clock, these clouds will affect planes passing through the area. Pay close attention to flights to and from Tibet. Be prepared for delays and cancellations. Notify air traffic controllers that there are critical weather conditions in the region. Copy. Hair and makeup check. Fingernails. Sync watches. Good. We will fly from Chongqing to lhasa today. What is special about this route? It's a high-altitude route since the elevation of lhasa airport is higher than 2,438 meters. What do we do in case we encounter cabin depressurization? Put on oxygen masks and strap ourselves down. How long does the oxygen supply last? Fifty-five minutes. And the critical point? Chongzhou to lhasa cabin pressurization flight profile pargu. Check procedures for cabin depressurization. Flying over the Tibetan plateau is atypical. In case of an emergency, we need to first protect ourselves, but also care for the passengers. If they are nervous, what do we say to calm them down? Please trust us. We are trained professionals. We are confident that we can ensure your safety. What day is this on your rotation, captain? First day. This is my third. I'll fly outbound and you can fly the return trip. Okay. That's a rather large cloud formation. We will fly above it on our way there and on our return flight, it should be gone. Did you notice anything different today? It's your first day in business class. Yawen, I heard you're getting married? Congratulations. Please trust us. We are trained professionals. How many times have we rehearsed that? We've never had to use it. Better if we never have to.

Out of 30,000 employees, why are the nine of us grouped for this flight? Why? We were assigned by dispatch. Of all the combinations, why this one? Do you mean to say that we were destined to meet? Of course I've wanted to meet all of you too. I think we subconsciously desire to meet each other. So, here we are. So lame. Ignore him. I remember you. You left a deep impression on me. You were the one who puked outside the simulator. Nan. Good morning! Are you flying today too? I heard you are here, so I came by. We kept missing each other. Surely you are here to see me. I'm here to see nan, not you. If he asks strangers for their phone numbers, don't stop him. When did I ever ask for phone numbers? Strangers ask for mine! I'm really low-key. Did I ask for your numbers? - Yes, you did! - Yes, you did! I love you! See you on the radar. Have an egg. Well, it's time. Let's go. Please wait for the explosives check. You may go in now. Yes.

One day, you might be their pilot. I don't want to have to worry on that day." I remember you had good grades at the academy. They were all right. Good grades alone don't make a good pilot.
