But it was like something printed, even for television was like something printed on the move I wanted to make theater - Is not it wonderful? So I left and went to DDB Jack Tinker & Partners and I stay there for a while and while I was there I tried my clients do great things, they were very dramatic Anyone who has been someone great in ads, at least in the creative usually has those two qualities: are vendors and entertainment, all in one and she had a perfect It was a time when all the planes came from the army not thinking about food, not thinking about the service, when you were there, was what could be more monotonous than everyone seemed as army officers But the campaign of the new Braniff was on my shoulders and we had lots of fine papers with ideas, piles and piles and piles and hated all And she goes down to the room and for the fifteenth time and look in the trash, along with my desktop and see this fine crumpled piece of paper and pulls on it, looks and says, 'What is this?' 'It occurs to us that every day,' I said, 'But we throw it, it's too obvious' And she said: "Obviously? Is divine!" He said, "Do that!"

One of the hostesses of Braniff International you'll find the plane wear something like this We had a stunning hostess of that to which they thought well, young, beautiful and with beautiful legs and made fun of flying People flying with us, it was a theatrical experience It was a time when people worshiped the marketing understood it, it went well with each other The world had gone wrong in the war, depression, and people loved the fun ideas Life was suddenly ... jovial -Turn left I can not, is looking at me 'OK, turn left - We do not! "No matter how badly you treat a Rebel damage is very difficult " - How am I doing? - Much better than yesterday! They needed a series of dramas, like a sitcom or so I loved that extra effort, the fun, the drama that gave them - Beware of the truck! - What truck? - Behind the bus! - What bus? "The Rebel has survived some of the worst drivers in the world" - Should I turn on the wipers? "It appears that the Rebel will take unexpected detours" It starts at 4 o'clock in the morning In my first job was between 5 and 5:30 In 70, the average citizen received about 1,000 daily advertising messages Today they are near the 5,000 If conditions are right and everything is ready, it takes about 13 minutes A fierce seller, thank you very much, I loved If you can find that kernel the essence of what the product is so if you speak of it no matter how you do it, people will respond and say, "Yes, it is true"; But if you talk about it in an intense and memorable say "Yes, indeed: I'll buy it" It is a challenge to say the right thing, the right way to get someone to do what you want me to do And you have, and certainly have an effect on many people If you want to move someone to do something, you have to connect to it you can not throw in the face, with an explanation, or a joke about it, have to reach them in some way I worked for Clairol hair dye I sold them the idea of ??showing youth with the slogan: "He lets me be myself" It has to do with people connecting with each other I guess he got the message "Hey, someone give me recognition" Bruce Gelb was president of Clairol came with a friend and said: 'I want you to know the woman who invented the 'me generation' Bruce, I said no you're wrong The 'me generation' was there, I realized and I have mentioned, and I showed the evidence for this In New York the worst employees, sent off branches taking the worst of their creative and did creative director at San Francisco When I walked into the office, there were many heroes in the creative So creativity was not a word that was used both The publicist was all, the movies you saw in the gray suit While they were nobody's creative Footmen were like they had in the agency accounts and was the uncle important So I thought I wanted to be the account guys because they were important, if wanted to be an advertiser, you had to be accountable and wear a suit, tie, one of those funny hats, things like ... ... That is what people did then I tried for 6 months, and was the worst job I ever had In the end I did a campaign in the late 60's, for a bank It was an old bank, with its old customers that they either were or dying, or about to do and tried to replace these people for younger customers I decided that there was nothing to talk about so I went to the bank president and said: 'You know, I think with the money to call and write a song composers on young people and their lives, and how they are changing, things like ... And I can not tell what song it is, I'm not a composer, and I can not say what will be the announcement, I can not until we have the song ' He said, 'That ... all sounds very vague ' Only just started ... to live ... ... White lace and promises ... a kiss for good luck and the way we only just begun ... before sunrise ... We got Paul Williams We wrote the song "We just started," which was number 1 or 2 throughout the country So not only get a 'hit' national also made some announcements pretty remarkable for the time it said nothing saved, "You have a long way to go. I want to help you get there", that's all. All we did was to reflect the lives of people and make it so that you 'play' the audience They came in droves to the bank to borrow money and stuff Then the bank decided that they do not want, because they brought money would not give them money, they had no guarantees, and finally decided to load the campaign and get rid of it but meanwhile, what they did with the campaign was who managed to extend to banks across the country And the beginning of care received what was happening in San Francisco something that finally happened. The average American watches over 8 hours of TV a day There are 1353 HD satellite channels throughout the world today, this figure will grow by 350% by 2013 There are 565 channels of satellite TV in the U.S. 70% of households have 3 or more televisions I grew up 'surfing' since I was 12 years I went to the army guys from New York who had completed college and already in a career Missed an opportunity in his youth to rebel when they were in their physical strength, sexual and the ability to connect with life I'll be happy until the day I die, having grown up on the beaches of California I'm Lee Clow and offices are in Los Angeles of TWDA Chiat Day I am president of global operations and head of dep. creative I was adopted and raised by working parents of lower middle class who cared to continue cheering, "Go to art classes, I have told you go" I drew a boat, with smoke rising in the correct direction of the fireplace So I always had in mind, that my art could be my way of earning a living I walked into the office in an agency that represents everything bad about the advertising business an unscrupulous boss, he did do anything to keep a customer did whatever it took to get a client and basically despised all the creative department With him was: "How big you want the logos, Lord?" All they were concerned, was milking customers and give them what they wanted that bad formula, which composes the brunt of the work of our industry And it almost seemed dishonest, let customers dictate a mediocre job and pay us for it, when we aspired to do better I was the head of the 'escape committee', because he said: "We can not stay here!" It is a place of evil, we must go to agencies that created it right! And I was fortunate to discover Chiat Day, who had been born Jay Chiat and Guy Day were rebellious spirit of the pirate I was trying to promote, not this other agency "lela" By the time I left, they said, 'Do not let him re-enter' realized it was an insidious cancer for the company because he preached rebellion creatives 'Rebelaos' 'They can not do shit, if we do the ads for them: You know, 'We should be in charge!' California white wine and real fruit mixed in bowl ... at a party ... ... On the beach ... And now comes the original mix in a bottle "California Cooler, the real ' That's a beautiful sound! I love this city, or not get me out of it I grew up actually in the West Bronx deep in a strict Irish Catholic vecinario Wilder quarter of all fistfights were 15, with 15 kids that ended up being my best friends but you had to fight your way, you know? Because I am Greek I always had this reputation of being tough with customers and had been hard with customers, I had this great idea, it is taught, and struggled to sell and was trying to become rich I had to drag them to become rich, going insane You can thrill to sell a new type of pen, 'Wow, look at the pen, which pen-holders, what sensible let me sell this bitch, go feather, you know, it does work of art You know, you could be excited about nearly anything Watch the ads Maypo all use the command, and changed by pressing, and when you change, you see a scene after another, command and pressing the son of a bitch, and there is Mickey Mantle with a bat "I want my Maypo!" Johnny Unitas - "I want my Maypo!" And press the knob, just in: "I want my MTV!" MTV I can get you to accept it, all cable TV operators even if they were a year shitting on them "Call your cable company and say, 'I want my MTV'" They had no protectors with cable TVs when I told Bob Pittman: 'I'll get rock stars, you know, and if we do it my way, get thousands of rock fans, going crazy with calls to the cable operators' He said, 'You can not get stars, we all hate' "The game will be getting rock stars' And then went to see Mick Jagger and got: "I want my MTV!" They placed the ad in San Francisco on a Thursday night at 8:30 in New York, which is 5:30 in San Francisco And the cable operator calls Bob Pittman there he gets the private line and says 'Do they remove that fucking TV ad " Bob Pittman said, "take it off right away" And San Francisco's uncle said, "By the way, I'll take it" - Do you get what? -The MTV - Why? -Because I've had thousands of calls It's done! In three seconds! - I want my Maypo! I have ... I have you I by the balls! I have the ad! That is advertising, baby I can make a significant mark Hillfiger Tommy and famous and in a couple of hours, you know He is a visionary, seeing things that normal people do not see And think they'll want to see before they know what they want Just launch the launch of MTV ads And this advertising campaign developed to present an unknown brand the world of fashion, from morning to night ... And did He said, 'I have an idea, why not put photos of Ralph Lauren which is a white-haired old guy, Calvin Klein, it seems a little wrinkled, Holstein and maybe he's dead ... And then we say that you're next ' I said, 'You can not compare to Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein I can not compare myself, or so it sounds cool I see myself looking at them, as gods -I showed him the sign that says: "The 4 major American designers are men's clothing" And then C, and such ... Fill in the names ... Calvin Klein ... Ralph Lauren Perry Ellis ... Then T_ H_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Who knew who T.H.? Tommy's mother " 'I do not want to participate in any of this " "Of course, he saw that he could be penalized, said he could not do it" He sat with me and said, 'Listen: if you want a name you recognize something in this office need to spend millions of dollars in advertising over and over and over again and will take years ... If you want your name out there right now, and that people look for your clothes only need something like this ... ' -I always hear the term "seemingly scandalous" and if I look at something and think it is crazy, 2,3,4 in the following seconds or 20 seconds you realize what you bet, but it is better that the product is good, because if the product is not good, I will bring to ruin Because people will want to buy it and find that it sucks -I do not sleep nights because I thought this would be the end of my career And now and then I thought, 'but ... maybe you know my name, people look at the clothes and they like '. They placed the ad, and the crowd went crazy All Seventh Avenue said, "who is believed to be ' ''...' Is not a designer Ralph and Calvin have worked years and years' It was below Cousin Johnny, and the next week he was here I said, 'There is a campaign that I have dreamed, is a campaign that pictured Mr. George Louis and convinced my partners, who must implement it It was not my decision to make this campaign I am struggling as a designer, I want the best for my company and my clothes but I really am ashamed of it ' We made a giant billboard that put the same words on Seventh Avenue to annoy Calvin ... And became famous overnight, literally But I also brought such shame I rolled up and worked as hard as I could never imagine I knew there was only one way to demonstrate what they said was not true and designing clothes was amazing So I literally rolled up, and worked as an animal Making sure that each button, zipper, keypad, color, fit, fabric was a perfect George gave him the "turbo" to my success, then took off all ... began the the "hip-hp", then the rockers, then urban fashion, then the parents and kids My business grew into multi-billionaires and global Good advertising makes food taste better, makes the car run better, change the perception of all In the case of "I Love New York" the most extraordinary thing was the music The music came about two weeks to change advertising And since the music came, New York changed "Broadway is only one: it is in New York" I think what you are manufacturing a feeling, you want You can create any feeling that people want it to have "Especially at night" There are people who can play the piano, or singing I was born, like other people from advertising, with the gift of what they feel will make you feel 'on' -I can not believe I ate that whole whoooole 'I ate, Ralph Food companies spent 32,000 million dollars on advertising last year The car spent more than 15,000 million Advertisement of political campaigns: more than 2,600 million (in 2008) This one here is my mantra, see? "Simplicity brutal" I have asked people to please simplify your ideas He changed it to "brutally simple" one day ... I'm not a rebel, I let go a lot Does this table here? When school is designed Every cut here is the art school And it is with me ever since I've never changed my life table It was a very good student, but his insights It's like being the child [the story], he saw the naked Emperor I saw things, but do not know what to do with them I learned at the School of Art in New York, and saw the ugliness, and knew it was ugly, and I wanted to cure it, and it is a curse, because when you see these things, you see nothing more -I do not feel much stress, I'm a bit unconscious, what makes it good at this, you know? Rich guy is totally stressed Rich is like a power cord Well, I'm still showing my father that I'm good [something] We think that is the key to everything ... -I am the son of an uncle, who went to Wharton Business School and a woman who is a painter and was born in Italy And I think that is perfect for advertising as if he had asked for it -If the dog pee, we take And he really liked a lot ... -Jeff can be very different from me, but when we turn to an idea somehow makes 'click', there is a yin-yang, and it works 'Our motto here is:' Art in the service of capitalism ' It comes from my father and my mother 'I wish to tell you we were so ready, we knew where they would go Our goal was to make good publicity for milk in California revive something like this product, which has been with us from the beginning of time Promote it as a generic product, The reason is there is no such thing as milk brands if you ask people what to buy milk brand will tell "The red brick of", or "2%, that's my check" Milk sales fell 4% each year, and each year would ... Everyone gave milk for granted and ended up being, "I put a Gatorade?" If you are Nike, or if you use Apple put new flavors, bottles, packaging, shoes, White put a gallon bottle has not changed since 1993, that's a real challenge -The intention was that people do not run out of milk implying buy some more, and that will be used for nonagricultural They had to make a presentation, and had no title, and asked Jeff what do you want us to put up? And I thought, why not put a question like 'Do you have milk?' And someone corrected him: 'Jeff, that's not right, it should be, do you have enough milk?' - 'Got Milk?' I looked and jam is the phrase ... is bad ... is seedy, is not correct in English And I said, "I like 'Got Milk' is something Molo. It is so short, that is almost nothing, is gone before you say the words - Hahahaha ... it worked! -The great advertising almost always begins with something that is true -There were hundreds of millions of dollars were spent before this to say "milk is good for the body" To say that you ran in a hurry, then Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu And that's not true, not swallow milk after a 100-meter dash I do not think that is good The truth is you cut strawberries, put them in cereals, Then you sit down and 'pests' and do not have much ... 'agg, I need milk', and that's the truth ... that's all He had no idea where would the 'Got Milk?' 'We could spend all the time and money, to cut all such plagiarisms but that would not sell more milk than But more importantly, we were doing a favor - 'Do you dance?' It's everywhere ... 'Do you' horse '? It is also very sexual ... 'There's no other communication that draws attention, as an ad Have a time limit to appeal to someone, and you have to do with quality It's like haiku Since that announcement about Aaron Burr Got Milk Each plane is working to get something "And now, let this surprise call with the question today of the $ 10,000-a difficult- Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel? Well, let phones and see who is out there ... - '?Hoda?' 'Hello, $ 10,000 who fired ...? - 'Abanbuu' - Excuse me? - 'Abanbuu' 'I fear that time is running out - 'Abanbuu!' I'm sorry, maybe next time - 'Abanbuu' I think we try to entertain the society using the products, I think ... And if a customer comes and hears him, 'you're not thinking about my product?' Of course, but I think we are here every day to do something ... ... And especially to connect with society some form of entertainment 'I always tell people, which is the same as creating art I think things, and they set before the people, he changed with a little luck, enriches them makes them feel something and is a 'high' if it happens to hundreds of millions of people at once Always differentiate between the things you experience as a person or individual and you go and say, 'Wow, how cool' and you tell your friends; and live as individual things, but you know that millions are living the while ... It is a 'happening' community mass and there is so much to offer you that in life. Last year, Time Warner revenues of 8,800 million for advertising A 30-second spot on "American Idol" costs $ 750,000 The value of Michael Jordan for Nike, is estimated at 5,200 million dollars My name is David Kennedy My ID number is 1944793 U.S. Navy Blood type O, and atheist I'm not an atheist Creative people need that kind of duality feel very safe, in a profound way while they can take risks, and involved a lot at work From what I've tried to worry about is the environment in which people work here let them relax, be themselves, be adventurous Have you seen the nest? Were you up in the nest? This is a room where all our employees meet There are all kinds of activities here someone once said: "Wieden + Kennedy is like high school, but with money" It's pretty much what happens to us But back at 3 am is like Santa's workshop [Claus], you know? Owls do not return home at 5 [pm] ... It's hard work, man ... It is physically tough, mentally tough We have to fight a lot so that people with crazy ideas come to mind Where the hell is Kennedy's office? I think most creative people are so damn insecure, they want to believe they know everything but they know inside that are in trouble from rising in the morning So if you say, "It's like you're supposed to be," sometimes as a release This is the office of David ... ... And everything that has ever played is in this office They are plastic pins and this wall there are 100,000 thumbtacks "Fail harder" It took four days and four nights without stopping, do this The background is made with pins The easy thing would have been to make the lettering with them, and leave the wall blank They chose the hard way This concept is perfectly executed, you know? And I think it should stay here forever It's like Babe Ruth trying to hit a "home run" If you fail, fail, but you should try at least herd with the bat as hard as you I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career I've lost at least 300 games. On 26 occasions, entrusted me with the game-winner ... and failed. I've failed over and over and over again in my lifetime. And that's the reason why I won ... I have not had a failure in my life ... ... Probably had, but I have forgotten Why not learn anything from a failure If you sit down to think about why you failed, you're fucking alive Because you have a business, and you suddenly say "George, be careful" My mother told me to be careful, my father ... everyone told me to be careful ... Your coach, school, in the army they say, watch out ... And when you go in advertising around the world there really tell you be careful, at a meeting they say, "George, be careful" Everyone wanted to load everything we did, just before it Do you know? All were nervous - Where's the beef? They tried to load the "Where's the beef?" Issued the week before on TV The guys said, "Oh, I dunno, maybe give us a good 'pan' to us" -It really is a large loaf pan-A VERY large and large bread-Sponge The test said "no way, under any circumstance emit?is" - Hey, where's the beef ...? I think there is anyone out there back Trained left hemisphere, with an MBA [business] people with a mind trained to process data which basically are the backbone of many companies no creativity, no intuition, no trust, no courage, People think that if esl ice is three inches thick that is too thick just What I'm trying to tell everyone is have the power to do what they're doing Everything should be as ambitious Ally, we got a new account and the first thing we did was to be so damn absorbed by the enterprise it was almost like owning it and then going after the "truth of the product" intense Ideas presented simply Introducing a new company, FedEx ... Need to be in New York on Monday, Tuesday, Allegheny, New York Wednesday, Los Angeles Thursday, New York Friday, okay? ... So you want to work here, why do think you deserve to work here? Lord, I think I'll fit, I have a shrewd mind Excellent, can start on Monday? Conclusions ?, Gill, Bill, Bob, Carl, Fred, Lou, Dork, Aven, Ted? Business is good, to work, thanks for coming to this meeting Pete was on the bench, put him into office in Pittsburgh, Pete, Pete, Pete Pete is perfect for Pittsburgh, I can call Pete would you? In this fast paced world with so much pressure to "do it yesterday" Do not you glad that there is a company that can keep up? "When you absolutely, positively, has to be there the next day" I certainly would face any tyrant, rather than a committee The committees generally do not accept any risk for that you create, so the blame is shared Look at something and say, 'Oh, it's interesting ...' maybe 'Interesting' I will make a final test, if I like ... Many times people think of risk in terms of challenging the conventional and is a form of risk, but I think that is the most important is almost an easy target, you know? I think the real risk is to be willing to be truly authentic The whole trick to this office, is to stop pretending to be an advertising agency and make sure that customer is a customer and sit at the table and say, 'Well, what do we do? How do we move people? ' What we do differently to advertising, we have to convince the customer, the uncle of the company, to "buy" our idea, and after that, show it to the consumer And you have to be able to talk to people who are not like you and convince them to do things that are nothing to them A 30 "during the Super Bowl cost $ 2.7 million We made an announcement famous frogs The Superbowl All over the world to hear: "Bud-wei-serrr" And the next Superbowl, the marketing people told me Bud: "We have not taken anything from frogs, let's kill the campaign" "Kill the campaign," interesting, rather, we should create characters that are charged to the frogs Do you know? And kill the frogs in the Superbowl And everyone thought it was a crazy idea August Busch except third, which is like the autocratic dictator who runs the company was: "It's like a movie. It's fun, I like. I like lizards.'re fun" You could see the marketing plan thus: 'My God' ... they had no choice 'Wow, I'm not an electrician, but it must be dangerous - Mother! - Wow, brilliant! -Franky, in the end, every frog has to "croascar" ... 'That's not funny -Ehhh, I laugh when I'm sad What does that have to do with beer? Just want to take part in it, say 'Did you see that? I get it ' If there is truth in this, not a truth about the product is not true of your relationship with the product when you buy Sounds crazy, but I think what you say is: "I am part of people who understand this humor" "I am part of that group" want to be part of that community, and the beer becomes the badge I mean, it works Brands are like people, something like: "Do you think it is interesting that brand? Will take to the dinner? Is it always the same? Or sometimes funny, sometimes serious? " There is a black and white ad for Harley Davidson years ago Harley's logo tattooed on somebody's arm, and basically said: 'When was the last time you felt a passion for something as well?' It's crazy, you can feel how passionate people for brands As if the marks were interesting people, fascinating, intellectual, to which assigned a place of who you are The interesting thing about branding is that you give an idea, not only the consumer but also the company itself, who is she and a sense, you know? And a sense of role and responsibility in the great economy That's almost like being a midwife for [born] something amazing I think we have higher aspirations for our customers and more passion about what they can, should, or should try to be than have them We try to say, 'Hey, you can be more than a car company can be more than a pet food company can hope to give love to the dogs, instead of just giving them food Throw a shot, but it will become, never do But if you save it as it comes, you can edit it, and pretend that the methodology There you go! Now put them together with the first part and ready I think any competitive person motivation to have something to prove does not matter whether your father, or a Jay Chiat but if you want to convey passion for the job I think you almost have, to attack a rebel as well as rather than, more organized And I think that rebellious spirit, to be the David against Goliath, as Chiat / TWDA against big agencies in New York, or customers are small against the big Is not it more fun, be small given the big kick? Maybe it's because I could not kicking ass in high school to anyone I saw that one way in the trade, to use my creativity as jiu-jitsu, in terms of power and win the big storm This is the original equipment from Apple, which launched the Macintosh Each year in the Superbowl, someone calls to talk about 1984 people try to explain why it was a major milestone: Some point to the fact that the product does not teach large audience or the Superbowl, because nobody had done anything so dramatic others point to the fact that once we issue only But I really think it's one of those ... everything happened just as it should Number 1: We were presented something that was revolutionary The Macintosh GUI and mouse, changed everything How often in the history of advertising, you can really tell people that there is something great available? And you can buy Number 2: We had a client who believed in that would change the world, and he said: 'Make me an ad that looks like nothing you've done so far' 3: what happened in England with directors, had become film directors were defining a genre of advertising, which had not reached the United States And when frightened Board said: 'This is stupid, the company depends on this computer, what are you going to spendest that money on an advertisement or taught?' Before the Superbowl, Jobs and Wozniak said, 'I'll pay half if you do the same' "Today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the directives of the Information Purification We have created, for the first time in history, a garden of pure ideology Where each worker flourish away from the plagues of confusing and contradictory truths Our Unification of Thinking is a weapon more powerful than any army or navy on Earth We are a people, a will, a resolution, a cause Our enemies speak until his death, and buried them in his own confusion We prevalerecemos! On January 24th, Apple Computer introduced the Macintosh And you'll see why 1984 will not be like [the novel] "1984" Everything was made to launch the product is now done differently, thanks to that [same] product: film editing, music editing and sound, all TV production tools all the tools we use to produce magazine ads, newspaper inserts And to this day say that all computer companies make their ads on a Mac Dedicated to the mad, the misfits, the rebels that create problems, which do not fit the established mold those who see things differently not like the rules, and do not respect the "status quo" can cit?rseles or disagree with them, glorify or vilification but all is not possible, is to ignore because things change ... move humanity forward and where some might see some crazy, we see genius ... Because those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are those who succeed ... It was all a communicator, indeed, was a very quiet boy, when I came to advertising, I think even more than the 30, did not dare to speak at a meeting and offer my opinion on what was "If Earth were tilted slightly to the left probably would not have happened If the continents would have waited a day or two, start to drift would be to doubt And if the rain had not fallen that day, nor the moon had been full Who knows? Might not have a city called Vergeze or its source, called Perrier My father was a guy who did everything during the Depression and struggled to earn a living, like many people then and was rider, artist, funny, and a good salesman, and all that stuff Still, it was essentially a failure and ultimately led him to 'train' for signing bad checks After that, I did not see much I think that with the problems of my parents, my father was not much ... emotions were a part of my life I always missed, And I think (I'm not "shrink" or I left a lot to them) ... but I suspect that the advertising was as a way to express some things that I experienced in my life I missed many things, those wonderful families who still admire And I think there a lot of that in my work When Americans "buy" the experience Hal Riney when they buy these campaigns, I often buy what they want them to be their lives A feeling of childhood, or something that could be better, if you had that father, the mother, or lived in such house, or in the small town In an era of America that people would want to happen, and perhaps never did But people do not understand, and I think that's how you live as a person Actually, it was where he wanted his life And is recreating it, and is so evocative and sexy, you're feeling it, you are living to this man He drank a little more in those days, and there was a bar on the office, so I used to do much work there and make Bourbon while working And I wrote 3 or 4 ads for the campaign ... in about 2 ? hours, there And a guy asked me 'What are you doing?' 'Well, writing a campaign for re-election of the president, 'and said' Sure, Hal, take another drink ' It's morning again in America Go to work today more men and women who have never in our history with interest rates twice lower than in 1980 Nearly 2,000 families today will buy a new home More than ever in the past four years It is very common it is her voice that creates this feeling and there is a cadence in it that is terribly relaxing but I think after a while, and do not pay attention to exactly what it says but the feeling that creates a warm and serene it was perfect for a guy like Reagan -It is day again in America and under the leadership of President Reagan's most proud of the country, stronger and better Why would we want to go back to where we were, just under four years ago? Never forget the first time I showed the president the spots he was broken, said 'I wish I was that good' Reagan understood the power of emotion and of advertising For him, a campaign [policy] was advertising So, together with the 150 journalists, more skeptical of the world and teach them the ads ... and silence Obviously they had moved the ads A few shook their heads, said it was great, and then other skeptics said, 'We're manipulating the truth' And I said: "Fortunately the people of the country does not look like you" Hal was all move people with emotion, either by Gallo or advertisements for Saturn, which was later in life They are best for policy announcements, and I can testify, I have 40 years in politics There's a bear in the woods For some, the bear is easy to see, others do not see it at all Hal Riney is the devil ... and the angel Riney was that had the responsibility of the poster, that people knew that this was an ad and when you talk to someone while you make it clear that it is in advertising, but that world is gone and, you know? Many of the things that happened in the name of advertising, is now upon us forms seem absurd and otherwise It is not advertising, is anything Everything is an advertisement, a specialist Graffiti on the wall, guerrilla tactics, movies or theater, 'placement' of products and thus, more, more, more ... It's like air and water, is around you, and you happen Always terrified me, Dan Wieden will always tell you exactly what you think Do much advertising is a very emotional, very difficult not for the faint of heart It was unusually exciting, being present at the birth of something like that that looks like a 'bump' in the nerve in the cultural Some things are not as long as you do, you know? Otherwise, you could not make it the right way It was clear that the mission # 1 of Nike athletes was to provide but it was late 80's that the definition of athlete, expanded beyond the sponsored pros Nike is often attributed the boom in the United States jogging because Bill Bowerman, co-founder of 'imported' jogging to America if you can imagine saying that ... He had seen people jogging in Australia or New Zealand or something ... People had started to run really for 'fitness', what had not happened long before that All I wanted to Nike, was to inspire people to participate in sport mission is pretty good for a company Actually, the inspiration came from a man who was about to be executed for murder in Utah and his final words to the firing squad were: 'Let's do it! " And so, I thought that I probably liked the "Do It" That's not the version I heard when I came to Nike sure did not want anyone to know that was the genesis of the phrase None of us paid much attention, thinking, 'Yes, it worked' And I think what happened is, like many things in life, that are sometimes things that go unnoticed, do not really see, people begin to take readings, beyond sport I think they were surprised and delighted but as admit, also completely stunned by the impact it had -I think it's good to apply to life - "Just do it" 'It seems that everyone can do it, you know? 'As he gave me a kick ... you know? It gave me new life with my career - "Just do it", do what you want ... It was the final year of high school, and encouraged me to ask this girl out and get the courage to ask, and it worked ... People will apply to all that put off, leaving for later or to avoid confronting what Women wrote to me saying, 'Finally I dropped the bomb' Getting a divorce based on the slogan "Just do it" I started receiving letters from people with emotional problems, or all subjects in which this phrase, and this way of looking at the world, they found something much more profound than even we were talking, you know? There was a woman, Janet Champ, working in our agency with Charlotte Moore, these creative and began to speak from within their experiences publicly They took that discussion on what it really means to be a woman in today's world and how women are looking for meaning in the world, and strength They put everything all there, it was very personal, I think it was even a picture of Janet's mother, the ad He was speaking at the University of Oregon and said, "Did you notice that women talking about women?" "My God, I plucked, I went to my daughter will be 3 weeks and I said, 'That's what I was trying to tell you'" -If you let me play -If you let me play sports 'I myself more like me I have more self- -If you let me play sports -If you let me play -I have a 16% chance of having less breast cancer -I will suffer less depression -If you let me play sports -Will be less likely to let a man hit me -Will be less likely to get pregnant unintentionally -I will learn ... learn ... learn what it means to be strong ... be strong -If you let me play sports Perhaps the "Just do it" made more healthy people in the world maybe they got up and did: run and play and be healthier but the reason why the campaign was successful is because a nice man emotion, the notion that we can be healthier, was suddenly in sync with a corporate mission and sold a lot of equipment to the people And we like, we like those two things together We do not suspect these things, if they are in the same direction People do not care to sell them things if you understand why he has so, and enjoy the process ... At the same time, you know, I wish you, people to understand that the marks can be dangerous are like a TV channel that you tune your body instantly and if you like it, hear, like a dog waiting for something to happen and attention as dangerous, which can be abused and the greatest abuse is when you treat people like idiots treat them as if they had no sense of humor, or like fools that would be the greatest concern I do not like my children to see bad publicity I'm like everyone else, I think it's bad for them I think I understand why people throw advertising, because a lot of advertising is basurilla They are really trying to do something creative, enlightening and inspiring very low point, something like: 'We want a piece of communication 30 "to tell people these five characteristics of product" That is, as not very ambitious, you can do so much more ... I see many ads on TV and think: there was no one in the room, saying 'not interesting'? Nobody cares about that? Someone would say that, in each room where you decide to adopt an ad Each year, a typical child sees about 20,000 ads on TV I think it's easy to be skeptical of advertising, because we do not monitor us, and do things that people want inside -We deserve the anger part Americans see 61 minutes of ads every day ... on the Internet, TV, and mobile 65% of Americans think they are being "constantly bombarded with too much" advertising My father was in the profession so I thought that advertising was the most horrific profession which could be It was late, away from family, and talked a long time, intimate conversations with people who did not even like and it was so nice to them, almost like a double-sided It was a great man, you know, and I just thought the profession was something to avoid at all costs It's what attracted us to be together that mutual love-hate for the profession, you know, I spent 15 years in Chicago before moving here and hated publicity I used to lie, tell the teachers of the children was a designer do not mind a word on advertising Most advertising is offensive, intrusive infuriating, annoying, and intellectually based on the lowest common denominator so it is a skill that is difficult, still feel proud But I believe that when advertising is done well, the wall or fence revere a brand, with art and beauty, can become part of our culture, rather than one type of pollution There are 17,500 photos for this session this is like the final group, for vertical and there are fifteen dance here and I think there are chosen from top to bottom, that's a ... ... But also what works together ... ... There's more character, and makes everything a little more specific ... ... Hair is always nice ... ... Which is how this series will take ... We brought this Latin dance instructor and said "This rate, now is the samba" and started doing the samba, with different partners showing the different parts of the dance was fun because we brought in plan consultant, and was talking about it, and began to dance and the entire agency was around and we knew it was a very special Do we have taken against green screen? Do we have some pictures of the dance "scat" that we use at first, to find out how it would work? These things just out there in the world, as art You know, if we go back a few centuries ago, in Paris Toulouse-Lautrec was making posters that went through Paris inviting people to the Folies Berg?re Now considered art, and there are many books hardcover art, including works by Toulouse-Lautrec But of that, just trying to get people out to take a drink pay the admission fee and enter the Folies Berg?re So I think we're in the office of art, when we do it right We're on our way, we travel a lot Now, I think I have a trip today ... -Atlanta - Where? Yes, Atlanta ... - What will you do there? I'm not sure I had a great life, a busy life but he had energy, I was born with that energy, is in my genes. I never tire Maybe because I have no fear. I think the fear is a powerful ... sedative This is an office of rejection. They "kill" things all the time Start working, some ideas you yourself loads, teach them to your partner and he / she is charged ideas, Samples are customer ideas and charged and they are taught to the control group and uploaded a couple of ideas and then they teach the client again and decides that he does not like after all, because he saw his wife ... And that can sometimes take a year, the process, you know, you can take a year It is very stressful and depressing to be loaded and ideas so there must be an environment that will strengthen around because people have to get off the ground, and start again This office is not a committee work, not a work of formulas not a job, it is not a job that any of it go It is not the large ones, or else this is just a few really good And if you're lucky enough, as I have been, to have some of those people around you, you can probably succeed, because not many of them, I tell you There are many people in this job, but only a few really good and only a few people who have the opportunity to do a good job The agencies employ over 182.600 people in the U.S.. There are approximately 26,000 advertising agencies worldwide 80% of the advertising produced only four groups of international companies ?I can say anything else? I do not think any organization or career success If there is a lot of that love, old school, involved ... and a deep sense of affection for each other, by the people you work with And what you get ... if you cling to it, and make your choices with that in mind even when you have to make tough decisions ... I think that makes a difference It must be something more than an art hated, has to be bigger than that is the way that large companies without a soul, you really have a personality and interact with people in a way, hopefully, meaningful They often do not have a way of interacting with the world are as large solitary beasts in their caves, you know, and help them get out ... I think artists have a need, to express themselves and tell stories and if you stop capitalist society, and will create a socialist / communist in which there was no need for advertising, because you can only buy one type of soap, or car people would not stop telling stories and things to convince And if you do not say, 'Buy this car, buy this computer' you would say, 'we should overthrow this government', 'we must change things' But there would always be someone with a message ... I've never been afraid of my talent or my ideas, or thoughts or experience, or to learn ... I love new ideas If someone comes up with a better idea than mine ... I love it! For me is the celebration of the beam that [you] hit, someone bumps into something and says 'God!' "I think this is very very important or very 'cool'", you know ... ... And people feel that So if you speak honestly and use this profession to do that, Can go a 'shit' amazing! I believe that creativity can solve everything ... everything ... everything ...!
