Double up now. There you go. That's the way. How's your wind? Good. I'm up to five miles. Add wind sprints. OK. Curious on who you're gonna fight? Doesn't matter. Right. Double up. Black Cloud. Black Cloud. Welcome, folks, to the fourth annual... Hey, Tyler, do you want a snow cone or a cotton candy? How about some popcorn? I don't want him eating all that sugar. Aw, your mom's no fun, is she? That's all right, buddy. I'll take care of you. Can I get him a snow cone and cotton candy? Ride 'em, cowboy. Better bring in our next cowboy. From Gallup, New Mexico, we're talking about Eddie Young. Come on. Do we have any Eddie Young fans out there? Ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you... this cowboy just qualified for the nationals. Outside. Look out, cowboy! But he's OK. Let's give him a big round of applause... for putting on quite a show out there, folks... and he's our winner right now-- Round Number One. -Yeah! -All right. At the end of Round One, it's a tight race, folks. Here's our cattle. You want me to come? I was wondering if you'd stop by. I thought you might like to see your son. He's older than I thought. It's been two years, Eddie. It's been that long, huh? Well, how you been? We're doing fine. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Hey, I qualified for the finals. Yippee. There's my girl. I got a free night. What do you say? Go to hell. Damn, I miss your fire. I don't miss you. You sure about that? Maybe just a little bit? Don't you even want to know his name? What's the point? Tyler, that's your father. This is the last time we'll see him. ls he gonna turn left or right? -Why you asking me? -Because you know. He's gonna fake left and go right hard. Navajo Nation. Outside! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Yaah! Come on! Ha ha! Yeah, yeah, Jimmy! Jimmy White. Even losers get lucky sometimes. Where's Sammie sitting? They don't need you. Heh. And she needs you, huh? She's sweet meat, ain't she? I'm going to forget you said that. No. You need to remember who was there first. Want to settle this? Mine's the red Dodge. Legs in. Let it ride, Eddie. -Come on, now. -Outside! Black Cloud, how's the boxing going? All right. Heard your daddy was laying in the road last night. Sounds like him. Nicely done! His score is 35. Listen... Eddie's just passing through. It's best you stay away from him. Sure. All right. Good ride, son. Eddie Young, pardners! Hem you OK? No, I'm not. Some things you can't change. I'll meet you at the chapter house. What are you doing? I'll catch a ride with Jimmy. Don't worry. All right. Well, look who showed up. If you want that slut, you can have her. I'm done with her. It's time you were taught a lesson. And you're the bad-ass Indian who's going to give me it. Are we talking or fighting? Enough. Enough. Enough. They're all whores, you know, including your mama. You need to learn when to shut up. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Now, our brothers who own casinos... have invited us over for a visit. I suggest that we take them up on their offer... and see what kind of effects it has had on their people... and their land. I say no to casinos. The Navajo can prosper only in righteousness. That's right. You are a wise man, Joseph Ness... but my heart and thinking are different now. Where is it written that being sick, poor. and uneducated... are better for our souls? All right, enough. No more. Go bother your parents. Don't blame me when your teeth fall out. You're mean. You got one for me? The schools, the medicine, the housing... What happened to you? I bumped into a wall. You're not funny. You all right? I'd be better off with a brownie. Have you seen Bud around? Not here. Lucky for you. Does it hurt? A little bit. You're good. You want to be my corner man? Ow! Why do you do this? You're better than Eddie. I know that, but he doesn't. Well, he does now. One day... you have to grow up. Only if they make me. Go home. Get some rest, OK? Hey, Black Cloud, man! Whoo! Give me five, man! My son! Whoo! Here, have a drink, my man. Come on. Come on, join us, man. I wanted to be simple To be silent... Why you disrespecting my friends? Here, have a drink. Party with us. It's time to send your friends home. Oh, I see. The party's over. Black Cloud says the party's over! Come on! Come on! Double up, man! No, we have a good team. Don't worry about it. I got a few holes to fill but we'll fill 'em. I'll fill 'em. No, just a lot of brawlers. No skill. Oh, listen, I got to go. Rocket's here. Yeah. Part of the game I hate, but... Listen, I got to go. -Whoo! -What's up, baby? Knock him out! That's it. Keep your hands up. That's right. Hey, Rocket, it's your favorite Olympic scout. -How you doing? -You know I'm doing good, man. Move around! Jam him, Cloudy! Come on! Whoo! Get your punk ass back in your corner. OK, come on. Your rain man's going down. Oh, yeah? How much you want to go? -Two hundred. -Two hundred. Breathe. Breathe. You can't hurt him unless you throw him. Black Cloud, you can take this guy, man. He's strong. You're strong. Hey, man, what's up with you trying to holler at my man? You know how many kids he got? You're talking about money. I'm talking about the amateurs. There's no money in the amateurs. We're talking about Olympic gold, Rocket. Do you know what it's like when it's mad cold... you ain't got no heat, hmm? At Christmas time, there's nothing under the tree? You know what that's like, Norman? OK, OK, OK. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What about this, OK? I'll get you a car. We'll talk to one of our corporate sponsors. -We'll get you a deal. -You can get it for free? Come on, Rocket. I can bend the rules. I can't break them. You can't break the rules? Rules are meant to be broken. This is the amateurs. And my boxer ain't no amateur. He's a pro. You remember that punk cowboy last weekend? You got him. You got this guy, man, OK? You get out first. Don't wait on him. Stay on your toes. I'm going to go inside on him. Good. Take a deep breath. Get some gas. Again. Right. Remember, stay on your toes. Deep breath. BOX! Know how much more marketable you're gonna be if your face... is on a box of Wheaties after he wins the Olympic gold? Them suburban moms don't want me in their kitchens. They want me in their beds, kid. If they saw a boxer- Who is that kid? That's Rocket's cousin... the number one ranked light heavy. No. I'm talking about the Indian kid. Black Cloud from the Navajo Nation. The kid's got heart. He got more than heart. Overhand fight, Damon. Come on, baby. Yeah, let's go, Damon. That's right. He out of here like last year, baby. Come on, Cloudy! Cloudy! Stop! -Whoo! -One... -Yeah! -Two... Three... Where the hell did you come from? Six... Medic! Somebody calla medic! How long before I'm on again? Two hours. That kid was a good fighter. He almost had me for a second. Oh, man. You can't believe the buzz about you out there. Black Cloud this, Black Cloud that. "Who the hell is Black Cloud?" Nobody knows, but I told them they're going to know... when you walk away with this tournament. All right. but you better cover what you bet... because I ain't got nothing. Don't you worry. I got it covered. Oh, hey, I just ordered this George Foreman grill. Three payments of $19.95. What's the matter with you? You trying to get us kicked out of here? That's low rent, Jimmy. I'm just trying to pay the rent, Bud. All right. all right. but when you don't have gas money... and need a buck for a Coke, you don't come crying to me... because I'll tell you to die of thirst. Then you can ride that mustang around the rez. And I ain't canceling the George Foreman grill. OK. How about you get us burgers? Oh, I see how it is. You want me to be your slave and carry your bag... and get your burgers and not get paid for it? Want some fries? Me and him been friends a long time. Yeah. They're hard to come by. Let me look at you. Yeah. The swelling"; coming down. You don't even know when it happens, do you? What? What happens in the ring? I don't know. I just fight. Crossing over into the spirit world... is a powerful thing. What do you mean? Where you went... Our ancestors called for you and you answered. There was this one voice that rose above the rest. You are chosen. Figure out why they're calling you. Great. I thought only medicine men had to deal with this. Excuse me, guys. I don't want to disturb you. I'm Norm Olsen. I saw you fight today, young man. Black Cloud. Nice to meet you, Black Cloud. How long you been boxing? I've been fighting my whole life. What is it you want, Mr. Olsen? I don't want anything. What's your name? -Bud. -Good to meet you. No, I just--I saw something out there today... that I haven't seen for quite some time. Oh, yeah? What was that? I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. Jimmy. Look, I saw raw talent today... combined with clarity of purpose. And I was just wondering- You know, you got a gift. What you plan on doing with it? What's it to you? I'm just a man who doesn't like to see talent wasted. Oh, I see. Unless I play by your rules, I'm a waste. You ever think of boxing in the Olympics? The question's never been asked. Well, he should. He's incredibly talented. And a man only gets so many highlights in his life... and I guarantee you... you box for your country in the Olympics... it'll be one of them. And your interest? I'm an Olympic boxing scout. Aw, forget it. I ain't interested. Cloudy, let's hear what he has to say, man. No. I ain't interested in what the man has to say. Well, why's that? Because it's lies. It always is. I'm sorry. I'm not following you. It's in their soul. They don't know any better. And why should I fight for your nation... when all you've done is murder and imprison my people, huh? Black Cloud. I didn't invite you here. You're not welcome. Black Cloud, I've done nothing to your people. Look, there's an Olympic trial in Vegas. You should be there. I fight for the Navajo Nation. Fine. Nice meeting you, Bud. See you around, kid. What are you doing? He's the stallion the elders talk about. How did you catch him? He caught me. Come on. I got someplace to show you. I can't just leave the kids. Jackie-'ll Watch them, right? -Sure. -Come on. Always thought that I could be John Wayne Come sunset, I'd sweep you away But I don't feel much like him today... It's magnificent. He's free. How do you find these places? Finding grass for the goats. When there's a drought, you look everywhere. I like to call this place the Valley of the Gods. I think this is where they would visit. Do you ever get scared out here? There's nothing to be scared of. The Winter Wind, maybe That'll kill you... if you're standing around, looking stupid. That's right. I forgot. You're a big, tough brave who's not afraid of anything. There's one thing I'm afraid of. Really? Let me guess... losing a fight to a white boy. Heh. Never gonna happen. The dentist? Never really needed one. What? Losing you. That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever told me. I love you. I love you more. I guess I really need Something I can see Something I can hold Someone to hold me I guess I'm trying to say That you're the only way You're the only one Button your top button. And fix your tie. My tie ain't gonna make a difference. Could you please just try and be nice? I'll go wash behind my ears in case he looks there. Hi. Can I help you? I have a housing appointment with a Mr. Turpin. Your features are too delicate to be a Hopi... and the way you carry yourself- too refined for a Ute. No. No, neither tribe is privileged to call you theirs. You're a Navajo. I'm Turpin. Let's see how I can help you. Come on in. OK. I read in the paper that a housing project... with 600 homes might get funded. Do you have any idea how long that waiting list is? I, uh, I can't see you getting a house for... three to five years. However... if you would like to have lunch... we could explore other options that I'm sure would cut that time down considerably. You are of legal age, correct? Turned twenty-one last winter. That's fantastic. What an exciting time in a woman's life. You're so full of power and freedom over your choices. Would you care for a drink? No, thank you. Are you sure? It's cherry schnapps. Goes down really easy. Oh, you know, I just remembered. There are several homes that are currently unoccupied... because they're being renovated. Do you have an application I could fill out? Sure you wouldn't like a taste? Yeah, what do you want? Are you OK? I'm fine. Mr. Turpin was just telling me our options for a house. Uh, yeah, I'm Ron Turpin. And you are? Black Cloud is my boyfriend. Oh. Well, that's interesting. Look, Why don't the two of you just Wait outside, and I'll-- I'll deal with this after lunch. Boy, how time flies. Things took quite a bit longer... as I had unexpected company for lunch. Mr. Turpin, we've had a long day and we have a long drive home. We'd like to do what we need as far as applying for housing. Oh, sure. I'm sorry I took up so much of your valuable time. But rights to benefits is a black-and-white issue. Or, should I say, a red-and-white issue. Heh. Do you know your bloodline? I know my mother and my father and my grandfather. Yeah, well, that's not surprising. Most of you don't know more than that. But then, lucky for you, it's all recorded. Here's your certificate of Indian blood. Looks good. Now, your C.l.B. is very interesting. Your mother, Victoria Ness-- Who's deceased, correct? was the daughter of Joseph Ness... still alive- and Mary Bahe--deceased, who were the children of Joseph Ness and Elsa Johnson... who were the children of White Wolf and Nanebah. And that's as far back as I need to go... because that's where your trouble lies. White Wolf... also know as Hans Schroeder, born in Hamburg, Germany. I've walked with blue eyes in the dream land. Well, next time you and Gramps go for a hike... maybe you can tell him to keep it in his pants... or you can punch him in those blues eyes... and make 'em black because boy, you are a mixed-blood"... and your name on this application... pushes Miss Haskie to the back of the line. You're a small man. You hide behind your fear. -Excuse me? -Let's go. You took what you had no right to take. Look, I think it's time for you to go. -Listen to your woman. -You stink with fear. Look, I don't have to listen to this. Out! Get out! Before I call the po|i-- They say TO Pity 3/0'-I Turn it off. Are you gonna be OK? I'm gonna be fine. It doesn't matter to me, Black Cloud. It matters to me. Please don't do this. If you don't want to be with me, I'll understand. Listen to me. You gave me hope when I had none. Tyler and I love you very much. You're everything to us. So, please... don't bring it up anymore. Good night. Good morning to you, too. It's been a long time since you stayed a night. It's good. So, how you been? We're just fine. No wolves about today? No wolves for a long time. Last wolf, three toes. You sure there's no white wolf? Somewhere in the darkness? Where's my keys? Where's my keys?! In the bedroom, maybe. Where in the bedroom?! Hey, Mom. Hey, baby. All right. Look at that move. You got the move, baby. Ohh, look at that. Snag. Snagaroo. Ha ha! I can't find my keys. Party's over! Everybody out! I've kicked you out before. You're done messing with Indian women- Hey, bro, she was touchin' me, too. All right, all right! I'm goin'. Hey. boy. BOY Boy. Whose house do you think this is? It's the white man's house. It's not yours. Everything we have isn't ours. What are you saying now? I'm saying you disgust me. You shame our family and you shame our people. What the hell happened to you? I know about White Wolf, and why we're cursed. White Wolf who? Forget it. Where's my keys? You're not getting the keys till you fix my stereo. Come on, you ain't so tough. Come on. This ain't the boxing ring. Just give me my keys! All right. Don't bite the hand that feeds you, huh? You're smart. Not like your mother, who always talked too much. What the hell you doing wearing her ring, anyway? -You show me? -Yeah. Hold it. Can you tell me why there's two sheriff's cars pulling up? What? Get inside. Ya-te-hay, Sheriff. What brings you out here? Well. if I said it was the beautiful scenery... I'd be |yin', wouldn't I? How'd the army treat you? Saw some things. Some good, some bad. You were f|yin' one of those tank killers. What do they call those things? Apache. Isn't that funny? A Navajo f|yin' an Apache. Ya-te-hay, Sheriff. What brings you up here? Well, that's the second time I've been asked that... so I guess I'd better answer. I'm looking for the driver of that truck. Gym room. Go get him, boys. Hold it. No disrespect intended, Sheriff. Why don't we talk out here? Step aside now and let my boys do their job. If they have a job to do, I won't get in their way. Now, why don't you tell me what's going on? You got any firsthand knowledge about this? 'Cause if you don't, we got nothin' to talk about. Please call Lieutenant Yazzie and ask him to come out here. OK, Chief. Now, Bud, Why'd you have to go... and complicate things like that, man? Look, I've got the victim in the hospital... and I've got three witnesses to the attempted murder. Attempted murder? Right. Who's in the hospital? Bud, We're not in the habit of divulging victims' information. Lieutenant Yazzie's already headed this way, honey. What happened, Black Cloud? I taught Eddie Young a lesson. That's bullshit, son. You tried to kill him. He'd be dead if I wanted him dead. ls that a fact? Why don't you get in the car... so we can go downtown and clear this up? Stand still until we talk to Lieutenant Yazzie. You got no power on the rez. You and I both know you can't stay on the rez forever. Say, isn't your sister married to a Young? Yeah. That's my nephew lying in the hospital. Not smart. What are you doing? You know you're supposed to give me a heads-up... when you're on the rez. See? You have no power here. Son, don't be ta|kin' shit you can't back up. Now, get in the car. Shut up. We have an attempted murder, we have a positive ID... and we want Black Cloud for questioning. Black Cloud, get a lawyer... and we'll go in for questioning tomorrow. No deal. We think he's a risk for flight. We want him now, we want him confined... and we don't want him running around the rez. Question him now. Without a lawyer? What do you want to know? Where's the bat you assaulted Eddie with? No bat. Just these. Cliff, this sounds like a fight went wrong. This wasn't just a fight, Bud. My nephew's laying in the hospital... with a pierced lung and he's fightin' for his life. You crossed a line, son. Attempted murder follows you anywhere you go. Now, get in the car! I ain't goin' nowhere! This incident... happened on the rez. Don't pull that shit, Bud... cause it'll come back to bite you. You people don't live in some self-sufficient world out here. Sooner or later, you gotta go into town... cash your check, and pick up a six-pack. I think I've heard enough. I'll look into it. There were witnesses. I'll let you know what I find. All right. You played this one wrong. If that's the way you want it, that's the way you'll get it. I'll be seeing you. Black Cloud... if Eddie dies, there ain't a man in this world... that can protect you, son. That's a promise. Stay out of trouble. What's wrong with you? You've got everything. Why do you want to throw it away? Eddie had a chance. This stops now. Now, here's the deal... you live under my roof... or we can't work together. That ain't gonna work. I come and go as I want. I'll be seeing you. Black Cloud. What's going on? Not much. ls Sammie around? Yeah, she's inside. But let's talk about something out there for a second. So, what's up? A complaint came into the tribal office... from Mr. Turpin at Indian Affairs... while you were gone. Yeah. Me and Sammie went up to Gallup... to apply for rez housing. Mr. Turpin says you assaulted him. He pushed Sammie. Did Eddie--who's lying in the hospital--push Sammie, too? I'm seeing a side of you that I don't like. This doesn't only just affect you. You need to think about Sammie and Tyler's future. I'm sorry, Black Cloud. I really am. Don't feel sorry for me. I'll be all right. Tell Sammie I'll be seeing her. I want you to stay away from Sammie. Don't make this harder than it already is. Hey, Black Cloud. Somebody give him a beer. Give him a beer, man! What are you guys up to tonight? The question is, can you keep it up tonight? Damn, bitch. Are you in heat? I'll go look for him in the kitchen. I'll look over there. Sol hit him over and over. When I finally quit... the whole side of his face was, like, mush. Ha ha! That's awesome, man. Awesome. The best part about beatin' the white... is the shock in their eyes. Deb, what are you doing here? Hey, Jimmy, you want to be my stud? This guy's so lame. Look, when your brother finds out... you're gonna be in trouble. They don't care what I do. Go home. Who invited Black Cloud? I did. And he's staying the night, too. Can't let him drink and drive, you know? Black Cloud. What are you doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? Having a good time. Yeah. Why didn't you call? Since when do I need your permission? Move. What the hell is going on? What do you mean? Since when do you hang out with these losers? This is my tribe. They're not losers. We're the Mixed-blood Clan! Mixed-blood! This is my new family. Black Cloud, you're nothing at all like them. You're special. Why are you doing this? Because it's in my blood, Sammie. My blood is poison. There's nothing I can do about it! I don't care who your great-great-grandfather was. You don't want to be with a mixed-blood... or have mixed-blood kids. Look what happened last time. Last time... I got Tyler. Do you see it bothering me? Don't you get it? This isn't gonna work. We're not gonna work, so get the hell out of here! Here's your beer, Black Cloud. Hi, Sammie. It's been a while. I'm not looking back. Bud, open up! Bud! What gives you the right, huh? To sit up all high? You're just as bad as they are! I thought you weren't coming back. Well, I'm back. So what? Where you been? Partying- What's to celebrate? Custer, that white prick. Heh. I'm ce|ebratin' him. They took it all, Bud! Fuck. You're right. They did. You're gonna let that ruin your life? I'm taking it back. I'm taking it all back! Well, put down your beer and come on in. Bud, I can't remember what my mom looked like. She was pretty, right? She sure was. Yeah, I thought she was pretty. Your mom and my wife were the two everyone was after. And I was lucky I got one. I'm a mixed-blood. Yeah. I know. Sammie. I thought you were dying. Well, I am, without you, baby. Please go away. Hold on, Sammie. Now, I know I haven't treated you right... but I'm here to make it up to you. Eddie, too many things have changed. Can't a guy get a second chance? I mean, to make it right with his--his family? Hey. Taylor, buddy. I'm your daddy. What do you want, Eddie? You don't know how many times... I picked up that phone to call you, but... I just didn't know what to say. But I swear to you, baby... I thought about you all the time. I loved you once. But I don't even recognize you anymore. Well, let's go out and do a little dancin'... a little drinkin'. You'll remember me then. Sammie, you're the only one that's ever done it for me. The last time we went drinking, we made Tyler. He's the last good thing you'll ever do. Look around you, Sammie. This is your future. It's pretty, ain't it? I told you I'd get you. I guess you were right. I can't stay on the rez forever. Had to get my beer. Well, you'll find I'm right about a lot of things. So, are you gonna pull me out and beat the piss out of me? I might. What are you waitin' for? You know, Eddie's ignorant... but he didn't deserve what you did to him. Eddie got the girl. He's all right. Beat me 'cause you Want to. What are you doing? Resisting arrest. Get back in the truck. Make me. What happened to you? I'm who I always was, just another drunk injun. So come on! Open my head! You are drunk. Do you know who you're ta|kin' to? Sure, you're the cowboy. I'm the injun. Come on, John Wayne! Time to take me out! This isn't a movie, son. If I take you down, it's gonna hurt. So hurt me already. Come on! So, you like John Wayne movies? So do I. I remember watching John Wayne and his boys... take out them injuns by the hundreds... makin' it safe for all the wagon trains. Things were a lot simpler then, weren't they? Yeah. Till one day, I'm sittin' in front of the TV... shootin' down injuns with the Duke. Then I stopped 'cause I realized I was one of them. That's the day you started hatin' the white man. That's the day I became ashamed. Son, we're all dealt different hands in life. The sooner you learn to play yours and stop b|uffin'... the quicker you'll find your place. Are you gonna beat me or not? Come on, pussy! Where you goin'? I'm here! Come on! Where you goin'? Go home, Black Cloud. Don't know what it is, but the little girls love it I like it, I love it I want some more of it Hey, Black Cloud! Yo, you going to sit on the couch all night? Come on, man, get up and help us out. Sing us a tune, man. No, I'm fine right here. You have fun. Yeah. Argh! Aah! Yee heel You know, I want you to know... that I forgive you for breaking my stereo. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. In fact, I want to thank you... cause if you hadn't, I Wouldn't have gotten that beauty. I'm ho|din' umbrellas and openin' up doors I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' the floors Dad, do you remember what Mom looks like? I'm like this cause I like it I love it, I want some more of it I try Come on. You're dropping your hands. I can land those all day. So, you're a mixed blood, huh? Big deal. We're all mixed up some way. Shut up. You and Sammie split up, huh? Where'd you hear that? It's written all over your face. She's better off without me. First smart thing I heard you say. Why's that? First sign of trouble and you run. It's best now she knows what kind of man you are. I said shut your mouth! Shut it for me. See? You can't even put one foot in front of the other. You can't think. You're so full of fear! What are you afraid of? Shut your mouth! I already told you to shut my mouth... and you can't even do that. Your daddy's a drunk, and your mama died... and you're a mixed blood. Poor, poor Black Cloud. What do you know about shit? A lot of people who have it harder than you don't quit. You betrayed your nation. You fought for the whites! If you want to hide behind your ignorance, go ahead. You're the ignorant one. Come and shut this ignorant mouth. Come on, kid. Shut my mouth. That's it. That's it. That's it. Look... we'll beat this. I've been expecting you. You leave tracks easy enough for a blind man to follow. Things have changed. I can see it in your eyes. I'm a mixed-blood now. The truth was always the truth. Now it is known, and it is good. It's good I lost my girl? That I'm at war with the white man? You have to lose yourself before you find yourself. I can't find crap. It's all decided for me. Are you done whining? Let's walk. Where are we going? To the past. So, you want to hear about White Wolf? In the last days... a girl named Nanebah... took a pony to a special place... where she would pick flowers for her wedding dress. Three white men came upon her. Nanebah was found wandering with her head full of demons... by a white hunter. He became White Wolf, your great-great grandfather. He brought great honor to our people. We accepted him as our own. Did you meet White Wolf? Rest. I will be waiting on the other side. What the hell was in that tea? Where do you want to go with the herd today? I was thinking that little box canyon... with the spring? Grandpa? Grandpa. Thanks for coming. What? Where are we going? Thanks, friend. Black Cloud, what are you doing? I need to talk with Sammie. Daddy. I'm sorry. I've done nothing to dishonor us. I have nothing to be ashamed of. My blood is good. ls this how it's gonna be? 'Cause my heart can't take it. I'm sorry. I'll never leave again. You better not. I will love you forever. I love you. I love you more. I know I don't have much... but whatever I have I will give to you. What are you doing? I know you could do better, but I promise you... you'll never regret giving me a chance. You sure? Will you marry me? Yes! Hello. Hey, Bud, it's Norm Olsen. You still coming? Yeah. We'll be pulling in around 3:00. Great. Just make sure he's in shape... 'cause he's gonna be facing one tough kid. I hope he shows up, 'cause my guy's ready to be seen. Hey, he's never done this before, right? -Uh-uh. -You sure he's up to it? This one's different. He doesn't fight for attention. He fights because he needs to. The sun on my shoulders And the wind at my back Bound and determined to get back on track To where the heart is Where it's been all along Sometimes you don't know what you got till it's gone Gone, gone, gone And I've been out there searching For a place where I belong And on my way I heard my song Let it sing me home Be sure to bring my fiancé home in one piece, OK? That's up to him. I remember the night before Bud fought... for the army championship in Germany. I was pregnant with Christopher at the time... and I was so afraid for him. I didn't know you had a son. Our son was killed... a long time ago by a drunken driver. I'm sorry. Hey, what's up, everyone? This is Missy Bitsui, and she's raised traditionally so she's not down with the English. Isn't she great, man? I think I'm in love. ls this what you guys feel like? Where you guys off to? Gonna shoot some pool. She's the one. I can feel it. She's gonna pop me out a lot of good kids. Jimmy, she doesn't even speak English. How do you know? Body language, Cloudy. That's the only language that doesn't lie. Having some fun, baby? Say exactly how you feel Right now you're free to sail off There is no one here to judge you I only love you You're free to close your eyes and fall You can trust me This is real Say exactly how you feel Tell me... I know we're not married yet... but I was wondering how you felt about having kids. What do you think? I asked you first. I don't think we should rush or anything. The only question in my mind is how many. I love you so much. I love you more. Be ever Mine Hey. you guys want a Coke? Don't forget to breathe. I'll be right back. I'll meet you at the table. Well, I gotta give it to you. You kicked the crap outta me. You're out of the hospital. That's good. It's not good for you. Eddie, look, I'm sorry for what I did to you. But I didn't know the things I know now. When we're done with you, you won't know nothin'. Well, what do you know, boys? Caught us an Indian. -ls that him? -Yeah. That's the one. Hey there, red man. We don't have no plastic L.A. friends Ain't on the edge of no popular trend Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine... My neck's always been red My collar"; still blue We've always been... Jimmy. Jimmy, Black Cloud"; gone. I think something's going down. You've always been Red, white, and blue -Yeah! -Let's get him! Feels good, doesn't it? Come on, red man! How's that feel, huh? Unh! Aah! Who'll save you now, huh? Who's tough now? Go! Get out! Come on, get out! Jimmy? Jimmy! Jimmy! Lay still, man! Lay still! Somebody call for help! Lay still. It's gonna be all right, Jimmy. It's gonna--Somebody call for help! Oh, my God. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. That boy bled a lot. Kid's touch and go. Doesn't look good. Shit. Hell of a night. So, you want to tell me your side? Eddie shoved a bottle in Jimmy's throat. Same Jimmy that's been beatin' on people with pool cues? They were gonna kill Black Cloud if he didn't. Boys were just giving him a little payback. Got a little carried away. But the way I see it... it's just--just an unfortunate accident. Fight gone wrong. Isn't that what Bud called the last one? Those cowboys are going home tonight. It's funny the way justice works, isn't it? It don't care who pays... as long as the scales are evened up. They're not even, and they never will be. You're right. Guess it means we'll be seeing each other again. Black Cloud... hear you're headed to Vegas.

Neutral corner. Neutral corner. By unanimous decision... Black Cloud! Black Cloud, where do you come from? I'm from the Navajo Nation. And what's the Navajo Nation? It's our homeland. Bud, where'd he get his name? In the summertime... when those thunderstorms roll in with black clouds... you'd better duck. Ooh. You like to throw a double hook-uppercut combination. Where'd you learn that, Jack Dempsey? No. I, uh, I fought a big cowboy on the rez. It's the only thing that worked on him. Ain't you funny? But I ain't no cowboy. I'm a nigga from the hood. You ain't never seen someone like me! I guess we'll see about that tomorrow, huh? Tomorrow you're gonna be runnin' till I catch you... and you be cryin' for your mama while I'm hurtin' you! Hey, Rocket, when you gonna take him out? When am I gonna take him out? After you beg me for more... then I'll take him out. Black Cloud, what do you have to say about that? A big mouth is a sign of fear and ignorance. I'll take you on right now, Tonto! You, the Lone Ranger, Silver, your whole goddamn posse! -Let's go. -You ain't shit! Tomorrow. You ain't even in my same league, dude! I got some-thin' real for your ass in these hands! Cut off the ring and bang on his arms. Are you ready? I'm good. How's your hands? They're sore.

Touch gloves and go back to your corner. I'm gonna enjoy this. I know I will. Pay attention. Fake right and drop him. You are the baddest southpaw ever were. This man is a dog. You gotta go fight your fight. He does not belong in the ring with you.

Mile upon mile got no direction We're all playing the same game We're all |ookin' for redemption Just afraid to say the name So caught up now in pretending What we're seeking is the truth I'm just looking for a happy ending All I'm looking for is you YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave You're the reason I'm still here Am I the one you were sent to save? When you came upon me wave on wave I wandered out into the water And I thought that I might drown I don't know what I was after Just knew I was going down That's when she found me Not afraid anymore You said, "You know, I always had you, baby" "Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for" YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave You're the reason I'm still here Am I the one you were sent to save? And you came upon me wave on wave YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave You're the reason I'm still here Am I the one you were sent to save? You came upon me wave by wave Wave on I fell by the wayside I fell on my knees Crying Why was I so hard to please? I stood at the crossroads Took a long look at me Sometimes you don't know where you're from till you leave And I been out there searchin' For a place where I belong And on my way I heard my song Let it sing me home Sun on my shoulders And the wind at my back Bound and determined to get back on track To where the heart is Where it's been all along Sometimes you don't know what you've got till it's gone Gone, gone, gone And I been out there searchin' For a place where I belong And on my way I heard my song Let it sing me home
