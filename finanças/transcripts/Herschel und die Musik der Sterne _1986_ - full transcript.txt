HERSCHEL AND THE MUSIC OF THE STARS A film by Percy Adlon Joseph Haydn, hailed in London as the most celebrated composer of his time had been to England twice. At the end of his first visit, in June of 1792 he went from Windsor Castle to the neighbouring village of Slough to see the giant telescope built by the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel. Mr. Herschel is closer to the stars than any other human being. What's that big thing there? That contraption? It's the wonder of Slough. But with my bad English... From Hannover. German! German! Oh, that's fine. What did he say? I hope it stays shut! Is the driver here already? He was supposed to come tomorrow morning. No. Please! No visitors! It' unbelievable. A constant stream! And they never give prior notice! Is he gone? You can't send him away. In God's name does every nobleman have to brag he's had a look through my telescope? I'm not court jester who-- Wilhelm, you will receive this man! Not today, even if the King himself were to-- It's Haydn. Haydn who? Our Haydn. Joseph Haydn! What? Wilhelm, your coat! Excuse me, she's not -- She's-- I beg your pardon, Madame. I am not Mrs. Herschel. Excuse me, in my excitement I forgot to introduce my dear sister... Caroline Herschel. Here. This is our mechanical-- Pardon me. Let's call it... Bless you, Maestro! ...our witches' kitchen. We try in vain to separate our private lives from our work. We don't quite take our tools to bed with us, but almost. Excuse me, this is our brother, Alexander. Good day! Pleased to meet you. Good day. Lina, a little refreshment, please. That's not my job. You came straight from Windsor? Yes, the King told me about you yesterday and let me look through his telescope. We were just packing a small, 7-foot telescope like the one the King purchased from me. Are they expensive? How much do they cost? The observatory in Würzburg is paying 400 guineas for this one. My respects! That's the price of a house and garden in Vienna. But they'll only pay if we get it shipped today. What did you see from Windsor? It was a very clear night. We admired your construction that big thing you have here. So it was by day. You observed my 40-foot telescope. Yes, indeed! Water? Yes, thank you. That's very kind of you! Some soap? Thank you so much! Alex, hand me the flange, please. Then you have a surprise in store tonight. Your first look at the stars. The heavenly fields. With all the 'twinkling little stars'. Lina. Where are the bolts for 17-B? Is it true that you discovered a new star... ...at the far edge of the firmament? My dear Maestro, Space has no far edge. It's as infinite as music. You mean as the combination of notes-- Exactly! It's boundless. And the universe is even more inconceivable. I beg your pardon. Your coat-- The bolts for 17-B. I had the good fortune to discover the eighth planet. I named it after our good King George but the scientific world calls it Uranus. A new planet! You ought to be world famous. My brother is world-famous. The Haydn of astronomy, so to speak. Lina, please! Yes there was quite a stir in the scientific community about the self-taught astronomer and his homemade telescope. But my learned colleagues eventually did send their congratulations. And ordered telescopes. Ebony! Very fine work! Do you know a bit about carpentry? I come from a long line of wheelwrights. My father was a master coach builder in Rohrau to the east of Vienna, almost in Hungary. Yes, we love it when you start speaking Hungarian-- I mean, in your music. The third movements, the 'folky' motifs. Oh, yes, people enjoy that. You must employ a great number of craftsmen in London. No, everything is done here. We do a great deal ourselves. But for the large telescope we sometimes had 40 people working here. My brother Alexander is our master carpenter. Come, I'll show you Uranus orbit. Here you see the relative scales of Sun... Venus... Earth and Moon... Mars... Jupiter... Mars... Jupiter... Saturn... and the new planet, Georgium Sidus, Uranus with its two moons. The moons were part of the bargain. Is it really like that? Are we just a little ball? Constantly racing around in circles? Our Earth, the planets, the comets and the meteors are barely more than one thousandth of the Sun's mass. We are like specks of dust dancing around the Sun. Our solar system is already quite well explored. My discovering Uranus was only a by-product. I have penetrated the trans-solar zone. What? Beyond the vault? The heavenly vault? Once I magnified my eyesight enough to penetrate the distant worlds of the Milky Way, there no longer was a vault. Just millions and millions of suns. With planets circling around them. I measure the distances of stars. I register them. I calculate their movements. The farthest nebula visible to us contains suns much larger than our own. And all these enormous amounts of matter are whirling constantly through space. That's one of Alexander's toys. It doesn't have to be wound every 12 hours. It cuckoos for a whole week. Except when it breaks down. But at least to relax you play music in the evenings. Much to Lina's displeasure, we don't have the time. The night... Do you need me? Go ahead. The night is our main work time. Our nights belong to the stars! Come, Maestro, it's still light out. I want to show you the 40-foot telescope by daylight. Can you get along without me for a while? Yes, Lina, go ahead. Careful! I'm lowering the tubus. My place is up there, on the platform. That's where you, my dear Maestro, will sit tonight. The weather looks promising. Clear view. My sister usually sits in the machine room and writes down what I dictate to her from up here. And the two helpers move the entire telescope to the millimetre, according to my instructions. You get them up in the middle of the night just to look around up there a little? A little, my dear Maestro? We devote every clear night to our work! You don't say! And there's always something new to see? We have several areas of study. One example being a complete index of all the heavenly bodies of the Northern Sky. From this will come an atlas of the stars the likes of which has never existed. Well made. Good craftsmanship. Yes, indeed, Alexander's work. He's such a pleasant fellow. Another area of research concerns- Don't you think this wooden ring is a little weak for all that weight up there? You know, a lot goes on here every day but it's all precisely calculated. Yes, and so much money spent. Tell me, how much did the whole contraption cost? For that price, you think one could- Since I wasn't able to purchase a telescope then, I bought old tools from a mirror marker. And began to polish mirrors myself -with Caroline's assistance. It took a long time! 25 years of trial and error, before this one was installed. But little by little, everything worked out. Each failure was actually a small step forward. Practice makes perfect. As a boy, I used to whittle willow whistles on Neusiedlersee and imitate birdcalls. Come, climb up onto the platform. Don't worry. You won't have to give a sermon. Just go up and take a look at the metal concave mirror. The Sun is in a good position. Go on. I feel like a boy climbing up a cherry tree. The ocular is on your right. You look down into it to observe the sky. The stars are reflected by a concave mirror. There's another technique but mine is still the best, the most sensitive to light. To be honest, I only came here to speak a little German for a change. I hear you used to be considered a superb organist, a fine musician indeed. I was told of splendid performances, of the Messiah, and of several extraordinary compositions of your own. Music was my means of livelihood for many years. But above all, it allowed me time to pursue my two great passions astronomy and mathematics. The laws of music led me to the laws of the stars. So, with no regret, I left music down here. And now I am a listener every night to the music of the stars. Ah. Oh my God! Are you hurt? I told Alexander to fix that rung! Are you hurt? Drink this. It will do you good. Thank you. Most kind. I'd better be going. But- No, I've been a nuisance. The most important-- The most important thing, my dear Dr. Herschel, is one's health. And to me, most of the time, music. Would you happen to have a drop of wine for me? Regards to your brother Alexander. Such a pleasant fellow! But the stars-- Please come inside. The food is on the table. Lina, Dr. Haydn suddenly wants to leave. Tell me, what is "Lina" short for? Elizabeth? Malvina? Caroline. She has a middle name as well-- Lucretia. Then I'll call you Lucretia if I may. My name is Miss Herschel. Go ahead and start. I want to fix the ladder first. Would you like a glass of wine? I certainly would, Lucr- uh, Miss Herschel. Strange and not bad either. But untouched, so to speak. That can't be, though not on this whorish island. Well, perhaps in this isolation-- Him always in the world and us, here in our isolation. The papers are always full of news concerning you but your wife is never mentioned. My wife won't even cross the Danube, let alone the English Channel. Its money better saved. Do you really want to stay in England for good? Heaven forbid! In one month the old workhorse can go home to his stall, to his beloved, dear old Austria. But this must be the achievement of a lifetime for you. Do you have any idea what it's like for a country boy like me to find himself in the biting wind of a big city? For a musician who spent so many quiet years in the service of a duke who appreciated music, to suddenly be the prize ape in that London circus, constantly being paid to perform new tricks? Look! Another new devilish invention! Another something the country bumpkin has never seen. We're part of a group of scientists who are testing the efficacy of gas lamps for indoor lighting. Have you caught cold? No, I've had it all my life. Bless you! Blessing it won't help. I have this thing-- this thing in my thing a large polyp in my nose and it always tickles when-- I don't know when the weather changes, or I pick up a dusty book, or when a gas lamp for indoor lighting is being tested... A growth like that can easily be removed surgically. The size of a man's member grows in proportion to his nose. Alex! Only a nobleman speaks like that these days. Indeed, I came close to losing mine as a boy. How? I had a fine soprano voice as a boy. I sang in the St. Stefan's choir in Vienna. My uncle had taken me from home when I was six. He was the rector in Hainburg and I became his assistant. I learned a great deal about music from him. Then he more or less sold me to Vienna. Reutter, the bandmaster, treated us like little slaves there. When we reached puberty and our voices broke it was the end for the most of us. We were put out on the street. Mercilessly. But they told me I could stay, if I let go... ...of a little something... Then I could keep my high voice forever. The called it being "sopranisized". Fortunately, they had to ask father first. He hightailed it to Vienna as though the devil himself were chasing him, tore open the door of our dormitory, saw me and without even asking - it could've already taken place- screamed: "Does it hurt? Can you walk?" So, he saved me in that respect, but that's when my hard times as a Viennese street musician began. Did you repair the ladder, Alex? It's a clear night. Aren't you eating, Lucr-- Miss Herschel? I'm not hungry. It promises to be a rewarding night. What are these fragments? Lovely how they dazzle and reflect! Very original. It was Lina's idea. Which brings us back to astronomy. I'd rather not... It was the first large mirror we cast that seemed to be a success But then, even after the metal had solidified it tore with a horrible bang. With a bang. The entire world is coming apart with a bang! Why do you think, there are so many Frenchmen in London? Musicians have never been as plentiful or as cheap. The nobility never learned anything except a little music. At first they were sympathized with as refugees from the Revolution, but now the wind is shifting. Because they're complaining and going into debt. The food, the weather nothing satisfied them. And those are the most harmless results of the French Revolution. All our ideas were turned upside down in 1789. Politically, my dear Doctor. I'm all for it. The idea that all men are brothers, free and equal must appeal to you as well. When I think of the humiliations we went through- At Castle Esterhazy, my musicians weren't allowed to have their wives with them. And how long did I fight against wearing liveries to no avail! Against getting bossed around! We could continue our conversation outside. He doesn't want to. - What? - He doesn't want to! Of course, all this bloodshed is gruesome. But I believe it is necessary, if things are to change. The world can't go on like this, with so many living in luxury, and so many... so many suffering. May I suggest a walk in the garden? An ideal time for observation. Are we having dessert? I'm an old sweet tooth. I-- we -- You certainly are a good cook. I'm neither a good cook nor a bad one. I never cook. But you run your brothers' household and assist them in everything. I am an astronomer appointed to his Majesty. I'm paid a yearly salary of £50 and discovered my fifth comet last Friday. Never mind, then, Lucretia, Miss Herschel. Let's continue talking politics. It's so good to speak German again. You're being coy, Herr Haydn. Your English must be perfect. With your honorary degree from Oxford, Herr Haydn, Doctor Haydn. All I did was curtsy and say 'I zank you' after they put a ruffle around my neck and a robe over my shoulders. I had to parade around London for three days in that outfit. I'm going to show you how good your English is. And the degree cost plenty. One and a half guineas for the honor. A half guinea for the robe and six for the journey to Oxford and back. I had to pay for everything myself. What is he afraid of? He's afraid of the stars. Does he think his creative compass will go out of whack if he looks into the cosmos? Would you ... ... perform in my next concert in London, Miss Herschel? You wanted to call me Lucretia. Come into the night. The stars are waiting. Lift up the seat barrier. Take your place. Reach behind you and close the seat barrier. Take off your hat, please Maestro. It blocks the rays. Put the ocular cap on. It's on your left. Did you put the ocu-cap on? We have the telescope aimed at the Cassiopia constellation. If you have a question use the speaking tube on your left. The brightest star in the middle - What's wrong? Just let him look. He'll ask if he has any questions. The creation is-- Almost two hours now. He must be freezing. He'll catch a coat. I'll fetch a coat. My dear, dear friend. You've created something truly unique. And my being so afraid to look through it that wasn't dumb of me after all. I almost didn't come back down from your heaven. Now you must explain to me exactly what you are doing. I confess I wasn't paying attention this afternoon. So please tell me everything. Tell me what books there are and where I can find other telescopes so I can visit your stars again. I think I'm hooked. The images that have touched your heart are like a single stone in a vast mosaic. Or like a few chords in a great piece of music. Your senses perceive impressions that are new and entirely coincidental. The connections, the laws, the constructions or composition of the whole finding those has led me to magnify my eyes thousands and thousands of times. And in so doing, I happened to discover that our planet is not inside a hollow sphere with fixed stars attached to the shell. Our solar system is constantly revolving around itself. Like many other systems, it is part of a similar but immensely larger system. We are racing towards the center of that system. We are racing towards the Hercules Constellation. Hercules Constellation And the center that exerts its pull on our solar system and others like it is located somewhere in the Milky Way and is probably being pulled by an even larger center. And so on and so on. And so on. Exactly like musical harmony which on the one hand is subject to very strict laws and relationships but on the other hand is free to form every possible combination. Yes. But we are open to music as a form of pleasure, or entertainment, or consolation. Astronomers will need many years until this science which is both empirical and philosophical will be accepted as useful and important for humanity. Yes, that is what interests me. I am very practical. How does all of this affect our lives ... ... as human beings. You must distinguish between two areas of inquiry. The first area deals with the cosmos beyond our solar system. It is so unfathomable that it has little to do with us. The other, however, affects us directly: my observations of the Sun, the Moon and the planets. Mars, for example, is the planet most similar to ours. And if you consider all our modern inventions, steam power, electricity, crossing the channel in a hot air balloon. Shouldn't it be possible to rise even higher some day? Beyond the pull of the Earth? Beyond the gravitational pull of the Earth. What I'd give to be able to travel by time machine to a future century to see if man is capable of setting foot on another celestial body. And if up there- There is neither 'up' nor 'down'. To me, it's still 'up there'. What if it is too cold, or too warm? What if there is too much air for us, or not enough? Did you see the drawing inside? It is a diving suit by Leonardo da Vinci. You can take air down with you. Why not up as well? Now you even said 'up'. A trip to the moon, for example, would require mathematical instruments that could calculate deviations in rotation in mere seconds. Please stop! If I weren't so dizzy already, what you are saying would make my head spin. You, a renowned scientist, are considering things that we ridiculed in an opera at Esterhazy Castle We called it 'The World on the Moon'. We had a moon cannon on stage that, pardon me for laughing, looked a lot like your telescope. And how did the Earth look from up there? Look? The Moon didn't look. He was made to look like a fool. The character in the opera, that is. What would the singer playing him have seen? He would have seen the Earth rise, like we see the Moon. Only larger. Would he have met any forms of life there? In principle, there could be living beings anywhere, even on the Sun. They would be as adapted to their environment as we are to ours. By the way, I believe I've observed an active volcano on the Moon three times. Any people? No, unfortunately not, Maestro. No 'people'. None at all. It could be that the cosmic seed only germinated on one planet, on ours. Led to evolution. But there could be one inhabited planet in each of the other solar systems, too. Will it ever be possible to prove that the stars in those systems circle each other? After observing two stars every night for 14 years, tiny points of light in the nebula of the Milky Way, it became apparent that the weaker star was not simply farther away but in all those years had completed one quarter of its orbit around the brighter star. You spend the entire night with those two little stars? No, we have a very extensive program. Those two stars are among the hundreds we chart every night. Little by little, Caroline and I are completing the largest atlas of stars that has ever been done. A peculiar life, keeping watch all night, sleeping all day. I don't sleep all day. People don't need much sleep. But I get awfully cold up there. I must devise some means against these shivering fits. Build a big tent around your telescope. It wouldn't work. The mirror has to be the same temperature. Otherwise our measurements aren't exact. But you asked me about practical aspects. I studied the wheat prices to find out whether the harvests varied with the activity of the spots on the Sun. These sunspots come and go I suspect, periodically. Sometimes they're stronger sometimes they're weaker. The stronger the activity of the sunspots, the milder the climate. I also discovered that not only light emits rays, but heat as well- which have quite similar characteristics. In the final phase of the red spectrum there are heat rays- These sunspots are they clouds? They are immensely powerful tornadoes in which large amounts of glowing gases merge with layers of other gases in the Sun's atmosphere. And what about God? Caroline brought a coat for you. Lucretia. Why do you call her that? Your visit has obviously done Lina good. Oh, come now! An old man like myself! Oh, yes, it has. If I didn't know here as well as I do- strange, I could have sworn she was flirting with you. She almost scratched my eyes out at first. You should see her when she's really in form. Has she always been alone? Alone? She has me and Alexander. Yes, but-- And we have more visitors every day than we care for. Doesn't she have a man in her life? Of course not. Where would that leave me, and our work? After all, she is my scientific assistant and she loves her profession. Let's sit down a moment. You see, everything was fine until I got married four years ago. How nice for you. That's what I thought, too. My wife is uh-- rather well-to-do. Interesting. And I am now financially independent. At your age it ought to pay. But Lina wouldn't spend another night in this house. She doesn't live with you? She won't eat or sleep here anymore. She doesn't want to be indebted. The two women don't get along? My wife is very fond of Lina. She is away vising her parents with our little son, John. Lina loves her little nephew almost too much. I'm afraid I don't understand it. Miss Herschel is here every day. On the day of my wedding, Lina moved to a room almost two miles from here. She would arrive every morning after breakfast and transcribe my notes then return to her room for lunch. She'd come back later and assist me each night, weather permitting. Only to go back to her room in the morning to sleep. She had a falling-out with her landlords, moved, and continued her coming and going. She's moved 13 times in the past four years. And strangely enough, the houses she rented rooms in, are all approximately two miles from this house circling it. Like a heavenly body circling its sun. She loves you. Of course, but-- More than a brother. Tea's ready. I'm an old sweet tooth. Can't help it. It's never been so cold this time of year. Yes, English weather- But the humidity here gives the women such beautiful skin. So soft-- Have a biscuit? Thank you. I thought you didn't eat here. May I ask you a question, Master Haydn? Of course. Well, I imagine you-- you turn everything into music-- Now that you've had your first look at the stars -- No one can represent the miracle of creation through music. No one. Whether something happened inside of me tonight, I don't know. When I was a boy -- I used to lie in the reeds by the lake and look at the stars. And whenever I started getting dizzy, the voices of the animals around me would calm me down again. Tonight, those stars from my childhood were suddenly as close as my hand right before my eyes. I thought I'd become frightened and need the voices in the bulrushes but suddenly, I felt lighter and smaller, and I forgot myself entirely. I heard-- No, I don't know if I heard anything. I don't want to say that I shouldn't have seen it, but I'm someone who is content with proximity and well I should be. On my trip here-- to England, that is--I met a young man a wild, black-haired devil -- in Bonn I met him. He played something for me on his organ. Ludwig Beethoven. His music -- That's the new age. It made me think of the French Revolution and of the Americans declaring their independence. He doesn't worry if people like his music. He put his most personal feelings into it without following any dictates. He's so far out... He's the one! He's the one who could compose the stars, what I saw tonight. We are old-fashioned types with our respect for our patrons we're only free if our music is appreciated. But I don't mind that at all. I'm better off being reined in a bit. I prefer sitting inside, having tea and chatting rather than being out in that maze of stars. And that's just how I craft my orderly little compositions. Little? How can you call your music little? Let me explain that, Lucretia. I'm every bit as thrifty - I can't help it - I'm just as thrifty with my ideas as with my money. I begin by fantasizing on the piano. Every morning if possible, until I have a small idea. When I have one, I examine it, question it, vary it and build on it. Similar to scientific inquiry in miniature. When I've worked on it long enough, the little idea shows its gratitude by calling all its relatives-- small, medium and sometimes even a grand, important one. When I have the whole family, I can construct a piece of music. Listeners can hear that it's not some stupid coincidence holding the music together. Instead, it's like a group portrait of an entire family. In spite of it all they are all unmistakably Hubers or Herschels. What do you say to my village square method, my learned friend? He wasn't listening. What did you say? I beg your pardon. You missed something that's irretrievable. I was thinking about Gamma Herculis. As far as your income is concerned-- Yes? Have you had any 'important relatives' in that respect? This whole England trip is like a rich uncle. But I'm so used to being thrifty unlike my, thank heavens, faraway wife. Have you considered an endowment for science? Between Vienna and Plattensee Very kind! I have 17 to 25 needy relatives with their beaks always wide open. They are my endowment. I am the typical case of a nobody becoming a somebody. An educated man like you, on the other hand-- My father was a musician in the military in Hannover. I had to march with him playing the oboe when I was just a skinny 12-year-old kid. Later, I even had to go with him into battle. I came to England with the army and deserted. But music remained my means of livelihood. The mathematical laws of music became my passion leading me to study math and astronomy, as my poor father had done in a dilettantish way. I, too, was a dilettante when I built the best telescope in the world. Because I am convinced that the future of mankind is not limited to this small planet. I was scorned as a dilettante, so as as dilettante I built that monster out there, which stands as a monument to my obsession but unfortunately is compelled unsuited to my work. Wilhelm, you're going too far! Completely unsuited, I say. Too cumbersome in its movements. And that mirror-- which weighs tons-- We could get crushed by it when we go through the torture of taking it out to polish it because it gets dull so fast-- But all your observations every night. I use my smaller telescope for that. The big one is just for show, for all our curious visitors. My sunspot theory is laughed at by professional colleagues as the most outlandish nonsense since "Gulliver's Travels". And my newest discovery, the heat rays, in the far end of the Sun's red spectrum- "infra-red rays" I call them-- it won't fare much better. But the name Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel will go down in history next to those Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. Yes, Wilhelm. Dear Mr. Herschel, this old horse wants to go back to his stall, even if it's not his own. Won't you be our guest? No, no, no. The coachman has to get home to his wife. Would you ask him to get the carriage ready? Now your work begins. What do you think, Lina? Let's make an exception tonight. We'll let Joseph Haydn's visit sink into us. Then you could take Lina home. It's on your way. I always walk. Lina go get you things and let this cavalier take you home. Farewell. You are a fine man. That one? No, that one. Oh, that one! No, that one! The bright one? The one right next to it. Where? I don't see anything. It's very faint. Yes, now I see it! And that's a comet? You need a telescope to see the tail. The big contraption? No, I have my own comet searching glass at home. You must show it to me, by all means! I didn't know you were so interested in-- Me? I'm just getting started. First you fire one's interest then you leave him out in the cold. All right. It'll be light soon. You can put your hat there. I can't even offer you a glass of wine. Listen! A reed-warbler, good singer. Please, forgive me. Here sit down. How thoughtless of me! I'll sit on the bed and, please you take the chair. Listen! I can tell them all apart. Singing is the world's most beautiful thing. Then sing! You have a professional-- My brother-- Why always your brother? I've done nothing and I am nothing. Everything I am I owe to my brother. I'm nothing but the instrument he formed suit his needs. A well-trained dog could almost do the same things. That's not true, Lucretia. No. I'm not the least bit tired. Shall we chat a little? With pleasure. Tell me something about yourself. My brother told you everything. We were seven children. On my sister's wedding day everybody danced. So did I. Then suddenly I noticed that I was dancing alone. I had to do the housework. I wasn't much good at it. I wanted to learn, to study. But my mother wouldn't permit it. My brothers left home. I loved Wilhelm the most. He was always gentle and friendly to me. He went to England. Then came the happiest day of my life. A letter came from my brother. He wanted me to join him and be trained as a singer. My mother wouldn't allow it. He had taken a position as an organist in Bath. He needed someone to run the household and sing in the choir. He appeared at the door one day and took me with him. He began teaching me English the morning after I arrived. And arithmetic and book-keeping. I was also supposed to be transformed into a lady. I enjoyed the choir the most. I wrote down all the parts for everyone, sometimes over 100 singers. My brother also taught me how to sing. I became his soloist. He gave music lessons to two dozen others as well. He'd ride all night to play the organ the next day in some dark little village, while I copied music, voice for voice and prepared the rehearsals for him. Then came the day he received Dr. Smith's book "Optics and Mechanics" and discovered instructions on how to build telescopes. You'll be more comfortable there. We had our music during the day and nights were spent trying to cast the mirrors until our hands were burned. Alex had joined us in the meantime and helped. We finally succeeded in casting one. Then attempted polishing it. After endless experiments, we found the best way ways-- Dung! Yes, horse manure. It's dried, then sifted. God, did I sift a lot of horse manure! The mirror is then laid in this mulch and must be rotated in one direction, without interruption, only in one direction, for 10 to 20 hours. When my brother polished a mirror all night I'd sit beside him, reading Cervantes and feeding him. And if he fell asleep, I'd take over for him. All that time I had a desire to be self-sufficient, not to have to account to anyone, to be independent, free. That's what was so important about discovering the comet. The King gave me a yearly salary. Its only £50. One could easily spend that much in a month. But I always put a little aside. I don't need much. That's my freedom. I don't have to ask anyone of anything. Thank you. It was very nice. Farewell. It is not unknown to me, Dr. Haydn, that you are a ladies' man. And I do not intend to let myself be made unhappy. I simply want to enjoy a night with the most famous composer of our time, a man who is not unappealing to me. So don't disappoint me. Your reputation is at stake.
