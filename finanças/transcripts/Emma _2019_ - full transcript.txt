Pretty girl. Dad. Dad. Are the kids up? - Dad, it's late. - No... Late for what? No, no! It's late! It's late. Her first communion! - Get the shoes! - The girls! And the shoes! Honey, don't move. - If you move, I can't fix it. - But it hurts. I can't... - Take María, please. - That's Anna, Dad. Really? - She always pukes on me. - Babies are always puking. Relax, it's not that bad. Good morning. Come in, please. Momma Giraffe, where is my certificate? I turned it in last month. - Where's the candle? - Right here, honey. Mom, the Bible. Here it is. Look. We know it's a big deal. We didn't forget anything. Mom, did you call my godmother? You called Teresa, right? Well... Don't worry. I can be your godmother. The girls are crying. - Excuse me. - Hold on. The Holy Scripture talks about faith. But what is faith? Is faith something you have? Are we born with it? Can we acquire it? Can we buy faith? Is God faith? Is there one true faith and the rest is not faith? Those are all valid questions. And we answer them ourselves. Today I'd like to talk about the role of faith. Faith is the light that brightens our lives. Gross... And sin is the stain that overshadows it. We need to erase that stain. Sins that seem minor like being unkind, or selfish... We are always late... Turning away when someone asks for help. - You never... - It's always my fault. - Where's the diaper bag? - What bag? Those are all stains that affect our faith and happiness. Real faith requires action. We have to help each other. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Emma. Emma. It's your turn. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. There you go! That's it! Pass it! Pass the ball! No! Yes! Yes! Kick it! Goal! Goal! Let's go, team! Kick the ball! Watch out! Hello. Where is everyone? - Don't worry about that. - Am I dead? No, you're here because I wanted to talk to you. I have something very important to tell you. God wants you to be a saint. - What? - You have to find faith. - I don't understand. - But you will. Emma. Emma! - Excuse me, kids. - Are you okay? Emma. - Baby... - Emma, honey... Emma! - Answer me, honey. - Emma. - Baby, please, are you okay? - My dear. What were you doing? - Baby... - You need to be more careful. - My baby, don't scold her. - Look at you, baby. Let's use this ointment to keep it from swelling. I think you shouldn't let her fall asleep. What if she has a concussion, I heard that... Don't say that. I'm saying this because she was unconscious. - Mom? - What? Does God give errands to people? Errands? Yes, for example, does he ask you to do things? - Do you think God talked to you? - Yes, Momma Giraffe. Are you sure you're okay, honey? Then let's try to get some sleep. - Today was a busy day... - Yes. - I love you, honey. - Me too. I think she needs a doctor. Should we monitor her? Yes, she's talking about God and... Emma, why aren't you doing the exercise? - Mother Betty... - Yes. How do I become a saint? Hey! Quiet! You could start by doing your exercise. That might help. Come on. Hello. What is this! Mother Gloria, do you have books about saints? Yes, I have a Holy Bible. It explains everything about the Holy Apostles. Is there something shorter? Like an instruction manual! Or something that explains how to become a saint. A saint... Yes, I think so. We must have something. But... Why don't you look for it yourself? You might find something. Go on. Okay. One, two, three. Go on. I'll tell you when. Turn right after the third one. There, turn right. Biology, Spanish, Logic... Exact Sciences. Poetry. THE LEAGUE OF FAITH SAVING THE WORLD It's okay, baby, Mommy is coming, I'm coming. Baby Bear, your sisters are conspiring against me. One of them is always crying. It's very suspicious. I didn't know you liked comic books. Saint Barbara's dad cut her head off. What? I like comic books too. That's why I like to draw. Yes, my babies. "Saints should always be your role models." "Saint Francis of Assisi. Freedom in Poverty." All living beings should be free. Hi, baby! Saints make sacrifices. That's Saint Apollonia. The pagans are burning her... But she didn't die. That's great. First, they tried to burn her. Then they cut her head off and that's how she died. What? Quiet. Emma, you were supposed to draw what you wanted to be. That's what I did, Mother. - I want to be a saint. - A saint. You want to get your head cut off then? Yago, raise your hand if you have a question. - Thanks, Emma. - You're welcome. Who's up next? Come in. - Hi, my Baby Bear. - Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom. Honey. Please, talk about your drawing. Tell the Mother Superior about your dreams, Emma. I want to be a saint, Mother. Santa Claus... Or Roque Santa Cruz, a Paraguayan soccer player. - He was great. - No. Tell them how you got the idea. A little lamb told me I had to be a saint. - A lamb? - Yes. She's not being serious. You're not, right, honey? Of course I am, Dad. Emma. God doesn't talk to little girls to tell them to become saints. But He talked to me. I'm sorry, Mother, this must be related to the blow in her head. We should have gone to the ER. Yes. Mother, I promise... - No, I swear... - Don't swear. Can you believe this? This one was decapitated too. Why not make less dramatic stories about saints? Because that would be boring. That's why they don't. Thanks. I think it's normal. That she wants to be a saint? When little, I wanted to be a nun. Really? I loved "The Sound of Music." Remember that? No. Well, the point is I forgot about it. And I think she will too. Mom, Dad, good morning. Good morning, baby. I got you some comic books. See? Yes, but I won't like them. I was reading something else. I wanted to know more about saints. It's okay, honey. If you don't like it, it's fine. Dad and I want to make you an offer. Dad can give you his cell phone. - What? - I don't need it. - Great. - Honey, it's a joke. Saints don't have time for jokes, Mom. Your mom and I want you to do extracurricular activities. You can choose a sport... Or art. If you like comic books, you could learn to draw them. - Or karate. - Or ballet. What do you think? - Or soccer! - I used to love ballet. - Or soccer too. - Let her chose. - Yes, Giraffe, it's her choice. - I'm just giving her options... Ready and one, two... three, four, and plié. One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight... This thing of being a saint is harder than I thought. There's no right way to become one, Emma. - Hi, Father. - I heard you had a vision. Yes, did God send you to help me? You say a lamb told you to be a saint? - Yes. - And what does that mean? Like Saint Teresa and Saint Barbara. And all their superpowers. Emma, this isn't like comic books. Real saints performed miracles. So I need to learn to perform miracles. That's not how it works. God makes miracles. And sometimes God picks someone as an intermediary. So what do I do? Be good, be nice, be a good girl. I'm sure God will hear your prayers. And He will give you a chance to prove your faith. Quiet! Take a seat! This is Andrés, your new classmate. We are all going to do our best to make him feel at home. Hi, Andrés! Why don't you help us with morning prayers? No. Don't be nervous. We can help you. Yes, we can help you. I won't pray. - Why not? - I don't believe in God. No way! Take a seat, please. Can you help us with morning prayers? Yes, of course. Thanks. Let's put our hands together and... "Our Father, who art in Heaven..." hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, "Thy will be done..." - Good morning. - Good morning. Mother, this is the kid who refused to pray. - Thanks, Mother. - Excuse me. Andrés. Let's talk. I will think about it. Are you following me? No. Okay, I am. Why? I have a question. What is it? Why don't you believe in God? I have my reasons. What do you care? I just wanted to know. Why won't you eat, baby? How was school? Good, I met a new boy. Really? Cool. What's he like? I think I have a mission. What kind of mission? A secret mission. Good luck with your mission, honey. Does anyone know what's the meaning of "metropolitan area"? Mother Betty, is it true that the Morelos Stadium was built over a dungeon? It is. My dad said some hippies from ancient time were locked in there. And that's why our team never wins. Yes, it was built over a cemetery. - What? - Don't be alarmed. Our team will win this year. That's impossible. Let's hope it does, Andrés. Okay, curses are not real, so let's talk about blessings. Blessings do exist. What is the difference between blessings and curses? Can anyone tell me? Blessings and curses are complete opposites. So we have 365 churches... Mother Betty! Do churches have dungeons? Enough, kids. So, what's the meaning of "metropolitan area"? Me! It's a place full of dungeons. Quiet! Our city is more than that... Thanks to Saint Emma, I believe in God and I pray every day. She converted me like St. Francis and the pagans. Bravo! Hi, Andrés. Want to go to the chapel during recess? No. Okay, maybe next time. If you want, we can play a "pick" game. You mean a pick-up game? Yes, that. - Do you like soccer? - Yes, I love it. But you like faith better. Let me be honest. We can't play for the same team. You play for the nuns' team. And I don't. Okay? Valdés, the Chilean player... If they keep this up, we're going to lose. Dad, is the Morelia Stadium really cursed? My inquisitive child. It's been 18 minutes... Come here. It's an amazing team. Help me, honey. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. - You know what makes it great? - What? They never give up. They fight till the end. That's super important. Now let me show you something really special. This was my first ticket. Wow, that's old! Yes, it's true... Legend has it our stadium is cursed. But if there's a curse, there's a blessing. That's great news. You know why? - One day we'll end the curse. - That would be a miracle! I think it would require a lot of team work. Use the bridge of your foot. The what? Use this part of the foot to kick the ball. - Do you want to play soccer? - Yes. Really? Wow! I mean, that's amazing. I never thought I'd hear one of my daughters say that. Why not? Girls can play. Of course they can! And very well. Very, very well! Wow! It's super easy. Even for Cuauhtémoc Blanco. You are so much smarter, so you can learn super-fast. She's taking ballet. But she likes soccer now. It's not my fault. I did ballet as a kid. What's wrong with that? Ballet is great. Yeah, was that before or after your obsession with comic books? If she gets knocked out again and we lose her, it's on you. What if she gets knocked out and we get her back? Relax. Emma's always been odd. But it's part of her charm. I still think that whole thing about being a saint is very odd. No matter how much we believe, it's odd. Okay, now she likes soccer. Right. Perfect. The first thing you need to know is that a pass is key. I need the ball right here. It's easy, kick it. It's no big deal, Emma. Not everyone gets it right away. It's okay. The point is to get the ball to the other side. Okay. You'll practice with this when I'm not home. This is how you zigzag. Why? So you can dribble... Use the outside... Good. Now the inside. Yes! Last one! Well done! From this tree to that one is your goal. One, two... I'm losing! Three. Kick! And she's kicking! - Goal! - Goal! Yes! It needs to be now. It's hard to say that Pumas... What does? We need a second goal now. So our team gains confidence and the other team doesn't. Now, he's attacking! No, no, no. What a tackle. Come on, team! Come on! As far as power goes. Yes, sir, people... Let him score, let him score. Let him score, let him score. Let him score, let him score. Let him score, let him score. Let him score, let him score. Goal! Emma scores! Father, do you like soccer? No, I don't. Do you? I do. I'm using it to fulfill my mission. - Want some? - Thank you, Emma. Father, have you ever converted anyone? No. But I've never really tried. Remember, Emma. Faith is personal. God gave us free will. That's why we each chose what to believe in. Father, did you know soccer requires a lot of faith? Hello. - Did you watch the game? - I did. Too bad the Monarcas lost, right? Can I play? No, girls don't play. Of course they do. There's a girls' team here. - That's weird. - Please, let me play. - No. - What if I can score a goal? If you do, I'll let you play. - And if you don't? - I leave. Okay. Ready. Goal! Come on! Get up. - My turn. - No, it's mine. Okay. Take it from me. Come on, try! No! Nutmeg! - Can I get a soda? - My treat. - What flavor? - Strawberry. Thanks. Thanks. - Let's go. - Anything else? No, that's it. Thanks. - Want some? - No. - I know why you don't. - Why? Because you're odd, kids say you want to be a saint. - Right? - No, of course not. THE LEAGUE OF FAITH - Winger. - What? Wingers are small, quick and skillful. That's Emma's natural position. We'll see. Yes, of course we will. In due time. - Mom? - What is it, honey? If someone sins and I eat some of it, is that a sin too? Just tell me what happened. What is it, honey? We don't keep secrets. - Tell me, what did you eat? - Chocolate. Honey, it's okay to eat it every once in a while. But it wasn't mine. I only ate it to please someone. Honey, everyone does stuff to be liked, it's fine. I agree with your dad. Having chocolate is not a sin. As long as you don't eat ten bars. Ten? You've had ten bars. - This one is mine. - Hey! - Give me some of it! - Why didn't you get me one? "A miracle." IT'D BE A MIRACLE IF THE SCORER WERE ABLE TO PLAY AGAIN. Hello. Did you do your Math homework? - No. - I can help you. - Is it long? - A little. Then no. You're a little lazy. Want to play soccer later? No, I can't. I'm grounded. - What for? - You're very nosy. Of course not. If you want, you can come over. Okay, see you later. Hello. Is Andrés home? No, no, no. Goal! You're terrible. No, I'm not! I'd never played before. The score? Seven-null for Morelia. I want to be in Morelia too. - No, you're Atlas. - Atlas? Never. - My home, my rules. - I like your game. My grandpa gave it to me. He was a huge Monarcas fan. He'd always take me to games. - Not anymore? - No, he died. Would you like to go back? Yes, I'd love to. Want to see my Borrego Villa jersey? Yes! Look, it was my first jersey. - It's really cool. - Right? Can I see it? My grandpa got it for me. It was my first time at the stadium. I was five. I miss him. One, two. One, two. Score! You're great, honey. - Okay. Hey. - Yes? Do you want to be part of your school's team? I don't know. If you get in, you can quit ballet. - Really? - Really. - Yes! - Deal? Okay. Let's practice your kick to make it go through there. Wait. Focus. You know how to aim it. "Emma gets ready. She's going to kick it." Kick. Almost, honey! You almost did it! Focus. Go wide, girl. Go wide. Move over here. Coach, can I be part of the team? - Can you play? - Yes, Dad is teaching me. Your dad? So show me. Come here, Sofi. Emma is going to try out for the team. Be nice to her and be good teammates, okay? - Okay? - Yes. Whatever. Not "whatever," "yes, sir." Let's play. Come on! Take the ball! Go back to the nunnery, baby Emma. Come on, come on! Come on, run! Let's go! Come on! You can do it! Goal! The coach said I was great. But I can be better. Last season, the team lost. It hasn't won a title in years. Okay, well, the question is... Are you in? Yes! My little soccer player! Thanks for letting me play. And for sending me Andrés. Amen. - Hi, honey. - Hi, Dad. Look what I've got. I don't know what it is. A friend of mine came by this morning and gave me three tickets for the Monarcas game! Really? That's so cool! One for me, one for you and another one for your friend, what's his name? Andrés? Come on! Careful. Excuse us. Sorry. Yes, yes! - Come on! - Pass the ball! Pass the ball! - Come on. - Take it! Go! Come on! - Let's go! - Pass the ball! Pass the ball! No! No! Unbelievable. What is he doing? Come on! Kick it! Kick it! - Yes. - Come on. Go! Yes, keep going. I can't believe it! He was right there! - It was just him. - That's right. I think we're going to lose. No, honey. Never lose hope. - Cheer up! - It's all about faith. Anything is possible if you believe with all your heart. Your heart. That's it! Heart. Heart. Goal! Goal! Goal! I told you! He's a genius! Go through the tire. Please. Yeah! - Can I have two sodas? - What flavor? Strawberry for me. What about you? Orange. Don't let him steal. Don't let him steal. Don't let him steal. - Thanks. - And a chocolate bar. - How much is it? - That's okay. Thanks. Thanks. I'm Saint Emma's mom. Is it true that Saint Emma stopped the Monarcas curse? Yes, she saved the entire team. - She turned them into champions. - Yes. Emma. Ready for the game tomorrow? - What? - The game. Yeah. Wake up, your sisters are a mess. INTER SCHOOL TOURNAMENT Yeah, there you go, go on. Go, go. Kick it! Go, go! Come on, girl! YOU CAN DO IT! Bite it, bite it! Honey! I love you! I want to play. I want to play. I want to play. I want to play. I want to play. Make way! - Move, move. Show me. - You'll be okay. - It hurts! - Where? - Here! - Move it up and down. Here? Yes! It's not broken. Are you sure? - Yes. - Come on. Emma! Get in! Don't move it, stay there. Keep calm. Emma, this is a sport, but we play with our heart. - Okay? - Okay. Do it, do it! Steal the ball! Great job, honey! You were amazing! Emma. Come on. Come on, let's play! Emma. You should have seen her. I think we should get her private lessons. Or maybe not. Maybe... Maybe, if we wait a few years, Morelia will hire her. - Yes, I think so. - First she should finish school. It's amazing, she's better than Hugo Sánchez. No, no, no. So much better. - You're exaggerating. - She's like a tiny Maradona. - You're crazy. - Maradona was tiny too. We are really so happy... - Hey... - Yes? Do you still want to transform yourself into a saint? It's not a transformation, Dad. What I mean is... You don't want to cut your head off or rip your eyes out or burn your hair off, right? I'm not crazy. That's true. Just in case, do you pinky promise? - I promise, Dad. - Pinky promise, okay? - Yes! - Okay. So we're okay. This is a great example of an efficient center-forward... "Future Morelia stars". Sometimes I want to pinch the kids in class. And I've also been thinking... Father Julio, we need to talk. Emma, can't you see I'm busy? Mother Betty is in confession. Didn't you say you didn't like soccer? No, I don't, and you can't interrupt confession. Lying is bad. Very bad. You know that. Emma, I didn't lie. And what is this? I can explain. Just wait outside. I'll be right out. Something bad is going to happen to you. - Sorry, Mother. - It's okay, Father. I also want to pinch the parents. Where did you get that, Emma? It's my dad's. Father, were you a soccer player? I was. I even played for the Monarcas for a while. Everyone said I had a great future ahead of me. But it didn't go as planned. My knee was destroyed. I went to a lot of doctors. But they all said I'd never play again. I never played again. But I found my calling. So you're a Monarcas fan too? No, not anymore. - It makes no sense. - I think it does. Dad, can we bring Father Julio to a game? No! And Felipe appears! He used his hands... Rafa Márquez on defense... Atlas at least seems to try to put pressure... Can you pray for him to miss? I don't know. I don't want something bad to happen to him. True, it's like praying for something bad. I know! Pray for the goalie to catch it. That's a good thing. Okay. Go ahead. - He caught it! - Yeah! He caught it. He did? I think she has a gift. - Giraffe, I'm talking to you. - What? - Nothing. You scared me. - Don't be ridiculous. I was saying that I think she has a gift. Both times she prayed to stop a goal, it worked. It's like... That's normal. - I disagree. - Dad? Can Father Julio come to a game with us? I guess. If he wants to. - He doesn't. - What then? He has to come. Mom, your flower looks pretty. Thanks, honey. And you promised. Bye. Exactly... I wish you all a great day! We can get some gazpacho and a beer, right? Gazpacho, yes, I'd love to. But I don't drink beer. Right. - Why did you invite the priest? - He's cool. - But he's a priest. - He used to play soccer. - That's hard to believe. - No, it isn't. Don't invite the nuns. Come on! That way. Yes, good! What is it, Father? - Nothing, Emma, nothing. - Defense! Careful! No! It's okay, it's okay! You can do it, guys! Come on! Move, move! What is it, honey? Last time when we were losing, you still supported the team. Remember that the key is to fight till the end. Okay? Cheer up. Give us a goal. Give us a goal. Emma, what are you doing? Give us a goal. Give us a goal. Give us a goal. - Goal! - Goal! Goal! Goal! I think I'm a saint already. How do I know if I'm a saint? Did you do your Spanish homework? - Yes. - It was easy, right? Can I see? Sure. Look. It's good. But you only wrote sentences about Morelia. - But it's done, right? - You're right. Thanks for helping out these past few days. You thought I didn't know, right? Did you do it to become a saint? I did. But you don't like the idea at all, right? - I like everything you do. - Why don't you like soccer? It's not that I don't like it. What then? When I was your age, I wanted to play soccer. But my dad and my brothers only mocked me. They said soccer wasn't for girls. - But that's not true. - I know, but I believed it. You know? To succeed in life you need to believe in yourself. I'd like to go watch you play. Okay? Come here, Baby Bear. Let's go, honey! Come on! Yes! Come on, honey, don't stop. Yes, Baby Bear, you can do it! Go, girls! I'm impressed. You were great, honey. Your passes were great and you scored a goal! - Can you teach me? - I can. There's Emma. Her goal was amazing. Come here. I love you so much. - I love you more. - I love you more. Let's go, I don't want your dad to be destroyed by the babies. Emma, I'm having a pajama party. You can come if you want. Yes, of course. Thanks! - Bye. - Bye. So the girl's dad finds her, gets a knife and cuts her head off. There was blood everywhere. But at least the curse was over. - Where did you hear that? - In a film. - Can I comb your hair, Sofía? - Okay. - You're so cool. - Thanks. Is it bad to lie to people to get them to like you? You know it is, Emma. But if I tell Sofía and Andrés that I still want to be a saint, they won't want to be my friends. Sometimes we have to face our fears. Like you and soccer? Yes. Look, Emma. I really appreciate the invitation. You made me realize I was lying to myself. Did you see what happened? What? The miracle. I prayed for a goal and it happened. Emma, a player scoring a goal is not a miracle. But thanks to soccer, Andrés is starting to have faith. And he's becoming a better kid every day. That's great, but it's not a miracle. If Andrés decides to have faith, it's his choice. Father, sometimes your lack of faith shocks me. Andrés? Did you enjoy the game? The other day you mean? Yes, it was good. I screwed up. Did you see what I did? What? - I made them score a goal. - Right, you started praying. - So? - It was weird. Do you think that was a miracle? No, there is no such thing. What's taking so long? Look, I prayed a lot for my grandpa to survive. But he died. So miracles are not real. Yes, they are. I don't want to believe in God or anything else. If you can't respect that, we can't be friends. Baby Bear, want to play? Your sisters are asleep. No, I don't feel like it. What's wrong? Are you sick? Andrés doesn't want to be my friend. Why, honey? What happened? What happened? Give me your hand. Mother, why are you tearing that up? We found out Saint Emma was no saint. She ate stolen candy. She wasted her time with soccer. And her prayers got a teammate hurt. That's terrible. She didn't even get Andrés to have faith. Did she end the curse on the Monarcas? Her miracles were insignificant. Very simple ones. Good morning. Quiet! Good morning. Good morning, Mother Betty. - Ready for today's activities? - Yeah! Let's get ready for our morning prayers. Take a deep breath. And repeat after me. - "I offer you, Lord..." - "I offer you, Lord..." - "All my thoughts..." - "All my thoughts..." - "My words and actions today..." - "My words and actions today..." Andrés, what are you doing? Hey, where's Andrés? Where's Andrés? They caught him drawing a mustache on a saint. I think they're taking him to the dungeon. I heard that dungeons make your skin fall off like snakes. - There are no dungeons here. - Emma, say goodbye to your pal. Did you know he was bad? I have work to do. See you later. Listen... Did you really draw a mustache on Mary? - Yes. - Why? I guess it seemed fun. Did they scold you? Sort of. My parents are sending me to boarding school. Hi, Emma. - You won't talk to me? - No. Why not? It's your fault Andrés is gone. My fault? I wasn't the one who drew a mustache on a saint. But you told on him with the Mother Superior. You think it's better for Andrés to pretend nothing's wrong? Yes. Emma. Andrés may not believe like us, but he must show some respect. I disagree. Honey, come on. We can't be late for the game. I don't want to go. Can I stay? - Are you sad about Andrés? - Yes. Let's go watch the game. Maybe it'll cheer you up. I doubt it. I think it will. It's the round of 16. We have to support our team. Go team! Go Morelia! No, thanks. Emma, what is it? Focus. Come on, nun. Do you want to play? Goal! Where are you going? Are you leaving? I'm sorry, it's my fault you got hurt. - But you love soccer... - Not anymore. - I get you miss Andrés, but... - You don't get anything! Honey, are you coming? Half-time is over! You're both cute. Honey, the team needs you. Come here! Two friendly matches. We'll see. Edu Vargas gets the ball. Valencia is up 2 to 1. Valencia moves and... Scores! Goal! Don't look at me like that. I can't help it. Are you okay? I love you, honey. Hi, Father. Well, well, I'm glad you're speaking to me again. - I have a question. - Okay. Does God make mistakes? Why do you ask? First, He sends me a message telling me to be a saint. And then, through you, He talks to me about miracles. Well... The point is that everything went wrong. Fer got hurt. Andrés has no faith. But Emma... You know? Before your first communion, you had no friends. Now, I don't have them either. Andrés is your friend, right? Even if he's far away. You managed to be a good friend even to Sofía. And I'm sure that all your work to become a saint made your parents think a lot, and the rest of us too. Emma, you learned to respect others. To help others selflessly. That's your miracle, Emma. You learned to love. - Hi, honey. - Hi, Mom. - How are you? - Okay. Hi. There's an email for you. Do you want to know who wrote it? Yes? Guess. It starts with... - Andrés? - Yes. Hi, Emma. My new school isn't too bad. At least there are no nuns or stupid rules. I made a lot of friends. Kids are nice here. It's very fun. Fight! Fight! Fight! You have no idea. We play all the time. I never thought it'd be like this. I'm so sorry you can't be a saint because of me. But I can't believe in God. I'm sorry. I just can't. Hi, Dad. I wanted to ask if you can get tickets for us. - You like soccer again? - Well, I think I do. - You should have said so before. - Why? Because it's the finals. The finals? We're in the finals? Of course we are! We're a great team. Andrés! - Come on! - Go, Morelia! Come on! That player is so bad. Do something, priest. Ask for help, please! - That's not how it works. - Please! Have faith. Have faith. Come on, guys! - Come on, Borrego Villa! - Go, Morelia! Morelia! Come on! That was a foul! Penalty! Penalty! That's a penalty! - It's a penalty! Yeah! - Penalty! - Emma, you're not praying? - There's no need. Goal! Goal! Goal! Go Monarcas! Dear Andrés, things changed since the last time we met. The championship is in two weeks. You are playing fine, you have good technique... Father Julio is the new coach for the national priest team. They're playing at the Vatican World Cup. Believe it or not, Andrés knocked five nuns down. You became a legend. It's true. I saw it. Mother Betty and Coach Sebas disappeared at the same time after our championship. So Dad is coaching our team. Yes! Well done! And now... Yes! He and Mom are experts at raising three daughters now. There you go. My mom's love for soccer grows every day. All of us watch the game together on weekends. It's a lot of fun. My team is in the finals now. And we got there without any help. We won because we had faith in ourselves. Oh, I almost forgot! My mom finished her comic book. And she taught me to never stop going after your dreams. I miss you. I'll write again soon. I promise to never forget you. - Kick it! - Use the left leg! Watch out! I loved that game. Me too. Hey, Emma. I can't believe in God, but I believe in you. To my mother, my wife and my daughters.
