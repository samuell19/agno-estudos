Hi, Lorenzo. -How was your day? -Perfect! -Guess what I made for lunch? -Chilaquiles! You're home! I'm home. Oh, Igor! Look... Let's go to the movies, my treat. Really? I'll shower and we'll go. Get ready. Lorenzo, honey, your mom's here. Hey, ask Lorenzo to tell you about the festival. What do you say? Thank you, Bertha. Thank you. How did it go? You have to make me a lion costume. I'll make you the best costume of all. You'll see! What are you going to make it with? With fur. The really fluffy kind. Hey, mom... Can I call dad to tell him? -Yes, if you want to. -Yes, I do. Miss, a collect call. With whomever answers, Sandro, I'm putting Lorenzo on. Hi, dad! Hi there, kiddo. How are you? Fine. Guess what? I'm going to recite a poem in the spring festival. - It's called "Lady Springtime" - That's great! And I'll be wearing a costume. Guess as what? -A little mouse? -No. -A little monkey? -No! -A little rabbit? -No! -Well tell me! -A lion! I said that. No you didn't, cheater! When will you come see me? Really? Let me tell mom. Mom! Dad asks if I can visit him. Can I? Mom! - I think she's mad again. - That's news! -Good night, honey. -Good night. Lorenzo, just look at this mess. It's always the same thing. It's a never-ending story. How hard is it to put your toys away? That's all I ask. Shoes and clothing tossed all around! Would it be so hard? Tell me! What do you want? Open the door What do you want? Open the door. Are you smoking again? Yes, go to bed. But it stinks. Lorenzo, go to bed. Go to bed, I said! Good morning! Morning. Igor, don't forget the rent money, please. Of course. Here. And what I lent you the other day, too, please. Did you get paid? Yes, I'll leave you that, too. Thanks. Thank you. Guess what? I'm thinking of starting a group saving plan. It doesn't take much time and lots of people join. It's me, Maria. Flora. -Thank you. -Not at all. -I'll get your money. -Sure. Thanks. Come in. No, thanks. I still have a lot of clothes to do. Did you know the Venezuelans left? You don't say. When? I don't know. The other day I walked by and saw the apartment empty. It must have been over the parking space. I guess. Yeah. They were really mean. Come in. No, thanks. Don't you want to come with me while I wash? No, no. It's too cold. And then she told me: Really, Lola, it looks like you did it on purpose. Well, with a boss like that! -The thing is you never know. -Oh, you are bad! Really! If the boss keeps quiet, won't breathe a word. - What's your name? - Pina. And you? Igor. Let's go to a hotel. What time do you get off work? I'll wait for you. At six. But I can't today. I have to pick up my son. Let him wait. I can send him away on Saturday. -I can't on the weekend. -Why? My wife. Good afternoon. I'm going to make a deposit. Look what I made for you, honey. Thanks, mom. -Are they good? -Yes, mom. I'm glad. -Are you sad? -No. Why? You look sad. Wouldn't you like me to have a new friend? A boyfriend ? Did you meet someone? No, but if I did. What about dad? Your dad and I aren't together anymore. You're always mean to him. That's not true. You never tell him you love him. Your dad and I are good friends. Liar! You hate him! That's why he never comes. That's enough. We weren't talking about your dad. I asked you something else. That's enough! We weren't talking about you dad. I don't want you to have a boyfriend. I don't, I don't, I don't! But I do! I do, I do, I do! You're just doing it to bother me. You hate me, too! Yes, I do hate you. Because you make me feel old! You look awful with all that makeup. I'm embarrassed when you drop me off at school. Shut up, shut up, shut up! Take that, and that, and that! Are you really embarrassed? Yes! I can't hate you, I'm your mommy. You're home! I'm home. Guess what? Something good happened today. Mr. Valdez finally paid me. That's good. Do you want to go to the movies? My treat. Don't you want to go out? Sure, if you want. Are you mad at me? Why would I be mad at you? Are you tired? We don't have to go out. We can stay home. I'm sorry... It's ok. No problem. I have a million things to do anyway. I'm sorry! Forgive me, Igor! I got distracted, sorry! Forgive me! It's ok, it's ok. I'll get the ointment. I'm such a fool, such a fool! Honey, I have to go out for a while. Your aunt Carmen called. She has a problem. I won't be long. Are you hungry? Are you sure? My number is on the fridge. Don't open to anyone, please. What's the matter, honey ? Have a sandwich. There's bread, butter, ham and cheese. Look again. Oh, honey. But I have to go meet your aunt. I'm sorry. I didn't have anyone to leave my son with. I was able to get away from my wife and get the hotel room. And wait for three hours like an idiot. We can meet tonight. I'm going for a walk. Ok. Do you want to come? Sure. Do you have coffee? Two, please. Look. It's almost healed. Did it hurt a lot? A lot. But it's better now. Good. They want me to go to work at this hour. They're crazy. Why couldn't we be millionaires, honey ? Oh, please. Please, Igor. -It's 85 pesos. -85! That's outrageous! Everything is so expensive, what can I do? You can lower the price. Three pieces of junk for 85 pesos! There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Let me give you a bag. Thank you. This just came in. Feel the texture. And how much is it? That one is 180 pesos a meter. 180 pesos? That's robbery! But it's imported. How about this one? This is a little cheaper. It costs 125 a meter. I need two of this and one of this. How much is that? 1, 2... that will be 430. 430 pesos? That's robbery! I don't know if I have 430 pesos on me. But, ma'am... Lorenzo, tell your teacher to stop making up ways to waste money. She knows how expensive everything is. No, I don't have 430 pesos. Lorenzo... Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Mom! Where were you? Why did you leave, Lorenzo? Oh Lady Springtime... Will my love ever bloom? If your love is sincere... ...all your blossoms I will rear. See the tulips running free! And the daisies dancing on and on. The violets jump and cheer... Because... Because the chains have broken clear. Oh, Lady Springtime... A thousand colors she presents. A kind friend in her you'll find... ...if your love is true at heart. The grass of green will smile. The bright sky is a blue embrace. The yellow sun does shine. And your heart in red will beat on. Oh, Lady Springtime... Will my love ever bloom? If your love is sincere ... all your blossoms I will rear. See the tulips running free! And the daisies dancing on and on. The violets jump and cheer... Why didn't you learn it at home? The festival is almost here. It's ok. Because the chains have broken clear. See the tulips running free! And the daisies dancing on and on. The violets jump and cheer... Lorenzo... Lorenzo! Good afternoon. -Yes. -Mr. Igor Pascual ? That's me. We're from Megaofi. Yes. Come In. What did you buy ? Is it a washing machine? What is it? It's a photocopier. Sign this, please. On both pages. This is for you. Thank you. Excuse us. Why did you buy it? Are you starting a business? Where did you get the money? Igor? -Where did you qet the money? -I closed the account. And my money? How much did it cost? Why did you buy it? Are you starting a business? What about my money? How much did it cost? Igor! Answer me! Why did you buy it? Why did you buy it? Why did you buy it? We have to return it. No, fuck! I don't get it. I don't. Why did he do it? He isn't saying anything. He keeps silent. This will help you feel better. Careful. Lorenzo. Lorenzo, honey. Look, I bought you something. -Do you like it? -Why did you throw them all away? Oh, son, they were really old. Besides, you couldn't even walk in here. I liked them. But I'm going to buy you a lot more. This is the first of many more. You'll see. But they were mine. I thought you would be glad to have new toys. Look. Isn't it nice? Can we go to park to play? Of course we can. We'll go this weekend. Ok? Yes, mom. Thanks. You're very welcome. I love you so much. I know. -30 pesos, please. -Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a moment. Pages 15 to 40, please. Two... exactly. -Place your hand here. -Here ? Exactly. Put it this way. Can I have a towel, please? Yes, that's very good. Thank you. It's going to be great for the festival. That's right. The sun should smile more. You're seeing someone, aren't you? That's why you bought the machine. So you could leave me. How can you think that? Damn it! Or is it because we can't have children? That's it, isn't it? No, I know. You want me to get mad. To leave. So you can do as you please, like you used to. You are so small, Igor. You didn't give me children, but I have you. Good evening. What's do you want, Igor? Is Flora here? Flora? Where did she go? I don't know. Didn't she come here? Today ? Not today. If you see her... ..tell her I am looking for her. Yeah. Thanks. The car is skidding! We lost control! We're going to die! I don't want to die! We're going to die! Mom, I lost my car. The new one? Yes. Really? Where? Over there. Watch my purse. Over here? Yes. Where were you? Over there! Where? There! Are you sure you brought it? Yes, mom! Over there. I didn't know how to turn it on. A bunch of people came. Especially in the morning. But in the afternoon I didn't open the door. You could have made good money. It's a shame. I finished in Miravalle. Now I have to go south of the city. Did you see the shirts ? I haven't ironed for a long time. Don't cry. I don't like to see you like this. To cheer you up, you used to like to make love. Put on your coat. Do you want a chip? Thanks. Lupe's daughter ran off with her boyfriend. You don't say. She was about to graduate from... ...high school. A toy for your girlfriend... I hope she doesn't get pregnant. Let's dance. Come on. Thanks, mom. What happened to the car? I lost it in the park, mom. Tell me the truth. I lost it in the park. Are they good? -Yes, mom. -I'm glad. You have to eat them all. But they're so many. Don't start, please. Eat them all and don't argue. I don't want... You're out of hand! I spent hours preparing this crap and now you don't want anymore! I'm fed up! What more can I do to please you? I give you everything and you whine and whine and whine! You're not getting up until you finish! I dont want anymore. Eat them. Eat them! No. Open your mouth. Open your mouth! Swallow it. Swallow it! CHECK TONER. Lorenzo... I have a surprise for you. Come! It's very nice. Do you like it? Yes. Where did you buy it? What do you mean? I made it for you. Look... these are the paws. The claws go here. And this is the mane. I really like it. Why so serious? Because... I called dad. Why? He's worried about me. He's coming to pick me up tomorrow. What about school? And the festival? I'm glad you called him. Really? It will be good for all of us, you'll see. -You're not mad at me? -No, I'm not mad. Are you going to tell him? No... Why should I? He didn't tell me that he spent my money. No, he didn't. So I won't. But... I need your help. What do you need? Your van. I'm going to my sister in law's and she lives in San Cosme. Movers are too expensive. Ok, you can count on me. Thanks a lot. Do you think it could be tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'm really in a hurry. Yes, I guess so. Thanks. Why did he spend all my money ? Flora... It's your right. Yes, What else goes on this garland? A butterfly. The rain is too long. Which one? This one? Did you glue it? I can make it higher. Otherwise the kids will bump Into it. Can I wear it? Come here. Forgive me. I wish I were a better mom... Dad's here! I love you very much, honey. Me, too. -Mind your dad, ok? -Yes, mom. And take care. Come here. You could have let me know. I have a lot of work. Yes, but you can't make these decisions on your own. We'll talk later. Can you manage? The blue one fits here. I'll open for the rest. -How does this work ? -There's a knack to it. Let's go, let's go, Maria. Come on. You open the door and I'll roll up the cords. How are we going to get it down, Flora?
