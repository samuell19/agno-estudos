Who even are you? You're such a mystery boy. Show us your hands. Get off my back. I ain't do nothing. I can't... Can't breathe. I can't... Let's go! Mm. What's up? Yo, let's smoke. Come on. So you got no smokes? - Can I get one from you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks, brother. Come on, now. Ah, don't worry about the riff-raff, bro. Come on. What was his problem? You don't know about Cleme, at Crane Lake? Dude, come here. Bro, so Crane Lake, it got its name from this girl Cleme Crane. She vanished near it. Tim was the sole witness. He was a kid when it happened. Him and his mom went to the cops saying that she got abducted and shit. Said they saw all these strange lights and creatures in the sky. My grandpa said it was on the news for a week. Man, stop playing, bro. Come on. That did not happen. Hello? Who's there? Get it up! Jesus. Hey, man, you can take whatever you want, man. - Ah, come on, man. - Ah! Really? Man, what are you doing here? You know I gotta mess with my girl's little bro. My mom sent me to get food if that matters. Yeah. - I see. - Thank you. Okay. Man. It's popping up, man. Everywhere. You're coming to the party tomorrow, right? Hmm? Maybe. Come on. You have to come. Is Brock gonna be there? Brock? You don't gotta worry about him. I ain't afraid of him. I know. Who even are you? You're such a mystery boy. - What did you- - Oh, my god. They just keep falling out of my hand. - Come on! - Don't know what, - I can't stop! - It is my job! - It just keeps happening! - Chill out! Yo. Yo! Hey! Come on! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Whoa. Whoa. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Come on, hey. I didn't even- - Didn't have to move it like that. Come on, now. Hey! Come on, then. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. No, boy, boy, if you don't open this door, I'm gonna smack you so hard. - Open the door! - Just give me a minute! Boy, you need to check your attitude 'cause this ain't it. And what, are you even shaving peach fuzz? You're bugging. Get. Hey, damn, man. Hey, look, I was starting first. - Yo, I'm almost done. - And now, you're done. So how'd you sleep last night? You have any more nightmares? You know they come and go. You know that. Okay. You know, just asking. Anyways, are you coming to the party? Amira's gonna be there. Mm, I mean... Just say yes. I guess I'll check it out. All right? Good. All right, how do I look? Man, you look fine, man. Stop tripping. We in the country now. Hurry all this up. We can't be late. You're always late. And you're always slow. Man, stop rushing me, man. Get outta here. Damn. Nice. - Morning, baby. - Morning, Mom. What you want, Gabbi? What you want? What you want? What you want? What you running here for? What you running here for? - Nothing! - What you running here for? What you running here for? What you want? What do you want? What do you want? You want a dollar? - Yeah! - Want a dollar? - Want a dollar? - Yes! I know, I know. I did again. Aww, man, come on. You got it, all right? Outta control. Good morning. Brown residence. Oh, hi. Listen, can we talk about this later? Now's not a good time. Listen, I can't do this with you right now. I know you're sorry, but I need more time. I... Don. Yeah, hi. Where do you go? I don't know. Nowhere. Just thinking. Well, I hope you let some of us in someday. Let us see that kingdom of yours. Jay, all of this, is out of love. We really want what's best for you kids. But what about you, Mom? Why do you keep going back to him? Life is complicated, Jay. People can learn from their mistakes. Mom. Shoot! Start the car! I already did that. Ah. All right, now, lady killer. My man of the house now, huh? Just a few more classes and I'll be done. And please, please be nice to Aunt Suzy. It's a blessing she even took us in, right? Mom. I love you. I love you too, boy. A very unusual situation here. What we can tell so far is that this is going to be very fast moving storm. We're talking heavy rains, high winds- Even the potential for some thunderstorms. Don't be late for school. And in other news, Pentagon, today, released footage of US Navy pilots chasing, what they're calling, a UFO. No. Thank you for blessing us with your presence, Mr. Brown. Sleep well? Would you be a dear and diagram our DNA structure molecule? Jaylen Brown to the principal's office. Jaylen Brown to the principal's office. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to run into you. - Those- - Mm-hmm. Those aren't my cigarettes. Those are somebody else's. - My fault. - There you are, Mr. Brown. Ah, Sheriff. Thank you again for coming in this fine morning. Kids always love your visits. Any time, Patsy. So, shall we? Got another call this morning about your behavioral issues. Meet you guys at the party? Did we decide what we're wearing? I was just thinking of going as ghost, honestly. Okay. Boy, are you going to church? Are you okay? I'm Gucci. All right, is a suit supposed to be Gucci? The pastor? Are you doing fabulous pastor goes to church? Unless that's what you're going for, man, fantastic, you did it. All right, Jay, listen. I know people are different out here, but if you give them a chance, some actually might surprise you. Look, it's weak up here, sis. Come on, don't you find it strange that we the only black folks in town? Jay. Look, sometimes, I just wanna leave and never come back. You're the reason we up here, Jay. So we might as well have fun while we're here. I mean, Don is still our stepdad no matter how things went down. But, look at where we are, though. This is not the worst place on Earth. We're surrounded by a beautiful lake, on a boat, with swans and we're going to a party. Like, what? Like, bro. Let's take some shots, let's have fun, and hopefully, by the end of the night, I can get a smile on your face. Okay? Can I get a okay? - Aight. - Okay? - Okay. - Can I get a, like, a little happier than that? Yeah, aight. Yeah, aight! What, what! Yeah. Cheers. Hey, yo, bro. Whoa, yo. It's a pastor, bro. Brock, what are you even supposed to be? We're joking, Simone. Come on. Hey, wait. Yo, who invited you, though? - Whoa, chill out. - Huh? He's my brother. He's with me. All right. Excuse me, honeys. Sorry, ladies. - Boo! - Shit. Hoo! You are too easy. Damn. - Ha ha. - Always scaring people. I know. - Let me guess. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. KKK? Nah, Goofy, damn. I am your friendly ghost. You might look better in the flesh. Yeah, fair enough. Wow. That ghost didn't do you no justice. Thank you. You have some good moves, actually. Really? Okay. It's a little strong. I think it's too much for the people around here- - Oh, exactly. - But I liked it. Yo, Amira, what are you doing with this kid? - Brock, I'm just hanging out. - Yo, hey, come on. - Let's go, let's go. - No, no. - We're going, we're going. - Brock, stop. Let go of me. We're not together anymore. - What? - What the fuck are you gonna do, huh? - Come on. - You don't want me like that. Let's get outta here. Come on. Outta my way. Hey, where y'all going? None of your business. - Jerk! - You're strong, woman. Why you looking so scared, though? Hold on. You gotta just give it a little jiggle. Woo! Strong. - Hmm? - Wow. This is crazy. Hey, have you heard the story about Crane Lake? Who told you about that? Trev. - Trev. - Mm-hmm. Oh, Trev. So I've always been curious, why'd you guys move here of all places? Hmm. Me and my stepdad Don, we got into it. And now we're stuck out here. What happened? My mom just keeps going back to him. It's like an addiction. Just keeps hitting her, hitting her. Man, I just wanted to kill him. Hey. It's okay. Really, it's okay. I'll never forget the look in her eyes. What about you, though? What keeps you here? Honestly, it's been rough for me. When they send you back into the system, being passed from family to family, it's exhausting. Well, why do you pretend like it's okay? Sometimes, you just gotta make the best of a bad situation. And sometimes, help will come when you least expect it. We have to believe that things will work out for the better. It could be worse. A lot worse, Jay. Believe me. You're perfect. It's true. Why don't just leave town together? Why don't we just jump in? Jump in? Yeah. Jump in what? The water. Wait. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. Come on. - Right now? - Come on! - Right now? - Yes! What are you doing? I'm jumping in. - Come on. - Okay, if I gotta go alone, I'm gonna go alone. - Wait, please- - You're not coming with me? - What? - Here I go. Wait! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! It's so cold! Why did you let me do this?! Girl, you're crazy. Was it worth it? No! Oh, my god, it's so cold! Come on. - Oh, thank you. - Of course. Holy shit. Come on, let's go. Wait. Shit. My earring. What? Come on, we'll get that later. - Come on, let's go. - No, my grandma got them for me. I'm going back to look. Come on, hurry up. - Come on. - Where is it? Amira! Amira! Amira! Where are you?! Amira! Amira! Amira?! Amira! Amira?! Amira?! Amira! Yo, Jay! Get in! Come on! Get in! Get in. The party got busted. We need to get outta here. Yo, man, did you see Amira? Bro, what happened? I don't know where Amira is. What you mean you don't know where Amira is? I don't know. You're bleeding. She probably ran home like everyone else. Look, man, look, listen. - Trev, I don't- - Shit! Shit! We'll be all right, okay? Just put this on. Cover your face. License and registration. How's it going, Dad? Excuse me? I'm sorry, sir. How about that license? I heard there was some party up at the Johnsons' place, but you boys wouldn't know anything about that, now would you? Are you okay, son? Yes, sir. I want the both of you to go straight home. Straight home, Trevor. We'll talk about this later. Get that tail light fixed! Hey, I'm sure she's fine. All right? I'll see you tomorrow. Why don't we just jump in? Who even are you? You're such a mystery- You have reached the voice mailbox- - Oh, shit. You have reached the voice mailbox of- - Amira! Amira! During the Reconstruction period, the black race was given ample opportunities to earn their place as equal citizens in society. While the Fourteenth Amendment states that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, it quickly became evident that the black race was not yet civilized enough to be treated as equals. The system of segregation was actually quite beneficial. Jaylen Brown, please report to the principal's office, immediately. Jaylen Brown, to the principal's office, immediately. Many prestigious universities and organizations might never have existed. Ideally, in this situation, we would wait for your mom before having this type of meeting. But given your history, we've decided to expedite the process. There was a party last night at the Johnsons' lake house. Did you attend? Please be honest with us. Yeah, I was there. And your classmate, Miss Amira Woods, was she there? Did you leave the party together? Because nobody has seen her since last night. Jaylen, Amira Woods is missing. Do you wanna tell us what happened? I don't know. I came out the water and she was gone. Look, we need to find her. Find anything? Just this. I want you guys just sweep this entire area from top to bottom. To listen to your messages, press 1. Hey, boy, the school called. What's going on, Jaylen? Call me. So Jerry says you should take the rest of the day off. Okay. It's a small town, bro. Word gets around, news travels fast. What happened last night? They said you, I mean... Dude, my pops is asking me questions about Amira. He's asking about the party. What happened down by the lake? Do you have any idea where she is? Jay, I'm trying to help you. You gotta understand that. I don't know, man. I don't know! Look, we were down by the lake and a storm rolled in, but we dipped out. But Amira, she dropped her earring, so we went back, but I slipped and... Before I blacked out, I saw these crazy blue lights, and then she was gone. What, like lightning? No, like, she was there and then she was gone. Jay, come on, man. Jay, I told you about Tim and Clemmie Crane. You're gonna try to convince me with the same story? Man, why would I lie about that? You know you're my boy. You can trust me. Just tell me what really happened. Man, I know what I saw! This is exactly why people don't trust you guys. I thought you were different. No, forget it, man. Jay! Jay, I didn't mean it like... Excuse me. How may I help you, young man? I need some help looking for some articles. Well, just wait by the desk. I'll be right down. What articles? The Clemmie Crane disappearance? Hmm. Um. Ah. Follow me. I'll show you the news archives. Yup. Here you go. Thank you. Will that be all, young man? It's closing time. Have a good night. Yes, have a blessed evening, young man. Give me one reason I shouldn't crack your skull. Look, I'm sorry, sir, I- - You trespassing. - I was- - Who the hell are you? Look, my friend is missing. Please, I need your help. Why'd you come here? Call me a liar?! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please, please. Look, I have no where else to turn. Look, I saw something, man. It sounds crazy. You were there. Did you see what happened? Did you see what really happened to Clemmie Crane? That ain't got nothing - to do with you! - Whoa! But it does! She was right there, then these crazy lights struck. And then she was gone. Come on. I'll show you something. Well, come on. Sit there. What'd you say your name was again, son? Jaylen. You really wanna find out what happened to your girlfriend? Come on. You know, I should be getting home, man. Ah, jeez, I'm not the boogeyman. Come on! Whoa. What is all this? Hey, so all these people... Like a girlfriend. I've been searching for proof all these years. Yeah, but why didn't the cops get involved? Because this is way bigger than the cops and you and me. Come here. I'll show you something else. Why her? To save her. They came to reveal, and we have to redeem ourselves. Man, what are you even talking about? Look, when I was a young kid, I was birdwatching by the lake the day Clemmie Crane got abducted. I could hear her screams. Bill O'Hare was the sheriff back then, trying to rape that girl. Was all happening so fast, I could barely change my film roll. Clemmie got away from the sheriff. She ran into a dead end. - Help! - No one was around to help her. Help! Please. Help! That's when they came. Rain started to pour out of nowhere, then came the blue lights. And just like that, she was gone. That's when O'Hare realized I'd seen everything. He took my camera, my film, but he didn't get the roll in my pocket. Let me tell you something, son. That rabbit hole is deeper than you think, and you'd sooner lose yourself to forget that. You keep those. Maybe they'll do you some good. Direct descent requirements. The two-burn development phase to put Surveyor into parking orbit should be completed late in 1966. Going beyond the moon, the planetary program in 1965, saw successful completion of the Mariner Mars mission. - Shh, shh, shh. - The first attempt was unsuccessful due to a faulty shroud. About 30 days later, in November 1964, Mariner 4 was successfully launched with a redesigned, new shroud, on time for its historic 228-day journey to Mars. On its way, Mariner 4 gave us our first look at interplanetary space, between Earth and the orbit of Mars. It found it very much like that between Earth and Venus, with one big exception. A notable peak in the impact rate of cosmic dust activity was recorded on the monitors of the Mariner project. This, and other interplanetary experiments, returned almost 20 million such scientific measurements during the course of the flight. On the 307th day of flight, when it passed beyond effective range for data transmission, Mariner 4 was 191 million miles from Earth, a standing record. The picture data was stored on magnetic tape for later playback to Earth. Hello? Pops? And revealed the existence of an ionosphere. Picture information in digital form started to come in at 6:00 a.m. Pacific daylight time on July 15th, 1965. Converted to shades of- Always with the damn TV. Pops, get up. Goddamn Henry. Oh. Go on. Go on. Get outta here. Dumb sons of bitches are making a mess in my department. Where's my hooch? You're hiding it again, ain't ya? We have witnesses. We have enough evidence. I just need to find that boy. If you slowed down on that bottle, I wouldn't have to keep coming over here. Better book that boy soon. People are gonna be asking questions, about them. Pops, Jesus Christ. You're losing your goddamn mind. Ain't nothing up there. My whole team is sweeping the town, looking for that boy. As soon as we find him, all this nonsense will be over. I should've never taken your advice about this. Times are changing, Pops. This ain't the '60s no more. Oh, she's getting angry now, is she? I'm just trying not to make the same goddamn mistakes you did! I am trying to protect this family name. Isn't that what you wanted? Isn't that what you've always always wanted?! Don't be a goddamn pussy! Nobody gives a shit about those missing scum. They need to respect justice! Mm-hmm. All right. They need to respect our justice! I don't care if that black boy is innocent or guilty! You'll Code 11, or are you too chicken shit to put him away? The hell did you say to me? Do what I told you, or I'll have you replaced by tomorrow. Damn. Mariner 4 returned to reporting on interplanetary space. Who's in my house?! You make a move, and I'll put it between your eyes. And we hope for more good data when Mariner 4 again moves nearer to Earth in 1967. The Mariner mission answered many questions. Don't come back, you son of a bitch! Pop. Calm down, calm down. Calm yourself. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Has Jaylen ever done something like this before? Done something like what? What are you talking about? Did something happen? When's the last time you heard from him? We heard from him this morning. Why are you guys in my house? Why are you in my house? - Calm down, we're just- - No, I'm calm. We're just doing our job. - Calm down, ma'am. - I have rights! Hey! If you're looking for the bathroom, it's downstairs! To listen to your messages, press 1. Hey, baby, we're all worried. Look, where are you? I've been up all night. Call me? Mr. Brown, this is Deputy Wilson with the Mount Arrow Police Department. You're in a lot of trouble, son, so it'd be best if you came down to the station and turn yourself in. Jaylen, please come home. We'll figure this out together. I love you. Shit. - Woo! - Come on! Let's get him, Brock! Woo! What the fuck?! Get outta here! Get outta here! Yeah, okay. Why you running? Where is she?! Come on. - Where is she, huh? - I don't know, man! Hey! Hey! Go on! Get! Yo, yo, come on, we gotta go. Let's go! Come on! You all right, man? Come on, let's get out of here. You'll be all right. This is you. Coming up, friends and family gather to help canvas the area, as the search for Amira Woods expands. Police continue to gather evidence on a black male suspect. Where have you been? Where have you been? Excuse me, where have you been? I've been up all night worried sick! - Fuck, man. - Huh?! Did you slam the door on my face?! The cops raided my house! Your mom is still out there looking for you! What is going on?! Open the damn door! Leave me alone! Where have you been?! Look, you be respectful! Jaylen, open the door! - Open it! - Move! Move, Suzy. What did you do? Oh, you're not in the mood right now. - Jay. - Yeah? Don warned me about you! - Don warned me about you! - Don warned you about what?! - You're such a mess! - No. You are such a mess. - You know what, Suzy? - What? Your brother, he beat up my mom! - Oh, yeah? - Night after night after night! Well, you almost killed my brother! How do you think that makes me feel?! Huh?! - You need to calm down. - No, sis! I'm done with her shit! Oh, you're done with my shit? - I'm done with it! - Okay. You think I looked messed up?! Man, ask Simone what he did to my mom! Ask Gabbi what he did to my mom! No one deserves that! No one! And stop looking at me like I'm some sorta monster! - I ain't do nothing. - What did you do? - Go upstairs, go upstairs. - I ain't do nothing. What are you trying to do? - You need to lay down. - No, no, no, no, no. - Get my backpack. - Jay. - Get my backpack. - Why? Get it. I gotta show you something. Look, man, you might not believe me, but I'll tell you, I've been going all over town. There's something going on here. You ever heard that story about Clemmie Crane? Yes. All this is evidence from her disappearing. Jay. Jay, okay, slow down. - I don't understand what- - No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. I went to the library and I found these pictures. These pictures have her. It's like an abduction. It's like creatures in the sky, and then, like, taking people. Look, these disappearances, they're people disappearing. And they're trying to frame it on me. - What? - Amira's gone. Jay... - Amira is gone. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Creatures, Jay. - I'm serious. I'm serious. Look. - And Tim, Tim showed me this. - Okay, all right, all right. Jay, lay down. This is a lot to take in right now, and you need to get some rest. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Wait, wait, wait, please- - Jay, here, give me this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Take these peas. Give me this. - Give me- - No, but you see it, right? Oh, I see it, I see it. It's okay. It's okay. Man, do you believe me? Yeah. I believe you. This is insane, Jay. Simone. Simone? Simone. Why you looking so scared, though? Jay, you gotta get up right now. Put your shoes on. Get up right now. Hey, what's happening? What's going on? We just gotta get you outta here. Brock and those other boys... Here, you gotta go, right now. You need to go. No, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. - No, it's not. - I got this. - No, no, no. - No, no. - What?! - Listen to me. No, it's not okay. I don't wanna be talking to you through glass, Jay. What about you? What about Mom? Don't worry about us. You gotta go. Go, Jaylen. Just go! I meant Jaylen. - Jaylen is- - I saw him come home late, so I just wanna talk to him - for a second. - Oh, no, he hasn't come home. Is he okay? No, I saw him come home. - You did? - Yeah. Can you just open the door - real quick so I can talk- - You're just a little boy, and I see all you guys. - You, you, you. - Hey, don't worry about them. Go call your mom. - Call your mother. - Open the door, huh?! - All right. - Open the door! Hey! I'm calling the police on you. Dialing. Oh, okay. And it's ringing! You flip me off? Yeah. Nice mother you have. Hey, open the door! Hey! It's ringing! 911. What's your emergency? Hello? 911. What's your- Take this. It's money. I believe you. I do. Thank you. Get off me! All right, it's time. Let's go. All units, all units, BOLO on Jaylen Brown. I repeat, BOLO on Jaylen Brown. Show me your hands! - Get down on the ground! - Police! Stay still. Hands behind your head. Hello, you've reached the police department's voicemail. So that's your story, huh? That is what you're sticking with? Jaylen, we both know that you have a history of violence. So, I'm gonna ask you this one more time, what happened to Amira? - Go sit over there. - Could it be a bear? Uh-huh. Well, that's not our division. You'll have to call animal control. Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Excuse me! - Who are you here for? I'm looking for my son Jaylen Brown. No, he hasn't been charged yet. - File that, okay? - Huh? - What? - Yeah. Excuse me, I can't hear you. - Hi. - Hi. Where's my son? Like I said, charges have not been filed yet. So until then, could you please sit in the waiting area until I can get more information? Yeah, but how long is that going to be? What do you mean "more information"- - Please sit in the waiting area until I can get more information. Okay? Okay. Yeah, thank you for holding. Can you speak slower, please? Do you ever wonder, "Why me?" Man, every day. Do you realize the position you're putting me in? Hmm? What you're practically forcing me to do? Forcing you? Man, you're charging me for crime you know I didn't do. You think that badge protects you, but you can't hide forever. Come and get me! What does that have to do with my son? Well, if you calm down and let me talk, then I can explain. Sheriff, my son, what are the charges? Mrs. Brown, your son's going away for a long- - Mommy, I'm scared! - Hey, everyone remain calm. We have a generator. Sheriff, you better come see this. Jaylen. Jay.
