Ladies and gentlemen... ...we are now approaching another great symbol of this country... ...and one of the most famous places in Turkey... ...the Bosphorus Bridge, connecting Europe and Asia. In the last 2000 years... ...many nations wanted to control this special place... ...that was used for transportation between Europe and the Middle East. This bridge was opened in 1973. And as you will be able to see, it is always full of traffic. If you look further down, you will be able to see... ...the Sultan Mehmet Bridge... ...that was opened in 1988... ...after the city expanded even more. We are arriving to Uskudar... ...the Asian part of Istanbul. Please be careful when you leave the boat... ...and take all your belongings with you. When in Uskudar, walk along the promenade... ...and eat some of the fish our local fishermen bring in daily. Excuse me. Hasan. Hasan. Help! Help! Help! Hasan. Hasan. - Help. - What happened? Please help. Hasan. Hasan. Hasan. Here he is! Shalom, everybody! Well done, Eyal. Excellent job. - Thanks. - Champagne, anyone? Let's have a drink. A real celebrity. Give yourself a blow job. MASTER OF TERROR TERMINATED Not only in Israel... - Are you okay? - Yes. - You speak to Iris? - Yesterday. - And? - She sounds okay. Strange. She's not answering my calls. - Quiet, please. Cheers! - Cheers! Shouldrt we say something? Well... To Eyal, who loves his profession. Great job. - Anything to add, Menachem? - Very funny. I won't say anything. Cheers! Cheers! Iris! Iris? Iris, are you asleep? Iris? Eyal Menachem... Fire at will. You're in good shape. - Thanks. - How are you doing? - What do you mean? - Nothing special. I'm glad you're okay. Menachem asked if you could stop by his office. Good to see you. You can't disappear like that. So, resting? Having fun? The usual. We're starting a new operation, right? You didn't go to the psychologist. I won't go. Iris had therapy forever. I'm afraid they'll ground you. You know the regulations. - Fuck regulations. How is this related? - How is this related? - It was traumatic, so till you see one... - I can't believe this shit. Don't be so aggressive. I'm trying to help you. Go ahead, help me. - Remember Alfred Himmelman? - The Nazi you wanted to find? You can put it that way. - He's probably half-dead. Who cares? - I do. He wiped out all the Jews from an entire area of Germany. Hardly anyone survived except me, your mother and a few others. Himmelman lived in Argentina all these years. Some dirty deal with the government protected him. Two months ago, he disappeared. We don't know where to. - What did you have in mind? - Himmelman has a son in Germany... ...whom we always kept an eye on. He's not a child himself, has two adult children. The daughter met an Israeli and moved to a kibbutz. And a son in Berlin. - How do I fit into the picture? - The son is coming to visit his sister. She's worried about all the suicide bombers. So she called a travel agency to hire a tour guide, and I thought... What? Take him to the Holocaust museum? I think if you get close to them, we'll learn about the grandfather. And I need someone who speaks German. Menachem, let's be honest here. No one gives a damn anymore. He'll die by himself soon enough. I want to get him before God does. This is a security announcement. Please do not leave your luggage unattended. Thank you. Hello? Where? Rishon LeZiyyon? Shit! How many killed? Call Yaakov! What do you mean, no answer? Call again! Menachem! He hasn't come through yet. - So dial again. - I heard about it. - Galit! - Menachem! Shit, cell phones are dead. Every time a bomb goes off... Never mind, they'll come back soon. Fuck them! Twelve people killed. Hi. I'm Axel. This is my name here. Mr. Himmelman. Welcome to Israel. - You just missed today's bomb. - What? We just had a bomb. A terrorist just blew himself up. - Where? - Not far. Rishon LeZiyyon. It's a city close to here. - Very close? - Yes, but don't be afraid. They never do more than one a day. I mean, usually. But maybe for you, they will have a second one today. I'm joking. Okay. - What? - This music. They always play sad music after a bomb. Let's hear some good music. Okay. I've got The Doors, the first album, and Morrison Hotel... ...some Dylans, Tom Waits... ...and, of course, the Boss. - You like Springsteen? - Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Okay. Pia! Pia! Yes, that suits you. Come here! Careful! Come here. - Hello! - Hello! Careful, you'll get all wet. - You must be Eyal! - Yes. Hello! - Pia! - I figured. - Thank you. - I just picked him up. He was scared... ...when he heard about the bomb. - You speak too fast! I don't speak very good Hebrew. Little Hebrew. But I am learn... Great. Well, anyway, let's go. - Hungry? - Yes. Totally crazy! This is the "Maskeer," the director of the kibbutz. It's my brother, Axel. - Hello. - Hello. - Do you like the kibbutz food? - Yes, I like it very much. Thank you. The fish is very good. It's from here. - Your sister? - Yes. Very nice, your sister. I told her... ...if I not marry, I marry her. - Bye. - Bye. We've got Rikudei Am tonight. Oh, good for you. - What's "Riku Am"? - Rikudei Am. Israeli folk dances. - It's fun. - Do you know these dances? Well, I know enough about them. That's why I think I'm gonna leave you guys. See you tomorrow. Oh, no, please stay with us. Yes, please. - You disappeared. - No, I went to get some fresh air. This is fun. You like to live here. You can do it every week. I must remember the steps and teach them to my children. Hey, maybe you can dance with my sister now. No, no. We're not allowed to dance with customers on the first night. Sorry. - That was a nice evening. - It's always good. There's not much apart from "Rikudei Am" once a week. It's no Berlin here. Very good. - Who do you dance with usually? - All kinds of people. - No boyfriend? Nothing? - Well... How about our nice tour guide? He's really tough. - I'm sure he's good around the house. - He's like my last boyfriend. And? What came of it all? Sometimes it's difficult. People are very direct here. They just ask you, "Was any of your family a Nazi?" It's interesting that when I say yes, they look at me with pity... ...but they stay friendly. Nobody's ever been unfriendly because of it. If you accept yourself, others will accept you too. And that's where you're wrong, little brother. You really are naive. How so? As soon as my boyfriend heard more about our family, it was over. It ruined everything. First he said it wasrt a problem, not my fault... ...but he came back and told me... ...that he didn't hate Germans, but he couldn't stop thinking about it. He couldn't handle it. Do you want milk and sugar? I know, a splash of milk and one sugar. Right, you still remember. Axel, why did you come here? Don't you want to see Mother? They really miss you. - Mother asked me to ask you... - I knew it! Here, call and tell them you tried but it didn't work. Wait a moment. What do you want from me? I feel good here. It's good for me. It's beautiful here. But why don't you call or visit? - And why did you leave home? - I'm still in Berlin. How often do you visit? Every four months? Pia, it's not the same. At least we have a relationship. I don't want any relationship! You don't understand. Here. You can take the checks back too. I never cashed one. Totally unnecessary. Okay, okay, let's not fight. I'm here to spend time with you. And so Hansel and Gretel kept fighting. Very dramatic. What do you say? You're wrong. There's something there. You have to keep pushing. - Be focused. - I am focused. What do you want? - What's going on? - That's my question. We're finished soon, and I'll be back. Right, Menachem? - When do we start training? - No rush. Carry on with this. I'll come back. Something you're hiding from me? No problem. I'll go. Relax. - Good morning to you. - Good morning. Good morning. Why don't you join us. Well... Maybe I can use an egg. So where are you going? - You're not coming with us? - No, I have to work. I'll join you on the weekend. Do you have a nice plan for today? Well, we have many options. We can go see Christian holy places... ...or places mentioned in the Bible, whatever Axel wants. There are so many places I wanna see. Haifa is beautiful, isn't it? And I also wanna see the Sea of Galilee, Kinneret. Kinneret. You seem to know the country pretty well. I've always been interested in Israel. I also wanna see Palestinian cities. Can we go to the West Bank? It's the other direction. Why do you want to go there? Why not? I brought a few of my CDs. Be my guest. Let me see what else you've got there. Many woman singers. - Only women. - Why? I like female singers. When a man sings, I feel like... ...there's something missing. - Really? That's strange. - Who is this? - Gigliola Cinquetti. She's Italian. Fits in perfectly with the scenery, don't you think? So how many children do you have? - I don't have any children. - But you said something about... ...teaching your children to dance. - No, I meant the children that I teach. I work for this organization. We help children of immigrants from Turkey and other places. We help them with their homework. We read with them... There's not much money with that work. My God, you just sound like my parents. Why? What do they think? My father owns this big factory, and he wants me to work there. - I see. - He always expected us... ...to join the family business one day. But then Pia left... ...and I just told them I'd rather do something useful with my life. So tell me more about your family. Well, there's not so much to tell. It's only my parents and Pia. - No grandparents? - No. They died a long time ago. - Do you have any? - What, grandparents? - Yeah. - No. Actually, even my mother died a few years ago, and my father. - He died when I was in high school. - Oh, I see. - Do you have any children? - No. - I'm not going to have any. - Why not? Forget it. You don't have to hear my pessimistic view of the world. Hi, Pia. No, no, no. We're already in the North, why? Oh, I see. You wanna talk to him? Okay, okay. Bye. They had a bomb in Haifa, very close to where we passed. What happened? Another one of those fucking terrorists exploded. Four people died. Shit. It's terrible. Did you ever think why these people are doing this? I mean... ...how desperate they must be to go out and kill themselves? What's to think? They're animals. There's a lot to think. They have mothers and children. So why do they come and kill innocent mothers and children here? There's nothing to think about. He says his grandfather is dead. I'm stuck with this pseudo liberal... ...who talks about suicide bombers' motives. I almost punched him. Calm down. What did he say about his grandfather? - He doesn't have one. - Find out more. Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe... Maybe he thinks he's Dolly the clone-sheep and never had one. Stop acting like a child. Maybe you do need a therapist. I don't need to host a patronizing German peacenik... ...for the Foreign Ministry. Why are you getting so uptight? It's not like you. Relax, have some fun. And if you happen to learn something... - Whatever. I've got to go now. - Call me later. The Sea of Galilee. So this is where it all happened. Hey, Jesus, they lied to you. It's impossible to walk on water. Bravo. You did it. You don't understand. You can't just come to the Sea of Galilee... ...and start walking on water. If you could, everybody would be doing it. You need to prepare yourself. And how would you do that? - Please enlighten me. - Well... ...you need to completely purify yourself. Your heart needs to be like it's clean from the inside... ...no negativity, no bad thoughts. And then? And then you can walk on water. I'm sure of it. Where did you go? - I just went to get something. - What? We gotta do "Cinderella Rockefella." - Rubbish, you're crazy. - Why not? What are you talking about? - My little brother is drunk. - I didn't drink anything. You remember the song "Cinderella Rockefella"? - Cinderella who? - Do you remember Esther Ofarim? Ofarim. Yes, I know the name. - How do you know of her? - She and her husband, the Ofarims... ...they were huge in Germany in the '60s. - My aunt was a great fan of hers. - She taught us that song. Axel and I used to sing it at family parties. We used to get dressed up as prince and princess. Thanks! Thanks a lot! Thank you, Tom. And now we have a surprise. Our Pia and her brother Axel. Go for it, Pia! ...first to the right... - No, no, first with the left foot... Yes, left foot forward, turn right, then a double side-step... You do it great. Come to Berlin. We'll do it at Father's party... No way. You're out of your mind. They said something about a party, but with no details. Forget it, Menachem. They'll be here any minute. I'm taking him to the Dead Sea. Via the Jordan Valley. During the day, it's safe, don't worry. I'll show him Jericho. He wants to see Palestinians. He's such a nudnik. I won't stop in Jericho, don't worry. I might drown him in the Dead Sea. Might be a world news scoop. Okay, Menachem. They're here, I gotta go. Bye! - Hi. - Good morning. Morning. Make sure my brother puts on suntan lotion. He always gets sunburned really fast. Two hours on the desert, he'll be red like a tomato. No problem. It's part of the service. So tell me. - Does she like living here? - Yes, she loves it. Does she have a boyfriend? She had one, but not anymore. A guy she met in India. - She says Israeli men are... - What? - Impossible? - Yes. I mean, no. It's okay. She's not the first to think so. Is it true that Israeli men don't talk about their feelings? I don't know. I really don't like to talk about it. So are you in a relationship? I'm not so great in relationships, I think. Do you know anyone who's good at relationships? I guess you're right. How can you ever know what a woman is really thinking? They always complain that you never listen. "You're not connected to your emotions. You never cry." Just never know when they're serious, when they really mean it. What do you mean? For many years, I was involved with a woman, Iris. That's it. Now I'm on my own. Come on, let's take this stuff off. It's an Arabic word. It means "come on." You don't have to walk on water here. You can float on them instead. - You really never cry? - Never. Not even when you see a sad movie or hear a sad song? It's okay, I have a good excuse. When I was 15, the doctors discovered... ...I have a rare eye problem. My tear ducts are dry, so I can't cry even if I want to. - Oh, shit, your sister's gonna kill me. - What? You're really burnt. Okay, put some on your arms. I'll do your back. So they didn't circumcise you? I think I never saw one. You know, we used to talk about it in the army. If it looks bigger and if it's better in bed. I don't know, it's the only one I ever had. Is everybody like that in Europe? In Germany hardly nobody is circumcised, except for the Turks. In other countries of Europe? Let me think. Italians? Definitely not circumcised. Also, the English and the French, definitely not. Only the Muslims are circumcised in Europe... ...and the Jews, of course. I think it looks better circumcised. I see you know quite a lot about it. Thank you. It's so freezing out here. No, don't move away. The only way to keep warm is to sit close to each other. Every Israeli soldier knows this. So how often does your sister visit you? - She doesn't. - Why not? She doesn't get along with my parents. I actually came here to try to bring her back... ...to my father's birthday party. - Birthday party? Yes, my father's going to be 70, and we're organizing a party for him. My mother thought it would be a great surprise if Pia came. Sounds nice. Yes. It's going to be a big thing with lots of guests. You know, my parents live in this villa next to Wannsee. That's where the party's going to be. But Pia, she doesn't even wanna talk about it. - Can I ask you something personal? - Of course. I've got nothing to hide. Go ahead. I've always wondered what it was like to grow up in Germany... ...and then suddenly realize... ...what happened in World War II. Well, that's not such an easy one. - Was your family in the...? - You're changing the subject. Okay, I'm sorry. To tell you the truth, it's something we almost never talk about. My friends, they feel like it's something from the past. They feel like it's something... ...we don't have anything to do with. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. It actually feels right to talk about it... ...especially in Israel. It's just that whenever I try to talk about it, I... I don't know, I never find the right words. I feel... I don't know... ...stupid. This is an interesting way to put out a campfire. It's the best way. They teach it to you in the Boy Scouts. I told you, you haven't been drinking enough water. Didrt listen. That was beautiful. Thank you. You're very welcome. Here, listen. That's an Israeli female singer for you. What's the song about? It's a love song, you know. But what are the words? Can you translate? Guess I can try. "The two of us are riding in a car. You tell me it will be a long ride. That I can fall asleep. Later, you tell me everything that happened. I'm not sleeping. I'm... ...counting stars through holes in the blanket. And you with a cigarette in your mouth... ...singing along with the radio. A love song. Kiss me strong. Kiss me until it hurts." That's it, more or less. It goes on like that. Fire at will. Shit! What's up? You're working hard, eh? - Too many female singers. - What? Nothing. I'm just... You're not... Do you have to report this? Could you just...? It's okay. There's nothing wrong. It's not that bad. Go home. Have a nice weekend. - Rest. Don't worry. - Look, it's a problem. The guy's in complete denial. He's been through a trauma. It might be risky to send him on such a complicated job. Are you saying that just so you can keep him? I'll be done with him in two days. It's fine with me. You know what? Check his results from today's practice. I bet he wasrt good. I don't know. I can't give him up. He did a terrific job with Abu lbraim. I need him. I can insist he sees Rudy. I'll convince him he's not just any shrink but the chief counselor. Am I interrupting? No. Just asking when you'll be done with this bullshit. Just a couple of days more. Menachem, we need to talk. Just a second. Let me finish with Jello. Take this. Check the extra material on Himmelman. Extra material? I told you he's dead. What do you want? Sorry. Too much desert. I'll be sitting outside, reading. Take your time. You look different today. - Different? - Yes. - I don't know, your hair looks... - You said we're going... ...to a fancy restaurant in Tel Aviv, so I put on some lipstick. - It's nice. - Thank you. Can I offer you dessert? We have hot chocolate souffle with ice cream. We have creme brulee. We'll wait till my brother comes back. Okay, I'll give you a few minutes. - Excuse me. - Yes? Do you know where there's a nice party held tonight? A good one, but you have to be a very good dancer. He's very friendly, your brother. Yes, he is. I have the address to the best party in town. It's a place called TLV. Don't look at me. I know nothing about these things. I mean, nothing. - Are you sure this is the right place? - Yeah. Looks great, doesn't it? You want a drink? - Yes. - Beer, please. - What can I get you, sweetie? - "Sweetie"? - Okay, then, not sweetie. - Three Heinekens. I'm going over for a sec. Thanks. - Let's go dance. - No, no. - I don't think so. - Why not? You go dance. I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm okay. Do you mind? - I'm going. - Why? I just have to go. Pick you up tomorrow at the hotel. Morning. Did you sleep well? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Good morning. Is it okay if Rafik takes a ride with us to Jerusalem? - He lives in... What's it called? - Bayt Jala. An Arab?! Whatever. You're paying. This is where the border used to be... ...until we took over East Jerusalem in '67. Arab snipers were sitting on top of these walls. If they had a bad day, they would shoot the Jews walking on the other side. I think we should get off here. - Can you please let us off? - Why? Rafik is taking me to his uncle's shop. This is the Wall. Maybe you'd like to put a note there. The religious believe God reads them. - You've no reason to be upset. - It doesn't matter anymore. The main thing is that he found someone to take him shopping. Isn't that why he came to Israel? It's so strange. He always liked to flaunt it back in high school... ...in front of our parents' friends. It was the first thing... ...that he'd say, "Ich bin schwul." "I'm gay" in German. But he didn't say a word to me. Neither did you. But it really doesn't matter anymore. Maybe you frightened him, said something that... - So now it's my fault? - No, it's not a question of fault. I really don't wanna talk about it. Let's talk about you, okay? Why won't you go to your father's birthday party? He told you about that? - Is it a secret? - It's not. I just don't wanna go. Why not? I don't want to go back. I don't want to see them again. But they're your parents. Are you taking sides on this now? This is the womars section. Do you want to put a note? Oh, here's Axel. - Hey. - Look at this. I wanted one for years. - How much did you pay? - Hundred euro. - Rafik got him to lower the price. - Give me the jacket. - What is it? - I'll speak to him. Stay out of this! - What are you doing? - Let me handle this. It's all right. He would've paid twice as much in Berlin. - It's principle. - What principle? He's satisfied. - He doesn't feel he's been ripped off. - Stay out of this, okay? Give back the money! One hundred? You should be ashamed. You won't get a better price. I promise. It's enough, great. Here. One hundred. Take back 20. You get it for 80. You're trying to cheat? Give me the money. 20, 40, 60, 80... That's it. Only 20? What are you thinking? - You didn't have to do that. - Why not? - I told you, it's a good price for Axel. - So what? So it wasrt too much money for me. - I feel so bad for those shopkeepers. - Oh, poor Palestinian shopkeepers. I forgot you Germans are so sensitive. Human misery always touched your hearts. - What did you say? - Nothing, forget it. I will go now. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's not your fault. It was very nice to meet you. Take care. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Stay in touch. - Can I say one sentence? - Go ahead. You Jews are so obsessed with what was done to you in the past. Maybe if you let go... ...you'd be able to see... - That's already three sentences. - Okay. Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. This is all that's left of a full public bus... ...after another suicide bomber blew himself up. The terrorist, driving a 4x 4 SUV, stopped behind the bus... ...while it was picking up passengers at this station... - The atmosphere here is pretty grim. - Yes. You've never thought of coming home? You want to ruin our last evening? - They're your parents, damn it! - You know nothing about them. - Then tell me something. - I don't want to. It'd do no good. If there's something I should know, then please tell me, okay? You really don't know, do you? All the hours Father spent alone in his room? The long-distance calls in the night? - What do you mean? - His "stock market" calls? Once, I picked up the phone and heard... ...that our grandfather was still alive. That they'd helped him escape and hide for years. - He's alive? - He was when I left. I can't believe it. They said he died towards the end of the war. They said a lot of things. I was so mad. I screamed at them. I insisted that we turn him in. - Do you think he's still alive? - I don't know. I moved out the same day. Father was afraid I'd go to the police. It was terrible. I don't understand. Why didn't you tell me? You'd just gone to Italy. You were in love. I didn't want to ruin it. I was back two weeks later! I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't handle it. See you. Take care of yourself. We have to get going. Well, you've got my phone number... ...if you're in the area sometime. Okay, thanks. It's 102 FM Radio Tel Aviv... ...and as usual we play you soft music... ...the morning after a suicide bombing. Thank you so much for everything. I had a very interesting vacation. My pleasure. This is my address in Berlin. You're more than welcome if you're ever around. Thank you, but to tell you the truth... ...l've never been to Germany, and I don't think I'll ever want to go. Well, if you change your mind. You tell him. I feel wrong about it anyway. No problem. It should come from me. I'll keep him busy with Himmelman. How long will this Nazi shit continue? Isn't this thing getting too expensive? Don't worry, I talked to the boss. Your ass is covered, I... Hello, Eyal. Did he catch his plane? Yes, he's gone. Could've told me he's homo. - Why does it matter? - Did you spend two weeks with him? - A real "homo" homo? - No, a half-homo. Did he have wandering hands? He try to touch you? - I take it you really had fun. - I'm not amused at all. Here's your last disc. I didn't even listen to it. I'm done with this. I'm ready for the new operation. Okay, I'll leave you alone. I can't believe you got me mixed up with this crap. Touring around with... I mean, I've got nothing against him... ...but everyone's started training. I missed three days already. Listen! They decided you're not... I told you... I warned you. - What? - I'm sorry. I tried. I told them you were really good with the Germans. - That you are in great shape. - Fuck! Those mother...! Who do they think they are? I started this mission, and I'm supposed to finish it! What other agent would do such a clean job? - I... Forget it. - Don't take it so bad. - There will be other operations... - I've had enough of you! Enough of you and of your stupid Nazi games! - Hello. - Hello. Menachem asked me to deliver this. - He wants you to listen to this. - Thanks, I... - Do you need it back? - No. - I... If I'm not needed, I'll just leave. - Thanks. Once, I picked up the phone and heard... ...that our grandfather was still alive. That they had helped him to escape and hide for years. - He's alive? - He was when I left. I can't believe it. They said he died towards the end of the war. They said a lot of things. I was so mad. I screamed at them. I insisted that we turn him in. - Do you think he's still alive? - I don't know. I moved out the same day. Father was afraid I'd go to the police. It was terrible. Good day. Thank you. Thank you. Please do not leave your baggage unattended. Radio One! For adults only. I'm Knut Elstermann! Let's start the day with a cool oldie. I hope... ...that you all are well and that you have a nice and a peaceful day. Here's Buffalo Springfield with "For What It's Worth." What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. Well, you did. - Thank you. - I really love hot dogs. This is not a hot dog. It's a currywurst. - Currywurst? - Currywurst. - It's really nice here in Berlin. - Well, what did you expect? I don't know. The truth is I was... I was afraid you wouldn't be happy to see me. No, you don't understand, l... I... But I can explain to you. I was in a very delicate situation when I came to Israel. Delicate? - Remember I told you about Iris? - Your girlfriend? Well, the truth is she was my wife. We were married for a few years... ...and about a month before you came to Israel, she suddenly... She left. And we don't have tourists now, and there's not much work, so I... You see, after you left, I really felt that... I didn't want you to think that just because... You know. So I bought a ticket and... It's okay. Eat your currywurst. It will get cold. Before I forget. I don't believe it. Folk dancing. Thank you. It's very nice. You have no idea how nice. Do you know how humiliating... ...it was to walk into Tower Records and ask for this music? You should have seen the guy there, how he looked at me. - Can I have two beers, please? - What kind of beer? - You have Heineken? - Sure. So where are you from? Israel. - Something to eat? - We just gorged on currywurst. - Oh, gourmets! - Yes. Well, maybe he doesn't like Israel, but I think he likes you. Really? I wouldn't know. I'm not into German guys. - What do you mean? - I've never been with a German guy. - What? - I've been with Italians, English... ...French, Turks, the Palestinian, but never with a German guy. You have any idea why? Not really. It just worked out that way. I guess it's less complicated. I always thought you people were more easygoing about these matters. - Who? Germans? - No. - You know... - Homos? Yes. I thought it's more easy, like with the Arab. - You met, and right away... - Rafik? I'm not sure if that's true in his case, but, yes... ...sometimes it's very fast. Why? - Are you jealous? - No. - But it could be fun sometimes, no? - What? Being able to see someone you like and just go straight to bed... ...not having to talk much. - Yeah, that can be nice. And... And when that happens... ...how does it work out? I mean... ...how do you know...? - Oh, you straight men. - What? - You're all the same. The only thing you want to know is who does the schnooky-schnooky. Oh, really? No, I mean... Well, it's interesting. You, for example. What do you...? If you really need to know, I like it both ways. After all, how many options are there? It would be stupid to limit yourself. But... ...doesn't it hurt? No, not really. You have to relax your tushy, and then it can feel pretty good. The feeling of someone entering your body... ...the feeling of a... Maybe that's enough for the first time, huh? So how is your Arab friend? Much better after I sent him another 100 euro... ...to give his uncle for that stupid jacket. - Axel! - Surprise! Hi, sugar. - Hello! Who's this hottie? - He looks yummy! Oh, you're cute. He's a friend from Israel. How do you do? How's the party at "Roses" today? - Good, as always. - All right, first I need a drink. I feel like something else. Pull yourselves together, girls! Bye! - They thought you were cute. - Should I be flattered? Don't get upset. They're really okay. Some of them even volunteer in our organization. Don't patronize. Remember, we invented Dana International. You okay? Eyal! Fuck off, asshole, or I'll blow your brains out! - You speak German. - Not really. - But you just spoke perfectly. - My parents spoke German. What? My mother was born in Berlin. She lived there until they had to move and hide. That's how I grew up. No German products in the house... ...no traveling to Germany, never talking about it. When they were alone and didn't think I was listening... ...they'd speak German. Is that why you brought the gun? I don't know. Just before I left for the airport, I got scared. I didn't really think it over. I just took it. It's too bad you didn't kill him. What? Too bad you didn't kill... ...that piece of shit! Those people pollute the world. They turn everything into shit. You know what? As long as you are here, why don't you come to my parents' kibbutz. - Their what? - Their villa. I told you about it, remember? My father's birthday party is this weekend. Come instead of Pia. I'd be happy to. You know, I almost bought you this CD. I bought it at the airport on the way home. I bought so many Hebrew CDs. Only female singers, I hope. Let's stop here for coffee. Thanks. That was the first highway in Germany. In the '20s, they had car races here. Do you see those seats over there? That's where the important people watched the races... ...all the politicians, aristocrats. And then Hitler and his people. Yes, he was sitting there too. You know, when we were in high school... ...a group of students went to Germany... ...as a part of an exchange program. So there were all kinds of stories about... ...how the German girls were easy and, you know... But there was one thing I couldn't get out of my head. My friends figured out... ...that anyone they saw who was over 60 years old... ...was a grown-up during the war and probably participated in it. So they made up this game... ...where they walked up to all the people in the street... ...and asked them in Hebrew: "Where were you when my family was burned at the camps?" And they started laughing and, you know... Do you wanna play this game here? It did cross my mind. But I figure that only people over 80, 85... ...could've been in the army then. Very few are still alive. Don't be a sissy. Give it a try. How old would you say this man is? What is it? You won't believe this, but I know this man. He's a friend of my parents. Incredible. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here? - Watching over you. - I don't understand. Calm down. Introduce me, then I'll go. I'm staying here. Room 223. This is Menachem, a friend of my mother. This is Axel. - A pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. It's always nice to run into somebody you know just like this. - Will you join us? - No, no, thank you. I'm on my way. I just ate a little sandwich. Well, it was nice bumping into you. Bye. - Small world, isn't it? - Yes, this always happens to me. This is an Esther Ofarim song I really like. I guess I don't have to translate, huh? Here it is. Axel, nice to have you here. - Hi! - Come on, give me that. Okay. That too. No, it's okay. Yes, yes. There's no way out. This is Helga. She took care of me since I was little. Helga, this is Eyal. Welcome. I hope you're taking very good care of our Axel. - Well, someone's gotta do it. - Yeah. Then come to the kitchen. I made cheesecake. Okay. Come, let's say hello to my mother. Mama. Axel. My dear. This is my mother. - Nice to meet you. I'm Segret. - I'm Eyal. Nice to meet you too. - Eyal, that's... - It's an Israeli name. Oh, I see. That's nice. So you live here? No. It's my first time to Germany. Welcome, then. I hope you have a good time. Excuse me. There's so much to do. Ah, Axel, please... ...be punctual this evening. We start at 8:00. On the dot. - You look... - What? Very German. Thank you. You look good too. You think this jacket is good enough? Sure. Come on. - Nice to see you, my son. - Nice to see you, Father. - And where is your sister? - She couldn't make it. Does she want to stay on that kibbutz forever? Let's not talk about it. Today is your birthday, Father. This is my friend Eyal. A pleasure. Oh, Axel! - Nice to see you! - Hello. Did you prepare something for your father? Of course, Uncle Gustav. May I have your attention, please? I thought long and hard about what I should bring to Father's birthday... ...something fun with positive energy. I thought I'd teach you all a dance that I learned recently. I promise you it's very easy, and you'll all enjoy it. So... Form a circle and do what I do. It's really very easy. So... You, come. Okay, Aunt Frieda is there. All right... - Not you? - No, I have to organize something. And start with the right. You must. Come on. And again. And... That's it! Great! Thank you, son. You managed to surprise me. We wish him all the best Three cheers for him We wish him all the best Three cheers for him Hip, hip, hurrah! I'm very happy to be with my family again. And... ...in my homeland. Father! Blow the candles out. Axel! You cannot imagine how happy, how overjoyed I am... ...that my father and my son are with me today. This is Axel, my son. You don't know him. Mother! Is that why you sent me to Israel? To bring Pia for this? It all happened in the last few days. I never thought we'd get him here. Congratulations. Had I known, I never would have come. Don't talk to me like that. Can't you see how happy your father is? Sure. It's a pity the old man didn't give a political speech. What kind of a tone is that? From you? You always make things difficult. Why did you have to bring that Israeli? As though all you do is meant to cause us trouble. You really think so? As if we hadrt had enough trouble. All the years they watched us, like criminals... ...to see if we were in contact with Grandfather. What did we do wrong? Our phone's always been bugged. I thought it was over... ...but I guess I was wrong. I know it sounds crazy... ...but who's to say that your Israeli friend isn't from Mossad? Right! And if he isn't, I'm sure he'll want to join after tonight's show. Eyal? He's alive. He's here at the villa. - Sit down. - He's there. I saw him. I thought he'd come. He's very old, but we can get him out. There are no bodyguards, just a nurse. Take this. Are you crazy? Let's get him out... ...and bring him to trial in Israel. - Eyal! It's really no problem. We can do it, just the two of us. We just need a car... ...and we'll drive him to the pickup point. You don't get it. Nobody knows. - What do you mean? We're... - There's no we, no car, no pickup. You have to finish this yourself. Only you. Terminate him! - Terminate him? - Yes. - Terminate. - But, Menachem... - We can get him out. - Eyal, listen carefully. Why did you come here? To find this man, right? Now you've found him. So maybe he's half-dead, but only half. And this is our chance. Not to let him escape without punishment. Go! Do the right thing. For me, for your mother. Go! Don't be afraid. Get him before God does? Yes. Get him before God does. Iris, my wife. She didn't just leave, you see. She killed herself. She left me a note. She wrote that I kill everything that comes near me. I can't kill anymore. I don't want to kill anymore. Hi, Axel. It's 5:00 in the morning, and Tohm is finally asleep again. I knew I shouldn't have listened to you and your dear sister. All that talk about having babies and how it would change my life. It did. I have become a sleepless slave. I would go back to bed now, but I can't. We're picking melons this week. Anyhow, you and this Andreas of yours should come for a visit. You know, do the loving-uncle thing... ...so Pia and I can get away for a few days. The truth is, being a father is not that terrible. It's actually quite fascinating. All kinds of new things are happening to me. I dream. Last night, I even dreamt about you. We were in the North again, by the Sea of Galilee. And you take off your sandals, step forward... ...and simply begin to walk on the water. And you don't fall. You don't sink, nothing. You're just walking on water... ...as though it were the easiest thing in the world. And then you turn around... ...and hold out your hand, and I... I follow you. And suddenly both of us are walking on water. And we keep walking and walking. There is this music all around us. And I look at you, and you smile at me... ...and everything is so peaceful. And we feel good. Just... ...good.
