There he is. This guy's been doing this every day since lockdown began. [she whispers] He's coming. [barking in distance] [she whispers] Ha! Here he is. Majestic. See, this is what happens when they put us on house arrest for a crime we didn't commit. People start going apeshit. Exhibit A right here. [clattering] Where's your mask?! And where is your mask? Hi, I'm Annie Hardy and you're watching Band Car, the internet's number 1 live improvised music show broadcast... [drumbeats start] ...from a moving vehicle. Here's how it works. [funky bass beats] You write in one word in uppercase letters. I'm making a beat I'm gonna improvise a song and work in your word and before too long... ...we will have made a collaboration. [beats continue under] I don't know, why not? Something tells me you're not up to much. Yes, lockdown, getting it on. Having to fuck your own Dad. Come on, that's rough. But we do what we must. If you can't be free you must... ...commit the sin of incest. It's not the worst but it's not the best. I don't really know - do what you want. I don't judge, I'm objective as motherfuckin' fuck. Yeah, nice bike... ...man. [instrumental continues under] [she sighs] "Ring, ring," I'm calling 'em up. "What you up to today, you dumb fuck? "Staying inside, hashtag stayin' safe? "Man, you can suck my queef." Is it safe to be so lonely? Everybody's trying to kill they-selves. This place is like a living hell. For something with a 99.6 recovery rate. Raae-- Meh. I gotta get outta here. [music ends] Oh, shit on my face. Gosh, darn it! [clattering] Fuck, fucking, fuck-ass. I'mma kill someone. Damn it. [rummaging] Gotta bring this. This one? [softly] I see you. I told her that I was leaving two nights ago and she proceeded to immediately urinate on my pants. I wasn't wearing them. They were on the ground. It's OK, Goostein. [Goostein mews] - I'm feral too, I understand. [rummaging] It is one of the hardest things for me to do... ...to leave this little cat. Otherwise who cares? This place is a shithole. Angels, if I'm forgetting something, tell me now or forever hold your peace, please. Mm. And we're off... ...to see the world. Welcome to the ghost town. I never seen LAX like this before. Gate 135 boarding, ghosts only to the ghost plane. This shit is nuts. Check out "future me" over here. [woman coughs] Don't sound so good either.
