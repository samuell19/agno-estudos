Oh, my gosh! Don't push me! Oh, my gosh! Calm down, calm down! Twenty years ago, Kampung Besar, Jakarta, got additional burden of four new citizens who would later need ID cards and jobs. Soon, the babies learned to crawl, all cute and adorable. Since they were breastfed, they grew up rapidly. From what's left of the embezzled state budget, the kids could still get free healthcare. They were inseparable. They got the nine-year compulsory education for free. Put in your contributions, children. Although sometimes, they were still told to make contributions to the school. And the government barely provides them with playgrounds. Most space is used up for big businesses. Everyone prayed they would become healthy kids physically and mentally. One day, some middle school students hijacked a city bus. Get in! DETAINEES Turn around! But these are not our kids. There is nothing worth noting about their subsequent lives. The headlines are mostly about state officials' graft cases, and legislators who go overseas to conduct vague research studies. Some years later, the girl among the four friends, Mae, graduated from the secretarial academy. GRADUATION CLASS OF XVII YEAR 2003 Her real aspiration is to become a woman police. I meant, a policewoman. What the hell are you doing? You're jamming the traffic! Didn't you see that sign? Beat it! Now! You too! What are you doing here? Move it! Guntoro finished a computer course, but his real aspiration is to become a sailor. Benny did a short course on banana cultivation, but he actually wants to become a boxer. BAITUL HIKMAH ISLAMIC BOARDING SCHOOL And Eman's parents wanted him to become a chaplain, but he's had it with the boarding school after only a year because he really wants to be a politician. No comment, no comment. Hey! Yeah. Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey! So they became four frustrated youngsters. And they are a part of a bigger number of Indonesian frustrated youngsters. Mae, you're a woman. Don't sit like that. Just let me be, will you? Hey! What are you both arguing about? You're like bulbul birds, babbling on like that. She has a secretary's diploma, but still insists on becoming a policewoman. You don't understand my aspirations! One across, five letters, another word for "rarely caressed." - Damn, it's dirty. - Damn! Ben, Gun, come on, what's the word? What's the answer? It's boring, Mae's not around. You go get her. Okay, I'll go get her. Man, I'll go get her. Laters. Look, there's our darling girl. Hey. - Careful, it's hot! - Let me help. Sweetie, come to papa. What are you talking about? - Oh, wow! - Shut up! Mae is very pretty today in her red dress. Red? You got red eyes, maybe? Hurry, deal the cards! I meant, whatever she wears, she looks pretty. Stop teasing me, won't you? Just deal the cards. Hey! Stop! Peace! Where's Mae? As usual, I guess she has gone near the river. The river? She's a graduate. Why doesn't she look for a job instead? Every day, my parents remind me that I'm such a failure. Hey, listen. Look at me. Do you know why I hang out with you guys playing cards every day? I ran away from the boarding school. I'm stressed. You know, this moment, I wish I was riding the big waves at Cape of Good Hope, in Africa. - Chill, man. - Chill, man. Hey, hey. And me, I should've been a boxing champion at the Olympics. One, two, three, you fat-ass! Where's my mug? Mae snatched it. I just want a daughter I'm proud of. How did it become this way? And worse, she's our only child. Let me tell you, when she was 10, I was proud to see her fighting with boys and winning the fight. As a parent, I wish she could be like other girls. But she became a tough woman. Tell me, why do you insist on becoming a policewoman? Well, because I can't be a policeman. Hey. I want to be a sailor because it's my calling. Yeah. That's it! A calling! Yeah, I have my calling as well. True calling. Let's find Mae a husband, so she will no longer be our responsibility. Who would want her? Let's find someone outside this neighborhood. - Eman loses! Eman loses! - Hold him still! Hold him still. Relax, just accept it. - All right. - You're happy now? - Deal it now. - Yeah. Let's take a break, pray, and have lunch. Pray? You're pious now that you're losing. Thanks to the boarding school, now you never forget to pray. Listen, guys. Throughout my life in this world, I've done nothing I can be proud of. My only hope is the afterlife. God willing, I might just find happiness there. Amen! Mae, we love you no matter what. You're our only child, you have a historical duty to preserve our family's legacy, do you understand? Historical duty? The flame must burn on. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, yeah ♪ - Quick, Dear. - Yeah, yeah. You go west and I go east, okay? - Be careful. - You too. I know nobody in this neighborhood who wants to marry me. Even so, you shouldn't settle for less, Mae. - Yeah, don't just take anybody. - We'll be pissed if you do. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Peace be upon you. - And to you. - Still remember me? - Mr. Mardi? - Yes, I'm Mardi. You're Zaim, right? - Right. Mae is an adult now, she's eligible to get married - I'm seeking a husband for her. - Oh, right. Do you have any son? A son? A son? That's my son. Don't you have any other sons? Other sons? Are you for real? These are all my kids. Do you have any children? Yeah, kind of. What about a son? I have a son, but I don't think he suits your daughter. - Peace be upon you. - And to you. take care, Jat. For heaven's sake, why do you call me Ajat? I want you to call me Dasima. Why would you? - That's your son? - Yeah. Sorry, no chance. Stop it. Hey, will you guys help me? Don't worry, we'll help you. Anyway, how about you guys? Hey, she's addressing you. Come on, Mae, you already knew it. We won't be married before you do. Look at them. Put me down! Put me down! Catch her! PUBLIC BATHROOM RP 1,000 Dear! Dear! - Dear. - Yeah. - Want some cold drinks? - No, thank you. I only got one, how about you? All the good ones have been taken. I've gotten one, too, but he's more like a leftover. Mae. Mae. Sit down. Sit down. Tomorrow, your first candidate will come. We have arranged this, please don't feel slighted. Please don't feel like you're being bid. It's okay, Dad, it's like what you said. This is a historical duty. Yes, that's right. As a human, you must proliferate. Hello, sir. - You're Ramelan, right? - Yes, sir. I've been waiting for you, please come in. But you have to understand that I need to see her first before deciding. Sure, it's okay. Please sit down. Mae, here, use my powder. What is this, Mom? - It's better than nothing. - Mom!

You're wearing a skirt. Go, he's waiting, hurry up. - Mom! Okay, okay, I'll go. - Hurry! Ramelan, this is Mae, my daughter. - Hi, I'm Ramelan. - I'm Mae. Have a nice chat, I'm gonna go inside. Please. Let's go. Oh, my God. What do you do? I'm a middle school teacher. I see. THIS MONTH'S SALARY Don't worry, my salary may not worth much, but I regularly work as a private tutor. I think Ramelan likes Mae. It won't be long before Mae becomes his responsibility. - Thank God. - Yes, Dear. Why haven't they hold hands? Maybe they'll do that soon. - Could you give me a moment, please? - Okay. What is it, Mae? Excuse me. Where is she going? So how is it? Do you like him? Well... If you and Dad are happy, I'm happy, too. Mae. Excuse me, let me pass, please. Excuse me? Do you think you will fit to be Mae's husband? We won't let Mae marry someone like you. I heard nobody here wants to marry her. - Hey! - What? That's insulting! Listen, you freak. Mae is the prettiest girl in this village! She's our beauty queen! Who's your father, a king? Or a sultan? We won't let losers like you marry our girl. I'm not a king's son. - Right. - If you're not, then disappear! - Go home! - And don't come back! - Do you understand? Get it? - Yes, yes. Here's your coffee, Dear. Good morning, Gramps. - Morning. - Morning. - Excuse me. - Yes? I am looking for Mr. Mardi's house, thereof. He, thereof, has a daughter that goes by the name of Maemun. Is he available? Oh, there. That's his house, just go inside. - Is he home? - Yes, bye. "Thereof"? Good morning, sir. - Morning. - Morning. It's still very early, yet my second candidate has arrived. Do you like this one? He looks average. Similar to the one who came by on his scooter yesterday. I'm guessing he's either a repairman or a motorbike cabbie. Mae, if you don't like him... Never mind, let me have a look first. Remember, don't be cheap. If you do, we'll get offended. - Okay! - We'll be offended. What's with you? My coffee! Give it to me. Pay attention to my signal, okay? - Sure. - Hey, I want that coffee. Roger that. Ginger coffee? This is my late father's favorite drink. Let me. Haven't we met just then? The one carrying coffee? That's my cousin. Thank goodness. I have a feeling that Kamdi will be perfect for Mae. I do, too. Unbelievable! Listen, Mae will never marry a clown like you, you know? You hear? What if it's me she likes, thereof? Hey, buster, look in the mirror! Listen, if your father is not a king or a sultan, this neighborhood won't give up Mae to you, right, guys? Yes! Mae is our prima donna! - Our beauty queen! - Hey, hey, hey. Is your father a king? Is your father a sultan? Answer him! I'm just an ordinary person, thereof. Thereof, thereof. Go home! Eat shit! Don't you dare go after Mae! - Just drop dead! - Go marry a goat! Her suitors always backed out. I will diagnose her problems first. This is heavy. There are those who don't want your daughter to be married. They won't let go. What do you mean? There are three evil spirits who love your daughter. They are the ones who have been bugging all the men who wants to marry your daughter. Mr. Shaman, what's the way out, then? Please help us, Mr. Shaman. Don't worry. I have a close relationship with the metaphysical world. I'll let those evil spirits mate with the genies I keep. But there's a cost for that. I've already prepared the money. Bring your daughter here. I'll give her charms. I'll bathe her with blessed water to get the evil spirits off her. You're bringing food, right? You're the heavy eater, aren't you? You need to stuff yourselves, it's a long walk there. - So eat well! - Yes. Benny, Gun, Eman, we appreciate your help bringing Mae there. We are both still exhausted. Your coffee, Dear. Don't worry, you can count on us. Let's go! - How come my bag is so heavy? - What are you talking about? Once again, please be careful. Here's the map. You'll have to walk through rivers, swamps, and forests. There is the house. - Oh, this is it? - That's the picture. Yes. Dad, Mom, we're going. - Be careful! - Yes. - Okay. - Ma'am. Look after Mae! Sure. Hurry. - Peace be upon you. - And on you. ♪ Take my cigarettes ♪ ♪ Drink my coffee ♪ ♪ Eat with me ♪ ♪ You're my friend and I love you ♪ Come on. Come on, hurry. Don't you dare turn around!

What can I say, man? I still want to hang out with you guys for a while longer. But on the other hand... I'm a burden to my mother. So you feel you're a burden to your Mom? Of course! At this age, I'm still useless. And I'm a college graduate! To hell with being a graduate. Mae, there's a lot of useless, jobless college graduates like us out there. Yeah, a lot of them, Mae. Excuse me! It's not that I'm useless. I'm frustrated. I should've studied politics. Instead, my parents put me in an Islamic boarding school. Crazy. That means you're still useless. The spirits of the dead war heroes cry over the sight of a youngster like you. Hey, look yourself in the mirror, ape. Those spirits laugh at you since you failed to be a boxer and learned agriculture instead. Hey, that's the house. That's right! - Great! - Let's go! Jakarta! Jakarta! How old is your Dad's map, Mae? Wow, awesome shaman! Love, career, hex, love charms. Mae, you will surely get your mate. Look at all those nice cars. Rich clients. If you can get a rich husband, buy me shirts, okay? Amen. What? You're giving me a bath? That's the requirement. Just give me the charms, I'll bathe myself at home. No, the shaman must give you a bath. Wow, you're so lovely! How come you can't find a mate? Just get with it, I want to go home soon. It's my lucky day. Be my wife, okay? - Hey, don't be absurd. - Come on. What are you doing? Hey! Let me go! Eman! Guntoro! Benny! Let me go! - What's wrong, Mae? - He's trying to... - What's wrong? - He's trying to rape me! Rape? Mae. Mae, so how did it go? - Tell us. - Did he ask for anything else? Yeah, he said that none of my suitors are good enough. What do you mean? You both have been inviting the same sort of people. They all ride a scooter. They're either teachers or motorbike cabbies. Enough. Dear, Mae has a high taste. I seem to remember, you have a friend who has an athlete son. I think that's better. Hicks, all hicks. Whoa, Ben, you see where that guy is going? Hey, come here. What? Come here. Damn it. Why me? Gosh. You know where Mr. Mardi lives? Oh, Mr. Mardi? He has that lovely daughter, right? - Is she beautiful? - She's a prima donna, ape! What did you say? Well... Bro, a prima donna. I swear. Very lovely. Men fight over her and nobody's got her yet. Right? Is he a badminton player, Mom? I don't know. All I know is he's an athlete. - Probably a race car driver. - Race car driver? Bobby, pardon me for asking. What do you usually eat? I eat like everybody else, I just need bigger portions. - Oh, I see. - I eat a dozen eggs a day. That much? But only the egg whites. Egg whites only, huh? Then Mae can have the yolks. I eat 2 kilograms of meat every day, lean meat only, no fat. Mae might get fat, but it's okay, How about the bones? Well, when I'm short on money, I go for chicken feet. You have quite a taste, and you even eat chicken feet. You're kind of greedy, huh? I don't like that King Kong guy for Mae. He's far bigger than I am. You're right, poor Mae. But what if Mae liked the guy? She won't, I'm sure that Mae won't like him. Yeah, me too. Of course. Why are we talking about this? So you're an athlete? Yeah. He's very big. You know what, he eats egg whites every day. And Mae can have the yolks. What do you think of him? Better for her to just eat egg yolks every day, than not get married. -I'll have to go now, -All right. I have to escort my boss. I'll return next week. If you can, you better eat duck eggs instead of chicken eggs. - Ma'am. - We're not family yet. - Bye, Mae. - Bye. What's up? Let's have a chat. As the youth of this village, we don't like outsiders. Yeah, he's right! Can you explain? You were asking about Mae's house, weren't you? Yes. You should know that Mae will never marry anyone from outside this village. Do you understand? Hey! Why should I care? Don't act up! Hey, you! Are you a king's son? Are you a sultan's son? Help! Ouch. Help us! Help! Geez. Help! Bobby, you can get out now. Officer, I was the one getting mobbed, why did you lock me up instead of them? Have you seen how many people beat you? They wouldn't fit in here! Now get out! Boss. I don't like your attitude. You're quick to anger, just because you're bigger than most. - You should use your brain. - They insulted me, boss. Insulted? Yes, by people in the village. Why did you have to go there? I was seeing a woman in that village, Boss. You fought because of a woman? The youths don't like me, they demanded to know which king or sultan my parent is, that I dared to go after Mae. I'm very upset, boss. Very, very upset. I kicked their asses. Control yourself! I'm sorry, Officer. I'll replace the table. Sorry, boss. Wait a minute. They demanded to know whether you're a king or a sultan's son? That's right, boss. Then she must be a special woman. Oh, gosh. - Gun, where does it hurt? - It hurts. - Where? What did he do to you? - My arm is broken, it hurts! - Sorry. - It hurts. Mae. Benny? Hold on a second, Gun. - Benny, what happened to you? - Mae, can you move over here? I can't see you from that side, you have to move here. Okay. - What's wrong? Oops, sorry Ben. - Ouch! What happened? Where does it hurt? My neck is sprained, Mae. It must hurt. Mae? Oh, no, I forgot about Eman. - Just a moment, Ben. - Mae! - I'm here. - Mae, why do you ignore me? What happened to you? My hips hurt. Here, I brought you some fruit, I'll peel it for you. - Would you feed me? - Mae, but I'm the first one - Okay! - Mae, me first! I also need oranges! Hurry up, Mae. - Don't shake the bed, it hurts. - Mae! Mae, feed me. - Mae! - Hurry! Okay, okay. Give me the red one. Eman, these are oranges. Yes, darling, Rendy hasn't returned. [Ma'am, head down. Head down. He said that he was going to the police station. Have you tried calling his cellphone? Ma'am, please. Ma'am? Ma'am. Can't you wait for a while? Why? No, I wasn't referring to you. Why don't you call again later? Okay, I'll send him your regards. Bye. Rendy! Now what? Hello? Kania just called. She's the 12th woman that calls you nonstop for the past three months. What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for the 28th woman to call? Mom, they're all just the same. It feels like every parent nowadays raises their kids exactly the same way. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that they've been reading the same book about raising kids. So what kind of woman do you want? I want an original one, someone different, full of challenge. I don't understand you. You talked as if your wife is a crossword puzzle. Let's end this discussion. You'll be going back to America soon. I don't want you to end up marrying a white girl! Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hold him still! - Don't let it get into my eyes! - Stop it. Be still. - I'm done. - Now deal the cards. Quick, deal them. Man, you still look quite pale, why are you out of the hospital so soon? It's because Benny and Guntoro had gotten out before me. I don't want to be there all alone. - You too, Gun, Ben. - Huh? You both still look pale, why did you have to leave so quickly? Why not wait for Eman? Mae, if I had tons of money, I wouldn't mind staying at the hospital. - Hmm. - The nurses are so cute! - Like Sari! - Yeah, Sari. Sari! I see you guys are all smitten with her. Sari? Who's Sari? Her house lies beyond that alley, boss. - Her name is Mae, right? - Yes, Mae. - And what's her father's name? - Mardi, boss. Is she really beautiful? Oh, I've never seen anyone prettier than her. Okay. - Bob? - Yes, boss? - You like her, right? - Yes. If it turned out that I like her and she likes me too, would you give her up? Sure, boss, but I'm worried about your safety in there. Do you need me to go with you? Bob, Bob. I don't need brawn to handle these sort of thing. There's an art to it and I'd be better off using my brain. - Now go home. - Home? - Yes, now go. - Are you serious, boss? - Yes, I am. - Boss. The stock of my candidates are out. It means none of you will ever get married. Mae said that all of the suitors aren't good enough. And we don't have any rich relatives. I'm afraid it's Mae's fate to be a spinster. What more can we do? So our family line stops here? Hey. Excuse me. Guests. Mrs. Mardi? Yes, that's me. - Then you're... - Yes, I'm Mardi, but I'm not about to sell my land, I still have some savings. Oh, do I look like a land broker? So what is your... So... I heard that there's a treasure in this village. Something valuable. You can say that it's like an unpolished diamond. Oh, I understand now, you're looking for antiques. I don't have any antiques. I used to have a kris, but I've sold it. No, I meant something alive, not inanimate objects. Something with soul. I don't have any pets. - We don't have any pets, do we? - No, we don't. No, I'm looking for God's most perfect creation. The one you've taken care lovingly since infancy... who is very cute and cuddly when she was small... and now has turned into a beautiful and charming adult. Oh, you mean my only daughter. - But, she's not that remarkable. - Yes, she's not that great. She causes trouble more often than not. I like your humility and sense of humor. There's nothing like that in my neighborhood. It only exists in villages like this. Pardon me, but can you tell me what is your intention? - My name is Rendy. - Okay. I'd like to ask for your permission to get to know your daughter, the star of this village. Prima donna? I think you've been mistaken. Yes, I think the person you want to meet is Jali's daughter. I've asked around, you're the only ones whose daughter is named Mae. I can't be wrong. Hurry up, Mae. Who is it, Mom? Your friend's son? I don't know, your dad has even mistaken him for a land broker. Hurry up, he may get impatient and leave. - But, Mom... - Oh, no. Your face. - Don't bother, I don't need make up. - Come on, Mae.

It has to be red. Red, I'm sure it's red. We knew that already, Man. Yeah. - What's up? - Red or green? Stop being so concerned, Mae has no intention to marry yet. She still wants to hang with us. Come on. Drop it. I'll pick you up in two days, okay? We'll watch a boxing match. I'm sure you'll like it. Okay? See you in two days. Here comes the guy. Excuse me. Hey you, come with me. - Where are you taking me? - Just come. Hey. Where were you? Somewhere. - Wow! - Oh! We know you're after one of the women of this village, right? Yes, I like her and she likes me too. That's fair, isn't it? Nobody is being inconvenienced. That's not our concern, what matters is are you fit for her? Yeah! Which king's son are you? Yeah, which sultan is your father that you dare to go after Mae? Look, I'm not a king or a sultan's son - but I love... - Hey! You talk rubbish! This village will not let go of Mae that easily. Now scram! But this is a matter of two people in love, not the village's business. This is the village's business. - She's a prima donna. - Yeah. - She's our beauty queen. - Yeah. She has to have the best suitor. That would be me. You're really pushing it, you better go now. Otherwise we'll have to use force. Come on, let's not use force, it's time we use common sense. Whoa! Let's calm down and relax. Only primitive people use force. Let's talk about how I can help this village if I'm married to Mae. What do you mean? - Let go and I'll tell you. - Let him go. I understand why the youths here are so quick to anger, using force at every opportunity, unemployed, frustrated. All you guys need are jobs. Are you insulting us? Look, if you have good jobs and great futures, you wouldn't be so prone to use force, am I right? I can help the youths here and give them jobs in my company. You wait here a moment, don't go anywhere. Don't go. I think he can really give us jobs. Are you sure it was a red flag? Why do you ask, Benny said it was just a formality. What if we tell Mae that we think this guy is quite good? Damn, I should've watched that signal, why did I ask you to do that? Hey! Are you serious about that? Helping us. About helping us with jobs? I am. I think he's serious about it. Do you think Mae will like him? I say we just let him go. - No, no, no. - Yeah. Look, it's okay if we let him go because Mae doesn't like him. But what if he returns and offers us jobs, and we take it, then Mae finds out about it how can we face Mae if that should happen? You're right. Guys, how is it going to be? Don't take too long. Okay, we're done. Now listen, I think you better leave before we have to resort to using violence. - That's the problem? - Yeah. - You have to know. - What? - I'm not afraid of death. - Hey! You can kill me. You dimwit, listen. Society at large still needs people like you, now don't get too cocky and just go. Go back to your home. You're looking for trouble, aren't you? I've told you guys, I'm not afraid of death. I've just met a special woman. I don't mind dying, I don't care if you kill me. - We don't need to kill you. - Yeah. - Because we don't want to sin. - That's right! - Go home! - Go home! Now scram! - Here. - Here, here. I've told you already my background is religious school, not boxer like you. But you still have to be able to fight. But you still have to be able to fight. Well, maybe next time... - Mae, what happened to you? - In two days, he'll pick me up. He will take me to see a boxing match. What's wrong with you? Do you want to join me? How about you? He'll pick me up. - Who will pick you up? - That guy, who came by. He's handsome, and seems to be quite rich. Mae, he does look rich, but... I think he's the best mate I can ever find. I'm truly falling in love. Hey, guys, listen! Do you hear that? It's the sound of my pounding heart. Mae... But, Mae... Even if he later turned out to be poor, I don't care, I'm truly in love. Oh, he's rich all right, but, Mae. What's with you guys? If I can get married, then you guys can get married too! So what's the problem? Look, the way I see this Mae, how can I say this... I don't think that guy is right for you, Mae. - Yeah! - He's right! - He doesn't fit you. - Gun and Ben fit you. Hey, hey, hey! I'm the only person who can decide whether I'm in love or not and I can't deny how my heart feels! Do you know that? What's with you guys? He's okay, right? He's okay, it's just some bruises. Village youths, they can't be reasoned with. Ouch. See, doc, he was foolish, running after some girl from the slum. This is what happened, he got beat up by the youths. That's not unusual. Keep up your effort! All is good, please excuse me. Okay, I'll wire the money later. I'll wait for it, I'm going now. They said it has become the village's business. They tell me that Mae would only marry the son of a king or a sultan. Why don't you tell them that you have blood ties with the Keraton? What? Which Keraton? Why haven't you told me this before? Well, you can make up stories. Mae, I swear to God... I thought it was a red flag, I swear, that's the truth. No, you just don't want to see me finding my man! - Mae. - No! It's because of you! If it's a green flag, why did you say it was red? Your fault! You're the one who is supposed to be watching for the flag, not me! Now look at Mae, do you see her crying? Don't try to corner me in front of Mae! He's the one who told me that it was just a formality! He told me that the flag will be red, no matter what! It's a very easy task for you, if you see green, tell us it's green! - You're making us confused. - It's easy! Damn you all! I know you just want me to confess that I'm... That I'm color blind! Admit it! What? So you're color blind? You're color blind? - Color blind? - Oh, my! Mae, Eman turned out to be color blind. Oh, well. Well, I wouldn't tell you to watch for it if I knew you were color blind. Don't try to play innocent, Ben! You too! You both are being unfair to me, I'm your friend, dammit! I know why you both acted like this. You aren't ready to face the fact that Mae will leave, admit it! Come here, you. You're unwilling to deal with the fact that Mae will go away, right? Just admit it, Ben! Admit it, Ben! Come.. Come on! Ben! Ben! It's true, Mae. I don't want to lose you. Now you, Gun, admit it, don't try to deny it! Don't play dumb like he did! Admit it! Mae, I'm sorry. I can't imagine how it would be when you get married... and I'm stuck with these clowns. And what about you, Man? Don't try to use your color blindness as an excuse for not admitting that you too is afraid of losing her! - Damn you! - Come on, Ben. I never cared, Ben. A red, black, or a green flag... I'd still say it's a red flag, Ben... because I care about Mae, Ben. I care about you Mae, I don't want to lose you, Mae. Boss. - What's up? - They're here, boss. - Who? - Our neighborhood's youngsters. - From our neighborhood? - Yes, boss. Why are they here? Solidarity, boss. What? You told them? You're embarrassing me, Bob. You're crazy. Ren, Bobby has told me all about it. We can't let them get away with it. Right, Bob? We have to retaliate! Yes, Ren. This has become our problem too, right, guys? That's right. That's right. - We have to get even with those slum kids! - Let's attack them! Calm down, it's just a minor issue. No, it's an insult, Ren! That's right! Actually, it's my personal issue. Well, no, you can't say that, buddy. Ren, this has become our problem too. Our neighborhood's problem, right? Right! Listen to him! - Let's go get them! - Let's teach them a lesson! That's enough. We're civilized people, we should use our brains! - I don't need this. - Ren! Ren! - Get the door! - Yes. - Watch it. - Watch her head. Mae, what's wrong with your mom? - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with your mom? Go away! - What? - Go away! - Move it! - Hey! What happened? Huh? Mae has to get a spouse, dear. If I die... you have to continue our effort for her. Don't talk about death, dear. I don't want to hear it. Don't you want to get well? Stop talking about dying. Dad, here's the water. Mae. If I die before you find a husband... I will become a restless spirit. Darling, dying and being restless are two separate things. If you die and be restless, that means you're undead! Do you want to be undead? Dad! She keeps talking about dying, what if she really dies? If I die before you find your husband... I will become a restless spirit. Just so you know, we humans need to procreate. - Procreate. - I will become a restless spirit. You're our only child, you have a historical duty to preserve our family's legacy, do you understand? Hey! You want to fight? Huh? You want to fight? - You want to fight? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Bob. Why is Rendy so weak? Beats me. But if we bring more people with us, he'll do it, right? Let's just attack that slum without Rendy. No, pal. It won't be a legitimate fight. You're right. I think so, too. How about a tailor? - Mae said... - I'll just mark it, okay? A security guard? Will Mae like that? Okay. Man, just look at their names. We'll never know if they're telling the truth or not. - If they have good names... - How many did you find? Quite a lot. How are we going to choose? Anybody younger than 35. Preferably a bank employee. That's Mae! Just in time, Mae. What's wrong with her? Mae. I have to get married. - That's for sure, Mae. - Thank God. - Gun, get the list out. - Here it is. Mae, there are quite a number of potential candidates for you. Here, take a look. I'll take it to her. For you, Mae. Look closely at this selection. One of them will surely strike your fancy. With God's permission. Mention his name before you read. Mature men? Yes, mature, independent. What do you mean? We found them in matchmaking ads, in the newspaper. This is not going to work! - She ripped it up. - Oh, my. I... I have to marry one of you guys. - Stop kidding, Mae. - Don't say things like that. - Mae has gone insane, gone insane. - Hey! My mother is dying! You think I'm joking? - You think I'm kidding you? - Calm down, Mae. No offense, Mae. How can we get married? We've been friends since childhood. If we get married, it will ruin our friendship. Destroyed, Mae. Gun is right. I can't imagine being married to you. Can you imagine our wedding night? Why? I won't have the heart to do her. Be serious, will you? I won't have the heart. My issue is income, Mae. You know that a man has a duty to earn a living. Don't talk to me about earning a living, all right? If we get married, I'll buy you a motorbike. - Be a motorbike cabbie. - Motorbike cabbie? Fun, isn't it? You think it's fun for me? It disgusts me, you know? - So, what do we do? - Yeah, what do we do? I have to save my mom's life! Well... Jerks! Mae, please don't be angry. Mae. Okay. - We love our mothers, too, don't we? - Yes. Just like you. Benny should do the honors. Me? Why me? - Ben? - He's handsome. I have no problem with it, Mae, but I have to let the oldest one here do the honors. - You were born first among us. - Oldest? You shitheads. Okay. Look, it's an honor for me. I'm flattered. Especially to do this to save her mother's life. Right? It's a service to God, too. However, to marry you, Mae... - You guys are jerks! - How could you, Man? What did I do? How could you, Man? - What? - Mom, I think I want to get married. You think? To whom? Mae. What? Mae? Mae? You're nuts! Man, I know you really care about... What's her name again? - Mae. - Right, Mae. But don't you think she's a bit crude? Can't you find someone softer? Okay? You want to get married? Go ahead. You're a grown-up anyway. So? So what? What are you waiting for? Who do you want to marry? Mae. I'm glad you want to get married. Maybe it will motivate you to get a job. Make you forget about becoming a sailor. But don't marry someone like Mae. I know she's nice, but if she becomes your wife... Anyway, who do you want to marry? Forget it. My mother is getting worse. Mae, Mae, we'll go for a while. We want to... - Well, you know. - You know. We'll let you know the result. - Yeah. - Come on, Man. Ready? Wait, are you sure? For Mae's sake. Rock, paper, scissors. Okay. Rock, paper, scissors. - Come on! - One more time! - Stop fooling around. - One last time. Be serious, okay? Rock, paper, scissors. Damn! Rock, paper, scissors. Damn. What? You don't really want to do it? Calm down, Ben. If you don't want to do it, just say so! That's not what I meant. Hey! Listen to me. - Eman. - Try to be sincere! Let's go tell Mae. Damn it. Hey. So, who will be my husband? I don't want to get married to a reluctant person! Did you see that? See how he wasn't sincere about it? Sincere, Mae. God willing. Okay? Just say so. Are you sincere or not? I am, Mae. I will marry you. I just have a little cold today. I told you so. Good, then. This is good news for my mom. I hope this is good news for my mom, too. Mom, are you okay with it? You told me everything, Gun. Of course I'm okay with it. Besides, Mae's mother is my friend, too. Amazing. Your condition has drastically improved. I was right. The new medicine I prescribed you worked really well. You're wrong, Doctor. My daughter, Mae. She brought wonderful news. That's what made me better. He must be hospitalized. Excuse me, ma'am. Ben... Man... Take my place, will you? It's either you or me, Man. Okay, ready? - One... - Are you sure? Yes, we must be! One, two... You don't have to worry about anything now. Everything is under control. I need to speak with Mae alone. Mae... Guntoro is very ill. Eman will replace him. So be it. First, he had nightmares, Doctor, then came the diarrhea. Then he started throwing up. He must be hospitalized, ma'am. Excuse me. Hospitalized? Oh, my. Eman, you have to be hospitalized. You should be hospitalized, and who's going to pay for that? Mad! This is mad! Ben, take care of it! What's wrong with you, Man? Are you really sick, Man? You think I'm making this up, Ben? This is real, son of a bitch. You're stupid. So, you made up your mind about returning to the States? Yes, Mom. What else would I do here anyway? You also said I wasn't ready to run the company. Well, you haven't shown me that you're a responsible person. It might have been different if you were a married man. I will allow you to marry a white girl since you can't seem to find anyone you like here. I did, Mom. But she was snatched away. And you were so brokenhearted that you're escaping to the States? Was she really snatched? I didn't expect that Mae would be so beautiful now. Just like her mom. Oh, Benny, from now on, please don't stay up late too often. - Okay. - Just so you know, I never imagined that you would be my son-in-law. All right, future in-law. We're going now. - Thank you for your warm welcome. - Please forgive any of our mistakes. Same here. - Peace be upon you. - And to you. Thank you. Thank you. It turns out one of the bastards who beat me up had a thing for Mae, too. This isn't fair! Mae loves me! You know, I've lived in the States and learned to behave and act... - Using brains? - Yes, using brains! But you were right all along. You stayed too long in the US. You've forgotten the Indonesian way of doing things. What way is that? This is the Indonesian way, boss. Your best friends, showing their solidarity! Yeah! Ren... If you were in a one-on-one fight with those slum guys, that would've been a fair fight. But they ganged up on you, man! - They have to pay for that! - Yeah! Right! We have a score to settle with them! That's right! Once that score is settled, you can go back to the US. Okay, if I take revenge and we hit them. That's still not going to get me Mae. Wait, what are your options now? If you do nothing, you're not getting her either. That's why we have to take revenge! Yeah! Better than have you moping around. I see your point. But why are you so worked up? What's in it for you? Hey, Bob, tell Rendy how to be a real Indonesian. I think he's forgotten how. You're my friend, Ren. I don't care if you're right or wrong. Your enemy is our enemy! Let's get them! Please do it neatly. Please take this one. That, too. Hurry. Before the guests come. Here. Wow, Benny, you're really getting married! You don't look too bad, Ben. Lucky guy! No son of a king or sultan and you're getting married to Mae. Well, if you guys hadn't gotten sick, this wouldn't have fallen on me. Don't say that! Bad luck! Why would you say that? But I bet your wedding night will be a riot! Yeah, I wouldn't be able to sleep because I'll be laughing all night till morning. If you don't know what to do, just play cards. Or you can join us, foursome. - Hey! - Is that allowed? It's a bit of a shame Mae is marrying Benny. Hey. Don't say that. This wedding made you well, understand? This is a blessed wedding. Don't be stupid. When she didn't have a husband, you cried. Now that she does, you also cry. Such a crybaby! Why can't you be happy? - Peace be upon you. - And on you. You're here. Hello. Please come in, ma'am. May I sit here? Where should I sit? - Please sit down. - I'll sit here. I feel awkward. Mr. Mardi? Mr. Mardi, the religious official is here. Benny's family is here, too. The groom has arrived, darling. Hurry down. Oh, yes. - Peace be upon you. - And on you. - I've been expecting you all. - Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you harvesting? Yes, yes. Wow, my daughter is so beautiful. Come here. Benny? Is that you, Mae? You look very pretty in that red dress. Hey, hey! The wedding will start soon. Later, guys. Sir. Benny, I never dreamed of having you as my son-in-law. When I think of it, it's really crazy. That's all right now. Sit down. I, too, never thought you'd be my father-in-law. Is he here? Sir, please come here. Yes, I'm ready to begin. I've been waiting. Benny. Mae. Okay. Let us make this legitimate. I'm Guntoro. Have you memorized the vows? Yes, just relax. From now on, don't just say "you" or "me." You should call him "Kangmas." "Kangmas" my foot! I'm not Javanese. On this good and blessed day... we'll proceed with the wedding of our brother and sister, -Benny, son of Mamat Soleh, -Yes. with Maemun, daughter of... - Sumardi. - Yes. As we all know, the requirements for a legitimate Muslim wedding, there are five of them. - Hey! Hey! - Move! Hey, slum kids, come out and fight! - Calm down! - Is this all of you? What's the problem? - Shut your mouth! - Hey, you got a problem? Please calm down. Fighting is easy. But we want to know what the problem is. Okay! Come here! The youths of your neighborhood have insulted a friend of ours. What do you mean? Who? - Who was it? Who? - Hey, hey, hey! My friend Rendy here has been insulted and humiliated by the youths here. We want payback! Impossible! The youths here are all polite, well-mannered, ethical, active in youth organizations. Am I right, guys? Hey, hey, hey! You guys are an uneducated lot. Youth organizations! Sheesh! Yeah, what a bunch of hicks! They insulted us! Let's get them! We may not be well educated, but at least we're not thieves, robbers, or corruptors! Yeah! We don't use or sell drugs! I take this friend of mine as my wife... Stop! Stop! That's wrong! There shouldn't be any "friend" here! What's the matter with you? She's your wife-to-be. But she is my friend. Yes, but you don't have to mention it! In the standard wedding vows, there's no such thing as friends! If you can't say it right, I'll do it! Gun, this is not a game. I can't stand it, Auntie. Three strikes already. Just do it again. - Okay, let's do it one more time. - Okay, let's repeat. Benny... My vegetables will be gone! There go all my vegetables! My vegetables are gone! Buy my vegetables first! Move over! Move over! Benny, son of... Everyone! Our neighborhood is under attack by people from the suburb! All of the men! Help us! Hurry! - Don't go. - I have to. Gun! Don't go, Man! What comes first, sir? Battle or wedding? To my knowledge, during the time of the Prophet... You're slow! I'll just go defend my neighborhood. Mae! Mae! Mae, we're in the middle of wedding vows! Well, sissy, why don't you just wait here, then? Mae! Are we having a wedding or not? Excuse me! Oh, my. Guntoro, Eman! Hey, where are you going? Which are our enemies? The ones with the nice clothes. What? I'm wearing nice clothes! Just pick anybody! God is great! God is great! Oh, my God! What a mess! What a mess! Please be patient. They have to defend the neighborhood first. I have three other weddings to oversee. Please be patient. The kids here are good fighters. They will defeat the enemies. Especially my daughter. She fights like a man! Well, let me oversee the weddings elsewhere first, and I'll return when the fight is over. Sir, please, just five more minutes. Take that! Take that! Take that! Bees! Take that! What! Hey, hey! Get your face in there! God is great! Ouch, my foot! Damn you! - Come on, just hit her! - Enough! Stop! Stop the fight! Everybody, stop fighting! Did you hear that? Stop! Stop! Stop fighting! Everyone, stop! They said stop! - Stop! - What's up, Mae? Mae? What is it, Mae? This is all a big misunderstanding! This is a misunderstanding! Well, fine, then! Stop it. Stop! Hey! Attention, everybody! At both sides' request... we're ending the fight! No way! My friend has taken a beating from this guy! Everyone who is injured, relax. I will pay for all medical expenses until you recover! Actually, you're the groom Mae has been waiting for. He's the real groom! I apologize. My friends and I take the blame. This is all a misunderstanding! I'm sorry. We weren't using our brains the other day. And now, if you really love Mae... you can marry her now. Hello, Ren? Mom, come on over. I'm getting married. What? Married? To whom? Brothers and sisters, let's stop this fight and head over to Mae's house. Let's witness Mae and Rendy's wedding! Peace! It's been more than 32 seconds now... Be patient, sir. Hold this, please. Hurry up! Everybody's waiting! - He's coming! He's coming! - Who's coming? - Who's coming? - He's over there. Over there! Come, sir, people are waiting! Mae! Where are you taking him? Hurry! Come on! He's been waiting! That's him! What? Which one? The one walking with support. Is that him? You like him? - This one! - Mae? Which one do you want to see? Oh, my. - Oh, dear, it's really happening! - This one! - Can I marry him? - Him? - Yes! - Go on. Hug him! Finally, Mae lives happily ever after with Rendy. Mae doesn't forget her dear friends. Guntoro gets to work on Rendy's container ship. And he finds his soul mate there. Benny, who is too old to become a boxer, is trained by Bobby to become a bodyguard. And he finds his soul mate there. Eman chooses his own path. He begins his political career by joining a political party's security force. And he finds his soul mate there. As for Mae's aspiration to become a policewoman... she forgot about it. ♪ The first glance is when we first met ♪ ♪ The first glance is when we first met ♪ ♪ As if dreams have passed ♪ ♪ I never expected this ♪ ♪ I don't believe it ♪ ♪ A handsome guy like him comes to me ♪ ♪ I almost faint because of him ♪ ♪ It's because of him ♪ ♪ I'm in front of you Taking the courage ♪ ♪ He makes me want to dance and sing ♪ ♪ Move it! ♪ ♪ The first glance is when we first met ♪ ♪ The first glance is when we first met ♪ ♪ As if dreams have passed ♪ ♪ I never expected this ♪ ♪ I don't believe it ♪ ♪ A handsome guy like him comes to me ♪ ♪ I almost faint because of him ♪ Subtitle translation by Fahrizal Nurrahman
