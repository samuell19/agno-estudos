[ominous music] - [Sinister Voice] Nosferatu. - Nosferatu. - Nosferatu. [film reel clicking] [film reel clicking] [suspenseful music] [distorted muttering] [thunder cracking] - Max, I don't know. I haven't even seen him since this morning. Because he locks himself in the room all day and he just watches that movie over and over and over and over. Because, Mother, my own son scares the shit out of me. I'm just waiting for Don to get here, and then we're both gonna talk to him, and then... [giggling] I gotta go. [ominous music] [film reel clicking] Max, it's Mom, can I come in? Your father and I are really worried about you, honey. You can't... You can't keep yourself locked up in here for hours on end, watching the same movie over and over and over. We've talked to the doctor, and he'd really like to see you again, honey. And I thought maybe we could all go together, you know? Oh my god. [ominous music] [gasps] Maxwell. What have you done? Oh, okay, I'm not gonna tolerate this behavior any longer. [suspenseful music] [screaming] God damn it! [film reel clicking] [snarling] [screams] Oh no, Max, no! Please! [sirens wailing] - You're not alone in this. Death twitches in everyone's ear. There are no exceptions. [static humming] What's important is how you fill the space between now and then. That space is yours to define, to direct. Are you ready? - Yes. - Remember what Orson Welles once said. "Then enemy of art is the absence of limitations." - [Michael] Thank you, teacher. [static buzzing] - I'm not a teacher. I'm an awakener. [suspenseful music] [bell rings] [students chattering] [foreboding music] [sinister whispering] - Of course I'm angry, Matthew. They're mounting a revival of my show with members of my cast without me. - Frederick, it wasn't your show. [knocking] You were only the director. - [Frederick] I made it famous. - Well, certainly infamous. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't help you more. I have to go now. - Okay, Matthew, I look forward to seeing you at "Dracula" 's opening night. [sighs] Can I help you? - You said to come by. - Oh, that's right. Tanya, come in. - It's Tara. - You are correct. Have a seat. I'm afraid you'll have to remind me why we're meeting today, my dear. - Well, we were gonna talk about my audition for "Dracula". - Well, didn't I make you Lucy and understudy to the lead? - Yes, but not as Mina. - Well, it's hard to compete with Amy Petersen's passion, now isn't it? - Or her family's bank account. - Tanya. Tara. You're a good actress, and the role of Lucy is not, as they say, chopped liver. - But Professor Kinski, I'm a junior, and I haven't been given a leading role yet. Being an understudy isn't exactly what I... - Do you know what Bernadette Peters and Shirley McClain and Anthony Hopkins have in common? - That I don't know who any of them are? - Once upon a time, they were all understudies. The role does not define the actor's greatness. - Okay, so then if I were to ask you for a letter of recommendation... [laughing] - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. [sighs] Show me a Lucy, and then we'll talk. [energetic rock music] [bell rings] - But seriously, I'm really tired of having to fight for the scraps, you know? Bullshit. - Here we go again. - Fuck you, Ed. - Only if you're into that really dirty shit. - You're such a freak. - Hey, does anyone know who the new guy is? - [Ed] Amy Petersen's next drunken mistake. - [Quincy] What's up, scholar shitters? Hey Jake, check this shit out, man. - [Jake] It's kinda fucked up. - Glick, what the fuck is wrong with you? - Quincy, give it back. - Or what? - Or I'll kick your balls through the roof of your mouth. - Yeah, Quincy told me you know all about handling a guy's balls. You bitch! [grunting] - You weren't gonna hit a girl, were you? So Jake, are you a bully 'cause you have mommy issues or daddy issues? - Hey, you guys, take it outside. - Thanks for the advice, bro. So glad I got to meet you. - You and me, we're not done. Come on, Quincy, let's go. - I never said anything to Jake about... You better watch your back, Glick. - Dude, these are awesome. What are these? - Ed's actually in charge of the set for our "Dracula" production. He's also playing Renfield. I'm doing the score, and Tara here is playing Lucy. - It's a small part, I die. - You should be the lead. We should mess with Amy's brakes. - I like the way you think. - Yeah, maybe you could come by rehearsal sometime? The crew always needs help. - Yeah, cool. Maybe I will. Here, man. - [Tara] Let's go. - See you. - See you guys. [foreboding music] - The fuck is this? I don't see a shipping invoice anywhere, so. How did this get in our garage in the first place? Mom, what are you doing? - [Mother] Maybe there's something good in here. - Okay, but if it isn't ours, then I don't think that you... - Oh, don't be such a killjoy. Ready? [foreboding music] [clattering] If this is your idea of a practical joke, young lady, it's not funny. - Mom, I had nothing to do with this. You don't think that... - No, no. No, don't be ridiculous. That was a lifetime ago. Gonna go get a drink, take a shower. [door closes] [ominous music] [water pattering] [suspenseful music] [harrowing music] [growling] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [gasps] [phone ringing] [tense music] - [Duane] You've reached the voicemail of Duane. I'm not in right now, listen for the beep. Do your thing. [beeping] - Hi, Duane. It's Kyra. How are you? So listen, I know it's been a while, but you said that if I ever needed help or if anything weird ever came up that I could give you a call, and well, something weird's come up. And it's probably nothing. I don't know. [foreboding music] Mom? Shit. Okay, Duane, I gotta go. Mom? Mom! [door squeaking] Oh my god, no! [screaming] [thunder rumbling] - I know that you must fight. That you must destroy. Even as you destroyed the false Lucy, so that the true Lucy might live hereafter. But it is not a work of hate. That poor soul whom has wrought all this misery. He is the saddest case of all. [foreboding music] Hello? Ed? Hey, if I'm not supposed to be in here, I can just go. [suspenseful music] God, Jesus, fuck. [gasps] - Whoa! Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Why are you still here? - I was looking for the parking lot, I went out the wrong exit. Sure you're okay, you seem pretty freaked out. - Yeah, I just, I thought... I don't know, I just think I spooked myself, that's all. [chuckles] - Are you fucking kidding me? You're with this guy. This asshole. - Fuck off, Quincy. - That didn't take you very long, Tara. You're a slut! - Yo, why don't you just move on, man? - Is that what you think I should do, man? - Cut the shit, Quincy. - [Michael] What the fuck? [tense music] - [Quincy] You're a pussy! [grunts] [whimpering] - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh shit, man, that looks really bad. I think it's broken. Here, let me fix it for you. [cracking] [shouting in pain] Oh, you know what? I did it the wrong way, here. [cracking] [shouting in pain] Good as new. [dramatic orchestral music] Do you want a ride home? [dramatic music] - Okay, okay. I see everyone has the new scripts, wonderful. Now, I know we were all excited to perform "Dracula", but I had an epiphany. Bram Stoker was interested in confronting what frightens us. Coming face to face with the ugliness that hides inside us all. Sadly, today's vampire has been neutered. Dracula has become a sparkly romance novel reject. This is not what Stoker had intended. He created a monster to inspire terror and revulsion. F. W. Murnau, though he was sued for his insights, understood this. Which is why I have adapted his "Nosferatu" for the stage. Does anyone know where the word Nosferatu comes from? - The Greeks. - That is correct, Mr.? - Morbius. - Morbius. Yes, Mr. Dandrich? - Yeah, my role is half of what it was. The script describes Nosferatu as a rat-like being with a bulbous head and long fingers. Is that the costume we're going with? - Indeed, we have ordered a spectacularly hideous... - You told me that Dracula was gonna be sexy and sinister. The type of role that any actor would kill to play. - Jerry, I understand your... - This is bullshit, I quit! Administration will be hearing from my parents, Kinski. - Well. Mr. Dandrich certainly knows how to make an exit. - Professor Kinski, I actually love the changes. Mina is so heroic. I mean, she sacrifices herself to destroy Nosferatu. Was Murnau a feminist? - I don't know that I'd go that far, Amy. - So who's going to play Nosferatu? - Hm. Mr. Morbius. Are you a watcher or are you a doer? - I'm just here to help out with the crew. - That's not what I asked. - I guess I'm more of a doer. - I want you to look at page 57. Take a look at Orlok's monologue. - Got it. - Need a few moments? - [Michael] No, I'm good. - [Frederick] Whenever you're ready. - Time is an abyss. [eerie music] Centuries come and go. And death. There are things more horrible than death. Can you imagine enduring unending centuries, experiencing the same futilities each and every day? [applauding] - The part is yours, young man, if you want it. - Michael, I'm so happy for you. [thunder cracking] [ominous music] - Are you ready to be borne into the heart of darkness? [moaning] [moaning] [groaning] [groaning] [coughing] Savor. 'Cause you are my children of the night. - Hey. - Come on, man, I just wanted to finish up and go home. - I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise. I just wanted to say sorry about the other day. - Whatever, you were an asshole and now you feel bad. You're forgiven. - I just, I, do you like me? - No. - Why not? - 'Cause you're a fucking entitled asshole, and a bully. That's not what I meant. What I meant was... - Shut the fuck up. [foreboding music] - [Quincy] Hey yo, Jake! What's going on? - [Jake] This faggot tried to make a pass at me! - [Quincy] Ah, no shit? - [Jake] The fuck happened to you? - Nothing, man, this asshole's boyfriend blindsided me. [suspenseful music] - Jake, Jake. Jake, I promise I won't say anything. [coughing] You're a fucking coward, Jake. - What are you doing? - Hold on, I got an idea. Record this. And get in tight so no one can see us. All right, Glick, you got a decision to make. With a banana or my foot? - What? - The banana or my foot? Pick. - Banana, banana. - You getting this, Jake? Suck it. I said suck it before I kick the shit out of you! [coughing] - All right, Quincy, that's enough. Enough! [gasping] [grunting] - Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. [foreboding music] [distorted laughter] - Hey, Ed. [chatting] [phone chimes] [coughing] [gasping] - Ms. Brewster, why are you here? - Well it looks like you already know. - Edward's bicycle accident, yes, but that's hardly an excuse... - It wasn't a bicycle accident, haven't you seen the video? - What video? - Ed, tell her what happened last night. It was Jake and Quincy, wasn't it? - I don't know what you're talking about, I got in a bike accident. - You already knew. But since the Cullens are major donors... - Edward, is there anything you haven't told me? - I crashed my bike, end of story. - But there's the video. - Can you show me this video? - No, I can't, the app deletes it after you watch it. - Ms. Brewster, you were in a relationship with Quincy Starker, weren't you? And that's Jake Cullen's best friend? - Yeah, for like two weeks. What does that have to do with this? - Ms. Brewster, I think you need to find another way to get back at your ex. Or do I need to remind you of your status in our school? [tense music] - God, I cannot believe you're gonna let them get away with this. I mean, what is wrong with you, Ed? - Can you afford tuition here? I can't, so drop it. And who said I was gonna let them get away with it? [somber music] [sighs] [ominous music] [dryer humming] - What do you think? - Looking good. - It's a work in progress. [PA chattering] - Oh, something's wrong. Something's wrong! Donna, it's burning, something's wrong! Please, help me get them out! - I'm trying! - Help me get them out, Donna, please, it's burning! Help me get them out! [clamoring] - My finger's stuck! - [Amy] Help me, someone help me! - Someone get Francine. - It's stuck to my finger! - Get it off! Someone help me, please, someone help me! It hurts, someone help me! [screaming] [sinister whispering] [ominous music] - If anyone doesn't have a ride home, the stage manager will arrange something for you. We'll update you on Amy's condition tomorrow. Ms. Brewster, a word. [sirens wailing] I'm sure you know what Ms. Petersen's injuries mean. Amy won't be returning. Her understudy must step in. - You want me to play Mina? - You are her understudy, are you not? - I mean, yes, but I don't... - Tara. This is an opportunity for you to show me how committed you are to playing a lead role. I assume you still want that letter of recommendation? - I'll do my best. [eerie music] [humming] ♪ Ready or not ♪ ♪ Here I come ♪ ♪ I'm gonna find you ♪ ♪ And kill you psychos ♪ [chuckling] There you are. All right. [suspenseful music] - Hey. - Hey. - Kinski said you'd be up here. - [Michael] Yeah. Come here, check this out. - Wow. You must really love this movie. - You can't even imagine. Murnau was a genius. Did you know that he came up with the idea that vampires burn in sunlight? It's not even part of the lore. Don't even get me started with Max Schreck. He is the definitive Dracula. Everyone else is a fucking poser. - Including you. - I'm trying not to be. So are you pretty excited to be playing the leading lady? And my victim? - Actually, doesn't Orlok end up being Mina's victim? - Exactly, it's a murder suicide, which is what makes this story so fucking cool. - Just a suggestion. You might wanna rethink the whole crazy. - Okay. - It's less sexy than you might've been told. - All I'm saying is that if you're gonna go out, it's a pretty cool way to do it. - Yeah, or you could just, you know, die of old age. Happy. - What's the fun in that? - [Girl] See you guys. - Later. - Bye. - What if I told you that I had an idea? - Okay. - An idea on how to make Jake pay. - I'm in. - But I haven't said what it is yet. - I'm still in. [sinister whispering] - Hey, Ed, wait up. - What? - Michael and I were talking, and we... - We wanna help you get even with Jake. - [Tara] We have a plan. - You do? When did this happen? - It'll make Jake the laughingstock of the school. - It's a fucking good plan. [tense music] [upbeat rock music] - Okay, you kids, try to behave yourselves. And don't go sneaking my liquor. - Okay. - Yes, ma'am. - Bye, Mom. [door closes] - Okay. - Can I see it? - Yeah. - That's it? It looks like a potion. - What do you expect, for it to glow green or something? - No, I mean, it just looks ordinary. - Well the most dangerous things always do. - [Tara] Okay, guys, it's almost eight. - You ready? - Mm-hm, yeah. - All right, give me your phone. - [Radio DJ] K-107, all the hits, all the time. Over themselves. K-107, seven days a week. - I know that wasn't the real you last week. I was hiding who I was, too. [upbeat rock music] We should talk. - Now we wait. - [Tara] Okay. [phone chimes] - Really? [chuckles] - Really. [phone chimes] - And where should we meet? Hm. I have an idea for you. - How about away from your asshole friends? In the theater? I have keys. That you do. [phone chimes] - Okay. I know, see you in an hour. Curtain's up in one hour, guys. - What if he doesn't drink? - Then we'll go to plan B. - What's plan B? - Don't worry. Come on, let's go. [foreboding music] - Ed? - One sec. Hey. - Hey. I've only ever been in here for assemblies. It's kinda weird. It's like we're on a talk show or something. What's with the cooler? - Beer. - Are you okay? - Yeah, pretty much. - I'm sorry, man. Nah, I'm good. - It's from a brewery my dad's really into, have one. - I've gotta work out at 6 a.m. Wrestling. - Well I just thought a beer or two would make it easier, you know? - Why's the top already off? - I just opened it. - No you didn't. - Yeah I did. - With what? [tense music] - Don't fucking move! - What are you doing? - Plan B. Ed, give me your beer. Drink. Drink it! - You never said anything about a gun. [grunting] [suspenseful music] [coughing] God. A gun, what the fuck were you thinking? - It's a prop. Whoa, whoa, it's cool. Roofies are kicking in. Let's see what brand of underwear this rich prick wears. [foreboding music] [chuckling] Here, Ed, finish it up. Come on, don't back out. [chuckling] All right. Give me your phone. - What's wrong with yours? - I forgot to charge it. Okay. - I'm all sparkly. ♪ Oh mama ♪ [relaxed music] [laughing] - Oh my god. - God. That's enough for me. [yelps] - [Ed] Your house is fucking amazing, dude. - [Michael] Yeah, my dad's got good taste and a lot of money. - Where is he? - Turkey or Thailand, one of those T countries. - You should send it, the video. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Why not? And it's away. Consider Jake Cullen the most popular guy on social media. - Such a lightweight. - He's out. - So what should we do now? [sultry music] [moans] I marked you. Wow. What is this? - It's from a long time ago. [foreboding music] Got the tattoo to cover up the scar. [tapping] - Hey. Can you help me? [chimes tinkling] [ominous music] What the? Who are you freaks? Ed, this isn't fucking funny! Wait, wait. What are you doing? Stop, wait. [shouting in pain] Stop! I don't wanna die! [suspenseful music] - Immortality belongs to those who deserve it. [moaning] [coughing] [ominous music] - Hey, wake up, wake up. Hey, did we... Last night, did we, you know? - I mean, you were pretty drunk. - Shit. Oh, god damn it. You can't tell anybody about this, okay? - That's not exactly the reaction I was hoping for. - I mean, look, you're really hot and all, but I cannot have rumors about me going around that school, okay? - Fuck, fuck. - Jesus, ever heard of knocking? - You said you used a fake account. - Ed, curb your shit, what happened? - It's Jake, he fucking killed himself, it's everywhere. - Ah, shit, dude, fuck. We were so drunk, I must've used the wrong account. - Well you fucking didn't, everybody's saying it came from me. - It's true. They found him in his car. - Don't you dare cry for that asshole. - He may have been an asshole, Michael, but he didn't deserve to... - Tell me the world isn't a better place without Jake Cullen. Even he knew that. - What do we do now? - School starts in an hour. Don't leave, don't talk to anyone. Tara and I need to get our story straight for the cops. - But can't we tell them what happened? I mean, it was a prank... - What's that back to your letter of recommendation? Tara's a brilliant actress who drove one of her classmates to commit suicide. - Michael's right. We sit tight and say nothing. Not until we know what we're dealing with. [eerie music] [camera shutter clicking] - Son, you do understand how serious this is, don't you? - [Ben] I understand. [somber music] - Okay, Ben, you can go now. - What's up, sad sack? You got a minute? [tense music] - No, I'm kinda busy. - Oh. [chuckles] You're Ben, right? Now you know that lying to the police during a murder investigation is obstruction of justice. Now let's try this again. Do you have a minute? Let's get straight to the point. You and your little buddies are hanging with a seriously sick dude. - You mean Michael? - No. I'm talking about Justin fucking Bieber. Yes, Michael, but that's not his real name. - It isn't? - No. They used to call him Kurt Barlow, some bullshit like that. There's some other names, but look, I don't even know what his real name is. - Okay, so how do you know all this? - I've been following him. See, he's a part of some sick cult or something. And they're little claim to fame is remaking horror movies. - Oh, like cosplay? - Yeah. But they actually kill people for real. - Right. - Now go ahead, look it up. Google it or whatever you young kids are doing. The sick part about it is that the people thought it was a part of the show. Until they found the bodies. Then they blamed it on the caretakers. - Okay, what, are you a private detective or something? - I'm far from it. I knew one of Michael's victims. Her name was Karen. And I have reason to believe that more of my friends are in danger. - Okay, so why don't you just go to the police? - And tell them what? See, I need hard evidence. Which is why you are gonna tell me where Michael lives. - I don't know, don't you? You know all this stuff about him, should know, right? - Then why would I be asking you? See, I've been following him, but I lost him. Somehow I think he's onto me. Now what do you know? - Tardis. - [Michael] How you holding up? - Just awesome, especially since everyone thinks I killed Jake. [somber music] - You're phenomenally talented, Ed. - Yeah, everyone keeps telling me that. - You know, you aren't meant to go to some bullshit college that prepares you for some bullshit job. You're better than that. We understand that life's too short to waste on superficial bullshit. We deserve to be, to be part of something that not only respects who we are, it helps make our dreams come true. - Oh shit, you're a Scientologist? [chuckles] - No, promise. Let me ask you something. If you had one year to live, would you stay here in Bremen? - Fuck no. - So what if I told you that there are people out there that not only respect who you are, they wanna make your art a reality? - I'd say that sounds kinda awesome. - There's someone I'd like for you to meet. [ominous music] - Hello, Edward. I've been looking forward to meeting you. [foreboding music] [upbeat rock music] - Hey. - Hi. - What's up? - Nothing. - You wanna come inside, it's freezing. - No, I'm okay. I need to talk to Ed, so is he here? - No, he's in Rochester Hills with my dad's lawyer. - What's happened? - Hey, nothing happened. I told you I would figure out a way to deal with this, and that's what I'm doing. - Okay, well, is he coming here afterward? - I guess that's up to him. - What's the name of the lawyer? Maybe I... - All right, Tara, what's this really about, what's going on? - What do you think, Michael? I'm fucking freaked out. - Come here. Everything's gonna be okay, I promise. [tense music] - Is she gone? We haven't made a decision about her yet. She has to prove herself worthy. As must you, Edward. - What do you mean? - Go and find out. [shouting] - These are mine. Remember? - Now you can free him. Or you can punish him. The choice is yours. - Know what, Quincy? You were never going to be the hero. But you can die like it. [shouting] [suspenseful music] - Ed? [laughing] Ed? Ed. What have you done? - You shouldn't be here. [suspenseful music] [screams] [knocking] - Enter. [lilting opera music] Ms. Brewster. To what do I owe the pleasure? - Well, I heard the show might be canceled. - No, no, no. Nothing to worry about, it's all been settled. The curtain will rise as scheduled. - But wouldn't it be a good idea to at least postpone the opening? I mean, after everything that's happened? - What is this really about, Tara? Are you getting cold feet? - No. It's just, after what happened to Amy, and then, you know, Jake. People are saying that Ed might have something to do with it, so I... - Mr. Glick has been falsely accused, I'm certain of it. The school board says a resolution's at hand. - Okay, but still, I really don't think... - Tara. [sighs] Do you know what this is? - A piece of paper? - A blank piece of paper? Waiting for you to be writing your future on it. Waiting for me to be writing your letter of recommendation on it. - Okay. I understand. - Good. Because I expect great things from you. - Are you okay? - Dental work. Mr. Morbius, aren't I popular today? - Hey Tara. - Hey. - [Frederick] Great things, Tara. [ominous music] [knocking] - [Stagehand] Can I have your phone? - Yeah. - [Frederick] Principal Dryer. You know what you're to do. - Yes. - Just grab her back. [foreboding music] - [Ed] While she is off looking, slip off the bench. - Ed, why haven't you answered my texts? - I was kinda busy being a fugitive. Everything's cool now. Did you hear Principal Dryer and some of the board members are coming? They wanna make sure there's nothing objectionable. Don't you fucking love that? Tonight is the only night that matters. Break a leg, Brewster. It'll make it easier for Nosferatu to catch you. [footsteps approaching] - Welcome to our multimedia adaptation of "Nosferatu", a symphony of horrors. As part of our school's fundraising effort, we have added audience participation to our grand whigenal. Now these roles sold out months ago, but since this is a dress rehearsal, my old friend Matthew Hutter will be playing the Demeter, and as warden of the insane asylum, well, it only seemed appropriate to cast Principal Dryer. [laughing] Matthew, Samantha, our stage manager will escort you backstage shortly before your scenes. Everyone else, expect a surprise or two, and thank you for attending. Enjoy the performance. [harrowing music] [wolf howling] - It is a strange world. A sad world. A world full of miseries and woes and troubles. All men are mad in some way or another. And inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, you must deal with God's madmen, too. [audience applauding] [phone chimes] [phone chimes] - Okay. Okay. All right. Let's go. [harrowing music] [bell tolls] - [Whispering Voices] Your precious blood. Precious blood, precious blood, precious blood. Your precious blood. Your precious blood, precious blood, precious blood. Precious blood, your precious blood, precious blood. Your precious blood. [audience applauding] - You need to leave. - Ed, what's going on? - Something wonderful, but you can't be here for it. - Ed, you don't have to be a part of this, okay? You know we can stop it. - I don't wanna stop it. This is where I belong. - [Whispering Voices] Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina. Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina. Mina, Mina, Mina. Mina. - Your scene is next. So during the blackout, cross over to the ship's wheel. Michael, or Nosferatu, will make sure you end up where you need to go. - Okay. - Just don't resist, okay? - Thanks. - Yep, and these are for you. - All right. - Good luck. [tense music] [harrowing music] [knocking] - Very funny, guys, but this is a closed rehearsal, so you have to come back tomorrow night. [shouting] [gasping] [ominous music] - Are you ready for your debut? - What do you think? - I think you're marvelous. Now remember, don't bite down too hard, it hurts like a bitch. Let the fangs do the work for you. And watch your tongue unless you want it pierced. [waves crashing] [thunder cracking] [wind howling] [ominous music] - Ahoy, mates! Batten down the hatches! There's a storm ahead! [tense music] Frederick? What, what are you? [dramatic music] [shouting] [gasping] [audience applauding] [harrowing music] - [sighs] Fuck. [foreboding music] To whom it may concern. I am pleased to recommend Tara Brewster, who has been a student here at Harker. [grunting] [tense music] - Frederick, that was incredible! - I thought it would be. It was horrible. - Just have to get used to the taste. - I mean, I imagined killing Hutter for years and wiping that smug smirk off his face once and for all. - And you did! And it was glorious! - It was depraved, Michael! It was obscene! I murdered a man! - I thought that was the plan. - Oh god. [whimpering] This isn't me. This is not me. [grunts] - Richard, no! No! The Auteur was right to doubt you. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [tense music] - With all that makeup, I can't quite make out who you are. You're a student here? - I'm Brian, the stage manager's brother. He said his crew was a man down. - Well how nice of you to step in. - When we cue you, you'll pretend to open the cell door with these keys. And when you walk in, Renfield will hit you with the foam stool, and you'll fall down. [ominous music] [laughing] - I am the warden. My patient Renfield is asleep. [clinking] [shushes] [suspenseful music] [gasps] [applauding] [laughing] [ominous music] - [Whispering Voices] Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu. [suspenseful music] The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. [grunting] The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. [suspenseful music] [phone chimes] - Oh hell no. - [Whispering Voices] The infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. [tense music] The infected will be bled, the infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. [suspenseful music] [grunting] The infected will be bled, the infected will be bled. The infected will be bled. [voices whispering] Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. Nosferatu, Nosferatu, Nosferatu. [gun fires] [suspenseful music] [shouts in pain] [growling] [gasping] [groaning] [coughs] [groaning] [groaning] [tense music] [shouts] [growls] [coughs] - Hey fuckface. [suspenseful music] [crunching] [grunting] Are you okay? - [Duane] Do I look okay? [coughing] - No, not now. - [Ed] Tara! - [Whispering Voices] Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina. Mina, Mina, Mina, Mina. Mina, Mina. Mina. Mina. - We gotta get you out of here. [grunting] Let's go. Come on. [yelps] - [Duane] Look, go ahead, it's not gonna happen. Take this, and if you see that motherfucker, kill his ass. All right? And call the police! - [Ed] Tara! Come finish the movie with me! [suspenseful music] Nosferatu needs to feed on Mina. [wolf howling] Don't ruin this for me! [screams] [tense music] - Hey Duane, have you seen Tara? It is Duane, right? [coughing] Do you know you make a shitty Van Helsing? [screams] Where is she? - Where is who? - Tara! I'll make a deal with you! Finish the show and I'll let him live. Run and I'll carve him into tiny pieces! - Don't, Tara! [shushing] Don't! - Michael, stop. I'm here for you. [Duane coughing] - [Michael] I knew you would understand what I was trying to accomplish. - [Duane] Tara, don't! [coughing] [suspenseful music] - You belong to me, Mina. We belong to one another. In eternal darkness, we shall be joined as one. - Shut up and do it already. [wailing] - I'm ready. The stake. You said it yourself, Mina kills Nosferatu at the end. - No. - Yes. Kill me. Do it. [grunts] Come on! Do it! Please! - No, I can't. - Do it! - No, Michael. [shouts] [gasping] No. [screaming] [sorrowful music] The fuck did you just do? - I just saved your life. [coughing] - [Tara] You gave him exactly what he wanted. He could have led us to Auteur. - Duane, I wanna thank you for bringing us the final scene of our mimesis. - Who are you? [foreboding music] What do you want? - You see, I'm not interested in taking credit, Duane. I'm interested in the final scene of this movie. All horror films typically have only two endings. One is nice and neat. The villain dies. The hero wins and maybe even gets the girl. And all the world's at peace, and the maggots can leave the theater feeling happy, satisfied. The second is not so neat or tidy. No one quite knows who won, and horror lives on, patiently waiting for its next victim. Pay attention to this next part. You have a choice to make, Duane. Whether to cut and run for it, or face the authorities for the horrific crimes you both committed. I for one can't wait to see the ending you choose. And cut! [dramatic music] Edward, let's give Duane a preview of the next mimesis. [creaking] [shrieking] - Oh hell no. [suspenseful music] [uplifting rock music] [singing in foreign language]
