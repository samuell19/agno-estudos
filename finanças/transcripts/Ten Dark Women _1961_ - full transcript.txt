Daiei Film Co., Ltd. Production Ten Women in Black Produced by Masaichi Nagata Screenplay by Natto Wada Starring Fujiko Yamamoto Mariko Miyagi Tamao Nakamura Kyoko Kishida Eiji Funakoshi Keiko Kishi Tomo Nagai Shiro Otsuji Koichi Ito Juzo Itami Hana Hajime and the Crazy Cats Directed by Kon Ichikawa You! I only took back what was mine in the first place! That hurts! Stop! What are you doing?! She and the man were in on it together. I'm an actress. I was fooled by an amateur. It was like I was the one who was murdered. I was the one who was fooled and murdered. Me? I'm the tenth woman. Why don't you count for yourselves? You're all quite easy to see from up here. Look, there are only nine women down there. - Are you leaving already? - I'm sorry about last night. I fell right to sleep. - Another meeting? - It's not a meeting, but I can't be late. We need to talk. I've been working late every night recently. I was finally finished at 3:00 last night, and I came, even though I didn't want to disturb you. You said you wanted to talk. I was thinking about quitting acting. Let's talk about that when we have more time. You're not surprised, are you? Look at my face. I just woke up. My mind is still fuzzy. I've lost confidence in myself. - I want to die. - You always get this way. I'm serious. - You don't believe me. - I believe you. I do. I'll come over tonight. I forgot, I have to work tonight. I don't understand it why you say such things, Miss Ichiko Ishinoshita. You're a veteran of Western theater. Many say you're the most talented actress in the country. You have a bad reputation at the station. Who told you that? Does it surprise you? I just don't believe it. - I heard you'll be fired. - That can't be right! I suppose not. I thought you were in a hurry? I am. See you later. Oh, I forgot. Yabata's Shooting Star opens tonight. We're taping. Then, you're off today. See you. - Can I come out now? - Sure. I heard him leave. Can I use the bathroom? It's already nine. He came at four, so he's been here... for five hours. It was very enlightening. I learned what Kaze is like when he's around other women. Go ahead. I hope you don't mind if I sit down. It was the first time I've hid in the wardrobe... of a woman that Kaze was cheating on me with! Not to be rude, but please leave. I'm tired. What was the point of setting this trap on Kaze? Nothing in particular. You hid us in your wardrobe. Actresses sure do have chutzpah. - No, it's not. I do it all the time. - Liar! Actresses are born liars. What are you talking about! You barged in here in the middle of the night and when Kaze came, you hid in my wardrobe. He immediately fell asleep, and when I peeked in the wardrobe to send you home, - you were both snoring. - Really? You're thin-skinned. You've had it in for me ever since you stumbled on me walking with Kaze. When I was walking on the stage with Kaze, we were just talking about work. You were helping with the set for the show, and you happened to see us. You fell off a ladder and dropped a chandelier. Is that how you broke your arm? It's all Kaze's wife's fault. She must be a cold-hearted woman. Have a seat, I'll make coffee. So long as you're here. I can't just let you leave like this. Have a seat. - Good, we wanted to talk to you a little more. - She's right. We came here because we thought you could help us. I'll tell you what Kaze's wife said. She advised me to pay him no mind. She didn't care that he was running around on her. Do you think he's a wonderful man? - No. - Not at all. That's why I don't worry about him. If I did, I'd injure myself at work. You're right. I have nothing to lose. He has no shadow... like Peter Pan. In a way, he's the perfect modern man. If it weren't for the trappings of the modern age, he'd disappear into thin air. He's like a telephone pole. But he's a human being. His wife said not to worry about him, but what am I supposed to do? He's not the only one you have to think about. So don't worry about him. I can quit my job if I want. If I can be together with you, I don't care if I'm in the spotlight. - So, what do you want me to do? - You need a home. Your wife and everyone else has a job. They're all using you to advance their careers. There's no one... who's willing to sacrifice herself to provide you with a nice warm home. I think you're lonely, that's why you keep going from girl to girl. I think you're overanalyzing this. Why are you so interested in me? I'm actually pretty ordinary. But you have to do something. You can't just go on like this. You have nothing to worry about. I'm not the kind of man who's going to make a nuisance of himself. Don't you understand? Don't worry yourself. Work is waiting, I'll see you later. Curry rice! Excuse me. I wanted to leave it in my room, but I'd be in the jackpot if I lost it. I'm sorry to have bothered you. - You did that. - Did what? Models for commercials are always pushy. So what if I do model for commercials? I don't care if you play dumb. I need to talk to you, meet me in the back. In the back? - There are too many people here. - Cut it out, the both of you. I'll meet you. We'll sort it out then. She's picking on me because I'm a printer. Who said that commercial actresses are better than printers? Nobody said that. Does your belly hurt? I'm sorry. You coward, I see you've brought back up. This isn't just about the two of us. It's about Kaze. That's why I brought everyone involved. These girls are all... You didn't know? Spinster! Spinster? I'm not that old yet. And if you didn't have Kaze backing you up, you wouldn't be acting in commercials. Kaze didn't get me this job. But I can't speak for everyone. What are you talking about? I work in advertising, and I'm not even directly connected with Kaze. I wonder. I heard that you could pull his strings. I heard that you got him to move you from reception to the administrative department. Young women are so shameless these days. Right? It's disgusting how you're trying to lure Goto over to your side. I don't know anything about it. Here, take her. Cut it out, you look ridiculous. Stop it, already. Someone's coming. What would people say if they saw you two like that? What are we going to do? You're hair's a mess. Leave it alone, they'll fix it in the hair and makeup department. You fell down several times; you'll have bruises. If you think this through, there's no real problem. Kaze doesn't mean anything to me. I have no idea what that man is thinking. Maybe he's just trash. What do you expect when everyone does everything for him? You're right, absolutely right. Whenever I see another girl fawning over him, it rips me up inside. Even if we broke it off with him, he'd have a new set of mistresses in no time flat. True enough, he's a kind man. This conversation is going in circles. A vicious circle. Who is it? - Madam, there's a visitor here to see you. - Me? - Are you the wife of the producer Kaze? - Yes. I'm sorry to intrude like this. - My name is Miwako... - Please come in! This way. You must be thirsty. Can I fix you a drink? I work in the printing of TV scripts, and I owe your husband a great debt for his help. Not at all. On the contrary, Kaze is indebted to you. Have you heard of me? I'm so happy you dropped by. I hope that we can be as good of friends as you are with Kaze. I know this is a bold proposal, but I'd like to ask you to divorce Kaze. Divorce him? This has become rather awkward; I think you have misjudged me. Did Kaze propose to you? No, never. My husband died when my son was in middle school. I was at a complete loss about what to do. Mr. Kaze helped me get a job in TV, my printing store started making money, and now I even have a little squirreled away. He's a very kind, good man. He is a very kind man. That's why he has such a long string of lovers. Madam, he currently has six, aside from me. And that's only the ones I know about. I know about eight. Counting you. I'm friends with some of them. The fact that he's kind to everyone means that he's not kind to anyone. You're right. You're absolutely right. I can't count the number of times that I wanted to divorce him. But divorcing him won't change anything, so long as I let it bother me. If he told me there was another woman he wanted to marry, I'd happily oblige him. That's why I opened this restaurant. It would give me something else to occupy my mind. You must love him very much. Married couples are linked by fate. Don't you feel any responsibility for your husband's actions? I wish someone would kill him. I don't think you can count on him suddenly dropping dead from the flu. It's open. Here is fine. Have a seat. I don't have much time, so I'll be frank. I'm sorry for this, I know you're busy. Don't worry. What are you going to be frank about? Have one. I'm going on six years in this department. Three years in production. You want a raise? Actually, yes, but that's not why I wanted to talk. I want to be an independent producer and I've studied very hard. - You're getting married? - I can't work like this anymore. It might not be appropriate to speak to the bureau chief about such matters, but I didn't know who else to turn to. If there's a squabble in the editing department, it's my responsibility. It's not a squabble. I'm the only one who's angry. Is this about someone in particular? A man? A woman? It's a man. Is it love? No, I'm not interested in him. And yet he's on your mind. For now, could you rearrange my duties? - Is it Kaze? - Will you? Do you think women were cut out for the TV business? Are you firing me? Don't be so defensive. There are always men in a TV studio who are not very serious. Are you talking about Kaze? I'm not naming names. There are a lot of them. This is what it's like. Women can say what they want, but they're better off at home. What happens when women marry men that work at TV studios? Men who work at TV studios don't elect to be husbands. The way it works in the modern age is... people work to live up to their full potential, despite limited time. Yeah, that sounds good on paper. I don't think it's a delusion. Sooner or later, women get married and have children. Childbirth confirms the power women already know they have. Men are tragic. We can't give birth. We don't know how to raise children. That's why we drown ourselves in our work. Are you a prisoner of your job? In TV, there's no end, only a series of climaxes. When you finish a project, there's no time to reflect on the results. It's actually difficult and awful. I admit I have methods to cope. But it sure is hard to do this job and retain your humanity. I'm looking for the bureau chief! Yeah! What? There you are. The executive director wants to talk to you. Company men are all the same. I'm practicing, I tend to choke on the air. Shouldn't you be on set? I have six minutes. I'm on at 4:00, 19:30, and 21:00. I slip on my words every time the camera's on me. I've never had that problem. You're terrific. I always do my makeup at home. I thought I might find you here. I'm generally here when I'm not on set. - Let's shake. - No. - Why? The doctor said I have a skin disease. My fingers itch and I want to tear the skin off my palms. - He said it might be scabies. - I don't care. - It's contagious. - I don't care if I catch it. This is the first time anyone has ever loved me. I can feel the blood rushing through my body. Thanks for the dinner. Don't mention it, I'm just glad you enjoyed yourself. I understand that you're going to the US... to introduce traditional Japanese kabuki to them. I think that's a wonderful thing you're doing. - I sometimes see Mr. Kaze in the studio. - Oh, you're too kind. Please give your husband my regards. He's so busy, I haven't seen him for quite some time. So, if you see him first, please give him my regards. I hope everything is all right here. Please come in. Is anyone here? Now, where were we? The plan to kill Kaze, I mean. The place will be here at Katyusha Restaurant. You said that it was perfect because no one lives here, and I agreed. We still have to decide the day and the weapon. Oh, yes... That's right. How about sleeping pills? It's hard to get the dosage right. He could just sleep like a baby and wake up grouchy. A pistol would be good if it weren't for the noise. Noise wouldn't be a problem here. I don't like the way a pistol looks. They look like they're made for killing. I saw a movie where someone was suffocated with a pillow. That's good. It's beautiful in an odd way. But it requires incredible strength. You have to push down on the pillow until you gush sweat. It was a French actor. I forget his name. Are we really going to kill him? You'll do it? - No, I meant you. - Yuck, I don't want to. Do you think everyone will come? They'll come. They already said that they want to help you string up your husband. Everybody's curious just to hear what you'll say. I'm just interested in what choice words they have for him. Nine women, each with a butcher knife stabbing in turn, would be refreshing. That sounds good... But it's ten women. Really? I had no idea. I know, the makeup artist. Which one? She's pretty, but her face is sad. She looks a little like a Siamese cat. What's so funny? - I figured as much. No, not her. - Then who? Do you know the receptionist Nanae? Her?! That's crossing the line. I feel bad for Kaze. And you're to blame! You're his first mistress, and you just let him have more and more lovers. Just a second, who are you calling a "mistress"? I'm sorry, I meant a "lover". It's a wonder none of them have gotten pregnant. All of his lovers seem capable of bearing children. When my first child was stillborn, I found out I could no longer have children. He made it so that he couldn't have children either. That was kind. I know. He's such a kind man. If there was one woman who would satisfy him, I'd gladly hand him over. I believe that from the bottom of my heart. Do you want something to drink? I can get you a gin and tonic or something. This will do. I'll have it straight, too. If he dies in a traffic accident or something, you should change the restaurant's name. "Katyusha" is so old-fashioned. It was my idea. It means "resurrection". Were you hoping to resurrect your relationship with your husband? Isn't it romantic? Here's to the resurrection of happy couples. Thank you. You'll catch cold if you don't wear a bathrobe. You can't sleep. Get up. Is it time to go? It's 2:30. I'd just dozed off. That wasn't nice. I was snoozing pleasantly. You said we'd talk. We'll talk, get in bed. This is important; I'm not talking in bed. - I'm sorry; you must be sleepy. - I'm all right. I want this more than anything. Please marry me. When you said you were worried, I thought you were talking about your job. This house would be a good place to run the business, but it's not my house. I talked to my son about it, and he said he wouldn't mind if I remarried. He knows how much I've suffered, so he's very understanding. He said that you're a good man, and he wouldn't mind having you as a father. What are you talking about?! I'm a married... If you don't, you'll be killed. Killed?! Me?! - Yes, we're already planning it. - Who's "we"? The whole thing isn't final yet. We haven't decided on the weapon. We're thinking about a butcher knife, poison, or a pistol. - That's why. - This is a shakedown. Honey, you should take this a little more seriously. You shouldn't think such dark thoughts. You're busy. You'll overwork yourself and get sick. Your body won't be able to keep up. Your wife had you pegged. She said she'd be happy to give up this plan if you'd marry someone. My wife?! She's in on this? You're not cut out to work at a busy TV station. But so long as I have the printing company, everything will be fine. You could run the printing company? Are you leaving? I forgot something at the office. It's the middle of the night. You don't want to marry me, do you? I'm glad you woke me up. Nogami must be tired of waiting for me. Nogami's a man: there's nothing to worry about. I can't understand that man. I hope someone really does kill him! Wake up. Hey! Get up! Turn off the light. Get up, already. I'm trying to sleep. You're back. I'm glad you're home. I've caught a cold. God, I'm late. Oh, it's you! I hope I didn't wake you when I dropped the bucket. - Where's Futaba? - She was gone when I got here. It's Tuesday, so I'm going to clean the place up. "Please don't throw the broken milk bottles in the garbage. "Please make sure to clean under the bed. "Thursday is laundry day, so please come early. "The laundry won't dry by nightfall, so..." - Not everyone is here yet. - I know. Forget about it. Gee, we're busy. Hey, it's me. Me. Is the woman of the house in? No? She went to the department store to buy a cup. I see. I'll call back. We're going to be in the soup if everyone doesn't show up. We have to make a decision, or we won't be able to tag a decent actor. Are you talking about the casting for Windy Theater the week after next? What's on my plate for tonight? - The Weekly Gang is taking center stage tonight. - I know that much. I'm going to see Hashizumi. Take care of the script for Windy Theater for three weeks from now. What do you want to do about the week after next? I think everyone should be here soon. I won't be long. Hey, Kaze, come here! What's up? I was awoken in the wee hours this morning by Marubishi. They said that the film for the commercial was unusable, and you hadn't apologized. - Really? - I told you about this. They said that they want three minutes of air time on another day as compensation. Hey, Nogami, did you call Marubishi for me? - No, you didn't tell me to. - This is bad, they must be furious. - I told you all about it. - Hello, Marubishi? Please connect me to the advertising department. They didn't have to call up the bureau chief over this. I clearly told you. Hello, is this the advertising department? Is Mr. Ozaki in? This is Kaze from VTV. It's too late now. - Hey, Kaze, we're leaving. Are you coming? - Where to? We need some extra location footage for Sunny Japan. Oh, yeah, next week. Hold on. Mr. Ozaki, thanks for yesterday. You idiot! I think that was a woman driving that car. I think there was a woman in there. The car was full of young people. Do you think they were trying to kill me? Why would they do that? I don't know. - Oh, you're back. - Is casting finished? The vehicles department called and said a car was available. Did you put in a request? Oh, yeah. Are we going to see Hashizumi? - Has the cast of Windy Theater been finalized? - More or less. Give it to me, I have to tell the newspapers. - I don't know, ask advertising. - Tell me. - I'm busy. - Just starting? - Hey. Why are you in such a hurry? The reading for The Weekly Gang is at 18:00. Are you going home already? I wish. I also wish they had a better girl working reception. Isn't Kita's show on at eight? I'd expect you'd watch it. I've never watched our shows at the station. TV is for at home with a glass of fine whisky. I've never watched a production myself. I only feel like a human being when I'm with myself. I watch it then. Good night. No. 2, Camera #2 can you hear me? Please respond. Are you going to close in with the camera? That's the ticket, hold it there. Is it fixed? - It's still too white. - It's fine. OK, it's fine. Hey, floorman, what the hell are you doing?! Make sure the actors understand my cues! You're going to screw up the show! - What is that guy thinking?! - Is everyone here? The reading is done, we're blocking now. - How are you for time? - It's tight. What are you eating? I'm hungry. Pork on rice? - You want me to order something for you? What do you want? - Pork on rice. Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw! One more! You were late! Stop! You were off tempo. One more time up to there. And go! Cue sound. Cue. Cue. That's a wrap. That'll do. Now for real. Rehearsal's finished. Three minute break. Three minutes... Three-minute break. Don't leave the stage. Do you have the costume? - It's too short. - Dress him. She's hasn't said a word for the last couple of days. Not a peep. She probably got into a fight with someone. On air in one minute. Is Toshi on the floor? - The week after next? - I thought she helped out on the 03:00-05:00 shift. - Goto is off today. - Really, why? She busted her wrist, but I thought it was better now. She probably caught a cold or something. 30 seconds! 15 seconds! - 10 seconds! - It looks a little dark. - It's too dark. - 5 seconds! Start from camera #2. On air! We Japanese have to speak properly. - Dummkopf, don't be so formal. - No, we are... - So long as people understand. - You friggin' media hog! - You halfwit, quit yammering! - Oh, shut up! - Give him a punch! Just shut up and let me talk! What is that? Oh, it's the moon. - Hey. - Good evening. What department are you in? Momoko Momose, of the Stardust Revue. It was my first time on TV today. I was shaking so bad, I came up here to calm down. - The moon is beautiful tonight. - That it is. - You look exhausted. - Nope. - Sleepy? - Not at all. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. I'm thinking about all kinds of things. - You're quite a girl. - No, I'm just daydreaming. That feels nice. When I think of someone hugging me, it calms me. Like being in my father's arms. Who are you? - Kaze, of the editing department. - What do you do? - I'm a producer. - You're a big shot. Not really. Don't you want me to? Your lips are cold. I've never kissed a man before. Do you need a ride home? Unless your father will be angry, seeing you escorted by a man? My father's dead. If you ever need anything, you can count on me. Thank you. Oh, I completely forgot. - You still have work? - I have to make a call. I'll see you later. I have to talk to my wife. I have to catch her. Oh, you're still here. A car is waiting, are you coming? - Where to? - The car will be packed, but we can probably squeeze you in. - We're going home. - OK, let's go. - I'm sorry, we're closed. - It's me. Oh, Kaze. What do you need? The restaurant's changed. Did you fix up the place? You were sneezing up a storm last night. How's your cold? Oh, yeah. I've been busy, so I sort of forgot about it. I guess I'm better. You're not human. You sure are busy. Not as busy as you. - Can we talk? - Go ahead. I think it's some kind of a joke, but I heard you were trying to have me killed. Who told you that? That's not the point. - What makes you think it's a joke? - I can't believe it's true. - Why not? - It would be murder. What can you do? I don't know why women can't keep their mouths shut. Who told you? Look, I don't care if I'm killed, but if you're the one who kills me, you'll be up for murder. Who said I'd be the one to do it? Then, who? - There are ten of us. - Ten?! Are you in your right mind? The ten of us talked it over. We're serious. With ten women, we can commit the perfect crime. Why ten? Are there more? There has to be 100 women at the station. I'm friendly with 30-40 of them. You're carrying on with 40 women? It's nothing like that. I'm not that appealing to women. I'm also quite sure I wouldn't have the energy. So why do you have nine mistresses? - I don't know if it's nine... - I know these nine women! I'm not so sure. I'm not playing dumb, it's just difficult to count. I don't see the difference of whether I have a physical relationship with a woman or not. What do you mean? Once, I was running in the rain because I didn't have an umbrella. - Where were you going? - A caf? in front of the station. It was an odd moment when I didn't have any work. I ran into a girl from PR who had one, so we went and had a cup of tea together... and then went for a walk. What I'm trying to say is... You mean Toshiko? What about Shio? Shio? Oh, the model for commercials. It was hot that day. The AC was out. Her costume was drenched and her makeup was running. She didn't look good on camera. I felt bad for her and took her to a hotel that had AC, and she was so happy, and then... So if it hadn't been raining, and the AC hadn't been broken, you wouldn't have taken them as lovers? You make it sound so suspicious. But, actually, yes, probably not. In any event, tonight the moon was beautiful, and... You met another girl? No, I stopped before anything could happen. If I stop seeing these women, will you let me live? I thought you were too good for me. You've done such a good job with the restaurant. I just have a sunny disposition. I'm not good for anything. Why would you want to kill me? I haven't caused any problems, so what's the fuss? I want to kill you because you say things like that. Why? Am I supposed to understand that? Can you stay by my side all day long? If it's just for one day, I imagine I can arrange something with the station. - No, everyday. - I can't. - I want you to sit here next to me. - I won't get paid. I'll worry about money. Are you going to be the breadwinner? I can't let you do that. How could I hold my head up? This is more important than your job or your pride. If we just sit here together, the restaurant will go bust. - I don't care about the restaurant. - How would we eat? We'll beg for food together. That's why you want to kill me? Yes. I do not understand this. I'm too busy. I'm tired. Work isn't fun anymore. You really are tired, aren't you? I have an idea: if the ten of you haven't decided who will kill me, - what if you do it? - Why me? - It will just be for show. - They'll all be here at the restaurant. You're going to kill me at the restaurant? It will pack more of a punch if you do it in front of them. You pretend to kill me and I'll pretend to die. It'll work. I'll disappear for a month. What about work? They won't let you. Deliver a medical note to personnel. The station won't make me work if I'm sick. All I have to do is thank them for the month off. I can't believe you. No one's going to kill you. What? I thought so. It was just a joke. I'm surprised you believed me. Still, it would be a good gag. Making the joke come true would give everyone a surprise. They'd scatter like mice. Let's do it. It would be a nice way to end it with them. Really? I think that would be the natural result. - I wonder if we could pull it off. - We'll plan it all out. Closed for Employee Holiday There are live rounds in it. Damn, be careful! Where'd you get it? It wasn't hard, even with bullets. Do we have to use real bullets? I don't think anyone would be convinced by blanks. Shoot at the column, and I'll fall down. It'll work. Leave it there, I'll get it later. I got some blanks, just in case. Is there muzzle flash with blanks? - We use them at the station. - Let's use blanks. These don't always fire. It could blow the whole thing. Maybe it is dangerous... It would certainly be a mess if she hit me. I guess I will use blanks. - How many have come? - I think seven. For blood. It's ripe, be careful. I decided to use... I got a cake for you. You shouldn't have. - Is everyone here? - Yes. - And Kaze? - Not yet. Drat! I only bought ten cakes. I forgot to count Kaze. It'll be OK. Could you take this? Hey, the pistol... Oh, so glad you could come. Everyone's already here. I think you're last. My husband just arrived. I'll lock up and we can all go upstairs. I want to go home. What's the matter, are you ill? I'll get some medicine. - Honey, check to see what medicine we have. - Don't bother! Thank you for inviting me. I was very excited to come last night. I was bravely thinking of all the possibilities. But when I saw the two of you together at the entrance, I knew that I couldn't speak ill of a man in front of his wife. Kaze has a difficult life, and... I'm going home. You're so kind. But Kaze says that he's ready. - Kaze, show her upstairs. - Um, you... I already know. Will somebody please say something? It wouldn't have been right to miss this, and I wouldn't want anyone thinking that I had any secrets. That's why I rearranged my schedule to come, even though I'm quite busy. Now, you'll have to excuse me. Honey, the pistol still... We all need to talk, before anyone leaves. Is that real? It is. But it isn't loaded, is it? The bullets are real too. Look. You said you didn't want to use a pistol. Honey, the bullets... Do you really intend to kill me?! Do you realize the unpleasant position I'm in? I've assembled all the women my husband has slept with. Why do I have to be here? This isn't easy for me either! This is all your fault! Don't touch him! He's bleeding. He's badly injured. He's dead. - I aimed for his heart. - He's dead?! Let's get out of here. Go. Hurry. I'm going to get married. It will be a happy, healthy marriage. I've decided to start over. Until today, Kaze was a burden to me, and today, his wife was too. My plans are shot to hell. I had nothing to do with what happened today. Me neither. She planned all along to involve us in this. She fooled us all into coming over. I hope you all are ready. Our fingerprints are all over the table upstairs. Our fingerprints? I'll wipe it down. Then you won't involve us in this? - No, I won't. - I'm sorry. We've nothing to apologize for. This was between her and Kaze. What are you doing all standing around? Let's go home and cook up an alibi. I'm going. I don't ever want to see you again. I know, I won't talk to you or the rest of the women ever again. I don't hate you. Kaze wouldn't be dead if he had listened to me. You wouldn't be a murderess. I won't ever say anything to get you into trouble. That's the only thing that I can do for him now. I'd be happy to turn myself in for the crime, but I couldn't do that to my son. I'd do anything while there's still time. I'd be your friend and walk you to the police station. I'm overwhelmed by your generosity. I'll think about it and surrender myself in my time. You fool, why did you kill him? It was only fun when we talked about it. Murder will only bring you misery. You became a criminal for him? You had nothing to gain. Futaba, please let me see his face one last time. Life truly is fleeting. He died so easily. Give it up. She's a stranger now, and the polite thing is to leave her alone. Goodbye. Stay strong. OK, get up already. I knew they were blanks. I didn't have a chance to tell you. You thought the bullets were real. I was afraid that you really wanted to kill me. I wish you had put real bullets in the gun. Don't hate me so much. I saw you open the cylinder and change the bullets. You were thinking of me. When I thought of how much I still loved you. I'm sorry I made you so nervous. None of them said a word, and nothing went as planned. I didn't know what to expect. - I'm ashamed. - Why? For both you and me. I thought it went well. Everyone fled thinking I had died. I'm lucky. Don't cry. - You're back. - Hello. At that moment, I didn't believe for a second that Kaze wanted to live. "Female CEO mysteriously commits suicide on 9:50 of the 16th. "In the Bunkyo Ward of Tokyo, 38-year-old design printing company president Miwako Migishi... "overdosed on sleeping pills, died in her home and was discovered by her employees. "A police investigation failed to turn up any note and her family was unable to account for the action. "Police ruled it suicide due to her wearing a white funeral robe." I've read it over a dozen times and I still can't believe there wasn't a note. If there was a note, it would've said in the article. Maybe they announced the suicide so they could secretly investigate us. That's why there's nothing about it in the paper. Hey, you look good as a cop! I always do The Weekly Gang, so I feel funny in this getup. Hello, Katyusha Restaurant. Hello? Is this Futaba? Are you alone? Are the police watching you? Who are you? I was one of the women involved in the incident. Don't call here, I've taken care of everything. What are the police up to? Have you been arrested? Yes, I'm very busy and haven't had any time to leave the restaurant. Um... what did you do with the body? It's in the closet. The closet?! It's been two weeks! In the closet?! Don't worry; I've taken measures to make sure it won't go bad. Let everything play out as we agreed. Goodbye. So, he's still alive? Why did you trick us? Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you tell us he was still alive? I was so frightened, I thought I was losing my mind. Don't you care that you did this to us? It's strange: you were angry when I killed him. Now you blame me for letting him live. You can have him. Who wants him? I understand better than anyone that he can't be trusted. But I've also come to understand something else... That man is sick in the head now. Not a one of you has given a moment's thought... to how hard it's been for me to hide him since that day. All he does is gobble down the food I bring him and sleep. I'll show you where he's hiding. He just sleeps all day in that filthy room. He worked awfully hard. Then when he's better, he'll report back to work? That won't do; it will be just like before. Can't we do something to keep him at home? That's Futaba's responsibility. Look at what's become of me: I'm as thin as a rail. We've all lost weight. If you want to lock him up, do it yourselves. You got some nerve, lady. - You take him. - You must be joking. In any event, I'm getting a divorce, so I'm not getting involved. You're running away?! Dry your hair; you'll catch cold. If this was all for spectacle, you should have let me do it. I'd enjoy playing the killer in an absurd comedy. I'd have done it better. It's frustrating that I was stuck playing one of the dupes. I'm his wife; it was only natural that I do it. - Granted, I wasn't very good at it. - Now it's my turn. I'll take him off your hands. Kaze? In return, let me do with him as I please. You're a freak. Yeah, maybe so. - Are you really going to divorce him? - I'll do it tomorrow. Then it's settled. I'm going to be responsible for keeping him out of sight. Any complaints? I think that you're forgetting that I really believed that Kaze was dead... and committed suicide over it. "Does anyone have any complaints?" she says! I can't speak anymore. You can't hear me! Heartless bitch! I almost never go to sneak previews. I ran into Kaze at the theater. He was surprised and slinked off. He was with Ichiko Ishinoshita. Waka said he saw him when he was on location in Hayama. He also said that he was with Ichiko. I heard. He's like the Loch Ness Monster. Isn't Ichiko planning to quit? I didn't realize they were so close. Kaze wants to quit too. - Seriously? - He's on sick leave and is swinging around town. What else am I to believe? - Please circulate a memo that he's leaving the company. - This is bad. Mafune and Mizowake both have heart conditions, and Shirai has some kind of nervous disorder. - Hello! - Fancy meeting you here! - I hear everything's coming up roses for you. - ...Going home. Right this way. It was nice having a beer the other day. - Have a seat. - Sir, the executive director called to say that he was leaving, so you should you should call him early if you need him. Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I have a mess to clean up. Get him something cold to drink. I'll do it. This is heavenly. Hey, get me a glass of water. Take it. I think I have enough money so we can live together - - without working. - Sounds good. I got a good price on my condo, so I still have money left over after buying this house. We'll loaf around this old house and not do anything. - Sounds good. - We can go into town if it gets dull. No can do - I might run into someone from the station again. Maybe I should just go back to work. - You don't belong there anymore. - Why? The station sent a notification of resignation form to your house, and your wife forwarded it to me. I filled it out and returned it. Of all the stupid...! I'm not quitting. I already sent it. I'll tell them it was a misunderstanding. You're ostensibly sick. How do you plan to explain... that you've been spotted gallivanting around town with me? I'll think of something. And pretending to have been murdered? - You put on quite a show. - No one will say anything. - They wouldn't talk, even if I was really dead. - I'll talk. Why? It's just fodder for the weeklies. My name won't be worth a dime. A person has died... Because of what you did. Miwako Migishi. You forgot? Let's forget her. Her son is a capable high school student. He can run the printing shop. She was stupid to kill herself. She only hurt people by doing it. Where are you going? Futaba will think of something. - You're divorced. - Cut it out. Do you take pleasure in trying to surprise me with bizarre stories? Go to city hall and check. The paperwork is in order. I didn't agree to get divorced, ergo, I'm still married. The decision was made by mutual consent. I will tell them that it was executed without my knowing. "It will just be fodder for the weeklies." Does Futaba really want to divorce me? It was her idea. Futaba said she calculated how much you spent... setting her up in the restaurant and would pay you back every last penny. Impossible... I don't believe it. Hello, it's me. Yes, I really quit. No, not just the revue. I'm not acting anymore. Yes, I regret that I won't be able to perform on the radio. It was complicated, but this is the decision I made. The revue should be making an announcement soon. Thanks for calling, goodbye. You've quit as an actress? So? I bet you thought I wasn't a quitter. You're a fool. You're right: I'm a fool! Just because you quit your job doesn't mean that I have to quit mine. I made a promise: Never to let you go back to work. Who did you promise? Your mistresses. So you planned this whole thing?! Not all of it. It's funny. I agreed to lock you up, and then everyone started to feel bad. They agreed to all chip in to support you. They said that they'd continue to pay, no matter their salaries. They didn't want to be indebted to anyone if I ever set you free. They're going to pay ?1,000 a month each. They'll stop paying if you get married. So the nine of us together will pay ?9,000. I'll give you an allowance, but keep it a secret. You're not human! You're devils! No, we're not. I've told people before that you're a non-entity. It can happen to anyone who gets caught up in the modern social system. They become quite skilled in walking quickly and office work, but they lose their ability to connect with other people. You have nothing to offer a woman. But you still have the shape of a man. That's why you were erased. If that's the case, it's not my fault. Blame the modern social system. I'm a victim. We can't kill the social system. We can't kill TV. But we can kill people and other animals. Don't cry. I love you very much. Although I have to admit it's strange. But it's the truth. Everyone abducted you because they loved you. I removed every obstacle preventing us from being together. Your job, my job... If we're together and in love, there will be no reason to cry. You're wrong, you can't decide this for me. Let's have children. You can still have them, can't you? Can't it be reversed with a minor surgery? Once we have children, maybe we'll both feel like working again. This isn't about children. You don't understand anything. I want to work. My dearly departed parents dressed me up in pretty clothes, but that was the only love they showed me. I never wanted to be an actress, it was just something that happened. I suspect that it was the same for you. Your job at the station wasn't more important than life itself. You just plugged away at it, without questioning. Why do you work? Why do you live? What is your purpose in life? Have you ever thought about it? Men have to carve out a niche to work, they can't have children? He'd be lazy. He'd be a bum. I'm not that kind of a man. I may as well be dead as just do nothing here. So that's how it is? People are all the same. We both speak Japanese, but you can't understand what I'm saying. I can only wonder why you're so sad. Let me have my job back. No, I promised. Please. I have an idea. Nobody actually rubbed you out. You can't work at the station, but this is a big country. You could start all over again. It would be a healthier, at least. Absolutely not! Forget it! You're not leaving me with much of a choice. So long as we're going to live together, let's try to get along. Dammit! I'm a man! There's no way we'll get along! She's so cruel. She went upstairs and left you crying. If you think about it, you have no one to blame but yourself. If you had agreed to marry me, it would have never come to this. It breaks my heart to look at you. I wish someone really would kill you. Then we could be together. You have to hold on for a little while longer. Don't cry, be strong. Goodbye. Don't break things. I'd like to call this party to a close. I'd like to end this with a word from Miss Ishinoshita. I'm flattered that you held such a beautiful party... for a second-rate actress like me, particularly since the revue has so little money. I will never forget your kindness. I'm choking up. I will always consider the revue my home. Thank you. Why are you here? What's so strange about me coming to your farewell party? After all, we've known each other for so long. And they're all my friends. It's hard to express how grateful we are. Thanks to you, I'm to be married this autumn. I'm not a rival anymore. We've all become good friends. Isn't the missus in high spirits? I'm not "the missus" - I'm making good money now. I bet men would like to marry you. I'm finished with men. I don't want to say, "Oh, you're a friend of my husband's," ever again. I knew a woman whose husband died, and suddenly she started wearing dazzling kimono and going out more. She died shortly after. I felt so bad that she never knew love. Better not to know love if it's at the sacrifice of a normal life. That's right. Thank you for coming. How is he? - He's fine. - Take care. The End
