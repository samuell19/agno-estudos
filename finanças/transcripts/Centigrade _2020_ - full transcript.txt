Matt? Wake up. My door, it won't open. Matt, wake up. What? What are you doing? My door won't open. Try to get your door open. Okay, okay. Okay, hold on. What're you doing? Get it going. I think we're snowed under. It's just some ice. If it were just ice, there would be some visibility, wouldn't there be? Well, at least we'll get the engine going and it'll help warm us up and, and loosen the snow. You're gonna flood it. There's nothing to flood. Shit. Shit! Okay, don't worry, Shit! don't worry. Breathe, it's okay. Got a shot through the back. Matt. Shit! Matt. Just don't worry. Ah shit. Matt? Can you just give me one second, please? I'm sorry, baby, I'm just trying to get my head around this, okay? I knew we should've kept on driving. I knew it, I said it! Okay, can we calm down, please? We should've kept on driving at least another hour or two to get to a village or something. It was freezing rain, in the middle of the night, should we have kept going? We're so fucked. Can you not be so defeatist? What're you doing? Getting my phone. Come on. Shit. The battery is at half life. Let me see. Wait. Come on, come on. Matt, give me the phone. Hold on one minute. Matt, just give me the phone. Matt! We need to save the battery. Can we please not argue? Okay, I'm sorry. I just need a few minutes and I will get us out of this, okay? Okay. Let's see where we are. What food do we have? Chicken, cheese, and a herring sandwich. Here we go, here we go. Okay. All right. All right, we're on this road and we're somewhere between here and here, okay? Someone is going to pass by. Can we please not panic? Hmm. Okay. Never know when ice is tight. What? Shit. What's wrong? My back. Oh shit. Okay, you know what? Come back here. There's more space. Come on, come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. You want your legs up here? Yeah. How she doing? She's fine. She keeps on kicking, she's okay. How about you? Fine, this is, uh, this is absurd. Yeah. What're you doing? The rental guy said there was a, there was a roadside kit. Okay, can we get... Oh yeah. Two, three, four. Here we go. There we go. Yay. And we have light. Yes. Now we could clearly see the shit storm we're in. No, this is good, it means we have air. I'm kidding. How is that? It's really good. Yeah? Yeah. Want some? Shit. Matt? I have to pee. Okay. Okay. Okay, um. What are you doing? I got something. Yeah, yeah. Just ball this up and go on it. You're kidding. It's what my mother did when she was bedridden. I had to keep changing the towels. That's disgusting. You're okay? Sorry. I just peed on a towel. 12 days and only two bottles of water. That's what we have to survive on. What about these, um, these chocolates? No, we're not eating those. That's the only thing my sister's asked for. So any ideas how we're getting out of here with this stuff? I don't think we should get out of here. Matt, we have to try and get out of here, we can't just stay here. I think we should break the window and use it to dig. I think that's a really bad idea. Why? Because we don't know what's out there. Look, I'm not some kind of an expert or anything but I think we should stay right here. That's not really much of a plan. Okay then try your phone again. I did, twice. We're gonna freeze in here. And you don't think we're gonna freeze out there? Come on, at least we're enclosed. We've, we've got candlelight, we have blankets for warmth, we have body heat. And what if no one is out there looking for us? What if it hasn't even stopped snowing yet? If we don't show up to your book signing... I can't believe you. What? What is so wrong with that? I can't fucking believe this. What's wrong with it If the weather is as bad is that you should've, as you say it is, or else we wouldn't be then who's gonna show uC in this situation at all! to your book signing anyway? This is insane. No, what's insane is traipsing around the frozen wilderness, with a pregnant lady following the North Star, hoping we're gonna find a Fairfield Inn or something. I just need you to trust me, okay? Okay. Okay then. We're gonna need more layers. Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Did you eat? I'm not even hungry. What, shit, shit. What, what is it? Fuck! Calm down. You have to put the cap back on. I'm sorry, it was an accident. You just... I just what? I just what, Matt? Nothing. Nothing. Great. Great. Good morning to you. Sorry, we just need to be more careful. Listen. What? Hello? Hey! Hey! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey! Hey! We're down here! In here! We're here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ssh. We in here. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Are you okay? Hey. Are you okay? Come here. Nowhere. Hey. Ssh, it's okay, okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay. Hello? Daddy. Daddy! Naomi? Daddy, it's Naomi. Oh my God, oh my God. We're stuck. Is your dad on the phone? We're in Norway. Norman? We're in, we're under some snow and I don't really know where we are, dad. Norman? Norman we're buried on the side of a road. Daddy, can you hear me? We are 50 miles east of our hotel. Can you hear me? Give me the phone. Dad. Give me the... Dad. It's dead. Why didn't you wake me up? This was our one chance, do you know that? It's getting colder in here. I know. We came all this way for my stupid book signing. No. Don't think like that. Keep your strength up. You have to eat too. I'm fine. What's gonna happen when the food runs out? I'm getting close on this window. If I can crack it just a few inches, we could scrape it. We'll eat the snow. And eat our way out? Matthew, we have to break a window, we have to start digging. Do you know what's out there? Do you know? Once it's broken, it's broken. Then what? Do you remember that story about that guy from Africa whose boat capsized? He survived for weeks in an air pocket. No food, nothing. He stayed put. You fucking baffle me. "It'll be fine, sweetheart, "we'll just pull right over here, "we'll drive to the hotel in the morning." We both agreed that it was not a good idea to drive aimlessly through the night. But it was a good idea to fall asleep during a blizzard! Did you know we were gonna wake up in the middle of the next fucking Ice Age? What is your problem? What are you doing? What? Breathe, what's wrong? What's happening? Is it the baby? Naomi? Naomi? Pills are in my bag. We're supposed to be partners. Just leave it. Were you ever gonna tell me? It's not your problem. We can't be up each other's asses all the time. That's being up each other's asses? Yes. People have secrets. What the fuck does that mean? Tell me. What secrets? Just... Drop it. Please. I think we should write a letter, for when we're discovered. No. I think we should consider the possibility. I don't wanna hear that. Is that what you've been so busy writing? It's not your business. It is my business. You don't get to make those decisions for both of us. What did you write? What did you write? I wrote a stupid story, okay? About? A woman in Paris. Paris. It's a bit more glamorous than a giant heap of snow in Norway. And? And she's a helpless old lady who lives alone and gets stuck in her bathroom. Okay? Go on. She starts banging on the walls and clanking on the pipes, and she even opens her window and starts yelling, and nothing. But the neighbors, they complain about the noise, and nothing happens. Until finally, when the landlord needs to collect his rent, it's when he breaks down her door and finds her. Is she alive? She was barely alive. Thank you. But he evicted her. It is funny, though, who gets stuck in a bathroom? Probably the same idiots who fall asleep during a blizzard. Hey! Help! Help! Hey, help! Hey! Help me! Hey! Help! Help! Matt, Matt, stop. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It's okay. No. Listen, you were right, you were right. Vehicles pass by here, someone else is gonna come. No one's coming, no one else will come. I can't catch a fucking break. What are you saying right now? I got fired. You said you had vacation time. No. No, what else can I say, I suck. I was ashamed, okay? Fucking shamed, is that what you need to hear? What did you want me to say? Hey, hey look I know the book isn't off to a great start and I lost my job, but great news, we're gonna have a baby. Don't turn this around on me. No. You're doing this because you lied. This isn't about me or the baby. No, no, no, you never wanted this baby, that's why you're still taking your pills. Don't you dare! Don't you fucking dare! Don't try to tell me how I feel about having my child! Then why? Why are you still taking your pills? I brought the pills in case of an emergency, what this fucking is! I'm trying to do things the right way, I'm trying to do it everything the right way, what the fuck! Except drugging our unborn child, that's okay, right? That doesn't cross, hey, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Is this what you want, huh? You want me to lash into you? Is it? Get the fuck off me. Get off me. What? Nothing. Naomi! What the hell is wrong with you? Naomi, stop! Leave me alone! We're gonna freeze in here, what the hell is wrong with you? Stay the fuck away from me! Oh, God dammit! What are you doing? Burning up. What are you doing? Stop! I know! What did you do to me? What did you do to me? Stop it. No, no, no, stop it, stop it. Stop it. Get off of me. Get off, get off of me! It's me, it's me. Get off! I'm right here. Let me out! Let me out! You can't get out, okay? I'm not trying to hurt you. Please, I don't want you to hurt yourself. What? What is it? What is it? Is it the baby? No? What is it? You need to talk to me. Is this the first time you felt this? Why didn't you tell me anything? I don't know , I don't know, I can't feel anything. Okay, okay. I think you're hypothermic, okay, we need to warm you up. We need to warm you up, okay? There you go, there you go. There you go. Okay, okay. Baby, here, here, here. There you go. There you go. Come on. Okay, come on, gotta put your energy up. Come on, eat, eat, come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's happening, it's happening again. I think this is it. No. No, no, I can't, I can't do this now. I can't. I don't think we have much of a choice, baby. I can't do it, I can't. Matt, it's coming. Okay. Naomi, you gotta push! Come on, one more push. One more push, come on, baby. Come on. Come on. What is it? I can't. Please. You gotta push, baby. Push, okay? Come on. Pancakes. Buttermilk pancakes. With salted butter. And maple syrup. And crispy bacon. Okay. Oh, like uh, applewood smoked bacon that you just scoop up some maple syrup. Waffles. Belgian waffles. So crispy and golden with ever so slightly runny eggs. Oh, I hate runny eggs. I love you so much. I love you. Babe? Hmm? We haven't named her yet. No, we haven't. What do you wanna name her? You make the call. How about Olivia? Like your sister? No. Like live. It's perfect. Hi, Liv. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You okay? Ssh, ssh. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. You're all right, come on this way. I have you. I got you, I got you. You're okay. You're okay, baby. Give her this. I'm working up some good heat. Don't worry about me. Ssh, ssh, it's okay. It's okay. Good morning. I'm so tired. Matt. Can I have some more water? Matt. Babe? Oh no. Babe. Hold on a second. Baby, wait a minute, it's okay, baby, it's okay. Hold on, it's okay, it's okay, baby, it's okay. It's okay, babe. Hey, wait, wait. Matt? Matt? Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is not. Three. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. Don't, it's just a letter. Help me, help me. Help me. Help me. Come on. Come on, baby, please, please. I know. I know. I know, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay. Come on, baby, you have to eat, please. Please. Oh, thank God. Okay. No, of course not. She's okay. She's warm now, thanks to you. What? It is tough. You were never really looking for your car. The cabbie was so pissed. I know. Let me see you. Liv, now. We're getting out, Liv, we're getting out. We're going home, Liv. It's okay. It's okay, Liv, it's okay. At least we're getting out. We're getting out, Liv. Babe, thank you. Goodbye, love. Stay with me. Come on, stay with me.
