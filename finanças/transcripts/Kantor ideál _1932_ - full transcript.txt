The Ideal Teacher To the white flowers a pink dream has come The whole shire breathes now with desire What's that arriving, why do you ask? Maytime and May says "Hooray". Springtime is here, come lasses fair Give your desire what it's longing When the world's ablaze like it's made from gold a heart will gladly go astray Homework: Spring is a symbol of youth and love. Pinkest spring is here once again, May coming one more time Who is not alone, then love will change his life to paradise That's too much, that's too much! And what exactly is too much? Isn't it terrible, Sir? From a seventeen year old? I don't think it's so terrible. There's some dexterity in it. Maybe experience too. All the grammar school boys are chasing her. Which girl is it? - The thin blonde from 7th grade who can't cross the street without a bunch of boys around her. Oh my, don't be so harsh. Weren't we all young? Sir, I still am. - Yes, yes. What's her name anyway? - Vera Matysova. But colleague, she's such a nimble girl. Who thinks she's Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich. I don't have high hopes of renting the room downstairs. Don't worry, aunt. I'll find you a tenant, right? And come straight home from school. - Yes, yes. So many boys are chasing your Vera, it's terrible. I hope it won't end badly. - Why? That girl has this sex-appeal. - What is sex-appeal? What is it? That no one will marry her. Because all the world is mad about her. Jesus, missy, what's up? I almost hit the world. A belly would be worse. Listen... do you know you'll be getting a new teacher? Really? - Yes, a young man and they say he's handsome. Is he ele...? - Rea, really. Elegant? - Well, elegant, which young man is not today? You could do me a favour then. Yes, missy, for you at least ten favours. What do you have in mind? When the professor comes, he has to move into our place, right? My aunt has a spare room, you know? - Well, I'll arrange it for you. I'll arrange it when the professor arrives at our train station. The porter will lead him straight to your place, your aunt's I mean. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. I'm decisively against giving the next year scholarship to Vera Matysova again. - But her marks are excellent. But not her behaviour! She's maddened the complete 7th grade. It was about time they got a new school master. According to the janitor he's quite young. I hope he has brown hair and blue eyes. That's my ideal. My ideal is Gary Cooper, nothing under the nose, nothing on the chin. Tanned, a medal from the foreign legion. - C'mon, you have too high expectations. You're a materialist. We are idealists. An ideal man is not defined. It's the man who rouses respect, that's the right ideal. We want the right teacher! - Yes, yes! Silence! Silence! Girls, the new teacher is mine. High forehead, you bet, eyes deeply set pants down to ankles as wide as can get Just like Apollo, strongest by far, brave like Nekolny or Gracciola. Yes, my ideal on Monday he adores me Tuesday, more of the same We see a film on Wednesday, very nice, Thursday we spend in the park Friday we meet again, go out on Saturday My ideal adores me on Sunday, the whole day the whole darn week Smart suited you'll see, a fine tie indeed Shoulders like Carnera and no padding for he Plays the piano keys, whiskered nattily He's such a real gentleman that I just want to cheer Yes, my ideal on Monday he adores me Tuesday, more of the same We see a film on Wednesday, very nice, Thursday we spend in the park Friday we meet again go out on Saturday My ideal adores me on Sunday, the whole day the whole darn week That's how I imagine our new teacher looks like. Long live the ideal teacher! - Wait, girls! That couldn't be. All the grammar school boys chase her and now she's after our new class master. He has to belong to us all! - Yes, yes! To us all. I'll go to meet him at the train station. No you won't! Girls, we'll choose which one of us will go welcome him. He's already on his way for sure. Sir, haven't you finished yet? No! I've only just begun, don't disturb me. Sit down! But it's already lunch time, Sir. I'm hungry for knowledge, not food. I've only just recently finished a big breakfast. We're closing. You've been here since eight and now it's twelve. Twelve o'clock already? But then I must have missed my train which leaves at 10:40. Well, you've probably missed that one. The train won't wait. Of course, steam engines don't wait. The only possibility for me is to find out in the time table the time of the next one. Tickets, please. Do you have a ticket? Thank you for your question, I have. - But I have to see it. Oh. Of course, sorry. Where... where... where? Sorry, there has to be a method in the search. How long I've been looking for this. So you don't have one? It's somehow disappeared. Here, write a new one. Sit down. Where to? - To the target, better say, to the destination. Where are you going to? I've made a knot in my handkerchief, so I wouldn't forgot to get off. And where do you get off? - In... in... in... You have to know where you're going to. - Yes, please, I know that, but I forgot the name. Ehm..., what can it... Wait, I'll say the stations in order. Please. - Lipov, Cernovice, Paganov... Oh yes, Paganov, that's right. That's my destination... If he didn't come at noon, he must come now by the express. Paganov. Excuse me kindly, what is the name of this station? Paganov. These are mine. Here are yours. Students of the seventh class of lyceum welcome you most warmly, Sir. How kind after my long-term residence abroad. I'm not a professor but I will keep the bouquet anyway. Oh my. Where is Professor Suchy then? Are you Professor Suchy? - Yes, I am Professor Suchy. I am supposed to take you to your apartment, please. - Let's go. So that you won't be angry I'll leave this teacher to you. Thank you very much. We'll prepare him a nice reception in class. Now I'd like to know who got our bouquet. Prof. Karel Suchy has been appointed to the local lyceum after Prof. Novak's sudden departure on sick leave. He will take up his pedagogical position. Here, take it. - Thank you kindly. I'll be off then. I'll stay in this silent room that is supposed to be my new home. Of course I rent this cosy room fully aware that you don't have any daughters. I'm a widow, Sir. Our marriage was unfortunately childless. You say unfortunately, I say thank God, otherwise I wouldn't be here, if your daughter was present. Oh, and who is this? - That's my niece, Sir. An orphan. Aunty, where is your coffee? As usual, in the kitchen. This niece, as you say, is living in this house? Yes, Sir. - Then excuse me, I'm leaving, for my explicit wish was no girls. - Sir, she's very virtous. You won't even know she's here. Well, hm, alright. I'll stay then. But under the condition that the girl will never set foot in my room. I need absolute calm to study. Because in a short time I will be, God willing, qualified as a doctor. So you will also be a doctor? Yes I will also be a doctor. - Forgive me my boldness, but, Sir doctor, I don't know what is it, but I always in the evening get such a pain in my back. Dear madam, I won't be a qualified doctor of medicine, but a doctor of philosophy. - Ah then, you'll be able to philosophize here calmly enough. May I serve you coffee? The coffee is delicious. The cake also. But... will the girl always bring the coffee? - Oh no, unless you call her yourself. I hope the Professor will be satisfied at our place. What shall I do with the bird? What airplane are you talking about? - I'm a good cook, I'm not boasting. On Saturday I would do haslet for lunch. And in the evening chicken breasts. And on Sunday a goose, dumplings and cabbage, Sir. But I don't own any geese or other poultry. And what is this? Where did this terrible bird come from? - You brought it here yourself. Me? Now I understand. What a twist of fate. What a terrible exchange for my valuable books. A goose! - Goose is delicious, Sir. Don't you like liver? - I like liver. You like liver! I like liver. Janitor, bring some oil and lubricate the door. It's squeaking. Yes, Sir. - Don't you dare touch the clock! Because when you set it then it is late. Just like you. You know, Sir, at our place at Hana nobody never missed anything. Just go. Hey, janitor! Where do I find the old man here? Or what do you call the director. The old man, of course we call him that. But you have to go to his office. He will be there in a moment. - And listen, is he a good-natured man? Totally, you'll soon find out yourself. There's the director's office. Thank you. - You're welcome. How may I help you? - My name is Suchy, Sir. Jesus, you're the new professor. Nice to meet you. You know, I'm the janitor here. What are you saying? Janitor? - Janitor, yes, yes. And who was the person lurking under the clock on a stool? That was me. Really, the similarity is significant. Well, anyone can make a mistake, all that matters is you're here. You see, the 7th grade needs a school master. Please. Well, I imagined you to be older, dear colleague. By your appearance. You know, an older man is more respected by the young. Maybe I could try to grow a beard, Sir. That won't be necessary. Please... sit down. I'd like to introduce you this evening to some of our colleagues, if that's alright with you. Absolutely, Sir. - Come after dinner then to Brandejs'. Every Friday we go bowling there. Have you ever bowled, colleague? Unfortunately, Sir, I've never bowled. Never bowled? - Never bowled. Well, never bowled. Gentlemen, we have to catch on to win. Well, we have to. It's my turn now. Professor Suchy then. Please. - I'm curious. Me too. No understatements, gentlemen. C'mon. Nicely. Don't forget our fate is in your hands. Seven or six at least, so that we can tie. Please, go on. We can see, dear colleague, you've never bowled. Well, I haven't, Sir. Please, colleague, you have two bowls left. Energically please, so that it would make six at least. Gather your strength a little. What a pity. Six, but beers. Please, colleague, you have one final bowl. Stand up. There's no shame in not knowing, but boldly. Take your time, colleague. Great, that was great. We won. Colleague, you have bowled before. Sir, I haven't. You'll be a class master from tomorrow in 7th grade? That's a nice class. But you know girls. Very restless. I've only taught boys so far. So I don't have any experience with girls. You'll cope but you have to be energetic. Yes, I will be very energetic. There'll be silence here! Enough! One has to be energetic around you. Fortunately I have enough energy. I will tame you. What was that? What was it at that desk? Remember... The only person to sit at their desk is one who values it. And those who don't, get out! What are you playing with? You! You, don't look at your neighbour. I mean you, miss. Yes, yes, yes. I'll show you! Stand up! Sit down! Stand up! Sit down! Come in! We don't know each other, colleague. I'm, I'm professor Suchy. Doctor Plasilova, nice to meet you. Do you like it here? You should see your students before the class starts. I've already done so. And I saw the classroom until there were no students. Here is the seating plan. The new teacher is such a good-natured man that we can do anything. Is everything ready? - Everything's ready. No telling, fatty! I will tell. Sure I'll tell. If you tell, we'll hang you by your pigtails from the chandelier. Jesus. Welcome I'm Professor Suchy. - Nice to meet you. I'll learn your names first. Here at the second desk on the left is Ludmila Stastna. Of course at the last desk on the right sits Marie Kalinova. But it's certain that at the first desk in the middle sits Vera Matysova. Sit down. What is it there? Silence! Or I'll make a noise here. What is it? What's up with the board? What do you want, student? Speak, please. - Professor, please, they, girls... Them. - So them girls. - Them, girls. Them, girls, girls wanted, wanted..., wanted..., wanted... Put your braids down! - Please... No please, what please. put your braids down now! But Professor, it's not my fault. Silence! Why are you laughing, this is a classroom. Laugh on rag day. Notice On 20 May to be held in the gym: STUDENT RAG DAY A rich programme and besides the play The Greeks at Troy or Menelaus and Helen A dance after the show!! Come here. Come. C'mon, come here. Come here, Mr. Jecminek. What's going on, Sir? - Come. - What's up? So, here's your partner for now. And you have to help us, you know? - I'll gladly help you, Sir. We need a Menelaus. So you're a Menelaus. No, since my birth I'm Jecminek. But wait, for now, you're Menelaus, understood? Who is he? - That's none of your concern. Look, here's your job. You will read the red parts. Understood? Yes, yes, immediately. - Immediately, wait. Here's your sword. You'll chase Helen with it. Wouldn't a gun be better? What do you think? - Pff, a sword. So, my speech is right. - Wait, we'll find it here. And we'll begin pretty sharply. - Oh, woman, most unhappy, I'm crazy with crazing after you. Not crazing, craving. - I'm crazy with craving after you. Alright then. It seems the janitor didn't ring the bell to end the class. Consider the bell rung. He's a patsy. He's afraid of women like they were fire. I bet with you that he hasn't kissed a single one. I bet with you I'll be the first one he'll kiss. If you want, you forgot the husband of your heart, I'll pierce you with this sword to silence your heart. To silence... Forgive me, Sir, I went a little bit wild. That's it! He doesn't have beard. Sir, I may not have a beard, but I've bought a substance that will help me, God willing, I'll grow a beard in no time. On the contrary, dear colleague, I need you beardless. You'll play Menelaus. - Let them clap, Sir. There's only Mene, Me, Manless, or so, and I forgot to ring for break. Go, go, go! I've written a play for the spring rag day. And you're playing Menelaus. Sir, I have never played any theatre so far. That doesn't matter. Under the lead of colleague Plasilova, you'll become a perfect lover. Me a lover? But... a lover has to look... completely different. Here's Chevalier with a signature. Mary, a photography of Chevalier with a signature. Half of a flask of cologne. Sit down! What trash is this here? - Please! Please! What has happened here, student, whose name I haven't yet remembered. Please, Matysova has made a bet with the other girls. Hm, made a bet, hm. What was the reason for this bet? I can't say. - You have to! But I'm ashamed. I call on you, student, to immediately tell me what this bet is about. Vera bet she will get a kiss. Oh, I see. A kiss. And from whom will she get this kiss? From you. Stand up, you disturbing student. I don't want to scold you in front of your schoolmates. I will deal with you afterwards. Tell me, romantic girl, why have you made such a foolish bet? Because I like you. I... I... I... Leave. And don't ever repeat that. So what? What happened? - I told him I liked him. Hey, janitor! - What would you like. Advise me of an establishment where I can buy a sports suit. Coffee! Miss Vera, coffee! Come in. Miss Vera, can I ask you for my usual cup of coffee? Yes, right, it's coming. Miss Vera, I forgot to tell you that the foolish bet, which you've made, you won't win. Also, Miss Vera, who was the giver of these roses? I ask you only as your teacher. - Roses? They were sent by a rich gentleman, who lives in a castle and is seriously interested in me. This is for me, colleague? That's wonderful. As an apology, for being late. I lo... love you. Infinitely, infinitely I love you. I love you, I love you infi... hm. We are rehearsing here for tomo... tomorrow's show. I know, you play Menelaus. - Miss here plays Helen. I'm a little bit superstitious, and when I remember that tomorrow is Friday the 13th, I'm really afraid for the show. Oh, I, foolish woman forgot my faithful, lost my two hearts in the sea. In the sea of memories I was drowning. In the sea of memories I was drowning, dear. In the sea of memories I was drowning, dear. Dear Helen, oh, Helen, oh. I vove... lo... love, Helen laugh... Colleague, please, I'd like to remind you of the scene with Helen. The love scene, where you hug her and kiss her. You really struggled with it, colleague. I'll try my best, Sir. Come on, colleague, we're going to start. Helen, Helen! I laugh, love you in the sea of memories. Dear. What did the seamstress do with it? The dress should have been here an hour ago. She's very unlucky with the costume. Imagine, she sewed one side totally skewed. Shorter in front and longer at the back. The seamstress said: It's obviously because today is Friday the 13th. It's given me a headache. Well, she's a little bit superstitious. She pricked her finger three times. And she added a weird story to it. What story? Nothing, just some nonsense. - So, tell me this nonsense. She said that when a seamstress pricks her finger three times a real disaster will happen to the one wearing that dress. But I've never heard that. - Yes, yes. But they will be nice on you. - Do you think so? Goodness! A broken mirror, what bad luck... that's completely... That's a lot of bad luck. Friday the 13th, thrice pricked finger, the mirror... I'll go crazy, I have a fever, my head hurts! Get me some pills! I'll be late dressing, c'mon, the pills, mirror. It's all too much. Sleeping pills Girls, which one of you wants to take the headache pills to Miss Plasilova. Me! Me! Me! - Give it to me. Here you are! - Give it to me, she likes me. Oh, God. Come in. God. What's up? - Miss, excuse me, but I heard you have a headache. - A big one. Here are some excellent pills, that will help you. Good, how many should I take? - Two are enough. I'll take three to be sure. One, two, three. Oh, God! Everything alright, Mr. Jecminek? - Everything alright, Sir. Please, be careful about everything. Miss, what's wrong with you? We're about to begin. Miss! What's happened, Sir? - I don't know but you'll go on stage. She won't get up, I guess. What about wetting her neck? - I think it'll be quite useless. Jesus, they are starting to play and I haven't even given them the sign. What's up? They're starting up, where's my Helen? - What's happening, Sir? - I can't wake her up! Don't worry, Sir. I'll sing something in the meantime. But man, what will you sing? - Don't worry, Sir, I'll make something up. Don't worry, just go. What's up? Has she woken yet? - She won't wake up for some time. Jesus, that'll be a scandal. What shall I do? Miss! Sir, I could play it. But Matysova, you don't know the role. I read it yesterday at Professor Suchy's place. And if you prompt me I'll get it all. I'm used to it from school. Matysova, I myself will prompt you. Take her dress please. Girls are like roses, blooming in spring Frisky as baby lambs aleaping Oh how I suffer, the youth of today I really must have my say No rest can I seek, 'cos I slave all week The janitor keeps on working In the cellar deep keeps the furnace lit Then he's sweeping everywhere Carries books, rings the bell for breaks and then what's his reward? He sells sausage, gets paid no-sage, because it's on credit. Look, he's coming. Look, he's coming! Look, he's coming. Look, he's coming! Colleague, your glasses. glasses. Glasses! Sit down. Sit down! Thank you, Sir. I'll stand. Sit down with Helen. You're supposed to be Helen? - It's Helen! Only death can part us. Only... only death can part us. Only war can take me away. Sword. Draw your sword. It's getting late. I have to go. It's getting late. - It's getting la... late. I have to leave. - I have to leave. It's getting late. - It's getting late. I love you. I... I laugh. I love you. La... la... Where to, where to? - To play in the theatre. Jesus, what theatre. The theatre is long over. They've just started dancing. How was it? - How did it taste? Girls, he's a little bit wooden, but it was quite nice. It was very good, Professor. You were a natty dresser. Wait, I'll fix that. Mr. Jecminek. - Well. Have you ever fallen in love? - That's a long time ago. But I have to tell you, it sucked. Women are beasts. Do you think all women are beasts? Well yes. - What about... Matysova? You know, she's... - She's a little imp. She's crazy, teasing His Lordship from the castle. - Matysova? Yes, exactly, she's telling him the story. If I knew you'd be acting, I'd have sent you a large bouquet. Thank you, pretend it happened. - What hasn't happened can be realized. Come tomorrow to my castle and I'll drown you in roses. You can bring me the roses but I won't visit your castle. Why not? For what reason? - Just because. That's not a reason. - A woman doesn't need any reason. Why don't you want to come to my castle anyway? I can't go alone to a young man. But Miss... Professor Suchy. - Junek. Pardon. - Please. Sir, let me invite you. Pardon, what's the deal? We have to go home. I promised your aunt I would accompany you. Thank you, but I'm taking a car. C, c, car? This one? - Of this elegant, young man. Colleague, we've just arranged a great school trip. And this note will open to you the castle Bella Vista. Springtime is here, come lasses fair Give your desire what it's longing When the world's ablaze like it's made from gold a heart will gladly go astray Pinkest spring is here again, And May comes one more time Who is not alone, then love will change his life to paradise To the white flowers a pink dream has come The whole shire breathes now with desire What's that arriving, why do you ask? Maytime and May says "Hooray". You said that professor Suchy is mad about you. Look at him. It seems he prefers old books to young girls. Do you want me to persuade you that he's in love with me? I'd like to see that. - That can be arranged. Please. Miss Vera... - What did you just say? I said Miss Vera. - Wine. Sit down. That's a good wine, right? - Ah. It's a wonderful wine. It perks one up. And one could say things. What things? Things that a professor shouldn't say. What a pity. Then I won't hear what a professor shouldn't say. Wine! Have you never noticed... that you're sympathetic to me? That I like you? That... But when I look at you, Miss Vera, I lose the courage to tell you what I'd like to say to you. You know what? I'll hide and I will listen to you. Good, Miss Vera, but it will be hard. Very hard. - I'm waiting. Vera, Veruska... I... I love you. I love you so much. Vera... Can you hear me, Veruska? Girls, get ready, we're going home. Why so soon, Sir? I wanted to show you so many other things. Thank you, but I've seen enough. You'll have to forgive me. We have a very important conference at school. Gentlemen, after the holidays, we must to examine diligently. But keep in mind that the future of each student depends on your correct classification. Come in. Hello. - Hello. You know me, Sir. I'm the aunt of Vera Matysova. And I'm bringing the proof of poverty. - Ah, because of the scholarship? Yes. It came today, so I'm in a hurry not to be late. Good, good. But it's not certain that she'll get the scholarship this year. That can't be right, she gets it every year... Well, it's not definitive yet. We are just waiting for the decision of the school master. He can reverse it to her advantage. Sir, I'm poor. And if the girl doesn't get the support she won't finish her studies. Well, I hope Professor Suchy will vote for your daughter. For sure. Please. Sir, he says it depends on you whether Vera gets the scholarship this year. You'll put a good word for her, right? She'll make it up to you, you'll see. You can count on me, I'll do everything that's in my power. Thank you, Sir, you're very good. Here's the request. It was last year in 1st grade. - But in the second half. You're right, Sir. - At the end of the second half. It was then, as I remember... - In the spring. Sorry, Sir, it's about Vera Matysova. I'd like to help her to get the scholarship. If you'd like to help her, so be it. Gentlemen, I think it is decided. And also, Sir, I'd like to go to Prague on holiday, and I ask you for some leave. And what will you do there, colleague? Qualify as a doctor. Long may he live, long may he live. Long may he live, our doctor. A freshman doctor. Hello boys! - Ah, Domin. Domin. Now our old grammar school gang is together. Congrats, Karlicek. Cheers. - Cheers. - But Karlicek, have you taken the pledge? - I beg your pardon, I'm not used to it. Well, you must indulge yourself today. Gentlemen, I indulged myself once in my life and I'm sorry for it to this very day. Who knows what you were drinking. Some slops, no doubt? - Oh, sorry, slops. It was the best wine of the highly valued cellar of the Paganovsky castle. 1911. - Paganov? Paganovsky castle? And you were drinking there wine, year 1911? - Yes. Yes. - And when? Well, about a week ago. We were invited there with our school. And who invited you? - Well, the owner. The owner? Can you tell me his name? Junek. - Rudolf Junek. The castle is mine. I bought it with the whole area. This is an accountant who is supposed to check the books. - But... He's impersonating the owner. - Yes! - What a bastard! I'll fire him. - That would be adequate! We'll talk about it another time. But you haven't told us what happened to you. Karlicek. Listen, Would you be unhappily in love? Don't you have a secret love? Let him be, boys. He'll tell us later anyway. Waiter, a bottle of champagne. I've always read, everyone said, that love is a precious jewel This added fire to my desire to follow this golden rule The time's not past to find a lass I'll search for her both near and far a girl so sweet she'll run off with my heart Forgive me, please I've lost all my will carved your name in my heart and think of you still And now I can see what I should have known by trying to love you my future's been blown There's not a thing to gain from loving you now The devil's got a hold of me now and fills me with desire Forgive me, please I've lost all my will carved your name in my heart and think of you still Pals, that's my end. - What end are you talking about? We'll help you. Pals, we've always helped each other. Karlicek, we won't leave you like this. The biggest mistake is how you look. These terrible clothes of yours. But that's the least. Why else does my brother have a male fashion company? I have a cosmetic and fitness company. - And I have a dance school. I don't have any company, but I do know a lot about women. If we put it all together we'll make a completely new man of you. No, no. - If you come with me, you'll see London, Paris, Riviera, whatever you want. - No, I can't. Why? - I have to stay with my aunt who's working hard just so I can finish my studies. And when I finish them she'll need me. But such a small problem can be solved. See you. - See you. You're still here? - And where should I be? At the train station. I told you the professor was arriving. He might not be pleased to see me. Because I... No 'because'. You must show your gratitude for him helping you to the scholarship. That's why I wouldn't like to... I've already told you, go to the train station. Has the professor arrived yet? - No, he hasn't. But here's a package from the castle. Someone will get your aunt out of the way, so I'll expect you at the station, 10:00 tomorrow morning. Don't say a word to anyone. Kisses, yours Junek. That's a nice sum, isn't it? Put it back in the box, quickly. I beg your pardon! I don't beg anything. Just do it. Miss Matysova is here. - Invite her in. I won't disturb you. You think so highly of yourself that you dare to wait for me at the train station. Haven't I said clearly to you that I don't want anything to do with you? Then why behave to me in such way? Because I didn't know then I was in love with someone else. Am I allowed to know the chosen one? - Professor Suchy is the one I love. You're quick to change your loved ones. - I haven't loved anyone before! Remember that. Goodbye! So you even wanted to kidnap the girl to the Riviera? That's none of your business. Sir, you are immediately relieved of your duties as accountant at Paganov castle for misconduct in your work and fraud in the local society. And now clear out this instant! Girls, fatty says that our class master will return today. We'll call him doctor. It'll surely embarass him. But girls, no laughing. - That's easier said than done. But as soon as he appears in his weird coat, it'll be over. How shall we prank him? Not at all. That'll confuse him most. He'll be expecting something. I see you like to eavesdrop. You'll stand there for the whole hour. Can you tell me why have you come late? I'll give you a recipe how to be early. Stop with the powdering, making up your face and realize that you're not on a date but at school. And now we'll test you. Matysova to the board. Tell me, when was the first division of Poland? The first division of Poland was... ...happened... in the year... in the year one thousand six hundred... It happened and you also happened. What do you know about Willem Tell? Willem Tell...
