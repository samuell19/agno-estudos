You don't wanna eat the cockroach? -I think you wanna eat the cockroach. -No! Help! Why did you take all these photos if you didn't wanna eat it? -MATTEO: Betta. -You okay? Well, look at this. The freak made a couple new friends. Why don't you stay at our place tonight? Betta. You don't remember me, do you? I'm Andrea. I'm your brother. That's the curse of the Stria. She is an evil witch who lives in the Nowhere. She kidnaps children and lures them back there with false promises. You have to believe me. You have to help me escape from the Nowhere. We can use that door to get there. But you'll need the keys to open it. -RICCARDO: Are you telling us a riddle? -SISTER 1: If you are truly knights, this shall prove it. -BETTA: What's this thing for? -The game will tell us everything. -Hey! I'll be right back. -She'll be right back. (ECHOING) Just remember. nothing is more important -than finding the keys. -I won't let you down... Mother. RICCARDO: It's like a video game. Every time we finish a level, the game lets us progress. Would you like to come over later? We can show you how it works. You're the one whose fault it is. You're just two stupid city kids from out of town. -Hey! We have to stay united. -I'll save my brother by myself. -(CREAKS) -RICCARDO: "I'm a monster, "and all I devour, every bird, fish, fauna and flower." Who even cares! We're finished. Because the Knights of Castelcorvo are over. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES) Pass me that pencil. No. -(PENCIL THUDS) -(GIULIA SIGHS) -(DOOR OPENS) -ZIA: I'm home. You guys are really still studying? It's Saturday. Why don't you go outside instead? I have a surprise for you. (CHUCKLES) Ta-da. MARGHERITA'S B&B CASTELCORVO Get a load of this. Tell me, what do you think? Isn't it a great idea? -You'll be helping to advertise the B&B. -How are we helping to advertise? -Exactly what do you mean? -Well, it means I got these for you. -Ah. (CHUCKLES) -Wait. -You want us to wear those? -Exactly. They're great, aren't they? And they're customized for you. See, this one is for Ricky and this one is for Giulia. (CHUCKLES) They're cute, right? RICCARDO: Auntie... Oh, that's okay. I guess if you... don't like them, you don't have to wear them. Although, if you do this favor for me, I can do one for you. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Nothing's gonna change my mind, Auntie. Sorry. I could make a call and install the Wi-Fi. Then we can wear them. Actually, we think they're really cool. Don't we, Giulia? Yeah. Very cool. Thank you. You're such great kids. (KISSES, CHUCKLES) We're getting Wi-Fi. (CHUCKLES) -Those are some pretty ugly shirts. -So, we'll go around the corner -and then just take them off. -You always do that. So, then what about our promise? Do you really wanna walk around wearing that? We'll wear the shirts for today. It's the least we can do, just to make her happy. One day. (BOTH SIGH) Just so we're both clear, I'm only wearing this today. -And only to get Wi-Fi. -Well, I just think we shouldn't be so rude to our aunt when she's been nice to us. You really don't care about offending people, do you? Or accusing them unfairly without ever apologizing. What was unfair? I'm right to not trust Zeno. I don't need to apologize to you -or to anyone. -Those two are our friends. And because of you, they don't even wanna see us. My fault, sure. It's always my fault. While you get to be everyone's hero. You're just perfect. Don't follow me. I wanna be alone. (RAVEN CAWS) (STRIA WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) Things are looking up for us, Mother. Soon you'll be free. You've been taking risks. (INHALES) Transforming into a raven to leave the Nowhere was dangerous. But I think it was worth it. Careful with that type of magic. You risked being stuck forever in the form of a raven. It took time to regain this form, but I was sure that I could do it. Even if I can't replicate the spell, I won't need to. The keys will let me into the Nowhere. The children have found the first key already. It appears that they really are the chosen ones. Yes. They may prove useful to us. They're following some kind of trail. Eventually, they are going to lead us straight to the Evening Key. How clever of you, my child. Soon, we'll take the keys back again -and my exile will be finished. -ZENO: Yes, it will. I know just what to do. (RAVEN CAWING) (DOG BARKING) (BELL TOLLING) (DOG BARKING) (PAINT BRUSH SQUISHES) (BELL DINGS) (BETTA SIGHS) (BELL DINGS) -What do you want? -GIULIA: Are you busy? Can't you see? Can I borrow some grease from you? My chain's been grinding. Sure. You only came here to borrow some grease. -No. -Your brother's been extremely rude to us. To both me and Matteo. He should be here, apologizing to both of us, but he isn't. I won't change my mind. I'm doing this alone. That's exactly why I'm here. Has the game changed again? Look. Do you know this place? Yes. It's the square with the old bell tower. What should I look for there? "I'm a monster and all I devour, every bird, fish, fauna and flower. "I chew through iron and steel like rust. I turn the hardest stone to dust. "Many have tried to stop me but none were prepared. "But I'm telling you there's no need to despair. "My hands were started by those who would say, "that my only eye sees only twice in a day." -(SIGHS) -(SIGHS) Thanks. -What's up with that T-shirt? -It's just an ad. (BETTA CHUCKLES) Margarita's B&B in Castelcorvo. -(LAUGHS) -(CHUCKLES) You know, they'll be laughing at you all over Castelcorvo. -(LAUGHS) -It's okay. -Are you going there right now? -Yeah. There's no time to waste. -Do you want me to come along? -(CHUCKLES) If you want. (CHUCKLES) What about your bike? No, there's not enough time to fix it. Walking there will be faster. (KEY TAPPING) RICCARDO, MATTEO THE OLD TOWER BELL IS OUR SLOT SEE YOU THERE. THE KNIGHTS OF CASTELCORVO CAN'T GIVE UP! GIULIA: Betta, wait up. They're ugly but it was worth it. -Did you get the Wi-Fi? -Yeah. You got here fast. (SCOFFS) I wasn't doing anything else. Where can I even go while I'm wearing this? Besides, you didn't tell me that she would be here. You didn't tell me he'd be here either. -You must really love playing the boss. -That's not what I want. I just want us to make up. -What's up guys? Hey. -Hi. -So, did we get a new riddle? -Yes. But I'm solving it alone. I'm not doing anything with you guys until Riccardo apologizes. (SCOFFS) Until I apologize, huh? Sure. Once I'm back in the city, I'll write you an email with my apology. Or a telegram. -Betta can get a telegram. -(MATTEO LAUGHING) Matteo. You know this isn't very funny. That just made me think about a funny joke. Do you guys know the one about the dog that wanted to send a telegram? No and I don't wanna hear it. All right. This dog wants to send a telegram and he's dictating at the office. -Woof, woof, woof, woof. -(BRICKS CLATTERING) Woof, woof, woof, woof. (CHUCKLES) The clerk says, "If you want to add one extra woof, "you'll get the same price." So, then the dog, he says, uh... uh, then the dog says... he says... uh... I forgot the rest. All right, let's get to work guys. The game led us here. What now? (AIRPLANE ENGINE RUMBLING) See anything in particular? -No, nothing. -Well, nothing except the old clock. It's been broken for years and always marks the same time. So, I don't know how useful it's gonna be. What a weird coincidence! That's exactly what time it is right now. Look. MATTEO: Let me see. -Hey, losers! -(GASPS) Castelcorvo is too small for you to hide from me, -especially with those shirts. -(LAUGHS) -Yeah. But... we can run away. -Let's split up. MATTEO: Run, run, run. Do you think they'll make me eat another Coleoptera? -(BREATHES HEAVILY) -Matteo, hey, come on. I have to photograph this gorgeous lucanus maculifemoratus. -GIULIA: Hurry up! -Just a sec. Put your phone away and run. Hurry, before they catch up. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. -GIULIA: Come on. -I'm coming. (BOTH PANT) -Do you think we lost him? -Shh. We lost him. We have to meet back up with Giulia and Matteo before it's too late or it'll be two against three. It's not like the four of us can do any better. (PANTING) -Giulia won't pick up. -Maybe, she's too busy running away. -That's weird, it's still 10:20. -Come with me. -(ALL PANT) -RICCARDO: Hey! What is going on? Why are we back here? We ran in opposite directions. I'm positive. Well, at least they didn't steal your bike this time. -It's not possible. -(LAUGHS) -Why are you laughing? -That just made me think about a funny joke. Do you guys know the one about the dog -that wanted to send a telegram? -No and I don't wanna hear it. (BRICKS CLATTERING) Well, then. All right. This dog wants to send a telegram -and he's dictating at... -I'm having déjà vu. You what? It's when you feel like you're reliving a moment for the second time. MATTEO: Mm... no. So, anyway, he's dictating at the office. Woof, woof, woof, woof. Woof. Woof. Woof, woof. (LAUGHS) So, then the clerk says to the dog, "You can add one extra woof to get the same price." -And so, the dog says... -Says what? I forgot the rest. All right, let's get to work guys. The game led us here. What now? You guys, we've said those things already. Here, just look at my phone. It says 10:20. Do you know what that means? -It means you have a broken phone? -Everyone check their phones. -Betta, check your watch. -That's impossible. MATTEO: Hey, let me see. -Hey, losers! -(GASPS) Castelcorvo is too small for you to hide from me, -especially with those shirts. -(LAUGHS) -Yeah. But... we could still run away. -Let's split up. MATTEO: Run, run, run. (PANTING) -The Coleoptera from earlier. -Matteo. Hey, come on! Uh, it's the same one. I still have the picture I took. Put your phone away and run. -Let's get going. -I'm saying, we've been this way before. Hurry before they catch up. Come on. (BOTH PANT) -Do you think we've lost them? -Shh. We lost them. We have to meet back up with Giulia and Matteo before it's too late or it'll be two against three. It's not like the four of us can do any better. (BOTH BREATHE HEAVILY) But we've already said all of this. Now I try to call Giulia -and you will say... -Maybe she's too busy running away. -Betta... -Come with me. -(MATTEO PANTS) -But... It's impossible, you see? We're here again. Well, at least they didn't steal your bike -this time. -Matteo, you said that already. -Oh, yeah. -Now, you'll start telling the stupid joke you don't remember. I remember. I remember doing something. I was taking a picture. Look at this. This is it. I took it at 10:20, down on that path. And right now, it's still 10:20. Not just on my phone, but also on the big clock and all of your watches. That's exactly what's happening here. We're stuck in a time loop. You're crazy. That only happens in movies. (SIGHS) Look at that guy there. Do you see him? -Yeah, he's a guy. So? -Yes. -He's gonna drop everything. -(BRICKS CLATTERING) How'd you know that? It's like I've been telling you, we're stuck inside a game. When you're playing a video game, if you get stuck on a level, you have to do it -over and over and over. -So, is there a way to break the loop? We finish the level. Solve the riddle in our case. So, then until the riddle is finally solved, we'll keep coming back to the square. Hey, losers! Castelcorvo is too small for you to hide from me. Let's split up. -(BRICKS CLATTERING) -Hey, losers! -Hey, losers! -Let's split up. -(BRICKS CLATTERING) -Hey, losers! -Hey, losers! -BETTA: Let's split up. Hey, losers! -We can run away again. -BETTA: Let's split up. We should focus on solving the riddle. -Right. -Yeah. "I'm a monster and all I devour, every bird, fish, fauna and flower. "I chew through iron and steel like rust. I turn the hardest stone to dust." Of course. It's time. The answer to the first part of the riddle must be time. Yes. You're brilliant, Betta. So, then... that means we're free now? -(BRICKS CLATTERING) -(SIGHS) Oh, no. Why don't you be more careful next time, huh? There's still a second part. "Many have tried to stop me but none were prepared. "So, I'm telling you now, no need to despair. "My hands were started by those who would say "that my only eye sees only twice in a day." You guys! Look up at the clock tower. Of course. Have you ever heard how a broken clock is right at least twice a day? So, all we have to do is reset the clock's hands -and then time will get moving. -Luckily, I know how to do that. Uh, my dad collects old clocks and often, I like to help out. Now I also know why we needed the gear wheel that -we found down in the cellar. -GIULIA: This one? Yeah. Um, to be precise, it's a mainspring. -It's what powers the clock's mechanism. -So let's go, guys. -We should get in there. -Yeah. No time to lose. Good thing we took that shortcut. (SIGHS) Here we are. (SIGHS) Look, there's a missing piece here. (GEAR SQUEAKS) -Now what? -MATTEO: Now we have to charge it like you would an alarm clock. -(SIGHS) -It won't start. It could be rusty. (GRUNTS) Come on. Help me out here. (ALL PANT, GRUNT) (GEARS TURN) -(GRUNTS) -(CREAKS) -It's working now. -(LAUGHS) -(THUDDING) -Well done, Matteo. -RICCARDO: Come on, let's check outside. -Yeah, let's go. (PANTING) Come on. (ALL CHEER) -MATTEO: We did it! -BETTA: Yay! Yes! -GIULIA: Let's go. -Hurry. Wait a sec, I never actually finished telling you that joke. Okay, so, this dog wants to send a telegram... We have Wi-Fi. Auntie really did it. (CHUCKLES) There's a new card here. Look at this. It's... a QR code. (PHONE BEEPS) It's for an app that's called the Knights of Castelcorvo. -I'll install it too. -BETTA: Yeah. Do it fast. -RICCARDO: It's done. -BETTA: So, what is it? It's a digital version of the game. The card is virtual. "The numbers of the sphere are two, "closer to the Evening Key they will get you. "To start, look for the friend who follows by day and who leaves by night. "And then look for what passes through glass "but leaves no light. "Beware though, the words you need to find, "in the square, they are confined." -In the square? -MATTEO: Yes. It's some kind of puzzle. It seems like the solution, or rather, the solutions, can be spelled out with these letters. Good, right? That's easier, isn't it? (SIGHS) No. There's something else, too. -(TIMER BEEPING) -RICCARDO: It's a countdown. BETTA: So what? We have less than three hours to solve the riddle. -(SIGHS) No. -No. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES)
