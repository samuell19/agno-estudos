According to the experts, what each of wanted most was a house in the suburbs, two cars, our own barbecue pit, and exactly 3.2 children. Looking back, I wasn't much different than anyone else. I took it for granted that Mr. Right would show up some day and sweep me off my feet. That was before I met Jack and Neal. Boy, did I have it wrong. Jack kerouac was a struggling novelist. He wrote stories in his mother's kitchen about the jazzed-up lives of the artists and musicians he knew in New York. Neal cassady was the son of a Denver wino. He'd grown up on skid row, but had spent most of his youth in reform school for stealing cars. The day he got out of jail, the first thing he did was steal another car and head straight for New York. Hello, Jack! Jack and Neal were friends with a wild young poet named ira steiker. It was ira that introduced them in greenwich village. Ira, would you get out of there? Come on. Neal thought Jack was kind of square until he began to read his work. Jack wrote out words like they were notes to a saxophone solo. It was the same kind of music that went through Neal's mind. In no time, the two were friends. When Neal decided to drive to San Francisco, he asked Jack to go with him. Come on, let's go! Jack didn't even know how to drive, but he figured it would be a good chance to learn. I don't understand why you're doing this. I don't either, but I want to do it. You wanted to be a writer. That's why I want to do it. I want to get him on paper. Can't he get himself down on paper? Mother, it'll be all right. I get on the bus in Omaha, right? They traveled with Neal's girlfriend, Stevie, a runaway teenager he picked up in Iowa. Dubuque. You know what I mean? Dubuque, Iowa. A lot of good-looking girls come from Iowa. They're all corn-fed little girls. Beautiful little things. So anyway, I'm sitting there on the bus, and this little thing is such a beauty, Jack... My ma would be there with some little ritz crackers waiting on the table. I go over there, read the paper, and look at her eyes. She had beautiful eyes, these perfect eyes, man. [Engine starts] Whoo! Beat, beat, beat. Hey, Jack, this little chick back here just wants to settle down and make me miserable. Think she'll get away with it? Well, I kinda doubt it. When you really fell in love, what kind of woman would you fall in love with? Love? Yeah, love. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Love. Well, you know, maybe one you did. Well, if that's the case, maybe I oughta... What? Try and fall in love with ol' Stevie-weevie. How do you like that, big buddy? O.k., big buddy. Let's try it. Are you kidding? All right. 7:05. Provided this is Wednesday, we're right on time. Gee, everybody looks so accustomed to everything. Are you meeting him here? Yeah. Hey, looks like old dick's moved uptown, huh? All right, Jack. You've got the tuxedo. Stevie, you're wearing underwear, and I'm taking the zoot suit. Gimme that. Let's go! Come on. For me, it began on a date with another man. I was studying to be a painter at the art institute in San Francisco. Dick was a friend of Neal's from the old days. We were very much in love and used to talk about marriage endlessly. I say used to, because that night turned out to be one of the last times I ever saw him. Short? Oh! I think I can help you. Just tell me when to stop. 10, 20, 30... Whoa. 40...50... 60. Hey. It's o.K. Thanks, two-brew. I'll get it back to you. Money's no problem. Money is, uh... Is the least of my problems. Yeah. It's a far cry from larimer street, huh? Yeah. It sure is. This guy used to be one of the best one-handed bank shots at skully's pool hall. Used to be. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Here's my date. Carolyn, this is Stevie. Hi, Stevie. Hello. Jack. Hello, Jack. And...neal. Neal. Dick talks about you all the time. You know what he did this time, Carolyn? Drove here straight from New York in three days. Why? You don't know him. He don't need a reason. He just needs gas. Later, Neal and Jack ran out of cigarettes. They stared at the butts in the ashtray, but they didn't smoke them. I don't know if I was flattered or insulted. I only knew that something had begun. I was interested in these two characters from the start. All the men that I knew in those days either talked about business or themselves. Jack and Neal didn't seem to give a damn about either. I'd love to read your book, Jack. Well... There's still a, uh, discernible trace of wolfian influence in the more picaresque sections. Freshen your cocktail? Yes, please, Jack. Is he really as a good a writer as he acts like he is? That's not an act. He's really a good writer. You guys are funny. Oh, no, no. He's serious. I think you're serious, too. Well... What it is, is, um... See, we got a deal. You're not supposed to think. Oh, is that right? Well, if I did what I was supposed to do, I wouldn't be getting drunk in the middle of the afternoon, would I? So why are you doing it? So why'd you ask me? We're just goofing around. Well, so am I. O.k. O.k. O.k. O.k. O.k. O.k. During the day, Neal sold blood to pay the rent. I studied at school. Jack struggled to finish his novel. At night, we met at bud's bop shop, a jazz place that Neal knew. They knew him, too. What a Romeo. Yeah. Girls really go for him. Ira calls him the Adonis of Denver. Who's ira? Ira steiker, old powermouth, the poet. Sounds like a heavy crush. It is. Are you serious? Love at first sight. But-- but, Neal-- Neal doesn't-- Neal doesn't what? Hmm? Neal does whatever he feels like, but only in the company of friends. Does that include US? Friends? Sure. If you never take his word for anything. Promise me you'll never take his word for anything. [Whistles] Hey, careful with my book, huh? Ahem. It's 7:00 in the morning, boys. Hello, sweetheart. I'm sick of sitting here alone while you two go out-- we're looking for work. Work, my sweet ass! Who's Camille? I don't know Camille. I've been reading about her all night. Jack, who's Camille? It's a nom de plume. You're Dean moriarity. He better not be, brother. Hey, it's fiction. [Sighs] You're running with that debutante, aren't you? I'm not running with any debutante. You know, you're getting real predictable, man. I guess we have her to thank for that. I'm going to tell you something. No, I'm not going to tell you. But I'll tell you this. Don't think about things you're not supposed to think about. I've been working my ass to the bone to provide you with the most wholesome environment I could. I'll do the first thing that comes into my head if you're not here to stop me. I know that. Now, shh! Now, shh! Come here, now. Come here. Come here, now. Come here. O.k. Ha ha ha ha. We're going to play now. Oh, goody. Ohh, goody! Damn you! Mmm! Ha ha ha ha. Hey, Jack, this ain't no peep show. Ha ha ha--aah! You! Listen! Listen! See this? You see that? Don't talk about it. Hey, old buddy, what the hell's the idea of leaving that around for her to see? It's my novel. I know it's your novel. Find something else to write about but me. Haven't you got one thought of your own? What's eating you? Nothing's eating me, Jack. She's right, you know. This place is a dump. A man's home, my friend, is his castle. You know what I mean, Jack? So, you hit the sack with him yet? With whom? Dicko. Whom do you think? Maybe. What a thing to ask. That's a hell of a thing to ask. Sorry. I don't mean to get personal. I'd have thought we were too intimate to start getting personal now. I was only thinking of you, sweetheart. How often? When I think of it. I personally think of you a lot. But I'm not uncouth enough to mention it. [Whistles] He asked me to marry him. What an asshole. You going to do it? I don't know. What do you think? I think he's an asshole. You going to? I might go to Los Angeles. I got a job offer down there. You got a job offer down there? Yeah. Have to quit school. I don't know if I'm ready. School's full of assholes. Could you alternate invectives occasionally? Sorry. We don't all have that Ivy league vocabulary at our fingertips. That's not what I mean. Yeah, forget it. Are you nervous because she said she might leave? Me? I'm not nervous. You know, travel broadens the outlook. You know that. It's just that... I've been meaning to make tracks myself lately. The longest I spent in one spot since jail. Oh, yeah? Where you going? Not L.A. No? No. Too bad. 'Cause I just made up my mind I am. When did you do that? When I pictured myself being married to an asshole. [Plays kazoo] What are you going to do with that, t.p. The cow palace? Nope. I'm going to finish typing my book. I'm through fooling around. I'm going to play this thing like Charlie Parker. Bennies. Forget it. I need them. What's the big hurry all of a sudden? No hurry, same hurry. You know, just fame, overnight success, house in the hills, a little lady, picket fence, a couple of kids, a station wagon. Like something a little better than a flophouse? Yeah, a little bit better. [Plays kazoo] You sucker, Jack. Sucker? Sucker for what, Neal? [Plays kazoo] You know, you're crazy. Yeah, crazy. And I'll bet ira steiker has this sold by the time I get back to New York. New York? Yeah. I'm going to ask Carolyn if she wants to go back east with me. Besides, you two probably want your privacy back again. Besides, uh, this is no place to be a writer. I'm going to the post office, then Carolyn's. Yeah, it would be nice having some time alone, wouldn't it, hon? Jack. New York's no place to be a writer, either. There's too many people trying to be famous. So you skirt the authorities, old boy. You try to remember that. You didn't say you'd think it'd be nice if we spent some time alone again, hon. We've never been alone. We were in the car on the way to New York. So we were. You know, you're excellent company when you're driving. Well, it's nice to excel at something, honey. You know... I'm no whiz kid like Jack or ira, but they're just using you anyway. I know. What would they write about if it wasn't for you? I'm going out, Stevie. What are you doing with two t-shirts? All I own are two t-shirts. You're crazy. I know I'm crazy. Don't do anything crazy, Stevie. [Door closes] [Thunder] I broke my nail. Jack waited for Neal to appear. Stevie knew him better and vanished into the streets of the city. Jack traveled east. For the first time, he was on his own. He'd gained a book, but the cost had been high. Neal and I had each other. I stayed in school and he got a job. We found a little cold water flat on haight street. We wrote to Jack, but he didn't answer. After that he was never mentioned, but he was always in our thoughts. The war had been over about five years. A new decade had begun, and we were just three Americans. On the road? Do you mean that? Look, if we could just see Mr. Ogden-- he told me to tell you we don't accept unsolicited spare tires. Shit. If he'd only fucking read it. They all have. Robots! That's what they are, a bunch of fucking robots! Mr. Ogden? Excuse me. Excuse me. Mr. Ogden. I'm ira steiker. This is Jack kerouac. You remember, of course. I submitted Mr. Kerouac's book here to you. That isn't a book. It's a spare tire. Never mind the paper, ogden. Did you read the writing? It isn't writing. It's typing. What the fuck do you know about writing, you ill-bred Android? Perhaps not a lot, but I do know about you and your friend here. Everyone in the industry does. I'm as anxious as the next man to find a point of view to sell. But yours isn't going to make it, sweetheart. You all lack such charisma. My name is Jack kerouac. Maybe Neal's right, you know? Maybe we ought to go to San Francisco. I've been there. Maybe we ought to be anyplace other than here. Look, uh, you know, I don't think they're all that happy. I get letters from Neal-- I don't want to hear about it. Well... If I go-- if I go... Who's gonna take care of you? I don't need anybody to take care of me. And I am getting goddamn sick and tired of everybody thinking how fucking inept I am! I didn't say you were inept. Only you and Neal can burn up some highway? I thought you needed order to write. All I need is a pencil. O.k., calm down. Why, huh? Only you and Neal can wallow in it? So go with me! Go with me! No. I am not going to go with you. I'm not going to go with anybody, but I'm going. That's right, Jack. Come on. Get angry. Come on. Get angry and stay angry until you get what you want. Jack went one way, and ira went another. Jack's road led to more books. Ira's led straight to Neal. "Momus in whom I am cognizant without matter. "Light dripping out of the sun! "Momus, momus! Son of night! "Momus! Invisible coalitions! "Deranged industrialists! "Ghostly nations! "Insulin asylums! "Momus! Momus! "Cocksucker in momus! "Malignant bombs! "Malignant bombs! Glass jism!" Very good, ira. Ha ha ha! I'm not finished. What do you think? Well, I guess I'm kind of old-fashioned, but I sort of go for the... Love song of j. Alfred prufrock. Eliot. Oh, you mean the bank clerk. The world's big authority on the end of civilization. Want to know about civilization? Ask any bum on the bowery after he's had 12 shots of sterno. The puke-encrusted scabs on his face are a more eloquent poem than eliot ever wrote. Eliot. So, um... How long are you here for, ira? I don't know. I'm going down to Mexico. Maybe even farther south. Would you like to go with me, Neal? You got gas money? Gas money? They got free tea growing in goddamn fields down there. Then we'll just get high driving around with the windows open, huh? Something like that. What do you say, honey? I can't go to Mexico. I have a whole semester of school left. Can't you put it off? Put it off? Until when? Until we get strangled by bullshit? Neal, this entire society is decadent, man. It's diseased. There's a definite conspiracy, you know, to choke every man, woman, and child in america on the feces of mediocrity, like this won ton for example. Waiter! There's a turd in my soup! Hey, come on. Must you be so loud? I'm sorry if I'm a threat to you. You're not a threat to me. I'm a threat to everybody. I know that. Maybe I could learn some table manners. I don't know. [Sighs] Being polite, seems like such an arrogant gesture to me. I see a lot of stupid pain in this world, and it makes me angry, so I shout. What else am I going to do with my yap, run for office? Neal is the only truly fearless person I've ever met. I hate to see him get swallowed up by the same shit that's turned this whole generation into a constipated pack of cowering illiterates, that's all. Is that what you think I am? I don't know what you are, except in love with the same person I am. So, we have too much in common to be anything but friends. What do you say? I'm sorry. I'm not accustomed to hearing a man saying anything like that. Who would you rather hear say it-- Deborah kerr? Am I supposed to feel guilty about this, too? Excuse me. Wait, Carolyn. I'm sorry. Carolyn, wait! Carolyn! Wait! I'm sorry, Neal. I understand. Go home. I'll call you later. Right. Listen, ira. I'm in love with that woman. Everyone just has to get hep to that fact, you understand? [Coughing] [Jazz music plays] Ha! [Television playing] [Woman] Aah! [Man] Who are you? Please shut the door! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Aah! Aah! [Sighs] So what are you doing down here? Ah, you know... I went nuts. I'm like that 24 hours a day. I know. I'm totally insane. 'Cause of me? Ha ha! Yeah. Yeah. Can I do anything for you? Yeah. God, you are the most lascivious person I ever met. Yeah. But I love you from my heart. I love her, Stevie. I don't give a rusty fuck for that or nothing. [Tires screech] "Momus who horrified me "out of my natural atmosphere. "Momus whom I repudiate. "Arise in momus. "Dripping from the sun in momus. Cocksucker in momus." Oh! [Footsteps] Honey, uh... I'm home late. Hey, but I'm not that late, huh? [Carolyn] Does that include US? [Jack] What, friends? Sure. If you never take his word for anything. Promise me you'll never take his word for anything. [Retching] Hey. They're smoking opium up in your room, man. I know. I'm working. That's good stuff. So is this. [Retching] So how come it's always back in the mail, huh? [Belches] Oh, hey, man. I forgot. This came for you Tuesday. What's that? From your publishings? No, my mom. It seems I'm 30. Oh. Well, happy birthday, then. Thanks. [Flushes] Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Uh, honey. Hey, I know what's going through your mind right now, and it hardly warrants your attention. These are my friends. That's all they are. It has nothing to do with US. I'm pregnant. Huh? I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Oh, boy, did you hear that? I'm going to have a kid. If it's a boy, we'll call it Jack. Neal, Neal, put me down. What do you say? Honey. Put me down. Now, come on, honey, please. No. I was going to be a painter. Well... I was going to be free. You are. Oh, is that right? Is that right? Then why do I feel like an asshole? Because you got caught. Carolyn, you expect too much. Not from you, I don't. You're too scared not to expect something. Is scared what you call committing yourself to somebody? I commit myself to many people. That's your excuse for what I saw? I don't make excuses. You don't make commitments. I love you. Understand that? But there are other people in the world. And they're about to have company. O.k. O.k. [Sighs] All right, honey, what are we going to do? We? Hey, let's get married. Oh, Neal. You can't take care of yourself, let alone a kid. I'm an adult. I know you're an adult, Carolyn. But I love you. Don't make me laugh. What do I have to do? Want me to make a list? Yeah. Make a list. For one thing, we have to move. Move? Move. Come on, honey. Gee whiz. [Mumbles] The rent's all right here. Of course it is, Neal. It's a slum. Sure, it's a slum, but you always liked it before. Things were different before, you know what I mean? Yeah. If we're going to do this, let's do it right. O.k., how are we going to get the money? I'd quit school, work for as long as I can. You can sell the car. Sell the car? Sell the car. Sell the car? Aw, come on, honey. Sell the car? * dear one * the world * is waiting for the sunrise * * every Rose * is covered with dew * and while * the world * is waiting for the sunrise * * and * my heart * is following you hi, honey. Hi, honey. Let me take that plant. Here's Oscar. Thank you. You're welcome. How you feeling? Great. Did you have any trouble finding the place? No. Neal was determined to accept responsibility. [Bawling] * the world * is waiting... He pursued it the way he once pursued freedom. * and my heart is calling for you * but, like freedom, the road was fraught with peril. * his sleepy mate is calling * * and * my heart * is calling you * you better hurry up and get dressed, honey. They're going to be here any minute. This guy's a what? I think he's a chemical something. They just moved in. What are we supposed to talk about? Well, I don't know, honey. I just want to know one neighbor, just one. You weren't so anxious to know our neighbors back in haight street. Most of them went to jail before you could say hello. That's something I could talk about. That's not funny, Neal. Well, I'll be sure not to mention it to your friends. We don't have any friends. [Doorbell rings] Right. Right. O.k. All right, what are the names again, honey? Bob and Betty bendix. O.k. All right, I'll be right there. Thanks. Bob and Betty bendix. This korean thing's got to be the kookiest darn scrape we've ever gotten into. Betty's cousin skip was over there. To hear him tell it, today's army's a pretty hang-loose type operation. Did you serve? One to five. Pardon me? What? Dinner's ready. Oh. I'll get your drink, dear. Oh, thank you, darling. I don't know if Carolyn said anything to you, but Saturday morning the kiwanis club's having a pancake breakfast. Maybe we could get you to come down and man a spatula. I have to go to the bathroom. O.k. Come on, Ricky, finish your breakfast. O.k. You haven't even touched those eggs. David's practically finished. David's just a big showoff. How do you expect to grow if you don't eat? I sure would like something different for breakfast. What do you think this is, a hotel? Nobody's talking to you, David. What would you like? Probably hot dogs and ice cream. That's exactly what I had in mind and maybe a chocolate bar for dessert. More coffee, Betty? Bob, more tapioca? Oh, no. We really have to go. Have you seen this? Ha ha ha! That's good. Well, that was darn good feed. Darn good what? Darn good feed. Right. Right. Right. Well, we really have to go. A wonderful dinner. It was nice to meet you, ned--Neal. If you can make that Saturday thing, we'd like to have you come. Bye-bye. Thanks again. * oh, la la la la * la la la la * la la la la * la la la la la * la la * Neal! [Baby crying] Kerouac! Hey, Shakespeare. Kerouac! You got a ship. Sign here. You got anything else? You've been hanging around here all week waiting for a ship. Not to there. Pal... There ain't no other place to go. Take it or leave it. * I'd give my whole life for * * aah-aah-aah * if I only had this dance * * and when the song is over * * ooooh * she'll be goin' home with you * * what can I do? * what can I do? * my love for you * [Doorbell chimes] Jack? Yeah, Jack. By god, this is great. I can't bear to drink alone in my condition. What condition? I'm broke! Come on! Ha ha ha ha. Let's go, huh? God knows I love her. I love her a lot. I can't even look her in the eye no more. So, you've got a damn tragedy. I have. How does she look? Like a married woman. Hey, tell me about those Mexican babes. I'll bet they're hot little mamas, huh? Yeah, sure. Does she ever, uh... Does she ever talk about, um... Me? Only when I fuck up, which is 14 or 15 times a day. The railroad's sending me on a hold-down tomorrow. Two weeks living in a goddamn caboose. Know what that's like for me, Jack? It's a goddamn vacation. It's time off. Hey, why don't you stay at the house? Keep her company while I'm gone. Got a room in the attic. No, Jack. She's not going to nag you. No. I promise that. Come on. We'll hit bud's, then we'll go home. Let's go. Isn't it kind of late? Shouldn't you call first? Bud's doesn't close till sunup. No, but I meant... Come on. It's like old times. Tonight we wail... Tomorrow... I hit the road. I, uh, sorry about that. Ha ha. Come on. Forget that. Come on! Mommy, Jamie wet the bed again. O.k., honey, I'll be in there in a minute. [Sighs] [Tires screech] Damn! What a car! Oh, what a driver! Hey, what a night for romance. You son-of-a-bitch. God, hey, don't you pout now. Come here. Hey, hey! Somebody better get down to business. I'm going to jump on that gear shift. Well, he's got a wife and children in that house. Oh, do you? Uh-uh. Well, then, you're elected. [Giggling] Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Quiet! [Coughing] Shh! Shh! Hello, Jack. You're in over your head, ain't you, girl? Mommy, could I watch TV after lunch? Yes, honey, if you keep the sound down. The others are napping. Where's Neal? Psst. Where's your father? Where's daddy? He's at work. There's coffee on the stove. I'm sorry about last night. I was, uh... I was drunk. Actually, uh, I was afraid to come here and see you. [Cathy] Will he come back today? No, honey. I still am afraid to see you. Don't use all the milk. I need it for Cathy's lunch. Will you stop talking bullshit? I don't have... Anything else to talk about. Cathy, honey, will you go in your room? [Jack] Carolyn... Carolyn... I'm just tired of being treated like a piece of garbage. You're not a piece of garbage. Well, he makes me feel like one. He makes me look like one. He makes me act like one. You're not one. You're not a piece... Betty, there's a cezanne exhibit next week. Would you like to go? Who? Betty. Oh, thank you, sir. Jack, it was a pleasure. The pleasure was all mine, Bob. What was the name of that weed killer again? Sluggo. You can't beat it. We'll do that tennis thing real soon. Betty...the earth moved tonight. Why, you little charmer, you. I guess we better get out of here while we can. I guess we better. Good night, now. Good night. Don't trip over the sprinkler. Good night. It was just the guy next door. Will you stop it? This is the toughest thing I ever had to do in my life. Are you kidding? He'll probably be so excited, he won't stay for dinner. How can you say that? He loves you. He's the father of your children. He loves you, too, but did that stop him from dumping you in that hotel? [Car approaches] Thanks a lot. Catch you later. It's him. This is the toughest thing I ever had to do in my life. Just stand there. I got an idea. My best pal... And my best gal. Oh, god, honey! Listen, I've been such a fool, honey, just such a fool. Neal, put me down. I was a pig, honey. It'll be different for the rest of our lives. Excuse me, Jack. [Door closes] Ha ha. You told him? Somebody had to. Did you mean what you said out there, about the rest of your lives being different? He always says that. Well, I always mean that, Carolyn. Well, I mean, I've tried my best, honey. God, do you think this would have ever happened if I didn't know that? My best pal... And my best gal. Choooo. If I thought you could make her happy, even for a minute... Right? Right. Oh, no, no, no, Jack. I'm, uh, I'm too selfish to make anybody happy. That's the way I saw it. You looked so miserable. I wouldn't say i'm exactly miserable, Jack. Come on, Neal. Jack said you couldn't look me in the eye anymore. Did you tell her that? Do you want to go to Mexico or don't you? Yeah. Do you? No. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Everything I want, I've got right here... What you've got. Oh. What about your writing, Jack? I can give that up. Just because it didn't work out for you, doesn't mean it won't for me. You'll punch into a job 9:00 to 5:00, come home, rake leaves, write? Yeah. Bullshit! She doesn't believe that for a minute. Yes, she does. No, I don't. I'm doing it anyway. I don't want you to do it. Well, Neal does. Is that who you're doing it for? I'm doing it for you both, for all three of US. Well, what do you want? I don't know. I just wish people would stop being pissed off at me all the time. Oh, honey, we're not pissed off at you. God, I guess I just expected too much. No, we both expected too much. Do you think you can make her happy, Jack? I don't know. Why not? He doesn't expect a thing anymore. Shit. [Sighs] I'm keeping my favorite chair. All right. And I get to use the bathroom whenever I want to. You have to knock. Give me back my razor. No, you're not. I'm keeping the razor. We'll share it. You had the razor-- life for most is a lonely highway. Expectations are like billboards, a diversion but not an improvement. Neal, Jack, and I decided to throw away the map. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Would you guys like a beer? Oh, my god! Is that marijuana? Ugh! Ha ha ha ha. Good night, Neal. Good night, Jack. Good night, honey. Good night, greasy. You got that? You got to kick the thing to move the train. O.k., then twice--1, 2. Then you drop that, shut the door. You got it, Jack? Boy, that meat loaf sure was good. Well, thank you, Bob. More wine, anyone? Uh, no. More wine, darling? No, dear. I have to get the coffee. No, honey, I'll get it. No, thank you, sweetheart. I have to get the dessert. Excuse me. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. [Radio sportscaster] There's sort of a hush over the crowd here in Milwaukee, a feeling which pervades everybody here, knowing that any one of these hitters can change the entire complexion of the entire world series. Here's the pitch. There goes a fly ball to deep left center field. It's going, going... It's a home run! Gone! That's gone, man! That was a home run. That's a great game. They win this one, they'll be crazy in New York. I'll tell you something. We're going to be crazy in California in about... 60 seconds here. We're already crazy. Mm-hmm. [Coughs] The beer gave me a stomach ache. Mmm. Ahh! It's god's country, though, ain't it, son? Mm-hmm. Ahh. Yoo-hoo! Guess who's in the paper today? Your friend steiker. Young lady, march into your room and take that dress off. Yeah, he was arrested for that poem. You know, the one about the--ahem-- glass jism. It was seized by the police. What do you mean seized? You know, seized. There's going to be a trial and everything. According to that, the only place he's going is to jail. He's not going to jail. They ain't going to make that stick. The only thing it's going to do, it's going to make him famous, the poor bastard. What's wrong with being famous? Oh, come on, Jack. Listen, here, you know, we all got to serve. But the famous, they have to serve as an example. Gee. That's really clever, Neal. You got a real way with words, you know. ...top out the eight inning, New York 6, Milwaukee 2. Got a cigarette? Yeah, honey, right here. That typing's not bothering you, is it? In the old days, he'd do it in the same bed as me and Stevie. You're getting a running jump on things, aren't you, sport? Well, champ, three days, Jack's got seniority. And when he's making that kind of bread, well... Well, you know. Mexico-- the land of romance. I just got to see it once, Carolyn. I know. Are you sure? I mean, are you all right with Jack and all? I'm o.K. With me and all. Ever since Jack's been here, it's been great to be around you. You've been nice to be around, too. Oh, is that right? Well... * peg of my heart * my little oopie doopie * you sure do look cute when you're happy. Ha ha. Ha ha. You can charm the pants off me when you are. Ohh! [Typing stops] [Typing resumes] Oh, god. You know, he's the only thing that stands between US and divorce. Ha ha ha. Are you o.K.? Are you? Is she? I think so. Well, then, what the hell? What the hell? I'll miss you, Jack. I'll miss you, too. I love you, man. I love you, too. Yeah, well... Hey, listen, if we made a run for it, I don't think she could catch US. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Now, get out of here. Come on, let's go. Hey! Line up! Line up! Hup! Hup! Let's go! Hup! All right, you ready? All ready? Whoo! Ha ha ha ha. [Telephone rings] Ha ha ha ha. Hello? Just a minute. Jack, it's for you. Hello? Hi, there. Remember me? I remember you. It's pretty hard not to with all the press your pal keeps getting. Know what I mean? What? Nah, yeah, I can, yeah. Yeah, bye. What's the matter, Jack? I just sold on the road. All eastbound passengers... Final call. Final call. Be back in a month... Maybe two. Just going to take the money and run. Why not? I might have to do some publicity. You have to play ball with these guys to a certain extent. I put some toothpaste in your bag. I'll take care of your books. Then they said something about Hollywood. Jack, get on the bus. So, uh... Who would have guessed? You go for a ride with a guy, and... 10 years later, they publish a novel about it. It's amazing. I'll be back. When, Jack? Why when? I didn't ask you when are you coming back when you dumped me at the hotel. I knew you were gonna bring up that goddamn hotel. It's not the hotel. I just got my book published. You want me to ignore it after 10 years? I've been holding down the fort for 10 years. And I'll hold it down when I get back. You don't believe I'm coming back. Do you believe I'm coming back? Jack, it's all right if you're not coming back. Oh, great. I just mean... Look, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, when did I ever know what I was doing? [Bus motor starts] Bye. Yeah. He didn't hear a word I said, did he? Neal? Huh? No, I didn't hear what you said. Well...gee, I guess if you didn't bring your bongos, we'll just have to talk. [Audience laughs] For any of you folks who've been out testing your bomb shelters the last few months and missed the news, Jack's book-- on the road-- is a smash hit that's turning the literary world upside down. It's spawned a whole new bohemian lifestyle overnight. Hope you didn't change your t-shirt just for US, Jack. Seriously, if you haven't read it, Jack's book's a pretty shocking yarn about a bunch of kooky characters running around looking for-- in the argot of negro jazz musicians-- kicks. It's kind of a free love sort of thing where everybody seems to spend most of their time taking drugs and avoiding work, razors, and bath tubs. Jack calls these frantic characters "beatniks," don't you, Jack? No, actually. That is some term that some columnist made up. Columnists. They don't seem to like you very much, do they? Don't they? They sure seem to be writing a lot of articles. Well, I think that anything that threatens the basic decency and moral fiber of American life deserves to be written about... Don't you, Jack? Yes, I do. Hmm. And what is it, exactly, that you write about, Jack? Well, uh... I don't know. Uh... Friendship, uh... Uh... Hmm. Friendship. Now, can we take it that your hero of your story-- moriarity-- is that a fictionalized character, or is that indeed a friend that you know? He's a frie--uh... He's a fictionalized friend of mine. I see. And you identify with his lifestyle. [Television] That's the way you think people should be living-- dropping out of society, taking drugs... Neal? Hmm? It's worse than the last time. Well, do what I do-- don't watch it. Responsibility isn't necessarily curtailed... [Telephone rings] [Audience laughs] Hello? ...taking responsibility for the sort of thing... Of course we are! We're watching it right now! Well, you look great! Neal, it's Jack. Hang on a second. [Audience laughs] Hey, Jack! Hey, where are you, man? I don't know. I'm in some dump hotel somewhere. It's a zoo, man. Hey, hey... Hey, Neal, listen to this. Don't tell Carolyn, o.K.? But these guys-- these guys fixed me up with some tomato from vogue magazine. What page are you on? 39. She's on page 39. Look her up. No offense. Hey, when you comin' back, man? I don't know. Come on, don't spoil it. Spoil what, having some dork-wipe trash you on TV like that? What, Larry? He's a good guy. Larry's a good man. It's all show business. The guy's, uh, picking up the tab, you know? [Chuckles] Aw, god, Jack, you out with that dork-wipe? Yeah. But... He's a good guy. Wait a second, o.K.? I'll, uh... Basically, hold on a minute. Hey, larr... You want to talk to, uh... Dean moriarity? The fellow in your book. Yeah. Sure. Hello. [Chuckles] Hey, you must be one kooky character, mister. Listen, I really loved the scene in the book when you-- good god. What'd he say? What do you think... He said? Beats me. [Laughing] [Carolyn] Jack wrote to Neal that he should be proud instead of worried. Like boswell and Johnson, their friendship had created art. Neal replied that he didn't know much about what he liked, but he didn't like art at all. [Music] And your neighborhood Plymouth dealer... [Music] Invites you to see and drive the 1960 Plymouth, still the new solid way to give you solid satisfaction... And to enjoy... The Steve Allen Plymouth show, presenting... William bendix! Beat generation novelist Jack kerouac. [Carolyn] Jack wrote back that Neal misunderstood. What was good for him was good for US all. Neal said that that letter was the first good fiction Jack had written in months. All right, folks, get it right here! Beatnik kit, only $3.00. [Continues indistinct] After that, they stopped writing altogether. They didn't really need to anymore. On the road had turned their lives into an open book. Smile, Jimmy. If you really enjoy this, I can give you an extra prize-- a poem for only 50 cents more, a great gift for grad or dad. You, mister? You're a long way from San Francisco. I'm on my way home. [Carolyn] Finally Neal decided that it was time to move on. But little did we know that he'd already stayed too long. [Flute and bongo play] "Index your pablum. "Atomic mists. "Born in broken sheets of time, "open the stainless steel morning "drunken with isotopes. "Open wall-less windows "with broken sheets of time. "Born "with silent words. Your rusty eggs..." Give me a shot of Tequila. "...of robot eyes..." Beer. Wine. 2.50 minimum. "...open your anxious countdown to a..." Bud's bop shop. Right. 2.50 minimum. "...in the mad rush, the library yawns. "Some cat stops you, begging silver tears..." You're out of your fuckin' mind. "...stains some noontime café "with the final magic of relativity." [Audience snaps fingers] Hey, cassady, how you doin'? Hey, man, how are you? I'm doin' pretty good. Hey, uh... Float me a 20. I'm going south... Tonight. O.K.? I'll get it from swifty at the five spot. Let me finish up here first. All right, but, uh... o.K. All right. What do you think? Why? This is great. This is what's happenin', man. Wait. Wait. What is this? Maynard? This--this is the scene, man. I gotta eat, too, you know. Give the man a drink, son. You're in the presence of greatness. This is Dean moriarity. The cat in on the road. You mean, uh, kerouac's book? Wow. Uh, say, man, you holdin' any boo? Who? You know. Uh, Mary Jane. Tea. Pot. Marijuana! Tell maynard I'll meet him at the five spot. Dean moriarity, my ass. Guy doesn't even know what boo is. Hey, man. My man, I hear you say you was goin' to the right--right spot? Uh-huh... You mean the five spot, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I'm going there if it's still there. Know what I mean? I know what you mean, man. [Horn honks] What, you need a ride? Yeah. O.k., let's get the fuck outta here, huh? Sure it's cool? Come on. O.k. All right. You really the cat in that book, man, they're talkin' about? Not really, man. Not really. Aw, man. That's a pretty hep book, man-- swipin' cars, smokin' reefer. Man, you're a pretty famous literary figure, man, you know? Hey, can you get rich off of that? What, what? Do I look rich to you? Do I look rich? Huh? Hey, man, any dude who's got two sticks of reefer and a wine spoodee-o-Dee's rich in my opinion. Well, I'll tell you somethin'-- I think, I think, uh... I think we're about halfway there. You know? Guess the whole wide world's gonna want to smoke reefer when they read that book, man. Yeah, well... Listen. Everybody wants to be hip. I tell ya, even ol' Jack wishes he was a spade. [Chuckles] I don't know why, man. Yeah, me, either. You can't get no work but the shit work. Yeah, well... Take settin' you up-- you think I'm proud of that? Why don't you pull over? All right. [Siren] Uh... You ever been to Mexico? No, man. Neither have I. Thank you. That'll be all. I have to go there. What are you gonna do, break him out of jail? I put him in. He put himself in. The man was spoiling for it. You don't even know him. I read your goddamn book, didn't I? That isn't him. Oh? Do you want to ruin your career? You've got enough enemies without hanging around with narcotics felons. He'll get five-to-life. They'll let him out in two. You can't stop it. I have a responsibility to him. Well, what about your responsibility to your work? We live in less than liberal times, my friend. Send him a check. [Carolyn] From friends we expect loyalty. From writers, only sequels. Neal went to prison. Jack was sentenced to posterity. Something had ended. They used to call it "innocence." [Sitar plays] [Rock music plays] * purple haze * all in my brain * lately things don't seem the same * * I'm actin' funny, but I don't know why * * 'scuse me * while I kiss the sky * purple haze [bell rings] * all around * don't know if I'm comin' up or down * [girl] Aah! [Girl] Yahoo! * am I happy or in misery? * * whatever it is * that girl put a spell on me * aah! Hey, man, how far to the border? Mile. Mile. Mile, mile, mile. Tamale pie, huh? Ah, the chiquitas. Chiquitas, yeah. [Banging] Got a leakage hang-up, you know? What's your name? They call me sunshine. Sunshine... I'll tell you what. I want you to sneeze in the tires and, uh, shit in the radiator. Huh? [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello? Hello, sweetheart. Did you get the alimony? Sure did, Neal, right on time. I know you're laughin', Carolyn, but, uh, see... My I.O.U.'S good as my word. Neal, there's somebody here I think you might want to talk to. Well, uh, see, uh-- it's Jack, Neal. Hello? [Sighs] I'm here, Carolyn. Uh... What the hell's Jack doin' there? Well, he was down in Los Angeles. He hitchhiked, Neal. He hitchhiked? That dumb son of a bitch. He's not in great shape. Talk to him. No, I can't. Really, honey. But, Neal, he-- no, no, no. Can't, Carolyn. He's not in good shape. I gotta hang up 'cause it's a pit stop. You understand? O.k. I'll write. Take care of yourself. Hey, you know me. [Man] Midge, Scotty... I'm home. Jack, you better come on in now. It's getting cold outside. Looks like they're having a... Barbecue over there. Come on in, Jack. No. I'll wait here until the cab comes. Be warm in Florida. Guess I never should've left. Don't get asked to do these TV shows much anymore. What the hell, huh? Just felt like hitchhikin'. Give it the old... College try. Got drunk, gave it the old college try, and spent most of the time on the bus. Well, I'm glad you came, Jack. You mean it? Well, of course I mean it. We weren't lyin'. We really love you. I know that, Jack. What the hell did we do wrong? Oh, I don't think we did anything wrong. We just did it first. [Horn honks] [Honk honk] Here's your cab. Now, Jack, next time you take the train, o.K.? Sure. So, uh... Neal's hangin' out with the zippy-bippies, huh? Yeah. Got a string of girls as long as your arm. He says we were born before our time. Before our time? Yeah. Well...guy would say anything to get laid. Bye. [Cab motor starts] [Carolyn] Neal thought that life was destroyed by compromises. That was his weakness. Jack thought it was made by them, and that was his. I decided that compromises are like dental appointments... You're damned if you make 'em... And you're damned if you don't.
