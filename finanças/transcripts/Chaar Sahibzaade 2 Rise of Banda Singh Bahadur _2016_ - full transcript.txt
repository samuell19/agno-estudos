There is one God Truth is His Name God is the creator God is without fear God is without enmity God is immortal God is beyond birth God is by Himself, self-existent, and self-sufficient He is attained by the Grace of the true Guru Recite his name This was true in the beginning of creation This was true in the beginning of the ages This is true today True Here And Now. Satguru Nanak says that He will prevail forever more For six long years, The Mughal Empire could not curb the power of Banda Singh Bahadur! He fulfilled the dream of his Guru By establishing the Kingdom of Punjab, right next to the capital of the Empire He punished those who tormented the common man, and established the first Kingdom of Sikhs. Then marched from Lahore, the ugliest of all processions known to Man. To humiliate Banda Singh, he was dressed as an Emperor, and was marched to Delhi along with his two and half year old son and 740 Singhs in chains. Grant me this boon, God May I never refrain from the righteous acts Grant me this boon, God May I never refrain from the righteous acts Grant me this boon, God May I never refrain from the righteous acts May I fight all foes without fear in life's battles With confident courage, claiming the victory! Grant me this boon, God May I never refrain from the righteous acts May I fight all foes without fear in life's battles With confident courage claiming the victory! Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God' Rabindranath Tagore, the revered poet who wrote the National Anthem of India also wrote a poem paying tribute to the bravery and martyrdom of Banda Bahadur. Called "Bandhi Bir" Finally Banda was captured by the Mughals... Finally Banda was captured by the Mughals... Like a tiger he was caged, And brought to Delhi. Grant me this boon, God May I never refrain from the righteous acts May I fight without fear all foes in life's battles With confident courage claiming the victory! Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God' 'Truth is the ultimate God' Emperor of India, we have killed almost all of the Singhs in Punjab. And we have brought a few here in Delhi to be punished as you please, Lord. Spare the ones who accept our religion. And Those who don't, behead them! I am asking for the last time! Anyone who accepts our religion will be spared! Whoever utters this shall be happy and fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God' Ay! Soldiers! Get me one of them! Executioner! Take me in... Take me in first! First me! Let me die first No no!! First me! First me! Behead that one! May Thy Glory be grained in my mind and my Each Sikh pleaded to be beheaded before the other. Each day the sun rose, a 100 Sikhs were killed. Highest ambition be singing thy praises In 7 days, 700 were martyred. Three months have passed since we Killed 700 Sikhs. We killed 100 each day. Yet none of them showed any sign of nervousness. After every beheading, we were starting to loose hope Yet they remain as stubborn as ever Three months have passed of them rotting in hell, Yet neither Banda, nor any of his forty remaining men.. have agreed to accept our religion. Behead them all! When this mortal life comes to end When this mortal life comes to end May I die fighting with limitless courage.. I hope your not feeling fearful, son? Fear? What is that? Ah yes how would you know! It is not in the blood of Singhs Yes, just like how Baba Fateh Singh was. I'm inspired by him to uphold the principles of our religion. Here, its an order that you will kill your son! Singhs never harm or attack women and children.. its you people who have mastered this monstrosity! Take it! The Kazi handed over Banda's son To the custody of the Executioner Grant me this boon, God Banda kissed his son's red turban.. Looked at him and whispered in his ears, 'Glory to the Guru', He asked him to be strong. With confident courage, claiming the victory! The son said he had no worry... 'Glory to the Guru' were the last words he said Whoever utters this shall be happy, shall be fulfilled (chorus) 'Truth is the ultimate God' Banda Singh! I admit it, the look in your eyes terrifies me! It burns deep into my conscience! I shall destroy your eyes first, thrust you into darkness. Then cut you to pieces... Why did you stop? You can destroy my eyes... but what about the million other eyes which can see the sins you all commit? How will you destroy them? Was flayed with pliers. He was cut into pieces. Even such a torture could not shake Banda's faith in his being a Singh.. a Khalsa, till his last breath The very Khalsa Panth which was established at Anandpur, by Guru Gobind Singh Years back Anandpur, where calmness and serenity were in abundance... Where the energy and laughter of the Four Sons of The Guru lifted the atmosphere with love and peace But the joyous times were short lived, as if cursed. Wazir khan, the Governor Of Sirhind cheated on a peace treaty... in order to get Anandpur Fort vacated and attacked. While crossing the overflowing River Sirsa, The Guru's family got separated. The Guru took refuge in the Mud Fort at Chamkaur with his 40 Singhs and two sons. Wazir khan attacked him with a force of a million. Along with other Singhs, his elder son Baba Ajit Singh was martyred and later his 14 year old son Baba Jujhar Singh The greedy cook Gangu, in lieu of a big reward handed over.. the custody of the mother and the younger two sons of The Guru to Wazir Khan, who along with the Kazi conspired to pass a death sentence on the two children. The wall in which they were buried alive.. fell as if refusing to partner in the heinous crime. Seeing his unsuccessful, Wazir khan asked the executioners to behead the two young ones. This is to the extent, Guru Gobind Singh sacrificed his family as his commitment, to protect humanity. 1708 SIRHIND. Three years had passed since... The place where Guru Gobind Singh's two innocent youngest sons were walled alive.. and then martyred, was left as it was by Wazir Khan This was done in order to instill fear of his authority in public. But instead people would bow before the broken wall to pay their respects... Some even claimed they heard the sound of 'Waheguru' 'Waheguru' coming from the broken wall.... Every month on the date of their martyrdom, someone would come and light a diya(candle) on the broken wall but one knew who this was... Today as well, is the same date of this month.... Who was this? Who dared to challenge Wazir khan's authority? Razia quickly, light the candle and leave Kammrudin! Who lit this candle? I don't know Sir. I've just returned from my namaz prayers. Hey, you lady! Come back here. Kammrudin, tell me, didn't this woman cross the square just now? My eyesight has gotten weaker with age, Sir. But I can still see the difference between good and bad And no! I've never seen this woman here before. Did you light this candle? The light has been forver lit in our hearts by the Guru and it will remain so for generations to come.. Hey Girl! How dare you talk to an officer like that? Leave before you're jailed like all the others who remain loyal to the Guru and His family! Go! Go away! Kammrudin...! Yes sir? We can arrest people but how can we curb the voices which come from this wall! That's exactly why every time she comes Here to light the candle I let it burn for a while... and then put it out! That way her tribute is paid and no one loyal to the governor sees it. I don't know about others but every time I pass this place, I hear the sound of "Waheguru... Waheguru". Did you hear, Sir? 'Waheguru... Waheguru...' Rumours, my Lord, rumours! What voices saying 'Waheguru'? And from where? Who is left to lead the Sikhs, anyways? You killed the Guru's elder two sons at Chamkaur.. and the younger two here at Sirhind. The Sikhs and Hindus are now Frightened and as quiet as mice! There have been no disturbances from them at all. And to outsmart the Emperor you have given Lordship.. to two Sikhs Aali Singh and Maali Singh in your court. So, my lord, what is it that's still troubling you? causing you sleepless nights? Gobind! The Guru of the Sikhs! Every time I've attacked him, he's survived! I killed his sons, yet he's never come before me and accepted defeat. Even if I kill all the Sikhs, I won't be at peace as long as he lives! My lord! These two men will make the impossible, possible! Will you be able to kill the man who's escaped my sword time and again? Yes, Gobind will die with our first strike And then all the Sikhs Will in grief I feel reassured by your words already! Suchanand, fill their coffers! Give them whatever they want! Yes my Lord... The Guru is somewhere in the west with the Emperor. Let him never come here to the North. He must die! And go up there! Khan Saab, attack the Guru...!? It's not too late to reconsider the order you've just given... If I am to rule, I have to get rid of Him. Before He plans his next move against me. Oh Master, Oh Master Oh Master, Oh Master A man with his followers has raided our ashram and ruined its sanctity. He's had the audacity to kill our goats and cook them in our kitchen, And on top of all of that, He's seated himself in your cot! Who is has dared to do so? Master teach him a lesson he won't forget... Lift him up with the cot using your powers.. then smack him down on the ground... Then we'll go ask him! Go ask him?! No!! I will use my powers and get him here along with the cot! Now! Right before you all! Madho Das awaken! Shed your ego and your anger... Enlighten yourself... Did you hear something? No, we didn't hear you say a word, my Lord. Madho Das.. Only the pure soul can hear the voice of God and God can hear the voice of a pure soul. Do you realize why your mantras are failing? And why your heart is so heavy today? Why you're feeling nervous, like you never have before? The man at your ashram is no ordinary one! You seem disturbed that He and his followers have ruined the sanctity of this place. I don't mean to be critical. But you have killed.. animals in my holy place Blood has been shed in this ashram How can I now meditate at this the place? Guru Sahib said, 'That is exactly what I want to understand from you. Thousands of helpless innocent men, women and children.. are being butchered everyday by the Mughals. Which is that mantra you recite? Which does not alert your mind to notice such a carnage? Rajouri was your native place. Taavi, Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Jamuna, Ganga, Narmada. You travelled through these rivers and finally settled here on the banks of River Godavari. Take my advice, start your journey again. Along your way, you will find hard working poor farmers crying for help. Go wipe their tears.. God is waiting for you to make them smile again... Who are you? Guru Sahib said The One you know. Look not through your eyes but from within your conscience.' Oh! You are Guru Gobind Singhji? Yes Madho Das, the moment Saint Jaitt Ram of Daddu Dwara told Guru Sahib about you, we came straight here. I am honoured. Guru Sahib then told him, 'Bring glory to your name..' You are a spiritual warrior, surrender to the task you are destined for. You have a temperament of hunter. The common man, tortured by the rulers.. is as ignorant and innocent as the deer and her two babies who writhed in pain, After being struck by your arrow and died before you. You could not bear that sight and so you never hunted again. You broke your bow, and your arrows too. That pain hurt your conscience so much that it turned you into Madho Das from the carefree Lachman Das.' My Guru... I am... Guru Sahib asked, 'Yes, who are you? I am your Banda (man) Who are these tormentors who are shedding the blood of the innocent people? What way will you punish them? Toppling their cots with your tantric powers? The Madho Das famous for his tantric powers, died as he surrendered before you.. O'my god my Guru. Now this BANDA sits before You, Mould this Banda of yours into such a Singh, whose sword shall not hurt an innocent and never spare a tyrant! Guru Sahib then assures him, 'Banda I will make you such a brave soldier that your name will spell dread in the hearts of the tormentors! You will soon be a Khalsa - the Messiah of the poor and the tormented!' Guru sahib had settled down on the banks of River Godavari The camp had an air of mysticism. Everyday during prayer-time, the herd of deer.. would come and sit quietly in attendance. The peacocks and birds stopped singing and gathered around the prayer hall. His followers felt blessed. It was like heaven on earth. The horses are like an extension of your body in the battlefield. So it is very important to have a perfect coordination with your horse. It's a matter of time. This first thing you need to learn is how to defend your self. Come lets have a deul! No! In this way you are attacking but you have left your defense open! When you have your sword in hand, your eyes must focus on the enemy. Let your sword take care of drawing blood. And then the enemy's sword should not even scathe you. Battles are fought with courage and fought to protect our principals. The situation in Punjab is of grave concern. The need right now is to support the common man is to support the common man I would now like to make you familiar with the Rules of Battle. Even after so many years. Wow Just a little more training Guru Sahib advised them, 'If you want to help others from tyrants first make sure your defense is strong. It is not wise to get caught up in a rage You can get yourself killed in a battle When Banda asked for a clarification, Guru Sahib explained 'Only when there no hope of another battle Should you die as a martyr And so inspire generations to fight for your cause.' And it was beautiful place where Guru Sahib decided to camp Its not about the place, it is about the Guru Wherever he setlles, there settling down a heavenly place like Anandpur I am sure, if Mata Sundri, Mata Sahib Kaur and Bhai Mani Singhji would have come here, they would never want leave this place. I have heard that Anandpur was interesting and really full of life, as if festivities were happening every day. I want to know all about Guru Sahib, you have been with for quite a while now. Please, tell me. Madho das, there were frequent conferences. Poets came from all over the country. There was happiness all around, And you know what made everyone in Anandpur even happier? When brother...? When the four sons of Guru Sahib would laugh and happily play around. The crowds would be ecstatic! Sahibzaade (Princes) Sahibzaade (Princes) Sahibzaade (Princes) Sahibzaade (Princes) There was a town called Anandpur... Full of life.. There were four stars that shone over this town... They showered happiness in abundance These stars had dawned on the earth To make it even beautiful These four Princes.... Officer Zorwar Singh and Officer Fateh Singh! I command you to bring Aurangzeb and Wazir Khan before me now. No one wants to act like Aurangzeb. He's right, Brother! And no one wants to play Wazir Khan either! Mind your words! Right now, I'm not anyone's brother! I'm a ruler. and an extremely hot-tempered ruler! Oops! This ruler is in a bad temper. Don't worry! It's our turn tomorrow!! Both of you, do what I say. Bring the culprits before me or you both will be stripped of your ranks! Hold on. Wait, stop please! Singhji, do you mind pretending to be Aurangzeb for a little while? Be Wazir Khan for a while? What are saying, Sahibzaada (Prince)? Why should I be Aurangzeb? O never! I'm sorry but Wazir khan is our greatest enemy. I could never pretend to be him He's such a cruel man, if I ever happen to see him, I'll slay him!! Singhji please.... Please be Wazir Khan Please... Ok its fine... Gangu! Come pretend to be Aurangzeb for a while... No, no! O Gangu listen to me... Mata ji is waiting for me. I must get to the kitchen right now You want to go for a break to your village? If you agree to do what we ask, We will convince Guru Mother to give you eight whole days of leave... If that's the case, then its fine.. Be Wazir Khan! Not Wazir khan, but Aurangzeb! No! Wazir Khan! I saw him coming first. Hold on...First, decide between yourselves whether I'm Wazir Khan or Aurangzeb. Gangu, I will decide that! I want Aurangzeb before the ruler now! My Lord, I bring Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb. I intend to punish you for the crime you committed against our Guru Grandfather. But Singhs never attack anyone unarmed. I challenge you to a duel! If you win, I will spare you. But if I win, you must leave our country, never to return! Lord, I don't have the courage to fight you. I give up, and am ready to leave your country without a fight. Now, it's already late... Mata ji will be angry at me My Lord... Aurangzeb has run away! Mark my words! One day all the Mughals will run away from our beloved Country. My Lord. You've worked so hard. Aurangzeb ran away! You must be hungry? Shall we go and eat something? No! I still have a lot to do! Think again my Lord. I've cooked your favorite ghee churma (crumbs and butter)! Ghee churma!! The Court is adjourned! Grandma, hurry! Patience my child, I'm stirring hard! The butter's about to surface. The eldest will eat first. That's how he'll grow bigger! Why! If the younger eats first then he'll grow bigger! The one who is neither the eldest or the youngest will die of hunger! Even the butter knows how hungry you all are... A large amount has come to the surface. Impatient boys! Premo come, give this butter to the children. Just eating fresh butter, are you? Well... who's going to eat this churri? Me! Guru Mother. I'm really Hungry. Please give me some. Gangu why haven't you got the churri yet? Coming Mataji Gangu. For a bribe of just eight days leave.. you were prepared to become Aurangzeb. If you were offered a bigger bribe, what would you end up doing? Oh, I was just playing with the children... Taking a bribe even while playing. Bad idea! Yes... well... Son! You're late. What kept you? Guru Mother, There's been some recent movements of the Mughal army in the hills states around us. I was in a meeting with Guru Father... talking about this. Brother! Tell me. Why is our Sikh army, Much smaller than the Mughal Army? Tigers are always few in number, but they rule the forest! Zorawar Singh, come on pounce like a tiger! Okay Brother. Here we go! Brothers! Let me play too... let me join in... Please Fateh Singh. Stay away, you're still too young! Look at him. His stick is even taller than he is! When you've grown as tall as us, then we can play all these games together. Fateh Singh! Now step aside... Wohoo! Take it easy! You are getting excited Did you not say pounce like a tiger? Ah yes! But be careful.... I'm now as tall as both of you... Come stand next to me and check! You can't send me away now. Let me play Don't be stubborn. You could get hurt, Brother. So what? We can all get hurt when we play games, right? This is not a game. This is Gatka (Sword fighting) for real, you know? This is how one becomes battle ready. Now I definitely want to play. I want to go to battle too! Let me join you, or else I'll complain to Brother Ajit. O'Fateh Singh step back. Brother, lets play! Someone's going to get told-off today... Someone's going to get told-off today... Told-off today!! Told-off today!! Don't talk to him. Fateh Singh, what's up with you? Brother Ajit has told me that if anyone doesn't listen to me, or doesn't let me play with them, I must go and tell him straightaway... Brother leave him alone, play Come on! Let's play... Someone's going to get told-off today... Someone's going to get a told-off today... Oh! Okay then! Come and play with us Pay attention. Concentrate. And careful, you can get hurt... Seeing Baba Fateh play Gatka inspired Guru Gobind Singh to start the armed Sikh order, the Nihang Everyone loves Fateh Singh All four of the Guru's sons, always brought some element of surprise to everyday life... Anandpur was never so lively again. The families separated as they crossed the River Sirsa The elder brothers were martyred at Chamkaur The younger two and their Grandmother were caught at Sirhind The departure from Machhiwara was not an easy one...Guru Sahib went via Saloni to the village Jattpurra. On the way, he met a noble estate owner called Rai Kallah, who offered the Guru his Palace. My Guru Sahib You are a Guru, of the Hindus and Muslims together. How I can serve you, my Master? If you have an honorable and trustworthy man, then please send him to Sirhind. I have heard many rumors, and I want to know... What has actually happened in Sirhind to my mother and my younger two sons. Guru Sahib, My servant Noora Mahi's sister, is married in Sirhind. I can send him right away, and no one will suspect him. Razia...Razia...look it's me. I've come all the way from Raikot... It's been so long since we last met and I thought you might be annoyed with me... But why aren't you talking? What's wrong? Really mad at me? Razia... Noora... Please tell me what's happened to her and be honest Lakhi When Guru Sahib's younger sons were walled alive so cruely, Razia was standing amongst the crowd there. Brother Lakhi! Toddarmal has bought a piece of land from Wazir Khan.. He is cremating the Guru's mother and his sons there, hurry! What is going on here, Lakhi?? Great Effort Sir... Guru Sahib said, 'Mughals will be uprooted. One can count the years of their reign on the fingers of your hands now.' There is no sign of any pain on the.. one who sacrificed his family for humanity? No. Whenever we bring up the topic of His mother or His sons, He ends the conversation, before it can even begins.. saying 'always accept the ways of God!' Before we conclude today's session, Does anyone here have any questions? Guru Sahib. If someone commits a sin, must he pay for it, in this life? Everything is balanced. Guru sahib explained, 'If you commit a sin, you must pay for it!' Guru Sahib smiled and said, 'So you've finally arrived. You've come a long way.' Yes Guruji, please give us your blessings. Guru Sahib smiled and said, 'May God grant you your wishes.' Guruji, What is the difference between a sinner and a criminal? A sinner is a person who thinks of committing a sin. A criminal is a person who goes out and commits that sin. Can one read the mind of a sinner? A sinner's face has their sin written all over it. It can only be read by one's power of inner consciousness. That's something our revered Guru Sahib can do. Not ordinary people like us. Guru sahib reminded them, 'When our fifth.. Guru of Sikhs was called to Lahore on a pretext, He knew he was being tricked But those who love God, Always respect and accept what He has in store for them. Guruji, will the Turks who have been brutalizing innocent.. people with no provocation, pay for it in this life too? Guru sahib explained, 'As you sow, so shall you reap. By God's own rule, whatever sin you commit must be paid. When and where is upto God!' Guru Sahib, it's not that hot. I wonder why those Pathans were sweating so much? I observed a strange nervous restlessness in their eyes. Can you explain this? Guru Sahib said, 'Oh you pure souls, every being is a mystery. If you look into the universe of others.. you may end up becoming like them. Better to look into our own lives and unfold our own mysteries. Only then can we find peace within ourselves.' "Those who seek, only they find answers..." What are you thinking? I don't think it's right to betray Him by stabbing Him in the back. You've been so affected by the Guru after just one meeting? Didn't you notice the way he smiled at us? As if He knew already, what we're here for? Seeing him smile like that make me shudder. Didn't you see the honest look in his eyes? So peaceful... I only look into the eyes of my victims after I've killed them. To make sure they're completely dead! I'm going back tomorrow morning! Such a dedicated follower of the revered Guru! Don't forget. That man Wazir Khan is a devil! Remember what cruel death he put The Guru's children? If we go back without completing our task.. He will brutally kill our families! Now take Gods name and sleep silently Now, if you haven't the stomach for the job? You can just be on guard. I will do it! Thank you This is a map of Punjab Madho Das observe this map carefully... this is Anandpur Sahib.. Sirhind and this is Chamkaur. We have to eradicate the every tyrant from this territory Banda was fully trained as a warrior and absorbed.. the principals of Khalsa through the scriptures. Then Guru Sahib baptised Banda to be a Singh by offering him the Holy Amrit. When the True Guru is merciful, Then your desires will be.. It was a sight to witness what Waheguru had created.. on one side of Guru Sahib stood Bhai Daya Singh who was the first one to be baptized with Holy Amrit in Guru Sahib's presence and on other side was Banda Singh who was the last one to be baptized with Holy Amrit by the Chosen Five, in the presence of Guru Sahib. When the True Guru is merciful You will never grieve. The day I was baptized as a Singh even I felt the way do now. On top of the world! Bhai Daya Singhji, this turban. It is like a royal crown on one's head.. I will make this crown become the pride of Punjab. Where did you wear this crown the first time? Anandpur When ever you say Anandpur, I am reminded of the separation of the family. After their separation at the River Sirsa.. When did Mother Sundriji meet Guru Sahib? And where? Travelling through RaiKot and village Deena Kangad.. Guru Sahib settled down near the village Talwandi. Soon the followers began together there... And Wazir Khan? The Emperor shifted the Army stationed at Sirhind back to Delhi.. Wazir Khan calmed down.. Banda Singh, in no time there were so many followers in Talwandi.. that it took a while to move around A few steps, the place was full of life... This news reached Mother Sundri, she was in Delhi then. Welcome Sukha Singh? What brings you here? Guru Sahib is now camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi. Celebrations are being held. Everything is as it used it be. People are flocking there. This is the best news I've heard in a long while! You made me really nervous when you entered... I was worried of what you might say, I almost froze! Now just wait here, I must go and share this with Mata Sundriji... Wait! Bhai Sahib. This good news is not the cause of my nervousness... Oh! All the four sons of Guru Sahib and his mother... What has happened to The Sahibzaade and Mataji? Just a few left, all the other clothes of your children are ready Mata ji, God has answered your prayers! Sukha brings great news! Guru Sahib is at Sabo Ki Talwandi. Prayer meetings are being held there. People are flocking there, in thousands. There are festivities all over. O'my Waheguru, I thank you from the bottom.. of my heart, you have fulfilled my wishes. Premo, pack every quickly. We must all leave immediately! Bhai Sukha ji, may God bless you! I don't know how to thank you for bringing this good news! You've given me a new lease of life! Sukha Singh here has been telling me... About my four sons...right, Sukha Singhji? They...all four of them.... All four of them... they're there If they're also at that place, then what are we waiting for? Hurry Let's go! I wish I could hug all four of them right now! I can feel the warmth of my Children, as if I am hugging them... I cant wait to meet my sons. Hurry! We should leave for Talwandi now. The mother was leaving with a lot of excitement.... Tell me... how can I tell her the news you've brought us? Oh, my Guru Sahib. I don't have the courage to tell the.. mother of your children this terrible news... Guru Sahib please forgive us Guru Sahib, you will have to do this yourself, now... The mother had left with a lot of excitement.. That soon she will be with her sons Her desires fulfilled when she will hug them tight.. What are you thinking? With her husband there too before her.... The mother had left with a lot of excitement.. That soon she will be with her sons Bhai Mani Singhji How long to Talwandi..? Almost there about to reach. As we reach, please can you get lots of churri made for my Sahibzaade. They absolutely adore it! Why don't you ask a volunteer right away. Yes, Mataji, I'll do it now! Fakir Singh! Get lots of churri cooked and bring it to the Darbaar.! I will kiss the younger ones as play with them And hug the elder ones tightly Hug them tightly... I'll keep them close to my heart for my contentment I'll keep them close to my heart for my contentment They are the light of my life She sees the gathering of people with Guru Sahib sitting there The mother had left with a lot of excitement That soon she will be with her sons Guru Sahib said, 'Please get up now... Togetherness and separation, are the truth of life. We must accept all that God does, for he does it in our best interests... We were destined by God to meet again, and I am thankful to him for that.' I can't see any of my four sons here. Nor our dear mother. Guru Sahib said. 'But I can see Mataji and my children.' Where are they? Guru Sahib continued, 'There I can see my mother And there are my sons.' I'm asking about our children. Guru Sahib said, 'I am not pointing at strangers.' But...I am talking about Mataji and the Four Sahibzaade. Guru Sahib said, 'For these sons of mine, I have sacrificed my four sons. So what if those four are no more, there are thousands of sons here alive.' The mother stood motionless When the truth dawned on her. As if someone had plucked her heart out The mother tried to compose herself But there was darkness all over without her sons Fate separated them and then they never met again The Four Princes Guru sahib then said, 'Bhai Daya Singh Please tell this mother that she has every right to cry at the martyrdom of her sons. But alongside that of her four sons.. She must add the sacrifice of thousands of others.. who have been martyred every time I've asked them to fight for a cause. Every time the gates of the Mud Fort in Chamkaur opened, five Singhs went out and died fighting. So what if one of them was my son too? Should I grieve the loss of my son and not the other four? Never! I've never treated my Khalsa unfairly and never will do!' Mataji. Churri is ready I asked for churri for my four sons But you have given me hundreds of sons. Go and give it to them all. The mother was as if blessed Seen astonished scenario She saw her sons in the hundreds gathered there. Gobind's Four Sons As if there was no differentiation between her sons and the disciples there Her sons were serving and eating the churri too The lord had blessed her with thousands of sons The four Princes...Thousand Princes... The Four Princes... Bhai Daya Singhji, now that I too am Singh.. I am sure Guru Sahib will take along with you all to Sirhind.. Once we are there, we will make the Mughals pay for everything Every dishonor, every pain that they have caused the Sahibzaade! We must leave for Punjab! Wazir khan is the kind, who will surely be upto something... You have sent two assassins to kill the Guru?! I have my doubts that after killing innocent children and with this... New habit of back stabbing you may not able to fight like a warrior anymore! God forbid what will happen if you have to face the Guru in a Battle? There will be a battle with the Guru only if is able to survive! The elder Begum kept convincing you to.. leave the Guru alone, till she breathed her last. I don't care for my life either, stop this murder! I cant do anything now, the assassins are on their mission, waiting for the right time to strike! Yes Guruji, we will check for you now Have you put it in tent?? Lets go and see You wait here outside on guard, while I do the job and come. Move fast... fast Did you hear that? What's up with the horses so late at night? Come on! Lets go check... Catch him! Him and his men have attacked Guru Sahib!!! Isn't he one of those two Pathans? Yes! He is the same It is him! Who are you, where are you from? W-W-Wa-Wazir Khan sent us here...Wazir Khan... The wound of Guru Sahib was quite big, the bleeding had stopped. But it was difficult for the Hakim to judge the depth of the wound. The Singhs brought an English doctor from the camp of Emperor.. Bahadur Shah which was nearby on the banks of the River Godavari. He assured the wound will heal, and Guru Sahib would have to rest for at least 6 months. But, even a minute slip in care could be fatal. Banda Singh...! I told you, didn't I? That he would be upto something! Wazir khan! You wicked Wazir Khan...!! The messenger had got the news that Guru Sahib's letters had been very well-received. People were eagerly waiting for him to come to Punjab. But Guru Sahib's wound was not letting him ride a horse. So He decided to choose someone else to lead the.. Sikhs with the consent of The Chosen Five . The man I've chosen to lead you all in our fight in Punjab is Banda Singh Bahadur. Guru Sahib said, 'As a token of my faith in him I would like to give him a few things. These are the five arrows from my quiver. This is the Naggara - the war drum of the Sikhs and This the nishan sahib - symbol of the Khalsa. Now, I will tell you in which form I will be with you... Guru Sahib then called for Bhai Binod Singh, Bhai Kahan Singh, Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Baaj Singh, Bhai Ram Singh, to come forward... They are the Chosen Five. They are the Khalsa. The Panth. They represent me. What ever you do should be with their consent.. You will never disagree with them As you wish Guru Sahib. Guru Sahib told them, 'You must give Banda Singh your complete Loyalty and support. When you think Banda Singh does something That does not conform with my teachings, you have to show him the right path There is no time to lose. I have handpicked another Twenty-five men to accompany you. You must be cautious and avoid any confrontation.. with the Mughals during your journey. Take a longer route if necessary. You will travel separately in groups of five.. Burria is the first destination where you will all meet next Banda Singh... You are now the leader. If you feel it necessary to go into battle immediately.. then you must do so, don't wait for me. Any questions? You must make an early start tomorrow, for your journey to Punjab.' You look absolutely like a pathan Yes no one will recognize me! Yes, We cannot be spotted by the Mughals Guru Sahib said, 'I knew you would come. Any questions...' Yes, there so many Singhs who have been with you since long.. Why then did you choose me? Guru sahib said, 'There is Honesty in your question Banda Singh. I was looking for a warrior For a long time, that is why I came and took charge of the cot in your ashram.' Guruji, I can assure You, I will do my best to lead... In the battlefield, until you come to take charge. Guru Sahib said, 'And what if I don't come?' It is you, who have taught us, That whatever happens is by God's Will. And I will accept His Will As your command Guru Sahib asked, 'You will miss me, wont you?' No. I am only leading the Contingent It is you who is the General of the Sikh Army. I know your spirit as soul will always be with us Singhs. Guru sahib said, 'You are indeed ready, Banda Singh. Come, let us pray before you leave...' Banda left with Guru's blessings... He left saying I am your disciple' Whoever utters this shall be happy, shall be fulfilled, 'Truth is the ultimate God' Banda left with Guru's blessings He left saying 'I am your disciple' He will shower kindness Shatter the tyrants like lightening Banda's......Banda's..... Sword will strike like Thunder! Sword will strike like Thunder! Sword will strike like Thunder! The wound of Guru Sahib, looked fine on the outside But Hakim had informed them, it was spreading poison within The Singhs were very concerned on hearing this. Guru Sahib, called them inside and told them... There was nothing to worry about Whatever God Will's, one must accept. Guru Sahib, then asked Bhai Daya Singh to gather everyone before the Holy Book of The Granth Sahib. He had a long-awaited ritual to perform. Guru Sahib announced, 'Khalsaji, Today I am revealing a decision that I made a while ago. On Baisakhi day, when The Five Chosen ones were baptized I have bowed, I have made an offering of five paisas before the Guru Granth Sahib From this day forth, This Holy Book will be your and my next Guru. From now on, no one in flesh and blood will ever be our Guru. Our spirit will always be within Shri Guru Granth Sahib. You shall pray in its presence. Always practice the principles of the Khalsa... Under orders of the Immortal Being, the Panth was created And now to the whole gathering, I say glory be to God. Waheguruji ka Khalsa Waheguruji ki Fateh Hail the God to whom belongs the Victory! (chorus) Banda singhji.... We will not strike first, but if they do, we will wipe them right out! Hold on! Where are you heading? To our homes... Check their belongings I will not let you search Really? I'll have to set you right then..come on! Never challenge a man who is travelling for a good cause! Guys..run!. Guys..run!,. We are going to come across a lot of these blockages, any plans? When He is with us, why the worry? He entrusted us with everything, when we became His disciples. After declaring the Guru Granth Sahib as the next Guru, the day Guru Sahib asked his disciples to assemble again. The morning of that day was mystifying... the birds did not chirp.. the call of the peacocks were not heard, the deers were quiet... They were all looking with saddened eyes at tent of the Guru... Guru Sahib told them, 'Khalsaji, this is our last meeting.' Last meeting? (crowd murmuring) I am getting messages from Waheguru through the state of my wound, I will breathing my last very soon now.. Don't say that Guruji, please don't My Lord, do you think it is fair for you to leave us? Guru Sahib explained them, 'The number of days the Lord meant us to be here are over. It's time to leave this world. People who worship the Lord are free from the cycle life and death. The earlier Guru's have not gone away from you, neither will I... I will surrender my physical self and immerse in the space of my Lord. But whosoever will need me, I will always be there for you Allow me to leave, May you all be blessed by the Lord. Truth is His Name. From now you will always chant The name of The Lord Practice the principles of The Khalsa Ah yes.... There us enough space for you three, go on into last room on your right... What about the Sikhs? I'll tell you about the Sikhs later, I hear that Emperor Bahadur Shah has left the banks of River Godavari and moved onto Delhi. Seems the uprising in the South has subsided. What about the Sikhs? I believe the Sikhs at Nanded too will move back to Punjab as well Why? Sad news... Their tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh has passed away I heard he was unwell? No. Because he was stabbed in the chest. The poison has spread throughout his body... And what if I don't come? It is you who has taught us, That whatever happens, happens with the Will of God His will is your command I accept His will. Congratulations! My happiness has no bounds! The excitement on hearing the news Of the death of Gobind is far greater than even if I was offered the throne in Delhi! This is the end of the breed of Sikhs... C'mon...! Celebrate! It seems like we have lost everything... After the death of a father, the son is tied a turban. A sign of taking over the responsibility of his family. That is why Guru Sahib has made us all tie turbans. It is now the responsibility of every one of us to make His dreams come true... What are you saying? Nothing has happened to my Guru... He worries enormously about his Sikhs... He must have deiced to go for a solitary walk by the River Godavri... Brother Daya Singhji, go and find him...you must go Just like how you found him in the Machiwara forest last time... You found him then... You will find him now... I beg you...go now Brother Daya Singhji, go find him now We can't live without him...go! Send someone to the River Godavari, to ask after him, please... Mataji We must ask everyone someone.. ask.. Yes I will ask, I will ask them all But as soon as I meet Mata Gujriji, I will ask her The one who gave birth to such a unique son... I will ask her... O'Mother Gujri, the angelic one, Tell us whether you were aware That there will be, No other like your Son Nor a Mother like you Tell us whether you were aware, That He would send his Father to martyr in Delhi There is no other like your Son... For people who apply a Tilak and wear the sacred thread.. He will forgo his own Father-the Protector, for their sake Tell us whether you were aware.. O' tell us mother, were you aware... Guru Sahib had told us, to re-group here at Burria, after we left Nanded. But we did not know then, we will be sharing this sad news He had Five Sons The Fifth being The Khalsa(Singhs) Khalsa is a legendary conception Even though he sacrificed his Four Sons His legacy will live on in the Khalsa O' tell us mother were you aware... O' tell us mother were you aware... O' tell us mother were you aware... I knew my Son was God's child He was destined to lift the plight of the Countrymen... God's own men are always composed and never talk of incidents yet to happen.. I was aware of everything... Yes, I knew it all... Yes, I knew it all. The Five Chosen Ones have now decided, that we must not turn back It is now our task to make the Guru's dream come true Wipe up all your tears and let us rattle the enemy! Power to us! What's happened? Why have you woken up with a shock? This is not a letter you hold, But the first step towards our freedom. Each one who reads it, blood will run high through his veins! Go deliver them all over Punjab. Punjab is not far I expect a lot many to join us as they get these letters.. But we are short on funds and rations. How will take care of them? When in trouble and when you have no options left, just pray to Waheguru... Have faith in Waheguru and Nanak says, 'He will take care of your needs' We're now safely past Delhi, and well equipped for the next stage of our journey... Hey what's with him? Banda Singh there is group of men approaching the camp. They seem to be villagers... Run...! They're Dacoits! What...? Why are they fleeing? Oh! Please stop... Don't kill me! We have all, left our homes unlocked. Go take what you want... don't kill me...I beg you! We are not Dacoits... Check, I have nothing on me, go loot our village...please Who is looting you? The blood thirsty Daciot. Randhir Sian. You are his men, right? No no, we are no Dacoits. Relax. We will save you from them What? How? He's going to loot our village tonight. Do not fear... Binod Singhji, this will be the first step of our fight against terror in Punjab and Dacoit Randhir Sian's very last! The Guru has sent Banda who is a saint and a soldier.. There lit hope in the eyes of the common man... The village is empty. Go loot all houses and burn the one where you find nothing! This town belongs to us Randhir Sian! Who are you? Even the birds fly out of their nests when they hear of me coming. Now on empty villages like these will be full of life again You are trying to confront me, who has the protection of the Mughal rulers? How dare you? Who are you to confront me, Randhir Sian? The friend of the weak, for whom all are the same Taking his blessings, I have come here in Grace Banda Singh Bahadur is my Name! Singh's never attack an unarmed man..Here! Take this We are thankful to you! You have freed us from the terror of the Dacoits! Don't be so jubilant! The real dacoit is not dead. The real dacoits are the Mughals! If you want real freedom... then you will have to fight for your own self! We are with you!(chorus) Here comes the messiah Who will rid people of their pain... The Guru has gone but has left behind this problematic man. He will win them over with love.. Trust in him will make their hearts beat in peace.... Banda's sword will strike like thunder... My Lord, Banda Singh has looted our convoy of treasure, on its way here! Banda's sword will strike like thunder... We were just waiting for this. Banda freed many villages and estates from the clutches of terror. Wazir Khan's grasp on Punjab had begun to crack. Tell me, Aali and Maali Singh I hear another Guru of your Sikhs, has risen from somewhere? By conquering small estates adjacent to Delhi on the out skirts of Punjab, Does he really believe he can challenge Sirhind? Why do all these Sikhs choose our Sirhind to come and die?! I suggest you both go talk to him, and ask him to face me, the Governor of Sirhind in battle..! I'll butcher him a manner, no one has ever seen in this world. I pushed your Guru towards the South, where he finally died. And I will kill Banda I'll crush his bones and spread the dust all over Sirhind, so no other dare challenge me! Stop! Not another word Wazir Khan I will not hear another word against The Guru or against His noble leader How dare you? Try and remember... What Guru Sahib's younger sons told you standing right here in this court? When you asked His Son's what both of them would do if you agreed to free them... Let me first ask them, what will they do if I freed them? We will do exactly what our Guru Father is doing. And what all the Sikh Generations to come will do. Fight till the last, against oppression and injustice. How will you...? We will go out and gather all our Guru Father's Singhs, and create an Army. And that's what is happening now! You killed the innocent boys, but what they said is surely coming true. The Singh's of the Guru, are getting together now The war against injustice has begun again, and very soon Banda Singh Bahadur will have his hands wrapped around your neck! You dare threaten me? Put these two in the dungeon and prepare them for a painful death! Your death is soon Wazir Khan! Leave me.... There will be no escaping it! Huh...Banda Bahadur... We are expecting some people from Kaithal.. Khalsaji, some of the messengers we sent to Punjab, have returned. And with some news for you... Yes, yes! Let them in... Khalsaji... I have just come from Samana... Samana looks like a flourishing City from the outside but the reality is quite different. Trying to run away from Samana without repaying my debt? For Generations we have been paying your debt. We have no more money. Have mercy on me, my wife and my child. Free me from your debt... Free him from my debt Kill him! And hang him upside down This is Samana! No one leaves here without paying me What was the debt of the poor man? There is no such debt, they make the farmer work, then pay him just enough for a meal a day. When dying of hunger he asks for more... They give him his due but only as a loan...with incredible interest. So that for the rest of his life, he is forever in their debt These farmers will be poor forever. Imagine, if the last rites of the dead are not performed as per their religion. How painful can it be for the families... This is the state of the people of Shadora... How long...? How long will you torture us? How long will we have to bury our dead? Officer, please let me cremate my father as my tradition requires us. You dared to break the law Of Sedora, and you will pay! Father.... Punish this man to death, and bury them both I am ashamed and in a state of shock of what I saw in Kapoori What is it that happens there? Whichever religion the newly-wed bride is from It must be Kadar-uldin who spends the first night with her! Get-off now! Take her away. To her husband (grunts) The people of Kapoori have accepted this as their way of life, such is the terror of that man. More have arrived, Kaithal - Enough! The state of Punjab is becoming worse than hell! Madho Das...Which is that mantra you recite.. which does not alert your mind to notice such a carnage? Take my advice, start your journey again. On your way, you will find hardworking poor farmers crying for help... Go, wipe their tears... God is waiting for you, to make them smile again... We are camped here now, our motive is to reach Sirhind. But before we can reach there, we need to conquer Samana. But Samana is defended by huge numbers. True. I am sure that as our messages have been delivered, we will have thousands and thousands of men joining us soon. We need funds to conquer Samana The Amirs, Estate owners, and Officers of Kaithal and Sonepat have hoarded their money and the loot of locals in the government treasuries. That is my next target. What do you have to say to this? Lets Go!! Banda Singh then looted the treasuries of Kaithal and Sonipat. Soon the Bairaggi Singhs and Bhai Fateh Singh joined him with their forces. Why are we wasting time talking about these damn Singhs!? Yet you've called us here to Samana to discuss rumors about them? He became stronger by the day. Then turned his Army towards Samana Banda Singh attacked Samana. When the suppressed locals heard the Singhs, they gathered courage too. They picked up what ever weapons they could and attacked the Amirs... Soon, Samana was conquered and locals freed from bondage. Banda, take what you want? Money... gold...leave me....give me freedom... Give him freedom! Hang him upside down in the market square. The executioners who buried the younger sons of the Guru in the wall, were in Samana too Banda comes. - Banda comes Have mercy on us! It was Wazir Khan and his officer who planned it all. It wasn't our fault! No, no! Don't blame anyone else. You were given a choice... Everyone else in Sirhind refused to do the job. For your freedom, you chose to choke and kill two innocent children by burying them alive in a wall! I will show you, how it feels to die of suffocation. We made a mistake! So much destruction. So much blood shed. I feel I've let you down... This is not what you asked me to do, with your beloved Punjab.... Guru Sahib, have I made a mistake again, when I killed the two fawns? Guru Sahib said, 'No, Banda Singh. You have done nothing of that kind.' My Lord...My Guru... Who else could know the state of my mind better than you... Forgive me... Guru Sahib explained, 'No. It's the local farmers and workers, tormented for years who caused this vengeful destruction.' But Guruji, I should have explained your message of forgiveness And I should have stopped them. 'In the rage of battle, reason cannot prevail. If you had tried to stop them, they would have turned their anger upon you! Don't feel guilty. It is the guilty, who have been punished. Whatever happens here, is by His Will alone. Accept it as the Will of Waheguru. When the True Guru is merciful, You will know no pain When the True Guru is merciful, You will enjoy the Lord's Love Banda Singh distributed a good part of the looted treasure amongst the residents of Samana. My grandmother had a necklace just like this one. Hold on! It is this one Aaah, it is this one! Look at this treasure All the efforts of Banda Singh, have freed us from debt forever. How much land, do each of you farmers have? 1600 yds 3200 yds I acre {4000 yds} 1600 yds 3200 yds But we don't own the land. We just till it. From today onwards, this land is yours. Really...? Can this be true? Am I dreaming...? I can't believe this.. Brother Fateh Singhji, from now on, they own the land. You are now the administrator of Samana Transfer the farmers name, on the land he tills. The Landlord system now stands abolished! My Lord, Samana has fallen to Banda Bahadur! I have news that huge contingents of Sikhs from the Malwa, Majha and Doaba regions are heading to join Banda's army right now! No! I will not let this happen! I will not let a child cross over to join him, from this side of Sirhind. And you talk of a contingent? Every tongue that takes his name, I want you to cut it out! If a foot takes a step towards him! I want you to chop it off! It's an order!! Banda was able to asses Wazir Khan's next move. He changed the course of his army's advance towards the banks of River Satluj. Where the Nawab of Malerkotla had locked the Sikhs of Majha and Doaba in a battle. His victory march did not stop. He conquered Gurm, Kesar, Shahbad.. and Mustafabad on his way there. He then freed Kapoori, from the clutches of Kadar-ul-din. Locals spat and threw stones at this notorious rapist with rage in their eyes. Banda then turned to attack Sadora. Osman Khan, the Lord of Sadora had killed Saint Buddhu Shah because he had helped Guru Gobind Singh in the battle of Bhangani. Osman was killed. The people Of Sadora got freedom Locals dug out their dead, and cremated their loved ones, Thanking Guru Gobind Singh for sending a messiah Wazir Khan needs to start counting his last days... Because believe me, he hasn't got many left! Our people who are coming from Doaba and Majha are waiting the day of their vengeance, when Wazir Khan will be beheaded!! Yes, we will only be at peace, after we avenge the martyrdom of the Guru's sons. We certainly gave a suitable reply to the Nawab of Malerkotla and conquered Banur and Ropar with ease. Friends, I appreciate your emotions But there is one thing, I want to make clear to you all. My Guru has not sent me here, to avenge the death of his youngest sons. Not at all. My Guru Sahib was above all that. Taking to the sword, as a last resort. He never had vengeance on his mind, for any deed he did. If he had, he would not have helped Bahadur Shah to claim his throne, knowing he was the son of Aurangzeb... His bitterest enemy and the murderer of his beloved father. Nor was he against any religion. We have soldiers among us, from all religions. He has sent me to free Punjab from the tyranny of the Mughals, and to create the Punjab of His and our dreams. Yes, in the execution of such a duty we will, ofcourse punish the wrong doers... Whether he is a Wazir Khan or someone else.. I know... Wazir Khan is a cruel man and a devil. There is no place for a man like this in Punjab. He will be punished. How can I ever forget the Cold Tower (Burj)? Begum, you come here quite often. What worries you, my love? The massacre that occurred in Sadora or the defeat the Nawab of Malerkotla suffered at the Sutlej? Nothing like that will happen here in Sirhind. No war has been lost by the Mughal Army in the last hundred years. And I will win this one also And Banda Singh, I will kill him. In a way, that the world will remember it for centuries to come! Why can't you hear the omen coming from Cold Tower, my dear husband? We were just 31 of us, when we left Nanded. With Guru Sahib's blessings, our count is now in thousands We shall attack Sirhind in the summer I am sure by then we will have all our soldiers battle-ready! Mothers have sent their sons, sisters their brothers and wives their husbands, with a smile on their faces, For the freedom of our people. Guru Sahib, I will never let them down. I will never be able to forget their unconditional support. As time changed I realized the ways of my Lord The meek stood Up to defend himself And the weak Defeated the tormentors Great! Banda has infused so much courage among the common people, everywhere That he now has an enormous following And they are all ready to die for him. You are absolutely right, Baba BulleShah. Just as your writings make people aware how to pray to the Almighty, Banda's velour attracts people to join him to fight this terrible injustice. Only a noble soul, can understand and feel the real pain of the poor tormented starved man... You were saying something, and you stopped I will. I can never hold back my thoughts... There are terrible times ahead for those, who dare live against the Will of God... I will say what comes to my mind, If I will say what come to my mind, If I tell a lie, It is accepted When I speak the truth, There is chaos! I go trapped in both ways But still my heart says, I will say what comes to my mind.. What news does your nephew bring? Tell him! Ganda Mal Sir, I have joined Banda's army without them knowing Banda Singh is making tremendous preparations for the Battle. Let him do what ever he can! Emperors have changed in Delhi, But, here in Sirhind, Wazir Khan rules, Correct? And shall always rule! Where have come from, and where will go? Tell me your destination The position and estate your ego boasts of... Nothing will go with you to the next world... You torture people with your wicked ways You will be punished for your deeds Have you thought of the punishment to Banda after the victory, Khan Sahib? I will cut him into 40 pieces, and hang his head on my Fort as an exhibit for my people! Be very careful of his head Sire, these Sikhs whisked away the head of their Ninth Guru from Chandni Chowk This is Sirhind, not Delhi. (laughter) Somewhere you are a Thief, Somehwere a Priest Somewhere you stand, On a high platform and preach Sometimes you are Tegh, Bahadur the defiant Saint Who offered his head for others O' tell me in who, And where all do O' tell me in who and where all, Do you disguise yourself my Lord Wait at Chapparchiri, Supplies from Banur Manimajra and Kharar, must be blocked from reaching Wazir Khan's Fort forces, at all cost. Banda singh look at my army, my cannons. Come, see the strength of my force...come! Fantastic! Wow! I can see the cannon balls cutting right through the Sikh forces. I can visualize their body parts flung all over. Most will perish and the rest will panic and flee to the safety of their Mother's arms Victory will be ours!! 15,000 trained men... 1,200 Horsemen, dozens of elephants, 5,000 ferocious Ghazis, and many canons Am I correct? Wazir Khan is planning a warm welcome for us! Banda Singhji, how will we face his cannons? I just need to know the range of the cannons. Will they reach from here to here... Banda Singhji, the men who were on their way to bring reinforcements to our Army, Wazir Khan's men arrested them and hanged them to death in the village squares All this to scare away, all those who might have joined us. Where did you get this news from? We heard the new recruits discussing it, in the camp. Tell me, how did you feel when you heard this cruel deed of Wazir Khan? My blood boils, Sire! But Singhji, I am worried about the mental state of the new men. Don't you worry! This cruel deed of Wazir Khan, Will infuse fury into our soldiers Now, make sure you are fully geared up! The tyrants have done this terrible deed to scare my men... O'tell me Guru Sahib, is this the right time to attack Sirhind? Khalsa ji... Nothing will happen, if just keep thinking... You are aware that this is the Will of our Guru Father, then why are you hesitating? The right time to attack is when you think you are ready. And when you are ready, all Singh's are ready Just think Khalsaji, isn't this cowardly act a sign of his nervousness... He is very scared of you, From deep within within.. Move ahead Singhji .... Yes, we are with you! (Waheguru) Hail the Lord! (Waheguru) Hail the Lord! (Waheguru) Hail the Lord! Khalsaji, a man and a woman have come to meet you from Sirhind. They came here a number of times before They insist on meeting you before you go to battle, Sir. Yes, tell me.... I am Noora Mahi. I visited Sirhind on Guru Sahib's instructions... Yes, yes, Bhai Daya Singh mentioned that to me in passing. This is my sister, Razia. She saw the martyrdom of the younger sons of Guru Sahib, brick by brick I have brought something for you. This is one of the bricks, that was used in the wall that day I have kept it with me for five long years now... This is for you... Keep it with you in the battle. I believe it will inspire you to teach Wazir Khan the lesson he truly needs to learn We are all with you... Don't cry my dear... I don't know how to thank Guru Sahib, for sending you here to me, this day I would like to hear all that you witnessed in Sirhind that day... Guru Sahib. You have sent me to free Punjab from its cruel ruler, and not to seek revenge. But when I'm in battle, with the account of brutality I've just heard in my mind. I have a request to make, that when the tyrant Wazir Khan is before me in the attlefield, that you please forgive me... Banda Singh, this is not Samana nor Sadaura. It is my Sirhind, Wazir Khan's Sirhind. Wazir khan, I am neither your Officer nor a King of a Hill State I am a Singh, my Guru's Singh! I give you a choice, drop your arms now. Beg me and I'll spare the lives of you and your men.... You could not win over two young children, aged five and nine! How do imagine winning over thousands of us determined Sikhs? Come! Kneel before me. Why do you want to die, of this day. Don't you even think of kneeling before me! I am not sparing you. Soon, your forces will be in my custody. Come on! Try and get us.... Just look at my cannons... Look at my Singhs! Each one is like a cannon ball! Banda Singh, this is the last chance for you! Wazir khan, if you have a last wish, wish now! You will not see the sun rise tomorrow! The sun will set today only when you are dead and gone! Soldiers, of the most efficient army of the world! Crush the enemy in such a way, that their coming generations die from our fear in their wombs. This Wazir Khan commands! Khalsaji pounce on the enemy as if you are possessed, you are the army of Waheguru! We shall get justice for the sins committed in Sirhind! Generations to come, will feel honoured and proud! Every time they will read The History of this day... Who is the Commander today? Our Guru Gobind Singhji Oh Lord...! In performing righteous action I may never falter May I never be intimated When I fight with the enemies I know in my heart! I will be victorious! I know in my heart! I will be victorious!! I know in my heart! I will be victorious!!!!! Glory to God! Glory to god Untrained idiots! Charge!!! Move Forward... Stop! Any further, we will be in range of the cannon fire! Charge! Faster! Before they reload their cannons, we must reach them!! Shoot arrows! Cannons reloaded... Bad news! All our routes of supplies from our Forts at Banur, Manimajra and Kharar have been cut-off by the Sikhs. There are no more supplies or help coming in! It is he, who will need help today. See how my spies in his army, turn the Battle in my favor! Suchanand! The Mughals are crushing Sikhs... Go! Run for your lives now! Oh...What is he saying?? It will soon be over! Banda Singhji, the cannons have been devastating The newly joined contingents are retreating now Singhji, rally the reserve forces. Command them to strike back against this treachery! Onwards! In this battlefield, The Singh's who have come Are ready to sacrifice Themselves for their Guru's sake They come to fight, to kill or maybe die The beats of the war drum Spell victory! Banda's... Banda's sword will strike like thunder! Take this! You committed a blunder, giving me a sword back... If it was me, I would have cut your arms to pieces! Come then! I am unarmed, Strike me down!! Nanak says bad deeds, lead to a bad end Wazir Khan! The time has come for tyrants like you to get what they deserve So lie and eat dust! You must be wondering, why I haven't ended your miserable life! Look here! This is a brick from the wall in which you buried our Guru's sons and martyred them. This brick is five years old... Baba Fateh Singh was also just five years of age. With this brick I will give you nine fatal blows! Because Baba Zorawar Singh was nine! Get ready to pay for your sins! For every innocent you have killed, You devil! Wazir Khan!! Today you will be defeated by this Fateh Singh too! (Sikh Army roars) The tryant is dead but his shadows loom large. March to Sirhind! Kazi Sahib! Kazi Sahib! Kazi Sahib! Open the door.. Suchanand!, What news? We are defeated. Wazir Khan is dead. Leave for Delhi, with your family right now! That is Suchanand! Stop him! Catch him ! Stop Sucha Nand! Let him not get away! Suchanand, today there is no escape! Please don't hit me! Please don't! Suchanand ... Forgive me Banda Singh Jiiiii... I made a terrible mistake! Remember, what you said about my Guru Sahib, as you stood right here? Did you hear? A snake's child will be as poisonous as the snake himself... I said it with this very tongue. Here cut it out... but don't kill me.. Remember now what Baba Zorawar Singh said to you that day? Sucha Nand, hold your tongue! My father is a friend of the weak, known for his good deeds. Bow downing respect to Him... Guru Gobind Singh is his name! Here, I bow down, I bow down, bow down, I bow to Guru Sahib, I bow to you for the rest of my life... Just please... forgive me... Look up. Clever one! Tell me in your own words... What was Baba Fateh Singh's warning to you, that day? Thank your Thank your lucky stars, we are your prisoners Otherwise I swear by the Almighty, your head would no longer, be on your shoulders Forgive me. Confine me in the cold tower for life... But, please please don't kill me... Be grateful that Baba Fateh Singh prophesied an easy death for you, that day... I will have to do what those two innocent prophesied! Apology.. Ehh Banda Singhji,.. We have taken Wazir Khan's wife and children in our custody. And we await your orders. Wherever they want to go, take them. Offering your full respect and give protection.
