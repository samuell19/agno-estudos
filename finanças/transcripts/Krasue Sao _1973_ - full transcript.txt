Help! Help! What is it? What's going on? A vampire! - What? A vampire? - Yes it's eating all of my chickens. Alright, let's go look, come on! A vampire, huh? - Where is it? - Over there. Here. Where is it? There's nothing here. It's gone. It's killed several of our chickens. It came close to killing me too. It looked scary. We'll have to kill it as soon as possible. Yes we do. Hey, there it is! Get it! Don't let it get away! - Strange, it vanished. - Where is it? Where could it have gone? Here it is! Grandma, are you alright? Is anything wrong? Grandma! Are you ok? Somebody attacked me. Who? I didn't see his face. How did he get in here? Through the window. Through the window? Quiet, don't say anything Bua Klee, just listen to me! I don't have much time left... I'm poor and have grown old under hard circumstances. The only thing I own is this ring. I'm very fond of it. Take it, I want you to have it. - But grandma- - Don't argue with me If you love me then take it, but you have to wear it for the rest of your life. Promise me that you'll never take it off. Yes grandma Ghost of Guts Eater Swedish subtitle translation by BingoDays What weather we're having! We should have stayed in bed. So what got you up so early in the morning? I had a nightmare about Bua Klee. Why? Do you miss her? You poor lovesick guy. What a fantasy dream! Better than to dream of a fool like you. Hey now, what's this? I could get a better looking girl than your Bua Klee! I'd like to see it! - Why's it so quiet? - I don't know, maybe everyone's still asleep. Bua Klee isn't as lazy as you are. I wouldn't mind a little nap. Bua Klee! Boon Muang... My grandmother, my grandmother is dead. You poor thing. Somebody attacked her. Who was it? I don't know, she didn't see his face. He came through the window while she slept. What do we do now? She asked me to burn her remains. Not to bury her, or tell anyone about it either. Strange, why would she want that? I haven't the faintest idea, She just made me promise before she died. You shouldn't have done that. You frightened me. Oh did I? Then I'll comfort you. No, there's no need for that... I just heard about your grandmother. Why didn't you let me know? What happened? There's nothing to tell. You must be all alone now Bua Klee. I'll stay with you, if you'd like me to. Thanks, but I'll be alright. But I'd like to do it, so what do you say? Don't touch me, keep away from me! That poor fool wants to marry you. Leave me alone! Let me go! No! Help! Goddamned fool! Try it, and you'll see! Meanwhile, in the Old West... I wouldn't have believed Chatr could do that. It's because he knew you were all by yourself I'm so very frightened. What will I do if he comes back? Don't worry! I'll protect you. The bastard hit me. Who did? Muang. So why did he do that? Didn't you know about him and Bua Klee? Oh, I see... So that's why I saw him and Chood in her house. What are you going to do? - Well... - If you really do love her... then get rid of him and just take her. I feel tranquil and at peace whenever I visit this temple. I'm thinking of joining a monastery next year. I wish I had been born a man, I'd be a monk and hold mass for grandma. But we just held the 100th day mass a bit ago. Yes, and what I prayed for was that... my grandmother would always be looking over me. Bua Klee, Bua Klee, my niece. It's been a 100 days now and I'm feeling hungry, so very hungry Come, let's get something to eat. Bua Klee, wake up! Do you hear me? I'm so very hungry. Come Bua Klee! You must come with me. You must! Do you hear? Come now, you must... What is it? Chood! Hurry up! What is it? Open the door! Hurry! Open the door quickly! - What's this about? - Come on! What is it? What do you see? What do I see? What do you think I see? That your wife is sleeping? Yes... No... See what then? What is it Muang? Has something happened Chood? It's just... just that... You had a nightmare Muang. Don't eat so much before bed next time. Or I'll have to get up in the middle of the night again. Did you really have a nightmare? Either that, or an hallucination. What was it? No, it's nothing. Dreaming again? Yes, I think so. I just missed her by an inch. I ran after it, but then I lost her. Where do you think it could have run off to? Any idea? It's not the same one I saw last time, This one is younger... and I know who she is. Who is she? It's Bua Klee. I guess I was lucky I didn't marry her. Yeah, it probably would have been worse, you would've been sucked dry. Here's her husband. Can I help you? My wife wants noodle soup. She's having a baby. That's a surprise. Can a vampire get knocked up? Guess they're like other women. Seems so. Pregnant vampires likes noodle soup. Hey Chatr, what do you mean by that? It's your wife, Muang. You should get rid of her Everyone in town has seen it. Bua Klee is a vampire. If you don't shut your mouth I'll shut it for you. I'm telling you because I want what's best for you. Do you want a witness? I don't give a damn whether or not she's a vampire If you don't believe me... ask Cheng, he knows. Enough talk already! Chood! Are you ok..? You've killed him. Let's get out of here! Hurry! Hey Chood, wake up! I'm not dead yet. It's just a scratch... but it hurts like hell! Fucking idiot! Have something to drink. How is Chood doing today? Much better. He can already walk around for a while. He says he's earned himself some rest. Any news about Cheng? Nothing. He probably still thinks he killed Chood. I bet he's long gone. I'm the cause of all the problems that have happened, if it wasn't for me everything would be alright You can't help it. It's not your fault. - Don't blame yourself. - Muang? Muang! Dr. Prasit wants to see you. What is it about? I don't know... just that he wants to see you. I'll be right there Strange. Why would he ask for you? It must be something important. I should go and see Is that you? Come in! Good day, doctor! You asked to see me? That's right. What about? The villagers have asked for my help. It's about the vampire. What has that have to do with me? A lot. The vampire is your wife. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Who's been saying this? I did. Your wife is the vampire. You're lying! I'm not! I've seen it with my own eyes. You bastard! Stop! Show some respect in my house! Did he show me any respect? He's not the only one who claims this. Everyone says the same thing. Ask them yourself! Alright, Alright! Quiet. I've done my own investigation. Cheng saw her get in the house and take the baby's placenta. Cheng wasn't the only one, his wife saw it too. I threw my spear after her, but missed. She got away! Bullshit! Perhaps not. I've spoken with a demon... and he said the same thing. I don't believe any of it. I know your wife is pregnant... and that she's not feeling well. You should listen to everyone's opinion. My opinion and that of the neighbors should be heard, why don't you think about it? I've listened to you, but I can't believe it. You can't believe it because you haven't seen it yourself... so you need some kind of proof. What do you mean? The demon has to come out of her! Hey, give me that cane, the one over there! This is a holy cane. Strike her with it. You want me to strike my own wife? Yes, you have to. It won't hurt her. It's the demon inside her that will suffer. If you can't bring yourself to do it... there's another option, I have a different method. But I'm afraid that it will kill your wife. Do you want her to die? Take this, and find out the truth. Take it! Take it and do it right away. It's the only way. Why did you do that? I have to beat the truth out of you It hurts so much. Stop! What have I done to deserve this, for you to treat me this way? You already know why. What should I know? This! Hey, what's this, what are you doing? You idiot! Why are you hitting her? Damned barbarian! Is this how a husband treats his wife? Bastard! A man like you? It's more than shameful. You know as well as I do that she's with child... and that it's your own flesh and blood. Go on! Hit her again why don't you! Go on, everyone will praise you for beating your wife. Go on! Hit her, goddamn it! You'll be the one who'll beat me to death. Yes, Chood, beat me. Where are you going? To get her some medicine, you idiot. I'm so sorry Bua Klee. It's unforgivable. Whatever you do, I'll forgive you. So you're not mad at me? No, I couldn't be angry at you... because I love you so much. Bua Klee, my darling. Why did you hit me with the cane? Have I done something to deserve it, something really bad? I... If you don't want to talk about it, then don't say anything... but I know a lot of people speak ill of me. But perhaps it's something else? Whatever it is, I don't care. No-one is as kind and good as you... my own beloved wife. Promise to love me long time! All my life, beloved. So everything went well? I knew it. I'm a clever man. A first class exorcist. I've exorcised demons for as long as I can remember. Your wife's case is nothing special. The vampire has left her now, isn't that right? Not the vampire, but something else has. What could that be? This! Blood! Yes, that's right. Blood. And not just blood, but my wife's blood. Accursed doctor, you have ruined my family! If you weren't so old, I'd... Old? You don't know what you're talking about. I can still put up a good fight! Come on then! Let's go a round! I'll wade in your blood! It's better get out of here... or else I'll beat you to a bloody pulp, you scum. I'll get you one of these days! Just remember that you and your vampire wife... are going to have a hard time. I'm a man of my word. Remember that! Bua Klee! Why did the doctor say those things? Why is he claiming I'm a vampire? Why did he do that? It's just jealousy. He wants to destroy our love. Is that why? It is. Can you think of anything else, my love? Muang, tonight, I will take my revenge. Your vampire wife shall die! Come, demon, come! Just try it! I'll send you back to hell where you belong! Come demon, obey, or I'll banish you to eternal hell. No! I beg of you! Please have mercy! I have a job for you. Go and fetch me Muang and Bua Klee. Go now and do my bidding! But I can't! And why can't you? I'm to be reborn soon... so don't force me to go... because I can't do it. You have to. Now go, all you have to do is control her mind. I will have my revenge! Please don't make me do it! I beg of you... If you refuse, I'll condemn your soul. No! Stop! Please! Go then! Go now! Come out! Follow me! Come! Come now! Why is it taking so long? Why did it take so long? Where is Bua Klee? I came back for your life, idiot. Ok, let's try! But don't beg me for mercy and reprieve. I'll send you to hell where you belong! It won't work. You have a devil's heart! You don't know what sin is. Your luck has run out now. Now there are no-one left to save you. Run out? Bah, bullshit! It's your turn now. Oh no, my dear demon! I'm no demon... and I've come to take your life and your soul. Now it's off to hell. Bua Klee! - What is it? - It's Bua Klee. What happened to her? I don't know. What am I doing here? What's going on? Don't you know? I have no idea. Don't you know how you got here? No, it's like a dream. I dreamt that someone was calling me. This doesn't seem good. We can't stay here. The doctor is vindictive... and the neighbors hate us... so we might as well leave this place soon. It's not safe here anymore. You decide. I'll follow you anywhere you go. What do you say Chood? Are you coming with us? We could all go together. Think about it Chood. I won't force you if you don't want to go. What did you say about old man Cheng? He's a hunter, and my best friend. He'll welcome us He may like you, but do you think he'll like me? What do you mean? Everyone dislikes me, they say I'm a vampire. Don't listen to them, they're just jealous of us. Then you don't believe it? I don't believe in anyone but you. You're my dear wife. You're my whole world. You're my life too. Let's keep going. It's my fault you're in all this trouble. I said, 'for better, for worse,' 'for richer, for poorer,' we'll always be together. I miss Chood. Too bad he didn't want to come. Yes, it's a shame. Chood is my best friend too. Maybe he had his own reasons for wanting to stay. Wait! Wait for me! That sounds like Chood. Wait for me! I'm so glad you came! I didn't think you'd join us but here you are, in the flesh! But we're all good friends, right? So you've ran the whole way? Good. Stay, now that we're together. It's peaceful here. No-one will bother you. Get comfortable and make yourself at home. That how we are. Thank you very much, the both of you. It feels like sitting in a cool shed. Same here. Thank you very much. You dont' have to thank us. There's plenty of land here... Pick a spot for yourselves Thank you very much. I really don't want to go... but we have to have something to eat before the harvest season begins. Don't worry about me. You're so used to hunting and... This time auntie doesn't have the time because she has to prepare for the birth. You can leave me alone. It's not problem. How's the baby doing? Oh, it's fine. Perhaps it's a boy. You like boys don't you? Sure, but what do you think? I want one of each kind. Can we manage that? Of course. We'll help each other out. You wish for a girl, don't you? Yes, I'd probably prefer a girl. No, you wouldn't have time for work. One at a time is enough, and it's our child after all. No point in arguing about that now. You'd better look after yourself more instead. You have to look after our child. You take care of yourself too. It's a long time since I started loving you. Are you two done now? Or... I can wait. I don't mind, really. It's not a new thing, I'm used to it. No, don't let your friend wait. - Bye then. - Yes, bye! Don't forget that I'm hungry! So very hungry! Did you hear me Bua Klee? I'm hungry! Let's go eat. This worries me. Doesn't it worry you? Why? I was here first! The girl doesn't know her place. She's going to die if she doesn't give up soon. Take this vampire! Hey there! Where are you going? Help! Help! Does it hurt a lot? She bit me in the ass! She needs to be stopped. Can you deal with her for me? She got away, but I got in one good hit. Did you learn anything? Yes, sure. Who is the other vampire? Her name is Bua Klee. Where does she live? At the edge of the jungle. and she's pregnant too. This is pretty fortunate, huh? Yes... The day she gives birth... is our day of revenge. - Hello. - Good evening Chood. Has she given birth yet? Not yet, or we'd hear the baby crying. Bear with it a bit longer. You must have patience. That is one of the greatest of woman's virtues. Take a deep breath! Better! Why does it hurt so much? Try again! Deep breaths! Better! That's good! Good God, help her! It hurts so much! Take it easy. Why is it like this? Relax! Take it easy! Are you almost done? Will it be much longer? I'm so anxious to see you. Come here and help me Muang! Just take it easy, try to relax. I was just going to have a drink... Let me have a sip first. Wait! You idiot! What is it that you've put in this? Wait, Uncle Moedy! My name is Chaeng! Wait, you've got it all wrong! You've did it yourself. Why don't you say anything? That's really simple, you didn't ask. Either way, I'm going to smash your head! The baby is born! Hurrah! I've become an uncle! I'm sorry, I'm really sorry! They're all drunk off their feet. We'll eat the baby until it's heart stops beating. Yes, I want the heart. I like the taste of baby hearts. They're so juicy and delicious. Wait here, I'll go get the baby. Bua Klee, wake up now! Wake! Hurry! Wake up! Wake up right away! The demon and his vampire wife are here and mean you harm. They're going to take your son. Wake up! Hurry! Help your son! They're here, Bua Klee. Wake up, quickly! Why aren't you waking up? They're about to take your baby! There's someone here! Help, Muang! Help! Hurry up uncle! Where did it run off to? It was here just a minute ago, then it disappeared. What was that? Get in the river, not the boat! Hurry out! My husband has died. My home is gone and my body has vanished, where shall I now find a body to occupy? What will I do now? Where will I go? What will become of me? Go away! Shoo! Please, help me... For the love of God, help me I can't do anything for you. There's no-one who can help you now. I can only give you some advice. Ask the almighty to be merciful. Repent for your sins. May God be with you! God forgive me... Hello, is the town elder here? I'm the town elder. I'm sorry. I'm Boon Muang. Uncle Chaeng isn't feeling well... so I came and brought this in his place. Oh, I see, come in to living-room! Sit down, my friend. Have a drink and make yourself at home. We can talk business later. I'll let my men know to unload you cart. Aunt Phun, don't tell anyone about the doctor. Remember, no one! You can trust me. I won't tell anyone. You know I can keep my mouth shut. Good. We've known each other for a long time. You're just in time. Alright, now about the goods you brought... what can I get for 20 tamlung? - Fetch the money! - Yes, daddy. The road is much better now that it's stopped raining. Yes, much better. Here you are daddy. This is Muang. A hunter, and relative of Chaeng. And this is my daughter Madua. Here's the money. Please count it. No, that's ok. I have to go now anyway. Can't you stay for a couple of days? Thanks, but I better not. Maybe next time. Can I go with you for a short bit? I have an appointment just outside town. Alright daddy? It's okay by me if it is with you. Will you be coming back? Yes, if there's need for it. Can you say when? Not for sure, but I'll try. Oh, my God! Muang! Who could have done that? It's the first time Muang is here. There must be several men out there who secretly love Madua. One must have seen her with Muang out there. It probably happened out of jealousy. They shouldn't have done that. Muang came to see me, people might think badly. I don't care who he is, if I only knew... It's not proper to let him sleep in your bed... no matter what the reason. But daddy! He's our guest. I just want to take proper care of him. Isn't that right, Champoo? Sure, sis. You two are like two peas in a pod. And if we've already gone this far... How are you feeling? You're very kind. That's because I'm fond of you. He shouldn't be going out of his way for me... After all, it's my first visit. We'll do a proper examination. I'll have him do it soon. It's almost lunchtime. I'll fix up some food for you, you need your strength. I'm not hungry. Hungry or not, you're going to eat something. You need nourishment or you'll never get healthy. Muang! It's nice to see you here, Chatr. Now that you've seen me, you shall die. Die? I don't understand what you mean? Don't you? You're my sworn enemy. First Bua Klee, and now Madua. And now you're going to take her from me. - Wait! - Die, you bastard! You've misunderstood, Chatr! Is that why I've lost Bua Klee and Madua? Chatr, stop it! If you kill Muang then you will die too, so don't even think about it. Madua! Now I know who shot Muang! You're the one! I didn't! Don't lie! I did it for you! He already has a wife. Her name is Bua Klee. So he's married? He lied to you and deceived you... so I was forced to kill him. I did it for your sake. Is what he's saying true? Yes, I have both a wife and child. They're called Bua Klee and Chiep. There, you see? I did it for you. Shut up! Muang, you know how much I love you. Is that so? That meant nothing. Just a lovesick girl crying. It's very easy to say... But do you really want him? Yes I do. I've never loved anyone like him. Listen to what a wise old woman has to say. If you can't win by tricks and deception... or with prayers, you must use the charm of the demons. - Demons? - Yes, the great demon charm. Did you see the flame? Yes, it caught on, and then vanished. Afterwards, I couldn't find any ashes. Where did you see the flame? Near the old ruins. This afternoon, when I was picking pears. There's said to be old treasures there. Should we go collect them? Trying to dig them out is a waste of time. There are spirits guarding the treasure. - There's spirits? - Yes, and only one who is lucky will see such a flame. By lifting the curse, you can get to the treasure. How do I do that? By immediately after seeing the flame... take off your clothes, and smother the flame with them. Then you'll get at the treasure. Is that really what you have to do to get it? Don't take it so seriously. That kind of business is dangerous to trifle with. I must be brave. Maybe nothing will happen. Why should we be afraid? I must be brave. We have to take the risk. Oh, I'll be rich - a millionaire! Now we'll stick together, all three of us. Bua Klee! Don't try to take my treasure! It's not time yet. You're not supposed to have it yet. Give it back to me. It's best that you give them back... for you have yet to atone for your sins. You must have patience and wait. Soon it'll be your turn. Madua, don't go! I love you Madua. I love you of all my heart. Don't go, you're the only one I love Madua! Muang! What the hell are you doing? Daddy, we love each other! What do you have to say for yourself, Muang? I admit I've done wrong, but I love Madua. I never thought you'd do this to me. But it happened nonetheless. Love, and take well care of each other. for better, for worse, 'til death do you part. I hope you have many children. I never would have thought that of him. I don't understand, I've always been good to him. I never would have thought that of him. Your daddy doesn't love us any more, Chiep. I love you, mommy. You'll see, daddy will come back. He's told me how much he loves you. I'm sure he'll come back home. If he loved us he wouldn't do this to us. I'm sorry... If I hadn't been sick that time... this never would have happened. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. It's Muang who makes me sad. Does he really love the town elder's daughter that much? Yes. I tried to talk to him, to get him to come back... but he only got angry, and hit me. Everyone in the neighborhood is good, except one. - Who are you thinking of? - Champoo. The younger sister. Muang is known as a good man, something must be wrong. Chood, I want to ask you something. Did you notice anything particular? With Muang, I mean? Yes, maybe... Apart from his boundless love for Mauda... he seemed to be forgetful and absent. It was very bad, at times he didn't even remember his own name. Then he's probably been bewitched. Bewitched? Yes, acting under a trance. The Dong Dok-Keo area is well known for their seances. A man named Rueng is famous for his seances and spells. Is this true? Yes, but don't worry. I know how I'm going to sort this out. Tell me what I must do! You can't, Bua Klee. Muang would go insane if he saw you now. There must be someone who can get close to him. I can. No, not you either. The best choice for this... is Chiep over there. Will you come with me Chiep? Yes I will grampa. I don't want to see my mummy cry. I'll help get daddy back, isn't that right? Oh, my son. Why are we stopping grandad? We need to rest a bit. I'm not tired yet. I want to see my daddy. I know your parents love you, so let's go. - Where's the house? - Over there. Come, let's go get daddy! Take it easy! We have to look around a little first. Chiep! Gone... I didn't just imagine it. I have to control myself. It's too late now. What is it, grandad? Grandad, where's your head? What do you mean Your head was gone, but then it came back again. The old ones say... he who casts no shadow... or has no head, is a dead man. Maybe this is the end? Shall we go grandad? I want to find him soon. I'll go hang this on my daddy. We'll go back home now, we have to perform a ritual first. I'm not going back! I have to help my daddy! I have to take him home to mommy. No-one can fight this. What are you doing here? I've come to see my daddy. Who's your daddy? Boon Muang is my daddy. There's no Boon Muang here. Yes he is. He's bewitched by a woman who took him from mommy. There's no-one here by that name, I tell you. Hear that? Daddy! It's the maid's son. - Daddy! - Damned kid! Let me go! Daddy, daddy! Chiep? Put this on, and come back with me to mommy. Are you trying to break my charm? Now you die, bastard! Daddy, come help me! Don't run away! Help me! - What are you doing to the boy? - I'm going to kill him! Are you crazy? You can't kill him, he's just a little boy. That doesn't matter, mind your owned damned business! - Have you gone mad? - Maybe I have, now get out of here! - No! - Die, dammed kid! Help me! Sister! Get up Madua, get up! Madua! Do you feel okay now? Chiep! Your daddy is himself again now. This should never have had to happen. Please dad, come home! Mommy is waiting for you. The town elder and his men are coming! Hurry off now! Dad loves Madua the most, he won't listen to me. Come, let's go. Rest in peace, Madua. Hurry, out through the back door. Are you tired? Let me help you. No, I'm fine. Let's hurry then. My poor daughter. I shall take revenge on your behalf. We must spilt up. You take that road, I'll go this way. You three, come with me. Slow down. I'm stuck. Wait! Ok, I'm good. Someone's following us. It must be the town elder and his gang. Hurry up! Quickly! They went this way. I'll turn back and distract them. You'd better take Chiep with you. Do you think that'll work? Yes, give me your gun. I want to be with my daddy. No my son, go with grandpa. I'll follow. Jump on my back! Quickly! Do as grandpa says. Daddy! Don't let them get away! After them! Where is daddy? Daddy! Why aren't you coming? He'll be ok. We'll go on ahead. Drop the gun! Wait! We'll kill him later. You hear that Muang? Oh, Chiep... Mommy! Chiep, Chiep! Chood! Chood! What is it? It feels like Chiep is calling me. Try to relax a bit and not worry so much, they'll be back tomorrow for sure. I'm worried for Chiep and the rest of them. I have to go to Dong Dok-Kao. Don't. Uncle Chaeng said you weren't to go anywhere. I have to. I can't stand it any longer. Something awful has happened, I can feel it. In that case, I'll go, and you stay home. I feel so uneasy. What could have happened to Chiap? And with Muang? I can't stand it anymore! I have to go. Chood! Chood! Something awful has happened! - What is it? - Madua is dead, and... You're dead too Chood! No Chatr, Chood has nothing to do with this. He doesn't? Isn't he Muang's friend? Uncle Chaeng! Where's Chiep? Chiep! No! My poor baby! You've killed my son, so you might as well kill me too. Hey, take this you bastard! The say a friend in need is a friend indeed! What is that? Don't be scared, it's just the vampire. The vampire! Kill it, kill it! Kamnan! Chatr, you shot me! But I shot at the vampire! - You'll die! - No, no! Kamnan! Daddy! Wait Muang! Your son is dead my love. What are you going to do? Wait! Don't do this! Wait for me! Please, wait! I can't live without you! Kill me, if you're thinking of leaving me! Bua Klee! Could you really leave her? Bua Klee is a vampire! No, she's not. She's just possessed by her grandmother Chim's spirit. Grandmother Chim? Yes, through her death. Bua Klee had a sin to atone for and thus was open to possession. But it's all over now. Look! Bua Klee is free form her sin now. Now no spirt can hold her in it's grip. She is free - Boon Muang! - Bua Klee!
