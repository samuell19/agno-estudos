This is a painting from the 16th century. Here we see Judith... with the head of the enemy captain, Holofernes, whom she seduced and beheaded to save her besieged city. - Will the travelling be a problem? - Excuse me? I see that you live outside of Brussels. It won't be easy. - I've rented a place in town. - Right. - Could you call the next candidate? - Yes. FLAT FOR RENT It's pathetic. Oskar, don't be ridiculous. It won't matter this one time. You're crazy, you know that? One chance in how many? A million? Five million? You're not listening. We had a deal. It's a question of principle, isn't it? - A question of principle? - Ever heard of trust? Don't make such a fuss. A child isn't the end of the world. Not for you, obviously. A little baby. Come on, stay here. Stay with me. Stop. Stop it! Excuse me, I've come about the room. - Am I in the right place? - Yes! Second floor. - Excuse me. Laura. - Muriel. That's it. I'll get the keys. Just a second. Take your time. My mother used to live here. Until recently. Are you from round here? I work as a guide in the museum. I do guided tours. That's nice. All those guys staring at you and having to keep their mouths shut. So, what do you think? It's just what I was looking for. I'll take it. Do you realize what you're saying? You musn't panic. We've got the business. We can build a house, or buy one. We can do what we like. Whatever we like. Did you listen to what I said? What do you know about art? What the hell will you do in the city? Muriel... Give me the name of one artist. Just one. A Belgian artist. Just to see... Let go of me! Muriel, wait. Wait! You should have been upstairs at 4 o'clock. It's your life, Muriel, your promotion. - Where were you? - At Luc's. I called. You weren't there. Has the cat got your tongue? You're just like your father. I've found a job in the city. A job I really like. At the museum. I've rented a room. With my own money. I start on Monday. Shall I leave this here? I'm going to bed. The Woman with the parrot is lying down, her long luxurious hair spreads over the sheets. Her body, white and naked, stands out against the dark green atmosphere at the setting. Her attitude, her voluptuous bosom, her hips turned towards the viewer and the colours in the foreground suggest she is a girl from the harem. She is offering herself... Muriel? Are you asleep? She is already asleep. Oskar? It's me. I don't understand why you're cross. It's not as if I'm pregnant. Call me. Hello, Mum! Why is it on so loud? Where's Oskar? - He says hello. - And a kiss? Yes, of course. There now. I'll do your hair. It's all flat. It can't be twins. Are you eating enough? Yes. Not too much of that. I've got to dash. The girl's coming for the room. I don't want you to rent it. Mum... It's just till you come home. I need the money. I don't want her sleeping in my bed! Not on my mattress! It's starting. "Vincent, I want you to take me to a faraway island." "Irene, this isn't the right time." "When, then, Vincent?" I'm sorry, I haven't had time. I'll tidy up quickly, so they won't get in your way. All these clothes! My mother had a different dress for each man. Incredible! She was crazy about Oskar, my boyfriend. Well, boyfriend... She wanted so much for me to be pregnant... I told her I was. I told her I was pregnant. I'm rambling... What about your Mum? Is she in good health? Yes, but I don't see her often. I've been living alone for a while. Right. There... You can use the crockery. The shower's at the end of the hall. You can use that, too. Bring anyone you want home with you. But not in my shower! - There. Will everything be alright? - Yes. Right then. I'll leave you to it. Muriel. It's your mother. I'm sorry. I gave her your number. Hello, Mum. I'm fine. Yes, the room's fine. Yes, the owner. I can't talk now. I'm standing in the hallway. I was just going to bed. I start tomorrow. Yes. Alright. Yes. Good night. Do you think it's normal? No explanation. No apology. Nothing. She stole away like a thief this morning, so she wouldn't have to talk to us. You spoke to her. I don't know anything. She's got the job she wanted. Is that all she said? No. She said that you deserved the promotion. That you'd worked hard for it. That's what she said. Hey, doll. Alright? We saw 14 candidates. That's a lot of people. And I regret to have to say, that you were not hired. Goodbye. Look, I can't help you. The other jobs are for men. I'll see what I can do. We can see that the artist wanted to study the female body. It's quite obvious that he was in love with his models. He must have known their bodies intimately. He must, therefore, have had three mistresses. I wouldn't mind painting you. Oh yes? Come on. Let's move on to the next painting. - Hello. - The TV Magazine? Help yourself. There. Thank you. Wait 20 minutes. I'm going over at Oskar's. Then we'll go home together. OK? That's it for today. So, how was your day? Full of Japanese tourists? - Hello, Sanzi. - Ah, beautiful people. - Have you seen Oskar? - No. Would you give him this letter for me? Here it is. Bye. Ah, here's Oskar. Go ahead without me. I'll catch up with you. OK? - We have to talk. - Talk, then. I mean it. This pregnancy was your idea, too. For your mother, Laura. Just a tale to keep her going. A joke. A joke? Maybe for you. I don't want kids. Not now, not ever. But I do. I'm 36, Oskar. I need to move on in life. We made a deal, and you know it. - And then? - What do you mean, then? I don't want to make love thinking you might get pregnant. Well then, maybe you should join a monastery. Come on, let's go out on the town. What sort of men do you like? Come on, let's check those guys out. Hey boys, is this the new fad? - What? - What? Being the silent type! - Would you like a drink? - A whiskey on the rocks. - Same for her. - Her too? Two whiskeys on the rocks. It's weird being here with you. I usually only go for the good-lockers. But it's not bad. Where are you going? Laura! We have to talk. Open the door. Are you going to answer, or what? Sorry. I thought... I'm Oskar. Muriel. You were with her last night, weren't you? - Do you know where she is? - No. I haven't heard her today. When she gets back, tell her I'm waiting in the caf√© opposite. You'll catch cold. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Muriel. Thanks. This is Alain. Muriel, my neighbour. Yes? I'm going over the road to see Oskar. What's wrong? Why didn't you open the door? Were you with somebody? Yes. He stayed over. You mean he fucked you, Laura. I want to get on with my life. Get on? Try out different men, until you find one to give you a kid? Every day a new guy... Something different each week. A CD, a singing career, a kid... men... Make up your mind, for Christ's sake! She says hello. You're not going to call her every day, are you? - They practically shit inside. - Yeah, yeah. She's got her own life, Martha. And we've got ours. I've been thinking about the promotion. And? You'd be in here, nice and calm... Near me. Now that Muriel has gone. Do it for your own sake. Take your time to think it over. - Take 2 or 3 days off. - I wouldn't know what to do. - I can think of hundreds of things... - Yes? - ...that you could do. - Such as? You could go out for a drink. She said "the middle drawer". Sometimes I think she just wants to keep me busy. Say... What do you think of Alain? - He looks fine to me. - Yes? I can just see him with kids. I've only seen him once, how would I know? He's not all that young, Muriel. Neither am I. I'd better get busy, hadn't I? Yes... Have you seen those photos? The ones of Oskar's move. I give up. - What are you doing here? - Your mother told me where you work. - You shouldn't come here. - I paid to see you. I've waited long enough. No letter. No phone call. You haven't been in touch. - We have to talk. - Not here. - Where, then? - Nowhere. I'm working. - Afterwards, then. - No, I've got an appointment. - After your appointment, then. - Shhh. Come on. Muriel, I don't understand you. There's nothing to understand. I'm just doing what I want to do. Doing what you want? Sitting there wearing a man's uniform? - That must be fun. - Please go away. Muriel, I've been thinking. I admit I was wrong. I know I want everything, too quickly. I told my father I didn't want to take over the business yet. What's that got to do with me? Well, I love you. Nobody understands you. Nobody. Not your mother, not me. - You haven't got any friends here, nothing... - Oh? Haven't I? And what would you know? Perhaps a few. But you can't come and live here. - I'll give you some breathing space, but I... - I have to close the rooms. I'll wait for you at the exit. - Listen... - I've got an appointment. An appointment? You don't know anyone. Who with? Who's your appointment with? Come on. Tell the truth. If I told you I've got a boyfriend, would that help you understand? And do you fuck him? Leave me alone. Go away, please. Sign here, please. Here. Unilateral decision to terminate the trial contract. So, what do you think? Really? There you are. Guess what? - You're pregnant? - No. Alain likes my singing. He's going to make a demo for me. He knows some people in the music business. And he thinks I've got talent. Isn't that great? You're not very enthusiastic. A demo is almost a CD. A professional studio, and all. I got fired. I got fired. Why? - I was late. - Is that all? - What a lousy place. - It doesn't change anything, OK? Let's see what we've got. Here. Au pair, antique furniture, surveys... Does that suit you? I'm late. I had a group of Indians for the Flemish Primitives at 4 o'clock. It doesn't matter. Two coffees, please. - You're going to have two coffees? - No. One for you and one for me. I'm in a hurry. I've got an appointment later. - How are you? - Fine. We're very busy. Coachloads of tourists. And back there? We haven't seen Luc for a while. I told him I had somebody else. Is it true? I wouldn't say so if it wasn't. That's where I'm going, after. They want me to take the promotion to Daan's office. - What do you think? - It's your life. Sometimes I think I'm too old to change. It's what you always wanted. Perhaps you're right. - I've got to go. - Already? I'll show you the apartment another time. I'll call. I saw a dress I wanted to buy you. It's not far. - Now? - It's just on the corner. Alright. But we'd better be quick. Well? Your hands are cold. It's nice. Do you like it? - Isn't it a bit little girlish? - No. - So, what's your new sweetheart like? - Mum... I'm just curious. - Well? - Normal. Tall, blond hair... I really must be going. OK. Are you going to take it? I'll think about it. - I could leave you the money. - Alright. Do you think I'm going to do it on my own? Look at me, goddam it! Look at me! Get the hell out of here, I'm bloody sick of you! - What are you doing here? - Can I help? You can put up these 500 posters... - Ah, an angel... - Shut up, you! I can try. We women always get the hard work, don't we? - Hi, Oskar. - Hi, how are you? - Here, do you want some? - Yes, please. - She's pretty. A new recruit? - Sanzi was pissed. - That's a good one. - Thanks. - Your excuses get better and better. - Yeah, I know. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - I won't. Ciao. Have you known her for long? Since my first time. The first time I went sticking up posters. No, stick it on the window. - Here? - Yeah, right in the middle. Shit! Run, Muriel! Are you together? Yes. - Yes or no? - No. - Is this the first time? - First time what? - That you've been caught? - Yes. Yes? What's this I see? Graffiti on train wagons, in the underground, on public buildings... Quite the artist, aren't you? Somebody's lodged a complaint against you. Your father's just arrived. He's waiting for you in the corridor. I don't want to see him. Why did you do that to his shop window? If he doesn't withdraw his complaint, you're done for. Why don't you want to talk to your father? Mind your own business. Muriel. I lent them your bedroom. I'm sorry. They're his kids. Alain's kids. He didn't even tell me about them. Until today. I'm looking for a man, and what do I find? An ex with two kids. What am I going to do with them? - I thought you wanted kids? - Yes, I wanted kids. My own, not someone else's. I tried to put him off, but... What do you think? I'm tired, Laura. I don't know. I want to sleep. Yes. I'm sorry. Can they stay for a while? Just a little while. Alain will come and get them. I promise. I'm sorry. Sander... You're awake? I'm sorry to trouble you. They're my kids. I should have said something earlier, but Laura's a bit... Hysterical. Right. But it's my fault. - I'm sure she'll get used to it. - If you say so. We'll see. Right, then. Sleep well. Thanks. All I can see are the feet and the tail. - Hey, Sander... - Yes? Do you know what happens when you put one crocodile on top of another? You get lots of little crocodiles. - How many? - It depends. How many crocodiles? Tell me. Laura here. Yes. And here comes the Pizza boy! - Who's hungry? - Me! - I can't hear you. - Me! For Christ's sake, shut up will you? My mother. What's wrong? My mother. She's so still. Can she hear us? I don't know... Some say they can. I think so. Do you have children? No. Excuse me, I thought you had a son. Are you going to tell me what I've got and what I haven't? Dr√©, she's right. Bring us some coffee. That's our Oskar. We've not heard from him for years. He never calls. He may be in trouble. He'll be alright. Do you think so? Maybe he's got a girlfriend. All he wants to do is to cause us grief. And mess up our shop window. - And deface buildings with his filthy... - Oskar's a dreamer. Always has been. Madame fortune teller sees everything in her crystal ball. You know what's wrong with that boy? He's got no discipline. Oskar's fine. You know him? - Have you known him long? - A while. Is he well? Yes. I'm Muriel. Give me your hand. Mum? Guess who's here. Oskar. Do you think it helps? What? Me chatting? Of course. She listens in her sleep. She asked after you every day. - Why didn't you come earlier? - I saw my father again. And? Nothing. He didn't see me. I was at the police station. He was lodging a complaint. Great. And you? I'm great... I've got two kids. - That was quick. - Yes. Quicker than with you, anyway. Alain's a good guy. When he's there, we're never alone. I don't know... It's not simple. At least you made a choice. Ah, you're there. Guess who I saw at Mum's? - No idea. - Oskar. - Remember him? - Yes. These are the ones you were looking for, aren't they? Why did you take Oskar to see her? I didn't. He was just there. I didn't have to ask him. - What about Alain, then? - What about him? You mean I should take him? He's never without his kids. There's no way they're coming. - What's your problem, anyway? - Nothing. The kids needn't be a problem. I could take care of them. - Really? - Yes, every now and then. Here doggie... come here. Louie... Heel! What do you want? Are you bringing my coats back? Does it look as if I am? He recognizes you. My father said you'd been to see them. Yes, I was doing a survey. Stupid job. I saw him. We talked a bit. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Do you still see your parents? They don't live here. I can go home whenever I like, but... You never go? Do you think that's silly? I do since yesterday. He wants to get moving. Thanks for the posters. Will I see you again? Wait, Louie. I know a great place. You'd better put on your glad rags. See you Friday? Alain's just called. He can have the studio for 2 hours. My CD, Muriel, my CD... - Don't tell me you're going out? - Yes. I'm meeting somebody. What about the kids? You promised you'd take care of them. Now and then, not now. But it's the first time I've asked you. You could take them with you. It won't be a problem. I have to sing. Alain has to do the mix. I don't want them yelling in the background. - You could have asked me earlier. - Go on. Just for two hours. Please. - Just for 2 hours? You're sure? - I promise. You'll do it? You're an angel. I love you. Come on. It's alright. No, it's no bother. Is it, Muriel? I'm sorry for the short notice. We've got two hours in a studio... - Daddy, I want to come! - No, you can't. It's just not possible, children. - Laura, are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. Here's the number of the studio, in case you need to get in touch. You be good, alright? Promise? - Don't forget, Laura. - No, no, I won't. - Let's go, Alain! - Be good. Goodbye. Look, crocodiles! Those aren't crocodiles! Use the soap to wash yourself. You can do it on your own. - I want some too. - You want some lipstick? - Do you still play? - Sometimes. Do you feel like it? Concentrate, Martha. Yes! - Am I late? - No. It's alright. There's a reception every 2nd of the month, and a buffet every 15th. - Do you want a drink? - Yes. - Where are the toilets? - At the end of the corridor on the left. - Alright? - I'm hot. What's wrong? Laura, the light... What's going on? Where's your sister? What the...? Shit! Laura! What the hell's going on? They're on their own, here! Are you mad? - All alone, at night! - Muriel was supposed to stay. Well, she's not here. You lied! You said it was arranged... But everything's alright, isn't it? Laura, your life is one huge mess. They're my walls, it doesn't matter. Put the kids back to bed, and... - You're out of your mind, Laura. - Listen... Where are you going? I'm going home with my kids. Get it? Listen to me. I get involved in your life, and you let me down. I rent a studio, I mix a load of rubbish. I bring you home. I'm trying, Laura, I'm trying. And you just don't give a damn! Where have you been? You left two kids on their own in the middle of the night! As if you could give a damn. I waited an hour for you! Alain has left, and it's all your fault. It was my evening, and you've ruined it! - Do you realize that? - Your evening? For that stupid demo? All you ever think about is yourself. And what's your excuse? I'd love to hear it. My excuse? I was meeting somebody, and you knew it. Meeting somebody, eh? Who would that be, then? Who? Do you really want to know? Oskar. Are you in love with him? You went to bed with him, and to hell with the world. Is that it? Don't think he cares about you. Don't kid yourself, kiddo. He doesn't go for dull country girls. I'm his type. Why did he break up with you, then? If you're so goddam fantastic! I'm his type. And you don't even come near. Get out. Get out, I said. Go dream elsewhere to get your cunt wet. You can't sleep here. Go on, move it! Visiting hours are over, madam. I'm sorry. I have to see her. I'll only be ten minutes. This is intensive care. The rules must be respected. I'm sorry. I just want to talk to her for two minutes. She's not alone. I can't take the responsibility of... Just let me speak to her. 2 minutes. Is that so complicated? Two minutes, that's all. She's my mother! She's in a coma. She can't hear you! - Muriel isn't here. - Do I resemble her that much? - Are you Laura? - Yes. I don't know if she'll be back. - Surely she'll be back this evening? - I don't know. We had an argument. I threw her out. She might be back, or she might not. I just don't know. Might as well be honest about it. I'll wait for her, if you don't mind. - Don't you know how? - It's not that. What is it, then? You'd better leave. - How old is she? - 70. Have a seat. - She's in a coma. - I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. - You get used to it. - Did you get on well? She lived where Muriel is living. Lived. Is she an only daughter? - So, you live alone now? - Alone with my husband. - We've been together 35 years. - Excuse me? What did you say? 35 years? With the same man? I've got a few things to learn! I always pick the wrong man. Boys who don't want kids, or men who already have them. You can't know in advance. What's the secret? - The secret? - I mean, 35 years with the same man... And a kid... That's really something. No, I mean it. That can't be easy, eh? How did it feel, after 35 years? - I was all topsy-turvy. - Topsy-turvy! Didn't you know how to do it anymore? - Kissing, all that... - Kissing, all that... It's like riding a bike, isn't it? You never forget. No, but with another man... I think it's great. I think it's very brave of you. Really. And Muriel didn't know? No, she doesn't know. I don't think so. Mothers and daughters have no secrets from each other. We do. Maybe she suspected. - She never said anything. - That's just like her. Perhaps she forgot her key? If you've come for Muriel, she's not here. This is Muriel's mother. - Good evening. - Martha. Oskar, my ex. I'm not sure how to present him. Well, Muriel's friend. - Isn't she with you? - No, she ran away yesterday. - She didn't say where she was going. - Typical. I'm going to look for her. See you later, maybe. Is it still raining? There now, calm down. Yes, it's me. In town, at Muriel's. I'm going to stay the night. She's not feeling very well. No, nothing serious. But it's better if I stay. Is this the first time? - Yes, in 35 years. - Does he believe you? I'll leave you. I'm going to look for Alain. Right. - Good night. - Good night. It's noisy. - Is it still hurting? - No. What did you do this evening? I went out. With your friend? I haven't got any friends. - I thought... - I made it all up. I lied to everyone. I don't think Oskar will want to see me anymore. He came by earlier, looking for you. - And? Did you see him? - Yes. He seems very nice. Mum? Do you think I'm wishy-washy? You're a bit pale since you came to live in the city. I've always been wishy-washy. And skinny. I feel so ugly. You're beautiful. All mothers say that about their kids. That doesn't count. So what does count? I'm afraid. But what of? I get scared too, sometimes. Come on. What are you afraid of?
