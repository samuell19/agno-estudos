Hello? Anybody down here? That's it, I quit! You almost gave me another heart attack. Should have seen the look on your face. You're such a pussy. You freaking dick. Dude, you ever pull that‐‐ What the fuck was that? That sounds like a bunch of fucking kids screaming. Shit. Dude, your breath. Surprise! You guys. First, a birthday trip to Hawaii, and now this? It's too much. Hi, I'm extra. Nice to meet you. I'm regretting giving you my spare keys. Sure. I mean, we all got a lot of packing to do, but might as well cram this in. All right, come on, birthday girl. Blow out your candles. Thank you. She calmed down once we told her that she wasn't on the island anymore, that she was air evac'd off and all. Got it. Can I speak with her? She should be fine now. You know the deal. Just let me know if she started to lose it. Okay. I'm Detective Peterson, Maui PD. I'm here to figure out what happened to you last night. Now, I'm to understand that you had a traumatic experience on Kilahuna Island. The local found you in disarray on a road wandering barely conscious. I also understand that you're not traveling alone. You're here with three friends? And then she goes maybe you'd be more comfortable with your shirt off. And I was like ma'am, with all due respect, that's exactly why I became a pool boy. Wow. What is your life? It's like oh, oh, and a little bit of oh‐‐ Seriously, guys? Okay. Hey, I'm just living vicariously, okay? God, I'm starting to feel like if we go on vacation with these D‐bags, we'll up coming home in body bags. Oh, does that mean you're out? Because I could call the old lady. Yeah, right, 'cause she's real. Oh! Guys, I literally can't get over this. Ooh, I would say pinch me, but I don't know where Sam's hands have been. Oh, you know. That's disgusting. I don't want to know. Good god, Sam. No, but you deserve this. Besides, how else are you gonna finish your book? Yeah. And Stephen King says the devil's in the details, so we had to make sure you get a lay of the land. You don't even read. This is perfect timing. So I just finished a draft and I was thinking on the next pass, I want it to just be a little more specific. So I know nobody can go to the actual resort, but just being there in Hawaii is gonna be really, why is everyone being so weird? Okay. Well, we actually have another surprise for you. We found someone willing to take us to the island. That's impossible. Since the resort got shut down, the entire island has been restricted. The locals literally won't even say its name. Say its name, girl. Kilahuna Island! Kilahuna, Kilahuna, Kilahuna. Pack your garlic, pack your holy water! We're going paranormal! I don't even know what to say. Police that responded to the scene found this. Is this your phone? Ms. Sanders, if they're in danger, I've got to‐‐ They're still on the island. Who? Your friends? Miss Sanders, I understand this is difficult to talk about, but if your friends are in danger, we need to help‐‐ You can't help them. I don't understand. They're dead. Dead. How? Did somebody do this to you? She did. Who is she? The half‐face girl. Oh my god! I'm gonna be able to get real pictures for the pitch deck, you guys. Based on true events, the first people to set foot in the resort since its forced shut down. Yes, mama! Sell that shit! Pause. Let me get this straight. I know the resort is supposedly haunted, but you're telling me that no one's even been to the island? Aw, Sam, are you scared? Are you afraid the boogeyman's gonna get you? Boogeyman's not real. Yeah, but it's not the boogeyman that you have to be scared of. No? Like you said, the boogeyman's not real. Well, what is it then? Why don't you show him the YouTube videos you sent me? Oh yeah, that shit's terrifying. Okay, let's set the mood first. Hello and welcome to this week's episode of Paranormal P.I. Today, we travel to Hawaii to try to separate fact from fiction. Now, Hawaii is no stranger to hauntings and they have a wide ranging mythos for paranormal investigators to explore. In this episode, we focus on one in particular, the haunting of a now abandoned resort on Kilahuna Island. The Hawaiian Islands are filled with supernatural occurrences. One island and the structure that resides on it, Kilahuna Island, is home to a once breathtaking resort that now sits abandoned. It is now closed off from the rest of the world due to a series of bizarre and inexplicable events. The locals consider the land sacred due to the tribal battles held there in the past, leaving it cursed by the blood of war. Built in the early '90s, the resort was intended to be a magnet for tourism. But shortly after opening, it became overwhelmed by reports of aggressive hauntings. What you are seeing is the last known video of the resort, including some modern drone footage. We do not know who filmed or uploaded the footage. One room in particular was notorious for hosting terrifying events, room 306. Guests that have had the misfortune of staying in this room have reported a wide array of paranormal activity. Some visitors experienced hearing voices, flashing lights, and writing on the mirror after exiting the shower. The hotel staff began refusing to service 306, leading to the hotel closing the room altogether. Amongst all the hauntings at the resort, one spirit has a reputation that is feared more than any other, a ghost the locals call the half‐face girl. The story goes that the half‐face girl was a local villager who was attacked and killed on the island. She was brutally strangled to death with her jump rope and left for dead in the jungle, the animals feasting on her corpse. Those responsible for the attack were thought to be tourists staying at the resort, but no suspects were ever charged. The locals say the half‐face girl still roams the island and the resort, looking for her perpetrators to enact an eternal justice. From the sightings stem disappearances. The locals believe the half‐face girl had taken them and their souls to wander the island with her for eternity. After only two years of being open, the resort was eventually shut down and closed to all visitors. The only known access to the island is a small boat that ferries locals once a day. The locals maintain their side of the island and employ a small security force to prevent trespassing and perhaps further investigation into these events. Are the stories of Kilahuna and the resort true? With locals refusing to help anyone make their way across the island to the resort, the mystery may never be put to rest. Oh, great. Now, I really want to go there. I'm sure it's just the same old folklore as every other place. I mean, there are always practical explanations, but not at Kilahuna. Dozens of unexplained disappearances have occurred at that resort and the locals swear by the existence of the half‐face girl. Yeah, well, my aunt also thinks that you'll catch a cold if you leave the house with your hair wet. That's because you will catch a cold if you leave the house with your hair wet. That's not what I meant. It's a superstition, right, Lex? There's only one way to find out. We have to find the half‐face girl! I only got half a face. Take those off. Ew, that's the grossest thing ever! I'm still down to go. The legend of the half‐faced girl? I haven't heard that one in a while. It's not a legend. Have you ever been to that island? Yeah, once, when I was young. I remember the rumors, and I remember the resorts, and I remember how they closed the resort down because of those rumors. It should have never been built. Well, I could see how it would make for a great book. I mean, heck, scared the bejesus out of me when I was a kid. But let's focus back on what happened to you once you arrived in Hawaii. You mind if I record it? Paperwork. It was beautiful. Do you guys have room for one more? Let's go, girl. ♪ The sun goes down and comes up again ♪ ♪ I'm living loud, being who I am ♪ ♪ And when the music begins to die ♪ ♪ I take the silence and bring it live ♪ ♪ 'Til the sun goes down ♪ The rental car situation could have been a little better. What's wrong with the rental car? It's huge. What's wrong with huge? Yeah. I mean, it was the last one they had. I get it, swimmer's body is better than meaty, but you know. I wanted the Jeep. That would have been such a cute Instagram photo. They always want more. How far are we from the resort? It's close. We just have to island hop first. Island hop? It was supposed to be a surprise. Surprise. Nobody said anything about a helicopter. That's because we knew you'd complain about it. I'm just not gonna do that. Let's see. Lex, it's the only helicopter company that can take us to the other island. I mean, isn't there a boat we can take? There's only one boat a day and we already missed it. This is cheaper. It's gonna be fun. You guys ready to fly? Let's go! Okay. Okay. I think we should have took the boat. Saddle up, soldiers. Let's go haunting, Lex! Heli tower. Heli niner whisky hotel. East ramp ready to go with lima. Departure to the east. I hope this thing still takes off. Just kidding. You are missing out, Lex! Open your eyes. So, what's the deal with the resort? Is it real? I heard the stories. So it's real? No, I think the stories are bullshit. See, I knew I liked him. How many people live on the island? Well, just a few on the south side. Not too many on the resort side, you know, since they stopped maintaining the road. Have you been there? No, I don't care to go to places like that. Then how do you know it's not haunted? I never said it wasn't. There's a few ways to get to this waterfall when you try to hike to. You need to stay on the trails. Do not go anywhere the signs say you shouldn't go to. You don't want to get trapped in a flash flood out here. There's no one to help and there's no cell phone reception. Now, there's one boat that leaves tonight if you want to get off this island, and that happens at 7:00 p. m. Do not miss that boat. Okay, I'm gonna set my alarm so we don't miss it. Wait, you're not taking us back? Thank god. No, the discount didn't say anything about a trip home, okay? So. Have fun, guys. Thanks. You're welcome. Great. He left us for dead. Sam, why do you always have to say stuff like that? Let's just go. We only have about six hours. Only six hours. I think I was born to be an island girl. Can we all move here? I could never live here. Why? It's beautiful. 'Cause I need people and things to do. Well, you can literally do anything here. You could go to the beach or you could go surfing or hiking. Yeah, no. Couldn't do it because I need strip clubs. Really, strip clubs? I love strip clubs. Thank you, by the way. For what? What you did. What did I do? Bringing me here. It was all of our ideas. Yeah, but Bree may have mentioned that you paid for my ticket. I just know how much you like these things. I really appreciate it. You're welcome. I am literally already out of breath. I think that's probably the alcohol talking. Super original. You should write that in your next book. If you should be so lucky to inspire anything I write, Sam. I know I don't want to be anything you write if it involves ghosts. Seriously, why do you believe? Like you really want to hear my explanation. I do seriously. Okay. First of all, if there isn't some other dimension, then how do you explain that almost every religion since the origin of the human species believes in the afterlife? And on top of that, they talk about some way of communicating with deceased ancestors or deities. Like what about, what about praying and celebrating holidays like Dia de los Muertos, shamans? Okay, okay. I think that people make up stories. How the earth was created, how humans evolved, why we're here. Because those stories, they give people something to believe in, right? Which makes people feel better. And most of the time, that translate into them behaving better. The Bible, the Quran, cave walls, all of these like religious writings, they all promise this beautiful afterlife because it makes people feel better. They need something to believe in, hence the stories. I could be wrong. Okay. So you believe that because people need to believe, it all is fake? Yeah. All right. What about all of the photographic evidence of apparitions that we have? Fake. Poltergeist occurrences where there are multiple eye witnesses. Bullshit. My grandmother's spirit visiting me the night that she died. Definitely fake. Oh, you're serious? I know it sounds stupid, but it happened. When I was younger, we didn't really talk to my grandparents very much. And I was doing my homework one night in my room and I noticed that in the corner, there she was just sitting in the chair. I mean, she wasn't solid, but I could totally make her out. I could see her face and she smiled at me. She looked straight into my eyes and she didn't have to say anything, but I just knew it was gonna be okay. And then she was gone. So I told my mom and she gave me the exact look that you're giving me now. I am listening. That I was crazy. But then the next morning, we got a call and she'd passed away. So I looked it up, okay? I looked it up and it turns out that there are a lot of accounts where people, relatives, spirits, visit them in between when they leave this earth and they enter another plane. You're gonna post these instantly. I don't know, I could be wrong, but. I can't argue with that story. Great, now which way? Oh, there's a map. Okay, we're here. No, we're here. No, we're not. Bree, which way is north? Is that a thing people know? That's exactly what I thought. And now we're lost. No, wait, wait, we're not lost. Look. We landed here on the beach. We took this trail to there and now we're just somewhere in there. Exactly. So we should go to the waterfall. What? No, guys. We have to go to the resort. Okay, that trail is not on that map, but it looks like it goes pretty much directly there. Lex, it's your birthday. And I need pictures. Do not say it. Don't say it. Gram! I need my pictures for my Instagram. I hate the world for creating that word, but I'm down for the naked swim. Let's just go for a little bit. Yeah, we don't know where this trail's gonna take us, but we do know we can get there from the waterfall. Or we could just take the shortcut to the resort. Okay. Who votes waterfall? I vote yes. So stupid. Okay, let's go. Yup. Guys, it's my birthday. Shouldn't I have some sort of say in what we do? Happy birthday! It's amazing, dude. Go on, get naked. After you. Oh my gosh, it's cold! I take it the water feels so good. Sam, come on, man! What, dude?! Lex, come on! Lex, get in! I'm okay. Oh baby! We really should get going, guys. Come on! Come on, Lex! Live a little. Woo! I hate you all. Come on! Get in here! Don't watch me! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Turn around! That was the last time I felt truly safe. That was the last time I felt peaceful. You know, the way that trip was supposed to be. But if I had been paying attention, I would have noticed it. Something was off. Something was around us. And what was that? The island. Island was trying to tell us to leave. The island? I know you don't believe me and it's fine. You don't have to. It's not that I don't believe you. I'm just trying to figure out what's happening here so I can help your friends. You'll just think that I'm crazy. Alexandra, I can promise you I won't think you're crazy. Did you run into anybody? Did you see anything out of the ordinary? Does it smell weird? Yeah, it just kinda smells like tequila. I think it spilled all over it in the bag. That's completely disgusting. No, I'm good. Tequila ham. Yeah. Mmm. I just can't eat. Oh no, you just say that 'cause you're so scared of all the ghosts you're gonna see. There's so many ghosts on the island. I know you're afraid. I know, they're everywhere. What do you believe, Chris? Well, I mean, I believe there could be ghosts, yeah. Dude, come on. What? I mean, granted I've never had any experience, yeah, but it doesn't mean I can't see both sides. Well, I have. Bullshit. Yeah, then what was that painful monologue earlier about not believing? You guys want to know something I never told you? I was really religious growing up. I grew up in a Christian house. We went to church every Sunday. We did the whole thing. And one night, I woke up and I couldn't move. I could feel like this presence on top of me, like an evil spirit. And it was terrifying, so I prayed and I prayed. And finally, I could move again. I feel like there's a but coming. But in college, I learned about sleep paralysis, which basically is when you're sleeping, your body goes into this, it paralyzes itself, so you don't go act out your dreams. When that doesn't work right, you wake up in a dream state feeling paralyzed. People feel fear. They hear things. They see things. So what's more likely? Demon came into a 12 year old's room, gave him the people's elbow, held him down for a couple minutes, or it was a little sleep paralysis. Again, I could be wrong. You know, you keep saying that you could be wrong. Is that because you know you are? Ooh. Well, what do you believe? Well, I feel like if there's a God, then there has to be an evil. And so if you believe in like, goodness, then there has to be stuff like demons, and spirits, and negative things. So how do you really know? Are you mad? No. I just got to drain the lizard. He's so dramatic. I think he's mad. Chris? More than a hundred. A million. There's a lot. Come here. Hurry up, dude. Hurry. What the? Stay with the girls. I'll go check it out. Yeah. Who is that? Chris, be careful. Guys, it's just a sheet. Fuck that. I actually thought someone was standing there. Wow, you scare pretty easily. He's all talk. No. No, you all. That just further proves my point. You all saw someone standing there, right? Okay. Okay. Guys, let's leave. Let's keep going. Yeah. Yeah, we have about four hours 'til the boat leaves, so I think if we had that way, the map says there's a lookout point. Let's just go over there. Let's check it out, come on. Your stories, terrible. Are the worst. I just like trash. I think that's the top of the hill right there. Wait, stop. Bree, it wasn't a ghost. No, I'm saying there's a cell phone tower right there and I don't have service. Bree. Bree, that's not a cell phone tower. Yeah, it's a radio tower and I doubt it works. It's probably been here since Pearl Harbor days. Oh, Pearl Harbor. I'm a huge Michael Bay fan. What are you doing? I'm gonna climb it. Bet we can see the resort from here. I wouldn't touch it. Do you think it's still active? Sam! Oh, my nipples are so hard! Sam! I got you. Why would you do that? Oh my god, I got you. You actually care about me. You're such an idiot. Guys, she cares about me. That was pretty good. It was pretty good. Anybody want some? No. No. Okay. That's gotta be it. That's so far. It looks like a half mile. Yeah, we can do that. We just have to hurry. Can we stay up here and enjoy the view first? No. No. Okay. Fuck me. Great. Now what? It looks like we got a fence to climb. Oh, you guys, over here. Okay. Oh, you're gonna rip it? Oh damn, girl! Oh my god, good for you. I mean, I work out. I don't get it. What? They had to have spent a fortune building this place. And what, they just let it go to rot? Because it's haunted, Sam. Yeah. Never seen anything like this before Oh my gosh, you guys. Look at the difference. It's so pretty. Yeah, looks great. This is so perfect for my story. I have to film it. So who's going first? I'll go. Or Lex will go first. Keep out. Hello! Jesus, Sam. Hello?! Guys, stop. What? We're gonna draw attention to ourselves. There is no one here. Relax. So much for Hawaii's scariest resort. No ghosts, all stories. It's not like we're at the zoo. They're not just gonna be on display, Sam. What's with all the white sheets? I don't know. Maybe they were doing construction or something. Yeah. Oh! Sam, what the fuck, man?! I've always wanted to do that! Sam, you can't just start breaking stuff. Why not? Sam! See? God, man. I think you've had enough to drink. You might actually be right. That's a hell of a drop. Yeah. Okay, should we go check out the room? 306? Yeah. What, are you scared now too? Oh, they got one of those old thingumajigs. It's called a bell cart, genius. Looks like the whip! Sam, you're an idiot. Oh, you don't get it? What, that you're an idiot? Ghost. All right. Looks like somebody was just here. There probably was. Don't say that. You're scaring me. I'm gonna go explore downstairs first. By yourself? Are you crazy? I'm literally just going right down here. Let him. Maybe a ghost will get him first. We can only hope. I think this is the third floor. This place is creepy. Guys! Way better down here. Wait, stop. I want to take a picture. Oh, get ready. More squats! You used to like it. She definitely liked it. Smells like Sam's ass. Somebody definitely died in here. Wait, so what happened in here again? This is the place where the lights used to flicker and people heard voices. Yeah, and they reported seeing writing in the mirror with the two showers. Shit. How's the view? You're standing in the pool! Yeah. It's filled with dirt. Wow. What a view. Sam, you should come up here. This place is fucking massive. Gotta be some ghosts. Should we look at the bathroom? What do you think happened in here? I don't know. Could you imagine taking a shower and coming out to see writing in the mirror? I mean, you would think somebody was playing a joke on you. I'd be more scared of the voices. Yeah, fuck that. Oh wait, this is the room that the bellmen wouldn't come in. Yeah. You know, Sam better not come scare us right now. You know what, could you take a picture of me with the mirror in the background? Of course. Thanks. Nothing especially odd happened in room 306. I was just taking photos of what I thought was important for my story. So you did take photos inside of the resort? Yes. Why? Your phone, there's no photos inside the resort. They stop upon your arrival. So there aren't any of the rooms or room 306? No. Is there something I'm missing? Before we left room 306, that's when it happened. Oh shit. What? You look amazing. Get a room. Can you take another one, babe? My backpack looks stupid. What is that? That doesn't sound good. Yeah, wait, what is that? Sam's probably torturing some animals. Chris, you've gotta see this. That was so weird. The fuck was that? I don't know, man. Wow, of course we come when it's a full moon. Yeah, well at least we got some light on the hike back. Yeah, well, we should probably go home. Wait, what? I mean, we just got here. Yeah, but I don't want to miss the boat. Yeah, Lex, come on. We all want to see something, but it's at least an hour hike back and we'll be here all week. Let's just come back tomorrow. And pay for another helicopter ride? No. It's already 5:45. Yeah, so we have a little bit of time. We brought flashlights. Why would we do that if we weren't planning on being here at night? Yeah, for the hike back. Sam, we're leaving. We just got here. Right? Guys, come on. Well, this sucks. I really need something for my story. I know, I'm sorry. Maybe we'll see a ghost back at the house. We have more time, guys. Not if we stay here. The darker it gets, the more dangerous it's gonna be on the hike back. Dangerous? What do you think is gonna happen? Somebody's gonna die? We have flashlights. Oh, god. Whoa. You think yours is big enough, Sam? It can never be big enough. That's what she‐‐ That's what she said! You've been carrying that in your bag the whole day? Yup, it's my travel light. Your travel light? Guys, the weather is getting really weird. Are you guys sure this is where we came in at? Yeah, this is where we entered. I remember that road over there. I don't. Yeah, I don't think that this is right. Trust me, this is where we entered. I think it was back there. No, we didn't walk that far when we came in. No, it's around here somewhere. It's a giant hole. I think we'd see it if we were close to it. You know what, man? Screw it. Let's just dig. You're gonna dig? ‐ Do you have a better idea? ‐ It's a fence! It's a fence! They keep us from going through! Well, until you come up with a better idea, this is what I'm gonna do. Why don't we just find the hole that we came through? You guys, where is my backpack? Did you leave it? No, no. I had it. I had it in the room when we were taking pictures and then I. Chris, you left my backpack, didn't you? What? No. Sam, help me dig or we're gonna miss the boat. I don't want to get dirty. Chris, you left it. Shit. I guess I got distracted when the birds came and left it in the room, but can I just buy you a new one? No. You guys, you want me to leave my stuff? That's insane. Plus it has my phone and my wallet in it. Lex, come on. Bree, if it was your phone, you would already be inside. Yeah, but if it's backed up, you're good. Well, it's not. How is it not backed up? Well, I don't think it is, but it doesn't matter because I'm not leaving my stuff! Okay? I need my phone. It has my pictures and all of my notes on it! Lex, this isn't a good idea. Oh my god. I'll just meet you at the boat, okay? Lex! Dude, this is the exact part in a scary movie that pisses me off. Seriously, this is so stupid. It's 306 right there. Can we move a little faster? I don't have a flashlight, Sam. Mine's big enough for all of us. Where is my bag, Chris? I left it right here. You sure this is the room? Yes, this is 306. Then where's the bag? You're being so unhelpful. Oh my god. Where are you going? Is there anything over there? No? No, it's empty. Are you sure? Did you look all around the corner? It's not over there. It's am empty room, Lex. I know that. - ‐lt was before. - It's pouring. We have to go or we're gonna miss this boat. Okay, then let's check the other rooms. Guys! I don't know where he is. Get in here! Where did that come from? I don't know. I'm in here. Chris? Chris? God. Oh, shit. Found your bag. It was like that when I came in here. Lex, your bag was sitting in the corner. We didn't even come in this room though. Wait, but how did your bag get in here? What I want to know is how did a coyote get in here? I didn't even know they had coyotes in Hawaii. They don't. It kind of looks like it was escaping. From what? Guys, let's just get the fuck out of here. No. I should take a picture. Lex, come on. I know, I know. It'll be fast. Guys, I'm leaving. Okay, I'm going. Sam, thought you quit smoking, man. I did. Don't lie. I'm not lying. I haven't smoked a cigarette in over six months. Okay, but then who's is that? I don't know. Someone's here. Wait. Hit the light, hit the light, hit the light. Are we locked in? Hello? Hello? What are you doing? Bree, we're trespassing. They don't know that we're in here. And we don't know them. Sam, was there an exit by the pool? I don't know. I mean, I don't even think I can get us back down there. Then why are we heading there? We can just ask them for a ride. Because whoever that is probably isn't gonna be happy that we're in here. Whoa. Guys, turn that off. We need to have an exit now. I am not doing this. Okay. That thing we ran out is near the front. Fuck it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you got a better idea? I'll do it. Chris. It's security. Everybody in! Wait, no, what? We can't steal their truck! Yeah, we can. What about them? What if they need help? Go fucking help them then. I'm getting out of here. Sam, just leave the truck and run, man. I'm not leaving if we have this truck! What are you doing? Chris, give me the fucking keys. I'm not giving you the keys, man. Give me the fucking keys, Chris! Stop. We're not taking the truck. Get in the car, guys. Bree, get out! Chris, Chris, give Sam the keys. Let's go! Do you want to go to jail? Are you serious? Guys, guys! Chris! Bree, get out. Wait, what's going on? Bree, open the door, Bree. Bree. Bree, how did you do that? Why is it locked? Get out. Bree, what are you doing? I didn't do that! Can you hear me? Yes, yes, I can hear you. Guys. I think it's down here. Could you please help me? Wait, where is here? Guys, get me out of here! Guys! Watch out, watch out, watch out. Guys, guys! Bree! Bree! Oh my god. What if she's down there? What if she's still down there? We have to help her. There's nothing we can do. No, I'm going. I am going, I am going! Stay here! Stay here with me. Let him go down there, okay? Just let him go down there. She's dead, isn't she? Nobody survives a crash like that. I got you. I got you. Okay, so you're saying that this truck started on its own, shifted into gear, and drove your friend off the ledge? Look, I know what it sounds like, but that's what happened. Okay. Excuse me if it sounds like I don't believe you, but I find it hard‐‐ Hard to believe that a truck could have a life of its own and kill my friend. Pretty much, yeah. How do we know that she didn't just knock it into gear herself in a panic, and then‐‐ Because I was there and I saw it with my own two eyes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I gotta cover all the angles. It's just that I'm not used to chasing ghosts in a homicide investigation. Yeah, well, I'm not used to seeing my friends die at the hands of one either.
