Uzbekfilm Studios WHITE, WHITE STORKS Screenplay by Odelsha Agishev, Ali Khamraev Directed by Ali Khamraev Director of Photography Dilshat Fatkhullin Production Designer Shavkat Abdusalamov Music by Rumil Vildanov With Sairam Isayeva, Khikmat Latipov, Bolot Beishenaliyev, Mohamed Rafikov Tashmat is coming! The latest news! -Who? -Our mailman. He'll come down here, raise his hand and say "The latest news!" Attention, everyone! The latest news! In Japan the emperor's caught a cold! In London a hungry lion has eaten the zoo's director! In Chile the eruption of a volcano has taken place, and in our district center a sudden fire blazed up today. Our best barber's shop caught fire. Happily, all barbers were saved. As of today, all firemen will be shaved without an appointment! But you don't know the breaking news. Brigade leader Fatima from a neighboring farm had a baby. But it's been only five months since her wedding! And her fool of a husband visited her at the hospital with flowers. Five months? -Did you keep track of it? -Of course. I keep track of everything. I write it down so I don't forget. Every day, every hour. Want me to tell you when the wedding was? Scoundrel! What? What's that you say? Me, a scoundrel? Don't you insult me. I'm a sick man. I even have a certificate. You'll have to answer for your words. I'm an invalid! Here, look. Akram is right. I agree with him. They're flying! The storks! They're flying! The storks! The storks! Malika, why were you crying last night? Don't I have the right to have a drink with my friends? You're so silly... but beautiful. Don't! Malika! Malika! Make me a new saddle cloth for my horse. Don't you hear me? -Hello. -Hello. -Good morning, Shukur! -Hello. Hey, Karim, you're at fault again. Are you still chasing that girl? We're just friends. Friends, ha! Aren't you ashamed? You still have much to learn, dear. How dare you let your father down? Go sit down and do your lessons. Have you been demonstrating your character again? Father, you haven't had your breakfast yet. Come on. -Good evening, Malika. -Good evening. -Good for you. -Mama, sing some more. You liked it? Well, what will we sing now? Mehriniso, am I here to cook pilaf or dance? Mehriniso-apa, you've run out of wine. -I'll bring some more. -Sit, I'll serve it. -Good for you, Shukur-ata. -Such a good father! Very good. Learn from him. Pass me some radishes, please. All right. -Here. -Thank you. You've been working all day. Now I'll take over. You're always like that, father. So you like it? Then let your husband follow my example. Perhaps you'll help me to clear the table. Why? Is it Women's Day? There you go. You see? All this is right. But tell me, Kayum, when are you going to get married? Yes, you should have long ago. Yes. Hurry up, or it may be too late. We'll find you a bride, all right? There are plenty of them. Should we find one for him, Raihon? Well, I have nothing against it. Only on one condition: that your grandson will be present at my wedding, Shukur-ata. Thank you for those words. And we'll do our best! Open the door. Look! A stork! Ah, the boss is here. Come in! People say that storks bring babies. And I heard that babies are found among cabbages. My mother told me that I fell down from the moon. Mother, he recognized our embroidery. He really likes it! I wonder what he finds so tasty about it. Well, Malika, shall we grow cabbages in our kitchen garden? -What's the matter, Nigora? -Trouble at home again? -What happened? -Calm down. Come with me. -He hurt you again! -Don't cry. Nigora! Nigora! Come home, you hear? Or you'll be sorry, Nigora! What's the matter with her? Oh, those women. You can never please them. But she's crying. Sit down, Kayum. We don't meddle in others' lives in our village. Malika, they can manage without you there. Can't we sit quietly at least once? Of course. It's not Women's Day. Malika, add some hot water. Whose are these? Our tenant Kayum's. He's so strange. He wouldn't give them to me to wash. Said he'd wash them himself. Good evening! Kayum! What's happened? Why did they beat you? Those guys... they were harassing a girl. -Where are you going? -To the police. Don't. They got what they deserved. -Are you going home? -Yes. -Are you cold? -No. I've carried many things in my life: watermelons, cotton, chalk, lime, halophyte... but this is my first time carrying two people in love. We're not in love. Really? But you look it. As a child I tended horses like that, too. Do you like children? Yes. Why are you all alone here? It just turned out that way. Sleep, sonny. Go to sleep. -Mama, are the storks sleeping? -Yes, they are. Go to bed now, or Dad won't take you to the marketplace. -Come quick! It's Nigora. -What happened? She's leaving. Come on, we may be too late. He's drunk. She wouldn't let him come near the kids, so he lashed her. Nigora, don't go away! Where can you go with the children? I understand it's hard for you. We'll talk to him. Maybe everything will be all right. Don't go away. How is our Barhan, Yusup-aka? He got fat. I'll beat this laziness out of him, driving him every day. The goat will be yours anyway. I bet pilaf on it. -What are you doing? -Watch out, or you'll lose your bet. I'm not afraid. Barhan won't let me down. Here! -What's up, Kayum? -Lash me. -Go on, lash! -What's this all about? This man's wife has just run away from him. He lashed her like his horse. She's my wife. Why do you stand up for her all of a sudden? Shame on you. You've got children. Are they from you, you cock? What are you doing? Enough! Get out of here! And you, Yusup, go home. Let him go. So that's how it is? Because of my own wife! All right, then. Let me go. Get your hands off me. I'll kill her! Stop it, Kayum! He won't dare to touch her now. You can kill all our villagers like this. -No, he doesn't have enough hands. -Shut up. All right, enough of that! Maybe you were right, but we've lost our best rider. We'll manage without him. Maybe Kayum will try to ride? Why not, if he can. I'll try. Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't stop, please! Stop! Stop, I said! Stop the bus! Stop! Stop! Daddy! Don't stick to it! Don't stick, I said! Where are you going? Going to town, to the marketplace. Away, little frogs! Away! Hello, Malika. Hello. You like this spot, too? Do you know why the water is so clear here? No, I don't. Deep in the mountains there are springs gushing. There are twelve of them. Their water is very clean, and it never freezes. The springs merge and flow down here. When my mother gets ill, father goes to the mountains, gets a jug full of spring water, and mother gets well. The one who can carry the goat's carcass through three rounds will be proclaimed the district's best dzhigit. Go on, Kayum! Go! Go, Kayum, go! Attaboy! Wait! Where are you going? Who is he to you? Eh? -What is it, Father? -Go home. Shukur-aka, why do you do this? Kayum, I loved you as my own son, and you... -Was there anything between you? -Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Shut up! What are you going to tell your husband? How can I look him in the eye? He may kill you. And I won't be able to defend you. I simply can't! Maybe he's going to defend you? Yes. I will. Oh, is that so? Are you a Muslim or not? I'm just a man, like you. Then go away! You hear? She's my wife and she stays with me. Always. That's for Malika to decide. You're not a Muslim. You're a thief! -You had a light on all night. -I was reading. No, that isn't true. You were washing your shirts. That's right. I still can't do it very well. -What? -Lying. Malika, you've got to go. Will you write to me again? I will. What if I asked you to go away? Would you do it? I don't know. I don't think so. Hey, make way! You slut! Go away, dear Kayum! I beg you. It will be better this way. -Slut! -Don't, Akram! That's what you are, vermin! You've got a husband! Is one husband not enough for you? Or do you think you're so irresistable? Do you know what I can do with you now? Let me go, or I'll go myself. What? You can go to the devil! -Akram! -Get out! And never set foot in this house again! This is our mailman Tashmat. He'll come up now, raise a hand and say: "Attention, everybody! The latest news!" Here, a telegram for you. Tashmat-aka, have some tea. -Tashmat-aka. -Hello. -Any letters for me? -No. Kayum, do you know city girls well? Why? My son's returning from the army soon, and he's bringing a bride from Bukhara. She may not like my old house, you know. Why not make repairs? No repairs will help it. You know, those city girls want something special. I've been thinking. What if we decorate the walls somehow? -Can you paint? -Not very well. But you can, can't you? Don't be afraid, I'll help you. All right. Thank you, help an old man out. Thank you very much. Tomorrow I'll go buy paints. I'll buy all colors. The best paints. Hello, dear. How's the pilaf? Not burned? No, it'll be ready any minute now. Husbands are cowardly nowadays. In old times the grass would have already grown on that man's grave. In old times we Uzbeks had a good tradition - "Khoshar." For one day people forgot all about quarrels and enmity. And helped their fellow villagers. Thank God Tashmat lived to see this happy day. Who builds a house this way? Putting up the roof before the windows? Bring it here. We'll put it on the terrace. Thank you. Thank you everybody. -Tashmat, listen to me. -What do you want? I've built four houses in my life. You're doing everything wrong. Please don't interfere. Oh, they've brought the reed! Put it over there. -Reed is no good. -I beg you, don't interfere. We have to take a break. They've brought our lunch. Stop the work! Sit with us, Tashmat-aka. In a minute I'll make the tea. Akram, sit here. Here. Indian tea. Please have some. Who else wants Indian tea? The old man's so happy. He must already be thinking of the name of his future grandkids. Should I make some green tea too? Well? I think we'll finish by nightfall. We'll see. Tulkun! Bakhtiyar! You've got frozen. Come out, you hear? And you come here. Lie down. Who do you want to see? I was just passing by, and saw you. You've got a good face. Though you look unhappy. -Ready. Start it up. -Thanks, Kayum. Are you cold? Don't stay here. Go home. I brought dinner for my father, but he's asleep. When he wakes up, tell him that I went home to sleep. All right. I'll tell him. Mother? Eat, son. Your favorite piroshkies. They're still fresh. Thank you. You've grown so thin! A lot of work. Cotton! I'm glad you came. I've been asking you to come for so long. Don't think I've forgotten everything and forgiven you. One can't forget such a shame. You refused to marry a girl who was destined for you. You didn't follow the will of your late father. You've disgraced your family and yourself before all our relatives. So you're starting it again... Mother, try to understand me! I didn't love her. You would have come to love her. All right, enough of that. You'd better eat. I can tell you that Kayum will marry his bride no later than this autumn. Don't worry. We'll do everything we can. I won't let my daughter insult the honor of your family. Please drink your tea, or it will get cold. They say I'm over 100 years old. That's possible. The years just flew by, and I had no time to count them. Some think that old people just get senile and don't remember anything. I remember everything. I remember all the funerals and weddings of our village. I remember how women wept at the start of the war. I remember all of the good crop years. I even remember my grandfather. He kidnapped a girl from the Emir's harem. They cut off his head in front of a large crowd. But no one thought of him as a thief. They were in love. And later songs were sung about them. We haven't had Emirs for a long time. Times are different now. And I think there are no longer young men who would sacrifice their heads for love. Eat, dogs, eat. People say I'm greedy. My father had fifteen camels, thirty horses, two hundred sheep, four wives. And I'm greedy? Eat, dogs, eat. Go on, gobble it up. It's been a year since I came here. A year since I met Malika. A year. They say I behave like a neighborhood cock. Always meddling in others' affairs. Is that really so? My mother got old. Perhaps it's because of me. I'd like to know what happens in a year. Goodbye mother. Goodbye. Kayum, my son. Do you love your mother? Answer me. Come with me now. You'll have no happiness in this village! Mother, I can't leave now. You've got a home. Have pity on your old mother! -Who's going to bury me? -Mother, don't say that! Why did I have such a son? You prefer that slut to your own mother! May she be damned! May this village be damned! -Mother, wait! -I have no son anymore! No! Where are you going? I won't let you out. His great-grandmother was from Bukhara as well. -She was famous for her beauty. -You don't say! Congratulations. They're coming! They're coming! Where's the bride? There's a beauty from Bukhara for you! Hello, Father! Congratulations, father. A little souvenir from the bride's parents. Congratulations, children! -Congratulations. -Thank you. -You've got a fine daughter-in-law. -Yes, she's a good one! Only she's got blue eyes. Ah, it's all right. As long as they're happy together. Right. Dear friends! Fellow villagers! A nice, blue-eyed, fair girl has come to our White Storks village. Let's drink to her, so that she finds joy, love and happiness here! Kamil dzhan! Dasha! My dears! May your nest be your inviolable fortress. Love each other as eagles love their native mountains. May you live until the snow melts on the old and wise Elbrus. Dzhigits, may your horses drop dead, may your chests become empty, may your wives run away from you, if you don't drink this cup to the bottom! The latest news. Pilaf will be served now, and then shish kebab. Help yourselves! Are you envious, Kayum-dzhan? I'll give you good advice. Hurry and bring your bride here. We'll arrange a wedding like this for you. What bride? I have no bride. From whom are you hiding this, son? Tashmat knows everything. The entire village talks about it. Bring her as soon as possible. You'll see what a welcome we can give her! All right, then. I won't keep meddling in your affairs. Where are you looking? Who are you looking at? People, how dare he look at my daughter! He's got a bride. I can't keep it a secret anymore! He's disgracing our family! -Go away! -Do as you're told. I don't want to see you again! Get out of our village! To hell with you! May you be cursed! Drive him out! Drive him out! What a shame. At a wedding! What was that for? Why hit her? Let go of me! Why? Why did you hit her? Don't you dare hit Malika. Why did you do it? You're a human being, aren't you? Listen, it's not nice. Kayum, son, I beg you! Go away if you can. My son's getting married. I've waited for this all my life. I know you'll understand me. Go away, and forgive an old man. Kayum, watch out! They'll kill you! Don't let her go! Shameless girl! Quiet! Silence! Have you forgotten where you are? You're at a wedding! You old gossipers! Haven't you thrown enough mud at my family from behind your fences? And now you want to ruin this beautiful day for the newlyweds? Malika is my daughter. I'll handle it myself. Old Shakur is still strong enough for that. Musicians! Go on playing! What shall we do now? I know it's my fault. I had to restrain myself. I've gotten old and stupid. Never mind, everything will be all right. You always say that. And I'm right, am I not, Mehriniso? Do you remember how your father wouldn't give you to poor Shukur to marry? How you cried then. But I said: "Everything will be all right." Oh, my heart is aching. I'm afraid I'll get ill again. I don't feel well. We shouldn't have hurt our daughter. I must go for spring water tomorrow. Why's that damned dog howling? The summer ended so soon. And the storks are gone. When did they fly away? A few days ago, at night. Storks always fly away at night. How do they find their way in the darkness? I don't know. By the stars, they say. You may fall! Karim, what if I die? Will you cry then? I will. Why don't you say anything? Don't you believe me? Yes, of course I believe you. Mehriniso didn't just die, she was killed. Her own daughter drove her to the grave! She doesn't even weep. Shameless girl! Stop, you infidel! Where are you going? Muslims! Stop her! How dare she follow the coffin! Never had a woman go after a coffin in our village. It's a sin. Shut up. Don't touch her. It's cold outside. Don't forget to put on your coat tomorrow. I'm not cold. -Was there any mail? -No. Tashmat went to a driving school in town. Why? The mailmen will drive motor-scooters now. Haven't you read about it in the newspapers? No, I haven't. Eat, Father, or it will get cold. Eat, Father. If you only knew how much I loved your mother. We used to live in the steppe. That's where we fell in love. Her father demanded a lot of bride-money. And I was a poor man. So one night I sneaked near the landowner's shepherds and stole astrakhan skins from them. I took as many as I needed for the ransom. But they caught me. According to ancient custom they were to cut off both my arms. I told the shepherds: "If you're human, leave me one arm, so that I can embrace my beloved. I'm honest before her." Where is he? What have you done to him? We already told you: we don't know. We have no idea where he is. We were drunk. First he hit, then Yuldash, then Yermat. You killed him. At least tell me where his body is. What? What are you talking about? What body? Don't say that! It's not true! Tell her! Why are you silent? Say something, or they'll arrest us! Shut up! You're in our father's house. He believed in God. I swear by his memory we didn't kill Kayum. I don't believe you! No! I don't believe you! I don't believe you! Thank you, Tashmat. -Good day, Malika. -Hello. -How are you doing, Shukur? -All right. Hey, Granddad, give it back! Give it back, Granddad! -Hello, daughter. -Hello. Returning from town? Yes, bought my daughter a present for Women's Day. Good for you. You haven't come to the teahouse lately. -I don't feel well. -Then come to me, we're neighbors. Thank you, I will. Goodbye. Get well. Don't forget us. Keep away from him! Why did you come back? What do you want here? You want my death? Don't even hope for that! Let go, don't hold me. He has disgraced my house. He killed my wife. Why are you holding me? I won't give my daughter to him! Why are you meddling in others' affairs? They'll sort it out themselves. Malika, keep away from him! I beseech you in the name of your mother! Keep away! Oh, Mehriniso... Mehriniso... What those gossips have reduced the old man to! Why are you holding him? Wait, wait. How dare he return to this village? He's a murderer! Listen, leave them alone. They're in love. Let them live as they like. The man is boiling with resentment. Let him speak his heart. Shut up, you gossiper. Messing in others' affairs again! Stop him! What are you doing, Shukur? Stop, Shukur! Look, the storks! They're flying!
