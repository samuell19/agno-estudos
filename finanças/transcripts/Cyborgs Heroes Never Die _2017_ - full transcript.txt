You expect me to believe one man done this? One man? One unarmed man did all this? It's what we're told. By who, exactly? What happened here? He was waiting for 'em. And he started asking questions. What about? About you. What about me? I don't know, but they started arguing. What happened? All hell broke loose. Keep working, you. We gotta get this railroad built. I know it's not much, but. It's perfect. You're perfect. And one day we'll have land of our own and a house for everyone. I'm happy where we are, Jing. I know, but. I don't need much. I just need you. I just need us. Forever. Forever. Pick it up. Pick it up. You either pick it up or I shoot you dead. Pick it up. Pick it up. I'm sorry. You just drew on a law man. Get up boy. You have got to be out of your mind. Get away from my bars. I didn't do anything wrong. Well that's a matter of perspective now, isn't it? Once the marshal gets back into town, he'll decide what to do with ya. When the marshal gets back into town, he'll see that I'm innocent. You are many things, but innocent is not one of them, boy. Jesus Christ, he really does smell like a fuckin' animal. You might wanna sick the hose on him, Frank. Ask me where I'm headed. Where you headed to, Deputy? Well, I'm glad you asked, you see I got a date with a lady friend, and I think our Mr. Chinaman knows exactly who she is, in fact, I know you know who she is. Now you have got to be out of your goddamn mind, I will paint these walls with your brains. I'm the one you got a problem with. Leave her be. Problem? I don't have a problem with you. I see you as nothing, except for something maybe that exists in between the dirt and the roaches, but nothing of importance in my world. Your woman, however, I do have a problem with her. You see, I have yellow fever, and I'm hoping that she's the cure. I'm terribly sorry to disturb you at such an ungodly hour, Miss... Phang, Miss Phang. Is everything okay? I'm not gonna lie to you, this is about your husband. I'm afraid he's in a whole lot of trouble. But I assure you, I am here to help you, in any way I can. Where is he? There was an incident at town. I saw it, it wasn't Jing's fault. Now now, I'm not here to discuss the law or who did or didn't do something. I'm just here to help you, you and your husband, to do this, peaceful-like. Hey Frank. Now son, I been patient, I have been kind, but you have done burned my patience down to the fuckin' ground. You yellow-skinned piece of shit, keep your hands off of the... Where's Jing? You said he was, I need to go find my husband. I believe you misunderstood my intentions. I'm sorry for the confusion. Your husband is obviously not here. I brought you here for personal reasons. Now, I can help reunite you with him, and I'd like to. But you're gonna have to do a little something for me. To get a little you gotta give a little. Now would you like to go see your husband? Take my hand. Oh. This place brings back memories. See, when I was little, this place used to be a slaughterhouse. Still actually see the blood stains of the animals. Nope. It's gonna be over real soon, okay? And then you'll see your husband. You'll see him real soon, just be... It's okay. That's okay. Shh. Shh. That's okay. Woo! Hey now. Oh fuck. Fuck. Oh fuck. Oh no no no. Oh no. Oh no. No. Hey! I need help! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey. Don't turn your back on me. All I need is a name. Chink. You better get going where you came from. I just need his name. I just need his name. You can kill me. What do you think I'm go do? He gave him what he wanted. What are you talkin' about? Said you'd be lookin' for him. Said to give this to Marshal Walker. Get some men together. And get me a tracker. What is it, Danny? Jake Sanders. What about him? Jake was our tracker. Then find me another one! Get! Make sure that they get a fittin' burial. What a damn mess. Jesus. He hadn't paid. Stick it on his tab, he's good for it. Get up! You gentlemen have me at a disadvantage, you seem to know who I am, I don't know who you are. Got a job for you. I'm retired. Not today you're not. So I'm guessing I have little choice. No you do not. Who's hirin'? Marshal Walker. What's the job? It's any easy one. Need you to track one man. It's easy, huh? Then why you need me? We need this done quickly. One thing I learned about trackin' men. It's never easy and you damn sure never rush it. Well now, that's two things. That one's a keeper. Where are my damn britches? Oh, shit. We'll be outside waitin'. Come on, Danny. The other riders'll meet ya in the mornin'. Marshal. Oriel. That should cover it. I'll take real good care of 'em. Just get 'em out of the street. Folks don't need to see this. Right, right. You stick to my boy like flies on shit till this is done. He takes a piss, you hold it for him, he takes a shit, you wipe him. But you keep him safe. Although Frank would very much enjoy that, I'm quite capable of taking care of myself. Which begs the question, why am I not going with them? Give us a minute, Frank. Because being your father, it's my job to protect you, James. Read this. Now you know why you can't go and why we need to end this, be done with it. Let me clean up my own mess. Best you remember who made this mess in the first place. Makes me sick thinking about what you done. Don't take your eyes off me, boy. Best we get this dealt with quick and let people forget about the Chinaman and his wife. They're not gonna... Hey. You're my son and I love you, James, but this is the last time, the last damn time. I made your mother a promise, God rest her soul, that I'd keep you outta trouble. Trouble just seems to find you, don't it? And right now I'm going to pray for forgiveness, and you oughta go with me. God turned his back on us a long time ago. You old fool. Lord, as far as the boy, I've tried hard to forgive him. But there's just no good in him. Never has been. But damn me, I made a promise to his mother on her deathbed that I'd see to it that no harm would come to him, even though I know it should. Forgive me for that. Please forgive me for that. Whoa. You see anything? Yeah. The town. You know Senor, we're gettin' real tired of your jokes. I just buried four of my men. We paid for results. Paid. First of all, nobody spoke to me about any money. Second of all, this guy killed four of your men. He did. Maybe. But I see badges pinned on you and your friends. We're not planning on bringing him in alive, Senor. Well, I'm a tracker, not a hunter. Do we have a problem, Senor? I don't. But you might, you don't put that steel back where it belongs. Now about my fee. Eh. Senor. When we find that Chinaman, and we don't need you no more, we'll come back to this conversation, huh? Can't wait. And just for the record, I like women. Ya baby. And he says that fella's lucky at cards too. Hey hon. Hi darlin'. Get up. Excuse me, gentlemen. Well ain't you angry enough to fight a bear with a hickory switch? There's four good men layin' in pine boxes out on the street right there because of what you did. You got blood on your hands, boy. I said I'm sorry. You're sorry. Sorry ain't good enough. I come in here and catch you laughin' and drinkin'. Might as well be pissin' on their corpses. Well what am I supposed to do? I ain't allowed to hunt the bastard, I ain't allowed to drink, what am I allowed to do, Father? You're gonna go home and you're gonna stay there till this is done. Maybe if we're lucky, we mend this quickly with you still alive, but I swear to you, I catch you in town again drinkin' or whorin' before this man is caught, you'll have me to contend with. You best be ready to go all-in. You're not worth the bullet, old man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hyah. That's the horse he stole from us. He's on foot now. Well I guess it says something about the man you're hunting then, doesn't it? The man we're hunting. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I said. And he's not a man. Horse is lame. Figure that's why he didn't want to ride it into the dirt. Hyah. Hyah. That horse don't look lame. Oh, you know a lot about horses then, do ya? I know that horse belongs to us. Well why don't you go chase it, then? You know, gringo, you're becoming a real pain in the ass. You might wanna have that checked out by Dr. Wade when you get back there. Could be something serious. It's gonna be serious when we find that Chinaman, huh? For you. I figured that's why you ain't discussed my fee yet. Too dark now. Let's set up camp. Camp? We just found his tracks! Hey, we'll follow him now. Maybe you missed the part about it being dark. I can't track what I can't see. Camp. Get away. Evenin'. Looks to me like we're behind schedule. What do you expect? Chinese doing all the work. I expect when I pay good money for a job that it oughta be done when I need it done. Speakin' of pay. You owe me on my draw. I got mouths to feed too. You're lucky I need those tracks. Pleasure doing business with you. Did you hear that? Where? Spread out, spread out, dammit. You hungry? Nah. So what's your plan, son? Who said I had one? Well you just gonna keep killin' men till you get the one you're after? Mm-hmm. I was hoping the one I was looking for was with you. You know Walker's son, too lazy a pig pen. You really think he can come out here lookin' for you? Now his father, his father's men. That's a whole lotta guns to go up against for a lone man. Man you after's the kinda man that hides behind other men. They ain't stoppin' till you're dead. I'm already dead. What are you gonna do with that? I haven't really decided yet. But I need you to stand down. Do it. Send me to my family. Why don't you walk away from this, son. There's nothing in it. Son of a bitch, never right place when I need it. Why don't you help me? What you want me to do, son? Just send him a message. I can do that. Whoa. Ho. What in the hell happened here? The hell you think happened? Where the marshal? Should be at his house up on the hill. Damn. You stay here. Give me that rifle, Ben. Don't you ever listen to me, James? The Chinaman. Well he went to us like a hot knife to butter, didn't he? Did you lose one? Couldn't find a body when the sun come up. Wolves I'm guessin'. Well you're the tracker, was it wolves or not? Well after seein' what I saw, wasn't gonna stick around to find out. How is it that you're still alive? Well he wanted me to deliver a message. Which is? I reckon you're lookin' at it. If you just would've listened to me and let me take Danny and Frank to hunt this man down we wouldn't be having this conversation with a half-wit tracker. Well, you certainly right about that, boy. You wouldn't be having this conversation, because you'd be dead. Did you speak to him? Well, more accurately he spoke to me, and he said I ends with him. Then I believe your services are no longer required. Put it away. Now. You'll be joining us for supper. We need to talk about the details of what you saw. The more I know about this man, the better. Well, I appreciate it, sir. But you know, I done my job. I best be gettin'. No. I insist. Kinda figured you would. To your health. You seem a bit nervous, tracker. Well. I don't feel nervous. Bit tired I guess. What can you tell us about this man? Where you want me to start? Start with anything that'll help us find him and kill him. Well I can tell you from what I seen, that will not be easy. But I guess you already know that. That's why I'm here. Do you think he'll ever stop? When he's dead. Sit down. Sit down. We're gonna listen to him. Would you stop, boy? Would you stop? Would you if they tried to rape your pregnant wife? Would you? What about they beat her to death with their bare hands, boy? Huh? What about they took your future away, would you, would you? Somebody tried to rape your pregnant wife? Would ya? Excuse us. Little pussy. Get in there. I didn't know! What you mean you didn't know? Difference would it make if you had known? I told you before. You better be ready to go all-in. You ain't got the guts. There's blood on my hands too. Forgive me. You're still holding onto your god! You think he can save me? You're beyond saving. But that's my failin', not his. I'm done with you. Boy's always been troubled. Needs some God in his life. He resists. After today, and given the fact that I don't trust you, I think it'd be best you left town. Tonight. Well I best get a head start on that leavin' then. I'll ride with ya, so you don't change your mind. Whoa. It doesn't look like you brought enough men. Don't you worry about it. I can get more. Shh. I got ya now, China boy. Shoulda picked up that gun that day in the street. It's a shame you did so much and accomplished so little. Come on, let's get outta here. Go, go, go, go! Ain't safe here, son. They gonna be back. More guns. And they gonna keep comin' back. I'm counting on it. You can leave. Oh I can, can I? It seems I done too much of that already. And while I appreciate that, I got no other place to be. I don't even know your name. My daddy gave me Christopher King. But my friends call me Chris. You know it's customary you give your name back. Jing Phang. Well it's a pleasure to meet ya, Jing Phang. Son of a bitch, son. Let's get you fixed up. Come on now. I think I'm gonna like this place. Your woman as pretty as this shit hole? Let me make something clear to you boys. This is my town. As long as you're in my town, you're gonna treat my people with respect, or you'll end up in jail or swingin' on the end of a rope. Yes sir, Marshal sir. Am I gonna regret hirin' you? We'll get the job done. All right. You see anything? Why only one? Yeah. That's all you need if there's only one man you want dead. Who you tryin' to kill? You ask a lot of questions, don't ya? I apologize about that, son. What about you, you got family back in China? Brothers, sisters? No. You? Baby brother named Porter. Mom and Dad died young, so he's more like a son, but that boy's special. Where is he now? In a hole, next to his mama and his daddy. This Colt right here, last piece of him I got. And I tell you somethin', this son bitch woulda fired when it's supposed to, maybe it'd be him sittin' on these steps having this conversation. That bullet, it's meant for you, isn't it? Well I tried convincing of that for a while, but seems that bullet got other plans. It don't matter, though. Can't hide from it forever. It'll come home when it's ready. They all dead. He came at us like a wild bobcat. Took out three of our men. I didn't sign up for this. You say you want to bring down one guy. You're gettin' paid to do a job. You're not paying us enough for this. We had a deal. Unless you wanna be a fool, Marshal, I'd be putting that gun away and deal with your own problem. Well hold on, gentlemen, I'll double your fare. Boy. I'm feelin' generous, gentlemen, I'll triple it. Now you're talking my kind of language. Let's go, boys. Where you think you're goin'? James? I'm going to finish what you couldn't end. No you're not. You're going back to town with me, and you're going to the church, where you'll be safe, and where you can ask for forgiveness for what you've done. Forgiveness? From who, God? I shoulda stopped you myself, years ago. Take your hands off me, old man. What would your mother think about what you've become? You don't get to mention her. I know what you did, when I was a child, I watched you beat her. You never thought I saw that, did you? Every night after you drank, her blood stained on your hands. Now you talk about the man I've become. Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? I used to look up to you. Shit, I had to, my whole life. I wanted to be you, I wanted to take control like you do. But you found God, and became the shell of a man who I once worshiped. You became weak. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. Revelation 21:4. Go be with your God. You always loved him more than me. Let's go. No one's here. Where the hell are they? Let's go, boy. It's perfect. You're perfect. Forever. Forever. Wake up! Hmm. That's it, keep him awake. I want him to see everything that is coming. Nice of you to join us. When I say I am sorry about what happened to your wife, know that I mean it from the bottom of my heart. It's a pity to think of all the fun we could've had every night, had she of been less weak. My father would've approved of this, it's a shame he's not around to see it. He would've liked that I settled our little quarrel all by myself. But I want you to watch your friend die before you return to the dust. So let's get right to that. There's an old friend. I bet you miss. Always a joker. I admire that, tracker. Do it. Shoot him! Jesus Christ. You put that steel back where it belongs. Do it. Hyah. Get up! Get up. Get up! Forever.
