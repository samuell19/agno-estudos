Chen Liang ! We need to hurry ! Hurry up ! Hey ! Damn it ! He's coming down ! Give up ! What the fuck are you doing ? Let's go ! Hey ! Stop it ! Go ! Go ! I'll do it ! He's coming ! Hurry up ! You go first ! Hey, you ! Wait ! Chen Liang ! Why only 5,000 yen ? It's much less than you said. Hey, it's only 5,000 yen. It's only 5,000 yen... - It should be 35,000 yen, right ? - Yes. It's missing 30,000 yen. - Zhao Fang ! - Coming ! What's wrong ? The subtraction should be 60,000 yen for the cell and the ID. So the payment should be 35,000. The price for the fake ID and the cell is 60,000 yen, so... No ! It's not. It's 90,000 yen. This ID is not a regular one. We acquired it from an existing person. This is a "real" fake ID. He ordered it himself, after I explained. Ah... I see. He says... you ordered it yourself, right ? Really ? I did... because he said this one is safer. I didn't know it cost 30,000 yen more ! You should've asked me first ! Fake IDs are always fake ! There's no "safe" one. How could I know that ? Would you please give him the money in advance ? He is going to work with us anyway. He is asking to have the payment in advance for the next job. When can he ? When can you work next ? - Tomorrow. - He is OK from tomorrow. - Tomorrow, both of them, right ? - Yes. - Both of you, OK ? - Yes, for sure. OK, then... Here is 30,000 yen. - Let's go. - Yes. What's your new name ? 'Liu Wei'... You've got an expensive name. COMPLICITY Li Hai came to our house yesterday. He brought a box of milk. It wasn't bad. Do you remember him ? He was a friend of your father. Mom, I have to go to work. Your grandma told him to come in, but he just stood by the door for a little while and then left. - Has grandma gone to work already ? - Yes, she has. What are you learning now ? I am assembling electronic control units. Doing things with sensors. Li Hai told us about his son. He has a good job in Beijing. But you must be better than him, huh ? He must've been surprised to hear you're working in Japan as a technical intern trainee. Yes... Do you get up early every day ? Early to bed and early to rise, make a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Is your leg OK ? Yeah, it's OK. - Hi, Liu Wei... - Yang Zheng ? My package will be delivered tonight. Could you receive it for me ? It will be between 7 and 9 PM. I bought it for Yun, because you know... Sorry, you have the wrong number. Ah, sorry ! Have some. - Any messages from Yang Zheng ? - Not yet. I've got lots of calls for 'Liu Wei'. Can I change... ? He is asking if it's possible to change the number ? No way. Where did you meet Yang Zheng ? We worked for the same company. - Where are you from ? - Henan province. I am from Beijing. Have you ever been there ? Not yet... Hi, sorry. - My phone ran out of batteries. - You are always late ! What were you doing ? I overslept... Did you check where to get the money out ? Sev... seven places, right ? No, eight. Sichuan... Beijing... Guangdong... As expected, no Henan. - What about your hometown ? - No Shandong... Pork ! Let's take this. Let me introduce my friend... Chen Liang ! - Welcome ! - Thank you ! Welcome to the pig's hell hut ! There are two kinds of pigs: the smart and the dumb. Guess what the smart pigs do in the hut ? - Study ? - Isn't it sleeping ? - Is it eating ? - Sleep ? Eat ? What are you talking about ? Smart pigs will exercise, go on a diet... If we gain weight... we will just be eaten ! Let's all be thin pigs ! - Thin pigs ! - Indeed ! Let's drink ! Hand me some of that food, that one... What is she saying ? ...we finally found a job, you asked us to find one. Would you come to the office, so we could talk about it ? Let me explain the conditions... Well... The work is in Oishida town. The salary is 160,000 yen a month, room and board included. Would you please be so kind to call me back ? Thank you. What did she say ? Tell me ! What is it ? Liu Wei, the person on your ID got a job. What kind of job ? You'd better not go ! It's too dangerous to pretend to be Liu Wei. You'll be deported immediately if they find out. Maybe it's less dangerous than stealing water heaters. Hello ! It's so hot today too. Why don't you refresh yourself with cold juice ? Excuse me ! Police. Do you have a minute ? The car is over there. Do you speak Japanese ? Hello. My name is Nagasue in the Yamagata International Association. We finally found a job. You asked us to find one. Would you come to the office so that we could talk about the details ? Let me explain the conditions... - Tomorrow would be fine for him. - Really ? Maybe it's too sudden... OK, I will call and ask them. She is gonna ask now over the phone. I am Qiu Jingwen. Nice to meet you. 'Liu Wei'. - Are you from Taiwan ? - Yes. Where in China are you from ? From Beijing... I was there last summer ! It was so hot. One of the highlights was Tiananmen Square. There is a station on both sides of it. I thought it would be a three minute walk after looking at the map, but it was more than three times as long ! Everything was so huge ! Then I went to... the Forbidden City. I thought it would take about two hours... So... How big is this company ? How many employees ? I don't know. Let me take a look. From Thursday... Just two... Sure. I will tell it to him. Probably it isn't big. What made you want to be a "SOBA" chef ? It's unusual. No Chinese people is interested in Japanese soba. - Is it a "SOBA" restaurant ? - Of course ! Fine... Chen Liang, come here ! Can I have a minute ? My relatives went to Japan to work and saved a lot of money. You can pay it back in a year. Why don't you reply ? What's your plan ? My mother is not in good health. I wonder if my mother and grandma will be all right. If you are not self-dependent, you cannot help your family. My wife will return to work soon. She is getting less busy as my baby grows. Chen Liang, maybe this is a good chance. If you don't decide, I will talk to someone else. Would you try this ? Look... This much. - Would you serve them one by one ? - Yes, I will. Put this curtain here before the restaurant opens. Yes. Like this. Put this here... Take this to table three. I said that way, remember ? - Say "Welcome !", OK ? - Yes..."Welcome". - Welcome. - Nice to meet you. I'll take it. He was looking forward to having you here. How did you know about this restaurant ? Hello, this is "Yura" Soba. Yes ? Oh. It's been a while. I've been waiting for you to come over. Yeah, OK ! Thank you. Bye ! Once I finish making soba... you deliver it to this place. Kaori ! Show him this address on the map. - Sure. - And here... In this bag is the spare change. Push like this. - Push. - Got it. Be careful. - You must be careful ! - Yes ! - But in a hurry ! - Yes ! - Hello ! - Coming ! Thank you very much. - Here is the soba. - Put it here. I'm still assembling electronic control units. Are you progressing ? How long have you been learning it ? Yeah, it's a difficult thing. Really ? Keep doing your best ! Yes... Have you mentioned our car repair shop to your boss ? Yes... Grandma looks forward to your progress. When you come back, you can repair cars by yourself. - Yes... - Do your best ! Lunch time is over. I have to go. OK, go back to work. - Here you are. - Thank you. Liu... It takes a long time to become a good soba chef. - Hang in there. - Yes... Let's eat. Thank you for the food... Enjoy your meal. Help yourself ! It's written on your C.V. that you're from Beijing. Are you ? Yes. - Hey, Kaori... - What ? - You cut too big... - Yeah, this is my specialty. So now, Beijing is a... big city full of skyscrapers. Isn't it ? I wanna revisit Beijing before I die. Dad was born in Beijing. But it was just when I was a baby. I don't remember well. Liu, here... My brother left these clothes. You can wear them. Ah... thanks ! Thank you so much. This room's ceiling is very low. Sorry about this. Dad cleaned the room very carefully. You can use the living room, if it's too cramped. Understand ? Feel free to use it. See you tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. I am sorry. Don't oversleep tomorrow morning ! Put that bag... over there. That bag, there ! - OK ? - Yes. - This one. - Yes. No, no. You'll hurt your lower back. Look at me. Hold it from here, like when carrying a baby in your arms. - OK ? - Yes. Grandma is old... I am not good... like this. If you go to Japan, how can we live ? Mom, give me three years... and I will study and work there. Then I will come back with a lot of money, we can re-open dad's shop. Then you and grandma will have a good life. It's easier said than done ! I can't believe it. If your dad were alive, he would be so angry. How are you going to explain it to grandma ? Mom... They asked me to reply by tomorrow. If not, they will choose someone else. You've been chosen already ? It's better not to tell your grandma yet ! - Shu Zhen ! - Grandma is coming back ! You haven't gone to work yet ? I am off today ! Off today ? So you should go looking for another job ! Aren't you ashamed you can't even live by yourself ? Until when can I stop taking care of the both of you ? I cannot think of it. I was not expecting to live my old age like this. Mom, stop complaining ! He is looking for a job ! You are always like that. You two are not serious ! Hello ! Hello ! It's hard to walk up, isn't it ? Must be hard to climb the stairs ? Why do you speak Chinese ? I knew it ! I am learning Chinese now. Are you going to go to China ? I don't know yet, but... If I pass the test. I am Hazuki. And you ? My name is... Liu Wei. Liu Wei ? I am hungry, Liu Wei. Hurry up ! Liu... - Can you put this at the entrance ? - Yes... Tomorrow is my mom's memorial service. - Memorial ? - Yeah... It is today, 22 years ago that my mom passed away. You see every morning my dad praying in front of her altar. Like a funeral ? Kind of. - Don't forget to put it there. - Got it. - Chen Liang, you're not eating. - Sorry ? Help yourself. They are preparing dinner at my place. He has to eat later at his job. How long are you going to be there ? Are you going to continue the job ? Chen Liang, I'm going back to China. I don't want to be here anymore. What about your debt ? Don't you want to go back ? You know there's no future in Japan. He is telling him about the job now. And Yang Zheng ? Yang Zheng is... I don't know about him... There is a job for us, which will bring us a lot of money in a night. Have you done it ? Ask him if he's interested. Are you gonna be in ? This work is really good. Some of my friends did it and earned a lot of money. Seems like he is not interested. I will talk to him later. We still have some time. You can't force him. We'll find someone else. Excuse me... Do you mind if... A lot of smoke is coming this way. We are eating. Ah ? Hey... You don't need to stop. - Excuse me ! - Yes, coming ! - Is this a non-smoking restaurant ? - It's totally OK. You can smoke. I knew it. Chen Liang, did you hear that ? We chose this restaurant, because it allows us to smoke. You can smoke here. He's just looking down on us, he thinks he's a "big deal". Don't listen to him. Here, smoke. It's OK, smoke. Excuse me, the check, please. Thank you ! I'm home ! I'm waiting for you ! Liu, here ! These futons... Would you take these to dad ? Sure ! Thank you ! Over there ! OK ! Thank you. Liu ! Yes ? Can you put away this vacuum, please ? Coming. Thank you. Hello, good evening ! Kyoko ! Hello ! Welcome ! Dad, they are here ! Long time no see, huh ? It was a long trip, right ? Ah, thank you. Come in, come in. Oh, yes ! Where is your luggage ? We left them at the hotel. Why ? You said you were going to stay here. Oh, dad, good evening ! Sorry for not being in touch for so long. You must be tired. Please relax. I've got something for you... This shop is 100 years old and... Take off your shoes already. Hurry up ! It is a very small shop. There was dining space inside but... Liu, let me introduce... my little brother, Kohki. I told you on the phone about him. Remember ? His name is "Liu Wei". Dad and I call him "Liu". Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. We should talk before dinner. All the food is already served, the sasimi as well. I came back to talk. Kyoko is waiting for us. She is OK ! - How can you say that ? - It's OK, we will finish soon. - No, we won't ! - Yes, we will ! - We need time to fix it. - No more wasting time. Why do you say that ? We just need to confirm the conclusion. - No, we should talk to each other ! - It's a very simple conversation. What's that simple conversation about ? It's time to close this restaurant. I am the one to decide when to retire. We are getting nowhere. Sis, I'm going now. Hey, wait ! We're not done yet ! Why are you always like this ? You should face dad ! No, no, he's always like that ! How are we supposed to talk ? You promised we would all listen to each other. Until when are you going to take care of him here, giving away your own life ? I'm fine here ! Why did he hire a Chinese at a time like this ? What ? Stop talking like that ! Does he need that Chinese guy ? What is he thinking ? He is not "that Chinese," he has a name of his own. His name is "Liu Wei". Call him by his name ! Sis... Isn't he strange ? No, he is not ! He works very hard ! I saw him earlier in a tavern. He was with some strange guys. Did you eat already before coming here ? Didn't I tell you we would eat together ? It's impossible to eat together in this situation ! Dad made a great effort to prepare it for you two ! Who cares ? I prefer talking than eating. Then you should first respect your father ! I don't think he is my father ! How can you say that ? - He doesn't want to talk with me. - Neither do you ! He is so selfish ! He came back only after mom died and re-opened mom's restaurant. You don't... Because you are in Tokyo... you don't know... how I've been feeling... I finished cleaning. Thank you. Liu... Why don't you... smoke here ? Sure... Thank you very much. Burn the incense, please. Liu Wei, why do you work in a soba restaurant ? What do you want to do after you master soba ? - My own restaurant. - Your own ? Where would it be ? In China. In Beijing ? Yes. Then I could work for you, because I applied for a school in Beijing. You'll be called by this number, 14. Four... Four... ten. Fourteen. - Why do you know this song ? - Finally I met a soul mate in life. - Every Chinese can sing it ! - Really ! "As long as you are with me..." "I always care about you." - Thank you. - Thank you. Be careful ! Be careful ! No, no ! You don't have to pick it up. It's OK. - Is it OK ? - Yes, it is OK. It's ready ! A small bowl, please. Cowardly boy ! You are going to leave your sick mother and go to Japan ? Are you even human ? He says he has been searching for work for a long time... but couldn't find anything at all. You said you had something to tell me. I thought you finally found one, but you are going to Japan ? Stop being a fool ! Are you the son of that brilliant father ? I think it will be good for him to go to Japan ! He is going to earn money and learn new skills. Don't be naive ! Reality is not like that ! Chen Liang, talk to your grandma. Do not be silly ! If he goes, we will be left alone, how are we supposed to live by ourselves ? He is so different from his father ! He always leaves everything incomplete ! You know it too, don't you ? I begged my friend to hire him, but he quit without saying a word. Look what he's doing now ! He's only helping his friend's wife during her pregnancy leave. And now, you're asking me for money to go to Japan ? Do you even know how much I have ? He is going to Japan to make money ! He told me he will save money and re-open his father's repair shop. Let him go ! Do it like this. No, no, no. Is it OK ? Why do Chinese often send voice messages, instead of texting ? It's faster than texting. Really ? Show me. Why were you named "Hazuki" ? Why were you named "Hazuki" ? Because I was born in August. Because I was born in August. Is that it ? That's it. - How is it written ? - Yeah. Hand me that. Leaf... "Month". In August... when ? Fifteenth. Fif... teen. I will remember. There's a local festival on that day. Shall we go together ? Yes ! Dance ! Looks good on you ! Are you having fun ? - What ? - Are you enjoying yourself ? Yes ! Are you thirsty ? - I'll buy you a drink. - Really ? - Yes ! - Thank you. - Beer ? - Yes. Two beers. - Which one ? - Corona. Do you drink a lot ? I lost... You lost what ? My wallet is missing. Oh my God, really ? We can find it. - Where are you going ? - Hurry up ! We might find it ! - Where ? - Koban ! - What is that ? - Police station ! - It's OK ! - No, it's not ! - Yes, it's OK ! - We should go to the police ! Leave it ! Hazuki ! Hazuki ! Morning ! Good morning ! Did you grind this already ? Yes, I did. Have you reported your stolen wallet to the Police yet ? - I'm sorry. - My apologies ! Liu, it's OK. Bring the new plate ! I'll clean up here. I'm very sorry ! Are you OK ? Be more careful, right ? Yes. Liu Wei, are you OK ? Why can't you respond to me ? I wanted to tell you in person. I passed the test for Beijing. I will be waiting for your reply. Chen Liang, when you come back, we will have three kids, a big family ! No way ! How can you get all the kids in this small car ? Three kids won't be a problem ! I want five kids ! By the way, what will you do in Japan ? Don't marry a Japanese girl ! I just want to earn some money to open up the repair shop again ! I might even be able to repair this clunker for you ! By the time you come back, I will have a Tesla car. Five kids will all fit in it ! You will not be able to repair it ! It's like a computer ! What is a Tesla ? Don't you know what a Tesla is ? It's a hybrid car ! No, it's not ! It's an electric car ! Oh, you are talking nonsense again ! - Like this ? - Pull it up a little. Lady, When I say "three, two, one," please look back ! Pull the veil a bit more. - Oh, that's good ! Listen to me ! - Like this ? OK ! Lady, listen carefully for my signal ! Three... two... All right ! OK, not bad, but... - One more time ? - Yeah ! I mean... Throw it a little higher ! Maybe much higher ! Bride, try to look happier ! Smile ! Yeah, yeah, that's good ! OK ! On the count of three ! Three... two... one... OK ! That's beautiful ! OK ! Very good ! Excuse me ! - Yes ? - I... Excuse me ! Coming ! Very sorry to keep you waiting... Yes ? Oh... Hiroshi has already delivered it a little while ago. Everyone is having it now... already. Excuse me, can we order ? Wait a moment, please. Hurry up ! Apologize to dad. Now ! Even soba has... It has a lifetime, too. It doesn't live forever ! Can you read it ? Go help Kaori ! Dad... I am very sorry... How do you pronounce... lifetime in Chinese ? Shou ming... Shou ming... Lifetime... - Liu ! - Yes ? Would you like to practice making soba ? - Yes. - OK ! Then, boil some water. Hot water ! One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten... Go ! You need to cool them down very well. Or they'll dissolve quickly. Watch. Liu ! A friend of yours is waiting outside. Chen Liang, it's me ! - What are you doing here ? - I have no place to stay. It's quite spacious here, so let me live with you. No, you can't ! We lived together before, didn't we ? Why don't you contact the Japanese guys ? I couldn't contact them ! What should I do ? Where should I live ? Chen Liang ! I am not Chen Liang here. Liu ! Is he your friend ? I don't think so. - Then go inside. - Yes. - Why can't you help me ? - He is working now ! I am sorry ! How did you fall down ? Did you hit your head on the ground ? No, no. Fortunately... I fell on my hands. So, are you OK ? Please be more careful from now on. I am not OK ! My knees are covered with bruises ! It must hurt ! It hurts ! By the way, Chen Liang... I sent a box of tea to your boss. I asked your grandma to buy it when she went to the city. It's a very high-quality tea ! I want your boss to take good care of you. You don't need to send anything anymore ! I sent the present so you'll get more attention. Send us another picture of you working in the office. Kaori ! We only have soba for four more people. OK, got it. Here's the soba soup. Liu, take the order from table three. OK. Welcome ! Today is the day of the festival. Who am I going to go with ? And you know it's my birthday. Where is the present for me ? What happened ? Wasn't she supposed to be healthy ? What happened ? Your mom didn't want me to tell you, but you should know this. Your grandma borrowed money from a lot of people to let you go to Japan. So after you left, she took on more work, then her condition got worse. After your grandma's death, no one will take care of her. It will be too difficult for her. How is mom now ? She is not well ! She is putting up with it by herself. She asked everyone not to tell you about grandma's death. But I think you already saved much money and learned new skills. So come back as soon as possible, at least for her funeral. Do you hear me ? Liu, clear off table five ! Liu ! Thank you ! Take care ! Liu, I will take these. Liu, are you OK ? Something wrong with you ? Hi, hello ! Welcome ! Table for three. OK, we will prepare ! Show me once more... The cremation is about to begin, I have to turn this off. Your mom may come in anytime. Take a last look at your grandma. Liu. You cannot mix it just with your hands. Use your whole body. Whole ! Whole body. Do you understand ? - Yes. - OK ! This is fancy ! Look ! Isn't it fancy ? It's too flashy. Um, this is nice ! Liang ! It's a little small. I think it's not bad ! - Let's look at jackets. - Cool. Excuse me ! Can you show me that one, the third one ? This one ? That one too, please ! This one looks good too ! I like this one ! Try this one. This ? Should he try it on ? I'll try it ! So ? Looks good on you. I can imagine you wearing this in Japan ! I always choose the right clothes ! What do you think of this one ? Very good ! You don't need to see me off. Why ? Because this is not farewell. I'll be waiting in Beijing. Are you still there ? Why don't you move on ? What did your father and mother say ? Sorry ? When you told them you would be a soba chef. Agree. You can say San Sei in Japanese. You have good parents, don't you ? You should be a good son to them. Yes, I will. Do you have grandparents ? They must be around the same age as me. They have already... passed away. I see. Did they die in China ? Soba has a strong life. It grows even if it's in barren soil. Barren soil ? I mean "even if the situation is not good". - Takahashi ! - Hey, Hiroshi ! Long time no see ! The other day... your daughter came to the restaurant along with her husband. Oh, they did ? Your grandson is very cute ! He's a naughty boy. Oh, your son ? He is a natural at making soba. Really ? How's the soba growing this year ? Liu. Softer, OK ? Kaori ! Kaori went shopping. Oh, really ? Hello. Yes, that is me. Yes, but is there any problem with it ? That's quite impolite. There's no such person here. His name is Liu. Liu Wei. You should've confirmed the information before calling. Oh, that was too strong. Look here ! Then use your hands. I cannot answer your call right now. You can send a fax or... please leave your message after the tone. This is Nakamitsu again. I just called you. I will send you his ID card by fax. Please check it. Now receiving a fax. Liu, I'm sorry, but please show me your passport. What is... your name ? I don't know ! Did you lie to me ? I'll be in trouble with the Police because of you. Show me your passport ! Show it to me ! Change into these clothes after you get to Japan. Mom, before taking your medicine ask grandma to check the bottle, to make sure it's the right one ! Don't mistake it ! All right ! Don't worry ! Grandma will check it for me ! I will. Don't worry ! - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. We just came to see him. Don't worry, brother. I'm here. If your mom and grandma need anything, just give me a call, and I'll come immediately ! - If you need anything, let me know ! - Thank you, thank you. Grandma, I don't need a sewing kit ! This is yours ! - Take it ! My good boy ! - Take it back ! Take it ! What if you have any problems ? You will need this when a button comes off. - The bus is here. - Yes, this is it. - I'm going now ! - OK ! I'm going now ! Take care ! Call if you need anything ! Grind that. Yes. Sorry to keep you waiting. Who ordered the large one ? Here you are. Is it your first time here ? Where are you from ? - From Sendai. - Really ? - I brought her here. - Of course I remember you ! Thank you, and enjoy our soba ! Oh, why are you here ? - Oh, Haru... - It seems you need my help. Not today, thank you. He is now practicing. He can't focus if a pretty girl like you is here. - Pretty ? Am I ? - Yes, of course. I would ask you out if I were him. I will go prepare it, excuse me. I will serve the meal right away. I am sorry. Dad ! I'll do the delivery. Thank you for the meal. Kaori... This is Liu's first soba noodles. It's just like himself. I have to give it to him, it's not bad for such a short time. Yes. Kaori, I know about... I know you are constantly renewing your passport. You caught me. I wanted to tell you... during your mom's memorial service, but... I will close the restaurant for a little while. I want to use that time to teach Liu intensively. So, during that time off, you can go... wherever you like. Use your new passport for the first time ! But, will everything be all right here ? You and Liu alone. Liu... I hope you can be my dad's right hand soon. Yes, I will. Thank you. Dad... dad... It's time for bed. Hazuki... Good morning. Dad... dad ! - What ? - A black cat is here ! Is the school starting now ? How is that ? Liu, I can't touch cats. Me neither, dad. I cut soba for the first time by myself a few days ago. Here you are. Tell me anything you need. I will bring it to you. Thank you. In about 30 seconds. Practice makes perfect. I got it. - Clear off the table. - Sure. Liu, please stand in front of the pot. What ? Just like you're boiling soba over there. Where are we going ? I'm a happy man... I'm a happy man... I've never won like that ! It's amazing ! Liu... Do you drink alcohol ? Yes, I do. What do you like ? Soba alcohol ? Yes. - It's delicious. - Yeah, it's good. - Is this you, father ? - This is me. - And this ? - This is the Chinese girl next door. I heard our families were very close. My mother had trouble breastfeeding me, so this girl's mother shared her milk with me. Then I was able to grow up. Even after coming back to Japan... my mother always talked about how grateful she was to her. - Is that so ? - Yeah. This... this is "Yi-wa-en". Yi-wa-en ? Oh, you don't understand... Hand me that notepad. Good thing we have the same characters. Ah, Summer Palace ! - "Yi... hu... yen". - Yi-he-yuan. I hope you could go to Beijing sometime "for real". Why don't you open a Japanese soba restaurant in Beijing ? There's a lot of expats living there. I think that would be nice. Yes. Who is this ? This is my father. Dad's father. Grandfather. Yeah, grandfather. You've learned a lot of Japanese. You don't look like... Like whom ? Like dad here. This... This is the same person. It's me. This is a four-year-old kid. And 71 years later, he's got a little bit more wrinkled, but still cute, right ? A phone is ringing. Is it yours ? Yes. - Hello. - Hello, This is Fujiwara, calling from Yamagata Police. Am I speaking to Mr. Liu Wei ? Yes... Did you lose your wallet in July ? Mrs. Hazuki Nakanishi reported it stolen for you. Is this correct ? Yes... Fortunately it's found, but... one thing I need to ask you is about the ID card in it. Did you happen to buy this from someone ? No, I didn't... I see... Well, I would like to talk to you a little bit about this anyway. Could you spare some time ? Yes... I know you work for a soba restaurant in Oishida town. - Would you like us to visit you ? - No ! I will come... OK, then I will be waiting for you tomorrow. What are you doing ? Come on in ! Sit down ! Was it your girlfriend ? That's nice, to be young... - Dad... - Yeah ? Shall we open a soba restaurant together in Beijing ? Huh ? Really ? That sounds really good ! Today, about 12,000 Japanese live in Beijing. Here there're only 7,500. There are more Japanese over there. It will be a good business. When it happens, you will be the chef, and I will be your assistant. - Does that sound good ? - Really ? Really ! Oh, I don't know why I am crying... Here is the change. Thank you so much ! Take care ! There are few customers today. Yeah, it's OK. Little by little. We are now serving limited meals a day. When the soup runs out, we will close. Like in a ramen restaurant. Who is ringing the doorbell ? You don't need to ring the bell. Please come in. Do you have a minute ? Let's talk outside. This way. Sorry for interrupting. We are looking for a young Chinese man named Chen Liang. He is here, isn't he ? If you are harboring him, we are going to have to ask you some questions. He is here.
