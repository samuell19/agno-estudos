This film was restored by PATHÉ in 2017 PORTRAIT OF INNOCENCE Gallop! Gee up! Come on! Gee up! Shaky. gee up! Come on, Butterfly! Gee up! Gallop now! Going to Marseilles, sir? Yes. You know, I had a telegram yesterday to say my wife was giving birth. - So I took the coach. - You had to. Look at the scenery. It's so beautiful! You said it. The mountains are splendid. Oh, the joys of travel... You can't imagine it at home. Gee up, you idlers! They're asleep on their feet! He's not down here! Will we be attacked? Fear not, my dear lady. I have two loaded pistols. I don't know about you, but fresh air makes me hungry. I brought some chicken. Would you like a bit? Only if you can spare it. Of course! Here. Have a thigh. You're very kind. I'm peckish too. So am I. I have some ham. Me, two herrings. Coachman... Lamb for you both. Thank you. Gee up! - Gee up! - Don't we eat? It's always the same. We slave and starve. Shut up, you nags! Horses don't speak. Gee up! Put four men under Iron Arm. - Hurry. - Yes, boss. After eating, they'll be drowsy. That's when we attack. Charlie, I never brag. As for women... I'm the very same. But if I set my sights on a woman, she's the one I'll have. It's funny how alike we are. Look at that one. Gee up! Gallop, Shaky! Gee up, Butterfly! Pierrot! Pierrot, run an errand. No, Mariette. I'm the coachman. Hurry, before school starts. No, we might even get attacked. You can't? I'm not allowed. I'm busy. Not attacking the coach? I'm no good at that. I don't need kids' games. Look who's here. Hello, Mariette. - Mariette... - Yes? You're looking really pretty. - Know what you need? - Tell me. A nice fellow like me to court you. And I thought you were smart. Take a look at yourself. Good bye. You know how to talk to women! Experience. Poor thing. Leave her be. She's hungry. I'll teach her life if she doesn't know. Did my brother pay for the paper? Yes, Miss Mariette, he did. Still as busy? With all these crimes... By the way, I've found who murdered the Durandard couple. What a case. I won't take up your time. Goodbye. Good bye. My advantage over the police is the personal side to my method, see. When I study a good crime, I put myself in a state of intuitive receptiveness. Like this. I see the killer instantly. Then stage two. The facts have to confirm my initial intuition. And they almost always do. Because... Forgive me, inspector. I have a report for you on the Durandard case. Mr Finot, the third this week. I'll soon have one on the Hotel Michaud case. Excellent. Good luck. Thank you, inspector. - You appear from the ground? - Now and then. I'm armed to court you. That's very kind. Most suitors don't do this. Flowers for a florist... What? Do you have suitors? As many as the pupils in your class. From today, you should reject those boors. They're so sweet. Mariette... Let's talk about our country outing. Tomorrow? You know I can't. I'm lunching with the inspector. It's a real nuisance. The inspector has a pretty daughter, Léopoldine. You never mentioned her. Never mind. I have next week off. Choose any day. Monday, perhaps. If you're not having lunch. Hello, Miss Mariette. ls my order ready? - Yes, sir. - I'll come back. Excuse me. Gee up! Come on, lads! Gee up! Here they come! The swine! Snow White! Snow White! Give her back! Give me Snow White! - Give me Snow White! - Get lost! - You're dead. - Not true. - It is. - No. You're dead! Time for school. Come on. It's time. Stop that, we'll be late! The ball! The ball! What's this? The ball! Boys' school Who committed this act? Who is the culprit? - Don't move. - Stay here quietly. Must I impose a collective punishment? What are you doing here? Run along. You again, Nicolas Lemoine. My compliments, my boy. You destroyed the yard tap and a coat stand. You also broke a window in Mr Morin's classroom. But it wasn't enough. You have greater ambitions. You wanted this transom too. And you've done it. Well, this is the last straw. Understand? Your exploit establishes the punishment. Do you know the proverb? "You break it, you buy it." Think on it. Gentlemen, gather your pupils. Headmaster... I apologize. Nicolas Lemoine is my pupil. His case is annoying, but the punishment is harsh. No, he's a troublemaker. That transom is worth 1,800 francs. But is he the only one responsible? Too bad. I can't waste my breath on a whole group of pupils. They'd have laughed in my face. But he won't laugh. The poor boy won't want to. His classmates are allowed to share his burden. I know them. They won't care. It's his fault all right. Sit down. Open your exercise books. Problem. Drat... - Before the Easter holiday. - That's new. He was supposed to read to us. Silence. A shopkeeper replaces the glass of his window that measures 2.75 metres by 6 metres. Calculate the cost given that a watch glass with a diameter of 10 centimetres would cost, if it were as thick as this glass, 3.5 francs. Remember the glass is convex. You're right. - What have you got? - 1,800 francs. Me too. Nicolas can't pay that. He'll get hell at home. - Have you finished? - Yes, sir. - Rozet, what did you get? - 1,800 francs, sir. That's right. That's it. - It's expensive. - Yes, it is. The shopkeeper must be upset. And now some reading. A tale: "Delphine had a commendation and Marinette the prize. The teacher embraced them, taking care with their dresses. The vice-prefect who came from the city in his embroidered uniform made a speech. 'Children', he said, 'education is a good thing. Those without are unfortunate. Luckily, that's not your case."' It's bad luck. 1,800 francs in one go. I can't imagine having to tell my folks. How many sous in 1,800? Hold on, it makes... - It makes 36,000 sous. - 36,000 sous! A lot of barley sugar, Doudou. There you are. - What is it? - We get serious over the holiday. We'll get revenge. Sorry, Torn Mix, your attack earlier was hopeless. Why was it hopeless? Wrong plan. I'll show you how to attack a coach. Think you can make a better chief than me? We saw the Tom Mix gang at work. And you chickens? Chicken or not, get even. - Tomorrow morning? - All right. - Nicolas? - Yes, Mum. - You look odd. - Not at all. So, you're on holiday. As if he needs a holiday. He has two days a week off! I hope you'll keep busy. You could answer when I talk to you. I wanted to tell you, this afternoon at school... What have you done? Nothing, I... But this afternoon at school... What happened? A transom... A transom costing 1,800 francs. The ball hit the transom. It has to be paid for. Who has to pay? Jouffroy, in another class. He gave me a scare. If it had been you, you needn't have come home. - Of course. - It could have been. It'll happen one day. - I don't know what you'll do later. - Nothing good. Stay there. I'll put you on the straight and narrow. If you won't listen, too bad. You're ripe for borstal. You hear me? Stubborn as a mule. Get the hell out now! Fetch milk instead of standing there. Here's Nicolas. Hey, Nicolas. How did it go? They were angry before I spoke. You couldn't tell them? I said another kid broke it. I still got told off. They said I'd never come to any good and I'd end up in borstal. I'll have to run away one day. If only we could help you. No one can help. I have an errand to run. He's right, no one can help. That's too easy to say. Let's tell the others. - Good idea. - Let's hurry. This is from Laurent. "All good men to the waste lot." It's provocation. We'll show them who the good men are. They wanted revenge. Defeat stings. They can't match us. They're riled. They think it's to fight. They won't play along. You wanted good men. You seem less nervous now. - But you should be. - Give it a rest. We're not here for the attack. This is about Nicolas. Nicolas? What about him? You've forgotten the transom. But he can't forget it. He tried to tell his folks about it. He couldn't. When he mentioned the transom, his dad said if he did it, he needn't come home. It's nasty, but what can we do? We can help him out. We could all chip in. 1,800 francs is quite a sum. We'd all help out. Others kicked the ball. But he aims badly. Say I broke the glass. You did. - And me. - All of us. It could've been anyone. I can shoot. How about your sister? - My sister... - Keep it polite. The day I tore my shorts, Nicolas mended them for me. Your torn shorts only concern your behind. But when a ball smashes a window at school, it concerns the whole class. You agree too now? Yes. I don't chicken out if a pal needs me. I couldn't either. Nicolas is in your gang. When my dad slaps me, would you replace me? He doesn't understand. We're talking about loyal friends. The others can go. Who needs them? I was just saying... Enough talk. We're in or we're not. Those who want to help Nicolas, hands up. It's that simple. All right then, let's pass the cap. I'll empty my pockets. My duck. 17 sous and my top. - What are you hiding? - My knife. Hand it over. Hurry up. It's like charity week. All your change. Let's go. Hand over your change. It's for Nicolas. Well, Mr Castor? Give us a good price to help a friend. Don't worry, boys. My business is known for never making a profit. I pay a high price for everything and sell it all cheap. To do you a favour, I'll give you 20 francs for the lot. - More! - It's not much. - Here. - Is that your final offer? Of course. - I'm out of pocket already. - Too bad then. - Mr Castor. - Yes? How much for my duck? It's a fine piece... I can go up to 3 sous. Well, lads? We only got 20 francs. 20? That's not going to help Nicolas much. You expected 1,800 by emptying our pockets? It'd be too easy. What now? - How do you get money? - Ask your parents. No. When you want money, you work. He's right. - Let's work. - At what? We'll think all night and start tomorrow. - Who'll be the banker? - You. - Yes. - Of course. I'll organize all that and find a cash box. You talk like a teacher. He talks like a friend. Follow his example. No, really, René. Aren't you sweet on Léopoldine? Mariette. You know very well... - Well... - Yes. Eat with your inspector tomorrow. All right. I'll go. Don't feel obliged. I can cancel. I was joking. For our outing, would Monday suit you? Where will we go? It's a surprise. There... First, above our heads, a sky like you've never seen. A very gentle blue. Very tender. - I want a little cloud. - You'll have it. Hey. Gégène! It's your uncle. Drat! I bet they'll manage it. In a week, 30 or 40 kids can rake in a lot of money. Worth watching them, isn't it? The poor kid. A tender heart? Breathe, it'll pass. Here's her brother. So, Rozet, you're all working? That's kind. I like to see boys with a heart. I bet you'll do it. - I'm sure we will. - Of course. - Is Mariette well? - Yes. I see your teacher with her. Do they want to get wed? Not that I know. - I'd be sad for you, Rozet. - Why? A teacher... Don't you realize? All day in class is a lot. But having him at home too? Over dinner, he'll suddenly ask, "When was the Battle of Gravelotte?" If you get it wrong, he'll have to punish you. I know the type. My uncle was a schoolteacher. I never thought of it. You should, my boy. - It mustn't fail. - Why would it? - Any ideas for work? - Yes, loads. Not everyone's like you. - What do you mean? - Don't start again. Rozet, just the man. Wait here. I'll baptize the cash box. Hello, Mum. - No errands? - No, Jeannot. All right. Jean, want to play with us? Yes, I'll play. Here's how to get money. Take a hammer, aim at the middle... and pick up the money. You didn't know that trick. No money. No money? The little bird... He isn't dead. Any money? No money. - Here's money. - I see money. Give me your money. What have you rascals done? - Jeannot showed us how to get money. - Jeannot? - Yes. - Give me that. What's this? You tell me. What's this money and these betting slips? You bet on horses? Not systematically. Only on a safe one. At your age? I won't stand for it, Ernest. Why did you take the money from your piggybank? For Nicolas. What's this nonsense? It's not nonsense. He broke a transom worth 1,800 francs. He has to pay. So all the lads are helping out. I prefer that. Hear that, Ernest? He's not spending it on the horses. Here. Nicolas needs it more than the bookies. Mariette? What, dear? Are we getting married to Mr Morin? What an idea! Certainly not. If we did marry him, would he give me problems? Why would he give you problems? Problems or essays or who knows what. Understand? A teacher... Don't worry. If he mentions marriage, I'll set our conditions: no extra problems or homework. You know, I like Mr Morin. If he wants to marry, accept. If you say so. Here. This is for your money. Thank you. I'll take it this afternoon. Nicolas. I was just looking for you. We got together yesterday. - And... - And what? Hello, sir. - Dad... - What? - Can I take 10 minutes? - Shirking again? We don't have time. Idler! Move. Here you go. Daily meeting How are things? What're you going to do? I don't know yet. Come and sing with us. I don't fancy that. What I need is... Well, I'll see. Let's go. One, two, three... - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you, sir. 20 sous each. Peace for kids, fun for parents. 20 sous. 1 franc each. Peace for kids, fun for parents. Don't play with that ball here. What's he up to with the notary's kid? He teaches him slang at 5 francs a lesson. That's going to work? This is thatch. Your bonce. Thatch on your bonce? - What's that? - Hair on your head. - Yes, pal. - And feet are trotters? Yes, trotters, hooves or dogs. Or even paws. In the morning, you put your trotters in your clogs. If someone mashes them, what do you say? Watch it, berk! Stay off my turf. - You said it. - Enough for today. - I'll split. - Ok. - Tomorrow at 5 bells? - Got it. - Gimme the dosh. - Here. We're all set. See you around. Help a fellow out, ma'am. Help a fellow out, sir. Got any tips for us? How do we go about begging? Shame on you, joking about that! Clear off! Help a fellow out. Are they your children, my poor man? Yes, my grandchildren. Three of them. I have 12 in all. Here. - We'll clear off. - Hold on. Let's do a deal. All right, I get it. But we share. Stand over here. Help a fellow out, please. Madam... Buy the appliance. The perfect curler. Home curling. The best appliance ever. 100 sous. Just 100 sous. 100 sous. This appliance is the most... This simple, solid model in Indian steel, offered to you as a family productivity bonus for the trivial sum of 3.5 francs is used by the princesses of Europe and Hollywood. I see a young girl among you ladies who owes her charm and beauty to Dr Jabot's technique. Step closer, miss. Fear not. - Me? - Yes, step closer. Climb up here. Ladies and gentlemen, this girl's story is simple and touching. At birth, her straight hair dismayed her parents. So they decided to try our perfect curler. Observe the amazing results. Thanks to this appliance, a young girl's hair is permed for life. For life, ladies! Imagine that! Roll up. 3.5 francs only. Perm your own hair. Sir, 3.5 francs. Change your style, ladies. Look like a movie star! Not too much wax. I only use the best products from America. How did I get so muddy? Same here. What happened? Treat your shoes to my wax! Get a shine on them! Roll on up! Imagine, 1,800 francs. We need every sou. We'd have already made 1,000 by now. Parents are never logical. 800 or 1,800, Nicolas would be in as much trouble. With luck, you'll get the money. We'll need luck. Count on yourselves first, rather than on luck. But you can try for luck too. Here. I'll give you a lottery ticket. But forget it. You have one chance in 1,000. But it's one tiny extra chance. The draw is this week. I'll check it. I have the number. Thank you, sir. Even though it's dry, our shoes get muddy. - Here. - Thank you. Keep the change. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - See you soon. He was nice. Even teachers can be normal sometimes. I'm glad we've met. Seen this masquerade? These kids yelling... Shameful for the school. A shoeshiner, a street vendor... It's a way of passing the holidays as good as any other. Mr Morin, don't you realize they're compromising the school's reputation? Frankly, I don't think people see that. Oh, by the way, have you seen this new automaton? Not very interesting. What will they come up with next? I'm sorry, I must be going. I fear I'll be late for lunch. Did you step in a puddle? Oh, heavens! I have a lunch too. Your luck's in. There's a shoeshiner there. Goodbye, old chap. I can't listen to you now. You've nothing new to say. Mariette, be nice. Understand me. As a couple, you'd sell flowers and I'd make a living. We'd meet up at home for nice meals. We'd see a movie at night. We'd play cards in the local café. And then home to bed. Don't be a nuisance! Careful, Mariette. If a woman treats me right, I'm the kindest of men. But if you cross me... Getting nasty now? You won't manage to scare me. Your sweetheart will save you? What a joke. Shame on you, seeing a teacher. We'll talk about that again. He brought me to see this. Look at this thing. - Is this automaton anything special? - Lord, no I think that florist has poor Morin at sixes and sevens. It'll all end badly. - Gilbert. - Cinema. - Robert. - Cinema. - Paul. - Cinema. - Maurice. - Cinema. - Georgette. - Cinema. - Victor. - Cinema. - Louis. - Cinema. Not me. My mum said she'd take me to the cinema herself. Too bad. You know, lads, we hand over our cinema money, but our parents will ask us what we saw. Easy, we'll pick one of us to see the film and tell us all about it. Doudou, close your eyes and point to the list. - Lucien Collard. - I'm going tonight with my mum. You've been picked now, so you obey. Yes... I was careful, inspector. I can imagine, a blunderer like you. What a Sunday. A burned roast, a sleepy guest, my wife upset, and it doesn't end. Sir... By the way, who are these kids yelling at every street corner? No idea. I fill you in again. Stir yourself! I want the whole mess cleared up 15 minutes from now. Give me a light. How'll we get the money now if we can't work? We work without the police catching us. We need another solution. That won't alert the police. So find it, wise guy. We'll find it. If not, we let Nicolas down. I'd rather sell my shirt. We could pick lily of the valley in the woods. That'd bring in money. My sister would buy some and we'll sell the rest. Not a bad idea. The police might be a problem. How could we go about it? We have time to think. The first idea is the best. So find the first idea. Here's the key. Keep it. No, that's not the way it happens. I've asked around. I have the box, you the key. All right then. Did it go well, lads? Is the box full? Not yet. It's early days. Too bad the coppers stopped us. The coppers don't have a say. We've changed plans. We'll pick lily of the valley. That's a good idea. I'll give you tips to sell it. Here's Collard. So, how was it? What did you see? They were showing Camille. Tell us. He can tell us on the car. Let him climb up. Shut your mouths! He'll tell us Camille. Nice! All right. It's about a certain Marguerite. All the men love her. You too maybe? At first. Maybe a little. I'm too flighty for it to last. Where was I? Yes, she loves a chap called Armand Duval. They see each other, they kiss. Like they're about to marry. But old Duval thinks Marguerite isn't right for his son. So, after... Well? Well, I'd rather tell you right away... That's when I dozed off. Very clever! You shouldn't have. It's not right. How'll we know? Imagine it, he dozed off! - Honestly. - And the money we gave him. Yes, our money. Our money! Hold on! I woke up. She was dying. Why did she die? A nasty bout of flu. She had problems with her uncle or someone. It wasn't much fun. I have to see it again tonight. - Was there another film? - Yes, a western. With a great horse chase. Good health, Mr Briochet. You know your way here now. Once you marry, I hope... Fernand, say hello to Mr Briochet. - Hello, sir. - Young man. What a fine boy. He's grown a lot. His father's spitting image. Had some fun? He was at the cinema. Tell Mr Briochet what you saw. - Camille. - That brings back memories. - Remember? - Excuse me. So, tell us about Camille. Take us back. Let me see. It's set in the past. It's about Marguerite. Marguerite... She dances in her old uncle's bar. Her old uncle? - You mean the duke? - Yes. There's the sheriff... That's Armand Duval. Armand Duval is the cowboy, the sheriff's son. What? He rides up one night and enters the bar, shooting, and kidnaps her. Armand Duval's father, the sheriff, chases his son with the duke. The sheriff gets ahead, grabs him and puts him on his horse. When the duke finds Marguerite, she has married Armand Duval. So he dies. How about that! Those film people, doing that with Camille! - Profaning a masterpiece. - What a nerve. Let's eat. Could you help? Thank you. Go on, Mariette. All right: no problems, no compositions and permission to go out to play. Those are our conditions. Accepted . You accept too quickly. Really? I have some fine problems. And I won't give up so easily. Not too complicated? No. Something like this one. A train runs at 50 km an hour. With the wild roses in bloom and young calves in the meadows, what are the passengers thinking? Fascinating. Now let's hear your conditions. I surrender unconditionally. Feet and fists bound. You trust me that much? Yes, Mariette. I'm happy. I'm so happy. I have to tell you. I only thought of Pierre and his future. I never thought happiness would find me. Now here it is. René. René, say something. You keep piling up blunders! Sorry, but you... Of course, it's all my fault. See what's going on now! Shut up! What is all this? - I'll tell you, sir. - I didn't ask you. Officer? Inspector, they were selling lily of the valley in a terrific din. A din? We were just being nice to the customers. That's how you obey my orders? You're all mad. They certainly are. We grabbed two and they all followed. We had to support our pals. Shut up. And you let them invade my office? We couldn't hit them... As for you, I want this to cease. I'll take sanctions, understand? Now get out of here. Be gone with you. I don't agree with any of this. Damn it, will you obey? We'll stay here until you understand, sir. If you don't clear off right now... Do you know what this is called? Rebellion. Rebellion or not, we're determined. Get that into your skull, sir. My Skull? What are you determined about? We're determined. If we all agree on what we want and all stand together, without wishing to offend, inspector, no inspector can stop us. - We'll soon see. - Sir, if I may... I know my job. Now get the hell out. - Come on. - It's not fair! It's not fair. It's for a friend in trouble. He owes 1,800 francs for a transom and doesn't have a sou. His parents are so strict, if they find out, they'll send him to borstal. We're working to help. We don't sell lily of the valley for fun. You'll quote me the rules. The rules don't foresee this. You always put me in an awkward situation. Aren't you touched? No heart, no sense... - I'm touched. - Inspector... What they're doing moves me deeply. Provoke me and I'll send my men to sing with them. We'd never ask. Ask me for nothing. You won't obtain permission because I can't give it. - But I can turn a blind eye. - Thank you, sir! Here, for your lady. For luck. Very sweet. And this curling appliance with instructions. If ever she needs a slang lesson, it'll be free. I won't say no. In slang, you're the fuzz. - I know. - Long live the fuzz! Long live the fuzz! Flowers, ladies. Flowers, gents. 20 sous to bring you luck, sir. If it brings luck... Get your lily of the valley. For luck! A bouquet for the lady's hat? Flowers, ladies. Flowers, gents. Who doesn't have lily of the valley? Two francs for lily of the valley for luck. Two francs, sir, for luck. - Just two francs, sir. - No! Two francs, for luck. Leave me be! Cheapskate! We'll finish it later. How about that... I need to see their box. I think the lid has a big ink stain on it. Yes, here in the corner. Not bad though. We need to find the same padlock this afternoon. Yes. If they don't get the money, it'd be too bad after all this. They'll get it. Just think. 900 each... We'll go to town. Got your 10 francs for my kitty? You'll get your 10 francs but stop bothering me. Your kitty! Mr Finot. - Inspector. - Paris Soir. Here you go. A fine crime today. Read about it. Good. Read my report? A masterpiece of logic and perspicacity. - You'll go far. - Thank you, sir. Good bye. Too kind. My 10 francs? All right! That report was pretty well written. Here you go, your ten francs. - You and your kitty. - Thank you, uncle. Hi, lads. What'll you have? My treat. Waiter! I'll be right back. Waiter! - Mr Morin! - Yes. - Got a minute? - Yes. Let's talk over here. It's about Mariette. Miss Mariette Rozet? I call her Mariette. We're good friends, see. - But... - I don't like to meddle. But, with Mariette, I feel I need to step in. - What do you mean? - She's wrong for you. - Believe me... - Spare me your reasons. - Goodbye. - You're scared. But you need to know. When you began chasing after Mariette she and I were almost engaged. We'd even gone a little further. I'm not interested. No harm in it. We liked each other, so who can blame us? But then you turned up. She saw you coming. A civil servant with a good job and a nice pension... But feelings remain feelings. Yours don't seem worthy of trust from the little I see. We'll see about that. You're not smart enough. And, next time, I may be less patient than I was today. You really don't want a hand? Waiting for customers isn't tiring. The kind of job I need. We'd be pressed tenderly together in here. I'd whisper sweet words. I'd be your Gaston. If I take an assistant, it won't be you. Really? I know who. I can see his calf-like face and prissy manners. You've hooked a fine one. He's just dandy. Just mind your own business. Don't be silly. I've waited long enough. It's time you ended it with the teacher. You're not funny. Carry on and I'll slap you. You'd abuse your weakness. I have better than slaps to make you obey. Mariette, look at my head. It's all in here. Must be pretty empty. You're wrong to cling to Mr Morin. You'll only regret it. Think it over. It's not too late. You pain! Too bad for you. What did I do wrong? You could have helped, even just picked lily of the valley. I couldn't. You never worked once. You won't help. I never said that. It all ends later today. You've been warned. Ok, I'll see. I want to help Nicolas. We'd never guess. Uncle! Uncle! Last day today Plus 10. Plus 6.95. Plus 11. Plus 2. Plus 0.5 francs. Here. - Add this. - About time. - I did what I could. - Another 20. 20 francs. We already have 1,700, without the change and the lottery ticket. That's good, lads. You've acted like real men. Better than men. 1,827 francs! In all, 1,827 francs. You didn't believe in it. It could've failed. Let's hurry to settle it with the head. I'll get Mr Morin to ask the headmaster to see us. We'll check our lottery ticket. It'd be funny if we won. Where would I be without you? It kept me awake at night. I dreamt I was taken to borstal. All we had to do was work together. See you tomorrow. Yes, 8 o'clock. - Corning? - Yes. Rozet, seen your sister? I just got back. I had a message for her. So, that's it? Yes, we even got more than 1,800. Must be heavy. Feel the weight of this, Charles! Nicolas will be pleased. I said they'd do it. - Here, lad. - We're pleased too. I bet. - What do I tell my sister? - I'll see her tomorrow. Good bye. Too bad it didn't cost 2 or 3,000 more. I could have waited a couple more weeks. I was in a hurry. - Why? - No reason. Now we have the money, I can tell you. I broke the transom. It was you? We were too stupid to realize. - And you broke it. - The money... The money... I don't care about the money! All I see is you acted like a heartless hoodlum again. And while your parents were slaving away, you smashed the transom. Then you got your pals to pay for the damage. That'll teach you! We're going to win. Maybe a million. We have to give it to our parents. No way! We'd leave for America. - On our ship, with me at the wheel. - Hello, boys. Hello, miss. Winners? I have the list. I'll get your treasure chest. You have the key? Who do you think I am? Here it is. There. - Hurry up. - Come on, we'll never go to America. Calm down. The money's gone! What? Just papers and stones. That's not possible. I locked it away when Rozet gave it to me. - Someone robbed us in the night. - How? It was in my room. The door was locked. How did the burglar get in? The window? Impossible, look. - It can't have vanished. - It's crazy. It's gone anyhow. Let's tell the others. What are we going to do, Mariette? I just don't know. Let's check the wardrobe. If you want. It's no use. Check anyway. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! I'm not accusing anyone. I just say what I know. We'll never get the money back. All that work for nothing. All that trouble. Imagine how Nicolas feels. We shouldn't have told you. Too bad. You did all you could. Don't tell your parents. - We'll find the money. - I doubt it. The thieves won't turn themselves in. I don't believe they got in through the window. - What do you mean? - Nothing. But Rozet had the box and then the money vanished. He'd never do such a thing. - Working was his idea. - Exactly. You're mad. We'll find the money. Could your uncle help? You bet. Let's go. Gégène and old Finot, great! No one plays a dirty trick like this on us! Let's see my uncle. Follow me. What a joke, them and their thieves. Would I leave my dog with a pork chop and think he wouldn't touch it? Look who's here. My sister went to the police. At that price, she could. - What? - Was the pork chop tasty? Follow me, lads. - You're so pale. - Me? You're not sick again? No, really, I feel fine. Did you eat too much, you glutton? There you are. Crook, bandit, wretch... - What now? - 1,800 francs stolen! I just heard. We have to pay for the transom. He'll ruin us. Stay there, lad! No one will pamper you in borstal. I'll show you. Come back here! It can't be a burglar, they were there. - Well? - It's simple enough. Don't rush to accuse a friend, even if it looks bad for him. Keep your trust in him. If he's innocent, your suspicions will hurt him. We want to trust him. Do the police know? Rozet's sister went. I'll go there. Don't worry, we'll find the money. My dear, you told me yourself a burglar couldn't get in. So? It wasn't my brother or me. If he'd opened the box, I'd have seen him. In that case, I see only one possibility. What possibility? Excuse me. Send him in. One could suppose you needed money and borrowed it. Nothing serious. You really think I could do that to those kids? Mr Morin. I just heard about the children's mishap. Their mishap is mine. - The inspector was accusing me. - What? I'm not accusing anyone, just sizing things up. Damn it, I have to be logical. You say a burglar couldn't have broken in. So that means your brother took it. He couldn't do such a thing. Rozet couldn't... Come on, Mr Morin. Come on. Yes. Listen, Mariette. Maybe Rozet didn't realize. Who knows what a kid can think? Maybe he was influenced. Mariette. Listen, we're trying to understand too. How can you even suspect him? The facts are troubling. Perhaps he has a transom story too that's turned his head. - Don't insist. - Mariette... Be reasonable. Let me question him. I forbid you to. Don't mention your suspicions! Will you find the money? Of course. It'll be child's play for me. I solved the Red Donkey Inn case yesterday, right in my news stand. I'll soon find your thief without visiting the scene. Maybe you should. I'll go it if makes you happy. It'll be an opportunity for you to witness a fine demonstration. - Mr Finot! - Why are you wearing a fake beard? To avoid attracting attention. The Americans never use disguises. When they tail someone, they get recognized right away. Let's not waste any more time. Let's go. "In every circumstance, the perfect detective..." "it is necessary to..." Listen. "All criminologists know a culprit returns to the scene of the crime." What do you say? It must be true. We can't hide out at Rozet's to wait. He'll probably come during the day. We have to go. Come on. I have to get into a state of receptiveness. Eyes closed, hands out like two aerials. I see him! - He sees him. - His outline is clear. A strapping man with broad shoulders, aged 45 or so, in a bowler hat. Just an outline for now, but I'll recognize him anywhere. Now, do the facts match my intuition? Did you sleep well last night? - Yes. - I knew it. You were probably drugged. Did last night's soup taste odd? Yes, I found it a little salty. Of course. Does your sister sleep with the window open? - Yes. - Yes? Perfect. Let's continue in the yard. I'll go first so that we don't damage the evidence. Stop, you idiots. It's Mr Finot. Really... You're mad. Sorry, Mr Finot. We didn't recognize you. The best compliment you could make, boys. Why were you hiding? A culprit always returns to the scene, so we were waiting. That's right. That's a principle one should never... Don't move. - A man's foot. - The thief? - Probably. - Why's he doing that? Police work, stupid. What use is it? What use? Don't worry, with that I'll find the thief. You're wasting your time. The thief isn't a size 8. More a child's size. Talk away. When we get him, you'll regret it, but it'll be too late. You make me laugh with your prints. Coming, Lucien? I don't agree with him. You might be right. What do you want? I've come to chat. I'm busy. A word about the money missing from the Rozets'... I thought you'd like some information. - Keep it. - Too bad. There was no theft. No theft? I'll come in. I hate draughts. My throat is a little fragile. Well? The 1,800 francs. It's not a theft, but a loan. - Understand? - Less and less. I've gone into business lately. I don't know how, but I needed to pay back 2,000 francs by today. You have to understand that Mariette isn't at fault. But how... When I borrowed the money from her, I promised to pay it back by tomorrow. But I can't, however I look at it. I don't believe a word. Here's what's left, with the lottery ticket you gave them. Let me see. - When did she give it to you? - Loaned it. Who cares? - When? - Keep your hair on. Yesterday evening. She swore she didn't go out. I went there at 11. - To her room? - Don't go imagining... You went as a friend? - A comrade? - Of course. Do you often call on her at night? Now you're imagining things... - I'll get the police. - That's not fair. As we can't pay the money back, they won't believe we borrowed it. It could lead to trouble. What do I care now anyway? You're troubled, but Mariette did nothing wrong. I don't dare tell you why I came. Go ahead. It's a bit tricky. Mariette is bothered, but I know you like her. Could you loan me the money for four or five days? She'd have asked, but you know her. She sent you here? You know, she's very fond of you. Thank you. Get lost. - Mr Morin. - Move it! Get out! Out! What a nerve! René, I was waiting for you. Something to ask me? I have no money on me. But... René. What's wrong with you? I can't appreciate your acting skills. You accuse Pierrot and now you're being an oaf? I'm not an oaf, but I don't know how to lie to people. Your brother is innocent. So you suspect me? I don't suspect. I know. I was stupid enough to be fooled. The inspector has turned you against me. Not at all. The inspector's smart. His daughter has a fine dowry. What about you, with visits from crooks? Mariette... He thinks we're thieves? No. He does. I saw. Like the others. Not all your friends suspect you. Some try to believe it's not us. It's kind of them to try. It will all work out. If it doesn't work out, Mariette, will we go away? Sweetheart. Shoes! One franc a pair! The most beautiful around! Roll on up! Shoes, one franc! Get the most beautiful shoes around! Roll up! Shoes, one franc a pair! Try my wax! Rub hard. Don't worry. Your shoes will look 14 years younger. Perfect. I'll tail the mystery man. If I'm not back by tomorrow, you may call the police. Be careful. I'll just do my duty. - Are you armed? - With logic and objectivity. He's leaving! Gégène, open the stand for Paris-Midi. If ever I don't return, always remember to be an honest man. Yes, uncle. We can pack up as we know what we wanted now. - Have we got him? - Happy now, Rozet? - Was it him? - A perfect match. Like fingerprints, no two are identical. - Hi. Can I get a shine? - If you want. - Nice and shiny. - Don't worry. Back at work. We just found the thief. Who was it? A guy who got a shine. We had a print of his shoes. I'm happy for you. Take it out of this. 20 francs? I'll go and change it at the news stand. It still has the mark of my teeth. You gave us a fake coin? You didn't make much of an effort. We'll settle that later. For now, I say we should get the police. Make him confess. Give him his change while I fetch them. I'll get the others to tail him. All right. What are you all doing here? I'm waiting for my girl. Me, Aunt Ernestine. Me, my oldest boy. I'm waiting to grow leaves. Me, lilac flowers. Me, mignonette flowers. - The night. - The morning. The circus. I'm waiting for the police. - The judges. - The hangman. It came as a shock when I heard what had happened. - Really? - Yes, really. And they suspected Rozet! I told Charlie, "That kid's dead honest." - Why would he take the money? - It's absurd. Mariette, we've... I'll tell you later. Poor kid. He's all upset. Do you have to pay the money back? Of course. I'd love to help. I have money. Not a lot, 200 francs. I'll find more. Thanks, but no. Still angry at me? Why? Because of my stories. I was a bit jealous. But I've realized now. No more teasing you anymore, that's all over. Is what we said agreed? We'll talk later. Don't hold your punches. Has he confessed? - I've done nothing. - We'll see about that. Where's the money and lottery ticket from? - Someone gave all that to me. - Who? Mariette Rozet. That's a lie, inspector. Last night at 11 in the yard, as agreed. You're lying, Gaston. I never went out last night. You can spare your breath, miss. I should have known he'd spill the beans. You chicken. These fine fellows will now explain how they burgled you without entering your home. The method must be pretty clever. A bit too clever. Show us. Sorry, I'm no good at putting on a show. - Shall I persuade him? - Dupuis will do it. Come, my boy. It wasn't my idea! No need to say that. Yesterday evening at 7, in the hallway of your building. Mr Finot, have you heard? Be quiet! - Why? - I'm on the trail. Well then, try not to lose it. Hurry along now. Off you go! I'm not a leader anymore. I wasn't able to see. I'm an idiot, a clod, a dope, a chump. I couldn't defend a true friend. - Take my stripes. - Are you nuts? Take your stripes and give it a rest. Even a leader can be wrong. Especially if you're not a real leader. A lad who can't see can't be in charge. So that's it? I'll take my stripes back. That's shut you up. - You won't stop me. - Cut it out. You're not fighting. - I said nothing. - Shut him up! It's all over, let's do the stagecoach. The money's found. - Really? - I'm so pleased. You're always pleased. So it's been found. I should hope so. - It doesn't make you a good kid. - All right, but even so... Getting insolent now? Don't go trying my patience. I owe you a thrashing. - Please, Victor. - All right. But we'll regret it. He plays on our kindness. Forget it this time. Sit down here and eat. You've been generous with your time and your work. I congratulate you unreservedly for showing such noble ardour. Your spirit of comradeship is worthy of your courage and your ingenuity. Your teachers are proud of you. But I never considered making one of you pay for the results of a simple accident. The transom was replaced during the holiday by the school board. As a result, my dear boys, you have the sum of 1,800 francs that you must put to use. Your teacher has suggested a school trip that could be led by him. Think about it. In the meantime, get back to work and your games. You're free now. Headmaster, meet my fiancée. What charming news. Brand-new too. We decided this minute. You weren't listening to my speech? - I'll never forgive you. - We heard you, sir. You were kind. Not too kind. Those boys were marvellous. The more you know them, the more...
