LOOKING FOR HORTENSE DIRECTED BY PASCAL BONITZER Thanks. For what, Tania? For being here. We don't see a lot of people, you know. The garden is all we have. When you'd come during the holidays, the house felt more cheerful, fresher. As if we'd rid the furniture and chandeliers of their covers. It's much too late. Let's stop it right here. What's wrong? First, the kiss comes far too late. I don't want to hear the word "covers." -Let's do it again. -No, it's useless. I'm fed up. You're fed up, we're all exhausted. We'll see tomorrow. Alright? Take a right to my place. It's OK, you can... What don't you like about the kiss scene? I don't know. -You think I've become annoying. -Not at all. I think you're charming, and you smell good. -My latest perfume. -The tabaco. Right. Can I ask you a question? -Why did you choose me for this role? -I saw you last year in The wedding. It sucked. I was so bad in that. That's true, everyone was, but you were more talented than the others. I think I was right. I think you'll be fine. Stop. Let me be clear. -I like you, but we won't have sex. -Why not? First of all, Antoine, I don't sleep with my actors, and I'm with someone. You know that. -What if you weren't? -But I am. -You're sad, Iva. -I'm getting out. -Let me drive you back. -I'll be fine. See you tomorrow. What's going on? I'm thinking. Since when? -What time did you get home? -The village is coming up. Already? How is it going? I don't know if Laetitia will be good enough. I hope I wasn't wrong about her. She's very young. I hate her. I didn't sleep well. I didn't sleep, actually. What's wrong? Why aren't you doing anything? What do you mean? I brought it up to you days ago and you still haven't done anything. Oh, that... Marco calls me every day. What should I tell him? -Are you listening? -I need some coffee. -Zorica how? -Zorica Velickovic. Write it down. She could be deported at any time. -Cereal? -With yogurt. -Who's getting deported? -No one. There's yogurt in the fridge. I know it's torture to ask your father for a favor, -which it is. -I'll do it. -Shit! -Hey! I said "shit." -Don't say that. -Let him say "shit." Will you take your fucking phone to make that fucking call to make a fucking appointment? -Not at 7 a.m. -When? I told you I'll do it. Don't yell, Mom. Dad said he'd do it. -What's wrong? -I'm fine. Can I? How do you do something when you can't? I've had to give a lecture twice when I hadn't prepared anything. I just made something up. -Something I'd used before. -Coffee, please. -Is it your turn? -Yeah? You can win in four strokes. -By moving the knight? -No, don't do that. Sacrifice your queen. The king has to take her. Then trap him with your rook. It'll retreat here. Put your rook here. Check. It goes back here. Checkmate Not bad. What's the thing you can't do, but have to? Ask my father for a favor. Thanks. -What's stopping you? -Everything. If I mess up, someone might end up in one of those immigration centers. A detention center? -Is he a foreigner? -She. Zorica... Velickovic. I don't even know if I'll be able to pronounce her name. It'll be horrible. I'll stammer, he'll look down at me. Between us, do you have a simple relationship with your father? I have a simple relationship with no one. -Especially not with my father. -But you... -Mine's dead, it simplifies things. -Not always. COUNCIL OF STATE Hello. I'm looking for someone who holds the world in his hands. Is it you? -It's not. -Do you have a dollar? -Do you have light? -Sorry, I don't smoke. -Hello, anyway. -Do we know each other? The Feathered Tree. -The Feathered Tree? -We met at the bookstore. Yes, the bookstore. Could I attend your Mandarin classes? Who told you I did those? -Your friends at the cafe. -They couldn't have. They did. I wouldn't be able to teach Mandarin. I teach Asian civilization. -Not a language class? -No, it's a class on the Asian business mentality for business leaders who want to set up in Asia. I must've misunderstood. I remember now. Sorry. -What? -You're the girl who... You work at the restaurant next to the bookstore. Yes, Aurore. Nice memory! Even if it's not a language class, could I attend? I'm not sure it's very... -Sorry, I'm in a hurry. -No worries. I'm meeting someone, but he doesn't care. He'll get here. I hope so, or you'll see me on TV? See you soon. What do you mean? In the news, crime section. COUNCIL OF STATE Damien Hauer. I have an appointment with the president. All these elements show that Mr. Désiré Békaté, 16 years old, is indeed the son of Mrs. Clarisse Békaté, naturalized French, and that the refusal of a visa infringes his right to respect for his private and family life. By these means, we conclude that the refusal to grant the visa should be annulled. -How are you? -Good. Unfortunately, I only have ten minutes to give you. -Didn't we say lunch? -Yes, but my meeting was delayed and the next one is earlier than expected. -The servitude of the State. -Oh, no... I shouldn't have told you, I'm sorry. -Are you in trouble, money problems? -No, when can we meet? -What about the 15th? -The 15th? My schedule is full. What else can I do? -Come have dinner at home. -Not this week. We have two evenings. Next week won't work either. We need to find the time. What is it about? It's the... The fiancée of Iva's brother, Vera, has a friend named Zorica. We'll never be done with the Balkans. At least Chinese civilization works. -Is she working on something? -You know she is. -Yes, sorry, The Cherry Orchard. -The Black monk. -Is it theater? -It's a short story she adapted. Funny idea. How did Noé do in school? Still an ace in math? No, in French. Math's not his thing, it's never been. He's doing fine in science, but needs to work harder in ELS. -What's ELS? -Dad! -We really need to... -Mr. President, the reporter and the assessor are in your office. I'm sorry. I'll call you. Bye. DAD PLEASE, IT'S IMPORTANT. I CAN WHENEVER... EXCEPT THURSDAY I TEACH UNTIL 2 P.M. Mom? Yes. Will he like it? Maybe. I don't know, clothes are getting harder. -But it's nice. -I thought so too. -You didn't have to. -I wanted to. When will you see your father again? As soon as possible. Try to convince him to go see an ENT. Dad hears perfectly well. -He hears what he wants. -He should do psychotherapy then. Why are you still together? It's a mystery. I should've left 30 years ago. Now it doesn't make sense anymore. And how could I have left him? I was crazy about him. In love like a snake. Not just me. All the girls were. -Can I take your newspaper? -Go ahead. Alright... Come over for dinner, OK? -Dad doesn't really want me to. -What a terrible man! -Don't exaggerate. -I'm not, I live with him. You don't know how tolerant I was. Did he have that many mistresses? I have to go. -Mickey, what's with the long face? -My name's not Mickey. I have something for you. It's gross, I'll never wear it. I'd rather die. Why are you home so late? -What happened? -We're here! Vera, what a nice surprise! Iva told us, we wanted to thank you. What you did is really great. -What did I do? -Come. -Thank you, but you shouldn't have... -It's from Zorica. I wanted to bring champagne, but it's superstition. Marco said to wait. We know your father's not God, even if he's not far from it. Zorica is like a sister to me, it kept me up at night. -Thank you. -Yes. -Thank you. -Hold on. You're right, my father's not... I know, I'll keep my fingers crossed too, but you did it, and that's great. Bring him to the salon, I'll cut his hair for free. What will he eat? Is he coming with us? -Did you...? -Do you have something planned? Do you have work to do? Are we interrupting? Not really. Excuse me. Stop acting up. I had nothing to do with this. I didn't invite them. You can't just kick people out. They shouldn't have invited themselves over. What do you want for dinner? Tuna, rice, cucumber? I'll bring it to your room. Cheese, yogurt? When's Mom coming home? I never see her anymore. Soon. Do your homework. I did it two hours ago. You didn't even ask. You suck. And if you take me to them to get a haircut, I'll kill you. Sorry. No worries Should I call him to thank him? My father? Absolutely not. He hates gifts, thanks, scenes... Which scene? It's normal to give thanks. -Hello. -Hi, Iva. How are you? Oysters? Zorica couldn't come? No, work. She was sorry. I promised I'd call her. No, no, listen... OK. THURSDAY AT 1:30 P.M. -She wants to talk to you. -No, sorry. -Just to... -Sorry, I have to answer. -ONLY DAY I CAN'T. -ONLY DAY I CAN. No, no! -What do you want? -Did you hurt yourself? I'm fine. Did you eat? -Mom's home. -Yes, I saw her. She stinks of cigarettes. If she continues, she'll die. -Stop it. Did you brush your teeth? -No. -Do it. -Someone's in the bathroom. Who's in there? I don't know. There are at least ten of them. -Where are they? -In the bathroom. -Both of them? -Yes. The oysters are delicious. Top-shelf, try them. You must be relieved. Was it difficult with your father? -Did you pay for the restaurant? -He didn't want to. You should've insisted. Was it a French restaurant? Indonesian. Indonesian? That neighborhood is mostly Japanese, isn't it? On Sainte-Anne Street, it is, but there was an Indonesian. I don't know why I said Indonesian. It was Thai, actually. I had a ground beef with galangal, -spicy as hell. -Thai, are you sure? Yes, I'm sure, ground beef with galangal. It must be Thai. What's with the inquisition? I was just wondering. Sure, but when your brother and sister-in-law... Not sister-in-law yet. Keep it down. Your brother and his fiancée, sorry, show up without warning to fuck in the bathroom, you don't wonder? You think it's normal? I call that behaving like pigs. They came to thank you. They're in love, enthusiastic. -I didn't know you were so prude. -Is it prude to ask people for a minimum of restraint, of discretion? Vera had dust in her eye. But it's gone now. It's gone. -What's wrong with your hand? -Nothing, it's the sink. The sink? I'll go ask Noé to turn his light off. Sorry. -Hello. -Hello. -Sorry about yesterday, I was... -In a hurry. -Yes, and nervous and distracted. -It happens to you. -You've noticed? -It's OK. You weren't on the news, so... Sorry I said that. You must've thought I was... -Not at all. -I regret it. Regret what? -Nothing. -Lobatch wants his revenge. I'll go to him. -Bye. -Bye. -Hello, Aurore. -Hello. -What are you reading? -I don't know. Recommend something. A smoke. -You smoke too much. -Stop, you sound like my son. I can even light it up for you. Today was better. Goodnight. Sorry... -I didn't hear you. -Sorry, I'm home late. You take care of everything, the house, Noé, his homework. And you have work to do. Noé does most of the complaining. He'll get used to it. He thinks you smoke too much. -Everyone does. -Who else? What are you doing tomorrow? You know, I teach on Thursday. Let's grab lunch after your class. It ends at 2 p.m., it's not practical. The day after tomorrow? Look at me, you don't look at me. I find you very, very beautiful. -No, I'm not beautiful. -You are. Very. Even a little tragic. You're missing an earring. You're better without it anyway. You're better without anything. You think, of course, that notions of truth, of objective reality, which are the common background to all our discussions and measure good or bad faith here, including, for example, salary or other negotiations. You think that these notions have existed forever and everywhere? It's a mistake. In classical Chinese civilization, they simply do not exist. Instead, we have something which could be translated as "what is appropriate, "what's right" and which is designated by this character. I'll let you meditate on it and I'll expand on all of that next time. It's not time yet. Meditate on that too. Unbelievable! -Hello, sir. -To the Council of State. -Where is it? -Palais-Royal Square. I'm just starting. Do you have directions? Palais-Royal Square, even if you're just starting out, you know where that is, right? The Louvre, the center of Paris, does that ring a bell? Sir, I just started. -President Hauer. -He's out. Out? I had a very important appointment with him. It's extremely urgent. He knows that. He's waiting for you there. Thank you. I thought you wouldn't come. The meeting is at 2:30 p.m. I came as fast as I could. Catch your breath. -Here's the menu. -I'll have what you're having. The same. -So, what's the emergency? -So, her name is... Zorica Velickovic. Croatian Serb through her father and Slovenian... no, Montenegrin through her mother. So, as a result of... Anyway, a divorce, her residence permit wasn't renewed. And of course, she's now under a... What is it called again? -Satoshi. -No. Satoshi, is his meal coming? -An expulsion order. -I'm done. Do you still have that wonderful green tea ice cream? Our matcha green tea ice cream. -Of course, Mr. President. -Then I'll have this delicious matcha green tea ice cream as my dessert. Very well, Mr. President. What is this famous matcha green tea ice cream called again? Pale shadow on Mount Fuji. Well, I'll indulge in that pale shadow on Mount Fuji, but quickly, please. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Right away, Mr. President. Sorry, you were saying? -Dad. -Yes? You... Are you gay? -Excuse me? -Are you homosexual? Odd question. -No, I'm not homosexual. -Sorry. I'll put it another way. Have you ever... -Slept with men? -Yes. Does that make me a homosexual? Excuse me. -Are you feeling better? -Absolutely. So... I don't quite understand. You sleep... with men, but you're not homosexual. There's a part of the other sex in each of us. Only fools refuse to acknowledge it. -Maybe. Nevertheless... -I do not like these ridiculous identity boxes where everyone scrambles to enter, this repugnant communitarianism seeking to impose itself everywhere, creating hatred of all for all and will eventually destroy everything. I sleep with whomever I want. No one will put a label on me. Alright, very well. How is it going for you? -What? -Love. I feel like it's not great. Not as great as you, Dad. Does Mom know? -I mean before... -She did. Well, time is ticking. What a disaster! -Satoshi, honey, my coat. -Yes. Dad, I... -I beg you, one minute. -Yes, I don't have that minute. Put the meal on my tab. Good luck, buddy. -Hello. -You look preoccupied. Do I? My grandma used to say that, I like that word. Is she still around? Why? Do I look that old? She's not my biological grandmother, I was adopted. What's wrong? Nothing, it must be my usual look. Have you thought of me? -Of you? -For your class? No, sorry, but I'll ask around. -Thanks. -I promise I will. -You had three smiles. -Excuse me? A polite smile for someone you barely know. A dry smile: I owe you money, but I'm soulless. And one for remorse, the last one, the nicest. -You read my article? -Yes. Because if the eyes are fixed on the sky, the message is on the lips. Is that right? Yes. That's an old article. Tell me what bothers you. Grandma says I always have a solution. It's simple, someone may be in trouble because I didn't talk to someone I should've talked to. Now I have to tell her, but I don't know how. And I have to tell her. Who? I don't get it. I'll let you know about the class. What's your number? It's 06 88 28 83 20. A lot of eights, which is a lucky number for the Chinese. For the Chinese, maybe. I saw you the day before yesterday. -Yes, me too. -I mean after. I didn't do it on purpose. I don't know how I do it. I always find... Something is wrong with me. I have to stop. To begin with, you shouldn't meet them at the Palais-Royal. True, I hate that area. Yes, it has a terrible subway station and Japanese restaurants. -Raw fish isn't my thing. -What is your thing? Snails, frog legs, veal head with gribiche sauce. Veal head is my grandmother's specialty. It's so good. Aurore. Come on. Alright. I really like Belgrade. I lived there for five years. Marek, tables 11 and 14 need to be cleaned up. I'll be right there. Do you really like the old men next door? You couldn't find better? They're broke. You really have a very nice smile when you get angry. Yes, I call it "I'm not fooled by this low flattery." The sudden idea. That's what I want, suddenness. Kiss her as if you were going to tear her mouth out. I don't want a shitty lovers' kiss. Laetitia, you can't react like that. Like what? You've never been kissed in your life. Now that you are, you're terrified. -Terror, that's it. -OK. OK. Start at "when you used to." When you came for the holidays, the house suddenly became more cheerful, fresher, as if we had rid the furniture and chandeliers of their covers. That's enough. -Too soon? -No, it's something else. Throw yourself at her feet. -I don't know, kiss her feet. -No, I couldn't. What's wrong with my feet? Do they disgust you? No, but it's going to be grotesque. You might as well go all-in then. You're Russians. No half-measures. Come on, I want to see that. When you came for the holidays... Hey! It should be easy. First person, plural. Good, perfect. Will you shower now or tomorrow morning? Tomorrow. When's Mom coming home? Whenever she wants. -Can you call her? -Her cell phone is off. You could try again. Go brush your teeth, it's bedtime. -Yes. -I'll come tuck you in. Yes. What's wrong? I can't leave. My son is in bed. My wife's not home yet. What's going on? Can't you go? There's nothing I can do. Come on, open the door. Come in. Tell me about your problem. Aren't you surprised to see me? I've been doing yoga for years, can you tell? No, you can't. Do I even feel it? I don't. I can't do it. -I can't do it anymore. -Do what? I can't meditate anymore. Meditating is the opposite of dreaming, you know. -I dream. -About what? Being happy. I shouldn't, I know where it leads. -It leads to this. -Where did you get that? What's the meaning of this? Too many questions at once. It's simple, it's mathematical. I can't live without her. She doesn't even know who I am. You may think it's happened to me dozens of times, but it hasn't. It's the first time since Rose's death. I've only had one woman in my life. She died ten years ago and now I'm old, at the end of my rope, madly in love. I'm depressed. -Have you been drinking? -No. -I smoked a little. Do you want some? -No. -What can I do? -Nothing. -Campuche told me... -Campuche has never loved anyone or anything. He wouldn't understand. I have to go to the bathroom. Tea? No, I don't want anything. "I'm not handsome, I'm not interesting, I'm not talented. "I'm not rich. "But Lise, I offer you everything I have "to the last blood cell of my blood, to the last cry." -Nosy! -Sorry. Who's Lise? It's no one. Listen, I didn't tell you anything. You didn't see me. -Come on. -Want to play a game? I don't feel like it. -What about talking? -I went through two therapies, one with short sessions, one with long sessions. Talking can no longer do anything for me. Good night. -Damien. -Yes. There's no Lise, no letter. I got it in a book, a novel by Nabokov, Nine, to be precise, you can check. Don't tell just anything to just anyone. It wasn't my intention. And to give me back what you took from me, is that your intention? Not tonight. -Give it to me. -No, Lobatch. -Give it to me. -Come on, stop it. Stop this, damn it! -There you are. -I left my smokes in the hall. They're gone. What did you do with them? Nothing, I didn't know they were there. I went to bed late, but you hadn't come home yet. Noé, did you hide my cigarettes? Don't talk to me about your cigarettes. That's not an answer. You hid them, give them back. I didn't hide them. -Don't lie to me. -I'm not, damn it. No! Don't talk like that. She said I was a liar, as if I gave a shit. If the bitch wants to die, I don't know where the fuck they are. -Stop that! -Don't tell me what I should and shouldn't do! -Explain yourself. -Where did he put them? -I'm not an idiot. -What are you talking about? Who were you with last night? What did you do? I'm waiting. Nothing. We went out for drinks after the rehearsal, at Alfred's, the fat guy who plays Tania's dad. We talked about the play. I drank too much, fell asleep and woke up late. I cycled home because I couldn't find a cab. -You want me to believe that? -Look, give him a call. -Fine. What about me? -What about you? Won't you ask what I did last night? Why was I up at 4 a.m.? What did you do? I narrowly prevented a suicide, or a murder. That's nice. You couldn't care less. Sorry, I'm tired. -I can't find my smokes. -You don't think I'm tired? And I have to teach too! Can we have lunch afterwards? I want to talk. -About what? -About us, everything. I have to tell you something, something important. -Tell me now, -No, it's complicated. You're complicated. I'll pick you up at the theater... No way, you know I hate that. That's my own space. Meet me at the Wepler at 1 p.m. I'm sure he stole them. -Did you hear me? -Yes. At the Wepler at 1. I heard. CAN'T. HAIR APPOINTMENT WITH ROSE. I FORGOT, SORRY. KISSES. You've reached Iva, please leave a message. Ladies and gentlemen, please turn your cell phones off. Thank you. I'm going to talk to you about the sky. Yes, the sky. For Asians, the sky is something different from what it is for us. What time is her appointment? I mean... She doesn't have an appointment today? OK. Thank you. Bye. Noé. Noé. What's this? -What? -Answer me. -A pack of smokes. -Why was it in the laundry basket? -I don't know. -Stop it, Noé. I can't stand lies. I didn't put it there, neither did Mom. Who did then? -I did. -That's better. Stop meddling in Iva's health. It's nice of you, but stop. -OK? -Yes. -You got something to say? -Yes. -What? -You promised to buy me a watch. -Yes, I know, I'll think about it. -I took Mom's. -Did you ask her? -No. She can do without, but you need to tell her. You'll tell her. -I can't. -Why not? I was racketeered. -When? Where? Today? -After school. And they took the watch? -Yes. -Fuck. -No way! -You won't tell her, right? I won't. -Promise? -I promise. -Which one? The red one? -Red with a red bracelet. -I'll try to... Go to bed. -Are you mad? -Not with you. Go to bed. -With whom? No one. Stop asking questions and stop messing around with watches, smokes and the rest. Give us a break. -Now go. -Good night. -Can you tuck me in? -Yes. Get out of here. -My masseuse? -Yes. If you have something to tell me, you can tell me. Since when? Two days. Who is it? Antoine. Antoine... But I love you. Do you love him? I don't know. A little. Maybe. But I love you too. "Too" doesn't work for me. What should I do? You're asking me? Go for it, see where it goes. -What does it mean? -Take your stuff and go to his house. -Now? -Right now, for three months. -I didn't mean... -I don't care. I'm going for a walk. Be gone when I get back. -What about Noé? -Noé is sleeping. He was alone for three hours yesterday, he'll be fine one hour. I'll make something up to tell him. -If that's what you want. -It's not! It's just the way it is. Hello, it's Damien Hauer. Hello. -Did you get a haircut? -I did. It's better, isn't it? It looks good on you. Thank you. You look even more upset than last time. I've been better. You're giving me the "I won't make a big deal" smile. That's right, I won't. How are you doing? Better. I wasn't doing well, but I'm picking myself up. My psychic predicted great changes. I dread change, but she said it'd be a lucky meeting. -Do you believe in these things? -Yes, the proof is that you're there. That's the smile: "don't take it literally, "your vanity might suffer." -You just made that one up. -It's not impossible. So what's happening to you? Something classic and banal. My wife's leaving me for someone else. It's sad, but it doesn't seem to affect you that much. It does, but it didn't surprise me. I've dropped a lot in her esteem, and also in mine lately. You're not the type to flog yourself for nothing? Not at all. I was left too, and I hate the one who left me. I think he's an idiot, because you don't leave a girl like me. I completely agree with that. The jerk took advantage of my problems, it's disgusting. -Your problems? -They're behind me now. You're lucky. I don't like to talk about it, but since they're behind me... In fact, I was under a deportation order after a divorce, because even if it doesn't show on my face, and you can hear it, I'm actually not French. -Not French? -That's why I work under the table. I always smell like fish. I'm Serbian. Croatian Serb through my father and Montenegrin through my mother, even though I spent a big chunk of my childhood here with this woman I call my grandmother. The one I can't help but talk about all the time because I love her. She saved my life, she loved me like no one. If I was forced to leave, she'd die, and so would I. It sounds dramatic, but I know it's true. But I'm very lucky. I have great friends, especially one who helped me because she knows people who know people. So now I won't be arrested, put in jail and deported. She's a hairdresser, she cut my hair. She's good, isn't she? Are you OK? What's your name? My name is Zorica. It's not Aurore? Zorica, means "aurore." With Zorica, people ask questions. With Aurore, they don't. Are you sure you're OK? No, I'm not. Did I bore you? I try not to talk too much, because I can't stop when I do. -Aurore, Zorica... -Aurore. Aurore, I'm the person who... Who what? Vera didn't tell you the name of the person who's helping? You know Vera? -You're the one... -I am, but... -It's extraordinary. -No, it's not extraordinary. Yes, it's amazing. You realize, you don't believe in the stars, -in clairvoyants... -Stop talking, damn it. Be quiet. Listen to me. I... I didn't do what Vera asked me to do. -You didn't? -I couldn't. I'm sorry. You were wrong... Actually, she was wrong to trust me. I'm not worthy of that trust. I was supposed to ask someone, in this case my father, to contact someone and I didn't do it. -But you told Vera... -Yes, because I was ashamed, but... I didn't do anything. It's very courageous of you to tell me face-to-face. I don't want to go to school. Stop it, Noé, you're not five anymore. -My stomach hurts. -Please stop. I'm tired. Where's Mom? She left early. She didn't sleep here, don't think I'm stupid. Are you going to get divorced? What's with these delusional ideas? Getting divorced, are you crazy? It's not delusional. All parents get divorced. I'm the only one of my buddies in school. First, to get divorced, you have to be married. And even if we were, we don't have to do like everyone else. You don't have to, but you're going to do it, it's obvious. -Just look at your face. -Enough is enough now. Did you shower? Did you see the time? Stop this and go shower. Do I have to? We have swimming lessons. -You have to sign my planner. -Go brush your teeth. By the way, don't forget the lid on the toothpaste anymore. -Got it? -I'll be late. Hello, Damien Hauer, to see the president. -Yes, but you need to... -I know, I don't have time. VISITOR ACCESS CONTROL Give me the minutes of Thursday's general assembly. Gentlemen. Please excuse me. Can you leave us? It's an emergency. Excuse me for a moment. What are you doing here? Why are you making a scene? You can't just walk in here and do as you please. Have you gone mad? Dad, you need to listen to me. You look terrible. Follow me. So? I'll give you ten minutes. It's very moving. You have to call him right away. -At any time... -This is theoretical? Theoretical? Not at all. -There's a real risk that... -The probability is low. The police could take a long time before looking into her. -I'm just asking you to call. -You care a lot about her. I gave my word I'd help her. You were wrong to give it without knowing my position. -But that's not the question. -What is it, then? There's nothing I can do. -You don't want to? -I cannot. You're asking me to call Henri, but he's been overstretched. He's now dismissing all such endeavors, including those of his closest friends, among which I have the honor to count myself. It can no longer, to use a famous and rather misquoted saying, take all the misery of the world upon himself. I'm very unhappy about it, but that's the way it is. Believe me. I've already been refused. And when he says no, it's without appeal. No, no! He might make an exception for you. -He has to! -You're not listening. I know the animal. He won't lift a finger. If I insist, I'll discredit myself in his eyes. I can't. It's a no. -Will you do nothing? -Because there's nothing to do. But... why didn't you tell me before? Isn't it the first time you've told me about it? How many? Do you have a reservation? No, it's not for lunch. I need to see one of your employees. She works in the kitchen, Miss Velickovic. -In the kitchen? -Yes, I'll just be a moment. -I'm sorry, that's not possible. -Why not? -You can't, it's the rules. -Is it for Aurore? -She didn't come in today. -Did she call? I have to talk to her. I have her number, but she's not answering. If she comes in, -can you tell her to call me? -Of course. Thanks. Where have you been? -Traumatized by your feat? -My feat? Lobatch. -Did Aurore come by? -Why would she? Bastard! I'm happy, dude. You know... I look at the sky, I breathe, I'm happy, I was -so dumb. To think... -How long has he been like this? -Lise... -Shut up. You two can sneer all you want. You would've let me die, but he... You know what you are? A great guy. No one tells you? I'm telling you: Damien, you're a great guy. You know what you are? You're a hero. They're 15 and 13, they're teenagers. Hello. -Stay outside. -I have to talk to... -Yes, I have something to say too. -What? I don't want to see your face again. Where were we? Mom? Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what time Dad is coming home tonight? Don't know where he is? No, it's nothing serious, but I'd like the private and professional number of Henri Hortense. Are you in his office? The red directory. Yes, thank you. Letter H. Hello, I'd like to talk to Henri, please, it's from Sébastien Hauer. Sébastien Hauer. Thank you. -Hello. -Hi, Seb, old hag. It's not Sébastien. Your secretary must've misunderstood. I'm his son, Damien. Well, hello. How's the old monkey? I'm talking about your father, don't take it the wrong way, it's very affectionate of me. He's doing well. I'd like to... Well, I guess you... you don't have time, I guess you're very busy, -I had a case I wanted to... -Your dad has a saying: the phrase "I don't have time," an infallible sign of absolute mediocrity. Does he? I always have time, especially for you. A specialist in the Asian world, right? Are you in a hurry? -Well... -Tomorrow 9 a.m., in my office? Damien. I'm always early, we have a coffee machine. -Thank you very much. -I look forward to meeting you, Damien. I'm picking up some things. Where's Noé? He's not home yet. Great, it's off to a good start. Iva? Where's my red watch? I can't find it, where is it? -It's Noé. -What about Noé? Nothing, I... What going on? Why did you do this to me? What did I do to you? That's just it! You've never done anything to me. In any case, nothing to keep me. Is that OK with you? -Say it. -What do you want, Iva? I don't know. I'm torn. And you're so calm, so cold. I'm talking to you. Stop pretending to flip through this thing that is no longer useful. How would you know? Marco told me about poor Zorica. What do you mean? We're looking for her everywhere, she went missing. It's your fault. -It'll get fixed. -Please, it's indecent. I made an appointment with the big man. It was with him I was talking when you arrived. I'll see him tomorrow. -You want me to believe that? -I don't care, Iva. Believe it or not... -Are you really? -At 9 a.m. at his office. 18, États-Unis Square, if you want to check... It's too late, anyway. Did you get what you wanted? Alright, I'm leaving. Don't forget that. Hi, what are you doing here? -Is that all you have to say? -I'm sleeping over at Black's. His mom's OK with it. We're going to watch House. -Just one episode. -Don't you have school? At 9:30 a.m. You have to take spare clothes, where are you going to put them? I'm not OK with this. It's not a problem, I have almost no homework, be nice. -What about your toothbrush? -It's not a problem. -Bye. -Bye. -She's tall. -Yeah. Farewell, sweetheart. -Good evening. -Is it for dinner? Yes, but I didn't make a reservation. Please follow me, sir. Thank you. Good evening. Excuse me, do you know if Mr. Hauer, President Hauer is coming tonight? I don't know. No, I know what I want. Tuna sashimi and sake, cold. What's your name again? Sorry... -Tayotoshi, Tatoshi. -Satoshi, sir. Would you like anything else, sir? One last sake for the road. Then... -Are you hurt? -No. Taxi, taxi, taxi. Iva? -Tea or coffee? -Coffee. -Satoshi. -Yes? -What happened last night? -You don't remember? I remember nothing, nothing at all, all black. -You were not well. -I'm still not well. -Do you want a pick-me-up? -A what? No, no. Just tell me what happened. You couldn't stand straight, I helped you get up to your house. -Then? -Then you got sick. So I put you in bed. But you could've left once I was in bed. From a practical point of view. Do you live far away? You invited me. I invited you? Invited to what? You wanted to, then you didn't want to. You said nice things, then mean things. You were agitated. -I calmed you down. -Satoshi, stop talking in dribs and drabs, it's torture. What does that mean, I wanted to, I didn't want to? Just tell me what you did to calm me down and how I calmed down. You didn't... abuse the situation? I never abuse any situation, sir. Alright, so much the better. Phew! -So? -So... I sucked your toes and you slept right away. Have some fruit juice. It's good for you. Mr. Hauer. -Hello. -Hello. -Please follow me. -Yes. -Coffee, Mr. Hauer? -Gladly, thank you. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -Sébastien only talks about you. -It's a surprise to me. He's very proud of you, of your specialty. I'm going to China next month. This is where the level of global growth is decided, -for what's left of it. -Certainly. Actually, the case I wanted to talk to you about... It's the only hyperpower today. The West is over, that's the way it is. But every colossus has feet of clay. It's a country with weaknesses, isn't it? Huge ones: the environment, public health, disasters, corruption, the energy equation is hugely deficient. I'm expecting a study on the huge debts of local financing platforms. They say it's beyond imagination. Indeed, it's considerable. -One more? -No, thank you. I'd be happy to give you detailed information on the matter whenever you want. But now, if you could look into someone's fate who finds herself in a situation that is both tragic and unjust. -I have her file here. -Let me see. Zorica Velickovic. We'll never be done with the Balkans. I'm begging you to take her case into consideration. It's a question of simple humanity. -Given your proximity to... -Excuse me. Roxane, when does it start? They're here? I'm on my way. I'll see what I can do. Sorry, I have to go to a meeting. Orielle will walk you back. -You're not keeping the file? -I remember the name. I have an exceptional memory. Thank you for coming. -Say hi to your father. -Of course. Bye. -Hello. -Hello. It didn't work? How do you know? No need for a psychic, it's written on your face. Iva told you? We talked last night. I wanted to see you anyway. I heard about what Marco did to you. I think it's a stupid way to react. Where were you? I looked for you? I left a for a bit to take stock. After what you told me, I was... -Can we walk? -Yes. -Are you not mad at me anymore? -You tried after all. I failed miserably. It doesn't matter anymore. You did me a favor. I had a decision to make and you helped make it. -There are a lot of cops here. -I think there's a... -I don't like it. -Don't worry. What was your decision? How did I help you? I'm done with odd jobs, this shitty life. I'm leaving France. I'm going to India and I'm going to have a child. Ah! Really? To India? -Does it look rushed? -Did I push you to do this? There's someone. I was tired of relationships, but he's a good guy, I know that. And it's the right time to have a child. But why India? He wants us to get married in Bengal. He wants to know Bengal. Then we'll move to the United States, on the East Coast. There are opportunities there. I will find work. The only thing that makes me... That would hold me back, that hurts me a little... -You know. -I don't. My grandmother. Yes, always her. I may not see her for a long time. My subway is this way. You... -No, I prefer to walk. -Here's your file, you never know. OK. Thank you. Aurore, you know, that child, I would've like to have it with you. Well, goodbye, Aurore, and... -Have a nice trip. -Bye. Stop! That's mine. That's mine. Your ID, please. -No, no. -Excuse me? I don't see why I'd give it to you. I did nothing wrong. This isn't in a dictatorship. -I refuse to, I don't even... -It's the law, sir. Fuck the law, fuck you. Do you want to be in custody for contempt? Your name, your ID and fast. Do you think orders are an excuse? You can't tell your superiors to go fuck themselves with their dumb orders, so you want revenge on ordinary citizens? That's lame. -You cops are buffoons. -That's enough. Cuff him. Yeah, cuff him. Want to search me? Go ahead. Go ahead! Ouch! -You're hurting me. -I need a unit. I was a little worried and I wanted to thank you. Are you in trouble, did they arrest you? No, the local commissioner was super nice, understanding and sympathetic. -You were lucky. -Do you want to come in? I'm cold. -No, I don't have much time. -One minute. He actually wanted some advice about Lanzhou. His wife is Filipino, he's thinking about learning Tagalog. I was beside myself. I wanted to be treated like everyone else, but in vain. He even walked me out. I think I'm getting sick. I have aches and pains, I feel weird. Take a warm bath. Thanks, I just did. -Well, I have to go. -Wait, I have a question. What interested you about Chinese culture? The Chinese say that we have too much goodwill and not enough patience. I'm hoping to learn patience. And maybe I want to be interested in you, too. -Well... -I mean your group. It's among you that... How did you get interested in China? It was a trip, a long time ago. I don't remember anything before it. It's as if... Maybe I didn't exist. It was a trip with friends after high school. It was still under Deng Xiaoping, a year before Tiananmen. It rained a lot that day, near the Yellow River, between Fengdu and Xuchang. There was mud everywhere and suddenly, the sky cleared. There was this old Chinese man, motionless, wearing all blue, looking. What was he looking at? What did he see that I didn't see? I never saw. Maybe one day I'll find him again, then I'll understand everything. -You have a fever. You're burning up. -You think I'm delusional, but... I mean, I'm telling you something I've never said to anyone before. Hold on. You said: "It's among us that..."? What did you want to say? It's with one of you that I'm leaving. He probably didn't tell you because he's too modest. Not Lobatch? No, don't do that. I beg you, Aurore. Don't do that. What if you're wrong? And you are, of course you are. You've always been wrong, always. You won't be able to come back. It's... I did get really sick. I missed La Générale Diva. The press was mixed. She was already on another project, left Antoine, and began an idyll with Jérôme, who adapted a Polish novel. Noé didn't want to see me anymore due to my betrayal about the watch. I never went to Casimir again, and I haven't heard from Campuche anymore, or from Lobatch or Aurore. -You look better. -Yes, physically. -Did you go back to teaching? -You look tired. The ghost of retirement. I never felt old, but your mother ended up winning. I'm wearing this horrible thing. And... And I just got dumped. -So you know how it feels. -It's not the first time. But I fear it's the last. What can I do for you? What do you want from me? I'm thinking of a drawing I saw, I think, or I dreamed it while I was sick. It's a crowded tram and whenever a passenger climbs in it from one side, another passenger is ejected on the other side. The tram is the world. And these two passengers are you and I. I don't get it. You're asking me what you can do for me. My answer is: disappear. -They let you in with that? -I don't go through the gate anymore. Damien, if I've hurt you in any way, if I've given you the impression of neglecting you, or even of despising you, forgive me. I recognize that I'm a fairly self-centered person. So, despite your retirement, your loneliness, your inevitable decay of the faculties of your body, you want to keep living? That's my business. And if I wanted to end things, the way I would do it is my business as well. Take it back. For weeks now, I've been opening the drawer where I keep it every day thinking that my life is over. Stop it, this is nonsense. That's what I thought. You're not afraid for me. You don't care about would could happen to me. Lobatch! Lobatch! -Aurore? -Yes. It's Damien, where are you? In Paris, but I'm about to leave. For India or the United States? Saint-Pol-Sur-Ternoise, to see my grandmother. Why? Could you not leave? I have things to tell you, it's... It's very important. Can you tell me when I return? I bought my ticket. Who cares about your ticket? I... I call you. Bye, Damien. Hello? Hello. Your ticket, please. Thank you. Hello. Aurore. -What are you doing here? -I'll ask the questions. What about your trip to Bengal? -As you can see, I didn't go. -Why not? Because of... Because of what you told me. Still single? Without children, without papers? -It's my destiny. -I'm not sure about that. -You think so? -I think we can work it out. Do you like veal head? I don't mind it. Did I tell you about my grandmother's recipe? Yes, I have a vague memory of that. You told me about it. Subtitling: Hiventy
