NETFLIX PRESENTS [melancholy piano music plays] INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS [music continues] [music fades] [man] Lophiiformes. Anglerfish. Bluntnose sixgill sharks. Macropinna microstoma. Barreleyes. The giant squid, Architeuthis dux. All these creatures are capable of surviving in depths extending far beyond the epipelagic zone and any sunlight. So how can these creatures adapt to such depths? They are survivors of the sea. There is a microlayer on the surface of the ocean that moves between sea and sky. DIVISIONS OF OCEANIC ENVIRONMENT It is simultaneously both and neither. Every known life form exists in relation to this microlayer. Above it, the world of land, air, sunlight. Below it, the world of water, the world of depth, and pressure. The deeper that you go, the darker it gets, the more hostile. At around 30 meters, the alveoli in your lungs start to contract, leaving you with only a portion of the air you inhaled at the surface. The massive amount of water pressure bearing down on you would be excruciating. And should you go deeper, your lungs would cease to function, killing you on the spot. - [bell rings] - Have a good week, everyone. [wistful music plays] CONFERENCE FREEDIVING CLASS BY THE 2015 WORLD CHAMPION PASCAL GAUTIER [music fades] [woman] Is that you, sweetie? Yeah. - [dog barking] - You know, you could sit while you eat. [sighs] You stopped going. - You're not going anymore? - Well, I don't need her. According to who? According to you or her? Mom, don't. I don't wanna talk about it. You never want to. - We need to discuss it. It's important. - Well, later. I have schoolwork. - Maybe later. - Later, it's always later! Tell me when! Seriously. [sighs] [wistful music plays] MOM I WON'T BE THERE THIS WEEKEND I'M STAYING WITH A FRIEND LOVE YOU [insects chirping] [music fades] Excuse me! Wake up. [chain rattles] Come on, get up. Let's go! You can't sleep on the beach. This isn't some hotel. There's a youth hostel nearby. This isn't actually a bed. [chuckles softly] - You speak English? - Uh, yes. I'm here for the diving class with Pascal. We get a bunch of kids sleeping on the beach, so I thought that... Was the youth hostel full, then? I'm not sure. I spent all my money on the course. I'm glad. - [chuckles] - Sorry, I'm Tom, one of the instructors. You want a coffee? Yeah, okay. PORQUEROLLES, MAY 2016 [Tom] Freediving isn't about how long you can stay underwater without breathing or how deep you can go while holding your breath. It's about the experience down there. The peace. The tranquility. In fact, most of my course is focused on how to be in the best state of mind before you dive. You need to be at peace in order to know the limits of your body. There are three golden rules. Number one... Anybody? Never dive by yourself, okay? You always gotta freedive with a partner, with another safety diver. Yeah? Two. Don't try to dive down as deep as possible because it's dangerous. And pointless. Okay? And the third one? Just stay calm, relaxed, zen. - All right. - Well. Everyone take a deep breath with me. [inhales] And let the breath go. [exhales] And get rid of all of your frustrations, all your anger. - All your fears. - [exhales] [engine whining] [chuckles] Here he is, the maestro himself! World champion, world record holder, although he's not quite as good-looking as I am. I give you Pascal Gautier! [Pascal] Hi, everyone. I'm glad you're here. A big part of what stands between you and success is your fear. So you'll need to learn how to handle this fear. To control it. This is what will enable you to go beyond your limits. And I promise you that after today, you're going to have a different feeling. A new connection with the ocean. A new strength and a new sensation, a new power. And then, you'll wanna sign up for the next level. I promise. [applause] [Tom] All right, here we go, everyone in the water. [wondrous music plays] [music fades] Nice work. You're doing well. You need to block your air around your glottis and throat, not your lips, okay? Don't release any air. Not even a bit. Not until you're sure you're actually going to breathe again. Each movement is a waste of energy. So don't waste it. Stay calm. Trust your teachers. Trust your instincts. Everyone, listen up! Take a look at how he's moving to go lower. Watch what he does! [tense music plays] [music fades] How far can he go? Pascal is special. He can do 80, 100 meters, no problem. What makes him so special? It's mainly his ability to stay calm. It's what I said earlier. He's focused. You need to stay calm down there. He's also developed an extraordinary threshold for pain. The difference between great divers and the rest is the ability to endure that pain. How long has he been down there for? Around two minutes. [tense music plays] [music fades] Thanks again. [Tom] Keep it up, be ready for a challenge, okay? - Did you have a good time? - [man] Yeah. - [Tom] See you all tomorrow. - Okay, see you tomorrow. - Hey, thanks. - Hey. - See you. - Thank you. - Do you know where you're staying? - Uh, no, not yet. Not on a beach chair, I hope. Why not? It's nice sleeping under the stars. Thank you for today. I learned a lot. - You had me fooled. - With what? - You've dived before. - Not really. I went spear fishing with my grandpa, but that's different. Not really. It all started with that. You should stick with it. You're good. I'd like to. But it's not really in my budget. [man] Hey, Tom, where are you going? - I'm here! - Well, come help us. All right. Come meet me and the team tonight. I'll help you find a place to sleep. I'm friends with the guy at the youth hostel. - Okay. - Okay? I'll shoot you a message. Coming. - Seriously, we need your help. - Okay, okay! - Hey! - Come on! These guys get there with six bottles of vodka. They were huge, big Russian guys, like a Bolshevik reunion or something. - This little French guy with them. - No way! He looked like Asterix, with this creepy mustache, yeah? But yeah, anyway, they show up with this Russian girl, and oh, man. Look, you girls are Champions League, but, uh... she was World Cup, so... I love you guys. So, we get the party started. Nothin' but shots, shots, shots. I down one, two, three. This guy was holdin' his own, man. Holdin' up the table, the bar, the walls. He was a beast! I knew we were done. But shit, we drank so much. Bretons, Normans, whatever, not one of them could keep up. But now... [man 1] Well, now you gotta tell us how it ends. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, Roxana, everybody. - Everybody, Roxana. - Hey. - Hi, everyone. - Welcome. - [man 2] Hi. - [man 3] How's it going? - Roxana, from class today. - [Pascal] What? I know. [laughs] He's lying, he doesn't know. Don't wink at me, all right? I do remember. - [laughter] - [man 4] You've got a nerve, you bastard. Uh... Right, Well, then, anyway. So the guy shows up with this Russian girl, and she's been looking at me from the start. This one guy's watching me. We're losing, but I am focused on the Russian girl. So did you beat them? These dudes started drinking vodka when they were children. - What are you gonna do? I mean, no. - You can't outdrink Russians. We all ended up in jail in Athens. It was a bit of Prison Greek! - Oh! Prison! Prison Greek, okay! - [Pascal] Guys, guys, guys. This is the time for bad jokes, guys. This is it. I love it when you're like this. Na zdarovie to all the Russians! - And Greeks! All right! - [Tom] Na zdarovie to the Greeks! - [Pascal] Na zdarovie to the Greeks! - [man 4] But it's true. It was insane! - [laughter] - [Tom] I bet. [water running] [door opens] [giggles] [both gasping] [man 1] Of course that whore put a curse on me! I told you she was meeting with shamans! - She cursed me in Russian! - [laughter] Oh, man. I got the moves. My skin is tingling. I just wanna go dance. Everything okay here? [sighs] - You start the party already? - Wanna join? [woman] Asshole! - What a fucking asshole. Unbelievable. - [Pascal] But... Anna! - [clears throat] - [Pascal] Come back! [chuckles] [man 4 laughs] Just can't help yourself. You were saying? Well, uh... Here's to love. And to sex. - [Pascal] Kevin, know Russia? - [woman] Cheers. - [Kevin] Military secret. - [man 5] Military secret? Seriously! - [Kevin] Yeah! - [man 5] He won't talk about it! [jaunty music plays] [Pascal sighs] [music fades] "From birth, man bears the weight of gravity on his shoulders." "He is bolted to the Earth." "But man only has to sink below the surface..." [both] "And he is free." [chuckles] You like Cousteau? A lot. He's one of my mentors. Come on. Now show me what you've learned. [wondrous music plays] - You're not bad. - [laughs] What? For a girl? For a Parisian. [music fades] [gulls calling] [air hissing] Stéphane. Can you look after Roxy? Show her a few things? [air hisses] Shit. - Don't let me get in your way. - [Stéphane] You're already here. If it were up to me, I'd never let a rookie join us. But it's not my decision. Besides, it's always the same with him. Just watch and learn. [chuckles] - Did he tell you what he's doing today? - Yeah. A practice dive, right? [scoffs] That asshole. Yeah, just practice. He's doing 172 meters. That's two meters deeper than the current world record for no limit. Oh shit. No one's gone that deep before. Except in a submarine. Is it dangerous? [scoffs] All no limit dives are dangerous. Especially for a new world record. - You know what no limit is? - No. You're hooked to a sled that takes you into the depths. To get back up, you inflate a lift bag, it fills with air, and pshht. You come back to the surface. There are many other categories. CNF, CWF, static. Uh, CN what? CNF. Constant Weight No Fins. WF, With Fins. So it's with or without fins. - And he's using this? - This is the sled. This thing takes him down. And this brings him back up. We'll check everything before he dives. The diving tank. The pony tank. The release. The lift bag. The lift cord and the pressure valve. We check everything multiple times before a dive. And that... that guarantees he gets back to the surface. There's no room for error. Unless he pisses us off, then... No, I'm kidding. - [air hisses] - Uh. The connection's fine. Everything's good. Perfect. Okay, so, uh... This takes the diver down, and then you wait for him down there in case something happens? Yeah, more or less. There are divers every 40 meters. That makes eight of us. And a medic. I'm at the bottom, and after he comes back up, I wait. I have to decompress in stages for three hours before I get back to the surface. All right. All right, 30 minutes for the dive team. Thirty minutes! - [man 1] Okay! - [man 2] Thirty minutes! And what if he passes out down there? All blackouts happen 20 meters before the surface. He might get nitrogen narcosis. It's like being drunk underwater. Some divers lose function when they reach the bottom. So Pascal needs to do four things. Number one, he gives us an okay. Two, he grabs the lift bag. Three, he twists the valve, releases the pin, and goes up. He's going through 18 pressure atmospheres. That's big. His lungs are the size of an orange down there. And if there's a problem, I can't give him any air. His lungs would explode. Safety meeting! Everyone, let's go! All divers, state your name and depth position. Jacques, surface safety. Mathieu, deep safety diver, at 40 meters. Alain Calmette, emergency rescue. Surface team. Loïc, safety Trimix diver, 172 meters. Thierry, deep diver, 40 meters. [Tom] 9:42! Tom, safety Trimix diver. 172 meters. - Three minutes to immersion. - Three minutes! [air hissing] [tense music plays] [man on deck] Okay! Thirty seconds to dive. [exhaling] [inhaling] Five, four, three, two, one, go! 110 meters. 140 meters. 172 meters. [rattling and creaking] Here he comes! 110 meters! 100 meters! Here he is! [Pascal inhaling deeply] [music fades] - [Pascal] I'm okay. - Yeah! - Whoo! - Yeah! All right! - Yeah! - [cheering and laughter] - All right! - Yeah! - Yes! - Whoo! - Yeah! - Yeah! - All right! Let's go! - Whoo! [laughter] Mathieu? Shit, Mathieu? Mathieu! - Where's Mathieu? - Hey! - Go! - [Stéphane] Go! Go! Go! Where is he? We have to go! [dramatic music plays] I'm calling for help. - [bleep] - Mayday, mayday! This is the Ketos. We need emergency medical assistance. A diver hasn't come up. Our location is 40° 00' 02" North, 6° 13' 38" East. - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Watch his head. - Bring him up. - Hold his head up. Mathieu! - Here we go. - Careful. Help me lift him. - Let's get him up. - Hold his head. Okay. - Squeeze my hand. Can you hear me? - [man] Harbor master, Ketos. We have an unconscious diver on board, he's completely unresponsive. - We need emergency help! - [woman] Roger that, Ketos. - Aren't you a first responder? - Sending help. What happened? - Shit! He's in cardiogenic shock! - I need to do something! - He's not breathing. There's no pulse. - Damn it. [gasping] Get him to a hospital! - Sacha! First aid, damn it! - [Alain] Okay, keep going. - [Sacha] Where is the harbor master? - [Roxana gasping] - Thierry, did you see what happened? - [Alain] We gotta get him to shore. [Sacha] Here, toss me that, will you? [Pascal] Excuse me. [officer] Now, you were on the boat, correct? [Alain] Yes, I was. [music fades] [Pascal] Okay, guys. Let's unload, and then we have to make a statement at the police station. Yeah? And tell them what? That he shouldn't have been at 40 meters because he was a rookie? Then why'd you say it was fine? So did you. - It was an accident. - Exactly, it was an accident. - [clanging] - A horrible accident. That we should have prevented. Everyone here knows the risks, okay? And he wasn't just your friend. Stéph! I'm sorry, okay? It's the stress. And I'm angry too. He was my friend. And a good diver. You hear me? - A good diver. - [scoffs] Don't worry, I'll say whatever you say. [melancholy music plays] [crickets chirping] [music fades] [Pascal sighs] I'd like us to take a moment. We lost a friend yesterday. A member of our family. Mathieu loved this work. He was conscientious. Applied himself. And he was passionate, just like all of us. Despite that, he knew the risks. He accepted them. I don't wanna speak for him. But he'd want us to continue. If you all agree, I think we should go for the record. And we'll do it for Mathieu. But we need another safety diver at 40 meters. Shit, okay. All right, I'll do it. [Pascal] Okay, great. Thanks, Jacques. [sighs] We need a surface diver. Okay. Um... [man shouts in distance] I can do it. [man shouts] Hey! Are you crazy? You did okay yesterday, but you don't become a safety diver in two days. This is bullshit. I think she's more than capable. She's talented. And has great instincts. Pascal. Hey. Let's ask the rest of the team what they think. Then we'll decide all together. Well, I also think she can do it. [Pascal] She's good. She's held longer than five minutes, no problem. She shouldn't be in the water, regardless! Tom! She has a gift, Stéphane. Tom. She knows first aid. And she won't be alone. [scoffs] No one else, huh? Go fuck yourselves, all of you. Stéphane's right. - This is too fast. - [Tom] We need someone, don't we? Do you think you could learn the procedure quickly? If you teach me, I can. I've been diving since I was little. I'm first aid certified. Okay. So, who's in favor? [Pascal] You should go back to school. To your life. No, I was serious. I want to be a part of the team. And be away from your family? And school? I've decided. You should go back to school. [scoffs] - [laughing] - I said no, all right? Okay. So you stay for this competition. Then what? Well, that's up to you. See. He's losing his air. That means he fainted. Blackout. Vice grip. Cradle the back of the neck. Protect the airways. All right? Remove his mask. Try to wake him up. Breathe, breathe, Pascal, breathe. He's not responding. Put your hand on his mouth. Mouth to nose. Blow hard. Remove your hand each time. All right? And if he doesn't come to, boat and oxygen. Vice grip, okay? Roxy! [blows] Pascal, breathe. Pascal, just breathe. [both chuckle] Freediving is serious. You know what I mean? That's why we implement all of the rescuers, the gestures, and all. You need to know everything, have everything under control, - You got that? - Okay, yeah. - If you're cold, signal this. - Mm. - If you're tired, signal "I'm done." - Like this, you mean? This means, "It's over, end of the event." AIDA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP PORQUEROLLES AUGUST 2016 [announcer] Pascal Gautier. No limit world record attempt, 172 meters. Two minutes to official top.

You need to understand. These blackouts aren't harmless. I'm asking you to stop. You're taking too many risks now. It is what it is. It's my life. Maybe you should see a different doctor. He's doing his job. It's always the same. I'll dive again when I feel like it. - But I thought of somethin' else. - What? Go on. [laughs] Come on, what? [laughs] Just tell me! FIRST PRACTICE PORQUEROLLES AUGUST 2016 [Pascal] Clear mind. Clear dive. You have the technique, the lungs. You know what to do. Things get complicated the day of the competition.

Indeed, who knows the depths better than Pascal Gautier? But you already know that. Mwah! - No, thank you, guys. - Thank you. - Are you proud? - Well, yeah, I am. - You deserve it. - That RMC journalist is a bit of a boor. - [Mom] Are you Pascal? - Well, no. - He was really weird. - I'm Roxana's mother. [Pascal] Nice to meet you. A pleasure. Did you have a nice trip down? - Mom? - Yes, I did. - What are you doing here? - Oh, well. I had no idea this event would be so... important. But why are you here? You don't like the beach. Uh... Or boats, or the ocean, I mean... Why are you so aggressive? What's the problem here? All this isn't good for her. It's harmful. - You don't even know my daughter. - Mom! Don't say that.

I told Grandpa about it. He couldn't believe it. He was overjoyed. How's he doing? Good. Of course, his heart is still weak. That's not going to change. But he's fine. He misses you.

Her last competition, she reached 130 meters. - Well... - You sure? - Suit yourself. - She wants to beat the record like that? - They'll never let her. - They will. She did it during training. They're watching the video now. She's gonna beat the men's record. - She'll do it. - [woman] Oh, you think I will, huh? - [Pascal] Hi... - And he won't pick up his fucking phone. Five. Four. Three.

Does he know about the record? - Set it to 180. - [Roxana] Why do you think we're here? He wants to reach 180 meters. [scoffs] He's crazy if he thinks we're gonna watch him self-destruct. - I'm gonna dive! - Please listen. It wasn't planned. - You know I have to beat it. I'm doing it. - [sighs] - [Tom] I don't wanna see this. - They'll never let him. Plus, no time. All right, let's go. - He's out of his mind. - [Sacha] Yeah. - I'm ready. I'll destroy her. And you too! - No. No! - Oh, okay... - You'll fucking regret this. Hey, whoa, calm down. Fuck you! I won't forget this. - Calm down, Pascal. - [Pascal] Let's go! Come on, let's go! You want me to drive, or what? Okay, thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a national record for a new French diver. And that's not necessarily a big deal, but the woman who made this record, this was her very first competitive dive. - And that's a big deal. - [whistling] [cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, a new record for France in the Constant Weight with Fins category... 56 meters.

That whole dive was bullshit! - [sighs] - Did you see the video? - No. - Well, she's an imposter. - And I'm winning my title back. - What are you even saying? I'm not gonna stop competing 'cause of a couple unlucky dives, okay? Just let your body rest! Listen to the doctors. You've gotta be kidding. I'm never going to! I'd rather anyone else hold this record. Even you. Because I saw you back there. I saw the way that you loved the spotlight. - That's really sad. - That's really sad? Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what's sad. My father left when I was five. He beat my mother every night. And we were relieved when he finally left us. And then my mother left. The poor woman couldn't take care of me. She drank so much. But now look at me today. I've set 25 world records. There are those who sit in the sun and those who touch the sun. I built this myself. I got my revenge on everything and everyone. Threw back every punch I got. And I'm not tired of fighting. I'm a champion. But I guess you think that's also sad, don't you? - I'm sorry, but that's not what I meant... - It's fine, forget it. [sobs] I need a little air. You go back to the hotel. [whimpers softly] [melancholy music plays] [ringing tone] [bleep] Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier. I'm unavailable at the moment. Leave a message after the beep. Thank you. [bleep] Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier. I'm unavailable at the moment. - Leave a message after the beep. - [bleep] [ringing tone] [music fades] Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier. I'm unavailable at the moment. [gulls calling] [Stéphane] Give me that. No, I'm good. - How you feelin'? - Tired. Have you seen Pascal? - He didn't mention it? - No. What do you mean? Wait. What's going on? He needed to be alone. He left for Kalamata. They wouldn't let him dive because he blacked out. I'm sorry. I thought he'd said something. No, he did. I just didn't know he'd be leaving so early. Hey, I know Léa was sad to say goodbye. How would you know that? - No. - [Roxana] Stéph? Are the blackouts really serious? Well, they're not good. It happens to some divers, with age. The problem is that once they start, they rarely stop. There you have it. You want me to call Pascal? No. If I needed to call him, then I'd call him myself. All right, let's go. See, for me, this is the real deal. No fins. No sled. No lift bag for resurfacing. Just you, your strength, and your know-how. You've got the technique. You've got the lungs. You're gifted. I'm not kidding. Some people immediately excel in sports. It's rare, especially in freediving, but still. You... You have a natural physiology for it. And that... That is a gift. But it's not enough. What matters most is your mind. Visualize the dive as if you were in a training session. Stay focused. Stay calm. There. Long breath in... [inhales] [exhales] What is it? - I'm not sure I'm ready. - Of course you're ready. I wouldn't let you dive if I didn't think you could do it. All right? It's not the same without him. Roxy. You don't need Pascal. You don't need anyone. You don't even need me, so... [exhales] Thanks. [exhales] HELLENIC FREEDIVING CUP KALAMATA, GREECE OCTOBER 2016 [dramatic music plays] [music fades] [murmur of conversation] [Roxana] And it's a... it's a beautiful kind of meditation - when you're that deep underwater. - [people chatting] [Roxana] But what really makes it unique is, uh... It's... it's the loneliest team sport. A lot of fans have recently commented on the fact that freediving as a sport is being taken over by gorgeous women. Which, for me, isn't necessarily a problem, but... I was wondering if you cared to comment on both your newfound role as a star athlete and, let's be honest... a sex symbol. - [laughter] - Whoa. [chuckles] Oh, I don't know, it's, uh... It's not very feminist, but thank you for saying that. Um... I'm not a star athlete yet. Uh... And I'm definitely not a sex symbol. [laughs] - Yes, you are! - [chuckles] Uh, no, no, but I think it's, um... It's a very interesting moment in this sport. One where the... the line is blurring between men and women, and it's just about who's the best. Or maybe that's naive. - Uh... - Not one bit. Congratulations again. - Ah, thank you. - [applause] I think what you're doing is so amazing, and... - Other than being a sex symbol, obviously. - [laughs] And now you're really killing it. I think we got what we wanted, yeah? - Everything's good. - No, uh... thank you. I really appreciate this. - It's my pleasure. - Yeah. [laughs] Thanks. I think we're all good. - Thanks. - That's all right. You came. [Pascal] And at just the right time, apparently. What do you mean? Where were you? You disappeared and the team had to tell me you left? I said I needed some space. You said that you needed to take a walk. What was that, huh? What was what? It doesn't matter whether I'm here holding your hand or not. You're a professional athlete now. You're my partner, and you're part of my team. - Yeah, and? - Then start acting like it! Blushing like a schoolgirl when a guy looks at you. Don't forget how we got here. [tense music plays] [Roxana] Pascal! [crackling] Pascal! They're all waiting for you. [gulls calling] [music fades] I've been thinking. And I think it's time now. To go for the record. We can't leave things how they are. - Ugh. Come on. - Wait. I know what you're about to say. That I'm not ready. That I need more training. I'm not in good enough shape. I get that. And it's true. You're right. I wouldn't be. But Roxana is. - What's that? - You know she's more than capable. CWF is a lot more complicated than no limit. - Oh, really? - That right? You really think she's ready for no limit? [Tom] Okay. Forget about it. I quit. I quit. We've done some crazy stuff together, Pascal, but this is too far. This isn't the time to fucking give up. No. You can risk your own life doing this, but you can't do it with others. Stéph. - I agree. - [Pascal] You're kidding. This time, I won't do it. You think I'd put the love of my life in danger like that? Just because? You actually think that. - [sighs] - [Pascal] Go ahead. Mr. Tom and Mr. Stéphane are out. You want out? Do you wanna quit? Seriously, you're leaving? So after everything we've been through together, you're bailing. You want to go home? Then beat it, get lost! If you don't like it, then you can just go! All of you, go! I don't need anyone here. You got that? You're not leaving, I'm firing all of you! - Get out! All of you! - Stop it! [sobs] All of you, sit down! I am tired of everyone else making my decisions and speaking for me. Pascal wouldn't put me in danger. And just stop talking about me like I'm not even fucking here! I'm right here! Doing this dive is my choice. I'm not doing this for Pascal. I'm doing this for me. Is this your father? No. [sighs] That's my uncle. The one who raised me. [sighs] [dog barking in distance] He's the one who taught me how to dive. [chuckles] Back then, I could barely hold the spear gun. You'll have your comeback. You don't know. Maybe you're right, but... I know what it's like to... feel like it's over. I was an awkward kid. I had braces. I was skinny. [laughs] I told you that. But... I felt alone. My dad killed himself when I was 12. Depression. He refused to get help. He was so young. My mother was a wreck. I was... I don't know. [sighs] I just had questions. Why did he want to do it? Why did he want to leave us? Could I... could I have stopped him? Or did I do something? I kind of got obsessed with the idea of death. What would it feel like? Uh... And at some point, it was all too much. And one day, I just decided. That was the day. That was it, I would join him. I filled up the tub with water and cut open my wrists. My grandfather found me in there. And he saved my life. [chuckles softly] That's not who you are now. You mean more to me than... than any trophy or any record. It's the truth. I would throw it all away. I don't know, give it up, go to a deserted island with you, and have children. [laughs] [gasping] [gasps] - [Roxana coughs] - [Pascal groans] [choking] [Pascal gasps] - [whimpers] - [Pascal] Oh! - [coughing] - [Pascal gasping] [whimpers] [cries out] [groans] [gasping] [whimpers] [whimpers] [both sighing] Why don't we put everything else aside? I just want to do what's best for us. [Pascal sighs] You already wanna give up? We don't give up. [sighs] You're a champion now. Thanks to me. You wanna be insignificant again? Live life in the shadows? You're just afraid. Right? When you're the best, you don't quit. I'm going for a walk. ["Sonho de Maria" by Marcos Valle playing] Okay, okay. - How are you? - Tom! - [laughs] Oh! - How ya doin'? - Oof! - Mmm! - How are you? - Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm glad to see you as well. - Two shots? - Two shots. All right, two shots, please. - What are you drinkin'? - [Roxana] Uh, red Martini. [laughs] - What shall we drink to? - Um... [laughs] - To diving. To the record. - Okay. Here. Here we go. Thanks. [Tom] Ugh! - Bleh! - [both laugh] You feeling stressed? Are you nervous? - You want to... - Uh, no, no, um... - What do you wanna talk about? - Uhh... [laughs] I'm a little nervous. - Mm-hm? - But... I just... I wanted, uh... to set things straight with us before the dive. [laughs] What do you mean? Maybe I made the wrong choice. You liked me first, didn't you? No. Hmm. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes, I liked you, yeah. And I think that you liked me. I'm so sorry. Ooh, you had a fight with Pascal, didn't you? Huh? He's cheating on me. Look, Roxy, it's best I don't get myself in the middle. No, but I'm not asking you to verify anything. I already know. - Everyone does. - [sighs] I really am sorry, because I... I...

[sighs] What if we took a vacation? I told you to stop worrying. We could leave all this behind for a while, just me and you. Get away from it all. - From the water... - No! - Just a little... - Quiet! Nobody treats me like I'm a child. We're not going anywhere. When things get bad, I don't run and hide.

[phone chimes] TOM I'M THINKING OF YOU ARE YOU OKAY, I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN JANUARY 2017 [woman] Thank you all for coming. Pascal Gautier and Roxana Aubry are here together, this time in the capacity of diver and coach, to take some of your questions about tomorrow's event and her record attempt. Fabrice, Canal Plus. Well, looking at you sitting there, uh... Well, I see the two best French freedivers. A living legend with more records than anyone in this sport, and a young woman who came out of nowhere and managed to beat two records in six months. And not to mention her upcoming attempt to reach 180 meters. Is there a question? - [laughter] - There is. Sorry. My question is twofold. First of all, how are you managing being in a relationship where you are constantly both in danger? And second, Roxana, could you tell us what it's like to be trained by your partner? - [shutters click] - Thank you. Everyone talks about the dangers of freediving. Actually, it's not the most dangerous, if you think about race car driving, or skiing, or rugby. I mean, even cheerleading. Do you know how many cheerleaders die while practicing that sport? - [all chuckling] - If it's a real sport. - [laughter] - [Pascal] Of course it's dangerous. But we are very careful. And we have the best safety teams in the entire world. Um... And as for the other question, for me, if there is trust and love, you always want to go further. I could have never done this without him. [Fabrice] Thank you. [motorcycle engine whirring] [chair] Another question? Nathalie, TF1. [Nathalie] Thank you. Roxana, uh... You're seen as a feminist model in the world of sports. [voice fading] So, I would like to know, as a journalist but also as a woman... [muffled] ...how you're feeling as you are about to attempt to beat a world record that used to be held by your partner. [tense music plays] - [chair] Roxana? - [music fades] A question from TF1. Sorry, could you repeat the question? Well, I was saying you're considered by many as a model of feminism, as you know, and I wanted to know how you're feeling as you're preparing... Um, sorry. Really sorry. Um... Thank you all. [whispering] Um, another question. Guillaume!

And how's she doing? She's fine. [Pascal] All right. [tense music plays] Hey. I didn't see you there. Things haven't been easy lately. - [scoffs] - [Sacha] Got it? [Stéphane] Yeah.
