What do you think? Yeah. Mom? I'm speechless! Look at you! You are the most stunning bride that I've ever seen. You're so pretty, sweetheart! Girl, you look gorgeous! Matt sure is one lucky guy. I know! You're so beautiful! I feel like crying. Fe! Dad? I'm sorry. I know this isn't what you originally wanted. Well, it's uh… I just feel it looks less, you know, than what I would've wanted. This wedding should not be ordinary. It should be remarkable. It should make a statement. Hon, it's your daughter's day! Don't mind him, my dear. I am so happy for you. For us. This is what we dreamt of and it's coming true. A happy ending! I just wish Grandma was here. Hon, we better get going. We still have a meeting with that investor at the center. - Oh. - I can manage. Change your clothes, okay? I'll just fix our things. You want some? Tricia! Oh, man! Tricia... Tricia, wait! - Boss! - You're leaving this early? Where are you going? Where else do you think? He'll find odd jobs again. I'll collect money from my debtors. And I'll buy clothes that I can sell to you. - What are you? - A loan shark? Dad! I'll go ahead. Hey! Take care! Take care of them, okay? Hey, Gabo! - Hi, Gabo! - Looking good, huh! - Hey! - Coming! Pearl, please look after the eatery today. Sure, Gabo. I got you. Gabo, you look astonishing today. Of course! Gabo, don't forget to buy me new shoes! You can have mine instead! Tricia? Tricia! Tricia, wait! Let's talk about this! Peter, stop the car! Tricia! Tri... Tricia! Hey, who's that? So pretty! Do you think she's Grandma Tere's guest? She looks like a celebrity! I don't think so! Patchot? Patchot! Patchot! Is that you? It's really you! You look gorgeous! Daisy? - Oh my God! - You're back! It's Tricia. Tricia. You're still here. Yes, we're still renting your grandma's apartment. Do you remember we used to play hide and seek and tag there when we were younger? Your timing is perfect! I'm getting married next month. You're now my maid of honor. Maid of honor? I'm just here for a vacation. I won't stay long. - Is that so? - Mm-hmm. - Let's go out before you leave. - What is it? Here's Patchot! Ta-da! Tricia! Tricia! - Hi! - What's up! - Hi! - What are you doing here? I'm here to visit Grandma. Come on in! Grandma! - Grandma! - Grandma? Tricia? Tricia! What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong, Grandma. I don't buy it. Your father didn't call me either. Well… it's Matt. He cheated on me. Ouch. But aren't you two getting married? I've been preparing for this wedding and now you're splitting up? He doesn't deserve me. Daisy, take care of my granddaughter. Tour her around. Make her happy! Make sure she forgets her ex-boyfriend! Grandma, don't worry! I'll take her to my bachelorette party! Oh… Babe? Babe? Babe. Who is he? What is he doing here, Grandma? This is Jordan. He's my boyfriend. Yeah. Jordan, this is my granddaughter, Tricia. Hi, Tricia. I'm pleased to meet you. Grandma, did you two come from the bathroom? When you're old… …sometimes there are spots you can't reach anymore. So, I asked him to scrub me. It's okay, Grandma. Too much information! Where are we exactly? Just around somewhere! Come on, sis! Faster! What? Let's go! Are you serious? You need this! This is where brokenhearted people go. Let's go! - Come on! - Let's get inside! Have a seat, ma'am. Have a seat. Perfect! Boss, they are our VIP guests. That's Ms. Daisy Santos. - Hi! - Good evening! Welcome, ma'am. Make sure we enjoy tonight. It's my bachelorette party! Of course! Perfect timing because tonight's our big night! We have a lot of surprises! I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves! Make sure she's happy tonight! Her boyfriend cheated on her back in the US. She's brokenhearted! When you see our Star of the Night, I'm sure… …you'll forget about your broken heart. - Please welcome… - You should enjoy this! …the Star of the Night! I think we should go. - Like now. - Just have fun! The show's starting! Sis! There he is! Drink up! Cheers! I love it! He's starting to dance! Whoo! Grind some more, babe! Whoo! Do it! So hot!

My name is Gabo. Gabo? I thought she said you were Hercules? Hercules? Hercules the one with the Pegasus? Oh, you meant my moves earlier? Yeah. Hercules. Nope. My real name is Gabo. - Okay. - You? It's Tricia. Are you okay, ma'am? Yeah, fine. You speak in dollars? Isn't it obvious? How will I talk to this one? She doesn't speak Tagalog! You can do it! Go! Go! - What will I say? - Ah… Ask her when did she arrive in the Philippines. Go! Ask her! Ma'am, um… Um… America. Airplane. Philippines. When? Ah… It's just this morning. - Is it okay? - Good. What else? Ask her when she's leaving. Ma'am. Philippines. Airplane. America. When? Probably in, I don't know, maybe two weeks? Two weeks? You know, ma'am, I think… you're beautiful. - Really? - Yeah. But you're… a little snobbish. Are you mad? Angry? Why? She's just sad because her boyfriend left her. Shut up! If that's the case, then you've come to the right place, ma'am. Are you open-minded? I guess. - I have a solution to your problem. - Okay. Actually, ma'am, I have a business.

And it's also stated on the contract that your safety is our priority. You better make sure that I'm getting out of this place in one piece. - Okay? - One-piece? Can you make it a two-piece? No, that's not what I meant! I meant, make sure that I get home safe! Oh. That's what you meant. - Yeah. - Don't worry. We have an honorable reputation here. We make sure that all of our guests leave this place safe and sound. You better make sure of that. And make sure nothing funny will happen between us. - Promise. - Okay. But I'm worried about you. You might not be able to control yourself. We'll charge extra for that. What? Nothing. These are your toiletries. And this is your outfit for our dinner date tonight. So, just… relax, take a shower, and doll up. I'll be back. Oh my God! Hi. Okay. Tricia. Are you ready for your special dinner by the heated pool? Food for tonight. Chicken a la poos grilled to perfeccion. Um… I really don't feel like eating dinner. I just want to unwind. Unwind? Pearl! Do you have some "unwind"? Uncle, she meant she just wants to drink. Oh, okay! Dino, bring out all the booze and snacks! On it! Don't worry, Tricia. It's unlimited. Son, lead Tricia to her seat. You look cute together. THE ULTIMATE BOYFRIEND EXPERIENCE Girl, how heavy is your problem that it made you avail yourself of this package? Yes, Tricia. If you don't mind me asking… How heavy is your problem? So, I have a fiancé. We were supposed to get married. Soon. But I caught him cheating on me. Eh… You know what? That's a common problem among our customers. They were all cheated on. That's why my son decided to put up this business because a lot of people here are going through the same thing as you. That's true! Personally, this helped me a lot to move on from my ex. I've been here for a month already but I don't want to leave because… I'll miss Papi. Can this really help you forget your problems and move on from heartbreaks? Yes. Because here, we promise to take care of your heart. We won't let you get hurt like how your boyfriend hurt you. Correct! Here, only your wallet will be in pain. Right? But let's just drink the night away. Let's stop talking about heartbreaks. Sing your heart out tonight! Get the mic. - My dear. - Wait up. Don't be shy. We're here to help you heal. Okay? Sing it out! No, thank you. - Come on. Just sing. - No, I'm good. 4-1-5-4-2 I thought she didn't want to sing? Let her be!

That's our specialty. Eat a lot, okay? How was your sleep? Good. Eat up. When did this business start? Ah. Actually, not too long ago. This was Gabo's idea. I'm so grateful for this because this has helped our family in many ways. Okay. But he also works as a, you know, gigolo at the club? He's not a gigolo. He's an entertainer. You know, Gabo is a really hardworking person. He has tried every job there is. Now he's juggling multiple jobs. - Really? - Yes. A hardworking man, indeed. You bet! Maybe because… we rely on him. All of us rely on him. And you know, our family isn't the only family he has helped. He gave everyone in this place a job. That's nice. He's one amazing man, isn't he? He truly is! I hope that whatever you are going through, All the wounds that you have, I wish they all heal soon. Um… We guarantee that you'll be completely healed before you leave this place. Just trust us and go with the flow. That's sure. Hey. Eat up! That's our specialty, especially made for you. Thank you. You better eat now because Gabo's waiting for you for your special tour. - My love? - Hmm? Hold on tight. - You might fall. - Okay. Where? Here? You have firm muscles. Not there. Wrap your arms around me. Are you sure? Yes. Hold tight. You have abs? You know what? This is Manila's breakwater. A lot of people come here. It's so peaceful here. How are you? How are you holding up? Well, I know that… I'll heal eventually. I told you. Just trust us and go with the flow, you're guaranteed to move on in two days. Okay. I thought you said three? Liar. The third day is a bonus if… …you fall in love with me. You know, my love, it boggles me why your boyfriend left you for someone else. You're pretty, talented, and smart. Why would he cheat on you? I really don't know. Maybe he found whatever was lacking with me in somebody else. If I were him… …I would never let you go. What else could I ask for, right? You're a complete package. He's so lucky. Gabo, you know, I really wish that all men were like you. Easily contented. And they appreciate what they have. I hope they're like you. The person you'll marry is one lucky girl. Why don't we make that lucky girl you? You know what? That's what I like about you. You're so funny! You know how to make me laugh. If we hadn't met this way, or if I'd been born rich and well-educated, do you think you'd have liked me? Possibly. Mm. But what if… I'm like this. This is all I have, this is me. Is it still possible for you to like me? You know Gabo, maybe… Only a stupid person won't see the goodness of your heart. I have a favor to ask. Mm? I don't want to take advantage of you or anything. But is it okay if we, even just for today, drop the pretense? Sure. Why not? Can I hold your hand? Fits perfectly! People raised abroad have warm hands, huh? Gabo, you're crazy. You're funny. I mean… Thank you. Thank you for doing this. I appreciate this. Really. You don't know how much you've helped me move on. Thank you. What does this mean? Are you two officially together now? I second that! Is this for real? Well… not yet. I'm just making the most out of it. Oh, really… Your son is an amazing tour guide! Mm. I told him earlier that this business is actually pretty good. Because it can really help people… move on. Of course, of course! Don't mention it. So, Tricia, why don't you make it official then? What now? Um… They're saying we look good together. Do you want to make this official or… I'm confused. I… Gabo, is this real, or is this still part of the package? Ah… Depends on you. But we can make it real. Excuse me. Hello, Dad? Tricia. What is happening to you? Aren't you over this… this phase? Tricia, you have to understand that men will always be men. Get back to your old life with Matt. You're causing trouble for our business! And so for our personal ties with Matt's family! And you know what that means! Get back here right away and fix what needs to be fixed! Are you okay? Um… Gabo, I need to go back home. I'm sorry. Excuse me. What are you doing here? Hi. Tricia, are you really leaving? Yeah, I need to go back to the States. I have a lot of things to fix there. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Are we going to see each other again? I really don't know. Maybe when I come back? If I will come back. So that's it, Tricia? Ah… Gabo, I only availed the package. But don't get me wrong, it really helped me a lot to forget my problems. I was happy even just for a short time. I will miss your family… …most especially the kids. Tricia, you'll be late for your flight. We have to go. Goodbye. I hope we see each other again. But what about the things we talked about? Our feelings? There were feelings involved? Why would you leave if you already have feelings for each other, Tricia? We have to go. Take care and good luck with your business. I hope it becomes more successful. You take care too. I think I have to go. Let's go. - Bye. - Take care. So, I'll close the gate. Well, the good news is… we are eligible for a grant on Assisted Living Conversion Program since we already have a license and regulation from the State. The funding will cover physical conversion of our existing project units, common and service areas, as well as unit configuration and any necessary remodeling consistent with the State's regulation. All we need to do is to submit an application and wait for their approval. Good job, my dear. I knew I could count on you. Now go to our facility in Lancaster and fix what needs to be fixed. Yes, Dad. Excuse me. Tricia? Hey, Trish. Tricia! - Can we talk? - About? About us. - There's nothing to talk about, Matt. - Tricia, come on. I believe we should make up. Put everything behind us. Move forward and continue with our plans. You know, like getting married, building our own family… You know what? I've got news for you. Yeah? It's over. This is ridiculous! I told you we should talk about this. Tricia, what happened? Why did Matt look so mad when he left? The nerve of that guy! He talks as if he didn't do anything wrong to me. So, there's really no way to fix this? No! No chance at all! Are you sure about that? - Yes. - Oh! That smile means something. I'm curious as to what it means. Seems like something good happened in the Philippines. Actually, it's weird. It's cute. It's a funny experience. When I was in Manila I met a… stripper at a club. And then? I think I fell for him. But... Because I'm happy whenever I'm with him. I forgot about my problems with Matt and my family. I can't explain it. Tricia. Stripper. Stripper. I… But he's different. He's helpful and kind to his family. And to his neighbors! I'm so sure you'd love him when you meet him. I just know that I miss him so much. I miss his antics. I miss how I am when I'm with him. Okay. Thank you. - Hello? - My love! I miss you! G-Gabo? Why are you calling with a US number? Didn't I tell you I would do anything to see you again? So I flew here! When can I see you? Oh! Um… I don't know. I'm a little busy at work. Can I see you tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'm not sure because I have a meeting tomorrow night. Please, my love. Even just for a while. I'd be happy even with just a glimpse of you. Mm… Okay, fine. Just tell me where. Okay. I miss you! I love you! Bye! Okay. Bye. Who was that? It's Gabo. He's here in the US. What? Mm. Yikes! So what's your plan? I don't know. Wait. I have an idea. - We're here! Let's go! - Yay! Come on. We're home, my dear cousin. Ma! Gabo's here! - Auntie! - Gabo! Cousin! Welcome to America! Auntie! How are you? - Hey! - Cousin! Come on, let's eat and drink! Get some beer! - Get him a glass. - Here. Eat first! You must be hungry. Finally! I'm here in America! How was your trip? Ah… What's the word? Bumpy. You're finally here, cuz. What's your plan? Are you staying here for good? I don't know yet. My priority is to see my girlfriend. Did I hear you right? You have a girlfriend here? My cousin is indeed a ladies' man! Is she Filipina or American? Filipina. Smells sweet for sure! But most importantly, a kind lover! - There you go. - Where's your girlfriend from? Inchino? - Inchino? Encino! - Encino. - Encino. - Wow! Only rich people live there. That's true. That's a rich neighborhood. Wait. So, you're just gonna do that and then get out of here? Ah… What did he say? He was asking if you're just going to that and leave right after. Well, I might tour the city since I'm here. But I'll definitely see her first. And let's see what America has in store for me. If you want, we can endorse you to our boss. You can work there for the time being. - Right? - Yes. Sure. I'll accept any help you can offer. - No problem. - Very good. There are lots of opportunities here in America. Just don't be picky! I'm not and I'm hardworking! - Tricia! - Hi! - Cousin, that's Tricia. - Hi. Wow! Tricia, this is my cousin Rolly. - Hi. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Cuz, just text me when you're done. I'll pick you up. - Okay, cuz. I'll text you. - Okay. I'm so glad you could make it. Come on in. This way. Let's go! Tricia, your house is like a palace. Gabo? Before we go in, can we spice things up first? What? Come on. Where? Follow me. - This early? - Mm-hmm. Over here? Over here. Come on. - Tricia. - Mm. - Are you sure about this? - Yeah. Relax. This will be quick. Are you sure? I knew it! I know her style! Oh my God! Oh! What is it? What are you doing? You said we'd spice things up first. Yeah, but what I meant was to spice up your look. - Change my clothes? - Mm. Fe, where's Tricia? She's coming. Who's that? May I have your attention, please? I would like to introduce to you my friend from Manila, Mr. Gabriel Madlangbayan. You may call him Gabo. Okay. - Thank you, Marvin. - Of course. Enjoy! Let's eat! Um, so, Gabriel, right? Yes. Gabriel, how did you and Tricia meet? He was introduced by Daisy. Daisy who? Dad, remember Daisy, my childhood friend? They're the ones renting grandma's apartment. - Daisy. - Oh yeah. - Oh, I remember Daisy. - Yeah, I remember. Daisy. So, Gabriel, what are you busy with nowadays? Actually… He has a good variety of businesses, Dad. - Wow. - What kind of businesses is he into? H-he has a lot. - Yeah! - Like what? Um… He has a holistic wellness facility. - Oh! Good. - Yes. Same nature of our business. And not only that, he also manages bars and restaurants. And he finances start-up businesses. Wow! Young entrepreneur. You seem to have a lot on your plate. Thank you. He's a business tycoon in Manila, Dad. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Wow! I've never come across your name in the biz. Me neither. Ooh. Really? I'm a famous entertainer in the Philippines. What? I thought you said he was a businessman? No, he meant… He's into the entertainment industry. He also manages talents. - Yes! - Mm. I have a lot of talents. - Oh! - Yes! I'm a dancer. Model. Sometimes, I'm a… cowboy. A fireman. Policeman. Superman. But most of the time, I'm a… lover. Romantic. How was my acting earlier? Ah… Gabo, it was okay. But honestly… I hope you let me answer everything. Why? Did I say anything wrong? I just told them the truth. I am an entertainer and a lover boy. Yes, yes. I understand. But it was your first time meeting my parents and our business partners. I just didn't want them to get shocked. Do your parents dislike me? Coffee, anyone? Oh, no, thank you, Linda. We really have to be going. - Okay. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. No, thank you, Walter and Linda. It was a lovely dinner. And see you at work tomorrow. My son, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm okay. See you guys. Walt. Linda. Tricia. Gabriel. It was… interesting to meet you. Come on. Let's go. Bye. - We're gonna go. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Good night. - Bye. Tricia, it's late. I think your friend should leave. Tricia, your dad is right. It's late. Let's call it a night. Time to rest, Gabriel. Tricia, I'll go ahead. Your parents seem tired. Please tell them I went ahead. Okay. Okay. I'll walk you out. No, it's fine. Maybe my cousin's already outside waiting for me. Thank you for the dinner. - Gabo… - It's okay. - Are you sure? - Yes. I wish to see you again. Bye. Things are really like that here. We're not treated equally. Especially if you haven't achieved anything yet. That's what I felt earlier. I felt like nobody wanted me there. Especially her parents. Cuz, I think you'll have a hard time with your girlfriend. She's beautiful and rich. Looks like you'll have to go through the eye of a needle to get her parents' approval. We were gonna go out to find work for him. But if you want to go out, it's okay. We can reschedule. Gabo, somebody's here to see you. I'll leave you two to talk. Um… I came here to apologize. Sorry for what happened last night. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. I'm worried you got offended. I'm sorry. It's okay. I understand where your parents are coming from. And maybe I'm just not really suitable for fancy gatherings. N-no, it's not like that, Gabo. Ah, maybe they were just surprised because they don't know you. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Mm… Can I invite you out? Where? Remember when we were in Manila you toured me around? And then I told you that if you ever visit the US, I will do the same for you. So, do you want to come with me? Let's go? - Okay… - Let's go. So, this is the Dockweiler beach, and then we're off to the Santa Monica beach. - Wow! - There's also Santa Monica Pier. It has a carnival with rides and games. - Okay, right? - It's so beautiful here! Mm-hmm. Ricky Martin! - And those are the names of the... - The doors! Look at the mascot! You may take a picture with them! Let's take a picture with them later! Welcome to Hollywood! America is really big! The Philippines is just a spec compared to the US. You wanna walk somewhere else? Let's go! It's so beautiful here! Tricia, I've been meaning to… ask you something, but… I'm shy. Okay. I've been thinking about why I flew all the way here just to see you. And I think the reason is that I want to know if you meant it when you said back home that you also have feelings for me. Wow! Um… Okay. You know, Gabo, honestly, I don't know. I didn't expect that I would develop feelings for you. Because… you're just different from everyone else. I can see that you have a good and pure heart. And your drive to succeed… You're just so passionate about everything. And most of all, I love how you take care of your family. I mean, I don't think I can ever find another man like you. So does that mean… we're officially together? Isn't… Isn't it a little bit too fast? Tricia, we're not kids anymore. And isn't what's important is our feelings for each other? Well, let's just go with the flow. Go with the flow? I'm okay with that. I want to apologize again for what happened last night. I'm really embarrassed about how my parents treated you. You see, they didn't have it easy to achieve everything that they have now. That's why they're so protective of me. You really don't have to apologize. I understand. I promise you that… I will work hard to make you proud. So you can introduce me to your parents with pride. - Um… - Mm-hmm. Tricia, are you… - What? - Officially… My girlfriend now? Gabo, I thought we agreed to take it slow? But I traveled really far. Can I get one… Mm. Look at the sign. It used to be "Hollywood Land", but they dropped the "land". - Really? - They just retained "Hollywood". The sign looks okay even without the word "land". Hollywood so... Come in, cuz! This is where we work. Come on. Dude. Miss Ruby. Hey. This is the guy I've been telling you about. Meet my cousin, Gabo. Good morning. Good morning. You're the one looking for a job? Yes. Are you good in the kitchen? Yes. Do you know how to clean? I do. Okay. You can start today. Nice, cuz! You're hired! You can save money now! Give him a mop and a broom so he can start with the kitchen. - Let's go. - Let's go! Bro, are you new here? Yes. I just got here. Immigrant? N-not yet. Tourist. Ah. So you don't have proper documentation? None yet. Woah! What is this? It's pork adobo, sir. I said fork. We didn't order pork. He doesn't eat pork. How would we eat the food when we don't even have utensils? I just want a simple fork! Sir, you said pork adobo. Excuse me, sir. Is there any problem, sir? I asked for a fork. A fork? I don't want pork adobo. - You mean fork. - Yeah, a fork. Cuz, he wants a fork, the utensil. Get one inside. I'll deal with them. - Right away, sir. - Okay! - Sorry. - Thank you. Just wait for him. We've been waiting for him. We've been here for ten minutes. Give me one of those. What's that? Well… The customer is sending it back. Did he say why? He said he didn't want pork adobo. He wants a fork. My goodness, Gabo! A fork? It's simple English yet you don't understand? I'm sorry, Miss Ruby. Hello, son? How's everything there? How's Tricia? Everything's good here, Dad. And everything's okay with Tricia. You know, Dad, I have good news for you. I scored an awesome job. Wow! That's great! So, did Tricia's family like you? Will there be a wedding soon? Yes, Dad. Tricia's parents adore me. They said I'm so nice and they're really impressed with my talents. - That's great to hear, son. - Dad. When Tricia and I get married, I'll bring you and Dino here. So we can all live here. Son, that's your father's wish. That we'll always be together. Ah… Dad, I have to go. I'm a little busy at work. I'll call you again. Okay, son. Take care over there. Don't forget to pray! Love you. Okay. Love you. And you take care too. Gabo! - Tricia! - Have you been waiting long? Not too much. Sit down. Sorry. I had to finish a lot of things at the office. It's okay. Mm! I got my first salary. I'm so sorry I didn't get you anything. You didn't have to. I should be the one getting things for you. I'm sorry if this is all I can afford. No. It's okay. This is so sweet. Thank you. Ah! Cheers? - Cheers! - Cheers! ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ You're the beautiful one for me ♪ - Let's watch. - Sure. Where are you two from? - Philippines. - The Philippines? - Mabuhay! - Mabuhay! Are you together? A little bit. A little bit? Oh. I have something very special for both of you. It's a Filipino song. I'm dedicating it to both of you. - Oh! I know this song. - Mm? ♪ Now that I'm with you ♪ ♪ My heart's no longer blue ♪ ♪ Whatever people say ♪ ♪ My feelings for you won't ever change ♪ ♪ Day and night ♪ ♪ I still love you ♪ ♪ Don't need anyone but you ♪ ♪ For the rest of my life ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ The only one ♪ ♪ I want to ♪ ♪ Be with ♪ Tricia, I fear that your parents won't like me. Is that final? We have to take things slow? Mm-hmm. N.O.? Mm-hmm. N.O. Now official! - Now official? - Mm-hmm. So are we official now? Mm… - You don't want? - I do! Glad you made it. Is this Michelle? It is. - Hi everyone! What's up? - And the wine… - How are you? - It's really good. Linda. Happy birthday. Where are your mom and dad? They're on the... They're on the way. Walt, you're gonna want to take a look at this. This is a 25-year-old wine. Courtesy, of course, Walter. Cheers! Hi, everybody! - Hi! This is Gabo. - Good evening. Hi. Come. Hi, Mom. Happy birthday! Sorry, we're late. Hi, Auntie. - Happy birthday. - Remember Gabo? Hi, Dad. You've met Gabo, right? Sir. Dad! You think you had us fooled all this time? We know who you really are! - Dad, what is going on? - And you're only after… one thing from Tricia and I'm not gonna allow this. Don't make a scene. It's my birthday, please. For me? Gabo! Gabo! Gabo, wait. Gabo, wait! Please. I just want to apologize about what happened back there. I'm so sorry. It's fine. What they said was true, anyway. They're right. I don't believe them, Gabo. I believe in what I feel. And I feel that you love me. I love you too, Gabo. Tricia, if you love me, I wish you can fight for me. I wish you can stand up for us. Because I am ready to fight for you. Gabo, wait! Dad. You are mistaken. You don't know who Gabo is. He is a good man. And he makes me very happy. I'm loved by Gabo. That's unbelievable, Tricia. It was so ignorant of you to not notice that he's just after your stature. Look who's talking! The audacity, Matt! You've clearly forgotten what you've done to me, you spoiled selfish cow! Ow. Oh my God. Gabo? Why aren't you sleeping yet? Is there a problem? Did you and Tricia fight? I don't know what will happen to us. Is it because of her parents? They already know about my background. They found out about your work? I don't understand. What's so wrong with being a stripper? I didn't choose that. It's just that I didn't have any other choice. It's better, right? Than doing something illegal. Is that so wrong? There's nothing wrong with it. But you know that not everyone finds stripping acceptable. Especially people like Tricia's family. I don't know what to say. All I know is that you're not a bad person. And that Tricia's parents are wrong for judging you just because of your job. Tricia? My dear? Where are you going? You're leaving? Are you moving out? You're going with that good-for-nothing man? Tricia! Why? Do you want to be like your grandmother? You're going to throw all these away? Fine! Leave! But if you leave, forget that we are your parents! And don't ever come back to this house again! I swear to God, I will cut you off of everything! And I am sure you'll come back here on your knees begging! Dad, you're wrong about Gabo. Tricia! Tricia! Patricia! Tricia! Tricia! Here it is. This is the place. Hey. We're here. Welcome home! So, what do you think of this place? Tricia, isn't this… Too big for the two of us? I'm sure the rent is expensive. Gabo, come here. You don't have to worry about anything. I'm here. We'll help each other. Don't worry. My love, didn't I tell you that you don't have to work anymore? We will never ask for help from your parents. I want to prove to them that I can take care of you. You understand me, right? Mmm… Okay. Let's unpack our stuff. Come on. Hello? Good morning, sir! Is this ICE? Yes, sir. I would like to report an illegal worker. He's working as a busboy. Yes, sir. His name is Gabriel Madlangbayan. Thank you, sir. What? You jerk! You ratted out our cousin! I don't know what you're talking about! Let me go! Move! Go, cuz! Punch him! Are you crazy? Let me go! That's the problem with some of us Filipinos. We pull each other down. Why? It's true that you don't have proper documents! You snitch! I will sue you! Go, cuz! Leave! ICE will be here soon. Go! We'll take care of him! Hi! I thought you were working late? I don't have a job anymore. - What? - I left the restaurant. Why? What happened? One of the workers reported me to ICE. Oh my! And then what happened? I punched him! Gabo, you might get sued! He can sue me all he wants! Gabo, this is the US. Things are different here. You can be jailed or worse, you can get deported. And you don't have proper documentation. I don't care! Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? Not anymore. I lost my appetite. Let's be real. Your situation with Gabo is really difficult. Trish, you won't survive if you just rely on him. I know, but Gabo doesn't want me to work because he wants to prove to my mom and dad that he's not after my money. I have an idea. Marry him! Right! Marry him so he can work here legally. Plus, he'll be able to get higher-paying jobs. What if he only wants to get American citizenship? Get that American dream? You're too judgmental, Vivian. That's not true. I can see that Gabo really loves Tricia. He's really doing everything he can to take care of Tricia. I can see that. That's what I admire about Filipino men - their principles. - What's your order, sir? - Can I have lechon? Nineteen dollars, sir. Thank you! - Thank you. - Thank you. What is it? We're short. - What? - We're short. By how much? Two hundred and twenty dollars. That's pretty big. Who was the last one to man the cash register? Gabo! Come here. Sir? Did you know that we're short? Were you the cashier earlier? Do you even know how to use this? Sir, it's a little different from what we use back home. You're stupid! - Butch! - Sir. Why, sir? I don't want to see your cousin tomorrow. Why would you recommend someone stupid? How much again? Fifteen hundred dollars. My love. Hi, Gabo. You're early. Ah… I lost my job again. Why? What happened this time? I think I gave the customer the wrong change. My boss doesn't want me to come back anymore. Hey. My love, by the way, our monthsary's near. Where do you want to go? Where do you want to celebrate? Gabo, how can you think of celebrating? I mean, we haven't paid our rent to Vivian. We still haven't paid our bills for the gas company and the electricity company. We're running out of groceries. How can we celebrate? I'll find a job soon. My cousins will help me. Life isn't as easy here, Gabo. I hope you ponder on that. Tricia! Hey, cuz. What's wrong? Why is your face like that? It's our monthsary. But I can't take Tricia out because I don't have enough money. As a matter of fact, we're really tight on finances right now. Cuz, why don't you let Tricia go back to work? Cuz, I am the man. It's my responsibility to take care of her. Oh. Don't worry, cuz. We'll take care of your monthsary. Don't forget that we're here in the kitchen. Food's on us tonight. Okay. Go back to your station. - The manager might see you here. Go. - Thank you. You good? Hey, Tricia. I was able to find one and it's work from home. Grab it! I'm not sure. What if Gabo finds out? He'll get mad. Patricia, how else will you survive? I know! Fe, just between us, we're actually running out of groceries. We also haven't paid rent to Vivian. I really don't know what to do. Look for a job because you need to help Gabo. Yeah. I need to help him. - Thanks, Fe. Bye. - Okay bye. Our newly appointed CEO, my son, Matt. - Cheers! - Cheers! Congrats, son! Don't let us down, Matt. Not on my watch, Walt. That's my son! Everyone, thank you. Let's enjoy dinner. Are you guys hungry? Here we go. Sushi boat! Wow! - Goodness! - Thank you! This is so good. - I'm excited to eat. - Hey! Hey, you! - The nerve of this guy! - What? What the hell are you doing here? Of all the people I had to see, it had to be you! Vivian. How are you able to even work here? Right! You are going to cause big trouble for this place. Just like what you did to my family! Especially my daughter! I'd like to see your manager, please. Sure thing, sir. Can you please stop? Look! Everybody's looking at us. Are you the manager? Yes, sir. I'm sure you're aware about hiring illegal workers here. If you're not going to do anything about this, I will call ICE myself. - I'll take care of it. - Just do it. This guy has no place in this... Let's go. Hey! Where are you going? Leave him alone! Take care of this mess. Don't drag me into this! Cuz, leave. Go back to the Philippines. If Tricia's dad calls ICE, we might get in trouble too. If ICE catches you, you'll be detained for sure. And we might get in trouble too. I can't go home. I can't leave Tricia. Cuz, leave! Go! ICE might catch you here. - There. There he is. - Stop! Don't move. Cuz, run! Wait! Tricia? Gabo! I'm taking a shower! You're looking for a job? Didn't I tell you that I will take care of us? But, Gabo, we have to be practical. We're falling behind on payments. We barely have food in the fridge. If you don't let me work, how will we survive? - Why? - I want to help you! Are you ashamed of me? What? No! Of course not! Is it because I can't afford this apartment? Is it because we're worlds apart? Is it because your parents still can't accept me? What do my parents have to do with this? Because your parents reported me to ICE! I feel like I'm forcing myself into this place. Like I'm forcing myself into this country. No matter how hard I try, it's never enough. I'm never enough. Honestly, I even feel like I'm forcing myself into our relationship. You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe we're just forcing ourselves to make this work! You know what, Gabo? This isn't the Philippines, okay? We can't adjust to the principles you hold so dearly! If that's the case… Then what are we still doing here? What are we sacrificing and adjusting for here? You said it yourself. Maybe I'm the only one who wants to make this work. You know what? I think we should just end this. I'm not enough for you. You'll just suffer. You'll just suffer with me. Because I don't equate to anything in this country. Do you hear yourself? You know what? You're so unfair! And maybe you're right. Fine! You just gave me an idea! You're right! I'll go back to my parents because there, my life is so much easier! My life has a direction! I'm not imprisoned in a room like this! Gabo, I'm a learned woman. I cannot always just do what you want me to. Don't I have a say in this relationship too? You said you loved me, right? So why are you giving up already? If that's how you feel about this relationship, fine. I think it would be best if… you called your parents tomorrow and asked them to come and pick you up. Gabo, please no. I choose you. Let's end this. Such a waste, cuz! You're already here. Are you really just going to throw your dreams away because of Tricia? Well, you guys are right. Tricia is the only reason why I came here. There are a lot of women that you can replace Tricia with. And even more beautiful than Tricia. That's not it. Not all Filipinos who come here get lucky. I hope you don't lose hope. Thank you, everyone. But… I've made up my mind. Back home, I feel like I have worth. I feel like I'm smart there. And my family needs me too. Back home, I know I'm happy. America isn't for me. What about Tricia, cuz? Does she know you're going back home to the Philippines? Gabo, have a safe flight. Gabo, I hope you can come back here. Thank you very much. Don't mention it, cuz. Bye. Gabo. Cousin. We have to go. You might miss your flight. Give them some rice. They... Oh, right. Gabo! Trish. Trish, are you okay? I don't know what to do, Fe. I just… I miss Gabo so much. It looks like your daughter really loves Gabo. Why don't we let her be happy? Hi, Gabo. What are you doing here? I'm here because… I'm choosing you. Because I know that I'll only be happy with you. You're the man, Gabo! You're my idol!
