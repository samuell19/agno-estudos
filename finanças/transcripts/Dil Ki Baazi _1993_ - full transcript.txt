Don't you know how to drive? You were driving on the wrong side. No, it was you who was driving on the wrong side. - Moreover, it's such a rickety car! - How can you say that? Even superstars like Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna have driven in it. - Don't you bluff! - Don't you dare touch me! What are you doing? - What did you say? - Don't you beat me! This fellow is drunk and he is beating me. What's your problem? Who are you to interfere? You were driving while drunk! Get lost, will you? You had better behave decently. My car banged. I suffered a loss. Who are you to interfere? You're beating a lonely man. He's the one at fault. - Get lost! - You get lost! What's going on? Arrest both of them. You'll forget hooliganism once you spend a night in jail. - What happened? - They were quarreling on the street. Go ahead. It's me speaking, Dad. What's the matter, Ajay? I'm speaking from the Chembur Police Station. But you had gone to a function? Yes. But en route, the car met with an accident... ...and I quarreled with a rogue. And the police brought me here. Let me speak to the Inspector. This is Vishwanath Kashyap speaking. Nothing serious, sir. No, you don't have to come here. Why don't you tell me before that you're his son? You may leave. It would be better for you if we don't meet again. Come in. - What's your name? - Vijay. - What work do you do? - I'm searching for a job. You got down to hooliganism since you didn't get work? - I was only... - Shut up. What's your father's name? Nirmaladevi. Are you short of hearing? I've asked for your father's name, not your mother's. Mother! Don't be surprised, Inspector. I'm his father and mother too. I've raised him, got him educated. The affection and love that he didn't get from his father... ...I have given him. I have faced several hardships in bringing him up. I've given him the right to use my name in place of his father's. Do you have any objection? None at all. I have understood everything. Look, dear... It's not befitting for decent people to be arrested by the police. Do you want your mother to undergo hardships? No. - You were amazing! - That's all right. The girl is scintillating. I think I will win her over. - What will happen of me? - Get lost from here. Didn't I pay you to accompany me? She's gone. Tell me now. Don't worry. I will find out everything about her. How wonderful! Ms Asha, please come here. What is it, Mr. Vijay? Don't you know that one should knock before entering inside? Perhaps you don't know that in today's times... ...one should walk in straight, rather than knocking on a door. What are you doing? Searching for a job in the newspapers. At your age, one searches for a girlfriend. At this age, neither do I get a girlfriend, nor a job. - Where's Auntie? - In the kitchen. What's the matter? I had brought 500 rupees. Keep it. I got the money in a program. - I've found out, sir. - What have you got to know? - About that girl. The singer. - Really? You? Hop over. I'll drop you. No, thank you. I will take the bus. Please come. All right. - Where are you going? - To work. - Early in the morning? - Work commences in the morning. That's right. But your work starts in the night, isn't it? The show is in the night. And rehearsals in the mornings. You perform shows every day? I get a couple of shows in a fortnight. What's your rate? I get at least a thousand bucks for a program. - It's dirt cheap. - What? I mean... the program is very reasonably priced at 1000. If a girl like you demands even 5000, people would gladly give you. Why increase the rates? I would even lose the assignments in hand. - With me around, why worry? - You too perform shows? If you hadn't helped me that night, my program would've gone haywire. It means you didn't dislike my association? - Dislike? I like it very much. - Really? - In fact, I wanted to thank you. - I accept your thanks. Now you should accept something from me too. How about something to mark our new friendship? What a car! Here... your drink. What is this? It's a drink. It's not Indian, but Scotch. I considered you to be a decent and respectable person. But the liquor has made me look down upon you. You see... you are... Give me the breakfast quickly. - Vijay, the breakfast is ready. - I'm coming, mother. - Sit and eat, will you? - I don't have the time. You should eat slowly. Here, drink water. It's 8 o'clock. It's raining heavily too. If I don't get the bus in time, I'll be late for the interview. - I'm leaving. - Wait. What now, mother? - Here. - What's this? It's raining heavily. Take a taxi. Taxi! Taxi! Wait... wait! - What is it? - Will you go to Sion? Why not? You want to sit in the front seat? Why? Do you have any objection? Sit here for a minute. I'll drink tea and return. Go ahead. It's a strange taxi. There's always something wrong with them. You are truly amazing! Switch off the radio. Yes, of course. Right away. Put down the meter and take me to Sion. I cannot touch the meter. Won't you get going? I can go anywhere you take me. But I'm helpless right now. You will have to take me. I'll have to deal with you sternly. Constable! Call the constable. If you like, call the soldier too. What's the matter, madam? - You see... - Nothing. Nothing has happened. Shut up! Don't interrupt. - What happened? - The child began weeping. Shut up! - What happened? - I want to go to Sion. - But he's not taking me there. - You should take her. - But... - Shut up! - You should take her. - Listen to me first. - What do you have to say? - I don't have a license. The passenger is in the taxi, but the license is not there? What's happened, sir? He's refusing to take the girl to Sion. And he doesn't have a license. But he's my passenger. I'm the taxi driver. - Why didn't you say before? - You didn't give me a chance. Shut up, there's no point in a chance. This is what confused the matter. I'm sorry. Madam, I cannot do a thing about this. I'm also going to Sion. If you don't mind, I will give you a lift. I don't want your favour. It's raining heavily. And it won't be easy finding a taxi quickly. Why don't we split the fare between ourselves? - Always think of the future. - No, I will pay the full fare. Both of you may pay me the full fare. - Where's the GM's office? - Up there. If I call for one person, three shouldn't come. But there's only one person. No nonsense. Go and fetch tea for me. Hey! The phone has got broke. - Whom do you want? - I want Daulat (wealth). There's no wealth here. But this is Daulatram here. Mr. Daulatram, this is Babulal here. Mr. Babulal? You are sending me the payment, aren't you? - Yes. - By the way... I've sent an additional 2000 bottles. - Send me the payment in cash. - All right. - I suppose everything else is fine. - Yes. What's the matter? You are laughing a lot today. I'm not laughing. I am coughing. They find my cough to be a laugh. Tea! - You've delayed so much! - I've come on time. Does it take so much time to fetch tea? I'm not your tea-boy. Where're my spectacles? On the forehead. How can my glasses be on your forehead? Not mine. Yours. All right. - Who are you? - I've come for the interview. No interviews today. The boss is unwell. All those who had come for the interview have been sent back. - Does our time have no value? - What do you mean? You are the general manager. You too can take interviews. Have you come here to take interviews? - You see... - Go away, will you? Here's the tea, sir. Have you eaten anything since this morning? - No. - Then drink this milk. Mr. Daulatram, come home with the accounts for the month of March. All right. Sarita... listen. Are you hell-bent upon interrupting me whenever I leave home? What's your problem? Did you take a cash sum of 25,000 bucks from the factory? Is the 25,000 rupees causing your business to run into losses? I'm only talking about accounts. Then go ahead with it. I don't have time. I'm not feeling well. Is it necessary that you should go? What's wrong with your health? Do you want me to massage your head if you have a cough or cold? If you wish, you may appoint a servant for this work. But please spare me. Let there be peace at home. Don't you be after Daddy's blood all the while? Your daddy is after my blood, not I. He doesn't like accompanying me to some club or a party. If you don't like it, sit at home. But let me lead my life my own way. Hello, brother. Let's leave, Ritu. Mummy won't change at her age. You yourself realize it. Please don't get tense. - Did you take the medicine today? - Yes. Mr. Ajay, it will take us one-and-a-half hours to reach there. - Please hurry up. - Ah, yes. Take out the car. I'll come right away. - Are you going out? - Yes. To a function. - You may leave. - All right. Mr. Daulatram, where are you going? Come here. Where are you going, sir? I'm not your boss. I'm Ajay. Your boss is in there. Hey! Why're you going there? Your boss is over there. - He appears so lean. - What a strange character! - Here it is, sir. - Let me see it. How is it that a thousand to two thousand bottles... ...are broken every month? It's because of the mode of transport. The bottles bang against each other, and so... Then change the mode of transport. Otherwise I'll have to change you. - What? - Yes. It's because of your elder brother that I've appointed you a GM. Otherwise you don't deserve even to be a clerk. Go and get down to work now. Greetings. The door is that way. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Let me introduce you. She's Ms Lalita. And he's Mr. Santosh. Why look towards her? She's already crossed the limits. - She's Mrs. Vishwanath, isn't she? - Yes. - They were in Nagpur, isn't it? - Do you know them since earlier? Yes. What do they do here? The cold-drink company belongs to them. Vachchani, you're well-informed. You are a useful person. 'Santosh! Even Lalita couldn't recognize you today' 'Lalita, the one whom you were to be married to' 'Her scoundrel, affluent father got her married to Vishwanath... ' '... and all your efforts were wasted' 'Because then, people knew you as a Mr. Bhogilal' 'You killed her father thereafter. You were arrested... ' '... and hanged to death. But you escaped from the jail. And today... ' '... with the aid of plastic surgery... ' '... you've a new identity as Santosh. Bhogilal was dead for good' 'An Inspector had recognized you, but... ' You've a strong knack for recognizing people... ...and I admire this quality. What will you take? Would you take it weekly, monthly, or yearly? - Your crimes are enormous. - Then demand a greater sum. I want a million rupees. - Is it decided then? - Yes. Come in, then. 'Now I've to settle a score with Lalita' There's a meeting at the women's institution tomorrow. This institution inculcates a feeling of self-respect among women... ...who have been oppressed and exploited by society... ...so that they can serve the society and country. I donate a sum of 30 rupees towards the association. - Announce a figure of 100,000. - I donate a sum of 100,000 rupees. Greetings. Mr. Santosh... let me introduce you to sister Nirmaladevi. She's in-charge of the entire institution. She's executing the responsibility since the past 15 years. A garden with a good gardener would naturally remain green. All her qualities can be seen on her face. She has love, compassion, mercy, decency, attraction... - We've to attend another meeting. - We've to attend another meeting. All right, then. Goodbye. Come, Mr. Santosh. I will see him off. - All right. - Greetings. Don't worry. I'm there. All the women in this institution aged between 18 to 24 years... ...are, in fact, the interest of your investments. If you wish, I will send you your daily interest to your home. - Behari! Behari! - Yes, sir? - Where were you? - I was thinking something. Where are my spectacles? What will you give me if I tell you? Blessings. - Sir... darkness under the lamp? - What do you mean? The spectacles are on the forehead. Not mine. Yours. I am there. A thank you won't do. You'd better clear the dues. It cannot be cleared because I've fixed it in a fix deposit. Am I babbling nonsensically? Don't babble nonsensically. Just beat me. Come on. How many times have I told you to address me as Papa! - Remember, you'd promised me today?! - Which promise? That you would get me a car from Murli Motor Training School. I didn't make any such promise. - I want a car. - But I won't get it for you. - You won't get me a car? - I won't. In that case, I will stop eating food. - I mean it, papa! - I too mean it! - But where are you going? - To the factory. - The door is over there. - Listen, papa! - Sir! - Shut up! Stop the car! You jumped the signal! - I cannot see. - Then how do you drive a car? - By guesswork. - By guesswork? You'll have to pay a fine of 100 rupees. Give me 25 rupees. What for? Do you want to pay 100 rupees to the government... ...or 25 rupees to the constable? Who's your Inspector General? Mr. Agarwal. Why do you ask? - Know who I am? - I don't care a damn. Just give me 25 rupees. I am the Inspector General Agarwal's brother-in-law. Such a trick won't work on me. Come with me. I will take you to Mr. Agarwal. Why? That won't be necessary. You may proceed. Now you will have to pay me 50 rupees. - I? - Yes. Fine for stopping me. - You must be joking. - Do you want to meet Mr. Agarwal? No, no... I will pay you. Hurry up. From the various hawkers... Now hold your ears and say that you'll never stop my car. I hold my ears and say that I'll never stop your car. What a man he is! He collected money from me! Aarti dear! - You know... I want that... - Over here! I hear that you haven't eaten since morning. Is it true? Don't be stubborn. Let's eat food. - I won't. I won't. - Shall I make tea for you, sir? My daughter hasn't eaten since morning. And you talk of tea? - Get out of my sight. - All right. - I too haven't eaten since morning. - So? Whatever you like, will be done. - You will get me a car? - Yes. But tomorrow. - Shall we eat food now? - Yes. - What happened, father? - What has happened? - My leg has been fractured. - O Father! Let's get down and see what has happened. - Who's screaming? - Not there. Over here. Why is he screaming from up above? It's the one below who is screaming. What are you doing, papa? What is he doing lying on the ground? He broke his leg by being run over by our car. But what are you doing down there? - You broke my father's leg! - I broke his leg? - Yes. - Is he mad or what? - Take me to my doctor. - Yes. Right away. Hurry up. He has to be taken to the hospital. You should hurry up. Why should I hurry? One needs money for that. Money? What for? Here... 50 rupees. 50 rupees? But this is only 2 rupees. What should I do? I've only that much money. - Police! Where's the police? - Just a minute. - Here's 100 rupees. - But this is only 5 rupees? - What are you doing? - Here's 100 rupees. Get up, father. We've got it. It would be better if you employ a driver. Are you mad? Who will pay for the driver? Instead, let's teach our Behari to drive. He will cook as well as drive. But will he continue with us with so much work-burden? Yes, of course. - What're you doing? - Driving the car. The car is down there. Let's go. We've made an earning. Hey! Look! He's walking away! - Who? - Over there! Let him go. Stop. Welcome, Mr. Daulatram. - Who is she? - She's my daughter. - What's her name? - Aarti. - Do you want to learn driving? - Yes. Will you drive this car after you learn driving? Why? Is this not a car? - Is this a car? - What do you mean? I mean... what a car this is! I won't drive this car. If it stops, I will have to dance in front of it. Dance? Is this a musical car? Shut up, will you? Let me handle the situation. - We don't want a new car. - Papa, we want a new car! Why don't you have a look at the cars? I even deal in cars. - Where are the cars? - The garage is close by. - Be seated. Behind. - The steering is down there. Stop! Stop! You drive the car like a blind man! Please come. This way. Look at the car. - What a nice car this is! - This car is very... It's like a Taj Mahal compared to your car. One just looks at the Taj Mahal. One doesn't drive it. But this vehicle works on diesel. - I want this car. - But you can't drive. - I will learn how to drive. - I will teach her. Not you. I want a girl who will teach her driving. - We don't have a girl. - Then what should we do? But there is an old man! He's his father. - His father? What is his age? - He'll die in a couple of days. - Will she learn driving in 2 days? - Yes, why not? - All right, then. - Do come back soon. - Where's my father? - I will create one. Here... Welcome, Ms Aarti. It's nice that you've come. - Shall we start? - What? - The training. - Yes, of course. - O Old man! - Old man? The driver is an old man. Old man! Come quickly, old man! - The girl has to be taught. - Teach what? - Driving. - I see. - Let's go. - Hey! - Shall we start? - Will you sit on the same seat? Sit there. Come. Be seated. - Have you ever driven a car? - Yes, Uncle. I had banged father's car once by driving it back-and-forth. Bravo! Well done. Put the car into neutral gear. - How should I do that? - Like this. Start the car now. Now press the clutch and put it into first gear. Uncle, which one is the clutch? This one. Press it. Now put the car into first gear. How should I put it into first gear, Uncle? Why do you address me as Uncle? Here... drive it. Slow down... slow down. Enough... go slow. How is your love car doing? Every now and then, she addresses me as Uncle. How else would she address a person with a gray beard? Hey! You? Father was feeling unwell. So I came to teach you. Do you mind? No. Please come. - Take to the left side. - Yes. Signal with your hand. This...? - You teach car very well. - This is not my profession. What do you do? As of now, I'm unemployed. I roam around searching for a job. Anyway... Don't you have a degree? I've a good degree. But it's of no use. - Why? - One also needs money to pay bribes. It's all right. Sound the horn! - You will come tomorrow too? - Yes. - Listen, Murli! - What happened? The girl has called me tomorrow to teach her. - Really? - Yes! But remember this... if her father... what's his name? - Daulatram. - If he sees you... ...in a young get-up, you are in for trouble. Hey! I didn't think of that! You? Yes. I am well now. I hope you don't mind. Not at all. Let's go. Please come. Your son is quite good-looking. But I think he's shy of girls. Nothing of the sort. He's a capable boy. I have got him educated till engineering. Ever since childhood, he doesn't mix with girls. That's a good habit. He has a good nature too. There's something wrong. Looks like there's clogging in the petrol. Stop the car on the side. Why did the car have to breakdown now? What a girl! - There's an old man with her. - Who's scared of an old man? Let's go. What is it? Nothing. It's just that I've become fond of you. What nonsense? - Don't you touch me. - You're a darling! Leave me. What's going on? Can't you see? We're making merry. Sir, she's like your daughter. She must be your daughter. She's my sweetheart. Leave me, I say. The rascal had come to save the girl. Leave me. Why are you troubling the innocent girl? Get lost, you old man! Will you do it again? No? Will you? What is it? Get lost! Hold on. Come here. Do push-ups. - Look over there! - Where? Gosh! "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "What at swagger, what a power, what vigor, what courage he has." "Broken are my misconception, God, old man ha so much vigor." "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "Look, he has steered my heart and made my so devout" "Look, he has steered my heart and made my so devout" "I thought it to be fire cracker but he turned out to be a bomb.." "..vigours than younger stud." "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "Old man is stanger, I find him dear, it's seem I've seen a dram." "Old man is stanger, I find him dear, it's seem I've seen a dram." "I have no shame admitting it." "he is more vigours than younger stud" "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "Appears old but he ain't old, Look in my heart, I'm conviced." "Appears old but he ain't old, Look in my heart, I'm conviced." "Whatever he is he's softhearted.." ".. he is more vigours than younger stud" "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" "What at swagger, what a power, what vigor, what courage he has." "Broken are my misconception, God, old man ha so much vigor." "Old man is no lesser, he is more vigours than younger stud" Vijay, you are here? Where's Daddy? - Here he is. - Hello! So you were both hands-in-glove? No. He's a mechanical engineer. Still, he's unemployed. That's why he's working as a driver with me. Your father said that he needs an aged man as a driver. So I... He's right. My mother works, and I rest at home. I couldn't bear it. So I accepted this assignment. My father has gone out. Come and meet him when he returns. This... - Ah, yes. It will be useful. - You're right! Come on... take it! Enough. - I'm going. - Where are you going? Leave me. - Who's picture are you clicking? - The ocean. - Who's pictures were you clicking? - The ocean. - The ocean? - I'm leaving. Hey, you! Get lost from here. You've interfered again today? I reach every place where wrong is done. Move aside quietly. And hand over the camera to me. I won't return the camera till I don't remove the roll. Don't you touch the roll film! Both, the camera and the roll film belong to me. Just return the camera. I won't return it, till I don't remove the roll film. You got saved from the police the last time. Perhaps not again. - Give me my camera quietly. - I won't. Will you give me the camera or not? Didn't I say I won't? - Get lost. - You get lost! Give me the camera. Here it is. Let's go. Where are you, Behari? You shouldn't talk of death again and again. It's considered very inauspicious in my village. You take a lot of advantage of my helplessness. My 10,000 rupees... - You'll get hurt. - I've already got hurt. You shouldn't talk of the 10,000 rupees again and again? The amount is in the fixed deposit. It'll take 6 years. Daughter, why've you put on the beard? I am here. - Who's he? - He's him. - Him? - He teaches me driving. He's very brave. He saved me from the clutches of rogues. - Rogues attacked you? - Yes. - Take out my gun. - But, papa... That happened 7 days ago, when you had gone out. - You are fine now, aren't you? - Yes. - Thank you. - What happened?! Your old bones are very strong. Do you have a son? Yes. He has a son. Tell him. I have a son. It's a very sad tale. I got him educated a lot. But he couldn't get a job. If you could get him a job, Mr. Daulatram. - What's his name? - Vijay. I see... that Vijay, the one whom I had met that day? Send him to the factory. I'll give him a job. Not there. Here. He's the boy whom we needed for the engineering department. So you've done a diploma in Mechanical Engineering. Any experience? I've just made the beginning. He's a very capable boy. Appoint him for the job. I take his guarantee. All right, Mr. Daulatram. If you take the guarantee, there's no problem. Still, I will have to take Ajay's opinion. Mr. Ajay has gone out. All right. Appoint him on a temporary basis. Come to the factory tomorrow at 10 a.m. Yes, sir. Mother! What's the matter? I've got a job, mother. Yes, mother. It's a very good job. Now promise me that you will leave your job. I will leave the job once you are married. Let me establish myself in my career first. - I've had it! - Father! My father has been killed. What happened? My leg has been broken. I didn't do a thing. I didn't even see him. Call the police! Call the police! - Why complicate matters? - Pay up money. Sir, looks like we will have to pay some money. Hurry up. My leg has been fractured. Take appropriate compensation. Don't worry. I will handle everything. What are you handling? Hey! Where did she come from? Is he your father or mine? What's this going on? Get lost. Or I'll hand you over to the police. It's your daily routine. To pretend accident and demand money. What say? You have faked enough. Get up now. No, dear. This time my leg has truly been broken. I'll be unable to walk. I know everything. I've a liquor bottle for you at home. Go home. Goodbye, sir. We will meet again like this. My clothes got soiled unnecessarily. - Get lost now. - Come on... get lost! - Greetings. - Greetings. "You've come from Agra or Bareli." "I'll go and ask your friend" "Why you've come dressed up with jsamine" "I'll go and ask your friend" "Bangles zinlges from Jaipur" "O girl, from where have you brought this red stola" "Bangles zinlges from Jaipur" "O girl, from where have you brought this red stola" "Have you brought it from Lakhnow or Jhumri Talaiya." "I'll go and ask your friend" "I have fallen for you at first site." "God knows from where you got this attitude" "I have fallen for you at first site." "God knows from where you got this attitude" "Have you brought it from Mumbai, or Delhi" "I'll go and ask your friend" "You've come from Agra or Bareli." "I'll go and ask your friend" I've started loving you. No, Ajay. Love is merely an amusement for a rich person. But for a poor person, love is such a wealth, such a bliss... ...which he desires, but cannot achieve. But why? Just because the person is poor? No, but because the person is helpless. What's the helplessness? Tell me. I want to know. Come with me. She's my sister. Sister! Ramesh, you rascal, scoundrel! What do you want now? You are very keen for a child, weren't you? I've killed the child. He wanted a child. I killed his child. Take her away. I won't spare you. I will kill you. How many times have I told you not to bring along any man... ...to meet your sister? I'm sorry. What's the matter? That's why I don't allow outsiders to come here. Her sister created a scene again today. Auntie, since you weren't available at the office... - Who's he? - He's with me. - Greetings. - Greetings. Come with me. Mr. Suresh, send for two cups of tea. How strange! She looks upon me as a servant. Was Ramesh your sister's husband? He loved my sister very much before marriage. After marriage, he abandoned her and ran away. - Where did he run away? - With some other girl... ...when my sister was pregnant. One day, she pierced her abdomen with a scissor. When she saw the dead infant at the hospital... ...she wept so much that her brain nerves burst open. Ever since, she has been living here. A person whose father is a drunkard... ...whose mother is an asthma patient, and whose sister is insane... ...you can very well imagine how many responsibilities the girl has. She's a very courageous and self-respecting girl. This is a charitable institute. But Asha pays for her sister's expenses herself. Since when do you know her? Since a few days. She participates in programs, sings and dances at functions... ...and earns money for her family's livelihood. But society doesn't allow her to lead a respectable life. Does a lonely girl have no right to lead a respectable life? She does have the right. Why not? Mr. Verma wants to meet you. Mr. Verma, we want you to speak to Ms Nirmaladevi in this regard. Nirmaladevi, I hear girls disappear from the institute during the nights. What're you saying? We ourselves don't believe it. But there's no smoke without fire. Everybody, be it you, we, or the organization stands to lose face. But who told you all this? It's not important who told us this. But we have heard about this earlier too. How is this possible? If I don't budge even an inch while on duty... ...during the nights, how can the girls... - This is a direct accusation on me. - We are only alerting you. Greetings. Let's go. Why are the machines shut down? A spare part of the bigger machine is out-of-order. - So? - We'll have to import... ...the spare-part. It might take 8 to 10 days. We'd lose millions of rupees in 8 to 10 days. If you permit me, shall I try to correct the problem? He's a new boy. How can he repair the machine? What's the harm in trying him? You may look into the fault. You've been amazing. Your skills are indeed commendable. With your grace. He made a spare part instantly and fit it into the machine... ...and he became a hero overnight. Instead, if I had imported a spare part from outside... ...I would've got a commission of at least 10,000 rupees. - Everything has gone wrong. - What wrong have I done? - Shut up. Stop chasing me. - How can I stop chasing you? After all, you've my 10,000 rupees. - I'm very disturbed. - Me too. - Get back to your work. - I can't. Here... take this 100 rupees and get lost from here. - This is 100 rupees? - Yes. I see. Keep it yourself. What happened, papa? Who's that person on the other side of the window? This is a mirror, and you are seeing yourself. It's my fault. I shouldn't have got him the job. Not given a job to whom? - He cheats those who benefit him. - Who are you talking of? - Vijay. He repaired the machine. - Is that so? I knew he is brilliant. The phone. I'm Santosh speaking. You? Yes, tell me? Can you come to my home for a while? - I will come right away. - Please come soon. - Welcome, Mr Daulatram. - Greetings, Mr. Santosh. He's over there. Please come. You said over the phone that there's something of my interest. Yes, of course. Hold my hand. Please come. He's Mr. Vachchani. Please be seated. Not there. Sit on it. He's Mr. Vachchani, and that's liquor. - I don't drink liquor. - Why? - Because it's so expensive. - It's free of cost for you. Then I'll drink. - Make a peg for him. - Is there somebody there? - Why? Can't you make it? - I'm a lawyer. How can I make a peg? Shame on such a profession! Make a small peg for me. Here's your small peg. - A big one for you. - In return for this...? You will have to give advice in return. I give advice without asking. In fact, I call out to people to come and take advice. - Shall I drink it? - Drink it. Slowly... slowly. It's Scotch, after all. What about the thing that would benefit me? You're the General Manager of Mr. Vishwanath's factory? - What is it about my benefit? - What if you become a factory-owner? How can I become a factory-owner? I've started a cold drink factory in competition to Vishwanath. You will do the task of diverting Vishwanath's customers to me. I've a personal relationship with them. There's nothing personal in business. - Can I come in, sir? - Who are you? Mr. Suresh has sent me from the charitable institution. - Mr. Suresh has sent you? - Yes. Tell that idiot that I am not fond of this. Sir, this is what you're fond of. Yes! Being fond of this is much more expensive than drinking whiskey! Are you interested? - I'm talking to you. - I? No, no. Mr. Vachchani, make arrangements for her. Come on... let's go. What do you think of yourself, Vishwanath? What do you think of yourself, Vishwanath? I'm not Vishwanath. You abuse me. You think that I'm blind, do you? Fool! I'm not Vishwanath. I too want to settle scores with him. - You are embracing Vishwanath? - To strangle him to death. - I want to settle a score with him. - I too want to settle a score. I want to break your teeth. I will break it... like this! You? What are you doing here? I'm working. I'm the Assistant Engineer here. - Who appointed you here? - The boss of this place. Have you appointed a new Assistant Engineer, Daddy? - Yes. - You should've at least told me. You weren't around then. He's very qualified. It's not a question of qualification. That boy won't work here. Dismiss him right away. One shouldn't take decisions in a hurry. Do you know? He saved our factory from being shut down. A spare part had become defective. If we were to import it, it would have taken at least 10 days. Vijay made that spare-part himself and started the machine. You mean you... Gosh! Help! What happened to him? He is seriously injured. Let's take him to the hospital. Lift him quickly. According to the Industrial Act... ...we will pay him whatever compensation is applicable. This is not an ordinary accident. Raghu has lost his eyesight. Did he lose his eyes because of us? I have decided to contribute 20,000 rupees towards this. 20,000 rupees? How wonderful! You know well that Raghu won't be able to work all his life. For how many days will his family be able to survive with 20,000? Mind your own business. Understand? This is a matter between the management and the labor union. We can dismiss you whenever we want. What say, Mr. Ajay? I am not worried about my job. But I won't keep quiet if you deprive a worker of what he deserves. You will have to deposit a sum of 100,000 rupees in Raghu's name... ...in the bank, so that he gets a monthly interest of 1,000 rupees. You are instigating the workers against the management. Otherwise I will send for the police. Please go and do your work. The factory shouldn't suffer any losses. What's going on at the factory? The worker who lost his eyesight... ...there's a quarrel regarding his compensation. What's there to quarrel about? We'll have to pay the compensation. But how much? That Assistant Engineer is demanding 100,000 rupees. He wants to become a leader of the workers. We won't let him become a leader. So Mr. Ajay dismissed him... ...and the workers went on strike. The factory has been shut down. We stand to lose a lot of money like this. We should compromise. What compromise can there be? Raghu has lost both his eyes. If you wish... ...I can give him both my eyes. As it is, I can't see anything. Would you please shut up? Ajay dear, a clever businessman is one who understands the situation. First of all, we will have re-appoint Ajay. What're you saying, Daddy? It will be my insult. - It is I who will be insulted. - But, Daddy, you...? Mr. Daulatram, send somebody to call Vijay. Mr. Vijay, boss has called you upstairs. - Greetings. - Come, Vijay. We too sympathize with Vijay as much as you do. So, as a humanitarian step... ...we've deposited 100,000 rupees in the bank in Raghu's name. - Get down to work now. - Yes. You are spoiling them, Daddy. Keep quiet. Nothing has happened to me. Come on, go away. I hope you aren't hurt. You are fine, aren't you? - Come, I will drop you home. - No, thank you. Come... sit. - You saved me once again. - In fact, you've saved me this time. If you'd applied the brakes a little late, I would've been dead. You don't appear to be in a good mood today. Have you quarreled with anybody? No, nothing of the sort. By the way, where are you going? To meet the doctor. My sister at the charitable institution... ...is undergoing some tests. A renowned specialist from Germany is here. He has treated several mental cases. He charges a lot of fees. Let's see. What is to be seen? Please stop here. This is a noble deed. Why don't you do it yourself? She is a very self-respecting girl. If she knows that I'm helping her, she will never accept it. Yes, father? - They've come from I & T. - From the I & T? I want to organize your show. Everybody knows you. Your shows are popular everywhere. And it is my good fortune that you've approached me on your own. Take out the documents. This is a 3-year contract. Please sign here. Here's an advance of 5,000 rupees. I'll inform you about the show details later. Would you like a soft drink or something? No, thank you. I'm in a hurry today. I should be leaving. - Greetings. - Greetings. You're leaving? Nirmala Auntie! - How are you, Asha? - I'm fine. I'm very happy. I've bagged a very big contract today. Is it? That's good news. - Now sister can be treated properly. - Yes. What're you doing here? I wanted to buy some saris for mother. All right, then. How are you? I didn't know that you live in this city. What would you have done even if you had known? Well... you see... Have you come here to buy something? Yes. I'm buying something for my son. How many children do you have? I've only one son. And he means everything to me. And what about your husband? Husband?! What does he do? I don't know what he does. I haven't met him since ages. Why? He doesn't support you? No. In greed for a wealthy father-in-law's wealth... ...he married his daughter and abandoned me. But you didn't remarry... Men change their wives. But a woman... once she accepts somebody as her husband... ...she doesn't choose another person as a husband. Let's go. I'm ready. - What're you thinking? - You go ahead. I'll come later. You should accompany me to the marriage. Let's go. Let's go home. What happened, Daddy? You don't seem well. You had better take rest. Go and summon the doctor. Hurry up. You need rest desperately. I'll fetch your medicine. Nothing is wrong with me. I'm absolutely fine. Tell me something. How much do you love me? Ever since I remember, I've got only your love. You mean everything to me. Then tell me... if your Daddy were to make a mistake... ...would you be able to forgive me? What're you saying, Daddy? You? A mistake? Remember, son... never make anybody curse you. A curse is very bad. It makes a person suffer all his life. I've seen both, heaven and hell, right here on earth. If you two children weren't with me... ...it would've been difficult for me to survive in this world. Whose picture are you looking at, Mother? Mr. Kashyap's picture? You know him? Yes. I work in his factory. He's my boss. But how come you have his picture? Mother... I've always seen you applying vermilion in your hair-parting. But I never saw my Daddy. I tried to question you several times. But you always became disturbed with this query. So I never posed this question to you. But you will have to tell me today. Tell me, mother. Did your husband leave you because of him? Am I the outcome of your sins? Am I your illicit son? I have lost respect for myself today. You're an immoral... You want to know who he is, don't you? He's your father. Yes, dear. Your brother had been born out of that woman's womb. Both mother and son are alive even today. Thereafter, I tried to attempt suicide. But my maternal affection prevented my death. Then I went to a temple and filled my hair-parting with vermilion... ...so that society doesn't look upon you as an illicit son. I didn't tell you all this because... ...mother doesn't want to narrate the story of her sacrifice. But the hatred that you've developed for a mother... ...to eliminate that hatred, I'd to tell you all this. Now, you may look upon me as you wish. Don't say so, mother. You're more noble than even the Kunti... ...who abandoned her son Karna in the river fearing society. You always kept me close to your heart... ...and I suspected a noble woman like you. Forgive me, mother. Dear... if possible, transfer half of our property in their name. I know that I don't have the right to say this. But if you can do such a thing, my soul will be at peace. I take a pledge in your name... ...that I will find my brother and my mother somehow... ...and name half of the property in their name. I promise you, Daddy. Where are you going? To teach a lesson to the person who made you suffer so much. There's no place for you here now. You cannot dismiss me. I'm resigning on my own. Tell me something. What's the benefit of leaving the job? Benefit? How can I work in a company of someone who made you suffer? The person whom you hate is no longer alive. But his son is there. Ajay has immense wealth. I will eliminate everything. No. You won't do such a thing. Everybody has to suffer the consequences for his actions. - Leave everything to God. - God? What God? One has to even sound the temple bells to awaken Him. Don't you dare say such a thing. Go and meet him. I won't rest in peace till I destroy Ajay's wealth. How dare you indulge in hooliganism! Lock him up! Be seated. - What's the matter? - I want to file a report. - I am searching for someone. - Searching for whom? - For Ms Nirmaladevi. - Tell me your address. - How is Nirmaladevi related to you? - She's like my mother. Did she live with you? - No. - Any address? - I don't even know her address. - Any photograph? - Since when is she missing? - Around 22 years ago. 22 years ago? Are you in your right senses? You don't have her address, nor her picture, nor her identity. I've recorded your report. Go to the TV centre. Release an advertisement. Only those people can be of help to you. No photograph? What's the use of releasing the advertisement? Just publish her name and my address. Perhaps there might be an outcome. As you wish. Deposit the charges. The matter will be published. What're you doing here? Have you bought the street too? - It's no use arguing with you. - Then don't argue. - What're you doing here? - Nothing. - Come with me. - Where? For a ride. Come on! "You play the music" "I will sing to it." "The atmosphere asks for it. The atmosphere asks for it."

"You play the music" "You play the music" - Where's your father? - This is a cupboard. - Where's your father? - Why don't you speak to him? I don't want to speak to him. - Didn't I ensure a job for him? - Yes, you did. Then why didn't he have mercy on me? Why loot my home? I won't spare you. Who is he? Why is he screaming? I see. So you have changed your voice too?! - Who are you? - Who are you?! She's my mother. Where has the mother come from? That old man said there's no mother. - That he just has a son! - An old man? Which old man? You wouldn't consider him to be an old man. After all, you remarried. - Speak decently. - What nonsense is this? - Nothing. This is only an act. - An act? I mean... he's the father, and he's the son too. What do you mean? I needed a driver to teach your daughter driving. So I made him an old man. You mean you tried to cheat me? I'll report the matter to the police. Don't ever dare to dance or sing a song with my daughter. If I can't see a thing, it doesn't mean that I cannot see anything. - There he goes! - What's all this? - It hurts, mother. - Nothing. It's all profit only. What's the profit? His daughter loves him. You will get a daughter-in-law very soon. Don't do anything by hurting the parents. If the marriage is to take place, it should be with the parents' consent. Then the marriage won't happen. What happened, papa? You learn driving with the father, and romance with his son? - The thing is... I love Vijay. - Shut up! You love him. You want to marry him. Papa! Actually... Yes, I know that you are not afraid of being in love. - But you'll have to fear me. - Where are you taking me? You won't come out of the house, till I allow you. - Move away. Shut the door. - What're you doing? If you want your 10,000 rupees... ...make sure that this girl doesn't come out of the room. Both the doctors are with him. Doctor, I suppose my sister will recover. The doctor says that there's nothing to worry about. Your sister will recover completely. Excuse me... this is Mr. Ajay's car, isn't it? Yes. Please come, doctor. Asha? How come you are here? Forgive me, Ajay. Hey! What're you doing, Asha? I misunderstood you. You got me a contract... ...without even informing me. My sister's treatment... Don't think that I've done you any favour. I've only allowed your talent to develop. And every human being should respect talent. The doctor was saying that your sister will be fine soon. I can never forget your favour. If your heart agrees to it, consider it my love for you. "Hold on sweeheart, don't yearn my heart" "Hold on sweeheart, don't yearn my heart" "You've just come don't even talk of going." "Let me go, my love, what excuse would I make?"

"Let me go, my love, what excuse would I make?" "The day is gone it's evening I have to be at home" "Hold on sweeheart" Mr. Suresh! The thing is... she is used to walking in sleep. She was going out. I awakened her and was bringing her back. So she is used to walking in her sleep? Go in, will you? Mr. Suresh... l've known only today that... ...all that Mr. Verma said about the girls disappearing for the nights. I will complain about you to Mr. Verma. No. I don't want to become the cause of infamy. Have mercy on my children. Just give me one chance. I won't give you a reason to complain again. If I lose my job, my children will starve to death. I beg of you. Just one chance. All right. I will spare you this time. But if it happens again... ...then I'll be forced to report about you. I'd made the donation to the institution on your say-so. And you had promised to give me interest on a regular basis. You are absolutely right. But the senior sister there... She might be a sister for you. For me, she is only a woman. I want a woman for those three wolves. The door to their kitchen shouldn't be closed. - What's the name of your sister? - She's not my sister. By the way, her name is Nirmaladevi. Greetings. I could've never thought about you in such a light. We had so much respect for you. But... What have I done? What's the matter? - Ask your assistant about that. - I tried to explain to her. But... What do you mean to say? You send the girls of the institution out for prostitution. I see! So you've played this trick! Rascal! I pardoned you that day. And this is how... Stop! Can you tell me where the girl named Mona is... ...who had been admitted to Ward A two days ago? - I don't know. - But I do know. Suresh followed her, and he caught her and brought her with him. Come here, Mona. Mona, how did you go out of the ashram? With madam. She had taken me along. With me? I took you outside? Yes, she dropped me at the Golden Club... ...and collected 500 rupees from there and went away. No! This is a lie! It's a conspiracy against me. It's all wrong. I don't know a thing. Go inside, Mona. Nirmaladevi, there's no place for you in this institution. You will be given the dismissal letter tomorrow. Do you walk with closed eyes? It's you, Auntie? You? Here? Like this? Tears in your eyes? Tell me... what's the matter? Why are there tears in your eyes? Come with me. - No, Ajay. I don't know. - Tell me... how did you come here? Who brought you to this institution? - I don't know. - Answer me truthfully. - This Suresh brought me here. - She's lying. I didn't do a thing. He paid me money and forced me to speak against the sister. No, no. I didn't do a thing. She's lying. This detestable thing has been done by him. A few days ago, when sister wanted to complain about him... ...when she learnt about girls disappearing all night long... ...this rascal pleaded to the sister... ...and let him go. But this rascal didn't mend his ways. He deserves to be in the police lock-up, not in this institution. - Take him away from here. - No, please let me go. You too come along. Please forgive me. I insulted a noble lady like you. Your being upset with me is valid. But don't leave this institution. Everybody at this institution needs you. Thank you very much. Dear... you've done me a big favour today. How can you say this? Can a son do a favour to his mother? Your parents must have done many pious deeds... ...that they got a son like you. Who are your fortunate parents? My Daddy's name is Vishwanath Kashyap. What're you thinking, Auntie? Nothing. - I should be leaving now. - All right, then. If I can be of any help to you, I will be very happy. All right, then. After the father's death, the son is continuing with the enmity. Shall I file a case against the women's institution? The case will begin only now. - Mr. Daulatram. - Here I am. You were mentioning about Vijay who had been dismissed by Ajay. - Vijay is a very good boy. - Bring him to me. He romances with my daughter. There's nothing personal in a business. Why've you come here, Mr. Daulatram? I felt like seeing you. I remembered you. Nice that you didn't go there. - What're you talking about? - I've come to get you a job. I don't want to work in that cold-drink factory. I know that you are still angry at me. But what can I do? I'm a girl's father. And with my daughter... I know that you're a self-respecting boy. So I want to make you a bigger person than Ajay. How will that be? Compete with him. I've confirmed your job at Mr. Santosh's cold-drink factory. - Would you like to join? - I will. I surely will. Here he is, Mr. Santosh. He's Mr. Vijay. You may talk now. Mr. Daulatram... Not there. That way. I hear that you resigned from Mr. Vishwanath's factory. - Yes. - Why? He paid less money? - He was a miser. - He was a blood-sucker. I'll see to it that I eliminate his family and his factory. Anyway, this is my personal matter. I see... you've a personal matter too. I too have a personal matter. I've a cold drink factory. I want you to work as a mechanical engineer with me. My factory should make greater progress than Vishwanath's factory. It will be done. How will that be? It is believed that if the other person's house is higher than ours... ...and there's no chance to raise our own house... ...then one should demolish the other person's house. Our house will become higher automatically. You're truly amazing, Vijay. Both of us have the same intentions. Let's join hands. And let's start our enemy's ruin from today itself. Let me speak. One more truck has been burnt down, Mr. Ajay. What? This cannot be. Did you inform the police? I've sent for the fire-brigade. What's the matter, dear? I don't know what's happening. Two trucks vanished a few days ago. Another truck was set on fire day-before-yesterday. And today, one of our trucks was blown away with a bomb. I don't understand which enemy is hell bent upon destroying us. All this started happening after your father's death. Moreover, I see that you are always lost these days. Surely somebody is taking advantage of this. Currently, all my attention is focussed on fulfilling... ...my promise to Daddy. I'm searching for somebody. How wonderful, Vijay. You shook the very foundation of our enemy. Here... - No, thank you. I don't drink. - You don't drink? You should drink. It's a joyous day for us today. Open the door, papa! What should I do? How should I meet Vijay? "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, it's so cold now" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "The breeze of chilled air are chilling my body" "I'll always have you in my arms." "My entire body is suddenly feeling warm" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Don't look me in such a way, I may lose myself" "What can I do, if someone herself becomes a prey" "I've learnt to live, as I have found your love" "You came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, it's so cold now" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "My love, I was scared and I came in your blanket" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, it's so cold now" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" "Hey, you came to me in my blanket now I am so relieved" How could this happen? The trucks are disappearing gradually. The factory too is running into losses. How will I be able to fulfill my promise to Daddy? We want our money back! Just a minute! I know that the promissory notes to all of you have already matured. But I need a time of 3 months to return your money. I'm prepared to pay you interest for the three months. We want the interest as well as the principal amount too. Otherwise we will get even your home auctioned! Let's go. You? I wonder how I got pulled to this place. But who are you? I am only a small fry. But for a sinking person, even a small fry can mean a lot. I don't understand. Who can understand the wonders of fate? Your Daddy made this bungalow, the factory after hard work... ...and you too are trying your best to save it. I have come to help you. Reason? Perhaps something to do with our past birth. Tell me... how much should I give? I am asking the price of your factory. Tell me. Who told you that I'm selling the factory? As it is, the factory is bound to be sold. You've to repay debts running into millions of rupees. How will you repay the sum? Moreover, I'm making you a lump sum payment. You are surely mistaken. I have no such intentions. Mr. Ajay, intentions can change. And an intelligent person is one who changes his intentions with time. Or else... Or else, what? Otherwise it doesn't take long for a king to turn a pauper. What would you want to get out of here? Why turn away the good fortune that's knocking at your door? Moreover, I don't find the atmosphere of this home too peaceful. I can hear the sounds of owls from now itself. Your life is likely to be disrupted. What will you take to get out of here? - I'm your sympathizer. - I don't want your sympathy. All right. When you start seeing sense in a couple of days... ...you may remember me before putting the factory and the home up for sale. Here's my card. You'll stand to gain. Somebody has cut off the water connection to the factory. - What're you saying? - It's true. - It cannot be. - All work has come to a standstill. Do you know who is causing us all this loss? - Who? - Vijay. Ever since you dismissed him, he has become your enemy. - Where does he live? - In Parel. Behind the cloth mill. You should drive carefully. If you meet with an accident, you will be in trouble. I wanted to kill you in an accident. But... But it didn't happen. Because I was in my senses. I wasn't intoxicated with wealth, like you are. A traitor like you cannot be fortunate to be wealthy. Because you cheat the very person whom you are dependent on. Mind your language, rascal. If I hit you once, all your teeth will fall out in a jiffy. Did you hear? This rascal will make my teeth fall out! Auntie... you? Move away, mother. You don't know who he is. He's very egoistic about being wealthy. Didn't I ask you to stop? Vijay is her son? - Stop, I say. - No, mother. I will make him suffer so much that despite having all... ...the pleasures, he won't be able to rest in peace. This scoundrel... You shameless creature! Is this how you respect your mother? Have I taught you to destroy other people's homes? Go away from here. I ask you for pardon on behalf of my son. No, don't ask pardon for his sake. He doesn't deserve it. I can't even believe that he's a son of a noble mother like you. Do you know? He used to work in my factory. And today, he's hell bent on ruining that factory. He's destroyed my business. If you hadn't come today, I would've done something to him. He's ignorant. He doesn't even know how much I'm obliged to you. I promise you that henceforth he will never do a thing... ...which would cause you any losses. I have as much respect for you as a person has for his mother. Bless you, son. He's dead. - Tell me! Who has sent you? - Mr. Ajay sent us. Mr. Ajay! What's the matter, Ajay? Whenever I ask you for money, you say you are helpless. What's your problem? Listen... if you want to hear. My helplessness is that whatever wealth and property we have... ...somebody else has a right over it too. What're you saying? Somebody else's right over our property? Yes, mother. My brother and a mother. I promised Daddy when he was dying that I would find them... ...and hand over half the share to them. Only then will I be able to fulfill my promise. Which mother and brother are you talking about? Mother, to marry you, Daddy had to cheat a woman. Just a few days before dying, he learnt that... ...that woman is living, and she has a son too. At that point of time, Daddy willed all his wealth and property to me. My step-mother and brother have suffered all their life. By naming half the property in their names... ...Daddy's soul will be at peace. If I can do that, I will consider that... ...l've fulfilled my responsibility towards my father. But how is all this possible? If our creditors bring attachments to our property... ...I will sell all my property and repay their debts. But this house and the factory... which are my father's reminders... ...l've named both these properties in my brother's name. And I won't rest in peace till I find them. What was I about to do? How could I fall down to such an extent... ...that I wanted to kill my own brother? I was on my way to destroy him? I was destroying a person who named half his property in my name? I would never let such a thing happen. I've given him so much suffering. I will get back all his happiness. I want to see him happy. All our missing trucks are back. - What? - Yes. Look there. It's you, Asha? The factory has resumed full operations again. The four trucks that were missing have come back. Really?! Mr. Daulatram was saying that Vijay did all the mischief. I think Vijay's mother must have made him see reason. Who? Nirmala Auntie? What? What did you say? Nirmala Auntie who? The one whom you met at the women's institution. - What's her full name? - I don't know her full name. - Vijay is her only son, wasn't he? - Yes. Come with me. Come, Ajay dear. I see a ray of hope after many days. If you don't mind, I want to know your full name. Is Mr. Vishwanath Kashyap the father of Vijay? Speak up, Auntie. Please speak up, Auntie. Yes. I feel so relieved. Allow me some space in your feet. Make me your Vijay. I'm also your son. I searched for you everywhere. Daddy had told me everything about you. He was very embarrassed. Please pardon me. Pardon me too. Unknowingly, I behaved very badly with my brother. I want to ask Vijay for pardon. Where is he, mother? Bring one of that. Where's the light? Drinking liquor in the dark has its own charm. Here it is, sir! - Drink heartily. - Yes, boss. People get paid for committing murders. And we got paid to pretend a murder. What are you up to? Tell me... who sent you to put on this act? Tell me! If you don't tell me truthfully, I won't pretend anything. I will burn you in reality. Santosh sent us. He had asked us to take Ajay's name. Rascal! Where are you, rascal? - Who are you? - Get lost! For trespassing in another person's home... ...I will charge you under Sections... Why're you looking like this? Why did this man get shocked at the mention of Bhogilal's name? - Perhaps his name might be Bhogilal. - No. His name is Santosh. Rascal! Looks like she has recognized me. Now I've to kill two birds with one stone... Lalita and Vijay. Driver... let's go to the police station. Sit quietly. Move it, driver! Speak loudly, Mr. Santosh. I can't hear a thing. Reach the place behind the cold drink factory at nine tonight. We will also reach there. At 9 o'clock sharp. I've run away from home. Papa had locked me in a room. I got to know from Murli that you are here. But why did you have to come here? Stop the car! - Come on... out! - Who are you? That's Ajay's mother. Who are these men? What do you want? I think there's something fishy. Wait here. I will be back. - What's going on? - Get lost from here. How come you are here? Who are these people? Who are you, dear? Leave me. Madam... madam... Madam... madam! Those two people have killed her. - Shut up! - I didn't commit the murder. - Then what's this? Take him away. - I haven't committed the murder. Let's take her to the hospital. Where are you taking me? Come on... Leave my daughter. Otherwise, I'll complain to Mr. Santosh. Your daughter is meant for our three wolves. But she's my own daughter! In our business, there're no sons or daughters. Only girls. Rascal! Leave my daughter! Leave my daughter! Take her away. Where has this person come from? Leave me. Who are you? - Shut up! - Leave me. - What happened? - She didn't die. Only wounded. The police has taken her to the hospital. Fool! What if she speaks up to the police? Who are you? - I am her son. - All right. Mother... I haven't committed the murder. I know that my son cannot commit a murder. But Ajay needs you desperately. Take this. Chant Lord Rama's name. Perhaps there might be some way out. There's a phone call for you. I am Ajay. Son... Yes. Son, he will kill me. Who will kill you? Bhogilal will kill me. Who's Bhogilal? Santosh is none other than Bhogilal. Yes. He's Bhogilal. The one who murdered your grandfather. He had escaped from jail ten years ago. Take rest, mummy. You will be fine, mummy. I... l... No, mother. Come to your senses, mummy. Doctor, save my mummy. She's become unconscious again. Please save her. Have courage. Please sit outside for a while. I will examine her. Doctor, what are you doing? What happened? Beware! If you move, I will pump you with bullets! Understand! My daughter! Embrace me later. Open the ropes first. I just forgot that! What has he pointed at your neck? It's a sickle. Remove it from here. Here, take 10 rupees. Leave my daughter. - You did that?! - Yes, I did that! Now we can pull down a bridge, or even a Qutub Minar! Who is it? Just a minute. Here... 500 rupees. Leave my daughter now. This is not 500 rupees. It's only 2 rupees. Did you see what I did to that man? - Shall I hit you? - Go ahead. Leave me. No! No! Beat the rascal! Rascal! I won't spare you today! Goodbye! I'm entrusting them to you now! What happened? Ajay, remove his mask. There's a diamond in his teeth. We will cut the glass with it. Hurry up. Bang him! Harder, Ajay! The diamond should brush against the glass. Lift the barrier! Just have a look! Can't you hear? Lift the barrier! You rascal! Lift the barrier! We are in a hurry! Come on... lift it. Come out. Quick! Stop! Look over there! Bring them in front of their mother. You old woman! Will you die of receiving shocks? You go ahead. I will eliminate all of them. Otherwise I will eliminate you. Let's take all of them away. You were amazing, Papa! My car is the genius. Did you see how wonderful the car has been? Here we are! Where are you? Where are you? How dare you misbehave with my daughter! - Vijay, my dear! - He's not Vijay! - Vijay, my dear! - He isn't Vijay. Vijay, my dear... You too aren't Vijay? - Is he Vijay or not? - He's a scoundrel! Get up, Bhogilal! You tried to kill my mother! Arrest him, Inspector. Let's go forward and beat him even more. It's of no use. The police has already arrested him. - It means his role is over? - Yes. You had cheated and escaped from the police. Move! Mother... mother! Open your eyes, mother. Santosh... the one who's Bhogilal... He's been punished for his misdeeds. And she's the mother. And he's her son, Vijay. I had been searching for them since a long time. I found them today! My responsibility has been completed today. Forgive me. I have unknowingly troubled you a lot. No! If I had known that Ajay's Daddy and you... How are you to blame? Everybody gets whatever one is destined for. My dear... Now you have two sons. I... Mother! No, mother!
