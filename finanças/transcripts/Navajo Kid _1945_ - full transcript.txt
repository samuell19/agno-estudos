[ Laughs ] White bear wrestle better than navajo. Don't forget, you and gray wolf taught me all I know. That's right. You more navajo than navajo. Me navajo. [ Laughs ] That looks like gray wolf. White bear, come quick to the agency. What's the matter, gray wolf? They no tell me. Tell me tell you come quick. There was nothing I could do, Tom. What happened? Robbery. Cleaned the safe. Cold-blooded murder. They even took his ring and his watch. Tom, I've got to tell you something. Don't quite know how to break this to you, but, uh, kirk was not your father. What? What do you mean? When you were a baby, your real folks were wiped out by apaches. Friendly navajos found you and brought you up until you were about five. Then kirk became Indian agent. Took you in and raised you as his own son. Been meaning to tell you this for a long time. Always told me he dreaded the day he'd have to. When the navajos found you, this was in your basket. That's all there is that connects up with your past. Probably your mother, Tom. Tom. Tom kirk. That's not even my real name. But kirk's a mighty fine handle, unless you can find a better one. What do you aim to do? Find out who killed the only father I've ever known. Gray wolf, saddle up for me. [ Speaks navajo ] Good navajo never forget. Good navajo find men that kill. Men? What did you see? Maybe two, maybe three. Three navajo better than one navajo. We go with you. Not this time, blackhawk. This is a job I do alone. If this is a holdup, mister, we're carrying nothing but passengers. Well, you're takin' on another one. [ Whistles ] Go! Got the time, mister? Much obliged. Heading for canyon city? Uh-huh. Doing business there? Maybe. You must have walked quite a ways, son. What happened to your horse? He went lame. I left him at a ranch. When a man walks in this country, he must be mighty anxious to get someplace, eh? I am. I'm lookin' for someone. Oh. Got the time, mister? Much obliged. What are you doin' up there? Hopalong, if you could jump in a straight line like you jump straight up, you'd win the El dorado sweepstakes. Yes, sir, that's what you'd do. He sure is a jumper. What do you feed him? Mexican jumping beans. Ha ha ha! Oh, I got to get back to the telegraph ticker. Yes, sir, he's the jumpingest jumping frog a man ever got ahold of. Why, he can make this whole counter in one leap. Come on, hopalong, now show them what you can do. Go on, now. Jump. Are you loco,crandall? We don't want any gunplay in here. You darn fool, what are you trying to do, make frog soup out of yourself? You stay right here at your own end of the counter, and don't you even wiggle. Give US a hunk of pie. I got peach, apple, pumpkin, strumberry, lemon meringue, chocolate meringue, Berry huckle-- huckleberry.i didn't make any today. I got some apple. Strawberry.they're out of season. I got some apple. All right, make it apple. Just like in the blue moon saloon. They put the bottle on the bar and you help yourself. Say, I'm gonna let you gents in on something. Now, if you've got enough money, you can clean up here in canyon city, 'cause my frog here hopalong can jump farther than any frog they got around here. Of course, I gotta put him through more training. Are you interested? Son, you'd better come with me. Who are you, telling me what to do? I'm Roy Landon, sheriff of canyon city. Well, what do you want with me? I'd like to have a little friendly chat with you, if you want it friendly-like. My office is just a piece up the street. Take care of that saddle for me, will you, please? I'll pick it up later. [ Laughing ] Hello, murdock. Well, honest John grogan. Where have you been? John!i thought the boys had cleaned you out for keeps. Did you ever see the day I couldn't come back with a new bankroll? The game's open, boys. No limit. All right, name your game, boys. What'll it be? Hey, folks, I've got the red-hot news you've all been waiting for right off the telegraph ticker. Grover Cleveland has been elected president of the United States. [ Cheering ] That was a foregone conclusion. I voted for him. Yeah? How many times, grogan? Once, murdock. Only once. And I don't deal from the bottom of the deck. No, sir. Honest John grogan-- that's what they call him. Yes, sirree. By the way, did you hear? The Indian agent in rock Springs was killed and robbed. The killers got away with 20-30,000. Government money, too. Government money?Yes, sirree. Well, roll me out one seeing as I'm here. Give him a little whiskey. All right, now, what's your name? If it means anything to you, where I come from they call me the navajo kid. Navajo kid, eh? Nope. I can't find you in here. Did you expect to, sheriff? You never can tell. This little book lists the names and descriptions of killers, gunfighters, horse thieves and such-- outlaws wanted in Texas and not wanted here in canyon city. All right, now, navajo, let's have it--your real name. Kirk. Tom kirk. Kirk? You mean Joe kirk's son? You were raised with the navajos. That's right. And here I was looking for you in the outlaw book. So many strangers in town lately, it keeps me hopping to check them all. Say, you said you were looking for somebody. Why? For a good reason, sheriff-- my father was murdered and robbed. I had a hunch you were trailing somebody. You're right, I am. Now you listen to me, Tom kirk. I know you feel pretty bad about what happened. So do I. But let me warn you, don't take the law in your own hands. Maybe I won't have to, with a little help from you. That killing took place in Indian territory. That was a job for a United States marshal. You should have sent for one. And let a hot trail get cold? How hot?Red-hot. Now look here. I represent the law in canyon city. You step out of line, and you'll wind up in a cell. From there, you may end up on a rope. Do I make myself clear? Clear enough. You understand the white man's law, sheriff, but do you know the law of the navajos? Hey, what's the idea of ruining those shells? I'm gonna make a chump out of that jumping frog. I'm gonna feed him these buckshot, and he'll be so heavy, he won't be able to jump over his own shadow. Hey there, what do we owe you? Oh, just a minute. Now, let's see. What's the idea? I sell my pies by the inch. I charge what the tape measure says. Mm-hmm. Now let's see. Coffee and soup is 15. 15...30...45. And yours was... Seventy. Yours was-- let's see... [ Chuckling ] Yeah, now I got it. $2.80. $2.80. Keep the change, pardner. Thanks. Oh, fellas, don't forget to put your money on my jumping frog. He's a humdinger. I'll bet he is. [ Laughing ] Go. [ Croaking ] Why, hopalong, what's the matter? Don't you feel well? [ Croaking ] Are you sick? [ Croaks ] [ Player piano playing ] I'm sorry, boys. Well, Matt crandall. Back for another cleaning, are you? At cards, yeah. Lee hedges and Bo talley-- pals of mine. Howdy, boys. Give me a stack of blues. All right. Green money gets blue chips. Don't worry. We got it. I'll take a stack of those blues myself. Give me a couple of reds. You're just a tinhorn, grogan. It'll take more than you've got to bank this game. Maybe you're right, crandall. Pardon me. I dropped a card. Well, the ace of spades. There it is-- my hole card. New deal, grogan. Just as you say, crandall. Oh, by the way, did you boys hear that the Indian agent over at rock Springs was murdered and robbed? Yeah? No, we didn't hear nothing about it. Got the time, mister? Nighttime, I reckon. Dark outside, ain't it? I ain't got no watch. Once the sun goes down, I have to wait till sun comes up before I find out what time it is. What'll it be, mister? Pie and coffee. Help yourself. I don't know what's wrong with hopalong. He never acted this way before. You don't think he's gonna die, do you? Well, I wouldn't know. No wonder he's sick if that's what you feed him. Lead poisoning usually is fatal, even to a bullfrog. But I never-- oh, now I know. That fella that was sitting right there. Say, if you see a stranger that's got a face that looks like hopalong, he's a no-good cheat. You know, I-I bet he was trying to frame the jumping sweepstakes. How about some coffee? Oh, yeah, sure. You know where a man can buy a good horse? You're looking at a man that owns one. You want to sell him? Well, maybe, all things being equal. What's he like? Mister, he's beautiful. His coat is as sleek and as shiny and as nice and as sweet as a chocolate pie. And his tail and mane are lemon meringue. And his eyes are like blueberry tarts. And just as gentle as a lamb, except when I try to ride him. If he's all you say his is, you've made a deal. Good. Quitting so soon, crandall? Don't tell me you're broke already. Look, grogan, you ain't even dented our roll. We'll be back. Right now I'm thirsty. Talley and me will look after the horses. What'll it be, stranger? Make it anything. How about a little bourbon? The first one's on the house. Much obliged. You got the time, mister? I don't go in for timepieces. Uh, here's the time. Thanks. Where'd you get that ring? That, my friend, is none of your business. I asked you a question. Where'd you get that ring? Say, what is this? I'm doing things your way, sheriff-- legal-like. I want him charged with murder. Murder? For the murder of Joe kirk, the Indian agent at rock Springs. You're all wrong. Grogan couldn't have done it. He was on the stage with me. Remember? You joined US later. He couldn't have been within 50 miles of the Indian agency. Maybe not, but he's mixed up in it somewhere, or he wouldn't have had this. Whoever killed my dad took this ring from his finger. Are you sure that's the same ring? I made it myself. Hammered it out of a piece of silver. Well, I don't know just what to say. Neither does grogan... Right now. Hey, grogan, are you in there? Yeah, I'm here. Hey, I hear they want to hang you for the agency murder. That was the old man's kid you tackled with. I'm not worryin'. I wasn't anywhere near the Indian territory. The sheriff's my alibi. No, I'm not worried, crandall. You see, I happen to know who did kill Joe kirk. Yeah? Yeah, and I could talk. Yeah? Go on, keep talking. What else? Well, if you boys would cut me in on, say, half of what you took out of that agency safe, my mouth would be shut tight. Sure. We'll cut you in, grogan. Thanks, Matt. Right now. Hey, you want to take a look at coco and see how nice he looks all dressed up with that saddle of yours on him? Bring him over here. Oh. [ Laughs ] Is this the way you always cinch up a saddle? Sure. It hurts his breathing when it's tight. Sort of hurts your, uh, head when it's loose, doesn't it? You wouldn't want to wear a size 15 collar on a 17 neck, would you? Aw, that's hurtin' him. There's room for one more, happy. Climb aboard. Oh, no, not me. It might take me a little longer, but I'll take the wear and tear out on my two feet. All right. I'll see you in town. Hey, kid, what are you running away from? That hot lead you've been threatening. What's the idea?Quit bluffing, kid. I'm taking you in for the murder of honest John grogan. Grogan?yeah, grogan. Let's go, and don't try any of your fancy Indian tricks. All right. Looks pretty bad for you, kirk. You picked a fight with grogan in the saloon over the ring. You dragged him here and you locked him up. You still have the key. I'll take it. Why don't you listen to reason, sheriff? Maybe grogan didn't do the actual killing, but it's just like I told you-- him having that ring proves that he was close to whoever did. Why, him being dead is the last thing I wanted. I'd have been crazy to kill him. Dead men can't talk. Your argument's got a lot of weight, but no one was in this office after you left last night. That doesn't prove anything. No, that's right. Come with me. During the night, grogan was called to the window and shot through the bars. How about that, kid? I told you, I wanted him alive so he could talk. Hey, what's that? Buckshot. Buckshot. Well, how about it, sheriff? Are you gonna hold me? No. Can I have my gun? Be careful how you use that hardware, kid. I'm careful about everything. Morning, winifred.Hi, happy. If you're going my way, I'm going yours.Sure, jump in. What you going into town so early for? I'm having a birthday soon, and I want a cake with candles on it. Mom's making the cake, but I gotta get the candles. I'll bake you a pie, and you can put the candles on that. Oh, thanks so much, happy, but I've tasted your pies. Huh? Oh. I never saw him before. You haven't? Why, he's bunkin' with me. That's my coco I sold him. Jumpin' Jupiter, what you burnin' up leather for? I came back to get you. What you nudging me for, winnie? Oh, miss winifred mcmasters, this is the navajo kid. Glad to know you. Climb up behind me, happy. Oh, no, I'm satisfied with this seat right here. I'll see you in town. Happy tells me that you're bunking with him. If you haven't anything else to do, I'd like to have you come to my birthday party. I'd be glad to. Oh, fine. Listen, we'll both be there, even if I have to ride sidesaddle on a mule. Say, happy, I want you to show me the man who fed that buckshot to your bullfrog. Oh, sure, I will, but right now I gotta get some breakfast for hopalong. You'd remember him, wouldn't you?Who, hopalong? No, the man who fed him that buckshot. Oh, sure, you bet your life I will. Hey, how about some coffee? Well, you'll have to wait for it to boil first. I just got here myself. But it won't take long. How long? J-Just a couple of minutes and I'll have it for you. How's your bullfrog, pardner? How far can he jump this morning? Yeah, you're the fella that fed my bullfrog buckshot, aren't you? Now how'd you guess that? Morning.howdy. I'll be back. Coffee, happy. Yes, sheriff. Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like I broke some of the candles for your birthday cake. That's all right. There's still plenty left. I'm, um, counting on you coming to my party. I'd sure like to, but-- now, no buts about it. There aren't many young people in canyon city, and old people aren't much fun. I hope you won't disappoint me. I'll try not to. Oh, Mr. Landon. Mother wants me to remind you to come to my birthday party. I didn't know you were giving a party, winnie. It isn't really a party. Cake and a few friends-- the usual thing. I just invited Mr., um... I can't think of his name. You mean the navajo kid, Tom kirk?Yes. Maybe you shouldn't have done that, winnie. I've already had a run-in with him. He seems to bring trouble wherever he goes. Well, then, sheriff, you must come to my party-- to protect me. How long's that navajo kid gonna stick around here?I never asked him. He bunks with you, don't he? Sure, but if he talks in his sleep, I never listen because I'm asleep myself. Say, are you as dumb as you look? Oh, n-no. Dumber. Excuse me. I think my pies are burning. We gotta get that kid, and no missing this time. Crandall: If you're so fancy on the draw, you get him. I will. I-I gotta deliver a pie in a hurry. Well, who's stopping you? N-Nobody, nobody. We wouldn't have nothing to worry about if you hadn't lifted that ring off the agent, crandall. Well, I did. Now you go on out and lift that kid out of his boots. You gotta be back here in five minutes. Less than that. I don't know what they're framing, but that sidewinder Bo talley was checking his gun. I tell ya, he's out gunnin' for ya. I heard you were looking for me. You heard right, talley. I'll take that gun. Well, kid, what have you got to say? I was standing there at the bar talking to happy. That's right, sheriff. I was telling him that talley was out gunnin' for him. I saw the whole thing, Landon. Self-defense I'd call it. Anyone else got anything to say? The big feller knocked the little feller for a tail-twister, then was gonna blast him with his gun while he was on the floor. Yeah, but look who's on the floor now. You seem to have plenty of witnesses backing you up, but the law says you've got to stand trial. Come along. Hey, that's the navajo kid with the sheriff. I wonder what happened to Bo talley. Kind of slow on the draw if you ask me. I don't like this. We'd better get out of town. Sure, we will. But we'll be back to get our dough out of the blue moon's safe. This time I'll keep the key. But you heard what they all said, sheriff. I shot him in self-defense. Yeah, I heard it, but you're still going to stand trial. I'll bet you would put your own grandmother in jail. Maybe, if she committed a crime. And I'll tell you something else-- I'd see that she got a fair trial. So will you. Happy: Hey, navajo, are you there? Sure, I'm in here. Where'd you think I'd be? You gotta be somewhere else in an awful hurry, too. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, coco. If you don't pull on that rope, I'm gonna put hopalong in your feed bag. Thataboy! Whoa, now. Nice going, happy. Come on, you gotta hurry now. See if you can find my gun. I think it's in the sheriff's office.I'll get it. Here it is. You gotta get out of here. Wait a minute, happy. I don't know what's gonna happen or when I'll be back. I want you to take care of this for me. Sure. What is it? There's some things in there that belonged to my mother. Hey, look, there's the sheriff. Get your horses, men! The navajo kid broke jail. I want him. Well, he's pulled off the trail. Start searching both sides. I want that kid, dead or alive. You seen murdock? He ain't here to give US that dough. You're right, hedges. I shouldn't have given it to him to keep for US. I told you that. And I'm telling you now, we came back here too soon. It ain't healthy for US around here, and you know it. The kid got Bo talley. How do we know who's next? Why, it might even be you. It ain't gonna be me. His horse isn't here, but that doesn't mean that he isn't inside. You cover the back door, Steve. Come on, winnie, hurry up and blow out the candles so we can eat the cake. Good! Here we go. Winnie: I get the first cut. I want to make a wish. Oh, sure. Happy birthday, winnie. Oh, thanks, Mr. Landon. Sorry to spoil your party by taking so many of the boys out of town, but it couldn't be helped. We're having loads of fun. You want a piece of cake? No, thank you, not right now. I want to talk to happy. Oh, of course. You wouldn't by any chance be knowing where the navajo kid is, would you? Why, he's in jail, isn't he? No, he's not in jail. Of course, you didn't have anything to do with helping him break jail, did you? Oh, no, sheriff, you know I wouldn't do anything-- look, you don't need to worry. He'll be back all right. What makes you think he'll be back? Well, because he gave me a little package and told me to take care of it for him. You mind letting me see it? Well, I guess it's all right. You be sure and give it back, now. He said that it belonged to his mother. He left this with you, happy? Yes, sir. I gave this to my wife just before we were married. Happy, if you know where the navajo kid is, talk. I've gotta find that boy before my men do. You mean he's your son?There's no doubt about it. Come along with me, happy. I'm telling you, Matt, I don't like this hiding out. There's no telling where that infernal kid is. If it wasn't for that dough, we could put distance between US and canyon city. Oh, stop bellyaching. We'll get that dough out of murdock's safe and blow. Shouldn't have been in there in the first place. We should have kept it on ourselves. Yeah, well, don't worry. We'll go get it-- as soon as I find out we've lost the kid. Hey, your horse must have wandered off. You better go find him if you don't want to walk back to canyon city. It wouldn't be me. Now start talkin'. Which one of you killed kirk? I ain't gonna say nothin'. No? The navajo showed me a way to make a man talk. Well? All right, I'll talk. It was Matt crandall. Matt crandall fired the shot that got him, and talley and me robbed the safe. That's all I want to know. [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots continue ] Whoever they were, their horses are headed for town. I've come for that little package you put in the safe for me, murdock. Come back tomorrow, crandall. I'm closed for the night. I won't be here tomorrow. Open that safe. Say, what is this, a holdup? You heard what I said. Open that safe. Got the time, crandall? I'm over here, crandall. You missed me by six feet. Your time's run out, crandall. Don't get the wrong idea, mister. This money belongs to the government. Hey, kid! Put up your guns. That's an order. The kid is mine. Drop your gun, kid. I want you. It's the other way around, sheriff. Drop yours. Do as I tell you. I've got to talk to you. Go ahead. If you've got something to say, I'm listening. D-Don't do it. Don't do it, kid. You can't. He's your father.What? What did you say, happy? I was trying to tell you that he's your old man. He's right, kid. I didn't mean to wing you. I was trying to get your gun. I had to tell you this. Happy showed me that locket that you left with him. I gave that locket to your mother just before we were married. Look, those are our pictures-- your mother and myself. It all ties in now. You are my son. Crandall: Take your hands off me. You got nothing on me. Well, you're a pretty good shot, kid, but you didn't figure on my watch stopping it. This is the watch he took from Joe kirk after he killed him. Strange that this timepiece should have saved you from killing him. Got the time, mister? Where he's going, happy, he'll have plenty of time. I'm holding him for the United States marshal. You know, winnie, if it hadn't been for that birthday party of yours that I spoiled... You mean if the kid hadn't given happy that locket and the ring, we might never have known. Son, if you ever need a wedding ring, you couldn't find a better one than this. Folks. Oh, folks. What are you doing here, happy? I thought you had taken hopalong to the sweepstakes. Hopalong has been scratched. He's got too many responsibilities now. And if you don't believe it, just take a look at this. [ All laughing ]
