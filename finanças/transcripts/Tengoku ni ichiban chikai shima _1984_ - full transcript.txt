This is one tale of The Island Closest to Heaven See this river? If you follow it all the way out, it leads you to the sea. If you keep going, way to the south, all the way to the other side of the world, there's a small island made of pure white coral. That's the island closest to where God is in heaven. If anyone, anywhere wants to meet God God will go down to that island and go out to find them from there. That's right. Because it's closest to heaven the sun is always shining. It's very bright and very warm. The people on the island are always very happy. How do you get there? You ask God to take you. Ask with all your might, and he'll do it. How do you ask him? Please take me there Have you ever gone there? No, I've never been able to ask properly That's so sad. But someday, we'll go there. Together? That'd be nice. I'll ask with all my might. That's right. - But I don't know. - What? The name of the island. New Caledonia. Don't worry, father. I won't cry. My sandal is just going to the island before we do. Let's make sure we go there someday. Both of us, together. Mari and father, together. "The Island Closest to Heaven" It's just like your father to die on us so suddenly like this. He was always so caught up in his fantasies it was like he was already in the next world. But Mari... that's just what you needed in a father. Don't you think so? Of course, he was good to me as a husband, too. Won't you say something, Mari? I wonder what made you such a gloomily silent girl. You'll be even lonelier now, won't you? Excuse me, please fasten your seatbelt. You're Mari, right? Yes, Katsuragi… Nice to meet you! We'll be together for the whole trip! I'm Fukuko Yamamoto I'm almost 20. What about you? I'm 16. But I'm almost 17. Nice to meet you. How nice! I'm so excited for this! A real blue Christmas! So much fun, I can't handle it! By the way, Mari... who did you deceive? What? I told daddy I was going to New Caledonia to study French. He bought it, and paid up! You know money in French? Argent So much "argent!" Fess up! Who'd you deceive? My mother used her savings Oh, well done! Learning to rip off your parents is an important skill… Mother... What is it? I'd like to visit New Caledonia. Where's that? Africa? No It's a small island near Australia. I see. If it's outside of Asakusa, I don't know it. Why do you want to visit New Cale... whatever it was? I made a promise with father A promise? With your father? When? A long time ago. When I was very small. Why now? Well, that's fine. You're so gloomy all the time. You hardly say anything so if you're asking for this... it must be important to you. Just go. You might as well. When your father died, I thought I'd be through dealing with his fantasies. Why are you so much like your father that way? I'm sorry. You need money, right? 100,000 Yen? 200,000? Thank you very much. Don't worry. I have some savings you can use. It's just as well. I've always wanted to be alone. It's been very trying for me. All alone, with no one to be a nuisance to me. I can drink a bit of saké on my own, and think back upon my memories of my dear, departed husband. I'll get lonely and cry a bit. Mother I'm very happy You're finally doing something on your own. It's thanks to your father, isn't it? Have a good trip. Thank you. Let's go. Tonight is Chrismas eve. We'll be giving everyone champagne. Go on, try some! Cheers, Mari! To the success of our adventure! It's okay. We're not in Japan anymore. In France, even children drink wine. Just drink it! It's not your first, is it? I tried it once with my mother. See! No big deal! Check this out... I smuggled some whiskey on board, too! À votre santé! Drink it up! Here... Drink up! Attention. We will land in Noumea soon. Please fasten your seatbelts. On this trip, Christmas is in midsummer! Thank you for joining our Santa Claus tour! We will be arriving in Noumea soon. You'll be spending the night at the fine Le Surf Hotel as you were informed by the travel agency at Narita airport First, we'll check in, and then you'll be free to explore until dinner. Enjoy the fresh air and sea of New Caledonia We'll have a small Christmas party at dinner. Over here! No, this way! Over here! Oh, Mari! What's with the outfit? Where's your swimsuit? I'm going out for a bit. You're going out? Where? All alone? See you. Is your hangover all right? I'm fine. What a drag. Let's go! Let's go! No, not here. Was it really here, father? Thanks! Are you all right? Try to stand up. Are you Japanese? You're not injured? Are you all right? Yes You sure you're all right? Just a little... My glasses! Glasses? Sunglasses? No, ordinary glasses with red frames. Glasses with red frames... Oh, there! These? Yes, those! It looks like they've been damaged I'm sorry. It's fine. They were cheap anyway. That won't do. Glasses are very important! I'm sorry. It's all right. I'm very sorry. It's really all right. I'm always clumsy anyway. How do I get back to Le Surf Hotel? Turn left up ahead, and you'll get back there. I can take you in my truck. That's okay. I can get back on my own. But, will you be all right? Oh, right. I'm always clumsy with my truck. Oh no! Thank you! Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't move. You kids are always wandering around recklessly and getting yourselves hurt. Starting tomorrow, you'll stay with the group! Right, Fukuko? She's just having a little adventure. Can I take one of these? It's not a toy! Dinner's starting soon. Don't be late! Yes Papa, quickly! We're models! Okay, pose just like that! - One more! - Yes! That's my type. Masculine, but refined. Too bad he has two kids. Let's try it. - Let's go, papa! - Papa, let's go! Papa, look at the market! Yes, that's right. You're a very observant girl This is the town marketplace. It's an important center for the Noumean way of life. Stop! Let me off! This Santa Claus Tour has been proudly and carefully arranged. I cannot allow you to miss our tour! You should have asked his address, or phone number! You're right. What's his name? About that… I forgot to ask him. You really are careless. Yes. I really am careless. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine. You'll see him again. You already did twice! It's a small town Fukuko! Will you take a picture with us? Let's do it, Yasui! Come on, let's go! Then I'll go. The immigrants are resting below here. It's an awfully big gravestone, isn't it? Let's say a small prayer so the Japanese people here can rest peacefully. Let's finish this. What is this? A submarine? From Japan? It's a grave for the people in the submarine? All right, everyone. This way, please. Quickly! Yes, there are bats here. Let's keep going. Are you surprised? That bird is unique to New Caledonia. It's called a "cagou." It doesn't know it's a bird, so it barks like a dog. It's like a canary that forgot how to sing. In this place... There are a lot of strange animals. Like the ostrich. A bird that forgot how to fly, so its pride is its speed. But it isn't just the birds. What about the people? No, I don't mean you. But me, perhaps? This way, please! Certainly those specimens! They look like humans, but they've forgotten how to be human. Hey, everyone! Welcome to New Caledonia! Don't forget to look past the normal tour. You can go to the disco or casino tonight! You can fly freely, like birds. I'll be your guide for Noumea's nightlife. How about it? You again? Don't listen to this man! He's an unlicensed guide! A fraud! You're the fraud! You go to the same sites as every other tour. A real guide should help them discover this place for themselves. Who asked you? If I followed your advice, I'd lose my livelihood, and my house! Let's go, everyone! If you please. What? Mari! You? There's something I'm looking for. Please help me. You can't do this! If anything happens, who'll be responsible? Your parents will blame me! It's fine! I'll take you out tonight. Let's go! Please. All right, let's go. No, don't go with him! Don't get in her way! Let's go! Satisfied? You're an odd one. I've never seen anyone so fixated on the market. - Looking for someone? - Yes. Why so intently? Is it your boyfriend? No, it's not that. "The island closest to heaven" Who told you that? My late father. Your father? When I was little, he always told me about it. A fairy tale, then. He said everyone on the island is happy. That's not here. It isn't Noumea. I wonder if it's another island. Another island… Yes Are there other islands here? Sure. Lîle des Pains, Lifou, Ouvéa There's lots of little islands made of coral deposits. Coral deposits… How do you get there? By plane. Cessna flies there. Plane... It must be expensive. Did your father have a picture? No Then how can be sure it's his island? You'll be searching for ever. I'll know. When I get there, and I see it, I'll know it right away. It's the island my father promised. We're here. There's something I want to show you. Hurry! There's no time. Where are we going? Wait! We made it! I'm sorry. I'm going back. Please! The sun... the moment the sun sinks into the sea You might see the horizon turn green. It's said the people who see that green will be able to find what they're looking for. I've never seen it before. But I hope that you can see it. Now! Did you see it? I'm sorry. I'm no good at this. It's fine. Let's go. Yes. Maybe it's just an optical illusion. Related to complementary colors. Complimentary colors? If you stare at red light for too long, then look at something else, it looks green. It works the other way, too. But why did you want to take me here? 20 years ago I brought someone here who saw the green light, so I thought you might, too. Do I remind you of that person? No, not at all. There's no one like them. What's your name? Katsuragi. Katsuragi? Mari Katsuragi. My name is Yuichi Fukaya. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Will you go out with me tonight, Mari? What? But… Frightened? No, you're not frightening. Then why not? I don't know anything about you. When people first meet they're always strangers. But isn't it lonely if everyone is a stranger? Yes. I have an idea! An idea? We'll visit Lîle des pains The island? Yes You can dress up and get all made up like an adult - Let's go back to the hotel. - Yes. That's a good girl. Let's go. It's gotten quite dark. Do you want to bet on whether we'll find your "island closest to heaven?" Your lucky number is... nine. That's all? That's no good. Don't hesitate when you're calling for good fortune.. Well done. Nine! You did it! Incredible! It looks like the sky. It does, doesn't it? Or like we're in a submarine. Silly! Like we're seeing the wind. I see. You're incredible, Mr. Fukaya. Winning money for a plane ticket at roulette! But what would we have done if we'd lost? If you believe in them you can achieve your dreams. Right, right. Wait a minute. - He said go to the beach - Who? Tom. My friend. Yuichi! Bonjour! Voila! The book I promised you. Incredible! This is Tom. This is Mari Katsuragi. Hello! Let's go. We'll climb the tallest mountain on the island. Tom agreed to lead us. We're almost there. Let's race to the top! Let's do it. Go! Well, Mari? See anything that looks like your "island closest to heaven?" This is a beautiful, incredible island. But it's not the one. I don't know how I can tell, but when I find the island closest to heaven I know exactly how I'll feel. But doesn't this look like it? I'm sorry. My island closest to heaven… doesn't look like any other. I see. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I won't forget how kind you've been. No, don't worry about it. You're very charming and sincere, I respect that sincerity. Thank you, Mr. Fukaya. Really, thank you. I'm very happy. What a great feeling! Fukuko! Mari! Why are you here? I've been looking for you all morning! You were here? Why are you here? It was an optional extra. Isn't this a romantic spot? Miss Katsuragi! You again! This is awful! The Santa Claus tour has never had an incident like this Mari, this is perfect. You can get back with these people. What about you? I'm thinking maybe I'll just stay. I have lots to talk about with Tom. Mari. Keep having a good trip. But... I hope you find your "island closest to heaven" soon. What about you? Our tour is over. The one who decided that… is you. Goodbye. I can't go too far off-shore. It's a pretty song, isn't it? Thank you. My wife liked it very much. What luck! I wanted to see you again. You were all right? Yes, I was fine. Your wound? Here. I think it's probably Ouvea. - Ouvea? - Yes. It's a small island, due east of here It sparkles brightly at night I see. What did you do? I can't get there. I have no money for another plane. That's fine. There's a boat! A boat? That's how people who live there get to and from here. Can I ride one, too? It's almost new years, There should be a boat going there this afternoon How much does it cost? It's free. I'm friends with the son of the chief of a village there. He can take you. What an incredible friend! Yes. But I don't have any Japanese friends. Why not? Aren't there a lot of Japanese people who live here? You can spend New Years Day on Ouvea. Does that work for you? I have to leave the night after tomorrow I see. I'll come get you at your hotel at 3. Then we'll go to the boat Thank you. "Thank you." What an incredible word. It's my favorite word in Japanese. And it's the one that suits you best. Thank you. What is it? My name is Mari Katsuragi. I'm Taro Watanabe. Taro Watanabe... Taro Watanabe. There are bungalows for overnight stay, but there's no bath or shower, little electricity and frequent blackouts. It's terrifying. There isn't even a toilet! Why do you insist on going off on your own all the time? Give it a rest, Aoyama sweetie. I'll go out with you again tonight if you let her go, okay? This isn't a joke. I can't snag a French boy, and Japanese men are so unreliable. And you're never around Good thing we're going home soon! I just have to wait two more days. Mari. - I'll be back later! - Be careful! Hello This is Jerome. His father is a chief on Ouvea. Nice to meet you. Jerome can speak English. Can you? That late? The morning after tomorrow? Thank goodness. I can make my flight. That was dangerous. Almost made another mistake. This is Taro's friend Mari. She came here from Japan. Please look after her. We are the children of the sun. Hello, Mari! Thank you. Mari Katsuragi Father I finally made it here. It's very beautiful. Don't you think the people and nature are the best on earth? But I don't know. I still don't know. Let me know, will you father. Your "island closest to heaven"... where is it? Please let me know, father. I have no time. Tell me: is this it? Why won't you tell me father? Is this our "island closest to heaven?" Don't worry. She just tried to learn too much at once A girl always gets a fever when she becomes an adult. Father Jeez. Again? You were stung by a ray? I was terrified! I'm fed up! What is it with you, anyway? This is what happens when you go out on your own! If I hadn't searched for you, you'd be stuck here forever! Your flight back to Japan was the day before yesterday, but here you are! Look! The guests for the next tour are already here! In any case, I've moved you here. Moved? I'm switching hotels? Yes. The next flight isn't for another week. You'll have to pay extra. And for a seat on the next flight, too! As you can see, we're already full. Unless there's someone else like you, there won't be a seat on the next flight We have limited seats, so you'll have to pay normal price. But... One other thing. The fee for the boat from Ouvea, and the officer's you have to pay it! It's eye-poppingly expensive. You can't pay, can you? The company will send you the bill when you get home Your father can pay, can't he? Don't say that! Don't say it like that! Like this? Who are you to tell me that? You're the one who caused the trouble! When you're on my tour, you're my responsibility. Got it? Stop making that sad face, and don't tell me how to talk! I'm in charge! Don't make fun of me! This... always having to make a sweet face for customers. Got it? They always want so many things. It's infuriating. I wish I could go back to Japan. I have a wife and son there. We could go to the beach in Chiba on holidays, then come back and have some yakiniku and put my son to bed when we get home, and have a cold beer and relax. Mari! Miss Katsuragi! Miss Mari Katsuragi. Umm, therefore because of that... I'm not rich. Umm, here... It's all I have. You need it, right? I should have asked where the office was. I'm so forgetful. Taro! I found you! Here's your girlfriend. Thank you. In any case, you can stay with me It's a small farm, but I live there with my father and sister, Yukiko. A farm? Yes. My father is second generation, so I'm third generation. My grandfather came here to dig for nickel. No one's been back since. My father was 18 when the war started. He decided he wanted to be buried here, so he married a half Melanesian woman. That's my mother. If you follow the sea north, there's a country called Japan My mother told me about that place often It was the land of her dreams. My mother died when I was 8. My dream is that one day, I'll have enough money to go to Japan. I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. No, it's fine. It's wonderful to hear. Let's go. But I found you. That's a relief. It was me who sent you to Ouvea so I was shocked when Jerome told me. I went to the hotel and they told me everything I'm sorry. I'm always getting into trouble. How's your injury? It's completely healed. Look! No, I mean the one from the stingray. What's would you most like to do now? I want to take a bath. A Japanese one. Could you get the things in my mailbox? Sure! We're here! Welcome home, Taro! This is Yukiko. She's like my little sister. Hello. Hello. I'll introduce you. My father. Nice to meet you. This way. This is my room. It's not very clean, but... Thank you for everything. Use anything you'd like - Yes. - Yukiko. The bath. Enjoy! That must have been trying. But it turned out okay. Please take it easy here Yes, thank you. Will big sister live with us? She'll take the next plane back No fun! I want her to stay. I'm sorry. Good night. Good night. Night! Your late grandfather always said... The butt of a horse doesn't match the butt of a cow. She may be Japanese, but she's not like us. Because we live here. Japanese tourists are very different from us. This is my mother's grave. Right next to my grandparents. Yukiko's parents died on Ouvea. I'll take her there to visit them on Sunday. Then you'll come back? No, not just that. Yukiko has plans with the children there Yukiko (snow child) has never seen snow. Her grandmother was from northern Japan, and named her that from nostalgia. I've never seen snow, either. Won't you rest a bit, Mari? I have some work to do. Taro is sumo wrestling the tree! It's been causing us trouble for a week. I'll help! It wouldn't help. Big brother! Big sister! Try hard! With all your might! Mari! Taro! All your might! You did it! You did it! You did it! Let me take you to Noumea this afternoon What? But... I'm very sorry. Our house is too small, and too dirty. And... I have to take Yukiko to Ouvea. I'm very sorry. I visited here once, about 20 years ago. And Miss Ishikawa here was with me then, too Keiko is a very famous essayist. She met you then for one of her columns. We're very indebted to you. I know all about Noumea's history. I remember the sinking of that submarine well. These days the young people don't think much of it it's just an incident of history. But some of the elderly still make a fuss No, no, it's not unreasonable. You are? I'll introduce her. This is my son's friend Mari Katsuragi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Shall we head out? Ah, yes. This woman is Miss Ishikawa. Her husband was on the submarine that sank. She's asked me to take her there. Let me come, too! You have to help your brother. Won't you come with us? The sea down here is so remarkable. Good, good. This way, Yukiko. If it's okay, I'll bring your bag to your hotel later. But... I know the front man at the Mikado hotel Just tell him my name. He'll give you the bag. Bye! See you soon! The way our friends treated us changed very suddenly. We had Japanese ancestry, so we were potentially enemies. We weren't put in internment camps, though. I guess we were lucky. There was a Japanese POW camp on the island, but ...how should I put it. It's strange to think about, but... it looked like the POWs were more free than us. Their food looked good. We only got the leftovers. I think it was somewhere around here. The submarine surfaced, and some airplanes fired at it. That was its last stand. It was almost like a suicide. I could see the fighting from that hill. But of course, I couldn't say anything. I couldn't cheer for the Japanese ship, because I live here. It was so bungled up. They're from the same place as my father but I could only watch them get shot at. Then, suddenly... suddenly the submarine began to sink. I couldn't tell which explosion caused it. It just started to disappear from view, and then it didn't come back up again. Thank you very much. I'm sorry to make you talk about it. No, not at all. But the landscape has changed somewhat since then so I can't be sure of the spot. No, it's here. There's no mistaking it. It's here. You must have been lonely all this time. I've kept the ring you gave me. I hid it when they tried to collect our metals. I thought I should, since it's something you gave me. If I have to give it back, I should give it back to you. Here it is now. Please remember me and rest peacefully. I feel relieved. Thank you all for joining me. Please tell us. 39 years later What do you remember most of all? That... is something I'm embarrassed to share. It's love, and pride in him. That I fell in love with someone I can be proud of. I'm not very eloquent, but isn't that what love is? I'll never forget how I felt when I fell in love with him. In the end, love is… the story of your whole life. Mari Katsuragi hasn't come here What? I'll let you know if she does. But I heard she went to a hotel with an older woman. I'll have someone help you with her bag. Sorry to inconvenience you. Thanks. Taro. You shouldn't fall in love with a tourist. You'll end up lonely. What a nice hotel. It was noisy over there, but we're the only ones here. I needed the peace. Have some tea. Yes. You must be hungry Let's eat something delicious. We've been invited by someone named Madame Hiroko. Let's go! Yes Mari What are you... Mr. Fukaya! You Keiko I read you were coming in the paper I didn't come to see you. I know that. But I came to see you Go back We're going out soon. I read your essay, "When Love is Broken," in one of the women's journals. I found it very moving. Thank you very much Why did you follow me here? Are you trying to cause trouble? I'll go soon. But there's one thing I want to tell you I'll be waiting for you on our hill at sunset. The one where we made our promise. Keiko I'm still just a child, and am very clumsy and I don't understand adult relationships But Mr. Fukaya really loves you. That's all I know. I'm telling you because I like Mr. Fukaya a lot. But Mr. Fukaya already found the love of his life. That's you. 20 years ago, when the sun set into the sea there was someone with him who saw the green light. That person is the one that Mr. Fukaya loves, even now. You came. 20 years. It's been 20 years. I'm an old lady now. I've even been married once. Keiko Mari Katsuragi You love that girl, don't you? I understand. It's because of her that I came to see you. She's just like you at that age I tried to see if I could get another chance with her here But it's over now. I lost my chance, and there's nothing left for me. Mari Katsuragi... Her life is just beginning now. That's what made me realize it. She's a very wise girl. Just like you were back then. I was so silly at her age. But I came back because I'm a bit wiser now. Believe it, will you? Keiko. Could you see the green light again? No, not anymore. I'm also finished. There's nothing left for me, either. That's a relief. The green light… It didn't see it either. Never. Apart from you. Use this money to return to Japan. My dream is to raise enough money to go to Japan one day. Please. I need to get to Ouvea somehow. There's someone I have to find again. Please take me there. I have money, but... I can't use it. I understand. I'll send you there. Am I being unreasonable? It's okay. Life is not long. You need to be unreasonable sometimes. Mari! You can go home to Japan A silly person is giving their plane ticket away. Mari. Thank you. It's thanks to you. Oh, big sister! Mari Taro You made it I wanted to see you again. Here. Let me give this back to you. Thank you very much. I can't take anything from you. No, I didn't want to take money. Instead, I'll go home with the beautiful memories that you gave me. We won't meet again, will we? Thank you very much. I should thank you. - Taro? - Yes? Can I ask one more favor. Yes. What is it? Would you let me see your picture show? Picture show? Please I see. If you follow this sea all the way to the north, there's an island shaped like a seahorse That island is called "Japan." This island has flowers that are more beautiful than you've ever seen Their blossoms fill the island. Spring has spring flowers, summer has summer flowers autumn has autumn flowers, and then in winter... winter flower blossoms called snow fall from the sky. That's like my name! Yes. When it's winter... God covers the ground that's been polluted with a white blanket of snow. - Snow is a white flower? - Right. It's white, cold, and fluffy. It's like sherbet. Is it sweet? No, it's not sweet. But when it snows, everyone feels beautiful inside, just like God. So all the people on the island are always very happy. What's wrong? What's wrong, big sister? Thank you, Taro. I found it. What? I found it. My "island closest to heaven"... is here. It's right here. It's right in front of me. It's right in front of me, with you, Taro. This is my "island closest to heaven." Thank you, Mari. I found it, too. I found my "Japan" Actually, my Japan is you, Mari Taro Mari Big sister Thank you. See this river? If you follow it all the way out, it leads you to the sea. If you keep going, way to the south, all the way to the other side of the world, there's a small island made of pure white coral. That's the island closest to where God is in heaven. If anyone, anywhere wants to meet God God will go down to that island and go out to find them from there. And just so that it doesn't hurt when God lands there, it's covered in a carpet of fluffy flower blossoms. Yes, yes. Because it's closest to heaven the sun is always shining. It's always bright and warm. The people on the island are always very happy. Everyone... Welcome home! I'm home. You came to meet me? The travel agency called me. They said you were back, and would come this way Were you worried? Parents are always worried. Do I seem different? Oh, you don't have glasses. You've been very quiet, mother. Won't you say something? Happy New Year, ma'am. Happy New Year. Your daughter is home She's got a nice tan What is it? Oh dear. It's snowing. Snowing? Where? Look! It's coming down! Oh, it is! Mother, mother! What? I met with father there. I see Yes. I wonder how he split in two What? He was here with me the whole time. You're unfair, mother. Goodbye days of youth... Thank you The Island Closest to Heaven I shouldn't just think of myself when I think about achieving my dream there's a place I really like When we meet and fall in love you're my personal God love, ordinary love, a whisper turns your lips into precious jewels Love more than anyone The island closest to you in heaven Love, plain love, a smile draws a rainbow in your eyes Love more than anyone The island closest to you in heaven Subtitles by smilethebeachboysloveyou Proofread by EvanM Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi
