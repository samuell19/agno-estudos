Do the clinical studies of psychiatrists concur with the psychological analyses of novelists? We asked writers to draw portraits of psychopathic personalities using nothing more than their talent and imagination. Will doctors find some of the main symptoms of their clinical patients in these strictly fictional representations? Marguerite Duras has drawn us a portrait of the "psychopathic personality of an alcoholic". DARK NIGHT CALCUTTA Adaptation: Paul J. Memmi I Jennifer Kaku Subtitling: Nice Fellow I have come here to write a novel. It is the story of a man I have imagined. He is silent, naive... lacking audacity. He will let any chance for happiness slip by. I have made him vice-consul of France in Calcutta. Vice-consul: a mediocre occupation, but safe... and which misleads. Calcutta... infinite city of the lassitude of being... I must now tell of his failure, his shattered dream, and how Calcutta, slowly, will fully expose his solitude, his banality, his anxiety, so tight. I must invent Calcutta, completely. Its heat. Fans everywhere, rustling like startled birds... The love felt, meeting a woman. My luck is the greatest there is. If I do not succeed, I will not kill myself. I will return to Paris. The living dead. I will continue doing what I have done. No one will know. How difficult! How to attack this fortress? It seems impregnable, all of a sudden. Words exist somewhere, hidden, for the moment. But I know them all. All of them! They will come to me. the woman is blond. the woman he meets is also Calcutta. The beggar is Calcutta. The vice-consul of France, as well. What is this thing I want to describe? What is its nature? This thing I want to do... To write! What is its nature? Solitude... I returned it. I didn't keep it to myself, like the others. What do the others do? I turned this fetid pocket inside out. Tomorrow it will be seen. I do not know what this book will be. What I know is, it's taken my place. I am no longer anything. Describe endlessly: the night of Calcutta. An enormous egg. Black. Miasmic. Clouds gather above the mouth of the Ganges... in a Himalaya. A beggar, infested with fleas, is squatting in the water of the rivers near the banks where the carps lie sleeping. She is watching out for them, and she eats them raw. I don't want to go to England. I don't want to! I don't want to anymore. You will stay here for a while. You can come to my place, you know that. No... If I stay, I'll stay at the hotel. I would like that room for myself alone. Actually, I'm fine here. You're here... and I like that beach. Did you speak to Jean? What did he say? What is he holding against you? Everything, I think... I don't know. - Is it over for you? - How can anyone know? You can know, I think. Horrible city... Horrible vermin everywhere. The reek of the mud, stirred by the fans... He did not go over to her. to waste one's time, one's youth... Those naive words she must be using... I would like to tell of her despair. A great swelling wave, a smooth roll flooding through her... The lover must have left a couple of days ago. His name is Jean. I overheard. The woman in Calcutta is blond. I will invent her tomorrow. The sky is nothing. Haze... He meets her at a French Embassy reception. He asks her to dance. She speaks first. I don't know how to write this book anymore. Calcutta is dying. She is too. The Ganges no longer carries anything. Perhaps I am mistaken? I must begin again tomorrow. Calmly. Write every day... I will find the connection between all of these things. Begin at the beginning. I will tell everything. I can. I can do everything. What strength! What happiness! I will find the phrases. When did you find out? Yesterday. At Cabourg. He pulled out a flask from his pocket. Even when he walks! What are you going to do? Go to him. Why not? So that's how you are... Why is he here? To write a book. He told the bookseller, who told me. What kind of book? I don't know. So you see, he wants to be left alone. Any news about Jean? He's gone. He left me a note. He'll come back to see you. Will you go back to Paris? I think you should get some rest first. Sleep... One night... Dark... Miasmic... Dark, miasmic. An enormous egg... Alcoholic, what a joke... I can stop whenever I want... How do you start to describe emptiness? Had I been the soul she was seeking, I'd have approached her. Is there something you wanted to know? This is hell! The Ganges that carries the dead, the filth... I can't do it. It's impossible. Agony. It's simply impossible. So what is there to say? What is there to do?
