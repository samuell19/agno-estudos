What's up with your brother? He's away from home since 5 am. It's 7.30 now. He never wakes up so early. How would I know, dad? He wasn't in the room when I woke up. - So how can I... - What do you mean you don't know? You study in the same university. You must know something about your brother's whereabouts. Dad, we don't talk in the university. What happened? Vicky was away from home since 5 am. It's 7.30 now. How do you know he was away since 5 am? I'm keeping a watch. Why should you keep watch, Suresh? They're kids. You know about the sounds from his room. You too should keep a watch, understood? Suresh, please give him some time. You know what recently happened with Udita. The kid is upset. Is this some Bollywood film... ...that you ruin your life for a girl? Anita, you know I'm not educated but I'm getting them educated. I'm paying huge fees in universities. But these two worthless.... They want to waste all my efforts. - Why do you say that? - I feel I'm a ####... Hey... Mom, I face the brunt for his doings every time. - Every time. - You're no less. Huh? You don't want to study. You won't meet relatives. He just wants to have a good time. - Why rant at the kids early morning? - Mom,... ...it's time for my class. - I'm leaving. I pay for his doings... - Sagar, please... Hear me out, son. Did you hear that? Vicky? Vicky, what's happening? Vicky? Why is it locked? Vicky? Open the door. Please come here and check, what's happening Sagar, go in the backyard. Check at the back. Vicky?

Please call Kamlesh. Vicky... - Hello. - Kamlesh.... - What happened? - Listen... There's a problem with Vicky. Can you come? - Suresh... - Yes? - Tell me what happened. - I don't know... ....he's acting insane and ... ...banged his head on the wall till he bled. What? Yes, we've calmed him for now but.... ...he might... Can you come? Okay, I'll come right away. Until then... - ...stop the bleeding, okay? - Yes. Okay? I prescribed a sleeping pill last time, Anexil. - Give him one table so he can sleep. - Okay. - You... - I'm coming. Come soon. Listen, give him this medicine. Give water. Here. Take medicine... Son, have it. Medicine. Dad, cotton. Give the medicine. Hold this. Give. - Yes. - Clean the wound. Give. I'll check. No. The door was open, right? - Yes. - It must be Anju. Tell her to come tomorrow. - Okay, I'll tell her. - I'll go. Wait here, I'll be back. Here's the cotton, mom. There's no work today, you go. - But madam called me... - I said there is no work, go. - What happened? - The watchman said that boy lives here. Sir, Vicky came here in his rickshaw. He was waiting since long so I brought him here. He said he'll get money. He hasn't paid yet. How long do I wait? How much? It's 370... ...but you can pay me for waiting too. 300... He should've had that much amount. He had money, he gave it to poor children. I thought he'll have more. What? Why did he do that? How do I know? Just pay me. Okay wait here. Sagar! Yes, dad? - Pay the auto driver. - Okay. - Be sure to get the change of 100 bucks back. - Yes. I'll pay him. Listen, he... How much money did you give him yesterday? I gave him 8,000, his pocket money. Where's his wallet? I don't know, Suresh. Is everything fine, Kamlesh? He's a bit drowsy. And the wound on his head... - ...will heal, so don't worry about that. - This... He's sleeping now. - Will you have tea or coffee. - Let's talk. No, Anita. - Please sit. - Okay. Sagar, join us. Is everything fine? Anita, you heard him say some things... ....that we couldn't understand. I don't think he's sleeping well at all. Now try not to over react. But it'd be better if you immediately consult a psychiatrist. What are you saying, Kamlesh? It's no big deal.... What do you mean no big deal? You mean to say he is having a mental disorder? - Suresh, I didn't say that. - Then? Psychiatrist means a doctor for lunatics, right? Calm down. Suresh, please. Treat this matter sensitively. If you speak to Vikram with this tone... ...things will worsen. Please calm down. Uncle, may I say something? I'm talking to him, right? Let him speak, Suresh. - Always so loud. - Tell me, son. Uncle, well... ...these days he keeps to himself in the university. I met Yohan the other day... ...and he asked why he didn't come to the university. Uncle, he does go to the university... ....but he doesn't sit in the class. Did you speak to him about it? No, uncle. We have different groups. So, we never speak. Whenever I try to talk to him, he ignores me. What do I do with these kids? - Speak softly. - Suresh. Please stay calm right now. I'm prescribing this medication for him. This might help him sleep well. And I want you to meet Dr Neeta Upadhyay as soon as possible. She's a consultant in his university... ...and has a private clinic too. I'll ask her to give you an appointment soon. She's usually very very tied up. And also... ...Anita and you both must go. Okay? I don't know what to do. I know, Suresh. Today feels heavy. Just relax. It's going to be okay. Well, I've to leave for the hospital. - Sagar, you take care. - Yes, uncle. And keep updating your parents about Vikram from time to time. - Alright, son? - Thank you. Thank you. - Bye, Kamlesh. - Bye, Suresh. To see these fascinating birds.... - ...this is the right place. - Vicky. Medicines, son. It's late. Go to sleep. Want more? Give. Mom,... ...I know you're stressed. No. I'm not stressed at all. What makes you think that? I know. Final exams are coming up. If I don't score well,... ...you... So what? Don't think too much. Come, sleep. I anyway... ...never scored marks like Sagar. Vicky! Why are you saying that, son? Don't think about that. Come, take rest. I forgot to feed Chip Let's do that now. What happened? Vicky! What happened, son? I feel drowsy. Yes,... ....Kamlesh said... ..the medicine will do that. Are you okay? Come, everything's fine. You'll feel better if you sleep. Come. Come, my child. Sit. Come. Careful. Okay? Okay? The key of this? In the drawer? The key is lost. Then how? Chippy! Chippy! Chippy! Chippy! Cutie. Will you have food? You'll let mom feed you, baby! How many spoons? 2 spoons. 2 spoons are enough for this child? Baby! Little child. How will it fill you? Chippy. She won't eat. Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? Suresh... Suresh! - Yes? - Suresh, look at Vicky. Look he burnt all his hair. Suresh, look at Vicky. He... Suresh, look at Vicky. Get the chair. Move back. Suresh.... Vicky! Vicky... Make him sit here. Vicky... - Vicky.... - Get the ointment. Vicky, what are you doing to yourself? What are you doing? Hurry up. Apply the ointment and I... I'll call Dr Kamlesh. Get water. Get water. No Vicky.... Vicky.... - Apply this. - What are you doing? Vicky.... - I'll get water. - Please get water. Vicky.... - Hello. - Listen Kamlesh.... This matter is getting out of hand. What happened, Suresh? It's 4 am. Is everything fine? He just.... Vicky burnt his hair with the lamp in the temple. Oh my god! - Is he fine? - Yes. - How bad is it? - Well... ...I fear lest he burnt his skin along with the hair. Did he take the medicine before sleeping? Yes, he did seem drowsy. He didn't whimper despite the pain. Do one thing, give him one more tablet and put him to sleep. And reach Dr Neeta's clinic at 10 sharp. This case should be handled by a specialist. I'll get you an emergency appointment.... ...and send you the address. Okay. Call me if you need me. - Okay. - Please, Suresh,... ...don't leave him alone. Okay, I'll see. No, Suresh, take this matter seriously. - Be there at 10. - Okay. Okay, call me. Do one thing, lift him up. - Lift him. - Okay, dad. - Take him inside. - Okay. - Vicky, get up. - Careful. Vicky... Come here. Come. Careful. Are you fine? Okay? Come. This side... Careful. Hold his feet Look here The mouse opened the net Listen,... ...does it happen to kids this age too? Suresh, how would I know? Vikram Aswani? Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, I'll send him. - Come. - She called out so loudly... Just come. Ma'am, I've filled this form. Okay, ma'am. - Take the admission form inside... - Okay. - Fine. - How much, ma'am? 3,000 rupees, sir. Thank you, sir. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Yeah come in. This is the paper... Right. - How many of you? - Three. Right. Okay. Let's sit there. Come. Come. Please sit. I'm assuming this is Vikram. - Yes. - Yeah. Dr Kamlesh called me yesterday. And he told me everything he knew about the case. Can you please speak in Hindi? Sure. Vikram,... ...son, would you like to share something? Vicky, if you want to say something.... Kamlesh must've told you. Vicky is disturbed since some days. But yesterday things got out of hand. Mr. Suresh... - Huh? - Do you have anything to say? No,... ...what Anita said is right. He's hurt and should be fine. Well, his graduation exams are coming up... ...but we don't pressure him to study. If he doesn't take the exams,... ...it's fine. You tell us what to do. Vikram,... ...look son, if you want to share something,... ....you can do it. It's fine. Vicky. No problem, it's okay. Mr. Suresh, please wait outside with Vikram. I'd like to speak to Mrs Aswani in private Vicky... Okay, you stay. I'll wait outside. - Be with Vicky. - Yes. Anita,... ...how's Vikram's wound? It's still raw. It's deep so... It'll take time to heal. Right. I think you're not telling me everything. No, nothing like that. Ask me and I'll answer. Okay. What do you think? Vikram's behaviour... When and why did it change? What's the reason? I don't know the reason. Vicky was actually always... ...different. But after Udita's episode... ...he was... - Udita is his girlfriend? Was. I don't know the current status. He doesn't even share. Right. But Sagar said... ....he goes to the university but doesn't attend the classes. - Sagar? - My younger son. Right. He told us yesterday... ...he doesn't attend classes. Anita, how is Vikram's relationship with people at home? Can you tell me? - It's normal like everyone does. - Right. He used to keep to himself. Sagar on the phone... ...and Suresh is a bit... ...short tempered so with the kids... Didn't you ever stop him? It's not like that. I did stop him but... ...you see, ma'am,... ...where there's love there is some scolding too. Anita, how are you? Are you fine? How can I be? My son hurt his head. He set himself ablaze. He's so troubled and I don't know what's happening with him. How can I be fine? As for Suresh,... ...he's nice. Just like... ...a father should be.... ...and a husband should be. He's just like that. He's very nice but... I'm sorry I'm... I'm really sorry. Ma'am, please calm down. Whatever's happening with Vikram... ...trust me, with treatment and medicine... ...there's a chance he will recover completely. So don't worry. How will that happen? These black outs and self harm... ....are actually early signs of depression. But we can't rule out other things. For now, I'll prescribe some medicines. Give these at least for a month. Then... See me after a week, okay? And Anita, I have a request. No matter what happens,... ...don't leave Vikram alone in any room. If there's a lock in his room,... ...or some latch, remove it. The state he is in right now... ...he could take a big step without realising it. So, just be careful. But please don't be scared. This situation can be handled... ...just have faith and... ...don't cut corners with his treatment. The next appointment you... - ...or.. - Yes, the receptionist will help you. Thank you. Wow, mom. - Son, What are you doing? - Please say sorry to him now. - Saniya, you can go in. - Thank you, ma'am. Come. Let's continue... - That.. - Yes, I'll convey it. She said about an appointment. Yes, ma'am, next week. - And.. - Do we have to come again? - Keep this patient file carefully. - Okay. So what are the charges? 3,000 rupees? - What? - 3,000 rupees, sir. Isn't that too high? We'll talk at home. Just pay now. I'll call you and... - Yes, confirm it. - I'll fix the time. - Here. - Yeah. Get the receipt. I'll wait in the car. The tiger said I owe you for this Now I will be your friend forever So the mouse was very happy Fenugreek has become so expensive. How are you? I'm fine. Vicky? I gave him the medicines, he's asleep. Sagar? He must be on his way. He messaged me. Look, I think... ...we should stop these medicines. Why? What do you mean why? What all is she saying. Hide sharp things. Don't lock the doors. It's been a week anyway. You didn't even tell me what the doctor said. Not much, she said... She asked me about Vicky... ...as to how he was and is right now. What all he did and I told her.... ...what I thought. What all did you tell her? That he was always different from childhood. And after Udita's episode he's... ...more secluded... ...and didn't tell us what happened between them. What else? And that... ....she thinks... ....these are symptoms of depression. Depression is fine but what's the exact disease? What's ailing him? When will he be cured? She said if we don't pay attention then... ...he could attempt suicide. What? He could attempt suicide. Suicide? Anita, she's talking rubbish and you heed her. She will keep calling us... ...and we'll keep paying 3000 rupees. Huh? You suggest what should we do. If you have a solution we'll go for it. Suresh, please... ....let's follow what she's saying. Why take a risk with Vicky's life? I feel tired. May I sleep a while? Yes. Go. Listen, I've set an alarm. If I don't get up,... ....check on Vicky every hour. I'll go. Suresh? Suresh. Vicky is up. Please check on him. Okay. You're up. I'm going for a shower. Listen, don't lock the door. Did you hear me? I was just checking. Don't lock it. You can answer the door once in a while Anju, you're late. Please make 'poha'. - Okay. - And milk too... Look at the milk. Careful. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! - What happened? - I don't know. The door was open 2 minutes ago. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky, open the door. Vicky! Vicky! What have you done? - Vicky! - Stop staring, do something. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! What are you doing? Vicky! Dad.... Vikram, if you don't wish to talk, you may go. There's no pressure. Okay tell me... ...do you have a favourite activity? Anything that you enjoy doing? It could be singing, dancing... ...or gymming. Anything. By the way,... ...your mom thinks you're still lamenting your ex-girlfriend. But ... ...I didn't believe her. - Why? - Why? Well, only if a person tells me... ...how they're feeling, only then do I believe it. So I'll believe ... ...what you tell me. Okay, tell me,... ...is there anything from your past,... ....that makes you happy? Any memory or a moment... ....that still makes you happy. Relax, it's a... It's between the two of us. You can trust me. I... ...in junior college (High School)... I used to dance. It was good. Only good? In the inter-university... ...I won a trophy. The judge said... ...I was the only one who was feeling it. That felt good. How good? I'm sure a lot. Maybe that's why I still remember it. So you used to dance in college. Madam, he studies in a business course. We just told him... ...to focus on studies. And if he gets some free time, he can dance or do whatever Why do you like dancing? I like it because... ...I feel free. That means... ....when you don't dance... ...then you don't feel free? Vicky was always an introvert. He'd share things with me sometimes. But with his dad... He never really... Anyway,... ...what is it that you want to feel free from? From everything.... ...to everyone... ...telling me what to do what not to do... ...what is right and what is wrong. Everything. Then why don't you dance? What's stopping you? I never coerced him. But if your child does something.... ....that will ruin his future,... ....shouldn't I stop him as a father? Tell me one thing,... ...when you harm yourself,... ...what goes on in your mind? Sometimes I feel,... ....I'm locked in a cage. I'm trapped. Okay. So, .... ....what's outside the cage? We thought it's nothing. And I told you about Udita too. Udita is a nice girl. Suresh and I like her. In fact, she belongs to our caste. Well, it wouldn't matter if she didn't. I tried talking to her. I do sometimes. Is there a way... ...to get out of this cage? My ways might be wrong,... ....but my intent is that of a father. Does anyone at home force you... ...to do something you don't want to? I told him many times... ...to patch up with Udita. I tried talking to Udita too. But Vicky's behaviour upset her so badly.... Then I stopped. Is this because of your break up? What I actually wonder is... ...how I landed in that cage. Okay... ...tell me about your family, Vikram. I don't recall anything specific. But... ...things were normal earlier. Vicky was always a sensitive child. So, he needed a lot of love and support... ...to come this far. Wonder... ...how all this... Any favourite memory with your dad? Once I... ...went out after class. All my friends were there. They were smoking. I don't smoke. But ... ...my phone was on silent. My dad was calling me. I couldn't answer. He came there looking for me.... ...and in front of everyone... ...he slapped me. What do you think? Madam, I... ...was born in a village. Current trends are beyond me. So, I make mistakes at times. My father raised me by whacking me Hence, I reached this far in life. Tell me about your mom. What could be the reason behind your dad's behaviour? Mom is a child. She's very sweet. Yes, she's scared of dad. And your younger brother? Sagar (Ocean) is like his name... He's happy in his world. Look,... ....for now, please let him rest. And don't force him for anything. If possible, keep things normal. And... ....don't bring any change deliberately. Don't give him instructions. Should I make him prepare for the exams or not? If Vikram wants to take his exams, he'll do it. Don't take decisions on his behalf. I'll prescribe some medicines. These are anti depressants. I've increased the dose. This should help. Your medicines make me feel better... ...perhaps that's why I shared all this. But... ...my body... ....feels uneasy. Gassy type. Look, don't worry. I'll reduce the dose in a few days. But you have to promise, Vikram,... ....you will have medicines on time. Okay? Good. Vicky? 2 minutes. Listen, how's the new driver Dilip? Yes, Vicky said he's nice. Anju, make a 'paratha' without oil please. Yes, madam. And pack for Vicky too. Vicky, you took so long. It's 9.30. Your paper is at 10. Hurry up. You have to take medicines too. Sir, 'paratha'? - Without oil? - Today... - ..which paper is it? - Yes. Eco. All the best. After the exam,... ....you'll get holidays. Come to the shop. Suresh, we'll discuss that later. He has a paper today. I'm talking about later. 'Paratha'? Son, have your medicine. Quick. I've packed a 'paratha'. Have it in the car. The paper will take 3 hours, you'll get hungry. What happened? You okay? - I gulped water - It's okay. Come. Here, all the best. Once you finish the exam, call me. Okay? - Wish him luck. - Come to the shop. All the best. Bye, Vicky. - You're too much! - What happened? He has an exam and you're talking about the shop! - What is the harm in talking about it - Yeah right. Bro... Bro... Vikram... Bro. Sir! Sir, he... Sir.... Sir... Sir... Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! What happened? Vicky! Are you okay, Vicky? Vicky, stop. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky, you'll fall. Vicky, you okay? Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! What you're saying is right. But my stomach is bloating because of your medicines. So you admit you didn't take the tablets, Vikram? Now that your exams are over,... ....what's your plan? The exams aren't over. I'll have to wait another year to take exams. Mom and dad are scared.... ...lest I run away.... ....more so after the incident in college. Dad has a plan ready.... ...to make me a shopkeeper in his shop. Son, what's your plan? What do you want to do? I... I want to be freed of this. And from you too. Okay. Any idea how you'll do that? I have many ideas... ....but they all fail. And these medicines you gave... ...don't bring out ideas but my stomach! Vikram, you like dancing, right? Yes, I mean... ...the judge, the one who... ...praised me... ....offered me a scholarship... ...in his academy. That was great fun. Then... ....I started paying fees. Then dad stopped paying suddenly. - You know that. - This... What type of classes were those? They were of long duration. Robert sir's classes. Modern dance.... ....with live musicians. He thinks of himself as an American choreographer. I still feel like going there. But dad won't pay the fees. So, I can't go. Should I speak to your parents if you don't mind? If you tell them, they'll think I asked you to. I will get taunted anyway. Trust me,... ...nothing like that will happen. Just promise me, you'll take your medicines on time. And if you dance, you'll feel good. And your stomach will go in too. Deal? Good Boy Are you enjoying this? Excuse Me Please It's strange. First move to the left Hey, can you pass me the bottle.

That was awesome, guys. That's great. Good job. But of course.... ....there is one thing that we have to do in every class. That is... ....improvise. Or like my wife from UP calls it in Hindi... ...'upaj' (improvise). Like they say,... ...'When you improvise you hear the voice of your mind and understand the language of the heart'. 'And Upaj comes with some pain, like fire and water'. - Wow. - Thank you. Thank you. Are you praising me or... I can't say! Okay. No problem. But on a serious note,... life isn't always choreographed, guys. Or the way you want it to be. So, let's not forget to hear ourselves. And most importantly,... ...to know ourselves. There is rhythm going on in our lives. Right? So let's not forget to dance.... ...on the rhythm of life. - Okay? - Yes, sir. Okay, great. - All right, Sherry? - Yes.

You were too good! I've never played so much improv music before! Sherry, by the way. Oh sorry. That was an 'upaj' of a handshake. Robert sir tends to linger on the mind. So, may I ask something if you don't mind? I don't get offended so soon. What do you want to know? If you can't see,... ....how did you know I did well? I mean,... ...you're terribly mistaken that... ...only you have the super power of feelings. I'll help you to the door? Oh!!! Well, what good is a door? I feel like having a Frappuccino. Care to join me? Sure I mean... ....I've to drop Robert sir. I'll tell you something. Robert sir takes too long to change. We can have 4 Frappuccinos by then. You tell me if you'll have it. - Interested? - I mean... It's close by, not in Goa. Don't be so serious. Come. Interested? - Okay. - Then let's go. Come, I'll help you to the door. Come. Your Frappuccino. Oh, finally! - There's a straw. - Thanks. You turned out to be a fitness freak. - Meaning? - I mean,... ...who has green tea in a cafeteria? - After such a great day! - Well,... - ...my stomach is full. - I see. Oh this is so good. Just look,... Tell me how my drink is. How does it look to be precise? It's long and creamy. What? That's a horrible description. - Did you learn that or are you gifted that ways? - No, I... - Sorry. - What? I'm not that good with words. Because you're a dancer. You express through dance. Is that right? Perhaps. May I ask a question? Yes. How do you look? Me? I... How can I explain? Normal only. Do one thing... ...take my phone. And take our selfie. Take 3-4 pictures. Maybe 7-8. You never know... ....where my eyes will be shut. Here. Take it, be quick. Open the camera. Tell me.... ....when you're clicking. Ah... Done? - Yeah. - Did you smile? - What? - Let's take one more. Okay. Say 'paneer'. Okay? Then I'll get confirmation. 'Paneer'. Awesome, give it. If you don't mind, can I ask you something? Yes go on. If you can't see,... ...how do you use a phone? Well, there's an app for blind people. We know the command for any button we press. It's not a big deal. Big deal is... ...Sherry! Like what! Anyway, give me your Instagram username. I'm not on Instagram. C'mon, Vikram. I mean, I am but I don't use it much. Then you must use it. Anyway, give me your id. Vick99. 99! Any precise reason for 99? Run out, bowled over? - Like what? - No that's... That's just my birth year. Huh. Not bad. Anyway,... ...I posted the picture with you. And I've written this is Vikram Aswani, aka Vicky. How does he look? Now we'll both know... ...how you look, Vick99. Okay,... ...time to use my sixth sense to the fullest because.... ...you know about the fifth. - Meaning? - I mean, washroom. I'll help you. - It's fine. - Okay. It's all right, you can pick it up. I may have to go. I'll... I'll cover your drink. - Robert sir! - Yeah. He always come so early no. - Okay fine. - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay, cool. - Okay. - Sorry. - It's all right. See you, Vick99. - Hello. - Hello, Vicky. - I was fed up looking for your number. Got it from the Admissions register - Yes, sir. - You were to drop me, right? - Yes, sir. - I'm out. Where are you? - Yes, sir. We have an annual recital in the college.... ...within three months. Usually, only yearly students perform. But I want you for that. I think you'll be good on stage. Sir, but I haven't stepped on stage in years. So what? Eagles never fear soaring. They course through the winds disregarding the sky. You can do it man. You know all are preparing their choreography. I feel we should try something different. You know something new. And we have Sherry. She will compose new music for us. Yes, sir. Sherry is nice. Yeah man. She's also a very good singer. - Really? - Yeah, she's a... ...regular concert performer. She comes to my academy... ...because we provide her with space for her... ...personal rehearsals and all. She's also doing her MA in music. Mister, please stop here. All right man, then I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow? I think you should come Monday to Friday. I want you for the recital. Please, sir, can I... ...message you and revert? It better be yes, okay? Fine, cool. Do come, it'll be fun. And you were good today. Thanks for the lift. Bye. Sagar, how are you? Yohan! I'm fine. Why are you in the university? You finished your graduation. Well, my parents said... ...I should do my masters. Tell me, doesn't Vicky use his phone? He's not active on Insta either. No, he does when mom insists. He goes to classes. Class? Which ones? He goes to some dance class since 2-3 months. Finally, he's continuing something. I thought he'll ruin his life for Udita. Did he dance earlier as well? Yes, didn't you know? What? Your brother was the star of junior college. - Vicky? - Yes, Vicky. But he never told me. But he knew everything about you. - Me? - Yes, you. What do you think? Juniors don't face ragging? - Yes. - Your brother earned great respect. You're Vikram's brother, so... ...nobody messed with you. Please return the book on time. Forget all that,... ...tell him to call me when he feels better. What are you listening to? Numb by Linkin Park. Interested? Why such an old song today? It's on the university's live radio. It's World Suicide Prevention Day. So, how's that connected to this? Linkin Park's singer Chester Bennington... - ...had committed suicide. - What? Yes, that's shocking. Artists have so much talent... ...yet they go into depression. They commit suicide. He was young! I'll come back in some time. 'Dard Hai Toh Dance Hai' - 'TV - Where there is pain there is dance' - Where have you reached? Okay, come soon. Bye. What happened? He's close by. The doctor's expenses have increased. And people from our colony are acting strange too. Your son has made us famous. Anyway, at least tell him... ...to come to the shop. Don't you have any other topic? Why? What other topic do you want? Things are just starting to get normal. Why don't you get that? Have you seen this show? 'Where there is pain, there is dance' Why doesn't he come on this show if he's so talented? At least we will get famous for a good reason. This show? Do you know these kids come with recommendation? Really? This guy? This vegetable vendor's son? Who would recommend him? The sweeper of the show? No, what's the connection? I don't get it. The connection is that he uses dance as an excuse. Why are you after him? TV - I just want the audiences to Vote for me TV - & I will work hard TV - Don't cry Ashish. Our judges can change your fate Vicky! - Vicky.... - And that's a 10. - Vicky. - Yeah. How was your day? - It was good. - Good? - I'll take a shower. - Shower later. Dinner is ready. Freshen up and we'll eat. Okay. Sagar! Can't you brothers coordinate? Mom, I came from the university. - Yes, he just came in. - I see. Go freshen up. - Okay. - I'll set the table. - Do that. - You also come please. Vicky - Vicky. - Yes. What happend? Nothing. What are you doing here? I just came from the university. Listen, mom said we'll dine together. So you're coming... No, you carry on. I'll eat later. Okay, cool. - Sagar. - Yes, Vicky. Do one thing,... ...get our food here. - We'll eat together. - Okay. - We haven't caught up in a while. - Right. Okay, I'll get it. Mom, serve me and Vicky. He's taking your medicines since two months and things were fine. He was dancing. But since a week he's again... Is he taking the medicines on time? Yes, I'm regular with medicines. Anita, did something happen in the last 6-7 days... ...that upset him? Some fight or argument at home? What? Suresh, when we were talking that day... ...and you said he's using dance as an excuse... ...to avoid doing anything else. So? Vicky heard that, ma'am. Mr. Suresh, do you think what you did was right? Madam, I thought he's getting better... ...so it's the right time, I mean... ...he does nothing. Doesn't even go to the university. Don't you think you should give your son some more time? Time? Why? What for? So he can take his decisions, sir. Madam, he's not taking any decisions. That's exactly the problem. We're doing everything you said. We gave medicines like you said. We let him dance as you said. But that's not how practical life works. And its not like you are offering any permanent solution. Mr. Suresh, Vikram has to find the solution... ...not you or me. We're just helpers in his life. Help? Now... ...what does that mean? Sir, I'll share some files of Vikram today. These are his reports. We record our conversations... ..and analyse it. There's nothing secretive about it. You can read it and share it with Vikram too... ...if you like. These are just evaluations of our conversations... ...and not some final proof or document. We feel Vikram is lazy... ....because he gets things on a platter. Madam, we know that already. All thanks to her pampering. But Vikram has a high IQ. Hence, anything... ...that doesn't use his intelligence entirely... ...bores him. And we feel... ...he likes dancing... ...because his entire intelligence gets utilised. Madam, how do we believe you? Sir, this analysis was made after hearing him out. I haven't written this off my mind. Believing it or not... ...is up to you, sir. So you mean to say, if he keeps dancing, he'll be fine? Look Anita, there was no incident in the last three months. So maybe it's safe to say that dancing is... ...reducing his mood swings. Anita, it could be her medicines at play. Suresh,... ...I read a paper on neuroscience some years ago. It said, people... ...who like performing arts... ...like dancing, singing, drama... The reason could be that in their childhood... ...nobody understood their needs. So, they happen to value themselves... - ...as per other's opinons. - Great! Finally, we're the villains. Sir, please. Don't take me wrong. I understand... ....what you and Mrs Aswani are going through. But call it a generation gap or something else.... ....I'm just trying to help you... ...understand your son. We will understand him, ma'am. We won't put any pressure on him. We anyway don't pressurise him. I mean, you're saying we should heed you. What's the guarantee things will improve? What will we do if they don't? Sir, I'm giving you a suggestion... ...not a solution. The ball is in your court. Two months. After that he has to do some work, okay? Mr. Suresh, I will say one thing though. Sometimes what you see... ...that's just one side of the story. What are you trying to say? Let me show you. What do you see, sir? It's an apple. What kind of apple? Just like any red apple. Now? Listen, you... ... go to the car. How much? 3,000, right? - Yes, sir. - Shall we? Here. And we'll do that nicely and... What's up? - Hi, Sherry. - Hey, Reshma, how are you? - Good. - Hey, Vicky! How? I mean... Don't help me walk around. Help me in cafes. Where were you since a week? Wasn't that well. You mean spiritually, mentally or physically? You never know these days. Not sure about physically but... ....confused between... ...mentally and spiritually. Look, my music will heal you spiritually. You needn't go anywhere else. I can't say anything about mentally. For that, you... ...have to wait for Robert sir. Can you? Okay, I'll see you. Enjoy your mental class, sorry! Enjoy Robert sir's class. - Hey, Vicky! - Hi, sir. Where were you? Sorry, I was busy. You didn't answer the phone. You could've at least messaged. Sorry about that, sir. Anyways, we'll talk after the class. You've got loads to learn. The show is in a month. No, sir. It's okay. Meaning? Sir, I don't think I am... ...prepared to go on stage. Don't be stupid. You're awesome, dude. You worry for nothing. We'll talk after the class, okay? Go back. All right guys,... ...come. Get up everyone. We have to do the same thing we did in the last class. Yes, sir. We have to polish what we learnt earlier.... - ...because the show is in just a month. - Yes, sir. All right. So let's start. - Yes, sir. - Okay. Good job. So it was a great session. Good job, guys. Okay,... ...unfortunately we have less time today for 'upaj'.... ....because I have a meeting. - But this was a good session. - Thank you, sir. Also, please don't miss the Saturday and Sunday classes because... ...the show is very close. - Okay? - Yes, sir. Good. All right. Before we leave, a few poetic lines. - No, No! - They're nice. - Wait. - Go ahead. Listen to this one. I'm talking about your good. Okay? - Here I go. - Go on. 'It's both present and absent in your entity.' 'It's both present and absent in your entity.' 'Find it within and bring the absent back to life.' 'Beyond all limitations'... ...'bring forth yourself into the limitless'. 'Don't cage yourself within for you're the sky'. 'Don't cage yourself within for you're the sky'. 'The world will watch you as you soar anew'. Wow. Thank you so much, guys. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. - All right. - Let's go. Let's go together. What a great class! Hey, you have a minute? Sir, I'm really sorry about today. It's okay, man. It happens. Besides you were absent for many days. - Sir.... - But, all okay? I mean, sort of. If you don't wish to share, it's fine. It's okay. No, sir, it's not like that. Well, I don't know how to say it. No problem. Well,... ...let's change and meet outside. You drop me on the way? - Okay? - Sure, sir. Cool. Oh! I have a staff meeting. Can you wait for half hour? - Sure, sir. I can wait for half an hour. - Yeah? So you chill and we'll catch up outside? Cool, see you. You can tell me what you think of it. It was nice. Well, I mean thank you but... ...I'm just confused about this song. I mean, I'm trying to think of a title for it. But nothing's coming to mind. Can you help me? I want a name for this. Something that should just connect you know. Will you help? How about.... ...something on the lines of free? Something like... ...'mukt'? 'Mukt'? Wow! You mean, liberated... ...free... I'm in the right zone, right? Something like that. Well, I think... ...perhaps you seek freedom from something. What? I'm kidding, okay? Don't take everything I say seriously. It's good to have you back. So, no extra rehearsals tonight? There were extra rehearsals but... ...I'm 'mukt' now. Liberated. I mean, I'm free now. Can I drop you home? Just because I'm blind, you don't have to drop me home early. Don't watch too many Bollywood films. Days or nights make no difference to us. It's all the same so it's fine. Well, where are you going? Nowhere for now. I've to drop Robert sir at staff quarters so... You've become Robert sir's chauffeur. But he'll take some time to come so... ...you can help a blind woman home! - You can do that much. - Yes. - Yeah sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yeah. - Won't you ask where I live? - Where? - Where do you live? - Hostel.... Yes, I live in the hostel. So, you remembered. I'm so proud of you, Vicky. Oh sorry, I left my umbrella. - Yeah. - Help me out. To the left. No, you hold it. I'll hold your hand. You know the way to the hostel, right? Where did you learn to play the piano? Well, timing! My grandpa taught me. Want to know how a piano is made? I can tell you! So, you saw him... So sorry,... ...you heard him and got inspired? Actually when I was born, I could see. By the time I was 5, my vision was totally gone. When I started losing my vision, grandpa was playing something on the piano... ...and I began smiling and then whenever grandpa... ...played I smiled, that's what my parents tell me. My parents told me to sit with grandpa and I did. That's how I started learning piano. I just kept learning and learning, in fact... ...my grandpa still teaches me. Care to listen to this thrilling mysterious saga again? Nice. Thank you. I think I'd really like to meet him. Sorry, it's not possible, I wish though. Why? I mean he... ...passed away a couple of years ago but... ...you know he's one of the only people I remember seeing clearly. I mean, his weirdly cute beard... ...his animated series whenever he used to teach me, I... ...absolutely love him but... ...I can pretty much see him whenever I want to actually. So, isn't that a super power? But I'm really sorry. Wait, left from here. Don't say sorry. You got a chance to come to the girls' hostel thanks to me. Convert your sorry into thank you! - Excuse me, ma'am... - Just a minute. - What? - He's here to drop me, so he'll go. Just drop here quickly. Don't wait. Okay, thank you. - Tell me. - There's a step. Don't worry... ...listen to me. You said something else... Look around, tell me if you like someone around. I know everyone. Not really looking for anyone. Oh! You're one who is not looking and then there is me who can't look! You know, I'm anyway scared... Scared? You? Yes, imagine! I can't see who is there or who is not.... ....especially during intercourse. How will I know who it is... ....given all the excitement. I was kidding, Vikram! Keep walking. Okay. All right, so... So, where was your school? I mean, which school? I was from New Era... Watch your step. Don't worry. Hey, Sherry! - Shivani! - Clothes for laundry? Let me take them off first. C'mon! Here we are. Can you see, Vikram? Oops sorry, Vicky. You know I rarely switch on the lights of my room. Only for blind dates. Sit. Oh crap. Sorry. Messy, Clumsy Sherry. Here. Do you mind... Please pull the curtains. Privacy is an issue here. Here.... So, do you play piano here? I chop vegetables here. Interested? Carrots, tomatoes, cucumber... Obviously! Piano... Oh by the way,... ...this is my grandfather's piano. I spoke about it outside. - Oh! - Yeah. Nice. Want to hear something? Yeah, I mean sure. Okay. What should I play for Vick99... Oh! This is a very special song. Let me figure out the cords. D, F, E...Okay. Okay. ''Fragrance stolen from you''... ...''make my seasons delectable'' ''What state is my heart in?'' ''Ask me, my beloved'' ''You dance rhythmically to my heart's tunes'' ''Your style is amazing!'' ''Come close to me'' ''Let me see you by touching you'' ''In these wet seasons''... ...''your arms beckon me'' ''What brings me closer to myself''... ...''is your voice'' ''In these wet seasons your arms beckon me'' ''Come close to me'' ''Let me see you by touching you'' 'Innocent heart, what's with you?' 'What's the cure to this ailment?' - I forgot the bag. - Exactly. Thankfully I was there. So? You were going to say something. Sir, I know there's some problem. What problem? I don't know the details. But ... ...I have to take medicines. Dr Neeta Upadhyay's clinic? You consult Dr Neeta? Yes, ... Do you know her? Yes.. No. - I've heard about her. - Where? I mean, I've seen her. She's also a consultant at the university. So I think I saw her there. So, she gave me this file. My parents forgot it in the car. Okay. Do you mind if I take this file with me? You know just to read. Sir, if possible... ...keep it to yourself. Dad might not like it. Of course man. Of course, stays with me. All right, I'll see you. Yes, I have a really nice restaurant in mind. I'll confirm. Okay, Sarika... ...I'm going to call you later. Robert has just come home. Okay, bye. Rob! You can at least shut the door. How lazy! How was your day? Interesting. Confusing and weird. Okay, what happened? Neeta, sit for a minute please. Robert, what's the suspense about? What happened? You have a patient Vikram. He comes to my class. You never told me about it. Robert, you know why. Then why do you ask? Yeah, patient confidentiality. Ethics code and stuff. But I'm your husband, right? So? How does that matter? Consider it a co-incidence. I read his file by the way. That's great. It depends on Vikram who he shares his file with. Good you read his file. And I think he doesn't need medicines... ...but therapy. And dance is his therapy. And it is just a co-incidence that he's brilliant at it. Rob, look,... ...I did what I thought would help my patient. You do what you think is right. But I need to tell you, this is a very sensitive case. So, let the experts also handle it. You think I'm just a dumb dance teacher. - Huh? - What? What are you saying? When did I say that? Why are you putting words in my mouth? And why are we discussing work at home? I'll heat the food. Stop doing this poker face thing with me, all right! I'm not your patient. Robert, what does that mean? Rob! What does this mean? Your file says... ...dance has helped him in getting better. Now you're saying leave it to the experts! Rob, your job is to give dance lessons.... ...not be a psychiatrist. That's my job. And I have never disrespected your job. And my job makes artists out of students. We make them realise their true potential. And I don't give medicines for that. Rob, now you're crossing a line. I'm just stating the truth. That's your ego speaking not you. What has my ego got to do with this? - You know what? - What ego? I'm done having this conversation. I'm not talking... What you can't take this huh? You can't take this? I'm less educated than you and I'm being able to help this guy better than you. - And you can't take this. - It is not about us. It is about him. It doesn't matter who's helping him... ...as long as he's getting help. If you've read his report,... ....you'd understand the root of the problem is his father's ego! That has spoilt the ambiance at home. But why will you understand, Robert? Patriarchy exists here as well! Heat the food and sleep in the other room. I lost my appetite because of your ego crap. ''Celestial''... ''Celestial''... ''Celestial''... ...''bird!''

Okay, come. Suresh, Vicky will be here soon. This is all because of your Vicky. - What's wrong with you? - Understood? Suresh, please... He doesn't want to work. What's wrong? He just wants to live off his father's money. What's this? These are tickets to Vikram's show. We'll go, right? What's happening to us? Everything's fine, Suresh. What's fine? - Things are getting better now. - What? - How? - Suresh,... Are you fine? I'm fine? I feel alone. Don't say that, Suresh, please. Why do you feel like that? You know,... ...I often feel I'd rather die than live like this. Suresh please! Please. Suresh, Vicky's here. He'll be upset to see you like this. - What happened, mom? - Nothing, son. How were the rehearsals? - Great. - Is it? I called but your phone is switched off. Yes, sorry. I left it in the car. Get it. I'll take your bag. Ask Dilip to come early tomorrow. He's late everyday. Mom! - Mom. - Yes? - Where are you? - Coming. Coming. So, you said the rehearsals were great. - Yes. What happened? - Nothing. I'm excited about the show tomorrow. Right? So, we'll come tomorrow. Dad too? Of course, son, dad will come too. All will come. You have a show. That calls for a celebration. Let's have ice cream. I ceem! Come. Vicky, you've grown so thin. Sagar, is that Udita? That one in red. It is Udita. Hope there won't be a problem. Nothing will happen, mom. It's a public show, anybody can come. - How do my earrings look? - They're very pretty. So different! Vicky, can you just drop her? I've to get ready. - Okay. - Vicky! Hey, you seem nervous. You seem great at sensing things. Obviously! You don't need eyes for that. - Can I give you an advice? - Tell me. When you first came to the studio, what did you think during 'upaj'? Nothing much just... It was just me and... - ...your music. - Of course my music. No, ... Do that today as well. Don't think about anything Just listen to my music. Ya? - Ready? - I guess. Guess again! - - All the best. - I will be. Yes. - Thank you. See you. And... ...one more thing. Vicky, ... ...this stage is a special place. We artists get a chance to show our world here. If the audience likes it or not that's not our problem. There's no better chance than this, Vicky. Make sure you live it, yeah? - Okay. - All the best. - Bye. - Sherry, come in. I'll help. Looking gorgeous today. Shouldn't you be backstage? They are ready. I'll watch the show with you today. Was it necessary for me to come? It wasn't necessary for you... ....but it is for others. Hello, Vicky, we are all here. Good, thanks. And do well and listen... ...it's time for your medicines. Please have it. - Or you'll forget later. - Yeah. I'll just take it Listen, all the best. Sagar has wished you too. Dad too. Say thanks to Sagar. The show will begin soon. Good luck. See you after the show. - Bye. - Thanks, mom. Listen,... ...Dr Neeta's here too. Look. Don't go and talk to her. Or I'll have to pay 3000 bucks for no reason! Your student Vikram's family is here too. Really? Where? - Welcome ladies and gentlemen. - I can't point... - They are at the back. - We welcome you all.... ...to Indore University's performing arts recital.... - ...called 'Expressions'. - I think... ...I know them. Through this show, we present students... ...with a stage... ...to express something new.... ...and present their talent before you. Today we'll see performances by talented students... ...of the music, theater and dance department. Please switch off your phones during the show... ...or keep them on silent mode.
