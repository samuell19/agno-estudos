Action. Jilling off. What is it? What does it mean? We need financial support to sustain our mission of creating the greatest female orgasm there ever was, so we can heal the Earth. We hope that you will join us, and we will become one. Come into our Womb Room. Come to us. Come with your money. Just come. Welcome to Jilling Off. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Relax the sit bones. Focus on the tail. The tail is your breath. Your breath is the tail. You and the tail are one. It's always been there. In this elixir, we find strength. In this elixir, we find the essence of the divine feminine. It unfolds. From the void manifest. From the void, we find strength. Close your eyes. It flows the rope. It flows the tail. It flows the blood. It flows the clit. The ritual has begun! Send that rope where the tail cannot go, through the crust of the Earth into the core. Deeper. Deeper. Into the core. Down. The top of your head, shoulders, back... Chest out. Breath of Dragon. Embrace the blood as it flows. The blood as it flows through the walls of the womb. Engage the hips. The walls that feel the mother within. The mother, the core, the giving poor mother... Mother. Earth. Mother. Earth. Mother. Earth. Women face outward. Men prepare. See the core within her. Feel those lips engage. - Um... - Sardines. - Oh nice. Uh... - Yeah. I'll try one. I'll try it. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'll just... I'll just start with this piece. Yeah, yeah cool. I mean, you can eat the whole thing, bones and all. - Sorry. - Oh. And the napkins... they're... I use them over and over, but they're clean. Oh. Okay. Thanks. What's your name? I'm Erica. Here. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Where are you from again? I'm from Florida, originally. What part? Miami. Ah. I got a job up here for this new start-up. You know, like a wellness group. That sounds like full-on... - out there... - Yeah. But I kinda have this philosophy, like, don't trust anyone for sure. Oh. Yeah, I'm a little... Just a... Little more... I'm gonna see how the summer goes, and then I might adopt that view. Everyone sucks. Period. Yeah. Do you want anymore? Because I'm gonna... Uh... - No. - I mean, uh... - No thanks, yeah. - Okay. You can... I'm just... Hey. The mechanics gave us hot dogs. Oh. You want it? Yeah. Thanks. Cheers. I'm gonna hold off on mine. Like, go... go nuts. You know, it's weird being adopted and not knowing your origin. Maybe Earth is, like... a stepping stone. And I'm not trying to toot my own horn, like I'm special, but maybe I'm meant for something bigger, and I'm waiting. I'm down. You take capitalism, you know, and like, like, climate change, and, like, rape culture. It's, like, the same disregard for the feminine. You know, plant a flag. Fill your car up with a penis to get the gas in there. That's ejaculate to me. That's just... economic ejaculate. And I'm just sick of that ejaculate right now. That's where I'm at. That's where I'm coming from. You know, I have no idea what Peggy sees in me. I mean, objectively, logically, she probably needed an IT guy. And I'm kinda... I'm the tech... Kind of a tech... Wouldn't say expert, but I'm... tech savvy. I've been consumed by men for a lot of my life. Peggy helped me access a part of myself I really, truly don't know how long it would have taken me to find. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I've walked away from everything to be part of the Jilling Off team. Open! I'm helping... Open! the proverbial vagina lubricate itself. The run. The run. I'm being of service here. The work we're doing up here this is the fringe of self help. Obviously we're on the fringes, but you gotta start somewhere. Oh who's this? Who's this? I don't know which... Alright, nice to meet you! Two got off. One of 'em's ours. That's her. Hi! Erica? - Hi. - Yes? - Hello! - Welcome. - Hey! - Hey! - Hi! - Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you. - I'm Asia. We got you a hot dog, so... Thank you. - Thanks. - Cheers. Hot dog cheers. Hi. - Uh... - Mm! I made you a mixtape. Um, your hands are full, but you listen to that later. - Thank you so much! - Welcome home. All aboard! I'm sure you're pretty tired, so let's get you to Peggy. - Thank you! - Go ahead first, okay? Okay. Oh! Hey Erica, you want to make sure you look out the window 'cuz we got a beautiful view coming up. Okay, I will. I will. Action. My name is Peggy Appleyard, and I am... an energy transformationist. You don't have a twelve hour orgasm and then not think that you're a channel for something. You don't access pleasure that expansive and... and just go about your day. The most important thing is we are... united in a commitment to female pleasure. And this means, masculine pleasure must enter from a place of giving. Masculine experience is now the giver, and the feminine energies must now receive. Truly, without guilt, without shame, without repression, without exploitation. I love how it's, like, steps up. Like, you can just climb on the whole thing. The water feels so warm. - It's not that cold. - Yeah, it isn't as cold. I really wanted to climb all the way to to top. Being here? Yeah, I feel like being here we're kind of removed from time. Like, we're just... everything's standing still. - And that's pretty cool. - Yeah. It's like a different frequency. - Oh. - Hey! - Hey New Girl. What's up? - HI! - Did you get your room now? - Yeah. - Nina showed it to me. - Cool. So... - Looking for - Ah. Tan mans. So uh... How do you like your room? It's nice! It's a serene... It's pretty. It has this nice, uh, candelabra in there, so... How old are you by the way? I'm twenty nine. Okay. As an older woman in this house, I wanted to give you some advice. Okay? - A secret, okay? - Okay. Don't be nervous. Am I scaring you? No! No, no, no, no. - No. - You're fidgeting, so... Uh, no, no, I... I'm just, uh... You should be more afraid of the men in this house. Okay? Um, they haven't ejaculated in a long time, and uh, they've got sperm built up in their gonads. So... Um... don't let them, because they're weak, and you're strong, okay? You're strong, and you're beautiful. - Thank you. Mhm. - Okay? I want you to watch out, okay? Yeah. - I mean it though, okay? - Okay. Really want you to watch out. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Just don't want to see anything happen to you, okay? Okay? Is that... it that water? - Yes. - Can I have some? Thank you. Aw man, I'm sorry. I drank it all. Well, gotta be going. Gotta... look for my glasses. Can't find them anywhere. Okay. I'll see you later, Asia. You don't have to succeed at everything every single day, but we can plan to plan to succeed in the things that we do. My feminine energy has been repressed, suppressed for so long. We're already coming from so far behind. Feminine energy comes from a place of setback. It comes forth from a place of setback. It is born from a place of setback, and that is where it triumphs. That fact that we got even here, we even got a map out. That's amazing to me! - We have two of them. - See the map? - Khan was talking about... - We have two of them. - zones. - Zones. Who can look at that map, and draw a circle around Zone 1? Someone who knows how to read a map? - I-I... - Zone 1 though. You know, before we enter the Zones, I'd like to take a minute to introduce our eighth. Seekers, please welcome Erica. Erica! - I have a question! - Erica, Erica, Erica... I have a question. How do you spell your name? C or K? C or K? - Uh, with a C. - Interesting. Ready? I would just say it's interesting. It's soft and hard. Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Sure, uh, so, my name is Erica, with a C. And I... Um... It's okay. Are you gassy? Are you alright? My name is... Oh, oh dear... Oh my God! - What? I didn't do anything! - Are you okay? You get her water. I'm gonna bring this upstairs, and we're gonna... - We need another map. - I have another map. I'm so sorry. It's alright! It's just a natural thing that happens. It's the gas station hot dogs. It's alright. I'm so sorry, guys. Honey, it's okay. Thank you. Yeah? Yeah. We're here for you. We are. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. I can still see you. I can see you through my hood. My hood is open. My eyes open. Your eyes open. The nerve endings are with us. Open your sacral chakra. Open for that sunset. Open! Breathe into those nerve endings. Keep that energy in your floor. Keep that bridge pulsing. Feel... the elixir. Open your sacral chakra. Open! With that sunset. Open! Breathe into those nerve endings. Feel the nerve endings alight. Widen those hips. Relax. And now find your partners and prepare. Focus! And turn away from the circle toward the light. Lip to lip. Listening, relisten. Moist is our choice. Mm... Oh yeah, uh, the sex people? Listen, if you want to do whatever you want with sex, do whatever you want. But don't do it to me, you know? I don't like that stuff. You know, people come by kissing me on the mouth. I got aunts that kiss me on the mouth. You know, my aunt Regina, she'll kiss ya down your neck, if you don't stop it. They're causing some commotion, and uh, I like that. They're doing their thing, and you know, I'm definitely cool with it. I think it's awesome. And the fact that they're keeping to themselves is what makes me nervous personally. I... I think it's because they don't know any of us. But we don't know them! And they're in our town. I, like, you know, we were here first. I seen the, um, woman who runs that thing. She's kinda weird. I think she's hot. You think she's hot? - Yeah. - Okay. The big question for me is... is anything that they're doing gonna cause them personal liability? Because that's... that's my area of expertise That's how I could help. It's scary because you think, "Am I the old cheese?" you know? You just... "cheese that's just gonna get shoved off the plate into the garbage" and somebody new and disco-y is gonna come here, and... and these people are, like, full of all of this libido. And also, parcels. They're parcel people. So right away. I mean there's always rumors, but I don't put too much credibility in rumors. A town this size, like, you see all the same people all the time. I don't know. I'm interested to meet them. I think those people in that house. I think they're a bunch of perverts. You know, I think they take, uh, advantage. I think they see a cheap house. Nice piece of property. Beautiful town. This town's not made for people like that. Okay I... I just have to say this. Um... I feel sick. So last night, it was really beautiful, but while I was, um, giving oral pleasure to Nina, I could feel my pelvic region on the ground, and um, as she climaxed, I, uh, I had a male orgasm. And I just... I'm sorry. I know... that was the womb room. That's not who I am. Oh, uh... The men, we don't... we don't ejaculate here. It wasn't... that's not a... - common occurance. - I'm working through something. You don't need to apologize. I'm... I actually had one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life, so... please, I... - Makes me happy. - So... - So thank you. - You are beautiful right now. Glowing. The most important thing You wanna hit these hams, bruh? They're good. - I have an orange slice... - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not using this if anyone wants one. Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone should have a banana. This is great. Good morning seekers! Good morning, Peggy. I have great news. I just heard from Susan at the Niagara Falls Health and Wellness Expo, and they've had a cancellation. - What? - You serious? Know what this means? We get a booth. - Oh my God! - This is a sign. We've made womb for ourself. We are going be able to speak about Jilling Off to investors. You know what that means? Angel. Startup. Venture capital. - Money, venture, get that down. - Money, venture... Venture... Max, it's just venture capital. What I'd like you to do is take the day. Go out. Allow yourself space for ideas to come to you. To flow through you. Bring those ideas back here. We're all going to be working this. We're all going to be working the convention. This is gonna be great. How can you help? You're so talented and so beautiful. Look what you've manifested already. We have a lot of work to do. I'm so happy to be doing it with you. That's what we should have the booth look like. - Yeah. - Like a womb! Well, I mean, in a proverbial sense. You know. I mean, do you think that's a good idea? Write it down. I was thinking, like... this is a womb with a view. - And it's a view of the future. - Yeah. And you wanna be a part of the future. I'd like you to go out. Take the day. Allow ideas to come to you. What if it was a real macho presentation, right? And there's someone in the audience who, - "No! I object", and... - Oh wow, like a... That's great. That's great. That's a great start. I love it. Let's take the day. Uh, yes, I was... um... Do you know how much space we're gonna have? maybe, uh, how many cubits, or...? - Square footage? - Yeah. Square footage that we have, just so... - so I could imagine... - I would say... roughly... I would say roughly take the day. Yeah, and just to bounce off that, uh, I think it would be great if we could make the investors take a day, but, um, more like... You first though. I'd like you to have that day first. How tall are the ceilings? You know how tall the ceilings are? 'Cuz I was... Maybe we could do something where we come down from the ceiling? You can take this afternoon, all the daylight... We could have, like, a drone sound in the womb. When you're in the womb, it's just buh-bum, buh-bum. Heartbeat, you know? - Love this. I love this. - I think that would like open up the investors to, like, a giving place. Yeah, opening and allowing. Yeah absolutely. Didgeridoo, or something. - Take the day. - Oh, put them in a field... I don't want to be a stick in the mud, or nothing like that, but, uh, I just... I mean, uh... if I'm gonna imagine something, I kinda need to know uh, like, uh... how big it is? Yeah, I mean, I'll forward you the attachment. Okay. Would you be terribly offended if I... I just, if I just take the day? I just want some time to... - You take it! - You guys, I don't know. - I need to take the day. - Just take it. Take the day! But we have the cable guy coming today, so should we mark down tomorrow for taking the day? - Yeah probably. - Great. Alright, I'll lace you up. "Oh too tight!" Oh, oh... Gotta be tight. Ankle support. Get a tough shot here... Like this. Don't be scared. You can do it. This time tell him... Make sure you tell him that like, yes they'll start as demos, but we want to order a bunch. We've got a lot of money to spend. - It's like in Pretty Woman. - I got it. She's got a lot of money to spend. They think she's broke. Thank you for calling Mattress Firm. Where your buck stretches further. This is Anita speaking. Hi. I have a lot of money to spend, and I'm looking for fluid-proof cushions. A lot of them. You're looking for... what was that? Fluid proof cushions. Cushions I'm working with now... it's a crushed... I have crushed velvet cushions, and the cleanup has been hectic. We only sell mattresses. What? - Okay. - I definitely do apologize. Buh-bye. Can you help me identify the parts? Just very briefly. The labia would be here. Mhm. Mhm. The clitoris is here, - or the hood over it. - Excellent. Mhm. Mhm. Inside is the vagina. Mhm. Excellent. So now what we have is an engorged clitorial glans, so it's peeking out from behind it, so treat it very delicately. And lets... you know this is a sharp taste, so let's work through that sharpness and just focus on the object at hand. Which is not an object. It's an energy. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. It's okay, work through it. Work through it. Put it aside. Put that aside. Get in there. Get right in there in the middle. Yeah, you're doing great. That's right. The flat of the tongue. Excellent. Very good. Up against the glans. Important, important labial folds. Many nerve endings. Important also to focus... Focus on the clitoris. Try not to eat it accidentally. Very good. Very good. Consistency. Like a rhythm. Like a one, two, three, four... I want to make your heart soar. Five, six, seven, eight... Female pleasure's truly great, You're doing great. Maybe I should act like your secretary and then I put you through, so you're like a big bus... an important business man. - Maybe you should say... - You're fired! say your name's, like, Mr. Walsh, here. Well, I'm doing paperwork. Come to my office. By The Yard. This is Elaine. Hi, I'm calling from the Law Office of... Judd Warminheimer, and I have a question about a custom order Can I... Can I patch you through? Sure. Okay, thank you. Please hold. Who's this? Me and my friends are looking for some cushions, some fabric, stain-free cushions. A lot of them. Um, okay. Do I have dimensions? - Dimensions of... - Circular. C-circular. Most importantly, with just a fabric... - What is she saying? - Uh... vinyl. What time are you guys open to? I'm gonna have my secretary go down there. You know what, I'm gonna patch her through. You guys work it out. Oh fuck... And then give me dimensions of the cusions. Won't need this. The only thing people care about is that creation energy, that... make, make, make. But what happens to the thing once it's made? Doesn't matter. What happens to the person who's making it? Doesn't matter. We will be able to heal the pain of Mother Earth, the trauma that Mother Earth has experienced. You know, from toxic masculinity, from ego fortification, from goal attainment. All that striving, that useless striving. Feminine energy must receive. Truly. No exploitation. It's very difficult. It's very difficult. Really what we're about is sharing this knowledge with the world, with humans. You have a skillset. We actually have a system which could channel the power of feminine... The feminine pleasure center, of pure pleasure. The male body doesn't have that. It's a secret and holy thing. It needs to be treated with... That is what we do in Jilling Off. Self defense is not just about the physicality. It's about planning things out. It's, like, you see something, you say something. New York City subway rules. But for a person, okay? You have this. You have a eyebrow ring. You have a tattoo of an outline of California... Date rapist. Okay? Pucca shell necklace? Date rapist. What are some names we like for him? Cheese dick! Danny. Danny. Danny? Not as triggering. I'm going with Casey. I'm going with Tanner. Skylar. Chad. - Chad is good. - Chad is good. Okay, so whatever that is to you use it, use it, use it, what am I doing? I'm kegeling. Use it, use it, use it, use it, use it. Asia. - I'm ready, boss. - Great. - Okay, ready? - Yeah. Go back, go back, go back. I'll get better. - Are you okay? - Yeah. We're supposed to catch them off guard, I mean... I don't know how deep they've gone in this class. - What if someone really... - Yeah, I know. Let's look... See this? You're with somebody. You're with a man, touches you like this. How do you feel? You feel... feel weird? Just like Erica. I want you to put you hand right here. Pull back, center balance. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Apprehended. See that? A man has many weaknesses. Okay? Weaknesses - of a man. - Groin. Groin. I would say spoiler alerts for any film or television they're currently watching. Hey buddy, what's up? You know the voice of Bart Simpson was a woman? Give us your purses! Oh no, it looks like we've been apprehended. - Oh no... - Hey! I'm gonna put my cigarette out on you! Ow! Ow! Stop! What are you doing for your birthday? Uh, going on a cruise. What? Yeah, with Bella's new boyfriend, Travis. He's taking us. - Travis? - Yeah. Travis, this is, uh, Jail Travis? I mean, he's a pretty cool dude. He... rides a motorcycle. - Motorcycle? Dangerous. - Yeah. I don't know. He took me out on it. You're too young to be riding a motorcycle. They don't make helmets big enough for people like you. Hey, hi. Hi there. Oh. Looks like a pirate. Sir, go do something else. Um... I was just wondering if you had any film stuff? You know what a dolly is? What are you doing with it? What are you making? - I'm making a film. - What is that? What do you mean? Like, what's the difference between a film and a movie? Oh, a film is kind of more serious than a movie. Movie's kind of for eating popcorn. Film's more, like, inspire you to, uh, write a poem or something. - It's not funny? - Oh no. Let me see what's that. It's my list. Yeah, I don't carry any of this stuff. - You read all that? - Yeah. That was really fast. Yeah, sorry. Can't help you. Is there a movie store? Goddammit. Zoe! What the hell you doing over there? Hey... No one needs to be spoken to like that. Get the magnet! Get the little magnet on a stick! Jesus! - Alright... - Look at this! The magnet's for picking shit off the floor! Magnet's for picking up the nails! Go get the box of nails! Bring me that chain! Have you seen, uh, - what is it? - Which one? Oh, do you know Mae West? - Weird. - She's so cool. Ooh Spartacus. - What is this? - Marilyn Monroe. Ooh! Jane Eyre! I love Jane Eyre. What movies do you have? Gritty realism. Gripping Whodunnit. We should watch this one tonight. Right, okay. I see it. The one where he has the car racing, like... Like, the thing where they play chicken and someone dies. - Look at this cover art. - I like watching old movies. Is there anybody here who didn't see porn at a young age, like find in the woods, classic, woods-finding? On a channel? We had a box. - Yeah. - Of... - Yeah. You were young. - I was pretty young. I think we were all really young when we saw that. I always feel like every vagina I've ever confronted, porn-wise, has been very... how you say... trim. - Yeah. - Not a lot extra happening. Immature almost. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's, like, a really nice shade of pink. - Mhm. - Uh... - Bald. - Looks like it smells nice. Mine's a teamster. Mine went through Vietnam War. Hey, uh, you know... does it... it hurts me to hear you talk about your yonees like you're trying to make it this miserable, abject person, whose, like, overworked, and incapable of functioning, and... - My vagina is Erin Brockovich. - Yeah. And she's gonna make sure that the water is clean. I appreciate it. Just the physicality of it kinda sometimes... still shakes me. But I'm sick of like acting... that my vagina has to be, like, perfect, you know? - Mm, yeah. - Because it's not. Like it's not for a million reasons. You know what I mean? I deal with a lot of grief with this vagina, you know? - It comes with a lot of... - Yeah. It just... so much... I'm so sorry. A lot of crap has come up for me here. While I've been here, I've... never felt as good as I felt before, and that's amazing, but... but all these other things are coming up. All these other things that make me feel guilty about feeling so good. - Yeah. - You know, I just... I... have a weird relationship with... with pleasure, because I've I felt it at a really young age, when I... when I wasn't supposed to. I don't want it to be tainted because of... Bad things that bad people did to me when I was a little kid, but I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah. Where I think that a lot of women's pleasure is tied - to trauma because of.. - Or shame. Or shame, absolutely. I think that owes why this is so difficult for a lot of people. I mean, specifically women. The amount of women that I know who... who don't give themselves orgasms regularly, who don't masturbate. Women are not encouraged to show pleasure, and when they do, they're punished for it. In so many ways, it seems like we're punished just for existing. - Max. - Yeah? On a serious note, maybe you should tell Peggy - about two days ago. - What you told me. Two nights ago... I was alone in my room, and I haven't ejaculated in so long. - Me neither. - Mm. - Are we still working... - Well, you know... that you don't ejaculate here, and this is about redirecting that energy. Can I go ejaculate in the forest? Wait a minute, we're allowed to do that? Just not in my house! - We're allowed to do that? - No! You're not, and you're not. You're not. I'm starting to forget what the rules are are around here, Peggy. Didn't have to raise my voice, but... I don't know. Is it important that you know what all the rules are all the time? Coming! Peggy! Uh... How can I help you? Someone, like, call you guys, or... Someone did call us. Maybe put that out. Peggy? Peggy? There's fire people here? Make sure you note that they don't have the proper fire extinguishers. Need Class A for a dwelling. - What are they doing? - Oh my God. Can you explain this? - Uh, it's a kitchen. - It's a kitchen. Glasses, what's edible? You can't call me Glasses. You have glasses on. I do have glasses on. We both have glasses. What do you have in here? Don't let him in there, Mo. - Make it easy on yourself. - No. No. You go get the proper paperwork, a warrant from the city, or whatever jurisdiction you have, and you can come back here and speak to us, but right now, you're not gonna come in and touch us, and harrass us in our home. Touch that man's face, his cigarette? Get out of here right now. We'll bring the proper paperwork back with maybe a shirt or a pair of slacks for you too, okay? - Scram. - Alright, let's go. Well, maybe we'll get you a shirt and a pair of slacks. Smoke up. I got a friend who's an electrician and went through there, and they said that they... they found a lot of sex things. And he said it smelled real bad. And I told the guy not to judge 'cuz I don't judge nobody, you know, everyone's gotta make the world go round someway or another, and uh, you know, it sounds like, you know, it sounds like they have a good time, put it that way. Action. The way I see it, uh, the body is in my town, it's my jurisdiction. To me, it sounds like... it sounds like somebody is... like wasn't invited to the party, you know, Like someone wasn't invited to the party, and they're pissed about it. But Sheriff, this is my jurisdiction. If I'm here, and you're here, isn't it our jurisdiction? It doesn't take much to upset somebody here because not much happens here. You know what I mean? You can always tell when people aren't from here. It's always pretty obvious. I'm a bike cop, and I'm tired of being pushed around. It's my jurisdiction. What's the deal with these jurisdictions? Cut! We got it! That was so good, you guys. Don't stress me out. I won't stress you out. That's what happens when... when people that are different come into town, you know? - I mean... - But that's anywhere. It's just that people are too, like, here. There's not enough, like, freedom of anything. I miss that. You know what's cool though, is, like, we get to be the weirdos. Yeah, we're the individuals. Yeah, we're the only unique people here. Hurry, your Majesty! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can disagree with what someone's doing, but still be respectful. You know, it's called being an adult. - This is my jurisdiction! - This is my crime scene! This is my jurisdiction! - This is my jurisdiction! - This is my jurisdiction! My jurisdiction! - I'm under... - This is my jurisdiction! Well, you know what I think! I just have a hard time trusting people. I don't know 'em, so I can't trust them. Uh, looking forward to the, uh, cake walk. I'd like to open up the floor now to anybody who might have any... questions, or concerns. Anything that we could be doing a little bit differently that I should be looking into? - I have a concern. - Okay? Um, the sidewalk must be fixed near the bridge. So I walked by the bridge, holy moly. You got that... that happened... that happened at the bridge there? I tripped on that same sidewalk that she just complained about, and uh, it's been like that for years. We gotta get the head of public works in here next week, but you're feeling okay? - Not really. - Who else? You in the back? I think part of the problem with that sidewalk is it's right under Main Street Pizza. There are pigeons that roost on the restaurant, and they're just defecating constantly. It's just a mess, and it's slippery. We should just move the restuarant. Who do we talk to for that? I'm sorry. Anybody else? Oh, we got one more thing over here. Yeah, I'm a little upset because when you talk about town - being visited all the time. - Oh absolutely. Problem is they roll down their windows in their cars, and throw out their beer cans. Believe it or not, I've picked up as much as a bushel basket full. More people are coming, and more cans are coming. - Excuse me, we're here. - Unbelievable. Pink shirt. Thank you so much. Um... We run an educational training center, Jilling Off, which I would love to share with anybody who is curious as to our... what our credo is, and what we do. - Can I see that? - Yes. Here you go. Uh, stuff about... gender energy. - All energy is feminine. - All energy is feminine? Are you investigating this group? Uh, two days ago! We got, uh... word that they filed for a business license, went out to take a look, and found that they had not filed the paperwork. You have to go before the planning board. You have to go before the planning board. - When is the next meeting? - I don't think they meet again for... - about thirty days. - Thirty days. Well, we want to make sure you guys aren't operating as a business, yeah. - ...of the said violations. - Thank you for the... planning board note. If there are no further comments, I move the meeting to be adjourned. - Can I get a second for that? - I second that. Okay, meeting's adjourned. Thank you. See you all next week. Everyone stay safe. We're getting to the core of the issue. And the core of that issue is energy. The masculine energy that I engage with... it's not out of judgement, it is because I want them to learn how to give pleasure. To share ecstasy selflessly. Whatever I say here stays here. Even if it's like really... bad stuff. - Oh a hundred percent. - Yeah. What if it's all bull? What if she's not the real deal? What if I told you she wasn't the real deal? You mean, Peggy? That would scare me, I think, 'cuz... Why are you always apologizing for your penis? Every day, like we start the day with you on your knees apologizing to her, and it's okay. It's really condescending, and I hate it. I hate it. I really felt sorry for my penis. We're not here to discuss our penises right now, and our issues... You sat me down and said talk about what's on your mind. - No... - You rile me up, - No! - I responded as, "Look what - he's doing". - Your tactic is being a victim which is a form of narcissism. I'm not a victim. I'm not the one crying on my knees, "I'm sorry for having a weener!" I'm not the victim. "I'm sorry for cumming. I'm sorry for being a human being." - Hey! We came here - Wake up! to try something. You knew we weren't Wake up! - You wake up! - I'm tired of this! You knew we weren't going to be ejaculating here. You knew that. You knew that. - Push people away 'til you... - ♪ Brother, brother ♪ - 'til they push you away, - ♪ Calm down ♪ and then you can say that's how it is. Return to the circle! Perhaps we'll use our penises again, but right now, we're practicing something else - You always run away. - Awesome. Khan? - Khan? - Stop! Stop! Get off! Don't touch me! - Get off me! Stop! - Khan. Khan. - How are we doing? - Make it a center part, - Doing good? - and then swoop out the bangs. - And... it's a mess right now. - Yep. Yep. You've got some very fearless folicles here. I self-identify as a goddess. And I think you should too. Don't you? Oh my God, no. He's really supportive. Important. He's really fun. Who wants to hang out with a fuddy-duddy? I think I know your boyfriend. - I think I know him. - Bobby? We've run across him. - We've crossed paths. We've... - Mhm. He's been cross at us. Yeah, I'm really trying to say yes to... to most things. - Yes, yes, yes. - Yes. Do you feel safe when you're with him? Um, I mean, like, he pays for stuff. He's not that comfortable with women - taking control. - I mean, but he loves sex. - That's a problem, because... - Mhm. it suppresses women's primacy as healers and people who can give back to the Earth. It's just really hard when you're with somebody who, like, doesn't really, like, believe in you, or, like, care about you, but, like, you care about them so much. I've been treated like that a million times. We are undoing a lifetime, thousands of years, of toxicity, and there will be pain, and blisters, and dams will burst, and avalanches will fall down mountains, and little rabbits will run to their death. If that's what we need to move forward and change the world, then maybe that's our cross, sorry to use a Christian metaphor, to bear. Maybe we shouldn't hate our penises. - We should go do guy stuff. - We can. A break from all this sexy, fantasy, uh... - spirtual... - I get that. - Look, I get that. That's great - The bowling was a great idea. Ice cream's a great idea. There's a great ice cream place - Drive in movies' a great idea. - in town I drove by... Made a lot of sex during a drive-in movie - in my previous life. - We could see a matinee. Tell me your favorite basketball team, man. - Chicago Bulls... - He's having a language... ...the vocabulary. - I'm just tired of... - I get that, brother. Listen, I find myself policing my language here. I find myself walking on eggshells. It's part of a learning process of, uh, I'd overstep my boundaries with women, but that's fine. I would love some time away. We can drink some Wild Turkey if you wanna get drunk, which is toxic, but I'll do that for you. You wanna do that? Yeah! That's what I'm taking about! Come here! Remember that? - Hey, hey, hey. - Remember that? Khan, remember this? No, no, no, no! - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - Whoo! Whoo! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! My bracelet broke. My bracelet broke. My bracelet broke. I can maybe singe it together. It's okay. We just close the circle right now. Say it. We're gonna do this. - We're gonna go to town. - Mhm. - Yeah. - And we're just gonna be men, - Just men in town - Have fun. - We're gonna win. - We're good. Movies and ice cream. I just wanna say that while we do all this, we should just remember that women do have to work fifty percent harder to... - to get fifty percent less. - Amen. As long as we don't forget that while, you know, we're out. Yeah. Okay. I brought you here today to have a moment of release, to engage fully with your shadow self, and to walk with her on your journey. Into this bundle, I release control. I embrace my shadow side as I step onto this threshold. I release my fear. My fear of not being accepted. My fear of not being seen. I release my fear of not being loved. I embrace my shadow side as I step upon the threshold. I release the patriarchy and its attempts to pit women against one another. I embrace my shadow side as I step onto this threshold. I embrace my body. I embrace my thighs and my belly and my chin. I embrace my shadow side and I step into the threshold. We are together. We are as one. Alright, this is Nina Interview Expo Video, uh... one apple. Uh... Take one. - Okay. - That was good. Alright. - Why don't you slow down? - Motivation. Love. Max? It's a little loud, going over my audio. Well, I'm taking my direction from him, so Imma not - hear you, right? - Cut. Alright, let's do it. Come on, guys. We're losing light. It's gonna be kind of chaotic. There's bubbles going, and Max is going to be playing some accompaniment music, just so we don't have to find music. You have to buy that stuff, like any song. I wanted to use a couple popular songs, but you can't do that. Music! Let's go, bud. - Both are good. - Right a little bit. Who's on bubbles? Sun's entering the final lunar stage! Alright, Max, I know! And, go! Action. I'm, uh, really nervous. Stop it. We love you! Mo, words! Scream 'em! Scream 'em! So this is about attraction, not promotion. Cut! I think we got it. Structurally, how do you want it to look? - I mean what's the intention... - I don't know. I know that it's important that we show some of our successes... Show our credibility. So, you know, I know my life is... is changed. - Mine's changed. - Oh definitely. So we need to show that. Mhm. Alright, alright, let's get this cooking. Release this. The pink smoke. That's the feminine power. Each one of these represents a fallacy of the modern era. Injustice. - So Peggy is here, right? - Yeah. That's great. That's going in. And sees, as these are getting knocked down, jump over this, hit the trampoline, and are birthed into the sky. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. Let's do it. Hold your first position. We're setting up the frame! How's this? Do we need to get a higher angle? - How's the frame? - I think it's perfect. - Hey! Hey! - Behind me. Well everyone else is there. - Behind me. - Hey! - Then we go like this. - Hey! - Like this, it's okay. - Hey! Hey! Hey! Can I just speak for ten seconds? If we can all move a little to the lef... uh, right. That's perfect. Alright, this is absolutely perfect. No one move. Oh! - Are the fl... - Max! Max! What do you guys think it's like to not own any possessions? Like, the simple... what is it? - Minimalism. - Minimalism. - I think it would be... - It would be neat without... - Like, no house either? - Like... Yeah, like living in a treehouse? Not owning anything. When I was little, my dream was to live in Italy on a cliff in a treehouse overlooking the Mediterranean. Go! Hyah! Get her! Get her Bobby, get her! You're out! Get it under control! We won fair and square, buddy! ...really mad. He thinks you guys are, like, prostitutes. Bobby doesn't know us, and that's completely... - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. Can I talk to you over here? - Nice to meet you. - Same. - I'm trying to make new friends - You're not friends with... You're always saying I need to make new friends. These aren't your friends. You make new friends in the town. These people are... They're near where you work. They're near the town. - I know where they are. - She just told me the street. Bobby, you're ridiculous. - I'm not being... - You're being ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with this whole town. She's really cool. I feel bad for her. - They're so nice! - They're not nice. - They invited me over. - They're freaks. - Bobby stop. - They invited you over? You bring your mom's underwear again? Yes. It's disgusting! Hello? I knew it. I knew it! Oh come and get me! I knew it... Is it recording? So if you look in here, there's a red... Yeah, there's, like, a red thing flashing. - You see it? - Oh you're huge. - Okay, well zoom out. - There we go. Cool. I don't want this to be a... ECU. What's that mean? Extreme close-up. What are you doing? - Just trying out the camera. - Max, I want... I want to read this on camera to show the process of the... Stop it. - What? - Stop flirting. - Just being nice. - Alright, tell me right now on camera, swear on Peggy's life, - Uh huh? - that you're not... - Not sure what you're asking me - that you're not jilling... outside of the Womb Room. - We're not. - We're not. - On Peggy's life, say it. - On Peggy's life, - before the camera - Erica and I. - Erica and... - Erica and I. Erica and I are not jilling off outside the Womb Room. Alright, it's on camera. - Erica? - Yes? Do you want to do that? Yeah. Hi, I'm calling because I received some alerts on my account. What's the name on the account? Uh, yeah, it's Appleyard. A-p-p-l-e-y-a-r-d. Call me, uh, Pegasus. P-e-g-a-s-u-s. - Okay, it's showing - What? here that the account is overdrawn. There... I'm sorry. It's showing what? Yeah? Oh, Nina. - Yeah. Hey. - Hey. Hey. Yeah, I have to... - I'm sorry it's this... - Yeah. Did you know what... Yes? Yeah, okay, yeah. I'll continue to hold. Oh Dad! Thank you. Thanks. We're... very overdrafted - is what they tell me. Very... - Yeah. I would say at least four or five very's. - Okay, where... - If you want to put that... where is all of this going? And that's, you know, I believe that abundance creates abundance, and... you have to think abundantly in order to... prosper in abundancy, and, um, I really need you to not be nervous - right now. - Okay. - We are strong. - Yeah. We are stronger than this, okay? And in our strength, we can't tell anybody else. - No. - We can't let anybody know. I promise. Of course not. We can't... they can't know. No. We are healers. We can't let this stop us. Okay? Let's just remember that. How are you all? A lot of things. Wounded. Uh, confused. Kinda lived my whole life thinking about, you know, half the things are good, and half the things are... bad. And I kinda tried to always do the good thing, the right thing. I guess what I'm trying to ask is is there really such thing as good or bad? Or is it uh, just an illusion? You feel there's a difference between good and bad? Uh... Absolutely. I'm sorry. Absolutely. I feel like for myself I've been... seeking, uh, a, sort of, a rite of passage moment, you know, to transition from boyhood into manhood, and I tried to do that through... through guns, and I tried to do that through sexual relations with women, and... I just, how do we... how do... how, how, how do I heal these wounds to transition into being... into being a man? I think the fact that you're searching for it in itself is the becoming a man. And there is no difference between being a boy and a man. There's no bone. There's no line. There's just our lives. But there's nothing wrong with you. Asia? Yeah? Are you okay? Fine. Do you want to talk to me about it? No, not really. Mmm... I'm fine. I just wanna go home. This is home. I don't mean this home. What do you mean you want to go home? I don't... I don't feel at home here. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel let down. I feel isolated. I don't like it. I'm not happy. I want to go home. What's going on? I can't tell you how much this has meant to me sharing the room with you, and just this. It's not easy lying here, you know without my shirt on, and just, like, looking into your eyes, um... And I love it, and it still scares me. Um... You've been a wonderful surprise. I've... so much of the tension uh, that I brought into the house when meeting you... I was intimidated. I felt threatened, um. I was unfair to you, and... I have to say something, and I just really... um, please let me get it out. - Try. I know. - I'm scared. I planted stuff in your room. Some... sex, sex lube, and... pregnancy tests, and porno cards and I was gonna bring everyone in here, and go, "Mo's doing something. What does this mean, guys?" I'm not... obviously I'm not gonna do that, um, I'm sorry I didn't give you a chance, and I didn't see you for who you were, when I first met you, um... I like you alot, and um... Yeah. Appreciate you being honest with me, man. Um... I haven't really connected with any, you know, men, or people in general, but especially men in my adult life, and um... Yeah, I, like, never went to camp, or anything. This has been... Thanks for telling me. That would have destroyed me. That would have destroyed me, if you'd... I don't think I could take anymore of this. There was things in my life... - I'm coming over. - Oh no. Shh... Come on. Let it out. I wasn't allowed to cry when I was a little kid. And it sucked... it sucked being sensitive. People will make things out of stone like this like the ancient Egyptians did, just in a desperate attempt for something permanent. Absolutely. We're embracing primal energies. We are engaging with divinity. We are shattering what we have been told about ourselves. We're destroying our programs. We're building new algorithms. I want to heal them. I want to heal them. I want to heal them, and I want I want to be healed. I thought it would be good for us to center ourselves in the knowledge of the feminine that contains and protects us all. Through opening. Through pain. It creates this amazing spiral through which we can penetrate other worlds, through which we can access time. We are not gender. We are energy. We are energy. Take our hands. Take my hands. Say it with me. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. We are energy. Oh my God. I want everything for you. I want everything for you. Everything for you. The world for you. And the world is for you. Ohio. They're here, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. You're here! Where is she? I haven't seen her. We gotta get going. She'll either meet us there or she won't. Wrap it up, guys. Come on. You didn't have food? - No, no. - Not gonna eat? I'm gonna vomit if I eat anything, Peg. It's gonna be a long day. - Okay? - Okay, I guess. I guess... You need to... keep your energy up. I'm gonna go get the bus, so we can go. Yeah, that's great. I'll start it. I'll see you guys soon. That's fine. Thank you. Bye Max. We'll let the world know who we are... - Maybe they have snacks. - Yeah. Going to the Expo, and we're gonna get people to give us money! Wages of the world! What Jilling Off really needs! Let's show 'em right? Girl, you know it. Girl, you know it. - Who we doing this for? - Peggy! - Who we doing this for? - Peggy! - Who we doing this for? - Peggy! Also Mother Earth! - I'm excited to see... - Most of those... People are gonna be doing videos so they might even have, like, uh, a full on, like, drive-in movie kinda screen. That's what I'm assuming. Initially, then we'll grow from there. He's talking about kids of future generations, like how do we have a future generation if we never ejaculate? I'm just asking questions. What was your question? I just, we talk about the future generations, and we're gonna save the world, and then I was, like, but how are we gonna make them if we're never cumming? Doesn't have to do with this Expo right now, and our immediate concern. Yeah, he can speak, but let's answer the question. But they're telling you not to speak. Focus on the Expo. Expo, Expo. Read all about it. I think you're getting wound up in something... I need answers. How would I explain something to someone else? We should table this immense question that you have. Table it for seven more hours because we have to... we have the Expo. I've been nothing but a soldier for this cause. There's nothing you guys could ever point to that I haven't done and broken my ass... Except for right now. Except for right now, that we're asking you to just focus on the task at hand. Just put this in the back for just a moment, - and we are so happy to... - Okay, okay, okay! - I got it! - That's it. Listen to Erica. Listen to Erica. Seven hours. Seven hours. - Okay. - Table it for seven hours. Bro, you can do seven hours. - It's okay. It's okay. - It's just seven hours. Nina! Something feels wrong! And I don't feel heard, and I'm just gonna get through this thing, and we'll talk in seven hours. Though you said, whatever. Alright? I can't... I can't take any more of it. I just wanted to talk. I thought this was my family. Recenter yourself in the group, and decentralize yourself as the topic of this conversation. So we can survive the Expo. You're so sure, and I'm not sure. Are you not sure about the process? Are you not sure... Does no one ever have questions? - Are you guys just... - We all have questions, Why are you asking them? - Talk to me! - Because this is my family! I just want to know if other people question things, if you're ever scared. I feel so restricted! I feel like I'm just not allowed to be! And I just want to be able to be somewhere... Why do you think I came? I've never been allowed to be! I need you to turn to me. I need you to turn to me. She's here for you. She's here for all of us. Look into her eyes. - Look me in the eye. - I'm admitting I have... - We have seven hours! - We can't bring them... I know it's seven hours! It's seven hours! It's seven hours! It's seven hours! I'm gonna be good for seven hours! This need that you feel that's our need for you. That's our need crying out. I need to see that smile. We're gonna get in there. We're gonna set up. We're gonna get on brand. We're gonna get back to our credo. Going to the Expo and we're gonna make money... Going to the Expo and we're gonna get money... Money! Going to the Expo and we're... I think you should... yeah, tell him. What happened? What happened? What didn't happen? I was roving. He was doing the rove, and I was working the door, and we see seven, eight people come in. They're dressed... dressed a little funky. Okay? Look, we're liberal guys, okay? You know, I've seen... I've watched Allie McBeal. Like, we get it. We don't judge. Okay? You know, all the sudden, there's seven people. Looks like there's only one person, if you know what I mean. They... they reached some kind of, uh, what is that word where they... the height of something. Well, this wasn't a, uh... I guess he's... - Well they reached a... - I don't wanna say climax, but it was some kind of climax. Some kind of thing. Very... it was noisy. It was, uh... Listen, this guy's the master, okay, so when I see this guy get rattled, I get rattled. Okay. And what we saw today got him rattled, got me rattled. We get the call to, uh, you know, of the earpiece, and they tell me, I give him the information. I'm an assistant - to the head security guard. - Gotcha. Couple years they say. There was a problem with the credit card that they had used, and uh, you have to leave a deposit when you have these type of booths, and apparently, um, someone upstairs ran the information at some point, and... they... they got a call from the bank, or something. You know, I think they had in their mind that they weren't gonna get in, they were gonna let it be known that they were there, on way or another. Okay? - I think that's... - Yeah, I think that... I think that's it. Um, okay, I'm gonna go check it out. You guys sit tight. It's literally the last thing that we need. Maybe something just got caught in there. It's probably just a flat tire. - What? - It's fine. We have a spare. We have a spare. It's fine. Stop throwing trash. Okay, definitely a flat, and the spare is not there. What do you mean the spare tire's not on the bus? I mean, it was there last week. Why is that funny? Don't laugh. Stop laughing. You're telling me to stop. Are you kidding me? I just checked. It's supposed to be bolted to the bottom of the bus. It's not there. You mean the extra tire that was... - Yeah. - I took it out. I thought it was garbage. I thought 'cuz... - You thought it was what? - I threw it in the woods. You threw what? - You did what?! - Ow! - You did what?! - Ow! - You took it out? - I didn't... - You did what, you stupid idiot?! - Ow! What were you thinking?! Oh boy... I'm sorry... I... I... I'm sorry! I didn't... I... I... I, uh... I'm so sorry. I get... I just... I'm so sorry. I was just stressed out 'cuz of the Expo, and we're out of money, and we can't have... What are you talking about we're out of money? We have a ton of money. What? What do you mean we're out of money? Peggy? - Peggy. - Can't work. We have a ton of money. Peggy, tell them that it isn't true. It was never real. It was always real. Peggy, tell them that it isn't true! What is wrong with you? Listen! What is wrong with you? It's not happening! It's over! - Hey! - It's over! This is not what this is about! This is about Peggy! Yeah. It is about Peggy, and that's a problem! It should be about people! It should be about people treating people like real respect, like humans! Then why are you screaming?! Stop screaming! You put yourself in this position! Stop screaming! You did it! You knew what it was! - Enough already! - Shut up. Don't you ever fucking... Hey! Hey! Hey! - Stop, stop, stop, stop! - Stop screaming! It's okay. You've been in fear the entire time! It's okay. This just got way too violent. Ant, get the fuck out of the bus. Alright, I will! Get your Triple A card! Wait, no. What? No, it's all about the love. It's about the love. That's the whole reason we're doing this whole thing. It was never about the money. I don't care if we don't have money. We have love. It's still in our hearts. That's the whole thing. We can't let this stop right now. Okay, this is the second try. This is like when they killed Kennedy, man. This is like when they popped JFK. Then the whole thing collapsed after that. They took... they took Malcolm from us, and they shot the Prince of Peace on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in 1965 or 4. But we're doing it to ourselves this time. It's like if Lennon killed himself right before he made... that song Imagination which brought so much peace to the world. And it's, like, we had our try, and we're just gonna walk away 'cuz there's not money. And that's sad. And I'm never leaving Peggy's side. Even if Peggy leaves her side, I'm not leaving Peggy's side. I'm Jilling Off until the new world comes back. For a minute, they made it different, and that's what I miss. Now it's back to the same, and I don't want to go back to the same. Well, maybe you should start your own sexual organization. Yeah, I'll probably do that. Thank you for that. Have people come to you. I'll be there. Listen, if I could, I would do something different. There was liability, and again if they weren't covered for that... Everybody's gotta stay safe. We gotta follow the rules. You know, I heard that, you know, they had, like, their business, and because it was... you know, no real business, they got shut down, and, you know, It is what it is. You finally get the thing that you want, and you don't always feel the way you thought you were gonna feel. The whole town suffers. The whole town suffers. We got to become friends, and now they're gone. Sad. I wish it was all different. I wish everyone could do whatever the hell they wanted, as long as you, you know, clean up after yourself. - Do some ring shit. - Oh! Maybe some of us like it, just the way it is. What do you think? The most important thing is the commitment to female pleasure. The feminine energies must receive. Truly, without guilt, without shame, without repression, without exploitation. We are shattering... what we have been told about ourselves. We're destroying our programs. We're building new algorithms. So we have built a space to let go, release, and feel something. Feel giving. Feel receiving. We have to share this. It's... it's a sacred and holy thing. It needs to be treated as such. Shoot! - Jilling off! - Jilling off! Hey, should we light these?
