Why was that lady here today? We're in the system. No one wants us. That's not right. She was just checking on you boys to make sure you're OK. That's all. Sure. When you guys finish eating, wash up and get ready for bed. O.K.? I'm sorry Ms Wilson, but your Mother's house will go into foreclosure within the next 30 days. But Mister Healy I just moved in here with the boys, and we don't have anywhere else to go. I understand, Ma'am, but.. Unless the bank receives the entire balance of.. $27,549.49 by the 15th.. The home will go into foreclosure. Mister Healey, that's in two weeks. I just don't have that kind of money. I really am sorry Ma'am. Marisol, if I don't get this money by the 15th they're gonna start foreclosure procedures and I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh wow, Mae. This couldn't have happened at a worse time. Tell me about it. Have you tried taking out a loan? That's the first thing I did, but they wouldn't let me have one. Oh Lord.. What about the boys? Three of them, right? Yes, and it's tough. Mikey, he's getting worse. I just don't know what's going on with him. Where's the Father? That's a good question. That poor excuse of father Listen Mae. I raised four boys on my own. You WILL get through this. Just pray for me, Marisol. Just Pray. I'm always praying. &lt;phone rings&gt; Hello? Ms Wilson? Yes, this is Ms Wilson. Ms Wilson, this is principle Summers.

I would imagine that this job is important to you. Yeah? Yes sir, but you know, I have a lot going on Mister Fletcher... Ms Wilson. Ms Wilson.

But if our office... I mean... I'm just telling you. If our office receives one more complaint... about anything that concerns the boys.. Then I'm afraid they're going to try to take away your guardianship. No! They can't do that! No, can't take the boys away from me. please, don't let them...

Now my nurse has already administered a couple of procedures for me.. They've given him a couple of nebulizers to open up his airways. Because he was having some difficulty breathing however we have some prescriptions for you also. Now with these prescriptions I'm asking that you make sure to get these filled because he's going to need one for day and one also for night. OK? I'm also asking that you keep an eye on A.J. Because with this season being so brutal for asthmatics.. Keep an good eye on A.J. OK? Yeah, keep a good eye on him because.. Right now, with this season, anything can trigger an asthma attack. Yes Sir, thank you. No problem. A.J. You be good OK? You can go home, OK? All right, you take care. Thanks you Sir. All right, where are your shoes, baby? OK. We can go home. Come on. Come on.

So what's the problem, sir? Ms Wilson. We really need to discuss this in person. OK. Alright. There's been an oversight with the past due loan papers. Because your Mother took out a second mortgage on the home, insufficient payments have been made for the past six months. Unless the entire balance due of $27,549.49 is received... The house will go into foreclosure four days from today. But Mister Healey, that's Friday! I'm sorry, Ma'am. So, what am I suppsed to do now? I don't know, but unless the bank receives the entire balance due, the house WILL go into foreclosure. OK. So can they take a percentage or something, just to slow the process down? Can we do that? I don't think I can do that, Ma'am. &lt;crying&gt; Well look. I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll see what I can do to slow the process down. Do you think you could come up with a third of the balance by Friday at noon? Yes sir. I can do that. All right... That would be $9,183.16 I'll see what I can do for you. OK. Thanks you sir. Thank you so much. Excuse you! Watch where you're going! I'm sorry Ma'am, OK? With your old azz! Good morning! Good morning! Your total's $4 How are you today? I'm wonderful, and you? I'm good? Your total comes to 40 dollars and 12 cents. I'm sorry, it declined. Wow. Aunt Mae, can I get this? Baby, I'm sorry. Maybe next time, OK? Awww man! Baby, could you give me some of that back? Sure. Could you try that for me one more time please? Sure. I'm sorry Ma'am, it declined again. Again? My goodness this is... I got this. Thank you Ernest. I mean Pastor Taylor. I appreciate it. So how you been doing? I've been doing fine... You know? It's kinda tough, but I'm doing OK. Haven't seen you at the church in quite some time now. I know. But we'll be coming back soon... I promise.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look you need to leave. Your son was arrested last night. Do you hear me? I don't have any money to support them, so what am I supposed to do, Don? What? Look Maybeline. They're not my problem right now. You know what? One of these days you're gonna get what you deserve if you don't do right by those boys. They need their Father, you know? I can't deal with this right now. I have a family to take care of. So Michael, A.J. and James. They're not yours? Really? You know, you're a poor excuse for a man. You're a sorry ass man... You know?

Look Ms Porter, I- It's Jacqueline. Call me Jacqueline. OK Jacqueline.Look. I don't know if I can do this. I think it's best if we can just find them a more stable home. What do you mean? Is everything OK? I just think they need to be in a more stable home. I can't provide that for them. Here we go. Thank you. You're welcome. Hope you enjoy. You know... I can't provide that for them. And just yesterday, I saw their Father. I just don't understand why a man doesn't want anything to do with his kids. He don't even care about them. You know... I'm trying here. I really am trying but... Ms Wilson. Unfortunately, their Father has no rights to the boys. He never claimed paternity. His name has never been on their birth papers. Ms Port-I mean Jacqueline, I don't know what I'm doing wrong here. Just last night I had to get Michael out of jail for shoplifting. And that Father. That no good- He just has no regard for them. I just don't under- You know.. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't even know what I'm saying right now... It's just- &lt;cell phone ringing&gt; Hello No, He left with Sandra this morning. Is everything OK? What's going on? Oh my God! I gotta go! What-Where is he? What;s going on? And where is who? It's James. He's missing! I'm going! And you can go with me. My car's parked right outside. OK. Ok. Where do you think he is? I have no idea. I have to call the police. OK. Let's check the house first. I'm sure he's OK. What's your emergency? It's my Son. My Son is missing. Oh my God. He's supposed to be at school this morning but he never showed up. Yes. He's wearing a purple shirt and black slacks. He's about 4 feet tall and- wait! Wait! I think I see him! Where? Over there! Officer, we found him. Thank you so much! Oh my God. Baby, why aren't you in school? I'm sorry Aunt Mae. I'm sorry Aunt Mae. I went to talk to Mom about you and Michael. But baby, why didn't you just come to me? I don't know. Are you gonna send us away? Baby, you know I'd never do that. I would never do that. Hey James. Are you OK? You had us both worried about you. I'm sorry. It's OK baby. Let's go home. Ms Wilson. I need to talk to you for a moment. OK. James, baby. Could you go inside for a moment please? Maybeline. You know I'm gonna have to report this. I don't want to. But I'm gonna have to report this. And I'm sorry. I know. But I'm trying here You know? I just don't want to disappoint my sister or these kids. I know, and I completely understand. Here I am. A young girl. Got married at 25. Had a husband who didn't want to have any children. But I wanted at least 3. And so... I find out that I'm pregnant and I'm so excited. Excited about having a baby. And here he is. He's not excited with me. So. 3 and a half months later.. He tried to kill me, and I have a miscarriage. I had no idea. I am so so sorry. And it's ok. But what it reminds me of.. Is change. This happened nine years ago. Today he would have been nine years old. Wow. I'm so sorry. Look Maybeline. Sometimes things happen. And when those things happen, they steer you in the right direction. You know, when I think about begin a social worker.. Children are really the main priority. They're number one! So my thought to you is, If you wanna have those kids- if you want to raise them, raise them. If you don't want them, let somebody else raise them. But those children deserve to be with you. They WANT to be with you. God I really need you right now. I REALLY need you God, right now. What a surprise. God is- &lt;laughter&gt; Well hello Ms Wilson. Hey Pastor Taylor. Thought you was God there for a minute. So how are you doing? I'm fine. And the boys, how are they coping? They're doing better. You know, the other day at the store, you guys rushed out so quickly, I didn't get a chance to talk to you. Yeah, sorry about that. But I really do appreciate what you did. Think nothing about it. It's just been tough, man. I'm just taking it one day at a time. I'm sure. You know, he never said this journey we call life was gonna be an easy one. It can be very tough. Hey man. You coming? Yeah man. What? Your Mama let you out this time? Aren't you suposed to be in bed? Real funny I'm trying to get outta here. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it, you know? with these kids. The bills... just everything. It's just too much. Hmm. Talk to me. The bank is gonna foreclose on my Mother's house... and Michael, he's just all out of control. You know, he got arrested a couple of days ago? This whole life has just been so hard... and James! James ran away. It's just been too tough. I thought I lost him. You haven't lost him. Hey, let' stalk about this "Pastor Taylor" stuff. &lt;laughs&gt; I think you and me are way past the "Pastor" title. You better be calling me Earnest. OK Earnest. I just feel like I'm way over my head here. I'm the oldest. I'm supposed to have it all together. But I don't... It's just tough. You know, the last time you sang for us at the church, it was you and your sister Sharon. I remember. You sang that song.. "He is able." I never forgot that. He IS able, you know? Yeah, that was Mama's song. She loved that song. You know, that time when Sharon was in the hospital sick, she said y'all, He is able! And we all sang that song. Nurses came from everywhere just to see what was going on. I'm sure they did. &lt;laughter&gt; Your Mama, Dell, She was no joke. &lt;laughs&gt; All right boy, lets see what you're made of. I ain't got no money. Money? Who said anything about money? You're not scared now, are you? Naw man. Just keep the engine running. You know those apple pies your Mom made? They were delicious. No wonder my Mom and her were always.. In the kitchen at my house eating those apple pies. Maybe that's why I always had to sneak a piece of them, you know? I sure miss her a lot. She always knew what to say. She was a great lady. How's Mother Taylor doing? She's doing great. My Mom's wide open. She's got more energy than I do! Would you give her my love please? I'll do it.

Anyway, she came in and put the full balance on my desk. $27,549.49 It was the strangest thing I ever seen. She didn't speak much. She just had the biggest, brightest smile. She said "Put this on the account of Adel Wilson." Well this is unbelievable! Oh my God! God is SO good! Thank you SO much! I wonder if she's single. Hmmm Miss Maybeline! How you doing?
