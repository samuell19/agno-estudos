Baby, turn off the alarm. Baby, turn off the alarm. I just want five more minutes. Well, you could take 10 if you want, but you're gonna have to get used to these early mornings. New job doesn't start for a week. Well, speak for yourself. Don't worry, you'll find one. No, we should get up. I promised Gretchen that I would get her the photo album today. - That's important. - It is. Okay. For you, five minutes. This is dispatch for Chief Haybourne, over. Wayne, it's Luanne. Are you there? Over. I knew I should've packed that thing. Chief, you out there? All right. All right. Hold your horses. This is Wayne. Go ahead, Luanne. Wayne, we've got a situation over at the Bachman farm. Is this something Stan can take care of? Something's happened to Rolf. - Is he okay? -I don't think so. Maria was pretty upset. All right. Tell Stan to meet me over there. What? What's wrong? Something happened out at Rolf Bachman's place. What? I'm not sure. Look... You don't have to do this. Well, last day or not, I'm still the chief. No, I mean, sell your family's home, quit your job, everything that you're doing for me. You just stay here. This little town of 600? I'm not really sure they need a professor of cultural anthropology. Smart ass. Besides, you know, I'm ready to go. I had my fair share of speed traps and parking tickets. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. - You gonna be all right? - Yeah. I'll call you when I know something. Oh, God. Okay. Go on, get off of there! Get out of here! Go on! Tough guy, huh? Catch this. Hey! It's okay. He's just a bird. Get out of here! Hell of a last day, huh, Chief? Yeah. This is dispatch for Chief Haybourne. Over. Chief, you out there? Yeah. Wayne here. Yeah... We just got a call from Martha. I guess Clyde Mackenzie's been shooting off his gun again. And, well, he shot up the place pretty good this time. Is he still out there? That's negative. She saw his bus leave 10 minutes ago. -Copy that. I'll check it out. - Okay. Hey, did you get in touch with Doc? Yeah. He said he'd get there as quick as he can. Fine. Thanks, Luanne. Try not to let Marie see him when you move him, will you? You know, I don't know how she's gonna keep this place going on her own. Well, she'd probably be willing to sell. Bank will have it soon enough, you know. Pretty hard thing. I mean, a man walks out of his house in the morning, probably thinking about what he's gonna do next week, next month. And just like that, no next week, no next month. All right, look, I'm gonna go try to find Clyde. Stay here and wait for Doc. When he gets here, have him look at those scratches, will you? Sure. Give it a look. Tell me what you think. - Thanks, Betty. - See you, George. Hi, Rachel. Oh, here, let me help you with that. That's 30, 40, 50 for the week. - Thank you. - You bet. How's Sarah and Joshua? Good. Growing very quickly, and they eat everything. Can we have a little more coffee please? Yeah, be right with you. Tell them next time if they come with you, ice cream is on the house. - See you next week. - Goodbye. Hi, Betty. Clyde. This coffee wouldn't be a remedy today, would it, Clyde? I told you before, Betty, I don't touch the stuff no more. You look like you slept in a barn all night. Well, that's just my natural beauty. Joke all you want, but you got a steady job now, and I wouldn't wanna see you screw it up. Well, heck, I didn't know you cared. Everyone has to have a hobby. The usual? I tell you, today, Betty, I'm gonna have my eggs scrambled. Scrambled it is. Oskar? Hello? Jacob, you scared the life out of me. May I ask why you visit? Well, I just stopped by to give Gretchen a gift. She cannot accept it. Well, Oskar said it would be okay, so I figured I'd just come by and... It would be vain for Gretchen to accept this book. Such books are only to look at ourselves. No, it's not just pictures of her, it's pictures of everyone. It's... It's a record of our time together, our friendship. God punishes for such friendships. Do Oskar and Gretchen feel that way? I speak for all. Sorry, but I have a hard time believing that. Where is everyone? I should be getting back now. Oh, I also came to say goodbye to everyone. I will tell them you were here. Please do. It says "with service." Well, where's the service? - Morning all. - Good morning, Wayne. - Wayne. - Hey, Wayne. Hi. May I speak to you outside for a minute? Me? Yeah. - So, how's it going, Clyde? - Pretty good, Wayne. How about you? Good. Thanks for asking. So, your neighbors called in a complaint, said you were firing a gun this morning. Who said that? I can't help you if you're not straight with me, Clyde. Martha, wasn't it? It's illegal to fire a gun inside the town limits. - Yeah. - I'm not gonna take you in for that. She should mind her own business. Well, why don't you tell me what happened? She should tend to her own affairs. She said it sounded like hunting season, Clyde. You know, that could have been me, but... I tell you, Wayne, something weird happened to me this morning. Well, I'd certainly like to hear it. You know, Clyde, if you can't talk... I got attacked by a big bunch of birds this morning, Wayne. - You were attacked by birds? - Yeah, they came after me. They were... You know you have a reputation, Clyde. Whoever replaces me might just not cut you as much slack as I have. - Right. - Yeah? - Morning, Doris. - Hi, Chief Haybourne. - Hey, Clyde. - Yeah. - Hi, Wayne. - Good morning, Betty. Papa, you really don't have to pick me up this time. No, no, no, I will pick you up here. But Mr. Mackenzie drops all the other girls off at home. Gretchen, you're not like all the other girls. Maybe after today, you should not be with these new friends? I don't like it that you learn so much about the ways of the English. - Maybe God does not like it so much, either. - Papa! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. I'm your father, so I cannot possibly understand. Gretchen, be careful anyway, especially today. - I will, Papa. - Good. What we do is nobody's business. We must keep what has happened to ourselves. - I understand, Papa. - Good. Move it. Move it. It's cold. Move it. - Hey, Clyde. - Hey, Coach. Ah, not much of a turnout, is there? Well, it was snowing pretty bad at my place, Coach. You don't think they'll cancel it, do you? What do you think? - Is this all you got? - Yeah. - You're playing a game? - No, it's just a workshop. I'm relieved to hear that. - Okay, let's go. - Yeah? Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh, hey, Gretchen! I didn't see you there. What can I get you? Today, it's on the house. Thank you, but it's been kind of a rough morning. I don't really have much of an appetite. I think I'm just gonna stick with coffee, if that's all right. Is everything all right with Clyde? Yeah. Yeah, he's gonna be good. I worry about him. He's finally getting his life back together. Jeez, look at those crows. They're huge. Those aren't crows. Those are ravens. Ravens? Yeah, the weird thing is, they're normally not the most social creatures. You hardly ever see more than two of them at the same time. My grandmother used to say ravens were the eyes of the devil. Aren't they supposed to be as smart as dogs? Smarter. I imagine they could be quite a nuisance if they wanted to be. Betty, I think I'm gonna take this to go. Oh, yeah. Sure. So, what do you think happened, Doc? You know something? I don't really know. Hey. You okay, son? Yeah, yeah. I just have never done this, at least, with the bag and everything. Don't feel bad. When I first got the contract as coroner for the county, I didn't sleep very well at night myself. Yeah, but then after a while it's not so bad. Stan, I brought half the people in this county into the world, and it felt right, going the other way never does. Come on. Let's get Rolf out of here. Son of a bitch! I'm not lost. I don't want to fight, okay? But look, we must be lost. We're on a dirt road too small to even put on the map. What the hell is this? Wait in the car, all right? I'll see what's going on. Hey! You okay in there? John? Oh, God. Oh, my God! What happened? - Is she dead? - I don't know. Just wait there. John! John, are you okay? Get in the car. Let's get the hell out of here. - What do we do? - It's okay. Come on. Go in. - Get us out of here, John! - Come on. Come on! - What's going on? - I can't see anything! Come on! Get off the car! Oh, God. Get... Get, get out of here! Okay. Hang in there. I'm gonna get you to the doctor. Luanne, this is Wayne. I need you to get the fire department and EMT over to Donaldson by the old railway bridge immediately. We got one vehicle on fire, and there are two deceased at the scene. -Stan, it's Wayne. - Go. I'll finish this. Stan, it's Wayne. Do you copy? Stan, it's Wayne. It's urgent. Do you copy? Yeah. This is Stan. Go ahead. Where are you? I'm still at Rolf's with the Doc. Well, get him back into town immediately. There's been a hell of an accident out on Donaldson Road. Tell Doc I've got one female in critical condition, possible fractures and internal injuries. A few more pieces of wood, Jacob. God tests us, Jacob. You say we must keep these troubles to ourselves and mend our ways. I am not so sure this is what God wants us to do. It is no test, it is punishment. It is a disease. The punishment will grow if we continue to ignore the old ways. But we cannot hide this. Do you see no answer to our problems but to shut out the rest of the world? The answer is to obey God, and his will is clear. The disease will only get worse. And we will do great harm to ourselves and the English. Our fathers were not open to the English. They would never have allowed Mrs. Haybourne to come and take their pictures. You would blame this on Mrs. Haybourne? I blame myself and I blame you for inviting her into our homes, to eat from our tables, to appeal to our vanity. It is not our way. And now, our children mingle with the children of the English, and go to their school, and forget who they are, because we have allowed them to. Our children are not prisoners, Jacob. And we do not have the sickness in our herd because our children go to the wrong school. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that it was a sign, and we did not pay attention. So God sent another sign, the black birds! Two plagues, Oskar. Punishment. There could be no other way. We have waited far too long to mend our ways. It is time for us to destroy that which has brought this upon us. We have forgotten who we are. If we do not remember soon, we will have nothing. What? What? Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! I am here. I have seen Mrs. Haybourne's automobile. It is at the bottom of the road. Gather the others. When she is located, we will put a stop to this once and for all. I was fearful of this. Do you see what it has come to? And do you now see what we must do? Take this. Come on. I got you. Here. Get the door. Right inside. On top of the table, Wayne. Thanks. Poor little girl. She looks bad. Give me that black bag over there, will you? Stan, there are some unguents, some ointments, in that cabinet in there. Bring all of them. Thanks. There was a raven picking away at the flesh on her leg. Ravens? Two of them, but there must have been more. Rachel Friesen was dead in the other truck. Something had eaten away at the flesh on her face. - God almighty. - Wayne? Rolf Bachman was covered in lacerations just like this. Wayne! Wayne! You've got to see this. I've never seen anything like it. What the hell is going on? Tyler. Hang on, buddy. I'm coming. Stan, put the gun inside. You have to be kidding me. They don't like the gun, Stan. Put it inside. - But... - Take it inside! She's gone, Stan. Okay, Tyler. Take it easy. I'm coming, Tyler. Just take it easy. Hang on. They don't have a chance. Stan! Get the hell back inside. Get the hell back inside! Stan! Get off! - Mom? - Tyler! Hey, Clyde! Emma said start warming up this piece of junk. We'll be ready to go in 10. I know you're in there, Clyde. I heard you moving. Yeah. Okay. Okay! You're such a freak. Oh, God. Sorry, Wayne. I told him to stay inside. Why the hell didn't he just listen to me? Just doing his job, son, exactly the same as you. It's as if those birds were using Tyler as bait. I never knew the damn things were so intelligent. What is going on, Wayne? What are these birds? Look, we don't know why the birds are doing what they're doing. Is that Stan? Listen. We need everyone to go home. Go home and stay inside. Find all your family members, make sure they stay inside as well. Call everyone that you know. Can't do that. The phones are dead. - What, everywhere? - They are here, I know that. All right, listen. Everybody go home. Don't do anything until you hear from me. All right? - Everything's gonna be fine. - Okay. Watch this. - Hey! Hey! - Hey! You... Don't throw that thing around the bus. Sorry, Clyde. They're just a little worked up. Well, if they're worked up, I'll stop the bus. You can get off and walk home. Okay. Okay. I'll take care of it. Hey. Hold on to it or Clyde's putting you off the bus. - Oh, yeah? I'd like to see him try it. - Doris! Sorry. It was an accident, Emma. We were just fooling around. Okay, well, if that ball gets loose again, he's gonna throw all of us off the bus, all right? - Okay. - Thank you. Clyde's such a loser. Hey. I'd just as soon you didn't sit there. You're bothering me. May I ask why you look to the sky and fields? No, you may not. I see that you have brought your baseball club with you today. It's a baseball bat. Don't you Amish play baseball? We are not Amish, we are Mennonites. But I think you know that very well. Well, whatever you are, why... Why don't you go make a quilt, bake a pie, raise a barn? Stop sitting behind me. Stop looking at me. Please. Hey! I told you. Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Damn. Luanne? Yeah, Wayne, I got all kinds of calls in here before those phones went out. Birds have been attacking people all over town... Luanne, Stan is dead. What? Contact the County Sheriff's office. Tell them we need a hand up here, and we need it now. Of course, copy that. Sorry to have to tell you that way, Luanne. Copy that, Wayne. Listen, can you do me a favor? Can you forward me to channel four? I'm trying to get in touch with my wife. Okay, Wayne. Go ahead. Cynthia, can you hear me? If you can, pick up. It's important. Cynthia, if you can hear me, please pick it up. It's important. Okay. - You want to try it again, Emma? - All right. Oh, okay. Stop, stop. Don't burn out the starter. Clyde! Again? Clyde's a little scared of the dark. Sit down, please. Please, just go. Go. Whatever. Doris! Are you planning to use that bat of yours on the engine? You might want to steer clear of me right now. Oh, I'm so scared. Just get back on the bus. Clyde, I could walk to town faster than you can fix this damn thing. Okay. The town is four miles that way. You want to walk? Be my guest. - Do yourself a favor. - You know what? I will. Good idea. Hey! Doris! That's enough. Just get back on the bus and let Clyde work it out. Forget this. I'm walking. It's not that far into town. - Anyone coming? - No! Anyone hear what I just said? No one is going anywhere. Connie? It's pitch black out there, Doris. Oh, come on. You're just as bad as bat boy there, you know that? Doris, that's enough. No one is going anywhere. - Yeah. - Hey! Doris! You are not walking into town! You hear me? Get back on the bus. You hear me? Get back on the bus! Get on the bus now! What are you doing? There is no saving them! Do you want to die as well? Make it stop! Make it stop! Make it stop! They're gone! Gretchen! Gretchen! They're gone! What are you doing? We only have a few moments before they come back. What makes you so damn sure? We are wasting time! All right. All right. Get Doris on the bus. Emma? Emma? What are we gonna do? - Why isn't she saying anything? - Emma? Emma, you're gonna be okay. Coach? - She can't even hear us. - She can hear you. Please, get them home. Oh, God. No. No. Please, no. - Oh. - No! No! Why are you doing this to me? We mustn't stay here. They will return soon. What do we do? We die. Shut up, Connie! Just shut up! Nobody else is dying, all right? All right? I'm gonna go and have another crack at that engine, see if I can get it running. I'll help. No. You all stay here. Make sure that door is closed tight after me, okay? If you see anything, you just give a shout. You are bleeding. We must get you help. It's not my blood. There's a rotting animal down there. I was going to destroy it. You stay the hell away from me, Jacob. I do not understand. I heard you and Oskar. I saw you at the fire. It is our curse. And I'm part of your curse, too, right? - No, not you! I did not mean you! - Stay back! I'm so sorry. We did not know what to do. The cows got sick and then the ravens came. For three days, they fed on the dead cattle. What was that? Gretchen, open the door! It's stuck! Gretchen! They're coming back! It's stuck! I can't get it! Gretchen! It's stuck! It won't open! Get it open! - Connie! - I can't get it! Connie! Connie, would you help? Close the door, Gretchen. Close the door. Cynthia, can you hear me? Cynthia, if you can hear me, please pick it up. It's important. Cynthia, are you there? Hi, Oskar. - Doc. - Betty, are you all right? I'm surprised you're still open. Well, I stayed open for Oskar. He's waiting for Gretchen to get back. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I was expecting my daughter's bus to be back by now. Clyde's a good man. He'll take care of those girls. They have been almost an hour past due. He'll be along shortly, I'm sure. - Betty? - Yeah? When the bus comes and Oskar's out of here, I want you to close up shop. Would you do that for me? - You got it, Doc. - Good girl. I think they're gone. They are not gone. Why are they doing this? Keep your head down! Oh, my God! We're all gonna die! This is it! Watch your heads! Stay down! We're never gonna make it! What was that? There's Wayne. Get back in the bus until help gets out here. No. I'm staying out here, Wayne. I hear you're not too bad with these things. What gives you that idea? Sorry, Clyde. I should have listened to you this morning. Wayne, are you out there? Wayne, do you copy? Are you out there? Copy, Luanne. We got a real predicament here. Wayne. Yeah, okay. The state police are coming as soon as they can, but they've got a big pile-up on the interstate right now, and they're shorthanded. Listen, Luanne, we're stuck in Clyde's bus out at Parker's place. You got to get us help immediately. Do you understand? Okay, Wayne. I'm gonna do everything that I can. So, just take care. Make it happen, Luanne. Make the call and get us help. Listen, I'm gonna try and get everybody up to Betty's as soon as possible. Luanne, do you copy? Luanne, do you copy? Wayne? Wayne, it's Cynthia. Hey! Look out, Wayne! Wayne, do you copy? Wayne? Everybody get to the truck, now! Come on, girls! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Let's go. Yeah! Wait. Wait. What about Coach? We'll come back for her. Get in the truck. Get in. Evermore dispatch, this is the state police. Luanne, you still need us out there? Luanne? Anybody hear that? - They're coming back. - Where are they? Why are they doing this, Wayne? I don't know. Everybody hang on! We're stuck in the mud! They're gonna get in. Oh, Christ. Hey! Hey! It's Betty's! Let's go! Let's go! It's too far. Connie! Hey! Get back. Get back! - Where's Connie? - We must get going! No. I have to find her! Connie! Connie! I can't find Connie. I can't find her! I'll find her! Go back to the diner! - Go back to the diner! I will find her! - Connie! Are those gunshots? Jesus. Connie, please answer me. Connie! I'll find you. Where are you? Connie! Connie! Oh, God! Connie. Come out! Come out! Wayne, come out! Connie, where are you? - Where has she gone? Where is she? - She's gone! Let's go to the diner, now! Let's go! Let's go! Keep going! - Gretchen! - Come on! You must run! Over here, quickly! - Cynthia. - Come on, Gretchen! - Keep running! - Papa! Come on, keep... Keep... - Where's Wayne? - Right... He's right there. He's okay. - Here! - Let's go! Run! - Come on! - Cynthia, get inside! - Get inside! - Hurry! Papa! - Everybody inside! - Wayne! - Let's go! Get inside! - We must get inside! - Quickly! Everybody! - Cynthia, get inside! Get inside. Over here. Oh, my God, Wayne! Thank God, you're all right. - I'm fine. - I thought you were hurt. I'm fine. I'm fine. I heard the gunshots... Easy, easy, easy, easy. - Betty, come here. - Yeah, I'll take care of her. You are safe now, Gretchen. You are safe now, okay? We must leave now before the birds return. All hell broke loose. You wouldn't believe... I know. I know. I heard it on the police radio. - You did? - Gretchen, come. Where have you been? I was at Oskar's. I was trapped. It was horrible. Oskar's? What... What does Oskar have to do with this? Gretchen, come, please. Let him tell you. - Gretchen, come. - You tell them or I will. Oskar? Gretchen, come. Papa, please, don't be afraid. I know all about it. I talked to Jacob. You have much knowledge, Mrs. Haybourne, but there are many things that you do not understand. Oskar? You've known about these damn birds all along, haven't you? Papa, please. We have not kept to ourselves, as we believe God wants, and he is punishing us for it. Are you trying to blame us for this? All right. All right. Now, when did this all start to happen? It began after the harvest moon, about two weeks past. One of our cows became sick, then a few more, and... I believe it is true. They have the cow sickness that you call mad cow disease. What? Are you sure of what you're saying? We have been afraid of it, the same as any other farmers. We know the signs. So, you knew about this and you didn't warn anybody? We were afraid that the English, they would come and destroy our cattle. Oskar, you can't keep something like that to yourself. It affects everyone. It affects the whole community! A lot of people have died, Oskar. Oh, please. Please, we did not know that it would come to this. Yeah, we have wronged you. All right. All right. The cows died, then what happened? When we found the first dead cow, the black birds, they ate the flesh. The birds were feeding from the infected cattle? Yeah. Yeah, they got a taste for it. Well, that's it right there. The ravens got the disease from the cows. After we burned the dead cows, the birds had no more cattle to eat. We thought they would go away, but it only seemed to make them angrier. They turned on us. I should... I should never have listened to Jacob. I was weak. Maybe it would have turned out different. Are we all gonna get sick? Doc? Are we? Are we all gonna get sick, too? They're coming back! We gotta get these windows covered. Grab whatever you can, put it against the glass. Good idea. Hey, Betty! Betty, you got a flashlight? Get me some tools! Betty, you got a hammer, nails? What have you got? Get me some nails and a hammer now! - Good, good. Hurry! - Here, Oskar. Take over! Okay, Doc! Get that bench! Bring it over here! I need the bench, Doc! Gretchen, bring that chalkboard. Hurry. Hurry. Gretchen, hurry. Everybody, hang on! Hang on! Cover the back window! - Doris, get that table! - I'll get it! I'll get it! Hang on! They're getting in. Damn it! Betty! Betty! I got her, Betty. Under the table. Under the table. Cover your eyes! Cover your eyes. Cover... Cover your eyes! You, too, Gretchen, watch your eyes! Gretchen, get underneath that counter. Get underneath that counter, both of you. Betty? Betty? Oh, Betty. I'm going out there. No! No, you can't go out there, Clyde! They'll cut you to pieces. Betty's dead. I'm going out there. We got to do something. Wayne! Clyde! What are you doing? Get back in there, Wayne! Clyde! Get back inside, Wayne. I'm gonna do it! Clyde! Get in here! You got to go! Clyde! Clyde! - Clyde! What are you doing? - Get back in there, Wayne! Clyde! No! I don't hear anything. Oh, I think it's been a couple of hours. Do not believe we are safe just because we have not been attacked again. What do you think, Doc? I think Gretchen probably knows more about this stuff than we do. Well, I'm getting sick of just sitting here. My daughter is right. They are just waiting. Well, I'm not gonna be cooped up in here - For the rest of my life. - Just, just... Just sit tight. I'll check it out. - Wayne... - It's all right. It's all right. Wayne? Wayne? What's happening to the birds? They're all dying. - Clyde must have finished them off. - No, that's not it. There's something else going on here. I've certainly never heard about this with birds, but it's running its course. They're dying. They're dying fast. You know, my offer still stands. We could stay here. Yeah, well, I don't have a job anymore. Well, I'm sure they'd be thrilled to have you back. Well, let's just give it a couple of days, see what happens. You know, you still owe me 15 minutes. I owe you a lot more than that, but it's a hell of a good place to start. - You coming up? - Yeah.
