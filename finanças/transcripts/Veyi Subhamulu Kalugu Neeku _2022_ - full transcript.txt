I don't know how you feel, but every minute I am being away from you I feel like hell. Im not understanding my postion in ur heart How do my parents understand And I can't hurt them anymore for you Chaithu. Go and say them that we don't suit each other. She have imagined a lot which will not happen. Divya..Divya..Divya Please. Let me explain Divya. I wanted to meet and talk to you about our love once I buy a new home. But I could not make it. Even now I am behaving like this because of my situations. Not because I don't love her. Divya has been waiting for me all these years. No one has understood me as much as she did. Divya has everthing in extremes. Be it love, anger or care. Divya I need for life and just for few memories. I would die if you leave me mid-way. Uncle, I would marry Divya on anydate you wish to.

You, me and everyone lives only for ourselves and our people. I Learnt that living meaningfully is about helping people. I have learnt this from Uday. I’m following you from past 1 year but you never cared, I feel like dieing when I don’t see you, I don’t know what you are thinking about me, I like you very very much, they said that if someone falls in love they write poems like kalidasu, but I don’t have that impressing and love expressing skills, Ms. Sarayu hidden heart and my love are not much different. Uhh..I said all that was in my heart and the burden was lifted, Think about my love. Lift Please. No one is stopping. We’ll ask again Get in. Get in carefully [kids cheering and fighting in the backside] Chanti, if you make noise this way, sister will drop us right here. What are your names ? My name is Swecha, he is Chanti and she is Keerthi. Nice names. Thank you, sister. Sister, stop here. Is your house here ? Need to walk little inside, sister. Then, I will drop you at your house.

Bye sister. bye. The way he is. Am so sorry, I thought bad about you, without knowing you. If a guy follows a girl everyday, it's okay to think he is useless. And that little girl? Her name is Swecha, she is staying here since 2 years. very talented, smiles all the time and makes everyone happy around her. Doesn't she have anyone ? I found her crying at signal one day, then I brought her here. She brings every orphan like her she finds. You are really great Let's be friends. oh, sure. ****SONG You're my raining garland... Tune to my heart land Life to my swaying imaginations, Swing high and hard You're my raining garland... Tune to my heart land Life to my swaying imaginations, Swinging high and hard Floating on the edges of the sky, Lost in your thoughts I am on cloud-nine, Playing your image on and on You're my raining garland... Tune to my heart land This house is so beautiful, Uday. My mom's memory. The one and only thing I feel my own is this house, I was born and brought up here. I sometimes feel like, my spirit will roam here itself after my death I love this house so much. My heart is pounding, Like never before for you, Filling the eternity with me, Seeking you. Where you stand.. Is where my heart is found. Your smile skips my heart a beat, Always fighting to enslave my every bit. You're my raining garland... Tune to my heart land Life to my swaying imaginations, Swing high and hard I was afraid that no one can replace you both, Mom But now, I am afraid i'll not miss you anymore. Days won't be same always dear. You didn't trust me when I said, our life will turn better one day. Now see, I wonder am I seeing the same Sarayu. That credit goes to only Uday He is the best thing that happened to you. I have seen no one coming for me since my childhood. They are around only for my wealth. But, Uday, he is not like others. Don't be late then, tell him what you feel like. Hi. Hi. I need to tell you something. Me too.I want to ask you something. What is it ? I need 10 lakhs, it's an urgency. Dont ask me why. Can't you even tell me ? sorry, it's my personal, I can't tell you. Personal??? Okay... not 10 lakhs.. I will give you 20 lakhs. But you should not follow me again. I should not see you again. Will you give me the amount ? Thank you. Your beauty has turned storm, Drenching me in love Your words turn into tune, Piercing thru me as rays of Full moon. Left alone without you, Though surrounded by a few. Walking along the shores, As the thoughts of you inside me roars. In the waves of your quirky feats, I drown to reach your feet. Swecha, Don't feel bad. I will take care of you. I can't leave this orphanage sister, sorry. Driver turn the car. Take me to the Orphanage. Uday bro is running this orphanage with his own money for the orphans like me. Everyone we meet in our life may not be great, but their memories will be. Such a severe disease for this little girl. Uday strived alot to save her. He sold his house and sacrificed his love. But could not afford Swecha's life. Such a little girl, died in my own hands. This should not happen again to anyone. Let's plan to collect fund from everyone we knew and start a foundation on her name. Let us strive that no ones dies like her. Sarayu, Have you lost your mind? Why are you giving all the wealth to foundation? You are thinking about my life, but Uday is thinking " How to save their lives ? " When I am with him, I don't need this wealth. Let me be part of the good deeds he is doing. Thanks for coming Uday. It's okay Sarayu. Shall we drink something ? Okay. Let me get you something. You wait, I will get it. okay. Brother, two coconut water. Hello. Thank you, brother. [Rash driving sound] Sarayu, careful. Watch out. Uday... Sarayu... [Lorry breaks crackling sound] Sarayu... [Steel rod hitting sound] Sarayu.... I planned to express my love by gifting this house to him and live happily with him. This is the house Uday sold for saving Swecha's life. He loves his house alot, he will definitely come here. I will express my love to him and leave this world permanently. Chaitu garu, Please don't sell this house. You are loving him alot, even after your death. Could you please let me stay in this house till he comes. Stay as long as you want, but don't scare me. No Chaithu. I'll wash your clothes too. No need. Glad if you don't trash me. [laughing] he is staying in a monster house but also this guy is so great. Hi, what happened?? now a days u stopped looking at us. Did any new shutter got connected? What?? I mean, u started staying in a ghost place, are you fine?? You have no doubt. All are correct. I have a doubt. Is there any ghost in that house?? Let me tell you a secret. Sometimes some items are missing in your supermarket Om my god, He likes to bother with my work. The ghost in our house comes here when she’s hungry she is stealing items from your supermarket. Ooo this is not about me. Tommorow or they after tommorow she’ll eat you also. Be careful [phone clicking... busy tone] These humans are really trouble some, They keep changing faces according to their needs. If they cut the call like this, I wanna cut his throat. Go, get that guy. We'll kill him. [bike sound] Guys wait. He is coming our way. I thought you will die below 25, but seems like you have 100 years. Sorry sir. Got a little delay to arrange the cheque. What's this cheque man? I don't want to sell the house to you. [Sarcastic laugh] I asked him to finish.. He finished me..! Look brother, elders always suggest to stay away from bad people. Even if you're not willing to sell, I am not willing to give up on the house. Don't turn me furious and awaken the monster inside me. I have already lost my mind with ghost inside my house. And now you? I thought of sending you the cheque, as it would be ill-mannered I brought it. I don't want to sell my house. See, I have a habit of killing whoever doesn't obey me. Our guys think its easy to construct a house, but I think it's even more easy to kill one. Give me the rod. My dear rod, what do you want ? This little guy's head??? Are you trying to scare me, sir ? How come you thought of fighthing with a bad-ass like me? I forgot to tell you. I have encashed and spent the cheque you gave. I'm giving you my cheque... use it ! You can spend this one without any issues. If you still feel like having an issue, I will use the weapon properly. [bike sound] Yeah, Divya come home. I am on my way. Come on guys. How dare you warn our brother? We are all there for our him. Whom do you have ? I thought it would be done if I deal with him. Looks like I should deal with each of you. Really? Will hit you all, without putting my hand and not placing my foot down. How dare you!!! You silly fellows, the fight has began. Hey, I got him.Pull his by his leg. come on guys. Hit him, hit him. [screaming in pain] hey, he put his leg down. He put his leg down. Shit, shit. He is not a normal guy, dude. Now tell me guys, You won't understand with words You guys really need this sound beating. Krishna quoted this in Bhagavad Gita, "Be playful but don't play with anyone" I never betray anyone but played my tricks. I just as same. Tell him not to betray anyone. - Will you tell him? - Yes brother, we will tell him. - Huh! - Brother kept his leg down! I think the hand's fractured, need to get a scan. Chaitu... Chaitu.. Where are you? He is not even at home. [Phone ringing] Hello. Accident!! Which hospital ? I am coming right away. It's okay How did this happen? Nothing has happened yet, Divya ? What are you talking about ? About our marriage. What am I asking and what are you answering ? Does your mind work? It's okay! - Where will go to honeymoon? In this situation that is the least (screaming with pain) sorry.. sorry..sorry. Is it paining ? Sorry, I am really sorry. Sarayu, Sarayu, You are here. We are not selling the house. All the problems are resolved. The problem has just began, Chaitu. Whom you are talking about ? About Uday. Uday? Uday, Uday, It's me. I am your Sarayu here. Hey dude, you are such a strong man. Inspite of the deadly accident you recovered in just 8 months. But, Sarayu has left us. Uday, I am here with you What are you saying ? Yes man, Sarayu died in the accident. Is Sarayu dead? I won't believe it. My Sarayu won't die, she won't die. [evil smile] You know who got her killed ? Uday. What are you saying ? Yes, I got her killed. She owns 100 crore. How can I let go? I thought he is a great lover and human, but never thought he would betray you. Is love an online game, to play the way we want ? Getting betrayed has become so common for girls. I loved him more than anyone. It's not the time to think of him. I gave all the wealth to foundation by trusting him. I thought lot of children would benefit from it. You are suffering for his mistake. It's not at all right, let's give what he deserves.

He is more dangerous than Shankuni in Maha Bharat. He does not deserve to live. Hey, what's with all this photos and sketches? Are you planning on a kidnap ? While we trying to solve a mystery. Tell her dude to don't talk rubbish in between. Will break your head, if you talk this way. - Dude Divya, Divya, let me explain. Where is she now? Right beside you. Don't be afraid, she won't do anything. We wake up for just a small nightmare, That night we forget to sleep, Such is the case sarayu’s life became a nightmare. The injustice done to her should never happen to anyone again. Let's do something quick dude. I am very angry at him. Courage will subside as we struggle with fear. Let's put a check to his game. Dude, shall we start our game ? Yes dude. It's revenge time. It will be very good, if this guy brings alcohol. Who are you man? Courier, sir. Courier? Yeah. Are you setting new trend here? why?

Oh!!! My clothes didn't dry. That is why am wearing pizza delivery dress. Leave it and sign here. My siganture in this early morning, good deeds will happen to you. As if you're someone next to Modi? You came here to say this? - You took the signature but where is my courier? - What happened? Ohh, I forgot in dress code confusion. - Take it. You got two jobs? How will someone survive here with one job? - Get lost! - Such a gross customer, early in the morning. He spoiled my mood. what is this ? The group of thieves by Sathya Movies. Hey Uday...Uday. Hey guys, I got a CD man. It has our names on it. - Look this! - What happened? People are losing humanity. People are losing humanity. We are getting likes and comments for emergency posts rather than funds. I was searching for you guys, we got a fund of rupees 10 lakhs. 10 lakhs??? That's awesome. Hey, it's just 10 lakhs. How would that be enough for our luxuries ? - It's from only one person dude. - One person? Who is that great personality ? Get the details. let's appreciate them. Sure dude. Dude, I gathered all the details.Her name is Sarayu, aged 25. She is an orphan but damn rich. She is as sentimental as her beauty. Very complicated. It'll take atleast 10 years to impress her. Sarayu garu, I don't know how to write poems to impress you. I don't know how to write poems to impress you. Keep this as one week rent. House will be yours for one week. I will take care of rest. Dear Swecha, How are you feeling now ? Its better now, brother. Please brother, don't kill me, please (x2) Hey, everything is going according to our plan. Kill her now. Who is that? Who is that? Who is the blacksheep among us? I have shared everything and taken good care of you. How dare you cheat us? Hey, Leave him. Why would we cheat you? We thought you truly loved Sarayu. We did not know until you revealed it. Why would we save you if we wanted to cheat you? Who could do this? Who? Our plan is grand success. Sarayu has transferred her properties to the foundation. Send me my share. Ask me if you want more money, but don't play games with me. I you want to cheat me, you're already aware of how cruel I am. God had punished me for what I have done to Sarayu. If you have come running to me in this hurry, I am sure there should be a problem. You used Sarayu's dream to your convenience and use. Atleast let her rest in peace. Now get lost. Who could it be? Boss, Do you have a lighter? This is for you. Who gave it ? Someone named Sarayu. Sarayu? Where? That way. Sarayu!! Sarayu!! Sarayu!! You said she's dead. Yes bro. We have cremated her too. Though she's alive, there's mere chance of knowing where we are. Knowing our whereabouts might me hard for humans, but not spirits. Kankamma!! Kanakamma!! Kanakamma!! Who is this Kanakamma?? My grandmother. Is she that powerful? Atleast I know my grandfather feared her. You cowards. No doubt. Sarayu has come as a ghost. I am leaving.I am leaving. I am... I am leaving. Hey... If anyone leaves from here, I will break their legs. Uday.. Sarayu's favourite bell! Just a ball bro. Just a cricket ball. Who are these crazy fellows playing cricket at such odd hour? I know how to handle you. Guys, you stay back. I'll deal with them. Uday, You too. Who the hell are you, assholes? He has escaped nicely. Wish I could too. Where are you going? I want to go to washroom bro. Shut up and sit down. Where would you go. Please be with me. You drink and also pour for me. This booze is so blant and useless. Hello, Why did you call me at this hour? Really? Did granny expire? (Crying) What happened bro? My grandmother died of headache. Who dies of headache? I mean heartache. How can you ask such silly questions when my grandmother is dead? Bro, even I'll come along. I like you granny very much. Hey! You shut up and sit down. How can you leave me and go away? I am bestfriend man. You are my friend.. Then put your phone on the table. Why do you need the phone? (Stammerring) Put your phone down. Yeah. You friendship is so great. I will stand against any ghost for you. Call that ghost. I'll take care of it. Hi Pushpam.

Wait, I am coming. Is she dead or alive? Is she dead or alive? Hey, Who are you? I have hurt you really bad. Who the hell are you? You have shown me my flashback? You have triggered my past and hurt my ego. I'll not spare any of you. This is for you. Who gave it ? Someone named Sarayu. Hey hero, you did not expect me here.Right? Your lover is now in my custody. Come and take her before I kill her. I am sharing you the location. Come if you have guts. Sign on these papers. I thought you hav come for the girl. Have you come here for property? Hey... give him what he want! Hey Director. Better leave or you'll get hard blows from me. I am the one who frightens not fears anyone. I am not kind-hearted to give up the property. I have trapped and killed many. Sarayu is just one of those. I thought of enjoying after getting the property. I will kill you. Do the sign Boys, Kill him. Sarayu, I have proposed to kill him then and there. But you said no. If we leave him now, He'll spoil many more lives. Who the hell are you talking to? Sarayu is dead long ago. She did not die when you killed her. She was waiting for me at your house believing the stories you said. She died when she came to know about your true colours. Atleast sign now and give her the property back. No. I won't Hey! Okay. I will sign. Sarayu, Let's go. Finally, it ended good. Is she here? Yeah, she is. Please forgive me Sarayu madam. I could not see you. Sorry chaithu. I have troubled you alot. If not for you, the property would not have gone to the trust. You have saved many lives. Thank you so much Bro, we are scared watching you. Please convey us what you're talking. She's saying sorry for beating you. It's okay Sarayu. Even ghosts are also loving us these days. She is beating me... She is beating me again. It's not her, it's me. Why? For calling her ghost. Sorry Ghost garu, Sorry Sarayu madam. Please forgive me. Stay Happy. She is leaving. Oh!!
