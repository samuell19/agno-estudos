Fuck. So where are we? One moment. No phones please. Come on. You know the rules. This is taking forever, I'm late for somethin' There's nothing more important than you covering your ass before you sign on this dotted line, so what it is that you late for, I'm sure it can wait. I gotta' take this. I am sorry. Have you thought about what we talked about the last time? Dominik's a grown man. I'm not his keeper. No, but he's you're his best friend and he'll listen to you. This is awkward, but he's hurting your career. It's because of him I have a career. Whatever it is you think you owe him, you repaid him years ago. He was irresponsible and unpredictable when he gave you those records on your wall. Why does it matter now? You know, music is a young man's game. No shit. You want to play in the game, you gotta' start making people happy. You can't be pulling this attitude. Fine, I'll talk to him. When? So, what'd I miss? We're done. Great, gotta jet. The longer you wait, the more money you lose. So what's so important you had to bolt the meeting? It's personal. Fisk is pissed. Ha, I could give a shit. You should give a shit, he gets us gigs. He's our employee. If it wasn't for us he'd be writing wills for blue hairs. Do you have any plans this weekend after the mix? I think so. Can you break them? Why would I? Call it a work retreat. We talking Cabo? The location is a surprise. Who's invited? You and me. Fine, send me directions. Better yet, come out with us tonight. Out where? Flats. I have no idea what that is. It's a fucking club, you twat. Drop the tweed jacket and come out with us. Who's going to finish the mix if I'm out at the club? If you want me to come on your little work retreat, you come to the club with me. Change out of that Whoa. So, where to? After party. Fuck, where's my fucking phone? E, where's my phone? I don't know. Give me yours I'm busy. Who is that guy? He's my button pusher, knob turner. Yeah, I was wondering. I thought he might be your personal assistant, like you know. Invaluable things, personal assistants. If I could find my bleedin' phone, I might call her up and ask her where this after party is. Eddie? What? Where the fuck we going? I'm going home. You two can do whatever the fuck you like. Sorry, he's not a morning person. He probably had a late night last night. Ah, it's not a problem, you got me for the day. So, you are gonna' miss poker tomorrow. I know. Oh, don't tell me you're getting tired of stealing my money. I'm paying you $1,400 an hour to fly us. Who's stealing from whom? Hey, I'm giving you the friends discount. Discount? Did you put the rendezvous point in your GPS? Yep. Your phones won't work. You wannna borrow my SAT phone? It'll be fine. Look, it's rough terrain, just take it, huh? I'll sleep better. This is him. I guess he brought a friend Five hours. Five hours is not bad. No, no, and then I get home and then you're gone, 'cause you're out partying with that British dude who you've never even introduced me to, Whatever. What's up, we late? It's fine, James, this is Dominik, my partner. Hey. And this is? Lora, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you Nice to meet you. Lora. Hi, Lora. Hi. Are we all going? I thought you said there was just going to be two passengers. Yeah. When I said it was a work retreat, I thought it was going to be the two of us. Uh, that's my fault, I asked if I could come. Her fault. What's the problem man, look there's room. Sure. May I take your bags, miss? Oh, why thank you. It was supposed to be just the two of us. I know man, she's been bothering me to spend more time with her, so I figured, you know, kill two birds. So where to, captain? Let's find a place to camp. Camp? Christ. Did you think we were going to find a day spa out here? A man can hope. Why haven't you changed your clothes, at least the shoes? Didn't really have time, we were till what, six or seven? I don't know, it was fucking late. We threw some shit in our bags and here we are. So you haven't slept? Fuck man, relax. Yeah relax, it's vacation. Or something like that. There's a clearing up here, we can set up camp. It's not far from a river. Tell me you brought two tents. I brought two tents, okay? God. So we're here for a few days. What's the plan? No plan, no agenda. Woo, no complaints from me. You married, Eddie? Ha, he's divorced. Awe, spending time with two attractive single men. That sounds like a party. Mmm, that smells great. Just sticking a brat, help yourself. Thanks. You don't happen to have a six pack in that magic duffel bag of yours do you? Six pack of water. Did you bring anything to drink, baby? Like a fucking boy scout. Yes. Oof, what is this, kerosine? Try some, you'll like it. Mm-hmm. So what is this place? The North. You know what she means. Why here? It's remote. I used to go camping when I was a kid, with my dad, you know? Out here? No, back home, back east. When you're off the grid you got less distractions. That's why you were giving me the evil eye in the helicopter, I'm a distraction. He's right, you do distract me. Even in this sweatshirt. I'm sorry, Lora, this isn't a party. This is work, your man should have left you at home. Ouch. Hey, show some respect for my guest. You're right. Lora, this isn't your fault. Dominik just made a poor decision. Do you mind if I join you? Please. Sorry I haven't been a more gracious host. I was raised to have better manners. It's okay, I won't tell your mother. Besides, he can drive me nuts too. Is he sleeping? Yeah, he cashed out. I don't know how many days he's been awake. How's he find time to work? Exactly. He gets it done though. I suppose. If he frustrates you so much then why you still his partner? Long story. Does it look like I have anywhere to go? I'm a captive audience. 15 years ago or more, we were unknowns, Dominik meets this girl in a bar. Of course. It was Sadie. Oh right, you produced her her first album. That's right. Yeah, she was shopping around for producers at the time, relative unknown herself, but she had the financial backing of a major, which meant... Money. More money than we were used to, so we listened to her demos and they were amazing, but when we met her, Dominik sort of lied and said they were total crap and I guarantee you no one ever talked to her like that before. She seemed like she was about to cry. But, I think part of her respected him for it. Why did he lie? I don't know. Following his instincts I guess. He knew if we didn't set ourselves apart from other producers, we wouldn't get the gig. So she sucked up her pride and asked him what he would do different. And? He said, "Give us 24 hours," and he whipped up Dark Days. In 24 hours? Well, the backbone of it. He was a machine. He's got a gift. Well, he's got something Isn't it a little early for that? Go back to sleep. Morning. Morning, man. You still pissed? I'm not pissed. It's just why couldn't you take this retreat seriously? I like Lora and all, but it's not supposed to be a party. What did Fisk say to you? It's not Fisk, Dominik. The phones haven't been ringing the way they used to, LRG was two years ago and that's an eternity in the pop world. Hey, we'll survive. We won't unless we adapt. Morning, boys. Kids adapt to me, I set the fucking trends, E. Listen to yourself. Okay, you know what. If we're gonna be here all weekend long together, you two better fucking lighten up. So, what is there to do around here? Well, we got the woods all around us. Let's explore, I'm game. Babe? Whatever. I found this path yesterday. Oh, is this an animal trail? No, it's too defined. Who the fuck else would be out here? Hunters. Is it hunting season? Not for deer, but for other animals maybe. They said there would be anyone around this time of year. Who said that? The state, I just bought it. What, this land? Yeah. All of it Jesus dude, why? It's beautiful. It's nature. They told me there's a waterfall on it somewhere. Oh my gosh, what's it called? I don't know. Can we see it? I have no idea where it is unfortunately. Of course, the one fucking thing I'd want to see. Okay, all right, tomorrow morning, we'll wake up bright and early, go for another hike and find the waterfall, if you behave. Fat chance. Listen. No ringing, no buzzing, nothing electrical. Peace. Jesus. No clubs, no bars, no computers. I get it now, is this an intervention? You know, some people do actually enjoy going camping and spending time outdoors. It's not so bad. See? Yeah. My ray of sunshine. Oh my God, we're gonna sleep really well tonight. Isn't it time for lunch? Yeah, shit man. I hope you brought more food than this. This will work. Work for what? Maybe I will catch us dinner. You're such a goddamn nerd. You know you can join me if you want. I could probably fashion a rod out of a tree branch, I brought extra line. We could be in Cabo. Don't tease. Who's teasing? So, where did you two meet? We were roommates in college. He's always been kind of like a brother, you know? You seem to be in a better mood. It's the afternoon, I'm finally awake. I think it's more than that. Don't analyze me. Don't bully me. I think Eddie was right. This place really kind of cools you out. This is fine for a few hours, but I'm sure I'm gonna' be pulling my hair out by the end of the week. And he was also right that I shouldn't be here. You know what, fuck him, he was cryptic. He didn't give me any ground rules. I know, what is done is done, I'm here. I'm just saying the two of you should at least get some alone time, you know? Alone time? You know what I mean, I saw you guys banter back there. It was like you were old friends and now you're away from all that music. I feel like it just might work. What might work? Eddie's not an idiot. He chose this place because he knows that it'll help him reconnect with you again. Did he tell you this? No, but what do you think a work retreat is for? I dunno' to expense laps, dinners, and hookers. It's like talking to a brick wall. You asked, hey. Hey, come on, what are you pissed? I'm fine. You're just exhausting sometimes. What? What is it? I smell something. Is there a punchline coming? No, it's... You don't smell that? Yeah, I think I do. I think it's coming from over here. All right, I lost it. The wind changed. That's not the wind. Do you hear that? Yeah. Come on let's go see who's making that noise. Hey, these people live in the fucking woods, Lora, I don't think they want to be disturbed. Oh come on, don't be a pussy. Woah. Look, someone is living here. Look, right there. I see it, it's a fucking house. That's a pretty harsh chemical smell. Come on, we should leave. Dano. Jesus, he's got a gun. That's fine, everybody out here is gonna' be packing. No, let's get the fuck out of here. Dano. Hey. Hey yourself. Who are you people. Who the fuck are you? You're squatting here. Sorry, we don't need to be rude. Squatting, what the hell you talking about? Uh, there's no need for that, we'll just be on our way. That's not gonna happen. Why? Time to go, Lora. Lora? What an average name. Sorry to bother you, we'll just be going now. Oh, you're not going anywhere, especially not you. Come here, let me get a better look at you. Dano. Over here. Come on. Stop, hey stop! What was that? Don't move, you're next. What happened? Some hikers took the wrong path. How many? Just this guy and the girl. You sure? Yeah. You got any friends we need to worry about? Answer me! What the fuck, is he a retard or somethin'? Are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. Was that so fucking hard? Go tell Seth, I'll take care of this one. Where did the bitch and the backstreet boy come from? I don't know. They just slipped up. You know we're gonna' catch hell for this, don't ya? You don't have to tell anybody. What is this mess? You got everything laid out here, but someone can walk up on. Fuck. Morning, sunshine. What have you done? Now you're on the floor. Pick him up. What you want to do with him? Looks like an idiot. Just look at his clothes. Yeah. What are you doing up here, pretty boy. He's seen the operation. Kill him. Wait, wait, wait, you moron I don't want little pieces of brain littering my cellar. First, grab the girl, dig a big hole, six feet down, then take him outside. Put two bullets in his head. Don't drag ass. I want the situation cleaned up before Big Em gets here. Yeah boss, wait, Big Em is comin'? Help him. Hop to it. Just wasn't your day. Banks. Yeah? Get this clean. I don't want any trace of the girl or that asshole in there. After you're done I want you to search the area. I know he said they were alone, but others are sure to come looking for them. Okay. Banks. Nothing leads them back here, do you understand? Understood. All right, I'm back. Miss me? Oh, can I get you anything, coffee? Ho ho? My boy, Banks, makes a mean beef jerky. You like beef jerky? Ah, I get it, you're missing your girl. I miss her too. I'm gonna be missing her all night. You eying that machete over there? Here, let me help ya. Oh shit. Go on. Get it. I took off my gun, see? Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Here, let me help you some more. Come on, you got it. Come on, it's right there. I'll turn my back. Oh, oh, duh, duh, duh. Huh. No? Damn, all right. No fun and games today. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere. Hey. What? Ignorant motherfucker. There's more guys, I know, I know. We have to hurry. Come on. Come on, man. What is it? My ankle. Come on, go. They killed Lora. I saw. They'll kill us too if we don't get moving. Come on. What the fuck happened? They got away. They? They who? There was another guy. You said it was just the guy and the girl. I was wrong. I clipped one of them. He jumped in the river. Why didn't you pursue? They won't last, bleeding, cold, now wet. Get a radio, go find them and give me regular updates. Finish this. Yeah, boss. Let me take a look at you. Dom? Dom, stay with me, man. This will keep you warm. Come on, we gotta get going. Come on, we gotta go, gotta go. Let's stop here for a second. What the fuck were you thinking? What? With this weekend. I don't know. I mean, why are we here and who are those fucking guys? Look, I thought this space would be ours, okay? I thought we could spend some time together and work out some shit. She's fucking dead, Eddie and we're fucking lost. We're not lost. Then where are we? I didn't shoot her, okay? All we can do now is try to survive the night. I'm sure those assholes are out there looking for us. Thanks for the bandage. It's not gonna last. We need a real med kit, some new bandages, and a way to close the wound. Can you make it up a tree? Okay. Just try to rest up for a while, okay? I'm thirsty. Keep it, keep it. You know, I wasn't even gonna come. She had to talk me into it. Figured we were going to that studio in Cabo. She was so excited. Those fucking assholes are gonna pay. We got to get to the SAT phone and call in the cavalry. Just try to be quiet for a second. Fuck. What was your name again? Dominik. Hello, Dominik, do you remember mine? Of course. Then what is it? Why the test? Because I don't think you're being honest. At least I was being honest. You are the girl from the bar. Asshole It's Lora, with an O. Yeah, what's my last name? You didn't tell me. Oh. You're probably right. Well? Well what? What the fuck's your last name? Well you got me all nervous now. Boyne Lora Boyne? What? Yes, Boyne, it's Irish. It means foolish, which seems pretty appropriate for right now. Lora Boyne. My name is Lora with an O and I ain't your average ho. Last name is Boyne. Make you feel good in your groin. That needs work. Are you sure you write songs? When can I see you again? This is over? I thought we were just getting started. Eddie? Eddie? Fuck. Find anything? No. God damnit. Hey. Hey. Where'd you go? I went back to camp. They were there. No med kit? No med kit. Let me help you down, think I found a better spot. We can at least stay warm for a few moments, maybe try to dry out our clothes. How you feel? Cold, dizzy. God, you're sweaty, feverish. I should probably take a look at your wound. We're gonna have to take the bullet out. I don't think that's necessary. Just do it. Please. How? With that knife. You sure? How hard can it be, right? You still have that flask? Check your bag. It's almost full. Yeah. We didn't have a whole lot to celebrate yesterday. You're gonna' need it. You too. You sleepy? Yeah, well I stood guard all night. Bullshit. How would you know? I heard you snoring like my Pa Pa. Your what? My grandpa. Man, the less you talk the better. What, It's not my fault those hikers found us. No, but you let that one escape. His friend blindsided me. Oh shit. This ain't gonna' be good. You think Big Em knows I let that guy go? Take one guess. I don't know. Well, take my fucking advice, keep your mouth shut. How many are we looking at? Two escaped. Who are they? Probably hikers. Do they have any phones, radios? I don't know, but who doesn't have a phone? Yeah, but there's no way they're getting any service out here. That's why this spot is perfect for us. But if you don't silence them, your perfect spot will be swarming with feds Emma, I'm not going to move. It took me two years to find this place and get it running. Do you want to build another lab or spend the rest of your life in Lompoc? We wouldn't be making product. I know. So let's see if we can resolve this first. Ever see the inside of a cat? The inside. You're a friggin moron, aren't ya? You're psycho. I'm not. Why the hell you... Shut up. So last night, tell me some good news. We found the camp. Yes, and? They weren't there. Where are they? I don't know. The girl? I buried her. That won't do. What, you want me to dig her up? You said bury her. Change of plans. This is bullshit. Help him. Okay. Not so fast. Which one of you let the guy go? What do you mean? Who was watching the hostage when he escaped? Well, he had a friend. So it was you. Well yeah, but he had a friend hiding though. Get another body bag. This is Civil War era medicine. Hell, Peloponnesian. What the fuck you talking about? Can't be worse than when I got my Prince Albert, right? Had your fill? Get me up, pass me a stick for my mouth. And bite. It's okay, it's okay. Stick at least. Okay. Here we go. Just a second. Gonna get the bullet now. I gotta' dig in there man, hold on. Okay. Okay, a little bit longer. Here comes the fun part here. All right, here we go. Oh, fuck! Thanks, man. Hey, you're gonna' have a hell of a scar, but the bleeding should stop. What do we know of these people? Two men. That's it? That's it. How did they get here, by car, chopper, on foot? I didn't see a car at the camp. Well maybe they drove it away before you arrived. Drove where? There's no roads, those no anything for miles. We drive in. On an ATV, on a path detailed by me. I chose this place specifically for its remote location. It's clearly not remote enough. I looked for tire tracks, nothin', they walked in. They couldn't have gone far. Especially if you clipped one. Yeah, he might be dead already. Where were they headed? Down this river. So, you have a serious injury, you're on foot, you're scared, you're miles away from any civilization. Where would you go? This is your haunt, Seth. You scouted this terrain. Where would you go? Get my rifle. This is where they went in. All right, looks like we're getting wet. Shit. We're crossing. Where? About a half mile from the lab. Good. Now check out that cabin and be fucking discreet. They're in there. Take the front entrance, I'll move around the side in case there's a rear exit. They're gone. What do you mean they're gone? You just said you saw them. They must have just left, their fire is still warm. Find them. Fuck. Couldn't have got far. Look for tracks. Which way did they go? Come on we gotta move. Don't slow down. How's your leg? Fine. I think we're in the clear. Just keep going. You're falling behind. You need to work on your endurance. I said I'm fine. What? What'd you say? I'm not sure. You look dazed. You don't have the blood to do a sprint. Just give me a second. I can walk at least. Okay. I don't see them, but we still have to find a place to hold up before the rendezvous. Come on! I've lost them. I got 'em. They're too far. Shut up. Leave it, leave it. It's got our stuff. I know what's in it, come on. Don't lose them, go. Keep your radio on. Let's get the gun. Leave it, leave it, leave it, there could be more following, come on. Where are we going? South, I think. Why? First, it's away from the men with guns and second it's toward our rendezvous. Where's the GPS? It's gone. Where? In the river, in the hut, I don't know. See, we should have gone back for the gun. It wasn't worth the risk. We're lost, we're soaked, we've got no food, no phone, we've got nothing. Just stick with me for like 18 more hours, okay? Nah, I'm going back. No. You're not in charge, E. We just hiked like three miles. These assholes have dictated everything because they have guns and we don't, I'm done running. We gotta' stick together. Then come with me, don't argue. I'm going. No, you're not going back. Don't fucking touch me. We can't split up. Back the fuck off. You back the fuck off. You're such a fucking child. You always have to get your way. If I had my way we'd be in Cabo. Sure, so you could blow the rest of your money. Okay, Dad. You want to know why we're here, why the work retreat? Fisk begged me to talk some sense into you because you're destroying both of our careers. So you're Fisk's errand boy now. I thought you were mine. I set up this whole weekend because I was trying to reconnect with you, but I'm out. What do you mean out? I quit. I'm done. I'm done with music. You're the most talented person I know, but I can't deal with you anymore, man. I thought I was sick of the music industry, but it turns out I'm just sick of you. Fine, you've been dead weight for years. Seth? What? What's your status? No news yet. Why isn't Banks responding? I don't know, he took off after them. As he should, why didn't you follow? I did. I am. Find, them, deal with this, or don't come back. It's my fucking lab, Emma, I'm in as deep as you. It is your fucking lab, Seth. That's why this whole fucking fuck up is your fucking responsibility, you fuck. Seth, kindly give me your location. Why? Because I'm coming out there. That's not necessary, we can handle it. Well that time has passed, I'm on my way. You're staying here. We know nothing about these men. You could be putting yourself at risk. I don't trust this misfit crew to run a garage sale let alone a manhunt, so I've gotta go. You pack up the remaining product and in the morning, torch the place, torch it all. Come on, where's you gun? A phone. You get the text, right? Then you gotta' go to the place. It's a different place every single time, right? They're not gonna let anybody just in right, so you gotta' show them the text, you gotta' knock first right, three times. You gotta' have special glasses. It's the best sushi you're ever gonna' have. Sounds fishy. Keep em' coming. Your wish is my command. Yeah, she's hot. She's all right. Man, she likes you. Yeah, but she likes my hundred dollar bills more. Sounds like any woman. What are you two talking about? He just called you a gold digger. Man. What? Then why do I always pay, asshole. You see what you just did? Just drink up, man, it's on me. Hey. Cheers. Hey, I see you started without me. We started at noon. Everybody, this is Callie. Callie, this is everybody. Hi. Hi. We've met. So martinis all around, huh? We're celebrating. What's the special occasion? Holy shit, you didn't. He did. I did. Well, congratulations, it's beautiful. Thank you. I am going to go find the lady's room, so I'll be back, vodka tonic? Sure. Thanks. I guess I've been out of the loop for a while. We just tell people in person, we don't post or do any weird shit like that. Hey. Hey. So you and Callie know each other? Yeah. That's weird, she didn't mention anything. I'm not surprised. Why? It was kind of a one nighter. Sorry man, figured you'd want to hear it from me first. Yeah, yeah I get it. So you guys like serious? I don't know, it's early. She's hot. Yeah. And a fucking rockstar in the sack. But you know that already. Wait. You haven't hit that yet? Like I said, it's early. Jesus, dude. You know, if I were you, keep an eye on it. A girl like that would tap a stranger in the bathroom. Hey, where is she anyway? Shut up, man. I'm just giving you shit. You're in for a treat. What can I get you? Two vodka tonics. Fuck, I can't see. Oh, sorry. I didn't think you were going to be here today. Session got canceled. Dom? Of course. I don't know why you put up with that guy. Yeah. Were you sleeping? Nope. Good, I, um, just came to get the rest of these things, then I'll be out of your hair. Take your time. I know that this has been really hard for us, for you, but I just wanted to say thanks for being an adult about it. Bye. I think that's everything. I left my address on the notepad in the kitchen, so if you find anything you can always send it there. Or you can just come pick it up. Yeah. Goodbye, Eddie. What? Wake up, where are they? Back there. So they're still alive? Yes. What about Banks? I don't know. He's dead? Or ran away. So two dumb ass hikers took down your top henchmen? Maybe. Do they have a gun? I don't think so. They might now. Fuck. And you're napping. You realize they could have killed you in your sleep. You were easy enough to track down. You're underestimating them. I've been out here all night, where have you been? Oh, what? You gonna hit me? Would you hit my father? No. But you'll hit a girl. You're no girl. Oh, I'm not? What am I? Huh. You're, you're my boss. Goddamn right, I'm your boss. I will hit you and insult whenever I goddamn like. No, no. Let me spell something out for you and I'll speak slowly because you're still groggy from waking up. I run 14 operations. Do you know what that makes this place? One out of fucking 14. If we're so unimportant, then why are you here? Because these hikers may expose us and a lady doesn't like to be exposed. Now lead the fucking way. Where are they going? This was their general direction, south. We need more than that, get your map. There's not much around here, they're trapped, surrounded by wilderness. They had to arrive somehow. Their exit plan is probably by the same route they arrived. There was no ATV or jeep at their camp. Any tracks? No tire tracks, Banks assured me. There's no way they walked here. They had to fly in. That's the only option. So you're a client flying in wealthy clients. Where's your drop off? There are several clearings within their walk radius. Speculate. Fuck. Put the binoculars away. Get out your rifle. I can't line up a shot. You're just wasting bullets. So put it away! Forget it, we'll follow him. So he did have a gun. Where are you going? He's gone. We can't be sure. Even if he survived the fall, there's no way of tracking him. You should follow him. Over the cliff? Maybe you should. I gave you a fucking order. And I fucking say no. Are we gonna do this little dance again? Talk all you want, threaten all you want, but you need me and you need the lab. Do you know how much I need your lab? Your baby, it's gone. Before I left to find you I gave the order to burn it down. You're right. We're compromised and we have a witness at large. We need to find his exit route, but I can guarantee you it wasn't over that goddamn cliff. Dom? Dom, where are you? Dominik? Dominik! Put him in your sights. But it's too fucking bumpy. Why do you whine like a little girl, take him down. Is he down? No. God, you're so fucking useless. Stop! You put up a good fight, now it's over. Not so useless now, bitch. Drop it. Drop it, I'm not gonna say it again. Hi there. Hey, hey. Where's your ride? What ride? How are you planning on leaving/ We were gonna stay a month. Bullshit, who's coming to get you and why'd you split from your friend? He wanted to go find a gun. From Banks? I don't know. Don't know what? Who's Banks? The marginally effective gorilla chasing you earlier, you remember him now? I hit him with a rock. Where? At the river, he probably drowned. Shit. You're coming with me. Come on. Come on, come on. Now, I am gonna have a chat with your pilot. Stay here, or the pilot dies. In case you get any second thoughts. I feel much better now. Hi. Hi, can I help you? I hope so, I need some help over here. Yeah, what sort of help? I can't explain, just come with me. Where's Eddie? Eddie? I can't say. I got a real problem over here, there's not much time. Yeah, who are you? Stop.
