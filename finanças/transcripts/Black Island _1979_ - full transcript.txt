-Right, you lot, everybody out. Follow me. Come on. This way. Everybody over here. And get your jam jars out. And you've all got jam jars, have you? [INAUDIBLE] Yep, same size. Joe! Come here. Oy, pay attention. And now we're going to have the insect hunt in pairs. Right, we're going to split you two up. Right, off you go. I want you to go with Michael. -Oh, no. Not with him. -Now do as I say. Come on. Off you go. I want you all back in and hour. One hour. And no one to go any further than the woods over there or the fence over there. Did you hear? -Hey look, a butterfly! -Hey. -The butterfly's gone. I bet there's crabs here. -Fancy a ride? -It's full of water. -Frightened to get your feet wet? Chicken. -I'm not a chicken. Stupid, it's full of water and we've gotta get back. -Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. Can't you take a joke? You don't have to come. -Now has anyone seen Joe [INAUDIBLE] or Michael Wilson? [GROUP MUTTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Michael! -Come on. In you go. [INAUDIBLE] it's none of your business. In you get. Come on. Hurry up. In you get. -Help! Help! Help! Help! [MUSIC PLAYING] -I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, I gave them strict instructions not to go too far. -All right, sir. Don't worry. We'll find them. Right, lads. Spread out. Don't worry, sir. -Hello? Is anyone there? [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me? [MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey! -I thought you were dead. -Me too. -[INAUDIBLE] look horrible. -You don't look too good yourself. You're still wet. -A bit. -I've got a fire going. -I know. I saw the smoke. -Come on. Let's go and get dry. -You're right. Bet you were scared. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Being all alone. [INAUDIBLE] -I wasn't hiding. It was burning all nicely half an hour ago. -Can't you light it again? -I'll have a go. I was looking forward to getting nice and warm. It's soaking wet. -I never put water on it. -Couldn't have been anybody else, could it? -There's a shed by that [INAUDIBLE]. It's full of stuff. -What do you mean? Food? -Could be. -Didn't you look? -It's locked. I couldn't get in. -Bet I could. Yeah. Yeah, show me. -We need something stronger. Let's look in the barn. -You go. I'll [INAUDIBLE] out here. -Let's both go. -After you. -Come on. It's just an old barn. This will do it. -Great. [INAUDIBLE] -[INAUDIBLE]. -Shh. -What? -Thought I heard something. -Come on. Let's get that door open. It's a boat! -Oy! -Run for it! [MUSIC PLAYING] -They've gone. -I think I'm gonna be sick. -Shh. Gotta get out of this place quick. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on! If you hadn't been so clever. -Me? -Yeah, you and your stupid shed. --[INAUDIBLE] I didn't try to break in. -You helped. -It was your idea. -Wasn't. -Was. -Shut up. -You shut up. [MUSIC PLAYING] -They can't get off the island. Let's let them sweat it out, eh? -How are we gonna fix it together? -See if you can find some more wood. I'll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. Will you come on? Wait here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] paddles. -Oh, that's great. Just great. [MUSIC PLAYING] Look. Help! -Help! -Help! -Help! -Help! -Help! -Help! -[INAUDIBLE] break your neck. -[INAUDIBLE]! -It's all right, mate. Kids just playing a game. [INAUDIBLE], what's your little game, eh? -Nothing. Honest. -Was I talking to you? Shut up. Do you know who this belongs to? This island, eh? It belongs to us, me and him. It's our island, our property. Follow me? Right, so what you doing here? Eh? Who invited you? Who asked you here? Don't all shout at once! What you doing here, eh? -Take it easy, Jack. -How did you get here, son? -It was an accident. I'm sorry. It wasn't our fault. -All right. All right. -We were on a boat. And it tipped up. It was an accident. -Anyone else know you're here? -No, sir. -Well, that's something, isn't it? -And what are we gonna do? -We're gonna take them home with us, George. That's what we're gonna do. Come on. In here. Here. How'd you get that fire lit? Oh. Regular little Boy Scouts, aren't we? [GLASS SHATTERING] Go on. Get down there. And you. Safest place in all England and what do we find? A couple of kids. -Wonder if they'll give us anything to eat. -Ask them. -You ask them. -You, share that. -I wonder if could have something to eat. -Shut up and get round there. Right. Up here. Come on. No listen, you're going on five minutes run about. OK? You come straight back in here. I don't wanna have to come looking for you. Go on. -Hey, Jack? -What? -Get a a couple of tins of grub, will you? -Yeah, all right. -What does he mean run about? -Just stretch our legs, I think. -[INAUDIBLE] light a fire. Maybe somebody would see the smoke. -He'd see it first. He'd go mad. -Oy! Whatcha up to? Oy! Boys! -[INAUDIBLE]. Get off there! Get off! -[INAUDIBLE]. -George! [GROANING] -[INAUDIBLE]. -George! George! Do you think we're stupid or something? -It's all right, Jack! All right. You can't blame them for trying. -I'm gonna kill him, George! I'm gonna kill him! -Jack! Jack, Jack! A fine mess we'll be in with two dead kids on our hands. -I'm starving. -Rice pudding? -Did you pinch it? -Gave it to me. -Who? -The old one. -What for? -Don't know. Just did. -[INAUDIBLE] go careful, George. How many we got left? -About half a dozen. -We're on our last two cans of grub, hardly any matches left. What a filthy mess. -What about having another go of trying to get away from here? -Depends how. -In a dingy tomorrow. -OK. -Well, that's the last of the grub we're gonna see for a bit. -I'm off, George. -If they get up to anything, thumb them. -Here. And say you won't give me any trouble. -Where's he gone? -'Round the island. Make sure there's no more cast aways. [CLEARS THROAT] -Do you know how to work this? -No. -Where's the kids? -Huh? -Where are they? -Hey? Lads? -You stupid idiot! [YELLING] -Come on, George! I've got them! Find your way out of that and I'll break your neck. I thought we were running out of matches. -Jack, how about I take the boat to the mainland and knick some grub? -You must be joking. It'd be crawling with coppers over there looking for them kids. -Well, how're we gonna live? On water? -If we have to, yeah. -No, we're gonna have to pack it in, Jack. -Pack it in? Pack it in? Have you forgotten what prison's like? Eh? -Well, at least the meals are regular. -It's a big risk. Let's try it. Right. Which one of you wants to go? -I'll go. -Right. You. -Try and write a message to somebody. -Come here. Now pay attention. You and George and gonna get some grub. Only George being a bit shy doesn't wanna meet anybody, so you'll have to do the knicking. OK? And if you have any naughty notions about not coming back, number one, George will be [INAUDIBLE] and number two, if I see any trouble your little friend there will be a very dead little friend. Got it? -[INAUDIBLE]. Keep down, will you? What do you think you are? A [INAUDIBLE] lighthouse? Oh, what a piece of luck. Now use your [INAUDIBLE] and get as much as you can carry. -You little devil! -I need help! I wasn't [INAUDIBLE], honest. -What are you doing in here? -[INAUDIBLE]. -You're knicking [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Oh! [PHONE RINGING ON LINE] OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Emergency. Which service do you require? -Police. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): What's happened, sir? -I've just been robbed. Couple of minutes ago. A man and a boy, filthy, dirty, they were. -Not a word about the bloke in the van, OK? Never saw no one. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Sorry, Jack. It's like a desert over there. There's no houses, no people, no nothing. -Well, don't just sit there. And you, come on. -How much longer do you think we can stick this out, Jack? -Well, what would you have us do, eh? Go back to prison for another 10 years? -How long before we starve? -You'll find as soon enough, son. -What's that? -Weeds. -They're not. They're potato leaves. -What'd you say? -There's raw potatoes under there. -Hey, look at that. Come on you two, get [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. Dig! -Well, if it was a rowing boat they'd be side of the water. If it was motor boat they could be anywhere. Let's go and get the river police. -[INAUDIBLE]. MAN (ON RADIO): Man and boy robbed a grocer's van. [INAUDIBLE]. Last seen heading towards the beach. The locals think they got away in a boat. [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. They could be almost anywhere by now. Trouble is, we don't know what sort of boat to look for. All right, [INAUDIBLE]. -All right. That'll do. Stick them in there. And get back out of the way. Matches. -Only one left. -Give it here. There's no gas. Go and get another canister. -That was the last one. -You stupid idiot. -We could light a fire. Small one. -What? Without any matches? -It's not my fault! -Who said we'd be all right on an empty island, eh? Who said no one else would find us? -Oh, get off! -Who said we'd be nice and cozy in a cellar? Eh? -Me teeth! Me teeth! -[INAUDIBLE]. useless. -I could light a fire. -What? How? -With two bits of wood. -You're joking. -No, I can, honestly. I need a hard bit and a soft bit. -Bet it'll be a trick, son. -You rub them together. I've done it hundreds of times. -OK. Show me. -You've gotta get the right wood and takes a while. We haven't got any water. We'll need water to boil them in. -All right, Einstein. You stay here and light the fire. [INAUDIBLE] and me will get the water. Pick them up. I only want a little fire, mind. No smoke, George. -He's gonna be back in a minute. I've got it. -What's that? -Petrol from the boat. Go and get some more wood. -Hey, be careful! -Where's Jack with that water? -Taters in their jackets! We could bake them! I'll get some with their skins on. Hey! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Birds nests. It's full of birds nests, the chimney. And they've all caught fire. Go get some water! -We haven't got any! [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] -What's going on? -[INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] You've done it this time! -It wasn't my fault! -Let's get the boat out before sees this lot! -Where do you think the pump is, eh? -That would be them, I suppose. [MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLING] -Hey! Are you all right, boys? -Hello, George. -Hello, lad. -It's yours. -You gonna stay there all day? [MUSIC PLAYING]
