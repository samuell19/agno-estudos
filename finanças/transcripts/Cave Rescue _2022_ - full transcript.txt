[tense music playing] [air tank hissing] [grunting] [groans] Fuck. Oh, shit. [grunts] [kids chattering indistinct] [speaking Thai] [kids exclaiming] [whistle blows] [cheering] [kids chattering] [chattering] [tense music playing] [thunder rumbling] [announcer on broadcast speaking Thai] [horn blares] [radio chatter in Thai] [gasps] [coughing] [clucking and crowing] [man on PA] [chattering in Thai] [tense music playing] [engine rumbling] [chattering in Thai] [siren blaring] - Nice to meet you, sir. - Good to meet you, too, sir. You should get these people here, immediately. [phone ringing] - Hi. - Rob, I'm here with the Thai Ministry of Tourism. - He would very much like to speak with you. - Thank you. Hello, Rob. I'm calling you on behalf of Thai government. This gentlemen here tells me you're a cave diving expert. That's right. What happened? I, uh, I actually just got back from Thailand. We have a problem. Some kids have disappeared in a cave. [indistinct chatter on TV] [man] Morning, Lieutenant. - Morning, sir. - What's the status? This cable came in from our embassy in Bangkok this morning. Okay, warm up 353 SOG at Kadena. - Pass it on to the major. - Roger that. Are we on? I am live outside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai. We've been following the story of the disappearance June 23rd of the Wild Boars football team. There's 12 teenaged boys and their 24-year-old coach. All we really know so far is that late on the afternoon of June 23rd, they went up this road and into this cave, and that's the last time they were seen. Whether they're still alive is really anyone's guess. And people here are hoping and praying for a miracle. We'll continue to bring you updates as they occur. For Khaosod English this is Todd Ruiz in Chiang Rai. [chattering] - [siren chirps] - [whistle blowing] General. [in English] The general has asked his team to brief you on the situation. [in Thai] This is the first point where we found all their bicycles and shoes. Okay. And the second point we found all their bags. - How far is it between the two points? - Four kilometers. Okay, are now those completely flooded, or is there-there any air in through here? Where are you with that? All from here to here we have to dive. If we believe that they're right here, is there another entrance? Is there any other way so that we're not having to follow this long path? Cannot. No way. Only one way we get in. And how long 'til that floods? This is where the Wild Boars team entered the cave. And this is where we believe them to be now. That's if they are still alive. Okay, so if they've been in there for longer than 72 hours in those conditions, realistically, what's their chance of survival? This whole area behind us is Nang Non Mountain. And when it rains heavily, we get the water coming out here. And then it goes out towards that pond over there. We're moving water from 13 ground water-wells all around here. But if we keep getting rain like this, then I don't know if we can keep up. [tense music playing] [chattering in Thai] - Good to see you, mate. - [man] Great to see you. John. [mutters] Rick. - [man 1] How was your journey? - [man 2] Not too bad. Listen, when can the guys get into dive? [man] Thai Navy SEALs are down there. And they said the currents are too strong. We're going to have to maybe wait. Well, let's take a look, shall we? [thunder rumbles] [phone ringing] [reporter on TV speaking Chinese] [in Chinese] [Major Hodges] Thai authorities have not allowed us to dive yet. [translator speaking Thai] [Major Hodges] They have no way of knowing where the kids are. [translator speaking Thai] [speaking Thai] Sorry, no have. [door closes] [in English] Excuse me, sir. Where are you from? Mr. Tan Xiaolong is from Peaceland Foundation, Beijing. He's a cave diving instructor. [speaking Chinese] - You're a side-mount instructor? - Yeah, yeah. [in English] I need to learn that. Yeah. - [translator] Mm. - Yeah. Come with me, I'll introduce you to the guys. Thank you, thank you. [TV reporter speaking Thai] [phone vibrating] Hello. [birds squawking] [dramatic music playing] [air hisses] [metal clanging] [beeping] - Will I lead? - Yeah. - We go left at the junction, yeah? - [mutters] [man] Jim, have you seen this? Hey. Oh. Oh, Jesus. That's an accident waiting to happen. See those lads, they only have single cylinders on their back. In cave diving you usually wear two cylinders. Those guys are not geared up for cave diving. Then why don't you go to Thailand and pull those kids out of the cave? - [chuckles] - Jim'll fix it, eh? [man chanting in Thai] [clicking] [man on radio] Thai authorities have now called in cave rescue divers from the international community to help with efforts to locate the children. Thai Navy SEALs are leading the rescue efforts. But continuing rainfall and strong currents inside the cave, have prevented them from making any progress to find the missing boys so far. [tense music playing] [text message alert] [door opens, closes] - Hey. - Hi. - How was your day today? - Oh, not too bad. Um... what would you think if I go to Thailand? [chuckles] Why would you go to Thailand? To go and help those kids in the cave. There's so many people over there already. [mutters softly] [in Thai] [in English] These are the best cave divers in the world. There's no one else like them. No. Sorry, cannot dive. [in Thai] [in English] He doesn't want to take responsibility for your safety because of the water levels. Look, you've got these guys over here. You need to let them do their job. [in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [birds chirping] [chattering in Thai] [phone ringing] [speaking Chinese] Okay. So, you use this one first, and you alternate between the two regulators every ten to 15 minutes. When you change to this one, um, click this one. - [clicking] - Yeah. - [speaks Chinese] - Good. - Yes. - [speaks Chinese] Nice, good. [air hisses] [men chattering in Thai] [men chattering in Thai] [thunder rumbling] [men chattering in Thai] [police radio chatter in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [no audible dialogue] [cameras clicking] [water dripping] [phone buzzing] [phone continues buzzing] [indistinct chatter in Thai] [phone buzzing] [crying] [reporter on TV] Now to Thailand. Rescuers there are not giving up hope in their search for a missing youth football team. Authorities there believe that they are trapped in the cave system that you see here. They're sending in some of Thailand's best to try to get them out. [stomach rumbling] [in Thai] [chittering] [boy clucks] [all laughing] [chattering in Thai] [phone buzzing] [chattering in Thai] [cheering] [dramatic music playing] [cheering] [engine rumbling] [indistinct radio chatter] I'm standing in the mouth of the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai, where efforts to find the boys and coach who went missing inside last Saturday, have been hindered by high water levels and strong currents. But, today, the British civilian cave divers are getting ready to lay lines much deeper inside after water levels fell substantially overnight. They did this by redirecting huge amounts of water away from the cave complex using special Turbojet water pumps. Unfortunately, for the farmers down the hill, that means flooding their fields and destroying their crops. [dramatic music playing] [chattering] [in Thai] [water bubbles] [in English] How... how many of you? - Thirteen. - Thirteen? - Yeah. - [boy 1] Yeah. - Brilliant! - [boy 2] Yeah, yeah. [female reporter 1] Alright, enormous relief in Thailand as rescue teams found... [male reporter] Breaking news, the miracle rescue. The ten day ordeal playing out in front of the world... [speaking Thai] [female reporter 2] Authorities say they have found these 12 kids and their coach. [female reporter 1] Look at that, alive in a cave nearly ten days after the group went missing. [applause] [reporter speaking Thai] [Jon] We are coming. It's okay. Many people are coming. [in Thai] [in English] Now that they're known to be alive attention is turning already to how to get them out. The authorities have three options on the table: Number one: Drill holes into the mountain, create an alternate passage... So the last option... is to do it the hard way. That means sending divers in, to bring them out through the flooded passages. The way they went in, basically. [rooster crowing] [in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [boy inhales deeply] [radio chatter in Thai] [tense music playing] [speaking Thai] [speaking Thai] [air hisses] [exhales] [clanging] [tense music playing] [muffled chatter] [breathing heavily] [grunting] [dramatic music playing] [crying] [soldier speaking Thai] [soldiers marching] [sobbing] A Thai Navy SEAL diver has died trying to save 12 boys and a coach trapped in a cave system in Thailand. I wanna show you a map, a visual of what we're talking about here because you get a sense of exactly what these crews have been dealing with. [male reporter 2] The man fell unconscious during his dive back out of the cave. There's more monsoon rains forecast which means more flooding likely from Sunday. And this is all a reminder of the huge challenge involved in trying to bring these boys to safety. [chattering] [in Thai] [reporters clamoring] [in Spanish] [in French] [in Thai] This is Todd Ruiz, live from the Tham Luang Cave rescue site, where signs are mounting that something is either about to happen, or may have already begun. [in Chinese] We've got 12 kids and a soccer coach trapped in that cave and as you can imagine emotions are running at an elevated level. We are well aware of the situation. What do you suggest we do? Frankly, sir, we're running out of time. If we don't act now and that weather changes, we may lose hope of even getting one of them out alive. Officially, it's said that the authorities are still meeting to decide on which course of action to take. But just in the past hour, ambulances have assembled at the ready here. And just a few moments ago the screen, sort of privacy screen, went up over the entrance of the cave. And what are the odds? Well, if we move now, I can see 60, 70 percent success rate. But, sir... we may lose three or four. Not all these boys might make it home. [dramatic music playing] [clock ticking] Um, I need the 40 kilo bag, okay? Okay. Thanks. - [man] Here you are. - Thanks for the lift, mate. Good luck, buddy, take it easy over there. [plane beeps] [man 1] Did you hear about the soccer team stuck in a cave in Thailand? [man 2] No, did they all die? No, they found them alive. It's all over the news, check it out. [man 2] Wow. - Mr. Warny. - [Jim] Yeah. Would you like to come over? - Hi, Jim. - How're you doing? - Long time no see. - Yeah. - [woman] Thank you. - Mm-hm. - [woman] Flight to Bangkok? - Yep. - Thank you. - Can I take a photo with you? Yeah, no problem. [woman over PA indistinct] [man indistinct] - Hi, Jim. - Hi. My name is Captain Bas. - Welcome to Chiang Rai - Nice to meet you. You are the hope of Thai people now. [dramatic music playing] [overlapping chatter in Thai] Thanks. Hi, guys. Long time no see. - Probably about seven years. - Yeah. - Connor. - John. - Hey, Jim. - Harry. We're heading in now. You guys can follow in later. - Okay. - Mike and Gary will brief you first. - Take care. - See you later. - Good luck, man. - Good luck. [in Thai] [in English] Each of the lead divers: John, Rick, Jason, and Chris will take one boy each and lead them from chamber nine through to chamber three. The rest of the guys, including you, who are to act as support divers. You're gonna help them change tanks, and importantly, you're gonna check that the positive pressure face masks are tight against their faces. As you know, if those masks leak those boys will drown. Especially because they'll be heavily sedated with ketamine. What do you mean by sedated? [Gary] Totally unconscious. Hmm. How much of it's underwater? The flooded passage is approximately one kilometer long with the occasional air pocket along the way. The Americans will help you with your tanks through to chamber three. And then you're in the water at three. And as you can see here: 150, 200, 350 meters diving. I've got you here in chamber five. When the guys come through, it's a matter of checking tanks. You'll have tanks there to replace, if necessary. As I say, just keep checking those masks. - Okay? - [Connor] Mm-hm. Are we sure we're all good with that sedation business, yeah? Yeah. We have no choice. It's either this... or there's no diving. It's too risky. Yeah. If they panic and put our divers' lives in danger... Yes, sir, but the Australian attaché told me yesterday that their people had immunity before the plane landed. If we get another rain one of those boys could drown, or just as bad, one of them not wake up from the sedative once they're extracted. [tense music playing] [women giggling, chatting in Thai] Very good! Two UK divers, yeah. These are gonna be running back and forth. We're gonna check those in a second. Sir. Sir, the divers from the UK are here. Alright, just make sure that the UK divers have everything that they need. - Yes, sir. - Okay. Jim, you need a hand with anything? Uh, no, I should be fine. Cylinders here. - Okay. - Thanks. - Anything at all, let me know. - Yeah. - [metal clanging] - [air hisses] - You good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. [air hisses] Change? No, thanks, I prefer using my own. It's okay. Thanks. I'll change the tank now. You boys pull this off there's a bottle of Jack Daniels waiting for you. No thanks, I'd rather have Guinness. [tense music playing] Well, I guess we wait here then. [grunts] You know, I can't understand how it got mixed up. You know, they sent the wrong ones. I will talk to my colleagues at the Swiss embassy. - Yes, that'd be good. - Okay, see you later. Hi, Ben. We have a problem. - Yeah, how can I help? - It's these masks. We really need the positive pressure option. To ensure air is going out rather than water coming in. Also, they're too large for boys' faces. The lads were saying, particularly the 11 year-old-- I mean, he's just tiny. [Gary] We sourced a couple of positive pressure masks from a shop in Cardiff. But we need to get them on a Thai Airways flight this evening. I think they're coming, Jim. Oh, yeah, that's Jason. - Are you good? - I'm okay. I'll keep moving. This is Todd Ruiz with Khaosod English. We're very excited to be able to tell you that the first two boys have been rescued from the cave. [people cheering] [siren blaring] [helicopter whirring] [speaking Thai] [radio chatter in Thai] [people cheering] [chattering in Thai] [clapping] [text message alert] [text message alert] [tense music playing] These are the masks they need in Thailand. - [indistinct radio chatter] - Good afternoon, sir. I guess you're here to make sure they get to the flight on time. How fast are you comfortable driving, sir? - [siren blaring] - [indistinct radio chatter] [in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [chattering in Thai] Chris, Ivan's not gonna make it. His sinuses are really playing up, so, can you sort someone else out? - Sure, sure. - Yeah? - Chris. - Jim, uh, looks like Ivan can't dive today. He's ill. - Okay. - We're gonna be a man short in chamber six. - Yeah. - Can you go with Erik and Josh can take your place? - Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not? - Cool, cool. You shouldn't need any more air than yesterday to get to six. - Okay. - Okay, do you wanna get changed? I'll ask Dr. Harris to come over and show you how to sedate. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Okay. - Cool, thanks. We're gonna give the kids an intermuscular injection of ketamine. Bloody amazing drug, really. It's mainly used these days as a horse tranquilizer. So, I've got these kits ready for you. The syringes are pre-loaded. So you wanna find a place on the upper thigh between here and here and inject them. - Give them the full dose. - Hm. So, uh, how deep do we go with the needle? - Only about two-thirds. Alight? - Okay. And each dose must be at least ten minutes apart, or you might lose an airway. Hm. Means they'll stop breathing. Okay? - Hm, Erik, is it? - Jim. - Hi. - How you doing mate? You're with me? Yeah, yeah. Pity about Ivan, eh? - Oh, man, yeah. - He's okay, is he? - Yeah, he'll be fine. - Yeah. So, how do you rope into this? Uh, um, well, I know the British lads quite... quite long now. But, uh, a few years back, a buddy of mine passed away diving and, uh, Rick, John and Jason, they came over for the recovery. Aw, shit, dude. Sorry to hear about that. [Jim] How about yourself? [Erik] Oh, I've been living here for a year. A friend of mine was up here and... said they needed some hands so... here we are. Start gearing up? - Mitch, how're you doing? - Pretty good, how are you? What's our ETA? Uh, the Brits gone in, you boys are next. Nice, mate. Let me help you with that. You got the drugs? Yeah. Yeah, Harry sorted me out already. It's, uh... I have them here. Alright, good luck, gentlemen. See you in six, yeah? [Jim] You okay, Erik? - [Erik] All good, mate. - Cool. - You good, man? - [Erik] Yeah, mate, I'm good. - [Jim] Good. Keep going. - Yeah. [coughing] Here we are mate. Chamber six. - Yeah. - Home sweet home. So.. how's the cave diving in Thailand, then? Wouldn't know to be fair. It's actually my first cave. [chuckles] No, I just moved here, and I think most of them are actually shut. What about before Thailand? Uh, lived in Egypt for six years. Had a little tech center there, it was great. - Yeah. - Cool. No caves there either. Nope. Deep walls and wrecks, my friend. [both chuckle] Is that a light down there? [muttering] Yeah. Alright. Off you go. - That's Chris, is it? - Yeah. He's gonna need a new cylinder. [mutters] [muttering] [muttering] [indistinct chatter] [coughing] Alright, we good? The seal okay, is it? [indistinct chattering] Okay. Alright, Jim. - Ready to follow me out? - Yeah. Okay. - It's wearing off. - Okay. Uh, do you want me to do it? - Please, Jim. - Yeah. - [tense music playing] - [clock ticking] Okay, we're good. Okay. See you on the other side, yeah? Yeah. [grunting] [sighs] [exhales] [in Thai] [reporter on TV] We've just heard from a member of the rescue operation who says he's now seen an eighth boy emerge from the cave. [sirens blaring] [cheering] [cameras clicking] [Jason] Okay, so tomorrow we've got the coach coming out, too. So we need an extra diver to bring the boy out. Jim, do you think you can handle it? [line trilling] - [woman on phone] Hi, Jim. - Hey. How are you? How are you? You look tired. Yeah, uh... They asked me to bring out one of the boys tomorrow. Wow, that's a big thing. How do you feel about it? I'm terrified. You'll be okay. Yeah, the diving's easy, but, um... you know, carrying those kids through the water, it's tough. You know what you're doing. And, you know, for the last two days you did a great job. - So, you just go and do the same. - Yeah. And then you come back home. Good. I better get some sleep, huh? Yeah, go and have some rest. Yeah. Kisses. Love you, too. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. Bye. [dramatic music playing] [camera clicks] [indistinct yelling] How are you doing, Jim? Oh, not too bad. Didn't sleep much last night though. - Taking number five out. - Oh, you'll be fine, man. Thanks for leaving me alone in six though, I appreciate it. - No worries. - [chuckles] - Alright, last day. - Yeah. - Let's finish this off. - Okay. - Jim. - Oh, yeah. How's it going? I've got the gear for the boy. - Thanks. - Special delivery. Alright. Cheers. You know, you're doing a great job, Jim. It's amazing what you guys do. It takes balls to dive in that cave. Well, you guys are the real heroes. Jumping out of helicopters. Dodging bullets. Anyway, rather you than me. [water splashing softly] [Jim exhales] [grunts] [grunts] Hello? You in there, guys? Hey, guys. [man] Hi. - [clears throat] - [sighs] [man chuckles] Jim. How was the dive? Oh, great. Visibility was amazing. - Mikko? - No, I'm fine, thanks. No, thanks. - Grab a bit. - [grunts] - Cheers. - Cheers, mate. Mm. Are they gone long? I don't know. Feels like forever. [tense music playing] [Mikko] Put him on his side. Big one up. Jim... go get your gear on. [tense music playing] Watch out... [mutters] Okay. [man] That's okay. [Jim] Is he gonna need more drugs? I just gave him a shot. Won't need another... until we get to chamber five. [clock ticking] [Mikko] Breathing. There you go. - Arms. - Got it. [mutters] Breathing. [man coughing] Okay. You hold him like this. Okay. I'll go now, yeah? See you later. [mutters] [tense music playing] [coughs] [Connor] You need me to come over? No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh, wait a minute, he's moving. Can you come over? Shit. He's got a hold of my hose, actually. [grunts] Okay... Okay, hold him still there, yeah. Alright. Okay. Okay. Done. Okay. Should be good, yeah? - I'll lead the way. Okay? - Yeah, yeah. - [coughing] - Watch out. [grunts] [grunting] [Jim] Ah, fuck. [muffled grunting] [Jim] Oh, Shit. Good, good. You're doing good. What the fuck am I doing here?! [tense music playing] [boys' voices echoing] [laughter echoing] [chanting in Thai] [chattering in Thai] [in English] They're coming. Alright, gentlemen, fish on! [tense music playing] One, two, three, lift. [grunting] One, two, three... [Mitch on radio] O'Brien, we've got the coach. He's all good. Roger that, stretcher two en route. - Let's roll. - [man] Come on. We got the coach. Great job, Jim. [Jim] Hm, really? No wonder. He looked a bit big for a child. He kept waking up, too. [grunting] Okay, stop and down. Ready? Two, three... up. - [grunting] - [O'Brien] Up. Watch the head. And up. Good job, thank you. Alright, focus, here. Try to keep his feet up. [man and woman speaking Thai] [mutters] Help him over the rock there. [female translator speaking Thai] [Anderson] Alright, slow and steady guys. Keep... keep his feet up. - [chattering] - [man] Get him in. [Anderson] Slow, slow, slow. Alright, keep him level. Keep him level. Down. Okay, Sergeant, you wanna grab his pulsox there? Okay, guys, slow and steady. Focus. - [beeps] - Get him unclipped. - [sergeant] All good, 98, 105. - Okay, check respiration. Okay, guys, we're gonna move him back. Alright? [man speaking Thai] Okay. [chattering in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [applause and cheering] [sobbing] [in English] It's a story of heroism and sacrifice that has captivated the whole world for over two weeks. But tonight, what was a desperate mission of last resort is over. They said it couldn't be done. But against all odds, all 13 members of the Wild Boars Football Team-- that's the last one-- are out safely. And as you can tell from the people around me, everyone is ready to celebrate a success of almost mythic proportion. [sirens blaring] [cheering and applause] Come on, let's go. Get him out of here. [cheering continues] Head back. - You're the last one, Tan? - Yeah. [cheering continues] You know what, Tan? You're a hell of a guy. After you. [cheering continues] We couldn't have saved those kids without you. I can't thank you enough. Yeah, well, you guys were amazing, as well. We couldn't have done it without you. You're a hero, buddy. Thank you. Sorry, everyone, um, this is the kids' family. They want to say something with the team. They said "thank you". You're welcome. Take care. Happy to help. [helicopter whirring] [in Thai] [dramatic music playing] [male interviewer in English] Did you feel responsibility, Jim, for human life? Oh, huge, yeah, yeah. [interviewer] And how did that play in your mind? Um... you... you get into this zone. You try to pack all the stresses into a corner and focus on the job. And it's complete... complete concentration. I'm humbled by what you did, if I may say so. - And, I-I-- I am. - [audience applauding] [speaking Thai] [dramatic music playing] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
