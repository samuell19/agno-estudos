TO BE TWENTY I WAS 20. NO ONE CAN EVER TELL ME IT WAS THE BEST TIME OF OUR LIVES Let's hope he stops. I'm bushed. - See? - It's him! - The sailor. - No, it's Ali Baba. Babas, yum! The lives of men follow unfathomable signs. - I've seen you somewhere. - Yeah, sure! You're free spirits, right? Of course! I'm deeply pleased to make your acquaintance. It's about time our paths crossed. Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Resplendent Ray, but my disciples call me Nazariota. - Huh? - Nazariota. I communicate trust in the value of the spirit instead people trust TV, supermarkets. Mine is a difficult mission. I have a commune in Rome, an oasis of spiritual peace. The right place for free people like you. It's one big family. Let's begin the initiation ceremony. Come one and all, have yourselves a good blow with these two generous novices, emblems of love, freedom and disinterest. If we can screw consumerism, what's better than a nice blow? Get in! In my commune, I can offer a bed and three meals a day. Great deal, with today's recession! Ask for Nazariota, Piazza Dante, they all know me. You'd better get out now. You can hitch another ride at that restaurant. - Thanks! - You're welcome, bye. There it is, food! Not too inspiring. Hungry? Let's eat, then find a lift. - I'm not hungry. - I'm starving... What a character that Nazariota. Life in a commune might be interesting. I think I'd like it, you? We were invited, so, we can go. There's the restaurant! - It looks cheap enough. - I hope so! Wow, a jukebox! - Want a sandwich? - Okay. - What's in it? - A sort of ham. I don't like that kind! What's in this? Are you two hitchhiking? - Are you heading South? - No. - But we can take you. - You'd do that? They're giving us a lift! What luck! Thanks. Want to sit at our table? No, thanks. I'd rather dance. Let's all dance! Wake up! They make you horny! - Are you women? - As much as you're a man. - They're just a couple of sluts. - They did it on purpose! I know what they want! That's today's young people. C'mon, let me feel your ass. That's enough, leave us alone! Stop, what the hell do you want? Guys, one step at a time. Shut up! How much do we give them? 30 dollars. Too much! We give all the fun. Sir, what's the blonde worth. I'll give you the money myself! Here's 30, for the ten of you to jack off. Let's go, it stinks of shit here. Where's the road? I don't know, but I'm sure we're almost there. Almost? We've walked a mile! - We going in circles. - Don't worry! I'm scared! - How much farther's the road? - Not far. It's a classic place for werewolves. Hear that? Don't be afraid, it's probably just some stray dogs. I never took you for a chicken. There it is, we'll stop the next car. It's those guys from the restaurant! Run! Run, Tina! C'mon, c'mon! Where are we going? I don't know, but hurry. Run! C'mon! This way! - I can't take anymore! - Run. Tina, run! Stop! I want to do something first. What do you want from us? Leave me alone! Be good girls. Stop it! You too. Be good, you sluts. You'll love it, just wait. What an ass you've got! Okay, the walk's over. So, you like music! Leave her alone, you bastard! - Is this all you want? - Don't touch her! Strip, show us your stuff! The cops are coming, leave those bitches! Let's beat it! - What a shitty road! - Stay with it. I'd love to get one of those impotent bastards alone. - We were lucky. - If they get us again? - We're far away. - I'd like to shoot them! I just want to get out of here. The same old story, you dance you're a whore, you laugh you're a whore, you hitchhike you're crazy and a whore, I should never have any fun, well, I will! He Stopped! - Want a ride? - Going to Rome? If you put out. Asshole, who wants to go with you. Who do you think you are? A woman, finally! You should be ashamed. You look like whores soliciting on the road. We're not whores. Right, whores have more decorum. - We have no bus money. - What an excuse! Or a 50,000 dollar car either. Strange no one's picked you up. Get off the road! First we're whores, but whores have more decorum, then, it's strange no one's picked us up. You want to? I get it. No, you don't. Keep your money. Bye, auntie! I know their kind, they divvy up men and women for their own fucking interest. I wouldn't say fucking! There's a truck! You'll take us to Rome, right? - Hi, where's Piazza Dante? - First left. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello. - Is this Piazza Dante? - Yes. - Where's number 21? - People don't have addresses here! - What are you looking for? - A commune. - A what? - Lots of people live there. A chubby guy from Naples who wears long dresses runs it. I know! That place full of queers, whores and druggies? It's right over there. - Are you actually going there? - Yes. Goodbye. We're crazy about these things! Come on, don't be swayed. - Is this Nazariota's commune? - Yes, it's here. - Finally! - Why, are you going there too? - Sure! - Then I'm leaving. I hope you do. And I hope you leave too. Come stay with Nazariota Careful, idiots are watching you Tina, I'm never leaving here. "My name's Rico and I live in Piazza Dante, 21". It's pointless, he's tripping. If you keep kissing him, you'll get high too! Let's go. What spider webs! Hi, guys. Who gives a shit? Politics is over. Stinks like a corpse. - Where's Nazariota? - Over there. Says he'll wait till tomorrow, then he'll bust your ass. He can bust my ass but I have no money. What kind of reasoning is that? Peace and evil. You're looking for me? How are you? Fine, you look great too. - A lecher from the start? - Temperamental! - Tell him, he doesn't remember us. - Right. You don't remember? On the highway, two days ago. Of course, I do! - He's stoned. - There are too many of you! Since you're so nice, we came to visit. Thank you. Here we are, we'd like to stay a while. Of course, why not? But now there's a fee to pay. A fee? Communes can't charge fees! - What is this, a boarding school? - It's a family-run guest house. Communes are a thing of the past. We have to pay electricity, water, gas, solid waste removal. Solid waste removal? The trash! Didn't you see it by the door? There are lots of us here. - But we don't have any money. - You'll pay in kind. What can you do? We're young, hot and pissed off. You can cook and sweep. Can you do that? Okay, a stinker's coming... - Where do we sleep? - Wherever you want. Okay, go on now. - Let's go find a bed. - All right. This is the commune I mean! Wow, all these males! We'll definitely get laid here! - Where should we sleep? - On top of them, right? They probably haven't bathed since birth. These guys are all stoned and there's no room. We've found the best solution. When we want sex, we wake these deadbeats and then come here to get high! There are kids here! Look! How cute! I'm Patrizia, how are you? Fine! They're triplets. Marco, Luca and Tino. Which is which? They're easy to tell apart, they're all different. I gave birth to all three. This is Marco. This is Luca. And the one you're holding is Tino. - Tino's the smallest. - How the hell did you manage? How did they fit in you? I just wanted to experience motherhood. Then I had three, what could I do? Well, now you can count on us. Thanks, but I wouldn't sleep in here if I were you. I'm inexperienced and they cry all day. - Were they born brats? - No! No, it's me. I don't know what to do. Let's go find a bed. - I'll stop by later. - Thanks. Right... me too... No doubt... This is where we'll sleep. Look at this guy, he's a statue. This is the best room yet. And he looks harmless. Well, he's better than triplets. You're sleeping in his room? - Weren't you leaving? - Nothing any better. Firm as a melon! - It's the tight jeans. - If you say so... Nice stuff in there. A little touchy, aren't we? Well, calm down! If you want, I'll calm you down. Then I'll calm you down too. You see me dressed like this, but I'm a real stallion. Don't judge a book by its cover, just try me! - You? - Don't you trust me? - Scram, creep. - How about it? How do you men say it? You just turned me off! You're lucky, after me you won't want it from anyone else! Beat it, creep! - I'm going. - Thank God. Peace and evil! So, you've settled in here? Who am I? How am I supposed to know if you don't? Look at this guy, hasn't moved in three months. Doesn't eat, drink or sleep. He's practically invisible. - He gave up everything. - Gave up what? The pleasures of life, of the flesh and of sex! Different from you two who are inclined towards these pleasures. I could use your help. - With what? - Satisfying desires. The whore thing again? Well, it's my job to manage this commune. What if someone feels the need to "communicate"? Communicate what? Your body, hers or everyone's with yours! - Sounds like an orgy! - More or less! Communication is the basis of co-habitation. And if someone wants to "communicate", you must comply. Try to understand! All right, as long as they're clean. Of course, we can rinse off their balls in the basin. Just stop complicating things, I have loans to pay off... Are you hungry? - Lunch is on me. - You've got money? No! But it's on me anyway! - We need a cart. - Right. There's a ton of stuff here! There! These too. Where's the bread? - Must be around here. - There, just what I love. Done. - The old guy saw us. - Hope we can finish the sandwich. - Two girls are stealing. - I'll handle it. Here they come, we'd better go. Put everything you can in the bag! Don't leave them anything. - It's enough for two days. - I'll take this. Hurry! Stop! Catch! Stop! Coffee's on me. - Two coffees, please. - Pay first. Mind your own business. I get off at 4:00. The Coffee's on me, but I want to see you later. I don't think we can wait until 4:00. Bye! Mr. Fiorenza, the ladies had two coffees. He said if we waited for him, he'd pay for the coffee. He said he gets off at 4:00. Who do you think you are, the boss? Come in! Zamboni, do you shave with a blade or an electric razor? Electric razor. Then take this talcum powder home with you. You'll need it tomorrow morning. I'm sending your ass back to that backwards redneck town of yours. You waste of life! One fuck-up after another. Zamboni... I hope you're not collaborating with that damn Shorty. You give him fake drugs, he plants it, then you come out a hero. Then you split the special fund account. Am I right? I'm just kidding! But I want you to close that commune down. Close it down, nobody big goes there. Find something else. Somewhere else, get to work! Instead of interfering with the police labor union. Got it? Get out of here! I like screwing but I get to choose. I said we'd do it, but we don't have to. No one's forcing us. Thing! Does Nazariota profit from the commune? From the drug dealers or us whoring ourselves? I'm not here with you. Only my body is present. I must be careful not to contaminate it. So sings the Celestial Father. Listen to him... Just go to India. He wants to be pure in spirit. What's wrong with that? I bet he splits it fifty-fifty with Nazariota. There's serious money in this commune. So why are you always alone and isolated? I suffer here, all alone. My soul is ridden with anxiety and torment. This will hasten my arrival to the Celestial Father. He will know when I'm ready. I need to pee or I'll do it in my pants. With all this talk... Bye! What a drag! I wonder if he's got an upper half! I could have sworn you'd be here, even with the door open! - Are you sexophobic? - What? - Do you know who Wilhelm Reich is? - The singer? The writer, have you read "The Sexual Revolution"? No, I did the revolution! With who? Get educated! They stink even more now. Someone's awake! Does anyone want to stay with me? Does anyone here fuck? Why don't you just get high, sister? It eliminates thoughts of copulation. Right! And you're a dickhead. With due respect for dicks... And no offence to druggies. What a shit I am! Men! Oh, God! What's that? I stole milk from those two Swedish girls to feed the babies. Thanks. - Have you seen my friend? - No. Every time I need you I can't find you. Two guys are in there waiting. - I don't feel like it. - She doesn't? Drink without thirst, eat without hunger, sex without wanting... that separates humans from animals. - What a drag! - Don't let it get to you. What kind of commune is this? Rent, a bunch of impotent guys and you can't screw when you want. - Nazariota has two guys for us. - I can just imagine! Well, let's get some money out of it. Your friend's looking for you. - Are you stupid or just act it? - I act it. - You're good at it. - Not everyone can. I can't find my milk, who took it? Did you take my milk? I didn't even take milk from my mother's tits! Stop staring at me. - Nazariota sent us. - How's it going? - Who's that? - Nazariota's dumb brother. He's living here instead of in a psychiatry ward. It's cheaper! What does your Celestial Father say? Look at them! - Let's go out. - How about it? No, thanks. We'll go out, come back and we're ready to go again. For what? A race? - Do you get whores often? - Yes. Only a whore would teach them that relationships are nonsense. - We're going out. - Bye. Lucky you don't understand a damned thing. I get them all? I haven't had sex in a month, no one in this place is willing. I could feel sick all day for that! Maybe you think I'm a bitch, but it's important to me. I need satisfaction, these unfinished quickies aren't enough. They upset my whole life and I feel terrible afterwards! Hold on, I'm coming! Get Professor Affetati, tell him it's about the encyclopedia. What are you staring at? - I'll get the professor. - You do that. Good day, Professor! I always thought that to sell an encyclopedia to me... they'd at least send another professor. Anyway, have a seat. You're dismissed. I know these! I've already read them. I was hoping to discuss the work... Nonetheless, I must admit... I'm pleased to see a young girl interested in culture. Yes, my father is very proud of me. Especially in these times when your peers... are all a bunch of misfits! I know, that's what my teacher always says. Good for you! I see you're on the right track! Well, it's a good edition. I'll take it. Even though I'm against their choice of philologist editors! I've dedicated my life to that field. - As well as publishing. - You're a writer? I prefer the term: "opinion-maker". Cultured men fascinate me! Culture in itself is fascinating. You are fascinating! And cultured and self-confident. Do you like my trousers? Mother says they're a perfect fit. Well... they fit perfectly. But I'm a man who considers women in trousers... slightly unnatural. Really? I find them... modestly... Without offending you, naturally. - Really? - I'm sure you find them practical. Participating in culture... and the spreading of ideas... Please go on! I get goose bumps every time you say "culture". Culture? My dear, culture... Culture! You know you remind me of Ottilie... Wolfgang's character... Goethe, that is. I believe all great geniuses brought female characters to life... who manage to elevate their existence and sensuality... by means of culture. I believe intense romantic content can make up for... Make up for what? It doesn't... Will you sign the check please? Straight away! The check... Well, actually... culture... You see, my dear... culture... Culture is... - Say "culture"! - Culture... Again! Culture. If you should so desire... - Say it. - Culture. - I would be happy... - I am happy. Happiness wants company. - Say "culture"! - Culture! - Stay there! - Culture. Stay there! - Hi, we're millionaires! - Went well? A cappuccino. - I sold two and there's still time. - I don't want to. - Why? Are you tired of it? - No. - Are things okay? - Yes. Did anyone give you trouble? We'll do the next one together. Hello. Please come in. Go on! - Who are you? - A retired... I should introduce myself. I'd first like to see what you've brought. It's nothing! - We're here about the encyclopedias. - I've been expecting you. Are you a book collector? No, I horde them, I devour them. It's the only thing I do in retirement. The one and only thing? I was married. Is this her? Rather austere. What a harpy! Throw it out. That woman sucked the joy and will to live from my life. And she tried so hard that in the end... she gave her life doing it. You see, ladies... I would be very upset if you were prostitutes disguised as booksellers. We can discuss that later. You're too sad a sight right now. Yes, I am quite stressed. Can you feel my heart pounding? Yet I'm healthy and my heart is strong. I've never had two young girls hold me like this. Just that stinky old whale of a wife for 30 years... And a few whores. I always give without receiving. I can tell you're not prostitutes. You're spontaneous! And you look happy! You're sure you want nothing from me? And you're doing this to make me happy? Because I'm already happy. I'm not asking you for much. You can make your film wherever you want. I'm only asking for 100 bucks. I'll give you fuck all! It's no film, it's an analytical look at human relationships, the individual's need for absolute freedom, you idiot! - There's "Peace and Evil". - Relax. If he offers us another deal, I'll kick him in the balls! At least give something to these girls to make me look good. Just get out of here. At least admit I manage this place! - Go! - Damn you! - What are we supposed to do? - Not "do" but "be"! Tell me about yourselves, who you are and what you've done. - The truth? - And nothing more. - I ask nothing else. - Then let's do it. Rolling, action! Tell me what your names are. - I'm Lia. - My name is Tina. Tina, tell me what made you leave home. Why did you break with your family? They tried to make me a good housekeeper. Next to virginity, it's what my parents care about most. My father works for Customs. What he likes most about my mother is that she's a penny pincher. She wasn't tight, she just did it to make him happy. I can just see her at the store, haggling over a price. She'd grown numb to saving face. She had to be happy saving money! So she could give it to my son-of-a-bitch father! Day by day he made a fortune off my mother's dignity! He turned her into him, and I was living with two strangers! I don't understand you. You have your own life now. You left in time from being fucked up by your family. Why are you so angry? They haven't even come after you. Luckily! Ever since they found out I like to fuck! You know what? At least something happened to you. Sure, you lived a life that wasn't for you. But you dealt with it, you rebelled. While my past is empty. I lived in an orphanage until I was 13. No memories, nothing ever happened. Thirteen empty years. Nothing but civil and lenient nuns. - And unloving! - And then? Then three more years as a janitor at a Catholic boarding school. Wake-up time at 6:00 am, bedtime at 6:00 pm. Nothing but apathy and politeness. Not a single human relationship. - Not a single word. - What shit! - Did you run away? - No, of course not. At 16, I was sent to work for an old spinster in a small town. You know how a woman who's not young or old lives in a small town? - I can imagine. - No, you can't. As soon as I turned 18, I left. It's been 2 years now. What experiences have you had? One year isn't enough. When did you start fucking? Fucking? Is that what you call it? That old spinster used to make me masturbate her. I didn't understand it. I thought it was normal. She could see that and took advantage of me. What a raw deal! What about men? I've been with a few, but men or women, it's the same to me. I don't care about sex, I do it if it comes along. You don't care? I definitely care! I care about it more than anything! - That's all. - All right, thanks. You there. Go sit down with everyone else. And listen up carefully. As you already know, all the ideologies and religions man has invented over the centuries have all failed. But it finally reached this unbearable level when Christianity, Marxism and psychoanalysis created environmental and personal conditions for schizophrenia... Doesn't the Celestial Father ever get bored? What a nice surprise! - What are you doing here? - Got a joint? No, sorry. I haven't got anything. Excuse me! You don't mind, do you? I don't want to be bothered for a while, not even by you. I think you're discreet, and you have all your contacts with the hereafter! Done! Good day to you. Here I am. You never get to be alone here. I realize the commune is a common space but... You want to have your space with me inside and him outside. Everyone else is looking for room to run around in. And you'd rather trip. Free from the need of sex and reproduction that men are slaves to. Go ahead. One day, due to a genetic mutation an abnormal woman was born. A walking monster, an emotionally deficient being. I used to like having sex. I always wanted girls like you. Who liked sex too. Unsuitable and lacking the necessary aggression. Slovenly as a lover, in other words, a bragger. A pip-squeak with dysfunctional femininity who despises women. That's man! Man! Man! Destroy the beast! I haven't tripped in two days and what have I found? Let's start a movement of superwomen who use criminal methods to kill scores of men and destroy this work and hierarchy-based society. And uses any reasonable men as an anti-viral function. The ones who are aware of their subnormal nature. All new ideas create feelings of confusion. We shall continue this debate and provide other opinions here on "Giving the World to Women". This is a non-profit investigative film. We only tell the truth. Feminism is too serious to let feminists handle it. You're a feminist, what do you think of matriarchy? If I were Ulrike Meinhof, I wouldn't leave Andreas Baader to listen to Solanas. If there were only women, I could support Jacqueline Kennedy instead of Guevara, understand? I'm out of here... Jacqueline Kennedy... Che Guevara... "Beader" Meinhof... Who the fuck... Who left him there? He's everywhere, like the Holy Ghost! - Everything okay? - Just great. And he's staying here with me. And no more of your men. Everyone has a right to make their own decisions. There is more than one way to help out the commune. Like selling encyclopedias door-to-door, which you already do. Sticking your nose in our business! I know people in the field of encyclopedias. You'll give me 10% for every contract. Why don't we just whore ourselves to reluctant buyers? Of course not! I'll send you only to rich neighborhoods. - How does that sound? - All right, we accept. I'll go and get the things you... If you go out like that, you'll definitely sell more... Get lost! - And now? - We already know this work. Think we can do it? Why not, we're young, hot and pissed off. How should we organize? Like this: I'll take the women and you take the men. Sounds right. Then we'll have a vacation and take him along. How long have you had this job? I started this morning. Would you like a subscription? There's something else I'd like... How much do you make off your sales? 20% on each one. One is for the encyclopedias. And one is for you. Buy something nice for yourself. Hi! Here I am! Look what she's got! Come see, it's a surprise! Get up and come over here. It's those books you saw the advert for on TV. I called for them to come. Didn't you like the illustrations? I promised I'd buy it for you. How much is it? - How much is it? - Cash or financing? Cash! 3,000 dollars plus tax. Here... Name and address and check off "cash". - Is a check okay? - I'd even take a piece of paper. Hear that? Your dad's an important man! Happy? You can get some culture into you. Thanks and goodbye! Goodbye to you too! Later, loser! Yuck, the meat's full of maggots. - Why do you keep coming here? - It's close to home. - I'm starving! - The bread's down there. See? The same girls as before. We are young, hot and pissed off. You... can't find happiness. Your heart is corrupt. You're injured, materialistic and slaves of your desires. Prisoners of your broken dreams. But the human spirit living in your bodies can only be satisfied by a radical union with the Great Spirit Creator. His is the Kingdom of Love. God is Love! The Lover of all lovers. What a nice speech! Take them away! Arrest them! - There are triplet babies! - Arrest them too. Get those babies! My babies! Don't touch my babies! Move, make it fast! Move it! Don't touch my guitar! Drugs! Yes. I'll take it in, get ready for questioning. It's called fraud! You know perfectly well it was honest business gone bad. - Honest? - Yes! It was an honest business gone bad because... it was honest. I guess honesty isn't your thing. - That was a good one! - Good, my ass! This is your third warning! Either keep that den clean of druggies and subversives or you're getting deported back to your hometown. People used to come for a couple of months. Now they come for 2 days, there's no time to get to know them! Times have changed! Then we might as well close you down! - Not that! - Yes that! You know who that whore is with the triplets? Who are the two new girls? Maybe they brought the drugs. - I definitely rule that out. - You can't, you piece of shit! You'd better hope so because if your old tenants brought those drugs in there, I'll get you for aiding and abetting! Who are your new tenants, tell me! The two girls, Rico, the single mother and the son of God. What God? What son? That one in white, the pacifist. Pacifists are always the worst ones! All terrorists were once pacifists. Bring in the ones he mentioned, the other ones get out tomorrow. - Can I go now? - You can go behind bars! And if I don't get to the bottom of this, you're going back to your hometown for fuck's sake! Your turn, get in there! What is this, Halloween? You can't go around like that! There are laws! What's your name, what do you do? Argiumas... is my name. Argiumas? What kind of name is that? Are you Greek? Argiumas what? Do you have a police record? Have you ever had trouble with the law? Don't ask my civilian name, as you call it. It no longer belongs to me, I try to forget it. Come on you clown, what's your name? Argiumas... is my name. Here! What does "here" mean? Tell me your name now and give me your identification! I'm looking for the Being inside of each being. Because we all seek shelter in ourselves. The sublime Friend we don't know! I'm in search of the sublime Being! What the hell's he saying? Be quiet. I might even find him here. You won't find him here! He resides in the intimate part of each of us. Very few can find Him. Do not use God's name in vain! He who sacrifices his dreams for the Supreme Being, the origin of all things, reaches perfection through sacrifice. Are you in the CIA? My partner says your sect is financed by the CIA. Is it true? What the hell are you after? I'm after the Sublime Being. The soul who finds the Sublime Being will be free from birth and death! And shall drink from the cup of immortality. Get this CIA spy out of here right now! Don't go saying those things in public! Bring in the druggie. C'mon, your turn. Just calm down! I'm here, you have to trust me! I talked to the Marshall, I explained it all. - Well? - Are you a druggie? Can't you read? Watch your tone of voice! Ask me again. Now you're being reasonable. Are you a druggie? It says right there. I can already see you're not all there. - What's your profession? - I am all there. Answer me, what's your profession? None. - Then how do you get by, parasite! - I'm a parasite! - How do you buy your drugs? - They're free. - Drugs cost money! - I know. Your suppliers... Where do they get drugs, who are they? Everyone knows them. I know them, my suppliers know them, and you know them too. Yet you do nothing about it. - Not you, but the establishment. - Establishment? Nonsense, the same old nonsense! That was the fad a few years ago. Catch up with the times, you're ideologically behind! And you're ahead of the times? They're going to send us back to our hometowns. What will become of you and them? I don't know. Do you have a place to go? What can I do to help you? I don't know. Have you ever seen Michele Palombo with political propaganda? - Who's Michele Palombo? - Nazariota! He's the commune boss, your boss. I don't understand the word "boss". Have you seen him with suspicious people? I don't distinguish between suspicious and non-suspicious people. You and all those commune people are suspicious! Got it? I don't see what goes on around me. You can't act like a Mafioso. "I saw nothing, I was sleeping..." You're the Mafioso. You little prick! Go talk to your slut mother that way! Drugs were found there and that's illegal. That means someone brought it there! Sit down. You got pissed off because of my tone of voice. And not because I called you "Mafioso". If you're curious if someone in the commune is a terrorist, ask your informer, because I don't know. - Cigarette? - Is it laced? Very funny. Do you know who the father of those triplets is? I heard you have a degree and a teaching certificate. So you were politically active! Don't you regret what you left behind? - Not a single regret? - Yes, maybe one. That I didn't assassinate oppressors. Get him out of here! And bring Shorty in. Just trust me and relax. He's good at faking seizures! That's what you all should do, so they get confused. Okay, you can let go now. You're wasting your time with these losers. They're not worth crap. The drugs were in the mother's room! It wasn't hers, or the full-time residents'. What do you mean? Did they knock the wind out of you? Can I help? No, it's nothing. It will pass... Maybe they're beating Shorty up too. Don't waste your time with that clown and that druggie Rico. Maybe the two new girls brought it in. Tina and Lia? They're a couple of airheads. But I guess, now that you say that... You'd better send them home, they might turn into terrorists. Okay, let's get this over with... You two get up. Put those babies down. Get moving! They're gone now, you can stop. I'm not wasting time with you, I'm deporting you from Rome. Fill out the forms, I'm going to see the chief. - Can he get us free movie tickets? - Button up, you slut. Sign these deportation papers. Report to the police chief in your hometown tomorrow before midnight. You'll be leaving together. I didn't file loitering charges. Just unemployment and homelessness charges. But if you're not in your hometown by midnight tomorrow, you'll be arrested for neglecting deportation orders. Then you'll both be behind bars. Now sign this. Here. You too. You're dismissed. I'll take care of it. Hello, a pack of Marlboros for a blow job. - Did you say "Marlboro"? - I said "blow job". No, thank you. - But I insist. - Thanks, anyway.
