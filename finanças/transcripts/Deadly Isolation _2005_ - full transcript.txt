Okay, pick it up! Come on! Over here! Let's go, boys! We've got them! Pick it up! Come on... Yeah, here. Keep going, boys! - And right behind me, somewhere in this forest is where Patrick Carlson and Kyle Mumford, the leading suspects in last June's San Francisco Gem Museum diamond robbery, have somehow seemed to disappear. While the police will not say so publicly, they have doubts that anyone can survive in this wilderness for very long. For Channel 2 news, I'm Rita Raines. - Expecting company, Daniel? - Patrick. I can't believe it's you. - You don't recognize me? - No, it's... You know the media kept saying that you guys must be dead out in the mountains there. You know, I figured that guys like you, you could survive anything. Did Kyle make it? - Hey, Danny boy. Good to see you again, buddy. - And it's great to see you guys too. I mean, you have no idea how freaked out I was when I heard the... when I heard the cops were on to you. I mean I checked the news reports all the time, you know, just hoping for a word that you guys were alive, you know. It's a real relief you're okay. - Where are the diamonds, Danny? The diamonds... we've got a little problem with that. Geez! - Talk! - Look, I laid low, okay, for the 6 months like we planned. Ron had the stones and I... - You didn't get them from him?! - This was his show, man. You know that! - So, he's got the stones, you're just hanging out, and we're freezing our asses off in the mountains? - Hey, don't blame me for that, okay?! I mean, I just about died when I heard they were after you! - Hmmph! - Now look, I waited the 6 months, okay, like we planned, and I called Ron, okay? Well, his wife answers and she tells me that Ron's dead. - Explain that to me, Daniel. - He killed himself. He killed himself. - He killed himself! - Kyle! Kyle! - He's sitting on 12 million dollars in diamonds and he kills himself?! - Kyle! Get off him! Let him talk! Danny, Danny, what happened to him? - I don't know. He checked into a motel, took a whole bunch of pills, that's all I know. I swear. Look, I wasn't expecting him to do that. Maybe he was just under a lot of pressure, I don't know. I mean, think about me, okay? Look what I was up against. Ron's dead, the stones are missing and I didn't know where they were, you know? - But now you know. - Yeah, I think I do. His wife must have them. They've got to be in the house. Of course she's living there. There's no... Look, there's no other place they could be. My God. - I've eliminated all the other possibilities, okay. Trust me! - Good, let's go get 'em then. - It's not that easy. It's Branford Island. It's just off the coast, about 10 miles away from here. Look, there isn't even a thousand people there, okay? Everybody's watching out for everybody else. Look, we just show up there, red flags are going to start going off all over the place. I've been thinking a long time about this. - You got a plan? - Yeah, yeah, I think I do. - Good boy. Yes. Come, come. - Hey, Susan. I thought I'd find you in here. Lisa. Did you see Nelson out front? - Yeah, there was Nelson and half the men in town are hanging around in the street outside. Do you think we should sneak out the back? - No, I think you should go out the front and let the rest of the world see you. - Okay. - Well. - She paints from 9 a.m. till 2 p.m. every day. It's like she's on a schedule or something. - And how do you know that? - I put a private eye on it just to find out more about her. I told him it was for a family law case. It worked like a charm. And this, I've got her whole life on this little computer. She lives all alone at the tip of the island, has few friends, rarely has any visitors. - What about Tuesday? Are we still on? - Yeah, it's gallery in Medford day, right? - Right. - I'll see you later. Susan! - Hey. - Well, look who it is. I swear, if you were a house I could sell you for a fortune. - Hey. Nelson, how are you? Good boy! I saw you come into town. It's been awhile. - Yeah. - Hi, Kirby! Fine, thank you. - Hi, Lisa. Sorry. Here's that file you wanted. - Great. - Sorry it took so long. - No problem. Thank you. - Sure. So, how's everything at the house? Do you need anything? - No, everything's good, thanks. - Okay, well I'll see you around then. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Nelson. - Bye, Kirby! - Bye, Lisa. - Yeah. You know what? You guys belong together. You have so much in common, you have so much to talk about. My God! My God, you're cut pretty bad. Are you okay? Can you hear me? I'm gonna help. Can you hold that? Okay. Nice and easy. Yeah... It's not that far. Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel like an idiot. - No, please don't feel like an idiot. Okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. I must have dozed off. - Keep your hand there. How do you feel? - Awful. - But what happened? It was windy and the deck was wet and I... I slipped. After that, all I remember is... you. - Okay, well I called the doctor and she's going to be here really soon, okay? - Okay. - But you just stay there and rest, right? - Okay, thanks. It's so beautiful here. - Yeah, how did you manage to find us? We usually don't get a lot of visitors. I was heading up to the Canadian coast. I like to stay pretty close to the shore, that way if I see anything I can... - We're interesting. So, what's your name? - God, I'm sorry. Jeff Watkins. - Jeff, I'm Susan Mandaway. - Please to meet you, Susan. Thank you so much for... Mandaway. Mandaway? - Yeah. - I had a teacher in college named Ron Mandaway. - Did you really? - Yeah. - What college? - Cal State. - My God. - What? - That's unbelievable... my... well, Ron... that's my husband, Ron Mandaway. - Tall, good looking guy. - Yes. - I think he was an undergraduate teacher. - Art teacher. - I sat in on a couple of his lectures. - It's unbelievable. - How is he? He's... he passed away. God, I'm sorry It's the doctor. Unbelievable. - Okay, let's take a look. - You're in good hands. Yeah, I'll have to stitch you. - Will you have to shave my head? - Nope. - I swear I can feel it healing already. - Good. A couple of stitches will help it along, otherwise you'll have a scar. Okay. - No, no, don't touch. - So, how did it go? - I think you should have just let me float right on past. - You'll need to rest for at least 2 days. I want to be sure you don't have a concussion. - Really? - Could be. It's hard to tell. I want you close by on the unlikely event that you suffer complications. - Okay. - If you like, I can drop you off at the hotel. - Actually would it be all right if I stayed on my boat tied up to your dock? She's kind of my baby, and I... - Yeah... Sure, why not. - Really? Thank you. - Okay, take care. See you around. - Okay, thank you. - I'm going to walk you out. - Are you sure about this, Susan? I mean, you don't really know him. - Well, he knew Ron in college. It'll be fine. - Check on him periodically and call me if you need to. Okay. Wait. Janet, what's the name of the medical examiner. - Steven Cartwright. - Right. - Good man. Why? - Well, I got his name from Kirby and I really want to talk to him. I'd love it if you could set up a meeting for me. - Honey, we know how Ron died and... Sure, I'd be glad too. - Thanks, I appreciate it. - I didn't think I was going to be that hungry. Thank you. - So, where are you from? Where's home? - Highland Park. Do you know it? It's just outside of Chicago. - Well, what do you do in Highland Park, just outside of Chicago? - Well, I... Up until recently I had a company that designed computer software: Firewalls and antivirus, that kind of stuff. And now? Well about a month ago I sold the company and now I'm in the process of trying to discover what I want to do when I grow up. - Okay! - At the very least, it's a good excuse for a long, long, much needed holiday. That's nice. No family attachments to keep you around Chicago? - I... I think I'm like the "eternal bachelor". It just hasn't really worked out the way I hoped it would. - Yeah. - But tell me about you. You live in this big house by yourself? That's got to be a challenge. - No, I mean I'm fine. This house has been in Ron's family forever. They used to bring their kids here for the summer and we would come when we were on vacation, then we just decided to stay. It's been wonderful. You know, Ron took his own life, that's what happened. I'm sorry, Susan. I didn't know that. It's horrible? Are you okay? - Yes, it just... throbbing. I think maybe it's not a bad idea if I call it a night, you know? - Yeah, get some rest. Absolutely. - Let me clean these up. - No. No, no. You know what? Don't worry about it. I've got it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Get some rest. - Thank you. Thank you so much. You're... thank you. - Good night. - Good night. - Yeah. - We're in. - Everything's good? You got everything you need? - I've got everything I need. - Is everything okay? - Well, Daniel, that all depends on your perspective. - Hello? Good morning. Hey, I brought you some coffee. - Thanks. - You okay? Not really. - You must be freezing to death. - I think half the blood that I lost yesterday was antifreeze. - Let me look at this. It's healing a little. Why don't you come in? We'll get some breakfast, okay? - Yeah? - Yeah, definitely, come on. - Okay. - Get up slowly though, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, here we go. Did I look impatient? - A bit. How're you feeling? Just a headache. - Suz, you home? - Hey. - Happy days are here again. - This is Jeff Watkins. He's a friend. - I'm Lisa, I'm a friend too. - Hi. - Hi, Jeff Watkins. - What's up? - We have a lot to talk about. - Do we? Yeah, we do. Listen, you wouldn't mind would you - if we handcuffed you to the refrigerator... - Shut up. - That way you can't away while we go chat. - No problem. I think she's got handcuffs right there in the drawer. - Yeah, okay. Here we go. - It was nice to meet you, Jeff Watkins. - You too. Bye. - Come on, Nelson. - So what? He just washed up on shore? - Pretty much. Now I can tell my clients why beach front property's so expensive. I assume you guys have a thing going, right? Come on. He knew Ron in college. Can you believe it? Well, what difference would that make? I mean, maybe this is God's way of telling you to get a life? I happen to like my life the way it is, okay? - Okay, okay, okay. Fair enough. If you're not interested, you're not interested. But whatever you do, just promise me one thing. - What's that? - Just keep him around past Sunday. - Why? - Well, because it'll take me at least that long to get divorced from Frank. - Ha! Hey. - Rise and shine. - Hi. I'm sorry. How long was I asleep for? - About 2 hours. - Really? - Yes, and mother always said if you're weak, eat. - We must have had the same mother. - Hey, you like Keats? - Yeah. Keats, Stephen King, I just love to read. - Yeah, me too. Hey, I hope that's okay. It's been a really long time since I cooked, well, for anyone other than myself. What? - Caramel pasta? - No, it's pesto. - I'm just joking. - It's green. - It's delicious. - Good. Your bet. Right, okay, I am going to bet 5 red and 8 yellow. What do you think? - You're sure you never played poker before? - Yeah, positive. - So, that means you're probably not bluffing, and since I don't like jellybeans anyway. - Ha ha ha. Okay. My call. What do you got? - What's it called when you have 2 of a kind and 3 of a kind? - A full house. - Okay, I got a full house. Whoo! - Very good. Ron didn't teach you to play? I'm sorry. - No. - Is it better if I just don't mention him? - No. It's... It's just... It's been a long time since I had anybody to talk to about him, or anyone to talk to at all for that matter, except Nelson of course. - What about your friend Lisa? She seems pretty nice. - Yes, she is. She's great. She says that I don't let anybody get close. She's probably right. - Well, you should change that fast, because you're cheating the rest of the world. That's a really sweet thing to say. Thanks. Well, my triumph is complete. I'll clean this up later and I think I'm going to get to bed. I'm tired. - Okay. I'll just be on the boat. - Okay. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. - Wait a minute! Jeff! This is crazy. Just come on back. You can sleep in one of the empty bedrooms. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I can't have you freezing to death on my property. Think of all the paperwork I'd have to fill out. - You're sure? - Yeah. I'm going to sic Nelson on you. - Okay. - Come on, you'll be more comfortable. Come on. Come on, Nelson. Nelson. This is it. - There you go. - It's perfect. - Yeah, I think you'll be comfortable. - I know I'll be comfortable. - Get some rest. - I will. - Okay. - Good night. - Hey, Picasso. - Hey. What's up, Kirby? Not much. - What are you doing up so early? - I was driving by and I wondered if you needed a model. - Ha ha! - I work cheap. - No, it's okay. - Okay. - How about a cup of coffee? - Yeah, I'd love one. - Yeah? Come in. There you go, Kirb. - Thanks, Susan. - Black, just like you like it. - Thank you. - Well, I understand that you have a houseguest. The enormous mouth of Lisa Patterson. She just mentioned that you'd taken in a stranger. Can I raid your jellybeans? - Yeah, absolutely. You're the only one who eats them these days. Anyway, Kirby, he's not a stranger. He actually knew Ron in college. So, he had this boating accident... - Hurt his head. I know. I spoke to Dr. Price. - Really? That's quite an investigation you've got going on? - Well, whenever somebody new comes to the island, I'd like to have a sense of who they are just in case. - Kirby, would you like to meet him? - Yes, I would. Jeff. Jeff. Hey. - Hi. - Hi, good morning. I'd love for you to come down and meet a friend of mine, if it's a good time. - Sure. Yeah. - Jeff, I'd like you to meet a dear friend of mine, Kirby. Kirby, Jeff Watkins. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. How's your head? It's so much better. It's better than we thought. It's healing. That's great. Yeah, I noticed your boat out there. It's a hell of a boat. - Yeah, it's my baby. - You from around here? - Chicago. - You sail all the way from Chicago? - No, I left out of Mystic, Connecticut, actually. - And what brings you all the way up here? - Holiday. Time off. - I'll vouch for him, Kirby. You can release him on my recognizance, okay? - Hey, look. I'm sorry about this. It's just that... well, we like Susan a lot around here. We tend to get protective. - Well, I can see why. - I'm going to grab that. - Yeah, I've got to go anyway, Susan. - Jeff, nice to meet you. - Yeah, yeah, you as well. - I look forward to seeing you around. - Yeah, me too. - Hello! - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Lisa, what's up? - All right, so it's a classic situation, okay? The bottom of the 9th, bases loaded, no outs. The biggest hitter comes up. Okay, this guy's huge, huge. Big, big, big, big, guy. So, I'm playing shortstop, so I'm playing just a little bit... - Good morning, Kirby. - Good morning, Maggie. - Good morning, Kirby. What's going on, boss? - Well, there's somebody I want you to check out, Hank. - Well, that's the first time in 2 years you haven't answered the "What's going on, boss?" question with, "Nothing much, Hank." - Well, I thought I'd shake things up a bit, see if you can put those computer skills of yours to good use for a change. - So, we're running a check on the guy staying with Susan? - Man, I hate small towns. - What's his name. - His name is Jeff Watkins. - Okay. - He says he's from Illinois, just outside of Chicago. That's what I got on him. Why don't you see what you can dig up? All right? - Time to go surfing. - Surf away. Alright. - Hey, listen. I'm really sorry about the way Kirby grilled you back there. It's okay. It's alright. I understand. - But you know what? When he was asking you all those questions... - Hum, hum... - I don't know. It just made me realize how little I know about you. - Well... ask away. - You said you've never been in a long term relationship. Why? - My work, my job, I guess. - It sounds really lonely. Favourite music? - Jazz. - Favourite musician? - Charlie Parker. - Ha ha ha! - What? - It's funny. I mean on some things we have really similar tastes. Favourite sport? Probably football to watch and track to actually do. I ran track in college, so. - Did you? - Yeah. - Hmmph. So, you're fast. - Not anymore. - Ha ha! - Faster than you. - Yes, I bet you are. - I can give you a head start. - No. - 1, 2... - I don't want to... Okay, I give up! Nelson! God. My God! What happened? - He slipped and he fell. - We have to do something. He'll never be able to get out of there! - All right, I'm going to go get him. - Okay. Just be careful! - I'm going in. It's all right, I'm a good swimmer. - Hey! We need help! Come here, please! Please hurry! My God. - Baby! Baby! You're okay? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good luck to you. - Are you okay? Are you okay, baby? Here, here's this. Look, I can't thank you enough for what you did. - How about we just don't do anymore racing, okay? - Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. You're okay, Nelson? You know, I've got to tell you, I don't know what I would have done without you. Seriously, if you hadn't been there. Whoo. - You would have saved him yourself. No... I can't swim. - Really? - Well, not more than a few yards anyway. Shut up. - You live on the water and you can't swim? - It's totally ridiculous, isn't it? - Well, it's okay your secret, safe with me. - Okay. My God, I love that Nelson. You know, Ron adored him. - He's going to be fine. He's an old dog, but he's going to be right as rain after a couple of days at the vet. - Do you think I talk too much about Ron? - No. No, not at all. Actually, I envy what the two of you had. You shared your work and this place. There's only a couple of his paintings in the house, where are the others? Ron kept them in a special place. - Here at the house? - Yeah, well out in the old shed, there's a kind of workshop which I have not dealt with yet. You know everything, everything he was he put into his work, you know? - Yes? - No, it's silly. - Come on. What? - How do you know when you're in love? - How... How do you know when you're in love? Well, I think... You know when something good happens? - Hum, hum... - Something exciting or something that makes you proud, even something that makes you sad, all of it. You know, when you really love somebody, you want to share it with them. - You're pretty wonderful, you know that? Jeff. - I know. I'm sorry. - No, wait... Yeah okay. Good night. Jeff... - Sweet dreams. - Yeah, you too. I mean, he saved your dog. - It is so damn heroic. - Right. - Was he good in bed? - I don't know, Lisa. I didn't sleep with him, girl. - What? Okay, I'm sorry, but the guy risked his life to save your dog and you didn't even sleep with him? That is the most ungrateful thing I've ever heard and as your friend, I am personally ashamed of you. - He kissed me. - Okay, well that's a start. - Yeah. - And... - And I kissed him back. - And then? - That's it. I mean, that's all that happened. - Wow, talk about your raw, unbridled passion. It was nice. - Okay, well nice is good but sex is better. - I conducted the autopsy myself, Mrs. Mandaway. - Yeah, I know that. I'm just asking you to go over the case one more time. - For what reason? - To help me learn why he did what he did. Look, I've been over this a million times. I can't make any sense out of it. He didn't even leave a note, I need some answers. Dr. Cartwright, isn't it possible that you missed something? Maybe something that you had no reason to look for? - Well, we don't test for everything. Only the things that make sense: Trauma, drugs, things like that. - Yes, see, that's what I'm asking you to do. Just let go of any preconceived notions that you might have had and look for anything and everything. Look, I realize I'm asking for a lot. - The only thing we can do at this point is more blood tests. - Thank you. - Janet said you'd be persistent. - I searched probably half the house, - I haven't found anything yet. - Half the house? Where the hell does she live? Yankee Stadium? I'm meeting with Zimmer tomorrow. - How'd you get in touch with him? - Through Daniel. Daniel was going to use him to fence our stones. - Is Daniel going with you? - No. Daniel's finished going places. - Soon as I knew you were in place. - And Zimmer's going to work with you? - Yeah, yeah. Zimmer's going to work with me. He knows what's good for him. - All right, let me know how it goes. - Hey, I want this wrapped up in 48 hours max, Patrick. I'm tired of hanging out here. I'm not kidding, Patrick! - I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay, Bill. Yeah, thanks again. Bye. - Hey, Kirby. I think I got something on that Watkins guy. - What you got? - Well, there's 3 of them in the Chicago area. Jeffrey Michael Watkins is 75 and living in a nursing home. Jefferson Lewis Watkins is a 14 year old African-American in the 9th grade. Pretty good student actually. - Hank. - Yeah, Jeffrey Adam Watkins, 32, Caucasian, single. - Well, that must be our guy then. - I don't think so. He's dead. - What? - He died about 6 weeks ago in a car accident. - Go back and look again, Hank. You must have missed him. - Okay, if you insist. - Anything on the boat: Destiny? - Yeah, I'm still waiting on that. - Okay, let me know. - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. What are you going to have? I'm going to start with soup. - Really? Thank you. Yeah, it's nice. Thanks. - Thank you. - It looks good? - What? What is it? - You look sensational. - You know what? If you embarrass me I'm going to go home and change. - Sorry. You look barely passable. - Ha! Ha! Ha! That's much better. - Okay. - Thank you. - Where is Daniel? - Daniel decided to take the rest of his life off. - This is how you treat your partners? - He set us up to get caught. Somehow I took offence to that. - Well, you prevented his capture. - How's that? - My information is that the authorities were becoming aware of his involvement in the robbery. They eventually would have gotten to him. - And how did that happen? - Daniel possessed a big mouth. Not the best quality to have in his line of work. - Yeah, well his mouth is shut right now and the only way the cops can get to him is with a shovel. - So, when do you expect to have the stones? - Soon. - My deal with Daniel was 9 million. - Your deal with me is 10. - You don't seem to realize that the balance of the power in this transaction rests with me. You can't sell these stone on eBay, you know? - What you don't seem to realize is that the balance of power is always with me. The price is 10. - Call me when you take possession. - It'll be the first call I'll make. - Thank you. It was excellent. - Thanks. You look content. You see what a little company will do for you. - Yeah. So, do you know when you're leaving? - Why? Do you want me to go? - No. You know, I just... well time is passing, and at some point you'll have to go back to your own life. And... I just would like a little advance notice. - I promise. - Okay. - Ready to go? - Yes. - You know, - Let me take that for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - There you go. - Thanks. I had a really nice time. - So did I. - Yeah, it's the nicest I've had in a long time. - Well, it doesn't have to end. There's... - Jeff, I don't think we... - There's a deck of cards in the other room. - Maybe tomorrow, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Wrong number, hot shot. - What are you doing here?! - I came to help you count the diamonds. - Yeah, well you're early because I haven't got them yet. - I'm getting really tired of hearing that. I think it's time we inflict a little bit of pain. - No. No. - What do you mean no? - No. - What do you mean no?! - Not yet. - Cops. Zimmer says the cops were already on to Daniel, which means pretty soon they will be on to us. - All right, then I'll speed it up. - What the hell is taking so long? - I'll call you tomorrow. Now get out of here. Get out of here. - Hey. I thought I scared you away. - No, I just went for a walk. Just wanted to do some thinking. - Can I ask you what you were thinking about? - You. - Because I've been thinking about you too. - Susan, I don't want to push you. I don't want to rush you. - You're not. In. - I'm really happy for you guys. Well, it's lovely. - It's pretty beautiful. - Can I freshen everybody's drink? - Yes, please. - I'll have another one. - So, you're the only real estate agent on the whole island? - You got that right. - You must be busy. - Well, it's been a slow decade. - Most of the houses on the island stay in the families for generations, so not a lot of moving around. - No. - What about you, Frank? What do you do? - I write botanical textbooks. - It was marry James Bond or Frank. - Is anybody else hungry besides me? - Starving. - Very hungry. - I will see to the steaks. - I'm going to go give him a hand. Okay? Excuse me. - Okay. - All right. So, still on for the gallery tomorrow? Medford? - Sure, what time are we leaving? - 3:30-ish? - Okay, that's good for me because I have a closing late morning, so. - Yeah? Who's house are you closing on? - I probably shouldn't tell you this, but it's Cal Buyers'. He's finally settling his brother estate. - Cal Buyers is in town? - Susan, I don't want to get involved. I don't... I don't... - Where's he staying? - At the B&B. - All right, all right. Thanks a lot. Kirby! - Yeah, what's up, Hank? - Yeah, that boat, the Destiny, it's owned by Seafare Waterway Rentals out of Gloucester, Mass. I'm waiting for them to get back to me on recent rentals. - Massachusetts? He told me he started out in Mystic, Connecticut. - Computers don't lie, boss. - Are you sure you don't want some help in there? - No, no, I'm good. - Okay. - I really need to invite Frank and Lisa over for dinner. I'm always going over there. They haven't been here in months. - Well, they don't seem too worried about it. - Yeah, that's true. - The FBI have released this photo of Daniel Garnet and announced that he is wanted for questioning in connection with a San Francisco gem museum diamond robbery last year. They're calling him a person of interest in this case without actually declaring him a suspect. Anyone with any information on his whereabouts is asked to call the FBI immediately. - I think I'm going to invite them Saturday. Jeff? - What? What? - Is Saturday okay? - Yeah, Saturday's fine. - Hey, Cal. - Susan. - Long time no talk. What happened? - Yeah, I'm sorry. I know you called me. - Yeah, I did. I called you. I left you a bunch of messages. - I know. I know and you're absolutely right. I should have called you, and I was going to call you, but I didn't know what I was going to say. I mean, what could I say? - Ron's your friend, he commits suicide, you don't know what to say. I mean, come on. How about, "I'm sorry." How about, "I know what you're going through." Something! - Susan, Ron changed. - What do you mean he changed? - He changed. He and I hadn't spoke but maybe once or twice in months. - San Francisco? - Yeah. See, I stopped trying to figure him out. I mean, it almost like he could be two completely different people. You know, the old Ron that we knew and then there was a Ron that couldn't be counted on. I know this is difficult for you, and believe me when I say I never wanted to have this conversation with you. Ever. - "San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Francisco"! - And you never knew he was in those cities? - Well, no. I mean, not most of them. - Didn't you ever call? - Well, yeah, but I mean, I always used his cell phone. It's easier that way. - You know what, Susan? After all this time, and after all this stress, I don't know, maybe you just forgot where he was. - Maybe. So, I won't be long. If you just want to look around a little bit. - Yeah, okay, but you know that art intimidates me, right? So, great. - Lisa, be brave. - Susan. Hello. - Richard. - How are you? - Good, thank you. This is a dear friend of mine, Lisa. Lisa, this is Richard. - Hi, Richard. - Hello. I hope this is your latest. - Yes. - Let me have it. - Okay. - They're always so wonderful. - Okay, excuse us. - Okay. - So, what do you think? - I think you're getting better with each one. - Thanks. It reminds me I have a cheque for you. Great. - You are developing a nice following and you deserve it. - Well, thank you, Richard, although I'm sure it's more of a reflection on your salesmanship than on my painting. - Nonsense. - Listen, Richard, I know that we've spoken a bit about Ron, but I realize that I never really asked you about the last day that you spoke with him or saw him. - No, you never really did. - I guess my question is, did you notice anything unusual about the way that he acted or anything that he said that might have somehow, I don't know, been revealing in any way? I mean, it had been at least 3 months since I'd seen or spoken to Ron... - 3 months? - Yeah. - No, no, no, Richard, you sold those two still lives of his. You remember? I mean, he was thrilled. - Susan. The last sale I did of Ron's work was at least 4 months before he died and it was for under $10,000. - But I got the money, Richard. - Susan, I'm not saying he didn't sell them. All I'm saying is it must have been through someone else besides me. Mr. Wallace. I'll have to go and take care of those clients. - No problem. ... Okay. Yes? - Mr. Martelli? - Speaking. - I wanted to talk to you about my annuity account. Certainly, how can I help you? - Well, what I want to know is when my husband originally opened the account, how was it funded? - I'm sorry, it's not bank policy to divulge that information. - It's not the bank's policy to divulge where my money came from? - That's ridiculous. - I'm really very sorry. - Well, it's really not a big deal, Steven. I'm assuming Ron used a cheque or a wire transfer. Can you at least just tell me what account it was drawn on? - I really can't tell you that. It's the bank policy. - Okay, well thank you for your time. - I'm sorry... - I don't understand. - Me neither. Let's get out of here. - Hi, Jeff. - Yeah, I know. It's you I want to talk to. Do you mind if I come in? - Yeah, sure. Come on in. - Thanks. - What can I do for you? - Well, we're a small community, Jeff. - Yeah. Yeah, I noticed that. - I'm sure you did. But because we're a small community, whenever somebody new comes around, it's sort of my job as a law enforcement officer to check that person out. I'm sure you can understand. - Yeah. Yeah. You want to check me out? - Well you see, now that's the thing. - Have I broken some kind of local law that I don't know about? - How come there's no record of you in the Chicago area? How come that boat out there that you say is yours is actually a rental out of Massachusetts and not Mystic, Connecticut like you claim? - I don't know where you're getting your information, but clearly the person that you've been speaking to does not know what they're talking about. - Well, then here's your chance to set the record straight. Why don't you start by showing me some ID, and maybe the boat registration while you're at it, please. - Sure. Yeah, it's down on the boat. Come on, I'll show it to you. Here's the wallet. - Aaargh! - Sorry we're getting back so late. Will Frank be upset? - Well, he did have to cook his own dinner, so he might be at the hospital getting his stomach pumped. Are you okay? You've been so quiet ever since we left the gallery. - I am. There's just a few things that I have to deal with. A lot of things. - I know. - Is this an accident? - It looks like it. - Well, pull over! - Hank! What's going on? - Listen, guys. - What? - Look, you're just going to have to move back to the... - No, no. What is going on? - Susan, please. - It's Kirby. - ...move back there... - What is it? - What is going on?! Is he okay. - He's dead. - What?! - Look... look. - What happened? - We don't know what happened. He ran off the road. Obviously he lost control... - My God. - Just go home, okay? I'll call you as soon as I know anything. - Call. - Okay. - Okay. - It's just... It's awful. - I need a drink. It happened on the road from town, maybe a mile from here. It's just... I wonder if he was coming to the house? - I don't know. - Did he come here, Jeff? - No. No. Are you okay? - I'm... I'm just. I'm really tired. I'm going to get some sleep. - Okay. - So when is the service going to be? - Probably Thursday. I'll let you know. I think Kirby has a brother in Michigan. - Yeah. I told him already. - Okay. Just let me know, Lisa. - I will. Bye. - Bye. - Did she hear anything? - No. - I'm sorry. - Hey, I thought you didn't like these. - It's just... It's the black ones. I'm totally addicted to the black ones. - I'm going to make some breakfast. - Okay. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Shoot, let me get something. - It's okay, okay. I got it. It's all right. It'll come up. Don't worry. There you go. What is it? - Nothing. - You seem like you can't find a place for yourself. - I'm just... I'm freaked out about Kirby, you know? I'm freaked out. I've got a really bad headache... and I'm out of aspirins. Stupid? - Well, you want me to go to town and get you some? - Could you? That would be great. - I can probably use the exercise anyway. - Thanks. - Yeah. I'll see you in a bit. Bye. - Bye. My God. - Where are you going? - I'm just going to Lisa's for a little while. You got back quick. - You're such a bad liar, Susan. - I'm not lying. You killed him, didn't you? - Let's just go inside, okay? - Okay. Give me the keys! Give me the keys! - Look, just listen to me. - I'm not listening to you! I swear to God I will shoot you! Give me the keys! - I didn't come here to hurt you, Susan. - I don't care why you came here! Just give me the keys! - Listen to me. Put the gun down. - I'm not listening to you! Give me the keys! Give me the keys! - Please... I'm sorry. - No, you're not. - Put the gun down little woman. - I think maybe we should go inside now, okay? - How did she find out? - I made a mistake. - What about the diamonds? - I don't know. - You don't know. - Yeah. - Well, there's one sure way to find out. It's not going to matter in the end anyway. - What does that mean? The cops think we're dead but she knows we're alive, which means she cannot be breathing when we leave here. - We're not going to hurt her. - We're not going to hurt her? We damn well are going to hurt her! What do you think this is? Do you think we're playing a game here? Are you playing house, Jeff? She lives, we die. You got that? And I sure as hell ain't dying for no broad. - We are sticking to my plan. - Is that so? We'll talk about this later. - You all right? - Why are you here? What... what do you want? - I'm one of the people that helped your husband rob a museum. - Ron never stole a thing in his life! - And I came here to get the diamonds that we stole. - I don't know anything about a robbery! - You know that's not true, Susan. Where are they? Please. - I don't know anything about any diamonds. I don't. Do you want to kill me too? - I think you know I couldn't do that. - I don't know anything. I certainly don't know anything about you. Nothing. - I wanted it to be so different. I wish that you could believe that. I came here to find what we took and I found you. It was supposed to be so simple. - Nothing's simple. - I need you to get rid of them as quickly as possible. All right? If you do anything wrong, I'm going to have to kill them. Do you understand that? - Hi. - Jeff, is Susan... - Janet, I wasn't expecting you. - Yes, sorry just to show up but I thought you might want to hear this in person. - What is it? - I was just going to make some coffee. Can I offer you some? - No, thanks. I'm fine. - Okay. - Steven Cartwright called me at home a few minutes ago. He went over his results again top to bottom, and he conducted a few more blood tests. - And? - And, Ron was in the early stages of acute leukemia. - What? - He must have been diagnosed while he was away. It didn't show up in the autopsy because no one was looking. - So that means... - He knew he was dying and maybe decided to speed up the process. Aww, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you for telling me. - You call me if you need anything at all. - Okay, I will. - Bye, Jeff. - Bye. - Just do whatever you have to do and get out of here, okay? - We're going to get what we came for. - You are pathetic. - This is stupid. It's going to take forever. He could have buried them in a hole somewhere. - I don't think so. - I'm going to go have a look outside. I find nothing there, I'm going upstairs to your girlfriend, all right? Patrick! Get out here! - Kyle. - Over here! - Check this out. - Worth a look, don't you think? - Yup. I'll be right back. Hey! Your girlfriend's gone! - What? She's not in her room? - You got that right. - She didn't come by this way. Susan! That's Ron's old workshop, I'm going to go check in there. - I'll check down the road. - All right. - Police. Yeah, I'm the acting chief. What? I'm on it. - Something wrong, Hank? - Maggie, listen to me. The state cops are on their way here, tell them I'm at the Mandaway house. This Watkins guy killed Kirby, I knew it. - Susan! Susan! - She's nowhere. - She said that Ron kept all his paintings in this room. - Yeah. And so? - I don't see them. How far is that diamond window from the end of the building. - Yeah, it's about a foot. So what? - I want to show you something, come on! You see, there's more space. There's another room. - What have we got ourselves over here? It looks like some kind of an air vent. - We've got to figure out another way to get in. - Let's do it. - It's got to be here. Susan, we know you're in there! - Come on, come on! Let's do it! - Wait. Susan! Hey! - Come on little woman! We know you're in here. Okay, you know what? I got a better idea. - Susan. Susan, please listen to me. If you open the door now I promise you won't get hurt. Please, open the door. Susan! Please open the door! - All right. - No, no, no, wait. - I'm way past waiting man, you know? I just want my share of the diamonds and I'm out of here. - Wait! Kyle! Wait! Susan, listen to me: he'll burn the place down, Susan, he's crazy. You've got to trust me. Susan, you're running out of time. Just please trust me, open this door. Please open this door! Susan, come on, he's going to drop a match in there he'll do it. You know he will. Susan! Open the door! Now! Please! I promise you we won't hurt you! I promise, just you're running out of time! Please open the door! Kyle! I just want the diamonds. - You're out of luck. There's nothing in there. - We'll see about that. - Ron knew he was going to die. I mean, he took care of me the only way he could. He converted them and then the money's going to come to me for the rest of my life. Which is going to be for another 10 seconds. - Put it down, Kyle. - Tell us where the diamonds are. - There aren't any diamonds. - Tell us where the diamonds are! - I said put it down, Kyle. - This is where we stand, partner? - Yeah, this is where we stand. - Your girfriend's gotta die. - Then you're going to die too. Aah! I... I need you to help me. I'm going to bleed to death. - I don't care what happens to you! - Police, freeze! Put your face on the ground, hands on your head! Mister, I'm talking to you! Hands on your head! Put the gun down! - I'm sorry. - Put it down now! Do it now. I'm talking to you! I want to see your hands. No! No don't! - It's okay, Susan. It's okay. You had no choice. There was no other way. It's over. I can't pretend to know why you kept so many secrets, Ron, or why you did what you did. I think giving the money to me was your way of saying you loved me, but it was wrong. So I'm giving back the money and moving on with my life. I'm selling the house, I'm moving off the island and I'm done trying to understand you. It's time, I think, to figure out who I am. And whoever I turn out to be, I do know that I'm going to be fine. Just fine.
