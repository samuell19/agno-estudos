Why did he come here? I don't know. I think you better come with us and answer a feel questions. This is Radio Freedom. Every day, more and more of us are being sent to camps. More and more of us disappear or die. The government call us traitors or deviants, because we opposed its ideology, and then they try to wipe us out, because we believe that we have the right to be ourselves. They'll justify its policy... by talking of a work ethic... community obedience... social conformity. What its really saying is "Accept slavery or die." The time has come to fight back. God don't give up! don't give up! Fight for yourselves... Where are we? - I feel like I was drugged. - You may not know where you are. We are on the way to the camp, are we? Yeah! They gonna make obedient citizens of us. Who are they? What do you mean? Society. I have never been against society. I didn't do any thing. I should not be here. I mean if they put you here. That means, you belong here. Imagine like the best of it. I don't belong here either. Some asshole hold to me for being a whore, which I am not. But that does not mean a damn to them. Well, well, well. What we have here? Come on, boys and girls. Come on, my children. Come on, do not be shy. You too! Over here! Come, come, come. Right over here, my darling. That's it. Come out.

And you... I'll come back to see you... Sour. Do you understand what I'm saying? Head down and ass up. that's what it is! I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch one day. - Keep working. - Yes sir. There you are. As long as you do what I told... as long you obey, you're learning. Soon as you learn, the sooner you get out of here. Do I made myself clear? Do I? Then move it! Over! You must obey me and every other guard in this camp. Without question! Everything that happens here for your own good. One day you'll understand. More trash for you to take care of, Charles? Tower takes Bishop. Check! Your strategy has improved since my last visit, Charles. You seem to be, more misleading. Thank you. I enjoy a good contest. Yes, I must say that I look forward very little game. An unusual sacrifice... I said that you would appreciate it, Mr. Secretary. To get out of the office for a little sport and still you can take carry out your inspection program. Yes, the program. Damn deviates are everywhere. Misfits and troublemakers think they can do what they want. I can tell you now, camps are busted at the seems. I don't know how you going to handle them all. Of course... you don't have that. Over crowded problem, do you? Certainly not. No, I found many uses for them. If you see one you can use, just ask for. Yes, that right there, with long dark hair. She is quite nice. Quite... Vulnerable... don't you know? Getting a bit hot my little flower, isn't it. Are you starting to wilt? I'll tell you what. Maybe you better take off your hot clothes. Or perhaps you like to... a drink? No, please... This all will be fun to watch. In order to be atoned in this place, you got to... give up your balls. You mean that they can't do it. Yes. She only dreams of. After all, he was walking strangely. Cut right off. Was suppose to make a meaner, but just gets really frustrated. Maybe you like doing it for her, son. Your turn, son. Now! Head down, ass up! All right, wise ass. Make you move. - All deviates assembly immediately on center compound. - All deviates assembly immediately on center compound. Welcome. I've been expecting you. I'm Charles Thatcher, the camp master. You must be Chris Walters. Seems you been upsetting some of the wrong people. But I... Make damn sure that you don't upset me. And you will be Rita Daniels. Yes, you'll get on here very well, don't you? Paul Anders. Rehab Camp 42: escaped. Camp 17 released on forged papers. B-Mod Urban Center 6: escaped. You've a quite reputation, haven't you? I've heard a lot about you. You're suppose to run a tough camp. I get results. You are now among a select group. You have been chosen to take part on a special program. You're indeed fortunate. By the time you have completed your stay, whenever that may be... we'll have provided you with the necessary attitude for the advancement. We will make certainly that you have ample opportunity for self improvement. All we require... that you follow a few rules. I'm sure that you will quick learn the routine from the others. Mr. Ritter, the first lesson. Alright, bitch! Sing out! Sir, I'm a deviate, the lowest form of life in the world. The reeducation and, and... behavior modification are my salvation. So, I'm a deviate, the lowest form of life in the world. I will obey the state, parents, and you, sir. Sir, I'm a deviate, the lowest form of life in the world. I will learn to be an asset to society. Sir, I am... a... Dev... - What ?! - I will ... We are all part of a great society... which is the product of many generations of thought. While it is true that mistakes have been made, we now know that this society... depends, upon the whole heart of cooperation of everyone of its members. Oh, please, no! There is no room for shakers, malcontents or deviates. We are here to help you regain the rightful place in that great society. Freedom is obedience. Obedience is work Work is life. That's all, Mr. Ritter. Alright! Everybody back to the dormitories! Hurry up! - Do you want me to bury her Mr. Ritter? - She ain't dead yet, Dodge. I can do it anyway. Have a good day. Bastard! Some of the jobs you'll be asked to do may seem pointless or non-producible however you must learn to do the willing, because the program has been devised for your own good. Your re-education depends on your unquestionable acceptance of any and every order given by the state. You must learn to walk before you can run. When you can respond automatically to discipline you'll be fit to take your places again in our great society. Never forget: Freedom is obedience. Obey is work. Work is life. We'll never finish the basket if you don't hurry up, c'mon! Stop! Mess up my work! Why are you here? Because you are gaining a lesson, and answering my questions. You already know the answer. You should trust me. - I could set you free. - But you won't. It's a possibility. You can kill me. That is another one. But you would not see me crawling. That's who I am. Who are you? I am the one you can't break. I'm what you are afraid of your life. - I'm afraid of nothing. - You're afraid of failing. - I'm not going to play your games. - Yes you are, you are Promiscuity among the deviates while not encouraged is permitted with moderation. However, pregnancy is a punishable offense. Deviants may not reproduce until the deviation is cured and they have been re-admitted to society. Pregnant females will be aborted and then sterilized. Male deviants responsible for such pregnancies will be castrated. Venereal diseases and idle sex is a punishable offense. and homosexuality is a capital crime. So, that's the way it is. Whatever they say, you do. If they say "frog," you jump. You don't stop to ask how high. What they did this morning when they beat that girl. For nothing. You've not been listening. They don't need a reason. They do because they want to. For them, it is fun. But if you do what they say, they let you out? Maybe. Maybe not. A lot of deviants will never get out of here. Except carried out in a box. I... I've been here a long time. And I know everything that's goes on. That's nothing that goes on here that Dodge don't know. Hey Dodge, tell me something. If you are so smart... how come are you still here? I'm going out soon. I get it all planned. You got a bad smell like a dead fish. I cant go in there. Not with them. Oh honey. There are few things that you going to learn really quickly. First of: That is a couple ways out of here. None of them is playing a sweet little girl. Look what happened with you and that guard this morning! Certainly you do have the right equipment. And you better be ready to use it. Now, listen. I gonna give you a quick lesson in how to survive this dump. When assembled it has three moving parts. A self-contained gas supply. Which will throw a paralyzing projectile out of 400 meters. Give or take. 1% accuracy. Mr. Mallory is going to do lesson to his department. After the test. 32 seconds.You manipulate well my dear. Like a part of your body. - It is my own design. - Yes, very nice piece. A suitable, good design, good feel. Perhaps just a little large in the barrel. It's been my experience, Charles... Weapon size does not resolve much. What skill with which it is used. It is also true Charles. But the barrel is only large as necessary to fit the right load. What did you bring for hunting, Tito? Something excessive I imagine. - Of course my dear. After all, excess it's what make life worth living, for people like us. I have a task in the garden. - My God, what did they do to you? - Nothing much. Just little attitude, just much... I'd like to thank you for what you did in the morning. I mean, if haven't been for you... I just let them where to take them shit. It have nothing to do with you. - But we were supposed do do what they say. - No, we don't. - We fight back. - That's crazy. They will kill you. Thatcher doesn't want me dead. He wants me broken. Paul, please. Please don't make them hurt you anymore. Why do you care what they do to me? Why did you cared about me, this morning? I'm surely I need to impress you upon how important is our guests have a successful hunt. It is important for your career. Everything's been well taken care of. I should see personally if they choose suitable targets. Yes, I think it is all a little turkey shoot? Will be well appreciated in the right quarters, - I trust your imagination. - Thanks to you. - To your advancement. - And yours. What about this one? Very physical and, as you can see, resourceful. Could give to one of you a good hunting. Is very tempting, but I think I stay with my original choice. Small slimy one. He should slide very nicely. Stiff, Griff... Mr. Mallory? No, not for me. I still want that girl. Could be an interesting change... No, I see no real satisfaction on that. Show me something else, please. You are a difficult woman to satisfy, Jennifer. As you will know, Charles. Some of the older inhabitants will know what to expect now. For the newcomers, I suggest you watch carefully and learn by example. One of you has been fullish enough to try to leave us before his re-education is completed. In my view this is treason. And will be treated as such. You will remember our motto: Freedom is obedience. Obey is work. Work is life. Well, now understand once for all, that the reverse is also true. Disobedience is treason. Treason is a crime. The crime will be punished. Over to you, Mr. Ritter. What the hell is going on? Another one of Thatcher's ball games. Ball game? You've never seen a game like this before. - God. Is smelling of gas. -Run everybody... It is play time! - Is everybody ready? - Yes! - Is everybody ready ?! - Yes! All right! Play now! Take them up, boy! You know how the game plays. You can get it, boy. Now give me 100, per say! Hey c'mon boy! Boy, c'mon pick them all, boy! I want you to watch it, Chris. Watch! That's what they believe in. Fear. That's what they want us to be. Too scared to think. You just have to obey. Look at them. This is society. No, not anymore. Not for me. Touchdown! Bits the hell of a network television. Alright my children. This need not concern you. Continue your sweet dreams. And you? You think we gonna do with your girlfriend? Each of us. One at a time. And I gonna be first. Enjoy! Enjoy! And now, my little flower, Yes! I wanna taste your honey. No, don't leave. Stay with me. You can take it hard or you can take it easy. You'll be OK. Come to me, my little flower. He is reserved to someone important. Find yourself someone else! Come on, lets go. - May I? - Of course, anyone you like. Quite... instant. Live them alive, but not kicking. - Remote-controlled, 20 caliber. - Two on each the tower. And it always has guards in the gates of the armory. Sounds like you've tough of giving Thatcher tourists a try. May be. Busted out of tighter lockups than this. Me too. Why we don't break up this one? I will, in my own time. - What is it? - A freak. I found him in a circus. Don't worry my dear, he has already eaten. I promised you I'd bring something excessive. - Yes, it is real. - Sure it is. These are genuine too. Daniels, Dodge... Walters. Go on. Take them. They are freedom. Tomorrow you can walk out of the gate and never came back. You'll be legal. Like I said, Thatcher. You can't be trusted. It is surely quite simple. All you have to do is live my guests on the chase, for one day. A little sport. I get it. A little hunt. - You could call it that. - Are you going to kill us? Not necessarily, you might survive. And if you do, you'll be free. - They have weapons, don't they? - Of course. - And what do we have? - Time. A head start. - No deal. - Paul, I can last much longer here. - At list this way there is a chance. - It's a setup Chris. There are rules. It'll be fair. If you are still free at sundown, then the hunt will end. You can go in your way and no one will bother you. - If we still alive. - What if we don't go? Then you will, I assure you, remain in this camp forever. All right, Thatcher. But you really want your guest having a good time. Make it interesting. Give us give something to fight back with. No! - Now, I want at list 3 hours head start. - You should have that much. I want to Griffin with us. You can keep Dodge. I don't need you, anyway. - Dodge don't need nobody. - Griffin has already been rejected. Dodge must be included. Tomorrow morning then. - I'll gonna be waiting for you, Thatcher. - I'm counting on that. You too, Ritter! Just you and me! Not until tomorrow. Rules, remember? Now remember. You will have your own target, so, no poaching. I see you have your excesses as well, my dear. - So many kinds of heads... - They all have their usage. This one goes in very easy, but is very difficult to tear out. And this black one here? They explode. What about white? Let me show you. - Do we really have a chance? Sure we do. - We stick together and we'll make it. They letting me outta here tomorrow morning. Like I said before, there is no camp that hold Dodge. I even got an Id. I'm going to walk out at the gate in the morning and kiss you suckers goodbye. I'm not scared. I've been through this before. Besides, I have a knife. - You thieving little bastard! - You can't touch me! I get loose! Come on! Get in there! Alright, stay where you are! You are becoming a damned nuisance. And tomorrow I pull the trigger. Alright, time to go. No, no, no, no. One at a time. Half hour and of each. You go first. - You bastard! - Goodbye, Chris. Move it! Chris run! I'll catch you up with you latter! I would count on that. You're the last. You up earlier. I didn't want to miss the start. - Who's target is the big one? - Mine. That's not very sporty from you. I thought you said only one a piece. Griffin is not for sport. He is for execution. Would like a Breakfast? Dodge! Mr. Ritter? You're next. - No, that is not fair! - Get out! Maybe I'll stay here. Thank you for having me, Mr. Thatcher! Bye Mr. Ritter! OK Griff, you're next! Come on. I'll be looking for you. Please do. Right Rita, go! OK, asshole, go! Thatcher wants me to work in down the south track. I see you at the finish. This way, Sir. Shit! No, Alph. Let's make the game more interesting. Show me his foots. No no! No, please...! Let's see... big toe? No, no, no. That will impair his pace too much. The little one, Alph. The little one. No no! Please, no! The ugly little morsel. Alright, Alph? Good. Tea break is over. I hope you fucking choke, Alph! I'll go back to camp. - Why are you doing this to me? - Let's give him a head start. No... Too easy. God damn you Thatcher! Fucking pig! Red, this is Thatcher.

Look, we just have to stay alive until the sunset. Bullshit! It's true. Thatcher said so, no one will touch us. Christ! If you believe that, you'll believe anything. Anyway, I wasn't included on that deal. What you gonna do? Attack is the best form of defense. I'll gonna take as many the bastards with me as I can. Please take me with you. Don't leave me here! I can't take you with me, Rita. Look, you'll have some sort of chance if you play the cards right, but... I was dead as soon I left the camp. God please. Good luck. I don't want to run anymore!
