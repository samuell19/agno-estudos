Vincent. Sorry. - Thanks, man. - Come on. Uh, where? Remember the girl I told you about? The girl I met? Oh, the theater thing. Let's go. What're you saying? Here. You don't even smoke. I've always liked these matches. It reminds me of being a kid. I... I said I can't hear you. Yes, but you sound very far away. No, no. I'm fine. Really. I, I didn't think I could be so strong. Your fault. No. No. We, we, we always agreed we would be completely honest with each other. This way, I have time to get used to the idea... ...and to understand. What... What do you mean acting? You're the one making it up? Don't you know me better than that? No. Not at all. I am... I am absolutely calm. You would hear it in my voice anyway. I said, "You would hear it in my voice." My voice doesn't sound like I was trying to write something, does it? No. I've just... ...made up my mind to be brief and I will be. No, let me. No, but that... that wasn't the same. I know, my love. But that wasn't the same thing. You can... You can live your whole life waiting for a disaster, expecting it. It can still break you when it comes. Do you remember that Sunday? Well, it was me who wanted to come. Me and you said they didn't care. Sir, are you lost? Don't put your faith in appearances, honey. Hi. Well done. You were so beautiful. - I didn't see you come in. - Yeah, sorry. Everything takes a bit longer with two. This is Vincent. Do you guys know each other? Honestly, I've never seen her before in my life. She gave you a really weird look. I don't know. Maybe that's a French thing. I mean... No. I don't think so. You're reading way too much into it. Not really. I really think I'm quite... - Hey, darling. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Anybody have a lighter? Oh. Um... Actually, I have one. This is my ride. Let's go. Ooh! I'm not... I'm going to walk. Thanks. Me too. Okay, laters. Which way are you walking? Uh, down. You? - Up. - Ah. I have a train. I thought you might have company. It's just me. No, please help yourself. Thank you. What? Do you want to make love? I, um... I got to go. I'll see you a little later. This is nice. Huh? I said, "This is nice." Yeah. - Hello. - So... obviously it needs to be uplifting and contemporary. Absolutely needs to be contemporary. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. I mean, look, it's New Zealand tourism, okay? People need to feel good. They don't need to feel moody. Do we, do we have anything like that on file? Something we can just I don't know, tweak a bit. Something we could tweak? Uh... Well, I mean, we've got that track that we did for them last time. I mean, they always liked that. We could change the key. I mean, you could go record something now and... And yeah, we'd have something to run with. Yeah, yeah. Perfect, perfect. Look, for the amount they're paying us, I'm not selling myself twice. You didn't exactly sell it the first time. Well, once would've been too much. Lucy, your brother's here. - See ya, Lucy. - Bye. Bye, Lucy. See you, Lucy. Bye. You're late. No, I'm not. Okay, maybe a little, but I'll make it up to you. Deal? Deal. Here. Did you get your togs? Yup. Keep going. Touch your hand but keep the arm stretched. And keep going. Kick, kick, kick, kick. Bigger kicks. All the way over. Nice. Keep kicking. Keep kicking. Keep going. All right, keep going. Just feet. Just do feet. And kick. Kick. Nice. She's a good little swimmer. - Yeah. - Yeah, she's great. Really. She's one of my favorites. She's always so desperate to impress you. Oh... I don't know. I think it's the other way around. Come on! - Uh, what do you say? - Bye. Here. These candles aren't really doing anything. These musicians are so temperamental or sentimental. I always get those two confused. Maybe it's both. Here. I have family in the north of France. I'm coldblooded. Uh, it's okay. I'm going to get one from inside. I didn't know you played. Is that a joke? My mother used to play... ...but I never learned. When I was young, I always wanted to, but my house was already full of people who did, so... I guess no one thought there was any point. And then, one of my parents... Anyway, the piano disappeared. I can smoke? Um, by the window. Here. You look like a... ...conductor sitting in an orchestra with their arms folded. I just can't sleep. The others, they told me. I figured they would. I didn't mean... - Sorry. Sometimes with the language, I... - Yeah. You know, I always thought of love as... ...you know, something concrete. And once you had it, you had it. I don't know. The problem, I think... ...is that it's... ...easy to confuse love with a sort of... ...intense, passing affection. Maybe I'm cynical, but... ...I am suspicious of these people who say they have just fallen in love, you know? They have probably just... ...tripped up on tenderness. I'm going to get some sleep. You should too. Lilly, want anything? Do I...? Uh, no. Thanks. Cool. See you soon. It's just the cheap stuff. What's with your TV? It was here when I moved in. Does it still work? Sometimes. It's a little bit fuzzy. You still have DVDs. Persona. Bergman. So serious. Ah, Bertolucci. I love him. And this, it's one of my favorites really. Everyone in my family thought it was so trashy, but it's the best. Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons. Tuscany. Don't. Okay. I don't, um... I don't get it. A girl can't protect her body? Protect? It's not like that and you know it. Lilly. I just got my period. Sure. Sorry. I read it all wrong. But I really do have my period. Well, even if you do, that's not the reason. We just bumped into Tim and they're playing a gig at Whammy. Um, I'm pretty tired. Me too. I was just about to go. Whatever. Your loss. Are you sure? Yeah. Are you going to keep them? I'm getting a little cold. Vincent. I don't mind if you bleed on me. I do. I want you. All of you. I need all of you. You can't have all of me. Vincent. I love you. I love you like... ...like a brother. What does that mean? I don't know. Vincent? I thought you left. Staying there all morning? I love this the most. Watching someone get dressed. It's more beautiful than watching someone get undressed. It's more revealing. I don't know. I think people are mostly interested in taking off each other's clothes. Are they? I'm not so sure. You know, when, when I look in the mirror, I see a... a creature of... ...desire and vanity. I don't think we get any pleasure from the final result. You know? There is only one final result. You can't help but feel that everything... That everything in between is insufficient. Yes and no. Don't be so quick to judge. It's not easy to find affection. Some people just don't. I think you like to look at things because that... ...distance makes it feel safe. Desire isn't really something you choose to control. You have to be careful... Ownership doesn't follow gaze. Things... ...exist in themselves. Hmm? Just because you desire something doesn't make it yours. I guess the only thing we really own is... dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction and distance. Up close, things always f... falter. Do they? Do they? Really? No. Not with you. C'mon. Close your eyes. Hey, Lucy. Uh, this is Lilly. She's going to keep you company tonight if that's okay. More like you'll be keeping me company. Only if I get to sit in the front. Of course. You can't... Lucy! - You, you are a cheeky monkey, huh? - Ooh! Gimme your seatbelt. Not going anywhere?

Why don't you call the house and tell them you're staying with us tonight? Ah, you got to go up the driveway for reception. - Fine. - "Fine." Do you like her? Do you think she's nice? Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? 'Kay, good. Probably nicer than me, huh? Mm. "Mm," what? - I don't know. - You don't know? Not as nice as you. You're the nicest. All right. Ready? Well... Oh! - Is that enough for you? - Maybe I take your bowl. Why did we choose a tricky way to do it? Thank you. Hmm? Oui. Yes. And some for you. Oh, no, no. Got to wait. So you happy you're staying? How happy? Oh, no, you're getting it all in your hair. Stop getting it in your hair. Oh, no, we made it worse. Do you want to watch a movie later? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? What do you want to watch? Do you want to watch a French movie maybe? Or probably too boring, make you sleepy. - Mm. - Yeah? Do you like, uh, princess movies? Mm. Not really. Mm-hmm. They are boring. - Yeah. - Ah... You like action movies, right? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. What is a good action movie? - Harry Potter. - Harry Potter? - Yeah. - Is that an action...? No, I think that's a documentary. - It's action. - And there was this kid, you know. It's, it's real, right? Wizards are real? - Mm-hmm. - Aren't you Hagrid? You look like Hagrid. A little bit, right? Who would he be? - Don't say it. - Voldemort. I don't want to be Voldemort. I don't want to be Voldemort. No, you're both Hermione combined - with your know-it-allness. - Do you want to hear a joke? Yes, please. What do you call a deer with no eyes? I don't know. No idea. That's good. The French are funny, huh? - Yeah. - Do you know any bad jokes? - Me? All my jokes are bad. - Mm-hmm. I've... Yeah, exactly. - Oh, well, thank you. - Where are they? What? I didn't say anything. Do you think I can fit all of this in my mouth? Oh, my God. She actually did it. To Lilly. Cheers. What? Lucy, wait up! She'll be fine. Let her run. We should talk. Nope. Come here. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. I... I think I ate too fast. It's nice here with you. Can we go in the kayak now? Not now. I have to digest a little, 'kay? Vincent. Hey. Sometimes you have to be patient, okay? I can take her out if you want. No, I'll do it. Just not now. I feel like it. I, I've been reading since lunch. And what about your tummy? It's gone. Come on. Lucy? Lucy. Can you put this on? Ooh. There you go. It's not fair. There's nothing I can do. - Vincent? - Please, please, please. I'll do it. But if I do... ...I'll hate you. Where's Lucy? Lucy? Lucy! Lucy! Forgive me. I know this scene is unbearable and you've been very patient. Please understand that I am in agony. This fragile connection between us is the last thing that links us. Do you know what I did last night? I took my phone to bed with me. No. No, in bed with me. Yes. And then I fell asleep and I dreamt all kinds of things. I imagined that you gave me a ring... ...but it became a different and dangerous kind of ring. A ring around my neck. One that strangled me. A boxing ring I couldn't get out of. And then I was at the bottom of the sea. Yes, but... ...it looked a lot like the room we shared. And... I was connected to you by a tube of air and... ...I was begging you not to cut it. But... you know how silly dreams are when you try... when you try to explain them. But... at the time, they are so real... ...and so frightening. Hey, Lilly, final act in five. Here. Thank you. You know, everyone says that you're the best resident actress we've ever had here. And a year just goes past so fast. There's really no way to extend your visa? I can do the rest. Thank you. You should, you should have told me you were coming. No, I get it. We're over. Vincent... ...we're not over. I, I don't know how I can make you understand. You have this one idea of what love is. It's not as concrete as that. It's not... Lilly, 30 seconds. I can't see the face I thought I had. I like looking in the mirror with my eyes closed. Wait for me after, please? We can talk properly. I can't imagine how hard these past few months have been for you but... ...you can't just shut yourself off from the world like this. Yes. I was just trying to explain it. If you had been lying to me out of kindness, I would only be all the more fonder of you. Yes. Of course. My love, you're crazy. Mon amour. Do you ever have that feeling of being so close together and then suddenly there are cellars and underground passages and a whole town rises up between you? Yeah... Yes. I know we must, but I don't have the courage. Either that or we can sit here for ever and ever and slowly starve. In 100 years, people will find our bones with a strange metal object gripped tightly in our hands. No. No, please. Please if you go there, don't go to the same hotel where we used to go. Because things I, I can't imagine don't exist. They exist in a sort of vague way that hurts less. Do you understand? I love you. There. Well, until... I was going to say until tomorrow. Stupid habit. I doubt it, but you never know. My darling, my beautiful darling. Yes. Yes, I'm brave. Be quick. Hang up. Quick, break it off. I love you. I love you. I love you. Are these yours? How come I've never known about this? They're, they're beautiful. They're just sketches. Toenail clippings of my thoughts. No, don't, don't diminish them. They're good. And all these little fragments of yours are important. Small breaths of expression there, then betray the hand that made them. I nearly didn't recognize you. Terrible, I know. Family dinner and all that. You got to go home at some point, even if just to renew your sense of horror. I thought you were staying out at the house for the week. I was. I just suddenly felt the urge to be around people again and... ...and feel the rhythms of life. But I was wrong. I'm always disappointed. It's complicated, you know? With Lilly... ...and with you. It's not easy. No matter how hard you try, you can't keep your love and lusting to the same. It'd be great to be excused from lugging these bodies around. These mounds of flesh. Burden of being is already enough. I like that. You know and... I had all these dreams and desires of... ...of what my life would be like with her and... It's not even the things I've lost. It's... all the things I thought I'd have and now I won't. No, I imagined us married. I just feel sad. Come here. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You never waited. Yeah, I didn't think you actually wanted me to. Do you want to... ...go somewhere? You know, you should quit. Maybe, but it gives me so much pleasure. Have you been practicing? Obviously not. You know, I hate the comfortability this country inspires. There's like a flat-line contentment of the world. All this space... ...and distance, it's suffocating. You know, I... I feel it pressing on me from all sides. Vincent, leave. You're becoming bitter and confused. Maybe when you leave, you'll realize the world it... ...it isn't quite what you imagine. You know, I read somewhere that... ...the pleasure we get from the sun rising and falling isn't... ...isn't just an emotional thing. It's the moment where our pupils are most relaxed. Not strained by too much light or... ...too much dark, just... ...happy equilibrium. There's not such a big gap between the emotional and the physical. People think there is, but there isn't. It's all connected. Everything is connected. Can we stop here for a minute? Can I wear your shirt? It's only a top. Hey, it's, um... It's me. I guess you've already turned off your phone. I wanted to call to say something else, but I... Um... I don't know. I lost my words. I wanted to just call and say something simple, you know? Something I could... I think you'll always be the person I loved most. And that room was shared, space we passed through. Your tenderness, your warmth. In your eyes, I'll always see myself as a ridiculous man. Lonely. Desperate to be in love with love. I guess, I just... I miss you. But through the thin veil of time, you remain vivid. And all of my pain will never tarnish that or... ...will cause you to fade away. Domestic or international? International. Ah, so you're leaving the island. I'm leaving the womb. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, no bags? Hello, my little dove. Sorry I just got your message now. I've been trying to call you back, but it keeps going to your answering machine. I hope you know that... ...I love you too. You were the first man I ever loved and you'll probably be the last. I wish we had more time but... ...I guess that's life. For a moment, we were happy. And now... ...when it's silent... ...I think of you.
