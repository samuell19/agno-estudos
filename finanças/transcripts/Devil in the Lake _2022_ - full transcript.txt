(Lee Je Hoon) (Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin) (Jang Hyeok Jin, Bae Yu Ram, Shin Jae Ha) (Taxi Driver 2) (All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.) (Some scenes of a criminal nature...) (could make you feel uncomfortable.) (July 2022) (Episode 13) I bet you didn't expect such a worn-out office. That's not it. I was admiring the vibe that I've obviously missed. Is that so? The one who raised me as a kid... had a place with a similar mood. (June 29, 2022: Taxi license) You applied for the job not long after acquiring your license. That's right. I didn't even hesitate. If I'm not stepping over any boundaries, may I ask why you applied for a job at our office? Well... From a tender age, I grew up in a facility. I spent a lot of time alone... which made me wish for people to seek me out. (On Ha Jun) Taxi drivers are those whom people seek out, although we part ways when we arrive at their destination. You're not wrong, I guess. I don't know if our destinations will sync up, but let's enjoy each other's company while we work together. Thank you. I'll do my best. (Letter of Resignation) (On Ha Jun) (President, Jang Seong Cheol) Do you remember the time I caused an accident? You didn't scold me but comforted me instead. It was nice. You were the first person who was genuinely nice to me... in my entire life. I hope you live a long life. Don't work too much. (Taxi Log, Rainbow Transport) (Taxi Log, Rainbow Transport) Yes, good afternoon. I'd like to check the Hi-pass payment log. (Authorized Personnel Only) (Taxi Driver 2) (Victor) Here's the organization chart I've put together so far. The so-called owners are just figureheads, and the true owner remains hidden. From what I have gathered at Black Sun, this man is currently in charge. I have something to add. (Sergeant Jang Jin Ho, Senior Officer Jo Min Geon) Hold on. Isn't he the prick from Cotaya? - I mean, the captain. - That's right. Just so you know, where he worked the longest... prior to Black Sun was Jeongsam Police Station. And the three of them were on the same team. Could it be a coincidence? If it were a coincidence, it'd be highly unpleasant. (Sergeant Jang Jin Ho, Senior Officer Jo Min Geon) That unpleasant coincidence Mr. Jang mentioned... might not be a coincidence after all. Someone created... a camera blind spot at Jeongsam Police Station. What's fishy about that? Because police stations make sure there aren't any... to protect the officers and also the victims' rights. But out of nine cameras at that station, three aren't operational. They're fake cameras. It must be easier this way. To do what? I doubt it's to protect the victims' rights. So where do we go from here? We need to find the recording device... that Journalist Kim gave to Detective Choi. It'd be nice to have footage to go with it. What if we found the true owner in the process? Gosh. That'd be the cherry on top. (Deluxe) (Black Sun, Guard Jang) (Black Sun, Guard Jang) Where are you, you punk? I was hungry, so I went out for a bite to eat. You thought you had time to do that? Get back here this instant. I'll be right there, boss. If you show up there right now, you'll suffer a beating. Would he rough me up when I barely know anything? What could be simpler than making a delivery? You... What's the point of punching someone clueless? And you actually went out to grab a bite. You should be setting an example for the newbie. Stay alert, will you? Hey, you. An outraged VIP guest called. The beginning and end of Black Sun, you say? Is that the best you could do? Don't you dare swing that bottle. Don't be such a wuss. This is for massages. I heard that our doll... was delivered to a hospital and not a hotel. Which one of you suddenly had a pang of guilt? That trash journalist snatched her up. I bet you're embarrassed to say it yourself. That is why... the commission will double starting tomorrow. What? My boys clearly need motivation. Why else do you think something this embarrassing happened? You must be out of your mind. Yes, I am. Since that's the case, maybe I should quadruple it. As if you'll actually share the dough. I know you'll pocket it all. Why that little... Yes, Chief. Right. I'll have it ready for you in the office. Sure. Give me some paper. Write down when you left with the doll... and when that journalist kicked your butts. I want a detailed timeline. Right now! You morons. I don't see anything that's worth blocking the door for. (Authorized Personnel Only) (Authorized Personnel Only) (Authorized Personnel Only) It doesn't seem like part of the club for sure. No wonder Journalist Kim never located this place. Didn't you find it odd, though? (Accessing Remotely) What do you mean? (Restricted Access) Why are they obsessed over the timeline of an accident? (Accessing Remotely) When they left and when they came back. He wanted a detailed report broken down in minutes. (Left hotel at 22:15, Loaded in the vehicle at 22:17) (Authorized Personnel Only) (Accessing Remotely) (Footage of VIP Floor Emergency Staircase) (Left with the package at 21:10 Arrived at the hotel at 21:23) (Accessing Remotely) (Accessing Remotely) Those idiots. (Loading) Done. (Black Sun CCTV footage) What are these? I rummaged through the hard drive at Black Sun, but nothing was on it except for these CCTV files. Check out the file names. Jang Ga Young, Yoo Jin Young, and Kim Hee Young. They are names of women. You're right. The name of the file must correspond with the woman in the footage. But all the footage seems similar to me. It's the same with all the other files. They're seen leaving the club, taking the elevator, and entering the hotel room. That's all there is to it. That must be all the footage they needed. It almost seems like evidence of some sort. Are there men in any of the footage? Only one. Is it Detective Choi Seong Eun? Bingo. Mr. Jang, you were right about this being evidence. But it's only one short video. This was the evidence... that led to Detective Choi's death being ruled as suicide. All the other video files... must've been collected to change the outcome of something. I doubt it was for something good. That reminds me. What's that? It's the same model as the recording device... Journalist Kim gave to Detective Choi. The footage was blurry. But that has to be it since there isn't another model. (MD Windy) - Howdy. - Hello? Where are you? What are you up to? I was out having fun before my shift started. You see, I had a favor to ask. A favor? What kind of favor? Nice shot. (Camera) You're quite good for someone who's bad at this. I mean that you're trying hard. I've been coming by often to practice. So what was this favor you wanted? Are you and Victor close? The recent botched delivery... was for Victor. He's still furious about it. I was hoping to cheer him up when he comes in later. I'm afraid our relationship doesn't extend that far. I'm not saying you should get all cute. Just take the hit for me when he throws a fit. It will be bad for business if I get injured. Nothing will happen since you're friends, though. I hear you. What... Was it you? You should've told me. Maybe you're not actually hurt. Darn it. I know you said you wanted a job, but I didn't think you'd get one here. My friend, I know about the unfortunate event. I heard all about it. Why did it have to happen to you? So how will you make me feel less crappy? Since you know, shouldn't you do something about it? You... You're an employee here as well, you dolt. Number Nine, right? Victor, you're here. That darn little minx. My friend, I'm terribly sorry about all this. Let me pour you a glass. Victor, let's forget about what happened. Okay? Everything will be on the house today. That's what you said the last time... and left me in bed lonely and alone. All right. It's time to pick your doll. Don't you want to score big today? - Open the curtains. - Come on! Let's pick the doll. Open the curtains, please. You know you get on my nerves, right? Good job. You can leave us now. Hold on. My friend, I want you to handle the delivery this time. You'll be responsible if anything happens to the package. Number Nine. He's not experienced enough, so let me find you someone else. But someone as experienced as you... made me sleep alone in my bed. Can't you just shut that mouth of yours? Stop killing the mood. Just get lost. Let's talk outside. The leprechaun keeps thinking he can walk all over me. You'll be paid for your service, so ride with the guys... and call your friend at the end of the process. Don't think about helping, though. Okay? Cat got your tongue? Do you get it? I'm to call him at the end of the process? That's right. Gosh. Are you kidding me? Did no one train you? - Sorry? - Move to the back. Get behind us, you dimwit. You'll get caught on camera with her. - Let's go. - Sure. Follow us. Mr. Kim. Once again, they're headed to a hotel. (Entrance) That again. I can't tell if she's alert or not. What's going on? Should I tell you what would've happened to her... had I not interrupted? She would've been taken to someplace... only to be gruesomely violated. - What are you doing? - Pardon? - Get out. - Okay. What? Is watching her in there getting your blood going? Call your friend. Tell him we made the delivery to Room 1018. Yes, sir. My friend. The delivery has been made to Room 1018. Good work, my friend. I'm almost there too. (I just arrived at the hotel.) (- So jealous. - You're full of energy.) ( I settled it with the agent. - Is she pretty?) ( Why would I get an ugly girl? - You're so greedy.) ( You can spend a fortune like him. - Be quiet.) (Be patient, boys. I'll get a lot of easy girls for you.) ( I like them awake. - I prefer them passed out.) Goodness. Sirs. My stomach has been hurting for a while. Can I go use the toilet? Gosh, you little... You should've gone before the drop. Gosh. - Make it fast. - I'm sorry. I'll be quick. Goodness. ( Be sure to live stream it. - Get a home run tonight.) ( Hey, that won't be safe. - What? Are you scared?) ( More can solve everything. - I totally agree.) (The Korean law is so messed up. That's why I love it.) ( And I love you, Victor. - I'd love to see your live stream.) ( Don't forget the lights. - Give us some lively photos.) (I'll post one after I'm done.) Come on. What is it? Go Eun, can you take her to the hospital? I'm actually on my way up. Gosh. We're here to collect the laundry. - I'll put it away. It's dangerous. - Here's the laundry on the floor. - This can be quite dangerous. - Look at this huge job. Our laundry is badly contaminated. - All right. - Oh, my. There it goes - I wrapped it up nicely. - Okay. Have a good day now. Here comes the laundry. (I love you.) I tell you this from experience. Your clothes must stay clean or others will pick on you. You should have gotten some coffee while you waited. Why are you out here? Well, I was just looking around. My staff told me that the orphanage had closed down. A long time had passed since the files were collected, so most of them were gone. Back then, people didn't think keeping files was important. (Together Orphanage) Gosh. I'm lucky that you were able to find at least some files. The child was there decades ago. It won't be easy to find him just with his name, On Ha Jun. I should do as much as I can. You must've gone through quite the trouble to find these files. - Thank you. - We should do everything we can... to help none other than the Blue Bird Foundation. Do you happen to know the address... of the previous orphanage that was destroyed in a fire? I'll send the address as soon as we find it. The child, On Ha Jun, must be a grown man by now. I hope you find him. I do too. Thank you. - I'll get going then. - Okay. - Drive safely. - Thanks. No! Gosh. I almost died! Bummer. That was so close. I could have clawed you up. You know? I'm sorry, my friend. I'll apologize with my music. No. I'll just go and fulfill my military duty. This is enough now. What does "a home run" mean? What? A home run? Going all the way with the girl I chose... would be a home run. But if I couldn't go all the way and had to stop at third base, it would mean it was just a hit. Easy, right? Don't insult baseball. I answered your question! Don't do that. I'm scared. Why are you scared? Just treat it like a game. Let's do it about 100 more times. This isn't a game! Do you know how dangerous this is? Darn it. Why don't you use that brain of yours and think? Why must I? You picked girls to violate and treated that as a game. Have you ever thought about the fear these girls must have felt... when you did that? No. That was... Why are you asking me to do something you didn't even do? I was just picking girls. The agent did everything! Windy. Come on. You saw it too, friend. You were never my friend. All right. Let's resume. No. My friend. Don't leave me. Don't do it! Don't do it! Come on! Darn it. Don't do it. Do Gi. Mr. Do Gi. My friend! No! My friend, don't! How refreshing. I used fresh fruit. I see. Let's go with 100kg. How much? - A hundred kilograms. - Don't joke now. We joke around when we drink. This is a business meeting. The bishop told me to bring in as much as... you could spare us. Excuse me. Yes. I hear that... a new police commissioner will be appointed soon. And I've been hearing that... my name is mentioned as a candidate. (There are often rumors about the candidates for such positions.) - Go on. - Well, I do believe... I'm their strongest candidate. But... compared to other candidates, my performance could have been better. I ought to lend a hand with that. Right. You can never be too careful. If possible, it's best to guarantee it. I know that the bishop is looking out for me too. You should start going to the hair salons. You ought to look dandy during the press conference. Then I'll count on you. Make sure to... Sorry, ma'am. If I don't answer it, he gets upset. I see. The bishop wanted me to give you as much as I could spare? That's right. The bishop can freely share such wishes... since the bishop does not work in the field. Things have changed for me. I don't think I can do 100kg. Right. Field workers like you must handle such matters carefully. I need 200kg. What? I'll secure the storage location and transportation. Manager On, what makes you so confident you can do this? Enlighten me. I'll use the safest method to handle it. Don't worry. If something were to go wrong, I'll take full responsibility as I'm managing it. (Young Joon) (I'm making calls. But I'm not sure she'll say yes.) Victor, the owner of this phone... He's registered as a director of Black Sun. He's one of the key players. (Sung Ji Hyun) (Young Joon) (MD Windy) At this rate, there must be victims every night. Should we get in there and teach everyone a lesson? I agree. Let's round them up right now... rewire their brains! I would love to do that, but that won't be easy. Why not? I want to get all of them and destroy everyone. I haven't found out how deeply this runs at the club. Right. The figureheads weren't the real owners. Then this will keep happening. We must stop that. How? The hierarchy. Black Sun is strictly based on the hierarchy. Let's take this chance... and give them a real taste of the hierarchy. - Cheers. - Cheers. Congratulations on your new job. To celebrate that, this is our treat. Thanks. By the way, this is my first time here. The vibe here is so different. - Isn't the music great? - Right. Who? The one in the yellow outfit? Okay. Get me two bottles of the special liquor. Thank you. Have a good day. This must be your first time here. Gosh. How did you know? Nothing can get past me. - Gosh. - Oh, my. Since this is your first time at our club, it's on me. - Gosh. - Nice. - What's this? - Look. What is it? Why don't we have a glass? Yes. - Empty the first glass. - Okay. Thank you. Here. Excuse me. Yes, Victor. Did you hit a home run last night? Congratulations. When? How many? Gosh. That many? Everyone with a high pass? Are you paying for everything? You're so cool. Well... What is it? You should get out there. Did someone cause trouble again? - Well... - Darn it. Those punks. Darn it. Gosh. Gosh. Sorry. Wait. You... Hey. What's going on? Who let in these old vendors? Goodness. You should watch where you're going, young man. Hey. You... Darn it. Can I take it inside? - Let's go inside. - Come on. Let's go. - Hey, guys. - You're here. - This is where young kids hang out. - Nice. (Rainbow Hiking Club) (Victor's VIP) (Victor's VIP) (Dancing Hiking Club's 40th Anniversary) - Let's go. - Let's go inside. - Where is it? Hurry. - Come on. - No. - Let's go. Hey, don't just stand there! Stop them from entering! You jerks! Stop! - You can't enter. - Let's go. - Let's go and have fun. - Oh, my. - Come on. - Let's go. Gosh. What a fancy place. - This place looks great. - Let's go inside. No. You're at the wrong place. This isn't the right club. You're at the wrong club! Stop! - Go in! - Sir. This isn't the right club. Well, they all bought high passes. They are VIP customers. High passes? Here we come! Come on in already. Let's go inside now. Let's go and have fun. Come on. We bought high passes! - Let's go inside. - Go! (Victor's VIP) Gosh. Nice! Come here! Young man, scoot over. Gosh. You're imposing. There's a table here. - Gosh. - Come. Didn't we bring food? Let's see. Gosh. The music is so loud. - This isn't fun. - I know. Yes! All right. Nice! Come on. Let's dance. All right, then. Let's go! Hello, sir. - Come here. - Over there. What's going on here? These are the VIP customers who bought high passes from Windy. - Have some rice cakes. - Hey, this place is nice. What is this? - What is this nonsense? - Seriously? - Let's go. - What is this? This is so lame. Let's leave. Close the club tonight. Close it. Yes, sir. Hey, we're done for the night. Close the club now. Close it now! How could you let this happen? Well, Victor asked me to do it. So I thought it was a group of his VIP friends. Did those old people look like VIP friends to you? Cancel all the existing appointments. - All of them? - News travels fast here. Tell them we're closed for an internal inspection. Check the reservation system now. And you will compensate for all the loss... incurred during this break. I don't have that kind of money. Gosh. That jerk, Victor. Tell Victor that I want to see him. I've been calling him for hours to see him too. His phone is off. He must have family or friends. Someone must know him. If you can't find him, get someone else. I found out why they kept these video files. Like you said, these were evidence videos. - Evidence for what? - Come on. Stop that. Stop. These victims shared a few things in common. They all lost consciousness at Black Sun. Then they woke up in a hotel room with a man they'd never met before. So they told the police that they were sexually assaulted. That was the first thing all the victims did. What happened next? Most of their cases were dismissed. And they were charged with making a false accusation... because of these videos. They said they woke up in the hotel after losing consciousness. But in the videos, they walked out of the club themselves... and entered the hotel rooms. To claim that their accusations were false, they kept these clips. Those jerks. That explains their unhesitant behavior. They knew they couldn't be charged with anything. I can't still get over how disgusting these people are. How could they promote rape as if it's some tour package? How could anyone do such a thing? I stopped them for now, but they will resume soon. How could they do something like this in the heart of Seoul? Out in the open too. Victims became the guilty party. And the guilty party became the victim. It's like this club is a playground of evil. Who on earth created this monster? The police arrested a group of people who tried... to launch the largest-scale drug trafficking operation in Korea. They tried to smuggle 230kg... which would be enough to inject... eight million people at the same time. The drug is estimated to cost around 850 million dollars. And the police were able to stop the operation. It's the biggest drug bust in Korea. And it's confirmed that an international organization... that has ties to Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong had been a part of it. The organization tried to smuggle the drugs in... early this morning via a ship coming in... from China and Japan, but police received word... and set up a sting operation, resulting in a huge seizure. Manager On. Why didn't you pick up? Why are you here this early? Did you have breakfast? Did you see the news? What happened? Bring in another breakfast set. Do you think I'd feel like eating? You were so confident. This is why I said we should split the shipments! Just a moment. Let me watch something first. Will you watch it too? I wonder if he prepared a nice speech. The shipment we seized this time... is on a massive scale, almost twice the size of what... we usually seize in a year. We'll fight the war against drugs even harder, to ensure our country remains drug-free. We'll do our best. We arrested eight members of the gang, - and also... - He got a few facials done. Are you mocking me? Don't worry, Madam Yang. I'll make it up to you. How will you do that? They confiscated the goods! Calm down. Do you remember I won... the bottle game last time and got a wish? Let me claim that now. Trust me. Nothing will happen. You're coming in now? Hop over here now! Hello, boss. What time is it? - I'm not late. - There's a training session. A training session? Run to Room Five now. Okay. Hey! Take that with you. Bye, boss! Watch out for things like that. Wrap them 2 or 3 times over. You're now truly screwed. Just answer my questions. Guys, freeze. What team did I say you were? The Evidence Destruction Team. What are you to do with bloody tissues? Put them in the trash bag. Hey. I told you several times to split them up... into different bags for different jurisdictions. That way, they'll go to different police stations... never to be connected, you morons. That goes for you too. I told you over ten times to wipe the blood... with this special solution. No. You did well. I need you to forget like the goldfish you are... so I can come by and get paid for tutoring you. Keep going. Go Eun. Yes, Mr. Kim? Where did the victims in the videos go to report the club? Jeongsam Police Station. They went there because the club's in their jurisdiction. Which station arrested them for libel? That was... Jeongsam Police Station too. You wondered... how this could be possible in the center of Seoul. That's why Mr. Jang said it looked like an evil playground. Don't you think we're getting a glimpse of... what monster rises in the city center... when authorities who should be catching evil... join forces with them? Number Nine. What's with... the nasty glare? Follow me. The chief asked for you. Okay. - It's us. - Come in. He's here. - Come and sit. - Go ahead. - You can go. - Okay. Have a drink. I'm on the clock. You can accept what I offer. Okay, then. You're a friend of Victor's? Yes, but we're not that close. Can you get in touch with him? I've been trying to call him, but he's ignoring me. Have another drink and give me the empty glass. Okay. It's warming you up, isn't it? It's an expensive liquor. When did you last see him? Not since I completed the delivery. There's a lot you don't know. Go on. Drink. Okay. You must... know this. If you want this, buy me a beer. Who are you? What did you give me? It's warming you up, isn't it? What did you... give me? It's fine. Oh, dear. Hey. Get up. - Get rid of him. - Yes, sir. (The Small Bookstore in My Hand) We got yours too. It looks bad. Mr. Kim's down. - What? - What? Hey, wait. Walk... to the entrance. Mr. Kim. Do you hear me? Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. Say something! Don't just stand here. - Help him up. - Yes, sir. Sorry. We're on the move. Don't mess up. Yes, sir. Head to the main junction. (The Small Bookstore in My Hand) Will he be okay? Where on earth are they taking him? I think we'll lose them. We lost them. I can't let that happen. Hold on tight. Careful. Slowly. - Watch out! - Be quiet. Oh, dear. Sorry, my bad. Hey! (The Small Bookstore in My Hand) Where did they go? I don't see them. We were right behind them. They stopped. We passed by them. What? Shoot. What do we do? The next U-turn's a way away. I'll get out first. Pull over. You punk. I didn't like you from the start. Goodbye. Wake up. Wake up. Get out and cross the road... with a smile. Who's that? Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. Wake up. Get out. Get out! He's not dead. Mr. Kim, are you okay? Wake up, Mr. Kim. You need to wake up. Please, Mr. Kim! - Hold on tight, Jin Eon. - What? (The Small Bookstore in My Hand) Darn it. Darn it. Shoot! Mr. Kim. - Mr. Kim. - I'm okay. I'm... Will you wake up? Mr. Kim. Are you okay? - Mr. Kim. - Are you okay? Mr. Kim. Goodness. I'll eat it all up. Here. Go Eun, get over here. Let's eat. It smells fantastic. Come and sit down. Hurry, Mr. Kim. Join us, Kim. I'll eat it all if you're not quick. Walk... to the entrance. Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. You need to wake up. Please, Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! You're awake. How long was I out for? A whole day. Do you remember what happened? It was really close. I have a few after-images, but I don't remember what happened. You really don't remember? Then you won't know how heroic we were. Do you know what a dreadful driver Gyeong Gu was? You were like the people in the video. Do you really not remember what they did to you? If that's too hard, go back to what you last remembered. The last memory? You start from there. My last memory is... That's... I found this. (Taxi Driver 2) (Don't you think we're getting a glimpse of what monster...) (rises in the city center when authorities...) (who should be catching evil join forces with them?) See to it that those who hurt others get punished. I think the last thing Detective Choi said... is a message for you, Mr. Kim. I'm here to pick up the seized narcotics. They stole drugs that should be incinerated and sold them. A perfectly-designed legal blind spot in Seoul's center. It's way beyond a playground. We can't take them down one by one. We must take down the whole thing in one go. Can I see a photo of the new guard? Kim Do Gi was here? The goods seem fine. You punks dare try to stab me in the back? He has to show up. I'm sure of it. Kim Do Gi. I'll kill you myself.
