THE CHESTNUTS ARE GOOD Miss, your friend argued that parents must meet their children halfway, otherwise the world can't go on. I think you wanted to add something for or against this. Please tell us. Franco, go closer, focus on her face. Careful, Baracco, she's weak. But I think that... well, it's true parents must meet their children halfway, but... how do I put this... I told you she was weak. Children should also be... yes, understanding too. Sorry, you're straying from the topic. The question was, "Is family a pleasure or a duty?" Go to the curly haired boy in the 2nd row. He looks lively. Paolo Moriggi. Law faculty. I think the question is wrong. What does "Is family a pleasure or a duty?" mean? Depends on the family. My father is a tram driver, so it's a duty for me. That guy who has an industrialist with a pool, for him it's not a pleasure, it's a godsend! Yes, that's right! Social Democrat! And what do you want? Quiet for a moment! Calm down! One at a time! Let's turn the question around: "Do you feel free in a family or not?" What do you think? - Whaddya mean "free"? If they allow us to be free, it's only to get rid of us! So they can live more freely! - It's all hypocrisy! They pretend to be understanding! They let us play at protesting! Come on! Get in there, now that it's getting interesting! Let them fight! Please sit down! Sit down! They like it like this! They've been preparing all their lives to fit into a cosy armchair! But we want to set fire to the armchairs! - Well said! Calm down, kids, please! Calm down! Franco, top left! Focus on the white shirt! That's the one. ...the courage to say these things! Calm down! Calm down, please! Yes, we must listen to everybody! Baracco, are you blind? That pretty one, top left. Make her talk! Calm down. I think that young lady up there wants to say something. Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Yes, she wants to talk. - Oh, no! Come on, you tell me things. - So what? I tell you because you understand. Well, we'll try to understand too. But... no, I... Your name, please. Carla Lotito, architecture, 2nd year. - Please sit, don't be afraid. Thank you. Ask for her address too. And phone number. Please, speak freely. Well, I say this... I think the question is wrong too. Yes, it's difficult to judge someone or something... when in one way or another, it touches us personally. It's part of our life. Let's take me, for example. For me, family is a fact of love. I feel good at home. - Then stay at home! Yes! I'm fine with it! What can I do about that? How can I disagree with it? How can I judge something so coldly... Yes, something I love. One can criticize, especially if you love the wrong things. How can it be wrong if you love them? Yes, Baracco, her address! How can I despise my father if I love him? Yes... because whatever he was or does or thinks, I... Camera 1, go forward. Let me see her profile. And you too, Daniel. Come on, pan down. Bourgeois! Bourgeois! Bourgeois! Will you let me finish? Get me a shot of her for the archives. How's her legs? Lotito! Carla Lotito! Excuse me. Excuse me. If I may? Luigi Vivarelli. I'm... I'm the director of the show. A pleasure. Look, I need to talk to you a bit. Is that possible? - Well... - Not here and now, naturally. You're busy, I'm busy. When it's convenient, maybe tonight. Shall we have a bite together? - Why do you want to talk to me? Because I'm interested in what you said on the show and how you said it. Was there ever anything more vague and silly than that? - Exactly. I'd like to dedicate an episode to young people like you. Who still know how to blush. And who aren't afraid to support certain points of view. Or are you the only one left? - Well, let's hope not. Then it's alright? Shall we make it tonight? Well no, I can't tonight. Then tell me when and where. It's all the same to me. Tomorrow. - Perfect. Do you have a pen? Thanks. At what time? Let's make it at 6. - Very good. Sunday at 6 pm. Carla.... - No, not 6 pm, 6 am. At 6? 6 in the morning? - Why, is that too early for you? No, indeed, that's fine. In the morning at 6, thanks. You wrote 6 but don't you want to know where? Ah, right, where. Shall Viterbo do? No, at Villa Ada, near the horse track. Perfect. 6 am, Villa Ada. Like the horses. Shall we go? I actually came with Giambartolomei! Ah, right! But I don't care about Giambartolomei! - Neither do I! So I said to him, "My man, either pay in cash or forget it." Would you mind a moment? - Go ahead. Hey! Look who's here! Be right back. Excuse me! - Sure. I didn't come here to Rome to... I have no time to waste. What are you doing? - Can't you guess? What if the police come? I'll say I'm here on behalf of TV. It always has a certain effect. Giovanna! - My name isn't Giovanna. My name is Maria Luisa. You have Giovanna's mouth. Come on, move it. If I get there in 30 minutes, I'll be in time to give the baby milk. What? With a bottle, stupid! Shall I give you my number? Do you have a pen? No. Oh, well, then it doesn't matter. Bye. Bye. "The Early Riser": Music and songs presented by Gianfranco Mazzacurati. 6 AM VILLA ADA CARLA It's 6:05, forgive my being late. Here's the early riser who wishes you good morning. Yeah, goodnight. Bye! - Bye! It's Sunday and in Rome it's clear. But it should be nice in all of Italy. So whoever's planning to go to the sea or mountains, get out of bed. Get up, wake up, lazybones! Soon the streets will be full of traffic. A quick shower and you're off! There was no need to run! I'd have waited for you! Follow behind me! What are we doing? An on-the-run interview? What do you think, Miss, of your parents? Don't make me laugh! I'll lose my breath! Follow behind me! Good morning! So you came after all, eh? Why? You thought I wouldn't? Nice place here, eh? Really nice. Be patient a moment longer. Where are you going now? More laps? Oh no, that's enough for today. I'll take a shower and come back. Hey, are you a middle distance racer? No, I'm racing to the loony bin. What are you doing? Sleeping? Oh, no. Just thinking. Well, I need to eat breakfast. Did you have it already? - No. Then follow behind me! Morning, Felice! - Morning, Miss. I'm setting up. - Thanks. Damn, but... are you expecting people? No, it's all for me. Unless, you... No, I don't want any. Thanks, none for me. A coffee. - Just that? Fine, make it a double. - Alright. Hi, Vivarelli. - Hey! Good morning, Maestro. Old fools who insist on acting like kids. What's wrong with it? Don't you play sports? - Me? A bit with cars. Are you fast? - Not bad. At least, that's what they say. Why do you laugh? Isn't it true? - No, it's just... But you run on foot? - Yes. Every morning? I do now. Because I'm training for the college championships. I don't know yet if I'll do the 800, the 1500 or the cross-country. Hot damn! But wouldn't a smaller track be a bit more... eh? I don't have much speed but my endurance... You know how much vital capacity I got? - A lot? - 4? liters of breath. Look. Wow! Felice, until the young lady is done, bring me one every 5 minutes. Thank you - Yes, OK. Breakfast at my house has always been very important. A ritual? Maybe. Then you, who say you love family, love all family rituals, make me a date for 6 am, shave off 7, 8 km of track and eat like a leopard. And you? You ask me for a date to talk about work and don't talk about it. You spend the night partying, falling asleep and are here only for reasons better left unsaid. And besides, you wear short socks. Why? Is that a big deal? - Quite. And then you have a beard. Which is worse. What's the matter with my beard? Look how nice it is! A beard is always a fake beard even when it's real. You never know what's underneath. And then why do you keep spraying your nose? Me? My nose? What's so wrong with that? Do you have a cold? - No. Are you afraid of germs? - Not me. Then what are you afraid of? - Why should I be afraid? Well, I don't know. But maybe you are. I can finally begin. What do we do next? I'm free until one. Look, I... I do very little in the morning. And what can you do on Sunday mornings? I usually sleep. Everything is closed. Well, barbershops, for example, aren't closed. Finished. Here's what was underneath. Who knows what you were expecting, eh? Well, what do you think? And you? I already knew what was underneath. Shall we cut this too? - Well, let's not go crazy. Thanks. That one? - No, not that one! But it's nice. - No! How should this light be? Well, an old fashioned oil lamp, but beautiful, with stained glass. How old is this Russian teacher? Well, 72, 78... I don't know! Hey, Luigi! Hey, hello! Did you send it to me? - No, not yet! You should have called me! Did you find any lights? OK, bye! - Bye! But does it really have to be a lamp? - Yes! Oh, well. For an old lady, there can be many things... I don't know, even things more useful. A parasol... This, for example. What are you looking for? Better than this? - How gross! You think so? - Yes. But who buys used dentures today? There's a demand... Yeah, probably selling like hotcakes. - Huh? Who knows? A beautiful 1800s chandelier. Let's start with a base price of 25,000 lire. Is there anyone who offers more? - 26. 26,000 lire going one! 26,000 lire going twice! 26,000 lire going thrice! - Go on! - No. Awarded to the gentleman. If you please. What? Did you lose it? Too expensive. There'll be others. Yeah, sure, 3 pages later. I'm going to sit down, OK? A rare opportunity. A magnificent concert piano. An authentic Burgerstein grand piano. Made in France. Dated from 1812. In excellent condition. Probably used by Vincenzo Bellini. Let's start with an absolutely ridiculous base of 100,000 lire. Only 100,000 lire for that piano there? So? - But it's a steal! Apart from Bellini, the weight alone... - Nobody offers more? 100,000 lire going once! It's probably 5 quintals. 200 lire a kilo. 100,000 lire going twice! Come, people. - What? Nobody'll buy it? 100,000 lire... - 105! 105,000 lire! 105,000 lire going once! 105,000 lire going twice! 105,000 lire going thrice! Awarded to the gentleman. Congratulations, Sir! And now let's move on to number... - What? Did they sell it to me? Yes. - Did I do something stupid? ...only one leg remade. Coming from the Saini collection. There was a spinet, a harpsichord, a piano... and a big fat piano! Except that piano has become obsolete. But it's not that big. Damn! It's probably at least 6 meters! Bye! Thank you! - Bye! Sorry, but I couldn't get off earlier. Were you bored? Not at all, I like waiting. No commitments, responsibilities. Let alone waiting for you. I was here in the sun. Thinking. I wouldn't have guessed. What were you thinking of? I was thinking of... I was thinking you wanted them to call me to hang up the chandeliers. Carla! Bye! But did she like it then? - Very much. But even the dentures weren't a bad idea! Go on with you! What's that? Am I illegally parked? Come on. Let's hide. But why? Who are they? They're 2 from Rimini. They come here to buy meat. From Rimini? No, they're at Rome. I don't want to see them now. There she is again. - Hi! - Hi, dear! Hey, if I weren't here, you'd be driving on a scooter for an hour with a chandelier on the handlebar, to wish your old teacher happy birthday. But she was never my teacher. Ah, no? - No. I met her on the train 2 years ago, returning from Naples. She told me so many things. She's a woman completely alone. Why are you looking at me like that? I dunno. Let's go. But how many people do you know? (HI, LUISA!) Enough. But it's never too much. Why? You never know who'll be useful tomorrow. And I know all the people who aren't useful. At least, in the way you mean it. Oh, listen! You have 2 choices: either slow down or drive with both hands. Which would you prefer? Ooh! It's almost noon already! Why? You have something else to do? I offer you my life, Oh, my Lord! I offer you all of me. All of me. All of me. All of me. You gave us life... among the truly living... and you never took your love from us. Wow, it's nice. I told you so. Think of Giulio! Hear us, Lord! For my poor mother! - Listen to us, Lord! Keep my baby close! - Listen to us, Lord! For Martin Luther King! - Listen to us, Lord! For world peace! - Listen to us, Lord! Protect my father's soul! - Listen to us, Lord! But you talked as if he were alive? Will you help me? Eh, I'm coming. Put it there. Where do you live? - On the 2nd floor. With who? - By myself. My mother lives in a town near Salerno. Bye. Bye. But let me say, it's not true that you do little in the morning. I was very happy with you. And you? - Well, I... I really had intentions better left unsaid. Oh, well. What can one expect from one morning? Not even a kiss. A kiss at 1:15 has never been tradition. But didn't you have 4 and a half liters of breath? Bye. Lotito! Now you won't say, "Follow behind me", eh? Bye. To hear your words again. Those words that I hear no more. The world around us did not exist... because of the happiness you gave me. Sorry, but I couldn't go back to my house. I'LL EXPLAIN LATER! Let me sleep!!! Teresa. Hello? Swept away by sex, we didn't even say when we'd meet again. Tomorrow. OK? Pick me up at 11:30 tomorrow morning at the university bar. Will you stop with these mornings? Alright, bye. - Bye, eh? What beautiful legs! Idiot! Oh, sorry, excuse me. I'm the idiot. You're looking for Carla, right? Come on in. Well, we were really supposed to meet at the university in the morning. But since I have to leave... - Ah, have a seat. Yes, thanks. I have a lot of suitcases. I just woke up and I don't even know where I am. Can I put them here? - Go ahead! It's not my house. I'm very late too. Come on in. Hey, by the way, do you make movies? Is it obvious? Yes, I work in TV. Even Carla's becoming an actress! I can't really see Carla in that business of whores! You have a fine concept of art. No, I've a fine concept of whores. Besides, I'm an actress too. Congratulations. - Thanks. But would you be a friend of Carla? Hell no! I'm Teresa: The sister. Carla's famous sister. I didn't know Carla had a sister. And famous too. But famous how? As an actress to be. Well, you can tell her I'm here. Carla? But Carla isn't home. Oh, no. Yeah, I should've told you right away. Carla's not in. She's waiting for me a the theater at 9! God, I'm still half naked! What time is it? 10 to 9. Oh, God! Wait a second, eh? Look, you'll give me a lift, OK? Besides, you wanted to see Carla... Does Carla have more sisters or brothers? Oh, no. It's just the two of us. Thank God. THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION Look, with all that equipment, why don't you do a TV report while you're at the theater? It'll be an interesting premiere. Groundbreaking. Can you help me, please? You answer it. If they're looking for me, I'm gone. Hello? Who? Your mom? But look, you must be mistaken. Teresa, there's a little girl who's asking to speak with her mother. Hi, honey. What are you doing? And is dad there with you? No, no, I can't tomorrow. Yeah, I know it's Thursday. But mom works tonight and I'll be late. I really can't. Come now, don't cry. And next Thursday we'll eat together and I'll take you to the movies. Are you happy now, eh? And did you have a bath? You want us to say the prayer together? Come on then. Jesus, I place myself... in your hands. Hold me tight... until tomorrow. Go to sleep. Go to sleep now. Yes. Good night. Bye. Good night. You like them? Uh, well... They're mine. Yes, I made them myself. A truly sad failure. Poor Carla. I filled up her house. She can't tell me no. Is this yours too? - What is it? "The Sexual Revolution"? No, that's Carla's. I made my own revolution without any textbooks. I'll get my purse and be right there. Hurry up, let's run! Come on. - Shall we leave the bags here? How long have you known Carla? She never told me about you. Hurry. Come on, hurry! I'm frightfully late! Third gear! - What the hell are you doing? Fourth. - Knock it off! Behave! Third. - Will you calm down? Hit the gas! Hit the gas! Will you cut it out? Look, I'll drop you off here... Damn it! - The theater's in the back. Where? I never knew a theater was here. Well, it's really a cellar. But what did you think I was? A conventional actress? I told you. This is new, important. We've been working for 3 months, almost without pay. I'm terribly scared tonight. Come, gimme a little kiss for good luck. Come on! I won't tell Carla. Stop worrying. Why didn't you come a ? an hour earlier? Luigi! Come here. Would you mind moving a little? - Excuse me. Are you here because of the TV? I have my sister acting here. Yeah, I know. She dragged me here. I came looking for you at your house. You met Teresa, eh? Yes. She's a little weird sometimes. And this is a stressful time for her. But she's a very good girl. She's not like you at all. We're very close and I love her very much. How lucky that you're here! I'm afraid, agitated, you see. Worse than if I had to act. But the offer came to him...! - From the Director-General! One day he was called...! - By the Director-General! And he was raised to the office...! - Of Deputy-Deputy-Deputy- Sub-Sub-Sub Director-General! Fucked per omnia saecula saeculorum (for all time)! Amen! Very kind... ladies and gentlemen, who keep your stony asses firm in these biting chairs, only we know what you really want: maximum performance and minimum expense! You would also like to know why any product, costing the factory 10 lire, they make you pay 100 lire! You're wrong! Where would the American liberation of Vietnam end up? However, our specialized departments have entrusted Reverend Pollock with an investigation into sexual mores which have the greatest influence on consumption! Taking into account the concrete, abstract principle, both analytical and synthetic, operational, passive of the average guy! If you may, Reverend Pollock! First: It's false that masturbation is harmful to the psychophysical balance of the individual. Can you believe this stuff? - Male or female, whoever masturbates is always a good consumer. What should I do? Start filming? - Second: Homosexual relationships were found to be positive and to be encouraged, in the case of male homosexuality, as it does not decrease in its subjects the ability to purchase. It is negative in the case of female homosexuality, as this ability decreases. Excuse me! You! Who are you? A lesbian! I've decreased my ability to purchase. Should I shoot? I apologize, Reverend. So this one who's all dressed up: shoes, socks, pants, jacket, and even the tie, has maintained his purchasing powers. A pederast! If you're not a pederast, take off your clothes! And you, Ma'am, what are you waiting for? Undress! It's obvious she has lesbian tendencies! It's useless that she tries to hide them under a miniskirt! He who dresses is fucked! Pants are the first link in the chain! Take off your pants and you'll break the chain of consumption! Shirts are your condemnation! Each purchase is a principle of war! Sten aims at the masters of the world! Are you the manager? Give orders to lower the curtain. Impossible! There's no curtain. See for yourself! Get off the stage, please! Off the stage, kids! No fuss! The show is suspended! But can't you see it's not finished? We're still half dressed! We must be naked! You get undressed too. Undress! Clear out, please! Clear out! What's he doing? Is he crazy? Pigs! Hangmen! Killers! Get off of me! Stop with your violence! It's an abuse against the Constitution! A shame! This is the law of the masters! Sell-outs! Creeps! Cowards! Teresa! What are you doing? - This is interesting! But she's my sister! I don't want you to! Alright. Will this satisfy you? There you go! There! Is that better? Sell-outs! Sell-outs! Teresa! Murderers, let go of me! Hey, beautiful. How are you? Shitty. And your beard? Eh, I took a vow. Mimmo, half whiskey and the phone. - Right away, Dr. Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, evening, Counselor. Evening. - Evening. Hello, Captain? Yes, it's still me. Well then? Again? But even at the police station? What an idiot! What do you mean "flipped out"? Yeah, but don't take her seriously. She's just a poor asshole like those... Exactly! Yes. Well, what matters is that... Yes. Thank you. Yes, I understand, Captain. Counterfeiters? Of course, I'm interested! Catch 'em and leave 'em to me. A minute on TV, an interview, and a close-up of the confiscated stuff. OK? Yes, goodbye, Captain. Goodbye. Good luck, eh? Mimmo! I'll see you later! - OK, Dr. All set: They'll release her tomorrow. She won't even be charged even though she tried her darndest. Want something to drink? - No. See what it means to know all the useful people? And the performances? - Well, those are suspended for sure. I doubt it'll be a great loss to culture. Daniela! - What? Leaving already? We're going to Ferrante. Want to come? Want to go? Everything's fine now. She's not an asshole. No? What is she then? How can you judge a person like that... without even knowing her? A lucky guess. And I usually guess right. Come on, let's go. I'll take you home. Have you ever looked at her wrists? - No. Two lines here and two here. Are they scars? - Yes. You know what they call her? Lieutenant. And now you're afraid she wants to be Captain. She's a... I don't know... she's a ... She's an asshole. Sorry, but I'm saying this to put you at ease. Even if she tried it again, she'd never succeed! She's like one who goes into a pharmacy and says, "Give me a dose for suicide." Yeah, because the only goal of people like her is to piss off humanity! And she pisses off you, her husband, her mother, her daughter and me! You? - Yes, me. By extension. Forgive us. We ruined your evening, eh? No, I was just only saying. I'm sorry too. I'd always like to be with you just like this morning. After all, this evening wasn't scheduled. Maybe another time. Bye. Bye. Carla! I swear, it's no excuse to go up, but I left my bags upstairs. I'll get them and run. If not, do this: put them on the landing outside the door. What are you doing? I'm looking at your little shrine. What's that on your father's head? What a strange cap. Was he a judge? Yes. But later he left. Or maybe they kicked him out. Don't know. Then he went into business. Which kind? The wrong kind. He trusted everyone too much. He was one of those men who could seem incapable, wrongheaded. Weak. But when they're gone, you realize how important they were. Why did he die? I often ask myself this too. But maybe you meant what he died of? - Right. He suffered from his heart. But it wasn't that bad. Look. I'll show you something. He wrote it to me one night when I was a little down in the dumps. He left it on the bedside table... while I was sleeping. Nice. Well written. What about that iced tea? - Ah, yes, sorry. Have you ever tried to quit? To throw it away? What a vice! Well, then let me confide in you. Something I've never told anyone. It's not a vice. It's empty nose syndrome. "Rinoverosis. Nasalphobia." But listen, in your father's note, he says at one point that the "chestnuts are good". What does that mean? - Roasted chestnuts. Those that you buy in winter, on the street. You put them in your pocket to warm your hands. He meant that the simplest things are the best. He liked everything. Whether it rained or was sunny, not a single day passed he'd say, "What a beautiful day." I believe he's never been bored in his life. He was someone who always managed to find the best in the people he met. What if there is no "best"? There is. There always is. Give me a break! 90% of people, are not even worth meeting. Meanwhile, you call them people, I call them persons. And then I try to collect them, like stamps and coins. Then we can make some exchanges. I'm full of scraps and phony pieces. Who knows? Hello? What? Ah, yes, thank you. They woke us up. He says it's half past five. Damn! But you know this is the first time I've spent a night with a woman, just like this: chatting. Like with a friend or a schoolmate, right? Well... Don't take it to heart. - See how difficult it is to be a woman today? You think you've offended me and instead you said a very nice thing. Alright, fine. Go run. Bye. Ah, I'm giving up this morning. I'm going to sleep. But you had to leave. At what time? Oh, there's time. I leave at 11:50. And you've been carrying your bags since last night? - I'm an optimist. I thought maybe coming here last night, I wasn't going home. Well, I think it's becoming difficult to be a man today too. Where are you going? - Milan. A nice job? - Who knows? When do you come back? - One week, a day more, a day less. Better a day less. Would it embarrass you to know that I'm waiting for you? - As a friend? Or something else? As I like it. Bye. One moment. My suitcases, damn it! Bye! See you soon! - Bye! Hey, a mom and newborn are there too. Is that bad? - A newborn? It's terrible, guys. There always a pair on the list of victims. And we got a Protestant priest and wife, who are almost worse than a sports team. Let's change planes, Luigi. We are full up with the doomed. I think I'll change cameramen 'cause you're the one who looks doomed. What are you saying? This time, I look like 50 million. What is he doing? Insurance. Getting the family settled. Wait a bit. How much does one like his cost? Rome to Milan, 50 million: 3700. - So little? What do I have to do? - Here. Fill in the form. Pay and send it to the beneficiary. Thanks. - You're welcome. Looking at you, I better make it 100 million. What are you doing? I've been waiting for an hour! Come and give me a hand! Fine. Sorry, I had completely forgotten. But today, I don't really want to study. Well, you didn't feel like it yesterday also. Look, what a beautiful day. Shall we go to the sea then? - Yes! Miss! This came. - Ah, thanks. The listed company insures Mr Luigi Vivarelli for the Rome-Milan trip. In case of death: 100 million to be paid out to Carla Lotito. What's that? Any news? It's a love letter. Worth 100 million! 2:18.4. And in your tracksuit! What's the matter with you? I'm drugged! Damn, what are they doing? - Going home. They didn't see. What do they know? One more time, Tina. Too bad, a friar on a bike was coming. Good, else he would've stopped. Hey, there's a fat guy over here. Go on, Tina. He's stopping. Hey? Hey! He's not going! On his face! Aim on his face! What? Aren't you going? Ah, well. Excellent, how did it come out, Lou? - Perfect. Lou! 3 women are coming. Evening, gentlemen. - Evening. Good evening. - Hello. If you please. - Thanks. What shall we do? Go to the movies tonight? But it's late. A young lady came and left this note for you. Luigi Vivarelli, at whatever time you arrive, call me at 2. Carla. Matteo, look, I got something to do tonight. Oh, well, see you tomorrow. What time did the young lady arrive? - Around 9. Alone? - Yes, she went right up. Wouldn't you have a single room? - Wait. Yes, the 46. Then I'll stay in the double and the lady can have the single. Very well. The young lady at 46, 4th floor. I'll see to your luggage. Here you go. - Yes, thank you. You don't really mind, do you? But you owe me one. Sweetie, you gotta spend your allowance now and then, right? Else, go sleep with Matteo. No, don't wake up. Sleep, sleep. No, no, Luigi. No, no! What the hell! But... What are you doing? Calling the police? But then why did you come? Alright, fine. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. You just hafta say so. Just hafta make it plain. Time to get myself together. But... but I ask you again: Why did you come? Because... because... Because when I got the insurance letter, it seemed a gesture that was so... yes, so nice, that I felt like I had to see you. Right away. Open it and make up an excuse. Go on. And take the opportunity to ask for a chamomile. We always take it in turns, eh? One eats... and the other watches. Yep. I can't tell if you're angry, offended, disappointed... or something else. What would that something else be? Well, I don't know. Some other feeling. Because those don't make sense to me. Yes, I know, I was a bit excessive. Even ridiculous, if you like. But it seems impossible that you... you won't try to understand why. It didn't occur to you, for example, that for me... it could've been the first time? Excuse me. Didn't that occur to you? - Of course! And? And I'm increasingly convinced it should be made mandatory. Like the polio vaccine. As soon as your born, a quick scalpel cut, maybe blessed, and then you'd all be finally vaccinated against this hang up. Will you dance with me? I... I wish it were with you. I think I wanted to right away. Ever since you cut your beard. Only, I wish it was as important to you, as it is for me. The 3rd? - No, I'm on the 2nd. We'll be together all day tomorrow. I work at nights anyway. Bye. Bye. Bye. Good morning, Miss. Just put it here, thanks. Thanks. - You're welcome. It's 5 o'clock and I don't have the courage to wake you. They're sending me to Germany for urgent business. I HOPE I MISS THE PLANE. If not, see you soon in Rome. Enjoy your meal. Forget the tip. I'll take care of it. Here. - Thank you. Go on, get inside! Didn't go well, eh? To the station? - No, Hotel Rosa, on the other side of the Duomo. - OK. Rai TV, good morning. Dr Vivarelli? Who's calling, please? One minute, I'll find out. I'M NOT IN TO: PURICELLI, CAPPELLARI, DE BLASI, CARLA LOTITO, I'M IN GERMANY. YOU KNOW NOTHING. No, Dr. Vivarelli is still in Germany, Miss. I don't know, they're constantly moving. You're welcome. Good morning. Go, Nando! Pull it, Nando, come on! Slowly! Slowly! Come on! Come on. Go on! Come on! Slowly! Take it easy now. Slowly. Go on. - Will it hold up? Eh, hopefully, Dr. What can I say? We'll see. What? Do you doubt it? - I don't know! Go on now! We're almost there. Easy! Easy now! That's it. Yes? Luigi! - Go on. Hello, Luigi? - Go easy. Hello? - No, I'm Armando! But isn't this the Vivarelli house? Yes, but he's not here! He's abroad! Who are you? Me? We're the porters! We're bringing up a piano that looks like a ship! Please, be careful, eh? Don't let it get damaged. The only one who doesn't get damaged here is Dr Vivarelli! We mounted a hoist on the terrace, that not even Leonardo da Vinci...! Yes, OK. - Hey, wait! You wanta leave a message? - No, thanks. No, I'll write it for you! I'll leave it on the piano! No. - Whaddya want to say? No, nothing, thanks. Good day! Nothing? What do you mean "nothing"? Come on! Come on now! That's the way. Raise it! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Yay! Yay, Carla! Yay! What are you doing? Are you stopping? Are you crazy? Run! - Carla, where are you going? It's the other way! Did they call you into the parlor? Where have you been? Think about running! We'll talk later! I've been looking for you for months! You never show up! Louder! We wanna hear! We wanna hear! Fine, fine... Bye! Luigi! Luigi! He dumped you! Get married! Luigi! Excuse me? - Yes? - Moviola 10, please. Over there. Sorry, but we need to talk. Make the cut at the speaker. The sound effects are good there. What? Were you chased by fans? What's wrong with you? - I want to know the truth. Where have you been all this time? You don't know? In Germany, to work. I don't believe you. Where have I been all month? In Germany. See? And in one month, not one phone call, not even one postcard? I lost my notepad. 5 years of addresses. I didn't know what to do. And I believe you've always been here. But I came back last night. When did I get back? Yesterday. Last night? Last night. Convinced? He says what you want. Who should I get to tell you? The Program Director? Would that do? Go on, upstairs. Engineer Ballini. Go announce yourself. What are you? A fool? Carla! Where are you going? Is this a joke? - No, it's very important. How will I look? You'll make the whole station laugh! And I got laughed at by the stadium! - But is it my fault you're crazy? I went crazy waiting for you. Looking for you every day. Tell me, which door is it? I'll ask him nicely. I'll explain myself. Don't worry, I won't make you look bad. But now... now I need to be sure of you. To understand who you are. Fine. I'll take you there. Now this has become serious for me too. What you force me to do is very insulting. Here, this is the door. What shall I do? Knock? I'll knock. But remember, I was in Germany. I lost my notepad. I came back last night. Swear it. No, now... - No, forget it. I believe you. Good for you! Because look: You would've gotten little information from here. Now, I'll tell you the truth. I never went to Germany. I've been in Rome, hidden like a mouse. But why? To escape. A run of the mill escape. Rockets ignite and escape from gravity. And you're the gravity! "It's the first time. It's something important, permanent..." And I want to be insignificant and temporary! And also a liar! Is that OK? Let's go. But it's impossible. Since I've met you, before doing anything, I find myself thinking, "Will she like it? Will she think it right? Will she approve?" "Will it hurt her if I order this cappuccino?" I gave the porter 15 pairs of almost new short socks. Am I nuts? Who makes me do that? But... but you came back to find me. - Yes! Because... because I wanted to make sure who you are! And I did. Right away. Why should I change? Let me live as I please. You like chestnuts but there are worms inside them too! What do you know about life? The world is like me and not like you! You wanna see what people are like? Oh, pardon,"persons"? You wanna see? Come on! Get up. Is at the beginning? - Yes. We did this experiment in a central street in Milan. One of our actors, simulating a sudden illness, collapsed on the sidewalk. With the car hidden, we filmed a record, which in its absolute authenticity, we do not hesitate to define as disturbing. Look at these "persons"! Try to find the best in them! Put these ones in your collection! A nice fat man, eh? But see how quickly he spins away. Pay attention, eh? There it is. Yay! Quite the bersagliere! See? And now meet these ladies of charity. Two mothers. Housewives, as written on their IDs. They'd love to stop, but it's better not to bother, eh? Someone else will stop! You see? Want to take a closer look? Let's replay it. Besides, maybe he's just drunk, right? My God! Pay close attention now. These two don't make war. They make love. Lucky them. They love each other. They love each other but they don't stop. The Red Cross also goes away. Ooh! Look at that nice old lady! Cute with her doggy, right? And this other one. He's a businessman. Maybe a judge. He looks serious, important. Who knows what's inside the bag. And here's a rough truck driver. An honest worker. And yet it's not over. Here comes a Samaritan in a Mercedes. Citroen. Stop it! You're worse than they are! You have no respect for anybody's feelings! Will you stop it with this privilege of feelings? Let's begin to respect non-feelings, which are just as important! Don't bother us! Don't distress us, for God's sake! It's not that you don't have feelings! You just don't want them! Come on, let's see this cut. Hello, Maria. - Hello, Miss. Is my sister here? - No, she took the girl to the gardens. But today isn't Thursday. Her husband brought her this morning. - Ah, thanks. Frida! Aunt! Hi! What did you bring me? Nothing today. - How are you, Carla? Wait, Frida. Leave your aunt alone. I've been calling you but it was always busy. I unplugged the phone because... I'll tell you later. - Come on, Mom! Be good, Frida. Last night there was a crazy scene, so disgusting, one could barf. But... - Come on, Mom, let's go play. Please, Frida! Wait, Carla or she won't let us talk. Let's go on the rides. Come on! I dumped him, Carla! Out! Gone forever! Can you give me 5 turns? I'll pay after. - OK. Mom, look at me! - Yes, let's have fun. Aunt! With 5 turns, that'll give us a little peace. How beautiful. How good it feels. How liberating, Carla. How I can breathe. Why didn't I do it earlier? What did it take? A nice clean cut. Done. Over. And you get back 10 years of your life. I'm starting again from scratch. What have I been to men up to now? An excuse. The only one who might have taken me seriously was my husband. And I couldn't live with him. Who knows? After all, I'm still young, right? - Mom! Mom! But Carla, what's the matter? You're not well? No, no. What is it then? Luigi? He left me. Or maybe, I'm the one who left him. I don't know. Was he important? I'm... Teresa, I'm desperate. Come on! With so many cute boys around, somebody like you... - Somebody like me? That's what I want to know. Teresa, tell me the truth. What do you think about me? Maybe... maybe it's really me who... Maybe I take things too seriously. I'm annoying, demanding, old-fashioned, wrong! Is that true? Tell me. And you've come to ask me, who has always got everything wrong? But I am a poor wretch. What do you want me to tell you? You're an extraordinary girl, Carla. Whenever I'm in trouble, the only thought that consoles me is having a sister like you. And who doesn't understand, appreciate and want you, isn't worth a damn. That's not true. That's not true. Carla, why don't we go home to mom for a few days? We haven't been together in a while. It would do us both good. Eh? We'll leave tomorrow morning. You want to? Oh, my God, how I suddenly do want to see mom! And all of them: Aunt Fanny Aunt Rosa, Antonietta, Lucia. Don Raffaele. For Aunt Fanny, I'll bring that mustache cream which is terrific! This time, we'll grab Don Raffaele by the collar and say, "What are your intentions towards mom? Will you marry her or not?" We can also take Frida, eh? You think my husband will give her to me for a week? Oh, yes. I'll call him. I'll talk to him, you'll see. Oh, that's great! Frida! Frida! Frida, let's go to grandma's! We're going, Frida! We're going away! I have just returned from Germany. I lost my notepad. 5 years of addresses. Sorry, if I didn't even send you a postcard. Do you swear it? But... What are you doing? I come and you leave? Look, I'm not giving up, you know? I'm coming with you! Come on! Teresa! Frida? - Hi, Aunt. I'm boiling milk! I'm all out! Where's mom? Teresa? But where is mom? Mom is out. She wrote you a letter. It's over there. I don't think we're leaving. Where's the letter? - Here it is. Take it. I should have expected it. She's flown the coop, eh? You were right, she's a jerk! Nothing can be done. And I always kid myself. Instead, there it is: She leaves the child to go with that retard. If not him, then it'd be another. And she doesn't even call. Nothing. Two lines and she's gone! I could slap her! Maybe she's not having fun either. Aunt? Is it true that we're not leaving? What do you mean? Of course, we're leaving, right? Me, you and Aunt Carla will go! Sit here. Did you pack your suitcase? - Yes, mom did it for me. In the meantime, get clean. You look like you've fallen in the jam. And where are your clothes? - There. Ah, great. Just these? - Yes. You don't want to go in your undies, no? What a nice sweater this is! Really nice! It's red, eh? - But who the heck are you? Dr Luigi Vivarelli. Pleased to meet you. Why don't you cut off your mustache? Hey, Carla! Hi! Hi! Come on. Carla has arrived with her boyfriend! Hey! Hey, Carla! - Carla! Say hi. - Hi! Hi! She's my cousin Antonietta. Hey! Hi, Carla! Hi! Hey, who's that guy with the Turkish mustache? The Saracen? Hey, Saracen! My cousins and nephews. Hey! Pleased to meet you. Be careful that kids don't drink wine. - Don't worry. The salad is coming now. Mr Luigi, you're so young to be a director. How old are you? 24 but I'm really 12. Well, 5 more than Carla. Just like me and my husband. Just 5 years. Do you have any brothers? - An only child, Ma'am. The sole heir. Where's your family? - In Carpi, in the province of Modena, Ma'am. No, my aunt isn't married. In Carpi, Miss. Your relatives must be happy that you direct. Not at all, Ma'am. Miss? - No, my aunt is married. Not at all, Ma'am. They're ashamed. They tell everyone that I'm an accountant. Do you see Sophia Loren when she comes on TV? I've never really seen Sophia Loren on TV. Sorry, don't feel bad, dear director. Nobody around here knows TV. That's because we don't have a TV! And why don't you buy one? Are you poor? In this house, TV will never set foot. Television is the death of conversation and family intimacy. Give me a break! What's mom doing in the kitchen? Let's help her, eh? No, for heaven's sake. When she's in there, she chases everybody away. You may be a great director, but I bet you can't tell me... HOW TO DRESS A SALAD! Yes, people, keep joking. But it's very important. Let's see how you do it. Well... Don't help. Don Raffaele, please forget it. But it doesn't seem that hard. First you put some oil... No, no. On a separate plate. The sauce is made on a separate plate, dear Mr Director. You don't throw on separately the oil and vinegar into the salad. A spoonful of vinegar, and 4 of oil, salt, sardines... Applaud! Even Mustafa. How Teresa used to like it. It's strange. One person is missing and the world feels empty. I had even lost the desire to cook. But things that are started must end well. All right? You are my Christmas tree, Lisa. It's foolish to feel responsible for what your children do. After all, everyone is born as they are. There's nothing you can do. But I can't sleep all the same. Who is that boy who's with you? You like him? This is the first time I've seen you in love, no? I really think so. I remember my youth as the most distressing period of my life. Young people don't know what they want, who they are. They stumble along. I began to understand something when I fell in love. Daddy? - No. But it doesn't matter. When I fell in love with dad, it was forever. I like him but that boy doesn't seem to have much in common with you. We really don't agree on anything or almost anything. And he's too young. That's a disease that'll pass quickly. You hafta wait. I am waiting. It seems like I could wait for him all my life. I don't know why. Because he is him and you are you. There is no other better reason. Carla! - Carla! Carla! Hey, Carla! Look there's a guy on the tree stealing your oranges! He's allowed! And come boating with us! What are you doing? - Come on! No, not today! I just got here! I'm busy! Tomorrow! You're prettier than me! Luigi says he'd like to flirt with you. But Don Raffaele didn't like the joke. Go on! Here I am! Take this. - Ah, thanks! Hi. - Hey! Hi! See you later, OK? - Don't go the wrong way, eh? Have a nice walk! Bye! Bye, Mama! We will! - Good morning, Ma'am! Hey, Carla! Have a nice walk and have fun! See you later! Bye, Carla! And have fun! - Bye! Bye! - Good day! Have fun! - See you soon, Carla! Goodbye, Carla! Bye! - See you later! Bye, Carletta! - Bye! Please, don't be late, OK? Bye! Have a nice walk, Carla! Bye! Were they too annoying? - No, they're adorable. I enjoyed it. You're so nice and kind to everyone. Even with Mustafa. Hey, where does that Don Raffaele come from? Who is he? Well, he's a friend of mom's. They love each other very much. What are we doing here? Let's go. - Yes. Excuse me, can you give us a lift? - Get out! Love, love, love... My love... - Bye! Wait. Wait. No. No, wait. Look at my little hand in yours. What's the matter? Nothing. Luigi. Stay here. Stay close to me. Sorry, but it's this hay. It takes my breath away. It gets me here. Are you ill? What a fool I was to throw away the inhaler. You said it was a hang-up but you see, I always need it. Just having it in my pocket... made me breathe easier. I feel like I'm suffocating. You want us to go back down? We'll go to the village. You can go to the pharmacy. Do you mind? Excuse me but it's not up to me. I know, I know. Let's go. Will you stop here? Weren't we supposed to go to the pharmacy? It's further down on the right. In the meantime, I'm going home. Do as you like. If you can't find it or if it's closed, you'll hafta go to Salerno. You think so? But I'll find it. I'll be right back. Do as you like. I do what I can. What the hell are you doing? You'll stop there, right? And turn around! Get out of the way! Vivarelli, do it yourself. - Yeah, yeah! Luigi! Giovanna! Jerk, what are you doing? Old fool! Wear your glasses! Didn't you see the stop sign? - I'll break your face! Write! Write! Bye! - Bye! Bye! See you soon! - Bye! Bye. Carla! Carla! Yes? It's ready! Tenna? It's Luigi. What are you doing? Me? Nothing. No, I was just thinking... if we could play some poker? Who opened? Hey, it's your turn. - Pass. Pass. - 20,000. I'll see you. - Not me. - No. A royal flush. - Dammit, 3 aces! You owe me 40,000, eh? - Fine, gimme 60 and that'll make 100. Will you write an IOU? Yeah, I'll do it. Who's that? Well, at least open it, no? I'm not here for anybody. I'm out of Rome for a consultation. Evening, is Achille here? - No, he's not. He's out of Rome for... - C'mon, I'm a friend! Teresa? You brought her here? Go to a hospital, an emergency room! Move! And get my name in the papers? And they'll ruin me because of some idiot bitch I met last night! How many did she take? - Few, one bottle. Here it is. Few? A bottle of 40 is few? She needs a stomach pump. Let's do it. You'll do it, OK? - How? With seltzer? Achille, you look to it, because I give up! Guys, come on, give me a hand. Easy though. Easy! Easy! Come on! Sorry, guys, but these things happen. Bernardi. - A pleasure. - Nice to meet you, Bernardi. "Today it's me, tomorrow it's you." Easy Over here. Through here. Careful. In the bathroom. - Pleased to meet you, Bernardi. Well? I'll open. Yeah. Not me. All right. Me too. Hey, if you're not playing, try to get her to walk She mustn't sleep. If she does, she's in big trouble. Make her walk. Keep her awake. Hey, you! Wake up! Come on! Wake up! Come on, beautiful! Wake up! Hey, this one is out. Let's not be silly, eh? How many cards? Give her a kick. See if she can feel it. 3. I said a kick! Go on! She felt that, eh? I bet you broke her leg! Hey, you, how many cards? - Hey, keep her awake. One, but I can't play like this. - Why? Because I can't. Come on, baby! Let's walk a bit. C'mon. - Come, this is a good hand. Whose turn is it? How many cards do you take? - 2. Well? - It's not my turn. Are we playing or what? What do you say? I say he's touching her tit. - Hey! What are you doing? I'm checking to see if she can feel. What? Jealous? - Go fuck yourself. C'mon, baby, let's go. - I pass. Let's end this. It's for the best. - And what are you doing? Hey, mustache, it's your turn. You gonna speak? - I pass. You? - Pass. Hey, they're passing here! C'mon, hurry up! - Coming! Damn, how much you weigh, my beauty. C'mon, be good. If I get a three-of-a-kind, I'll be right back, eh? No... Ah, Frida... Frida...! Oh, Frida... And who's this Frida now? Who the hell cares? Can anyone play like this? Let's see if we can have this hand in blessed peace, no? Hey! Well? Achille? - What do you want? Is the sofa yours or the landlord's? Yes, it's mine. Why? She's throwing up on it. Goddamn it the hell! She ruined my whole sofa! Vomit on the ground. Down there! That's enough! Let her be! Stop it! Yeah, stop it! I got it redone a month ago! - Knock it off! She's sick! Can't you see that? Leave her alone. Come on! I'm taking her to the clinic. Get up. C'mon, let's go. - What are you doing? Then you didn't understand a thing. You're not taking shit anywhere. Got it? Be calm. And all of you keep calm. You won't be mixed up in this. Rest easy. It all happened at my house. Look and see if he hurt me. Hello? Yes, right away. There's the switchboard that sends telegrams. Yes, hello? Miss? Sender: Luigi Vivarelli. Yes, Rai TV. It's going to Cetara, in the province of Salerno. Yes. Carla Lotito. No, the address is not needed. They're 4 houses. Well then... "Tuesday the 18th" "at 10 pm." "Watch the first channel on television." Stop. No, nothing. That's enough. Thanks. My heart burns like a candle when I hear your name, my beauty! Oh, be like the snow! The snow is cold but one can touch it. And you, how can you be... It must have been 9 or 10 when the hearing ended. The accused Pierluigi Canevari was acquitted. You know, Canevari went to jail... - Excuse me, Marchese? ...he took it as a personal affront. But the lawyer did his job well. As usual, after all. Many Perugina Kisses! ...that he bathed his horse! Poor King! - And also the poor horse! Yes, well! Oh, well! Yes, well! The Emperor carried away from him... Carla, what are you doing? Are you watching "Parade"? No, I'm waiting for something I'm interested in. Then I'm interested too. What is it? - I don't know. Please, I'd like to see it alone. Don't bug me! Go away! I get it: It's about that guy. OK. But let me say, you're quite the "tele-visionary", eh? Good evening. Airing in a few moments is a special report by Luigi Vivarelli on the theme: our neighbor. Our previous Milanese report on the theme of human solidarity caused quite a stir. We received hundreds of letters of horror and protest. So much so, we decided on a cross- check in a different environment. We leave it to you to judge the results of this new experience. Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Madonna! Let's go! - Yes, poor guy! Poor man, get up! What happened? - Let's call someone! Anyone! Pietro! Come up! Run! Run! Papa! - What's the matter? Come on down! Hurry! - One moment! Go on, drink! A little wine! Drink! Hey, what happened? Step aside! Come away! Away! Anto', they're getting me drunk! What does that one want? This guy's like a bull! The explanation became stormy. And there were some moments you could call "critical". But then we understood each other and made a friendly peace. There are many members here with us from the same family. Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters and grandchildren. Unfortunately, there were so many we weren't able to invite them all. But here with us is the trunk of this great tree with many branches. And he's the father of the father of this child's father. How old are you? - 97. And how many great-grandchildren? Your grandchildren's kids. How many? And now that you have come to this age with all these generations of children, what wish can you make to your children and to all of us? May they all become great-grandparents! Good evening. Ah, good evening. Miss Carla is not here. No, wait! Excuse me! Who is it? Ah, Luigi! Good evening, Ma'am. Hi. I was looking for Carla. Is she really not here? No, she's at a friend's house. And then we don't have TV. Yeah, right. But you should go too. They're all young people. It's right after the archway. A white house. Though they're all white here. - I'll take him there, Aunt. Good but come back right away. - Yes! Thank you, Ma'am! - Bye! And goodbye. - Bye, Luigi. Come on! She's not there. They say she left without even saying goodbye. Maybe she went home. - No. We would've met her on the way. Where the heck would she go at this time? If she wants to be alone, she has her place. Where is it? - There. She goes down there. Look. You pass through there, turning around the tips of the rocks. Shall I take you there? - No, thanks. I'll go by myself. Thanks. Bye! Bye! - Antonietta! And who was that? - You wouldn't care! We wouldn't care? Why not? The guy with the mustache! - Like the Turks! The "tele-visionary"! It's him, the Saracen! You wouldn't care! - What are you saying, squirt? Are you dumb? - Where did he go? He takes our women and we don't care? He made her cry! - He broke her heart! The Turk wants to kidnap her! The Turk wants to kidnap her! Carla, resist! Hey! Did you see it? Yes. Are you OK with it? Yes. Thank God. Carla, we're coming! - What's that? - Come on. Who are they? - Friends. Run! What do they want? - Nothing. They're joking. Run! Come on, hurry up! Carla! - The Saracen! Carla! - Handsome boy! The Saracen! - Carla! Carla! - Carla! Low window of cruel mistress, how many sighs I made for you! My heart burns like a candle when I hear your name, my beauty! Oh, be like the snow! The snow is cold but one can touch it. I really want to become a great grandmother. ...can you be so stern and cruel? Seeing me dying, don't you want to help me?
