I don't really know if I could pinpoint, you know, how exactly the idea came about. I think that there was one day, you know, and admittedly, this is one of my more depressing days. But I was thinking about the idea about how a cat has nine lives. And not in a good way, but more in, like, thought. A cat has to live nine lives! Like, are you fucking kidding me? I mean, I-- I barely have the wherewithal to live one. I sat with this some more, and... I thought about how I could create a little show around it. What eventually came up was, you know, there is a cat um, who can't think of a single reason to live one life, who is forced to evaluate every other cat's wonderful plans for how they wish to utilize, like, their... blessing. Yeah, yeah. Because that's how society sees it. Yeah, exactly. You know, in their society, you know, which is not much different than ours, to be honest. But, you know, the majority population, like, has this concept of a god who has, you know, bestowed upon them, you know, this gift of nine lives for a reason compared to, you know, all the other inferior creatures. So it's-- it's basically the same existential shit that we go through, just like... ...nine times it. This guy gets it. We'll be right back to talk with this genius right here after a break. From Little Kitty kitty litter. If you have a little kitty and he's a bit of a shitter, use the Little Kitty litter. Able to breathe a little bit? I'm glad you texted, by the way. Yeah, of course. I thought we were quickly becoming the happy-birthday text friends. Um, so do I need to worry about anyone coming up to us? Oh, God, no. I'm a writer. If anyone outside that small legion knows my face, then run, they're probably a psychopath. Fair enough. So, to what do I owe this pleasure? What could possibly bring you out to this godforsaken city? A godforsaken bachelorette party? Oh, fuck. -Yeah. -Sounds fun. You mispronounce miserable. That bad, huh? It's just like some fucking stupid live for the weekend mentality. It's dumb. I-- I guess I just hang on to the whole romanticism of marriage. And so the idea of giving someone a bachelorette party is, you know, their little rite of passage for their last bit of fun forever. It's a nice exchange for spending a lifetime not having to be alone. There's something different about you, and I'm just wondering if it's what I think it is. Nose job. Botox, breast implants. You're not a virgin anymore. Fuck you. You're fucking not. -You better give me details. -No details. What? A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell? More like a gentleman hasn't. -Oh. -Yep. Sorry. Usually just bring it up right away. No, that's fine. I told myself I wouldn't bring it up because, you know, I didn't want to be a downer. You're not a downer. This is it. Fuck off. Ta-da! You, uh... You want a coffee? Hmm. Cool. All right. Yes, yes, yes. You're in for a treat, by the way. - I could use a jolt. - No, no, no... This is so much more than a jolt. I... I get to brag a little bit. I got a new Chemex and burr grinder and I got Stumptown beans. ♪ God, I forgot how pretentious you are ♪ -Pretentious? -My burr grinder. And Stumpville coffee. Okay, first of all, it's Stumptown. -Yeah, whatever. -And second of all, I-- There's nothing wrong with having taste. This tastes like fruit taking a shit in coffee. That's what coffee is supposed to taste like. -No! -Oh, my God. You need to get out more. Mature your palate. So, how are you? -I'm good. -Oh, God. -Is that how we're gonna do it? -All right, all right. I don't know what you want me to say. Well, don't answer me like you're a fucking bank teller. Like, "How are you?" "Good. How are you? How's your day?" I honestly think it's a pointless question. Like it's fucked if you do, fucked if you don't. You know, either I say I'm good, you know, and we carry on with a nice little break from the world. Or I tell you how I really feel, and then the mood turns into a bummer. Oh, my God, it's not a bummer if I'm the person and I'm asking you. Yeah, but that's the thing. Hey, everyone says they want to know, but then as soon as you tell them, they're like... ...because who wants to spend time working through someone else's problems? Okay, I feel like it depends on the person, though. For certain superficial relationships, hell yeah, 100%. I don't actually want to know how you're doing, but if it's someone you're close to, isn't that kind of point? -Maybe I'm wrong. -No, you're not wrong. I just-- -I got to take it. -I mean-- Hello? Yeah, no, no. I can talk right now. All right? Hold on a second. -Let's get you a beer. -Yeah. Hold on. Let me get-- Sorry. Let me just get to my desk real quick. Okay and-- Uh, yeah, so not you-- All right, I'm ready. Um, so, uh, I like the esthetic of the heavier set one, so, ballpark, or something. I was thinking was like, Well, I mean, do you not believes the father's blessings? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit too creepy Russian. Uh-- but I mean-- You know, somewhere in that range? I-- I got company here though, so I'll-- We'll talk about this later. All right. Talk to you. Bye. Wow! I knew I should've made you wait outside. Oh, that's fine. No, it's good. You're just... ...going to ze hell. -Is he based on your priest? -Ooh. Um-- Okay. Fun little Dylan update. I love Dylan updates. I'm not Catholic anymore. You're not Catholic? I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time believing this because last time I was in town, you made me go to mass with you. You had fun. You got baked in my car before we went in. Couldn't have done it without it. Honestly, it made watching you fascinating. How long has it been? I don't know. A couple of years. How? How? -How? -Yeah, how? I-- I just stopped believing. Oh, so you're an atheist? No, no, no. I believe in God. Um, I just don't think of him as the Almighty, or, you know, the father. I don't even know if I think of him as a Him or a being at all. Maybe just, uh, an energy. Oh, so you've traded in Catholicism for New-Agey bullshit? Okay. I haven't traded in anything for anything. And don't hit me with that Mercury retrograde bullshit. Sort of hoped it would have been the serial pedophilia that would have done it, though. Yeah. So fucked up. And believe me, I know how awful this sounds, um, but I was kind of jealous. What? Yeah, I mean, look, I was an altar boy for six years. I mean, why not me? You know what was wrong with me? -Oh, you're sick. -No, no. Okay, hear me out. Okay? If it was inevitable that I was going to be molested, why couldn't it be at the hands of a priest so I could at least sue the Catholic Church instead of my poor white trash cousin? I mean, yeah, when you put it that way, what the fuck? - Right? - Yeah. I mean, all I have to show for eight years of being molested is the memories. Hey, you can blow through settlement money fast, but memories? Tell me about it. Please tell me you don't still talk to him. Who? Eric? No, but I don't really talk to any of family anymore. But you would still talk to him? Yeah. I don't know. It's that-- Can I ask you a personal question? - Depends. - You don't have to answer. Just ask the fucking question. What did he... Do? Never mind. That's weird to wonder. -It's-- Nah. -No, no, no, it's fine. It's not weird to wonder. Um-- Everything was limited to... oral. The first time he did it it was on my second birthday. -Fuck, you remember that? -Earliest recorded memory. Jesus Christ. It might be the oldest recorded memory of a blowjob. Definitely the earliest recorded memory of a birthday blowjob. Hey, tell you what. Let's talk about something else. Yeah, fair enough. -How about that beer I teased? -Yeah, where is my beer?

Have you ever done something intending to help people only to run as fast as you can in the opposite direction to save yourself? No, that's only because I've given up trying to help people. Ha-ha. Man, I was really passionate when I started out. I remember. I should have joined the Peace Corps. Gotten it out of my system. Then what happened? It's complicated. -Okay... -I don't know, I-- I felt like when I got into it, I was so full of idealism and this nonsense about what I was going to do and who I was going to be, and, you know, you think the world is getting more progressive and it is. But even at a liberal ass outlet, I was still facing the same problems I would anywhere else. -Explain. -Okay, here's a good example. So one of the older women who worked there came up to me after the first few weeks and asked me how everything was going, right. And so I'm thinking, Oh, this lady is so sweet and yada, yada, yada. You know what she says to me? She says that I use too many periods in my email and that a lot of people don't like that because it comes off as a little abrupt and unapproachable and in less euphemistic terms, a bitch. I'm serious. So I'm sitting there thinking, "This is fucking ridiculous." And then she leaves. But I honestly found myself starting to put exclamation points in emails wherever I could. And then when I started realizing that I was doing that, I thought, "Fuck this." If I wasn't a woman, this wouldn't be the case. I would just be seen as decisive and assertive. -Says the bitch. -Fuck you, I'm serious, I know, I'm sorry, but it's fucked up. And that's not even the tip of it. I mean-- I think they mean well, and I know there are better outlets out there because I have friends who work at them, but at the end of the day, it's still an old, white dude who's the publisher. Still an old, white dude who's the editor and then you start getting some trickle-down diversity to fill some quotas or some bullshit. Damn. Tell me how you really feel. Uh-huh.

I give amazing head. - Yes, I like it. - You're a biter Whoa. I have never had one complaint. Actually, I have had a standing ovation. A standing ovation doesn't count if you're giving it to yourself. - All of you fuck off. - You know why -he doesn't do it? -You got chronic dry mouth. Look, his is fucking huge.

Of course, nowadays everyone's just on their fucking phones, so it's pretty hard. It's probably jarring looking down and not seeing it glowing back up at you. "Tsundoku." The habit of buying books, never reading. To my nerdy friend. To my cruel and unusual friend. Ah. To friends. To us! -Batman. -To meat Batman. Do I get to hear the spontaneous brilliance? Um, it's actually an idea I've been working on for a while now, and you reminded me of it earlier. And so, you know, I guess I'm just sort of caught up in that. What's the idea, Dyl? It's called SAM. It's an acronym for Socks Against Monogamy. -Fuck, yeah, I'm hooked. -Thanks. Oh, my God. Dylan, elaborate. Okay. You want me to give you the pitch? Pitch me. I want the full pitch. Okay. So, you know how socks are hell-bent on getting lost. You know, like, it's only a matter of time before they inevitably get stuck in the dryer, and, you know, you're stuck with a bunch of different single socks? - Oh, that struggle, honestly. - Okay. So, my take is an approach to their world where that's, like, their rite of passage. They're born the opposite of us, you know, together from birth. You know, and their whole adolescence is built upon this pretense of separating when they come of age. So, like, it's sort of the group they graduate to. It's SAM, you know. But in my story, there is a pair of socks that don't want to separate. You know, they love each other and they don't understand why there's this emphasis on needing to go through life alone when you can spend it with another person or a sock. Sorry. And so when it's their time to ceremonially part in the dryer... ...they decide to say, "Fuck it," and they stay together. Oh, I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Good. How do they fuck? -They-- They don't-- -Ah. That's sort of the beauty of it. You know, they, uh, there's nothing physical. It's just... companionship. Or maybe these are just a few of the reasons why I'm still a virgin.

It's embarrassing. It's not even that big of a deal, Dyl. Everyone says that, but I think they take it for granted. Like, how obsessed they were about losing their virginity when they were in high school. Have you ever thought about getting a prostitute? Thought about it. A lot. -And? -I'm afraid it would make me depressed if I lost it that way. -It's not precious, Dyl. -Oh, I know, it's a burden. I actually-- Here, sit down for this one. Oh, what? I, uh-- I actually did go to a special kind of establishment once. Oh. A story with a happy ending, so to speak. Oh! The old rub and tug. Do tell. Okay. So, my buddy told me about this place. There's this joint, this rundown office building. So obviously, I made an appointment as soon as I got home. So I get there. And this super cute Vietnamese girl, she escorts me in and tells me to get ready and... Oh... -Well? -It was great. -But-- -But? I went back a week later, all right? Same place, different girl, still Vietnamese, still cute, but not happy. In fact, she was fucking miserable, you know? She left the door open a crack while I was getting undressed and I could see her sucking down a cigarette with her hand trembling, you know, and she came back in, the energy was night and day different from the first girl, The first girl was talking the whole time. What the fuck was she even saying? "You're so big. You're so hard." Okay. None of that from this one? Nothing. In fact, not only was she silent, but she looked off to the side of me while she jerked me off. So I'm obviously in my head at this point, like, you know, thinking that I did something wrong, you know, it's something with me, you know? But then on my drive home, it hit me, like, these girls were probably sex slaves. I mean, I was sure of it-- I didn't know, but I was sure of it. I felt disgusted-- Did you report them? I stopped at a payphone. Where the fuck is there still a payphone, dude? 7-Eleven on La Cienega. At least it was there then. I even used the made-up voice and everything. You following me? I actually had a friend who worked in a parlor of ill repute. Actually, no fuck ill repute. I hold what she does in very high regard. She is a dakini. Tantric massage? -Sting? -Yeah. So my roommate, Sting, from college was a dakini. And anyway, I had all these questions for her, so finally she told me to just come in and see for myself. I mean, not with her, with another girl. Dude, this is just what you need. -Yeah? -Yeah, it's wild. There's this interesting dichotomy at play because on one hand, it's extremely sexy and sensual. And then on this whole other level, it's this deep, deep spiritual awakening. I'm not overstating anything when I say that I walked out of that room a different person. How? I mean you had me at sexy, sensual, spiritual awakening. Okay, so you get there. And she greets you at the door, and it's like she's an old friend. And she just stares at you and embraces you, not sexually, but just human touch. I mean, that's the beauty of the whole thing, really. It's all about human touch. Anyway, she-- she brought me in and she sat me on the sofa and she just kind of held me. Again, a very nurturing way, you know, asking me what my loves are, how my day was, what I did. And then she told me to get in the shower, which is like a spa setup, so fucking nice. Anyway, I got in the shower, I had the shower and I come out in a bathrobe, and she's standing there, naked, stunning. And she tells me to go sit on the massage table cross-legged. And then she comes and she sits across from me... and she just looks at me with the most serene smile. And she tells me to match my breathing to hers, you know? She gets her hand and she places it on my heart. And then she gets mine and she places it on hers. And we were just sitting there, just staring at each other. And I can't guess how long we were sitting there for because... it just felt like the most blissful eternity. Just staring at each other, our eyes... penetrating into the depths of the other, of the universe. All our breath felt like the tide crashing over us. Wow. Yeah. Tantric massage. Find a place. It'll change your life. I don't know, Zoe. Do you remember me telling you about being raped in college? Gosh. I completely forgot. It's fine, whatever, I mean-- I only bring it up because I know that that stuff could really just throw your life off track, you know? I mean, we're all snowflakes in our victimhood or whatever but it can really just screw you up, so-- You never told me if you knew the guy. Guys, plural. Yeah, I know them. There were two of them? Jesus Christ. Yeah, I mean, doesn't change anything. The thing that makes me laugh in a sadistic kind of way is that I actually liked them both. You were friends? No, not as friends. I mean, I only just met them, but, uh, they were cute. Probably would've fucked either of them if they hadn't decided to rape me first, you know? God, Zoe. I-- Ah, what are you gonna do? What? I forgot a buddy of mine's show. It's going on tonight. What kind of show? He's this musician. His name's Naiqui. Like, this whole funk, soul, whatever. Is he good? Yeah, he's incredible. It's just there's, like, a crapload of people there and it-- We're good. We don't have to go. You're here. It gives me a perfect excuse. We're good. Let's go. No, I'm saying we don't have to. No, but I'm saying I wanna. -No, but-- -Naiqui? Oh! Oh, my God. Naiqui? I love Naiqui. He's my favorite. Oh, Naiqui! Naiqui is playing? In this town tonight? I forgot I have tickets! Come on.

I know my boy looked good in pigtails and a little schoolgirl skirt. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Red leather Britney. Get the fuck outta here. - Wait, wait, I have-- - Red leather? Wait, I have the photo. -I have the photo. -You're just hellbent on embarrassing me tonight, aren't you? Yeah, why not? Not a department you need help in. Can't find it. Come on, Dyl. See, this is why I didn't want to do it. You were fine. - Hey. - My brother. Man, good job in that, bro. -Oh, thank you. -I'm gonna get out of here. -Oh, you outta here? -Yeah, man, gotta get going. Oh, you know what? Let's all take a picture for the gram real quick. All four of us. Come on. -I look gross. I look gross. -Nah. What, you can't be seen with two brothers in public? Oh, I'm brown too. Oh... so we are on different shades now. I know how you light-skinned folks see us. - Okay, for the record-- - No! You don't get to talk. Listen, these white people on that new drug. -Imma get out of here, bro. -My man. -Good show, man. -Thank you, brother. Yes sir. This is so good, man. It's so good you guys kept in contact all those years. That's it? Thank you, bye. Oh, hey. -Tsundoku. -Hmm. Do you want something to drink? Uh, no. I actually have to get up early, so I'm just going to order an Uber. Look-- I want to apologize. I know I've been MIA for a while now, and I feel bad. That's okay. That's okay? What? Nothing. I mean-- It's just-- I-- I don't mean to be an asshole, but does the phone not work both ways? I don't get it. Did you just say sorry so that you would hear me say sorry? No, that's not why I said sorry. So then it's all on me? No, it's not-- It's just-- I tried. Okay? I call. You never called back or even texted. Okay, so, like, did you try or were you MIA, Dyl? Which one was it? Or were you saying you were MIA because you were commenting on the fact that I was MIA, and you're doing your Dylan passive-aggressive bullshit? Are you shutting off now? We're not having this talk? Okay, cool. Great, cool. Then I am the dick. Cool. Awesome. Great. I just want to let you know that the only reason we're together is because I reached out. Oh... Thank you. You're welcome. This is ridiculous. -No, shit. -Well, I'm sorry. Why are we fighting right now? Why are we fighting, were we having a good time? Yeah, we were, but that's the problem. You know, if we enjoy each other so much, why did we stop talking? -I-- I don't know. -You wanna know my theory? Sure. Hmm. I think you got tired of me. I think you started to look at me as sort of a burden to hang out with, because I always went to you with my problems. And so when I picked up on that, I stopped going to you with my problems. And when that happened, I don't think you knew what to do anymore, because I think you liked it. -You think I liked it? -Yep. Unbelievable. Oh, my God. - Fuck you. - Wow! Fuck you. You know what? You want to have a whole pity party about this because you're such a downer when the reality is, that's not even a fucking issue. Then for Christ's sake, Zoey, what is it? It's the fact that-- that you won't indulge in anyone else's problems but your own. Oh. Yeah, that's good. Typical Zoey. Grab your stuff. Walk away. I'll talk to you in another couple of years. Oh, yeah? Cool. I'll give you your birthday text, dude. Don't bother using exclamation points because we both know it's not the punctuation that makes you a bitch. Hey, do you remember me telling you being-- Fuck. I know you care, Dylan. You're the kindest person I've ever met, but... Fuck, if you aren't a selfish asshole sometimes. You think I got tired of you? I love you. You're my favorite fucking person in the world. I miss you. I'm sorry. -You don't have to do that. -Zoey. I'm sorry. I guess I just got scared. I didn't want to keep spending the rest of the night pretending everything's good and we're happy when... I don't know if come tomorrow, everything's just going to go back to how it was. I get it. You're not a bitch. But you do use too many periods. You are passive-aggressive... ...but like everyone's passive-aggressive, so... What would you say... to a little... peace joint? I'mma bash you over the head with that fucking thing. See, this is why you're still single. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God. It's so cold. -Well? -I didn't even know you still played that thing. Play is a strong word, but yeah, I fuck around. Does fucking around mean you have a song? Oh. You do have a song. -No, no, no, no, no. -Oh, my God. I knew it. It's stupid. Doesn't even make sense. Fuck that. I want to hear it. Yeah, the lyrics are, like, weird. Oh, my God. Zoey? I love Zoey. She's the best. Touché? -Just play it. -I can't. Okay.

Yeah, but like, that's not even the top three, I don't think. What is it about anal that does it for people anyway? And this is asking as a completely ignorant virgin. I mean-- -Have you done it? -Yeah, I've done it. - Why? - No. I don't know. It feels good. To get your ass torn open? Doesn't it hurt? Okay. First of all, this isn't Alien. And it's a good pain. Can you even cum that way? I mean, it's hard, but the point of sex isn't necessarily to cum. I mean, it's wonderful if you do, but that's not what it's all about. I don't think. Anyways, yes, I have cum from anal. I don't do it all the time. Maybe once in a while, but... it's such a hassle though. Ugh. I mean if you want to do it right, and not get mess anywhere. Mess? Take a wild guess. Okay. Calm down, virgin. There are going to be some weird shit sometimes. Sometimes, literally. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. You're going to love it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So one of the first times I tried it, um, I, uh-- I didn't understand the importance of the whole prep process. -There's a prep process? -Of course. There's a prep process. What-- What would you even do? I don't know. You, like, do shit or whatever you like. You go to the pharmacy, you get an enema, you stick it up your butt, you make sure you have a lot of fibres, so you're regular, hydrated, and whatever. Yeah, there's a prep process. Anyways, idiots like me have to learn that the hard way. I did it with my boyfriend at the time. Nice guy. Scared of even trying it, -but curious -Of course. I mean, I was too. I hadn't ever tried it before. Anyways. So we go to the shower because we think that's the smartest thing to do in case anything goes wrong. And thank God, we did, because we were 100% right. Anyways, so he puts it in and we start slowly because side note, anal will make any guy's dick feel at least 73% bigger. -Noted. -So he's... fucking me in the ass. He's got this smile plastered on his face. God bless him And I'm enjoying it more than I had anticipated. But I'm also feeling this weird sensation or whatever. And being the nice guy that he was, when he noticed this, he did the nice thing and... ...pulled out. Which is when I... shit everywhere. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know. And I will never forget the shriek that he let out like-- And all the while, I'm still releasing mind you and I'm profusely apologizing and I'm maneuvering my body, so at least I'm missing his legs. No, I can't. That's-- -That's fucking wild. -Oh, my God. I mean, weren't you embarrassed? Of course. Are you kidding me? I was mortified. I was traumatized. I never wanted to do it again. -And we didn't. -Obviously. You see, that's the thing. Not obviously. I firmly believe that the person you're meant to be with is the one that you can literally shit on and they still love you. Which is like weird, and fucked-up or whatever, but that's the comfort. At least for me, that I feel is necessary to have a successful relationship, especially when it comes to sex. I mean, sex is like the messiest thing you'll ever do. It can smell, people have disturbing faces, like you can fart, you can queef, whatever, I mean, but at the end of it, that person still loves you even if you don't make them cum. I mean, if you make them cum consistently, they'll probably love you forever, but... I think that just comes along with being vulnerable and comfortable with that person in that relationship. That's when you get to ride that sweet spot... of fucking sometimes and making love most times. Here I was just hoping for missionary. Oh, come on. Beggars can't be choosers. Okay. You're telling me that when you're sitting at home alone with a bottle of lube, watching porn, that you're clicking on the search bar and you're typing in "vanilla"? First of all, I rarely let my lube watch porn. Yeah, whatever. You know what I mean? -What do you watch? -Uh... Oh, come on. I just showed you mine. You're not going to show me yours? What is it? -I don't know-- -Bondage. - Hentai. Gay porn. -I-- -What? I think it's funny how, you know, girls can talk about how they watch lesbian porn, and it's not a big deal, you know? It's like, "Oh, yeah, that makes sense. You know, that's hot." But when a guy talks about watching other guys, and it's like, "Hmm. Wait a minute. Are you sure you're not gay?" I think that's how some people see. - But not all people. - But... -A majority. -Okay, yeah. But see that's the problem. We all play this game of hush-hush and pretend when it comes to sex and porn and that just makes everyone feel guilty when they go home and they watch it in private, which is bullshit. I mean-- I guarantee you-- I guarantee you that if some hacker group came out and released everyone's search history, made it public information, the world will be a much happier place. And I don't disagree. Which is why I'm telling you I'm not judging you. So feel free to personally unload your burden. It's not like it's some big deal. Okay? It's not some crazy burden like you're making it out to be. Do you watch gay porn? -I-- -Okay, so you watch gay porn. Okay. Okay. Yes. I have watched gay porn before. And admittedly... I still watch it from time to time. Okay? Not a significant percentage, but... I still watch it all the same. -Are you gay? -No! See, that's what I'm talking about. I'm proving your point, idiot. I'm saying that you get to decide what you are because ultimately you're the only one who knows who you want to be with. Yeah, but it's not that simple. I mean, Jesus. Like, my first, my only sexual experiences are with a guy. You know, part of me can't help but see men sexually. And I don't know, I don't-- I don't mean to get all nature versus nurture. No, I get it. Sometimes I wish I was gay. Meaning, if I was... that would explain so much. You know, it would mean that I'm not scared or embarrassed. I'm just gay. You know, I'm not into women. But I am. -Into women? -Yes. Obsessively. Like, exclusively. Except for those few revved-up moments. And, you know, I'm always dreaming up some fucking fairy tale for me and every pretty woman I see, you know? But then there are those other moments and I get all confused and fucked up. Okay, well, that's why I'm sitting here. And I'm telling you that you're totally normal, Dylan. I love you and I accept you. All of you. You know what is fucked up? Even if I was gay... I would have to deal with not only the prejudices that already exist, but also my own psyche. You know, wondering if I'm only gay because I was molested. I mean-- Fuck. Hey. Did you ever see that documentary a couple of years back? The Act of Killing, you know, about those dogs from the Indonesian genocides, recreating their atrocities? Oh yeah, that was insane. Hard to watch. You know, in the end, when... the main guy is watching the film and he expresses maybe not regret, but... at least some sense of understanding of the pain he inflicted. I-- I felt some strange sense of hope. Like, you know, if a monster like that can acknowledge, even in some small way that why he did hurt people, then maybe there's some hope for humanity. You know, like, if people can learn, then, you know, they can change. Then I start thinking of the millions of victims, you know, the dead, the murdered. Like, what are they supposed to learn? How do they change? You know? You know, when you die or your parents die, like, how do you change, you know? Or when you're raped or molested, how do you move on? I mean, people do, so I'm told. I mean, I'd love to know how because I still can't figure it out. I mean, you know... All I can see is my piece of shit cousin is married with kids, living his fucking life, and-- and-- and that's fine. You know, I don't-- I-- I'm serious. I don't begrudge him his life. I just-- I hope he feels such crippling, fucking guilt. I hope every day is a brutal struggle with shame and fear and regret. And I hope-- I hope he suffers every day of his miserable fucking life like I do. If I could move on, then by all means, I wish him the same. But until then... Fuck him. He's moved on. He probably has. Of course, he has. You should too. I had a friend... Tell me once... She said... "You know who has victimized you the most in your life? You." She said, "Your cousin stopped molesting you when you were ten and... you've picked up the baton ever since." And... it knocked me out. I knew she was right, but fuck, if it didn't hurt, you know, like, realizing that all that misery, all those years of pain, I did it to myself, you know? And if I want it to stop, you know, I have to be the one that stops it. Like, I have to-- I have to be the one. And I can't. I-- I can't. I want to so badly, but I just-- -Why not? -I don't know. -Yes, you do. -I can't. I-- - Come on. Take control. - I-- I just-- You are in control. Okay? You know that, right? You are the one who gets to decide how you want to live your life. What is it going to take? What does it change? I-- I've thought this over so many fucking times. If-- If I could just get rid of this fucking... You know, if I could just get rid of this-- this fucking, you know, and move on, you know, and be normal, you know? And for the first time in my life, not hate myself for not being normal. I could let it go. I think I could, you know? But-- And I know. I know, I know. I need to just stop skirting around the edges with these massages and just get a prostitute and just get it over with. -Do you want to take care of it? -Yeah, I do. -I really fucking do. -Yeah? Yeah, I-- I'm so sick of this. Then let's. Let's? Take care of it. -Are you saying... -Yeah. Are you serious? Do you want to go back to your place? Oh, I am so embarrassed. Hey, hey. No more embarrassment, okay? Okay. Oh, you don't have to do that if you don't want. I want to. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, okay. Okay. -Zoey? -I can't, I can't, I can't... Okay. It's okay. -Zoey, are you okay? -Yeah. -Are you okay? -Okay. -Okay. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -No, no... I just-- -No, no, no, it was too much. -I understand. -No, no, no, no. It's-- - It's not that. - It's um... It's-- It's complicated. It's just complicated. Fuck. You can talk to me. Okay. Uh, so... about a year ago, I was working the night shift at this bar on Colfax because... ...entry-level journalist salaries don't exactly pay the rent in Denver, you know? I noticed this guy in the coal section one night... and he kept coming in more and more. And I was aware of him because he was cute... and he would stare at me. I thought it was really sexy. One night for the first time, he sat in my section. And again he didn't say anything. He would just-- He just stared at me. And I thought that was weird. I told him, I'd give him some time and I walked down the staff hallway to my locker. I still remember the pain of my knees bearing down on the cracked tiles of the bathroom floor. I could feel everything and I can feel it. I can feel it now. It's this-- It's like this phantom pain, you know, that comes in waves. And I remember everything. You know, like, he... He had his hand over my head. And I was struggling to move it away, not because I believed I could actually do anything about it, but because he had my head right next to the toilet plunger. And I felt really nauseous and I didn't know if I was feeling nauseous because of what was happening or because of the fucking plunger. And I wanted to scream, but I couldn't really scream because my voice just disappeared into nothing. I tried not to feel anything, but that didn't work. I just really wanted to go numb. I can just switch off. But my knees hurt really bad, so I focused on my pain. Focussed on my pain from my knees, like a mantra, you know? Like, you just-- Like you use your pain to mask your pain. Zoey, I... Fuck. I am so sorry. No. No, no, no. Hey, hey. Don't be. I am sorry. That's why I quit my job. That's why I stopped seeing you. That's why I stopped seeing everyone. I just retreated. The worst part is-- I mean, there's a lot of worse parts, but... ...it's thinking of college. What happened in college. I used to never really think about it or I compartmentalized it enough to just, like, live my life and get along with it. But now I think about it all the time. Now it's just running through my mind all the time, every day. Like, they're just, like, little details of that night that just go through my mind or, like, smells and stuff, like, I can't walk down the street and smell a guy's cologne without feeling sick. I'll run through that night, I was flirting with them, which is fucking normal, you know? You're flirting with people and then I decided to make out with one of them and the other one was just, like, hovering, and I thought that he would just take the hint and... just go away, but he-- Because I'd already made my decision, but... I didn't know that they already decided what was going to happen. Then I see myself giving in because, maybe, it doesn't have to be that if I give in, if I let it happen, it doesn't have to be that. -Did I let it happen? -No, you didn't. I don't know, man. -Did I let it happen? -You didn't let it happen. Shit. Dyl, if I can't outrun that, what the fuck am I going to do with this one? Zoey, I-- I don't even know where to begin. It's fine. Bah! I'm sorry I loaded on you. Are you kidding? Thank you. Zoe... It's okay. I'm sorry I broke down tonight. If-- You know, if you felt like you had to do this all for me. If I brought all this up-- No, you didn't bring up anything that wasn't already at the surface. Dyl, I have to break through this. I need to... I... I need you. I need someone I can trust... because I'm terrified of everyone else right now. I can't go on feeling like this. Hmm? I know you understand that. I do. So, we're good. So, if I just cry or freak out or whatever, I'll start crying too. What? -What? -Sit with me.
