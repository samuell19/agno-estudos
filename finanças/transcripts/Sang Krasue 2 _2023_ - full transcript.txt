What's this boat doing here? I have a bad feeling about this. Oh damn! Rue! Rue! Shit! Listen, I'll go get the white doctor. You two wait here. Hurry up! 20 YEARS LATER What are you doing, love? Reading my new book, almost done. Is it fun? Time for your medicine. Good girl. Now let me help you pack. We're going to go see Father Augustine. - Okay. - Okay? What is it, dad? Nothing. It's so cute. Sao…. Go wait outside. Don’t wander off. Her condition… is still like before she began with the medicine. But what's unusual is… now she can keep it under control. She resumes her normal shape before her head starts to… Are you certain she never skipped the medicine? Not even once, Father. And does your chest still hurt? No. Not since Sao was born. Sao is the love born from you and Darin. You cannot fix the past. Best to focus on improving her condition now. Sao's saliva can still spread the disease. Someone may get infected. The medicine we extracted from herbal leaves and roots is too weak to cure her now. This means… I need to add another ingredient. Let's hope it'll work. What are you reading? A male firefly flashes its light in a specific pattern to attract a female. If the female likes it, she'll respond by flashing her light in the same pattern. Then they'll fly towards each other and mate. After the female lays eggs, she'll die. If they don't fall in love, neither of them has to die, you think? Sao! Sao! Are you in here? We'll get cramps if we hide in there any longer. But… why do you have to hide? I have to go now. Hi, Mr. Firefly. My name is Cloud. What? Klao? Cloud. Klao? Cloud in English means the floating white thing in the sky. But you can call me Klao if you want. Everybody does. Cloud… Strange name. Anyway, my name is Sao. What is it that you are playing? This? Mouth organ. No idea how to play it. But its sound is beautiful. Besides drawing, what else can you do? Don't you have any friends? We can be friends. We can play together. Have you got everything you need? Just a couple more documents and I'm all set. You'll need some time to get the hang of the language. But you'll be fine. Study hard and come back to help me here. Have you told Cloud yet? It's so hot, why are you wearing long sleeves? My skin gets burned in the sun. Done. Took forever and it doesn't even look like me. My face is lopsided and my eyes are crooked. Go, go, there it is! Get lost, whitey! Or we'll beat you up again. Why did you hurt it? Listen, it's just an animal. We are humans. We can do what we want with it. Give it to me. Don't do it, Klao. Whoa, she wants to play too. This is a boys' game. Stay out of it, girl! Hey, leave her alone. Fine. Let's beat him up. Get him. She's a ghost! Sao! Sao! Sao! Sao! You have to fight them back. Don't be such a weakling. I can't look after you forever. Are you leaving soon? Yes, soon. Who will treat your wound when I'm gone? It's nothing. Here's another one. The wings are snapped, it won't make it. When it dies, bury it behind the chapel. What are you doing? Klao. Klao. What did you do? I don't know. I just wanted it to get better and… What are you doing? Do it again. Who else knows of this? Father? No, he doesn't know. Don't do it again. And don't ever tell anyone. Got it? A new medicine from Father Augustine. Take it, sweetie. There's no need. It won't come out. What? What did you say? Nothing. It's yours. And this is for you. No, you keep it. It's a gift from me. Why don't you try it? Too difficult. Don't let my dad see it. Why? I don't know… Maybe he's afraid someone will get my disease. The disease… that turned you the other day? Aren't you scared of me? No. I'm not. I have something inside me. How can you do it? It's weird. I don't know. But yeah, it's weird. So how do you play it? Just blow into it. Freaks stick together, right? Goodbye, Father. Okay. God bless you. Sao. 12 YEARS LATER You're so lucky. You can go anywhere you want. Sao. Sao. It's here again. It comes and goes. I'm not keeping it. You know why we can't keep it. I've told you, it won't come out. But that doesn't mean you are totally cured. Then… it means I have to live with it for the rest of my life. You've not been taking your meds? Pack your bag now. We have to go to Father Augustine. Rumors are going around about Krasue at Honey Swamp. A gut-sucking ghost. A she-demon with only head and entrails, hunting for prey at night, flashing a twinkling light as she moves. Just a scary kids' tale. To keep them in at night. That's all. I like fairy tales. And I've heard this one so many times. See those animals? Before they were found, they only existed in fairy tales. These photos are proof that something is waiting to be discovered. And if we discover it, if we are the first to catch it, our names will go down in history. And you know what? History always comes at a price. Pan is the only person who can catch this monster for me. Yes. What kind of job? Krasue? Yes. Got it. What are you boys doing? Homework? What are you doing? Let's play. Let it stay here. It's crying again! Krasue… It's getting more virulent. The disease has evolved to the point where our medicine can no longer contain it. I need to add more ingredients. But that will come with a side effect. Don't worry. Stay here, Sao will get better soon. Okay. The paint is still wet. Your skills have improved. So how's it going? How have you been? Guess I'm all right. And you? I'm good. Your eyes… their color has changed. Right? Yeah. It just happened. But your vision is still all right? Hey. You still have it. Good at playing it now? I'm better at painting. Father has asked me to come get Mr. Klao to dinner. Someone from England wishes to see him. Anan! What did Anan study in England? Medical Science. The university he went to is one of the best in this field. - So you'll become a doctor? - Oh. Not really. More like a medical researcher. And you're here for business? Yes, I came to deliver some herbs around here. Thought I should pay Father a visit. What is it like there? It's good. And it's cold. So… Will you go work in Bangkok or stick around to help Father? I guess he wants me here. So I'll stay for a while. Now let me ask you something. Can you still do it? Say you didn't tell anyone. Father? No, I didn't. I spent over 10 years there. I saw many things I never thought I'd ever see. But I still can't figure out how you did it. I'm sorry. It's fine. A tiger did it. Look at the tracks. But this one… It's not like the one I saw last week. That one died a freakish death. Freakish? The belly was ripped open. Something fed on its entrails. What's left was a bloody mess. Thanks for bringing me here. I hope this one will work. Thank you. Cloud will run an errand for me in town tomorrow. I've asked him to take Sao along. Do you think it'll be good for her? I'm not sure about that. With teenagers, you can't be too strict. Let them breathe. You'd been through that before, right? Yes. Did you forget we're going to town? No. Don't you think it's strange? All white animals are highly desirable. It's not the color that makes them special. But for now… wipe the color off your face first. Are we going or not? I wish I could spend every day of my life like today. So it's not working? This? Well, I would've been cured a long time ago. Sao. Let me try something. Klao, are you all right? Sao, you okay? Sao. What's wrong? It's late. Let's go home. Sao. We meet again, at last. How are you? Never been better. This is your first payment. Collect the rest after you've caught it. One more thing. I want it alive. Can you do that? Don't give me that righteous look. Their parents sold them to me. And otherwise they'd starve to death, anyway. Good for you still to have a job. Better hurry up and bring me that Krasue. Or it could be your son in there. Son of a bitch. Sao! Sao! I'm going to the market. Want to come? You two should stay. We can keep working on the formula. We'd better leave, Father. Sao is not safe here. Goodbye. Goodbye. Calm down, Sao. Sao, please. Sao. I've tweaked the formula. Have her try it. I don't think it's going to work. At least I'm here. Should anything happen, I can help you. All right. It's really nice here. You're so lucky to wake up to this everyday. You think? You've just got here. Everything looks wonderful. But if you were to be stuck here all your life, you sure wouldn't say that. Go on. I can only play that. Does it make you feel better? If it does, I'll play some more. Don't stare. What is it? Do you think I can cure Sao? Klao. You can't risk doing something that you don't even understand. You won't only put Sao in danger, but you'll be in danger too. No, I don't want you to do it. Much though I am worried about you, Father is even more worried. He had me drive all the way here just to see if the new medicine works. Sao. Sao. It's me, sweetie. Sao! Sao. What the hell are you doing? Can you hear me? Sao! It's me. Sao! It's all right now. I'm Klao. I'm here. Klao. I'm here. It's all right now. Sao. Klao. - Sao. - Sao. Sao. Klao. Klao! Aren't you going to tell me about Sao? Krasue From my research, it's a kind of parasite that possesses the female body for incubation. This disease spreads through saliva. Sao's father contracted it from his first lover, and passed it on to Darin. The pathogen is now living in Sao. The herbal medicine from the plant that you saw had limited efficacy. So I've added a sedative to make it work better for her. Sao's condition is very critical. And you've been giving her a sedative for over ten years? No, you can't do that. It's too dangerous. I'm positive that Klao's body will heal itself. My brother is not a lab rat. And you're not a doctor either. Klao's healing ability is something modern science still can't explain. Why are you so confident? Noi, there are people out there just like Sao. This is our chance to cure her. I'll do it. What did you say? I'll do it… if it helps Sao. Are you sure? Are you in a lot of pain… when you turn into Krasue? Yes. I don't know if the procedure will cure you. But if it'll stop you feeling more pain I'll do it. What if… it kills you? Will you still do it? No. No, I won't let it kill me. I promise. Noi. Anan. What's with the gun? You know, since I found out that my daughter is a Krasue, I've never had a good night's sleep. The more she relapses, the more unsafe she becomes. Unsafe from what? From Krahung. They feed on the Krasue's heart to survive. Pan! Give me a little more time. See this? I've found the cure. Krasue's heart is not the way out. Father! Sao. Sao. What's going on? Remember what I told you? Sao. Dad. Dad. Anan! Dad! Dad! Dad. Klao. Sao. Run! - Come with me, dad! - Run! - Run! - No, Dad… - Come with me, dad! - Sao! - Run! - No! Sao, no! Sao. Dad! Get in the car! Dad! Dad! Sao! Sao! Sao. Sao. Sao. Sao. C'mon, let's move. We must not let it find Sao. Now listen, I'll lure that thing to the other side. You take her and go that way. There's a military barracks not too far. You'll be safe there. Sao. Sao. Be strong, sweetie. Klao. Take care of her for me. Do it for me. Sao. Noi. What are you doing? Sao. - Sorry. - What are you doing, dad? I'm sorry for everything. I'm really sorry. What are you doing? Sorry, sweetie. It's going to hurt. I'm sorry! - No, dad! - Noi - Noi! - I'm sorry. Noi. No, dad, No. - Dad. - Noi. Take care, Sao. Stay strong. Please don't do this. Dad! Dad! Klao. Sao. We must keep going. We're almost there. Sao. Sao, stay with me. - Sao. - I can't fight it. Sao. Stay with me. I'm Klao. Come out now! You want a piece of me? Son of a bitch! Sao! Sao! Sao! Sao! Sao! Sao! Sao. Sao! Sao. Sao. Klao. You'll heal yourself like last time, right? You've promised. It's alright, Sao. Remember the fireflies story? I don't want the female to die. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't keep my promise. Don't you think it's strange? All white animals are highly desirable. It's not the color that makes them special. Live… Live… Live happily, Sao. If they hadn't fallen in love, neither of them would have to die. You think?
