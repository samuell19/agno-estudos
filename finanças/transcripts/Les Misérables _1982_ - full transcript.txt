If we assume that sabatier is jean valjean.. ...that doesn't prove that he stole the apples! Mr President! After the defense admits that it is valjean... I should remind you that stole 40 cents from the savoyard boy. Remember that when you send him to the galleys. From where will not grow back.

The anointed one, from Bonaparte! Like these barons there are. Baron Marius Πομερσύ! You and cards... they, they, the servants... ...and made a fool of. To be a gentleman, at least! To talk, grandpa? I believed you when you told me that the Bourbons are honest. You didn't tell me what my father was. I found out after his death! I found out that he was a hero! The Bourbons are a bunch of bastards The people kicked them out... nobody tried... ...to keep them. Do you prefer the Louis Philip? You're a fool! It's not much better than the others. And now listen: The French will retake the guns... for Napoleon the Second. And I, the son of colonel Πομερσύ... I'll call first, " long live the Emperor!" Go from here! Will not see me again! I don't want to see you again. I'm kicking you out! Marius! I left the house. And you won't come back. This time it's finished. I don't wonder. Now I need to find a room. If possible near the university. And cheap! Is that all? I have a room with 10 francs a month. I know the owner. Let's go see it! - my friend Marios Πομερσύ. - It This is the Ενζολοράς. - you Want to be with us. - Κομπφέρ! At your service! If you love freedom will do lots of things together. Λεμς! We call him barn. Because I don't know letters! I can't write my name, but I can write with freedom. The Μπαερέλ! My advice to you my friend, "Don't ever become a lawyer!" - Have you graduate? - Only in theory. I don't believe in anything. - I Believe in Ενζολορά! - Aristocrat! Have I told you not to say. I gave up my title... ...and I lost the illusions. Come on! The problem is that the political parties do whatever they want... ...and do not accept that the secret organisations are unbeatable. But if it is organisations... ...is no longer a secret! We are the France of the "Rights of man"! We teach the ideal of freedom in the whole of Europe. In Berlin, in Naples, in Madrid! Everyone was crying while singing the Marseillaise. Well done! The possible happiness is a new idea. Our fathers said: "Freedom or death!" They would rather die than to be slaves! The time has arrived! It's pushing the Louis Philip... ...we will bring back Democracy! Only the Republic will deal with those who suffer! All the hungry people! The wretches! We don't want any more miserable! Paris, 1832 Love is blind! It rains all afternoon! - Γκρατέρ you're going to the barricade. Why? I want to meet the students of the University. I saw them there! It's from yesterday afternoon. - we'll talk about them. - And You? If it is I'm talking to them and I know how to make speeches. - you just have to have a drink, Κομπφέρ! What do you mean? If the workers go to the barricades we will all follow suit. Remember, in 1830. The Κονφερακ to speak with the committees of citizens. Noted! We need to convince students of the Medical School. With regard to the barricades... I think the best point is here. And also here. This is here on the outside? I didn't choose randomly the brown Corinth for our base. Good evening, my friends! Well done! You're late an hour. Marius has lost his mind. Are you sick? Marius is in love. In love? Who loves you, "a Dream of Juliet. Ah! Her name is Juliet. No! This Juliet doesn't have a name yet! Thieves! Bastards! Calm down! I'll help you if you want. You know what I think? Equality does not exist... ...nor the dead. Look at the cemetery Tower! The greats are buried... ... in the alleys of the acacia trees. Fancy. The coffins have been silk! While the small... ...the poor... ...the unhappy... ...intellectuals and artists... ...like me... ...when they die... ...buried low in the dirt! You can't see them if you don't sink. Who do you want to see in the cemetery? For the time being anyone, but I won't be late... In the situation we're in... Don't sweat it! You get tired of writing all these letters. You write about all the illiterate... ...for a piece of bread! This is the life. You're born! Take it! Is that all? What misery! Give this to the neighbor. I found one! Who? The guy from the monastery of St. James. You said you'd come? With accurate carriage! In a coach? He is rich. Might be a Rothschild. Thank God! What do we do? Go deliver the letter to the neighbor! Break a window! You in bed! Oh, my god! If we are to fight, we need many and we need to πεισουμέ. If you believe in our cause, we need to be ready to fight. Sir Marius? I am! The next-door neighbor. I'll see you at school. The three in the "Corinth". I'll see you there! Miss! Bye-bye! What do you want? Answer me! To give you a letter! Give it to me! There's no reason to thank me! I didn't do anything! Five francs is a lot for us! At least, you buy bread. Nice is your house! What clean! A lot of books you have? We only have one. One with pictures! I've read it at least... ...twenty times! Because, you see, I know reading. Am I the only one educated. My father taught me. I've done lessons and the nuns. Listen up! "The general-Baudouin." "...assembled 5 battalions." "In the middle of the plain..." "... of Waterloo." Waterloo? My father fought there! He was a sergeant. I know and I write! Look! Can I write it?
