Aww yeah! Barcelona! We're gonna get some fucking pussy! Yeah! Aw, shit. Peter? Come on, man. Okay. We're just gonna... Ugh... Ugh, it's gross. I hate you. Can you just leave me... - What are you mumbling? Come on, use your words. Enunciate. - She fucking left me, man. She left me. Aw, fuck, man! You are the most disgusting roommate in the world 'Kay. Peter, this is a very important video, and you're gonna thank me for this later. You're-- What do- what do you think you're doing? Nothing lasts forever. You know this. Dude, you don't know anything. Yeah, dude. I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do, okay? You spent the last six years tied to some chick. You call it love, I call it a waste of time. Okay? - Fuck you. Hey! 'Kay? She's your ex-girlfriend now, and she doesn't deserve any respect. I just want a fucking girlfriend, man. Dude. Look at yourself! You're disgusting. What-- Why would you ever wanna go through something like this for a girl? Okay, man? Okay? I know what's going through your mind, you wanna call her. I'll tell you what, man, she doesn't wanna accept any of your phone calls. And that's disgusting. Aww... Okay, dude? She doesn't wanna hear from you. You gotta accept that because I have a better plan for us. You wanna know what that is? Includes... ...sun, beach, hot babes, beautiful weather, beautiful city, okay? Five days is all I ask. If you want Lisa when we come back, I will help you get her myself. I don't want your help. - Yeah, you sure about that? - Yeah. Dude... We're going to Bar-- Peter! We're going to Barcelona! Dude! We're going to Barcelona! ** Dude, what the... There's my bag. Wait. No. Fuck! Such a fucking idiot! I swear I'm gonna fucking kill you one day, man. You're such a fucking baby. Yeah, you better run, you pussy! It's the last time you do this shit to me! Hey, buddy. How was your bath? We had a pretty good day today, right? I mean, that one chick in the red bikini wanted me so hard, and if she didn't have that kid, we would be gettin' it on right now. Right? Yeah, getting dressed like a big boy! I like it! Well, I got something in store for you, my friend! Let's take a look-see. Right here. Look what we have here. What is that? This... my friend... ...is the passport to the vagina. Absinthe? The real deal! No... They don't make this stuff anymore. They sell it everywhere here! Cool. The fuck you doing? Make a toast. - After you. - No! You're such a little girl. - Yes, after you. 'Kay, since the baby won't do it, I'm gonna make a toast to Barcelona. I love it here. Careful with your teeth. Yeah! Let's play some music. Pass me that iPod, sir. - Just be careful with it. - Okay, okay. All right, all right. * We are gonna get down tonight * * Uh-huh Oh, yeah, all right. I don't like that shit, and... There we go. What are you doing? Dude, you're totally sending a message to her. Dude... Give it back. No, dude, you told me that you would forget about her for this vacation. Yeah, but it's not that easy. I can't just forget about her. What are you doing? I'm taking out the SIM card. I'm gonna take out mine, too. When you try to steal it later-- - Don't... Give it back! Calm down! God... I'm sorry, it's just... This is her favorite song, and you just put this shit on. What is wrong with you? Then fuck this song! Come on, man. Why do you look so sad? Cheer up! Wanna change the song? We're gonna change the song. All right. This night's gonna be unforgettable! This is way too gay. So, what's the plan tonight, Tonio? It's our first night here, and it's what I like to call the "sizing up" night, 'kay? We see what's cookin' in town, and then, we make our first contact with the local girls. So, you're saying we're not gonna score tonight? Dude, who said that? All right, sizing up takes a matter of minutes. Yeah... Well, I've known you a long time, man, and, uh, if I can count right, I think it's... yeah, um, one. You've only had sex with one girl your entire life. Uh, two. No one knows that for sure. There's no proof. All I'm saying is, it took you 23 years just to convince one girl to let you stick your penis inside her. What makes you think tonight's gonna be so different? What's your strategy here? I'm gonna be myself. 'Cause that's worked so well for you already, right? We're in Barcelona, okay? Studies show, uh... Easiest, hottest girls in the world. Cheap alcohol, and they love it when you drink it. And the bars don't close 'til the sun comes up, al right? And you forget that we are Americans. Well, you've been American your whole life, too. Has that ever gotten you laid? We are in Barcelona, okay? They treat us like gods here for some reason. And... you know... They hear the accent, they just kinda form a line. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you Cuba litro, five bucks! To Barcelona. Chug, chug! Come on, drink it all! Faster, man! Cuba litro, five dollars, let's see what you got! Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Keep going! There's so much left! Come on! Finish it off! No, wait, wait! There's a little bit left. Gotta keep going. - Fuck you. Whoo! Watch as the Tonio approaches a female specimen for his mating ritual. He is out of his element as he approaches the Spaniard. He is lost. He's a baffling buffoon, but he tries his best. His rituals are poor at best, but watch, wait! He goes for his greatest skill, the hair swipe behind the ear. Nothing. Whoa! But out of surprise, the alpha male attacks, defeating our imbecilic asshole. I feel bad. Why? You should feel embarrassed. That guy has no idea his girl is about to leave him tonight. Well, I guess we made a friend. What's up, man? You got a... ...a name? Here, it's yours. Take it easy. Do you wanna get outta here? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are you doing? Peeing. What the fuck, man?! Are you serious? It's steaming. Oh, my God, that's disgusting! Why the hell did you do that? Wait a second. I feel bad. I feel bad! Let's make a toast! Let's make a toast. 'Kay? To you. To you. Get the fuck outta here! Go left! Left! Wait, stop, stop! I don't think he's behind us. What the fuck? Why'd you do that? Coast is clear. Nobody steals a girl... ...from Tonio. Crazy. Are- are you okay, man? Dude, you're panting like an old dog. Peter, do you need something? Aw, you motherfucker! Nobody steals a girl from Tonio. No, but uh... I'm really having an asthma attack. Perfect, perfect. Where to? The hotel. Stop, stop fucking around. What, you haven't had enough yet? Enough what? Everything. Peeing in beer bottles, running from crazy boyfriends, come on. Dude, I haven't had enough of anything, especially girls, that's why we're here. - It's why you're here. - We! You. Look, I'm really tired. I just wanna go home and get some sleep. Okay, you're being an infant! It is one in the morning here! 'Kay, that means the night has just begun. Here, take this, take this. Ah, you don't wanna party, you want girls, man! - Yes! - Yes... - All right-- - Girls! Boy, you have to go to Apollo, man. - How do I, how do I get there? - You see girls, man? Apollo, where Apollo? It's right there, man. Nice, thank you! Thank you! Awesome. Fucking awesome. Apollo? I don't know, man. I'm tired. I don't wanna go out anymore. What! So great! We gotta celebrate! Get some drinks! Uh, let's go upstairs! Ohh, whiskey! Por favor, se√±or. 'Sup, dude? Shots! What, you got, you got two? You gonna do both? Yeah, no, I'm gonna drink a lot, but one of these are for you. That's funny, I thought I told you I'm not drinking tonight, man. I don't want any. I don't want anything to do with any alcohol. The fuck? Dude, don't be such a wet blanket. I don't wanna drink. All right? Why? Why would you possibly not wanna drink? Do I have to remind you what happened last time? Yeah! Okay. All right, so here's a recap for you. You took me to a party, you got me so fucking wasted that I ended up kissing another girl while my girlfriend was at the party, that I didn't know of. She saw me, and then she fucking broke up with me, huh. Now my relationship is ruined. My life is fucking over due to alcohol and, possibly, you. Isn't that a good enough reason? Yeah, 'cause I really forced that girl's tongue down your throat, but that's not even the point! Okay, we are in a different country across the world! Okay, you're with your best friend, and you know, you told me that you were gonna at least forget about her for tonight. - Yeah, I know, but I just don't think I'm ready yet, okay? You can't be serious! Dude, come out of it. Ohh-- Don't move, don't move. Mamma mia! Ohh, you talk to her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is it. This is it. This is your time. This is your shot. Come on, man. Dude, I'm not gonna let you-- I'm not gonna let you pussy out. Hola. Hola. You're not from here, isn't it? No, no, no. I'm from, um... You know Buffalo... New York? - Ohh, Americano. - Yeah, yeah. You like this place? Yeah, it's cool. Apollo. Look, your drink's already here. You're not going to buy me a drink? No, no, no, no. You're weird. Sorry. Bye. - Am I dreaming right now? You're always dreaming. Dude, you just let one of the hottest girls I've ever seen walk away! You know people pay thousands of dollars to have sex with girls like that. Okay, good for them. All right? I-- No! You don't like girls, that's what you're telling me! That you're- you're coming out to me right now. I like Lisa, okay? That's all. Well, Lisa made it pretty clear she doesn't want you anymore! She broke up with you! You called her hundreds upon hundreds of times last week. She didn't answer a single time. Okay? She's probably out boning some other guy. That's fucked up. Come on, Peter. Do you really think she would do that? Yeah, probably. I mean, that's how people are. In order to move on and forget about someone, you find somebody else. That's the way it works, okay? But what are- what are you doing, man? You're ruining your night. Y-you're kinda ruining my night now, and for what, huh? Is it fair? Is that fair? No. You're right. It's not fair. So let's get some justice. Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! That is awesome! Yes! My man! My man! Let's go get some bitches. Hey, show some respect! Show some respect! Yo! Yo! Whoo! Hey, man! You got- you gotta get up to get down! Yeah, like... like that! Okay! You're getting the start, but you need some... you need, like, girls dancing. I don't want to-- She should be dancing with you. Go find that girl! She's... The one that was hitting on you, man. What...? All right, yeah. Move like that! That's- that's good, man. You gotta get ones like those! No, you just look weird-- She's right there, man! Holy shit! That's fucking fate! That is... That-- Those hips! No, look at her! Don't look over... Look at her! Go dance with her! All right, I'm not joking around. There's no rejection. Look at this! Yeah! Oh, shit! I guess I'm gonna have to show this to Lisa! Nah, you're cool, look at you! You're walking! Like a professional! Holy crap. Yeah, you're good. No, dude, I called first! No. Uh-uh. No way. Not tonight. Look at my girl, she's gonna pass out in 20 minutes. I don't care, that's your problem. What are we talking about? - Okay, we only, we only have one bed. - Really? Yeah, this asshole thought it'd be funny. It's not so much, is it? - Well, that's actually great. - It is? Yeah, so we could have a four way. Get the fuck out of here! I'm joking. We could go to my grandparents' house. There are a lot of beds, and nobody lives there, so I guess we're all right with that? Yeah. Yeah, for sure, that's cool. It's all right. - For the four way! This house is very old, but the beds still work. No, no, no. Tonio. Oh, be careful with the stick. If the door closes, you won't be able to get out. Dude, throw away the stick, so we can fuck forever. Come on, guys. This is the house of romance, and I'm here with my new friend... Noemi, and we're just having a magical evening with the great Tonio, and it's only gonna get better from here, isn't that so, Noemi? Just act drunk and confused if you agree. Okay, now, we're only one step at a time, and we're here! I'm excited. Here's your room. All right, wait for Tonio in here, uh, don't be afraid to get started without me. Come on, Peter. Come on. You wouldn't be with Little Miss Thing right here if it wasn't for me getting you to step up tonight and man the fuck up, so dude, I just need one little favor from you. What? Record this! I gotta see this chick naked. - You're that perverted? - Yeah, obviously. Are you serious? Dude, don't be selfish, okay? Are you gonna film you and your little ratchet in there? Uh, yeah. What do you think this is? To share the wealth. Fine. Attaboy! I'm not promising anything. Go get her, tiger! Uh, hey, doggy! What are you doing? Oh, I-I'm just, um... You wanna do a movie, huh? You have some music on your phone? No, not on my phone, but I do here. No, not this song. Hey. You think maybe we could just change the song. Shh. Where you going? Oh, shit, that's not right. Whoa, okay. My God... Okay. Holy shit. Give me that. Wait, th-this isn't a good idea. Can... We could just... maybe... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't. I just can't do this. Okay, um... I-- So are you gonna get naked or what? I'm tired. All right, so then start now, so we can go to bed earlier. Come on, put some... ...effort into it. I can't, I'm tired. Come on, baby. That's all you got? - Let's get this over with. - Okay. Fuck! No, no, don't stop. Don't stop, don't stop. Dude, what the fuck are you doing? We have to go. Why would we ever have to leave this place? Because you have to take me to the hospital. I have to take you to the hospital? Holy fucking cock! What the fuck?! - What's going on? Dude, what the fuck happened to you? I don't know how-- I told her I didn't wanna do anything, and she bit me You told her you didn't-- You deserve it for being a weirdo. Look, we have to go. Dude, you see what I have? I don't give a shit what you have. Do you see what I have? All right, all right, 15 minutes. No! All right, we're leaving now. You could bring her to the hotel with us. You know, you can have the room, I don't care. Let's just go. - Oh, God damn it. All right, you wanna go to the hotel? We'll go to the hotel, okay? - I just want to sleep. - Okay, all right, that's a yes. That's a yes. All right, Peter, it's a yes. - Let's go! Now! - All right, okay. Noemi. No sleep time, no, no. No, no, we go. We go now, fun time still. Yay. I just wanna make this video so that everybody out there knows Peter is capable of ruining even the most perfect night. I mean, if God himself told me that we'd leave here without being laid, I would slap him in the face with my cock. - Cut it out. - Cut it out, dude, you have to admit, tonight-- Wait, you think I wanted this to happen? Oh, I forgot my watch. I hope you're proud of yourself. Can you just leave me alone? Dude, I'm fucking with you! Okay? Does it hurt? - Of course it does. All right, let me see it. No, I'm not gonna show you my dick. - Yeah, 'cause I really wanna see your dick-- - Maybe you do. Dude, I just wanna know if I should have to worry or not. Okay. Oh, this little thing? You're such a girl! Where you going? - Outside. Dude, we have to wait for her. I need to get some air. Watch out for the stick. Are you sure you don't wanna stay? She doesn't look like she bites twice. It's locked. I guess we have to ask your girlfriend for the key. Great, this is the last thing I need right now. No problemo. Turn that shit off. Do you wanna see or not? Yeah, just get it outta my face. All right, so stop complaining. Shit. So what do we do now? Well, I guess we gotta go up and ask her to open the door for us, right? Hello? Hola? Noemi. - What are you doing? - Noemi, she's not here. She's probably puking in the bathroom. Hello? Why don't you try using her name? I don't know it. Hello? She must be up here. Hello? Hello? Yo! I'm sorry for what happened before. Yeah. Whatever. Can you just open the door downstairs for us? Yeah, the keys are upstairs. Have you seen the other girl? She's over there. I will be right back. Noemi? Drunk bitch is passed out somewhere. Let's find her. What a guy... Oh, shit. What the...? What the fuck have we got ourselves into? Noemi? Noemi? Noemi? Noemi? Did you hear that? Turn it off! Turn it off! Do you see that light? Is that light? Yeah, yeah. Let's go. You start. Let me do it. Take this. What is this? It's her. It's all her. "Desgracia en Barcelona." Disgrace in Barcelona? What the fuck? Who is this chick? Do I fucking know, man? Look at this shit-- Oh, fuck! What the fuck is...? Holy shit... Oh, my God. - Oh, we're fucked. - And it's your fault All you talk about, hittin' on girls with your stupid bullshit. Look what you got us into! How would I have known this would happen?

What are you doing? I gotta see Lisa again. What? Oh my God, Peter. You're insane, you fucking hulk. I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna fucking find this bitch, and I swear to you, she's gonna let me out. And then I'm gonna find the first flight home, and I'm gonna leave, with or without you, okay? Wait a minute. - No. I've waited long enough already, all right? Take this.

They raped and murdered her! They fucking burned her, now she's back from beyond the grave! Since when do you believe in ghosts?! Look! You've seen her up close, man. She's all burned. I don't fucking care what she is, I'm getting the fuck out of here! I have to see Lisa. We can't go anywhere, man. She's gonna kill us. Shut the fuck up! Someone named rubianca69 is sending me a video message through bluetooth. It's my phone! It's my phone! What the hell? Let's go! No way! It can't be that easy!

Girlfriend? I don't know what you're talking about. Hello? Who is this? It's Peter. I'm an American. Why are you talking to my son? Look, we're trapped. Where are you trapped? In Barcelona in this fucking crazy person's house. Stop joking, kid. It's not a fucking joke, all right?! We're in her fucking grandpa's house, and there's-- We're fucking trapped! Where is this house? Where is it?! Where are we?! Where the fuck are we?! I don't know! I don't remember! I was really drunk! We don't know. Look, it's just a really fucking old house, and there's fucking dead bodies here. Just figure something out! Go find someone else, you punks. If you talk to my son again, I will call the police. Are you serious, sir?! Sir, listen! Answer, please! What the fuck?! I hope you and your fucking shitty son kill yourselves! My purse! My phone... is not here! What a surprise! You've gotta be shitting me! Give me that fucking thing! Peter, what are we gonna do? It's barbed wire. What the fuck are you doing?! Getting out of here! Fucking shit! It's the fucking virgin, man! It's the fucking virgin! What the hell? We gotta take her to the hospital. We have to take her to the hospital. I have to go home. My mom thinks I'm studying. She wants- She wants her mother. She wants her mother. You killed her. You fucking killed Noemi. You don't smoke. Peter, what's happening to you? Don't you realize what you just did? Put that shit out, man. Put that sh-- Listen to me. You just killed a person. - It was an accident. You just gotta calm down. I just have to get home to Lisa. How the fuck am I gonna explain this to her? Explain what? The fucking scar on my dick, man. What the fuck am I gonna say? Can't think about that right now, man. Listen. We have to stay together. Fucking gasoline! What are you doing? Get over here! Shit. You okay, man? What's wrong? What's wrong? Breathe. Breathe. No, no, no. Oh, fuck oh, fuck. The asthma. Oh, shit. Where's your inhaler? Where's your inhaler? I'll be right back. Go, go. Go, go, go. Pete- Peter, I got it. Help! Help! Please help! Help! Peter. Peter. Fuck you! We're goin' home! Wake up. Wake up, man. Breathe. What took you so long? I fucking found an exit, man, and I killed her. Your fucking hands. Shit. In the kitchen... Right, let's fucking go. Peter, come on. We have to get out of here. Come on, hurry up. We gonna see Lisa? Yes, you will, very soon. I have to get back to her. You will, man. That's the door. Go ahead, open it. Are you sure? Obviously I'm fucking sure. I was just in there. Oh, no, this can't be happening. No. What the fuck, man? We have to find another way out. Are you lying to me? Lying? Are you lying to me? Lying about what? I don't know. It took you so long to get the inhaler. I just told you, man, the door was open, I went inside, and she attacked me. I don't know. I think you're trying to get rid of me. Get rid of you? I'm really trying to figure out what the fuck you're talking about. That's what I think. For real. Why would I want to get rid of you? Fuckin'... I don't know. I think... ...you're trying to get revenge for your girlfriend. Girlfriend? Are you crazy or what? I could have escaped and came back for you. The least you could do is act remotely sane. It's Noemi's phone! We're saved. Shit, we won't be able to get it. You can grab it. We're drenched in gasoline, Peter. I don't care. You got me into this shit... ...and I need to get home and fix things with Lisa. But, dude-- I'm not doin'-- Hurry up! - Shut the fuck up! They're gonna hang up! Do you wanna live or not?! Oh fuck. Shit. Fucking... It's an alarm, man. She took out the SIM card. Let me see. It's not working. Show me! You don't believe me? No. You fucking believe me now? Why did you make me kiss that girl at the party? What? At Michael's party, when Lisa caught me. You insisted I kiss that other girl. Why?! You really think this is what we should be talking about right now? Why not?! Maybe because we're drenched in gasoline and there's a crazy, psycho bitch trying to kill us. I thought you killed her. Was that a lie too? I thought I killed her, I told you. I fought her in the kitchen, then I stabbed her in the face. What happened at the party?! Shit. Okay. I told Lisa to come, okay? I wanted her to see you hook up with a girl. Happy? You know why I did it. I don't fucking care why you did it. You still did it. I hope you're fucking dying and I never see you again. He did it on purpose. Tear Lisa away from me. Took her. Piece of shit. He always wanted her too, I know it. I gotta get out. Fuck you, Tonio! He fuckin' tricked me. He got me out. I didn't wanna. Why am I here, Tonio? Where are you hiding, bitch?! Hey! Come on out of there! * Hey. Hey! Turn around. Turn around! Tonio? Oh man, I'm sorry. I thought you were the dead girl. Did you see her? - No. I'm so sorry. So this is how you treat your friends, huh? Don't fucking touch me. Man, I told you I thought you were the dead girl. Where are you going? Don't ever touch me again! Is- is this about Lisa? She cheated on you... ...with Sam. Saw them making out at the bar. Stop lying! I'm not lying. That's why I did that at the party. That's why I called her. I thought you wouldn't be able to handle the fact that she was cheating on you. I thought it would be easier... if she just left you. It's her! It's her! Oh, shit! Fucking get her! Fucking bitch! Yes! Get her now! Tonio, you fuck! Fuck you, Tonio! Fuck you! Fuck you, Tonio! She's dead! Fucking bitch! What, man? We have to find an exit. You can put the f- the knife down. An exit? For what? So you can finish your master plan? What master plan? This, the party. Don't act like an idiot. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Lisa played you like a fool, not me. You know why you did it, though? Because I'm your friend? You liked Lisa. I knew since the first day, you were always jealous of me. You've been planning this for years. And now you're trying to convince me that she cheated on me... when I know she wouldn't do that! Dude, do you understand what you're saying?! Fucking lunatic! I saw her cheating on you with my own two eyes. I never liked her as a person. In fact, I hate her! She sucks. I did everything that I did because of our friendship. Peter... Put that knife down right now! Tonio, don't be a pussy! Dry your fucking face! I'm gonna kill you, Tonio! I swear I'm gonna kill you! What the fuck is that thing? Jesus, I don't wanna die. Please, I don't wanna die. I'm still young. I don't want-- I want to go home. I- I have to go home now. Help me... Help me... I know you're there. Help me, please. Please. Go away, you demon. What did I ever do to you? What? - Please. Listen to me. I just need your help. Yeah, right, ghost bitch. You wanna kill me. Wait, wait, wait. I know how to get out of here. - How? You have to unchain me. No, you wanna kill me. I don't wanna kill you. It's my sister. What the fuck? You're the burned one? Yeah. Please don't stare. I thought you were a ghost. No, there is no ghost. It's my sister. She's dead. We need to get out of here. No, I'm not falling for your trick. You don't have any other choice. The key is over there. Please hurry. Where is it? It's the third from the right. Let's go. Let's go. Get the fuck out of here. Follow me. Tonio! Oh, Tonio! Come out and play! Where are you? Come on Tonio! Hurry. I'm gonna fucking kill you! That is fucking shit, man. That is some fucking heavy shit. That's the exit. Wait, I'll find the key. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on! It's locked. I'm doing my best. What is all this shit? What the fuck is this? What-- What the fuck? What-- I thought you were gonna help me. What's wrong? What-- You're not-- Who are you? Don't you recognize me? No, I-- I didn't mean to hurt you! I was just so scared! Now she's a fucking ghost. Oh, Peter, I love you! You're my best friend! I can honestly say that I have never been happier to see you. Now we can find an exit. There is no exit. Of course there is. We just need to find it. Bet you didn't see this ending coming, huh? No, now we can get out of here. You thought you could take my girlfriend so easily. You thought I wouldn't even care. Peter, I already told you, I don't wanna steal your shitty girlfriend. She was cheating on you. Do you know... what they used to do to liars? Come on. Open up. I said open up! Look, I'm Tonio. You wanna go get some girls? Why don't you hit on that girl over there? Why don't you kiss her? Why don't you just shut the fuck up?! You see this? This is what they used to do to liars. Unfortunately for you, I'm a little more tough! Hi, Lisa. I just wanted to let you know that I miss you... ...and this trip and being here is... ...well, truly made me realize how important... ...you are to me. I know I made a mistake... ...but I hope that, in time... ...you'll realize... ...that that's all it was. A mistake. I love you, Lisa. You're the only one I've ever loved. I know that I'm the only one for you, too. I hope... ...that when you watch this... ...you'll follow me. And if you follow me... ...this won't be the end... ...but a whole new beginning. One where we can finally be alone together... ...forever... ...without anybody bothering us... ...or telling us what to do... ...the way it always should have been. Just you and me. I love you, Lisa. I'll be waiting for you. I hope to see you soon.
