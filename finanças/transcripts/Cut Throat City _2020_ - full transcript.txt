Let's get right into the Gulf of Mexico still tracking and monitoring the path and the progress and the strengthening of Hurricane Katrina. This is gonna be one of the more powerful hurricanes we've ever seen. With the expectation of it to become a category four on Monday, when it's expected to come ashore. So this is just quite a monster. Now listen, you niggas! I will not waste my breath on you with a cleverly worded, articulate warning. You will come out... or die! And we will burn your ass like we did Harley over here. You have ten seconds to live. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one. Burn! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! Burn them! And that's it. Yo, that shit's fire, bro. You created a world of your own, man. - Yo! Hey! - Damn! It's cool and all, but it don't really reflect the 5-4. Not enough reality. I mean, you gotta keep it real, dawg. Yeah, they should have made your ass stupider and uglier too. - Fuck you. - All right. Look. Graphic novels are supposed to be fictional, man. You know, it's a form of escapism, bro. That's what the weed is for. Yeah. Go ahead and pass that while you at it. But you can still keep it real, even if it ain't. Like The Godfather. That shit fake, but you can feel the realness in them Mafia motherfuckers. Everything don't have to be this over-the-top Tarantino shit. You crazy. Reservoir Dogs was the shit. Overrated. Plus, he say the word "nigga" too much. You say the word "nigga" too much. Wait, wait. What's too much? Like, Lil' Wayne numbers? I don't know. But there gotta be, like, a... a "nigga" threshold. Especially if you white. Nigga does have a point. What the fuck does that make me, then? I don't know, nigga, we gotta figure you out. You a watered-down Creole right now. - Fuck you. - Right. Give me my damn book, man. Y'all niggas don't know art when you see it. This my art. Right here. Nigga, you brought that on my wedding day? It's a bad neighborhood. Nigga, put that shit away. All right. You giving up all the pussy for one. Just locked down. I don't know how you do it. I think it's love, man. I need to get over there to take these damn photos. I'm getting married, huh? - Ahhh, get it! - Get it! - Get it! - Get it! Get the fuck up! I want you to listen to something here. You're not the reason I'm marrying your mom. You're the reason I'm gonna stay with my baby. - All right? - Okay. Ball 'em up, ball 'em up, block, block, block. Doo, doo, doo, block 'em up! Okay, right hand. Left hand. Right hand. Look at you. - How's that dress feel? - Tight. I wish your father was here. Mom, were you happy on your wedding day? I'm gonna tell you something that your grandmother told me, D. It's not always about happiness. It's about meaning. I'll take that as a nope. Find the meaning. Happiness will come later. You look beautiful. Thanks, Mom. Hurricane Katrina - may extend from southeast... - Hurry up! We're late. Louisiana, as we know, all the way into Kentucky and southern parts of Illinois and Indiana. We finally get a black woman in office, and she fuckin' giving hurricanes black people names. Shit, I wouldn't mind a piece of Hurricane Fashawnya, - you know what I'm saying? - You right about that, son. She can blow my way any day, baby. Man, they sent the motherfuckers over here. Man, got the technology from the Russians. What? Hurricanes and shit. They been using them for years to kill black people. That and Viagra. - Damn, boy. - Laugh. Oh, yeah. - Want some Viagra right now? - You using Viagra already? I'm America's worst nightmare. A nigga with a gun and a hard-on. What? He's my best friend, Mama. And... I'm his best man, and I don't even know what to say. Hmm. You've known James since kindergarten, yeah? You ain't gotta say anything, baby. Blinky Blink! Yeah! Shit! Look at that shit! I don't really know what to say in front of a big crowd. But, uh... to my best friend... and his best lady Storm's coming. Katrina hit New Orleans on August 29th, 2005. The worst hurricane to date. The fact is, if there was evera city not meant to take Katrina that would be New Orleans. The governor of Louisiana said today that she is considering the remarkable step of evacuating the remaining residents of New Orleans. And with much of New Orleans now underwater, authorities are focused on search and rescue. If ever the cavalry was needed, it is now, and it is in New Orleans. The flooding here is getting worse after waters from Lake Pontchartrain broke through a levy. And when you pull back for a wide shot, the scene is nothing short of apocalyptic. There you go, baby. You look good. Wow. I don't know about this shirt, though, babe. I know about that shirt. Mm? Mm? Oy! When it get like this? Babe, it's been like that. That's three months. Daddy gonna come take care of this, huh? Okay. - Hm? - Baby, while you're out.... Go on, you're gonna be late. Isaiah, take care of your mom, all right? - Go on, Dad. - I'm getting. Come on, woadie. This ain't no dub. This shit imported from Cali, son. Atomic Dog. Well, give me somethin' from closer. This shit is small. Let me get like two for 30 or something. If you don't get the fuck outta here - before I bust yo' snot box... - Beat it. What's up, Woad? See, I like that customer service there, baby. He trying to get a discount. Katrina done wiped all my shit away. Shit. Not everything. You got the stuff? Cousin niggas doing some bullshit. Big fish, little fish. Come on. Watch 'em! Watch 'em! Watch 'em! Get 'em! Kill 'em! All right, out! Out! Come here. - What's happenin'? - What's up? Oh, man. What's happening, bro? What's up? Shit, what's up? Get the big bro hands up. Okay, all right. - Ready to start, huh? - Watch out. Watch out. That's the best you got? That's the best you got? Oh, shit! Uh-oh. I'm gonna come for you! - Oh! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh! - Do better than that. All right. All right. - Whoa. Whoa. - Whoa. Whoa. Yo, yo, Blink, Miracle. You ready for this shit? See him? Get him! Watch him! Watch him! Get him! Get him! Kill him, boy! - Take that. Yeah, kill it. - Damn! The hell is that? Oh, this be my big ticket, man. - Band Dog. - All right. Half lover, half killer. Half motherfuckin' ugly. That's three halves, Sesame Street. Fuck you, Miracle. This is a beautiful dog. Very protective. It's the shit overseas. I start breedin' 'em, puppies sell for 750 a pop. - Shit. - I can make that off a quarter. Tsk. Man, if you ain't smoke it all first. I'm gonna get one of them shirts off the line. Yeah, get one of my dad's shirts. Once I get my shit up and running, boom! Buy me some hooks, drop my album. - Whoopdie-whoo! You know? - Whoopdie-whoo! But I ain't goin' by Miracle no more. I'm gonna go by Teasy. As in "Tea-Z." You feel me? I feel you. Wait, wait, wait. - Tea-Z? - What the fuck is Tea-Z, man? - Tea-Z! - Tea-Z! Your real rap name, nigga, should be Lay-Z. That's what the fuck it should be, man. Fuck you. Oh, man. I... I didn't make shit this morning, bro. Damn, we all broke, man. Blink, why don't we talk to your cousin? He ain't my cousin, Junior. That's Demyra's people. We don't need to be hittin' up that trailer park-ass, party-ass nigga, man. He get us all killed. They're FEMA trailers. FEMA's a goddamn joke. Hey, he turned that shit into a fucking mansion. Look, man, all right, even if Blink's cousin is cousin now, man, still, that dude a gangsta, and he make me nervous. And what the hell are we? We ain't no gangstas. You sure as hell ain't a good dope dealer, bro. In fact, you about the brokest-ass dope dealer - I know on this block, man. - Yeah, yeah. We don't need FEMA, all right? We sure as hell don't need cousin, Junior. We good. We gonna be all right. Talk to a nigga. What I'm looking like? What the fit look like? - White. - Real white. White. Come sit. Let me see. Derivative. Derivative. Fair. Have you been published? At Tulane's school paper. And you never graduated? Just associate's. Did you use a toothbrush for this background? Yes, sir. Okay. I don't know, you know? They... they need some time to incubate, but James... Just call me Blink. Tell me, James, um, who are your inspirations? Charles Schulz. I grew up on Peanuts. Um, Gary Larson. Um... Uh, Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Yeah, okay, yeah, I meant in life. Who do you want to see coming to Cut Throat City, James? I... I'm not sure. I never really thought about it. The first thing you think about is your audience. Well, if we only focus on our market, then a cartoon would never be anything more than a cheap, dim commodity, that would never... change, you know? It'll never... Yeah. I don't know who's giving you that advice, but it's... Actually, I, I got it from you. Um, an anime expo, 1990. I got a transcript from the library. Fair enough. Thanks for coming in. Send the next one. Baby, what you doing? Puttin' this stuff up. I'm gonna change this room into a game room for Ike. What's the plan, babe? I'll figure it out. Do what I gotta do. Babe, we can still apply for FEMA aid. No, no, I don't wanna do that. No. No. They'll come here, try to take the house. No. It's they fault we in this mess anyway. I'm handling it. I ain't gonna play the blame game, James. We gotta take responsibility for our actions. Responsibility? This whole goddamn situation is... based on lack of responsibility, Demyra. The governor blame the mayor and the mayor blame the fucking president. The president blame FEMA. You talking to me about fucking responsibility. What you think? What you think, I get to go downtown and fill out a application, salary desired, and, what, "Yeah, Blink, we just... We looking for a nigga like you. Yeah. Yeah, we looking for a nigga like you." - Enough. - "We out here. Come on in." Enough with the Yat speak. You got a name, James. You got a name. My pa gave me that nickname, a'right? You hear me? Yeah, your pop gave you a nickname that stuck. Too bad he didn't. He left my mama, all right? He ain't leave me. Baby, you a talented, educated black man. You went to Tulane. Well, none of that matter. No, 'cause I'm still in the Ninth Ward. Yeah, we still here. But we can go anywhere we want, baby. - Anywhere we want. - Oh, yeah? No, we can't. That's the whole issue. It's my problem. We was underwater before Katrina, D. And they rebuilding all this shit. What about us? Huh? What about the 5-4? We the last goddamn ward to see a fucking dime! What the fuck is that about, huh? Goddamn ward! We good, I got you. Don't worry about nothin'. You don't gotta worry about nothin'. I'm not worried. What's happenin', wo? Andre! I'm coming in. There it is, bro. What did he say? He said nobody was gonna publishmy strip calledCut Throat City. Blink, come on, man. You know you can't listen to that bro. I got D and Ike now. Yeah. Mama. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. James, get your ass down off my counter. - Sorry. - Dre, how was your commute home? Not too good. Not much traffic. You hear anything from Second Line? It's hard to make it out here as a musician, Mama. - Especially now. - I love you, Dre. But I can't afford to take care of a grown man. Mama, come on. You need to stop worrying about me, Mama. Now you know I'm gonna be a famous jazz musician - just like Miles Davis. - Hmm. I'll buy you that big old house you always wanted, right? Go ahead and take care of that album cover and whatever, you hear it? Well, Mr. Basquat and Mr. Gillespie, in the meanwhile, save some of that baloney for your sister. Hey. Remember, you boys can dream, but best hope around here, your money. Current and pre-disaster address? The same. Insurance? Total household income? Thirty-two thousand. I'll need copies of your tax returns. Yeah. So, what, we... we eligible, or what's up? Well, it depends on what type of assistance. There's repair. There's temp housing. There's replacement housing. What about replacement? Well, this type of assistance only happens in insular areas or remote locations specified by FEMA. Unfortunately, the Ninth Ward isn't covered. Why am I not fucking surprised? - Baby... - Here's your own form. We... We... um... We got insurance, so I don't understand why. Y'all niggas just don't get it. This happened just how they want it. Why you think the 17th Street levy blew on the black side of town and not the white? Gravity? Ain't no gravity, and ain't no conspiracy. First, they flood us, then they pushing us out, then they buy all our land with those bullshit FEMA checks. Then they sellin' 'em to the casinos. That's just a fact. Man, Cousin's makin' it rain out here. With FEMA here and no cops, like a goddamn candy store. He gettin' his hustle on, he gotta need some soldiers. Me and June was hollering, we was figuring maybe we make a move with him. We all need the money. Blink? Let's holler at him. That's it. Come on! Come on! Get his neck! Get his neck! - Come on, come on! - Get in there. Yeah! - You like that, come on. - Yeah. Yeah. Get him up! Come on. Get up! Get up! - Get up! Get up! - No, no, no! Fred Sanford wins. Yeah. That's some bullshit, yo! That shit was amped! Fuck you say? I said the rat was amped. Amped or not, you better have my money, bitch. Where my little niggas at? Get your ass up here. You being stupid? It was amped. It was amped. So, what brings you motherfuckers to Oz? You do know you in Oz, don't you? Yeah. You got the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow. I guess that make you Dorothy. Yeah, we got Toto in the car too, Cousin. You came all this way to make me laugh? Crazy-ass picture. Hm. Well, as a matter of fact, it is. Did y'all know "Katrina" means purification? Yeah. It provided the perfect opportunity for the long-awaited pretext for accelerated gentrification. That's fucked up how they did us. Yeah, Uncle Sam a motherfucker, huh, bro? You could say what you want about they methodology, but... If you get at the personal shit, study they motives, you'll find that we ain't that different. Mm-mm. There's one thing about us that is very much the same. We all some greedy-ass motherfuckers. Black or white. Rich or poor. That's what make us American. Now, if you gonna roll wit' me, you better do just that 'cause I ain't got time for no tourists. I don't hold no niggas' hands. And don't you think just 'cause you married into my blood that you mean somethin' to me. I'm in it for the money. That's it. I ain't gonna let no nigga fuck it up for me. Ya heard me? Not you, or any of these little goofy-looking motherfuckers you brought in here with you. Say, Cousin, this nigga ass-bet. At my game? That's ballsy. Well, you guys are just in time to be useful. What should I do with him? Come to my game, he give his word, he say he got money. If he'd have won, he'd have wanted to get paid, and we'd have paid him. But he betting on his ass. He should walk the plank. Come on, Cousin, don't do me like that. No, no, you do it to yourself now. Come on, man. Nah, please, come on, man! Don't be shy now. Drop 'em. Go. You might want to look away for this part. Fuck, man. His dick! Get his ass out of here. Two things in the world I sure can't stand. That's a lying-ass woman, and a crying-ass man. Hmm. Oh, well. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go! - You like that? - Come on. But, Blink, why the fuck I gotta drive? Why white chocolate head ass can't drive? It's your fucking van. I'm not trying to stay in the van with that dumbass dog, man. I'm trying to get out there and get active too. Fine, I'll fucking drive then. Bitch, you ain't driving my van. What the fuck you want, then? You want me to drive your slow fucking van, - I'll drive your slow fucking... - I fucking just told you... Yo, yo, yo, yo. Shut the fuck up! Both of you, yo! You drivin', Miracle, 'cause it's your fucking ride! It's an important-ass job, man! We need you on point. Let's do it exactly like he said. All right? New license plate. Velcro, on and off. Everybody cover up your tats. Wear your gloves. And when you waving your piece around, none of that sideways shit, nigga. Straight and tight. Dre, keep your head down, man. A'right? Don't look up. I got you. Here, man. Shit, you scary ass. We wearing hoodies and jeans. And don't bring your fucking dog, Junior. All right? It's one and done for us. Let's go over it again from the top. New license plate... Dre, keep your head down, man. I got you. $80,000. You know how many beats I could buy with that shit? This is one and done for us, you hear me? Our Father who art in Heaven... hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come... Thy will be done on Earth... as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation. Deliver us from evil. Thine is the kingdom and glory... Forever. Amen. Put your hands on the fucking counter. Don't touch no buttons, don't make no sounds. All right? Nod if you understand. I said nod if you fucking understand me. What he just fucking said. Shit! Come on, we gotta go. Come on, come on! Fuck! Shit. Come on! Get in the car! Shit! Get in the car! Come on! Missed them niggas. - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - Shit! Come on. Go, go! Oh, shit! - Fuck, go, go! - No way, we good. - Good? - Man! Oh, my God! You was doing drag racing shit there! Hey, baby. Baby, where you been at all day? I just wanted to do something... I just wanted to do something. My pa used to say, he used to tell me, you know, "Gotta keep my eye on you, 'cause if I blink, I'm gonna miss you." I want to be messing with my art, I want my... my drawings, I want my thoughts, I want them to be remembered, I wanted... I wanted to do something. Baby, what happened? He had the biggest smile on his face, D. Like he... He knew he made it, we all made it, we was... We was good. We... - Yo! - Holy shit, man! Yo, how much we get? Let's see, let's see. A stack of cash and chips, man. What you got? Fuck! Drive, nigga, drive! Fuck! Shit! - I got this! I got this! - Go! Go! I told y'all niggas, all you gotta do is believe in Tea-Z! - Tea-Z's gonna make it happen. - We lose them? Yeah, we got lost them niggas! I don't feel right, man. Fuck. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? - Shit! - Holy shit! We gonna fix you. We... Dre! Dre! Come on, man! No! You're gonna be okay, Dre. Hold it down or something, Junior, come on! He okay? That's a gunshot wound. Nah, it's a car accident. Hit and run. Really? Did you file a police report? This is a legitimate business I run. What are you boys tryin' to pull? Pastor, we ain't tryin' to pull anything. This nigga got... Do not use that word in front of me! - Uh-uh. Understand? - Yo. Yo. I don't know what you kids were into, and I don't wanna know. But unless you supply me with a notarized death certificate, not only can I cannot help you, but I'm going to have to ask y'all to leave. And take him with you. Give me the money. Reverend. Reverend Stewart. That brother of ours, he got a mama. He got a family. He got a brother and sister. A'right. I'm begging you to make it look right. I know you can. All right? I know it ain't a lot. I got $4,000 right here. Okay? Believe me when I tell you this is all we got. Please make this go away. It's gonna cost me a thousand just to get a death certificate. Well... You boys gonna have to dig a whole lot deeper in your pockets. Four thousand will barely even get you a cardboard box. You hear me? How's this for deep, motherfucker? Hm? You're gonna give my nigga the best casket you got in this bitch, or you gonna be in one beside him, motherfucker! You got that? Nigga! You can barely afford to bury one dead body. How you gonna bury two? Deal. We lost Andre. He didn't even wanna be there. Who is it? It's Junior! Oh, shit! Open up! Man, we got a problem. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You niggas can't cut the fucking line. We just coming in, we're gonna get our friend Miracle, okay? Oh, that crazy-ass nigga Tea-Z? A'right, 25 and y'all good. What you doing? What you thinking, man? - Let's go. - Let's go outside, man. Yo, you know how fucking hot these chips are right about now, nigga? Nigga, these chips are so fucking hot, it could get all of us sent straight to fucking jail. Unless Cousin kills us first. Dre just died, fool. The very same night your stupid ass is throwing money on hoes like you fucking cash money millionaire, nigga! You ain't the only one hurtin'. What the fuck does that mean? You don't think I loved Dre too? Huh? That was my dawg, just like it was yours. We all grew up together, nigga. You don't think I'm hurt? You mourn your way, nigga, I mourn mine. I know you mourn, bro. It's just that if you do, do you gotta go to strippers and champagne and stolen money? You wanna see all of us in a pine box? Fucked up, bro. Fucked up. - Hello? - Good morning. Is this Detective Lucinda Valencia? Who the hell is this? This is city councilman Jackson Simms. I've been told that you are newly in charge of Robbery. Congratulations. So what? Okay, you can check the tone. I wasn't always a city councilman. I'm a former deputy chief, NOPD. You understand me? I'll have your job in one phone call. So listen to me and the words I say to you now. The Fairgrounds Casino was hit. That is in my district. Apparently, four gang bangers walked in and got into a gunfight with some of our city's finest. Trouble is, I know the first responding officer, and he says by the time he arrived... the gun play was over. That no NOPD officers were involved. That means somebody's playing dress-up cop and walking into a perfectly good, taxpaying casino and shooting up the place. That can't happen. All right? Especially after Katrina. I'm trying to bring goodwill back, you understand? I'm trying to get investors to come in. And this kind of crime scares money away. And I want you to figure out what the fuck is going on! How much cash we got left? Twelve hundred. Fuck. Yo, Dwyer! Damn, son. There goes the Miracle Whip. Shit was getting too hot anyway, man. Well, we broke again. We still got those chips. I don't know, Miracle. It's a good trade-in. It's all right, man. All right. Let's be smart, lay low. Figure this shit out with Cousin tomorrow, all right? Shit ain't half bad. Detective Valencia. Yes, sir? David Wyland, casino day manager. Welcome. Take a seat, please. - Heck of a thing. - Yeah. Listen, I already spoke to detectives, gave my statement, Miss Valencia. I don't know exactly why I had to come all the way down here. I've got a ton of work to do. I understand, sir. But it's just a couple of questions, if you may. I mean, thankfully, nobody got hurt. Our pocketbooks did. Don't know exactly how much, but probably close to 150 grand. Cash or chips? Both. But either would do. We can't do a chip recall on that. Too expensive. But we will keep our eyes open. Red flag any peculiar cash-ins, case these kids come back. They were kids? Kids, the gunmen? Listen, detective, you know better than I. Could you please have your office send me all your employees list, former, present, anyone you may have contracted for security? And duplicate your surveillance tapes and send that on my way. I'd really appreciate that. Are we done here? We're done here. Mm. I'm impressed. I send you in for 100... you make out with 150. But it ain't true, Cousin. We left with about 25. - Huh? - You can't believe the papers. Know what I mean? You know, they inflating and get theirs. You heard me? I'm just... Now, forgive me if my sneaking suspicions start kicking in, but the first thing I think is how I know you ain't just deflating? We ain't deflating, Cousin. Our boy Dre got killed. We had to pay for his funeral. That's your business. You fucked up. Where's my money? We had about five. We got your chips. Hey, fuck these punk-ass chips, man. The paper say 150. You say 20. We meet in the middle, let's say 80. Even if I include these bitch-ass chips you brought here, that leaves 70. Where's my money? - We had the money. - Came out of nowhere... - We was good. - Son, we was good. We was on our way out. Then Dre got killed. We had to pay five grand to get Dre buried. Yo, stop talking to me about this dead man. Listen, man. Listen to me. You done spent the Wizard money on the Scarecrow funeral. And you interrupted my business, impeding on my profit. You 'bout to get yourself fucked up, right? Cousin, but, we got away, though. Shut your bitch-ass mouth, or I'm gonna shut it for you, permanently. We gonna get you your money, Cousin. A'right? We just need a little moment, a little time. We gonna get you your money, big dog, with interest. I get it. It's a negotiation. We negotiating. Fellas, let's show them how we negotiate. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa. Cousin, son. - We ain't even got... - Oh, yeah. I'm sure you already know how this works. You ain't got my money, you got to walk the plank. We gonna get you your money. With interest, ya heard me? - No exceptions. - We... we can all win here. Tugging at my heartstrings now. If I had one, you'd have it. Afraid everybody can't win on this one. You done already lost me, boy. Drop 'em. Drop 'em! Come on, son, we gonna do this. Get 'em, boy! Jun, get the car! Get the fuck out of here. Let me catch you somewhere else and kill you. We gotta go. You should have killed his ass, man. What the fuck we gonna do? Huh? He killed my fucking dog, man. - Hey, baby. - Demyra. A'right take Ike, go to your mom's, all right? - What? - Go to your mom's. Right now. What about Andre's funeral? Only funeral gonna be mines right now if I don't skip town. - I don't understand. - Just do it! Just do it. Tell me when you get there. Baby! We gotta figure some shit out, nigga. We gotta figure something out fast! O'Malley. How many casings did they find? Thirty-three. And nobody got hit? Nah, come on. Homeboys never learned how to hold a gun straight. They hit what they don't aim at. Can you do me a favor? Can you reach out to clinics, hospitals, vets? I don't give a shit if they treat farm animals. Can you just find if someone got patched up somewhere? Will do. Good morning. Peace, bro. All right, man. What's up, girlfight? You get lost looking for a yoga studio? No, I was just thinking more of a, of a fade. Maybe a number 15. Mm. Well, uh, the sign says appointments only. Oh, did someone read that to you? Hey, baby, go get you some ice cream, okay? Well? Cocaine's a hell of a drug, Detective. I know why you're here, a'right? This shit came with a tail, baby. Who jacked them? I don't know. "Don't know" don't cut it, cowboy. Listen, Courtney. You wanna keep on dancing, you better play me some music. You gonna have to be a cop on this one. You white folks don't like when locals robbin' a casino, you know what I mean? The motherfuckers fuckin' my money up. So before that happen, I let you know what I know. And vice versa. Good to see ya. I got 12 reasons why you might not wanna take another step! It's Blink. Your son, James. What you doing here? We need a place to stay for a few. You got trouble, boy? Yes, sir. Come on. That trouble ain't gonna follow you here, is it, boy? - Huh? - No. Morning. Man, it's about motherfucking time! This nigga tight. He needs some pussy. - Do you want his number? - Mm-hmm. Ooh! Is that Louise's? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look. I had a client. He came to the club the other night. He was in there tossing around chips that came from the casino that got robbed. But a couple of drinks later, he started boasting and things, talking about he knew the dudes that did it. Give me a name. Said his name was Teasy, something like that. Teasy. Yeah. A guy named Teasy, Yolanda, ain't a fucking lead. You're making me waste my time. Come on, Lucy, wait, look, I just... I figured maybe you might find him at the funeral. Fuck! Look it, look it, look it. Keep your hands up. Everything changes when you get hit. This here is for your... for your body. Black strap molasses, yohimbe, and sarsaparilla. Get it up you, drink up. Get the worms out you. Mr. Stewart? Lucinda Valencia, NOPD. I got some questions for you. So I hear I got a grandson, huh? He look like you? Yeah. He's a good kid. He's a lefty. Got a mama? Demyra's a queen. Oh, she a queen, huh? Hmm. Then what you doing out here? I got hit. It's tougher now. Yeah, of course it's tough. You black from the Lower Ninth. What's new? No, that's just an excuse. Oh, no, that's a fact of life. Look, I ain't here for no lecture, or... I just need a place to stay. Don't be prideful, James. You got a wife and a son now. You don't recognize what you up against. Can't run away from it. Ain't no ignoring it. You gonna have to deal with it. Pride is what do it to you. What, it was pride that make you not stay? It was pride made you leave? No. Kept me from coming back. Word of advice, huh? Don't leave your queen out there by herself. Somebody will come along, take her. Whoa, now. What's happenin', fam? Hey, Cousin. Missed you at the funeral. You for sure missed your husband and his little homies, right? What you lookin' for, huh? There ain't nothing for you here. Oh... Well, that's simple. I'm just lookin' for him. Well, then that makes three of us. He left two days ago, I ain't seen him since. So, you telling me you ain't got no idea? No. After all these years, you treat me like this? I wouldn't even much know we family, how you act. Now you do know everybody looking for him ain't trying to help him now, right? So tell me, where is he? Where a man from the Ninth Ward go who leave their wife and baby? To hell, mostly. I done told you he ain't here. We knee-deep in gasoline, you killin' people over matches. I ain't killed nobody yet, cousin. Besides, you know how it is out here. He who dies with the most matches wins the game, right? And understand, I don't much give no fuck about your little husband. But the little one's still my family. I feed my baby, Cousin. Hey, Demyra. Sometimes the devil you know beat the one you don't. We all know you, Cousin. You don't know somebody wants to snatch your little ass up. I've been thinking. That hit, where them cops come from? They just appear out of nowhere, as soon as we step out? They were dirty cops. There ain't no other type of cops. - They all dirty. - No, nigga. We shot at them. And the next day, no one turns up to turn anything out, ask questions? Come on, son, somebody leaked that shit. Ain't nobody from the Lower Ninth Ward turn on Cousin, bro. Maybe they ain't from the Lower Ninth. What are we gonna do? Huh? Just stay on the run till Cousin goes away? I'm serious, man. We survived more than Cousin our whole lives. Gettin' pushed out of our own home? Ain't nobody pushin' me out of my home. We gotta get him his money. With Cousin, it's all about that money. Y'all heard him say it himself. So what's to stop him from takin' our money and then killin' us afterwards? Exactly. Last time y'all talked to him didn't go too good. You almost lost your dick and your life, nigga. We gotta go over his head. Calliope? The Saint. There ain't but one nigga on this earth that scares me. And that's The Saint. That nigga fuck around and kill all of us, all of our family. Maybe. But we dead anyways. Look, I don't know about y'all, but I gotta see my family again. So The Saint could be our only option. What's the plan? Hands up! We want your motherfucking money! Get your fucking hands up now! Get the fuck up! Your fucking wallets, go! Put it in this fucking bag, let's go, let's go, let's go! Get your dumb ass to the fucking floor! Come on! The fuck in here! Let's go! Whoo! - Whoo! Yeah! - Let's go! Whoo! Shut the fuck up and put your hands on the fucking wall! Right now! Go! Turn around! Give me the fucking money! Didn't I tell you to go over there! Huh? Huh? Get your ass over there! Hurry up! Turn the fuck around! We got it, we got it, we got it, come on! Go! Go, go! James was the closest. I was sure they'd be at the funeral. But... you know how boys are. Do you have any idea where they might be, ma'am? You have any kids, officer? No, I don't. Your kids come with a special kind of GPS. You don't always know where they are, but you know where they are. And I know them boys as well as I know my Dre. And I think they in trouble. I hope they're not, Mrs. Hampton. Could you tell me where James lives? Police! You're under arrest. Put his black ass in the cage! Fuck you, white boy! Fuck you, homeboy! You heard me? Fucking woadies. Yes? I think I might have something for you, Lucy. I got a name from the kid's guest registry you gave me. The initial "C" Bass. Mean anything? Cousin Bass. Lower Ninth career thug. Gets rolled, nothing ever sticks. Why? Hmm. That's what I thought. 'Cause there's a Lorenzo Bass on the casino's payroll as well. We're lookin' for kids, Irish. Bass is almost 40. Sometimes casinos tap a local to check for its flaws in security. Now, if these flaws were big enough, maybe this guy Bass figured he'd exploit 'em. Sold them to these kids. Can I help you? Hi, councilman. My name's Demyra. I worked here when your wife was sick. Sent over by the hospice. Ella was a strong woman. Hey, Po'boy. Even the strength of God can't cure cancer. Still doesn't tell me why you're here. Well, I don't know where else to go. I need your help, something in the Ninth Ward. Something that involves my husband. Mm-hm. Starting to sound like something that... you should call the police about. I can't trust the police, sir. Here. Come on. There's a lot of councilmen. Why me? You know what it's like to lose a spouse. My husband ain't no criminal. Okay? He's in trouble. Now I'm in trouble. And so is our son. I'm gonna do whatever I can to protect them. You know, Miss Simms... Miss Simms always said you was different. Trying to be a better man. Oh, boy. You're about the same age she was when we met. She tell you how we met? No. She was at an intersection, and I did what you're not supposed to do. I... I gave her a ticket for being pretty. Thought I... thought I would charm her, you know. Well, I didn't know that she just passed the bar. And she's an attorney, right, so I thought we could flirt when she'd come to court, but the truth is it was already thrown out before I even got back to the precinct. The captain's chewing me out for abuse of power, all the things they teach in the academy. But I got her number. Now it's been two years. You said you believe in fresh starts. Right? Yeah. I need your help. Tell me what you know. You remember your lessons? Hm? 1927, Fordham, Mississippi? They found 40 tons of dynamite 15 miles from the French Quarter. Right at the levy. Yeah. No. What... what's the idea? You know the idea. The idea was to sacrifice the poor districts in the name of preserving the more fair aspects of our city. Hm? Only... only one judge was opposed to it. He said, "Gentlemen, what you have witnessed here today is the public execution of our fine parish." Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, completely decimated. But don't... don't worry about them anyway. The mosquitoes down there, they are so large, they can stand flatfooted and fuck a turkey. Engineer Corps covered it all up. Some mythical barge they talked about. Like a barge wouldn't go over the levy, it's gonna go through it.... Now the same thing is happening. 2005, the exact same thing. Different words, design flaw, engineering failure. None of it explains the dynamite they found, which they did find. Boom! It's gonna take a hundred years to find the proof. I'll have 80 proof right now. I know. Please stop, I know. I'll stop. Just not today. I mean, think about it, what were they gonna do, huh? Give up on the Garden District? Huh? Lose the French Quarter? It's not gonna happen. There's too much money. There's too much power. Yeah, right. Yeah. I wanna be some rogue councilman. Hm. Fighting corruption. Bullshit. The same corruption that paid for our house. Paid for our... our kids to go to private school. Your medical bills. I know. I know it's our district. I know people are crying. What'd you say? We can see further through our tears than through the lens of a telescope? I hear you. All I see right now, forgive the French, but it's the same shit in the same toilet getting flushed the same way. I'll come back tomorrow. I love you, Ella. Detective Valencia. What do you have for me? This turned into a murder case. - Uh-huh. - Kid killed, Andre Hampton. Yeah, trumpet player. I'm not sure how the pieces fit together. But it seems that Courtney's in bed with Cousin. - Cowboy Courtney? - Yeah. All right. Let me handle the big players. Listen to me, okay? What I need from you is to help these kids. Quite frankly, they're getting played. This is your chance, all right? You wanna protect and serve? Then protect and serve. Fucking Courtney. Ah! Damn! Nigga can't play on no empty stomach! Where's Boogie at with my order? I'm in here starving and shit. Oh, there goes my man. Okay. It's adding up. Nigga, I know you ain't eat some of my chicken, man. Man, this supposed to be a 12-piece combo, nigga. What the fuck, you think I can't count? Man, count this shit off, man. Shit, nigga. One, two, three, four... Oh! Get the fuck out here, nigga! Fucking with my fried chicken, man! Motherfucking crazy? Hey, that's assault, and it'll get you at least six months. I wanna see you in my office, Cowboy, right now. Lorenzo Bass. Hmm. You could have told me he was your CI. I could if I thought you needed to know. Well, what else did you forget to tell me? Hmm? Hey, it ain't always pretty, but it's always real, you dig? Cousin owes somebody a lot of money. That somebody happens to be The Saint. There's a war goin' on you don't know about. What'd you think they did with County before the storm? Huh? They let 'em all go. Everyone. Feds left. Now we got more criminals, more violence. Less intel, less cops. Now, we can deal with The Saint. But this Cousin, he outta control. So why don't you do something about it? Hmm? Why? It's time, money, and resources we don't have. So you leaked that shit and you got one of them boys killed. You rather I arrest him so he could spend the rest of his life in jail? They're out on the lam knocking off truck stops. They got the cops and two fucking warlords over them. Don't be pious with me, girl. Them niggas would shoot you in a crack-cocaine heartbeat. Man, get the fuck up on outta here and get back to your smash 'n' grabs, and let the real cops deal with this shit here. A'right? It's the real cops that make this shit happen. I'm bringing in the boys. Hey. Where you going? Now, who you think you are? Where you going, Lolita? Huh? You don't live around here. You think that badge protects you? I protect you! Any of those niggas would put a bullet in your ass if it wasn't for me! Yo, Pop, we back. This why you here? This why you came to see me? - No. It ain't about... - Oh, yes it is. I don't want your dope money. It ain't dope money. Whatever kind of money it is, I don't want it. And I don't want it in here. Why, 'cause it's more money than you made in your whole life? - Mmm. You fucking jealous. - Jealous? How many catfish you gotta catch in order to make this, Pop? This big boy money. Maybe if you caught more fish, you wouldn't have made so many mistakes. Maybe if you caught more fish, me and Ma's wouldn't be stuck in the Lower Ninth while you... I've made mistakes! Yeah! Uneducated! Prideful! That's what I was! You don't have to be that way! You got a son now. You got an opportunity! Look, it's too late for all that daddy talk, you hear me? You need to get out the house. Get out of here! Get outta my house! Take Jodeci and get out of here! You bringing trouble in my threshold of my house! Can someone tell Jackson I'm not gonna make it to lunch today? - Hello? - James? This is Lucinda Valencia, NOPD. - James, you there? - Yeah, I'm here. I'd like to talk to you, if that's okay. I'm not, uh... I'm not in town right now. I... I'm not sure... You'll meet me at the IC tonight. Dusk. Is that clear? Sorry about your boy. It wasn't us. I know you? You were a freshman at Tulane when I was a senior. I remember seeing your sketches on the school paper. I was an art minor myself. Well, this isn't a reunion, so... You and your boys been busy. My boys? Who you referring to? I'm not sure what you're talkin' about. You don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm here to tell you to stop. You're in trouble, James. On both sides of the line. And the feds... the feds want a new New Orleans. Feds do. Yeah, the feds do, and so do I. And so should you. A new New Orleans, or a new Lower Ninth? Both. A place where everybody can get jobs. Homes with running water and electricity. Banks. Grocery stores. Neighborhoods that's not ran by criminals. That's the New Orleans you referring to? You're a criminal, too, James. You ain't taking what's yours. What... what exactly am I taking? You're taking from the casinos. That's what you think. Okay. I'm caught up now. The casinos have been taking from us since we've been here. So you ask me, the new New Orleans is just like the old one. That one sucked too. I really loved your art, James. I really did. A pencil can take you a hell of a lot further than a gun. Well, not in the Lower Ninth. So... I'm working on a sketch of my own. And when I'm done with that... you're gonna see me again. Fuck you worried about three little niggas from the Ninth Ward for, huh? We find a body in the river every fucking week. Them little niggas fucking my business up. Yeah, well, money's a funny thing, right? Make any man feel like a king. Make a man feel like a slave also. What do I gotta do to get these boys home? Let me tell you. In 1813, governor of Louisiana offered a $500 reward for the capture of a outlaw pirate named Jean Lafitte. He was thinking of New Orleans. Now, Lafitte, the pirate, countered with a $5,000 reward for capture of the governor. Ain't nothing new about New Orleans, Jackson. No. We don't have to redefine New Orleans. All we have to do is redefine ourselves, which we can do. Look at the way you dress, look at the way you try to work people. Just remember I was there for the original sin, and to me, you are always gonna be a two-bit dope dealer. And you always gonna be a little dirty street cop who realize he can make more money wearing a suit than a uniform. I'll double it. Get those kids in. Still skimping on your campaign contributions, I see. Yeah.... Let me ask you this. That politician, that governor, or the pirate. Who lived longer? The pirate. Hey, yo, baby girl. Let me get two bottles for them niggas over there. Hey, yo, sweetheart, give them four bottles. A'right. Whoo! Yeah, this all my money right here. I see you, man. But this time brother gets what? We gonna roll, and this time we gonna really roll, bro. Oh, shit! Hope that don't break your pockets, my nigga. Yeah, son. Oh, shit! - Here! Yeah! - Let's go! Li'l bro, I hear you. Shit's the killin' fields. You know what I'm saying? All the weed done moved out to the suburbs. Chalmette, Pointe à la Hache. All you gotta do is pay out, you can move all the rock all you want. Just gotta deal with Talibans and the Vietnamese. Making it goddamn hard for a nigga to stay alive. Y'all Lower Ninth niggas lucky y'all shit's still underwater. What about The Saint? You think he can help? I don't know. Ask for yourself. Get up. Let's take a ride, little nigga. Do you boys know where you're actually from? This place... this place was founded by 800 of my ancestors. Les femmes du roi, the king's daughters. Their sole purpose was to attract male settlers, make fertile this here land. I left this place when I was a young man like yourselves. Desperately in search of the so-called American dream. Yet I never realized how much of a nightmare that dream must have been for most of you people. Now, I understand that your Ninth Ward privileges have... expired. Yes, sir. And you come here seeking asylum? We... we wanna go back. Back? Back to where most of you were born out of wedlock? Back where... half of you don't graduate from high school. And of that half... the males... are dead by the age of 20, or in jail. Have a seat. My God! You three little piggies have been busy. For your trouble. Thank you. Now please tell me, what in God's name has the Lower Ninth ever done for you? You've got a nice little chance to move on. You can move away. You got money. You got ambition. You definitely got talent. I know that 'cause y'all are survivors. So just answer one more question for me. Why do you want to go back? Because it's... it's our home. It was mine... long before it was yours. Would you mind if I... shared a Scripture with you? It's one of my favorite Scriptures. From the book of Ezekiel, chapter 3, verse 18. "If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die, ' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way in order for his life to be saved, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked and he does turn away from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life." Warning always comes before destruction. What was that? Boys, repeat after me Y'all know what that means? Click your heels. 'Cause there's no place like home. Run along now. There's no place like home. This right here, it's the church of my choice. Holy communion. Makes me remember all I'm grateful for. All the things you've taken. We've taken more than our share, that's true. Nathaniel, it's good to see you. They're calling you The Saint now? That makes me laugh. I like it. Just know your original sin, 'cause I was part of it. Is this your penance? I want it to be my absolution. I want to start over. I was hoping you could take what Katrina couldn't wash away. For every man... there's an appointed time to pay his debt. And for our friends, that time is now. And for you, I will do this. Do for your neighbor as your neighbor would do for you. I miss jazz. It's been gone away from New Orleans for quite some time now. Way back when Louis Armstrong moved to Queens, I guess. Sound of trumpets and trombones have been replaced by drum machines and turntables, the art of crooning supplanted by angry voices. Shit really makes sense, ya hear me? You know why all of these little niggas in the 3rd Ward holler "Callio"? I highly doubt they know. Calliope was the goddess of epic poetry. Lorenzo... we could've been great friends. Katrina could have... brought us together... instead of tearing our worlds apart. As romantic as that may sound... hell, no. We too much alike. Greedy-ass motherfuckers. That's why they can take all the opportunity away from us. They can flood us. Jail us. Even try to kill us. But they can never kill our greed. Oh, no. That's why we'll pimp, rap, sling dope, cheat or steal, even if it's from each other. Have you seen my altar? It'd be an honor. Do you believe in the gods? Well, I believe in God. A God. Now, while there may be others running round, tending the beat, maybe even us, there can only be one alpha dog. You think so? Is this the beautiful part of the story where you tell me that The Saint is going to introduce the demon to the god? I don't think He'll be where you're going. Ah, just as... Au revoir, my friend. Sorry to get you up at 5 a.m., ma'am. Talk to me. We got a call earlier, shots fired. Four bodies, no witnesses. A ton of stuff inside. Guns, casino chips. That's why we called you. Hey, yo, Perkins, you got that house good list for me, man? Hey. I told you it's a war going on out here, girl, and we treat it as such! Welcome back. I'm here to tell you the investigation's over. You're free to start again. You're getting a second chance. What do you think about that, hmm? James. I wanna know who broke this door. I did. That should cover it. Be good, James. You're home now, baby. Buried our brother... to get back to this? That's what we wanted, right? We wanted something more out of life. You know, I don't do this shit just to survive. I think we need to do this shit again. A'right, then. We gotta do this shit again. Shit, every fucking casino in Louisiana be ready for us. Nobody talkin' about no fuckin' casino. The money, it's in the back to the left over there. And we need to communicate... it's Ace, Deuce, and Tres. I need you ready to go. Three minutes, bro. Let's go. Get down! Don't fucking move! Put the fuckin' gun on the ground! - Get down! Hands up! - Okay, okay! Go! Crawl over there! Hurry up, bitch! Put the fuckin' gun on the ground! Slow! Crawl, bitch! Crawl! - Hurry up. - Go! This is a motherfucking robbery! Don't make it a homicide! - Open the fucking safe! - I don't have the combination! Open the fucking safe! Now, motherfucker! Yo, Ace! Tres! Tres! Keep your fuckin' heads down! Ace! How much we take? All of it. Grab all that shit, nigga. Shit! Get down! Get out! Everyone get the fuck out now! Go! Ace! Come on, nigga, come on! - Fuck! - Yes! Yo, look! - What the fuck? - It's on now! It's on! - Let's get the fuck out of here! - I got the money. Let's go! Fuck, man! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Fuck. What are we gonna do, Miracle? What the fuck do we do? Come out with your hands up! Fuck! Shit! Cover it up! Plug that shit up! Shit. Junior! Don't fuckin' die on me! Shit. Junior, come on. Gotta get outta here. Here's your money! I'm unarmed! Hold fire! At least three men attempted to rob a 7th Ward office this evening. Witnesses said a security guard gave his life while freeing several dozen hostages. The police and the perpetrators exchanged heavy gunfire. Two men are dead. Police don't know how many gunmen are left. Stand down! I said stand down! Who do you wanna see coming to Cut Throat City, James? You know, a lot of people think that Katrina was a disaster sent by God... to punish us for our sins. But if you ask me... Katrina's always been with us. Just had a bunch of different names. Would you believe me if I told you this one was inspired by you? It's beautiful. Listen, I... thank you for not finishing that sketch that you was working on. Well... you're the artist, not me. I told you a pencil was gonna take you way further than a gun. I'm really proud of you, Blink. Congratulations. Yeah, can I help you? I'm Demyra. This your grandson. Isaiah, say hi to your papa. Hi. Mmm. Wanna shake his hand? Oh. Okay. You got speed. We gon' work on that. All right. Mm-hmm. You know, water can give life, and water can take life. But all water has perfect memory, forever trying to return from where it once came. And that's home. Courtney. Hey. Councilor. Looking sharp. - You too, sir. - 'Ey, thank you. So, out of all the places in the New Orleans, why here? This family? No. No, this young man here, he got laid to rest thanks to your... Saint and Cousin rivalry. That's a piece of work right there. Isn't always pretty, but it's always real, ya hear? Yeah, yeah. Got my money? Yeah, I got your money. Count it up. You know, I saw this young man play no less than, uh... no less than eight times. Last time my wife saw him play, it was Mother's Day. - You know. - Hmm. She just started crying. I gotta be honest with you, though, man. I ain't bring tissues with me for your tears. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Do for your neighbor as your neighbor would do for you. No, it's do unto... All right, get over here. Ah, Jesus. Shit. 'Kay. All right. Yeah. All right. Hold this. Take the money. Put the weapon back in here. Yeah. Okay. I'm very sorry you had to see this, but hopefully you will be a more judicious overseer of our precinct, hmm. All right... then this man here. Would you, uh, take that, take that, take that. Thank you, yeah. Put it in the bag. All right. You're a smart man. You know what this is? This... is your balls. And my insurance. You understand me? The Saint doesn't think you have the character and the moral fortitude to hold down the Lower Ninth. Isn't that funny? A saint who doesn't believe in miracles? I do. Okay? I've been sleeping in my car since Katrina. You ain't gotta worry about the Lower Ninth. I'll hold it down real tight. Get your white ass out of here. That's for Dre.
