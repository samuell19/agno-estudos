NINO: What the hell you hollaring about? JOHNNY: Oh, come on. How does the man stay in? You know what? Forget about it. [interposing voices] MAN: You are a moax. You are a moax. MAN: I'm playing with my money. MAN: You know, I'm disgusted with the two of yous. I'll talk to yous later. Not for nothing, you know? MAN: You're good, kid. You're real good. But as long as I'm around, you'll always be second best. MAN: [inaudible], see? Yeah, Moses. Where's your Jesus now? MAN: What is that supposed to mean, [inaudible]? MAN: What? MAN: What is that?

MAN: Bada-boom, bada-bing. Bada-boom, bada-bing. MAN: First they come after you, then they come after me. MAN: I don't know. I don't frigging know. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] -Hey, you son of a bitch. You're dead. [shouting] -No. No. Not here. Not here. No. They don't know me. -Come on, Dory and Steve. Cut it out. You're scary the kids. It's not funny. [laughter] -[inaudible]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. -Can we sit them at the kids' table? -Definitely. -I'm sorry. -You're not sorry. -Oh, you know me too well. -Now, listen. You almost broke your neck. I hate it when you guys do that macho crap. -That was not macho crap. That was performance art. JOHNNY: Yeah, it was the living theater revisited. -Did you bring my spatula? -Yes, I did. And the cheese grater just like you asked. -Good. -Hi, honey. -Oh my god, Samantha in the kitchen. Call the paramedics. I'm about to have a stroke. -I'm cooking corn. -Quit picking on my wife. I love you, sweetheart. Hey, Hannah, come in here. -What? -Listen, I know you guys said no presents. But na, ah, ah, we could not resist. So because we love you so much, happy anniversary from Sam and I. -What? -What is it? -Oh, Dory. Dodger-Met tickets. Oh, you guys, this is going to be-- hey, kids. Look what Uncle Dory brought? -Now, see, I thought that no gifts meant no gifts. -Look what Uncle Dorian gave us. Box seats to the Dodger-Met game. You can bring Janie, too. -Cool. -Wow. Out of site. -Thanks, Uncle Dorian. -Thanks. -Far out. -Whoa, far out. You're welcome. Oh, far out. Out of site? They sound like little hippies. -Yeah. Well, they've been watching "Mod Squad" reruns back to back. -And speaking of mediocre TV, look who's here. -Oh my gosh. -Oh, sire. Your excellency. Maurice, I'm honored. I was sure I would get a call saying you were in Aspen skiing with Tom Cruise. -Honestly, I wouldn't miss this for the world. This is Catrice. She's in my new pilot. -Catrice. -Hi. -You wanted to meet actors, they're all here. Every gumba hit man, Jew lawyer, Irish mug you have ever seen on TV. This is an elephant graveyard of faces you cannot name. -Wow, thanks for the stereotyping, Maurice. Glad you don't fit into any pigeonhole yourself. You still driving a black Beamer? -Touche, you son of a bitch. -Oh, and speaking of stereotypes, you know Steve, and Armand, and Dorian? -Sure. -Hey. -Dorian. I saw that bit you did in the Pacino film. -Oh, yeah? -Saw the rough cut. Very nice. -Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. -Oh, that was you ? -Yeah, that was me. CATRICE: You were excellent. -Thank you. I'm Dorian. CATRICE: Dorian. -Look. Is that flirting? -I've seen you somewhere recently, haven't I? -Theater? -I mean, is he flirting right now or is he just being cordial? -Yeah. -I'd say he's just sucking up to a producer by any means necessary. -You know, Sam, I really can't tell because being married to Steve has sandpapered the flirt right out of me. -So where's your father? -Oh, yeah, my dad. Oh, yeah. Hey, Pop? Pop, look who's here, Maurice Melnick. -Who? -Maurice Melnick, the producer. Remember, he used you on his TV show? You played the old man on a stoop. -Soup? I didn't order any soup. JOHNNY: Like you said, he's one of a kind. Help yourselves. -Dorian. Catrice. -Did you hear that? He saw me in a rough cut. I got to call my agent. -What are you talking about? You had two lines in that movie. -It was a pivotal scene. The plot turned on it. -Oh, the plotted turned on, "I'm sorry Mr. Lee. I can't give you that information." -How do you know that? -I was up for the same part, remember? -Oh, that's right. I forgot. You would have been good. -Look at him. I've auditioned for him five times. Twice I had callbacks. He looked at me like he didn't even remember me. -What's that? What's that thing you're doing? That's an Italian thing, biting your knuckles. Jews don't bite their knuckles. Jews slap their foreheads. -Well, thank you for the tip, Dorian. But I am allowed to do Italian things, OK? -I'm trying to help you. -I'm married to an Italian. -Hey, hey, at least you read for him. He looked at me like I was a valet. I'm surprised he didn't throw me his keys. -Oh, screw him. Screw him. Everything he touches is schlock anyway. -Yeah. we don't do schlock. -That's right. -Do you believe that Maurice came? This is incredible. This means I got a real shot at that Paramount part. They still haven't made a choice. -John. Johnny, take it easy. You know he came for the food. He's the cheapest guy in town. -Yeah. You know they say that he stole an entire wheel of brie from Spielberg's house? -He's the one who stole Spielberg's brie? -Absolutely, it's him. -Come on. All I know, he's here and I can't be bad. We're talking about a featured part here with some real dimension. -Really? What is it this time? Cab driver or plumber? What, you going to stretch and go for the hit man, huh? -Come on, Armand. I'm serious. It's a lawyer. All right, a corrupt lawyer. But this character has got some depth, complexities, intelligence. Oh, Armand. Maybe this is my lucky day. Oh, look who's here. Theresa. Theresa. -Johnny. Hello, my baby. -Look at you, sweetheart. Oh, the party's complete. You look great. It's like the old days [inaudible]. -Hey, it's Theresa. -Hey, Armand. Your ex is here. She came to LA for the palimony suit. -Hello. JOHNNY: This is great, Theresa shows up. -You didn't even give me a call. -No, I was going to. I was going to, but I'm just here for a couple days. -You look great. Hey, come on over. I'll cook you a meal. Some fettuccine alfredo? -Oh, come on. Don't tempt me. -Oh, you can get away. -Hey, Theresa. -Hi. -Give me my boyfriend back. You had your chance with him a long time ago. -Yolanda, how have you been? -I'm great. -Hello. -Oh my god. -Hi, pal. [interposing voices] -Everybody. [interposing voices] [applause] -I'm going to finally have a real moment. 20 years of acting, I'm going to have a real moment. -Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. We're just thrilled you could be here with us on this special day. And remember, in lieu of gifts, we're asking you to make a donation to the Los Ninos Mission. -It wasn't my idea. [laughter] -As you know, they do great work with the disadvantaged children. And, oh, I just want to say, thank you. We love you all. -Aw. -Aw. [applause] -What can I say? I mean, if it weren't for Hannah here, I wouldn't be with great family and friends giving away gifts to strange children who will one day grow up and try to rob me. The truth is, I'm the luckiest guy on Earth. [applause] -Well, I don't know why political correctness has crept into casting. You can't even say like, I want a fat guy anymore. It's got to be like, I want a large person. Big human being. You know, big, expansive. But you just can't say, I need a fat guy who's 6 foot 10, right? -Oh, I hope we're like Hannah and Johnny on our 15th anniversary. Don't you? -Sure, babe. -Make love to me tonight. Will you, honey? -What's the matter, baby. You seem so sad. -I'm not sad. Just make love to me tonight. Will you? -This is what I'm talking about. We have these opportunities. Every once in a while, you got to crack them. Speak to him. -I know. I know. I should be more assertive. -And I said, no, no, no, no, no. It's not the Woody Allen film. So anyway, then he died. -You should. I talked to him when he came in, so just go. -I can't. You go first. -What? What's the matter? -Because I can't. I feel bloated. I ate chocolate. -Honey, will you listen to yourself? Listen to us. We're acting ridiculous. Let's just go. We're like normal people. -Let me hold your arm. -Can you tell my shirt is ripped? -No, just hold your arm down. I'll hold it. -Would you like a cup of coffee, Maurice? -Pretty please? -You got it. -This is like two coupling. Let me-- let me just-- -We are a-- Maurice, um-- really thought, um, "Breakneck" was, uh, just a terrific-- really terrific film. -Thank you. -Yeah, it was really terrific. It was really terrific. -Thank you very much. STEVE: What is with the whinnying? CATRICE: Oh, gosh. What, you want to pack a bag and go? -Hey. What's in the bag? -Oh, your wife said why not take something home when there's all this Parmesan. -Sure. Enjoy. So, uh, I guess we'll be in touch soon, huh? I mean, there's been no word on that Paramount part. -Paramount part? -Oh, come on. You know, the lawyer on your feature. -I'm going to kill that casting agent. -What? -Nobody called you? -No. -They were supposed to call you a week ago. We went another way. -Oh, I didn't know. -I feel like a complete putz. -Ah, what's the difference, huh? It's just another part. Who cares? Give me back my cheese though, you prick? -Oh, I'm so sorry. -So who'd they go with? -Oh, what difference does it make? Somebody else. -I know. I'm just curious. Who? -Rudy Ptak. -Oh, Rudy? Good. Uh, he's good-- good actor. -Think so? -Good choice, yeah. -Oh, good. I'm glad to hear you say that. -Yeah. -Takes a load off my mind. All right, see ya. -See ya, Maurice. [engine starting] -Rudy Ptak? Rudy Ptak. We're the same guy. He's me. They're using me, except I'm not getting paid. How the hell could this be happening, Hannah? I was right in the pocket with this role. I had it. -Honey, you're going to have to calm down. You'll make yourself sick. -No. No, I had this feeling this time. Like for once I was going to slip through. Do a character with some layers, with something more than a fourth-grade education. Instead, it's the same old shit. Second chooch from the left. -Now, come on. Quit putting yourself down. You are a success. CATRICE: Oh, Christ. Hannah, please. -You work more than those guys. -Not the glass is half full bit. Not this time, please. [sigh] Who am I kidding? The De Niros, the Pacinos, the Hoffmans. The [inaudible]. I'm just one of the ottomans hanging on a branch. [sigh] Screw them. I'm not going to let them get to me. I'm not. You're my little angel. [inaudible] -What happened, Daddy? You lose another part? -No, no. It's all right, honey. Go back to sleep, OK? Daddy loves you. Oh, god. I'm starved. And that prick took our Parmesan, too. $12 a pound. -Well, I said he could take it. -Why? -Because it's not good for you, but you can have some of that soy cheese I got at [inaudible]. -Soy cheese? [phone ringing] That's not cheese. That's spackle. You cover your walls with it. -Hello? Hi. How's it going? Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just a second. Johnny? -Oh, no. -It's Theresa. -Oh. -I don't know. -Oh. Hey. Hi, Theresa. -Hi, Johnny. Uh, party was great. Thanks. But listen. There's something I couldn't bring up with all those people in the room. But first, you gotta promise me-- and I mean, no bullshit, Johnny, that you won't tell a soul. This is the most hush-hush thing I've ever worked on, OK? My ass is on the line with this. -Theresa, I can keep a secret. What? -Oh, yeah? You're like a one-man wire service. You compete with CNN for God's sake. Now, promise me. -Yeah. All right. What is it? -Cross your heart and hope to die. -OK, cross my heart. -And hope to die. -And hope to die. For God's sake, now what is it? -Scorsese is doing "Capone." He's in from New York. He's seeing a few people. It's all very QT. And he asked me to help me out. Now, he saw you on "NYPD Blue" and he wants you to come in. He liked you. -He did? THERESA (ON PHONE): Yeah. He wants you to read. -For what? -For Capone, dummy. They want an unknown. De Niro can't do it because he already did Capone in "The Untouchables." It's wide open. But look, don't breathe a word, OK? Or else every punk actor in Hollywood who thinks he's the next Pacino or De Niro, which is most of your friends, will be all over us like flies on shit. And Marty doesn't want that, capisce? And especially don't tell Armand, OK? Because the last thing in the world I need is to offend him. Now, listen. If anyone asks you who's casting, say your agent got a call from the producer. -Yeah, OK. Theresa, I don't want to say. -Well, get prepared. Now, they're going to call you into Warner Brothers on Friday, and they're going to give you something to read then. -OK. OK. I got to ask you, is Rudy Ptak up for it? THERESA (ON PHONE): Rudy Ptak is on a series until April. Listen, Johnny, I want you to work. I want you to go deep, all right? -OK. THERESA (ON PHONE): OK? None of that TV gumba schtick. I mean, this is-- this is Scorsese, all right? Scorsese. OK? I mean, go-- go, go against your bigness. OK? I know you can do it. I saw you in "American Buffalo." I know you've got the range. I mean, you worked with Stella for god sake. OK? So don't embarrass me, all right? JOHNNY (ON PHONE): All right. Of course not. No. No, no, I won't let you down. I'll go deep, deep. -All right, go deep. Go deep, John. Deep is the word. Deep. Deep. JOHNNY (ON PHONE): You don't know how deep. -All right, Johnny. All right. Please. Now, work, work, work. -Thanks, Theresa. -[sigh]. -Hey, what's up? Johnny? Honey, what's wrong? -Oh. Oh. -Honey, what is it? What's wrong? Is it your heart? Just try to relax. Can you breathe? Just try to-- take-- what? Should I call 911? What? Are you all right? Please, just-- just try to take a breath. Honey, what? What is it? Tell me by a hand signal. What? What? -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. You bring me luck. You bring me luck. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you, Universe! -[gasp]. -Oh, god. Oh, god. Honey. Are you all right? -Oh. -What was it? Was it the "Grapes of Wrath" dream again? -Yes. -Oh, no. On the truck? -Maurice was there. He was chasing everybody. He was going to foreclose on the farm. I just-- I still couldn't talk to him. -Oh, god. Oh, honey. Honey. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. Come on. -Oh, honey, I-- -Come on. It's going to be OK. It's OK. It's over. It's all right. Ow. My hair. Ow. -I'm sorry. -It's all right. It's OK. It's going to be all right. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Yeah, it's all right. JOHNNY: Friday. I got to have this thing prepared by Friday. -Oh, honey, you have enough time. JOHNNY: Yeah. I have enough time if I'm doing "Baywatch." But for Scorsese? -OK. Come on, girls. Let's go. -Come on. And Theresa said go deep. She made a point of it, go deep. Did she mean that I have no depth, or did she mean find the depth of the character? -Honey, what are you talking about? You'll be fine, just treat it like any other audition. -Come on, mom. This could put Dad on the map. He'll finally stopped being pigeonholed as a small-time hit man or slob cab driver. -Thank you. Nice thing to say to your dad, Gabriella. -What? It's not the way I feel. It's just the way this business works. Right, Dad? -Right. Right. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Listen. While we're at it, not a word of any of this to your friends. They'll tell their fathers. And before you know it, there will be a damn stampede for this part. All right? -Don't worry, Dad. I never talk business with my friends. -Sounds like Pacino in "The Godfather." All right. GIRL: Hi, Janey. JANEY: Hi. -Hey. -Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. -Great party, you guys. I'm hungover and suicidal, but I really had a good time. -And they say she can't do comedy. -I love you, Johnny. OK. Does everyone have their lunch? Their homework? Their virtual reality pets? -All right. -Let's go. -Bye Janey. You know something? Gabriella's right. This is not like any other audition. I got to hit this one out of the park, hun. -OK. So instead of going to the track with Dorian or the golf course with Steve, why don't you really prepare on this one? Hm? -This is the LA library? I feel like I'm in Vegas. I'd like a room adjoining the casino, please. -Mm. -Johnny. -Dorian? -Hey. Johnny boy. How are you? What the hell are you doing in the library? -What are you doing in a library? -Babette, I'd like you meet a dear friend of mine. This is, uh, Johnny DiMartino, a wonderful actor. -Babette. -Babette's one of my students. I'm introducing her to Stanislavski. -Terrific guy. -Johnny studied with Stella, too. -Really? Wow. Oh, that must have been incredible. -Oh, yeah. The quest to unravel the mystery of subtext has become the metaphysical-- -Johnny's a riot, isn't he? Do you want to hang on a second? I'm just going to walk Babette out. It's all right, honey. I got to talk to this guy. -So, uh, you'll call me? -Yeah. Yeah. No, I'll call you. I'll stop by the restaurant. All right? I will. I promise. I said I promise. I'll see you. -Bye. -Bye. Johnny. -Jesus, Dorian. You're unbelievable. -Can you not say anything, please? Especially not to Hannah. You know how women are. They tell each other everything. -Oh, come on. What do you take me for? It's not my business. -Johnny, I can't help myself. She saw me in "The Crime Story." She starts asking me about acting. She's all over me. She wants to get together. That's why I came here. I didn't think I'd run into anybody at a library. What the hell are you doing here anyway? -An errand for Hannah. She needs them for a class. -Johnny, I'm cursed. Women love me. -My heart's breaking for you. -No, it's the truth. And the worst part of it is I love them right back. Did you look at her? -Yeah, young enough to be your daughter. -Exactly. Is that a curse or not? This is what wrecked my first marriage. Johnny, I thought it was Samantha. I thought, all right, I'm going to settle down. But I swear to god, on our wedding-- Johnny, I swear. This babe was with my cousin from Buffalo. She came onto me. I could have got laid at my own wedding. Johnny, I can't change. And now my marriage is coming apart. Samantha, I love her. I don't want to hurt her. -Jesus, Dorian. I had no idea things were this bad. You're really out of control here. You better go see a shrink or something. -I did. I did. I saw a shrink six months ago. A woman. -Yeah? -She starts asking me all about myself. One thing led to another. -No? -No, no, no. We just went-- we just went out to dinner. She took me to a nice place, too. Johnny, I'm freaking miserable. -But where do you get the energy for all this? -I don't know. I'm an actor. I got a lot of down time. I go to the gym. Of course, I meet women there, too. -Oh, Christ. You're insatiable. What gym is this? -Oh, god. You know, it's funny. I'm glad I ran into you. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for so long. It makes me see, you know, I got to stop this. Oh my god, what a day. You being here, too. That is weird, huh? Oh. What's Hannah got you bringing in to class? -No, no, no. -Come on. "Capone?" What's-- "Mr. Capone." What's Hannah doing with that? She teaches 19th Century poetry. -Beats the hell out of me. -You son of a bitch. -What? -That stuff's for you, isn't it? -Sort of. -So? So, why the big subterfuge? Come on, Johnny. I just got through spilling my guts out to you. Talk to me. We'll share secrets. -OK. OK. But you got to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone. Not a soul. -My lips are sealed. -Cross your heart and hope to die. -Jesus. -Say it. -Scorsese! Jesus. He's going to add a whole new dimension to Capone. Physically, you're perfect for it. -Why do you say that? You don't think I'm emotionally right for it? -No. You're going to be great. I'm saying, Theresa was right to bring you in. Let me tell you something, this is a feather in her cap, too. -Yeah. But you can't mention anything about her involvement with this. Especially to Armand. You know, the two of them were together once. -Don't even sweat it. It does not go beyond us. -Oh. -Hi, honey. What happened? Your audition was canceled. I didn't know where to reach you. -I know. I found out, uh, when I got there. Have you seen the, uh-- -So where have you been? -I was at the-- I was at the gym. Hey. -Well, I called Jenny and Steve and they didn't know where you were, so I was-- -I'm sorry, honey. I know. -All right. -I know. I'm sorry. Hey, Barbara, it's Dorian. Can you-- Dorian. Get me Harry. Well, just cut into his bullshit meeting. This is an emergency. Honey, could-- the-- the, uh, sound is-- Harry, listen. I want you to call Theresa Reynolds at the Argyle. She's doing a special casting session with Scorsese. He' is doing Al Capone and he wants an unknown to play Capone. No, I am telling you it's happening, Harry. I got it from Johnny DiMartino. But it's all very hush-hush. You cannot tell anybody how you heard about this. You can't. Now, Harry. I-- I am not street enough? Street my ass. I'm an actor and I'm Italian, too. What? So what if my family came from Florence? They had murderers in Florence, too, Harry. Listen. I am right for this part. I am calling in the chips on this one. Now, you call that bulimic bitch, Theresa. See if you can't get her head out of the toilet long enough for her to schedule me an appointment. Thank you. -Are you still there, Harry? Yes. No. That's my, uh-- it's not water running. I'm-- I'm in my car. I'm moving through Laurel Canyon. Dammit. How did you hear about this? Your daughter's dating a guy in the mail room at CAA? The place to meet future moguls? Great. You haven't told anyone, have you? Uh-huh. Yeah. Hey. I know you helped me out with the "Barney the Dinosaur Special," Harry. I haven't forgotten. Now, what do you want? Dorian. I know he's a lovely actor, but I mean-- no, I didn't know his father was Sicilian. -Harry, you are beautiful. You are beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, you didn't tell anybody how you heard about this, right? Great. 3:30 on Friday. Harry, I love you. I love you. You are the greatest. Yes. Yes. I'm in. -Well, that's just great. And what are you going to tell Johnny if he finds out? -He's not going to find out. We're going in at different times. -And what if you get the part? -Well, then I'll tell him my agent got me up for it, which is the truth almost. -You know what? I think it stinks. -What? -Johnny and Hannah are like family. She's one of my closest friends. -Honey, Johnny is like a brother to me. But this part doesn't have his name on it. And this is a chance to meet Scorsese. Scorsese. -(MOCKINGLY) Scorsese. -Hey, honey. -Hey. Hi. -Honey, would you give me that Phillips head? The pointy yellow one. -Oh. -How was the library? -OK, I guess. I got books. -Good. What'd you have for lunch? -I didn't eat. I wasn't hungry. What? Come on, what? -You got to promise not to tell, Hannah. You got to cross your heart and hope to die. -Please, what is it? -I ran into Dorian at the library. -Yeah? -He was with some gorgeous young bimbo. And believe me, they weren't there to read. -Oh, no. -And that's not all. He's been doing this kind of thing ever since they were married. He sounded like a one-man deflowering expedition. -Oh my god. Poor Samantha. -I know. I know. It's a mess, but you can't tell her. It's their marriage, for them to work out. -I feel terrible. What am I supposed to say when I see them? -Nothing. We care about both of them, right? We stay out of it. Even those he's being a major asshole. -I just don't believe it. -I know. I know. It's amazing. On the one day in maybe a decade that I decide to go into a library. Then I started thinking, maybe he's been put there for my work on Capone. You know, get into his evil soul, the lies, the betrayal. You know, maybe it's an omen. You know, work him a little. -Wait-- wait a minute. You're going to substitute Dorian for Capone? I mean, he's from Connecticut. His dad's an orthodontist. -I know. I know. That's my point. I'm trying to find Capone and I could end up doing an Italian Seinfeld. I'm losing my mind on this. And who the hell has got time to read? No, no, no. For this, I need a jolt int he guts. A direct connection to my Sicilian roots. Please, Hannah. I need a guy who kills, not a guy who naps. No, No. For this, I need to talk to a real mob guy. -Honey, you don't know any real mob guys. -I know. All these years playing hit men and I've been phoning it in. But you know, then it struck me. Maybe I do know somebody and he's right under my nose. -Who? -Armand, that's who. -Ha. Armand? -Of course. Come on, all that money. His mysterious family back East no one's ever seen. Plus, what's he known for? -I don't know, his salad dressing? -No. No, Scott Goldstein. His agent, remember? Scott never set him up for that terrorist role in "Die Hard 2." Armand flipped, punched him out, broke his jaw. -So? -So he did the one thing every actor's dreamed of doing but never had the balls to do. It was legendary. It was the only time Armand ever got mentioned in "Variety." On top of that, he's brilliant. -Theresa specifically said do not mention this to Armand. -No, no. She doesn't want him to know that she's involved, that's all. I'll tell him the producer has called me in directly. I have to talk to Armand. I have to. -Well, no. You got to go easy on those capers because you don't want them to overwhelm the taste of the salmon. Yeah. You got to go easy on the cream, too. [dog barking] -Hey, Java. Take it easy. It's all right, boy. It's Uncle Johnny. That a boy. You little Nazi prick. -What? It's not boned? You got to bone it. You don't want bones in the cream sauce. Hey, John. Johnny's here. All right, Steve. -Hey, I heard you. Two grown men sharing recipes. You banging him, too? Personally, he's not my type. I prefer guys with talent. -Capone? Incredible. And Scorsese? Wow. That's a tremendous opportunity. Jeez, so, uh, what's the problem, huh? -Well, you know, I'm pretty sure I got the big vicious thing down. You know, the cocky asshole. The flashy, over-the-top dresser. The ladies' man. -Oh, really? I think ladies' man would stump you completely. -Come on, Armand. Please. Come on. It's the other stuff. The deep, quiet thing. Those swirling Sicilian currents. That's what I need. -Swirling Sicilian currents? -Yeah. You know, like Pacino had in "The Godfather." Like Marlon has. You have it, too, Armand. -I do? -Oh, yeah. Something you carry with you. It's an intangible. -Well, thanks, Johnny. But you got it, too. Anybody has. -Nah. I went to Catholic school. I was an altar boy. I never looked death in the face. -What makes you think I did? -I don't know, a feeling. Armand, I-- I need something real. I need something as ancient and as Italian as-- as this clove of garlic here. -All right. All right. Hey. Hey, we'll start right there. -What? -You slice the garlic, you help me make a sauce, huh? What could be deeper than that? Here. -You serious? -Yeah. Come on, smell this. That's the power of your tradition, right? Come on, slice it up. Got to connect with the swirls, right? Connect with these swirls. -Ah. Ooh, I cut myself. -Hey, well, there you go. Hey, real blood, huh? Now we're talking. -Oh. What the hell? Am I out of my mind? I'm talking to a demented Wolfgang Puck here. -Hey, Johnny. Can you get me in to read? -What? -Well, you say I got Sicilian swirls. There's got to be other parts, right? Other Sicilian swirlers, right? -Ah, what a business. All right, Armand. I mean, if I get in the door, I'll see what I can do. Now, come on, Armand. I need your help. -All right, I'll tell you what I think. The guys with real balls, they never show it. The scariest guy I ever met, he looked like the grocer down the street. He blended in like your average Joe. But if you ever looked into his eyes, he didn't blink. It was like looking in to the eyes of a shark. They-- they were dead eyes. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. -Quiet and calm, dead eyes. -Right. Right. Dead eyes. -Right. All right, let's give it a shot. That's it. That's it. Feel it. Good. Good. Yeah. You know, your hair is perfect for this, Johnny. You're going to have to lose about 50 pounds, though. So is Rudy Ptak up for the role? -You had to mention his friggin name? -Hey, come on. Use your anger. That's it. You're doing it. [dog barking] [dog crying] -My life is like some weird cosmic test, you know? I haven't worked in a year and a half. You know, if God has given me all this talent, why doesn't he give me a way to use it? It's a curse. It's a punishment. -A punishment? For what? -I don't want to do this, OK? -No, look. I think-- why don't you try to go up for this Capone thing? -Because it's a secret thing, OK? And I-- I wouldn't cross Johnny. -You're an actor just like everyone else. Why shouldn't you go up for it? -Because I wouldn't do a thing like that, OK? End of story. [car honking] -Jo. You forget I needed the car? That audition's in 20 minutes. -No. I didn't forget. -You didn't? So what-- what happened? -Nothing. I'm sorry. -Jo? -Good luck. -Jo, don't do this to me, OK? What's happening? Will you tell me what's going on, please? -OK. I had to go to the bank. We bounced another check. -Oh, no. Who was it this time? We bounced a check on my mother? -Johnny DiMartino for the Casper's famous low-fat hot dog spot. This is my father. He comes with me. -Oh, right. You're on the list. -Hey, you're late. What the hell happened? -We got hung up. -OK. I'm going to need you right here, right in tight. And when I say action, then you go. I love the sweatshirt. It's a nice touch. -Thank you. -OK. And action. -Why are you breathing so hard? What's the matter with you? I just dropped two-thirds of my fat and half my calories. -Two-thirds of your fat and half your calories? That's wonderful, sir. -Um, Tony, right? JOHNNY: Johnny. -OK. The idea of doing it like Scarface is interesting, sort of. But this is an upstairs/downstairs thing. The bun is the schlepper who's been carrying the hot dog like forever. -Aha. -So you're-- yeah. So you're more of a swelled head poshon, dig? Think John Goodman in pink tights, but not too shitcky. We want a little Larry Sanders reality thing to it, too. You dig? -Not too shitcky. STEVE: What are you doing? -Hm? -What are you doing? -What? -That thing with your eyes. What are you doing? Stop it, Johnny. You're blowing this job for me. I need it. Snap out of it. -Oh, uh, sorry. Stevie. Hey, Trent. Trent, look. I'm sorry. I was trying something. It didn't work. Uh, Larry Sanders via the Flintstones but not too shticky. It's a beautiful concept, Trent. -Let's do it. -Very Spielbergian. -Thanks. Uh, Johnny, listen. Uh, the original idea was to go with an emaciated anorexic pickle. You know, Kate Moss and vinegar kind of thing. But pickles also come aged and wrinkled. And some of the clients have worked with your father before and thought that he might be right for the spot. -[snoring]. -Oh, god. -My father's a garbage man in New York for 40 years. He comes out to Hollywood. He's got a bigger career than me. -Yeah. Well, at least one of us is getting a damn callback. I hate your guts, Nino. -What? No. I had a salami sandwich before. -Salami? -Star material, no? -Yeah. Well, the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. -All right. All right, pops. Sit down. Come on, let's go. I got to get to practice. I got a lot of things to do today. -So what was that thing that, uh, you were doing before? -What thing? -That-- that weird thing with your eyes. -Oh, why? You like it? -I like it? Do I like it for what? -Hey, kids. We're here. Hi. -Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. -Daddy. -Hi, there. Hey, sweetie. -Can I be up first? -Yeah. Yeah. Go-- uh, give me a second. -OK. -Hey, Anthony. Twice around the bases on the double, all right? -You know, I spoke with Dorian earlier. And, uh, he asked me if I had talked to you. And I told him I hadn't. And he dropped it, like it wasn't important. Which made me think right away something was up. -Really? -Yeah, really. And now you start in with this weird eye thing. You want to tell me what the hell's going on or not? -Nothing. Nothing's going on. -15 years of acting class, you're still the worst liar on the planet. I'm hurt, man. Really. I am really hurt. And after you nearly blew that audition for me, too. -Hey. All right. Hold it. Hold it. Jesus. You're like Carl Sagan looking for a speck of dust in another solar system. All right, look. Look. If I tell you, you got to promise not to say a single word of this to anyone. Not-- -Hey. Hey. Who you talking to? It's me. It's Steve. -You got to promise not to get into the actor envy thing. Not on this one, please? -Oh, god. This one's really going to kill me, isn't it? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And Capone has never been done right. Never. Well, sure. Sure. Leave it-- leave it to Scorsese. I mean, look what he did with LaMotta. -Exactly. -Oh, man. I-- I am stoked. I'm inspired. You know why? -Why? -Because if this can happen for you, then anything is possible. Peaks and valleys. Life is peaks and valleys. That's what my shrink always said. And he was right. I-- I just happened to have been in a valley for a while. That's all. -More like the Great Canyon I'd say. -Yeah. Well, tell me about it. Anyway, the universe is smiling on you. It's time for gratitude. -You're right. You're right. -Now, look. If there's anything I can do, you need any kind of help, you call me. I'm there for you. You're going to have to fight your tendency to go over the top. -Over the top? I don't have a tendency to go over the top. -No. I just-- I mean, your bigness. -Oh. Oh. -You know, your larger-than-life persona. -Oh, yeah. But that works for the character. I just have to keep it reined in? -Yes. Exactly. Rein it in. Let it simmer. You let it percolate. And then, boom. You let it explode. -Exactly. Blow the fuckers right out of the water. -That's right. Hold on a second. Is Ptak up for it? -No. No, no. The door's wide open. I just have to walk right in. All right. All right. All right. Come on. All right, sweetheart. You remember. Watch the bat. Hit the ball. -I don't know. I just, um-- I just had to stop by, you see? And, uh, it's just you-- you know, you're like family. I mean, my real family. And, um-- -Hey, it's OK. -It's just-- -You can tell me. What is it? -It's just-- oh, Hannah. Dorian is going after that Capone part, after he promised Johnny he wouldn't do anything. -Oh, no. -Please don't tell Johnny. Please. Because if you do, it will end their friendship. Our friendship. But I want you to know I was against it. Oh, I'm so confused. I swear I feel more loyalty to you than I do to him. I'm all alone in this marriage, Han. I asked him if he was having an affair straight out like that and he said, no. You know, it's just all the career stress. All the craziness. -Yeah. -Oh, god. And I took my diaphragm out last month. -What? What? You-- -I threw it away. -You threw away your diaphragm? -I want to have a family, Han. Acting isn't my calling. I just get cast as bimbos, anyway. -I know that. But listen to me, having a baby is not going to solve your problems. -I know. But-- you know, we only made love eight times last month. We're married three years. Don't you think it's a little soon to be making love only eight times a month? -I should be so lucky. -Oh, I'm serious, Han. -Wait a minute. Does Dorian know that you threw out your diaphragm? -No. -No? -No. I want to be a mom, Han. -I know. -I want a baby. It's the only thing I feel really sure about. Everything else is so mixed up. -But Steve, you're Jewish. -Yeah. And the pope is Catholic. -You don't expect him to be bar mitvahed do you? -Look, Jo. All I know is that they are looking for an unknown. An unknown. Who in this town is more unknown than me? -No one. -Oh, ha, ha, ha. Look, this is Scorsese, OK? It's not some schlepper. He needs me. We are cut from the same stuff. -There's just one problem, Steve. You're not Italian. So what does that have to do with anything? What are you, a bigot? JOANNE: [gasp]. -Besides, you're Italian. Don't I get carry-over credit? I could do this part, Jo. Look at me. I'm perfect. I am perfect. Besides, I'll tell you something else. I am tougher than Johnny and all those other guys put together. You know, they're just getting by with their phony street bullshit, strutting around here like middle-aged Fonzies. These guys have made careers feeding stereotypes to idiot producers. But meanwhile, I am the real thing. A street guy who clawed his way up from nothing. I know what it's like to have somebody beat the crap out of me and look me right in the face and say, hey, Jew boy. Hey, Jew boy. -I'm sorry, but I'm not making the connection! -The connection is the rage. The bottomless, unending fury. That is who Capone is. That's who I am. I feel this part, Jo. It's my time. -And what about Johnny? He's your best friend. Hannah is my best friend. They're godparents to our daughter. -They don't have to know anything. -And what if Jupiter collides with Mars and you actually get this part? -Then I say mavel tov, bravo, and let the chips fall where they may. -It's a deal with the devil. -Well, sometimes when opportunity knocks, you got to grab it, baby. Maybe it's fate. I mean, look at Brando. You know, if he didn't have that trick knee, he would have ended up in World War II. We never would have heard of him. That one little quirk, that one little deformity that made all the difference. -Wait. Am I hearing you correctly? Are you now comparing yourself to Brando? -Yes. Yes, I am, dammit. I don't care. -Oh my-- -Jo, look. Listen to me. I am desperate. OK? I have to make something happen. It's either that or we go back to Newark and work in my uncle's carpet-cleaning business. -Newark? -Yes, Newark, Jo. Carpet cleaning in Newark, Jo. Newark. -OK, we deal with the devil. But how are you going to get in there? -Maybe it's finally time to call my cousin Max. -The proctologist? -No, Jo. The proctologist to the stars. He knows every asshole in town. MAX: So I take it you were pleased with the film even though the reviews were scathing? -Yeah. -Frankly, I thought you had a few second act problems. But hey, we can't be nominated for Academy Award every year, can we? No. Right. All right. Todd, hang on. You might feel a little discomfort here. -Whoa. Woo. -Yeah. Aren't you glad I didn't say it was going to hurt, huh? All right, we're almost done here. I promise. Oh, uh, Todd, you're tight with Marty Scorsese, aren't you? TODD: [grunting]. -Was that a yes or a no? Sorry. -Han. What are you doing here? -Pour me a scotch, will you? -A scotch? -Mm-hmm. -Han, what's up? -You're not going to believe this. But look, it's just got to stay between us, OK? JOANNE: Well, sure. -I found out that Dorian has been screwing around on Samantha throughout the entire marriage. -No. -Yes. Johnny caught him red-handed with a beautiful young actress. And Dorian begs him not to say anything to me because he's afraid I'm going to say something to Samantha, right? Then, Samantha comes over to the house all upset because she's afraid Dorian is having an affair. And I don't say anything. -Jesus. -Then, she tells me that Dorian is going up for this Al Capone part that Johnny is being brought in on by Martin Scorsese. I mean, Dorian is going in behind Johnny's back. Can you believe it? And please, don't say anything to Steve because it will just complicate things more, OK? Is this nuts or what? And Johnny, well, he won't stop eating. He had another shortness of breath episode the other night. I thought he was having a heart attack. I mean, I had to practically twist his arm to get him to agree to have a checkup. He's making me crazy. JOHNNY: What is this place? They have real doctors here? HANNAH: Yes, they do. -What are we doing? A field trip to the Cloisters over here, or what? I feel like a day player in Ghandi over here. I'm waiting for Ben Kingsley to show up. Come one. What are you serious or what over here? Look at this. We got Elsa, the she-wolf of the SS leading us through. -Johnny. -I don't know whether to genuflect or take a urine analysis. -Let's go. -All right. -Sorry. -Where's the holy water fount? -It was my pleasure, Johnny. You certainly are a big spirit. -Yeah. before you're through with me, I'm going to be a much smaller one, huh? -Yeah, but in weight only. -Come on, doc. You're an Italian. How do you resist the Parmesan cheese? -Moderation is the key, Johnny. Moderation. -Will moderation get me to look like you? -No. You know, I realize who you remind me of. One of my patients. A wonderful actor. I saw him a couple of days ago. Rudy Ptak. Do you know him? -Rudy Ptak is in LA? [phone ringing] -Hello? -Hi, Theresa. It's Johnny. -Oh, hi, Johnny. -Look, I got to ask you, is Rudy Ptak up for this part? -What, Ptak? No. I already told you, he's booked. -But he's here in LA and his show shoots in New York. -So, maybe he came to LA to pick up his mail? Johnny, you're obsessing. Stop. -I'm sorry, Theresa. I'm going a little nuts here. I won't let you down. I'll go deep. -OK? -Armand's on two. -[sigh]. Listen, honey. I'm sorry I can't make it. In fact, I'm booked on a flight to go back to New York today. -That's too bad. You know, you ought to give me a warning next time you come in. I really wanted to see you. Yolanda, too. -All right, I promise. -All right. Give your son my love, OK? -OK, sweetie. Bye. [sigh] Actors. -I just need to get street a little. Rough up, you know? -What's the part? -Just a mob guy, you know? But I want to give it some bite, you know? -It's Capone, isn't it? Johnny told me about it yesterday. -Oh, shit. Armand, please, you cannot say anything to him, all right? He'll kind of go crazy. What-- what am I supposed to do? My agent called me. Am I supposed to say no? -What is it about me everybody tells me their secrets? -Because you can keep a secret. Look, Armand. Since we're being completely honest, the reason I came here was because I thought you might have an inside track on this. -What the hell you talking about? -Well, you never talk about your past, you know? And so I started thinking that maybe your family was-- -What about my family? -Well, the-- they were, you know? -What? -Connected. -Connected? Where do you get this from? -Why-- I don't know. I just assumed. I mean, nobody's ever met them. -My family owns two car dealerships, which are totally legit. -I'm sorry, Armand. It's just that you don't work much and-- I mean, you don't have a job job. And you just-- you have a lot of money. -Dorian, I made a few good investments. Is there a law against that? -No, no. Absolutely not. No. I apologize. I'm out of line. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -This is unbelievable. I punch out my agent. You think I'd murdered somebody. If I'd actually murdered him, I'd probably have my own talk show by now. Or at least a movie of the week. Oh, god. It's unbelievable. And they call you some cushy middle-class poofta whose mother squeezed him orange juice every morning. -Exactly. See, you know. Armand, please. You got to help me. I would be indebted to you. -All right. Jeez. What are you going to do? So what do you want from me? -Anything. If you were directing me, what-- what would you tell me? ARMAND: Dorian, you got to understand. In Capone's world, it wasn't enough just to be brutally tough. You had to promote the idea, too. Capone was a strutter. He was a mug. I mean this wasn't because he was stupid. It's because he knew how to hold the power. They didn't have elections, so everybody he met was a potential threat. The strut and the mug let them know who was boss. -Oh, this is good. This is good. Do you mind if I just-- it helps me. No, this good. No, but I understand what you're talking about. It was a PR thing. A hype. ARMAND: No, it was not a hype. -No, no hype. Definitely not. No. -I mean, he-- you know, he could back it up. Remember, he was the general. -Right. Right. Like a loose cannon Patton or a Napoleon. This guy was Shakespearean. He was Dostoevsky. -Take it easy. What are you going to tell me, he was a great humanitarian? Remember, he was one level above-- above a reptile. Don't forget that. -Right. Right. That's even better. A strutting reptile. Oh, what an image. ARMAND: Yeah, go with that. Come on. Take it-- take it back a little bit. You know, in general. Put the arms to the side. Think it first. It's an attitude. It's an attitude first, and then it's something physical. Reptile. Cold-blooded. -Right. ARMAND: You're in control. Reptile. Dangerous. Everybody knows he's boss. He doesn't have to prove it. -Yeah. -All right, Dorian. That's good. All you got to do is sell that. -All right. [dog barking] [dog crying] -Yeah. -Honey? Maybe you should call Theresa. She's friends with Scorsese. Maybe she can help you with this audition. -She's on a plane back to New York. -Well, the plane's going to land eventually. -[sigh]. Why you getting on me? Why you pushing this? -Because you're sitting in the dark in the middle of the day, Armand. You're such a wonderful man. You're good at so many different things. You paint. You draw. You build things, you know? Maybe it's time for you to start-- -I'm an actor. That is my work. -Fine. -Oh, Yolanda. I'm sorry. Please, wait. Please. It's just that-- I-- I'm bugged by this. -I know what you're bugged by, believe me. Now, let me ask you this. Has it ever occurred to you once that maybe you have some responsibility in this? Maybe you are just not willing to do what it takes. You're incredible. Would it kill you to schmooze once in a while? Use a contact. For god sakes, you already slept with Theresa. Shouldn't that count for something? -Come on. -Oh, great. I'm getting laughs now. Maybe I should be an actor. We can both sit in the dark. Would you like that? You know, maybe we can do a sitcom together-- "Dim Sum Meets the Ravioli." Tune in next week, see what happen. -Yolanda, please. BABETTE (ON PHONE): Hello? -Hey. Babette, baby. How are you? You free? BABETTE (ON PHONE): Yeah, but I'm a mess. -Well, I don't care what you look like, I'm coming right over. BABETTE (ON PHONE): Oh, all right, baby. -OK. BABETTE (ON PHONE): Bye. JOHNNY (ON PHONE): Hi, it's Johnny and Hannah's. You know what to do. [beep] -Hey, Johnny. It's me. Listen, I got a last-minute looping session doing that Pacino picture. I don't even think I can make it today. I feel terrible. I'll call you later. -How come they have no OTV. In Los Angeles? A city like this needs OTV. -Pop, will you stop it? I'm trying to work here. -You're working too much. Let it be fresh. -Let it be fresh? You're turning into Lee Strasberg right before my eyes here. Dorian. -You talking to me? Me? I'm the only one here. [car honking] Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. She is so damn devious. -You, too, with this? You know, I am insulted. I am offended. Not to mention shocked. -Armand, I feel like an asshole, OK? I had no idea that Johnny was over here. And Dorian! That snake. That two-timing son of a-- oh my god. What am I saying? -Steve. Steve. Why are you doing this? Aren't you godfather to Johnny's kids, or he's godfather to yours? -Both. -Well? -I, I had to do it. I had to. I'm dying here, man. I'm dying. -Tell me about it. I haven't worked since the Bicentennial. -Yeah, but you've got someone to fall back on. -There you go again. A guy has a little bit of money and right away you think he's got it from Murder, Incorporated. -Well, where did you get your money? -Steve, it is none of your business. -You think Capone ever had a fruit salad? How is it? -It's good. JOHNNY: Ah, maybe I should have a bite. Why not? What could it be? What, 800, 900 calories? A couple of hundred grams of fat. -Hey, Johnny. Sorry I'm late. -Where the hell were you? -I got hung up. I tried to call you. -Were you with that Babette again? God, I've been having fantasies about her. Look at me, I'm feeling guilty about your affair. -Will you, please, Johnny, keep it down? -You hurt your wife, I splatter your brains all over that fancy Persian rug of yours. -Johnny, I told you, I'm sick about that. -Got ya. -What? -Armand gave this to me. I told you, the guy's brilliant. -Armand gave you that? Unbelievable. -And like we suspected, I think he's connected. -No. No, he owns two car dealerships. -Yeah, and the Corelone family was in the olive oil business. -Son of a bitch, you're right. -Well, why should you panic, Steve? A Jewish guy who looks like a rabbi going up for Capone. -Hey, Armand, I can do this role. I just-- I need a boost. An image. Something. -All right. All right. Now, no offense, but you're most comfortable as the dull neurotic. And you almost made a living playing guys like that. -Yeah, the key word is "almost." -Yeah, right. But dullness is a form of aggression. Your job is to get to the real aggression underneath. That's where you're going to find the real colors. The reds, the purples, the shocking greens. Think of it is as-- as opera. That's where these guys live. It's Pagliacci, Traviata, [inaudible]. All right? Now, can you go there? -Yes. How? -What do you think? Come here, Steve. Come here. Huh? -It's incredible. Thank you, man. -Hey. No problem. -This has got to stay between us, OK? -Sure. And I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life. -Hey, come on. Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on. Hey, what did I tell you about that? Huh? -He threw in fresh basil. -Oh, he cooked for you when he gave you the eyes? -Yeah. Yeah. Enough with the food, let's do some improvs here. -All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll put it on its feet. That always helps. -Mm, that's a good idea. Pop, we're going to walk. Stay here, all right? -All right, so what am I? -My henchman, of course. -Oh, that's good. That's good. Good. -Oh, I like that. That bounce, that thing. I got to use that. It's nice. Hey, you're a good actor, you prick. Remind me not to kill you. -Yeah, sure, boss. Whatever you say. -[inaudible]. Oh. Oh, Rocco. Want to take care of this? -You gentlemen care to step aside? -Maybe sometime this decade. -Come on. -Don't go too small. All right? I think your big comic impulses might be good for the character. -I don't get it. You think I should make him like more ha-ha funny? -No. No. Not ha-ha funny, but like, you know, weird funny. -Weird funny? -Don't complicate it. Just stop. Stop, stop. Hey, contain it. JOHNNY: Contain it? -Listen, Johnny. I got to go. -Go? No, no, no. No, you can't. Not now. -Didn't I tell you? -No. -I got the last-minute looping session on the Pacino thing. -You just got here. -Oh my god. -What? -Don't turn around. Those guys are following us. JOHNNY: Oh, Christ. Oh, let's go. Come on. Maybe I came on too strong before. -You? I gave my best Ray Liotta in "Angel Dust" look. That's the kind of thing you get killed for. -Come on, let's get my father and get out of here. DORIAN: Johnny, I wish I knew how to fight. I don't know how to fight, Johnny. I never did. Oh, God. Is this-- this is it. It's the end. Murdered at Venice Beach. It's like a bad movie of the week. God is punishing me. What are we going to do, Johnny? -Shit. What are we, mice or men? -What are you saying? -What do you-- what do you fucking guys want? You looking for trouble? -Whoa. Whoa, now. We don't want any trouble. Look. My name is Joey, and these are my friends, Paulie and Ralphie. -How you doing? -How you doing? -I'm doing good. -Good. -Now if you don't mind, I just want to talk to you for a minute. In private. -He's with me. -You want to be alone? All right. -OK. OK, now this may seem a little off the wall, but, uh, I'm in from Buffalo and I'm doing some research on, uh-- La Familia. You know, people of that ilk? Now, please, just stop me right now if I'm out of line. -No, no, no, continue. -Great. Anyway, when I saw you guys, I said, Jesus, this could be the real thing. So I'm just going to come right out and ask you, am I right? -Are you right? Is he right? -I don't know. Is he right? -Anything's possible. So what's this research for-- a magazine, newspaper article? what? -Actually, no. You see, I'm auditioning for this part tomorrow. Do you know the director Martin Scorsese? -This damn Theresa. What the hell, is every mug from here to Miami up for this part? -You-- you know Theresa? -Oh. -It's all right, Johnny. It's all right. Buffalo. Got an agent out here? JOEY: They got an office out here. -Would you-- what's the matter with you? -What? -What? -What? -I'm helping you. -What? -I'm helping you. [phone ringing] THERESA (ON PHONE): Hi, it's Theresa. You've reached Broadway Casting. You know the drill. [beep] JOHNNY: Come to Papa. -You are unbelievable, Johnny. -Garbage. Garbage. -It looks like a curse. -Come on, when it comes to poker, I'm Sinatra and you're Sonny Bono. -Yeah? Well, when it comes to acting, I'm De Niro and you are Desi Arnaz. -Please. It's more like I'm Pacino and you're Pat Sajak. -No. It's more like you're Costello and he is Abbott. And can we please pay cards? I'm down $80. -Oh. Hey, yeah, speaking of Italians, I was at Spago today. Scorsese was having lunch. Yeah, calamari in a marinara sauce. Wonder what he's doing in town. MAN: Hm. Come on, give me an ace. Ah, damn. -[inaudible]. -Not for nothing, but you know, I think Scorsese is the best there is. -Yeah, but he should stick with what he knows. Nobody does street guys like him. -Hey, did you fuck my wife? -That's a sick question. You're a sick fuck. I'm not going to answer that. -Did you fuck my wife? -I'm not going to answer that. MAN: Did you fuck my wife? DORIAN: I'm not going to answer it. I'm not going to answer that. -Did you fuck my wife? -I'm not going to answer that. -Stevie, what are they talking about? -It's a movie, Mom. It's just imitations. -I don't know, I heard some things. -What things you heard? -I hear some things. -What things? -I heard some things. -What things? -I hear some things. -What things? -Some things I heard. -What things? -You both are over the top in your manner than everything else. Because I am, without a doubt, the finest Italian American actor of my generation. -Danny Aiello. -You got it right, Estelle. -Well, goodbye, Susan. And I hope I never see you again. -Tony Curtis. [laughter] -You're a very funny man. -Funny how? -A very funny man. -What, like a clown? -No. You're a very funny man. -What, like I'm here for your amusement? -No, you're a very funny man. -What, like ha-ha funny? -No, you're funny like this funny. -I don't know, but I mean, it's amazing what one role can do. I mean, before "Raging Bull," Pesci. What, he was nothing. Now he's a big star. MAN: Did you fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? DORIAN: No, did you fuck my wife? BOTH: Did you fuck my wife? Did you fuck my wife? Did you fuck my wife? Are you talking to me? Did you fuck my wife? I don't know. -[inaudible]. And then Steve. And then, you know? And Dorian, too. It's a total farce. Total farce. And I do not want to leap into that insanity. -Then why are you helping them? -Oh, I don't know. They're my friends. -Ah. -Yo, am I scary? -Hm? -Am I a threat? No, they all think I'm connected, like some mob guy. -Are you connected, Armand? -What is this? You, too? -Well, you are oftly secretive. I mean, I've never even met your family. -Well, I-- you know, I hardly see them myself. -Is it because I'm Chinese? -I love that you're Chinese. I told you, my marriage ended when I became an actor and my family sided with my wife. End of story. -I got a phone call this morning. -Mm-hmm. -I got a job. -Hey, great. YOLANDA: In Seattle. -Seattle? -Yeah. I have to tell them by tomorrow if I want it. ARMAND: Tomorrow? YOLANDA: It's a really good graphic arts firm. I'm sorry to spring this on you like this, but I-- yeah, I have to make a decision. -I guess you do. -So, if you, uh, want me to stay, I'd like that very much. But I'm going to need more. -See, I'm thinking the mug, but I start with a walk. And then I make it a strut. And then I add a little bounce. But then-- this is key-- I bring it down. I bring it down. And down. Then all of a sudden-- boom, I'm letting the whole world know-- don't fuck with me. -It's working. -It is, isn't it? I know. I can-- I can feel it. God. Oh, Sam. I just-- I love-- I love acting. What? What? -You are so good and so pretty. You're even prettier than me. -Do you really think so? -Yeah. -I love you. I love you. -All right, get in the kitchen and make me a snack! -No, now you're whining. Don't complain in the scream. Threaten me with it. God knows you have enough anger to start World War III. -What the hell is that supposed to mean, Jo? -Oh, that's it. The scumbag prick in person. -Yeah, but that's just mean. -Exactly. -I just-- I need something else. You know, it needs-- it needs. I got to have the right prop or something. I know what I need. Silk boxer shorts. De Niro wore them in "The Untouchables." -You don't have silk boxer shorts. -Get me a pair of your babydolls. -Steve. -Your babydolls, Jo. -They're not going to fit you. -Jo, just do it. Don't make a face. Help me. All right? I'm asking for help. -Why don't you just try acting. Acting. -I am acting. -What a concept. -Acting consists of a lot of things, honey. -Do you want the pink ones or the red ones? -Try the red ones, Daddy. They're more masculine. -Honey. -All right. Marching back to bed. Marching down the hallway. Turning off the light. Under the covers. -Ugh. -I love you. Bye. [door closing] -Yeah. This feels like something. This is good. This is good. This is good, honey. What do you think? Huh? -Steve. -What do you think? It's not Steve. It's Al. Al. And if you're nice to me, later I'll show you my scars. Muah. -Oh. -Yeah. Yeah, baby. This is a start of something. Yeah, baby. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? This will work. This will work. Oh, god. -Janey's bird pot. -I, I got carried away. -What happened? -Nothing, honey. -Mommy, what's wrong? -We got-- it was an accident. -Oh, Steve. Oh. -An acting accident. -Oh, god. -Sweetheart, I'm sorry. -You know, it's times like this that you really have to admit to yourself that you have a dream. That maybe you're just like every other fool who came to this town. -You're not l everybody else. -What do you dream about, Daddy? -Hey, girls. What are you doing up? -I'm thirsty. -Oh, come here. Poor baby. -I can't see any stars, Daddy. There's too much smog. -No, no, no, look. Look, look. See over there in the West? Venus. That's Venus, see? See that big thing there that looks like a star? That's Venus. -Cool. You'll be great tomorrow, Dad. Don't worry. HANNAH: And no more rehearsing. Take the morning off. -Guys, nine holes on me. I insist. A little gift to show how much I love you. ARMAND: Thanks, Johnny. That's very big of you. -Johnny. -What? -Your audition is this afternoon. Do you think this is the best idea? -Yeah. Yeah. That's this afternoon, but this morning I want to relax and play some golf with my friends. Screw it. Look who I'm talking to, the three extras from "The Piano." Will you guys tattoo some smiles on those faces? STEVE: Absolutely. Nice. DORIAN: Very nice. ARMAND: Must be your lucky day. STEVE: No, you go. You go second. I don't like going second. DORIAN: You always go second. STEVE: And I always hate it. Will you please just go today? DORIAN: Why are you telling me this now. You've always gone second. Go second. STEVE: General, I'm just tired of you telling me what to do all the time, OK? DORIAN: OK. I won't tell you. Just go second. -Johnny? Johnny, where you going? DORIAN: Johnny. -Johnny, what are you doing? -Rudy Ptak. You son of a bitch. -Johnny. How the hell are you doing? Jeez, I look in your face. It's like-- like looking in a mirror. We're incredibly handsome. -Yeah. Yeah. We look like a couple of bouncers at a teamsters convention. -Ha-ha. This is my agent here, Sean Nusbalm. -Yeah, hi. -So, uh-- hey, congratulations. I heard you got a TV series in New York. -Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, just a little bit of luck. -Yeah. So what are you doing out here? -I'm auditioning. It's just some thing, you know? -Yeah, I know. It's Capone, isn't it? -It's not your business what roles I go up for, John. -Not my business? Every time I turn around, you're in my face. What do you got, somebody telling you what I'm going up for, huh? Are you clocking me? -What's he nuts or something? What's he doing here? -Oh, no, no. That's it. No. He's got somebody tipping him off. That's it, right? -Johnny. -Right? Really. Who is it, a friend? This guy? -Maybe he's, uh-- maybe he's just a better actor than you. -Oh, hey. -Oh, really? Oh, look, the suit talks. What are you drinking here, pal? Some actor's blood? -You're way off-base here. Now, back off before something happens. Back off. -Ooh, tough guy, huh? Oh, good anger, Rudy. The trouble is I'm not scared. You're not going deep enough. -Yeah. You're going to tell me about deeper. Mr. Over-the-Top himself? -Over the top? -Hey. -Hey. hey. -Hey, Johnny. -Johnny. [interposing voices] -No biting. -Hey, hey, hey. -Calm down. -Stop it. Look at what you're-- [interposing voices] RUDY: I think he bit my ear. -Jesus. God, Rudy. I, I lost it. I don't know what got into me. Rudy, I'm-- RUDY: You're a maniac. -Hey. -It's all right. -You know how many roles-- you took just as many roles from me as I took from you. -I did? -Yes, you did. The cabby in "Baywatch." And-- and there was that-- the stalker in the Lizzy Wagner movie. No, maybe it was a gynecologist. The point is, everywhere I look, I see your face, too. JOHNNY: Rudy. All right, Rudy. I'm sorry, Rudy. I don't know what it is. It's just this part, man. It's got me crazy. -All right, all right, all right. -All right? -I know. -All right. -I heard there's only a few of us up for it, but the new word I hear is that the list is growing. -Yeah. Your pals are on the list, too. -Oh my god. -I have no idea what he's talking about. SEAN: What do you mean? I saw your names myself. Both of you have appointments this afternoon. -Johnny. My agent got me up for it. I swear to god I was going to tell you. -Johnny. Johnny, I-- DORIAN: I'm sorry. -I have always wanted to meet Scorsese. This was a golden opportunity for me. I-- I'm very sorry. Hey. Johnny. What the hell? Johnny. -Johnny. [interposing voices] -Somebody call a doctor. -He's turning blue! -Doctor! -Hey, do something. -I'm out of the service area! -Where do you hit him? -Where the heart is? DORIAN: Call a doctor. [phone ringing] -Hello. Hi. What? -I don't care what it took to set it up, Harry. Cancel the damn addition. No, you're not hearing me. Do it. -I should go to hell for all eternity. I almost wish I believed in that stuff. -Oh, it's OK. I'll go for both of us. Hannah, I should have told you. I'm-- -Will you stop, both of you, please? You're not responsible for this. He is. And I am. All those years of cream sauces and Caesar salads. And cheesecake and cannolis. And Thai dumplings. -Oh, Han. Don't do this to yourself. -Oh my god. I'm starving. -Hi, honey. -The audition. What time is it? -Johnny, please. Sit back down. You're not going anywhere. You're sick. STEVE: That's his voice. I hear his voice. -Jesus, Hannah. What happened? What? -Just take it easy. STEVE: I got to talk to him. Johnny. Johnny. Thank god you're all right. I'm so sorry. I didn't want to hurt you, buddy. -Johnny, thank god. I wanted to die myself after what I did. -What is this? Am I dying? -No, no. -Jeez, Hannah. What's happening? What's going on? -It's OK. Now, listen to me. They took a lot of tests. They're still not quite sure. They think you had a mild heart attack. -Oh, [speaking italian]. -It could have been a lot worse. You are still here. That's all that matters. -Oh, Hannah. It happened. It finally happened. -Honey, it's going to be OK. I know it. I do. -The kids, do they know? -No. They're still at school. -And Pop? -Went to the track. He's not home yet. -Oh, Jesus. -Johnny, we canceled the audition. We don't want to go to any auditions without you. -Buddy, I got bit by the envy monster. It consumed me. -You too? You should have just told me, that's all. You're my best friends. My family. What's happening to us? And for what? For fame? Fortune? Are we willing to throw away everything for it? Maybe that's just the way it's supposed to be. Nothing more. But in the end, my kids will remember me as the hit man on "NYPD Blue." -Oh, sweetheart. -No. -Johnny. -No, Johnny. -No. Johnny, no, no, no. Johnny. -You're just tired. You'll be fine. -Oh. -Excuse me. We've had quite a day, haven't we? -[inaudible]. -You'll have to excuse us now. -Well, that's it. I'm quitting acting. I'm getting the hell out. -What about me? I actually tried to sabotage his performance. I'm out of control. My whole life is a sham. -Your whole life? What are you talking about? -Oh, nothing, honey. I'm just nuts. -Look, I, uh-- I know we got a lot of stuff to talk about. But this happened and-- -No, that's OK. Listen, I've made a decision. I've decided to take the job in Seattle. It will be a good change. And you and I will have time apart to think things through. -Wait a second. When did you decide this? Don't I have anything to say about this? -Of course. Say anything you want. -Um-- HANNAH: No! What are you-- JOHNNY: Get these things off me. HANNAH: You cannot do that. Stop. -It was gas. Gas. From the burrito I ate this morning. It mimicked a heart attack. Where are my clothes? Where are my clothes? -Will you just listen-- -No, there's time. There's time. no. Gas. Gas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you're all forgiven, you bunch of shits. Now, where's [inaudible]? I need my clothes. -Johnny. -Johnny. HANNAH: Stop it. Stop running. -Oh, food. Thank you. Thank you. -Give me that. -Life is precious. Hang in there, pal. -Honey. You're coming off a sedative. You're not yourself. -I've never been more myself. Don't you see, sweetheart, how beautiful everything is. The universe wants me at this audition. -Great. He's going holy on us. -It's a miracle. - --perfect Capone. Harry, Harry, it's Dorian. Listen. Dorian. Look, did you cancel the audition, Harry? Good, because I'm going in after all. -You snake. After everything we've been through, you're still going in on that audition? -Fucking A I'm going in. It was-- it was an accident. It was a false alarm. He forgave us, didn't he? You should go back in, too. You son of a bitch, you didn't cancel, did you? -I couldn't cancel it. -What the-- -My cousin got me the audition. -What the hell was going to be the criteria? A coma, you go in? A death, you cancel? What? I'll kill you. You broke my cellphone. JOHNNY: Look at this day. What a beautiful day. Where's that car? I love that car. -Listen to me, if we are going to do this, I'm driving. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love you. I love you. I love you. -Johnny, listen. Did you mean what you said? You forgive us? -Stevie, my tortured friend. I wish you could love yourself the way others love you. The world would be your oyster. And Dorian, my deceiving, guilt-ridden pal, cherish this moment. Give her babies. -All right, Johnny. OK. And Armand, you. You have more character in your pinkie than most men have in their entire mind. You knew it all, didn't you? Dorian and Steve going for the part, Theresa running the audition, and still you remained loyal? -You're my hero, Armand. -Break a leg, Johnny. -All right. -Knock them dead. -Thank you. Thank you. -Bye. -Good luck, buddy. -Bye. -All right. -Why did Johnny say you were deceiving and guilt-ridden? -Armand, what is it? -My Theresa handled the audition. -Hey, Tommy. You help me and I help you. Two neighborhood guys make good, gumba and a mick. But now you want to get elected again, put some distance between us. Hey, I understand. I know the game. But this, calling me names in public, saying bad things about my people when we get you in office. Hey, I know it's an act, huh? Put on a little show. What the hell? I'm the bad guy. You're the good guy. Put a little distance between us. But you show me respect. If you don't, I'll kill your whole fucking family. Blow their brains all over the sidewalk. I'll start with that pretty, little wife of yours. Hey, I know, pal. I'm just protecting my own. So now we understand each other. You play your part, I play mine. And we'll all be out there with bells on. I promise. I'll see ya after the election. Oh, and give my regards to Evelyn and the kids. -Good, Johnny. Great. Very good. Very good. Very, very good. Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. THERESA: Thank you, Johnny. -That was pretty good, you know? -Mm-hmm. -Hey, I-- I know it's an act. We all got to put on a show. What the hell? You're the god guy and I'm the bad guy. And you want to put some distance between us. But you show me some respect. If you don't, I'll kill your whole fucking family. I'll blow their brains out all over the sidewalk. I'll start with that pretty, little wife of yours. Pal, I am just looking after my own. OK? So now we understand each other. You do your part, I'll do mine. And we'll be there with bells on. Promise. I'll talk to you after the election. Regards to Evelyn and the kids. -Good. It's really good, Steve. Thanks. It's really-- it's good. Very good. That was good. THERESA: Mm-hmm. -Thank you, Steve. THERESA: Yeah, thank you, Steve. -What the hell? I'm the bad guy and you're the good guy. Sure, put some distance between us. But show me respect. If you don't, I'll kill your whole fucking family. I will blow their brains out all over the sidewalk. And I will start with that pretty wife of yours. Hey, I know, pal. I'm just protecting my own, too. OK, so now we understand each other. You play your part, I play mine. And we will both be out there with bells on, promise. I will talk to you after the election. Give my regards to Evelyn and the kids. -Good, Dorian. Very good. Very good. THERESA: Yeah. Oh, yeah. -Excellent. Excellent. -Thank you. Thank you. You-- you want to go another way? We could try a little, uh, something-- -No, no, no. That was-- that was fine. It was great. -OK. Thank you. I-- I'm a big-- thanks. -Yeah. -Thank you. -Uh, other way. -Thanks. Um, do you validate for parking? -Um, I don't know. Do we validate or what? THERESA: I don't know. -Ask the kid. There's a kid outside, ask him. -All right. I'll ask. -Did you feel good about that note I gave you? -It was so right on. -It was? -Yeah. Because-- -That felt good. You did well, huh? -Yeah. You? -Yeah. It was OK. It was OK. -Wild, huh? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. -How you guys doing? -Hey, Rudy. What do you say? Rudy, my wife, Hannah. Rudy Ptak. -How you doing? -So how'd it go? -It was, uh, good. I-- I think. You? -Uh. -Are you-- are you feeling all right? -Yeah. You? -Yeah. No business like show business. Take care of yourself, Johnny. See you around. JOHNNY: You too, Rudy. -Dorian. -Babette. -Hi, babe. -Hey. What-- what are you doing here? -I'm reading for Scorsese. My agent got me in. -That's great. That's great. Babette, this is my, um, wife, Samantha. Sam, this is Babette from the Victory Boulevard Playhouse. We did the Mamet Showcase together. -Really? Um, what play? -"Death Trap." -"American Buffalo." -"Glengarry." -"Streamers." Well, bye. -What? Honey, she's an old friend. We work together. She-- she's an actress. She's overly demonstrative. ARMAND: Where's Therese? ASSISTANT: What are you doing? Who are you? ARMAND: Don't worry about it. It's not your concern. Now, where is she? -No, you don't have an appointment. -Armand? ASSISTANT: She can't be disturbed. She's in a session. -Yeah, she's going to be disturbed. -Armand? ASSISTANT: Wait a minute. Listen. -Armand. ASSISTANT: I told you, you can't go in there. I'm sorry, this maniac just barged in. I didn't-- -Armand. -What are you doing? ASSISTANT: I told him he couldn't come in. -Everybody, back off. -Oh my god. -Everybody just back off. Back away. MAN: What's going on here? -Come on. Come on, we got a private audition. -How would you like a private ass-kicking? -Whoa. Hey. -Armand. -Hey, I'm auditioning here. -Your audition is over, friend. Sit down. JOHNNY: Armand, what are you doing? -Don't call me that. That's not my name anymore. I am finished with all that. Everybody, sit down. You do not want to make that call. WOMAN: Sit down. Do what he says, please. -OK, OK. Whatever your name is, what's in the suitcase, pal? -None of your business, pal. Everybody just sit down. Hey. What did I just tell you, sit down and stay put. All of yous. Look at you, think you're so smart with your slick, show biz lives, spitting out one lie after another. Give me that chair. You have any idea what it's like to be typecast your whole life, huh? To have people smile in your face, but behind your back whisper, oh, watch out for him? You know who his family is? Or what it's like to be a kid and elicit fear from grown people? A kid does not want to be feared. He wants to be loved. But fear is what you grow up with. It's the air you breathe. And soon, you cultivate that fear. You learn to look someone in the eyes and just make them shake. It's pathetic. Those whispers still hurt. Smiles and whispers. Smiles and whispers. You know it splits you right in half. You walk around with-- with stitches going down right the center of your body. But then you discover that there are people in this world who have it every which way. Yeah, they play all the roles. And they are loved for it because they are our magicians. They are our sorcerers. And then you start to think, hey, I could do that because I understand both sides. I am both sides. So destiny takes a little turn, it breaks the chain, and then you leave your family and you venture out into this big, new world. Now, this is a very special world. It's got big dreams in it, hm? You had those dreams, right? You almost tasted the glory that awaits you. But it's never the right day. It's never the right moment. And it's never the right part. And then you realize that it's a punishment for all the bad things you did in your other life. We lived together. I was godfather to your son. -Armand, I didn't want to hurt you. -Well, this is a lie. You are all liars. And I-- yeah, I am a fool because I am a traitor to my family. But I have learned my lesson very well. This son is going to return to his family with pride and ferocity and a gesture that will make my father proud. Hey, you. Will you sit down? I relish this moment because in this moment I reclaim my father's respect and I make myself whole again in the eyes of god and the devil. And Dad, [speaking italian]. May this fuse us in our ancestral glory. Yeah, Dad. Let's show them what they fear the most. [screaming] -Oh, god. -Huh? -I'm available. All you got to do is call my agent, 555-1635. -You mean you're not that guy? -No, I'm not that guy. And, uh, my father's a Toyota dealer. -Oh. -It's the truth. Nobody believes me. -OK. -Crazy actors. You're going to hear from my lawyer, you little prick. -Jesus Christ, you need therapy. -Honey. -I want a divorce. -Jesus, are you out of your mind? Have you lost it completely? -No, I just want to know why you didn't call me in. -What? -Theresa, why did you pass me over? You're one of my oldest friends in the world. Just say it, will you? Just once. Right to my face. Why didn't you call me in? -Because you weren't right for the part. OK, let's hear it for Yolanda and Armand. May you share joy and happiness for the rest of your lives. [applause] -Salud. -Well, uh, I got to say being here with, uh, my lovely, uh-- my lovely, ooh-- my lovely wife. And all of you makes me feel like for the first time maybe in my whole life I am right where I ought to be. [applause] -And, um, to all of our great friends, some of whom invested in this very restaurant, that my husband-- oh my god, I can't believe I'm saying that. My own personal husband is the proud owner of. Thank you, guys. [applause] -Dad. Can I call you dad? -I'd love you to call me dad. -At last we meet the mysterious family. -We're so happy he married a Spanish Asian. -What is that jacket? Salmon? -It looks like a maitre d from the Copa. Here, give me a $20 quick. We'll get a table. -I'm the father of the groom. -No. -That's funny. A lot of people do that. But you know what I thought when I saw you, I said, Camry. That's what I said to myself. Call me. I'll give you a good deal on a Camry. Talk to me personally, not to that bastard brother of mine. Ah, here you go. Frank Minetti. -Thank you, Frank. -Bye. -I still think he's connected. -Will you stop with that? You're going to give Johnny gas again. -Very funny. That audition ended Armand's acting career and nearly cost me my life, right, Therese? -Oh, come on, Johnny. Don't remind me. OK? ARMAND: Oh, Therese. The one casting person who genuinely loves actors. -Yeah. Well, she's dated about a thousand of them. -Yeah. And every one of them would have been more right for Capone than you or Dorian. -Ooh. God, I love you. -You should. At least now you have a career. -Yeah. What were those roles? It was the, uh-- the shady lawyer that got disemboweled and the shady lawyer that got impaled. -And the compassionate doctor who's head exploded. Hey, they pay me. I work. Right, honey? Muah. -Muah. Can you believe this? He's blowing me kisses. I can't decide what's weirder, the new, wild Steve or the old, depressed one. -Hey. How are you, honey? -Good. It's so good to see you. -Doing OK? -Hi. Congratulations. I'm sorry [inaudible]. -You all right? -Can you believe that, Johnny? She's carrying my kid. She still won't talk to me. WOMAN: So Johnny? -Yeah. -Who'd they finally cast as Capone? -Uh, we don't like to discuss that. WOMAN: No, come on. Who'd they cast? -Keanu Reeves. -Keanu Reeves? -That's right, the studio wanted to go another way. -No, the studio wanted a name. JOHNNY: Yeah, I know. Scorsese thought they were nuts, so Keanu's in. Scorsese's out. -Wait, wait, wait, what? The kid from the bus, he's going to play Al Capone? -I like Keanu Reeves. -Go meet somebody. Keanu Reeves? -Can you believe this [inaudible], Mr. M? Capone, the elementary school years. -Who understands show business? -(SINGING) Still searching out my destination. I just got back from all-- -Steve. -(SINGING) --from all around the world. -You OK? -Yeah, I'm fine. I got it all. Except for maybe a good cannoli every now and then, eh? I love that tofu. -Hey, Johnny. -Hey, [inaudible]. -Hey, Hannah. How are you? You look great. -Hey, uh, [inaudible]. Did you hear? The Palm is doing Mussolini. You're perfect. Check it out. -What are you doing? -Hm? No, no. Nothing. -Sorry. -Honey, what are you doing? You all right? -Yeah. -What else? -Mr. Mussolini. -Mr. Call me Benito. -Oh, please. [music playing]
