The cemetery, Dad. - And played the piano. - Piano. And crosswords. Crosswords. Even when she was older? Is that important? Sure, she did the crossword puzzle every day. OK. Fine. Her hobby. If it was part of her life, why not? Anything else? Did she like nature, or animals? Or... Sports, for instance? No, sports weren't really her... Dancing's a sport. Yes? She danced. Yeah, she liked to dance. Recalling the life of your dearly departed, we realize she didn't always... Yeah, yeah. ...have it easy. Born in 1933, raised with two sisters, who predeceased her, - she knew the hard... - Who died? and then the terrible years that followed immediately after in World War II. What remains is our memory and our thanks. Thanks for being there, Mom. For being with us. Thank you for caring for us. And a song. Your favorite. I think it's also one our father will like.

Emilia My heart is lost Emilia Can't you hear me? Since I saw you The bells keep ringing Emilia Whatever have you done? Emilia You've stolen my heart Emilia, my heart... ...is lost Come! - Hello. - Hi. Maybe you give me 100 more? - Next time... - 300. Next time, if you draw more people, and the take is good, I'll be happy to pay you more. Understand? It's not a problem. But if there's no work... Do you want the 200? Come on... - 200? - Sure, sure. 200, sure. I'm asking you, as a favor, for me... Maybe one more? Yes? No. Next time I'll give you more. Tonight was shit. We made nothing. Many thanks. Ciao, Richie. See you. Richie Bravissimo! As Richie's a good Christian, he'll buy you all a round of grappa. My treat! So, per favore, my... A schnaps song! Forgive me, Marie Now I need a schnaps! OK for you? Perfect. Please. She's making me blush. Careful, you'll fall off! Careful! It tickles... Grazie. We're so happy we drove down. That's the reason I'm still here. Your love. It's all about love, about amore! I'll say salute... to everyone. Salute! From your most devoted fan. For everyone! Here's to... to... the dolce vita! Dolce vita! Don't say anything. I just want you to... to say yes so that I can say no. Mi amore, I love hearing your beautiful voice on the answering machine, but I prefer speaking to you in person. Yeah. Please call me back, OK? It's your Richie, grazie. Stupid cow. Ciao, dottore. Can I have a grappa, a chiara bianca and an espresso? Thanks. - Got that? - Absolutely. Look at me. Yeah? With pleasure. Do you recognize me? No, I saw you once. Love at first sight. But... Good to know. I'm your child. Sure... All beautiful women are Richie Bravo's children. It's a fact. - Like a drink? - You haven't changed. - You don't... - I'm Tessa. - Sorry? - Hello, I'm your daughter. Nice to meet you, Richie Bravo. Slow down. Slow down. Yup, 18 years. What? Wait... I just had a flash. You're Tessa? Yeah, I'm Tessa. - I'm in shock. - Yeah, and I'm speechless. Sorry. It's been so long since I've seen you. Are you... What are you doing here? Did you just... I came to see you. And I found you. Sorry, let me look at you. You look like your mom. You should know. Please don't. Where do I begin? I only want what I'm entitled to. What you didn't pay for 18 years and robbed my mother of, and me too. - You mean money? - Yeah, money. You fucker! I'm Richie! I'm Richie Bravo! Hello. The prodigal daughter. Been to the ATM? I've been to the ATM many times. I have a problem, I need more time. How much more? More time? I can't say exactly. I may have to pay in installments. Paying in installments is out of the question. Please. This is the only favor I've ever asked you. Please. I'd do every favor in the world for you. The problem is, I need to put this together. I need a little time. - I can pay you... - How many years will it take? I can't arrange it overnight. You all imagine that, I dunno... "Us all?" Who's us? You kids. You think it can happen overnight. Mom's waiting for it. I'm waiting. We agreed that I'd get it. You'll get it. Now come have a drink with me. - Let's have a real conversation. - I don't want a drink! I want all those years back. I want what I could never have. Understand? - Fine. - A car. A car for my birthday. An apartment. - My driver's license. - I hear you. Private lessons. I hear you. But I can't. I can't make it rain down like manna from heaven. I need... a few days. Maybe a few weeks. - Give me some time. - No problem. But you'll cover my stay here, agreed? Later, yeah. I have to organize things. What do you do all day? Besides boozing it up in there? I work. There's a difference between having a beer... - One beer? One? - ...and coming up with 30,000! You have one beer? Yeah. Why, do you think I'm a drunk? I know you are. Interesting. How do you know that? I've been watching you. - Nothing's changed, like always. - Sure. "I'll stop smoking, stop drinking." I'm sorry, but what I do in my private life... Your private life? Aren't I part of your life? - Tessa! - Aren't I? Tessa, of course you are. But you weren't in my life for... - 12 years... - Is that my fault? Of course not, Tessa. But it's not all my fault either. I'd like a chance to explain. You can't blame someone without knowing what else was going on. - I'm so tired of your excuses. - Listen. - No. - Just listen. Already when I was a kid... You'd take me for a walk, everything was tralala... It was funny. Everything was fun. Blaming me doesn't help. If I somehow get it earlier, I'll call you earlier. - And in return I want... - What? For us to talk, reasonably. Agreed. - Deal? - Agreed. The day I get it. Don't bother. Don't, thanks. Don't bother. Who is that? My boyfriend. I'd like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen.... that we sometimes quarrel, we can be bad-tempered. We may even lose ourselves. Out of sight, out of mind. And we suffer from it. And with my next song, I'd like to plant a little hope in your hearts. For this isn't really The End of the Night. Already at dawn The siren blares in my head A glass of wine or two Drowns the longing for her Later in the night The stranger was there Next to her at the bar And it hurt so bad That was the beginning of the night It was the end of my life How could I live without her? Hey! You broke into your own home? Looks like it! I thought you'd be out. Sorry. Walter plays golf, but I'm here most of the time. I'm so happy to be here. And all by myself, too! Madame. Especially... for you. - Grazie. - Like a waiter. What a lovely surprise! Villa Bravo! Romantica. My favorite time's when I'm alone and I can prowl around. I just... Here, you sing, and I'll come in on the chorus. Good! - OK? So, I'm ready. Here goes! Super. Go ahead. - 1, 2, 3... Emilia my heart is lost Emilia can't you hear me? Since I saw you The bells keep ringing Emilia Whatever have you done? Wait, I'll just... You, too! Emilia, you've stolen my heart Emilia, my heart is lost Come! Yeah. I'll give you... 300 euros. 300? No way. I'm sorry, but I can't pay more. - If you want 300... - 800. - No. - 800 is... - minimum. - I don't deal in this stuff. If you want, here's 200... 300 euros. 400. If you want, there's 300 euros. Or keep your stuff. I'm not really interested. Here's 300. To help you out. Could you please get Tessa? Do you finally have it? Took a while. Finally? We have to talk. It's not so simple. It's turning out to be harder than I expected. - Let's go warm up. - Still no money? Sure, but come talk. I don't want to go anywhere. It's cold. We can talk there a second. It's cold here. Is back there a problem? - Fine. - Is that OK? - You have to ask him? - I want to ask him. You live here? Looks like it. Since Daddy hasn't paid. Tell me, do you love the guy? It's none of your business. You keep saying that, but... There's nothing to discuss. You want me to give you cash and help you out of your jam, and I will, but... "Get me out of a jam?" It's money I'm entitled to. Then you have to help me, y'know? Why should I help you? Did you once help me? It's money that you owe us, Mom and me. There are things that can happen, if you're in Syria, say, or in... I dunno, Iraq or Iran or, I dunno... Sure. ...as the 16th wife in the harem. You vanish and no one hears from you again. I'm not saying he's like that. I'm not a racist. I care about everyone. Did you care about me? About where I was? What I was doing? You don't give a shit if I go to Syria. - No way! - Not till now. And I apologized. I keep apologizing. Fuck your apologies. I've heard them since I was this big. - This is no... - All I ever heard was Sorry. This is no way for us to talk. I don't want to talk. Want me to kneel down? For starters. Show me what you can do, old man! If it helps you. And if it helps me. So together we can build something new. I don't want to build. I want you to be sorry. - For what you did to me. - I am. I've... - I'm so sorry. - Understand? - Deeply sorry. - I want... a future. First we'd have to get to know each other. - Exactly. - Fuck singing! - I don't want to be Riccarda Bravo. - You won't. I don't want your life. You have your own. I want you to show remorse. Your daughter is asking you. Richie Bravo is on his knees. You're the best audience I ever had. I say that every time. So... Good. Ladies and gentlemen, Dear friends... the next song... Girlfriends! Something upbeat. Shall we do Piacere? For you. This is Amore mio. Doesn't matter. If you worry it's all too late If you think you're alone with your fate If your heart holds you in its grip I'll be at your side If you think every dream's been dreamt And that every path leads nowhere If you can barely feel your heart beat anymore I'll be at your side Amore mio Amore mio, amore amor Amore mio Amore mio, amor - Your cunt! - Anna! - Your beautiful cunt! - Anna! Your sacred hole! Wait. What? What is it? Wait. Hot water bottle. There. I checked my cell. Sorry. All done. - Richie... - It's all good. C'mere, come... Let's keep going. C'mere. That's so good. That's it, you dirty slut! Suck it, you dirty slut. Come. C'mere. Put it in. You dirty slut. Yeah, dominate me. Come on, dominate me. Come on! Hurt me. Stop, stop, stop. I'm really sorry. I give up. C'mere. I can't do this. I'm done! It's a weird situation. I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. Richie... - Richie? - What? Get up. What's wrong? I can't do this today. I'm sorry. It's OK. You don't have to... I must be under the weather. No idea. But it has nothing to do with you. It's never the woman's fault. Stop. You're beautiful. Please go. Mom? Want some? Can you come out? Yeah? As a sign of good will, I'll hear you out. You'll hear me out? Now, suddenly? Think it's funny? No, it's not funny. It's really sweet of you. I'm just, I dunno, upset. That nice fellow's standing there, staring like he wants to kill me. What do you want to say? Tessa, there's so much I want to tell you. I can't just... Sweetheart... Sweetie. I can't tell you in just... Tessa, Tessa... I can't explain it all in five minutes here on the beach. I can't, it's impossible. I know that I owe you a lot. Y'know? But... But I... I can't do this on an ice-cold beach. I have... There's so much I have to explain. I... I... - What... - I thought of you often. What's there to explain? There's... - ...lot's to explain. - You weren't there. Wasn't what? You weren't there. You aren't now. I had to come looking for you. This can't be settled in five minutes, Tessa. It's... It's more than half your life. More than half your life. My entire life. But that's OK. I loved your mom. Sure! I'm happy you loved Mom, at least. Tessa, I... I was there when you were born. I know. Wasted. It's not easy for a man. Right! Your kid's born and you're wasted. My blood pressure was higher than your mom's. But she couldn't drink. You've grown so beautiful. Don't know what to say. You look like her. Answer me. I just want an answer. What can we do? Why... At least show me that you're somehow helping to support me in my life, you know? - OK. - Please. I will. I promise you that. - I promise, Tessa. - It's... Tessa, I... Look, I know I can't make things right with money. But at least I can show you that I... - You can do it for my future. - That I want to be there for you. It sounds corny, but I love you! Our journey's end was in sight We had come so far I still dream today of that time We rode, the two of us Me, by your side Across the prairie Our star shone bright But far, far away The two of us Me and you Winnetou Together we had learned How to build bridges That Red and White can unite And yet it was well before the end It was the beginning They slaughtered the buffalo all they could find Nothing remained for us When the White man wiped out every one of our dreams And today I see a child who sings of freedom And wants to dream of the time As we Me and you Never stopping to rest Fought for freedom My Winnetou My Winnetou Concentrate now. - A stitch in time... - Saves nine. Right! - A rolling stone gathers... - No moss. Correct. There's no place... There's no place... Like home. Absolutely, that's right! Don't put off till tomorrow... What you can do today. What you can do today. Right. The early bird... Though everything may collapse For today Germany marches with us Amore mio As soon will the world! Amore mio, amore amor - Onward we shall march - Amore mio Amore mio, amor Onward we shall march Though everything may crumble Can you open, Dad? For now Germany marches with us And soon will the world! I'll do it, Dad. There. For today Germany marches with us I need your password. Yeah, yeah. Hilde? Yeah, yeah. Yes? Ewald? Jaguar. You always wanted a Jag. Please, Dad. It can't be Rumpelstiltskin. Is Rumpelstiltskin your name? Perfect! Look at the moon! Incredible! It's so romantic! Isn't it? Is it far? Watch out! Careful! Ladies, you have to help Richie... - What? - ...help Richie stay on his feet. We are! You're like a polar bear dancing on ice. Are we almost there? Slippy Richie. Slippy? Slippy Bravo! Annie, are you crazy? Slippy Richie! You're Tricky Bravo. Gimme a break! God, what now? Right behind me. Slowly. He's abducting us in the basement. You guessed it, in the basement! You'll lock us up. Fun in the basement! I'm completely wasted. I won't make it up. Sure you will. - I'll push. You'll see. - Yes, push! The hope of a stiff drink works magic. So, ladies... What is your pleasure? Champagne! That's all there is? If I know my Emilia... There's no whiskey. Bubby, to toast the end of the world! We could make a bellini, there's juice. Look at this. Look what I have. No, no. The man must do it. We could stop here for a sip. Take a rest. A champagne stop. No champagne stop for us. No, we'll keep going. - That's for old farts. - A sip on every step! - Another floor? - A sip on every step! I'll still be here in the morning. Come on! Stop that. You're as fit as a young doe. - This is like Mount Everest. - It's these damn shoes. Finally! Are we there? - This is the suite, is it? - Could be. A hair dryer! We can dry our hair and warm up! Turn on the other one, the lighting's nicer. Now it's cozy. Wait, I have to turn this off. Very nice. A slumber party! Not the ceiling light. Turn it off! Isn't this nice? Just us three. And the dream of love. Spread out your fur coat like you always... Sure, of course. I'll leave you two. No, no, no, Emilia! I want to share a secret with you. Each of us tells a secret. You tell one, you tell one, I tell you one. OK. You first! - You go first. - Me? You go first, Richie. Alright. Don't fall asleep! Is this a shrink's couch we're on? - No, it's... - Come on, start already. It's just for fun. Here goes. Listen up. I had my first orgasm with my mother. Moron! Be serious! It wasn't that weird. It just happened. Just like that? My father... was away for a while, and my little brother was in hospital. I don't want to hear this. No, you have to listen. It's not some horror story, it's the truth. To make a long story short... I was allowed to sleep in my mom's bed. And you came? With your mom? Hold your horses, let me tell the story! So... Listen, pay attention. I... I... I'm lying in bed with her. And my mom was... She was an incredibly sexy woman. With these... big boobs and curves and... She was an icon! I start to touch her. I caress her here, on her breast and think, Man, is that nice! Don't hit! - Good, slap him! Slap him! - It was lovely. Then I move a bit lower down. I caress her... I caress her here, on her thigh. And then all of a sudden I feel something, I panicked. Something came out of me, that... What? How old were you? It started to shoot out and didn't stop. I had no idea. I thought I was dying. Was it real or were you dreaming? No, real! - What did she do? - She didn't realize. - She was asleep! - Right, she was asleep. - I don't have a story like that. - No? I mean, I have sexual stories, but not like that. But... Like what? Now I want to know! I was really young. 5, even younger. - Almost a baby. 'Cause... - Tell us. We always took our baths at the bakery behind our house. I loved it, it was warm. We didn't have a bathtub at home. Their bathroom was next to the bakery oven. Mom left me there alone. A man came in... one of the baker's helpers, I found out later. And, I dunno, he took me... He picked me up, sat me on something, and rubbed me against him. Later I realized it must've been his... his willy. It was pointing up and he rubbed himself against me. Then Mom came in and he quickly sat me on a towel. And somehow... Imagine... I saw his cock! It must've felt nice. I didn't mind. Really? I think I probably giggled, like... like it was a game. I mean, I was still little. Now for the next game. We played the truth game. Now we'll play... We'll play... We'll play Find Richie! OK, let's play. Find Richie! What are you doing? Leave my tits alone! Annie, that's also... I'll tell you a lesbian story. Annie, this game's fun too. It's a fantastic game. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 9, 10, 13... Stop! 20, 21, 22, 23, 24... It's dark. Richie Bitchy? Mine has a flashlight too. Richie Bitchy, come out! Or your eyes we'll scratch out! Emilia, he won't be in the next room. That'd be stupid. I dunno, he's pretty drunk. Where now? I'm going... Hold on, I'll comb each floor. - Not me. - It's this way. I'll look here. Please help us find you. Not there. Richie! Maybe you're not far away. What's this, a single room? Let's look. Richie, are you in the drawer? Richie, I'm coming. I'll find you! Richie? He wasn't there. I looked everywhere. He's gone. He can't have just dumped us here. - What? - He can't have just dumped us here. I don't think so. It's cold. Richie! I'm so cold. C'mon. Annie! I can't find him. - Do you really want to? - Yeah. - Do you want to? - Yeah. Say it again. Yeah! Shh! Here we are. My god! There's something I'd like. Yeah? Whatever you want. I'd like... I'd like... You know I sometimes... I sometimes... feel so lonely. And I've always found you incredibly hot. I'd like... I'd... like... I want this... to never end. That's what I'd like. You have incredible breasts. That really turns me on. That's what I need. I want something else too. I'd like... I'd like you to show me some love. Will you show Richie Bravo some love? Come here. Listen. Listen. Will you show Richie some love? Yes. How long have you known me? How long have you been my fan? A long time. A long time? Now he's yours. He's yours. Richie Bravo. Show him... Show him some love. Show him some love. I'm kneeling down before you. I'm kneeling before you. Kneeling is good. Show that you love him. That you really love him. I want you to look at me. Look at me. - Please, come. - Look at me. Say it. Say it. Say, Fuck me, Richie! Fuck me, Richie! Say it. Say it. Fuck me, Richie. Fuck me, Richie! Want me to fuck you? Want me to fuck you? Yes, fuck me. Fuck me, Richie. Fuck me. Show me your hole. Oh god. Oh god! Say it, say it. You gotta say it. It turns me on, when you say it. It excites me. Say, Fuck me, you dirty pig! What? - You dirty pig! - No, you're not a pig. What? You're not a dirty pig. You know what? Yeah? I really do like you, Emilia. Sorry, what? I really do like you. I hope you don't forget that. I hope you... I hope you don't forget that I like you. Please don't ever forget. - No. - You're a good woman. - A dirty pig. - With a big heart. I really like you, you know. Do you think... Do you think that Richie... is worthy of being loved? When a dream Any dream, doesn't come true When love comes to an end When even hope no longer exists Only loneliness And when a leaf Any leaf, falls from a tree Because the autumn wind has so decreed And when even fate Takes something from us Trust in time For the sun always rises again And every new day brings its light For the sun always rises again Because darkness doesn't last forever No, it doesn't last forever If I hear a song Any song we listened to I still feel how beautiful it was We were happy We were together You were here with me - Look familiar? - Incredible! What is this? Some scumbag scheme of yours? Unbelievable. Looks like it. Perhaps you weren't loving enough, dottore. - Want more? - Leave us alone. - Look how horny she is. - Sure. Look. I don't want to see it. Turn it off. What do you want? Let's make it fast. You disgust me. You should watch. I've seen enough. What do you want? Darling. That's OK. Can we...? Sure. What is it? Take a peek. With a heart! Count it. Thank you. You've made me happy. - Nothing's nicer than making you happy. - About time. - There'll be more. - Good. - Careful with it. - Thanks. Since the sun no longer shines for us, chérie And our love has endured a thousand tears I can't be the one anymore, chérie For it is done Thank you, chérie Ekkehart! Don't you know where your room is? Hello? We'll go this way. That's it, straight ahead. Here's the ladybug. Look. A wild boar. To each his due. To each his due. It was already dark As I wandered the streets toward home That's Richie! The glowing window of a tavern beckoned to passersby I had time and I was cold So I went inside So I just went in At every table sat men with brown eyes and with black hair And on the jukebox music played foreign and warm When they saw me A man stood and beckoned me over Greek wine Blood of the earth... Pour yourself a glass And if I grow sad It is only because I dream of home Forgive me Let's see. Hey. Hey, hello! We're here. Can we come in? Yeah. Here you are. Here we are. Thank you. Starting today, no more smoking. Is that so? Grandpa. Can you empty the ashtrays? Please? Thank you. Other wishes or ideas? Yeah, we'll sleep here. Really? Everything OK? You're not serious? I said all of us. No, I'm sorry, but... It's out of the question. They can't move in. This is my house! Yeah. Child! Hello? I'm your child. Come. Tessa, we have to talk. We'll see. - We have to. - We'll see. This is... It's outrageous, Tessa. It's outrageous. Nice and comfy here, huh? Good? Villa Bravo. Maybe you... I dunno... clean here? Sweep. Broom, y'know? We do. 'Cause, well... Make Allah happy! He told me. See you. Tada! Very funny. I came to see how you are. - Great. - Yeah? Good. See you. I came here as a stranger A stranger, I depart The month of May smiled on me With many a flowery bouquet The maiden vowed she loved me Her mother said we'd wed The maiden vowed she loved me Her mother said we'd wed Now the world is so dismal My path hidden by snow Now the world is so dismal My path hidden by snow Mama. Where are you? I shan't disturb your dreams You well deserve your rest You shall not hear my footsteps And softly I close the door As I pass it, I'll write Goodnight on your gate So that you will see That you were in my thoughts As I pass it, I'll write Goodnight on your gate Mama, where are you? So that you will see That you were in my thoughts That you were in my thoughts In memory of HANS-MICHAEL REHBERG, who last performed on camera in this film.
