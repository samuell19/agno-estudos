An adverb modifies a verb by telling us how something's done, where something's done, - or when something's done. - When something's done. Lucy. The music played quietly. And the adverb is? - Quietly. - Quietly. Sylvie. The dog runs through the house. Is right because... It's explaining where the dog ran. Is correct, but if you wanted to say how the dog ran... - Quickly? - Quickly. Very good, girls. Rosalie! Girls! - They're coming. - Oh, dear God! Mommy, what's happening? There are people coming for our horses, sweetie. Lucy, grab Jacob. Remember our plan. Sylvie, get away from the door! Grab Jacob's bear. I'll meet you at the top of the ridge. - Wesley, come with us. - If I don't, they're gonna take it all or burn it down. Let them. Please come. - Daddy, please come. - Run for the door, girls. Run for the door. - Please come. - Rosalie, run. - Go. Run, girls, run! Go! - Let's go, girls. - Go! - Run, girls. - Run! - Run! Lucy, give me Jacob. - Daddy! - Come on, girls. - Wesley. No. - Daddy! No! Run. Run, girls. Lucy! No! I got it. Hold her. - I got him. Got him. - Come on, redskin. Give up. Come on! Come on now. Come on, red. Get up, boy. Come on now. - Get up. - Come on, red. Get up. - Get him up. - Move now. - I said move! - Get up. - Hyah! - Come on. Come on. Looks like you got it, Joe. Yeah. How far did they get? Diablo Canyon. - Apaches, huh? - Uh-huh. Get up! It's gotta be about the end of them, eh? We think, but, like ants, they just keep coming. Y'all escape, this is what happens. Next time, we ain't bothering bringing you back. It ought not to be this way, Joe. Is there a better way, Tolan? Getting tired, Joe. I think I've reached the end of my sojourn. They say I'm not fit. Sort of have the... The melancholia. Mmm-hmm. Well, there's no such thing. Twenty years I gave this Union. They took my guns, Joe. You're out anyway. Hmm. What'd you give? Twenty? Twenty-five? I stopped counting. You remember that, uh... That time when Kiowa put his war-lance in your belly? Yeah. You remember you were sitting there in the water... just trying to hold your guts in there. Hmm. And I came by and you looked at me, and you had that look on your face. You looked so young. Like somebody had taken something from you. Like they had taken a Christmas present from you. They took your fucking horse, yeah? And we beated the hell out of it. And you say... "I see his face and I'm gonna kill him one day." And you did. You did. You ride him up in that blind path... and you took that knife of yours and you cut him from end to end. Yes, I did. Those were good days. Yes, they were. Those were... Those were good days. They were the best, Metz. Morning, sir. Corporal Molinor here. The colonel would like to see you. I'll get that. - Yes? - Captain Blocker's here, sir. - Morning, Captain. - Colonel. You know Jeremiah Wilks here, of Harper's Weekly. Sit down, Joe. I understand you finally run that escaped Apache bunch to ground. - Sir. Mmm. - Well done. Today, gentlemen, I don't know what we are going to do with this... these wretched savages. I have a suggestion. Why don't you let them all go? I mean, that would be the humane thing to do. Wouldn't it? I see the captain disagrees. Not my place to disagree. Bet if you had your way, you'd keep them in chains. That right, Blocker? Don't matter to me what you do with them. Now that I'm in your esteemed company, Captain, I must ask, it true you took more scalps than Sitting Bull himself? That's what I hear, anyway. - I don't care what you hear. - Gentlemen. I think that'll do. Captain, you do know Chief Yellow Hawk? You know I know him. The chief and his family have been prisoners for nearly seven years. I'd say that's punishment enough, wouldn't you? There ain't enough punishment for his kind. - Is that right? - Damn right, it's right. Let me ask you, Colonel. You remember Billy Dixon? Probably not. Billy was a very good friend of mine. I knew him very well, as I do all the men here. And I watched Yellow Hawk take a knife and cut Billy from stem to stern. And then he turned to my good friend - Tully McClain... - Yes, well, Captain... You're no angel your own self. Hmm. You know he's eat up with the cancer. Mmm. Well, the chief has asked for his release. Wants to go home to Montana. Some place called the Valley of the Bears. - You know it? - I do. Sacred Cheyenne territory. After due deliberation and communication with Washington, I've decided to honor that request. Allow him and his people to go. His release, it has become something of a... What you might call a cause célèbre. Back East. The Department of the Army wants to be certain that the chief gets there safely, without incident. Why are you telling me this? You speak as good a native dialect as anyone. Know the trails between here and Montana as well as anyone. - Do you not? - I've been over them some. I'm assigning a detail to accompany the chief and his people. And, quite frankly, you're the only one I can count on to get the job done right. So, you will lead the party to Montana. See the chief back to his homeland. Arrange the others back on the reservation. And from there you will cut off East to Fort Mason for your mustering out. With respect, sir, I'm not leading that cutthroat and his brood of bastards and bitches anywhere. I'm afraid it's an order. I'm afraid I ain't obeying it. Sir. You're retiring, are you not? I'm sure you don't want to tarnish your record at this late date with a court-martial. To tell you the truth, I don't give a damn. Well, you do give a damn about your pension, don't you? Let me tell you something, Captain. Aside from losing one's mind, there is very little to do for an old captain besides sit and whittle and whistle and wait for the postman to bring him his pension check. It would just be a damn shame for a man such as yourself who's put in the time to come up short in the end. You have any idea who that son-of-a-bitch is and what he's done? I know he was considered a very tough adversary in his day. And now he is a dying old man. No, he's a butcher. Then the two of you ought to get along just fine. Shut the hell up, you fucking pasty-faced... You have never seen a lick of war. - You have no idea... - No. No idea what it does to a man. I've killed savages. I've killed plenty of them. 'Cause that's my fucking job. And from what I hear, Captain, there was never a man happier in his work. Look. - Hmm. - I saw what happened to the 4th when Yellow Hawk and his dog soldiers got done with them. And there wasn't a... Don't you dare laugh. There wasn't enough left of those poor men to fill a slop pail. Understand... When we lay our heads down out here, we're all prisoners. I hate them. I got a war bag of reasons to hate them. Skinny Figler, Edwin Tate... Captain, I just don't give a damn how you personally feel about Yellow Hawk. I don't. What I care about is this, a direct order signed by President Harrison. So, you've got just over 24 hours to pick and provision your detail. Should you decide to disobey this order, you'll consider yourself confined to barracks pending a court-martial. Stop! This will be done. And it will be done by you. Now you're dismissed. I'll see to that, Captain. The rest is in my trunk. You can take that Apache war bow if you want it. Morning, doctor. Morning, Captain. Morning, Sergeant. Corporal. - Ready for the journey, sir. - As you were. - Lieutenant. - Captain. - West Point, hmm? - Yes, sir. I want to say what an honor it is to be chosen by you, sir. I'll give you everything I'm made of. - You can sleep on it. - That's why you're here. We don't get too many of you West Point types out this far. We'll see what they taught you. - Provisions? - Yes, sir. A month's worth of meat, raisins, sugar, and pickles. - Lead? - Enough to defend Fort Apache if required, sir. We'll need it. - Private. - Pardon, monsieur. Captain, I have a question before we depart on our journey. Hmm? As a new arrival to Fort Berringer, and, quite frankly, as someone with less than ideal experience... I don't... I'm just... I'm curious why you chose me. I didn't choose you. He did. You've got a good day ahead of you, Captain. Lord willing, the weather will hold and you'll avoid the monsoons. Chief. I shined them up for you real nice. They're good as new. I know this isn't the best duty you've ever pulled, but, uh, well, then again, you are getting out of this hellhole early. When the president asks, a man's got to do it. Anyone gives you any trouble, just show them these. They'll guarantee you safe passage. - So long, Colonel. - Good-bye, Blocker. Joe... You were a good soldier. I still am. Colonel. Detail! Forward march. The fucking parade's over. - Woodsen. - Yes, sir? Take this shit off them and put them in chains. Yes, sir. And take the braids out of the bitch's hair. Guide me O Thou great Jehovah Pilgrim through this barren land Guide me I am weak But Thou art strong Hold me with Thy powerful hand Break them here. - Kidder. - Yes, sir? - DeJardin. - Yes, sir? - Set up camp. - Right away, sir. We'll be back directly. And mind them Reds. Comanche. Captain. They're sleeping. Ma'am. Can we get you and your babies to safety? Get you... Get you warm and... Boys. Her babies are sleeping. Just try not to wake them. Ma'am. Let's get you warm. Get you some water. I'm not going to hurt you. I promise. Will you come with me? All right. Be gentle with them, please. God almighty. DeJardin! Captain, what the... Captain, what happened? - Comanche. - This far west? I thought they were settled on reservations. Some of them ain't ever settled. - Lieutenant. - Have you seen them, sir? No, but they ain't far. Well, start digging up on top of the ridge. Yes, sir. DeJardin. Grab them shovels over yonder, and them picks. Ma'am. - Yes, sir. - May I help you down? - Mmm? - May I help you down? All right. All right. All right, let's get a fresh blanket and some water for the... Just get a goddamn blanket. No, they ain't gonna harm you. They ain't gonna harm you. Come, look this way. Look this way. They ain't gonna harm you. Come on. Ma'am, we got a... Got a clean blanket here. Hello, ma'am. No! You will not touch this baby. - You hear me? - All right, step away. Yes, ma'am. I don't need that. - Drop those shovels! - Drop them! I will bury my family. - You hear me? - Yes, ma'am. I will bury my family. Shovel, please. ...for He will conceal me in the shelter of his tent and set me high upon a rock. Even now my head is held high above my enemies on every side, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of happiness. I will sing and chant praises to the Lord. Amen. Promise me that when I die, I'll be buried in this field. Promise me. Don't you take another fucking step. - Kidder. - Sir? Take the dress to the lady. She wants you to have this, ma'am. Mmm. You go ahead and take my tent. Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat? No. I'll bring my saddle up here and be right outside. You need anything, you just holler. I'll leave you in peace. She's broken, Joe. Yeah. What do you plan on doing with her? Take her to Winslow. Keep an eye on her in case... She ain't right. Captain. Everything all right, sir? Everything's fine. As soon as she's awake, we'll move out. Of course, sir. Heading out soon. You ready, ma'am? I am. Thank you. Rally! Get out of here! - Kidder? - Yes, sir? Unchain them. - Sir? - You heard me. If they put a foot wrong, you put a bullet in them. Yes, sir. You believe in the Lord, Joseph? Yes, I do, Mrs. Quaid. But... He's been blind to what's... going on out here for a long time. I see that. But I have to believe that it's times like these that strengthen our bond with Him. If I did not have faith, what would I have? By knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. A wise man is strong... I will seek it yet again. Be not thou envious against evil men and neither desire to be with them. For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. You can take your leave. Yes, sir. I ain't never killed a man before, Sergeant. That was my first. Is that so? How do you feel? Strange. And not in a good way. To just... take another man's life like that. How'd you feel when you killed your first? It was so long ago. How old were you? I was 14. I was fighting for the Grays. You know, if you sign up to be a soldier... it's your job. But if you don't do your job, then you're lying in a heap like DeJardin. And you remember that. You know, I've killed everything that's walked or crawled. Men. Women. Children. All colors. If you do it enough... you get used to it. It doesn't mean a thing. That's what I'm afraid of. What you don't get used to is... Is losing men. I've lost a lot of men. Is that them? Yep. And they ain't gonna bother us no more, either. Come on! Tommy. I do not like being humiliated and I'll tell you right now, you ever fall asleep on watch again, and it'll be you hanging from a tree. You fucking hear me, Sergeant? Everyone deserves their kill, Joe. Even them. Let's go to Winslow. Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. Hello, Ross. How the hell are you, Joe? - I've been better. - You never looked it. He's barely hanging on. Need to get him to the infirmary. Corporal. You're all right, Henry. - Look after this man. - Thank you, Corporal. You run into some trouble, huh? Trouble's been trailing us since we left Fort Berringer. Kidder, you see to DeJardin's body. - Yes, sir. - Ross, this is Mrs. Rosalie Quaid. - Colonel McCowan. - Ma'am. Mrs. Quaid lost her kit. Is the sutler's store open? Mmm-hmm. I'll have Minnie look after her. All right, I have no idea what a dress costs... - Hey, keep your money. - If you need... Thank you, Ross. I'll go check on them. Can I help you down, ma'am? Those folks in the Indian Bureau ought to come out here and spend a few weeks at Fort Winslow or on a reservation. The sickness, the starvation, the conditions those poor souls have to live under is nothing short of inhumane. Come out here, they'd understand. I'm afraid my wife has become a champion of the oppressed. Don't pretend you don't agree, Ross McCowan. Don't let him fool you. It just riles me the way the government treats them, that's all. They're human beings. They deserve to be treated as such. And need I mention they were here first? - That'll do... - That they're dispossessed at our hand. - And have received nothing. - That's enough! I will... You suppose that, um... You could put up Mrs. Quaid? Until the... until the stage comes through? I'd love to, but the stage stopped running six months ago. Stopped? They couldn't make a go of it. Hmm. There's the supply train, but it won't be here until Christmas. Well, Mrs. Quaid, I'm sure that you... Would be comfortable until then. Until Christmas. Christmas? Mmm. I suppose so. I... I suppose I have no choice. You're more than welcome to stay. I'm sure we'll find plenty to keep you occupied. Thank you, Minnie. Cigar? I want to ask a favor of you. I've got a prisoner who needs escorted to Fort Pierce. I didn't want to say over supper, but now that you're headed in that direction, I was wondering if maybe you could veer off a little bit and deposit him for me. Why all the way to Pierce? That's where he deserted from. Going back to face the courts. - For what? - Murder. Chopped up a whole hostile family with an ax. They say it was a hell of a sight. I'll take him for you. - You're sure? - Mmm. Listen, I'll understand if you don't want to carry that kind of burden. Ross, I've been carrying that kind of burden for some time now. Morning, Captain. Morning. How you holding up? All right. Well, if I don't breathe. Well then, don't breathe. Could be worse. Could have ended up like Frenchie. As you well know... death rides on every hand. In this case, a kind provenance is watching over you. It don't feel right. It don't feel right not helping you finish what we started. Feels like I let you down, Joe. You never let me down, Henry. You never let me down. Not one time. You're always... Centered. Focused. Without you on my flank, likely would have met my fate a long time ago. That's the truth. I hate to do this, but might be the last time I see you. It's been a real honor, Joe. Serving under you. Ain't many a man that would have taken me in. I won't soon forget it. You're a good man, Joe. I'd take you in a hundred times over, Henry. There's no finer soldier. And I'm telling you, your daddy would have been proud of you. All right. Any luck, we'll meet down the road. Henry? Take care of yourself. Yes, sir. You've been truly generous. I can't thank you enough for your hospitality. It's been our absolute pleasure, dear. And please, you take very good care of yourself, will you? I'll try. Captain. I know I'm an inconvenience, but I would rather be with you than just about anybody right now. - Kidder. - Yes, sir? Saddle up a horse for Mrs. Quaid. Right away, sir. Good morning, Joe. - Morning, Ross. - I trust you slept well? Never better. - Sergeant Malloy. - Captain. - Sergeant. - One of our finest. He'll be taking your prisoner to Fort Pierce. Thank you for these. It was very thoughtful of you. You honor... By wearing. Elk Woman. - And this is Narcos. - Where's Thomas? Collecting Wills, sir. - Colonel. - Corporal. Captain Blocker. It's an honor to meet you, sir. Godspeed. When I seen it was you who was to escort me, I said, "Goddamn, Phil, "your luck's finally turned." It has turned, hasn't it, Joe? You remember Wounded Knee, don't you? When we slaughtered them Reds something good? Yeah, I remember. I thought you would. I mean, how could you forget? We was on your flank all day long. I carried a dispatch to you from Colonel Reno. Mmm. To tell you the truth, I didn't think we were gonna get out alive. But watching you work them Lakota and the other belligerents, it was a sight to behold. Must have been how Custer had done it. No. Custer didn't do it. He met his end, as you well know. Yeah, but still... That old chief over there, he was... He was there that day, too. Funny you're toting them savages up north. It goes to show things have changed... Before long, we'll be giving them their land back. What got into you? I ain't never laid a hand on anybody who didn't deserve it. I don't know how you done it all these years, Captain. Seeing all the things you've seen. Doing all the things you've done. Makes you feel inhuman after a while. You just gotta take your dues. Suppose I will. But if it's just you and me talking, we both know it could just as easily be you sitting here in these chains. But I was just doing my job. What's going to happen to him? They'll hang him. - I'm gonna help them wash up. - They can handle it. And so can I. Oh, how shall a sparrow fly Or have the heart to sing If all she can do is cry About her broken wings If all she can do is cry About her broken wings Thomas, you stay with Wills. Kidder, watch the camp. - Get up. - What? Get your fucking ass up. I heard something. You making all the noise out here? Huh? Waking us the fuck up? It's nothing. Metz. Malloy. Malloy's dead. Reckon they're lucky it was no Comanche raping them. They'd cut them stem to stern. I once knew a woman down in Texas whose nose was burnt clean to the bone. Flesh gone. Nostrils wide open. Then they cut her beau's sack off, too, and stuffed his testicles in his mouth while he was squirming around. That's enough, Wills. Just telling the truth. A man that's done what you done, telling the truth won't help. How's that, Lieutenant? You know what he means. You and that yellow-eyed chief over there done worse than me. Hell of a lot worse and you know it. I've seen you butcher women and children. It ain't right, judging me. None of you. I'm a honest and decent man, and more than handy. If you need me to watch them demons for you, I sure as hell will. I fought alongside you. We're all guilty of something. I'm just asking for mercy. Mercy. Who've you become, Joe? Letting me die by the gallows, and saving this savage. I mean... You ain't who I thought you was. I would've died for you. And my brothers-in-arms did die for you. What did you do? You sent them to their deaths. You owe them. You owe them your life. Spitting on your men's graves saving this savage. And if you don't avenge them, then what did they die for? Kidder, put him back on the tree. Yes, sir. Get up. Come on. You ain't who I thought you was. Morning. I'm afraid that we're gonna have to break camp and, um... I was wondering if you think you might be able to ride or... I can get a travois ready for you. I can ride. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. I'm gonna drown out here, Captain! Shut up, Wills. We're all wet. Treating me worse than your goddamn animals! Kidder, get him coffee when it lets up. Yes, sir. Mrs. Quaid? You, uh... You okay in here? Need anything? A blanket or something? I don't need anything. Thank you. Where are you sleeping? I'll have one of the boys fix me up a place here. That's nonsense. Get in here and out of the rain. You sure? - Of course I'm sure. - Joe? What're you doing, Tommy? I gotta move on. What're you talking about? You get back inside your tent. You're gonna freeze. I don't feel anything. You've been a good friend, Joe. Here. Captain don't want you freezing to death. Hey. You all right? Hold on. Hold on. Put your head back. Oh, jeez, don't... don't shoot! Oh, God. Captain! Captain! Son of a bitch! Ah, Jesus. Kidder! That bastard! He jumped him. I'll get the horses. No, no, no, no. I got him. He'll bleed out inside a day. I can't risk any more men's lives for that son of a bitch. Tommy! Get back here, Tommy! Tommy! Oh, Jesus, Captain. He got him, sir. He got him good. Bury him? Give me a moment. And, Thomas, we set camp here tonight. Yes, sir. Sometimes I envy the finality of death. The certainty. And I have to drive those thoughts away when I'm weak. We'll never get used to the Lord's rough ways, Joseph. Thank you for kindness. Your spirit... You... Within me. Me... Within you. Thank you. Montana? Yeah. Will he make it? He's taking his last breaths. Billy Dixon. Tully McClain. Edwin Tate. Thomas. Name's Cyrus Lounde. These are my boys. This here's my land and I want you the hell off it. I seen you traipsing through my fields with that sorry Red. And I don't like it one bit. Mr. Lounde. This land here is his rightful burial place. Where we come from, Natives ain't got no rights. President's orders. There ain't no writing on no paper, president or not, can tell me what I can and can't do on my property. Hey. I ain't telling you one more time. Get your shit, your dead Cheyenne, and get the hell out of here. This is my land! Now, goddammit! You just ain't hearing me. You just ain't hearing me. We ain't telling you one more time. That savage stays here, you better make room for several more right next to him. Well, he ain't moving. Something tells me you ain't got the nerve to fire that, woman. 4:30 outbound for Chicago. 4:30. Last call. Chicago. All aboard. Well... I suppose this is it. Came sooner than I thought. You're a fine man, Joe Blocker. We can't thank you enough. Whatever may come, I want the best for you. I... Come on. Thank you.
