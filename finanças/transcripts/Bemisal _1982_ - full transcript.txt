I am very hungry. If you wouldn't come here for some time more.. You wouldn't get the food here. I would have sent the food in the dispensary. You aren't in your senses once you get a patient. What have you done to yourself? What can I do, Kavita? You know that I am the only doctor.. In the forty kilometers stretch here. Come on, wash your hands. Dammu's mother had come today. Do you know what she was telling me? What was she telling you? She was saying that you aren't human. You are God. Whatever I am, Kavita. I am all that just because of you. If you weren't there.. Why don't you say like this.. If he wouldn't be, what would we be? This is the one whom I am waiting for. I am counting each day for him. He has sent a letter. It is just six months left. Yes, there are six months left as yet. Come on, let us have the food. - Did you send the food? - Yes, I sent it. Doctor.. What happened? Dukhiya has started vomiting again, doctor. Okay, you go. I will come right away. It isn't in our fate to eat together. Give me the Tiffin. I will eat there. You have your food, okay? Sakhi.. Nine years have passed. But these last six months are torturous. I can't pass them at all. Every day seems like a year. I think about it all the time, when will I meet you? All of it seems as a dream. Do you remember how we met? It is just yesterday's matter. Prashant and me had gone to Kashmir.. After completing our doctorate for our holidays. Do you know, Sudhir? Almost all the hill stations of India.. Have been discovered by the British. But Kashmir is the discovery of the Mughals. - Is it so? - Yes. Jehangir was correct. If there is heaven somewhere, it is here. Yes. This is correct. But tell me. Why this lake is called the Dal lake? I haven't seen any more interesting lake than this. Wow.. interesting. It has the tresses of Bengal and Punjabi girls too. Hey, have you come here to look at the girls? No.. I have become a child specialist. All of them will be the mothers of my patients one day. But Mr. Chaturvedi. You have become a gynecologist. Then, why are you gazing at these mountains? - Come on, come to your real profession. - You too! Wow.. come on, we will see your diagnosis. Tell me. From where will she be? She must be from Gujarat. Gujarat? No. She cannot be from there. Why? If a girl has such a intoxicating gait.. She cannot be from such a state which is under prohibition. I think that she is from UP or Bihar. She has such a soft face. She cannot be from anywhere else, except Gujarat. Shall we bet a hundred rupees on that? Okay, come on. But how shall we decide? I will ask her. Are you mad? Do you want us to be beaten up? She can embrace us too. I am going to ask. You wait for me here. Sudhir.. - Greetings. - Greetings. Can I have a seat? Please sit. Have you come here for a stroll? I ask stupid questions too. If a person doesn't come for a stroll here.. Will they come here to play football? Like that.. where do you stay? See.. see. Please don't misunderstand me. I am a doctor. Dr. Sudhir Rai. I work in the children's ward of a hospital in Bombay. And him.. The one who turned away.. He is my friend. Dr. Prakash Chaturvedi. He is a gynecologist. Actually, we have placed a bet. For hundred rupees. And I say that you are from U.P. Or Bihar. He says that you are from Gujarat. Please tell me, whom out of us is correct? Both of you are wrong. I am from Maharashtra. Oh no! We will never be successful in our profession. Such a wrong diagnosis? How can you compare Gujarat, UP and Maharashtra? You don't have to be so disappointed. A little bit of your diagnosis is correct. How is that? Actually, we started staying in Khandala.. After father retired. Like that.. Two of our generations has been staying in UP. Then, you are from UP. Wow.. I'm a great. Hey, Prakash.. come here.. come here. Yes, come here! See. I have been introduced, but you didn't introduce yourself. My name is Kavita Goyal. See, come. - She is Kavita Goyal. - Greetings. She stays in UP. - Give me hundred rupees. - Don't give it to him. We stayed two generations ago in UP. Okay. If not hundred rupees, ten rupees is the proper amount. - Give it to me. - Okay, take it. Cash, right now. Okay. - Come on, quickly. - Yes, have some patience. - Greetings. - Greetings. I am Dr. Sudhir Rai child specialist. And he is Dr. Prakash Chaturvedi gynecologist. And she is Miss Kavita Goyal. And he is Dr. Ram Narayan Goyal, my father. I am sorry. Are you a doctor too? But not a doctor like you. I am a doctor of literature. Oh God! Why? This is one subject that I am scared of. You are scared of just the subject, isn't it? You don't have to be scared of me. From where you people have come? - We have come from Bombay. - Okay. We have to go to Pehelgam. Yes, even we are just leaving for Sonmat. - Okay. Come on, child. - Farewell.. - Farewell. Come on, Sudhir. Let us arrange.. For a car to go to Sonmat. Who will go to Sonmat now, you fool? Why? Pehelgam.. we will go to Pehelgam. But have just stayed there for seven days. Okay, she is going, therefore. You have a bright future. You have diagnosed correctly for the first time. Please wait here. We will come right away. Come on, Prashant. - Greetings, Miss Kavita. - Greetings. You? You people were about to go to Sonmat, isn't it? Yes, but Prashant said that we must go to Sonmat first. What did you say, Prashant? Yes. We will go to Pehelgam and then everything else. He writes poetry, therefore.. We thought that we will see Pehelgam too. - Please listen. - Yes? Please call my father and.. - Two cups of tea for them.. - Okay. Have you come back, sir? Yes, so what if we have come back? You please go and bring the tea. Can we have a seat? Yes, please sit. Come on, Prashant. Have a seat. This means that you have come here earlier too? Did you see that, Prashant? Therefore, I tell you. You shouldn't lie. When do you speak the truth? Yes. This is correct too. Okay, Miss Kavita, don't you think.. That Pehelgam is a place where a person should come repeatedly? Yes. - You are right. - Therefore.. therefore.. Do you know one thing? Prashant. You don't know it. Listen to it. The Britisher's have discovered.. All the hill stations in India. It is only Kashmir, which was discovered by the Mughals. - Really! - Yes, keep in mind. The Mughals cannot be compared at all. Look at their paintings and art. But you forgot the greatest contribution of the Mughals. What is that? Mughlai food. Madam.. madam.. Please come, sir seems unwell. Come on. We will see. Please don't worry. You just need some rest. We will not let you travel for seven days now. Seven days? Then it will be a problem. Kavita has her first radio program on the 17th. Please don't speak like children. I will write a letter. Listen.. do you speak on the radio or something? She doesn't orate. She sings. Is it? Your daughter is very talented then. But, I am a great father too. I ruined her holidays by falling ill. She will not be able to roam around too. Why will she be not be able to roam around? When I will sit and blabber with you.. Prashant will go and move around with her. And when Prashant will sit with you.. I will go around with her. Then, when you will get well, all of us will go around together. - How is my cure? - Your suggestion is very good. Really. It is god's grace that we met you. Or else, father's illness in a foreign country. I don't know what I would have done. No. He didn't have any special illness. Or, I wouldn't have left him and came with you. And then, we live in a society. You get someone or the other for help. Yes. But for that someone to be a doctor.. And leaving all their work, coming for help in trouble.. Miss Kavita.. Time is the turning point.. In which one stranger coming from one side.. Sees the other stranger coming from the other side and stops.. And starts thinking that.. We have met somewhere at some point of time. Hey.. You are a poet. How did you become a doctor? Yes. Sudhir and I studied together. He wanted to be a doctor. Therefore, I too.. You are very fast friends. Oh, just like some religious story.. The people call us Lord Ram and Lord Lakshman. Do you write poetry like Mr. Prakash? Poetry? Okay. So he has started reciting.. Poetry to you as soon as he got a chance? So what? He wrote such a nice poetry about 'Dal-Lake'. The moon comes here secretly. And in this lake.. People spit, and clean their clothes. See, Miss. Kavita. Your name is Kavita. Therefore, I won't say anything against poetry. But the truth is, nobody has seen the feet of the moon. So, I don't know how it can come here secretly. But it is just a phrase, a concept. If giving a false phrase makes a poem, okay. Far away, at the deserted shore stands.. A tattered old tree adjoining a young one. Having seen centuries of loneliness, it whispers to the young tree. It is all silence and solitude. Talk something. Excuse me, but I don't like to read poetry. You don't like to listen to it too? I don't understand at all where the question of likings is? Can I tell you something? You won't feel bad? Tell me. Tell me. I don't like to read or hear poetry. But I like to see poetry. See, it seems that I will be boring you pretty soon. Therefore, I will stop my blabber.. So there should be a song.. - Sing? - Yes. It is the 17th today. It was your program in radio too. - Therefore.. - But.. a song here? Yes, you can sing between four walls.. And you cannot sing here? Yes the only difference is that there is a microphone.. And here.. The microphone is standing in your presence. "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "You wander around.. Who is your beloved?" "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "What is your relation with the cloud?" "What is your relation with the cloud?" "Why do you dance and sing?" "Why do you dance and sing?" "When the monsoon arrives?" "You wander around.. Who is your beloved?" "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "A lone.. you.." "My friend.. you.." "A lone.. you.." "My friend.. you.." "The one who isn't befriended by anyone.." "The one who isn't befriended by anyone.." "You are her friend.." "You wander around.. Who is your beloved?" "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." "Whom does your mind search.. While traveling, o breeze.." Hey, Prashant.. What are you writing? I was just looking at the photos developed. Look at the photos later. First, go and do the packing. Yes, okay. Miss Kavita, time is the moment that.. Oh brother.. quickly.. Uncle is waiting. Look at this. The magic of our tailor. Is this a shirt or a tent? This tent belongs to this tall man. Did you not see it before? Oh.. is it your shirt? Your heart beats are rising before reaching Khandala? Control you heart. As it is, it isn't your mistake. She is like that only. What about you? Anyone who sees, will be stunned. Very good, God has made such a beautiful thing. Come on, you get ready. I will leave. Morning, uncle. Come, Ramlal. Did you read the newspaper today? - The prime minister has written.. - Did you take the medicine? Listen to it at least.. He has said.. If you take the medicine on time.. The blood pressure will be under control. - Give it to me. - Here. Raghu.. hey Raghu.. Give me the breakfast. Where is Chagganlal? He is getting ready. What is the matter? You seem dressed up too. What is the program so early in the morning? We wished to go to Khandala. That Mr. Goyal is not well, isn't it? Mr. Goyal? I have heard that Mr. Goyal is all right now. Yes.. it is all right. Khandala is a nice place for the health, isn't it? Yes. There is no pollution there. The air is fresh and the water there.. What is the name of Mr. Goyal's daughter? Sita or Urmila? Yes? Tell me. Who likes Khandala more? - You or Prashant? - Prashant, Prashant, uncle. Okay. Then the girl's name is Urmila. Urmila or Kavita, it is all the same. We are caught isn't it? We knew that we will be caught one day. After all, how long can we fool.. An experienced magistrate like you? We are children in your presence. See, Sudhir. Prashant has searched his Urmila. Now, you search for your Sita too. And marry off quickly. Then you go to study to America. I will stay here nicely after that. Two daughter-in-laws will serve me. I am not in a hurry to search for my Sita. - Because I am not going to America. - Why? That same matter. You know that I have become a child specialist. What will I go doing there? The problems of the children there.. Are over nutrition, over medication.. Over eating, the problem is there in this country. Children don't get proper food here. Prashant wants to become a gynecologist. Let him go to America.. - Sudhir, I want that.. - Uncle.. I am the judge of the supreme court. The judgment that I have given is the final. The end. I will not be leaving you alone. Come on, have your breakfast. Kavita is twenty seven years old, Ramnarayan. At least have this bit of a worry. She is a young girl. She is moving around, smiling and laughing with two young boys. Let her move around, sister. Prashant and Sudhir are not any wastrels. That I should worry about them. I haven't seen a father like you. Even lice don't move on your hair. Lice? How will lice be formed? I don't have hair at all. You tell me. Whom do you like from the two? What is there to like in them? Sudhir has been reared by Prashant's father. He isn't a son or any relative. Prashant is alone son. Please come. Where is Doctor Sudhir? Both of us were coming here. On the way, a child came under a truck. Is he hurt seriously? He has been hurt seriously. Sudhir took him to the hospital. And I came here. I wished to speak to you. Where is uncle? Sudhir liked CHIKIS a lot, isn't it? Therefore, he went to get it. Okay. I don't know.. how to say all this. I am going to America after a few days. For higher studies. I wish that before I leave, we should get married. I know that you must be stunned because I spoke about this suddenly. I know what you think about it. You just say yes, and I will speak to father. - But.. - No ifs and buts. I can tell you.. You won't be going to some fool. A husband like Sudhir.. A friend like Sudhir.. Only very fortunate people get such. He is true gold, Miss. Kavita. True gold. - Then? - Then what! Dr. Mathur has cut both his legs. He will be saved now. If I was in place of Dr. Mathur.. I would have killed that child on the operation table itself. What? Being a doctor.. I am right. He is the son of a poor man. A poor man cannot live with two legs. How will be able to survive with two legs? Whether they are rich or poor.. The life is the same for both, isn't it? No, Miss Goyal. When a rich person dies, they leave happiness behind them. But when a poor man dies.. They leave behind sadness. If someone doesn't know you closely.. They will think, you are so harsh! How will I become harsh? You are the harsh one. - Me? - What else? A poor man is dying in your love. And you don't worry about him at all. Listen, Miss Kavita. Tell me clearly. Are you ready to marry, or not? See, where will you get such a boy? He is a doctor. He doesn't smoke or drink. He is the only son of his father. He is going to America for higher studies. Whom are you talking about? About Prashant, who else? He is going to a foreign country for studies. What if he fails in his examination.. In the pain of your love? You are strange people. You are recommending him today. Yesterday, he was recommending you. - Recommending me? - Yes. Okay. I understand. He must have got the guts to speak.. About his marriage, therefore he spoke about me. But, Madam. Prashant knows this very well. On medical grounds.. I cannot marry. I have a elder brother.. Who is crazy. I have another matter, I am telling it just to you. I have an affair with a girl. Is there any other secret in your life? Yes. You will get my name in the police records even today. I have a criminal back ground. Will you want to hear it? Will you be able to hear it? Hear. Because I haven't been able to tell anyone till today. My heart is heavy. Maybe, if I tell you, I will be satisfied. Tell it. Then come outside. The story is very big. This room will be small. I lost my mother in my childhood. Father was a teacher in the school. There were just three beings in the house. Father, brother and me. Even then the house couldn't run. We used to get food only once in a day. If we got food in the day, we wouldn't get it in the night. If we got it in the night, we wouldn't get it in the day. Brother was a very good student. Father was hoping that.. Brother will change our times after his MA. In those days.. There was a new district magistrate in the city. His son came in my class. My father was employed to give him private tuitions at home. Father took the permission to take me along with him.. So that I could be educated with him too. He was a magistrate. Greetings, teacher. Greetings. Why did you stand up? Sit down. Son, look here. A new life started for me from that day. I wasn't interested in studies. I just used to wait for six o' clock. When mother used to bring the snacks. Here you are. What is the need for this everyday? So what? Have it. Here.. Here.. - Okay, I will get some water. - Okay. But while I ate the snacks, I used.. To have a strange hatred towards them. Why was there such a difference between us? Why does Prashant go wearing a clean shirt in a car to school? When I just go in my slippers and a torn shirt. In that jealousy, one day.. I stole Prashant's homework book. Forty eight thousand divided by.. Two will come out to twenty four thousand.. And here, ninety eight thousand multiplied by.. - Okay? - Understood. Have a seat. Get the homework books one by one. Prashant? What happened? I am not finding the book, sir. This means that you didn't do your homework. I did it, sir. Shut up. First if all, you didn't do the homework.. And you lie on top of that? Stand up on the bench. Stand up! Sudhir.. What is it? Here. Hit me, hit me as much as you want. But please don't tell it to father. Why? Are you scared that teacher will hit you? No. I am not scared of the beatings. But if you tell it to the teacher.. He will not take me to your house any longer. And if I don't come to your house.. I will have to fill my stomach drinking tap water. Prashant forgave me. I used to go to his house like everyday in the evenings. And I got the snacks. Then one day, Prashant's father was transferred. And my father was transferred too. Up there. Really, problems don't come alone. My brother went crazy. There was darkness all around me. I just had two ways in my options. Either to beg and get what I want, or snatch it. I thought that the person who doesn't have anything.. He has all the rights to snatch.. Things from people who have everything. I joined a gang. And I kept stealing.. Wandering from one city to another. Here. Sorry, sir. I am blind. Please help me cross the road. - Where do you want to go? - Telli Gully. Come. Greetings, inspector. Greetings. Careful. There is a ditch ahead. You will slip. That's okay. I will go myself now. May God bless you, sir. May he keep your family happy. Do you learn the tricks from cinema? All of you will be caught today. Here. - How much is it? - I don't know. Here. What is this? Just ten rupees? How much do you want? It is so much money. At least give me fifty. Take whatever I give and get lost from here. Or else, I will give you fifty slaps. Fifty rupees. Did you father ever see fifty rupees? Son of a beggar. My father wasn't a beggar. Then what? Was he a minister? If you weren't the son of a beggar.. You wouldn't go around stealing wallets like this. If you say it again, it won't be good, Kalia. You are a beggar, your father is a beggar. And even your grandfather is a beggar. Shirke.. arrest them both. Take them.. Take them away. The police caught and took me away from there. To the hospital first. And then to the court. I was startled when I went to the court. Because the magistrate was.. Then he had me released. Here, please sign here. Thank you, sir. Come on, son. Come home. You will stay with us now. What work will I have to do? Work? You will have to work. You will have to do three tasks. Playing while it is the time to play. Eating while it is the time to eat. And to study while it is the time to study. He admitted me to school along with Prashant. And then, after college, to medical college. Prashant and me. Ram and Lakshman incarnate. But my past is there, isn't it? A criminal background, a mad brother. I don't have a respectable back ground, madam. I have committed many sins. I can't get married. So I want that you marry with him. Whether I marry him or not.. How are you related with that? A astrologer told me that.. All my sins will be cleared off if I have my friend marriage. If you don't agree to it even after this.. I will have you kidnapped. And if I say yes? Then I will happier than Prashant. Here, have some tea. Why are you staring at me like this? Please take it. Have a seat. I want to talk to you, have a seat. I have changed my decision. What? Sudhir is not going. I am thinking, I will cancel my going to America too. Sudhir has told us why he isn't going to America. But what is the reason for you to not go to America? The reason for me not to go to America? It's you. See. You are not a twenty year old young man. You are a doctor. And father wants you to become even a bigger doctor. Therefore, don't even think about all this. Then, should I do something.. Should I tell Sudhir to try something.. And tell dad to send you with me. No. And will dad live alone here? Why alone? Sudhir will be with him, isn't it? But listen to me at least. You have to go to the passport office. Get ready, quickly. Bless you, daughter. Bless you. Stop this asking for blessing every day. - And think about yourself as the daughter of this house. - Yes. And think that Prashant is the househusband here. She has buttered you by all this, uncle. She has won over your heart in a day, isn't it? But butter is applied only on toast here, madam. Why are you calling her madam? Shall I shorten and call you mad? See this, father. Why? Can't you call me sister-in-law? In which Mahabharata is it written that Lakshman's wife be called.. Sister-in-law by Lord Rama? Not Mahabharata, Ramayana. Yes, that's it. You are correct. According to the birth certificate.. You are twenty days older than Prashant. Why don't you call the younger bride? No, father. See, it is objection your owner already. What if I call you Sakhi? Wow.. Lord Krishna used to call Arjuna as Sakha. And he used to call Draupadi Sakhi. Use to protect her. I knew it, Ramlal.. there is a poet in you too. This is what I felt too. He is a very bad man. Good morning, dad. Morning, my son. Why were you people laughing? Prashant, I gave your wife a strange present today. What? A new name. Sakhi. Wow! This is called a cheap present. One needs a heart to spend. You are right. I have kept my heart in the safe deposit. There are a lot of robberies nowadays. God knows when one can rob mine. Here. A present from my side too. Open and see what is there in the envelope. How are you connected? Hey, I am connected to everything related to you now, Sakhi. What is this? You had met in Kashmir, isn't it? Yes. Then go to Kashmir and spend your honey moon. But why three tickets? Why should I go in their honeymoon? Have Ram and Lakshman ever separated? They went together for the exile too. Hey, Sakhi. Don't give us this ideas. That was an exile. This is a honey moon. - Okay, then don't call me as Sakhi. - Why? "This is such a beautiful picture." "The weather is so aromatic.." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is such a beautiful picture." "The weather is so aromatic.." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is a Kashmir.." "There are heavens beneath the mountains." "We are here today." "There are heavens beneath the mountains." "We are here today." "Friend.. this is our fate.." "This is such a beautiful picture." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is a Kashmir.." "From this sky, from this earth, this garden of flowers.." "It is difficult to go away from here!" "From this sky, from this earth, this garden of flowers.." "It is difficult to go away from here!" "Oh, is this a breeze or a chain?" "This is such a beautiful picture." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is a Kashmir.." "This is a Kashmir.." The Shankacharya temple is up there. - What is there to eat? - Whatever you say, sir. Sandwich.. Pokora.. samosa.. Pakora. Okay, bring three plates samosas. - And three cups of tea. Quickly. - Yes. Leave the tea man, ask for beer. Forget about beer, get some whiskey. Whiskey? At this time? Yes, one should be intoxicated. At all times after coming in Kashmir. Waiter.. Hey, the whiskey's mother is coming to us all by itself. Wow! Hey, Prashant. Do you remember that mountain? We had met there for the first time. Yes, I was stuck there the first time. Have you noticed something, friends? The girls nowadays have fun with two people. Then, why are you jealous? Why shouldn't I be jealous? There are three here and two there. And there is someone there and there isn't anyone here! They are the rotten kids of newly rich people. Let the mad dogs bark. Why do you hear them? I will not hear them, I will just hit them. Forget it. - Morning. - Morning. Please, one minute. Thank you. Where have you come from? Delhi. Why? Because you seem from good families. Yes. But I am sad to say, your parents have expired. What are you saying? Our parents are alive and well. No. If they were all right, you wouldn't be so insolent. You are certainly orphans. - Don't touch that. - I will eat one. Keep it there else I won't spare you. I will eat this, okay. Brother.. hold this. Please don't go. Sudhir.. - Insolent.. - Move, Prashant! You raised your hands on us? Yes. Shall I kick you now? This richness won't work in our presence. Get lost from here. Come on! Here you are. This saree is for me. Am I going to America? For me? Why are you angry on me? Sudhir brought it for you. Why did you bring saree. This is strange. This is the first Indian woman whom.. I see not happy while getting a saree. Sakhi.. when Prashant goes to America.. You will be at peace for somedays.. - With this saree, isn't it? - Don't talk rubbish. Why are you not going to America? Prashant.. women's mind is just like a gramophone peg. If it is stuck somewhere, it is stuck there. Then, there is no respite from that. Do you what to know why I am not going to America? Yes. I know that. Come here. Sit down. See.. You have been newly married. - And he is leaving you. - Yes. This is confirmed that he will yearn for you there. So, it is possible that he embraces.. Some maiden there to quench his thirst. What? Why? Is this what you wish? This is not my wish, but what can be said about the future? What do you say, Sudhir? What about the future? I want this to happen. Is it? If this happens, you will be very happy, isn't it? Why not? If he embraces some maiden there.. I will get you in second hand to embrace you. Insolent.. you say anything that you want! God forbid! His joke! Are you not ashamed? To laugh at such jokes? See, Kavita.. There are only two people who can joke like this. One, the people who have some sin in their hearts. And the others, the people who have no sin in their hearts. Do I have to tell you what kind of a person Sudhir is? I am leaving you in his care to America. And I won't be having any worries there. So you won't have any worries there? Worry? You won't wait for anyone? Not even the post man? Post man. Oh yes! I remember! Okay, come on, promise me. You will write a letter to me every week. No, once in every two weeks. Then, one in every three days. Okay.. once in one week. No, one every day. Promise me.. promise me.. I promise. Father. The medicine. The album is a great thing. People, places everything is right how is it is. Now, it is ten months that Prashant has left. See, from his childhood to today.. He is right here. I saw forty years of my life. Why are you so sad, father? It is a matter of days now! I am the only one who is sad. The rest of the house is very happy, isn't it? There is such a silence in the house because he has gone. I can sometimes hear your voice. But Sudhir is so silent! Doctor.. Oh, you.. I told you not to rise from the bed? My fever has run away. Didn't you say that drinking sour medicine.. - Will make the fever run away? - See, wasn't I correct? But why didn't Meena's fever run away? Even she takes sour medicine. Who says that it hasn't disappeared? Come on, we will have a look. Meena.. Greetings, uncle. Greetings. Let us see whether your fever has come down or not. Your fever has decreased. Meena's fever is running, isn't it, uncle? Totally. The elephant has gone and the tail is left. Coward! The elephant left his tail and ran away. Did you see the magic of my medicine? Uncle, do you get fever sometimes too? Yes, I do get fever too. Then, who gives you the medicine? Child, I don't have anyone to give me medicine. Okay, I will give you the medicine. Will you have yourself cured by us? Yes. Of course, why not. - Then give this to me. - Yes, of course, take it. Take a deep breath. A deep breath. Show me your eyes, son. Show me your tongue, your tongue. Not like this. Open you mouth properly. Our son has got all the teeth! Sir, Mrs. Chaturvedi has called. Urgent. Okay. You stay here. Give it to me, son. Hello. Yes.. I will come.. I will come right away. What happened, sir? Uncle. It seems he has a heart attack. This is the fourth one. Is it hurting a lot, father? The doctors must be arriving right away. No, daughter-in-law. It seems that even the doctors.. Will not be able to do anything this time Father, please don't say anything.. Let me speak, daughter-in-law.. See, don't feel bad. Prashant is your husband, But I am his father. You know him since a year. I know him since childhood. He is very weak. He can break under pressure. Therefore, if there is such a moment in life.. Have faith in Sudhir. Uncle.. Sudhir, you have come? I want to talk to you. You lay there silently. Listen to me first. Promise me that you will not tell anything to Prashant. It is only six months for his studies to get over. Uncle, do you know how angry I get with these matters? First, you get all right. And then tell me whatever you want to. I will call Dr. Kapoor. The phone is dead. It was working fine a moment before. I will call Dr. Kapoor. Sudhir.. listen to me.. listen.. He has gone. Daughter-in-law.. He seems to be a happy go lucky man.. But he is very sad actually. Look after him nicely. When I brought him home.. People told me.. Bring a dog from the dirt and gutter. The dog will remain loyal. But don't bring a man out from the dirt. The man will kick you one day. Because you know the secret of his birth. But.. But I didn't agree to them. And wow.. wow. He came true to my belief. Daughter-in-law.. There is your mother's photo there. Yes - Please bring it. Father.. father.. father! Doctor.. Sorry, Sudhir. We were late by half an hour. Sorry. Sudhir.. Sudhir. Sudhir. What happened to you? What happened to you? Why don't you speak? Why don't you speak? Where did you go so early in the morning? I went to Dr. Ibrahim's house. He is migrating to Israel. I am thinking of buying nursing home. Nursing home? Yes, Sudhir. I don't want to live like this. Like this? Now, I have understood something. Moving ahead in our profession is not a straight journey. It is a crooked journey, a totally crooked journey. Keep talking.. I will speak. I got such a huge degree from America. Did I get a job? Did I start my practice? - Why are you in such haste? - I am in haste.. Because.. in our country. A person takes his whole life to make.. Eleven rupees of ten rupees in our country. But is a snap to make eleven lakhs out of ten lakhs. And this is what I wish to play with. If we have a huge nursing home. And we can give a commission to all the big doctors.. You will find out what progress is. - Shall I make it for you? - No. Prashant, tell me something. Is this the only way to progress? Yes, if you want to progress.. The way which comes first.. Is correct. Why did father send me to America? To become a big doctor. I didn't see him as he died. But I will fulfill his desire. By hook or by crook. Just a minute. Not here. There. You will die in these sentiments one day. We have to die one day. Why don't we die in sentiments instead of illness? Anyway.. Forget all this. Tell me. From where will you get.. The money to buy Dr. Ibrahim's nursing home? I will sell this house. You will sell the ancestor's house? When father isn't there, what will I do of the ancestor's house? What do you say, Sudhir? It is your wish, brother. What will I do with just my wish? He has made you a share holder of his will too. Oh yes, I had almost forgotten. What to do? It's just a signature. Here. Here. Give this letter to your employer.. And tell him that the furniture should come in two days. Sakhi.. Oh.. Sakhi.. Wow.. the furniture has come, isn't it? Careful. Did you like it? Yes, first class. Come have a look of your room also. Err.. just a minute. Didn't I tell you, that I have take.. My room just near the children's hospital? Can I ask you, why you cannot stay here with us? Please ask. Ask. Sudhir, don't anger me more, okay? Prashant. Your wife is beautiful but up there.. See, Sakhi. How far is the hospital? Sixteen kilometers. If there is some emergence case.. Till the time I reach there.. I will be.. And if I make haste, this is Bombay. All the places are dug up here, it is all a trump. If I have a accident, the doctor is gone. Prashant, tell your wife not to look at me like this. I get weak. My heart beats and I can't control myself. See. Tell her.. I will kidnap her. Handled it. Your settled house will be ruined. You will be ruined. I am ruined. Why don't you try to understand, Sakhi? Didn't I tell you that I have a couple of affairs? When Prashant was a bachelor, it was all right. But what will I do in front of his wife? I am immoral.. but I have some dignity. I will go now. I have to go to the hospital. Hey.. why are you in such a hurry? The taxi is standing outside. The meter is running. He has started to make my blood boil nowadays. But then, sometimes I think that he is hiding something too. - 537207? - Yes? May I speak to Dr. Agarwal? Yes, speaking. - Good morning, Dr. Agarwal. - Good morning. I am Nandini Malhotra. I am Dr. Prashant Chaturvedi's PA. I had just called you to remind you.. That Dr. Prashant's new nursing.. Home is being inaugurated next week.. And also his house warming party. He has said that is necessary for you two to come. Yes, surely, we will come. Thank you, Doctor. Tea. Thank you, Susheela. Did you do all the phones? How can I do all the calls? I had to move my fingers times for sixteen calls. My fingers were ruined. Why? Were the phones engaged? No. They weren't engaged. Just wrong numbers. Good morning, Susheela. - Good morning, sir. - Please have a seat. Did you remind everybody? There are just a few calls left now. - Susheela.. - Yes, sir? Please tell Dr. Dubey and Dr. Rehman.. I am coming to the operation theatre right now. I will the new machines that have arrived. Okay, sir. And. Did you call him? Yes, sir. I will make this call right now. Come, Sudhir. Sudhir, this is my PA, Miss Malhotra. - And he is my partner.. - Dr. Rai? Yes, but I am in his partner. Only in profit. This is his life partner, Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi. This is. Miss Malhotra, my PA. What did you say? My dear.. My PA. Miss Malhotra.. I have seen you somewhere. Even I have seen you somewhere. I don't know where you have seen me. But Mrs. Kavita and me studied together.. In the Sophiya Women's college. She was two years senior to me. I know her from the women's college. How do you know her? Did you study in the women's college too? Why will I study in the women's college? I was a wastrel. I just roamed around the colleges. May be I must have seen there. You too.. Please don't feel bad about what he says. He says whatever he feels like. Come on, we will go to the nursing home. Hey, take some interest. Come in the nursing home. I was taking interest. Come on, Sakhi. All your goods are ready. - Then, you read the list, I will check it. - Very well. - Horlicks. - Yes. - Bournvita. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Excuse me. Do you see more Hindi movies? No, why? Because your voice changed from.. Sohrab Modi, to Dilip Kumar to a silent movie era. - Give me the list. You check it. I will read it. - All right. - Horlicks. - Horlicks. - Bournivita. - Yes. - Fruitinex. - Yes. - Aspro. - Aspro. - Anacin. - Benadryl. - Yes. Water based compound. Vimbram. Becosule. Glucose. Oxygen cylinder. Oxygen cylinder. Is the patient very serious? Only the doctor knows it. But right now, I am very serious. - Oh, Good morning, Mr. Rai. - Good morning. All your medicines have been sent to the mental hospital. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Sudhir? - Hey, Hiralal! Are you a doctor of the mental hospital? No. I have become a child specialist. - A doctor for children? - Yes. Then I will need you. Yes, definitely. See, please pack these medicines. We will go in the adjoining Chinese room. Come, I have some work there. Come on. Please parcel some food, please take the order. Waiter, take the order. It is a small place, the food is good here. - Is it? - Very good. Let the menu card be, take the order. Two chicken Manchurian. Two chicken chilly. Two prawns garlic. Two fish garlic. Two vegetable spring rolls. Two crab rolls. Two chicken rolls. And a Chinese chopsuey. That's all. Is this a party or something? What about the party? It is food for two. So many dishes? Where are there so many dishes? Just eight dishes. It is just us two and our eight. Actually, one feels hungrier when one are in love. That means that you have fell in love. But you stay in London, isn't it? Oh, I see. Love in London. No, you don't see. Love in India. After dad expired, I got his settled London business. I just had a house here, which I wanted to sell. Now the Bombay tenant didn't give.. Me the rent for four years. I reached there. And what did I see? It wasn't a male tenant. It was a female tenant. And what a girl! She is a proper dream girl. When I gave her the eviction order in her hands.. Such huge tears fell from her eyes. She held my hand and said.. Where will I go, leaving this house in such a huge world? I decided at that time. Instead of chucking her out of this house.. Why don't I settle my life with her? If she comes to London as Mrs. Hiralal.. I will be able to sell this house.. And settle my house in London too. But, this is a fantastic idea! You are a genius. Thank you. But.. I have a problem. You know that there is a lot of cold in London. And Ruby darling has a permanent cold. What did you say? Ruby.. Ruby Dutt.. I am Hiralal, that means a red diamond. And she is a ruby. Both of us are red diamonds. Her father's was in the army major. Major Dutt. Therefore, her brains were just like army people. She doesn't take the medicines at all. I see.. Just saying I see won't do. You must see her and you must treat her. You are a child specialist, isn't it? You will be able to take care of her. She is a couple of years elder to me. But she is just like a child. That same arrogance.. That same attitude.. You just take the luggage from the seat ahead. - Yes, sir. - Come Sudhir. What is this, darling? I have told you so many times.. You go up from the bed once again? I was taking some brandy. See, who has come. My friend. He has become a big doctor now. Come.. My fiance Ruby! It seems.. we have met somewhere before. I don't think so. Your voice and your face.. It seems so recognized. This happens, darling, this happens. Come on, Sudhir. Have a seat. You sit too, darling. See, darling. We believe in rebirth. It is possible that Sudhir was your.. Brother-in-law in your previous birth too. Why? What do you say to that, Sudhir? Sometimes, when you meet people.. For the first times, we think that.. We don't know since how many years we know them. And then, there are some.. Even when they stay all the life.. They seem strangers. Correct. Very correct. Sudhir.. see if my darling has fever. Let me see your hand. Yes. Her veins are fast. Give her a paper. What will it be if not fast? She doesn't listen to anyone. Didn't I tell you? She is very military minded. Now you have got a correct doctor. He will cure you. Bring this medicine. You people chat. I will return right away. Miss Ruby.. The medicine that Hiralal went to bring.. It won't make any difference to you. Then why did you send him? To have him move away from here. Why? I wanted to ask you some questions. Yes, please do. Hiralal says that you are often sick. I think that.. What do you think? I don't have the guts to say what I think. Then have a brandy. You'll become stronger after a brandy. I don't mind. Yes. So what do you feel? I feel that your illness is related to your mind. - To my mind? - Yes. All of us have a sickness in the mind. Now, look at me. I have got everything. But even then, my mind is moving.. Around, god knows in which thirst. Don't you think so? I will not lie. Even I think so. What I searched forever in my life, I didn't get it. And what I got, I didn't love it. You are right, you are right. See, I was very intelligent in studies. I wished that I should pass, I got the gold medal. I thought that I would buy some Fiat or Ambassador.. I bought a Mercedes. I thought that I would pursue the profession of a doctor. I invested fifty five lakhs and opened a nursing home. And now.. it's cost must be about a crore. But even then.. did my heart get satisfied? No. No? Why? You know, Rubi. Well, with money one can buy.. A Mercedes, a nursing home and everything else. Every luxury of life can be bought. But the heart.. That cannot be bought. At the most, taking hands in hands, the nerves can be seen. See, I returned so soon. Here is the medicine. Here. Take two pills after the food. And don't have anything cold. Another thing. My nursing home has it's opening ceremony tomorrow. I will come to take you personally. Okay. Then bye. We will come on only one condition. Ruby is your responsibility from today. You will have to meet her every day. He is a busy man. He will forget. See Ruby. It is a doctor's job to cure. Whether it is a friend or foe. Bye. Bye. - Shall I drop you? - No. I will go. Is this the time to come? I am very angry with you. Ever since I have become a child specialist.. I am a bit scared of adults. I have got a guest with me. Meet my friend.. Ruby Dutt. He is my partner, Prashant Chaturvedi. Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi. Do you remember Hiralal? The one who was in school with us? - Hiralal Tandon? - Yes. She is his fiance. Oh. Okay. But where is he himself? I am here, I am here. Many happy returns of the day. Just as minute. Meet her first. She is my wife, Kavita. And another thing is, Today isn't my birthday. Is it? Happy birthday. May this day come many times. It isn't her birthday too. Actually, it is the birthday of our nursing home. It had taken birth on this day. Oh, so you two are the fathers. Excuse me. I will keep the flowers at this time. And I will pray to God.. This city gets full of sickness. So that your nursing home gets success. Thank you so much. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. You have come now? I am very angry with you. What can I do? I didn't get a taxi. I am sorry. Nandini.. please have her sit. - Yes. Come. Come. - Yes, darling. You have a seat. I will have a chat with my old friends. - Good evening, good evening. - Good evening, sir. Oh, Good evening, sir. Sir, it was very nice of you to come, sir. Kavita, he is Dr. Agarwal. The biggest heart specialist in our nursing home. Sir, my wife. And meet my wife, Meenaxi. Oh.. Kavita.. you? - How are you? - Renu! Oh, you both know each other? Yes, she is my friend since childhood. - Very good. - Come, sir. I thought that she was his daughter. But she is his wife. And that too, the third. Third? Is he a heart specialist, or a marriage specialist? Thank you very much, doctor. I'll be needed your help. You are most welcome sir. Where? Excuse me. Darling. Your headache is all right, isn't it? - Where do you stay in Mumbai? - Excuse me.. Do you want Vicks? I have Vicks. - Take it. - No, thank you. I was asking you.. Do you want to sit here? Yes. Sit here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Darling, you are happy isn't it? Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't like this party. Because all of you are speaking seriously. And parties are given for fun and fluoric. Therefore, I propose.. That I present a song to you. Yes! Very good. And with that, the one who will sing be will be dance. Dance.. Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi. What insolence is this? Let go of my hand. Let go. Let go! She has abused me saying that I am insolent. Now. I have already had a couple of pegs. If I really flirt with her in the intoxication will I be wrong? No.. not at all.. not at all. If Mrs. Kavita doesn't wish that, forget her. Why don't you sing us a song? Yes. I will sing it. Look, I don't have any tantrums. Please have a seat. I will get ready.. Your Sudhir drank and broke the story. What story? There is something wrong between them. They must be dancing at home like this too. If he did this with me.. I would have whipped him and taught him a lesson. "I am angry on someone for something." "I am alive, but angry with life." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am alive, but angry with life." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am angry on someone for something." "I think that I have complaints against friends." "I think that I have complaints against friends." "I think that I love enemies." "I am angry with this friendship and enmity." "I am angry with this friendship and enmity." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am alive, but angry with life." "I don't know where I see whom?" "I don't know where I see whom?" "But whomever I see whenever.." "They think that I am angry with them." "They think that I am angry with them." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am alive, but angry with life." "I am angry on someone for something." "I am angry on someone for something." Keep the car here. I will return. - Good morning, Miss Malhotra. - Good morning. Is Prashant free? Yes, he is free. Please go. I will go. I will go. First you tell me. How are you? I am all right. - You are all right? - Yes. This means that you are a Malhotra from UP. Definitely not. I am from Punjab. Why? Because you said like this. The people from UP are a bit arrogant.. About their Hindi, which has it's origins in Urdu. It is said that by the time the argument.. About whether the word British is male.. Or female in the court of Wajid Ali Shah.. The britishers had taken over Awadh. But this isn't the case with the Punjabis. Wherever these people stop.. They say all right and move about. As it is, I like the fifty percent Punjabis more. And the rest of them? - The rest of them are males, isn't it? - Yes. I like this fifty percent more. You speak just like children. I am the doctor for children, therefore. - Okay, bye. - Listen. Tell me something. Where did you learn such a nice song from? If you keep meeting me.. You will learn many other talents from me.. Not Miss Malhotra, you can call me Nandini. And my name is Sudhir. Even I have some talents, Mr. Sudhir. Should I show it to you right now? What? You will sing here? In the nursing home? No. I make very nice coffee. Oh God I'm ruined. Why? Coffee is my biggest weakness. Whichever woman wants me.. Can treat me to coffee and win me over. Okay. You meet the doctor. I will try to win you over. Okay. But.. I like sugar. Okay. - Good morning, doctor. - Morning. What happened? Why did you call me all of a sudden? I didn't call you, Kavita has called you. She has called you some ten times since morning. Yes. I have unplugged my telephone. Why? Because I fear your wife. I just held her hand a bit yesterday.. And she has become so angry? Yes, she is very angry. Go and convince her. Why do you have to be so angry in this? No. I will have to tell Prashant to check your blood pressure. The blood pressure will be checked later. First you tell me. Why did you hold my hand and.. Tell me to dance in everyone's presence? You should have told me that you.. Didn't like to hold hands, I would hold your feet. See. Sudhir. There is a limit to jokes too. Mr. Agarwal's wife had come today in the morning. Do you know what Ruby Dutt tell her? What? That you unfolded all the story in your intoxication. Wow.. as if it isn't a story, but some heart. It was broken and there wasn't any sound. Like that.. What was the story? Just that.. You dance with me.. That you have some affair with me. Wow.. The girl seems intelligent. How nicely, she has found out. I am her fan. You will be her fan later. Do you what she said after that? That if you acted like this with her.. She would have whipped and taught you a lesson. A whip? Let me see where Ruby Dutt's whip is? Sudhir Rai is living to search that whip. Hello. You found time to come after so many days? How did Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi give you time? - I was thinking that.. - Enough. Let me talk to. I was thinking that you had forgotten me. This is great. I can forget myself. But Ruby Dutt. Never. I just thought that when Hiralal is not here.. Is it proper for us to meet here? Silent, has Hirala bought me? I am the owner of My decisions. I was thinking that you were angry with me. Otherwise, why didn't you come to meet me for so many days? You are strange too, madam! What do you mean by Madam. Can you call me Ruby? Okay, Ruby.. It was just a matter of yesterday.. Just a day. One day? Do you know how many hours are there in a day? Twenty four. The twenty four hours of wait are bigger than twenty four years. Please forgive me, please forgive me. I agree that I am the guilty. I bow my head and wait for my punishment. Take me in my embrace, that is my punishment. "One day.. I will yearn and clutch my heart.." "One day.. I will yearn and clutch my heart.." "My beloved killer.. I will take your name.." "I will take your name." "I will take your name." "One day.. I will yearn and clutch my heart.." "My beloved killer.. I will take your name.." "I will take your name." "I will take your name." "You woke me up.." "I won't let you sleep." "I won't let you smile or cry." "You woke me up.." "I won't let you sleep." "I won't let you smile or cry." "I will give you some message." "I will take some message." "My beloved killer.. I will take your name.." "I will take your name." "I will take your name." "You wouldn't get my love like this." "You will have to give the price of love." "You wouldn't get my love like this." "You will have to give the price of love." "I will not deal." "I will use my heart to decide." "My beloved killer.. I will take your name.." "I will take your name." "I will take your name." You have a really fantastic sense of humor, Mr. Agarwal. Therefore Julius Caesar has said.. Let me have men around me who are fat. Let me have men around me who are fat. Excuse me. Good evening.. Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. - Thank you for coming. - Congrats. - Thank you very much. I am very much honored that.. You took out time to come in my party. This is great. There is such a huge event in your life today. And I won't come during such a great event? Yes. Not only this, there will be another great event. And you not only have come for that. You have to stay there and do everything. What is that? Operation. Operation? Whose? Ruby's.. she will have a caesarean. Forgive me. It is your engagement today. Have you.. before the engagement? Oh! Doctor.. Nothing to worry about. The key to successful life is planning. See. We are engaged today. In some days, we will be married. In some days, she will conceive. She has an advanced age. And because she is older, she will have a cesarean. And because nobody else does.. A cesarean better than you in this city.. Therefore, you will have to do this operation. - Oh sure.. sure.. - Thank you, doctor. We will have a drink on that. Sawant.. - Drink for the doctor. - On the rocks. Hello. Hello. The teacher hasn't come as yet? Govinda? Yes? Hi.. welcome.. welcome.. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Welcome. - Flower. Thank you. - Please take your seats. - Congratulations. Sudhir didn't come? - He is here.. - Hi! Where is the bride? I mean.. the to be bride. You have a seat, I will come. Ruby.. Ruby.. darling.. Come on. Ruby darling.. come on.. You look so nice, fabulous. Thank you. Now, garland each other. What is the need for that? There is a need for that. It is the done thing. Thank you. Thank you Sudhir, please take your seat. Darling, you speak to them and give him company. I will organize everything. - Sawant? - Yes? Bring four drinks here. What are you doing here? Come on, run away from here! Mr. Hiralal, you are being so excited. Excited? And me? Not at all Come on, please sit. I will tell you about excitement. Hiralal, it is your engagement party. Why don't you put some music or something? Oh of course.. - Abdul. - Yes, sir? - The stereo please. - Yes, sir. Shall we dance? Dr. Agarwal, shall we dance? - Sure! Sure! - Yes. - Come on darling. - Hey! - The light? - Check someone. - Abdul.. Abdul! - Everyone stand where you are. The glasses will break, the plates will break. Where is that whip? - This light had to go today only? - Call someone to see. - Strange. - What happened? - Put the fuse on. - Light has come. - What happened? - The fuse had conked off? - It will not go now? - No, sir. - Now you go. Then come on, we will resume dancing. I will.. Ruby.. Ruby darling.. Ruby.. where did this Ruby go? Ruby.. Ruby darling.. Ruby.. Ruby darling.. Where she has gone? What happened to you? Nothing. I just fainted. Are you all right? - Take me upstairs. - Come on. Ladies and gentlemen.. Please excuse me. Prashant.. just a minute. Sakhi.. hey Sakhi.. I am here. Oh! Are you here? What is the matter? Why did you call me at this unearthly time? Where were you since morning? Did you call me to ask this much? No. I wanted to ask something else too. How did the lights suddenly go in the party yesterday? How will I know that? Am I an electrician? What were you talking with Ruby Dutt's servant? Why did you give him money? Very good, Sakhi.. I must respect you. You must have been in the CBI. You caught Sudhir Rai so well. And I thought that was very smart. Yes, Sakhi.. Honestly.. I had shut the lights off. Why? I wanted to see where Ruby had hidden the whip. Govinda shut the main switch here. And there was darkness here. There was darkness here.. And I took Ruby Dutt in my embrace. Did she not shout? She tried. But I shut her mouth. How? Now, as this riddle. When my hands were full.. How would I have closed her mouth? My mouth was free.. My lips were free. I used them. I took her to the bedroom, thrust her on the bed. And I asked her.. Tell me, where is that Ruby? Apologize.. apologize.. - To whom? - To me. Why from you. Think that I am Ruby Dutt and apologize to me. - And I should ask forgiveness from you? - Yes. Then I will have to commit the mistake.. That I did with Ruby Dutt too. Shame on you, You have become such a disgusting man. You are so lowly now? Ruby Dutt is your friend's fiance. With your friend's to be wife.. I had such faith in you. But you.. You absolutely stunned me. Go away from here. Don't come to me ever again. Okay. I am going, I will never come to you ever again. But before going, I have a request. Come with me. Where? Come. Where have you brought me? This is a mental hospital. Don't ask me anything. Just watch what's happening Brother.. - Yes? - I.. I am Sudhir.. Sudhir.. Sudhir.. Son of that unfortunate school teacher. Your name shouldn't be Sudhir. Your name should have been Adhir. And my name should have been.. Should have been.. 'Gardhab'. Means a 'Donkey'. The same matter once again. - You are so educated and.. - How does education help? How does education help? Nothing. Nothing. The real thing is not education. The real thing is money. Money. Therefore, I was whipped. Therefore, the dog was left on me. Therefore, Ruby Dutt said and everyone agreed. Nobody heard me out. Sudhir.. You don't believe what everyone says? You believe me, isn't it? Yes, brother. Then, why don't you take revenge? I will. I will certainly. Yes. Yes. Take a whip. And hit her back. Like she hit me. She had hit me so hard. I was teaching Ruby Dutt history. History makes the other kings. But emperor Ashoka was one of those kings.. Who themselves make history. Seven the biggest of kings were at his beck and call in his court. How many wives did king Ashok have? - Yes? - Yes? I asked.. How many wives did king Ashok have? I have heard.. The kings and emperors have thousands of keeps? Yes.. I was saying.. About emperor Ashok. Please don't skirt the issue. Tell me. What is the need of concubine when having a wife? The reason is lust. This means, physical desire? Yes. I have heard that this thirst.. Increases, as it is tried to be decreased? You have heard right. So, what is the cure of this non decreasing thirst? By concentrating on something else. And if one cannot concentrate? See, Ruby.. - What's the matter? - It seems there is a worm inside.. - Please open my zip.. - Zip? Why don't you look at me? Do I not seem good? Ruby see.. Should not talk like this. Why are you so arrogant? So many boys run after me. I don't even look at them. I look at you. And you tell me things about Ashoka the great. To hell with Ashoka the Great. Life is little. Listen to me.. listen to me.. - I.. I.. - What is this? See, papa.. he was forcing me.. - You rascal.. how dare you? - No.. no.. Papa.. if you weren't there.. I don't know what would have happened today. Ruby, what are you doing? You wretch.. You forgot your status. Dutt sir, you.. I will not.. Tiger.. - No! - Brother. Who? Sudhir.. Sudhir.. You should avenge me. Avenge me, okay? Avenge me, Sudhir. Avenge me, surely. Please forgive me, Sudhir. Do you know? He has been telling this story to me since fifteen years. You can understand how Ruby Dutt.. Must have tortured him. He speaks of revenge. Sudhir.. Will brother get fifteen years back.. If you take revenge? Forget this revenge. No. Never. In the book of the heart.. Life is avenged by life and dignity by dignity. If anyone snatches anything from me.. I don't rest until I don't ruin them. Ruby Dutt is not my friend's fiance. She is the killer of my brother. If you want to break you relation with me on this.. You are free to do so. Come on, let's go home. Kavita. These are forty thousand rupees, keep them. Where do you get all this money from? Our biggest tragedy is that.. No man is a hero in his wife's eye. Not a single room of our hospital is empty. People book it three months in advance. Why don't you put this money in the bank? What is the need of keeping so much cash at home? I am doing what everyone is. This isn't any new. Keep it. Yes, Ruby.. Darling.. Everything is all right. Come to my house, at seven thirty in the evening.. With just a little bit of your luggage. And then we will go far away to settle away. But remember it today. Exactly at seven thirty. You told me that you will give.. Me such a surprise, my life will change. But I can just see the time changing. Have some patience. My blood pressure increases due to suspense. Everything will be taken care of with the end of this suspense. Really? Shake hands. Not now. Sit quietly now. Where now? This will be the case till my marriage. Do you love her so much? What will you know about love? And that too, love with Ruby? I will take a drop of my heart's blood.. And have Ruby wear a ring on my marriage. Does Ruby love you this much too? Is this to be asked? She says that she cannot tolerate a moment's separation. Is it? Come on. Get ready for the surprise. Hide there. Have you come? Yes, darling, I am ready. Tell me, where will you take me? For the last time, think about it.. You are sure to run away with me forever? How many times should I tell you? I cannot live without you. My present, my future. You are everything. Do you really not love Hiralal? Sudhir.. how can you expect that? Can anyone love a half crazy dull nitwit? Come on. Don't delay any further. I don't have any idea to come with you anywhere. Sudhir. Don't joke now. That mad man can come here searching for us. Hey.. listen.. Why don't you thank me? No, friend. After you showed me the truth of this true love.. I will not want to thank and insult you. Now, I understood all this. Were you playing with me? Then, what did you think? Can only you play with anyone's heart? - You.. - Silent.. Tell me something. Do you know anyone called Adhir Rai? Adhir.. Rai? Yes. Do you remember? I am his younger brother. Do you want to know.. Where he is now? He is in a mad house. Yes. A mad house. And do you know since when? Since the day your father lashed him and got him bitten by mad dogs. Since that day, he is in the mad house. And whenever I went to meet him.. Do you know what he tells me? They saying Sudhir.. Revenge. Revenge. Sudhir.. be sure to take revenge. Okay. Then you took revenge? Yes. Revenge. Now, will you please go away from here? Please! - Dr. Dubey? - Yes? I don't have American degree. But I can tell you. This delivery didn't need a cesarean. This is what I think too. The deliveries taking place in this nursing home.. Ninety percent of them can be normal. I don't know why he does a cesarean without any use? There is a reason. Money. See. A cesarean means fees, and.. Even the fees of staying in the nursing home. That means.. more profit.. This is a very big racket. And now, we can tell this truth.. - Because we are leaving the job here. - What? We had taken a hypocritic oath in medical college. We took an oath of service. But we are not serving here. We are selling our conscience. Selling conscience? What are you talking about? You must be reading.. In the newspapers. Legal abortions take place for eighty-ninety rupees. Then, why do we charge thousands.. For an abortion in the nursing home? This money is taken of helplessness. Unmarried women or married.. Women with affairs give this money. You open the register once and see. How many names and addresses are wrong. And for God's sake. Don't say that Dr. Chaturvedi doesn't know this. - Laxmi.. - Yes? See who it is. - Is madam at home? - She is there. Tell her that Nandini Malhotra has come. Nandini.. please come.. Come.. have a seat. What is the matter? What I was about to tell you.. I was first going to tell you in this letter. Then I thought, I'd talk to you if I meet you. Tell me. You must have seen.. There has been such a progress.. In the nursing home in such a short while. So soon.. how can this progress take place? From where did this money come from? I have written the same thing in the letter.. That Dr. Chaturvedi has wandered.. From the path of both, his profession and his humanity. You have tried to accuse my husband. Do you have any proof for that? The biggest proof is that.. I have come personally to tell this to you. I can tell you the names of two doctors.. Who have resigned for the same reason. I know the names and addresses of some of the girls too. But think about it. The matter which they want to hide.. And therefore come to Neo nursing home.. Why will they tell it to you? But whether you believe it or not. It doesn't make any difference. Who says that it doesn't make any difference? The letter you have written with your own hands.. It will be presented in the case of defamation against you. And you will be lost in the darkness of defamy. I am darkness myself. I don't fear infamy. Because I have tasted it. You must remember. A girl from your college ran away.. With some boy all of a sudden. It was a scandal. That girl.. It is me. Nandini Malhotra. Yes. And the boy was.. The famous playboy Vikram Sarin. I wanted to settle down, become a wife. Become a mother. He made me a mother without making me a wife. I wanted to have that child even then. But what about the wishes and non wishes of a poor girl? A specialist was called upon. He told me that the doctor will just examine you. I was rendered unconscious. When I regained my conscious.. I knew.. My child was killed. I got infamy instead of the child. Therefore, I am not scared of courts. But yes. I am sure. Running such a huge nursing home.. Your husband will not want to be stuck in a scandal. Take this, this is a diary. There is all the story in this diary. There is a lot of injustice in this nursing home. With the names and addresses.. There are some case histories too. Whatever happened with me.. That shouldn't take place with any other girl. Therefore, please look after your husband. You are pure and sinless. I don't want to say anything more than this. - Excuse me, sister. - Yes? My name is Vikram Sarin. And I have an appointment with Dr. Chaturvedi. Kindly let him know that I have come - Please wait. I will find out. - Sure. Good morning sir. There is some Vikram Sarin. He says that he has an appointment. All right, sir. Come. - Go straight up from here. - Thank you. It's okay. May I come in, doctor? Please come, Mr. Sarin. Have a seat. Mr. Sarin. I have looked after your patient. She is pregnant. It is the fifth month. It is too late. I don't want to take the responsibility.. Of the abortion in such a matter. See, doctor. This is the question of my and the girls' family's dignity. The girl is unmarried. If the abortion doesn't take place she will commit suicide. Therefore, the abortion will have to be done. If you don't do it, someone else will. I am, willing to pay your price. What will you take? Five thousand? Ten thousand? Fifteen thousand? Okay. Admit her. Sudhir.. Sudhir.. Nandini.. You here at this time? I am choking here.. take me away from here. What is the matter? I had told you everything about my life. The sin from which I wanted to run away.. It is happening all around me. Please save me with this nursing home.. please! - She is dead. - What? I had told you. There is a danger in this. Here. I will write the death certificate. Burn the dead body immediately. Police? Police? You called the police up? I didn't do anything wrong if I called the police. Sudhir.. The man who committed a murder in my womb.. And rendered my life barren.. That same man murdered another girl today. At the hands of Dr. Chaturvedi. Yes, Dr. Chaturvedi. And he got fifteen thousand for this. I told you earlier. What was happening in this nursing home. I had told Mrs. Kavita too. I gave her a diary. Which had an account of what happened in this nursing home. But even after this, you didn't do anything. That diary, which has the proof.. Of Prashant's guilt, does Kavita have it? Yes. No. We should be having it. And listen.. The abortion file, is that in the hospital too? Yes. We should be having that too. Then, we will have all the clues. Come on. Why are you sitting like this? Are you all right? I just have a head ache. Do you have a fever? No. Didn't I tell you? I just have a head ache. Dr. Chaturvedi. What? How did this happen? Who gave the news? I will come right away. What happened? There is an emergency case. Hello? Neo Nursing home? I am Mrs. Chaturvedi speaking. Can you tell me what the matter is? There was some call. As soon as he heard it, he left the house. Yes, I had called. There is some bad news. There was an operation at six in the evening. The patient died on the operation table. When her family went to the.. Crematorium to perform her last rites.. The police came and confiscated the dead body. They have taken it away for post mortem. Then.. please inform Dr. Sudhir. I tried a lot. But he isn't available. Like that, he knows about the patient dying. Because he came to the nursing home.. Exactly half an hour after that. And God knows where he went with Miss Malhotra after that. Can you tell me.. What the operation was about? I am sorry. Miss Susheela, take this key. And burn that file. Dr. Rai has taken that file, sir. Sudhir? Why did Sudhir take it? When did he take it? He came here half an hour after you left. He went out with Miss Malhotra. He came and went to the office and took the file. Why did you let him take the file? How can I refuse? He is your partner. He has a key to the safe too. Now I understand. Who told the police everything. Hello? Can I speak to Dr. Sudhir Rai of the children's ward? I am here. What is the matter? Why are you staring at me? You don't know? What do I not know? See. Don't joke. You went with Nandini to the nursing home. Okay. You are talking about that case? I can't do anything about it. See. This had to happen one day. Now, Sudhir isn't a small kid. Loss or victory is a part of the battle of life. There is danger in this game. And therefore, I am enjoying playing it. I thought you were our support. Therefore, I have come here. One should use brains in the times of trouble. Please prepare a cup of tea for me. I will think till then. Please go! What are you doing here? - I am searching for that diary. - Which diary? Which has all of Prashant's antics written. About Nandini. Get lost. Don't be adamant. - I want that diary. - I tell you. Get lost! Wow! What a diary. Only proof. You too, Dr. Chaturvedi. I thought that you were god. But today, I found out.. That I am a devil, a demon and a beast? Then don't try to fight this beast. Give me the key to the almirah. I understand today. Why you said it that day.. If anything is stolen from you.. You cannot rest in peace till you don't ruin that. Prashant took you from me. He snatched me from you. Therefore, you have come to avenge, isn't it? Sakhi.. You took so long to understand such a small matter? Even after look at my gaze.. You didn't understand how I yearned not getting you? Couldn't you see your destruction in the fire in those eyes? What kind of a woman are you? You don't have anything as gratitude in you. You have lived on the scrapes of this house. A person's heart melts with tears, Mrs. Chaturvedi. Not beasts. Don't waste these tears. - Dr. Chaturvedi? - Yes? You are under arrest, follow me. Hello? - Mrs. Chaturvedi? - Yes? The police arrested Dr. Chaturvedi right now? Nandini.. - Have you come? Dr. Chaturvedi was.. - Yes. Yes. Prashant was caught. But I can be trapped too. I am a fifty percent partner, isn't it? I don't want any witness of this case to be around. Take these ten thousand rupees and leave Bombay right now. Why? I will not go. I want to see with my own eyes. When the court sentences Dr. Chaturvedi.. How the color of his face changes. You seem very excited. That's bad. That's very bad. I will have to do something so silent you. I will give you this injection. What kind of injection is this? A very normal injection. Without any medicine. There is just some air in it. I will press this against your nerve.. And put a small bubble of air in your body. This bubble will move slowly to your heart. - And then, darkness. - No Sudhir. You will not have any trouble. And there will be no proof against me. Sudhir! What have you come here for now? This body? You? The police left you? Yes. So much happened in so less a time. I was about to confess my crime when.. Sudhir arrived. Modern Jesus Christ. Is ready to carry the burden of the world. Wonderful. Till when will you steal my crime's punishment from me? Enough. I won't become a stair case to heaven any longer. If you want to be punished, commit crimes and be punished. Who are you? You will get my introduction in your old files. Like that, my name is Sudhir Rai. Doctor Sudhir Rai. I am a partner in the nursing home. I am a child specialist. But the bitterness of the poverty.. Still exists on the tip of my tongue. Therefore, to earn money, with the right hand and the left too.. I used to commit illegal abortions without him knowing. As big as the house of the girl.. So huge the fees. The fashion of unwed mothers hasn't started as yet. The girl who died.. I operated on her. Sudhir, what nonsense are you talking? I will not let this happen. This is the case file, with my sign. And this is fifteen thousand rupees. The cost of the death of the girl. - Inspector, it's alie. - I confess to my crime.. And surrender before the law, inspector. The signatures on the Death Certificate.. Those he put on to save my life. Are you aware of the consequences of your confession. I have come prepared. Ten-fifteen years in jail. And when I will be realsed from the jail.. Won't be able to practice medicine. But I shall not let him ride on my shoulder and touch heights. - Sudhir I.. - Shut up! And don't try to be smart. I have lived long enough on your dole for quite long. Now I want to live my own life. May it be the jail. Got it? Officer, may I.. - Talk for two minutes privately? - Sure. But you are under arrest. Thank you. What drama is this? Drama? It's you who are making drama. Since the time you have returned you've started this drama. But you did not give me any part in this drama. But you were not there then. Prashant. Ask for pardon from Sakhi on my behalf. Tell her whatever I did, it was to save the reputation of the house. I took that money and the car forcibly because I didn't want.. That police should get any proof. That's why I also made Nandini flee from Bombay. Prashant, you.. Must be very tired now chasing the money. Go, go home. No. I want to live rest of my life with my soul and my heart. The sin which I committed, I should be punished for it. What could be the bigger punishment from this, Prashant.. That you will never forget this all your life.. That I am paying for your deed. Go. Go home. This way he has repaid his life's entire debt.. But.. What should I do now? What should I do now? Oh God! O God! Sukhi. How beautiful you look in the red bordered white saree. Just like goddess. You have repaid all your debts. With interest.. But I had no debts of anybody on me. Now what should I do? How can I live in that house now? You consider me very close to you, Sakhi, right? You don't know Sudhir.. That how close I consider you, how as my own.. That I myself did not know. So listen to me. If ever in my life I have consider a girl as my own.. If I have highly respected anyone.. Then it's you Sakhi. But you should also know.. The day you will lose Prashant.. That day you'd lose me too. Accepted that Prashant had lost his way.. But wasn't it your fault too? A wife.. Could not you have kept in the binds of your love? If this defeat is that of Prashant than.. It's you defeat too. Our society is such.. Where everything is weight in money. You take him somewhere far, very far from here, Sakhi. Where our this rotten civilization hasn't reached yet. By staying there, he.. He will find himself. Realize himself. He will be fine, Sakhi. And when I will return after ten years form here, then.. Where will I go with such a great burden of stigma? Where will I hide. In this.. Apart form both of you in this world.. Who else do I have? And I wish when I come there.. Then I see that both of you.. Have really made a home our of a home. And what can house be where.. Where you can't hear the laughter of some child. Can't hear child's cry. Mother. Mother. Mother. Maa! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom.. Yes, I'm here, son. Mom, dad says we'll go to town. And from there we'll bring back, uncle. Yes, son. Mom, you'll teach me airplane, won't you? When grow up, I will become a pilot. Look, my child. When your uncle arrives.. You observer him and be like him. Okay?
