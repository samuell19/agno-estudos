- What now? What game should we play? - Let's play... Hide and seek. Count to 20, then come and find me. No peeking. Don't forget, no peeking. - I never forget. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... - Dad? - Death is coming. - What now!? - Huh? - What now? What game should we play? What now? What game should we play? - Let's play... Hide and seek. - You hide. - Count to 20, then come and find me. No peeking. Don't forget, no peeking. - I never forget. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... - The lights in this place suck. - Yeah, mum's been moaning about them lights for ages. Ow... - You okay? - No, my head hurts. - Let's hope it doesn't turn into anything. - Yeah. Ugh, what does he want? - Who? - Simon Goodman, over there. - Nope, doesn't register. - I dunno, there's something about him. I think it's in the blood. His uncle gives me the creeps. - Hi, Claire. Where's bubs? - Michael... She's sleeping. - Oh, I was hoping to play peek-a-boo. We could play peek-a-boo. - The kids need me there. - Shame, 'cause I need you too. I'll leave you to it, then. - Simon Goodman! If you see Joe, tell him he should be here, helping. - If I see him. - Tell him to stop wallowing and do something for the community. And while you're at it, you should think about it too. You should be helping people less fortunate than yourselves. - Well I live here too, I mean could it be any worse? - Yes, it could. Look, I'm going to the supermarket in a minute. Tell Joe to come there. Pete should be there already if he knows what's good for him. - Hey, Rosie! I had a dream. - That's nice, Simon. - You're in it. No, no, nothing like that. Um, you were fighting monsters. The Brute. The Brute's a nasty, scary piece of work. I mean you were every match for him up until-- - Did you wet the bed? Is that what you're trying to tell me? - No, no, no. Look, here. Joe drew those, I wrote it. - Take it Michael's still hanging around like a bad smell? - He's okay. - Okay? If I were you, I'd pack my bags and get as far away from him as possible. - Are you sure you're not the girl of my dreams? - Only if your dreams tell the truth. Think fast. Anyway, I'm sure I'll see you around. Say hi to your mum for me and enjoy your package. - What!? This is so cool! - If it's porn, I don't want to know. - Can we not at least be friends? You used to like me a lot. - Past tense, Michael. - You should move forward Rosie. - Save that for someone who gives a shit. I know you Michael. - But you do give a shit. I know you Rosie. - I had a crush on you, and you took advantage of me and Claire. You make me sick. Stay away. - I thought you might've changed your feelings towards me. You've always preferred the older man. - Drop dead. - Rosie, you act like you're this angel, but we both know you aren't. I'll see you around, just for that constant reminder. Oh, say hi to Frank for me. - Oh, you okay? - I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy. Gotta get down to the supermarket before the big woods party tonight. Joining us Simon? See you later. - What did you say to her? - Huh? - Claire. What did you say? - Nothing, she just... - Stop writing about us. Stop. I'm heading into town, you coming? - No, I feel sick. I might just have a little lay down. I think it's those lights. - I'll be at the diner if you change your mind. - Okay... - Oh God no... - Hello? Is this real? - This floor is special. - Who lives here. - You can, if you wish. There's plenty of room here. And there. That's why the lights flicker, Jenny. - When do I move in? - You already have. - Death is coming. Death is coming. Die, Scouts. Rot, rot, rot in hell. - Brilliant. - Oi. - Hold on, I'll be up in a second. What are you doing? - Pooh sticks. - Don't you need water for that to work? - What? - Never mind, I'm surprised you even know. Feast your eyes on this. - Real comic books... - They're really good, too. - Oh. Cheers, thanks. - Well yeah, I mean the only thing that's missing is the subplot where I take over the world. - What? You gave me no more room. - You managed to get Annie, Beth, even my mum. - Your mum's cool. - So you made her a monster? Weirdo... - Only character you'd give me to play with, and I hate playing with myself. - You two finished making out yet? - Pack it in, Pete. Just 'cause you can't do this. - You turned mum into a killer axe woman. Nice! - Where's your shadow? - My what? - Annie? - Hey, Annie? So... You and Annie. - Yeah, going to the cafe, then we're gonna go help out with the Scouts, you? - No, we aren't. We got bigger fish to fry. - Good. Don't want you two cramping my style. You two, welcome to each other. - Maybe we should help. - Maybe we shouldn't. Just go and talk to her. - I talk to her everyday, man. - Ah, you're a dope. - You're a dick! She's with Pete. - "You're a dick." Whatever, Joe. - Look. Annie's happy. I'm not about to change that. - Change that? You're the one that wanted to make her a homicidal maniac. - Look, I only draw what you give me. - Alright, so that wasn't you saying, "I want to draw Beth as a cute girl?" or "I wanna make Annie a homicidal maniac?" And, "I wanna make my mum--" - And Georgie-- - "Monsters." Where you going, Joe? - Going to the cafe to see Beth. Maybe get a milkshake as well. - I'm seriously gonna have to rethink our friendship. - Vanilla milkshake. - That's what I'm afraid of! Blandness rules, just like this town. Going nowhere. - Death is coming. - Charlie? - You going to Scouts tonight? - Yeah, where's your beret? - I don't wear Scouts hats. - Oh yeah you do. We all wear scouts hats! You have to. - I'm too cool for that. - Oh, too cool for that, yeah? - Don't wanna mess this hair up. - Aww. - Aww. - It's already a bit... - Everything okay, Simon? - Mum! You gave me a heart attack, shit... - Enough of your swearing, Simon. Why aren't you sitting with your friends? - I have no friends. - Well there's Joe. - Mum, why do you always insist on me hanging around with your cases? - Joe's a lovely guy. - Yeah, he draws, I write. We tolerate. - 11:30. - But that's not fair! - I'm not having this conversation again. - Well you said-- - Uph. Hi Joe. - Hi Ms. Archer. Hi Beth. It's Joe? I sat behind you in English. - That's nice for you. - Well me and Simon, we... - So? - Well, you're in it. So, I kinda thought maybe you wanted to take a look. - Who's this? - Some loser. - Dad. Might wanna take a read of this at some point. Help start conversations. - So, feeling any better? - Has anyone ever told you that you are really hot? - Jenny! - Well he is. Too hot for you. - Mum, I'm writing! - No you're not. You're avoiding making friends with people. - Well that's my choice! - Good choice, Simon. You'll go far with that attitude. - Well I like being alone, alright? With my thoughts. My notebook. It beats that lot any day. - The Scouts are at the supermarket. Why don't you go and-- - I'd rather die. - I thought you wanted to join? - Till I found out this town wore berets. - Simon, go and do something useful. You know this town has had it hard. Some people more than others. And remember, home early tonight. - Home? We don't have a home, mum. We live in a shitty B&B. I don't even have my own room, it's embarrassing. - Alright, for that you can help me in the woods tonight. - What? - I'm helping, and your attitude can help too. - Uncle Mike was asking for you earlier. - Michael? What does he want? - I don't know, he's your family too. - Don't remind me. Uncle Mike is not your father Simon, he can't hurt you. He's a... He's a good guy. - Since when do you change your tune? - Sorry? - A good guy? Two words: Richard Goodman. - What's got into you, Jenny? Come on. Move Simon. - What is it with you and that camera? - What, so you can write more into those pages about me? Joe's sweet, too sweet to be taken advantage of. - You think-- - Aren't you? - Joe needs all the friends he can get, and he doesn't need a tease. - Yeah Pete, that's hilarious. - Thought so. - Hannah? - You okay Joe? - Oh, you know... - Anything I can help you with? Ah! - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I think so. Ah! Just, just hang on a minute. Ah... - Finish it, before I do. - But I've already got one. - Simon, wait up! - You've got some good stuff, Dad. Mind if I borrow? - Si! - Don't need this one anymore. - Alright. - This comic book's just the start, you know. - Is it? It is? - This town needs a... Needs a scare. Needs a bit of fame, a bit of notoriety, you know? Think we're gonna be the guys to do it. - I guess. - Don't guess. Know! Look, if you want girls to notice you, they will. And if you... If you seriously want to be taken out the shadow of your dad, you will. - What? From a comic book? - Absolutely. - So, uh... You writing more? - I am writing more. - Count to 20, then come and find me. No peeking. Don't forget, no peeking. - I never forget. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... - Annie. Peace? - Simon. Die? - What's this all about Annie? - You don't know me, yet you write me like you do. - It wasn't just me, I mean Joe's-- - Don't blame Joe, he's just following your lead. You're out for one person: yourself. - Well now who's making assumptions? - Maybe I just woke up this morning with a little bit of clarity. - Oh yeah? Well about you Ms. High and Mighty? You must know how Joe feels. Look. This is fiction. Joe's real. - Ugh, what do you want? Weirdo. You and Joe Harper take weirdness to a whole new level. - Annie? - Not now Claire. - Not now what? - All I was gonna say is... Oh, it doesn't matter. - What? - Why are you messing around with others when you clearly love Joe? - Why are you messing around with a douchebag like Michael? - He's the father of my baby. - Yeah, well mistakes can be rectified. - Annie!? - Lost someone? It's always horrible, but more so when you know them. You look like you need it. On the house. Or rather, on me. My daughter's your age. Sorry... I'll let you drink your coffee. Look at me, burdening you with all my sadness. It's just you remind me of her, before she got in with that crowd. - She's louder. - That she is. You know her? - A little. Everyone knows everyone a little. - It's been so long since someone's spoken to me about her. She seems boy crazy these days. On and off with Jason. I swear, those two are a disaster waiting to happen. I hope she'll meet someone new. I love her. And I think she knows, but... I don't say it enough. - I find love in my photographs. A daughter should always remember her mother's smile. And when she can't... You know it's time to let go. - Thank you... For making me smile. - Everything okay? - Um... Do you remember mum? How she died? - She was sick. It was a long time ago. I was young, it was all very sudden. Is everything okay, Annie? You seem distracted. - I, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, and I'll be at the woods later. Want to be a better auntie and all that. - I thought you didn't want to be seen dead with me. You're family, of course I wouldn't want to be seen dead with you. - Count to 20, then come and find me. - One... Two... Three... Four... Five... - Leave my family alone. Leave this town alone. - Mum wasn't kidding when she said there were gonna be Scouts here. I'm starting to feel a bit queasy. Yeah, keep your head down and we might actually make this out alive. - Simon, Joe? - Mum! What you doing, you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Helping? Come on, Joe. Joining in? Come on. - Brilliant. - Georgie, um... Frank went that way. - Frank... - Oh God... - Where did you sleep last night? - In the car. - Might be an idea not to drink in front of the kids. - What difference it gonna make, Georgie? - You make it really difficult to like you. Look Frank, I don't know how much longer I can go on with this. - I thought we called it a day a long time ago. - I saw a man worth knowing once. This town was right about you. - Well you push everyone away, Georgie. - I don't have time for this right now. - Dad! - They'll always been a need for us Scouts. Even if it is for clearing up the mess we make. Joe, you've been here like what? One minute? - Oh, I'm sorry. - We can all be a bit clumsy sometimes, just you more than most. You can still make a difference this weekend, though. We can do with someone with your "stature." - I don't much like for woods. - The woods love you though, Joe. And if you don't come, other people won't want to come. People always look to the tall guy. Don't they Beth? - Absolutely. - We'll see you down there. - Step up to the plate Joe. You might win me. - That was really funny. Just like the comic book... - Don't you ever stop? The only thing I've seen you do the past couple of days is write, write, write. Thought you were possessed of something. - Maybe-- - Come to me. - I can rewrite The Brute. Make him good. - Come to the water. - Or you could write a hot girl, on the beach, giving me the eye. - I'm serious, Pete. If my writing's coming to life, that'll be the last thing I write. 'Cause it looks like I've died and gone to heaven. - I don't think that's a good idea, Pete. - What's the worst that can happen? She turns me down? - Hey Si - Shh... Shit, run! - Die... - Mum, I need to talk to you. - Not now, Simon. - But mum, this is important. - Simon, no! - Georgie, I've got something to tell you. It's about Pete. - I don't want to hear it Joe. You two are always at each other. I'm sick of it. The sooner you and your dad... - But Pete's just-- - Look, the Scout party starts in one hour, and I expect to see you there, Joe. It's your duty. - Simon, listen. Look, I know Michael isn't one of your favorites, but there's no need to be rude. - I'm not, I wasn't. I just... I just needed... Look, we've just seen Pete. - What? - We saw him die. - Simon, Joe, what are you talking about? - Charlie killed him. - You're not making sense, who's Charlie? - It's Charlie, from our comic book. - It's coming true. - Not funny Simon. - Mum, it's the truth! I'm not making this up. - Oh, that's enough! I'm not having it anymore. I'm gonna go home, and get changed, and we're gonna help in the woods and you can stop making stories and come with me. - No one's gonna believe us. - Well we're gonna need to make 'em believe us. - And how are we supposed to do that? - Well you're the writer, you need to stop this before anything else happens. Well, change something. Alright well, you coming? - In a moment. - Well I'll be at the diner, okay? - What are you doing here Hannah? - Checking up on my investment. Are you embarrassed to be seen with me Simon? Didn't I get you what you wanted? - Not here. - Am I your sordid little secret already Simon? Didn't you like your gift? - I'm a little bit preoccupied right now. One of my comic book creations killed Pete and no one believes me. - That sounds really dumb Simon. I wouldn't go spreading that about. - Who are you, Hannah? - A friend, and you seem like you need all the friends you can get at the moment. Stick with me and this is only the beginning. With your words and my personal touch, we can be unstoppable. In return, all I want is what you promised me. - Death is coming. - Oi! - Mr. Harper. - It's time you and I had a little chat, don't you Simon? - No, I'm quite busy actually. I'm heading over Joe's later. We're gonna discuss some new ideas for a comic. - You stay away from Joe, otherwise there won't be a later. You and him are a bad idea together. You're a match made in hell. - Don't mean to rude Mr. Harper, but I've had enough drunks like you in my time. - I have my reasons. - Every drunk says that. - What did she promise you? - Who? - Her! The brunette. Hannah. You know exactly who and what I mean. - Seriously, back off! - Hannah is dangerous. You must have nothing to do with her, because if you do, she'll creep into your veins like a disease and destroy everything around you. I know. - And what do you know!? - I know her. I made a comic too, and I made a promise. You see those? Your father wrote those, and I drew the pictures. Pretty good, huh? Like father and son. Only things started to go wrong... Richard went wrong. He wrote things in a book and things... Bad things started to happen. It was Hannah. She'll promise you the earth and then she'll destroy you while you stand around and look just as she did your father! - My dad was a drunk. - Listen, only to forget! - Get off me! - Simon, if you have that book you best give it to me! - Everything I write is coming to life. - It's begun. It's Hannah, she'll do that. Oh God. - Pete is dead... Me and Joe saw it and no one believes us. - Listen, you're gonna help this old man stop this before others die. Are you with me? Okay, we need to get Joe. Where is he? - In the diner. - Right, we need to get him now! - Beth. - Mum. - How's the Helping the Community drive going? - Slow. - Helping people isn't a quick fix. - I'm thinking of helping someone. - Helping someone, or using someone? - I'm hurt you would think such a thing. But you know me too well. - Beth... - Hey Joe. - So do you really think we can stop 'em? - I don't know, kid. - Well fill me with confidence, Frank. - Well let's put it this way: if your mother doesn't turn into a monster, and Georgie an axe wielding, homicidal maniac, we'll be fine. - Well what if they do turn? - "Rosie seems pretty hot now she's moved beyond pimples. "Shame Rosie won't make it." - Rosie... - It's happening again. - I know, Hannah's back. - How!? I thought Richard was the end of it all. - The kids, Simon and Joe. Somehow things aren't at an end. - "The Brute is coming?" Snatchy. - This is just like last time. - Look, there's still a chance. We just have to get to them before they get to the boys. - Georgie? - No, lost that battle ages ago. - You've got to get her back. - It's not gonna happen Rosie! - "Don't worry about her, she'll find mum, talk to her "about impending monstrous condition?" I'm not going to grumble about lack of credit for my character ideas. Charlie in particular, nice characterizations. I couldn't have done better myself. Blood on your hands? See, I would be a great writer. - Then there's no chance. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. We still have a chance. - If you tell anyone about me, about us, I might be forced to renegotiate our arrangement. - Frank, Rosie-- - We just have to get Hannah. - ... they already know. - So they die? - No. - Your mum then? Michael seems pretty keen on her. Maybe we can write them a romance. After all, the Brute is a thinly veiled father figure. It's all in the book, it can be rewritten, but not erased. So choices, choices. Finish the book, fill it with your imagination and our arrangement is complete. You can go the rest of the time knowing you made a girl and her family very happy. Don't, and I'll have to step in and complete it. - You said they'd go to a better place. Claire, Annie, the baby. You said they'd all go to a better place, away from here. Away from Michael. - Aww, sweetie. Such sentiment, and everyone hates you still. Don't worry, finish the book and I assure you they'll go to a better place. But for now, I hope you're enjoying your comic book wishes coming true. Just wait till you get to page 21. - What do you mean? Oh shit... - Rosie... - Just stay away from me! - You can't do this alone. - Well how do I stop all this? There is no stopping it, is there!? My mum's in danger! - There's only one way to stop this... And that's to become part of it. Rosie? If anything should happen to me, just promise me one thing. - Why? - I need the promise. - I guess. - Promise me Hannah doesn't win. - Please... Please help. So cold. - Dad, are you okay? Dad! Dad? Dad, stop! What are you-- - It's been a while, Frank. Isn't it about time you hand me what you promised? - I won't let you. This town won't let you. - That's not a very nice way to say hi to an old friend, an old lover... - You and I were never lovers. - You loved everything I gave you, but you tried to cheat me. These rooms should've housed you, your family. - Leave my family alone. Leave this town alone. - You don't cheat me and get away with it. I'm getting there earlier this time. I see a baby, innocence. - Stay away from her, you monster! - I'm not the only monster around here Frank. You've neglected those close to you, and they've grown bitter and twisted. They're like wild animals waiting for a word. This word: Kill. ♪ If you go down to the woods today ♪ ♪ You better go in disguise For I'll be waiting, the Brute will be waiting. We want you all to suffer, especially your kids. - I'm so sorry Claire. I'm so sorry. So sorry. - Can someone tell me, please, what's going on? - Can you handle it without the drink Dad? - Hello? What the hell is going on? - Hell is going on.... And hell wants your baby. - Mum! - What's happening? - Me? - What? - And this. - Where did you get that? - It was there. I thought it would help with my writing, but I was wrong. Mum, help me! - I can't. - Mum! - Rot, rot, rot in hell. Death is coming. Die... - This isn't the Beth I drew. - Excuse me? - Oh, never mind, never mind... - Shh... - Someone's going for it. - I've faked better. - Joe? - Aww Joe, sweetie, we need to party. Annie, is it? - Annie... - Joe, I'm beginning to like you more. Joe, come back here! Don't expect me to wait for you! - I hate this town! - Annie... - I thought you were different. But you're just as bad as the rest of them and I'm a fool for thinking otherwise. - Annie, come on. - I see you everyday, Joe. Every day I try to tell you. - Tell me what? - That you deserve so much better than me. - What? - This looks like the perfect spot for a retreat this weekend. Let's just check it meets the standards. What about Claire? - Claire who? - I hope she can see this. - Why? - It would've killed her. - I'm so glad I met you. Your family's given me so much joy over the years. I feel special to have been part of your lives. Now if you could just move a little bit more... And I think we're there. This is funny, right? - This is so funny. - Run, Simon. - You're no Richard, but you'll do for the Brute. - Who are you? - Death, and I need some company. - Go, destroy, everyone. Don't be late to the party now Frank. - Run! - Let go, I need to stop this. - You are this, Annie. She wants Claire and the baby. Look, I thought we'd be safe. I thought they'd be a way for us Goodman's, but I've failed. - Not yet. - Come on, scream or something. - Rosie!? Rosie, there's a monster! - Finally, no time. Take this. - What? - No time, gotta go. Look after the baby! - Rosie! Great... - Rosie-- - Baby's fine. - Okay, come on. - Maybe we're too late. - Maybe. - Maybe not for everyone. You might have been trying to protect us all these years Frank, but I'm a big girl now and I want to hit some people really hard. The stench is this way. The last thing it's doing is having my baby. - Where's my end of the bargain, Simon!? Simon, do you like what you've done? - No. - But you've made so many people happy by wanting everyone dead. - Who have I made happy? - Now that would be telling. So, where's Annie? Where's Claire? Where's my lovely baby? - If I tell you, will you let me live? - Of course. - What about mum? - Your mum's going through some changes. She'll have to work those out herself. In the meantime, you can live with me, carry on your dad's good work in that little black book, which I'll take now. For safe keeping. - Die, bitch! - You can't kill something dead unless already dead yourself. Want to even the score? You're the one that can't let go of the past. I can't wait to strip everything from you. - Shh... Or he'll hear you... - Sorry. Alright, you alright? Hi. Oh, thanks. Nope, nope. Not doing this. - Joe! Michael? - Come on, move, now! - Run! - You go that way Rosie. I'm gonna stay here. - No, I don't want to, I want to go-- - Go! - Hey Joe. - Hi Rosie. - Run! Move you beret wearing idiot! Annie... - Claire, no! - Say peek-a-boo one more time, I dare you. - Rosie! Get outta there! - Only the beginning, Frank. - Thank God. Mum! - Death is coming. - Nooooo! - Wait, or she'll hear... - It won't work with her. - What now? What now? What game should we play? - Let's play... - Hide and seek. - I'm gonna shoot you Simon. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Yay, I got him! - You don't know me, yet you write me like you do. Stop writing about us, stop. - What now? - Kill me. - What? - Kill me! - I... I can't... - Do it Annie! - What now? What game should we play? - End this! - Let's play... - I'm gonna shoot you Simon! - Kill me! - Get away! Get away! - Kill them all! - No! - No! - You don't cheat me and get away with it. I'm getting there earlier this time. - Let go, I need to stop this. - You are this, Annie. - I see a baby, innocence.

Something bit me, it hurts... I need a coat. Your coat... Damn it Joe, where are you!? Joe, Joe, Joe. I would never have drawn it like that. - Eve? Eve...
