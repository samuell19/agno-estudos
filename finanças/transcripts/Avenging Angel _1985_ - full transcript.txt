Well, I think that Terry is gonna be rich someday. Oh yeah? Why's that? Because every time I come down here, he's always working. Terry doesn't know about my past. I haven't told anyone. Well, why should you? C'mon, Angel's dead and gone. You've got a whole new life ahead of you. You know, when I was hustlin' the streets, I hated cops. Even you. And now because of you, I'm gonna be a lawyer. Listen, Molly, I gotta tell you, I'm very proud of you. Four years of college in three is not bad. Now listen, this thing with Terry now, is this serious? I like him. Yeah? C'mon. I like him a lot. Okay, well, look, just, don't rush into things now because you know, you're gonna be meeting a lot of nice fellas up the road here. Andrews, the philosopher cop.

Mr. Larson admits that he knew Ms. Matthews and was outside of her apartment the night that she was criminally assaulted. Is that true, Mr. Larson? Let the records show, Mr. Larson nodded his head in ascent. Your witness, please, Mr. McCloud. Mr. Larson, you live in Los Angeles, am I correct? Yes, yes, I do. And that is approximately 30 miles from Judy Matthews' apartment. That's right. Do you often come to this neighborhood? No, no, not often. Well then, tell me what prevailed upon you to travel 30 miles distance to Judy Matthew's neighborhood so late in the evening. Was it to see a movie? Or perhaps legitimate theater? Or maybe you just wanted to buy a pack of smokes. It's all there, Mr. Gerrard. She named names, including our man in the police department. Oh, it is all here. Jesus, if this got out, they'd shrink assholes from here to Chicago. You did a good job, Ray. Oh yeah, my ol' man is gonna be very pleased. There may be complications. Yeah. When we hit that second cop, there was this freaky looking guy, he had this glitter shit all over him. He got caught in the crossfire. No telling what he saw. Look, what we don't need is a bigger body count, huh. Mr. Gerrard, nobody gives a damn about a street freak. You know, I almost got him on the way there. Mmmm. I know you hate speeches, Andrews, but I'm gonna get those bastards, so help me God. Isn't he cute? I think there's enough to go around. Oh, well, I'd like to go around the world. How much will 50 bucks get me? Loads, baby. And now, for the most famous and spectacular trick in all of Yoyodom. Do you know rocking the cradle? Do I know rocking the cradle? Ma'am, I invented that trick, but I won't be doing it tonight because the baby in the cradle is doing his act at the other end of the boulevard. However, I will be doing... Walking the dog? Ah, yes, but as you can see, the dog just died. Aww! Well, believe it or not, folks, that's the grand finale. Remember, donations accepted, absolutely nothing rejected, thank you very much. Thank you. Yo yo. Ma'am. You don't remember me? Angel? My god, I can't believe it, it is you! You look terrific. You're so different. You look great. You look great too. Oh, you know me. I can't complain. I make a living. I wake up in the morning. You've changed. But for the better. I'm glad you got out when you did. What's happened to the boulevard, Yo Yo? I mean, things have changed. Places are being boarded up. Property's being sold. I saw Rita hustling in George's. He never would've allowed that to happen before. Well, that's because George don't own it anymore. There's a lot of changes going on, and some people call it progress. Who's she? Oh, that's Cindy. She came in from Omaha. Is she new to the streets? She's been here about three weeks. She can't be over 13. Some things never change, do they? Hey, have you see Solly? No! Well, let's go. All right. Can you believe it, that hearse belongs to Sol. Oh yeah? Don't tell me, she got it from an ex-tenant. Yeah, just like everything else she owns. In here. Wow, this is Solly's all right. Yeehaw! Come on, come on, this is gonna be great. She won't even recognize you. She's gonna have a heart attack. It's been four years. Come on, it's all right. Look out when she turns around, this is gonna be hysterical. Solly. What? Is that any way to treat an old friend? I don't believe it. I'm gonna have a heart attack! Dolly, how the fuck are you? What are you doin' here, you little shit? You're not walkin' the streets, are you? I told you never to come back to this town. Aww, man! Look what you've done now! You woke up the fucking baby, you pervert. I'm coming, Dolly, yes. Yes. Oh, no, you don't want to cry. You miss your Solly? Come on. Oh, yeah. Yes, don't you cry now, no. Congratulations, Solly. I didn't know. It ain't mine, for Christ's sakes. Oh, she's adorable. Yeah, but it ain't a she, it's a he. I don't know, Solly. He looks kinda like you. Ah, bullshit. Where'd you find him, Solly? Oh, this little hooker I knew. She owed me seven months back rent. So she split and leaves me this kid. They found her body. Behind the alley a week ago. Can you imagine me a mother? At my fucking age? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna get rid of the little bastard, that's what. 'Cause he's a pain in my ass. I know a guy on welfare. He can help you. You touch that phone and I'll break your dick. Oh no. I'm gonna find the right place for him. I guess you heard about Andrew's death. Yeah, and he was murdered. I thought maybe you would've heard something on the streets about who shot him. Not a thing. I heard some talk about Johnny Glitter. He was supposed to be around when Andrew was shot. We can check it out, but nobody's seen him around since. Where can I find him? He works on the streets. He could be anywhere. I know who we need, Kit Carson! He knows more about these streets than anybody. You haven't heard, have you? Oh no. No, he's not dead. Worse. Worse? Can I help you? We're here to pick up the body, sir. Body? What body? I don't know anything about any body. William Cornwald. He called himself Kit Carson. Oh, him. I didn't know he died. It happened very suddenly. Oh. Well, there's nothing down here about it. You're making it awful hard on the widow Cornwald, sir. Lady, it's okay, Lady. Go 'head, Lady. Go 'head. I'll lift the barrier. Thank you, sir. Asshole. I'm gonna take this hallway, and you take that hallway. We'll meet later. Okay. Whoever finds him, take him to the hearse, and we'll meet there. All right, good luck. How ya doin'? Howdy, partner. Remember me? Is that you, Angel? Oh, good god almighty. What are you doing here? Why, I don't know, Angel. I don't think I'm supposed to be here. It's so good to see you, Angel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. J Wing. Well, someone's pulling your leg, deary. Nobody dies on this floor unless they check with me first. You can bet your liver I'll look into it. Bush, Charlie, let's go. What the hell's she up to now? I don't know, she's probably gonna lobotomize some poor sucker. Who knows, in this loony bin, anything could happen. By God, Angel, I feel plumb naked without my shootin' irons. Oh, hey, let me show you something. Remember this here? Lieutenant Andrews deputized me. Can't wait to see him. He's dead, Kit. Damn shame. He was a good man. He was murdered. What, who in the hell would do a terrible thing like that? That's what we're gonna find out. Word on the street is Johnny Glitter saw the whole thing. Do you know? Know him? Sure I know him. Funny little fella, throwing that sparkly stuff all over. Can you find him. You darn tootin'. Now let's ride. Solly, solly. I can't find the old fart. Who you calling old fart? Is that you, Solly? Who do ya think it is, you senile old bastard? Same old Solly. Let's get out of here. Excuse me, sweetheart, has the number five bus come by here yet? Not yet, Sam, another 10 minutes. Oh thanks, Kit. Noon in the high sierra. There they are. Nurse, you, nurse! Now we're in deep shit. You're not supposed to be here. Where are you going? Oh. Get him. Faster, faster! Where are you going? Where are you going? Right now. You're not supposed to be here. Wheee! Yahoo! Where the fuck are you going? Watch it! Come on, come on, after them. Stop, stop! Move it, Yo Yo. You've got it. Piss off. Solly, come on! I think you've gone about it the wrong way. That can't be the way to change a diaper. Why not? He'll be peein' backwards. How do you pee backwards? Easy, you have the stovepipe pointed in the wrong direction. Oh my god, what a night. My dogs are killin' me. Where's my little boy, yoohoo? Dolly! What are you doin' to that kid. You're gonna give him a complex. Yes! Yes. Hey, where'd you find that little mustang? I want you to meet my babysitters, Pat and Mike. This is Kit and Angel. How do you do, ladies? Hi, Cowboy. Fellas. Say, let me hold him. All right, now, don't break him, ya old fart. That's it, that's it, fine little mustang. Sure gonna be hard to break. Look at them eyes, yes-sir-ee, that's character. Say, why don't you call him Little Buck, after Buck Jr. They used to double 'em back in the '30s. Oh! All right, now, don't drop him, don't drop him. What in the hell. Did I ever tell you about the time I delivered triplets? I was all by myself at Buster Browns up in Bosler, Montana. That was back in the winter, Good God almighty, the little sidewinder peed all over me. Yeah, all this little bronco needs is some play time. Here you go, honey. Look what I got for you. Look here. There you go, Buck. How do you like that. Isn't that fun? It's pretty, huh? Isn't it pretty? My golly, look at you. Goodness sakes alive, look at that little Buck there. By golly. Hey! Well? What are you, workin' the streets again? Yeah, I am. I can find out a lot more on the street as Angel than I can as Molly. Right, Kit. Makes sense to me. I liked your old warehouse, Kit. I did too, but they tore it down to make room for one of them high rise condos. They sure know how to ruin a good view. Hell, places like this here ain't easy to come by, Angel. Especially if you don't want to pay any rent. Well, what do you think? I think it's wonderful. Well, c'mon in, come in. This is great. Oh, gosh, if I ever need a decorator, I guess I'll know who to call, won't I? It's surprising what you can do with a few pieces of old movie sets. Right there's my favorite, right there. Of course, every time I look at it, it makes me thirsty. Well, it sure is nice to be home, yes sir. Well, looks like I have to do some tidying up. Here, I'll help. What happened here, anyway? Well, you don't think I was gonna let them take me to the loony bin without a fight, did you? Damn bushwhackers. Snuck up on me in the middle of the night, they did. You know, it's awfully hard to fight with your long johns on and your tallywhacker hangin' out. Excuse me, Angel. Anyway, the next thing I knew, I was in a padded cell and that funny little lawyer of mine, he was spendin' all my money. Didn't they have a court order or a search warrant or anything? They didn't have nothin' but their fists. I sure don't wanna go back there again. You won't have to, Kit. I'm filing a restraining order to keep them from taking you back. You can do that, Angel? I can and I will. Well, damn, I almost forgot what I came here for. Come on over here and give me a hand. You wanna pick this right up. There we are. Let me see about my hog legs, here. Yes-sir-ee. It's still working good. Yeah. There we go. Yes, sir. This here, live ammunition. No, they won't let me walk around the boulevard with loaded guns, what they don't know won't hurt 'em. We run into them coyotes that killed poor Lieutenant Andrews we're gonna need the real McCoy. Now, I got me a surprise. That's a snake eye derringer. Got it from OI' Bat Masterson, just before he retired. You can have it. Good God Almighty. You know I just love convertibles. Well, that's nice. Look, we're looking for this street freak. He's lit up like Christmas tree. The name's Johnny Glitter. He's got this sparkle crap all over him. Look, honey, I'm not the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. I don't give nothing away for free. What, what? Chinatown. Try Chinatown. Chinatown. You have some. You assholes! You goddamn dirty shitheads! His name is Prince Charming. Oh, and this guy spent months trying to find her. He went from flophouse to flophouse, from breadline to soup kitchen to no avail. This prince had one hell of a time trying to find him, but through it all, he never gave up. He was determined to find the woman that fit into this glass slipper. And this woman, lemme tell you guys, was the most gorgeous, most delicious woman that he had ever seen. I mean, I am talking beauty here. I am talkin' that she is absolutely luscious. She was kind of like Bette Midler. For Christ sake, that's no way to treat good booze. Where's your registry book? Who the hell registers? This ain't the Plaza. What in the hell do you guys want? A guy name Glitter flop here? You must be fuckin' nuts. People in this place ain't got no names. My friend asked you a question. He's upstairs. Well, this is where Johnny Glitter used to bunk. Let's go. Get him up. Hey, mister. You seen a fella named Johnny Glitter? Johnny Glitter, oh yeah. He's upstairs. Oh, and so are four of the meanest sons of bitches you ever saw. You fuckin' cockroaches. Go on, move it. That Glitter son of a bitch has to be around here somewhere. Come on, let's check upstairs. Kit, look. Hey, you got anymore shells for that thing. Oh. Angel, I taught you how to use a shootin' iron. You ever shoot one of them? Just point and pull the trigger. You got it partner, now let's go. Where is that bastard? Where's Glitter? Come on, wake up. Get up! Let's go! Glitter, glitter, that's a start. Tell Ray where the fuck you are. Fuck, brush your teeth. Go! Go, go, you fuckin' Cockroaches! Hi, Kit. Excuse me. Hey listen, excuse me, guys. Look, you've got the wrong guy. You want Stan the stardust man. I sell daydreams. Is this the guy? Bingo. Hey, come on now fellas. Come on, listen, you got me mixed up with somebody else. I'm Johnny Glitter. I spread happiness and joy. I'm you're sunshine, man. You see? Smiles by the miles. Don't anybody move. Go 'head and hide. Take cover, Angel. Got one of 'em. I could swear one of those guys was fuckin' cowboy. You're crazy, Teddy, those guys are pros. She's reloading, get her. Come on, let's get out of here. Well, howdy, Johnny. Kit, Kit, are they gone? Yep. Are you sure they're gone? I'm pretty sure, yep. I want you to meet my friend Angel here. Hi, Johnny. Hi, Angel. Are you all right, Johnny? Who, me? Yeah, sure, I'm fine. Well, listen, thanks for everything. I'll be seeing you, Kit. Hold on there, Johnny. Where do you think you're headed? I'm about to catch the fastest bus out of town. Come on now, Johnny. We need your help, don't we, Angel. We sure do, Johnny. I guess I owe you one. That'a boy, Johnny. That'a boy. I knew his heart pumped more than just shit. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it, that's him. That's it, you've got it, my god. You're very good. You ain't no Picasso, but you're very good. That's him. I think I know this guy. He came in here with a gorilla the size of a meat locker. Pushed me around a little. Why? He wanted to buy the place, but I told him I didn't own it. Yeah, well he don't look like no real estate man I ever saw. Unless they were planning to bury some guy under a house. Come on, guys, let's go. Kit, find Yo Yo, tell him there's gonna be a meeting tonight at Solly's, okay? Yeah. Johnny, spread the word. I want everybody there. Oh good. I love parties. Hey Angel, Angel, where you going? I've got some studying to do. I'll see you later, okay? I'll catch up with you later. Damn, that girl picks the funniest times to do her school work. Excuse me, Miss. I'd like a replicate of all property transactions on Hollywood Boulevard from December of '83 to January of '85. Yes, yes, I'd be delighted to accept. It's an honor. Yes, we'll do that soon. My regards to your lovely wife. Can you beat that? Jenny, pencil in the 26th, the Chamber of Commerce dinner in my honor. Man of the year. How 'bout that. Thank you, Jenny. Two of our fuckin' men wasted, and you don't know who did it? Well, they came out of nowhere. They disappeared without a trace. I don't believe it. When I was running the show in Kansas City, this kind of thing never happened. You think somebody's movin' in on us? Ray thinks they're pros. Epstein. It's that Hebe from Jersey. It's gotta be Epstein. Listen, if I was in business with you, everything would've been fine. Now, Angel, has something to say, and I want you all to listen real good. I'm looking for Andrew's killer. You have to protect your businesses. If we work together, we can help each other. I checked out a few things in the Hall of Records, and discovered some very interesting facts. For the last 18 months, 87 transactions, over worth of Boulevard real estate has changed hands. There's nothing wrong with buying property. Oh, yes there is. If you force people to sell or kill them if they don't. That's right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Who's behind all this, Angel? I don't know. But it's clear to me that someone is out to takeover the Boulevard Vice. Hold it, hey, wait. Let's face it, there's a lot of money in Vice. I think that Lieutenant Andrews and Janie Sun Li found out about the scheme and were killed because of it. Just like them damn land barrens used to do when I was a kid. We think we've identified one of Andrew's killers. How do you know? If anybody sees this man, don't do anything rash. Contact me, Kit, or Johnny. Hello, baby, my name is Studs, what's yours? Come on, baby, don't be like that. You like to party? How would you like to make my day? I'm on a lunch break. Kinda horny, aren't you? You can tell, eh? Mm hmm. One more word, and I'll blow your balls into outer space. All right, all right. Bang, bang. Well, I see you haven't lost your touch. Hold it, honey, you're not going anywhere. Get your hands off. No, you've made a mistake! I'll have you up on charges. Hey Eddie, this bimbo is gonna have us up on charges. Hey folks. Spending the night in the slammer ain't no reason for doom or gloom. I got a pocketful of dreams. Here, officer, grab one. Grab that dingbat, too. Yeah, what dingbat? Where in tarnation did that girl go to? Hey Angel. Can you believe this shit? This is my third bust this week. I mean I'm not crap. I make a lot of money for that guy, you know. And I only get his damn answering machine. Not much fun, is it? I've never been busted before. Yeah, well, you better get used to it if you plan on staying in this line of business. Ever thought about going home? Yeah. My father would really love that. At least on the streets I get paid for it. Got any other relatives? Someone who can look after you. I've got an older sister in Tucson. I don't see what the problem is. All right, we've got 22 fish in the tank. Officer, Sergeant, Sergeant. And an authorized signature. May I have a word with you, please? Sergeant Baylor, there's been a terrible mistake. The mistake, baby, is that you got busted. Tell it to your attorney. Sergeant Baylor, your department is in violation of due process. Article one, section seven of the California constitution. Not to mention, the Civil Rights Act. Under California Civil Code, section 11115, article 4, and, under California penal codes section 146, you personally, and your captain, are legally liable for false arrest. She's right. We owe this young lady an apology. Get her release papers ready. Harry, we picked her up in a routine sweep. I'm aware of our procedures, Sergeant. Yes, sir. Whatever you say, Sir. Would you mind telling me what the hell you think you're doing? What does it look like I'm doing? You know damn well what I mean. Sketches of suspects and alleged killings. Agitating people in the streets. Sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong. If you were doing your job, I wouldn't have to. Don't you dare tell me my job. I'm conducting an investigation. I don't have to answer to you. You think Andrews would approve of what you're doing? Am I free to leave? He was my friend too. Am I free to leave? Yes, but, don't forget what I told you. Keep your nose out of police business. Is that clear? Yes, sir. You arrested a 13 year old girl in your vice sweep. A minor. She doesn't belong in a tank full of street whores. She doesn't belong in the streets, either. Will you help her? She'll only wind up back in the streets. But you will try. Hey Debbie, come over. Well, hello. It's party time. Oh yeah? How much? The three of us, around the world in 80 days, 500 bucks. That's my lucky number. Are you sure this is Debbie's trick crib? Well, that's what Shopping Cart Sally told me. Shares it with a couple of young ladies. Heard some wild stories about what goes on in there too. Johnny, you stay here. Kit and I will check it out. All right. If you see, Andrew's killer, if you even think you see Andrew's killer, you honk that horn, okay? Okay, yeah, yeah, okay. Hey, I'm you're sunshine man, Angel. I won't let you down. Please, Mister. Now! I've never done anything like that before. Bitch, what do you think I'm paying you for. Move it, get over there. Do it, and you're gonna like it. Please, I can't. Geeze, Ray, take it easy. She's only a kid. Only a kid? Only a kid? How would like your fucking head caved in? We've gotta do something, Kit. You're right, Angel. You stand right here. She doesn't want to! I'll do it. - You ready? I'm making a citizen's arrest. Get the girl, Angel, get her. Get out of here. Fucking cowboy! Oops! Angel, head to high ground, I'll meet you outside. Down there, down there. Jesus, what was that. Oh! It's all set. You're going to Tucson. Here's your ticket. You talked to my sister. Uh huh. She wants me to come stay with her? That's what she says. She sends her love, and she'll pick you up at the airport. That's nice, Angel, real nice. How can I ever thank you? Easy. Don't come back. LAX, see to it that she gets on the plane. You bet, lady. A hooker, a drugstore cowboy, and a Jewish dyke? That's the powerful organization we were worried about? There's no mistake. We've checked it out. Now, why in the fuck would three misfits like this have a hard on for us, can you answer that? Dad... Can you answer that? Please! Can you answer that? It turns out that Andrew's was a hooker's guardian. The hooker's guardian? Yeah. That's it? That's the reason they're all over our ass? Yes, that's it. I want them taken care of. All right. All right Angel. Hey, Angel. Angel. Hey, Angel. Molly. Molly Stewart. Captain Maradian would like to see you. Little early, isn't it, Sergeant Baylor? You know cops never sleep. C'mon, get in. We had a break in the Andrews' case. So, you were a friend of Andrews, huh? That's right. Hear he took you off the streets. Paid your way through college. I bet you were real grateful to him for that. What are you trying to say, Sergeant? Hey, don't get so touchy. I just thought it was a real nice thing for him to do, that's all. Yeah, it was. He was a good cop. A good cop. Too bad he put his nose in where it didn't belong. I thought that's what good cops were supposed to do. Good cops. Get out. C'mon, c'mon, get out. You know, honey, you made some friends of mine very unhappy. Son of a bitch. Jesus Christ, Harry. You didn't have to do that. I'm afraid I did, Hal. You used me for bait. I'm doing my job. Look, why don't we two help each other. We don't know know who Baylor was working for. Well, Janie Sun Li knew, she had proof, before she could pass it on to Andrews, they were both killed. But I promise you one thing, Angel, whoever did it, I'll get him. If you don't, I will. You were too young to remember what it was like when I worked for the organization. It's all changed, world's changed, Miles. Let's have a drink. Each one of those pins is and annuity for you, kid. Can't tell you the potential of Hollywood Boulevard. We'll name one of those movie theaters after your mother, may her soul rest in peace. Commercial possibilities are unlimited, and I'm not gonna lose it because of some goddamn ragtag band of piss ant vigilantes. Yes? They got Baylor. This time I'll take care of it personally. Can you believe it? I have to testify on Maradian's behalf. I think you owed it to him, Angel, after all, he saved your life. Look! The car behind us. It looks like the one I saw the night that Andrew's was killed. Look, and they're shooting at us. Look out! We'll get killed! Where's that box I put back here a couple of days ago? Go Johnny, go. I'm going as fast as this crate will carry us. Duke Wayne gave me this because I rode shotgun for him in a stagecoach. Who cares, you dumb fuck, will it shoot? Who you callin' a dumb fuck? You're damn right it'll shoot. Now open that back door, and I'll show you some shootin'. Oh shit! Turn around, go back! Dag-gummit, sure is a bad time for a blow out. Where's your jack, Angel, I can fix it. Are you out of your fucking mind? Come on, let's go that way. Run! Come on, Kit. Move it, ya dipshit. Better hurry, they'll be doubling back any minute. They behind us? It's dark in here. It's a fucking dead end, now what are we gonna do? We're sitting ducks! Well, now I know how Custer felt. Here, Angel, load up. Way to leave my hanging. These things ain't loaded. Get behind those dumpsters. Hey, sonny, now just might who you be? They've got Miles. You think Little Buck's gonna like this? Sure, why not? Do you think it's his color? Which one? Really. Where are they? We wouldn't tell you if we knew. Get out of here before we call the cops. Hey! Coochie-coo. Hey! Oooh. Hey, what a cute baby! Tight lipped fella, ain't he? Can't get a word out of him. What do you expect from a guy who wears earrings? C'mon, guys. We don't have a choice. We have to call the police. No, I say sling him up. That'll make him talk. When are you gonna join the 20th Century, you old coot? I think you're right. We should hand him over to the police. Good. I'll call Maradian. Watch it! Look out, he's got a gun! Ease off the gun, cowboy. Move, move! You, behind the couch, up, you rag tag band of piss ant vigilantes. Who do you think you're fucking with? Isn't anybody gonna answer the phone? What do you want? Oh, it's for you, honey. Me? Hello? Yes. Yes. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yes. I understand. It's a man named Arthur Gerrard. He's got Little Buck. He wants to trade him for his son. Him. Gerrard said we're supposed to wait right here until they arrive. You get just as close to Little Buck as you can. You jam that wheelchair right into ol' Gerrard's nuts, grab Little Buck, and run like hell, cause that's when I'm gonna commence shooting. You all right, Miles? We're ready. Then let's do it. That's a fucking bullet hole. No! I've got the baby! I've got the baby! I've got the baby! Solly, cover the other end. Gerrard's making a break for it. Cover me. Son of a bitch! Hey guys, I've been shot! Medic! Medic! You're the only one left, Gerrard. Move! Drop the gun. Who do you think you're messing with, hooker? Throw that gun down before I drop him. You know I'll do it. Now, kick it over here. You've got the gun, put the baby down. Little Buck! Move and I'll blow your brains out. Buck! You'll never make it! Little Buck! Little Buck! Oh! Gimme that kid, before you drop him, you wonderful, senile, old bastard. Wyatt Earp couldn't have done any better. Shucks, Angel.
