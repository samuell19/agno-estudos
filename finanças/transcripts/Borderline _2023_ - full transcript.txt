- It was terrible. You know, I started getting all this mail and comments. - Because it was posted on Facebook? - Yes. About two years later. - Who was it? - I don't know, I never found out. - Well it's a fantastic exhibition, isn't it? - I think it was really great what she did. - Great. Well maybe, it's also a bit of a cliche. Taking off her clothes, what did she think would happen? - What? Ugh. I can't talk to you. - Excuse me, but do you have a cigarette? - The start of so many stories. - Thanks. - Not a problem. - So what do you think of the show? - Predictable. - The show or my question? Oh, thanks. - De rien. - So, are you an artist? - Hi Mads. - Oh my god. - Great you could make it! - It's nothing. - What are you doing here? - I'm over for work. - Wow, great. - How do you two know each other? - We met in Coffee at Brick lane right? - Yeah, four years ago, right? - You don't live in London? - I live in Copenhagen. What a fantastic show. - Do you like it? Thanks, that's so nice to hear. - Yeah, I thought it was terrific really. - Thanks, that's so sweet. So have you two met? - But without the formal pleasure. - Mads, Joan, Joan, Mads. - She just gave me a cigarette. - Beware of smoking women. - Always. - Hey Rasha, come. - Excuse me. - So what brings you to London Mads? - Business meetings. - Business? What kind of business? - You'll laugh. - I never laugh. - Okay, I work in social media. - Mm, how so? - Targeted promotions, corporate identity and Facebook pages. - Mm, fascinating. - Well, what do you do? - I'm an editor. - What kind of editor? - A vicious one. - Okay guys, they're going to Nakh Bakas in a few moments so drink up and come to the pub. - This is a kind of zombie pub. - Yeah, pubs in London are often quite joyless. - It's carefully cultivated. Joy isn't allowed. Tell me something you wrote. - In the baths of serenity, all difference dissolves. - Is that a poem? - It's a slogan for a brand of a bubble bath. I didn't use that one. - Moving. - Is that a joint? London looks so different. - It's the boom. - Why do they build such terrible buildings here? - To oppress us. You see that? - I love that. - Yeah. Hidden city. - So what are these things that you edit? - Various items. Newsletters for one, anthropological investigations. - And you publish them? - When the mood takes me. - Hmm. - What about you? - You mean artistically? - Yeah. - I'm a failed poet. - Failure for poets is success. - I guess there's no success like failure. - Tell me a poem. - Okay. - I'm waiting. - Yeah. Okay. Look me in the eye was engine many times before will be again connected perfectly in fact, across the silence of their separation as if this routine had a soundtrack and I'm a silhouette and you're a synapse firing in space. - Not bad. - Where can I find your stuff? - On the net. - Oh, very professional. - Hashtag. So this is where they store you. Nice. Very clean and postmodern. - Business comfort in the capital of Europe. - Is that another one of yours? - An unknown colleague. - Anonymous. Sexy. Like you. - Listen, before we have sex. - Don't have sex with me. - I need to tell you that I have a girlfriend. - How nice of you to tell me. - When was I supposed to tell you? - I don't know, before. - Before what? - Earlier. - Earlier when? Listen, we don't have to do anything, but we can if you want. - What if I don't want to? - Mm, that's not a problem either. - What about your girlfriend? - What about her? - Doesn't she care? - We have an open relationship. - Oh really? - Yes, we're progressive. - That's not funny. - It's a little funny. - You brought me here. - I didn't force you. - Under false pretenses. - You said that you wanted to see my hotel room. - Yeah, but I obviously didn't wanna see your hotel room. - And how am I supposed to know that? - Are you retarded? - So I have to tell you, what else should I do? - You could have told me before. - I didn't know that we will be here before. What was I supposed to say? Hi, my name is Mads, I have a girlfriend? - Can you smoke in here? - Out the window. Confusing times. - Are you confused? - Isn't everybody? - Not me. - No? - Nope. I'm just myself. - And who's that? - It's who you are and what you stop believing about yourself doesn't go away. - I don't quite follow. - It's what you talk about to avoid talking about. Do you know what I mean? It's... Nevermind. - Hey. Hey. Good morning. - Did you want me to leave? - Oh, you can stay. - Really? - Yeah, we can get breakfast. I just have to catch a plane later. - Almost like you're a gentleman. - Let me just take a shower first. "Hope all is good in London. Looking forward to seeing you later - a xx" Hey. - Do you mind? It's just for my private collection. - Just don't put it online. - Of course not. What do you take me for. Do you mind if I join you? - Sure. - Too much? - No, it's fine. - Steamy. - Which way? - That way. - You're like a child. - I'm exactly like a child. - Where do you live? - Holburn. - Central? - Very. - Is it expensive? - Well, I live with my parents. - And what do they do? - Mainly, they're dicks. - Dicks? - No, not really. They're just boomers. - I've seen that meme. - It's like they never really grew up. - Your parents? - Everyone's, they were brainwashed by watching too much TV. - Yeah. And now it's now our turn. - Yeah except now it's Facehook, Instascam and Shitter. - So why were you together for so long if you didn't like him? - I don't know really. I guess I kind of got used to it. - Inertia? - Yeah, but I don't think I was ever really in love with him - Never? - I don't think he ever really got me, my weird side. Like you, my dear. - Right. - What about your girlfriend then? - Anna? - Mm. - She's compassionate and she's also good for me. - But she doesn't get you either. - Well, we come from different worlds. - What does she do? - She's a doctor. - Mommy GF. - What? - People have stupid ideas about women. - Do they? - Mh-hm. - Who does? - Everyone. About what women want. Men especially. - And what do women want? - They don't want pussies. Why do you think some things happen? - What do you mean? In a mystical kind of way? - No, just like why some things happen and some things don't. - Random chaos. - Yeah, but it's not all chaos is it? Like, why do you think nothing happened with that girl? - Who? - The girl that you took to the monument. My precursor. - She wasn't your precursor. - Oh, I forgot. I'm unique. How old is Anna? - 33. - Have you previously been in a relationship with an older lady? - Yeah, my first girlfriend. - Mm, why didn't that work out? - I don't know. Some things just don't work out. - You do know though. - What do you think about relationships? What kind of relationship is it possible for two individuals to have? - What do you mean? - There are many kinds of relationships. You have business relationships. You have social relationships. - Except that when you're in a sexual relationship with someone, it's like being in 10 relationships with 'em at once. I came here with Gino. - With Gino? - Yeah. He was in hospital. It was just before he died. - What did he die of? - Bowel cancer. - Oh Jesus. - Yeah. I remember I came to take him out for a walk and he threw his colostomy bag over his arm like a cape. - Wow. - I thought it was one of the most dashing things I've ever seen. - Was he important to you? - Yeah, he published my first book. - You wrote a book? - I wrote a couple. - I thought you said you were an editor. - Yeah. - So you are a writer? - I do all sorts of things. - Hmm. - So what does your girlfriend make of all this? Does she see other people? - She has before. I mean, it also has to do with how we got together. - And how was that? - Casually. - And now? - I don't think so. But to be honest, I don't really ask her. - So how together are you? Tell me another poem. - Swallow me, I will live inside your belly. Floating in a sea of just because repeat this sentence after me all I wanted was. So, we are back here. - Time is a flat circle. - I've heard that before somewhere. - Yeah, it's from the internet. - Right. So I guess this is it. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. I mean, you are one of the most interesting people I've encountered for a while. - I'm glad I entertained you. - You want to swap numbers or Facebook? Maybe we could meet next time I come to London. Or you could visit Copenhagen sometime. - Yeah, I'd like that. Joan Deray. - Until next time then. "Joan Deray has sent you a friend request." "Confirm" "Friends" Hi. Hi. Hi. Come. - How was the trip? - It was fine. - Hi. - Hi. - What are we having? - We're having Spaghetti alla Putanesca. - Mmm. - Have a taste. - It's good. How was Kirkegaard? - He was so good. We went for a long walk today. Who is it? - The internet. - Joan, do you want to watch "Quiz Time?" - I'm working here. - Mmm. It tastes great. - Tell me about London. You never replied to my message. - My phone died. But you know what it's like. - What is it like? - It's like a drug. - Then it's a bit strange you didn't check it. - Do you have any, by the way? - You mean weed? I thought you quit. - I had a mini relapse. - In London? - Hmm. - I thought they all just did cocaine over there. - I believe this is just a myth. - I don't have any. And anyway, I'm on call later. - When? - In a couple of hours. - Hmm. - You know that thing we talked about the other day. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes, what were you going to say? - Who is that? - Just someone on Facebook. I'll turn it off. - Thank you. - I'm going out. - Where are you going? - Out, out, I'm just going out. - Joan's got a booty call. - I do not have a booty call. - She does, you can tell. - I wish I had a booty call. - Don't be vulgar. - It's ironic. - Apartheid. - Ms. Joan Deray. - The one and only. - Thanks for coming out. - It's okay. I was just Facebook stalking my new boyfriend. - Who's your new boyfriend? - Mads. Mads by name, Mads by nature. No, he's not actually mad. He's actually quite normal. He's Danish. - And he's your boyfriend? - Yeah, the only problem is he lives in Copenhagen. So what are you doing in London? - Flying the coop. - A relationship needs to move forward or it sinks. - But why does it have to keep moving in a specific direction? - Biology. Time. - Time doesn't say we have to make a bourgeois family. - Time says I must find a suitable mate before I become reproductively obsolete. - Time says the sun, the planets and the universe will disintegrate into pure zero. - Exactly, Mads. - What happened? - Grew apart. - So what's your plan? - I don't know, what's your plan? - I told you. - Yeah, Mads from Norway. Do you know where I can get some coke? - Denmark and yeah, probably. - Should we get some? I've got some money. - Where are you staying? - I was about to ask. - I'm living with my parents. - Just for tonight, and then we can spend the hotel money on coke. - You're incorrigible. - Last orders. - Shall we get one more round then? - Do you really want another one? - I want a baby, Mads. - Yes, I hear you. - Every time I see my parents they ask when I'm going to have a baby. - I just told you I'll think about it. What do you want to do now? - Go in and fuck. - Only if it's okay, though. - Yeah, it's fine. - Should we get some vodka? - Yeah. - Where are you going? - To the hospital. - Oh. - Okay, take off your shoes, hurry. Shush. Fuck! Make yourself at home. - Yeah, thanks. God Joan, you're obsessed. - I'm sorry for having a life. - A life? I feel like I need to get fucked. - Carrie. - Mh-hm. - Strike a pose. - You sending my nudes to your boyfriend? - You love it. Mads is taking me to Copenhagen. - Coping mechanism. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - I'm kidding, Joan. I'm just kidding. - You can talk. - I'm an aesthete. - Is that what you call it? - Hmm. Perfectly comfortable with my choice of lifestyle. - Really? - In the future, we will all be insane. "Update on the Atheist brief. Can you stop by the office ASAP - L" "Missed call" - There was something twisted in his thinking, don't you think? - Yes, but it's true what he explained about serotonin and communication. - Is it? - Yes, about the way electronic language short circuits people's reward receptors, which then affects the rest of life. - What are you talking about? - Social media. - Mental illness. - I think I've read that book. - Mads. Sorry for the wait. - It's fine. - Come over. - Thanks. - Welcome back. - Thanks. - London. How was it? - Big. - A big shithole, huh? Anyway, I've just been chatting with Atheist. - What did they say? - We're in. Good work, Mads. - Great. - Which means we need you to go back. - Okay. When? - Early tomorrow if that can work? - Fantastic. - Super. Any questions? You can just ask Jens. He's got all the details. Great stuff, Mads. Good luck. - Thanks. - Who are you, Nan Goldin? - Man Deray. You love it. - I do, I can't deny it. - I've been out clubbing for five days straight to do this research of bringing these tunes and I'm telling you, when I looked myself in the mirror when I woke up about 10 minutes ago, I got exhausted just using my eyes mate, for real. Anyhow, any who. So what have we got for you today? - Do you ever get off that thing? - Okay, okay, okay. I'm putting it away. - I haven't seen you in two years. - What's two years? - Two summers and two winters. You should be paying attention to me. - You're such a narcissist. - Says the queen of borderline. - Hey. - I'm just telling it like it is. - Are you gonna get that? - What's the point? - Faithless generation, unhappy life. - So I guess this is goodbye then. I'll leave you to your enterprise. - Fly away to new adventures. - Mesmerized. - And Joan, take care of yourself. - Don't I always? - Do you? - More or less. - Satan 2.0. - Will you shut the fuck up? - Never change Joan. - You can carry on. - Of this city, not one stone will remain standing. Not one stone. - Mads? Mads? Wow. You haven't done that for a while. - Like a comet falls in love with earth. - Pretty. Shall we go? - Like a bullet makes an exit. - Friends! Come in! Just dump your coats on the bed. - Sorry, is someone sleeping in there? - Are you okay? - Are you sure? - Dump your coats. - Lucas. - Yeah? - Would you like to...? - Yeah, yeah. Just a second. - Hi dad. - Hi Joan. - I'm ready to go home. - Where is everyone? - The theater. - Okay, cool. - Joan? - No, it wasn't because I could only think of him but because of her. - What are you talking about? - Ah, Lucas. - Can we hug? May I hold you? - Yeah, yeah. - No, because by showing it, you're promoting it. - So we should only give platforms to nice things? - Sorry to interrupt. Lukas says he has some ketamine. - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, have you done this before? - No. - Yes. - Yes? - You want to go first? - Let's go into the bedroom. - Okay. - I see stars. - I have a role to play. - Entities. So pretty. - They don't want them to be different. - Let's make a baby. - A baby? - Yeah. Come on. Can't you see? - Wait. - Okay, so this is a story about balance and control. Hey. - What? I'm just pleased to see you. - Yeah. So how have you been? - Feels like I just saw you yesterday. - Yeah. Right, so where do you wanna go today? - That way. - Yeah, your wish is my command. I don't know, to be honest. I have my doubts. - About what? - About what I'm doing. My position in the vast machine. - What is your position in the vast machine? - I don't really know. Artisan, maybe peasant. - Well, most people are peasants. Most of what people complain about too, being peasants. - How do you get out? - You have to never be in. - Too late. - You could drop out. - Ah, you just drop into something else. - I saw my friend, Carrie. - How was she? - She left her husband. - Oh, why? - She was bored. Girls get bored. Maybe we should try and find a place to be inside. - Let's walk for a bit. - When do you leave? - We have some time. - You don't want to? - Is that what you want? - I don't care. Why would I? - I don't know. About what? - About whatever. About whatever this was, which I realize now is nothing. - What do you mean? - Isn't it? - I thought we were friends. - Friends? - Aren't we though? Well, what are we? - Well, like I said. - We can do whatever we want, okay? - So easy for you, isn't it? - What is? - Just whatever. It's whatever it is you do on social media. - What are you talking about? - You know perfectly well. - Was I disrespectful? - You're disrespecting me right now. - How? - As a woman. - Right, so? - So what? - You're not under any obligation. - I know that. Why would you even say that? Why don't we just go to the desert? Don't laugh. Have you ever been? - No. - With the Bedouins, we can just jump on a plane and in a couple of hours we're on a different planet. - But we'll have to come back. - Why? - Because of our lives. - What life? You don't have a life. - Right. - Do you? Aren't you just some social media robot? - You tell me. - Do you wanna go to the pub and fuck in the toilets? - What? - Come on. - No. - You're so gay. - Right. - Aren't you? If you weren't gay, you'd fuck me. - Would I? - Your testosterone would make you. - Great. - You don't think that's true? - Since when? - I don't know. I don't know what happened. - I've gotta go back to Copenhagen now, Joan. - Do not pass, go. Asshole. - You don't even wanna say goodbye in a good way? - What difference does it make? - I think there is a difference. I really appreciated meeting you. - Well, you're half gone already, basically. - Well, that's up to you. - Don't go yet. - Well, I've gotta go soon. - Okay, but just have one more cigarette with me. I don't know what I'm doing to be honest. What I'm doing wrong. - It doesn't seem that way. - I'm 35 and I'm living with my parents. - You're an artist. - Yeah, a piss artist. - That's something to be. - Thanks Faceberg. - Okay. - Do you know how my parents talk to me? - How? - You are selfish and ungrateful. You take us for granted and you never clean up. You're wasting your life. You think the sun shines out of every one of your orifices. - Wow. - I don't know why I'm telling you this. It's just giving you an example of the kind of thing they say. - It's cruel. - They don't really get me, you know? They think it helps, but it doesn't help. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - I know. Joan. - What? - You're not alone. Can I help you? - I was looking for Daniel. - He moved out in April. - Okay. Hi. - Hey, welcome home. - Thanks. - How was London? - Fine. I'm going to take a quick shower. - Okay. - Did you have a good day at work? - It was fine. We had a stabbing. - Was that nice? - So nice. - What do you want to do tonight? - Um, I don't know. We can watch a film, if you like? - What do you want to see? - Perhaps a thriller? - Get some water. I'll find something. - Have you seen 'Fatal Attraction'? "Lives in NoHopenhagen" "From Liarville" "BLOCK" "Choose a problem to continue" - Everything okay? - Yeah. Everything's fine. - Fuck! Dad, I need to borrow your credit card. - It's in my wallet. Why? - How come she gets to borrow your credit card? - Shut it. - Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. - Hi. - How's it going, big guy? - It's going good. - All cool? - Yes, all is cool. What are you talking about? - Mads. Can you come in? How did it go? - I presented what we talked about the idea of creating more engagement through their... - Did they bite? - It's hard to say. I couldn't really tell, but... "United Kingdom" Sorry. - So? - I pitched the whole concept for them.... - Do you need to take that? - I'll call them back. I'm sorry for this. - Hello? - Hi. - Who is this? - It's me, Joan. - Joan? - I'm in Copenhagen. - What? What are you doing here? - I thought you'd be pleased. - Joan, do you remember our last conversation? - Yeah, but don't worry about that. - Did you delete that profile? - Look, nobody knows it's you apart from us. - How would you like it if the roles were reversed? - I'd be thrilled. - Please just delete it. - Okay, okay, I'll do it. So when are we gonna meet? - I'm at work right now. - No, I understand. We don't need to meet right now, obviously. - Where are you staying? - Well, I thought I'd stay with you. - Are you crazy? I live with my girlfriend. I thought we said goodbye in London. - What? - I said goodbye, we said goodbye. - No, you said come to Copenhagen. - When did I say that? - You said it twice. - I didn't mean like this. - I need to see you. - I don't think we should see each other. - How can you say that? - What else can I say? - Fuck you Mads. - What? - Fuck you. You lying cunt. - What did I do? - You know what you did. - What do you mean? - You lied to me. - I never lied. - Yes you did. You know you did. - Okay, I don't think this is going anywhere good. - Fucking prick. - I'm gonna hang up now, okay? I'm sorry. I thought things were clear between us. - You're a fucking asshole. - Goodbye Joan, I hope you find some peace. - Mads. Mads. Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck! Do you have a phone charger? - No, I don't have a phone charger. - Do you have a phone charger? - What kind of charger? No. - Who do you want to call? - There's something strange in the neighborhood. - Who are you guys? The house band? - Where are you from? Dachau? - London. - What are you doing here? - I'm visiting my fucking boyfriend. - Will you give her a drink? - What kind of drink do you want? - A martini. - We don't have that. - He's not a fascist. Well, not really. - So what about this tweet? - Please consider me an incompetent child without any responsibility for my actions. The work of feminism is almost done. - What about it? - He's right wing. He's anti-feminist. - But can't you see this inability to separate aesthetic from ethic, reality from fantasy, what you think you want, from what you really want. - So where is your boyfriend? - He's at work. - What's his job? - He's a fucking faggot like you two. - Is that right? - Yeah. No? - You've got a big mouth for a little girl. - My finest feature. Don't laugh. You couldn't handle it. - You don't think so, princess? - But that depends on how you frame the situation. If you start from that premise, then of course you end with that conclusion. - What premise? - That humans don't somehow belong to nature. - How much money do you have? - How much money do you have? - How much does he have? - Okay, who wants to go first? - Me. - Do we fuck her, or what? - Yeah. But just let her suck me off first. - What do you think, Mads? - What about? - Man's eternal enemy. - Women? - Feminism. - I really couldn't say. - Do you wanna get fucked? What? Did I say something funny? - Yeah. - Well, what do you want? - I want you to hit me. If you wanna fuck me, you've gotta hit me. - Is that the best you've got? - Where are you going? - I'll see you later. - What the fuck are you waiting for, you prick? Are you a fucking faggot? What's wrong with you? Are you a little gay mummies boy? I said hit me. Come on, hit me. - Put your hands against the wall. - Put on a condom. - Shut up. - Yeah. Yes. - Come on, you fucking asshole. Come on! Fuck me. This is all you've got? Come on. - Mads. Can we have a chat? - That was Atheist just now on the phone. - Yes? - And... What can I say? I really appreciate the work you put into this. You should know that I don't have anything to do with this. But it's out of my hands. It's just in these times. - What's going on? - Atheist... They're freaking out, which means I need to pull you off the project, Mads. You're really skilled and a great talent so I'm sure you'll land on your feet. - Lars, what are you talking about? - Do you know a woman called Joan Deray? - What the fuck are you looking at? Can I have another one for the road? I need to go to a hospital. Hi, I need to see a doctor. - Do you have a CPR number? - A what? - Okay, you need to fill out this form and take a number. - Do you have a phone charger? - No, we don't have a phone charger, but you can take a seat - Ms. Deray. I'm Dr. Anna Larson. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Anna Larson. - That's right. - Okay. So you wrote that your most recent sexual activity took place today with multiple partners. Were these partners known to you before? - No. - Do you wish to file a report with the activity, with the police? - I don't want to file a report. - Okay. Now please confirm your consent to a gynecological examination. - Yes. - Results of the examination, including DNA evidence, can be kept filed for three months if you wish. - No, just get rid of it. - Okay. - So now I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases? - No. - And how often are you sexually active? - I don't know. It depends. - Have you ever had an abortion? - Yes. - How many have you had? - Six. Yeah. - Okay. So now I'm going to conduct the gynecological examination. If you could please lie down. Thank you. - Hello? - Hi, is this Mads? - Yeah. - I saw your advert. So you like to suck some cock? - What? Who is this? - I'm just responding to your advert. - Fuck off. - Pricktease. "Come home for dinner." - Hi. - Hi. What a nice surprise. - Would you like some wine? - Very much. Hi. - Hi. - So to what do I owe this pleasure? - I lost the client. - Oh well, we can talk about it. I'll just take a quick shower. - Yeah. - I'll take the wine. I'll be quick. - Mmm. So nice, sweetie. - Erm. So I have something to tell you. - What is it? - I slept with a woman in London. - So what now? - Nothing. I just wanted to tell you. - Why? - Because she called the client in London and told them I raped her. No, I better get it. Hello. - Who was it? - Nobody was there. - So that's what happened with your job? - And now I'm getting calls from wankers the whole time. - Why? - I think she made an advert on the internet with my number. - Joan, was Copenhagen okay? - It was fucking shit. - Joan. Joan. "Rasha Haddad invited you to her event: "Finissage: My Life in t..." - Do you have a cigarette?
