bodies have been found just outside of lincoln police have yet to release the names of the dead but most are believed to be members of the same family witnesses are said to have heard several gunshots coming from the house in the area believed to be owned by mr mark jensen we go over now to lincoln police to speak to officer chad wilson officer wilson hi peter yes i'm afraid that the final number of deaths has now been confirmed at 14 and i can also confirm that the body of mr mark jensen was one of them mr jensen was and remains our chief suspect in this investigation due to his having shot himself at the roadside however what led mr jensen to kill his entire family still remains a complete mystery he was a well-known and respected member of this neighborhood if all is as it seems we've closed off the surrounding areas to present visitors and respectfully ask all members of the public to stay away whilst we continue to invest thank you officer wilson apparently we've got a recording of a neighbor of mr jensen's let's see what he had to say i heard all these gunshots so that's why i came outside to see what was going on and that's when i saw the blood i'm sorry i i can't say anymore so what makes a man turn a gun on his entire family i have with me today father hudson west and retired police detective dustin stafford gentlemen hi peter how would you evaluate this situation uh well situations like this are a difficult of the best of times uh coming into it from um you know fairly cold like yourself i've just seen what's been going on in the news and things like that um without knowing any kind of background information on uh mr jensen i believe his name was it's very very difficult to actually appreciate what's going through his head at the time um you know i don't i personally have no uh working knowledge of him so i you know it's very difficult to assess as to whether there was any kind of mental instability there whether it's being drug led whether you know excuse me you guys you you always go down that it's it's drugs and it's it's it's bad family homes well i wasn't saying that but you do you that you you people just don't understand that there are other things happening that there's there's other forces and and something like this you know somebody just wiping out an entire family and you know this gotta be more than just a guy flipping on drugs this is nothing to do with drugs and this is this is spiritual i'm telling you right i'm telling you that what happens here is that they get possessed it winds me up so much all right obviously i'm just looking at the information that we're getting on on the news ourselves well i'll give you information i'll give you information i'll give everybody information have you ever seen when a wall just comes to life have you ever seen mirrors have you ever seen furniture houses have you ever seen a theater full of people dispossessed have you ever seen a church have you have you ever seen a doll's house have you ever seen blood just spreading from the wall have you ever no you couldn't have seen it because you know why you couldn't have seen it because you wouldn't be sitting there just like a normal guy going it's drugs it's it's racist it's it's not sure i mean i i don't know where you're getting your information from you know we're looking at the fact that there's 12 12 dead here um you know reports i'll tell you i'll tell you i'll tell you i'll tell you where to get my information i've been there i've i've seen i've seen this i know what it looks like i've seen it with these eyes these eyes no no you you people you you just don't want to hear the truth i can't do this i'm sorry i can't do this okay and i think we should just go to a commercial break what are you okay thank you you've got 10 minutes so tell me what happened in your words you're in great danger what do you mean you have a monkey don't you how did you know about that that's the only reason why you'd be here it's evil isn't it it's more than just evil it's it's the vessel for which evil transfers between physical locations spreading all over like like a plague it all began back in amityville after he murdered his entire family everything from the estate sale went to auction houses and antique shops could be a whole 40 years before i would find it i don't understand so the ghosts of the family entered the monkey and made it evil it's the monkey itself that caused murders in the first place something demonic took over that toy very long time ago and won't let go how do you know all this it was me that brought it back home it's my fault my father killed my entire family i purchased that monkey from the amityville antique shop as a present for his 50th birthday it all started when i bought that [ __ ] monkey wow ah mom would you look at this it is this looks like just like the one i had when i was a kid where did you find this at an old antique store back home i saw it and i remembered you said you had one when you were little so i figured you'd like it like it i love it dear thank you you're welcome brown knows her wind it up all right sorry i didn't think to check to make sure if it actually worked it's all right let me take a look at it pathetic of course he doesn't want you stop this you're better than him you're better than this

don't be such a baby grandma's basically deaf my dad's probably holed up in his room and cheyenne's probably dead drunk soon so don't worry about her either come on stud this is how you raise your kids mark to [ __ ] where their grandparents can hear them and out of the holy union of marriage it's shameful really something should be done god damn this is some good food i haven't met don't you

stop me daddy that's not what i meant by saving family son this this is the solution save them from themselves just like you did carol oh daddy and not just the toy either there's been murders connected to that house every few years for the past several decades lamps and and clocks and mirrors and even a dollhouse from that evil place have all been present during several copycat killings in the 90s i think i remember reading about some of those weren't there some movies made or something hollywood loves to exploit what makes money maybe maybe i'll even sell my story for a made-for-tv movie so how do we get rid of it we must destroy the physical body forcing it to leave and move on so then that won't really stop it will it can't stop evil only ward it off evil never dies time's up you must destroy it you can't let it take over anyone else is where have you been i want to see someone you man oh hmm flies what happened what's going on let's get out of here how may i help you so but we made and they demonized he's shy oh this is oh oh is shine is shout out so so you
