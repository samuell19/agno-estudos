Nora! Nora! Fucking kid! Don't do this to me again! Don't do it again! Don't do it again! I told you twenty times! ... the most ambitious residential plan created by a private company, a fraud complaint shocks the public. We spoke to the affected parties, and we interviewed Dr. Ravenna, of the Nuevo Mundo consortium. This summer seems whimsical. A hailstorm darkened the Buenos Aires sky since 10:20 yesterday. Now, we have in direct the interview obtained by our reporters. There're news in the consortium case. What about the fraud complaint? I'm not aware of any. - Only 5 or 6 unpleased persons. - There're more than 6! People to whom you had promised residences more than 2 years ago! All companies have problems! You know of any that doesn't? I want my money back. I was told you have it. I'm unaware of that. Why the President hasn't made a statement? President Mach is out of the country. - Out of the country? - Excuse me, please. An ordinary business trip. With all his family? I'm deeply sorry. Please, gentlemen. Tomorrow at 15 hours, we'll hold a press conference. Save your questions for then. The capture of several state officials has been ordered. Anything to say? - I'm sorry. - You must answer now, Ravenna. I'll answer, but not to you, but to our partners and the 3000 that trusted us. The Nuevo Mundo consortium aims at getting fit residences for the workers. And we'll achieve that. See you tomorrow, thanks. Let's see what people on the street think. - Good speech. - Thanks. - Even I believed it. - It doesn't take much to convince you. That depends. Some guys have more persuasive powers than others. You drive. - Sex appeal. - Get in. Now you have to say: if you need me, whistle. I'll say it. And seriously. What happens tomorrow? Collapse. You'll have to find a new job. Be back in an hour. Or less. What it takes to get dressed and fix myself. Wait for me downstairs? Yeah. Betty, why don't we leave it for some other day? - It's not -- - 8 o'clock sharp. If not, I'll go upstairs for you. Tonight's my night. I want to toast with champagne, go dancing... a due celebration. Celebrate what? You're pulling my leg? Your divorce. Your wife's too distinguished to keep on living with a criminal. Who'll be waiting for you when you walk out of prison? Me. Cecilia'll be hiding her embarrassment in the southern coast. Am I right? Yes. At 8 sharp, boss. And regards to the wife. Mr. Ravenna. Easy, Ravenna. Nothing's going to happen to you. Who are you? How did you get in? What do you want? The cash, Ravenna. It's a bad day to rob me. The one in the safebox. What safebox? I don't -- Ravenna... Listen, pal, I'm broke. Really. Haven't you read the papers? Quite a robbery! Not me, my partners. You can't dry me, pal. What about the bank account? Closed. I'm going to jail. I'm serious. - Just you? - Just me? You wish. They won't fuck me just like that. When I start talking, even the Obelisco will fall. If I tell you the names involved, you won't believe them. Don't scream, Ravenna. I won't, I won't. Let me go. You've the money already. What's up? You opened the safebox? Why did you put me here? Don't... don't tell me you're a queer, pal. Now I've had it. Going to jail for fraud, I get robbed, and now you want to enter through my back door. At age fifty! Thank you. Famed businessmann Ravenna shot himself. The tragic consequence of the alleged real estate fraud. Don't worry, babe. Just a prank. What a prank. You nearly scare me to death. You're losing it, skinny. You see a babe and lose it. It's worth it. - Who's she? - A friend. Vienna. Her name is Vienna. Vienna? Like the bread? Viena, with just an N. Viena. Raul. Can you make me a coffee, babe? I'll dress first, if you don't mind. I'll wait for you outside. Be right there. Where did you get her? I picked her up in the road. She's a road girl. Works with truckdrivers. - Good service? - Yeah... - Has she been...? - Two days. Tomorrow I'll kick her out. If she starts liking the home life, I'll never get rid of her. - She's hot, right? - Yes. I thought so. I don't know why I use these if I still don't see crap. You didn't use it. It wasn't necessary. Was there any trouble? Suicide. - And these? - Greens. I know, but what for? You've paid me already. An extra. Don't complain. And the Cat? Sleeping. Where did you get the name from? Viena? It's mine. But it's your name? Your name is Mendizabal? - You ask too much. - You too. I picked it. The name of a whore who became very powerful. She piled up money until she could crush all those that had fucked her. You're dangerous. Me? Just the name. I made the wrong pick. Truckdrivers are dry. Besides, you need to be educated to climb the ladder, So you can change your environment. I'll never leave the road. Give me a cig. Wife? Kids? It's not convenient in my line of work. You two are odd. You don't look like cops. Have you ever killed someone? I ask too much. Yes. What does it feel... ... to kill someone? The same as you when you sleep with a guy. The first time is disturbing. Afterwards, you start to like it. Not always. If the Cat wakes up, he won't like it If he wakes up, he won't know where he is. How long will you stay? Tomorrow. - Work? - Maybe. Give her a ride? Yeah. Babe, you'll leave tomorrow with Raul. You can use the trip. I can go alone. Walking? Don't fuck with me. He'll take you. No problem. I'm used to walking. I'm going to bed. You'd better. Won't you play domino? It's all you need to be two retired old men. You've more than enough age! She's a little wild but a good girl. Stop it. Any minute now you'll say "this house needs a woman." Never. Was she kind? Nice nap, huh? Full service. No myopic has a single pair of glasses, skinny. Here's fine. Where do you live? I'll take you. You ask too much. You have a place to go? Viena! I wasn't working. It was a friendly gesture. This is my friendly gesture. Return it to me when you can. - Bye, Viena. - Bye. Mendizabal? Tell Dominici I'm here. Dominici's in a meeting. I can't disturb him. You'll have to settle and talk to me. And you are? - Pe?a. - Pe?a? Pe?a, you and I have nothing to talk. - Wait, Mendizabal. - Tell him to call when he can. Wait here. It's said that people mellows with age. - I want but I can't. - Me too. How much time you have? Plenty. Can I count on you? It depends. It's a delicate job. It needs to be done discreetly. Someone popular? An unknown. His name is Kulpe. Rodolfo Kulpe. He knows things, and he's looking for someone to talk to. We want to know where he goes. Who he talks to, his contacts. For how long? I'll let you know. Pe?a will be your liaison. Let him know everything. I want another envelope like this when I'm done. For playing detective. On one condition: Kulpe must suffer a nervous depression. A mental breakdown. Every day. Address' in the back. That's all you know? Name and address? All that concerns you. You don't like your job, Pe?a? I don't like dealing with people like you. You prefer green-eyed blond guys? If I find one, I'll send him to you. 31 Mint. And give me a cube. Magic. - How much? - Ten bucks. MONDAY. Leaves: 9:00 Returns: It's wide but lacks light, madam. Inner rooms are like that. The ones facing the street are better. Come. - Is it noisy? I'm a lightsleeper. - I've a pill for that. A car once in a while but... This is not the country, sir. Don't you have anything more isolated? What you're looking for? An apartment? - I don't like hotel rooms. - Who does? I don't like it all, but in life, you don't do what you like. - Certainly. - Yes, certainly. What a pity. I've a room upstairs. - It might work. - It might, but it's occupied. - Bad luck. - Bad luck. Wait! How long were you planning to stay? I don't know... A month... fifteen days... A month! Well, I warn you that payment is per week. And in advance. Some people... - I can pay you a month, madam. - Really? Two months. I travel. I never know when I'm here or when I'm there. You travel. Come with me. Come. I'll show you. Do you sell anything worthwhile? Photographic articles. - Really? - Photocopiers. - Good business? - So-so. If it were good, I wouldn't stay the whole summer in Buenos Aires. You've a point. You wouldn't sell those... dirty... pornographic pictures, right? You've quite a witty face. Be gone, shorty. You're moving downstairs. - But Beba... - Downstairs. Downstairs! I don't have air conditioner. I can give you a ventilator. - It's fine. - It's fine. Just a friend. Don't worry. He's leaving already. Is the bed fine or you'd prefer a... double bed? - It's perfect. - Perfect? Okay. - May I open? - Sure. Make yourself at home. Do you smoke? Then please use the ashtrays. That's what they're for. Nothing bothers me more than having the furniture burnt. Other than that, make yourself at home. This way from the door, it's your life. But no women. That's what I'm here for. Just joking. It was a joke. Married? Divorced? Single? Good choice. Women always bring trouble. Well... Have you made up your mind or you'll be staring there all day? No, it's perfect. - Perfect? Then you'll rent it? - Yes, yes. Great. Don't worry about hot water. We have an electric termostate. What else? The telephone... Cat? Yeah? I need your help. You have to kill both? Only the guy. His name's Kulpe. - What did he do? - I don't know. If they want him dead, he did something. Somebody judged him and found him guilty. That's what you have to find out. Who he is, what he does. Cop, detective... - There's something I don't like. - And the girl? Exactly what doesn't work, doesn't fit... doesn't make sense. Cecilia Ravenna. Rings a bell. Ravenna's wife? The same Ravenna? What does she have to do with this? If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you. It'll be expensive. I'll have to feed a lot of people. Take what you need, and the money for the Magnum too. Keep the rest. This is a lot of cash. And there's more. I asked double and didn't even wince. Too much money, Raul. Do you know what the matter is? I'm tired of having to deal with things by myself. Dealing with things myself, speaking to the trees... What can happen? If it doesn't work, I'll kick her out. She's a street girl, Cat. And I'm an architect? She'll rob you. They all rob you. It's simple: instead of paying her, I'll give her money and food. Isn't it the same? It's your business. I warned you. I'm not saying I want to marry her, or reform her. She's a good girl, she's nowhere to go, and I let her live here. What's wrong? Years don't come alone. Do you want my glasses? What was that of the years...? Son of a bitch. Do you know what day is today? Thursday. I can tell you the time as well. Leave your phone and address. Why did you move? That's you brought me here for? You had orders to keep me informed on Sunday! Sunday! Three days ago! I work my way. - Nobody gives me orders. - And Dominici? Dominici suggests. When he wants something, he sends for me. He never says anything. Don't leave. What did you learn? Nothing. Just questions. Who's Kulpe? What does he have to do with Ravenna? What Ravenna? The consortium guy? Nothing at all. Why? Nothing concrete. You suicided him? Why do you want Kulpe killed? Orders. Dominici has a strict security policy. He doesn't let his right hand know what his left one does. It's his rule of thumb. Thus far, it's worked for him. But you disagree. - Partly. - He has another rule. He doesn't waste my time. Very professional. Too professional. - Dangerous. - Only for Mr. Kulpe. For now. Tomorrow can be me or Dominici. You're not with us. You're with anyone. I'm a weapon, Pe?a. He who can, buys it and uses it. - People like you... - You told me already. But unfortunately we're useful. One day you won't. It's difficult. It's always been the same. You have to kill in order to get what you want, and then you have to kill to keep it. Who taught you that? Dominici? Everybody says the same: the one that stands against us must be erased. I'm not with anyone, Pe?a. I work for myself. And luckily, both you and your foes agree on one thing: if there's a dirty job, let's call Mendizabal. But sleep soundly, Pe?a. I never take more than a job at the same time. Are you OK? May I help you? I'm OK, thank you. Doesn't seem so. I'm just dizzy. Low pressure. - But allow me... - I'm fine! I'm fine! - It won't go up. - What happened? - It broke. - Well, hurry if you want to play. You made it yourself? What for? I can buy it already made. So that this doesn't happen. They're too heavy. They use wood instead of cane. You know how to make one? I don't remember much. Bruno, the gentleman doesn't have time to waste. I've plenty of time, madam. Keep the wire. It's good. - Do you know the box kites? - No. The best of them all. They fly really high. And they never entangle. Will you make me one? - Maybe. - If not, I'll buy another. Goodbye, madam. I'm sorry for disturbing you. Have you repented about the box kite already? Won't it bring you problems to receive one from a stranger? No problems. There's no husband. But don't worry. Never mind. I'll buy him another. I can... Will you have everything by tomorrow? Yes. We'll be around here by 4. 4 o'clock. I don't know your name. Mendizabal. Raul Mendizabal. Laura Kulpe... Ramos. Ex-Kulpe. Laura. Mr. Mendizabal! Good afternoon, you're expected. He said he was a friend of yours... very charming. I told him to wait downstairs but he insisted. I couldn't stop him. I really couldn't. Congratulations, Mendizabal. I knew you had a thing for pictures, but I didn't know it was like these. How did you get it, Pe?a? Money makes the world turn. And hotel owners too. Nice female, huh? Leave, Pe?a! Tell me what you're here for and leave! All this to shoot a guy? Won't you be going nuts? I don't like working for free, Pe?a. But with you, I can make an exception. What do you want? Dominici sent you? There's a change of orders. Put that down, don't fuck. Time's up, Mendizabal. Kulpe must be killed immediately. Dominici asked for discretion. And asked for information. It doesn't matter now. There's no time. Finish your job and disappear. Quickly. - I want to see Dominici. - Dominici's out of sight. You'll have to listen to me from now on. Phone him if you want. He'll tell you the same. That I'm in charge. What happened? We'll play by the book for a while. Some people started asking around... Dominici made a mistake. He thought he'd never be accountable for anything. You helped him be mistaken? Perhaps. Do we agree then? Yes. But there's a problem. Ravenna's wife. What do I do with her? We want Kulpe. No one else. When he returns alone... When Kulpe returns alone to his apartment... That too? It's brand new. It's filthy! - Hello. - Hi. You could've let me know your friend's a filthy mess. That's why they call him the Cat. Since I know him, he's bathed four times. Five. Don't say a word, not a word. It's all my fault. It's not bad for you. Nice smell. Are you staying? No. I'm fleeing soon. Have you learnt anything? Yes. Your friend Kulpe doesn't exist. Not a cop, not a detective, not a thief. No records of him. And the girl? Why's she with him? Ravenna's girl? Chance. Cupid. She met him and liked him. That girl's in anything that goes. Why so many questions? You have to find him and shoot him, Raul. Unemployment's coming. Listen to me. Finish this quickly and go on vacation. Bad environment. Know him? Oh, yeah. Since he was a small crook. Then he thrived. He's Ferrari. Don't mess with Ferrari. Let him be. Why? He's a top player. Top, top, top. I'll leave it to you since he's a friend of yours. Make him talk to see what he knows of Kulpe. You're ready? I'm shriveled. And the head? Wash your head. I'll take my glasses off. I don't want to see his face. Staying for a meal? I can't. Another day. Cat... I'm needing some cane. What? - Cane. - ?Cane? Cane. ?Cane? - Cane - ?Cane? - ?Cane? ?As in the rods? - Yes. I've some old ones. Will they do? Perfect. - Where are they? - The warehouse. Hey, what are they for? For a kite. A what? I've to make a kite. - What did he say? - A kite. Shut up and close your eyes. It leaked, it leaked. It burns. I thought you wouldn't be here. I'm here. And your son? I left him at home, just in case. He knows how to lose, but I don't want him to get used to it. He was very hopeful about the kite. If you didn't show up, I'd buy him one and say it was a gift from you. Finding one wouldn't be easy. No. - I'll go for him. - I'll wait for you here. Won't you come? It's just three blocks. It's easier with glue. Paste's the best. Hot water cooks the flour and when it dries, not even rain can unpaste it. You don't fly a kite when it rains. Help me. So you see how it'll look like. - Beautiful. - That's it. Can we try it? Tomorrow. We have to wait till it dries in order to finish it. It's easier to buy it done. You get along well with children. I talk to them as to the grownups. It's not odd that you're single. But it's odd that you've never wanted to have children. What I know is not to be shared with anyone. How exaggerated. Some things are worth it. Mum! Making a box kite, for instance. Was it that terrible? No, but you don't make them every day. - It looks well? - Yes. - Let's see. - Very good. - How cute. Now take us one. But let the kite in the picture too. Too low? Yes, yes. That's it. There... Smile! - Is he asleep? - Dead asleep. That side. After a year, I quitted. I never saw my boy. Now, I work part time at school in the morning. In the afternoon, I typewrite, translate... anything. I can't stop. If I do, I run out of budget. - And your husband? - Ex husband. Kulpe. He doesn't provide? Sometimes. After getting me to plead, or when he wants to see me. Let's not speak of Rodolfo. It makes me... feel bad. I put up with it for Bruno. Unfortunately, he's the father. Though he sees so little of him that it makes no difference. He's bad seed. I'm impulsive. I made a mistake and I admit it. Never wanted to kill someone? I did. Being impulsive's not my only defect. I talk too much, I say what I feel and I'm quite reckless. I can spend the afternoon in my apartment with someone I met on a square, someone that hardly speaks, that only confesses to travel a lot, being a bachelor, and a kite expert. There's not much else to know. I must leave, Laura. Thanks for everything. On the contrary. Bruno had a nice time. I'm not supposed to be the one to say it but... I'd like to see you some other time. I go nearly every afternoon to the square. We agree. "We agree". What do you mean? Tomorrow? I can't fly that huge thing. - Tomorrow - At 4. - At 4. Mr. Mendizabal. Thank you for being from another time. Yes? Look, mister... Good morning, mister. No complaints to you, but tell your friends to call at reasonable hours. Who phoned? 3 o'clock in the morning! How's that? They woke me up and wanted me to wake you up! Who was it? I don't know. I don't remember. A Mr. Antunez... Domunez.. - Funes? - Yes... or something like that. What did he say? What did he want? Speak to you. I told you that. I told him it was late, that I wouldn't wake you up. He got mad, he yelled at me and I hung up. - Who did it? - I don't know. I returned a while ago and found him. Grab your stuff and let's leave. You can't stay. I've it already. It's my fault for leaving him alone. They'd have killed you too. You've no fault. I asked him to get some information for me. Do you know where he went? Did he mention something? To a bar. We fought over that. A strip tease bar. I got mad and left. Why going for a whore when he has a whore at home? Senseless! Where can I take you? I can't bring you with me. I've things to do and I must be alone. Here's fine. Babe. Here. You'll need it. I still owe you the other money. I know, I remember. Bye... Viena. Bye. Come for me one of these days. Beer. Let's go inside. I need to talk to you. Put that away. You don't need it. Come. Your beer. What's the matter? What do you want to talk about? A friend of yours: Kulpe. I want to know who he is. Why? He's a friend. I want to know what he's into. I don't know. Why should I? It's OK. I was going to kill you anyway. Who are you, pal? What did I do to you? Are you on drugs? Funes the Cat was with you last night. He's another friend. He comes when he wants to. He won't come anymore. You had him killed. He left away with Lupe. Rodolfo. It's me. Open up. If you scream, I'll kill you. If you don't, you'll be fine. Is it clear? Huh? Is it clear? I'd better be quiet. Tell me where Kulpe is. Upstairs, waiting for me. Where is he? Upstairs, waiting... What's the matter? Huh? What's it it with Kulpe? Huh? You want to scream more than me? Oh, no. Fucking slut! Tell me where he is! I don't know. You don't? You son of a bitch! Tell me where he is! Wait, wait. You want to see how your face ends up like? Really? No, wait! What is Kulpe? A cop? A cop? No way. My ear hurts. - Don't lie to me, slut! - Wait, wait, come here! He works for you. Do you want to know what happened to your husband? My husband shot himself. My husband... Come, that's it. Come here. Tell me where is he. Wait. I'll wait for you, if you give me what I want. Fuck me, baby. Piece of shit! I'll tell you nothing! Rodolfo will kill you, son of a bitch! No! - Raul. - I must speak to you. Come in, please. Bruno's sleeping. We were waiting for you. I must leave quickly. I want to know something. When did you last see Kulpe? Thursday or Friday. Why? I must speak to him. But you don't know him... I've to see him. Don't ask! Where's he? He phoned this morning from the airport. He was leaving for Mendoza, I think. He didn't say. Probably a week, as usual. Raul... Raul, what's the matter? What's with Rodolfo? Why're you looking for him? I've a job to do. Are you insane? Why did you call me? Talk quickly. I don't want us to be seen together. - Kulpe left. - And you let him? Of all those corpses you left, none was Kulpe's. Quite a fuck up! I need time, Pe?a. One more day and I'll find him. Forget it. - Disappear, bury yourself. - I can't. I don't like leaving things unfinished. You do what I say. Your job's done, finished. Kulpe's dead. Vanished. One day! Pe?a, 24 hours! Don't you get it, Mendizabal? You're nobody. You have nothing. Not even time. Nothing. Here. Go anywhere. Out of the country. If you can. What we had arranged. Count it, if you like. The job's not finished. Think of it as your retirement funds, Mendizabal. Hold it right there, Mendizabal. Drop the gun. Turn around if you like. It's a pleasure. A real pleasure, Mendizabal. You're a very prestigious man. This work's not bad but it entails its risks. One must learn to leave in time. Today it's you, tomorrow me. They have to erase us. We know too much and we're in the business. For a good payment, we can start talking. And it's not a bad idea. The days of the braves are gone. For now. You said it very well, Mendizabal. How was it? I've a job to do. If that's the matter, I've no problem in keeping the room for him. He doesn't know how long he'll be gone. He's some monies to collect. I understand, but why didn't he let me know sooner? I don't get it. Such a correct and charming man. What a pity. I've no problem giving you his things, but why didn't he let me know sooner? Why? I could've rented the room and... Mendizabal thinks of everything. He left this for you. No need to, but thanks. It was odd that he left... where? - Mendoza. - Mendoza, yes. Will be useful. He's a very organized man. Very careful. Though he smokes too much. Have you seen how he smokes? I told him nothing bothers me more than having the furniture burnt. Just like that. I put ashtrays everywhere and for what? Look, madam. Am I right? It can burn the curtain! A beautiful cloth! Anyway, it's always the same with the tenants. It hurts, because it's my house. Though I rent it, I feel like this room is mine. Subtitles: CLAB
