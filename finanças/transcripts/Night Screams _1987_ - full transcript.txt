So are you guys like going steady or what? What's that, Russell? Um, I was just singing that old country song, you know, are you guys ready or what? I mean, you know that one, don't you? No, I don't.

Don't be a fool, all right? Just-- just don't start crying to me. Seriously, man, what's up with you? The same old football shit, man, scholarship, school, everything. It's all coming down on me at once. Dave, you're making me crazy because of this football stuff, you know that? You got what everybody else wants, and you sit here bitching about it. Damn it, DB, just because it's what everybody else wants, that doesn't mean it's what I want. I'm tired of this bullshit. I'm tired of it. I know where you're coming from. This is more crap about your father, isn't it? Yeah, it is. It is. So what now? He wants me to play for OU. I don't want to play for OU. I don't know if I want to play for OU. And that damn scout keeps following me around and pushing the signing agreements. I can't believe it. [YODA VOICE] Hmm, that is where you fail, young Skywalker. Hmm. Seriously, it'll be all right. All right. So did you sign yet? No, but I'm going to have to. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. You try dealing with my father. Excuses, man. Dave, you got to tell your father how you feel, and you've got to tell him now. Tell him you want to start making your own decisions in life. Tell him you want to stop living for him and start living for yourself. But tell him now. Now! I can't damn it! While you got the chance, now, before it's too late. I never had that chance with my mom. Yeah. That's wrong. That's wrong. I had the chance. I just didn't take it. But you man, your dad is still around. You can take it. So make it right, you know? Yeah, I understand what you're trying to say. It's just not the same, DB. You're the best, buddy. That's what she said. Ladies and gentlemen, the nationally famous Sweetheart Dancers.

You know what I've got tonight? Champagne. Oh, you do, huh? I want some champagne. Cut it out, Doug. Cut it out, Doug. I can't cut it out until I want to get in her pants. You're a horny bitch, and everybody knows it. See, Doug, all you ever do is think about sex, you know, it's disgusting. Why don't you think about something a little bit more rewarding. Like money. Hey, just because you're this big, there's no reason to give me shit. Hey, gang, has anybody seen Joni? Not for a while. Come on, let's you and me go, Doug. All right. Hey, uh, Chuck, you lose something, buddy? That Dave's a real pain in the ass sometimes. Talking about friends. She's hanging all over him like he's some kind of stud. Yeah, well, at least my girl isn't a stuck up bitch like Brenda. You got your bitch hanging, buddy. Go to hell, Mason. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] I believe I have seen the end. It came to me like a long-lost friend. What's with the dip? Who knows. [SINGING] Hey lady lonely and happy. I see you standing over there. So do you think David likes Joni? No. No? I know he likes her. He told me. I think Joni likes David. She's so shy. It's hard to talk to her. Yeah. Maybe there's just too many people around him. Yeah, it could be. You know, maybe just the four of us should go out, you know, without the pack. That sounds great. I'd really like to see it work out between them. Yeah. David's going through a lot right now. He could use somebody like her. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] good for her too. Yeah. He [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. I think it would be good for us to go out without the pack. Yes? Really? You would go out with me? Yeah. Yeah? Jerk. [DOG BARK] [MUSIC PLAYING] Fall in, Jarob, to be weak.

Well I could be having a lot more. Come on, get serious. I am, David. Well, things are different now, OK? I'm with Joni. You didn't used to mind my hands on your body. I said they're different. Touchy, touchy. What's the matter? Forget to take your medicine? I'm going back to the party, OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] Russell, baby! God, Lisa! God! Hey, I thought the dog barked [INAUDIBLE]..

Come on, Chris. I seen cars pass [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, come on, it was 27 to 46 last game. He had 390 yards. Big deal. The guy's incompetent. Oh, well, coming from someone who said KC would win the Super Bowl, I really value your opinion. Don't get her going, Mason. She'll tear your apart. Yeah, if it was me calling the shots, it would have been a different story. Oh, if they had you calling the shots, they never would have gotten out of pre-season. I'd be on the front of every Wheaties box from here to California. CHRIS: You'd be on the front of every can of jock itch. I told you, Mason, she tore you apart. MASON: Whatever. Yeah, give me another beer, Doug. Anybody see where Brenda went? Hi, Brenda. David, I thought you were up here. You haven't said one word to me all night. I haven't even gotten to congratulate you on your scholarship. Why don't you congratulate Mason on his. State College, big deal. I want to congratulate a real man. Brenda, don't ever do that again, OK? David, it never bothered you before. [MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN [ON TV]: Ellis, the doctor's here. MAN [ON TV]: Um, I'm not really a doctor. I'm the, uh, um, the medic for the ski lift. [MUSIC PLAYING] MASON: Hey, Dave, have you seen Brenda? What's going on here? - Nothing. Hey, asshole, I said, what's going on here? Get your hands off of me. [MUSIC PLAYING] So you're kissing his ass like everybody else is? Mason, I was just talking to him. Yeah, well, follow me in the bedroom. I'll show you a real stud. Go on in, I'll be there in a minute. You sure? Of course I'm sure. I'll be waiting. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARK] [GROAN] MAN [ON TV]: Sorry, um, how about the knee? WOMAN [ON TV]: Ahh! MAN [ON TV]: Um, you don't mind if I-- this jacket is-- is a little warm. WOMAN [ON TV]: No, sure. Take it off. Thank you. It's probably the fireplace. Um, where else did it hurt? Right up in here.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Honey, I'm really-- Will you just quit talking about it? Thank you. Next time I want one of them little cherries. I'm going to call David. Damn it, he's fine. He's a big boy now. You got to quit following him around babying him. You plan on following him out in a football field too? [RING TONE] Please answer. Sounds like you both had fun being cheerleaders with the pom poms and everything. I don't use pom poms. She does. I'm head cheerleader. That's right, Joni, she's head cheerleader. So where do you live before you moved to Wichita? In a really nice place. I'm going to go downstairs. I'll see you later. Bye, Joni. A really nice place? God, what a dickhead. Shut up, Chris. God knows how hard it is to make friends at our school. How did she ever get David? Mason. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mason, you peckerwood. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARK] If I had my way, we'd just go over there and turn that whole place into a parking lot. Right, free enterprise backing itself up all the way, huh, Chuck? Absolutely. Smile. Hey, how much do you want for the [INAUDIBLE] brand? BRENDA: I don't suppose any of you have seen Mason. I saw him call Joni upstairs about five minutes ago. You liar. RUSSELL: Why would I lie? Uggh.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, where are the lemons? Lemons? We don't need no stinking lemons. [LAUGHTER] This is good stuff, man. Hey, hey, Joni. You don't look like you're having too much fun. RUSSELL: Yeah, about as much fun as shock therapy. I was just kidding. Joni, come on, Lisa. Do you even know her? What do you mean, know her? I just met her.

She's cute, and she's shy, and I like her. No, I mean, she's really sensitive. I mean, you should've seen the way she took off after one of Russell's jokes. - Oh, what the hell. Anybody would [INAUDIBLE]. No, this was different. Look, DB, I like her, OK? So don't lay any bogus trips on her, OK? Yeah. All right. Hey, I'm just looking after my buddy. That's all, OK? - All right. I'm going to go get a beer. Go get a beer. [WHISTLE] David, you all right? Joni, oh, yeah, I'm just a little dizzy. The richest creature.

Hey, you know, you're very, very beautiful, you know that? Are you pleased, Runner? Are you? Careful of mirrors, Runner. They're the playthings of men's vanities. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where's Davey boy?

Oh, don't be too hard on Russell. You just have to learn how to take him. He's really a good guy. I suppose the same goes for Brenda and Chris? No, Brenda has no brains. And Chris, she's insensitive, insecure, oversexed. Once you realized that, it's easy to ignore them. I'll try to remember that. Why did you come tonight? You're so different from them. Well, it's a party. Well, DB's here, well, and you, I knew it wouldn't be a total loss. Thanks. RUSSELL: Hey, Lisa, you want to play pool, games? Go ahead.

I just don't think this party is a very good idea. Joni, it's my party. It's my rules, all right? I invite who I want, and everybody knows that. Everyone knows how special you are to me. It's all that counts. You worry too much. Just be yourself. You'll have a good time, I promise you. David is this yours? What is it? You were only nine when you won this. Yeah, I know. I didn't even know they had football teams for nine-year-olds. Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, they didn't. My dad thought it would be a good idea, gave him a little early start. They put the money up, got a Little League started. Did you want to play at nine? Sure, dad wanted me to. - But did you? - I don't know. Why not? I was good. It was fine. Still is. You are good at it, and I'm proud of you. I'm proud you won the scholarship. Thanks. So was dad. Just what he wanted. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Hey, mister lonely and unhappy.
