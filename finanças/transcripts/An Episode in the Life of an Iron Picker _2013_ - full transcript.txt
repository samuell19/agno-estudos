Good God. Sandra, be nice. Are you my little baby? Are you? Papa, I want to watch my series. We have no firewood. Senada... come take this wood. Hey brother! Want to help me? Okay. Come on. How's it going? Fine. Nazif, right? Yes. That's it, Ibrahim. Okay. Nine hundred, forty times zero point twenty. One hundred, fifty-three marks. The wife is going to kill me when I get home. No, she won't. Where have you been, what have you been doing. Tell her we were picking iron, making money. Huh, as if that's big money. It's good enough. Here you go. Let's just down these. To your health brother. What will your wife say? What can she say? What's there to say? Where were you, Refke? There was a long line. We were waiting. And when she smells the alcohol on you? I have some gum. Gum? Thanks, see you. See you. How are you, missus? Fine, making dinner. Making dinner, eh. Give us a kiss. Here's what I got for today’s work. Is that all? That's it for today. God willing, you'll get more tomorrow. God willing. Hey Sandra, Šemsa. I'm going to eat now. Papa, I want some ketchup. Did you drink my juice? No. Who did? Yum, yum, yum, yum. So? What? What are you looking at? Go on. Come on. Oh God. So are you going? Just go. Nazif, papa give me a marker. Bye, baby girl. Mama, give me a marker. I don't have one. But you do, you have many. I do not. You do, you do. I have to lift the couch to find you one. Come on, be reasonable. Calm down, child. What's that? Sandra. What's that? Cheese. Go and wait for me there. No. Go, mama's darling. No, I'm waiting here. Go on. What's wrong, Senada? Senada? Huh? What is it? I feel pain in my stomach. Oh dear God. What's hurting? My belly. Is it bad? Well, it hurts. Oh dear mother of God. Papa, who took the batteries? Oh dear, woman, what's wrong with you? My stomach hurts. Let's go to the doctor. No, not until tomorrow. Hey, Sandra. Did you do any hard work? Did you lift something heavy? No. I was just doing laundry. Laundry... Is there something to eat? Yes. Where are you off to so early? I'm taking Senada to the hospital. Her stomach hurts, and she's bleeding. Let me help you with that. Let me get that. Just put them in the back. Thanks. Something is wrong with the baby. What happened? She says it's dead. She'll give us a referral. Something's wrong. Senada, this is a miscarriage. Since you've been bleeding forgive days, it's urgent that you get to the clinic. They'll do a full curettage and all your problems will go away. So, straight to the clinic now. Don't go home. Are we clear? Here's the referral slip. Thank you. Can I help you? Good afternoon. Here's the referral. You'll have to wait. We have another patient. We don't have an insurance card. Just wait a bit. Senada, come on in. I'm sorry, this is an emergency. Nazif? Since your wife has no insurance. You'll have to pay 980 marks. Yes? For the procedure. We've stopped the bleeding for the moment. Here's the slip for the payment. But where will I get that kind of money? Sir, please. If you want your wife to have the surgery, you have to pay. We don't have that kind of money. Please, can we pay it in installments? Can't you call someone, please? I'm begging you, save her. Okay, I'll try. Papa, I can't. Sir, the director of the hospital says it is not possible. Dear Lord, where will I get 980 marks? I don't know. Can't you see our situation, try something. I understand, but... Come on. Please! Please! I did all I could. I called the director. I tried to help you, but... Please, have pity on those two kids. What will happen to my wife? I don't know. We are not from around here. Do you have any idea how far it is to our village from here? What can I do? I've called, pleaded, but there's nothing to be done. Let's go home. Let's go home. Sandra, Šemsa. Papa, this thing is not working. You're back. What happened with Senada? She's sick, she's lying down. We went to the hospital. The baby is dead. They want 980 marks. The baby's dead? She needs surgery. What are you going to do? I don't know. I really don't know. I have no idea. Dear Lord, why do you always make the poor suffer...? Nazif? Yes. I'm in pain. A lot? Yes. What is it Alimanović? Did you pay? No doctor, where would we get 980 marks? I can't help you. The director said, 'no payment, no surgery'. She's bleeding. What should I do, sir? I'd like to help you but orders are orders. Please. Please, I'm begging you to help us. I'm sorry, I'd help you out if it was up to me. What happened? They turned her away again? Yes. The girls are sleeping. They watched TV and fell asleep. See you brother. Okay, see you. I need to rest, too. Thank you for looking after the kids. Kasim! Kasim! Bro! What? Come out and give me a push. My car won’t start... Okay, go. Forward now. Let's try backwards again. Oh God, this car. Careful. Okay, go. It's not working. Just park it. Okay, you're right, let's park it. Go. Hello, good afternoon. Is this social services? It's Indira, chairman of the Roma Women Association "Better Future". I have here Nazif Mujić from the village of Poljice. His wife has some health problems. Senada Alimanović. I know that you know about it. They have a problem. They have no money, and they have to pay almost 1,000 marks. She has no insurance card. Is there anything that can be done? I mean, it's an emergency. She's pregnant... it's only logical that she'd be covered... So, there's nothing you can do to help? Well, who can? God save us. Goodbye. They can't do anything about it. They have no grounds on which to insure her. I don't know what to... I've contacted the hospital. It's urgent. She could get sepsis any minute now. Go ask Ziba if she's heard from the hospital. Don't worry, Nazif, we'll act on it right away. Please do. They have to take her even without payment. I got through to the hospital. If she's not insured, she has to pay. Even in an emergency? A miscarriage? That's what they said. I don't know if it's valid information. We should check it out. Please call the Ministry of Health right away and ask them who will pay Senada's bill. I'll call both the Cantonal and the Federal ministries. Call them all. I swear, Amir, it was better during the war. You were in the war? In the trenches? You bet, four years. Even lost a brother on the front line. Three men from the village were killed. With your brother? Yes. It was a tragedy. I remember it well. A plastic bag... and I'm thinking to myself, no way a grown man could fit in there. My dear Lord. My other brother said, let's open it up. We opened it up, and only the head was intact. Everything else was in pieces. Arms, legs, everything. Just the head was left. He was in pieces... thousands of pieces. And today I can't tell anyone that I was in the Army, or that I've lost a brother. You have no benefits? I have nothing. No pension, nothing. No welfare, no children allowance, nothing. I live off scrap metal, what I can collect... I don't know what to do. Senada, I've brought the lady from "Land of Children". She'll take you to the hospital. Good afternoon. How are you Senada? Did you pack everything you'll need? I didn't pack anything. Why not, Senada? Didn't Nazif tell you we're coming. I don't want to go. There's no point. Senada, you're coming with us. It will be fine. It won't be fine. I went twice already, but they told me... Senada, come with us please. No, there's no point. It's different this time, Senada. You went with Nazif before, but now you'll go with us. No, thank you. Oh God, Senada, you have to. No, thank you. I'll never go back there again. Good luck. OK Nazif. We'll be in touch. That's a good idea. I'll try to get there with Senada if the sister-in-law will give us her insurance card. She'll do it? I'll be over in the morning. I'll borrow a car. Her life is in question. So you're sure she'll give it to us? Okay, say hello to father-in-law. Sure, I'll give the children a kiss. Senada, I just talked to your mother. She'll give us an insurance card to go to Doboj, to the hospital. I'm not going anywhere. Why not? What if it's the same as here? They'll take you in, we'll have an insurance card. I won't go. Come on, don't fuck with me. What will happened to these kids if something happens to you? You have to go. I don't know what will happen there. Don't throw your life away, woman. Refik, can I borrow your van? You can, but the heat doesn't work and there's no gas in it. I need to take Senada to the hospital. If you want it, you can have it. No, I'll ask Suljo. OK, I would help if I could. Hey. Hey. Can you lend me your car to take Senada to the hospital? It's an emergency. Help me out, please. Of course. So it's serious? Her life is at stake. Thank you, bro. Good luck. How are you doing mother-in-law? I'm well, how are you? I've come for the insurance card. I'll help you, but I have to ask the daughter-in-law if she can risk it. I'll give you the card, but it's your own responsibility. Here. Has it been validated? Yes, it's been validated. You will have no problems with it. Come, see Senada. Here. How are you? I'm well, how are you? Are you feeling any better? To the hospital again. Thank you sister-in-law. Go now and take care. Be mindful. Good afternoon. Can I help you? She's in pain and bleeding a few days now. Do you have a referral? No. Give me your insurance card. Munevera, I need your ID. I left it home, we were in a rush. OK, please wait there. I don't want to sit. Look there. Mujić Munevera. I'm here. Come with me, Munevera. Wait, let's see what happens to mama. Where is mama? Sit down now. Shush. Nazif. Leave me, I can do it. Oh, just look at her. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Are you Munevera's husband? Yes. Why did you wait so long, my dear man? We had no means of transport. We operated. There were no complications. But if you had waited any longer, things wouldn't be so good. Thank you, doctor. God bless you. She's in post-op. We'll look after her for a while and then release her. Good. She'll have to take some medicine. I will buy them. They're not cheap though. Sixty marks just one of them. No problem, doctor. She really has to take them. Thank you. God bless you. Should I treat you or something? No need, good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Everything is here sir. Don't forget about the medicine. I won't. Should I treat you? No need. Thank you and God bless you. I feel weak. Take it easy. You've made it. What's with the power? Turn on the TV. There's no power, what can I do? I want to do it. OK, you do it. Good. Kasim!? Kasim!? What? Why is the power out? The power company came and cut it. We had no money to pay. Why didn't you call me? I told them you went to the hospital with your wife. They said it was no concern to them, they had orders to cut it off. Come and help me get the battery from the car so at least we have some light for tonight. OK, how's Senada? Let it go. There we go. It's working You just need to tighten it a bit. That will do. How are you sister-in-law? You made it. Barely, thank God. Papa, I'm cold. You're cold too? Papa will cover you. I'm cold too. You too? Papa will get a blanket to cover you. Mama, get up. Mama, get up on you feet. Kasim! Kasim! What? Let's cut my car, come on. Come on, I have to pay the power bill and get Senada's medicine. Refke! Refke! Do we need tools? Help me cut it up, please. Yes. Come on, I need the money. Sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety-four marks. Thanks, see you. Thank you and God bless you, Nazif. Go and pay it. OK. Wait here while I get the medicine. Thank you, bless you. Male coffee. With balls. Nazif! Yeah? The electricians are here to turn the power back on. Bravo, here comes the power. Praise be to them. Thank God you came Well done guys. Well done guys. Fine, how are you? Is it on? We barely got through to the village. Here comes the power, Šemsa. Are you glad? Thank you. Bless you. Thanks. God bless you guys. Well, see you. Let's see if it's all OK. The power is back. It's back, eh? Where is my series now? Oh, your hands are cold. Where is my DVD? Just put it back in as it was. Papa? It's not there Šemsa, you'll break it. I know, Papa. See you spilled the water now. Senada, I'll go chop some wood for the fire. Go...
