--== McEphie ==-- Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. -[phone ringing] - Hello, dear? Hey, Simone. Let's switch places. Mom, I need an extra 500 pesos. - [gunshots] - [people shouting] Mom! Mom! What's happening? [disembodied voices] Mom, hey! Wake up! What― What's the matter? Nothing. Good morning. I swear to God if I get a heart attack! Then I'll bring you to the hospital. Whatever! If you don't get up now, you're going to be late. - Whatever! - Ouch! Hey! I'm sorry. Hey, Mom. - Cut it out! - I was just kidding! - Get out of my way. - Fine, I will. Wow. My mom looks so pretty. I know I don't, you liar. Help me with this. Make sure it's in the middle. - There. - Do it properly. Of course. Done! Is that good? See? You look pretty. Anyway, where's my allowance? I knew it was just lip service. - Here. - Hey. Why are your hands cold? Are you nervous? I am. Well, then maybe you shouldn't go. Seriously? Then how am I going to pay for your tuition? Fine, just hurry up. I made breakfast. - Okay. - Hurry up. Do you like it? It's okay. It's not that burnt. Gee, thanks! I put so much effort into that. Twenty! Hand it over! What for? Really? You promised to pay me twenty every time I catch you doing that. - So... - Damn it. Come on, hand it over. - Here. - That's what I'm saying! - What if they turn me down? - [video game sounds] Then it's their loss. It's that simple. - Stop playing. - Give me a sec. I'm talking to my friends about our class report― You're just playing! Put that away! No, wait. It's a ranked match! Put it down. Fine. I'm all ears. I'm worried they'll turn me down. Don't worry, Mom. I got your back. - Silly. - Hey, that hurts. You messed up my hair. Listen, Mom. You have no reason to be nervous. You can do it. I believe in you. Well, then. I have to go. Bye! Take care. - [passengers talking] - [cars honking] Miss Aragon, come in. If this is about your request, I'm sorry but I can't do anything about it. What you did was a dereliction of duty. You failed at keeping those people safe. You neglected your duties. Sir, I really need this job. Just give me another chance. My son's graduating soon. He can't stop school now. I hear you. But you have to understand that we lost one of our biggest accounts because of that incident. I had to pull some strings so the media won't catch on. I tried looking for a different job, but the salary just doesn't cut it. [lock clicking] Simone, no one can know about what I'm about to tell you. Okay, sir. Obviously, I can't assign you to a bank or any high-risk area. One of my guards went AWOL. Her name's Ciel. She was five months pregnant. She just vanished. Probably ran off with her boyfriend. She was a night shift guard at an abandoned building in Manila. I can handle that, sir. The owner said it's a condemned building, but he doesn't have the means to have it demolished. He can't have it turn into a hub of drug addicts and informal settlers so he had us look after it. What do I have to do? You just have to complete two rounds every night. At midnight and at 3 in the morning. Especially at 3 in the morning. Renante will be there at 6 in the morning to relieve you. - That's it. - [distant clock ticking] All right. Don't show up here anymore. I'll take care of your pay. Remember... I handpicked you for this. Thank you, sir. Hey, come here. We need to talk. I need to work on my homework. This won't take long. I have something to tell you before I leave for work. Sit down. You look stupid wearing sunglasses indoors. Take those off. RJ, what happened to you? This is nothing. I just stumbled during P.E. class. I know your P.E. class isn't till Friday. Look at your face. You don't look like you stumbled. You look like you got beaten up. That wasn't the case, Mom. I swear I bumped against the edge of a table. You know how much I hate it when you hide things from me. Are you picking fights now? No, Mom. Is someone at school hurting you? I can defend myself, Mom. So you are getting into trouble. - I said I'm not. - Just be honest! Don't make a big deal out of it. You're going to be late. We're not done talking. Help me out here. Place it in the middle. Do it properly. RJ... you know you can talk to me about anything, right? [neigbors chattering] Hey, Simone! Cubao! Cubao! Get inside! Cubao! Cubao! [ominous music playing] You're late. Sorry. I had to wait for my son to get home. That's alright. We'll call it quits when I run late next time. Anyway, our boss told me to give you a tour. Sure. Come. Follow me. Watch out for puddles. Careful not to step on broken glass. You'll be fine as long as you wear shoes. Nevermind all these plastic. They left those out after cleaning out the asbestos. You can wear a mask... if the smell and dust become too much for you. It smells like something's burning. Did something burn here? I don't smell anything. [toy squeaking] I caught a group of teenagers poking around in here once. They said they're spirit seekers. Apparently, the dark energy is high in here. That the building has a dark history. There are lots of different stories about this place. Like what? Hey! Slow down! Wait for me! Sir Renante, what happened here? What are you talking about? Sir? They intentionally burned the place with the kids and nurses still inside. The owner of the compound did that as an offering to the spawns of darkness in exchange for wealth. They paid the media off to keep quiet about it. And to this day, they're still looking for a new sacrifice. [laughs out loud] But of course, those stories aren't true! Silly. It's just like your typical white lady ghost story. It's a made-up story to keep trespassers off the property. So whenever you encounter kids trying to cause any trouble, tell them that story. What happened to Ciel, Sir Renante? I don't know. I just said goodbye to her one night, then the next morning, she just stopped reporting for work. She just vanished. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Enjoy! Also... Don't forget to do your rounds at midnight and at 3:00 AM. Okay? Alright. Thanks. Take care. [phone alarm ringing] [metal clanking] [voice calling] [distant banging] [loud banging] Why did you leave us? You left us to die just for your son. Is your son's life more important than all of ours? [ringtone playing] Good morning, Simone. Good morning. How was your first night? It was fine. Nothing happened. RJ? RJ. RJ, wake up. Ma, I still have 15 minutes. I'll prepare breakfast. Come out when you're ready. Is there a power outage? Our neighbors have their lights on. Our power got disconnected, Ma. I won't get my salary until the 15th. I can look for a job, if you'd like. I can file for a Leave of Absence, Ma. Don't worry about it. I can borrow money from a loan shark. Hey, get up! Let's have breakfast. Hurry up! - Ma. - Ouch. Ma. How was your first night on the job? It was alright! The good thing about that building is I'm all by myself, and it gives me time to think clearly. Are you listening to me? Yes, Ma. You were just telling me you could think clearly there. What about you? How's school? Well-- Everything's good. I'm happy. Are you sure? Of course! It doesn't sound like it. I'll be going now, Ma. Take care of yourself. Are you the lady who needs money? Yes. What's your name? Simone Aragon. Simon... Aragon. Isn't Simon a man's name? My name has an "e" at the end. Your name sounds so classy. My father wanted a son, but he got a daughter instead. Oh. Tell me if that's the correct amount. Don't forget to pay me... on the 16th. Yes. Lady, make sure you pay on time. [neighbor 1] Hi, Sister! [neighbor 2] Where were you last night? [neighbor 1] You already know! I got lucky last night! You're with someone new every night! Aren't you a beauty?! [neighbor 1] You know I am. [neighbor 2] Whatever. [neighbor 1] We're going out tonight. Do you want to join us? [neighbor 2] Where are you going? [neighbor 1] Just in the next town. You'll have plenty of picks there, I promise! [neighbor 2] Just give me their numbers. You know my type! [neighbor 1] Of course I do! [neighbor 2] You have good taste in men! [alarm clock ringing] Be careful. Why? [phone alarm ringing] [cell phone ringing] Hello, RJ? Are you alright? [RJ] Hi, Ma! I'm fine. I'm just checking up on you. Thank you for calling, son. I'm doing fine. Someone sent me a message on Facebook. He said he knows you. He heard about what happened at the bank, and he said he wanted to offer you some help. Really? Yes. He said his name is Lieutenant Michael Corbin. RJ, stop talking to him. Why? Just do as I say. I don't understand why-- RJ, please! Okay, whatever you say. That's too bad. RJ, give me a second. [gasps] Sorry, madam! We're members of the spirit seekers club. How did you get in?! Does the owner know you're here?! We climbed in from the back. We're very sorry, ma'am. This place hasn't had a guard for weeks. Well, I'm here now! Get out of here! Start walking! We just wanted to walk around for a few hours. Why are you holding a wire? This is a dowsing stick. If these two ends touch, that means there's dark energy in that place. I'm Luis, by the way. She's Alice, and this is Marko. Are you all alone here? We could keep you company for a while. Here, have some. Thank you. According to the people we asked, we learned that voices could be heard from the building at night. Sometimes there'd be people crying, and other times, it's like something is burning. Sometimes, there are trespassers that come in, just like you. That story you told us is scary. They burned the kids alive as a sacrifice on purpose? That's what I heard. But did you know, that during the old times, the earliest cultures did the same thing. To ensure a good harvest for that year, they would make human sacrifices. But I'm pretty sure nobody still does that now, right? It's obvious you've never had a job, and had to answer to a boss. Alice! Luis! Come here! Hey, don't be a pervert! Why are you looking at my chest?! You won't find a ghost there! That symbol... represents manhood... and the fires of hell. This is the logo of our security firm. You're just trying to scare me! You just want me to leave, so you can do whatever you want! But guess what? I'm not a coward! Get out of here! We will never come back here. And I suggest you do the same thing. Contact us if you ever need help. One more word and I ll call the police. Get lost! [music intensifies] [phone alarm ringing] [phone alarm ringing] [alarm stops] [breathes in] [footsteps] [taps flashlight] [taps flashlight] [flashlight rattles] Didn't I tell you to leave? Why are you here? If you don't leave, I'm taking you to the police station. Why are you here? Why are you here? What are you doing here? I'm the guard here. Who are you? What's your name? Ciel. [whimpers] [hurried footsteps] [disembodied whispers] [pants] [hurried footsteps] [blood dripping] [blood dripping] [screams in anguish] - [screaming] - [RJ choking] [retching] It feels good, doesn't it? Why are you doing this to me? I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to give you what you've always wanted. I can give you freedom, a better life. You've always wanted freedom, right? I can give that to you. But we're taking your son in return. [whispers menacingly] We're taking your son! We're taking your son! If you won't give him to us, then we will take you. You want to know the truth, Simone? Your son is a liar. He doesn't love you. He's no different from the other men in your life. [blood dripping] - [loud thud] - [horrified scream] [sinister laughter] [gasps] [whimpers] Hey, what are you doing there? Can I be stationed somewhere else? [Sol] Why? I'm sorry, but I can't work at St. Gerard anymore. [Sol] Are you losing your nerve again? No...it's not that, sir-- [Sol] You're staying there. Just do as I say. I have to go now, I'm busy. Okay, sir. Thank you. You work at St. Gerard? Isn't that place haunted? Mind your own business! Sure! No problem. No problem. Okay. Bye! Love you! So, what have you been up to lately? What time did you get home last night? Around 8 PM, I think. Didn't you say you were working on a project? Yeah, we worked on a group project. For what class? Science. - Are you sure? - Yes, Mom. RJ, tell me the truth... Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't. Really? I swear. You have a boyfriend? Fine, I ll tell you the truth. I don't! [RJ laughs] You know... - ...you can tell me anyth-- - What about you, Mom? You have a boyfriend, don't you? No, I don t! How about a girlfriend? Let's just talk about something else. Why? It's not too late! Whatever. RJ... I'm always here if you need to talk to me, okay? Do you think I'm hiding something, Mom? It's not that. I'm sorry. - [music intensifies] - [wheels squeaking] [disembodied voices] [screams] Mom, wake up. What happened? Huh? You dozed off - you should've seen yourself earlier. You were staring off into space the whole time. Next thing I now, you're dozing off. Anyway, I have to go, Mom. [water dripping] We only take in high school graduates, I'm sorry. You don't need a college degree to work as a cashier. Besides, I'm pretty good with numbers, you know. Look, miss. We don't make the rules here, the head company does. They're the ones looking for high school graduates. That's not fair. There's nothing I can do, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, ma'am. But we're looking for high school graduates. [sniffs] [neighbors chattering] [disembodied voice] I will take your son. [screams] - [whispering continues] - Shut up! [alarm clock ringing] [ringing stops] [indistinct whispers] [crying] We're taking your son with us. If you don't give him to us, then you'll die. [cries helplessly] [screams] [heavy breathing] - [blows out candle] - [alarm ringing] [screeches] [music intensifies] Hey, Mom. I'm home. How are you? Did you sleep well? I'm okay. How was school? It was fine. What did you take up today? Uh... Algebra. We also celebrated Teacher Appreciation Day. - Were you dismissed early? - No. Really? Yes, Mom. Is that all? We studied a bit for English, and after that my friends and I played basketball. I'm glad you're taking your studies seriously. At least I know all my sacrifices have been worth it. Working as a night shift guard isn't easy, you know? Let me help you, Mom. It's fine. I got it. What do you want to do for your birthday? Nothing, Mom. Why don't you invite your teachers and friends over? I'll throw a party. You don't have to, Mom. It's okay. You told me your teachers are very fond of you. And your group study friends - you're close to them, right? Right? You can invite them over. Hey, you're late again. Renante, can we trade shifts? You take the night shift, I'll take the day shift. I can't. I have to pick up my wife from work. Come on. Why? Just do it. Boss trusted you with this, remember? Ciel said the same thing before she disappeared. She disappeared? What do you mean? Before she left, I mean. That's not what you said! She left, okay? Were you even listening to me? Anyway, I'm going home. [alarm ringing] [alarm goes off tune] [screaming] [panting] [screaming] They're all the same. See? You ungrateful brat! How dare you complain?! Lie down! [yells] Simon, please stop! Simon! You selfish brat! It's your fault she's spoiled rotten! Simon! Isn't this what you've always wanted to do? Mike, I gave you everything! I quit school for you! I moved to Angeles City! This is all I ask of you-- I am not going to let you get a goddamn abortion! Please! Listen to me. You're just jealous. If you get an abortion, I'll take you to jail! [cries in pain] He's just like all the men in your life. [baby crying] It's in his blood. He'll just hurt you. [baby crying] You remember when you were pregnant with your son? All you did was suffer and cry in pain. You couldn't even eat nor sleep. [baby crying] What about your dreams? What now, huh? You want to fight back? You've got a lot of guts showing up here. If I see you here again, you're not walking out of here alive. Got it? Mom. I just tripped during P.E. class. You'd be much better off if he weren't around. Give him to us, and you will finally be free. [sinister laughter] Yes, it's my birthday. It's okay... if you send the money late. My celebration can wait. Sure, sure. Okay, bye! Love you! Who was that? Nobody. Who were you asking money from? I told you, I wasn't talking to anyone. Give me your phone. I said, give me your phone! Mom, stop it! Who said you could talk to your father? How did you get his number? I just didn't want you to spend-- After everything I've done for you?! He's still my father! You think that's all it takes to be a parent? He gives you money and suddenly he's a father, huh?! What about me?! I'm the reason you're alive! Did you even care about how I'd feel?! You only care about money. What good has he even done for you?! Pass on his seed?! It's all about money to you. You greedy little brat! I'm sorry-- I'll take care of your birthday party. Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. Oh! Hey there, beautiful. What took you so long? I'm sorry. "Sorry." Hmph! Hey, where's the rest of it? Pay in full already! You told me I can pay you in three days. Yes, three days but with full payment. That's why it's on the 16th, remember?! I don't have it yet. Give me three days. Come on, you don't have cash? Fine. Here's what we'll do. You don't always have to pay in cash. You can pay me in some other way, you know? Do that again and I'll kill you. W-wait, please--! I'm so sick of men like you! You gave me three days! Yes, yes! Three days! I'm sorry! You better pay up in three days! Or else! I'm sure your classmates will be here soon. Filipino time, you know. Mom, the invitation says 3 o'clock. It's almost 5 o'clock. Just relax. Okay? I'm heading out. [knocking on door] [knocking on door] Good afternoon, ma'am! Good afternoon. I'm Madel, RJ's teacher. Oh! Please come in. Thank you. RJ just went out with his friends. Sit down, please. It's good to know RJ has some friends again. - Excuse me? - Oh, what I meant was... I'm concerned for your son. Why? Well, he told me he's looking after you since you can't work for the time being. That's why he's stopped coming to school. Madam? I'll talk to him. Alright. If you ever need anything, let me know so I can refer you to someone who can help. Just let me know. Thank you. Okay, then. I hope you can visit the school soon, so we can talk some more during our PTA meetings. Sure. Oh and please give this to RJ. I should go. Alright, have a good day. [door closes] [disembodied voices] [crying] [disembodied voices] [crying] [cries desperately] [disembodied voice] Kill him. He's a liar. He deserves to die. Enjoy. [disembodied voice] Simone. - [disembodied voices] - What do you want from me? Why don't you just leave me alone?! RJ, what are you doing here? I know you spoke with Ms. Madel. I'm sorry. I've done nothing wrong. Please forgive me. If you want, I'll accompany you with your rounds. I'm sorry, dear. It wasn't your fault, Mom. Thanks. Come on, let's do your rounds. - How can you stand the smell? - [phone rings] It's just something you have to get used to. [phone ringing] - [phone ringing] - This is tough. It's insane. Yeah. - [phone ringing] - Wait, I need to take this. [phone ringing] Hello? [RJ] Hello, Mom? I'm sorry I walked out on you earlier. I just went to school. I'm on my way home now. But I think I left my keys at home. Do you have a spare key somewhere? Hello? Mom? - [fluid matter sludging] - [RJ] Hello? Mom? [fluid matter sludging] [slurping] Kill him! It feels good, doesn't it? It's liberating! Your life would be so much better without him. Finish him. [Simone screams] Good morning. Good morning. So are you going to finish the job? Yes. You were right about him. That's good. Boss will be happy to hear that. Set yourself free. [sinister laugh] [chanting] [fluid matter sludging] [chanting continues] You're a liar. You're just like your good-for-nothing father. Mom, what are you doing? How dare you. You wasted everything your mother has done for you. - That's not true-- - Shut up! You think I didn't know you've been skipping school? How dare you! Please, Mom... I'm going to kill you. Yes, I skipped my classes. I've been selling stuff online to help you because I know you've been struggling with your job. I just wanted to help you. Don't listen to him, Simone. He's lying. As long as you're his mother... you will never be free! Who are you talking to? I didn't choose to be your mother. And yet I chose to have you. And this is how you'll repay me? Mom... You lied to me! I will never forgive you! Please, Mom! You lied to me! You deserve to die for lying to me! You let all my sacrifices go to waste! That's not true. I didn't want to go to school anymore. I was being bullied. They were beating me up. My classmates lost their relatives during the robbery. My Uncle Nestor should've been alive. I couldn t stand how they were blaming us for it so I stood up for you. [sobbing] Mom... If you don't want to be with me anymore, it's fine. I can look after myself. [Simone] I knew I was about to die. That's when I realized how much I love my son, and how much he loves me back. Even though he set me free, I'd still choose to be with him, not because I'm supposed to, but because I wanted to. You know what, doc, I almost died. I flatlined for one minute. The blade went in half an inch into my gut. If it weren't for RJ's help, I wouldn't be here. I don't know why I didn't tell him sooner that something was bothering me. Well, Simone... people don't often wonder how their mothers are doing. We have this notion that being a mother... is the only way a woman can find fulfillment. But sometimes... No, it's just not true. How are you feeling? How's your health? I feel fine. I sometimes experience some episodes but I can handle it. Well, based on the results and the progress you've made, we can already lower your dosage. But doc, why do I still hear voices whispering to me? We all have our demons. But the important thing is to continue fighting these demons and believe we can overcome them. 20 bucks! By the way, Ms. Tinay called. It s urgent. She just placed orders for perfume. So who's doing the delivery - you or me? I'll do it. Alright, Mom. Anyway, what did the doctor say? She lowered the dosage of my meds. [chuckles] That's great! Come here. Mom. I'm fine. It's nothing. I just saw an old friend pass by.
