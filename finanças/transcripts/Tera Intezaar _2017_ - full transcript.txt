You never told us about this painting. Gorgeous, sexy and seductive. How dare you, Get out! Raunak! Raunak. And I don’t know what happened after that. When I woke up, I was alone there. Veer was not there and also those four. And I left from there worried. You were injured but nothing happened to you. And those disappeared who were not injured. Stop. Your story is very deep, tomorrow will be a different day for you. Your destiny is close, but reaching there is very difficult.
