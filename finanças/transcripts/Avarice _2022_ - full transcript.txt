Thomas? Hm-hmm? I've decided I'm going on a holiday. What!? Where? Sydney. Why? I need a break. A break? From what? A break from you Thomas. Who the hell? Can you answer it? Hang on! Hello Thomas. Thomas? Tom? - Who are you? - Get back. Move. I have money. I can pay you... Ryker wants us out by 2300. Let's get it done. It's your daily wake-up service. Morning. How are you feeling? Tired. Yeah, and now you're ready for the tournament right? Yeah, I'll be fine. Dad's coming to support me seeing as you can't make it. Yeah I know, I'm sorry. Shall I wake up Sarah? Ah no don't. She said she doesn't want to come. Really? Hm-hmm. I don't know what to do with her Ash. Well we're going on a weekend away so maybe that will help. Yeah maybe. I'll try and get her into the psych this afternoon. Do you want to come? I can't. I've got work. Yep. No, that's fine. I know she's talented, but you're better. I don't know Dad. I barely made it into the finals. You can do this. Remember, have courage, take risks. The prize is within reach. Exactly. It's that mantra that helped me win a world title. You can too. Thanks Dad. Nine to Liz Knight. Nine for Matthews. Eye of the storm. Ten for Liz Knight. Ten. Matthews scores ten with her second arrow. Nine. That's 28 out of 30 for Knight. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for Kate Matthews to see if she can beat 28. Forgive me. Well done. Thanks. Hey I was bound to beat you eventually, right? You're so good now. Oh, I think you were off your game today. Go celebrate. You won! Second place is still pretty damn good. I sucked. I can't seem to concentrate. Oh really? How's things with Ash? We're trying to work it out. We're going down south for a short holiday with Sarah tomorrow. Sounds nice. Why don't you come down on Sunday? I'll see. I've got a lot on. Everything okay? She wants to see you. Do you think this is helping, Sarah? There's nothing wrong with Sarah. She's a perfectly normal teenager. She doesn't talk. She's withdrawn. She doesn't want to participate. I mean, that can't be normal. That's typical behaviour for anxiety. Anxiety? I understand you and Ash are having some marital problems. Are you saying that I make my daughter anxious? You and your husband. Look. I can see you're going through a tough situation. But it's up to married couples to show their children how to... Show them what? How to be happy. Could you go any slower honey? Do we really need to bring the bow? Yes we do. It needs a restring. Okay, no worries. - Who are you texting? - None of your business. Hey Ben, what's up? The Shanghai fund's just landed. Waiting for it to clear later today, but it looks like it's going to be the whole thirty. Great work, Benny. Alright, let's get Thomas paid his nice kicker on the deal. Have you told him? He's not been in yet today. Well give him a call. I have. He's not picking up. That's weird. I think he's still pissed with you. Me? I didn't force him out. It was his own choice to leave. Yep. Well, I guess it was just bad timing on his half, eh? That's business, Benny. Not everyone can be a winner. I'll try him again. All right, thanks. You okay? If it means your work's done for the weekend, I am. Yeah, it's sorted now. Family time, promise. What do you think? Yeah, it's pretty nice. All right. That's a pretty great view. Thought you'd like it. - Dad! - Yeah, hang on. Hang on. Oh, hey. Hey there. Heard the alarm. Oh yeah, sorry. I forgot to enter the code. My apologies. That's okay. If you need anything, let me know. Thank you. Knock, knock ladies. This place is pretty great, Ash. Yeah, I know, right? What do you reckon, Sarah? Yeah, it's cool. Hey, why don't we go explore the forest? Now that's a good idea. What do you think? Do we have to? Come on, now. It's gonna be fun. Got your phone! Let's go my love! Oh, look how much you've grown up. - Who is this guy? - Give me my phone! Thomas, it's Ash. I've been trying to reach you all day. The Shanghai deal is closed, mate. Give me a call when you free. Any word? Still nothing. I thought you promised no work while you were here. Yeah, I'm sorry. He always gets back to me. Maybe he's just spending time with his wife. Susan? Yeah. He must be. - Hey. - Hey. Just wanted to come in and say goodnight. Everything okay? I hope you and Dad can work things out. We are trying. I know. Oh Sarah, I'm sorry. Sorry? For putting you through all this. You know it's not your fault, right? Yeah. And it's not your fault either, Mum. Get some sleep, yeah? Yeah, ten more minutes. I've heard that one before. Second bottle? Well, I'm celebrating. Want me to pour you a glass? Sure. - Hmm. - Not bad? I think this weekend's going to be good for her. Yeah. Fresh air will help. I think it's the fact that we're all together for once. True. So cheers. Cheers to us. I need more time, Ash. So I guess I'm sleeping downstairs? Please. Well can we talk about it? I don't want to. Not tonight. Sweet dreams. Hey, not yet. We haven't got clearance. From who? Ryker! He's here? Yeah. He's out there somewhere. He'll text us when we're ready. Wake up! Jesus Christ! Ryker says that they've put the perimeter alarm on. - You know the code, right? - Yeah. - Do you know the code? - Yes! Good. So here's the plan of the house. You get the kid, I'll get the parents. Don't kill her, all right? Yeah, I won't. And we're up. The phones are jammed. Ash! Kate? Kate! Shhhh. Kate! Kate! Kate! Hey! Hey! Kate? Who the hell are you? You're going to do exactly as I fucking say. We good? Put this in. - What's this? - Military grade. Ryker put a relay in the forest. Can you handle them? Yeah, you can trust me. Hey, there she is. Welcome back, Katey. You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right? Look Kate, it's really simple. Do as you're told or I kill your kid, right? Yeah? Good. Oh shit! Where's my wife and daughter? They're safe. Fuck! Please, fuck! Beg me. Please? - Beg me. - Please! Fuck. Ah shit! What the hell is this? You're a smart guy. What do you want? Your money, Ash! This is a fucking robbery? See? I just said you were a smart guy. But it's not really a robbery, is it? It's more of a quiet transaction. Three systems. Three servers. Three different ISPs. Clear? I can't. You can't what? My business partner has the matching set of codes to access the funds. Only he knows his codes, so I can't do it. No, if that's not correct, the system shuts you out. It's not like an ATM. You get one chance. It's the right code. How'd you get the code? We asked him for it. Do it, Ash. Whatever they want you to do. - Tom. - Just do it. - Please! - Okay, I see, I see. So! I want you to transfer ten million dollars into three separate accounts. Okay? You have three hours. I need way more than that. No. No fucking way. It takes time to reroute that much, okay? There are limit protocols in place. Limit protocols? Yeah, I can't just transfer ten million dollars in one go. I think it's just a million at a time. Well... You can take all the time you need. But your wife and kid, they're gonna be dead in three hours unless the transaction is done. You get it? Yeah all right, I'll do it, okay? I'll do it, okay? No argument, all right? Then turn the fuck around. All right. Okay. Fuck! Yeah, you have got some spunk, Kate. I have to say. I'm impressed. Do you realise, I could do whatever the fuck I want to you? It's like your life is completely in my hands. And yet you still fight me. Brave or stupid, Kate. Which one are you, huh? That's my girl. Give me your hands. It's okay. It's okay. You do realise the program needs both our retina scans before anything can be finalised? You don't get it. Thomas needs to scan as well. There are fail-safes in place. What the hell is that? Open it and find out. Oh fuck! Jesus! So we've already scanned Thomas's eye. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Your choice. Attaboy! Okay Sarah, you have to pull your hand out. Pull. Pull, baby. I know it hurts. Pull. Pull. Come on, pull. Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, pull. Hide it. Hide it, hide it. Holy shit, Kate. I have to say you are one lucky lady. This place is very, very fancy. All right look, I think I need a coffee because if I just stand here staring at you two, I'll probably doze off and then, God knows what will happen. Hey, but no funny business, all right? Otherwise I will have to beat the shit out of both of you. You know I bet you it's automatic, right? The coffee machine. You rich people. - This is Kane. - Checking in. All good? Ah, yeah, no, everything is ah... running smoothly. Good. By tonight, you're going to be very rich. Copy that. Shhhh. Baby, look at me. Come on. Here baby, let's go. You son of a bitch! Okay, he's coming. - Baby, I need you to run. - No, no, no! Look at me. Look at me. You can be our hero. I need you to run. Go, baby. Go. Go! No! Yeah, I bet you discovered all the doors are locked huh? Yeah, well unfortunately for you, Katey, I am the only one with the fucking keys. When I find you Kate... ...I am going to carve my name in your back. Teach you a real good fucking lesson. That wasn't brave, Kate. That was really, really stupid. But I did say I was impressed. You okay? Is he dead? I don't know. Sarah, give me some zip ties. Sarah, zip ties! How do you like that? You bastard! - Status? - Proceeding as planned. - Copy that. - You? We're good. Just make the transfers. Copy that, sir. Try that again and I will fucking slit your throat. Okay. Where's my husband? Where's my husband! Fuck you, is where. You know when Reed gets back she is going to punish you both big time. Who the hell is she? Reed? A maniac. Yeah? Well I can get pretty crazy, too. Especially when you threaten my family. Yeah, not like her. She's ex-Army. Served in Syria. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Hey, why don't you ask Mummy to untie me and I'll... I'll ask her to go easy on you two, huh? Hope your jaw hurts. Sarah! Okay. Sarah, I need you to go next door, and I need you to get the neighbours to call the cops, okay? Can you come with me? No baby, I've got to stay here and watch him. You can do this, okay? - Okay. - Go. Help us, please! Oh please! Please! Hey, what's happening? We had a home invasion. They took Dad. I need you to call the police. Okay, just breathe. Take deep breaths. You're safe now. Where's your mother? She's inside, watching one of them. - She caught one? - Yeah, he's all tied up. Is he really? Oh, you poor girl. Come inside, quickly. Now, it's going to be okay. Have a seat. Okay. I'm gonna call the police, and then we're gonna go help your parents. - Okay? - Yeah. Hello, yes, this is an emergency. We've had a home invasion. Yes. 5 Cambey Way. Thanks. Thank you. Kane, update. Kane. Ryker, no response from the house. Need you to check status. I repeat. Need you to check status. For fuck's sake! What? They're not responding. - Both of them? - Yes. Keep your sidearm drawn. Stay two metres away. - What's up? - You. Get outside now. Keep your eyes on the perimeter. No one in, no one out. You know it can't be comms, right? We've double checked all our gear. I don't know. Wait. What if... What if they're compromised? What the hell do we do? No one is compromised, do you hear me? They just don't have their comms on. It happens. This! That's the job, okay? - Okay. - Good. Eyes up. Mum! Are you okay? Did you call the police? We did. They're on their way. You got a real little soldier here. Yeah, I'm proud of her. You should be. Who's that loser? He's just some dickhead who broke in. Jesus! What a complete fucking idiot. There have been a few break-ins around here recently. I installed a new alarm as well. Then again, my father would have said, "You don't need an alarm if you've got good neighbours." Did they say how long they were going to be? What? The police. Did they say how long they're going to be? Oh. They said an hour. An hour? We're less than thirty minutes from town. They must be busy. Yeah. You didn't ask me where my husband was. - What's going on, Mum? - Sarah, don't move. Well I thought I gave a convincing performance. Get the girl. No! No! No! No! No! Oh fuck! Shut the fuck up! Watch her! I'll take care of this. Where are you? Come on, Kate. We've got Sarah! Kate! Drop the knife. Are you fucking serious? What are you doing? - I'm done. - It's sent? No. What do you mean, no? I want to check on my family. I want proof they're safe. - Listen, arsehole... - No, you listen, arsehole! I'm not sending one cent until I know my family is safe. You there? What is it? This arsehole wants proof of life before he makes a transfer. - Repeat, he wants proof... - I heard you. - Mick? - Yeah. Bring out the hostage. We need to move this along. Will do. This fucking family. - Thomas! - Ash. I couldn't do anything. They killed my wife. - Oh my God. Susan? - She's dead. He's told us about the security protocols you put in the system, Ash. We know it alerts the authorities. You've gotta fix it. Come on, Ash. Just do it. It's only money. - I can't. - Please. Fix it Ash, or I'll kill him right here. Okay. Okay. I'll fix it. You have my word. - Please. - Please. Ryker! Is everything okay up there? - What the hell happened? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. That fucking woman! That fucking woman, all right? She has skills. Ryker went up there to take care of her but it's gone quiet. He isn't coming back! I think that bitch has killed him. Well get up there and sort this shit out now. You fucking do it. This is your mess. Look what she did to my fucking face! Yeah? And I'll do much worse. Now you get up there and you fucking get her now! Fuck! Get up. Get up. Get up. Want to watch your Mum die? Sarah, you okay honey? Yeah she's fine, Kate. Hey, why don't you come on down and we'll have a chat, huh? Why don't you let my daughter go and I'll spare you? That's very funny. Remember, I'm the one with the gun. Fuck this. Hi, Kate. Let her go. Don't fucking move. Please just let her go. Put the bow down. Put the fucking bow down. Get on your knees. You shut the fuck up. Don't move. Hands behind your back. It's okay, baby. Shut the fuck up. Look at me. - Look at me. - What are you doing? Your husband wants proof of life. What? Why? Who the fuck is that? I don't know. If you make a sound, I will gut you. Do you hear me? Hello. Oh, hello. Is Kate here? Yeah. Ah, who are you? Her father. Oh, it's nice of you to come visit. Come in. She's just in the lounge. What the hell! Sarah! Kate! Look, just do as she says. Just do as she says. Don't you just love family reunions? So touching. No! No! No! Oh my God, Dad! No! - I told you not to fuck with me. - I didn't! Don't! She's my Mum. Please! You're tough. I like that. You know in another life, we probably could have been friends. I doubt that. Okay. No! I'm taking your daughter as insurance. If you call the cops, she's dead. If you leave this house, she's dead. - Do you understand? - Yes. I'm being merciful. You can thank me later. We all good here? Yeah, almost there. Have you got a spare clip? Yeah, sure brother. Hey. Any plans with your cut? - Nah, mate. - Come on. Job like this? Don't tell me you haven't thought about it. Let me guess. A Ferrari. Am I right? Kate. Kate. Kate. Dad? Oh God! Hold on. Hold on. Daddy? Daddy. Remember what I said. What? Have courage. Get your family back. What? No! I can't. She broke my bow. My bow's in my car. Do what you know. I love you, Kate. No, no. No, no, no, no. No. No, Dad! Dad? No! No, Daddy, please! Oh no. No! No... No... Come on. Got you. Visitor. - Are you okay? - I am. - This fucking family. - Don't you hurt her! Please, don't hurt my daughter. Don't worry about her, Ash. Finish the fucking transaction. Where's my wife? Alive. Just. What have you done to her? I taught her a fucking lesson. Now wrap this up. The last million is transferring. - Check it. - It's done. It was the right thing to do, Ash. Come on. It's all there. Well done, boss. Fuck me, Thomas. You're behind all of this? What have you done? Your... It was Susan's. You betrayed me. You betrayed us. Everything we worked for. You put my family's lives in jeopardy! How dare you? How fucking dare you talk to me about deception. You slept with my wife, Ash. Yes! Of course I knew. It was a mistake. Oh, you're telling me. My wife is dead because of you. Because of your greed to take everything. To steal my business. To even fuck my wife. Well... Now, you're gonna pay. What was it you said again? Ah... Oh yeah, yeah. It's business. Not everyone can be a winner. Kane and Ryker are dead. What? How? How? She killed them. What the hell was that? She's here! Hold her off a bit longer. I just need to confirm the transfers. Will do. Don't mess around. She's a trained archer. Shoot to kill. Come on. Finally! It's confirmed. - So it's all there? - Yep. Don't even fucking try it. Dad! The gun! - Sarah? - Mum! I'm okay. I'm okay. I got this. It's all good. - You go. - Okay. Be careful. Yeah, that's not coming undone. Dad! Watch out, Dad! Stop it! You can break into my house. You can steal my money. But don't you ever threaten my fucking family! Oh my God! That's for the arrow, bitch! You couldn't just leave it alone. I got you now, bitch! Mum. Mum! Kate! Kate! Sarah? - Having fun? - Yeah. How's the leg? Hurts... No, it's good. It's all right. Hey guys, look. Look what I found. A sea urchin. - Wow. - Cool. Let me see. Did you know the sea urchin's closest relatives are actually sea cucumbers? Cucumbers? - Not those cucumbers, Mum. - Oh. I don't know! And they mostly eat seaweed. Oh yeah? Well I like seaweed in soshi. - Sushi! - It's Sushi? - No, it's sushi. - Give it back. Thank you. She seems happier. I think she's more relieved than happy. True. What about you? Me? Us? I've given it a lot of thought. And? Yeah, I'll give you one last chance. Really? But God help me Ash, if you fuck up again, I'm probably going to have to kill you. I don't doubt it. - I love you. - Same. Ew, guys! Come here, Mum.
