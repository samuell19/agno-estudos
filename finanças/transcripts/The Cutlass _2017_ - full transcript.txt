Although it's counterintuitive, if you ever find yourself in one, simply surrender. Swim along the shore until you have escaped its grasp. Once free, you can swim safely to land. Finally! I thought you were gonna grow scales! You were in there for so long! Yeah, I haven't been surfing in forever. Yeah, I know. But it's so good to see you, though. We never get to lime anymore.

You wanna be of any use? Help me pack the truck. - OK. - What? Honey! You're in no shape to go. That is absolutely unnecessary. I can assure you that the police is quite equipped to handle the situation. Oh, so then you can also assure me of another unsolved case? Hey hey hey, listen, listen.

Please, yes. I used to hike this area before I got sick. We take half the amount of time if we use the running trail that cuts through this hill. If we can then get your men up on this plateau, you'd be able to see all of Toco; it has the best vantage point and it isn't hard to get down from. I have another map I can show you. I will get back your daughter. One of us will. Come over in here and then it's here, and then down in here and then this is the trail. Yeah. There's a trail right here that we can drive on. OK.

He's the only hope I have for finding my way out. At first, I hoped we would encounter someone, anyone. But now I'm not so sure. Anyone we run into this far in isn't here for a good reason. Take dem clothes off. Way. How you freezing so? Why you doh take dem clothes off? You will get sick. I don't want to. It had this one time I went to the river wit' mih brodda and he friend.

Feel guilty? For what? Anything? Everything? Hm. The slow conversation from wrongness to rightness is a personal process one goes through when the mind processes things of the past, which have made us the people who we are today. Justice for oneself. Bullshit. Hey. Watch your tone. Fine, fine. I'll let you talk to them. When? When I ready. But we have to go out there. On the left-hand side, there's a road.

The person collecting the money is not gonna know where I am. And the kidnapper, he'll know, and he'll, they'll, they'll kill me. Joanna! A smart girl. We don't have that kind of money.

Writers write 'cause they have something to say. Well, you will have plenty to say now. Something seriously wrong with you. You're fucking up my whole life, my family... I don't give a fuck. Really, I could really care less. A man have to look out for himself, first and foremost. If is one thing Georgie teach me, he right. A man is always in control. What about women? Women? Woman should never be in control. So who you gonna share all your money with? Mihself. And mih girl, if da is what yuh getting at. Yeah, girl who you treat so well, I'm sure. Shh.

Woman! Yuh cyah run from me, gyal. Where do you think you're going? Eh? I will give yuh a head start. Is this necessary? Trust? Trust and love is an illusion. A myth. Life taught me that. The only real thing is power. You can't just take power. Eh-heh? Who say so, you? Who have none right now? They just a bunch ah cowards. They doh have the smarts to get away with what I doing. You feel this is smart? Both of us might end up dead. And even if not, what're you gonna do, run forever? From the police? From the man by the river? From Georgie? You're the coward. Hm. Who is the coward now, eh? Sit down. You're right. I could never survive out here alone. But you can. Yeah, doh worry. I'll take care of you. Your plan's gonna work. When you get the money, you can start a new life. Yeah. You outsmarted everyone. Just a bunch ah cowards. Cowards. Al. Please. No more foolishness? I will never forget what that emptiness in his eyes showed me. For him, hope was an illusion. Dis wha I could plan. But for me, it's all I have. Doh forget to tell dem come alone eh. With a cellphone. And, no police. I practiced it a million times. A million and one is better. Drive to Toco and stop by the telephone substation. Once there, call for further directions. Make sure you're alone, the windows are down, and the lights are on inside. The kidnapper said if there's any sign of police involvement, the deal is off and they'll kill me. Follow instructions, my release is guaranteed. OK? No police! Hello? We got the call, meet us in the village. What about the exchange? I don't know. We have to wait for further instructions. We are on our way now, the police say they have a plan. Okay. What's happening? I don't know yet. Dem police rel incompetent, yuh know. You know how long dem trying to catch me? You've done something like this before? Plenty ah dem worse than me, yuh know. Corrupt. They does lie. Smile in yuh face and spit in yuh back. At least I real. Call. Fuckers better not try anything, yuh know. Hello? Yeah. Park in de middle ah de road and walk a mile to the clearing. Wha'ever! Just no police! Boots. What? Boots! I thought you tell me yuh fadder dying. He good enough to take yuh mudda place. Just stay here. As a matter of fact, I can't leave yuh just so, darling. Hoo! Where's Joanna?

Go home now. I heard a gunshot. It's nothing. It just went off. Nobody got hurt. You're lying! It's killing me. I can't believe I let him get away. Oh Jake, there's nothing you could have done. Honey, you have to have faith. She's gonna come home. God, I hope so. Help! Help! Please! Please! Help! It's okay. It's okay. You're hurt. No, don't worry about me, let it go. Don't worry about me. I'm just glad you're safe. I love you so much. I love you so much. Look who's here. Hi. I promise I didn't read it. Drop your weapon, this over. Not over! The spore of despair spreads deep in the decay of self-worth. There, beneath the canopy of cruelty, where the light of love and trust are seldom shone. But there is freedom for none who secretly savor the pain and let it be their keeper. I not afraid ah you. Drop the weapon. Take him down! Let justice be the real casualty. Dad, you fought a brave battle. Now, you're free. I need no illusions of reprise, or other emotional fiction, for I have my faith in God, and my faith in myself, to be my lasting conviction.
