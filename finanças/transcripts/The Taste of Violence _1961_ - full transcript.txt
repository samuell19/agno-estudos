THE TASTE OF VIOLENCE Central America in the early 20th century... In the Oriente province, General Guzman's "Guerilleros", during a merciless fight, have put all their forces into overthrowing President Laragama's regime. They have ambushed Laragama's daughter to use her as an hostage. Welcome to President Laragama's daughter. Miss... I've been ordered to take you to General Guzman, head of the provisional revolutionary government. I don't recognize your government. Be warned that it's gonna be a long journey. It depends upon you whether or not it is pleasant. How dare you take it out on me? You and your men are going to be hanged! Till that high day, Miguel you take command. We'll meet in two weeks at Salte de la muerta. Chamaco! Chico! You're coming with me. Get some food and take the best horses. Get her some different clothes, too. I refuse! I won't wear them. If you prefer, I can ask my men to undress you. Go! Ready! Aim! Fire! She refuses to eat. So what? She probably doesn't like it. Do you realize? The President's daughter! Do you know Cordova's Madonna? Yes, so? She looks like her. She's so beautiful! Madonna or not, I'm sure she's worth her 4 or 5 million pesos. Maybe even 10. Do you think that much? Much more. How much? Something priceless. Blood. 50 of our comrades have been condemned to death. A President's daughter is well worth 50 revolutionaries. - If you want to know what I think... - I don't! Go get some sleep. I'll take the first shift. No, no... I don't get it. - What? Listen. If we had been killed during the train attack, do you think General Guzman would have came to the rescue? Certainly not. So why give him such a present? It's not fair. He set up the kidnapping. The girl belongs to him. I disagree. It's unfair. What's unfair? Don't get angry but, if we trade the girl for prisoners... Do you know any of those people? Do you think they're still alive? I only think to one thing: the pesos. - What pesos!? If we asked for a ransom, the old man would agree to pay 10 million. That's a lot of money. More than 3 million for each of us. - No way! Okay, you're the boss: 5 for you. Chico and I, we split the rest. Okay? You don't get it, Chamaco. That girl doesn't belong to us, she belongs to the people. And we are the people, aren't we? Let me explain you... Why are we fighting? Because we're starving and we want it to change. And that's our chance! The revolution isn't a chance. It's a holy cause. - Yeah, big words. But they aren't gonna warm us up after your revolution kills us. Listen, Chamaco... I've been ordered to take the girl to Guzman and I'm gonna do it. Is that clear? No. The government troops! Let's get in there! - The mule walked off. - Idiot! You should have been more careful! - Keep her mouth shut! - Stop it! Pardon me, Excellency. Thank you for stopping my mule. Do you expect me to believe that this mule is yours? Certainly, Excellency. Then why did it walked away from you? I was asleep, Excellency. Asleep... A lazybones and a mule thief, that's what you are! Sergeant, take this mule, I confiscate it on behalf of the Government! But, Excellency!... Yes? Pardon me, Excellency. I'd like to speak to Paco. Is he here? - Are you a friend of Paco? - Yes. You're coming from far away? Yes. And you came all that way to see him? I was around. What's your name? If you're a friend, he has probably spoken of you. Oh, Paco's coming. Perez... - What are you doing here? - I'd like to speak with you. Come in. Trouble? Yes. The President's daughter? You already know about it? Yes, some soldiers came yesterday. They're looking for you. There are rewards on your heads. 100 000 pesos. That's a sum. Well, what can I do for you? We lost our supplies. We need a mule and some food. Yes... We'd better wait for nightfall. 100 000 pesos, that's enough to make people think. It's fine, I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - Where are you staying? Up there, in the ruins of the monastery. - Where is she? - In the chapel. - What is she doing? - Dunno. She's praying, huh? Good for her. Why? Yeah, good for her. Why? Think... If we can't trade her... you know, for prisoners... We've lost a lot of time. Maybe they're already dead. Perez' friends. And so? So what's Guzman gonna do if we bring him the girl? Dunno. He'll take revenge on her, don't you think? - He can't do that! - Want to know what I think? A bullet in the head. That's what your Madonna can expect. Unless she end up at the end of a rope. - Can we prevent it? - Yes, we can. But there is Perez. If I could rely on you I could maybe find a way. - How? What's Paco doing? It's almost daytime, he should already be here. - Maybe he gave us up. - Why? To get the bounty. It's fine, it's Paco. You have the mule. - Yes. Chico, put the mule with the horses! So, was everything okay? Yes, kind of, but I felt like I was followed on the way up. Villagers? Yes. And I think you'd better leave... - Perez! The horses have been stolen! They won't lose sight of you and when you're exhausted, they'll attack! - They want more than the horses. - Then, what? Can't you guess? Wait, I'm gonna scare them. Let me handle it. So? What are you expecting? Come on, go home and let us through. Go ahead. Let's go. Listen... I have an idea. Come on, walk straight ahead. Quickly! So where's my profit? A mule for an old bark, admit it's a good deal. A mule isn't very helpful for fishing! Anyhow, don't expect to go fishing now! What are we waiting for? - They're gonna open fire if we go. - He's right. They won't dare open fire after they see her. Move and I shoot. Get on the bark! Now that they've spotted us, they won't get off our backs. They probably went around the lake and sent patrols all over. They must be searching the woods to try and surprise us. We must reach Diego's place as quickly as possible. We can say it was a close shave. What do you think, Chamaco? If you want to know, this is only the beginning. We're gonna end up dead. It's not a woman we have with us, it's dynamite. Dynamite that is worth a lot of gold and that we should trade before it's too late. Don't you say anything? Me and Chico, we did a lot of thinking... I think it's time to tell you about it. I'm listening. We agreed on this, me and him. We'd like to hand the girl over and get the ransom. Is that true, Chico? - It could be better, don't you think? - Of course, if you're with us... you get your share. What if I'm not with you? Then I'll have to think about it. Then think about it! In the meantime, I'll have a look around. You're not alone on this earth! Try to understand that! It's difficult. Yeah, I know. That's the problem. Wait for me. What did he mean? Stories! There's nothing to expect. He's crazy! He only think about the others! But we're not gonna die for nothing! No, no... I'm not into this. This time, we have to be done with him. There's no other option. It's now or never... - You're crazy! What are you gonna do? - Are you with me or not? - I am, but why now? Like this? I tell you it's now or never. I thought about it. He's not wary yet. So it's gonna be easier. We could try to explain to him one more time. Explain what? That I'm gonna ice him? Because he doesn't think like us and doesn't agree about the ransom?... No! That's the only thing to do. If we don't kill him now, it will be too late. We'd lost everything. The girl... the ransom... ...Life. You can be sure of that. Don't move, I'll be right back. - What if you miss him? - Not a chance. I'm used to it. - But he's the chief... The chief, the chief... And so? What does it mean? A bullet in the head, and then you become the chief, or me! Let me handle that. Then... we return the girl, and get the pesos. Watch her carefully. Be careful! He shoots better than you do. Yes, I know. Perez... I didn't know about it, I swear. About what? Chamaco... Our friend Perez is lucky. Two Government soldiers, can you believe that? He didn't notice them. He was walking leisurely. It's lucky I happened to be there! Hurry up! Maybe there are more patrols around. Now that we have horses, we're sure to arrive at Diego's place before nightfall. Come on. She'll sleep here and you'll stay at the door. - Say, Perez... - Yes? Tomorrow... Could we stop by San Felipe? - Why? - My mother lives there. I'd like to say hello to her. We have no time. - Alright. - Chico... Is it true you didn't know about it? I didn't know about what? I don't know. That's what you said this afternoon. I said nothing. Don't you remember? - No. - Then I must be wrong. But if I were you, I wouldn't listen to Chamaco too much! Why do you say that? Because I like you. Hey, Chamaco... Perez seems suspicious. So what? He won't be suspicious for long. No. Count me out. It's too dangerous. Then be careful. It's quite simple: if you're not with me, you're against me. I won't repeat it. Understood? Aren't you cold? No. - You must be hungry, then? - No. You know... you have no reason to be afraid of me. You are so beautiful. I'm not like them. On one side: Perez, on the other: Chamaco. I don't know what to do. It's as if they hold me prisoner. They shouldn't treat me like this! Yes, I understand. Anyway, I've nothing to win. If you would... my father would reward you well. I know. But I'm not after the money. My father is a generous man. He will greatly appreciate your courage. If you help me escape, you could enlist in the army. And the others won't be able to hurt you. I'm not afraid of the others and money means nothing to me. Then, what do you want? You. Three well-armed battalions, that's quite something! What are you talking about? The government wants to do away with Guzman. 2000 men are marching on Lucedad. They even have cannons. - Cannons... - So what? That's not the first time. Remember... We've been through that already. And we weren't as many as today. I know, but... cannons, it's the first time. Let them come with their cannons! We've got the President's daughter! They won't dare. - We'll see if they won't dare. I know them. Three battalions, right? - Yes. This time, it's the end. We're totally crazy! We should have let the girl go. - What's with him? - Just ignore him. - Anyway, now it's too late. - Too late for what!? We just have to free the girl to cash the ransom and save our heads. And Guzman's life. That's what we have to do! Listen! The horses! You bastard! - Don't! You could hurt the girl! - We're not gonna leave that... Leave it! Diego... If we go by the mountain... is there a short cut for San Felipe? Yes, the gorges of Milagro. You'll be there before them. By horse, they'll have to follow the railway. Tonight, we'll stop by my mother's place at San Felipe. And tomorrow, you'll be free. - Thank you. - I hope you won't forget your promise. - Of course, but we're not safe yet. Let's hurry up! - Yes. We'll go down this way, it's shorter. I warn you... next time, I'll kill you! The little bastard was about to shoot you, I had to kill him! You! Saving my life once more? We'll settle that later. - Tell me we're not burying him! - I would bury even you! And you haven't the worth of a dog! If you know a prayer, say it. I don't know any. Are you Bertha Domingez? - Yes, why? Your son... - Oh, you're a friend of Chico? - Yes. Do you have news from him? Has he sent you? Do you think he's coming back home soon? Just tell me nothing happened to him. Is he hurt? He's... Your son was brave. Wait, I'll have a look. It's one of our men... Come on, hands up! The rifle. Now, turn around. Go ahead. It was bound to happen. She didn't lose any time. I should have been more careful. She won't let us go, now. - Are you afraid? Of course, I'm afraid, I'm no hero. If you had listened to me, this would all have been over for a long time and we would both be loaded. So, what do we do? How far can we go like this? You're the one who knows everything, so prove it, now! You're the chief, after all. A chief frightened by a girl! Keep your mouth shut! I've been keeping my mouth shut for too long! We have to try something, she won't dare to shoot. But you won't risk your life, you value it too much! I know why you don't try anything. She'll have no time to shoot twice. She can kill only one of us, that's what you think. The first one that'll turn over. And you want that one to be me. Like this, you'll have her for yourself alone. I'm not that dumb. I don't want to end up like this guy. See what I told you? She shouldn't have missed me. Because I won't miss her! Your Madonna! Emiliano... Who are you? A friend of Guzman. Then leave right away, don't stay here. What happened? They arrived at dawn. Over 2000 men. - And Guzman? - He had to move further with his men. Without fighting? He was hoping to save the city. Did you see? Where is Guzman now? We believe he's trying to reach the Sierra. - The Sierra... - Yes. Do you know La Cruz? I was born there. I even have a sister still living there. Farewell. - May God be with you. Are you back for good? He's with a young lady. A young lady? - She's an hostage. - Where is she? He locked her in the cellar. Can I see her? No. Isn't it great to see Perez, Isa? Come in, dinner's ready! - Who took her out? - Me. No, please stay. I'm the one in charge, here. That's no way to treat a woman. - And how do you think they treat women? I feel sorry for you and your men's stories! Did you forget they killed your husband? They did. Unfortunately for me. But one day, you'll have to stop all this. - After the victory. You'll never stop, neither side. It's a game nobody can win. What did I win with your cause? And the children? All the men are in the mountain or at the cemetery. And the women no longer have tears to cry. And did you see the fields? Only misery and pain grow there. And they don't win much on the other side. So you think your husband died for nothing? I wonder. Why was he fighting, after all? To make the kids and me happier. But are we happier now? - He wasn't only fighting for that! - Then for what, for the others? Absolutely, for the others! For you too. And for himself. For his dignity. His dignity... His it dignity that makes you fight a young lady? I told him all that but, after all, if my husband didn't go with the others, would I have loved him so much? It's their pride that leads them there. I know. Why are you worrying yourself because of that girl? She confused you, you look different. You didn't even kiss me. You look like you forgot we're getting married. Perez... Do you still love me a little? - Of course. - Then let her go. No. It's over. Guzman is dead. The revolution is crushed. Come. Let's go back to your sister's place. - We'll stop after victory. - You'll never stop, neither side. It's a game nobody can win. - We'll stop after victory. - You'll never stop, neither side. It's a game nobody can win. Here. There's a path behind the hill. Follow it straight ahead. You'll meet soldiers after a one hour ride. Farewell.
