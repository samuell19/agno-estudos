I CAN'T SEE WHY THEY BOTHERED. JOYCE JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO MARRY JIMMY. IN HER MIND, HE WAS A VERY GOOD CATCH. AND AFTER THE WEDDING JOYCE CONTINUED TO CONFIDE IN YOU ABOUT HER PROBLEMS? YEAH, SHE DID. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT SOME OF HER COMPLAINTS WERE? HE COMES AND GOES AS HE PLEASES. HIGH ALL THE TIME. HE WAS A HEAVY DRUG USER. THIS WAS A SORE POINT WITH JOYCE. WELL, NOT AT FIRST, BUT HE NEVER CAME AROUND AND THEN HE WOULD JUST LOSE IT. Nealon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN-- EXACTLY? WELL, HE WOULD... HE WOULD LIKE PULL A KNIFE ON HER AND CHASE HER AROUND THE ROOM. PUNCHED HER SO HARD ONCE, PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL. WHEN IS THE FIRST TIME JOYCE SAID SHE WANTED TO GET RID OF HER HUSBAND? UH... I REMEMBER A TIME... I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE FIRST TIME. WHEN THIS IS ALL BLONDE, IT'S GOING TO BE GORGEOUS. THAT WOULD BE NICE. CYNTHIA, I'LL DO HER. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY OFF YOUR FEET. I KNOW MY LIMIT. I DON'T WANT YOU POPPING YOUR TOAST WHEN WE GOT A STORE FULL OF CUSTOMERS. WHERE THE HELL IS COOKIE? Joyce: COOKIE, I'LL BRAIN YOU. I SWEAR, I WAS STUCK IN THE TUNNEL FOR AN HOUR. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT, DID YOU SWALLOW A HAND GRENADE? JOYCE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR MOTHER. HEY, JOYCE, TAKE THE BABY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WATCH HIM. I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING. YOU SHOOTING HOOPS? MAYBE THAT'S WHY I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING. WHAT IS THIS? WE RAN OUT OF PAMPERS. WHAT, ARE YOU CRIPPLED? GO BUY SOME. NO, IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING? I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT? OH, GREAT, JOYCE. CYNTHIA, COULD YOU HOLD HIM? REALLY FUCKING SMART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS YOUR SECOND APPOINTMENT. WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF ALL THESE CUSTOMERS? FUCK THESE CUSTOMERS. WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THEM?

YOU WANT HALF THE BUSINESS? JUST KILL HIM FOR ME. Cynthia: SHE SAID, "YOU WANT HALF THE BUSINESS, "JUST KILL HIM FOR ME." DID YOU TAKE THAT PROPOSITION SERIOUSLY? NO, I NEVER TOOK ANY OF THAT SERIOUSLY. BUT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME? WELL, IT WAS A JOKE, A RUNNING GAG. I MEAN, LEAVE THE OVEN ON WHILE HE'S SLEEPING. I MEAN, PUT AN APPLIANCE IN THE TUB WHILE HE'S TAKING A BATH BUT IT WAS JUST TALK. THEN I TOLD HER TO GO TO THE COPS. SHE SAID, "I GOT THE COPS AT MY HOUSE EVERY TIME HE BELTS ME, AND THEY DON'T DO SHIT. THEY TELL HIM TO COOL OFF." STILL, YOU ENCOURAGED HER TO DO SOMETHING. YEAH. IT'S ONLY NATURAL. YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH HER PREDICAMENT. YOU SEE ANOTHER WOMAN, A FRIEND, ABUSED YOU THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE, RIGHT? I TOLD HER TO DIVORCE HIM. THROW HIM OUT. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU HAVE A FRIEND, TWO FRIENDS, MARRIED WHO ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. YOU SEE HIM VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE HER. SHE SAYS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF THIS GUY AND YOU DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY? I WATCH THE HONEYMOONERS EVERY NIGHT. I DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. ONE OF THESE DAYS, CYNTHIA, POW, RIGHT TO THE MOON. I'M GOING TO GET SOME WATER, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU NEED THE TOILET? NO, THANKS. ALL RIGHT, SO... James: EVERY FUCKING WEEK I'VE GOT TO GO...

YOU'RE A REAL PAL, JOYCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AH. (Whistling) THERE. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM HIS SUGAR? I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE HIM THAT. YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM THE SUGAR? YOU GIVE HIM THE SUGAR. Cynthia: NICE DOGGIES. YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM A SMOOCH? Jennifer: MOMMY, THIS LOOKS LIKE BUTTERCUP. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT DOES. OKAY, SO NOW WE WAIT. YOU DIDN'T DO IT. YES, I DID. WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS? UH-UH. COME SIT WITH YOUR LITTLE BROTHER. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. (Baby crying) (knock at door) HEY THERE, CYN. WHAT'S UP? WANT SOME TEA? WE'VE GOT TO TALK HERE. WHAT, DID JOYCE SEND YOU UP HERE? NO. YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER. IT'S NOT GOOD HOW YOU FLY OFF THE HANDLE... I DON'T FLY OFF THE HANDLE FOR NO GOOD REASON. YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO TALK, NOT YELL. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE INTIMIDATING EVERYBODY. YOU USED TO BE SO HAPPY-GO-LUCKY. I'M HAPPY-GO-LU... I'M VERY HAPPY-GO-LUCKY. I DON'T INTIMIDATE YOU, DO I? WELL, JAMES, YOU CAN BE A LITTLE OVERBEARING. CYNTHIA, YOU SEE? HERE'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU. I CAN TALK TO YOU. I CANNOT TALK TO JOYCE. I CAN TALK TO JOYCE. THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE IN BAYONNE THAT CAN TALK TO HER. GOT ENOUGH SUGAR? ARE YOU GOING TO START WITH ME ABOUT THE SUGAR NOW TOO? I LIKE TEA, OKAY? I LIKE COFFEE. I CAN'T TAKE IT WITHOUT SUGAR. SHE KNOWS THIS. WE BEEN MARRIED FIVE YEARS. YOU THINK SHE COULD FIGURE THIS OUT? HOW HARD IS IT FOR ME TO GET SOME SUGAR? ONCE A WEEK, YOU LOOK IN THE CABINET. YOU GO, "UH-OH, WE NEED SUGAR." YOU TAKE A PENCIL, A PIECE OF PAPER. S-U-G-E-R, THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. YOU GO TO THE STORE, YOU SAY, "WHAT DO I NEED-- A ONE-POUND BOX, THAT BIG FIVE-POUND SACK?" WHATEVER YOU NEED. YOU BRING THE SUGAR HOME. BUT CAN I GET SOME SUGAR? NO, BUT WE CAN HAVE THIS ARGUMENT. FIVE MINUTES LATER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M YELLING ABOUT. YOU WEARING A BRA TODAY? (Phone rings) WHAT? Is Cynthia there? WE'RE TALKING HERE. Did you get the sugar? YES, THANK YOU, AND FUCK YOU. OH, SHIT! OH, CYNTHIA. WE HAD AN ACCIDENT. CYNTHIA SPILLED THE TEA. HOLD ON, LET ME GET THE DUSTBUSTER. LOOK OUT. WAIT. YOU'VE GOT SOME SUGAR ON YOU. JIMMY. LET ME SEE YOUR TITS. I'M NOT LETTING YOU LOOK AT MY TITS. JOYCE IS DOWNSTAIRS. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY NOTHING. SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND. ISN'T THAT WHAT BEST FRIENDS ARE FOR? I'VE GOT TO GO. ALL RIGHT. LET ME GET THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR. SHOW ME YOUR TITTIES. OPEN THE DOOR. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO-- SCREAM? I'LL DO IT FOR YOU. HELP, JOYCE. JIMMY WANTS ME TO SHOW HIM MY TITTIES BUT I DON'T WANT TO. I GOT CUSTOMERS DOWNSTAIRS. LET ME JUST SEE YOUR TITS. WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS DOING THIS TO ME? BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THERE. DON'T DO THIS. WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? FUCKING MOOCH! GO AHEAD. RUN DOWN THERE AND TELL HER WHAT I DID. I DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER OF YOUR FACES UP HERE AGAIN OR I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. Cynthia: I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD DO IT. JAMES WOULD BE DEAD IF YOU DIDN'T STOP IT. I THOUGHT IF I HADN'T STOPPED IT SHE WOULD HAVE. IT WAS A SICK GAME. WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT THE SUGAR? UM... SHE SAID, "YOU DROPPED THE SUGAR ON THE FLOOR?" I SAID, "OF COURSE. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?" AND SHE SAID, "YOU SEE?" MEANING? MEANING "WE COULD HAVE GOT RID OF HIM AND YOU DIDN'T." DID YOU HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID? YOU SAID "WE." "WE COULD HAVE GOT RID OF HIM." NO, I DIDN'T. YOU DID. NO, I DIDN'T. I CAN PLAY IT BACK. WELL, SO. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. EVERYTHING MEANS SOMETHING, CYNTHIA. IT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING-- WHAT YOU WANT. ALL I WANT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME. THAT'S ALL. WHEN YOU LEFT THE SHOP WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE? Arthur: I DON'T WANT TO GO. YOU SURE? I CAN GET A SITTER. DON'T PUT YOUR FIRE ENGINE ON DADDY'S HARD WORK. I'LL TELL SANTA NOT TO COME. LET'S GO WATCH FRAGGLES. DADDY WILL LET YOU STAY UP A LITTLE LATER. DON'T THREATEN HER, ARTHUR. SHE'LL RESENT YOU. SHE RESENTS HER MOTHER LEAVING HER ALONE. DON'T PUT YOUR FEELINGS ON HER. YOU CAN COME OUT. I'M WORKING. I'VE GOT TO GET A NEW PITCH READY. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT. YOU SAID YOU WOULD GO OVER IT. I'LL GO OVER IT TOMORROW. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE PEOPLE. LET'S NOT INSULT EACH OTHER'S FRIENDS. THE GUY HANGS OUT IN THE PLAYGROUND. YOUR FRIENDS WOULD SCREW YOU IN A MINUTE. (Horn honks) THERE'S A HUNGRY MAN IN THE FREEZER. THE BOTTLE'S IN THE FRIDGE. HEAT IT UP. WOULD YOU TAKE OUT THE DOG? YEAH, YEAH. OKAY. WATCH YOUR BROTHER. IF HE STARTS DRINKING YOU TAKE A CAB HOME. HE'S NOT GOING. GET YOUR BROTHER. HE'S GOING UP THE STAIRS. HI. HEY. THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. (Imitating Woody Woodpecker) GUESS WHO? CYNTHIA, WHAT'S UP?

I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYTHING THEY COULD TRACE. BUT YOU LEFT THE BODY. I TOLD YOU I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT. Nealon: WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT? I THINK WE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. Joyce: IT IS TOO LATE. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. WE CAN STILL CALL THE POLICE. NO WE CAN'T. YES, WE CAN, JOYCE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE NOTHING. YOU GOT TO LISTEN BECAUSE WE ARE IN DEEP SHIT. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW? WE'RE GOING TO SAY WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER. THAT WAY WE DON'T MIX OUR STORIES UP. YOU TELL ARTHUR THAT ME AND JIMMY HAD A FIGHT. YOU DECIDED YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO. YOU GET THE VAN CLEANED UP IN THE MORNING. WHY ME? BECAUSE I GOT TO BE HERE. I GOT TO REPORT HIM MISSING TO THE COPS IN THE MORNING. YOU TAKE HIS WALLET AND HIS JEWELRY FOR ME. GET RID OF IT. I CAN'T DO THAT. WHY NOT? I'M JUST NOT READY FOR THAT. I CAN'T DO IT.

CYNTHIA, PLEASE DON'T WORRY. I GOT TO GO. I GOT TO GET HOME. JOYCE CALLED HER MOTHER-IN-LAW AND STARTED THE STORY ABOUT JIMMY DISAPPEARING AT THE CARNIVAL. GLORIA JUST HUNG UP ON HER. JOYCE SAID, "HE'S DEAD AND WHAT THE FUCK DOES SHE CARE?" I JUST WALKED HOME. Arthur: CYNTHIA? CYNTHIA? YEAH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING. GO BACK TO BED. YOU GOT TO TAKE OUT BUTTERCUP. I FORGOT TO TAKE HER OUT. YEAH. OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? CYNTHIA? WHAT? HEY. HEY, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG, HUH? WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT? JOYCE KILLED JIMMY. JOYCE KILLED JIMMY? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING... CYNTHIA. MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. THEY... THEY WERE FIGHTING AND HE TRIED TO CHOKE HER SO SHE STABBED HIM WITH A RAZOR. SHE... WHAT DO YOU..? HOW DO YOU STAB SOMEONE WITH A RAZOR? I DON'T KNOW. A SLICE. YOU KNOW. A CUT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY. THEY WERE FIGHTING ALL NIGHT. HE WAS FUCKED UP. I LEFT HIM IN THE VAN, SLEEPING. DID YOU SEE HER? NO. I DIDN'T SEE HER. AFTER. AFTER, I SAW HER. HE WAS CUT UP BAD. THAT DON'T MEAN HE'S DEAD. JESUS CHRIST, ARTHUR. I HAVE BLOOD ALL OVER ME. I HELPED HER GET RID OF THE BODY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

THEY'RE ANIMALS. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WITH THEM. WE GOT TO CALL SOMEBODY. AND SAY WHAT? SAY WHAT? SAY WHAT HAPPENED... WHATEVER HAPPENED, AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. YOU'RE PRETTY INNOCENT, RIGHT? CYNTHIA, YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING, RIGHT? FOR CHRIST'S SAKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME YOU COULD SAY THAT? YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE POLICE? I'LL CALL THE POLICE. WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION GOING TO BE? I DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLANATION. YOU GET ME TO DO WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN YOU DON'T WANT ME TO DO IT. WHY IS IT YOU START THINGS AT ALL THE WRONG TIMES? I'M BUSTING MY FUCKING ASS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE. WHO THE HELL IS GOING TO BUY ANYTHING FROM A KILLER'S WIFE... HUSBAND'S WIFE... WHATEVER THE FUCK WE ARE? WHY DO I TELL YOU ANYTHING? SHIT. SHE ACTUALLY KILLED HIM? SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? IT'S HER PROBLEM. I'M OUT OF IT. SHE SWORE SHE WOULDN'T INVOLVE ME. SHE SAID THAT? SHE SWORE UP AND DOWN. SO IF SOMEBODY'S GOT TO CALL THE POLICE LET HER BE THE ONE. LOOK AT YOU. TAKE THIS OFF, HUH? MY GOD. IF ANYBODY SAW YOU, CYNTHIA... COME ON. COME ON. LOOK AT THIS BLOOD. IT'S GOING TO NEVER, NEVER, NEVER COME OFF. IT'S ALL RIGHT. CHRIST ALMIGHTY. LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO CUT IT OFF. YOU HAVE TO NOT SEE HER. WHERE'S THE JOY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE DETERGENT. THE SOAP. YOU MEAN CHEER. JOY. CHEER. DECK THE FUCKING HALLS WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY, CYNTHIA. UNDER THE SINK. AND NOBODY SAW YOU? NOBODY SAW US AND SHE WON'T TELL ANYBODY I WAS WITH HER. THIS BETTER BE THE END OF IT. THE KIDS WILL LOSE THEIR MOTHER. I'LL LOSE A FUCKING JOB AND THEN WE'LL BE ON THE STREETS. ON THE FUCKING STREETS. DID YOUR HUSBAND PERSIST ABOUT CALLING THE POLICE? HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED EITHER. WE WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY KIDS. I DON'T KNOW. SOME THINGS... I DON'T KNOW. DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD GET AWAY WITH THIS? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I MAY HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT JAMES BUT I WOULD NEVER RAISE A HAND TO ANYONE. I WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE! NOW LOOK, IF JOYCE WAS GOING TO GET CAUGHT THEN SHE WAS GOING TO GET CAUGHT. I AM NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE TO TURN ON HER. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU NODDING FOR? NOW WAIT A MINUTE. YOU HAVE A SO-CALLED FRIEND WHO BRUTALLY MURDERS HER HUSBAND, ORPHANS HIS KID AND DROPS HIS BODY OFF, AND YOU'RE PROTECTING HER? COPS DON'T PROTECT EACH OTHER? THAT'S FUCKING NEWS!

Man: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR? Joyce: YEAH. I AM HER ATTORNEY. I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY CLIENT. SO, DO YOU DO YOUR OWN HAIR? IT'S NICE HOW YOU SWEEP IT UP IN THE BACK THERE. YEAH, I DO. Nealon: CYNTHIA, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY. YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND AND SWORE TO AVOID CONTACT WITH JOYCE? Cynthia: YES. Woods: HOW LONG DID THAT LAST? (Ringing) HELLO?

HOW DO I TELL MY SON HIS FATHER'S IN HEAVEN? I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN, DOMINIC? WHAT, I GOT TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU? JUST WAIT AND SEE. DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. JOEY?

CYNTHIA, YOU NEED THE KEYS TO THE VAN, RIGHT? COME HERE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PICK UP ALL THOSE WIGS AND HAIR PIECES WE ORDERED. THEY'RE PROBABLY READY BY NOW. WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

I'LL GO WITH YOU. JOEY, I NEED YOU HERE WITH ME. JOEY, JUST RELAX AND SIT. I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD. I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM. Aunt Rita: WE SHOULD GO IN THE VAN. Joyce: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

STOP! CYNTHIA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SHIT! Nealon: SO JOYCE KEEPS HER END OF THE BARGAIN-- YOU WERE HOME. YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE CARNIVAL. YEAH. AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE VAN? I PARKED IT DOWN THE BLOCK FROM ME. YOU HELPED GET RID OF THE EVIDENCE? I THOUGHT, "I'M OUT OF IT. "IF I CAN JUST GET ME THROUGH THIS NOBODY WILL EVEN KNOW I WAS THERE." WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY HEAR ANYTHING? SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW DAMN WELL. I'M NOT LYING FOR ANYBODY. ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT THE VAN. JOYCE TOLD ME WHAT TO SAY-- THAT SOMEBODY BROKE INTO IT AND CLEANED IT OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I'M NOT LYING FOR ANYBODY. WHY? WHY WHAT? JUST SAY SOMEBODY BROKE INTO THE TRUCK. WE BOTH UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DON'T WE? I THINK SO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JOSEPH? YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M DOING, BABE. HEY, WHERE'S ALL THE WIGS? THEY WEREN'T READY. SO? HOW COME THIS VAN IS SO CLEAN? IT'S USUALLY A PIGSTY. WHAT? YOU GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE? THE WAY YOU DROVE OUT OF HERE THIS MORNING... JOEY, YOU'RE CRAZY. (Baby crying) YEAH, WE'LL SEE HOW CRAZY I AM. WE'LL SEE HOW CRAZY THE POLICE THINK I AM. WHAT SHOULD I TELL JOYCE? SHE CAN BURN IN HELL, THAT'S WHAT. OH, THAT'S REAL NICE TALK TO YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE. Nealon: DID YOU SEE JOYCE AGAIN THAT DAY? Cynthia: I DIDN'T SEE HER UNTIL THE NEXT DAY-- AT POLASKI'S. THAT'S A FUNERAL PARLOR WHERE JAMES WAS LAID OUT. (Sobbing) Gloria: I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN. LOOK AT HIM. HE'S ALL ALONE UP THERE. OH, GOD. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. HE'S THE FIRST TO GO. SHE MAKES ME SICK. ALWAYS THE ACTRESS. I'M THE WIFE. I'M THE ONE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME TO. JUST KEEP YOUR DIGNITY. LET THEM BE THE PHONIES THEY ARE. JOEY... THANKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING SITTING BACK HERE? THEY GOT HERE FIRST AND TOOK ALL THE FRONT SEATS. Gloria: HE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL-- EXCEPT THAT BEARD. Maria: THE BEARD IS GOOD-- IT HIDES THE SCAR. DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HIM. WE GOT TO TALK. EXCUSE ME, MOM. GO AHEAD. LOCK THE DOOR. THE COPS KEPT THE VAN. OH, SHIT. FUCKING JOEY AND HIS SUSPICIOUS MIND. DID YOU CLEAN IT GOOD? I SPENT TWO FUCKING HOURS. THERE'S NO BLOOD? IT'S SPOTLESS. BECAUSE COPS GOT EYES DOGS WITH NOSES THAT SMELL EVERYTHING AND SCIENCE-- MR. FUCKING WIZARD! JOYCE, PLEASE, YOU GOT TO CALM DOWN. I TOLD THE COPS SOMEBODY BROKE INTO THE VAN STOLE ALL THE SHIT, AND THEN WASHED IT OUT TO COVER UP THE FINGERPRINTS. THIS WAY, THEY DON'T THINK WE CLEANED IT. (Knocking) Woman: ANYBODY IN THERE? COME BACK LATER. IT'S CROWDED IN HERE ALREADY. WHAT, EVERYBODY HAS TO GO AT THE SAME TIME? AND FUCKING COOKIE TOO. DID YOU TALK TO HER? NO. SHE DIDN'T EVEN COME. WHEN HER BROTHER KILLED HIMSELF AND DIED I WAS A FRIEND TO HER. WELL, JIMMY DID SELL HIM THAT BAD ACID. BAD ACID, MY ASS! PEOPLE HAVE TO GET THEIR STORIES STRAIGHT. HER BROTHER WAS ALWAYS DISTURBED. IF SHE OPENS HER MOUTH, WE'LL GET CAUGHT. JOYCE, NO ONE'S GETTING CAUGHT. YOU HAVE TO BE OPTIMISTIC. GRIEVING, BUT OPTIMISTIC. WHY, DO I LOOK GUILTY? NO, YOU DON'T. YOU LOOK MOURNFUL. YOU LOOK HOW YOU SHOULD LOOK. MOURNFUL. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR MIND SO LET'S NOT TELL THEM. KEEP REMINDING ME, BECAUSE I'M A SUCKY LIAR. YOU'RE A TERRIFIC LIAR. YOU'VE JUST LOST CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF. WELL, THERE'S CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF NOW. WE GOT TO GET TO THE SHOP. YOU TAKE HIS WALLET AND JEWELRY. I TOLD YOU TO GET RID OF THAT SHIT! AW, JESUS! SHE WAS DUMPING OUT ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT COOKIE. I HAD DONE ENOUGH ALREADY. SO YOU REFUSED TO HELP HER? WELL, JOYCE CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER. WHAT THE HELL'S IN THIS? HIS WALLET, HIS JEWELRY, AND HIS GUN. OH, JOYCE, ENOUGH ALREADY. I CAN'T HAVE ANY GUNS. IT'S NOT EVEN REGISTERED. HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN IT? I GOT TO GET IT OUT OF HERE. YOU COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER. SHE WAS TAKING PILLS LEFT AND RIGHT. SHE WAS CRACKING UP. I THINK I HEAR HIM. LIKE, SOMETIMES I THINK I HEAR HIS VOICE CALLING ME-- "JOYCIE." IT'S REALLY WEIRD THE WAY THE MIND WORKS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE. AFTER THE FUNERAL, YOU SHOULD TAKE A TRIP. GET AWAY FOR A WHILE. PUT THIS ALL BEHIND YOU. IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN'T KEEP PUTTING ME IN THE MIDDLE HERE. I GOT TO KEEP IT QUIET WITH ARTIE. SO IF WE DON'T TALK FOR A WHILE IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST, ALL RIGHT? JOYCE? WHAT? IT'S ALL RIGHT IF WE DON'T TALK? YOU KNOW, I AM SO EXHAUSTED AND I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THEY HAVE CONCERNS-- YOU HAVE ANSWERS. THEY HAVE OBJECTIONS-- YOU USE IT AS BUYING SIGNALS. YOU MAKE THE DEAL. YOU CLOSE THE DEAL. YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO THINK. YOU WOO THEM. YOU SELL THEM AND SIGN THEM. CAVEAT EMPTOR. END OF STORY. Arthur: CYNTHIA? YEAH, ONLY ME. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. A PERSON USUALLY SAYS, "I'M HOME," OR SOMETHING. WELL, I'M HOME. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? NOTHING. WHY? WHY? WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WAKE? DID YOU TALK TO HER? YEAH, I TALKED TO HER AND I TOLD HER NOT TO CALL ANYMORE AND THAT I'M OUT OF IT. SID IS HERE. OH, GREAT. I'LL GO SAY HELLO. (Babies crying) HI, BABIES. COME HERE, SWEETIE. HI, SIDNEY. HOW ARE YOU? THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU? ARTIE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. Cynthia: HE DID? YEAH, I TOLD HIM ABOUT JAMES-- ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? SOMEBODY STOLE SOMETHING AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD AND HE DIED. FUCKING ANIMALS. UH, YOU'LL EXCUSE MY FRENCH. THEY SHOULD LINE THEM ALL UP, SLICE THEM OPEN AND SPREAD THEIR GUTS OUT. IT'S AN UGLY PICTURE, I KNOW, BUT... A YOUNG COUPLE, RIGHT? DID THEY RENT OR OWN? Arthur: UH, THEY, UH... THEY RENTED. OOH! BANG! UH, COME ON, HONEY. LET'S GET READY FOR BED. HEY, HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BAG? NOTHING. IT'S JUST MY TAMPAX. I'M GOING TO GET THE KIDS READY FOR BED. COME ON, HONEY. GOOD NIGHT, SIDNEY. GOOD NIGHT. FREAKIN' ANIMALS-- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. I KNOW. KAVEET EMPTOR. CAVEAT EMPTOR. YEAH, RIGHT. OKAY. SO, SHE'S TAKEN TO WOMEN'S DETENTION. Cynthia: SHE SENT WORD THROUGH HER FATHER THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE ME, AND HE, UH... TOLD ME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT SHE HAD WITH HER WRISTS. HEY, JOYCE. HEY. UH... (coughing) JOYCE, WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOURSELF? I DON'T KNOW, MAN. SOMEBODY'S TALKING. SO, WHAT? SOMEBODY'S TALKING. THEY ASK QUESTIONS LIKE SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING. WELL, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THEM. NOT EVEN COOKIE? NO. YOU KNOW COOKIE. SHE'S OFF DYEING HER HAIR GREEN, HANGING OUT IN NEWARK SCARED OF HER OWN SHADOW. IF SHE TALKS, THEY'LL PUT YOU IN THE NEXT CELL. WHAT DO YOU WANT? KNOCK HER OVER THE HEAD... (coughing) ...WITH A FUCKING CLUB, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. THAT WILL SHUT HER UP. JOYCE, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. YOU'VE GOT TO STAY STRONG. YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING OR WE'LL KISS OUR KIDS GOOD-BYE. (Coughing) Nealon: ALL RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT GETTING YOUR STORIES TOGETHER ON THE VAN? SO, LIKE I WAS TELLING MISTER, UH... KOLHATKAR. YOU HAD THE VAN ON, UH... MONDAY TUESDAY AND, UH... WEDNESDAY, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND THEN IT GOT BROKEN INTO ON... THURSDAY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THURSDAY. THURSDAY. YEAH. AND HOW DID YOU HOPE TO VERIFY THIS? WE KEEP A LOG OF EVERYTHING AT THE SHOP. THIS IS MY NUMBER. CAN I PICK IT UP TONIGHT? I WOULD RATHER GET IT TO YOU TOMORROW. AS YOU WISH. I WILL WAIT TILL I HEAR FROM YOU. DON'T WORRY. Nealon: DID YOU DELIVER THE LOG BOOK? NO. I HAD TO GO TO WOOLWORTH'S AND GET THE BOOKS. I HAD TO CHECK FOR CONFLICTS. THIS WAS A MUCH BIGGER JOB THAN I EXPECTED. I HAVE TO STOP HERE. SOMETHING KEEPS BOTHERING ME. DID YOU TELL YOUR HUSBAND YOU WENT TO VISIT JOYCE? NO. OR ABOUT THE LOG BOOK AND CLEANING THE VAN? NO. YOU SEE? YOU SAID YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND EVERYTHING ON THE NIGHT JAMES WAS MURDERED. BUT NOW SOMETHING ELSE IS HAPPENING. NOW YOU DON'T BRING HIM UP TO DATE ANYMORE. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT? I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET HIM. I MEAN, I THOUGHT I COULD DEAL WITH THIS. NO, NO. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE. JOYCE SUSPECTS SOMEONE IS TALKING. YEAH, SHE'S BEING PARANOID. SHE SUSPECTS SOMEONE IS TALKING. MAYBE COOKIE. BUT SOMEBODY KNEW. WHO KNEW? YOU SEE, YOU'RE REALLY CONFUSING ME NOW. CYNTHIA, PLEASE. YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT GIRL. IT NEVER CROSSES YOUR MIND THAT IT MIGHT BE ARTHUR WHO'S TALKING? ARTHUR KNEW. YOU TOLD ARTHUR. NEVER! ALL RIGHT? HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT. HIS CONCERN WAS FOR ME AND THE KIDS. HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE ME. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT TRUSTING HIM ANYMORE. I JUST WANTED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF IT-- KEEP THE PEACE-- UNTIL THAT FUCKING LAWYER CALLED. CYNTHIA, TELL US ABOUT THAT. IT WAS LATE. I WAS WASHING THE DISHES. THE KIDS WERE ASLEEP. I... I DIDN'T HEAR THE PHONE RING. ARTHUR CAME UP BEHIND ME. YOU GOT A CALL TODAY FROM YOUR FRIEND'S LAWYER. HE SAID, "YOU GOT A CALL TODAY FROM YOUR FRIEND'S LAWYER." HE WANTS THAT BOOK YOU PROMISED HIM. WHAT IS THIS? I TOLD HIM TO GIVE IT TO ME. IT DIDN'T CONCERN HIM. HE SAID, "BUT THIS IS A LIE." IT'S FOR JOYCE'S DEFENSE. WHY ARE YOU STILL INVOLVED IN THIS? IT'S TO SHOW THE VAN WAS ROBBED. LISTEN TO ME, CYNTHIA. IF YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR NOSE UP HER BEHIND YOU SHOULD JUST PACK YOUR BAGS AND GO WITH HER. Woods: SO YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS NOW. YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER THIS THING. WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT. HE'S THREATENING YOU. NO, NO. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT JOYCE. HE WAS MORE UPSET WITH HER THAN HE WAS WITH ME. SHE REALLY NEEDED HELP-- PROFESSIONAL HELP. Woods: AND DID SHE GET HELP? NO, SHE GOT BAIL. Jennifer: HEY. ARE YOU WRAPPING HIM UP LIKE A PRESENT? (Knocking) I'M GOING TO GET THE DOOR. JOYCE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? ARTHUR'S GOING TO BE HOME ANY MINUTE. I NEED THE GUN AND THE JEWELRY. WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M AFRAID OF MY IN-LAWS. THEY'RE AFTER ME. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GET OUT OF TOWN. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN IN YOUR FRAME OF MIND. NOBODY'S FOLLOWING YOUR ASS ALL OVER TOWN. YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR. BUT IF I GO, SO HELP ME, EVERYBODY'S GOING. JUST GIVE ME WHAT I CAME FOR. THIS IS HOW WE'LL GET CAUGHT-- WHEN WE TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER. I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT PROTECTION SO JUST DO THIS FOR ME, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. (Baby gurgling) Jennifer: HEY!.. HEY, HEY. Baby: HEY... DAA! Jennifer: DADDY! HEY, HOW'S MY LITTLE GIRL? COME TO DADDY. DADDY! OH, JOYCE! I THOUGHT YOU WAS GRETA GARBO THERE FOR A MINUTE. ARTHUR. GO WATCH YOUR BROTHER, HUH, HONEY? HOW'S IT GOING? THE INVESTIGATION AND EVERYTHING? THOSE POLICE-- THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT. THEY HAVE NO SUSPECTS? WHO KNOWS? THEY DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING. BUT YOU THINK HE WAS ROBBED. THAT'S WHAT I FIGURE. DIDN'T THEY ARREST YOU OR SOMETHING? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW STUPID THEY ARE. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A CASE. IT'S FALLING APART. Joyce: THEY SHOULD FIND OUT WHO REALLY DID IT. WE'D ALL BE BETTER OFF. Arthur: IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM? WHO HAD A GRUDGE OR SOMETHING? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: MOST MURDERS ARE COMMITTED BY SOMEONE YOU KNOW. FAMILY, EVEN. OH, YEAH? YEAH. WELL, IF YOU GOT ANY HUNCHES, I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBER. YOU CAN CALL THE DETECTIVE YOURSELF. WELL, I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT. UH, HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR ANTHONY. THANKS. SO, YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT? Joyce: ARTHUR, NICE SEEING YOU. BE WELL. HEY, JOYCE, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO WORK OUT. YOU WAIT AND SEE. I'M JUST GOING TO WALK HER OUT. THAT FUCK THINKS HE KNOWS SOMETHING. DID YOU SAY ANYTHING? HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. YOU SEE THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME? HE'S NEVER LIKED YOU, SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? A LITTLE SYMPATHY. I AM THE FUCKING WIDOW, YOU KNOW. SO, DO YOU WANT A MEDAL? YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM BECAUSE HE'D OPEN HIS MOUTH. HE WON'T OPEN HIS MOUTH. WHAT? WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM? I WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. YOU THINK I TOLD HIM I GOT MY PERIOD? GEEZ! THE MAN IS A THREAT. WE CAN'T AFFORD HIM SAYING SOMETHING. I'D GET HIM FIRST SO HELP ME GOD..! JOYCE, YOU'RE LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. YOU BETTER NOT BE SCREWING ME OVER 'CAUSE SO HELP ME, I'LL GET YOUR HUSBAND I'LL GET YOUR CHILDREN, AND I WILL FUCKING GET YOU! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. I'M TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT! IT'S FUCKING OVER! YOU THINK IT'S OVER? YOU GOT IT, BABY. GOOD BOY. HAVE A COOKIE. GOOD BOY. (Door opens and closes) HI, SWEET BOY. COME HERE. WHERE'S JENNIFER? SHE'S UPSTAIRS. SO WHAT ARE YOU TWO CHATTING ABOUT, HUH? NOTHING. JUST TALKING. SHE THINKS SHE'S GETTING AWAY WITH IT. SHE'S NOT EVEN WORRIED. I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT HER NEAR THIS HOUSE OR NEAR THE KIDS. ART, WHAT DO YOU THINK, I INVITED HER? WHO YOU CALLING? I'M CALLING THE POLICE. ARTHUR, HANG UP THE PHONE. WE BEEN THROUGH THIS LONG ENOUGH. I'M ENDING IT HERE AND NOW. LET'S NOT BE STUPID. THAT WOMAN'S A FUCKING MANIAC. YOU DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH HER! WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS? HUH? THINK ABOUT IT. YEAH, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT ALL RIGHT. HERE, COME ON. LET'S GO IN THE BEDROOM. WATCH YOUR LITTLE BROTHER. MOMMY'S GOT TO TALK TO DADDY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING TO GO SEE A LAWYER ABOUT A DIVORCE AND A SEPARATION. I'M SICK OF YOU FAVORING HER OVER ME. YOU ALWAYS DID. ALL THESE YEARS, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED TO ME. YOU TWO HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO EACH OTHER. WELL, NOW YOU CAN HAVE HER WITH MY BLESSINGS. THIS IS THE REAL BALLSY THING TO DO-- THROW ME OUT WITH THE KIDS WHEN WE NEED YOU THE MOST. NO, YOU GOT IT WRONG. YOU GO. THE KIDS STAY WITH ME. YOU'RE NOT FIT TO BE THEIR MOTHER. AND YOU RAISE ONE FINGER TO STOP ME AND I WILL BURN YOU AND YOUR FRIEND TOGETHER. YOU GOT THAT? Woods: SOUNDS LIKE JAMES AND JOYCE OVER THERE. NEVER LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES. WHY DON'T YOU HELP US OUT HERE 'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. HE JUST WAS VERY FRUSTRATED THAT I COULDN'T AVOID HER. BUT HE'S BLAMING YOU FOR THAT. JESUS! I TELL YOU ONE FIGHT, YOU MAKE IT MY WHOLE LIFE. HE JUST WAS TAKING HIS FRUSTRATIONS OUT ON ME. COUPLES SAY THINGS TO HURT EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT. THEN THEY MAKE UP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? OH, SO HE'S NOT BLAMING YOU, OR ATTACKING YOU. HE'S ACTUALLY COMING TO YOUR RESCUE. (Imitates bugle charge) I WOULDN'T MAKE FUN. BUT HE'S THROWING YOU OUT. AND YOU GOT JOYCE MAKING LIKE POCAHONTAS. YOU'RE REALLY CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. I MADE MY CHOICE. I TOLD MY HUSBAND MY PLACE WAS WITH HIM. I WASN'T GOING TO DESTROY MY MARRIAGE OVER THIS. THEN WHERE WOULD I BE? I THOUGHT IF THEY CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME THAT I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THE TRUTH, AND THAT'S IT. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT? NOBODY ASKED. NOBODY ASKED? NOT UNTIL, UH... THEY FOUND MY HUSBAND'S BODY. COULDN'T YOU HAVE PICKED UP A QUARTER AND CALLED SOMEBODY? (Clears throat) Nealon: OKAY, ON THE DAY YOUR HUSBAND WAS KILLED THE FIRST THING YOU DID THAT MORNING WAS WHAT? I KISSED MY HUSBAND GOOD-BYE. AFTER HE LEFT, I TOOK THE KIDS AND, UH... LEFT THE HOUSE. EVERY DAY I WOULD GO BY MY MOTHER'S, OR MY SISTER'S-- ANYPLACE TO AVOID JOYCE. (Girls giggling) (phone ringing) HELLO? Could I speak with Cynthia? WHO'S THIS? Uh, Joyce. HOLD ON. - CYN, TELEPHONE. - WHO IS IT? IT'S YOUR FRIEND. JOYCE. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. THIS BABY'S SOAKING WET. CYN, WHERE ARE THE DIAPERS? I... I DON'T KNOW, MA. LAUREN, GET MA ONE OF YOUR DIAPERS, OKAY? WATCH MY SAUCE. Yeah, I'm here. CYNTHIA, I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU-- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK? LISTEN, THINK WHATEVER YOU WANT. SO YOU GOING HOME, OR WHAT? No, I'm going to be here a while. IS ARTHUR WITH YOU? NO, HE'S HOME. I'M WITH THE KIDS. WHY? NOW THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU SAY SHE'S GOT IT IN FOR YOU, GOT IT IN FOR ARTHUR THEN YOU GIVE HER THIS INFORMATION THAT HE'S HOME ALONE AND YOU'RE WAY OVER AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE WHICH GIVES HER THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND DO WHATEVER IT IS SHE'D LIKE TO DO. WEREN'T YOU SUSPICIOUS OF HER QUESTIONS? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ARTHUR? YOU SPILLED YOUR GUTS TO ARTHUR AND NOW HE'S TRYING TO PULL SOMETHING. SHE'S CONCERNED AGAIN NOW THAT ARTHUR IS SETTING HER UP. I TOLD HER HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. ARTHUR'S HAD IT IN FOR ME FROM WAY BACK. THE PAST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I'm going over there and find out what was said. If I don't like what I hear, I'll set things straight. DON'T START WITH ARTIE. HE WON'T STAND FOR THIS SHIT. I'M NOT GOING TO START WITH ARTIE. I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH ARTIE. I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST THREATENING ME. Nealon: DID YOU THINK SHE WOULD JUST TALK TO HIM? GO OVER AND THREATEN HIM? I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT SHE WOULD DO. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. I'M JUST REALLY TIRED, THAT'S ALL. WELL, DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH, OKAY? OKAY. GIVE ME A KISS. - BYE, SWEETIE. - COME ON, BABY. Woods: HOW LONG DID YOU SLEEP FOR? COUPLE OF HOURS-- TILL MY FATHER CAME IN AND WOKE ME. THEN WHAT HAPPENS? CYNTHIA, HEY. COME ON, HONEY. OH... DAD, WHAT TIME IS IT? IT'S ALMOST 11:30. COME UPSTAIRS AND GET SOME SLEEP. DID, UM... ARTIE CALL? NO. WHY DON'T YOU GO GET SOME SLEEP? NO. I SHOULD GO ON HOME. YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE YOU? - YEAH. THE KIDS STILL ASLEEP? - YEAH, SURE, THEY'RE FINE. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO HOME? YEAH, I'M SURE. Wood: YOUR FATHER DRIVES YOU HOME. DO YOU EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS TO HIM? I TOLD HIM I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT ARTHUR DIDN'T CALL ME BACK. HE SAID I PROBABLY JUST SLEPT THROUGH THE CALL AND MAYBE ARTHUR FELL ASLEEP. I DON'T KNOW. Wood: BUT YOU KNEW BETTER. NO, I JUST KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP WHEN I SAW THE LIGHTS. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WATER? PLEASE. OKAY. THANK YOU. DO YOU FEEL ABLE TO CONTINUE? ALL RIGHT. LET ME SAY, CINDY, YOU KNOW I DO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT THIS ORDEAL HAS BEEN FOR YOU HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU TO STEP FORWARD AND MAKE THIS STATEMENT BUT SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T SIT RIGHT HERE. MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU. THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING-- MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME. NOW, ON THE DAY ARTHUR IS KILLED YOU WENT TO YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO BE SAFE. AND I WANTED TO SEE MY MOTHER. YES, YES, IT'S A GOOD TIME THE RIGHT TIME, TO VISIT YOUR MOTHER. JOYCE CALLS. HER FUSE IS STILL BURNING. SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO SHUT ARTHUR UP. I TOLD HER ARTHUR WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I TRUSTED HIM. HE WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING. YOU'RE PLEADING WITH HER TO SAVE HIS LIFE. I WAS DEFENDING HIM. AND THEN, AFTER EVERYTHING JOYCE HAS DONE-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF-- YOU GO TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH? WELL, I WAS DRINKING, AND NODDED OFF. THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WELL, EXPLAIN IT TO ME. THERE'S A KILLER ON A RAMPAGE THREATENING TO GET YOUR HUSBAND AND YOU NOD OFF? NOW YOU TELL ME IF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE. YOU TELL ME IF THAT MAKES SENSE. WELL, IT... DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE WENT HOME. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY. WHO DO YOU TELL? WHO DO YOU WARN? NO. THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON. YOU COME IN HERE, YOU TALK ABOUT JOYCE BUT YOU KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. YOU LET IT HAPPEN. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING OR GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE ASKING US TO ACCEPT TOO MUCH. IF JOYCE WASN'T A MURDERER IF JOYCE HADN'T SLAUGHTERED JAMES THEN I'D BE SAYING, "MAYBE. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T REALIZE." BUT WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU MAKE HER MORE ANGRY. YOU THREW IT IN HER FACE. YOU MADE HER FURIOUS. I'M NOT SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS 100 % TRUE. I'M NOT SURE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS 100 % TRUE. I THINK YOU WANTED HIM DEAD. THAT'S A GODDAMN LIE! YOU THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU UP AS JOYCE'S ACCOMPLICE, TAKE THE KIDS AND SHIP YOU OFF FOR THE DURATION. THAT'S BULLSHIT! I JUST... YOU ALLOWED THIS CRAZY WOMAN TO GO AND BLOW HIS HEAD OFF SO YOU CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE COFFIN AT THE FUNERAL. THE FATHER OF YOUR KIDS. THE MAN YOU TOOK VOWS WITH. THE GUY YOU SHARED YOUR BED WITH. HOW DARE YOU JUDGE ME? I NEVER WANTED ANYBODY HURT. YOU WANTED IT THEN. YOU'RE TWISTING THINGS AROUND ON ME! YOU FIXED IT WITH JOYCE TO FINISH HIM! YOU GAVE HER THE GUN, FOR CHRIST SAKES! SHE WAS... I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST BULLSHITTING. I... I CALLED HER BLUFF. AFTER ALL THIS WHILE? JAMES'S BRUTAL MURDER? ALL HER THREATS? SHE CALLS YOU UP AND SAYS SHE'S GOING TO KILL ARTHUR AND YOU THINK SHE'S BLUFFING? I MEAN, THE WOMAN'S A MURDERER! YOU'RE TELLING ME SHE'S A MUR..! UNLESS, OF COURSE, SHE ISN'T A MURDERER. SHE IS A MURDERER. SHE KILLED MY HUSBAND. SHE DESTROYED... THE ONLY THING IN LIFE THAT MATTERED TO ME. WELL, YOU KNOW SOMETHING? THAT I BELIEVE. THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SITTING HERE. BUT THE DAY ARTHUR WAS KILLED YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE HER. YOU SAID, A MOMENT AGO, YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS BLUFFING. WHICH BRINGS ME RIGHT BACK TO... JAMES AND WHAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME ABOUT THIS WHOLE STORY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WELL, YOU SEE JOYCE THREATENED FOR YEARS TO GET RID OF HER HUSBAND BUT YOU NEVER TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. EVERY TIME JOYCE CALLED, YOU JUMPED-- THE VAN, THE LOG BOOK, JAMES' PERSONAL EFFECTS THE GUN, THE WHOLE COVER-UP. I THOUGHT I WAS PROTECTING HER HELPING HER. THAT JUST DOESN'T WASH, CYNTHIA. YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN I LAY IT OUT FOR YOU. WHY DOES A YOUNG WOMAN-- A MOTHER-- RISK EVERYTHING IN LIFE FOR A FRIEND WHO'S TORMENTING HER? THAT WHOLE TIME, YOU DIDN'T ACT LIKE JOYCE WAS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY. YOU WERE ACTING LIKE SHE WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING-- SOMETHING SHE HAD OVER YOU. SOMETHING YOU DID. WHAT YOU WANT IS A LIE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT? WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT BECAUSE I'M NOT SAYING SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO. SOMETHING THAT IS A FUCKING LIE. OKAY? YEAH, YOU LIE TO ME. I WANT A LIE. BRING IN MRS. URBANSKI. OKAY, CYNTHIA. I'M NOT GOING TO LOCK YOU UP RIGHT NOW. YOUR KIDS NEED A MOMMY MORE THAN I NEED AN ARREST. I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO HOME. I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. LET ME WALK YOU OUT. CINDY... YOU KNOW, I'M IN A REAL TOUGH SPOT HERE. I GET THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING BACK IN THERE AND, UH... ORPHANING JOYCE'S SON. BUT, YOU KNOW... THEN AGAIN, THE TRUTH IS NEVER EASY, IS IT? THANKS FOR COMING IN. (Carnival sounds) Cynthia: JIMMY? JIMMY? (Groans) AH, JIM, GIVE ME THESE KEYS. COME ON. NO, DON'T. DON'T JOSTLE ME. COME ON. I'M GOING TO BE SICK. HEY! HEY, COME ON. COME ON, LEAVE OFF, JIMMY. STOP IT. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LAY DOWN. COME ON. JIMMY, LET GO. COME ON. LAY DOWN WITH ME. I DON'T WANT TO LAY DOWN WITH YOU. YOU'LL LIKE IT. JUST LAY DOWN FOR A SECOND. JESUS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO, I DON'T..! HEY! NO! NO! SOMEBODY HELP ME! NO, JIMMY... Jimmy: JUST FUCKING RELAX! (Sobbing) SHUT UP! NO! NO, NO, NO... JIMMY... (gasps and cries) WHOO, WHOO, WHOO! I AM WINNING! YES, I WON! WHAT? ALL RIGHT. HE'S BLEEDING. DON'T WORRY. WE'LL SAVE HIM. LET'S JUST... JIMMY? (Groan) (gasps) SHIT! CYNTHIA, HE'S BLEEDING ALL OVER. LET ME SEE. NO! HE'S OUT. HE'S ASLEEP. ASLEEP? OR UNCONSCIOUS? BECAUSE IF HE'S ASLEEP, WE CAN WAKE HIM UP. GIVE ME THE KEYS. GIVE ME THE KEYS. WE'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL. HE'LL GET A TRANSFUSION. HE'LL BE FINE. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LET'S GO! COME ON! COME ON! I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIM. I'M SO SORRY. HE JUST LEFT ME NO CHOICE. JOYCE, I'M GOING TO GO TO JAIL FOR THIS. I CAN'T GO TO JAIL. WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS? SHIT! DID HE TRY TO FUCK YOU? JOYCE, PLEASE DON'T. THAT SON OF A BITCH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL'S THE OTHER WAY. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? JOYCE? WE GOT TO TURN AROUND. WE GOT TO TURN... WHAT THE FUCK? TURN AROUND. WHAT THE FUCK'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? WHAT IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE US? WHAT IF JIMMY WAKES UP? WE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER. IT IS TOO LATE. WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE AND LEAVE HIM. OH... OH... OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT AM I DOING? Woods: READY? LET'S GET STARTED.
