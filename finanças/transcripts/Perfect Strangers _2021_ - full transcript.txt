…actually during the eclipse The Moon is at its shortest distance from Earth, which makes it appear much larger. Tonight, the Moon will enter the shadow of the Earth at 23:12, Romanian time. When the Moon passes by the Earth, our planet blocks almost all the sunlight that falls on the surface of the satellite, the only light that reaches it is diffracted by the earth's atmosphere, resulting in a reddish and superstitious color. A certain amount of food corresponds to the weight of the puppy. Yes Yes. I'm listening. Yes, you hide the pill in his food. Yes. Next time you go and stay for half an hour for some cookies. - Mother could do it. - Yes, he could, only he put whole apples. - Come on, finish it! Who are you calling? - Your mother. - You're going to wake them up. - I'm sure I'm not sleeping. - He told you that he sleeps after... - I don't hear anything! Hello! - Put the phone away, mom. - Oh, should I move away? Aha! You said you'd put them to bed as soon as we left. An hour has passed. I let them play for a bit, of course! You just know them… - I know, they are just my children. - Mother, don't hold them too long, please. I'll make sure to put him to bed on time. These children are my soul and life. I always make sure that they are fed, that they are put to bed on time... - Know. - Sure you do. - You know, right? - I know, mom. I said I know. Well, if you know so well, why don't you fix that curmudgeonly wife of yours? I hear you, mommy. - Did mom tell me? - He didn't call you "mommy". You thought it! You call me mom? Aren't you ashamed? Mom, he didn't call you mommy. You misunderstood. I who sacrifice myself to take care of the children! Mother, please put the children to bed. - I'm taking my time... - Mom, calm down, mom. Yes Dear. I calmed down. Not! That I was a little heartbroken... - Mom kisses you! - I love you mom. I love you! Of course it's the dispatcher, calling me to work. - Do you go out dressed like this? - Here you go? - Do you go out dressed like this? - Yes. Why? You do not like it? - Where are you going? - I told you where I was going. At Zoe's. - I do not believe. - Then don't believe me. Are you going to Matei? No, I'm not going to Matei. I just told you I was going to Zoe's. By lying all the time, you are doing more harm to yourself than to me. Why do you keep hitting me on the head so much? I told you I was going to Zoe's. If Matei is going to be there, I'm not going to pretend I don't know him just because you're a wild 80's girl. - What are these? - You walked in my things? So I can't believe it, you're walking me through things. - Say what are these!? - Write on the box. - They are not mine. - Why do you have condoms in your bag? Zoe asked me to hold them. Do you take me for a cretin? Zoe why couldn't she keep them? Because his mother is crazy! They walk through things! Sound familiar? God, Ana! I can never talk to you normally. Hear! I need some privacy. Am I asking too much? - You drive me crazy every time. - You don't know how much you drive me crazy. Why are you being so mean to mom? You don't know how she treats me when you're gone. You should get a camera, you might get a shock. I think you're exagerating. You don't want to stop though, let's have a normal wine, I don't know what organic means. Come on, me, Andreea, let's get together to see the eclipse. It's a dinner… -...not a tasting. - I know, but Maria always pricks me, and I don't want to give him the chance. You tell him I bought it. He can criticize me if he wants. - It's good like this? - Yes. It's very good. How many teenagers come to your office? How many did you manage to change? Come on, try to see things from a different perspective. It's my child. I can't see things from another perspective. - You are in constant conflict with her. - She is in constant conflict with me. - Yes, but she is 17 years old. - She had condoms in her bag. - How do you know? - That I found them. - You looked for them in the bag. - Yes, I was looking for something. - You rummaged through their personal belongings. - Yes, but that's not the point. - Sure! That's exactly the point. - Stefan, Ana is in a difficult time. He lives the drama of leaving the protection radius of his family. "The drama of getting out of the protection radius..." Do you realize how you make that sound? - How do I make it sound? - It's the natural course of things. Let's let her get out of this range without bothering her too much. It's not good. He needs a role model! That's what I'm trying to say. I totally agree with you. Only she needs you as a mother. Not by the psychologist who judges and criticizes her all the time. Hello! Put these cookies in the fridge. My mother-in-law didn't make them, so you can eat them in peace. Don't run out of teeth. Where is Ana? I brought him something. In her room, leave her there. - And you argued. - Yes, again. - What happened? - She had condoms in her bag. I don't know what I would do if I found a pack of condoms with our little girl. - Our little girl is six years old. - It was just a guess. A bad assumption. It smells like mulled wine. Have you boiled wine? Stefan is feeling creative. He made cinnamon duck. - Cinnamon duck? I don't eat duck. - Sst, that he hears you. - Did you duck? - Come on, it was supposed to be a surprise. - You know very well that I can't digest duck. - But do you digest cinnamon? Let me get you some good wine. Takes! - It's white. - And so? I don't drink white wine. I have burns. You're crazy? This is a super wine. It's smoke! - My chest burns. - Eh...drink water then. I drink water. - You are OK? - Uh-huh. - Do you have any more? - Yes. thank you I'll be there in a moment. Oh… K… - Hey! You look so well! - Thank you. Hey! You're crazy? Why did you have white wine? Didn't I tell you I bought white wine? This is not just any wine. That's organic. Look what it says on the label. - Mmmmm! Say! What does organic wine mean? - What does it mean? It means that it cost 150 lei. Look I have the price here. - Come on, baby, finish it! - Let it be seen... Okay, we'll give you your money back. 150 at the store, but 300 at the restaurant. I'm curious what this girl Ben comes with looks like. Lucia. That's her name. Lucia. It has a name. Really! He also comes with a girl after 10 years. Don't start now… And it's his first serious relationship after the divorce, so please! No jokes, okay? Sounds. Yes. 2C. I've told you a hundred times. Yes, they are all here. Come on! - Is it Ben? - Yes, Ben. He came fat! - Hello! - Hello! - What the? - Where is it? - Who? - How "who"? - The lady you were supposed to come with. - Lucia. Oh, he can't come anymore. He had indigestion. - I do not believe! - Come on, run! - Well... isn't he coming? - Not. I told you, if he has indigestion... What a shame. We would have liked to meet her. - Should I stay or go? - Come on... Of course... Welcome! I am sorry. - You are OK? - Yes. - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Come on, admit it, has he already left you? - Tell him the truth! - I don't say anything. - Wait, wait! You had a fight? - No, we didn't fight. Stop asking so many questions. What the? She is sick. Point! Come on! - They argued. - She's sick, I told you. She is sick… How beautiful she is. I see two. - Wow! Yes, actually two. - How can there be two? Leave the nonsense. Drink another glass of wine and you'll see four. Leave it to me. leave me - So, Lucia is a very beautiful name. - Yes. - Ben and Lucia. - Who is the girl? Is it something serious? - I don't know... - How do you not know? Aren't you in love? I do not know. How can I tell if I am? I just know that I like it. Maria, how does one know they are in love? why are you asking me Aren't you a psychologist? Isn't that what you do? If you call her three times a day, you're in love. If you call her at five, you're super in love. And if you don't call her at all, it means you're married. Come on! Everyone at the table, please! How many moons do you see? - Two. - How can it be two? It's not good at all. - Hmm, it's spicy! - Yes it is. - Yes, this sauce is so good. With what? - With capers and olives. Last summer I had the opportunity to bring a ton of capers from Africa. - A ton? - Yes, a ton. And when you think that in our country a box costs 50 lei. Are you serious? I should get some land, grow some capers! - Where? With us in Bărăgan? Capers? - Yes, what's up, me? With a greenhouse of this… Why are you laughing, me? It's a super good deal. - Mathematically, it works. - This is the first meal without Clara and Paul. - Here you go? - I realized now that it's the first meal without Clara and Paul. - I spoke to Clara and she greets you all. - How is it? - She's not very happy. - I think so too. It's not easy to find out that your man is cheating on you with someone your daughter's age. After a while it will pass... It's menopause, not a cold. There's no way he'll pass them. - Yes... - Good evening. I have an order for this address. - Maria! - Yes. - Aah! The snails have come! - Did you order snails? Your order: eight portions of snails and two salads. Yes rightaway! - Forget it, thank you very much! - Thank you. And now with Paul what is happening? What to happen? Nothing. He has no wife and no children. - With a 22-year-old kid. - Hell on earth. - What the? Sounds tempting, right? - Come on! A stupidity. A family destroyed by a message. No no! A family destroyed because of a 22-year-old girl. Unfulfilled. - Eh! If Clara didn't read that message... - What do you mean? Is it Clara's fault? - That he read the message? - No, that's not what I meant. But the messages must be deleted. If you have a mistress, you are also careful. Not? - What do you want to say? - Why are you taking care of me, love? I just told you earlier that not me. I said I would have been careful if it were me... - How hot it was here. - Yes. Toma is right. I think we should be careful. - What should we pay attention to? - On the phone. This is the black box of our lives. It happened to them, but you can imagine how many divorces would there be if everyone walked into each other's phone? That's true. Marcu would never let me look at his phone. - Take it, dear, you can look. - You know I'll be watching! Take him! His hand is shaking! Why is he trembling, everything is pale! Look at him! - Take him! I insist. Yes, give me yours too! - I'll give it to you. What do you think you will find? Messages from the pediatrician and from your sister, who asks me if your mother has any more tantrums. What tantrums does mom have? The one where she screams that she knows how to raise children! That he raised you and look how well you have arrived. - And my sister, why is she writing to you? - Because you don't answer him. Of that! - Would you leave Toma in your phone? - Yes, I don't have a password. Yes, it doesn't. But you, would you let Stefan look into your phone? But I don't care what she has on her phone. I really don't care. You do not care? No, but it's not normal to look at you on the phone. But if you want, you can look at mine in peace! You will only find work stuff. - Breasts and buttocks. - Takes! No, it's confidential and medical. Satisfied? - She saw and I'm not allowed? - It's confidential. So you're saying that none of you have secrets. - Here you go? - We are all saints. What secrets should we have? We know each other since we were little. - Yes? Then let's play a game! - What game? I do not know. We could make it up. That is, if we still have no secrets, we could put our phones on the table and all we get tonight, emails, messages, calls, Whatsapp, we look at them all together and read them out loud. Why are you looking at me? Yes, it could be fun. - Fun? I doubt. - I'm getting in. I was really thinking how I was going to stay all evening listening to Marcu's songs. It is a good idea. I like. It's easy for you to fit in, because you came alone. Lucia is at home. I would have played anyway. I think it's funny. Normal! Even your mother doesn't call you after seven. - Toma, say something too. - What can I say? What is it, Thomas? Do you have secrets? I get in. - Come on! - Come on, Mark. Stop playing these stupid games. Last time we were playing Activity and we had a fight. - It's gonna be fun. You'll see! - I don't really think it will be funny at all. - Why are you so against it? - I don't think it's a good idea, at all. - Am I to understand from this that you have something to hide? - Me? Not. I'm serious, Stefan. Do you have something to hide and that's why you don't want to play? - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. You're welcome, dear. I'm in! You are satisfied? thank you We play as long as we feel like it. If we get bored, we stop. It's like "Truth or Dare". We loved it when we were kids. Come on, Thomas. It's the second time you've pretended not to hear. - Should I be worried? - Not. - Put the phone on the table. - Look, I'm putting it. It just seems like such a… - Personally, I think it's in bad taste. - Why? Because only peasants put their phones on the table when they eat. We gathered for a wine to talk, not to play silly games. I suggest we turn off the phones and that's it! Aha! You dodge. That's why Paul always kept his phone closed. - Marcu always keeps him face down. - What are you doing dear, Marcu? You hold it face down. You think I didn't notice? There are things you do instinctively. You take your phone out of your pocket and put it on the table. Some put it face up, some face down. If you put it face down it scratches the screen and it costs you 200 to replace it. - For boys, it's 50. - Let's scratch our screens quietly. You don't even know how much Marcu takes care of his phone. Okay, honey, I'm in the game. You are satisfied? Face up. - What I like! - Me too. Now that we're in the game, let's see what happens. Isn't that a big deal? - Do you agree that we are doing something very stupid? - As big as the house. - Father? - Hello! How beautiful your daughter is becoming! She looks like her mother! Come on, dad! - Can we talk for a minute? - Yes. Excuse me for a moment. - What? - Can you give me some money too? - And you couldn't ask me there? - No, in front of my mother, no. - What happened? - We argued again. This wine is great: 14.5. That's pretty cool, isn't it? - Everything makes me sick to my stomach. - All, all? All from here. Less home wine! - And why didn't you bring the wine from home? - Stingy, that's why. He opens a bottle a week and drinks it with his mother. - Seriously? With mommy? - No, exaggerate. My mother has some health problems and the doctor recommended a glass of wine. It's the first message in the game. It's Toma's. "I miss your body." Who is? Let's start well! I don't know who it is. It's an unknown number. It's a mistake. - Sounds. - It's the same number. - Reply. - How can I answer, if I don't know who it is? Answer and you will find out. - Hello! - Put it on speaker. Hello! Who is? - Hello, who is it? Answer or hang up. - Don't hang up. It's someone, you can hear breathing. We can hear you. Answer or hang up. Hello! what the hell is this Hello! Who is? Thomas, my love, what are you doing? - What a bastard! - I missed hearing your voice. - He called you from Ana's phone. OK. - You `ve done it well. Yeah… Him and his stupid jokes. - No, because I caught myself, I caught myself... - Yes! That's why you turned white as lime! - This game is stupid. - I said this before. Give me that Borsecu too, please. It's super stupid. - Can you give me the phone, I have to go. - Yes, dad. Sorry. - You could say hello. - I said hello earlier. - Thanks, dad. Take care. - Goodbye. is it ok now - Bye, Ana! - Bye, Ana. Have fun! - He said hello earlier. - Yes, he actually said hello. - He doesn't usually act like that. Forgive her! - No, she was nice tonight. - At this age I am hard to control. - I don't know if I would be a good mother. - You are pregnant? - Not. Try? - Let's say... - Yes. Then we must drink in your honor. No, you don't have any holidays yet! The fact that someone is still having sex! Is enough. - Dora! - What the? Take it easy. I haven't even finished the snails! But what did I say? What the? I don't think I offended anyone. I'm sorry if… Everyone knows that after a few years of marriage, sex is no longer the same. Not? These people are trying to make a baby. There was no talk of sex. Okay dear. Then let's make a more appropriate wish. For the children! And for the meaning they give to our beautiful existence! Luck! I think it was better to hate with sex. Ben, do you always have something to comment on? Let's wrap up this topic: sex. I don't want to finish! I don't like this conclusion that has been reached! Seriously, I don't like the idea that life is pointless without children. - Children... are a matter of comfort. - The kids? Comfort? - I don't think you know what you're talking about. - Sure. Socially it is very comfortable. You found someone, you had children, that's it, you fit the mold. Stop asking yourself: "Guys, when are you going to find someone?" "Hey mom! Can't you find a girl too?" I don't want to have a baby just to fit the mold. I have other reasons too. - Which? Day one! - I do not know. - For a couple it is a fulfillment. - It's stupid. That's like you can't be happy together. After you have a child, no one can be happy, because your happiness will depend on another, third being. You're kind of harsh. I'm tough, but I want my happiness to depend on me and me alone. You can say I'm also selfish. And that's it, I'm going to die selfishly. You will die selfish and alone. Having a child seems like a generous thing to me. Not necessarily. Sometimes you may choose to have a child just out of fear of getting old. Many believe that a child can bring them a new life. I do not know what to say. To me, the most beautiful moment seems to be when I put Zora to bed. He looks at me and says: "Mommy, you are the most beautiful!" And I'm really happy! Happy, happy, happy! Why do you have to say it three times? We all got it. Or was it an echo. Was it an echo? Wait until she turns 16 and you'll see how happy you'll be! Give me the water, please! It seems to me that the role of children is to give us a second chance... Through them you relive the stages of your own existence. I don't want to relive any stage of my life. That's because you've had a shitty life. why are you numb - It's my sister. What I do? - Reply. That's the rule of the game. - Hello... - Put it on speaker. - Hello! - Don't talk nonsense, you're on loudspeaker. - You are stupid? - On speaker? Stop it, please! - I can not. - Why? We are playing a game. - Hello, Laura! - Hi! Come on, let's talk tomorrow. If it's about that job in Constanța, I'm not interested. - Talk tomorrow. Bye! - Bye! Kiss you. - Sorry for messing with... - It was seen. What job is it about? A substitute position at a high school in Constanța. - Can we help you with something? - Not. I will solve this thing myself, without emotions and without moving to Constanța and calmly. Why don't you sue them? The state can't kick you out. They didn't kick me out. They terminated my position. - And why don't you want it? - Because it's too far. - It's not Dorohoi, it's still Constanța. - I would like to live in a resort. People are more relaxed! It's a more relaxed world. It's different. - You... would you move to Constanța? - Yes. Even tomorrow. - Even tomorrow? - Yes. - Thomas, did you hear? - Yes I heard. If they received an offer, he would even move to Constanța tomorrow. But with me. - He forgot to specify it, didn't he, love? - Yes love. Keep going! - Stefan, can you help me collect? - Let them, let them have more. - I finished. Thanks a lot! - It was very good. Here you go. Delicious. I am not okay. - What's here? - Broccoli puree. I don't say anything anymore. - Don't eat, the Lollo salad is coming. - What salad? - What is this? - Cabbage, cinnamon and broccoli puree. It's mine. It's dad. - Hi, dad. - Hi Cherrie! How are you? - We are having dinner with some friends. - We talked, everything is OK. Dr. Bârlădeanu - he can operate on you next week. - Yes, father, thank you! Kiss you. Good night! Did something happen? What operation is it about? It's nothing serious. It is an augmentation mammoplasty. - A mom... what? - I am enlarging my breasts. Can you have me too, please? Some wine, please! - You? Are you getting breast augmentation? - Yes me. But why? You are a psychologist. And so? Psychologists don't get breast augmentation. - Yes, it's a bit strange. - But what do they do? Nothing. But why not, if that's what I want? You shouldn't want to, Maria. You are a psychologist. Yes, as a psychologist you should accept your body, right? So for you, a woman who gets breast augmentation is not acceptable? - Yes. - Not. OK. In this case, I accept my whole body, minus the breasts. - Why doesn't Stefan do your operation? - Exactly, because the other one must... to pay for it, and I don't think it's that cheap. Because daddy wants the best for his little girl. Professor Bârlădeanu lives in Vienna, operates in Cluj. He's the surgeon to the stars. I remove the fat from the cashiers and hairdressers. Her father wanted his daughter to marry a neurologist or a cardiologist, not me. And you start with your ridiculous complex? - Am I wrong? - A husband cannot operate on his wife's breasts. Any sexual fantasy will disappear. It's like you coming to me for therapy. I have a proposal. Bârlădeanu gives you a tit, and Ștefan gives you a tit... And after that you go to your father and ask him: which one is the most beautiful? All kidding aside, my wife does not need breast surgery. It's a fad. - How pretty! He gave you a compliment. - Because of the eclipse. Maria is right. It's like going to her for therapy and not… Not. You did not understand! Stefan doesn't want to hear from the psychologist. He wouldn't spend his life on a psychologist's couch. Because he doesn't believe in it. I think so, but I would be sorry for the time. I can't sit on a couch for an hour. Yes! That you don't spend 12 out of 12 on the couch at home! What's wrong with you? Did you need someone to make fun of and you found me? Stefan doesn't want to hear from the psychologist. Such examinations seem stupid to him. - Not. - Sure. Say it... I'm not mad! Our jobs have a lot in common. You fix minds, I fix bottoms and breasts. We make people feel good. It's just that it takes you two years, me... two hours. - Did I tell you he doesn't believe? - I'm going out to smoke. - Come on, I'll come too. - Does anyone want any more wine? Just me? Good. - How is it? - Fairly covered. - Ben, I have a problem. - What problem? Please… It's no big deal. You know... I have a friend who every night around ten sends me... A good night message? Something like that! Yes... a picture. What kind of picture? A picture of her. - At ten? - Yes. - Unlucky, you still have a little. - No, wait a minute, it's not what you think. - That's right... a joke. For fun. - For fun? - I bet your wife won't laugh. - Exactly. This is where you come in. - You mean? - I mean we have the same type of phone. We change them until the picture comes and then we change them back. Why? So that I can be the bastard, right? - Ben! Who cares? You are alone. - I'm not. I'm not alone anymore. Shut up! Tonight you are alone. I barely met the girl. I didn't get to tell him I was married. Help me! Please! Come on, we've been friends since third grade. - I feel stupid doing this thing. - How are you feeling? Are you feeling stupid? I ask you to help me avoid a divorce and you tell me you feel stupid? No problem Ben, I'm going to divorce Dora, we're going to walk the kids around... What should I do if you feel bad? - What kind of picture is it? - It's not a big deal, believe me. It's a picture of her. I don't want you to put me in who knows what embarrassing situation in front of everyone. - You know I hate these situations. - Ben, would I do that to you? It's not a big deal. Two days ago she sent me a picture of her in her pajamas with Pluto. - With Pluto? - Yes, see? It's not a big deal. Pajamas with Pluto… I don't know how to tell you… Stefan goes to a psychologist. Please don't say anything to him. I promised Marcu that I wouldn't tell. Please! It's mine. - It's my wife's. - Steve Jobs? Didn't that die? That's what I knew too, but I see he's calling my wife. It's OK, it's mine. - Steve Jobs is calling you. - Aaa... It's from work. - What the? - Reply. - Not! It's long... it's boring. - So if we cheat, I'm out. - Come on... answer! - So, the gentleman is suspicious. Hello! Alexander? - Mrs. Ionescu? - Yes. Good evening, Alexander! Good evening! I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but I'm going on vacation tomorrow. - Your computer is ready. - Perfect! Thank you. - I leave it at the reception. - Perfect! I take it on Monday. Pleasant holiday! - Yes, where are you going? - At the sea, with my wife. - It's the honeymoon I didn't have. - Good luck! Thank you. - Satisfied? - Steve Jobs? He's the IT guy. What would you like me to call him: Cristiano Ronaldo? - Tomorrow, match. - Yes I received. - And I. - Shall we play at nine? What the? We play tomorrow? I didn't get anything. - Did you kick me out of the team? - Ben, why are you looking at me? You are bastards. Really! Do you only call me when you need a doorman? And have you forgotten that I'm the only professional here? - What the? Did you forget I'm a PE teacher? - That's it, exaggerate! "Dispatcher Carina - call me urgently" With three exclamation marks. Who is this Carina that you urgently need to call with three exclamation marks? - The taxi dispatcher. - "Car for Gemini Square 10 minutes." Colleague, yes, answer him! These are the rules of the game. I answered Steve Jobs. - Not. Ready. Stop game. - No game stoppage. Answer, that's the game! - No, it's going to ruin our whole weekend. - Exactly. - So if we cheat, I'm out. - Hello, hello, hello! Put the phone down. If I answer, I have to go to work. Really, is that what you want? - Reply! - Not! Is right. Let's not exagerate. It's a work phone! Do you want him to get up from the table now and leave? Is that what we want? Seriously. Let's eat! Come on, it's getting cold! Please! Take it! Excuse me, what was that? - An app to lose weight in 20 weeks. - And... you lose 20 kilos? - No, eight. - What a prick. - Did you start today? - No, yesterday. - Every time he calls, I have to do this. - And night? If it beeps, yes. I don't want to cheat. I will be a responsible sports teacher. I want to be an example! And in this way, maybe football messages are no longer lost. Stefan, are you coming? Yes. - It's bad? - It's horrible. - Ben, do you have a cigarette, please? - Immediately. - Takes! - Thank you. With pleasure. - I changed them. - Here you go? The phones. I changed them. - Why did not you tell me? - What? That you go to therapy. - I've been going for a while. - How long? - For about six months. - Not so little time. You're upset? Little bit. You never seemed interested in therapy. Now I'm interested. Maybe it won't help anything, but I wanted to try. If we keep breaking up, at least I know I still tried. - And is it good for anything? - I do not know. Does it use? I do not know what to say. I did learn one important thing though. Stop making every discussion a battle for supremacy. The couples that last are the ones where one of the two takes a step back when needed. I don't want us to end up two weirdos, me to stuff myself with anti-depressants and you to fill yourself with plastic surgery. We don't want that, do we? Not. It's Ben's. A picture from someone named Isa. - Jesus? - How mysterious! - Yes... Who is Isa? - A co-worker. - A teacher? - She's not a teacher. She's an accountant. He works in offices. He does an internship with us and sometimes sends pictures. Not very often. - Come on, show us! - Not! They're boring. It doesn't have... - I don't even open some of them anymore. - Play the game, Ben! Show us the picture! - Those are the rules. Show us! - Really? He doesn't look at them either. - Let's watch together. - Come on, show us! Come on! Ben, you're breaking it. - What the? - Did the screen break? - Give me the phone! - No no no… Okay, Ben! How cheeky you are, Ben! It's good, Isa. Good bad! Mother! - Look, Marcu, how flexible she is! - Yes, she is... flexible. - See! - It's not for girls. Stefan, come here. That's your specialty. - Are you ready? - Yes. Show me! Come on! - Look how flexible she is! - Wow! Wait, it's the other way around. I don't know how to look at her. - Wait! - See! Were you supposed to come with her tonight? Not. Come on... pick up the phone! It's ugly, seriously. It's not ugly at all. - Look, Mark! - Yes... I saw it, mom. I saw! But who is Isa? It's impossible to make a girl like this indigestion. - Isn't my game fun? - Sure! Who is Isa? Say, who is Isa? It's not... It's a joke. I mean it's for fun, it's nothing serious. - I like your humor. For Jesus! - Compromise... I don't know her, but I already like her. Come on, Marcu, don't be so grumpy! For Isa. - Whose is this? - Yours. Yes! It's mine. - What is this ridiculous ringtone? - I have no idea, I think the children were playing. Message from Lucian. He asks me what I'm doing. Cute. - Who is Lucian? - It's... a colleague from work. He works in legal. Yes, you met him at a party. I do not remember. Not? See, that's your problem. You never remember. And why does this Lucian want to know what you're doing at this hour? Because we had a fight yesterday. From an invoice. Please, it's stupid to talk now. So make up your mind! How is it? Stupid or cute? Both, dear. Can it be both? - And you don't answer him? - Not. I don't understand people who don't respond to messages. What does it cost you? The man was nice, you saw. He wrote to ask you how you are doing. How long will it take you to write back: I'm fine, I'm home and ready. - How to say he's home, if he's not? - Is that so. To say something. Then say "I'm fine, thank you, I'm having dinner with my friends". Yes! I rather say this. But why tell where it is? It's a matter of principle. What the? Is there no such thing as privacy these days? These conversations used to start with "Hello, how are you, are you okay?" Now he asks you directly: "where are you?" Stop asking if you're okay. My business where I am. You understand? Why should I tell you? And what the hell do you care where I am? - Ben, yes… why are you scolding us? - These things destroy us and steal from us identity and we leave them without realizing it. Ben, I'm not answering. Bravo! Do not answer. Well, yes, this eclipse is seriously damaging you. One two three four five six… one is missing. Ah! Stay. So. - Whose is that? - Aah! Stephen's. - I have an email too. - Wait, we'll take them one at a time. Stefan? What the? - You got away with it this time. Tell him, Dora! - Oh! Not! It's an email, it's long, it's boring. What do you mean boring? Follow the rules. Yes, I read! "Amurg Senior Residential Center. Answer to your request." "I confirm that I have received the application submitted to" "Amurg Senior Residential Center. We will contact you soon to take advantage" "of the first three months free of charge after confirming the final registration." "Mihaela Popescu, director of the Amurg Seniors Residential Center." - What a thing! - Dusk? I don't even know who these fools are... they sent me an email at this hour. - Is this an asylum? - No... yes... I remembered. I was with a colleague two weeks ago. He wants to move her on his mother there, I looked, it was beautiful and I asked for some information. - You also asked for some information. - Yes. Who asks for some information at an asylum? Look, some ask for more. And if you went with your colleague to a funeral, would you ask if there was a free grave? - Not. - How "no"? They said you filed a claim. You want to send mother to the asylum? - It's not an asylum, okay? - Dora. It's a residence. It is very beautiful. That woman adores you. She takes care of everything despite her hip problems. - Is that why he drinks red wine, for his hip? - Ben, don't get involved. He takes care of everything, the house, the children... - Yes. That's why he gets accommodation and meals. - Here you go? - Do you want me to ask mom to pay rent? - Why not? He has a pension, right? You know very well how much we save with nannies. Okay, we do as you want. We take nannies and goodbye holidays. At least she admits that she is no longer the same in the house. "The same" in what sense? - He doesn't know which way to go. - Very good. Keep going… Finish! You know very well what I mean. You know very well what this is about. - Yes! - Not. - Yes. - I do not understand. - Yes Yes. - No no. Yes Yes Yes… - Are you saying that the two of us don't do it anymore? - Yes. I think so. He's in the next room. It is true that, subconsciously, mother's proximity can have a castrating effect. - Castration, it is known! - Yes, castrater. That's the word. Yes, no... I mean, I love my mother-in-law, but I couldn't live with her in the house! I couldn't stay with my mother either. He can pay the rent. Modern asylums are really great. They have four stars. - It's not an asylum! - Know. It's a residence. Marcu, now you have to admit, your mother is a little... I mean, a little is a lot... Come on, you know, it's your mother. how is mom - When I was little I was afraid of her. - Me too. He had those big hands. He hit harder than my father. We all respect her, but you also admitted that she can be a bit difficult. - Seriously? - Yes. Even you said that. - I admit, it has a more difficult character. - Amen. After 25 years, he also admits that his mother is crazy. - What time is it? It's ten. Eclipse! - Let's get out. Come to the balcony. - No no no! The phones on the table... - I'll take him to take a picture. - You do, the rest don't. - Come on! Is wonderful. I don't know why, but I see both. One over the other. It's an optical illusion. It is the Earth's shadow that forms another ring. Can you let me take the picture? Forget… Toma, let's sit down a bit like this... We do this part. Doruta, come in too. And we gather a little, so that the eclipse can be seen. It will be seen, that I got him a trick phone. Come on! One two… - What does he want at this hour? - I do not know. - Yes, who is it? - Her ex-boyfriend. Yes, what does he want? - I do not know. He just said hi. - Come on. We put ourselves back together and... Attention! - Ben, wait a minute. Is it her ex-boyfriend? - Yes, the ex. One two… - Smile, Thomas. - Keep calm, because I don't care about him. I know you don't care! I was saying that too, that it's the ex. Yes. It's the ex. Come on, one, two... Why did you name him Ivan? That's his name! That's his name. Ivan. How did you want me to spend it? With full name. With name and surname. That's how you put my brother on the phone. You didn't pass it Mihai. When you call someone on the phone with their first name, it means they are a close relationship. And clearly you cannot confuse her with another person. - For real, Tomita, it's her ex-boyfriend. - What does the former mean, the ex! - Yes! The ex! Or "sex". - You're incredible. No, but in my opinion exes are very dangerous. - We can take the picture after that too... - Yes. - Especially since she gave him the slippers... - Finish, because I know what you want to do. - Are we taking that picture or what are we doing? - Ben decides! - Ben, are you concentrating? - You're kidding, right? Come on, smile. I don't get angry at all, because I know the guy is harmless. Come on! Attention… one, two… "I'm in the mood for sex." - Calm down. - I swear I'll kill him. - What is this? I kill him. - It's not what it seems. So what is this "I'm in the mood for sex" message? - He doesn't want me. - But who? What, is this a group message? Stop laughing, me! - Calm down. - So what is it? Tell him! Ivan has been seeing a girl for a few months and for her it's just sex and he pretends it's for him too. - And why is he writing to you? - Ivan just pretends that for him too, but in fact he is dead after her, he is like a mad dog. He doesn't know how to tell them and ask me. If he's rabid, go to the vet, not my girlfriend. - And you, Marcule, stop laughing! - Well, your wife is a veterinarian. He wants to go to the vet. Thomas, wait! Thomas! - I help you? - Yes please. What are you doing? Let's go to the balcony to take that picture. - Leave me alone with your picture! - Toma, calm down. Is it because of Ivan that you're doing this? Give me the phone, I'll call him. - No no! I don't have to, because I don't care. - I care. If you think I'm jealous, you're wrong. Lunar eclipses are also used to measure the cooling rate of the crust during the interval in which it lacks… Thank you for calling me. Sorry to bother you, but it was urgent. - He called you? - She invited me to her place. Don't go, it will be even worse! It can't get any worse. I'm terribly depressed. I feel physically ill. I'm going. Why did you call me if you made up your mind? - Who else should I call? - Well goodnight. - Thank you. - Bye. - Are you satisfied? - Does he call you often? - Whenever he feels like... - I understand. Enough. When he calls me, he cries. What do you want me to do, shut them down? Give Maria's number, let her go crazy. He needs a psychologist, not his ex-girlfriend. See I heard you. For those who haven't had enough, a cheese platter. - Ben, can you help me? - Thank you. God At last we eat, my God! Don't worry, I'm opening a special wine for that. - Is good? - Uh-huh. Sorry. - Dora, are you okay? - Here you go? - I was asking if you were okay. - Yes I am ok. - Give me the plate and I'll put you... - I'm OK. - Sure? - Yes. - Do you know what your ex wants? - What the? She wants to fuck you, she does. - You are ridiculous. - I don't keep in touch with my exes. Because no one wants to hear from you! Stop it, I'm serious! - What do you want me to tell him, stop looking for me? - Yes. It would be better. Yes! Not being able to talk to a friend because your man doesn't trust you. It's not related. I trust her. I don't trust him. I know the kind. I can smell them from afar This is like a dog in heat. Listen! The poor boy is also in heat. That's why he wants to go to the vet. - Madame, pour le fromage. - S'il vous plait, payer les hommages. - Noblesse obliges. - I am directing them. Dora! - Put it on me too, please! - Put it down. Luck! And then the carrot says, "Exactly, why do you ask?" A very good one. - It's Ana. What I do? - Reply! - Yes, dad. Everything OK? - Yes I'm good. can we talk for a bit Sure, he says. I don't know how to tell you. Matei's parents are away and he proposed that I spend the night at his place. Only the two of us. I mean… you get it. Father? - Father? are you still - And what did you answer? I do not know what to do. I'd like to go, but he took me by surprise. I'd like to go, but not tonight. On the other hand, if I say no, things will get weird between us. He may misunderstand and he will surely get upset. What to do? You don't have to go because he gets mad. That's not a reason. If it were up to me, I'd say never do it. Stay daddy's girl. But that is not possible, it is not natural. I'm going to tell you something that you'll probably remember for the rest of your life. This is not something you can talk about with your girlfriends tomorrow. If years from now, when you remember this night it makes you smile, then go to him. But if you're not ready, if you're not sure, then don't do it. You'll have plenty of time for that. - Know something? - What the? - No nothing. Nothing. - Come on, say it please. I was so embarrassed today when you gave me the condoms. I wanted to go into the ground. - I didn't give them to you to use today. - Then for what? Did you feel anything? It's the first time you've given me something like this. Look, if I decide to go to Matei's, tell mom I'm staying at Zoe's, okay? - Why don't you tell him? - What? - The truth. - Are you crazy? Know that you should talk to her. You know how mom is. He gets angry immediately and never listens to me anyway. You have to know how to take it. You have to have a little patience. On the contrary, I have to be very patient with her. OK, a lot. But believe me it will be worth the effort! Give it a try! I think you're too in love with mom to see what a shrew she is. - No, dad, it's not. - Dad, I have to hang up. - Not! Ana, listen to me... - Thank you. Ana... You did very well. The psychologist helped you. I am sorry. You really did it… - It's yours. - Yes. - My colleague... is a bit insistent. - Yes, what does he say? - Let me answer him. - Well, answer him and let's finish once. Not. - Mark, answer him! - I decided not to answer him. - Ben, done, enough! Answer it and that's it. - Good. Answer. "Dinner with friends. Talk to you on Monday." Ready! When I was little, I think I was about 7 years old... 8 years old... I used to go with... - he wrote to you: "you idiot!" - Here you go? Why is this Lucian talking to you like that? I have no idea. It's stupid. I have no idea. He's a cretin. - Look, he's calling you. Answer him! - There's no point, Dora. How can it not make sense? - Hello! - Stop pretending your neck hurts. If you were really sick, you stayed at home, you didn't go out with friends for dinner. What the hell! Hello! I understand. Do not speak. If you want to know what your problem is, you're not sure you like men. So go to hell! That's… that's crazy. What the? Come on, for real? Why are you looking at me like that? My colleague, he's gay, he kind of likes me. That's all. I have nothing to do. - Did something happen between you? - Here you go? I asked you if something happened between you two. Yes or no? Dora, stop the bullshit. I told you, this idiot has fantasies. That's all. Toma, say something too. Stefan, why are you silent? Yes, it's true that poponarians, gays, homosexuals I always think that straight guys are homos and try their luck, they insist, they get it. That's a pretty homophobic statement. You don't suddenly find yourself gay. - There are some previous signs. - Yes, that's what I wanted to say too. Come on! You loved dressing up in dresses when you were little. And Ben can confirm. Stefan, finish! Mark! Did it happen between you? Dora, we have been married for 15 years, we have two beautiful children. It's me, your husband. Dora, look at me! Dora. Look at me. Do you see me with a man? Day! You see me? Yes or no? Not that it's a bad thing, it's just that I like women. I mean I like you. Dora, I swear. I swear, between me and this… - Lucian. - Lucian, it's nothing. I swear on the lives of our children. You believe me? OK. "I miss your lips." He swore on the life of my children. I married a monster. Dora! A monster. Dora! I do not know what else to say. Don't say anything. Leave it as it fell. - Thomas, what do you have? - Nothing. - I'm fine. You're good? - Yes I'm good. It means we are fine. Give me the glass too, please. - Listen, do you have a problem? - Not. The water is very healthy. In 25 years he didn't tell us anything. Of course, he didn't feel like talking about it. - Forgive me, what was I supposed to say? - What should you have told me? We have known each other since we were little children. May I also know who you are or do you have any other surprises? He's still your childhood friend who you used to talk to about anything. Anything? I do not believe. He missed a small detail and maybe he should have told me. - Did I have to tell you? - Yes. - Why, Thomas? - Because we slept together, Marcule. We showered together. If my best friend is a jerk, I need to know. After that yes, I can decide for myself if I agree or not. But I need to know. "Then I can decide for myself if I agree or not." Can you hear yourself say that? Do you realize what you didn't tell me? - But what is your problem? - Wait a minute! That's what I'm trying to find out too. Listen, do you have a problem with me being a poponar or that I didn't tell you I was a poponar? Tomita, you exaggerate. If I exaggerate that I have a problem, then I have a problem. Come on! Have fun! - Homosexual they say. - What? Homosexual, I can't fit so many syllables in your bull's mouth. - What did you say, me? Repeat that! - In your bull's mouth. - Toma, apologize immediately! - Shall I apologize? Yes. This is what he lied to us about for 25 years and nobody cared. After which he makes me ox and it's good again. No one intervenes. Good. Good thing I'm an ox. Tommy, calm down. It's not a big deal. You are really exaggerating. Seriously! And you no longer drink directly from the bottle, because the situation has changed. Go away, damn it! It's a poponar. That's it… Bulangiu. And I can say that my man... But maybe he's right. Maybe his friend is really obsessed with him. - Many of my patients have phantasms. - If he waxes on his chest, it doesn't mean... How stupid can you be? Don't you understand that they are kissing? They stick their lips together. She misses his lips! It cannot be clearer than that. It's a poponar. - How long has this been going on? - You are ridiculous. - How long? Tell me! - A little time. - Wait a minute. I want to... - No. No need, Ben. - And before him? - What the? How many did you have before him? - How many? - Yes, how many? I never had anyone. Thanks for the dinner. Why now? Come home. The home? Great idea to go home, see the kids...right? That you still swore on their lives. - Dora, please. Come home. - Not! You're going home alone! I stay here, I drink vodka. - Dora! - Dora stays here! - Does anyone know a jeweler Max? - It's mine. Let him. - Hello, Tom? Thomas! - I'll give it to you now. What are you doing, me, are you crazy? - Yes, Max. - You listened to my messages, I left you... Yes! It's a little complicated tonight. I'll call you tomorrow and we'll talk. I was becoming paranoid. I thought it was about the chain. - I said you don't like it. - Yes, I like it. - And they? Did she like it too? - Yes. That's right, me! Did I tell you to trust me? It's not gold, it's deceiving. Allright then! Come on, I'll call you and we'll talk tomorrow! Bye! Okay, me, okay! Wait, wait! Another thing! The earrings? Did she like the earrings? I'll call you tomorrow and we'll talk. Who was supposed to like earrings? To nobody. How no one? Who are the earrings for? For you. I haven't worn earrings in years. My ear holes were also clogged. Thomas, you knew that. Yes I know. That's why I didn't give it to you. We should stop this game. Seriously! It's a stupidity. My love... Dispatcher. What else does he want? Don't give up! - Are the earrings for her? - No love! He wants to call me to work. What are you doing? Give me the phone. Andrea, give me the phone. Hello! Thomas, hello! Boyfriend! My love, I must see you. I did a test and two dashes came out. The box says this means positive. Positive means I'm pregnant, right? Hello! My love! Wait, love! forgive me Please forgive me. - Love, open! - Get out of here, you bastard. Love, open! You hear me? Dora! - Disappear, Toma. - Dora, open it. Love, forgive me. Forgive me, love! Let me explain. Andrea, can you hear me? Andrea! Dora, open! Why is he doing such a thing? Why did he do that? We just got engaged. We have sex every day. Why would a man do such a thing? Why did she mix that dispatcher into our story? Why did he bother to convince me that he loves me, if he does such a thing? Yes, why does she sleep with men? - Disappear, Tomita! - It's me, Dora. Open. - Fuck you too! - You just received a message on Facebook. Someone wants to know if you're wearing panties. It's not what you think, Marc, I swear! I don't know the guy. We have never met. I swear! - On the lives of our children? - Mark, listen to me. It's just a game. We text each other occasionally. That's all. - I see these games are in fashion now. - Hear me out. I have never seen him! - Well, call him. The time is right, Dora. - How do I call him? Can't I call him at this hour? He has a private life, he has a family. - And you don't? - It's nothing serious. It's only virtual. If it's nothing serious, call him. Look, he left your phone number too. God! You've been talking for over seven months. - Marcu, we never called each other. - Now is the right time. Look! - You're an asshole. - Possibly. - Hello! Dora? - Speaks. - You are? - Yes I am. - I am sorry. Shouldn't I have written to you? - Sure! - What a surprise! - I want to see you. We decided never to do this, but… If you changed your mind, we could meet. Not! Better not. Sorry, but I have to close. - A second. You have a beautiful voice. - You hear them! - Out of curiosity, do you carry? - What should I wear? Panties. Do you wear or not? - Mark. - Shut your mouth. - What do you care? That you're gay. - That doesn't stop me from being curious. So do we carry? Come on, Dora. - Mark! - Leave me alone. - So you wear? - Finish. Finish! Are you satisfied? If you don't love me, why the hell don't you leave me? Why the hell don't you leave me? You make such a fuss over some panties. Let me tell you something you won't find in my phone. Let me speak! On the night of the accident, I was driving! No Mark. He took the blame on himself, but I was. I was drunk and I would have gone straight to jail. And what were we doing with the children? What was our name? I chose the lesser evil. Only a man died and I can't consider him the lesser evil. Dora, done. Ready. Done with what? Done with what? Don't you realize we never talked about this? As if nothing had happened. All that united us all these years was this feeling of guilt. Everything you made me feel all these years… Why didn't we break up? In life it's good to know when to break up. You could have told me you were gay. We would have broken up more easily. The truth is that… I'm the poponar. - Here you go? - Poponar, bulangi, it's me. Yes, you can tell me what you want. How your upbringing and instincts dictate your tagma-protecting heterosexuals. I told you it was a bad idea to switch phones. Psychologist, know that I had no previous symptoms. I am sorry. And I didn't wear dresses as a child either. I'm really sorry. Ben, you have nothing to feel sorry for. I was gay almost twice and believe me, I've had enough. I mean I understand why you didn't tell us. - Is that why they kicked you out? - What do you say? But they are not allowed to do that, you can sue them. Look how you who are my friends reacted. How do I go to a courtroom? How can I sit there and talk about it with the judge, with lawyers, with a full courtroom. With family! I liked the game because it was like a movie where the murderer is slowly revealed. And I was hoping to be discovered too! But not like this. Not like this. It would be normal to introduce your friend to us too. On Lucian. I do not believe. I'm used to these jokes of yours. Right from the third grade. I think he would feel bad at the first glance or the first dumber joke. And I don't want that. If you love someone, you protect them, not expose them. Goodbye. Andrea, answer! Andrea, can you hear me? I'm begging you! Help me, it's not responding. Andrea! Let me! Have! I have dysplasia like my mother. Step aside! There's no need. Your mother called you. I told him you are expecting a child. He congratulated me, complimented me... It wasn't me he was supposed to be congratulating. You are right to keep Lucian to yourself. Out of curiosity, who is the girl who sent you the picture? Nobody, it's something virtual. Like your Facebook friend. Let's go home. Mark... We can't live like this anymore. We can't anymore. This game turned our lives upside down. Yes it is. In love and in friendship there must be certain secrets. That's how they work. I am sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Sure! Maybe it's better that it happened that way. At least now we have the certainty that we must divorce. - And you don't go to the psychologist anymore. - Oh yes! Stefan, it's been a long time since I no longer feel happy in this relationship. Know. But I'm glad you finally found the courage to tell me. Luck!
