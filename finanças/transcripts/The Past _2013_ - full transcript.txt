I hurt my wrist Leave it to me.. You've become old too Is there room? Yeah, there's space Stop...Stop What are you doing? The Past Do the girls know that I've arrived? No Didn't you tell them? I was afraid that you couldn't come, like last time Put it in fourth gear Now I'm here, you should warn them I want to see them We're going to see them Where? We'll pick up Luci from school then go home Didn't you book the hotel? No You were supposed to... I wasn't sure you would come. What's that supposed to mean? I wasn't sure Listen, last time something came up.. Two days before my flight... Forget it, it's not important If you start we'll never finish. Because once I had to cancel my flight? No For many reasons The girls will be happy if you come home. I didn't want to put you out. It's not a bother. Anyway, you had to come home to get your suitcase. You can change your clothes so you don't get cold. She was going to fine you if I didn't move What happened? She's gone. Did you tell her we would pick her up? Let's go. Maybe we're late so she's gone home. It's not the first time. Last time she got home at 11. At her age, it's normal. No it's not normal. What's up with her? She has been irritating the shit out of me Can you talk to her? Maybe you work out what is wrong with her. If she remembers me, after such a long time. She loves you very much. Still? Don't go that way...where are you going?... This way. Sorry you forgot everything. I got distracted. - Marie ... Yes - Don't put them there, it's risky Ah! I can't do it all on my own. I just did what you told me to do You're not strong enough. You need to pull the other way. I'll force myself not to scream Ow! You hurt me Is Luci back? No Wait! Wait! Go on! Go on. There, that's it. Come on, pull! Yeah, yeah, yeah Ah, no no! Oh shit, Fouad, you broke it. Pull it firmly. I can't... it's cutting my hand. No, no...Not this way.

We used to put it on that shelf in the shed Ahmad Lea, are you ok? You've really grown up! Hello Sir Your friend is a bit stuck-up!! What's his name? My name is Fouad Hello Fouad. Are you alright? Ahmad, come in And you Fouad, see to your business. Come on. It wasn't in the store So, it must've been moved when I wasn't here. My father has some in his car. What happened to the bookcase that was there? The old one. It was wooden. We threw it out. Really? Some of my books were in that bookcase. Your things are in the storage room. Fouad, take your stuff. I don't like sleeping upstairs. What? I don't like sleeping up there. Do what I said. Watch out for the paint. Wasn't the last colour better? I haven't finished yet, because of my wrist. You should have waited for me. I would have painted it myself. It would've kept me occupied. You were going to go to a hotel. Give it to me. Ouch! You hurt me. Sorry That's enough, thank you. It's ok. I put the car keys here. Thanks. I put you some clothes upstairs. Change them or you'll get cold. What are you doing here? Come on... you sleep up and Luci sleeps down. Luci, call me please, I have a surprise for you. You sleep there while Ahmad is here. Go please... She drives me crazy. Is that your father's car in front of the door? Yes Do you live here? Yes With your father? Yes How long? Since school began. You don't need to make the bed. Come down. Go to your own bed. Go up... Get down. What? One says go up, one says get down. I'm sorry. Why are you coming down again? He told me to come down. You can ask him, with his old beard. There aren't enough beds downstairs. Do you live with someone here? Yes You didn't tell me. What do you mean? I told you in one of my emails. What E-mail? I can't remember, I told you in one of them. I didn't recieve such an E-mail. So, why did you want to go to a hotel? I didn't want to put you out. Anyway, I had told you. But I didn't recieve such an E-mail. So what did you think I told you come to court to get divorced for? Does he know that I'm here? Yes So I should leave. He won't just come when you're here. If he does, he'll let us know. When did you send me that e-mail? I don't know. So it must be in your E-mails now, yeah? Yes, I suppose. Do you want me to show you? You were supposed to book me a hotel. Last time I did, but you didn't come. I had to cancel it. How much did you pay for canceling? When should I be in the court tomorrow? You said you would talk to Luci. When is she coming? I don't know. I'll see her tomorrow. I hoped you would keep your promise just for once in your life. I didn't make you any promise. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Fouad, is it hard for you to look where you put your feet? I just cleaned up and you messed it all up again! Fouad, look at me when I talk to you. Look at me!

I want to go to our own home Do you want me to call there? No one's there What's bothering you here? Because she had a fight with you? You weren't a good kid either You spilled the paint over the floor Didn't you? It's not because of the paint So why? Because I'm here? Do you want me to leave? Hello Madam Hello You ok? Not bad His flight was delayed Has he arrived? Yeah Here you are Where did you park it? Over there Where? There Don't put them in the car, it's risky. Did you go to the hospital today? Yes So how is she? As usual Didn't you bring Fouad? What for? He called me. He wants to leave I had a fight with him, with both of them I'll pick him up tonight, - Don't exaggerate It's the first time that he's called me It's the first time I had an argument with him I promised him Ok, I shouldn't have got angry I'll make it up to him tonight If you wanna come over, let me know beforehand Such great popcorn Fouad, don't do that Take it to him...be careful Take it I don't want it You cut your hand No I didn't. It was like that before It's bleeding Ahmad, he cut himself Luci Ahmad? How did you know it's me? I knew you would come today Little Luci What do you eat Luci? I don't, thanks Come on..please You won't find such a great Qorme Sabzi anywhere else Unless you marry two cool Iranian men You should marry a Persian woman too How is it? You want more? No, it's good What does a Persian woman look like? A Persian woman? Like me, but a woman Like this Did you like that? Always like this? - Does she have a beard? - No Would you like to go to Iran with Ahmad? How are they? Do you always get home late? Just to sleep Really? Because I have no other place to pass the night Why don't you want to stay here? Like yourself... So you move to your friend's home tomorrow This is not my home But your friend's home is? I'm not comfortable here Neither am I Your case is different It's hard for me to see someone everyday who wants to marry my ex-wife She is just your ex-wife now? Yeah It's ridiculous What? You lived with her for several years Now she is just your ex-wife Now everything is different We separated Can you give me a hand? I think you're old enough to understand Old enough not to be advised by everyone I didn't come here to advise you Your mother asked me to have a word with you to see what's wrong with you I don't know why she thinks you're more comfortable with me than her She knows what I'm angry about I don't want to be here when that bastard comes Luci Come, take a seat here for a moment Isn't he a good man? I don't know...I barely know him So why do you call him a "bastard"? What has he done? Nothing In fact, he has no reason to be here Look, your mother is going to marry him It's her right Really? Even someone who has a child and his wife is in coma Fouad's mother? What if she was going to marry someone else? Would that be ok with you? It makes no difference So this guy is not your problem? She has married three men since I was born Every time it's the same thing This one will also stay a couple of years and then will leave us Can you talk to her? What should I say to her? Talk her out of it Kids, are you still awake? Fouad, get up and go to sleep Just two mintues more...please Just two minutes Hi Good night Luci Would you sleep downstairs tonight? Fouad and Ahmad have to go upstairs I made dinner, if you didn't have any Thanks Do you want me to warm it up? No thanks Where did you get the herbs? We went shopping You're still a good cook I still have that at least What time should we be there tomorrow? 9 You don't eat it with a fork Take this Did you talk to her? Yes So what? As you guess She doesn't like you marrying again She is afraid that he'll leave you after a while He won't I think I'm not the right person to convince her That she should be happy about your marriage I didn't say she should be happy I want to understand what will make her happy Stopping you from getting married It made me laugh too Try to convince her before you make your decision I've already made my decision Fouad Yes If you aren't comfortable, we can change our bed No, I'm ok I need to pee Ok, get up... Come on Did you talk to her doctor? No, just her nurse What did she say? What do you mean? The scratches on her stomach She said she did that to herself after I went there Maybe it has nothing to do with you visiting her This may be so Maybe it was unintentional Would you like it to be so? I'm sorry It's too easy to say what you want then apologise Why are you here? It's too dark. I'm afraid to go up Why do you want to go up? I told him to go up with Ahmad. The girls sleep downstairs Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable sleeping next to a stranger Go, get dressed I want to go to bed, I feel sleepy Didn't you tell me to pick you up? I want to stay here Get in, sleep next to me Ahmad, drop it, we'll be late It's clogged Do it later, we must be there at 9 Kids, shake a leg - How are you? - Good Hello kids Hi Hi Hi Samir Sorry, my hands are dirty It's blocked again?

Yeah, it is Hop out Goodbye kids Goodbye Bye mom Bye dear Bye mom Hold on You can go, bye Where did you meet each other? In the pharmacy He used to come and get medicine for his wife What was wrong with his wife? She had depression What's up? What? Hmm....What does that mean?

If you get on my nerves, I'll stop here and go straight to Tehran - I won't divorce you and your plans will be cancelled - You haven't changed a bit Should I pull over? We're late Should I stop?

We want to get some fresh air Ahmad...Take her to the back room there You know why she doesn't tell anyone that his wife tried to commit suicide? Let's talk later Because she doesn't want anyone to know What? That she attempted suicide because of their relationship You shouldn't talk about it with such certainty Especially at your age That woman told me I grew up, but you think I didn't Sorry Ahmad, I don't want them to be together You think it's in my hands or yours? I can't do anything If they get married, I'll never go back to that house Your mother is pregnant with his baby No, that's a lie! Hold on Hold on I told you You know why she went to that filthy man?

No, watch out for the paint It's handle was broken when they delivered it Have you called her friends? No, I can't call them anymore Did you talk to her today? Yes Have got some sort of rope to tie it up with? There's some in a suitcase in the shed You can take them. Are the kids asleep? No Would you turn it on? Would you call the kids to give them their souvenirs What about Fouad? Yes, sure You didn't have any plan for him I've found something for him now May I ask you not to do that Why? He has done something bad that should be punished for Both of them are responsible for that, And both of them should be punished I speak on behalf of my own child What has he done? Without permission they took the present out of your suitcase But the present is here now I put it back I don't want him to think that the problem is solved The suitcase was open, they were tempted I asked them to apologise This way they learn to get away with things by making an apology I told them that I brought them some gifts. I can't ignore that Would you stop it? I punished them enough today I just said if that's possible Hello Hi kids No..no, first they should make an apology Both of them I'm sorry You? I didn't take anything But you were there, weren't you? - But I didn't take anything - It's not important who did You both were there, you should've told her not to do that Say you are sorry Apologize I apologize Say I'm sorry I'm sorry Look at him Apologize I'm sorry Ok, come and take your presents Come on You spoke like I took it I just said I took nothing So I did it Yes, you took it No You told me that the suitcase was open You didn't have to listen to me I know why you're upset Because he gave me a helicopter but you got coloured pencils Shut up You're crazy Shut up - You're sick - Shut up I last took your size four years ago It hasn't changed I've got something for Luci, I'll give it to her tomorrow Thank you Ahmad You smoke alot She hasn't been this late before I'll go look for her Where?

Enough Wait for me please Ahmad His wife had been depressed for a long time Every time I took my clothes to his dry cleaning...she was sick Why? What do you mean 'why'? Forget it Will you speak clearly Look, you said she felt sick No, I didn't say 'she got', I said 'she was' She WAS sick! Forget it, it's degenerating You want to hear that I'm guilty I don't want to hear anything You asked me to talk to your daughter to see what her problem is Now I'm telling you what she thinks Well she's wrong I'll talk to her What are you going to tell her? You think she believes you!? You don't believe it either It's her that has to believe it Why don't you believe it, what's odd about it? I don't think a a mother with a five year old kid would kill herself because of depression YOU are saying that! Have you forgotten what state you were in? She tried to kill herself with a nine month old baby, because I was with you It started when she delivered her baby You want to know what drugs she took? How long are you going to stay in Paris? I haven't bought my ticket back yet, I don't know Couldn't you get a lawyer instead of coming here yourself? I prefered to come here myself to visit the girls and Marie To end everything in a good way Seemingly everything isn't finished yet Some things are unresolved No Why do you think so? When two people see each other after four years and fight It means that some things are not resolved Our argument was about Luci I'm her problem, yeah? No It's a misunderstanding About what? Something personal that I shouldn't know about? No, it's not personal So tell me I don't know if you're aware of it or not, she's pregnant All the time stress - smoking and fighting I'm worried about her, too She didn't smoke before If it was a small problem, she should come to see me She doesn't have any problem, it's just a misunderstanding What kind of misunderstanding is it that has ruined my life Let Marie-Anne tell you Don't involve her, ok? She has an idea about your wife's suicide That she has killed herself because of our relationship You know it yourself I heard you saying that to Marie Ah, I see She did that to herself over a silly fight with a client I've been told that she had depression She wouldn't have done it, if she hadn't A silly fight If Luci doesn't believe it, what can I do? Tomorrow I'll send my employee to talk to her. She was involved in the dispute Call the police and give them her details Has it happened before? No, it's her first time Maybe she's with her father In Brussels? Isn't her father in Paris? He's gone back to Brussels Is it possible she might go there? No She doesn't have a good relationship with her father Do you want me to call him? Let Ahmad do that I don't think she has gone to Brussels I'll call him myself Ok, give me his number Shahryar called, he wants you to call him back Where is the phone? In the kitchen Why does she have this idea? What idea? About C?line's suicide I don't know Here it is Her father's number Don't make him worried She is with Shahryar She went to his restaurant then he took her to his home He called here twice, Why didn't he tell me anything? He knew how worried I was Let me explain Why didn't he tell me she was there? I was about to die, why did he tell me nothing? Ok, I'll explain What are you going to explain? hmm? What do you want to explain? What happened? Nothing I told you in the car, If anything happens you tell me not her And I tell you don't shout at me Why didn't he tell me Luci was there? Luci made him promise She had agreed to stay there on the condition that he tell no one He made a promise to hide a sixteen-year-old girl? Why did he take her to his home? What do you mean 'hide her'? He took pity on her He cares about her not her mother Where are the keys? What for? She has to come back, sit down and talk to me Now Right now She thinks we don't know where she is I don't care She needs to see what a mess she has made. The suicide has nothing to do with us She won't come back with you. I'll call the police if she doesn't I'll really call the police The police can get her back tonight. What about the other nights? She stays here or goes to Brussels to her father She won't come back while I'm here Come in... Why are you so late? Don't you have an umbrella? No Put it here How did you get here? Subway You'd better take a taxi I couldn't find one You've put yourself in the way of trouble. Is she awake? She fell asleep When did she come to you? Late... I thought she was waiting for you You should've informed us at once Her mother was about to die... How?...You don't have a cellphone! I called her home to find you But you were not there either I feared if I told her mother, she would leave What's happened? Some illusions... Sorry to wake you up. She wanted to come herself, but I asked her not to Let's go Where is your coat? No, I won't go there. I don't want to go back tonight. Ok, I'll call her. Talk to her yourself Hello Marie? She wants to talk to you Yeah I'll stay here tonight. Why did you hang up? She put the phone down. Let's go. No. Get up. I want to talk to you. I want you to listen to me carefully. I don't know how well you can remember the last months that I was with your mother You remember anything? You remember how bad my situation was? Yeah. I didn't feel well at all. I didn't work. I didn't get out. I just wanted not to exist anymore. That's why when your mother says that woman committed suicide bacause of depression I completely understand. Even if she had a little kid. Did you think about suicide much? Yes, sometimes. Like drinking laundry detergent in front of us. What? No. You think when a woman drinks laundry detergent and tries to kills herself, when her husband is enjoying himself, she only wants to die? Why not take pills in her bed? We can sit here and make up thousands of these stories. But they're only a guess. Tomorrow we're going to meet Samir's worker. She has something to tell you. Tell her I'm going. She can come back now. We had better not be here for a while. Fouad...get off Get up. Leave me. I told you get up. Come on. Stop it. Thanks. What are you doing? When I tell you get off, you have to do it. Look at me. When I'm talking. Listen to me. Leave me. What did you say? Leave me. Don't do that again to me. Why did you do that? Look at me. What is it? Take your pillow. No. What's wrong with you? Fouad, speak up. I want to go back to Marie's home. We have to get back to our own home for a while. you said we don't live there anymore. Forever. Yeah. But now it's different. Because that man came? No. Because I was naughty yesterday? No. Why does Luci hate you? Because she thinks I want to take her mother away from her. She doesn't like her mother either. Of course she does. Like all kids. Like you.. Didn't you miss your mom? Mom's not home. Do you want to see her? Do you want me to take you to her? No. Why? I'm afraid Of mom? Of that man. Why do you say that Fouad? If he hadn't been there they wouldn't have kept her in the hospital They would have unplugged the wires. Does she die if they unplug the wires? Why don't they do that? Because they don't know if she wants to live with the wires or not She wants to die. How do you know? When someone commits suicide it means that they want to die. Sorry dad. Here it is. The stain. Did his wife work there? A couple of days. Samir asked her to come... for a change of mood. That day C?line had a fight with one of the clients. "C?line" his wife? Yes his wife. She had a fight because the client insisted that her clothes were stained here. But C?line told her that they had been stained before. That's all? Yeah. Then I said we can wash her clothes again and she can take them tomorrow. Then C?line got angry with me and said no one asked you anything. I'm the one who makes the decisions here. She said these clothes were stained before and it has nothing to do with us and then threw them out of the store. And the client called the police. I wanted to get out of the store. Are you an illegal worker here? Yes I am. C?line asked me to stay and tell the police that her clothes were stained before. I didn't know what to do. Then I quietly called Samir to come. When he came he made an apology to the client and accepted paying for the damage caused The client agreed on the condition that C?line make an apology C?line said 'no' and then started fighting with me for calling Samir. When I gathered up my stuff to go, Samir caught my hand and told me to stay and asked his wife to leave. He dismissed her in front of me and that client and I stayed. How many days later did she attempt suicide? About four or five. Can I go? Thank you. That's the way depression is. You kill yourself for nothing. One day before C?line committed suicide I sent her all the love affair emails between Samir and my mother. What are you gonna do now? I'll go to Brussels. That's nonsense You can't stay with your father even for two days. You have to go back to your mother. I can't stand to see someone everyday when I caused his wife to kill herself. I can't look at her kid. Take a seat. Do you want me to help you? I don't want Mom to know Listen. I don't. I told you to take a seat. Sit down. I shouldn't have told you. Listen. You have two choices: you can keep it secret and be in torment forever or tell your Mom everything What's the difference? It may have an impact on her getting married. She won't change her decision. She's pregnant. Imagine if she learns when she has his baby. It's too late then. If I'd wanted I could've told her during the last few months. It doesn't matter what you want You should see if it's important for your mother to know or not She deserves to know. Hi Mom. You ok? Would you open the door for me? Did you get me potato crisps? Yes I did. You're here! I was upstairs with Luci. Are you ok? How was your meeting? What meeting? With Samir's worker. Yeah...not bad. Well? You didn't tell Luci that I was coming? No. So how did she know? Did she know? How? I don't know. Maybe she checks your emails. Where do you put it? Did something happen? Are you in the mood for taking a walk? No I'm tired? What's wrong Ahmad? You want to live with Dad? If you go I'll come with you. You need to stay with Mom. I want to be with you. Don't think about it Dad's wife is strange, isn't she? It's ok. Is he right? Why did you do that to me? Why did you do that to me? What did I do to deserve this? You piece of shit! What did I do to you? Let her go, Marie! Calm down...Calm down Take it easy. Let go of my hand...Let go of my hand Don't do this...Didn't you promise? Get out of this house. Go out for a moment. Leave me alone. She is in a difficult situation herself I asked her to tell you. She could have kept it hidden. Was it better this way? You don't talk. Why are you still here? Get out of this house. Get lost. I don't want to see you anymore. Stop it. Go to your room. Go dear. Keep in mind that it was you who wrote them. She just forwarded them. I don't want to listen to you... Go. I hate it when you make out that you're a good man and want to teach me lessons. I don't want to give you lessons. You told me to come here and talk to Luci. It wasn't for Luci that I asked you to come, It was for those fucking divorce papers Listen After four years.. Listen Why didn't you tell me to come last year? Why did you ask me to come in the middle of this shit? Shame on you. You wanted to get married without telling me. Go check your emails... You didn't you book a hotel? Don't talk rubbish. You made me sleep with his kid in one room. Why? I sent you that email. You brought me here to avenge. Yeah, you're right. You happy now? Then you tell me you're pregnant in court. Why? Don't you want to go? Go for God's sake...Go Just go... She's leaving... Luci, where're you going? Come back Who are you to tell me what to do? Please Luci...Don't make it worse. Why did you tell her? You agreed You made me. I didn't want you to be in torment for the rest of your life. I'm not now? Is everything ok now? Wait... Have you got some money? Hold on...I'll come with you. Hold on... I'll go myself Ahmad Can I ask you something? What? What was in those emails? I don't know. Come back home Ahmad Ahmad...look at me If you stretch it anymore, you're done... Stop You remember me and Mitra? Stop This world can go on without me and you! Sometimes I think if I hadn't gone four years ago... If you hadn't gone four years ago you'd have gone the next year If not one year after...two years after You didn't belong here... What did I tell you the first day? You have to choose to be here or there... You wanna tell him? You can't tell him anything. Go to sleep. Turn the lights off. Is Samir here? Yeah..Upstairs Hello. Hello Fouad You ok? Yes Do you have a minute? Yeah Come in. What are they? Her perfumes. I'm taking them to the hospital for a test. Her nurse said sense of smell is the last to go This one is yours. She liked it. What's up? Nothing Why don't you come in? I have to go. I don't like it when you hide your feelings I'm not hiding anything. It's good news that she reacts to something right? How would you like me to answer you? You're stuck between me and her. Did you come to this conclusion today? No. It's been a long time. When? What do you mean when? Because you didn't speak like this last week. I didn't dare to... Maybe I wasn't sure Sure about what? I feel I'm only going to fill the void left by your wife And whose empty place am I going to fill? No one's You sure? That I'm not compensation for your unrequited love? If it was so, I wouldn't get pregnant. It was unplanned. I could abort it. You kept it to efface his memory. Believe me, that relationship has come to an end You don't believe that. Otherwise you would have let him go to a hotel. You think I don't know why you feel bad? I don't know you anymore. I feel bad because I know why your wife committed suicide. Don't involve her, ok? Your wife knew it. Don't repeat the nonsense that your daughter says. She would've told me at the end, if she had known it. She never asked you anything about me? Like what? I don't know... Why you go out and come back that much? No, you were like the other clients. What about you? Wasn't she suspicious of you? No. I wish she were. I wish she had been worried that I might be with someone or not. I'd have known I was important to her. Luci sent her our emails. How did she get her email address? Your wife gave it to her. Had she met her? Luci called the dry cleaning and told your wife that she had some of our emails that she wanted to send her. And your wife told her to send them. When did she call her? The day before her suicide. Na?ma come here. After that fight when I told my wife to leave here... Yes Did she come in when I wasn't here? No. She didn't pass by when she wanted to go upstairs? I didn't see her the last days Didn't she ever come down? Yeah. Just the last day. How about before? No, why? I've been told that someone called here and talked to my wife. You can go. Hello, madame. - Good day Madame. - Thank you. Bye Can you take over until I get back Samir! Sorry mom. Just don't lie to me again. What did I lie to you about? That you sent those emails. Do you promise me? Ok? Why do you think that I lied to you? Because she wasn't at the dry cleaners the day before her suicide. But I talked to her. No. Yes I did. She had an accent. His wife is French. Hi. Why did you do that? What? Why did you do that? What? Why did you introduce yourself as my wife and give that girl her email address? I'm sorry. I don't want you to say sorry, Just tell me why. Speak up. She didn't like me. She didn't like you? Why? Had you done something? No. So why didn't she like you? She believed there was something between me and you. She believed so? Why? Why did she think so? Because you let me work here without any papers. She was supicious of me. Did she tell you anything? No. So what is this bullshit? I think she always wanted to get rid of me. You think? Out. She never asked me to fire you. But she always... She did things to get you to fire me. Like what? I asked you like what? Many things. Like what? Like what? Sorry Like what? The day that client called the police she wouldn't let me go. She said I had to stay. That doesn't have any relation. She wanted the police to know that I'm not allowed to work here. Just this? That's why she is in coma now? Get lost! I washed, ironed and put in a cover the clothes we had a fight about. Get out. I'm sure there was no stain on them. She did it herself on purpose. I'd been here for one year. No clothes were stained like that before. How much of your payment is left? It's what I do every day There was no stain on those clothes. I swear to God those clothes weren't stained. She did that on purpose. Get lost. Get out. I just wanted her to know that there is nothing between me and you. You were always in a bad mood and thinking about someone else. But she thought it was because of me. That day when you took my hand and didn't let me go. Instead, you booted her out I looked in her eyes I know what she was thinking. You know what you did... mother of an eight-year-old boy in the hospital like a piece of meat. I didn't do anything. You gave that girl her email address. If she had read the emails she would have understood everything. She wouldn't have stood in front of me to drink laundry detergent She would've gone to that pharmacy in front of that woman to do that Or up there in front of you. Why before me? Won't she come here anymore? Who? Na?ma No Why? She did something bad. She said she was sorry. Some things can't be forgiven. Like what? What happened to your finger? Nothing. I want to get back to Lea We can't at the moment Until when? Until your mother's situation becomes clear. - When will it become clear? - I don't know. I get bored here. Why don't you come down with me? I don't like it down here. Hello Hello Go up for a moment Fouad. How are you? Can I go with Marie then? Go and get your stuff. Go. Would you draw something for Mom? Ok. Sit down. You think she read those emails? I don't know. If she had read them... She would've told you something about it. We didn't talk to each other after that fight. She went into a sulk with me. Even if she had read them, you said yesterday She didn't care if there was someone else in your life Was it important? Maybe I don't know... I prefer to talk about the present The past is gone What I know now is that you're pregnant We have to forget it Could we? We have to What if we don't? Is your wrist better? It still hurts a little. Didn't you go to a doctor? Lack of calcium; the baby takes it all. How many months? About three I thought your wrist hurt because of painting. I don't know. Maybe. There's something I want to tell you before I go. About what? When I left... It's not important I wanted to make it clear No. I don't want to talk about the past Forget it. So I'll be going. What about your stuff in the shed? I don't want it Take it. What are you doing? My helicopter got stuck You broke it! No, it's just stuck Can you reach it? Wait...Wait Be careful You're going? Yeah I'm going Bye Fouad Bye Bye Unfortunately she showed no reaction. Nothing? I saw nothing. You mean both times that she clawed at her stomach were involuntary Maybe. This test doesn't help us to know how conscious she is But she had never clawed at her stomach before. I can't tell, maybe it happened when the nurse was trying to move her Their skin is so sensitive. But ... doctor How can I be sure? Through more tests. However, if they're negative there will still be room for doubt In this situation you can never be sure I put the perfumes next to her bed. Excuse me, but did you test all of them? No, just one or two. Bye. If you can smell it C?line, squeeze my finger.
