[soft music] [shuttering noises] [unsettling music] [birds chittering] The night here is calling with possibility, a low, soft, unending moan like distant land whispering over a dark, wide ocean horizon. Do you hear that or is it just me? So they mapped the planet from orbit, measured the mountains, shrunk the Earth with jet engines and telecommunication. They found the places where the rivers are born and already spread strange, exotic diseases to all the last remaining primitive tribes. Where does the explorer go when it's all been explored? [horns honking] Millions of Americans pass each other on the sidewalks of our cities each day. For most, things are routine. They take for granted the right to walk that street, protected by a system of laws that guarantee certain freedoms and that those freedoms won't be taken away without a fair trial, fair treatment, and punishment that fits the crime. This young man is an exception. He was arrested and found out the hard way that the American constitution doesn't fit inside your passport when you make a mistake overseas. His experiences with the laws of another country are almost beyond comprehension. The retelling of his adventures is just a reminder of what can happen. [guitar music] [shrill ringing] Hello? Matias? - Yes. - Hello. I'm here with Maíra who's directing the film with me. Hi, how are you? I'm good. [laughing] - Good. - You're in Brazil, right? - Yes. - Yes. - We're in Saão Paulo. - Saão Paulo. - Yeah. - We're filmmakers and we won this grant to do a film about foreign inmates in Brazilian prisons. So, originally, the film was just about foreigners in general inside prisons, and once we got there, we met Chris. [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [indistinct conversations] [traffic roaring] Approaching right turn on Fifth Avenue. [engine whirring] "To whom it may concern, by way of introduction, my name is David B. Shearwater. I supervise property management at The Martin apartments, a residential apartment complex in Olympia, Washington. Christopher Kirk rented from us from January 2001 to June 2004. I don't get to know all of our tenants, but after a hearing a rumor of his computer talents, I sought him out and hired him for several projects in our buildings. While living here, he organized several community projects. Among these were a community radio station. I know he worked for an environmental consulting firm for many years. He paid his rent on time and there were no complaints. Our community is better off because Christopher Kirk lived and worked here. I can name a dozen people who owe him big favors. The thought of him behind bars seems wrong. Chris has made community service a big part of his life and his release would be an asset for the world. We await his safe return." [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] He's very gullible and innocent, and he really can easily be swayed. He's sort of like Pinocchio. You know, he's like the last innocent guy in the world. He hasn't been corrupted yet. [upbeat music] [indistinct conversations] [indistinct singing] [indistinct shouting] [cheering] There was a guy I met in San Francisco when I was on a trip with Andres. I told him I was about to move to Colombia. "What are you going to do there?" he asked. "I don't know," I said, "but I'm sure it'll be interesting. Let's just point the controls straight at the sun and see what happens." "I fully endorse this plan," he said. "Excellent idea." He understood. He got it. On the other hand, he was drunk and it was about four o'clock in the morning, so maybe that's the only way it makes sense. [indistinct remarks] - We're rolling. - All right. So I guess I should just start with the beginning of the whole story, like with the hippos. It all started with the hippos. In Africa, they say the hippo used to have long, beautiful hair. One day, though, a rabbit got jealous of the hippo's hair and set it on fire. Hippo ran into the river to put out the fire but it was too late. All of hippo's long, beautiful hair was burned off. Hippo was so embarrassed about the loss of his hair, he decided never to leave the river again. And to this day, that's why hippos live in the water. Man, I know just how you feel. [dramatic music] The hippopotamus, an iconic symbol of the continent of Africa. These semi-aquatic creatures roam wild here and nowhere else in the world. At least they didn't until now. This small herd of wild hippos lives thousands of miles from Africa in the South American country of Colombia. How they got here is a crime story. Where they're going is a mystery. I was in my office one day, reading the internet as you do, and I found this article about Pablo Escobar, and Pablo Escobar, when he was alive, he was, according to Forbes Magazine, he was at one time, the eighth richest man in the world. [mellow music] It began decades ago here in what's called the Hacienda Nápoles. Now, it's a ruin, but this was once the fortress and personal playground of one of the world's most famous criminals, Pablo Escobar, ruler of the Medellín drug cartel. After his death, his mansion, his palace he had built, basically fell into ruins. It was looted, stripped of anything valuable, and falling apart. And the only thing that was left of his legacy were the hippos that he'd imported from Africa. He'd built this entire safari park. He had kids come through, drive through for free. And after he was killed, most of the animals were carried off to other zoos or government or they just kind of died, and nobody knew what to do with the hippos because the hippo is a very, big, angry animal. You know, not much you can do with them. So they left the hippos alone, and the climate in this area of Colombia suited the hippos perfectly, and they stayed and they bred. And now there's more and more hippos all the time. And I thought this is a very interesting legacy to leave for one of the richest men in the world, you know, angry hippos terrorizing the farmers of the area. That's all he has left. I thought, "That's a really interesting story." And I thought, "I really want to go down and see the hippos." [baby crying] And then the very next day, I was at home and I got a phone call from an old high school friend. We got to talking and he asked me if we'd heard from one of our mutual friends who was a captain in the Air Force. He said, "Well, have you heard from the captain? Well, you're not gonna believe this. They've got the captain working down at the embassy in Colombia." This is a sign from the universe that I'm meant to go to Colombia. I have to do it now. Right here you should just insert a clip of Pinocchio sort of marching off to school. That's Chris Kirk. That's Goose going to school, you know... I got no strings to hold me down That's him! Your documentary's not gonna be as good as Pinocchio. Pinocchio is the documentary. That's his story. He has Pinocchio's posture even, like that sort of happy but clearly made out of what appears to be wooden sticks. I think his father made him out of wood, right? And he got swallowed by a whale and stuff like that. They both desired to be real. I think that's what's behind everything Goose did. [organ music] [applause] [upbeat music] [whistling] I got off the airplane and my friend worked at the embassy, so he met me at the airport in an armored pickup truck, and the door is, you know, this thick. And we kind of piled in the truck and they had a driver and we're driving through the streets and it's just mayhem everywhere, and I'm thinking, "This is the life, this is great." And we go to his apartment and we drop off my bags, and immediately, we go to meet his girlfriend and her friends at a bar. And as soon as I walk into the bar, I'm walking with the captain, and this girl comes up to me. She's the first Colombian person I meet, and she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. She's half Japanese and half Colombian. Just incredible mixture, very exotic. And she's very, very shy, very timid. She's kind of nervous around me. She won't look at me too much. She doesn't speak English very well, but she always kind of sitting near me. And on the other side of me there's this Colombian girl who's very pretty and she's wearing an American flag bracelet and she speaks excellent English, and she really wants an American boyfriend. And she's really talking to me and all these girls are trying to talk to me. They're kind of competing for my attention, which, you know, again, for a guy like me, it's kind of a new experience. I'm trying to talk to the girl with the American flag bracelet. She speaks English very well, but this exotic Japanese girl named V, we'll call her-- V keeps trying to get my attention and she-- at one point, she knocks my drink in my lap. [indistinct chatter] The next day, we go horseback riding and V is kind of-- we're holding hands and she's kind of, kind of talking to me a lot, and I'm noticing that every time she holds my hand, her hand starts to sweat and she's actually dripping sweat off her hand. She's so nervous around me and so shy. She told me that her father was from Japan and he would send her money for her college and for her apartment, and she was going to school to study economics. Her mother didn't have any money, very poor. She told me the story about how a couple years ago, she had a boyfriend from Japan and she broke up with him after a couple of years, and she started seeing this Colombian guy named John for a couple of years and then they broke up, and now she met me. [indistinct singing] Saturday night, I go out to drink and party and the captain asked me, he goes, "So are you kinda getting with this V girl?" And I said, "Yeah, actually, it seems like I am." And the captain tells me, "Look, man, forget about it." He goes, "I know this girl, I've known her for six months and she's not a party girl like all of her friends. Her friends are all crazy and all that." I said, "Yeah," he goes, "She's not like that. She's very serious and she studies. She doesn't like gringos very much. She knows you're only here for two weeks. She's not gonna have anything to do with you." And I said, "Well, we'll see about that. You know, I'm the man, we'll see." [hippos moaning] He meets some shady characters in Bogota. Seems that Bogota can swallow him. It sure can, it sure can. So this was, I think, a year or two before I got here. He was involved in this... kind of on and off relationship he had with a girl called V. That was over when I met him. -Hmmm. - But... But it was always the underlying reason why he came here. Do you think that we could possibly find this V? I remember once we were someplace and somebody saw her. Um, but I don't think she's in Bogota. I think she's a very smart girl. [low growling] I know, I don't know how to contact her. [beeping] [slow footsteps] [stairs creaking] [indistinct conversations] If I remember correctly, among my things is an Amtek PC tower and it should be set up to run. Just plug it in. If not, I believe there's an 80 gig hard drive in there formatted with Windows XP and it contains all my stuff. Please back up the My Documents folder if you can, as this is the last remaining copy of all that stuff. There should be a Pictures folder under My Documents that has subfolders organized by year and month. [energetic music] [mellow music] Don't believe in dreams you bought. Now what you're looking for is a folder around 2004 or 2005. There should be a really hazy photo of V on the beach. Now that's the perfect photo. You could be in jail Brainwashing you They control Everything that you do Oh, no You could be in jail So she tells me a story of her ex-boyfriend John who was Colombian, and she told me the story why they broke up was that he was crazy with jealousy, always just crazy and she couldn't stand it anymore. And the story of why they finally broke up after two years was that she went to Cancun in Mexico alone. And John, John worked at the airport and John was able to look up her name in the flight computers and he found out where she was going, and he gets cheap flights working at the airport, so John followed her to Cancun, unbeknownst to her. She arrived in Cancun for her very lonely vacation and she was waiting in line at the airport for a taxi, and she started talking to a guy in line waiting for a taxi and it turned out they were going to the same hotel. So the guy said, "Well, why don't we share a taxi?" And she said, "Sure, why not?" They go to the hotel. V goes to check into her room. They tell her that her room is not ready yet and the guy she's with in the taxi comes up. He checks in, his room is ready. So V asks the guy, she says, "Hey, can I use your shower? I just want to freshen up after the trip." The guy says, "Sure, why not?" So she goes up to the room, she's in the shower. The guy's in the room. All of a sudden, there's this furious pounding on the door, this hammering on the door. And the guy opens the door and there's her boyfriend, John. The guy says, "Who are you?" and he's like, "Who are you and where's my girlfriend, where's V?" V comes out of the shower in a towel. "Oh my God, what are you doing here?" "What are you doing here, you fucking whore? You bitch, I can't believe you're with this guy." She's like, "I don't even know this guy! I'm just using his shower!" There's clearly something more to the story than what she's willing to say, but what do I care? I'm only in Colombia for one more week. Whatever she does, it's not my business really. [dramatic music] By the end of this week, I finally went out to get lunch with V, just her and I alone. And she says, "We have to talk." And I said, "Wait, we haven't even had sex yet at this point. You can't pull out the 'We have to talk' line." 'Cause "We have to talk" is never anything good. She says, "Look, Tuesday," two days from now, "Tuesday I have to go to Miami." I said, "Really?" She said, "Yes, I have to go. And I'm going to go to Miami for one week because I have a friend who manages a hotel there and I can go work there for a week and make some money, and then I'm going to New Jersey to see my uncle for a week." And I said, "Well, that sounds like a nice trip, but why do you have to go Tuesday? I'm here for one more week. Can't you go next week?" She goes, "Oh no, it has be--I have to go." But then she says, "Well, but I'll be in Miami for one week and New Jersey for one week, and by that time you'll be back in Seattle," and I said, "Yeah," and she says, "Well, can I come see you in Seattle for a week?" And that's exactly what happened. She came out and spent a week with me and it was an incredible week, it really was. And not just the fact that she's beautiful and all that. Just--it was like being in love for the first time. It's just an amazing kind of passionate experience and it's so exciting, and everything I wanted to do, everything she wanted to do was just fun. We just had a great time together. She just wanted to meet my friends and hang out and see how things were. So I was very excited to meet her actually, because I thought, "Neat," because here's this person who I can't think more highly of-- I mean, I adore him, he's the most enchanting person. You know, I mean, he's so just delightful and engaging, so I thought, "I'm so excited to meet this woman that has captivated his heart, neat!" She kept her sunglasses on as much as she could, so it wasn't easy to kind of read her facial expressions to know what was happening inside, but she was clearly uncomfortable. And I was underwhelmed, like profoundly underwhelmed by her. She seemed very, um, very vain and, um, not genuine. When she went to leave, she said, "Look, what do you think? Are we boyfriend and girlfriend now?" And I said, "Well, I live in Seattle, you live in Colombia. I don't know how this is supposed to work, but I'll tell you what. There's nobody else I'm interested in in Seattle." I said, "I'll try to come down to Colombia as much as I can and I'll try to get you to come up here and we'll see how things go. And just one thing you need to promise me is that just never try to lie to me, never try to play games with me." [intense music] I wish I had open eyes on my back So I could see my life going past Seems when it's good everything goes too fast And when it's gone you can never get it back Trying to take a picture Through a dirty window [high-pitched ringing] [message alert] [keys clicking] [message alert] [keys clicking] [ringing] Uh, good morning. - Good morning. - Morning, Sam. Yeah, I found some pictures of [inaudible], the painting, if you wanted those. - Oh. - Yeah, for sure. Do you have it there with you? Do you have it there with you? Yeah, I'm sending it to you now. Was she really beautiful? Uh, I think so, she was very exotic. Just opening up. [inaudible] [beeping] [atmospheric whirring] [water bubbling] Things just got progressively weirder with all of it. I would routinely get phone calls at, you know, 10, 11 at night from him saying, "I just got off the phone with V, we need to talk." I came down the second week of September and again, we had this great time. And I stayed with her in her apartment and there's pictures of us on the walls everywhere, and, and just a lovely time. I spent a week there and everything was great. There was only, only a few small things that I thought were strange. And one thing was she would always have two cell phones with her, but only one battery. And just at random times throughout the day, she would take the battery out of one cell phone and put it into another cell phone and turn it on. And after a couple days of that, I just got curious. I said, "Well, why do you have two cell phones?" And she said, "Oh, because I only have one battery." And I said, "Why do you only have one battery?" And she said, "Because I have two cell phones." [whirring] [speaking foreign language] [indistinct chatter] [singing in foreign language] And she started telling me stories about some other people that she knew, her friends all over the world. She had Japanese friends who lived in Egypt and lived in Panama and lived here and there, and she knew some American people, and there was really so much of it that I really couldn't keep track of everything she had done. She was going everywhere, doing things all the time. And then the first weekend of December comes and it's her last day of school, and she doesn't call me all day, which was unusual. Usually, she's calling once or twice a day at least and she doesn't call. And I try calling her. Her cell phone is off. I try calling her house, nobody's home. I tried on the internet, she's not on messenger at any point. That's really strange. Saturday comes around, same thing all day. Sunday come around, same thing. She's just-- she's gone, disappeared. Sunday night, I call her house and she answers the phone. She said, "Hello?" I said, "Hey, baby, what are you doing? What's going on?" And she said, "Hello, hello? Hello, hello, hello?" And she hangs up. And I said, I said, "You know, that's, um, that's really stupid." That's basically what I told her months ago, never do that kind of thing with me. So I call back immediately and this time, a guy answers the phone. And so I say in English, kind of pointedly, I say, "Yeah, is V there?" And he says, "Yeah, hang on," in English. And she gets on the phone and she says, "Hello? Hello, hello, hello?" And then she hangs up. So I went and I sent her an email. Basically I said in the email, I said, "Look, you know, I've had a great time with you, but you know, if that's how you answer the phone, I'm never calling you again, that's just stupid. I've told you that's not what-- I cannot have that. Just forget about it." And so a couple of hours later, she reads her email and she calls me and she's just crying and she doesn't understand, what am I saying in this email and what's going on? And I said, "Well, you're playing the game on the-- the 'Hello, hello' game is not gonna work with me. I'm just--I'm not having it." And she says, "But, but, but you know, Christmas is coming up," and I said, "Yeah." And she goes, "Well, I really want to come and spend the holidays with you. Can I come up and stay with you for a month?" I said, "Well, hm." I kind of had to think about that for a second. I thought-- normally during the holidays, I would go back to Michigan and see my family, and you know, that's fine, it's okay. But Michigan, where I'm from, is not especially a nice place really. And I thought, "Well, gee, if my options are I can go back to Michigan for Christmas or I can spend a month having really great sex with this incredible woman, you know, it's not really much of a choice at all." Did I understand her? It took a couple of years before I even thought I understood her even a little. I was baffled by her for a long, long time. That's a large part of what was so intriguing. [atmospheric whirring] [message alert] [keys clicking] [message alert] [keys clicking] [message alert] [message alert] [message alerts] She came running down the hallway and jumped in my arms and it's Christmas Eve. She doesn't have any bags with her, just her carry-on bag just kind of crammed full of clothes and makeup and things. And she says, "Oh look, it's Christmas Eve and I don't have a present for you." And I said, "Don't worry about that." You know, like you'd say, you say, "Oh, you're my present," like you would. And she goes, "No, no, no, I really want to go buy you a gift." And she said, "You know, I have a friend here, the Mexican guy, and look, if you take me to his apartment, drop me off, he can take me shopping, you know, kind of in secret, I can buy you a gift and we'll come right back." And I thought, "That's a great idea." I'm kind of curious who this Mexican guy is, so let's go do that. So we get to the Mexican guy's apartment and the Mexican guy lives in a very bad area of Los Angeles, and we go upstairs to his apartment and he's in his mid 40s maybe, 50s. He's very fat and he has his wife there and they're obviously not rich. And I just thought, "Well, this is clearly not a romantic thing happening here." And she went shopping with him, they went off, and she came back within an hour and she had bought me a shirt and everybody was happy. And so, I asked her, I said, "You know, so how do you know this Mexican guy again?" And she said, "Oh, I took an English class one time in Los Angeles and I met him there." I said, "Well, I thought you told me he was a friend of your aunt's?" She said, "Oh yeah, that too, that too." We spend about another five days in Los Angeles. We went to Disneyland and we had a great time and I'm in the shower in the morning and I can hear her using my cell phone and speaking in Spanish and then Japanese and Spanish again, get out of the shower and V is very excited. And she says, "Hey, guess what? My Mexican friend is having a barbecue today. Can I go?" And I said, "Well, you know, sure, we can go." And she said, "No, no, no. I have to go alone. It's a bunch of Mexicans and, you know, me being with you is a little awkward because they don't really like Americans too much. And I thought, "I should just let her go, drop her off, and maybe I'll see something or pick up a clue and see what happens." Let her go. So, I did, I drove her back to the Mexican guy's apartment and dropped her off. And the Mexican guy was very nice. You know, "I'll see you later." I went back to my car and I kinda sat and watched and a couple minutes later, she comes out, they get into the Mexican guy's car and they drive off and I thought, "I should follow them." And I thought, "No, no, no. You know what, I'm not gonna be that kinda guy, that kinda boyfriend who follows...no. She needs to come to tell me when she's ready. When she feels comfortable, she can tell me what she's doing. I'm not gonna try to play those kinda games." So, I just waited, basically, went out and did some errands, and about an hour and a half later she calls me and she says, "Oh, hi. We're at the casino now. We went shopping and now we're at the casino." And there's a big casino near the Mexican guy's apartment. And I said, "Yeah," and I can hear the machines and bing, bing, bing, bing, the machines. And she said, "Yeah, we're just doing a little gambling and we'll be back in about an hour, two hours, and I'll call you when we get back." And I said, "Okay." And, yeah, sure enough, about an hour and a half later she calls me and she says, "I'm back at the Mexican guy's apartment, please come get me." So, I went there and she was drinking a little bit at the casino and V would always get a little obnoxious when she drank, which is kinda charming in itself. And so, when I arrived, V's there and she has a new jacket and she's got bags of things that she's bought. She's obviously went on a big shopping trip in a very short amount of time. Bought all kinds of things, I don't even know what all, and I said, "Well, this is great, nice jacket, V. That's beautiful. But, where did you get the money for all this?" And she said, "Oh, I had some money saved to go shopping." And I said, "Well, but, you know, you took a bus to Chile because you didn't have the money to fly..." She said, "Oh no, I had money saved for shopping." And I was like, "Okay." And so, why did you have to go shopping into the casino with the Mexican guy and I couldn't come? And just, she wouldn't even answer. She just, you know, kind of obnoxious. Like, "Oh, well you're here now," or something and...okay. Okay, there's my clues right there. That's what I've got to work with. And I really couldn't figure it out. I didn't have any theory whatsoever. Obviously, there's something going on with this girl, but if she was smuggling drugs, if you swallow the drugs, it takes quite a bit of time to get that out of your system. It takes at least several hours, if not a day. Then, her carry-on bag, it was crammed full of her stuff. They had to fly into Los Angeles airport with a carry-on full of drugs, isn't gonna happen in Colombia, especially. I thought, "Well, maybe she's a prostitute or something?" There just wasn't enough time to do anything like that. It just doesn't make any sense at all. I can't...work it out. And I felt like I couldn't really punish her for telling me the truth and I wanted-- Son of a bitch! What's wrong with you? I would hate to see any of my friends talking trash about V because I think she's a complicated, fascinating character and to simply write her off as a crazy bitch leaves us no opportunity to explore all kinds of issues- men, women, fidelity, ethics, equality, economics, politics, culture, drug prohibition, and yeah, subversion and self-destruction. There's a lot to talk about, too much for a film, maybe, but I don't think any of my friends have this kind of take on the story. To be that frustrated for so long and then all of a sudden have this beautiful woman just showering her attention on you is intoxicating and it just... like... if you're thirsty enough, drowning looks really good. [snorting] There's stories and then there's stories. You look for signals like a poker player looking for tells: eyes, body language, speech mannerisms. You watch a person when they're being honest and you watch them in a lie, draw the baseline and compare. There are generalizations, but every person is unique. A liar will avoid direct eye contact. Arm, hand, and leg movement will be constrained, directed inward, covering up. They may turn their body away from you. Touching the ear and nose, the face, throat, and mouth. Nervous tics. You want to catch a liar? You study. [haunting music] [speaking foreign language] Something that I've been thinking is that you were always trying to find her logic and never to find your logic. Yeah. I'd like to hear about your own logic. It's confusing is what it is. And which I really appreciated later on, too, being in Colombia. What I found in Colombia was that everything there was like that. Everything was just confusing. There was nothing that was good or bad, there was always something mixed all together and it was just crazy and I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed trying to figure these kinds of questions out. Who are you really and what are you made of? How far would you go and what would you do? These are questions that you really can't answer if you're just going to the office everyday and working a normal job, mowing the lawn on the weekends. You'll never know. Did you ever go to another country and meet another American when you didn't expect to? You're down in Costa Rica out in the jungle trying to fuck a monkey so you have a story to tell your buddy. [horn honks] [horn honks] [speaking foreign language] I was just bored. I really wanted to go out and travel, see the world and have adventures. And so, to try to meet a nice, normal woman in Seattle and have a good relationship, it just... I'm not ready for that. That's not what I want right now. I want some craziness. And I found exactly what I wanted. I'll try and get out of your way. No problem, I'm waiting, no problem. Come on, Shelby, let's go. Are you...why are you here? She's taking pictures and making a movie, let's go. Chris was not the job kinda guy. That might have been one of the reasons he had a hard time... [distorted audio] back in the States, the idea of going back to get up in the morning, the American lifestyle of work for the man, get up everyday, do your thing, sit at your desk. That's the kinda things we talked about that, you know, we didn't wanna get back into. Work, make somebody else money, buy a house, buy a car, work, go home, watch TV, go to sleep. On the weekends, go play golf. The tranquility is nice. The excitement is good in your youth, but tranquil's nice as you get older and-- I agree. Goose just isn't that old yet. Who has less liberty than the children you make say this? That's the irony; they get the least liberty of anyone. We don't have it; they got dick. They can't do shit. We have the oldest children in the world in this country. We don't let 'em do shit forever. They can't do shit, they can't drink, they can't smoke, they can't drive, they can't vote, they can't work, they can't fuck for God sakes. If you wonder why your teenager's such an asshole, you wonder why he's sitting in a Taco Bell parking lot after the Friday night high school football game, he's keying cars and he's smearing dog shit on your door handles for no particular reason, it's 'cause he's bored out of his tit. This path is well lit. It starts with marriage, then mortgage, parenthood, pensions. I start saying things like, "How was your vacay?" Choose a health plan and watch my waist expand. Really care about local elections. Subscribe to Consumer Reports so I make sure I pick the best leaf blower. Is a clean gutter the best I can hope for? Will I tell outrageous anecdotes about my car insurance and be in bed by 11? Which fabric softener is right for my lifestyle? Maybe I'll start watching TV news, find a political position that best expresses my sublimated feelings of impotence and frustration. Maybe I'll take interest in the love lives of famous people or the statistics of people who throw a ball around a field. I'll worry I'm not getting the best gasoline for my engine or claiming all the right deductions. Did I pay that parking ticket on time? Okay, Honey, try to remember the last place you saw the baby. And maybe all will be cool because with one device, I'll be able to watch movies about people who have interesting lives and then play video games to pretend I'm having an interesting life and it's high fucking definition. And yeah, yeah, I believe I will thank God it's Friday. Oh, sweet candy Jesus, thank you, hallelujah, Friday. Free at last, free at last, at least until Monday. And a weekend becomes a week, becomes a month, becomes a year, becomes, "Whoops, here's your wheelchair," and then it's ringing for the nurse to come roll you over so as to rotate the bedsores. And you try to say, "Hey, wait, I wanted to try things, I wanted to see things, I wanted something else," but too late, Jack. You had options. My dad worked in a factory in Flint. He carried a programmable HP calculator in a belt holster that counted down 24 hours a day to the milliseconds until the exact moment when he'd retire. This is the fear. [clock ticking] [lawnmower puttering] He would be very bored here. He needed other stimulus to keep his mind going. - Wouldn't you... - I would agree. Yeah, this-- Staying in our hometown would not have done him well, I don't think. [clicking] [tapping of computer keys] [guitar music] I'm up all night against my will. There's nothing in religion, science, or philosophy that is anything more than the thing to wear for a time. - Bitch. - Anything at all. The doctor gave me sleeping pills, and I took one. Then I felt all alone. Sleeping like a stone. And, babe... ...you were the light. But, now... ...you are the dark. But I don't have anything to say, so you can shut that off. Shut it off! [static crackling] But, um, it's a little bit creepy, I have to say, especially at night. You're there by yourself and it's totally creepy. I've tried to leave it untouched. Really, we've gotten a lot of attention out of this thing, more than probably it deserves. [clicking] It's very hard to really touch him, to really feel him touched by his own experience. He tells it really well, and he's a great storyteller. But at the same time, you can--like talking to him, interviewing him as we did for, like, I don't know, 16 hours, and he's always talking like that, this kind of distance from himself which is the main character of his story. Hi, Chris. Welcome to my apartment. [indistinct chatter] This is Chris, come on. If you need can come through, come on. Thank you. Hi, Ben. This is now my apartment. Seventy-five square feet of Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil, $2.49. Four thousand square feet of Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil? $132.80. Our number one story on the countdown tonight, victimizing your close friend while he's out of town with a massive Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil practical joke? Priceless. That is exactly what Luke Trerice did to his good friend Chris Kirk using approximately 4,000 square feet of foil to not nearly wrap every inch of Mr. Kirk's Olympia, Washington apartment, but also every one of Mr. Kirk's belongings individually, including his toilet and his toilet paper and his change. Chris Kirk, foiled again, as it were, joins us now. - Good evening, sir. - Hello. So, uh, is this guy, Luke, under a bus somewhere, or are you gonna let him live? No, no, he's okay, he's okay. What on earth was he doing in your apartment, please? Where were you? I was in Los Angeles with my girlfriend for the holidays. And Luke needed a place to stay, and it seemed harmless enough at the time. We're seeing pictures of your apartment. What did they leave unwrapped, please? Not much. My bed, a picture of my girlfriend, and, uh, and a book. Um... Everything else is completely wrapped. My girlfriend left untouched. She'll be pleased when she arrives. [muffled laughing] This is the note left by Luke. Said, "Would it kill you to get a stepladder? P.S. I touched all your stuff." I'm feeling the love, yeah, the bright, shiny, silvery love. Every TV show, CNN, every news organization is calling, every radio show is calling. They just went crazy. And it was kind of a lot to deal with. I'm trying to work as well, being--having been gone for a couple of weeks from work, trying to catch up on that. At the same time, now, remember, I've got this girl, V, down in Los Angeles. And the first night that she stayed there, we talked about it, and we had found kind of a cheap hotel near where the Mexican guy lived, oddly enough, and it was kind of a cool place, and I told her, I said, "Well, you know, you should probably stay there. It's cheap and all that and, obviously, you have enough money to support yourself here. I don't know." And she said, "Yeah, I will, actually," and so... So, the next morning, um, I called that hotel and I said--I was asking for her name, and the front desk clerk said, "No, there's nobody here under that name." I said, "Oh, okay, didn't think so." And then a few hours later, V calls me, and we're talking, and she's saying, "Oh, I went shopping and I did this and that," and I said, "That's great. So where did you stay last night?" She said, "Oh, I stayed at that one hotel that was cheap and cool." And I said, "Well, that's funny, because I tried to call you this morning there and they said you weren't there. You weren't a guest there." And she said, "Oh, well, I checked out really early this morning." [intense music] [clicking] I work in computers, it's what I do. And many times, people will come to me and they'll want me to hack into somebody's e-mail or spy on their wife or something, and I always tell them, "No, it's a bad idea." [blipping] Ethically, us nerds, privacy is a big deal. And furthermore, I've always felt like if you're coming to me, asking me to help you spy on your partner, that it doesn't matter what's in your partner's e-mail because your relationship is already pretty messed up, because you've just come to ask me to spy on them. So your partner can't trust you. And if you're asking me to spy on them, then you can't trust your partner. And when it's gone, you can never get it back. But I thought, "In this case, this might be justified." So what I decided to do is I put what's called a "key logger" on my computers in my apartment. So, now, when I'm gone to work, she's there, if she uses the internet, I'm gonna see everything that she does on the internet. Why was I so obsessively trying to figure all this stuff out? I don't know. He had a fever. He was on fire. He was... He couldn't stop thinking about her. And, now, I can see everything she types, so now I can see what her e-mail password is. And her e-mail password is "mentir," which is the Spanish verb meaning "to lie." We were going through all my books, and we were unwrapping the books. And V loved books as well, so she really enjoyed that. And I pointed to an entire shelf I had of books, and I said, "Look, see the shelf. This shelf contains nearly every book ever published in English about con artists and con games. It's kind of a hobby of mine." Every book individually wrapped. I've read all these books. I said, um, "If you think that you're a better trickster than any of these stories I've read, I can tell you you're wrong." Cool Tricks for Dear Friends. Goose had an ongoing fascination with con men and grifters and that sort of thing. He could talk for hours, actually, about different scams that he'd read about and the way that con men and grifters work. He was fascinated by that sort of... ...play with people's expectations and just kind of with-- I don't want to call it "manipulation" necessarily, but he was fascinated by getting people to do things without them realizing that they were doing what you wanted. If you want to, I can help you become a better liar. I will even do that for you, but you have to let me in on the inside. So I went into her e-mail and looked, and there was a lot of interesting things there. Actually, there was a bunch of e-mails from her Colombian boyfriend, John. So I sent that guy an e-mail, and I didn't say anything more, I just said, I said, "Look, here's my phone number. You might want to call me. We may have a mutual interest in Colombia." [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [tapping of computer keys] John tells me the story about Cancun. He says, you know, "She told me she was going to Cancun alone, and I got suspicious, and so I followed her there and I found out where she was staying." And he said, "I was waiting outside the hotel, just waiting to see if I'd see her. And she came out with some guy, some old guy, and I tried to yell to them, and they just got into a cab and drove away, and then I never saw them again. So I spent the whole week in Cancun just getting drunk." Looking for her, never found her. [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] Then John says, "Well, I have the phone number of this guy named Isaac who lives in Virginia that she knows." And I call this guy's number, and I say, "Hi, is this Isaac," and he says, "Yeah." "I'm one of V's boyfriends. There's several of us. And I'm not like an angry, jealous boyfriend or anything. Listen, V has been telling me that she really loves me and she wants me to quit my job and move to Colombia and live with her, and I really want to do this, it sounds like a lot of fun. But, um, you know, obviously, there's a lot more going on with this girl than I know about. I'm just hoping maybe you have some insight here, and maybe you can help me out, just kind of man to man, gringo to gringo, just help me out here. What's going on with this girl? What's she all about? I don't understand." [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [tapping of computer keys] "You seem like an okay guy, and I'll help you out. Do you know who I am?" And I said, "Well, V's mentioned you a little bit. I don't really know, no." He said, "Well, do you know how old I am?" [tapping of computer keys] [blip] So he told me the story, he said, "So a couple of years ago," he said, "I was going to Aruba for a vacation, and I was waiting in line for a taxi at the airport." And I said, "Wait, this story sounds familiar." He said, "Yeah, I was waiting in line for a taxi, and V and her friend, May, were standing right behind me, and it turned out we were going the same way, so I invited the girls to share the taxi. Then, when we got near my hotel, I invited the girls up for a drink and, uh, well, then, you know, you work it like you do." [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] And Isaac says, "I was laying in the bed just watching TV. V was in the shower. And, suddenly, there was this furious pounding on the door, hammering on the door, and of course, I didn't get up to answer it. I just picked up the phone and called the front desk and said, 'Why is there somebody knocking on my door?' The front desk said, 'We don't know, sir, but we'll look into it.'" And as far as Isaac was concerned, that was the end of it. And a couple hours later, he says, "A couple hours later, me and V are leaving the hotel, we're going to go eat and, suddenly, this guy comes running up from out of nowhere. The guy comes running up and he's screaming. He's saying, 'Hey, hey, hey! That's my girlfriend, that's my girlfriend!'" And Isaac just turns to him and says, "Buddy, you got problems," and V gets a taxi, and they jump into the taxi, they drive away. And V is kind of stressed out, and she says, "Oh, that was my-- that was my crazy brother who just escaped from the mental hospital." And Isaac said, "Sure, honey, whatever. Let's go buy you something nice." [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] "Did you think that V was working as a prostitute?" And Isaac says, "Well, that's really--no, no, but V would never ask for money directly, but she obviously knows how to use what she has to get the things that she wants." And I said, "Oh, you know, Isaac, so much is starting to come together now. This is making more sense." And I said, "Oh, wait," said, "Wait, wait. You were the guy in Miami last June." He said, "Yeah, yeah, that was me last June." Uh, he says, "Wait," he goes, "You're Chris from Seattle." And I said, "Yeah," and he says, "Oh, yeah. Last June, V was talking about you and she was so excited to go see you." And he says, "Actually, I paid for that flight for her to go to Seattle to see you. Hope you enjoyed." I said, "Yeah, I did. Thank you, I think, you know?" [tapping of computer keys] [tapping of computer keys] And Isaac says, he says, "Well, I can't tell you what you should do, um, but I can tell you this: It doesn't matter if V gets a job and makes her own money, gets rich. It doesn't matter if she has a boyfriend. It doesn't matter if she gets married and has children. None of that will matter ever. I can tell you, this girl will always call me." Then there were all the e-mails from the Japanese guy. She's e-mailing the Japanese guy and she's telling him, "Hi, how are you doing? I'm traveling in the United States alone on a bus. And, no, I don't know where I'm going to be staying, so you can't call me." And so the Japanese guy is e-mailing back to her and he's saying, "I don't believe any of this. You're such a lying bitch. What are you really doing? Where'd you get the money for this trip? You're--this is ridiculous." And she's e-mailing back to him, saying, "No, it's really true, I swear, I promise, and I really love you so much, and I hope we get married this year." [blip] [tapping of computer keys] [blip] [music starting] And she got angry. She said, uh, "I've only been with you since I met you last April or May. There's nobody else in my life I'm interested in. It's only you, it's only you, and, you know, you're kind of an asshole for even bringing this up." And I said, "Great. The airport is somewhere over that way. Just look for the airplanes that are coming in and landing. You'll find it eventually. Just start walking." I said, "Just get the fuck out of here. I'm going to bed, you're not. You know, see you later, fuck off." And... And she started crying immediately. She said, "My God, I don't understand. What's going on? Why are you doing this? What? What do you mean?" And I said, "Oh, oh, you want to know what I mean? You want to know why? I'll tell you why. I'll tell ya. Listen, I've read all your e-mails. I know. I know about the guy in Peru who would be really jealous if you were going to the States to be with your boyfriend. Um, I know who's in Tucson, Arizona. I know his name. And it's really rude of you to not even answer him back. He invited you to go to the States. You didn't even answer, very rude." I said, "I know about John who's not really your ex-boyfriend so much, is he? You know, you just kind of play with him a lot and go back to him. I know about the Japanese guy. Oh, you know, you want to marry him this year. You know, have you even thought about how that's gonna work? I'm gonna come down and live with you, and he comes to Colombia to marry you? Have you even thought about this, you stupid fucking bitch? What is wrong with you? What's gonna happen? What is gonna happen when he comes to Colombia to marry you?" And she's crying, and then she says, "No, no, no. No, please, look." She said, "Just wait, wait, wait. The Japanese guy, it's that you just don't understand Spanish very well. I was telling him how much I love you and I want to marry you." And in that moment she said it, and all that anger, just the pure rage that I had building, all that anger just evaporated, it just went "poof." I just went, "Oh my God." [exploding] Fireworks are so much better when they're exploding directly overhead, low, in the middle of the city where the explosions hit you in the chest like an unexpected divorce and rain fire and shrapnel on your head. The booms echo and amplify off the buildings, somehow not shattering glass. Down close where the launchers are, just a few yards away, close enough that even a minor malfunction could light off your own personal Armageddon. That's where it's best, and that's where you'll find me, trying to brush the napalm off my dome. You've never truly seen fireworks until you've seen them streaming straight the fuck down at ya. [popping] I'm feeling great. I'm driving in the car and I'm practically whistling to myself. I'm ready to put some closure to this story. It's over, you know, phew. What an experience. And V, she's sitting in her chair in the seat of the car, and she's just slumped in her seat and everything about her had changed, like, her face had changed. The way she carried herself had changed. Her voice changed, the way she spoke, everything. Like a completely different person. She would just sit there and just be very, very quiet. It was the quietest drive of my life, I think, just not saying anything. And I finally stopped for some coffee and I parked the car. And then, very quietly, V says, she says, "Look, um, everything you said last night was true. All those e-mails, yes, it was all true. And there's that guy in Peru I met just a couple nights. He wasn't anybody important. And, yeah, there's that American guy who lives in Tucson, Arizona, and I met him in a bar, we went out a few times, but it's nothing important. And, yes, I still see John, my Colombian boyfriend. But I don't really have any respect for him and I don't really like him that much. But he's always there. No matter what I do, every time I call him, he comes back to me always. So if I'm lonely, if I feel bad, you know, I can always call him. And then there's the Japanese guy, you know, I really loved him and I thought I might want to marry him. But since I met you, I really love you and I really want to try to make this work with you, and I'm so sorry for everything I've done and all this crap. I just--I really want to try to make this work. Please, can you give me just a chance to make it work?" I thought, "Shit. Oh, God. Oh, Christ." You know, like now, um... What--what can you do? She's just told me exactly what I wanted to hear all this time. That's all I wanted to hear from her. Now she's given this to me, and I felt like I couldn't really punish her for telling me the truth. And I wanted... I still--God. I'm really thinking, I'm really thinking, "No, this girl is-- she's just crazy. There's something really wrong with her." I'm thinking, "And this isn't gonna work." But I thought, "Well, maybe there's that one percent chance that maybe this could actually work," you know? And even if it's just one percent, it's worth it, you know? It isn't--isn't that kind of-- that kind of passion, that kind of love. Certainly something I've never experienced in my life before like that. And if there's that one percent chance that it could work out, then it's worth it, it's worth a shot, you know, why not? I don't have anything more to actually lose at this point, right? [plane whooshing] [car whooshing] [engine puttering] [indistinct chatter] I lived with her for a couple of months and it just went haywire, it went crazy. I had to move out. And when I moved out from her place, I just said, "No, I cannot see you anymore at all. Please don't call me. I'm not gonna answer your e-mails. And I cannot see you. That's it, there's no way." [engine whirring] I put in some quality drinking time after that and I found other people who knew V: Americans, Puerto Ricans, people who worked for the DEA. They said she had a connection in Chile who could put a suitcase with cocaine on an airplane, and if she was going to the right place, like Los Angeles, they had somebody there, like the Mexican guy, who worked as a baggage handler at the airport. He could pull the bag with cocaine off the airplane and no one would know it was ever there. I remember V's passport completely full of stamps. V was on the move all the time, all over the world. How many of those points on the map were for love, or money, or drugs, or all of those things at the same time? Ten months. Hard to believe it's been ten months, although it's actually been a year with two months of hard time tacked on. There is no doubt there was no other option. It was the right thing to do. Ten months and I hardly thought about her. Early on, when she called, I just let the phone ring. When she called from a phone number I didn't recognize, I refused to talk to her. When she asked where I was, I said I wouldn't tell her that. When she asked if I was okay, I said I wouldn't tell her that. When she asked if I wanted to talk to her, I said "no" and hung up often, every day, every week. For how long? I didn't pay attention. When she called on her birthday, she said, "It's my birthday," and I said, "Uh-huh." She said, "Wish me happy birthday," and I said, "Fine, happy birthday. Now I got to go. My ice cream is melting." It was the right thing to do. When she e-mailed and said, "I'm not doing well, please just talk to me, tell me you're all right," I ignored her. When she said she'd spent three days in the hospital for depression after I left, and you'd have to be pretty damn far gone in Colombia to score that, I thought, "Well, there you go, you crazy bitch. You knew it was coming for months and did nothing to stop it while I tried everything. What did you think would happen?" A week would go by, two weeks. She never crossed my mind. [eerie music] [telephone ringing] [computer beeping] Colombia is a very enticing kind of place. You know, if you have a vice, it can deliver your vice, whatever, gambling, women, drugs, all that stuff. And I had all the vices. I think he was a different person in Olympia than the Chris I know here, 'cause their stories are probably like computer geek Star Trek stories, and our stories are, you know, bordellos and rumba and, you know, Pelaya. We lived in this big house for a while. The landlord was an Englishman. He bought this old colonial house and wanted people to live in it, and there was a group living there at the time. In the beginning, there was like six people, and the guy was leaving the country. For some reason, he picked Chris to be in charge to collect the rent and give it to him. Uh, I didn't find this out till later, but the guy... [no audio] 'cause Chris was collecting the rent from everybody and spending it, you know, he never gave it to the guy. Why was Chris the one that, you know, he picked? And that's 'cause Chris has that face. Chris, I mean, you can't help but like the guy. And people were giving more money or, you know, let him stay in their hotels. I mean, there's a property, a list of hotels that Chris owes a significant amount of money to. People would tell me, "Yeah, Chris owes me this much money for this business we started. I bought him a laptop and he disappears." But I was his best friend and I didn't really know everything he was up to. You know, but he came up to me and he approached me with a proposal to make money. Why he did it, you know, how many times he did it, I don't know, but I mean, I know why. It's--the goal was to go back to the States. I could imagine Chris doing anything. [guitar music] Chris was the kind of guy that would wake up at 3:00 in the afternoon and stay up till 9:00 in the morning, you know. He's a very nocturnal guy. He really didn't like the mornings. Yeah, I'm trying to understand this side of Chris that you cannot see when you look to his face, you know? I know Chris. People, you know, Chris is what I would call a "dark horse." He's the one in the film that you'd be surprised is the murderer, you know, in a movie. He's the one you would never expect to do the bad things. Chris is hardcore, I know Chris. Chris is capable of anything, you know. I mean, he might have not been before he got here, but living in downtown Bogotá for five years, you have to, you know, just become tougher to deal with these things that you see every day. I'm really looking forward to seeing this film and find out what kind of guy, what kind of life he lived in Olympia. Bogotá is no Olympia. I've never been to Olympia, but I'm pretty sure they're really different. Later, she asks me, "So why did you choose to come to Colombia?" I start to give my stock answer, some blah-de-blah nonsense that placates the cab drivers. She stops me. "Three words," she says. "Give me three words why." I say, "Well, I'll have to think about that." But then she gives me the first word: "nearer." [indistinct radio chatter] [plane whooshing] [chatter continues] [tapping of computer keys] [soft music] Oh, it's Thanksgiving. I can't come. You have the key? Mm-hm. This isn't Los Angeles. Look at that one right there. Very yellow. All the trees are yellow. Look at that one, that's so pretty. Over there, in the corner. So pretty, like in a movie. I told V once after we first met no matter what happens between us, I'd really like to know what happens to her in five years. And five years after we met, I found out she finally met the right man. He was married with children, but he divorced his wife to marry V, take her to live in Canada happily ever after. I got an e-mail from him a few years later. He said she was going to school, working a few part-time jobs, improving her English. He said she was doing fine, pretty much normal, and they were 89% happy. Eighty-nine percent. So, in a weird way, V and I sort of traded places. She went on to a regular, peaceful life in the suburbs, and I, well, I went the other way. Oof, where was I going next with that? [indistinct chatter] [birds chirping] [snorting] [bubbling] [snorting] [snorting, grunting] [snapping] Okay, I'm here at the Bar do Arante in Florianópolis, Brazil. Take a look around, now this place is famous because people who come here, they write little notes and they hang them on the walls and ceiling. Take a look around here. [uplifting music] Pretty cool place. Now, of course, I need to leave a note. In less than 24 hours, I will be crossing the border into Uruguay wherein I will officially be an international fugitive from justice. So, keeping with that spirit, I think it's only fair that I leave a message on the walls here like this. Wanted: bald, goofy, nasty reddish goatee. Yeah, that's me. I'm gonna leave it right over here. You can see right in the little space there, probably the best seat in the house, right at eye level. Wanted. [music stopping] [wipers thumping] [rain pouring] [thumping continues] Oh, Christopher Kirk, welcome back. [laughing] Really? And what's the first thing you did when you got back? Oh, man, ate. I just ate. Tell me it was something awful like McDonald's. No, I went to Denny's 'cause it was the worst thing I could think of. - Yeah, that's right up there. I'm in Vegas, I'm staying at the Hooters Hotel. Like, it's the most American thing. [laughing] You don't know what you got till it's gone. [jazz music] We're glad to have you back, sir. -Thanks. - We're gonna fucking break. Thanks for listening to this untitled shit we record. Hopefully, this will be the first one we put out. Ghost Kirk. ...saving my love for you. Mm, like Jack Horner in the corner. [indistinct chatter] I went to bed a little bit, a little bit tipsy, and slept very, very soundly. And, then, I was disturbed by something early in the morning, and it was--it was my wife trying to sneak Goose into my bed. - What? She was trying to sneak him into bed with me so that he could wake up. He was wearing footie pajamas with the little booties on them all the way up, all zipped up, all the way up, and he laid there and said, "I had the strangest dream I was in South America." [static crackling] [sustained dramatic tone] [slamming] You can talk about your farms and your Chinaman's charms, talk about your silver and your gold, but the cowboy's life is a very dreary life, it's riding through the heat and the cold. Early every morning, you'll hear the boss say, "Get up, it's the breaking of the day." It's now for to rise with your little sleepy eyes and the bright dreamy night's passed away. You can talk about your farms and your Chinaman's charms, talk about your silver and your gold, but the cowboy's life is a very dreary life, it's riding through the heat and the cold. When springtime comes, double hardships begun. The rain, it's so fresh and so cold. We almost freeze from the water on our clothes, and the cattle you can scarcely hold. You can talk about your farms and your Chinaman's charms, talk about your silver and gold, but the cowboy's life is a very dreary life, it's riding through the heat and the cold. Gentlemen, take my advice, setting out for to roam, but you better stay at home with your kind and your loving little wife.
