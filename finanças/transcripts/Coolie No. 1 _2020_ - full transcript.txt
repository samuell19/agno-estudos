You know what kind of son-in-law I am looking for. A son-in-law who charters an airplane to buy groceries . If a country wants to borrow money, they should ask him. I want a stinking rich son-in-law for my daughter. And you brought me these stinking cheese rolls! Goddamn. - Goddamn! - That was pretty humiliating. Come on, son. Let's go. - Rude. Very Rude. - Listen... I never imagined humiliation can be pretty, man. Jeffery, you have two daughters. This is not the way to behave. Do I wait until I've a third daughter?

Why don't you hire another coolie, sir? Money doesn't come easy. Take it. No, sir. Uncle, are you alright? Raju... Sir, this is not the way. This is what I am paying him for... ...so he must carry all the luggage. If you're feeling so sympathetic, then you carry it Unbelievable, sir. I am being polite while you're being so disrespectful. If you see the real me you'll be humiliated Get lost coolie! Hey...! Listen, you piece of a mozzarella stick. You don't know but I can see the future. I am an astronaut. That's astrologer, you idiot. That's right. Because I can see in one minute you'll be carrying your own bags. Because I am highly trained to train those who think that they are trained. Whether they are in front of the train or behind the train. Because I fight off the train, by the train, for the train. See...train. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Move. Move. Wait. Beat him. Raju, beat him. Drugs. Meow-Meow... You were carrying drugs. Drugs is an addiction that spares no one. Today it's him, tomorrow someone else. Now it's your turn. Bravo, sir. "Drugs on a roll..."

She's my wife. I'll beg-borrow for her. Why do you care? See...he's already admitting he's a beggar. Keep it back! I feel like giving you a good whack. Who are you calling a beggar? You. Who do you think you are some emperor? Get lost. Go to the station and carry luggage. I'll do just that. I am a coolie. But everyone today is a coolie. Everyone's carrying a burden on their shoulder. Whether it's his sorrows, debt, or just life. And you... You're a burden on this earth. Burden? Shalini, listen. I like you, but your father's scrooge.

Why are you stuck on the bungalow like a broken record? We'll definitely go... In a week, month, year...decade. - Come here. - No! First, promise me. We'll go to Mumbai tomorrow and stay in the bungalow. Fine, we'll go...live in the bungalow. What a nice bungalow. Husband... I meant Husband.

But...if her uncle cries next, I won't listen to anyone. I will stay right here. Why is he laughing? He will go with you. Stay with you for a month. That's our tradition. What kind of tradition is this? - Pinto. - Yes, brother-in-law. You're going to a mansion now. Take good care. And there will be a couple of dozen servants. Don't be rude to anyone.

You are not the law, dad. And according to the law all this... This is mine! And I'll sue you for it if I have to. Pandit, that boy's a rascal. I got him arrested. - What? - Now he's suing his father. Wait a minute. Then you should sue your father too. But I don't have a father to sue. That guy up there. I can't sue him.

But I'll take this bungalow from you. I'll see...how you take this bungalow from me? I will take it from him. I'll show him that I am his blood. If he thinks he's bad, I am his dad. Calm down, Prince, calm down. What calm down? My father's denying to accept Sarah as my wife. He means refusing. He won't find a cute daughter like her anywhere. I can tolerate anything but not Sarah's insult. I'll do anything. I'll be a coolie. Coolie. "The burden of the world on my head..." - I'll sleep at the railway station. - No, sir. You know why?

"Sweetheart...don't steal my heart." "Sweetheart...don't steal my heart." Daddy. Yeah. What's wrong? Anju's having a headache since morning. She's vomiting. Taking pills. The doctor's checking her. Let's see what's wrong. Congratulations, Jeffery. Anju's pregnant. You're going to be a grandpa. - How? - Grandpa? But she was fine till last night. This is Raju's doing. Serves you right for sending him with Anju all the time. See the result. Look, he's my brother. He can never do such a thing. What do you mean? It's all his fault. And the doctor just checked Anju. - And not some Manju or Ranju. - Daddy. Mummy, now what to do? Like a responsible father... ...you got to meet the boy's father and discuss this. I see... I hope he agrees. He will have to agree. You know why? Mummy, the biggest joy for any father... ...is when he becomes a grandpa. Grandpa! Heaven on the docks, man. I'll meet his father with sweets in the box, man. Hey Deepak... What? You killed my vibe Now I'll go and vanquish your tribe - Back to work all of you. - When did you and Anju do it? Tell me. Raju, what's wrong with you? Why are you talking like this? Shit. I've lost my mind playing double roles. Doesn't matter. It happens. Don't change the topic. When did you do it? When you would meet Sarah, I would go to meet Anju. It's alright. Sip some tea. You know what, put some poison in this tea for me. Why? I would rather die than live a life like this. Then die. How dare you say that for a friend. I am saying this because I am a friend. You will have to die. Not Kunwar Rajpratap Singh. But Raju Coolie. Sir... Have a sweet. Have a sweet. Singing Goan Song Singing Goan Song Singing Goan Song Singing Goan Song Singing Goan Song Who are you? First sweet, then congratulation, then introductions. - Have a sweet. - Sweet? What for? I am going to be a granddad. Granddad. But who are you? You are going to be the grandpa of my grandson. You. Meaning your son and my daughter. Ohh... So my son's been seeing your daughter. I know greedy people like you too well! But I will not let this happen! No! The lives of both my daughters are at stake! And you will not let this happen! Mind you, I'll sue you! How dare you speak to me like this! Guards. Throw this man out. Throw him out. No one has ever humiliated Jeffery Rozario like this. I am keeping my cool because of my daughters. Otherwise, come to Goa. I'll show you...I'm the bloody king over there. King. Leave me. Leave me. If you can't raise your kids then why have them? One is begging on the streets and the other is working as a coolie. - Another son? - Yes, another son. - Are you the manager? - Yes. What manager? Don't you know he has twin sons? What? Tell him how his twins are making him proud. Tell him if he interferes in my matters... ...then I'll bring this mansion to the ground. Coolie's dad...yuck! Coolie's dad...yuck! Stop spitting. Coolie's dad...yuck! - Mahesh, I've good news for you. - What? Remember Raju Coolie. How can I forget him? He's the reason I lost this wealth and bungalow. The time's come, you'll get your revenge and the bungalow. But don't forget my commission. What are you doing? Come on. I gave you the idea to kill Raju Coolie, but what story are we going to tell. Raju took Rozario's car to the hills. Drunk. Fine, drunk. And then it happened exactly as we feared. What? Diving into a ravine, Raju Coolie goes up into the skyline. Come on. Coolie no. 1. Goodbye. Don't look too happy. I am not dying really. - Heave - Ho... - Heave - Ho... - Heave - Ho... Raju Coolie. Goodbye. Raju. Raju, my shirt's stuck. - Deepak. - Your friend's dying, Raju. Your friend's dying, Raju. - Raju... - Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt. Raju... Found it. Found it, sir. Sir... Sir... We found it. Where is Raju? Don't know. Did he run... ...or did he sink? Raj. You have to be strong, Raj. Sarah, he was strong and I was weak. He wrote the exams but I would pass. He would send his passport, and I would get the visa. He would lift luggage at the railway station... ...but he didn't burden anyone with his corpse. No! I feel my brother's going to say... "Bro, don't cry. Don't cry, bro." Hey... "Don't cry, bro." Huh? My brother spoke. - He spoke to me. - No, Raj. Please. Hey, bro, don't cry. I want to say something before I go. The person responsible for my death is Rozario. Daddy? Everyone nowadays has Jio. But in my life there was Rozario. No! And before I go I will say that Anju is a sweet girl. Before I go I want to request you all to get her married to the person she likes. A guy that would be the light (Deepak) in her life. Deepak. I am going, bro. No, bro... I am going, bro. No, bro... See you, bro. No, bro... Bye, bro. You cannot do this to me, bro. No. - Raj. - No. No. Raj. Raj. Sir. Young master, good morning. Why do you look stunned? He's your manager. - Manager. - Yes... The master, your father, has called you right now. He was in tears and saying that I lost one son... ...and I don't want to lose the other one. So...he's called you over right now to solve all differences. Please, come. I won't go. Raj. Are you mad? - I won't go. - Raj. - He's your father, son. He's calling you. - Forget the tea. Go on. Raj, let's go. He must be shattered after hearing this news. Yes. For god's sake Raj, you should be with him. - Go on. - Come on, go. Be careful with him. Or else he'll run away. Don't worry, I will take care. Sir, whatever I did was the sake of my love. I am a poor man. If my wife finds out... Sir is waiting for you, Raju. He's in his room upstairs. Just go and apologise. Okay, I'll beg for his forgiveness. You take care of the rest. All the best. Sir... Sir... Sir, I am Raju. I know what I did was wrong. But please don't put me in jail. Or my wife will leave me, sir. I am just a coolie. I work at Mumbai Central. Sir... Anybody there!

Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. - But why, I am walking with you, papa. ?? - Rozario. Where is your son-in-law? The guy that comes to the Police station and files his own missing complaint. I don't understand a thing. Have you ever seen them together? One leaves and the other shows up. Other leaves and the first one shows up. Do you know what his biggest crime is? What? He tried to kill Mahendra Pratap. Inspector, what rubbish? Who tries to kill his father? Mahendra Pratap doesn't know him. What father? - Mahendra Pratap Singh is... - Not his father. - And he's... - Not his son. Then who is he? He's just a coolie, just a coolie, just a coolie.
