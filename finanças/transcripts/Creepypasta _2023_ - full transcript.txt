Do you know what a Creepypasta is? Here's the short answer. It's a scary story shared on the Internet. But they're much more than that. I could tell you why... but I'd rather show you. Local and state police are still investigating a possible connection between multiple disappearances in the same neighborhood, beginning last week with a 14 year old girl whose name has not yet been released to the public. The teenager was revealed to be the author of popular online horror stories known as "Creepypasta." Detectives believe the clue to her disappearance could be found in her most recent story, which apparently remains unfinished. Her stories disappeared from her laptop the night she went missing. But thousands of people have already copied them all over the Web. We each have a story within us. Stories that tell us who we are. Not all of them have a happy ending. Hello? Anybody here? Sometimes it's hard to tell which story is yours. You may never know... ...until it's too late. We hear them when we're kids. Stories from our nightmares. Tales of the Boogeyman. Emma, what the hell are you doing? Wasn't me. Oh, was it your little fake friend "Jumby?" Shut up. He's not fake. You're such a baby. Everyone knows you're making him up. Besides, we're on the second floor. Nobody's out there. You ruined our game! Nobody is out there. You ruined our game! Go to sleep or I'll tell, and you can forget about your little game with rocks and dirt. You know they'll send you away to a mental hospital? Strap you down and fry your brain. He wouldn't let that happen. He's not real, stupid! Go to sleep or I'll tell Mom. You're mean. I can't believe I still have to share a room with you. Emma? Quit playing. Emma? Honest, see I told you he was real! Holy crap! Come down, Jumby wants to meet you. Get away from him. We're building a house. You can have your own room! Come inside. You're not safe out there. What are you so afraid of? He's my friend. He's not going to do anything! Emma! Emma! Emma! Put my sister down! Emma! Emma, Emma! Police are looking into the disappearance of Emily Hall. She went missing from her home. Although half the security system was not triggered. Emily was in her second floor bedroom with her sister Anna. Anna, still in a state of shock, keeps muttering the word: "Jumby." The Boogeyman doesn't go away when you get older. he just waits until the right moment to come back. May I have A glass of water, please? I'M THIRSTY! The characters in my stories never know what's going to happen to them, but sometimes they get a glimpse of the truth. So the FDA allows one rodent hair for 100 grams of peanut butter. Eww! Ohh, that is gross! Okay. Okay. I got one. If you go swimming in a lake, there's a possibility that you could inhale an amoeba and it will literally eat your brain. True, I watched a documentary about it. Boom. But what is the likelihood? Big enough not to go swimming in lakes. That's why I only swim in the ocean. Okay, calm down, West Side. All right, I got one. Did you know that raccoons can fit into a hole four inches wide? Go on... Your rectum can stretch up to nine inches in diameter. So theoretically, you could fit a raccoon in your butt. Oh ,Girl! Ahh, and here I was, just using gerbils like a casual. You guys are disgusting. All right, just away from the gross stuff. Here's one. You know how sometimes you think you can see something out of the corner of your eye and you look at it and it's not there. That's because your vision is far more acute in your peripherals than it is when looking straight on. So when you see something... it might actually be there. And how is that weird? It's called the "Shadow Person" theory. I've actually heard of this. They say that what you're seeing are interdimensional beings. Shadow People. They're stuck in between two worlds, just waiting to get in. Mmm hmm. So whatever you do, don't acknowledge their presence. It could be an invitation into our world. Oh, come on! Better safe than sorry. That's ridiculous. We had to have acute vision in our peripherals. It's an evolutionary holdover. Lions were stalking us. Party pooper. Yeah. There's another world that sometimes brushes up against ours. That's where my stories come from. That other reality with a different set of rules. Fuck off... C'mon, dude! Come on! Hello? Do not scream. Who is this? Do... not... scream. What does that mean? Do... not... scream! DO... NOT... SCREAM! DO! NOT! SCREAM! Jesus Christ! Oh, God damn! Fuck, no! AHH! Sometimes I don't know the rules either. So I make up my own. It's more fun that way. Does this make you happy? The ones on the other side don't always wait for an invitation. Sometimes they have help. No! Get off! Hello? Does this body suit you, my love? Is this what you want? The others have been here all along. This is a good one. They're probably watching you right now. To know The Grey Man is to never forget him. Once he enters your mind he's the thought that plays over and over, pulling you under to places so dense and dark that... ...it doesn't matter who you are, who you wanted to be, and that's how he breaks you. Memories of razor blades slashing Who could that be? Razors slashing her face -- Huh. No. Who the hell is there? Writing. At least trying to. You're not real. You're not real! YOU'RE NOT REAL! It's me, Emma. It happened again. The Grey Man. It was dark, and I saw him. He always comes... at night. When you read my stories, they creep inside your mind, taking over like a virus. Shhh... Shhh... I'm so done with this shitty assignment. There's just too much research to do in just two days. Jerk, you're not even listening to me. I'm sorry, babe, did you say something? Hmmph. You know what? Screw this. I'm getting sleepy. Let's just meet up tomorrow before class. But the movie's just getting -- I know, I'm just really, really, really tired. And with you here, I wouldn't be able to resist your sexy ass. I do have a sexy ass. But you should probably get some sleep. I'm going to finish up a couple of things, but I'll text you before I go to bed. Love you, Babe. I love you too. Eliza Braun ran a B and B during the Great Depression. She lured in drifters with cheap rates and hot meals, then slaughtered them in a hidden space behind the bathroom mirror. Police discovered an assortment of jars containing the eyes of the victims preserved in formaldehyde. She was arrested and sentenced to death. During the trial, she told the crowded courtroom that she would come back through a mirror, an invocation, and "the windows to the soul." During the investigation, a single record was recovered from her bedroom. When they played the record, the audio repeated the words "Emcro Sha Vem." I think it's a way of summoning her spirit. Emcro Sha Vem... That was pretty lame. 9-1-1. What's the nature of your emergency? I think there's someone in my house. Stay calm. Help is on the way. Eliza Braun ran a B and B during the Great Depression... The virus spreads from one person to the next. Before they know it, everyone is part of the story. Hello? It's Angela. Hello? Angela, this is Mateo's mother. Hi. Yes, I'm sorry, I -- No one's here. I wasn't sure if I should -- Thank you for coming today to watch Mateo. I'm sorry I'm not there to greet you, but I was in a rush and I had to leave. He wasn't feeling too well when I left him. Oh. Does he need anything? No. Just make sure he stays in bed. He needs to rest. Once he's asleep, it's best to leave him be for as long as you can. Oh, yeah, of course. When he wakes up, should I make him anything or -- Thank you for taking this on such short notice. We really appreciate you. I have to go. Okay. Whoa... You scared me. Sorry. Hi, I'm Angela. Your mom called me in to watch you while she was out today. How you feeling? She said you weren't feeling too good. I'm okay. Are you sleepy? I can't sleep. Why not? What's wrong? Nothing. Come here. You know what? When I was your age, I was terrified of the dark. I couldn't sleep without a nightlight. Boop! It helped keep all of the monsters away. And before you know it, I was fast asleep. That's silly. Hey, when you are scared, it works. And don't make fun of me. Do you want to watch something fun on TV? Okay. All right. Let's see... There it is. Here you go. You decide. Do you want a snack? Okay. What does your mom usually make you? Parties are still looking for Jamie Lee, last seen in the Ditmas Park area last Tuesday night. She was walking dogs for residents in a quiet neighborhood... ...when she went missing along with the animals in her care... You'e kidding me... ...anyone with information on Jamie's... ...whereabouts to call their local precinct -- I want to go to bed. What? Are you sure? Okay, then. Let's get you upstairs. Where's your dog? What dog? You want to do a monster check? Nothing here. Nothing in there. No! What's going on with your closet? Nothing. Don't touch that! Is that for... monsters? It's for El Cuco. To keep him out. El Cuco? He's always hungry. I have to feed him. My mom's afraid of him, too. And I want her to come home. Hey... It's okay. Your mom seems like a very strong woman. I think she's okay. But you are very brave for thinking of her. Does she know how brave you are? Defending her against El Coco? El Cuco! El Cuco, I mean El Cuco! Remember what I told you about being afraid of the dark? You still got that nightlight, right? Well... El Cuco can't get you if you flash that light on him. Okay? Now it's time to get to bed. I'm sorry. For what? That's probably your mom. Could you lay back down? I told her I'd have you asleep by the time she got back. Please? No, don't go downstairs! He'll eat you. Nothing's going to eat me. It's fine. Now, please lay back down. Please? Hey -- He's here! Mateo! Mateo? Mateo? Mateo... Dont! Shit! Mateo! Come out here! What are you doing? Come back out here! This is my last story of the night. But I'm still working on the ending. I think I have it figured out. Marco? She told me everything. What? Who's she? "Who's she?" You know who she is. How long? How long did you think you could keep playing me, man? We were going to tell you together. You were going to tell me together. You and my girl. You all were going to tell me you were pregnant with my... I'm sorry. Did you -- She's gone. She's gone, man. The baby -- I loved you. You were my guy... You knew what I wanted to do with her and you were going to be the godfather of my child! Stand the fuck up when I'm talking to you! I'm just -- just -- Just what? Hey, hey, hey -- What? Get your fucking hands down! Okay, okay! Just -- Just wait... Just wait, huh? It'll be all right... just wait -- Now it's time to share it with the world. Help me... Help me... Help me, please... Sorry, Marco. Please! They can't hear you. They're not real... Help me... ...and neither are you. Where do you think you're going? This is your home now! Help me... What kind of storyteller would I be if I let my characters get away with murder? You're story's finished now, Marco. How do you like the ending? I had a little help. My next story... Will be about you. How do you think it will end?
