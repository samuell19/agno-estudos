Cuff him! Hold him hostage! What's on tonight? Our old haunt; it's all set. Didn't you take some booze? Let's have it It's Mr Policeman! Cop? Cop. You're alone? What do you think? Tell me a joke. If it's funny, I'll spare your life. Go ahead! Hurry! What did you say? Cop car! What do we do? Kill him! Turn onto Zhongshan Road. Yes! Blindfold him! You won't get away with this! You won't get away with this! You'll be a thief for once. You owe me a joke. You are the joke! Police! Freeze! Pin him down. Freeze! I'm a policeman. I'm a policeman! A policeman in my hometown for a decade, and arrested as a thief on the first day I was transferred to Changpu. Zhong Cheng? I'm Guanghua, Provincial Criminal Bureau, here to pick you up. Let's go. After we tear these off. Abandoned car discovered in Xinyuan village. I'm on pickup duty. Who? Our new captain. The one who waited in a sewer for seven days and nights to arrest Lu Zhenhai? Go after you pick him up. Roger that. Turn left ahead. Aren't we going to Xinyuan Village? Turn left. Eight minutes. Go ahead; I'll catch up. What are you doing? I'll give you a chance. Tell me a joke. If it's funny, I'll spare your life. A Jeep drove past. Someone got off. Looks like a cop. Two rats... Let's go; North gate. Open the North gate. Stop squirming. Police! Freeze! Cuff him! Hold him hostage! Cop? You're alone? Tell me a joke. If it's funny, I'll let you live. Sorry, Captain. Where is he? Escaped? How could you let him escape? You were in the van with him, and you let him escape. I waited seven days to arrest Lu. I won't let him get away. They just brought data on migrants. These are lost vehicle files. And these? They may be related to the Friendship Store case. This was the Huaihai Road telecommunications office case last July 16. 8 gunshots, over ¥400 thousand cash taken. Early this year, the Changpu Plaza gold jewelry display case robbery. Over ¥1.5 million worth of gold taken. This is a gang of six. Always masked, so no facial features are seen. There is now. Where? His ear is missing a piece Right, you bit him? How did it taste? Shell casings found on scene. Thee are tiny grooves at the bottom. Shell casings from July 16 and January 3 cases with the same grooves. 7.62 mm caliber. But they use Browning M1910s made in Belgium, popular in Europe. Those are 7.65 mm caliber. These grooves were made because the shell is too short. They're purposely misleading us. Do you have wall calendars? With foreign girls in swimsuits with floral prints. October. You have what you came for. Why are you still here? It's a cops and robbers film. I'll see how cops make their arrests and learn from them. Three teams, two motorcycles and one police car arrived on scene via three routes. The police car got close on Zhongshan Road. They were going from east to west on Fumin Road. That was their only way out. They always seem to be a step ahead of us. They've had us in their sights long ago. Perfect view. Let's do it here. Sharpei, call the cops. Someone is fighting at Pucheng Bank at Huashan; come quickly! One metal gate, one wooden door, 4 safes inside the vault. Shanghai brand, model E79. I can crack them. How long? 3 sets of numbers from 1 to 100. 90 seconds to get the contact point, 60 seconds for tumbler turns, 30 more seconds for 6 combinations, 3 minutes each, 12 minutes for 4. 7 minutes. That was fast. Power drill? No. Can't drill cobalt panels. But we can cut. Acetylene torch? Not fast enough. Thermal lance? Too smoky. All I need is a rope. 7 minutes. Go! We start! This is more direct. Great; you've charmed the key keeper again! Again! Last July, this January, The date of this crime is September 11. They come out when they're hungry. No, they don't. As they eat one meal, they've already planned the next. 6 bowls of noodles. Two thick, two thin. One with no scallions, one cooked Al dente. How long will that take? Ten minutes. Start cooking. We're going to get some cash from the bank, and come back to eat. What do you want? Shut up or die On the ground, now! 5 minutes, 10 seconds. 3 minutes. One rope! How did he open all four safes? Give me your shoelace. Shoelace. Hold this. 5 minutes, 10 seconds. 3 minutes. Get a pencil. Did you pull hard? Not at all. This knot is like a pulley. The theory is called Amplified Gain. They're real pros. Drive. Let's go see. Little girl, hello. We are policemen. You really came! What? A customer told me you would come, and left money. Little girl, some policemen will come later. Tell them it's my treat. How many of them were there? Six. Let's eat. But... should we be treated by a robber? Sit. They were here and knew we'd come. Police will do a blanket check after a robbery. It's easy to guess. Can you identify them? No. Little girl, serve us what they ordered. Thank you. Eat. They ate noodles before robbing the bank? They ate after the robbery, while keeping an eye on us. I know where they watched us from. If they commit another crime, they will buy more ammunition. We'll start there. Who is he? A calendar seller; clues indicate he works for Nabo. The Yunnan arms dealer? Yes. Business must be great to expand to here. Buy our tickets. Two, please. You sell calendars? Yes. Do you have exciting ones? Guanghua, teach him what exciting means. I'll show you exciting. This is exciting. Is it exciting for you? Is it? Who the hell are you? I'll tell you who I am. I'll shoot him dead today. I'll let him know what exciting is. I just had a kid; give me a chance. The guns you sold killed 3 people. Did you give them a chance? Listen to me, Guanghua. If you kill him, you'll die, too. For what you've done, you may not be out of jail even when your child is in university. But if you learn to serve the people, it will be different; understand? Yes. Let's go. It's a cops and robbers film. I want to see how the robbers escape, and learn from them. Yes, Mother, I'll bring the mooncakes the work unit has given us. Don't worry. Relax, okay? That's it, then. Cheer up, it's Moon Festival. My mom wants to speak with my girlfriend. What girlfriend? I lied and told her I'm dating a colleague. Ask her to help you and say a few words She'll help; it may lead to a date! Shut up! Pretending to be a girlfriend? I can do that! Never mind; take a cake and go. That's so easy. Can you speak to my mother? I told her I have a boyfriend from the station. Sure! Sure! Who knows how to do this? We all do. Pretending about girlfriends, right? No, this math problem. This is the problem: A and B start on a 400 m standard track. Same time, same place, in opposite directions A runs at 3m /second; B at 5m /second. When will they meet up again? Please wait Distance divided by total speed is meet time Isn't this a grade 5 math problem? You know it, come. Hold on a minute. Who is that? My daughter; talk to her. Your daughter? Stop pushing me. Hello, Madam... That's right. Friendship Store, 8 minutes, ¥500,000. Pucheng Bank, 7 minutes, ¥800,000. How long must a cook work to build a house in his hometown? Cheating on foreign exchange, illegal driving, moving rocks at a construction site; how many years, to return home in glory? And you? Only you have gone to school. If I kill you I get an extra share. My mouth is faster than your hand. You learned that from the cop, right? So what if I did? Even if you lose, lose in style. Buddies, we have a big job. Team 3 finally arrested the July 3 car theft ring. There is justice; it's a matter of right timing. Captain, gunshots heard on Zhongshan South branch of Development Bank. There are cops on Yuehe East and South, and Fujiang Middle Streets. Then we'll take Yuefu Road. All units, Team 3 is arriving on scene. There are many civilians; clear the space. Safety first, evacuate the crowd. Control the ground situation. I'll go to the roof. Run, Sharpei. Cops! Team 2, split up to Yuehe East Road. Block Yuehe South Road and Fujiang Middle St. Stop! Get an ambulance; the guy that fell down, I need him alive! Go back. We must not leave captives. Team 2, check out the white van backing up on Yuefu Road. Yes, sir! Gunshots at the bridge! Guanghua, Qibing, go! What's wrong? My daughter! Stay here! Duck! Go! Are you all right? Get out! Now! Grab the taxi! Into the cab! Now! Thank you, Miss! Let me ask you, how is the girl? Fine, just a few scratches. You've educated the mother? Yes. I told her never, ever, to leave her child alone in the car. Good. Now, your turn. Let me educate you. I ask you, were you armed? No. Wearing a bulletproof vest? With no gun and no vest, you just ran out there?! I was saving her! What if you died? You must be alive to save people! You think your police uniform is bulletproof? You can't save anyone when you rush! I'll blow up the police station! I'll blow them all up! Blow them up, I'll blow them up! The rule is, no revenge, no matter who dies. Revenge? That's too crass. The best revenge is to make sure they never catch us. We're escaping? No, we're just expanding the battlefield. I almost forgot to say goodbye to an old friend. Do we need guns? All I need is a rope. The salary box was opened, no money was taken You owe me a joke. Eagle did this. Page 851850: You have new foreign girls? The truck was delivering the South Mine's salaries. Last week, North Mine's were robbed. Last time they killed 6 guards. This time, 3 deaths including the driver. In each robbery they took over a million dollars. Almost 3 million total. That's a lot. The methods of operation are identical. We're sure Eagle and his men did it. What's going on? One man owns both mines. He hadn't paid his workers in months. Finally he got some money together to pay them all at once. Let's take back our money! What are you doing? What are you all doing? Stop! Calm down! Shoot into the air. What are you thinking? Someone robs you of your things, so you rob someone of their things? Ridiculous! And you're breaking the law! I am the Captain of the Crime Bureau of the Changpu Provincial Police Station. My name is Zhong Cheng. I guarantee I will solve this case for you. Give us police a little time. Think of their next target. How big is Qingzhou? About 400 square kilometers. Let's go see it. That's five times as big as Changpu. Hello, sir. How many maps of Qingzhou City do you have? Five. One each; perfect. Memorize every detail. Miss, your star chart is very mixed. The sun is near but the seven deaths are nigh. Whichever man you go with, things will end badly. Your -- Miss! What are you doing? Don't go! You haven't paid! My close friend fell to his death. He looked horrible. Death is death. Who cares what I look like? Are you trying to talk me out of dying? It would be nice to jump off a building. At least you get to fly once. Shall I help you? I don't want to die tonight. I've been here many times but can never do it. Why? If you look down from the third floor, the ground is full of trash. But look down at the same place from the 30th floor, and it looks so beautiful. Every time I sit here I cannot bear to die. You're right. Beauty is everything. There are 73 gold jewelers in the city that match all of Eagle's criteria. This month there were 48 false alarm police calls. Keep watch on them. That's over 100 shops! Keep watch on them all. How can we? Since Eagle is watching us, we must keep watch on them. Early this year, Shanghai Crime Bureau solved a bank robbery with surveillance devices. These Eyes in the Sky can help us watch Eagle. With the help of law enforcement agencies 70% of banks and jewelers in Qingzhou installed surveillance devices to prevent crime. Cop car We saw it at Donghua Street at Reide Jewelers. Can you see the pattern? How about Yulin Jewelers? I went yesterday. The guards have been replaced by cops. So what? I want to confront them. If we rush, then we lose. I ran into another former schoolmate. Doing this all day, I forget if I'm the police or a guard. How much longer must we wait in Qingzhou? We're ignoring all the crimes in Changpu. True, but we haven't worn uniforms in a while, and I look great in this. Not bad. I hadn't spoken to my old schoolmates. It's nice to catch up. Here. I just found this on the street. We should give it to Mr Policeman, right? Yes, we mustn't let Eagle take another penny. That's right. Watch them like a hawk. Don't let them take another penny. You still owe me a joke. Halt! Captain, you're over-exhausted; get some rest Please check pager 2233 for messages. Sorry, sir, there are no messages Please check again How can there be no messages? Sorry, sir, there really is nothing. Gotcha! You have nowhere to hide! What's wrong? Didn't you see? What? You lost; I'll go with you. I wonder, shall we call him He He or Ro Ro? Both sound terrible. That's fine. If they're not twins I'll have another son with you. Two brothers, together they'll be heroes. Does that still sound terrible? Yes! They're panda names! What's this? You need vitamins already? It's for your mother. And this hearing aid. It was hard to get. This time, we must win. This is no fun! It's getting late. Where is Dagou? He's... busy. Doing what? He... ...has some goods coming from Hong Kong What goods? Air conditioners, video players Is robbery so bad? Why smuggle? No one dies from smuggling. We're on the same side. It's been months. We can't make a move in Qingzhou. Our money is almost gone. Besides, Dagou's wife gave him a baby son. That Dagou. Why didn't he tell me? Could we find you? We're all working with Dagou now. Why don't you join us? In fact, my woman is pregnant too. Call Dagou here to play one more time with me. We found grooved bullets on the body. Very likely it's Eagle's work. Qingzhou is a bust, so he went to Wujiang. The body has been identified. Hu Yong, age 47, Wujiang Agriculture Bank Jiangbei Branch Manager. Manager? He has no money; why would Eagle kill him? Three days ago, Hu Yong told the Main Branch the cash held at the branch is at its upper limit. The Main Branch will send a security van so the branch is not storing too much cash. To save money, every trip the van makes it will stop at each of the 8 branches in Wujiang Old City. When will the van depart? Today. Two cream, two lychees. They have not yet made a move. Five more branches left. The further along, the more cash there is. But wait. Jiangbei branch is at an open market. It's barely 2 km from the police station. Isn't that too close? Come with me. Gao LAN, That's a new lipstick, isn't it? You have a date? New shoes? A date? Going to the movies. At long last! Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet, hurry. Please look around. That's mine. Wait. Take this. It's fun. They love to make their move in a crowd. Surround the Jiangbei Branch from three routes: Chen and I, the north; Guanghua, Qibing, west; Cao and Team 3, block them from the south. Guanghua, let me drive. Wujiang is my hometown; I'll drive. Sure. After we catch the robbers I'll take you to noodles I grew up eating them. I don't like noodles. Hurry, 5 minutes! Police? I want to report a case.... Someone is robbing a bank! How many of them are there? Many; they have guns! We'll send someone right away. Robbery in progress at Jiangbei Branch. Roger; on our way. Let's go. Cop car! Crash into it! Their car! It hit us! Get out! Get out! Now! My leg is stuck; you go ahead. No! Get in! Don't let them take even a penny! Hand grenade. Here you go! We grabbed this hand grenade from a child's hands today It was left by Eagle If we hadn't discovered it in time it would have been disastrous There were over thirty injuries today Dead: four cash transporters, two security guards and three civilians. Someone lost a father. Someone lost a husband. Someone lost a child. Someone lost their dearest friend. Eagle is like this hand grenade. If we don't take him down today in Wujiang, Tomorrow he may explode at any time. Today, we lost a good buddy. A good policeman. He is gone. When he was alive, he always said he wouldn't let Eagle take another penny. Not one penny. He succeeded, at the cost of his life. He traded his life for that. Can you do that too? Yes! Sir, two suspects are at Leya Hostel. The suspect is upstairs! Get out! Now! Leave; go now! Careful, don't crowd! Someone is hurt! Take him to hospital. Don't shoot! Freeze! Be careful! Drop the gun! Be careful! There's another suspect in 405! Guanghua, go! Yes, sir! Another step and I'll blow you up.... Calm down! Let me go home... ...to see my child.... Guanghua! Two of the Wujiang robbers have been arrested. The Bureau is still in Wujiang City, searching for the fugitives in the Agriculture Bank robbery-murder. Doctor! How is he? His right hand is too damaged from the blast and must be amputated. We have completed the stump cleansing. Thank you. Pager records of the suspects this month. There are many such groups of numbers. This is a Qingzhou phone number. Boss means it this time. Wenjuan is pregnant. Go check with all gynecologists Qingzhou for pregnant women named Wenjuan. Tell the reporters to say we are still at Wujiang. What do you want? Perfect view. Get out or I'll call the cops! Just listen to what I have to say. Do not speak. Mm. You'll just get a few years in jail, but it's a death sentence for me. Understand? Mm. You should pretend our past never happened. Stay with the man you met last time and I won't worry. Understand? Mm. Pack your things. When I page you, leave. Mm. Paging 38432 with a message. We just received a message. 35-6-7 35-8-8 38-7-1 51-13-8 98-10-10 113-18-4 Lean closer to each other. Smile a bit more. Yes, don't move. Where is he? Three rifles, several bullets. Yes. Captain, I found something. Their wedding picture and residency records. Look. Falcon Zhang. I want every policeman to have this picture within 30 minutes. Yes, sir. Don't be nervous. What do these numbers mean? You can't catch him. But we caught you. He loves to watch people. If I'm not mistaken, in each group of numbers, the first is the page number, the second is the row, and the third should be the word number. 3 o'clock... 3 o'clock. 3, at Peace Theatre. General, backup forces have arrived at the Chu army's rear guard Good; meet the enemy outside the gates! Attack Xiangyu from front and back. Go! I know you want to catch him yourself. But you've met and he knows your face. He'd rather die than get caught. The Chu army is coming Your time is up! Falcon Zhang. Is there something else you want to say? This was not bitten off. It was cut off with a knife. I'm Falcon Zhang. I am Falcon Zhang. I won't let you lose. Bro… Over 800 police comrades finally arrested the Eagle. Congratulations, Captain! Congratulations for finally solving the case. Is this case really solved? There is justice. It's a matter of right timing. Hello, everyone. Behind me here is the Peace Theatre. But what happened here today is not a movie. A major criminal, on the run for 4 years and committed 11 robbery-murders has just been arrested by police in Peace Theatre. I am at Peace Theatre in Qingzhou City. After meticulous planning by the Crime Bureau the Changpu serial killer has finally been arrested. Pretend our past never happened. Stay with the man you met last time and I won't worry. You can't catch him. I know where he is. Mother! Eat mooncakes! Let me tell you a joke: Ming brought home some mixed nut mooncakes. His mother told him off: You are so stupid! Our family is already all nuts. You'll make us more so! I'll get you a new one tomorrow, all right? Look at you. You're filthy! Go take a bath. Here. Go take a bath now. All right. Make sure you're clean! All right. The calendar seller committed suicide. Someone's shooting a gun! He's dead! Call the police! These few years, he had been informing on his competition to us, and clawed his way up. Eagle would go directly to him for guns. But he never imagined... My wife and son died in Wujiang. ...his family would die from the ammo he sold. If Eagle wants more guns he may still go to him. He won't stop. He'll still come to me. Eagle's code is 633. Code name 633. They may use code. Has Eagle always gone to him for his guns all these years? These are pagers for gun dealers that Eagle has contacted. Help me. Tear these off before you go. Persistence without respite. That was worth it. Captain! Take care. Guanghua found several pagers of arms dealers Eagle had contacted. News of the calendar seller's suicide is withheld. Eagle would very likely contact him again. But we must determine where his nest is. He has never hit Yunfeng City; why? Check to see if he has maps of Yunfeng at home. Yunfeng City.... Longping, Wuan, Wujiang. Does he have it? No. If you went back to your hometown, would you bring a map? Yunfeng City is where his nest is. I haven't looked at night scenery in a long time. It's beautiful. Yes. Sometimes I feel it's unrealistic: Down there, thefts, robberies, all kinds of bad things happen. That's why you became a policeman. If Eagle doesn't make another move, we will never catch him. He won't stop. If you're a good cop, and you saw a robber, can you resist going after him? We're like Eagle, possessed by the same demons. He won't stop. But not all crimes can be solved, It's like life. Not everything can be perfect. Are we really watching him forever? I've been a cop for 20 years. Of all the analytics, high tech stuff, techniques, inspiration, none are important. Bite down,and never let go. Yes. You certainly did that to Eagle's ear. Distance divided by the total speed of both equals the next time they meet. That will happen, sooner or later Paging 851850 Where it always rains. The rain will stop soon. Come as soon as you can. I've checked. There are 38 bathhouses in Yunfeng City. Let's split up to check. If you see him, do not panic. Call me right away. Yes, sir; we are not bulletproof. ¥6 for a bath. Is he here? You are his friend? I've been looking for him for years. ¥6 for a bath. I've found him. Call Yunfeng police for backup. Checkmate! You're done for! Captain Zhong! Finally we meet again. You owe me a joke. Do you know how the Eagle fell from the sky? Hey! You're not wearing pants! Eagle put his hands to cover his crotch, and fell to his death. Have you forgotten? Every time we've been able to fly away, Have you forgotten? One from the rooftop and two from the hotel; you failed to take a penny from the armored truck. Also, the Friendship Store That day, when I caught you, what did you say in the van? I'll tell you when I've cuffed you. Tell me now. Maybe I'll fly away again. Kill me! Come, kill me! We can't let Eagle take even a penny I know; we're not bulletproof. Captain! Take care. All I need is a rope. Tell me a joke. If it's funny, I'll let you live. That day when I caught you, what did you say in the van? I'll tell you now What I said in the van was, I'll bite down on you and never let go.
