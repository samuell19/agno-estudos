Not out of love, but out of necessity. Somebody who needed citizenship. And they never lived together. So really, it didn't have anything to do with love or genuine feelings of affection. And a person can't live without these feelings. Not having them has its consequences. It produces isolation, immaturity... ...the feeling that you don't belong anywhere. And I think in the end, that's what has happened to him. The reason that I'm saying all this right now he has a relationship with a girl. And that girl has a baby. And we don't know if the baby is his or not. The truth is, we really want it to be his because because it's something that could change him. It's something that could give him a new life.

So the others suffered through it, and he was a constant pest. Wouldn't I please teach him? Yes, he would practice. Blah, blah, blah. A child performer is cute, but it doesn't do the kid any good. That's where he lived. We pretty much use it for storage. Matthew got mad at me, uh, after he got out of prison. No, when he was in prison. And I don't want to discuss prison. But he had asked me to contact a music teacher... that he had had many years ago in... and try to get a tape. And I wasn't about to call that music teacher and say, "Hey, my son's in prison. Do you still have his tape?" And Matthew did not like that whatsoever. And that's the last we heard from Matthew for many years. Here's one that was his. And then he doesn't have any more after that.

We were told that there were a few times... that he came out here... and drove right past the road down on Route 16... and never came up here to say hello. I don't think he probably wants to. And I have the feeling, and it's probably horrible, if I died right now, he wouldn't give two cents. So there you have it. Matthew is Matthew.
