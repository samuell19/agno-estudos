What animus do you've for me? No animus But for a murder, there has to be a murderer That's why you put the blame on me? Yes I had planned every step meticulously Now listen to the important thing You're going to be hanged Tell the court that you've committed the murder I'll appeal to the court, that you shouldn't be hanged But be awarded life imprisonment Life imprisonment only 14 years punishment I'll pay you for that 14 lakhs dollars 1 lakh dollar per year, I'll send to Priya Outside Priya'll we be happy, & you'll also be happy This case is related to Indians And here the court language is French That's why I'll translate the court proceedings, in Hindi By the statement of Vikram Bajaj & of witnesses And by the evidences The case of Sonia Bajaj's murder is very clear Sonia Bajaj & Vikram Bajaj Were not only neighbours of Raj & Priya But they were intimate friends also On the day of murder, it was Vikram Bajaj's birthday And to celebrate it all the 4 went out And returned around 1.30am Sonia & Priya went to their respective homes Raj & Vikram continued drinking outside the house Liquor exhausted at about 2.30am But Raj wanted to drink more That's why he asked Vikram to come to the Airport bar It's a lie, I didn't tell him anything I never told him to come to the Airport bar We didn't go to the Airport bar either You'll be given a chance to speak Raj knows that his wife Priya won't allow him to drink more That's why Raj sent Vikram to take Priya's permission After that both of them went to the Airport in Vikram's car Two! Only 1 had gone After reaching there Vikram realized that He has left behind his credit card & purse Taking advantage of this Raj also pretended and said That he has left his purse with Priya He told Vikram to sit in the bar And he alone went home to bring the money Alone! 2 came Vikram waited for Raj till 5.30am And Raj instead of going to his house went to Sonia Who was alone in the house To satisfy his lust with Sonia He couldn't have had a better opportunity But when Sonia refused to accept his offer Then under the influence of liquor and anger He killed Sonia with the liquor bottle This is all a lie This is a ploy of Vicky He wants to entangle me If you once again talk in the middle Court'll take serious action against you Your honour Whatever I've started 1st proof is forensic report which'll substantiate it By which it's proved That the bottle which was used to murder Sonia had Raj's finger prints You make me drink with your hands Me? Okay! Have it I seek permission of the Court to call my first witness I had seen only one not two, going on that night While coming back they were two, not one I find something fishy in this L.P. L.

Nothing... nothing... What happened? Police couldn't apprehend Raj They've a doubt that he'll definitely try to meet or call you? It isn't good for Raj to have escaped from court Still there's time for him to surrender to the Police Otherwise, I fear, he may end up dead in police encounter I want to tell you something Please listen to me I didn't kill Sonia It wasn't me who told that in Mauritius, it was Vicky If it was told by Vicky, why didn't you tell me even after many pleadings? That was my biggest mistake But, I didn't kill Sonia It was a plan by Vicky to trap me Then, why did you escape from the court? Because, you're my Supreme Court Look into my eyes once If you feel I'm the criminal I'll surrender myself to the Police I didn't kill Sonia You're my Supreme Court If you feel I'm the criminal I'll surrender myself to the Police Your love & your confidence is with me Now, I can prove myself innocent But, how will you do it? Vicky told the court that we both went to the Airport together But, I never went to the Airport If I can prove it I can find a way out of it I'll tell you one thing, I've seen with my own eyes on that night When they went out, they weren't two, it was only one While coming they were not one but two Yesterday BP & his wife came to deliver food BP wanted to tell me about something secretly from Police May be he knows about something You go home otherwise Vicky will get suspicious I'll go & meet BP in his restaurant Who? Where did these bums have come from? Don't know from where they've come? Do they've to come here only? Let them've 4 pegs, I'll put to sleep here only Bloody scotch-Equal Bloody, they're asking me... People standing next to you're police They're police... I've something important to talk with you Not now! Wait for some time meet me outside! -Where? A place where no one visits! Behind Alphi's shop! Use this lighter fool! Fool! Fool! My father was a fool! My grandpa was a fool! You too are a fool! Beat me with my own stick As you saw! So you reap! I'm dead! Okay, tell me BP, when you went to Priya on that night with food! Yes! -What was that you, wanted to tell her? What did Vicky tell in the court that day? That you both went to Airport together! I had seen that night they were not two, but only one went And while coming back, they were two not one You mean? - I'll explain you! When I was about to go to sleep I heard the sound of footsteps outside I went to the window and saw! ...Do you know what I saw? A person came out of Vicky's house ...And got into the car Started it & went away! It must've been Vicky only! What did you see after that? After that, I went back to sleep! Then suddenly, I woke up to the sound of a car When I went to the door and looked out I saw a long car coming and stopping infront of Vicky's house Two fat and tall men got down from the car Took out some things from the dicky! And went straight into house Tell man? Were you wearing your glasses at that time? That was the mistake I did I wasn't wearing my glasses That means the car you saw was Vicky's car You saw two men getting down from it! One of the two was Vicky! The second one who's involved in Sonia's murder with Vicky! Only that man can become the witness for my innocence But, where do we search for him? We can get information about him from Vicky's house only So, when Vicky's Isn't at home? I've to enter his house at an oppurtune time! But do you know how much police security's there around his house? I'll find out a way for it! Save life festival! It won't taste good! You're here, he'll be there save life festival! Thanks for chicken! They fell into our net ...Come... Come... let's go... Searching for evidences? You'll not find anything! Evidences are left by chance And I don't do anything by chance I've already told you Raj once The thing for which you're searching I've it with me! Unsheathed sword & loaded pistol shouldn't be kept in open, Mr. Planner All your plans will turn upside down Tell me, why did you trap me in Sonia's murder case? You can never shoot me! You're not a murderer I'm the murderer! I've committed the murder You're searching evidence for proving your innocence Which you can never get! And you can't go out from here Because police will be coming in at any moment! I'll go out I'll go out from here infront of you & the police The police will not stop me ...lt'll stop you ...You've come Put some sense into him He's behaving like a kid Priya, come here - No Priya Don't go to him, he's gone mad completely He'll kill you also He's not the Assasin You're the assasin Only Bastards like you will kill their wives Raj isn't like that He's fooling you She's his wife He'll escape I'll deflat the tyres Did you find anything from Vicky's house? No I didn't find any evidence He has planned for everything The Bastard was true There's nothing like by chance in this world This boarding pass was inside that book 29 December? That was the day Sonia was murdered And she was in Zurich at that time Then how could she come from Geneva to Zurich? This is very fishy When a Sonia is dead here How could another Sonia come from Geneva to Zurich? Because, she wasn't Sonia Bajaj she was some one else And she has come here on that night under the name of Sonia Then, the person who was seen with Vicky on that night It wasn't a man, but a woman whom I saw! Then, who could it be? I had seen Vicky with a girl in Mauritius And the way they met each other! Sonia was also very disturbed on seeing them! I felt there's something of an affair between them! She'll be that girl only! And to search her, I've to go to Geneva I can get her address with the help of this boarding pass But, how can we go there? Every way out of this city is being checked thoroughly by police Do one thing, you go through spanish way There had been a heavy snow fall there! It's very deserted place Go by that route! Oh! Raj here also there's a police check post Shall we turn back the car? No, they'll get suspicious! They're checking for licenses what shall we do now? You come into the driver's seat! Why? Do as I order you Raj this is bungalow No! 56B! This is Vikaram & Sonia's Bungalow! That means the girl who came there Her ticket was booked on Sonia's name And on Sonia's address So that no one gets suspicious! Where are we to search for her? The sign on board says she's out There's no one at home! There's someone inside! May be it's that girl only! You be here only! I'll check out! Who are you? What are you doing here? First, you tell me why're you here? Leave it, you first tell me who're you? -other wise I'll shoot you I'm an Insurance Detective! I'm here for investigation What're you investigating? Vikram had insured his wife's life with our company for $100 millions Insurance for $100 millions? - Yes! And today's the last day for the payment And I was here to take a last chance That I may get any clue leading to involvement of Vikram in Sonia's murder But, I couldn't get any such clue - I'll give you a clue! I got this boarding pass from Vikram's car How could this be? She was murdered on this day only Then how could she come from Geneva to Zurich! I've came from Zunich to Geneva to find out only this! When I enquired with Airlines I got this address Understood! This girl is Vikram's friend Neeta Do you know her? - No! But, Vikram came to me a few days after the murder To expediate the Insurance payment he offered me bribe also I got suspicious When I enquired about him I found out that... He had an affair with a girl named Neeta before his marriage But, I could never find that girl! I had seen her once in Mauritius! If we're able to locate her then your company will be saved by $100 millions And I could get the evidence to prove my innocence! For this, I must first stop Vikram's payment! Come with me! He has been paid! He has already transferred the entire amount by computer to his account! Can you tell me his account number? He has transferred entire money into his Singapore Account! Not the entire money! He has transferred $1 lakh to ship! That means he's travelling to Singapore by ship Then that girl Neeta will also be with him! Yes? I must also go by this ship! I'm being persecuted for your murder! And you're alive!? Tell me what's the plan of you both? Whom did Vikram kill & trap me in to that murder case? Come on tell! - Why're you asking her? I'll tell you come! I'll tell you everything, leisurely! You've done a good thing by coming here In few hours this ship will cross swiss boundaries After that swiss laws can't harm neither you nor me Take it! Oh! I've forgot that you'll not be conscious after drinks And to understand my plan It's a necessity that you must be conscious So, you want to know if this Sonia Bajaj is alive! Then, who's the girl who's dead ...She was infact Sonia Bajaj! She's my girlfriend! - Neeta Vikram Bajaj, whom you're thinking is a Billionaire Is actually not a Billonaire! A few days back he was a an ordinary drummer in a Geneva Bar I was playing drum there and Neeta used to dance there Neeta, from today, you're not going to dance! I can't tolerate anyone touching you, quit all this Quit?! If I quit all this who'll pay me so much money I'll give you! I'll do anything for you I'll fulfill all your needs! I too love you! My way of living is not just to live for living sake I want to enjoy life like the rich do! And you can never earn so much wealth by playing drum in a bar You want wealth Isn't it? I'll get you wealth! After that Vicky didn't meet me for next 3 months! One day suddenly... Great, today you look like a Richman - I've married a rich girl! Not for me, but for you! -For me? My wife's life is insured for 100 million If you co-operate with me Those 100 millions will be ours I've a game plan And the first step of that game plan was... To bring my girl friend Neeta as my wife Sonia to Zurich And to search for such a scapegoat Who's not only a bachelor but must be of my age Luck was in my favour! One day you & Priya came there to reside As soon as I saw you, I felt my work is over And my next step was to make you get attracted towards Neeta That's why willingly she stepped infront of your car And play acting about insurance I took you both to Mauritius Because, the final step of plan was to get executed there only That was killing Sonia and getting you accused for it That's why I called Sonia also to come to Mauritius Do you remember? That college friends ...the same one... She was Sonia Bajaj my real wife! That's why to get intimate with you Neeta played the kiss drama So, that when I play the trump card of wife swapping You'll easily fall for her But you turned out to be a Devoted husband! That you had a fight with me and spoiled all my plans Even then, we were not discouraged man! To befriend you again we saught your forgiveness And played the drama of jack slip - And then This time, I was successful you went to Neeta and fell unconscious And then I carried you to next bedroom and put you on a bed Neeta you be here only! I'll go to airport to receive Sonia If he regains consciousness You don't worry! He'll not regain consiciousness till morning I've added sleeping pills in his drinks! Go! Sonia coming here wasn't any coincidence, it was my plan I asked Sonia to sit in car and went into Airport Restaurant So that, I'll have a witness I went to him and asked for a bottle of whisky! And lied him that I didn't have money That my friends will come with money As soon as he comes I'll settle the bill! And when I saw the manager getting busy with other customers I slipped out from there silently! Hey! Since when you've started believing in by chance This is not only book it's my friends And I came home with Sonia Do you remember you wore a nightie same like this on our first night I want to see you again like that! Wear this and get ready to go to Airport I picked up the bottle on which your finger prints had been imprinted What's the matter? Today you're in very Romantic mood! I was eagerly waiting for this night only What? Wantonly I smashed with a bottle & disfigured her face So, that no one could recognise her And after that sending off Neeta on Geneva flight! Silently I went into Airport restaurent & sat there! I made the bartender believe that I was there in bar till early hours I was successful in the risk I had taken I gave my watch to bartender and made him into a witness! People spend their lives, even then they can't earn a million And, within 5 months I've become proud owner of 100 millons Why do you always say by chance? What did it gave you? One peg! One peg? Yes! Because, its a day of celebration! That's why I'll also join you! You're a great planner! How intelligently you've planned But every intelligent has a streak of foolishness in him Other than himself he considers the entire world as foolish! You too are one of those overconfidence fools You're thinking that I'm here to escape from police I am not here to escape from police I was here to know your plan And in your over confidence you told me everything! And now you may be thinking how I could find your whereabouts By chance! Can you recognise this boarding pass? This was your real wife Sonia Bajaj's And I found this in your car By coincidence in the book"Coincidence" Which you were making fun of! Then, by chance I met Insurance detective Through him I came to know that you've got the insurence money And that you've transferred $1,00,000 to the ship! Okay! Even if you know my plan what can you do? Within few hours this ship will cross swiss boundaries And after that we'll be miles far away Wait! Before you go miles far away I'll tell you a joke! Which is narrated to school children Which you may've never heard it Because you're from streets! Then listen A tortoise & a hare were friends One day they had a race between them! And the hare surged forward immediately And reaching near the winning post it slept of without any worry! The foolish hare never knew when the tortoise had come & overtook it Is it a joke? No, this is a story! The joke is that our story is a exactly like the story of Tortoise & Hare In which I've won not you What are you blabbering? The plan by me was successful I've my Neeta with me I've $100 million! What do you've? Nothing... l've won! I can't explain you in words There'll be a computer here Isn't it? Come, I'll explain it you with modern technology Come... Come! This is my Singapore Bank's account number How could you know it? That's what I want to show you People generally have a password that can be easily remembered Like... But you can't do like that Because you're a Bastard Then what could be your password? You always repeat a word Isn't it this Did you see Mr. Planner? You earned $100 millions in 5 months with a plan And in just 5 minutes I redeposited your entire amount into Insurance account Now from a Billionaire you're again become a penniless man Take two sticks and go back to some bar & play drums & make this girl dance No use of holding my collar Can you see this mike? Whatever you said has been recorded And the tape recorder is there! You take this and inform the security! Neeta is dead! Toilet is there Father, they didn't mean toilet! It's welcome Is he your FIL? (Father-in-law) You too've come back to India? Where we'll go? There's pollution, corruption here But there's BJP here! Bahut Jyada pyar(Too much of Love) Now, it's a fashion of taking out Albums! Every Sikh is cutting an Album We've a Sikh in house! I've planned to cut an Album on National integration A Bengali song in the voice of a Sikh! Sing man! My Album's name is'Bhalo'! Raj, you've not yet introduced them to me I'm a MBBS! No... No... No MBBS means...,
