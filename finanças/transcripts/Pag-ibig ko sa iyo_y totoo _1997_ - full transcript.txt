He is right in establishing, Task Force Sea Lion. I hope the both of you, will keep up the good work! Sorry! - It's fine! - I forgot you had wounds there! Oh, it's your turn! - Congratulations! - Thank you, Sir! Even if you are not in the area, It's just an adrenaline rush! Never mind Cortez, I already know it! I thought, Beth has already decided, to save before getting married. I don't know Mom, why they're in a hurry! That's for your own good, Beth! I don't want your life to be at risk. What I want, after our wedding, you will stop working! Oh my! I don't want to retire! I still enjoy my job a lot, This is really my dream! And Mom knows it! Even if I'm a woman, an only child, she didn't really object, when I decided, to follow the path of my father. That's the truth Mario! For your information, before Berto became a Chief of Police, He was awarded the Most Outstanding Policeman for seven years. I know that Mom! But it is not the same when she stays at home. So that someone may help me, of the few livelihoods left by father. You better talk that with Beth first. Only you have my blessing. After all, you're both of the same age, Wait a minute, I'll just fix our food. Oh, what now, I will prepare the invitation. Can I still refuse? Kiss first! When we get married! Joke only! Kiss! Fred! Take care of those paperwork! I need that tomorrow. Yes Sir! You're really lucky Mr. Lopez! It's your cockpit, you're still learning to be a champion in derby here. Take your sit! You know, It's only seasonal. You visited? Is it about the closure order you gave me? We already have an agreement, right? Why? Did the extension I ask you hard enough? As a President, my job, is to implement the Company Policy. the Board of Directors of the company makes the decision. But you can still do anything if you like Mr. Lopez. But you didn't help me. You owe 20 million to the company, And, I didn't just give you a chance. You're unbelievable! It's like you didn't start from the bottom! You just got money, you became arrogant! I worked hard, for me to reach where I am right now. And this, I'm not boasting it to you. Now, if you have nothing to say, excuse me, I still have a lot of work to do. Sir! Pedyong is there! What? Oh! Ah! Oh, Pedyong! Your place here is nice, Mr. Diaz! This is not mine! I'm just renting! By the way, I have a confidential work for you. Make sure to do it well. My troop has not yet failed any job Mr. Diaz. Just tell me what it is! I want you to kidnap someone. Kidnap for ransom? That's fine with me! If the price is right! Hi! Yeah! right. Dad! Are you coming with me? We agreed with your mom, she will take care of everything. I'll go back to the coliseum, My rooster might win. And I'm not there. Dad, your rooster is more important than your own children. Your mom already knows this! These roosters are for fighting! Not for poultry! Fine, dad! - Take care! - Okay, fine! Good luck! Thank you! Oh, hi! - Come with us! - Okay! - Congratulations Direk, - Thank you! - for the successful concert. - Thank you! Good work Cristina. - Thank you! - Director! You may come with us!

Why? Come here! Get down! What do you want? Don't ask questions! Go ahead! Okay! Get in! Don't worry friend! We will do everything to save him. What I'm scared of is, they might kill Rene, when they find out, I talked to you. They won't do that Ma'am! All they need is money. So I assure you, they will contact you again. Friend, That is why those kidnappers are confident, because there are victims who don't want to complain, won't cooperate, they keep it secret from the law, how can we take action to resolve the case? You did the right thing. Now we can prepare, and plan. You're our only hope, godfather. Not just me! All my troops are there. They are all dependable, and trustworthy. And who is she? Ah, she's Beth! She's my buddy! Ma'am! If possible, make your conversation longer, so we can trace them. Buddy, huh? Hello! Oh, is the money complete? Yes. It's complete! Good! Just a reminder, ma'am. Your daughter will bring the money. Why my child only? And don't ever conspire with the Police, if you still want to see your husband alive. Understood? I thought, all you need is money? Hello! Got it? - Hello! - Gone! So? Can we trace it? Sir, the conversation didn't last five minutes. Friend, what are we going to do now? Sir! This is for madam. It's important. Excuse me Ma'am, this is for you, the guard says it's important. What is this? This is the draft point diagram. Study it Lieutenant! The money? Here! Is that complete? 20 million, where's Dad? There! Can I see the money? Oh! Give me the money! Let's go! Sir, this one is still alive. Sir! Why are they not here yet? What could have happened to them? Maybe they failed! Sir! Maybe when Pedyong got the money, he ran away! He won't do that! Sir! I know Pedyong, he has integrity. Because it's already late night! They should be here. Just relax, sir. They will come! If they won't arrive, go to the other safe house. - Yes, Sir! - Yes, Sir! - Go there! - You go there! Lay down! We are policemen! No one move! Diaz! Don't ever try to fight back! Put down your guns! Put it down! This is not bribery, Lieutenant! It's just small amount! And don't worry, I willingly give it to you, for saving my life. We cannot accept that, Mr. Lopez! If we had risked our lives, that's the fulfillment of our duty. So you have nothing to worry about! You're admirable, Lieutenant! I hope all public servants have the same principle. Thank you! Alright, - We will not stay any longer. - Thank you very much! - Please be well! - Yes! Okay, ma'am. We'll go ahead Sir! Okay! We will go ahead! Unfriendly! What now sweetheart, we'll go ahead! Okay! - See you later! - Okay! Ilagan! Take charge of them! Yes, Sir! Okay! Beth! Wait for a minute! Why Sir? I swear at your grave, Father! I will not stop until the clan of Lopez will be wiped out, and everyone who has connection to your death. Boss! I know where they are! Hongkong? Wow! That's good. Tickets are still cheap! But the problem, money for shopping! We might spend the money we saved up! You know, for our wedding. That's not a problem! If you want, the ticket is yours, mine is the pocket money. And if you're really struggling, I will take care of everything. Wait! Wait! It looks like you have a lot of money! And who bribed you? What do you think of me, corrupt? And who's that philanthropist that gives you money? Well? Not a philanthropist! The one who gave me was commodore! A while ago! Advance gift for our wedding. - From Sir? - Yeah. Wait! Wait! I think I understand... - Why did you accept? - Why? It's embarrassing for Mr. Lopez, Maybe they thought we are receiving bribe. I said gift, Not bribe! Don't you understand? Gift! If you really don't want, then... I'll give it back! Besides, you're the boss. But, you know the elders have a saying. They said, It's not good to deny grace. The eyes are dimming! I don't want to get married, with blurry eyes, okay! Yeah, right! Your style is really rotten! That's why you love me, Not just love, more than love! Really? - Get out from there! - What's going on? Boss! We got it wrong! Hey! Where is Lopez? I don't know any Lopez! What do you mean nothing? The patient here yesterday, where? The patient you're looking for, they checked out yesterday. And him... He was just admitted this morning! Sir, coffee! We have an hour left, Beth is not yet here. We might miss the plane. Sir, relax! Maybe she's stuck in traffic. Here! Do you think your boss will like this? Don't worry! Everything that you give, he liked it. And also, Even if you give me for free, I will like it too. Don't worry if I come back, I also have a gift for you. You might wrap up China for me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Don't touch my bag! Ilagan, stop the car. What? - Why Ma'am? - Stop the car! - My bag! - Stop that! I'm a cop! Help me! Run! My bag! Stop the car! Move aside! Cross! Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Lt. Mario Romero, please proceed to the coastal alley. Lt. Mario Romero, please proceed to the coastal alley. Sir, that is Ilagan! Firing position! Ready! Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire! Ready! Arms! Ma'am, please accept this flag. Because it's a symbol of your child's heroism. You also have the right here, Mar! Sir! Maybe you want to rest? Because, It's getting dark. There's a thunderstorm, it might be raining. Ah, Fred, Fred, wait for a while! Yes, Sir! Ah, it is better, if you head to the meeting place. They might get bored. And discuss with them, our Business Proposals. Tell them, I'll follow. I have something important to talk with. Yes, Sir. - See you! - Okay Sir! Let's go! He will just go later! How come he survived? Didn't I tell you to make it sure? Boss! Who would have thought he was not in the car? We all followed your plan. Yes. But the most important thing that you forgot, is to make sure he is in the car before you explode it. Leave me alone! Who exactly is this? Do I owe someone? A lot, Lopez! Life! You owe me life! You are still lucky, because if you happen to be riding in your car, you would be dead! But never mind, We will still meet soon. Because I won't stop until I drop you into the pit. You, and all of your family. Hello! Hello! Hello! What's wrong? Who are you talking to? Maybe he is, the one who ambushed, and exploded my car earlier. What did he tell you? He will kill all of us! Dulce, come with us to America. No, mom. I will stay here! We will go for a Business Conference there, I will get bored there. I'm there. At least I'm sure you're safe! And, we'll tour around. Mom, I have to attend to several commitments. I don't want to ruin it! My career has just peaked for now. Okay! Okay! Don't force her! Dulce. This is one thing we have to agree on, you will be under the supervision of your godfather, while we are gone. Agree? Don't worry friend! I have people who will guard your daughter, 24 hours if possible. They will make sure to watch over her. What happened? He's drunk! Sir! Looks like you're drunk, Sir. I'm not drunk! Better yet, get me beer! Sir, you're already drunk. Please go home. Oh my! I'm not drunk! - That's it, Sir. - Just get me a beer! Ah, I can't, you're already drunk. Come on! You're so greedy! I'm telling you I'm not drunk! You! Quick! Come here! Stand! You're tough! We're cops! Okay, there! Lieutenant, are you hurt? What now, sir? I'll take them to the Headquarters first! No! What? Because, it's my fault. Just pay for all the damages here. Yes, Sir! Allan, you have to pay all the damage here. Wait! Why me? What? I won't! Just pay it! I know, it still hurts, Mario. But, there is nothing you can do but accept that Beth is gone. I love Beth, Sir! I can't just forget her. I know Mario! But you must not ruin your life. Don't you know, Beth won't be at peace because of what you're doing. Like a while ago, If Ilagan din't arrive, you would've gotten hurt because of a trivial thing. I'm sorry, Sir! It will not happen again! It should not be repeated! That's why I'm giving you another assignment. What is it, Sir? Remember my goddaughter who's a singer? Dulce Lopez? Yes Sir! There are people who want to kill her. I want you and your men, to ensure her safety and security. Yes Sir, but, it's not already our job, Sir. Why doesn't she get a bodyguard from an agency? We are Law Enforcers, Mario. Our salaries come from the tax payers in the government. So every citizen has a right, to receive our help and protection. and the motto of Task Force Sea Lion is, to protect and to serve. - Yes, sir, but... - No buts. That's an order Lieutenant! Yes Sir! Good day Madam! - Good day! - Good day too! Who is your companion here? Only me. Damian, where's your family? The children are on vacation, they went home to our province. Ah, come here! Come here! You're not yet allowed to enter. Men, search the area! Yes Sir! Friend, go there! Wait, what kind of foolishness is this? This is our house, our place! This is a private property! Why did you need to search? This is an SOP! And one more thing, maybe we need to get in the car again, and we might be hit by snipers here. - Understood? - You made us go down! I didn't ask you to get out from here. I just open the door. So, can we? What now? I'm already bored here! Your men are slow! It won't take long. We just want to make sure. Sir! The area is clear! The area is clear! It's already clear Miss Lopez! Whatever. So meticulous! Sir, the perimeter is already secured! Okay! What? What did you say? I'm not telling it to you, I'm speaking to myself! What? I'm already here! I'm safe here! What are you doing? You can go now! You're here, so we need to be here! We're going to guard you! What? Are you kidding me? I never wanted a dog, who'll keep following me around! What do you think of me, a kid? - Miss Lopez. - Correction please! Madam! We are not your servants, Miss Lopez. So, you aren't! Then you can go now! All the people here in this area calls me Madam. Do you understand? Fine, if that's what you want. There is a special order to us from Commodore Manalo, to watch over you. So, whether you like it or not, you have to follow our rules and regulations. - Do you understand Madam? - Wait! Wait! This is our place. And please! Martial Law is over. And even if you are a cop, you can't tell people what to do! For your information, I'm not a cop. I'm a Navy! Graduate in Annapolis! Annapolis? What is that? Street name in Greenhills. I thought you were smart? Naval Academy, Annapolis Naval Academy, that's in America! I graduated there! Either Annapolis or Police, That's all the same! You have no right to stop me, or limit whatever I want to do. Is it clear? Don't try me, Madam! You'll be in big trouble. Just think about it, that we are doing this, for your own good. You might think, I'd like to be Kevin Costner in your life? Hello! Kevin Costner? Yuck! Are you okay? Unbelivable. He's handsome unlike you. and if only I didn't know that, you are my godfather's people, I might thought you are a criminal. Look at your face, you look like a hobo! Hello! Your eyes are blurry! I will call my godfather! You can't do what you want! You are not allowed to use the telephone without permission. If I couldn't control myself. I will beat you. If you can hit me. And where are you going? To the comfort room! Why, do you want to come? Can I? Rude! You're a jerk! Nanny, let's go! Mr. Damian! Oh no, Madam. Your car? It's downstairs! Take it later, on the sea side when it becomes darker. I will wait for you there! Why? Don't ask any more questions until we meet later. Ah, fine. Okay, thank you! Hurry up Mr. Damian, someone might see us. Where are we going Madam? To Makati! What are you doing here? You might think you can escape! You are wrong Madam! So, go back, go back! Go back by yourself! Your face! Ugly! Asshole! Really now? Where are you going? Huh? - Don't touch me! - You can't escape! Okay here! You want to get hit by this! What the! Don't touch me! You might think you can escape from me! I told you don't touch me! I will complain you to my godfather! You are crazy! Let go of me! Meddler! - What do you want? - You're still fighting me! You're really a traitor! Take me down, I told you! I will complain you to Dad, to Mom! Are you not going to drop me? Quiet! Where are you going to keep me? Are you going to keep me there? - Get in! - Watch out for me! - Stay there! - Hold off from me! Stay there! Shame on you! Open this! I told you I don't want this job. You will regret it once I get out! Maybe it's better you assign another person here. Your niece is annoying! Very stubborn! My niece is a good kid. Maybe you forced her, that's why she resisted. No sir! I just followed your instructions. I'm doing my best to get along. But she always resists me! She doesn't want to do what I want! Did you explain, that is for her own good? Yes, Sir. But she insulted me! Sir! I am pleading you, If it is possible, replace me. I'm going crazy over here. Just be patient Lieutenant, you know how spoiled that kid is. In order for you to understand each other, just go along with her. What? That's not what I meant! Use your charm, Lieutenant! Yes Sir! Madam, this is it! Right timing! You will just mix this, to the food cooked by Mr. Damian. And, that Lieutenant will get what he deserves! But nanny... Isn't that bad? We're not going to poison him, we're just messing up his tummy. Let's wake the sleeping worm in the stomach of that giant. So, you got your revenge. Isn't that what you want to happen? Well! Why would I ever feel guilty? If it's not just a sin against God, I will really poison him. That's it! For a moment! I will just distract Mr. Damian. Wait! Wait! Mr. Damian! Oh, Charing don't surprise me. Why? What are you cooking? Madam's favorite. Bangus sinigang with miso. and also, Pork chop! Delicious! Why? - What... - Madam said, accompany me to the town. Asking me to purchase mango and fish paste. Mango, and fish paste? Charing, this is not gossip, Why? Why those food specifically? Is she pregnant? Seriously? Stop that! She is too young, you're giving malice. - It's mango! - You're so irritating. - Wait, who will stay here? - You stop there! Who will cook this? Madam will take charge of that! Madam! Take charge to what Mr. Damian is cooking! Okay, fine. Just be quick! Sir, start while it is still hot! This is delicious! Where's your Madam? Did she eat already? She said, you go first. She's still full. She ate mango. A mango? Yes. Wait! Did she has a boyfriend? Hey! Sir! Sir! Don't think like that, she's still young with many suitors, but... don't think like that. You're so malicious! What? Nothing! You sip the soup while it is still hot. - This seems to be delicious! - Yes. Are you the one who cook this? I started it. But Madam finished it. Wow! This is really delicious! Sir! Sir! Good news, Ilagan and me befriended someone outside, someone cooked goat Caldereta, grilled fish and shrimp. If possible, let's eat lunch there. That's my favorite! Let's go there! Sir, how about this food that we prepared? Let your Madam eat it. And you also. Don't waste food. Look at these people, you prepared delicious food, they just take it for granted! It's Madam who cooked this. She doesn't want to eat. Wait, I'll start eating this! Even with the soup, it's already a dish! Oh no! Nanny, I'm dead! Mr. Damian will be in trouble. The food there is so delicious. Are you full? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Mr. Damian! Hey! What happened to you? I've been to the toilet for 11 times already, but up until now my stomach is still in pain. Ouch! Ouch! What did you eat? Oh no, the food that I cooked, the food Madam finished cooking, the one you left on the table. Ouch, Oh no! Ouch! Would you like me to bring you to the Hospital? What? Ladies first! Sorry Sir! Oh, Lieutenant, Why, you don't want him to eat, this is for us. You? You don't like the dish? I'm just making sure, Madam. Because we don't want to be like Mr. Damian, his stomach was in pain because of the food, that you prepared. Ah, why, what do you think of me, a witch? I didn't say anything like that. It's you who said that. Hey, you jerk! We're feeding you, yet you're acting that way! So, if you don't want to eat the food that I prepared, better buy your own dish. Maybe you want to eat? Sir, I don't have the appetite anymore. It seems I'm full already! You know friend, It also hurt me when dad died. Because he died without any defense. Jet, Don't interfere here. I can do this by myself. I can find ways. Just take care of your business. Your illegal business! My Brother, you almost forgot, isn't it that we're partners in this business? Huh? We're the only ones who know that. You know brother, if there's a conflict, just call me. Because I don't want you to be in dismay. By the way brother, I have new arrivals of guns and bombs too. from Israel. Just put it aside! We will be using that. Election is approaching. Here are the owls! Why are you here? We heard you're in grief sir. So Commodore sent us here. And how can you make me happy? Even seeing your faces makes me more sad. You know sir, we bought a lot of gifts. We have three state side bottles. And... Commodore sent us your allowance. Oh, that's good! Oh, fine, pay first our debt to Ms. Charing. Oh, did you eat already? - Not yet Sir, - Not yet sir! It's best not to eat first. You watch here first, and just eat tomorrow. Sir, - we're hungry and we traveled so long. - Well, accompany them to Ms. Charing. Okay, that's fine! Let's go! - Fine, Sir! - Fine, Sir! Ilagan! - Ilagan! - Sir! Why did you not accompany your Madam? She's inside. She's not inside! At the beach! You already knew sir, why did you ask me then? If something will happen to the Madam, you are accountable to me. Oh it's not balanced. It's now balanced! Ms. Ising, how much is one kilo of this? 70 only, that's it! 70? This is so expensive. Okay, five kilos for this, and five kilos for that. Okay! Come here! What is it? How many times did I tell you, that you can't leave the house without letting us know. What's the matter? I'm known in the area, and I will not be harmed here. Why didn't you ask permission? What's wrong with it? We're only going to the market with Mr. Damian! If something happens to you, I'm accountable for it! Would you want me to be removed from the service? Even going the market you are taking charge, what do you really want? Hey, I don't like you! I'm just fulfilling my duty! Conceited, I don't even mean you like me. Hands off from me! - Help me! - What? Sir, help me! Robber! Don't intervene, I'm in the military. Don't believe him. He's not a robber! He's a kidnapper! Kidnapper? - Yes, you're a kidnapper! - Unbelievable! Get off me! It hurts! You're a kidnapper! Okay, beat him. Go. Quick! Oh my God! I put him in trouble! You fight back! Fight back! Oh, what? Are you coming with me or not? I'm coming! You got me beat up. Just come with me peacefully next time. Let's go there! Oh, right. I'm sorry Lieutenant, I'm just trying to test your courage, You're good in punching. And I just came here, so I can buy your favorite fish. But, I'm really sorry. That's fine! But, don't do that again! You make me nervous. You're feeling nervous too? I'm also like you, with feelings. Ilagan! Good evening Ma'am! It's already late at night, aren't you sleepy? I'm not yet sleepy, Where's Lieutenant? He's by the sea. What is he doing there? It's embarrassing to tell you. He's drinking again. Is he always doing that? No. Only since his girlfriend died. Why don't you tell him that it can harm him? We already told him but he never listens to us. Well, we can't blame him. Because what happened to him was even more painful. When they are about to get married, that's the time Ma'am died. Is that how much he loved your ma'am? Yes, Ma'am! Your boss has intense feelings when he loves. He's one of a kind. What now, Beth? I remember the time, when we were together, happy, sometimes, sad. Rarely, fighting. But, that's natural right? We love each other. And I cannot accept, why did you leave me? I've been faithful to you. I didn't fool you. I wish, you brought me too. It's still here, my friend. Here! He will not, take me for granted. He will not leave me. This I'm sure, loves me.

It only means Sir, you don't know what happened last night? No, not. It's Madam who helped you, It's better Sir, just ask Madam. Good morning Madam! Lieutenant! You're awake! My men said, you are the one who rescued me last night. Yes, why? Do you know what happened last night? Do you remember what you did last night? That's a shame, I'm sorry to you, I don't remember anything because, I was drunk and I thought, I passed out. What? You mean, you don't remember anything? Nothing Madam, I just remembered when I woke up this morning, my beard and my mustache were shaved, I have different clothes already. Did you change my clothes? Yes, why? You mean, you saw? Hey! No, I closed my eyes. And look, your beard is gone. You're pretty handsome You don't look so mean anymore. Thank you Madam! Okay, I'll just go back to my position. Thank you again. Ah, Lieutenant. Madam! Is that... The... The thing on your... Is it a tattoo, or a birth mark? I thought you didn't see? Only that! That is near it. Oh, Lieutenant! My name is Dulce. Okay, alright. Oh, go ahead and replace Atoy, he's sleepy now. Yes Sir. Good evening Madam! Ah, Lieutenant, for you. Thank you Madam! But, I'm not drinking anymore. Since what happened last night, I've sworn off wine. What would you do with that wine if you don't drink it? I'll just make it as souvenir. Especially, it's coming from you. You mean, You only drink when you have problems? Maybe, maybe you're thinking of your partner right? You can't get rid of it, Madam. I love her. You know Lieutenant, Nowadays, you have to be practical. Who knows, when we sleep, we will never see the sunrise again. So whatever the Lord gives us, let's accept it. I already accepted that Madam. Let me talk about something Lieutenant, those who want to kill us, will they stop until we're all gone? Maybe. Maybe because one of them died. They will make sure to get back at your family. Lieutenant! I hope you don't leave us. Don't worry Madam! We will never neglect you. Thank you! Alright. Lieutenant! Madam! Never mind! Okay, good night! Good night. Oh, Only a dream! You know Mr. Damian, I had a nice dream last night. What a waste, It was cut when I was at the good part. It's too bad I woke up immediately. That's the reality of a dream. Choppy, what if you go to sleep now and, you can dream again what the continuation is. You're joking, Mr. Damian! But you know, Mr. Damian, if that's how beautiful my dream is, I just want to sleep, Everyday! Every night! Wait, why can't you forget about your dream? Is it that good? Can you tell me? It's embarrassing. Really now? I took care of you when you were still young, you are embarrassed at me? So, tell me! It's nice right, come on! Okay fine. Okay. It goes like this. There! - What? - Hey, did you hear that? What's that? What... It starts from there! Did you hear those whistles? Whistle? That was the beginning of my beautiful dream. Whistle! I didn't even hear it. I'm really old already! Whistle? Good morning Lieutenant! Good morning Madam! Come have coffee with me. Thank you! Looks like you have a nice day! You're even whistling! Why Madam, is it bad to whistle? It's not that, but... The one you picked is my favorite song. Madam, we have the same favorite song! Huh? Really? Yes. Actually, my dream started with that tune! Madam, you mean... Go ahead, lion two. Ah, Sir, there are fishermen surrounding here, what do you want us to do? Just stand by and I'll proceed there. Copy! Madam, I need to go there first. What a waste! It's cut again! You know our female singer. It's not good to have many stocks there, He is the one looking for you. Oh, really? Hello! Good afternoon! I'm... Greg Henares. Please to meet you! And he is my Musical Arranger, Priscilla. Please to meet you! You may take your sit! Thank you! How can I help you? Regarding, Miss Dulce Lopez. We planned to produce, a big show, and we're interested to get her, as a performer. It depends on the budget! When it comes to budget, we got it covered. The important thing for us is... her availability. Oh no! That's a big problem, Mr. Henares. Because Mr. Lopez is in America, also, Ms. Lopez also is on a vacation.
