Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. So? What do you think? Nice. This is a really good investment. Instead of spending your money on rubber shoes, gadgets and other things. I buy gadgets. I need those for work. That's not true. Why? Let's take a break. Clear this away. It's a good thing you bought a two-bedroom unit. Of course. We can use the spare room and turn it into an office. By the way, I have a question to ask you. Since you brought it up… Babe, do you want to move in here with me? Are you nuts? Why? My mom's going to have a heart attack if I do that. Babe, we've been together for four years. What's the next step in our relationship? You act as if you don't know my mom. Ella? Ella? Ella, you have a call! It's too early! You have a call! Who is it? It's six in the morning! It's Ma'am Fenny, your mother. Ella, you have a call! Jeez! Hello, Ma? Why so grumpy this morning? It's only six in the morning. Hey. It's already 6 a.m. Why are you still asleep? And by the way, I just got back from LA. I came from the airport. Why don't you go to sleep first? Why would I go to sleep? I'm not sleepy. If I sleep now, I'll have jetlag. How was your vacation? It's okay. But I swear, I won't bring your Aunt Virgie with me next time. The whole trip, she did nothing but complain. Do you know how slow that woman walks? Ma, what do you expect? Aunt Virgie is 76 years old. And she already had bypass surgery. Not everyone goes to the gym and does Zumba like you. Why are you so cranky? Bye-bye. You're not fun to talk to. She's driving me crazy. Calling me up at six in the morning. She just got back from LA with her friends. She just called me to complain. Mom, let it go. You should be used to her by now. Maybe she just needs someone to talk to. What? She was with her friends in America for a week and she still needs someone to talk to? Why are you so quiet? Did you have a fight with that moron? Mom. He's not a moron. His name is Migo. And we didn't have a fight. Then why are you so quiet? You have a problem? If a person's quiet, does it automatically mean she has a problem? Mom, it's too early. When did he propose? Mommy won't allow us to move in together if we're not married. What are you doing, Migo? You jerk! What's that? Are you serious? Wait, let me call Gelo. Just keep this between us, okay? I don't want others to find out just yet. Kat, does your mom already know? I'm still waiting for the right time. Your mom has health insurance, right? She might go into ICU if she found out. Not funny! Who's this client? …and he has businesses in Tokyo and Taiwan. Kim Jae who? Kim Jae-ho. So, what's his business? That's the thing. You mean he makes bread? Yes, exactly. Okay… and he wants to buy three cuts of at least 600 square meters here in Laurel Plains? Does he know the cost per square meter? I already told him that. He also asked if he can get a discount if he pays in cash. In fairness. That's right. It looks like he sold a lot of bread to his fellow Koreans. Babe, when are you going to tell your mom? Please, don't pressure me. Kat, be honest with me. Do you really want to be with me for the rest of your life? Oh, my gosh! You're being so dramatic! Why? You're not the problem. Then it's time for you to choose, me or your mother? Are you serious? You're making me choose? So what's your answer? I can't handle this right now. It's way too early! Where are you going? Back to the office! You're leaving? The movie hasn't started! Go watch it yourself! Why are you following me? Darryl, how's the deck? Have they finalized it? And have you emailed our questions and suggestions? They'll email back the deck once they've revised it. Yes, Grandmommy? You're still at work? I'm just finishing something. But I'm almost done. Is Mama there? She's still in Cavite selling property. She'll be late. So come here right away. I made you your favorite callos, brimming with aceite de oliva. And don't tell me you're on a diet. Grandmommy, you keep sabotaging my diet. Ditch your work and come here. I miss my grandchild so much. Next time, you should come with me and my friends. The food is great in Osaka. Then we'll go to Dotonbori. You've been to Dotonbori, right? Yes. Bernice and I went there two years ago. Yes, I remember. She told me she was with her friends. But she forgot to mention that moron would also be there. I thought it was an all-girls trip. But I didn't know the boyfriends would be tagging along. So what? Ma. Katya is a young woman. Wait, Katya. How long have you been together with that moron? Grandmommy, you too? Please he has a name. It's Migo. Stop calling him "moron." That's right. How long have you two been together? Going on four years. Migo. That's a very long time. Your Grandpa and I were only together two years when we got married. Ma, will you stop it? If something happens to her... What do you mean if something happens? What if he gets you pregnant and leaves you? And why do you say Migo will leave me? You know why? Your father left her. Excuse me, he didn't leave me. I broke up with Caloy and left with my daughter. You listen to me, don't be so sure about that guy. Don't say I didn't warn you if he gets you pregnant and leaves you. He's not going to leave me. What makes you so sure? Just trust me. Katya, are you pregnant? No, Grandmommy. I'm not pregnant. Here! Here! What's that? It's a ring, what else! I know it's a ring, Ma! Why do you have that? What did you say? I already have it on me. Why? Ma! I won't allow it! Stop being so dramatic. No! I haven't even tried the callos. Stop your whining. Why did you say yes? Why are you crying? I don't like this! I lost my appetite! Mom, what's going on with you? Ma'am. What now, you need a tranquilizer? No! Why are you so hysterical, Marinella? Why did Katya agree to marry that moron? They're a long-time couple. They would want to marry at some point. That moron is not fit for my daughter! And who are you to say that? I'm her mother. You're so dramatic. Stop acting like you didn't go through the same thing. At least this moron has a career. He's loaded with money. Not like when you flirted Ma! With Katya's father. That doesn't have anything to do with it! What do you mean? You went crazy for that guy because he's a star basketball player. But the truth is, he's good-for-nothing! And then he just left you. Ma, I was the one who left him! Mom, please. What? Are you okay now? You surprised me with your engagement and now you're going to ask me if I'm all right? Since we're already on this issue, I might as well just say it. You're pregnant? I'm not pregnant! Then what? Stop insisting I'm pregnant! Because that's what happened to her. She ran away with your father and got pregnant. Ma, can you just let me talk to my daughter? Okay. I've made up my mind, okay. I'm moving out of the house. I'll be staying at Migo's new townhouse. You'll live together? Eventually, we're going to get married anyway. Then why not wait until you get married? Katya, I agree with your decision. That's a great plan. It has its own advantages. Before you two get married, you can test the waters first. If you're compatible with each other and also, in other aspects. Ma! My daughter is not a car you can just test-drive! Mom! This is crazy! So what have you and your daughter agreed with? I didn't know my daughter could do this to me. Didn't you tell us Katya's boyfriend has a wonderful career? What career? In music? He just edits music into TV commercials. At least he's artistic. He can't feed my daughter by being artistic. Have you had a heart-to-heart talk with her? Yeah, you should. Mom, don't you know how to knock? I have just one thing to say. I won't allow you to live in the same house with that moron. Mom, let me just remind you, I'm 22. I don't care if you're 102. I won't allow it. Mom! I don't want to offend you, but I'm not asking for your permission. I'm just letting you know that I'm moving out and staying with Migo. Because I love him. You have anything more to say? Mom! She told you that? Fabulous! Are you hurt? Because I know I hurt her. Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Mom. Good morning… Katski, your mother's stare is so fierce. Like a death trap! Just ignore it. How about your other stuff? I'll just come back for it some other time. Okay. Thank you. Let me take you to your mother's room. We can both say goodbye to her. Are you serious? No, but I'll take the risk. I just don't want your mother to say anything behind our backs. You're solid, dude. That's true love. Let's go. Before I slap him in the face. Carry that outside. Okay. Mom, it's Migo. Hello, ma'am. Tell her. We just want to let you know we're leaving. Let's go. We'll go ahead. Bye, Mom. Now you know the truth. Yes, what are you going to do with all your money? When are you going to start enjoying it? When you can no longer walk? When you already need to hire a caregiver? You're so frugal. What's going to happen to you? That's right. Hold up. What do you want me to do? Have a facelift? A tummy tuck? Join a Zumba class? Go ahead. Dance like a crazy woman in the middle of the mall? Of course, that's a good idea. Do what Auntie Fenny does. I agree. What? For crying out loud! I don't want to be like my mother. You're just like your mother. I need to pee! Just try it. Just try it. Just give it a try. Babe, what are you doing? I need to find more space. There's no more space. Sorry, I didn't expect your stuff wouldn't fit inside. We can just move them to the next room. All right. Babe, I'm really sorry about our situation right now. Babe, don't worry about it. It's my choice to be here. But if you're worrying about your mom, why don't you call her? Leave her be. I don't want her ruining my day. Remember Kim Jae-ho, the millionaire Korean baker? Why? Is he here? Yes, he's waiting in the conference room. Are they coming or not? What time is our appointment? If they will be late, why don't they at least tell us? Without texting or calling, do they want to do business or not? Time is not a joke and they don't even apologize for it. What are they doing? What did he say? My boss said you're late. Ki-Tae. What? You know, Ki-Tae. You're not kidding? Yes, I'm not kidding. Tell her she's rude! You're rude! No need to translate. I got that. What's his name again? Jae-ho. Jae-ho Kim. You have any more questions? If none, we can talk about our business. Okay? Big, long, hard… land. What's her name again? Ms. Lavides. I have so much money I don't know what to do with it. Sometimes I just throw them away. Do you have pockets? I have so much money! Ask how much the total land area is. What's the total land area for all three properties? Get a calculator. Wait a sec! Don't include our house. Calculate it! Yes, hold on a sec. What is it? Here it is. Won't you offer me something to drink? Coffee? Tea? Run to Starbucks! Hurry! Get the barista, hurry! Give him coffee until he palpitates! Hurry up! So these episodes are mixed media? It's a mixture of live-action and animation. Is it 2D or 3D animation? Both. Miss Kat, someone is looking for you downstairs. It's your Grandmommy. Grandmommy? Yes, Grandmommy. So, how's your live-in partner? Grandmommy, you're making it sound like I'm a kept woman. I didn't say that, I'm not like your time-warped mother. Migo and I are doing fine. I wouldn't move in with him if he's not a nice guy. Have you spoken to your father? We had a video call. Did you tell him you moved in with your boyfriend? I already told him before I even told mom. And what did he say? He said it was my decision to make. That it's my own life. And, whatever will make me happy. Surprising answer. He's not that sharp, you know. That's why your mother left him. So he's happy in Australia? Yes, he is. I knew it. He'd be happy after he and your mother broke up. Your father is a nice guy, but a bit of a dumbass. Maybe he's really kind because he's a dumbass. But… I will buy everything. Everything? Everything! Yes, I like it. Why? Is there a problem? Nothing! No problem. We will prepare the deed of sale. I really like her, ask for her phone number. Ms. Lavides, Mr. Kim has a question. What's your cellphone number? What? You know the number of my office. Tell her because she's divorced and I'm also divorced. What? I heard Alibaba. He found out that you and your husband are separated. And Mr. Kim here is already divorced from his wife. So what? I will throw this jerk down a hole! Give me the umbrella, ma'am. Do what? Give me the umbrella. I will hit him with it. I will shove this down his throat! Now. Ma'am. Are these all the documents? Yes. Ma'am. Yes. Are you sure you're not going to bring me along? You heard what that orangutan said. Just the two of us. But if he tries to make a move on me, he'll see what's coming for him! Oh, my. What's that? So don't he dare. Or he'll be blind for three days. Is that so? But did he tell you where he's taking you? No idea. Guys, please make sure to send the link to Singapore. They need it by 10 a.m. tomorrow. I feel like a smoked fish in here! You have a sense of humor. What? The more I look at you, the more attractive you become. I have pneumonia? What? You're close to my ideal type. You're a little old but your face is pretty so it's okay. I said you're so pretty even though you're old. Thank you, I guess. Do you know how to cook? So who cooks at home? My helper. Really? Fancy! Are you richer than me? Not so much. You've already been asking a lot of questions. Just one more question. Why did your husband leave you? Is it because you don't know how to cook? Watch your mouth! And why is your question getting so personal? What do you mean why? My wife left me for an American. She was not satisfied with me. She cheated on you? I'm not surprised. Mr. Kim. Why? How many levels are there on this date? And where else are you planning to take me? Pleasure, my foot! The memories I loved… Crazy… What? There will be fireworks. I love you. What? I love you. I smell like piss? I love you. Just because you fed me grilled squid and sang me songs I don't understand, that doesn't make us close. Okay? You sit here. No way! Stop it! I'll take care of you. Son of a bitch! I'm warning you! Hey! I'm here for the contract, not contact. I'm warning you, Mr. Kim! I don't want professional. I want personal. Kiss me! Back off! Back off! I'm warning you! Still not finished with work? Just doing some revisions. What took you so long? The Singaporean clients are so hard to please. They disapproved of our material. We should have started pre-production last week. Babe. Wait. Why? Can you please not leave dirty dishes in the sink? I had to rush out early this morning. You were the last one to have breakfast. And then? Can you wash the dishes before you leave? So that's my job now? No. That's not what I meant. So what are you saying? I'm just saying the dishes won't clean themselves. Migo, hold on. We shouldn't leave dirty dishes lying around. Why don't we just buy a dishwasher? That will make our lives easier. Babe, a dishwasher still needs someone to operate it. I didn't know it was my job to wash dishes. I didn't say it's your job. I also have to wash dishes too. Fine, I get it! For your sake. I'll clean the dishes. Babe… Please, I'm tired. Ma'am. Shut your mouth! I'm so pissed at that monkey-face! Ella? Don't you call me Ella! Call security! Have him thrown out! Ms. Lavides, my boss wants to explain... What are those flowers for? I don't need those! No one's sick in my family! What? My boss said these flowers are expensive. It's expensive? Then eat it! More than 1,000 pesos. Put it in your salad! I'm sorry. What did he say? He says he's sorry. I don't need your sorry! Ma'am? What? Mr. Kim has already signed the deeds of sale. Give me the flowers. I bought this beautiful vase yesterday. You want more? Can I touch it? Exact amount. Manager's check. Good as cash. Please prepare the official receipts and everything else Mr. Kim needs. Thank you. Okay, ma'am. Hey! Don't touch me! How rude! What did you say? What if I push this jerk off the building? It's rude to ask a woman her age. It's very obvious, from your face. I want to stab him. So what? You're too serious. What do you care about my life? Can I make a request? What? If it's karaoke again, no more! How about this? Why do you want to go on a date with me? Don't you get it? What? I'm much older than you! I want someone with more experience. Marinella, have you talked to your daughter? She doesn't want to talk to me. Did you call her? She's not answering my calls. I won't swallow my pride. I'm her mother. I know the problem with the two of you. You two are exactly the same. That's why you'll never get along. Excuse me, Ma. We're different. Katya takes after her hard-headed father. You're being cranky again. Ma, I can't go on Friday. I have this thing on Friday. With your aging friends. You don't have to know. Don't tell me you have a date. Ma, please! I can see it. You're flirting again. What are you talking about? Ma, what's wrong with you? It's just a reflection! You're embarrassing me! You hypocrite! You're so annoying. You're unbelievable! We still don't have a set date yet. Maybe we'll have it in February. Probably just in the townhouse. Our budget can't afford it yet. I'll take care of it. Grandmommy, no. Where's a nice place to go to? It's always been my dream to go there. Grandmommy, wait a sec. You're coming with us on our honeymoon? I will bring my friends with me. Virgie, Ruby, and Florence. I will bring everybody. Grandmommy. Wait. You want us to have our honeymoon with senior citizens? Did Mom not come because she knows Migo and I will be here? Your mother is so excited to see you. She misses you so much. But she said you're not answering her calls. Me? I'm not answering her calls? I keep calling her but her phone is off. Mom keeps dramatizing every situation. Calm down. She's always been like that. So why is she not here? I don't know if the rumor is true. But… But what? She has a date! Thank you. This is beautiful. So, you like it? I love it. It's so beautiful! Of course, this place is expensive. Not only expensive. My ex-wife is also pretty. She also likes spending money on expensive things. Tell me about your ex. You don't want to hear that. We haven't spoken in 20 years. You have a daughter, right? Yes. Why do you know all this stuff? Did you hire a private investigator? I saw your picture on your desk. Tell me about your daughter. Hyo-jin, come here for a minute. Your daughter is not a property but a human being. You have to let her go at times. Anyway, she's not a thing. Please share what I said to her. Mr. Kim asks, when will you realize that you don't own your daughter? I think that's way too personal. We're not on that level yet. As a mother, you have to let your daughter go outside and make mistakes and by being apart from each other, your relationship will get stronger. Please share what I said. What can I do? I've always been like this. Do it. So you can learn to have fun. You bastard! You know how to speak Filipino. Why bother having a translator? Well, I'm paying her. I need to get my money's worth. Go back to your seat. You're funny. I will change my wardrobe to suit the next place where we are going. Disco! What? I don't like that! So, who brought you to that dance club? That kimchi magnate? Yes. He brought me to La Mallorca. Wow! He took you on a date to La Mallorca? Then he took me to a dance club. I got home at almost 2:30 in the morning. So did you have a good time? It's just fine. He took you to one of the most expensive restaurants in Manila. Then he took you out dancing. He brought you home at 2 a.m. Then you're going to tell me "it's just fine"? Fine, fine. I had a really good time. See! You're such a hypocrite. So you had a good time. The next time Mr. Gangnam invites you out, don't play hard-to-get. We're already taking our maintenance medicine. It's 2021! Go, girl! Fine! So will you go out on a date again with Boy Bulgogi? I think so. Just let me be. Why aren't you answering my calls? Ma, I'm busy. I'm usually onsite when you call. I'm with a client. Who are you meeting so late at night? That man who keeps visiting you at home? Ma, where did you pick up that news? CNN's satellite has got nothing on you. Grandmommy, since when has that man been visiting at home? I'm assuming ever since they met. Of course, your mother won't admit anything. What did the help say? What are Mom and that guy doing? Flirting like teenagers. Flirting? What? What you and Migo do when I'm not around. Teresing was scandalized by your mother's behavior. I told her your mom had not been with a man for a very long time. That's why she's acting this way. I don't need to hear it! Please stop. Why? I'm just telling you the truth. A woman who has been single for a long time, acts a certain way. Grandmommy, my goodness! I don't want to hear it. You don't need to elaborate. I get it already. So who is this man anyway? You keep saying "one more shot". Just one last shot. We're at your house anyway. Fine, one last shot! Let's do it together. Here, take this. Stop it! I thought you were giving me your hand. Cheers! Ella? Ella, phone call! Ella, telephone! Ella! It wasn't a dream. Ella, phone call! Yes, I'll take it! It sounds like you're being tickled. I told you it was Mr. Vasquez. Huh? Vasquez? You said, Velasquez. I said, Vasquez. Is there a problem? Nothing, ma'am. Good morning. She looks so sexy. Hey, girl… Spill the tea! Come on. We're here to listen. Becky, Monchi… Actually, it's like… I don't like what I'm experiencing right now. Why? I don't want to get hurt. Hurt? Cut that crap! Who do you think you are? Young celebrities? Let me slap you in the face. Admit it, you're happy. I can see it on her face. Acting like a teenager. You're right. Stop it! Marinella, tell us the truth. Are you and Mr. Gangnam… doing it? Quiet! Is it huge? Quiet! You're an idiot! Let's cheers to do that! Cheers! Grandmommy, so what's your urgent news? Has your mother spoken to you? About what? I heard something. Don't be surprised. I heard that… she's letting her boyfriend sleep in her house. He's sleeping in Mom's room? Where else? In your room? You mean to say? Your mom is a full-time flirt. She's now a certified slut. As of now, your mother is sleeping around. Guys, please. Your mother deserves to be happy. What do you mean? You're not the only one who has the right to be happy. You find this funny, Migo? Don't butt in! I'm just kidding. Kat, tell us what's really the problem? If your mom is dating, what's the problem with that? I don't have a problem with her dating. But to let that guy sleep over at our place? How long have your parents been separated? Besides, they're annulled. Your mother is old enough to date around. Agree. First of all, who is this man? I don't even know him. I'll beat you up! Sorry, sorry! And what does he need from my mom? Maybe the Korean is really in love with your mother. That's right. My mom is in her fifties. So what? She's no longer desirable? You're disgusting, Migo! You're being unfair to your mom. I don't want to talk to you guys anymore! She's only in her fifties! Your mom's not here. She went out with Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim? Tell me, who is this Mr. Kim? Your mom's Korean friend. Since when did they become friends? Just recently. Is it true that she lets that guy sleep over? If they're staying in, they spend all afternoon here at the house. Especially during the weekends. What? Let's head back to the office? Wait! I still haven't gotten myself together. I want to kill someone! Don't let her know we're here. Okay, ma'am. Where's Mom? Make it quick. What are we doing here? Why don't you just talk to your mom? Will you just keep quiet? We're not yet on speaking terms. You're getting on my nerves. Teresing! Oh, my god! What happened to your mom? Ma'am? Clean my room and spray it all over with perfume. And order a bunch of scented candles. Okay. Bye. You two need to talk so you can clear up any misunderstanding. Grandmommy, I'm ready to talk to her. But I'm not sure about her. What is this? Did Mom buy a new car? Ma'am Fenny. Is Ella home? Yes. Whose car is this? Is that man inside? Yes. Where's Mom? Is he in Ella's room? What? Kat, wait for me! Let me handle this. I want to talk to her. Just stay calm. Ella? Ella? It's your mother. Ella, please open the door. Grandmommy, move over. Ella, I know you're in there. Ella? Grandmommy! Ella! Open the door! What are you doing... Mom! My gosh. Why? What do you mean why? Let me ask a better question. What are you doing inside? Who are these people? Won't you introduce us to your new friend? Oh, yeah. Why didn't you tell me? Good evening, mommy. Daughter. Please, come inside. Later. Really? Mom, can we talk in private? Yeah, sure. Let me change. Yes, please. Go change. You can change later. You're making me excited. Stop it! You bit my lips. I'll bite you too! Come over here! Mom! What's taking her so long? She's enjoying her time with that Korean. So, what's your issue now? Mom, what the heck are you doing? What is that scumbag doing in your room? Mom, you let the scumbag in your room. And you're letting him sleep here. Now you're asking me, what's my problem? What's the problem? You're sleeping in that moron's place. Now you're mad at me because I'm doing the same thing? You're mad at something I was also mad at? Your sentences are confusing me. Ma, those are questions. Ma, my situation is different. I'm 22 going on 23. You're... I didn't know a woman's happiness had an expiration date. A woman's happiness? Your mom's so shameless! I can't take this anymore! Katya, what do you think of me? A battery that has run out of juice? For your information, a battery can be recharged. Just plug it into an outlet or power bank. Is that how you see your boyfriend? Power bank? He's not my boyfriend. He's too young for me. And I don't intend to be called a cougar. He's not your boyfriend? You're letting him sleep in your room. So what do you call that? Fuck buddy! F-U-B-U! What did she say? Grandmommy, I'll explain it some other time. Mom, what's the matter with you? Your fuck buddy's here, Marinella. Babe? Thank you very much. My child, study hard. Mommy, don't forget to take your vitamins. And drink plenty of water to avoid hypertension. I need to go. Oh, what's this? Mommy, take care. Daughter, take care of your mom. Go ahead, babe. Can I have one more kiss? The other cheek. Oh, my God. Bye-bye. Ma, ask him to leave. Babe? Really? Yes, you heard it right. Yuck! Mom, why are you doing this? Grandmommy was right. Ma, I knew this came from you. You're such a gossipmonger. Me? A gossipmonger? Excuse me, I'm just well-informed. I'm tired. Go home. We have nothing to talk about. Mom, hold up! Are you doing this to get back at me? Maybe Kat's just worried because… because she doesn't know your fuck buddy yet. You just saw him and judged him right away. Wow! You did the same thing to Migo! So you're getting back at me? Mom, are you really happy with that scumbag? Aren't you happy when you're with that moron? How well do you know Papa J for you to judge him like that? You don't know Migo well enough to degrade him. Fine! That makes us even! You two are annoying, go home. Bye! Mom! It's way too early for work. I need to finish this. Let's talk later. Leave me alone. You're not going to eat? I have no appetite. So your mom's fuck buddy is rich? Apparently, he has a chain of bakeries in Korea. He has branches in Tokyo, Osaka, and Taiwan. So what's the problem? It feels like your mom won the lottery. Bern, that's not my point. My issue is, she decided to flirt around at her age. What do you mean all alone? I didn't abandon my mom. I'm still here. But where is she in your life? They're disgusting together! Kat, you're the only one who's disgusted. Let them be happy. Have you heard what your mother has been doing? How come every time we meet you have bad news? Fine, I won't tell! Come on, tell me! Please! Your mom went on an out-of-town trip with Mr. Korea. Off to Boracay. So why did she go to the beach with that creature? Maybe now she does not hate the beach. Actually, I'm quite offended by her. I've been inviting her to go to the beach with me. I told her… But she always says, "I hate the beach". Okay, that's enough. Yeah, so that's it. Mom! So what breaking news did my mother feed you now? I'm not here to confront you. I just want to clarify something. Same thing. Is it true... Yes, it's true. Jae-ho and I went to Boracay. Mom, I'm not done. That's why you came here, right? Don't you know... Yes, I know. I'm sure of it. Can you let me finish my question... You're just going to ask me if I'm sure about what I'm doing, because I go on dates with my Korean fuck buddy and we go out dancing in the disco. Disco? That's so old-fashioned. We call it club nowadays. Same thing! All I know is, I enjoy drinking margaritas, mojitos. Bar hopping. Banana boats. And soon, spelunking. Spelunking? You? I want to experience it. Mom, why are you doing this? Because I want to! Am I the reason you're acting this way? Not everything in my life is about you. And not everything in your life is about me. Still washing the dishes this late? If I don't clean, the rats and roaches might move in with us. Migo. The ants are already here. You know how busy I am. I wasn't able to clean up because I woke up late. Well, I guess I'm not busy. I just got back from the studio. Where were you? Work. Where else? At my mom's house. There you go. So you fought with your mom again. What? I realized something since we moved in together. You know what it is? I get to see and talk to you less and less. Because, all the time, you're concerned about how you'll torture your mom. What do you mean? Don't approach it head-on. You two should talk this out. You need to talk properly. You both don't need to be hot-tempered. Migo, are you serious? You might have forgotten why we fought in the first place. Because I moved in with you. So now it's my fault why your mom is flirting around? Unbelievable! Kat. I asked you. You made a decision to live here with me. Will you drop it already? I'm already here with you. What more do you want from me? Then what were you implying a while ago? I'm just telling the truth. What about the things you said before? Are you regretting your decision now? Kat, are you regretting your decision now? Kat, I'm still talking to you! Why are you making me choose? She's my mom! Yes, I love you. Migo, please. What? Why? Did you move in with me, just to get away from your mom? Is that right? Now that she has a boyfriend, you don't approve of it. And I'm to blame for that? Kat, if you want to go home, I can't do anything about it. I don't pressure people to do something against their will. And Kat, I'm not making you choose between me or your mom. But I'm going to ask it anyway. Of course. But? Bern, if you love someone… Who's making you choose? You're doing it to yourself. It's not your mom or Migo. Katya? What are you doing here? Grandmommy. Can I stay here with you? Katya. What did you and Migo fight about? I'm not sure if my sacrifices are worth spending the rest of my life with him. I want to share something with you. Your mother knows this, too. Marriage is not a happy ending. Two people signing a union is a tragedy. I just put up with your grandpa. Your grandpa is a nutjob. But he met his match with me. I didn't let him get away with his foolishness. So what happened, Grandmommy? I buried him in Parañaque. He's now a fertilizer. But your grandma is still here. Still traveling. Going on cruises. Doing Zumba, Yoga, Pilates. So who's the winner, huh? Last one. Honey. Right? Ella, you have a call. Let me guess. It's my mother. But she says Katya has a problem. What are your plans? What? Fuck buddy? Fuck buddy? Have you spoken to her? She will come home tomorrow. I'll have the driver pick her up. Let her make her own decision. Don't meddle too much. Okay. I'll go ahead. Hold on. Mother-daughter, private. Just me? I may be able to help. He's okay. Who? Your boyfriend. He looks like a whiteboard. But he's smart… and very rich. You think I'll get myself a lowlife? I already had that before. True that. You're getting older by the day. To use a chicken stew analogy, you might have to boil the meat for two hours. So hurry up. He may change his mind. Don't make him wait. Go ahead! Bye, Ma. Tell him to call me tomorrow. Thank you. What do you mean she has changed? Maybe she's just heartbroken. I'm worried. She's not eating. She's always locked up in her room. Does she go to work? Yes. But she comes home late from work. Then she wakes up very early. Maybe that's how she copes. You should take her out. Agree. Agree. Daddy J and I always try to invite her with us. Daddy J? Yes, Daddy J. Yeah, right. Daddy J! Your Uncle J is inviting us to Tagaytay. Let's eat there. You go ahead, thank you. I still have work to do. Katya. You're burnt out from work. Do you remember Florence's granddaughter? Chuchay? That's exactly what happened to her. Stressed out and overworked. Look what happened to her. Grandmommy, Chuchay is bipolar. Four attempted suicides are not on my itinerary. Of course, I know that. I know. We can both relax. You can meet some Europeans. Please, stop it already. Maybe Katya needs professional help. What kind of professional help? Psychiatrist? Maybe she has depression. Watch your mouth. Insanity doesn't run in our blood. What's wrong with your faces? Nothing. Nothing. It's that moron! Who? Can I talk to you? Come with me to your Mamita's party. I don't have a companion. Can't you just ask Mom? Your mother went out with her fuck buddy. I still have a lot of work to finish. Don't use your work as an excuse. I'm only asking you this one time. Are you going to turn me down? Of course not. I'll go change. Even 45 minutes. Just make yourself super beautiful. Why do I have to be super beautiful? It's not my birthday. We both have to be beautiful. Okay, sure. This is a nice place, Grandmommy. I am Josefina Lavides. Fenny Lavides. Have the guests arrived? How many guests does Mamita Ruby have? It seems like a lot. Mom. Bernice. What are you doing here? Someone wants to talk to you. Come with me. Me? Yes. Who? Just trust me. Mom, what's going on? This is it, surprise! Calm down. What's going on? Just wait. Migo? You left this behind when you decided to leave me. I went here to offer you this one last time. Migo, what are you doing? Kat. Katya, answer the question! Ma'am, they're here. My great-grandchild is here! Say hi to Grandmommy. She has beautiful lashes. Oh, my gosh! Amanda is so beautiful! Of course. Ma, her name is Chloe. What? My daughter's name is Michelle. Amanda is a beautiful name, just like my mother's. Ma, Amanda sounds too fierce. It should be soft, like Chloe. I'm the mother of the child. So her name is Michelle. It must be Amanda. Otherwise, forget it. Her name should sound fancy. Amanda. Name of nobility. Her name should befit a beauty queen. Like Gloria Diaz or Chloe. What do you mean, forget it? Besides, her name is already on the birth certificate.
