[music playing] I'm glad you came over. I wasn't sure where things stood with us anymore. What's that supposed to mean? Well, the things you said to me last time I saw you. It made me feel like you didn't believe in me anymore. Should I believe in you, Stephen? Yeah, you should. Otherwise, what's the point? You know, don't you? [gunshots] And now take a good look around. Statistics tell us that of this class of 22, five of you will become exemplary police officers. Nine more will stick it out and collect a pension. The remaining eight will find it too tough and you'll wash out. If you want to become one of the best, it's your humanity which will set you apart. Just remember that you are now members of a police department which is 50 years older than the Constitution of the United States. Serve it with pride. [cheering] Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Hey. Hey, darling. Look at this stray I found here. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, have you seen the kids around? Yeah, they're running around somewhere. Are they embarrassing me? Oh, yeah. So where are your folks, Stephen? Probably playing golf. Stephen's parents aren't too thrilled with his career choice. Here, have something to eat. She's beautiful and she can cook. Ah, don't try to charm me, Stephen Smith. STEPHEN: No, ma'am. So you boys looked mighty handsome up there. Honey, you are looking at two of San Antonio's finest. You anxious to get started? So long as I don't have to patrol the neighborhood I grew up in. It wouldn't be so bad. In Alamo Heights, a cop is a public servant. In the South Side, a cop can be somebody. Command respect. Come on. Look, I told you I don't know, man. I already volunteered, Farrell. If we're gonna be on this job for 30 years, I want it to mean something. Don't you? Yeah, but I've got a family to think about. Are you with me on this? [soft music] Well, it's official now. My life is one long string of cops. Grandaddy and daddy. Uncle, cousin. And husband. And probably one day my son. Little rookie Jimmy Dean. So congratulations, Officer. Well, thank you, ma'am. Farrell. FARRELL: Hmm? What did Stephen talk you into today? Well, he didn't exactly twist my arm. I don't want to spend my time patrolling shopping malls in Alamo Heights. Doesn't sound so bad to me. I want something a little more than that. You don't have to go looking for trouble. Well, if I'm gonna do it, I want to do it right. Oh, I see. And Stephen thinks doing it right is doing it on the South Side. Oh, yeah, sure. And he's right. And we're going to back each other up, we're going to keep each other out of trouble, and we're always going to be in each other's corner. Smith and Tucker. And I'm wanna tell you what, that sounds like a bad weapon, doesn't it? [laughing] [sirens blaring] All right, everybody back. [crying] They just kept shooting. Where? Show me. Show me. Show me. [crying] They just kept shooting. Shooting each other to pieces! They wouldn't stop! They wouldn't stop! Got enough weapons there, Guerrero? Mama raised me nervous. [country music] Ah. So I'm off on a horse. The guy who runs the stable starts yelling at him. Boom, I'm off after this perpetrator. Lone Ranger And I'm getting it too. I'm getting it. I drew, aimed, ping! From a gallop, I shot his horse right in the ass. I swear, the perpetrator got thrown 30 feet. Broke his neck in two places. Dead all over. Man, that's the way you have to do it. Improvise. Do what you gotta do and let God decide. Were you ever reviewed for improper use of your weapon, Captain? What, are you kidding? In case you haven't noticed, Smith, you're not in the academy anymore. Basic rules, my butt. We are the line of demarcation between what happens or doesn't. The man's right, buddy. We cruise alone out there. It's every man for himself. Ask Joey Miller's wife. She got his folded flag last week. Joey Miller died because he didn't stay current. He hardly ever went to the range. Oh, right. The range. Target practice. What the hell do you know about bad guys, Smitty? Huh? Alamo Heights, the cocktail capital of San Antonio. What crimes do you ever see except your neighbors cheating on their taxes? Lay off, Frank. Aw. You want to hear something, Smitty? [shouting on tape] That's me doing sound effects. FRANK (ON TAPE): Come on, get up! MAN (ON TAPE): [yelling] FRANK (ON TAPE): Don't make me hurt you! MAN (ON TAPE): [yelling] Stop, please! FRANK (ON TAPE): So talk! Come on! And you call that doing your job. You call that being right with your badge, beating somebody to death. Well, no one killed no one. Do I look like an amateur? Let's say I had. Trash like that, it'd be considered misdemeanor murder. And you know something else, Smith? It'd stay on the street. It wouldn't bother nobody upstairs. What goes down on the street stays on the street. [clearing throat] Come on, Frank. Your old lady's waiting up for me. Hell, I know that's a lie. She don't even wait up for me. Bye bye, Smitty. You know, Shifton is the kind of cop that give rednecks a bad name. No, he's got a point though. Now, when it comes down to it, it's either us or them out there. You cannot be buying into that garbage, Farrell. No, I just had a bad day. DISPATCH (ON RADIO): At 5th and Grand, a 4 59. Please respond. 2 6, I've got it. [siren blaring] Must have fallen asleep watching television. I-- I guess I didn't lock the door. What did he take? I don't know. Nothing. Did you hear him and wake up? [sighing] Did you get a look at him? Lucinda, I can't help you unless you answer my questions. [crying] He raped me. I'm sorry, Lucinda. I'm really sorry. Can you identify him? I know him from work. What's his name? Where's he live? Please don't tell my father! Don't tell my father! [crying] [banging] I'm looking for Edward Burkett. Is he home? No, is there some kind of trouble, Officer? Do you know where he's at? He's not home. Mind if I have a look around? Are you Burkett? You can't barge in here, man. You're under arrest for sexual assault. You have the right to remain silent. If you choose to give up that right-- You crazy, man. You messed up good. You're a big man, Eddie. You're a real big man. It takes a big man to do what you did. I didn't do nothing. She begged me to do it. I was doing her a favor. You messed up good, man. I ain't even gonna need a lawyer on this one. Well, I got me a witness. Ain't that right, Ma? Let's go. You break into his home without a warrant, then you conduct an illegal interrogation, and then you strike a handcuffed suspect while his mother looks on. My god, Smith. Do you have a screw loose? He baited me, sir. That's because he knows the law better than you do. Will he walk, sir? Will he walk. Are you kidding? He's already back out on the street! I'm very sorry, sir. Well-- well, I can sincerely believe that. Thank you, sir. But, Smith, I want you to know that I've got enough cowboys out on the street as it is. I don't need another one. Yes, sir. What did he say? I'm on probation. So you're still on patrol. It could have been worse. I'm on probation, and Eddie Burkett, who is guilty as sin, is a free man! Well. Maybe in God's eyes he's guilty. But a man ain't guilty till a jury says he is. 3-2, crowded plate. Go ahead, whiff it on by her-- oh, god! Strike three. She is out, gone, goodbye. So, Stephen, when are you going to find yourself some nice gal and get married and have some kids of your own? Oh, I'll know her when I see her. Every day, every other street corner I say to myself, today I'm going to arrest her and I'm going to know she's the one. Don't you talk that way. There's one fact that still eludes you about women, honcho. STEPHEN: I'm sure you're gonna enlighten me, partner. Most of 'em like furniture. Oh, Stephen. Do you still only have a-- a bed and a table? Own not, want not. You're on a long and lonely road, buddy. You better buy some lamps before it's too late. Take this home with you and call it a starter set. FARRELL: No, no, no, no, not my favorite chair. Look at him. You call it. Draw. [gunshots] Damn, don't you ever get rusty? Wearing a badge is the best job in the world, but it don't mean diddly if you're dead. Which reminds me, partner. I've seen you come off your shift without your vest on. I sweat like a pig in that thing. All right. This time you're gonna do it with your ticket book in your hand. [chuckling] No, go ahead, hot shot. I'll time you. On the gun. [gunshots] 1.9 seconds. Pretty damn good shooting, buddy. [glass shattering] Hurry up! Hurry up! What's going on? They're killing each other! You gotta stop 'em, please! Hurry! Ma'am, I want you to calm yourself down. I'll take care of the problem. [shouting] WOMAN: Stop it! All right, break it up. [shouting] Break it up, I said. [grunting] Gentlemen, break it up. We're gonna settle this in a civilized fashion. [shouting] I said break it up! [glass shattering] WOMAN: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Horton, give me that right now! Give me that! Stop it! Stop it, no! You're killing him! You wanna kill a cop? Get away! Come on, get off. [doorbell ringing] BETH: Farrell, will you get that? Yeah. Hey-- what the hell happened to you, man? Were you in a wreck? Domestic dispute. Come in. Do you want a drink or something? No, I'm full of painkiller. I had to come here. I wanted you to hear this from me. Domestic dispute. What are you talking about? They were animals. They didn't give a damn that I was a cop. Farrell. The got my gun. They took your weapon? A domestic dispute? What the hell did we become cops for? You take an oath, you put your life on the line for what? Marriage counseling! Hey, hey. Look at this! STEPHEN: Take it easy, partner. No, the hell I will. Am I wrong, or shouldn't you be a little PO about this? You're not wrong. [game beeping] - Good shot. Good shot. Good shot. Oh. [laughing] You missed. You missed. I think he's just Superman! LEA: Food's ready. Good shot. [laughing] STEPHEN: All right, all right. OK. Why do you all come in here at 8:00? You never been in here before. Oh, you know, we usually eat doughnuts. But, uh, my partner here, he saw you through the window. Once he got a look at you, well, I couldn't keep him away. Well, if he come in here to see me, he ain't made much point of it. Well, you see, he's very shy. And he was sort of hoping that you would, um, break the ice. LEA: Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Ka-boom! Hmm. No better kick in the butt than watching those little cowboys fall. Oh, damn. [laughing] Let's see, uh, could you get me some napkins? I think she's got some napkins up there. You know, if you'd slow down, that wouldn't happen, Farrell. Can I get some napkins, please? You bet. Here you go. I hope these will be enough. For Sloppy Joe over there, I don't know. Is there something else, Officer? Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude. Uh, if I'm on the wrong track, you just set me straight. But do I remind you of somebody? No. Are you somebody? Stephen. Hey, would you bring me some napkins over here, please? Oh, you're a Stephen. Uh-huh. [laughing] MAN: A large soda and an extra mashed potatoes. OK, sir. That's a two-piece chicken dinner, side of slaw, extra mashed potatoes, large Coke, and a fried-- [gun cocking] Up! [woman screaming] Shut up! - Hey, man. Take it easy, all right. You can have whatever cash we have, OK? Just take it easy. In here, now. Now! You too. OK. [woman crying] OK, OK. Don't push. Take it easy. I think he-- I think he went around back. Smitty, perp's coming out the back. Down! You in the coat, stop! Police officer. Stop! It's not me, man. Drop what you're holding. Clasp your hands behind your head. Clasp your hands behind your head! [gunshots] Right back here. [police radio chatter] Close up. [siren blaring] Patrolman Smith. I'm Detective Sergeant Nicholas, Homicide. Yes, sir. How are you doing? I'm doing all right, sir. Patrolman Castro tells me that you fired all six shots. That's right, sir. Well, you hit him with five. That's pretty good shooting. He didn't seem to want to go down, sir. Now, why don't you go on home? You can finish your report in the morning. I'm gonna need your gun. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. I talked to the manager and it definitely sounds like a right to shoot. That's good. How's Smith? Hanging pretty tough for a guy who just lost his cherry. Patrol, this is 10 Henry 4. Hey, a blanket out of the car. Stephen, you all right? Yeah, I think so. I think. I mean, Farrell, I can't even remember too much of what happened. Castro and a civilian witness are saying that it was a justifiable shooting. Damn right. Empty your gun. Now, you did what you had to do, Stephen. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, I did. In the, uh, past year, there were 190 murders in San Antonio. That's an increase of more than 25% over last year. We keep our own statistics, Ms. Burroughs. Well, in that same period, there were at least 40 formal complaints of police brutality and 12 confirmed shootings of civilians by San Antonio police officers. I told your editor that I would answer some questions. Do you have any questions, ma'am? Well, I-- I have to question whether the police force is making things better or worse. Uh, Ms. Burroughs. Where are you from? New York City. Does it matter? Well, New York is a vertical city. San Antonio is a horizontal city. And it's a huge area for a relatively small police force to patrol. Well, it's very simple. If the taxpayers are willing to give us enough money to blanket the street with patrolmen, we'll cut down on the violence substantially. But I don't think that's going to happen. So we do the best dang job we can do with the resources we have. Well, what about the police shootings? Our sources tell us that patrolmen are carrying caches of their own weapons around. If a police officer is caught with unauthorized weapons in a department vehicle, the first time he-- he or she will be reprimanded. The next time, he or she will be suspended. That is department policy. I am not going to let San Antonio become Dodge City. Well, there's nothing like a good love story. That's right, a man and his gun. Is that really what it's like to be a cop? Oh, no way. Mostly we find lost kids and we feed them ice cream cones. Officer, I think these people were jaywalking. Freeze! Get in the car. See, when you're old married folks, you gotta open your own doors. What do you mean married? Oh, you. Take it easy back there. I'm watching you. I want to see two pairs of hands at all times. Ooh. Well, Officer, is that a gun, or you just enjoy my company? [laughing] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You keep your eyes on the road there, partner. I can't drive with you all over him like that. [grunting] [sirens approaching] Keep your mouth shut, old man. Thanks for the loan. All right, everything's going to be all right. You're going to be all right. I want you to just think now, OK? And I want you to try to tell me what he looks like. 2 6. 2 4, go to channel eight. STEPHEN (ON RADIO): Nothing here. Why don't you do-si-do up my way, kemosabe? STEPHEN (ON RADIO): And where might that be? I'm in South Military. Looks like we got ourselves a winner, buddy. Just hold on a second. I want to talk to you. You, uh, got a warrant or something? How about you got an ID or something? Listen, man. You can't just stop the citizen in the street. That's a nice brown jacket. Expensive. Turquoise earring, very hard to forget. Now, let's see the ID right now. Take it out. [laughing] Spread 'em! Put your hands behind your back! I said put them behind your back, right now! Come on, boy, now! PERP: Show me how tough you are. I ain't fooling with you! Put 'em back! You showed that old man how tough you are, didn't you? Didn't you! What do I know about old men? [laughing] Farrell. Let's go. Don't stink up the upholstery. They aren't guilty till a jury says they are, partner. [murmuring] Hello, Officer Smith. I'm Janet Burroughs from "The San Antonio Star." Pleased to meet you, Ms. Burroughs. Oh, my. Will Ms. ever catch on in Texas? I surely hope not, ma'am. What's up? That officer up there is my partner. He nailed that gentleman sitting over there with his lawyer after he beat an old man half to death for 6 bucks. And? Well, we're all hoping there's justice in this world. Aren't we, Ms. Burroughs? Your Honor, the People respectfully request a 30-day continuance. Objection, Your Honor. We're ready to proceed. What is the People's problem? You've had two continuances already. Well, Judge, our victim is a 74-year-old man who's afraid of reprisals. Now, we haven't been able to find him and think he may have fled the state. Well, can you proceed without him? No, we need his testimony. I think the old guy's just running scared, Your Honor. Well, I'm sorry, but if you can't find your witness I have no choice. Case dismissed. [murmuring] You are free. You're brilliant, man. You're brilliant. Don't threaten me, pig. I got witnesses. Well, go on, while my lawyer's here. Go ahead and say something. We'll be seeing you again real soon, sonny. BAILIFF: Next case. Docket number 4859, T. R. Brunell. Draw. [gunshots] You're getting better, Farrell. Well, beating you is what keeps me going. That's a cute puppy. Stephen told us you loved animals. Yeah, you bet. Ever heard of a man giving his fiancee a puppy for an engagement present? Isn't that the cutest thing you've ever heard of? My, you have brought out a whole new side of that man. Yeah. Beth? - Mm-hm? Honey, can I be perfectly honest with you? Oh, you don't ask me that. Well, gotta confess as the wedding gets a little closer. I'm a little nervous. I mean, you know, I ain't marrying a schoolteacher or nothing. That's for damn sure. Yeah. So? I mean, what's it like? Oh, well. Uh-- it's not the same as it was for my mama. Ferrell has to deal with a whole different world that my daddy did. The violence has gotten worse. And it used to be a cop was respected. Now he's killed. It's harder. Now it takes its toll. Sometimes Stephen will come home with that, but I know you can handle it. I hope so. You fell in love with a man who wants to make a difference. And there'll be times when you'll be lying in bed wondering what he's doing, thinking the worst. But you just gotta replace those thoughts with pleasanter ones. Know what my mama told me? To try to think of movies with happy endings. [suspenseful music] [gunshots] Oh, god! Please, please don't kill me! Please, please, don't kill me! Please don't kill me! I'm gonna die! Another one of our, uh, upstanding citizens, a B and E repeater by the name of, uh, Bobby Lee Duke got his house shot up last night. I understand Bobby Lee suffered some property damage. He buy the ranch? Nope, but he sure was in need of some clean underwear. [laughter] That's a third vigilante style shooting this last month. It doesn't make us look too good. Well, you're right. Whoever it was should've wasted the little weasel. One last thing, compadres. Chief's on the warpath about unauthorized weapons. You get caught holding, you're off the street, you're behind a desk. Is that clear? Sergeant Guerrero, do you mean to tell us that officers of the law are in possession of illegal weapons? [laughter] That'll be all. Watch your butts out there. Do they make that wig for men, Guerrero? [laughter] Man, this town's getting crazier. Old Bobby Lee's house got hit with automatic weapon fire. You mean even the geeks got primo weapons? Them Dowads always going to be knocking each other off out there. What do I care what kind of guns they use? Well, I care what kind of guns they use, Farrell. There's a war going on out there. I want to know how they're packing. Man, if they want to take each other out, why should we lose sleep over it? Works for me. - Works for me. [upbeat music and chatter] Oh, honey. When you get your vacation, we can take our honeymoon! Can we go to New Orleans? OK. Oh, baby, yeah! I've never been there before. - My god, Farrell. You'd think at least his folks would come to their son's wedding. Oh, well, he doesn't talk about it that much. I mean, you know, it's bad enough he became a cop. Worse that he works on the South Side. And now he's gone and married into it. Oh, baby, it's gonna be so great. Shoot, I never been out of Marin County! [laughing] OK, Maggie. Come on, now. How many daughters you got getting married today? I think you owe us one. We near a speech. Come on. - Oh, no, shoot. - Come on, Maggie, Come on, Mama. Don't be shy. [laughter] I don't have any words. Well, that's a first, Mama. All right, hush your mouth. [laughter] Well, I'm sure I just feel like every momma does at a time like this, you know. I'm just happy and I'm sand. I'm sad because my baby's going away. Oh, god. Mama, don't make a scene. Well, I'm happy too. Because she's gone and found herself someone who's responsible and strong and with great buns. [laughter] Shoot. I'll drink to that. Oh, no you wont. [chatter] Mama, wake up. Aw, honey. My wife works at City Hall and the word is that the chief is starting to take heat over all them shoot 'em ups. You gotta admit, it's pretty wild. One sleazebag called in to report a car bomb. Of course he forgot he stole the car. [laughter] Got his self arrested. Bad guys blast each other away, the courts get clearer, the taxpayers save a buck. Self-containment. I say let's have more of it. Some people just abdicate their right to suck air. [laughter] There you go. Welcome to the cop club, boys. And congratulations. FARRELL: For what? Well it only took you three years to get the right attitude. [laughter] Well, hey, we've all been through a lot of changes since we first put on this badge. And guess what? There's gonna be a lot more before we retire. Um. Here's to my partner and to the brother I never had. I want you to have a long life and a happy marriage. There you go. There you go, Smitty. Yeah. [laughter] Ooh! Honest to goodness, you don't realize how much junk you've got until you've gotta move it all. Ain't that the truth? That's never been one of my problems. Well, I'm gonna give half this stuff away, no doubt about it. Maybe keep some of it in Mama's garage. Except for that green vase. There's no argument here. [gunshots] Just a little after 2100 hours. We were packing things in my wife's apartment when I heard the volley of shots. I came down here to investigate, and I found the victim already laying dead in the parking lot. Thanks, Stephen. Officer Smith. Ray Nicholas. I remember. You were the first one on the scene? That's right. Did you see anything? Just the alleged victim already dead. Alleged victim? I can't get real worked up over a dead car thief, Sergeant. Look at that shot group. We found shell casings from a .45 up on the bridge there. That's 60 yards away through a chain link fence. You could fit both those shots in a 10 ring. [siren blaring] Hmm. Not much to go on. That's some shooting. Officer Tucker? Yeah. I'm Detective Sergeant Nicholas. This is Detective Sergeant Arquette. How you doing? What's this all about? You want to come inside? No, thanks. Do you know anything about the shooting tonight? - Which one? - Two-bit burglar. Some kid stealing a car stereo. Your partner Smith was right there. Oh, where was it at? 19th and San Geronimo. Oh, that's his wife's place. You know, he just got married. What's the point? You and Smith do a lot of target practice, don't you, Tucker? Yeah. Yeah, we shoot a little. What about it? NICHOLAS; How good a shot is Smith? He's good. So am I. Well, are you good enough to crank off three rounds from a distance of 60 yards at night and hit a man three times through a chain link fence? Yeah, sure, if you give me a rifle and a scope. How about a pistol? This is ridiculous. Stephen's off-duty when a shooting goes down. He calls it in, stays on the scene. He does what he's supposed to do, am I right? You want to know anything else, you ask him yourself. Now may I go in to my family, Sergeants? NICHOLAS: Yeah, Tucker. Yeah, thanks. I sure rather would be playing more than just a hunch. [sighs] Yeah, but the question is, do you want your hunch to be right? [clearing throat] Farrell, what are you doing here? Come over here, check this out. I need to talk to you. OK. Thank you. Is there a problem? You're a suspect in the Terry Folsom shooting. Oh, come on. That's crazy. Whoever's saying that, I can't believe that, Farrell. I think they're fishing. I mean, if they had anything, you know, they'd charge you. Stephen, did you say anything that might have set him off? Anything-- No. No way. No, I gave them the facts, same as if it was my report. This is just crazy, Farrell. I know. It's all these shootings. It's just got everybody going. It's getting everybody. You know, I didn't have to become a cop. I chose this job. My father wanted me to stay in college and become a lawyer, but I did not need some half-baked legal system to tell me what's right and what's wrong. They're messing with the wrong guy, Farrell. Oh. Come in, Tucker. Have a seat. Chief, I want to thank you for seeing me. Well, what's on your mind? Well, I'm sure I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know, but Stephen Smith is a suspect in the shooting of a burglary the other night. And you disagree. Yes, Chief, I surely do. Now, anyone who knows Stephen knows that what these detectives are suggesting is impossible. HOGAN: Now look-- No, sir. Now, if what they told me is all they've got, then they are risking a man's career because they're under some kind of political pressure. Officer, I hope you're not suggesting that this department is looking for some sort of a scapegoat. Sir, all I am asking for here is a little fairness. Now, all they've got out there right now are stories. And there are stories about every patrolman in this department. There are stories about me, and I'm sure there were stories about you when you were in uniform too. Now, you hold it right there. That's enough. I'll be the judge of whether or not an investigation is being conducted properly. Is that clear? Is that clear? Yes, sir. Then you're dismissed, Tucker. Hey, loose lips. You talking to me, Frank? Word is you went to the chief for your buddy buddy. Is that true? That's true enough, not that it's any of your business. Nice move, Tucker. Guess what list you just went the top of? Listen, Frank, why don't you get to the point, huh? Chances are Internal Affairs will stay out of this unless someone like you is in there stirring things up. Then we run the risk of a rogue cop being put on public display. A rogue cop? How can you complain about a rogue cop in this department shift? And when was the last time you played by departmental rules, huh? You still got that little tape recorder with you, huh? Come on, Farrell. Nobody thinks Smith is guilty, OK? It's a bum rap. Well, is that right or isn't it? Just say it. All right then. You keep your mouth shut or I'll shut it for you. Any heat your sweetheart takes better not burn anybody else, bubba. [glass shattering] [grunting] Come on, guys, break up! Grab him! Grab him! Come on! Why are these guys so jumpy? Tucker broke the code when he came to you. Hmm. What do we got here? A trigger-happy cop. Maybe two. [shouting] Aw, check it out. Be cool. Must be lunchtime, otherwise you'd all be hard at work. Oh, but you are working, aren't you? All right, everybody, let's come up with some ID. Oh man. Man, we're just kicking back. We ain't doing nothing wrong at all. These ladies are so attractive, I'm gonna give them a screen test. Hey, man, what's this all about? Damn, man. Are you crazy? Say cheese. OK, you've got yourself three. That's it for you, man. This is no time to be shy. Wait, no! Look, just no picture. It ain't right. Since when does a punk like you decide what's right? Clinton Corey. Look, man, if I ain't under arrest, you can't take my picture. No! Maybe you got more to hide than just your face, Clinton. Look, man, you got family? You got kids? You take my picture, and maybe someday you won't. You just threatened an officer of the law, Clinton. No, man, I didn't say anything at all. Did y'all hear me say anything? WOMEN: Mm-mm. I didn't. OK, no screen test for you. But you're never going to get to be a star with that attitude, Clinton. Easy, partner. It's just me, class of '79. Hey. What are you doing sneaking around here? I want to talk to you. All right. I know what you've been doing. Going to the chief. Laying into Frank Shifton. But your my best buddy, and I don't want you getting fired over me. - Come on, Stephen. This is a bunch of bull. I can't just stand aside. No, that's what I want you to do. That's exactly what you have to do. I'm innocent. You're standing by the right guy. But let me ride it out, OK? I can handle it. It's my beef. And I can take care of myself. All right? All right? Farrell, don't make it harder on me, all right? All right. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. [suspenseful music] [explosions] [dogs barking] Oh! You go over to the Johnsons and call 911. Hurry, 911! Hurry, hurry! How you feel this morning, honey? Couldn't sleep again last night? Hi, sweetie. Hey. Hey, Marjorie, come on, honey. [doorbell ringing] Come on, Marjorie. Jimmy. Hey, Lea. Everything OK? What's the matter? Can I come in and talk to you for a minute? Well, sure, you bet. Come on in. BETH: Come on, kids. CHILDREN: Hi, Mrs. Smith. - Say bye, Mrs. Smith. - Bye! Bye, Ms. Smith. - Jimmy Dean. I love you. OK. Hurry up. You button up your jacket there. Hey, you want some coffee? No, thank you, Beth. FARRELL: Well, what's the matter? It's Stephen. He don't sleep much, Farrell. And sometimes a whole day goes by and he don't eat nothing. Well, he's under a lot of stress, and that can kill the appetite. It's-- it's like a whole wall goes up around him. He don't even know that I'm there. This investigation will be over soon. OK? He'll be cleared of all suspicion, and it'll just go away. What investigation? What are you talking about, Farrell? Well, he didn't tell you? The shooting in back of your apartment. You don't know anything about this? You're starting to scare me, Farrell. What are you talking about? Oh, sweetie. Sweetie. FARRELL: There is nothing to it, OK? Stephen is a suspect in a shooting. It's all political, Lea. - What? FARRELL: He didn't do a thing. He is innocent. Chief, can I get some quotes from you on the bombing of your house? Number on, no, you may not. Number two, how'd you get in here? I charmed my way past the duty officer. Now, why would anybody want to firebomb your house, sir? A police chief has natural enemies. Yes, but this crosses the line. Can you see how this looks to John Q. Texan? No, little lady, how did it look? Like the bad guys are winning. Gentlemen, we have ourselves an image problem. But it's one there's not going to be with us very long. This, uh, lady reporter says that she has taking the pulse of our community and that there is a growing tendency to view this department as a bunch of pistoleros. She further notes that the Chamber of Commerce wishes to stress that San Antonio is America's fastest growing city and not part of the Wild West. Now, gentlemen, we are going to pay heed to what's being said here. From now on, we play it strictly by the book. Then our problem is going to go away. I do hope that's clear. One more thing. As everybody here is aware, my home recently suffered an attack by persons unknown. I want you to know that my wife is fine. She's mad as hell, but she's fine. I'm here to ask each one of you to work extra hard and find out who did this to me. Thank you. All right. Any questions? Hey, Sarge. What's a pistolero? [laughter] GUERRERO: Let's hit the streets. DISPATCH (ON RADIO): We have a domestic complaint at 1 2 1 4 9 Grant, 2 6. Sounds like some guy's wailing on his old lady. 2 6, 10-4. Might need backup. What's the problem? I want that good for nothing out of the house! You get him out! All right, ma'am, just calm down. You tell us your name. Lucy Gorgon. And that-- that animal in there is Harold Sanders. I'll tell you what he did. He rammed his car into mine. He beat me up, he threw me out, and he locked the door! Hell, I pay half the rent here. Willing to press charges, Lucy? I ain't willing to press nothing. You just get him out of the house! All right, wait here. Listen, let's just talk to him. I don't think you should rip your new uniform if she ain't gonna follow through in court. [banging] You in there, Mr. Sanders? MR. SANDERS: You cops get out of here. This ain't none of your business! Yeah, just open up, sir. All we want to do is talk. MR. SANDERS: You want to side with that ho, you go ahead. She found out what a man can do, and so will anyone else who tries to get in, and that means you too! Stephen. Stephen. Look, he hit a car and took off. That's just hit and run. We call a tow truck, we'll impound his car. It'd cool his heels for a while. All right. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Big man when you got another guy backing you up. You get the hell off my property before I come out there and make you leave! Why don't you come out here, you gutless slug? What you say to me? What you say to me? You can't say that to me! Go on! You just keep walking out! And you, you get your ass down the road now! Go on! Move on! Go on, keep walking now! I'm tired of looking at you! I need help. My car's getting ripped up. No, don't send a cop! It's a cop that's doing it! Stephen. Hey, man. Hey! What the hell are you doing? I can't believe you! I can't believe you did this! Why not, Farrell? You heard him. Mr. Sanderson there is a man among men. A man of his caliber is going to have this all fixed up in no time. You should back off. I can handle it, all right? Look, is this how you handle it? Don't get bent, man. I thought you had more to you. Shut up, Farrell. Oh, you're just going to let him beat you down, aren't you? Until you're as bad as they are. This is your car, all right? You go ahead and take it. It's all yours. [tense music] [alarm clock buzzing] Farrell? Yeah? Can you listen to this? What? Listen to this. "San Antonio police officer was suspended yesterday after vandalizing the automobile of a suspect in a routine domestic dispute. Police Chief Hogan claiming that the officer, Stephen Smith, lost his cool." It says he took strong action as quote, "a demonstration of my intent as chief of this department to see to it that each and every officer of my force performs his duties strictly according to the book." End quote. Did you know about this? Yeah. Yeah, he blew it. I was there. I'd better go find him now. [chatter] Have you seen Stephen around? I don't know where he is, Farrell. I don't know what he does with his time. He's lost without his badge. [suspenseful music] [chatter] Who is it? What you want? Oh. Got your camera, cracker? Not quite. Not this time. [gunshot] Clinton Corey was a pimp who dabbled in running numbers. He could've had a million enemies. Is there a possible connection between the Corey shooting and any other vigilante shootings? That'd be a good story, but no hard evidence to support it. Clinton Corey was shot point blank by someone he probably did business with. Sergeant, can I talk to you? Janet, will you excuse us for a minute? Sure. I believe Smith's suspension is connected to that shooting outside his wife's apartment. And you guys are still after him on that, aren't you? You offering evidence, Tucker? That was a long time ago. If you guys had anything, you'd have charged him by now. It's tearing him to pieces, Sergeant. I'm doing my job, Tucker. If it'll make you feel any better, you're no longer a suspect. You guys are unbelievable, you know that? Let me tell you something. If you push Stephen Smith over the edge and come to find out that you're wrong, well then you're gonna have to come deal with me. All right, Nicholas? [country music] 9-inch barrel. Of course it's gonna be more accurate than a smaller barrel. The thing is, you got this here, and pointing it down-- Oh, right. Give me a double bourbon, Hank. Oh, Farrell! It's not even happy hour yet. Has anybody seen Stephen around? Uh, he wouldn't come in here. He's not exactly this month's cop centerfold. Hey! Now, Stephen is twice the cop any of us will ever be, and you know it. Maybe he is, OK. But if you care about your future on this force, you might just want to keep your nose out of it. Is that what you think too, Castro? Kevin's got a point, Farrell. You know, I got a pension to think about. It's so dangerous now, they've got the attendant in this bulletproof glass booth with no door. You've seen these in the self-service station, haven't you? Yeah? There's just a little hole to stick the money through. How does this guy get into this booth? [laughter] Daddy? Wanna have a fast wheels race? Uh-- uh, no, not tonight, pal, all right? When? Well, how about tomorrow night, OK? We'll play with it tomorrow night. - OK. - OK. Well, I'll just go set up the track anyway, in case you change your mind. All right, you go ahead and do that then. Plus, you might change your mind. Yeah, I-- I might. [phone ringing] Hello. Yeah. Hi, Lea. Yeah, wh-- OK, good. That's good. All right, let me-- let me talk to him, OK? Oh. Uh-- yeah, well, um-- well, at least he's home. OK. I'll see you later, then. Bye. Stephen got home. Oh. It's about time. And went straight to bed, Lea said. Well, maybe you should too, honey. You haven't been sleeping too well lately. You know, they're gonna hang Stephen out to dry. Just to show how hard they've been working to keep this town straight. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now he's gotta take the heat. Politics isn't who gets elected. Politics also says who gets eliminated. Politics are also temporary, Farrell. Nobody is on the top or on the bottom forever. Not if you're a cop that's going to jail. They want him for murder. And Stephen said he would rather die than go to jail. Officer Smith, you have been suspended not for defending yourself in any improper way but because you willfully destroyed private property. I'm fully aware that, sir. What I hope to do is look hard at the word willfully. The reason that I'm appealing the suspension is because I feel like I wasn't reacting to the situation that was occurring, but rather to the one that had happened before, the one that I was almost killed. I got it reversed, Farrell. All right. OK. And aren't you ashamed of yourself? Look, I didn't mean to-- Punching out your best buddy. All right, I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have. You see? You lost faith in me. I told you I'd handle it. I got half a chance when I'm not dealing with all that political garbage. Here's to the Civil Service Commission, who knows a great cop when they see one. Cheers. I second that. When y'all going back to work, Stephen? Tomorrow. And we are gonna stomp somebody, partner. The criminal elements in San Antonio will not sleep well tonight. Bet you're gonna be happy when he gets out of the house. Whatever makes you say that? You don't have to worry about Lea. She's a good old girl. She can take care of herself. Well, here's to getting back to normal. Hey, hey. [chatter] Michael Sturtevant. We meet again. They cut me loose, man. What do you want? Nothing. Just memories. Well, I don't even know who you are. Michael Sturtevant. Your specialty: assault on defenseless old men. MO: nighttime on foot. Home address: 13-- 13 something Vista Place. That is a soaring intellect you got. I'm a poet now. Did you know that? When life has been lived too long and the sun is low on the sky, we must take our place in the ground and cover the grave with flowers of evil. What you think? Got a shot at the Pulitzer? [suspenseful music] Michael Sturtevant. Professional punk and two-time loser. Third time's a charm. Judging from the trajectory, I'd say he was shot from the roof of that building over there. Whoever it is, he likes a challenge. - Farrell. - What? Going shooting out at the Grove tomorrow. You want to come along? Well, I've got a choice. I can keep buying ammunition, or I can make my house payments. Got a quarter? No. Did you hear another one went down last night? No, what? Remember that punk that wore the earring and liked to beat up on old men? Someone rid society of Michael Sturtevant last night. Hi, Janet. Thanks for coming. Hi. My curiosity is overwhelmed. Janet, what if I were to tell you that I think there's a connection between the sniper shootings of Terry Folsom and Michael Sturtevant and the point blank shooting of Clinton Corey? This is on the record? No. I believe strongly that the person who's committing these murders is carefully selecting his victims based on their criminal record. Now, if you're writing an article about this, I would also mention what a good shot this person is. How he can spray a house with automatic weapon fire and not hurt anybody. But when he wants to put someone down, he can do it from 60 yards with a pistol. Raymond. We're talking about someone who has access to criminal records and is a sharpshooter. Ray, are you telling me this person is a cop? I wouldn't tell you to walk away from that theory. Forgive my cynicism, but am I being set up here? Janet, Chief Hogan has asked me to use every means to apprehend this shooter, who is also most likely the man who firebombed the chief's house. And I am using every means, and you are one of them. [suspenseful music] [dog whimpering] Go on, get. Get! [dog barking] What did you do to her, you bastard? STEPHEN: I didn't do anything. Would you listen to her! The stupid dog was sniffing around my guns. I didn't want it to get hurt. You are such a liar! Don't you call me a liar! Oh, you're not a liar? Did you ever tell me about all the trouble you were in about what was happening to you? No. Farrell had to tell me. For one thing, it's none of your damn business. And for another thing, Farrell should keep his big mouth shut! Would you just listen to yourself, Stephen? Farrell is the only real friend you've got. I don't even know you anymore. I can't live like this. I cannot live like this! I can't take this anymore, Stephen! I'm leaving! No. No, you're not. You are not leaving me, Lea! I am not going to be attacked by everyone! You are staying right here! You listen up, girl. You listen up, girl! I am not gonna have you joining forces with everyone against me! What are you talking about? I don't know and I don't care! You're crazy, Stephen! Do you wanna know what I'm talking about? You wanna know what I'm talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. I'm gonna tell you a secret now, baby, that's gonna join us at the hip. Ah! What? Stephen, stop it! Stop! No! Stephen! No! No! [crying] I swear I was gonna pay for it! They didn't give me a chance. Next time you'll be more careful. [glass shattering] Dammit! Stop! Hey, man! Hey! Hey! Watch it! Oh! Put your hands behind your back! Ah! Ah, it's hurting, man! You all right? PERP: You're hurting me! Get up! I was about to pay, I swear! Oh, what, you're gonna cry for me? You're gonna cry for me, a big man like you? Break my heart, you gutless punk. I didn't do anything, I swear! - Shut up! - I didn't do anything! - Shut up! - I didn't! Ah! You want something to cry about? - I didn't do nothing! - Shut up! Take that! Take that! Take that, take that! Here! Take that! Take it like a man, huh! What's the matter, Officer? Have you forgotten how to take orders? The gun too. Sergeant, see to it that Officer Smith is booked on assault and battery. Man, I've never seen anything like this. Little old lady's complaint was you slapped around some shoplifter, and you get this? It's like the chief's gonna come down on you with both boots, man. Hey, Sarge. Chief tells me you're sending me a bad guy. Famous too. A real legend. Just book him, Frank. Paperwork will be sent down. Brutalizing the citizenry, huh. My, my. I thought you'd learn more than that at the academy. Indefinite suspension same as being fired. You're out of here. Drop dead, Shifton. What goes down on the street stays on the street. You forgot that rule. It's the only one you should never forget. Your buddy never should've gone to the chief. When you made Hogan eat his suspension, he just figured he'd wait for you to screw up. How didn't have to wait too long, did he? Take this guy against the wall. You know the routine. Side. [door buzzing] Farrell. Thank god. I knew I could count on you. Not you too. I don't know. I thought I was sure, but I don't know anymore. You're too out of control. No. That's where you're wrong. You gotta listen to me. They are doing everything they can to break me because I am too much in control. It's all political. They need somebody to take the fall. You want me to believe in you, then you answer me this question. You ask me anything. I'm your friend. I won't lie to you. Why didn't Lea leave you and why won't she talk about it? Or is that political too? No, of course it's not. She's a victim, just like I am. And the main reason I gotta get out of here is to talk to her. Stop dodging the question. Why'd she leave you? You want to know why she left me? - Yeah. - I'll tell you why she left me. Because she's weak. She's a frail, gentle woman. That's why I didn't tell her my troubles. Look what happened. As soon as I told her, she panicked, she ran. The strong have to protect the weak, Farrell. That's the truth. That's why I became a cop. All my life, everything I worked for, it's all gone. She's all I got left. I gotta get out of here so that I can talk to her. I spoke to the prosecutor. He's going to recommend that you be released on your own recognizance. [suspenseful music] [knocking] Open the door, Maggie. Stephen, don't you make me call the cops. I love her, Maggie. I'm not gonna hurt or. Now open the door. Come on. I won't say long. You're not gonna hit me again? No, I'm not gonna hit you. Lea. We're partners. And from now on, I'm gonna let you in on everything I do. You already told me too much. If Stephen takes advantage of his suspension to get therapy, well that's gotta work in his favor. Stephen would never go to a therapist. He's already whistled through several psychological evaluations. Honey, you should have seen the way he looked at me when he was in jail. I don't know. You know, it made me wonder. I didn't know him anymore. [car approaching] Tell me what happened. It don't matter what he might do to me. I gotta make myself right with God. Tell me. He did it. He's guilty. He killed them all. How do you know? Where's the proof? He hunts people like animals. He told me it's him who kills what's wrong with the world. It's him, Farrell. The killer cop. Where is he? Where is he right now? I don't know. But you better find him. He's not through, he's gonna kill again. Hogan's next. He firebombed his house. Now he's gonna kill the chief of police. Do we have any grounds at all to doubt her? Why would she lie, sir? There's no way to know what Stephen might do if he found out she came to me. Right. She doesn't have much of a motive with any of this, does she? Can we pull him in now? On what, a four-year-old shooting? Oh. A renegade cop. The media will lap this up. Every one of these shootings has been premeditated. If Smith has announced his plans to gun you down, then we have to think he's going to try. Yeah. But can we subpoena his wife before a grand jury and get her to tell her story again to them? Takes time to convene a grand jury, and we don't know a heck of a lot about Smith's timetable. Well, look, he's obviously nuts. Why can't we go to county mental health, get him committed, and hold him there until you can make your case against him? Because Stephen would make idiots out of those people. You remember the Civil Service Commission? He conned me, my wife, his wife. Stephen could lie his way straight out of hell. Tucker, are you willing to help us? What do you mean, wear a wire? It might work. No, sir. I can't do that. I could put my fist into his face. I could put him into a hospital. But I can't sneak around on him like that. Well, your friend didn't mind doing that to you, now did he? If you don't do it, Tucker, the alternative could be pretty ugly. And what is the alternative, sir? Put a team on him. Follow him, wait for him to make his move. We have a sharpshooter. So if I don't help you bring him in then I help you execute him? Is that it? Is that it? Now listen to me, son. Son. Listen to me. Stephen Smith has put himself beyond the pale. You didn't put him there. No one else did. And a moment ago, you were pretty angry. Yeah, I'm angry, but not just with Stephen. You know, in the academy, you told us what made us special was our humanity. And from day one, our humanity has been stripped away. I'll do it-- but not to finish him off, to save him. [phone ringing] Hello. Hey, cowboy. What's on that tiny little mind of yours? She did? What'd she have to talk about? Yeah. Sure I would. I'd like to hear all about it. OK. Uh, 7 o'clock. You pick me up. [suspenseful music] Honey. Might have to eat a little later. What is it? Is someone wrong? No, something just come up and I'm going to have to deal with it. You promised you'd help me with history. I'll be back before bedtime. Hey. Aren't you staying for dinner? Nope. But you go ahead, all right? OK. You mind yourself while I'm gone. OK? - OK. OK. [suspenseful music] You know, I was thinking that Jimmy Dean's got a birthday coming up, doesn't he? How old's that boy gonna be? 10? FARRELL: That's right. You want to drive? No, I drove over here. You can go ahead and drive. Well, I got them working on the carburetor, so we'll see how bad I screwed it up. I'm glad you came by. I wasn't sure where things stood with us anymore. What's that supposed to mean? The things you said to me in jail. Made me feel like you didn't believe in me anymore. Should I believe in you, Stephen? Yeah, you should. Otherwise, what's the point? So what did old Lea have to say? [laughing] Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Farrell. You're the one who knew what I wanted to do. You're the only one who really knew what I wanted to do. But it cost me. What do you mean? I mean that if you lost faith in me-- you know, don't you? Lea. She told you. And who have you talked to? What have you got, a .45? Give it to me. Stephen. Shh, quiet. Don't talk. [gun cocking] [gunshots] [tires screeching] Stephen. Stephen. [soft music]
