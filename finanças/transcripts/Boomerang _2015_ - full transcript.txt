Subs by CORR What do you mean? Yes, I say it. Why? - How about? - What do I think? I do not see the relationship with Astrid. I speak to you? - Do not! - Did he say anything to you? What a mistake to allow my wife to work with my sister! That's the problem. You call her your wife when she left you six months ago. You are the last one who can tell me that I do not see things in front of me. - Is it clear to you? - Very clear. Forgives... but I do not give more. A month ago we only talked about Noirmoutier. Excuse me, okay? Can you go more slowly? Cool. One month ago How can you make this mess in such a short time? I'm sorry, Dad, I did not do it on purpose. I hope not. Go help your sister. Margaux, you can not unpack without sending 25 SMS at the same time. Do you have a lover? - That's it, there's a lover. - What a stupid thing! How nice this is! What is it? He says it on the cover. You can not read? "The extraordinary history of the Paso del Gois." "To my Antoine, so that the Paso del Gois does not have secrets for you". Your Mom who loves you. " Was it my grandmother who wrote this? The one that drowned? - Let me see. - Wait, I'm watching. Give it to me. - I'm not going to break it. - Margaux, give me that book. - One second. - I ask you to give me that book! Give it to me! Incredible! I thought my grandmother died of an illness. Was he drowned then? Rose, I'm tired! Your sister says stupid things. Go to your room a few minutes. "To my Antoine, so that the Paso del Gois does not have secrets for you". - Do you remember his face? - Do not. It's weird, we do not have a picture of her. I think we should ask Papa. - Mom! - My love! - Look what's in the garden. - Thank you! Say goodbye to your father. Hello Beautiful. Margaux, say goodbye to your father. I'm coming back soon, my love. Poupé! My puppy! Do you come to look for it on Friday, within 15 days, at 6:00 p.m.? Yes Astrid, I got it. Does the boiler work? No problem? - I can see, if you want. - Not well. But... Can you come for your boxes? I'm telling you because I know you, and it can happen... Yes, I'm going to order. Well, I'm leaving. Sometimes, it's good to be alone. I'm sure it will help you. I'm calling you for the boxes. Well, I'm listening. I have... There is something that anguishes me a little, is that... normally my heart beats at 59 beats per minute and for 10 days I am in 80. 21 beats of difference. Do you think it's normal? It seems a lot to me. Does it happen to other patients? Do not? He cares little. He could make a cardiac arrest in his office and it would give him notoriety. On the contrary, I would give my office a bad name. And besides this? Did you have time to ask your father? It would allow me to overtake a lot. Yes, but I know it was so painful for him that... And for you too, it was very painful. Was not it this weekend that you were going with Shakespeare? - It's like that. - It's okay. - Bad luck. - Yes Do you drive? The brothers could spend the weekend together. Very good idea. So I do not think about my daughters. Where are you taking me, miss? To Noirmoutier, sir. You have talked to me so much. We will celebrate the date of his death with a good bottle. And you can remember her without putting Dad in all this. I'm going to look for my things. Do you feel the smell of pine? Inside, it mixed with the water from Colonia de la Abuela. We are going to see the beach. Is there someone. Let's go. Bernadette? - Yes? - Does not recognize me? - Antoine? - Yes Antoine Rey? Are you Agathe? We called and as they did not answer we thought that there was nobody. It's for the music... I was dancing... - Did you stay working here? - Yes When your grandmother sold the owners took me. and the following ones too. I stayed all my life here, like an old piece of furniture. Here it is. We often think of you. We worry a lot after the... How long ago? 20 years? No, it's going to be 30 years tomorrow. People disappear but the places remain. Yes. Was he here when they found his body on the beach? It is not here that you found your Mom. It was by Fromentine. On the other side of the bay. I apologize but Mrs. will not delay to arrive... But come see me tomorrow... Thank you. - By Mom. - By Clarisse. - You never managed to call her Mom. - Do not. For me, Mom is Anne-Sophie. You never thought they did not tell us everything? What do you mean? About Mama's death Maybe Papa did not... that maybe he hid us some things. You, if you do not worry every minute, you get bored. I think that Fromentine's business seems strange to me. If you drowned on the beach, why did you find it 10 km away? They can be the winds, the currents... You were 10 years old and I was 5... Maybe Dad, he just saved us the sordid details. You did the same with your daughters. You should change psychologist. Let's see! Well no, fuck. This stupid guy did not send me an SMS yet. Is the. I will answer him. I reach you. Antoine, where's Mom? Where is Mom? Antoine, where's Mom? Dad, where's Mom? Bernadette? - Can you take care of Agathe? - Bernadette, where's Mom? Dad, what happened? Can you leave us, please? Do you know what I remembered last night? You were little, Mom had just died... Antoine, do not follow. I'm sorry but I spent a terrible night. I did not close an eye. A moron in the office He lost his notebook and passed his guard. I have to correct all the manuscripts until Tuesday. Nobody answers me, so I'm going to have to go back to Paris. - Very well. - Sorry. I asked that fisherman about Fromentine. He does not seem logical either. I'm not the only one who seems strange. Lately, everything seems strange to you. Why are you tired you should be unpleasant? I do not feel like listening to your delusions! Sorry, I did not think it affected you that much. It does not affect me! Can you hear me when I talk to you? You are the last one who can tell me that I do not see things in front of me. - Is it clear to you? - Very clear. Forgives... but I do not give more. A month ago we only talked about Noirmoutier. Excuse me, okay? Can you go more slowly? Antoine! Can you go more slowly? They have not called the priest yet. How long will the rehabilitation last? Two and a half months to three. Three months? I do not know how I'm going to do the work. I did not talk to Astrid but she's going to fix it. Also with a computer you can start earlier. Do not tell him that For now I want you to think about just recovering. Do not worry, with Sophie let's go with you. And if your father is retained in Paris I will be here. There you go. - Can you come by the forms? - I got this. I'm the father. - Do you want me to bring something? - Some literary magazine. Well, I'll find it for you. Congratulations for the discretion. - You're good? - Yes Are you sure that Agathe does not have anything serious? Not well. The surgeon said he should have a nurse. Do you realize that we almost died the same day as Mom? I had forgotten your sense of humor. He refuses to think that Dad could have hidden something from us. It is the opportunity for them to talk a little in this family. It is exactly what my psychologist says. I have seen a psychologist for 6 months. I think he's going to help me fix some things. - Can you give me another chance? - Do not follow. You must think of yourself, now. You must progress. I know you're going to get over it. You do not love me anymore? Not like before. VELATORY ROOM Did not you see that it is forbidden to enter the room? Sorry, sorry. Did not read the posters? There are everywhere. - It is forbidden to enter. - How do you say? There are posters everywhere. "Prohibited to the public". - Did not you see them? - It's just that I got lost, excuse me. Are you looking for the Urgency? No. I had an accident with someone and I look for your room. There are no rooms here, there are refrigerators, go out. Excuse me. Sorry. Do you feel bad? Do you feel bad? - I feel dizzy. - Breathe slowly. - It never happened to me. - I cause that effect. Did not you do a tomography? - No. - I can not believe it. Why does it say that? In a violent crash there may be a skull trauma. - Do you have dizziness? - Oh yeah? Hi, with Radiology, to do a tomography. No, it's for a living. Everything is alright. Your brain is perfect. Cool! - Is that machine reliable? - 100% Go easy - Everything is alright. - Goodbye. Thank you. - Thank you, you were very kind. - It was a pleasure. If one day passes by here, come see me. I will show you my work, since I saw that you are interested. Not at all. Sorry, I do not want to say that your work is not interesting, It is that I really had lost. I will call her. - He will call me? - Yes, I'll call her. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I did not ask for your phone number. Where is Antoine Rey? What the fuck is this? Can not be! Bravo! Now you come? Two weeks of delay in the work. Two weeks and you arrive just now, hurt. What happened? I had an accident with the car. I have a question for you: It's not up to me, Friday night, to give me a ride. - Yes? - Do not. All right. There is a hole like that in the fence. It was open all weekend. There are those who took this for a hotel. Was not me! - Take your things and get out! - Come on, move. Take your things and get out of here. Get out! - Fred! - What? Speak well. Have him sign and bring me the work plan. Listen to me. If you have problems solve them in another site. Everything is alright. Did not you see the hole in the fence? It's okay. Nth issue on real estate issues. I suppose it must be sold. Y? You are already a grandmother. I adjusted the hinge. Oh yeah... Margot goes by asking for pictures of me when I was little. I do not know why he insists on that. It must be adolescence. I was wondering if you could not lend me an album. Albums? You know well that everything was lost when we sold Noirmoutier. But if when I took the toolbox I saw one up there. Well you have a very good view! - Yes, take what you want. - Cool. It is done! I adjusted that too. Do you see this dress? Your grandfather loved it. When they put me in the hole, as Brel said, is the one I want to take before being incinerated. What do you say, grandma? If you are in shape. Well... look, your grandfather was in top form, we were in the restaurant, I cut my escalope, I hear a tremendous "splach", looked up, I had my head in the puree. We are here and "clac", we are not anymore. I want to be buried with that one. I count on you. Promise it Promised, grandma. I promise you, too, that there's a long way to go before you wear it. You never know. Grandma, I know you do not like it very much but... I would like you to tell me one day about Noirmoutier. Yes, I know you're worried, but... what do you want to know? I do not know, things about Mom. I do not know much about her. I'll try to write it to you, but... I'm afraid I'll disappoint you because my head is not the same. Although it is not much. It is always something. You could hit. Sorry but it goes three times that I call them. - Are you coming to eat? - Yes Do you want me to win? No way! - Look, we have the same score. - But I have the crown. His Mom was not someone you forget. When he entered a place, he attracted attention. Was very beautiful. He often spoke to me about his Menton family. Simple people, I think. The gossips said that he had married for interest. Has no sense. With us, the domestic staff, she never made a difference. I can tell you that it is not ordinary. Your Mom, was someone of good. Being from here, it did not seem strange to them that the body appeared on the other side of the bay? You know, with the currents... It is sad to say, but we have drowned every year. Before I forget, this is what I pushed back then. His grandmother should come looking for him but I did not know more about her. Thank you. The rabbit hutches - Do you still have rabbits? - Do not. - Can I go see? - Of course. - Was there a huge one? - Yes, We called it The Sphinx. One afternoon his sister thought of taking him out for a walk. For that he released all the rabbits and I ran until the night. Why did we come to sleep here? It must have happened once or twice. With all the animals it was a paradise for children. Do not we sleep with you the day before the accident? The day before? No I dont think so. In short, it was so long ago. Complications may appear late. You leave me more calm. - But then, is it okay? - We'll have to wait. It evolves well. - Do you have for the bus and train? - Yes Dad. - Call me when you arrive. - Yes Do not drive too fast. TIDES, WINDS AND CURRENTS - Hello. - Hello! - It's better? - Yes - Luckily he was going to call me. - I'm sorry but... It was a round trip that I decided at the last moment. Do not worry. I take the bus at 16:37. There is time to take something. What do you think? - With much pleasure. - Yes? There is a bar next to it, on the right. I'm going to say goodbye to a friend and we'll see you there. Are you okay with vertigos? Yes? - Good trip. - Thank you. Who is this crazy woman who goes on a motorcycle and walks around with corpses all day? I was wondering how he decided to practice this trade. I imagine he did not wake up one morning saying... "Well, I'm going to work in the morgue." Is he very indiscreet? No way. When I was 12 years old, I found my father bathed in blood in the garage. When I say my father... what was left of him. He had the excellent idea of ​​shooting himself in the mouth when I came back from school. A few days later when I saw Dad in the wake room, I almost fainted. He had recovered his face. His face from before. Even pretty was. Yes, it was beautiful. I asked the undertakers who had done that. This is how I heard the word "tanatopraxia" for the first time. It's okay. Good... I got my answer. Is it always so direct? I became like that. But for years... I did not dare tell this to anyone. I was so afraid that the kids would be horrified I asked my friends to let them know before so they would not run afterwards. And you? Are you interested? - Not at all. - Nothing? So he usually gets lost in the morgues? Why does it bother you so much to talk about your mother's death? I do not know. Its the tradition. I do not speak, well yes, I speak to Agathe, but to no one else. To Astrid, three times in 15 years. Mr. King, I think we're not going to continue with these interviews. He will come to see me when he has spoken with his father. Until they do not, we can not move forward. Yes, that... I understood that. I think that since he's with my sister in the hospital, it's not the time. It's everything and in any case... we do not speak it in the family. With more reason. Do not try to make a mountain. To open a door it is not necessary to throw it down. Finished? We begin It is a very fashionable Swiss watch in the 80s. I am afraid that with the water the mechanism oxidized. It's a bad idea to bathe with a watch like this. Because it says? If his wife bathes with a clock of 3000 euros, not submersible, What does he say? Well, do I examine it and call it by the budget? Very well thanks. All right, I'll check with Antoine... yes. Good... We have a small problem. How would...? The plaquistas finished with the dining rooms, but... the electrician just told me it did not end. - That's it. - As you say? What good are the work plans if they do not look at them? Precisely, I verified your plan and there is an error. Besides, you did not give them... the appropriate version of the plan. The correct indications. Good job. Shit! It warms me up! Motherfucker! Why do not they call when they have a problem? How are you, Agathe? Look how well you walk. Silence, girls! Quiet! Agathe needs tranquility. Take it up, I'll help Antoine with the bags. Care on the stairs. I had forgotten that travel stressed you out. When we were children it was forbidden to touch the trunk. Finish philosophizing! We already heard you. You are welcome. - Agathe is better. - Yes We'll see what Dr. Borst says. I, the provincial doctors... Father? I... Why did you make your grandmother nervous? I ask you to give him a hand and you tell him about Noirmoutier. You know that that topic moves her. - I just talked to her for a few seconds. - Did not you ask for pictures, too? Yes, Margaux wanted to see pictures of me as a boy. Borst is categorical. With your arrhythmia, no emotions. Do not worry, I'll be careful. But she told me that she did not mind talking about that. Of course, he will not say otherwise. Try not to make her nervous about anything. Thank you. What are you looking for? The screw-driver for glasses. You have not seen him? - Is not it on your desk? - Margaux? - You took the screwdriver? - Do not. They do not know how it irritates me! If I left it here they should leave it there. You already know him You are not going to change it. Do you remember Bernadette's farm? The rabbits and all that? Do not. Do not you remember if we slept the night Mother died? Why do you ask me that? We never slept there. It is a strange coincidence. You have me tired with your delirium. Did not you see the screwdriver for the glasses? That's how you're going to cut yourself. - Well, I'll cut myself, Dad. - Do not be ridiculous, - Leave me, you're going to cut. - Wait, enough! You ask me to open the oysters and I'm doing it. Talk to me in another tone, please. You too, with another tone. I am not 5 years old, I can open the oysters, I can put a glass on the table without leaving marks... Enough! Finish! Do not start arguing. We celebrate the return of Agathe. Calm. Is incredible. I can not laugh in my own house. You say that? I do not believe you. Since this morning you are snorting and in a bad mood. The car, the suitcases.. Antoine, go calm down outside. Thank you. How are you going to talk to me like that? "Go calm down outside"... I can talk about what I want... I speak as I want, I express myself as I want. I can talk about the things I want to talk about. I can talk about my mother if I feel like talking about her. " In agreement. Charles! What does? Charles! Charles! Motherfucker! Sorry. To be honest... I've never seen you like that. Stop thinking that something is hidden from you. Finish with that. Why did they scream like that? I'll explain it to you later. I promise you. I'm not a girl anymore. Was it because of your mother? Well, it got too complicated, I'm leaving. - No no! - It's better that way. You stay with Rose. You'll ask Anne-Shophie to call a taxi to go with your mother. A kiss. Excuse. Antoine - Antoine... - I love you. See you. Why did you argue? Why? I told him on the phone. I need an identity document. I have my attendance card. There is my picture and my last name. No, I need an identity document. It's the same name as in the file, it's my mother. I came on purpose from Paris to take it to me. See well that it is the same surname. It's my photo and the same name as in the file, please. - Angèle. - Yes? A man asks for you. Thank you. - Hello. - Good day. - Stop by here and I came to see you. - Oh yeah? I realized that I did not answer your SMS. I'm sorry, but I was somewhat upset lately. I thought I had gotten too much into your life. It happens to me sometimes... often... forever. Effectively... I did not get lost, the first time I came here. No way. Sorry, but I'm not at all, Not at all used to talking about this. Actually I came here 30 years ago... My mother died, she drowned in Noirmoutier... and they did the autopsy here. There. How old were you? Was 10. It comes well, I'll be able to stop talking about my father. - Sorry. - But no. Welcome to the club. Yes... Do you have a paper? - Do you need this? - Yes thanks. I'm sorry to insist. I just want to know when I saw my mother alive for the last time. I think I slept here the night Mama died. Call me Yes, accidental. In any case, There is nothing suspicious about the report. In the end I do not know if my memories are real or I invented them. My sister says I'm paranoid. They saw the same, right? That Bernadette hides something. Why is it taboo in the family? There must be a reason. Excuse. Yes Dad? No, you are not interrupting. Yes, if you want. Tomorrow I am in the work. So I do not know. In your house, in the morning? Alright see you tomorrow. Kisses. You will be fine. First that the one who called you. And your father is going to do well to talk to his son. It moves me that you care about me. It moves me to be the first one you trusted. Goodbye. Good trip. When Anne-Sophie came into my life, it's true that... We never talk about all this again. I did not want to impose that... tragic past Even for me it was essential to move on to something else. It was another era, children were not told everything. In any case, I wanted it that way to protect you and your sister. Maybe it was a mistake. You will see, you will also do it with your daughters. I never realized that you suffered so much. I should have. So, if the night before they slept in Bernadette's, there... 30 years later... I think you ask too much. How is your heart? I did not ask you. - Impeccable. - Yours is always impeccable. If we will be anxious in this family. Take, in case it happens to you. It is very good for anguish. You will see that with age they do not improve. Well, I'm more relaxed. But no, Dad, it's all good. - See you soon. - Yes Forever Jean Wizman - Good day sir. - Good day. Identity document, please. - Do you work on Saturdays, sir? - How? - Do you work on Saturdays? - No no, I'm a construction manager, it's a bit of paperwork. What happens in his work? There are people. Do you have illegal workers? Close the vehicle and show us the work. Who gave him the keys? The one behind me? Nobody gave me the keys. Blame your work plan this will reach the Directorate. Do you realize what it will cost us? What the fuck is happening to you, Antoine? Goodnight Mr. Excuse me for bothering you so late. I explain. My mother... had an... friend called Jean Wizman, in the 80s... Very well. No, if he was born in 1975... excuse me. It does not match. I'm sorry I bothered. Thank God. Are not you sleeping, my love? It's late. - No, you talk too loud. - Excuse. Who is Jean Wizman? A family affair, honey. I'm tired. I had one day... ... horrible, I'll tell you later and I'll explain it to you. They already go 10 times that you tell me the same thing. You reproach your father for being like that and you do exactly the same. It is painful. Margaux... Dear grandmother, I hope you do not take wrong... They were forbidden to talk about the subject. As long as you do not talk, you end up closing your own family. I think I discovered that my mother had a relationship with a certain Jean Wizman. I would like to know if you were aware. What are you doing here? I went through the work and it seems that you do not work anymore. Yes. I sent you messages. You did not answer them. You're good? Only a family overdose. Dad wants to talk to you. It's about Jean Wizman. - I did not send that letter to you. - Your grandmother gave it to me. She is worried about you And us too. That you wonder about that death 30 years ago is normal but this is already a delirium, Antoine. I'm sorry to cause you so much worry, excuse me. Who is Jean Wizman? Was he his lover? Did not accidentally drown? Was it suicide? Because of him? Why do they look at me like that? Do you want to make me believe that I am unbalanced? Nobody looks at you strangely. Good. I bought that watch on one of my trips to Montreal. It's a weird model that she wanted and could not find. By chance I found this one. It's second-hand, Antoine. The engraving was already! There is no mystery other than that. When I came to live here it was very difficult to talk to you. I tried but you did not want me for having replaced your Mom. I know the change was hard for the child you were. But I thought that lately you had achieved a balance with all that. I'm wrong? - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry for calling you so late last night. Thank you for coming to see me well equipped. It's that they fired me. Shit! So sorry. What happened? It happens that I knew easier periods in my life. He told me if I could not spend two or three days in your house. I know we do not know each other very well. Well, I agree. - I carry you? - Yes - Do you know what Margaux told me? - Do not. That I reproach my father for hiding things from me and I do the same with her. At least you already know what you have to do. Would you like to come to Paris a few days with me? But... You have your daughters the weekend. Yes. So you ask me to spend a weekend with some girls. Is what you want? If you are, I will be forced to tell you everything. What is the use of making up the dead if they are dead? East.. to make the family happy. It is for those who remain, so that when... When they see them dead, they look pretty. - Do you touch the dead? - So is. How did you meet? I met Angèle in the place where they took the body of the grandmother. When he drowned. So is. I've been talking about my mother for a long time. But every time I give excuses, which are very young, we have to wait. And in the end I do not tell them anything. What gives me more pain is... I do not remember the last time I saw my mother alive. I'm excited to tell you all this. Because keeping those things to himself, one day one pays them. At your age they do not realize it. But over time he isolates them from others. You're good? - Dad: Kisses and see you tomorrow. - I love Pauline. We brush our teeth. The bears await us in bed and we go to sleep. Very well. - Are you going to show me a dead person? - Show you a dead man? I promise I'll ask Dad. - With fingers crossed? - Yes Come on, we'll see. Go to bed. - And you fall asleep right away. - Yes Yes. How you feel? They are not so unbearable. They are not unbearable. Everything is alright. Father! Father! Help yourself. I'm coming. Can not find your teddy bears? They're here. If you do not leave them in their place... I love Pauline Delete message - How are you? - Good and you? All right. We had a nice time, right? Yes, it was nice. - You go to sleep? - Yes - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Yes. Oh yeah? Wait, already low. I'm tired! What is Mama doing? He is with a lady. He told us to wait. - I am tired of waiting! - It's coming. Agathe! Agathe! Mom! Are you sure? Yes. How did you remember it? Your daughter is going to explain it to you. Wait, Jean Wizman... Jean in English is a woman's name. Jean. Do what you want with that but do not tell me anything else. I'm sick of your stories. Goodbye. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Is it her? I dont know... It is very good, very fluid. Yes, technically it is almost perfect. Now, I would like to see more of you, inside. - Understands? - Yes I think so. Yes Yes. Very well. I was thinking. Do you know the work of Gustave Doré? Very little I have a weird book of him at home. If you're interested, you could come and see it. He is very friendly... but with my husband and my children it's a bit complicated... After this he did not return to any of my courses. Although he knew that his mother was married... I wanted to see her again. I was obsessed. I waited six months... until the beginning of summer. He had told me about Noirmoutier. I tried my luck. Touch! We are going to buy an ice cream. - What taste will you choose? - I do not know, maybe chocolate. Wow! What is he doing here? A former student told me about the beauty of this place. I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Children, I present to you the lady who gives me drawing classes in Paris. How strange you talk. What is your name? Jean. My name is Jean. Hi. Coming Soon... We could not stand a day without seeing each other. Did my father know? I do not know. I was almost never there. He began his career, he worked without stopping. He complained about his absence but... especially to stay with his mother-in-law. They did not get along, I think. At the end of August She was convinced that her grandmother had discovered us. Well, there is no one. Look... No one. It was that day that he made the decision to go to London with me and take you with us. We are at the station for the train at 7pm. I'll go find the children at the dock and bring them. Antoine, take two minutes of your sister I'm already on. - Why are they in the car? - Where is your drawing? I'll show you It's a surprise. I'm going. My sister had an empty apartment in London. Tell me you will be. I called her to prepare it. Of course I will be. We meet at 7pm. at the station. I could not believe so much happiness. - Is the taxi? - Yes, Mrs. Wizman. I called your room because they left a letter for you. - Who? - A lady. Dear Jean: I know that you will hold a grudge infinitely but I will not take the train with you. I changed my mind. I can not do it. There are my husband and my children. Well, thank you, sir. I can not deprive you of your father. Our relationship was a tremendous mistake. Do not try to see me again, I beg you. I know you will understand my choice. Clarisse. Since 30 years ago, Every time a taxi stops in front of the gallery, I hope it's her who gets off. Hereinafter, I will stop waiting. Maybe he did not tolerate the idea of ​​not seeing her anymore. No. Clarisse loved them too much to end her life. - Does your grandmother still live? - Yes Blanche Thanks, Anne-Sophie. Angèle Wow, girls! How many gifts! Beautiful Christmas, is not it? Thank you. - A canapé? - I can not say no. Thank you. Do you want, Antoine? - It's family. - I saw it already, Goodnight. I congratulate you. - Do you want, Dad? - Thank you. I'm the only one left alone. I've heard that before. Everyone I know ends up being bored. All children of great families with those moccasins from before. They look like cures. - Maybe there are no surprises. - It's what I ordered. You feel the power of the FNAC like every Christmas. This is from my son... How do you like champagne? It's good! I found it in the winery below. Is very good. - The manager advised me. - Nice color, too. That's perfect for me. What are you doing? Remove those photos immediately! Motherfucker, it's Christmas! - And so? - Grandma is an old woman! Are not you interested in knowing what Jean Wizman told me? - I do not want to know tonight! - It was she who gave me the picture. What a good choice. Where did you find this? There were two interested but exceeded. The Devillemores also wanted it. - I love. - Kiss Me. - I complete my collection. - It will look good... Do not you comment on my gift? You do not like my photo? Do not like my picture? Do not you like the picture, grandma? Well then... It was Jean Wizman, Dad, Jean Wizman gave it to me. Do not pronounce Jean, you say "Jean", it's a woman. Antoine, you're bothering us. Go find more champagne instead of the interesting one. "Make yourself interesting"? I have not heard that for a long time. Did you know, Dad, that your mother hated mine? What is he saying? You are not the same, Antoine. The shortest jokes are the best. So finish with this! Could you answer me, grandma? What happened to my mother on August 29, 1984? Charles, we are at your house. Do something. You're overreaching, Antoine. Excuse yourself immediately! - I have to apologize? - Yes! Do you want to talk about the watch you bought in Montreal? Get out of here! Get out of this house! Go away! Go away! Shouts! Like when we were kids to shut up! Are not you ashamed to tell me I'm crazy? They've been lying to me for 30 years! This is what you achieve. That, grandmother, become the sick one! It's what you do when we talk about the past! Enough! Finish with this, Antoine! It was enough. Ends! - Come, let's go outside. - Get out of here! Get out of this house immediately! Go away! Outside! Are you feeling well, Blanche? - Did not it hurt you, Dad? - No, do not worry, honey. I'm fine. Do not worry. All right. What do we do? Well... I'm hungry. - Are we going to McDonalds? - McDonald's? - Okay let's go. - Are you serious? Christmas at McDonalds. Let's go. Cool. We leave the gifts. Forget them. We will not find balance without accepting vertigo. Hoping to return to our complicity of yesteryear. PS- And win the game of piglets! Watch this. Rose gave it to me. Do you know what he told me? I'll keep it all my life. That just before dying eat with their nuggets. She will bury me in the field and I will have a tree in my belly and she will eat my fruits. Its beautiful. Very beautiful! - Did you get excited? - Yes, it touched me. - Did you feel moved? - Let! And who gives me food? I do not, because you still have not gained anything. You never know. Let go! Bernadette? Good day. I did not know that he worked here too. Good day. Is that in winter there is less work. My condolences, for your grandmother. Are you buried on Tuesday? So sorry. I can not... no one told me. Neither did Agathe. I feel like I'm not more identified with the family. I can not not go to my grandmother's funeral. I'm so sorry. Father. Father. I wanted to see you but... but Dad is still irritated. I think that over time... You did well to come. The priest asked me to write something. Tell me how is it? Do I read it to you? My dear grandmother, I will never forget your inimitable monologues or your stuffed tomatoes that no chef will ever equal, Not the precious attention you gave me to Mama's death. "Precious attention" is not a little...? It is balanced with "stuffed tomatoes". How it happened? He went to bed like every night and morning... the woman of care found her. His heart failed him. Our condolences Thank you. My wife has something important to tell you. First, I apologize for not having attended to it when he came back home. It was your grandmother who who called us, this... to tell us not to attend to him. I must... finish something. For 30 years we suffer because of his family. So you could listen to us for a moment. It was very hard to bear the burden of the King family. The night before, they actually slept on the farm. It was your grandmother who asked me to have them. Your mother did not know they were with us. I went to look for them at the navigation school and took them home. - When will Mom come? - Tonight... or tomorrow if you are already asleep. Why did not he come looking for us at school? He went to do some shopping with your grandmother, do not worry. Come, let's see the animals. What are you doing Agathe? I already grabbed it. Open the cage to me, Agathe. Finish with this. Where are they? Are you the one here with that woman? What a shame! In my family! I assure you that no judge will hesitate to take away your parental rights. Look well. - Where are my children? - Sit down and write. Write what? Where are Antoine and Agathe? Shut up! Children are in safety, better than with you. I tell him he feels. Let no one know about this abject relationship. Scribe: Dear Jean: I know that you will hold a grudge infinitely but I will not take the train with you. Scribe! Bernadette. - Bernadette! - Yes ma'am? Can you take this to the Hotel de la playe? The hotel that is on the continent in front of the Paso del Gois. I checked the tides and have time to go and return. - Good day. - Good morning, ma'am. I have come to leave a letter for Mrs. Wizman. - Very good, I'll give it to you. - Thank you. Did Ms. Wizman leave the hotel? - Mrs. - Did you deliver the letter? Yes. Sorry. Mrs. You can not cross now! It's too late! You can not cross lady! Mrs! Mrs! Mrs! But what is he saying? It's not possible. Have I brought this for you to see. A car victim of the Paso del Gois. The driver drowned. Dear grandmother: I will remember your voice... your look, your humor... your charisma If sometimes it was difficult to talk to you, you knew how to pay attention in the crucial moments of life. I will never forget... your inimitable monologues... Not your stuffed tomatoes that no chef will ever match. Not the precious attention... Not the precious attention you gave me... You lent me to Mama's death. Through your emotion, Agathe... we all perceive the indelible mark that Blanche Rey will leave forever in our hearts. You have to be fair, we must act according to what the heart tells us, Do not do to the other what you do not want us to do. That was what you defended. I would like to express my affection for my brother who dared to... apply these values what you advocated and that maybe... and that maybe you did not apply with yourself. I'm sorry Dad but I can not continue. Before the farewell song I remind you that Blanche's family He invites us to join us in the cemetery of Clamart. Did you know? I agree to speak, but not now. Yes or no? Were you aware? How could you do that to us? How did you let us idolize her when was he responsible for the death of our mother? What are you saying? What are you talking about, Charles? How? You've been telling me lies for years. What happened? What happened? I hear you. One night, my mother called me to Paris... to tell me that your mother had left with the car. At first I thought it was... another fight more, Of the many they had, it was one... a latent war. Then I drove all night and when I got to Noirmoutier It was already day. I saw the car... in water. Clarisse! Clarisse! I questioned my mother all morning about what happened. He swore to me that he did not know anything. Then they called the Gendarmerie. Hello? Yes, it's me. During the interrogation he was in front of me. I did not say about the fights between them two. I said nothing. It was too late, I did not want to overwhelm them... and I did not say anything. It was your wife. It was our mother. I've had that here for 30 years. My little daughter, no... - I'm leaving, Dad. - Antoine. I'm proud of you. What are you doing here? I came to win with the piglets. - Are you serious? - Sure, it's good of her. I can not believe it! Hey, liar! It was you who invented the apple, Margaux told me! I swear I did not invent it, just... It's a story about her, really Rose I just asked him to recycle it for you. So you're a little liar. Yes, very small. But it worked, I did well. - Double snout! - You put them in your hand! Did you think I did not see you? You did not see me, you know I do. Antoine... There is a message from Jean Wizman. I... I keep ordering. Subs by CORR
