We got it. Let's get out of here. Yeah. So, how's business? Mister Vector! Please help me! You didn't have to kill him! Do things halfway, and you won't last very long, Yugo. Come, I want to have a talk with you. Yugo? Who knows where that young fool's gone off to. I know that's right. The way he babbles about going to Zalem and misers his credit chips... He's funny in the head, all right. He really thinks Zalem will let him in. Now, what was it I told you three years ago? "Give me 10 million chips, and I'll make sure you get to Zalem?" Yes, Sir. Normally, it would take a lifetime to acquire that kind of capital. But you, you want to do it in three years. I'm impressed. Oh, it's not that difficult. You know, I'm always looking for kids who're willing to take a chance, but I think you've got more potential than most. Ah, go on. Here, try this. It's the real thing, straight off the tube for Zalem, not that processed shit. I see... Smooth, isn't it? Can't you just taste that essence of Zalem? Yugo, I don't have to tell you this, but most of the goods collected, refined and packaged here in Scrap Iron City get exported to Zalem through the Factory tubes. The crap we get to keep for ourselves is just that. Now, seeing as I'm in a position to oversee those exports, why shouldn't I share in the benefits? Say, Yugo, why don't you join my operation? But Zalem is where I'd... Zalem! And once you got there, what then? Do you really want to be homeless and friendless in a place like Zalem? By delivering my shipments to Zalem you could achieve real wealth and power. You could live in the lap of luxury, just like the citizens of Zalem. Think it over, Yugo. Yugo? Yugo! Did they make you drink? You, in the car! Shut up! Don't be a fool! If you've hurt Yugo, you'll answer to me! I'll be seeing you. Yugo, you know the answer I want to hear. Please hang in there, Yugo! Oh, my head... Here's some water. Oh...? See what happens when you get drunk? I'm not a kid, and it was only one drink. You're not acting like yourself. What happened? Just what are you doing here, anyway? Oh, I guess I just wanted to see you, Yugo. Gally, do you have a secret dream? Zalem's not just a... a fantasy of wealth and power to me. I want to see what it's like up there, so high and far away. I understand. There'll be sights I've never seen. Wonders I can't even imagine. That's what really I want. Yugo, how much does it cost to go to Zalem? In credits? Hey, Sir, grease your gears with high grade oil and teflon? Best lube jobs in town! I'll take a squeeze of that, kid. Thank you, Sir! Hey, kid! So that's your game, is it? Caught with your hands on my spine, no less! Now, let's take a look at your face. Take the mask off. You asshole! Let Yugo go! Yugo? Run, you moron! NO! Quick thinking little bastard, but I'll bet there's already a price on your head, Yugo. Oh, Yugo, it's you. What? Trouble? A hunter warrior... disguised as a customer... He killed Tanji, and he knows my name. Calm down. It's over, and nothing you can do now will make any difference. I want you to bring all of the money you've saved to my office. You mean... you'll send me to Zalem? Zalem? We'll talk about that later. Just get your ass over here. Yes, Sir. What's happened to the once great Zahriki? What a losing streak! Tanji... Shit! It's all over folks! Zahriki's no match for ... Damn! I guess it's time to rebuild Zahriki again. Dr. Chiren, that's your department. Why should I even bother? I've used everything, all my tricks and techniques... And still, I can't win. What was that? So when am I going to Zalem? Hey, look at this! All these enormous bounties... Gally, huh? This could be a hot ticket! I can see it now: a young, female champion! Hey wait, this is the girl from Yugo's place! Gally? You mean you know her? Oh, I get it. You want Gally to fight in the coliseum? Absolutely! It'll be a smash! You don't really think Gally will fight for you? Of course she will. She'll do anything to protect a friend with a bounty on his head. Doctor, I want you to find Gally. Why should I? Do this for me, and I'll send you to Zalem. What's with the sudden mercenary zeal? Gally, when you became a hunter-warrior, you said it wasn't for the money. I'm saving, so I can go to Zalem with Yugo. Gally, who said that you could go to Zalem? Have you told him how you feel? No. And how does Yugo feel about you? Well... Amazing! Such depth of feeling... And now for the latest Bounty Bulletin. Number 7: Yugo, wanted for Spine Theft and Murder. Bounty: 80,000 chips. Yugo? He's wanted? Gally! Report him to the Factory as soon as he's sighted. Four... six... eight... that makes 9,500,000 chips. Just a few more... Yugo. Gally? You did this? Where will you go? I'm not going anywhere, except back to town, to Vector's place. I'm not going to give up on Zalem. That's crazy. The hunters are looking for you. Don't you understand? Going to Zalem is more than just an escape from this scrap metal prison. It's a war! A war between me and this garbage heap! No matter how insignificant I may be, I still have my dreams, my pride. I won't let this corroded metal monster grind me into the dirt! I'll be leaving as soon as it gets dark. Go home, before you get involved any further. Bye. Yugo, listen... I love you, Yugo. I have to know how you feel about me, Yugo. Why are you bringing up something stupid like this now? Go home! Answer me! So now we're partners in crime, are we? My mouth is tingling like I kissed a battery. It's the lightening. On days like this, my body takes on a charge. I've wondered... about the scar on you wrist. This scar? It's a keepsake of my brother. A keepsake? I used to have a brother, much older than myself. He had a wife, and they raised me together. They cared for me as if they were my own parents. He was an engineer for the Factory, and he enjoyed his work. And my sister-in-law was loving and generous. But it wasn't enough for my brother. He'd look up at Zalem, yearning. "I want to go to Zalem someday," he must have said that a million times. It was his dream. Finally, he acted. He could get to Zalem, he decided, by balloon. The Factory had prohibited the creation of any kind of flying machine and put a heavy bounty on the head of anyone who built one. My brother knew what the consequences could be, but he followed his heart. When I was ten years old, the airship was completed. But on that very night, the hunter-warrior came. My sister-in-law had betrayed my brother, reporting him to the Factory. And the hunter? What happened to your sister-in-law? I don't know. I suppose she must be living somewhere, with someone. I think I know how your sister-in-law must have felt. I'd be jealous too, if MY lover was obsessed with something I couldn't understand. You're scaring me. At first I think I'd go along with it. But after so long, I might come to believe that he'd leave even me. And if I couldn't have him myself, killing him might be easy. You'd have to kill me to keep me away from Zalem. That's true, isn't it? So what am I to do now? Should I kill you? How much more do you need to get to Zalem? About 500,000 chips. Okay, I'll take you to Vector's. What? I'm not taking my eyes off someone so important to me. I've hidden some chips myself. It should be about 600,000. Go to Zalem with it. Then, if everything goes right, I'll save up enough to follow you. But... Don't worry. Go. Gather your chips. Right. There you are! Damn you! Too little, too late, Gally. You've beaten me to every kill since Grewcica. But this time the head and the bounty belong to me! Just like his brother's! No! Yugo's mine! Oh, so that's the way it is? There's no room for things like love or mercy in the Hunter's Code. If you want him so badly, come and take him. I'd rather have your head, anyway. Prepare yourself! All right... This will stop your flitting about! Say your prayers! Do you really think this desperate effort can delay me forever? No, he's getting cold! colder... colder... So very cold... My Yugo is dying! If only I could give you my life... Huh? Gally?! Ido, save Yugo for me. How's Yugo? Don't worry, Gally. The operation was a success. Thank you! Well, the reason he lived was because of you. If you hadn't bypassed your own life support system, feeding your blood into his arteries, his brain would have died of oxygen starvation. But I wasn't the one who did the bypass. Chiren did it. Chiren? So she's the one. What? Yugo's dead? Yes. Killed by a hunter and then struck by lightening! Well, I guess you've lost your meal ticket! What happened to Gally? I have no clue as to her current whereabouts. This is a big city; it may take me quite a while to find her. Well, then... Hey, wait a minute? I think it's time to send you to Zalem. Yugo was tricked. The story about paying passage to Zalem is just a scam. It's not possible for someone from here to go to Zalem. I know. The brand on my forehead means that I was once a citizen of Zalem. It's not true! Gally! Get out there and find Yugo. What? Who the fuck are you? So you're the one who lied to Yugo. You mean that Zalem thing? Hey, it's not my fault if someone's an easy mark. And you need the money so badly? Well? Yugo destroyed his life because of you. Yugo ruined his life stealing money for a lie! What have you done with Chiren? Over there.... What the...? Organ replacements? This was Chiren?! The order comes down from Zalem every month. I don't know what they do with them. He couldn't have... Wait for me Zalem! I'll be with you soon! Hey! Have you seen a boy come through here? He just climbed out on the tube. This is a restricted area. Please keep out! What's that ring for. It's a defense ring against rodents and other vermin. Zalem drops them periodically, to keep rats from climbing the tubes. It's Zalem! At last, I'm almost there! Yugo! Gally? Yugo, let's go back home, please. No! Not a filthy stinking sewer! Zalem is my destiny! Until now my life was a cosmic joke, my entire existence, pointless and unnecessary. Coward! There's more to life than Scrap Iron City and Zalem. You were my secret dream, Yugo! Together we could find a way! A new life! We could. Look out, Yugo! Yugo! Yugo! I'm glad to have known you. Goodbye. Yugo!
