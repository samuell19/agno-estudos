- This is the truth about Jonty Craig. - Share and comment below. - The infamous social media influencer. He was a fool, a liar, a cheat, but most of all, he was my friend. He changed the way we see the world. - You fucking idiot. - This has to be one of the most devastating events to hit this area. - All footage from the night of the murders has been mysteriously erased. - No comment! - They're burning! I can hear them screaming. - Is Jonty a murderer? - This is the truth. Share it. - We did it, guys! College. This is sick. This is one of the best colleges in the country. The academic standards are really high, but I managed to get in on my interview. Yes, I've made some mistakes, but this is my second chance. - Are you off that "Brats in Belgravia" show? - Uh, yeah, you got me, bro. Guilty as charged. - You're a dick, mate. - It's a great place to start my journey. I can't wait for you to meet my three housemates. Yo, what's up? Alpha male in the house. Hi, I'm Jonty. We're roommates. - Yeah, Zauna. Nice camera. - This is Zauna. She's into making documentaries. - There are many young men like him in my community. Please don't judge him. - And like me, she's working through the deep shit. Hey, Zauna, we're just gonna grab a couple of drinks. - Who are you? I don't like this place. - I'm sorry, Grandma. - Hey, are you okay? Sorry. - Hey, bro. - Do I know you? Oh, wait, how old are you? - Uh, 19. - Fuck! - Pete is typically Scottish. I know we're going to have great banter. I spent a day observing him, and he's a lone wolf, which I totally respect. - Can you get that camera off me, please? - Oh, no, she can't. I'm an influencer. That keeps happening. - You just didn't set the runners. See? - This is yours? - Oh, yeah, but I don't like that one. It's a bit big. - How much did that cost? - Uh, Dunno. It's Christmas present. - Who's this. Fire. - Hi. - Amber is the most like me in the house. She's fascinating. She's got issues that she's working through, but she also has great banter. Boo. And you know what they say about the crazy ones. She's got the mental health worker round already. - Oh, Pete babes. Hey. - Becky. - I thought you'd be in the mature students' quarters. - Have you seen their rates? - Okay, Amber, like I said, yeah, Tuesdays, hmm? You call anytime that you like. - Thank you. - Who is this little legend right here? I am loving your hair. - Zauna. - Ah, loving that name. So come on. Why don't you share yourself? - Sorry? - Share yourself. You know, like, what's your degree, or what's your heritage? Why don't you share yourself with everyone here? - Share yourself. - Leave her alone! - Okay, no sharing. Fair enough. I'll leave you lot to, you know, get on with it. Peace out. It's for young people all of the world to help heal their world and themselves. So it is vital that we share this with as many friends as we can so that we can start- - You've gotta be better than her. - Later that night, my past came back to haunt me, but all I could be to keep the haters at bay was real. Unfortunately, the dadbomb insisted on history and politics. - Is that because you got kicked off that shite reality TV show? - Oh my God. That is where I recognise you from. - What now? - It's not a thing, really. - Oh, it's thing, really. Look, let me find it. - Oh, Pete, no. - No, no, no, no, no. Honestly, no, no, I know what it is. - Yo, we need a war that'll kill all you scum. We'll find the cheaple! We'll find the cheaple! - Fuck off! - I'm fucking Jonty Craig, mate! We'll find the cheaple! Look, I'm not that guy now. I'm on a journey. - It's all right. Everyone's a fuckup. - But later that night, it was more than my past that was haunting me. Just some facts and stats. - I can't think of anything to say. - Facts and stats. I'm Pete, and I'm cleverer than all of you, and more skint, so I am taking this. What are you gonna do about it? - What's that? - Sounds like we're haunted. - That would be good to vlog about. - Do you think? - No. It's just the stoner neighbours trying to mess with us. Get tae fuck, ya pricks! - Okay, we've been enjoying Pete when he is back from the "library." - Fucking shut the fuck up! - He's very easily led. Observe. - Well, we are gonnae slam these noisy bastards down. Come on, let's go. Look, mate, I know it's you. It can't be anybody else. You're playing rave music from the '90s. You look like you're from the '90s, so just stop it. - I can only enjoy music with integrity. - Och, you look like a tired eagle, man. Jesus Christ. - So where is the music coming from? - Are you hiding speakers in the walls, Jonty? You trying to fuck with our heads? - Pete, sober up. You're acting like an idiot. - Ooh, maybe it's your ghost, Amber. - What is that? - Where did it go? - The back door. - He's in the basement. - We need to go down there. - Fucking hell. - Hello? Is there someone down here? Are you okay? - Jonty. Well, I am not going down there. - Eh, you can stay up there on your own. - Shit. Ah, for God's sake! Wait there. What the fuck? Ah, it stinks in here. - Yo, man's got a habit. - Look at the flyers. See, this explains the shite music. - Yeah, but what does he play on, Pete? Oh, my music? Of course. - Jonty. - Ah, shit! - Careful, Jonty! - Get back here! - Pete, leave him! He's running. Just leave him. - What, so is that like a drug thing? - Withdrawals. He ain't gonna hurt no one but himself. - And who is a nice girl that you know what a rat lair is? - Can we just call Campus Security and get him out of here, please? - Please let me stay! Please let me stay! Please let I'm stay. Let me stay. You don't understand. Let me stay, please. - Only a right arsehole would post this. - Please let me stay! - Be better than that, Jonty. - I would never do that. - Let me stay. You don't understand. Let me stay, please. Please let me stay! Please let me stay, let me stay, let me stay. Please. Please let me stay. Please let me stay Let me stay, please. - Since Pete versus Rattling Man, my followers have gone up by thousands. Cheers, guys. Please spread the word, and please, please, please share and comment below. Now, I've been getting to know all of you, and it's obvious you maniacs love the scary stuff almost as much as you love Amber. - I'm Amber. I have to see Becky every Tuesday, or they up my meds. I've got low self-esteem, daddy issues, and I'm always falling for toxic males. But I got fit hair. - Amber seems really sweet. - Is she really you? - I just really love Amber's fashion. She's just so horny. - Hot. - So fine. - Like, mm. Let's see some titties. Give the people what they want, bro. - All right, let's get a selfie. Ready? - Oh. Oh my gosh, it's in video mode. - Now, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't melting for Amber, but how can the Jonts compete with a ghost? Yeah, actually a ghost. Get on this. - Cults such as Headhunters believe that owning a spirit- - Pete left his laptop open, and it started showing some creepy shit. So random. - That's our uni. - But this college's success rates are almost matched by the amount of suicides. - Yes, spirits are engaging with computers. - Ilana Clark! Love her. - Stick with an old-fashioned cassette. Spirits are so drawn to that. - Jonty. - Some believe they can even- - Get a shot of the laptop. - Okay. - Cults such as Headhunters believe that owning a spirit- - Zauna. - Gave them- - What are you doing? - Mystical powers. - Are you getting it? - Mm-hmm. - But this college's success rates are almost matched by the amount of suicides. - The museum. - Spirits are engaging with computers, but for me, stick with an old-fashioned- Oh! Shit, mate! - Is there someone here? Don't touch my stuff! - Pete, let us explain. - There's a ghost on your laptop. - My PhD is on this laptop. You want to scare people, Jonty? - Pete and I just share such great energy. You know, we ended, we ended the night laughing, okay? The haunted laptop has brought us even closer. - I knew I couldn't trust Jonty to tell the whole story. I had to find a way to tell mine, because this is what really happened. - See, if I'd have come from a family like yours, I'd be a millionaire. - Pete, leave him alone. - What the fuck are you about? I know what you are. - Pete! - If it wasn't for Amber, Jonty could've ended up in hospital, and Pete in a cell. I needed to get my story. - Jonty. Huh! I must say, I am loving your work, babes. Your vlogs are just, I mean, you are just smashing it, are you? Oh, how many followers do you have now? Is it 70,000? - Uh, 80. - What? Damn. Ah, that's crazy. Now, you're gonna think I'm a little bit loco, lol, but I put a wish into the universe that maybe you and I could do a cheeky little video together. - Sounds like filth. - Just imagine the cross-gen appeal. - Hold on. You've got 600-odd subscribers, and that fanny has 80,000. So Becky, who stands to benefit from this cross-gen appeal? - Pete, Becky's vlogs are actually amazing. You just need to break through. - Uh, you know what, thanks, Becky, but I'm still finding my own voice at the moment. - Oh. Oh, little legend. Just in time. We're just discussing Jonty's vlog ambitions. I mean, he could be the voice of a generation. - Or better yet, a social media influencer. - Jonty, make sure you're getting this. - Are you seriously going for a selfie right now? Come on, you! Stop it, Jonty! - So we have seen spooky laptops. Oh! Shit, mate! And angry furniture. What's up next gave me total fear. Turns out ghosts are just like us, strapped to the celly. Share this one. Comment below. - Maybe some wee bleached arsehole is pranking us to boost his followers. - You ready? Okay, so for the last hour, we've been getting called in strange bursts. First two at a time, and then three at a time, like someone is trying to call us who, but who? - This is why we need more cameras in this place. We need to see it as it's happening, not just Jonty telling everyone what they've missed. - D'you know what, this is- Jesus Christ! - Oh my God, there it is. This is it. - And this means? - Well. Let's all hear this, shall we? - Amber. Jonty. - Zauna. Gimme the camera. - Put it on speaker. Put it on speaker. So. Like, Zauna, it's like she can't speak. - Zauna! - Zauna, the walls. - You all right? - Thank you so much for the camera. Grandma, it's gonna be really useful. - I would like to go home. I don't like it here. - Okay. Let's not get too excited. You can talk to her tomorrow. - Oy! Where's your ghosts, you dick? - Ignore him. - But we need to get to two million followers. We need more ghosts. - Never gonna happen. - Well, why not? - Remember the cupboards? Your selfie? Everything you do is me, me, me. We can't rely on you, and we never know when the ghost's gonna show up. So we need as many cameras rolling as possible. - Okay. - And I want my own protected cloud. No one has access to it. Not even you. And I do all the editing. - A ghosty twat in a big twat hat. - But I'm good at editing. - Where is your ghost, you prick? That'll piss him off. - All right, the college life vlog. This is now a haunting vlog. Numbers and thumbs are way up. - My dream is to create affordable, renewable energy. But my dream seems so shallow compared to yours. - Pete, what if you were the science guy that made all other science guys see the ghost exists? I mean, Zauna, this guarantees that job in TV you want. And Amber, people love our whole will they, won't they vibe. - Mostly they just wanna see me send nudes. - Show me. - Ew! - D'you know, all I'm saying is, this haunted laptop shite is perfectly explainable, especially if you've got the money to afford it. - Ugh, Pete. - See, Amber plays along because she craves male attention, even if that male is Jonty. - Oh, fuck you, Pete. - And Zauna should know better, but she's conditioned to obey people like Jonty. She's colonised. - That's too far. I like Jonty's idea. I think it's fun. Everyone loves a ghost, right? - So there are fierce phantoms in this place, and we're gonna get them on camera. - What were you gonna say next? "We should split up and search for clues." - But it's traditional. - I hate you so much. Listen, I'm truly sorry for what I said. - With Pete and Zauna distracted, I could get Amber alone. But were we really alone? - It didn't need to be just us when weird shit was happening before, did it? - You know, I'm cold. Let's cuddle up. - Never gonna happen, vlog boy. D'you hear that? - Yeah. - It's coming from there. - What is it? - Turn around. Turn around! - Shh. Listen Let's go. Let's go! The safest place I could think of was my bedroom. - I will start believing you if you turn that thing off. - Yeah, of course. It's off. - I am a mess. - It's okay. Look, I've got you. I've got you. - That is it! I am moving out! - Hey, hey, hey. The vlogs I'm posting, people are way more into you than anyone else, okay? Look, look, you're strong and you're smart. You're amazing. Why do you think I'm falling? - I mean, Becky does say that you're good for me. - Well, thanks, Becky. - I already regret this. - What was that? It's coming from there. - Okay, get under the duvet. - Oh my soul! - Stay here! - No! Don't you dare leave me! - On the other side of the house, I had my own agenda. - How can someone as smart as you believe in all that crap? - Ghost stories sell. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me... Take the camera. Let me just tidy up a bit. So, uh, Jonty's behaviour could be a proper box-set documentary, right? You could sell that to Netflix. - You've got to have a hustle. - Yes. See? You're clever. I mean, you'll have a career before you've graduated. And I'm with you, if you'll have me. I could be your willing accomplice. You know, like a... - Yeah, okay. But Pete, calm down the drinking. - Yeah. Ever since my mum died, I've been looking for a reason to stop. And d'you know, busting Jonty seems like a good reason. - And what if it's a real ghost? - No! Don't you dare leave me! - Oh, he's lock the door. Jonty! Jonty, what's going on? Jesus Christ. Fucking door! - Jonty, What the hell was that? - Hey, you guys... Pete, Pete, I swear, the key was in the door. I swear. I swear the key was in the door. Pete! - Pete, there was no way that Jonty did that. There is something in the house. I'm calling Becky. - Hey, sleep in my room. I'll step all night protecting you. - I've never heard it called that before. - A sad attempt to get more followers led to a drop in numbers for Jonty, and Amber even more highly-strung than before. - What is going on? - Why are you doing this to Amber, Jonty? - That is it, okay? All the pranks, the music, everything, it stops now! - No, no, no, the other stuff, it wasn't me. I just did the prank with Ollie. - Huh! Okay, Annabelle. On you go. - So did Jonty learn his lesson? Did Jonty back down? - Wow. What do I say to you? - Really? - Really? - Yeah, the whole prank thing is a bit 10 years ago. See ya. - Look at this guy, he's 19 years old, and he's still filming pranks. You know, he's a posh twat, basically. - You okay? - Not really. - Everyone thinks you are behind all the other ghost stuff now, thanks to your prank. Jonts, there's millions of pranksters on the web. Not as many real ghosts. - Yeah, I'm gonna prove that there's a ghost here. A real one. - Yeah, how? - I'm paying Ilana Clark to do a video with us. - Ilana Clark? We should probably tell the others. - Oops. I'll go set up. - I'm getting something. He, no, she loves being around young people. - Does she have a name? - I'm getting a D. Which one of you is Pete? Poor, angry, scared Pete. - How camp is this bitch? - Wait, there's something else. Dawn. She's called Dawn. Dawn is here. - This is bad. This is really bad. - She's trapped and wants to be set free. - How do we do that? - What is happening? - What wants the ghost? We must... We, we must... - What? We must what? - Leave us alone! - Unmake me! Unmake me! Get out of me! - I need Becky! - No, look, come here. I got you. - No, I need Becky! - Ah, no one's believing this, are they? Come on! - Right, so what do we do? - Leave! Believe vengeful spirits use young people like batteries. You're in danger. Just leave before she gets any stronger. - We're leaving. - Hell no! ♪ That bitch is mental ♪ - Oh my God, did you guys just see what I saw? That girl,? What she was doing with the voice, and then her eyes, did you see it? She was like, "Bah!" And then she was there like that. Then she's like, "Bah!" This is next level. - Jonty, man. - Now that's what I'm talking about. - That was good. - Little effort goes a long way. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, Logan, he shit his pants. - No, I didn't. - If there's a ghost, we'll catch it, and if it's you pranking us, we'll catch you. Shooting on a 4K means you'll look like a movie star, which increases sales potential. - Wow. You really pay attention in lectures, don't you? - Yeah, I do. - But do you really think that I'm that evil that I would game everyone to this level? - You're not evil. I know evil. - Oh. Come on, then. What's your story? - You're rich. You're beautiful. You're white. People will always want your stories. That's just how the world works. I just need your story to make the money I need to tell mine. Get your filth off my bed. I needed cameras for watching Jonty. Turns out something else was watching me. - Do I think there were ghosts in Jonty's house? Well, I just happen to know that troubled young people often make their own ghosts. - Come on, babe. Come on. - Miss you. - But who knows? If Jonty can prove that there's a ghost in his house, then we might finally have to accept a spiritual world. Jonty might just end up changing the world. - Come on, do you want a selfie? Oh my God. Ah, those girls, too. Oh, this get a selfie. I watch your vlogs. I think you're brilliant. Do you like Mumford & Sons? I love the Mumford & Sons. - Jonty is playing a very dangerous game with his own psyche. He will need all the help that he can get. And Jonty, if you are watching, please, please, let me in. We can do this together. - Jonty! - Oh my god! Don't come in! Don't come in! - I think I've got the ghost! I've got Dawn! - Okay. Yeah. I'm coming. - Well, I'm not. - There she is. You all saw her, and there she is. - No, no, no. Zauna just isn't the kind of person who would pull a prank. - So I don't think that she would make a joke about something this serious. - Look, I swear it's not me this time. You guys are sick with all your tribute videos from all over the world. And as for the haters, keep hating. I don't care. I've got someone real in my life. - Do you wanna tell 'em? - No. You go for it. - We're official! - Hurray! - #Jamber. - Yeah, #Jamber! - I'm not saying anything, but I'm sure you guys will be very happy. - I know you guys want my opinion on a certain relationship. - Well, it's just not my place to say. - Jonty loved the fame, but I was angry that we only got a tiny glimpse of Dawn. We got more cameras, but I found out there are worse things than ghosts. - Oh no. I would like to go home. This is a very bad place. I don't like it here. - I know you don't like it, Grandma. And the doctor said you gotta try enjoy it more. They'll look after you. - I just want to go home, if you'll look after me. - You can't do that, Grandma. We sold the house, remember, for your care. - Who is that man behind you? - What man? - Who is that man behind you? I don't like him at all. - The doctor? Grandma, please, if you just- - Behind you. Behind you. Behind you! - Please, please, please, please, please do it. You've got to do it. - Pete! - I'm your ghost, bitch. You have to shh. - Pete! Pete! Don't do it. You don't have to do this. - I do, I do. You don't understand. - Zauna! Zauna! - Keep away from me! - Jonty, for fuck's sake! I'm gonnae grab him. You pin his arm down. - What, are you serious? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He stopped. For a moment, you stopped attacking me. Why? - Shh! She hears. She hears. - Dawn? The ghost? - There are worse things than ghosts. - Okay, why don't you give me that? - Zauna, don't. Now, Jonty! Bastard! Jonty, come on! - Stop! Stop. - I'm done. I'm done. - Please. You can change. Please don't! - Ah, that's bogging, innit? - Ooh, yeah, that is gonna need saying to, mate. Actually, would you mind just turning the camera off for me? Thank you. - Yeah. Cameras off, please. - Yeah? - Go ahead. - Have you guys got anywhere else you can stay tonight? - Yeah. My mum's on her way. - Maybe. - Not at all. - Um, the Plaza. These two as well. - The Plaza? You sure, man? - Of course, man. I'm so sorry about all this. - If you need help, speak to Becky. She's literally a lifesaver. But if I were you, I would never come back here. - Yeah, definitely. - Yeah, I am not coming back. - Yeah, we are gone. - Jonty, it's all right. - Jonty. Listen to me. Listen. - The way I see it is that Supernatural is the brand for the new generation. And you, Jonty, you're the voice of that generation. - Yeah, what we've been through has made me realise what's important to me. And I need you there, Amber. I want to do proper commitment this time. Okay? I really mean it. Zauna, hi, it's Jonty again. So, um, the sponsors will give you more cameras, more kit, and more control, 100%. Yeah, we will still do the videos, but you get to keep control of the documentary. Please believe me when I say that this is really going to be your story now. - Oh my God. Look. - Noting to see here. Come on, sheeple. Let us study in peace. Och, all right. Yeah! There's your dollar! - What are you doing? Oh, oh, wow. 10 days ago, there was an assault in here, a death. - So? Why are you here? Have you come to hang out with the brand ambassadors? So super. Ah. So natural. - What is going on? - Um, the attack pushed me past a million followers. - What a sick world we live in. - Yeah. We're all sponsored lifestyle vloggers now. Don't touch me. - Sorry. - And, um, no more ghosts. - Oh, really? - Yeah, well, Rattling Man was clearly behind the attack, and I'm not gonna make my rep exploiting the actions of an addict and a schizophrenic. - Yeah. This is a safe space now. - Huh. Great. Well that's wicked. But always, always know I'm here for you. So please, please, please share with all of your friends. We can make a change with this book. I mean, it's just 12.99. - Who gets therapy off someone that craves attention like that? - You did. What was she like when you had her? - You know, it was weird. Touchy-feely. Ah, I don't even remember. I was drinking so much back then, it's... - We were happy. We were friends. Rattling Man was dead. But that wasn't enough for Jonty. - Hi, Jonty. Just a quick question. Who is she? Fuckboy! - Okay. I was pretty sure that you had a girlfriend, though. - I really think you should bring back the ghost. - We miss the ghost. Where is the ghost? - If we ain't getting no boo, we want - Boobies! - Please? Come on, do it for me. - Nothing was ever enough for Jonty. He wanted it all. - So for the past 10 minutes, I've been listening to Amber crying and Pete shouting. I think it's my fault, but I don't know what I've done. Pete? Pete, what? Pete! Pete, no! Pete! Stop! - Every other comment on your blog is trolls wanting nudes of Amber. - You said those photos were just for us! - Hey, it's impossible. I couldn't have done it. Tell them why, Amber. - It would've been difficult. - How? - Because we took the pictures on my phone, so we needed my thumbprints to unlock the phone. - Aye, but you are sleeping together when you can't be arsed to hook up with one of your followers. So maybe a wee sleepy thumb done it. - I know I'm a dick, but I am not a weird, creepy dick. Okay, Amber, for fuck's sake, you know me! Zauna? Please, come on. - I need Becky. - I have to ask you this. - What? - You were really drunk last night. Sometimes when you drink you, you get suggestive when you're not getting the attention you want from Jonty. - Are you for real? Are you honestly that into money that you think I would do that? You know what? Maybe you leaked them. - Well, if we're gonnae start accusing everybody, why don't we start accusing the ghost? - Well, that's actually it. - Jonty don't start with me. - No, no, no. I swear, Pete, I'm not starting. What if there actually was something trying to communicate with us, something we've seen use laptops and phones before? - Oh. Man. - Shh. - What? - Ah, here we go. - She's back. - Jonty, you said no more ghosts! - This is gonna get us to two million. - I fucking knew this was coming! Ilana Clark said the ghosts use people as batteries. We need to get as many faces in here as possible. I swear, you know, I can prove that this is not me. - You're a piece of shit. - Unbelievable. I'm not clickbait. - Jonty, you're losing perspective. You need my guidance. - And you need his followers. - You're in danger! Guys, we should go talk in my safe space. - Okay, Jontsquad, it's time to get wasted, and use that vibe to raise Dawn from the motherfucking dead. Bad news: my hangover is apocalyptic. Good news? We're about to change the world. - What Jonty wants, Jonty gets. He got his party. He got his followers. He even got back inside Amber's head. So it was down to me to get Dawn. - Oy, mate, can we get a selfie? - Yeah. Yeah, man, come on. Get in. All right. - Hey! - Zauna, what's up? - I think I saw something. - Oy, mate, can we get a selfie? - Yeah. Yeah, man, come on. Get in. All right. - Hey! - What's up with you? You are toxic, mate. - Oy, mate, don't start, yeah? - No, no, no, we're good. You're a legend, mate. - Really? - Yeah. - All right. - Hey, it's Amber! - Has anyone seen Jonty? To be honest, like you said, proper commitment this time. - That's brilliant, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Fantastic! - I love you. - Hey, we need more shots, right? Shots! Shots! - Boo! - Zauna, what am I meant to be filming? - Get out of the way. Move! Fucking move! - Amber, Amber, Amber. Amber, Amber, Amber! Boo! - Oy! Turn the lights on! Zauna, are you getting this? Tell me you're getting this. - What happened, Dawn? What happened to you? - What? Happened? - So how did you do it? Did you spike everyone's drink? Helps for the mass hysteria, doesn't it? You trust fund fuck! - Jonty, Jonty, Jonty! Jonty! - Jonty started the day as a sleaze. He ended the night as a superstar. But Dawn didn't want us to sleep. She needed to tell us her story. - All right! That's it. Fuck this! - Come on. Don't be an idiot. - If there's any builders watching, Jonty's gonnae do a blog about how you're all legends. - Pete! - Amber. - No. No. - Move. Out of my way. - No, Pete! - Excuse me, darling. Ah, yes, I should've done this weeks ago! - Pete, stop it! - Go on. You might start believing me. - What? What the fuck? It's a cassette. - We need to play that tape. - No way! - What do we play it on? - The guy next door? - Retro hipster beard monkey? - Jonty. Do not push Play. - That's her. That's Dawn. - So what, did you pay an actress to do this, or something? - That is not acting. - Was that a second voice? - Come on, Zauna! - What's happening? She's putting something in her mouth. She's hurting her mouth. - She's killing herself! I don't like this! I wanna stop! - Unmake me. - What does that even mean? - Boom! For the first time in human history, full audio and visual proof of an actual ghost, with multiple eyewitnesses. Mike drops, internet breaks, comment below. - You did it, bro. - You did it, man. - This guy's either some evil kinda genius, or he's just proved that ghosts exist. - Okay, so now I'm a little bit impressed. - As far as I'm concerned, I think ghosts do exist. - Wow. The world's a different place now. - Golf clap. Golf clap. - You're taking over, bro. - I really cannot wait to meet you. Let's get Dawn on TV. And you, of course. - What did you do with the cassette? You don't sell it to that tawdry Edward Lee Show, did you? - No, no. I have it here. - Great. I have a safe in my office. - No good, Becky. - Maybe if I was with you, I could make sure that this awful Edward man wasn't exploiting you. - Oh, but Becky, that would mean you were appearing on a TV show watched by millions of people. And what could you possibly gain from that? - Can't I just want you to be safe? Please. - Tonight is more than just a haunting. It's a social media global event. And when these terrified young people asked for my help, I could not say no. Intriguing. The images of tongue mutilation suggest a silencing of the spirit ritual. And the cassette was in this space here? May I see it? I believe this was used to trap an organic energy field. Paranormal science has proven that energy fields follow the victim wherever they go. Unless you trap that field first. With me is notorious social media influencer, Jonty Craig. We're going to attempt to communicate with Dawn with a cassette of our own. - Hi, Edward. Yeah, I'm so happy you're here. - Stop! Did anyone hear that? - I heard something, I think. Amber? - Yes. - Dawn, this is Edward Lee. I'm sure you know of me. Are you there? Will you communicate? Will you play us some of your rave music? - And cut. - How was that? Okay. - We need this shot, all right? - Yeah, I got it. - Good. - Go again, Zauna. - Hey. How'd you get a job in TV? - Same as everyone else, I suppose. Mum and Dad knew someone. - What's in the folder? - This, oh, I just, I just tidy up the stuff the private detectives find for Edward's big, dramatic reveal. - What did they find? - Um, So, you know that guy, Jim, that broke in? - Yeah. He tried to kill me. - Oh shit, yeah. Duh! Um, well, his mum found small photos of his college days. - There are photos? Can I see? - You'll have to wait for Edward's big reveal. And Zauna, could you cry? We'd really love you to be crying. Thanks. - My story is the big story. These people are turning it into fricking circus, Pete. - No, Zauna. You're talking about death. That's court rooms and lawyers and prison. I'm not going to prison. - Just say you don't know anything. They'll believe you. - You are so stubborn. It's not like I've got a choice. D'you what, actually, this Edward guys asking for it. Ah, unmake me! - I believe you're experiencing interference from a semi-sentient energy field. - Ah, mate, you're a spanner. Excuse me, guys. - Delete that take. What the hell are we doing here? If there's nothing to get, why are we even here? - No, we won't be needing that. - Oh, really? - Mr. Lee, look, I know we didn't see anything tonight, but there is something here, isn't there? - Maybe. Or maybe Jonty has been pranking the world on a genius level, and when Edward Lee came along, he backed down. - I needed you to find the ghost. - I'll tell you what I do know. There are far worse things than ghosts in this world. And thanks to your obnoxious videos, they know exactly where to find you. - Och, don't listen to him, Jonty. You're just pissed off 'cause we ruined your show. You're a fraud. - You all have no idea what I've seen. - Dawn! Dawn! Everyone hates me now. You owe me this. Come out for a selfie, yeah? I know you're in there. I know you're in there. Why aren't you hearing me? - So you gonnae tell him what you stole from Edward? - Hmm-mm. No, he's been drinking all night. Let's get him to bed. Tomorrow we go live. - I'll go get him. - Come on out, Dawn. Dawn! - So we have something big. Bigger than Edward Lee? You're a clown, mate. You think you can come in here, show me how to- - Jonty. - So now for the epic reveal. Zauna got access to some of Edward's secret files. - Way back in the '90s, the man that attacked me, Jim, lived here with two girls. - Jontsquad, Dawn's flatmate was none other than our very own mental health officer, Becky Dubar. - Becky? - It's on me to tell the truth about Dawn. Interview me. Your followers deserve to know the whole truth. My poor Dawn. So depressed. I thought it was just a comedown from all the pills, but she was disintegrating. - And how did she die? Oh, she said she was learning something called bloody magic, that she was keen to turn herself into a ghost and haunt me forever. That's what you heard on the tapes. That was her recording herself killing herself. - That's terrible, Becky. - And I was so frightened of her ghost following me that I, I built this sigil thing into your wall and... - Becky, we can stop if you want. - Ah, it's fine. - So Dawn is in our flat trying to feed off our energy? - Oh, more than just feeding. You see, Jim was obsessed with Dawn. The attack on you, Zauna, that was all on Dawn's orders. - What? - She wants you to feel her pain, because she then uses that to control you and then to kill you. You need to move out. - Yeah, we can't do that. The story's spreading all over the world now. - Yes. And that is why I need to be with you all. - Yeah, I'm sorry, Becky, but the sponsors decide who we make videos with now. - This is not for my vlog! This was never about my stupid, tacky vlog! - Then why do you need to be there? - To protect you! I'm sorry. It's just, I want to protect you. - Zauna, come on, turn the camera off. Zauna! Turn it off. It's amazing she survived that. - I can't deal. Yeah, I actually can't deal. - Then deal, Amber, because this can be worth millions. - Amber, Becky's coming here tonight. You'll be safe over here. - No. I'm leaving. And so is Jonty. - What? - Are you for real? - Are you joking? Let's leave now, together, and show the world that what we've got is bigger than all of this. Yeah? - And that's how I found myself on the healer's path. - Fascinating. Dawn, ya spooky bitch! Becky's here. Are you coming out? - Here's to you loons. Come on! Cheers - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Let's make a cassette. - What? - How drunk are you? - Nothing much is happening. Let's make cassette and, uh, bring this to a close. - Well, is it going to be a live webcast? - Uh, no. The sponsors want more input with the edits. Pete's language. - Ach, fuck 'em. Dicks. - We can work together. - Okay. Ready? Are you with us now? - Inside my pocket, I'm holding up fingers. How many? - Do you forgive me? - Are we safe with you? - Did you hear that? - There's nothing there, babes. - Go back. - Do you forgive me? - She's scared. - Are we safe with you? - She said, "Not safe," to my question. - Really? Oh my. Oh, I feel this strange... Oh God! Oh! Oh God, I'm so sorry. I just need to chillax. Oh! - So it ends with a whimper. - So no one believed me? Jonty, erm, where are you sleeping? - I'm just in such a confused place right now. I wouldn't want you to get the wrong signals. - Yeah. Night. - Sleep. Sleep. - How was it with Jonty? - He cares more about his followers than me. - Oh. - He's just sick in the head, and I keep believing his bullshit. - I had your phone. - What? - I posted the nudes of you. - Huh? - And every time you came into therapy, I got more and more into your head. I made sure that you couldn't cope unless you had Jonty's approval. - No. You've had too much to drink. Can you just leave my room, please? - There's so little left of you. - Get out of my room! - Please. Amber. You need to change. - What's happening? - Oh, I'm making you, I'm making you into something else. - I don't understand. - I make ghosts. I make ghosts. - Pete! Jonty! - Zauna! - What's wrong? - What are you doing? - Amber. - She's safe. - Move now! Amber! - Zauna! - Amber! Amber! - She's killed herself. Jonty, get in here and look at what you've done! - It's Dawn. Downstairs, now! - I can't deal with it. Please. - Jonty, come here! - Call the police! - Hey, guys. - It's lighter fluid. - It's everywhere. - Are you taking the piss? - Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete. - Check out my new vlog, guys. It's the best one yet. Lol. - With me now is Becky Dubar, who has set the place to go up in flames. - No sudden moves, or boom! - Now, you're going to reveal your big secret. - Okay, um, here goes. Since the 1990s, I have been making ghosts. - Clever you old you! How do you do that? - Well, in order to make a spirit you have to... Break a spirit. You find a damaged individual. The younger the better. - Oh, yes. I mean they're quite gullible, aren't they? They're quite easily led when they're young. - Then you change them until they have no will. I mean, I can even get them to take their own lives if I need to. Then you pop their souls onto a cassette, and they become ghosts. Then I perform a little ritual just to make sure that, um, they can't easily lead someone directly to me, and then their souls give me power. - Change. - Am I right in thinking it's been a difficult journey? - My first attempt at making a ghost was my best friend, Dawn, but Dawn didn't manifest for almost 20 years. So I guess you could say that my first attempt was an epic fail. - Oh, poor you. But 20 years later, Jonty comes along. - Jonty, with his videos and his lights and his followers! Listen, he kept Dawn for himself, but that was all meant to be for me, for me! Not cool, people! Not cool! So now Jonty has to choose between the lives of his friends or video of their deaths in order to become the most famous man in the world. - But surely his friends mean so much to him. - Jonty is an influencer. He's changed the world. He could be the voice of a new generation. Why choose friends when you could have 10 million followers? - Jonty! Jonty! - Hundreds of millions of followers? - Becky. You are a genius, all right? I'm betting that your IQ is Einstein level. But the chemicals in your brain are unbalanced. You cannot tell reality from fantasy right now. - Sometimes I think that, too. - See? That's what I'm saying. You're just in a dark place. Look, let's get you outta here, and we can get you professional help. - But no more magics, then? - No, darling. - Oh, you just think I'm a little bit bonkers? - No, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen. It's okay. Whatever it is, we can find out together. Okay? Okay? Hey, shh. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, listen. Jonty, run! Take Zauna and get out! Call the police! - Change! Sit down, Peter. - All right. Okay. - Pete? - Here you go, son. - Ah. Thanks, Mum. - Pete, no! Pete, you'll vomit! No, no! - Pete, don't swallow. Pete! Jonty! Fucking hell, man, you coward! Come on! Come on! Open. Please. - I can't. - Pete. Pete. Open. No. No, Pete. You bitch! - Come on, Jonty. Help me set up the cameras. - Get off! - Jim's attack got you hundreds of thousands of followers, Dawn's appearance millions. Just imagine what you'll get when you post the ghost maker burning her final victims. - Jonty, do you listen to her. - Ow! - Stop! - What? - Stop? - Oh. You want to help Zauna? Right. It's just, I've seen how you let her use you. - Don't listen to your her, Jonty. - You film her death, everyone will know you. Everyone will love you. Or you give up your beautiful young life and die in screaming agony, all for this? - Okay, I'll do it. I'll shoot the video. - Jonty! - It's not your story. It's mine. - No! It's Dawn's! - Oh, you, give that to me! No, no, no, no! - Oh, give it to me. - Zauna, run! Go! Go! - Jonty! - Jonty! - Ms. Matthews, Ms. Matthews, where's Jonty, where's Jonty? - Jonty! - Can you tell us where Jonty is? Ms. Matthews, please talk to us. - Zauna, Zauna, come with me, come with me. Zauna, follow me. - A secondary gas explosion led to further casualties. - All footage from the night of the murders has been mysteriously erased. - Police have yet to reveal how many bodies have been found. - Since his disappearance, Jonty Craig has surpassed 100 million followers. But has the price of fame cost him his life? - The media claims that we murdered Becky, that we murdered our friends. Now you know the truth. We were not Becky's murderers. We were her victims. This is the truth. Share it. You got that? - We just have to get it out there. What's going on? Cut the feed. - Hey, guys. Are you okay? - I said shut it down! - I'm trying! - I'm worried about you. Especially you, Zauna. Guys, we should go talk in my safe space. - Becky, wait. I'll come. I think it could, uh, could help me. - Zauna, that's, that's bloody magic. I'm so proud of you. - I don't remember this. - You went to see her? - I don't remember any of this. - I had to learn how to help people change themselves. - Jonty, I'm so sorry. I don't remember. - Zauna. It's time to make a change. - Zauna! Zauna! Please! Stop!
