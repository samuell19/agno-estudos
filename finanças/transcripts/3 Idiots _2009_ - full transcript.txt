He is in Shimla Free as the wind was he Like a soaring kite was he Where did he go... let's find him Free as the wind was he Like a soaring kite was he Where did he go... let's find him We were led by the path we took While he carved a path of his own Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he We fretted about the morrow He simply reveled in today Living each moment to the fullest Where did he come from... He who touched our hearts and vanished... Where did he go... let's find him In scorching Sun, he was like a patch of shade... In an endless desert, like an oasis... On a bruised heart, like soothing balm was he Afraid, we stayed confined in the well Fearless, he frolicked in the river Never hesitating to swim against the tide He wandered lonesome as a cloud ...Yet he was our dearest friend Where did he go... let's find him Rancho Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad He was as unique as his name From birth we were taught - Life is a race Run fast or you 'll be trampled Even to be born, one had to race 300 million sperms 1978. I was born at 5.15 pm At 5.16, my father announced And my fate was sealed What I wanted to be... no one asked Raju Rastogi... Ranchhoddas Chanchad Room number? D-26 C'mon I'm Man Mohan.

Your Majesty, thou art great Accept this humble offering Ha... here's a He-Man What a pretty piece. Cute and compact A campus tradition: On Day 1... Freshmen must pay their respects to Seniors in their underwear This is when we first saw Rancho Spiderman Batman Fresh meat Greetings. Drop your pants, get stamped Name? 'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad' What a mouthful; Needs serious cramming Come on: pants off Being stubborn? Wet pants not good, kiddo. Take them off Aal izz well - What's that? Aal izz Well What did he say? Someone tell him. Hey James Bond Make him understand Take off your pants or they are going to piss on you Hey 007! Ashamed to speak Hindi? Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda, studied in Pondicherry so little slow in Hindi So explain slowly. No hurry Feeling cold? Pray undress or he'll do 'urine-expulsion' on you Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion'; A true linguist in the land of engineers! Hey, come out of there Come out or... or I'll do 'urine-expulsion' on your door If you aren't out by the count of ten I'll do 'urine-expulsion' on your door all semester One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Salt water is a great conductor of electricity. 8th Grade Physics We had studied it. He applied it Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe was the Director of ICE Students called him Virus, computer Virus Virus on the way, with eggs Freshmen are summoned. Come quickly Virus was the most competitive man we had ever seen He couldn 't bear anyone getting ahead of him To save time, his shirts had Velcro and his ties had hooks He'd trained his mind to write with both hands simultaneously Everyday at 2 pm he took a 7 1/2 minute power nap with an opera as lullaby Govind, his valet, had instructions to carry out all unproductive tasks such as shaving, nail-cutting etc What is this? - Sir, nest Whose? - A koel bird's nest, sir Wrong A koel bird never makes her own nest She lays her eggs in other nests And when they hatch, what do they do? They push the other eggs out of the nest Competition over Their life begins with murder. That's nature Compete or die You also are like the koel birds And these are the eggs you smashed to get into ICE Don't forget, ICE gets 400,000 applications a year and only 200 are selected: You; And these? Finished. Broken eggs My son... he tried for three years Rejected. Every time Remember, life is a race If you don't run fast, you'll get trampled Let me tell you a very interesting story This is an astronaut pen Fountain pens and ballpoint pens don't work in outer space So scientists spent millions to invent this pen It can write at any angle, in any temperature, in zero gravity One day, when I was a student the Director of our institute called me He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.' I said, 'Yes sir' 'Come here;' I got scared He showed me this pen He said, 'This is a symbol of excellence' 'I give it to you' 'When you come across an extraordinary student like yourself ...pass it onto him' For 32 years, I've been waiting for that student But no luck Anyone here, who'll strive to win this pen? Good. Put your hands down Shall I post it on the notice board? Hands down One question, sir Sir, if pens didn't work in outer space why didn't the astronauts use a pencil? They'd have saved millions I will get back to you on this He zaps a Senior's privates at night fingers the Director in the day. Best avoid him You deflated Virus's erection Your Majesty, thou art great. Accept this humble offering Buzz off. You don't have school? Who'll pay for it? Your pop? Keep off my dad! - Relax For school you don't need tuition money, just a uniform Pick a school, buy the uniform, slip into class In that sea of kids, no one will notice If I get caught? - Then new uniform, new school See that? - He was different... He challenged conventions at every stage A free-spirited bird had landed in Virus's nest We were robots, blindly following our professors ' commands He was the only one who was not a machine What is a machine? Why're you smiling? Sir, to study Engineering was a childhood dream I'm so happy to be here finally No need to be so happy. Define a machine A machine is anything that reduces human effort Will you please elaborate? Anything that simplifies work, or saves time, is a machine It's a warm day, press a button, get a blast of air The fan... A machine; Speak to a friend miles away. The telephone... A machine! Compute millions in seconds. The calculator... A machine! We're surrounded by machines From a pen's nib to a pants' zip - all machines Up and down in a second. Up, down, up, down... What is the definition? I just gave it to you, sir You'll write this in the exam? This is a machine: up, down... Idiot; Anybody else? Yes? Sir, machines are any combination of bodies so connected that their relative motions are constrained and by which means, force and motion may be transmitted and modified as a screw and its nut, or a lever arranged to turn about a fulcrum or a pulley about its pivot, etc especially, a construction, more or less complex consisting of a combination of moving parts, or simple mechanical elements, as wheels, levers, cams etc Wonderful Perfect. Please sit down Thank you But sir, I said the same thing, in simple language If you prefer simple language, join an Arts and Commerce college But sir, one must get the meaning too What's the point of blindly cramming a bookish definition You think you're smarter than the book? Write the textbook definition, mister, if you want to pass But there are other books... - Get out! Why? In simple language: Out; Idiot; So, we were discussing the machine... Why're you back? I forgot something What? Instruments that record, analyze, summarize, organize debate and explain information; that are illustrated, non-illustrated hard-bound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed with foreword, introduction, table-of-contents, index that are intended for the enlightenment, understanding enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through the sensory route of vision, sometimes touch What do you mean? Books, sir I forgot my books. May I? Couldn't you ask simply? I tried earlier, sir. It simply didn't work Professors kept Rancho mostly out... seldom in When thrown out of one class, he'd slip into another He said: First year or fourth year, it's knowledge. Just grab it He was unlike any of us We fought for a shower every morning He'd bathe wherever he found water Morning, sir Machines were his passion When he spotted them, he opened them Some he could re-assemble... some he couldn 't There was another, just like him Joy Lobo Sir. Excuse me, sir Mr. Joy Lobo; Sir, if I could know the convocation dates... Why? Dad wants to make train reservations I'm the first engineer from my village. Everyone wants to attend In that case, call your dad Please hurry up. Don't waste my time Hello Dad, the Director wants to speak to you Joy; Mr. Lobo, your son won't graduate this year What happened, sir? He has violated all deadlines Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project He is making some nonsense helicopter I suggest you don't book your tickets. I'm so sorry Sir, I am this close, sir - Is your project ready? Is your project ready? - Sir, see it once, please Submit it, and we'll consider Sir, a small extension... - Why, why should I? After dad's stroke, I couldn't focus for two months Did you stop eating? No Stopped bathing? So why stop studying? Sir, I'm very close. See it once, please... Mr. Lobo; Sunday afternoon, my son fell off a train and died Monday morning, I taught a class. So don't give me that nonsense I can give you sympathy, not an extension Sir... I'm very close... Lifelong I lived The life of another For just one moment Let me live as I... Lifelong I lived The life of another For just one moment Let me live as I... Give me some sunshine Give me some rain Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again Give me some sunshine Give me some rain Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again Dude's come up with an amazing design A wireless camera atop a helicopter Can be used for traffic updates, security... Wow! But Virus said it's an impractical design, it won't fly It will fly; We'll make it fly Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise We'll fly it up to his window and capture his reaction If we work on his project, who'll work on ours? Tests, vivas, quizzes - 42 exams per semester You scare easily, bro Take your hand, put it over your heart, and say, 'Aal izz well' All is well? - Aal izz well Words of wisdom from His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas We had an old watchman in our village On night patrol, he'd call out, 'Aal izz well' And we slept peacefully. Then there was a theft and we learned that he couldn't see at night; He'd just yell 'Aal izz well', and we felt secure That day I understood this heart scares easily You have to trick it However big the problem, tell your heart, 'All is well, pal' That resolves the problem? No. But you gain courage to face it Learn it up, bro. We're gonna really need it here When life spins out of control Just let your lips roll Let your lips roll And whistle away the toll When life spins out of control Just let your lips roll Just let your lips roll And whistle away the toll Yell: All is Well... The chicken's clueless about the egg's fate Will it hatch or become an omelette No one knows what the future holds So let your lips roll And whistle away the toll Whistle away the toll Yell: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Hey mate: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Confusion and more confusion No sign of any solution Ah... finally a solution But wait... what was the question? If the timid heart with fear is about to die Then con it bro, with this simple lie Heart's an idiot, it will fall under that spell Let your lips roll And whistle away the toll Whistle away the toll Yell: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Hey mate: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Blew the scholarship on booze But that did not dispel my blues Holy incense lit up my plight And yet God's nowhere in sight The lamb is clueless for what it's destined Will it be served on skewers or simply minced No one knows what the future holds So let your lips roll And whistle away the toll Whistle away the toll Yell: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Hey mate: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well When life spins out of control Just let your lips roll Just let your lips roll And whistle away the toll All is Well The chicken's clueless about the egg's fate Will it hatch or become an omelette No one knows what the future holds So let your lips roll And whistle away the toll Whistle away the toll Eureka! Eureka; Yell: All is Well Hey Mrs. Chicken: All is Well Hey Mr. Lamb: All is Well Hey bro: All is Well Hey, take it up to Joy's window Take it higher Look at Silencer: the nude dude; Joy, come out Come to the window Joy, look outside Good news, sir The police and Joy's father have no clue Everyone thinks this is suicide The post mortem report - Cause of Death: Intense pressure on windpipe resulting in choking All think the pressure on the jugular killed him What about the mental pressure for the last four years? That's missing in the report Engineers are a clever bunch They haven't made a machine to measure mental pressure If they had, all would know... this isn't suicide... it's murder How dare you blame me for Joy's suicide? If one student can't handle pressure, is it our fault? Life is full of pressures. Will you always blame others? I don't blame you, sir. I blame the system Look at these statistics - India ranks N0.1 in suicides Every 90 minutes, a student attempts suicide Suicide is a bigger killer than disease Something's terribly wrong, sir I can't speak for the rest but this is one of the finest colleges in the country I've run this place for 32 years We were ranked 28th. Now we're N0.1 What's the point, sir? Here they don't discuss new ideas or inventions They discuss grades, jobs, settling in the USA They teach how to get good scores. They don't teach Engineering Now you will teach me how to teach? No sir, I... Sir, my paper... Vaidyanathan, please sit down Here is a self-proclaimed professor who thinks he is better than our highly qualified teachers Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad will teach us Engineering We do not have all day You have 30 seconds to define these terms You may refer to your books Raise your hand if you get the answer Let's see who comes first, who comes last Your time starts... now Time up Time up, sir No one got the answer? Now rewind your life by a minute When I asked this question, were you excited? Curious? Thrilled that you'd learn something new? Anyone? ... Sir? No. You all got into a frantic race What's the use of such methods, even if you come first Will your knowledge increase? No, just the pressure This is a college, not a pressure cooker Even a circus lion learns to sit on a chair in fear of the whip But you call such a lion 'well trained', not 'well educated' Hello! This is not a philosophy class. Just explain those two words Sir, these words don't exist These are my friends' names. Farhan and Raju Quiet; Nonsense! Is this how you'll teach Engineering? Sir, I wasn't teaching you Engineering You're an expert at that I was teaching you... how to teach And I'm sure one day you'll learn because unlike you, I never abandon my weak students Bye, sir Quiet; Quiet, I said I regret to inform you that your son... Farhan... Raju... has fallen into bad company Without urgent corrective steps, his future will be ruined Virus 's letters dropped on our homes like atom bombs Hiroshima and Nagasaki plunged into gloom Our parents invited us - for a dressing down Come in See that? We could afford just one air-conditioner We put it in Farhan's room, so he could study in comfort I didn't buy a car. I manage with a scooter We put all our money into Farhan's education We sacrificed our comforts for Farhan's future. U nderstand? You took these pictures, Farhan? He had that useless obsession for a while Went around taking pictures of animals Wanted to be a wildlife photographer Son, what was your score that year? 91% Hear that? Straight drop from 94% to 91% You find it funny? No sir, sorry. I'm just amazed at the photos Why make him an engineer... Why not a wildlife photographer? Enough; I humbly request you - Don't ruin my son's future Food's on the table, boys. C'mon If you ever visit again, do eat with us Dad denied us a meal... So, to fill our bellies with food... and ears with more reprimands, we reached Raju's house Raju's house was straight out of a 50's black and white film A small, dingy room... a paralyzed father... a coughing mother... and an unwed sister A sofa sprouting springs... a 24 hour water supply - from the leaking roof Mother was a retired school teacher and a tireless complainer Father was once a postmaster Paralysis shut down his body partly... his salary completely. And the sister... Kammo's turned 28. They demand a car in dowry If you don't study and earn, how will she marry? Some okra? Okra is now 12 /- per kilo, cauliflower is 10/- It's daylight robbery; What will we eat if we get warnings from your college? Mom! Cottage cheese? Cottage cheese should be sold at the jewelers, in velvet pouches Cottage cheese? - No, no, it's ok Mom, please Alright, I'll shut up Earn for the family, slave like a maid and then take the vow of silence If not with my son, with whom do I share my woes: his friends? Hey Raju We were in a huge dilemma Do we comfort our friend or console his mom? Screw it, we thought, let's focus on the cottage cheese Even his eczema cream costs 55 /- now Another roti? No, thank you. We're through Okra for 12 /- - Cauliflower for 10 /- At least you were offered a meal Unlike your sadistic dad... 'Hitler' Qureshi; And your mom is Mother Teresa... Feeding us 'eczema roti'! Don't poke fun at my mom; - Enough, you guys I'm famished. Let's eat out It's month end. Who'll pay? His Mother Teresa? To eat out, you don't need money. Just a uniform. Look... C'mon - Come Good evening, good evening Oh, U ncle Three large vodkas. - Half soda, half water If we're caught, we're dead What's for starters? - Get double portions Leave this here and start some peppy music Pia, what the hell! Why're you wearing this ancient piece of junk? What'll people say: My fiancee... a doctor in the making, wearing a cheap, 200 /- watch; Please take it off. Thank you Hi handsome Hey Aunty. You're looking good Don't miss my set, darling - Rubies? From Mandalay - Mandalay... Wow; Hey, let's go meet David - Of course Excuse me Yes? Flowers May I take the glass? - Why? So you don't break it on my head Why would I do that? For the free advice I'll now impart What? Don't marry that ass Excuse me? He's not a human, he's a price tag He'll turn your life into a nightmare of brands and prices He'll ruin your life. Your future will be finished Want a demonstration? Shall I find out the price of his shoes? I won't ask. He'll announce it himself What the hell... Mint sauce on my $300 shoes! Run for your life; It's free advice. Take it or leave it Genuine Italian leather - hand-stitched; Dad, are they your guests? My students. What're they doing here? Hold on, Dad These beans smell great No room for roti - Just pile it on Hi - Hey That was an eye-opener. Thank you so much It was my moral responsibility Can I ask you for little more help? Dad won't let me break off this engagement You explain so well. Can you give him a demo too? Certainly. Raju, the mint sauce You're really sweet Where is your daddy? - Right behind you Aal izz well Run for your life; It's free advice. Take it or leave it What're you doing here? We'll hand these gifts to the couple I'll do that for you. It's my sister's wedding Sister? Sir, what's the sum total of your daughters? Empty. No gift cheques Forgot the cheques, Raju ...Farhan? We didn't invite you, you must be from the groom's side No sir, we're here as the emissaries of science How? Can you explain? Dad, he explains superbly. I'm sure he'll give us a demo Won't you? Well, Delhi has plenty of power cuts that... disrupt wedding celebrations So I thought of making an inverter that... draws power from guests' cars I see Wow So where's the inverter? Sir, the design is ready Where's the design, Farhan? I gave you the design - I gave it to Raju Raju, design? Never mind the design. I'll make the inverter and show you You can only invent stories, not an inverter I'll make one, I promise And I'll name it after you. After all, it was invented... at your daughter's wedding. So it'll be an honor... Farhan, Raju. I'll see you in my office tomorrow Sir, what was the cost per plate? We'll reimburse you ...in installments We'll never crash a wedding again - Not even my own In fact, I won't even marry. Nor will he Uh... right. No marriage Your parents shouldn't have married either The world would have to feed two less idiots Sit! Pay attention This is Ranchhoddas's father's monthly income Couple of zeroes less, and it's still a sizeable income But erase another zero, and I would worry a little Isn't that your father's income, Farhan? Yes, sir Now take away another zero... and that's your family income, Raju Rastogi Big reason to worry Take my advice and shift into Chatur Ramalingam's room Exams are here. Stay with Rancho and you're sure to fail Want a shave? - No, sir Then get lost! Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's move to split us. Divide and rule I have to worry He grades us, and I need good grades for a good job Unlike you, I don't have a rich dad I can live off Shut up, Raju Must we follow all his hogwash? 'Aal izz well' I won't be his flunky... like you You're crossing the line - No, I'm drawing one I have a family to support Dad's medicines swallow up mom's pension My sis can't marry because they want a car in dowry Mom hasn't bought a single saree in five years Now don't get your mom's wardrobe into the debate By the way, how many sarees per annum is reasonable? Hey... no wisecracks about mom We'll study with all our heart, but not just for grades To quote a Wise One: Study to be accomplished, not affluent Follow excellence. And success will chase you, pants down; Which Wise One says this? His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas? Go rot in the bogs; Raju, don't stress. We'll top our class. Nothing is impossible Oh yeah? Shove this back into the tube Raju got onto another train His travails with Chatur began. Yes, I mean travails, not travels Chatur was called 'Silencer' To sharpen his memory, he popped pills from a local quack And then let off silent... but lethal farts I didn't do it... Raju? He always blamed others for the output Silencer crammed 18 hours a day On exam eve, he would distract others His belief: There are only two ways of topping Elevate your own grades or shrink your opponents' grades Rancho decided to subdue Silencer and rescue Raju... with one master plan Our Director has unceasingly served... 'Served' means... Damn the meaning, I'll memorize it Chatur was the introductory speaker at the Teachers' Day function To impress Virus, he got his speech written by the librarian... in highbrow Hindi Hello. Hold on. Chatur, call for you Please collect the printout. I'll be right back Oh... the things I have to do... Mr. Dubey, the Director was remembering you Really? - Yes. Just now I'll see him right away. Give this to Chatur Hello. Hello - Hello, Mr. Ramalingam? Yes? I'm calling from the police station Are you from Uganda? - Yes sir Your life is in danger - What? ... How? Listen carefully, or else... you'll get killed as you step out of the college gate Why? What happened? While Chatur was kept engaged Rancho altered a few words in his speech, for eg... 'served' became 'screwed' Yes sir? Who are you? - Dubey. Librarian I'm permanent staff, sir Congratulations Hold on a moment. The chief is on the other line Excuse me, sir Yes... so where was I? You said I may die... outside the gate Right. As you get out of the gate, you'll see a traffic signal Traffic signal. Ok When it turns red, all the cars will halt Ok. Then? Then cross the road with great caution Because son, in rush hour if a car hits you, you're dead What nonsense! I know that You know that? Excellent. Then you're safe my boy From the librarian, Silencer You don't call me that, Chanchad Hey. The Director said he didn't call for me Who said 'called'? I just said he 'remembered' you Remembered? Rascals; Distinguished Mr. Chairperson Chief guest, the Honorable Minister of Education respected teachers and friends ICE has now soared beyond the stratosphere The credit goes solely to Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe. Give him a big hand Sir, the voice is his but the words are mine He's a great guy, really you are For 32 years, he has unceasingly screwed students He means: 'served' students I'm sure his endeavors will continue We are astounded at how one man, in one lifetime can screw so many, so well With rigorous training he's built up his stamina He's spent every living minute just screwing Let's replicate his methods Tomorrow ICE students will go across the globe Wherever we go, we promise to screw We'll hoist this screwer's flag all over the world We'll show the world that our capacity to screw... cannot be matched by any student... anywhere on the planet Mr. Minister. Good evening You have given this institution what it sorely needs Booty, funds - Bosom It's booty, stupid. Bosom means... What nonsense! That's insulting Everyone has a bosom, but it remains pocketed No one offers it so readily Vulgar fellow; You have generously offered your bosom... to this relentless screwer Now see how he makes it grow Is this what you teach here, Director? On this august occasion, here's a Sanskrit verse... Listen to this: the might of his fart in verse A good loud fart is honorable 'Fart'? Go, Silencer A medium fart is tolerable Softer windbreaks are terrible And the silent ones unbearable What did I do? That's what mindless cramming does to you Cramming may see you through four years of college but it will 'screw' you for the next 40 years He still doesn't get it 'Medium fart is tolerable'... Unbelievable; You're a poet, Rancho. How did you think of this? That was fun. He didn't know what hit him You swines! What did I ever do to you? Sorry man. Don't take it personally I will Chatur Ramalingam will never forget this insult I'll think of it every minute, every second of my life Sorry man. That was a demo for Raju: Don't cram blindly Understand and enjoy the wonders of Science I'm not here to enjoy Science So You're here to screw Science Go ahead. Laugh at my methods But one day these methods will bring me success That day I'll laugh and you'll cry You're on the wrong track again. Don't chase success Become a good engineer and success will chase you These ideals don't work in the real world You take your train, I'll take mine Ten years from now we'll meet at the same station Same day. Same place. We'll see who's more successful you... or I Have the balls? C'mon, bet; It's a challenge Watch it! What's he writing? Don't forget this date I'm not used to such expensive gifts, Suhas Get used to them, Pia You're gonna be Suhas Tandon's wife Where's the bill, man? I'll be back You changed the speech? - What? Don't lie Um... Yeah What's your problem with dad? - I have no problem I'm making an inverter named after him. Look... Oh Why're you harassing him? 'Cause he runs a factory, not a college Churning out asses. Like that one She destroyed it, man How dare you call him an ass? He is one! First Engineering, then MBA then becomes a banker in the USA Because it rakes in more money? Life for him is just a profit-loss statement He sees profit in you, so he's with you Director's daughter, doctor in the making... Good for his image! It's not you he cares for Who do you think you are? What do you mean he doesn't care for me? New watch? One moment You always need a demo Hey Suhas Where were you? She's looking for her watch What? You lost the watch Never mind. Get another It cost 400,000; Mine's just 250/- but keeps the same time How could you be so careless, Pia This callous attitude is disgusting. It's disrespectful That was a limited edition watch Now wear your ancient piece of junk at dinner What're you staring at? Here come the tears! Real mature, Pia I can't handle this Stop crying and look for it Find another wrist for this watch... Ass; Hey, you're awesome. Called him an ass to his face Get lost It's too noisy here She's saying 'Thank you', I hear 'Get lost' I said 'Get lost' - Don't get so uptight Actually, you never really loved him What do you mean? When you see him, do the winds whisper a melody? Your scarf flies in slow motion? The Moon appears gigantic? That happens in movies, not in life Happens in life too - if you love a person ...not an ass Hello. What? Oh God; Ok, I'm on my way You're a medical student, right? Need your help It's an emergency, please - What? Please come with me. What's that oath you doctors take - You'll never deny a patient help... The Hippocratic Oath Please help me, it's an emergency You gatecrash my sister's wedding, break off my engagement... my dad is popping BP pills because of you... and here I am, helping you; Unbelievable; This Hippocratic Oath - It's really done us in! Where's Raju, ma'am? - Gone to get a cab Called the ambulance two hours ago In this country, pizza reaches in 30 minutes but an ambulance...; He needs hospitalization. Urgently Hey stop; Move, it's an emergency! Move... move... Move... move... Doctor, emergency! That's the patient Keep this. Hey, here's Raju What the hell; You brought dad on the scooter Should I've sent him by courier? No wisecracks on dads profession! Where is he? Go ask the doctor Close call, Pia.

Not there My heart sank Not 'cause our ranks tanked, but 'cause our friend flunked There's a mistake. It's not possible. It's injustice What's Silencer howling about? He got the second rank Who's first? Rancho Rancho? Move aside We learned a lesson in Human Behavior: Your friend fails, you feel bad. Your friend tops, you feel worse We were sad. Two others were sadder Ranchhoddas Chanchad. Front row. Right of the Director Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat Sahili Rao. Third row... Sir, why this seating according to rank? Any problem with that? Yes, this grading system is like a caste system A-graders: Masters C-graders: Slaves It's not nice, sir - You have a better idea? Yes. Results should not be displayed at all Why publicise someone's flaws? If your iron count is low, will the doctor prescribe tonic... or air your report on TV You see, sir? So basically, what you are saying is I should personally go to each student's room and whisper in his ears... 'You have come first'; 'You're second'; 'Oh, I'm so sorry, you have failed' No sir, I mean grades create a divide I've topped, so I'm next to you My pals came last, they're in the back corner At least they're in the corner More time with you, and they'll be out of the photo They will neither pass, nor get a job They'll get jobs, sir.

How did Silencer get Rancho's address? Good point! Hey Chatur, come here How dare you open this? I got this from San Francisco Handmade biscuits Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that? Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'. Phunsukh Wangdu Do you know who that is? He's a great scientist 400 patents. The world wants him Took me a year to get an appointment Once he signs the deal with my company, I'll be huge! Forget Wangdu. How'd you get Rancho's address? You should be thanking Phunsukh Wangdu He led me to Rancho, See this My secretary was here to fix an appointment with Wangdu She didn't get the appointment. But I found Rancho I checked the Shimla directory and found Rancho's name What happened to his face? Plastic surgery in honor of your visit? Only one man has the answer Sorry Papa, I couldn't fulfill your last wish You kept asking me to take you on pilgrimage But I waited for the highway tender There the tender opened, here you closed your eyes I am so sorry, Papa. I could not be a good son... Wrong You're an engineer. Your degree's on the wall! You were a very good son How dare you barge in? I'll have you arrested No, you'll be arrested. We've made enquiries You use the degree to clinch contracts It's our friend's degree. How did you get it? This is a 150 acre estate If I shoot and bury you, no one would even notice Get the point? Now get lost I'm taking Papa's ashes to the sacred river. Can take yours too Grab Papa! Here, here Let go of Papa; Tell the truth or Papa is flushed; Hand over Papa - Papa goes to the sacred sewer Get Papa out of the potty - You pull trigger, I pull flush. I'll count to three Wanna shoot us? Raju, scatter the ashes One Take us down, and Papa's down the drain Two Then grope for him in the gutter What is it, Raju? We've got the wrong urn. It's empty; Empty? Empty: we'll empty it out; No, no; We'll empty it out No... hands up! Who are you? I am Rancho I swear on Papa, it's true I am Rancho; That was Chhote. Chhote? He was our gardener's son, Chhote He stayed on with us after he was orphaned Did odd jobs around the house, ran errands He had a passion for learning He'd wear my old uniform and slip into school And attend any class he liked. It suited me I made him do my homework, take my exams It was going well, till one day... Our teacher saw a sixth grader doing tenth grade math Which grade are you in, son? What's your name? We got caught Papa was a powerful man, so... our teacher alerted him before going to the Principal You started it, you will finish it People pretend to show me respect But behind my back... mock me as an illiterate I won't let that happen to my son This boy wants to study. I want just a degree Let the game go on Make this kid an engineer and I'll have a degree in my son's name on that wall I went to London for four years, he went to college as me He'd promised to cut contact with all after getting the degree But he always said, 'Two idiots will come looking for me' He really misses you both I'll give you his address, go to him But please keep my secret What secret? You got the wrong urn, sir. Papa is in here What the hell's going on? Who was that gun guy? Complicated story. Without subtitles. Not for you Ignore it - Where're we going? Ladakh Ladakh! Why? To meet Rancho What's he doing in Ladakh? No clue. We have the address of a school School teacher! I'm Vice President of Rockledge Corporation, and he... A for Apple, B for Ball... D for Donkey Next week I sign a huge deal with Phunsukh Wangdu And he... A for Apple, B for Ball... Today my respect for that idiot shot up Most of us went to college just for a degree No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife... no credit card, no social status None of this mattered to him He was in college for the joy of learning He never cared if he was first or last Who was the first man on the Moon? Neil Armstrong, sir Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong. We all know it Who was the second? Don't waste your time. It's not important Nobody remembers the man who ever came second Soon, 26 companies will be here with job offers You'll have a job even before your final exam This is your last lap, my friends Put the pedal to the metal. Step on the gas Go out there and make history! Any questions? Yes? Sir, suppose a student gets a job... but narrowly fails the final exam, will he still have the job? Very good question Anyone else with the same question? As expected Please come on stage. Give them a big hand For the last four years they've been our most consistent students Consistently last in every exam Come my geniuses, come Their brains will fetch a handsome price 'Cause they're completely unused And to answer their question - The exam won't affect their jobs Because no company will hire them anyway!

Because I love machines Engineering is my passion Know your passion? That's my bag - Be quiet What're you up to? This... is your passion Go post this letter What letter? 5 years ago he wrote this for his favorite wildlife photographer Andre... - Istvan He wanted to train with him in Hungary But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer, never posted it Quit Engineering, marry Photography Follow your talent If Michael Jackson's dad forced him to be a boxer... and Mohammad Ali's dad pushed him to be a singer... imagine the disaster Do you get it? Idiot; Loves Photography, but is marrying machines Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas Engineering is my wife and mistress both But I still fail. Why? - Explain 'Cause you're a coward, scared of the future Look at this - more holy rings than fingers One ring per fear - exam, sis's dowry, job With such fear of tomorrow, how'll you live today? How'll you focus on studies? Strange buddies; One lives in fear, the other in pretense You live in both: fear and pretense You're scared to tell Pia you love her... so you pretend you don't What rubbish! Easy to offer free advice, tough to follow it Have the guts? Go confess to Pia. There's no connection! - Deep connection, Your Holiness Listen, if you confess to Pia I'll tell Dad: No Engineering, I'm marrying Photography And I'll dump my rings before the job interview Deal?

Because the noses collide, and I wake up The noses never collide, stupid! I'm sorry, I thought you were Pia I wish I was Sis, why did you interrupt? It took him four years to say this Pia, kiss him. Show that noses don't collide You have my permission, kiss him... He's so cute! Who's this? - My sister Who're you? When you were talking, he kicked. First time; He? How do you know it's a 'he' or 'she'? Papa asked the astrologer If we'd get an engineer or a doctor Meaning? Boy becomes an engineer, girl a doctor Champ, better stay inside. Out here's a circus Your grandpa is the ringmaster. He'll crack his whip - 'Run! Life is a race. Be an engineer' But you follow your heart. If grandpa scares you... put your hand on your heart and say, 'All is well' He kicked Say it again All is well Kicked again Once more - All is well All is well Who is it?

Our son's getting his first job today Don't be stingy at such a proud moment Farhan? Don't you have the job interview today? I didn't go I don't want to be an engineer, Dad What happened? You had an accident? See that building? I jumped from its third floor Why? Because I was rusticated from college Why? Drunk, I urinated on the Director's door That scoundrel Rancho is messing with your mind! I don't enjoy Engineering. I'd make a terrible engineer Rancho has a simple belief - Make your passion your profession Then work will become play What'll you earn in that jungle? A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot Five years from now... when you see your friends buying cars and homes, you'll curse yourself Life as an engineer will bring only frustration. Then I'll curse you I'd rather curse myself, Dad The world will laugh! Label you a loser, for quitting in the final year Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate to be at ICE. What'll he think? Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me with an air-conditioner It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept in discomfort while I slept well He didn't take me around the zoo on his shoulders You did all that, Dad How you feel, matters to me. Mr. Kapoor makes no difference I don't even know his first name You think you're the hero of a melodrama? Enough, please... he's upset God forbid, if he did something crazy like Raju... Then the discussion is over Don't say a word or His Lordship will jump off the roof No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide. I promise The Rancho you detest put this picture in my wallet Told me to see it if a suicidal thought crossed my mind and imagine what'd happen to your smiles when you see my dead body I want to convince you, Dad but not with a suicide threat Dad, what'll happen if I become a photographer? I'll earn less I'll have a smaller house, a smaller car But I'll be happy I will be really happy Whatever I do for you will be out of genuine love I've always listened to you For once, let me listen to my heart Please... Dad Dad... Please don't go away... Return this Son, what's the cost of a professional camera? Can the laptop be exchanged for it? If you need more money, just ask Go live your life, my son Your grades are consistently poor. Reason? Fear I was a good student since childhood Parents hoped I'd end their poverty That scared me Here I saw the mad race. You don't count if you're not first My fear grew Fear is not good for grades, sir I slipped on more charms and rings Prayed to God for favors. No... begged for favors 16 broken bones gave me two months to think and reflect Finally, sense dawned Today I didn't beg God for this job, just thanked him for this life If you reject me, no regrets I'll still do something worthwhile with my life Such frank behavior is not good for our firm We need someone diplomatic to handle clients You're too straightforward But... if you assure us you'll control this attitude we may consider you It took two broken legs to get me up on my feet Wasn't easy to get this attitude Can't change it, sir You keep your job... I'll keep my attitude I'm sorry, no offense, sir Wait I've interviewed countless candidates for 25 years Everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job Where did you spring from, son? Sir? Shall we discuss the salary? Thank you, sir Your Majesty, thou art great Accept this humble offering Govind! You had said, 'If he gets a job, shave it off' What have you done? I feel naked without my moustache I've lost my dignity I won't accept defeat, Rastogi The job isn't yours until you pass your final exam And this time, I will set the question paper Dad, that's not fair Everything is fair in Love and War And this is World War... III Rastogi, you're dead meat; Hey What're you doing here? Be careful You've been drinking - Yup, had to down a couple A couple too many; Needed the guts - For what? For stealing this - What's this? The duplicate key to Virus's office The question paper's in a cover with a red seal Dad has set it, to fail Raju Go get it; Are you mad or what - that's cheating; Everything's fair in Love and War Tell me something... Do you really feel... the noses collide while kissing? Wait. Have some dhokla You Gujaratis are so cute But why does your food sound so dangerous? Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa, Thepla, Khakhra Sound like missiles C'mon 'Today Bush dropped two Dhoklas on Iraq' '400 dead, 200 injured' C'mon Oh... I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda. But your name... 'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad': Yuck I won't change my last name after marriage Pia, we can't get married Why? Is there someone else? No Are you gay? - No Then why don't you propose to me?

She's getting married today - in Manali Too late! She's married Not yet. It's a six hour drive If we rush, we'll reach before the vows What do you say? It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back No turning back Straight to Ladakh. We'll meet Rancho and return I have a Friday meeting with Phunsukh Wangdu Get into the car If I miss my meeting, the Japanese will get him They're offering him a first name in the company 'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi', profit sharing...

Amore... Quick, iron my coat Amore... Amore... We found Rancho! Now you can't marry this ass You're mad, Farhan Don't fool yourself, Pia. You still love Rancho You're still eating his favorite food Amore... Amore... He's incorrigible. Once a price tag, always a price tag Shut up, Farhan. Suhas is a changed man He doesn't speak of brands and prices anymore My 150,000/: coat Why do you people eat sauce? I'll sort it out, sir - How? Our laundry specializes in cleaning mint-stained suits I'll clean it in a jiffy Get it soon But it's too late now, Farhan - Pia Let's go, Pia, we're late Pia, it's me... Raju.

People will laugh at me So you'll commit suicide? Rastogi; People will gossip briefly, then forget But you... you'll regret on your deathbed that the car was at the gate, Rancho within reach... but in fear of people, you married this ass Housekeeping? Pia, minor problem What? We don't know if Rancho's married What; He won't be married - And if he is? Then we'll drop you back Relax! Handmade biscuit? What's he doing here? Ignore him - The biscuit's very good Till yesterday, I was a law-abiding citizen But in the last 24 hours, I'd grounded an aircraft almost assigned Shamaldas's ashes to the sewers, and made a bride elope from her own wedding! All for Rancho But he too would do anything for friends Like stealing the question paper... from the lion's den Envelope with the red seal He feared that if Raju failed, there'd be another high jump We were principled thieves, stealing the paper only for Raju We'd sworn we won't even take a peek Where's it hidden... We'll grow old searching; Ask Pia Pia, your phone Mr. Papa-To-Be; If you say 'All is well', he kicks He kicked Pia, your phone Found it! Rancho Hello? Quick, photocopy this Where was it? Put it back We're safe! - Where were you? Here - What's this? A gift Question paper. Virus set it himself, to fail you Strange buddies; First teach you to be upright, then offer a path to shame No way If I pass, it'll be on my own steam If I don't, it's still ok He'd won us over! I felt like embracing him as family... but then I controlled my emotions Damn thief - Sir, please, sir Rascal - Sorry sir Wanted to change the system You'll pee on my door - Sir, what're you doing Sorry sir You are rusticated! If all of you aren't out by morning, I'll call the police I will call the police; Rascals; Rascals, all of you How did he get my office key? I gave him the key, Dad I wish I'd given this key to my brother... He'd be alive today Stop it, Pia You think your son fell off a train and died? Shut up, Pia You decided he'd be an engineer Did you ever ask him what he wanted to be? You put such pressure on him... that he chose death over the entrance exam I don't understand... Dad, you go to your room Pia, don't do this He wanted to study Literature, be a writer But all he wrote was this suicide note Put that away, please No more cover-ups! Just once... if you'd said: Don't do Engineering if you don't want to just do what your heart is in then he'd be alive today He didn't commit suicide You're right, Dad It wasn't suicide... It was murder Many city roads are completely submerged Traffic has come to a standstill Dad... Mona? Go back, Millimeter. Why're you following us? Why? Your pop owns the road? Please help, we are desperate here; You can't send an ambulance? Get it from another hospital The entire city's flooded, sir. We're helpless Mona, you ok? Rancho, Pia Rancho, you can't reach here. Do as I say The water bag has burst Disconnected! Mona Mona! Turn on the lights - Where to? To the table tennis table - Pia, we're in the common room Raju, turn on the web camera Where's Mona?
