The Pained One Look at this. A treasure that will be lost to the ravages of time... unless we protect it with our devotion and your talents. I fear my talents may fail me in this. - Might someone else be more qualified? - You are being modest. There are in this very convent countless examples of your masterful skill. More than ever, Your Reverence, I hope you are right. If not for his mother, Jesus would have denied his divine call as well. Close up, Perico. And leave the key in the cottage. You can rest easy, Your Reverence. I get it--you're a cuckoo. But I don't have time for you. - I have something to tell you. - Well then, spit it out. It's embarrassing. What? - Now I really have to see the Prior. - I knew I shouldn't have told you. - Don't cause a scene. - Of course not. Don't get all worked up. It's not that. I just have to go and attend to my duties. Be assured, Your Reverence, that I will not leave until my work here is finished. I place all my hope in you and plead to God for the success of your work. - Prior. - May God watch over you. Come closer, Perico. Watch it. Don't take advantage of my generosity. Don't you like it? Of course. More than smoked bacon. It's just that... My God! The key! Did someone ask for coffee? No one. But I thought you could use some. Not now. I'm busy. Can't you see that I'm drawing? Yes, and on an empty stomach. Just have one drink. Without nourishment your skin will stick right to your bones. - Just leave me be. - I won't. And to think I almost didn't leave the house today. Help me, Don Serafín. Help me convince this rebel that one must eat in order to stay alive. Well, naturally. - You really ought to listen to her. - I'm done with this. Please, none of that. Catalina may be frank but she has your best interests at heart. This one would stay cooped up in his room all day if he had the choice. You need to live more in the moment. Get ready. We're taking you to a party with eligible women and we'll raffle you off. I'm so pleased to meet an artist that's so young and so talented. - Don Serafín exaggerates. - I don't think so. She said it, not me. Did I exaggerate how adorable she was? - Surely not. - Oh, you're all too much. - Will you be in the drawing? - I'm not much for party games... - ...but if you insist. - Insist? I demand it! And now I know whose name I hope to draw. When do you think your daughter will marry? That's difficult. - Some day soon? - I don't mean to hurry her but even with many years left, I fear I could miss out on the best ones. - What's stopping you now? - No, Don Serafín. - Just look at you. - Please. - Is Dolores seeing anyone? - Not that I know. Though she doesn't look it, she's very discriminating. I'm sure when she chooses a man he'll be the one. Sure... - Have you ever played "Wild Chance"? - I've never heard of it. - It's a very old game. - And easy. Very easy. Some slips of paper say a name. Others say what you're dared to do. You draw one from each and whatever you take...you have to take. - Understand? - Not a word. - I said I'm not much for games. - You'll get it! You write a name. You another. And you write the dare. Good. Are they all here? Who's going to draw? You. What luck! - Sweet nothings. - What? With me? Who loves you like me, little cupcake? Such an adorable little head. Oh, my cute little painter. Time to present ourselves as a couple. You have your mind made up. I can already see us heading to the chapel. Here, have a seat. Now pose for the portrait. This is unnatural. - I can't do it. - But it's just for pretend. Oh, well in that case... But I think... What? I think that Rafael could spread the word better than a mailed announcement. But do you think he'll even want to be at our wedding? Yes, I'm sure he'll come. He lives for these sorts of things. Hey now. - Don't get fresh. - But darling... In that case, we'll have to write Rafael. Yes, yes. Fine. And when it's time for the portrait, I'll put my arm like so... And then my head like this. - No, like this. - And I'll do this. The artist will call us the model couple. "Hold it, hold it. Don't move." - Too late. - We have angered God. Had your fun? - Father, don't be a brute. - I'm only getting started. I'm on to you. - We were just here...getting a drink. - From that crock? It's not what you think. What's going on here? Uncle Bienvenido, he's going to crush me. Yes, sir. He speaks of marrying Nicasia in this very room! You! You. - You are my son? - Yes, sir. So says my mother. Enough. I open my arms to you in kindness and this is how you repay me? I'll take the blame when it's deserved but you don't even let me defend myself! Why I... Don't. Let go. The truth is... Perico and I are in love. It's true. I love her. And we were planning the wedding, even the portrait. Yes, we've got it all figured out. No more, no less. And no less, no more. The portrait, José. Even the portrait. - You've always wanted a portrait. - That's true. We'll talk about this later. Fine then. Enough for now. It's already purged from my memory. - It's for the best. - Yes, sir. Go on now. Wait. Now that I know of your plans... - Before I can give you my blessing... - You tell him. - I need to know that you're not joking. - No, sir. Good. - And don't forget it. - I won't. - Go to your room. - To your room, my dear. That's how it's done. - I can tell you want to ask me something. - Me? No, wait. Let me guess. It's something you don't dare to ask. I wouldn't be a woman if I hadn't noticed. Tell me this instant or we're finished. You're right. - But it would pain me so... - Oh, don't worry. I don't want to cause you any pain. Let's go over there and relax. Forget about your art. Here by your side, I wouldn't change places with the happiest man alive. Careful what you say. That's akin to a declaration of love. Dear Rafael. No. Most esteemed... ...Don Rafael. It would give us great pleasure to enjoy your presence at our home... for Nicasia and I's marriage. You'll see when I put on My earrings and my necklace And my gloves so elegant And my mantilla with the silk bobbles All the single boys will envy you Because you love a girl Nobody in Zaragoza could compare with You'll get a good deal If you set up with me I'll also whet the appetite With my smart clothes And my cigar of medium size And here, in my ear, a pretty flower All the single girls will be jealous of you Because you've bagged a landowner With more horse sense than has ever been known here The deal is really smart More for you than for me F: I know how to move as you can see M: This woman really gets me going Nicasia, Nicasia, Nicasia I don't know how you do Those gymnastics That make me so giddy for you Perico, Perico, Perico If you're seasick Get off to the doctor but don't infect me I'm so tilted I've lost my compass The doctors Would give you nothing better The pleasure is opened up to me Thinking about the honeymoon - Good night, Mother. - See you tomorrow. Oh, Dolores. I love you. Natalio. - I hear someone. - I'm sure it's just your neighbors. I'm afraid, Natalio. I'm afraid. It's all right. There's nothing to fear. Listen. Now do you hear it? Who is it? - What are you doing here at this hour? - I could ask you the same. Quiet. Please, quiet. My mother can hear. I accept your wishes, even though they don't appear sensible to me. The will of the Lord can also be difficult to understand. This is my only refuge, together with Your Reverence and the brethren. My son, God's house is open to everyone. May the success of your endeavors match the firmness of your conviction. May you find here the peace that your soul requires. I'm here. - Do you have a minute? - Go on. The painter Don Rafael, I saw him at the convent. Like always, he's there to paint. No, he's studying to be a monk. - Could it be because of a woman? - Naw, I doubt it. He doesn't have it in him. Me on the other hand... At times the urge is so strong I can barely contain myself. - Is that so? - Yes, but I manage. What a waste of time. By the smirk on your face, I suppose you must waste a lot of it. - You pray and wait for him to come. - What? So he can marry you? - Get out of here. - To be away from me? - I need to break something. - What's going on here? Nothing, besides your son becoming a monk. No, Mother, nothing. It's the painter Don Rafael, giving his life away at the convent. I saw with my own eyes. All offerings be to God. The day is finished. Do you feel you can handle the strict regime of an ascetic life? This is my hope. Faith in the mercy of God and in the Prior's prayers. By the power of God and the Order, vested in me and in my brothers here I admit you among us, and grant you access to all the powers that you may require to prosper in your stead. We dismiss you now with God's blessing that all your ways will honor Him. What's with you? What's wrong, my daughter? Nothing. Leave me be. You've changed. You were once so full of life. Why don't you want your friends to come? I don't know, Mother. I don't know. Not today either, lady. Dolores, my daughter, what is it? - Darling... - It's nothing. It's... Darling, tell me again how you love me so. Tell me straight. Do you truly love me? - Will you love me always? - Always. I love no one else but you. I love no one else but him. Him alone. My poor girl. You'll see how soon you are able to move on. No, I couldn't. It's not possible. You love him that much? He's the only man I have ever loved. Don't fret, little one. At your age, such injustices are fleeting. Mother, you couldn't understand. If you suffered like I do, you would never forget it. I need him back here. What are you saying? Leave me be. Pay me no mind. You know I can't do that. I can't ignore what's behind your words. What you want to hide but are unable. I do understand. It's the truth. Mother, I've lost my soul. Forgive me. Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not listening. Answer me. - You haven't forgotten anything? - It's all in order. - And my coat? - It's there. I can leave then. She'll be coming soon and I don't need to be here to see it. Be well then. Have a good trip. Thank you. - I'll just carry your bags over. - Good, thanks. What do you want here? Why have you come? To find you, even though you don't want me to. But... To remind you of something you seem to have forgotten. - It's just that right now, I... - You, right now, are all I have left. I understand. You see then? She died? Yes. Because of you. I haven't come so that you might pity me, but for... your son. Give me just one moment. I'll be right back. I'll be right down. Keep the car waiting. It was good that you came to find me. I couldn't abandon you, especially not now. - I've always loved you Dolores. - I told you, that's not why I'm here. - Of course. I understand. Poor thing. - Let go of me. Calm down. Rest a while. My home is open to you. I just have one quick thing to do, and I'll be right back with you. The cold rock of Calvary is hidden Behind a black cloud up a solitary path The Virgin Mother walks on And her dear face like a lily flower Has lost its color And in her wounded breast Are nailed the thorns of sorrow Her shaking body bends Under the weight of her grief But she continues, walks on As her ice-cold lips kiss the ground Where a flower blossoms At every drop of blood that falls From Jesus the Redeemer Dark pilgrim's emblems Of pain turned to light She walks on, walks on quickly Because the Son is waiting for her Dying on the cross Woman and mother! Of all the world Most sacred With my apologies, Prior, I should say, the views of this novice can only lead to mass confusion. Father Lucas, even unfortunate outcomes can serve to increase God's glory. Surely, the man suffers a great pain that we cannot understand. Above all, it serves nothing to worry about a problem that isn't a problem. Here, put this in. It's too quiet. It would be nice to have a mule right now or at least better shoes. Don't complain. Just brace the cart and watch your step. - Go find one. - Who, me? Yes. - You do it, genius. - I... I have to do everything. Hello! Come out wherever you are! Stupid bunch of... ...enough of this. Hello! I take it you could use a mule. - You have mules then? - Obviously. Or should I wait for some others to come around? Come along then. Thank you, ma'am. I tell you, working your whole life with a clown is no way to live. I have no feet to walk in the flowers The only thing that moves me is my heart - Get to work! - I already am. I'm looking at this thing. That's work too. Oh, I'm sure that it is. You have so much work to do. No wonder you have no time to do mine. Mother is needed in the kitchen Come down the chimney, Mother She... I wonder how that new monk is faring, all the freedoms he once knew vanished. Ah, he's used to it by now. One gets used to everything in life. Is that everything? Of course, have a seat. Stay a while. Stretch out your legs. You don't need to talk down to me, buster. Yeah, yeah. Are you getting on or what? It's a wonder you're able to make a living at this. I'll be surprised if we even make it halfway. What can I say? Business is business. Because of you, now we'll get to the market late. We will? Let's get a move on then. Giddy up! Come on! That way. Come on, get the lead out. That way! And you two, more work, less horseplay! That way! At the country party, they can get married there. - The boy already knows what it will take. - Right. Entertainment... decorations... The dowry... Halt, halt. What's this about a dowry? Trust me. It's worth every penny. It's a dated tradition. - Anyone says different needs a pounding. - Now, now. - You're just trying to exploit me. - Excuse me? Maybe one day I'll find you a real woman and you'll see. And my boy is worthless? When it's time to work, he's always the first. The first to sit down. Look, if these are your concerns, we'll call the whole thing off. What? - I'd be no worse off. - Oh, really? We'll see. Halt, mules! Stay! Now we'll see if you have the nerve. What are you doing? I'm leaving with mine. You can keep yours. Do you get it now? You're just going to leave me here with one lousy mule? It's just one mule, but it's got four legs. More value. Good bye. Wait! Just a small dowry then? And two churns of wine. Or we call off the wedding. Fine, get back here. He's so confident, so strong, so proper. We could all learn from the young Brother Rafael. His soul is as strong as his hand with a brush. He sounds too good to be true. The Lord sends many good winds our way, but many of them turn bad. It's not like that, Father Lucas. Come on! Don't give up now! Wait! Halt! Is that a person? - How'd they get down there? - Surely not on purpose. Beats me. Let's find out. Oh my, it's a woman! - She doesn't look thrilled. - There's a child! Get it. Bring it up here. Poor innocent child. What could have happened? - She isn't from around here. - Beats me. Hey, we should take the kid back home and have the maid look after it. Good idea. - And Nicasia can help as well. - Yes, good. Hey, genius. Get down here and help me carry her. José, I'm holding the baby. It's been traumatized. - Of course, you're at your limit. - What does that mean? - I'll explain on the way home. - Giddy up! You say God can help me? What does he care about someone so insignificant? That's the same Virgin that came down from the heavens. Hurry, hurry, Perico! It's an emergency! - It's your father. - Is he all right? No, not him. He found a woman by the side of the road. Poor girl. God knows what could have brought her to this. You should have seen her there under the bridge. I shouldn't want to. - I'm here. - Like this child from heaven. Take him. You're just in time, Brother Rafael. We don't know what to do to bring her back. My son... - My son... - Don't worry, dear. He's in good hands. - My son... - You, look after the boy. She needs her rest. I'll stay here and watch over her. You two as well. It's best if you wait outside. - Did you two notice? - Notice what? - That isn't just any woman. - Who is she? - No less than the Virgin Mary. - Don't be stupid. The Virgin that Brother Rafael has painted on the convent wall. They're identical. My God. Why are you still unhappy? Haven't I given you some hope? None at all. I couldn't convince him. Then... such a long way... so treacherous... - so cruel... - Father. It seems such a great punishment for my error. Ma'am, your son has finally woken up. Should I bring him? I feel much better. I'll come up. Wait, Dolores. Wait. My son is calling. It's my only joy. Poor Dolores. Sleep, my treasure while I am by you And you'll lack neither Kisses nor warmth Sleeps in my lap Little ray of moonlight Sleep in this cradle of my love Your mother guards you, my little star Who is my joy and my sadness Ea, ea Take pity, Lord, on this wretched woman Once, with my love She could have been happy But what's the point of dreaming Of a love that cannot be? My heart, your hope can never be reborn Poor Rafael! You still suffer for me Without thinking that My madness brought you to this Be silent, heart Since happy you cannot be My heart, your hope can never be reborn Dolores, do not blame yourself Your pain fills me with repentance My pain does not concern you Let's consider only your plight I am a mother and I am strong And I know how to fight Why not take your troubles to the man Who lately wanted you so much And if necessary, ask his pardon Never! Never! Damn the coward that stained my honor And denies it and lies When his crime is pointed out to him! Damn him! Damn him! I'd sooner beg Without honor or good name Than be wed to a man of that sort Damn the vermin that cruel and mean Denies protection, love, and bread To that little angel Poor Dolores! Poor woman! I do not know what to do to stop your tears I have no hope of seeing you return to me Enough dreaming That love cannot be - Good bye, Rafael - Good bye My heart, never more can you be reborn - Ready for a rest? - I could use some water. It's like magic. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just choked a little. Listen. - I'm thinking of something. - What? I feel sorry for that poor girl. Perhaps your mother can do something for her. I'm a man, and still it makes me cry. Or we could help her. We could watch the boy, see how we like it. Fine, but... - Don't worry yourself. We'd be good at it. - I believe you. - But what about when we have our own? - Our own? It could happen. It does take two, you know. Fine, do what you want. - I'm happy as a pig either way. - Mmm, you're better than rice with milk. My father. All right, that's enough. Stop, I said! Make a turn over there and come here. Where are you going? I have to gather some things back in town. Remind everyone there to prepare for the celebration tonight. Yes, Father. Is here good? I think so. Keep moving. Keep moving until your legs give out. Do as I say. The big night has now arrived For all the farming boys Today in the plains They bring in the big crawlers They need enough roses and good herbs To fill the balcony of The brown-haired girl with the pained heart The big night has now arrived For all the farming boys Today in the plains They bring in the big crawlers They need enough roses and good herbs To fill the balcony of The brown-haired girl who pains my heart Love Love is a poison with the power to kill A liquor A liquor with the smell of an evil flower Its power Its power disturbs all who drink it So curse and fear that love Little flower of the orchard Don't close your window today Little flower of the orchard Listen, awake, to the best song The song of your night watcher And keep your window open So that love can enter Tender cherry I don't want a carnation I want your little kisses That taste like honey My God. Have mercy on me. Brother Rafael, what are you doing here? Prior. Why aren't you out with the others? I must confess. The woman that was my life Has been brought here by cruel fate And looking upon the poor thing A dormant urge awakens in me In her arms she carries a child Without even a home or a name This injustice simply cannot be Faith, that sinner, if it is pure Over passion it places duty And seeing her punishment Floods my being with pain and torture Love The love in my soul is a rose of goodness Its heat Its heat keeps bright The flame of righteousness in me There are two souls pleading Two beings crying And their pain Gives birth again to the love in me Love Love It's serious. Very serious. To test my faith, God has placed in my path a woman it seems was made just for me. Despised. Sad. - Alone. - Alone, no. God abandons none of his creations. Sullied by a man unwilling to fill his duties as a father. - God cannot abide this injustice! - Now, calm down. I am filled with charity for this woman and for this child. To stay here, my condemnation would be certain. If I leave, perhaps I may find my calling without sacrificing my devotion to God. I always suspected you were not meant for the pious life. The initiation was a test that you were not able to pass. Follow the dictates of your conscience. In the world, as here, you will have my blessing. Thank you, Prior. Return to your quarters and sleep if you can. Tomorrow these doors, which have offered you refuge from despair, will open for you. As we have all seen The fated lovers Yes, the fated lovers Share a love for all time What's going on now? What is this? I'm so cockeyed I can barely even see. I may be a while. Take a seat. But I'm leaving now. Just give me a minute. Let's go. My, you look terrible. Woman, if I had any strength left... I'd give you the boot faster than... You're not coming, ma'am? And try as the world might It cannot break apart their love But theirs is not The only love there is to be You have nowhere else to go? Subs by swo17 @ KG
