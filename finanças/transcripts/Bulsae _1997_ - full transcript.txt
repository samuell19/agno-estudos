Macau October 1995 Come to Seoul with me. Aren't you sick of this place by now? We can go back to Icheon. The priest is still there. Don't you miss him? Hey! You don't have to do anything. I'll provide for you! Hey, Pedro! Stop being a prick! Say that again and I'll kill you. I never asked you to come. If you want to leave, then go! That was dangerous. What's wrong with Pedro? It's not going to change anything. I'm going to the casino. Come by after you're done, okay? Do you know who he is? His father owns the Kyung Hee Group. I can't believe we ran into him. 3? Again? Producer Im Chung-ryul Executive Producers Yeo Han-gu & Choi Yong-bae Are you going to stop? I always save the last chip. It's a habit. Where should I bet? Where should I bet? One, two, zero. Your girlfriend is hot. Hello? What? {\a6}Lee Jung-jae I can't hear you. {\a6}Son Chang-min Okay, I'll be right there. {\a6}Oh Yun-soo Whatever I win, it's yours. Good night. Why don't you exchange the remaining chip for gold? It's zero! Yes! FIREBIRD Nice to meet you. Me? My name is Kim Young-hoo. My name is Kim Young-hoo. Are you up already? What time is it? Get up. Are you upset that I'm seeing him? - If you are, tell me. I can cancel. - Upset? I don't get upset. You're right. We have nothing to lose. Say hi. I'm Kim Young-hoo. Thanks to you, I got nicely drunk last night. Good to hear. Get in. So how about it? Care for a drink? Take the car for a spin. You wanted to drive something like this. Good idea. Are you sure you'll be okay? Do whatever you want. It has a turbo engine. Go easy when you start. Watch out. He seems like a charming guy. How do you know him? We grew up together in the church. There's nothing going on between us. Sounds convenient. What are you doing? It's good. Try it. Stop it! Don't worry. It'll make you feel good. Here. There was an accident! I think she's dead. It's cocaine. She only took a little bit. I don't know what happened. What should I do? - Wait here. I'll be back soon. - What are you going to do? Keep quiet. Don't just sit there. Help me. Are you sure this is okay? Do you think you can get away with crack and murder? Bring a rock, a big one. Seoul September 1996 We're 65% done, which is 15% less than anticipated. What about the stocks? We've secured 3%. Aren't you sick of this number game? Don't trust the numbers. We need results. Yes, of course. - Get the car ready. - Yes, sir. Can you hear me? How long has it been since you left Seoul? 3 years. What have you been up to? Hiding. Do I have to report everything? You must be tired. I got you a place to stay. Get some rest. This is one of my apartments. Make yourself at home. There should be food in the fridge. Let me know if you need a housekeeper. You can keep the car we came in. It's not bad. Come to the office when I call you tomorrow. As for today, get some rest, buddy. Are you looking for something? Can I help you with anything? No, thanks. Mr. Kim Young-hoo is here. Send him in. Sit down. You look good in those clothes. How do you feel? Guess what I just thought about? What can I do to make you disappear? - You want to escape the nightmare... - What do you want from me? You'll be disappointed. Why? I want to be your friend. Let me hang out with you. I'll do anything you say. That's it? That's it. Seocho-gu Bangbae 2-dong 1004-4 World Studio #1307 Lee Eun-young Hello? Young-hoo, I have a girl who is 2 months pregnant. She needs an abortion. I faxed her address. Make it happen, okay? Okay, got it. Who is it? Kang Min-sub sent me here. Min-sub? Put some clothes on. We're going to the hospital. What? The hospital? You know that the baby has to go, right? What are you talking about? Did Min-sub ask you to do this? What are you doing? What's the big idea? Put some clothes on. I told Mi-ran to come back to Korea. Is she coming? She will. I can't believe she listened to you. Maybe she'll bring 2 black guys this time. Don't make a fuss until the lawyer discloses our father's will. I don't get you. You won't have a problem with anything in that will? I can't let Mi-ran take over. How are things going with the Dongil stocks? We're at 48%. When's the expected date? I'm talking about the bankruptcy. It'll be a matter of days. I cut all the banks off. Can we depend on your friend in Dongil? Yes. He's the head of the investigative team. Once we merge, I'll have a job for you. Make sure nothing goes wrong. - I'll join you by 10. - Yes, sir. We'll need more lights for the Seoul snow, right? We'll have 200 more kilowatts. - Happy birthday! - Thank you. What? Why didn't you tell us that it's your birthday? It's not. Min-sub pretends every day is my birthday. You don't trust me, do you? Happy birthday! It's not my real birthday! This isn't a real celebration. I have a meeting at 10. I'll leave my car here. Do you have to go? Learn how to drive. This is an order. Wait here and drop her off at Yangjae-dong when she's done. You should get to know her. You'll see more of her. - Bye. - Bye. This is Kang Min-sub's car. I need to talk to the CEO of Dongil Construction. It's urgent. Just listen. How is the head of your investigative team doing? He's getting a paycheck from Kyunghee Investments. I saw it with my own eyes. Your backswing has improved. Keep your eyes on the ball. Stay away from friends like him. You can hire other chauffeurs. He has that look in his eyes, but you'll get used to it. I don't feel comfortable around him. Hey! Young-hoo! Wow, you didn't have to do that. Thanks. Thank you. The head of the investigative team in Dongil has been fired. They secured a loan to stop bankruptcy. We can't get any more stocks. I'm sorry. - I'm looking into what happened... - There's no need for that. You like fishing, right? Take a break and fish all day long. Sir! Get Song for me. Excuse me. I think my battery is dead. Can you help me? It's a new car. I was kidding. Can you at least tell me who you guys are? You're working for CEO Kang Min-sub of Kyunghee Investments, right? Let's keep this civil. I have some questions for you. I heard that Kang bankrupted a company. Bring the suitcase. Nothing in life is free. Why don't you try coaxing Kang Min-sub instead? Who is it? This is Song Woo-suk. I got him like you asked. All right. I'll be back soon. I don't think you need to worry about him. Young-hoo, let me see. Are you okay? It looks like the boys were mistaken. - Take him to Dr. Shin. - Yes, sir. This is nice. I want you by my side all the time, Hyun-joo. Don't even think about running away. Thanks for the gift. I need you at the airport tomorrow. Come to my office in the morning. - Min-sub Hey, do you know any clubs? - Excuse me? He wants you to wait at home. That's what he wants. Go to the nearest club. I'm taking you home. Whatever. Let me go. I said let me go! All right. I'll take you. Finally. Drink it. If you pass out, it's none of my business. Just drink it. Snap out of it! Are you sure you're a chauffeur? You've got balls. Go and bring my coat. You're late. Where were you? Hey pig, it must be tough pretending to be human. Say hi. Your brother Min-sub and Hyun-joo are... Did you get him with your looks? It won't last long. He's a player. Nice to meet you. Don't say that. You'll soon regret it. You're drunk. You need to rest. Where are you staying? I know that this isn't my home. Shit! Young-hoo! Take Mi-ran to her hotel. Good night. Hey, get me out of these clothes. These, too. Hey! Hey, Mi-ran! Call me anytime if you need me. Mi-ran said that? She called me in the morning. She called? Mi-ran? I received her call in the morning. This is a great opportunity. You'll learn a lot about life. Stick by her for one week. I'll have to try until I make it. Try? Good luck. One more thing. My assistant will give you two books and a map. Give them to Hyun-joo. She needs to learn how to drive. Teach her. The interpreter went to the hotel. Her name is Lee Ji-hye. Check her name. Bye. These are from Min-sub. Thank you. I'll get going then. Wait! You're cleaner than I thought. Here's the apartment key. I don't need it. I find it odd that you two are friends. You know what I mean by that, right? Do you need anything? Come in. - Take me to the mall. - What do you need? Don't you want to know why? No. The shoes are fine. Stop! Come on in. What are you looking for? Did they restock the whisky? Bring it to me. - Care to join me? - I don't drink during the day. Put the clothes in the closet. I don't want them to get wrinkled. Bring the whisky bottle. Let's begin. The Chairman has decided that 40% of the entire conglomerate will go to Mr. Kang Gyung-sub. The list of companies are on paper. Mr. Kang Min-sub and Miss Kang Mi-ran will each get 30%. Miss Mi-ran's inheritance includes the West Coast Resort building lot and the Kyunghee Mall. The old man has gone mad. Min-sub! The Chairman left a voice recording. In the event there is a problem, he wanted you to follow the civil law. The will has been notarized. As for exercising the right of ownership, we will follow the family's wishes. Why? Are you frustrated? The grass is always greener on the other side. Do you need more? Let me know. I don't care. - Who knows? I might give you some. - Stop it! Fine, I'll beat it. By the way, I want to thank you. Thanks for Young-hoo. He's a charming man. He's also competent. Bye. What were you doing here? You should've waited upstairs. This might be my last request. Make Mi-ran... go back to America. Don't ask me why. Me? There's no need to be modest. She's okay with whatever she likes. She'll listen to you. I'm off. Give it some thought. I'm sure there's a way. By the way, do you still have that gold chip? I still have it. I gave that to you. Whenever my mother cried, I walked on the bridge with my eyes closed. Why did you close your eyes? Because you wanted to die? Just because. Do you know how my mom died? She took a bunch of sleeping pills. She only did it to get attention, but it killed her. No one cared. Even her husband didn't come. Now I've turned into her. I can't sleep a single night without my pill. Kim Young-hoo. My dream? I want to leave this place. I'm going to Sydney for my 28th birthday. That's your dream? Aren't you going back to America? Why? Do you want me gone? I want to see a bigger world. Why don't we go together? Do you really mean that? We'll drive 200 km/hr on the highway and win the jackpot at Las Vegas. That little pig made you say that, didn't he? Tell him that I'm going to kill him. You'll never say something like that. You keep your thoughts to yourself. I can tell. That pig! I won't let him send me to America so she can have it this way. Finding Professor Yu from Korea at Cambridge isn't hard. I won't stop you from meeting him, but just introduce yourself. We can talk about the wedding later. Let me take care of everything. Why don't you learn how to drive? Get your licence and I'll buy you a sports car. I can ask Young-hoo to give you private lessons. Did you see that? I didn't hit anything! That was great. You're a fast learner. Can I take the test with automatic transmission? - What's the matter? - Nothing. Hello? It's me. Did you talk to Mi-ran? No, not yet. What are you doing right now? Teaching Hyun-joo how to drive. Can I talk to her? Uh... Hold on. No, forget it. Remember what I asked you. Talk to her before she goes to America. Remember, I want some good news. Hello? You're home! Where were you all day? I had things to do. Can you come out? No, I'm seeing a friend. Sorry I couldn't call. See you tomorrow. Good night. I think it went well. - These are from Kang Min-sub. - Thank you. Is everything good? Of course. You're here, too. It's a success. I like your smile. I'll get going. Don't be silly. Eat with us. Can you wait? - I don't belong here. - You're my partner. - Hello? - It's me. When did you get back? Where are you? It's really noisy. I'm having dinner with the team. How was driving practice? Where's Young-hoo? I don't know. We were done in the morning. I miss you. Can I join you? No, this isn't for you. Why not? Am I not allowed there? Get some rest. I'll call you later. What are you going to wish for? It's a secret. You should make a wish, too. - You threw this, right? - That's cheating. If you want it, just put it in. Are you okay? I was wrong about you. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Why do you live by yourself? I don't know. - I've always been alone. - Always? I heard that my mother died while giving birth to me. You're going to catch a cold. Why don't we get another drink? Where were you? I asked where were you? I had a few drinks. Yeah, there's that yucky smell. - Who did you drink with? - A friend. A friend? Are you coming at me? Tell me. Is Hyun-joo your friend? This was the plan from the beginning. Tell me. Was Mi-ran not enough for you? Tell me. First you get my woman, and then what? What do you want from me? Tell me! Snap out of it, you filthy whore. Get up. Bring it on! Now! Get up! It's over, you son of a bitch! You looked great dancing in there. Why didn't you come inside? Don't make lying a habit. I don't want to repeat myself. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. By the way, where's Young-hoo? Where's Kang Min-sub? Your CEO. - He's out. - Out? Where? He didn't say where. Excuse me, but who are you? Why? Are you going to tell me? Can you get up? Let's go to the hospital. - Go to the pharmacy. - No, you need to go to the hospital. I need an anti-inflammatory drug, some gauzes, bandages, a needle and a thread. Let's just keep this between us. Please? I'm sorry. I've became a burden. Don't say that. Don't worry about it. What happened? - Min-sub did this to you, didn't he? - No. - Get me a glass of water. - Water? I'll get going. Take care. What a surprise. I can't believe we're all in the same room. What did you do? You're not ready for guests yet, aren't you? It's time to say goodbye. You know that too, right? That's for me to decide. I don't like repeating myself. I'm warning you. Let's go. - Get in. - You almost killed him. Get in. He's a lonely man. Do you know that? I said, get in! Don't tell me what to do. They wouldn't give me your address, so I crashed the telephone company. There's been a big change in my life. Do you know what it is? You became rich. I was able to sleep fine without pills for 3 days. - Isn't that amazing? - Congratulations. Let's get married. Anything you wish for, I'll make it come true. Should I fill a coffin with Hangang water and bury it next to the Seokchon Lake? If I put a mulberry fence and plant peanuts, flowers will bloom every year. After that, I want to leave this place. I'm surprised. I didn't except you to bring Young-hoo. Let's sit. Funny, huh? I wasn't going to tell you that I'm getting married. This is great news. This really is great news. Young-hoo! You're moving on up. That's a funny way to put it. Let's eat. What's good here? Excuse me. I'll have what you're having. What did you do? You're marrying her? Let go. Shut up before I kill you. - Let me go. - Call off the wedding! Now! That's up to me to decide, not you. What did you just say? You son of a bitch! Twice is enough. I won't have any more of this! Give it a rest. My patience is running dry. And do you need this? You can have it back. I have a question. I heard that a married couple drowned in the Hangang River 25 years ago. Did that happen? I don't remember. Hi. Come and sit down. I can hear you fine from here. Tell us. We have all the information we can get from Korea. Here's the file, but to give you a summary, there were farmers in Yeongdong 25 years ago. They mostly grew mulberries and peanuts. One man was conned by land brokers and committed suicide in the Hangang River. His wife lost her mind and fell in the same river. When they rescued her, she gave birth to a boy as she was dying. That boy is Kim Young-hoo. He grew up in a church in Icheon until one day the church caught on fire and he disappeared. Since then his whereabouts have been unclear. 3 years ago he went to Australia. From there, he went to Macau. He came back to Korea 9 months ago. She knows how to pick'em. Nice work. You're not interested in writing fiction, are you? Excuse me? You just read a magazine piece and forgot about it. Yes, sir. I haven't even read it. What's been up with you lately? I barely get to see you anymore. You're avoiding me, aren't you? Tell me. Tell me! Am I imagining things? What are you doing? Min-sub! You're hiding something, aren't you? Did you sleep with him? Did you? Yes, I did. Many times. You don't have a right to talk about love. Hello? Hyun-joo? Uh-huh. Okay. Stay right there. I'm sorry. Something came up. It's torn. Look awful, doesn't it? It was Kang Min-sub, wasn't it? I'm so dumb. I should've worn something thicker. Thank you for coming. If he exercises violence again, I'll make him pay. Read it. He's with Hyun-joo right now. I got those two together. You can't marry him. I won't forgive them. You're my sister. Don't you forget that. We're family. Aren't you going to pray? I can't. My sin is too great. Pedro... Pedro is my baptismal name. I lived here until I was 16. I played hide-and-seek with God in this place. I wanted to hear my mom's voice more than God's word, so I would crawl under the bench. Don't do this. Let's set a date for our wedding. I'll let you decide everything. Do you really mean that? I feel bad because I can't pitch in for the wedding. Are things bad between you and Min-sub? I want his blessings. It's nothing. - I'll talk to him. - Will that fix anything? Of course. He'll give us his blessings. Did you wait long? Go ahead. She's inside. Did you wait long? I think I should give this back to you. I'll never forget you. Wait. I'm going to marry Mi-ran. I'm not sure if I belong with her, but I've made up my mind. Congratulations. Don't forget me too soon. I wish you happiness. You're coming with us. What's going on? What are you doing? Let me go! You're going to marry Mi-ran? Snap out of it, buddy. It's over. I have a question. You lost your wallet a year ago, didn't you? Guess where it is? Do you have it? It's under the waters of HacSa Beach in Macau. That's all I want to say. So that's a threat. Do you think you can get away with it then? I'm no strangers to prisons. One thing for sure is that it'll end you. I'll get going. Hey, guess where Hyun-joo is at right now? Remember the church you were with her in? She'll be waiting for you at the church you set fire in. That's tonight. What are you plotting? Mi-ran will be there, too. So how about it? You should go, huh? When he shows up, get him. He'll be there. Don't let him walk there. Yes, sir. Make him get down on his knees. The choice is yours. He's on his way to the church to see Hyun-joo. Even if I stop him, he won't listen. You should talk to him. Min-sub, I'm sorry if I've wronged you. It's over between us. Why are you doing this? I heard that you came to this church with Young-hoo a few days ago. It made me wonder... After showing up at the church he gave into temptation to burn down, what could he possibly have talked about with you? He has nothing to do with me. I'm leaving. Send her in. I'll go with you. You're going to the church, right? I can find that place with my eyes closed. Don't worry. You'll have to crawl there. Get him! I feel like I woke up from a nightmare. I want to forget everything. Don't you agree? Confess everything you've done and ask for forgiveness. Is that you, Mi-ran? Come inside. Stop! I'm walking there on my own two feet! Why did you come here? I'm sorry. What happened? Are you okay? It's time to say goodbye. Yes, it's time to say goodbye. Young-hoo! Young-hoo! Young-hoo! No! No! No... No... No... No... I need to find a warm room somewhere in this city and light a candle, but I can't find a sunny garden anywhere in this forest of buildings. [Kim Heung-shik]
