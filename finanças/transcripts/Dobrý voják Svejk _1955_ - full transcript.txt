Czechoslovakian State Film PUPPET FILM (PRAGUE) Presents a Puppet Colour Film The Fortunes of the Good Soldier Svejk A Work by National Artist JOSEF LADA Read by State Laureate Prizewinner J. WERICH Camera Editing Production Music Directed and Edited Jiri Trnka FROM HATVAN TO THE GALICIAN BORDER The station was overcrowded. It can certainly be said that here was a mass of trains with troops from every possible unit of the army. There was also a train with a detachment of aircraft. On other tracks stood wagons with the same objects, such as aircraft and guns, but badly broken. They were shot-down aircraft and howitzers with their barrels smashed. And so while everything fresh and new went up to the front,these the remnants of glory travelled back to the base for repair and reconstruction. To the soldiers who crowded round the smashed guns and aeroplanes Lieutenant Dub was just explaining that they were war booty. Whatever way you look at it or not, it's just war booty. At first sight it looks a bit tricky when you read "K und K Austrian Artillery Battalion" but it was probably like this: the gun fell into the hands of the Russians and we had to win it back. Booty like that is much more valuable because... because nothing must be left in the hands of the enemy. It's like what happened in Przemysl or with that soldier who had his field flask torn off by the enemy. I have something to return to you, Sir It was during the Napoleonic wars, and this soldier went into the enemy camp at night and brought the field flask back again. It was worth it, because in the night the enemy had drawn spirit rations. See you make yourself scarce, Svejk and that I don't find you here again! Just as you order, Sir. After Svejk had gone Lieutenant Dub was still so stupid that he drew the soldiers' attention again to a shot-down Austrian plane which had clearly marked on its metal frame 'Wiener Neustadt'. You don't know me yet! shouted Dub Perhaps you know my good side. But when you come to know my bad side, I'm evil! You think I'm evil, I'll make you all cry! This one we shot down from the Russians at Lvov, This one... we shot down from the Russians at Lvov, His words were overheard by Lieutenant Lukas, who came up and added aloud: And both Russian pilots were burned. He left without a word, thinking that Lieutenant Dub was a prize fool. Humbly report, Sir, Company Orderly Svejk awaits further orders. Humbly report, Sir, I've already looked for you in the staff carriage. Listen, Svejk, you know what your name is? Have you already forgotten what I called you? You're a... Humbly report, Sir, I've not forgotten a thing like that, because I'm not like a certain volunteer called Zelezny. Long before the war, when we were in Karlin barracks, there was a Colonel there by the name Fliedler von Bumerang Humbly report, Sir, Our Colonel was half your height, he had full whiskers like Prince Lobkovic so that he looked like a monkey, and when he got angry he jumped twice as high as he was tall, so we called him the India-rubber Fossil. It happened to be the first of May and we were on alert. The evening before in the courtyard he delivered a great speech saying that the next day we must all remain in the barracks, and not move a step outside, so that in case of need on highest orders, we could shoot all the Socialist scum. And so if any soldier had extended leave of absence today and, instead of returning to the barracks, stretched it out until the next day, he would be committing high treason, because a drunken bastard like that couldn't hit a man when salvoes were fired but would shoot into the air. So that simple volunteer Zelezny said that if the India-rubber Fossil wouldn't let anyone into the barracks next day, It would therefore be best for him not to come to the barracks at all and that's what the smart fellow did with great gusto! But this Colonel Fliedler, Sir was such a lousy swine, God help us, that next day he went all over Prague looking if anyone from our regiment had dared to leave the barracks. Somewhere near the Powder Tower he had the luck to run into Zelezny and immediately let fly at him: "I'll give you hell! I'll teach you! I'll make it bloody hot for you!" He said a great deal more like this and dragged him off to the barracks. And all the whole way he said all sorts of ugly threatening things and kept on asking him his name. "Zelezny, Zelezny, you'll shit for this "I'm delighted I've caught you. I'll teach you the first of May! "I've got you now, Zelezny, "I'll lock you up, lock you up!" But Zelezny didn't care any more. So, as they went along Poric, around Rozvafilu, Zelezny got away and cheated the India-rubber Fossil of the pleasure of clapping him in jail. The Colonel was so furious over his escape that in his rage he forgot the delinquent's name, got it mixed up, "Who is he? Really who?" and when he came back to the barracks, began to jump up to the ceiling. The ceiling was low and the duty officer was very surprised that the old Fossil was shouting: "Clap Medeny into jail! Don't clap Medeny into jail! "Clap Oloveny into jail! Don't clap Oloveny into jail! "Clap Cinovy into jail!" And so the old Fossil bullied his staff, asking if they had caught Medeny, Oloveny and Cinovy, and he even called up the whole regiment, but Zelezny, whom everybody knew about, had been drafted into the medical section because he was a dentist. Then one day a man from our regiment succeeded in stabbing, in the pub U Bucku, a dragoon who had been running after his girl. So they formed us into a square and we all had to come on parade, even the sick,and if anyone was very ill, he was held by two others. And so there was no help for it: Zelezny had to fall in in the yard and they read us the regimental roll-call. Our Colonel suddenly discovered Zelezny "You can't get away from me, you can't escape anywhere. "Now I say again that you're Zelezny "I keep saying Medeny, Cinovy, Oloveny, but he's Zelezny "You bloody bastard Zelezny, I'll teach you Oloveny, "Cinovy, Medeny, you bastard "you swine, you Zelezny!" And then he gave him 4 weeks' clink A fortnight later his teeth began to ache and he remembered that Zelezny was a dentist. So he had him brought out of arrest to pull his tooth out. And then, a day later, he wanted to lock him up again, but suddenly he became meek, Sir; and finally sent him kisses! And so that's what happens, Sir, when a superior officer forgets the name of his subordinate. But a subordinate must never forget the name of his superior, just as that Colonel used to tell us. He said we'd never ever forget that we had once had a Colonel Fliedler. Was that story perhaps a little too long, Sir? Listen, Svejk, do you know of any medicinal cognac? I'm not feeling very well. If you like, Sir, I'll find some cognac for you only I'm afraid that the train might leave before... In the end Lieutenant Lukas assured him that they would not be leaving for two hours and that cognac was being secretly sold in bottles just behind the station And here were fifteen crowns and he should go, but not tell anybody that it was for Lieutenant Lukas or that it was he who sent him, because it was a strictly forbidden thing. You can rest assured, Sir, that everything will be all right, because if there's anything I love, it's forbidden things. I've always been mixed up in something forbidden without my even knowing about it. Once in Karlin barracks they forbade us... About turn! quick march! Lieutenant Lukas interrupted him. What are you fooling around here for? Do you know me? Humbly report, I don't want to get to know your bad side. Humbly report, Sir, I want to know you only on your good side, so you don't have to make me cry as you said to me last time. Get away, you bastard! I'll have something to say to you later! Immediately behind the ditch bordering the road was a hut where all this business with illicit drinks was transacted. The soldiers first of all started the dealings at the baskets, and a Jew with sidecurls drew out of the bottom of the basket an innocent-looking bottle of spirits and took it under his kaftan to the wooden shed, where a soldier hid it discretely in his trousers or under his tunic. Svejk directed himself here while Lieutenant Dub with his detective talent watched him closely from the station Svejk went straight to the first basket. First he picked out some sweets which he paid for and put in his pocket, while the gentleman with sidecurls whispered to him: I have some schnapps too, Honourable soldier! Svejk went into the shed but did not hand over the money until the gentleman with the sidecurls had opened the bottle and let Svejk taste the contents. Svejk was satisfied with the cognac and returned to the station after shoving the bottle under his tunic. Where have you been, you bastard? Humbly report, Sir, I've been to buy some sweets. If the Lieutenant doesn't object... I've already tasted them and they're not bad. They've got a pleasant, special taste like plum jam, Sir. What are you carrying there, you bastard? Take it out! Attention! Humbly report, Sir, that I pumped a little drinking water into an empty cognac bottle. I still have a terrible thirst after that goulash we had yesterday. Only the water in that pump, as you can see, Sir, is a bit yellow. It must be iron-rich water, they are very healthy and good for you. If you have such a thirst, Svejk, If you have such a thirst, then drink, but drink properly. Drink it all in one draught! Lieutenant Dub had already planned in advance how Svejk would take a few gulps and be unable to go on, And how he, Lieutenant Dub, would have a glorious victory over him Ah, you wretch! Humbly report, Sir, that water really had a taste of iron. Taste, I'll give you taste! Come and show me the well where you got the water from! It's only a little way from here, Sir, just there behind that wooden shed. Walk in front, you scum, so I can see whether you can walk straight! Here is that iron-rich water, Sir. The panic-stricken man with sidecurls appeared and Svejk told him in German to bring a glass as the lieutenant wanted to drink. Lieutenant Dub completely lost his head and drank up the whole glass, and there spread through his mouth a flavour of horse urine and manure. Then, driven completely silly by what he had experienced, he gave the sidecurled Jew five crowns for the glass of water and turning to Svejk said: What are you gaping at? Clear off home! Humbly report, Sir, but in five, at the most ten, minutes I shall be completely out of it but I'll lie down in my compartment. I would beg you, Sir, if you would not call me, Sir, for the next three hours at least, and not give me any orders, Sir, until I've slept it off. Everything's completely in order, but Lieutenant Dub caught me. I told him that it was water so I had to drink the whole bottle of cognac in front of him to show him that it was just water. Everything is all right, I didn't give anything away, and I was also very careful. But now, humbly report, Sir, Sir, I'm already beginning to feel it Beg to report, Sir, I'm used to it Go away, you brute!

WERICH Music Direction and Editing Jiri Trnka SVEJK'S MISADVENTURES IN THE TRAIN In a second-class compartment of the Prague-Ceske Budejovice express there were three people: Lieutenant Lukas, a completely bald elderly gentleman seated opposite, and Svejk, who stood modestly at the corridor door, and was about to hear a new torrent of curses from Lieutenant Lukas, Svejk! Svejk, they've stolen one of our cases I dutifully report, I dutifully report, Sir," that they really did steal it. There are always a lot of crooks like that knocking about on the station and I imagine that one of them undoubtedly liked your suitcase, and this crook undoubtedly took advantage of the moment. when I went away from our luggage to tell you that everything was all right He probably stole our case just at that exact moment. They're sniffing after such an opportunity. At stations they always steal and will keep stealing. There's no other way. Svejk, I still don't know whether you're just playing the mule or whether you were born one? What did you want to say, Sir? The door was closed. What was in the suitcase? Nothing in particular, Sir, only the mirror from the room with the iron clothes-rack from the hall so we've haven't suffered any loss since the mirror and the clothes-rack both belonged to the landlord. I dutifully report, Sir, I had no idea beforehand that the suitcase would be stolen and as for the mirror and the clothes-rack I told the landlord that we would return them to him when we came home from the war. In hostile countries there are many mirrors and clothes-racks, so that even in this case we can't suffer any loss. As soon as we conquer a city... Be quiet, Svejk! I'll have you court-martialled! Think carefully, if you're not the bloodiest fool in the world! You've noticed that? I dutifully report that I've noticed it too. I have, as they say, a talent for observation when it's too late and something unpleasant is happening. I have the same luck as a certain Nechleba from Nekazanka, His grandfather went on a hike... Svejk! For God's sake, Svejk, leave me in peace with your stories! Dutifully report, Sir, Everything I tell you is holy truth. So his grandfather went on a hike... Svejk! Show your tickets, please Maybe this gentleman reading a newspaper also has a ticket Well, well, he had one Be quiet Svejk! I didn't say anything, please. Be quiet, Svejk! A million times! Now I'll be quiet, Lieutenant Dutifully report, a million times. In the end Lukas read, He read of great victories, read of the activities of the German submarine 'E ', he read of a new German invention for blowing up towns with the help of aeroplanes. He read and forgot his sufferings. Do you happen to be Mr Purknibek, the representative of Slavia Bank? Dutifully report, Sir, I once read in the newspapers that a normal man ought to have on his head an average of 60 to 70 thousand hairs and dark-haired people have fewer, as can be seen from many examples. And then also a medic in U Spirku cafe. once said that hair loss was caused by emotional excitement in the sixth week. Get out, you swine! The bald man took Lukas by surprise when he introduced myself. The bald man was not Mr Purknibek of Slavia Bank, but a Major General Major General von Schwarzburg. He was the most frightful Inspector-general ever born, and was travelling in civilian dress to take Budejovice by surprise. If he found something wrong, he spoke thus to the Commandant: "Have you got a revolver? "You have. Good! "In your place I would certainly know what to do with it, "because what I see here is not a garrison... "but a bloody pigsty!" And indeed after his inspections someone always shot himself somewhere or other The Major-General now gave a lecture on the fact that officers spoke with their subordinates in a familiar tone and that he saw that as the danger of democratic principles. The soldier must be in terror, he must tremble before his superior and fear him, Officers must not allow them to think independently or even think at all, that was the tragic mistake of recent years. In the past, the men feared their officers like fire, but today" And so on and so on. Turn! Quick March! Halt! Turn! Quick March! Halt! Right Turn! March! Svejk, the moment has finally come when you are going to get a couple of slaps such as the world has never seen! I dutifully report,Sir, I never thought that some bald person would be a Major General! - Svejk! damn you, shut up - I had no idea, I dare to report... - Be silent Svejk! - But I'm already silent! - Shut up, damn you! - It was, as they say, a tragic mistake. Svejk, and now I'll show you something! Tunnel, Lieutenant, Sir. Unfortunately, now we must be careful. Once a tailor told us when he was tailoring in Styria, how he went by train and thought that he was the only Czech in the whole train, Hey, another one! So, near St Moritz he began to slice up the ham, which he had bought in Maribor. This is a long one, Sir The gentleman sitting opposite him began to water at the mouth. Ah, we've come out. The tailor noticed it and said: "You'd like some, you old bastard!" And the gentleman replied in Czech: "Man, if you'd give it to me!" That gentleman's name was Vojtech Rous. Dutifully report, Sir, We'll be in Tabor in five minutes. And the train only stops for six and a half minutes. Will you order something to eat? Some years ago they used to have some very good... I wish you good success May I ask you something, please? A certain Hoffman, it's some years ago, used to come to me, and he always stated that these alarm signals never work, that they simply don't work well when you pull on this handle. To tell the truth, I've never been interested in such things, but since I've noticed the alarm system here, I'd like to know what I'm up against If by chance or necessity or sometime... I was wondering why the train stopped so suddenly. It was going and then suddenly, if you please, it stopped. It annoys me more than you. It will cost you twenty crowns. To this Svejk repeated that he was honest and had no interest in delaying the train because he was going further on. But it's worth twenty crowns, and it's really still cheap. Once, when His Imperial Majesty visited Zizkov, a certain Franta Snor stopped his carriage by kneeling before His Imperial Majesty in the road. I dutifully report, Lieutenant, that they're blaming me for stopping the train. Then the police commissioner told Mr Snor with tears in his eyes that he ought not to have done it in his district, but in a street lower down which belonged to Commissioner Kraus. He should have stopped the carriage there. After that they put Mr Snor in jail! So let's get going, shall we? It's not nice when the train is late. If it were peacetime, for God's sake but when there's a war, then everyone should know that there are military ranks travelling in every train; Major Generals, Lieutenants and batmen. How long have you been with the railways, Conductor? Conductor? I'll hand you over to the Stationmaster in Tabor. Good, I like talking to educated people and I look forward to seeing the Stationmaster in Tabor. Years ago, Mr Wagner was the head of the station in Svitava. He was a devil to his subordinates, teasing them wherever he could, and was most of all down on the points man Jungwirt, EXIT until the poor man drowned himself in despair in the river. Before he did that, he wrote a letter to the station master saying that he would come and haunt him in the night. Dear Mr Chief And I'm not lying. He did it. In the night our good man was sitting at his telegraph receiver the bells rang and he received the following telegram: "How are you, you old bastard? "How are you, you old bastard? "How are you? "you old bastard? Jungwirt." This lasted a whole week and the station master began sending official telegrams: "Forgive me, Jungwirt. "Forgive me, Jungwirt. "Forgive me, Jungwirt. "Forgive me, Jungwirt." And in the night the receiver tapped out the following reply: "Hang yourself on the signals at the bridge." "Jungwirt." And the station master obeyed. A while later they jailed the telegraphist from a station to Svitava. By this you see, there are things between heaven and earth of which we have no idea. Beer! Hot sausages! Hot sausages! Beers! Beers! They're taking me to the station master, Sir. Lieutenant Lukas did not answer. He was overcome by complete apathy to everything. Svejk then addressing the chief, declared that he was innocent Folks! I'm innocent! The crowd accepted this verdict and one gentleman announced that he would pay for Svejk and added: "Look at him. You see that he's innocent!" The good man who believed in Svejk's innocence took him to the third-class restaurant and gave him a fiver for a ticket to Budovice and beer, The train to Gorazdjovice is departing! Ihre Dokumenten! Your tokuments? I zee you here zitting, nicht travelling, zitting, trinking, keep on trinking, still trinking! Don't have them, darling, Lieutenant Lukas, of regiment No 91, took them with him and I stayed here at the station. Wot is this wort "Darlink"? "Darlink" - "Darlink", that's like Sergeant-Major Efrey soldat most haf tokumenten Vizout tokuments lock him op at Bahnhofs-Militarkommando, ze lousy brute; like mad dog! Yes! I'm innocent and should be in Budejovice I'm innocent! so it turned out to be a dark night outside Tabor. I am... I am... I went out for a little walk into the green grove... Benedict, Windischkrez Two gentleman soldiers Benedict, Windischkrez Two gentleman soldiers When they prayed... When they prayed... When they prayed... They started the war!

WERICH Music Direction and Editing Jiri Trnka SVEJK'S BUDEJOVICE ANABASIS Jesus Christ! I'm back in Putim where I slept in the haystack! Where are you going? I humbly report, to...Budejovice.' To my regiment, But you're going away from Budejovice! Your Budejovice is right behind you, The Putim gendarmerie sergeant was known throughout the district for his very tactful yet sharp way of conducting business. He never swore at those he detained or arrested, but subjected them to such a searching cross-examination that even an innocent man could do nothing but confess. 'The secret of criminal investigation lies in shrewdness and good manners,' the gendarmerie sergeant always said 'Bellowing at anybody doesn't help.' Welcome here, soldier, Sit down comfortably and tell us where you are going. Svejk repeated that he was going to Ceske Budejovice to join his regiment Then you've surely taken a wrong turn, because you're now going away from Ceske Budejovice, Above us hangs a map of Bohemia. And there you'll see, soldier. To the south of us is Protivin. To the south of Protivin is Hluboka and south of that... is what? Ceske Budejovice. And so you see you're going away from Budejovice And yet I'm going to Budejovice. You know, soldier, I shall disabuse you of that idea, and you yourself will come to share my opinion that every denial only makes a confession more difficult! You're absolutely right, Every denial makes a confession more difficult, ...and the contrary. As you'll see yourself, soldier, Answer me if you would be so kind, where you were coming from? Well? I came from Tabor. And what were you doing in Tabor? I was waiting for a train to Budejovice. Why didn't you take the train to Budejovice? Because I didn't have a railway ticket. Why, as a soldier, didn't they give you a free ticket? Because I had no documents on me. So that's it! He's not as stupid as he pretends He's starting to spin a good line,. You were at the station in Tabor, And what did you do there? I chatted to the soldiers. And what, for example, did you chat about? and what did you ask them? What regiment they were from and where they were going. Excellent. And you didn't ask them, for instance, How many men in the regiment and how they were distributed? No, I didn't ask that because I know it by heart for ages. So! So you're perfectly informed about the composition of our army? Of course, Sergeant. Do you speak Russian? No, I don't, I humbly report Did you hear that? He doesn't speak Russian! He's a cunning one! He's admitted everything but the most important thing. Tomorrow we shall send him to the district officer in Pisek. Yes, yes Criminology depends on cleverness and good manners. You saw how I drowned him in a flood of questions? Who would have thought that of him! He looks so stupid and idiotic, but with such people you must have your wits about you. Now you search him properly and I'll go and write a report about it. And be careful! The sergeant took from the cache a secret instruction from Prague Headquarters with the usual: "Strictly Confidential!" So he could read it over to himself carefully once more: That "all gendarmerie stations are strictly enjoined "to keep exceptionally careful watch "on all persons passing through their district. "according to confidential reports, a number of "Russian intelligence agents have found their way into Bohemia. "They speak perfect Czech and appear to be especially dangerous, "because they can disseminate treasonable propaganda "among the Czech population." "The regional High Command therefore orders "first: that all suspicious elements must be detained, "secondly: those detained must be subject to an immediate search" search... "And submit to undergo an immediate search..." Tell me, why do you have absolutely nothing on you? Because I don't need anything. Well, and how do you like being in Bohemia? I like it everywhere in Bohemia. On my travels I found good people everywhere. People are very good and well behaved here. A theft or a brawl here or there Yes, indeed Yes, in case I forget.. What did you want to do in Budejovice? Take up my duty in the 91st regiment. The sergeant wrote: The spy, having mastery of the Czech language, Planned to enlist in Ceske Budejovice in the 91st infantry regiment Lance-corporal! Lance-corporal! Lance-corporal! Have you given the enemy officer anything to eat? By your orders, Sergeant, we serve food only to those who are brought in and interrogated before twelve o'clock. This is exceptional, a high-ranking officer, someone from general staff. You know, the Russians would never send just anyone here as a spy. Send to the "Tom Cat" for some lunch for him. If they have nothing left then cook him something Then make him some tea with rum, don't say who it's for, don't mention to anyone at all who we've got here. Lance-corporal! Lance-corporal! It's a military secret! The sergeant painted in his mind alluring pictures his district commander would pat him on the back and say: "I congratulate you Sergeant!" then would come decorations, promotion to the highest rank, and need of his criminological skills Sergeant... What is it? Did he get lunch? Yes, ham, dumplings and cabbage. There wasn't any soup left. he's drunk his tea and wants another cup. and said "it's cosy and warm in here," Let him have it! That's very cunning of him, He acts as though it didn't concern him. And yet he knows that he'll be shot. We must respect a man like that, even if he's an enemy A man like that is going to certain death. but he sits there calmly and says: "it's cosy and warm in here." I don't know how we would be in his place... We might perhaps waver or give in, Well then now. Did you enjoy it? It wasn't so bad, Sergeant. I could have done with a bit more cabbage. But never mind! I know you weren't prepared. The tea with the rum did me good too. In Russia, is it true they drink a lot of tea? Have they got rum there also? You can find rum all over the world, Sergeant. He's avoiding the question, you hear? Listen, soldier Are there pretty girls in Russia? Pretty girls are also all over the world, Sergeant. He'd give anything to get out of this now. Be careful. What did you want to do in the 91st regiment? I wanted to go with them to the front. That's true. That's the best way of getting to Russia. This fellow doesn't bat an eyelid. That's their military training Have you ever been to Pisek? In 1910, at the Imperial manoeuvres. Did you go through all the manoeuvres? Of course, Sergeant, as an infantryman. His plan was as follows: to insinuate himself into the 91st infantry regiment, and at the first opportunity get to Russia, because he noticed, that the way back would be impossible owing to the vigilance of our security organs That he would have done well in the 91st infantry regiment is quite understandable, because by his own admission he confessed, upon a further cross-examination, that, in 1910, he took part in all the Imperial manoeuvres in the region of Pisek From this it is clear that he is very able in his profession. I should like to add that the indictments which I have collected are the result of my own system of interrogation. Interrogation... Sergeant, Sergeant, he wants to go to the... Fix bayonets! and bring him here. So you want to... Isn't there something else behind this? Honestly, it's just a question of... Just to make sure... I shall accompany you About turn! Quick march! Station yourself at the back and on the right so that he doesn't dig his way out through the cess pit. I hope I wasn't too long inside? I hope I haven't kept you waiting? Oh, not at all, not at all, I wish you good evening. Pejzlarka, run to the "Tom Cat" for beer In my opinion, it's not right to hang spies. a man who sacrifices himself for his duty, for his, as they say, homeland, should be dispatched honourably, with powder and lead. What do you think, Lance-corporal? Certainly he should just be shot and not hanged, Let's say that they sent for me and said: "Lance-corporal go and find out how many machine-guns the enemy have in their detachment." And then we had to disguise ourselves and go. Why would they have to hang me like some robber and murderer? I insist on being shot and buried with military honours! I know! I know...I know must be done I know must be done Correct! The snag is, if he's clever nobody can prove anything against him. And they can, And they can! If they're equally smart. Who have they got there? Some suspicious individual. Just before I left, they both had their arms around his neck and the Sergeant was saying: "My lovely Slavonic boy!" "My little spy!" Tell me that in Russia they haven't got such good Kontusovka as this! Yes? Tell me, so I can go to bed in peace! Confess it like a man! You've made me happy. You've confessed. That's how it should be! If I'm guilty, why deny it? No? I still must add... in addition, that Russian Kontusovka that the Russian Kontu... that the Russian Kontusovka based on Paragraph 56... Write, write So, I am! .Amen Come on! Thank you, Sergeant, for everything you've done for me. When I have the chance I'll write to you Come on! And if I should ever come round here again, I'll visit you! I never thought the way to Budejovice would involve such difficulties. It reminds me of the case of butcher Chaura from Kobylisy. One time at night he came to Palacky's monument in Moran and went round and round it until morning, because he thought that the wall had no end. He was so desperate, by morning he couldn't go on and began to shout: "Help, police!" When the police came he asked them the way to Kobylisy saying that he'd already been walking around a wall for five hours and still there was no end to it. And so they took him with them and he smashed everything in his cell. Hey look! A noose! It must be poachers. It's poachers, Nothing but poachers here,. They wanted to throw the sergeant into the water. The water bailiff on the dam keeps firing shot at their backsides, but it doesn't help. They wear a piece of metal in their trousers, see. The lance-corporal started to talk about progress, How quickly people get on to everything, and how people cheat each other. He developed a new theory that the war was a great blessing for humanity, because in the battles not only good people were shot but lots of rogues and bastards too. In any case there are too many people in the world, Each one's breathing down another's neck and it's awful how humanity breeds... how they breed! it's terrible. That's what I say and I know must be done, Come on, Mr Guard! It's blowing a bloody awful wind, eh Well, how about a glass? I'm saying a glass won't do us any harm. Come on and don't tell anybody I'm taking you to Pisek. It's a state secret. It mustn't get out who you are, Panic. We mustn't allow panic to spread. Panic is a very bad thing in times of war, You say something and it spreads like an avalanche over the whole region. I know what must be done Well, I shan't spread any panic here, My brother here, says we'll be in Pisek in an hour. And so your brother's got leave? Today's his last day! We fooled him all right! Only, no panic, it's wartime. a few drinks can't hurt, insisted the brave lance-corporal when he took Sveijk to the pub He was an optimist; when he had drunk twelve he he stated quite firmly that the District Commander would be at dinner until 8.00, and that there was no point in arriving there earlier and apart from that, a blizzard was coming up. There was plenty of time. As they said in "The Ram", until 9.00, there was enough time And it didn't matter whether they went now or later. Pisek wouldn't run away. Let's be glad we're sitting in a warm place, In the trenches they go through more than us The lance-corporal declared a contest inviting the landlord to keep up with him accusing him of drinking too little, which was obvious slander because he could hardly stand on his legs and he claimed that in the night he'd heard gunfire in the east, at which the lance-corporal hissed "Just no panic!" This is no good. I could easily lose you. Have you got handcuffs on you? Every gendarme must carry handcuffs it's our daily bread. District Police Headquarters PISEK Breathe on me! Now I understand, Rum, Kontusovka, Cert, Jerabinka, Orechovka, Visnovka Breathe again! ...and Vanillkova Coming here drunk, totally sozzled. Crawling here like an animal! Well, what? He's got a report. A report on him will go to court! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! I told you last time, Lance-corporal... that the biggest bloody fool I've ever known is the police Sergeant in Protivin, but judging by this report here the sergeant from Putim has gone one better. Here he writes such rubbish, that every little child could see that he was as drunk as a Papal prelate. These people don't know me. I can be a devil! Until I've made them shit with fright three times a day they seem to think they can put one over on me! Which regiment have you deserted from? From no regiment. I serve in the 91st regiment and not only did I not desert, but the opposite So you can't find your regiment? Let's see, and where did you look?
