[ music playing ] There he is. Every time he passes her, her heart leaps. Oh, she hears him coming, but she's afraid to turn. The tapping cane behind her. Oh, she hears the cane, but she still won't turn. - She will. - No, she won't. - Want to bet? - Mm-hmm. [ seabirds calling ] Told you. But she wants to. Sad. Unrequited love. Evening, Mr. Beausang. [ parrot squawks ] Mm, two chips, please. What about him? Nothing of any conceivable interest has ever happened to him. Ah, but that's something. How? The drabness of his life was so complete as to have its own fascination. Good. - Write it down. - Hmm. Drabness of his life... was so complete as to have... its own... Fasci... ...fascination. - There you go. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. [ cash register dings ] How's it going? Nifty, right. Scottish. Scottish drab. Their skin had that clear, pellucid texture that could have only come from a lifetime's confinement. "Pellucid." Nothing but nuns. Nothing but their nunnishness consoled them, and none but nuns were their friends. The nun-swept pier. Good, "nun-swept." Imagine being a giant and a nun. Oh, don't be so crude, Jimmy. It's only a story. You have to be kind to your characters. How kind? You can't abuse them. Okay. You're the boss. So, you gonna write it all down? Surely. What'll you call it? "Figures on a Nun-Swept Pier." Thanks. See ya. Bye. What are you going to do all summer? Whatever comes up. You could work with me. No, thanks. You could play with me. Why would I do that? Oh, well, pardon me! Sorry for living! It's all right, Da. You can't help it. I'd pay you. How much? - Hah! - How much. What do you think I am, a fucking accountant? I said, "How much?" 1/7 of the door. But, Jesus, what do you care how much? You know, when I was your age, I played to play, and I hadn't even got talent. [ musicians playing ] ♪ Olé!♪ - Well done. - How much? Ah, thanks. Thank you, Sam. See ya, then. To you. Mm. You. Didn't I turn him out well, Tommy? Ah, grand job, Sam. Fair play to you. Don't think it was easy, you know? - Come home. - Hey, let him finish his drink, will you? Whatever you say. Ah, Jimmy, for Jesus' sake. Isn't it finished now? - Enough is enough. - You said it. Oh, enough is enough. There's only so much a man can take. You're right, Da, so come home. - Demand an apology. - What for? For gross abuse of an institution. - What institution? - Fatherhood. Buy me a small one. Eh, Billy, one for the father, and one for the son. I don't want one. Ah, would you lighten up, for fuck's sake? Ah, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E. To Harmony. How is she these days, huh? Come on, Da. Almost there. You all right? Ah, you know, a little bit of understanding wouldn't go astray. I understand. I understand. Maybe you do understand, but it doesn't feel like you do. You know what I mean? And it's no good unless it feels like it. Yeah, okay. I mean, when your mother died... - It wasn't easy. - ...it wasn't easy, you know. I know, Da. I know. And my greatest fear is-- my greatest fear is that you'd end up like that guy-- what's his name-- Scrotum! Who's Scrotum, Da? He's a bit of a bollocks. [ both laugh ] G'night. Will you ever love me, Jimmy? I don't know. Is that because I'll never love you? Probably. Too friendly to be lovers, too close to be friends, together they lived in that twilight zone. It happens. Look. What about her? She got off at the wrong stop. No, she didn't. She's looking for something. How do you know? Observation. Come on. What's she looking for? For the threads of a lost love. You never let up, do you? She's from abroad, you know. So what? Jimmy: We've been collecting, haven't we? You don't think she's a specimen? Don't know yet. What you mean, you don't know? There has to be a story. She's on the run. From what? From her past. What past? I don't know. She killed someone. Jimmy, that's gauche. What's gauche? That is. I mean what does gauche mean? Kind of vulgar, obvious. Jimmy: You tell me, then. Girl: Maybe she's gauche. If she killed someone, she didn't mean to. Turned out to be the perfect murder. Who did she kill? Her husband... on a yacht... south of France. She's waiting for the inheritance. Girl: Gauche, Jimmy, gauche. She's had enough, maybe... wants to swim out and never come back. Better save her from herself. "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes." She looks English, Jimmy. I bet she's French. - Old-fashioned, too. - Stop it, Jimmy. Ahem. Sorry. What did you do that for? I don't know. Think she minded? Course she minded. Still doesn't talk. She's following us. She wants to report you. - For what? - Sexual harassment. Is that what it's called? That's what galls me, you know. What galls you? It could be so good. What do you mean, "Could"? Well, some of us had to try, you know. When I started, I hadn't even got talent. Look at you now. What about me? I had a dream. Ah, don't start. I had this dream, was in this place. What place? It was by the sea, somewhere by the sea, yeah? And these salesmen came along, and they were selling coffins. But they had a funny way of selling coffins. They'd take your hand. They'd read your palm, work out how long you had to live. Then they'd work out some payment installment plan so you could buy your own coffin. They read mine. Do you know what they said? They said... "Ah. You pay in cash." You go to bed, would you? What of my dream? Don't worry. I can't help it! I did my best, you know. Wasn't easy bringing you up, but they look at you now, and they say-- Do you know what they tell me? Yeah, you're a saint. No. They look at you, and they look at me, and they say, "You did well, Sam." That's what they tell me. Piss off. But you know what? What? Think I'll piss off. [ train horn blows ] Didn't I tell you not to hang around with him, Rose? - Who's him? - You, you little git. Ah, hard luck. You watch your tongue, sonny. I can't see it. Can you? You're a disgrace, Coleman. I know. - I blame your father. - Ah, so do I. Shit. I suppose that was my fault, too. Your mother wants you home by 6:00. I prefer yours. - My what? - Your father. Why? I could slit my wrists, and mine wouldn't even notice. - [ train clanking ] - Watch. - Dad! - Rose, come on. Get off the line, would you? Father! What? Nothing! You behave yourself now. Thank you, Jimmy. So, you don't prefer yours? No. I mean, you're like him. I try not to think about it. Look. She's come back. For what? [ overlapping chatter ] Now, what does that mean? The sun's in her eyes. No, she wants to hide. Well, she's in the wrong place. She's a slow reader. You're always criticizing. I am. Now, why is that? Lie down over here. Why should I? Just do it, would you? Now what? Pretend we're lovers when she comes over. Okay. Kiss me, then. Come on. Yeah. Not very convincing. Sorry. [ both laughing ] Hello again. Oh, 'hoy. You do remember me, don't you? You? You showed some interest in my clothes the other day. Oh, that was you yesterday. - Mm-hmm. - [ laughing ] Shut up, Rose. Kiss her again, and she'll stop. Yeah, kiss me again. I want to apologize. That's nice. It's about we had to see that you were French. What made you think that? I don't know. Something about you. Well, I'm American. Why can't you be French? Why should I be? 'Cause I'd win. [ chuckles ] Look, do you always go around messing with other people's things? Only when they're French. Sorry. And you're Irish. [ chuckles ] Sorry. [ chuckles ] What's your name? James. James Coleman. Come on, Rose. You don't have to go. But we're embarrassed, aren't we, Rose? Yeah. Nobody calls you James. She does now. She's nice. So, you've given up on the murder, eh? Yeah. She wouldn't hurt a fly. [ women laughing, chattering ] You see? Nuns remain children longer than most. Now, why is that? It's to do with their lifetime's confinement. Well, maybe it's to do with the soap that they use. How? It gives them that baby skin. What's the word? Oh, pellucid? Pellucid. Big word. Maybe it's that they're married to a man they never meet. Aha. She's up there looking down at me. - Don't look. - Why? I don't know. So, where is she? She's gone. Maybe she was never there. She was, I'm telling you. She was looking down at me. - Isn't that something? - Not really. She's been here, though. Who are you kidding, Jimmy? What's wrong with you? You get a bit of mystery, and you want to kill it. I don't think she's necessarily interesting. More interesting than a bunch of nuns. Look. You're taking this thing too far, Jimmy. No, no, no. Look at her. She just stares at the sea. Very touching. Yeah. P.A.: Attention, please. The train on platform number one runs nonstop to Connolly Station. A woman with a secret. See, she has to have a secret. I don't like this, Jimmy. Why not? That's it. What? That's her secret. She's famous. Never heard of her. Who did you ever hear of? Don't be a bastard, Jimmy. Man: ...and honorable Hiram J. Slade. Can we go back on that, please? - Sorry. - Try to give it a bit more. And come in faster on that, please. - Okay. - A bit faster. One announcement from our mayor... - No, no, no, no, no. - ...the esteemed-- - No. No. - Woman: Sorry I'm late. Sorry I'm late. We're getting quite used to it, Ms. Baker. All right, now do it again. Authority of Hiram J. Slade, the esteemed and honorable - Hiram J. Slade... - Hey! Hey, you! Out! - [ yelps ] - Come on. Jesus. Fucking idiot. Wanker. There is of course the case of the older woman who, tiring of the affections of those her own age, seeks out the company of someone younger. Those stories always end up badly. Why? Can't help it. - Man: Heave! - Look at this. - [ grunting ] - Heave! [ muffled chatter ] Rose: Look at his eyes. They remember everything. In the end, they remember so much, they just lay down and die. What's your name, eh? [ trumpets ] Nepal. And she dance, too. Lift, Nepal! Lift! Fast! Lift! Leave her alone! That's her job. Isn't it, Nepal? - Lift! Lift! Fast! - [ trumpets ] I'll report you! Be my guest. Lift, Nepal! Lift! Lift! Fast! Fast! Fast! How do you know she'll come? One gets to know these things. One does. You see, the trouble with women - of a certain age... - Shut up. ...is that they're of a certain age. [ overlapping chatter ] My sympathies, Jimmy. I know how it feels. One chips, please. I've made it my duty to humanize that brute. How you gonna manage that? Music. What do you mean, music? You wait and see. Ah, you fancy him, then. He has a certain animal grace. Like the elephant? Jimmy, you're jealous. Hey, what's your name, kid? You calling me a kid, huh? Yeah. I'm old enough to be your brother. Oh, you mean my older brother. - Yeah, that's right. - Fine. This is Rose.

And what do you do, James? Nothing. I'm on holidays. Can't do nothing all the time. I play music. Where do you get your talent from? My father. Least, that's what he thinks. And what about your mother? Is she talented, too? She's dead. Tide's coming in. Do you swim here very often? Sometimes. Well, maybe I'll see you again sometime. [ seabirds calling ] - Hi. - James. - Look, I wanted to say... - Yes? ...I'm sorry about that the other day. - Sorry about what? - When you were swimming. Oh. Don't worry about it. Nah, it's a game we play, me and her. We make up stories. - What kinds of stories? - All kinds. We look at you and wonder what on Earth you could be doing in this godforsaken dump. Maybe I like it here. No, that's not the point. We say she's in hiding from a strange and fascinating past. Why do you say that? 'Cause otherwise she wouldn't be here. She might like it, too. No chance. No, she's waiting for the clouds to blow over. Clouds? Yeah, clouds of her past. Then she will return to claim her inheritance. The point being that nothing's what it seems. What's your name? Isadora. Who invented this game? Ah, Rose. She writes it down. So, Isadora, you put on your glasses. Why? More mysterious. That's better. You should go now. I know. Well... good-bye. - Bye. - [ gasps ] Oh, sorry. - You shouldn't do that. - Why not? 'Cause I'm too old. I don't think so. The one you should kiss is the girl. I do. Will you be here tomorrow? Maybe. Will you? I live here. Right. Your glasses. Keep 'em. As a present from a woman who's too old. - See that? - Yeah! Clumsy! You don't think I'm in with a chance? You need a plan! - A what? - A plan! Where one step leads to the other and... - And what? - ...and the aim is achieved! What's the aim? To help to know about yourself! I don't. Maybe you should sleep on it. Would you kiss me like that? Sure. Well? I call feel the absence of any plan whatsoever. You think she felt that, too? Absolutely. See, I don't know about women. Obviously. Did you get to see him? Yeah. Kind of.

Sometimes I wonder how I spend the lonely nights. - Stop that, Jimmy. - Come on. That melody haunts my reverie. Come on. [ crying ] Why does that make you cry? - I don't-- - You do. Stop it, Jimmy. - I can't. - Stop it. Please. You mean you don't like the suit? - Don't you like me? - No. Tell me you don't like me. - Don't! - Why not? I'm in love with you. You can't be. I know I can't, but I am! I won't talk to you like this. - You sure? - I'm sure. - You really want to go? - I have to. Okay, piss off. I said piss off. Jimmy, we can talk about this when we've calmed down. No. You go, and don't come back. Maybe he was right, you know. Maybe I shouldn't see you. - Jimmy-- - I said piss off! [ door closes ] Forgot your bag, didn't you? Jimmy. What you didn't know, you see, was that I knew the minute I saw her. Isn't that something? Yes. I knew. Couldn't tell myself. I needed you to tell me. [ sighs ] I couldn't tell you. I knew, but I didn't know I knew. I like you, you know. Even though you're a pisser, I just-- You're my father. And all I needed you to say was that she was my mother. I was afraid to tell you, Jimmy. Wouldn't have even had to say why she left. Just who she was would have been enough. I'm sorry. You can say it now. She is... What? ...your mother. You hate her, don't you? Why do you hate her? Becomes a habit. Does it? And it's easier than the other thing. What's the other thing? Love. [ music playing ] Course, it's an old story. Is it? The oldest in the book. Though you never know. I don't, you know. Maybe she is dead. Maybe she's a ghost. - [ growling ] - Maybe. Don't be sad, Jimmy. I hate to see you sad. Look, I'm not sad. Good. Hey. I told you not to feed them. Ah, piss off. I warning you! What are you gonna do about it? Something! Well, piss off until you can think of it. Of course he's wild about me. Of course. [ overlapping chatter ] Ma'am! Ma'am! - Ma'am. - Yes? Can I introduce you to someone? Yes. Mr. Beausang! Mr. Beausang! Mr. Beausang, meet Mrs... Ms., boy, Ms. Strange. Olivia Strange. Ms. Olivia Strange. - How do you do? - How do you do? I'm very pleased to meet you. Very nice to meet you. I've very often seen you walking. See? They're talking. Uh-huh. Who knows where it'll end up? - Kiss me. - Why? So he can see. More. Passion! Passion! Drag me down to the ground. Fuck. Look crestfallen. Crestfallen? Don't be sad, Jimmy. Remember to wash your face. [ phone rings ] Woman: Hello. [ elephant trumpets ] Take it off. What? The jacket! Keep shoveling. Come on. Hey, they'll be starting in one minute. - [ whip cracks ] - So? Put them on again! - No! - [ winces ] Jacket first. [ saxophone playing ] [ saxophone continues ] [ muted cheering ] [ doorbell buzzes ] Hello. Hello. - Can I come in? - No. Please? You have to talk to me. No, I don't. I want to say that-- It doesn't matter. I was wrong. It happens. I won't bother you again. How were you wrong? I thought you liked me the way I liked you. I think I left my bag here. Where? Did you find it? No. It's in the kitchen, maybe. Have a look. Where are you going? Out. Woman: Jimmy! You find your bag then, yeah? - Yes. - Good. Jimmy, you have to talk to me sometime. Why? Tell me why? [ musicians playing ] Better ways to kill yourself, Sam. [ music continues ] Jimmy. James. Talk to me. Please. - Don't. - Tell me why not. You have to talk to me, Jimmy. I've lost my voice. Don't. Why not? Because... when I was 17, I came here-- Don't, Jimmy. - Don't! - Tell me why. Because I was new to them, and they were new to me. Because I sang. - Tell me why. - Don't, Jimmy! Don't! - Why? - 'Cause I met your father, and-- Did you tell him to stop? No! [ crying ] Don't. Don't cry, Jimmy. All right. I'm sorry. Then be sorry, but you're dead. You died a long time ago. How can you be sorry and dead? Because I left you. Why did you do that? Because... sometimes people make a mess of things. Why? Because-- because... [ crying ] Don't. I can't help it. Why? Why? Because I found out. [ saxophone playing ] I was singing onstage. He was playing in the pit. I had you. We fought, and he threw me out, and I went because I was offered a job, and I thought that if we moved, we'd be happy, but he didn't come. I came back again. We fought again. He threw me out again. And I thought I had to live my life. Did you live your life? No. I died. Ah, something happened, you see, Tommy. It's like all the atoms congeal. Entropy. What's that? The process of decay, what's in a body... She was too young to have a baby. or an organism... But that's not the thing. ...or a thing. The thing is that something went from being good... to being bad. Chemical change. The thing is that you-- You can never remember exactly when it was. Sometimes you-- Sometimes you think you can put your finger on the very second of... [ sighs ] [ bottle clatters ] Don't know what to say. Nobody told me. I knew since birth, but I still should have been told. Does that mean I'm bad? It's not her fault, so don't go blaming it on her. It's not his fault either. He doesn't know his ass from his elbow... if you'll excuse the expression. So, it must be yours. But then, you're not there. If you are there, you're not listening. But I don't care. I'm just gonna sit here till somebody does something about it. Anything. [ music playing ] - Wait! Grab its tail! - I can't! - [ snarling ] - [ overlapping chatter ] - [ men yelling ] - Look out! See? I had a plan. Good one. Brilliant. - Oh, I got this one! - [ keys splash ] [ yelling continues ] They'll get them back, though. But to have tried, to have done something, rather than nothing. Absolutely. So, are you still sad? Not anymore. Good. That makes me happy. So, tell me the story. It was just like I imagined it... on the hay. Your hair spread out like a fan. Like a seashell. Like a fan. Look, whose hair was it? Okay, it was your hair. My hair, like a seashell on the hay. So, what about the elephant? Well, frankly, the elephant was totally irrelevant to the whole proceedings. How did he feel about that? Elephants don't feel... [ music playing ] ...pellucid. Pellucid? [ music continues ]
