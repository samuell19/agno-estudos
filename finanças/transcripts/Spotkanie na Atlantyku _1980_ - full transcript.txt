KADR Film Studio Presents A Chance Encounter on the Atlantic A film by Jerzy Kawalerowicz Screenplay by Starring Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world... Have mercy upon us. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Another one who can’t sleep. He’s been wandering the decks since dawn. I don’t get these people. Why get on the boat? A plane is faster; they’d already be sleeping in their beds. Why are you so irritated? Everything drives me nuts. This whole goddamn cruise. I can’t sleep. My head is killing me. At least the storm is over. Pressure keeps falling. Another storm is brewing. What if he jumps overboard? Are you crazy? What came over you? Have a drink, get some sleep and don’t upset anyone. If your head was pounding like this you’d be singing a different tune. You scared me. I slept so deeply I didn’t hear you leave. I slept well, I had a shower and now you can kiss me. What’s wrong? Nothing. All is well. So say it. “All is well with me”. It’s just how I imagined this journey. Slow, calm, without any rush. With lots of time to spare… And just us. Alone. Lock the door. Why the long face? Say: “All is well with me”. When was the last time you thought you could die? I’ve got something different on my mind now. Don’t think about it. Think about me. Only me. And nothing else. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's 7:30 am. It's Friday, September 22nd. I hope you haven’t been using my toothbrush? Pardon? Did you say something? No. Just asking. And I’ll lend you the book when I finish it. Let’s make a deal. I don’t care who you are and you don’t care who I am. All right? I don’t care about you at all. So we understand each other perfectly. I understand things. I’m intelligent. That’s good. We have to get to the end of this journey somehow. It’s the second telegram to the same person in as many hours. Who is he? Nowak? Who is it? Steward with breakfast. Just a moment. Good morning. How are you today? Not bad. Yesterday’s storm made many people sick. It wasn’t nice, that’s true. You have to eat a lot now. I brought you everything you ordered. The important thing is that you slept well. By the way, you’re really lucky that the other person backed out at the last moment. You have the cabin all to yourself. But it could have been a really nice person. - Is that also for me? - Unfortunately not. It’s for your neighbor in 224. I’d love to get telegrams like that but you have none for me. I wish I did. The coffee smells divine. I’m famished. Enjoy your breakfast, m’am. What do they want? They’re just being polite. It’s a thank you note. They thanked you yesterday. Maybe it’s customary or they felt they should do it again. You were amazing. They must have loved you. Don’t tell me everyone who gives two lectures gets thanked that much. Yes… Very happy… They’re thanking… “If you happen to visit our university in the following years we’ll be delighted to meet with you”. But why do they put it like that? What do you think it means? What it means?! That they’re not inviting my wonderful wife and me back. If I happen to be in the States I can always come by for a chat. Thank you, I’ll pass. It doesn’t matter… Doesn’t matter? You were hoping you get invited again. If they were so eager to invite you a few days ago and now they're changing their mind, that means someone’s back talking you. It’s not about the trip. It’s about your authority. In the States and at home. Especially at home. Don’t worry about my authority. People have tried to get to me before. No one did. And I don’t have to go back there. I don’t care. So why are you smoking? Your health is the most important. And smoking is bad for you. My vicar isn’t perfect. He looks at me like I took something from him. And I don’t have much myself. The parish is poor. Last nine years have been a struggle. But I do have a lovely garden. You have to come visit me for a few days. No idea what’s going on there. I’ve been away for three months. I was a replacement for father Mierzwiński in San Antonio. I’ve never heard about him. I agreed because I wanted to see that America you all talk about. This different life, the prosperity. And did you like it, father? Well, life’s quite good. That’s true. But your faith isn’t the strongest. Unlike at home. I’m sorry but I don’t feel like having dinner. You go. But we missed yesterday’s supper and today’s breakfast. We haven’t even met the people we’re sharing the table with. It’ll be awkward if we don’t… Quit whining and get dressed, ok? - I don’t feel like it. - Please, don’t do this to me. Don’t you understand that I just don’t feel like talking about nothing with people I don’t know? You keep saying that I’m the unsociable one; that I avoid people and you need them because you need contacts, you need to be sociable. I did say that. But it’s different now so quit forcing me. Oh, God, why do you always have to torment me? I’m not going anywhere. First you want to, then you don’t. First you like something, then you don’t. I do everything wrong. You were so nice to me and now… I’m just not sure… You’ve changed since we got on this ship. What is it? It can’t be that stupid telegram. You said you won’t let it bother you. It’s not the telegram. I’m just… ...nervous. - Forgive me. - Look… My make up is ruined. Why do you always have to make me cry? Our companion is already at the table. He must be very hungry. Good morning. I was just saying that you must be hungry. Because you’re first to sit down. I’m wondering what to have. I wonder, who will be sitting with us. I hope no one will. Our beauty is late. She must have been seasick and now she’s resting. Have you found out her name? No. But there are new people at her table. Another beautiful woman. Yes, please. But she’s spoken for. You’re interested in beautiful ladies, father? I am indeed. And I can even tell you the name of that lady from yesterday. Her name is Irena. And she’s a singer. Do you know the gentlemen at that table over there? Never seen them before. Well, lately you’ve been having trouble remembering things. That’s exactly what I don’t like. I don’t like blatant curiosity. They’d want to know everything. Who, with whom and why. Can’t just live their lives, have to live the life of others. And you’re just the same. I’m just curious who will be sitting with us. And why do you keep repeating that? I’ll be happy if no one sits here. You haven’t met yet. You weren’t here yesterday. Miss Irena, our star on the way back from her American tour. - Mr and Mrs Nowak. - Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you, too. Enjoy your meal. You’re stuck with me for the next few days. I wouldn’t call it stuck. Are you always hungry, because I am. This ship makes me want to eat all the time. I’ll gain some weight again. Can we order or are you waiting for someone? We’re not. You’re traveling alone? Yes. My roommate backed out at the last minute. I have a cabin all to myself. My husband couldn’t wait to see who is sitting with us. He was afraid it’d be someone boring. Sir, we are famished! Is this place taken? Is this place free? One has to take advantage… Of what? Well! That’s fantastic! I thought you’re mute, deaf and can’t understand a thing… Life must be lived, ma’am. One must make most of the sun, the company, the situation… You have no complexes. One has no complexes when one’s in love. And who are you in love with? You. I look at them and I recall the first time we met. You were just as ridiculous and persistent as he is. Remember? I really liked that. I know you don’t like to reminisce and talk about yourself or us. But because of that we hardly know each other. We do know each other. I just don’t like confessions. And unwise honesty. I hate it when people open up to me. There is something… - …brazen about it. - You’re exaggerating. Maybe I am. But to everything there is a season, as the Ecclesiastes says. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to kill, and a time to heal. Who is this? Maybe a spy, a murderer, or a vampire… He huffs and puffs at night. You really try to be funny, don’t you? I do my best, even though I don’t always succeed. And when you sing, you always succeed? I always do. - You don’t want a swim? - No, I have to be careful. Swimming is good for you, it’s something else that hurts you. Excuse me, ma’am. You seem to fancy that gentleman. I’m not entirely sure… You know, father, I’m a practicing Catholic but my life wasn’t as good as I had hoped. - You’re lonely? - I am. What is it that you do? What haven’t I done! I was a porter, a farmer, gas seller, a dancer… I owned a dry cleaning business… I lost it. I didn’t make a fortune. I think... that I’ve made a mistake somewhere along the way. Now, I’m resting. It’s time. For what? For me to go. You’re going to see your family? I have some distant family, but I’d have to find them first. You don’t want to live alone? When my father was dying the whole family gathered around his bed. They prayed, burnt candles. Made it easier for him somehow. You don’t have to think about it yet. I’m old. What are you talking about? Elephants go back to their birthplace before they die. That’s the way it must be. So what are our plans? Our plans? We do have plans together, don’t we? Well… no. You’re going to your cabin, and I’m going to mine. Just the man I wanted to see. How can I help you, ma’am? I’ll be on my way. Excuse me. Why are you so uneasy and tense all the time? Lie down, rest. That’s why we took the boat. Stop thinking about that nonsense. I’m trying not to. You should have gone for a swim. Have you noticed how many weird people are on this ship? And that young man is flirting with Irena. And sharing the cabin with the bald guy or the priest. I’m not sure yet. Did you see the bald one? The tall, well built one. He was swimming while we were at the pool. Did you notice how amazing his eyes are? Just like that clairvoyant we were seeing, remember? I think I saw him before. I just can’t remember where. Or maybe I just think I did. Why aren’t you saying anything? Because I don’t know him. I didn’t say you knew him. So why are you talking about him so much? I love it when you’re jealous. Come in. - You’ve ordered double whiskey. - I did, thank you. Don’t drink. It’s too late for that. Fine, but you’ll go for a walk with me. No, I won’t. So I’ll go alone. Did I scare you? No, but… I am afraid of something. I’m so glad you’re here. I’m so exhausted. I haven’t slept a wink. - Did you take something for it? - I did but it doesn’t help. I’ve been sailing for too long. Thirty years is enough. One more voyage and then I’m staying ashore. I’ll rest. You’ve said it so many times before. I did. But this time I’m done for real. Excuse me. After you. It’s unbelievable. Truly unbelievable. I would have never expected that we’d meet in the middle of the ocean. That’s truly remarkable. A happy coincidence, I suppose. How many years was it? Many. But you look great. Really amazing. You haven’t changed much. And that’s good. You look quite well yourself. Nice to see you. I’m sure we’ll meet again. Why can’t we talk now? Not much to do here. Where were you going? I haven’t made up my mind. So let me take you to the bar. The decks are too windy. Let’s have some cognac. It’ll do us good. It can do wonders for those of us with a heart condition. - You have a heart condition? - Yes. I already had it back then. But it’s not that bad. Oh, and the lady is here. Do take us upstairs, to the bar. Of course. That’s strange but I think that you’re taller now. Maybe you are shorter? Everyone changes over time. You know, sometimes I see a face and can’t for the life of me remember where I know the person from. It bothers me. But you I recognized immediately. Thank you. Your head, your height, your energetic walk… When did we see each other last, anyway? Well, we haven’t seen each other since then, but I’m glad that we finally have a chance to talk. - It’ll be swaying again, huh? -The pressure’s constantly dropping. Thank you. Low pressure bothers you? Because it bothers me. But that’s natural. Everyone’s body is affected by such low pressure. But I don’t have to tell you that. You know it perfectly well. Cheers! What is that you’re doing now? Nothing in particular. You were in Canada? - And in other places. - On business? No. I was sightseeing. I’m not that lucky. I always travel on business. I’m coming back from a geriatric conference. I gave a lecture which was very well received. But I cannot take all the credit. We have great achievements in geriatrics. I was offered to give a series of lectures. I’ve accepted because our approach to geriatrics isn’t only medical but also social, psychological; all in all, humanistic. I’ll go back next year. You could have at least let me know where you went. I see that you met after all, gentlemen. I’m this gentleman’s wife. You’re not allowed to drink. And you shouldn’t be talking him into it. I’ve never talked anyone into anything. My wife always arrives at the least appropriate moment. - You share that opinion? - I’m not experienced enough. You were in America? Yes. How long? Too long. Where exactly were you? Different places. You’re very mysterious. Do excuse me. You took the key to our cabin. I can’t get in. The key? I have to look for it. Do excuse me. Who is he? He was a promising doctor. People said he was very talented. You didn’t want to meet him here, did you? Would you like some more cognac? Two more. Here it is. I keep having trouble with this lock. What are you doing with that damn key? You say you don’t have it and then you take it out of your pocket. A magic trick, was it? I wanted to get away from my opponents. From the professor and his lovely wife? And I thought you wanted to have a brush with greatness. You’re judging by your own standards. Oh, no. I truly detest such pompous individuals. Because you envy them. No, I don’t envy anyone. Neither him, nor you. I just don’t like social climbers. Or those who fall for that matter. I’m just not interested in that. I’m in competition with no one. Are you interested in anything at all? Flying saucers, mysticism, after life. So? I have a proposition. I thought you might come up with one. I wanted to have a serious talk with you. There's a storm. It’s always dangerous. You can’t be alone. Will we be talking over the threshold? You lied that you didn’t know him and now you won’t tell me who he is. Do you always have to torment me with your curiosity and good advice? You’re afraid. That’s why you don’t want to say anything. You’re afraid of him and you’re afraid of me. Who is he? No one. But I’ll tell you who you are. You’re a stupid, malicious, miserable goose. You’d be nothing without me. A lousy doctor in an old people’s hospital. You’d be sitting in their stink touching their wrinkled bodies… You owe me… Me! You mean to hurt me and I’m just trying to help. I’ll forget what you said. I didn’t mean to say it. But you always want to be fair, always want to know who’s to blame. I am to blame. I did the wrong thing. But if we’re to be together, we cannot look for blame. We just have to be together. For better or for worse. You don’t get it. I don’t want to judge, I just want to know. It won’t change a thing whether you know my business or not. I have to know what kind of man you are. I want to know what it means when you’re silent. Are there matters I’m not allowed to know about? I don’t know if you know that man, if you’re afraid of him but I want to be on your side and I can’t. Try to understand that. So what is it about? Me or that man? You. You. And everything else. You think, I am to blame. That it was me who hurt him. No! He was stupid back then. Stupid! Naive! He didn’t know the rules and he finished himself off. Times weren’t kind to him. The criteria were different, do you understand? It just wasn’t his time. He couldn’t adapt. You don’t choose the time you live in. You adapt to it. He didn’t know how or didn’t want to. That’s why I was afraid. I was afraid that my fate would depend on him. You’re still afraid of him. No. But fear is hidden deep under our skin. It’s under yours, too. And we never know when it’ll make itself known. I used to think it was normal. I acted soberly and sensibly. Out of fear. Out of fear! Out of fear! I know you hate me. You should. I would hate myself if I were you. But I have to explain something. You don’t know me. And I have no intention of knowing you. Please, listen to what I have to say. It’s very important. What happened in the past... What past? We don’t have a common past. You have your past, and I have mine. Come, join us. - Quite windy, isn’t it? - Sure is. I was just talking about a man from my parish. He was honest and hardworking. But when he started drinking, he changed completely. He became aggressive and impossible. Let’s drink to the drunks! No. Cheers! Easy for you to joke, when you know what you can do and how much do. But my parishioners are simple people and I have to keep telling them not to drink, not to steal, not to fornicate or lie. Such is my calling. I just love such preachings. Don’t steal, don’t lie, love thy neighbor. Very nice, indeed. It’s better to tell the truth than to lie. Better to love the world than to hate it. But it means nothing. Like in that saying: better to be healthy and rich than sick and poor. I don’t know that one. But it means nothing, father. It’s an empty saying. Nothing comes out of it. Don’t lie? Fine. But we have to ask who is lying. Why is he lying? The truth must be told when necessary. But just as well, when it’s necessary one has to lie. Great! Let’s learn how to lie well. As a doctor, I know what I’m talking about. When a man is to die, when we’re sure there’s no saving him, then sometimes we tell him the truth. Sometimes, father. And very often, people can’t handle that truth. Despite everything, they believe they’ll live. Every fiber, every pore of their body, the whole biology lie to them because that’s what they need. It’s not a lie, sir. It’s hope. They need hope. Hope! Hope. Cognac. The word means nothing. Why don’t we go and stretch our legs. - Excuse me. - Till dinner! Excuse me, father. Just one question. Do you provoke your parishioners to tell the truth during confession? If one feels a need for confession, there’s no need to provoke them. True. Don’t drink so much. Don’t drink… You’re just like that priest. It’s for your own good. For my own good. Cognac? Here you go. You’re drunk! What’s going on, gentlemen? What happened? Our friend here had too much to drink. Maybe you can convince him it’s true, father. Sir, please get up. I’ll help you. I’ll walk you to your cabin. Leave me alone, father, I beg you. Everyone seems agitated today. It’s because of the storm but it’ll pass. I myself hate the wind, and my whole body aches when the weather changes. A strange day. A strange day. So many things are strange. And do you know what’s the strangest, father? That there were two Christs. Strange, isn’t it? There were two! One was crucified and buried. Which explains the resurrection. The other walked out of the grave. But that’s all just a mystification, father. A mystification! Do you believe in God? You want to interrogate me, father? Or maybe you want me to confess? Don’t talk like that. It doesn’t become an intelligent man like yourself. You don’t like intelligent men, father. You prefer small ones. They are the ones you promise salvation to. You won’t hurt me. You want to show me how magnanimous you are and immune to insults. You’re all just God’s clerks. And if God really exists, he must really hate you. He cannot be made into money, authority or ruling. No... Don’t listen to me, father. I’m not feeling well. It’s not a good day. Not good at all. He hung himself on a nylon rope. He was unconscious by the time they cut him down. The dog alarmed the whole house, they were trying to revive him for over an hour. He ate breakfast… And then… I didn’t want to see him. I was afraid to see a red line on his neck. He hung himself because of me. But no one knew that, except him and me. Do you hear me? I knew him neither before, nor after. I didn’t want to kill him. It didn’t even cross my mind, that it might cause so much trouble. Does he want revenge? I don’t know. But the fear remains. I wanted to… understand… what’s it like. A man ties a rope, puts a noose on his neck… And then…? Once I went to the garage and tried to see how it is. I can still feel the tightness. I’m sweating, don’t you get it? I’m sweating out of fear. Why aren’t you saying anything? Touch me. Touch me. Why the hell did we get on this cursed ship? Had we taken a plane, we would already be home. You can always get off. You’ve become obnoxious and unpleasant. It was your idea to take the boat. The sea, the peacefulness… Lots of time for each other. But you knew exactly how to spoil everything. You’re right. I do what I never wanted to do. I say what I never wanted to say. I lose my self - control. We kindly inform the passengers that the requests for radio calls today will be taken at the radio cabin at 5 pm. You again… I feel awful. I got really drunk yesterday. That wind was terrible. You know, in the mountains, such wind makes people crazy, too. It brings out all their anger and hatred. You’re sensitive to the mystery of nature. I came here to apologize to you. You keep apologizing to me. For yesterday and for the past. But especially for the past. You made a mess and it’s bothering you now? So be it. After all, I don’t care about it one bit. Anyway, did we know each other? I see that you don’t want to remember. My memory is very obliging that way. I don’t remember what I don’t want to. I understand. Unpleasant things are always best forgotten. You don’t understand anything. I wanted all the best for you. I didn’t want you to get hurt. I hardly knew you and yet I wanted to help you. And? Did you? It hadn’t even crossed my mind that I might cost you your practice. But that’s the way it works. I just mentioned, that you can’t be trusted. That’s all. I wasn’t entirely wrong. You weren’t completely loyal. You have to admit that. No. I don’t have to admit anything. You’re not easy to talk to. I truly believed that then. I wasn’t lying. I was telling the truth. Interesting. The real truth? Or, as you put it, the necessary truth? Necessary for whom? The sense of what we’re saying isn’t entirely up to us. It’s up to those who listen. They want to hear something and to ignore something else. Nothing we can do about it. But you didn’t know that back then. No. I just tried to be loyal. Loyal. It’s the second time I hear that word. Is one of us loyal while the other is not? You’re very insecure. Sir, I tried being honest with you and civil while I didn’t have to be. I could have walked passed you pretending we had never met. Or that everything was all right. You wouldn’t have asked about anything. Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn’t. What’s interesting, is why you keep trying to explain yourself to me. There is something suspicious about it. No, sir. It’s because people need to be honest with each other. It’s a grand word! Very grand! Maybe you just want to convince yourself that you’re honest? Maybe you’re not sure? I don’t like when people like you use such big words. I’ve seen that before. The world is full of such people. It’s because of people like you that I had to leave, and it’s because the likes of you I now have to go back. I just don’t know why and what’s waiting for me there. Good evening. Good evening, professor. Please let me wish you happy birthday on behalf of the captain, all the officers and other members of the crew. We wish you a long, prosperous life. I’d like to present you with a commemorative diploma and a birthday cake from the stewards. All the best, professor. Ladies and gentlemen, as tradition commands… To work, professor. Fifty is neither too much, nor too little. You should manage with a single blow. Get ready. - Champagne ready? - It is. We’re waiting, professor. You’re not allowed to help. I thought I could, him being my husband. You have to do it again. And you will light them up. We all drink champagne to the professor’s health! And you, professor, have to put them out in one blow. Ladies and gentlemen! To the health and prosperity of our birthday boy. It’s ready. Are you ready professor? Well, we’re waiting. Don’t blow the cake off the table! Buffoon. Ladies and gentlemen, all the best to the professor! For he’s a jolly good fellow, For he’s a jolly good fellow, For he’s a jolly good fellow, and nobody can deny! Happy birthday! Once again, all the best, professor. I was just telling a story of a man who had a very evil dog. The dog would bite everyone but he loved his master. He would fawn and lick the man’s hands. He was a good man, kind and honest. He wouldn’t hurt a fly and the dog felt it. Once, the man returned home very agitated. He’d beaten a boy who stole his fruit. He entered the house and wanted to pet the dog. But the dog grabbed his hand and bit him painfully. The man was deeply hurt by it. You want to say, father, that God spoke through dog’s teeth? No. I’m just telling a story. My dog died. He was an old mutt but we were close. When he died I thought I’ll go back to my country. To get a purebred dog? I haven’t been home in quite a while. I’m going there for the first time. I don’t need a dog. I’m going home to die. Alsatians are the most vicious. They’re even trained in aggression. Do you know why alsatians, purebred dogs, are so dangerous? Because they’re the biggest cowards. They attack everyone to fight their own fear. I lost you in my dreams In a sum of your bad days In a mad dash to perdition When you wanted to embrace the world. I lost your face Reflected in my tears I’m calling you It’s me I’m calling you From vastness of the night I’m calling you… I’ve had enough. It’s turning into a nightmare. Like a star in the Milky Way I’m calling you Like a nonexistent light I’m calling you From that last loneliness… Quit it. - What’s wrong? - Just stop. Nobody likes it. Leave me alone. Father, why did she stop? What happened, Miss Irena? Why aren’t you playing? Why did you stop? Your attention, please. I have a special announcement for you We will be passing a lone sailor sailing around the world. He is about a mile away from the starboard. We’re trying to establish contact with him. We will keep you posted. Maybe it’s that Englishwoman they lost touch with a few weeks ago? It’s very interesting. Let’s go and see. Take your glasses. We’ll serve champagne on deck. Ladies and gentlemen, go to your right. God, how brave! What a brave man it must be! Would any of us do something like that? Maybe he’s just looking for fame and money or is advertising plastic products? Maybe it’s the English lady? Your attention, please. I have an announcement. The lone sailor’s name is Isacsson and he is Norwegian. We’ve just established radio contact. He’s sailing around the world. He’s been at sea for 237 days. I wonder what his erotic life looks like. You think that’s the most important? We shall be trying to broadcast our conversation with Mr Isacsson over the loudspeaker system. Mr Isacsson thanks you for your greetings. He feels very well. He’s a little bored so we’ll try to entertain him. He’d like to talk to you. Please ask your questions to the officer on the deck. Here! I’m here! Does he feel homesick? How old is he? The questions is how old is he. He says he is very young, his whole life is still ahead of him. But how old is he? He is seventy. Did you hear? Seventy! Are there any more questions? Which port is he heading to? Is he happy? What about the storm? He is happy. Do you have any more questions? Is he free? Question is: Is he free? Mr Isacsson doesn’t understand. Free of what? He is alone on the ocean. Is he free of fear? Is he free of fear? There is no fear in the ocean, or in the boat. Fear can only be in me. And I’ve rejected it. So, yes. I am free. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve lost contact with Mr Isacssonem. Let’s wish him friendly winds once again. Thank you. Let’s drink to that brave Norwegian. What an incredible man. Truly incredible. - Here. - To the brave Norwegian. Cheers. I forgot about your birthday. For the first time, I forgot. Kiss me. I’m sorry for what happened. He made me lose my temper. No matter. Nothing works out in my life, anyway. I’ve been touring the States for two months and it made no sense. I thought those concerts were important. You have a lovely voice. When I’m on stage and people are applauding I think that everything’s fine. That it all matters. But to be honest… So why did you go to the States? I don’t know. And now you know? No, I never knew what to do with myself. Someone else always thought about it. When I’m back I’ll be telling everyone how successful I was. For that’s how it should be. I’m silly. You’re smart and amazing. Good evening, sir. - Let me invite you, sir - Madam… to the captain’s ball. I used to love balls when I was young. Good evening. On behalf of the captain, officers and entire crew I welcome you at the farewell captain’s ball and invite you to dance. Look, there are places over there. Let’s go to them. Come on. I’ve danced a mandatory dance with my husband and now I’m thirsty. - I’ll go order champagne. - Thank you. You’re great to dance with. - It was a pleasure. - For me too. - May I have this dance? - Of course. I was waiting for someone to ask me. And now I’ll dance with the professor. And we’re just sitting here like we were in our bunks. I see that you made friends with the professor after all. What are you plotting there? We’re talking about things. He’s intelligent as well. Zbyszek, you do know everything but you’re not good at reading people. You’re intelligent but you lack intuition. I know everything about you and you know nothing about me. Thank you. I’ll ask you again. I’ll be waiting. Will you dance with me? Here it is. Thank you. Amazing, wonderful. And now I’ll dance with you, father. Miss Irena, had I expected this I would have worn a tie. But I have an idea. Dance with Józef. With me? With you! Let’s dance, Józef! I haven’t danced in a long time. Solo! Wonderful! Wonderful! Thank you. Let’s go. You tricked me, Józef. You’re a great dancer. Bravo, Józef! Bravo! I’m not going for a purebred dog. You deserve champagne. Wonderful! - I used to dance. - You still do. He almost had a heart attack. We’re on this boat so he can rest. Whatever you think about him, he’s a wonderful man. And you’re an amazing wife. I’m not his wife. I am not his wife, we’re just friends. We work in the same hospital, he’s my boss. He suggested I go with him. Why shouldn’t I tell you that? Excuse me… Do excuse me but Ms Irena promised me something. Ladies and gentlemen, we have among us an amazing singer whom I don’t have to introduce. Miss Irena agreed to sing for the captain and for you. Irena, the floor is yours. I lost you in my dreams In a sum of your bad days In a mad dash to perdition When you wanted to embrace the world I lost your face Reflected in my tears I’m calling you It’s me! For fear and stillness of dreams For a moon that’s full and new I’m calling you For sin of existence For eternal twinkling of an eye I’ll find your face Your eyes silently scream Your tears are in my tears I’m calling you… From vastness of the night I’m calling you Like a long gone star I’m calling you Like a star in the Milky Way I’m calling you Like a nonexistent light I’m calling you From that last loneliness I’m calling you From a run through time, from the ignorance I’m calling you From ignorance to knowledge hunger On contempt of crowds I’m calling you Into blackness and being stray For fear and pain For dying I’m calling you You I’m calling you I’m calling you From ignorance to knowledge hunger On contempt of crowds I’m calling you Into blackness and being stray Into fear and pain For dying I’m calling you You You’re one of those people, who only like insinuations and allusions. So no one ever knows what is true and what is a lie. Nothing is ever clear and evident. He’s just the same. He keeps saying that for everything there is a season. Maybe… Maybe it’s true. But the season never comes for the most important things. Yes. It’s beautiful what you’re saying but a bit naive. Everyone has a tender spot. Why poke at it? It doesn’t heal, just hurts. I would know. I know it from experience. You... You remind me of a wolf waiting for a moment of weakness. You want him to be afraid of you. You want to paralyze him with fear. You know nothing. I do. I do know. He told me everything. You don’t know everything. I do! I know what you went through. I know it was awful. But it’s not entirely his fault. It was the times. And you’re not completely blameless. He… He can be reckless and has moments of weakness. But he’s not a bad man. He is… …just like the others. But if this matter takes away his peace after so many years it means that he’s better than most. You think that you were his victim. But it doesn’t give you the right to torment and frighten him now. He accosted me to tell me something I never wanted to hear. And the fear is within him. He’s afraid of himself. How can you say that? I can. I can, because I’ve never seen him before. We’ve never met. Are you mad? You’ve known each other for years. I’ve never seen your husband before. We met here, on this boat, for the first time. So why? Why did you pretend to be someone else? What for? I just don’t know. At the beginning I listened to him. I had no idea what I was getting into. And then it was too late. Maybe I should have told him at once that he’s taking me for someone else, but… there was something about it… Something awkward, cruel even. And just like that, it sucked me in. For I looked at him in a similar way I look at myself. And that was unbelievable. Try to understand, that was amazing. Who are you? I’m a forty-eight-year-old architect who has achieved nothing. Not enough? My wife left me, and my friends let me down. I have nothing to return to, and yet I’m going back. You want more? No! But… Who are you? I don’t know. I don’t know if I’m the man he’s thinking about. But I know for sure that I’m a bit similar to him. The difference is that he has you and I have no one. I’m alone. Let’s go. Bravo, professor, bravo! - Was it nice on deck? - Very. I think we’ll be going. Time to go. One more for the road. We’re not leaving yet. - I’m staying, too. - Cheers, Józef. To everyone here. Professor. Have a great night. Good night. - What did you tell him? - That I love you. - That’s all? - That’s plenty. - And what did he say? - I’ll tell you later. Professor, take a cigar. May I? It’s been ages since I smoked a good cigar. I don’t even remember the taste. It’s Cuban. Have a good rest. I fancy you. I felt it was a mistake. It’s not possible to be so unforgiving. None of this was true. There was no red line on the neck. If there was, it wasn’t because of you. It’ll all be different now. You’ll walk a lot. You’ll be taking care of yourself. Sometimes we’ll go to the country. I want nothing from you, just to be with you from time to time. Everything will be well. Quickly! Stretchers and oxygen! My husband is having a heart attack! - Which cabin? - 224. What’s going on? You’ll be able to return to your cabins shortly. Why can’t you tell us anything? Captain’s orders. It’ll take five minutes, don’t be nervous. Why can’t we go now? Orders. - Was it someone close? - No. But you knew him? I think I did. Why don’t we go outside, father? See the sunrise. No, Józef. I’ll pass. I’m going to my cabin. Translated by: Emilia Puszczyńska
