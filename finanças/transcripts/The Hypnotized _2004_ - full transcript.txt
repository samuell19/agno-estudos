KIM Heasoo KIM Taewoo Executive Producer JUNG Hoon Tack Written and Directed by KIM Inshik HYPNOTIZED "The season is unclear, time is passing slowly..." "The sea is silent" "On a gleaming yacht, a man in working clothes..." "...watches a woman on the shore, fluttering like a scarf in the breeze" "She basks in his bright smile" What's his name? What's her name? It'll probably come to me later Let's leave it for now "The woman looks back" "The man on the back deck of the yacht is reading a book" "His face is a blank" "He's forgotten her... ... he's just amusing himself' "It snows endlessly" "The red numbers on the board..." "Now she smiles at him and it occurs to her..." "...that love ... could come out of the blue at a moment like this" "One day, the man asks her..." "...if she'll leave with him" "It's time for me to leave the sea" "She finally... ... smiles at him" "it... ... snows... ... endlessly" "The red numbers on the board... ... change constantly, in a blur" But where was this happening? Where did it snow non-stop? Jisu Jisu Ativan, 4mg IM, instead of Valium! Quiet... don't worry... I'll see you again when you've had some sleep Now, close your eyes... One... two... three... We'll monitor her carefully, of course... Our provisional diagnosis is... ...Borderline Personality Disorder We usually call it... ...'BPD' for short May I smoke? How is your relationship with your wife? There's no real problem 'BPD' usually follows rejection, or the fear of rejection In the worst cases... ...the patient can regress into schizophrenia She's showing the typical symptoms of 'BPD' When did you realize there was a problem? On my first birthday party after we married... ...she told everyone... ...that she was going to write a novel every month After that, she locked herself in her room and started writing like crazy One day I got a call from her editor He wanted to meet me He said she was really bugging him She was turning up at his office without warning And she threatened him on the phone He ended the call by saying... ... I should get her to see a psychiatrist Jisu, if it was any good I'd publish it! But there's no way! You publish rubbish all the time! Why do you... ...always reject mine? Watch the yen, it may go still higher Not a chance, buy euros! It's on your head! - We definitely get out of the yen? - Just do what I said! I'm a foreign-exchange dealer It's very stressful I didn't have enough time for my wife One day she called me at work She was holding a party that evening to celebrate finishing her novel She'd invited everyone But no-one came She did many things on impulse I begin to realize that was a real problem Jisu! Honey, It's me I can't sleep, and melatonin isn't helping I don't know how the days are going by Could you play my CD? How long is it since we saw each other? I miss you a lot... And I want to ask you... Have you rejected me too? No answer? Then it's okay! I figure if you don't answer me that means you still love me Yes! You won't reject me... No! I'm rejected... So... ...you slit your wrist because of your mother? Doctor, you can't believe it was that simple! My stepfather... ...comes to my bed, every night It's disgusting... ...more disgusting than you can imagine But you know what? I like doing it with that jerk Waiting for him night after night, shuddering... ...it makes me feel as if I'm an animal Lee Suyeon She claims her father sexually abuses her But I can't yet judge if it's true Yu Jisu... She looks great She's close to 'BPD' HY She's the one I'm most worried about Please pay special attention to her Are you really quitting the post? How did the chief react? "Sort out something for the hypnosis class... ...before you go" Yes He'll have trouble running that class without you Tough, but I can't go on here Well The patient died today Who? The brain-dead man It's as if getting you and your wife to quit your jobs... ...was the only thing that kept him alive You surely don't believe what Suyeon says? She calls him her stepfather? She really is our daughter If this goes on my husband will end up needing treatment We should've moved her to another school as she wished A father who slept with his own daughter... ...would be no better than an animal - It would be better if I was dead - Shut up! Get a grip! Get a grip! Stop talking nonsense We should've moved her to another school. His stupid wife worked here too... It's his fault that she died... You don't believe me, do you? But it's an open secret That idiot doctor probably believes... ...what they tell him sobbing that I'm their real daughter It's all bullshit You have to believe me! Suyeon! This cell phone... I don't need it anymore You can have it It's all over... Doctor Your last patient is still waiting Another doctor will take care of you from tomorrow Don't worry, he's a better doctor than I am Jisu But even the best doctor... ...in the world can't help you if you don't speak - Doctor... - Yes? Go on... Am I locked up here? No You're free to go whenever you want I want to go home Then please promise me that... ...when you've left here... ...you'll go on with the treatment Good-bye Doctor! You're late Jisu's not in her room! Where is she? She was there just now... ONE YEAR LATER What a great clinic! All you need now is a good wife What do you want me to do? I've had no problem with this card before Try it again! It's no good, the card has been blocked Please, other customers are waiting Can't you pay cash? This is ridiculous! Try it again! I've tried it three times already If you can't pay cash, please return the goods to the shelves I'll pay! You'll just have to wait for a minute You aren't answering? It's my wife I know it is, but take her call! The phone gets on my nerves Minseok! You can't do this to me! You can't get her out of your head Can you? Are you... ...thinking of her when we make love? I'll ask you again How long do we have to go on like this? What do you want me to do? Where did you park? Yes... Thank you for your help Have we... ...met before? I'm not sure Then... Why did you help me? Well... just... You must be well off paying bills for someone you don't even know Don't you recall... I'll transfer the money to your account tomorrow You're going to leave me too What do you mean? I'm here, aren't I? I'm sorry I blocked the credit card I'll have it reactivated When people get to know me they always leave me... And then they all forget me I'm so tired... Let's get some sleep Let's divorce We just hurt each other I want a divorce Whatever you want... You must be a lonely man All of your pictures are so empty Don't you mind letting your patients see into your mind like this? If that's what you think... Your wife looks beautiful Oh yea? She'll be happy to hear that I've seen a clock like that before... Is there something you want to tell me? I'm not your patient! I transferred the money, you can check We have met before How did you come up with this? Most people who come to see me are depressed Sometimes... ...I don't even know... ...who I am I thought you called me because you wanted to meet for a drink Actually, you just want to see the files Sorry, I can't let you Patient confidentiality, you know Since when have you followed the rules so obediently? I wrote them in the first place what's the problem? A woman? What are you up to? What are you doing? That's Suyeon, she was your patient The man was her real father But I don't know about the rest of the story... People are so complicated! Don't stare at her! It'll only upset you I forgot my ID card number My e-mail password... Even the entry-code for my apartment building I can't... Sometimes I spend the whole night wandering the streets Why is this happening to me? Cats and dogs don't speak! Why... ...do people talk so much? Doctor I hate the whole human race! We're in the same class, she and me Her name is Lee Sunjoo I just wanted to get her attention So I took photos of her and sent them to her... Since then, I haven't been able to sleep From her point of view... It's true that it was very late at night... ...when I gave her the photos But that can't be why she rejects me Who is that? My husband has a mistress I'm thinking of divorcing him... ...and not just because of this woman Tell me about yourself Stop sounding like a shrink! I'm not in a good mood Tell me about yourself first How do you get on... ...with your wife? She's in the States right now Working as... ...a resident anesthetist Virtually separated, then? Sort of I spent some time with her there after I quit the hospital job I drove her around Tried to be a proper husband for a change We don't have any children Boring story, right? I have... ...a lot of stories to tell My wife wants a divorce She got in first, then What did you tell her? I agreed So everything's working out Isn't it? Does she know about me? I don't think so Then why does she want the divorce? And... why are you in such a bad mood? Does it... ...make you feel guilty? - Haeyoung... - I'm listening... I can't leave her... I'm sorry We'd better stop seeing each other Bastard! Now you're getting in first - What is it? - Can't you see her? I see them sometimes It used to scare me... ...but now I take them for granted She looks so sad Who? The woman... ...walking with us We were twins We looked exactly like each other... ... but our personalities were opposites One day it struck me... What if... ... she disappeared? Hurry up! I was so nervous I forgot which glass was poisoned As I slowly drank the milk... I thought... ... one of us... ... should disappear from this world So, which of you died? My sister! She vomited milk... Stop lying Telling lies for fun is also a kind of sickness Sickness? Don't use such words with me! Don't forget I'm not your patient! You never went back to the hospital, did you? So you've finally recognized me! Sorry You've changed a lot Jisu, you may need help... That's why you come to see me, isn't it? If telling a lie makes me a patient then what about you? Your wife's at Johns Hopkins? Fine then you'll be very happy when she comes back "She's on the run from her salvation" "Like the glow of your eyes..." "...in the windy night" "I can see you..." "...in the endless dark..." "...tired and afraid" "Would my smile..." "...make you come?" "Would my words..." "...make you come?" My wife... was an anesthetist in the same hospital There was one hyper-sensitive patient... It wasn't exactly my wife's mistake... but the patient... never woke up after surgery I may be a psychiatrist But I'm also an ordinary husband What's the matter with you? I told you not to do this Are you crazy? Do you want to die? Go ahead Kill yourself She made me angry... ... irritated me By the way... ... she had a lover He kept on calling her number I listened, but never said anything It was my revenge on him How long is it since we saw each other? I miss you a lot It was all my fault that she died If I'd been more sensitive... ... she wouldn't have gone like that You go by yourself You've changed your mind again? Maybe... What do you really want? Your mood is constantly changing I get so nervous... But they're all friends! Not my friends The way... ...they stare at me... I don't like it. Stare at you? Please try to get a grip! I'm sick and tired of your vacillations Sorry I had no one else to call It's alright, Jisu See you tomorrow! Another round of the Lying Game? You find it difficult? I can't... Jisu you have to relive the memory to deal with it It's all past anyway Before I got married I loved a man... Han Jangseo... A man named Han Jangseo... I can't... I can't remember Look up and focus Now, Jisu slowly close your eyes... Relax... You're standing... ... in front of the gate of... ... your saddest memory Now, reach out with your hand Open the gate Now slowly very slowly go inside He kisses me Soft and... ...warm Yoonsu Why don't you take over my clinic? I don't think I'm up to running it You're crazy Only just noticed? I've always been crazy! Yoonsu... I saw my wife What are you talking about? Maybe I am crazy... ...but I really saw her I'm telling you the truth She was there... ...with an armful of flowers One day... ... my lover tells me... ... that I should go back to where I was Go back and start writing... ... so I can read whenever I want to see him My love is leaving me... ... as if he is a wind I'm crying How can he leave like that? Without another word... Did I cry? It's always hard... ...to bring up painful memories I must go Actually, I had a row with my husband If I'm late, he'll be worried I'll drive you I'll take a taxi Jisu... Call me if you ever want company for dinner Doctors can't fall in love with their patients But that principle has no meaning... ...when it's already happened Not just a patient, a married woman! How could you go so far? She plans to divorce her husband So you're even considering marriage? I can't live without her now She was willing to sleep with you? Don't tell me you... She's so different when she's not hypnotized So it's hard for me - Seokwon! - I want to find out for sure! What? Whether she loves me or not... ...when she's not under hypnosis Keep to the speed limit How much are we down? Two mil... The chief will kill us Hey, Minseok! Do you hear me? We're two million dollars down! Pull yourself together! Minseok, say something! This is on your watch don't drag us into it too Shit, I can't stand this! I'm moving to another team No, there's too much damage I know there's a problem with your wife... ...but you can't work like this I'll make it good I've tried to cover for you But you've picked up a bad reputation in the firm What's the key thing in this line of work? Focus! Lose it, and it's all over Solve your domestic problems first then maybe we can work together again You'd better go Call me, I'll stand you a drink Are you really going to divorce your husband? As soon as we decided to separate he became more possessive I feel so sorry for him Because of me, he's had a hard time "Rooms by the hour" Not very subtle! You want to sleep with me? Sorry Let's forget about it Something... ...about the smell of your body... ...reminds me of someone I'm missing I don't know why When I'm in bed... ...I sometimes think of you But I don't think we should be doing this I'm leaving now Darling, today at work... Yes They paid me a bonus Let's use it for a vacation Guess where I'd like to go! - If you're right I'll go with you - New Zealand! You've told me before Wrong answer! You'll have to go alone How do you sleep? I need sleeping pills Why did you buy a new camera? Sunjoo is avoiding me So I'm trying to get better photos of her I know you think I'm stalking her But I know what I'm doing All I want is for Sunjoo to acknowledge me What I can't stand is... ...when she looks away from me That drives me crazy! Where were we? You told me... ...he left for New Zealand Then I have more lies to tell you Seokwon... We haven't known each other long But we've been good friends, haven't we? I hesitated... But... ...friends can't part without saying goodbye This is the last time I'll see you Smoking heavily, drinking heavily... Pregnant with his babies... Twins, born two months premature... After their cremations... ... buying two canaries Mixing ashes from my babies into their bird food Praying to heaven every night... ... that he should die I can't bear knowing... ... that he's still alive... ... under the same sky as me I wish... ... the untamed waves would... ... pound his body... I wish his blood were sprinkled over white snow... I pray and pray... Heaven grants my wish My dreadful curse brings his death I write like a madwoman to earn forgiveness But...
