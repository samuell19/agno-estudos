[GIRL SCREAMS] ['MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB' - TRADITIONAL PLAYS] [SOUND OF CRICKETS] [GIRL SCREAMS] [MOANING NOISES] [OFF SCREEN] Argh! Was that it? What? I tried! I don't know why you bother. I told you. Making me gag you is too much of a turn on. And I told you I didn't want to wake my sister! Just... ...give me a minute to restock. Forget it. My parents will be back soon anyway, you should probably go. You pissed at me? You going to Dawson's party on Halloween? You not going with Kelly? Nah, she's got a 'family thing'. Take that as a no? That's a no, Danny. Fine. I need to go to the bathroom. [SINISTER GIGGLE] [SINISTER LAUGH] [CLOWN LAUGHS] JESUS! What the hell are you doing? You'll wake Sally up! You dumb bastard. What? It's a decoration for the front lawn. Mom must've not stuck it out yet. Did he scare you? No, I just... It's just a doll, Danny. Ain't nothing to be scared of. Ah, it's just... ...my brother used to tell me about this guy. Went crazy one night. Killed his wife dressed as a clown. It was just a few towns over. You mean Carlton Layton. The Killer Clown. That happened miles away, never mind years ago. Why the hell would he be in our spare room? I know... ...maybe he came all this was to watch me fuck another girl's boyfriend. I think he's cute. [CLOWN LAUGHS] I... I better go. Danny, wait. I'm sorry for busting your balls. Call me tomorrow and I'll see if I can get out of babysitting for the party, ok? I'm gonna break up with her, you know? I'm just waiting for the right time. Yeah. I've heard that before. I'm serious. Go on. Call me tomorrow. Sally?

Where've you been? I've been trying to find you all afternoon. Yeah, I took a shift down at the coffee shop. The one place I didn't look. I thought you only worked weekends? Yeah, well. I need anything they have at the minute, so... Well, while you were slaving over shitty, overpriced coffee... ...you missed out on picking out costumes for tonight. Tonight? Mark Dawson's Halloween party? It's all I've talked about for a week! That's tonight. Yeah! So what'd you get? Well, it was slim pickings because we left it until the last minute, but you've got... Slutty witch. Or slutty devil. Choice is yours. Except I'm having the slutty devil on account of me being an evil bitch, so... Man, I thought we were going as cats or something. Carley, it's Halloween day... ...it was either these or those stupid screaming ghost things. I figured this would at least show off your ass a bit more. Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. I told you, you should've come with me. [KATIE] Carley? Is everything ok? I got this in the mail today. [CARLEY] I've been falling behind on my tuition... [CARLEY]... and now my rent... They wanna kick you out!? Yeah. And even with all the hours I been working I'm still gonna come up a couple hundred bucks short. Hey, relax, I'm sure I can lend you the cash. At least if I don't have to eat for the next month. That's ok. I can't accept favours from anyone. I got myself into this, I just have to get myself out. Where are you gonna find that kinda money? I don't know. It's not like money just... ...comes out of nowhere. [PHONE RINGS] [ANSWER PHONE MESSAGE] Hey! [ANSWERPHONE MESSAGE] This is Carley, and Katie. [ANSWERPHONE MESSAGE] If we don't answer, it's because we're out being awesome. [ANSWERPHONE MESSAGE] Call us back. If you wanna! [ANSWERPHONE BEEPS] [FROM PHONE] Hey Carley. [FROM PHONE] It's Mr. Palmer. [FROM PHONE] I hope you're ok. [FROM PHONE] Listen. [FROM PHONE] Francine and I know you're busy with college and everything, but... [FROM PHONE] ...well, we're in a bit of a pickle. [FROM PHONE] Our sitter hasn't turned up and.. [FROM PHONE] ...we were wondering, well.. [FROM PHONE] ...if you could maybe look after Mary Beth for us this evening? [FROM PHONE] I know it's short notice, and... [FROM PHONE] ...well, you've probably got plans, but... [FROM PHONE] ...I could make it worth your while. [FROM PHONE] Say, 200 dollars? [FROM PHONE] Call me back, anyway. [FROM PHONE] Usual number. Woah. Spooky. [SYNTH MUSIC PLAYS] Carley!? Oh my god! It's been years. You look so different! Yeah, it's been a while. It's nice to see you. Thanks for coming. HEY FRANK! CARLEY LEWIS IS HERE! Well, if it isn't little Carley Lewis. Not so little anymore are ya? Thanks for coming on such short notice, dear. We've had this booked for months and, well, without a sitter... It's no problem. Well don't just stand there, come on in! There's food and soda in the fridge... ...and if you need anything else I've left takeout menus in the drawer by the phone and... Candy in the cupboard under the stairs. I remember. It's nice to see you again, Carley. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] CARLEY! Here comes trouble now! Hey, kiddo! Wow! You look crazy grown up! I love your costume. She's obsessed! All she's done is talk about that costume for the last month! Well, I think it's very sweet. Hey, maybe if it's ok with your mom, we could take it out trick-or-treating? Can we? Now, we've talked about this, ain't we, Mary Beth? Is that not ok? We'd rather Mary Beth stayed in tonight after.. Francine! Would you mind taking Mary Beth into the other room? Come on, honey. What's going on? Is everything ok? Well, I guess you remember Sara Allen, right? Yeah, the cow stole my boyfriend in high school. She's not coming over tonight, is she? I should hope not. It turned out she was murdered the other night. And little Sally Allen. She was snatched from her bed. Oh my god! That's horrible! I'm surprised you haven't heard about it, it's been all over the news... ...and, well, it's just about the only thing everyone around here can be talking about. No, I've just been working round the clock lately. I don't think I've watched TV in about a month. Well, you understand why we'd rather you guys stayed in tonight, though, right? Yeah! Of course. Geez. Did they find who did it? Well, they reckon it was Danny Jackson... ...someone saw him leaving the house that night in a hurry and, well, he's not been seen since. Danny Jackson? Are you sure? I mean, the guy's an a-hole but I can't imagine he'd be able to even hurt a fly. Well, that's just what they're saying... ...I wouldn't even be going out tonight honestly if it wasn't for this damn promotion I been chasing. Talking of which, I guess we better get a move on. Francine? Francine? Are you ready yet? [EERIE MUSIC PLAYS] Now, here's where we'll be. If you need anything, just give us a call. Don't you worry about that. She'll be calling you up every ten minutes. And in bed by ten, you. And no scary movies. [ALL] Bye! Right. What do you wanna do? Watch scary movies! [ENGINE NOISE] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Yeah? It's 8. Do you need anything else from me before I clock off? You the only one still here? Hawkins and Henries are both out leading the search party. Harrison left about an hour ago. Any word on the girl's boyfriend? Danny Jackson? We spoke to a few people close to him, but no-one's seen him since the other night. Nah, you're free to go. You sure you don't need anything else from me, Sheriff? Nah, I've got it. You go and enjoy your Halloween. I think I'll pass. Suit yourself. Sir..? ...can I ask..? Is everything ok? I just don't know, Jody-Ann. I been looking over these missing girl cases... ...doesn't make the best late night reading, you know? I know. It's like that for a lot of us. It's not like we've seen a lot of stuff like this in Still Rivers before, you know? I mean... ...girls getting snatched up out of their beds... ...dead bodies... ...this ain't the kind of thing you come to a place like this for. Y'know, this is the kind of place you come to get away from a thing like that. I suppose the whole department knows about that, then. That you worked on the Layton case over in Carlisle? Some of us. Well, I thought I'd moved away to get away from all that. It's a small town, Sheriff. You can't keep a secret here for too long, you know? You did really well to keep it quiet for two years! Well, sometimes I feel like it might have followed me here. You don't think that Jackson did it? Jackson's a trouble maker, but I don't think he's a murderer. If it wasn't Jackson, then..? This whole town's in a panic. I'm doing the best I can to stop a frenzy. Until I get to the bottom of this, I... Do you mean..? On the record, I can't be sure. And off it? Without a doubt. [PHONE RINGS] Sheriff's office? Ah, hi Joyce. Yeah Ok, ok, Joyce. You just sit tight and I'll send somebody over to check it out. Alright, thank you. That was Joyce Beaumont. She said they ain't heard from the Baileys in a couple of days... ...and there's a funny smell coming from the house. I'm gonna go check it out. Do you wanna come with? Wouldn't miss it.

[CARLEY] Mary Beth? [CARLEY] Mary Beth? Mary Beth? Mary Beth! Carley! Look what I found! What are you doing out here? Someone knocked. They left this for me. What> Who? I think it was the man over there. [TV PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] Come on, let's get you inside. Do I have to go to sleep? It's way past your bedtime, little miss. But I'm not tired! Your mom said bed by ten. She'll be upset if she finds out I let you stay up this long. Will you be here in the morning? No, I have to go home tonight. But how about I come and see you at the weekend? I won't be here then. What do you mean? The man wants me to go away with him. What man? The man from outside. He wants me to go away with him. Well... ...I'm not going to let anyone take you anywhere, ok? Now, get some sleep, you. [MARY BETH] Carley? He was dressed like a clown. I like clowns. Goodnight. [CARLEY SIGHS] [ENGINE NOISE] What do you think? The house seems pretty quiet. Well, it wouldn't be first time Joyce Beaumont's jumped to some wild conclusion. You know... ...I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't have your number on speed dial by now. Well, it's best to be sure. What are you hoping to find? I'm hoping to find nothing. I'm hoping to find that there's a rational explanation for all this. That we find that little girl and Jackson. And that Sara Allen was just a tragic accident and we're just counting the days down to Christmas. But you don't think Jackson did it, do you? Nope. Layton? C'mon, Sheriff, you can't be serious. I mean... ...why would he be in Still Rivers? He's got unfinished business. What do you mean? I knew Layton. I was there the night it started. [SHERIFF HATCHER] You see... ...Layton was a family man. He got a bit down on his luck. Lost his job. So he started working as a kid's entertainer... Hey, darling, it's me. Look, I'm... ...I'm gonna have to stay late at the office again. [HANGS UP PHONE] [SHERIFF HATCHER] Pretty safe to say that he didn't do too good at that. [COUNTRY ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] Hey. Rough day, huh? How much time you got? Sales not going down too well? Something like that. Those bastards laid me off weeks ago. No severance or anything! Tough ride, man. Your wife must've been pissed. I never told her. Got another job to try and cover it up. Yeah? What job d'you get? A fucking clown. A clown? What like... kids parties? I can't imagine that pays too well. More than you'd think. Not enough for the shit I have to put up with. I can't imagine you as a clown! Are you kidding me? I'm the happiest fucking clown in the world. Everybody seemed to know about it except for Layton's wife. He did a pretty good job of keeping that a secret from her. [SHERIFF HATCHER] One night he came home... ...found out his wife had a little secret of her own. [ENGINE NOISE] [VAN DOOR SLAMS] [VAN DOOR OPENS] [FOOTSTEPS] [JOYFUL MOANING] What the fuck? [MOANING GETS LOUDER] Fuck. Fuck. FUCK! Fucking bitch. Fucking, fucking bitch. That bitch! [LAYTON BREATHES HEAVILY] [FOOTSTEPS] [JOYFUL MOANING] [AXE NOISE] Oh, Gary. You are a dirty boy. [SHE SCREAMS] Honey, I'm home! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] Oh, no! Looks like you got nailed twice tonight! Please. Please help me. My husband... ...he's gone mad. He's trying to kill me. It's 1152 West Brunswick. Please hurry! He's gonna... [SHE SCREAMS] Caroline? Let me come in! I just wanna 'axe' you something. Please. It was a mistake. It was an accident. I just needed some attention. I got a whole bunch of attention right here for you, darling. [LAYTON SHOUTS] Now. Is that any way to treat your loving husband? Please, Carlton. Now that's more like it. You always were a son of a bitch, Carlton. Darling? I want a divorce. [SLICING NOISE] [POLICE SIRENS] Jesus Christ! Hold it right there! [LAYTON LAUGHS] [LAYTON LAUGHS] Jesus, Sheriff, what happened to him? He just disappeared. I figured he just went on the run, maybe done himself in. About a year later... ...kids started going missing again in Carlisle. Families... ...siblings... babysitters. Anybody that got in the way. All butchered. Every time a kid went missing... ...the town was out for blood. Then I was made Sheriff after the old one up and quit. It was everything I could do to keep that department together, chasing after that bastard. Then one day, it just stopped. People never forgot. And I never forgot. And I felt it was time I had to leave. But you just said that... ...you thought he'd finished, so what... ...makes you think he's got anything to do with this missing girl? Every year... ...same thing's happened in a different town. And it's the same pattern. I thought he'd stopped, but he hadn't. He'd just moved on. After last night... ...I pulled up all the files and started looking for a pattern. Every time a little girl goes missing and somebody gets butchered. Were any of them ever found? Well, what else did the reports tell you? He's coming this way. [TV PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND] [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] Who's there? I can't believe I just said that. [WIND HOWLS] [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE RINGS] Hello? [MRS PALMER] Hey Carley, it's me. Is everything ok? Hi! Yeah, everything's fine. Mary Beth's all tucked up and I'm just about to sit down and watch some TV. [MRS PALMER] OK, honey. We'll be back around one. [MRS PALMER] I hope that's not too late? No, no. That's fine. Enjoy your party. [MRS PALMER] You too, see you soon. [MRS PALMER] Bye. [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] [THEY SHRIEK] Geez! Chill out, Mary Poppins, what the hell are you doing!? Katie. What are you doing here? Trick or treat? [KATIE] So... You been attacking all the trick or treaters tonight? No. I guess I've just been a little tricked out this evening. Someone keeps knocking at the door. Anyway. Aren't you supposed to be at Mark Dawson's party? Nah. The whole thing was a sausage fest. I figured I'd drop by to see if you needed a ride back. She just called. They won't be back 'til one. Bummer. Still... ...this is a nice place. Yeah. It's just kinda odd being back here after all this time. I spent so much time here as a kid. The Palmers were the best foster parents I ever had. Wait, these guys fostered you? I thought you lived in an orphanage? I did for a while but it was only temporary. They took me in. Let me know what it was like to have a real family for a while. Could you not have borrowed your tuition money from them? No way! One of the greatest lessons the Palmers ever taught me was to learn to stand on my own two feet. Busy night? Huh! I'm all candied out. Hey! Did you hear about what happened to the Allens? That's only a few streets over, right? Mr Palmer said he didn't want me taking Mary Beth out. They think it was Danny Jackson. Jackson!? No way! I heard a guy at the party say they found Sara Allen dead. I mean, she was a bitch but she didn't deserve that! And her little sister Sally snatched right out of her bed. Did they find Danny? Still missing according to the news. The guys at the party, they said they found her strung up... ...dressed up like a clown, her face carved up. Bullshit. Probably. You know how these frat boys like making shit like this up to scare chicks into bed. Does that even work? Like, one time! [THEY BOTH LAUGH] [DOOR LOCK RATTLES] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] You learn that at the Academy? Something like that. Don't look like anybody's home. They could've gone away for the weekend and not told anybody about it. You think so? With neighbours like Joyce Beaumont, the town feels safe. Gets in everybody's business... ...reports everything she sees and it usually winds up being nothing... ...just the way I like it. Sheriff, you smell that? Yeah, it's coming from over there. OK, so... ...what if we don't find anybody. I mean, just because there's nobody here doesn't mean that something bad's happened to them. He'll leave a calling card. What kind of a calling card? Sheriff's Department. Come out with your hands up. [HOWELLS THROWS UP] Fuck. It's him. Sure you don't want me to swing back later? I'll be alright. Mr Palmer said he'd give me a right home. Suit yourself. See you back at the dorms, then. Oh, and watch out for creepy clowns! Bye. [CREAKING NOISE] [TRAFFIC NOISE] [ON RADIO] I'm just saying, the police could be doing more to find this kid. [ON RADIO] I gotta ask, Dave, are the police really doing enough? [ON RADIO] Well, you gotta remember, Hank, we're living in a small town... [ON RADIO] Yeah. [ON RADIO] You know, they're understaffed, they're overworked. [ON RADIO] I've heard it all before! [CLEAVER LAUGHS] [ON RADIO] You know, any time somebody dies... [ON RADIO] The police run in the opposite direction. Are they at the doughnut store? [ON RADIO] Are they getting coffee? What is it? [ON RADIO] I mean, this is Still Rivers, we don't see things like this very often, you know? [ON RADIO] We're not prepared for this kinda thing! [ON RADIO] This is exactly what we should be prepared for. [ON RADIO] This is exactly where this kind of stuff happens. [ON RADIO] You know that. You've seen the movies. [ON RADIO] Currently, these guys are just out there, they're looking for this Jackson kid... [ON RADIO] They're doing their very best... [RADIO CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [POLICE SIRENS] How you feeling? Not great. I mean... ...how can someone do something like that? I don't know. I lost too many nights thing about that, Deputy. You don't think Jackson did this. Well, if he did... ...he went to a lot of effort to make it look like Layton. Sheriff, there's no sign of the girls but we found Danny Jackson. You think you could be wrong, Sheriff? Maybe... ...I was so sure. We'll just have to talk to Jackson. I'm afraid you might find that a mite difficult, Sheriff. [POLICE SIRENS] One of the kids from the party down the street... ...was trying to get lucky back here. Found him shoved in there like that... ...I guess it means lover boy weren't our man, right? Want me to call the others in the search party, get them down here? Sheriff? Give us a minute, Deputy. Sheriff, with all due respect, what the hell are you doing? If people get wind of this, we'll have more than a serial killer on our hands... ...we'll have pandemonium. I've seen it before. So, what do you think we should do? I mean, this... ...this asshole is more than likely gonna kill again, and we... ...we're just standing around here doing a whole buttload of nothing. We find him ourselves. We comb the streets until we find something. Are you insane!? I mean, that is like looking for a needle in a haystack in this town. It's either that or we have a lynch mob on our hands. We have got no idea where he's gonna go next. I mean, there is no pattern between any of these killings. There's just... there's a little girl... ...but none of them are even remotely related. What is it? I know how to find him. [TV PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] [CARLEY] Katie? You forgot your... Katie? [PHONE RINGS] Hello? [MRS PALMER] Hey, Carley. Just checking it to make sure everything's ok? Yeah, it's fine. Why? [MRS PALMER] Someone here said the police found some bodies a few streets over. [MRS PALMER] Another girl is missing! I don't know, I didn't hear anything! [MRS PALMER] We're gonna head back. [MRS PALMER] We should be with you in 45 minutes. [MRS PALMER] Just make sure you keep everything locked up 'til we get there. Did they find who did it? [MRS PALMER] Just hang tight. We'll be back shortly. OK, no problem. [ON TV] ...the local Halloween festivities, police have yet to confirm what they intend to do... [ON TV] ...about the abduction of 9 year old Jennifer Bailey... [ON TV] ...and the deaths of her parents, Stephanie and Peter Bailey, here in Still Rivers... [ON TV] ...although they are believed to have been deceased since last night. [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] [TV CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Who's there? Whoever you are, I'm calling the cops. [TV PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND] Shit! Are you kidding me!? What else could go wrong!? Oh, fuck you! What the fuck is going on? Mary Beth? Mary Beth, is that you? Mary Beth? [FLOORBOARDS CREAK] [CARLEY GASPS] [CLEAVER LAUGHS] TRICK OR TREAT! [CLEAVER LAUGHS] [HOWELLS] Sheriff, what are you doing!? Sheriff? We've missed something. I can't believe we didn't see this. I mean, shouldn't we be out there trying to catch this guy? He's already killed twice in two days! The Baileys. Their daughter is adopted, right? Yeah. Oh, god, wait so is Sally Allen. You don't think..? That they're all adopted? Every one of them? But why? Why specifically adopted kids? I need you to get every adoption record for the last five years. Can you do that for me? Yeah, they'll be on the computer but, I don't get it. Why? There was someone else there the night Layton murdered his wife. Yeah, the gardener. The guy she was sleeping with. [HATCHER] No. Then who? I went over the report, there was no mention of anybody else. I know! We buried it. We never thought it would come back. Sheriff, I don't understand..? We were only trying to protect her. Who? There was a little girl. She was only six. And she saw everything, Hold it right there! Don't worry, little lamb. I'll come back for you. [CLEAVER LAUGHS] [HOWELLS] You mean? His daughter. [CLEAVER] GOING SOMEWHERE, LITTLE MISSY? THE PARTY'S JUST GETTING STARTED. [CLEAVER LAUGHS] [LAUGHING STOPS] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] GOING SOMEWHERE, DARLING? Hope you enjoyed the trip. You're a pretty little thing aren't you? Shame to carve you all up really! [CARLEY] Please! What do you want? I want my little lamb back! Mary Beth! Don't you call her that! That's not her name. That's what you dirty fucking pigs call her. Oh my god! She's... My darling... My little Suzy... My little... Your daughter! Fuck you, clown! Mary Beth!

Are we going home now? Can we take Carley with us? [CLEAVER] She's resting, Suzy. [CLEAVER] Don't worry... [CLEAVER] ...there'll be plenty of time to make some new friends.
