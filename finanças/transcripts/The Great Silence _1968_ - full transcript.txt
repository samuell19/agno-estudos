I surrender. Don't kill me, Silence. I won't do it again. I'm through with bounty hunting. I swear. Damn you. You crippled my hands. Come on. It's safe now. You all afraid of these confounded bounty killers even if they're dead? Silence, you got here just in time. Take this. You earned it. You know we have to come down for food and they're always laying for us in the valley. They know we can't last long in this weather without supplies. Still, if we fought for our rights they'd raise the price on our heads and we'd be massacred. You could at least thank me for my trouble. Didn't you see he was about to shoot? All you did was waste a good shot. Why, that fella there had both his thumbs shot off. He never would've fired another pistol as long as he lived. That's why Silence didn't wanna shoot him. Because when he shoots anyone, it's always in self-defense. He knew they were waiting, but as always he's faster on the draw. But why should others protect us? We've all been in the army, so let's fight back. Let's fight those bounty killers once and for all. I'll be damned if I'm freezing to death up here. He's right. Now, listen here. Many of us are not guilty. The price on our heads will disappear soon. The new governor promised general pardons. We have to endure till then. I can't take it no more. I'm going back. I'd rather be taken alive. So, I'll turn myself in. It's better. At least prison is warm. Hey, wait. I'm coming, too. I'm leaving too. I reckon they'll be in jail when the pardons come. If they ever get there. THE GREAT SILENCE My boy. Where's that lawyer, Mama? He's here. I couldn't stand it anymore. I didn't say nothin' to the other fellas, but I decided to follow your advice. You're wise to put your trust in the law. God bless you for being here. Mama! My Son! I'm sorry, but it's our bread and butter. Well, I'll take him to the sheriff. Lucky I didn't hit this critter in the face, else they couldn't tell who he is. You comin' with me to collect, Loco? Nah, the reward's all yours, Charlie. I only came along in case you needed help. I'm going after the other two. There's plenty for all. Well, you watch yourself. I hear they got five of us the other day. This murder for rewards has to stop. We must stop these bounty killers. Well, Governor, thanks for the offer, but, uh... - You can't do it? - Well, bounty killers... You see, I figure, I figure the area is a little too large, it'll be damn difficult for one sheriff, sir... I'm sure it'll be easy for you, Sheriff. I know you'll handle it. You were a good soldier before this. I appreciate the offer, sir... I really appreciate it. Again. You can keep doing that. I only care about voters who want legitimate legality. The Old West is finished. Gunmen, bounty killers, bandits and sheriffs will belong to the same world. A better world where... Where a politician would give amnesty to the murderer of his own father to win an election. Do you infer that I do, Sheriff? What do you mean, sir? Nothin', excuse me, Governor. I was just thinkin' out loud. Thinking is not what a soldier does. Yes, Governor. No thinking, only rules. Now get out there and do your job. Yes, sir. Now, then, here's where you'll go. Snow Hill, Utah. Stop! Stop! I swear, Loco. I don't know. Tell me where he is, and I'll let you go. Oh, I don't know. You know all right, he was with you in the mountains. I don't know where he went to. I swear, I don't. Let me go. I swear to God, Loco. I don't know nothin'. I don't know nothin'. Why don't you tell me? Tell me now. Or don't you wanna live? In the mill... At the edge of town. Near... Near his wife's house. I think he's got a gun there. Thank you. I am the resurrection and the life, and whosoever believeth in me shall never die. Amen. If you're waiting for the stage, sir, I'm afraid it'll be a long time. It's been snowin' heavy up here and it's sure to be late. Would you like for me to fix up somethin' hot for ya while you wait? Thank you, sir. I won't be a minute. I know who you are, stranger. You're the one who helps those who fight for their rights. You avenge injustice and defend the innocent. My son was innocent, too. They took advantage of me and shot him dead. Like so many. Please, avenge him. Don't say no. One killer fled but the other's still in town. All I've got to give you is my son's horse for the death of that murderer. Please kill him. Do what I implore of you. Maybe others can be saved from death. Yeah, I know. I hear us tell that some would get... Rewards of up to $5,000. Now, you take my friend Loco, for example. Now, he gets a lot of money, but with this snow... Hard as hell, I'd say. I keep eating and eating, and still, I'm always cold. And your doctor says it's 'cause my blood's thin. And he wanted to do a blood test. Now, I said, "Don't touch my blood. "You ain't classifying me." You're right, Charlie. Blood never should be treated that way. You're right. Man, shut that door. Shut that door, I said. Shut it or I'll make you feel cold as dead. You hear me? I'll kill you if you don't. Calm down, Charlie. Bullying could be damn dangerous for you. I don't bully, Sheriff. I shoot. Now, shut that damn door. So, shall I arrest him? No, Charlie provoked him and drew first. The other shot him in self-defense. It's a pretty good way to kill someone. The law can do nothin' about it. Charlie was pretty fast with a gun. But this one's faster than the devil. For all I know, he is the devil. You're wasting your time. My husband's not here. I know, but I'm not gonna risk losing $1,000. And you can make him come to me. And you will, won't you? Oh, no, I won't. Now, get out. Don't you sass me. If you care about your wife, come out! Go. I want you alive. No matter if dead or alive, I still get a reward. What do you fear? Come on now, give up. Throw down that rifle and come out with your hands up. Now say goodbye to your husband. And cover him with snow. He'll be perfect under this cold. He can be buried only once I collect his bounty. So don't you bury him, you hear? Ah, for Pete's sake. What times we live in. When a nigger's worth more than a white man. Help me! They shot my husband. Please, help me. Boss, look there. Another one. Oh, Pauline! Oh, good lord. Oh, you poor child. - Be strong. - Don't cry. Pollicut! You dirty usurer. You have a good life, don't you? While this poor guy lies cold and dead, all because of you! It's you, bloodsucker, who gets the law to put prices on folks' heads so you can profit! That man was a criminal and he got what he deserves. If Pauline is in dire straits, I'll supply anything she wants. Button your pants, you dirty old goat. Better to sleep in a doghouse than with you. Yeah, come on. Hey! Come on, Betsy. Oh, there! Come on now, steady. Oh, come on, Betsy. Now, fall in. March. Move, you stupid beast. Come on. I am the sheriff. I haven't got money. No dinero. You'll be hanged if you kill me. The first that tries gets killed. Halt, or I'll shoot. A frozen gun ain't gonna stop us, Sheriff. Up here, we learn by experience to keep our guns good and warm. And we can use 'em. What're you gonna do about it? The first one of you takes a step loses his head. Don't you worry. We don't want to kill you. Then what do you want? We just want that horse of yours. You want my horse? There's an awful lot of you. What're you gonna do with just one horse, anyhow? Eat it. We're gonna feed off that beast for at least a week. - You can stay at my place. - It's no use. I only want one thing... Revenge! Even if I risk my life. What can you do, honey, it's Pollicut's fault. Because he wouldn't give your husband any work and forced him to rob. He is responsible. Maybe so. But the real assassin is Loco. I want him dead. I want his life. In return for my husband's. There's a man that makes bounty killers tremble. They call him Silence. Because wherever he goes, the silence of death follows. Yeah, we're only a week late. Hey! Stop! - Hey! - Look there! I'm Sheriff Gideon Burnett. I lost my horse. Been walkin' for miles, but I froze. Gotta get to Snow Hill. - That's where we're headed. - I don't care where you're headed. Gotta get to Snow Hill. Now! I said right now! Sorry for going off-road, but I need to go to Snow Hill. Urgently. I'm the new sheriff. Getting robbed wasn't enough, now this cold too... Well, I guess... Here, you're wondering how come I lost my horse. Poor old Betsy. The bandits stole my horse to eat it. Unhitch those horses and hurry up. We don't get outta here soon, we'll be snowbound for good. Would you mind helping me, and we'll put 'em on top of the stage? I'll take the biggest. You're heavy... Steady, boy. Haul him up. Hey, you! That's no way to transport the dead. It's against regulations. I'm Gideon Burnett, the new sheriff of Snow Hill. Yes, I saw the star. You do look like a pig breeder, but with that on, you look more like a pig breeder who plays the sheriff. Who's that wannabe funny guy wearing a priest hat and a woman's fur? Loco. Better to lose him than find him. - Thanks a lot. - Don't mention it. Hold on, mister. It's my duty to tell you that the dead should be transported only in coffins of wood or metal as specified in Article 15 of the Burial Code. No, these aren't ordinary corpses, Sheriff. No? What are they? What's so special about 'em? Well, they're bandits. There's a price on their heads. You see, I'm takin' them in the best way one can in weather like this. Sorry, may I? Hey, which are they? According to these posters, there oughta be four. Who are the two on top? The second and the third. There's another one waitin' to be buried soon as I've been paid. You know what it says here? "Dead or alive." I'll lay a bet you never take 'em alive. Those are dangerous men, Sheriff. That's why there's this other case in the law. And it'd be too dangerous. They're against God, humanity, moral and public order. Killing them is a good thing, believe me. Hey, pull up here. What's the matter? I got another piece of freight to collect. Give me a hand, I can't do it on my own. What is he doing now? Here's the other one. That's it, grab his arms. I left him here two days ago. Figured the snow'd keep him fresh. He's only worth $500, but better than nothing. What's wrong, Sheriff? Money is money. And I'm getting old, too. I don't think you're gonna get old. Sooner or later, you're gonna meet up with someone faster than you. Well, that'll be an amusing day. Mighty! Hey, girls, the stage is here. Whoa, now! Well, so long, friend. I hope you'll be a little bit more talkative next time. Here's your saddle. Snow Hill's a little place, ain't it? I had an idea it was bigger. And if it keeps on snowin' like this it'll be even littler. I want that man followed. Tell me where he's spendin' the night. Very well, boss. Listen, mister, you're not leavin' your freight in the street. Bury him or else take him home and lay him out, see? Well, if you pay me right away, you can have them, Sheriff. Is that so? Well, that's all I need. I suppose you think I'm the grave digger around here? Listen, I don't like your face or your manners. So watch out, or you'll be down there with them. See? Good evening, Sheriff. Welcome to Snow Hill. I'm glad to see that we have a sheriff who knows how to command respect. Thanks. Who are you? I thought you would've guessed. I'm Henry Pollicut. And that's my store over there. That's very peculiar. When you were sent here, nobody mentioned me? Nobody bothered. Why? You somebody important or something? What do you do, beside trading? Actually, I'm the Justice of the Peace in Snow Hill. We'll be working together. Well, are you gonna pay me now, Sheriff? I would really like to get out of this snow. You'll get paid in due time. Come to my office tomorrow. Now, get your goods off the street. Yes. I sent it to you. Come in, please. I thought you'd be older. But, of course, it's not important. Please, sit down. I asked you to come to kill a man for me. How much you want for him? You could at least answer me. Well, can't you talk? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I couldn't even imagine. Tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow, I'll pay you. I need a little time to raise it. Loco is the man that you want. You'll know him, he came in to town on the same stage as you. He killed my husband. He did it for $1,000, too. No, if you want me to kill him, put a good price on his head. You oughta do this for nothin'. It's in your own interest, Loco. He's an enemy of bounty killers. I know him. He thinks he can fix the world with a gun. He has his method. He's the second to pull it out but the first to shoot. Sooner or later he'll die. But you're the man he's here to get. He's paid by Pauline. He'll pick a fight with you. I can control my temper. He won't shoot off my thumbs. And he ain't gonna kill me in self-defense either. Maybe he doesn't like you. And come on, now you can sleep with Pauline. There's no other husband, what else do you want? If you want people shot, ask your servant. Or one of my colleagues. They're coming tomorrow. You better sleep here. It's better they don't see you around. There's a bed upstairs. Goodnight. No, dear. You can't. You better surrender. Gordon, get out. I'm the sheriff! There's no sense resisting. Better let a lawyer prove you're innocent. I'll answer for your safety before you come to trial. Now, act sensible. It's safer for you if you're put in prison. But if you're not, some bounty hunter will kill you for the reward. Okay, Sheriff, I'm surrendering. Dad! The kid, will he talk? He'll never talk again. The dead on one side The money on the other. That's it. You see, Sheriff, since our friend here has to have, uh, irrefutable proof of identity, as the law requires. He, uh, shows the bodies and the reward posters when he collects. It's all quite correct. Correct, huh? But, uh, what's your interest in this? You're just a banker, and all you gotta do is advance me the money to pay off this man. Oh, true. Of course. But aside from my small percentage all cash is required to change hands in my presence. To make sure the bounty killer has been honest. The law is quite precise, Sheriff. In this town, as in the whole United States, the law is the important thing. Am I right? All right, pay him off and get rid of the corpses. They smell. One, two, three, four... Well, now, you earned two rewards of $500 each and... Two of $1,000 each. That makes $3,000. Officially paid. There's only three out there, and you're paying him for four. How come? Where's the fourth body? The nigger makes four. Four? How you figure that? It's not my fault, Sheriff, I left him on ice, but the man's wife, Pauline, buried the corpse. Everybody knows it. Yes, that's the truth. It's quite correct. Yeah, maybe yes, and maybe no. But, as of now, I just don't hardly see how any of this figures. So, I have to investigate. I'm confiscating the money. First, I'm gonna question the widow, and exhume the dead body. Then, I'm gonna file a report who in turn'll pass it on to the proper Department of State. Just like you gentlemen said, everything according to the law. Cold, ain't it? I reckon I'd head for a better climate if I was you. More like Africa. I meant no offense, Pauline. No offense. Pauline? A pleasure to see you. Is there something you want to buy? I didn't come to buy. I came to sell. And what're you selling? Our house. It cost at least $5,000. I'll give it to you for $1,000. 'Cause you like cheap things. Well, come in. - Mind the store, Martin. - Yes, boss. May I ask what you need this for? It's a pretty good sum. No. I shouldn't have brought it up. Just the same. Is this to pay a man for a certain crime? That's my business. Just tell me, are you interested in my offer? Not really. You know, you shouldn't crawl for money like this. I wouldn't take advantage of your situation for $1,000. I want you to have it. I wish it were poison. Not bad, friend. But it could be better. What do you think, uh? Oh, yeah. I heard about that gun of yours. Some kind of mechanical gun. Not very accurate. Good shot. Too good. I'd sure like to know what a man who can shoot like you is doing around here. You ain't by some chance one of them no-good bounty hunters, are you? I asked you a question, so answer... Well, where do you come from? How long you intend to stay? If you think you're being smart, now then, stranger, let's have it. He can't answer, Sheriff. He's a mute. Well, I'll be... At least you could've told me. I mean... You could've let me know, you know what I mean. Ma'am. I came on account of an investigation. They say that you... Buried your husband. I mean, after he got himself shot by a bounty killer. So... ls that true? Yes, it is. What was his name? James Middleton. No, I mean the bounty killer. Loco. I'll raise you. I'm out. I'll call you. I want to get even. What do you say, we double it? No wonder it's freezing, the fire ain't burning. It's your money. You ain't getting rich off me. He's gonna cover us cause you said we was gonna get rich here in this tank town. So far, we ain't seen hide nor hair of a single bandit. Calm down, Oliver. They'll come out of the mountains when they're hungry enough. We just have to bring them out of the woods. Hello there! Hi. - Need a match? - Oh, thanks. Hello, Sheriff. May I present my friends. I prefer you don't... If they're friends of yours. There's your money. Oh, how nice of you to come out of your way, Sheriff. I would've come for it. I'm not nice at all. I just want to get you the hell out of town. I don't intend to leave Snow Hill. It's good for me, I like the view. I even like you, Sheriff. He's not a bad sheriff at all. I knew this fella once, from Cindrel Rock. He was second cousin to a friend of mine, who used to be in my troop. He was a joker like you. Whiskey! I didn't get the money. But I still want my revenge. I don't want you to work for nothing. There is one who'd give me the money, right away. If I wanted to... Do what he wants. Well... What he wants in exchange is too high a price for me to pay. But I'm willing to pay you. Now, before... After, whenever. Check. He used to complain about the cold. So one day, I decided to do that boy a favor. And I made him a nice overcoat out of wood. It cured him of sneezin'. I reckon I won't forget him if I live to be 50. The fellas and me are wonderin' what possessed you to tell that story. Well, if one of you gentlemen feels a sneeze coming on, best let her fly outside of town. Won't you offer me a beer? I don't know, if I have to stay here any more I'll bust. Then come for a walk with me, it'll do you good. I open for $50. I'll stay. Well now, I'll just make it $75. Yeah? How about $100? I'll go along with that. Me, too. I'm in. All right, how many cards, boys? One here. Three. I pass. Two cards. I bet $100. $200. I'll see that. I'll raise it another $100. I fold. Same here, ain't cent baggin' me. 500 dollars. Say, boy, you're trying to force me to draw, ain't you? I know your system. And I know you're methods. But, I'm not losing my temper, of that I'm sure. If anybody draws first, it's gotta be you. You must not rely on me. Jack? I reckon I better not wear a gun. Come on, take off my belt. And now, boy... I've been waitin' a long time for an amusin' day like this. Are you hurt? I'm sorry. You ain't supposed to go shooting men in the back. You're under arrest. You can't hold me here. I reckon I can. If I pay my bail? In that case, mister, it'll be $100. My money's all on the table in the saloon. And the $3,000 you gave me as well. You can't use that money, it's been confiscated. Oh, come on, Sheriff. Give me my money. There's $1,000 for you. Glad to hear it, mister. That's attempted bribery. Now your bail is up to $5,000. You hate me because I kill bandits. But you do the same thing, 'cause you give 'em to the hangman. That's different. The law has a right to kill. Why? Because when the law kills, it's not murder, it's punishment. The death of a bandit must serve as an example to other people who'll not do... - Go on killing. - Shut up! Sheriff, I reckoned I should bring you these things of Loco's. And all this cash that those fellows left layin' around in the saloon. Thank you. That was real thoughtful of you, Regina. Would you like some coffee? Thanks. But I'll do it. A hardworkin' man like you should be served by a lady like me. Thanks. Pretty good coffee. But it tastes a lot nicer, if you'd come on over and pour it for me. That's a big request, Sheriff. She waits on the whole West Territory of the U.♪. and Mexico. I'll teach you to talk to a lady like that! Oh, I'm so sorry. I hope you didn't hurt yourself. Sheriff, you're officially to release Loco from this jail. Why should I release him? I ask for the citizens of Snow Hill, represented by these gentlemen right here. Will they go as bail? I'll post it for him. And why are you so interested in this gentleman's liberty? There's a community of outlaws in the mountains here engaged in crime. They live by robbery. You've heard of them. Until such time as an amnesty is given these renegades, bounty killers are our one defense against them. I protect you from outlaws, Mr. Pollicut. Nah. It'll be worse. One man who was killed was called Sanchez. His brother is a big, bad man from Nevada. He'll put a hole through your badge, if he don't get revenge. And I'm afraid, Sheriff, that if you don't release Loco immediately, other bounty hunters will be comin' to get him out of jail. That wouldn't be good. Reckon that's possible. That's just why they pay me. To keep order. Now them bandits you're all so scared of are nothin' but a bunch of hungry rags. If you folks put some provisions out at the edge of town, they won't bother you any more. As for this skunk's friends, if there are any still around, they're gonna have to break him out of the Tonopah Jail because that's where I'm taking him. Boss! The sheriff's aiming to leave town with Loco and a bunch of them mountain critters have been seen headed this way. Now, this hero says that the dead man's brother and his friends are coming. But if you ask me, he's talking through his hat. If they show up here, they won't find him and they won't bother anybody. And what about the bandits? They know Loco's leaving so they'll be comin' down off the mountains. Now you're talking through your hat. Do what I told you, and nothin' will happen. Set a wagon outside of town, and put as much food on it as you can spare. If they eat, they'll behave. And you women, all of you stay inside. Understand? Let's get movin'. Fill a wagon? So now these bandits gotta be fought with bread and butter? When are we gonna see some law and common sense in this town? When somebody hangs you. Well, Martin, will he come out of it? Alive? I doubt it. When he left, he was leaking blood all over the sidewalk. Let's hope that he lost it all. - Where is he? - He's at the girl's house. Not easy to follow us in all this snow. Now, what if your mute friend should decide to come after me and shoot me in the back? He's wounded and can't move. Besides, he don't kill like that. Yeah, well, I'm not so sure. For me, one way is good as another. As long as it takes me to Tonopah and you to jail. Hey, watch out. It's them outlaws. Let me out of these handcuffs, quick. They'll stay where they are. They're not gonna kill anybody who can't shoot. Come on, smile. Lousy bounty killer. I learn by experience, too. And now my gun works. Listen to me, friends, be patient. There'll be an amnesty soon. And you can all go home. So, best leave Loco to the law. I guarantee you, there's food for all of you at Snow Hill, so go there and feed yourselves. But take my advice. In future, go easy on the horse meat. It's not all as tender as mine. Where do we find it? Right outside of town. They're worse than animals. Trap 'em with an ambush when they get to Snow Hill. Or we could both go there and round them up and split the bounty. They're small fry, but not when you add them all up. I never did like to hit a man when his hands are tied, but if you make me sick enough, I'm gonna have to. Well, when I owe a man for a favor he's done me, I wanna do a favor in return. Honest. One more word, and you're gonna be tried and executed. My husband was a good man. They forced him to steal, to give me a decent life. Because Pollicut could put a price on his head. He thought, if I became his mistress... Well, he thought wrong. Pauline? We're collectin' food for those poor folk who've been hidin' up in the mountains. There never were bandits. What'd ya got to offer? I'll go see. Well, take your time, but see what you can spare. Take it easy, folks. Don't crowd, there's plenty more. - There you are, ma'am. - That's right. Now, we'll start with the potatoes. Wanna clean out the store? Yeah, comin' up. Here. Won't be long before you and your kind are finished. Are you gonna abolish rewards, Sheriff? We're gonna abolish crime. We're buildin' a great country, and we're fightin' to make sure justice governs it. And not leeches like you. You really believe that, Sheriff? That's right, mister. You know, if I wasn't handcuffed, I'd applaud. I'll applaud when you're hanged. Mind if we stop, Sheriff? What for? I have to take a dump. I can't if I'm tied. Oh, all right. Go ahead. Thanks, Sheriff. Don't take all day. I couldn't stand it anymore. We got a long way to ride yet. So, go on. I said, hurry up, Loco. I won't be long. We're already behind time. I wanna get across this ice before dark. I'll help you to get across all right, Sheriff. All right now, I'm finished, Sheriff. Loco, now listen. Killing a sheriff will cost you plenty. If I were you, I'd think it over. I don't need to. You're on the side of the law. We? We're on the side of the law of survival. Survival of the fittest. Calm down, friends. Since when are wolves afraid of wolves? Never, Loco. Who chained you? Nice fella. Sheriff. Gimme a hand. Ah, Sheriff Burnett. The one on Snow Hill. I wouldn't have thought he'd bother anyone. He won't bother anyone no more. Why, he ain't gonna show up before the spring thaw. I helped him take a little swim in the river. But he went under. He may never come up again. Now, in Snow Hill... We can't miss a couple of opportunities. First, the outlaws in the mountains are heading there. There's a modest price on their heads. Still, it's a powerful lot, when you add 'em all together. And it's nice and legal, too. But then we have this other one. The mute who shoots thumbs off. The one who hates bounty killers. Since you murdered Sheriff Burnett, I don't go for that. But it was the mute who killed your brother. The hell you say? He had no chance to defend himself. Come on. Let me go. Look at my hand, remember what you did. You're crippled just to spite the men you hate. So nobody'll be able to use a gun against you. Maybe you ruined my hand, but for what I've come here to get, it won't matter much. Help! Loco and all his men are headin' this way. They'll get you and Silence. You have to go, right away. Go find a place that's safer. If they find him, they'll kill ya. But he's hurt. Regina, help me. We gotta hide him. Loco! The mute killed Pollicut. He's at the nigger girl's house. Go get him, kill him. Get even. If you come here, Loco, you'll find out I can shoot a pistol too. Oh, come on, drop that, Regina. You're wasting your breath on us. If I kill you, I'll be glad, you hear? You saw that woman shoot first. Find that mute, he couldn't have gotten far. Look sharp, he's gotta be someplace. Find anything? Ain't no one in the hayloft, Joe. We searched high and low, but he ain't there. We'll find him sooner or later. The outlaws! I just saw the outlaws! The fields are full of outlaws. Come on, he can wait. I'll go. You be still, I'll drive 'em off. You stay quiet. There's no one around. And the food's there, like the sheriff said. Come on! Don't shoot. Gotta take them first if we want the mute. Throw down your guns. We got you surrounded. Surrender or we'll kill you all. Hurry 'em up! Herd 'em in to the saloon. Stay down. I want the mute to come shoot it out with me. Just him and me. And tell him if he don't... I'm gonna shoot every one of these people here. My friends won't interfere. So, it's my life against every one of theirs. Go fetch him, you know where he is. There wasn't time. I'm sorry. I tried, but Loco had captured 'em. He's taken 'em all as hostages in the saloon. He wants to shoot it out with you. Just you and him. He said to tell you if you don't, he'll kill every one of 'em. But you can't, Silence. You're hurt real bad. Besides, I'm certain it's a trap. You can't trust him. Don't get involved. Please, don't go. Let's run for it. There must be some place we can go. They're gonna kill 'em either way. They're all gonna die. What's the use of waitin'? Let's get it over with. Murder us all. And you'll burn in hell forever. Come on, kill us all! He's out front. You devil! No! God, pity us. There's a bounty on each one. We'll come back and collect 'em later. All according to the law. The massacres of 1898, finally brought forth public condemnation of the bounty killers, who under the false guise of legality, made violent murder a way of life. For many years, there was a sign at Snow Hill which carried this legend: "MEN'S BOOTS CAN KICK UP THE DUST OF THIS PLACE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, BUT NOTHING MAN CAN EVER DO WILL WIPE OUT THE BLOOD STAINS OF THE POOR FOLK WHO FELL HERE."
