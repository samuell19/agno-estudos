PARTNERS: THE MOVIE Yutaka Mizutani Yasufumi Terawaki Directed by Seiji Izumi My God, this is really cruel. I've seen him somewhere. It's Takaomi Nakajima. He was the newscaster of News Express. He quit last year. You don't watch the news. Cause of death? Strangulation. Judging from abrasions on his neck, he was strangled from behind. How was he hung so high? We found an electric winch. With a pulley, one person can easily pull him that high. Hung him that high with this. LOWER HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES' HALL Hinako KATAYAMA Lower House Rep. Good morning. Oh, my. Melons. From your support group. Share them among you. Rep., please confirm your schedule for today. To the airport after the committee. METROPOLITAN POLICE SPECIAL TASK SECTION According to the police, Mr. Nakajima was strangled. Active from the morning? Yes, the victim was Takaomi Nakajima. Hanging the body from the tower is truly perverted. Yes, it is quite a puzzling case. Mr. Nakajima's agent stated no one had seen Mr. Nakajima after he left the office at 10 p.m. The police will try to determine his whereabouts after that time and the source of the electric winch. Not busy? Good morning. It's still morning. Oh, the Tama Tower Murder... Watching this major case on TV? You're not busy as usual. You know they won't let us join the investigation. - Special Task. - It's our phone. It's the Chief Inspector. I'm Muneta Police Agency Security Bureau. A package bomb arrived at Rep. Katayama's office. A secretary who opened it, had minor injuries. The CSI says small amount of gun powder was used. It wasn't lethal, and was probably meant to be a warning to her. Left-wing radicals, Red Canary sent threat letters to her office and others around her. They must be responsible for the bomb. Radicals? Must be related to that Bill. Sugishita! Hold your tongue. Katayama is a member of Heisei Future Group. Transmission Monitoring Amendment is expected to be effective on left-wing radicals. Red Canary aims to block the Bill. The problem is: Rep. Katayama is scheduled to fly to attend Ecology Expo now held in Kuala Lumpur. And what are we supposed to... You will join the security as reinforcements. You both know Rep. Katayama. Must be a perfect assignment for you. We're giving a job to the useless Special Task. Be grateful and work hard. Yes, sir. Security detail? We're just doubles. Not to board the security object in the targeted car is the best choice when it's urgent. What? What? What happened? What happened? Take a detour. Please duck. Firecrackers. Kameyama! It's trying to go under the car and explode. Take a detour. Hurry. Go, go, go. Where are they? Damn it! The package bomb made a loud noise but wasn't lethal at all. It was like a firecracker. Red line is explosive contents of radio-control car. Including the package bomb, these are those used by Red Canary in the past 10 years. Does not match them. Draw attention from radio-control car with firecrackers. Doesn't seem like the radicals' style. He checked that out. The perpetrator is elsewhere? May I see Nakajima's investigation file? I downloaded it. Can you enlarge this part? All right. The one this morning... How'd you notice that? It's a familiar code. So, the two cases are related? If these come in order of "f6" and "d4" the first one must be somewhere. Kameyama, I heard you did well. You must be joking. I got reprimanded. Forget the Chief Inspector. I heard the Security guys want you. Oh, please. I'm sure that's baloney. I don't think that's a bad offer. Do you remember what I used to be called? "Ukyo Sugishita, personnel graveyard"? "Those working under Sugishita all leave the Police Force." I haven't left. The Special Task Section is where they oust those useless to the Police organization. It's wrong not to use efficient personnel. So, that's what he said. I have no idea what's on his mind. "I need you. Always be with me." Do you expect Ukyo to say such a thing? Hey, I didn't mean to... You never used this before. Why now? Curious? My, my, you really said that? What do you mean said that? Mr. Kameyama must be feeling lonely now. I didn't mean anything. I just told him the truth. Be considerate and sensitive. Don't say unnecessary things. It's my bad habit. What is that? Oh, this? I'm entering. The Marathon? That. Look at it. This is: "Run the Metropolis." Yes, I'm running with Tamaki. Tamaki, too? We both won the lottery. Our goal is to finish within 4 hours. Can Tamaki? Sure she can. I'm going. Notice anything unusual, related to the deceased Mr. Nakajima? Anything unusual, ah... Anything. Suspicious person hanging around... a visitor... Last week a person called many times, saying it was important and wanted to talk to him. Of course, I refused. What kind of person? A woman. I think she was quite young. I see. A young woman. Investigation 1 doesn't think Nakajima's case is related to Katayama's case. With Security in charge, we won't get any information. The negative aspect of sectionalism. Excuse me. Assistant Inspector Jinkawa. Is anything the matter? I found something amazing. Again? Did the most wanted move in next door? No. This time, it's for real. Let me use this. Takaomi Nakajima Tower Murder was, in fact, a murder announced in advance. SNS? What's that? Social Networking Service. A members only website. A community site on trials. I became a member, but hadn't visited it for long. The People's Court? Yes, where the people are judges. And execution means to put to death. So the Execution List? Any member can write on the bulletin board anonymously. This is the bulletin on Nakajima. "He's cocky." "His comments are biased." It beings with such comments. They're crucifying him. After all the criticisms this always appears. Is Nakajima guilty? What is this? And the last part is this. Guilty - 1,372 Abstain - 13 Not Guilty - 11 Death Sentence Receiving the Death Sentence, the name enters the Execution List. Scandalous company executives or celebrities saying the wrong things... Almost everyone makes the list. So many names... received Death Sentences. Nakajima's name is over here. Death Sentence - using TV as his personal property. "Death by hanging from a TV tower." For real? Terrific, huh? Kameyama. Over here. Hinako Katayama... "Death Sentence - Made politics a farce with her bombshell statements." Is the perpetrator killing, according to this list? It's highly probable the executions may continue. Let's find out the owner of this website. Yes. EXECUTION LIST Who're you? Police. Police? Yes, the Police. Let go. What does the Police want? You made this execution site didn't you? It was taken over. Let go of that. Damn you! You hurt me. - Why'd you attack me? - You attacked me. - Took you for a robber. - Me? With this righteous face? Your site was taken over? It used to be a community site on trials. When I got busy and couldn't manage it, he offered to help out. Help? Who? One of the members. I allowed anonymous participation, and used e-mail. Don't know his name. Do you mean, this person changed the contents of the site? Yes. Gave him management rights. Can't close it down. Can't take out the members' data, either. Damn. Can the Police help? Well... ah... Just in case, tell me the e-mail address of the person, who took over. Sure, but I don't think it's in use. STALEMATE... I didn't tell you to begin. Once more. STALEMATE... Spell it out. Kameyama, there's one person who bothers me. "Noriaki Kisugi." Tokyo High Court judge. Why does he bother you? He died in a traffic accident 2 weeks ago. It was after 6 a.m. The victim was hit by a car during his daily jogging. It's a hit-and-run. The vehicle was a stolen car. Seems it was abandoned in the neighboring town. No finger prints or items left. At a hearing on Dangerous Driving Law last year, Judge Kisugi ruled preferable to the accused. Because of this, he was found guilty at that People's Court. "Execution Method." "Death Sentence - protecting the evil driver." "To be killed by dangerous driving." Judge Kisugi was the 1st victim of these executions. So, it wasn't a simple hit-and-run. These are the photos of the site. Thank you. Ukyo, this graffiti... Does it happen to say e4? E4... How did you know? I see. Thank you. Just as I thought. A young woman about 20 years old came to visit Judge Kisugi this month. She must be the same woman who tried to contact Nakajima. Ukyo, isn't it about time you told me what you're getting at? How was I able to predict the code? White Black The Chess Game Record shows each hand by a letter and a number. It's the same as Shogi. Like 3-2-Gold. In Chess, piece code comes first. If King moves like this, the code will be... Ke2. I see. Only with Pawn, Fu for Shogi, the piece code is not used. So, this hand is... e4. E4? Ah! At Nakajima's murder site the code was f6. When Katayama was attacked, the code was d4. They're all Chess moves. But f6 is for the Black piece. Since White goes first in Chess, if Black moves to f6 and White moves to d4, the Game began with White's move. Judging from standard moves, e4 has the highest probability. Why did the perpetrator leave Chess codes at crime scenes? I have no idea whatsoever about that. But if the perpetrator is enjoying murder like a game, it is absolutely unforgivable. "Execution List"? Both of the deceased victims were on the list. They were killed as written. "Hinako Katayama - Her bombshell statements will blow her up." It's not a funny joke. The perpetrator is not a radical, opposing the Bill, but, we think, a serial killer using this SNS. In the past weeks, did a woman about 20 give you a call? I wonder... Okada, did such a person call? There are countless calls for petitions and such. Besides, 70% of your supporters are women. I'm coming in. Well, well. Very interesting, indeed. How are you? Yonezo SETOUCHI -Lower House Rep. Heard about you two. You protected her, didn't you? Let's not... Rep. Setouchi, if there was anything, I would have visited you. I was in the neighborhood, and it's not that important. They want Mikuriya and me to be promoters of that Marathon. I know what their scheme is. Scheme? What scheme? They want him and former Prime Minister Mikuriya to be friends again, I assume. Even Sugishita sees through you. Friends? Rep. Setouchi former Prime Minister Mikuriya and my father, Yoichi Katayama were sworn friends. In the Mikuriya Cabinet, Rep. Setouchi was Law Minister. And your late father was Foreign Minister. We were all elected about the same time. Became to be called the 3 Sly Farts of the Lower House. How terrible! Mikuriya and I basically didn't get along. Her dad was the mediator. So, when he died, the other two decided to take different paths. It's a great opportunity. So, I asked you two to be promoters. Former Minister Setouchi came in, didn't he? I didn't notice. What does he want? Groundwork for the Transmission Monitoring Bill? Want to interview Rep. Katayama? Application, please. Keisuke SHIKATEBUKURO Diet Journal Reporter Seeing you two here must mean things may become complicated again. We are trying not to make it so. Anything I can do? Tell me. I may not be of much help, though. We're grateful. YASUNAGA COSMETIC SURGERY CLINIC Good evening. Excuse me. We'd like to see Dr. Yasunaga. Hello. Kameyama. Excuse me. We're from the Police. Coming in. Ukyo, look at this. She's dead. I think she was injected something. I'm sure it's the same perpetrator. It's cowardly. Damn. Cause of death is poisoning. Probably nitro-compound. There's a bruise at the back of her head. Knocked out and then injected? The hospital staff told me the victim stayed to arrange the patients' files. It certainly is a bizarre case. It is. Why the hell did Special Task Kameyama find the body? How did you know the victim was in danger? By this. "Execution List"? On a mysterious SNS, crackpots are putting celebrities on trial. The victim was sentenced to death there. Sentenced to death? Why? Dr. Yasunaga, the victim, was also known as a commentator on TV. She was found guilty, since her comments got on people's nerves. Just for that? Method of execution is also stated. "Malpractice - unsuccessful operatione." Wait a minute. What is going on? In the past few weeks, didn't someone come to visit the victim? Must've been a woman about 20. There was. Yayoi Morimura... contact address... ...hotel? Give it here. Miss Yayoi Morimura? Hold this photo and look at it very carefully. A week ago, didn't you visit this woman at Yasunaga Cosmetic Surgery Clinic? If you didn't go for treatment, what was your purpose to see her? I refuse to talk. What about Judge Noriaki Kisugi and ex-newscaster Takaomi Nakajima? You tried to contact them, too, didn't you? Refuse to talk? Doesn't work that way. What're you doing? Who told you to investigate? This is our case. I want Special Task to lay off. Hurry up and get out. Ukyo. I'm Muto from Muto Law Office. Ah, yes... I know about you. What business does a lawyer have here? By what right are you questioning her? It's a voluntary appearance. She has been informed of that. If it's voluntary, she has the right to refuse. Besides, her existence is very delicate, far beyond your imagination. C'mon. Let's go. Oh, yes. Fingerprints acquired without consent cannot be used as evidence. Be careful. It's very kind of you to remind us. Okyo Central Bar Association sent us a formal complaint in Muto's name. That woman is clearly involved in the cases. Three people have been killed. Are you telling us to do nothing about it? Listen. If you anger her further, you won't be the only one punished. Including dealings with the Bar Association, I will handle it all. Do you understand? Yes. What's up? It's the address of the person who took over the SNS. What's that Qh5? MAIL TRANSMITTED The codes of the moves left at the sites come in this order. First, White Pawn goes to e4. To that, Black goes to f6. White d4, Black g5... This is the Queen. In Shogi, it's Hisha plus Kaku. A super piece, making both moves. Move this to h5. This is Black King, so it's Checkmate. No escape? Yes, Checkmate. The code is. So Qh5 means move Queen to h5. Checkmate. You can win this quickly? It's Fool's Mate. A type of dumb move in Japanese. Actually, almost never used. But the perpetrator left this move. How long will he continue killing? We must stop him from such ridiculous acts. There's a response. YOU'VE GOT MAIL Finally, a person bright enough. What is your name? If you win, a surprise awaits you. Information Disclosure? Yes. Won't you demand lawyer Kaori Muto to disclose information on Yayoi Morimura? Who she is and the reason why she is in Muto's custody? I can, but it won't be easy. Koken ONOD A General Secretariat, Police Agency She will confront us with Duty of Confidentiality. And will her client consent to it? I thought only you can make it happen. What're you doing? Be quiet. He can't concentrate. What? He's indulged in a game of Chess with the perpetrator. Take Bishop with Queen. The serial killer, using the SNS, challenged him to a game of Chess. That's why we want Ukyo to win this game. TRANSMITTING MAIL Checkmate. Did you win? The game's over. Did you win? I think I saw this shape recently... You're right. Kameyama, the pamphlet. I have it. It's the Tokyo Big City Marathon course. Cancel it? Are you out of your mind? If the Chess moves are similar to the course, why would that be a warning from the perpetrator? Don't be roused up by such similarity. But, sir. There was a murder attempt on Rep. Katayama, one of the promoters, we assume the Marathon is the target. It's your job to prevent such things. Imihiko MIKURIYA Former Prime Minister But Rep. Katayama will attend various events. It is physically impossible to secure her safety completely. Then, it's simple. All I have to do is resign. But you're a promoter. I guess it's all right. She says she'll resign. This is a great opportunity. Do Mikuriya a favor and let him remember it. My, my, you're teasing me. As you just heard, Rep. Katayama has kindly agreed. The Marathon will be held as scheduled. Since Katayama resigned, Investigation 1 is relieved, but... will she be safe now? Not knowing the perpetrator's motive bothers me. Motive? What about found guilty in People's Court? There were 63 names on the Execution List. There are 4 victims. Considering the original meaning of the list, he should try to kill all. That's gruesome. Or perhaps, there may be some difference between these 4 and the others on the list. You mean something different? Good evening. Welcome. I went to get my number, Tamaki. I went in the daytime. Voila! What do you think? Really running? Yes. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Just that... Numbers are close. Let's run together. If we get separated, we'll know our positions with this. - What is it? - A chip. A chip? To be precise, a Measure Chip. Attach it on the shoe, and they'll measure time at each gate. You can also confirm runner position on mobile or PC. That's in this? Recent marathons are hi-tech. Wataru... I see. So the persuasion was unsuccessful. He is very stubborn. People said that was his strength when he was Prime Minister. Now, it's nothing more than old-age pollution. As I told you, please don't return the plate. I've told you many times, but each time you seem to forget. To forget is a wonderful ability God has bestowed on man. Pardon? I remembered something unpleasant the other day. According to your logic, to remember and not to forget is a more valuable ability. I get your point. I'll remember that. And yet, I may forget again. Man is made to forget. Made Task Force and forsook it. Have you forgotten that? You certainly remember old events. Oh, I almost forgot. I cleared that thing for you. That thing? About the lawyer named Muto. I didn't return it. Basically, we don't reveal our client's request. Please remember this is a rare exception. Do you mean the client consented? The client... She's still a minor. The client is her father. My daughter caused you some trouble. Please let me apologize for that. Please raise your head, Mr. Kisahara. Mr. Kisahara... Ah, yes, my name is Yoshinobu Kisahara. Please. I'm sure you both remember what happened to Mr. Kisahara's son. 5 years ago. I'm sorry for the trouble we caused that time. The U.S. Military advanced to Erdobia in South America, and gave birth to refugees. Mr. Kisahara's son, Wataru, joined an NPO to rescue the refugees. While on a rescue mission in Erdobia, he was abducted by anti-American guerrillas. In return for Wataru's return, the guerrillas demanded a huge ransom to the Japanese Gov't. But... If our demand is not met by Oct. 25, we will execute the hostage. Erdobia was in the state of war and Japanese nationals were notified to evacuate. Since he stayed disregarding this, they said... It served him right. The government stressed that. "We did all we could. We cannot..." "be responsible for those, disregarding our Notice." And cleverly guided public opinion. Many of the press followed that stance. Is resigning the Univ. Related to this case? I didn't think of it. Wataru Kisahara's - irresponsible As a result the Kisaharas became targets of unreasonable criticisms and bashing. Hello. Your son should drop dead. Finally, even she who was in junior high at the time... Disgrace to Us Japanese And, 7 days after the abduction, it ended in the worst case scenario. We are Erdobia Homeland and Freedom. The Japanese Government has refused our demand. Therefore, we execute the hostage. Did you change your name because of that? Please help. I beg you. Please help Shioya. It was Shioya, who invited my brother to join the NPO. They were such close friends. Even when I was in junior high, Shioya treated me like an adult. After that incident, Shioya quit both the NPO and college and disappeared. But... this spring, this suddenly arrived. Thank you. A confession of his crimes, isn't it? Crimes? 5 years ago, Shioya was supposed to go to Erdobia. At the last moment, he begged my brother to take his place. Why? He wrote the reason. "I was scared." "Every time I heard about the condition in Erdobia, I was scared." "I got a job at a major company," "I couldn't suppress my fears, and ran." That's why Shioya blamed himself. He canceled his job and did that. Did what? They're the SNS address and password. When I saw them, I knew that he was avenging my brother. I beg you. Please stop Shioya. Please stop him. Yes, please stop him. I don't want anymore to be hurt because of Wataru. I beg you. Please stop him. Ukyo, I found it. Thesis, Judge Kisugi wrote after Wataru was killed. He agreed with the Government's decision? I also found something. It's Satoko Yasunaga on TV at the time. But he deliberately ignored the Evacuation Notice, so it serves him right. And did newscaster Nakajima... He reported, siding with the government and said that he deserved to die. And Katayama? Excuse me. I found something again. What is it? It's SNS. I've been watching it 24-7. You told me to do what I can. I meant accounting. Let me use that again. A message? It's the page for the manager. Can't enter without a password. May I? 1l2 and 1l2? It means a draw in Chess. You're in. With Stalemate, I typed this in at the end. Kazunori Shioya's address was Stalemate, too. What's Stalemate? It's a type of draw a special Chess rule. "Does S-File really exist?" "If it does, it must be sealed deep in House of Demons." "How can we shed light on it?" S-File? What do you mean sealed? If Shioya is so concerned about it, it must be some document, related to that Hostage Case. It says House of Demons. Must be the Foreign Ministry. Confidential document? They're Chess codes. Seem to be different from the game with me. RENEW: "EXECUTION LIST" Rep. Katayama wasn't the target. The target of Shioya's revenge are: "No need to pay the ransom", "he deserves to die"... and the nameless many, who let the young man die. So, as a result, all in this country. 30,000 runners and 150,000 spectators. Tokyo Big City Marathon. The radicals, my ass. Should've let us handle it from the start. They let the Security handle it. Here they are. The suspect is Kazunori Shioya. Age 27. Currently jobless with no fixed residence. Marathon starts at 9 a.m. Tomorrow. We must apprehend the suspect by then. This must be accomplished with your heart and soul. Hey, on the monitor. S-File? Seems related to the current case. Do you know anything about it? It's related to the Hostage Case 5 years ago and has been sealed and hidden by the Foreign Ministry. It must be a confidential file. Not even heard of it. Even a cabinet member as yourself don't know about it? I was Law Minister not Foreign Minister. It must be one of those ridiculous rumors, going around the Diet. Is it? Kameyama, let's leave. Sorry for bothering you at night. - Thank you, sir. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Sir. It's late, so I'll get to the point. Ukyo Sugishita now knows about the existence of the S-File. So he did. Thank you for telling me. I dragged my old bones just to tell you that. Why don't you tell me what the S-File really is? I myself barely know what it is. Suffice it to say... it's like a ghost. Ghost? Yes. It was my father's only unfinished business. If so, all the more you must let him rest in peace. I'm leaving. I know my way. Ukyo, only one hour before the start. 42.195 km. The suspect can pop up anywhere. I know, but... Shioya's message was by Chess codes. Since he's obsessed with Chess the answer must be in this. This move is obviously wrong. It says Knight b6, but in this situation Knight must move to c6, and not b6. A typing error? Marathon course's east-west and north-south distances are almost equal. C6... Kameyama, the 1st Water Spot. Hurry. Look for something related to a horse. Horse? Roger. Let me introduce the Invitational Runners. Ms. Yuko Arimori. Darling didn't come home last night. Really? He called. He lied and said it was an easy case. I can tell it's a difficult one. You've been together long. Perhaps something will happen today. Anything wrong? Ukyo, I'm here. I don't think it's far from the course. Look inside the square. Roger. Horse... Found it. There's a box. Rectangular Chess board pattern, not big. It may explode. Don't move it until the Bomb Squad arrives. Got it. I found a card. There're question marks after Nc6. - What is this? - A Chess code. It's almost an error. It means it's a useless move. You're kidding. Ukyo, it's a dummy. Kameyama, there's another typing error move. It's Be3. E3 points to Shiba Park. The piece is Bishop. Roger. Excuse me. I found something amazing. Found Shioya? I asked Yonezawa to record the runners at the registration place. What? Can you get this on the monitor? By "Face Recognition System" I attempted to match Shioya's face with 30,000 runners. MATCH Hair and glasses can change but not basic features. Name and ID must be forged. Please show the number. All right. His number is 11851. We found Shioya. At the starting point. In National Stadium. Miss Tamaki. Miwako. Madam Hiroko. Go for it! That I will! No. 11851? The 11,000s. Around here. Excuse me... Sorry, excuse me The Marathon will soon start. Runners in the back, please don't push the runner in front. This is bad. Stop them. It is the start. The race began. Stop... We didn't find him. The Measure Chip. I'll access the Tracing System. What chip? Runners are given a chip for time and position. Let's hope Shioya has it. His number is 11851. - Is this all right? - Thank you. Got it. Kosuke ASAGIRI. 11851. The number matches. To all investigators. Shioya is running among general runners. Apprehend him at 5-km point. Tokyo Big City Marathon. Weather is clearing up, and runners' pace is up. The group is approaching the 5-km point. No. 51, Sato, is pulling the group. Then comes Argalaid from Tanzania and there is No. 12, Suzuki. They are coming. They have passed the 5-km point. He'll soon pass the 5-km point. All in position. We're at the 5-km point. This is impossible. 11851... 11851... Now, now. Now. Apprehend him! 11851... I can't tell. Hey. Where is he? Maybe he already passed. He's passed. He's passed. Did you apprehend Shioya? Heading for the 10-km point. Ukyo, now in Shiba Park. The piece is Bishop so find something religious. Roger. Out of the way. Let me pass. This is the Police. That's Inspector Itami. Look. She looks familiar. Why is his wife running? Almost 10 kms. He's coming. Here he comes. Here he comes. There. Hey, isn't that him? Secured. Secured. Turn his face this way. Take the cap. Take the glasses, too. He's not Shioya. The number... Number 11821... Wrong number. What?! What's going on? But the chip is definitely Shioya's. Then why? There's another chip. Why have 2 chips? I don't know. I didn't notice but probably hung it there. Must've put his chip on someone else before the start. Chess piece... Cross... priest... Not again. Damn. Ukyo, it was bogus again. Please keep your mobile on. This is the only mistaken code site. I may have overlooked something. At such a time I wish I can say something nice, but I'm no good with games like Chess... How come? Maybe because I'm a piece of an organization, and become emotional. You're a strange one. Some are frequently used, yet seeing those that are never used, I see myself in them. - What was that? - Sorry I broke your concentration. What did you say? About pieces that are never used. That's it. Are there pieces never used? No, on the contrary... Just as I thought. There is one square no pieces are placed or even pass through. Is there a map? On the map, g4 is over here. All men, head for Rinkai Bridge. Kameyama. Kameyama. Hurry to Rinkai Bridge now. I'm going, too. Go, go. Ukyo, over here, over here. Ukyo. Inspector, what is going on? How did you know it's here? This must be the last place hidden in the code. Then, a real bomb is... What? Front runners are approaching Nihonbashi and reach the Bridge in 15 min. The Bridge is 500m long. Targeting a mass of runners damage will be horrendous. But we swept the course and its surroundings with metal detectors. Explosives should already be found. He's informed us his target. He's aware of the metal detectors. But if he chose this place, he must have a reason. The bridge... There is a suspicious boat 1 km downstream Rinkai Bridge. Kameyama. Why are you here? Just drive. Let's search around here. Hey, guys, around here. Search for the bomb. - The suspicious boat? - Over there. Began moving on its own. That boat... That. Damn. Kameyama. Lend us your boat. Police. Get off. It's driving away. Itami, call Ukyo on the mobile. You're a regular slave driver. Ukyo. Unmanned boat heading for Rinkai Bridge. May explode ramming the bridge girder. Kameyama, change its direction. Roger. Close Rinkai Bridge? Not yet. Wait a little more. Closer. Closer. I know. Faster. I know. This is full speed. A bit more. Closer. A bit more. He jumped on the boat. The steer won't move. Engine won't stop. Engine won't stop. Do something. Hurry. Do something. Explosion avoided. Ukyo. All we do now is catch Shioya. Isn't it strange? What is? It's as if the boat with explosives was waiting for you to arrive. Shioya's watching our every move. If so, the runners hadn't arrived at that point. Even if it exploded as planned there was almost no casualty. You're right. The Execution List said runner and spectators, but Rinkai Bridge is the only spot closing out the spectators. Was that boat a dummy, too? Sugishita speaking. Mr. Sugishita? Miss Muto told me this number. I remembered where Shioya may appear. Where can that be? Yotsuba Electric warehouse. Yotsuba Electric? Shioya and my brother met there working as part-timers. I heard that before. I must know if Shioya is doing this. This is the Ariake Colosseum Marathon Grounds. I'll head there now. Yayoi. What is it? Yotsuba Electric warehouse... Heard the Ariake Colosseum announcement. Yotsuba Electric... It's right near the goal. Yayoi is heading there. Shioya could possibly be hiding there. Hurry. Top runners will soon arrive. Police. I'll go to the warehouse. Find Yayoi and hold on to her. Roger. Shioya... Shioya... Shioya... What happened? Cyanide. You mustn't die. For Wataru's sake, you mustn't die. Shioya... Shioya... Ukyo, are you in there? Ukyo. Kameyama. Where's Yayoi? She's here. But a time bomb is ticking and the door is jammed. That's useless. Call the paramedics and Fire Dept. But... Please hurry. Shioya. Shioya. Shioya. Yayoi. Please get in here. There's no time. Ukyo. Ukyo! Ukyo. Yayoi. Yayoi? Yayoi. Are you all right? I'm glad to see you. No injuries? Ukyo. All right? Let's go. Go? To catch the perpetrator. But wasn't Shioya? It isn't over yet. Let's hurry. Yayoi, please wait here. An ambulance will soon come. Tokyo Big City Marathon 2008 will now commence the Award Ceremony. We will begin with Men's Full Marathon. The presentater is a promoter of this event. The 91st Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Kimihiko Mikuriya, please come forward. The Champion of Men's Full Marathon is Kota Suzuki of Nankyu Dept. Store. Time: 2 hours 10 minutes 43 seconds. Kameyama. Let's end this, Mr. Kisahara. I'm your Chess opponent. Please. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. I will have no peace, unless I kill him. Mr. Kisahara. Let's go. How did you know? Until I went to the warehouse, I believed Shioya was the perpetrator. But what I found there were notes, instructing the Chess game. There is a person controlling Shioya. And that person has the motive to kill those victims. And you concluded... Above all, this was decisive. Such a habit is hard to forget. It's unloaded. I had a call from Kisahara's physician. Doctor's prognosis. Cancer? It's progressive and very rapid. He has 6 months. Kisahara has been informed. Shioya was the one to carry out all the plans I made, so I'm the principal perpetrator. He's confessing. Take a break? No, I'm all right. That was superb Zugzwang. You lured me to play along with you. You mean that game? No, everything that happened this time. The more we tried to act, following your moves, the more we were misled. As you can see, this is how it ended. But wasn't it your plan to end it this way? What would you be talking about? Your gun was not loaded. With rational thinking, I cannot believe you would use a gun, a weapon, which killed your son. If so, what did I do all that for? I think it was all for the S-File. How did a file, sealed by Foreign Ministry, become to be called the S-File? This is... merely my hypothesis. The S for S-File stands for stalemate, doesn't it? You are clever, so I was not wrong to choose you as my opponent. Stalemate is not a simple draw. It is a way to force a no-win situation to an unmovable one and, thus, a draw. The file was probably named by a Foreign Ministry official aware of Mikuriya's love for Chess. When I heard of the S-File, I could easily assume what they did or what they didn't do. I could almost picture it. First of all, to target Mikuriya who is already retired was the Award Ceremony really necessary? What you needed was the mass of spectators and the live TV broadcast. You wanted to make Mikuriya admit to S-File in front of the public and reveal its contents. A dangerous gamble. Risk of being arrested was high. You were, indeed, arrested, but even then, you still have one move left. The trial. If you are prosecuted and put on trial, you'll have a chance to testify. In front of the public eye, you will testify that the S-File led you to commit the crime. Revealing the file content to the public is, I believe, your final and ultimate goal. Mr. Sugishita, do you remember how it was 5 years ago? The press reports were abnormal. TV, newspapers, magazines... All covered Wataru everyday. Even chased me and my daughter around. But what I think strange even now... What is it? The heated coverage, when that footage ran, stopped all at once. Stopped completely. As if the incident didn't exist. Wasn't it strange? Was it because they saw the footage? All pretended it never happened. Ignored what happened to my son. I felt they were trying to forget it all. But you know, Mr. Sugishita, I will never, never allow such a thing. My son was ignored by this country, by unseen irresponsibility and by silent malice, and the fact that he was left to die must never be rid from people's mind in the state of limbo. I will never, never allow it! So, I ask of you, Mr. Sugishita, to terminate this questioning, and commit me for a trial. I can't waste any time. I want to shed light on the S-File in court as soon as I can. I beg you. Please, Mr. Sugishita. Mr. Sugishita. What you are saying is right. I agree with you. But the method you chose was wrong. I had no idea he was ill. I see. I'm abandoned again. Abandoned? My father abandoned me. When he told me to change my name, he ignored my feelings. He decided all by himself. It's the same again. About Shioya, about his illness... He never said a word. It's because he cares for you. We only have each other. My father abandoned me twice. From General Secretariat secret fund? I'm kidding. It's proper, but no receipt required. But isn't it too steep? It wasn't easy. I had to pay to all those concerned. It was an outrageous assignment, like catching a ghost. Ukyo, it's unbelievable. What's the matter? They're not prosecuting Kisahara. They're re-arresting him for possession of firearms. So it was your doing. It's time you came. He only has 6 months to live. Do you intend to buy time till then? If a bomb like the S-File goes public, the Foreign Ministry will lose face. Understand? I see. You did know the content of the S-File. I never said that. In addition, you were pressured by the very few people, who know the contents. Don't you think all this publicity is enough? All will feel the pain of the Hostage Case 5 years ago. Unless the contents are revealed, people will not regret what they did. Regret? People forget. The current case is branded in their minds now, but if another incident occurs tomorrow and another next week, they will once again forget. As you say, man is such a life form. All the more, don't you think Yoshinobu Kisahara should speak out? Let me say it is futile to look for it, since a man took it to his grave. Even so, there are those, who like to dig up graves. What're you doing? Re-arrest. Must re-question. Why? He already said everything. He already confessed. Why do it again? Shut up. I know that. Hey, what's the matter? Hey. Mr. Kisahara. All right? Call the ambulance! Mr. Kisahara. You can't die now, not in such a place. You're going to court, aren't you? You must live until you've had your say. The S-File... Whatever it takes I must reveal the S-File. For Yasue, my daughter. For her sake, too. Mr. Kisahara, be strong. KANTO CENTRAL POLICE HOSPITAL The doctor in charge said the next few days would be crucial. I see... In addition to his already short lifespan, he pushed himself to the limit. His daughter. We will now begin an urgent press conference by Hinako Katayama. What I am about to reveal is a document related to the Hostage Case 5 years ago. By political decision, it was concealed in Foreign Ministry, and buried until this day. Wasn't the Foreign Minister at the time your father? Did he have a hand in the concealment? Yes. The case Wataru Kisahara was killed? Was it concealment by Government? Was Mr. Mikuriya involved? Are you trying to unearth your father's dishonorable deed? To reform Foreign Ministry has been Rep. Katayama's platform, since she was elected. For the one to be accused, it is more like an act of terrorism than reform. She really did it. What a way to let her father rest in peace! May God rest his soul. From the content of the document, I do not wish to criticize the Gov't or the Ministry at the time. In 2003, Foreign Ministry announced that Evacuation Notice to Japanese in Erdobia was issued by October 15. Yet, the document states the Notice reached the Refugee Camp, where Mr. Kisahara was, on October 20. But Mr. Kisahara was abducted by the guerrillas on October 18. Is that? That is, Mr. Wataru Kisahara did not receive the Evacuation Notice. Mr. Kisahara didn't know about the Evacuation Notice? Gov't's argument that they cannot be responsible for those, who disregarded the Notice, was clearly wrong. The document's latter portion has copies of many letters attached. The Japanese Embassy in Erdobia's neighboring country sent these letters, which were written by the children of Erdobian. Children of refugee camps, schools in the mountains and hospitals, where Mr. Kisahara did relief work until he was abducted. Let me read the translation. "Dear Wataru, Our school re-opened today." "We can finally use the notebooks and pencils you gave us." "I'm studying hard as you told me to." "When I grow up, I want to go to your country." "Wataru, I truly thank you." "Thank you, Wataru." Father. Father. Mr. Kisahara, staked his limited time, and wanted to tell you about this. When he collapsed your father told me... Please tell Yasue... All right. What is it? Tell her I'm sorry. Mr. Kisahara always kept this letter with him. "Dear Mr. Kisahara," "My name is Charles Earlman." "I did volunteer work with Wataru in Erdobia." "I am very sad for Wataru's demise." "I was angry about" "unreasonable bashing Wataru received from the Japanese press." "I'm sure it was insufferable to his family, too." "Wataru was a dear friend." "There is something I must tell you, so" "I wrote this letter." "Bad memories may return, but" "you must face what I know." "6 volunteers including Wataru and myself," "were in a small village." "In this village notice for transport of goods" "come in once a week before noon." "Notice didn't come even at night." "Leaving 4 colleagues, including Wataru, in the village," "a colleague and I went to town." "In the cities, Gov't forces and the guerrillas had clashed." "We heard the casualties were expanding," "and we took refuge in the American Embassy." "There, an official told us that" "the Evacuation Notice was issued by the embassies." "I regret we did not return" "to the village to inform the others about the Notice." "We heard from the Japanese Embassy officials" "that Wataru was abducted by the guerrillas." "According to them," "Foreign Ministry instructed them to notify those in the city first." "So notification to the rural areas was done later." "Wataru was killed" "and heated media coverage followed." "As a friend," "I cannot bear the unreasonable bashing Wataru received." "I regret I am not in the position to clear Wataru's name." "I am sure" "Wataru was, to the end working for the people of Erdobia." "Wataru was sweet and everyone loved him." "We, Wataru's colleagues," "think of him all the time." "I hope" "the truth will someday" "be revealed." Mr. Kisahara, we will always remember that there were young people like your son, who were trying to change the world. NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Good luck. Thanks. Take care. Goodbye. Shall we go? Yes, let's. Directed by Seiji Izumi English Subtitles by Jeanette Amano The story is fiction.
