[engine whirring] - [Dementia] Oh there it is, that's it. Pull in here. [keys jangling] [logo whooshing] Come one, what are you waiting for? - [Dez] Oh, I can't believe you talked me into coming out here in the middle of the night like this. - [Dementia] Oh, get out here silly. - [Dez] Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. [door opens] [door beeping] [door closes] [camera whirring] Okay, let me focus this damn thing. Where are you? Oh, there you are. - It's "Dez and Dementia's Midnight Horror Hour." With your hostess, Dementia Shame. [Dementia giggles] - [Dez] Cute. We are gonna get so busted. [Dementia chuckles] - And you weren't worried about that the first time we came back here. Remember? The back seat of your parents' car? - [Dez] Oh yeah. [Dementia giggles and kisses] - You know, I wish they'd put there damn mall someplace else. This is our place. - [Dez] Our place, huh? - Yeah. As in our first time. - [Dez] Wait a minute. What about that night in your parents' living room during the "Bob Newhart Show?" - [chuckles] That doesn't count. It wasn't a full moon. - [Dez] Got it, sorry. - Yeah, I just wish they'd take the bulldozers and go way. Anyway, I thought we'd come up here for one last fling. - [Dez] Fling? - Yeah. Come on. - [Dez] Come on where? - Let's have a look around. - Are you kidding? It's the middle of the night. And it's dark in there. - Oh, is my big, bad goth boy afraid of the dark? - [Dez] No, hell no. - What is it then? The witches? - [Dez] Yeah, right. - Oh, come on, we all know the stories about all the witches buried in the woods out here. Oh, we even believed 'em when we were kids. - [Dez] Yeah, we believed in the Tooth Fairy too. - Oh, okay. So you're not scared. Come on, let's go. - [Dez] Why don't we come back tomorrow before sunset? I mean, the light will be better. - You have light. Besides, I don't wanna come back tomorrow. I'm in the mood now. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Please. Pretty please? Do it for me. [Dementia giggles] - [Dez] You better make good on that promise if I have to go into these damn woods. [insects chirping] Dementia, where are you? This is no time to play hide and seek. Is she out of her mind? Dementia. Come on. This isn't funny anymore. - Boo! - Jesus! I almost pissed myself. - Oh, come on. Would you lighten up? - [Dez] How do you know the we're alone? I mean, anybody could be out here watching us. - Ooh. A witch, maybe. After all, this is their place too. They're probably as pissed off as we are. Maybe they're pissed off enough for revenge. [Dementia giggles] - Yeah, well you can just... [snarling] Did you hear that? - Hear what? - [Dez] I heard something. - [chuckles] You are so paranoid. - [Dez] I'm not fucking around. I heard something. - I'm sorry. It's my fault. I had to go bring up all the big, bad witches. - [Dez] That's not the point. I'm telling you, somebody else is out here. - Yeah, just bra me. You know what? I should have known better. To think that this place held any sentimental value to you at all. - [Dez] You know that's not true. [snorting] - I heard it that time. - [Dez] I can't see anything. - You know, let's go back to the car, okay? We can't even be alone without some pervs spying on us. - [Dez] Come on, the car's not far. [whispering] Shit! - [Dementia] Oh God, they're following us! - [Dez] Are you sure? I hear something up in the trees! - [Dementia] I don't even have a shirt! - [Dez] Forget it. I'll buy you a new one. - Ow! Ow! - [Dez] Are you all right? - Yeah. Fine. [blade scraping] [machete whooshes] [flesh squelches] [Dez gasping] [Dementia screaming] [machete whooshes] [flesh squelches] [Dementia screaming] [body thuds] [machete clinks] [Dementia screaming] [whooshing] [static buzzing] - That was three months ago. The last time anyone heard from those kids. At first this footage was dismissed as some kind of hoax. Although these days it seems people will think anything is real if it's hyped well enough. Anyway, yesterday a crew preparing the property for demolition dug up this. They're graves. And they're pretty old from what I can see here. Four buddies. They're definitely not the kids in that videotape. So we need to find out exactly who they are. Myths and urban legends aside, your job is to get out there and identify those corpses. The locals have their panties in a bunch because they had to halt construction of their new mega mall until we can find out whose bodies they are and get them properly buried off the site. That's it, Professor Sparrow. A few DNA tests, some historical research with your students. You're in, you're out, you're sleeping. - Sounds like fun. [hard rock music] [birds chirping] - [Woman] So this is home? - For the moment, anyway. This is home sweet home. - Dibs on a room in front. - Don't get too comfortable. Remember, the rest of the team is joining us later tonight. - Yeah, and I am not rooming with Clark. The man snores like a buzzsaw. - Well, we all make sacrifices. - This house gives me the chills. - This entire county gives me the chills. [door creaking] [crows cawing] [ominous music] Speaking of which, this guy looks like he ate the long arm of the law. - Behave yourself, Norman. That's no way to speak to adults with weapons. [Norman chuckles] - Yes, Mother. - Mrs. Sparrow, Sheriff Jake Harmon. Welcome to Covington County. - Really? Quite the fight your city council put up to keep the university away from here. I wasn't expecting such a fuzzy welcome. - You didn't take any of that personally, did ya? - [chuckles] Well, it has only been 110 years since you people burned your last witch. [Jake laughs] - You know, you city folks just kill me. - Okay. - Norman. - [Jake] And who are these good looking youngsters? Students of yours? - Oh, yes. This is Stephanie Zinone. - Miss. - Nice to meet you, Sheriff - And our resident man on the moon here is Norman Soderquist. - Soderquist. What kind of a name is that? - A very difficult one to pronounce, but an easy one to remember. [Jake laughs] - Well fine. And about the city council, you have to understand, they work hard to attract business like that mall to Covington. Means new jobs, a big boost to the economy. - I understand that, Sheriff. - Well all I want is those bodies out of there so we can get on with business as usual. - Trust me, Sheriff, we have no desire to spend a moment longer here than necessary. - That's what I wanna hear. Now if you folks need anything, don't hesitate to give a call, okay? - We'll put you on speed dial. - Oh. [keys jangle] Here are the keys. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. [ominous music] - I don't think I've ever been told that I'm not welcome so politely. [crows cawing] - Well, we're not here to win any popularity contests. Let's just do our jobs and go home. [car starts] - Hey, you've always gotten along with Clark. Bet the two of you could spend some real quality time together. - Forget it, Soderquist. [ominous music] [doors open] [wind whistling] - Jeez, it's colder in here than it is outside. So much for that warm welcome. You think these people ever heard of indoor heating? I'll find the thermostat. [ominous music] - Talk about goth. This is the real deal. - [chuckles] Yeah. If these walls could talk. And obviously they're going to. [doors creaking] [ominous music] - Good a place as any to set up shop. - I can't believe I gave up a scholarship to Oahu U for this. I could be digging for dead things on the beach in Waikiki. - At least the others get to hide out here. You and I have to go into town and start stirring up the locals of this little hamlet. - Unlucky us. [doors creaking] - Okay. We should have heat shortly. - Thank God. So how's this for office space? - Looks good. Sir, my things, please. [keys jangling] And try not to break anything. - I'll try. - [chuckles] Steph and I will get busy in here. Oh, God. [ominous music] - It's good having a man around the house. [both chuckle] [ominous music] [insects chirping] [Clark snoring] - Clark. Clark. [Clark snoring] Clark! - Huh? Huh? What? - You're snoring. - I am? - Yes. - Oh. Sorry, man. Getting back to sleep. [Clark sighs] [ominous music] [Clark snoring] [Norman sighs] - Inconsiderate bastard. [Norman snoring] [ominous music] [footsteps thudding] Hey. I didn't know anyone else was up. - Yeah, just catching up on my reading. - Anything interesting? - "The History of Covington County." Courtesy of the Covington County Tourist Bureau. - Sounds gripping. - I haven't been able to put it down. Oh, juice is on the counter. - Oh, thanks. Okay. - So what's the matter? You can't sleep? - Oh, God. It's Clark. If only he could use the power in his nasal passages for good instead of evil. - They burned them alive. [ominous music] - Come again. - The witches. It says here they used to burn them alive in the town square. - Really? - Yeah. It's actually here in the pamphlet. Can you believe it? They even stage reenactments. - So the things really do cook around here. [Stephanie chuckles] - You know, I'm starting to get the idea this town is a bit off. - You're just now figuring that out. - Sparrow told us to watch our step around here, but this is really sick. - You've never been to one of my family reunions. [ominous music] - Of course, I'm sure there are few sites around here worth checking out. - Yeah. I'm... I'm sure. - Well, good night. I hope you get some sleep. We've got an early day tomorrow. [ambient music] [door closes] - I love my work. [ominous music] - All right guys, gather around. This is a first grave we discovered approximately 72 hours ago. Since then, three others have been unearthed within a 30 yard radius. [crows cawing] I'm estimating their age at a little over 200 years. But Angela, it's gonna be your job to verify that, okay? - You got it. - As for the rest of us, our primary job today is just to gather whatever physical evidence we can from the scene. Then the remains will be exhumed and taken to the town mortuary until we can find any clues to their identity. Any questions? Good. Let's get to work. Clark, can you give me a hand? [indistinct] - Would you get that out of my face, Soderquist? - Come on, easy. Here we go. That's right. Take it easy. [crows cawing] Are we ready? - Lock and load. - Okay. [wood creaking] [ominous music] [all gasping] - Oh God. - Oh. - What is that odor? - Could be something in the ground, chemicals or sulfur buildup of some kind. - There's not much left to work with. What time hasn't gotten to, the worms off. - Clark, can you move a little bit to your left? You're blocking the light. - Oh, sorry. - It's okay. So whoever this is, they waited a long time for their 15 minutes. Let's not ruin it with bad lighting. - Clothing is definitely 18th century. - No visible signs of trauma. - Well, let's map out a DNA sequence for her. Hopefully that will tell us something. Mm. Oh, can you help me up? - Yeah. - Come on, yep. - Oh, looks like we've got our work cut out for us. - Oh God, you're ugly. [lid clatters] - Steph, Norman. I want you to go into town and start digging around. Check the town hall records. Oh, and check with the mortuary to see if they have any burial records, then try to interview as many locals as you can get to open up. Look for anything. Even old wives' tales. All right? - We're on our way. - Oh, look at this. Professor, looks like you have a fan. - Very funny. You guys have my cell phone number if you need anything, right? Otherwise, I'll see you back here tonight. [keys jangling] Good luck. - Hey, I thought I was driving. - Forget it, Soderquist. You just stick to what you do best. - She means using the old noggin. Exercising the old brain muscle. - I think she meant bullshitting, Norman, and believe me, we're gonna need it if we're gonna get some of the locals to talk to us. [crows cawing] [chattering on radio] [crows cawing] - How goes the investigation? - Just getting out of the starting gate. - Good. Glad to hear it. So, what exactly are you people up to today? - Oh, well today we're gathering DNA from our subjects. Because of the condition of the bodies, we'll have to remove a small bone fragment, then we would take it back to the lab and saw away at it, and collect our DNA from the bone dust that accumulates. - Hmm, I see. You know, why even bother? Even if you were to uncover some foul play, it's not like we're gonna go out and round up any suspects. Know what I mean? - The point is that these people deserve a little more respect than just to be dug up at the state's convenience and dropped into the nearest potter's field. [chattering on radio] - You really think it matters to them at this point? - [chuckles] Well, I don't know, Sheriff. So far none of them have actually stood up and voiced an opinion either way. - Well, if they do, [chattering on radio] be sure to let us know, okay? - You'll be the first to know.

Question is, what are you doing here? - Here in this van? - No, here in this field. It's always been a mystery to me why you chose to do this. - Seriously? - Yeah, seriously. - It was my dad. He was a medical examiner for Akron, Ohio. And his dream was for his only son to follow in his footsteps. He and my brother were so close. I always envied their relationship. So when my brother decided he'd rather drill teeth for a living, he broke my dad's heart. I guess I saw that as an opportunity. - [Norman] Uh-huh. And yeah, I know, call me selfish. I decided to study medicine. - [Norman] So how did you end up here? - My dad died the summer after my sophomore year. - [Norman] God, I'm sorry. [soft rock music] - I did a little tinkering with my major. This way I can pursue my interest which is archeology, and still keep my promise to him too. - [Norman] The good daughter. - That's me. So what about you? What demons brought you here? - [Norman] Oh, I just like to play with dead things. [both chuckling] I'm serious. - I know. [soft rock music] [static buzzing] Are we on? - We're rolling. - [Stephanie] Mr. Wilson, you're the town mortician here in Covington. Is that correct? - That is correct. Wilson Mortuary serving the community for nearly 200 years, providing care for you and your loved ones in your time of need. Our prices- - All right, Mr. Wilson. Thank you, sir. - This is going to be on TV, isn't it? - [Stephanie] No, sir, I'm afraid not. This is just for our private record. - Oh, hmm, I see. - [Stephanie] How far back would you say your records go? - Why all the way back to the beginning. We are very meticulous. This business demands it. - [Stephanie] So if someone had been buried in this county in the last two centuries, you would have a record of it? - Yes. Then again, a lot of people didn't exactly prescribe to your typical way of doing things. - [Stephanie] And there would be no official record kept on those occasions? - Mm, no, not likely. Not with us at least. - [Stephanie] Tell us about the bodies discovered at the construction site outside of town. - Oh yeah. I got a place all set up for them in back. You sure are pissing everyone off holding up the work out there. - [Stephanie] We figured someone has to have some record of four people being buried in the same piece of ground. - I'll be happy to go through my records. See what I can find. [chuckles] Unless of course... - [Stephanie] Yes? - I was just going to say unless they were witches. [camera whirring] - [Stephanie] Witches? - [chuckles] Yeah. And I couldn't honestly tell you who kept those records. [Mr. Wilson laughing] [Mr. Wilson coughing] [static buzzing] [ominous music] [insects chirping] [owl hooting] [machinery beeping] [keyboard clattering] - Okay, so how's it going? - It's good. We are just about to get started on the skull from the first set of remains. - Has it been thoroughly cleaned? - Yes. - Good. - You know, we are gonna get a major jump on tomorrow if we can get this DNA sample processed and sent out. - Yeah. I just hope it's not too badly degraded. - Yeah. Would you like to do the honors? - You betcha. [Professor chuckles] [machinery beeping] [ominous music] [saw whirring] [saw buzzing] [saw thuds] [Professor gasps] - Ow, just great. - Are you okay? - Oh, damn, it's deep. It hurts like hell. - You know, it looks like you got some bone dust in there. You better get it cleaned out. - Oh, God. - Don't worry. I'll take care of this here. - Thanks, Angela. - It's all right. - Christ, I'm so stupid. [ominous music] Well, whoever our mysterious subject is, I hope he or she's not hiding any nasty little secrets. [ominous music] [machinery beeping] [wolf howling] [insects chirping] [ominous music] [insects chirping] [owl hooting] [brush scraping] - Honey, you never looked so good. [ominous music] [phone ringing] Hello? - Hi, how are things? - Oh, hi. - [Man] What's up with those bodies? [indistinct] - Yeah, those bodies were moved over from the construction site. [indistinct] I really don't like the idea of having all those people stomping around my place of business. - [Man] Well, you know, there's nothing we can really do about it, the court- - Yeah. I know there's than nothing we can do about it. [indistinct] Hey, listen to this. I was up in the attic going through some old records and you'll never guess what I came across. An old receipt dated 1826. - Really? - Bet you'll never guess what it's for? [indistinct]-- - All right. All right. The receipt is for four cedar coffins. [ominous music] That's right. We may not have buried those people, but it looks like we build the coffins. - [Man] Really? - And you won't believe whose signature is on the receipt. Go ahead. Guess. - [Man] Well I don't know. Why don't you just tell me who it is? [indistinct] - No, no. What? No, I haven't showed it to her yet. [indistinct] Oh, I thought I'd do that in the morning. Surprise her and all. [indistinct] Yeah. [indistinct] Yeah. Sure, sure. - [Man] Okay, well anyhow, that will do it. - Don't worry about it. - All right. - I'll take care of it. [indistinct] Talk to you later. Bye. Bye. - Bye.

[intense music] [sword scrapes and swooshes] Oh, please. [sword swooshes] [book cover thuds] [ominous music] - Sleeping beauty awakes. - Don't start, Norman. We've been pouring over this stuff for nearly nine hours. - Haven't these people ever heard of microfilm or computers or search engines? I mean this is not... You know what they're doing to us here? They're screwing with us. Yeah. [taps hand] You know what's behind this door, don't ya? Computers, the internet, all the information we need just awaiting the touch of a keystroke - [chuckles] Settle down, for God's sakes. - Okay. I'm sorry. It's iMac withdrawal. I mean, books, books give me blurred vision and headaches and paper cuts. My God, paper cuts. - [scoffs] You've been very helpful. No one is trying to screw us over. It's just your imagination. - No, I don't have an imagination. I mean, I not imagining this. You know what I mean. - Actually, it's pretty remarkable. - What is? - That they have over two centuries of history recorded in such detail. - Well, that's another weird thing, isn't it? I mean, if these records are supposed to be so complete, I mean, there's not one mention of those bodies that are buried out there in those woods. - No, I think we should talk to that guy. the librarian mentioned. What was his name? [ominous music] Here it is. Angus Westmore. - Angus. - He's some sort of unofficial town historian. Evidently his ancestors helped sell the area. And as you can see, they liked keeping very close tabs on their neighbors. - I don't think we're gonna find anything here that's gonna help us. - Well, at least the day wasn't a total waste. - Yes, lest we forget that we are now official Covington County Library card holders. [both laughing] [clock ticking] [ominous music] [Professor moaning] - Oh. Oh, my head. Mm. Oh. Mm. Ow. [Professor sighs] Mm. God, I look like shit. Mm. Oh. Mm. [ominous music] [pills rattling] [intense music] [Professor snarls] [birds chirping] [keyboard clattering] [machinery beeping] [hands clap] People. People! Today, I want DNA samples from each of the remaining corpses. Then we will be returning back here to process them ASFP. - Is that it? [ominous music] - I'm sorry... - It's Clark, ma'am. - Right, Clark. Is there something about my instructions that we're not crystal clear to you? - No, I just thought it might be easier to do a full workup since we going to be there anyways, so I... I'm sorry, ma'am. - Nonetheless, we are doing things my way. Understood? Is that understood? [ominous music] [machinery beeping] All right then. [door opens] [computer beeping] [knocking] - Good morning there. [hands slam] - Well good morning, Sheriff. [ominous music] - Well just be heading out now. - Whatever. - So sheriff, what can I do for you this time? - Hey now, I'm not trying to bust your chops, Professor. I'm looking for someone. Al Wilson. You know the fellow that runs the funeral parlor. I thought maybe he might be out here with you folks, for some reason. [Professor chuckling] - You mean you have yourself an honest to God missing person, Sheriff. - Oh well, I wouldn't exactly put it that way. I guess he's kind of hard to find at the moment, s'all. I'm sure he'll turn up. - Well, I don't know. I'd be a little concerned if I were you. Maybe you should call in the troops. [Jake laughing] - That's a good one. You got me. Now listen. Don't you worry. I left one of my deputies over there at the funeral parlor. He'll let you in. - Well thank you. And good luck. You have a nice day now, Sheriff. [ominous music] [birds chirping] - I've never seen her that way before, have you? - No. It's amazing what a Wonderbra will do. [Stephanie scoffs] - Maybe we should have stuck around - For what? I mean, whatever it is, she'll work it out. I don't think she wants us nosing around in her business. - Yeah, I guess you're right. You know, I finally realized what's been bothering me. - Enlighten me, please. - Yesterday, when we interviewed that mortician and he made the offhanded remark. You remember, about the witches? - Is it still bothering you? - Yes, it is. - What are you getting at? - Witch trials were held in this county up into the latter half of the 18th century. I mean, these people are almost proud of it. - Yeah. - If there were witch trials, surely some of them were found guilty and executed. I don't know about you, but I didn't see any mention of executions in the records we went through. - You think someone's hiding them? - Someone knows the truth. - Okay. So what's next? - Angus Westmore. - Ooh, the town watcher. - Something tells me he knows what's going on here. [birds chirping] [sign creaking] [ominous music] Mr. Westmore, your family is one of the oldest in Covington? - My family founded this town. [fire crackling] Fought and died for it. Protected it from all manner of evil. - [Stephanie] Would you mind elaborating on that, sir? [ominous music] - Elaborating? - [Stephanie] Precisely, what are you referring to? - Evil comes in many forms. - [Stephanie] Do you believe in witches, Mr. Westmore? - [Norman] Ah, Steph, are you sure you wanna go there? - [Stephanie] Do you believe the people executed over two centuries ago were actually witches? [ominous music] [fire crackling] - Some. - [Stephanie] Some, not all? - Sometimes the innocent must suffer for the good of all. Do you really want to know the truth? - [Stephanie] Of course we do. - Understand that once you hear the truth, you can't hide from it. You'll share in the guilt with the rest of us. - [Stephanie] If you know something that can help us, you have to say something. [fire crackling] Very well. [ominous music] It began in the year of our Lord, 1826. That fall, a young soldier returned to Covington from California. He brought with him a terrible sickness. It spread quickly and spared no one. A physician was someone from Boston but he could do nothing. Finally, in a moment of utter desperation, the town elders approached a coven of witches who were condemned to death. Driven by fear, the elders entered into an unholy bargain with these evil creatures. In exchange for ending the sickness, it was agreed that the witches would be granted clemency for their sins. [ominous music] [fire crackling] Their lives would be spared. They were led by Lilith LeFay. Beautiful. Wicked. [ominous music] [fire crackling] She led her covenant to the forest and there tey kept their word. The sickness vanished. The doomed rose from their death beds. - [Stephanie] What happened to Lilith? [ominous music] [fire crackling] - She and her coven were betrayed. - [Stephanie] How? - The elders began to regret the ungodly pact they entered into. They to sent a team of witch hunters into the forest to kill Lilith and her circle. The witches were drowned. Their bodies buried. The earth was scrubbed with salt to ensure they would never arise again. May God forgive us. - Are you saying that those bodies, the ones we dug up, that those are the bodies of Lilith and her coven? - You asked for the truth, my dear! [ominous music] [fire crackling] And the question is, do you believe in witches? [ominous music] [fire crackling] [doors closing] - Okay, what do you make of all that? - I think the man's a nut loaf. [Stephanie sighs] He sort of reminds me of someone. - But do you believe his story? - I'm able to believe anything in this town. But hey, I'm only a tourist. - That's right. You are. What we need is the opinion of people. [static buzzing] - Sir, hi. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions about those grave sites they found outside of town? - [chuckles] Grave sites give me the, ooh, the willies. - I think I read something in the Metro section about that. - See a lot of tourists coming to this town. They stop me like you do and ask me questions because I got the late shift. - [Stephanie] Sir, can I have a moment of your time? - I really don't have time. - Nothing ever happens in this town. I mean, if something happened here, I wouldn't have to read comic books all the time to to get something to happen for me. - You don't wanna go in the woods. The woods, they'll kill you. - The first time I got laid was in those woods. - We're not from here. We're just visiting. - I'm from Buffalo. - This area has a history of peculiarness but that breeds mystery. - I'll tell you that I will never go back again. And it's got nothing to do with the girl that I was with. - And we were cleaning the woods and we were all kind of high and stoned and... - When I was finished, I felt this, I can't describe it. This weird cold sweat thing that happened. - [Stephanie] What about the kids that are missing? - I said, I don't have time, okay? - I know the father of one of the girls and he's upset. - The kids? Screw those kids. - [Stephanie] So do you think those kids were punished in some sort of way? - Probably. Maybe they were some of the kids who made fun of me and now maybe they went out in the woods and something got 'em. And good is what I say to that. - Well I haven't read that there was a connection between the bodies they found and the kids that were missing in terms of identification or anything. - [Stephanie] What can you tell me about the old house by the woods? - The witch house? - Oh, that house, it's haunted. Oh yeah. 'Cause I believe in it. - I've been up at that place before. Been inside. - Deserted houses get reputations as being haunted. - [Stephanie] What was it like inside? - Place is real strange. When we got in, it was all dusty and dark. And when I got in there, I was walking around. I heard, sounded like this old woman or something was laughing and stuff. Candle blew out, the door of the room slammed shut. - You know what? One time, my friend, Tommy, who he was my friend and we would buy comic books together, but he moved to Portland. He went up to the house. Some other kids dared him. I told him not to go. I stayed back and watched. - This cold hand like touched me. - He went up and he touched the door knob and he got a bloody nose. - [Stephanie] So you think you got a bloody nose because of the witches? - Well, he was a bleeder. - I've read records that in fact, the house was burned years ago and this is another house entirely. - And I stay away. You know why? 'Cause I'm a security guard. - No, you're not supposed to say our name because that makes her aware of you and then that can make you a target. - [Stephanie] Have you ever heard of Lilith LaFey? - That's biblical, isn't it or? - [Stephanie] Are you talking about Lilith LaFey? - Right, now you said her name and now, okay, now that we've said it, I guess we gotta talk about her. - That name sounds familiar. - Yeah, I think we saw them at Lilith Fair. - I don't know anything about him. - Lilith LaFey fucking rock! - Oh yeah, she's that goth chick. I think she's in 7 Months. - Yeah. - Yeah, well a lot of tourists come in and ask me about Lilith. I'm not scared of Lilith. - They have that song, you know? ♪ Yeah, I wanna rock your world ♪ It's so cool. - [Stephanie] So is Lilith an old wives' tale? Can you go into the woods, say her name three times and she'll appear? - You know, I wouldn't even say at once. Three times is asking for trouble. - I believe in certain paranormal stuff. Yeah, I mean, I read, you know. I see the "Psi Factor" and all that stuff. - I mean, you know, Lilith's not that tough, but I mean, she's killed a lot of people. - People hear about murders and witches and then they, well you wanna go investigate? I would investigate travel, a plane ticket somewhere else. - They existed. There's historical record of it. - No, but I believe in bitches. I've dated a lot of 'em. - Whether they were evil or not, you know, that's a matter of opinion. - There's gotta be validity in it. Otherwise, why do we keep repeating the same legends and stories over again? - I don't need to say anymore. - I gotta go. - Thank you. [static buzzing] [ominous music] [dog barking] [insects chirping] [doors opening] [seat belts clack] The witch house? - Well at least now we know why they're tearing it down. - Only happened to be the site of a mass murder. - I wonder if the city has it on their tourist information? [tape clacks] Maybe we could write them a letter. - [chuckles] God. [sighs] So where do we go from here? - Well, I am not looking forward to facing Sparrow with just a handful of half-baked ghost stories. - She did say to tell her about anything we found. Let's just hope they're having more luck than we are. [van starts] - Back to the slaughterhouse. [distorted whispering] [insects chirping] [branches rustling] [intense music] [distorted whispering] - Soon, my acolytes. Soon. [intense music] [Clark snoring] [door creaking] [Clark snoring] [ominous music] [Clark sighs] - Professor? What are you doing? - I wanted to apologize for my behavior this morning. I was out of line. - Um, that's all right. - Oh, but it's not all right. I wanna make it up to you. - Make it up to me? - Mm-hmm. I have a gift for you. - Oh no, I don't think this is such a good idea. - You do like me, don't you? Because I don't handle rejection well. [ominous music] - There is something about me you don't know. [tongue slurping] - What's that? - I'm gay. - That's okay. I have something else in mind. [intense music] [flesh squelches] [Clark screaming] Don't fight it. Relax. [Clark screaming] It's easier that way. [intense music] [Clark screaming] [intense music] Welcome back. We've got work to do, my friend. [floor creaking] - Angela? Angela? Did you hear that? - Hear what? - It sounded like someone was walking above us. - The attic? What would anybody be doing that for? - I don't know. - You know, you're probably just dreaming. - I don't think so. - [sighs] Look, believe me. It's your imagination, all right? Now go back to sleep. - I think I'll have a look around. - Fine, let me sleep. - Fine. [door creaking] [ominous music] [floor creaking] Hey, who's up there? [suspenseful music] [intense music] Wow. Mm. [chuckling] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Jodi laughing] Oh you, girl. You have got it going on. [Jodi humming] [Jodi laughing] [floor creaking] [intense music] Dammit, come out of there. I'm warning you. I'll scream, "Rape." [body convulsing] [intense music] [Jodi gasping] - "Vanity," says the preacher. [Jodi screaming] [glass shattering] [Angela gasping] [suspenseful music] [door creaking] - Jodi? [door creaking] Jodi, what's going on? [suspenseful music] [door creaking] Clark? [suspenseful music] [switch clicking] Clark? Shit. Where is everybody? [door creaking] [suspenseful music] Jodi? Clark? Professor Sparrow? Satan? Anybody? [suspenseful music] [Angela sighs] [intense music] [van approaching] [insects chirping] [doors closing] - [sighs] Home sweet home. - [Stephanie] At least they could have left a light on for us. - Yeah, Motel 6 this ain't. At least we don't have to face the professor tonight. [Angela chuckles and sighs] Look, somebody cares. - I am so glad to see you guys. - [Stephanie] Well what's the matter? - [sighs] Well, let's put it this way. If I was in one of those lame slasher movies, I would be so dead right now. - [chuckling] What are you talking about? - I can't find anybody. Jodi said she heard something upstairs in the attic, so she went up there to go check it out. But now everybody else has gone too. Oh, and some idiot decides he's gonna turn the stupid power off. - Maybe we should check the kitchen and see if any of the knives are missing. [both chuckling] - Ha, ha. I was gonna go check up in the attic, but then I heard you guys pull up. - Let's get inside and tell 'em the jig is up. - Well we'll need a light. - We can use the light on the camcorder. Norman? - Okay. Let there be light. I guess God is a woman after all. - That'll work. Everybody ready? - Ready as we'll never be. [door creaking] [door closes] - [Stephanie] Did anything unusual happen today? - No, not unless you wanna count the professor's shitty attitude. - That was pretty unusual. - Yeah. You know what she did, you guys? She totally locked us all out of the lab. I was working there up until everyone went to bed. - No one talked to her? - No. She said she didn't vant to be disturbed. - [chuckles] She seemed like - Ooh. - [Norman] an innocent professor but little did they know that she was really Satan, uh-huh. - [Stephanie] Norman, over here. It's empty. - Wait, that can't be right. - [Stephanie] What happened to the new samples you and Clark took today? - I don't know. I mean, I gave 'em to Professor Sparrow. - [Norman] You know, I can't believe I'm about to make this suggestion, but now might be a good time to give our friend Sheriff Creepy a call. [rotary dial clattering] [line clicking] Okay, this is the part where you tell us that the phone is dead. - What, it's dead? [phone clacks] - Next question. - Can I see a show of hands for staying in motel tonight? Anyone? [Angela chuckles] - Well, I'm gonna go upstairs. If the two of you wanna leave, I'll understand. - [Norman] Okay, see ya. I was only joking. - Real funny, asshole. - I can't believe you still have your stupid send of humor. - [Norman] I am just trying to get through this without pissing my pants, okay? - Oh, that's nuts. Let's all just get a grip. - [Norman] Oh shit, it looks like our luck is holding up. The battery is about to die, and we're gonna be losing light here real soon. [camera beeping] Aw. - Ooh. Uh, what is that odor? Ooh, what is it? - [Norman] Death. I'd recognize it anywhere. - What? - [Norman] The grave. Subject day, remember? - Oh, my gosh. It is the same smell. I mean, this is much stronger, but it's the same. [door creaking] - Over here. Norman, the light. [camera beeping] - [Angela] Oh my God! I didn't notice that before. - What the hell is that? - [Norman] Jesus, he could of at least taken a moist towelette to that when he was done. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh my gosh, look at that. [camera beeping] It's DNA sample, subject B. - [Norman] Ah, there's something warm running down my leg. - Norman, how long until the battery is dead? - [Norman] It could go at any minute, like us. [camera beeping] Wait, wait, wait! [camera whirring] - What? - [Norman] I thought I just saw something. - Where? - Down there! At the other end of the hall! - [Angela] I don't see anything. - [Stephanie] What do you think you saw? - [Norman] I'm not sure, just a shape. It might've been our own shadows. [camera beeping] [footsteps shuffling] [ominous groaning] - [Angela] [gasps] What is it? - [Stephanie] Can you see anything? - No. - Oh. [camera beeping] - [Norman] Jodi? [floor creaking] Is that you? - [Stephanie] Can anyone hear me? - [Norman] There's nobody up here, damn it. - [Angela] No wait, there has to be. Where did everybody go? - We heard someone. - No, we heard something! [camera beeping] - [Angela] Jodi? Clark? [shrieking] Professor? - [Norman] Look, there's nobody up here, dammit! - He's right. [breathes heavily] [ominous chanting] - Did you hear that? - What the fuck? [camera beeping] [ominous chanting] - Now it's coming from behind us! [ominous music] - [Norman] Yeah, I'm just saying we get the hell out of this house right now! - This time you've got my vote! - Me too, I wanna get the hell out of this house! [camera beeping] - Oh! - [Norman] Shit, the battery! - [Stephanie] Don't panic! It's just a house! [ominous chanting] [Angela screaming] - Did you hear that? - What the hell? [suspenseful music] [whooshing and whirring] [witches snarling] [witches roaring] For Christ's sake. [eyes zapping] - Don't insult me. [chuckles] [witches snarling] [intense music] [witches shrieking] - Let's get the hell out of here. [both gasping] - Visitors. How nice. I had almost forgotten about our merry little wanderers. - Let me guess. Lilith, right? - Ooh, my reputation proceeds me. - So does your odor. [Stephanie gasping] - Such revolt. [Lilith sniffing] Is that fear I smell? Before this night is over, you will be begging me to end your pitiful little existence. - What the hell are you up to? - Ooh, just a simple little recipe for revenge. [witches snarling] I think it's about time this town paid for what it's done to us. - You bitch! - Ooh, you say that as if it's bad thing. - You know, it's been really fun chatting with you, but we need to be going. - Is that so? Well let me help you with that first step. It's a real killer. [arms whooshing] [Norman screaming] - Norman! [hard rock music] [Norman groaning] [body rumbling] [Norman groaning] - Now for you, little girl. - Screw you! [Lilith hissing] [camera whacks] [hard rock music] - Norman? Norman? ♪ Changes in my life ♪ When I found you [witches cackling] [whirring] - [Lilith] Where do you think you're going? [hard rock music] - Assuming this bad horror movie scenario winds up with the van starting, you do have the keys, right? - Got 'em! [hard rock music] [doors close] [van starting] [tires screeching] [whooshing] [Lilith roaring] Okay, now what? - Go for help. This is Witchtown, USA. There ought to be someone who knows how to kill a witch. - Angus. - That man is certifiable. - He may also be our last hope. [hard rock music] Are you sure they're not following us? - Yeah, there's no one back there. I think the coast is clear. - Oh. [hard rock music] [Lilith snarls] [ominous music] [insects chirping] [knocking on door] [dog barking] Mr. Westmore? [knocking on door] Come on, it's open. - Nothing like that small town sense of security. - Mr. Westmore? [insects chirping] It's Stephanie Zinone and Norman Soderquist. We spoke to you earlier. Mr. Westmore, are you here? - It looks like he's out. Probably down at the bingo hall. - Look at this. - [Norman] The plot thickens. - It looks like one of the record books we researched at the library. - Yeah, what's it doing here? - Angus said his family were the ones who kept many of the town records, right? - Yeah, so the question is what's in here that he wants left out of the public eye? - It looks just like the others. Births, deaths. Oh, God. - What? - There's an entry here for Lilith LaFey. Born 1796, died 1826. Cause of death, drowning. - Oh, so he was telling the truth! - Now we know who kept the records. These are all people who were put to death for being witches. - What the hell went on in this town? [ominous music] - We chose to survive. - Sheriff Harmon. What are you doing here? - I live here - You what? - You figured out enough on your own. Guess it's about time you knew the whole truth. [ominous music] - Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you? - I don't understand. - This made it a lot easier for me to keep an eye on folks. - [Stephanie] I think it's about time we heard the real truth. - It's my job. It was my forefather, Isaiah Westmore, that oversaw the witch trials and sent Lilith and her coven to their graves. [sword scrapes] But you were digging them up. It was my job to prevent that from happening, but I failed. You see, Lilith and her coven, if they were to rise- - They have risen. [ominous music] - My God. No, this cannot be. - Trust me, it be. I have a lump the size of a grapefruit on the back of my head to prove it. [sword clinks] [ominous music] [fire crackling] - Then, it's over. - What is she up to? - When the witch hunters caught up with Lilith, she swore with her last breath that one day she would rise again and take a revenge on the people of Covington. - How? - The sickness. She'll recall the sickness. Only this time a hundred fold. Everyone will die. - I guess we should've finished her off when we had the chance. - Tell me, how was she resurrected? - We found an empty DNA sample on Clark's floor. They must've been injected somehow. Although, that doesn't seem likely since the sample we drew was degraded. - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Perhaps Lilith isn't quite as strong as she'd like us to believe. - In that case, we may still have a chance. We must completely destroy the remains before Lilith can complete her work. - But how? The only way to destroy what's left of their bodies would be with some type of- - Acid. [ominous music] - Let me guess. - Down in the cellar, right through that door. In my line of work, you have to be prepared. [Norman chuckles] [suspenseful music] [van approaches] Hurry, there's no time to waste! [intense music] Which one is Lilith? - I don't know. Let's start here. - Quickly! - Dude, I'm going as fast as I can! - All right, give me a hand. - Let me try. - Just tell me something. - What's that, young lady? [coffin lid creaking] - The book at your home. There must've been hundreds of entries. - 318, to be exact. - Where they really all witches? - They were all tried according to the laws of the day and made accountable. - That doesn't answer my question. - Stephanie, now is not the time! - A lot of those people may have been innocent. - What was done was done for a reason. - And it didn't matter that innocent people died? - It was the only way to make sure. - And look what it got you. All of you! [lid clattering] - Okay, let's go. [intense music] We won't be back. [acid spraying] [fire roaring] [witch shrieking] [whooshing] - What was that?

Down on your knees and I'll be quick and merciful. - How pathetic. Are you offering me a bargain? - I'm offering you mercy. - I don't need your mercy. - Your coven is gone. You're weak. And wherever you go, I'll find you. - You will die with the rest tonight. It is your cries for mercy which will be ignored. [whooshing] [Lilith laughing] - She's on her way back to the house to complete the spell. - We must follow her. We have no choice. - So let's go. [intense music] [owl hooting] [whirring] - It's over, Lilith. [Lilith snarling] - I've been expecting you. - I knew you would be. [intense music] - You're a fool. Just as your ancestor was. [whirring] It's too late. It's all been done. [sword clinks] [Lilith laughing] You can't kill me with that. - I know that too. [intense music] It took the blood of the guilty to recall this pestilence. Now the blood of the innocent must destroy it. [sword whooshes] [Lilith snarls] [sword whooshes] [flesh squelches] - No! [Lilith roaring] [Stephanie groaning] [flesh squelching] [whirring and whooshing] You crazy son of a bitch! [fist whacks] [intense music] [Stephanie coughing] [Stephanie groaning] [somber music] [Stephanie gasping] [Stephanie gasping] Just hold on. I'm gonna get you some help. It's gonna be okay. - She knows what needs to be done. Throughout history, it's been the blood of the innocent, to save the rest from evil. It was true 200 years ago and it's still so at this very moment. - You're a freak! - Please, I... [somber music] - You don't have to believe anything this guy's conned you into. [Stephanie gasping] You're not guilty of anything. You don't have to pay for these people's past. - What choice do I have? [Stephanie gasping] There's no place left to run.
