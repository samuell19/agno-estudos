Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad {\a6}Round 20 (Final Episode) Come on in. Are the broadcast preparations going well? Pretty much. You know when a poor household sets a table for a party, they borrow dishes, spoons and such from their neighbors. It's just like that. I was grateful to you for the other day. Jang PD, you are the first and last person to understand my past. No. Your scars, and the way you are now, I'm sure most people would understand. I would rather no one know. I'd like you to forget about it too. I have. Thanks. Jang PD, do you happen to like fishing? Fishing? I'm trying to catch a certain fish, but I don't have good enough bait. The fish is so clever, that he won't even look at most bait. I've thought about it, and I think you may know of a bait that fish may go after. By any chance, is the fish you're talking about, Nam Je Il? Yeah. I can't just walk away from the upcoming tournament. I've got to do it. A bait that would entice that clever fish. Do you have any ideas? Something that could work as bait... there is one thing. Really? Something Nam Je Il can accept from you, and something you can give to Nam Je Il... there's just one thing. Restoring his name. Restoring his name, you say. Matching him up against Maeng Do Pil again? There's been a new title established for an Asia Champion. Currently, Maeng Do Pil is the provisional Champion. I'm trying to get Jang Seok recommended to qualify as a challenger, I got permission from President Ishigawa. Isn't a little too harsh for his comeback match? If he gets his knee re-injured, it will be disaster. Do you think you'll be okay? If I did a comeback fight, I'd already been thinking that my opponent would naturally be Maeng Do Pil. Even if the result is that I don't ever go back in the ring, my opponent can only be Maeng Do Pil. But, even if the knee has recovered, we haven't even tested how much it could take with practice sparring. I'm going to take a trip to the intense training camp. Jang Seok. I want to complete my training there, so I'd like Head Coach and Coach Go to help me out. Hmmm. Well it's um... okay with me, but... Why are you all looking at me? What have I done so wrong that I have to go to intense training again? I've already gone 3 times. Are you really going to show that kind of lack of loyalty? Then, what? Shall I spar with Jang Seok? I want to fulfill my father's wish. So, just one last time... please help me. Geez, drives me nuts. Fine. Let's go. But, you lose to Maeng Do Pil... then I'll kill you myself. But the real problem is Kang Kyung Tak. Maeng Do Pil is the provisional Asia Champion, will he accept Jang Seok's challenge? Don't worry. He'll give me a condition and then accept the challenge. [Nam Je Il] What a coincidence. I was just going to call you. We want Maeng Do Pil as Lee Jang Seok's comeback opponent. Will you accept? A revenge match, huh? Isn't there too big a gap in their rank? Maeng Do Pil is the provisional Asia Champion. Lee Jang Seok doesn't even have a ranking. I'm inviting you to the banquet right now. But if you don't want to attend, I suppose there's nothing I can do. Fine. I'll accept. But, on one condition. I have something important to discuss. I'd like to meet with you. Then let's. Is it done? Mmm. President Kang has accepted. Thanks. This time, I will definitely take him down. Yeah. You can do it. Let's rest a little. Wow, how refreshing. This rampart here, this is Do Mool Po Japanese Rampart. In 1952 the Japanese Army that retreated from Seoul built this. Looking at it even now, they did built it good and strong, eh? What is you want to say? Do Pil might be stronger than this wall and hard to overcome. You've lost twice to him already. And this time, you're even recovering from knee surgery. This fight... could be the last fight of your life. Jang Seok, I'd like it if you didn't get hurt again. If the match gets too hard to endure... What the hell are you saying right now?! Are you suggesting throwing in the towel like last time?! This time, no way. You can't throw in the towel. Even if I die in that ring. That punk kid, I'm only thinking of him. It's been a long time since we've sat here like this. Let me pour you a glass. Please just make your point. This is the point. To let me pour you a glass. You don't get it? Nam Je Il, You won. I will restore it all. I'll clear away your muddied name. Money, power... I'll upgrade all of those from before and return them to you. Come back to Superstar Corp as President. I'll step back from operations a bit as Chairman. Are you trying to tempt me right now? That's right. I'm trying to tempt you. And your condition, I assume, is to bring with me the World Championship Tournament? Well that much you ought to bring with you to the table, no? Then, what are you going to do about the bad name you cast on me? I've already thought about that. Don't worry. You know me well. That I always pay people back for the scars they leave me. But instead, let's take each other's hand... and start over again. What do you think? It's not a bad offer. I have an offer as well. Tell me. What do you think of joining my company? Nam Je Il. Now that I'm living like a human, you want me to go back to the way it was? If I were ever to come back into this company, I will be... walking over you're already crumbled empire to do so. It will be easy? What do you mean? Nam Je Il did nothing wrong from the outset. He was just an obedient dog following my orders. Kang Ki Chang's big drug scandal, FF League's connection to organized crime. Nam Je Il was falsely accused. It never happened so we can easily rectify it. {\a6}Actually it was a little bit of work to put it all on him. You think you can do this and be safe? You think the President will just sit still? The highlight is what's next. Watch carefully. {\a6}...past power... However, the company is still responsible for the scandal. Jang PD, do you know how many employees our company has? There are a lot of employees we can pick to take the fall instead of Nam Je Il. Right, I think Manager Yang would be a good choice. Manager Yang Han Su? Isn't Manager Yang your right hand man? Sometimes you gotta chop off your right hand to save the company. He's someone I needed to get rid of anyhow as he's gotten worthless. And if I cut him, he's so pathetic, he couldn't come back at me like Nam Je Il did. This is your lord and master, Kang Kyung Tak. What do you think? I told you it was a matter that concerned your life. Now, make a decision. Are you going to go back, rat us out and just live like a dog? Or will you join forces with me and live like a man? Are you okay? Our Seok... is his training going well? Yes. Rep. Nam, our Seok will be fine even without me, right? Why say such a thing? You can beat this. Rep. Nam, Our Seok... take good care of him. He's no different than a blood brother to me. Don't worry. What's the matter? Nurse. Nurse! What happened. He lost consciousness. Doctor. Please save him. He has to see my match. He has to see me win! I'm sorry. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Jang Seok. I'll be back. I will absolutely win, so you have to rise again. If he wakes up, call So Yeon. All right. Don't worry about us here. You just go out there and win! Congratulations. Congratulations, Rep. Nam. From now on, don't ever stake your entire life savings. I thought I'd die of worry. No. If that kind situations ever arises again, I'm staking everything on you. Since you're the best gambler. You've prepared well. Rep. Nam Je Il, congratulations. I won't forget your kindness. This is all due to you. You really set the table nicely. It's someone else's table, but I'll enjoy the meal. Thank you. Thank you, I leave it in your hands. Rep. Nam. The two of you look like Cao Cao and Zhou Yu before The Battle of Red Cliff. Didn't Cao Cao's army of a million burn in a fire? That's what's going to happen. Then, all I have to do is pray for southeasterly winds? Right, do that. Okay. How's your knee? Yeah, it's okay. You can't get hit by a low kick. Hey, we think that would be nice too, but how can you not get hit by one in a match. He just has to be ultra careful. Like last time, he could continue to attack your knee, and while you protect the knee, he could attack somewhere else. Be careful of that. What about my dad? I'm gonna make sure he lives. If it can't be done in our country, find some other place. After the match, whether it's the US or Japan, or anywhere else, we'll fly there. All right. We now start the 2009 World Championship Special Match. This match will bestow the newly established title of Asia Champion. First in the blue corner, Maeng Do Pil makes his entrance! And in the red corner, Lee Jang Seok makes his entrance! Let me introduce both fighters, starting with the blue corner. Height, 183 cm, weight, 70 kg. Represented by Superstar Corp, Maeng Do Pil!! And over in the red corner, Height, 181 cm, Represented by Dream Gym, Jjangdol, Lee Jang Seok!! This is the 2009 World Championship Special Match between fighters Lee Jang Seok and Maeng Do Pil. Both fighters have entered the ring and introductions have ended. Today, after suffering a severe knee wound, Lee Jang Seok enters the ring again. You have to consider that he has an incredible fighting spirit. Yes, his fighting spirit is indeed incredible, but recovering from an injury is a difficult {\a6}And having lost twice to... Jjangdol, don't rush it, and be careful of your knee. Hey, no matter what, don't get in close with him in the first round, okay? You have to fight your way out of it. Send him in the 3rd round, hmm? You're ready right? If it gets too bad, signal. You have to. I'm going to ask you one final time. Even if I could die, don't throw in the towel. - Second out! - Here, ah! Second out! Round One! Fight! Lee Jang Seok is a fighter just recovering from a knee surgery. What do you think of today's fight, GM Jang Su Jin? I've heard that Lee Jang Seok has gone through extensive training. Yes. If he's just careful of that knee, I don't think he'll crumble very easily. Yes. However, Maeng Do Pil is a very strong fighter. That's true, Maeng Do Pil... Punch now, punch, punch! Good, good! Good!! Yes, you can see that Lee Jang Seok is showing more power. That's it! Low kick! Now a low kick! Maeng Do Pil is ultimately attacking that knee. After all, Lee Jang Seok had that wounded leg. Looking for low kick, but gets a high kick, and he goes down! Ah, that's a Brazilian kick. - Where you start attacking with low kicks, - One - and then spin around with a high kick. - Two, Three Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight... Yes, Maeng Do Pil sends Lee Jang Seok down first. - Fighting! - Fight! Break! Corner! You did good! The bell has sounded, and it looks like Lee Jang Seok has been saved by the bell at the end of Round One. I told you not to rush it! Hey, hey, if he comes in, let him have it! Is your knee okay? I told you, no problem! Second out! Focus, eh? {\a6}Second out! Round Two!! Fight! Right hook! He comes right back and takes him down in Round Two with an incredible right hook. Hard to believe that this Lee Jang Seok went down in Round One as he sends him down in one blow. You said that he would not crumble easily and that it wouldn't be an easy match, but he's looking really good and it's turning into a great match. Yes, Fighter Lee Jang Seok does have a legendary fist. Yes. The match continues. - Right hook! - He immediately returns the knock down. One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight... Maeng Do Pil is starting to go ahead. Fight! Go 'round, go 'round! Take him out! Maeng Do Pil's low kick, which made him famous in the Korean league! And there seems to be no end for Lee Jang Seok, another kick! Then right away... Maeng Do Pil throws him to the ground. Getting thrown like this, at the very least, Lee Jang Seok's spirit must be crushed. Yes. He looks weak after that last exchange and the knee wound is worrisome. After all, getting wounded in the leg like that is like an eagle getting it's wings clipped. Yes. Fight! Break! Jang Seok. This isn't working. Jang Seok, let's let it go. Yeah, if you get hit anymore, it'll be hard for you to even walk. No, no way. Jang Seok, you have become champion. Huh? Are you okay? If his opponent completely crumbles, he goes after a KO and throws a big hook. That's when you go for the close encounter. Second out. I promised my father. That I wouldn't fall apart ever again. Be strong. Fighters center! Jang Seok, Fighting! Fight! Oh, it looks pretty hard to endure. He takes him down hard! ...Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven... Good! Good! That's it! Lee Jang Seok gives the knock-down right back in this round. ...Eight, Nine... Down! One, Two, Three, Four... Immediately another knock down, Maeng Do Pil is down. What's going on? Lee Jang Seok has exited the ring. Yes. Oppa! Resume fighting! Ahjussi. Ahjussi! What's wrong? This is the first time anything like this has happened. Yes. If he doesn't return to the ring, he will be disqualified. This is critical. The count seems to be continuing. But since this is the first time... Yes. Where is Lee Jang Seok headed... I... I said I'd keep my promise. So Ahjussi, you get up soon too. Jang Seok. Hey Seok, my poor kid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Seok. - Jang Seok Oppa. - Oppa, what's wrong with Ahjussi? Ahjussi! Jang Seok Oppa, what's wrong? Ahjussi! Ahjussi, wake up! You can't do this to Jang Seok Oppa! Father. Father. Father, Father. Father! Father. Father! Father!! Father! Father, please. Get up! Father. Father! Did you just say you were going to return the Asia Championship Belt? I lost that match. The decision is made by the judges, not the fighter. Lee Jang Seok didn't return to the ring and was disqualified. Why are you doing this? It's not like you. That's not so. My time here at Superstar Corp was when I was not like myself. I'm departing. Departing? Even when your next match is against the World Champion? I have no right to be champion. You've totally lost touch with reality. No. I've found it again. Are you guys here to say you're leaving with him? Since, our leader has returned, it's only natural we go back. I see. Because Nam Je Il has made a comeback, huh? All right. All of you, get out of my sight. You will come to forever regret your actions today. Nam Je Il, let's see how far you go. Get some sleep. My father probably went to hell, right? Since he did a lot of bad things. No. In the end, he lived for you. He's probably in a good place. I guess I'm really an orphan now. You have us. I'll show you, that even if we don't share a drop of blood, we can be family. There's not much time before the broadcast. He'll come. You have one more guest. The first bit of news is a Sports Panorama Exclusive. We've uncovered some shocking news about our recent guest on Direct Hit Interview, President Kang Kyung Tak of Superstar Corporation and the Korean K-1 Unified Association Please take a look at this video. ...forced one of your employees to sacrifice himself... I suppose the big Kang Ki Chang drug incident is what you're referring to. {\a6}[Superstar Corp President Kang Kyung Tak,] {\a6}[The Shocking Truth!! Nature of Falsehoods and Hypocrisy!!] Nam Je Il did nothing wrong from the outset. He was just an obedient dog following my orders. Yes, President? Where is Manager Yang? His phone is off too. Yes, I'll find... President! What is it? On TV, there's a story about you on Sports Panorama right now! What are you talking about? More than for my personal profit, I'm a man that is constantly working for the development of sports in this country. {\a6}[President Kang Kyung Tak's Hypocrisy!] President Kang Kyung Tak in order to get an athlete's weakness, {\a6}[Previously associated with Superstar Corp] always ordered background investigations. {\a6}[Previously associated with Superstar Corp] I... hired suitable employees and had them do the work. {\a6}[Previously associated with Superstar Corp] And duplicate bookkeeping system for lobbying {\a6}[Previously associated with Superstar Corp] exists somewhere as well. {\a6}[Previously associated with Superstar Corp] {\a6}[Previous World Champion] End Lee Jang Seok's life as a fighter... he made that order twice. Because of the President's order, I had no choice, but I ask for the forgiveness of Lee Jang Seok and the fans, and I will retire. {\a6}[Electrifying declaration of retirement] [President Kang Kyung Tak's Savage Nature Shocks Entire Nation] [Kang Kyung Tak!! A Sports Empire Built on Lies and Hypocrisy] [Even the K-1 Fighting Unified Association Was Planned to be Sold Overseas!!] [Superstar Corp Stocks Fall to the Floor!!] Flowers! Oh, I really missed you. I so wanted to see you, my flowers! Me too, me too, me too. I'm sorry. I won't leave you again. I'm really sorry we left you lonely during that time. We thought of you all the time in our part-time jobs. I'll make you delicious coffee for life. Can't I marry you, Sam Soon? Oh my, oh my! Marry him, marry him, marry him! That was a spectacular close encounter, Nam Je Il. This is why I never trusted women. Showing you my true self, Jang PD, turned out to be a huge mistake. I'm sorry, but there was no other way we could have found any cracks in your armor. Right. I suppose not. What will you do now? Jessica has suggested we take the Unified Association and the company all to the US. If you hand it over, K-1 fighting will crumble in Korea. If you don't sell it, the company will go to ruin. It appears it's a checkmate. It's become that way. We've come from the prosecutor's office. Please give me a moment. Nam Je Il, I've thought about it. You are quite a capable agent. Do you remember what I said before? I told you I wanted to make you President. You said it was a company that you gave all the young years of your life to. Take over Superstar Corp and the Unified Association. That's better than having it taken over by a foreign enterprise. And... I won't die. I'll start over. Let's go. Yes. Wow, what kind of theater has a place like this? Why did we come to such a fancy place? It's the most important day of my life, so don't make a fuss and just do what I say today, eh? I'll serve the main course now. Yes. - Wow. - Wow, that looks good. Right, my daughter. Eat up. Okay, everyone, get ready. I'm starting. Can you see me? Can I start? Yeah, it's great. Start. Why doesn't it start? Hey. But why are we the only ones here? Honey, I never became champion, but from now on I'll be a champion husband and a champion dad. So, won't you marry me now? What? What if you get old and die without ever having a wedding? It's So Yeon. Sister-in-law, uh, you'd probably look really pretty in a wedding dress. Auntie Geum Ja, I'll give a lot of congratulatory money for the wedding, so please marry him. I'm against this wedding. Just split up. That little... I'm just kidding. Coach Go Gwang Pal, despite your looks, in your heart, you're a Flower. Please get married and live happily. Honey. You'll marry me, won't you? Marry him, mom. Okay. Mmm. Thanks. Let me introduce Superstar Corp's new Director of Strategic Planning, Park So Yeon. I'm Park So Yeon. I look forward to working with you. Yes? A call from the Busan Police Department. Police Department? Please connect them. Hello? Yes. This is Nam Je Il. Jang Seok as a policeman? Yes. I heard the story of fighter Lee Jang Seok from the Kijang Governor. I heard that even though he went through some dark times growing up, it was his dream to be a policeman. Yes, that's right. I felt that it might provide hope to young boys' and girls' dreams so I put in a report. For now, I received permission to employ him specially as a martial arts coach for policemen. Thank you. Police? That's right. That works out well. As it was, I was worried about you returning as a fighter with that knee. That really sounds like a dream. It isn't a dream, right? Congratulations, Officer Lee. If my father were alive, he'd have really liked that. He probably would have liked it better than you becoming champion. Ah, Jang Seok. Go somewhere with me. Where? To see your mother. Your father also... knew since long before. I think he didn't want to shatter her happiness. And if you knew, he worried that you may be more heartbroken, so he continued to lie. She's pretty. Just like in my dreams. It's a relief. I was worried that she was living a hard life somewhere. It's truly a relief. Father, you're quite a fool. How did you let such a pretty mom get away. Are you comfortable? Mmm? Mmm. Very comfortable. Thanks, for building me such a nice spot in a sunny place. Father, my mother looked really pretty. Is that right? Yeah that's right. She was pretty. Hey Seok... I'm sorry. Shhh. Father, I won't go look for my mom anymore, so meet someone nice in the heavens. Someone prettier than mom. Jjangdol Hyungnim! Small fry! You've grown a lot. Ah, I thought you were a real policeman. Ohhh. Where'd you pilfer that suit? I really am a policeman. Eh? - Hello! - Hello! Have you guys been well? Yes! Your last game... I heard you lost a shutout. Huh? I was so disappointed, I didn't bring any presents. The presents are back here, kids. Wow!! You have to win next time, okay? Okay! Whoa, now you're really looking like a policeman. Welcome Officer Lee Jang Seok. Come on out. Who's this kid? Our youngest small fry. I wanna try out baseball on him. Really? Have you played baseball before? He hasn't, but he can run like nobody's business. He's probably faster than Lee Jong Beom* even with his feet tied. {\a6}*Korean Pro Baseball player. If he gets training, he could probably be a Major League stolen base king. He's that good? Hey small fry. Yes? Do you want to steal wallets or bases from now on? Bases. Here, try this on. Come over here. Stand over on that line. Okay, pick up one of those balls. Give it a throw. Okay. Aim here. Oh nice! Oh, very nice! He should be a pitcher instead of a stolen base king. Huh? He's even more surprising than you, Jjangdol, when I discovered you. Let me sign him. Okay, it's coming. Right here! Very nice. Hurry and cut it, Manager Oh. Here, have some more meat. Oh, but I'm full. I ate too much. We ate a lot. Maybe we could have some tasty coffee. Shall we? Uh? Then since it's So Yeon's birthday, I'll mix hers. Cappuccino or Cafe Latte? Cafe Latte. Cafe Latte. What about mine? Whatever. Here. Here, President Nam. Thank you. Good? It's good. It's cuz I made it. Manager Oh, come and have some coffee. Manager Oh, stop grilling and come have some coffee. Yes. Hey, why did you want to have your birthday party at this hellish intense training site. I have really bad memories of this place. For me, it's not hellish, but like heaven, where our dreams were fulfilled. Yeah, it's what got us to where we are now. Gave us our roots. This is pretty much heaven. Then hell has become heaven! But why didn't the flowers come? Oh my! Here's the flower. Not the old flower, the young flowers. Our flowers say they don't even want to look at this place. Looking at you now, you look just like a parrot. How'd you know? I hear that a lot! Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you... Here, let me take a picture. So Yeon! Sorry. What's happening? Hey! He's probably doing okay, right? My dad. Of course. From up in the sky, he's probably always praying for you. If he saw me become a policeman, he would have been really happy. Yeah. He would have been proud. Even more than if you had become champion. My dream... I really didn't know it would come true. Anyone can dream. Not everyone can make them come true. If you just think about them, they're sweet. But the closer you get to that dream, you see it's soaked in blood and sweat. So no matter how small the dream is, making it come true is brilliant. Rep. Nam, your dream was to be hit by a lightning bolt of money. Have you fulfilled your dream? No, my dream has changed. You have a different dream? Mmm. What is it? It's something. What is it? I told you there's something. Hurry up and tell me. A complete family. A complete family? With who? So Yeon and you. The 3 of us living together. Uh, what's that? How can the three of us live together? You can live with me as my little brother, and... So Yeon... Rep. Nam. No way. You can't. Don't even dream about it. That's my dream. Why can't I, kid? What's yours? Little... Both of you, wake up from your dreams. You think I'm crazy, to live with a problem son? As far as marriage goes, you two can get married. What are you talking about the two of us? That's a relief. Let's live together, Rep. Nam. What are you doing? C'mon, Hyung, let's live together. You're giving me the creeps, kid. So Yeon... C'mon, Hyung, let's live together. What's wrong with you, creeping me out? So... ahhh. Stop playing... let's live together, Hyung. Let go, let go... Didn't you say you slept well when you sleep next to me? When did I say next to you... Why be like that you guys? Let's go. You did... C'mon, let's...
