UNTIL THE BIRDS RETURN Hello. Teaching today? I had a meeting, but it's always the same. Coming shopping with me? And the principal? I don't care, I retire soon. They won't fire me now. I wanted a word about Nassim. Coming? Since you got his motorbike, he's quit school. You should have asked me. I hate seeing him on it. But you're so stubborn. I knew he wanted one... I just couldn't resist. Maybe he won't be a doctor. No, don't let him hear you say that. He must finish what he's started. Tell him that. Ok, don't get angry. Work something out, but he simply can't quit his studies. - How's your new wife? - Fine. She's looking for work. She's starting to feel lonely. I'm often away. Hello. Two kilos of potatoes, please. All right. How can she be bored in that big house? There's so much to do. I didn't say bored, I said lonely. How's your work going? I spend all my time on a big project. What is it? A hospital, but nothing's final. Why not? I have competitors. How much? DA 140. Sorry, DA 160. Sorry, I don't have change. Me neither. It's your problem. Forget it. I have other stuff to buy. I'll come back. Take your time, ma'am. You're here? Hello, Dad. How are things? Fine. And you? Fine. Where were you? With friends. I just came to get my jacket. I'll go to see him. You won't stay for dinner? I will. In a hurry? Yes, they're waiting outside. Can we talk for a minute? You want to talk about my studies. I want to understand. Do you know what you're doing? I know medical studies are long and hard. You have no time to see girls. Your mother worries about you. You have no plans. I'm sick of it. I don't want to be a doctor. I'm wasting my time. I've no motivation. You have to find motivation. Nothing is easy in life. Get your diploma. Two years isn't a lot. After, do what you want. Music, a tattoo... Don't exaggerate. Eating with us? I don't think so. I'll eat at Hakim's. What's he up to? Nothing. Did you talk to him? Yes, we talked. I said to think rather than regret later. I persuaded him. Rubbish. I just hope he isn't going to wreck five years of studies. Is it settled? If I have time, I'll stop by. What's wrong? Reading the paper depresses me. So stop reading it. Everything is at a standstill. Nothing will change. Never mind. Nothing lasts. But when will it change? You want things to change or evolve? How do you manage not to blow a fuse? If you can't understand the world, it's better to focus on distant times. Even if they're harmful? I didn't create them. I'm sick of waiting for change. Have you seen all the idle young people? I'm sad to see all that potential wasted too. Sometimes, I think they're after something else. Understand? You loved to roam the streets too. You used to say, "I want to walk. Walk to understand." Remember? The other day, I saw a youngster on the street. He smiled at me. As if to say something. To say he felt good. Why is that surprising? He's usually leaning on the wall. I'd never seen him smile. And then, for the first time, I saw him do it. Because he's not local. Or people don't know him. Maybe. It's not that simple. Why not put these books away? It's such a mess here. I was really hungry. Sorry it took so long. It cooks slowly. - More? - No, thank you. It was very good. - Shit. - What is it? I forgot to call Rasha. She doesn't know you're here? No. I've screwed up now. Thanks for coming. Only natural. - Keep on at Nassim. - I'll call you. You're his father, he'll listen. All right. Diversion Hello, Djalil? Hi. Why are you in the dark? Everything ok? You said you'd call. Sorry, I totally forgot. You worked a lot? Not really, no. So what did you do all day? I saw Lila. At her place? You never said. Is that why you forgot to call? She wanted me to talk to Nassim. You were upstairs when she called this morning. Can't I see my son? Don't get so angry. You've kept me waiting before. I'm just a bit tired. I had trouble with the car. I left it at a garage. I took a taxi home. I need to sleep. I'm beat. Hello. Your car is ready. We just changed the tyre. - It's outside - Thank you. Your bill. Add the newspapers. Hello. How are you? - You ok? - Fine. - And you? - Fine. - We waited yesterday. - Forgive me. My car broke down. It took all night. Any news? Not yet. He's waiting for our offer. As usual. But this time, he wants 15%. 15%? He's mad. You thought he'd sign the contract without taking a cut? You want useless contracts all your life? I've no idea. Usually, it's less than that. And you know my position. It's getting serious now. I don't understand why he chose us. We don't exist for him. Not a shred of respect. And now he likes us? It's fishy. You follow the project, that's all. I'll handle the rest. When? Which hospital? Thank you. Good job, it's not too serious. He was lucky. Not like those women. You see them? Their brother's in a coma. He was beaten up and left by the road. When? - What road? - I don't know. Did they say where? What's the matter? Here, I have to answer. I'll go and see Nassim. Wait, Lila. I need to talk. Is it urgent? Yes, it's urgent. Go on, tell me. Yesterday, on my way home, it was really dark. I took a road... where there was... a diversion. So what? I saw two men. They were beating a guy to a pulp. Where was this? Near S'haoula. It was dark. I hid. You didn't call the police? I wanted to, but I was scared they'd hear me. They left the guy in a pool of blood. I drove off. Near S'haoula? You thought he was the man in the coma... Don't worry, he's been here two days. But you... after... you didn't call the police? Where did you go this morning? A job interview at the DEC. That's great. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to last night, but you went to bed. I'm sorry. How long till you get an answer? I already have it. Already? What did they say? I don't match the desired profile. What? Never mind. It's all such a drag. I won't apply here again. What are you implying? I want to go back to France. I don't want to stay. It was a mistake trying to settle here. When did you realize that? You know it's been bad a while. I don't understand how things work here. It's complicated. Nassim had a motorbike accident today. What? When? This morning. I was at the hospital to see him. This morning and you tell me now? You tell me only now? How is he? He was lucky. Just a broken arm. You see now why I can't stay. You've made no room for me. Hello. Hello, Djalil. Sorry I'm late. No worries. I'm busy today... so you may go. - But don't hesitate. - Ok. Can I take three days off? Three days? We have work! I know, but a neighbour asked me to take him to Biskra. He's marrying his daughter there. He helped me for the apartment. - It'll be ok? - Of course. I have work and I feel like driving. Drive safely. When are you back? In two days. You have to take them? I'll be alone. What else can I do? Still, you'll be in good company. See you. Hello. Hello, my son. Can you bring the car closer for the girls? Of course. Let's go. Taking the old road? We'll avoid the work on the motorway. What's wrong now? Maybe a police roadblock or an accident. - What is it? - I'll buy water. - I'll go. - I want to walk. Don't be long. Welcome. Hello. Please sit. Thank you. We're in a hurry. What's ready? We have kebabs, chicken and fries. Chicken for me. Take their orders. - The restroom? - That way, sir. The same. Nothing, thank you. Kebabs, fries and a litre of water. Well, girls? Everything ok? - Tired? - A little. Thank you. You got the same? You're not eating? - Why not? - I'm not hungry. This isn't chicken. It's a duck... crossed with a goat. Before, chickens were all free-range. They sang. Djalil? How much further? About 300 km. If traffic's light, we'll arrive around 7 pm. You know this road? I came long ago. - Were you driving? - No, not at all. Been driving long now? I got it... during my national service. - Your licence? - 10 years ago. Passed or bought? No buying in the army. - Know the area? - A little. I used to come here, but this is new. It used to take six hours to get there. But the road is good now. It's cleaner. Aïcha, come with me. - What's wrong? - I don't feel well. I'll see you there. Hello, doctor. How is he? He's on an IV, but still vomiting. Food poisoning. What did he eat? We ate on the road. I think he had chicken. We've had twenty cases. Two fatal. It's an epidemic. Careful what you eat. Thank you. I feel better. Why do I have to spend the night? - How's Nadjla? - Ok. She's with Aïcha on the women's side. She's better, but he's under observation. Where will you spend the night? We'll find a hotel. - Can't you stay? - I already asked. They need the beds for patients. I don't want Aïcha left alone. There are fishy people around. Don't worry. I'm here. We have to go. Visiting hours are over. Are you ok? Get two rooms and be here early tomorrow. Don't worry, we'll be here. For the hotel. Djalil? I'm counting on you. This one seems ok. I'll go and see. This is the third already! You want to sleep outside? - Your father wants a decent hotel. - Just tell him that. Two rooms, please. Fill out these forms. Are you related? Is dinner at 7:30 ok? All right. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I was bored. - You should have called me. - I can walk alone. Here? What's wrong? Stop following me! Why are you here? Why? I'm driving you. It had to be you? Your father had no one. I couldn't refuse. I know your game. What game? - What game? - Leave me be! You still go out as often? A little... Not like before. I work. I heard. What a chatterbox. I don't want to talk. That's new. People change. That's true. Who'd have thought I'd take you to your husband? Who'd have thought? Never mind. Let's sit down. No one's here. That's ok. Do you serve drinks? We've been closed a while. But I can offer you... - Coffee and water. - Thank you. Staying long? A week, ten days. It depends on Dad. And the religious wedding? Not yet. It's why we're here. And for the civil wedding. Congratulations. Don't make fun. I'm not making fun. What's he like? Why are you interested? You still have it. What? The bracelet. Cool. Here you go. Thank you. How did you meet him? Through my cousin. She arranged it. I wanted it. He's a good man. Not like me. The coffee's good. Because you're drinking it with me. Look. They're not ours. You can't! What's wrong? Let her take some. Go ahead, sister. - Sorry. - No worries. More. Thank you, brother. Help yourself, brother. I'm ok. Whatever. Goodbye. You give our pomegranates away? Why not? She didn't even ask permission. That girl lacks manners. She only took two. She didn't fill a basket. What does that change? Isn't that what they say here? "The field contains the traveller's share." The other way round, they'd have given you nothing. Maybe. Who knows? When we work this land, nature is generous. It doesn't care if we're good people or not. But it's our land. Why is it ours and not other's? We just have the use of it. But it doesn't belong to us. But it is my land. And I can prove it. Show me the document that says so. Nature doesn't say if it's our ancestors' or others'. That'll have to change one day. Where do you get ideas like that? Sorry, I forgot my bag. Are you angry? Forgive me. What is this? I don't know. A reception hall? Let's go and see. No one's here. Let's go, then. No, let's stay. - What do you want? - The same as you. Remove it now. I keep it to recall a friend. - Want it back? - No, it's yours. A souvenir of a pathetic guy. Can we change the music? - It's all I have. - Nothing to dance to? There are musicians over there. But they're on their break. Ask them. Be right back. You talked them round. Shall we dance? No, certainly not. You want to be alone? I'm fine with my drink. As you want. Everything ok? We haven't eaten. Never mind. It's ok, we'll take them. Nadjla. - Come and have coffee. - No, I have to go. Spend the night. The road isn't safe. - You're right. - It's wiser. There's a hotel on the road. - No, thank you. - Don't make me angry. Thank you. I won't forget. Goodbye. - Drive safely. - Goodbye. - Wait for me, please. - No worries. Looking for something? I'm meeting someone. It seems important. Can you tell? Yes. Is it him, there? Yes. You want to leave with him? It's complicated. I can't go on like this. Do you know what you're getting into? - Will you help me? - What's wrong? It won't start. Maybe the battery or the plugs. Let's go. I'll push too. No need, put it in second gear... Ignition and no handbrake. Hi. I'm on my way. I'm going to my uncle's. No, not tonight. I'll be tired. It's a long drive. I'll see you tomorrow at the café as usual. All right. There. Thank you. And your promotion? It's a matter of days. My colleague is retiring. The director promised. A month at the most. But you've told me the same thing for six months now. The wedding isn't far off. Yes, I know, uncle. He should have left long ago. It's hard for him to leave. He says it's a bad time. He'll leave soon. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Thank you. You're welcome. Have you bought furniture? Next week. Could I possibly speak to Radia? I'd like to see her too. She's gone with her mother to the village. If she had been here, we'd have cakes. Hello. - Is the director alone? - He's expecting you. Come in. Hello. Hello, Dahman. - You sent for me? - Indeed. Sit down. The Constantine seminar is at a bad time. I'm too busy here to attend. It clashes with the Minister's visit. I'd like you to go instead. I'd be glad to help out. Thank you. I've already let them know. Don't worry. Very good. Is that all? That's all. Kamel! - How are you? - Fine. What'll you have? The usual. - Are you well? - Yes, thank God. - I didn't disturb you? - Not at all. I'm in a rut right now. So, tell me. Three months there, three here. Between here and the South. Is it going well? The money's good, but it's exhausting. At night, I return to base exhausted. I'm alone in the job, without a partner. Don't you want something closer to home? I do, I've applied to several companies. But it's not easy starting over again. When did you get back? Last Sunday. I'm glad to see you. Your call surprised me. And the guys? They haven't changed. Actually, I have something to tell you. Go ahead. I don't know where to begin. You know you can tell me anything. I can keep a secret. It's about you. Last week, I saw my sister and my brother-in-law. It's about you, during the civil war. Your brother-in-law knows me? Yes, I've often told him about you. I have to tell you there are rumours about you. What? A woman moved into the shantytown near my sister's. They gave her a hut, but no one has seen and spoken to her since. Her door and windows stay closed. People felt sorry for her, so they gave her food and clothes. One day, she confided in a neighbour. Who then told everyone. What did she say? She spoke about when terrorists captured her. And? She talked about a gang rape. I still don't understand. She's looking for one of her rapists. But why me? She says you were there. She's mad! She said I was with them? She must mean some other guy. When she told her story, she gave your name. You've done nothing wrong? Of course not. You know what happened. They took me to treat them and I fled. Would I have done such a thing, Kamel? I swear to God I did nothing. You should clear this up. No way, I don't know her! To halt the rumours, you must talk to her. You understand? Where does she live? Well, Salah? Hello, doctor. You're leaving? Thanks to you. God preserve you. You're welcome. You have a ride? Yes, my son's waiting outside. Next Thursday, we expect you for dinner. Sorry? Next Thursday, you're my guest. God willing. Take care. We're here if you need us. Hello. How are you? - How do you feel? - My head hurts. - Still dizzy? - Yes. Be patient. We keep the medication. It'll be fine. Hello. Hello, Brahim. You're late. I was delayed on the way. And your trip? Tiring. There and back in one day. You saw your cousin? No. But my uncle, yes. And? Lamia, I'm done. Is Réda here? He just arrived. - Need anything? - No, thank you. - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. That's her house. Call me when you're done. Sit down. I nearly didn't recognize you. Do you want coffee? No, thank you. I won't stay long. Have we met? You've forgotten? I don't know you. I don't recall. You live alone? With my brother. I didn't expect to see you today. I don't understand... You came here to find me? It was hard finding you. The town you live in. You really don't recognize me? Sorry, I don't. - You think I'm someone else. - No. I recognize you. I've been looking for you for months. I came here to find you. I don't know anyone here. Except for a neighbour. What did you tell her? Don't worry. I told her you weren't like the others. But... I'm dreaming! You know I'm innocent, yet you accuse me? You could have stopped them. They forced me along as a doctor. What could I have done, but get myself killed? Who told you? My neighbour or someone else? Never mind. Such a grave matter and you tell just anyone? Nothing's grave. You're being too dramatic. Too dramatic? You're getting on your high horse. What happened to you? You're still alive, right? Do you remember that night at least? I've changed. That's why you don't recognize me. But I remember it all. You saw them take me over to the hut. Our eyes met as they dragged me over. After they abused me... I was trembling so much I couldn't breathe. Fear had overcome me. I was young. I thought they'd kill me, but they spared me. But they planned to do it again. Imagine how you feel when you think you're about to die. I saw myself dumped by a road or outside a village. I thought of my parents... of their sadness. Of my mother and my life. I kept saying, "I don't want to die." I didn't know I loved life so much. After they left, I was in shock for a long while. I was so scared they'd come back. But I was glad because they had spared me. That was all that mattered. I understand you went through hell. But why accuse me? I didn't do anything. I beg you, stop causing trouble for me. My life is complicated enough. I'm not here for that. I need you to help me. Help you? There's a child here? My son. I'm here for his sake. How does that concern me? I don't know him. I spent months in the maquis. You had already left. You left that evening? I was angry that you left me. When the army came to comb the region... the others fled and left me behind. The soldiers realized I was pregnant. The baby was already big in my belly. It was too late to abort. He was already moving. I could feel him. He helped me bear that hell. Him and you. Without you knowing. I clung to the memory of your gaze. He needed... and still needs me. Then things got complicated. At home, my parents rejected me... and the child. I have my brother. He wants to help me but can't. I went to the town hall to declare him in my name. They refused. They said it wasn't allowed. I have to find the father, if he's alive. They know my story. How can I tell who the father is? And me? What can I do? You can recognize my son. What? - I give him my name? - Yes. Give him your name. If they ask, I'll say we met during the war. He can't live without a name. He'll have no future. You're mad! You said I wasn't involved. So why? Fear not. I just want him to have a name. Sorry, but I can't. I can't. What are you afraid of? People thinking you had a child with me? You're threatening me? Be careful. If you spread these lies, you'll regret it. Not so loud. You've scared him. Why does he cry like that? I don't know. He was born that way. He has never talked. Listen... As a doctor, I can examine him. But, remember, if you cause me problems, I'll answer for nothing. What can you do? I'm not afraid anymore. You've been warned. First of all, I'd like to thank our sponsor CEC for helping us to organize this seminar. CEC is represented today by Mr Mourad Abdallah, who is here with us. CEC has won the project for the construction of the new regional hospital. Thank you all. We'll try to keep this short... During the study, scientists drew up a protocol to block TPA interaction with the receptor... Hello. Coffee, please. An interesting talk, but too theoretical. Not enough statistics. Sorry, I'm not a doctor. I thought you were. You work here? I'm here for the seminar. I'm a neurologist. That's interesting. Maybe you could help me. Go ahead. Sometimes, when I'm driving, there's a veil before my eyes. When I wake in the morning, my eyes are red. See an ophthalmologist. It could be cataracts. I shouldn't say this, but I don't like doctors. Maybe it's brain cancer? No, cancer is... quite rare. Those symptoms aren't enough to suggest cancer. What are the symptoms? There are a lot. Headaches, nausea... Even with all that, we don't talk of cancer without a scan. A scan? Believe me... An ophthalmologist will put your mind at rest. Thank you. It's on me. Goodbye and good luck. Don't worry. Where's the woman who lives here? She isn't here. Where is she? I must talk to her. I don't know. When I woke, she was gone. She didn't take her son? She isn't here, understand? Hello, Radia? Did I wake you? No... I wanted to hear your voice. I miss you too. Hello. Hello. Is she here? No, but she'll be back soon. I'll wait in the car. You can wait inside. Come in. Sit down. What's your name? My name's Dahman. You won't talk to me? Where's your mum? Where's Tahar? Over there. He hates being touched. Subtitles by Ian Burley Subtitling by HIVENTY
