INSEPARABLE Why don't you want to hire young people? - Come on, stop your bullshit. Move away! - Why won't you let us in? Come on, be nice, it's the same every time . - I said move away. You can't enter the store in gangs, you know that. I'm keeping an eye on it. - What gang? - Did you hear what he said? We don't want to enter your store, we're looking for a job. You have no right to deny us entry. - That's it, stop fucking around. Shut up! - No, what's your problem? Not bad, yeah? - We got kicked out again. - You shouldn't go there with Graf. He's been kicked out of there a lot. - That's true. - I told the bastard not to come in! - Nothing to do with me, as soon as we're in a gang, they won't let us in. - Two of you are a gang? Seriously? You're stuffed. You just have to move on. - Are we going to the marketplace? - No, we have to go back to the centre. It's lunchtime. You'll get caught otherwise. - What about the janitor? - He's scared to death, fuck him. - When I wanted to teach you tightrope-walking, you didn't want to know. You could have made some money by now. - Yeah you're right, I can see myself now in a sequinned costume! I'd look like a fag. - You should try acrobatics. That's a man's work. - He couldn't, his arse weighs 3 tons. - Button it, wanker, or you'll get squashed. This guy was born in a circus, easy for him. - Will you show me the backflip against the wall? That was great! - Backwards— And forwards! - Petia! Petia! Shit, he's not breathing! - Why do you want him to breathe? He's dead! - Yes, he's breathing. I don't want you to die! I don't want you to die! - Stop, you'll kill him for real! - It's my fault, I told him to jump. - Hey man, I'm okay. - You see, I didn't run away, I stayed. - What's going on? - I don't know, Petia hurt himself. He doesn't look good. - It's not my fault. - He's such a pussy it's untrue! Seriously! Since he arrived, he's been in the infirmary more often than in his bed. - It's not my fault. - Sissy! - Fuck off, Graf! - You knew he wasn't going to die. So why were you scared? Every time it's like talking to a wall. You do it on purpose? Henri, yes, I've booked a court. No matter if there are four of us, we can play doubles. - Feel better? Did you take your meds this week? You know you mustn't stop your treatment in case you have an attack. - I think I stayed too long in the sun. - Yeah sure. Everyone knows the 6pm sun is bad for your health. All right, I'll get you a tray from the canteen. Watch out Thierry! Move slowly, gently. Gently! Out! - He hadn't left the tunnel. It looked like he was waiting for me to bite me. - I don't understand why he's so aggressive. I checked him from every angle. Clinically there's nothing, I'm sure. - Well, we need to do something, because there's going to be an accident. Marie, what are you doing? - I'm going to make the beds. - And where do you plan to install them? In the gorillas' enclosure, or the polar bears'? - The—cheetah nursery. - Did you think of asking me for permission? - She asked me. The nursery's been empty since the two baby cheetahs grew up. There are only little tapirs left. Tiny little tapirs— - So you're going to turn the zoo into a hotel? - You're my new parents. I thought if my Dad agreed, my Mum would too. - I see, so when you need me I'm your mother? And then when things go wrong, I become your aunt again. - What are we standing here for? It's not heavy but I look weird. Everyone's looking at me. - If dad said yes, let's go. - Great! You're getting played. - You know I never learnt to resist women. - Hi Bernard. - Hi. Here are the mattresses. Grab it! - Thanks. - Hey, you're well set up! - Yeah, it's good. - See you later. - Bye! Sorry for earlier. I don't know why I did that. - You should never apologise in life, little man. Those who are going to adopt you are crazy. Or they don't know you. - Yeah, they do know me. And they're not doing it for the money like all the foster families I've had. - Of course, genius, they're not doing it for money. If they adopt you, they won't give them any money at all. - No money? Are you sure? - Certain! So they must really want to have you in their house. There are fools everywhere. - Will you be leaving? What will you do? - I'll try to join a circus. A horseback acrobat in training for years without a horse. That's bad. - In your father's circus? - Forget my father. For him I've always been a good-for-nothing who didn't want to listen. He hates me. But don't worry, I'll get a job. If it's like Momo and Graf you'll get nothing. - I'm not saying it'll be easy. What are you thinking in your little brain? - Some people say, after a year, everyone from here ends up in jail. - We've talked about it a hundred times. We did bad things, but we had no choice. This time we start from scratch and we forget all that. Got it? - Got it. Hey Petia? What does "impulsive" mean? - It's when you act without thinking too much. Why? - The doctor wrote that in my hospital file. - Why did you stick your nose in there? - He also wrote that I'm a danger to others. So if I'm impulsive, maybe that's true? - Stop talking bullshit. There are some who pulled themselves out of shit worse than ours. I know I'm going to get out of this. - Me too? - Of course, you banana. Come on, take your medicine and sleep. 10 p.m. - Lights out! We're a month from final adoption. A bit late to bring up such a reservation? - This child has latent depression. Did you see what happened? At the slightest annoyance, he relapses. Besides, I don't need to remind of all the suicide attempts. Remember the lighthouse? Without your intervention, he'd have jumped from the top! I don't think putting him in this girl's adoptive family is the right solution. - And why do you want him to keep on being depressed? He's finally found himself with people he loves and who are happy to welcome him. - That has nothing to do with it. I repeat, we treated the symptoms, not the cause. - You're seeing Madame Le Guellec today? - Yeah. - I'll come and see you when she gets here. - OK. When Eric's with us, will he still have to stay at school all week? - No, he'll be in La Rochelle, same as you. - Great! Still a long time to wait? - As long as the adoption procedure takes. - Great! Then will he still stay with us forever? - Of course, since we'll be his family. - Great! Can you imagine, we'll be like—siblings. Not like siblings, you'll be siblings. - Amazing! Hey, you do have other words in your vocabulary then! Gentlemen, I hope that these few years spent with us have been profitable for you. - All right, can we go? - Of course. Do you have any idea what you're going to do when you leave? Jean-Maurice? - Well, it took me 3 years to get a mechanic's diploma. That wasn't so I can cook in a pizzeria. - Answer the judge politely, please! - Okay, no need to yell. I didn't say any bad words. I answered. - And you? - Me and Momo—Jean-Maurice—we'll be mechanics - Good. And you, Petia, what are your plans? - Petia, you were asked a question! - Do I have to answer? - Simple information. - Apart from the mechanics course you were in with your two classmates, you never wanted to do any of the professional training the centre offered. - If I know what I'm going to do, why would I train for stuff I'll never do? - That's why we're asking you the question. - But I assure you, you don't have to answer. - Clown. I'm going to be a clown. - In your father's circus? - No way. - What do you want? - I want to say goodbye to Petia. - You can say goodbye later. Out! - Believe me, gentlemen, the best thing for you is start afresh and forget the past. - That won't be difficult. Hey Momo, you got a piece of paper? - No, not the garage business card. I only had one. - You know the phone number by heart. - Fuck! If you have a problem, don't hesitate to call me. So Jean-Maurice, you hid your first name from us for three years! - It's Spanish. Juan Maurice, not Jean-Maurice. - Say that then, because Jean-Maurice sounds a bit faggy. - Great! Why did the fucker have to call me that? - Petia! I'll be there if you need me too. If those two get to be mechanics, they won't be getting anywhere near my car. We found the other wreck stripped out after the weekend exeat. - Do you think they were stealing cars? - How d'you think they paid for their phones? - You should have reported it to me. I could have done something. - It's not my job, it's the police's job. And even the police give up. A few days ago the science teacher wanted to intervene— Eight days days off work. That kind of holiday I don't particularly need. - Petia is not a thief! - Eavesdropping becoming a habit? - Out! - Eric! This idiot's talking rubbish! Petia's juggling in the street. That's how he paid for his phone. - Relax. Did you have a problem yesterday? Something you didn't want to talk to the doctor about? I don't say anything to him, he's a jerk. - He's a psychologist. If you want him to help you, maybe you should talk to him a bit. - A psychologist? Have you seen his face? He's the sick one. If he's married, his wife must have run away. - Eric— He sets his clock to half an hour and he wants me to tell him my secrets? - You're not his only patient. He has to keep to his schedule. - His tennis games, yeah! I'm not a robot. I can't speak on command. - He's one sharp kid, that. - Is the centre's psychologist married? - I think he's divorced, why? - No, nothing— That's the last time I'm taking this stupid bus. - Go and see what time there's a train. - Okay guys, bye, I'll leave you here. - You're not coming with us? - You're the ones leaving, not me. - The two of us, we're going to make a ton of money. - I did that, Momo. If you're dumb enough to do it again, that's up to you. - What do you want us to do? We did everything to try to get out of it. - I haven't seen you try very much. Look, there's an opportunity. Job Centre - I can't go in with this lot. - The lockers? What are they for? - We'll get kicked out again, I tell you. - They don't know you here. Good morning. Morning, Madame, I'd like to register at the job centre to find a job. - We can't do that without an appointment, young man. - Ok, I'd like an appointment. - Which district of La Rochelle are you from? - Why are you asking me that? - Because each district has its own agency that manages the cases. - Well, I don't live in La Rochelle, so— - So you have to go to the office in your own city. - What if I don't have a city, Madame? But you live somewhere? To live somewhere, I need money. To have money, I need to work. So I would like to work to have an address, Madame. - Can you lower your voice please? There's no use getting upset. - But this bitch is annoying me with her two-cent questions! He's crazy. Here! Job Centre, my arse! Hey, what is it? Is it my fault again? - Did you hear how you spoke to that woman? - So? - Fine. Get moving! - I can tell you one thing: My brothers have never been in jail. Well, they don't have jobs either. The truth is, you're scared. - There's a regional strike. There's no trains today. Even the bus is cancelled. - We're not going to stand here like idiots? - In a couple of hours, if you want, with my faggot's juggling— I'll have collected enough money for you to take a taxi. - No need, we'll manage. - Bye, Jean-Maurice. On the other hand, we can try begging. - Do you know how to juggle, idiot? - No. - So we do what we're used to. - What about this lot? - The lockers? What are they for? But, if we're siblings, Eric and me— when we're grown up, adults— I won't be able to— - Marry him, right? - I never said that! - You were thinking it so hard it's written on your forehead. - Whatever. - All little girls fall in love with Dad, big brother, their cousin— It's normal. - Yeah ok, but this isn't the same. One day, we won't only dream. - I hate to think what I still have to teach you. Wait for me here! - Girls aren't allowed in anyway. I wouldn't like to be adopted! - People who do that have money. If you have money, you have fun. - Yeah, but they're not your real parents. - Why do you care if they have money? - You think about that too much. - And what are you thinking about? What do they do? The people adopting you? - He used to work in a lighthouse, out in the middle of the sea. - Did he own the lighthouse? - No, he was the keeper. Now he's a fisherman and lifeboatman. - He's a fisherman? He's got a boat? - Yeah. - You see, loser? it's not just anyone who has a boat. It's the ones with money. - It's just a small Zodiac. - It's still a boat! - And what does his wife do? - She's a vet in a zoo. - A vet? A dog doctor? But they're loaded! They earn so much money they don't know what to do with it! I was almost adopted too. - What are you still doing here, then? - The moment they saw his face they threw him out. - Yeah, that's right! - In the Children Service's file, there was a mistake. They ticked English instead of Arabic. - Is that why they brought you back? - That's why I'm learning English. Wow! If that's the new nurse, I'm going to camp in the infirmary! - No no! That's my new mother! - His mother's super cute! - Hey, you can still try to get treatment. She's a vet. Since you're a donkey, maybe it'll work, man! - Hey, are you calling me a donkey? I'm gona get you! Gona kick your head in! - Is your suitcase ready? - For ages. - The judge wants to talk to me. I have papers to sign. Come here, you bastard! - Hey, you smoke too much my friend, there's nothing left in your lungs! We fucked him over good, didn't we! It's hard enough on my own, a lot more difficult with two. - Is this the right way for Bordeaux? - Yes, the highway's two kilometres that way. - He's beautiful. I like horses. - Is that a guitar? Are you a musician? - No, it's a balalaika. - You're Russian? You speak good French. - I've been in France a long time. Reintegration centre for Minors in Charente Maritime Petia Vissotsky - All right, I have to go home. Every time I want to ride him, he refuses. - You're afraid. He feels it. Horses are also afraid of strangers. - Thanks. - You're welcome, Iris. Always believe what is written. And it's written there. - Goodbye. Seriously, we're the champs! Hey look, it's Petia. Stop, stop. - Arsehole didn't manage to get a lift. Hitchhiking not working out? - This guy left the engine running. Too easy! Get in! We'll drive you to Bordeaux. We won't make you pay. - Fuck off. - Too bad for you, Russkie. What the hell's that? - There's a coded circuit breaker. Start the engine and the alarm goes off. - Damn! What do we do? - Come on, get out of there! - Guys, guys, there's a car. Shit! - Oh they're smart! - Get down, Graf! - What are you doing? He's never had a crisis with us. The psychologist should accept that maybe he's better off with us, right? - I promised to do everything to make this adoption a reality, and I will. - Final adoption keeps getting delayed. Eric will believe it's our fault. - I know it's annoying, but it's just an official form. Eric can continue to come and spend weekends and holidays with you. By this summer it'll all be over, I promise. - But we don't give a damn about any official form! Let them keep it! We don't care about adopting him! - A little patience, Madame Le Guellec. With adoption, it's often the legal issues that take the most time. - Eric knows how we feel. And no legal issue will change anything. - Eric! Your girlfriend's outside. - Hey, are you ok? I thought things over. You know, when you're with a foster family— if they piss you off, you mess up so they kick you out. But now, you're going to be there for good. If they're seriously dumb, it's for life. At least you know them well. - We never know anyone, Rémi. I notice you're happy to see me. - It's nice of you to come. - Don't force yourself— - Eric, you forgot your bag. Don't tell me you've had a fight already? You realise you have to watch out for Marie like she's the plague? There's one simple reason: She is the plague. - Give up. Monsieur is sulking. - Oh really? What's the matter? Look at me at least. What happened? - It's nothing! - Yes, right—I don't believe you. So answer me. - I don't see why I should tell you. - Because now Pierre and I are taking care of you. I can tell you we won't pretend. We will do everything to be worthy of your trust. It won't be a week, or six months, like in the families you were with before. This is forever. You understand? So I ask you again: Why are you angry with us? - I heard what you said in the office. - Listening at doors is his speciality. - Yes? And—? - You said you didn't care about adopting me. - Have you any idea why I said that? Because I don't give a damn about official forms! What I want is you to come and live with us, and as soon as possible! That's all! - Sorry. - You're a pain in the arse! - What about me? Do I smell? It doesn't matter. I know boys have a very limited intelligence potential. - You've got nothing to worry about. You're a real girl. - Right, let's go. Sir, the superintendent would like to see you. The police called. - Thank you, I'm coming. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Do you mind real girls? Sloppy work! If I wanted to resell it, I'd have to rewire it. Who made the connection? - I did. I grounded it to neutralize the system. - You didn't tell me you knew electrics. - You never asked. - Well, I hope no one saw you. Because now you work for me. So first mistake, you're out! And you, you're staying there for a while. This is no time to be wandering the streets. - That's nothing to do with me. - Hey! Do you know all the risks I take because of you? - Don't touch me. - You don't piss me off, I don't piss you off! Ok? Hey you, close the gate! We're not at the Car Show! - For once that bastard met his match! - Hold on, just put yourself in his place. We show up with our fucking car— - Your fucking car! I'm out, Momo. - Where are you going? - I didn't come here to find a dormitory. - I'd be careful if I were you. - Of you? Did you add seaweed? - No, why? - No I did. - In the fish? It's disgusting! - Don't, it's full of vitamins. It's like the weather here, you moan all the time. If it's not rain, it's drizzle. And the vitamins, you'll need them because tomorrow's a busy day. A new parrot show. Boat trip. Horseback riding, and so on. - Oh great! - It tastes really bad. - You know nothing about it. You know nothing at all about it. And while we're slinging mud around, how about this:! Tell your employees to hang another sign above your door— announcing that you are the one and only vet in the zoo. Because I'm constantly being asked questions. What am I supposed to tell them? I don't know what a polar bear eats. - Don't you know what an old bear eats? - No, no. I'm already sleeping with a half-crazy tiger five metres from my bed. - He sleeps in a cage. - So what? The space between the bars and the size of the tiger, that's something to panic about. Obviously Mademoiselle sleeps with the vapers, I mean the tapirs. - Is that true? - Yes, and don't forget your bed is over there too. - Yes, that's right. - Will you show me? - Come on, come on. - Eric? Hold on. I have something to give you. I made you a keyring. I like everyone to have their own key. - This is for me? - Who else would it be for? You're at home here, aren't you? Imagine being chased by a tiger and not knowing where to go. Now you'll know. - Thank you. Come on. This is it. - Great! - Symbols are important for children like them. - For children, yes. For me, I don't know if the most important thing is— the first time we made love or the day you asked me to live with you? And the 47th time, does that count too? - Don't tell me you counted! - I am an educated bear. You know I'm a specialist in wild animals though? - Oh really? Let's go to the menagerie, come on. - You're the one carrying it all. I have nothing! Turn around. - You're not putting on your pajamas? - I don't have any. These are too small now. - So why do you keep them? - My mother bought me them. Don't make fun of me. That's nice, what is it? A powder compact? Did a girl give it to you? - Yeah. - Don't make fun of me either. Her name is Joséphine and my father gave her to me. - Sometimes I wish I could fall asleep and everything would go back to how it was. - If everything was like before we might not have met. I'm glad you're my brother. - I'm not— Don't worry, if I see him hanging around here, I'll call you. - And if he tries to get in touch with the other two, let us know immediately. - Of course. - Have a nice day Monsieur. - You too. Goodbye. Now. Tell me! Go on! Get in! What's going on here? - I don't have to answer to you Monsieur. - Touch the kid again and you'll see who you have to answer to! - Calm down. I know him. He used to be lighthouse keeper at Cordouan. Sorry Pierre, we must question your godson. - He's not my godson, he's my son! Your son, then, if you want. - It's not if I want! We had a ton of forms to fill in so we could call him that, so he is my son! - Don't get upset. We just want to ask him a couple of questions. We're looking for a young man involved in a car theft. The owner is in a coma. - What's that got to do with Eric? - It seems he knows the suspect. Since he left his family, we can't find him anywhere. And to ask him a favour you treat him as if he's guilty? - Listen, we know your kid. We just want five minutes with him ok? - What's the matter? - I'll explain later. - It's starting all over again! Don't be silly, you know very well who Petia Vissotsky is. You just spent over a year with him at the centre, so you know him. - Just because you see people every day doesn't mean you know them— - Don't play games with us. We just want to know where we can find your friend. - Why are you looking for him? - None of your business! Well? Tell us where he is? - None of your business! - If you keep fooling around, you're going to be in trouble. - I'm scared! - What about your new family? you want them to be in trouble too because of you? - If you don't tell me why you're looking for Petia, I'm saying nothing! - He stole a car. Because of him, a man's in between life and death. Is that enough for you? - So now tell us where he is? - Petia would never do that! - How can you be so sure? - Because I know him. - All right, you can go. If your friend faces some problems, you'll know that it's partly your fault. - Why did you let him go? He'd have told us eventually. - Dream on. You'll get nothing out of him. That kid's a real tough nut. Last year, with his girlfriend, they laid waste to the whole area. Don't blame the judge, Eric. Petia's an adult, so this isn't the judge's responsibility. And the police, you know— They preferred not to tell him. - Is the driver still in a coma? - Yeah. And sadly, I believe it's very serious. - It wasn't Petia, I'm sure of it! - I'd like to agree with you, but it seems two witnesses have formally identified him. - Petia would never do that. - Eric! Eric, stay here! - Wait here, I'll deal with him. Do you want to go sand yachting? - No. - Are you scared? - Nothing a girl can do has ever freaked me out. - Macho! - If Petia's innocent, he may not know he's wanted by the cops. - Are you sure it's not him? - He wouldn't have told me about the circus. I need to phone him. - We can go to Corinne's office. - I don't want to be seen calling him. - There are phoneboxes near the beach. This time of day it's deserted. That's the string for the diabolo. Roll it on the ground. Lift— Yes, look! You're doing well, Zoé! Right on to your head! Are you okay? Go ahead, start again. Petia, Petia! Cops! Good, we lost them. Fuck! I'm the one they're looking for because of your bullshit! - I didn't know about the guy, I swear! - It's fine! Go away! Forget me! - The cops came to the garage. We confused them. They won't bother us again. - Of course they won't since it's me they're looking for! - That's ok, the car was his idea, not mine. - That was me, not him. OK? - He's always doing that. Just slaps you and walks away. He's a faggot. One day I'm going to hit him, you'll see. - You're a douche, Graf! That's why we slap you. Allo? Yeah. Yes, I know where he is. Why would I tell you? No way. The cops came to see me. You probably know why. So if you want me to tell them about your shenanigans, just hang up! - Wait, I'll see if I can find him. Petia! It's Eric! How are you, little fella? - I'm fine. - Good. Are you okay with your parents? - Not bad. - I'm happy for you. - What about you, how are you? - Yeah, I haven't found a job yet but I'm juggling here and there. I earn money. - Where do you sleep? - I—found a small hotel. - Petia, the cops came to see me. They're saying you stole a car and hurt someone. - Do you think I could do anything like that? - No, I know, but—the cops seemed sure. - It wasn't me. - I know that! We shouldn't start again. The judge isn't stupid when he says that. If you want, I can ask a fisherman to lend me some money? - No. Let it go. - You feel better? Did you find out what you wanted to know? Now, how about we go sand yachting? - If you like. What did you think? You were going to tell him everything? - He believes in me. You made me lie to him. It was my father's. - How does this thing work? - Get in. - Is it dangerous? - No, I'll show you. It's like riding a bike. Are you scared? - I told you before, nothing a girl can do ever freaked me out. - Macho! You're right, it's like cycling. - Oh damn! - Hey, did you get blown off? - I'm covered in sand! - Hurry up, the parrot show starts in five minutes. I'll join you later. I'm having problems with the tiger. - Isn't Pierre coming with us? - He's already there. Doing my show, four times a day. It's tough being a star. Oh, I'm tired! And now, it's the bike! Oh dear, the bike too. Come on, I'm cycling all day, four times a day— Now the slot machine! Oh that too, it's always the same. I keep playing but I don't win a single coin! What's the point, honestly? That makes you laugh. Obviously! And now, the car! I prefer a motorbike. This car doesn't even have a roof! Here we go! When I think I'm paid nothing at all while I lead a dog's life— I should say a a parrot's life. There you go! Oh dear! That's it, now, on top of that, I have an engine failure. Oh, I think I broke the engine! There's a problem in the engine! Yes, in the engine! I look like an idiot when beautiful girls in the audience are looking at me. Hi. - Hello Pierre. Did you see? I'm impressive as a parrot. And I'm going to get SP tattooed on my chest. Super Parrot. What's the matter? - Nothing. - Yes there is, tell me. - It's not easy for us. What's going on? - You weren't at the show? - I thought I was funny playing the parrot. We weren't here. The other parents were there. - They try to show how grown-up they are. But they're still children. We're sorry. - No worries. - I have to haul my nets. There's nobody to help, they 're all at the show. Do you want to come? - Let's go? - No point in me coming. I don't know anything about it. - I'll show you. - I'll only waste your time. - I thought anything a girl could do was easy for you. - Go and put on your raincoats. I'll make you some sandwiches. - Madame, I know you're doing all you can to be nice to me, but— It's not your fault. - I know that. Don't worry. He called me Madame. Damn, it's a big one! Well, are you coming to help me, yes or no? - I thought we were going to help you haul your nets? - Well, my nets, their nets, same thing, isn't it? - But we haven't even been to sea? - Whether you go 2000 km or stay in port, the sea is still the sea. Have some crab. - But these were caught for you. - Yes, it's home delivery. You don't like crabs? Look, this one looks like he's smiling. Lets' go. Thats enough. Thanks Philippe! - But you didn't pay for them? - Hold on, I was the keeper for years. Now I'm a lifeboatman. That's how it is, or you don't eat shrimps. You like shrimps, and I like shrimps. This way we eat shrimps. - But are we allowed to do that? - That's rich coming from you! Right, you wanted to see the sea— we're going to see the sea. A gannet! - Why are they called that? - They're weird birds. They sleep by day, they fish by night. The next day, they do the opposite. - As soon as we're different from the others, people say we're crazy. - Crazy people don't exist. There are only different people. - You only say that when you feel pity. - Sometimes I wonder how you come up with such nonsense. - If they don't give you any money for me and Marie—and I don't make you feel pity— why do you care about us? - You both love the sea, don't you? - We prefer storms. - Children love storms. It's less common in adults. Except the gannets and the psychos who spend their lives in lighthouses. - But there's no one in the lighthouses now? - Do you know why I love the sea? Because it's unpredictable and wild. Like you. - Corinne will know we haven't been at sea. We're not even wet. - That can be fixed! - Come on, come here. Help me to catch her! No, no, no! - Come on, into the water! Come on, come on! In the water! In the water! - Go on! - Two of you on one girl! Nice! - What do you expect, we're cowards. Hey Marie, it looks like you! Watch out, she's coming. - Not a word. Silence! - What happened—you're soaked! What did you do? - We had a terrible storm. - A storm? Must've been right over the boat. We haven't had a single drop here! - Well there's a microclimate around here. - Really! - What microclimate? - Shut up, you! That's all right— You'll catch cold. Get to bed! What are you looking for? - My medicine. - Do you always leave your stuff in your bag? - I never unpack it. - Why? - So I don't have to repack the day I have to leave. - Good night kids. - Good night. Do you want to leave? Are they in bed? - Yes. After what you did with them, I think they'll sleep well. Look. I found this. It probably fell out of Eric's pocket. - Petia Vissotsky—he's the boy who's wanted. - I'll give it back to him. - Hold on. I'll copy the number. Give it back later. - Okay, I'm going to wash some clothes. When I told him about the theft, he wasn't surprised. It means that he knew. And since the thief was alone— - If you were sure it was Petia, would you be upset? - I'd be even more upset for him. - Why? He would have lied to you. - It's hard to lie to a friend. Pierre! Corinne! Quick! It's not me! It's not me! It's not my fault! - He keeps repeating that. I try to talk to him but he won't answer. He didn't take his medicine yesterday. - It's not my fault! - Calm down Eric, calm down. - It's not my fault! It's not my fault! - What are you talking about? What's not your fault? - Mum! I swear, it's not me! It's not me! I didn't want to run away! Mum? - He thinks you're his mother. Take him in your arms. - Yes? Go back to sleep. I don't want you to leave anymore. - It's not my fault. I didn't want to run away. But I was afraid. - But what were you afraid of? Aren't you angry with me? - No. - No, I'm not angry with you. Sleep, my love. Sleep. Everything's fine now. It's okay now, it's over. What about you? Are you all right? You're a bit pale. Do you want to sleep with us? All right, we'll see you tomorrow. Good night. - You're one hell of a girl. It's a nightmare we all have at one time or another. But at that age, it's not fair. - Except I told the judge he'd never had a crisis at home, so I'm wrong. Especially since we're in the same dead-end as him. - No. You managed to calm him down without giving him medication. Only mums can do that. Sleep. Feeling better? - Yeah, but you can still hug me if you want. - Bastard! You took advantage of me! Will you marry me when we grow up? - I don't know. - Are you afraid that when I grow up I'll become a thug? Like Petia? - You're crazy. Why do you say that? - Before, you'd never have said I don't know. We'll pick you up on Friday, okay? - You don't have to come any more. - What are you talking about? - I only stayed two days and you got nothing but trouble because of me. - But we know it's not your fault. - Kids like me shouldn't be adopted. We only attract trouble. - Why are you talking such nonsense, Eric? - One day I'll start bullshitting again. Like Petia. We don't have a choice. It's stronger than us. - You have no right to say things like that. It's hurting Marie! And don't you remember? We're together. For better or worse. Forever. We are your family. - I wish I could pretend you're my new mother. But I can't. - Well it doesn't matter. If you love us a little bit, that's fine. - all the same I love you more than just a little. - Hey, Madame, are you the dog doctor? - Yes, that's me. - One day, will you take me for a ride, Madame? - If you want. - You have to be nice to Eric. He's a bit of a nutcase, but he deserves it. - Are you his friend? I can see you look out for him. - Wait, who are you? I don't take orders from girls. - I'm his sister. - Why didn't you say that before! My friends' sisters are my sisters too. Ahsra will take care of your bro, like I was his sister. Finally, you understand me. Hey, are you coming to play with us? - No. She had trouble falling asleep, too. She's starting to worry me. Besides, I'm not here all day tomorrow. - Don't worry, I'm here. - You're here. The lighthouse keeper keeps watching. You must be starting to miss the long evenings in your lighthouse, right? - You know, regret takes time. And here, you have to be a freak to find any. Children, animals, making love twice a day— - Why do you always talk like an idiot? - It's not easy, but we both know we'll succeed. - We? - But it was me wanted to adopt Marie. At first, you were just there to help with the paperwork. You weren't supposed to stay. And then, there was Eric. And now you're fighting like crazy for all of us. - It's thanks to them we found each other. I'd have to be a total bastard not to be there when they need me. - Being there when you're needed isn't the same as living together, right? - I don't know how to make a declaration of love— —but I love you. Is that okay? Because if I have to develop it, that'll be hard. - I don't know. Don't you want a normal life? A normal wife? - What's that? A normal wife, a normal life? - You know very well I was living with someone before, right? We were going to get married, we were happy. A month later my brother died. I lost my baby. I had surgery. There were complications. I don't know if that's why he left. - Maybe that means it wasn't him. - Maybe it also means it wasn't me. - Well yes, it must be you. It's— It's fatal for the reputation of an old sea dog. But there's only ever been you in my life. I don't see why that should change. - You just said you were no good at declarations of love? - With you, I'm a fast learner. - Now—didn't you also say twice a day, yeah? - Yes, but it's past midnight, Madame. - You taught me that the crew only go to bed when the captain has turned in. - I do remember that rule, sailor. That rule's fine by me. It's one that suits me— it's a fisherman's rule. You're on Petia's phone, I'll call you back. Petia, what the hell are you doing? I keep leaving you messages. Hey, what are you doing to me here? Are you clearing out your drawers? You don't want it any more or what? Hey Eric, you coming? I got some sheets from the projection room. - Yeah, we're going to play Deathwatch. - What the hell's all this? - You put a bucket each side of the board. One full of ice, the other full of water. You balance it just above the sleeping guy's bed. Then run away. The ice melts— and all the water falls on his head! You're a maths freak, aren't you? He's a beast in physics! I can do your bucket thing, but without the ice. - How d'you do that then? - Well—like this! - Fucker! Wait till I get hold of you! - Just get back here, you bastard! - This bastard's gona kill you! Go ahead, read. - Read what? - Pretend it's a missal. - Hey, I'm a Muslim! I don't read that. Anyway, Christians read the Bible. The Jews, the Torah. We read the Koran. But what do the blacks read? - I don't know. - The Jungle Book. Hail Mary, full of Grace, Hallowed be thy name. Welcome into Paradise this leftover that no one wanted. On top of that, he stole cakes from the canteen. Of course, he died too young— but better he died too soon than for us to be left without cakes. - She's not breathing any more. - Who's he talking about? - Yes, there's mist. She's still breathing. - Eric, what the hell are you doing? - Help me, just help me! - Eric! Eric! - I don't want you to die! I don't want you to die! - What the hell's he doing? - I don't want you to die! I don't want you to die. - Have you gone mad? - Hail Mary, full of Grace, Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. - He really thinks he's a priest! Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. - Eric, what are you doing? - I didn't want you to die. I didn't run away. But she died anyway. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. - Eric, where are you going? - It's not my fault. - Hey! Are you okay? - It's not my fault, Marie. It's not my fault. - We can't hang around in the corridor, we're going to get caught! - For Petia too, it's not my fault. It's not my fault. - We know it's not your fault. - It's not my fault. - Come on, give me your hand. Give me your hand! - It's not my fault. - Come on. - What's happening? Eric? - Come on buddy, come on. - Eric! Come on! - It's not my fault. The psychologist won't be here this morning? - I think he still has outside consultations. - Eric has never had a crisis at home. I've already told you. And if it had happened, we'd have known what to do. So I won't leave without Eric! I can't make such a decision without the doctor's approval. - So what do we do? I accept responsibility. You're taking a big risk. The doctor made it clear Eric had to be placed in a specialist facility from today. When they accused him first, I had doubts. - There's a lot of evidence against him. - There's a lot of evidence against us too. And we've done nothing. - No, but the car didn't disappear by itself. - That doesn't prove it was Petia. I know he's hiding something from me. I also know he'd never hurt anyone. - I'm coming with you. - No, it's too dangerous. - So you believe what that other jerk wrote? Do you think you're a danger to others? - No, that's not true. - I have to come. I'm the only one with money for the train. - You think I need a girl for that? - This is the address of the witnesses who saw Petia. If we ask them, we might be able to find out more. - Where did you get this? - That's none of your business! Still don't need a girl? I don't understand. Why did he do that? What you wrote isn't true. I'm not a danger to others. - Why did he write that in his medical file? Is the doctor leaving his stuff lying around? Where's Eric? - He hasn't disappeared, has he? - Considering the painkillers he took, he's not likely to get far. - I can see you don't know him! Great you have such qualified staff! - Congratulations! - I saw them heading towards the station. They told me not to worry. He was with the little girl. - They may have gone straight to the zoo. Without telling us? I'm going to the station, maybe they're still there. - I'll come with you. - What should I do? Call the police? - Absolutely not! Everyone has their own job. Remember? You got it? We meet in two hours in front of the garage. - I'm not stupid. Where's the garage they work in? I only know it's near the big silos. We'll go up and take a look. - Your other friends, are you sure they'll know where Petia is? - They're not my friends. But if they know something, they'll tell me where he is. But you have to wait for me to go in. They're too dumb. Their shit definitely works, I even have itchy eyes. See the big silos? The car should be over there. - Are you all right? You're shaking like a leaf. - We didn't stop running and the medicine they gave me was for sleeping. - Do you want to sleep? - For the next hundred years... - This isn't the time to play Sleeping Beauty. - Are you sure you'll find the Post Office? - Whatever you guys know how to do, most of the time it's girls who taught them. - Just remember that in Sleeping Beauty, it's the guy who wakes the girl. - Are you sure? Ok. This is the number that tried to call him several times? Very well. - If they were on the train to La Palmyre, I'd have seen them. - I got the trace on the phone's owner. It's Petia Vissotsky. It hasn't been used for a week. Although people tried to contact him several times. - That's our number. And that's the centre number. That means it must have been Eric who called. - Now we know the originator of the calls and who he was trying to reach. - Couldn't you trace the call? Yes, I did. It's La Rochelle. La Rochelle's a big place. - I found a garage address in Eric's pocket. We can try there. - So let's go! He took a week off, he'll be back on Monday. - Thanks. Do you want me to leave him a message? - No. Are you Iris Varendal? - Yes, why? I want to talk to you about Petia. Petia Vissotsky. - You must have the wrong address, I don't know anyone by that name. - Well, that would surprise me. The cops want to put him in jail because you said you saw him stealing a car. Hey Petia! - Go away. There's nothing for you here - I spoke to a girl waiting for you in front of the garage. - What the fuck do you want me to do? - She wants to see you. It's Marie, Eric's girlfriend. Come on. I'd have liked to tell you the opposite. He looked nice. But it was him I saw in the car. - There's a problem, I'm telling you. The car was stolen in the harbour car park. And Petia was with you on the road out of town. - Do you think someone met him with the car? - Of course! And if there was someone else— —that means it wasn't Petia who did it. - If it's so easy to guess, why didn't the cops see it? - Cops— As long as they have a culprit, they don't try to understand. You're going to call this number. It's my judge. Tell him everything you told me. - If what you say is true, it'll be my fault if he gets trouble. - Fault can be fixed. That's why you need to call the judge. - I'll do it. Tell me something, why are you doing this for your friend? You said it yourself, he's a good guy. And he's not just a friend, he's my best friend. I've got to move. I need to meet her. - I have a car. If you want, I can drive you. - You ride a horse, don't you? - Yes. How do you know that? - I read it in the judge's file. Maybe you're not totally useless, after all. So you want to see Petia but you've never seen him before— So talk to me, I'm Petia. - I don't believe you. Petia is Russian and you don't look like a Russian. - You're smart. And cute too. Two or three more years, I'd like to do things with you. But a bit of a shortage of boobs, yeah? - Let me go! - Don't fight it. - Let me go! - One day you're gonna love it, come on. Come on, let me touch— - Let her go! Get off me! Let me get him! I'm gona kill him! Next time, I'll kick your head in! Ok? Get out of here! They said the scrapyard was behind the big silos. And according to the map, this bridge is the only way to get to the docks. - If they went to the garage, they must have come this way. Did Eric tell you to come? - The police came to question him. - Yes, I know that already. - They're sure it was you. Eric says that's not true. - What does he know about it? - He says—all the people he loves, bad things happen to them. - He's sick. He thinks he's dangerous. It's been going on for years. - You have no right to say that! He's trying to help you. So if you're guilty, you have to tell him the truth. Otherwise he'll still have the crises and they won't let him live with us. - What do you want me to do about it? I'm not a doctor. - Motherfucker! - Hey! - Let go of me! - I got myself in the shit. I got into it all by myself. It's not Eric's fault. It's nobody's fault. But if Eric comes here, he'll be in even more trouble. So the best you can do is tell him you couldn't find me. - I'll say what I want. Don't worry. He won't know that you're as much of an idiot as the others. Marie! I went to see the girl. Now I'm sure Petia didn't do it. What's the matter? Fuck! One day I'll make them pay! - It's not important. - And Petia, why didn't he stay? - I don't know. - You want me to believe he stood up for you and then just walked away? - I can't remember. - You're a bad liar, Marie. What did he tell you? - He didn't say anything! - He told you something. But you won't tell me. - He told you I was crazy? And he didn't give a fuck about me? - No. - Now I know it wasn't him. - Where are you going? - I need to talk to him. I've been looking for you everywhere. You can't stay here. Donnadieu already called the cops. The judge has already been at the garage. We're screwed. - I told you he's a scumbag. - What we gona do? - You're going back to the scrapyard. - You crazy? - You want to walk? - Fuck! - You should never have got into this, Momo. There they are, over there! After the cheetah nursery, are you starting on the docks now? - Why did you follow us? - First of all, I'm not the one leaving business cards lying around. And second, I don't need your pemission for what I do. I'm getting tired of your bullshit. You gona run away every time some new problem comes up? - We would have come back. - When? And what about Corinne? She's worried sick right now, I can tell you. - It's not her fault. I wanted to see Petia. - Would've been nice if you'd told us. We could have gone together. - Would you have come with us? - Yes I would have come with you! And stop talking to me as if I'm a moron, Marie! It's easy to say that no one understands you. That works both ways! Come on! Get in the car! - We're sorry. - You can shove your apologies! I want you to swear to me that you won't ever go off without telling us! - Petia says he can never apologize either. - So that's another reason to see the guy! I hate being imitated! Sure it's this one? - They're up there! - Come on, let's get out of here. - What the hell are you doing in my office? - Be careful, he's with the other guy. - These are my car keys, right? Were you planning to steal my car, you little cunt? Where's your pal? Where's your pal? Don't move! - Don't shoot, don't be stupid. We can come to an arrangement. - There's no arrangement! - I have money. There's money up there in the safe. In my office. Here! Take the keys. Take the car, take it! - I don't give a shit about your car! - No! No! - I don't give a shit! Fuck you! - Stop! Stop! Don't be stupid, I'm your friend! - Look me in the eyes. Where are we going now? Where are we going? - Stop it, you're crazy! Petia, are you mad? No! - Come here! Now get in there! Damn, Donnadieu! The bastard reported us to the cops. - That has nothing to do with it. That's not why we're here. - You can't fool me! What about him? Maybe he's a cop? - Petia, don't be stupid. Put the gun down. I'm here to help you. - To help me? Me? I spent years in your shitty centre, you never helped me there. - Stop! - You're here. You disappoint me, man. Are you cosying up to a cop now? - He's not a cop. He's my adoptive father. He's all right. - Petia, put the gun down. If this goes too far, no one can do anything for you. - We're going to become top criminals. I know your game. - Stop, Petia, damn it! You're acting stupid here! - I warned you Momo. Shouldn't play dumb! - Monsieur, he didn't take the car, it was us. - Shut up, they'll never believe you. - We do believe you! We went to see the girl with the horse. Now we're certain it wasn't you! I told him that you used to look out for me. - Damn! - Your opinion will never matter to them. - It matters to me! - You trying to fuck with me? - Don't act stupid Petia! At the centre, you said we'd be fine. But if you don't believe in it, how do you expect it to work? - It's too late! - If you're innocent, it's never too late. - Who's going to jail if the guy dies? I've never seen that guy! And if not for the other bastard, Momo and Graf never would have stolen the car. Nothing would have happened! And that fucker will start training other idiots, like us! And you know why? Because nobody wants us! If we don't get our shit together, we starve! And you're not going to tell me no one knows. Everyone plays this game! - No, not everyone. - You need first aid. We can't leave you like this. - I don't need anyone. You getting in? - You've gone too far. I'm staying here. - I warned you. Shouldn't have started. - I'm sorry for all this shit. - You should never apologize. - Swear to me you won't use the gun. - I'm no murderer. Help me. Gently. We're going to take him to hospital. - No, not a hospital, they'll call the cops. - We know someone who can help him. - Look after him, I'll see to his mate. Don't worry, the police will be here soon. - You're not arresting me? - Me? I'm a judge for juveniles. Don't you remember? It wasn't me, man. I swear to you. - I know that. I always knew. Corinne, please, the tiger's getting more and more excited. I don't know what to do. - I know, but I'll have to see him tomorrow. They're not home and I can't think of anything else. Excuse me. Turn over. Mind your arm. Corinne, come quickly! - Where have you been? Where were you? I've been worried to death! - Petia is injured. - What d'you mean Petia is injured? Who's Petia? When are you two going to stop this nonsense? Why do you always go off without telling anyone? - It wasn't her. I told her to go! - That's not the point! - He's hurt, come on! Come on! You have to take care of him. - But I'm not a doctor! We can't take him to hospital, he's wanted by the police. - Have you all gone completely mad? Have you any idea of the risk we're taking? - What did you want me to do? - But he didnt do anything! - I'd better go. I don't want you in trouble because of me. - You're not going anywhere, ok? Stay here and don't move. Kids! Out of the way! I'll have a look at it. Give me the scissors, Pierre. - Here. - Thanks. I see you! - Is it serious? - He'll be OK. I was worried about his eye, but he'll be fine. Time for bed, ok? Marie. Sorry for earlier. I got angry. I shouldn't. - You should never apologize. - What did he say? - He said you should never apologize, Mum. I couldn't sleep. I wanted to see if he needed anything. - I wasn't asking anything. Was that your mum's compact? It's nice. You wanted to see if he was breathing? I just wanted to see if he was in pain. - I wasn't sleeping. You've already done that to me. You're afraid the people you love will die. - It's horrible seeing someone dead. After that, he never moves again. - That's true. But I tell myself that if I'd seen my father's body, I'd know for sure. I still believe I'll see him again one day. - When you've never seen someone dead— it's better to believe that. - You saw her? - She used to wake me up every morning to take me to school. Not that day. I was in her bedroom. She was lying on the floor. Her eyes were wide open. I ran away. I went to the pharmacy, so they'd call a doctor. When I came back, the police were there. And the doctor was giving her artificial respiration. He took out a mirror to check. He said she was dead. If I hadn't run away, I could have given her artificial respiration. And she'd still be here. - You had so many crises at the centre. You talked to me so much that I went and read your medical file. Your mother died of a heart attack, Eric. Neither you nor anyone else could have saved her. - It's my fault. I ran away. I wasn't there. I'm a coward. - You went looking for help. You thought of her before you thought of you. Cowards don't behave like that. Men do. Now, go to bed. You've done enough for today. - Come on. I want to give you this. I'd rather you have it. I found his medicine in the bin. We might get there eventually. When he wants more, he hits the fence. Go ahead, lift me up. Looks like you're better! - I'd find it hard to complain. - We took him around the zoo. - What about your head? Ok? - Yeah. He's magnificent. He's a trained tiger, I can see that. - How do you know? He wanted me to be a tamer. - Your head's spinning, right? Take him to bed. I don't think the tamer's completely healed yet. - He's not lying. When he was young he lived in a circus. Now he wants to be an acrobat. He showed me a lot of unbelievable tricks. Will you teach me? You don't want him doing you a show from his bed, do you? Out you go! Bed! I don't know why they came snooping. But for now better stop the walks in the zoo. - But why should he hide? Momo and Graf confessed to stealing the car. - The judge said the police believe they're afraid of Petia. That they're protecting him by denouncing themselves. - It'll never end. I'm tired of always having to hide. - We're not really hiding you, the judge knows you're here. I've missed three months of training. I won't be able to go to the circus festival this year. - What were you going to do? - Acrobatics. When I was a kid, I was already part of the show with my brother. - You never told me you had a brother. - He works at the Krone Circus. I'd have liked to work in a big circus too. - What do you need to keep up your training? A horse? - Before the horse, I have to become a good acrobat again. - We could ask the beach club to lend us some equipment. - Surely you'd be better off with us than hanging out in the street, right? - All in favour? Anyone against? You better be good now. You have to stay. Wow! I told you he's good! The wound's opened. -Go and ask Corinne to redo the bandage. She didn't yell at you? - No. She just told me I'd have another scar. For my collection. - How did you get that one? - That was a claw. - A claw of what? - A tiger! - I don't believe you. - Yes, my father wanted me to be a tamer. Like all the men in the family. - And you didn't want to? - I wanted to be a clown or an acrobat. But he said clowns were for the broken-down, the good-for-nothing. And then Masha was born. - Masha? - A baby tigress. A little ball of hair that big. I could do anything with her. One day she got into the cage. She was so small, she could still get through the bars. She didn't know the others were dangerous. She wanted to play. - The others caught her? - I got the fire extinguisher to save her. My father often hosed his big cats to calm them down when they got excited. A tiger caught me with a claw and I had to run away. My father thought I was the one who put Masha in the cage. - Is that why you ran away from home? Come on! You're going to teach us how to trampoline. Yeah! Your turn, Pierre! - My turn? - Yes, go ahead, try it. - That's not in my line. - Go ahead, go on. - One, two three— - No! stop! Help, help! - on your toes. - Tell Corinne to come and watch us. - I tried to call her but no answer. She looks like a frog with rheumatism. - Anything a boy can do is too easy for a girl. We called the police. - What's happening? Corinne got stuck in the cage. Shit! Don't panic, we'll do like the other day. - Except this time, he doesn't seem to want to move. - Don't move! - He's smart. He understands that we'll only open the door when he's well away from it. Trained tigers don't make the same mistake twice. - Do you know what you're doing? - Yeah. Close the door. - Go and get my rifle. We absolutely need to sedate him. - I'll make this work, don't move. He wants to try to dominate, to show he's the strongest. You mustn't show him you're afraid. Don't move! Get behind me. It's ok. - Isn't he on file with us? - I'd be surprised, he's my assistant. - Whatever, but I can tell you we have his picture at the station. - Come on. - Get out of there! - You were right, little brother. It never stops. Tigers are like humans. They obey when they're afraid. - Everyone's afraid. There's no shame in that. - I'm not afraid. - He mustn't turn his back on him. - What no one knows is that animals only think of one thing. The moment they can catch you. - I can't shoot him, he's always in the way. - Is there a fire extinguisher here? - Yes, over there. - That's what people come to see in the show. - Petia, we know you're innocent. We'll help you to prove it. - Free! I want to be free! Eric! Eric! It's all right, he's not going to run away! - I owe you a big debt. You knew how to stay calm. - Next time you won't need me. - Don't worry, we'll get you out of this. - It's better lthis way. I was tired of hiding. - Let's go. - Petia! - You see? You're not a danger to others. - Come on. Now that Petia's an adult, the judge can't do anything. As the police went out of their way to remind him. - That doesn't make sense! - They know it wasn't him who stole the car. Eric spoke to the girl who was testifying against him. Someone else brought the car back. - You're playing policemen now? So I suppose it was Eric who took the file from the judge's briefcase? - No that was me. - A pretty pair! Come on, I'm not blaming you. Maybe this will move things along. Either way, I'm proud of you. When someone's innocent, we have to do all we can to help him. Petia, you can thank the judge. He took risks for you. - If the man hadn't come out of the coma, I wonder what would have happened. - That's why we shouldn't fight only to arrest the culprits. We should also fight to free the innocent. Don't share this, but I'm glad to have known you. - Me too. - Petia! - There's someone here to see you. It's nice of you to come. - I know you got into a lot of trouble because of me. - He knows her? - I'm sorry I didn't see there were several people in the car. - How could you have seen them? The others were hiding. - To begin with I read it wrong. Then later, I saw it wrong. - In my opinion, he knows her, yes. - I was told you like horses. I work in a riding club. You can come and ride if you want. - She even has a car! - Shut up. Why don't you go riding? She 's made you the offer. - There's no point. Too long since I've done that. As for acrobatics, I need someone who can correct me. You only learn that in a circus. - So why not go to your father's circus? - Corinne and Pierre are nice, you're lucky. My father is not like that. He really is too stupid. - You say we're lucky. Although I really love Corinne and Pierre, they're still my second family. They're not my real parents. Yours are still there. - Whatever difference that makes— - You have no right to say that! If mine was still alive, I'd tell him everything. I'm sure he'd understand. - She doesn't like people saying bad things about her parents. - Marie! Marie, come back! - Give me a break! - You're right, I'm going to practise. - Do what you want, I don't give a fuck! Leave me alone! - Come on, you're going to catch a cold. I'm sorry. I'll go and see my father. - I thought you always said you should never apologize. - Well you see—I talk bullshit. - Just because he's acting big doesn't mean he doesn't need us. - It's not important to be big and strong. I need you. And you need me. That's our secret. You do know our horses here don't do tricks? - That doesn't matter. - See that one? No one ever rides him. He scares everybody. Dainty Horses Along the cliff over the abyss Right at the very edge I whip my horses. —with the whip, I drive— Something in the air is not enough for me I drink the wind, I swallow the fog, - I feel with disastrous delight— I'm disappearing, I'm disappearing A little slower, my horses! a little slower! He's bonkers! Too tight— Is he always like this? —you do not listen— - Yeah. —to the whip. But sometimes the dainty horses— came across to me - And I didn’t have time to live, I didn’t have time to finish singing. I will water the horses Come on! I'll finish the verse I'll stand for a moment— On the edge—on the edge— Are you OK? - Could you lend me a saddle? - Yeah. - You were right, he's bonkers. We are a family. We are inseparable.
