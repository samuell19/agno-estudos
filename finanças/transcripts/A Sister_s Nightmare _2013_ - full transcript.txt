No! Get off of me! No! Get off of me! No! No! Get off of me! No! Please!! Cassidy? Cassidy? Cassidy? I'm waiting for your answer. Would other members of your family be at risk if I were to allow you to leave this hospital? Is something funny? Yes, Dr. Gershman. Would you care to share it with me? No. I see you've been drawing on your arm again. Do the black squares represent something? Just a game. What sort of a game? What sort of a game, Cassidy? Hey hey hey. It's okay. Mama's here. Mama's here. Come on. It's okay. Mama's here. It's okay. I couldn't breathe. I know, I know, it's okay. Here. That roaring in my ears. Let's get this off of you, okay? Do you want your bucket? No. Alright here we go sweetie. Under your tongue, under your tongue, okay. I couldn't. I know sweetheart. Let it dissolve. Okay? I couldn't get up to the surface. I know sweetie. It was just a nightmare. It was so real. I know. The whistling. Everything. I know. But it wasn't real, was it? Hi Phil. Sorry I woke you up again. It's okay. Sleep's overrated. Okay. You gonna be alright? Promise? You sure? Yeah. You're not gonna wake me up again? I love you. I love you too. Get some sleep, okay? And I'm right upstairs. Okay. I love you. I'd have given up on me years ago. Good thing your Mom's not you. What? Your Mom's no quitter, Em. Face it. We're not going to Jamaica or Mexico or anywhere together after grad unless you beat this thing. You think I could be going crazy and not know it? You're not going crazy, Emily. Okay, maybe a little bit. Tina! Lighten up, will ya? According to my Mom, tons of girls our age have anxiety attacks. She sees them all the time in Emerg. They think they're having heart attacks. Stabs right here? I've had those. Really? Like when? Remember when Bigsley laid that surprise test on us? Then. Just please, don't quit your lessons. Or, say goodbye to Mr. Hottie. Cassidy. Dr. Schwartzien said these should hold you off until they could make you an outpatient. Is someone coming to pick you up? No. I hope things work out for you, Cassidy. Morning. Hey. Just the way you like it. Thank you. Behavioral therapy. Aren't you already an authority on that? Well I was hoping this site would give us some different ideas. Things we haven't tried before. But all the same stuff. Maybe you and Em need a break. I mean, you said it yourself, the poor kid goes from one therapy to another and you research every one of them. Em's a teenager now and this might be something she needs to figure out herself. Thanks, Phil. Thank you Phil. You better get dressed. It's a big day. Can I have your attention please. Now don't forget you guys need a warrant before you go outfitting your perp's car with a GPS tracker. Anyone have any questions? Captain. Yes, Rydert. How many did Ridgewood get? 18 surveillance cameras and 12 GPS trackers. Are these strictly for narcotics captain? Everyone meet Vic Monroe, Rydert's new partner. Morning.Welcome. And the equipment is for anyone who needs it and clears it with me. I'll be in my office. Alright, that's all folks. Smoke? Oh, no thank you. I haven't touched one of those since my daughter was about that size. Cop with no vices, huh? Gum. I chew gum. Sometimes I like to crack it. Ooh, you're a dangerous girl. Ah well. How long you been in Ridgewood? Um, 12 years. I moved here so I could afford to buy a house. Couldn't see raising my little girl in a one-bedroom apartment in Portland. That's where you're from, Portland? Yeah, Forest Grove. Used to be a small town, and then Portland gobbled it all up. Why'd you leave Seattle? I had my fill of big cities. I grew up in a small town, like this in the Midwest. Friend of mine invited me out to visit him here. Ridgewood felt like home. Never been married? Nope. No? No, I never saw a reason. No kids. Alright. Sergeant Rydert! Look, I got a new bike! Hey, great! Keep your hand on the bike, Brooks. You know everybody around here? No, just most of them. Keep them moving, everybody. Keep them moving. That's it. Here, let me help you. Lean back, that's it. Good. Light slip and let your legs slide up. Okay, keep moving. That's good, good. Now try it on your own. Thought you'd given up. I would if my Mom would let me. Well, we just started. Come on, you better follow me now, or he's going to have my hyde for leaving the group. Thanks for waiting. I could have called to say it was going over time if Mom would let me have a cell phone. No problem. So let me get this straight. You sat beside while you let some fat lady lay on Josh's hand? I didn't let her, Tina. I can't float. Not if you don't get in the water. It's not like I don't try. I do. Did I say a word? Anything? You're good. Did your Mom get an Avon lady? See ya. Bye. Excuse me! Are you lost or something? No, I'm looking for Jane Rydert's house? That's her house right there. I'm Emily. Her daughter. You're much prettier than Jane. Thanks, I guess. I'm Cassidy. Emily. Oh, I said that already, didn't I? Come on in! Mom? Someone's here to see you. Okay, be right there! Cass. Hello Janie. What are you doing here? I was discharged this morning. I've been in the hospital. Oh. Well, you're just full of surprises. I had no idea you were getting out. I need a place to stay for a few days, just until I get set up. Wow, it's so private here. Could do anything you want and no one would ever know. Everybody watches everything you do at the hospital. Am I welcome, Janie? Of course. Um. We have a pullout couch in the storage room, I'll show you. Come on. Aren't you going to introduce me to your family? Um. Of course. I... This is Phil Martin, my fianc√©. And well, you've met Emily. This is Cassidy, my older sister. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Phil. You said your older sister died in a car crash. Okay, um. You can put your things in here and I'll go get you some towels and linens. Sorry. Um, I'll just put these here. You can make your bed when you're ready. So what are your plans? Plans? Yes. Plans. Like, now that you're out. I don't know. Maybe I'll stay here for a little while and become better acquainted with Phil and Emily. Um. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to work, Cass. Hmm. That's too bad. I'll let you know when dinner's ready. I thought your sister lived in a long-term psychiatric facility. She does. I don't know what she's doing here. Why are your whispering out here? Um, we're just trying to figure out if we have enough dinner for everyone. I really appreciate not being treated like a child. I'm sorry, love. It's complicated. Uncomplicate it for me then. Why did you tell me your sister was dead? Is it because she was in a hospital? Look, this is not the time or the place to talk about this, okay? Whatever. I'll be in my room. Really? You guys haven't even talked in years? Well, we didn't come from the generation of online chatters and Cass's hospital was in Oregon. Long distance used to be very expensive. Isn't that right, Phil? Well, I mean before all the competition. Long distance wasn't cheap. No, my father always thought of the phone as a tool for emergencies or necessary information. Definitely not device for chitchat. They're being polite Emily. It's okay. It's all water under the bridge, now. Mmm. This meatloaf is delicious. You make this yourself, sis? Um, no. Phil does most of the cooking around here. I would love a man like you. Um, I am back in school this year and I get home earlier than Jane. I agree with Aunt Cassidy. This meatloaf is awesome, Phil. You can just call me Cassidy, hun. Aunt anything makes me feel ancient. Which one of us you think looks older? I think you're both beautiful. Well, a toast to Janie for raising such a smart girl. Hear hear. So Phil, why don't you tell Cassidy about what you're doing in school? I'm getting my law degree. Used to be a court officer. Got tired of spending my days with criminals and crazy people. Well, as a lawyer I'll be able to pick and choose who I spend my time with and I am very much looking forward to that. Well, who's ready for some of my chocolate cake? I know I am.Yes. It's really good. Mmmm. So what was that all about? You agitated her. By talking about my career? It doesn't take much. I know she's your sister and bipolar and everything but is she okay to be here? What did the doctor say in the phone conversation? They left the office by the time I called so, shh, she's coming. Hey Cass. Don't worry about that, you must be exhausted. Oh. Oh, you have a chess board. You play Emily? Sometimes. With my Mom. I'll play a game with you Cassidy. Emily has homework to do, Cass. No. I finished it at lunch. Our father taught Janie and I how to play chess. He always said... Chess sharpens the mind? I don't remember my Grandpa but my Mom says the same thing. What colour do you like? I usually play white with my Mom. I like black. Jane? Jane? You kinda spaced out there a little bit. I'm sorry Phil. What are you doing in here? Just getting a glass of water. I left a bottle in your room. Oh, I didn't see it. Is there anything else I can get you? No. Sweet dreams, Janie. There's been a homicide! Yes, I'm the one that found them. Rydert. Officer Jane Rydert. No, I think she's still breathing. Yes, I'll wait here. Jane? Hey. Any particular reason why you slept down here last night? Yes. Cass was in the kitchen last night. So? Maybe she was hungry. Shhh. Keep your voice down. She's not here. She left at the crack of dawn. Said she had some things to take care of. Any reason why you put the armchair over here? Yes. So I could see the room. Are you alright Jane? Yes, I'm fine Phil. Something just doesn't jive. I've had regular phone calls with her psychiatrist for years and never once did Dr. Gershman indicate discharging her was a possibility. I remember specifically discussing her mood swings and memory lapses on our last call. She's had a fair bit of shock treatment and memory loss is common. Well, that's a big improvement. Amnesia. No, most of their memories return. Except for the days and weeks leading up to their first treatment which often stays lost. Cass doesn't have a clue what happened the entire two weeks before hers. I gotta get moving, I have an appointment at Cass' hospital. Then who would have authorized my sister's discharge? I did. At the recommendation of our hospital's psychiatric review board. Well Dr. Schwarztien, my sister hasn't been well enough to leave this hospital for 15 years. Dr. Gershman must have informed you. Dr. Gershman's retirement wasn't anticipated. He had a stroke. Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Yes, it was almost completely debilitating. Just a moment. Um. Ah here we go. "Now, it is the unanimous opinion of this review board "that Cassidy Laurel Rydert presents no further threat "to herself, her family or the general public. "It's recommended that she be reintegrated into society" "at the earliest available opportunity." This was six and a half weeks ago. No disrespect Dr. Schwarztien. Have you read my sister's file? Sergeant, I'll admit I am still playing catch up. Dr. Gershman, he was with this hospital for over 33 years and his caseload was massive. But you can rest assured, I have reviewed every single one his files. Now, it's true, Cassidy has had her difficulties. But she is responding well to this new medication. Provided she continues with it, I am confident her issues can be maintained as an outpatient. So, that's it. You know, this re-entry period, it can be challenging for families. Here we go. Your sister is ready to re-enter society. I hope you're right, Doctor. You crack me up, Em. Bonus, Mr. Hottie's here! Oh, no! What do I say? How about, "Take me! I'm yours!" Shut up! He'll hear you! Hear what? W'sup Emily? Hi! I thought you graduated? Last June. One of my old teachers invited me in to give his art class a kick in the butt. Inspirational speech, wake up, sky's the limit, paint the moon. So. Emily. What's it going to take to get you in that pool? You know, you're making me look bad. It's bad for my rep when one of my students won't trust me to get her toes wet. My boss has been asking. I've been telling her that for weeks. I'll try harder. Next lesson. Yeah? Yeah. Next lesson. He's so into you! Really? You think he likes me? Oh no, he wants to hook up with me but he can't unglue his eyeballs from you. Hi. Emily. Tina, this is my Mom's sister I was telling you about. Cassidy. Hey.Hello. Are you coming from somewhere? No, just out for a walk. You? This is the way we always walk home. My school's back there. Well, we gotta go. Enjoy your walk, Cassidy. She does seem kinda weird. I know, right? Just gotta make a quick stop, Vic. Girls like a ride home? Seriously? In that? Mom? What's wrong? Nothing! Yes or no? You're working, aren't you? Hop in if you're coming. Hey, Em. I almost forgot. Awesome! Sweet! Thanks! What happened to 'unnecessary teenage excess'? Well, you're a 15 year old girl walking home after dark. You need a phone. Well don't get too excited. It's just for emergencies, okay? Put your number in. Yeah. Bye! Thanks for the ride! Love you! Love you too! Drive your kid home often? In the vehicle? No. Rarely if ever. Oh. I didn't see you come in. No, well you were reading, I didn't want to disturb you. You looking for something? No. I um, I just took a wrong turn. You're down there. Oh. I didn't see you there. I came to see your room. Yeah. It's cozy. That's for my behavioral therapy. To desensitize me. I've been afraid of water as long as I can remember. I don't know why. I have a fear of drowning. Does it work? Yeah, sorta. I guess. Don't you like to swim? Uh uh. Not at all? I can't swim. I used to be scared of these pictures. Why were you in the hospital? I had a breakdown. Was it hard to get through it? I bought you something. My nirvana. I don't 'really have a CD player either? I just use this and it doesn't play CD's. What's happening here? Why are you home so early? Uh... quiet night. Mom, look! Cassidy got me a present. Have you ever heard of My nirvana? Where'd you get the money for this? Doctor Schwarztien helped me re-access my bank accounts. They do that when they discharge patients. Well, um I'll keep it in my car. Our CD player in there still works. Why did you have to take it from me? Well you can't play this on your tablet. Emily. I cut my sister out of my life for a good reason. What good reason? Cassidy is mentally unstable. Like me. No! Not like you. Why would you say such a thing? You're aqua-phobic. You'll overcome that. She has much more serious issues. What are her issues? She's horribly impulsive and she hurts the people she's supposed to love. Is that why you told me she died in the car accident with my Dad? Yeah. What are you writing about? School stuff. Doodles. Why are there hearts all over this paper? Because that's all I know how to draw. You may just learn to swim after all! Just making myself something to eat. Can I get you anything? I'm taking her with me Janie. Don't be ridiculous. Something wrong? No. Where's Emily's photo? Your sister was in here earlier. But I doubt she would scoop up Em's photo without asking. What was Cassidy doing in here? She got lost, apparently. Try to relax. I can't. Try to get some sleep. You ready for coffee? I have honey oats and wheat squares cereal. Oh, um, a few of these look really decent. Okay. I'll pour your cereal. You and I both know that Emily is better off here. You're not equipped to take that on. Teenagers are a lot of work. If you want, I'll actually come and look at some of those apartments with you later. Um. Do you have to do this now? I'm studying for my midterms. Oh I'm done. Em suddenly decided to lock her door? Well you know teenagers. They like to have their privacy respected. Did you get any sleep? I have to run. I'll see you tonight. Cass. What are you doing here? Decided to take you up on your offer. To look at apartments together? I'm at work. We can talk about that tonight. Go home. Didn't mean to embarrass you. Nice to have met you. Sorry, Vic. My sister is staying with me and she gets a bit over enthusiastic. Seems enthusiastic. Walked right in, started asking me and everybody where does Jane Rydert sit and Captain asked me to take her outside. I'm sorry. I hope she didn't talk your ear off. No, no just chatty. She seems uh, attractive. She single? Trust me, you don't want to go there. No? No. What's wrong? Where's Emily? What is that? It's a baby monitor. I know what it is. Why is it here? So I can hear if Emily has a nightmare before she panics. It was collecting dust up in the attic. You actually think that we're going to sleep with this here every night? Well, millions of parents do, Phil. Yeah. For their babies. Listen. Enough already, Jane. I want the truth, Jane. What am I looking at here? Cass isn't bipolar, Phil. She has what's called a borderline personality. Her sense of herself is distorted and unstable. Her emotions turn on a dime. She overreacts sometimes to happiness or sadness or frustration. You're telling me your sister did all this? Oh my god. Who is this guy? Her husband, Brian. He was at the academy with me and he was a good cop. A good husband. He was bathing their three month old baby. And she just snapped? She said she was tired of being a mother. A wife. The doctor at the trial, said that she was in postpartum psychosis. She looks dead. Yeah, she's lucky she missed her heart. Please tell me she didn't shoot her baby. Emily is Cassidy's daughter, Phil. Brian let go of her when Cassidy shot him and she slipped into the water. She would have drowned if I wasn't there. I don't even know where to start. My Mom was afraid of Cass. I could see it in her eyes when she was around her. So it made me afraid. My father couldn't see it. Cass is spunkier than Jane, he'd tell Mom. You know I'm gonna find you Janie. Cassidy's mood swung from over-ecstatic joy to angry outbursts when she didn't get what she wanted. And what she wanted was anything that was mine. My mother gave me a doll for my birthday. Cass didn't understand why she didn't get one. It's my doll! No! Give me it! Serves you right for not giving her to me in the first place. If I tattled on her she promised to tell the kids at school that I wet my bed. Or burn down our farmhouse with me and my Mom inside. So at 18 I escaped to the police academy. But she found me. Hey Jane. Jane Rydert. Hey! Brian! Hi! I want to introduce you to my new wife. We just had a baby! Surprise! Cass! What are the chances huh? Girl of my dreams turns out to be your sister? I mean, right? I missed you, Janie. Missed you. Cass was softer and not so erratic and mean. She had just had Emily. Motherhood seems to agree with you. Oh I love being a new Mommy. And wife. Yes you do. You need to try it, Janie. Yeah. I decided to forgive my sister, so we started hanging out together. I'd go for dinner with them once a week, and I'd babysit Emily if they wanted a night out. I learned that Cass' nicer personality was due to medication, but it didn't last. Brian said it was like somebody had flipped a switch and the girl he married was gone. Cass' doctor told him Cass was suffering from postpartum depression and prescribed anti-depressants. But I recognized my sister. Cass, I think you've had enough. Just get over it. Brian. Why don't you take Emily for a bath? Yeah. Hey come and see daddy. There she is. Go easy, huh? Come on. God, I hate it when he gets like this. Like what? All dewy-eyed with concern and responsibility, like he's husband or father of the year. Brian's mad that I stopped breastfeeding. I want my body back. Maybe they'll both go down the drain. Oh what, Jane? Don't give me that look. They have strangled the life out of me. Do you understand that? You're drunk. You know you shouldn't be drinking with the medication that you're taking. Just go to hell, Jane. I've been too ashamed to tell anyone. She almost drowned. And that's why she has nightmares. She was 3 years old when she told me about the first one. And I was afraid to tell her because I thought she'd think she inherited what Cass has. Oh, come here. Cassidy wants her back, Phil. What if she gets tired of her again? Look, look Jane! Oh, you're still awake! I can't sleep. Did you see the lock on the door? Oh, yeah. Phil said you wanted me to use it but I forgot. Yeah, there's been several break-ins in the neighbourhood. Nothing to be alarmed about just makes us one step safer in case someone tries to get in the house. We're putting a lock on ours too. Oh and that key is for the outside lock and you can put it on your house-key on that okay? I'll lock it once you go. Oh and one more thing. Check in with me more during the day, alright? You don't have to wait for me to call you. I will pay the bill. Okay. Goodnight, sweetie.Night. Shhh. I heard you from my room. You were having a nightmare. How did you get in my room? I locked my door. I know. I tried that first. I didn't mean to scare you. I scare easily. I'm sorry I couldn't play your CD. It wasn't the right gift. Why does my Mom say you've hurt people? She blames me for things that weren't my fault. How did you know what it was? Your breakdown? What did it feel like? What do you see in your nightmares? It's always the same one. I'm in a lake or pond, I don't know which. But I'm under water, I can't breathe. There's this horrible roaring sound. Somebody's whistling. I can see the surface and I know I should go up there but I can't. I think my head's too heavy. I wake up before I drown. I can make your nightmares go away. You can? But you have to trust me. Get some sleep, okay? Oh! It's a beautiful day; you should get out and get some fresh air! Hello? Good morning! Well, it's hard to believe we have to put steel bars on our windows in this neighbourhood. Jane, can you help me with this please? I don't even know why I have to wear one of these things. Why are you doing this? Because Cass won't leave Emily alone. She snuck in her window last night. Jane, you're really starting to worry me. Have you tried to talk to her about this? How much is all this costing? I don't care. It's keeping Emily safe. Damn. I'm late for my appointment at the university. Okay. Go. Alright I'll see you tonight. That's it! I know you can do this, Emily. You're doing great, Emily. Come on, Emily. You can do it. Emily. Emily look at me. You can do this. Just take one more step Emily. Please. One step. Emily! Emily! Emily, put your feet down! Emily!!! I got ya, I got ya. You're alright. You're alright. You okay? Sorry I'm such a nutcase. You shouldn't say stuff like that. It reinforces a negative image of yourself. You weren't ready and I pushed you. He wouldn't let me help you any sooner. It's okay. I understand. I'll run my own classes next year. Do you take a lot of those sedatives? Only when I have to. Thanks for walking me home, Josh. Really. Thanks for letting me. I really hope you come back. I have a cell phone now. You should call and remind me. Cool. So what happened? I held hands with him! Get out! Oh, my God! Don't leave out any details! Tell me everything. Uh. Hang on, Tina. Hi! Do you need something? Will you go for a walk with me? Now? Tina, I'll call you later. I thought you didn't smoke. You know, I'm a pretty good listener. Would be better than doing that. It's a stressful situation. She stays, I worry about Emily. If she finds her own place, I worry about the rest of Ridgewood. She's not that bad. I mean, she's a little odd. But pleasant enough. Maybe those doctors know more than you think. I mean 15 years is a lot of therapy. Yeah. Well you and I both know the stats, Vic. 75 percent of mentally disordered prison transfers are rearrested within 5 years. Yeah. Thanks for the coffee. How am I doing? You're walking on water. It's not terrible if I don't look. Why didn't you want me to tell Phil we were going? I didn't want him to stop us. Yeah. My Mom's been acting so weird since you came. This bridge is beautiful. I've always been afraid of it. People have driven off this bridge in the past. They don't see the reversible lane meter change. Suddenly all this traffic's coming straight at them. A boy from my high school rode his bike off here. They said he did it because he was failing school and didn't want his parents finding out. Emily. You ever think about suicide? No. Maybe once in awhile. Tina's mom says lots of teenagers think about it. She says we don't have the life experience to tell us things can get better. Have you ever thought about it? In the hospital. I think it would be like going to sleep. All your problems would just float away. I'm with you, I think it's overkill. I mean, you need a ladder to get up here already. Why is she doing this? I asked Tina's Mom and she said she's too young for menopause. It's freaking me out. Hi. Um, I got you something, as a thank you for letting me stay here. Hope you like it as much as chocolate cake. Yeah, that's very kind Cassidy. Got myself this purse down at the second-hand store downtown. It's nice. Would you mind giving this to Janie? I had it framed for her. Think she can put it on her nightstand. It's us, on our farm. I'll give it to her. Were you on the bridge today? It's a simple question. Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated then? And what's with those steel bars on the windows? For security. It's like you're turning into one of those crazy preppers. And how did you know I was on the bridge? Because I drove by and I saw you. Cassidy invited me out for a walk. She's helping me get used to water. I walked across the bridge, Mom. That's wonderful! Emily, I know you like Cassidy. It's just. She's not capable of giving you the relationship you're hoping for and I don't want to see you get hurt by her. Okay? Wait Daddy! Wait! Wait! Go home, Janie. Daddy, stop! I'm telling on you! No you're not! You pulled the head off my doll on purpose! Did not! Dad won't believe you! Dad! Cassidy made Mom fall so she could see you shoot him! No! You okay to drive? I'm fine. I just need another cup of coffee. Oh gosh. Woah woah woah. Watch out! Watch out!!! Stop the car! You can kill yourself on your own time but you are not taking me with you. Cassidy likes my Mom but Mom doesn't trust her because she was mean when they were kids and now Mom can't get over it. I thought my little brother held a grudge. Like they can be over it in whatever, 5 or 10 years. Speak of the devil. Hi! Where are you going? I've got a plan for us! But I gotta be quick or its gonna close. She's actually nice. Strange, but in a nice way. You coming in? Ok. Sir. You reporting? Yes sir. Is that a fact? Rydert. In my office. Something's obviously bothering you, Jane. I'd let it go, but it's affecting your judgement now. You've been ducking out early, not handing in reports, distracted on duty. The other day a woman called in a report. She saw you picking up your daughter and her girlfriend in your vehicle. Oh, well I can explain that. We were... Listen. Gossiping's a national pastime and this department is a prime target. You know that. Ridgewood is a small town. Whatever it is, go fix it. Dr. Kim McMaster? The department psychotherapist. Look, Captain, I don't need a shrink. My sister's staying... Like I said, I'm not the one to talk to. That's an order, Sergeant. Can I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for a place to go camping with my daughter. Maybe something with a lake. Private. Storm Lake's quiet this time of year. Nobody's up there yet. Picnic tables and fire pits are all out though. Is it far? Well you want to go off the No. 5 about 40 miles. Get off at the south entrance. The north end isn't safe. Undercurrents. Undercurrents? Yes ma'am. They're unpredictable. The north end of the lake isn't safe for swimming this time of the year. You'll be fine everywhere else though. That sounds perfect. You've reached Emily Rydert. Please leave a message or call me back. Emily, it's Mom. Thank you for your message. Thanks for checking in. It was late getting out of there. How'd it go? Doctor thinks I'm projecting my fear of losing Emily on Cass. How were your exams today? Good, I think. Was Cass at the house when you left? No. She had a driver's exam to get her license restored. Oh, which reminds me. I meant to give you this last night. She said she had it made for you. Sweet, huh? She gave me a chocolate bar. She's trying to drive a wedge between us, Phil. Jane, it's a photo. To say thank you for letting her stay. She needs you and Emily on her side for whatever she's planning. What do you feel like eating? Sushi? Italian? Greek? You don't believe what I told you. I do believe you. What if she's getting better? Postpartum depression isn't permanent. What about when I was a kid? Listen. Em's getting older. She's about to go away to college. You can't protect her forever. What are you saying? I'm saying you've raised her, nothing's going to change that. Even if she has to live with her biological mother for a while. Yeah but Cassidy doesn't Emily. It's a game and if she wins, Emily's disposable. You want me to make you a sandwich? I've never seen you pay attention to those. Oh, yeah. Oh I am so hungry. Thank you. Wasn't necessary but thank you for the photo of the two of us. And you can keep the school photo of Emily. I'll just have another one made for me. I have something for you. It's not exactly an olive branch, but uh... It's not real gold. Sorry about that. See you tonight, okay? Rydert! In here. Hi. Your gun and your badge, Sergeant. You're on medical leave, effective immediately. Medical leave? Why? I went to see Kim McMaster just like you said. You used a GPS tracker to keep tabs on a civilian without a warrant. You used audio-visual surveillance equipment to spy on that same civilian in your house. We're lucky your sister doesn't want to lodge an official complaint. Now that is the only reason I'm not suspending you. Apart from the fact GPS tracking a private citizen violates the 4th amendment. And intercepting audio communication is a 3rd degree felony. You were not authorized by me to use any of these surveillance devices. I was going to bring them back. Jane. I like you. I know you're having personal problems. But you have no use to me in your present condition. Take the leave. Keys to the vehicle. Monroe, get in here. I can take myself home. Where you going? Cassidy's coming to get me. We're going camping. And you weren't going to tell me? I knew you wouldn't let me go. Well I'm definitely not letting you go, now. Give it back. It's not yours. No, you listen to me, Emily. Cassidy is not who you think she is. She cannot manage for an entire weekend. I don't believe you. She's rented a car, picked out our campsite, bought food and everything. I am forbidding you to go. You can't. I'm 15 and I have a right to go camping with my aunt. I like being with Cassidy. She treats me like an adult. You ready? You are not taking that child out into the woods unsupervised. It looks to me like I am, Jane. No, you're not!! Emily listen to me. No, I'm going. Emily!!!!!!! Emily please. Open the door. No, I'm going. Stop! Emily! Oh come on. Come on. Oh, hey. Just came by to make sure you got home. It's not a very good time right now, Vic. Understood. Uh. On second thought. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yeah sure. That'd be great, thanks. Phil's working on his midterm today and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at the master bedroom faucet. It's been dripping. Yeah sure, I'll look at it. Great, thank you. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah. Down the hall? Yeah, just to the left. Thank you! Jane! Jane!! Is it nice where we're going? Wow, the freeways are a lot busier now. Come on, come on! Come on. Jane. Jane where hell are you going. She took Emily, Vic. You too my 9mm. Self protection. You turn around and you bring back that cruiser or I am calling it in, Jane. Vic, do what you have to do, okay. I'm going to get Emily. My car is not fast enough. Jane. Jane! Jane!! I need a backup to 3076 Dollar. Come with me. I need your help. Come on. See that bag in the back seat? Look inside it. There's water where we're going? We're going in the water together... slowly. Want your nightmares to go away? Alright. This is where we get out. Why don't you have a travel bag? Emily. You need to trust me. This will all be over soon. Shh. Mom? Mom? What's going on? Why is your gun out? Mom. Mom! She's trying to kill you! She said she wouldn't hurt me! Emily. Look around! Why do you think she brought you to such an isolated place? I brought you here so we could go in the water together. Emily, I would never hurt you. Emily, I'm your mother. No. I'm your mother. I'm the one that raised you from the time you were a baby and put band aids on your scraped knees. She couldn't take care of you. That's why they took you away from her. Don't listen to her Emily! She was jealous because your father loved me! Not her! Tell her what happened that night, Jane. Tell her what happened! Mom! What happened? Mom!! What happened!! Well, I think I will take Emily for her bath and give you girls a chance to catch up. And uh, cheer up, okay? Your sister's here. And slow down with the wine. You shouldn't be drinking on those pills. There we are. Say bye to mommy. I love you, baby. Oh. This is so hard. I've barely slept since she was born. I don't know how to be a good wife and mother every day. You know what, spare me the self-pity. You have a husband that adores you, and a baby. What do I have? I wish I could share them with you. And make you happy, Janie. I don't want your charity. Don't you understand? How can you complain to me? You always got everything. I'm feeling dizzy. Go to hell, Cass. I think Brian's right, I drank too much of this wine. Will you be okay out here alone if I just go lay down for a little bit? Just go. Go to hell, Cass! Emily she's mixing it all up. I'm the one who saved your life. Tell her the truth, Jane. Tell our daughter the truth! Janie? No! For god's sake! You're sisters! Mom! No!!!!!! Stop! Stop!! No! You took away the one thing that mattered to me after Mom died. Janie. Blackie slipped. It was an accident! He broke his leg and we couldn't fix it! Why can't you believe that? You didn't have to kill Brian. Brian was supposed to love me. I wouldn't have had to do this if you had just stayed out of my life like you were supposed to. This time I'm not going to miss your heart. Rydert! Drop the weapon! Easy. Put it down now! It's over. I wouldn't have had to do this if you had just stayed out of my life like you were supposed to. "This time I'm not going to miss your heart." Cassidy's doctors contacted the Portland police after her memory came back. They tracked you down here. I was brought in from the West Division to help your sister get a confession. The name's Harcroft, Jane. Detective Harcroft. No. No. Jane. No. You have people here who love you. People who can help you. I love you, Mom. Hey. We're gonna get through this, okay? Come here. Come here. Can Janie try riding Blackie, Daddy? She's not too young. Woah. I thought I told you to stay inside the house, Janie. Go on, Janie. You hear me talking, girl? Look, your sister's too small, okay? She can't be alone out here with nobody watching her, alright? Come on. You think you're so perfect, Cass? Watch what I'm doing to your baby. I love my little sister, too. It's okay. Shhh. I love you, Janie. Smile!
