You go away! I thought I would ask you for your opinion. I didn't want my actions to cause you any trouble. Hey, how many years have you been a yakuza? Huh? We were prepared for war from the beginning. That's why we decided to resolve the matter regarding Shinyo Bank. I understand. I'll take care of it tomorrow, then. Directed by: Shintaro Katsu It's the police! We're the police! Don’t move! THE BIG BOSS THE BIG BOSS THE BIG BOSS THE BIG BOSS To overcome this issue, we need a grand sense of responsibility and courage. The people believe that there is a link between the yakuza and the police. It's true that we have used them as resources in the past. However, even if it is for the purpose of getting information, we must cut our ties with the yakuza. There cannot be a relationship between the yakuza and the police, no matter what. He didn't come again this moming? Um, he said he was going on an investigation this morning... You need to keep him on a tight leash. You can't tell which side he's on. Okay? Is it right to put a towel over your face? Yeah. I haven't slept since last night. That's tough. What's your job? Welcome. Hello, that's right. What? Hold on a moment. What? Jung? You said Jung? What? Young? The young Young? Yes, yes. I see. I got it, yes. I'll be right there! There was an incident with the yakuza. One shot another with a gun. We should hurry. They may get away. They're obviously gone by now. That's why we should hurry. It's a fight between the yakuza. Um, they’ll show up even if we're asleep. Put this on me. Was it a week before? Wasn't it a week later? Then, you're pregnant. Why do I have to deal with this? Hey! Is the old man here? I'm in here. (Men's room) What, you actually ate something? Thanks a lot. So, what brings you here today? There was a killing at a barber shop earlier. Really? Have any of the young ones been here? Three were here earlier. They were from the the Irie group. (Women's Room) That Yamazaki, he's up to no good. I talked because I trusted him. We need to hurt those guys once. - Indeed. - Hey. You're discussing something awfully interesting. What do you want? What do you think you're doing, showing us that? The murder at the barber shop, it wasn't any of you? Murder? What are you talking about? Never mind these two, Brother. Hey, are you planning to take us in? If you are, do you have what you need to take us in? - Yeah, I do. Show us, then. I'll show you. If I show you, you're coming with me. Stop bluffing. We haven't killed anyone. If you're not involved, prove it! I can arrest you anytime I want, got it? Murder, huh? Wait 30 minutes. Go ahead! The shooter is from the Oyodo group. The guy that was killed was one of ours. Why would we kill our own guy? Isn't that enough? Is this blonde hair? What is this? The s-s-shepherd. It l-l-l-icks it. "Zerohan". One point five, "senpatsu”. How should I know? I know you. 100,000, right? See you. Mr. Tachibana, can we leave those guys out and about? It's all about give and take with those guys. Reserved for Oyodo I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Sugiura from Oyodo Enterprise. We're here about the murder at the barber shop. Can you give me something? Alright, you can take him. Hey. This is Sawamoto. They're going to take care of you. Say hello. This is the weapon. It's almost too easy. You don't need to handcuff him. It's the law! You can put them on right before we bring him in. Can I see Oyabun? No, may I see the president? He's with a client now. Is this about the Shinyo bank? The Shinyo bank? That's right. The Irie group is growing Didn't they try to snatch the money you were getting from the bank? Don't compare us to that worthless Irie group. We're operating with the permission from the govemment. We're nothing alike! Thank you for coming. I'll be back again. Hey, give my best to the president. Hey! Don't think you can ignore us just because we aren't Oyodo! We take what we take just like they do! Shut up. No need to say such things. He already knows. Everybody values their life. This is something your accountant wrote. You're up to no good, huh? Look at it Look at it. Do you know what he's doing now? He's my "kaakaa". A week... Huh? Give me a week, please. A week? You idiot! You idiot! Think we can wait? - Two days. - Huh? Two days... Two days? Two days, right? - Hey, he says two days. - We can do two days. We'll wait. We don't care if you go to Oyodo or the police. What the hell, you fools? It's a call from the president of Yamato Realty. Yes. It's me. When? I see. I got it. You have me on your side. Oyodo group is on your side! Irie went to collect payment from Yamato Realty. Well, I'm guessing we need to put an end to it soon. You guess? You idiot. What do you think? Brother? The fact that some yakuza group was blackmailing Honmachi Shinyo Bank for fraud had been confirmed and was under investgation already, but after this incident, we believe that it's the Oyodo group. That’s because the victims at the barber shop and the incidents today are all from the Irie group. They found out about the blackmail and decided to join in on the profit. For the Oyodo group, the amount is inconsequential, but they can't let the lrie Group just take over what's theirs. And if they get caught, they risk the chance of getting caught as well. So, they've decided to get rid of the problem. The reason why Oyodo was so cooperative and gave us Sawamoto is probably because they didn't want us investigating any further. When we asked Sawamoto why he did it, all he said was that he was hit with a baseball bat when he was younger, and he's been waiting to get revenge. He didn't spill any other information. He doesn't say anything about being ordered to do so or about Shinyo Bank. This is what we have for now. I would like to discuss whether we should conclude that the Oyodo group is tied to the blackmail incident. Let's see. Excuse me for stating my opinion first, but I am in charge of organized crime, and I believe we should definitely go after the Oyodo group. How about it? What's wrong? No show of hands? Naruse, we don’t have any complaints filed. That means the Shinyo Bank doesn't want to file charges? They're afraid of what would happen and their fraudulent scheme would also become public. If you give up for such reasons we can't get anything done. Tachibana, what do you think? I would recommend against it. What? State your reason. Complaints are useless against the yakuza. And the Oyodo group is backed up by some big shot politician. Ex-minister something. So what do we do? When we stick out heads into their business, we'll be forced to stop the investigation. Are you afraid of a little political power? No, I'm not afraid at all. Right? Isn't it you that's afraid? l don't understand what you're getting at, but what you're saying is if we have to stop in the middle of the investigation, it's better not to start at all. Is that right? It suck to watch the guys you put in jail walk right out. Then, I ask you. If I tell you I would take full responsibility, would you do it? You've stated what you want I won't let you say no. I'll do it. But I have one condition. State it. Don't make me stop the investigation before it's over. Wada. What do you think about that? We're just like that machine. We're constantly digging. We can dig, but we're the machine. If they turn us off, we're motionless. Mr. Tachibana. Huh? I... Uh, nevermind. Then, the whole country becomes full of dirt. I don't know, but we need to be machines that don't stop, even when turned off. This one’s good. Huh? This? That's too... What are you saying? I'll get it for you. - How much is it? - It's 14 000 yen. What? 10,000 yen. Yes, yes. Hello? Hello? Yes? Hello? Hey! We're coming there now. Wait there! Go! Hey, you... Papa, it's Mami. Take me somewhere fun tomorrow. Oh, yes... I'm sorry, Mami insisted on calling you. Ah! I need to go. I'm sorry, I'll talk later. Hey. Where’s the money? Hey! Who are you? Who are we? We're from the Oyodo group. Ah, hello? Isn't this a bit much? I already paid 6,000,000 yen the other day. I already gave you 5,000,000 yen this month. And having the young ones coming in and out of here is a nuisance. What? What are you talking about? What? A young one from our group? No, that's not possible! He... Hello? I've taken the phone. I'm Tachibana. Why don't we discuss this face to face? Our target is the Oyodo group. It's not about your fraudulent schemes, alright? What are you talking about? I've never... Here. I already paid 6,000,000 yen the other day. I already gave you 5,000,000 yen this month. And having the young ones coming in and out of here is a nuisance. Well, my wife and my child don't know anything about this. I won’t cause any trouble for your family. We can't take down the yakuza without your cooperation, you see. I'm begging you. The back door, huh? Tachibana. Did you find something that stinks? Don't treat me like a dog. I did it on my own. It has nothing to do with the Oyodo group. All 35,000,000 yen?! You took it all yourself?! What did you use it for? Huh? Horse and bicycle races. Mahjong. And there's so many people in need these days, I've donated it all. How much did you give to those people in need?! Hey! When I do something bad, I remember it well. But when do something good I forget about it. You bastard! Is it some kind of study group for the police today? Then, I'll teach you something. What's your name? It's Wada! Mr. Wada, huh? I bet you can't even do what our youngest members can do. What did you say?! Say it again! Wada, don't get mad. You lose if you get mad. You know well. You must have scored enough points with this already. Isn’t that enough? Sugiura. Nowadays, police can't get promoted by scoring points. There's a testing system now where you have to properly study, take and pass the tests. Then, why don't you study? We don't have the time to study because we're chasing you guys around! It won't be two or three days. Hey. You might as well get comfortable because you'll be here for a while. Even if you don't talk, we have others that will. You don't know if there's an organization within the police, but we do. You don't know if there's an organization within the police, but we do. Is this alright? He's not allowed any visitors for a while. I see. Say, are you really a detective? Yes! What a fine man. Hey, it's here. Thank you. Excuse me. Have some. Okay. There's nothing to investigate here. It must be great to be a detective. You get to investigate anything. I guess. Were you sleeping? Yes. Who were you sleeping with? On my own. The bed's too messed up for that. Is there something in there? No, nothing. Are you telling the truth? See, I'm not lying. You’re lying. Your heart is beating faster. What's this? What are you doing?! Just because l've been nice, don't treat me like an idiot! - You're rich. - Who cares how much I have! It's none of your business! This has nothing to do with him! I earned this money, with my body. My own body! Get out! I'll give you anything you want. Really? Anything but this. Your woman is something. Right? You could never have a woman like that in your lifetime. Of course not. I’m not like you. In any case, the world of yakuza is a tricky one. When the young one is in jail, is Oyabun allowed to have fun with his woman? Huh? Doesn't this belong to your Oyabun? It was on Mayumi's nightstand. Sugiura. There's no reason to take all the blame yourself. Yeah, that pipe definitely belongs to my Oyabun. Right. But I'm not going to trust a story like that when I can't leave this place. I'll show you another interesting thing. Look. She even gave me something. Don't think your police badge can protect you. What would you do if I didn't have a badge? I'll make it so that you can never talk again. You bastard, you bastard! Bastard! You bastard! So, he's deﬁnitely coming to the second show? Yes. You know what to do, even if I don't spell it out for you. Yes. - Equipment? - I have it. I'm counting on you. Hey. Leave now. In the rain, no umbrella. I cried in the rain. Poor love, Komari. I don't even understand the words. I have no friends. Poor love, Komari. One day, mom called to me. I'm going to die soon. As I pleaded, "please forgive me," I was crying, "please don't die." Poor love, Komari. - Hey. - What? What are you doing? Following us around? Think about the other customers. Get ready! Where is my father? No one tells me. In the rain, no umbrella. Searching in the rain. Poor fove, Komari. Poor love, Komari. Please, excuse me. I'm in here! Hey, you, go away! To the bathroom, please. What are you doing? You fools! Go after him! Doctor, doctor, doctor! Call a doctor! Call the best doctor in Japan! - Hurry up! - Yes! Bullets are part of the way of the yakuza! Where the hell were they when the bullets came?! What's the point of having them around, huh?! Idiots! Bunch of fools! Have their fingers cut off! Damn it! Brother... Please... I don't know exactly why, but maybe Ogata worked behind the scenes to shut it down. Otherwise, we wouldn't be told to stop the investigation. There's no way Ogata would that. Sugiura was supposed to take full blame for that incident. But there's no other reason. When there are so many shootings, the chief probably can't get promoted. Chief, please clearly explain the reason why the investigation is being shut down. It's probably better for you if I didn't. - What do you mean? - Let's see! If you thought hard enough you would know. I'm asking you because I don't know! Alright, then I'll tell you. First, your threatening ways in dealing with the victim, forcing him to file a complaint! Next, your method of investigation! In other words, your intimate relationship with the yakuza from the past may cost the reputation of this whole department. That’s what the director decided. But that was all on your orders! That's your responsibility. You must be kidding I never ordered such things. We're all putting our lives at risk for this job. Our lives on the line! You used us so you could get a promotion! You're in charge of fighting the yakuza?! Don't make me laugh! Tachibana, is that how you talk to your superior? - What? - What? That's it! I quit the force! I'll get dirty, like those machines out there. I'll get dirt on myself if I have to. If you didn't have people like me the country would be full of dirt. That's what I believed in! I quit! I can't work for a man like you! You bastards! I quit! When you think about it, these two departments are like a parent and its offspring. I'm going fo work hard, like I've never done before. I ask for your cooperation. In regards to the successor, he was a detective, so you all probably know him already. He was the Assistant Chief, Yonekura. Yonekura will be taking over. I know him well too, so l'm very happy that he will be leading us. Yonekura, please come here. I spoke to the director. He said he would leave it up to me. The Chief stepped down, so... If you see him, give him this. I'm no ordinary man, you know. Hm?. Woof! What is it? I'm looking for Mr. Tachibana. Has he been here? Tachibana? I don't know. Did something happen? I was with him just this morning. What? I was with him this morning. This morning what? He hasn't been here. Thanks! What were you doing? Hurry up and sit down. I always bang my head there. Whose turn is it? - Yours, old man. - Mine? Whenever l hit my head, I get a good hand. - See, it's alright. Okay. Richi! Old man, how much do you have? - 18,000 yen. - 18,000, huh? Hey, old man, that's pathetic. I'm sorry. So, how much do you really have? I really only have 18,000 yen. I don't trust you. Let me see. You have 28,000 yen. What? Really? Anyone who stayed up for two nights would have sight problems. The only thing that still works is my dick... Hurry up. What? Rush me and I'll arrest you red-handed. What are you talking about? Whatever. Richi! I'm sorry. Hey, old man, your turn. Huh? Darn! And I was at richi. This is no good. Look, Ron! Dora. It's bonus tile. How about that? - Old man, you owe 65,000. - 65,000. - How much for me? - 25. This is a lot. Alright. Hey, 10 for me. It's 100,000. You had 100,000 yen. Right? Stop pretending. Let me see your memo pad. See, it's written here. 100,000. Today? What are you talking about today? Come on, get it out. Stop pretending. Alright. Hey, I heard you quit the force. Did you really? So what if I did? That thing in the past, I wanted you to take care of it. Hm? That thing, you know. If you quit the force, you can't look after me. How much? Forty. Here. There's no use looking at my face. Are you drinking? I'll take it seriously. Hey, I'll do it! Hey, I heard you quit the force. If you quit the force, you can’t look after me. Who is this? - Someone from Oyodo. - The name? You're not worth giving my name to. I have one of yours. Hey! Come get him! Otherwise I'll turn him into a cement block and drown him. Hey. Are you listening?! Fine, you wait. I'll do the same to you! Who the hell are you guys? Thanks for the phone call earlier. You took one of ours. So, I came to get you. Let me at least put my underwear Hello? Oyodo group. I'm from the Irie group. I sank one of yours in the river. Go pay him a visit. - Welcome home. - Welcome home. It's become a big problem. Thanks for the trouble. We're reached the point of no return now. We have all of our men gathered and ready, so let us know Somebody help! Midday Attack - Welcome! - Welcome! Operation Destruction Organized Crime - Where are you going? - Please, please wait. Let us pass. Please wait. Wait! Make way! Please wait. - Where are you going? Danger of being in a Critical Situation You have to think about the times we live in. Times have changed. Right? That Irie is so minor, he's not worth your time. Dealing with such a worthless being will only ruin your reputation. Why don't you form an alliance with them? I'll make it work for you. Hey! Of course, I'll leave it to you. - Tobacco. - Yes, sir. Hey! How many of your men are you going to kill? How many are you going to sacrifice? I hate to tell you, but I hold the key. Just like the Seiyukai. I don’t have any magic buttons to push, but you won’t last long. Huh? I'll leave it up to you. You gained some respect, right? Yes. By going against Oyodo, right? If you listen to me, you can live a long life. l've been given the important responsibility of master of ceremonies by Master Hoshino, so I will do my best to perform the ceremony on his behalf. I am from Matsushima, from Osaka. I'am the second to succeed the Daizuru Clan. Family name is Ohnugi, given name is Zuichi. Please keep an open mind and I ask for your cooperation. I will lead the ceremonies to the best of my abilities. Today, it is critical that we work together for the sake of the development of our nation. On behalf of the master, I shall perform the ceremony. There are no disagreements. Please, untie your jackets. I'll warn you just in case. Once you've drank from that cup, should you ever break the promise made today, everyone who's present here will become your enemy. I hope you fully understand. Please, take it. Damn you! You punk! I'm well aware that you've struck a deal, but you've caused a great deal of commotion, so can I at least hear your side of the story? Please? Irie started the fight and, anyway, you're the victim in this case. Sorry to trouble you. Hey, Wada. Yes? It won't be good to make a scene at the police station. You know, there are reporters everywhere. I'll take him myself, so you go back on your own. - Alright? - Yes. Shall we go? Reserved for Oyodo. Thank our consideration. What's the matter? This is all becoming absurd. Even if we arrest you guys, you end up coming out right away. I feel bad for you, but we do have such arrangements. That's right. But in any case, doesn't everyone have their own appropriate places to live? Aren't you better off being a lone wolf? What do you mean by that? There are appropriate places for wolves to live.
