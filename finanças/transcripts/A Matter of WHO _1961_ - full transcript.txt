He said it was their wedding anniversary, married for two whole weeks. What a corny remark. - Will he be able to walk off? - I doubt it. - Get me the company frequency, Jeff. Hello, B Line london from Mike Bravo. We have a collapsed passenger on board. Please contact port health for ambulance to meet aircraft. - Roger, Mike Bravo. - [Mike] Ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes we shall be landing at London airport. Please remain in your seats, as no one will be allowed to disembark until a doctor has examined our indisposed passenger. I'm sorry about this health regulation. - An ambulance will meet the plane, Mrs. Cooper. Be easier that way. - Please, a Mr. Edward Kennedy is meeting us. He's arriving from the States. Could he be told about my husband? - I think that can be arranged. - Thank you. - Mr. Edward Kennedy, please go at once to the BEA inquiry desk. - Two and six please. Thank you. - The name is Kennedy. - This way. Sister Bryan, this is Mr. Kennedy. - Oh yes, Mr. Kennedy. I'm sorry but the passenger you're meeting is ill. He'll be brought here as soon as the plane has landed. - Sick? What's wrong with him? - I can't say. - You mean you don't know or you won't tell me? - Well. - A matter of policy, my dear sir. Air crew are discouraged from making medical diagnoses. For example, only last week we were alerted that a fallen passenger, a plumpish woman, was suffering from a severe cramp and to have a stomach pump at the ready. An hour after the plane landed, she gave birth to twins. Most embarrassing, but there you are. - I'm no doctor, but I don't think he's having twins. - Touche, Mr. Kennedy. It appears that your friend has collapsed. - Collapsed? - Well, drunk. - Are we talking about the same guy? - Stephen Cooper, an American. - That doesn't make sense. Cooper's been my partner for 12 years. He's strictly a milk drinker. - Well there's our airplane, we'll soon get a doctor's opinion, maybe he can make sense. - What are you selling? - Oh, nothing, I'm a detective. But not for Scotland Yard. My criminals are far more dangerous than human beings. Deadly little killers. White for cholera, red for smallpox, black for plague. The pins mark the scene of the crime. Would it surprise you to know that if world health regulations were relaxed for even a month, we'd be ridden by plagues that would put the Middle Ages to shame? Of course you would. Germs are much smarter than people. They never bother with passports or borders. They know it's one world even if we don't. - Bully for them. - Everyone through port health, Captain. - Please print on the white card your full name and the address you are proceeding to. Passengers in transit will notice their special instructions. When you've completed the card, will you bring it to the counter, please? If you have any sign of illness within the next 21 days, will you call a doctor immediately and give him that yellow card? - Thank you. - Thank you. - You can have my address anytime, beautiful. - Buzz off, chump. - Your partner has been drinking, Mr. Kennedy. In fact, he's passed right out. He's also running a curiously high temperature. We're going to keep him here a while. - Here? - We have an excellent hospital in the airport, with operating theaters. Just now we need your assistance. Mrs. Cooper can't help us with her husband's medical history. She says she's only known him for five weeks. - Yeah, I never met her. - Very attractive. - Hello, Michele. It's kind of a tough way to meet. - It could be a happier time. - Sit down, Mr. Kennedy, I won't keep you a moment. - Thank you. - Mrs. Cooper, did your husband complain of a headache this morning? - Not this morning, but on the plane very bad, here. - Before you boarded the plane at Nice, had he already started to drink? - Some, yes. - Mr. Kennedy, when did you last see Mr. Cooper? - Dallas, Texas about four months ago. - Was he in good health? - The best. - According to his passport, he's been in the Middle East. What exactly was he doing there? - Drilling a wild cat. - Wild cat? - Oh, that's what we call the first test well when you're exploring for oil. This one came up dry. - Oh. - Has Mr. Cooper ever lived in the tropics? - What are you driving at? - Malaria. Has he ever had it? - Not that I know of. - Any serious illness? - Nothing worse than a bad cold. - Thank you, Mr. Kennedy. - Any chance of seeing him, doc? - He shouldn't be disturbed for a while. - Doctor, how long will he be here? - Until we find out what's wrong with him. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to the patient. - Well Mrs. Cooper, let's not worry prematurely. I'll get you a receptionist. She'll see you through customs and immigration. - Thank you. If those flowers are for me, I'd very much like to have them. - Just a thought. They were for you, Michele, but right now they don't fit. - Thank you, they're beautiful. - The iron bachelor getting married was some surprise. Must have been love at first sight. - You don't believe in it? - Well, now that I've seen you, I certainly do. - Sweet. - Oh, I won't be able to take you into town, Michele. Steve and I had a business appointment. - Will I see you later for dinner? - It's a date. - Mrs. Cooper, would you come with me please? - At the slightest development, Mrs. Cooper, I'll call you. Bannister's the name, Archibald Bannister. - You're very kind, Mr. Bannister. - It's a pleasure. Well, I must be off. - Bannister, you still haven't told me who you are. - Department of Health, International Control. I'm with WHO. - Whom. - Not whom, WHO. World Health Organization. You see, I am a detective of sorts, a germ detective. Thank you very much. - Hey, feels like it's loaded with lead. - Oh, it is. - It's a weapon of a private eye. - In my case, a public eye. Goodbye, Mr. Kennedy. - Goodbye, Bannister. - Be careful driving back to town, won't you? - I like you to worry about me, Sheila. I like enormously. (upbeat music) - Sherlock Holmes thinks he's stolen moss. (upbeat music) - Wait, please. How are you, Basil? - Oh, as worried as you'd be if you had Arabs in Texas. - Oh, it's always the nags of you English. Strike oil in Scotland. - That would lead to more trouble than we have now. When did you arrive? - Couple of hours ago. - Where's Cooper? - In the hospital. They took him off the plane a pretty sick boy. - I'm very sorry to hear that. Well now we've got him in hospital, might I suggest we have his head examined? While drilling was going on, it puzzled us why Cooper was always flying back to the Riviera, so we made some inquiries. We got wind he was chasing a woman. - That was no wind, Foster, that was a tornado. - So I've heard, she's not exactly unknown on the Riviera. - Take it easy, Foster, they got married. - Oh, well my mistake. Well let's get down to business, shall we? It's bad luck for you, Kennedy. The British Independent is pulling out of the deal. Our borders decided to drop the south Wahbar option. - What do they expect to hit the jackpot on the first nickel? There's 10,000 square miles to be explored. - Our experts have made a thorough study. They can't find a smell of oil. - Why don't they hear what Cooper has to say? He should be out of the hospital in the morning. - I don't think he could change our minds. It's the last coring. The last thousand feet that convinced us. We're not prepared to invest another penny down there. But that needn't stop you chaps from going ahead. - Don't worry, nothing's gonna stop us chaps. (upbeat music) - Hello, Jimmy. - Oh, hello, sir. Mr. Hatfield wanted to see you, sir. Somewhat urgently, sir. It's something in the evening papers. (dramatic music) - You wanted to see me, sir? - Have you seen this? - How gratifying. The department's mentioned. - That, Bannister, is a matter of opinion. The lab report showed that your rat was harmless. An ordinary, common old garden English variety. - How splendid. - How could you, Bannister? On the merest suspicion close down the airport. Disrupting schedules, causing enormous inconvenience to everyone concerned, including myself. I spent my entire lunch time trying to pacify the airline authorities. In fact, Bannister, I promised them your head if you ever display such irresponsibility again. - My action was justifiable. The rat was found under a freight plane that had just arrived from Hong Kong. There was every likelihood that it was a carrier of disease. Really. - Oh, shut up, Bannister. In the future, when you think you've spotted an infected Oriental rat that might fraternize with our London rats make sure it is one and not just Mickey Mouse. I mean, having promised them a plague in London, see that you give it to them. To your expendable head, Bannister. The department's most valuable asset. - Where's Mrs. Cooper's room? The Coopers are adjoining. I believe those were the instructions. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. (knocks) Anybody home? - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. May I finish hanging up madam's clothes? - Well go right ahead now. You don't happen to know where madam went? - Yes sir, to Mr. Ivonovitch's suit on the top floor. - Nick Ivonovitch? - That's right, sir. He keeps his home with us when he's in London. Lovely penthouse, but it's a bit barren now because all of his pictures are on loan. Oh. (jazzy music) - You found me. - I thought we had a date. - Oh, I'll tell you exactly what happened, I forgot. - Oh, no harm done. Any news about Steve? - Well, I spoke to Bannister. They may know something definite in the next few hours. - Good. - Oh, Miss Forman, meet Mr. Kennedy. - How do you do? - How do you do? - I do very well, thank you. Well, you two must have loads to talk about so I'll just toddle along. Bye now. - What's that? - One of Ivonovitch's ex-girlfriends. - Ex, who'd let that one get away? - He would. He trades them in every year, just like his automobiles. - What did he trade her in for? - There. - A sporty job with an automatic transmission. - Would you like to meet her? - No, I'd rather meet Ivonovitch. I'll make good with the used car business. Shall we dance? - Michele, he's here, come and see. - This is Mr. Kennedy, Beryl. - Hello, you can keep a secret, can't you? Come on. We smuggled him in. That's why we came on Nick's yacht. It's so difficult to smuggle anything at London airport. Bambi, I wouldn't leave him all alone in France, would I? They said if Bambi came to England, he'd have to stay in horrid quarantine for six whole months. But Nicky knew exactly what to do. He's so clever about everything. - Except for a way to close your pretty mouth. - Nicky, it's only people we know. - You talk too much, my darling. With the authorities here, you do not fool around. The English, they come more for dogs than for people. Join the party, Michele, while I get acquainted with Mr. Kennedy. Such a fuss over an animal. Where I lived as a boy, the house was full of cockroaches this big. Poverty has an odor, Mr. Kennedy, that we never forget. Maybe that is why I like perfume. How's Cooper, what's wrong with him? - They don't know yet. - Michele is a lucky girl being married to such a man. First time we met I knew he had the kind of brain and imagination that I respect. - Will you back that respect with money, Mr. Ivonovitch? - Huh? - You're interested in oil, aren't you? - Slightly. My tankers carry 20% of the world's supply. - I mean production, the Middle East. How would you like to invest in a whole country of potential oil land? Our first test well was a duster, but we learned a lot and Cooper is confidant the stuff is there. - I give fast answers, my friend, no. - When you hit the desert, you hit big. - Let's go back to the party, Kennedy. What you are offering me is a business risk. Now let me tell you my philosophy. I never take a risk. I don't need to, I'm a rich man. After the value of something is proven, I pay the price. - Don't you ever get shut out? - Never. (dramatic music) (phone rings) - Bannister here. - Cooper case is smallpox, without question. - Very well, prepare to move him. I'll have the isolation hospital opened immediately. Thank you, Blake. Margery. - Yes, Archibald? - Priority call. Get me World Health Geneva. - Superintendent Walters, Jamieson here. Smallpox case, patient coming in from London airport. Alert high emergency staff, will you? - [Man] Yes? - Drop everything, Tommy. We've got about a dozen inceptions. - [Tommy] Fire away. - Sergeant Parker, Copenhagen BA flight 308. - [Tommy] Already left, have to catch him on the other end, Copenhagen. - Enrico Jordano. (bell ringing) (jazzy music) - Ah, good evening. - Good evening. - One moment, sir. - It's all right, young man, no cause for alarm. Lock the door, Jamieson, no one in or out. My colleague and I are from the Department of Health. - That's a new one. Do you wish to leave or shall I call the house detective? - I warn you, we're here on government authority. This is too absurd. (jazzy music) - I am delighted to see you. Do enjoy yourselves. I am Ivonovitch. Please forgive my staff. Now what can I do for you? - We've already wasted enough valuable time, Mr. Ivonovitch. With your permission, I'll make just one announcement to you and your guests. - As you wish. (jazzy music) - Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to break up this delightful party, but it's my disagreeable duty to inform you on behalf of the Department of Health that a Mr. Cooper, the husband of a lady who is here tonight, has contracted smallpox. (gasping and murmuring) I gather that some of you are aware that smallpox is the most contagious of all diseases. Our only safeguard against this plague is vaccination. Not only primary contacts with the patient, but contacts of contacts. My colleague and I have come here this evening prepared to vaccinate you here and now. (murmuring) Please, will the ladies kindly remain here and the gentlemen assemble in the hall? (murmuring) Thank you, Jamieson. I'll do the ladies. Follow me. - Dr. Blake, would you sign clearance for the plane please, sir? - Fumigate these quarters next, then the others. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Wouldn't you prefer it on the thigh where the scar won't be seen? - What makes you think it won't be seen? (dramatic music) - Thank you. - What are Cooper's chances? - I wouldn't like to venture an opinion. - But he was vaccinated just before he left Dallas. - Vaccination doesn't always give complete protection. We run across individuals who can never be fully immunized, and other times the vaccine is found to be impotent or poorly administered. However, in most cases, vaccination is effective. - And when will I be able to visit him, Mr. Bannister? - Not until he's out of quarantine, I'm afraid. For the next week or so he'll be highly infectious. - What's happened to his luggage? - Being fumigated, everything in his possession. - There's one item I've got to get hold of. I know he brought it with him. - And what's that? - It's a drilling log, a long paper roll with a cloth back. The original chart of the Wahbar well as it was being drilled. You'll find it in a metal container. - I'll see you get it, good night, good night. - Thanks. - How does a man catch such a disease? - There are certain places in Asia and the Middle East where most cases of smallpox originate. South Wahbar is one of those places. You must excuse me, but the hotel staff's waiting in the ballroom. - Have a drink, Bannister. - No thanks. Actually no time for it. Sounds extraordinary, but in Nice and London we may reach 10,000 vaccinations by morning. No thanks, I won't have another. - What is your poison, Mr. Kennedy? - Bourbon straight. Do you have it? - It's already poured. - No thank you. - Come, all this gloom is nonsense. Let me arrange something with supper afterwards. What do you say, my pet? Now, If I know Cooper, he'd be the first to agree. - I think not, Nick. I'm not exactly in the mood. - Of course, of course. You've had a trying day, but you must eat. I'll send something you like down to your room. - It's very thoughtful of you, Nick, but I've really lost my appetite. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs. Cooper. - Goodnight, Edward. (dramatic music) - Hello, thought I told you to go home. It's well past one. What will your wife be thinking? - World Health rang back, Mr. Bannister. Two no incidents, Brussels and Zurich. - Any connection with our Cooper case? - Nothing from their side. - Got the details? - They're incomplete, sir, but it's all Geneva knows at the moment. - So I was foolishly optimistic this evening thinking that Cooper was a simple isolated case which we'd neatly bottled up. Get out the Cooper file and phone Sister Bryan. Tell her to send in all Cooper's things the moment they've been fumigated. They might give us a clue. Oh, and Jimmy, phone Mrs. Cooper and tell her I shall want to see her first thing in the morning. Mr. Kennedy as well. - Right, sir. - On second thought, you'd better go to bed. I'll make the call myself. - I could stay, sir. - No, no. That wife of yours will think you're gadding about. Tell me, is it that you're so extraordinarily attractive or that she's so extraordinarily suspicious? - I imagine it's a combination of both, sir. Goodnight, sir. (phone rings) - You heard the phone. It was Bannister. - About Steve? - No, but we must be in his office at eight o'clock in the morning. - Okay Michele, I'll leave an early call for both of us. Goodnight. - Could I trouble you for a cigarette? - On the night table. - What's bothering you? All night I hear you marching up, down, up. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - Perhaps it would help you to talk now. You got your cigarette. Now blow before you get into trouble. - What kind of trouble? - The kind you're looking for. - There is something bothering you. - Take off the mask, Michele, you're with friends. Steve may be my partner, but when it comes to dames, he isn't dry behind the ears. - And what is it like behind your ears? - Dry as cornflakes. You would, wouldn't you? - Would what? - Tell me, how does a little girl grow up into a cat like you? I'll bet you could purr a man off a steep cliff or claw him to death. - I don't know what you were trying to prove, but it was a delightful experiment. Goodnight, sleep tight. (groans) What is it, Beryl? - I'm scared, Michele. Nick says there's going to be an investigation. It's those horrid health people. Just because of some silly disease, they'll be asking all sort of questions. - But they have a right to ask. - Nick says if we mention the yacht, they'll find out about Bambi. Promise you won't tell. I'd die if they took him away. - So I won't mention the yacht. Now calm yourself and go to bed, hm? - You're sweet, Michele. It's all right, Nick, I told her. Nicky darling, you have two vaccinations. (gasps) - You talk too much, my angel. And you see too much. (dramatic music) - Nice of you both to come. You sit there, Mrs. Cooper. Do have a chair, Mr. Kennedy, will you? - Thank you. - These are your husband's valuables, Mrs. Cooper. The log you asked for, Mr. Kennedy. Don't worry, they've all been sterilized. - You boys do a thorough job, don't you? - We're dealing with a clever virus. During the night, two fresh cases of smallpox have been reported from the continent. The Zurich case is a death. Hans Ketner, an investment baker, of some prominence. Does that name ring a bell with either of you? - With me, no. - Never heard of him. Did you look through Cooper's papers? - We combed them carefully, not a thing. How about Marcelle Ramey, a research chemist residing in Brussels? - Should I know him? - Not necessarily, but if we could establish that Mr. Cooper did, that would help enormously. - I get it. You think Cooper met Ketner and Ramey and gave them smallpox. - Impossible, Mr. Kennedy. They couldn't have infected each other. - Even if they'd met? - Even if they'd met. - You lost me, pal. - Have I lost you as well, Mrs. Cooper? - I'm sorry. - Let me explain the elementary nature of the disease, otherwise neither of you will be of the slightest use to me. Point number one, smallpox is contracted by direct exposure to the virus, like a common cold or unlike, for instance, yellow fever, which can only be transmitted by a mosquito or sleeping sickness by tsetse fly. Which brings me to point number two, my dear Mrs. Cooper. Now, if I at this present moment were in your husband's condition, the contagious stage, I could pass smallpox onto you by merely being this close and breathing the word sugar. Do you take sugar, Mrs. Cooper? - One, thank you. - But the supremely important point is this. That you wouldn't fall ill or become dangerous to other persons until a future time, the time necessary for the germs to live and flourish in the warmth of your body. The time of incubation. With smallpox, we know this is approximately 14 to 16 days. So what have we? Three cases, Brussels, Zurich, and Cooper. All three struck down in a matter of hours and apparently no connection between them. A complete mystery except for one clue, a medical clue. Ah, have I found you, Mr. Kennedy? - You're saying all three had to catch it from somebody else who was already contagious. - Precisely, a fourth party. And when, Mrs. Cooper, did that somebody else contract the disease? - My husband two weeks ago and two weeks before that, four weeks. - You have a very receptive mind, Mrs. Cooper. - And you've given up the idea that Cooper caught it in Wahbar? - We had to. While it was the obvious answer in his case, it doesn't explain how Ketner and Ramey caught it. There's been no trace of smallpox in Europe for six months and we know that neither of these men left his own country during that period. Plus one further piece of evidence, Mr. Kennedy. Your partner's passport. It shows that he was making frequent trips from South Wahbar and always to the same place, Nice. Were you acquainted with that fact? - I got acquainted with it. - One of these trips took place 15 days ago, which forces us to this theory that in Europe somehow all three men contracted the disease from a common source, a carrier. Which brings me to you, Mrs. Cooper, and the approximate day your husband contracted the disease, April the second. The day we're almost certain that he, Ketner, and Ramey met the carrier. What could you tell me about the second of April? - It was the day of my marriage. - What a bit of luck. The events of such a memorable day must be very clear in your mind. Now, please start in the morning and take me with you hour by hour. - We left the hotel at noon. - Which hotel? The Negresco. - And you proceeded where? - (speaks French) To get a meet up from Nice. The mayor performs a ceremony. - I appreciate your conciseness, Mrs. Cooper. Any witnesses? - Only Ivonovitch and Beryl. - Then? - We were hungry. - Ah, the wedding celebration. Where did that take place? - At the Commodore. It was raining, we were the only guests. - I hope the meal was worthy of the occasion. - [Michele] It was five o'clock before we left. - And then? - We drove back to Nice, dropped Ivonovitch and Beryl at the yacht harbor and proceeded to our hotel. - On entering the hotel, did Mr. Cooper talk to anybody? - No, we went straight to our room. - Then what did you do? Allow me to rephrase the question. I meant your movements that night. Well, how can I put it? - As soon as we were in the room, Mr. Cooper received a telephone call. - From whom? - I don't remember. He only spoke a few words and shortly after that, he left. - He left you on your wedding night? Mrs. Cooper, if I weren't convinced of your straightforwardness, I should be inclined to disbelieve my ears. - I assure you he left me. - Where did he go? - He didn't say. - [Bannister] You must have some idea. - It is difficult to remember each little thing. - Try to refresh your memory. Was the call local or long distance? - I can't say. - Did it sound like a personal or a business call? - Business, of course. - What business does Cooper have in the south of France beside you? - [Michele] He didn't talk to me about things like that. - [Kennedy] And what made you say it was business at all? - The metal case with his maps, he took it with him. - Where? - He let the dog go to quarantine. He went to see Ivonovitch on his yacht. - And as far as you know, he came to the yacht alone and left alone? - As far as I know. Bannister, why don't you look in the hospital? This man whom you call the carrier, he must be very sick. - Or even dead. - Of smallpox? Surely such a death would be reported. - Not always. A doctor makes a faulty diagnosis and fails to recognize the disease. But dead or alive, we must find this man. - I wish I could help you. - When Cooper left, did you have the impression he was going straight back to Mrs. Cooper? - The new groom on his wedding night? Where else? - Where else indeed. And now I'd like to talk to your captain. - You'll find him on the bridge. - Thanks. - Sit down, Mr. Kennedy. A bourbon. - Straight. - I'd like a word with you. I'm a government official. - If it's about that perishing hound, it was not my orders that put it ashore. - My dear Skipper, I'm not from the dog's home. It's only your crew that concerns me. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bannister. - It's all right. Had any sickness aboard recently? - No, none. - Have you replaced any of your crew? - No. One of them's missing. - Missing? - The pilot of Mr. Ivonovitch's plane. Went into Nice one morning and disappeared. - When was this? - Oh, about two weeks ago. - Two weeks. Where's the airplane now? - Where it's supposed to be, in the hangar at Nice airport. - What do you think could have happened to him, Captain? - It's a puzzle. He's got a month's pay due. - Could you give me his name and home address? - Sure, Jacques Morell, Innsbruck. - Must have been important to drag my partner out on his wedding night. What was it all about? - I told you, it was confidential. - Did he have this with him? - Yes. - Did you look at what's inside? - Maybe you're right. Between partners there shouldn't be secrets. Cooper invited me to invest in South Wahbar. - Oh, so in your bathroom last night, I was talking to myself. Why didn't you stop me? - You were my guest. Whatever I am in business, socially I'm not so bad. I offered Cooper a personal loan, but he refused it. - Why should you lend him money? - Why not Michele's new husband? - You put it to him like that? - I explained it to him, I owed Michele a little something for services rendered. - Very generous of you. To accept money on that basis, a man would have to be in another trade. - Got 75 to the gallon. - What do you run this thing on, vodka? (honks horn) - Goes like a rocket, doesn't she? Pre-war finish. - Don't you people ever throw anything away? Drop me at the nearest taxi. - Wouldn't hear of it, wouldn't hear of it. Your hotel's on the way to my office. Missing pilot, interesting lead. - Your call to Innsbruck, Archibald. (phone rings) (speaks German) - Hello. (speaks German) - Please, Bannister, would you do me a little favor? Your accent is painful. Speak English please, will you? - I want you to help me trace a pilot named Jacques Morell. He's missing. - I'll send someone to investigate. What was the address? (speaks German) - Number five. - No word of any kind since the day he disappeared. The morning of April the third. (speaks German) Where are you going, Jimmy? - Wahbar legation sir, back in an hour. - South Wahbar? - Yes sir, just a routine matter. - Wait. Linkers, my point is that this pilot might be our carrier. He was in the yacht the night that Cooper visited Ivonovitch. Yeah, yeah. Ring me back as soon as possible. (speaks German) What routine matter? - Legation inquiring about sending a body back to Wahbar, sir. - What body? - Their minister's. He suffered a heart attack on Thursday. Didn't you read about it in the papers? - I didn't hear you knock. (knocks) - How long did you last with Ivonovitch? Or are you the one item he's holding on to for old time's sake? - Mr. Kennedy, I have a confession to make. I'm beginning to find you irresistible. - Drop it, Michele. When did Steve start to hit the bottle? - Began three days after the wedding. - Was that after he found out your were one of Ivonovitch's playmates? - If you really want to know, why don't you ask Steve? - I might just do that as soon as he's available. In the meantime, I'm warning you, I'm going to break up this ridiculous marriage. - Don't bother, Mr. Kennedy. It can't last anyway. Marriages are made in heaven and I've never been there. - You found out Steve's broke so you decided to call it quits, that's it, isn't it? - You're wrong about me, very wrong. - Am I? - Then why don't you straighten me out? - Perhaps I will one day. - What's delaying you, your union? - You. I like you, Mr. Kennedy. I like you a lot. Now get out of here and leave me alone. - One moment, Mr. Bannister. I will fetch his excellency. (dramatic music) - Oh, how do you do? (monkey noises) Oh. Do forgive me asking, but who is your tailor? (monkey noises) - Our Minister Designate, Mr. Rahman, Mr. Bannister. - Your excellency. - My apologies for keeping you waiting. (monkey noises) - Thank you. - You must excuse Mika. He has taken a curious liking to everything English. - Quite. - Will you come with me, please? The coffin is over here. - May I see the doctor's certificate showing cause of death? Thank you. Yes, this is quite in order. And now Mr. Rahman, could I examine the body? World Health Organization has an unsolved smallpox incident on its hands and... - What is the late minister to do with smallpox? - South Wahbar is an endemic area. And diplomats are always suspect. - Fahram could have had the disease without knowing it? - Indeed he could. Sometimes a smallpox carrier doesn't even realize that he's ill, complains of an ordinary headache. But while traveling around with a mild case, he can give it to others in its deadliest form. - My colleague died of a heart ailment. Furthermore, to disturb the remains would be sacrilege. - Forgive me. Thoughtless of me. There's a simple alternative. Could you supply me with a detailed account of the minister's activities during last month? No state secrets, of course. I really must insist. - Mr. Bannister, we have complied with all your regulations. The plane has been chartered, the body is scheduled to leave here at two o'clock. - I shall expect the shipping permit to be in my hands within an hour. It will be given our consideration, sir. (monkey noises) Thank you. You, sir, are a gentleman. - That Bannister is a ferret. He is demanding an account of Fahram's movements. - Let me caution you, Rahman. Bannister is not a predictable type of nuisance. He's a dedicated man. - He will get nowhere. I've dealt with petty civil servants before. Get me the foreign office, Sir Douglas Reed. - Yes, I know that, sir. But how can you examine the body without Rahman's consent? - More ways than one of killing a cat. Call McFarland of the coroner's office and ask him to recommend that the body be held for a blood test. - Oh, I see what you mean. (phone rings) Jamieson here. Yes, hold on, I'll fetch him. Mr. Bannister. Geneva returning your call, sir. - Ah. Bannister speaking. - I have those details you requested. Your supposition was correct. Ketner's banking house is connected with oil. They have controlling interest in three major companies. - How about Ramey, the research chemist? - Employed by one of Ketner's oil companies. - Than you. - [Geneva Employee] It's a pleasure. - Jimmy, we've found the common denominator. Get hold of Mr. Kennedy and tell him to get down here as fast as he can. What gave you the notion there might be oil in Wahbar? - It was Cooper's idea. A few years ago we persuaded British Independent to put up the bulk of the money for exploration. - And regarding to Wahbar, how did they fit in? - They granted us the right to drill with options that had to be renewed. If and when we struck oil. (spits) - [Jamieson] Too strong, sir? - Don't ever sneak up on me with that stuff again. - You were saying, if and when you struck oil. - Wahbar received 50% of the profits, British Independent 40, and the remaining 10 to Cooper and me. - Very interesting. Now what if I told you that Ketner and Ramey are in the oil business? - Are you making jokes? - I know they are. It's been confirmed by my counterparts in Zurich and Brussels. - Bannister, you've just exploded a stink bomb. We're going to have a few words with British Independent. There is oil in Wahbar and we struck it. Somebody's pulling me over swindle in Texas. The Remington scandal all over again. You remember the crew on that wild cat of theirs. Struck oil and filled the hole up again. With phony reports, they made it look like the well was dry. The Remington option on the land didn't expire for two years, but those thieves waited with their secret. Then they doubled back under the disguise of a new company and got rich. The government of Wahbar is working the Texas scheme on us. A few weeks ago Cooper asked Wahbar for an extension of the option. They flatly refused, want the money on the day or else. And I'll tell you why, they want our option to expire. Foster, there's one way to beat these pirates at their own game. Call your directors together, put up the dough, and renew the option. - No so fast. With you, Kennedy, it's conversation, with us it's money. - May I interrupt, gentlemen? A meeting has been mentioned between Mr. Cooper and the Wahbar government. To whom might Mr. Cooper have been talking? - We did all our negotiating with the London minister, Fahram, who died last Thursday. What's your point? - Assuming that it was he who refused Cooper, is it possible that on the very same day, Fahram flew to Zurich and Brussels, his purpose being a more profitable contract for Wahbar? - Is it possible, that's the way it was. You hear that, Foster? Even a guy in the germ racket can see it. What does it take to convince you? - A better story, Kennedy. There's a big flaw in your tale. How did they put it over on Cooper? Now tell me how they fooled him. - I can't answer that, I don't know. - Exactly. - Thank you, gentlemen. It may not resolve your sordid business mess, but if I can pinpoint a meeting two weeks ago between the deceased minister and Cooper, I may have found my carrier. (dramatic music) - Whoa! Trying to kill yourself? Watch where you're going. - Imagine the headline. Health official runs over healthy pedestrian. - What's the big hurry? - We're going to talk to your partner. - Let's make sure we get there. - Steve. Steve, it's me. Do you hear me? - Ed. - Go on. Did you see Fahram in Nice? Fahram, the Wahbar minister, did you see him? Nod if you did. (horn honks) - Any news from the coroner's office? - No word at all, sir, but Mr. Hatfield wanted to see you the instant you came in. - Good, now's your chance to prove that all Americans aren't ugly. - If I understand you correctly, Mr. Kennedy, implied in what you say is am monstrous accusation against the Wahbar government. - You get the picture. - They are deliberately trying to conceal a smallpox carrier to put over a nefarious oil scheme? - Oil is a precious commodity, Mr. Hatfield. This hasn't exactly been a game of Cricket. - Now let me tell you both what's happened. The foreign office has been onto me. We've had a sharp protest from the Wahbar legation about Bannister's attitude. - World Health has every right to inquire into the minister's movements. - That, Bannister, is a matter of opinion. The minister's death certificate reads carotid thrombosis, a non-infectious disease. - Doctors make mistakes. - And they're on all in coffins. - But the certificate is signed by Sir Henry Stanford. - I'd like to talk to Sir Henry. I'd remind him of the case of the army officer who slipped in the bathtub. His death certificate read fractured skull. Wasn't till after the body was exhumed that we discovered that he was also a carrier. - What are the odds against a repetition, five million to one? - 10 million to one. No stone should be left unturned. - All right, gentlemen, Ill go through with it. I know I'm mad, but I will. Get me Sir Douglas Reed at the foreign office. My word, if this misfires. (phone rings) Sir Douglas. Hatfield here. You were about to call me? Oh, topsy. I didn't know. Inedible. I quite agree. By all means. At once, goodbye, Sir Douglas. Well, it's misfired, Bannister, your attempt to force an autopsy. The coroner's request was refused. It would have been a direct violation of Muslim burial customs. Wahbar's pleaded diplomatic immunity, and as you appreciate, that puts an end to the matter. You realize, Archie, without concrete medical evidence, you never had a chance. I promised Sir Douglas that the shipping permit will be sent immediately. - I understand, sir. - I'm sorry, gentlemen. - You a golfer? - No, tennis is my game. - Linkers, sir. - Hello, Bannister? I'm speaking from the air vault. The situation is terrible. 11 cases of smallpox since this morning. - Damn it. - It's struck among the farms on the slope above the village, quite reasonless. - Halfway up a mountain and no explanation? - Is there anything new in London? Can you help us, Bannister? - No Linkers, I can't help you. Yes. I thought we were onto something, but we reached a dead end. Sorry. Yes, of course. (speaks German) - What do you mean we've reached a dead end? - You heard what Hatfield said, autopsy's out. Wahbar has invoked diplomatic immunity. That puts pay to the matter. - Only if you're a bookkeeper. Now what do you want to do, examine the corpse? - I'd give a year of my life. - Then be a man of action like the Lone Ranger. You know what he'd do? - What? - He'd snatch the body. - Snatch the body? You don't mean the Lone Ranger, you mean Al Capone. - [Kennedy] Okay, have it your way, Al Capone. - How? - There's always a way. Think devious. - Think devious? Jimmy. Find out who's supplying the hearse for the Wahbar Legation. Tell them that the corpse is suspected of being contagious and if they transport it, their entire premises will be closed down for fumigation. The idea is to scare them off. - Yes sir. - I like the way you operate, Mr. Capone. - The van ought to be here, the boys said one o'clock. - My part is the little woman would tell us what she knows, you'd find your carrier in a hurry. - Why should Mrs. Cooper withhold information? - Because she's covering up for somebody. - Like who? - Like Ivonovitch. He's the horse thief behind this whole swindle and I can prove it if I can pinpoint a meeting between him and Fahram. - How would you do that? - With Michele, that's how I'd prove it. - All right, bring her to my place. But remember, you'll treat that girl and you'll have Archibald Bannister to deal with. - Say, you're not warm for that iceberg, are you? - Rather. Under other circumstances, I wouldn't mind having a bash at melting her down. - Keep your blinkers on, Bannister. It's a virus you're after. (horn honks) - See you later. Remember the address, 14 Charters News. - And you remember it. We'll be that silly little scooter this time, so take it easy. - Silly little scooter? Do mind. (dramatic music) - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. You're not from the undertaker's. - No sir, Department of health. The undertaker's has broke down and we were asked to help out. - I see. - Not now, dear, later. I must ask you to go. (dramatic music) - [Kennedy] 14 Charters News. - What are you up to, Mr. Kennedy? You are so polite. - Who, me? - Helping me into a taxi and over the phone you almost sounded like a human being. - Don't you like human beings? - Of course I do, but in your case it terrifies me. To be honest, I'm afraid of you. - That's not a very nice thing to say. - I meant it nicely. I only wish I could... - Could what? - Oh, nothing. (dramatic music) - Aren't we going straight to the hospital? - Bannister wants us to pick him up. He got pressed for time. - He's such a sweet man. (dramatic music) (honks horn) (dramatic music) - Bear down, Constable. Oodles of room. - I've heard about London drivers. (horns honking) (dramatic music) - [Bannister] Handles quite well for a modern car. (dramatic music) - Quick as you can, Blake. - Mr. Hatfield, Scotland Yard calling. - [Officer] Scotland Yard here sir. We have just been informed that a coffin containing a corpse was stolen. It appears that the van used for this grab belonged to the Department of Health. - A Department of Health vehicle? You must be mistaken. Why should anyone make off... I'll look into the matter immediately. Where's Bannister? - He's at a luncheon engagement I believe, sir. - In a runaway van? I'd like to see you, Jamieson, in my office. - Yes sir. (eerie music) - All set, Blake? - [Blake] In a minute. - I thought we were picking him up? - We're going out from here in his car. - Ah, there you are. Come in, Mrs. Cooper. I must apologize, but my little motorcar has developed a carburetor cough. I've had to borrow a department van, but you'll find it quite comfortable. I wonder if you'd take a look through that window. We found a stray piece of luggage and it might be your husband's. Perhaps you could identify it. (gasps) - Into the house, Kennedy. That's all, Blake. Close him up again. The moment you get the lab report, phone Jamieson. Goodness knows where I shall be. The moment they're finished, you're off to the airport. When they question you, remember what happened. I was at the wheel, I drove you here. You tried to stop me but I insisted. There was a wild look in my eye. - [Kennedy] That lands you right in the soup. - Any other way and everyone will be in trouble. Leave it to me, and thanks. - [Kennedy] Right. - How dare you do that to me. - Between your feelings and the lives of hundreds, I had no choice. Did you recognize the corpse? His name was Fahram. - I'm not sure, let me think. - You recognized him, I can see it in your eyes. - You're mad, let me go. - You met him on Ivonovitch's yacht, admit it. - Steady, Kennedy, control yourself. - You idiot, you silly, stupid idiot. - Do you know what we were doing in there? Taking a blood sample. It will be some hours before we know the result, and time is precious. You could save us that time, Mrs. Cooper. - [Michele] How? - Have you ever seen Fahram with your husband? - With my husband, never. - Btu you have seen him. - I think so. Yes, at the Casino Nice some time ago. He sat next to Ivonovitch at the baccarat table. - [Kennedy] More than once? - Several times. - Ivonovitch, they're in this together, aren't they? - I can't tell you, I don't know. - I'm not buying that, Michele. - Hold on, Kennedy, you're barking up the wrong tree. Save your questions for Ivonovitch. - You won't find him in London. He flew out this morning. - Where to? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know, you're lying. - Damn you. His pilot was found dead. He went to see about it. - Pilot? - How do you know that and you don't know the rest of it? - Beryl told me when she came to say goodbye. - Give me two minutes with her alone. I'll find out where Ivonovitch went. - I know where. - You do? - To the village of Ehrwald, high in the Austrian Alps. - The coffin seized and broken into? Incredible. Outrageous. I can assure you, Sir Douglas, if Bannister's done any such thing, I'll take action immediately. Yes, I promise you, him and his head. Now Jamieson, I have a message for Bannister. That is, if you should just happen to talk to him. - Yes sir. - You'll find a taxi ride just at the end of the News. (phone rings) You're now at steamship line. - Abandon ship, sir. The police are searching for you everywhere. There's a warrant out for your arrest. - What's the charge? - Everything, sir, from body snatching to dangerous driving. - Dangerous driving? That's most ungenerous. Well contact Blake for the result of the blood test and the passport in the left hand drawer of my desk. Bring it to me. - At the pub, sir? - No, not at the pub. That's the second place they'll look. Let me think. Meet me at London airport on the balcony in the gent's loo. - What did you say sir? The lavatory? Are you quite sure, sir? - Yes, it's the safest place for an Englishman. Bye. (phone rings) This is it. - All we know is that a plane crashed up there some time ago. - [Bannister] What sort of plane? - We don't know. There's been a storm. It's buried in the snow. This is the first day in weeks that anybody could get up to it. - Have you identified the pilot? - No, not yet. They're bringing the body down now. - You'll find his name is Jacques Morell, the plane crashed exactly two weeks ago. - The missing flyer. (speaks German) I'll verify his identity at once. If you're right, then we have found our carrier. - Also I want you to locate a man named Ivonovitch who should be over there. - Ivonovitch, Ivonovitch correct? (speaks German) - If Morell is the carrier, what's your next move? - Routine, World Health goes into operation. Every contact the pilot made will be located and isolated. Vaccination barriers built. - Once it's established that Morell met Ramey and Ketner, that's all the proof I'll need. I'll nail Ivonovitch to the wall. - Sorry I'm late, sir. Had to make several diversions, I'm sure I was followed. - Let's have it, Jamieson, what about the blood test? - Negative. According to the lab report, pure as distilled water. - What now? - Don't look so upset, Kennedy. I've known for over an hour that the minister couldn't be the carrier. - But if he'd had the disease, it might have saved you your job. I'm afraid you've had it, sir. Mr. Hatfield said this time it is your head. - I can't say I blame him. Poor old Hatfield, I've given him quite a day. - [Woman] BEA flight 266 for Munich. - That's us, give me the passport, Jimmy. - This is madness, sir. You can't go on like this. - He who bolds the calms keep the calf. - Who said that, sir? - I did. - Come on, Bannister, come on. (announcer talking on PA) - This caper doesn't come off, I hope that Bannister runs the four minute mile, because you're going to have a lot of cops chasing you. - That's my funeral. - Sure, pal, sure. If my name's inside that hat, they might bury me with you. - Did you enjoy your stay in Britain, Mr. Cooper? - Great little country except the weather. - I could tell Foster now. Probably fool Cooper. - You sure? - Positive. Ivonovitch worked with Michele. She kept Cooper away from the well. Buried between the sheets. - Kennedy, I've never been prejudiced against Americans, but you're tempting it. You've behaved abominably towards that girl and now this vicious attack on her character. - You're kidding. - I've never been more serious. (dramatic music) - What if I told you she was Ivonovitch's mistress for over a year? - Don't be a self righteous humbug. - Boy, you've really got the hots. What do you think's going on with her anyway? - If I told you, you'd hate my guts. (bell ringing) - Linkers, Linkers. Was it Morell? - It was Morell all right. - Well? - But without smallpox. - What? - Every test was made all negative. - Just a minute, did you check the roof of the plane? - Course I did, it was hired in Nice on April third, flew to Brussels and Zurich on the same day and crashed on this mountain. But it all adds up to nothing. This just came from London. I'm going to Innsbruck for more vaccine. - Ivonovitch, what happened, what about him? - Not a sign, police are searching. (dramatic music) - [Kennedy] What's that? - Bell 47G, Franklin six cylinder. - I'll tell you what I think. The carrier was a passenger on the plane who was thrown clear. He's still buried in the snow. - No, we're not looking for a man any longer. We're looking for a thing. - A thing? What kind of a thing? - I don't know. Something Morell was carrying, a pair of slippers, a blanket, an article of clothing, anything. - Something Morell was carrying. - Uh-Huh. - Yet he doesn't have smallpox. What kind of a disease is this? - Damn tricky. In France in the city of Van, a father home from Indo-China imported the virus on pairs of pajamas. He bought them as gifts for his children. (dramatic music) - Do you mind? (speaking German) - What's he beefing about? - He's not beefing, they all talk like that. He says we won't find anything. The people around here are poor and the children looted everything the day of the crash, then the snowstorm closed in. I say. (speaking German) All right. Got a handkerchief? - Oh yes. - Tie it around your face. (dramatic music) - The true log of the Wahbar well. Enough oil to buy the bank of England. So that's what you didn't want to tell me. Why the milk drinker switched to whiskey. - Sorry, Kennedy. - What's there to be sorry about? You're talking to a millionaire. Here's a thing worth sending around. Look who certified it, Steven Cooper of Kennedy and Cooper. I can vouch for him if he says there's oil, there's oil. Nothing to be sorry about. All that happened to me was my best friend knifed me in the back. - Pity him, he wasn't cut out to be a thief. That's why he was drinking himself to death. - What can I say to him? We've been buddies for 15 years. I can't punch him in the nose. - Won't be any need for that. Cooper died. Bit nosy, isn't he? - [Kennedy] Ivonovitch! (dramatic music) - [Ivonovitch] I'll take that case. - The philosopher who never takes a risk. - Now that you know the truth, I hope you will be reasonable, Mr. Kennedy. - Reasonable, how was Cooper's price? - Considerable. He fancied himself an honest man. There are no honest man, only those who haven't been offered enough. What's your price? - Funny, I can't think of one. - Now, if you please, Mr. Bannister. - You don't understand, this is deadly. The virus is in the cloth backing of the log. Everyone who opened this tube was stricken. - The log? Contaminated, it's already killed two of your associates. - So that's how it spread. Then such a danger should be destroyed. We can burn it together, Mr. Bannister. - That won't do at all. This must go to a laboratory for verification. Supposition isn't good enough. - But it's not supposition. Cooper brought this to me on his wedding night. My pilot flew it to Ramey and Ketner. I knew long before you did they had smallpox. When you came to the party, I was already vaccinated. You could have noticed I gave you my right arm, not the left. - Careless of me, I thought you were left handed. - Fortunately I don't bother with details. Or I might have examined the log myself. - Pity you didn't. - Your case is closed, hand it over. - This must go under a microscope. It belongs to World Health. (dramatic music) - Your accidental death, Mr. Bannister, will be a loss to the world. You're not an ordinary man. I would not offend you by offering to buy your silence. But money is power. Think of the hospitals you could build, the good you could do if you had the means. - Bribery is terrifying. I understand what you did to Cooper. You know Ivonovitch, you're a carrier of corruption that may never be found. - You answer. - Now, anyone else for tennis? (upbeat music) - Archibald, with this thing you're a menace to society. - It was a gift from my mother. - Archie, you're an impostor. You walk around looking like there's nothing under that hat but hair. - Well, cheers. Oh absolutely, yeah. (horn honks) - The bus. Archie, come on, the bus. - No wait, no wait. - The plane. - Just a minute. Goodbye, Kinkers. - Linkers. - Of course, Kinkers. I say, what a splendid coat. - [Linkers] You like it? - What a beautiful coat, I love it. - It's yours. - Oh, so silly. - [Linkers] Come on, come on, I'm serious. (laughter) - Archie, it's absolutely you, now come on. - Goodbye. (upbeat music) - No thanks. I use the economy size. (laughter) (singing) - What made you so positive Michele was on the level? - When it comes to the female sex, science is useless. I navigate strictly by instinct. - She knew Cooper was double crossing her, didn't she? - That's all she did know. She didn't get around to telling you any more than I could. Don't forget, if it weren't for her, we'd still be in the dark. - You think she's quite a hunk. - Rich too. She owns half your oil field. Well, legally she's your partner. Oh, by the way, I sent her a cable and told her to pop into Cartier and pick out a little something in diamonds. - You're quite a man. - Oh, thanks. - Ah, sir. - Congratulations, Bannister. The whole story broke from Geneva. An ingenious piece of work. - Oh, thank you sir, piece of cake. - Mr. Bannister, how could you possibly solve such a complicated medical mystery in 48 hours? - Teamwork, one might say the motto of our department. - Quite. - Your cable was adorable. But the bracelet wasn't necessary. The necklace would have been enough. - I'm sorry madam, I'm afraid that's not allowed till he's been cleared through customs. - You double dealing bug chaser. You signed my name to that cable. - Elementary, my dear Kennedy. I'm glad you finally figured something out. Okay Bob, nothing to declare. - I may never forgive you for this. - Try. (woman talking on speaker) - Au revoir, Mr. Bannister. Thank you, cupid. - [Sister Bryan] Archibald. - Sorry. It's contagious. ♫ A matter of who but they tell me it's whom ♫ I tell them it's you, should I tell them it's youm ♫ And whether it's who or it's whom ♫ You sure light up a room ♫ 'Cause you always look good, but they say you look well ♫ And well that they did though it's good they can tell ♫ How happiness lays, is it lies ♫ Same thing otherwise why ♫ A matter of who ♫ A matter of you and me
