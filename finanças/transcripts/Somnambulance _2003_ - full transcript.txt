SOMNAMBULANCE Autumn 1944 Eetla... My feet are wet. Up to here. - What? I'm wet up to here. Where are your things? - Things. What things? Your bag and suitcase and... The things you had with you? Did you leave them in the boat? - Where was I supposed to put them? You told me to leave them. - I told you? I didn't tell you anything. I wanted you to get away from here. Did they give back the gold? The gold for the crossing fare? - I have to take off my skirt. - Listen! Did they give you back the money? - Me, why me? It was your gold, you were the one who paid. I didn't have time to ask for it back, did I? They had already pulled out from the shore. And you jumped into the water? - Yes, I did. So now what? You're going to stay here? You want to stay here? Why should I go to Sweden? Who's waiting for me there? - Is someone waiting for you here? - Of course not. You'll see. So let me. Let me see something. Anything! - Why are you shouting? - You're the one shouting. I am not. I'm talking very quietly. I'm cold. You understand? Put something on then. Dry yourself off and go back to the shore. Take it off, I don't want it. Father! Father! They are long gone! That was the last boat! I'm not going anywhere. That was the last boat. I don't understand anything anymore. When they come and get you, then... Listen! We can still escape. I dreamed that we were going... Do you hear me? Don't start with that again. And the boat came to meet us, came straight at us. We ran along the coast, you and I. We tried to run away, but it was still coming straight at us. Mother said we shouldn't be afraid, the water is warm... "We are all going for a swim now" She said that all dogs who couldn't swim will be shot. And one dog went under, staring at me like a human being... Eyes full of fear. The dog's eyes. I could not wait for it to drown. The lapwings were screaming like mad... They seemed like lapwings but weren't really. They were ducks but screeched like crows... I thought they were lapwings, that lapwings were screaming... Mother said of course they are lapwings. "It's a time of mourning after all. They are mourning" And I wanted to cry but couldn't... Wanted to scream with the lapwings... but no voice came, nothing came. Couldn't breathe... I couldn't breathe, could not and... Do you hear me, I was choking! I couldn't just stay in that boat... Do you hear!? Eetla. Open the door and come down. Do you want to see them rape me? Raping me, is this what you want to see? They'll set the house on fire so you can see better. - Eetla! I am a female, after all, like mother was. I heard everything, you know. - What was it this time then? Mother was screaming. I remember only that, only how... I felt... I felt... - Eetla! - Mother screamed... I felt like something was growing... Sometimes I still feel it growing inside me, growing and growing... Eetla! - You were there too and saw it. You saw! I saw nothing! - You saw and you heard... I didn't! - Liar! I didn't! - LIAR! I didn't hear! - Liar! I didn't! - Liar! You should put some iodine on that. - Stop staring. You are the reason we're stuck here. Mother wanted to leave way back then. When? In your dream again? Dreaming or awake, what's the difference anyway? For you, there isn't one. Not anymore. What happened? Where's the horse? Where did you leave the horse, tell me! Did you go to the village? - The shoe... - What shoe? - Mother's shoe! Out of her mind. Do you speak Estonian? Do you? Can you hear me? Have you got some ID? Tell me! Bloody hell! Do you remember when uncles came here from Sweden, with their wives... You brewed some of your strong beer and everybody got drunk and laughed... So funny when everybody's dead drunk, isn't it... It was mother's last birthday as well. I remember how she tore white feathers off her hands that night... and we watched her pulling all those feathers out of her sleeves. She was sitting on her bed wearing her wedding dress... looking so beautiful. Much prettier than in the wedding picture. The dress was open in the front so her breasts were quite bare... like she was going to nurse a baby. You asked why she was sitting there... with her bare breasts when there was no baby in sight. Then mother laughed so strangely and asked... "What's the difference? It's all a dream anyway..." and you are too stupid to get it..." Then I had to go to the toilet... and I saw you all sleeping the, on the floor of the living room. You and the uncles and their wives and... Only mother was missing. She had gone upstairs to her room, the door was wide open... and she was lying on the bed, stark naked, wearing only her shoes. The shoes the uncles had brought from Sweden for her birthday. I kept looking at her. Her skin seemed full of light... as if a candle were in her bladder, shining through her body. Like there was a full moon. Only the glow came from inside her. And was terribly beautiful, her lying there like that... I could not help staring at her... and I knew there was nothing I could do... I had to look at her, I wanted to look at how she had spread her legs a bit. Then mother opened her eyes and looked at me... as if she had known all along that I was staring at her... and asked if I thought her shoes were pretty. Christ almighty, they're here. You, clear off! Wait! If I get pregnant, by a general or two captains... what will people say? People in Sweden. A boat will come for me so I can give birth in Sweden... so I must dress up for that. Father won't come, the lighthouse is all that matters to him. I have to go alone. But I'll come back. I'll jump in the water and swim back to the shore. And father will be very angry and ask me where I left my things... and why did I leave the gold in the boat. And then he'll my feet till they're blue. He does that to all females who come back. That is why no one returns. I know that. I saw them all going. Going and going... Every single one of them. And I shouted at them... "Where do you think you're going? Straight into the sea" And I thought I would never see another human being in my life... that I'll be alone, forever a virgin. Let's go now. They were quite sensible men. Said nobody will be taken away. Only active supporters will be punished. We aren't supporters. We are the lighthouse keepers. They told us to keep watching our lighthouse. They won't touch the women. All rapists will be shot. That's what they said - rapists and supporters will be shot. Eetla! Eetla! Get down! Down! They burnt the boats... They burnt the boats... I saw it... The whole sea was burning. I was in the tower at night and saw them do it. Burned all the boats. Didn't you see it? Give me some light. Shit... He's going to bleed dry. What do I dress it with? There's nothing here. I've got a stocking. Let me. Wait! Pee on it, then dress it. Pee! It doesn't matter who does it. And make the bandage tight. I can't... Yes you can... You must! Stop that cranking. Come, come here. Eat up. The people in the jeep said nobody's allowed to the sea any more. And the boats will be confiscated. You'd better not look towards the sea at all. They said that if you see something... like someone escaping in a boat, you must tell report them. So the less you see, the better. One man did all the talking and the others just stood there. He asked me why I had not left. This Juhansen... Now we've got this Kasper Juhansen... The same doctor mother used to see in that hospital in town... How do you know it's Juhansen? It's him alright. I saw his papers... The same guy. It was his leg you bandaged today. With your mother's stocking... Juhansen. The light's out. What the hell! It's out! I'll shoot the bastard! Father! What are you doing? Wait! Wait, you can't. You can't do this, father! You keep away! Get off! It's the goddamn gas! Give me some light! Give me some light! Do you hear me!? Here! And here! This is for wanting to rape me! For sleeping with my mother! For wanting to kill you, you bastard! For you wanting to kill yourself! You know, I dreamed that... Winter So, what are the voices saying? Well, did they say something? - No. No point in messing with the radio for your spying. These are the last batteries. - What spying? - You know what I mean. They come and take you to your little wife. That would be nice, wouldn't it? - It would be very nice. Father doesn't want you to smoke here. Reminds him of my mother. Mother started smoking when she returned from the hospital, from you. One cigarette after another. Didn't do a thing, just smoked and warmed her feet. Father said it was low blood pressure that makes her feet so cold. The pressure was low because of all that smoking... and smoking is due to nerves and nerves due to low blood pressure. Mother never listened. Sometimes said that it's no wonder her feet were cold... she lived by this gloomy sea and always ate fish. She kept saying how she wanted sunshine and dry land... where people drank red wine. For thirst! Not like here... where it's just communion wine, and even that's watered down. Then she said...mother, I mean... that she had dreamed she was at a dried out salt lake... looking for the post office. Wanted to send us a letter about how... she wasn't coming back here to gut fish and freeze. That she could finally go where she wanted and she would do just that. Father said it must be a nice place indeed... but won't she be bored, having everything she wants? Mother said she won't. Started shaking her head. "No, no, no" Then father shut up. He knew what the head shaking meant. And mother shut up as well. Just sat there for a while and then said that... the only thing she would still miss is the squalling of the birds... She would only miss the screaming of the seagulls. Somnambulance... The old man is back. I'll write down where I found them and whose things these are. The chimney bricks are the only things left in the village. They sure know how to stoke a stove. They've burnt down all the houses. Steal them clean and then set them on fire. Only the outhouses are still standing. When people start coming back, they'll have nothing left. Not even a roof. If they come back. Seven. Of course they will. This outrage will be over by spring. In the autumn you said it'll be done by winter. The winter is not over yet. Twelve and some. Did you have a look at the dinghy near the boat sheds... or will you wait until that's burnt as well? - Twelve. I'm not waiting for anything. Maybe someone else here is. If that someone wants the dinghy, let them come and ask me. - Then I'll go myself. - The one who needs it should go. Kasper is not going on his own. They might be spying on the beach. There's nothing to spy on. All the boats are gone. Your boat is there. Not anymore. - Where did it go? - Doesn't matter. And stop asking about the dinghy. Let him go and look for it himself if he's so desperate. I won't get far in this old thing. Seal hunters cross over to Finland in dinghies all the time. - But I'm going to Sweden. - You'll go through Finland first. Through Finland? They extradite refugees. Why didn't you remain a doctor? You could still be a doctor and give advice to women. - What advice would I give them? - Whatever they happen to need. Mother told me about it. Even the easy girls who worked the nights in the barracks... and then came to you to empty their wombs. Even they remembered the doctor's hands. You remember their faces, don't you? - I don't. - Didn't you look at them? Not like that. Then how did you look at them? Like a doctor. Were they all the same down there? Yes, they were. And yet, they weren't. - Can you remember any of them? - Some. Mother... - She was... - What was she? She was what she was... But she definitely was. She was crazy. Crazy about you. What am I supposed to say to that? Nothing. They were all crazy. All your patients whose crotches you groped. Falco tinnunculus... Nicely drawn. And accurately as well, which is most important. Kasper had a look at your cow. It's time to take her to town. He said if she doesn't want the bull now, she never will. - What did you say? - I said to take the cow to town. Right you are. Maybe as soon as tomorrow? A long way for the animal to walk. But there are no bulls nearby, so it can't really be helped. Yes, you better go tomorrow. And if she still won't have the bull... sell her for meat and buy new batteries for the radio. And we're out of needles. They're all in the stuffed birds and I can't get them out. Well, enjoy the food! Thanks. No news from Sweden yet? - Silence. - It's the dinghy then. - Looks like it, yes. Just mind you don't leave any traces near the lighthouse. You can have my old skis. Not the new skis, but the old ones are good enough. Bless you. And keep away from the girl. Wait. Lyon. Strasbourg. Antwerp. - Antwerp. - Odessa. - Yes. - Then comes Bratislava, Paris, Athens, Istanbul. - Stockholm. - Stop there, let's listen to that. When mother left us and ran off with her officer... she said they were off to Sweden. So if you meet her there, tell her that Eetla, her daughter... sends her regards, that she's still a virgin. Tell her that the soldiers are already eyeing me up. How long will I last like this? And make sure to tell her that... I didn't let you near me, however much you wanted to me. Father thinks you've already had your way with me. That's why he keeps his gun close by. He'll shoot you if my belly starts swelling. I hardly dare eat because of this. That's why I want you to leave. Before my patience runs out... and you force yourself on me and rough me up. That's why father will shoot you... Because he can't stand blood. That's why you'll kill each other. I even had to shoot the dog because you two can't stand blood. I want to tell you something. Estland. You see, when you leave... Kvinna. When you leave and I stay behind alone, then... Legare. Vent?r. Nordkappen. I don't want to. Damn it. I can't hear, damn it! I don't want to. I don't want to. One of them is already lurking around here, the mute one... He'll be the first. Against my will, and all the others after him... I don't want this, do you hear!? I don't want this! I'm not to be touched! Eetla! - I am not to be touched! - Please! - Not now! - Eetla! I don't want to! Do you hear me!? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking that...I don't really understand it. What don't you understand? - It doesn't matter, really. - What doesn't matter? What you said... What did I say? That you are a virgin... I'm not. Not any more. It does matter. - What? That I'm no longer a virgin. - You already weren't one. - Yesterday evening I still was. No one has touched me... before you. You didn't feel any pain, did you? Then he raped me... - Who? - That soldier, the mute one. He called me a pretty girl. Asked me to...you know what. He wrote...first in the snow, then in the air...I read what he wrote. He had a dog with him. It wanted to tear me to pieces, but he locked the dog in the car.
