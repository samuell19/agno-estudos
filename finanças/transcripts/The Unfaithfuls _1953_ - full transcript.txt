Please, come in. - Yes? - I'd like to speak with... - The manager! - Yes. - Take a seat, I'll tell him. Please, sit down. - What is it? - It's a distinguished gentleman. A distinguished gentleman?! Then clear everything up! Cut that radio off! Rednecks! - Then? - Go! - Shall I open? - Yes! Please, sir, come in. - Good day. - Cantagalli! Please! How can we help you? It's about gathering private information about a lady. We'll do everything with the utmost discretion. - Please be discreet! You understand... - This is a serious agency. Discretion is law for us. - It never happened to you before... - True, is the first time... The first time is always like this. Your name? - Why? - lsn't it for you that we must investigate? Azzali. - How? - Azzali. Azzali... - Giovanni? - Yes. - Azzali Giovanni? - The one with the cheese? - Yes. - The lady is your... - My wife, yes. - Have you got elements... - I've got suspicions. Doubts even, and reasonable ones. But it's difficult, without a clue... - Money is not a problem. - Our fees are honest ones. We care about our clients! Please. A signature, please. Here people coome back again and again... A photo could be useful recognizing her. - But it should be a recent one. - It's very recent. Let's see. What a beautiful lady! - Then? - I'll pass it to my agent. I got the right person. Do you want me to call you every night? No, I prefer to come back here. I'll be back in one week, and you'll tell me what happened. Let's hope everything works up fine, I mean bad! Fellow, show the Commendatore out. Hello? - I'll call him. - Who is it? - It's for Mr. Osvaldo. - What a nuisance this phone is! Mister Osvaldo! Mister Osvaldo! - What is it? - Phone call, the boss. I'm coming, thank you. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Is it done? I know, but you must hurry! A new client! A very rich Commendatore. The wife... Very beautiful woman, classy. I chose you 'cause, even if a scoundrel, you can get in certain circles. - Good evening, is it a party? - You also a reporter? There's a party for the English commercial mission, I should make pictures, but I can't even get in, I need an invitation. Let's see. - Can l? The press. - No, I told it to the photographers. - Come on... - I got explicit dispositions. - Go away! - Don't raise your voice! Liliana! - Osvaldo! - Can I have a ride? - Sure. Osvaldo! - You haven't changed too much. - We haven't seen each other in years. A lot of years. From '44. - It's strange meeting like this. - I thought you were in London. My husband has been transferred in Rome, he's waiting for me. I'm late, the maid is making the last stitches to the cloak. You're one of the jet-set now that you've married an English. - How is it going for you? - I write, newspapers, special correspondent, I'm here for an article. I've written to you once from London, but maybe I put a wrong address. It wasn't wrong. - You didn't write back? - No. - Is that one your lord? - He's only a trade expert. - Thanks for the ride, have fun. - Bye. - Is it possible you're never on time? - The dress came late. - Here's the cloak, madame. - I had to take Cesarina along... Now you're taking her to receptions? Haven't I tolerated her enough in London? - Henry, I've already explained. - Who was that guy? An old acquaintance... Bye, Cesarina. Good evening. Stopped the car in Piazza di Spagna, Condotti st, bought belt. Got back in the car and home. - That's all. - No meetings, no phones... - Nothing. - Your wife is above all suspicion. - Like Caesar's! - Caesar's was ugly! Luisa's not a child anymore, but... You tell me, isn't she a pleasant woman? - Of course! - Then why? They all have a lover, why hasn't she? To spite me, that's why. - I thought your jealousy... - After a 1 0 years marriage! It's impossible there's nothing! - Why? - Let's speak like men. It's two years since between me and my wife... Can it be, a young woman, with all those young men around, courted like she is? - My wife has noticed you. - Has she? She mistook you for an admirer. I need a pretext so I can get a divorce. I want to be able to get a divorce without having to pay alimony. We can go on following her, insisting! No, it's useless! It should happen to me having a faithful wife! Something must be done. She must be provided with the oppurtunity of cheating on me. It's not easy finding the right person. - Would you want me to try? - You? You said she has already noticed me. She might be curious to know who I am, seeing I'm not from her circle. How will you get introduced to her? - I can't introduce you. - I know a lady who could do it. - Who? - Mrs. Rogers, the wife of a trade representative. Yes, yes, I know her. It's fine by me, maybe you're right. You're nice, you look well... try. A phone call, I catch you and that's it. Of course, I'll reward you, I'm a gentleman. That was understood. - We'll strike a deal. - No, right away, is better. - Shall we say 300 thousand? - Alright! Here's an advance. - In what name? - Dr. Giulio Cantagalli. Thank you. Done. - Then... succes. - I'll show you out. Good-bye! Have you gone mad! This is dangerous stuff, this is a serious agency. We've got a licence from the police! - And then, who's this Mrs. Rogers? - I really know her. You know her? I've known her for ten years. Her name was Liliana Capacci. We were living in the same building, we even were engaged. Really engaged, with rings bought while staring in each other's eyes. - How come she married the Englishman? - Like all the others. I was taken prisoner, the Allies came... A few cheap presents and she got married. But she made a life. She could be useful even to you. We'll see... Waiter? - Where's she? - She's coming. Of course, sir. - I can only stay for one minute. - lt'll be enough. - T ea, dottore? - Yes, I'll be leaving right away. Two. - Dottore? Since when? - Years, now! - You didn't like studying! - Life changed me. For the better? - Couldn't have for the worse. - It could have. - I've thought a lot about you. - Has your husband given you the time to? Days are long in England, other people, other language. I spent my afternoons crying with nostalgia. - Nostalgia for what? - For the sun, my house... and us. So many years have gone by... The last time we saw each other it was in Naples, remember? You were embarking. We spent the whole day together. And the whole night. The other day I wanted to take a wallk by myself. I felt like rain and fog was still stuck to my bones. In 300 meters three men approached me. And that's when I understood I really was in ltaly. You're looking at my wrinkles? Useless looking for them. You're more beautiful than you used to be. Make no compliments, years go by, and what was, was. Alright, no compliments. I wanted us to meet 'cause I need a favor. Will you introduce me to Mrs. Azzali? - The wife of the one with the cheese? - Yes, she. I've only just met her, we're meeting on Thursday for the treasure hunt. - What's that? - A game played by couples. You have to find a treasure hidden somewhere in the city. Could you put me in a couple with her? - Passion? - Curiosity. And it seems th ehusband is many newspapers and for a beginner... I understand only too well. - Do you find her beautiful? - Mrs. Azzali? Maybe not beautiful... But exciting. It's true. Have to go away, I'll let you know at what hour is the meeting. - I'll accompany you. - Where can I phone you?At home? I live in a hotel. Call me at the newspaper. At Lince agency. - Everything alright? - Very well. - If you like it, next time I can call you count. - Dottore is alright. - Everyone has the enevelope with the riddles? - I don't! - Here it is. - Thank you. - Liliana, who am I going with? - Wait. You're with Rodolfo Lanari. - Hi Liliana! - Lulla! I'm sorry for being late. Have you seen my husband? He was here just now, he was looking for you. Elena Mossi and Sandrino De Bonis! I'll be grateful the day you won't be late anymore. It's not my fault, it was the child! - Since when does she care about children? - About 20 years ones, since always! - Doesn't the husband see anything? - He's covered up to here in debts. Mrs. Azzali and dottore Dalpra. - Here I am. - Dottor Dalpra, mrs. Azzali. - My husband. - Glad to meet you. I'll let you in my place, don't let my wife drive, she's a very poor driver. - Please. - Thank you. Take care, please. Osvaldo, the envelope. Good luck. Watch my signal! When I lower the scarf, you start! - What does it say? - Go on the Pincio, Galileo's bust. - Alright, we'll rush for it. Do you trust me? - I always trust women. - That's bad! - Who knows! Ready? Go! I'm first. Let's go, quickly! Quickly, we're in second place! - We must take a driver's cap and two boots. - My driver's, at my home! - Is there another phone? - There, sir. Hello? Hotel Pincio. What room? Right now. Marisa, the phone! Yes? Nino! It's the old man! My love, I'm telling you everything, so you'll be happy but you must promise me not to tell it to anyone. With whom could I speak, honey? I'm in the hotel the entire day. I don't see anyone... Yes. Here. That's it. Nino! He divorces, he marries me. - When, where? - In the church. - You don't divorce in the church! He's a smart guy, he already got in couple with her and you'll see... Hello? Hello, commendatore? The mother's on the phone. We need your cap! Here it is, take it! If I were you, I wouldn't take it off. Take your boots off, quickly! - They're too big for the gentleman. - Why? They'll fit very well! Come on, Carlo, quickly! Come on! Put them in the car, I'm sure Taylor is already ten minutes ahead. Hello? Yes, it's me. How are you? - Who do you know it? - I'll tell you afterward. It's you that introduced Osvaldo to Luisa. It seems Azzali wants to catch them and make a scene. Poor guy, who knows how he'll end up. Alright, I got it. I'll try to warn him, thanks a lot. - Cesarina! - Ma'am? Leave it! - Anything the matter? Bring me the phone book. I need the number of the Lince Agency, it's a news agency. Come on, bring it here! Quickly, sit down. I've told you not to leave the jewelry around, there's a jewel box for that. - This was in the tub. - I was so tired yesterday. There's no need for you to do it, there's the maid. Now, please, clean this hat. You know very well I've never liked your intimacy with the maid. - What intinacy are you talking about? - How she talks to you, hangs around you. Do you remember there's cocktail at the embassy today? - I'm not going. - You must come, it'd be rude. - I'll come with you next time, please. - Alright, dear, as you wish. - He simply can't stand me. - Forget it, let's find that number. Hello? Lince Agency. No, he's not. What hotel, he stays on Scanderbeg st, nr. 58. Hello? Thank you. - A lady's looking for you. - A lady? Yes, a real lady. You, get out of here! Out! - Excuse me. - You must excuse me. Come in. No, leave it, it's hot. - I'm sorry you find me like this. - It doesn't matter. - Sit down. - I didn't mean to bother you. - Where did you get my address from? - I called the agency. You got me! It's not the proper milieu for receiving Mrs. Rogers. Maybe it is not bad for you to repair with poverty, it brings backyour beginings. - Don't use this tone with me. - I did use another one years ago. But, when I look at the results, I had no succes. I never did have succes, I didn't graduate, nothing. I've begun with loosing the war, and I got used to losing. - Osvaldo... - Buut it's been different for you. The women are quick in geting on the winner's side. They marry him. Better luck next time, maybe I'll meet some woman General. - Why, you think I'm happy? - Don't start complaining, now! Leave that to me, together with the debts at the washerwoman and the late rent. Since I've lost you I haven't been capable of doing anything. But I'm here, Osvaldo, and I'll do everything possible to repair the wrong I did. Look at me. I didn't come here to catch you... I found out someone's setting a trap for you and I wanted to warn you. - What trap? - Azzali, with you and his wife. He wants to catch you in the act, and raise a scandal. - And then get a divorce. - Who told you? Everybody knows it, except Luisa and you. My poor Liliana! Look at me! I have a deal with Azzali. He pays me! When I get where I am, means don't count anymore. - But then... - I'm not interessed in Mrs. Azzali. It was about business. I shouldn't have left you! It's my fault if you have arrived to this, but I'll help you. We'll find a good job, I'll talk to my husband. - Has everybody arrived already? - Long ago, madame is entertaining them. - But the cook... - I haven't asked you about the cook! - I'm sorry for being late. - Hi dear, at last! - Dear commendatore... - Hello, Henry. What's the matter with you? I've known you since childhood, and you have never been late. The Romans will teach me how to be late. When they set a meeting for 5, it means you'll find them around 7. The Romans have so many virtues, the can afford a few vices. I want to introduce you to that cousin l was talking to you about. - My husband, dottor Dalpra. - An honor. My wife talked to me about you, I'd help you with pleasure, but my semi-official position forbids me to accept recommendations. You could have chosen another moment to talk about this! - Lunch is served. - Excuse me. - It's rude saying it aloud. - He did it on purpose to humiliate me. Ingegnere? - I want you near me the entire evening. - I have no other desire. - I have a favor to ask you! - Consider it granted. That's what I can offer you, it's little, but it's a first job, after all. You must start with 0 if you want to get at 1 00. If you'd know how many rough jobs I had when your age, young man. Necessarily... I'll be waiting for your answer, take your time, there's no hurry - And salute Mrs. Rogers. - Good-bye. - Forgive me, he wouldn't let me go. - So? I owe it all to you. - Osvaldo! - It's a splendid position, and it pays! - I didn't hope for it. - I'm so happy! I'd also be, but, unfortunately, it is not possible. What are you talking about? A poor guy, after years of poverty and bad luck gets a good job. It'd mean happiness, but then they tel him it's a job of responsibility. They want a security, a deposit of 200,000 lire! Would I be here if I had 200,000 lire? - Take me home, please. - When must you make the deposit? - Tomorrow, they are in a hurry. - I'll give it to you, the dressmaker will wait. - Have you gone mad? - It's a lone, you'll give it back. - If it's a good wage. - Yes, but that's almost the double. - You'll give it back in two or three months. - No, I couldn't. Se mi amassi ti sembrerebbe una cosa naturale. No, we're in the middle of the street! - No mail. - Better this way. - I'll leave the key here. - Why? Ah! Hello! - I hope I'm not intruding. - The commendatore is angry! - And he isn't wrong. - And what can I do? You haven't kept your promisse! It's been a month you've been going with my wife, what's between you? I'm sorry to say this to you, but there isn't anything. - What do you mean nothing? - Nothing. Nothing nothing? Too little for an exigent husband like you. But you were bound to keep your word! - I've paid for this! - I wouldn't brag about it. - Now you're throwing it into my face. - No, but it isn't my fault it didn't work Luisa likes you a lot. Really? This reassures me, you know, times go by for all of us. - Cut the crap out! - You're right! I'm leaving, my conscience refuses this kind of filth. - Strange words in your mouth! - And how about in yours? - Swindler! - Turn me in, moron! - Go tell you paid me to make love to your wife. - Get out! You'll come looking for me. Good luck. - Scoundrel, swindler! - Keep calm. It's a luck I've got someone else... No, from now on, I'll chose who works for me. - Can I use the phone? - Yes. From tomorrow we'll put a sign saying the phone is for customers only. Would you like me to be your personal client? Yes? Madame is not at home, what should I tell her? Alright, Mr. Dalpra. - Dottor Dalpra. O, he. No, I'm not at home. Cesarina, wait... It's better I talk to him, transfer it. Liliana, it's been an hour I've been waiting for you. What? You aren't coming? You won't come anymore? What happened, I don't understand. You've talked to the ingegnere? Don't talk like this! There's no cheating nor abuse! If you don't let me talk! Let me explain to you. With that money I made a golden deal. Yes, I'll prove it to you. Instead of the charity the l'ingegnere condescended to offer me! Yes, but it was too difficult to explain it to yoy. You want the proof? Tomorrow I'll give you back your money. I'll bring you a check. Listen to me! Hello, Liliana? - We've lost again. - Of course! We're invincible! Your husband couldn't hit not even a ball! Winning with a partner like yours is easy! I know I owe it all to him. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Thank you for the surprise call. How come? You appear and disappear like a comet. - Have you been drawn by other stars? - It wasn't my fault. No need to be sorry, you're free to do and go where you wish. Even in prison. And that's where I'll go, if you don't help me. How? I need money, I'm in trouble. - I'll give it back as soon as I can - I wouldn't have believed it. I was told you were a scoundrel, an adventurer. So this is your profession, isn't it? Extorting money out of women. - Go away! - One moment. Someone talked to you about me. Who was it? - Your driver? - What do you mean? You know it. That mrs. Azzali has her driver as a lover! Shut up! It's absurd! Yes? This is the copy of a rental contract. The Monteverde villa where you often meet with your "Battista". These are the depositions of the concierge and of the other lodgers. Precious documents for your husband who's been looking for a proof for two months. He'd pay millions for them. Instead, I'm not giving them to him, but to you. I'm better than you thought. Scoundrel, how musch do you want? Very little. It's humiliating for me. Only becuase I'm in trouble... 300,000, the minimum I can do with. Tomorrow I'll leave a check here with the caretaker. Thanks and excuse me, I'll give it back as soon as I can. - They are not at home. - What a liar! - Madame is not at home for anyone. - But I am Osvaldo Dalpra. - Funny guy! - Announce me. - But if l... - Try! Alright, come in here. Take a seat. Come in. It's Mr. Osvaldo. I told him you were not at home, but he insisted. I don't want to see him, send him away. Yes, madame. - Madame is not well. - I'll be quick. - But I had said... - I came to bring you back the money. I dislike it you thought I could have cheated you. Thank you. I made a good deal. Farewell. Mr. Osvaldo! Madame wants you. Cesarina! - Yes? - Have you gone deaf? I rang 1 0 times. - I was dressing madame. - And you aren't you ready yet? I'm sorry... Iet's go. You forgot the necklace. Aren't you wearing it tonight? We couldn't find it, and I didn't have the courage to tell you. - How can it be missing? - I didn't say it was missing! I just can't find it. Did you lend it to a friend?To Lulla Possenti? You sometimes lend her the fur. - No! - Must find it! I don't want you to appear like this. We'll look for it afterward, calmly. - Even like this I won't shame you. - But it's an important reception! Does it diminish your decorum if your wife doesn't wear those jewels? - You can't understand. - You gave them to me so I'd be decorous! Let's go! What have you got to say? You always talk, and now you're silent. - You wouldn't suspect me... - Enough, search everywhere! - Let's go, it's late. - When we come back, I want it found! You must find the necklace! - I'm leaving! - I'd never suspect you! - But Mr. Rogers does! - He doesn't know you. We've spent so many sad days in London you and l. We were like friends, I'd rather suspect myself than you. Don't make a scene, because I didn't accuse you. I only want to understand. - I'm entitled to, am I not? - Yes, you're right, but... Look into my eyes. Who has been in the house recently? I want all their names. Except the cook who never leaves the kitchen, who has entered this room while I was out? Who would you expect to have entered, only I and the maid. Then I need what needs to be done. - What are you doing? - DI'll repiort the theft of the necklace. - It's nonsense to say it's disappeared! - They'll suspect Cesarina. She'll be the first to be suspected, and once at the police she'll soon be charged. - I'm sure you'll repent. - Your italian sentimantality! - You don't want to punish one who's guilty. - What proves have you got? She might have left her at the dressmaker, or in the taxi. I'm leaving, madame. How can such a good girl be suspected like this? - You can stay, but only for the night. - Not even one minute longer. You thnk I'm a thief, search me, maybe I'm taking something. Enough. Please, stay. Thank you, madame. You've humiliated yourself enough, and me also. Come. And don't make that face or I'll be sorry I didn't denounce her. - Whom do you want? - Is dottor Dalpra in? Mother, it's for mister Osvaldo. - He doesn't live here anymore. - Since when? Since three days ago, he didn't tell where he was going, he decided suddenly. Thank you. - You're right, but what could I do? - You should have called the police. - I'd have left anyway. - Is it possibile to be driven away like this! - I'll tell you what you should do! - Stop it, madame's coming. - Where have you slept? - In a hotel. - You were withh someone? - Yes, he's my fiancee. - Take it. - No! - Come on, take it. Thank you. I only wish... you'd only help me get another job. I'll talk tomorrow with one of my friends who wants to change her mais. Thank you. Have you searched for the jewels? - Yes, all morning. Nothing. - I'm sorry. And Mr. Osvaldo? It's been a few days since I haven't seen him. Thank you for everything. Call me the day after tomorrow, I'll let you know. - Good-bye. - Bye. Being nice to one's maid is fine, but now they're exagerating. Once they used your perfume, now Francesca copies my dresses... .. and flirts with my bridge friends. Silence, here she is! Excuse me, dear, you do the math. Come. - It's unheard of. - They might even use our toothbrushes. Or our husbands. Excuse me, I'll dress right away. We must go to the theater! - Carla, I've got a good maid for you. - Who is she? - She used to be mine. - Send her to me. Why has she left you? Myb husband didn't like her, but she's a good girl. Lulla's husband came, she's not here and he got mad. - I don't know anything! Did you tell him she left 1 hour ago? - I didn't notice. Liliana you tell him Lulla has just left and they'll meet at the theater. - Yes. - Where could she have gone? Who knows, maybe with one of her usual boys. - Do you know who he is? - I've tried to find out. But Lulla's a sly one. - What time is it? - 20,30. O God, the theater! It's the opening tonight. - How long does it take to get back? - A few minutes My bag? I've forgotten it down there, I'll go pick it up. - What a carnage! - But it's his fault! Easy, he's in pieces! Rise him! Get in, madame. Hospital porters, quick! You've got a wounded! Here we are! Quickly! - What happened? - He was run over. I'm sorry, dear, the dressmaker was late, and I had to wait for her. - How is it going, my dear? - Very well. Let m eintroduce you to a new friend, Mr. Berti. - Glad to meet you. - You'll like him, I met him in Milan. He's really cute! Excuse me, I have to say hello to someone. I'll be right back. - So, you're a cute one? - I do my best. - Then? - I'm making another try. With that one? - Liliana! - It's you! I was sure I'd find you here. - You haven't called for a week. - Yiou were never at home. - I've looked for you, but you've moved. - Now I live in a guest house. I made some good business. What's the matter? Are you angry with me? Something nasty happened to me, I went through some awful days. I'm sorry to hear it, what was it about? Some very valuable jewels have gone missing. How did it happen? Your friends are very moved, what happened? - Who told you? - I read it in the newspapers. - Guido Luci has had an accident. - He's dead! - Ran over by a truck. - Where did it happen? - On Via Aurelia. I don't know how it happened, butthere was a woman with him. - What's the matter, madame? - Nothing, accompany me to the bar. - How are you, chief? - So and so. - Glad to meet you. - Get in. - I wondered how you did end up. - I have about you. - I even called the agency. - I've shut it down, it didn't make much. You seem to be doing fine! - Is this yours? - Almost. You pay the first installment, then sell it for cash. You buuy another one in installments, and so on. - Arguing with me brought you a fortune. - I did all on my own. I found the key: first, avoid the poor and the unhappy. Bad luck rubs off. Second: don't work, but make the others work. That's the principle that makes the world go round. Third: live only where money piles up, that means among women. Women pile up money, men only make it. - I g ot it, you're supported. - No! As a matter of fact, I let some ladies know that I posses private information... - And you blackmail them! - Don't be vulgar! They deserve it. Ladies seemingly beautiful and respectable, are almost all of them avid, liar, unfaithful. I want to ask you something. I tooko a job with another agency, so I could make a little money. - I have to write a piece on tonight's party. - At the Bellaris residence? Yes, but I don't know anyone. Are you going? I haven't been invited, but I can describe it for you. Their parties are all the same The Bellaris residence... The ample garden is provided with a state of the art swimming pool. The guests are coming. The same names, the entire phone book seems to be here. On the threshold, faking enthusiasm, Carla Bellaris. 34, admitted, years, 42 lived ones. In the afternoos she took a cucumbers mask to loosen the wrinkles. Lulla Possenti, who has the mania of showing up in high-society, forcing her husband into debts. But she 's a sweet woman, submitted to her husband and lovers. Even Azzali will be there, remember him? I have for him the gratitude owed to a Magister, to the one opening for you the book of life, as De Amicis put it. Then there will be Scorza, a film producer. A kind of yo-yo oscilating between the billion and bankruptcy. And Anna! Anna dear! Anna and Carla have had the same lover for ten years. Now that his dead, they love each other like two widows. Like relatives. Then there 'll be the ball, at first slow and melancholic. Mrs Taylor loves slow rhythms. An energetic, mean, Australian, called the "richest, meanest". Only generous with youngmen. They'll then dance frantically, always quicker. They'll be in a hurry to have fun, years gvo by. Let's have fun while we can! Until the usual funny guy will jump into the pool. Everyone will think of him as funny! Let's go! This is a party! Their party! They need to have fun, to forget! - What time is it? - Almost 5. - You'll clean tomorrow morning. - Thank you, ma'am. Good night. Don't wake me up under any circumstance. I'm dead... Cesarina, as soon as I'll get up, I want to take a bath. - Have you called the plumber? - Yes. - Let's hope he's not a bungler. - He's my fiancee. I'll take it. Hello? I'm sorry for my English, but I'm tired. - I didn't quite get it. - Yesterday, in your house, dollars have disappeared. I'm terribly sorry! Are you sure? Yes, when I took my handbag to pay, I noticed the dollars were gone. You did well to call me, it's a very annoying thing. I'll make enquiries. I gave the handbag to the maid, and she gave it back to me. O yes, Cesarina, is new. She was at the wardrobe. My girl, I've been an inspector for 20 years, I'll give you an advice. - Tell the truth, maybe I'll be able to help you. - I don't need any help! I haven't stolen anything! I've watched the handbags all evening. But they were always calling for me, for a glass of water, for th e bathroom. Maybe I was careless, but I didn't steal anything! If it wasn't you, who else? You're new here, the other employee have been here for years. - What does it mean? - It means I have complete trust in them! Never again has such a thing happened in my house! Money disappearing from handbags, in my house! What a shame! - But madame... - I know you, today's servants... First you order, than beg. Inspector, that's enough. I've reported it, now it's up to you. Then? Only you had access to the handbags. What's the matter? Let's go! Cesarina? Cesarina of all people? Yes! It annoys me a lot, what a thing! If I'm sure? It can only be her! But I know her well, she wouldn't... - I know my servants also. - I understand... - But there were so many people yesterday. - Do you think it was one of us? Anyway, the lnspector will see to that, I only wanted to let you know. Yes, forgive me... I... couldn't imagine. Once again, forgive me. Get my bath ready right away. - Surprised? - Quite, come. Now you'll explain me why you've disappeared. Give me a light. If I tell you it was because of a maid, you won't believe me - Because of Cesarina? - Yes. It seems impossible, but there's no doubt anymore. I don't understand what has Cesarina to do with us. It's true, what could have Cesarina to do with us. Now it seems absurd even to me. When the necklace disappeared, Henry was sure it was her. But I wasn't, I cared for her and I thought she cared for me, after those 5 ayears in London, among strangers, far away from home. I didn't want her to be reported, and I found her a job. But today I found out that she even stole from mrs. Bellaris. It still seems absurd, I don't know if l should report her for the necklace or not. - Yes, but still haven't told me... - I didn't think it was her. I had taken her as a child, from the country... and I doubted you. - Liliana! - Now I'm ashame. Nobody else than you had been in my room, you needed money... .. and you hadn't dared ask me for it. - Liliana... - I want you to know... .. that if I thought that, I couldn't make myself hate you. Can I ask you a favor? Let's not talk about it! - No! - Come on, don't be foolish! Tell the truth, where did you put the money? If you admit it, we'll send you home, if you don't, trouble's coming! You'll get in the courthouse! - You'll go in prison, with thieves and assassins! - No! Your name will be in the papers. I don't want it! Then say you have stolen, and where you've put those dollars. I haven't stolen, I swear it! I swear it on my mother! Why don't you want to believe me? A match! Will you make up your mind? It's for your own good. - I've told you, I'm no thief. - Where were you before? - At the Rogers. - And then? The master didn't like me. He's English, but madame loved me. - Where do they live? - In Archimede st. - I'll call them from my office. - But speak to madame, please! I'm sure she'll help me. Pass me the Rogers residence, Archimede st. Hello? Yes, Rogers residence. Inspector? Madame is not at home. You can tell me, I'm her husband. - Yes, Cesarina. - She was a maid in your place. - Why did she leave service? - Why are you asking? There was a theft in the house she was working in and it'd seem... It's my duty to tell you that we've sent her away for something similar. By charity, my wife didn't report her I understand, thank you. You should have told the truth, you have stolen from the Rogers also! What have you to say now? - Did madame say that? - What did you expect? I don't believe she said it! Nobody's believing you now! - Will you tell the truth? - I didn't do anything! - You'll tell it to the judge in prison. - No! I didn't do anything! I don't want to go in prison! No! - What shall we do? - I don't know, she's not confessing. - We'll have to let her go. - We must frighten her. - Did you hear her scream? - But she stole. - But we've got no evidence. - It's known servants steal. Inspector, come! Make room! A blanket! What has she done! What have you done? You shouldn't have done it! Why didn't you call me? I'd have helped you. Look at me. I didn't abandon you, I thought... I know it wasn't you. Everyone will know it, I swear it. Look at me, darling. Don't you recognize me? Lulla, what are you doing here? What's the matter? You're frightening me! Why are you crying? What's the matter with you? It's not my fault, how could I know she'd do such a thing? - I couldn't have known! - What are you talking about? I don't understand. I'm the one that stole. What do you mean? I took the money from that handbag. I needed it, I didn't know what else to do. It was you! And you didn't say anything, you let her die like this. And you were the thief! It's not my fault! The money wasn't for me. I had to give it to Osvaldo. He had found out that Guido was my lover. No one of you knew it, and he threatened me. He'd have told everything had I not paid, and always wanted more! He's to blame for everything! I couldn't know she'd kill herself! - You were coming to see me? - Yes. - Let's go out together then. - Wait. - What's the matter? - Hl met with Lulla Possenti. - We talked. - About me? - Yes, also. So? She stole from the Bellaris. - Lulla? - To give the money to you. - To me? - Because you were blackmailing her. - Has she gone mad? - She isn't mad, and you know it. - As you know you've stolen from me. - l? What are you talking about? Yes, you. - Don't pretend. - You're mad. - Stop! - Shut up! No, I want to shout the truth! That Cesarina had nothing to do with it, and I want you to tell it to everybody! It's not my fault if that servant killed herself! - And then, if I fall, you all fall. - I don't care! You want a scandal? For what, imbecile?! She'll still be dead! You want it burried like this? That's what you want to do? Of course, exactly that! - Let's not talk about it. - Then I'll talk. And the others will. It's not true, lnspector, I haven't said anything of the kind. Lulla, chow can you deny it? You confessed it to me! - You. - l? Liliana, what are you talking about? Why do you go on lying? Because of you a guiltless woman died. You can't go on lying. Aren't you afraid? Enough! I want to get out of here! Just a few more questions. You can't keep me here. I'm the wife of lawyer Possenti. If you want, I can call him. - I doesn't matter. - What else is there? Let's end it! - There's an accusation we have. - How can you suspect a lady? - Has anyone netered your wardrobe? - I don't wish to answer. Honorable people come in to my house. - Madame doesn't think this way. - It's because the girl died. - Why should I have stolen? - There'd be a reason. - To keep this gentleman silent. - And why? Even here there's a reason, do you want to hear it? - I'm not interested. - I understand. - What do you do? - l? - Yes, how do you make a living? - From my house, and from her. - I don't admit that... - Keep calm. - So? - I write for newspapers. - And you bought a car? - I've only paid one installment. - And the hotel? - I'm two weeks behind. Don't doubt my respectability, my work is clean. Getting paid to compromise a woman? He asked me to introduce him to a friend... .. so he could give her husband a reason to divorce. - Stop making up things! - You told me! - 'cause you were jealous! It's not true! His capable of this, and more! Don't believe him. Alright, we'll see if it's true! Everything's ridiculous, it's an abuse! I have the right to interrogate you. and you the duty to answer. Yes, but you're insulting honorable people here. - Who'd this people be? - Me and my wife. You offend us with your vulgar suspicions. It's not my fault if this thing gets dirtier and dirtier. - You don't know this gentleman. - Yes, I do know him. - How did you come to meet him? - She introduced us. - Never been at Lince agency? - Once. - What for? - Here it is... - I went... - Let him speak. He wanted pictures from a certain reception. Lot of people do. - And wasn't he also there? - No, no. - And he didn't come another time? - No, I didn't see him afterward. What the hell would l be doing at Lince? - Why should I leave my wife? - Why? - Do you know commendatore Azzali? - I don't know them. O no? And still, you pay their hotel and dressmaker expenses. What do you care? I don't have to explain myself to you! What gives you the right to meddle with my private life? This has nothing to do with that servant's death! Yes, I know, maybe she died also because of this. You can all go, but I want you all to wait there. As you've heard, your accusations can't be confirmed. Because everyone has his own dirt to hide. They're all afraid. But I can prove there was a theft in my house! - What? - A diamond necklace And how did he steal it? The day before it was discovered stolen, he was in my room, he's the only who could have done it. Why didn't you report him then? I didn't wish to. I was afraid that during the investigation, my husband will find out the truth. - And that's why Cesarina died. - I understand. I can't accuse someone on mere suspicions, your accusations are unsubstantiated. - We don't know if the theft took place. - I'm telling you! It's not enough, you haven't reported it. Call my husband, will his word be enough? - Yes, but he'll find out... - Call him. As you wish. - Think about it... - Even you're afraid? Afraid it becomes known that girl died innocent? I want to go all the way! - The journalists are here, what should l tell them? - Nothing, who called them? No one, they can smell the stinch. - What's the matter? - Excuse us, but madame... Let me say it. I must hurt you, I'm sorry. But I don't think I can lie anymore. The moment for telling the truth has come. Osvaldo's not my cousin. - Is this the place to speak about it? - If it is. Even if it's too late. Had I talked about it when I should have, Cesarina wouldn't be dead now. He stole the necklace. - What are you saying! - Yes. I had him in my roomo, the day before. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Silence. I let you suspect her. I was afraid an inquiry would bring up the truth, and a scandal would follow. The gossip of the people we know, the newspapers... Forgive me. You're an honest man and will understand I can't lie anymore. - Want to sign it? - What is it? The report of the theft? - What theft? - Of the necklace! - No necklace has disappeared. - Henry! But you told me the girl was sent away for theft! It was about some petty sum, I'd have reported her for the necklace. - But madame... - She's shaken by the suicide. - She needs treatment, forgive her. - I understand. - But the necklace? - No necklace has disappeared. I've got nothing to report, lay it off. Even you, like the others. - You don't need me anymore? - You can go. I'm waiting for you, dear. - Go. - And now? There's nothing to be done. I did want you wanted, and here's the result. Nobody did anything. After all that happned, you're letting him go? You can't, you have to believe me! - It can't end like this. - There's no proof a crime was committed. A theft, a swindle, a death. There was a death, and it was that of an innocent. You're the only one saying this. I can't do anything else, I must let everything sleep. Suspicions and unsubstantiated accuses don't count! If you're right, truth will com eout. Now, please excuse me, but l... Please... Thank you. They can all leave. - Wait. - I'm free, am I not? Yes, but be careful, the inquiry will go on. Now we know, so you'd better behave. don't do anything, you can't believe what she has said. - If she said, she had a reason. - Of course there is. I've dumped her and I'm now with someone I like better. - You know how women are. - Go. Open the window, let's get fresh air. I couldn't do anything else. I can't be mixed up in a trial, not in my position, and admit my wife is a thief's lover. I made the mistake of bringing you back among your friends. I'll ask for a transfer. We'll go away and won't bring this up anymore. They've shot! Take him up! Easy! Go away! Now, you can begin, lnspector.
