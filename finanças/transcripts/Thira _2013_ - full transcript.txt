This is not the first time that We have faced any issues in the past. But then many great people have inspired and motivated us... ...through these rough patches, right? They fought for the right things and fought for justice. Today our own city is becoming unsafe by the minute... ...and crime rates are increasing. Newspapers and TV channels are flooded with crimes against women, murder, rape. This is the time for many people to look up to us and lead us. Where are they indulging in activities that might question the credibility? Just look at Kannada Times senior editor Mr. Pranab Ray's case. He was arrested for the charge of... - I need to meet the Minister. - Do you have an appointment? Tell him that it is Rohini Pranab. That is my appointment. At night 12 o'clock, in a deserted place A dark bungalow In which many girls were imprisoned. Rohini Maayi hid her car in the dark street and sneaked towards the bungalow. - There was weapon in Maayi's hand. - Weapon! - Was it a knife? - No, it must have been a gun. Do you know what Maayi did after that? Maayi moved silently towards the bus. - Which bus? - The same bus In which villains were going to take the girls far away from here. - Then what happened? - Then... Then Maayi broke open the tank of the bus with her weapon. - After that? - After that... - Bhoom... - Bomb? - What about Maayi? - She ran away faster than PT Usha ...and broke open the back door of the bungalow ...and saved all the girls. Angel! Can Maayi do all this? Rohini Maayi can do anything. Am I getting suspicious for nothing? Is that what you are telling me? Look at this. Pranab's phone that got released from custody is as clean as new. No messages, no call history. Nothing. Its wiped out. Who did this and for what? The same day when Pranab was arrested... ...people ambushed our house and Pranab's office cabin. When I informed the police, there was no enquiry conducted. Whom are they protecting? Some truths feared by others was in Pranab's hold. Though Pranab was a heart patient, he was not given medicine in jail. When he had cardiac arrest he was not admitted in the right time in hospital. Treatment was delayed. All that was part of their plan. Alex, my husband didn't die of a cardiac arrest. It was a well executed murder. Tomorrow morning mother will come. She'll get annoyed of my shortened hair. Mother wants me to keep my hair plaited. It is 5 years since I met her. Your suffering days are over, Nithya! From tomorrow onwards you'll start a new life. Rohini, again and again you are beating around the same bush. I also saw the CCTV footages. The inspector who arrested Pranab from that hotel room with that minor girl,... ...I have spoken to him directly. They say that they had solid evidence for the Paedophilia charge. Pranab loved children more than God. Even if others quote it in a different angle,... ...I know that it is not true. Police report says that Pranab was drunk during arrest. Pranab never drinks, Alex! And you know that as well. So now you want me to reopen the case and find out who framed him? Come, Rohini! The case is closed. And the man is...no more. They have dropped all the charges. Do you mean to say that Pranab's blemish would be gone with that? 25 years of journalism. His struggle for truth and goodness... And at the end of all this... What do people call him? A Paedophile! No, that is not right. He deserves a better goodbye. I'll find the people behind this. - Whether I get help or not. - Rohini, one second! I understand what you are going through. The death of Pranab is a big loss. But again and again moving towards losses... Why are you like this? What did you achieve from your years of struggle? What did Pranab achieve? See, you are a cardiac surgeon. You have got a good reputation too. - You deserve a better life. - Everyone deserves a better life, Alex! There is no use of leading a life without concern and affection.. ...for people around us. Why do you always keep digging up the dirt? I haven't changed, Alex! I'm still the old Rohini that you know. So the question is not why I'm doing this. But the question is how could I not do. Basu! Maayi, I had been trying to get you from a long time. - What happened? - A while ago I had gone to Parsi Complex. To supply computers to Xavier Exports. As soon as I went inside, below the staircase I heard three people talking. I couldn't listen properly. But they were talking against you. - Against me? - Yes, Maayi! After that they were talking about a party. Then...they said something about a packet. What packet? Which packet? I couldn't hear anything clearly. Who were they? One was a bearded fellow. Must be around 30 years old. The 2nd one looked like an executive. Company ID, File in hand. - What about the 3rd one? - You also know him. ACP Shikhawat. He only arrested Pranabda. Maayi... I feel scared. I feel that something wrong is going to take place. Take care of yourself. - Madam! - What happened? Sunil, what happened? Teresa Amma! People came with masks on face. In a big vehicle they took away our children... They took away all of them, Rohini! Angel... Rohini, I heard. Who did this? Rohini, let me see if I can do anything. Dada, please don't reveal this to anyone. If police and media comes to know about this,... ...they'll spread rumours saying that I sold my children. Within minutes they'll do this. They are orphan children who have suffered lot of torture in life. I chose this life to protect them. Today they have entered Arpana... ...and took away my sleeping children. How dare they! Wherever they hide them I'll find my children. I'll get them back without even a single scratch. If I have to behead anybody for that,... ...I'm ready Dada! I'm ready! "This is extending nonstop. This is climbing without ending." "Why do you cross many miles?" "Why do you immerse in the depth all that collect in the muddy sand?" "Who are you keenly shrouding everything within sight?" "Who are you covering with speed the feet coming to you?" "Is this laughter or funeral pyre?" "Is it your destiny or my illusion?" "Who are you keenly shrouding everything within sight?" "Who are you covering with speed the feet coming to you?" Okay. Did you take these two years back? You look the same. - Is that your sister? - Yah! She is so cute... What does she do? Studies? She is now studying in 7th semester. I like her with her long hair and all. Hey, wait! Is that your father? You resemble your father. Do you have issues with father? I'm sorry! It's none of my business. On seeing your face I felt so. It's a common issue faced by many people while studying in college. I didn't study. I was truant. Father lost temper and I left the house. Oh... Now I'm going to see sister. I must accompany with her to the house. I must meet father and mother. It is 1-2 years since I met them. So you have decided to compromise, right? What compromise! 2 years of my life without seeing them was a big compromise. I walked out impulsively in anger. It is easy to walk out. I had lot of friends to help. That time I didn't understand that they won't be there forever. - Now did you understand? - Very well. Then father's age. Mother's health. At one point of time we have to think about all this. They may whack me or get angry with me. - That is okay. - Hey! They mustn't whack. I would walk out the moment my parents whack me. Sister, there is no problem in getting whacked one in a while. Father is a father. - Okay. Good night! - Good night! You know... I find it very interesting. How could you talk so openly with a stranger like me? I feel uneasy to talk to close ones. With stranger we can say anything. - Okay, good night! - Good night! Shopping...I don't have a single penny with me. I'll get it. Stingy! Do you have any problem in accompanying me? Not that. But I'm sure to get bored. Then we'll do one thing. We'll take that Payal also with us. That is good. That will be better for both of us. Hey...she is committed. You bring her. I'll take care of the rest. Doctor, how did you get this note? Today morning I got it from Arpana's dormitory. May be in last night's struggle it must have slipped from their hand. Is there anything else other than the name of the drug? Nothing, Arjun. It is torn from the prescription of some doctor. I'm sure. Okay, just hold on. Hello, doctor! Are you sure that Brundanga? - Yes. - Okay, let me check. Doctor, Brundanga is Scopolamine. One of the most dangerous drugs in the world. Arjun, I want to know where they get it? And who deals in this? I'll call you back. Tresemma, do you know what this is? A dangerous drug that is used in Latin America. Once it enters our body, it'll make us lose our memory. After that nothing will get registered in mind. Each and every girl will turn as a slave, who'll do anything for anyone. Once they come out of the effects of the drug... ...only the pain and bruises in the body will be left. Without knowing what really happened,... ...without even able to recollect the faces of those who raped them ghastly ...they'll pass through mental trauma. What else is needed to shatter a girl's life? Arjun! Doctor, Khatri drugs and chemists, Picket street. What? But Renu we had scheduled Ammu's surgery for next week. That girl's condition is very bad. Grandparents call had come. They are on the way to the hospital now. Renu, I'm in a very difficult situation right now. Can you please find me a replacement? Dr. Ravindran might be available. Please tell him that it is an emergency and call me back. Somebody has bought this drug from you. I want to know who. This is not with us. Sorry! You are having it here and you're selling it as well. Tell me who bought it. How many times do I need to tell you? Madam, I don't know anything about this. - You go away from here, please! - One phone call. And in 5 minutes this place will be surrounded by police. I'll put you inside jail. Do you know how long you'll stay in jail for illegal possessing of drugs? Ma'am, I know nothing about this. I don't handle all this. I just work here. I don't have any time for this bullshit. Tell me who bought it. Or else I'll just destroy your life. - This will not work out. - Shall I call the police? Dr. Rohini! Ma'am, I'll lose my job. Please, Ma'am! You leave. Kaleram...Dr. Kaleram! This is his handwriting. Yes, doctor! What can we do for you? I was looking for this. We don't sell this kind of drugs. We are strictly legal. That's what he told me. - Renu! - Doctor, I'm really sorry! Ravindran doctor is not available. He is attending one emergency case. - Has Ammu reached the hospital? - Not till now. But you have to come in now. Doctor...Doctor. I'll be there. Basu, you need to find a man. Dr. Kaleram. Sir, I have checked everything. Inbox, drafts and sent items. ND I'm sure, sir! Pranab's phone had nothing suspicious. - What about Rohini? - No, sir! File is not there with her. You don't know her. She'll find it out. We are waiting for that, sir! Leave all that, sir! - Did you read the newspaper? - Yes. It's good work. But it shouldn't stop with print media. From TV and internet to every nook and corner of the city... ...allegations against Rohini must reach. It'll be done, sir! She has caused huge loss for us. From many years. She has to pay for every bit of it. Idli, vada, coffee. What is this Chotu? You took so much time. Sir...That... Leave that. What happened to the vehicle? There mustn't be any delay. Just a second. I'll call you back. - Deepak! - Yes, sir! We need one more in the packet. For the party. Excuse me! I want to get down in Kore Gali. Do I need to attend to you immediately because you are talking in English? Hello! Ticket please... I think he got annoyed the minute I asked in English. You ask in Kannada. - Naan Kore Gali Nalli Ille Beku. - What? - Naan Kore Gali Nalli Ille Beku. - Naan Kore Gali Nalli Ille Beku. Sir, Naan Kore Gali Nalli Ille Beku. You have missed to get down. He said as Oyidhu and got annoyed. That means you have missed to get down. Alight somewhere there. Naan Illi Beku, Bus nillisae. Sir! Sir, Naan Illi Beku, Bus nillisae. Sir, bus nillisae. Bus nillisae. Stop man! Get down fast. Don't wait for bus. You take an auto and come. Hello! I have reached Electronic market. Have you reached? I'll come soon. Come soon. I'm standing in the junction. What are you wearing? Sleeveless? - What is wrong with sleeveless? - You shouldn't wear sleeveless. Okay. I'll call after one hour. One minute. I can't work for the old payment. This time I want 30. I see. You don't mind to see Payal in mini skirt. I'm not supposed to wear even sleeveless, right? 30,000/- Are you mad? The work is done by me. I'm taking the risk. I must get money for that. You are my sister. She is also somebody's sister. - I never felt so. - Do you think I'm minting money? I work for marginal profit. - Twenty thousand is final. - Can't do it. You need not laugh. You cover with that shawl. Is it a blanket to cover with? There is a style to wear this. I just don't like that style. Twenty five thousand is final. Okay...okay. Come. Brother... Ria...Ria... Rohini, did you see today's newspaper? The news about you in that is spoiling the reputation of this hospital. In women's trafficking case... ...they suspect that your NGO is also involved. I know that these allegations are fake. But people will unnecessarily gossip, right? That will spoil the credibility of this hospital. I'm so fed up. I'm so worried about the whole thing. It's your hospital. I can understand you getting worried about the reputation. But do you know what is worrying me right now? I girl of 10 year old is waiting for me in the operation theatre. I have a job to do. I'm Nithya's mother. My daughter... Doctor, its urgent. You have to come now. - Greetings! - Greetings! - Greetings! - Greetings! What is the name? Reduce the sound. They don't do any work. - What is the name? - Lakshmi. - Gone to hospital? - Yes, sir! 'They raided and saved the kids orphanage.' 'And the revelations were shocking and alarming.' 'The police found kids in dire conditions from physical torture.' 'And many of them were sexually abused.' You said correctly. 'At the time the police didn't realize...' 'they were going to uncover a Pandora's box.' We can't give you any names right now. Investigation is still going on. Sir, we heard that Dr, Rohini Pranab Arpana is involved. I said no names. If anybody is found guilty they'll be arrested and the NGO will be shut down. - Go. - Sir... Please... Speak up! Whose mistake is it? - Whose mistake is that? - Sir... Why did you go that way alone at mid night? If you go alone at night, what will men do? - No! - The mistake is yours. And you have come to lodge a complaint. What did the four men do? Tell... what did they do? Sir, I have told the lady police officer everything. I'm the police officer here. If you want to lodge an FIR, you must tell everything to me. Then what happened? Where did they catch hold of you? How many times they assaulted you? I want the whole detail. Tell me. Speak up! Dirty wretched woman! How did you become a police officer when you don't know how to talk to women? - Who are you? - Stop! - Why are you screaming? - Come... You talk in Kannada. You Madrasi! Leave me... leave... Ask these questions to the culprits who tortured this poor lady. Throw that rascal out! If you create commotion in police station,... ...will anyone accept your complaint? Do you want me to remain silent hearing what he was talking? Somebody kidnapped my sister in the morning at Kore Galli. Do one thing. There is a special wing here called as... ...Women's protection and Anti-human trafficking. It is they who look into missing case and trafficking case. I'll give you the address. I have brought the criminals, sir! Who? The prostitutes who were arrested two days back. They are not criminals. They are victims. He is a police who doesn't know the difference between victims and criminals. - After finishing this I'll come. Go. - Okay, sir! Do you know why I'm drinking sitting here while duty time? I'm unable to sit inside. It is suffocating. So many case files are lying. Trafficking, kidnapping, missing. It is 6 months since I came to this station. Till now I couldn't save even a single girl. How is that possible? There is no task force or bullets. If we ask money to fill petrol for police vehicle, they say that there is no fund. Then they have appointed such fools as constables. They are asking whether trafficking wing means traffic police. With such people's assistance I can't even work in petty shops. - Such a wing to dodge people. - Sir, my sister... In your sister's case there are 3 possibilities. Rape, ransom kidnapping, trafficking. I feel that this is trafficking. In that case they won't keep her in local for long. It is risky for them to kidnap here and supply here itself. Within 24 hours they'll smuggle her to some other state. You have got only 24 hours. You must find her before that. - Else it is difficult. - Sir, I... What can I do? How can I... I feel sorry for you. But I'm not in a position to help you. - Hey, bring that omelet. - I'm getting. Son, have you reached there? I can't get Ria on phone. What is the commotion there? - Are you doing shopping? - Yah! Okay, I'll call later on. Have you changed your decision? Won't you come back? I know why you are silent. You need not think and worry about anything. This time when you come all your problems with father will end. Naveen, won't you come? Tell me. Naveen... I'll come. I'll come surely with Ria. Brother... Ria...Ria... Brother, did you see any accident here today? I didn't see anything? - Was there an accident here today? - I don't know. Was there an accident here today? Was there an accident here today? - Black colour jeep... - I don't know. - Brother... - Meals is not ready. You wait. It is not that. Wasn't there an accident at the junction? Black colour jeep... I don't know Hindi. Which state are you from? Kerala. Hey boy! He is from your place. He is asking about an accident. Listen to him. What is the problem, sir? An accident took place in the junction today, right? - Yes. - Did you see who was in that vehicle? - No, sir! - Cooling paper was pasted. - Did you see the vehicle number? - No, sir! Those scoundrels hit the vehicle and went away without even stopping for a minute. - What was in the jeep? - My sister. - MTL taxi. Go and find their taxi driver. - What did you do this? He saw who was in the jeep. You damaged my car. He was very frightened. He knows them. Go and find them. go. Sir, there was an accident today morning in Kori Galli, right? - I don't know anything. - Sir, I want some details. Please. - Help me, please! - You go away. Please, sir! My sister was there in that jeep. Please! I don't know who they were. I had gone to Patil Gali 3 days back with my brother. They were fighting between themselves. They were beating everyone. My brother was also standing just like that. They whacked my brother also without any reason. Now he is in ICU. I'm a family man. Please don't drag me in these issues. I don't want to meet these men again. You go to Malabar bakery. The fight happened there in the Patil Gali. Really hard blows! I was watching the fight and I also got injured in the neck. From two days I couldn't go for work. All those who took the blows are in serious condition. I heard that one of them died. A nasty team! In native even the party people won't take them for rally. Do you remember anything about them? Name or their place... Anything by which they can be identified. How do we get time for observation amidst getting beaten up? I saw one more guy. He didn't get down from the jeep. Dr, Kaleram. That is what his name is. When my friend was conceived... Not friend but his girlfriend... A Nepali girl who came to work in this saloon. Ultimately when he knew about her pregnancy, he got rid of her. That time only this doctor did all the arrangements. Do you know what people call him in Shastri Nagar? - Abortion doctor. - Brother... Dude, customer has come in bakery. I must go. - She is safe. Perfectly alright. - Thank you so much, doctor! Thank you! - Madam! - Okay, I'm in a hurry. Doctor! Today morning an incident took place in Kore Galli. We met with an accident on the way. We were lucky that we got saved. But I saw a girl in the vehicle witch hit us. A tape was stuck on her mouth. Did you inform the police? As we were in a hurry to reach the hospital we... How many people were there in the vehicle? 3-4 people. One of the guys had a short hair and a short beard. - There was tattoo on his hand. - Do you remember anything else? Okay. I'll see what I can do. Hello! Rohini, in the last 5-6 months for human trafficking... ...only one inspector in this city has arrested culprits. Inspector Sathyajit. I'm on my way to meet him. Dada, whatever information you get, you call me. Five years back when I lost her my daughter was only this much. From the time your phone call came I had been thinking. Whether my daughter would have become fat, lean or tall. When I reached here I heard people talking. Some articles have appeared in newspapers. I don't even know what I should believe. Give me back my daughter. She didn't like long hair. She'll always tell me to cut her hair short. I shortened it for her. You needn't have cut it so short. I broke my promise. Give me one more chance. I'll return back your daughter to you. Doctor will come soon. You wait. Hello! Tell me darling! Why are you getting heated up? I'll take you to the movie in the evening. Brother, how is that abortion doctor? Does he do a good job? Will there be any complication? - Did you inform your parents? - Hello! - Did you inform your parents? - Hey, what is your problem? You mind your business. Hey, you wait! Hey...wait outside. I'll call you they enter just like that. Three days back in Patil Galli a fight took place. You were also there with other guys. - Who were they? - Babu Lal! Babu Lal! Tell me who they are. They took my sister. Tell me who they are. - I don't know. - I can do this all day. I don't know who they are. I'm telling the truth. I don't know their name, address or anything. For me they are people in the dark. When they have work for me they come to me. And they take me to different places. I test the girls whom they kidnap. I don't know anything else. - No names and no numbers. - Did they take you today? Did you see her today? Where? Inform your parents. Water... Don't do anything, sir... I'm having fever. Don't be afraid. I'm not one among them. I have come here in search of my sister. Did they bring anyone else here today? I was brought here only yesterday or day before yesterday. Today I heard girls crying upstairs. I don't know whether it is evening or afternoon. While staying here we can't make out all that. - Before this where were you? - I don't know the place. Before getting into the vehicle our eyes are blindfolded. But it is nearby. It'll be only 10 minutes from here. That place is like a jail. Only one time light came from a window. I saw red colour flowers. But they closed that window also. Then it was full of darkness. Now and then devotional songs can be heard from far away. But no God came to our rescue. - Please save both of us. - Two of you? Keep this. Go to bus stand or railway station. Reach home somehow. Leave this place quickly. I don't have any house. Come fast. Somebody might come. Run fast. Make it fast. Hello! Are you okay? Are you asthmatic? Inhaler is in the pocket. Don't be afraid. Close your eyes and relax. Lean forward and take slow deep breaths. Trust me. I'm a doctor. I know you. I have read about you. You couldn't have ready anything good. When my sister was sent here for studies... ...we heard only good things about this city. If what we read and heard were true, I won't have seen my sister being kidnapped in broad day light. - When did this happen? - Today morning. - Where? - In Electronic market. - Kori Galli? - Yes. Its the same people who have kidnapped your sister and the children in my shelter home. That's why both of us are here. As each minute passes by, the chances of rescuing them is diminishing. We have to get out of this place. You tear away that tape. It is not that strong. You can do it. Try... Try harder. Check his pockets. His men might be outside. Physically we can't handle them. If you are cornered, push them against hard surfaces and hit them where it hurts. Are you really a doctor? He shouldn't follow us hereafter. Hello! - Rohini! - Dada... I'm in Ganachari Gali. We must meet now itself. Don't be afraid. He is one of us. I met inspector Sathyajit. When he came to know that I'm from the department, initially his wife didn't allow me to meet him. Later on when I told your name... He knew you very well. Two weeks back we raided a brothel. We saved 14 girls and arrested 3 traffickers. I wanted to get rid of human trafficking forever from my city. But everything went waste. Scoundrel! The minute I reached police station the phone started to ring. And all the traffickers got released. My FIR got torn without even reading it. My superior officer ACP Shikhawat... If anybody is found guilty, they'll be arrested. Sathyajit followed them to find out the connection between Shikhawat and them. He scrutinized some truths. Lots of truth that was hard to believe. The depth of trafficking network... Big connections above Shikhawat. The localized human trafficking operations. It was gaining an organized crime network structure. Under an invisible central puppet master. World's biggest crime network that was growing without any limits. That man understood all the facts. I was collecting evidences against all these animals. But I was not alone. There was one more man behind them. That man surprised me. He was going to start his own fight against human trafficking. Pranab Ray. Why Pranab was annihilated? Why my children were abducted? Why allegations were raised against my Shelter home? Now everything is clear. Pranab was against traffickers. But why didn't he tell me even a single word? - Rohini... - These are some photographs. I took them when I was following Shikhawat and his friends. In memory card also same images are there. This might help you. I swear no girl came. From two days business is very dull. Hello Maayi! Are you okay? Basu, some suspects are there. I'm sending the photos. See if you can recognize them. I'm coming there. Rohini, the three traffickers who were arrested by Sathyajit, I'm standing in front of the house of the first trafficker. - I didn't get anything from here. - Okay. What about the other two? - I'm enquiring. - We don't have time, Dada! Please do it fast. Ravi, Salma get up. There is urgent work. - Did you get any news about Maayi? - She is fine. She'll be here soon. Take out the photos from the phone. Fast... Rascal! He only arrested Pranabda. I saw him. He was the one. Maayi, I have recognized one fellow. He was in Parsi complex yesterday night with Shikhawat. We have to I.D. this guy. Show the other photographs. Stop... Stop... Ravi, zoom here. I have seen this logo somewhere. No, it's not the company. He works for RD Mining Corp. We must find out the connection between ACP and RD Mining Corp. Get every possible information about RD Corp. Images, articles and everything about it. Doctor, I don't understand any of this. You are trying to find the connection between police and some corporate. I must save my sister before she is smuggled out of this city. Naveen, listen to me. They are all linked. I don't know how. If we can find proper connections, we can find out about the kidnappers. Trust me. I have done this before. - And I have brought my girls back. - Maayi...see here. I have read about this. In-between an enquiry about the mining scam... ...judge had an accident. RD Mining Corp has nothing to do with the accident, ACP Shikhawat. That's the connection. Shikhawat was the saviour of RD Mining Corp. But these people in trafficking... - I don't understand. - Maayi, see this. Thanks to Justice Cherwar for proving us not guilty. Then in that case this should be your celebration time, right sir? Oh yes! We are definitely going to celebrate this moment. There is going to be a huge party. We'll have a grand party, sir! This is a very big success for us. Keep the packets ready. Many big shots are coming. Our girls...Packets... All of this is for the celebration of an ill-mannered corporate. But these people have lots of money. They can make use of celebrities or models. Then why these girls? Rohini! I'm coming from his house. The third trafficker, who was arrested by Sathyajit. When I went through his house I got this. I talked with the house owner. When the whole room was searched... ...there was an ID card in the middle of many things. From that one guy, one of his regular visitor was identified by the house owner. His boss is the manager of Xavier exports company. I'm in meeting. I'll call you. Its a cover up company. They are actually traffickers. If we catch him, we'll get back our children. - Naveen... - Hey! You need not come. You must not be caught one more time. We'll handle this. - But Dada... - Listen to what I say. You must remain here with Rohini. Basu...Ravi...come with me. Tomorrow it'll be 12 days after Pranab's death. Amidst many problems leaving me alone he just left. Naveen...we need to go... Now. He never left me in the dark. Whatever he wished to tell this world and whatever I should know, Pranab handed over everything to me and went. I was late to understand it. The last message that Pranab sent me. Read it. My life is full of experiments. Search to find the truth has lead me to lot of secrets. When you come back you'll have the key to all the story. Do you find anything strange? As if something is hidden between the words. Then some weird grammar mistakes. - Mine life...all the story... - Exactly. Grammatical errors and Pranab... - No...Never. He is a journalist. - Then how this? He deliberately committed these mistakes. As you said, he has hidden something amidst the words. In such a manner that I can only understand. Pranab has got a habit. He'll write most important matters in capital letters. You read and see the words written in capital letters. Is there any news about our children? Mine, Experiments, Search, Truth, Story. Translate all the words. Ente (Mine) Pareekshanangal(Experiments) Anveshanam(Search) Sathyam(Truth) Katha (Story). The story of my experiments with truth. Autobiography of Gandhiji. You turn the photo, Naveen. When you come back you'll have the key to all the stories. The key to all secrets. The key to Pranab's locker. If what inspector Sathyajit said is true... If Pranab has done investigation about human trafficking... All the information that we require will be there in this locker. Let's go. Rohini, did you get any information? A summons has been issued against you. Pray for our girls. When I come back, they'll be with me. - Maayi, I'll also accompany you. - Come. You promised that you would make all the arrangements at the right time. Now you are screwing up at the last minute. Hell with the Siddha Group! Give me their details. Rest I'll talk in personal. You are not fit for any work. Come to Khade Bazaar. Somebody is following me. No, it is urgent. You have to let me through. Please listen, Ma'am! Already there is a customer in the locker room. I can't allow two customers at one time. It's against bank's policies. Please! You have to wait. Brother! Should I get something for you? Tea... biscuits... No. Don't be afraid. God is with you. Otherwise how would you have escaped from that factory? Everything will be fine. You have confidence. Dada, fast... Save our future... Save our future... Save our future...Save our future... Save our future...Save our future... Save our future...Save our future... Naveen I have got all the evidences. I'm coming out now. We'll know where our girls are, in no time. Save our future...Save our future... Save our future...Save our future... Naveen! Leave me Save our future... Save our future... Naveen I have got all the evidences. I'm coming out now. We'll know where our girls are, in no time. Save our future... Save our future... Save our future... Save our future... Naveen! Leave me Save our future... Save our future... Save our future... Save our future... Silent! Make it fast. Hey... move the vehicle... move... Quick! Silent! Maayi... get up. Maayi... come. Maayi... come. Maayi... come. Come, Maayi! You! No, Maayi! Stop! - Come on... come on... fast. - Naveen! Hello, Basu! What did Basu say? Xavier Exports men attacked them. Dada is critical. Sunil...while waiting outside the bank... ...you told me in the car that God is with me. That is why I escaped from that factory. But how did you come to know that they attacked us in the factory? The thing that we both didn't tell, who told you? Stop! Stop... Remaining with us are you spying on us? Where is my sister? I don't know. You know. I know how to make you talk. I don't know anything. They call me and ask me about Maayi. Whatever I know, I tell them. They credit the money for that in my account. - I don't know even their name. - Are you lying? You know everything. - Stop it, Naveen! - Maayi, I don't know anything else. Stop him. Else he'll kill me. Maayi, I don't know anything else. Naveen, please leave him! Are you out of your mind? He has cheated you. - He knows everything. - He doesn't know anything, Naveen! It is I who brought him up from the time he was 7 years old. He won't lie to me, at least not to my face. They give lot of money. I got carried away in greediness. There is nothing in Sunil's phone. Except some calls from the net. I didn't understand that he is in need of money. I didn't protect anyone who loved and stayed by me. Pranab, my children, Sunil, Dada... I let everyone down. Along with that file Holding calls photographs were there. Right from the photograph of the factory where we went...all photos were there. But all the building details... That hard disk... That they... Can we contact the person who handed over that file to your husband? Do you know anything about him? I have only hearsay knowledge. Two weeks back I had gone to Bangalore for a rescue mission. It was at that time that Pranab told me about them. Seems like an interesting guy. One freelance journalist. But like the usual youngsters I don't think he is one who concoct tales for money and fame. I think he really has got something. - The article is about what? - There was no detail discussion. He said that he'll hand over the article tomorrow. I think before disclosing everything... he wanted to make sure whether he could trust me. What did you tell him, Pranab? If there is anything authentic in his hand, I'll support him hundred percent, I said. But next day he didn't come to meet Pranab. - He wasted my time. - What happened? I went there at the time he told me. I even waited for half an hour. He didn't show up. These youngsters, you know... They just don't care. But next day, the day Pranab got arrested, they must have met. They must have exchanged the file. Something has happened amidst this. Somebody knew about the file. Pranab must have also realized... ...that somebody is there behind him for the sake of that file. That is why just before the arrest... ...he has hidden those files in bank locker and sent that message to me. Pranab was afraid that even the phone would be traced. If you saw Holding cells in that photograph, the details about which we are searching should be in your memory. Please, doctor! You have seen those photographs. Please try. There is no other alternative with us. The first one was the factory. The next two photos... Those buildings... That doesn't belong to this city. - Are you sure? - Yes. It is next to some beach. The next photo... that building is also not in this city. It's in Gulbarga. I'm very familiar with the mosque behind it. But there is one more, right? I don't understand where that is... Photo was very compact. An old building. With Bougainville flowers around... I don't remember anything else. I have seen sunlight only once through the window. There were red colour flowers around. Was it pink colour which she intended? Could it be Bougainville flowers? Did that girl say anything else? I don't know the place. Before getting into the vehicle our eyes are blindfolded. But it is nearby. It'll be only 10 minutes from here. Now and then devotional songs can be heard from far away. Songs could have been from some temple. Ten minute from the factory. Temple...old building... It has to be the old town. It is a big area. Our guess need not be correct. But except this we don't have any other information in hand. - Chanting... - Naveen, slow down. Chanting... Go and catch her. During college days, I was beaten more severely than this for ragging. Do you think I'll disclose everything if you whack me? I'm not Kaleram. For each and every blow that I take here your sister will pay for it there. She hasn't been taken to fondle in mattress. She'll be tortured. You... Speak out. He won't talk how much ever you strike him. Check his phone. Naveen, please check his phone. Naveen, catch him. Catch him... Ma'am wait! I saw a message in his phone. "Packet sent through Siddha transport". Then their phone number. Siddha transport! Come... Do you remember their phone number? Then call them now. You keep talking something. Don't let them hang up. He shouldn't be able to get them on phone. Before he reaches there, we must land there. Your subscriber is busy. - What happened, Boss? - Do you think I was celebrating Holi? I don't know Tamil, Boss! Bloody hell! He doesn't even know Malayalam. Go... Interstate going lots of bus, madam! Lots of good drivers also. You tell me, madam! When is your plan? I'll make everything in place. Did you make any interstate trips today? - Excuse me, madam! - Hey, I asked you something. Did you make any interstate trips today? Ma'am! Wait. Let him go. Ma'am, let's go. Hey, where are they going? Stop them. - Where are you running? - Start the vehicle. Fast... We should go back, Naveen! We have to catch hold of him and question him. One sec. Need to hear this, Ma'am! How many times I called you? - What did you tell her? - I didn't tell anything. I don't want any more hassles till the gins reach Vagator. Yes. If any more problem arises, I'll kill you. Sunil's phone. Lots of buses going to interstate, madam! Lots of good drivers also. You tell me, madam! When is your plan? I'll make everything in place. Children have been taken to Vagator. Goa. Vagator is only a transit point. Handlers destination. We have to find out where they are taking the girls from there. - How? - RD Mining Corps success party. Where is that taking place? Who are all attending it? We must find everything. We must trace each and everyone who is going to take part. - How will we do this? - Basu... "The valley covers itself with silence." "The whole world is searched quietly by a mere star." Naveen, take care of her. - And yourself too. - Okay. "It is a search..." "The valley covers itself with silence." In a private bus that too so openly How are they smuggling at broad daylight? Before I rescued my girls, do you know what all they have gone through? Physical torture prolonging for weeks. Without giving time for them to recover from pain... ...repeated mass raping. They will lock up in darkroom those who resist. They will be frightened by leaving snakes in their room. They will be bitten by leech. As long as they resist, the torture will continue. Finally they'll reach a stage where the pain... ...that their body is inflicted with won't affect their mind. With shattered hopes. A stage where anyone can do anything. Totally psychological break down. If they are doped with heavy dosage of sedative while taking away, then they don't even react. Just looks like girls coming home after hectic work. But in public place like this... Won't people feel suspicious? All have got eyes, Naveen! But we don't see that which doesn't affect us. "Eyes are veiled by heavy wind." "Time slips from our hand..." "Far away... in distance... my soul..." "Will this path ever reach and unite you?" "Unite you..." "The valley covers itself with silence." "The whole world is searched quietly by a mere star." Why do you do this? I got into this trouble because I lost my sister. But, you... Since you had the feeling of belonging, you felt the pain when you lost your sister. When each girl gets lost, inside me that pain is there We have reached Panjim. But where will we go from here? - Hello! - Ma'am, I have checked the CDR. Leaving 5 numbers, all the others are in Goa. But they are scattered all over. Vasco... Panjim... Vagator...Bicholim... In many places like that. I'll call you when the next CDR is generated. Give me some more time please! - Ma'am, do we have time? - No. Ma'am, a small development. Those located in Vasco and Bicholim are moving to Panjim. Vagatore numbers... they are also moving to Panjim. - Siolim? - Not moved. Either Panjim or Siolim. What is the information is wrong? What is the party is somewhere else? - Zacharia... - Ma'am, it is not Panjim, it's Siolim. All the numbers given by you are now located in Hill Top Tower. - Each and everyone. - We got it. Where in Siolim? I have come to Goa many times for rescue work. I have my guess. I think I know the place. In the end of each and every Financial year, unethical corporate like this... there will be a column in their account book. Entertainment. It's our girl's life that they are going to write it off today. There is nobody to be seen here. - That's Rohini Pranab, right? - I think so. Ma'am, you move away from here. I'll enquire and come. - What happened? - We are late. After official function they all left from here. They are not staying here. If not here, then where? Do you know who he is? The judge who gave a favourable judgment for RD Mining Corp. Justice Cherwar Hello! I want No.16. And I want her to wear a sari. One year back I have treated a girl who was ghastly raped. It took weeks together for physical recovery alone. Her internal organs were severely damaged. Till now she has not recovered from her mental shock. She was tortured by this monster. In front of girls he is not a human. He is a devil. Yes, I need one more girl. Siddha transport... should be this building. Judge's car. We reached early as our way was diverted. - Naveen, we need to act fast. - What do you want me to do? Have we reached? It is only in this road, sir! Let me see. Naveen...there is fear in your eyes. If they recognize that... If they find out who you are... Then we can't do anything. Hide your fear. Sir, welcome! We were waiting for you. Please come! Sir, please! What are you guys doing inside? You are supposed to receive the guest. - Take him inside. - Sir, please come! Mr. Cherwar! Welcome to our party! You mislead them that you are judge's man. Hello, sir! And you mislead the judge that you are their man. If you hide your fear, you'll become one among them. Hey! Show the parking space to the drive. These guys are powerful. At this time no man will show the courage to enter from outside. That is what your advantage is. That's your weapon too. Ria... "O... star on earth... The light in me..." "My heartbeat increases..." Doctor, my sister is here. - I found her in a room. - Naveen, what about the other girls? - Where are the others? - They are in a room next to this. In the other room. Here only my sister and a small girl are there. Ask if it is Angel. - Angel? - Yes. Tell her that Rohini Maayi has arrived. Tell her not to fear. Don't be afraid. I'm with Maayi. Hey, who are you? Yes, sir! The girls are fine. Just as they had promised. Will they be ready in 5 minutes time? - Justice Cherwar sir is asking. - Yes, sir! They'll be ready in 5 minutes time. Sir, I'm coming down. 5 minutes. - What should I do next? - Leave the rest to me, Naveen! - You just wait. - What's your plan? I'm going to create a diversion. Trust me, Naveen. I have done this before. "O star on earth. The light in me." "This heartbeat will increase inside me, my dear!" "This unending silence will kill me when you are suffering beside me." "My eyes are burning for you to appear in front of me." Sister, don't be afraid. Rohini Maayi will save us. "The time when my heart leaps up and confronts you again." "Even if the unending sorrow is gone away." "Even if the wide shore is fiery." "Even if it is summer heat on the earth." What happened? What is it? What is the matter? What happened? What is it? What did you do? Police will be coming soon. Once they come the crowd will increase. Before that we must move the guests from here. Drivers have gone to have food. They'll arrive soon. Before shifting the VIP's we'll shift the girls. If they find the girls in this condition in such an old building... - Sir, what about the arrangements upstairs? - Shit...shit...shit... Go and wipe everything. Drug the girls and transport them immediately. - Come on fast. move... move... - Our vehicle has been blasted. Get some other vehicle. They are going to shift the girls from here. Let them do it, Naveen! I don't understand your plan. Stay calm. They'll shift the girls from there. But they'll smuggle the girls in the vehicle sent by me. Before their vehicle arrives the vehicle sent by me will arrive. But won't they notice the vehicle driver and all? It is the handlers who arrange all this. These people talk with them. It is not necessary that these people should know the drivers who arrive. Not only that. In such a panic situation they won't take notice of all that. - If they pay attention... - They won't, Naveen! Have faith. Before the girls are alighted in our vehicle is their vehicle comes? We have to take the chance. God will be with us. Move fast... Come on... Move... Go in front. I said fast. Move... move... Alight them quickly. Come on. Make it fast. Leave fast. Make it fast. Harish, you go with them. As soon as you reach, you phone me. Move the vehicle. Fast... Doctor, one of their men is also in the vehicle. That I'll handle. You come out fast. - I'll be waiting for you. - Sir, get in fast. Move... move sir! - Make it fast. Quick. - Get in you, rascal! Clear the car fast. Fast... fast... Go... go. "Our lady of perpetual help..." "You pray for us..." Is it so? Did we get back our children? Doctor, how did you blast that vehicle? I have seen so many Hadthal's (strike) in Kerala. Maayi, I knew that you'll come. "Listen to our grievances..." "Bless us with boon..." "Merge these children with your divine son." Many girls who were on the verge of losing their life... Look at them smiling. That smile should fill their heart and soul. It is not as easy as said. The shock that they have had. The insecurities which they would face. The fear. It'll take a long time for them to recover. They'll look with suspicion each and every stranger. They'll fear each and every foot step. They will get frightened even if they are touched. We must give them the mental strength to heal their wounds. Take care of your sister. I'm very grateful to you... It'll always be there. I really wish I could do something for you. It is enough if you always have that helping heart forever. This world is one crazy bitch, you know. Don't let it change you. Why do you need a mobile if you keep it switched off always? I just called you to enquire about your whereabouts. Your brother won't attend if I call him. You give the phone to him. - Yes, mother! - Naveen... - Father... - Have you started? No, about to start. I'll be there in the station. Bye! 'Helping hearts foundation blast has unearthing trafficking activities.' 'In a shocking incident here at Goa...' '...a large blast was reported near the Helping Heart's foundation.' 'Initial police reports indicated a possible terrorist act.' 'Later it ruled out any such involvement.' 'Interestingly now another story surfaces from the debris of the blast.' 'It is reported that many high profile VIP's were present at the...' '...orphanage at the time of the blast.' 'Allegedly they were receiving special treatments...' '...at a success party hosted by RD Mining Corp.' 'Reports indicate that many trafficked girls...' '...would have been used for the success party.' 'According to eye witnesses these girls were immediately...' '...transported away from the orphanage following the blast.' I don't have house. "Bless us with boons." "Merge these children with your divine son." "Merge them... merge them..." "Children..." Maayi, we shifted all the girls to Aparna." - They are safe now. - Okay, Basu! I'm on the way. Amar... "This is extending nonstop. This is climbing without ending." "Why do you cross many miles?" "Why do you immerse in the depth all that collect in the muddy sand?"
