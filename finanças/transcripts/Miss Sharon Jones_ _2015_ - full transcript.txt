It's like another chapter, you know? Alex: One our major concerns was, "Okay, after the surgery, where does she go?" And then Megan Holken, Sharon's friend, came to the rescue with like, "Well, she can stay with me throughout her recovery." Which I said to her, "Are you sure you know what that means? Like, we're talking six-seven months." And she said, "That's not a problem." Megan Holken: I just put it out there as I would to any one of my friends. And, uh, I wanted her to be in a place where she she could just focus on her. Baby spinach. Raw Vietnamese cinnamon. Flaxseed. Chlorella powder and spirulina. Frozen bananas. Frozen grapes. - (blender whirring) - And I just hope she, uh, keeps focusing on her health, 'cause that's what's really gonna help her get through everything.

It takes skills. It takes skills. This chemo is killing every cell in my body every day, you know? And-and, you know this is tough for me sitting here not doing anything. Yeah, man. I mean, it's gotta be like 19 years, you know, we've been constantly going. Like, look at Dave Guy, you know. He gon' definitely need the work now with the second baby. Everybody needs some money, you know? I-- It's like I'm responsible for everybody's payroll. We gotta get out there. All right. Love you much, too. Talk to you later. Okay. (sighs) All right. This is the African room. Everything you see is from Africa. These are like the dreamcatchers. Some witch doctor put these porcupine spines and little horns from a ram or something. This is my healing room, and nobody bothers me. I mean, this is where I come. - So I'll tell the girls you're here. - Okay. Okay. And they'll come out and get you and draw your labs.

It is true. - That's how I'm handling it. - 'Cause I said the first time-- 'Cause they told me originally, the first time... - Uh-huh. - ...that I had six months to live. - Oh. - But then I says, "Yeah?" I says, "You watch." I've been five years. Now I got it again. I says, "Let me tell you something. I proved you wrong the first time, I'm gonna prove you wrong the second time." Good morning, y'all. Time to do chemo. Oh... (smacking lips) I can taste it. Ahh... Dr. James Leonardo: Sharon has an ampullary cancer, which is related to the bile ducts and the pancreas. She had a very good surgery with a very good surgeon. A Whipple procedure is-- it's a big surgery, where you take the head of the pancreas, part of the small bowel, and some of the bile ducts and, um, you remove them all as a block and then you reconnect everything. Oh, man, my nails is turning dark. The whole inside of my hand is black on the bottom of my foot. Inside my mouth, my tongue. Dr. Leonardo: So she's gonna get chemo therapy for about six months to hopefully eradicate any residual tumor cells that might be around. This is a very... frightening cancer, because if you don't eradicate it completely and it comes back, it's almost impossible to cure. Sharon: I already got jobs booked in February. That scared me, 'cause I'm like, I don't want them to cancel any more gigs because money's getting low. Oh, man, my-- I gotta put my hand in-- I can't do it right now. Hold on. Austen Holman: I think we all know how scary pancreatic cancer is. And, um, we'd have conference calls, and Alex would have to say, you know, "We all need to proceed as if she's going to be fine, but we have to... we have to address the fact that she might not come back." (music playing) Gabe Roth: I remember the first winter here being the hardest winter. There was no heat, and I was working the basement. There's was no windows. There was just like cold air blowing in. And Sharon and I did all the electricity. We actually took this wall out and the kitchen started falling.

Homer Steinweiss: I've been with The Dap-Kings since I was 16. I was just so into old soul music and it was the only band doing it at the time. And then, not just doing it but doing it right. You know, I can really look to her for a lot of what we've built here at Daptone. Every time we go on the road, we play to more people.

She said, "When I grow up, I'm gonna be a writer, I'm gonna be a singer, and I'm gonna buy my mother a house." Sharon: My goal was to get my mother out the projects, and that happened. It was tough, you know, coming up. Six kids, I was the baby. I was the only one that finished high school and I was the first one that went to college. Even as the youngest, I've always been the one that supported my family. I either worked singing with the wedding band and all the way up until now. Just the role I've been doing.

So he taught that parrot to say this. Right there. And this man was so nasty, he used to call us "little niglets" and whatever all the black kids whatever he wanted to call.

There really aren't that many magic tricks. I mean, the idea is the musicians make the music, and we try to get out of their way. We use an 8-track tape machine. And what that does, is it forces us in the studio while we're recording, to make the decisions about how the record's gonna sound. If the trumpets too loud, then the trumpet player has to play quieter. If the hi-hat's too loud, then the drummer has to hit the hi-hat quieter. ♪ Be right there... ♪ But at the end of it, the idea is that when we're done recording, the record's on the tape.

Binky Griptite: So it was, uh, a really rough summer. A lot of changes. My wife and I had just decided to split. And then right after we spilt, the whole tour got cancelled, like, everything just blew up. And so, it's like divorced, laid off, and my friend has cancer. At the time that the band got sidelined, I didn't have enough money to pay rent. I make my money from performing. And so if there's no shows, there's just nothing. And so it was very... very big wake-up call. (groaning) Oh! What is going... What's happening, Sharon? - How you feeling? - I'm... I'm not feeling too good. Gabe: It's rough. I can't imagine what she's going through. It's hard because she wants to move forward, but the way it is in our business, gigs are booked nine months in advance record releases are booked.

Tracy had already said, "Hey, here's how short we are in having enough for the health insurance." To avoid some of this, I did look into business loans and lines of credit for the band. And I don't know. Especially with Sharon's-- I mean, I'm guessing hundreds of thousands of dollars that Sharon probably... I have no idea. I just know what some of the early stuff costs, like the surgery and stuff. Gabe: I just refinanced my house. And, like, the first couple banks rejected me. And apparently they read about Sharon being sick, and, like, rejected the loan because they were like, "Well, how are you gonna make money if she's sick?" And I was like, "Jesus Christ." Sharon will be better than she is-- than she was today. I mean, I thought she sounded remarkable. She's gonna get through this and she'll be back on her feet, man. She's gonna be... like she's...

Sharon: They should have a light switch in here. (Sharon gasps) - Megan: This one was Cornelius. - Was killed by... Megan: By a sleigh. Sharon: I'm-- I'm really thinking about this. Why should you pay somebody every year to keep your body in some dirt in the ground. - Yeah. - To me, that don't make sense. - So what do you want to do? - I think I-- I don't know if my family is gonna freak out 'cause nobody has ever said they wanted to be cremated and ashes spread out. They gonna freak out. Well, what do you care? You're gonna be dead. I'm gonna be dead. What do I care? - I'm gonna get cremated. - I mean, because over that laying with my mother, my father-- my father over here, my mother in this spot. - Why? - Grandparents. Everybody spread around. Nobody goes. It's not like the family gonna go, "Oh, let's go to the gravesite and have a memorial." Get the... You know? Nobody even go back to that gravesite till they maybe at the church one day like, "Sharon's buried here." Why? You could give a little bit to each person in your family. - You could tell them to throw it where-- - There you go, there you go. - The best memory of you was... - That's right. - Go throw some ashes in the pond. - Serious. Sharon: Me, I just got up this morning, you know, and all of my eyebrows are gone. My lashes now are like-- I don't wanna look in the mirror. (phone rings) - Hey, Gabe. What's up? - Hey, Sharon, how you feeling today? Gabe, I got a bald face spot right now. I just hope it grow back. I don't wanna be like Whoopi Goldberg with no eyebrows, man. I don't wanna be bald-faced for the rest of my life. Gabe: You coming down Monday or Tuesday or what? - We'll get there Tuesday. - Okay. - All right, Gabe. - All right, I'll talk to you. All right now. Woman: Can we put the coat back on? - I know you're probably hot. - Sharon: Uh-huh. Put the coat back on and try some scarves with it. - Well... - If this is, yeah. This is a little overflowing. You know who I feel like? Remember Fester in "The Addams Family"? (laughter) Right? All I need now is the black rings around my eyes... (growls) Woman: And that's so pretty. - Sharon Jones. - (phone ringing) - This is cool, too. - Hold on one second. - Hey, Sharon? - Huh? It's Alex and Judy. They want to talk to you really quick. Better be something important to stop me from what I'm doing. Said it better be something important to stop her from trying on jackets. - Judy: Um, "Ellen" for you. - Who? You're gonna do "Ellen." - All right. - You there? - Yeah, I'm still here. - Speechless? - Yeah, that's cool, man. - Did you hear that? I think I don't-- That's-- I don't wanna, like, get too excited. - But, um... - No, get excited. That's like being on "Oprah," man.

We gonna be doing "The Ellen Show." - (cheering) - Woman: Shut the front door. What-what you say? What you think I said to Judy? "Well, could you make sure I dance with Ellen, please? Let her know I wanna dance with her." It's just overwhelming 'cause I know how long you wanted to be on there. - That's all I got to say. - (laughter) Yeah, I know, but we were talking about just going out to dinner together. My mother-in-law, she was gonna pick me up and then we're driving up in her car. Gabe: We're-- we're doing it in California, is that the plan? I second that motion. Sharon: Okay, let's go. Y'all having fun without me and I don't like it. - (laughter) - Ain't we gonna eat? Why would they-- I will kick his ass about right now not having eaten all damn day long. I'm gonna call Alex and curse his ass out. Austen, let's go. Fuck these Dap-fucking-Kings right now. - What? What's going on? - Because dinner cancelled and I'm pissed. - Let's go. - We'll go get dinner. - We'll go get dinner. - It's not the same. (chatter) To celebrate "Ellen." We're gonna go in L.A. We're postponing it for L.A. It's not the fucking same. Let's go. I'm ready to go now 'cause I'm pissed. Don't be pissed. We'll get some... - we'll get some, uh... - It's not the same. The guys is not eating. I'm not with them. We're not hanging out. We're not eating. We haven't had a dinner and hung out in a while. Before the holidays. Before Thanksgiving. We could've had a fucking dinner-- our Thanksgiving dinner-- We're not gonna see each other for Thanksgiving, that's for the parade. (whining) Wave to the people. And then everybody gonna go home and eat dinner with their family. Y'all the only family I got. I thought we were gonna have a family dinner tonight, - and it's been cancelled. - Man: Call Ellen. - God! - Let's go eat dinner. - Let's go eat steak, Sharon. - Man! We'll go to dinner. I've got to go eat dinner. We gotta eat dinner anyway. Alex, how dare you stop dinner for us. This was our dinner. I thought it was gonna be like our Thanksgiving dinner. - He didn't stop it. - Who stopped it? - The guys didn't wanna do it. - No "guys." Only one guy. That was Dave Guy. Fucking... I'm not mad. I'm all right now. It's over with. It's over with. I had to say what I had to say. I'm done! I'm done. - Happy Thanksgiving! - (music playing) Happy holidays! ♪ When I was a child, I used to wonder ♪ ♪ How Santa put my toys under the tree ♪ ♪ I said, "Mama, can you tell me how this can be ♪ ♪ When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?" ♪ - ♪ Ain't no chimneys in the projects ♪ - ♪ In the ghetto ♪ - ♪ Not in the projects ♪ - ♪ Ain't no chimneys in the projects ♪ Look at this. I wish my mother could've seen this. It's like, all these years, me and Dap-Kings, you know, the hardship that we go through... I-I mean-- In church, we used to sing this song. I mean, um, Sister Bullock, and she used to always sing this song. ♪ May the works I've done speak for me ♪ ♪ May the work I've done speak for me ♪ And-and this just, you know, when-- She like... ♪ When I've done the best I can ♪ ♪ I want my friends to understand ♪ ♪ May the works I've done ♪ You know... And it just that-- I just believe that now what I'm doing, it-- all this hard work is finally paying off, you know? And that's-- that's my goal. That was my goal all these years. Just to do good music and to get out here and be recognized. I mean, of course, you gotta become a star and all that kind of stuff. I'm not-- I never had in my head that I wanted to be a star. I think all the time when I had in my head I wanted to be a star, nothing happened. And when I just said, "You know what? I just wanna sing and use this gift and people love me, you know, for my voice, not the way I look, and enjoy my music." And that seems to be happening right now. To see my-- me. The same woman that-- the guy from Sony said I was "too fat, too black, too short, and too old." And look at me now, you know? I'm still... I lost a little weight since the chemo. Cancer, but I'm still black. And I'm-- I'm short. I'm not gonna change. I'm still 4'11 1/4", you know, but, um, I'm just a better person than-- than I-- I'm a better person than when that man told me that, because I felt bad, and I looked at myself and saw ugliness. I saw, you know-- And that's when I said-- I came home to my mother, and my mother said, you know, "You don't listen to that man," you know, "You just realize you're a beautiful, black young woman, and God blessed you with a gift, and use your gift." And so, that's-- that's all-- Looking at this, you know, that's-- that makes me think about... You know... my mother... (choking up) is not here to share some of this joy with me. But I know she's... she's watching over me. So, that's all. (dialing) Hey, Alex-- Austen here. Alex on phone: I'm just trying to balance a very delicate situation of Sharon's health, first and foremost, her mental health, and then how that effects everything moving forward from February 1st on. You know, once we hit... Austen: We're kinda coming into high-speed time. And with the record coming out the second week of January, she gets started doing a lot of promotion. For example, "Late Night Fallon," photoshoots, interviews, you know, because she's been sick, we've had to make some adjustments in terms of not piling too much on, and being very cognoscente of, you know, how she's feeling, and what three or four months is gonna look like from now. Which is not the easiest thing to predict. Where my pickle? Where my pickle? Let me see if it's the right pickle. I don't think it's the right pickle. Oh! It's the right pickle! Oh, man! I am so happy! Y'all have no idea! - I'm so glad. - Don't talk to me right now. Mm! Oh, my God! Mm! So what have you been thinking about clothing? I can't even talk right now about how I feel. This-- this is the most important thing right here-- right here! (grunts) Mm! I enjoy that meal. It makes me happy to see you so happy. Mm. Sharon: Wait, what am I doing now? Alex: Okay, so this is for Johnathan, who's a dear. - "Dear"? - Yeah, D-E-A-R. - That's so stupid. - Okay, then don't do... "Dear, Johnathan," what? You know, "Thanks for your support. See you next month." Austen: Did you see the back where it's dedicated to your mom, Sharon? That's nice. Aw. - What's next? - Write one to Barack and Michelle. 'Cause you gave her a record last time, didn't you? Yeah, that's right. "Dear, First Lady." There you go. Then he gonna get mad like, (imitating President Obama) "Well, she sent it to you and not me. I'm the President, baby." She be like, "Well, honey, I went to see her show. You didn't go to the show, so now you need to get up here... White House so she can sing, so you can see who she is." Okay. "Dear, First Lady. - I hope you enjoy"... - Alex: My new record. And get with it and get me up there at the White House soon. Okay. What's next? Remember we talked about getting the assistant tour manager kinda be - the person who takes care of you. - Uh-huh. - What's that "uh-huh"? - I'm really getting scared. I'm just looking at everything and it's freaking me out a little bit. If you want us-- if it's important to you that we have that time off, - then we'll take it off. - I'ma need some down time. I wanna, like, maybe get away and go somewhere for, you know... maybe Africa or back to Hawaii or something. - Africa? - I don't know, Alex. I'm going for it now. Like, I got a bucket list now. When you die, you gonna do everything. (laughing) I thought about that on my deathbed, so, yeah. - You weren't on your deathbed. - Yes, I was, Alex, y'all don't even know. When that doctor was sitting in there, and he came in that room. - I remember. - You know what I thought? "Give the People What They Want." I was gonna be dead and they gonna be like, "Ooh, look at Sharon." (muttering) "This her last album." I thought it was gonna be. I thought that was my last album. - I really did. - Well, it's not gonna be, - so let's not talk about it. - Okay. Sharon: Alex, I think one time, I think I made him cry. And I said to 'em all, I said, "That's all I am to y'all? Y'all don't give a shit about my sickness? Y'all don't care nothing about me? All y'all worried about is I'm on this road and y'all keep putting these jobs and you keep sending me out"-- I said, "That's all it is. So that seems what this seems like, that's all I am to you y'all is money. I'm making y'all money. Money got in your pocket. Y'all don't give a shit about me. If I, you know"... Alex like, "Don't even say that." I saw him get so... and I never said that to him again. Alex: She didn't want to do much business talk. She wanted to focus on just getting better. But I wanted to always make sure she was aware, like, "Hey, we didn't stop working and planning. Things are happening." I wanted her to make sure she had a reason to-- to get better. (sighs) How are you? You ready? Last one. - All right. - Party time. All right. Here we go. - Four, 56. - That's right. - Okay. - 75 minutes, one hour. - Okay? - Okay. All right. - Hey. - Hey, Alex. - You never met Dr. Leonardo? - No. - Alex, that's my manager. - Oh, this is... Oh, hi. - That's the Kad-man. - Pleasure to meet you. - Hi. How are you? - (Sharon laughing) Thanks for everything. See, she's always laughing in here, but her pictures, she always looks like, you know, "I dare you," you know? - Yeah, they put those mean pictures up. - I know, I know. The white coat, she tends to be really friendly around. (laughter) At some point, is there a follow-up, like, scan? Yeah, we should do a baseline scan at some point. Because the reason you want that is you wanna have something to compare to in case you have problems in the future. And, you know, lots of reason to be optimistic about it. Sharon: Yeah. Dr. Shabode told me at the hospital, he said, "I got everything." That's the thing. Okay. - Good to meet you. - Alex: Yeah, you, too. - Thanks so much for everything. - Okay. How's everyone at home? You talk to your... I'ma tell you, Alex. Everyone that called me up and asked for something, and I just said, "Yo, don't call me and ask me for nothing. I can't pay your mortgage. I can't pay your credit bills. When I get, I'll call you up and give you. Don't call me and ask me for anything." Everyone I had to do that. It's gonna be tough for me, but it's just crazy down there. I'm sorta glad-- That's why I came up here. - It's the best thing ever. - Yeah. - (machine beeping) - You did need a distraction. Nurse: Okay, you want me to disconnect ya? Ow! (sighs) - Sorry. - That's the last one, right? - Yepper. - Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Midnight, my brother died. And I remember, we were was in New Year, we were somewhere, and I was backstage and the tears just started coming down and I almost started-- I said, "I can't do this. I can't go on." And I could hear my brother, "Go on, Sharon. You know this is what you do. You better be strong. Get on our there and sing." Pfft. Right into the song. And the night when my mother died, and the band was there. Then when we on that stage and that music is out there... I have no worries in the world. I don't think about anything, any pain. Sure, there's death, but people came to see us. And the show must go on. - (cheering and applause) - Happy New Year! (music playing) Your first New Year kiss. Yeah! Whoo! Man: Graced by the presence of Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings live in studio this morning. "Give the People What They Want" is out this week. Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings live.

This is the God's honest truth. - Before I started doing hair... - Uh-huh. ...I was a phone sex operator. - Oh, what? - You were? Yes, I was a dominatrix on the phone. This is the way it goes. "What do you want, slave?" (laughing) And of course, they were like, "Your phone voice is so sexy." Like you know, you pervert, I'm saying to myself. But then, at the same token, I'm like, "Okay, I'ma need you to pin yourself, now!" And they would literally be in their office taking off their pants. Literally pleasuring themselves listening to someone talk dirty to them. Wow. (cheering and applause) I just really wanna be truthful. Thank you, guys. Um, especially all of the management, all of the work. And Dap-Kings, man, thank you, guys. I don't wanna start crying. But I really didn't think I was gonna be here. Felt so good seeing y'all on that stage last night, you know? But I'm gonna tell y'all, Alex, man... I mean, for these years, I mean, he came in my life. My life as a musician, as an artist began because he took control and he brought out stuff. He got me gigs, and, I mean, just things that to the point I trusted him with my life. And y'all don't know what it was like when I was in that hospital. And I turned around and looked and Alex was in the room right there, you know? And then when I woke up, came out of that, you know, he was right there. And when my tears fall, to see his tears fall along with my sister, I mean, that's like family. And I was telling you, man, I love you and thank God you're in my life. You know, and I really appreciate you. You know? (crying) - I really do. - (applause) - It's not gonna make up for the bills. - (laughter) Cheers to a great record. (cheering and applause) That's gorgeous. Binky: Everybody's just happy to be back and happy that she's still healthy and able to do what she needs to do. When I say "what she needs to do," it's not that doing the show for us so that we can have a job, but, like, she needs the show. That's her therapy. That's like the best therapy she could have. - Sharon: Good morning. - What can I help you with today? - I'm scheduled for a CAT scan. - Okay. What's your last name? - Jones. - And your first name? Sharon. Machine: Breathe. You guys can come back in if you want now. It's all safe. (line ringing) - Hello? - Hey, Dr. Leonardo, this is Sharon. - So, the CT scan I think is all good. - Mm-hmm. Um, there was one area of the stomach that the radiologist said, you know, he couldn't tell. It was kinda thickened, and on the CT scan you had back in July, it was also kinda thickened. But he-he thought that it's probably something that they should look at it with what they call an endoscopy. Sharon: Mm-hmm. You know, this is sort of a baseline, so that if anything happens in the future, we can, um, have something to compare it to. All right, so what do you think about that-- What about-- When can I-- Let me make a couple phone calls and see if I can get this done - sooner rather than later. - All right. - Take care. - All right, Dr. Leonardo. - Bye. - Bye. Ugh. Well, I'm just looking at the scar tissue. - Yeah. - Because, remember, they went in... - There's a lot that happens in there. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - That's not what I wanted to hear. - Yeah. - But I-I still think everything's okay. - Yeah, I do, too. I don't think it's anything crazy.

Megan: Sharon... Nurse: Yeah, it'll take her a little bit to wake up, and then she'll just go home and sleep. Megan: That's the most relaxed I've seen her in a long time. (laughs) Can I, um, her manager on the phone as well so that he can hear what you're gonna say? - Sure. - Austen and Alex. Everything looks pristine clean. - Beautiful. - Megan: Yay. - It's clean? - Yes. (cheering on phone) There is no prob-- no evidence of tumors or cancer. Megan: Good news, yeah. Okay.

Its toll to clearly say, 'My treatments are done!'" (bell ringing) One more. (cheering and applause) Bye. See y'all. Megan: One thing, you know you realize that this cancer that you had is something that you always have to respect that you have. - Yeah. - I mean, it's nothing that you can just say, "Oh, now I'm in remission. - I can... - Nope. ...do whatever the hell I want now," - 'cause you can't. - Nope. Let me tell y'all, like, I got friends. People I've known for years. But nobody have never been as friendly and as giving as you have in a lifetime, you know, you literally nursed me back to health. I gotta tell you something. - You know I never wear jewelry, right? - Yeah. And I put my grandmother's ring on. And I wanted to have as much strength... - to be there for you because... - I was so scared. I don't know what I would've done if they would've told me they found cancer and I would have to go through some other stuff. It would've freaked me out. You know, I think I would've just-- - I don't know. - You don't have to worry about that now. - Right? - I know it. That's why-- that's why-- that's why I didn't do it. And I was saying a hymn to myself. Thanks, man. (sighs) Sharon: Been in here for like seven months, so now it's the last day here. You know, gotta go back now to the hustle and bustle. And you know what, Megan? Like I said, if you can remember the picture. - How far did you get on it? - Only that little-- - over where her fingers are at. - Only. - There's just like eight zillion-- - That's a lot. That's-- that's gonna take me a while to do that, so... That's it. I'm packed. - Megan: Alex is here. - Oh, man. Okay. - (car door shuts) - All right, y'all. I gotta chill out now. - Alex is here. Damn. - (Megan laughs) Okay. - Thanks for everything. - Oh, of course. You know this is your home away from home. Thanks, man. - Bye. - See you later, Alex. Thank you so much. - Alex: You feeling okay? - Yep. And how's everything else coming? You're ready, right? - Yeah. - That doesn't sound very reassuring. Yeah, I'm not-- I'm just being truthful. I'm just not, you know... I'm just-- I'm not comfortable, you know, yet. I know how my legs are feeling still, you know? - Austen: Is it getting better? - Yeah, it's better. But I'm just saying, you know... I'm not as enthused as I should be, you know? Getting ready to get back out there and I'm not that... Like, "Yeah, I'm ready," you know? - We'll get there. - Yeah.

Austen: You know, for months, she just didn't listen to the music. (music playing) But we're kinda like-- You know, for us, it was a little bit harder to understand. You know, you have all this free time, like, listen to your record and get to know it, but she very much separated her musical self with her illness and her sick self. Binky: She stronger than she thinks she is at this point. But, you know, she'll get it. Once we get back on the stage, it'll all be much more apparent. Like where we really are, you know? - You got all the stuff? - I got your stuff. Binky: One, two. Check. All right.

Sharon: So even if I mess it up right now, don't worry about it, y'all. If she messes it up, please don't worry about it, y'all. Got you, Sharon.

So, tonight is my first night to get back out and hopefully be able to find myself. Find not the old Sharon but another Sharon. That's my concern-- getting in front of my fans looking the way I'm looking. I know how my mother's hair was falling out and how she looked. So, when I see that, I see myself, I see my mother. And I think that's what bothered me, too. In all this stuff that I'm trying to, you know, hold it in, and it keep going. And it's just, you know, it's a lot. Oh, that stuff stinks. You gotta massage the leather, that's the thing. - Right. - (laughs) Alex: Did you hear about this guy? Did you hear the news? - No. - Tonight's show trumpet player. - He's leaving. - Really? - Yeah. Sad. - Wait, for Fallon? - Yeah. - Congratulations, man. (saxophone playing scales) It's all about the beginning of the show and the end of the show. What happens in the middle-- What does my friend Bosco Man say? - Nobody remembers the middle. - Groove. And did you figure out the shoes? Sharon: I already decided my feet is what it is. I gotta have some time to myself, get my nervous together. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. - See you later. - Did she put any lipstick on... - No. (laughing) (chatter) Okay. You ready to go in? - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Saundra: We're really grateful and we just thank you so much, God. And we just wanna say thank you, thank you, thank you. - Thank you. - Bless Sharon from the top of her head to the soles of her feet, Lord God. Let her remember her lyrics and everything. - Thank you, Lord. Amen. - Amen. Gabe: Tonight, we got Dave, we got everybody tonight. - All: Yes. - Let's enjoy it. All: Dap-Kings! (cheering and applause) Ready? Here we go. Hit it. Binky: And now, ladies and gentlemen... New York, are you ready? I said, Beacon Theatre, are you ready?! (cheering and applause continues) Because, ladies and gentlemen, in our entire career, The Dap-Kings have just taken the longest time off that we have ever taken. But it had to be taken in order for Sharon Jones to kick cancer in the ass. (crowd roaring) But now that she's taken care of that, ladies and gentlemen, she's back. We're gonna welcome this young lady to the stage. Please welcome... Miss... Sharon... Jones! New York! Wake up, y'all! How y'all feel? Y'all feel all right? Hey!

Announcer: On your side. This is News 12 at 6:00. Singer Sharon Jones is recovering after a procedure to remove a small mass from her liver. I just spoke with the singer, who is still in New York right now, where doctors removed that small tumor. It's all thumbs up from her, by the way. She says her voice is strong. She feels good. She'll be heading home to Augusta soon. Right now, my attitude is, um... cancer is in your body and it never leaves. Sometimes it never flare-up again, and it could be another 10-20 years. Whatever I go in, whatever they say, I just have to deal with it. And that's the way I'm thinking for the rest of my life right now. Now we just need to sell millions of records. I wanna sell a million records. I mean, that's not easy to do nowadays, but... Yo, you gotta be positive, and you gotta say we gonna sell a million records. - We're gonna sell a million records. - There you go. - Done. - Done. Claim it. - I believe it. - Okay. - I believe it if you do. - There you go.
