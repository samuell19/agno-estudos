Look at what I brought you "When the first aeroplane was ready... ..."they invited all of their friends... ..."to witness this event "When the engine was started... ..."the two brothers were very nervous "At last the plane took off and gained altitude "And that is how man... ..."came to conquer the skies "That first pioneering flight was over 90 years ago... "Today, gigantic aeroplanes are capable of transporting people... ..."in just a matter of a few hours... ..."all the way from one side of the world... ..."across to the other side" Come in Hello Can I talk to Amaneh? Why? I brought a book Amaneh, off you go I brought you your exercise book Thank you, Ayoub Goodbye Ayoub worked hard for two months... ...but he wasn't able to earn enough money for Madi's operation He had to spend everything on us After the fight in which he broke his arm... ...our uncle offered Ayoub his mule so that they could work together Stop! Silence! Don't move! Bakhtiar! What's up? Is it an ambush? Run! It's an ambush! Which hand is it? Taher, listen... ...you are a brave man... ...and so is your son If the boy and the girl are both in agreement... ...then I'm in agreement, too I'd be very honoured... ...if you accepted my son... ...as your son-in-law The sooner good deeds are done, the better I give you my daughter In which case, I think it would be much better... ...for all of us to get this done as quickly as possible As for Madi, don't worry This evening, we'll discuss... ...how to take him to Iraq to have him operated on I'll let you know Hello Hello. Whose shoes are those? Mr Taher's and his son's Is my uncle here? Yes, he is Why are they here? I don't know Call him Why don't you call him yourself? Call him, I said Uncle, come here -Hello -Why don't you come in? Why are they here? To do a good deed What? To ask for Rojine's hand What? Why didn't you tell me? I'm your uncle. While I'm here, it's not up to you! Did you hear me? Hey, I am Rojine's brother As long as I'm around, you don't decide. Shut up! She's my sister. You didn't tell me. They must go Go away! While I'm around, you have no rights at all! Why did you behave like that? Drop it! Why didn't you tell me? What? About Taher's son I didn't know either Why are you lying? Don't ever lie to me! I'm your brother I thought he'd told you He said nothing to me Why are you so angry? Why shouldn't I be angry? Am I not the son of this family? I did it for Madi. If I get married they'll have him operated on, over there You couldn't get enough money for the operation -Is it definite? -I don't know Ayoub! Hey, Ayoub! Hello, Mr Rahim Don't move! You're a man now Men don't cry I'll come back on Thursday... ...to give him his last injection Mrs Mahboubeh, please take care of the children, I beg you What did you bring him for? I don't need him I sent for the bride. I don't want him. Take him back Uncle! Their mother says she won't let Madi come You promised. Mr Taher was in agreement Who's Taher? I don't want him. I won't stand for this I already have ten children myself We didn't receive the dowry that is normally paid The deal was that Madi would go with the bride I'm not standing for that She wants a divorce We refuse a divorce Instead of a dowry, we can give you a mule, OK? A mule, but the boy has to go back home When Madi got home, he was in a bad way There was no one to give him his injections The doctor didn't come to the village for a week Without telling my uncle, Ayoub took Madi and the mule to the bazaar He told me he would sell the mule in Iraq Over there, mules sell for a better price He said he'd have Madi operated on, then come back He told me to stay home and that he'd be back very soon -Hello -Hello there What is it? I want to go to Iraq Why? I want to sell my mule Is that all? He needs an operation Children can't get through The road's full of landmines and ambushes. It's not for kids It's for grown-ups -I'm not a child -What about him? He is No, he's not. Let us come What if something happens? I'll take full responsibility All right, if you insist Come on, but you take full responsibility You load up your mule, but we won't pay you Are you sure? OK, give this boy a load of tyres It's very cold today, so give the mules four bottles of alcohol Ayoub, hey, brother! Wait for me! Why are you here? I brought some bread for the journey Thank you Be careful and look after Kolsoum Hey, brother! What! Will you get me another exercise book? All right. I'll buy you one. Now go home I love you so much, Madi We're nearly at the border now Turn back, it's an ambush! There's an ambush this way, too! Turn back! Everyone head for the valley! They're too drunk to walk! They've had too much alcohol! Take their loads off! Maybe they'll get up! Get up! Please stand up! They're getting nearer! They're closing in on us! Mr Rahim, please help me save my mule! Rahim, please don't leave me by myself! Rahim, I must get Madi to Iraq! Please help me! Get up! Come on!
