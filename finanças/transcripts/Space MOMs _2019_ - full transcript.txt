That one, it's red! Red means it's Mars, Miss Bossy-pants! It's a good luck planet. Hey, watch out! Shanti! Wrong, Papa. Planets are going somewhere. They're always moving. Who's Aryabhatta? He lived a very long time ago. He was also obsessed with stars and planets. A stargazer, just like you. Mohan, that's not nice. Awful day Ganesh. Ten ladies decided to give but at the same time, and two of my nurses were no-shows. Mamma, first a game, please Vimala. Let them play checkers. We'll play chess. I don't know chess, Papa. I will teach you. You need real skills for chess. Like maths skills, strategy skills. It was invented here you know? 100%, "Made in India" game. It looks difficult Focus on the music, Vimala. See how beautifully mathematical it is. See? Now you can learn anything! Play. See these old computations, let's just change it and work with the new ones. Yeah? - Let's see what - Right, okay. Yeah, absolutely. We'll be fine, okay, thank you. Good work today, ladies and gents! Let's pick it tomorrow, okay? Come here. I'll make the corrections, madam. No need, I'll do it myself first thing tomorrow. Have to buy drumsticks otherwise Madhavi's going to kill us. - We'll just stop on the way - Yeah. And buy some groceries. - Hey, Prateep, how! - Hello ma'am, how are you, how's it going? - Good evening. - Good evening, Miss. - Good evening. - Good evening. How are you? Bucket list performance tonight? Look how old the dancer is. Ready, Dr. Sitaraman? Yes! I'm ready. Your dance was very fierce tonight. You became "The Destroyer" I got a message right before I went on stage. We've got the green light, Saraswati! The green light for the red planet! The Mars mission is on! You wanna go to the office? If you don't mind? Wait, wait, wait. You still have some Shiva eye make-up. - Oh. - You'll terrify your engineers. There you go. Thank you. This is our GSLV team. What's GSLV? Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. Sorry I asked! It's basically a very powerful rocket. It failed to launch a couple of times. They're still working on that. What are these pictures? They're so cute! - Good evening, sir - Good evening. Good evening, madam. Keshav, tell my wife about these pictures. We nicknamed the GSLV rocket, "Naughty Boy", madam. That's why we have these pictures. Why is the rocket a naughty boy? No matter how many time we try to program him he does his own thing. Makes my two year old twins look like angels. So near. Yet so far! Hello sir! How was your performance tonight? It went well Chandra. Hope I didn't wake you up? I'm awake sir, I've been waiting for your call. You're here Chandra? Yes sir!. I came here as soon as I got the message. I knew you'd come here. Oh! Saraswati. You remember Dr. Chandra Kumar, our Deputy Chairman, don't you? Well. We got what we wanted, sir. I suppose we should start assembling our mission teams, sir? No, not yet, Chandra. Only you and I know we've got the green light. We have to keep things quiet until the official announcement. Okay, mum's the word. No. MOM's the word. Mars Orbiter Mission. Acronym, MOM. The big news today is on space exploration. India will send a satellite to Mars. The Cabinet has approved what is being called the Mars Orbiter Mission. Did you know about this Mars mission, Shanti? No. Will you work on it? I... I don't know. It's making me tense. I'm going to be tense until I know I've been picked to work on the mission. Relax, honey. I believe in my Skywalker. Hmm. How about you gazing at your homework, Alok? You still have two more pages to go. The cabinet has approved what is being called the Mars Orbiter Mission. The satellite will collect important scientific information from the red planet. I knew something was up! The Chairman was humming happy ragas for the past two months. Me or you. I hope at least one of us gets on the Mars team, Vimala. Why be so modest in our hopes? Let's hope both of us get in! What's clear is, I'm not going to get in! Even these application forms are so hard! I can't even figure these out! How am I ever going to get into IIT? Just focus on one item at a time, Madhavi. We'll go line by line, okay? Cauliflower cutlets for lunch? Prakash Subramanya special, extra chilies. The cabinet has approved what is being called the Mars Orbiter Mission. Hello? Ponni? Oh, hello, Ma! We are going to track the Mars Orbiter! Hooray! You knew we were going to be chosen, Ravi? You came prepared with sweets? Pure coincidence, madam. I, I just got engaged. The sweets are for that. Thank you, thank you. Sincere sympathies to the bride. At least I got engaged. Hardware team for the Mars Mission has been chosen. Sounds like Gun-Throat Mahalingham. Hardware team for the Mars Mission has been chosen. Hardware team confirmed! Did you all hear that? Did we have a choice? Gun-Throat, sir? Do you know if the software team's been chosen? Not yet madam. But they will be, by 5:00 p.m. They've chosen who'll build the body ogf the orbiter. Now they'll choose who will build the brain. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I can't believe it, I'm on the software team! I have to run now, - we have our first meeting. - Congratulations, ma'am. We are happy! I have to run, we have our first meeting! I hope Prakash also got selected, he's not answering his cell. Congratulations. I knew that, I knew that she would be our team member. I told you that. Okay, I'll catch you later. Dev, are you there? I didn't make it. The Mars Mission. They didn't choose me. I... I guess I'm not good enough. Shanti Srivastava! Shanti Srivastava? Yes, sir? They are waiting for you, madam. Who, sir? The Mars Mission software team, madam. Your meeting's supposed to have started six minutes ago. The software team? I... I was chosen? Don't you check your office emails, Mrs. Shanti? I didn't. I thought they chose everyone they wanted? They did. And they chose you. Run, madam. They're in Room 2219. Shanti Srivastava! Come in, come in. Hope you don't find it too sunny in here! Take a good look my friends. This will be our 24/7 preoccupation for the next 14 months. So, spend some time with your families tonight, you won't be seeing much of them in the coming months. You have an important role in the Mars Mission. But, you must remember, that many others in many other teams have roles just as important as yours. Our colleagues in the hardware team next door to our building will build the orbiter. Our colleagues in the instruments team will build the camera and the instruments. Our colleagues in the tracking center downstairs will track our orbiter every moment, from its launch to its orbits around Mars. All of you will work under the guidance of your team leads. Mrs. Shanti. And Mrs. Vimala. And you'll build the orbiter's software. Its Brain. I'm anticipating to fly, you know? Seriously, oh my god. Thank you. I'm sorry, Prakash. Why? I'm not. Not everyone can be chosen Vimala. The main thing is you made it. I couldn't be happier. What's Shanti like? She's on the same floor, but I don't know her. She's been just transferred from Ahmedabad. Well, her reputation is that she's brilliant, but a loner. And very strict. Vasan! - Bye, Pinky! - Bye. After conceding 18 in the first over. Gets an opportunity to come back and he's done well. The away. One of the great evenings that you will see in one-day cricket. 90 off 75 balls, and India 177 for 4. Oh, hello everyone. Hello, Mama. Mohan. How are you? What's going on? Our stupid TV conked out again. - Do you get Star? - Well actually, Vimala's had a big day at work. How can I study with this noise? Tell them to go? I can't do that, Madhavi. We'll go to your room with your books and shut the door. I'll bring you some ginger tea. Mama likes cardamom. Okay. Surprise! Surprise. - Congratulations Stargazer. - We are so proud of you. Thank you, mama, papa. Why all this fuss? You know I hate surprises. Why? What's the occasion? What's the occasion? You getting on the Mars team, of course! Yes, I got into the Mars team. They even made me a team lead. I don't want to fail. I'm gonna need your help. Both of you. Don't make messes for me to clean. It's best if you don't get into the kitchen. Believe me, Dev. It's much easier for me to do everything myself, than clean up after you. And you, little man, finish your homework before you go to sleep. No matter how late I get home I will still check your work, okay? How did the first meeting go with your software group? Good madam. For a complicated mission like this they're a really young team. One of the team leads is barely over 30. Which one? She who never smiles. Shanthi Srivastava. The other lead is she who always smiles, sheepishly. Vimala Subramanya. Hmm. The two chiefs personally chose Shanti and Vimala as team leads. Oh. Yes. Shanthi's a perfectionist, she'll be the first to spot any problems, Dr. Sitaraman said. And the other one? Vimala's the one the junior engineers will find approachable. She'll teach the youngsters, and maybe teach Shanti the value of teamwork, while Shanti teaches Vimala a thing or two about self-confidence. That's what Dr. Chandra said. Ah-ha! Found it! Can I give you a ride, madam? No, thank you. I have an appointment. MNS? Oh, ho! We should definitely invite them. I don't think we should invite anyone for our wedding. Come on. Hey, that's my boss. The one in the sandal sari, Dr. Ponni Shanmugam. I told her about us, the wedding. What did she say? She said, "You miserable bastard. Why are you ruining your life? Stay single and enjoy the good life." She's going in there! That's interesting. Miss Ponni has a side to her that I never knew. Why? What's in that building? Thank you for coming. India is sending an orbiter to Mars. We'll tell you about the mission, then answer your questions. The best date to enter Mars's orbit will be September 24, 2014, when Mars and Earth are close to one another. That's our entry date. The journey from Earth to Mars will take about 300 days. Working backwards from the entry date, we must launch the orbiter from Earth 10 months earlier. We've picked October 28, 2013 as our launch date. That gives us what? 14 months to design and build the orbiter from scratch? Very aggressive deadline, I say. Our budget is rupees 450 crores. That's 74 million in US dollars. The US mission to Mars cost almost 10 times our budget. No country that succeeded in the Mars mission did so on the first try, not even the US. But we don't have the budget for trial and error. We therefore, intend to become the first Asian nation to place a spacecraft into Mars's orbit, and the first country in the world, do it on the very first try. Make no mistake, you're well aware of the odds against us. Our dream is in inverse proportion to our resources. How can we even hope to succeed? Hope's not the unique property of wealthy nations, nor is success something only they can enjoy. Big budgets and pricey equipment are wonderful. But a curious mind that is not afraid to try is the best equipment for science. The sun, the moon, the stars, the various planets, these belong to all nations, to all people. All women and men everywhere, regardless of income or status, are free to gaze at the skies and ponder their mysteries. And our ancient Indian astronomers have been doing it a lot longer than anyone else. Space exploration is in the Indian DNA. So I say to the red planet, "Watch out, my friend. Here we come." We heard the big bosses. We launch in 14 months. And we all heard Gun-Throat Mahalingham downstairs. "It's a very aggressive deadline!" Let's start. We don't have time to waste! We're here in Bangalore, which is India's Silicon Valley in India's Space City. What India's attempting to do with their Mars Orbiter Mission seems like a Mission Impossible. Remember, not even the United States conquered the red planet on the first try. Are we still allowed to say third world? Absolutely not. - It's developing country. - Developing country, okay. Chairman Dr. Sitaraman unveiled plans for reaching Mars on a timetable that was nothing, if not ambitious. The question remains whether there is a disconnect between India's lofty ambitions and the shoestring India's able to devote to achieving those ambitions. And a large question remains as well. With all the poverty that exists in this developing country, is this how India should be spending its money? Hope's not the unique property of wealthy nations. But a curious mind that is not afraid to try is the best equipment for science. The sun, the moon, the stars, the various planets, these belong to all nations, to all people. The Maven Mission was developed by NASA to study Mars's atmosphere. The launch will take place in November 2013. The launch vehicle will be the powerful Atlas V. The Atlas V rocket uses an RD-180 engine to power its first stage, and an RL-10 engine to power its - Centaur upper stage. - Madam? Madam! - Hello, grapes Madam? - The Atlas V first stage is 106.6 feet long. It is powered by a single RD-1808 main engine. Shanti? What's wrong? NASA America's space agency, they just put out a video on their upcoming Mars mission. I think we have a huge problem, Dev. No way our PSLV-C25 can put our orbiter on a direct path to Mars. The C25s just not powerful enough. The GSLV rocket would be, sir. Naughty Boy. GSLV can do the launch. It's way more powerful than the PSLV-C25. Yes, our dear Naughty Boy. You think Keshav's team can get the Boy ready in time for the October launch? Let's find out. Keshav, do you think we can get Naughty Boy working in time for our Mars launch? No? Good morning, Shanti. It's not a good morning. Let's go outside, Shanti. Our rocket, PSLV-C25, it's not strong enough, Vimala. I saw NASA's video last night. We don't have a powerful rocket like the Americans. If we don't have a suitable rocket, we can't launch our orbiter, and if we can't launch our orbiter then, there won't be a Mars Mission. No Shanti, we can't think like that! Right now, the best thing we can do is continue to build our software. How can we do that when we know the mission has a bigger problem? That's like Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Nothing's burning, yet. Someone will come up with a solution. There's a whole big team- A whole big team of Nero's still can't stop Rome from burning. But we will solve the problem. No, you don't understand. I'm sorry, madam. I'll make the correction. It'll be quicker if I just do it. Let him do it, Shanti. He'll get it right. Let's say I don't have a powerful king. Or a queen. My rocket's only as strong as a pawn. How do I still win the game, with you? In a roundabout way? Huh? Weaklings can't win in a direct straight way. A weakling has to do things in a roundabout way. Madhavi, come have your tea. A roundabout way? How can we launch with a weak rocket? That's the question. That has to be the question! To not launch is not an option! If there's an answer, sir, I'm too tired to see it. That makes two of us. You better get moving, Chandra. You have a long drive. Today I'm going to teach you a song called Aigiri Nandini. It was composed by a rishi thousands of years back. It's for Durga, how beautiful she is, how kind, how fierce. It's a girl-power song! Yes, yes, indeed. - Chick power. - Chick power, chick power! Hello? Yeah. This rocket problem has sucked the life out of me. I've reached a dead-end, Saraswati. My mind is empty. I've nothing left in me. You're talking like "The Destroyer!" Remember the time you did the dance of the Creator when you were 25? I want you to get into his mind. The mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator? If you spin the ball when you bowl, Papa, the batter won't know what to do! It's batsman. Yeah, him too! See, if I do this Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. Mind of the Creator. The Creator. The Creator. The Creator. The Creator. That's the way to do it! What? I know, I know how to do it! I know how we can launch with our weak rocket! Creator. Creator. Creator. Creator! Creator! Everything's going to be fine, they're going to make our launch date! It looks like even not so great minds think alike, and many of us arrived at the same solution. Inspired by images as, as diverse as Vishnu's discus and a child's spinning ball. Not to mention ripples in an urn and a pawn on a chessboard. This sort of synchronicity happens when many minds focus on a problem. It's one of the most magical aspects of teamwork. We'll use the weaker rocket, the PSLV-C25, and we'll use the flight plan we discussed. What's going on? Are you all bullying my son? They're not bullying me, Mama! We're not bullies, Madam. We're congratulating your son, for you! This is you, right? It's an American site. The usual nonsense about how backward Indian women are, and how me and my colleagues are only a bit less backward than the rest. Women who feel backward, could not be doing the sort of work we do. Your work. It sounds so exciting, madam. I read online something about flight plans for the Mars mission. Can you tell us about it? - Um... - Please, ma'am. - Please, ma'am - Please, ma'am Okay. A quick demonstration. First a question. What do you need to launch an orbiter in space? Geeks! Money. No. I mean something practical like a tool. Rocket. Yes! Rocket. A powerful rocket. Like what NASA has can launch the orbiter on a straight path to Mars, zip! Unfortunately, we don't have such a rocket. So we asked ourselves, can we use our weak rocket to launch the orbiter? Our weak rocket will first launch the orbiter. The orbiter will orbit around the Earth six times. Each orbit will get faster, and faster, and until on the sixth orbit- - Zip! Yes. Zip! Until zip! The orbiter will break out of Earth's gravity and head for Mars. Wow, Madam, thank you. You're welcome. Come on little guy. The auto's waiting. Hey guys, Alok's mom is so cool. She's a Space Mom! Vikram, the tall guy, is the school captain. Thank you for making me look good. NASA has, can launch the orbiter on a straight path to Mars, zip! Why is it doing this? There must be some flaw in our model. But we'll figure it out. Right? We have no choice but to figure it out. Let's start again. This, this last input? It's not working. Can you tell me why? Why, Arjun? Yeah, we need to change Back to squares zero. We'll pick it up tomorrow, Shanti. It's getting really late. Please? We'll start very early tomorrow. I eat constantly with all the stress. We should apply Martian standards for my weight. Because in Mars objects weigh only one third what they weigh on Earth! If you're going to apply Martian standards, remember that a Martian year is worth two Earth years. We'll have half the time to do our mission and we're already lagging behind. It's Diwali. We missed Diwali. Where's Alok? He's sleeping. Was he upset that I wasn't here? He understands. He knows his mama is a very busy lady. I missed Diwali, Dev! He must wish his mother was like other mothers. Other mothers don't send orbiters to Mars, Shanti. I think Alok gets that. He's not as hard on you as you are yourself. Come to bed, Shanti. You need to sleep at least a few hours. Okay, stand here all night and stare at your precious planets. They are a lot easier to deal with than human beings. Happy Diwali, sweetheart. I fully intend to have a happy Diwali. Okay. Come Prakash! Oh, Keshav called me yesterday. Wants to know if I can join the GSLV team. Our dear Naughty Boy. Yeah. What did you tell Keshav? Well, I wanted to ask you first. I mean, if I joined the Naughty Boy team it'll mean both of us will have around the clock schedules and Madhavi's IIT entrance test is coming up. The Boy's an important project. True Think of all the satellites he can launch. Yeah. You should join Keshav's team, Prakash. You and I, we'll manage. We always do. Okay, did you check his homework? Did he, you know, because you got a B+ on that test? Yeah, but I want you in bed by 12:00, okay? No watching TV and drink your milk! I'm gonna be back home by, I don't know, a little later than usual. I'll get a little late. No, don't worry, I'll wake you up at five. Five's okay, right? Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there, okay? But, thanks! There's a complication. We're going to need two more antennas, sir. It's because of our flight plan with the orbiter doing six orbits around Earth. The Pacific Ocean's a huge part of the Earth. So we'll need antennas in the Pacific to track the orbit as it flies overhead? My team's calculations show that these antennas have to be set up near here. We'll have to lease two ships then, and dispatch them with antennas to the location. We'll also have to send some of our engineers on the voyage to set up the antennas. Ravi, how would you like to go on a ship? I wouldn't madam, I can't swim. Don't worry. The ship can. Is it, is it October 28th? No, it is October 5th. I'm going to go to work. - It's 4:00 am, Shanti. - I can't sleep. Okay. - Let me take you there- - No, no, no. You go to sleep, I'll be fine. Go to sleep. You couldn't sleep, too? No. No, no, leave it. I like it. There was music from the temple when I was small and looking at the stars. This reminds me of that. Some ragas are good for problem solving. My dad used to say that- - Ready to start? There's still a flaw in our model, Vimala. It could be a fatal flaw. Not fatal, Shanti. We'll fix it. That's in three weeks. We're running out of time. Madam! Is something wrong? One of our ships, the ships we sent to Fiji with the antenna. There's a big storm in the Pacific. The ship's in trouble. No communication's possible with the ship. The Port authorities in Fiji are working hard. That poor guy Ravi. What happens to our launch date? What happens to our launch date? If the ship's not in place, we can't launch on the 28th. We can't control the storm, Shanti. We are powerless. I hate being powerless. No one likes it, Shanti, but storms don't care. Mantras were invented for times like this. Aigiri Nandini, Aigiri Nandini, Aigiri Nandini. Yes, one of our ships is stuck in a storm. And yes, that does put our launch date in jeopardy. We are not abandoning the mission. What mission? Dr. Sitaraman, can't even make the launch on the date you planned! Why are we wasting time and money and resources on these fantasy escapades? Hey! Dr. Sitaran, sir. We are in position now, sir. We should get the antenna up and ready as soon as... Excuse me, sir! The new launch date's still within our window, but just barely. We've lost almost all our margin for error. Don't think, "Oh great, now we have more time. We still have a massive problem. The orbiter must increase its ellipsis each time it orbits the Earth. It's been failing in our tests. In real life, we won't get many chances. We aren't America, we don't have that kind of budget. Everything has to perform perfectly! And it will. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Yay! Everyone is talking about the launch, Shanti. The whole world's watching us! And that's supposed to reassure me how exactly? Please! That's it! I'm going! Where, sir? Where our people have always gone for peace of mind. I'm going "Om!" Try this. Yeah. Contact has been made? Yeah, we are all set. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, ignition! Yes! Congratulations! The rocket's nearing the Pacific Ocean. Now's when the orbiter must separate from the rocket. The first person to know if it did so will be Ravi. If he's not throwing up! Separation successful! Hmm. We got three down. Great, ma'am, great! I don't mean to be negative, but we do have three more orbits to execute. One, I'll just be there. Look, these units are fine, you shouldn't worry so much. Yeah, it's actually taken care of. Ah! Are you okay, Shanti? Of course. Why wouldn't I be? The fourth orbit starts today. Come on, focus on your computer screens not on my face. Gladly. This isn't good. It needs to go faster. This is exactly what I was worried about. It's okay, Shanti. It's not okay, Vimala. The engine is underperforming. Yes, we all see that. But we can't focus on that. This is what I was worried about. Shanti, you're burning! I'm not. Don't make a fuss. Shanti, you should go home. Don't be silly, Vimala, I'm not leaving when we have such a big problem. You need to go home and rest, Shanti. Think of it this way, Shanti. You don't want to get us all sick, do you? The longer we're exposed to you. I'm sorry Shanti! Trust your team! We won't let you down. Hey, I want to remind you, Madhavi's entrance exam's tomorrow morning. Oh, yes, I remember. We have a crisis here. I have to work all night. The engine underperformed on the fourth orbit. Oh no. What do we do? I can't take off, Vimala, this very Naughty Boy. I can't wait until it's up and running, so I can give him a good spanking. Get back to him. And don't worry, I'll figure something out for Madhavi. Okay. Why can't Madhavi take a bus? Buses aren't reliable, Mohan. The exam starts at eight in the morning. If she's late, they won't let her take it. I have to go to work, Vimala. And Asha doesn't get up that early. She's not a morning person. Can't you make some other arrangement? Hello, hello? Stupid battery! I have an urgent errand. Please do the best you can. I, I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise. I'll take Madhavi to her exam. And don't worry, she's going to ace it. Science is in her blood. Go Vimala. Go and do what I know you can do. Send your orbiter to Mars. Madam? Come in, madam. You feel better, Shanti? Much better. My husband, he made me a herbal drink with ginger and turmeric, and, Ah, yes. The old Ayurvedic remedy. I never got married, never wanted to. I was, I am, very happy on my own. But I can still spot a good husband when I see one. You have a good man, Shanti. Shanti, I would like to take you to a, special place. Will you come with me? Any newcomers? Welcome. Welcome to the Laughing Club. Laughing club? You heard right. It started in Mumbai. A doctor created it. What do you all do? We all laugh! So much better than moping. Laugh! Nice garden, right? One of the few places in the city where you can hear birds. Reminds me of the village where I grew up. And I would have remained there... But for my mother. She gave me my... My escape velocity. We have to get the engine to pick up speed. The problem's fuel sir. Each orbit consumes fuel. We already have one failed orbit. If we blow our fuel on these orbits there won't be enough get to Mars! Come on, let's calculate if we have enough fuel for one more try. We're unable to take your call at the moment. Please leave a message at the tone. Vimala, please pick up if you're there. Vimala? I think I have the solution to our engine problem. We have the fuel, just about, for one engine boost, sir. Last chance. Can we do it? I hope so. "Hope so," is not good enough. Again. Can we do it? Yes. - Yes - Yes. - Yes, yes, - Let's go for it. When the orbiter is at its furthest point in the ellipsis. When the orbiter's at its furthest point in its orbit, when it's here, let's give it a monster boost. Like a slingshot. Yes. That should give it the push it needs, the velocity. Escape Velocity. Escape velocity. Let's go for it. Thank you, thank you so much, congratulations. - Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. Thanks. Oh, gosh, haven't showered in a day, I, I smell awful. You're allowed to. You are an awesome leader. Of the most awesome team! Not one auto, or taxi. Or even a bus. Is there a transportation strike? Must be. They forgot to tell us. Did you see that stupid "Women Are From Mars" article? These people in the West, do they understand anything about us? My theory, they see everything only through their own lens. We live in a poor country and we dress differently so we must be backward. But our God's a Goddess. And she's a warrior, too. Which is why I think our women study, achieve- - Send spaceships to Mars. - Hopefully. - Hopefully. We've walked all the way to my house, Shanti. See, that building on the corner? That's where I live. Spend the night at my place, Shanti. Call your husband and tell him. You can go home in the morning. Prakash, this is Shanti Srivastava, my teammate, my friend. I'm telling you, Alok, your dad is a much better cook. I was just going to clean up the crumbs. Don't worry about the crumbs. Give me a slice, no butter. I don't live on Mars, I have to watch my weight. Has your papa checked you're homework? Then, I'm sure it's fine. There, was that so hard to say? You have no idea. - Miss! - Miss! Straight out of Earth's gravity. What a smooth projection. 300 days to Mars. The job isn't over. We must be vigilant. Let's think positive. Here's a story in the newspaper. A nice one for a change. They did solid research these kids. They wrote about satellites being used to predict weather patterns and space technology. Now I know what parents feel like when they send their kids to faraway places. I may know that feeling soon. Madhavi's applied to IIT. If she gets accepted, she'll have to leave home. There's no IIT in Bengaluru. She'll go far away, like the orbiter. That's our code name for the orbiter. What? Madhavi. When our orbiter enters Mars's orbit, we'll say, "Madhavi's gotten into IIT." Our orbiter's insertion into Mars will be in three days, roughly at 7:30 am on September 24th. Close to 7:00 am, the orbiter will approach Mars, and then it will go behind it. For about 30 minutes the orbiter will be hidden by Mars and will be out of our line of sight. So there'll be no way for us to know if the orbiter was successfully captured by Mars's gravity or not. When the moment of truth arrives, it will be too late. Come on, you all can't want to go to the bathroom at the same time! Wardrobe change Gun-Throat, sir. We all want to watch the Mars entry in our best saris. You can launch satellites all day. Apply eyeliner in a straight line? Forget it. Can we go to a temple for a quick prayer, Vimala? He's wasting his talent as an auto driver. Should be an action movie star. Be serious. Please let me... Please let us succeed. The moment of truth. I hope NASA isn't watching. I hope so, too. Oh, no! It's my wedding sari. Go to the bathroom and clean it with cold water. Go immediately or the stain will set. Do I have time? Five minutes. Run! What happened? Madhavi. Madhavi got into IIT. Aah! Damn, that was good! I hope NASA was watching! I hope so too! NASA sends its congratulations. The Prime Minister wants to congratulate us, sir! You're every bit as beautiful as when I first saw you. Bright, and bold. And completely unreachable. Until now! Papa! - Congratulations, Skywalker! - Stargazer, Papa! - I knew you- - I'm so proud of you. Yes! We are going to invite our friends, and we celebrate today. Congratulations. - Congratulations! - That was brilliant. I always assumed that you would achieve something like this.
