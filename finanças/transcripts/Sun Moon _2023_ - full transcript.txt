Kelsey? Open the door. Go away. You're gonna destroy the resale value of this dress. Come on, Kelsey. Come on. Oh, my-- Come on. Kelsey. Okay. What the--? I don't wanna pick the wrong one. It's ice cream, Kels. Not a man. Hey, girls. -Oh, Lord, can we run? -Too late. -Hey, Maida. -Hey. Honey, have you been sleeping? Too much. My darling, you must have needed it. I'm sorry to hear about-- -What do people call it? -What they've always called it. Getting left at the altar. You're gonna find everything's gonna be all right. You're gonna take a vacay. Go on a mission trip, you know? You never know where and when and how it's gonna happen. You know? How much older are you than your sister? I'm 27. Okay, well, keep praying. Keep praying. Liz, you're gonna be at church tonight at the mission spotlight, right? -Yes. Thank you for reminding me. -You're welcome. Oh, and, Kelsey, you're gonna be able to come and gather your things. Okay. Okay. I am not doing that. What if he's there? I can't see him now. I'm not doing it. Don't be late. Okay. Kelsey, what are you doing? We have to go. Looking for a vacay. -Oh, wait, I wanna go there. -Yeah, me too. But who's got that kind of money? Well, you could sell the wedding swag. Or go with Habitat for Humanity. -I mean, you never know how or when-- -Oh, stop it! I gave up my apartment, I quit my job, everything to be the perfect wife, and what do I get? Pity. And lame advice. While he gets a free pass because he used the magic words, "The Lord told me." Oh, I have some magic words for him. What happened to sweatpants? Do you want your cake back or not? Let's go! Hey. -How's she doing? -She's okay. Mina. -Hey. -Sorry, not taking questions. What are you doing? Keys. I'm gonna put this in the car and wait there. -Kelsey. -I can't, Liz. There's too many... everything. Cake. -Hey. -Just-- I gotta-- I'm late. -I thought you weren't coming. -Maida. So thanks for supporting us as we serve the Lord in the heart of Asia. Hello from Taiwan. We are so happy to come to America. Jesus loves you. Any questions before we wrap up? Me. Do you have any advice for the young people who may be struggling with disappointment and need to listen to God? Amen. There's no formula, if that's what you mean. How are they gonna know God's will? I definitely felt called to mission. Me, I had plans that fell through, so I took a teaching job in Taiwan on a whim. Worked out well for us. I think God uses everything. The way you love, the way you hurt, your mistakes, your whims. I guess if you're stuck, maybe take a leap of faith. What movie are we watching? Disney. Mulan. Appropriate. He offered me a job. -Who? -The guy from Taiwan. Cool. Doing what? Teaching. In Taiwan. What? He knows the principal. And they always need teachers. -But Taiwan? -I'm taking a leap of faith. Okay? There's nothing for me here. Me. Mom. Someone has to pay for Mom. And you're still in college. It's just for a semester. Just for a semester? Please, Liz. I cannot take it. The gossip, the questions. "You're how old?" "Why did you drive him away?" "Braden heard from God. Why didn't you?" -I need a win, Liz. -It's your life. Do whatever. Where does Mom keep the old-lady tea? This is a job. I'll send money home. And Mom never remembers me when I do visit. The doctors say she's stable for now. And how is being gone one semester going to hurt? It's Braden. -Why is he calling you? -I don't know. -What do I do? Do I answer it? -No. I don't know. Just... What do you want? Why are you telling me all this? Are we okay? No, I don't think so, Braden. I don't think we're okay. Why don't you ask yourself that? And while you're at it, why don't you find a new church that doesn't buy your lame "because God told me" excuses! I know it's a mess, but feelings change. And I'm in love with Ashlyn. Please just try and understand. Never call us again. What? What? He's in love with Ashlyn. Ashlyn, your college roommate? They've covered a lot of ground since then. Hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Any guy who would blow up everything with you for some airhead in a strapless dress doesn't deserve you, okay? -Seriously? -I'm sorry. Okay, we need to go... on a field trip. Let's go. Is this a bad idea? This is a bad idea. It's a part of the healing process. Is that Ashlyn's car? You should go. To Taiwan? -You're okay with that? -No. You're gonna call me, right? -Get off! -No. -Do you hate me? -Yes! Now go before I start crying. Taiwan Adventist Academy? Thanks. Hello? Excuse me. I'm looking for... Mr. Li Ming. My English not good. Right. Principal Li Ming? Li Ming? Oh, thanks. Ms. Kelsey. You very good, very good recommendation. Because I speak English? You travel okay? I-- Long. Three planes, 22 hours. So it's... Just in time. To...? To teach the class good English. What is this net? Oh, this? This is-- -A Bible story. Five loaf, two fish. -Right. -Fishnets. -Okay. Kidding. Safety. Let's go. This is the teachers' office. Your desk. Come. -We ready. We ready for you. -Got it. And my classroom? Yes. This is teaching schedule. This is a lot. Easy for you. Yeah. Your class is mostly eighth grade. Homeroom. First period. And every Monday, Friday is chapel. -Chapel. -Chapel. Chapel. Everybody has to go to chapel. Great. If you have any questions, you can ask Horace. Horace is a homeroom teacher. Okay. All right. -Okay? -Okay. This is what we use to teach class. Okay. It's time to go to the class. Follow me. Please. Please. Kelsey. This is your class. -Please. -Okay, okay. Hello. My name is Kelsey. Do any of you speak English? Good. Okay. I am Teacher Kelsey. Teacher? -Are you from America? -Yes. Are you a movie star? Yes, you are so beautiful. You look like movie star. Like Fast and Furious. Do you watch American movies? Yes, Fast and Furious. Did you see? Oh, no. What other movies have you seen? -Batman. -Mission: Impossible. Ant-Man. Spider-Man. Chicago. Hey, hey, hey. Okay? Okay. Thank you. All right. One at a time, please. What other movies have you seen? Teacher, Trisha says... there's a girl and she love a beast. Beauty and the Beast. Other movies? -Lion King. -Frozen. -Batman. -Disney. Avengers. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you help me? Okay? Okay. Guess that's the only English word you know. I am not okay. I don't know what I'm doing. I can't go back, and I refuse to admit one more failure, you know? No, you don't know. Thank God you don't understand English because this is embarrassing. -I-- -Little. Okay, thanks. Okay? Awesome. Thanks. What have I done? -Teacher. -Yes, Benny. Why you're so tired? Cockroaches. They fly. That is unjust. Roll call. Please answer when I call your names. You all have English names? Our old teacher give to us, or sometimes we pick. Okay. Benny. Yes. -Rachel. -Here. -Morgan. -Here. Trisha. Evan. Evan. Hey, hey, quiet down. -What is your name? -Calvin. I don't see you on my list. Teacher, he ninth grade, but English so bad. No, I not. No, I am not. What class are you supposed to be in? Oh, I stay here. You go to your class, Calvin. Okay. Bye-bye. -Bye. -Bye. Good morning. I said, good morning. Good morning. Okay. Thank you. Okay, today, you are going to-- Hello? Trisha. Today, you are going to tell me about you. Of course it is. Sit up. Right. Today, we are working on I-N-G verbs. Page three, please. This is for something that is happening now. I am speaking. You are listening. Just look at the verbs on the page, add I-N-G to them. I'm boring. Actually, Trisha, if you are boring, then we are bored by you. If you're bored, you're not trying. Or maybe you should be teacher. Don't be boring, Trisha. Kelsey. Chapel. Lazarus died. Hey, Horace. Yes, Kelsey. Where can I find Wi-Fi in the apartment? Like... Phone. I don't-- Sorry. The signal is better near a window. Oh, okay. Got it. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I've kept you. You must be starving. Go enjoy your lunch. -Hey, Liz. -Hey. Got the Western Union money. That's a nice chunk of change. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I even splurged on a second-hand couch. And I made progress as a teacher. I'm getting the noise level down. -No small feat. -Thank you. I taught I-N-G words. -That's called the gerund. -Whatever. And I silenced a problem child. A temporary victory, but I'll take it. I also sat through chapel. You went to chapel? It's compulsory. Kelsey, God did not burn you. Braden did. I know. I did let it happen. You realize how boring your middle-class, white-girl sob-story is, right? Okay. Tell me about your exciting life. Oh, well, I am about to meet my thesis professor because... It's a Mom thing. I need to ask for more time on a paper. How can he not understand your situation? Oh, because he's a guy. He compartmentalizes everything. Academics in this box, family catastrophe in that box. No clue as to how they would affect each other. -Hope he's not married. -Divorced. Oh, there you go. Mom's fine, by the way. Liz, I'm sorry I didn't ask. I'll process it when I'm ready. It's just-- It's taking everything in me to get through the day with my sanity intact. Are you still there? Yep. Oh, Professor Clueless is calling. Got to go. Love you. You can do this. I can't do this. -Stupid. -It is not. I came all the way from America to teach you. What did you say? Nobody care about English. I'm done. Trisha, go to the office. Now. Where were we? Things that make us happy. Trisha need to be in class. I need my class to be a safe, fun place. No, no, no. You don't understand. Here in Taiwan, school is serious. No fun. I think you can learn from Teacher Horace. He can really teach. Is it good? I have a question. How did you learn to work with the students? By doing it wrong first a lot. Oh, yeah. -You laugh. -Sometimes. Learn? No, everyone will see. Try. Okay. All right. -Good. Good. Okay. -Okay. And then: You want me to go? Okay. Okay. Okay. -The-- -Helmet. Okay. -Yes. -Right. Yeah, that's probably smart. I don't know what I'm doing. Well, I'm here, if you care. Hello. Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Really? Did you all get into trouble? Yes. We are so bad. Yes, you are. Teacher, don't be angry. -Why? -Because I am so cute. Teacher, you like Taiwan boy? -What? -Like our teacher. Yes, you and teacher. Horace? So cute. And now we go to your wedding. No, no, no. Horace and I are just friends. Only work together. Tell them what I'm saying. Oh, no. Teacher, why you not have boyfriend? Because mine left me. Why? He left me at the altar. He thought my friend was more beautiful than me, so he didn't come to the wedding. Ouch. -Do you have pictures of your friend? -Not anymore. Yes, on the Instagram. -Teacher, please. -Please. -Please. -Please. Please. Okay, fine. Oh, no. You are more beautiful. You think so? -Yes. -Yeah. Now you can get new boyfriend. Yes, Taiwan boyfriend. Okay. Thank you. That is enough. Bye-bye. I am not mad. I just wanna know why. I don't like. But why? Because I stupid. No, you aren't. English is hard, but you are so smart. I will help you. Do you have a favorite story? From the Bible? Sure. Pick one and I will help you learn it. And no more of this. Okay? It's not nice. Yes. -Teacher, you want to go to night market? -What's that? No! Squid. You wanna try? No, thank you. That's... Teacher. Stinky tofu. No, thank you, I'm good. That smells horrible. Teacher, do you like boba nai cha? I'm afraid to find out. No, no. Thank you. I don't trust them. No, it's sweet. That is so good. Yes. So good, teacher. Yes! Thank you. Well... Bye-bye, Horace. Horace... Can you show me where to find more nai cha? Tomorrow? Sure. Lunch or something? -Okay. -Okay. Okay. Thank you. It's okay. -It's good. -Yeah. I can't be great at everything. This is actually hard. So how come you don't speak English? You can teach. Me? Teach you? You English teacher. Only if you teach me Chinese. What'd he say? Learn Chinese. "To everything, a season. A time for everything under the heaven." Does anyone know what this is? -Yeah. -A ribbon. Very good. "Time to break. Time to build. Time to plant." -Hi. -Hi. I want-- -I wanna do... -Ruth? -Yeah. -Yeah. "Time to pick up." "Time to hug. Time to not hug. Time to cry. Time to dance." The things you talk about during school. Yeah. So true. Bye-bye. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. So when are you gonna show me Taiwan? Show me Taiwan. You ride? Yeah, I'll ride. -Sun Moon Lake. -This is so beautiful. Why didn't you take me here sooner? What? How'd you get there? Run? Okay. Ready? Thanks. You all right? Yes. What are your dreams, you know, for the future? Dreams for the future. Hard question. The school, it's family. But what about your family? Parents? No more. You? Dreams? I'm leaving in a week. I only agreed to one semester. And I need to go home. My mother and sister need me. After that, no idea. Family... everything. You go... is good. The stars are brightly shining It is the night of our dear savior's birth Teacher, Rachel play for Christmas show. No! Nobody watch. But we're watching you now. You stay and be there. -Teacher, stay! -Stay! Stay! Stay! Enough. Let's get started. This is my last class before I go home to America. You need to be nice to me. Will you come back? Maybe one day I can come visit. Do you know who Santa is? He is so fat, and have a beard, and bring the gift. Right. On what day? Christmas! Right, okay. Teacher. You bring gift for me? The day you are brave enough to go to 9th grade English, I will bring you a milk tea. All right, listen up. Today, we are going to write a letter to Santa. -Why? -Because that's what we do in America. We write a letter to Santa asking him for what we want for Christmas. And if we're good, he will bring them gifts. Evan. Evan. I want to draw. Give me your book. You'll get your drawing back after class. Okay, write three things you want from Santa, and when you're finished, bring them to me. Teacher, I thought God give everything. -Well... -Yes, Jesus said, "Ask and he give." Good. I ask Jesus for iPhone. I don't think it works like that. You need to be careful what you ask for. I asked for a husband once and... Just finish your Christmas lists. -Thank you. -Thank you. Hi. Thank you. -Thank you. Here you go. -Thank you. Okay. Hi. Thank you. Oh, hey. Thank you. Here you go. Teacher, will Santa give me what I want? Evan... I... Earthquake! Rachel! Go! Stay, teacher.

You have such a beautiful voice. -We wish you a Merry Christmas -But too many people. -We wish you a Merry Christmas -I will be right in the front row. -And a Happy New Year -I can't play. Too scared. We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas Want me to come with you? We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year Okay. -We'll be scared together. -Okay. Okay. Rachel! Rach-- Hey! Here. Here. O holy night The stars are brightly shining It is the night Of our dear savior's birth Long lay the world In sin and error pining Till he appeared And the soul felt its worth A thrill of hope The weary world rejoices For yonder breaks A new and glorious morn Fall on your knees O hear The angel voices O night Divine O night When Christ was born O night Divine O night O night divine Good job. I show that one to Mom every day, so that she doesn't forget you. I'd be home if I could, you know. It's a paycheck, right? Yeah. Give Mom a kiss for me. Hey. You guys. Teacher, your sister, is she American? Yes. I have a picture. Yeah, that's her right there. -Oh, this one? -Yeah. -She's so beautiful. -Yeah. She's smaller? She is younger. I am older. -Yeah. -Where is your mother? She is in America too. Where is your mother? She die. I'm sorry. It's okay. She's happy now. Do you get sad? Sometimes. But Jesus say it's okay. My mom is sick, and I am scared. It's okay, teacher. It's okay. How do you guys not know what a submarine is? Look at the drawing. It's not good drawing. -Oh, okay. That's fair. -I draw it. What is it? Not a race car. Okay, forget it. Everyone just work on something quietly. And, yes, Evan, you can draw. "Ruth. A story of encouragement and hope." Benny. Oh, it's a play. Is this why you wanted to learn? It's full of English drama. I play Ruth. I play Naomi. See, Trisha, I told you, you're smart. -And you're director. -I what? Every class does English drama, and teacher directs. Li Ming never tol-- Or I'll take it. She know too much Chinese. She have Taiwan boyfriend. What? No. I do not. Sorry, teacher. They want. What was that? Parents say he no learn English. Well, yeah, all he does is draw. They take to a new school. He's leaving? Wait! This is my fault, not Evan's. Please give me another chance. I have been distracted, but I will work harder with him, I promise. See? See how well he understands? You quiet. Talk? No. Just... How does God choose parents? It's like he just plops a helpless baby into the arms of a clueless teenager and expects those babies to turn into responsible adults. He obviously made good choices with yours. You turned out all right. Sometimes I don't want to know what you're saying, but right now I do. These kids need to be loved. And I want to... love. But I am afraid if I love anything too much, God's just gonna take it all away. Don't be scary. Scared. Don't be scared. Teacher. You're with Teacher Horace? We were just getting milk tea. Chill. What's mean "chill"? Relax. Calm down. Come on, show me what you got. -Go. -Come on. "Naomi's son married Ruth, but then a famine came and there was no food. Naomi's husband and son died, so she and Ruth were alone." My husband and son are dead. Now I'm alone. I stay with you. -No, you are-- -Wait. Hold on. First, I can't hear you. You need to be louder. And why are you just standing there? Okay, Ruth and Naomi are leaving Moab. Take a lap around the stage. Like, run. Circle. Thank you. I don't want look stupid. You won't. And, Calvin, you can't bring your script on-stage the night. Other classes do. They just stand there, reading from their scripts? Now, that is stupid. Come on, you guys. Don't you wanna blow them away? What's mean "blow away"? Like what you and Rachel did at the Christmas show. Be so good that you surprise everyone. Oh, yes. I dance? No sexy dancing this time, okay? Come on, everyone. Let's do this. Come on. We are going to have so much fun, we what? -Blow them away! -Blow them away! -Hey. -Hi. It's been a minute. Yeah, been really busy. I bet.

I'll catch you later, okay? Bye. So Horace and I will be in the front row cheering you on. So pretty. Look, teacher, everyone there. I scared. Oh, it's okay to be scared. Rachel, help Calvin. How did we do it at Christmas? -We go be scared together. -Yeah. Okay, everyone, break a leg. It just means "do a really good job." And if you do, I will make you a deal. Okay, what's deal? If you do a really good job tonight, I will buy all of you boba nai cha. -Yes! -Okay? Have fun. Yeah. "Naomi's son married Ruth, but then a famine came and there was no food. Naomi's husband and son died, so she and Ruth were alone." My husband and son are dead, now I'm alone. I stay with you. No, you are young. You'll find someone else. No, I stay with you. You are my family now, okay? "So Ruth left her home and went with Naomi to Bethlehem, where Boaz lived. Boaz had a big farm, ad Ruth went to work in the fields, so she and Naomi had food." Whoa, dude, look! She's so beautiful. Will you chill? -What's means "chill"? -Calm down, bro. He's so handsome. And you need a husband. I worked so hard. I'm so tired. I sleep. Wait, wait, wait. Here, please. Good night. Look, he is asleep. I make you a deal. -You go sleep by his feet. -What? Yes, then he will know you love him. Go. -Okay. -Break a leg. God give me a wife. I am blown away. "So Ruth married Boaz. And they lived happily ever after." It was so good. Better than I could imagine. -Thank you. -Okay. So good. They did so well tonight, don't you think? Are you okay? This my story. Ruth? My home... far from here. Rachel, same village. Father's Day, whole village celebrate. I was get married. I go to Taipei for a ring. I told my father... back for party. Only few survived. How did you...? After everything... After? I angry. Like you. Am I? I guess I am. I'm angry and hurt over very small things compared to... It is okay. It's okay to feel, Kelsey. There a time for everything. Now God give me family. Kelsey. Your sister. I-- I think emergency. Hello? Liz? They said Mom only has a few days. I don't know what to do, Kels. Liz, I'm coming home. Thank you. Teacher. Oh, guys. Oh, thank you. Hey, Mama. It's Kelsey. Liz? Go away. The options have expanded. Yeah. They have. We can't eat all that before... Leap of faith. What's his name? Harold? Horace. Who gave him that name? No idea. Probably a Canadian. I told Mom about him. -When? -When you weren't talking to me. I can't believe you told Mom before you told me. I bet she loved that. A foreign romance. A love with no language. Do you? Love him? To everything, there is a season. A time to be born and a time to die. I hope it's okay I came. It's fine. She was always good to me. She loved you. Kels, look, I'm sorry. All right? I messed up. I made a terrible mistake. -I thought God told you-- -No. I... I was scared. But, hey, I'm not-- I'm not scared anymore. I'm ready. I love you. Kels, I've always loved you. What about Ashlyn? It didn't work out. Oh, no, Braden. It worked out perfectly. -Hi. -Teacher! -You stay. -Yes, I stay. I made you a deal, didn't I? -Where is Calvin? -Oh, he went back to 9th-grade English. -Go tell him to come get his milk tea. -Okay. Where is your sister? She is coming in a week. Hi. Kiss. Kiss! Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. And now you may kiss the bride.
