Like the waters of our Dniepr river, clear and transparent is the art of Natalya Ushviy. The great October revolution opens, for the daughter of a poor farmer, the doors to the splendid world of art. The enthusiastic art of the famous Ukrainian actress is loved by Soviet audiences and is well known outside of our land. That which was for many of us already History, was for the young Natalya Ushviy already life. During the great civil war, thousands of valiant sons and daughters of the people because creators of a new socialist culture. From the box of the Kiev Theatre dedicated to Taras Shevchenko, the passionate poetry of the great actress exhorts the revolutionaries to new victories. Listen! And then tell our children so they will know and pass it on to their children, with what harshness the Cossacks have punished the Poles, guilty of not being able to govern well. In designing the image of the heroic mother for the monument to the great poet Kharkov the sculptor was inspired by the features of the great actress. Let there be such a son and such a mother and such people on the Earth. In the film of the life of Taras Shevchenko, Natalya Ushviy played the sister of the poet. I tell you that you must provide! Take it, have pity, take it. You have money? Not even a penny. I swear in Christ's name. Begone! - Don't ruin me. I beg of you! - Begone now! Good Sir... Irina! Don't you recognise me? My sister... Taras! My brother! The bleeding heart of a simple woman, exploited by the bosses in the world of spectacle. STOLEN HAPPINESS with Natalya Ushviy and Amvrosi Buchma in the lead roles Anna... Anna... That policeman... That Mikhail... What do you want with him? I know as a girl you were in love with him and you know it too. And so what? Nothing. But why cry? Why break my heart? Because mine is in pieces. Anna... But don't... Don't you love me even a bit? No. Have you never loved me? No! Couldn't you at least make an effort to live with me as before? Oh, no... I'm lost. Lord, Thy will be done. Lord, why have you punished me so. What have I done to you? Don't blame me. You know it's not my fault. You know very well, they forced me to marry you. Until they used force... I was a faithful wife. Even if I didn't love you. But now... I don't have the strength. Yes, look, I... I understand you... I... The unhappy destiny of Anna is inspired by the tragic events in the life of the protagonist of the film EARTH based on a story by Olga Kobylyanskaya. Earth! Our people call it Mother. But then it had become a wicked stepmother and because of it, many died, in sweat and in blood. For a piece of land, one would kill even one's brothers. Mikhail! Good people! He is dead! Mikhail! Arise! Don't bother! Get up! What are you saying father, Maria is innocent. Don't you see, her son is coming. Don't you dare take him from me. Who has said it? Who? That a brother forgets his own brother is the blackest of lies. It can't be. A cursed hand has killed one of them, and now it wants to kill the other. The VYBORG SIDE The profoundly realistic acting of Natalya Ushviy has conquered the hearts of millions. Here she is, the washerwoman. Dear Dunechka, Rejoice. We are taking part in a great event. - What is it? - Read. Drink! Drink! Tell me what I must do... where I must go... and if you tell me the truth - I'll go wherever you want. - Be quiet! Your number is 16. They'll call it. Drink! Let's toast the health of those who wish to live as heroes. Get back! In the name of the Soviet, get back! Judas! Throw it away! No, you can't take it! Why? Why? To the wife of a soldier Evdokia, life suggests a clear objective to be pursued. My head is burning! People, have pity. Don't deceive me. I've been deceived all my life. You! What did you say? Say it here! Say it in front of everyone. I have stolen... I cursed the Soviet power but it has forgiven me. When ever... When ever have we seen such a thing You have railed against Lenin, but Lenin has given me... a house. The unforgettable images of the heroes of the Second World War... Polina Kostiuk protagonist of Vanda Vassileskaya's The Rainbow. From the pages of the book she enters the screen and from the screen, she comes to life. With a firm step she crossed country after country. Infusing courage and instilling hate for the bloodthirsty fascism. The images of Polina Kostiuk became a real help to the heroes at the front. After having seen this film, the Soviet fighters wrote: I promise you we will fight the enemy! So that no fascists will leave our land alive! Our Ukraine will again be free! Letters were sent... to Polina Kostiuk These touching letters were very dear to Natalya Mikhailovna Often she received them when she was already at the front. In memory of a show by Natalya Ushviy for soldiers at the front a soldier gave to the museum this model. In the art of Natalya Ushviy work on the profound revelation of the person portrayed draws attention to every artistic detail. The History Museum Here each artist hears the voice of ancient history. 300 years ago. In 'The Fire of Anger' she plays the wife of Bohdan Khmelnytsky symbol of power of the Ukrainian hetman. Black clouds gather over the Ukraine I won't leave the mace. Get out, fools! The wife of Bohdan is here. Listen, Ukraine is seething. It's fury is raised. It will never burn! Here it is. The sacred mace. Take it to the free Cossacks of Zaporoshye that they care for it like the apple of their eye. But the greatest joy for the actress is to play contemporary heroines. THE VIBURNUM GROVE Natalka Kovshak doesn't give a moment's peace to Romaniuk played by Yuri Shumsky. Come here - Mummy - Don't bother me! Come here, before I burst with rage! - Tell her! - Why don't you. Tell me. I want to know right now. Who are Yavdokha Mironenko and Maria Bereza? Tell me! Where did their husbands fall and where are they buried. And where were you? Hiding in the river grass, whilst the Red Army fought! Me, here... Here is the map... Go straight away in the direction of the kolkhoz. Then we'll talk about it, calmly. Beaurocrats! Without me! Good day! - Nikola, why are you so smug? - I'm unwell. Mum, let me introduce Comrade Verbach, the painter. Pleased to meet you. Comrade Verbach will stay with us, to paint. On the contrary. I won't stay with you. Why not? Perhaps my house is too small or my cooking isn't good enough. But I need peace and quiet, not all this carry on. What carry on? Come, Comrade painter, stay with us. With us, it will be fine. Don't listen to the beaurocrats... Don't listen... Blast! - I've forgotten the word. - What word? That which the sailors and secretaries used yesterday at the assembly. I don't remember. That's it... Opportunists! Opportunists! Natalka, I must bring you to the party, to explain two things. Don't be offended. We are just a couple of gossips. And everyone loves a gossip!

Love for the heroic daily life of soviet man, has allowed her to create the most convincing and artistically excellent roles. Her wide repertoire covers the most diverse of roles. She has portrayed the ruthless greed of Marina Mnishek in Boris Godunov. Get up! What do you think, imposter? To be able to conquer, by prostrating yourself, the vulnerable heart of a sweet, young girl? You're mistaken!

You're a sailor. The revolution awaits you. Get up! Even that, would rest a bit... if it was as tired, as I am. How can... you rest, revolution... if you, his sailor sleeps, and is not on guard. With much compassion the actress tells of the destiny of Yulia... in a drama written by Ostrovsky But... But how... Mikheevna! The shrew Beatrice, in Shakespeare's comedy... Has the master returned from the war? Sharing the suffering of Marusia, protagonist of another play Little birds, take to him my news, Tell him of my home sickness, of my distress. Home sickness has overcome me, even unto death. With her Filomena Merturano, Ushviy protests strongly against the hypocrisy of bourgeois society. My children! For 25 years, I've thought only of my children... I've raised you... Seen you grow into adulthood... She has conferred her profoundly tragic tones to Gorky's Sofia. My God!
