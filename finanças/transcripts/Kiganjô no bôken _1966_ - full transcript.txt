Starting at 70 silver coins, 70 silver! Only 70! Take a look at this white skin. Take her to the city of Xi'an and she'll be much in demand. 80 silver. 90 silver! 100 silver! 100 silver! We've got an offer for 100 silver. Anyone else? 100 silver. 100 gold! What? 100 gold! Just like the market of an international city Tung Huan. We've got 100 gold. It's a bargain to buy rejuvenation for a mere 100 gold coins. Alright, next! Now go on. What a difference there can be between two human beings! Hurry and get off. There's no need to be scared! This one's a bit creepy but he's got muscles. Tranquilize him a bit and he'll handle a workload for 10 men. Think of it as buying an ox that speaks. What do you say? Now, how much? Wait a moment. Will this be enough? You want to take him? This is more than enough. I'd even offer you a 'thank you' gift, but I can't. He eats just much as any man, or any horse really. Please give me the keys to the chains. Right away. Judging from your hair style, you're Japanese, aren't you? Why don't you return to the capital of Xi'an right now? Many Japanese students live there. They wouldn't mind helping you out. With a body like yours, you can earn your way back to Japan one day. You've got parents and brothers and sisters, right? Go back to them as soon as you can. Hey, what are you going to do now? Don't be concerned. You've got some kind of past, too, haven't you? Otherwise, why a Japanese monk would come all the way out here? I'm a scholar monk who came here with Japanese diplomats to Tong (China). My name is Ensai from Horyuji temple in Yamato. I left Xi'an with my two fellow monks in search of Buddha's relics... but on our way, one of them got lost and the other fell ill. Do you want these Buddha relics bad enough to risk your life? It's not that I want it, but Japan as a nation needs it. Is that so. Since you've been here, you've felt enough how behind Japan still is. No comparison in terms of academics or Buddhism. Our hope is to build a decent capital in Japan... and raise a large temple there as soon as we can. But alas, we don't have Buddha's relics. Can't you build a temple without the relics? Do you know what Buddha's relics are? I don't. They're the remains of our Holy Buddha. It's indispensable for a temple to carry... a thing more important than the main icon. I'll work and pay you back the money you gave me. Money? Oh, that's not necessary. I simply couldn't walk by, seeing a fellow Japanese being traded as a slave. For that, I spent the money I was going to buy a camel with... but I have these two legs of mine. I'm sure I'll manage. TAKLAMAKAN DESERT This is the far western end of China... where the green rows of mountains finally begin to turn into the red desert. Ensai Soh took the southern most route from the ancient city of Tung Huang... which now we know as the Silk Road. The word, the Silk Road, reminds us of "The Travels of Marco Polo"... and the Monkey King from "Journey to the West". SALT DESERT Even then, there were dead cities and castles half-buried in the sands. The sole means of transportation in the desert were caravans with camels. When did the road that connects Asia and Europe begin to develop? They say Mediterranean women adored silk from China... but what was transported from the West to the East? It was Buddhism that traveled this road to China, then to Japan. Guess the next caravan will pick him up. He's not gonna make it. Hm. Nothing we can do. Well, shall we go? Poor fellow. He'll be eaten up by the wolves. Please forgive us. Please don't mind me and go on. Hurry. Oh, it's you! Hey. Say, will you carry that man on your camel? You're kidding. What about my baggage? You're a strange man. You won't tell me why you're coming with me. You won't tell me your name. Is that so. To be honest, you seem very weird to me. Is that so. I'll ask you again... why don't you think it over? Is that so. The caravan will turn back once they finish their trades in the town of Pesil... but I intend to go as far as India via Gandhara to obtain Buddha's relics. I don't know how many years it'll take me or even if I'll make it home alive. Is that so. All you say is "Is that so" to whatever I ask. Alright! Your name from now on is Is-that-so! Alright, Is-that-so? Is that so? Is-that-so! Is-that-so! Is-that-so! Move on! We'll travel as far as we can. From here on, we'll be avoiding the heat by traveling at night! Hey, there's a tornado! Over there! What? That's nothing. There are demons and ghosts that appear that can lead us astray. Never separate from the caravan! You may think I'm crazy... but in my long years of being a guide... I've witnessed many strange things. Understood? What's the matter? What's that? Wait! Do you wanna die? We shouldn't move. We've got to stay in one place and be still now. If you scatter, that's the end of you! Wait until the ghost flames go away. Ghost flames? That's the souls of the dead calling to the living. Wait! You'll lose your life! It's my life! Hey! Hey! - Is-that-so! - Wait! - Is-that-so! - Don't go! You'll die! Get down! Down! Is-that-so! Don't move! Attack! Get up! They're human! Get the camels to sit in a circle formation! We'll get inside! - Wait! - If we stall, we'll all be killed! To the right! To the right! Go on! Go on! Get down! Get down! Get down low! Get down! Get down! Come on, move it now! They might come back for us again! We've gotta at least hide ourselves. Follow me! Hey, hurry up. Hurry! Hurry up! Come on, hurry and hide ourselves! Someone's made a fire here. Has anyone got a lighter? I've got one. This is a temple! No, it's not. This is a tomb of an ancient king. Tomb? If we mess with a tomb, we'll be cursed. Leave if you don't like it. Death waits outside. It's certainly a temple. These are images of Bodhisattvas. There must be Buddha's relics if it's a temple. You wanna go further in? It'll be a find if you can get it here. It isn't so easy to find Buddha's relics. Is that so. Looks like someone lives here, doesn't it? You shouldn't go in! This tomb is hundreds of years old. No, this rock is a Mesa. Mesa? In the desert you sometimes see the tips of rocks... that are deeply rooted in earth, which we call Mesa. Ancient kings made their tombs in the Mesa... Gotten themselves mummified to rest in peace. But some temples are also carved in large rocks. We'll know if we look inside. Don't do it! I said don't do it! What if we get cursed? The two of us will carry the curse. Bastard! Let's do this tomorrow. They're gone. It's a stoopa! What's a, um, stoopa? We call it a pagoda in China and Japan. A five-tiered pagoda is also a type of stoopa. I hear Buddha's relics are always buried underneath it. Give it to me! Please stop it. That's disrespectful. Outta the way! These are the relics. What I've long been looking for for so long... My hardships have now been rewarded. Your hardships are just beginning, now that everyone else has left. All the rivers around here flow from Mt. Konron and get absorbed into the desert. Now, the question is have they gone up or down the river? I told you it doesn't matter. Now that we've got this... I want to deliver this to the city of Kotan as soon as possible. The only thing that matters is to get this to Kotan. Is that so. Then, you're on your own. It's two days on a speedy horse to Kotan... ...and 10 days on foot. How are you gonna travel with 2 days' supply of water? Where's the next oasis? That's why I said to go up this river! It's been 2 years since I left home. Five years for me! My mission is complete. All I need to do is deliver this to Yoshio, a Japanese student, in Kotan. What? What did you say? I said to deliver this to Kotan. That's not what I asked! The name of the student! What's his name? He's from Aoto, Hizen. His name is Yoshio. Yoshio from Aoto? Do you know him? - He's my younger brother. - What? Then, you're the boatman. Your name is Osumi if I recall. I see. Since they heard your boat carrying Japanese diplomats to Tong sank... people in Japan think you're dead. Doesn't matter. Are you sure the name of this student in Kotan is Yoshio? Your brother Yoshio wanted to find you... so he worked hard to become a visiting student... and finally fulfilled his dream of making it here the end of last year. But somehow... he seems to have given up on finding you. He's getting ready to return to Japan as soon as he receives these relics Now, first thing's first. Let's get to Pesil as soon as we can... then get a horse or camel and hurry on to Kotan. Yes. Are those foxes trying to trick us? The water springs up abundantly and there are trees and plants. How come there's no town forming around such a perfect oasis? 'Cause the caravans don't pass by. How come the caravans don't pass by? This is far better than that desert path. 'Cause it's out of their way, I guess. That's not all. 'Cause there's something like me around here. By the way, haven't you seen two young women somewhere? Both beautiful. Oh no, you don't have to be alarmed. While waiting here to help them... I soaked in the cool water and ended up dosing off. You were sleeping in the water? Yeah, I can sleep deeply when the blood in my body cools down. How on earth do you breathe? You've got a problem if I breathe in the water? It's like snakes and frogs hibernating. Abandoning all the worldly thoughts... Anyway, haven't you seen the two women by any chance? We have, at the ruins over that way. At the ruins? About what time? About 2 hours ago. Oh, rats! We'll see each other if fate allows. TOWN OF PESIL Hurry up! Hurry up! What the heck is this? A clock tower, isn't it? Can you tell me... Excuse me, do you know of an inn for travelers nearby? What's wrong with them? What a weird town! It is strange. Shit! Stop it! Stop it, will you? Welcome! If you've got money, I can get you a camel or donkey right away. So stock up as much food and water as you can and get out of here real quick! Well, first, bring us some drink and food. If you drink, you won't feel like walking. When you go outside of town... follow the river all the way downstream. That'll bring us back to the desert. That's right. You'll be safer in the desert. What the heck are you talking about? Your company got caught in this place and were all taken to the castle. If you don't hurry, you may get stuck in this town forever. Company... You mean the Uighur merchants we traveled with part of our way? You stay out of it! I want you out of here! Hey, get out of here now! Hey, everyone! The queen's been captured! They lock her to the cart as if she's a criminal. They're coming this way. Don't go outside! Stay inside if you don't wanna die! Is it forbidden to watch a procession in this country? They always blame you for nothing or no reason and take you away. Get inside! Hey, stay inside! They'll only give you hell. Come inside! Come inside! Come back in. Don't act foolishly. Shut up. I'm just watching. You can watch from inside. That's called petty braveness. It's not real courage at all. Now come inside. Come inside! Osumi! Osumi! Hey, out of the way! Why are you standing there? Can't one watch what passes by in the street in this country? What, you bastard! Shit! What are they gonna do with the queen? - Kill her, I guess. - Who will? Who do you think? The king. Why would he do that? The king is a mistrustful man. He claims every man carries an evil intention... and has people arrested without a reason and then killed. First it was his uncle. Then his blood brother. Along with him went the compassionate chancellor, Sir Tajaka. And now his own Queen. When we were kids, he was such a good, kind king. Sounds like something's going on. Actually, he was betrayed... by his relatives a few times, and his life was threatened. And since then, it seems he cannot trust anybody but himself. He's turned into a completely different person. Different like water and fire, heaven and earth. Your company, too... was arrested as foreign spies disguised as a caravan. They mentioned there were two more men... A monk and his assistant, and I'm sure they meant you. There's been an order to report you to him as soon as we find you. Osumi, where are you going? Alright, in that case I'll report to the castle myself. What? I can't let such a foolish king just be. I'm gonna talk some sense into him. What's so funny? What right do you have to laugh at what he's doing? You can't do anything that takes courage! But Osumi, you and I have important business in Kotan. Let's not waste any more time here and depart as soon as possible. Be quiet, monk. You wait here. Hey, show me to the castle. Me? You don't have to take me inside. Show me as far as to the gate. Let me show you the way! Osumi! Hey, this way! Wait! If you run, I'll arrest and severely punish them. Will you let me see the king if I let you take me? The king? What business have you got with the king? I've got something to talk to him about. You think he'll see a traveler who looks like a beggar? Idiot! Run away and leave everyone to die, if you want. - Dammit! - Quick, run! Hurry and run! Your brother awaits... Move! Osumi! Your second escape attempt failed. Everybody leave. Do you hate me that much? I'm scared. How come? I don't know when you might become suspicious of me. I've never been suspicious of you. But you abandoned me twice, so I should have been cautious before. To you, your own country is more important than this country, this castle... ...or even me! Am I not right? You abandoned me and the castle... which means you abandoned your position as the queen. Did you not? What a serious face you're making! Now we know. You're a queen of the county of Kiorok and not the queen of Pesil! The problem is, Kiorok is after our country's oasis with lush vegetation. Perhaps when they sent you to me, they already had a scheme. The Uighur caravan caught today... aren't they the spies from your country, too? - That can't... - No, you don't have to answer. I more or less know your plot. I'd love to send you back to your home country... but you know the structure of this castle too well. I tried to escape twice. I'm prepared to be executed. No, I can't let you die so easily. I'll hold you hostage in this castle for the rest of your life. So, how'd it go? The time has come for you to become the queen. Shut up!! If you hadn't showed up in our town, this would've never happened, right? That's right. I hate your attitude... Thinking it's alright to get others in trouble as long as you're safe. That's right! We got into trouble because of you! That's right! Where's that bastard and what's he doing now? Granny! We're taking some! Yeah. Say hello to the Black General. Yeah! Hey, where are you? Unbelievable. Hey! Where the hell did he go? Come. If you're there, say something to let me know, will you? Hey, I've got a horse for you. You'd better leave while your head and body are still connected. Before I go to Kotan, I'll go to the castle and meet the king. What nonsense are you talking? Which is more important, your friend or your own life? You're lucky to have been the one to escape. So what kind of a fool are you to give in yourself and get arrested? Now, stop talking nonsense. All you need now is water... Doesn't look like you can drink this water. This is Hell Pond! Hell Pond? You can't drink this water. - It's burning water. - Burning water? Come on, run! We can't stay around here... I am the guardian of the burning water of this pond... ...requested by a certain general. General? That's right. The general who controls the entire army of soldiers at the castle. He likes things that are black like the water of this pond. That's why he makes his men wear that kind of a costume, isn't it? I mean those two who came to get the water. Looks like you know a bit too much. You don't seem to know how powerful I am. You must be a foreigner, I suppose? Why should I be afraid of a wrinkled-up granny? Granny! He doesn't know who you are. Forgive him! No need to plead for forgiveness. You disturbed the hills you weren't supposed to... ...and saw the Hell Pond you weren't supposed to. You do whatever you like. And I do whatever I like. Granny! Help me! Damn you, Granny! Are you a witch? Aren't you afraid of me, who has lived on Mt. Konron for 300 years? There's no use. The flame will burn its way up there eventually. Help me! Hey, help me! Shall we experiment if your head would reconnect to your body? It's you again, you nosey old bastard! You're beating up on the helpless again. That's a bad habit. Don't be stupid! They're trying to sneak into the castle. So what? Anything you don't want them to know about? None of your old behind's business! It's alright now. There's also someone I'm concerned about in the castle. You mean you're concerned about the queen. This senile old man has the nerve to fancy the queen... and indulges himself in dirty thoughts. You're a fool. You can't interpret everything to be ugly like that. Mine is platonic love. I just want to save the beautiful queen from the king's grip. Liar! In your old age... You've fallen for the queen, who could be your granddaughter. Shut up! We may have to become enemies one day. Fine. I know I'm gonna have to settle my accounts with you some day. But for now, I shall leave. Aaghh! Granny, what a mean thing to do! Can't you use magic, old man? Idiot! You think a wizard would fall in such an embarrassing way? Can't you tell by the way I look? I'm a hermit! You! How long are you going to be stuck up there? You're a local, aren't you? Being a local, you know Granny guards Hell Pond... and she'd kill you if you come near it, don't you? Well, I've heard of Hell Pond but I didn't know what it was. The burning water is irrigated to the inner moat. So, if anything happens, they can set the inner moat on fire. The king can't even trust his own men. He built the moat around the castle wall... and lives all alone at the top of the stone tower beyond it. Poor man. Poor? The king? You! You can't come in here! Don't you hear me? Is it true I'd get a reward... if I knew the whereabouts of the Uighur who escaped? You know where he is? Yeah. Let me see someone in charge. Okay. Wait here. Yes, yes. Hey! There's nobody here, you moron! But, well... Have you seen anyone suspicious? No, sir. Alright, light up the torches! Yes sir! You don't know where the king is? No. Also, I know he's cruel but I can't hate him. I see. No matter what kind of a tyrant he is, he's still your man. Now, run to a safe place. I'd thought of asking you for help... but you couldn't do anything by yourself. The Uighur merchants and a monk are trapped here. Where are they? You think the Queen would know such a thing? I'm on your side. That's why we're telling you to run away. Alright, then. Leave from where you came in. There's a guard in the hallway. He snuck inside the castle! Let's go! How dare you disturb us! Crazy man! Arrest him! Quick! Arrest him! You got yourself into a trap. This is the only way out. Come on! Let go! Stop it! It's me! Wait! Go around! Who are you? Where's the king? Is there anyone respectable enough to make a queen? Surely! At the top of the list is Ms. Spuria, Sir Chancellor's daughter. Young and beautiful, both her blood line and her personality are... Oh, Ms. Spuria! Be quiet. You don't expect to get out of here alive, do you? What made you want to risk your own life to enter the castle? It's one thing to be a tyrant... but what a shame the nation's king is a thief! And not just an ordinary thief... but one that terrorizes the road that connects the East and the West... going after treasures of the world! Your words don't make any sense to me. Who on earth are you? I'm with the Uighur caravan. We're not any spies for any country. You arrest innocent people to hide your own illegal activities, don't you? Arrest him! Hold it. I heard your caravan was going to Kotan for business. So how come you're making a detour passing through this country? Our men were killed by bandits, and we lost all our water and food! That isn't a very clever lie. Listen well. There's never been any bandit attacks on that desert road. That's because there's no way of getting drinking water on that route. Then let me ask you something, what if this castle were the bandits' nest? There's no shortage of water of food here... and they can attack as many caravans as they want. Let me handle this guy alone, you can leave. No, we can't! You never know what kind of nonsense he might come up with! Is there anything he might say that's inconvenient for you? No, no, what we're concerned about is... Enough! I feel like talking to someone different than your once in a while. Go on, leave us. Now we're talking. Now let's get down to business. You do seem to be brave. What country sent you? You're such a mistrustful king. I'm safe and sound right now because I've learned not to trust. I was once a trusting king. If you sat in this chair, you'd really see how greedy people can be. You never know what they'd say or do to help themselves. Because of a tyrant like you, no one laughs in this town. They can't even talk out loud. You're mistrustful because your heart is malicious. You can talk all you want... but when you're about to burn on the stake... you'll be pleading for your life to a tyrant. I wouldn't be saying what I say if I weren't prepared to die. Because you aren't yet on the stake. I'd never plead for my life. You think so? Then you'll be on the stake at noon tomorrow. Then you'll know what your heart is truly made of. People don't even know what their own hearts are like. Let me know if you decide you want your life spared. Osumi! What on earth did you say to the king? What was it? Osumi? Stupid king! What happened? Tell me what happened? Osumi? No one in your group has even been sentenced. I wonder why you alone are getting the stake. Shut up! Dammit! So he was a bad person after all. I was so worried about what was going to come out of it... ...but fortunately for us, the king has sentenced him to the stake. Well, we can't relax too soon. A man on the stake with a big crowd watching... may blurt out some big words in desperation. Never know what words he might say. In that case, shall we poison his breakfast? No, no, it's not a good idea to kill him in prison. The king is a suspicious man already. Oh, it's Granny. Granny, you got a good plan? That man you're having difficulties with... Shall I take him to Hell Pond and burn him? So that no trace of him, not even a strand of his hair will remain. Hello, hello, wake up. Hello, wake up! Wake up, will you? Please wake up. Wake up. Hey, wake up. You can't fool me. Come out, old man! Even if heaven and earth are torn asunder... that man will not wake up until the sun is up. You did that to him, didn't you? Sort of. Are you gonna get in my way again? Granny, you're old, but you can look so beautiful with magic. I was quite charmed. Really. Was I that beautiful? Yeah, you truly were. It made my heart beat faster. You can't trick me with sweet talk. I just have a soft spot for the queen. Granny, will you turn into her for me just one more time? I rarely get to see the real queen. You dirty old man! Is this what you want? Oh, no! It's the real guard. Excuse me. See you. I... I... I'm in trouble. Guard! Guard! Open the door! Open the door! Be quiet! I wanna see the king. He said to ask him any time if I wanted anything! Life seems more dear to you after a night's sleep. Osumi! Osumi! Is it true they're burning you on the stake? Osumi! How come you're getting the stake alone? Listen, don't be defiant. Plead for your life, alright? Wait, please. Please listen. I'm a servant of Buddha. I never engage myself in violence. Please let me see the king with this man. I beg you. Where are the Buddha's relics? Right here. When you plead with the king, bow your head, okay? Your life is irreplaceable! As the Chancellor of this country, let me tell you one thing that... I would listen to you. You're the head of the bandits. Be quiet! Are you gonna let me see the king or not? - Well, right now the king is... - Follow me! Spuria! Spuria, what are you doing? I'm the only one allowed to show you to the inner castle. Really? Why are you the only one? I'm going to be the queen. I see. You irrigate the burning water from Hell Pond. Who told you? Doesn't feel safe unless he made a castle within his castle. The poor king. Aren't you the poor one burning on the stake? You're allowed in here only 'cause you're going to die anyway. Aren't you the poor one becoming his queen? It's like a death sentence to be the queen in this country, isn't it? Shut up! Or do you think you can control the king with that fine body of yours? I said shut up! You sound pretty good. Excuse me. Miss Spuria brought the criminal. - Let them in. - Yes sir. King, guess what these men said... Spuria, you can go now. Am I in your way? I'll call you when I need you. You have a favor to ask of me, I heard. Yes. I would grant your wish... if you kowtow. Even a man like you would kneel when he wants his life spared, I see. I'm not pleading for my life. What? I want three more days before I go on the stake. I said I could release you right now if you pleaded. I'm not pleading for my life. I got one thing I wanna get done before I die. What are you scheming? I want to deliver the Buddha's relics this man is carrying to Kotan. Kotan? What is it to deliver Buddha's relics to Kotan? I need to get these relics to Japan safely at any cost... so that we can spread the word of Buddha over there. Fortunately, this man's brother lives in Kotan. If I can get these to him, they'll make it to Japan in his safe hands. I didn't say I was putting you on the stake. Why don't you deliver them yourself? I don't mean to contradict you, sir... but outside of the castle, there are bandits who attack us. Osumi has a stronger body and he knows how to wield a sword. He's the only man who can deliver Buddha's relics safely. I'm sure he can make it to Kotan and back in three days. He will return, I assure you. Alright. I'll respect your beautiful friendship and set you free for three days. On one condition, though. Since I'll set you free for three days, I'll need someone to take your place. Take my place? - That's right. - I will do it. I envy your friendship. Alright. If you don't return in three days... the substitute will go on the stake, understood? Why are you looking like that? You were trying to trick me after all, weren't you? Don't be stupid! Then you agree, don't you? It's been decided. Now, haven't you got the better part? If you go back to Japan with the relics, you'll get all the credit for yourself. And if you don't make it back here in time, you'll only walk as a free man. On the other hand, you put your trust in your friend and put your life at risk. Alright, I like it. I accept your request. The deadline is noon, 3 days from now. The substitute will die even if you're a little late. Of the criminal who was scheduled to burn on the stake today... by the grace of our compassionate king, the execution has been postponed... for 3 days as been requested by the criminal himself... and the criminal will have freedom of activities. - However... - Compassionate, my ass! The criminal will have freedom of activities. However... if he breaks he does not return by noontime three days from now... ...his substitute shall be executed on the stake in this town square. You call that compassionate? You know what to do. Alright. Now go! Hey! Hey, be careful, they're after your life! That's him! Arrest him! Outta the way! Outta the way! Out of the way, bastard! Old man! All these people are on my side. What'cha going to do? Why don't you leave him alone already? I won't meddle with his business myself. Oh, you're exceptionally submissive today, aren't you? You're safe now. They'll never suspect you came up the mountain. Here, take this horse. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank the townspeople when you return. Hey! Wait! He scared me for a second. You got away at last. Be careful. A bunch of baddies are following you. Don't depend on anyone else at all. I won't help you a bit this time around. Returning will be more dangerous than going. If you every lose your way, look for the kite up there. Mr. Osumi of Yamato, a messenger from Japan. Hard work traveling such a long way. Yes, sir. Visitor from Japan, these are the genuine relics of Buddha. In Japan, do people slap their knees like that to express joy? Yes. We learned your brother happens to be here by lucky chance. - We've brought him here. - Yes. Fortunately, there's a caravan departing here for Xi'an in a couple of days. Be sure to give your brother the relics so that he can bring them to Xi'an and... hand them to the Japanese diplomats. All right? Yes, sir. You must want to see your brother as soon as possible. Go. At last, the time has come for the way of Buddha... to thrive in the far away land of Japan. What a joyous occasion! Understood? Don't let go of it even while you sleep. Brother, let's go back to Japan together. Why can't you come? Is there a reason why you can't? What do you think would happen if that man returns? The king might begin to trust people again. That's the problem. We've got to keep the king as mistrustful and cruel to the end. Don't be concerned. Lately, townsfolks have already given up on the king... and hope that you'll take over. That's only if that man doesn't return! Everybody, get over here. Guess who that is. He's already left Kotan and is on his way here. What's the matter? What happened? Camels.. My camels were stolen. What? It's the Black Bandits. Black Bandits? Where did they attack you? Here? Water... ...give me water... water... Retreat! Retreat! He's lost his horse! Retreat, retreat! What's the matter? You'd better hurry or you won't make it. Damn it! Keep running! We'll see you to the town! Damn! Hey, you shouldn't have returned! I can't let you rest yet, not until you pay me back. Get up! On your feet! Now go on, dig a hole! A hole deep enough for bury you up to your head. Hurry up! Boss, let's just kill him. Do you wanna let him rest that easily? No need to rush. We know where he's going. Let's go now! Do you know this is Hell Valley? No one's ever come back from there alive. Ignorance sure is bliss. Did you do it? I chased him down into Hell Valley. Did you have Granny's help as usual? Try and climb up here if you can. What are you scheming? Burn! Burn! Until nothing remains of him! It's the day of the promise. He should return by noon. I see. I envy your ability to trust in a man so much. If he returns as he promised, I'll rethink my thoughts about mankind. Yes sir. Although it's an arrangement, it's not good to have killed a servant to Buddha. If you admit man is not to be elied upon after all... then I won't put you on the stake. What do you say? This is your last chance. Think thoroughly before you answer me. Then, I have a request. What is it? I ask you to release him when he returns. Take him. Now, shall I go? I didn't do anything. I didn't give him a hand. Better wake up or you'll be late. What do you say? You've learned what man can be like, haven't you? If he hasn't returned, there must be a good reason. That's right. The good reason is that he doesn't want to die. No. Some obstacle must have prevented him from returning. Obstacle? I'm sure you know what it is. Shut up! Who do you think I am? It's an insult to accuse me like that. You just blew your chance for pardon with that one remark. Look at the shadow of the stake. When the shadow overlaps the marking, it's noon and the deadline. Blame yourself for trusting in man. Come closer. Close the castle gate at once and don't let anyone pass, even if it's the king! Yes, sir! It's time. I know. I don't wish to see it. The agreement is for you to be on this platform. It's past the deadline. Alright, set him on fire. Everybody! Put out the fire! Quiet! Quiet! What are you doing? Quiet! Osumi... So you returned to die. You're that kind of a man. Even if you didn't return, I would have never blamed you. Osumi... Now, get off! Hey, stand up straight! Idiot, coming back to die. Out of the way! Don't touch him! Are you alright? Here is a man with a pure heart. Evil and greedy hearts exist only in the castle. Everybody, listen! I shall release him! Look! How humble, the king is on his knees! On his knees... Forgive me. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! It's a coup d'etat! Coup d'etat in the castle! Protect the king! What can the king do away from his castle? No matter how many tens of thousands of folks gather... they're just an unorganized bunch. I am the king of this castle as of today. Greetings to you all. Congratulations. Congratulations. This is my castle! You've got a problem with that? What happened? What happened? You're safe! 'Cause I'm on her side. Get him! I've been waiting for you. Hey, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna show you what'll become of the one who killed that man. Damn it! What do you think will happen if I set the burning water on fire? I'm gonna burn you and the king down along with the castle! Be prepared. Oh, what happened? Lower the bridge! You brats! What's this water? It's the old man! He turned the burning water into regular water! Show your face, old man! Lower it! I said lower it, brats! Lower it! Do as I say! Lower it! Lower it! Lower it! Osumi. This is my gift to the king. Well, it was such hard work scooping out all this water... and changing it with clean water. Thank you. I intend to keep my heart as pure and clean as this water. I can't find them anywhere! What, can't find them? They're my important guests who saved this country. Find them! Find them, at once! Yes sir! Translated by Ann Jiitsu Mastered and Subtitled by Cannibal King KuroTokagi
