? To the head bone ? The head bone's connected to the horn bone ? The horn bone's right above the wing bones ? Ah! I scared you! No, you didn't. Okay! Remember our field trip rules, everyone. Uh, no pushing, no biting, and no fire breathing! What did I just say? Eighteen, nineteen... Okay, we're missing one. Who are we missing? Oh. Mike Wazowski. Thanks, Joe. Good luck finishing your crossword puzzle. Sorry, Michael. I didn't see you. That's okay. When I was on the bus, I found a nickel! I wish I had pockets. Okay, everyone, partner up. Get your field trip buddy. Jeremy! You and me? Okay, no biggie. Hailey? No? Pairing up with Claire? Great choice. She's a good egg. Russell. Mike? Wazowski? We car-pool? - We're cousins. - Hey! Okay. Good catching up. Well, Michael, it looks like it's you and me again. Come on, Karen. We're falling behind. Please don't call me Karen. Now, stay close together. We're entering a very dangerous area. Welcome to the Scare Floor. Wow! This is where we collect the Scream Energy to power our whole world. And can anyone tell me whose job it is to go get that scream? Scarers! That's right! Now, which one of you can give me the scariest roar? Me, me, me! Oh! Sir! Right here! Little green guy, two o'clock! No, it's like this. Hey, guys, watch this one. Hey, I got a really good... Wow! Whoa. Well, hey there, kids. Are you on a tour with your school? - Yeah! - Yes. We're here to learn about Scream Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer. Well, hey, you're in luck, because I just happen to be a Scarer. I learned everything I know from my school, Monsters University. Whoa. It's the best Scaring School there is. You wish! Fear Tech's the best. Okay. You guys watch us and tell me which school's the best. All right? MU is. West coast coming only. Scarers coming O. Oops. Stop right there. Don't cross over that safety line. Human children are extremely toxic. Look at that! Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow! Look at that! It's amazing! I know! - Wow! - Excuse me. Fellas. How about we do tallest in the back? Look, he's going to do a real scare! Cool. I want to be a Scarer. Yeah. Me, too. Come on, guys. I want to see. Out of the way, Wazowski. You don't belong on a Scare Floor. Brian! Do not step over the line. Mrs. Graves, Michael went over the line. Michael! See? I told you. He's fine. Well, I thought I heard something. What? Are you okay? You could have gotten hurt! That was real dangerous, kid. I didn't even know you were in there. Wow. I didn't even know you were in there. Not bad, kid. Michael, what do you have to say for yourself? How do I become a Scarer? Monsters University! Anybody getting off? Well, everyone, I don't mean to get emotional, but everything in my life has led to this moment. Let it not be just the beginning of my dream but the beginning of all of our dreams. Gladys, promise me you'll keep auditioning. Marie, Mr. Right is out there somewhere. Phil, keep using the ointment till that thing goes away. I wish you all the best. Thank you all so much! I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off. Hello. How are you doing? Ah! Wooh-hoo! Stroke! Stroke! Come on, put all you have into it! Okay! First thing on my list, get registered. Hey there, freshman. I'm Jay the R.A., and I'm here to say that registration is that away! Okay, Jay. Have a great first day. Hey, I'm Kay! Here's your orientation packet. Thanks, Kay. You can drop your bags off here and get your picture taken with Trey. Say hooray! Hooray! I can't believe it. I'm officially a college student! Okay, everyone, I'm Fay, and I'll be giving you your orientation tour on this perfect day! Here are the labs where students learn to design and build the doors to the human world. Looks like the Professor is about to test a door! The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet, three meals a day. I personally believe we have some of the best chefs in the world. Oh! Yeah! Yeah! The campus offers a wide variety of majors, but the crown jewel of MU is the Scaring School. Welcome to the debate team. We're happy to have you. I disagree for the following reasons. True happiness is a theoretical construct... Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky at the astronomy club! Hey, hey, hey! Come join the improve club. You'll wish you were a... Never... Always... Ah, dang it! Mu's Greek Council. We sponsor the annual Scare Games. The Scare what now? The Scare Games! A super-intense Scaring competition! They're crazy dangerous, so anything could happen. A bunch of guys went to the hospital last year! You could totally die. And it's worth it. You get a chance to prove that you are the best! Cool. Wazowski, Room 319. You know, your roommate is a Scaring major, too. "Hello, I'm your roommate." Oh, that's too bland. Don't force it. Just let it happen. Your lifelong best friend is right behind this door. Hey there. I'm your roomie. Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major. Oh! Mike Wazowski, Scaring major. I can tell we're going to be best chums, Mike. Take whichever bed you want. I wanted you to have first dibs. Ahh! You just disappeared. Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class, I'll be a joke. No, it's totally great. You got to use it. Really? Yeah, but lose the glasses. They give it away. Huh. Okay! Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check. Now I just need to ace my classes, graduate with honors, and become the greatest Scarer ever. Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike. Aren't you even a little nervous? Actually, no. I've been waiting for this my whole life. I just can't wait to get started. Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day! Wow. You got to be kidding me. I'm so nervous! Relax. It will be fine. Good morning, students. Welcome to Scaring 101. I am Professor Knight. Now I'm sure all of you were the scariest monster in your town. Well, bad news, kids. You're in my town now, and I do not scare easily. Dean Hardscrabble. This is a pleasant surprise. She's a legend. She broke the all-time Scare Record with the scream in that very can! I don't mean to interrupt. I just thought I'd drop by to see the terrifying faces joining my program. Well, I'm sure my students would love to hear a few words of inspiration. Inspiration? Very well. Scariness is the true measure of a monster. If you're not scary what kind of a monster are you? It's my job to make great students greater, not make mediocre students less mediocre. That is why at the end of the semester there will be a final exam. Fail that exam and you are out of the Scaring program. So, I should hope you're all properly inspired. All right. All right. Who can tell me the properties of an effective roar? Yes? There are actually five. Those include the roar's resonance, the duration of the roar, and the... Whoops. Sorry. I heard someone say "roar," so I just kind of went for it. Oh, excuse me, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you there. Hey, how you doing? Very impressive, Mister... Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan. Sullivan. Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer? Yeah. He's my Dad. He's a Sullivan! I should have known. I expect big things from you. Well, you won't be disappointed. Uh... I'm sorry. Should I keep going? No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it. Huh. Everyone take out your Scaring textbooks and open them to chapter one. Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil? I forgot all my stuff. Ah! All right. Yes. There we go. That will get it. Mmm... Yeah. Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity and sorority party. We have to go! If we flunk that Scaring final, we are done. I'm not taking any chances. You've got the whole semester to study, but this might be our only chance to get in good with the cool kids. That's why I made these cupcakes. Oops. That could have been embarrassing. When I'm a Scarer, life will be a nonstop party. Stay out of trouble, wild man. Wild man. What the... Archie! Boo! Hey! What are you... Wait... You're shushing me? Hey! Hey! You can't... - Where did he go? - He's dead meat. That guy's in big trouble. Yeah, he is. Hey, guys! Over here! Fear Tech dummies. Oh, oh! Sorry about that, buddy. Why are you in my room? Your room? This is my... This is not my room. Archie! Come here, boy. Archie? Archie the Scare Pig. He's Fear Tech's mascot. Why is it here? I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs. The what? Roar Omega Roar. The top fraternity on campus. They only accept the highly elite. Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig. Ready? One, two, three. What? No, no... Oh! What... That's it. Don't let go. Careful. He's a biter. - Whoa! Whoa, hey... - Whoa! I got him! Uh-oh! Whoa! That was awesome! What am I doing? James P. Sullivan. Mike Wazowski. Listen, it was quite delightful meeting you and whatever that is, but if you don't mind, I have to study my Scaring. You don't need to study Scaring. You just do it. Really? I think there's a little more to it than that. But, hey, thanks for stopping by. Let go of that! My hat! My pig! Ooh! Hey! Come here! Hey! Catch it! Ooh! Yeah! Ride it to frat row! ? Tentacles and serpent's wings, they... ? Hey! Whoa... Ow! Wow! Whoa! Go, go, go! Hey... Come on! Hey! Ooh! Cupcake? Whoa... Ooh! Got it! Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules! M-U! M-U! M-U! Did you see him catch that pig? You are Jaws Theta Chi material, freshman. Oh, thanks. I don't know... No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy. Back off. We saw him first. No way. We did! I'll take it from here, gentlemen. Johnny Worthington, president of Roar Omega Roar. What's your name, big Blue? Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley. This guy's a Sullivan? Like the famous Sullivan? I can't believe it! That is crazy! Chet, calm down. I'm sorry. Sulley, any freshman with the guts to pull off a stunt like that has got "Future Scarer" written all over him. Hey, did you see me ride the pig? That took guts. Slow down, squirt. This party is for Scare students only. Oh, sorry, killer, but you might want to hang out with someone a little more your speed. Uh... They look fun! Oh, hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa? We have cake. Go crazy. Is that a joke? Sulley, talk to your friend. Oh, he's not really my friend, but sure. You heard him. This is a party for Scare students. I am a Scare student. I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance. Aw, snap! My chances are just as good as yours. You're not even in the same league with me. Just wait, hotshot. I'm going to scare circles around you this year. Oh, okay. I'd like to see that. Oh, don't worry. You will. Ready position. Common crouch. I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth. Basic snarl. Show me some slobber. Drool is a tool, kids. Use it. Now here is a monster who looks like a Scarer. You want a hope of passing this class, you better eat, breathe, and sleep Scaring. Yeah! Give me another one. Fear of spiders. Arachnophobia. Fear of thunder. Keraunophobia. Fear of chopsticks! Consecotaleophobia. What is this, kindergarten? Give me a hard one. Go Monsters U! You know what to do! The answer is C, fangs. Well done, Mr. Wazowski. A bowl of spiders! Correct! A clown running in the dark! Right again. Warts, boils, and moles, in that order. Outstanding! Ah! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ah! Ogre slump. Zombie snarl. Dominant silver back gorilla. That is some remarkable improvement, Michael. One frightening face does not a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan. A Tauntaun grimace with extra slobber. You got it! That's what I'm saying. I am going to wipe the floor with that little know-it-all. Yes, you are, big Blue. Hey, wait. What are you guys... It's just a precaution. RORs are the best Scarers on campus, Sullivan. Can't have a member getting shown up by a beach ball. Wooh-hoo! I am on a roll. I'm going to destroy that guy. Well, then you'll get this back right away. It's time to start delivering on that Sullivan name. Today's final will judge your ability to assess a child's fear and perform the appropriate Scare in the Scare Simulator. The Child Sensitivity Level will be raised from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper, so give it everything you've got. Dean Hardscrabble is with us this morning to see who will be moving on in the Scaring program and who will not. Let's get started. I am a five-year-old girl afraid of spiders and Santa Claus. Which Scare do you use? Uh... That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl. Demonstrate. Results will be posted outside my office. Next. Focus. Johnson, Crackle and Howl. Yes! Hey. Do you mind? Don't mind at all. Come on, Mike. Let's just move. Stay out of my way. Unlike you, I had to work hard to get into the Scare program. That's because you don't belong here. That's what I thought. Whoa! Whoa... I'm so sorry. It was an accident. What? This? My one souvenir from a lifetime of Scaring? Accidents happen, don't they. The important thing is no one got hurt. You're taking this remarkably well. Now, let's continue the exams. Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning. Which Scare do you use? Shouldn't I go up on the... Which Scare do you use? That is a Shadow Approach with a Crackle Holler. Demonstrate. Stop. Thank you. But I didn't get to... I've seen enough. I'm a seven-year-old boy... I wasn't finished. I don't need to know any of that stuff to scare. That "stuff" would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes. So a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course we can't have that. So I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring program. Good day. Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan. Well then, I'm sure your family will be very disappointed. And, Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught. You're not scary. You will not be continuing in the Scaring program. Please. Let me try the simulator. I'll surprise you. Surprise me? I doubt that very much. Welcome back. I hope everyone had a pleasant bre. Some say that a career as a scream-can designer is boring, unchallenging, a waste of a monster's potential. Open your textbooks to chapter three. We will now plunge into the rich history of scream-can design. Out of my way! Coming through! Oh, sorry. Ha-ha! Welcome to this year's Greek Scare Games kickoff. The Scare Game! Yeah! We have a special guest, the founder of the games, Dean Hardscrabble. Good afternoon. As a student, I created these gas as a friendly competition, but be prepared. To take home the troph, you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus. So good luck, and may the best monsters wi. We're closing down sign-, so we'll see you all... Wait! I'm signing up! What? Uh... You have to be in a fraternity to compete. Behold the next winning fraternity of the Scare Games, the brothers, my brothers, of Oozma Kappa! Hi. Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing? You just said the winners are the most fearsome monsters on campus. If I win, it means you kicked out the best Scarer in the whole school. That won't happen. How about a little wager? If I win, you let me back in the Scaring program. And what would that prove? That you were wrong. Very well. If you win, I will let your entire team into the Scare program. But if you lose, you will leave Monsters University. Deal. Now all you need to do is find enough members to compete. We need six guys, right? Sorry, chief. We count bodies, not heads. That dude counts as one. Anybody else want to join our team? Anyone at all? Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late. Can I squeeze by you? Randy! Randy, thank goodness. I need you on my team. Oh. Sorry. I'm already on a team. Boggs. I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike. Don't blow this for me. Do the thing. Oh! Where did he go? Please, anybody. I need one more monster. Just one more! Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good. We have to move on. Your team doesn't qualify. Yes, it does! The star player has just arrived. No way! Someone else! Please! Anyone else. We're shutting down sign-ups, okay? Is he on your team or not? Come on! Let's go! Fine! Yes, he's on my team. Good luck. All right, Wazowski, what's the plan? This is a fraternity house? Hey there, teammates! Come on aboard! As the president of Oozma Kappa, it is my honor to welcome you to your new home. We call this room "Party Central." Technically, we haven't actually had a party here yet. But when we do, we'll be ready! Wooh! The hot cocoa train is coming through! Whoa! Next stop... You! I would like to start us off first by... So, you guys are Scaring majors? We were! None of us lasted very long. I guess we just weren't what old Hardscrabble was looking for. Don Carlton, mature student. Thirty years in the textile industry and then old dandy Don got downsized. Figured I could throw myself a pity party, or go back to school and learn the computers. Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"... And I'm Terri with an "I"! I'm a dance major! And I'm not. Five, six, seven, eight! Seven, eight, turn! And... Why didn't you turn? Because we never agreed to do this! You said this was going to be cool! No one said this was gonna be cool. Now I'm embarrassed. Now you're embarrassed? Yes, because it's in front of people! You should wake up embarrassed. Hey, hey, hey! I'm Art! New Age philosophy major. Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you. Thought you might like to keep a dream journal. Guess that leaves me. Ah! My name's Scott Squibbles. My friends call me Squishy. I'm undeclared, unattached, and unwelcome pretty much everywhere but here. Now that we've all been introduced, as captain of our team... So, basically, you guys have no Scaring experience? Not a lot! But now we've got you! You're about the scariest fella I've ever seen. Even with them pink polka dots. Aw, thanks. Actually, I think I bring the whole package. Your hands are as big as my face! He's like a Mountain with fur! Oh, come on. I don't even work out. - Yeah, me neither. - I don't want to get too big. We thought our dreams were over, but Mike said if we win, they're letting us in the Scaring program. We're going to be real Scarers! The best! You betcha! Yeah! Right. And here's what you've been waiting for, fellas. Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom. Oh... Great! We're sharing this room? We'll let you guys get settled. Anything you need, you just give a big holler-oonie! Okay, thanks, buddy. Are you kidding me? Look, they don't need to be good. I'm going to carry the whole team. Really? And who's going to carry you? Hey, if you want to go back to can design, you know where the door is. Great. Guys? Anybody home? Um... Hello? Fellas? Do you pledge your souls to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood? Ow! Do you swear to keep secret... all that you learn here? No matter how horrifying? Hey! Will you take the sacred oath of the... For crying out loud. Sweetie! Turn the lights on while you're down here! You're going to ruin your eyes! Mom! We're doing an initiation! Oh, scary. Well, carry on. Just pretend I'm not here. This is my Mom's house. Do you promise to look out for your brothers... no matter what the peril? Will you defend Oozma Kappa no matter how dangerous? No matter how insurmountable the odds may be? From evils both great and small? In the face of unending pain and... Oh, forget it! You're in. Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us. Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers. Time for a celebration! Yeah! Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen, because we're building a fort! Mom, can we stay up late tonight? Mmm, I know you're a princess and I'm just a stable boy. Yuck! Mom! What are you doing? Your grubby paw was in my bed! Were you kissing my hand? No. And what about you with all your shedding? I don't shed. Really. Uh... Excuse me. I just want to get my stuff. Would you just... Oh, hey. Come on! Let me get my stuff! My butt! First morning in the house. That's going in the album! Guys! We got a letter! A letter? We never get mail. Oh! Sorry. It's stuck. Would you... Give me that! Tentacles. They're sticky. It's the first event of the Scare Games. "A child's room is where you scare," "but avoid the toxicity lurking there." Wait a minute. Where do they want us to meet? Of all the sewers on campus, this one has always been my favorite. Art, you've been here before? I have a life outside of the house, you know. Welcome to your worst nightmare, the Scare Games! Scare Games! Scare Games! Yes! Yes, I love it! I love this energy! Okay. Okay, everybody. Let's hear it for the frats and sororities competing in this year's games... Jaws Theta Chi! Python Nu Kappa! Slugma Slugma Kappa! Roar Omega Roar! Eta Hiss Hiss! And finally, Oozma Kappa. Yay! Wooh-hoo! Hi, Mom! Smile! Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge! Human children are toxic! And anything they touch is toxic. We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second, the stinging glow urchin! Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy! I want to touch it. And you certainly don't want to touch any of its friends. Yeah, I want to touch them. This is the starting line. The light at the end of the tunnel is the finish line. And whoever comes in last is eliminated from the games. Mike... What is it? Does that mean if we lose, we're out? Don't worry, Smoothie. Squishy! Squishy. We're not going to lose, because we have everything we need to win right here. Heart. No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us. All right, all right. That's very cute, It's an obstacle course. What are you going to do? Roar at it? I can get through faster than you, little guy. Take your place at the starting line! This is all about teamwork. Everybody, stick together. I'm going to beat you over that finish line. Get ready to eat my dust. Hey, guys, should we huddle up? Attention, teams. One last thing. Scarers work in the dark. I want to go home! On your marks... Hey, uh, good luck, ladies. Thanks! We're going to rip you to pieces! What? Get set... Go! I'm going to touch them! Ow! Come on! Uh, guys! We're falling behind a little! Fellas! Cheese and crackers! Son of a mustache! Salisbury steak, that hurts! Is that as fast as you can go? Just getting started! What the... Whoa! Ah! Oh... Ah! That's got to hurt! Ow, ow, ow... Ooh! Terry! Don't worry, we'll be fi... Ha-ha! Oh... Uh-oh. Yikes! Ow! Ow, ow, ow... Roar Omega Roar wins! Take that, Wazowski! Are you delirious? I beat you! Get your eye checked! Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas! Hey! Second place ain't bad. Second place, Jaws Theta Chi! What? Your whole team has to cross the finish line. Third place, EEKs! - Fourth place, PNKs! - No. Fifth place, HSS! No, no, no! And in last place, Oozma Kappa. I can't feel my anything. Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa has been eliminated! No. Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski. It would have taken a miracle for you to... Attention, everyone. We have an announcement. Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified. The use of illegal protective gel is 'cause for elimination. What! Which means Oozma Kappa is back in the games! It's a miracle! Your luck will run out, eventually. This is going to be harder than I thought. Okay! Listen up, Oozmas. Now, we're going to have to start winning these things together, so that means I'm going to need each of you guys to pull your own weight. Mike? What is it? We've made a list of our strengths and weaknesses. In high school, I was the master of the silent scare. I could sneak up on a field mouse in a pillow factory. Sorry! They get stickier when I'm sweaty. Oh, my gosh, that's terrible. We're experts in the ancient craft of close-up magic. It's all about misdirection. Uh... I have an extra toe. Not with me, of course. Guys, one slip-up on the next event, and we're goners. So for this to work, I'm gonna need you to take every instinct you have and bury it deep, deep down. Done. From now on, we are of one mind. My mind. Oh, please. I will tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it. Uh... Okay, Mike. Seems about right. All right. Give me scary steps. Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go! You're wasting your time. We need a new team. We can't just "get a new team"! I checked this morning. It's against the rules. What if we disguised a new team to look like the old team? Oh, no, no. We are not cheating. It's not cheating. I'm just, you know, leveling the playing field. Okay, so it's kind of cheating, but what do you want me to do? They're not exactly the scariest group in the world. Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish! Make a wish! This is not going to work. Where are you going? We're training. I'm a Sullivan. That's not enough. You're all over the place. You're charging ahead when you... Bup, bup, bup! You tell them what to do but not me. So long, Coach. Okay, Oozmas... Boy, we need to get you a Bell. Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming, they'll call Mom or Dad", "then you'd better run fast or things will get bad." Huh? In the next event, if even one of us gets caught, we're all out. So remember, do exactly what I do. We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting. Got it. Only two teams left. Who will make it out with their flag, and who will be eliminated? You do not want to get caught by a kid's parent. And in this event, you do not want to get caught by the librarian. Quiet. What's so scary about a little old librarian? I said, "Quiet." Faster. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Slow and steady. Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan! Hmm. Whew! Ooh! No! Five, six, seven, eight! Look over here! Is that legal? You better believe it, mop top! The only rule is don't get caught. Wooh! - Ooh! - Hey! Over here! Come and get me! Come and get me! Wooh-hoo! Guys, what are you doing? They said don't let her catch you. But they didn't say how! Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on! Whoa! Whew! We did it! No, we didn't. We forgot the flag! Mike? Way to go, Squishy! Way to go, Squishy! How? Misdirection. The EEKs have been eliminated and Oozma Kappa live to scare another day! We're Okay! We're Okay! We're Okay! I've never felt so alive! We were awesome! Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring. It was better than what you did. You should've stuck to my strategy. Whatever. Talk to me when we start the real Scaring. Hey! You guys going to the party? Oh, I think you've got the wrong guys. - We don't get invited to... - Party? The mid-games mixer at the RORs'. It's for the top Scare Teams. See you there! Did you hear that? I can't believe it! Uh-uh. Bad idea. This is great. They're finally seeing us as real Scarers. We're going! Do young people still dance? Because my moves are a little rusty. Oh, we forgot to bring a hostess gift. We can't go in there without some scented candles. Calm down. We earned this. What if there's a lull in the conversation? I never know what to... You know... Say? How are you so good at this? You just took on an angry 50-foot librarian, and you're afraid of a little party? Take a deep breath... and in you go! Hello. It's Oozma Kappa! These guys are crazy! What you did today was insane! That was awesome! Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like Scarers! I've never stayed up this late in my life! Hey, quiet! Quiet! Quiet down, you can-wranglers. All right. On behalf of the RORs, we'd like to congratulate all the teams that have made it this far. All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs! I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS! Very creepy. And finally, the surprise team of the Scare Games, Oozma Kappa! Now, I got to admit, fellas, I thought you were a bunch of nobodies. But, boy, was I wrong. Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa! Oozma Kappa! Oh! What? The most adorable monsters on campus. Ooh! Oh! Release the stuffed animals. Faced! - Don't worry. - Nobody reads the school paper. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they read the quad. Wooh-hoo! Thank you very much. Okay. Would you like that with two sleeves or four? Thanks. Tell your friends. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Raising a little money for charity. Yeah? Well, stop it. You want us to stop raising money for charity? That's not cool. This guy hates charity! I want you to stop making us look like fools. Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools. Let's be honest, boys. You're never going to be real Scarers, because real Scarers look like us. But, hey, if you really want to work for a Scare company they're always hiring in the mail room. Guys, hold on! Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second. Don't listen to him. We just need to keep trying. No, you need to stop trying! You can train monsters like this all you want, but you can't change who they are. Mike... We appreciate everything you've done, but he's right. No matter how much we train, we'll never look like them. We're built for other things. Sorry, squirt! Some monsters just aren't cut out for the big leagues. The big leagues.
