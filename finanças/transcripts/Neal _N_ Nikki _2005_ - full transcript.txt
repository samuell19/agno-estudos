Blue-41. Set. Hut, hut, hut. Hi, I'm Neal, a typical Indian guy. But there's nothing typically Indian about me. I've never even been to India. Dad was an oat farmer there. But now... he raises horses. After settling in Canada, Dad brought Mom over from Punjab. The result of their 25 years of hard work is not me. It's Albert, their horse. You always fawn over pretty women. You completely forget about me. I make tea, I cook the meals, but they get the kisses. Don't be ridiculous. When did you ever cook anything for the horse? Let's take a picture. Don't touch me. Mom and Dad are so cute. They can't live without each other, yet, when they're together, they always bicker. Unfortunately, they are both very happy. And now they want to see me happy. They want me to get married. Me. The Neal. Don't get me wrong, girls aren't a problem. -Neal, he rocks... -They love me. ...and he's the one to score. You thought you've seen the best, but he's here to show you more. N-E-A-L. Go, Neal! They let the whole world know that they're crazy about me. I'm kidding. Girls aren't that crazy. It's not that I don't want to get married, but you need the right kind of girl, not a domesticated, homey type, you know? I've told Mom, I'm the athletic type. I like football. Then I have the perfect girl. She's sporty and athletic, just like you. Hi. I'm Minni. Want to play? If I never have kids, it'll be thanks to Minni. Neal, look who's here. Your daddy's best friend, Uncle Harpreet, and Aunt Cherry, and their daughter Katrina. Nice. Hello. How you doing? Okay, what's wrong with her? She's pretty. Forget about pretty, she's hot. What are you saying, Neal? Mom and Dad actually got it right? Damn, I wish this was as simple as buying a car. At least when you buy a car, you can test drive it. You can check how to handle it, its power, how smooth it is. Can it handle curves? Did you say something? Would you like to go for a drive? -I'd love to. -Great. Harpreet, come on. Let me show you my horse. He's won every award. He's so proud of him. He's always praising him. Why shouldn't I be? You can recognize his breeding in everything he does. He makes the Punjabi name proud. You go, girl. What is it? He's a little big, but don't worry. -What? -Mommy. Oh, my God. Hello. This is Gyaniji. His job is to impart wisdom, but I'm the only one he seems to impart it to. And I have to listen because in our house Gyaniji is second only to Babaji. Half of Mom's sentences start with, "Gyaniji was saying..." I was saying there's no need to worry. And this is Gyaniji's son, Happy. Sardar with a guitar, who wants to be a rock star. Gyaniji, what should I do? Start the marriage preparations. The girl for Neal will come from Bathinda. A pretty girl From Bathinda Dressed in pink With silver sequined shoes Her flowing tresses Make the fields go wild She's loved by God She's loved by all Her face is sweet Her soul is sweet Everyone calls her Sweety Neal, what are you doing? I can't believe you're getting married. Haven't you been listening to me? Marriage is not a good thing. Do we look like happy guys? Look what his wife has done to him. He's got to wear tight clothes all the time. As soon as I got married, my life was over. After this you're pretty much done. Why did you agree to the wedding? Some girl from Bathinda? You've never even met her. Stop panicking, guys, relax. I decided a long time ago that I would have an arranged marriage. Why? Have you seen my girlfriends? Would you marry any of them? It's simple, dude. I don't trust my choice in women. That's why I agreed to marry Sweety. Dad, in a few days I'll be married and my life will change forever. And you know what's next. I want to spend the next 21 days in Vancouver. You know, big city, lots of fun. Dad, I just want to have some fun. Neal, why do you think that married men don't have fun? Dad, are you having fun? Go, son, go. -You sure? -Sure. -Dad! -Yeah! Yup! Hello, Vancouver! Vancouver, here I come.

I'm so sorry, you poor baby. I know this really great place. You can actually view the whales in their natural habitat. -Do you want to come? -Yes. -Really? -Yes. -Okay, come on, let's go -Let's go. You can see the whales if we swim just past that island. And the water, it's going to be little bit cold, but don't worry. Once you jump in, your body heat is going to heat it up.

Aren't you coming in? -Hello? -Is this Neal? Yes. Are you the idiot who took me to the hotel last night? Yes. I mean, no. Did you take me to the Thorny Rhino or not? Yes, but... I mean, no... So you weren't the naked guy with me in the hotel room? No. I mean, yes. I mean, no. Neal, I'm getting cold. Are you coming in? Oh, my God. Are you in hotel room with a naked girl right now? Yes. I mean, no. What a creep! Meet me in half an hour at the Bayview Bar. I want to know what you did with me last night. I haven't pressed charges yet, but if you don't show up, I will personally come and cut off your... I'll be there. May I help you? You're fired. -You can't fire me. -Why not? 'Cause I quit. Hi, I'm Neal. Nothing happened last night. It's a misunderstanding, In fact, I was on a date, you were drunk and you came on to me and... What? -I went to a hotel with you? -Yes. How drunk was I? What do you mean? Never mind. Why did you take me to a hotel? Because you said, "Take me home." Home, not the Thorny Rhino! If my friend hadn't called last night, what would have happened? -But nothing happened. -I know. Good, then I'm glad this is all cleared up. -I'm out of here. -No, sit. There's something I don't understand. Why were you naked? Did I tell you to take your clothes off? Yes, I mean, no. Look, I'm going to count to 10, and if you don't tell me what you were doing with me in that hotel room, I will scream rape. You don't know me, I'll do it. One... Two... Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! I took shower, when I came out, the towels were next to you. Why? The hotel staff must have put them there. No, stupid, why did you take a shower? Because I wanted to. I don't believe this. Do you really think I want to be anywhere near a desperate, alcoholic crazy, stupid, dumb bimbo, who thinks that she can get a date by saying, "Give me a corkscrew"? Dude! Dude. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... My boyfriend left me. He dumped me. I should go. Do you know why he left me? No, but you're going to tell me. I don't even know. I miss him. I hate him. Bastard. I don't know why, but I miss being in love. But it's over. I know it must be tough, but drinking isn't going to bring him back. No wonder your boyfriend left you. Nikita Bakshi. Guinness Towers, please. -Hey, Kristy. -Hey. I've really missed you. Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you, but I don't have your number. Do you want it? Yeah. Great. It's 5-5-5...

Hi, I'm Neal. Hi, Neal. Nice to meet you. You really like to dress up for coffee, don't you? I've just run away from a wedding. Poor groom. Not mine, silly. It wasn't my wedding. Interesting pictures. That. Actually, I met her at a party. I spoke to her for a few minutes. She just emailed me her photos. It must be difficult, being so popular with the girls. What to do? Ever since I came to Vancouver, girls just can't get enough of me. -You're new to Vancouver? -Yes. I know a girl who's just your type. Would you like her number? Sure. Why not? Great. Are you looking for a pen? What's that? -Me. -"Me" smells nice. Call her. She's awesome. -Excuse me. -Yes. -Read my chest. -What? Read my chest, dude. Absolutely, honey. 5-5-5-2-0-7-2 Thank you. I liked him. Hey, Neal. Hi, awesome. Let's meet tonight at 7:00. Pacific Center. Don't be late. I just love tennis. Want to play? No. It's more fun watching. You know, the power, the swing, the energy... And the miniskirts? Actually, it's only the miniskirts. Shall we go? Aren't you going to have a shower? Why? You don't like me all hot and sweaty? No, I thought I'd join you. Hey, Nikki. Hi. I want you to meet someone special. My new instructor, Nikki. She's just joined us and she plays very well. Come on.

Okay. -Bye. -Bye. Nikki. You know, sometimes I feel like I should quit law to play tennis. I just love that sport. The energy, the physical exercise and the power. I'm good at it, you know, and I... What? Nothing. Come on, why are you smiling like that? I just played strip poker with you in my mind, and you lost. Impossible. That wouldn't happen, I never lose. Never? I only lose when I want to lose. I like to be in control. So what makes you lose control? You. Neal? It's me, Nikki. Hi! I've been looking all over for you. That night when you helped me at the restaurant, I felt like we really bonded. I felt like I found a true friend. -Nikki! -Yes? What are you doing here? It's my new job, you know... No, I don't want to know, Can't you see that I'm doing someone... Something? What's your problem? Why are you always at the wrong place? Why do you always come to the wrong place at the wrong time? In 21 days I'm getting married and I've only come to Vancouver to get some action. And this chick was the easiest action ever. I didn't mean that. I could get you some action. You also supply girls? I can take you someplace where you will get as much action as you want. That's why I came to Vancouver. That's your first mistake. The only mistake I made was meeting you. Meeting me is the best mistake you ever made. Really? How? I can take you to Whistler. Wow, Whistler, yay! What happens there? Wouldn't you like to know? Nikki, you owe me this. Dude, Whistler is babe heaven. All the beautiful women of the world go there. -Jennifer Lopez. -Yeah. -Whistler. -Yeah? -Julia Roberts. -Yes. Whistler. -Britney Spears. -No way. Yeah way. Guys go there when they want to have a good time. -I didn't know that. -I can see that. Very funny. I can take you there. Why would you take me there? I feel sorry for you. You're getting married. So you'd take me to Whistler because you feel bad for me? I'm a nice girl. You're not nice, you're crazy. Yeah. I'm a crazy nice girl who's going to Whistler to find a new job. What about this job? I quit. Thirty-three, intelligent, lawyer, divorced and disturbed, hates men. I have no chance with her. What are you doing? -See her? -Yes. What do you think she does? -I don't know. -Go on, guess. Okay, I think she's a social worker who works in an orphanage. She likes to play with the kids. She looks kind, gentle, loving, you know? Sweet. No, stripper. -No. -Yeah. -Really? -Yes. You can tell what a girl does just by looking at her? And I can predict if she will, you know... -Really? -Yes. Okay, do me. Here? Now? No, stupid. Analyze me. Okay. Rich parents, only child. Your parents sheltered you. You do what you want because you know your parents will be there to look after you. But now you feel you can't do anything on your own. You've become too dependent. That's why you've asked your parents for a year alone in the city to prove that you're independent, you can take care of yourself, and can make your own decisions because you're a grownup now. Oh, my God, you got all that just by looking at me? No, I read the email you wrote to your mom and dad. What? Oh, yeah, and you're a virgin. I... No, I'm not! I'm not a virgin. Refusing to admit it. Denial. First sign. I'm so not a virgin. Second sign, body language. Nobody come near me. You don't know anything. I'm not a virgin. I've done it. I mean... I've done it lots of times. -Really? -Yeah. -What does it feel like? -Kickass. -Kickass. -Yeah. Haven't done it, huh? No. But I choose not to. That's why your boyfriend chose to dump you. That's none of your business. Who do you think you are? You think you know me now? You don't know anything. Hey, no need to get angry. It's your decision. Live with it. -I am living with it. -Good. I don't even know if I did the right thing or not. It's so confusing. Sometimes I think I should have with Trish. You know, I should have just done it with him. Maybe he was the special one. The special one. Part of this complete nutritious breakfast. Go ahead, make fun of me. No, I'm not going to. You did the right thing. The first time should be with someone special. -Do you know why? -Why? Because you never forget your first time. And if the first time is with an idiot, you'll have to remember that idiot for the rest of your life. -And you? -What about me? Who was your idiot? Excuse me. Your first time? Was it special? Why would I tell you? Why not? Who was she? I'm not going to tell you. I know! You paid for it. You must have given her money. -No, I did not. -Did too. -Did not. -Did too. Did not.

Good for you. I've totally forgotten Trish. Good. If someone were to ask me about Trish, I'd say "Trish who?" Very good. -God, it feels so good. -Good. -Neal, hold me. -What? Take me in your arms. Just hold me. Nikki, I know you're getting over from this Trish thing, -but I don't think you and I... -Neal. I only want you to just hold me. Okay, Nikki, I think you need to relax. What part of "hold me" don't you understand, asshole? I don't want to hold you. Everyone is watching. Hey, isn't that your boyfriend, Trish? Who? Where? There. You horrible, evil, manipulative little... I can explain. This is why you brought me to Whistler? To make your boyfriend jealous? I can't believe I fell for this. Actually, it was quite easy. So, since you're here, just hold me. My God, that poor guy doesn't know what's about to hit him. You know what, I'm going to tell him everything. -I'll tell him to run for his life. -No. I'm gonna tell every guy I see to stay away from you. Trish! Hey, Trish! Why are you behaving like a girl? You used me. It was just a kiss. Just a kiss? Before kissing something needs to exist between people. Some sort of relationship. A kiss is the meeting of two spirits, two souls, two minds. For God's sake, I didn't rape you. You did worse. You conned me. -I needed your help. -You should have asked. -Would you have helped me? -No. -Neal. -Don't do that. Don't do what? "Neal." Don't get cute with me. It won't work. So what will? Nothing. Nothing'll work. What if I get you a girl? Excuse me? Did you say what I think you said? I'm the Neal. I don't need your help. I can get any girl I want. Really? Then why did you come to Whistler with me? I... I... I came to see the sights Go ahead. Pick a girl. The girl of your choice. Fine. I can pick a girl. That one. That one? -Yeah. -Done. Neal, meet my friend, Marie. Nikki's been telling me all about you. Really, now? She's easy. You'll get some action. If what she says is true, then... Then? Then we must hang out. Come by my work at the crab shack at 7:00, and we'll get together. -Cool. -Okay? You can stop drooling, she's gone. What did you tell her? Do we have a deal? Deal. What do I have to do? You have to make me yours. Cool. Shall we get a room? Not like that, stupid. You have to win my heart. Write me poems praising my beauty and then sing them to me like songs of love. The air will be filled with their melody, they will echo from the mountains, rivers and the valleys and everyone will hum your tunes. And when you sing, the whole world will know what true love means. Are you totally insane? Who does that? You expect me to do this? Don't be silly. You performing Amitabh Bachchan's songs? Never. I want you to do this. I want to make Trish jealous. I want to make him beg. When he sees you making a complete fool of yourself, he'll come running back to me. He'll beg me to come back to him. Men, they have small hearts, small brains, and small... everything. Egocentric, possessive morons. Except you. Okay, I'll do it, but on one condition. What? No more of that kissing stuff, please. Don't worry. Nobody kisses in Hindi films. With your charming ways With the tunes that you hum And the way you smile I'm in love When we kiss and make up I don't know why I'm in love I've waited forever Oh, my God, I'm in love With rejection With acceptance And with your every nuance I'm in love Unknowingly and strangely From now to eternity I'm in love I've waited forever Oh, my God, I'm in love You're my dream My love, my light I just wanna spend My life with you You're the one that Makes me smile I just wanna spend My life with you Now that you've filled my dreams I want stay in this trance forever I'm here all around you I'm in your arms with you Believe me, I'm real In the day or at night With everything that Keeps you in sight I'm in love In sunshine and in rain We meet time and again I'm in love I've waited forever Oh, my God, I'm in love My darling, let's go Chase the stars You're my dream My love, my light I just wanna spend My life with you You're the one that Makes me smile I just wanna spend My life with you The color of your eyes Is the color of the sky Let me be a cloud in them You've played with the stars The moon is your friend I'll be the cloud that engulfs you With your charming ways With the tunes that you hum And the way you smile I'm in love When we kiss and make up I don't know why I'm in love I've waited forever Oh, my God, I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love You're my dream My love, my light I just wanna spend My life with you My life with you I just wanna spend My life with you Hey, Nikki. Trish? Hi! What are you doing here? Well, I'm here for a, you know, an ad shoot and, well, actually, Nikki. I'm not going to lie to you. I came here with Amanda. We are here for the weekend. So are we. This is Neal and I'm not going to lie to you, this is my Neal. Neal, this is an old friend, Trish. No way. You're Trish? Yeah, the only one. I'm like a big fan. I've seen all your ads. Especially the underwear one, that's my favorite. Get it on Get going, man The briefs that make you feel Like Superman Trish! That's my favorite too, you know? Really. What's he doing? He speaks French when he gets really excited. Hey, why don't you guys come to my place for the day? -I don't think we... -We would love to. Great. So I'll SMS you the address with directions. It's not far, it's like half an hour from here, but, you know, the way Nikki drives it might take you maximum five minutes. I know what you mean. So, Neal, it was really good to meet you. Oui, it was good to meet you, too. What are you doing? Helping you. You wanted Trish back, right? Did you notice that he couldn't lie to you about Amanda? He still loves you. That's why he invited us to his house. Because he likes you, not me. He was totally indifferent towards me. I'm going back to Vancouver. If that's the case, then why is he checking you out. -Really? Right now? -Not now. Okay, you can look now. Just keep making him jealous, he'll come crawling back to you. You're good. I'm driving. Hey, Nikki. Trish! Neal, Nikki! Hey, guys, please come in. What a cool place you have here, Trish. Thank you. The girls seem to like it. Where's Amanda? She's upstairs, she's getting ready. I've put some crab on the barbeque. It might take a while to get ready. -You guys want to play a game? -Yeah. -What about water volleyball? -Super. Great. So we have a guest room just over there, you can get changed and I'll meet you by the pool. Hey, Nikki, you look different. Is it a new hair cut? It's her eyes, she's tried something new. You're right, Neal. It's in the eyes. See you. How's it going, guys? Hey, you. Hi, Amanda. I just loved the way you sing to Nikki. I mean, I've never seen someone so romantic. I have to tell you it did something to me. Something deep inside. I mean, I would do anything for a man who would sing to me. Do you want to swap partners? In water volleyball, silly. Come on, you should be on my team, I think it'd be fun. Let the games begin. If you a get this next one, I'll sleep with you. You're dead, you're gone. Let's go. Let's go. I'm coming to get you. You are history. I'm sorry. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, of course. It has swollen up, hasn't it? Just a little bit. How big is a little? Oh, my God. Show me a mirror now! And you can carry me, Trishi pooh. Where are you going? I'm going to kill Neal. Wait, by the evening it will slowly go down. -I'm still going to kill him. -Wait. Nobody is going to notice your nose, I promise you. Not when they can see the rest of you. Do know what was the first thing I noticed about you? My eyes? No, it was your smile. Your eyes... this was a bonus. From the many hued clouds With the kohl from your eyes I've written your name across my heart Amanda Come on. Let's go. -Now? -Yes, now. But I mean, I'm like, you know. Let's go. No. I love you. No. She's mine. Okay, tell me now, what happened? Nothing. Oh, my God, you did it. He wants you back, right? Yup, he loves me and he hates you... I just hate him. What the hell are you doing with a guy like him? Did you hear him when you were singing? He sounds like a pig. A pig with a sore throat. I'm jealous, Nikki. It destroys me inside. It hurts me so, so bad. Trishi pooh misses you so much. I need you again. Please. Come back in my life. Please. And Amanda? Amanda? Finished. Gone. Over. Hasta la vista, baby. I told you. I told you so. Knowing you, you must have melted and ran right into his arms and said, "It's so good to have you back, Trishi pooh." No. I left him. I dumped him. What? -What? -I don't know. I don't understand French. But I thought you loved him. Then why did you dump him? Because he cheated on me. The day I found out he'd been seeing Amanda when he was with me, I forgot everything we ever had. The only thing that upset me was that I hadn't dumped him first. At first I thought it was my fault that he left me for Amanda. He made me hate me and then it hit me. Who's he to dump me? I should be the one to dump him. So you did all this to get him back just to leave him? -Yup -Doesn't make sense. You're a guy, you won't understand. Nikki Bakshi, you've got guts. I like it. I hope you let him off easy. Yeah, you know me, I wouldn't hurt anyone. I'm harmless. -Come on, Neal. Let's go. -Okay! Where? It's payback time. You helped me, now it's my turn. I'll give you everything you ever wanted. Nikki Bakshi is going to give you a night you're going to remember for the rest of your life. Wait a minute. What's on your mind? Why don't you read it? Why are these people celebrating Christmas in summer? Did you see the elves? Oh, my God. Can I be Santa? Go ahead, pick an elf. What's the hurry? We just got here. Let me check them out. Can I get a red wine, please? Of course. Here you go. -Thank you. -Hey, you want to dance? Sure. Bye. Come on, show it to me. Oh, no. I'm going to beat that. -What are you playing? -Strip poker. The loser has to take a piece of clothing off. I'm going to show it to you now. Read them and weep. As you can see, I'm winning. Excellent, girls. Excellent, excellent. -I want to play, too. -What? Yes, I want to play, too. Guys, can I play? For sure, girl. For sure you can play. I'll do anything to get you to play. You're not playing. Come on, man. Look at her, she's hot. -Nikki, get up. -No. -You can't play. -Why not? Because I said so. This game isn't for you. Why not? What are you afraid of? That I'll win, or that I'll lose? Okay, fine. Deal. Now it's going to get good. So, guys, if I lose, what do I take off first? Damn, girl, you don't even want me to answer that. So how many cards do I deal? Neal, are you crazy? Don't touch me. I'm just taking you for a little ride. Put me down. What are you doing? I will kick you. -One second. -Put me down. -Here you go. -Put me down! God! You're allowed play, but not me? You have such double standards. What's your problem? What's my problem? What's your problem? Actually, forget it. You wouldn't understand. You're a girl. Neal! Neal, hey, listen. I'm sorry. I was just kidding. Please? Sorry? You know, when you get angry, you look just like Scooby-Doo. Go ahead, pick a girl. Yes, think of it as a Christmas present from me. Pick the best one. The one who makes you weak in the knees. So, Neal, who's the girl who really, really does it for you? You. Why did you do that? -Because you wanted it too. -No. Come on, Nikki. Don't you think there's something between us? There's nothing between us. You're lying. Why are you lying? Look at the way you give me that look. What look? That look. That "come on, baby, rock my world" look. Puke. You and me? Never. You're a jerk who's getting married in a few days and you're only here to get some action. I'm the good girl in the story. Nothing can happen between us. -Nothing? -Nothing. You didn't feel anything? You didn't feel the chemistry? No. We're both always looking for reasons to get closer to each other. Really, you didn't feel anything at all? Nothing? Oh, my God. That was amazing. You can't make me feel this good. What's wrong with you? We have to solve this. We have a problem. Okay. -Nothing can happen between us. -Nothing. You go that way and I'll go this way. We'll stay far away from each other. Yeah, that's a good idea. Brilliant. Go. -Okay. You sure? -Yeah. Cool. See you in 100 years. What have I done? I spent the night with Neal. Neal the jerk. Neal the idiot, Neal the... Wonderful. Last night was wonderful. I've never felt so complete. I don't know if you're feeling the same way. This feels so right. No, you feel right. Last night felt so right. Neal, you've lost it. This is Nikki you're talking about. The same girl who went crazy over her ex-boyfriend, the same girl who wanted to cut off your... -Good morning. -Good morning. "Good morning"? What does that mean? Nikki, "good morning" means that last night meant nothing to him. You were just another girl. Idiot, why did you say "good morning" like that? Okay, turn around, hold her, and tell her how wonderful this morning is. Why did she get up? Before she leaves, talk to her. Nice day, isn't it? I don't believe this, we're gonna talk about the weather? How predictable. Who wants to talk about last night? No one. Would you like some coffee? Coffee? What I would like to know is what you thought of last night, Mister-Know-It-All? What I would like to know is am I one of those girls you came to Vancouver for? What I would like to know is why are you asking me for coffee? Coffee would be fine. Coffee? Why did I ask her for coffee? I don't even make coffee. Why I didn't meet you before? -I think... -Don't even think that. If you think that I'm going to drink this coffee, you must be crazy. Look at her. She'll be the perfect wife. Mom would like her too. Actually, Mom wouldn't like her at all, but who cares? Nikki, there's something I want to say. I knew this was coming. He'll say, "Nikki, you're very sweet and last night was very special, but..." Nikki, you're very sweet and last night was very special... Nikki, he's about to dump you, just like Trish. Don't let him do it. Before he dumps you, dump him. Neal, I know what you're going to say. What happened last night happens very rarely. Wow, Neal, you and Nikki think alike. The timing is perfect. Propose to her. Tell her you want to marry her. Oh, God, how pathetic. What's he doing on his knees? Will he beg? Will he ask me not to tell anyone? Will he tell me not to expect anything from him? Before he hurts you, dump him. It's okay, get up. Forget about last night. It didn't mean anything. Let's move on, shall we? Do you want me to drive? No. Why, do you want to drive? No. Do you want me to drive? No. Good. Great. Did you want it on? No. Good. Why did we stop? Guys, can we please get a ride to Vancouver? Please. We've been walking on this road for so long and we just really need to get back. I mean, we're going to lose our jobs if we don't. Please. Can we please get a ride? Get in. Can I turn the radio on? Look at him, he's touching the poor thing all over. With her permission, and she seems to be enjoying it. I knew the moment I saw him that he was a scoundrel. Or she could be the one playing him. Or he's gonna take advantage of her and then leave her. She could stop him, but it's pretty obvious that she doesn't want to. I knew you would think like that. You guys are all the same. After you get what you want, you're gone. It's not always on us. She must have blinded him with her sweet talk so she can have a good time. She probably has an ex-boyfriend who dumped her and she's using this guy to get even with him. Get out. Nikki? Nikki? What are you doing? Nikki? Nikki, what's wrong with you? I'm saying goodbye. Last night was the biggest mistake of my life. Nikki, Nikki, Nikki! Nikki, listen to me... You're the idiot I'll have to remember for the rest of my life. Get out. Get out. By God's grace I've been given an opportunity to unite two wonderful families. This is Baldev Raj, who I've known for a long time. It's okay, you can stay seated. This is Sweety's mother, just in from Bathinda, and this is her older brother, Kuldeep who owns this house. Sister, please call Sweety. With anklets on her feet The girl with the creamy complexion Has arrived Everyone calls her Sweety Hello. Wow, she's beautiful. Is this your first time in Canada? No, I used to come during my summer vacations. How do you like Canada? I feel at home. Sweety, you forgot the cake... You forgot the cake. Hello. This is my daughter, Nikki. She and Sweety are cousins, but they're more like sisters. They share everything. -Tea? -No, thanks. -Cake? -Yes, please. -Cake? -No, thank you. You, inside. Nikki? What are you doing here? Mom said the boy's name was Gurneal Ahluwalia. That would be me. I'm Gurneal Ahluwallia. You know, Gur-Neal Ahluwallia. You know what you have to do, don't you? I know, I have to change my name. No, Gur-Neal. Go outside and tell everyone that you can't go through with the wedding. Why? Why would I do that? Because you don't want to marry my cousin. Sit. I don't want to, or you don't want me to? I don't give a flying... fudge. Really? By looking at you it doesn't seem like it. It looks like you give a flying everything. That's what you think. You know what I think? I think I should marry Sweety. -What? -Yes. I kind of like her. She's the type of girl you marry. She's not the other type. What other type? The type of girl I've met recently. Don't even go there. Like that girl... What was her name? Marie, the witch? Or that man-eating monster, Karen? Or that shameless naked girl who took you to see the whales? What was her name? Hey, hey. That's not fair. You're hitting below the belt I haven't even started yet. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to tell everyone what you were doing in Vancouver, or rather who you were doing in Vancouver. You wouldn't. Wouldn't I? -Mama! -Nikki, Nikki! What is it, dear? Neal has something to say. I do? Neal, what's the matter, son? Nothing. Not at all. Nothing. Nothing, What happened? Nothing. Neal wants to marry Sweety, as soon as possible. Congratulations! Marriages are made in heaven.

Why would I stop it? I know you, Nikki Bakshi. You couldn't even watch me dance with Sweety, how will you let me marry her? I hate you, Gurneal Ahluwallia, I hate you! -Hello, welcome. -Hello. -Congratulations. -You, too. Here I am, and where are you? You must be bringing the pooja platter. That's where she is. Aunty, where's Nikki? I don't know. We haven't seen her since this morning. Nikki, where are you? -Hello. -Hi, how are you doing? Guys, listen, I need to talk to you about something very important. We've got it all planned out, Neal. In about a week this whole drama will turn into... What drama? If you run out of your own engagement, there's obviously going to be some drama. Who is going to run? You, of course. We couldn't do it, but now you can do it. Here's the tickets. And the car is waiting out back. I'm not running anywhere, I'm looking for Nikki. -Thank you. -Nikki? Who's Nikki? Nikki, my Nikki. The girl I'm getting married to. Her name is Sweety, not Nikki. -No, dude, you're not getting it. -I get it. He's lost it. He's hysterical. He can't think straight anymore. Maybe his suit is too tight. Sometimes I can't think straight when I'm wearing tight clothes. -You're always wearing tight clothes. -Exactly. Guys, focus. Look for Nikki. Neal, what are you doing standing here? We're all waiting for you. Come, son, come. I need to check on the preparations. Aunty, has Nikki arrived? No, not yet I don't know where she is. Welcome, everyone. We are gathered here today for Satwinder Kaur and Gurneal Ahluwallia's engagement ceremony May God shower blessings upon them. They'll now exchange the engagement rings. No, thanks. This is not good. Where are you, Nikki? I'm going to get engaged. Is that an engagement ring? Yes, son. When it's put on someone's finger, it means you're engaged? Good, son. You're clear on the concept. And after the engagement, it's the wedding? Yes, of course. One second. Have you seen Nikki? Nikki? No. Okay. Go back. It's mine. Hello? Are you the jerk who slept with me and is now marrying my cousin? Yes. I'm the jerk who's marrying your cousin. So you're not going to stop this engagement? No, and if you don't want this engagement to happen, you know what you have to do. Yes, Gyaniji, where were we? She's here. My love Raanjhanaa O my love My darling This engagement can't happen. Happy, what's going on? I'm not going to allow this engagement to happen. I love Sweety. I've loved her since we were kids. We've even exchanged vows over the Internet. I can't live without her. Sweety! Happy! What's going on? Sweety and Neal's marriage is confirmed. I know, Father, that you don't want me to marry Sweety. You're always saying that Sweety is too clever, that she'd make a mouse out of me, but that she's perfect for Neal. Gyaniji? But I don't believe it. Do I look like a mouse? Sweety, hold this please. Neal, brother, I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I'm ready to fight for Sweety. Put 'em up. Put 'em up, brother. Happy, you can't marry Sweety. No, she's all yours, dude. I don't want to marry Sweety. Sweety is all yours. Enjoy. -Thanks, Neal brother. -You're welcome. -Let's go, Sweety. -Bye. Happy, listen to me. You can't marry Sweety. Dressed in pink And silver sequined shoes Come with me to the fair Pick a line? What? Any line. What do you mean? When a boy asks a girl for her hand in marriage, he needs to pick a line, so what's your line? Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me? That's your line? What part of falling in love don't you understand, jerk? I've never met such a stupid, idiotic boy! Remember that morning? It was such a special morning, but did you say, "I love you, Nikki baby"? No. You asked me do I want coffee? I don't want coffee. I don't like coffee. I don't even drink... You know what your problem is? You're a 13-year-old spoiled brat who will always be 13. And I'm the only one who can tolerate you because I'm a 14-year-old brat who will always be 14. And that's why, you fool, we're perfect for each other. I want to be part of every part of your life. So now tell me, Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me? First promise me that whenever I get emotional, you'll take care of me? Promise. Promise me that whenever I get confused, you will make me underrated? Promise. Promise me that you will always love me the way you love me right now? Promise. Promise me that you'll never look at other girls? Okay, where are we going now? Okay, ask me. What? Just do it. Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me? Yes. Cool, so... shall we kiss? No. Good. I didn't really want to. -Good. -Good. -Fine. -Fine, see you at the wedding then. -Okay. -Bye. Bye. Yoo-hoo, waiter! I'm not a waiter. Why were you naked? Because I felt like it. I felt like I found a true friend. Can't you see I'm doing someone? I could get you some action. Now you supply girls as well. Oh, yeah, and you're a virgin. No, I'm not! I've done it lots of times. Don't you think we keep looking for reasons to get close to each other? Nothing can happen between us. And now you are that idiot that I have to remember all my life. Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me? I hate you, Gur-Neal Ahluwallia. I hate you.
