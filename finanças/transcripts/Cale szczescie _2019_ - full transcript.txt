Filip, an engine costs money... “No excuses, just results!” Who says that? - She does. - Ah, she does. - Port and starboard! - Bow and stern! And graduation... - Huh? - I wish you learned that well at school. You know what? If Ms Stefanska yells at you again in math class, look her in the eye and touch your tongue to your back tooth. Makes it look like you're thinking. Are you thinking now? - Nope! - So it works! Did you ever look Stefanska in the eye? DIRECTED BY Oh, hello there, Ms. Stefanska! - Are you ashamed? - Excuse me? Ashamed of something? - No. I was just thinking. Thinking? That's good. Thinking's very important for the “queen of sciences... Sorry? For math, right? Of course! But sorry, I have to get going to work. - You have a job? - Yes, in Wejherowo. Fine, go! Then Filip will never learn when two trains leaving town A and town B... will come together! What am I talking about? About scoring' Scoring? - Getting a good score. I don't get it. As parent and teacher, we have to be in close contact, day and night. Put yourself into it! I'm all in, really, Ms Stefanska. Oh, I'll need you... all the way in. Can I go now? Goodbye. - A long wait? - Who knows? Mr. Turski... You're late and missed your entrance! Sony... my son... - You could have kept going without me. - Without you? An orchestra plays together and every single note matters! Even if someone has just five notes. Well, all I have is... Excuse me? I'm SONY. Stan again! I'm SONY. - From page 26. - Really sorry. C'mon, c'mon! What took you so long? - Which lane? - Number four. - Where have you been? - The rehearsal ran late. Filip!

Great, hold it. And jump! I cam, my trousers are tight. Don't give up, dad! Push yourself! “Lose yourself in the passion, don't lose the passion.” Do you know who said that? - She just did. - No, she repeated it. Ifs from Kierkegaard. A Danish philosopher. I'll tell you that before your next math test. Now watch carefully. Now hands up. And here we go... If you don't stop me, boss, I'll stay this way. Maybe ifs time to grab the broom? GOING BACK TO WHERE I WAS HAPPY Follow her lead! You must have some sense of rhythm? Four, five, six! Keep going! Seven, eight! UP, down! The ancients named Jupiter's moons after his lovers. His harem is trapped in by gravity, forcing them to fight for his attention. The closest is the faithful but explosive lo... Do you have smoked fish? I do. Excellent, local fish, I prepared it myself. 120 a kilo. That's expensive! There's also imported Chinese fish, 60 a kilo. The cheaper kind, please. What have things come to? My dear heavens! Selling fish from Chinese farms? That'll be 40. Best part of the seaside is the fresh fish. - Your change. - Thanks! Come one, Jessica! For crying out loud“. Dad, have you got anything good? Yeah, turbot. Two hotdogs, please. Son, don't mess with me. - I'm angry enough. - I was joking. Joking? Not funny. - So why shouldn't I have? Because there's a custom... I'm sorry! Can I have an autograph? “For Justyna". I'm a big fan. 'Really? 'Yes! I Now a selfie. Only without the boy. That's it. And the autograph. Thank you! The soloist gets flowers. Sorry, Mr... Yes? - Mr Robert Turski. - Right. The audience gave you a standing ovation. Are you satisfied with your interpretation of the piece? What? Well, you know, I'm really satisfied. Thank you. Thank you! Dad! Ms. Stefanska. I beg your pardon! - I apologize. - I just wanted... An autograph? lo say that it really moved me. Congratulations. It wasn't really due to me. Every note matters in an orchestra, but I wouldn't go overboard. Did you see? Potocka! Who? Potocka! Don't make it so obvious you're looking! What your son did was really amazing. - I really was moved. - Dad wasn't pleased. - What do you mean? - You weren't moved. - Yes I was! - I'm Filip, and dad's name is Robert. Sorry I didn't introduce myself. Robert Turski. Marta Potocka, nice to meet you. We know who you are, we watch your exercise show! Really, you both? - Dad likes to sculpt his butt. - Filip...! That's charming. Mr. Turski, there's something I want to talk to you about. Let's go outside? - Ms Potocka... - Thank you. Introduce me to her. - But I don't know her. - He does! So come on. Who is she, anyway? Ludwik, you watch her show three times a week. Say what?! Sorry, Regina. Now look what you've done. Dad has a bright future. Careful, or I might make your future much shorter. - Have you been to Budapest? - No. It was "Bucharest". And Romania. He used to play on the ferry to Batisk. Ifs “Baltiysk“. He and my mom used to make such great music - people went wild. - Cut it out! - That's what I want to talk about. - Really? You used to compose great music. How do you know? In my work, infonnation is crucial. - In fitness? - In business. But not here in the parking lot, let me take you to dinner. What a car! - We drive a Multipla. - Thanks, but we have to... - Dad! - You've got school tomorrow! - I start late! - Stop it! I want to make an offer. Thanks, but maybe next time. I'll wait for your call. 0k. Let's go. Goodbye. Wow, so amazing! Hey guys! It's not how many breaths you take... But how many moments take your breath away! Damned panga fish from Asia, he wants! I told him I'll serve panga fish here! So then he asks for a hamburger! Ah, boss, it's not worth it. - Order 74! What's your number'? - 68. Well I said 74, right? When will 68 be ready? After 82, before 47! See, why get worked up? Show some respect! Order 74, I said. Better go fast, or you might lose it! “Most interestingly, a young artist...“ - Young! “...from Puck, Robert Burski..." - You're famous! - Dr. Burski. “...who got a bouquet from the audience.” - And a standing ovation. - The conductor will be mad: not a word about him. You know what, you're jealous a celebrity invited me out. Not jealous, just surprised! Such a massive television star... Yesterday I saw her... for the first time from behind. - And? - A magnificent woman. Come on, kick it... Foul! Keep playing, no foul! What, no foul? Filip! Hi! - Marta! - Have you got a second? Sure. Then hop in. Can I? Yep! The other side. Codfish! Caught it myself. You're out of hamburgers? Watch it, son, don't start with me! Look at you, an artist now. Not an artist, Mr Turski. Look, he's a celebrity. Yep, front-page news. My face looks funny. My dear heavens! That girl was here yesterday. I was selling fresh salmon. She had some and left. What was she here for'? To eat! - She asked about you. - About what? If you lived alone, you and your son, if you still played. Looks quite intelligent, so in your shoes, I'd... Oh, my dear heavens. - Dad, please... - Ok, son. The fish will get cold. Filip! I had to start painting myself. 0k, I'm here. But where were you? I ran into Marta. You got in a stranger's car'? Not a stranger, everyone knows her. And no, the bike wouldn't fit anyway. Yellow was supposed to be mine! But what if she kidnapped you? For what, ransom? She has loads of money. She'll lend us some. What? I told her we're fixing up an old boat. You don't earn much, we redid the house. She said she'll lend us some. Have you completely lost your mind? You don't borrow money from someone you've met once. Lend to them, no, but why not borrow? You borrowed from strangers at the bank. This is better. You little economist, get painting! Ok. Keep it even! Here you've fudged a bit. - You keep distracting me! - Right. Sorry, wait a minute, ok? Hello. Sorry, I'll be blunt. What is all this? You pester my father, my son too. What's going on? Are you in love with me, stalking me? You're sure I'm waiting for you'? Aren't you? Instead of Brahms, maybe something normal? Meaning what, a disco number'? Ludwik, don't get ironic with me! - Look! - What? - Don't just stand here, go! - Me? I'm supposed to run down the stairs in these heels? Can we have a talk? You know what... Maybe next time. Hello! Mr Turski! You changed your mind. Imbecile! You let me kidnap you easier than I thought. I wouldn't say kidnap. More like evacuate. I had no choice. - Please call me Marta. - Ok, call me Robert. Here's the deal. I want to buy your music. What? You're serious? But my music is not for sale. Good music should belong to everyone. I don't even own it. It always belonged to someone else. To your dead wife. Are you always so brutally blunt? You'll get a share and a record deal, a concert tour with top-class musicians. I've played with top-class musicians. With Dragal, Gugulak etc. You tum up out of nowhere and think you can waltz into everyone's life? Not everyone's. I have no idea what you are up to. Wouldn't your wife want you do have more? You think money can fix anything? Everyone will gain, especially Filip. Shouldn't he go to a good school? Travel? Of course! But it's my and Filip's life! My responsibility! Only mine! Stop the car, I want out. I'm sorry, it came out wrong. I'm SONY. Could we meet again and talk it over'? Say at Ferment, at 9pm? Why such interest in my songs? Maybe they're good numbers? If they were, I would have sold them. I guess it's just that no one else has bought them yet. Sure. This girl shows up, super-fit, crazy for my music. I dunno, maybe someone told her you're good... - Al what? - You know. You know, in the sack. That you're, like, an animal. A puma! And, you know, maybe she really is... ls what? for you, like.“ What? - like, you know... - Spit it out! Maybe she does have a hankering for you. - A "hankering"? - Yeah. The things you say! “Hankering...” Now help me out. Keep Misting, fast! Hi. Someone's waiting. Hi. You came. I wanted to find out what all this is about. What makes the world go round... Money? Really? Money can't buy happiness, but it makes things possible. My dad says that! He also says: “Show some respect, my dear heavens! A smart man. What does he say about wine? Dad and wine? Fishermen are tough guys, they don't really drink wine. Want to try something local? - Sure! - Marek! [speaks Kashubian] Have you got something local to munch on? Maybe some “hot bangers”? - Once or twice? - Once for starters. That's what you want for starters? Yeah, ifs a local, Kashubian specialty. Lots of people start dinner with "hot..." Oops, sorry- I forgot, for non-locals it sounds a bit... You probably have a hankering... I mean, you seem hungry for something. Kale? A broccoli salad? Carrots? I'm up for trying something new. My father used to bring lots of stuff... from Sweden. Smuggling, really. One time a whole package fell into the bilge. So I ended up with of thirty pairs of jeans, all stinking of grease, and also the most beautiful Stratocaster in the whole region! Stratocaster'? An electric guitar. - A really cool one. - Ah, I didn't know. - So I had to learn to play. - And to compose. That was later. My mom enrolled me into the Moniuszko Music School. Moniuszko's music is not impressive. Actually, it's been proven to end a date quicker than anything else. Have you checked? Oh, many times. - You don't believe me? - I don't. Wait. Gentlemen, sorry, Do you know the song “The Spinner Girls"? We do. You can play it? Shall we dance? How to dance to this? Like a Polka? 0k, you're right, not good for a date. - I told you so. - But we can change that. Now that was a blow below the belt. Ifs a beautiful song. Hang on. The composer of that beautiful song is with us here tonight, Mr Robert Turski! Please come up on stage! Thank you. Because of you Again I can? sleep I feel no urge to doze When you are dose Ifs true, this moment Can give us more Than sleep ever could In me and you, there fingers Something always meant to last In me and you Love has come to pass...

Soon Potocka will whisk him off to Warsaw or Berlin, the big time. But you'll still be stuck in this provincial town. I am an esteemed conductor! Tell that to him! And get us a dinner invitation. Make sure ifs with Potocka. Understood? - Maybe you'd better go. - Me? Which of us is the esteemed conductor'? Ifs her! - Don't hide, go! - I'm not going! - What? - I will not make an idiot of myself! Ludwik! What if they've arranged... - What? - for a tete-a-tete. I can't! - Ludwik! - No! One second!

Your house is warm, beautiful. More like a battlefield. The soldiers are losing to dinosaurs, we're out of artillery. So. about last night... You didn't like it. No. I mean, yes, I liked it, but... Does Filip play? No. He didn't inherit that from me. He prefers sports, competing. Stuff like that. He recently won a swimming race, the 50-meter freestyle. Your wife. She was beautiful. I'm sorry. A glass of wine? No thanks, I'm driving. Do you have more pictures? I like them. In Filip's room. Robert, what's that smell? - Something's burning! - Damn it, my sweet potatoes! Can you get the door'? Open it, please! Ludwik Maliszewski. Sorry, I came to see Mr. Turski. Well, come in... Exactly, I was in the neighborhood so I dropped by to talk about... Oh, hello! What can I do for you? Maybe you'd like some water'? a fragment of “Spartacus” by Khachaturian. Aram Khachaturian. - Actually, I'll be going. - I'm sorry. Goodbye. Goodbye. Will they come? No!

I met her in a club. - So you're a couple? - What? - You two are a couple? - Us two? No. Sorry, man. So many guys have tried! You know that forward on the Jagiellonian team? Or Tomek Pasim? Nope. Anyway, even they failed! Everyone's tried with Marta. Even me! Her standards are too high. Dad, look, I'm surfing! Come on! - Dad! - Ok, try again.

My husband admires your talent, Robert. Really? Thanks. Al the concert, it was beautiful, like the orchestra was unnecessary! What? Every note matters! Robert, I should know, my husbands a conductor.

The repertoire's settled! We're playing Mahler, Lucewicz, Khachaturian... He's mad because he wasn't in the newspaper! Dad's the best! Sometimes something seems so close, but its so far. Those ships, I mean. In the daytime they seem so small, way far off. At night the lights seem so close. Just start swimming, and you'll be there. Once I tried. Are you kidding? To swim out to a ship? Yep- I didn't think you even knew how to swim. Back in high school. I thought, if I can do this, I can do anything. Nothing can defeat me. So what happened? It was dumb. They're too far away. I almost drowned. But you did your best. You really tried! Yep- Filip... Math always puts him to sleep. Marta? What's going on? I have to go. I'm sorry. But why? Marta? Let's go!

But back to mathematics, those trains... Ruben... those trains, their paths were meant to collide. Well, I was hoping that such a catastrophe could be avoided. It won't be a catastrophe.

A beautiful medal. Why don't you wear it? Not a medal, a talisman. I threw it into the sea. - Why'? Because I did! You don't want to talk about it. Because I got mad at it.

They say he knows everything! 0k, my lips are sealed tight. My mom... actually wasn't my mom. Well... she was, I love her. But she didn't give birth to me. Understand? It's complicated.

I don't know what to say. I don't know if I want to hear you try to explain, or if you want to. How could you? I trusted you. I know... I know all this doesn't look right... Stop! You know what? Just tell me one thing, ok? Just one thing. Should I explain to Filip, or will you do it? I do care about you. I should've done it long ago. So tell him. I'll wait outside. I deceived you two. I didn't tell you... I was your“. That I gave birth to you. And left you. Did it hurt? A lot. When you gave birth to me? YES... Mom told me about you. I didn't know your mom. But she knew you. I don't think so. I know... I know I did you wrong. I'm so sorry. You were the unfortunate one. Mom said I was her treasure, hers and dad's, they loved me very much. But you were the unfortunate one, you also love me but can't be with me. You had an amazing mom! I don't want to have a third mom. And definitely not Ms Stefanska! I'll always be your mom. I promise. Marta, we know you love sport. But let's talk about travel! You've climbed the Matterhorn, dived in deep caves. gone skydiving. What else have you got planned'? In a few days Fm taking a crew to the Amazon, to try to find the Huaorani tribe, who live isolated from civilization. So you are not quitting! What happens if you have a dream, you really try, but it doesn't work out? What then? A change of priorities. I don't dwell on failures, but head off in another direction. Whence such enthusiasm? Fuck off... in another direction! I lost my real home very early on. Actually, I owe everything to my sporting family. My fighting spirit, constantly pressing forward. All this talk about a fighting spirit, pressing ahead, sounds great, but at the end of the day, what's the point of it all? I guess... ifs to be happy, right? - Marta, are you happy? - Excuse me... Marta? Marta? You know what, next week we could paint your room. - Some new wallpaper... - What for'? Your room would be how you want it. Give me a break... Hi, it's me. I miss you too. I don't know, the sooner the better. You keep in touch with Marta? She lied to us. But you were also afraid, right? Right. But it's... not that simple, Filip. Mom said Maria's a good person, only very unfortunate, but she loves me. Filip... That was long ago. Mom wanted you to be a star in London. What? She never wanted me to... Oh, the other mom? If you want, you can see Marta sometimes. How about you? Me, no. Please wait... I said wait! Who's next? - Mel .Come You sound like local Kashubians? Nah, we're from the south. Two servings of panga. - For the kids. - Poisoning kids with panga fish? What? That's trash, not fish! My dear heavens! I can't take it anymore. Where do panga fish live? In sewers, in Bangkok! What does it eat? It eats shit! - Stefan! - Get outta my way! I'm shutting this place down! There's no local fish anymore! Respect yourselves! [speaks Kashubian] Or you can kiss my ass! Freedom, people! Starting over, at your age? Should have done it 20 years ago. Sell the joint. But your whole life is here'? Ifs a shitty life. Smelly work. I'm fed up! So what are we... what are you going to live on? I'll tell you what. On happiness! Right, Jadzia? Show him the map! My “map of dreams... All the trips to take before I die. But how? I'll sell this joint and buy a camper. Jadzia and I start travelling. Dad... You can't force her to... That's harassment, you know? Yep, harassment. We're gonna see all of Europe. Eat seafood, drink wine... and make love on the beaches. Right? Why are you staring? You stay here to play your little ding-a-ling... or say hell with it and do what you love! That's great. I'm sorry. I prepared a speech, but... you ruined it with that performance. I love you. If you can forgive me... I also... think I love you. Though l... didn't want to. I fought it. Marta, I can't trust you. I'm sorry. Where's Filip? Did you see him? No. You didn't talk to him? No, he just wrote that he would be... trying to make dreams come true. Oh, shit! Robert? Filip! Filip! Filip! Filip, are you here? Dad! Listen, Filip is lost somewhere by the sea! By himself! We're at the port, by the boat. I don't know. Oh, Jesus! Dammit, come as fast as you can. Dammit, I'm such an idiot! He always talked about those ships! Robert, go to the bow! Filip! God dammit! You told him all that motivational bullshit! Who told him about those ships?! I didn't encourage him to try it! You're the one meant to watch him! I did watch him. Until you turned up! Is that him? - (Filip?) "Dad! 'PPS you! - Filip! Dear god, ifs him! Come here, you! Dad, I thought someone stole our boat! I thought you tried to swim out to a ship? Are you crazy, they're too far. - Where were you? - On the cliff! What for'? Looking for the talisman, where I threw it. I thought it'd bring me good luck. - So did you find it? - No, that was long ago. How about this one? Sorry, it's girlish... Nice, huh? Gramps sold his place, I lost my job, Marta's not in the Amazon. - The talisman must work! - Thank our lucky stars! Throw him in! We're pleased to present Robert Turski and his band, with the shamelessly talented Gaja Hornby. I thank the stars To wake up beside you You know ifs so easy To lose the way - Not now! - Then when? - Later! - Later may be too late. Come here! it's started. So thank the stars Our lucky stars We have each other! And all that rain Falling around us Just doesn't matter A man can be like a cosine function, now up, now down. But with the right woman, he's a tangent' A steep slope, touching one point. Why talk, it makes no sense... I'm... more of a... - steep slope. - Yes? And so how do we find that point? Well, take the equation and... plug in the solution! Very good!
