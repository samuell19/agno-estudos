"REMEMBER NOW THY CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF THY YOUTH, WHILE THE EVIL DAYS COME NOT, NOR THE YEARS DRAW NIGH, WHEN THOU SHALT SAY, "I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THEM..." WHILE THE SUN, OR THE LIGHT, OR THE MOON, OR THE STARS, BE NOT DARKENED, NOR THE CLOUDS RETURN AFTER THE RAIN... IN THE DAY WHEN THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSE SHALL TREMBLE... AND THE STRONG MEN SHALL BOW THEMSELVES... AND THE GRINDERS CEASE BECAUSE THEY ARE FEW... AND THOSE THAT LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS BE DARKENED, AND THE DOORS SHALL BE SHUT IN THE STREETS, WHEN THE SOUND OF THE GRINDING IS LOW... AND HE SHALL RISE UP AT THE VOICE OF THE BIRD... AND ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF MUSIC... SHALL BE BROUGHT LOW... ALSO WHEN THEY SHALL BE AFRAID OF THAT WHICH IS HIGH... AND FEARS SHALL BE IN THE WAY... AND THE ALMOND TREE SHALL FLOURISH, AND THE GRASSHOPPER SHALL BE A BURDEN... AND DESIRE SHALL FAIL... BECAUSE MAN GOETH TO HIS LONG HOME... AND MOURNERS GO ABOUT THE STREETS... OR EVER THE SILVER CORD BE LOOSED, OR THE GOLDEN BOWL BE BROKEN, OR THE PITCHER BE BROKEN AT THE FOUNTAIN, OR THE WHEEL BROKEN AT THE CISTERN, THEN SHALL THE DUST RETURN TO THE EARTH AS IT WAS, AND THE SPIRIT SHALL RETURN UNTO GOD WHO GAVE IT." "WHAT I SHALL LEAVE THEE, NONE CAN TELL, BUT ALL SHALL SAY I WISH THEE WELL. I WISH THEE, VIN, BEFORE ALL WEALTH, BOTH BODILY AND GHOSTLY HEALTH, NOR TOO MUCH WEALTH, NOR WIT, COME TO THEE, SO MUCH OF EITHER MAY UNDO THEE. I WISH THEE LEARNING NOT FOR SHOW, ENOUGH FOR TO INSTRUCT AND KNOW- NOT SUCH AS GENTLEMEN REQUIRE TO PRATE AT TABLE OR AT FIRE. I WISH THEE ALL THY MOTHER'S GRACES... THY FATHER'S FORTUNES AND HIS PLACES. I WISH THEE FRIENDS, AND ONE AT COURT, NOT TO BUILD ON, BUT SUPPORT, TO KEEP THEE, NOT IN DOING MANY OPPRESSIONS, BUT FROM SUFFERING ANY. I WISH THEE PEACE IN ALL THY WAYS, NOR LAZY NOR CONTENTIOUS DAYS, AND WHEN THY SOUL AND BODY PART, AS INNOCENT AS NOW THOU ART." "THE WHISTLING BOY WHO HOLDS THE PLOUGH, LURED BY THE TALE THAT SOLDIERS TELL, RESOLVES TO PART, YET KNOWS NOT HOW TO LEAVE THIS LAND HE LOVES SO WELL. HE NOW REJECTS THE THOUGHT, AND NOW LOOKS O'ER THE LEA, AND SIGHS "FAREWELL!" "FAREWELL!" THE PENSIVE MAIDEN CRIES, WHO DREAMS OF LONDON, DREAMS AWAKE-- BUT WHEN HER FAVORITE LAD SHE SPIES, WITH WHOM SHE LOVED HER WAY TO TAKE, THEN DOUBTS WITHIN HER SOUL ARISE, AND EQUAL HOPES HER BOSOM SHAKE. THUS, LIKE THE BOY, AND LIKE THE MAID, I WISH TO GO, YET TARRY HERE, AND NOW RESOLVED, AND NOW AFRAID, TO MINDS DISTURBED OLD VIEWS APPEAR IN MELANCHOLY CHARMS ARRAYED, AND ONCE, INDIFFERENT, NOW ARE DEAR. HOW SHALL I GO, MY FATE TO LEARN, AND, OH! HOW TAUGHT SHALL I RETURN?" HEY, KID. YOU WANT TO, UH, PLAY? VERY GOOD. NOW, YOU KNOW THE DRILL, RIGHT? FIND THE LADY, NOT THE GUYS. WATCH CLOSELY, WHICH ONE? WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. LET'S DOUBLE UP, IF YOU'RE GOOD, RIGHT? HERE WE GO. LET'S GO. AH. BAH, BAH, BAH, BAH... DA-DUM! COME ON. LET'S GO. "MY MOTHER GROANED. MY FATHER WEPT. INTO THE DANGEROUS WORLD I LEAPT-- HELPLESS, NAKED, PIPING LOUD, LIKE A FIEND HID IN A CLOUD. STRUGGLING IN MY FATHER'S HANDS, STRIVING AGAINST MY SWADDLING BANDS. BOUND AND WEARY, I THOUGHT BEST TO SULK UPON MY MOTHERS BREAST." COME OVER HERE. OVER THERE. GO OVER THERE. THEY SENT US TO SCHOOLS WHERE WE MUST GIVE OUR LIVES THAT WE LEAD UNTIL THEN. GO OVER-- GIVE ME THAT. ADULT AS HE MEMORIZES LESSONS THAT LEAVE NO TIME FOR PRESENTS. GIVE IT TO ME. RIGHT NOW. HERE. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. STAY HERE. THANK YOU. "OUT OF THE NOISE OF TIRED PEOPLE WORKING, HARRIED WITH THOUGHTS OF WAR AND LISTS OF DEAD... HIS BEAUTY MET ME LIKE A FRESH WIND BLOWING, CLEAN, BOYISH BEAUTY AND HIGH-HELD HEAD. EYES THAT TOLD SECRETS, LIPS THAT WOULD NOT TELL THEM... FEARLESS AND SHY THE YOUNG UNWEARIED EYES. MEN DIE BY THE MILLIONS NOW, BECAUSE GOD BLUNDERS... YET TO HAVE MADE THIS BOY, HE MUST BE WISE." HOW LONG WAS HE LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I SENT HIM TO TIME OUT. ANSWER THE QUESTION. 30 MINUTES OR THREE HOURS? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, OKAY? I'M TIRED. "IF I SPEAK IN THE TONGUES OF MEN OR OF ANGELS, BUT DO NOT HAVE LOVE, I'M ONLY A RESOUNDING GONG, A CLANGING CYMBAL. IF I HAVE THE GIFT OF PROPHECY AND CAN FATHOM ALL MYSTERIES AND ALL KNOWLEDGE, AND IF I HAVE A FAITH THAT CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS, BUT DO NOT HAVE LOVE, I GAIN NOTHING. IF I GIVE ALL I POSSESS TO POOR..." "AND GIVE OVER MY BODY TO HARDSHIP, THAT I MAY BOAST, BUT DO NOT HAVE LOVE, I GAIN NOTHING. LOVE IS PATIENT. LOVE IS KIND. IT DOES NOT ENVY. IT DOES NOT BOAST. IT IS NOT PROUD. IT DOES NOT DISHONOR OTHERS. IT IS NOT SELF-SEEKING. IT IS NOT EASILY ANGERED. IT KEEPS NO RECORD OF WRONGS.., LOVE DOES NOT DELIGHT IN EVIL, BUT REJOICES WITH THE TRUTH. IT ALWAYS PROTECTS, ALWAYS TRUSTS, ALWAYS HOPES, AND ALWAYS PERSEVERES. LOVE NEVER FAILS. BUT WHERE THERE ARE PROPHECIES, THEY WILL FAIL. WHERE THERE ARE TONGUES, THEY WILL CEASE. WHERE THERE IS KNOWLEDGE, IT WILL VANISH. FOR WE KNOW IN PART WE PROPHESY IN PART BUT WHEN COMPLETENESS COMES, WHAT IS IN PART DISAPPEARS. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I THOUGHT LIKE A CHILD, I REASONED LIKE A CHILD, BUT WHEN I BECAME A MAN, I PUT THE WAYS OF CHILDHOOD BEHIND ME. FOR NOW WE SEE ONLY A REFLECTION, AS IN A MIRROR... THEN WE SHALL SEE FACE TO FACE. NOW I KNOW IN PART, THEN I SHALL KNOW FULLY, EVEN AS I AM FULLY KNOWN." YES! "AND THESE THREE REMAIN: FAITH, HOPE, AND LOVE, BUT THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE." LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED ONE. I DON'T SMOKE. CELIA? CELIA. "COME, MY CELIA, LET US PROVE, WHILE WE CAN, THE SPORTS OF LOVE. TIME WILL NOT BE OURS FOREVER. HE AT LENGTH OUR GOODS WILL SEVER. SPEND NOT THEN HIS GIFTS IN VAIN. SUNS THAT SET MAY RISE AGAIN; BUT IF ONCE WE LOSE THIS LIGHT, 'TIS WITH US PERPETUAL NIGHT. WHY SHOULD WE DEFER OUR JOYS? FAME AND RUMOR ARE BUT TOYS. CANNOT WE DELUDE THE EYES OF A FEW POOR HOUSEHOLD SPIES, OR HIS EASIER EARS BEGUILE, THUS REMOVED BY OUR WILE? 'TIS NO SIN LOVE'S FRUITS TO STEAL, BUT SWEET THEFTS TO REVEAL, TO BE TAKEN, TO BE SEEN, THESE HAVE CRIMES ACCOUNTED BEEN." "IN PEACE, LOVE TUNES THE SHEPHERD'S REED, IN WAR, HE MOUNTS THE WARRIOR'S STEED. IN HALLS, IN GAY ATTIRE IS SEEN. IN HAMLETS, DANCES ON THE GREEN. LOVE RULES THE COURT, THE CAMP, THE GROVE, AND MEN BELOW, AND SAINTS ABOVE, FOR LOVE IS HEAVEN, AND HEAVEN IS LOVE." MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? THIS IS THE FIRST BOARDING CALL FOR THE 3:00 BUS GOING TO LOS ANGELES. PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKET READY TO PRESENT TO YOUR DRIVER AT GATE FOUR. "NEVER SEEK TO TELL THY LOVE LOVE THAT NEVER TOLD CAN BE. FOR THE GENTLE WIND DOES MOVE SILENTLY, INVISIBLY. I TOLD MY LOVE, I TOLD MY LOVE, I TOLD HER ALL MY HEART TREMBLING COLD IN GHASTLY FEARS. AH, SHE DID DEPART. AS SOON AS SHE WAS GONE FROM ME A TRAVELER CAME BY. SILENTLY, INVISIBLY, HE TOOK HER WITH A SIGH." I LOVE YOU MORE THAN MOMMY. HE'S NOT HOME. MMM. DID YOU SEE HER WITH DADDY TONIGHT? NO? NO? WHAT'S HIS NAME? HE'S SO CUTE. SHH... "WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY HOW MY NAME HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH PLAUDITS IN THE CAPITOL, STILL IT WAS NOT A HAPPY NIGHT FOR ME THAT FOLLOWED, AND ELSE WHEN I CAROUSED, OR WHEN MY PLANS WERE ACCOMPLISHED, STILL I WAS NOT HAPPY." IT'S REALLY HAPPENING. "BUT THE DAY WHEN I ROSE AT DAWN FROM THE BED OF PERFECT HEALTH, REFRESHED, SINGING, INHALING THE RIPE BREATH OF AUTUMN, WHEN I SAW THE FULL MOON IN THE WEST GROW PALE AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE MORNING LIGHT, WHEN I WANDERED ALONE OVER THE BEACH, AND UNDRESSING BATHED, LAUGHING WITH THE COOL WATERS, AND SAW THE SUN RISE, AND WHEN I THOUGHT HOW MY DEAR FRIEND, MY LOVER, WAS ON HIS WAY COMING, O, THEN I WAS HAPPY. O THEN EACH BREATH TASTED SWEETER, AND ALL THAT DAY MY FOOD NOURISHED ME MORE, AND THE BEAUTIFUL DAY PASSED WELL, AND THE NEXT CAME WITH EQUAL JOY, AND WITH THE NEXT AT EVENING CAME MY FRIEND. AND THAT NIGHT WHILE ALL WAS STILL I HEARD THE WATERS ROLL SLOWLY CONTINUALLY UP THE SHORES. I HEARD THE HISSING RUSTLE OF THE LIQUID AND SANDS AS DIRECTED TO ME WHISPERING TO CONGRATULATE ME, FOR THE ONE I LOVE MOST LAY SLEEPING BY ME UNDER THE SAME COVER IN THE COOL NIGHT, IN THE STILLNESS IN THE AUTUMN MOONBEAMS. HIS FACE WAS INCLINED TOWARD ME, AND HIS ARM LAY LIGHTLY AROUND MY BREAST-- AND THAT NIGHT I WAS HAPPY." I WANT TO GO WITH THE ONE I LOVE. I DO NOT WANT TO CALCULATE THE COST. I DO NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOOD. I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHETHER HE LOVES ME. I WANT TO GO WITH WHOM I LOVE. MY FRIEND... NEW YORK IS NO PLACE FOR A KID THAT YOUNG, NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER. YOU'LL SEE HIM IN EIGHT WEEKS. GO. I SAID, "I WANT A LOVER." GOD SAID, "GO WITHOUT. LEARN TO LOVE YOUR FRIENDS. THEY NEED YOU." I SAID, "IT'S ABOUT TIME I WAS FAMOUS." GOD SAID, "WHAT IS FAME ANYWAY? I SAID, "I WANT A LOVER." GOD SAID, "HERE'S A PUG. CALL HIM ROMEO." I SAID, "WHAT ABOUT ACTING CREDITS?" GOD SAID, "I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE LESSONS." I SAID, "BUT I WANT TO BE IN MOVIES." GOD SAID, "AWESOME. HERE'S A CAMERA." "I REALLY NEED A LOVER," I EXPLAINED. "YOU SEE, MY HEART IS BROKEN." GOD SAID, "MINE, TOO." I SAID, "CAN I AT LEAST BE HAPPY WITH JUST WHAT I HAVE?" GOD SAID, "UP TO YOU." I SAID, "I STILL WANT A LOVER." GOD SAID, "ENOUGH ALREADY. I DON'T EVEN GET TO MAKE OUT WITH ANYTHING. THE MOON IS FRIGID. THE SUN'S HIGH MAINTENANCE. IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS TO HUG SATURN WITH ALL THOSE RINGS, AND, TECHNICALLY, EVEN THE FARTHERST GALAXY FROM THE MILKY WAY IS STILL ME. IF I CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT A LOVER, SO CAN YOU." SOMETHING ABOUT GOD NOT HAVING A LOVER SHOOK ME TO THE CORE, AND I STARTED TO CRY. GOD TRIED TO GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE AND MADE SILLY, STUPID FACES, BUT I WASN'T IN THE MOOD. I SAID, "I CAN'T HELP IT. I'M STILL HOPING TO FIND LOVE." GOD SAID, "NOW YOU'RE TALKING." TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON, AND A TIME TO EVERY PURPOSE UNDER HEAVEN. A TIME TO BE BORN, AND A TIME TO DIE; A TIME TO PLANT, AND A TIME TO PLUCK UP THAT WHICH IS PLANTED, A TIME TO KILL, A TIME TO HEAL, A TIME TO BREAK DOWN, AND A TIME TO BUILD UP, A TIME TO WEEP, AND A TIME TO LAUGH. A TIME TO MOURN, AND A TIME TO DANCE. A TIME TO CAST AWAY STONES, AND A TIME TO GATHER STONES TOGETHER... A TIME TO EMBRACE, AND A TIME TO REFRAIN FROM EMBRACING. A TIME TO GET, AND A TIME TO LOSE. A TIME TO KEEP, AND A TIME TO CAST AWAY, A TIME TO REND, AND A TIME TO SEW. A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE... AND A TIME TO SPEAK; A TIME TO LOVE, AND A TIME TO HATE, A TIME OF WAR, AND A TIME OF PEACE. HI. THIS IS FOR ALL THE CHILDREN. WE ARE INVITING ALL THE CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE TO COME AND STAY WITH US. MEET MY BEST FRIEND. - HI. - HELLO. WHERE ARE WE GOING? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN WITH SO MANY FRIENDS. LET'S GO. OKAY, WHOEVER DOESN'T COME IS GOING TO MISS THE FUN. ALL RIGHT, BYE, OH, YOU'RE HERE. HEY, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARY. WHAT? STOP IT. I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. ME TOO, MOMMY, LET ME OUT. MOMMY, LET ME OUT! MOMMY, LET ME OUT! PEOPLE-- YOU TRY. "I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD THAT FLOATS ON HIGH OVER VALES AND HILLS... WHEN ALL AT ONCE I SAW A CROWD... A HOST OF GOLDEN DAFFODILS, BESIDE THE LAKE, BENEATH THE TREES, FLUTTERING AND DANCING IN THE BREEZE, CONTINUOUS AS THE STARS THAT SHINE AND TWINKLE IN THE MILKY WAY, THEY STRETCHED IN NEVER-ENDING LINE ALONG THE MARGIN OF A BAY-- TEN THOUSAND SAW I AT A GLANCE, TOSSING THEIR HEADS IN SPRIGHTLY DANCE. THE WAVES BESIDE THEM DANCED, BUT THEY OUT-DID THE SPARKLING WAVES IN GLEE. A POET COULD NOT BUT BE GAY IN SUCH A JOCUND COMPANY. I GAZED... AND GAZED... BUT LITTLE THOUGHT WHAT WEALTH TO ME THE SHOW HAD BROUGHT. FOR OFT, ON MY COUCH WHEN I LIE IN VACANT OR PENSIVE MOOD, THEY FLASH UPON THE INWARD EYE WHICH IS THE BLISS OF SOLITUDE AND THEN MY HEART WITH PLEASURE FILLS, AND DANCES WITH THE DAFFODILS." "WILL NO ONE TELL ME WHAT SHE SINGS? THE VALE PROFOUND IS OVERFLOWING WITH THE SOUND. MOMMY! LET ME OUT! BEHOLD HER, SINGLE IN THE FIELD, YON SOLITARY HIGHLAND LASS, REAPING AND SINGING BY HERSELF, STOP HERE, OR GENTLY PASS. ALONE SHE CUTS AND BINDS THE GRAIN, AND SINGS A MELANCHOLY STRAIN. O LISTEN! FOR THE VALE PROFOUND IS OVERFLOWING WITH THE SOUND. MOMMY! LET ME OUT! NO NIGHTINGALE DID EVER CHANT MORE WELCOME NOTES TO WEARY BANDS OF TRAVELERS IN SOME SHADY HAUNT, AMONG ARABIAN SANDS. A VOICE SO THRILLING NEVER WAS HEARD IN SPRINGTIME FROM THE CUCKOO BIRD, BREAKING THE SILENCE OF THE SEAS AMONG THE FARTHEST HEBRIDES. WILL NO ONE TELL ME WHAT SHE SINGS? AND PERHAPS THE PLAINTIVE NUMBERS FLOW FOR OLD, UNHAPPY, FAR OFF THINGS, AND BATTLES LONG AGO, OR IS IT SOME MORE HUMBLE LAY, FAMILIAR MATTER OF TODAY? SOME NATURAL SORROW, LOSS, OR PAIN, THAT HAS BEEN, AND MAY BE AGAIN? WHATEVER THE THEME, THE MAIDEN SANG AS IF HER SONG COULD HAVE NO ENDING. I SAW HER SINGING AT HER WORK, AND OVER THE SICKLE BENDING. I LISTENED, MOTIONLESS AND STILL, AND AS I MOUNTED UP THE HILL, THE MUSIC IN MY HEART I BORE, LONG AFTER IT WAS HEARD NO MORE." "WHEN YOU HAVE TIDIED ALL THINGS FOR THE NIGHT, AND WHILE YOUR THOUGHTS ARE FADING TO THEIR SLEEP, YOU'LL PAUSE A MOMENT IN THE LATE FIRELIGHT, TOO SORROWFUL TO WEEP. THE LARGE AND GENTLE FURNITURE HAS STOOD IN SYMPATHETIC SILENCE ALL THE DAY WITH THAT OLD KINDNESS OF DOMESTIC WOOD. NEVERTHELESS THE HAUNTED ROOM WILL SAY, 'SOMEONE MUST BE AWAY.' THE LITTLE DOG ROLLS OVER HALF AWAKE, STRETCHES HIS PAWS, YAWNS, LOOKING UP AT YOU, WAGS HIS TAIL VERY SLIGHTLY FOR YOUR SAKE, THAT YOU MAY FEEL HE IS UNHAPPY TOO. A DISTANT ENGINE WHISTLES, OR THE FLOOR CREAKS, OR THE WANDERING NIGHT WIND BANGS A DOOR. SILENCE IS SCATTERED LIKE A BROKEN GLASS. THE MINUTES PRICK THEIR EARS AND RUN ABOUT, THEN ONE BY ONE SUBSIDE AGAIN AND PASS SEDATELY IN, MONOTONOUSLY OUT. YOU BEND YOUR HEAD AND WIPE AWAY A TEAR, AND SOLITUDE TAKES ONE HEAVY STEP MORE NEAR." "I'LL KEEP A LITTLE TAVERN BELOW THE HIGH HILL'S CREST, WHEREIN ALL GREY-EYED PEOPLE MAY SET THEM DOWN AND REST. THERE SHALL BE PLATES A-PLENTY, AND MUGS-- AND MUGS TO MELT THE CHILL OF ALL THE GREY-EYED PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN UP THE HILL. THERE SOUND WILL SLEEP THE TRAVELER, AND DREAM HIS JOURNEY'S END, BUT I WILL ROUSE AT MIDNIGHT THE FALLING FIRE TO TEND. AYE, 'TIS A CURIOUS FANCY- AYE... BUT ALL THE GOOD I KNOW AYE, 'TIS A CURIOUS FANCY-- WAS TAUGHT ME OUT OF TWO GREY EYES BUT ALL THE GOOD I KNOW WAS TAUGHT ME OUT OF TWO GREY EYES A LONG TIME AGO." "DEAR BENJAMIN... AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I FINALLY CREATED SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING ORIGINAL. FORGIVE ME. AMAYA." "AND THE SON ON THE BACK PORCH, HE PLACES THE INFANT AGAINST HIS BODY, HIS BROAD CHEST DEVELOPED FROM HIS DELIVERY JOB. NOT IN HER PARENTS' ARMS, SHE CRIES. MY GRANDFATHER RESTS HER HEAD ON HIS COLLARBONE, SIDESTEPS BACK AND FORTH AND SINGS THE SONG 'PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER.' AN UNSELFCONSCIOUS SINGER WITH A LARGE AUDIENCE AND ONLY ONE CRITIC-- HER. I WITNESS THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN, MY GRANDFATHER AROUND INFANTS. AND WHEN HE HELD MY NEPHEW AND SANG HIS STANDARD BALLAD, IT OCCURRED TO ME... HE MUST'VE DONE IT TO ME AS WELL. SEE, I MUST'VE BEEN IN HIS ARMS, BODY AGAINST HIS CHEST, HEAD IN THE CROOK OF HIS NECK. I LIKE TO THINK HIS SINGING SOOTHED ME... THAT I DIDN'T CRY. I THINK OF HIM DANCING AND HOLDING MY BODY BEFORE MY PARENTS HURT ME.,. HIM HOLDING ME AT THE ONLY TIME I CAN REFLECT UPON AS INNOCENT. SEE, HE KNEW ME WHEN I WAS UNAFFECTED,.. AND WHISPERED IN MY EAR, "BABY." "MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME? WHY ART THOU SO FAR FROM HELPING ME, AND FROM THE WORDS OF MY ROARING?" "OH, MY GOD, I CRY IN THE DAY TIME, BUT THOU HEAREST NOT, AND IN THE NIGHT SEASON, AND AM NOT SILENT. MY STRENGTH IS DRIED UP LIKE A POTSHERD, AND MY TONGUE CLEAVETH TO MY JAW, AND THOU HAST BROUGHT ME INTO THE DUST OF DEATH." "MY TALE WAS HEARD AND YET IT WAS NOT TOLD, MY FRUIT IS FALLEN, YET MY LEAVES ARE GREEN, MY YOUTH IS SPENT AND YET I AM NOT OLD, I SAW THE WORLD AND YET I WAS NOT SEEN, MY THREAD IS CUT AND YET IT IS NOT SPUN, AND NOW I LIVE, AND NOW MY LIFE IS DONE." "IN VAIN TO ME, THE SMILING MORNINGS SHINE. MY LONELY ANGUISH MELTS NO HEART BUT MINE, AND IN MY BREAST THE IMPERFECT JOYS EXPIRE. YET MORNING SMILES THE BUSY RACE TO CHEER, AND NEW-BORN PLEASURE BRINGS TO HAPPIER MEN, THE FIELDS TO ALL THEIR WONTED TRIBUTES BEAR, TO WARM THEIR LITTLE LOVES THE BIRDS COMPLAIN, I FRUITLESS MOURN TO HIM THAT CANNOT HEAR... AND WEEP THE MORE BECAUSE I WEEP IN VAIN." "SUCCESS IS COUNTED SWEETEST BY THOSE WHO NEVER SUCCEED. TO COMPREHEND A NECTAR REQUIRES SOREST NEED. NOT ONE OF ALL THE PURPLE HOST WHO TOOK THE FLAG TODAY CAN TELL THE DEFINITION SO CLEAR OF VICTORY... AS HE DEFEATED--DYING-- ON WHOSE FORBIDDEN EAR THE DISTANT STRAINS OF TRIUMPH BREAK AGONIZED AND CLEAR." "LISTEN, CHILDREN-- YOUR FATHER IS DEAD. FROM HIS OLD COATS I'LL MAKE YOU LITTLE JACKETS, I'LL MAKE YOU LITTLE TROUSERS FROM HIS OLD PANTS. THERE'LL BE IN HIS POCKETS THINGS HE USED TO PUT THERE, KEYS AND PENNIES COVERED WITH TOBACCO. DAN SHALL HAVE THE PENNIES TO SAVE IN HIS BANK. ANNE SHALL HAVE THE KEYS TO MAKE A PRETTY NOISE WITH. LIFE MUST GO ON... THOUGH GOOD MEN DIE." A BLACK CROW KNOWS HIS END FROM INTERTINGLINGS AND TWITCHES MADE PRONOUNCED BY HIS LIGHT FRAME. MOST, WHEN THEY SENSE THIS INEVITABLE DEATH, WHIMPER AWAY TO SECURE A FEW MORE SHALLOW BREATHS, A COMFORT PAIN WITH DIRT. SO IMAGINE THE CURIOUS TWITTER OF NATURE WHEN THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW RECOGNIZED THE BEGINNING OF HIS OWN DECAY AND USED UP HIS REMAINING STRENGTH TO MOUNT A FALLEN SCARECROW LONG FORGOTTEN. CLUTCHING THE OVERSIZED BUTTONS ONCE USED FOR EYES, HE SECURED HIMSELF A VIEW OF THE GRASSY FIELDS AND SURROUNDING FORESTS. HE'D BEEN SCAVENGING HIS ENTIRE LIFE. FOR THE FIRST TIME... HE NOTICED THE CHASE ALL AROUND OF PREDATOR TO PREY... OF MATE TO POTENTIAL MATE THE YOUNG TO ITS MOTHER. HE NOTICED WITHOUT CONCERN FOR HIS OWN SURVIVAL. THEN HE DID SOMETHING MOST UNUSUAL INDEED. HE UNHOOKED HIS TIRED WINGS, ALLOWING THEM TO DROOP TO EITHER SIDE, AND LET OUT HIS UGLY VOICE. HIS UGLY VOICE REIGNED OVER THE TWITTERS OF NATURE. THE UNCOMFORTABLE MINUTES OF AWKWARD, DYING MOANS, PROVOKED SOMETHING LIKE... CURIOSITY AMONG THE REST BEFORE OPPORTUNISTIC HAWKS SWOOPED DOWN WITH BLOODLESS ATTACK ENDED THE SUFFERING OF THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW. THE CHASE CONTINUED, PREDATOR TO PREY, MATE TO POTENTIAL MATE, YOUNG TO ITS MOTHER. AH, THE CHASE. BUT THE SENSE OF THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW ALTERED SOME OF ITS PARTICIPANTS IN A WAY TOO MYSTERIOUS TO UNDERSTAND. IF YOU NEED TO, GO AHEAD. YOU SHOULD KNOW SOME THINGS... ABOUT HOW WE WORK IN THERE. I KNOW. "BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT, FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. BLESSED ARE THEY WHO MOURN, FOR THEY WILL BE COMFORTED. BLESSED ARE THE MEEK, FOR THEY WILL INHERIT THE EARTH. BLESSED ARE THEY WHO HUNGER AND THIRST AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS, FOR THEY SHALL BE FILLED. BLESSED ARE THE MERCIFUL, FOR THEY SHALL RECEIVE MERCY. BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART, FOR THEY WILL SEE GOD. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS, FOR THEY WILL BE CALLED THE CHILDREN OF GOD. BLESSED ARE THEY WHICH ARE PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE, FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN." TO FIGHT ALOUD, IS VERY BRAVE, BUT GALLANTER, I KNOW WHO CHARGE WITHIN THE BOSOM THE CAVALRY OF WOE, WHO WIN, AND NATIONS DO NOT SEE, WHO FALL, AND NONE OBSERVE, WHOSE DYING EYES, NO COUNTRY REGARDS WITH PATRIOT LOVE. WE TRUST, IN PLUMED PROCESSION FOR SUCH, THE ANGELS GO, RANK AFTER RANK, WITH EVEN FEET AND UNIFORMS OF SNOW." "POETS TO COME! ORATORS, SINGERS, MUSICIANS TO COME! NOT TODAY IS TO JUSTIFY ME, AND ANSWER WHAT I AM FOR, BUT YOU, A NEW BROOD, NATIVE, ATHLETIC, CONTINENTAL, GREATER THAN BEFORE KNOWN, AROUSE! FOR YOU MUST JUSTIFY ME. I MYSELF BUT WRITE ONE OR TWO INDICATIVE WORDS FOR THE FUTURE, I BUT ADVANCE A MOMENT, ONLY TO WHEEL AND HURRY BACK IN THE DARKNESS. I AM A MAN WHO, SAUNTERING ALONG, WITHOUT FULLY STOPPING, TURNS A CASUAL LOOK UPON YOU, AND THEN AVERTS HIS FACE, LEAVING IT TO YOU TO PROVE AND DEFINE IT... EXPECTING THE MAIN THINGS FROM YOU." "HAD I THE HEAVENS' EMBROIDERED CLOTHS, ENWROUGHT WITH GOLDEN AND SILVER LIGHT, THE BLUE AND THE DIM AND THE DARK CLOTHS OF NIGHT AND LIGHT AND THE HALF-LIGHT, I WOULD SPREAD THE CLOTHS UNDER YOUR FEET. BUT I, BEING POOR, HAVE ONLY MY DREAMS, I HAVE SPREAD MY DREAMS UNDER YOUR FEET. TREAD SOFTLY BECAUSE YOU TREAD ON MY DREAMS." "NOW ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT, BE SECRET AND TAKE DEFEAT FROM ANY BRAZEN THROAT, FOR HOW CAN YOU COMPETE, BEING HONOR BRED, WITH ONE WHO WERE IT PROVED HE LIES WERE NEITHER SHAMED IN HIS OWN NOR IN HIS NEIGHBORS' EYES, BRED TO A HARDER THING THAN TRIUMPH, TURN AWAY AND LIKE A LAUGHING STRING WHEREON MAD FINGERS PLAY AMID A PLACE OF STONE, BE SECRET AND EXULT, BECAUSE OF ALL THINGS KNOWN THAT IS MOST DIFFICULT." HI. WHERE'S ZANE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BENJAMIN CALLED ME. WHERE IS HE? HE'S HERE. HE'S RIGHT HERE. RIGHT WHERE? COME HERE. COME. HE'S RIGHT HERE. YOU SEE? IF YOU NEED TO, GO AHEAD. YOU SHOULD KNOW SOME THINGS ABOUT HOW WE WORK IN THERE. I KNOW. YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T. WAS IT BAD? YES. DOES HE SUFFER? YES. DID YOU-- DID YOU GET LONELY? YES. YOU MADE ART FOR HIM. I'M ON MEDICATION NOW. I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT PILLS. WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN? "LET IT BE FORGOTTEN, AS A FLOWER IS FORGOTTEN, FORGOTTEN AS A FIRE THAT WAS ONCE SINGING GOLD. LET IT BE FORGOTTEN FOR EVER AND EVER... TIME IS A KIND FRIEND, HE WILL MAKE US OLD. IF ANYONE ASKS, SAY IT WAS FORGOTTEN LONG AND LONG AGO... AS A FLOWER... AS A FIRE... AS A HUSHED FOOTFALL IN A LONG FORGOTTEN SNOW." TONIGHT WE GO ON A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME, FROM YOUTH TO LOVE TO DEATH AND BEYOND. YOU'LL HEAR 32 POEMS, SELECTIONS FROM THE BIBLE TO BLAKE TO MODERN-DAY POETS LIVING RIGHT HERE IN LOS ANGELES. SOME OF YOU MAY THINK MEN BELONG IN THE OFFICE OR IN A BALLPARK OR EVEN IN A PRISON CELL. WE HAPPEN TO THINK THAT REAL MEN READ POETRY. WELCOME TO "GUYS READING POEMS." "THERE SOUND WILL SLEEP THE TRAVELER AND DREAM HIS JOURNEY'S END." "BRED TO A HARDER THING THAN TRIUMPH, TURN AWAY AND LIKE A LAUGHING STRING WHEREON MAD FINGERS PLAY AMID A PLACE OF STONE, BE SECRET AND EXULT." "A TIME TO BREAK DOWN AND A TIME TO BUILD UP.., A TIME TO WEEP.,. AND A TIME TO LAUGH." "I THINK OF HIM DANCING AND HOLDING MY BODY... BEFORE MY PARENTS HURT ME... HIM HOLDING ME AT THE ONLY TIME I CAN REFLECT UPON AS INNOCENT." "EXPECTING THE MAIN THINGS FROM YOU." BLESSED ARE THEY WHO ARE PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE, FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. HE HAD A LARGE STACK OF MEMORIAL CARDS, HANDED FROM FUNERALS. FRIENDS AND LOVERS STOLEN BY AIDS. I HAD JOKED ONCE THAT... HE MIGHT NEED A RECIPE BOX TO CATEGORIZE AND ALPHABETIZE... THE MOUNTAIN STACK. HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "THAT'S NOT HOW RECIPE BOXES ARE ORGANIZED," HE SAID. "THEY WERE ORGANIZED BY COURSE." GREAT. NOW I HAVE TO DECIDE WHO'S AN ENTREE, DESSERT, AN HORS D'OEUVRE." SO HE BEGAN TO... SHOUT OUT THE NAMES OF HIS FRIENDS. AND WHERE HE WOULD PLACE THEM. JOSE, ENTREE. MICHAEL... HORS D'OEUVRE. SUSAN... HORS D'OEUVRE. JOEY... ENTREE. JONATHAN... HORS D'OEUVRE. ALEX... HORS D'OEUVRE, AND FOR HIS LAST LOVER, RAMON... DESSERT. GO AHEAD.
