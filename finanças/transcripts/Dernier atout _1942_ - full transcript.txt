The action of the movie is set in Carical, the capital of an imaginary country. CROSSWORDS -One hundred pesos on Montes. -How much do you say? -One hundred. -All right. -So. -Great? SHOOTING PRACTICE Your turn, Mr. Clarence. Your turn, man. No more bets? Bets have all been made? Well, then I will do mine. -What a great shooting contest. -It is a close one. It is not that close. It will be Montes. -Not so sure. -I am telling you. -What do you know? -Wouldn't you choose Clarence? -Oh, no. -Here he is. We were just talking about you. So, are you happy? -I think I did well. -Think you will win? May the best one win. You say that when you think you are the best. -What would you like to drink? -Whiskey. -A well-drawn half. -You think you are Clarence. -What a mess of a loudspeaker. -This one? -Hi, Major. -Not so fast. -Clarence did not beat you, did he? -I don't know, he shot well. It's his gun that shoots. Here, some dictionaries. Admit that I am as sweet as pie. And as spiritual as a whale. Bring us some whiskey. Hurry up, Gonzales is coming for the major. Here is Gonzales! Set up for the quadrille. Major! Silence! A moment of silence, please. PROVISIONAL INSTRUCTOR Very funny. Why "provisional instructor"? You will replace our regular instructor who is ill. If I replace him, that makes me an instructor. Erase this insolent inscription. All right, erase it. I have some interesting news to tell you. The first… There is no first. More precisely, there are two. Silence, please. This has never happened before. Let this incident be a lesson to you. A police officer should expect anything. Silence! Mister Clarence. Mister Montes. I have called you both in alphabetical order. Please, follow me. Well, I hope Montes becomes a major. -What? -I hope Montes becomes major. What do you care? Mr. Clarence annoys me with his tie and crosswords. Rosita, connect the boss's phone on the loudspeaker. -We will announce the results. -Done. Thank you very much. Two firsts. What do you think? It does not bother me. It does not bother you because you have not been there. These gentlemen and I are attached to traditions. -Do you mind? -Sure, if you like. What are the solutions? Montes has an excellent idea. Well, sir. This may be a bit bold, but you will tell me the rules… I mean, Clarence and I had thought that… What? We need to end this. Your fellows below, what do they say? This is Toma. What method did you use to send me two winners? No one shall leave before Mr. Montes has managed to explain his idea to me. -This promises to be long. -That is a leader. -For Toma, hip hip… -Hooray! Listen, sir, there is only one way. A decision should be made after another test. Is that all you came up with? Allow me, sir. I mean a special test, something brand new. I mean a practical test. Look at that. For example? For example… A crime. CUSTOMS Is that all you have? What about this? We will not clear this bag. -Will you leave it in the locker? -Certainly. -Porter? -Madam? Do what is necessary and return the bulletin. Yes, madam. Sir, madam. Go see if Ms. Morgan is there. You can tell her I already called her this morning. Ms. Morgan, it is the broker in the coat who called this morning. Have him call again later. I am not here at the moment. I am going to suggest… Ah, I'm sorry. Mr. and Mrs. Collins? Your apartment has been booked. We received a call… two days ago in the morning, right? -Two days ago. -Yes, two days ago. It is Collins, correct? That is right. Mr. and Mrs. Collins of Péréna. Yes, that is right. Apartment 275. Chasset. -Yes? -Two hundred and seventy-five. He is beginning to understand that we are interested in him. I have been waiting for four days for them pretending to sell dresses. I expected you sooner. I arrived slowly, as a tourist on Martinez's yacht. -You were wasting time. -I was gaining trust. Martinez has a passport. He's an honorable character. He dropped me off where I needed to be. His yacht is in the harbor, ready to pick us up when needed. -You have a complaint? -No, Rudy. No proper names. It may be dangerous to stay here, but where do we go? -Should I go upstairs or not? -Why go upstairs? You have an ambassador up there. Of course. But it would amuse me. I am going upstairs. That is ridiculous. I am not going upstairs. Aren't you getting on the elevator? Is your room next to his? Obviously, 276. Eavesdrop and let me know. -That is why I am here. -Certainly not to sell dresses. By the way… How is everything? Bad or very bad? It must be going very badly if I'm doing this. We do what we can. -Get out. -As you wish. Wallace? Hello. It did not take long. Did you get him? We will get you too, if you talk. Where is the money? -What money? -Don't be silly. I know nothing about it. As you wish. Do you know what you are risking? Let me go. No. You will wait for the police. Hold your tongue when you're questioned. Hello? This is Room 275. Quick! We need a doctor. The doctor was requested for Room 275. -How did it go? -It was a dud. Wallace fired the gun. The fool. It will cost him. Too bad, I would have liked to talk to him. -It is difficult. -Did you sound the alarm? -Not yet. -Do it. -Are you crazy? -I want someone there. -Why? -I want my money. -How? -He stole it from me. I want it back. I should give it to the poor. As you wish. Have a good evening. -Tell me. -I am sorry. Is the room next to mine occupied? Room 275, yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs. Collins. Why? -Things are a bit noisy over there. -Really! Yes! They did not stop. Installation, suitcase, argument. -Don't make a big deal of it. -Please. I would not want Room 276 to be disturbed under the pretext that Room 275… Does not answer. Oh yes, it does. Hello? Hello, Room 275? What? How? Is that you, doctor? What? Call the police, why? A crime? I… I will send the hotel detective. What do we do with this? You will empty his pockets and throw him into the river. -But first, take me to my place. -All right. So, last composition? Practical test. The boss was generous. Correct. As long as it isn't lousy, right? Lousy? In a palace? A luxurious crime, man. -Sorry, I passed. -Go ahead. Please. -Do you have any information? -What is going on? Talk to Detective Gonzales. He is on duty. He is waiting for our report and that of the investigators. Do not bother. Well. You will figure it out soon, we have made others talk. Officer candidates Montes and Clarence of the Special Brigade. Pleased to meet you. Pérez, hotel detective. Nothing to get from her. She knows nothing and has seen or heard nothing. Locked in the bathroom, entered the room, and saw her injured husband on the carpet. That's all there is to it. This is Clarence. Yes? Yes. Oh, thank you. It's José. He is calling from the clinic. He says the bullet was extracted. He'll send the report as soon as possible. By the way, your husband is dead. This reflex does not deceive. Here is a woman who killed her husband and does not want to tell us. Is that your impression? I could be wrong, sir, but I would be surprised. Not me. You were wired Chicago to verify the identities? -No further questions? -No, thank you. The gun? -What prints? -There are two guns. The one found on the victim which bears his fingerprints. No bullets were fired from this weapon. As for the pistol found near the man, there were no fingerprints. This is significant. I am going to the technical department to check if the bullet came from this gun. Perfect. What is this new development? We charge the officer candidates with criminal investigations? It's Toma's idea. Do not try to understand. Good, old Toma. Good evening. Madam, please speak. You understand that this silence is dangerous for you. Montes? Excuse me. What is the lady's first name? Catherine, why? Nothing. Just wanted to know. I admit that this is not a crime of passion and that you didn't shoot. Right. So… Did your husband have any enemies? Do you know any of them? What were you doing here from Chicago? Mister… Collins was in business? Was he involved in politics? Music? Literature? No. How long have you been married? How long have you been married? Do you have children? No, she cannot have any. My friend, there is nothing to do. Did you find anything? Yes. Candy and jewelry. I do not know much about it, but still. Tell me about these pearls. Pearls always have a story. Right? They may be fake. Yes, these are definitely fake. That is a shame. Too bad for you. If they were real, right? What a fuss. I give up, man. Try, if you please. Here. It's more pleasant. Candy? Thank you. She has spoken, so she is not mute. You never knew how to talk to women. -They are not poisoned, right? -You never know. She spoke again because she is not afraid anymore. She was afraid. Put yourself in her shoes. You do not want to say who you were afraid of? Well, that is a shame. I apologize, but I am going to ask you a sensitive question. There was talk of a crime of passion. -So, you were jealous? -No, I was not. You see? -This is not a crime of passion. -There is something else. -Tell us what you know. -I do not know anything. I do not know anything! Let me rest. I want to sleep. -Are we resting? -There are two of you. Is it so tiring to say nothing? Fortunately, they are not all like you. Hello? Management, please. Tell me, sir, am I in Room 275? Okay. Who do you have in Room 274? No one. What about 276? Ms. Morgan from Chicago. Could you put me through? Hello, yes? I am sorry? No, I was sleeping, but it does not matter. Right now? If it is necessary. Well, let put on my robe and I will be there. This American seamstress… She gave the alert after the murder. Yeah, I know. While I interrogate her, you could take a look in her room. What do you think? Not bad. Isn't it? If it does not work out, call me. -All right. -All right. Doesn't it bother you? Come in. Sorry to bother you, but it is necessary. I do not know if I could be of any help. I am terribly shaken. -See you soon. -See you soon. Please, sit down. So… What do you know? Nothing. I was getting dressed for dinner when I heard madam and her husband. I mean, the couple was settling down. Immediately, there was an argument. You were listening? I could hear it, and it bothered me. I hate putting makeup on when there is noise next door. What exactly did you hear? A man and a woman's voice. The woman's voice especially. The woman voice was raised and she sounded furious. Then at the end, a bang. In short, a quarrel? The lady cried and the gentleman screamed. So in the end, she killed him. Crime of passion. We are not interested in that at all. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Mr. Director. It is done. Ms. Morgan is there. We are interrogating her. You are very kind. Nothing special here. How are you doing? All right. Can I go back? Thank you, Mr. Director. Everything is fine. Excuse me. -Is that all you wanted to know? -Well, yes. -Can I go back to my room? -Yes, you can. Do you mind? One more second. Mrs. Collins, come here for a moment, please. Did you know each other before tonight? -No. -Yes! I mean… We had seen each other in the hall. That is what I meant to say. Can I go back to my seat? -No more questions, Montes? -Huh? No. You can go back to your seat. Do you still need me? You knew very little about each other. Pretty much, like you and me. Not even. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, madam. Have a good evening. None of this tells us much. Never despair. Never despair. Still no report from the officer candidates. What are they doing? I will have to go and see for myself. -Are you coming? -Give them a chance. -It may be complicated. -Complicated? You will see it. Hello? If the boss asks for me, I am in Babylon. All right. What is it? Excuse me. Were you sleeping? That is okay. Do you need anything? Yes, your name. -Bella. -Thank you. Good evening. Excuse me. DEPOSIT SLIP FOR CARICAL FERRY TERMINAL SUITCASES: ONE -For you. -Very good. It is just the two of you. I will get a sandwich. -Time goes by slowly. -Make it quick. Thank you. Do you mind? Oh yes… you may be interested in this. No, she is not interested. The bullet that killed Collins was fired by your… By the gun found here. We suspected it, didn't we? And this… A response from Chicago. "In response to your request for information regarding… Mr. Collins in New York… on 320th Michigan Boulevard." "We can confirm with absolute certainty..." "That there is no Collins at the address listed." Exactly. That is the way to go. It is just that, you could have started earlier. So, friends? Well, I will not insist. And two… let's see the third one. Forensic identification. In other words, these are the prints. We will know everything. IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE PRINTS OF THE DEAD MAN. SCARS FROM DEEP BURNS ON ALL THE FINGERTIPS OF THE RIGHT HAND AND THE INDEX FINGER AND THUMB OF THE LEFT HAND. "Despite superficial burns, we were able to identify the victim's fingerprints." "They are undeniably those of…" And there you have it. You couldn't tell me? Happy now? -No. -What else do you need? I want to know who you are. Her friend, of course. Pearls. Doesn't that tell you something? Do you ever read newspapers in your country? Are you Pearls? The pearl woman? It cannot be. So, he is… he is Amanyto! America's public enemy number one. -I cannot believe it. -But… how… You didn't know? Well done. -Can I go to sleep? -No. You forgot why I am here. You would like to know who killed him. I would give ten years of my life to know that. Or mine rather? I killed him. You confess. It is about time I got here. -Do you mind? -I do, actually. I have allowed too much by giving you the reins. What about Clarence? Where is he? -I do not know. -Tired? Did he go to sleep? Two years of study to get here. Let's get back to the point. This Collins, what happened? It was Tony Amanyto. Tony Amanyto, the American bandit? Rudy Score's partner? Exactly. You are under arrest. Take her away, Roberto. I am not used to disturbing you like this, but that is what this is all about. Tony Amanyto, America's public enemy number one arrived from Péréna. I did not know it. He stayed at the Hotel Babylon, I did not know it. He came to die in our country without us knowing about it. Neither you, district leaders, nor I knew. In conclusion, you are not doing your job. That is all. You may leave. What do you want? Discharge of the officer candidates. The question of major is settled. They can go on vacation. Well. Who is the major after all? Clarence? No, he went to bed before the end. It was a bit large-scaled for beginners. So, is it Montes? Yes, it seems like it. So, now that the students are out, the Babylon case is now yours. Do what is necessary. Prepare the file for the investigating magistrate. You can count on me, boss. How much? One peso. I asked about the fabric business. There's no interest. There are even risks. I give up. Stay if you like, I understand. You are very careful today. You will end up getting me worried. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, my friend. -Can I take those for you? -No, I am fine. Something new is happening. I will call you back. -Good afternoon, police officer. -Good afternoon, my lovely suspect. -Is that so? -You were, you are not anymore. -Is the Room 275 case settled? -Yes, it is. -Did you enjoy yourself? -I was passionate about it. -Will you tell me more? -Whenever you want. -Right now? -Yes. -Let me buy you a drink. -Good idea. -At the bar. -At the bar? I will leave my luggage and come back. -Do you live here? -I have been on vacation since yesterday. I come here to find peace. And to cultivate my relationships. Well, see you soon. All right. -Good afternoon, sir. -Sir. -Do you have a room available? -Certainly. Is… Room 277 free? 277, I believe it is. -Yes, it is. -Then I will take it. Take the gentleman to his room. Thank you, sir. TWENTY STACKS OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS -Hello? -So, you are not thirsty anymore? -More and more. -Hurry up. I will get dressed and go downstairs. THIS ROOM COST 150 PESOS PER DAY When one is so thirsty… Here. Be nice. And there you have it. Aren't you ashamed to have such good luck? Officer candidates are very skilled. A promoted major has to be even more skillful. -Clarence, what are you doing here? -For the same reason you are. Vacationing. Curious resort. Isn't it? And… quite unexpected. -It is a very good place. -Not bad, but crowded. -Too many police candidates. -No quarreling in front of the lady. I will leave you for two minutes. I need to talk to the doorman. All right. Do you live here? What a funny idea. Do you think so? What do you want to have? The real culprit. -A whiskey. -I will have one, too. Two whiskeys. So, your first victim is not enough for you anymore? The Amanyto widow? Poor game. It was put by force in my bag. With a nice little major certificate. -Hey, how do you know? -I called the club. You came back here, just like that, by chance? Not exactly. This case is not over. Pearls' confession is hiding something. You have not learned anything new since our leave. You don't have any new clues? You know something, right? Tell me. -You know something? -Me? Nothing. Thank you. Clarence? Gonzales wanted us. What a triumph, if we roasted it. What do you think? All right. Well done. He has the whole police force behind him. There won't be too many of us. Deal. You do not have cigarettes without a gold tip? That is all we have. Hey. By the way. The longest one loses. There you go. -Mr. Montes, you lost. -He always wins. -Bartender! -That one is on me. I owe you one. It's not expensive. -What are you having? -Have a seat. -One martini. -Two martinis. -Two martinis. -Madam. -See you tomorrow? -Why not. After lunch. All right. It is curious that you met here. You should not be surprised. I do not dislike him either. Is he your best friend? Yes, my partner. Why did you cheat? Well done! You would make a great detective. The stakes were high? High? No, they… They were not high. But tell me, why did you cheat? To save time. -But still… To your best friend. -Partner. Subtle difference. Let’s move on. What are we doing tonight? Let’s drink first, then we will see. Let me see. A familiar friend.. -They are prettier than yours. -Do you think so? You must not often see money as big as this? We cannot say that they are generous with the defenders of the order. I often ask myself if I should not give up this dead-end job. Yeah… Bartender, can you exchange a thousand dollars for me? Cheers. It is a good one. Quickly! Well. You do not look good when you're drunk. Get some sleep. -You are the one who made me drink. -Liar. -Are you going out? -Yes, I am going down and back up again. Are you coming back? Of course, I will be back. Goodbye. Farewell. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. You have what you want, are you happy? Do I look like I am? Let’s get this over with. I have had enough. What is wrong with you today? On the phone, you seemed to like it. At least you seemed to like him. Give me my share, will you? All right. -Fifteen percent, if I recall correctly. -You do. And another one as a bonus. CRIMINAL JUSTICE CODE What is this? That is what you brought me. When Mr. Clarence cashed in my dollars. For a policeman, he does not look stupid or full of prejudice. Well done. You think so? You said it yourself, he is not stupid. -The only choice we have is to leave. -Leave? You do not know me. Impossible, I am expecting a visitor. Aren't you going to ask who it is? -No. -Mr. Clarence. -I am leaving. -No, that would be too easy. -No. Now it is just the two of us. -What do you mean? Just the two of us. It is less windy in the car. It is more comfortable there. You are very kind. Watch out for the steps. Here, sit down. -Don't move. Wait for me here. -I understand. -What's going on? -He's here. -What did he say? -Nothing? I tried to get him to talk, but he held his ground. Send him to me, I will play with him. -All right. -Close the blinds. Turn off the radio. Take off the blindfold. -Sit down. -Sit down. Officer candidate Clarence? Yes. May I ask… Rudy Score. Nice to meet you. Rudy Score? Amanyto's partner? Oh, well… The honor is all mine, sir. Exactly. I have met more police officers than you met Rudy Scores. Yes. Leave us alone. Michael, you will come in when I ring the bell. Just like we agreed. Yes, sir. Are you coming? Where are the dollars? What dollars? Where is the money? How would I know? I tried to make this clear to your special envoys. They are hardheaded. Their fists too, for that matter. Mister Clarence. Yesterday at the Babylon Hotel, a certain Mr. Collins was killed. His real name was Tony Amanyto. I have worked for a long time with Mr. Amanyto. One day, Mr. Amanyto was not fair to me. To be precise, he had me arrested. When I left the prison, I looked for my friend, Amanyto. Naturally, Amanyto was gone. Gone with the cash. Our cash. I went after Mr. Amanyto and after my money. You found Mr. Amanyto. I found him. I did not want to kill him right away. I wanted to say hello and get my money back. Afterwards, Mr. Amanyto died. A bit suddenly. Wallace acted like a fool. His name is Wallace. His name was Wallace. He is very talkative. Before eliminating people, he has to explain. Yes, like he did with Wallace yesterday. You are a brilliant speaker, Mr. Score, but why are you telling me this? It distracts me and at your current stage… It is… right? Yeah, I understand. You are not a fool. No, I am not. -There is not much of a view here. -I do not think of the scenery for others. -Can I ask you for something? -Please do. A cigarette. -I would not have dared. -It's fine. Thank you. So, you have nothing to tell me? I will not insist, but you will regret it. Not for long. You will have company. I have another account to settle. We will do everything at once. That is for me. Bring the other one. Clarence! You have one minute each. Two minutes for both of you. The woman first. What if I talk? Lives will be saved. For both of us? For both of you. -How will you prove it? -I have nothing. It is a matter of trust. The money is at the Hotel Babylon, Room 277, behind the plywood of the fireplace. Thank you. -Do you understand? -Yes, I do. Then go with Murphy to Babylon. If it does not work out, call me. In case you have a memory failure. What about trust, then? -I would like to ask you a question. -So would I. Please go on. -Why did you replace bills with… -Books? Yeah. It was for my superiors at the station. They could have seen me taking the suitcase at customs. I was prepared. I found this book in Amanyto's suitcase. Criminal codes from all the states. Good old Amanyto, it is a thief's idea. Now your question. There is one thing I do not get. Ms. Morgan did what she could. She did not know that I had emptied the wallet. -So… -You are right. I had forgotten. My sister. -Your sister? -Yeah. Oh, nice one! Very well done. He is right, you did great. Thank you. He is right. You know, the "Clarence" earlier, was just… No, I will explain it to you. I assure you, it is very clear. I must thank you for earlier. You were very generous. It is only natural. -If I did that… -Everything is fine, I assure you. That is right, do not mind me. You had better get back to work. Bella. Take care of our guest. I'm sorry. Follow me, please. See you later, sir. What must you think of me? -I lost my handkerchief. -No, it is here. As a femme fatale, I find you under everything. You look like a strange girl who would like to play by candlelight. How did you know? You knew yet you did not say anything? God, the bullies. What did they do to me? -Are you furious with me? -No, why would I be? It is always flattering when a woman takes care of you. Even a little too much. Give this to me. Thank you, my lovely. So what? Jack of Clubs over the Queen of Hearts. The police know a lot. -There you go. -No incident? None. Little bastard. You did not think it would work, did you? Where are the missing 200,000 dollars? -Is that a tic, then? -Michael! -Rudy, please. -There was 400,000 dollars. -Where are the missing 200,000? -I do not know. -You can see that this is true. -Of course it is, I have had enough. I found a suitcase with 200,000 dollars. Here is proof. Do you mind? There. Twenty stacks of ten thousand dollar bills. This is Amanyto's handwriting. But then… Well, then… -Amanyto… -I am not asking you for anything. Well, excuse me then. What were you saying? Nothing fancy. Your friend Amanyto was not stupid. He did not want to put everything in the same suitcase. Someone must know where the money is. Pearls. This woman must be released. The investigation proves that she is not guilty. Now that is original. Two possibilities. She is an accomplice, and by tracking her, we go find the killer, or she will seek revenge and will lead us to the killer. Is that all? This woman is our best hunting dog. -Release her, and I will find him. -You will find him? I do not think so. If you do not mind, let the grown-ups work. I want to talk to the boss. You have the right to the boss's report. I will submit your case to him. Enjoy your vacation. Not stupid… this Montes. Hello. Roberto? Yes, Chief. What? Are you serious about this? Well, as you wish. Hello, Central Jail? This is Roberto. Give me the head guard. Yeah. My goodness… A policeman can go to prison. -What do you mean? -You know what I mean. I need Pearls and you… You may need me. You need me. Maybe. Do you agree? Be specific. You are going to see Pearls in prison. For me, if you want. Make her speak up. When I get my 200,000 dollars back, I will arrange to have her proven innocent. When she gets out, she will have a return ticket, money, and my word that I will forget everything and leave her alone. But I need my money. Is that good enough for you? -No. -What is that? What is in it for me? Your life. You did not understand me. I do not want to live without money. How much? Well… Ten percent, 19,000 dollars. There is some money missing. What about the one thousand you took in the satchel? -You are right. -Deal? -Deal. -Final detail. The people that were with you this morning will not leave you. When you get out of prison, these gentlemen will bring you back here so that you can report to me. -As a bodyguard, I would have rather... -One does not prevent the other. We must hurry. What time is it? It is 2:00 p.m. Your friend Montes is waiting for you at the bar in Babylon. A young man who can be useful to us. Very kind. -You have already said that. -Do what you want but, do it fast. Last clarification, here, we shoot. -So, shall we play blind man's bluff? -I am sorry. Is it necessary? A matter of principle. I do not easily give my address. -I suppose so, if I have an emergency. -There will be no shortage of messengers. It is a matter of minutes. It can be dangerous. Not for me. For you. Well then, let's go. We will release the widow on bail. She has nothing left to wear, I will go with her to her room to pick up some dresses. She will pick up the rest later. She prefers to live elsewhere. What? That must be your job. Believe me, madam… -There you have it. We are going to go. -Yes, I… No, please do not bother. Give me the key. Thank you. Take what you need and let's go. It smells musty in here. Well? You have been very generous. No. I instantly thought you had nothing to do with it. It is simply a question of intuition. You are very nice, you know? It is nice of you to say that. I am saying what I think. You were there? We have been looking for you everywhere. I told you to wait for me in the car. It will never fit, this suitcase is too small. Inspector, in the bathroom, there is a bigger one. Be a sweetheart and go get it for me. On my way. Which one do you want? The small one below or the big one above? Well, more like the big one on top. Open up! But open up, dammit! Open the door! You will see what it will cost you. You are not going to open up? It is not going to happen like that. Open the door! Do you hear? Open up! Please open up! Open up! Mr. Clarence is not here? No, he went out around noon. He did not come back. All right. Tell him to wait for me at the bar. -It will be done. -Thanks. -Would you like to call me a cab? -Certainly, madam. Quickly, get a cab. What is going on? Is anyone there? -Yeah. -Who is there? Montes. What are you doing here? I am freeing you. -Pearls? Where is Pearls? -Pearls? Yes, Pearls. This is your ridiculous proposition again. She is on probation. She took advantage of my investigation and tried to escape. What are you doing here? The case was taken away from you. I asked you for the boss' report. The boss? Damn it, the boss! Hello? Hello? The goody two-shoes. What a whore! The whore. What? No, not you, Rosita. Let me speak to Roberto. Hello, Mr. Roberto? I will put you through to Detective Gonzales. I have a feeling something is going on with Gonzales. Hello? Hello, Roberto? Hey, Pearls got me. Yes, she is gone. Send her description everywhere. What? Are you deaf, old friend! She tricked me. She is gone. Send her description everywhere. Search the hotel and catering facilities. Take some of my men. Yes. And suggest discretion. Especially with the boss. The name of Christopher Columbus' first wife, three letters. I do not care about your three letters. I find you a bit weird with your crossword. -Really? -Absolutely. Well. Mr. Clarence has arrived. He is waiting for you at the bar with Mrs. Morgan. Thank you. Well, here is Montes. -Good afternoon, police. -Good afternoon, madam. Good afternoon, man. Won't you sit down? May I speak to him briefly? No, speak here. Bella and I are the same. Well, here it is. Pearls is gone. That fool Gonzales managed to get himself locked up in the bathroom. It looks like something is wrong. Score is wrong to get into this. Gonzales tore it all down, you see. -But then… -All that has left is to find Pearls. -Good one. -The honor of the class is at stake. -You are the major in charge. -You see? Of course. -Unless… -Any idea? Maybe. Since you are so busy, I am taking the case, right? I will keep you updated. See you tomorrow after lunch. -All right. -Is that okay? -And good luck. -Goodbye. Madam. -What do you think? -About what? You irritate me with your calmness. You do not know my brother. He will be pleased. Montes is going to take care of finding Pearls. There is nothing else I can do. Especially not with them after me. What should we do now? I do not know, we will wait. But not here, it is grim. Where? -Where? -Yes. In the sky. Clarence, listen to me. What is going on? Where is your cop? -In his room. -What do I do? Leave him alone. There are some changes, Pearls is gone. That is bad. I am telling the boss. As you wish. I will keep an eye on Clarence. Keep an eye on everyone. -Bartender. -Here you go. A whiskey. Excuse me. -I had thought… -What? -I was afraid that- -That I would run away? Then close the door. Close the door. Pick up the phone. Repeat. I do not want to be disturbed. Hello? I do not want to be disturbed. I have nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with it. Yes, Ms. Morgan. How long? He asks how long. All my life, of course. All my life. If I don't have my money tomorrow, I am leaving. Call the Babylon. I have taken enough risks already. Pearls in the city is too dangerous. Hello, Babylon Hotel? Please hold. Ms. Bella Morgan. What? Do not disturb Ms. Morgan under any circumstances. What do you mean, under any circumstances? Listen, Miss… Hung up. Hung up. Under no circumstances, she is going all out. Getting better and better. Telegraph in code to Martinez on his yacht to be ready to come and take us to… -Where we came in. -Yes. -At the Black Rocks. -To the Black Rocks. The bags are all packed for tonight. As for Bella… Go to the Babylon Hotel and tell her. I will give myself 24 hours. And Clarence? He has 24 hours as well. If nothing is found, I will kill him. If he finds something… We are killing him as well. I do not like traitors. They are not reliable. So, I decided to strike a blow and set Pearls free. Excuse me, I mean, to free her to better monitor her. Release her without releasing her, that is it. So, I release her, I follow her, everything goes well. She takes me to the Babylon. She goes up to her room. And I, to keep an eye on her but without losing her trust, I go to the bathroom. I mean… I go to the bathroom. There is no way. It will never work. But I have to talk to him. I am going to the ministry, they are waiting for me. -Is the boss here? -He is leaving. Do you have something new and important to tell me? -You mean… -What? No. If you are really in a hurry… No, there is nothing special. -Then, goodbye, Gonzales. -Goodbye, boss. -You again? -Have you told the boss? The boss agrees with me. You are on leave. He'll see you when the academy starts. -No, right now. -He just came out. Mr. Montes, it will cost you. What will you wear? Well, you see. With a white shirt, striped tie. Light gray suit. I was talking about the character. Policeman or thief? And you, what will you wear? Your heart or as a robber? As a robber in love. You see that I can be sincere. Yeah, sure. Do you want me to tell you something? The sentimental kind does not suit you. Confidence for confidence, the careless kind does not suit you either. -What does that mean? -Nothing, I meant about your questions. The answer is… Do not think about it anymore. Or give me an answer. Do you want to know my brother's address? I want to be treated like a partner. It is an opinion, but you should say that to me. Tell me. Don't you want to go dancing? -The question I asked you? -What question? You are right, I certainly want to go dancing. With you. Nobody is missing? -Okay, I will start. -Clarence is missing. -Yes… -This one, when it comes to helping… No, silence. -I will start. -Mickey is missing. What is going on? -A moment of silence. -Yeah, be quiet. This is why I brought you back. It is about the Amanyto case. -Again? -Yes. -As you wish, but… -I am not asking your opinion. One more thing. Tell the operator that anything concerning this woman should be sent to me directly here. I will not leave my office until we find her. -I understand. -Good evening. What is this? Put it there. What a story. Boy, what a story. I got Roberto to talk. The investigations Gonzales had him do have been unsuccessful. So, my idea is this. Pearls left the prison without a penny. She will therefore be looking to sell something. Her pearls are fake, but she has a beautiful ring. There are 200 jewelers in the city. Each of us will visit a district according to these lists. It is a miserable job, I apologize, but the stakes are high. The honor of the promotion requires it. We must succeed. How much do you want, madam? Five hundred dollars. Dollars, why? -Pay me in pesos then, it does not matter. -I do not mind the dollar. Five hundred is too much. 200. It was bought for a thousand. Not by me. Believe me, we are far from the amount. I have some necklaces here, but the beads are fake. The clasps are very nice, platinum with diamonds. Perhaps you could buy them from me to reach the amount? I am afraid that even with the clasps… This one is amazing. My word… it seems… It seemed that to me as well, when I drank too much champagne. Yes, very good imitation. I have never seen anything like it. Beautiful work. I do not have time to waste, I need 500 dollars. Yes, well… Would you show me that ring again? Excuse me. I want to conduct a serious evaluation. Could you come back around 5:00 p.m.? Five hundred dollars? Bring your beads. If there's a gap, I hope we can work something out. I have clients who might be interested. -Pardon me, I am keeping the ring. -Excuse me. See you later. Hello, police? Yes, that is right. She is the one. With a pearl necklace? What is odd is that she does not know its value. It is a museum piece worth at least 200,000 dollars. Two hundred thousand dollars? Will she come back? When? Tonight, at 5:00 p.m. Your address? Wait, I am writing this down. Twelve Park Avenue. I will be there an hour earlier. Until then, hold your tongue. That whore. -Hello, sir. Police. -Sir. Do you know this person? No. -Are you sure? -Absolutely. Good, thank you. -Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon, sir. Do you know this woman? No, why? -Police. -Police? -Your card is fake. -My card is fake? -Hands up! -What is wrong with you? Pedro! Hold this guy for me. Hello? Good afternoon, sir. -Police. -Please, sir, follow me. -Already? -I am sorry, what? Nothing, excuse me. -Do you know this woman? -Yes, that is her. -What do you mean it is her? -The woman who was here earlier. A whole assortment of fake pearls and in it, a real necklace. A hundred pearls of great brightness and extraordinary brilliance. 200,000 dollars. -Are you sure it is her? -Of course, she has just left this place. You let her go? She will be back at 5:00 p.m. with the necklace. -At five. Here? -Yes, here. Please, Mr. Inspector, to be discreet, I have always given… Okay, fine. All right, my friend. At 5:00 p.m. -What is it? -Montes found Pearls. -Really? -Yeah. Amanyto hid a necklace worth 200,000 dollars among the others. -No way. -The girl does not suspect it. We will get her quickly. Go tell Setton, we are going to your brother's place. -Montes must have been mistaken. -No, he was not. It is incredible that we all came empty-handed. I alone have been in 27 jewelry stores. I investigated five jewelers in addition to my list. -Death! -The what? -I escaped death. -What it is all about? Are you crazy? Explain yourself. I go to this guy’s jewelry, I show him my card. Montes! -What is up? -Well, nothing. Nothing at all. -What about you? -Yes. -Then tell us. -I found Pearls. -No way! -We will be able to catch her. -How many are we? -You need a regiment for a chick? Well, I will use this chick to get the fox. Listen, here is my plan. Is it ready? -Why two cars? -A little idea of mine. Get in this one with Setton. Murphy will drive. -You got that, Murphy? -Yes, boss. A word of advice, if you do not mind? If you come across a police patrol, do not open fire. Here, we shoot. Look at him giving us advice. One more thing. Has Pearls seen you before? -Of course she did. -Then she will recognize you. So what? -Well, are you coming? -I do not understand. It is all very simple. Michael and the boss will stop 20 meters away from the store. And we will do the same. Pearls will come from one side or the other. That way, we will not stop in front of the store. Do you understand? Well. It is fine, they are following. I would be curious to see the necklace that almost cost me my capital. -What if it fails? -It cannot. If it fails, there is our boat. Martinez is warned. -Do you think she will come back? -I mean… It is five o’clock. She told me she would come back. As I told your subordinate. Which subordinate? The one who came after my phone call. What do you mean? What subordinate? -How long have you been here? -Ten minutes. -Nothing to report? -Nothing. It is fine then. I told you to hold your tongue. You are an idiot! It will cost you dearly. He is going a bit hard, this guy. You, take… What are you doing here? Don't you see? Some repairs. BLIND Is something wrong, sir? What is this sham? Organized rebellion? I will do organized sanctioning. I will have you all slashed. Did you see the guys talking in front of the jewelery store? It is suspicious. Clarence… We are far enough. Pearls will be here soon. If it comes this way, she is ours. Do not turn off the engine! What is going on? Workers are talking. Good God, this guy looks like Montes. Yes, indeed. That is Montes. It is odd. We will figure it out later. Until then, try to be nice. Pearls does not seem to be coming. Maybe she is already here. Unless you screwed us up. There she is! Just shoot! Take cover! Come here! Fire! -They are going to kill Clarence. -I don't care. -Just shoot! -Don't shoot! -Why did you shoot? -I had orders. -Your friends aim really badly. -They are not that bad actually. Oh, did they hit you? That is funny, then. -Shit. -What? -What is it? -A flat tire. Shit, it looks like… Slow down. They have a flat tire. Yes. This is Gonzales. Tell the boss I am coming. A terrible story. Go get an ambulance. Change the numbers quickly. Meet me upstairs. So, what do you think? It is nothing. Bella will take care of you. Here it is. He almost tricked me, this smart guy. Fortunately, we shot him on time. Did you do this? Did you kill him? I am talking about Amanyto. Amanyto, not Clarence. Without Clarence, I was taken over by a dead man. He was very nice, your sweet Clarence. He went to fetch this up in front of the police force. Excuse me. You gave me such a scare. For real? Are you hooked this time? -What do you care? -I would like to know for sure. Me too. You will have to do the same and wait. I like you. I am interested in what affects you. A bit too much, sometimes. Look, I never asked you for anything. Yes, money, of course. Bring Clarence with us. For someone you are not sure you love. He disgusts me, I don't like this prick. -You are good at being disgusted. -I am not saying I will not take him. -Clarence! -Be careful, I am fragile. -Are you injured? -Let me see. It's okay, the bullet is out. Clean it up and put a bandage on it. It will heal in two days. Shit, we won a good one! Setton, the tank is leaking. Go tell Score. He will be pleased. -Is it less painful? -Yes, a little less. That's enough, we will not rot here. What's the matter? The gas tank is leaking. Not a drop left. Michael and Murphy are repairing it. Go get 20 liters of gas. -It's a long way. -Figure it out. -The employees will bring you back. -It's not safe. We have no choice! Run and hurry up. What are you thinking about? Nothing, I am thinking of the wasted time. The police will drive around in every car they have. This is bad. Do not copy my moves. Lovely girl, turn on the radio. -Do you want some music? -I need information. It feels a bit like it. It does not work. Was he your best friend? -He still is. -No comments. Please continue. Listen, sir. From the beginning, Clarence and I suspected something. We drew straws to know who would take the risk and jump into the lion's den. Clarence had found a suitcase full of money. There was also a beautiful woman who seemed to know a lot, and that could lead us to the goal. We also drew her at random. -Strange technique. -Absolutely. That is how Clarence gained Rudy Score's trust. -A little too much, perhaps. -Shut up! Please, Mr. Montes. I am telling you that Clarence has Score in his pocket. Clarence used to tell me everything through crossword. Crosswords, now? You do not believe me? It is true, it is difficult. -Very nice to defend your friends… -I am telling the truth! It was not Score that Clarence tricked, it is you. Look, Clarence is not a traitor. Later on, he will give me Rudy Score’s address. What do you mean? -By our speaker system. -Very funny. All-knowing Mr. Clarence has not yet been able to give you the address. No, they drove him to Score blindfolded. Well done, everything is there. The blindfold, the underground, the rope ladder. Listen, boss. Why don't we get back to work? I swear to you, Clarence is not a traitor. He risks his life for all of us. You are right, Gonzales. We should better get to work. What a story! It is never going to work. Boss, would you come here for a second? Cheer up. You may leave. Everyone is dismissed. He is always grumbling, I will send him on his way. Rosita, are you still keeping line 324 to the club for me? -Until death. -Thank you. Holding the line for so long is a problem. The other five are not enough? -Still nothing? -Still nothing. Hello? The press office? Do you want to write down? During the attack on Park Avenue, we recognized in Rudy Score's gang a police candidate, Mr. Clarence. Yes. Mr. Clarence. You can publish and comment. Thank you. Do not panic. You will understand. We cannot see anymore, it's dark. What is Setton doing? We are not going to get caught for a missing can. You will leave by your own means. You take the liner. See you in Caracas. Yes! Police headquarters are communicating. This afternoon at five o’clock an armed robbery was committed in front of a jewelry store, Park Avenue. The perpetrator of the attack has been identified. It is none other than Rudy Score, the famous American bandit. The party begins. He managed to escape, his capture is just a matter of hours. The car in which the bandits fled is identified. This is a black Chrysler, four-door interior drive, a model from 1938. At the time of the attack, it had the license plate number 2074. It is likely that this number is fake. Another car was used and was abandoned shortly after. It's a green Cadillac, interior drive, four doors, with the license plate number 4403. Here is the description of Rudy Score. Apparent age 40 to 45 years, height five foot eight. -Quite a strong build. Black eyes… -The sounds clearer. During the attack, the bandit was wearing a gray herringbone overcoat and a gray soft hat. Special measures have been put in place to carry out his arrest. We ask the people to assist the civil force. Each citizen must bring their IDs… It seems to be working. Interesting. New information is coming in. We suspend our broadcast and ask you to stay tuned. The big game, you know. It feels good. They are not talking about you. There is only one star. What are you going to do now? Now, Mr. Clarence, we are moving. we are moving? But we still have to get through it. Here it is! I only know the hard way. A pencil, write that down. I do not want to get arrested. Go get the boss, he needs to hear this. Crap! Still not free. Here is the rest of the press release. Unfortunately, it is certain that a member of the police candidates, a man named Clarence actively participated in the Park Avenue case. All departments have been alerted. Well, Mr. Clarence. Are we changing our business card? Do you know the land? -All the way. -You will lead us. Rudy, let me go with you. -That is not what I said. -I want to go with you! Shut up! For aficionados, we would like to inform you that next Sunday at the town square a bullfight including the killing of eight bulls coming from the ranch… will take place. I have the gas, but it doesn't look good. The police are on the move. Do not worry, we will get through. I tried to call you. Never free, how come? I have not phoned since you left. -Is the tank fixed? -Not yet. Go help them. …by Ortega who, in a dazzling form and in possession of his means… We are no longer cared for. -Look for another station. -We can try. They are silent for now. It is so beautiful. -This is Chopin's first prelude. -Is it? What itinerary do you suggest? It depends on where we have to board. Turn off the radio, we cannot hear each other. -I say where do we board? -That is easy. The boat comes to take us… Clarence? Speak up, for God's sake! We embark at Black Rocks. Black Rocks, that is all I know. From here, we take the road to Paloma. Straight ahead. We go around a fishing village, we are at Black Rocks. -It is fixed, we can leave. -We will follow you. -Well? -What happened? Clarence has spoken, boss. It is true. The moment we were going to find everything out, cut. Gone. What is the number that just called 324, police? Yes. That is right. Very well, thank you. And the address? All right, thank you. This is it, boss. We have him. Now let's go. -I will go with you. -You would slow us. Go back to Babylonia and wait quietly for your liner. Quietly? Clarence, say something. Don't you have something to say? Well, Clarence? Are you coming? See you soon. -Rudy… -I said no. Come on, downstairs. Where are they? Well, let's waste our time. Yeah, that is it. My lovely. One of them will get away with it. Not both, that is impossible now. You must choose. Rudy Score or Clarence? Where are they? Answer the question! They went to Black Rocks. Come on, downstairs. Thank you very much, Bella. If you need to get some fresh air, the door of the house is open. -What happened? -They ran away. They embark on Black Rocks. Clarence must believe that we are already there. Are you coming with us? Well, at this point, let's hurry. I will come up with you. -Take the car and follow us. -Okay, boss. How far away is this? -Not that far. -That is good. In one kilometer, there will be a crossroads and two roads to choose from. On the left, we go around the mountain. To the right, we cross it. -Through a tunnel. -Is it shorter? Of course, but it is more supervised. We can take the one on the left. -Did you hear that? Turn left. -No, turn right. The tunnel. Understood. -Why ask for my opinion? -To do the opposite. -What is wrong with you? -It is not funny anymore. Get it? Let me explain, Setton. Here is what happened. What a great fairy tale. One should not play with fire. You will get off at the next one. No, we will keep him until the end of the line. Michael, you will switch places with him. Should we have caught up with them? They had to take the tunnel route. If we took the shortcut, we could catch them. Yes, let's take the shortcut. Wait for me here. Put the car across in the tunnel. You will come back. I will guide you. Score will come in from the other end. With three friends, go through the tunnel and hide at the entrance. As soon as Score is through, prevent him from going out. -Come on, quickly! -All right. Try not to harm Clarence, if he is still alive. Move forward a little more. Stop, it is okay. When they see the car, it will be too late. Turn off the headlights. -We hear a car. -Yes, indeed. Montes! Hurry up, damn it! Here is the tunnel. Open the door, quickly! I think Clarence and Murphy have had their share. Take a look. Turn it off, you idiot! We must get out of here at all costs. Let's try to force the passage in the direction of Black Rocks. Maybe they will back off. Go ahead. Do not shoot until you are on top of them. Surrender, Score! You will not escape. We do not need the headlights, it will be bright in an hour. You will not escape! Surrender now! I wonder if Clarence is with them. Clarence? Clarence? Clarence! Is that Clarence? Wait a minute, he will pay for it. Well done, Mr. Clarence. Thirty-seven point two. In a month, he will be working out. -What a strong man. It is unheard of. -It is normal. Why do you want, honest people to be more fragile than criminals? Obviously. Conclusion, this promotion will not have a major. That is a shame. Why? There will be two, simple as that. Yeah. Yeah, but that is how traditions are lost. That is how they are created. From now on, there will be two majors per promotion. By the way, Gonzales… Come with me. We have a little business to settle. -A little business? -Yes. See you later, kids. A little business? A police officer should expect anything. Well, Gonzales… As you wish, boss. As you wish. -For Clarence, hip hip hip… -Hooray! They took their time. I am the only one left to know that you are the king of bastards. You do not remember? Amnesia? Poor friend. Remember the bar at Babylon? You think I did not see you? I did not say anything. I knew the role would suit you, very well, indeed. THE END Subtitle translation by: Dragana Vasic
