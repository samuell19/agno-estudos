(pounding on door) (glass shatters) (Chloe screams) Stay away. I mean it. Stay away from me! I'll call the police! I mean it. You touch me, and you're gone! (blades scraping) Stay away from me! - [Woman] Cut! Cut! Cut, cut it. Cut. (blades swishing) Cut it. You idiot! I told you not to go for the throat straightaway. You've got to rip her blouse off first, like in rehearsals, remember? - I forgot. - Hey, everyone, Robert De Niro here forgot, once again. - [Man] Yeah, nice one, Brad. - Okay, we're going to call it a night. And you can thank our genius thespian here for your three hours' overtime. Fuck in" loser. - [Woman] Okay, we have a wrap. (all chattering) - What's her problem? - You, you dumb dickhead! Touch my tits one more time, I'll kick your balls in, understand? Lossman! Lossman, where's my Coke? I want my Coke in my hand, with ice, the second she calls wrap, okay? (light orchestral music) (wolf howling) (tapping) - Yeah? It's you. What do you want? - You made me look stupid tonight in front of all my friends. - No, I didn't, sweetheart. You did that all by yourself. And I'll let you in on a little secret. You don't have any friends. The fact is you're replaceable in that mask. I could put a monkey in that suit, and he'd do a better job. Anyway, I've had enough. I'm going to speak with Jim, and he can sort it out. - [Brad] What do you mean? - I mean, my producer will speak with your agent about discontinuing your services. Do you understand that? (breathing heavily) Oh. Nice touch. For the first time, you actually frightened me. Look, everyone's got their level, and mine is making intelligent family drama, and yours is doing cheesy clown acts in shopping malls. I'm sorry, but you just can't cut it in features. - [Brad] Hilary, look. (blades scraping) - Get out of here. Take one step closer, and I'll scream. - [Brad] It's hard to scream without a tongue. (ominous orchestral music) (Hilary screaming) - Just put those in the car. I got to go talk to Mein Fuhrer. (eerie ambient music) (high-pitched wailing) (knocking on door) Hilary, it's Vanessa. Oh, my god! (gasping) What do you want? Sex? Do you mean you want to have sex with me? - [Brad] Sex? Yeah, sure. - Well, okay. Let's go. You're going to have to take that silly mask off. (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Vanessa? (electricity crackling) - So, to answer your question, Raffy, that's why I don't include the slasher genre in my course. Fair enough? - So, Mr. Lossman, what happened to the film? - "Hot Blooded"? It was never finished. There's a cut work print in the archive, I believe. - Would it be possible to see it? - For what purpose, Raffy? - Well, we have to do a graduation film, right? What better project than to finish that film? - And it could also make a shitload of money. Are the rights available? - Hester, full marks for your entrepreneurial spirit, but I don't think so. - Why not? - Because that movie was a nightmare, and you don't go playing with nightmares. (suspenseful orchestral music) I'll see you all next week. - Hey, he should have killed Lossman, eh? - [Man] Yeah. (all chattering) - [Raffy] Mr. Lossman, we were serious about the movie. - And so was I, Raffy. Look, you two have more important things to say. Don't waste your time doing trash. - But it's not trash. A horror film can be just as political as "Priscilla" or "The Piano". Look, even if it's not, what's wrong with making a scary film, giving people a bit of a fright? - A few years back, a director, a young kid out of video clips, did just that. The producer hired him to complete "Hot Blooded". It was the first time the print had been screened since the murder of Hilary Jacobs. What happened next is totally bizarre. The kid was butchered, but the police never found the killer. The creepy thing is, the projectionist was the only one with access to the screening room, and he was cleared. - [Raffy] So what you're saying is, there's some sort of a curse on this film. - All I'm saying is that this is something best left alone. Thought is deed. - What do you mean? - If you read eastern philosophy, the ancients say that what you think, you create. "Hot Blooded" was a loathsome piece of shit that never should've been made in the first place. - So what's the story with the producer? - He tried to finish the film so that he could save his investment. One night, while he was in the editing room, he was electrocuted. (electricity crackling) - [Raffy] It was an accident. Accidents happen. - Look, I'm not superstitious, and I don't believe in curses or what have you. - [Kid] Sorry. - Listen, you kids have a gift. Don't waste your combined talents on this ugly piece of shit. - So what do you think? - I think it'd be cool. Let's do it. - Yeah.

And get this, she said she's prepared to put in some money to see it finished. - Good girl! - What's the story with casting? - Well, the girl who played the sister, her name's Vanessa Turn bill, and she lives in LA, and she's done a couple of B-grade movies, and she's doing daytime soap at the Mument, so I think we can get her. - I can market that. -Um, hi. What about all these people who keep sort of dying, trying to make this film? You gonna market that, do you think, miss producer, or-- - Probably. - Yeah? That's promising. - So, who's in? Who wants to make a mainstream slasher movie? Bigger than "Halloween", creepier than "Friday the 13th", more blood and guts than "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"! - More sex than "Deep Throat". - You're so bad. - [Man] Oh you are changing sides, mate. - It's time we graduated into pop culture, boys and girls. So what say you? Who's in? - Yes. - Yep. - Yes.

What kind of merit? - I done some checking. Word around town is they're the next big thing, particularly the director, this kid called Raffy. They say she's the next Jane Campion. Listen to me. This could be the next hit at Sundance, this kind of movie. Look what "Scream" did for Courteney Cox. - Give me a break. She was a millionaire already. I just don't know if I can do it, Jerry. It's going to dredge up all kinds of old shit. Besides, there's a celebrity golf tournament in Las Vegas next week. - Nessie, baby, I'll be able to work the bejesus out of this. Are you kidding me? Slasher movie gone horribly wrong, buried for years. Vanessa Turn bill goes back to face her demons. You can't buy publicity like this. "E!," "Entertainment Tonight,” "Access Hollywood", they'll go crazy. Sweetheart, I don't want to be reading the trades one morning, see this movie grossing 100 mill, and you not a part of it. Do you and me a favour. Fly coach to Australia. Ooh! Hey! - Coach? (man announcing flights over PA) (car horn honking) (heavy metal music) - Hi. Vanessa. I'm Raffy. I'm the director. And this is Hester. She's the producer. Sorry we're late. We ran out of petrol, and... I'll help you with these. - Okay, we got a press conference in an hour. Would you like to freshen up? - So am I booked in a hotel, or am I sleeping at your house? (bag thudding) - Miss Turn bill, why have you come back to finish the movie? - Well, it's extremely rare that you find really good parts for women, so when I find one, I just jump at the chance. - Miss Turn bill, Holly Jones reporting live, Channel 5. Are you worried about the curse, Miss Turn bill? - What curse? - Every time there's an attempt to finish this film, someone dies. - There's a special clause in my contract. If I die, I get paid extra. - Aren't you concerned at all that it will bring back bad memories, Miss Turn bill, doing this film? - All of that happened a long time ago, and I've put all that behind me. So it's wonderful to be back in Australia. Anyway, I would have killed these two if they left me out. I only just arrived, so if you'll excuse me-- (all chattering) - Thank you very much. That will be all. - I got to get some sleep. Can you take me back to the hotel? - Your room won't be ready till two. They're still cleaning. You want a coffee? (heavy metal music) Her husband must have done well out of slasher films. - I'll be frank with you. The only reason I am doing this, because I need the money. My late husband and I have a first dollar gross position, which means nothing unless the film is finished and on-sold. Hopefully, this will be my little nest egg. (suspenseful orchestral music) Sign that. - What is it? - It's an indemnity. From now on, I'm not responsible for anything that happens. It's on your heads. It's called blood money, girls. Blood money. - Hi, Bobby. - Hi. - Are you doing this movie? - Uh, yeah. Well, production on "Mad Max 4" got pushed back a few weeks, so I got a window. - Cool. - Hey, look, let's meet up later and go over the makeup, yeah? - Yeah, sure. - Isn't this where that guy got murdered? You know, watching this same print? - What guy? - Well-- - You guys got a second? You know a couple days ago, we were talking about the possibility of-- - Jesus Christ. Has somebody been smoking in here? - I heard she always gets off with her costar. - What about when she did that TV remake of Lassie? (laughing) - Haven't you ever heard of secondhand smoke? - Hi. I'm Bobby Duke. I'm your costar. I'm playing Scarman, psycho killer guy. - Good casting. (all laughing) - Hello? Hi. - "Hot Blooded". Ooh, daddy, not these cans again. I thought they'd been destroyed. You Raffy Carruthers? - Yeah. - Loved your short. Bloody brilliant. Except that last shot was straight out of "Shock Corridor", you derivative little thing, you. Listen, I've written a screenplay. You want to read it? - You seen this? - Yeah, I screened it once. Best thing the director ever did. Yeah. Bit of a hack she was, though, you know? Or should I say she was a bit hacked, you know? Last time I screened this, a kid sat at the front. Got his throat slit by some psycho cleaner. It's a funny thing, you know? You've seen so many murders on the screen. You see the real thing, hey, it's no big deal. Then you get these gender-specific assholes that think that screen violence is going to turn us all into mass murderers. Well, that's crap. I've seen hundreds of murders. I've seen thousands of murders. Next time somebody goes into McDonald's, shoots up 20 people with an Uzi, and they find a Steven Seagal video in his back pocket, you know what they ought to do? They ought to ring "60 Minutes”, get them to do one of their chequebook bullshit journalism stories on me, because I'm a walking advertisement for liberalising X-rated everything, eh? You know what I mean? Art is art, eh? - Okay, everyone, let the horror begin. (Rick laughing evilly) Shut up, Rick. - What? (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Mum] Kids, I've put your dinner on the stove. - [Boy] Okay, Mum. - [Mum] Don't forget to lock up, Chloe. (ominous orchestral music) - Freddie. (cat meows) You getting tired? (ominous orchestral music) - What's wrong? - I thought I heard something. (liquid hissing) (wind blowing) - [Chloe] Tell me, Freddie, why do little brothers like to freak out their sisters? You asleep already? Well, you're just going to have to move. (Chloe screaming) (telephone ringing) Hello? - [Man] Now you die. (gasping) (blades scraping) Stay away from me! - [Hilary] Cut! Cut! Cut. Cut it. Cut! - That was her voice. Did you hear her voice? He's. He's, wake up. He's. (screaming) (man growling) (crying) - Bobby, that's enough. It's cruel. (all laughing) - [Rick] Sucked in! - [Bobby] Did I pass the audition? - With flying colours, sir. - I did the makeup. Not bad for a quickie in the dark, eh, Raff? - That's your specialty, isn't it, Jules, quickies in the dark? - You're a retard, Paulie. - I didn't buy into it, Raff. - You're all a bunch of fuckwits! - Come on. Bus leaves at seven a.m. sharp. Check your gear, please. - [Paulie] I didn't mean-- - [Damien] Fuck off, Paulie. Grow up. - It's funny. - [Bobby] Don't think I went too far, do you? (ominous orchestral music) - Hello? Hello? (ominous orchestral music) 4 One, two J 4 One, two, three, four J (upbeat rock music) - So our star isn't travelling with us, then? - Vanessa? - Yeah. - No. We sprung for a driver. - Of course. - Has anyone seen Raff? - Everyone off the bus! How are we supposed to make this film without our famous director? Maybe Damien could take over, like he did in the short. - Shut up, Paulie. That's bullshit, and you know it. - Hey, we were all there, mate, and you're not talking to the cinema papers now, lover boy. - Raff, I'm sorry. We're all sorry. It was meant to be a joke. (dramatic orchestral music) - Did you pick up the print? - Yeah. It's in the back. - [Raffy] Guess we broke the curse, huh?

Bobby's got a thing for Jules. - Jules is porking Jim. - Jules and Jim? Are you serious? - Yes. - I thought Jim was porking Hester. - Hester's a dyke, you dork. Plus, she's got the hots for Raffy. - What about Raffy and Bobby? - Raffy and Bobby is unrequited so far, but Raffy has shown an interest in moi. - You? - Yeah. - Was she shitfaced? - One of these days, you are going to implode with envy, you poor, pathetic little creature. - Hey, I can't help it that I'm endowed like that guy out of "Boogie Nights". - What, with a fake dick? - They've got to be kidding. - It's only for a few days. - This bed's got bugs in it. I can tell just by looking at it. If I spend one night in this thing, I'm going to need a masseuse. I swear to god. - I did a course in reiki. - Reiki? No shit? (light orchestral music) - [Rick] So this is the house of horrors? - Watch your feet. I don't want mud everywhere. Are you going to put something down? I don't want a herd of elephants tramping dirt through here, you know. - Yes, Mr. Drivett, we'll be really careful. I'll make sure they treat it like it was my own house. - That's no comfort to me, young lady. You look like you'd live in a dump. Hey, hey! Put that down, son! That's bone China, from China! - Really? I thought it was from bone. (laughing) - Now the rules are these. No drugs, no loud music, no eating or drinking in the house. I've disconnected the phone, so you can't make any personal calls. - Can I ask one, small favour? - Well, you can certainly ask. - We have the original print of the film in the bus outside, and I was wondering if we could put it in a safe place inside the house. - Certainly, young lady, you can, uh, keep it upstairs in my bedroom. It'll be safe there. Now, you, come with me. I want to talk about the location fees. - [Rick] I want to check out the kitchen, too. We've got some shots in there. - Paulie! - [Cassie] Rick! (plate shattering) You idiot! - Cassie, you've deboned the China! - You're a moron, Rick. Oh, I hate you! - Somehow, I doubt that. - Rick, next time you do something like that, you two can go home. - Promise? - Yes. - I didn't do it. (light orchestral music) - Where the hell is our expensive import? (phone beeps) Oh, great! No signal. - Bad luck, huh? (sighing) That must have been where she was murdered. - [Hester] Who? - Hilary Jacobs, the director. They said it was a Swiss chalet. It always sounded so weird. - Who said? - Can't use your phone, huh? How will you cope? (sighing) (all chattering) Okay, everybody, can I just have a few seconds of your time, please? - [Rick] Okay, everyone, come on. Shhh shhh! - Okay, the back story goes something like this. When they were kids, their parents went out and left them on their own in the house and the house caught on fire. Now, Charlie got horribly burned and scarred for life, but his beautiful sister Chloe got out unscathed. Now, he hates her for that and he hates his mum and dad for doing this to him. His dad is the first to go. He went in reel two. Then, an assorted range of victims until we get to reel nine. Which is where the film stopped as he Kills his sister. Now, the scenes we're about to film are where the mother gets killed, who will be played by Vanessa, and this is the climax of the film, so I don't need to tell you how important it is. Now, does anybody have any questions? - Yeah, do they sell any tofu around here? (ominous orchestral music) (sniffing) (ominous orchestral music) - Scare you? (grunting) - Hurt you? (bobby groans) (kids chattering) - Are you ready, Bobby? (sighing) Okay, you've got the front part of that. Yup, just get that on. Great. How's that feel? Can you breathe? Yup. Let's make sure that's fine there in the collar. - [Bobby] Ah, stupid! - You all right, Bobby? - Here, let's get this fixed up. Okay, I'll just pop the collar underneath there. There you go. - [Bobby] Al right! Now you die. (ominous orchestral music) (all chattering) - All right, I'll go set up. Ahhh, that's the ticket. (breathing heavily) (ominous orchestral music) Bobby, you, why don't you practise your method bullshit on, I don't know, someone else, mate. Dickhead! Just go back to your Winnebago and act like a tree! You must be the unscariest villain I've ever seen! Bloody actors with so much spare time on their hands. What are you doing watching me piss, anyway? Prefer a Polaroid? (engine revving) - [Raffy] Vanessa, keep your foot off the brake. Don't accelerate too much. - [Damien] Slower, Jimmy, slower. Take your timing from the car. - Yeah, except it changes every take 'cause the bimbo can't drive. - Nobody told me I had to drive a goddamn car, and the steering wheel's on the wrong side! - It really affected you, didn't it, the killing? - Yes, it did. - You know, horror movies aren't that bad, Mr. Lossman. You think about it. They can be cathartic for young kids. I mean, it's all about letting go of your fear. - How do you mean? - Well, you go to the movies and there's a psycho killer out in the bush wood-chipping people. Suddenly, the things you're scared of don't seem so important anymore. Like the craters on your face, the size of your ass, or will that cute guy ask you out, that sort of stuff. Horror movies put that into perspective. When you think about it like that, they've actually got, kind of, a social value. (ominous orchestral music) - Shit! - I'm in character! - [Hester] Bobby! - Excuse me. - [Vanessa] Cut it! Cut it! I need a stunt driver! (projector running) (ominous orchestral music) - [Man] What have you got? - Time of death, I put about 28 hours ago, plus or minus. Deceased was part-time, single. No one noticed him missing. Weapon appears to be a single blade about 30 Cs, very sharp. He was disembowelled like it was some sort of ritual slaying. - Ta. So who was last in the theatre? - A group of film school students. Made a booking, came in last night. - I need a stunt driver! - [Raffy] Vanessa, you read the script. You knew you had to drive. - Every movie I've ever done, I've always had a stunt driver! - [Raffy] But if you told us-- - [Vanessa] Do you think I'm fucking sly Stallone, fucking Jackie Chan? I don't do my own stunts! Where's Lossman? - [Cassie] Paulie. Paulie, please, wait. - Cass, come on. - Paulie, no, not here. Look, I've got to get back and so do you. - I told Rick I had to go back to town, get some extra batteries. I told He's you were feeling sick and had to go back and have a lie down. - You bastard. - So we've got all night. (breathing heavily) - [Cassie] Bobby! - What, Bobby? Come on! - Get off! Get off! Paulie! - [Paulie] You want it, Cassie? - No! (Cassie screaming) Oh, shit! (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) Why? Bobby? Bobby, is that you? (screaming) (glass shattering) Get away from me! Get away from me! Aaah, get away from me! (grunting) (glass shattering) (breathing heavily) What do you want of me? What do you want? What do you want? - Cut it! - Let's call it a night? Everyone's tired. We could pick up tomorrow. - Yep. - So, are you going to ask me to ride a goddamn horse tomorrow? - No. Tomorrow you die. - Oh, I can hardly wait. - [Julie] Vanessa, can I just grab a couple Polaroids of you? - [Vanessa] Fuck off! - [Julie] Oh. (eerie ambient music) - We're missing three. Cassie went back sick? - So did my asshole of a boomie. - Funny about that. - Yeah. - Where's Bobby? (ominous orchestral music) Where have you been all night? - Just doing the method. - Yeah, meaning scaring the shit out of people. I'm still wet, by the way. - What? - Oh, you fake sincerity so well. - It's the secret of good acting, mate. - Yeah! - [Bobby] Duh! (ominous orchestral music) (sighing) - Happy with what you got? - Yeah, it was all right. Damien's great. - How is our star? - Well, she can play hysterical really well. - Do you want to have a drink tonight, before bed? - Thanks, He's, but I'm pretty tired. - Yeah, I understand.

Hello? Is someone there? (screaming) What are you doing here? - Sorry, I thought you might want some company. (suspenseful orchestral music) - You still get nightmares? - Uh-huh, and you? - Oh, yeah. My therapy bill at the end of each month is huge. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night screaming. I used to take uppers for years to keep from going to sleep. I still can't walk into a building late at night without getting the shakes. How about you? - Same. I remember your face, looking at me. I'll never forget that. - Flying in coach for 14 hours makes you think. Why did I do this? Why did I come back? I don't know. I guess I just needed to face it, once and for all. I'm scared. - [Lossman] Scared of what? - Those scenes tomorrow. - [Lossman] Don't worry. You'll be fine. I'll be there. (suspenseful orchestral music) You know, I don't get it, Raff, this film. You could have done whatever you wanted, Lossman thinks you're god. - Yeah, but I wanted to do this film. - Why? You think it's going to set you up as a commercial director? Is that it? - No, it's not. It's a little more personal than that. - Ha! What's personal about a horror movie? - I've just got to finish this film. (knocking on door) - Hester Ryan? - Yes. Who are you? - I'm senior detective lan Hollander from special crime squad, and this is Detective Carter. Can we have a word, please? - Sure. - So did you notice anything unusual at the theatre? You notice anyone strange hanging around the set at all? - No. - Anything unusual that you can think of? - Nothing. No one. Nothing out of the ordinary. - I suppose you've heard about this curse. - Miss, we know that seven years ago one Angelo-- - [Woman] Zabriki. - Zabriki was killed in that same theatre watching the same film, and we're investigating the possibility that there's a connection between the two. But at the Mument, we're investigating as if they're separate incidents. You see, we don't think the projectionist was killed by a curse, Miss Carruthers. We believe he was killed by one or more very sick individuals who are quite capable of being apprehended by police officers such as ourselves. - Do you have any idea why someone would want to stop this film being made? - Beats me. - Well, if you can think of anything, give us a call. And if you could give us the details of where you're filming, that would be of help. - Sure. (knocking at door) Yeah? - Can I come in? - Sure. - You okay? - [Raffy] I don't know. I don't know what's happening. - Look, someone got murdered, and it's awful and tragic, but it has nothing to do with us or what we're doing here. You believe that? - [Raffy] I don't know what to believe. - What I'm worried about now is the others. I don't think we should tell anyone. I don't want Rick getting spooked, pulling a number, stopping the shoot. What do you think? - I think Paulie and Cassie didn't come home last night, because Rick checked their beds, and they haven't been slept in. - What? You think there's a connection? - I don't know, but it's a little bit creepy. - You know those two. They probably got shit-faced, bonked all night, and fell asleep in one of the old sheds. Raff, this isn't life imitating art. The projectionist got murdered. Fact is, he was a wacko. I don't believe there's some cracked killer out there stalking us like we're in the plot from "Bride of Chucky 7" or whatever. Life doesn't work like that. If Cass and Paulie don't turn up by crew call, I'll call the cops, okay? - Okay. - You are brilliant and you're going to make a brilliant movie. We just got to keep it all on the rails.

Where's Bobby? - I dressed him about an hour ago. - Was he any good? - Cretin. (heavy breathing) - Um, look, what we'll do is we'll dolly into a two-shot, then we just push in to a closeup of Vanessa. - Closeup? - Bobby, got your shears? All right, do you want to move over next to the wall here, and if you can hide behind here and wait for her to come. Okay, we'll do a lineup on that shot if you want to go back to first positions, thanks, Vanessa. Going for a rehearsal. Okay, and action. - Ow! Hey! Get off! - What are you doing? This is a rehearsal, man, not a take! - If we're moving that fast, I'm going to need some lubricant for the track. - You'd have some of that left over from last night, wouldn't you, sweet cheeks? - Hey, come on, guys! Hey, break it up! One more line like that, and you can really go home. - Sounds lovely. - Um, should we just set up for a take? Do you want to do something about the mask? It doesn't look right. - Now, how tight is this closeup? Are we talking crow's feet? (phone beeps) (ominous orchestral music) - Hello, police? Damn it! (screaming) Ew! Aah! (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) (growls) (panting) (gasping) (eerie ambient music) (Hester whimpers) (metal creaking) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful orchestral music) No! (screaming) (grunting) (grunting) Keep away from me! (screaming) (screaming) No. No! (thumping) - Is Jim back yet? I asked him to go get a generator. - Maybe he's found a place that sells tofu. - How the hell am I supposed to make a film when my entire crew go walkabout? You guys keep at it, and I'll go find him. (dramatic orchestral music) Jim? (screaming) - Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. - No, that's all right. I'm just a bit on edge tonight, that's all. - I wanted to ask you something away from everyone else. - [Raffy] Yeah? - Why this movie? - I told you already. - It wouldn't have something to do with your mother, would it? - My mother? - Hilary Jacobs? She was your mother, right? - Yeah, yeah, she was. - So, that's why you want to finish the film. - Everybody thought that she was a hack director, but she wasn't, Mr. Lossman, she was so much more than that. You can tell by looking at this film. - She was not a hack, believe me. She had to be smarter and tougher than all of them. And she was. (ominous orchestral music) My god. They've been slashed. - Who would do something like this? - Kids, maybe. Locals. I don't know. My car, too. - You don't think that, that this could be-- - What? - Nah, don't worry about it. By the way, have you seen He's? (breathing heavily) (exhales loudly) - Jesus Christ! Rick. You had me going there for a sec, man. You're going to put me out of a job, bro. (laughing) I've got one of those, too. "Face-off". Wes craven style. (grunting) (gagging) - I'll show you how to shimmy. - That's great. Okay, let's go for a take. Can I get the cast in? - Yeah, sure. - Ta. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Okay, Bobby, time to do some killing. Come on. - Okay, Bobby, these are the shears you're going to be using. They're a special effect number, so, as you can see. Now, when you kill her, I want you to stab her in the stomach and bring it up into her rib cage. Hey, Vanessa. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Rick] Sorry. My fault. - Okay, like this. In and up. That didn't hurt. So you can do it quite hard, all right? - You grope me, you're history. - [Raffy] Any questions? - [Man] Nope. - Then we'll go for a take. Jules, do you want to do final checks? You right with that, Rick? Yeah? Damien? (car horn honking) Okay, when you're ready, Jules. - Thanks. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. - And, roll sound. (clicking) - Speed. - Mark it. - 11, Take one. (horn honking) - Hold on, hold on. - Who the hell is that? - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. (ominous orchestral music) (car horn honking) - The police have been to see me. You must stop. You must stop at once. - What's wrong? What's happened? - The evil is back. Oh, I knew this would happen. - [Raffy] Okay, stand by to shoot. - Okay. - [Raffy] Roll sound. - Speed. - [Rick] Mark it. - [Julie] 11, take one. - And action. - Ow! Cut! Can we cut? Cut it! - What's the problem? - I have this lash that's come loose. You're going to see it in the close up. And that's too hard, all right. Can you back off? - Julie, would you like to fix Vanessa's false eyelash for her? - Yeah, yeah, sure. - As quick as possible, thanks, and we'll go for another one. - Where is the original print of the film? - I don't know. It's upstairs, I think. Why? - Mr. Lossman, there is a force at work here. It is not human, and it is unspeakably evil. You must destroy that film at once, or you will all die. - Okay, roll sound. - Uh, speed. - Mark it. - [Jules] 11, take two. - And action. Cut it! Cut it! - Run! Get away from him! - Bobby, what the hell are you doing? - [Lossman] That's not Bobby! (screaming) Come on, quick! - [Raffy] Run! - [Lossman] Where's Damien? (breathing heavily) (ominous orchestral music) (screaming) Where's the old lady? - She's there! - [Rick] Just leave her! Come on, let's go! - She's got the keys, you idiot! Wait here. - Vanessa, where are you going? Get in the car! - I've killed him once, I can kill him again! (screaming) - [Raffy] Damien! - You know, Jules, I've never said this before, but I've always found you very attractive. - Oh, fuck off! - Okay. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Did you see where he went? (stair creaking) (woman screams) (animal yelps) We need weapons. - Damn it! I knew I should have brought my handgun. (static hissing) (screaming) - What? - [Jules] What? - He was just here! - [Jules] Where? - Just here! - What do you mean? (screaming) Oh, the doors! (pounding on door) (panting) (metal scraping) Oh! What's he doing? - [Rick] It's petrol. - Oh, my god, he's going to burn us alive. Should we run for it? Rick, what do you think? Should we run for it? Aah! - [Rick] Get help, Jules! I can't move! - I can't do it, Rick! I'm not going. (suspenseful orchestral music) Help me. No! (screaming) - No, no! No, no, no, no! Hey! (explosion booming) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Let's get the son of a bitch. (screaming) - Raffy, I'm sorry. Don't go in there. (gasping) - [Raffy] Mr. Drivett. (groaning) - She found the body. I think she's had a stroke. I've been trying to revive her. - [Raffy] She's still alive? (gasping) (dog yelps) - Not anymore. Come on, let's go. What are you doing? - [Raffy] Why the film? - This sounds really weird, but it sort of makes sense. Martha believed that we created the killer. - How? - He's the character in the film. The only way to destroy him is to destroy the film. - He's not even human? - I don't think so. He's the sum total of all the creative energy that's gone into the film. - Believe me, there was no creative energy that went into that piece of shit. - I've got the keys. Come on. (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) You all right? - Yeah. - Let's burn these bastards. - Mr. Lossman, behind you! (gagging) (grunting) - Oh, my god. Hey, ugly! It's me you want, isn't it? I'm the one that killed you. (Lossman gurgling) Look at you! You're disgusting. You make me want to vomit. Come on, Mr. Movie star, you want to kill me? Huh? Come on. Let's go! (ominous orchestral music) - Well, this must be the place. (pounding) (suspenseful orchestral music) - You stay away from me. - Ah, shit. Is that the girl? - It sure is. Bk 35 to central. Come in, central. (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) (howling) (screaming) Hey, girlie! Get away from there! Hey! - Leave me alone! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - No, don't, please! (screaming and howling) Help me to destroy the film! - You take care of her, I'll go check inside. - It's okay. Calm down. (groaning) - No, you don't understand. It's evil! (electricity crackling) - [Carter] It's okay. (screaming) - Hold it right there! (wheezing) I said, hold it right there! I said-- (screaming) Bloody. Don't move. - I've done nothing wrong, officer. I'm just a simple shopkeeper from Crompton here on holidays with my family. - Get in the car! Everything's all right! - Put down the knife. - It's not a knife. It's only a pair of garden shears simply modified so I can do interesting things like cut off heads. - Just drop it! (gun firing) (laughing maniacally) Shit. - The magic of movies. (gun firing) (gun clicking) (body thudding) - Don't move. - Please! - Stay calm, stay calm. - [Raffy] Please! - [Carter] I'll be back soon. (door creaks) (gasping) (screaming) (grunting) - Don't you just hate that? - I don't know who you are, but you better let go of me right now! - Or else what? You'll lock me up? (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) I'm something special, huh? - Let me out. - Scoot. (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) (thudding) (grunts) (gasping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (footsteps approaching) Now, where were we? (screaming) (thudding) - No! (grunting) No! No! (grunting) (groaning) (grunts) (screams) No! No! Aaah! No! Stop, no! (screaming) Please, no! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Yeah. (grunts) (screams) - Die, you bastard. (howls) Die! (grunting) (Raffy screams) (grunting) (groaning) (grunting) Come on, what's wrong? You a bit tired? Come on! (moaning) Not feeling so good, eh? Come on! You're finished, you B-grade piece of shit! (groaning) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) Hey. Hey. (crying) (dramatic orchestral music) - It's down here. Cor, did you see that? Right over there. (laughing) - Hey, Vanessa, how are you? - Hi, Vanessa. - Hi, hi. - You're looking much better. - Oh, thanks. Ow! - [Raffy] Ooh, sorry. Sorry. - So, are you sure he's dead? - He only existed within the context of the film. When that was destroyed, so was he. - Thank god. Maybe now I can sleep at night. (wind howling) - We are so lucky today. We're lucky because we're here to see the most exciting screening of a very rare film. You may have read about it in the newspapers, because there was this so-called curse on the film, and that was that every time anybody tried to complete the film, someone died. In any case, this print is the only print in existence, and we are really lucky to be able to see it today. All right, nothing more to say. Here we go. Let's roll it.
