"In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides." "In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides." "No matter where I look, I find no one who can be my wife." "Being a good boy doesn't fetch you a bride." "Girls don't fall for NRI grooms anymore." "I'll bow before mother-in-law and also before father-in-law." "Please give us a bride." "We'll forget our parents." "In the wedding.." "In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides." "We advertised on TV shows." "We submitted our bio-data on matrimonial sites." "Before we become too old, we're eagerly seeking brides." "We're suffering the consequences of female infanticide now!" "In our teens, parents forbade us from falling in love." "Now at thirty, they scold us for not having found love." "Neither do they have to cook, nor do they have to sweep." "Give us a bride." "We'll treat her like a princess." "In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides." Give me some flowers. Here. She's a good match for my eldest son. No, that one. How much for that one? Well, dear.. - Give me two of that. What is your name, dear? - Kanimozhi. Give me the change. - Where are you from? Vaduvur. Okay, what are you people? What are you people? - What do you mean by that? She is enquiring about your caste. How does that matter to you? What makes you talk so rudely to your future mother-in-law? What! You? My future mother-in-law? If this is how you speak now, what will it be like after the wedding! No way! I'm telling you now. I won't get my son married to you. Who is your son? Did I tell you that I wish to marry him? Go on. - Wait and watch, I'll get someone better than you for my son. This is what this ma'am does. Temple, pond, bus stand, college.. She keeps looking for a bride for her eldest son. She's a perfect match for my eldest son. Excuse me, dear. What is it? The eldest son for whom this lady seeks a bride is.. He is the eldest son. His name is Paramjothy, age, 40. My eldest son is over 40. - Okay. It is sort of disturbing. - Of course it is. Reduce it to somewhere around 35 or 36. As if that will help! - What? - Yes, I'll do that. That is it. Note that down. Always clashing with the eldest one is the second son. His name is Parandhaman. Age, 38. He doesn't talk to his elder brother. His elder brother has no chance of getting married because of which Parandhaman is still unmarried. And this is the reason why Parandhaman is hostile towards his brother. The best way to describe them both is that they behave like half-brothers, fighting for legitimacy! Don't ask who is legit and who is not! Undeterred by the fact that both his elder brothers are still unmarried there's a third son who is always carefree. The eldest one is 40. The second one is 38. So, you must be thinking, the third one must be around 36 or 37, right? But that's not what it is. Born after a long interval, the 24 year old and the very energetic, Chinna Vandu is the hero of this movie. He has come to this village to attend a festival. This is his uncle's village. Though his native place is Kumbakonam he did his schooling in this village. He's the hero's uncle's son. He can tell us about our hero's whereabouts. Hello! - Stop it! We already have enough problems here. Stop it. What is the problem? Well, the problem is that the festival is next week. - Yeah. For how long do we keep ogling at girls from our village? Paneer's cousin in Paravakkottai.. - Okay. ...is for him and Vellaiamma in Kanammanattu.. I'm talking about her granddaughter. Her granddaughter is for him.. - What! - Not for me! Wait.. Have patience. That girl is for him and the old widow's granddaughter is for me. That was what we decided. Now, he says that the old widow's granddaughter is for him. Vellaiamma's granddaughter was finalized for you. That squint-eyed girl was finalized for you. Leave me. - Stop fighting. Why are you interfering? - Is this your problem. - Yes. I'll find a solution to your problem. What I'm trying to say is whoever jumps over this well at one go will get the old widow's granddaughter. The one who loses, should give up. How is my judgment? Super! Is this the well? Both of us? Yes. - What, yes! He wants both of us to get drowned in this well so that he can elope with our girl. Is this your judgment? No, it's a trap you're laying for us. I am backing out of this competition this very moment! You back out too. - Yes, that's best for the both of you. But not for you. If you stand here even for a minute we'll throw you into this well. - Stop, stop. Wait. Is that Chinna Vandu running towards us? Undoubtedly, it's Chinna Vandu. Why is he running like this? He won't come running without a reason. Do you think he knows about the competition? He definitely knows. No doubt about that. Did you see how he jumped over the well? This is called valor! This is how your grandpa used to catch fleeing rabbits. Your grandpa was very valorous. You've taken after him. Hey, old woman! How do you know so much about our grandpa's valor? Did you have an affair with him during those days? Get lost, you rascal! See! Hey! Buddy, this bird is for you, while the chick is for me. I get it, pal. I get the feathers while you get the meat. I've arrived at the station. I hope my wish comes true. According to my mind game I'll start counting the electric posts that pass by. If the train stops before the count runs into double digits dad will forget old quarrels and he will send me to grandma's village to attend the festival. 1.. Go.. Go.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. Stop! Stop! Stop! 6.. Go.. 7.. Stop. Stop. Go.. Go.. Go! 9! Stop! Stop. My mind games have never failed. The train stopped just before the count of electric posts ran into double digits. I'm attending the festival at my grandma's village! Brother, that girl is a perfect match for you. But that girl is a doctor and you have studied only until the 10th grade. Will it work out? Hey! Oh, no! She is very angry. All of you break something too. The whole family seems to be mad! Let me break this elephant. Is this enough? Fraud! Do you want to break it? - No. Then, I'll break it. - Weren't you the one who had sent people to the hospital? Well.. Ma'am, what is wrong with your teeth? Nothing is wrong with my teeth. I can crack walnuts! I was told that I'll be paid if I say that I have a toothache. That's why, I am here. Dear.. It will upset you if nobody turns up at the hospital, right? Which is why I did that. Is that wrong? Okay, forget it. Forget it. Why did you break that? You fool! I'm a fool? - Get lost! Did you hear that? - Careful, dear. Dad, you do so much for me. What am I going to do for you? You just have to do one thing. Will you marry the boy of my choice? Fraud! Is that all? I swear on mom.. I swear, I'll marry the boy of your choice. My darling daughter! Well, you wanted to attend the festival at grandma's village, right? You can go. Hurray! Thank you, dad. But don't send your men to look after me. Okay? But you should be back on the fourth day soon after the festival gets over, okay? My sweetie pie! What's up, buddy? What's up, pal? What's up, buddy? What's up, pal? What's up, buddy? What's up, pal? What's up, buddy? What's up, pal? What's up, buddy? Oh! What's up, pal? What's up, buddy? Pal! That girl's coming only tomorrow! You may go. What's up, buddy? I have to meet that girl somehow. Why the hurry, pal? Have you forgotten that your eldest brother is still unmarried? What makes you think that I'm going to marry that girl? I just want to check her out before I flirt with her. "No in-laws, no friends and family" "there are no such relationships. - Hail the Lord!" "As a last resort, I sought refuge in you." "Is there ever a calm heart? - Hail the Lord!" "The scriptures sing your praises, isn't that glorious? - Hail the Lord!" "No father, no mother. I've none to protect me." "Hail the Lord!" Buddy.. - What? Why are you praising the Lord now? "Praise be to Tamil!" "Hail! Hail!" "O' Omnipresent one, appear before me. - Hail! Hail!" "O' the one who rides a peacock. - Hail! Hail!" "Help me overcome my weaknesses. - Hail! Hail!" "Control yourself a bit." "If you lose control, our plan will go in vain." Why have you all covered your faces? "Swine flu is all around. - Hail! Hail!" "Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines!" "Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines! - Hail! Hail!" None of you should leave without eating. Definitely, devotee. "She'll come, wait for a while." "Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines!" Why are we missing the beat? Come on, chorus. Devotees.. Darn! "Welcome, O' Lord.." Aren't you Muniyandi's son? Bloody drunkard! It's my cursed fate that I had to wash your feet! Rascal! - Oh, God! Had you warned me, I would've fled from there too. Oh, my! - Buddy! - Yeah? Slowly! The idea of a religious procession flopped miserably. Give me a better idea, good-for-nothings! I'm still not over the oldie's blow and you're already asking for another idea! Yeah. - Isn't that girl a doctor? How about going to meet her under the pretext of an injury? She's a doctor! Not a doctor, she's a dentist. Similar to a veterinarian, compounder, and nurse. Oh, a dentist! Yes, she is a dentist. If I knock the teeth out of one of you I can use that as an excuse to meet that girl. Why are you running away scared? It'll burst only after it reaches the sky. As per my wish, if I touch this tree before that firecracker bursts grandma would forget everything and come to our house. I managed to touch it, grandma will come home! "She looked at me. She looked at me!" "She floored me.. She floored me!" "The wind that blew yesterday" "took my heart away." "She belongs only to me." "She looked at me. She looked at me!" "Shall I express myself with a kiss?" "Shall I wipe away your shyness?" "Shall I let you tug at the strings of my heart?" "Shall I rejoice for tomorrow?" "Sweet as nectar" "you steal away my heart." "Are you the epitome of beauty?" "It rains in my dreamland." "The umbrella of poetry spreads open." "It rains in my dreamland." "The umbrella of poetry spreads open." "Like a milestone in my life" "you're engraved in my heart." "Let's soar amidst the clouds." "She looked at me. She looked at me!" "The wind that blew yesterday" "took my heart away." "She belongs only to me." "In this battle of love" "I'm drawn towards her." "I kick shyness away." "You're the only one I dream about." "When I saw you" "I was left breathless." "Are you the one who stole my dreams?" "To write a poem for you, I shall tear up the moon." "To you, I will give my life." "To write a poem for you, I shall tear up the moon." "To you, I will give my life." "Let the lightning strike." "Let the windows rattle." "Let it rain!" "She looked at me. She looked at me!" "She floored me. She floored me!" "The wind that blew yesterday" "took my heart away." "She belongs only to me." Before meeting that girl, I jumped over the well. Now, ask me to jump over the well. Go ahead and ask me. Be it a river, a pond or a lake I can jump over anything, pal. She came running towards me, placed her hand on my heart and spoke to me, buddy! When there were so many people around, why did she have to talk to me alone? There's definitely something, buddy. But she was feeling sad about some quarrel that happened between her grandma and her family. I have to ask her about it. Buddy, do we have to believe this? Of course. - Okay. There she comes, let me see you talk to her. Hello! Don't eavesdrop when lovers are talking. - Talk to her first. How are you? You'd spoken to me the other day, right? They don't believe me. I spoke to you? Who are you? - Nice shot! Hello! The sky.. The tree.. - The people I end up talking to! Grandma.. - Moon, earth, aunt. We believed you, buddy. Did you all believe? - Yeah. - See, they believed you too. Wait and watch. I'll make her fall in love with me before the festival ends. How? Buddy, girls always appreciate valor. What such valorous qualities do you possess? See it for yourself at the festival tonight. What does he mean? Come, buddy. Just see the way I charm her. Get down. Hanging from the pole like bats! You know, we cling on to electric poles! Greet them, pal. One to the left, one to the right. When brothers from Kerala jump around you all applaud so cheerfully. My buddy, the honorable China Vandu has jumped over Mariamma's well. A big round of applause for him! Please! Nobody's applauding. Shall we scoot? Make them applaud or I'll kill you. I'll smash your face, rascal! Boys younger than you are performing better acts. Aren't you ashamed of claiming recognition for jumping over a well? Get lost! Get out! - Out! Out! I've heard that one is often undermined in his village but it's sad to know that he has failed to make an impression here too. Get out! You can start. Get out! Get out! - Buddy.. Take note of that old woman, we'll deal with him later. Buddy, girls like boys who have a good sense of humor. Where are you going? - We're going to jump from the top and die. At least, use this as an excuse to talk to her! Hey! - Get lost. Hey! Excuse me. Can I talk to you? - Grandma! No. Please don't call your grandma. Basically, I'm a singer. I used to sing well. I spoiled my voice by eating too much of ice cream. The doctor advised a surgery that will make it fine. Can you help me with some money for the surgery? Do you want to hear me sing? Ready, 1, 2.. 1, 2.. 1, 2, 3, 4.. "Quails.. Did you catch quails for lunch?" "Did you bring quail meat?" "Did you catch a myna?" "Did you bring myna meat?" Grandma! - No! No, grandma. Please! Basically, I'm a dance master. I used to dance well. In an accident, my legs were injured. The doctors suggested that an operation can restore my legs back to normal. You can check out my moves and decide whether to help me or not. Ready? Is he a circus clown? Hey! What is it? Just like that, for fun. You'll be dead meat! She was mesmerized the moment she saw me. So, didn't she talk to you at all? - Shut up. Slowly, she regained her composure and told me that some people sing well, but they can't dance. Some dance well, but they can't sing. Those who know both, aren't good looking. She said, I was good looking as well. Didn't I tell you that he'll impress her? Lie! - Who is that? Look at me and say it. Look into my eyes and say it. Did she say that you're good-looking or did the old man appear in front of you with a knife? - What! What a bluff! Didn't I tell you, he wouldn't be able to impress her? Have you achieved your purpose? - Yes. Get going. - No. Answer my question in one sentence and I'll leave. Go ahead and ask. When did you start this social welfare club? Are you asking this question to the founder himself? Seven years, get going now. What welfare measures have you taken for this village in these seven years? Won't you leave without an answer? In that case, let's make a move. - Why? We can talk about it only when some measures are taken, isn't it? Thanks to the hinder some trees the temple procession hasn't set foot in the village in five years. So much for the welfare club! Your arrangements are good, but your actions are not. More than us it's the news about us that should reach a girl first. I didn't get it. Girls like boys who are involved in social service. - There he goes again! We've to make arrangements for the temple procession to enter the village this year. As if that will happen! - Hey! When I decide to work for the welfare of the people, nobody can stop me. Family, relatives, friends and foes.. I won't let anyone stop me. Virtue, honesty and justice are of utmost importance to me. Hold one end of the tape and I'll hold the other end. five feet at this end and five feet at the other end let's cut down all the trees that come in our way! Every inch matters! Just on my insistence, the youth of this village are coming with crowbars and sickles! What a sight! I can't believe my eyes! Chinna Vandu, I'm so proud of you and your friends! 1, 2, 5! Is that five feet? - Yes, pal! The temple procession won't take this route. When I decide to work for the welfare of the people I don't care which route the temple procession takes. Why is he dragging the tape till here? What's wrong with him? Looks like more than half of the shop is on public property. What are we waiting for them? Public property is our property. What are you looking at me for? Get in and take all the bread, eggs and bananas. Hey! - Stop! It is wrong. Chinna Vandu, thanks a lot. It is okay. Just take those things that's occupying the public area. Hey! No! I lost my shop! My shop is ruined! Gone, everything is gone! Hereafter, will you ask us about the welfare measures we have taken for this village? Good boy! You idiot! Why are you cutting down a blooming tree? Mourn, old man! I'm cutting it down for your pyre. You're killing my son! The tree that I had nurtured so lovingly.. This tyrant is cutting it down! What do I do! Don't cut down such a healthy tree. You sinner! Get down! "They hang in clusters.." Superb, buddy! I climbed up in excitement. If I climb any further, I'm done for. I'll cut it down from here. Does this entire orchard belong to us, grandma? Of course! Your grandpa planted all of this. Buddy, this tree belongs to Vanaroja's grandma's house. Dear, not just this side. The one on the other side of the road also belongs to us. So much for grandma's trees! Hey, who is that? The social service group is cutting down trees to make way for the temple procession. Who gives them the right to do so? Give me that sickle! - Wait, grandma. I'll deal with this. Dear! - Ma'am! Did you see my granddaughter's courage? You cut down this tree. The rest of you cut that tree down. This tree belongs to your girlfriend's grandma. When I do social work, I don't care about my girlfriend or her grandma! Why is he standing here? Maybe this is his group. Hello! Stop! I was excited to see the fireworks and I forgot who I was speaking to. Sorry! You look like the captain of this team. Yes, I'm the leader. All these trees were planted by my grandpa. My grandma is very upset. So, could you please not cut down these trees? Were these trees planted by your grandpa? Now, you wait and watch. Hey, what are you doing? Stop the nonsense! Leave out the trees that belong to her grandma and cut down the rest. I'll come back later. Hold one end of the tape and I'll hold the other end. Five feet at this end and five feet at the other end let's cut down all the trees that come in our way! Every inch matters! Buddy, wasn't it your idea of not sparing even an inch? Why are you not wearing bangles on this hand? It broke.. - You didn't hear what I just said. It fell on deaf ears. - No, it's good. I'm wearing them on this hand but not on the other hand. Buddy, I cut down the blooming mango tree in my grandma's house. You watched it silently. Buddy, that's where you're wrong. Actually, we can cut down trees planted by grandma. But we must never cut down trees planted by grandpa. What's with this new philosophy? - Have you had lunch? Yes. I'll leave. So soon? You don't worry. If they act smart, I'll close down the social service association. Is that so? You heard him. Cut down the trees planted by grandmas alone and not the ones planted by grandpas. How about going tomorrow? - No, must go today. She's leaving even before the festival is over. Chinna Vandu! There's no sign of a clown! Here he comes! - Hey, buddy! Come here. What is it? - It's something to do with you. Come here. Shuffle it. You just did that! What do I shuffle now? Hey, have you asked Vanaroja for her phone number? No. - She's at the bus stop, waiting to leave. If she leaves, how will you stay in touch with her? What are you saying? What do I do now? Don't ask me! I'm not the one in love! The bus will surely stop at Alathur for half an hour. If we go fast on the bike, we could reach there before the bus starts from there. We'll give the driver some money and ask him to cancel the trip. If it's cancelled, then there's no other bus until tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, you exchange numbers and get to know each other better. Super idea! - The bus will leave. Hop on! Get down, get down, get down. The bus broke down. We can resume the trip only tomorrow morning! Get down. - Won't the bus go? Do you need to be told separately? Get down. Get down, get down. - Our boss will yell at us he will think we've deliberately hampered the brakes. We'll worry about that later, check the collections first. Why are you so desperate for money? Announce a break down and get the people off the bus. The trip should resume only tomorrow morning. Got it? Here, keep Rs.2000. Take it. Why are you staring? You also keep Rs.2000. You must be the first person to bribe the driver to announce a break down for a bus that has already broken down. Everything should go as planned. Get out of the way. - Go on, sir. You're making me wait for a bus that will arrive late. What if we have missed it? Ma'am, the bus has broken down. Your granddaughter can't go back to her hometown today. She's not going back. She was taking me to the hospital as I had a bad toothache. Isn't she a dentist? Dentist? She is dental! Oh, dental! He kept saying that she is a dentist. Isn't it, dude? Let's go, dear. Sorry, buddy. You wasted your money because of me. It's okay, let it be. Your intentions were noble. Keep the emotions aside. The amount was a little huge. It's okay, forget it. - Usually, he isn't so casual about money. By the way, where did you get the money from? Remember, the trees that we had auctioned the other day? - Yeah. It was the money, we had received from that auction. When I saw you spending so lavishly I had a doubt it wasn't your money. Of course. - So much for the club leader! I don't know what to plan. That day, she spoke to me sweetly, saying that I'm the leader and so on. But today, she completely ignored me. She could've at least, given me a smile. With her grandma sitting next to her, how do you expect her to smile? That too, openly? Open. Thanks! Girls always like boys who speak openly. I'll open up my heart. That announces the opening of the next round! "There are no doors to the Jungle Queen's fort!" "To guard here.." What's up, buddy? What is this? What's up, buddy? Did you pick up just a soft drink? Your body language suggests that you might just break into her house the way you broke into my shop! But let me tell you something. That old woman's eyesight is still very sharp. Thanks, buddy! What for? - For the idea. Did I give him an idea? Hey, be careful! One wrong step and you'll get washed away! Hey! Stop right there! Why are you quiet? We need to make arrangements for the prayer ritual tonight. Peel some jackfruits. So, the old woman can't see without her glasses! She has mistaken me to be the servant. Hi! Hey! What is it? I came to exchange phone numbers. Why do you want my phone number? What are you talking! Only then can our love blossom. What did you say? Love? Yes, of course. And it's no ordinary love. It is an intense love. - I'm not joking about it either. I'm serious about it. I don't love you, I don't think I ever will. Get lost! "Why did you embrace me, if you had to shun me later?" "To you, I've dedicated my life." "Did I deserve this fate? What were you thinking?" "Did I deserve this fate? What were you thinking?" "Why did you embrace me?" "You burnt my heart with your fiery eyes." "Why did you hit my butterfly-heart with a whip?" "My fate is doomed, there's no sign of joy anywhere." "My fate is doomed, there's no sign of joy anywhere." "Why did you embrace me?" In the sword fight, pointing swords at each other.. We enjoy fights, but we shouldn't fight. It's better to make others fight and watch the show. In some homes, if there's a fight happening outside the members of the house rush out to watch it. Two groups have come here to fight. One group says, money is more important than love. The other claims otherwise. Let's sit back and watch them fight. If two roosters fight, we can sit next to them and watch without any fear. But when a bull fight happens, we would watch it only from rooftops. Else, the bull might trample us.. - Stop it! No one should leave this place. My wife's ring, that my daughter, Vanaroja was wearing, is missing. It's worth Rs.25,000. Anyone who has taken it in greed and returns it or anyone who finds it for us will be given Rs.1 lakh. One lakh! We won't get this kind of money even if we work all our lives! Get down and search. Gold is more important than this silly debate! Your boss had announced about that ring, right? Yes. - I'm thinking of looking for it. Can you give me the details? It's round in shape. It can be worn on a finger. All rings are round in shape and can be worn on a finger. - It's gold in color. I'll chop your ears off, bald head! Look at him giving the description! Looks like he'll make one if he doesn't find the ring. Our money's gone! One lakh! That one lakh belongs to us. Start! You weren't wearing this ring when you arrived. Isn't it the same ring? - This is my ring. Had it been that ring, wouldn't he have given it and claimed the bounty? Then, let's claim it. - By giving this ring? Yes. Give it. - My ring! Quiet. How many grams is it? Five grams. - That doesn't make you a feudal lord! What does five grams fetch anyway? Didn't you hear him? You will get Rs.1 lakh. Who will give you so much? Hey! What are you.. Come closer. What are you thinking? If you give this ring to him, he will give you Rs.1 lakh. You take 50,000, while the committee gets 50,000. If you agree to this deal your petty shop will turn into a departmental store. Is it a yes or a no? - No. What the heck! He is not agreeing for it! He meant to say that he agrees. - Oh! No! Idiot, they'll doubt you if you give it as it is. Roll it in the mud a bit. Only then will they believe! You'll own a store for sure! Come on. Actually, I.. I can perform as well. Watch me! Take it. I've found the ring! Looks like he didn't have to search for it much. We can settle it for 25,000. - Shut up and come. Thanks a lot.. Give it to me. We've searched hard for it. Be liberal in your reward. He's watching so intently, is he gonna find out? Thank you, sir. - Wait! You bring me a brass ring and call it as my wife's! - Actually.. Oh, no! - Come on.. Get my ring back! - Didn't you hear him? How dare you fool us with a brass ring! I'll lose it! - He has lost it anyway. Let's go, pal. - Oh, no! With my weak eyesight, I can hardly see. God alone should lead me to that ring. Ma'am, here's the lost ring. Hand it over and take the bounty. Even you could've given it and taken the bounty. Ma'am, that girl doesn't like me. If I give it to her, she might say that it doesn't belong to her. It feels as if God himself has appeared to help me. I've never lost in any of my mind games. I don't have any friends in this town. The next person I see will be the one I'm going to travel with for the rest of my stay here. I only had girlfriends in mind! God bless you, sir! Wear it carefully. I'd sent you here so that you could enjoy the festival. Come on, let's go back home. No, dad. I'll stay back and come along with grandma tomorrow. Please. - The car will be there, come soon. Did you forget that your birthday's nearing? I'm going to give you a gift that's going to make you very happy. What is it, fraud? Surprise! Shall I leave? - Okay. What is that surprise? - Come along! Won't you tell me? Ma'am, that girl does not like me. I like you, fraud! Dude, it's midnight. I beg you. Please come down. Dude, please come down. I will go and talk to her for you. Enough. Stop it. Don't drink up there. At least, come down and drink. Is it enough? Hey! - Okay. What are you looking at? Before the firecracker bursts in the sky if she touches the tree to which the radio is tied her grandma will forget all old quarrels and visit her village. Crazy girl! Okay! I'll apply the same technique. I'm going to jump from this tree to that one. If I make it, she loves me. If I don't make it.. If I don't make it she doesn't love me. Ready.. 1, 2.. Hey! She loves me for sure. Dude, I told you that she loves me. "Hey, belle, serve me some toddy." "I'm all shaken up!" "Hey, belle, serve me some toddy." "I'm all shaken up!" "If you follow me, I'll feel shy." "Unsaid desires will engulf me." "Hurriedly, he organized a competition." "The young boy sweetened my mouth with sugar." "I cried and cribbed." "I stood my ground despite all odds." "Oh, you give me such loving looks." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "I bathed in a shower of delight." "I laughed to my heart's content." "The clothes hung to dry, wave to you in agreement." "Love sparkles in your big eyes." "Our eyes met.. Oh, God! They got locked forever." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "Hey, belle, serve me some toddy." "I'm all shaken up!" "If you follow me, I'll feel shy." "Unsaid desires will engulf me." "As we continue to chat" "the butterflies in my stomach make me nervous." "You create the rainbow within the house." "I hear you, even when the dogs bark." "When you walk by the lakeshore" "even the water in the well peeps out to catch a glimpse of you." "Hey, belle, serve me some toddy." "I'm all shaken up!" "If you follow me, I'll feel shy." "Unsaid desires will engulf me." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." "My heart beats to the drums" "while my mind gently hums." I've promised my dad that I'll marry the man of his choice. I'll tell my dad about us, as soon as I get back home. Don't worry, my dad always listens to me. What did you say? Are you going to tell your dad about us? Instead of enjoying during your holidays, you're worried about love and dad. I never had any such thing on my mind. Fraud! - Just kidding. That's what I like about you. Oh, dad! - You can call him back later. The car must've arrived. I have to leave. What is it? Let me go, I should be going. I'll call you later. What is it? Fraud! What did you just do? I didn't ask for all this. Fraud! How many times will you call me up? I told you that I won't come until you tell me about my birthday gift. Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Hang up, I'm coming. Dear.. Welcome. Old age has mellowed grandma. - We've reached the gates already. What is the gift? There's time until midnight. This is an advance gift. You'll be amazed! I know what kids are up to these days. You've shown great faith in your dad by promising to marry the groom of your dad's choice. See, the groom I've chosen for you won't betray your faith in me. The engagement will be take place now. The wedding will take place on the next auspicious date. You're going to look at him for the rest of your life. Come, change into a sari. - With the grace of the Lord invitation to the wedding ceremony of Madurai district, Thirumangalam Taluk's resident Mr. S. Sundaramurthy Poochandan's son, Krishna and Coimbatore district, Pollachi Taluk, Vadakkutheru's residents S. Poongavanam and Kaveri's daughter, Vanaroja's wedding will be solemnized with the mutual consent of both the families. This is the document announcing their engagement. May the auspicious happen! It's Vanaroja's birthday tomorrow. I'll go at midnight and surprise her by being the first one to wish her. How do you know that it's her birthday tomorrow? I'd seen the number plate on her father's car when he had come for the festival. 121212. That's the girl's birthday. You're a fountain of wisdom! It's Vanaroja's call. - Talk to her. Fool! Oh! Why did you disconnect? She didn't mention about her birthday before she left. She must be calling up now to inform me about it. So, why are you disconnecting the call? 'It's my birthday today.' What's the fun if Vanaroja says that and then, we celebrate her birthday? She thinks that I don't know about it. Now, when I go and stand in front of her and we celebrate her birthday, wouldn't that be fun? Intelligent. - Buddy, it was my birthday yesterday. Did you know that? You never told me! Boys must come and announce their birthdays. But if it's a girl's birthday, you'll find it out yourself! Isn't that so? You didn't hear what I just said. It fell on deaf ears! Perform all kinds of rituals. She is my wife. On her birthday she should see this splendidly decorated idol of the Lord first. Okay, sir. Where is she? The boys have gone to fetch her. She'll be here any moment. Ma'am, it's almost midnight. Sir will be angry at us. Please get ready. Hey! Ma'am is hugging someone! Pass me the phone. Look over there! How dare you cheat me! Ma'am has fooled us all. She is dead! Mark this day. I need to perform her death anniversary every year. How are the birthday celebrations coming along? What! Flee the town? It's good to help someone who's in love. It gets scary only when trouble pops up! Wait! Where are you going? I'm in a hurry, let me go. In a hurry? Chinna Vandu owes me Rs. 77. I haven't seen him since yesterday. Are you trying to flee the town when you owe me Rs. 120? He is the root cause of all the problems. I know that he has always been the troublemaker. Out with my money! - I need to go, please understand. I beg you. They'll be here. Who will be here? - Shall I fall at your feet? Shut up! Give it to me! Give me my money. You want the money, right? - Yes. Instead of giving you the money, I'll take some from you. Chinna Vandu.. - Yeah. - ...was hitting on that old woman's granddaughter. You know about it, right? - Very well. That girl got engaged to a notorious gangster in Palani. That's good, lucky girl. Chinna Vandu eloped with her last night. I'll spread the rumor that you were the one who helped the lovers unite. And then I'll leave this town. The gangsters will collect the bag from you, as decently as they can. Shall I take your leave? - What's the hurry, dear? Only if you tell me will I know about this. You can take this. I don't want the bag. I want Rs. 500. 500? 700. - 700! I deserve this for poking my nose! Hey.. You seem to be already! - Hello, sir. That's nothing. Actually, sir.. My friend, Chinna Vandu and that old woman's granddaughter, Vanaroja.. - Yeah? ...who had come to attend the festival? - Yeah.. - They eloped last night. He helped them in eloping. Okay. He's sending them some money and clothes through me. Keep this money. Take this bag and go away. Go. Pack your bags as well, you might have to follow me soon. I'll come back soon! - Don't come back, get lost! Okay, let bygones be bygones. For now, don't get married. I tied her the nuptial chain on our way here. Birthday celebrations have turned into wedding night celebrations! It's not like what you're thinking. So, you can hear my thoughts! Ma'am, put that nuptial chain inside. The sight of it scares me! Put it inside. Why are you scolding my wife unnecessarily? Don't get him wrong. If my family finds about our marriage it'll create a big problem. Well, that's a different issue. Both my brothers are still looking out for brides. Their hopes of getting married will be squashed if the news of my marriage is spread. In that case, let's not tell them about our marriage. I'm very proud of you. I don't know, how you are able to speak English in this situation. Without letting anyone know that there's some connection between us if only I can take Vanaroja home under some pretext.. He has decided to oust me from the house. Later, I'll plead with someone.. From a good family.. That's quite unlikely.. I'll find some girl and get my eldest brother married. After that, even if I end up getting beaten up, I can tell everyone the truth. I'm unable to think of a plan though! None of your plans fail to get me trapped. Call up home and inform them about the change in your phone number. Also, specifically, cite that I'm not with you. It'll be good of you. - Why? Obstacles to marriage will be removed. The alliance that you searched long and far will knock at your door. This is the day when your soul mate comes looking for you. They never mention it this way. "An angel has arrived in search of you." "She arrived in a golden chariot to weave the clouds into a garland." Mr. Sambandham! Mr. Sambandham! He doesn't feel youthful even when he is imagining! There should be another one inside. Where's he? February 14th is Valentine's day. You know about it, right? Mark that date in your calendar. Your wedding bells will start ringing on that day. "Don't know why, my dreams seem happier." "My thoughts seem more colorful." "Imagination clouds my vision." "Don't know why, a war ensues in my heart." "The buds bloom when the tree is about to fall." "Why is the new moon such a spectacle!" "Somehow, I came across one today." "An angel has arrived.." "Don't know why, my dreams seem happier." "An angel has arrived.." "Don't know why, my dreams seem happier." Today onwards, she and I are going to unite. That girl belongs only to me. I'm crying for you, you must also cry. Only then can we evoke sympathy in them. That is why, I brought her, sir. Enough of your crocodile tears! Crying for an orphan it seems! She will be an addition to my existing problems. It's an unwanted headache for you as well. Take her back. Well, Mr. Sambandham.. Excuse me! Hi! I'm looking for a bell for the new church, a big one. Do you have it? She is speaking English. You won't understand. Shall I call Paramjothy? - Who? Your son, Paramjothy? To talk in English? - Yes. Hasn't he spoilt enough orders already? Do you want a bell? - Yeah.. Yeah.. We have bells of all sizes. You have a bell. But does it ring? I do have the bell. What is the size you're looking for? Big size bell. Big size bell? Was this commotion all about a regular bell? Wait. Big size bell! I don't think he has a bigger one than what he's showing. I should try some other place. Thank you! Bye! Excuse me. - Yeah? - Ma'am, one minute. Sir, she wants a big bell for the new church that is being constructed. We can make bells weighing up to 1500 kilos! I guess, we need a bell that would weigh 1500 kg so it'll be as attractive as you say. Okay, let's place an order. What will be the cost? Sir, she's asking the price of the bell. This fellow doesn't know to operate a calculator. It throws up a zero for all the buttons! - Exactly! Even a calculator doesn't work in this shop. It'll cost more than Rs. 5 lakhs. I guess, it'll be around Rs. 7 lakhs and you can pay, Rs. 5 lakhs in advance and the rest later. Okay. Thank you so much! - Okay. - Now, you've taken the order. It will take six months. - Did you see that? You only hand this over to sir, ma'am. Here. Thank you, Lord! - I'll take your leave, ma'am. I'll take your leave, sir. Okay, dear! I'm seeing Rs. 5 lakh.. - Dear.. That girl seems to be lady luck herself! Why are you sending her away? You can keep her as an accountant. Tell her not to go. Call them. Soori! Let the girl work here as an accountant. What say? You can go. Thank you, Mr. Sambandham! She'll be a good match for the eldest one. Orphans don't carry iPhones! Go and join duty. Go. Which caste do you belong to? Buddy, mission accomplished! But your brothers' looks are worrying. I've made my exit, you can make your entry. - Where are you going? People who get trapped by those who elope and marry.. The hosiery companies of Tirupur welcome them all to a good life! 641601. - What will you do there? I'll stitch briefs for a living! Hang up, man! Silly questions! Why are you dressed up like a clown? He's the second one I was talking about. His name is Parandhaman. Greetings, sir. Thank God, she didn't call me 'brother'! I'm eager to confess my love to you, but if you reject, I won't be able to bear it. I'll get the soot from the shaman and impress you. I'll seat you on my lap and make you my wife. He's fair like me. Come. He's dark like his father. My eldest son, Paramjothy. - Greetings, sir. Did she ask you about my complexion? I'll lighten my complexion and tighten my muscles. You won't be able to resist proposing to me. Both of us will give a befitting reply to that squeaky rat of a brother! You've slimmed down in a day! I've been going to the gym, mom. Hey! Hey! Mom! What do I do? Thief! Thief! I've caught her! - Let her go! - I won't let her go! She's stealing the lamps, mom. How can anyone steal when I'm around? Get away. What the heck! She has joined as an accountant. Go. I'm sorry. Didn't I tell you about the youngest one? He is Chinna Vandu. Greetings, sir. What is it? Are you wondering why he's quiet? - Fraud. As both his brothers aren't married yet he doesn't even look at any girl, dear. Darn the power! I'll find a matchbox. - Okay, mom. Take your time, mom. We had decided to keep it clean for now, right? Like an egg in a vegetarian meal, we can keep it clean with just a kiss. "Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping" "my heart skips a beat!" "If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry." "She will make mincemeat out of you." "Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping" "my heart skips a beat!" "If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry." "She will make mincemeat out of you." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Look at the lady for a while" "and you'll be mailed the fever of love." "Thinking yourself to be a man, if you try getting too close to her" "she'll send you back in an ambulance." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Tucker, tucker, top tucker" "her name stuck to my heart real quick." "Cooker, cooker, she's a hot cooker." "My heart refuses to forget her." "Her words taste like the candy." "Her body, a bottle of honey." "Her costume, colorful like a lollipop." "Her beauty makes me throw up poems!" "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping" "my heart skips a beat!" "If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry." "She will make mincemeat out of you." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time." "Game over." Thank God, he is eating bananas. Instead, had it been soft drinks.. - Did they hear that? So.. They caught you finally! I saw this man sending the money. Interrogate him nicely, he'll speak up. They can be found easily. It's a lie! These poor guys are trapped because of that guy's antics! His family was living in Kumbakonam earlier. I had last visited them long back for their youngest son's first birthday. Recently, I heard that they have shifted their house. Nobody knows about their current address. This guy is a good man. Had he been guilty, he'd have confessed by now. Can you lend me betel leaves worth Rs. 5? Do you think I'm in a condition to give you anything? Take a break and go to the shop. Kumbakonam! I'll manage the rest. What are you doing? I told you, don't get physical. These days, even singles aren't virgins! You're my wife.. But no! Vanaroja.. One jug, two pans, three bowls.. What are you doing? Checking out. I mean, I'm checking the stock. Go and take rest. Whatever you want to check, check with me. Don't ask that girl. - But you know nothing. Still, you should ask me. It's because she is your sister-in-law. Younger sister-in-law. Param, see this photo. She is born for you. I didn't like this girl. You didn't even look at the photo! I didn't like this girl. That's the horoscope. The photo's here. I didn't like this girl. Hey, Paramjothy! Hey, Chinna Vandu! I need to know right now! Should I live or die? Find out! Hey, stop. What do you think of yourself? What the heck do you think of yourself? What's wrong with this girl? Tell me. What's wrong? See how beautiful she is. If she's a beauty what do you think of her? Divine beauty! If I ever get married, she will be the one I'll marry. Take it. Hey! There's no one here. Vanaroja! The bill book? It's there inside the drawer. Vanaroja! It's there. It's there. It's there. It's so difficult to walk on the treadmill without wearing shorts. What happened? - Something went into my eye. It's just dust.. Why are you overacting? Get going with your work. Silly girl. - Wait! What? Why did you scold her? - Why? Why is everybody in this house torturing that girl? I won't spare anyone who speaks another word against her! Mind it! Vanaroja! Who knows which bell is ringing! Thank God, she didn't turn up. I'm very scared. I've to live in this house forever. Both your brothers are serious about me. I don't know what to do. - Don't worry. We've found a bride for my brother. We're going to meet her tomorrow morning. So that takes care of our problem. Okay? Who is the groom? - Make a guess! He's the groom's grandfather. Hello? The signal's weak here, I will come out and speak. He's the groom's father. He is the groom's uncle. Where's the groom? Look, there comes the groom! The groom is handsome! Do you like him? - Yes, I do. Greetings! Take the silver cup. - No, I should be taking this one. No, take the silver cup. - No, it's for the groom. That's exactly why I'm asking you to take it. Oh! I am not the groom. It is him. What! Is he the groom? Yes. Why did you change the groom all of a sudden! - No.. Neither did I like this groom, nor am I interested in this wedding. Ma'am! Had this girl worked out for him, I could've settled down with Vanaroja. Alas! Even if you had chosen me, I'd have rejected you. I don't have a place in my heart for anybody else other than Vanaroja. Henceforth, that's all you get to eat! - Mom! It's porridge. - Darn it! I can't cook anymore. I don't have the strength anymore. Why are you smashing the pans to say that? It's because I'm having a toothache! Toothache? Vanaroja is a dentist. Vanaroja, take a look at mom. What did you say? Vanaroja is a dentist! Yes. Vanaroja is a dentist. He is a neurologist. He is a heart specialist. Dad is a general physician. If your tooth's aching, you should visit the hospital! Correct. Mom, go to the hospital. She has no toothache. That girl rejected you, right? That's why, she's grumbling. We should hire a servant. - Dad! I meant for cooking! Ma'am, stop crying. I wonder who cursed us. My sons are still unmarried. We sell lamps to the whole town but we haven't found a girl to light the lamp in our house. Have you ever gone to Thirumanancheri? We have visited every temple and we have performed every ritual. Have you taken Mr. Paramjothy to Thirumanancheri? Take him to that temple just once. Something good will happen for sure. Your words sound so divine, dear. You also come with us. - Okay. How can a girl propose first? I've been so foolish! When mom's not around I should give her the poems, I've written for her at this holy place itself. Look, dear.. Wait.. Don't light a lamp with another one. Here, use this matchbox. - Thanks. Vanaroja.. All these days, I've been looking at her as my lover. As soon as I stepped into this temple, I've started to perceive her as my wife. Vanaroja. Thanks! Read it and.. Viji, are you fine? - I am fine. Have you come alone? - No. Oh! Is she your daughter-in-law? She is beautiful. See you, bye. Hey, call him! - Mister! Hey! Call him! Excuse me. - What is it? Get going! Don't stand in the middle of the road! Turn left, take a U-turn and get going. The one at the center! Don't wait for the signal, get going. Do I need to tell you separately? That car is still not moving! You! Hey, fool! If you take a right, I can take a left and keep going. Why are you blocking the road like a buffalo! Sorry, sir.. Forgive me! It was my mistake. Forgive me! Don't hit me. - I'll kill you. His pose suggests that he might turn back and attack again. Why should I take a risk? I'll get going. Hey! Hey, stop! Hey! Hey! Why did you have to honk? I honked, that wasn't wrong, ma'am. It's just that I honked at the wrong guy. Drive faster, mister. - I'm doing my best. Hey! My face was here.. His face was here.. - Okay. I stopped breathing! - Oh, God! I think, he has come in search of us. We can tackle him when he comes. What we need to do now is.. I feel ashamed to go out in public. Every passer-by questions me about our sons' wedding mockingly. Stop crying first. You do have a point. What did we gain by giving importance to caste and creed and to the background? That girl is quite good looking. As you said, we can get Vanaroja married to Paramjothy. Dad, Vanaroja is also here. I've taken a decision regarding my eldest son's marriage. You've been doing that for years now! The wedding will be held on the next auspicious day. The girl is none other than Vanaroja. Hey! - What happened? How did you fall? Whom did you ask before taking this decision? Whom should I ask? Well, dad, I meant, you could have asked that girl once.. We could've asked her relatives, if she had any. She is an orphan. What is there to ask her? I have decided that she is my eldest daughter-in-law. Look at her! She ran away hiding her tears of joy. Is it fine with you? Bless me. - Get up. There's no point hiding it any longer! The problem is getting complicated by the day! Will you tell them the truth or should I tell them? What I'm trying to say is.. - You've said enough! I'll tell them myself. - Wait. They can hear it even if I shout from here. Even if I shout from here they can hear it. Even if I shout from here, they can hear it. Even if I shout from here, they can hear it. "Your sweet gaze passes over me, like a gentle river." "The surrounding is covered in mist." "What do you seek?" "Why the tussle every now and then?" "The breeze overpowers the rain." "Like light in a dark tunnel, you spread within me." "You'll bring about a new dawn." "Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river." "The surrounding is covered in mist." "Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river." "The surrounding is covered in mist." "What do you seek?" "Why the tussle every now and then?" "The breeze overpowers the rain." "Like light in a dark tunnel, you spread within me." "You'll bring about a new dawn." "Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river." "I'm yours." Dad, forgive me. Why are you asking for forgiveness, dear? Just say once that you've forgiven me. Vanaroja is none other than the girl I've married. You think you're old enough to find a bride for yourself! Father-in-law.. - Get lost! Don't you dare call me that! Telling dad might lead to something worse than the dream. Mom is the correct person. Vanaroja! Vanaroja! Vanaroja! Vanaroja! How is our classmate, Sekar, now? - Don't ask! They went to a broker to seek an alliance for their daughter. The broker turned out to be a crook. Ruthlessly he showed him your photo. Considering the age difference between you and that girl.. Anyway, there's a ceremony being held for my daughter. You must attend. She has come of age. I'll surely come! - Hello, sir. When did you come? Chinna Vandu, how are you? - I'm fine. What's the invitation for? There's a ceremony being held for my daughter. So, I came to invite my friend. You should also attend. If you're my best friend, leave right away. I surely am your best friend. You didn't come to invite me. Get going. I did come to invite you. Don't turn around. Put the invitation in your bag and leave. - Why is he getting angry? Vanaroja! Come. Come. Do you know who he is? He was my brother's classmate. They studied together. You'd want to know the purpose of his visit. - She didn't ask the purpose. You may go. - Still, I must tell her. Wait. His classmate's daughter has come of age. He has come to invite us for the ceremony. Isn't your daughter as old as her? She looks much younger than my daughter. Exactly! Come out. I'll trample you. Who is that girl? - Ask him when he turns around. What? What is the problem? - Who is that girl? That girl? We have adopted that girl. Nachiar lane is famous for lamps. I've combed through the whole area. In fact, I'm checking nearby areas now. The driver's face is still fresh in my mind. You shouldn't be searching for the lamp shop but for the auto driver. Before dad comes to know about it we're fleeing from home for a week. We'll return once dad has accepted it. Mom! - What is it? Vanaroja.. - Vanaroja? Who is Vanaroja.. Don't be so ignorant! Vanaroja is the eldest daughter-in-law of this house. Can you stop it at daughter-in-law? How should you treat your daughter-in-law? Shouldn't she be treated like a queen? - Yes. Can anybody live in that room? You love your sister-in-law so much. Your brothers are so fortunate to have you! My sons are the best! Hail the powers that be! It's a no moon day. You've been waiting for this no moon night. As advised by the shaman, I'll smear the soot on her right thumb. Praise the Goddess! I need to smear the soot on the right thumb. I need you to unload the sack of rice from the granary. I need to smear soot. - What are you blabbering? No, dad.. I meant, it's pitch dark. Pitch dark? Okay, we'll do it in the morning. - Okay, dad. Apply it now. The color will come out well. That girl will fall for you the moment you smear the soot. She'll nod her head to everything that you say. Let me check once. Vanaroja, did you eat? She's nodding her head, just as the shaman had predicted. The soot's working. Now, instead of talking to her I should talk to mom. Mom! Mom, the secret that I'd hidden from the world all these days.. It's time to get that burden off my chest. Your brother's problem was the biggest burden of our family. We managed to get it off. You're next. Get it off your chest. - I'll do it, mom. Do you know who Vanaroja is? She's my lover, mom. My lover! We both are in love with each other. She fell in love with me the day she entered the house. Ask her if you want, she'll nod in agreement. What do I ask? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I kept quiet only because I didn't want to reveal it before brother gets married. But when you decided to get the same girl married to brother I couldn't keep it a secret any longer. How could I? When your dad comes to know of this, he'll kill us all! He'll kill us! - It's all about your husband, is it? You and your husband can decide whatever you want. But you can't separate us. Why is he speaking my lines? Ma'am, I've applied henna on this hand. But I'm not able to apply it on this hand. Can you apply it for me? - Is this important now? If he hid it, why didn't you speak up? When I spoke about the eldest one's marriage you could have told me, right? He told you? You both have been hiding a lot of things! Did he tell you everything? - Yes, he did. Then bless me, ma'am. That man might see us! Hail the shaman! "With a word, she stole my heart. With a glance, she killed me." "Like water in a jug, I was trapped in her thoughts." "Look at the river matching her moves with the breeze." "The butterfly that got stuck to my shirt, sent my heart aflutter." "I was fine when I went to her.. Something happened when she touched." Stop crying. We'll take a house on rent. You can stay there for a while. I'll call Soori from Tirupur. He'll set everything right. Hey.. Where is Chinna Vandu? Vanaroja is also missing, mom. Just to be on the safer side.. Mom believed brother Parandhaman's story. I'll use that as an excuse to get the eldest brother married. I'm trying my best but nobody's willing to marry that buffalo. Okay, it's getting late. Get going, they might doubt us. I'll follow you. Go. I think the lamps fell down. - Yes. - Let's go and check. Your father will kill us if he got to know about this. Do I have to arrange it all again? I was the one who had arranged it all. Why are you saying 'again'? See, mom. How could it have fallen? We have a stray cat roaming around all the time. That's not possible. Oh, a power cut! No need to do it now. We'll arrange it in the morning. Do as I say, mom. Stop crying, mom. When dad comes to know about his love affair, he will kill you first. Oh, mom.. What do you want now? Eldest brother's wedding needs to be called off somehow, right? Till he gets married elsewhere, dad shouldn't come to know about the second one's affair. Okay? - Yes. What? Listen, it's my responsibility to stop brother Paramjothy's wedding. Brother Parandhaman not going overboard with Vanaroja is your responsibility. - But both of them are deeply in love with each other. As if you know everything! - He told it to me himself. Yeah, right! Keep it. 501. - I get it. Jupiter.. Uranus.. I forgot everything. I need to manage somehow. What is this? I'm scared to even compare these two horoscopes. They're so incompatible. If you still go ahead with their marriage there will be a death in this house before the wedding takes place. Good Lord, protect my husband! Rather than letting dad die, let them not marry at all! He didn't specify, it's me. It was a general comment. Am I right, Astrologer? A petty horoscope destroyed my love! "New melodies shall rise" "new emotions will awaken fresh like the blooming jasmine." What's wrong with this girl? Tell me. What is wrong with her? What is wrong with this girl? Son, where are you going? To hang myself. So, the astrologer's prediction is going to come true. Before you go, can you please pass the curry? The astrologer was talking about you. This girl is mine. Hello? Is it Ms. Sharada? No, I'm her daughter. Who is this? I'm Paramjothy, the eldest son of Sambandham the lamp shop owner from Kumbakonam. I was shown your photo very late. I liked you the moment I saw you. Oh, no! I'm already married. Can't you be careful? - What do I say? Bless me, dad! - You aren't getting married to seek my blessings! - Wait and watch. Sir is missing his daughter a lot. He's just putting on a brave face. I'm a little worried about the groom's family. The Almighty will lead us to her. I'm tired from all the traveling. I'm feeling sleepy. Hang up. Hang up. I'm sleepy. Hang up. Gold prices soar. It's blinding! I've seen this bald head before. Let me get a closer look. A gold broom to sweep the toilet! It must be at least ten grams. Please cooperate a bit. Darn, my finger! Hey, stop! He stole my tooth! Nab him! Hey, stop! - Will a thief ever stop on request? Hey! Give me my tooth. Give me back my gold tooth. Gold is expensive. Return my gold tooth! Give it back! You thief! You're gonna stop. He didn't! My tooth! I'm not going to give up. Hey, give it back! Where do I find a pawn shop in this area? God! It's burning. Gold shop.. Oh, no! You fell down and broke your tooth! It's a gold tooth, dear. Please give it to that person. Whatever tooth it is, don't worry.. Don't get scared. What are you going to do? - I'll take the dung.. - Kid! I'll bury the tooth in the dung and throw it over the roof. Your tooth will grow back. - Kid! It's a gold tooth! The gold tooth is in the dung, catch it! Super catch! - Darn it! Why are you chatting in the middle of the road? Find a corner to sit and chat, or else I'll break your teeth. It's already broken. Get going, sir! Go on! Hey! - What? The tooth is missing. Where is it? Search well. It's in it. That's a rotten tooth, where's the gold one? That's my tooth. Where's your gold tooth? Are you asking me? I'll slaughter you! I'm coming! The auspicious time is between 9:15 a.m. and 10:15 a.m., tomorrow. You can give me the advance today. - Okay, sir. You can perform the housewarming ceremony tomorrow. Thanks, sir. - See you. - Bye. If I go home now, dad will scold me for not working on the order. I've given the money to Vanaroja, take it from her. Okay. - Get going. - See you later. Hey! - What? He'll enquire about me if you take the bike. Take an auto. Congratulations! You're going to be a grandpa. And you're going to be a grandma. No! I don't charge a fee for such good things. By the way, she'll remain like this for 10 minutes. She will recover by herself, so don't disturb her. He told me that the soot will make her fall for me but he didn't mention anything about the pregnancy. Enough of your work! Stop the machine! Look at what you've done! Looking at you getting all decked up, I realized something will go wrong for sure! Stop it, dad. I haven't touched that girl except when I had smeared the soot on her finger. I knew it when you were applying that fairness cream! Dad! - What? Dad, it's not me. Dad! Ask Chinna Vandu once as well. He is as naive as a cow! I know that you are responsible for her pregnancy. Swear by this if that's not true. Not just on this burning camphor, mom I'll even swear by the burning stove. He simply said that he'll swear by the burning stove. I'll do it, mom. Vanaroja! Vanaroja! Vanaroj.. Vanaroja! Get up.. We've found a house. Hi, Mr. Sambandham! Mr. Sambandham.. This scoundrel is responsible for everything! And you were doubting my sons! Why aren't you thrashing him to death? You elope with someone, bring her home and make me doubt my own sons! Mr. Sambandham! Rascal! - No. You rascal! Criminal! Who do you think you are fooling? Do we look like idiots to you! Father-in-law! Don't! Please.. - Get out! Father-in-law! - What? Father-in-law? Are you both trying to fool us! Get lost! Throw her out! Mr. Sambandham! Sir! Who are you, sir? Let her go, sir. - Get lost! I'll escape. Sir! - Leave her, son. Listen to me. She is pregnant. Spare her. Listen. I'm begging you. Please don't.. Hey! Listen to me please, son. My wife died soon after my daughter was born. She is the only reason I'm alive. She's pregnant, don't harm her. I'll apologies to you for her mistake. Sir! - Dad! Sir! - Forgive her. Dad! - Please don't harm her. Sir.. Get up.. - Dad! - Leave her! Listen to me! - Son.. Let her go. Get her in. Hey, let her go! Hey, spare her! Buddy.. Before the traffic signal countdown reduces from 30 to 20 if two people honk at once, you'll see me. Maniac! Are you out of your mind? Is this how you drive? Take a reverse! Hey, auto! Go back. Come forward. Move the bike. Should I tell you separately? Move. Get going.. Hurry up! Boss! Boss, the girl has fainted. Remove the cloth. Boss, I guess the one who is following us is him. Turn the vehicle. Get it off the road. Hey! Why are you crying, dear? I am there for you. If you cry, I'm going to cry too. You shouldn't cry when you're pregnant. It isn't good for the baby. What do you want now? You want me to deal with dad about the pregnancy issue. Isn't it? All right, I'll take care. Why are you crying? Hey! Ask Chinna Vandu once, dad. - He's as naive as a cow! A cow! "Alas! He nurtured you as a brother." "He took the pain to provide comfort to your legs." "A land where loyalty is limited to dogs!" "You've no one here who's yours, no path you can claim.. " Forgive me, dad. - Forgive what? You ruined the life of an orphan who came to work for us! Father-in-law! She's not an orphan, dad. I've married her. Love. Her marriage was fixed elsewhere and so, the situation demanded us to get married immediately. So, we got married. I told Soori to get her a job at our place. If anyone finds out that I got married before my elder brothers did nobody will offer them a bride. So, we hid it. I don't want to listen to anything you say. Take the girl and get out of here. Your forefathers haven't earned all this wealth. I've earned it all. You won't get a penny out of it. Get lost! Wealth? Seven lamps and four pots! You call that wealth? You don't want to give that to my son-in-law? I've built a wedding hall for my daughter's wedding. My daughter is the sole heir to my property which is worth millions. Sorry, dad. Don't talk about wealth! Son-in-law, bring her along. Let's go home. We are not coming. We will manage. Then? Is my daughter destined to suffer like this? Let him take his time to decide. You come along. No, dad! - Come. I said, come. I'm telling you. Come. Hey, millionaire! You can take your daughter along but she's pregnant with my grandchild. You can take her along with you after she gives birth to the baby. Hey! Sorry, brother-in-law Paramjothy. - Be happy. Sorry, brother-in-law Parandhaman. - Is this required? Be happy. Go. My daughter's happiness is all that I care for. If she is happy staying here, I'll let her stay here. "New melodies shall rise" "new emotions will awaken fresh like the blooming jasmine."
