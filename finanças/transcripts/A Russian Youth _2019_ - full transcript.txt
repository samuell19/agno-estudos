Let's go! Louder, louder! Yes! - Let us sit down. - You're foot soldiers, keep walking. Good. Keep going. - What's your name? - Aleksey. Why did you join the army? Have nothing better to do? - I want to do something. - What? Shoot some Germans. Or just die? How many Germans should I kill to get one of those? Does this look like a marketplace to you? Tell me! Hey, what did you find there? A medal? Show it! Hey gunner, are you digging a trench there? Let's go. Wait up! Guys, wait up! Wait for me! "A RUSSIAN YOUTH" A FILM BY ALEXANDER ZOLOTUKHIN I'd like you to do the following... Highlight these notes a little more in bars 6-7. That's it. - Why did you stop? - The Germans will shoot us. What the hell? Do you want us to carry these boxes? I'm not going there. - Let's go! - Think about the horse. It's unable to take cover. Take the boxes and follow me! Some commander! His horse means more to him than people. The horns should express resistance... Grab one! Be careful with the ammo! Look at that. What an athlete! Don't strain yourself. Follow me, everyone! It's an easy job for me. Let's take it from figure 1. And breathe... Get out of the way! Come on! Then the horns enter... followed by pizzicato towards the end. The rain with all this mud is the last thing I need. Wait up... Wait up, I said! Look where you're going. You two! Come here, get your rifles. Here you are. - Stop crowding around! - One at a time. Out of the way, rookie. Hold it. Take it over there. Be careful with the ammo! We'll need it later. Careful! Go into the trenches. Look how persistent he is. Hey, youngster, do you feel like fighting? He won't let the Germans defeat us. Hey, take it. The ammo too. Thank you. You two, come here! Take care of the rifles! There's a drier spot there... What a nice button box you've got! Let me see. - Is that our gunner? - Don't be offended, Aleksey. Play something for us. I'm not good at it yet. - It was a present... - We'll teach you! We've got accordion players here. - Just don't lose your cap. - And play from the heart. Come on, play for everyone. Don't be shy. Sidorenko, help the newcomers! Don't lean out, unless you wanna get shot! We'll teach you everything! Go on... A neighbor boy was playing the accordion when I was going to the war. My mum was crying. But I was laughing. There's no point crying anyway. It's gonna rain now! Are you alive? - Who's that? - Machine-gunners. - Both of them. - Give way! Both at once... Masks on! No deep breathing! Take care of your eyes! I forgot how to put it on. Show me. Bloody Germans! Attacking with gas... Help the boys! Frolov, go show them! Burn the brushwood! Youngster, don't sit down there! You'll suffocate. It's burning, burning... Here come the Germans... Can't see a thing. What happened to the bassoon? Play the fifth bar for me. Stop kicking! My wound... Stop hitting me! My arm! Orderly! Stop hitting me! It hurts. Who's that? Let go of me! You're in the hospital, be quiet. - Leave me alone. - It's OK. Calm down. - What's going on here? - The youngster woke up. - He started it! - The orderly is here. How are you feeling? I need to pee. Let's go. He'll have no choice but to become a beggar. Come on. Let's go. Take off the blindfold! I'll go myself! What? - Let's go! - Stop dragging me. - Mind the step. - Why am I blindfolded? The gas burnt your eyes. You didn't cover them well. I covered them the way I was taught! You were badly taught. Keep walking, I'm holding you. Slow down a bit! Careful. Out of the way! - Stop shoving me! - Iâ€™m so sick of it all! Have some pity for the boy! Boys like him will break my back soon. - Get up! - Quit throwing me around! - It won't happen again. - Hold me up! Keep walking. A bit more. - Quickly! - Hang on. - Let's go there! - Where? Not far. There's a cemetery here. Damn bandages! What will happen to me now? They'll send you home. Why? I'll help you. - I'll manage. - I'll help you! Leave me alone! What are you doing here? It's a cemetery. We won't go any further! He is blind! Have some mercy. I can't go home! Can't even take a leak on my own! Wait! - Why are you mad? - I'm not going home. Don't you touch me. I can't go back. Wait! We need to see the doctor. I can manage myself! The horse... Careful! Orderlies, the newly wounded arrived. You there, bring him over! Let's go. Come on, it won't hurt. I can't see! Come here. - To the table. - The doctor will help you. Don't rush, watch your step. What's this? At least he didn't inhale too much gas. - I can't go home! - Hush! Hold his head. Hold it tight. Bear with it. Send him home tomorrow. Take him away. Go. I can't go home! - Take him away. - Let's go. - I can't go home! - Move it. Bring them closer to the tents' edge. Where the sack is. Yes, right there. A bit further, though. I must stay here! - Can I? - Keep walking. Come here! It's time to take a photo. Go over there! What photo? Look at me! The camera is right here. Can't see those in the back row. Get them something to stand on. I'll be a burden for my family. I won't be able to work! Find something for the back row. Yes, perfect! Let's make a stage for you. Make two rows! Right, get ready! Come on, move. - Those in the back, higher! - Step up. - I can't return to the village. - Stand still. Now freeze! Say something. - Don't move... - Where are you going? Terrible placement, I can't see the back row. What is it? Permission to speak, sir. They brought a young boy from the front line... He was blinded by the gas. - He's strong and bright. - Still, he is blind. Which one? That boy. He wants to stay in the army. Please let him stay here. I'll be looking after him. And what can you say about this? One...! Two...! Get up! Stop strangling him! Is it so hard to stand still? Go. He may stay. Dress him. Where are you? It's me, me. The officer let you stay. Now, go and dress. Careful, step this way. So hot! Smells like bath brooms. Is it a bath house? Wait here. I'll bring you some clothes. - Wait! - I want to wash. You can't do it now. Later. What? Are you ticklish? Put your leg in. What's that? Why did you fall? You're ticklish, aren't you? Why did you fall? Come on, tell me! Why did you fall? Because you're ticklish? Messing around? The blind boy will stay. He'll serve under my command. - I thought he would stay here. - No, he's coming with me. Get dressed. Let's stop for now. - I'll help you. - I'll do it myself. - Let me help! - They found a place for you. I'll do it myself. Myself! Everyone, especially the brass, try to play the passage with real vigor. Marcato must be like... - What am I, a nanny? - Where are you taking me? I can do it myself. I'll manage. Stop! - Let's go. - Leave me alone. Being his nanny? No way. I can walk myself! Let go of me! Come on, boys! Now, my word is your command. Let me down, and I'll give you hell. - I'm sorry! - What the hell have you done? - Don't ever do it again. - I won't. I'm sorry. - That'll teach you. - Please, let me go. - Stand up. - Why did you attack him? Let's go. More articulate! Make forte stronger. - Put out the cigarette! - Come on, we're on duty. Here is our cannon. Wait a second. Why so slow? You should have finished ages ago. Don't stand around, grab it! - Are you holding it? - Yes sir! Hold it! Work on your muscles, weaklings. The horns always have 3 notes to play. But I occasionally hear only 2 notes. As if someone's having a break. Are you tired already? You always need a kick in the pants to do something. Makar is in a bad mood today. - Let's redo this thing. - Wait till he leaves. There's a town nearby that the Germans are regularly trying to bomb. Our job is to listen and give a signal if we hear airplanes approach. - You'll be serving here. - What will I be doing? Hang on. - Makar... - What do you think you're doing? I'm... I'm listening! Give them back. Makar, give me the photos! It's cold... metal. - I was listening! - To what? To airplanes! Then show him how to do it. Come on! You are responsible for him now. - Sit him down! - Can't he do it himself? Is he blind? - Stop shouting! - All right, all right. - What a character! - Don't touch me. Give them back! Oh no... He tore up the photos! Have you heard airplanes buzzing? - Not really. - You'll be able to identify it. You'll be fine! - Can you feel the hose? - Yes. The sound comes through it. Hit the rail as soon as you hear the airplane. Got it. Put your right hand here, your left hand there. Do you feel it going up? Keep turning the handle. Like this, got it? And this way it goes down. Use your leg more. Try! Come on, come on. Right! Use your leg more. Try the other way. Push it with your shoulder! And with your leg. Good. Push it with your shoulder more! What? What for? - Go get some food! - I'm on my way. What the hell are you doing? You can't turn it randomly. But I... Take him away, or I'll kick your asses! Instead of beating me, teach me how to operate it. - Let's go! - Why is he beating me? - Makar, we're off to get some food. - Get out of my sight! Are they planning to starve us? This bloody queue! But not for the officers... Look how they're stuffing their faces with food. They seem fine with the state of things. But we'll change everything soon. It's a secret, though. Don't tell anyone. Hello! How polite. - Follow me! - Where are we going? - Don't jump the line. - I'm escorting a blind guy! I need some food for those on duty. Distribute these among people. Change is coming. Factory workers are with us. Get off me, I'm with this blind guy. - Why the hell are you jumping the line? - Put some for the guys on duty. Gosh, even blind men are at the front now. Here, have some. I found a place for you to sit. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - But they will... - Shut up! Keep walking. Who's that? - Guys, may I sit with you? - You are already. Treat the soldier to something delicious. It's the officers' table. You are so strict. Go sit with the soldiers! Go away! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. I'll clean it. I'm not amused. Come along. Your Honor, have some mercy. He is blind. See? - Stop tickling me! - Hold your hands! Hold them! You! Come over here! Me? Hold his hands. Hold them! - Like this? - He is blind! Let him be. Come! Careful, keep your head down! I can smell the hay. Not there! - My fingers are burning. - Climb up. Lie down. Get some sleep. Your watch starts tomorrow morning. Sleep. I'll be coming for you. Stop hitting me. It hurts. Stop hitting me! Why did you fall? Tell me why. Why did you fall? Stop. - Will you stay with me? - I will be beside you. Tell me if you hear something. A note for the piano... Please avoid strong notes, accents. And the next passage can be a bit lighter and more dynamic. Everything is buzzing. How bizarre... Go and take it. Makar, what should we do? Be alert. Bloody hell. It's coming! Coming! - Stop pounding! - Makar will kill us. - Enough. Give it to me. - I heard it! Was it an airplane? - Makar... - Shut up! I want to hear it too. This way! - Turn it. - A bit more, more! Move it. - Wait here. - Bring some more! Come on, faster! Cover it! Cover it all. Faster! Let's play the next bit, allegro. Two bars. Only two, please. What's with you? Careful near the water! Water... I'm starting to imagine things. You and Nazarka are going to report at the headquarters. You did everything right. That tick is a big one... It sucked all your blood. I'll try to take it out. Almost... And... done! Whoa, easy. Good job, boys. Well done. The Germans are up to something... Can't do anything myself. I can't even catch lice. Cheeky insects. Who is this? Go away. I don't need your help. I'll manage! Come on now. Give it to me. Give it to me! Stand still. I can do it. Myself! The lice keep bothering me. Let's get rid of them. I'll show you how. You have to do it like this... Like this! Now you try it. - Like this? - Shake it, harder! Wait! Give us a lift to the town. That's it. Sit down. In that passage... Bend down. No accents. Highlight these notes in bars 6-7. - Are we there yet? - Come here! - Do you know where to go? - We'll see! Swing your leg. Hello, pretties! This way. Attention! - Are we there yet? - We are. - Was it you who heard the airplane? - Yes! - Thank you for your service. - Thank you! Thank you! - Thank you for your service. - My fingers! Follow me. Our scouts found the enemy advance guard here and there. We need to strengthen our position. We're seeing more and more German airplanes. Mind your own business! Are they all for us? None of them. This package is for your commander. Hand it to him. Dismissed! Yes sir! Look what I did to the German. I bayoneted him! What is he doing? He was getting closer and closer... but I jumped out and... I'm here on a very important business. Nazarka! What are you doing here? There is one wish of mine... Move on. Go, I'll catch up! The rod and reproof give wisdom... - You're no soldier. - Where are you going? Do you shoot with a stick? - He's blind. - Back off. Indeed he is. - He's a beggar! - Poor boy. Leave him alone. Food. I'll feed you. You can live in the church. Let's go, I'll show you something. Or you... Both of you. Oh, look at that. And who is this namby-pamby? - Your friends? - Yeah... - Where were you heading? - To the headquarters. Go on then. Move it. Get out of here! - I wanted... - Go, go! Fine. Flirts... Now it's two guys and two girls. Right? - Come with me, don't be afraid! - Who are you? I'll teach you to play the organ. I'll give you food and shelter. I don't understand. No! Let me go! Nazarka! Nazarka! I'm here. Let's go already. Aleksey! Try to catch me! So, let's start again! You can't catch me! Please make chords in figure 2 a bit stronger. You need to form an ensemble with the horns. Also, there isn't enough bass there. Let's add some bass. - Here he is, finally! - What? You're so skinny that you can hide behind a stick. Alert! Could you play it again? OK, good. Let's start once again. Aleksey? Is it you? Everyone is going to the town. The Germans are encircling us. Come on! Stop. Are you OK? They caught us unaware after all. We need to find the officers. Why is the town empty? Did they retreat? Quiet! Everyone, quiet! Careful. Stay here. - Germans! - Go back! Makar! Turn the carts around! Get down! Clear the street! - Go away, boy! - Nazarka! Nazarka, where are you? Turn the carts around. Take the wounded away! Nazarka! Nazarka! I can't hear anything! What happened? Are you wounded? What happened? The Germans are going to kill us all. I'll hide you. Stay here. I'll come back for you. Stay here. Hide! Nazarka! I'll be back! Stare ahead. Raise your hands. We caught you like mice. Forty-nine... - Let me sit down. I'm tired. - Go away! Mayer, he needs a bandage. Look how tired and dirty they are. Stand up! Stand up. Where is your rifle? Are you blind? Soldier... Check everything here! Careful, it's a church after all. - What's going on here? - I captured a Russian. - So what are you messing about? - He's harmless. Blind and defenseless. Fine, take him to the others. Brandt, help him. There is no-one here left. Let's go! Jesus, you're out of luck again. Give me the bag. Let go of the strap! Let me go. - Let go of the belt. - Don't touch me. Hands off. Hands off. He's blind. Show him the way. Come here. Are you that hero who captured the blind guy? Just go! Nazarka, why did you leave me? Move it! Faster. Guys, wait up! Horns, please: more energy! Make an almost crying sound. Violins, make the crescendo even stronger. As if it's foreshadowing something...
