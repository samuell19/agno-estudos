NINJUTSU TEACHER: Like the fathers of your grandfathers it was your destiny to become a Ninja. From the teachers of far-off lands, your ancestors discovered the secrets of the universe and the means to complete joy in existence. For this, they were hunted down in their mountain homes by religionists, who feared the potential of enlightened common men. Thus was born the legend of the invisible warriors, mountain mystics who guided their powers into ways of protecting the innocence that they loved and the truths that they sheltered. Yours is a legacy of service to those in need, protection to those in distress and strength to those who are overpowered. Your art is Ninjutsu, the way of stealth, a silent means of working your will without actions. Your reward is spiritual growth, the opportunity to be a conscious part of the scheme of totality. Welcome to the family. [HORN BLOWING] [ALARM RINGING] [SWITCHES OFF ALARM] [CLOCK TICKING] [GRUNTING] SHERIFF: You know, one of these days you're going to bust your ass doing that. You know that? Ah, don't worry about me, Dad. Martin goes for two. She makes a shot. Oh! Yeah! Yeah. Remember that game where you made the winning touchdown? That wasn't the only game like that, no. I'll tell ya. Yeah? So was the other one. Remember all those cheerleaders over at Campbell High? Remember that one, Nancy Jones, I think. [CONTINUES CHATTERING] Hi.Hi. What can I get for you? I'll have some oatmeal and orange juice, please. Hey, Donna, how about some more coffee? No way, man. So, what did you and Sam do last weekend? We just went to the movies. Alone?Well, sure. Did she say what she was doing this weekend? I don't know. Why don't you ask her pet spook? He just came in. [LAUGHS] Here you go.Thanks. Mmm-hmm. You're welcome. Donna, don't you think Hank ought to be a little bit choosier on who he lets eat in his place?[BOTH LAUGHING] Hi.Isn't it a little early for this? What can I get for you? Give me the special. Well... DONNA: Come on, y'all. What a surprise. Isn't it a little early for you people to be out of bed? I mean, don't ya'll usually lay around until around noonish? [JESS LAUGHING]MAN: Yeah, you tell him, Jess! What's the matter? Run out of dogma to theorize on? Mike. MAN: Chill out, Carl.MIKE: Go ahead. I got this nigger!Well, let's do it then. No, we're not going to fight you, Jess. Come on, guys. Stop! Mike, please. Why don't you just get out of here? Let's go. We're late. Oh, hey, wait, wait for me. Come on, Carl. Yeah, right. [MEN LAUGHING] Hey, we got them, didn't we?I guess so. We got 'em!Yeah. I'll tell you what, I'll catch you guys later. [STARTER TURNS OVER] What's the matter? Can't get her started? No. Well, that's what you get for buying these foreign jobbers. Plan on staying around long? Hadn't planned on it. Well, Chuck's got a garage right around the corner. You can take her over there. Thanks. Hey, it's Chris. Look, I ran into a little trouble on the road, so I'm running a bit late. No, ya'll start without me. Yeah. That's all right. I'll make it on my own. All right, thanks. Bye. Well? Well, your rectifier's shot, means your battery is blown.Oh! How long? I've got a seminar to be at tomorrow. I don't know nothin' about no seminar, but let's see, we send to Charlotte for the alternator, we go to Raleigh for the battery... I'd say about noon tomorrow. Noon? Great. Look, is there a motel around here somewhere? Yeah, just down the road, about two blocks. Thanks. Well, do you want me to fix it? [SIGHS] [SCOFFS] All right. [HUMMING] [HUMMING] Hey, look who's coming. Hey! Woman driver! Good morning. Hi, Mike. You sure seem happy this morning. Why shouldn't I be? Just four more weeks and I can finally get out of this town. Back to the wondrous grind of nose to books. Mmm. Yeah, sure. You haven't mailed that yet? What is this? I thought Mrs. Revolutionary wanted to get her philosophy degree ASAP. [SIGHS] It's not that easy. Your dad? He's been sick and he needs help in the store. His heart attack was over a year ago. He's just scared of losing you to those commie ideas and trashy people. That is not fair. Fair? Since when has any of this been fair? You weren't always so cynical. Come on, Sam. The only reason that you and I even know each other is because my mother cleaned your mother's house. That's not to say that they weren't friends. They were. I'm just stating fact. What's happened to us? Nothing. I'm sorry. You just better mail that letter. The deadline for next semester is in two weeks. Besides, what other chance do you have to get out of here? If your mother was still alive, she'd make sure you went and finished college. Yeah, I know. MIKE: Well, then get off your butt and do something about it. SAM: I'll think about it, okay? Think about what? Hello, Mr. Martin. I was just talking to Sam about going back to college. No, no, no. You see, we don't give a shit, boy. I told you to stay away from him. What... Dad!She just wants to finish college. Stay clear of my daughter.Dad! It's important to her.What is wrong with you? Get in the back and start stocking. You don't have enough brains to stay away. You can't throw me out of here. Mike, please!Wrong. This is my store and I can refuse service to anyone I want. Just leave!Jess! Jess, please. Come on, come on.This isn't about me. It's about Sam and her going back to school. She's got a chance to do something with her life. Your wife would have made sure Sam did this. Don't let this nigger tell ya how to handle your own flesh and blood. Forget it. Mike, just leave. Come on, please. Come on, let's go. Wait a minute. You can't tell her what to do! Mike! Looks like assault and battery and disturbing the peace to me. Get out, I mean it!Dad, stop this! Get him out of here.Dad, stop it, please! Don't come back. Mike, are you...You get back to work. I'm fine. See you later, Samantha. Watch it! JESS: Hey, listen here. You come in here again, boy, and you'll answer to me. Jess.I got it. I can't believe what's going on. You all right?Yeah, I'm fine. See ya'll later. See ya later, Frank.Bye, Daddy. I don't believe you! I told you to stay away from him. That guy is getting too big for his britches. You're jealous because he's going to law school. Don't talk to me like that, young lady. You get back to work and do like I said. What has happened to you since Mom died? Dad, talk to me! Just get back to work. Oh. I'll get her. Sam! Hey, Sam! You know how those people can get. Not that I've had much trouble with them. [SAM ARGUING] Looks like spring's finally here. Good weather for motorcycle riding. Kind of dangerous though, isn't it? That'll be $4.98. You know, a friend of mine's son nearly got killed on one. A car pulled out and just about hit him. Broke his back, the poor kid. I ain't liked them since that Brando fella rode one. What was the name of that movie? Ah, anyway. I haven't seen you around. Are you staying here long?Just passin' through. Well, you picked a nice, friendly town to stop in. Thanks. SAM: Okay, what's the problem, Sam? Think, think, think. Okay, the alternator is new, the carburetor is fine. Shit! Who the hell tightens these screws? Ah, I'll never get this undone. Damn it!Can I give you a hand? Jess, leave me alone... I... I'm sorry. Oh, hell. Yeah, sure, why not? Hop in and turn her over when I say. This just isn't your day, is it? I saw you in the store. Yeah? Your friend sure seemed pretty upset. Can you blame him? I can't believe my dad. Yeah. Oh, damn. Daddy's got to let me finish school. I'm not staying here. Looks like you're on your way. You know, everything starts with a thought and develops through words. But it's only made real by our actions. Ah, right. Hit it. [STARTER GRINDING] Okay! Okay! Where did you say you're from? Wyoming. I'm on my way to Houston for a seminar. My bike broke down this morning. Tough luck. Ain't much to do in this town. Oh, I don't know about that. Try again. [ENGINE STARTING] Okay, thanks. Sure. Anytime. Maybe I'll see you around. You never know. So long. Yeah, so long. DONNA: Hi, Sam.Hey. Usual? No, just some coffee. Boy, what a day this has been. Yeah. Jess was in here giving Mike a hard time again. Don't worry, nothing happened. Some new guy in town. You see him? Yeah, we met.Kinda cute. Hey, what's up? Oh, nothing. The usual. Come on, it's me. My dad still doesn't want me to go back to school. Look, Sam. There comes a time when you've just got to live your life for yourself. It's tough, but you can do it. I just wish I had as much guts as you do. What do you mean? You went to Hollywood and you gave it your best. You're an actress, Donna. I have responsibilities here. This is your chance to make something out of yourself. Don't settle for anything less. Sometimes I just think it would be safer to stay here and marry Jess. You deserve a lot better. Why don't you come with me? This is your shot. Mommy! Mommy! I'm hungry. [SIGHS] [HUMMING] [SIGHS] Mmm. [WHISTLING] Now what? Am I walking on the wrong side of the road? [GRUNTING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [GRUNTING] [BREATHES DEEPLY] You see, let that arm float a little like it's coming back. Just like an eye jab. Like an eye jab. Keep that arm relaxed. Responsive. Yeah, try it like that. Good, now it crashes back in. Keep that elbow tucked down here over the body target. Let's try it together. I got it.Well, you've got the feeling. When we talk about the Warrior path that we're all engaged in following, we're not talking about warfare. Making war on other people. What we mean by Warrior is one who goes out into the world to encounter challenge. And through challenge, we learn to build up our capabilities to face other challenges. It's not just a matter of learning physical, mechanical technique. What we're really looking at is a whole way of thinking. A whole way of being. A whole way of living. A way of life. The techniques are the means by which we come to understand the principles. They're examples, they're symbols. It's gonna take a lot more than just those symbols, those examples, being memorized to become a truly capable individual in the world. Ah, shit! Chris! It'll be some time until we see each other again. NINJUTSU TEACHER: Think of the techniques that way. Think of them as symbols. As examples only. Draw the lessons from them and expand those out into your fuller, real life. The black belt is an honor, but it is also a responsibility. It's a challenge to make the art your own. We at this moment have chosen to take the part of the Warrior. The one who goes out into the world and willingly faces challenge as a way to develop personal power. Travel well. [MIKE SCREAMING] [MEN CHATTERING] JESS: Yeah, let's really show him.MIKE: Please! Don't do this. JOHN: Yeah, especially my daughter. SHERIFF: We're going to warn you... [MIKE GROANING] MIKE: Please! Please don't!SHERIFF: Get him tied. Hold him down on the ground.[MIKE GROANING] MIKE: [GROANING] Why? JOHN: That's it. That will teach you. JESS: Think you understand now, boy? I don't understand it. SHERIFF: You think this is a bad dream, boy? Hit him!JOHN: Give me that thing. Go ahead! Samantha will never forgive this. You worthless piece of shit! SHERIFF: Do it. [SHERIFF LAUGHING] JOHN: That's enough. No more. For God's sake, stop it! Wait a minute. What the hell? SHERIFF: Dumb move, boy! He's dead.JESS: What? No, he isn't.SHERIFF: Shut up. You take care of things, Jess boy.All right. Get him!Yeah, right. Yeah, come on. Oh, shit! [GRUNTING] MAN 1: Come on, don't let him go. MAN 2: Come on!MAN 1: Come on! Come on! MAN 3: Come on, asshole. You got it. MAN 4: Jess, get him, come on. MAN 2: Yeah, come on, get up, guys. Yeah! Oh, shit! [MEN CHEERING JESS ON] MAN 3: Who is this guy? [BONE SNAPPING]MAN 2: Oh, my God. He broke him arm. CHRIS: Oh my God, I... [GRUNTS] MAN 1: Hey, guys, let's get him.MEN: Come on! MAN 3: Get this faggot out of here. MAN 4: Come on, hold him. Shit! [MEN CLAMORING] Get him out of here. MAN 1: Look out!MAN 2: Look out! MAN 1: Come on, get him now, he's down. MAN 2: He's on fire!Come on, get up, asshole. MAN 2: Oh, shit!MAN 1: Oh, shit! MAN 2: Put him out! Put him out! [MEN CLAMORING] MAN 1: Get down!MAN 2: Get him down! Get dirt on him, get dirt! Get him out! You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be... MAN 3: Get him! He's running away. [GUN FIRES] God damn it! Get up! Get after him! Get those trucks turned around. Get after him before he gets away! JESS: Daddy, I'm sorry. Come on, let's go! [MEN SHOUTING] [GUN FIRING]MAN: There he is! [MEN CONTINUE SHOUTING] SHERIFF: Don't let him get away. Damn it, he's getting away. He's running to the river. SHERIFF: Stop! Damn it, I said stop shooting! We got him. I think we got him. If you boys were shooting for shit you couldn't get a smell. Jess? Yes, sir.Go on back to the motel. See if he goes back to his room. Okay. The rest of you, I want you to go downstream and see if you can find the body. I'm gonna go back and clean up the mess. [CHRIS PANTING] Aw. [GROANING] Hello, operator? Yeah, I need the police, please. Hello, yeah, I'd like to report a murder. My name is Chris Mason. I'm at a 7-Eleven on Highway... I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I'll wait. All right. NINJUTSU TEACHER: What you want to do is stay relaxed. Stay relaxed as much as you can. The tension gets in the way. Straighten your spine as much as you can naturally. Lower your eyelids. Be aware of sounds. Feel that flow, feel that relaxation. We want to look at how the mind operates. Concentration. Awareness. So, take this as a good luck piece. Just remember, balance. Now, you're working real hard but it's gonna take more time. You can resist all you want, but it won't help. On one hand, you've got the techniques. All that I can teach you. The basics. The one, two, three. And I'll give you everything that I've got. There is another important part. And it takes time to get there and that is the eventual goal, the eventual outcome. Total, free, spontaneous creativity. If you ever had to use this to defend your family, it's not gonna look like the training. It's gonna be totally spontaneous. Created there. Now, here is the illusion. It looks like two different things. But the discipline is the key to the freedom. It's all the same thing. It's one art, but these are two different views. It's like we've got these separated. Discipline, the key to freedom. You're doing real well in this now. [LAUGHS]You've got the techniques. You've got the mechanics. Now to make the art you. I get so frustrated sometimes. It's supposed to be that way. It's a part of the training. It's a part of the training overcoming that impatience. Overcoming that frustration. That's one of the opponents. It's the inner opponent. I went through it. My teacher went through it. It's a part of the training. Yeah. Travel well.Thanks. [SIRENS WAILING] Freeze, asshole!On the ground! COP 1: Now!COP 2: On the ground, god damn it! Face down. Cover him.Just try something. All right, cross those legs. COP 1: Do it!COP 2: Do what he says. Hands behind you. Now! Better listen to me. [GROANING] Like that, huh? Been in the river or something? Come on, you like that, huh? You like that? Get up! Come on. Hey, Frank, look what I got. A wet fish, huh? SHERIFF: [LAUGHING] That's right. Come on! Think we ain't tough, don't ya? Come on! I said come on! I appreciate the call, boys. [CLEARS THROAT] Come on. Get in there. Now! See you back at the station, Frank. Good deal. [SIGHS] Yeah, come on. Come on. Get out of here! How are ya, Frank? Come on. [CHATTERING] Well, look at this bullshit! What do we got here? COP: Some kinda Ninja hero, hmm? [LAUGHING] We aren't going to fingerprint him?Hmm. No, we'll see how long he lasts. [LAUGHING] Yeah. Move it, pretty boy! Get in here. I'll get him. Get in there! Nighty-night. [COPS LAUGHING] COP: Yeah. [DOOR OPENS] Dad? You sure are late. What's wrong? Oh, Dad, you know you're not supposed to be drinking. What is it? [TELEVISION CHATTERING] Sam, sit down a minute. What is it? If it's about school... Mike is dead. What? Mike was found beaten earlier. He died on the way to the hospital. Sorry, baby. No, this is some kind of joke! Sam, relax. There's nothing we can do about it. Frank called me and told me. Why? Why did he call you? So I could tell you. Since when did you start to care about Mike? Sam, just stop it! Just stop it! They've already arrested the man who did it. Who? Ah, that young stranger.What? Frank seemed to think it's drug-related or something. This is crazy! Has anyone told Martha? I assume Frank called her and told her. Shit. MAN: Well, brother, look who's coming. And what do you want? Where's Martha? Mrs. Washington don't have time to come out here and... Samantha, is that you? Oh, Nana, I'm so sorry. [SHUSHING] It's not your fault.[SOBBING] Will you take me to him? Oh, Nana, no. We'll take you. I want to go with you, Sam. I want to see my boy.Martha. [SOBBING] How many times I told you? How many? Sleep, baby. Now you can dream all you want. I want to see the man who they say did this. No. We can't. Nana, Nana, wait! They're not going to let us see him. I would like to see the man you say killed my son. [SCOFFS] I'm afraid I can't let you do that. Come on, Jess. I know you're mad at me, but don't take it out on her. Sam, this isn't about me and you. This guy is dangerous. I'm not supposed to let anybody see him. I only have to see him for a minute. Come on, Jess, please. Do it for me. Please. Come on. Okay. Just for a minute. But if Dad finds out about this, it's my ass. Wake up, asshole! Somebody is here to see you. Well, there he is. Don't get too close. He's a stoned killer. [CHUCKLING] Hi. Did you kill my son? No. I was talking about the fight we had, you know, earlier this afternoon at the store. Yeah. [SIGHS] Sam, none of this would have ever happened if you would have just listened to everybody. Right. You are so right. He always wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps. JESS: Okay. So, next time I tell you... I'm sorry. Look, you don't have to worry, okay? JESS: Yeah? There won't be a next time. I promise. You've got to believe me. You poor boy. I'll be fine. Martha. Martha! Wait! Nana, wait. Let me drive you home. No, I'd rather walk. What did he say to you? He says he didn't do it. Oh, of course he'd say that. He was just trying to protect himself. You shouldn't judge people so quickly. I believe him. He said the Klan killed my boy. [SIGHS] They don't kill people anymore. I've lived in this town all of my life, child. Things haven't changed as much as you'd like to think. If you're right, then we have to do something. [LAUGHS] Well, what do you want to do? Break him out of jail? We're doing this for Mike. But he's dead! Nothing is going to bring him back. Well, I am not going to stand around. I'm going to find out what's going on. I was hoping you'd come back. Okay, Jess, what's going on? The truth! What do you mean?Why is he locked up? He killed Mike. We got three witnesses, and he even confessed. Says who? Well, Dad received the call. Do you have it on tape? Sam. Sam, wait a minute. Do you think an innocent man would carry around this kind of stuff? No. You see, this is none of your business. Besides that, it'll all be over in the morning anyway. What do you mean? What do you mean...Sam... [GUN FIRING]SAM: No! Shouldn't that be my line? [STUTTERING] Is he all right? Should be. He'll have one hell of a headache, though. What are you doing to him? I just need some time. He'll be fine. He's so dense you'd need a crowbar to get through to him. These guys set me up. He set you up? What proof do you have? Well, nothing. Only my word. But I've got to find some cops who won't shoot first and ask questions later. Maybe. I could help. We could call my dad. Look, thanks, but I can make it on my own. Okay, sure. But I have a truck outside, I mean, actually, it's not my truck, it's my dad's truck... It's right over here. [UNDER HER BREATH] Can't believe I'm doing this. This is crazy. Come on! Come on! Get in. You can put your seat belt on if you want, or not. Whew, that was close. Do you do this often? I don't. [LAUGHING] Well, I'd say Sam and Jess were at it again. That's my boy. Listen, I want you to finish that background check on our pigeon this morning. Yes, sir. Your boy, he sure kicked ass with that punk. Jess can handle himself pretty well. The Marines trained him pretty good. Jess, where the hell are you? Call a doctor! Shit. God damn it, you dumb son of a bitch! [GROANING] Dad. Damn, my head hurts. You let him get away! [JESS STUTTERING] Get a hold of yourself. Tell me what happened. Okay. I was in the office and he came in. I pulled my gun out.And she hit you! No, no! He hit me. He hit me. He hit me, I'm sure. Then he got the best of you. RC, put out an APB. Put up some road blocks and give a description of Sam's truck. Daddy. No, Daddy, wait. Sit down and take it easy. Move it, damn you! [TELEPHONE RINGING] SHERIFF: Morning, John. Frank here. Is Sam home? I'll see. Truck's gone, right? What's going on here? That kid escaped. Shit, you said this wouldn't get out of hand. Shut up, John! I set up a road block for the both of them. It seems Sam was here. She may have even helped. No, not my Samantha. He kidnapped her. Damn you, Frank. You get her back safely or you'll go down for this. If I go, you'll be going along for a ride. SAM: ...and then you'll be out of here, free and clear. Great, just great. CHRIS: This is far enough. You can let me out here. Are you nuts? I'm an accessory now! They won't do anything to you. It's me they want. So just stop...Oh, what are you going to do? Walk? Have you ever heard of roadblocks? Why did they have to kill him? Fear. Are you trying to tell me that they're afraid of Mike? Hatred and anger are expressions of fear. Instead of facing their fears, people let it control them. Try telling my father or Jess that he's afraid. People get comfortable. When someone threatens that, they lash out. Mike didn't ask for this. I didn't. You wanted to get out of this town, didn't you? Look, buddy. You think you have all the answers. But you would have never gotten out of there without my help. I know this area like the back of my hand! I don't need your help or anybody's. Just go on back to your wonderful life! Wait a minute. Thanks.Damn it! Wait a minute! Wait! Wait a minute! Where are you going? You'll be all right? Jesus Christ! Look what they did to your car. Ah, shit. Damn niggers. Come on. We gonna take the South road? SHERIFF: Yeah. Get in the car. Damn them. [CAR STARTING] Crazy girl. Is that so? Are you okay? Jesus. Can't you just say "hello"? You shouldn't sneak up on people like that. Why do you keep following me, anyways? Damned if I know. You're gonna need someone who knows the area. What are you doing? In-tong.What? Things are not always what they seem. Right. What's that got to do with ruining your clothes? It's a way of concealing yourself by using the elements. You know, earth, water, fire. Camouflage. Come on! We got to get going before they find the truck. It'll make you a little less noticeable. Noticeable? Oh, shit! God, you jerk! [GROANING] God! Stop! Stop it! That should make you blend in a little better. Chris. What? Missed a spot. [SAM SCREAMING] Frank? Jim. I found that truck. It looks like it's abandoned where the Clear Creek crosses 528. Sam, huh? Isn't that short for something? Samantha. Nice to meet you. [CHUCKLES] If you say so. So why did you hit him? Who? That guy. Your boyfriend. He's not. It's been over for a long time. I just... I wasn't gonna let him shoot you. Why did they say you did it? And what were you carrying all those weapons for? And how did you get out of that jail cell? I study a Japanese discipline called Ninjutsu. What's that? It's the art of the invisible warrior. The Ninja. Oh, you mean those little guys who run around in black suits killing people. Not exactly. We learn to avoid violence to affect things without direct action. Training with weapons is just one way of confronting our fears. You don't have to fight to be a Ninja. I never met anybody who could control violence once it starts. You can't control anyone but yourself. [SIREN WAILING] COP: Yeah, we found the pick-up over here on 1093. Why don't you all get the dogs, 10-4? Okay, what have I got here? Morning, Sheriff. They took off down by the river there somewhere. But we got a chance to get them, I think. Come over here. Okay, DPS has got I-10 bottled up, all right? And we're gonna widen out from here. Jim, I want you to go down 2350 and 37. And I want you to go with Jess and I want you to go down to the Johnson Bridge. And I want everybody to stay alert because this kid is sharp. I'm going to follow them on foot. I stand a better chance. You fucked it up last time. I want you to do what I tell you. COP: Jess, come on. Dogs are on the way. Good, okay. Look, call John and tell him to come on out here and pick up his truck and to bring some of Sam's clothes. Sam's clothes? All right. [LEAVES RUSTLING LOUDLY] Think you could sound a little less like a cow? You're not so silent yourself. At least I'm making an effort to blend in. Well, if it's blending in you want I think a cow would be perfect for these parts. [IMITATING COW LOWING] Oh, jeez. [CONTINUES LOWING] Could you slow down a minute, please? Keep up or go home! [SIGHING] That's a fine thank you. Look. I appreciate your help, but this isn't your fight. You don't even know what's going on. I know what I'm doing. I make my own decisions. Yeah, you wanted to leave town so you used me. And you're out, but I can't take care of both of us. I have to do this alone. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can tell you're in complete control of this situation! Look, little girl, why don't you just go home? I'll be fine. All I have to do is head this way. No. This way. We need to go this way. But right around those trees is Johnson Bridge, where they're sure to have a road block set up. [SIGHING] Idiot. [GUN COCKING] Whoa!Freeze, asshole! Hey, Jess! Your fly is open. [GUNSHOT]Shit! CHRIS: Come on. Told you so. [EXCLAIMING] Oh, hell. [EXCLAIMING]Hurry up! Go wait in the car. This way. Here's John. Here's one of Sam's shirts. I can't wait here for them damn dogs all day long! COP: I called them, all right!Hey, I know this place! Sam and I used to come here when she was little. I know where she went! You stay here, follow with the dogs. You come with me. Good luck. [PANTING] COP 1: There they are! Get em'! JOHN: Sam!It's my dad! JOHN: Don't shoot, it's my daughter! COP 1: Come back here!JOHN: Sam, wait! COP 2: Come on, come on. Let's go. JOHN: Sam, it's me. Wait! Sam! Wait a minute. Wait! Watch out for my daughter. SAM: Jess! Freeze, asshole! No, no, please, Jess. We'll go. It's all right He killed your friend! Shut up!What? No, Sam, it wasn't... Jess, don't hurt him. Please! JESS: You piece of shit. SAM: Chris, come on. Stop it, please. Please, Mr. Ross, help me.[COCKING RIFLE] Nah, he'll handle it. All right, okay, get him, son. Watch it. SAM: Chris, come on.JOHN: Sam, get out of there! Jess, please, you don't have to do this. Jess!SHERIFF: He's going for the gun. Get him! Sam!Dad! JESS: Not today, asshole.

I'm not perfect. I'm still learning. Oh, Dad, all I wanted was to make you proud of me. I failed. I'm supposed to... I'm supposed to know how to avoid fighting. Be invisible. I never planned to use it. Oh, damn it! Why won't he let up? Why does he got to make it him or me? No, no. They'll find us. I'm cold. KLAN PREACHER: Let us bow our heads and remember those that are not with us here today. And thine peace be in their hearts and homes. God bless our nation [CONGREGATION MUTTERING] and help us to be a nation. Jess, are you sure about this? Come on, Jess. Come on. Amen. My shadowed brotherhood, my father is dead.

And besides, you could use the phone to call for help. It's not worth the chance. Besides, we'll be there tomorrow. Suit yourself, but I'm starving. You could have eaten. That crap? No way! Now come on. [SIGHING] Self-righteous asshole! I swear to God, this is the last time... [SAM CONTINUES MUTTERING] I can't believe that he doesn't want food. What kind of person doesn't want food in the first place! I don't even understand it. Great! [EXHALING] MAN 1: When they get done that minister's wife said, "Preacher-style"? Remember that old boy, Jimmy, when it come a-hailin' on his old bald head? CLERK: Afternoon, fellas. You get the cigarettes.Yeah, I'm getting them. I'm getting them. Shit. JAMES: I'll get the beer.

Come on, Sam. You're coming with us. No. Let me go. Let me go! Come on, Sam. Come on. Hey, asshole! I'm the one you're looking for. JAMES: Shit, it's him! No kidding, shithead. I'm going to poke him like a pig. Fine. Come on. Get out of my way! Not this time. Look out. Move it. I'm going to kick his ass. MAN 1: Sam, get out of the way. Chris, watch it! CHRIS: Sam!Ow!

Just be quiet, okay? Where did you find that? In the station. Chris. I'm not going to see you for awhile. Take this along as a reminder of all you went through. Remember balance. That's the key. Thanks. Thanks. MAN 1: Are you sure that infra-red works? Got him! Let's get him! [GASPING] I know it hurts. But you have to try and relax. Have you ever meditated?Uh-uh. Well, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Try to look inside yourself. Notice your breathing. In. Out. Focus on that rhythm. That flow. Breathe slowly. Slower. Let yourself go. [GASPING] I thought you liked me. What? I do. I just... I can't get involved right now. I mean, there's a lot going on. Are you afraid I'll hurt you? I've been hurt by more experienced people. You don't exactly have a corner on the market. I depend on me. Just me. Sounds awful lonely. Lonely. But safe. Safe? Is that anything like being comfortable? Well, if this isn't cozy. I wonder if John knows his little girl is playing around with a murderer. Why did you have to do it? Why did you have to kill Mike? Get a hold of yourself. Damn it! Damn it!Stop it! He was just a nigger. But this asshole killed my father. SAM: What? Let Samantha leave.JESS: Shut up, asshole! Get her in the goddamn truck! I'm not leaving. Looks like you're losing hold on your filly. [ALL SHOUTING] [GUNSHOTS] Motherfucker! Come on! MAN 1: Son of a bitch! Get him! You're mine, asshole. SAM: Come on. [CHRIS GROANS] SAM: It's dark. CHRIS: No shit. There's a lantern or something over there. [CHRIS GROANING] Not exactly the Hilton, is it? Yeah. No expensive candy on the pillow, either. You gonna take those off, or are you gonna give me the pleasure? Huh? We've got to close that up. Unless, of course, you can do it yourself. Here, let me help you. Gosh. Careful. Careful. Oh, we've got to get you to a hospital. No. We've got to end this first. There's not going to be an end to this. After all this is over, there's going to be an investigation. A trial. I don't know what to do. I never really wanted to hurt anyone. I'm supposed to be able to avoid a fight. You are avoiding it. Huh?The fight. It's like you're afraid. Afraid of Jess. I don't understand it. I think you should believe in yourself and what you can do. There. That's the best I can do. Thanks. I only got into this after my father was killed making an arrest. [SIGHING] I was really scared. I needed something to protect me. To hide behind. I guess I was wrong. I can't hide. We were wrong about a lot of things. You know, when you're little, your dad protects you. He can do no wrong. And when you grow up, you expect the world to be the same. But it isn't. I can't find my home. I mean, I keep looking for a place that was safe. People I trust. [BREATHING DEEPLY] How could he do this to me and Mike? It's there. It's just hard to find. It hurts. I know. Maybe that's part of facing our fears. [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] JESS: Morning, children! JOHN: Sam! Oh, Jess, please. Get her out of here. You psychopathic bastard. Chris. Chris!Cuff him. How could you do this? Quiet, Sam! You don't understand. Oh, I understand all right! You killed a man! He was a friend of mine. I don't even see how I could ever be so blind. I don't even know how Mother ever put up with it! That's enough!That is not enough! You killed him! JESS: Well, well, well. I don't know where you come off. You think you're such hot shit. Well, let me tell you something, pal. You could never keep her. I know. You see, Sam likes flowers and hearts and shit like that. Guys like us, well, we can't feel enough for her. So say "Goodbye," asshole. This is the last time you'll ever see her. COP: Jess, you sure you know what you're doing? [SHOUTING] Yes, I know what I'm doing! Nighty, night. Let's go. [MEN LAUGHING] Fuck you. [MEN LAUGHING] What are you going to do about Chris? How can you just stand there and let it happen again? JOHN: Chris, huh? Sam, I'm sorry...Let go of me! [CHRIS PANTING] [EXCLAIMING] Oh, my God! God! Chris! Sam, no! Please! Someone help me! He's in there! [MEN CHUCKLING] Let me go, you murderer! Keep your hands off her! [SCREAMING] Chris. It's over now. Yeah, I guess you had it your way! Sam! I'll take you home. Sam! Sam, please! Tell her I'll give her a call.Shut up, Jess! Stay away from her! You can't keep us apart! Nobody can! Jess, let's go home. I want to see his body. Samantha? Samantha. [CRYING] It's okay. It's okay.They killed him. [PHONE RINGING] Hello, Sam? JESS: She's not there? Where is she? Oh, Jess. Where is she?She's not here. That son of a bitch got away. We're driving into the cemetery. But if she's still helping him, by God, I'll kill her! Don't you threaten my daughter, you... Ill kill her![HANGS UP] What do I do now, Carol? He should be over here somewhere. I don't know... COP: What? Oh, shit... RC, you okay? Jess, RC is down. The son of a bitch is headed your way over to Ferguson Cemetery. WOMAN: That boy has got more lives than a cat. JESS: I said drive him over here! He's alive! He's alive! He's all right. We have to do something to help him. Jess will kill him. Look, it's none of your business. We got it all under control. Wait a minute. I came here for your help. I don't want to get him killed. Hey, you don't tell us what to do! Back off, boy. She doesn't deserve to be treated like this. MAN: Ain't her dad one of them?Well, I'm sure he is. This is crazy!MAN: Grab her. Stop.Stop. Stop! What is this? You're acting just like them. Anyone who foments violence is a traitor to the cause. You're in a pair with the enemy of civil rights. But your silence aids them more. They don't listen to our words. Just our actions! All right, let's go. I ride with you. HUNTER: Come on, he's getting away. Damn it. Where did he go? What's this?Must have broke it. Look over here, too. Come on. He went that way. Let's go! [PHONE RINGING] Armstrong here. Okay, sir, just hold on a second. [CHRIS BREATHING DEEPLY] HUNTER 1: What did you see? HUNTER 2: I thought I saw something. [EXCLAIMS IN PAIN] [GUNSHOTS] HUNTER 1: Get that son of a bitch! Get him! Get him! Get him! SAM: [WHISPERING] Think, Samantha, think. What are you going to do? Damn it, there's gotta be something you can do. [ENGINE FALTERING] Shit! Damn it! [ENGINE STALLING] [EXHALING] Shit. Damn it. Please. Please. Please. [ENGINE STALLING] Great! [EXHALING] [SIGHING] [MOUTHING][ENGINE STARTING] Would you like the key? Take it. MAN 1: He's got him now. Just what are you waiting on? Go ahead, take it. What, this? Let me take it off. There. Happy? CHRIS: If you want to kill me, you're going to have to do it like you did the kid. Pick it up. [MEN MUTTERING] MAN 2: Tired of this shit. Tired of their doing this stuff to us. I'm sick and tired of the KKK. We're gonna kick their white ass all over the place. SAM: Stop it! [MEN CONTINUE MUTTERING] Pick it up! Do something, damn it! All right, you assholes, get the hell out of my way! Move it! Stay back. If you want to die, it's your choice. But he's coming with me. I don't need any help with him, Sam. SAM: I came for Chris. I thought you might need the help. Thanks. Get her out of here! Oh, let me go! No! Damn it. Stop it! Jess, stop it! I'm not going to fight you. JESS: Come here!Jess! JESS: Fight, damn it! Come on. SAM: Let me go, please. Stop it! Stop it! Jess! Sam.Jess, it's over. Get out of here! Samantha. SAM: Chris, watch your... Oh, God! Please, don't... Chris, he's got a gun...

I guess we're not going to need these. Dad, I love you. I love you, too, Samantha.
