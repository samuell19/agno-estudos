Get back up. I've just released the water, come. Why did you chain him? Lucky enough that I haven't chained you. He could have run around and fallen into the water. Day, your insulin shot. Better keep them in safe place. "KOY" You aren't coming back, are you? Of course not. See you in three months. Clean up everything for me and leave anything you don't need here.

What happened? We are stuck in a swimming pool. And what is that? I thought he'd take the baby out of you. Who... Who'd take the baby out? Damn, how come she picked someone like you? I'm handsome. You are insulting her. I'm serious. What do I have against those rich guys who were after her? Seriously, I heard that she is pregnant. I would have told her to have an abortion. What would she feel if she hears that? I can't support her. The baby will grow up struggling. I haven't slept for how many nights now? How can I be a father? Aren't you a bit selfish? She is not pregnant. What if she is? Abortion is illegal. Don't do it. It's also a sin. Baby... Day. You knew that? Don't give up. Day, you can help me and the baby. I know it. How are you doing? Hungry. PoorLucky. He is hungry like us. Lucky. Lucky. Open your mouth. Open it. Open your mouth. Lucky. Come on. Open it. Share with us. You... Son of a bitch! You are ungrateful. When we make it up there, you stay outside the house! Don't you wish to sleep on our bed. Eat up. Still fresh. And you? I'm not hungry. It'll go off anyway. The baby would want his father to eat. I love you, Koy. Liar. You can't even take me to eat pizza. I have to work. Always about work. Beg me please Why are you crying? I'm having my pizza now, Day. Do you want to order more? Lucky! "Help" Day. Day. Day. Day. Day. Day. Day. Day. Day. I'm tired because of the heat. Hey, did he do anything to you? It's not a 'he'. Is it a female crocodile? Come on. Come on. Have you done this before? At home, I didn't have a match. No lighter. No stove. I lived in a cave. This was how I started a fire. Funny. So not true. I watched it from Castaway. Take it easy. You have to eat. Let's share. We can't stay here any longer. Gotta find a way out. Day... a little higher. Day. Day. I can't do it! Okay. Okay, Koy. It's alright. Get down. We can never get out this way. We have to let the crocodile up. And you go into the tunnel. There will be a place you can hide. If I'm not around... she will come after you for sure. Koy. Don't be stubborn. The doll is gone. Might have fallen off up there. Hey. You didn't take it out, did you? Day. Hmm? Day. You never want me to have an abortion, do you? I'm sorry. Day. Koy. Come on. Day! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why are you so cruel? Think about it. If the baby is born, and I'm still like this... how disappointed would it be... that his father is struggling so bad? It's not, Day. It's not true. Look around you, Day. How could you be worse than this? Listen to me. You want something for the baby to be proud, you have to do it now. Make it up there. You have to make it! The music box? Koy... You go ahead, I'll be behind you. Hurry up. Are you alright? Day. How many days haven't you had insulin shots? I lose count. You gotta be alright. I... I remember...

So nothing can come through. It's safer in here. Help! Just a kid's toy? Help! Help! Does anyone hear me? Help! Anybody help! Does anyone hear me? Help! Go! Go! Day. Day. Day. Day. Koy. Koy, stay with me. I will... go to the other end of the tunnel. Let's see where it leads me to. Wait for me here, Koy. No! No! No! No! I told you. Enough, just go home. It's raining. Look. Come on, it should be somewhere here. Will my motorbike get stolen? Hey. What's that? Looks creepy. There it is, our glider. You go get it. Hey. Let's go together. How? Should we jump? Look. So deep. You can't wait now? Genius. Come on. Pick it up. Did someone die here? What the hell? Let's go. It's gonna rain. Who did that? Could be a commercial production. None of our business. Let's go.
