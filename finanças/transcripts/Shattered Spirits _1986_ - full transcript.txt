(MultiCom Jingle) (frenetic upbeat music) (bell ringing) (light music) - Brian! Where are you, Brian? - [Brian] I'm in the barn. - Come on out of there and help me pick up your toys. I don't want another scene like last night. And bring your horses. - It wasn't their fault. - What are you doing? - I have to practice and I have to make dinner. - Scotch. Come on. Soda. - [Joyce] Hello! - Hi Mom, dinner's almost ready. - Oh well that's good. Here you go. - Where's my zucchini? - Oh, I forgot it. - What happened to my list Mom? - No don't start yelling at me about zucchini and lists. - Left it on the counter for you this morning. - And things like that because I am shaking, I can't get this thing open, I'm so tired-- - You didn't get broccoli. - Now you're talking about broccoli. You want me to go back and get the broccoli! - Forget it! All you have to say is you forgot my list. - That's okay. (sighs) Oh. Kenneth's teacher called me today at work again, he says we should get together and have a talk 'cause Kenneth's failing everything. Kenny doesn't care about math. I don't know what he cares about. I mean I know what you care about. - Won my debate. Came in first place. - Look at that. Well what did you get this for? - Well there's everything from Lincoln town-- - Mom, are you home? - The hardest part was about Harper's Ferry-- - Mom? - But I did pretty good, I mean out of 100 girls I came in-- - Mom, I'm glad you're here, can you sign this for me? Mom it's for my class trip to Yosemite. - Your class trip. - Thank you. - It's a good thing everybody listens to me in this house. - I was listening to you. - No you weren't listening. - Yes I was darling. I don't have $50 Ken, here. Listen, your teacher called me today. I don't think you're father's gonna go for this at all when he hears about the results of your tests so. - Well. Can't we wait and tell Dad after the trip? - He's not gonna give you $50 if you don't show up to class! Come on. - Suppose he doesn't ask when I show it to him. - He's gonna ask Kenny 'cause he always asks. - Suppose he doesn't ask. - He's going to. - I show it to him, he doesn't say anything, what then? - He's gonna ask. - Hmm, Mom? (sighs) - Ken! If he doesn't ask. I won't tell him. - Okay, thank you. - [Lesley] Brian, dinner's almost ready! - [Radio Reporter] Low tonight will be 64 and high tomorrow will be 70. Weekend temperatures should range from the low 70s into the high 80s-- - We thank thee, dear lord, for this our food, for life and health and every good, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Should we start? - Yeah. Brian, do you want a leg? Here you go. - Let me do it for you Brian. - Have a breast honey. There, good. Oh! (laughs) - What is that for? - Oh! - [Ken] What's that for? - Hi! - Oh, again. Believe me, I am so sorry about last night. I was just so damn upset about losing that promotion, especially to a twerp like Butowski. May I come in? - Yeah you can! - Yeah you may come in. - Oh! (singing) Is this the Mollencamp residence? - Look at you! - Oh, very good, special delivery here. (singing) Is there a Joyce Mollencamp in the house here? Oh, the lady of the house, there you are ma'am. Is there a Brian Mollencamp in the house? Ah not so fast young man. This is for a Kenneth Mollencamp, is he in the house? Are you he, sir? - I'm him. - There you are, sir. Now then, is there a Lesley Mollencamp here? Ah, the lovely Lesley, there you are darling. And finally, is there a Throckmorton P. Guildersleeve here? - That's my real name. - I figured as much, there you are young man. You look like the man of the house, sign here please. - Don't you dare do that! (laughing) Oh Lyle, this is so beautiful. - I can't believe you got this one! Dad this is exactly what I wanted! How'd you know to pick it out? - It's got over 100 parts. Isn't that something? - It's terrific! I can't believe you got the right one! - Well it's just my way of apologizing to all of you for last night. - You don't have to apologize to anybody. - Oh yes I do. - You didn't do anything wrong. - I did indeed. Your mother was right, I was wrong. It was just such a terrible blow. I mean I've been working for that company for eight years but who gets all the cookies? Thank you son. - Butowski. - That's right. Kid takes a few courses in computer graphics and everyone starts treating him like a genius. Well guess what? - What? - What? - Today the genius Butowski, thank you son, turned in a simple plan for a four-deck tape recorder with five cams, can you believe it? - Five cams? - Mm hmm. - You could have done it with one. - Don't open your gift. It's too expensive. - He just gave it to me. - Well we can take 'em back. - Shh shh shh. (bangs) - Well like you said Dad it's not the title of the job, right, it's the quality of the work that you do that really counts. - That's right son. And the follow through. - Hold. - That's the whole ball game son. - Remember that talk we had about follow through? - Mm hmm. - I've been trying it at school and you're right, it works. It works great. - Well, I'm delighted to hear that. - My teacher asked me to go on that class trip to Yosemite. So can you sign that? - Oh really? - Thanks. - [Lyle] So how are things going at school, any better? - Yeah, everything's going terrific. I'm doing a lot better, I'm applying myself and you see how hard I've worked at home and I'm doing really well in school and all my other classes. I didn't do too well on one test but that was the last one-- - What test was that? - That was the last math test I took. - And what do you mean not too good, what'd you get? - Well I got an F on that but it-- - An F? - Yeah but it doesn't-- - Did you know that too? - Yes, he had a sore throat. - Yeah but it doesn't matter 'cause my teacher said it was just like a warmup test, won't even apply for-- - Shut up! - Oh! - I thought we had an understanding, son. But you lied, didn't you? Mm hmm. You haven't been following through at all, have you? Hmm? You really wanna go on this class trip? You really need the $50? - Yeah. - Alright I'm gonna make a deal with you then. If you can prove to me that you know how to follow through by studying your math for the entire weekend, and I do mean for the entire weekend-- - Okay. - Then I'll give you the 50 bucks and you can go on the class trip. That a deal? - A deal. - Alright, put her there. And don't forget, I got witnesses. Isn't that right Throckmorton? - Right. (chuckles) - Alright, let's eat. Did you say grace, Mother? - Yeah, we did, we can say it again. - No no, it's alright. (gentle music) (singing in foreign language) - The doctor the other day. - Not at all, how's he doing? - Oh he's much better, thanks. - Glad to hear that. - [Man] Hey Tommy! - Listen, it's gonna be great. - Hi, hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - Are you gonna go to Yosemite with us all? - Yeah, are you coming? - Yeah, yeah it's gonna be so much fun. - It's gonna be great. - Where's he gonna be hon? - [Ken] I gotta go, I'll see you on the trip. - I'll see you later. - Okay, see ya. - Lesley's playing in the school orchestra tonight, it's her first solo. - Ah. - You oughta come, she's brilliant. - I'd love to. - Good deal, eight o'clock at the school? - I'll be there. - We'll see you then. - Okay. - Okay, God bless. - See you. - Thank you Ellie. (gentle music) camera clicks Ah that's great. Brian, come down here. - [Brian] Dad, can you tie this for me? - Yeah sure. Hold it right there. Ah that's great. - [Joyce] Come on Daddy. - Kenny, come here for a family portrait. Come on, come on, let's go. Come on, give me that. - Dad, I only have one more section of algebra left and I'll be all done, completely. - Oh no no no no come on. - I don't really need to go tonight. - You're not getting out of Lesley's concert that easily. You worked hard enough this weekend, I'm letting you off hook, come on, get up on the top step, let's go. - Ah I gotta get that-- - Come on, come on, hurry up. - Alright, I'll be right back. - Here we go, alright, there you go. Pull it up, let's go. - Dad can we please hurry up? - Yeah yeah we got time, let's go. Alright, let's see. Ah that's good, alright now come on, Mother, get in there. Alright, the timer's on, let's go. Nobody breathe! - Okay. - Brian get down here on the bottom step, here. One step down, that's it. Come on come on come on. Make sure you can be seen through the thing. Come on, get down here. Scrunch down. Alright, everyone smile! Don't breathe, smile and smile and-- - It's not working. - What's wrong with the thing? - I don't know. - Alright, hang on. Nobody move, nobody move, I got it! - Dad we've got enough pictures. - No don't worry about it, I'll get it. (shutter clicks) Oh wonderful. (laughs) - You took a picture of your nose. - Ah but what a beautiful nose. Fix your tie, come on, hurry up. - Dad can we-- - No wait. - We don't have to. - Here we go! Alright I got it now. Nobody move, hurry up, come on! This could be our Christmas picture, hurry up! Here we go, smile and smile and-- (camera clicks) We got it! Everybody to Lesley's concert! - I'm ready, let's go! - Hurry up! We're outta here, we're flying out the door gang. - [Lesley] Careful you don't spill that. - I'm taking it with me. You know when this family gets all spruced up we look like an add for the phone company. (chuckles) - I wish the yard looked half as nice as we do. - Yeah when was the last time you cut the lawn, Kenny? - You said you'd show me how to use the new mower. - What's wrong with the old one? - Grass got too long for the old mower. - So why didn't you cut it before it got so long? - 'Cause. - Come on Dad let's go. - You kept saying you'd show me how to use the new mower so I kept waiting. - You did say you were going to teach him. - Wait a minute, just a minute here. It is not my fault that he didn't cut the lawn. - Well I didn't say it was your fault. - Well, it sure sounded that way. - I didn't mean for it to sound that way. - [Lesley] The concert's gonna start any minute. - When was the last time I said anything about this lawn? Six weeks ago! - No you haven't. - But the minute I bring it up it's my fault. - No, I didn't mean it was your fault. - Well, I'm telling you that's what it sounded like. Didn't it? - I don't know but I have to go to my concert. - Don't worry about it, we'll get to the concert. It is Kenneth's responsibility to cut the grass, not mine. And by the time I get home here tomorrow afternoon I expect this lawn to be cut. - No, Dad, tomorrow's the class trip! - Not with the grass here looking like a hayfield it's not! - I studied all weekend! - Just a minute, where do you think you're going young lady? - I'm going to my concert! - You get back here this instant! - Honey, we're all going! - Lesley! - Oh, that's just great! - Lesley! Well I suppose that's my fault too, huh, just like the lawn? - That's not your fault! Come on, go in the house. - Lesley! - Nothing is your fault! - Dad! - Lesley you get back here! - I studied all weekend! - You promised him he could go! - I also told him to cut the grass, he didn't do it. - I asked you three days ago! - I asked you to cut the grass and you didn't do it! So you can forget about your $50 and you can forget about going to your class trip. I'll cut the grass myself! (door slams) (lawnmower whirring) (dog barking) - That's my dad. He's fixing the lawn. He's not gonna hurt us. (laughing) - Kenneth? Kenneth, Ken! - Mom. - Uh, this isn't your fault. Go out there and apologize to your father and maybe he will stop. - You said it wasn't my fault. - It isn't. But if you go and tell him you're sorry, maybe we can get to the concert. - No! I'm not gonna apologize! (laughing) - Whoa!

Let's go. When we were driving back from San Francisco you were up front with me and the others were all asleep in the back, you remember that? We got clear down to Carmel, you turned to me and said, "Hey Dad, what happened to the luggage?" Ha, you don't remember that? Hey come on son. I wouldn't say this to the others, you know. But I feel closer to you than anybody else in the family. I love you, son. I dunno, maybe I don't say it often enough but I really do. Did you hear me? - Yeah, I heard you. - Hey I'll make a new deal with you. You been after me to teach you how to drive for a year now so if you'll promise to follow through on things, and I mean everything from homework to mowing the lawn, I'll start teaching you right now. - Right now? - Yeah. You got your learner's permit on you? Alright then get behind the wheel. Come on. - [Ken] Should I slow down a little bit? - [Lyle] No no no, you're doing fine, just fine.

Hey, where are the keys? - In the camper. - Oh okay, come here, come here. Come here. Don't look back. - Ow, why? - There's a guy in there I haven't seen in 10 years. Jerry Summers, can you believe it? One of my oldest friends in the world and I run into him in a bar out in the middle of nowhere after 10 years but listen, we got a problem, we got a serious problem here son. - What problem? - Jerry just broke up with his wife and he wants to kill himself. He wants to come out here and lay down on the road and end it all. Now look I feel terrible about this. You know Jerry and I go back to high school. And I could never forgive myself if I went off and left him alone like this. God only knows what would happen to him. - Why don't you ask him if he wants to go with us? - I been trying to get him out of there for the last two hours! Guy won't budge. Listen, you don't remember, but Jerry used to babysit you when you were a kid, he did, yes! He doesn't want you to see him like this, he's too embarrassed, the guy's suicidal, where are the keys? - In the van. - Okay, look, here's what I want you to do. I want you to take the van home and tell Mother I'm okay, I'm with Jerry, I'll be home after a while. - What? I can't drive this home! - Course you can, you drove the last five miles didn't you? - Yeah you were with me so-- - What difference does it make? You drove, didn't you ? - It's a lot of difference! - Now listen if I didn't think you could do it I wouldn't tell you to do it. I trust you more than you realize. I trust you more than you trust yourself. Now shut up and listen. - Why-- - Shut up! Just listen to me. You get home in this van and tell Mother it's an emergency. She knows Jerry, she'll understand. - Dad please don't-- - Look at me. - Please don't do this. - Look at me son, look at me! Look me right in the eye. You're saving a man's life, son. You remember that. You're saving a man's life! Huh? That's it, get going here. Go on, hurry up. Come on. Tell me you can do it, tell me you can do it! Attaboy, I knew you could do it! Now listen. Stay on this road til you get to Highway 118, then you go ea... West, west on Highway 118. You'll recognize the exit, don't worry. You got the keys? Attaboy, alright. Hey Jerry, I owe you one, I'll make it up to you, I promise. God bless! (engine starting) (honking) (siren wailing) - Since you're already pulled over how about coming to a stop? (muffled speaking on police radio) License and registration please. How old are you? - 15. - Where'd you get this thing? - My father told me to take it home. - Don't give me that, where'd you get it? - My father. - Alright, where's your father now? (sirens wailing) - Kenny. The important thing is you are all in one piece that's-- (bangs) - He wants me to say I stole it! - I know that. That's because they're holding him. - I didn't steal it, he told me to take it home. - He's in jail right now. He could lose his job. You know how hard it's been for him this year, you know that. Now you can help your father. He needs you now. - Okay son, we're gonna put this on the record. If you get in trouble again it'll be on the file. Do you understand? - Yes sir. - It's tough raising teenagers. Got a couple of my own. - How do we get outta here? - Through the door. - Thank you. I did not tell him to drive home alone! I'm not that stupid! I was trying to teach him how to drive, I told him to pull over in this parking space and that's it! The kid takes my money! Runs off without my permission! Takes my brand new van, leave me stranded out in the middle of nowhere, and now you're on his side! - I'm not on his side! - [Lyle] Of course you are, you're always on his side! - No I'm just exhausted. It's four in the morning. - [Lyle] I know what time it is! I spent half the night in a stinking jail cell because Kenny lied to them! My own son and the police believed them! I have tried everything I know how with that boy, and what do I get back? Nothing! I get nothing! I get kicked in the teeth every time! Three hours in a jail cell, and I could still be rotting there right now if it wasn't for you. (tense music) He wouldn't give a damn! - Quiet. Don't let him hear us. - You realize he went to bed without saying a word to me? He got me thrown in jail on top of everything else and then he goes to bed like nothing ever happened! - Too confused to talk, he doesn't know what to talk about. - Well he's gonna talk to me right now. Kenny! - Lyle, don't go up there! - Kenny! - Don't bother him! Lyle. - Kenny, wake up. Did you hear me? I said wake up. You haven't said a word to me. Haven't you got anything to say to me? Huh? - [Ken] I don't know what you want me to say. - Well what do you think I want you to say? You take my money, you run off without permission, you take my van and leave me stranded. And look at this place, it's a pigsty. You skip school, you flunk every test you take-- (clattering) You spend all your time playing with these damn toys! All I wanted from you tonight was a simple apology. That's all. Just three little words. I'm sorry, Dad. Then everything would have been fine. Just three little words. Was that asking so much? Huh? - [Ken] I'm sorry, Dad. - Okay. Okay. (sighs) (sobbing) I don't think anybody in this family appreciates how hard I try. Or how much love I have for each one of you. Except you maybe. (crying) I just wanted to come in here and be with you for a while if it's okay. You're the only one I can talk to, Brian. I can talk to you about anything. I wouldn't tell the others that but it's true. I can talk to you about anything. Anything. (solemn music) (playful shouting) Whoa! (laughing) Hey whoa whoa. Hey Kenny! - Can we open the presents? Can we blow out the cake? - [Joyce] Right after the cake, I gotta go to the store-- - Don't worry honey, I'll get it. Kenny! Take over for me. - [Joyce] I'll get it! - I'll get it, I know where it is. Hey let go of that, no no no no no. Kenny's gonna take over. Go on, you got it? I got it honey, I know just where it is. - [Ken] Okay let's go. - I'll be right back. - [Ken] Hey you're cheating, get outta there! - I ordered the cake, I'll pick it up. I'm outta here. - [Lesley] Maybe we should call the store and see if he's been there. - [Joyce] The stores are all closed by now, it's after five. - [Ken] What are we gonna do? Can't have a birthday without a cake. - [Kids] I want cake, we want the cake, we want the cake! I want cake, we want the cake, we want the cake! We want the cake! - Alright, alright sit down. - We want the cake! - Sit down! - In your pocket so. - Sit over here. - Okay. Everybody find a place. Watch out for toes.

Then at two in the morning he can drive himself home and get killed. - [Brian] I'll go in with you. - Thank you Kenny. (murmuring) - You know what they call Saigon now? Ho Chi Minh City, can you beat that? - What the hell are you talking about? - I'm talking about Vietnam man, that's what I'm talking about. - You don't know anything about Vietnam. - It's the same stuff as Korea. - Dad? - Hey those your kids? - Oh yeah. How are you son? - Hey, remember what day it is? - Uh huh. - It's Brian's birthday, remember? - Oh hey, happy birthday. - Happy birthday! Cheers, down the hatch. - We're having a party, come on, let's go to-- - How old are you today? - It's my birthday. - Ah, it's my birthday baby! - We're having a birthday. - Happy birthday! - Come on, let's go to the party. - We'll have a party right here. Come on son, sit up here. - No we're gonna miss the one at home. - You're king for a day. - Yeah that's it. - I been telling these guys all about you. - Dad we're gonna miss it-- - Brian, my birthday baby. - Let's say Brian, what do you say? - I want you to do that dog deal you do, you remember that? - Oh that's it. - Dad, come on, come on. - I'm not leaving til he does the dog thing! (howling) Come on son, do that with me. - Come on, let's see you do the dog. - Come on, everybody do it. (howling) - Hey, Daddy, I got something for you at home. You wanna come see what it is? - What'd I tell you? - Hey Dad we got a surprise for you. - He plays the flute too, can you believe that? (laughing) - Hey we can't have those kids in here. - What kids? What are you talking about? - Okay come on Dad. - It's alright, it's alright Sonny, I got it. Alright come on son, we're outta here. Climb up here, let's go, horseback ride. Up you go. - Look good. - Whoa whoa whoa! Ride that horse. - See ya later. - So long. - You know I tried as hard as anybody in this room to make it a nice birthday for Brian, didn't I? I blew up the balloons, I got the pinata. But none of you knew what that was really like for me because you don't know what happened to me on Friday. - What happened to you on Friday? (sighs) - I wasn't gonna say anything until tomorrow. - What, Lyle? - I lost my job. - What? - Yeah. Eight years with that lousy company and they fired me just like that. - Why didn't you tell me? - Oh you know, I didn't wanna spoil the party. I wanted everyone to have a nice weekend. But I blew it, didn't I? Oh boy did I blow it this time. Now you all hate me. (voice breaks) - I don't hate you. - Nobody hates you, Lyle. - I don't hate you. - Well you hate me, don't you son? - All you had to do was pick up a stupid birthday cake. - [Lesley] Kenny didn't mean that. - Come on son, give me my jacket. - Lyle look, don't take the car. We'll go for a walk. - Get away from me. - Daddy I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. - [Lesley] Kenny didn't mean that. - If I stay here for two more seconds you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life, son. - No. - Look. - Why'd you have to say that, Kenny? - I don't want him to kill himself driving! - What am I supposed to do? - Go out there and stop him before he takes the car. (rattling doorknob) - Hey open up, I left my keys. (banging) - What are you doing? - He doesn't have his keys, he can't take the car. - Open this door! Open this door damnit or I'll break it down! - Open the door! - Don't lock the door on your father! - I'll open it! - No! - I'll open the door then. - No! - Somebody open this door! Open this door damnit! Don't you ever lock me out of my house ever! You hear me? (crying) This is my house! Mine! I lost my job and no one gives a damn! Nobody! The only thing you ever think about is you! Isn't that true? Shut up! (hits) - No, no! - I lost my job! And the only thing you can think about is your stupid birthday cake. - Come on Scotch, come on Soda, come on. Come on. (muffled speaking on police radio) - [Lyle] Good evening gentlemen. What seems to be the problem? - Are these your kids? - Of course they're my kids. - That's a nasty looking bruise there, son. How'd that happen? - It's my son's birthday and we were having a little party here, you know, and things got out of hand for a while but everything's under control now. You can tell the neighbors we're very sorry about all the noise. - I think you better come with us. - [Lyle] Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Are there any other kids in the house? - You can't take my kids! You gotta have a warrant for this. What's your name? - Are there any other kids in the house? - I know my rights and I know you gotta have a warrant for this! - I don't need a warrant because nobody's being arrested. These kids are being taken into protective custody. - Mom? - Would you bring him down please? - I'll get him. - Hey! Just a damn minute here! I wanna know your name, mister! - My name is Officer Pratt. And if I hear one more word out of you, somebody will be arrested and it's you. - Brian, you can't take everything. Come on. - I can't take a chance on leaving these kids here. Not if they might get hurt. So I'm going to place them into foster care until you come to court. A detective will call you in the morning and explain the whole procedure, okay? - No no no, don't take Brian, he's just a baby. - Are we going to jail? - No son, you're not going to jail. We're going to take you over to a nice lady's house with lots of kids. You'll be safe there. - Bye Dad. - Don't take my baby. - [Officer Pratt] You stay right where you are. (muffled speaking on police radio) - Kenny. Listen, I know how scary this is. I know, but you do everything they tell you, and you be good, okay? And I'll be down there as soon as I can to get you, I love you. - Bye Mom. - Mommy loves you. I love you. - We'll be right down to get you! It's all a big mistake! They got no right to do this! It's all a big mistake, you hear me? I'm coming right behind you! You got nothing to worry about, you hear me? Wait! Wait for me! I'm coming right behind you! Wait a minute! Don't worry about a thing! You got nothing to worry about! Kenny! Wait for me! They took my baby! They took my baby! They took my baby! - Annie, you want a sandwich? No, Jack? - I don't wanna miss any more school, Kenny. I told Brian exactly what to say when the detective comes. We're gonna tell him that you fell down the stairs and Brian's friends tore up the house, okay? Unless you wanna stay in a foster home for the rest of your life. Kenny. Kenny. - You didn't eat, Kenny. - I'm not very hungry. - You worried about going to court? - I'm worried about going home. Dad's gonna kill me for this. - If you're scared to go home you should tell the detective. - Oh no. No way. My dad's mad enough as it is. - Listen, Kenny. The detective, the judge, the court, they're all there to help you. But you know nobody's gonna help you and nothing's gonna change if you don't tell the truth. - Mr. and Mrs. Mollencamp? - Yes sir. - Hi, I'm Detective Perlman. - Have you seen our children? - Yes, I just came from there, they're doing fine. - Oh, good. - Okay listen now before we all talk I think I'd like to spend just a couple of moments with Mrs. Mollencamp alone. - Yeah well you know she's pretty upset right now. I think I can tell you what happened better than she can. - Okay it'll only take a few minutes. Why don't you just sit down, relax. Come this way please? - Me? - Yes. - Joyce? - Oh, yeah. You will never find a better father than Lyle. He loves his children, he really does. Look, this is the summer that he took us up to Brule Lake and he's teaching Brian to swim. (laughs) - Sounds like Lyle's father of the year. - He's a wonderful father. You're basing this whole thing on one incident. And it isn't us. I mean we are a good family, we're a really good family. - Then why is Kenny scared to go home? - What? (sighs) Did he say that? Did he say why? - Yeah, because he's afraid of his father, especially when he's been drinking. - That's crazy. Lyle doesn't drink that much. - Okay on the rare occasion when Lyle might have a little bit too much to drink, what's he like? - Um... Oh well he's loud, he shouts, he throws things. You know how people are. - Mrs. Mollencamp. Was someone in your family an alcoholic? - Lyle is not an alcoholic. - Well can he control it, does he know when to stop? Did one of your parents drink too much? - You mean my father. - Do you remember what it was like back then? Do you remember what you felt as a child? Mrs. Mollencamp, everything you felt back then watching your father run around the house drunk your kids are feeling right now. - I don't know what to do. - Okay, how many of you have been here before? Just a few of you, right? Okay this is a court for kids. And the most important thing I want you to remember today is that no matter what happened at home that caused you to be here, it is not your fault. Whatever happened, this court is here to protect you. To see to it that it does not happen again. Now this is a closed court, which means there won't be anybody in that courtroom that is not directly involved with your case. So you know you've got nothing to worry about. Now before you go out there, each of you is going to talk to a lawyer. How many of you know what a lawyer is? Good. Very good. Now who wants to go first? Right, that's what I thought, nobody. And when you go into the courtroom, you're going to be heard by a judge. He will be the person sitting right there. How many of you know what a judge does in court? Good. Okay. The judge is the one person in that courtroom that's gonna make sure that everything that is said and done is fair. So you have nothing to worry about. - Mom. - Mr. Mollencamp, according to the reports you have quite a history of substance abuse. This past year you had two driving incidents involving alcohol and this is the second time the police have been called to your home for a domestic dispute. (clears throat) - Well your honor. Excuse me, your honor. I'll be the first to admit we have some problems, there's no question about that. But substance abuse is not one of them. - Well your wife and your son Kenny don't agree. Kenny wants to remain out of the home until you stop drinking. - That's what I hear your honor but that's not a problem. I haven't had a drink since these kids were taken away from us. Have I, hon? - What? - [Judge] I didn't hear that, Mrs. Mollencamp. - She said no, your honor. - Well until we can look into this a little further I'm going to honor your son's request. What are the department's recommendations for the other minors? - Your honor, the department would like all of the minors to remain out of the home until Mr. Mollencamp receives treatment for his substance abuse problem. - But there is no problem, your honor. Maybe you didn't hear me, but I said I haven't had a drink since these kids were taken away from us. - [Judge] How do you children feel about the department's recommendation? - Well I wanna go home. I've already missed three days of school. - I wanna go home too. - You see your honor, there's no reason in the world why these kids can't go home with us right now. - Mr. Mollencamp, the last thing I want to do is break up your family. But the only way I'm willing to send these children home is if you're willing to move out. - I beg your pardon, your honor. - [Judge] You'll have to move out. - Uh, excuse me. (clears throat) Your honor, I don't think you understand this family. No, you don't understand us at all. I sat out there in the hall practically all morning and I saw a lot of the kinds of people maybe you're used to dealing with. And I dunno, maybe some of them should be broken up, you know, those families, but I can assure you your honor that we're not like them. - Mr. Mollencamp, I say again. The only way I am willing to send these children home is if you are willing to move out. - Alright your honor, alright, I'll move out. I mean if that's the only way my kids can get back in their own house I'll do it, but if I may say your honor I think this is a big mistake. You know my son, my oldest son here, has some very serious problems and he needs my help. - In addition to remaining out of the home I am ordering you to attend weekly AA meetings. I am also ordering you and your family to begin counseling immediately. You may see your family outside the home. You may not return home even to visit without the approval of Dr. Mavis Foreman. - Hi. - Hi. I couldn't find your shirt with the blue stripes. - [Lyle] I think it's at the dry cleaners. - Oh. - [Lyle] Did you find the gray one? - Yeah. Lesley made you some sandwiches. - Alright. - Can I help you? - Nah, it's okay. I'm upstairs, number three. - Okay, yeah. - You in a hurry? - Oh I should go feed the kids is all. - Yeah. Okay. Say listen. I just wanna say I think it's a pretty sorry day when a judge can call a man a drunk in front of his own family. - She didn't call you a drunk. - Yeah, I know, she said I had a substance abuse problem. God I hate that phrase. If they're gonna call me a drunk, just call me a drunk! - Nobody is calling you a drunk. - Thank Lesley for me. - Okay. - I'll see ya. I'll see ya. - Well I think if he had a lot less trouble at work, if he had a really good friend, and if we had more money that he wouldn't drink. - I think it's mostly me. You know my grades and stuff. Skipping school, stuff like that. - I think sometimes he drinks for little reasons. Like if the house is a mess. - Yeah and I think it's because, um, I'm too loud in the pool. - So you think that if he had the most perfect job and perfect children and perfect house and plenty of money, he'd stop drinking. - I think if (clears throat) some of the pressure was off of him, yeah, it would be true, yeah. - Well, let me tell you something. You know it wouldn't make any difference at all. See you don't make him drink. None of you. He drinks because he's an alcoholic, and the only person that can stop him from drinking is himself. - My dad's not an alcoholic. - Yeah I don't think he is either. - Well neither does he. Look it's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an alcoholic. I don't drink anymore. But I'm an alcoholic. It took me five years of getting drunk every night and ruining my family before I would admit it, before we could start making some changes. - Hi. - [Girl] Hi. - What are you doing here? - I feel bad 'cause I studied ballet all year and my friends were there and liked it except my mom didn't show up because she was drinking. And I felt really bad and stuff. - And I feel bad because my dad never shows up for my soccer games. - It's getting worse every day. This evening I had to sneak out of my own house to get here. It's a joke, it was awful. - I've tried doing that. Pouring my dad's booze down the drain. I have to be real careful when I do that. - I didn't know you did that. - Neither does he. - Lyle. - Oh hi Fred. - How are ya? - Okay. - You're a long way from town, aren't ya? - Yeah to tell you the truth I was hoping I wouldn't run into anyone I knew. - Well so much for that huh? - Yeah. I got a DWI and the judge said I gotta attend a couple of these meetings or I lose my license. Oh by the way I got this card from the court. Where do I get it signed? - Well I'm the secretary, I'll sign it for you after the meeting. It's good to have you with us. See you back inside. - Come on Brian, show me how to do it. - Come on Brian. - There you go, there you go! (laughing) - Ah, so many pins! Congratulations Throckmorton! You've done it again! - Good job. Hey Kenneth, you're up, Kenny! He can't hear over those machines. - I thought this was supposed to be a family visit. - It is! It's okay, I'll play without him. - Yeah, you go. - I'm gonna find out what's wrong. - I'll play Kenny's turn, Dad. - You go again then Brian. - Hey listen. I'm just as sick of bowling and miniature golf as you are, and I know a month is a long time, but until I'm allowed to start visiting at home this is all I got. Come on, why don't you join us? - Okay just hang on one second. - Oh good, he's coming back, okay. Lyle, come on, it's your turn. Come on! - It's your turn! - Dad, ready? - Dad, help me. - You're up, Dad. - Help me Dad! Dad! - What are you doing? Come on. - Lyle. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - Help me, Dad! Dad! - Cindy. Cindy. Let me get about five of those sodas. - No, Lesley. Honey. - Thank you. - What are you doing? - Hey, just in time. Sodas for everybody. One for you, one for Brian, and one for Mother. - Thanks. - Thank you. How much I owe you? - $3 even. - There you go. Thanks a lot. Here you go. Whoa! (laughing) - Oh I lost my game. - What do you do at home? - I cook and clean up. Do the laundry, stuff like that. - What do you do for fun, Lesley? - I have my friends. - Do you ever bring them home? - No. - What about you Kenny? Do you ever bring friends home? - Last time I brought my friends home my dad got mad and he got drunk and threw 'em all out. - When was that? - [Ken] When we got the croquet set. - Kenny that was three years ago. - That was the last time I brought any friends home. - I once heard a guy talk about how he robbed houses to supply his drinking habit. And I thought, my god, I was a bigger thief than he ever thought of being. Because I robbed my family of the greatest gift of all, something money can't buy. And that was the gift of me. The gift of understanding, compassion, love. You know, if you drink long enough and hard enough you either die, go insane, or you join AA. (laughing) - Hi you guys. - Hi. - Hi Brian. You know you guys better turn that off 'cause we're gonna eat soon, okay? - [Brian] They're staying for dinner. Mom said it was okay. - Okay, see you later. (laughing) Hi. - Hi, hi. - What are you guys doing? - She's helping him study. - Logarithms. - Oh it's my favorite, I love logarithms. (laughing) - How was your day? - I've got a terrible headache. I had a student council meeting today, I had to run track, I didn't even have time to think about my school newspaper article. Thanks. - One, two. - What's this? - Oh it's corned beef. - Should we cook it a little bit lower? - No no no, leave it like it is. - Maybe I should take some of this for Dad or make him sandwiches or something. - Great, he'd love that. He likes it when you come to visit him you know seven weeks is a long time. What are you doing? - Oh I thought some of this would be nice. - Well it would be nice but we don't need that luckily. It's okay, I'm cooking. - You don't need it? - No I don't need it. Why don't you go and relax? - I was just trying to help. - Three, four, five here, is that it? - Yeah. - Does that work? - Yeah. (laughing) - Lesley? - [Lesley] Mom I don't have time to talk right now. Have my debate coming up. I have to study this for The Sound of Music. It's Dad's favorite play you know, I'm really hoping to get the lead. - Mm, I know. He's gonna come and see you whether you get the lead or not. - Look I really don't have time to talk right now. I have to memorize all my lines. - Well, if you need any help, I'm here. - Hello Carl. - Lyle. Hey. How are ya? - Fine, thanks. - How's the kids? - Very well. - Good, good. And Joyce? - Yeah she's fine too, thanks. - Fine. - Say listen, Carl. When you laid me off two months ago I was pretty nasty about it and I want to apologize. - Oh well you know it wasn't easy for either of us. - No of course not but I understand why you did it and frankly, if I were you I would have done exactly the same thing. Because I realize that I'm an alcoholic, Carl. But I got it licked now, I really do. I been going to AA. I haven't had a drop since I left this place. I even signed up for a course in computer graphics. I'm trying to pull my life back together again and I just thought maybe, you know, if I came down here and laid it all out for you it might make a difference. - Shake hands with a brother, Lyle. (chuckles) (laughing) - Oh that smells so good Kenny. - Okay Brian. - Listen don't put Dad's on until he gets here, okay? He likes it rare. You fishies get out of that water, now I'm not gonna tell you again. You're not gonna be ready when Daddy gets here. (doorbell rings) Uh oh. He's here, come on! Here's your towel. Come on sugar. He's probably waiting. - Hello! - Hi! - You changed the lock. - Yeah I had to, it was busted. - Thought maybe I was locked out. - Oh I was sure you did. I have a key, remind me to give it to you, okay? Oh Lyle. Oh that's so pretty, thank you. - How are you Joyce? - I'm fine. - Good to see you hon. - Wonderful to see you. - How are you, sweetheart? - Hi Dad. - Give us a kiss. Good to see you. Throckmorton, what do you got to say for yourself? Give us a kiss. Is this for me? - Yeah. - Where'd you get it? (laughing) It's good to be home. - Come on Dad, we're having a party! - Yeah? - A barbecue. - Well say wouldn't it be better if we ate inside? - Oh I thought it would be nice out here. - Well you know it's my first visit home in two months, I just thought it'd be better if we ate indoors. - Okay well we can finish cooking out here and we'll eat inside. - Okay. - I wanna eat outside. - How are you, son? - Hi Dad. - You need a hand? - No, I got it. - Well look, we don't have to eat inside, I mean, if everyone wants to eat out here it's fine with me. - Oh no, it's nice and cozy in there. - Nah come on, I didn't mean to make a big deal out of it. We'll sit here. - Okay. - Mom said you got your job back. - Yeah how 'bout that? Signed up for a course in computer graphics too. - You did? - I thought you hated computers. - I do. I did. But you know sometimes you gotta make changes. Just like drinking. I knew for a long time I'd have to quit and finally I did. - Yes but you volunteered to take the computer course and you didn't exactly volunteer to quit drinking. - Yeah but I quit, didn't I? - Yes, but I think we all had a lot to do with that. - Well you didn't quit for me, did you? - We didn't quit for him, Mom. - No. - Let's just drop it, okay? I mean he quit drinking, that's what counts. Right? Here you go. - Get in here. We thank you dear lord-- - Dear God, we thank, oh. Sorry love. - Go ahead. - Okay. Dear God, we thank you for this food, and we thank you for the blessings of family. In Jesus's name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - There's a rare one on the end for you. - Thank you. Here you go, Throckmorton. Well, we're not exactly Barnum and Bailey, are we? - Well Mavis said it wasn't gonna be easy. - Hey look, let's not try and make everything Mavis says come true, okay? - I'm not. - Good, because Mavis isn't God, you know. - I know that. I know she's done this family a great deal of good. - Look, I'm not putting her down, but I'll bet if Mavis said my first visit home was gonna be the best time we've ever had, (bangs) this would be the best time we've ever had. - Having a good time is up to us, Lyle. - The first month is the worst. My dad was a monster for the first month. - Month? The first year is the worst. - I remember about two years ago my mom stopped drinking for a while and she started eating sugar and candy and soda and stuff like that and after a while her face kinda broke out with zits and pimples, really disgusting, you know? (laughing) - My dad keeps lecturing me on Jesus and God and AA, stuff like that. It's really a bummer. - It gets better though. I mean, when my dad was drinking he used to have blackouts. He wouldn't remember what he used to do. And he's been sober for three months and already he's starting to change. - Yeah but you don't have to live with him. - He's coming back next week. - Are you scared? - Yeah. - Brian. How do your horses feel about your dad moving home? - Great. - Yeah? Well do you think that they'll wanna come over here and be with us? - I dunno. - Try it, go ahead. See if they'll come. - Come on, come on you guys. Come on. Come on. (laughing) - You want a hand, Brian? - Yeah. - Which one should I pull? - You take Scotch, she's harder. - I prefer Soda. (laughing) Okay. There we go. Oh they're coming now. - Come on guys. - There we go. - They like you. - They do? - Yeah. Come on. Now you just drop the reins, it's okay. - Safe now? - Stay there, yeah. Can you be my horse too? - Yes. Climb up here, we'll go for a ride. Here we go, hop on. Hey, there we go. Hey! Hup hup hup what kind of horse am I? - Right, um... - You're a mustang! - You're a bronco! - I'm a thoroughbred, huh? - [Ken] We'll have you packed and out of here in a flash, Dad. - [Lyle] Hey the faster I get out of here, the better. - [Joyce] The faster you get home, the better. - Look at this, hon. 87 days, can you believe it? - Hey, keep that as a souvenir! - Good thought. - Burn it. - Better thought. Hey I heard you passed your driving test, is that true? - Yeah! - Who'd you bribe? - [Ken] My instructor. Hey Brian, come on, let's go! - Woo! - We're outta here! - [Lyle] Let's not leave anything behind. Check under the bed. - Already did. - Closet? - Brian's got it. - The bathroom? - Got that too. - [Lyle] Alright gang, come on, let's go, we're outta here. Let's go, let's go, let's go! - [Ken] Woo, we're outta here! - [Lyle] Hey, look at that sign. - [Brian] Welcome home, Dad. - [Joyce] We've got a surprise for you. - [Lyle] What kind of surprise? - [Lesley] You'll see. I've been cooking for three hours. - [Joyce] That's good, Kenny! - Your driving is terrific, son, but your parking leaves something to be desired. Alright gang, home at last. Let me give you a hand, son. That's alright, I got it, I got it, there we go. You take those. - Thank you. - I'll take Mother. - We're all spilling out of the van. (glass shatters) - Hey, where'd that come from? - From your stuff. - Oh come on, it's not what you think. I'm telling you it's not what you think. That dumb thing was sitting around for so long I forgot it was even there. - Brian. Give that to me. - Hey, come on. - Don't touch it. - I didn't even open it, look. Don't let this spoil the whole day. - Bottle was already open. - Alright, I had one little drink the night I moved in but that's it. For the past three months I haven't touched a drop. You don't believe me, do you? - I believe you, Dad. - Thank you. - Lyle, the bottle was almost empty. - Alright. So I had a bottle, one bottle! What difference does it make? I've been living alone in a stinking motel for the last three months! I don't think one bottle is doing too badly, do you? - Yes I do. - You don't have any idea what I've been going through, have you? - I know what we've all been going through and I don't wanna go through it anymore. - What's that supposed to mean? - It just means you're not ready yet, Lyle. - Oh, after all I've been through I'm not ready yet! (laughs) I'm not ready yet! - Dad, come back here, we believe you. (crashing) - No thank you, I'm not ready yet! - What if it's the truth? What if he hasn't been drinking? How do you think he feels being called a liar after all he's been through? - He was lying! - Well how are you gonna feel if he starts drinking again? Or if he gets in an accident and he kills himself? Then how are you gonna feel? ♪ There's little Tom Tucker ♪ ♪ Who cried when his head ♪ ♪ That curled like a lamb's back ♪ ♪ Was shaved so I said hush Tom ♪ ♪ Nevermind it ♪ ♪ For when your head's bare ♪ ♪ You know that the soot ♪ ♪ Cannot spoil your white hair ♪ - I'm sorry I dropped the bottle. - Oh Brian, I'm not. I'm glad you dropped it. Because now we know the truth. - Do you think, do you think he's mad at me at all? - I don't think he's mad at you at all. - How did he catch alcoholism? (sighs) - I don't know. - Do you think it was my fault? - No, I know it wasn't your fault. And I know he loves you very much. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? - Was that him? - I don't know. (sirens wailing) - No, let's make it a pint. Yeah, that's good. No no, wait a second. Make it a half pint please. No no no, wait. I'll just try one of these. No no, make this two of these. No no, just a half pint, that'll be fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, just a half pint please. How much is it? (doorbell rings) (tense music) (doorbell rings) - Does he have a key? - I gave him one. - Maybe he lost it. - Morning. - Morning. - I made about seven trips to the liquor store. And I called Mavis in the middle of the night and she said maybe the best way I could say I'm sorry is if I gave you these. (bottles clinking) I didn't open any of them. I've never asked the kids to skip school before but Mavis wanted to know if we could all come down there and see her in about an hour. - Okay. You come on inside and we'll get dressed. - I'm not ready. (voice breaking) - Okay well we'll be right out. - I'll be here. (crying) (solemn music) (upbeat music) (MultiCom Jingle)
