- Hey, Moe, it's me. It's me! Izzy! - Never heard of you! - Is this any way to treat a friendship of a lifetime? - What friendship? - I guess you're still sore because I tried to buy that bird act. - I'm not sore about you trying to buy a bird act! I'm sore I let you borrow money from me to buy a bird act! - It would've been a beautiful act, Moe! All we had to do was stand on the stage and watch the pigeons waves flags and ride bicycles. - So what the hell happened? - Well, the guy that was selling me the act left town. He took the birds, he took the flags and the bicycles. - Are you here with fancy batter, Izz, or with my dough? - What kind of a pal do you think I am, Moe? Maybe I didn't come with the cash but I came with the next best thing. I was reading the police gazette and I think I found us a job. - What kind of job? - Prohibition agents. - Feds! Who the hell do you think tore up my bar last night? - Moe, in times like these, you gotta let bygones be bygones. I promise not to hold it against them if you don't. Come on, what do you say? How about it? How about some of that old fashion trust? - How's that for old fashion trust?! - Well, I guess, Moe, you need a little more time to consider my offer. C'est la guerre. - Prohibition is her, Mr. E. - Prohibition is against booze, not cigars. - Only a matter of time. - Oh. Just exactly where are you gonna put that cigar? - Not exactly where I'd like to, Mr. E. Not exactly where I'd like to. - I was very fond of that cigar! - Look at you. You oughta be ashamed of yourself. You, with that silly mustache, fake carnation in your button hole, wearing your wardrobe from your old Vaudeville act. You look like you own the Waldorf Astoria but you're still two inches away from being a bum. - When you're looking for a job, Mrs. P, neatness counts. - I don't care what Grandma says, I don't think you're a bum. - Well, I'm not really. I applied for the job but it was already taken. - Maybe you should apply for the job again. - I have something brand new on tap, princess. - Daddy, you always have something new on tap. Last night I was out with a dentist and he asked me what you do for a living and I said nothing. I said nothing for two whole hours and he had a brand new Secondhand Roadster. - Come on, Paula, leave Daddy alone. - Give him a chance. - Well, thank you, gorgeous ladies. - Daddy, when are you gonna get a job? - Izzy, dear, I'm a little bit interested in the answer to that one myself. - Yeah, go ahead, say you're gonna get a job. - Well, Izzy? - Surprise us. - Vira, I promise, today I get a job. - Mr. E, the day you make something of your life, I'll light your cigar in Macy's window. - All right, later. Selma, how many people we got waiting out there? - No one else, Lieutenant, you're talking to the last applicant. - Damn it. I need more agents. They expect me to do the job with eight lousy agents. Look, old timer, now this is gonna be one tough occupation. So do you mind if I'm brutally honest? Why the hell do you want the job? - This is America, Lieutenant, and I'm proud to be an American. I came to this country when I was 10 years old. I left behind cruelty and injustice and arrived here on the shores of freedom and liberty. I've had a good life. I owe this country a debt I could never repay. But now, I'm going to try to repay it. - Okay, without all the hot comedy. - I'm dead broke. - Mm-hmm. Selma, anyone else show up yet? - What do you think you're offering? The maître d's job at the Waldorf? - Send McCoy in here. - Did you read my file on-- - Wait a minute, wait. You see, old-timer? This is what a Federal Agent looks like. Trim, tough, young. He has to be if he expects to tackle the goons we'll go after. - Excuse me, Lieutenant. But now it's my turn to be honest. McCoy, here, couldn't knock of a speak unless it was on the front cover of vogue. No offense, McCoy. I know I don't look the type but that's exactly what'll make me a great agent. I can go where the people are. I speak a little Polish, a little German, a little Italian. I even tried my hand at acting once and to top everything off, I happen to be a little chubby and for some reason or another, nobody ever suspects a chubby guy. I'll get the job done, Lieutenant. I'll be knocking off rum runners and breweries while McCoy, here, is still getting speak doors slammed in his fancy face. - Hey! - No offense. - Lieutenant! - Come on. We'll talk. - I'm telling you. - Let me manage this whole thing. I'm warning you, old-timer, this could be a dangerous job. - The job pays 40 bucks a weeks, regular. I got four kids that like to eat. I'm doing it for my kids, Lieutenant. How're they gonna get married if their old man doesn't have a job? - Selma? - Sorry, Lieutenant, there's no one out here but us chickens. - Okay, Isidor. You're hired. - You can call me Izzy. - Congratulations, Izzy, and shut off your intercom, Lieutenant, you left it on again. - I hate this assignment. I mean, do you know what it's like to enforce a law that nobody wants? We can't do much until we find you a partner. I don't think any of these guys will wanna work with you. You're just too, well, let's face it, you're too, too... Different. You know anybody else who wants a job? - Lieutenant, I have just the guy. Hey, Moe, it's Izzy! Well, I guess you calmed down a little bit. Moe, I'm here with your money! - Where's my dough? - Do you mind if I take a load off first? - No, not at all. Where's my money? - I got your cash in the form of a job. - I don't want any part of any job that has anything to do with you. What kind of a job is it? - Prohibition agent. - You were serious yesterday. - Oh, Moe, let's face it, what have we done with our lives? Nothing. That crummy Vaudeville act we did, that was a lousy act and you know it. So what're we doing now? You're a two-bit fight promoter, and out of work bartender and me, ha. Most of my life I've gone from job to job trying to make ends meet. It's the end of the line, Moe. In my opinion, it's been a lousy trip. It's time for us to do something right, something good, while we still got time. - I don't see it, Izz. I've had it up to here with failure. It's played too big a role in my life. I guess I haven't been the same since... Since Merium died. I'm just looking for a nice quiet place to retire. - We can't do that, Moe. We've got responsibilities. This is America and I'm proud to be an American. I came to this country when I was 10 years old. I left behind cruelty and punishment and arrived here on the-- - Stop feeding me that speech, Izz. I'm the one guy in the world who won't eat it. - Well, I guess that's the end of my pitch. - Glad to hear it. - Moe, can we shake hands for old time sake? - I don't see why not. - Moe, you're under arrest. Don't you know it's against the law to drink? - Izz, you wouldn't do this to me, would you? I guess you would do this to me. - I have to, I'm in law enforcement. - All right, I'll give the lousy job one lousy month. - Pal of mine, welcome to the Bureau of Prohibition. - Now come on everybody, drink up! This is the best hooch I ever brought down this lot. Hey, Zach, when you're finished loading the booze, come on back and join the party! We still got a couple of bottles left for ourselves. What the hell is that? - Get your hands up! - What is this? What's going on? I take care of you cops. Who are you? - I'm a man who hates people who run booze in my territory. - You crazy? You're the cops, ain't ya? - We're not the cops, fat man. We're the competition. The name's Vanderhoff. Some people refer to me as "The Dutchman" and from here on in, all the booze running from the east coast belongs to me. Shoot him. - No, no, wait! - I've got 10 men and a limited budget. We're gonna try and get the job done. Our responsibility is to cover 11 hundred square miles of territory up and down the east coast. That's our turf and it also belongs to every hood with a yearn to be somebody. And this is one of them. "The Dutchman," alias John Vanderhoff. You've read the file on him? Believe me, he's worse than anything you've read. He knocked over Fat Harry Dawson on his yacht a week ago but no one's talking. Now you better remember the tools of Dutch's trade. The 45. The pineapple. And this week the bum took delivery of something new. This is a Tommy Gun. Some of you might have heard of it. The Thompson submachine gun? Fires 700 rounds a minute. Dutch took delivery of 10 of these on Monday. Unfortunately, the federal government has only authorized us the use of one. And who knows how long it'll be before we get more. All right, the hoods are better armed and hungry to prove it. We'll just have to be smarter. We go at three o'clock. - Pardon me, sir. Go where? - Oh, that's right, you new men haven't been informed. We're knocking over Dutch's private speak at Van Cortlandt Park. Izzy and Moe, you stay here and man the phones. - Hey, Lieutenant, we didn't sign on to sit at a desk. - I want you both for backup. You're too old to do anything else. - I'll drink to that. - The jury is still out on our age. - Okay, wiseguy. Meet me at the firing range in 20 minutes. Let's see what you can do. - We'd be delighted. - He'll be delighted! Izz, you're crazy. I like manning the phones. - Moe, I've known you for more than 25 years. You're a fraud, con and a crook the same as I am. And in every crook there's a Fed trying to get out. I'm going to help you get that Fed out if it's the last thing I do. - Izz, you're not well. You need help, you need a lot of help. - Well, old-timer, I guess this is your chance to show me up. You figure maybe you'll teach me a few things? - Come on, Dave, relax. - This is the guy I was telling you about. A lot of bark for an old dog with no bite. - Okay, Izzy, let's see what you can do. This is a pistol and this is a gun. - No fooling? - Not bad for an old dog with no bite. - Where did you learn to do that? - Moe and I did a sharpshooting act on Vaudeville. - Okay, Morris, let's see you do your stuff. - All right. - What's the matter, you don't like guns? - I love guns. The only trouble is I hate bullets. - You hate bullets? What did you do in the sharpshooting act? - I was the guy with an apple on my head. - Nothing, Dave. No booze, no still, nothing. - Sign out front says "Social History." They teach you Feds how to read? - Who the hell tipped you off, Dutch? - I don't know what you're talkin' about. If you and your boys are here to discuss politics at Tammany Hall, take a seat. But if you're here to discuss tips and ponies, go someplace else. That ain't my line. - I don't know who tipped you wise, Dutch, but I'll find out, you can count on that. You're too smart for your own good, Dutch. Someday you're gonna tumble and this badge is gonna be there when you do. Anybody see that? - I didn't see anything, Sergeant. - Are they gonna do anything to him? - He's got a sore belly, hasn't he? - Some raid. - Did I know that two-bit crumb would be here at three on the nose or did I know? Put a couple of guys on the door. Okay, everybody, party time, huh? Jake! Next time anyone touches me, somebody dies! Touch me, somebody dies! - What's come over you, Izz? What's this strange, new fascination you have with success? - I don't know. I can't explain it. I get up one morning and I decided I wanted to be a hero to my kids. - Well I don't have any kids so I can be a bum all I want. A bum without bullet holes. I'm gonna give this lousy job one more lousy week. - Well, here we are, now, keep out of sight. There's gotta be a way to get in there. - Why don't we just knock on the door? - If we do, they'll knock out our teeth. Now the Dutchman was tipped, right? - Yeah. - They know what the department was doing. Well they don't know what we're doing. Because I don't know what we're doing. - Why're we doing it? - Because McCoy struck out and I think we can do better. I just got an idea. Look at the park. - Wanna play baseball? We're too old to play baseball. We're too old to chase hoodlums. We're too old to do anything. - We're not too old to be coaches. Come on, pal, we're gonna win. - Now let me get this straight. You want nine of my men, you're gonna dress them in those baseball uniforms and you're gonna go where? - I can't tell you that, pal. Now what do you say? - Yeah? - What do you mean, yeah? Haven't you seen us guys out here working our tales off the last few days? - Our boys could use a little refreshment. We just beat Canazei. - I don't know you guys. You're all new to me. - Hey, Harvey, if this ape don't want my thirsty guys buying hooch and celebrating, we'll just go to the joint down the block. - Certainly. - Yeah. - All right, all right. Tough guys, huh? Come on in. - So when Henshaw snagged this long fly from Pocono, I thought I'd gone to Heaven. It was a thing of beauty, a thing of art. - Yeah. - Beer all around for the best nine men in the Bronx. Drink up! Everybody drink. - Hey, coach, sorry I missed the game. Sounds like a doozy. - All the best people were there. - I wasn't. - Oh. Maybe you're not the big time you think you are. - Oh no? You know who I am? They call me "The Dutchman." - Oh. Well, do you know who I am, Dutchman? I'm the law. - You get your hands off me. - You're right, it's getting slimy. I'm Izzy and that's Moe. We work for the government and you're under arrest. - Sorry, folks, the joint has just been raided. ♪ Who's sorry now ♪ Who's having fun ♪ Stay where you are ♪ And I will take your gun ♪ You're sad and blue ♪ Look thirsty too ♪ But I think what I do is fun - You two actually nailed the Dutchman. It's incredible. The suits and ties will have him out in 10 minutes but it doesn't matter, you nailed him. - And we proved we can do it. - What do you want, a cigar? - We want to work alone. We want to find our own cases and make our own raids. What do you say, Lieutenant? - Looks like I just got myself two Feds who work freelance. - We did it, Izz! We really did it! - Not bad, Mister Gallagher. - Pretty damn good, Mister Shean! - You've joined the Navy! My prayers have been answered. - You'll have to pray a little louder. This happens to be a disguise that Moe and me are putting on to knock off a speakeasy. - Vira, I told you not to marry a man who puts mayonnaise on his pastrami! - It's delicious. - You sure the information is solid, Izz? - The guy said this was the joint. It looks like he was right. Got your gun? - Yeah. Forgot the bullets. Hey, what do I need a gun for? You said this raid wasn't gonna be dangerous. - You are beautiful. - Yeah? - We understand a couple of old sailors can get a drink here. - Gotta know the password. - Morris? Morris, are you all right? It looks like he's gonna pass out. He might be having a heart attack. Is there someplace where he could rest for a minute? - Yeah, go ahead, bring him inside here. - Go right in. - Thank you. - Oh, you look terrible. All right. Take it easy now. Take it easy. There you are. That's it. That's it. - Hey, buddy, give him a chair! - Are you all right, Morris? Have you got some spirits? I think an alcoholic beverage would be a great help for my friend. - You boys look a little old. Where'd you get those ribbons? - Have you forgotten the Battle of? Did you participate in the war to end all wars? Well we did. - Remember the Maine? - Of course I do. - Well he doesn't have to. He was on it! Now what about that whiskey? - Yeah, sure. Come on. - Here you are, Morris. - Excellent quality. - You know, you've been so kind to us, it breaks my heart to do this to you. - Do what? - Sorry, folks, we've got some bad news for you. - You've been knocked off by Izzy and Moe. - You can't do that, we pay our bills. We bought our protection. - I don't care who you bought protection from. You didn't buy it from us. ♪ Don't mess with us or you'll wind up in the old jail ♪ - You got a fat purse on you. - Nothing. Two-bit bum making bathtub water. That's all we come up with? That's all we come up with after two whole days? - Not that we didn't find him, Lieutenant, but every time we hit one of Dutch's places, they were ready. I think he's got a pipeline. - Ah! - Pipeline, we're on his damn mailing list. Why don't we just call the Dutchman and ask him to do the raid? - Anyone get lucky? What about all the booze he's dumping near the docks? - We tried, sir, but nothing. - Ma'am. - Izzy and Moe said they had a lead. - The day those clowns come up-- - Would you forget the rivalry?! - All right. - You people better get your butts moving. I want some results and I want it now. I'm tired of sitting ringside while Dutch runs the show. - Good afternoon, Admiral. If you'll come up to the poop deck, we have some bodies for the brig. - May I present our catch of the day? - While we're inside, shine the hood. - Yes, sir. - Boy. - Hi, y'all, it's Dallas. Don't waste your time applauding for me. I'm not sticking around up here. I'm going down there where the fun is. I heard a rumor that there's hooch in the joint. Now, listen, first, I hope that you'll be kind to a few of my pals from Dallas' place, the Barry Sisters. ♪ Oh ♪ Do it again ♪ I may say no, no, no, no, no ♪ But do it again - Isn't she something? - Who? - Her. Dallas Carter. I read all about her in the newspapers but this is the first time I've seen her up close. - Big deal. We got work to do. - No, Izz, if you look real close, you'll see something of Merium in her eyes. - You really think so? - Yeah, I'm sure of it. - Merium's been gone a long time, Pal. - Izz, Merium may be dead but her memory isn't. Not by a long shot. ♪ I may say no, no, no, no, no ♪ But do it again ♪ My lips just ache to have you take ♪ ♪ The kiss that's ready for you ♪ ♪ You know what to do ♪ You won't regret it - Wait until you see the bar they have inside.

Well, what would you ladies like to drink? - Isn't that a pretty setting, Izz? Doesn't it make you feel sad to spoil all their fun? - Terrible, just terrible. All right, folks, I've got bad news. You've just been raided by Izzy and Moe. ♪ Sorry now ♪ Sorry now, just give me your booze ♪ ♪ And all of you lose ♪ The chance to get drunk ♪ I know I'm a skunk - Party-pooper. - This is America, lady, and I'm proud to be an American. - And he came to this country when he was 10 years old. - I'm going to ask you one question, who owns this joint? - The Distract Attorney of the city of New York. You actually arrested the New York DA? Nobody arrests the New York DA! - He broke the law. - The DA doesn't break the law. He is the law! Everyone knew about the bar in his place. But no one dared do anything about it. Not until you clowns came along. - Please, Lieutenant, don't thank us. We were just doing our job. - Get them out of my sight. - But, sir, they really were acting according to procedure. - All three of you get out of my sight! - Look, Lieutenant-- - And don't you try any double talk! You boys are finished, you're out! You've got your walking papers, disappear! I knew it was a mistake to give two old geezers a job. Damn. I was much happier back in Burrow Hall. - Can I say something? - Yes! Goodbye, ta-ta, farewell, or too-da-loo! But nothing else, not another syllable! What the hell is that?! - I think it's our fan club. - Yes?! Yes, sir. Hold on you two. Yes, yes? Yes. Yes. Right away. They're here right now. Yes, sir. That was the mayor. He wants you to know that he applauds your integrity. It's incredible. You two will probably end up with some kind of medal. Don't you have anything to say? - Yeah. Goodbye. - Farewell. - Ta-ta. - And too-da-loo. - This is America, my friends, and I'm proud to be an American! I came to this country when I was 10 years old! I left behind... - Guess what, Vira! Mr. E thinks he's Douglas Fairbanks. - Ain't she beautiful, Izz? Like I said, there's a lot of Merium in her eyes. Don't you think? You know, I get very tired of being alone, Izz. Different with you. You go home to family every day you're through. I go home to nothing. Nothing at all. - Merium has been dead for 12 years. He should've gotten over it by now. He wants to take Dallas out on a date with him. Some case. A prohibition agent can't be seen with Dallas Carter. - You know what? Why don't we invite them over here for dinner? - The day that your mother invites Dallas Carter for dinner, I will light her cigar in Macy's window. Don't worry about my mother. I'll take care of Mom. The things is, we'll invite them over for a good home cooked meal. - I can't wait to see your mother with Dallas Carter. You know, you're very pretty? - What? Go on. - No, I mean it. You're beautiful. And very sexy. - Now I know you're crazy. - Even when you can undress without showing anything. - How is that sexy? - It's provocative. - Oh, Izzy. That's a very nice thing to say. - I love you more now than I did when I married you. - Thank you. I love you too. And I'm very, very proud of you, Izzy. Oh, how hard you've been working and all the things you've been trying to do for the girls. I wish I could say that when the light was on. I don't know how. - Just as long as you love me. - Are you coming to bed? - Wild horses and the Chinese army couldn't stop me. - Hi, y'all. It's Dallas. I hope you're all Butter and Egg Man out there because I want the cash to flow like wine, if I had any wine. Now you can't get booze in my place, you can't buy booze, because I sell water. Only water. Scotch water, rye water, even bourbon water. Now enjoy yourselves. Enjoy the music and get off your keisters and dance. I want you all getting thirsty as bears so you can buy my water. Take it from me, it's the healthiest drink in town. Keep your eyes open, I can smell a couple of Feds in the crowd but I can't spot 'em. - Sure thing, Dallas. - Hey, who are you guys? I don't remember hiring you. - That's because you didn't. We joined the firm tonight. - Don't I know you from somewhere? - I'm Izzy. - And I'm Moe. We're the couple of Feds in the crowd. - Now just wait a little minute now. Aren't you the guys that put the arm on the DA? - Mm-hmm. - We are. Now we're gonna put the arm on you. - Mind if I change the outfit and comb my mouthpiece? - Why, sure, as long as we go along with you. - Swell, I hate to undress alone. You realize this will get you guys in more trouble than it will me. - We'll take our chances. - Besides being well built, I'm damn well connected. - Well as far as I know, running a speak is still illegal, even when you're well connected. You break the law, you gotta pay. - Tough guy, huh? Do that again. - Do what again? - The way your ears go back when you get mean. - I don't get mean. - Sure you do, you're mean now. - This isn't mean, this is determined. Mean comes later. - Is that a promise or just an active encouragement? - I thought you were gonna call your lawyer. - In a minute. Can I offer you boys a drink? This is good stuff, the genuine article. Just like you. - Gotta watch out for Izz. He's a married man. - What about you? - Hmmm, you gotta watch out for Moe too. You fool around with him, he's liable to get a heart attack. ♪ Some others I've seen ♪ Might never be mean ♪ Might never be cross ♪ Or try to be boss ♪ But they wouldn't do - Yeah. Of course. I understand. Perfectly, yeah. See you in 10 minutes, Tom. Yeah, when they book me. I've got bad news for you boys. It's like my Dallas, Texas daddy used to say. "This is gonna hurt you more then it's gonna hurt me." Oh, give me a call when the Bureau stops chewing you out. - Why should they chew us out? - That's what I like, a man of vision. - Dallas Carter? Are you guys nuts?! - She was breaking the law. - I don't care if she broke your skulls. That's Dallas Carter. - Seems to me you're getting hotter about her than you did about the DA. - She's got better connections than the DA. I don't like you guys. At first I didn't mind the way you operated but now you're making a laughing stock of the Bureau and you can't do that! Illegal booze is a serious business. - Serious jobs can be done with a little style and humor. - Well I don't like your style and a I despise your humor. You're not in Vaudeville anymore. What I want for the future is dignity and decorum. You can't shoot from the hip without talking to me first. - Yes, sir. - From here on, you'll take orders from me. And your days of operating freelance are over. Now is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Now here's a job you'll do by the book. The Dutchman has a big booze operation going on in Saratoga. It's run by the local sheriff. Her runs everything up there. He's the town mayor, Justice of the Peace, even pumps gasoline. Get up there and break him but do it my way. Remember-- - Yeah, yeah, we know. Dignity and decorum. - Decorum and dignity. - Yes, sir, may I help you? - Yeah, we're Mr. and Mrs. Benson. We have a reservation. - Oh. The bridal suite? An anniversary celebration. - Yes. On top of that, we'd like to take our marriage vows again. - Oh, how nice. - We understand that your sheriff is also the Justice of the Peace. - Oh, yes indeedy. If you'd like, I can call him. - Oh, that would be lovely. What a charming little hotel you have here. - Jenny, get me the sheriff. - Hey, buddy, can I get a drink? That is a very ugly woman. But she's very, very rich and I need all the painkiller I can get. - Hello? - Did he buy the disguise? - Of course he did. You're a very lovely woman. - Thank... Thank you. A matter of fact, I feel like I'm cheating on Vira. - Everything seems to be taken care of. He'd be delighted to perform the ceremony. He said to come right over. - Real pleasure, Ben. You too, Mildred. Sit down, sit down. - Comfy, comfy. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Well now. You two planning on staying in town for long? - Long enough to do a little lovin'. - Well, then let's get on with the ceremony. - Why not? - Well, go ahead. - That'll be $10. Ben Benson, do you take this woman, Mildred, to be your lawful wedded wife? - I certainly do. - And do you, Mildred Peterson, take this man, Ben, to be your lawful wedded husband? - I most certainly do. - Then by the power vested in me in the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Don't be shy, you two. - That was lovely. - Say, do you think we could get a little drink or something to sorta celebrate? - I think I could rustle up something. - That would be lovely. Thank you. Oh. - Say, that's great. - Blissfully smooth. - You know, we have nothing like this back home. Do you think it possible that we could get a little of this to take back with us? - Oh, that's possible. How much do you want? - Well, one or two-- - Possible three cases. - Here it is, folks. - Well, that's a pretty sight. But I've got bad news. I'm Izzy. - And I'm Moe. - I wanna thank you all for inviting me to share your dinner table. It's been a long time since I've had a home cooked meal. - I'm sure you've never had a home cooked meal like this one. - Momma, please. - I'm doing my best, V. - Hey, that looks like wonderful kneidlach. Oh, and look at that luxion kugel and that kishka. Mmmm, it is a wonderful dinner, Mrs. P. By the way, have you ever tried making matzo balls with seltzer instead of water? Arnie Rothstein tells me tells me it's the only way to make them fluffy. - Matzo ball and seltzer? - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - I just think this looks so divine. - Um... Seltzer instead of water. - Absolutely, Vira, it works like a charm. At least, that's what Arnie says. - Arnie? Arnie said that? - What're you guys made up for today? - Oh, the plumber brothers knocked off another joint. - Izzy, Moe, it's for you! - Izzy, here. The Dutchman is bringing in one hundred cases of Cuban rum. He's got it disguised as farm equipment. - You consider this source reliable? - Oh, yes sir. But we're gonna need a couple extra guys on a job like this. - All right. Take Harris and McCoy. - Ugh. - And be careful. - Oh, don't worry about that. - You better be right about this. - You never did trust us, did you, McCoy? - I never trusted you and I never liked you. Let's go. - Its okay, Izz, you just tell me what you want done. I always trusted you. - You stick with Prince Charming. I'll stay with Moe. - Excuse me. - This time your gun is loaded. - How do you know? - I loaded it. - Did you? I can't do this much more, Izz. I talked to Dallas last night. She wants me to quit. - If you don't pay attention, you're not gonna be alive to quit. - Greetings from the Dutchman! - Damn it, I'm hit! - Are you all right? - That's my blood, isn't it? I got hit. - You'll need a doctor. - I don't need a doctor, forget the doctor. I got to look for a different line of work. Something with a future. - You can't quit now. - What do you mean I can't quit? Somebody just put a hole in me, didn't they? Worse than that, they put a hole in my suit. First time in my life I spent more than $29 on a suit. - You spent $29 for that suit? - Yes. - Not only have you been shot but you've been robbed. - We gotta get a doctor! Harris is hurt real bad. I don't think he's gonna make it. - Just my luck, Doc. I buy a suit with two pair of pants and I end up getting shot in the arm. - How are you, pal? - I'm all right. - How's he doing, Doc? - He'll be fine. - How's Harris? - Still operating. Can you identify the shooters? - It all happened too fast. I'm sure it was the Dutchman but I got no way to prove it. But if we start talking-- - You do the talking, Izz. I quit. I told you, I'm out. - Are you nuts? The Dutchman wasn't after Harris, he was after us! - Izz, we're too old to take any bayonet charges. Our arteries can't take it anymore. We gotta start acting our age. - Moe's right. I don't want any dumb heroics. Leave the Dutchman to me. - He's all yours. I resign, Lieutenant. - I understand you decision, Moe. Now just take it easy. I'm gonna go check on Harris. Moe was slightly wounded and Agent Harris is still in surgery. - And Izzy? - He's all right. Your story tonight is Moe. He's decided to leave the service. - There's Moe! - There he is! There he is! - One at a time! - Is it true? - Yes, it's true, I quit. - You're leaving the bureau? Is it because of Harris? - Officer Harris is a very brave young man. I can only hope and pray that he's gonna be all right. - Haven't you heard? Harris just died on the operating table. - What? - You have no comment? Then you are quitting because of Harris. Another agent killed because of a dumb law nobody wants. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't get on a soap box with me, mister! A good man died today. He died fighting hoods and mobsters who were getting fat and rich off of illegal hooch, the same hooch you people drink everyday out of silver hip flasks. Look, this is America. I'm proud to be an American. I came here when I was 10 years old. I left cruelty and injustice and I arrived on the shores of freedom and justice. I've had a good life and I owe this country and debt that can never be repaid. Only now I'd like to repay it. Only a few people and Dutch will stand in our way. - Don't ask me to do that, Moe. - Why not? There's talk around town that the Dutchman's getting a special shipment. Canadian gold. 25 year old bonded whiskey, the genuine article. - We want it, Dallas. It's 300 cases. 12 bottles to a case. A hundred dollars a bottle. That's 360 thousand dollars. If we knock that shipment off, we can hurt the Dutchman bad. Real bad with his high class clients. - You'll hurt me too. Some of that shipment is headed my way. Want to stop my Butter and Egg Man from having a good time. - We just want to stop the Dutchman from killing people. - I wouldn't be anywhere without prohibition. I gotta make the most of it while it lasts. - Oh, Vira sent this. - What is it? - It's her recipe for luxion kugel. - Get the hell out of here. I hate luxion kugel. - Well, she thought you might want it. - It's important to me, Dallas. He's gotta be stopped. A good man died yesterday, that can't happen again. - Tough guy, huh? Well Dutch is tougher. - Maybe. I've been around a lot longer. Maybe I'll just have to outlast him. - Wait! Tonight at midnight, I hear they're loading at 23rd and the River. - Well. - Well, well. The catch and jail 'em kids. Heard you had a little trouble the other day. Ain't it a shame you didn't die? - Let's get out of here, Moe. - Yeah. Before I kill somebody. - I'm driving, you're riding. - Everything all right, Joe? - Yeah, we got it all. - Now we got it all. Tell the Dutchman, "Greetings from Izzy and Moe." - We did it, Izz, we did it! Look out! They're gaining on us! - This thing won't go any faster! Start shooting! - I can't. - Why not? - I ain't got any bullets in my gun! - Here, try this. Might be a little strange. It has bullets in it! - My God, that's loud. - You're right, Moe. I oughta quit this job. - Not just yet, Izz! Not just yet! - That oughta lose 'em. I got an idea, Moe. - I hate your ideas. I wanna do a solo. - You mean you're breaking up the act? - I'm breaking up the act! - Okay! Watch this finale! - They stole my booze! 360 grand worth, the best hooch to come from Canada! Who tipped 'em, Jake?! Who talked to the clowns and tipped them wise?! I want answers tonight! Or I want blood! Where's the booze now? - Warehouse on Fulton Street. - Those two clowns, they did good work. - They're all right. - Selma, how about some coffee? - It's almost three o'clock in the morning. Selma finally left an hour ago. I never really trusted those guys. I didn't wanna be wrong. Guess I was. - Lieutenant Murphy. Hold on. Shut the door behind you, will you, McCoy? It's the wife. Get back to Holland, you reckless maniac. What the hell are you doing calling me like this? - I wanna know what I paid for! Why wasn't I told those two were going after my booze? - Because I didn't know, they acted alone. - That hooch cost me over 300 thousand bucks! - Don't worry. It's in a warehouse on Fulton Street. We'll figure a way to get it out. - Did you figure who tipped them in the first place? - No. - Well I did. Jack saw those clowns in Dallas' club tonight and she knew when I was making delivery. I got hot news for you, Murph. This city is about to lose another saloon keeper. - You're playing too rough, Dutchman. That wasn't part of our deal. I didn't mind going after those to crumbs, but when you burned a kid like Harris or try to nail someone like Carter. - Yeah? - It's McCoy. I just found out that Murphy's on the Dutchman's payroll and the Dutchman knows Dallas told you two about the booze. - Where can I find you if I need you? - I'll be home in about five minutes. - Okay. Vira, call Moe, tell him I'm picking him up right away! - Telephone calls at three in the morning?! - It was an important call! - The day you do something important, I'll light your cigar in Macy's window! ♪ Every morning, every evening ♪ Ain't we got fun ♪ Not much money, oh but honey ♪ Ain't we got fun ♪ The rent's unpaid, dear ♪ We haven't a car ♪ But anyway, dear ♪ We'll stay as we are ♪ Even if we owe the grocer ♪ Don't we have fun - Dallas? Dallas? - Hey, Ben, did you see Dallas? - A couple guys came by about half hour ago. Took her outside to talk. I haven't seen her since. - We gotta go after her, Izz. We gotta do something! - Don't worry, Moe, we're going after her. And this time we're gonna get the Dutchman. - Murphy on the take, I can't believe it! - Are you gonna slow down or do you want me to drive? - I've had enough of your reckless driving, you can try mine for awhile! I hope he doesn't do anything to Dallas. - We'll get there in time. We'll show him the booze and then he'll negotiate. - I just hope we get there on time. - You wanna know what's gonna happen to those old-timers when this is all over? - Not particularly. Thanks to you, they just stole a truckload of booze. As far as the public's concerned, the dry guys are crooks. Whatever they'll get, they'll deserve. - Dutch, they just called from the front gate! The truck's arrived. - Well get down there! I want every gun in the joint on 'em. - I'll be going now. I don't wanna be here when you transact business. - Afraid to get your hands dirty? - It's a little to late to worry about getting my hands dirty. - All right, Dutchman, where are you?! - Right here, you clowns. - We brought your booze. We're ready to negotiate. - Yeah. I'll negotiate. - Drop it, Dutch! - You're right, Moe. - About what? - We are too old for this. - Too old, my eye! Wait. Where's Izzy? - Maybe he got hit. Come on, let's go. - I gotta find Dallas. - Keep your hands in the air! - All right. - You look for the Dutchman. I'll look for Dallas. - Is this what you're looking for? Get out of my way or she's dead! - Moe, be careful, stay away! - Don't hurt her, Dutch. - Put your gun down, old man, and back away! Drop it or she's dead! Please don't hurt her, Dutch. Just tell me what you want. You can trust me. - What do I want? That's easy, old man. Come here! I want you to die. Get on your knees! - Don't shoot him, Dutchman! - Back off! Nobody move a gun or the old man is dead! I said, back off! - Who did that? - Who did that? Boy, are you lucky! - Heavy weapon. - How could you take a chance with a shot like that? - I just imagined he had an apple on your head. Well, I guess this is it. We caught the villain, you got the girl. There's only one thing left. - What's that?
