That's great. That's magic. Teach me. Girls will like this trick. No. That's a secret. Show you a better one. Yes. It's to be better... you said so. Coin? Coin... Here. Got $1 coin? $1... Look. How did you do it? That's an even bigger secret. Boss! Boss... Are you nuts? You're all sick! Psychos! Back to the office. Let's go. Let me help you. No. You're the one who carry too much. Thanks. Will you go with the group? Yes. Sunday. Won't you stay longer? No. I'd like stay longer, though. Kong. The girl likes you. Respond... Why you...? Don't run... What's that? Nothing. That's nothing? Nothing. Please... Honey, I've been waiting. Sorry. I worked overtime. Doesn't matter. I love you. What? Do you know what time it is? So noisy. I wanna sleep. Take this. I hate Hong Kong people. So damned proud. Why live in such a shitty place if they're great? Are you good at Kung Fu? Not really... You're with the Kung Fu national team? Yes. Great. You're good at fighting? I'm not. You're leaving in 4 days. Where'll you go? I don't know. A few months before returning to the national team. If I can't find a job... then I'll go home. I have a buy-1 - get-1 - free dinner coupon. I wanted to go with Chuichi, but she only has time for her boyfriend. Will you go with me? Sure. After work tomorrow. Are you good with your lover? Nothing special. He looks like a playboy. He cares so much for me. What does he do? In restaurant Doing what? Waiter. Waiter? You come here for a waiter? There're plenty in Shenzhen. Is he serious? Ricky has no parents. He promised to marry me and have a family. He promised? I can promise you a million dollars. Just that I won't pay. Don't trust people easily. He won't. I just care about you. Alright. You really won't have hotpot with us? What hotpot? You don't like hotpot. Oh yes, I don't like it. Let's go. The beef is good. Thanks. Kong. You're good. Why don't you fight? They want you fight, right? That's illegal. $20,000 for winner. It's not stealing. If I were you, I'll do it. If I go, I'll not be kicked out of the national team. Nobody knows. No way. I wanna continue... to be the new Jet Li. Doesn't matter. Nobody knows. I can't. Cool. You'd keep your faith It's good. Bill please. Alright. Do you know Kwok Kwan? Kwok Kwan? He's my senior. He's now a clown at circus. I know. What a waste. He used to be good. After one fatal injury, he's never his old self... ...and becomes a clown. I think... One should plan carefully for oneself when young. No one cares if you die. I knew it since young. One must rely on himself and trust himself. If I have nothing to eat... will you be hungry? Thank you. $453. Sorry, you've present this coupon when you order. You can't use it now. What do you mean? $453, please. What the hell! It's cheating! Miss, it's written clearly on the coupon.

Don't pay! $400 is enough... I don't fear. I won't go. Please go. Go! Excuse me. Sorry. I just... lost my temper. Forget it. It's OK. What? That was not your fault. It's all her fault. As a man, I'm responsible... for it all. I couldn't take you to a better restaurants. Sorry. Don't say that! If you're poor, no one will respect you. If we were rich... we wouldn't have to act like beggars just then. We could go to a 5-star hotel. If I were a man, I must learn to fight, and make a lot of money. It's not that easy! You just don't e do it. Now it's too late. They left a name card with me. The gangsters... Let's take a look. Won't hurt. Surrender... Go. Don't fight anymore. You're old. You'll be killed. We gotta eat, Soo. One more? I'll show you a trick. What trick? Watch it carefully or you'll miss a lot. You're... We're looking for Mr. Ma. Wait a moment. Soo, someone's looking for boss.

How do you know? Just the way you squatted. Do you smoke? Seldom. That's good. I smoke often. You give me all. I don't smoke. Then why did you say seldom? Say no! Do you? No! Tough! I have mine. Learn to smoke. Then we can share. No. Try it. No. It's cool. No! Try it. No. You learn it. You're so annoying! I'll stop annoying you if you smoke, OK? Smoking is cool. Sleep anywhere.

How's the pool tonight? Not much. How much is not much? About $900K. How about the Mainland guy's match? $700,000. I got 4 or 5 million in Chelsea's match. And I got more than $10M... Few millions in profit. I know you're rich. You wanna make it big? How? Count on me. We'll get more than soccer. Ma, let's work together. You'll have 20%. You'll get much more. You think it's too little? It'll be $10M each match. Do you? Underground boxing can't be that big. I can do it. Think about it. Join me if you want. Let's eat. Great. Wanna come along, Captain. Your treat? Sure. Cool! Watch it. What would you have? Right! Noodles with pork, mushroom, hot dogs, fish, meat balls, knuckle, beans, wonton and stew. Add some spiced beef and shredded pork. That'll be served in 2 bowls. You're so right! How about you? Beef noodles... cola. I'll have the same. I'll have the same. Working hotels pay much better. It easy money for all of us. It's easy for you! That bastard forced to do it from behind. It's hell to get it done. It's still hurt. That's OK. Pass the tough ones to me. Ada will take anything. She's good. What? Wanna rob me blind? I'll kill you! Really? I'm so scared! I wanna pee. How could it be? It's OK. Do you receive your share? He keep it save for me. What? He paid for me living. He paid? It's yours, right? You've to end this. Must think how to dump this pimp. Choose a customer who cares about you. Treat him well. Make him love you and take you away. Is that possible? Yes! You're young and pretty. Find an old one and pretend to be pitiful. Every man wanna be a hero. We're human after all... But never take a regular guy. It's useless. Find a gangster or a policeman. One that can deal with your pimp. Hey! What'd you say? Nothing. Nothing. I'd not ask you! Did we meet before... Who're you? Hey, stop it! My bro is Johnny the triad boss! Let go! Run! Their people are coming! Let go! Be cool... We're the world... Not right... Chuichi had it coming, she asked for it... Let her be. Won't happen next time. We are the children...? no. Same race...? What're you mumbling about? None of your business. We are all ass...? Classmates? Can't be right... We're gangbang gang? Not even... Kill! Run! Why posing? Let's go! Should be fine now. You excel in martial arts? No, I don't. But you handled them with Tai Chi. Just messing about. Messing about? You beat them easily! I'm streetwise. He is a Kung Fu Master. No way! He is disgusting... I remember... you owed me $100. We're blood brothers! My brain power is back! Jet, Mr. Sun's here. Tell the boss. Hey gal... gal! Don't scare the customers. Something wrong, I'll get the guns. Fai... What's this all about? Chansun, why are you here? Your old man runs gambling house. You compete with me in soccer gambling... and now in underground boxing? You want war? Stay calm. It's a free world. Apparently. But you got my customers! They come at will. You're bastard. Let's fight! Cheap boxers. Great boxers, you have? Not much... Challenge? I've no fear, Chansun! Side bet? Sure. How much? Just $2M. 6 zeros. Good. You, one more match. Wait. You gain so much. $20K isn't enough! $100K. Wait. You earn it. $100K, for winner. Fight! Alright! Your fighter isn't any good. Is there another one? Another one? It'll benefit you only. Fight another time. We set our own pools. Sure. That's fair. Wanna try a new format? What? 3 on 3. Street Fighters rule. Street Fighters? Scared? I don't have many fighters. I sure count on it. Scared? Small game, $10M. Fine. Deal. 3 days later I'll collect... then. With body bags! Your fighters' bodies. We'll see. $120K. Check it. Check it for me. OK. Are you confident? Yes! Boss, what is the prize? You must fight. $200K for each win. Nothing if you lose. Remind me to insure. Bastard! Over there, please. Welcome, please be seated. It's big! Thank you. Tasty. More... No. You've it. It's for you. You like it. I can have what I want? You said no one let you have the fish cheeks. I give it to you. You're so kind! You ordered too much. How can you finish all these? You ordered too much. How can you finish all these? Join us. Don't mind if I do. You fought well today. Thanks, mere luck. Don't choke. Will you finish this? The way you fought is rather silly. Why? I just know. Do you know what you're talking about? Buddy! What's up? Can I borrow the lid? Sure. Take it. Thanks. What then? Excuse me, but... what are you doing here? Begging. Not a soul around... and you beg here? None of your business. Just curious. It's my hobby. Make sure you return it. Go... Thanks. What now? Do you have one more? Yes... here. Take them all. Thanks so much. Wait. It's for you. No! It doesn't suit me. Give me back the lid. You'll play less. Hurry up. I'll use these lids... You ordered too much. How can you finish all these? You ordered too much. How can you finish all these? Join us. Don't mind if I do. Let see your punches. Come on. O.K... Cool! Your husband? I'm not married. You look like you're married. You know it all, you're just not mean enough. Again. Your opponent fight to kill while you're not. You fought like a showman, and you won it the hard way. That can't be right. Kung Fu is a form of exercise. Mind your own business! What's that? Return it! My friend is over there. I wanna greet her. Go. How are you lately? About the same. That Mr. Ma who comes with you is rich. Yes. He's me exclusively for a month. That idiot is waving at you. Smile realistically. How does he treat you? Good. It's a good chance. If he keeps you for a month, he must like you. How long will it last? Be initiative. Tell him nobody ever treated you so kind. You wanna be with him. Try your best in bed and tell him that doing so... because you have nothing better to offer. Say it pitifully. Say you never did the same with other clients. If it fails, try the next one. I've to go, or else the old man will get angry. Fai, aren't you scared? Why? Everyone bet on my side tonight. No. Many bets are on my side. There're morons who bet on yours? Are you collecting bets in a mad house? That's bullshit! I'm just telling the truth. Beat me if you can. I'll beat you square. Have you won? Not yet, but I won't lose. Kill him! Kill him! Are you all right? It's $600K here. Deposit in different banks. Got it? Be smart. Get some rest. Captain, take care him. Look. Any feeling? How about this? No. Gotta suck the blood out. Suck with mouth? Disgusting... He isn't dead, is he? No. Just hospitalize for 6 months. I acted like a mad guy. I didn't know what I was doing. I realized later that... I almost killed the guy. They cheat. Your kick was really fierce. And the punches was also great. This time? You really wanna hurt yourself? That hurt. Oh no! My shirt. Does it hurt? No. What? Nothing. No one has ever been this kind to me. Thanks. What now? Do I... have a chance? Can you... be my girlfriend? Fai. He's healed up. Can we win, yes? The opponent is the champion of K1. Powerful. Chansun pay dearly for him. Very expensive? $5M or more. Chansun must be mad! I've nothing to do with your $20M side bet. Fai. Let's talk. Chansun takes no bet. We've collected $19M against Kong. If Kong loses, we loose at least $10M. Bastard! Sun is so evil... $19M within 3 hours? Sorry, Fai. They betted separately in smaller amount. I couldn't stop it any earlier. What to do next? I've stopped all betting. Reopen. The opponent King, 1 .1 times; Kong, 3 times. All odds follow. See how much we get. Yes, Fai. Remember, 20% is yours. Kong, you must win. The prize will be $2M. Can I have $100K more? $100K? I know a master who can help me win. $100K... OK! What did they say? We'd been set up by Chansun. What? Chansun bet against Kong on our pool, but he collects no bet. Fai is forced to take higher risk. What then? It's an all-or-nothing match! Is there really a master? What master! He wanna take $100K more. You're much smarter now! What now? Who is the master? Tell me! Is there any? What? A loser! Prepare this match with me. $100K... Yours. Really? Are you serious? You're my man. I'm the best both in hitting or being hit. Kong, don't... Listen, for $100K... I can be your practice partner or your punch bag. Just say it and I'll do want you like. No. Run! Run! What're you doing? Helping you. No thanks. Sit here and watch. Everyone knows you look better than King. But that's not the issue. We gotta talk about your power. His kicks and knees are powerful. And his boxing is also great. In the match... he'll attack your upper and lower parts. You're now free to demonstrate... your best moves. That's set menu. Got daily special? Sure! This is... Wong Faihung Stop! Didn't you wanna help? Sure. How? Take this. What for? Hit him when I say so. Hit where? Anywhere, and be hard and fast. And watch out for me. OK. Come on. Hit! Soothe with your hands. This stick's for beating. Hit harder, OK? Hit! Let me show you. Be still and ass up. I'll show you a good swing. Again... Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! How ruthless? Come on. Hit him. Harder! Right! Harder! That's it! Direct hit? Let's continue. Continue? who said so? I'm the one who say when... when! Tin... Are you OK? Direct hit... also? Keep on. Come on. Sure. Fight like this... You hit me on purpose? Stay away. Hit him. Swing hard! Drop your weapon. Drop it. You worked hard. Sit down. She's mean. By the way, don't stop in actual fighting. You must keep on even if your opponent falls. It's either you or him. Understand? Continue! Slut. You... Ready. Tin. Are you worried? A bit. Wish Kong will win. I'm Mr. Ma's mistress. How nice. But I don't like it. He doesn't pay? Money is not that important. So noble! Old man likes fresh young girls. Don't worry. He'll be bored soon. Then you'll be able to go. You don't feel good? No. But I have to tell you. It's your fortune having such a man. What else do you want? Idiot! Go find another waiter. Don't you know better? Nobody cares if you live or not. You should make the most when you can. Find your "Mister Right"? Then wait to be dumped? Streetwalking while you're old? It can't be! Wake up. With men... deceiving each other... is the name of the game. Thank you, I'm forever in your debt. How's your childhood? Poor... farmers. And you? My father's a gambler. Vented his anger on me whenever he lost. Got a hooker if he had money. If he's penniless... That's really hurt. Tears? They're useless. My mother held me and begged for mercy every time. He never stopped. I never blame mother. She got no money. I'll not let myself to be just like her. Do you understand? Great! What now? Must be sent to E.R. right now. Go out. He's dead. Why're you here? It's warm. That's OK. Really? Thanks. You've stayed here for long, but I didn't notice. I know what you mean. I feel the same. Maybe... it's instinct. You won't beware of the one you trust. They say HK's Tsing Tao beer's better... Bullshit! I'm not sure. Why didn't you fight? I'm stupid. My mom taught me kung fu. I have no dad. Everyone in my village knows kung fu. Grandma, grandpa... everyone. But nobody makes a living with it. They all farm. Mom said those without authority... if known to be competent... they will be used and manipulated. At the end, those without authority will be the losers. If not for their skin... they wouldn't have been hunted. Tigers were killed for their skin. My teacher used to tell me. Goats were killed for their horns. Seals were killed for their dicks. For me? Come on... It's expensive. So you have another jacket. Where's the invoice? What? It's here. Get it refunded if you like. By the way, why are you so thrifty? I'm saving money. To get marry? No. I wanna save $300K for my mother's new dim-sum shop. With this, I have $130K now. My mom is a poor lady. Her boss uses her ruthlessly. A little money for endless work. To be frank, my mom's dim-sum is great. It must be great. You mean you wanna try it? If you come to my village, my treat. Sure. It's finished? Let's get some cold ones. Your treat? Sure. Thanks, Mr. Handsome. Wait. I'll put the money here. Now Kong beat the K1 champion. Can we set him up against an army next? Young gangster fought off 10 men This boy is from Kim-Wah Gang. Both the triads and the cops know. Good selling point. I've made up a name for him. Portland Street Fighter! Everything is just the way you said. All bets are on Kong Ko. More than $10M. Do your job. Wai! You, come in. You must lose tonight. All bet on you, we're in trouble if you win. If you lose, we'll give you $1 M. I won't fake a loss. If you don't lose, we'll lose a lot. I'd rather not fight. That's not an option! I'll not fight! Where's your girl? Call her. Call her. Hello? Hello? Who are you? Kong... is that you? Tin! Don't mind me. I'm OK... You don't have to die, just to lose a match. $1 M, easy money. It's OK with you, right? But you can't just lose, you've to make everyone believe it. Fight! Who is Kong? Who is Kong? You're Kong, right? This is my boss, we want you to fight for us. I offer you $20K, win or lose. No... I can't... Stupid! Boss... Is $20K for real Damn! None of your business! What will I get if I bring him to you? No. We did it before. Do it in private. This is private... and it's my private part. Ouch! Direct hit! That's hurt, Boss! You kicked my balls. It hurts. I'll give you $10K to compensate. What the hell! It's shedding blood. It's about time... Get up! Get up! The rain stopped? If... I'm crippled for the rest of my life... will you stay with me? Just kidding! The doctor said I'll be able to run soon. I promised I'll take care of you. With an iron plate... the kick will be much powerful! Now we've saved... $4M already. Have you decided how to use it? Kong, when you receive this message... I'm on my way home in Henan. Please forgive me for not seeing you. I probably won't come back again. You're my only friend in Hong Kong. I'll never forget you. Thank you so much for your $100K. I think I can open up a small shop. Visit me if you come to Henan. The head, Chan Shing. Captain's gone. Where're you going? Toilet. What's up? You haven't told me what to do with our money. Kong... Why do you like me? I... I like your look... And you way you treat me and care for me. You helped me a lot and made good decisions for me. I'm stupid. You're much smarter. But when I'm with you... I feel comfortable. I remember that hotpot dinner with you... You said... if you have nothing to eat, nobody will be hungry. But I was poor then... and dare not say a single word. But today... I wanna tell you... if you're hungry, I'll feel bad. Why? What have you done? Nothing... what? What have you done to Tin! I did nothing at all... Impossible! You must have done something evil! Never. Wait... What did she say? She said nothing! But I know you must have something to do with her death! No! Honestly, she's been taking our money. She wanted us to give her a share, otherwise... she'll mess us up... I don't believe it! Tin's not that kind of person! It's true... she has been... It couldn't be! You liar! You're only her tool, stupid! Stop lying! Freeze! Police! Drop your knife! Stop! Drop your knife! Chi. What? Come in. Great body. Hush... show some respect. Dead for how long? 28 hours. God bless your soul... She let out the tears of her whole life. God bless you... I'll always remember when I was 15... a Hong Kong rich guy came to our school... and gave each student a pair of sneakers. They were my first pair of real shoes. Before that I only wore slippers. You're lucky. I never put on anything before 12. But I've heard people said... certain Italian shoes are really comfortable. It's called something like "Ferragamo". The name already sounds great!
