Hello ? Brother ? The Wife there ? - Wife ? - Yeah. Wife. Who ? Your Wife ! Sayoko ? She's gone. Say: "My sister" "Sister." Waiters dont have to kneel. It's strange. It's like our rule. - Been a long time. - You talk. - Her friend ? - Cheer up ! Akira. I can't pay for drinks at a place like this. Be my guest. Sayoko's taken all my assets. Change places. All your assets ? Yeah. 20 Million yen. 20 million ? Keep talking. Sayako said she wanted a house with a garden. I quit drinking. At the office. My fellow workers talked behind my back. I put up with it and saved for her. You told the cops ? - No. - That's good. Kiss me goodbye. What about a sauna ? Show me Sis's note again ! Didn't she like the moon ? I don't know. But I think I know how she felt. You know ? Vaguely. My patience ends every hour. Let's go. Is there a sauna around here ? Sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. Suwa, it's your turn. Thank you for coming. Rinko will take care of you. Welcome. Let's go upstairs. My Name is Rinko. Mine's Suwa. This is my first time. You stripped already ? This is your first time ? Come here ... Take off your glasses. I forgot. Take off your pants. Get in the tub. Got Kids ? No. Good. I don't feel like working. Then you can't live. I have money. It's been ages since I bathed. Even if your wife is gone, take a shower at least. I will rinse it off. Excuse me. Shall we go ? The check please. I could not come. I got hard, but I could not come. You are serious ? I didn't love her. Techniques count at that point. Without Sayoko ... I can't do it. Brother ! Sayoko ... What are you looking at ? My favorite size. I want you ... I will sponge it. Stop ! You hate gays ? No ... Your piss was salty. Sorry ... Unless you are gay, don't hang around here ! This is a public park, right ? Akira ... You all right ? I cooked a chinese meal. You can eat it. You hungry ? Sure, I've always been hungry. - That hurts. - You are all right ? Sayoko was a lousy cook. I used to cook for her. I taught her cooking, since she was marrying you. But she had no talent. She said, that the two of you had a big fight. She hates me. I am at Daido Construction Company Delicious ! Everybody knows it went bankrupt. No visitors come to the company. Daido Construction was founded in 1893. Itï½´s total debts are estimated at all of 240 Billion yen. Is that your company ? Yes. Your retirement fee ? I'm not sure I can get it. Akira. Is there a job for me ? What happened ? I can't stay here forever. I need money to look for Sayoko. Don't worry. I sold them. Sold what ? You ask what ? Your computer, telephone, TV set and ... You sold my computer ? It's useless now. Here. I'm going to work. KEEP OUT ! Going out ? Akira. May I go with you ? Where to ? Akira. Is this a Gangster office ? Yes, but the boss is gone. Where to ? The pen. He killed a guy. His mob's in a jam. His son is trying to run it. But he's not the type. Morning. Good Morning. He wants a computer engineer, eh ? Yeah, so he said. My brother. I'm his brother. My big brother. Do you like fishing ? Is Akira working here ? He'll never make a mobster. He's dangerous garbage. Can't help it. We were pals when we were kids. Shall we go ? Why me instead of a real accountant ? We have a real accountant. Then why ? Akira asked us. Been paid ? See to my brother. I see. I got it. Akira ! We caught him. Come with me. Follow me. Hurry ! In there ? Take him out ! You Remember ? He's the one ? Stand up ! Come ... You married ? Make this. That's it. Good. Touch your wife's pussy ? Nerves are fuzzy ... Just when you realize you are hurt, it hurts. Forgive me. I apologize. Don't apologize to me. Remember. He's my brother. Got it ? You go watch. Give me that. Open your mouth. Open it ! It got in. That's enough. Stop. That's enough. I didn't ask you to go that far. You didn't ? No. Brother ... Was Sis good in bed ? She was terrific. I'm glad. You can say that. Why did you come ? Don't waste your money. Don't do anything. Just let me stay. You have changed, Mr. Suwa. Remember my name ? It's my job. Have I changed ? You have a scar on your face ... and somehow you look older. Older ? What are you thinking ? Nothing. About your wife ? Aren't you unmanly ? You are here, but yet you can't forget your wife ... Take it off ! It's too much. It's a woman's vitals. Ass ! Sorry. What an ass ! Who's an ass ? You are, old man. Who's an old man ? You ! Knock it off ! Knock it off ! Ouch ! Old Man. You're terrific ! I haven't done anything yet. Stay like this. Kiss me. Kiss me. Put your tongue in. Give me your saliva. Bite my shoulder. Bite harder ! I'm coming. Come ! No rubber. Don't you mind ? I want you ! Looks good. It's ready. I'm glad I can eat this part. Tongue, I mean. Old man. Yes ? What is it ? Let's live together ! What about Sis ? Don't you have something to do ? It's all settled. She walked out. She left me. That shows how she felt about me. She took your money. It's her salary. For cooking, laundry, cleaning ... and Sex. I didn't count on it anyway. What do you mean ? She'll go to her man's place. But before that, she'll wander around Japan. Her man ? She eloped with a mobster called Takaoka. He was knocked out of his gang. That gang ? Yeah, that's why they pay you. He was good looking. A rake. Sis met him at my place. A year ago. Since then ... What ? An affair. Why didn't you tell me ? I wasn't sure. Then they both disappeared. It rang a bell. But it's still just my guess. Yumi, come. It's okay, Akira. I'm not concerned. Starting tonight, he'll live with me I'll miss him. I know you will. This place was built as a house to sell. It's well made. You borrowed from a shark, ey ? Count on brother's money ? Why ? Otherwise you wouldn't live with him. I love him, that's why. You love your client ? Is it strange ? Sure is. How come ? He could be your father. I have no father. His wife walked out on him. And his firm went bankrupt. I'm sniveling. My bathing fee and for your services. Don't count on my brother's money. Pay your interest. - Akira, come. - Here's okay. What's on your mind ? You just watch. She sells what she likes to do. She's a born whore. Face up ! Groan ! All right. Your ass. Raise it ! Get your ass up ! Not here. Come ! Strip. Strip ! Your ass ! Raise your ass ! Get it up ! Stop ! Wait a second. Her pussy is nice. I envy you. You can lay her for free. You could have laid her, too. Akira, I quit being a whore. Today's was my last time. So get out of my life ! All right. Do you think you can get another job ? Piss off ! She's like you. Let's go ! Brother ! I'm sorry. I'm broke. Can I stay with you ? I'm sorry. I didn't think you liked me. I'm a man whose wife ran away. You weren't serious. I'm not wet. I didn't enjoy it. I'm not wet, I didn't enjoy it. Dammit ! He used salad oil ! Don't cry. Quit crying ! Does my breath smell ? Yes, a little. - It does ? - Does it bother you ? Don't you mind ? Breath out ! A finger. Whose ? Mine. See ? This is a fake. I thought I'd bring it soon. I had no chance. It's rotten now. Why did you do it ? No other way. Bring it while it's fresh. I know, a freezer would have helped. I'll throw it away. This one, too. Put it in the garbage can. - Which one ? - The real one. How much do you owe ? 7 million yen. How can you pay it ? Do you feed him enough ? I'm not hungry. Akira, don't bother us. We live from hand to mouth. But we're happy. You fell victim to fraud ? Let's go. I'll wait here. Who are you ? Do you remember Rinko of the bathhouse ? I don't think so. How could you forget her ? I forgot her ! He forgot her. - ASS ! - Stay away ! Hey, let's talk ! You all right ? I hurt his shoulder. Where's Rinko's money ? I paid my debts. Spent it all ? All right. I'll talk. I've spent it on the horses. And whores ? My folks ran out on me. I heard about Rinko, so I went to see her. - She's nice, ey ? - Tops in the joint. She's my broad. Did I eat one of those chickens ? No, I bought it somewhere else. Glad to hear. Still have the money ? No. Yes, I still have some. Where is it ? Will you tell me ? Where is it ? You go get it. Go ! What's this ? Only This ? Sorry, this is all. An ambulance. The phone. Send an ambulance. He's dead. What'll we do ? Run with me. We're accomplices, Yumi and I. Only about the money, not the murder. An accident. You didn't mean to. Yes, I did. Don't say that, please. No time to look for Sis. Let's go. Get out of Tokyo. Let's look for her. Her money will be yours. Go abroad with the money. Try, it's coming. Look forward. You and Akira on a trip ? He'll be busted soon. He'll remember the trip all his life. You found your wife, too. You must settle it. Knock it off. You live with me, because your wife walked out. Yet you are going to see her ? You were abandoned ... and I picked you up. How ridiculous ! You'll go with Akira like his dad ? It's not a picnic. Fool ! Are you all right ? What's wrong ? I'll just go to get my money back ! Pay me, pay for what I did for you, then leave ! Coming with us ? Can't I ? I'll go with you. Old man, where's your ex-wife ? A friend of mine in Kanazawa knows about Takaoka. He eloped with her. She eloped with him ? I see. Beautiful ! Here we are. Here we are. Wake up ! I'll see my pal, you'll see the sights. - I'll call you. - See you later ! Let's go in. This teahouse SHIMA was built in 1820. Nothing has been changed. It's original form has been maintained. People often mistake TEAHOUSE for HOUSE OF ILL FATE. In the feudal age, teahouses were ... the only place for society. Old man ! Come on down. Oh, nothing. Go up. - Old man ! - Let's go over there ... Akira. Come here. Move the bedding. - No, thanks. - Come on. Don't bother. I can't sleep. He's snoring. You love him ? I realized he was broke. When you raped me, I thought he'd walk out on me. I thought I could get rid of him that way. But he stayed. Then I took to loving him. How come ? His sex. What else ? Is he that good ? - I can't believe it. - He's like my rabbit. Rabbit ? I kept one when I was a kid. It would crawl after me. It crawled ? That one did. Sounds like him. Brother ! I see. I got it. They are in Minazuki. Minazuki means EVERYONE IS THE MOON It's on a peninsula. He tried to give money to his mom. Sharks found him. Did he try to be a good son to her ? I made a deal with them. About his debts ... They told me to collect. If I flopped, I'd give him to them. What for ? They'd sell his guts. - Guts ? - I mean bowels. How about my wife ? She'll be safe. The sea ! Great ! I feel nice ! Great ! The sea ! Come quick ! Cold ! Quick ! Hurry ! Old man ! Still wanting those pants ? Your color is pure white ! You are pure white ! Your color is pure white ! That's Takaoka's place ! MINAZUKI INN The police wants me. I'll sleep in the car. You two use it. NO TRESPASSING ! - What's up ? - You were gone. - Wait a minute. - What's wrong ? Piss. - Piss ? - Go ahead. Don't watch me. Old man. Your marriage ? I wonder what it was. I was watching TV while eating. Maybe I was a boring husband. All I gave my wife was my salary, my plunging son, and my juice. I'll leak. Don't. I'll leak. I'll really leak. I'm leaking. Don't. Don't ! - You bashful ? - Not that. Then what ? Don't leave me. - Why should I ? - Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Please don't. Yumi. You are the sun. Meaning ? My Wife wrote EVERYONE IS THE MOON in her note. It's this area's name. So she came here. I'm not the sun, but the moon. Akira is the moon, too. And my wife and her man are moons, too. But ... you are not the moon, but the sun. I don't understand, but I'm glad. "This is Yumi. Do you read me ?" This is "Old man". "I love you." Will they really come ? Just wait. Want some ? It's been five days already. Why not leave then ? I'll stay. I like this place, too. Akira, it's them. My wife and her man. They are coming. Yumi, I'll settle it. You wait. Hey, let us alone. No, you can't see your mom anymore. Watch out ! Akira, you all right ? Sayoko ! You all right ? I sure am. Luck's with me. It's enough. Let's go. - You go. - See to him, Sayoko. He used that one ? Don't ! STOP IT ! Forgive him ? You said it's just the start, didn't you ? Don't make your sister sad. I didn't think you'd come with Akira. I wanted to see my mom. She's doing all right. Brother, we'll go first. Why Takaoka ? He's from Minazuki. He wrote it down. It rang a bell. I liked the words meaning. EVERYONE IS THE MOON I was enchanted by the name. I thought that I, You ... and Akira were all moons. The moon doesn't shine. It only reflects light. Takaoka phoned me ... after I told you I'd cook curry. He needed money for his ailing mother. He lied. I'd like to take a leak. Go ahead. Speak. The sun shone in his eyes. Just like through clouds. He shone on me ... You were an honest moon. You only showed the same side. You never showed the other side of the moon. Neither did I. I can't blame you. I can understand it very well. What's up ? Seems Akira took that man to his mother. Brother, the bag. Your divorce. Sign it. I walked out on him. But it's like you stole him. Akira, what are you going to do ? See the cops. - What did you do ? - Murder. Why ? You don't have to run anymore. I won't be chased. My name is Akira Hanada, the murderer. You killed the poultryman ? Heï½´s turning himself in. Your name ? Check on it. Akira Hanada. Who are they ? I tried to kill myself to apologize. My brother stopped me. He said to atone for what I did. So I'm confessing to it. Thank you. Let's go. Just a moment. Sis. Bite me. When did you do this ? When you married. You are a fool. Sis, bite me harder. I'll be waiting. Thanks. Sorry, brother. He can't marry. Poor guy. Marriage isn't everything. When will Akira be released ? Maybe in ten years or so. I'll be 34 then. I'll be 58, almost 60. I'll be a real duffer. Listen. Can I stop off at Maebashi ? My mother's there. I haven't seen her lately. Come with me. I'll be there at night. EVERYONE IS THE MOON. I CAN'T HANG ON ANYMORE. GOODBYE. I'm not the sun. Not the moon, either. I'm just a foolish woman. A mere slut.
