Junko FUJI Kyosuke MACHIDA, Minoru OKI Eizo KITAMURA, Kenji USHIO, Toshiaki MINAMI Shinji, this is no time to be daydreaming! I'm worried about my gas, so I can't go any faster. OK. I'll do something about that, so just use what you have. OK! Don't dilly-dally! See you later! Bin AMATSU, Michitaro MIZUSHIMA Thanks for waiting! I'll leave the rest up to you! Bunta SUGAWARA Directed by: Shigehiro OZAWA Isamu... I guess that's where it all is. Shall we have a little fun? In other words, he's saying he can't just give a pig that wandered into a military zone back that easily, so how about a date? I think it might work out. Let's challenge him to a barrel with this. You got a deal. He said he wants a date and a kiss and if he loses he'll give us two barrels. Are you sure? No way! Is this truck number 32 This is the new addition to Yonamine Transport. This one is good. It's great about getting a new truck, but we have no gas. We have to do something. I told the boss, but... Hey! Look, we got three barrels! Where did you get that? The boss won it in a poker match. You did it again. I thought I told you not to do that. The new truck is here... We're going to have a party tonight! What's tomorrow's schedule like? This is it... I'll drive tomorrow, so could you watch the office? I can't let you take all the burden yourself. Don't worry about it. I'm just doing what my parents did to build this company to what it is today. But... If they didn't die in the war, you wouldn't be doing this... Don't talk about that! I thought I made you promise me that you wouldn't treat me like a girl until I rebuild this company to what it used to be. I'm sorry. Isamu... you look happy. Did something happen? We got a new truck, so I can drive starting tomorrow. You're finally a full-fledged driver. Don't get too close in front of all these people. Why? Our boss lost someone she loved in the war. I didn't know that. Gunso, are you thinking about the main island again? I'm fine when I'm working, but I start to remember the past when I come to places like this. Was your home in Kumamoto? Why don't you go home once? Everyone thinks I was shot and killed after escaping a POW camp. I can't go home now... I'm sure my wife forgot about me by now. Who are those guys? They're some yakuza that came from the main island. They're always like this. Don't let them get to you. Would you like some flowers? Give me one. Me, too! They're such cheap flowers. Is this the only kind of flowers you have in Okinawa? I bet you have better flowers... Stop that! Are you all right? You're quite a beauty. You shouldn't be using things like that... The people of Okinawa fight one on one. I'm Okinawan. I can't fight with a woman, but anyone want to take me on? I'll take you on. I'm Daisuke Iba. Third level Shuriken. I'm Kensaku Yashiro. Judo. That's it. The fight is over. We fight until someone dies. Get out of the way. Are you dissatisfied with my judgment? Your judgment? I don't need to be humiliated. Teach me something. Very well. Stop right there. You're quite the brave one. I'm Iwamatsu. I hear you own a trucking company. I'm Yuri Yonamine. I run a business as well. Can we just call it water under the bridge and talk business? Unfortunately, I have work to do, so... I'm sorry we got in the way of your work. I'll buy all of that. I'll hold it. Thank you. I wish you would stop doing this kind of work. Yes... But, my village has a lot of debt and we all have to work or we won't be able to repay the debt. Where is your village? Aragusuku in Gushikami. Aragusuku? Boss, I'll take her home. I'm fine. I always walk home when I'm late. Why don't you stay at my place tonight? I'll take you home with my car in the morning. Thank you. What happened to your leg? I hurt it when I was little in the war. What about your family? My grandmother and I are the only survivors. Have a good night's rest. This cave is completely surrounded by the U.S. We will prepare ourselves to proudly sacrifice our lives for our country. Follow me! For those who don't follow me, I want you to use the weapons I just gave you to take your lives. Father... Mother... You're still young. You don't have to die. Escape. I don't need this anymore. I have a younger sister that is about the same age as you. I was told she died in an air raid. Don't die. Be careful. Thank you very much. I'll walk you home. Do you know the house that was here? No. Did it belong to someone you knew? It's where my mother was born. So you're from this village, too. Yes, but all of my relatives died in the war. I haven't been here in a long time. Sachiko, what happened to you last night? Your grandma was waiting for you. I stayed at her place since it was too late. Thank you. I'm Keisuke Asada, the mayor here. I'm Yuri Yonamine. Yuri? So you're Rika's daughter. She used to live here. Yes. Is that so? I've heard about you. I'm glad to see you doing well. Your mother and I used to play together when we were little. This used to be a quiet village back then. This became a battleground during the war where most of the families in this village have died. How about your family? Yes, my parents and my siblings. I was away at war... I'm still happy to be alive even with this injury. How about your mother? She died with my father near Mabuni. I see. I'm sure you had a hard time after the war. No... I was preoccupied with work and never even had time to think about my mother's hometown at all. I learned for the first time yesterday that you're all struggling here. Please tell me if there's anything I can do. We borrowed a lot of money to start this sugarcane field. This land was bare until last year and we felt we had to do something, so we borrowed some money from a loan company and planted these sugarcanes from seedlings that we got from Hawaii. The sugarcane is doing well, but we aren't able to pay the monthly interest on the loan, and if we don't do something, all of our profits will be taken away after November. I'm responsible for all of this, but everyone has been helping selling flowers and such... How much did you borrow? 12,000 dollars. Our village is so poor. We don't have anything we could soil to make money. All we have are just these things. Are there more? Yes. We found a lot when we were cultivating the land. We put them all at that garbage dump over there. Price for scrap has gone up. Why don't you sell these? We thought about it, but we don't have any means to transport it. I'll help you. But, you have other jobs to take care of. I don't mind. Please allow me. Yuri... Hey! The truck is here! What do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. Sony? We work here. Be careful, you fool! I'm the supervisor here. Please have a seat. You seem quite busy. Let me get right to the point. How much per ton will you give us for today's delivery? It doesn't look like you have anything of much value. It would help us greatly if you would buy it at market price. Our village depends on it. The policy says that we only need to pay you a service fee for bringing the scrap since the U.S. military takes care of all of that. Yes, but it goes for 50 dollars per ton when handed off to the U.S. military and 10 times as much when it's sold to the main island. We can have you take it back if you're going to be trouble. We're the only ones that have been granted special rights to gather these scraps. You should watch your attitude here. I apologize if I was rude. I'm making a request. We haven't settled our fight from last night either. Let me think about it. Will you be able to pay for it now? After it sells. That's fine. Thank you very much. Aren't you the mayor of Aragusuku? Yes. I'm asking you this as a personal favor. Could you deliver this to my family? I can't leave this place since they're watching me. Watching you? They're putting the scraps on a black market ship. What? Please... I heard rumors, but I can't believe it's true. Boss, we found this in the scrap that they just brought. Is it a live bomb? No, this is an old Japanese artillery. It belonged to the Japanese military? Boss, I heard about a cave near Aragusuku that they used as a storage for artillery. This might be... Are there a lot of caves near Aragusuku? Yes. If the storage is untouched then there must be a lot. The U.S. military doesn't know about it, so this would be a huge treasure chest to send to Hong Kong. This is interesting. Let's get that artillery and make some money. Iba, I want you to be the lead and check it out. Yes. Stop. You can't go through past this point. On whose orders? We're representatives of the military. Just do as we say. Get out of here. How's it going? I want you to be thorough. What are you doing? Stop! The sugarcane is our livelihood! Stop! Please make them stop. We need to do this for our excavation project. I hope you're going to compensate us for this. Just plant it again. You... There are a lot of soldiers' remains in this cave! I'm responsible for this property until all of those remains are removed! I won't let you do this! Just do as you want. I'm going to go ahead with out plans. Ma'am! And you call yourselves Japanese? Do you know how hard these people worked to plant this sugarcane? Mr. Iba, you're an Okinawan. I'm sure you understand. Just get out of here. I'm not going to move until you leave this place. Yuri, let me handle this. Mr. Iwamatsu, if you insist on continuing your work, then I have a plan as well. I'm going to confirm with the military whether your actions are legal or not. That's fine. I have a friend that's an officer. Would you like me to introduce you to him? I'm going to ask about your black market in Hong Kong as well! I don't know what you're talking about, but do whatever you want! Help me! Boss, it seems he asked them to deliver a message. I just wanted to send my wife and kids some money. I was paying you so well. You're such a fool. I was able to figure most of it out. How was it? Toyo Industries is registered under a foreign name and it seems Iwamatsu owns the rights to the company. It seems they use that foreigner to get the ship to transport the scraps to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, I don't know what port. What's the foreigner's name? James Harrison. That's all I need to know. I'm going to see the general. I'll go with you. No, I'll be fine by myself. Please pretend that you don't know anything if the U.S. military asks you. Mayor! Mr. Asato! Yuri... Please take care of the sugarcane field. Mr. Asato! You must be Mr. Nakagami. I work for the Iwamatsu group. I'm here to pick you up. Please... Iwamatsu group? You have the wrong person. Wait a minute. Just get in. Sit there and wait. Are you deaf? You fool! Don't be rude to our guest. Mr. Nakagami, I'm sorry for the way my boys are behaving. I'm Gunji Iwamatsu of the Iwamatsu group of Kyushu. I guess you know who I am. I'm Nakagami from Tokyo, but what do you want from me? This is a newspaper from the main island. There's a huge article. NAKAGAMI GROUP LEADER... NATIONWIDE SEARCH! I received a message from my office in Kyushu that you were going to enter Okinawa illegally. I thought it would be rude if we ignored that message, so I sent my boys to pick you up. Please enjoy yourself while you're here. Thank you for your hospitality, but I've been a lone wolf my entire life. I don't want to be obligated to anyone. I fought against the Americans here during the war. I lost a lot of men... ...And there are those I want to see. So, please don't worry about me. I just want to relax and walk around town. If that's what you want. But please let us know if we can be of any help. Would you be able to loan me a car? Sure. That guy... Oh, be quiet. He's so persistent. Be careful! Right back at you! Is there some rule that says I can't pass you? We drive on the right in Okinawa, so if you want to pass someone you pass them on the left. I forgot. I was wrong. But you sure are rough. I can't believe you're a woman. I'm not a woman. Do what you want. What's with that guy? Where are you headed for? To Aragusuku. Were you hired by Iwamatsu, too? No, but I'm surprised you're so informed. You're going to help him dig up some artillery, rights? Artillery? I'm going to see some friends. So you were in the battle here in Okinawa? We lost the war while I was injured in the hospital. I'm going to see the man who saved my life. I heard he's the mayor of Aragusuku now. Is his name Asato? Yes, do you know him? Mr. Asato died. Died? We're laying him to rest today. Hurry up! Don't dilly-dally! I know! Hurry up! Hurry up! It looks like it would be around here. Carry this. That's so dangerous. So are you saying Iwamatsu's boys did this to him? I can't confirm it, but I'm sure they did. He was a good man. He would never have any enemies. How dare they... But, aren't you a yakuza like them? Yoshiko... Yoshiko... Mom... Mom! Mom! Mr. Iwamatsu. Young lady... I need to talk to you. Let's have a drink. This is no time to be drinking. You... Three mothers have died because of you. So what? Mr. Iwamatsu, let's have you pay for their compensation and for the scrap that we delivered to you. Unfortunately, we'll be handing it over to the U.S. military since there were some hazardous materials in that delivery. We have nothing to do with the three that died. They were careless, that's all. You forced them to work there! We didn't force anyone. This is the deed for the land that the mayor used as collateral to get the loan. I paid it off for them. We settled it by having the people of Aragasuku pay this off by working for us. We have the new mayor's signature as well. Do you still have more to say? Go on home. Mr. Iwamatsu, I'm still not convinced. If you insist on continuing what you're doing, I'll go directly to the GHQ myself. I won't die that easily like Mr. Asato. You! Don't be pulling things like that in front of people. Mr. Iwamatsu, it looks like you have a lot going on here. I know where that storage that you're looking for is. You? I was the leader of the heavy artillery regiment. So I've been to the cave many times to retrieve weapons. Where is it? Calm down. It's been a while, so my memory isn't too clear yet. Why don't we sit down and talk about it? I have something to talk to you about later. Let me handle this and go on home. Mr. Nakagami, please have a seat. Please give this to the children from today... How about rethinking what you're doing? I have a criminal record, so Iwamatsu was the only one who would hire me. I made Iwamatsu agree that he would stop all work until I finish my research. He's such a greedy fool. I don't have to do any research. And? I want to borrow your truck. If my calculations are correct, we should be able to transport all of the artillery in three days using all three trucks all day. I talked to Shinwa Industries to do this sale under the table. That should take care of the debt. I understand what you want to do, but please get the money for the children that lost their mothers from Iwamatsu first. We can use the money that we'll get from selling the artillery. I need you to do this or I won't be able to trust you. You're in the same business as Iwamatsu, right? The village people aren't going to work for you otherwise. Yes, I am a yakuza. But I'm not like Iwamatsu. I was known as Nakagami of Ginza. I've never scammed a commoner. Then I would like you to do the right thing here. I want to take revenge for Mr. Asato. Don't you understand that? I can't go to that village until we compensate the children for losing their mothers. I was the reason why this whole thing started. All right. I won't ask for your help! You're so stubborn! You're the one that's stubborn! I can't believe you're a woman. The Okinawan women I met during the war were much cuter. I think you should trust him. The Okinawan women I met during the war were much cuter. Who's there? It's you. What are you doing here? You're that girl? Don't die. Ma'am. I have some great news. The fishermen have been bringing up loads of abandoned artillery that are under water. They just want the gunpowder, so they don't know what to do with the scraps. It seems they have enough to fill two truckloads. We can sell that without going through Iwamatsu. Yes, it's Shinwa Industries' jurisdiction, so we should be able to get enough to compensate the children. Let's go! Thank you. Gunso! Are you all right? I can't move my legs. Hold on! It's a time bomb. Boss, get out! You, too! It's a time bomb. I must have triggered the timer. Hurry! Get out of here. Tell the everyone to take cover. Run! Please run! What happened? Mr. Nakagami, there's a man stuck under a time bomb. A time bomb? Boss... don't worry about me. Please get out of here. Boss. Mr. Nakagami.. The timer is moving. Get me some tools and don't let anyone come within 500 meters of this place. Get out of here. I'm going to help. You fool! I said go! Gunso, do you remember any military songs? Sing it to me. Ma'am! It's done. Thank you, Mr. Nakagami. Yuri... I came here because I wanted to talk to you again. I've become someone not worthy of respect, but you should go back to being the cute girl you used to be. You'll be happier that way. Please don't ruin the dream of a man who came all the way here to see you. I don't like men from the main island. My late mother always said people from the main island were very nice, but they all just passed through Okinawa. They never looked at the reality of this island. Those people who just pass through this island will never know how we really feel. But, I'll help you from tomorrow. It's here. It's a pit viper. It's over here. Some of these still have their fuses, so tell your men to be careful. Yes. Be careful. Please let us help you. This is dangerous, so please don't come near here. Thank you. It's heavy. Please be careful. The rest of you can come this way. Thank you. That Nakagami... Start the preparations. Do whatever you need to do to stop Nakagami. I won't let you tell me no. I understand. Get it ready. Thank you. They're coming! You idiot! Isamu! Isamu! Kanamaru! Isamu! Nakagami, I'm here to take your life! Do you work for Iwamatsu? Mr. Iba... Don't kill him. Please spare his life. Please! Yuri... He's... Mr. Iba... Go... Isamu... They were going to get married next month. Yes? Is a man by the name of Tetsu Nakagami here? He's on suspicion of entering illegally with a fake passport. We're going to search the premises. Get out of my way. Wait... Please wait! There's no one by that name here. Iwamatsu ratted me out. Don't be foolish. Okinawa is not like Japan. It's controlled by the U.S. Let me handle Iwamatsu. You should go back to the main island. How do I get there? I guess a person from Nagoya can't communicate with a person from Okinawa. Nakagami... No, he's not a fish monger. Be quiet! Nakagami! Are you crazy? That's right! What? Excuse me. Let me cross. It's so hot here in Okinawa. Why I am running? I didn't do anything. I'm from Kanto... Kanto is a big area... I was born near Sumida River. My grandparents were born in Asakusa, too. Please... It's here. Is he really here? Gunso... this man is looking for Mr. Nakagami. Nice to meet you. Is that the office? Ouch! Hey! Come out here! Hide! Boss... I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you. I'm so sorry. Why are you under the truck? I've come to rescue you. It's been a while. That's dirty! Fool. Ouch. Boss, the coast is clear. This is the only kind of place I can have a drink since they're all after me. Thank you for waiting. How did you get here? From Kagoshima... That's creepy... There's a hole... The ear... I entered here illegally. I'm sorry. Yes... Have some. This? No way! How did it go in Tokyo? The Daitokai group came to apologize to us. One of their men testified that you weren't at the scene. I see. Boss... please come home as soon as possible. We have more territory and more jobs. Everyone is waiting for you. I did it... It stinks. I didn't think it would be good to bring cash, so I brought the checkbook and your stamp. I'm not going home to Tokyo. What did you just say? I'm leaving the group. I want you to talk it over with everyone and manage the group. Boss, are you serious? I'll pay my respects once I'm done here. I have a favor to ask of you. Could you let me write any amount I want as a severance pay? Please tell them this is my last request. Boss... never mind about the money... I guess it wasn't a good idea to come to a place that's so hot. You really do go senile... Can't you walk faster? Listen up! You all have a 12,000 dollar debt! You better work hard! Boss, I have a favor to ask of you. Could you stop making the women and elderly do this hard labor? - It's too dangerous. - We don't have time. We need to clean it all up by today or tomorrow if we want to put it on that boat to Hong Kong. But, we've had an accident before... Who do you think you are talking to me like that? You can't even do one thing right. Boss... I can't take this anymore. Please let me leave. What? Please... Boss... Who do you think took you in when you were homeless and made you into the man you are today? How dare you forget that. Iba, I'll take care of you later. Hurry up! She was hiding in the village. What do you think she could do? What? She's for our enjoyment! Get back to work! Let me go! Help me! Stop! Look over there! Stay down. They're threatening the people with their guns and doing things I can't bear to watch. They have the entire village surrounded and there's no way you can get in. Here's 20,000 dollars. Give this to the people of Aragusuku. Just do as I say. Mr. Nakagami.. Boss! Sachi... Are you all right? Mr. Iba... Take him inside. Mr. Iba! Where is she? She's safe. She's right here. Thank you, Mr. Iba. I... ...couldn't even repay you for your kindness. No... You're one of us! Thank you. Mr. Iba! Mr. Nakagami! Get off! I'm coming with you. This is not something a woman should do. Fool! I'm not going back to the main island. Just let me do as I please. Boss! Boss! Miss Yuri! Surround them! Find him! There he is! Mr. Nakagami! Go! Mr. Nakagami.. Yuri! Find him! Don't let him get away! Please go back to the main island. I don't want to be a man who just passes by. I came here... ...because I wanted to see you. Mr. Nakagami! Never mind about me! Go after him! Okinawa belongs to America. No matter what the reason, the crimes you have committed are heinous, however... Yuri Yonamine, you are declared innocent and will be released immediately. According to Tetsu Nakagami's statement and our investigation, we determined that he shall hold the burden of this crime. Please wait! He will be executed. Please wait! I did it! Please wait! He didn't do it! Mr. Nakagami! Don't die! Don't die! Mr. Nakagami! Don't die! Mr. Nakagami! TETSU NAKAGAMI THE END
