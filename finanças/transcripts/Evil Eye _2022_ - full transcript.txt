A long time ago, in a faraway and mysterious land, the kind that now exist only in fairytales, there lived three sisters. They were triplets. This drew everybody's attention every time they accompanied their mother to the village. But when all eyes are focused on you sometimes, evil turns its gaze too. - No. - How long? The shot! Hold it. What happened, Mommy? Nothing, dear. It's the third attack this week. Her organs are beginning to fail, and she's becoming resistant to treatment. It's best to hospitalize her and make arrangements. Thank you, Doctor. Didn't you hear the doctor? She needs to be in a hospital or close to one, not in a town in the middle of nowhere! We're not taking Luna to a hospital. Why don't you listen to the experts? They know what they're doing. You heard your experts before, they said she'd die. We've taken her to doctors here, Houston, everywhere. Your science doesn't work. You're crazy. We're not leaving Luna's life in hands of... In whose hands? They are my hands. This is going to work. Trust me. We're leaving tomorrow. Honey. In the suitcase or with you? With me. Nala. Hurry up and pack, dear. Will you hurry up and pack, please? - Ready? - I simply can't handle her. Looks like somebody woke up on the wrong foot. How would you feel if they made you go to a town in the middle of nowhere? Honey. It's for Luna's sake. Your mom believes we can find help for her there. Everything is for Luna. Don't forget your bathing suit. Your mom told me once that they had a pool. Nala, will you hurry up, please? Bye! Becca! Are you taking Luna to treatment? No. We're travelling to visit family. That's great. You can't live from hospital to hospital. Miguel, stay away from Luna. She's very fragile. Better safe than sorry, he has a cold again. I wouldn't want her to catch it, on top of everything else Luna has... Yes. I don't know where he caught it, several kids in the building are sick. You go ahead. I forgot something at home. Here, now that I see you. BUNDLE UP YOUR CHILDREN - WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE SICK KIDS IN THE BUILDING Listen. You're practically an adult. I need to be able to count on you. This trip won't be easy. I will need your full support. Luna needs you. I need you. I'm coming on the damn trip, aren't I? What more do you want? I don't know where I messed up with you. I could make a list. EVIL EYE Move, asshole! Daddy said a bad word. Are you angry, Daddy? No, honey. Daddy's nervous because he's meeting his mother in law. What's a mother in law, Mommy? It's another word for headache, dear. Guillermo! - What's that? - A funeral for a child. Nala! It's a goodbye party, honey. For a child who went to Heaven. To the angels? Yes, honey. To the angels. We're here. - Everything all right? - Yes. Get out, girls, and meet Grandmother Josefa. Finally I get to meet you two. Such beautiful girls. Hi, Grandmother. Little Luna. Oh, mamita. You must be Nala. It's a pleasure. You look a lot like your mom. I hope it's only on the outside. Oh, please. Don't start. How are you? Obviously, not as well as you, Rebecca. Mrs. Josefa. It's such a pleasure. Please, don't call me Mrs. Josefa. It makes me feel older. Sorry. Josefa. It's a pleasure. The pleasure is all mine. Honey, can you bring our bags? No, leave that. I'll tell Pedro to bring them in. Girls, let's go explore Grandmother's house, okay? This family was in need of a handsome man like you. You said the house had three stories, Mommy. Yes, honey, it has three stories. The third story is the attic, where Granny Teresa's room used to be. Is that for Instagram? Right. What's the wifi password? What's wifi? There isn't even signal here, dear. You could use a few days off TikTok, anyway. This place is a dump. Nala. Why don't you take Luna to the garden? - Yes! - Yes. Go explore. You want to go bug hunting? No. Okay. Play catch? Luna, that's for little kids. Wow, there's the pool. I'm glad I brought my suit. Did my call really surprise you that much? Yes, it did. I never imagined you planned to come back. Sometimes plans change. You think I'd be here if I had a choice? But, aren't you afraid? Aren't you afraid about what could happen? Didn't you learn anything? Of course I'm afraid. But I'll do everything I have to do for my daughter. I'll tell Abigail to give them fruit. Abigail? Who's Abigail? Pedro's girlfriend. She helps me in the house. They live together in a little cabin close by. Well! The countryside is modernizing. Abigail, child. These are my granddaughters. Hello, girls! Give them some fruit and keep them here with you. Yes, Mrs. Josefa. Come in, welcome. Have a seat. Had you been in Las Ánimas before? You'd never been here? Would you like some corn pudding? Girls. I can believe you'd never been to Las Ánimas, but seriously, never eaten corn pudding? My recipe is delicious. - This one's for you. - Thank you. - And this one's for you. - Thanks. You're welcome. It's good, isn't it? I'm glad you liked it. I think this came out good too. Mommy, how long had it been since you came to Las Ánimas? Honey. You know I'm terrible at math. Not only math. Listen, Guillermo. Did you assent to coming here? Yes, of course. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, and for the girls... That's not what I asked, dear. I mean, do you agree with the purpose of this trip...? Can we change the subject? Please? It's a simple question. I think parents do everything they can for their kids. I see it every day at the building with the epidemic that's going round. There's... an epidemic in the building where you live? Kids are constantly sick. But Mom says they're not as sick as I am. Fortunately, Nala and Luna haven't caught it. Darling. Can we talk about something else? Can we? Guillermo! Do you like the cuisine of the state of Veracruz? Yes, I love it. But I have to admit that it tastes better here. That's because Rebecca is a tad insipid. What's up, girls? Everything all right? We're bored. I suppose the countryside is too quiet for you. Nala. Your grandmother sent you a gift. That's disgusting. It's not so bad. It's horrible. Well, I'll leave it here in case you decide to wear it. What do kids do for fun around here? When I was little my favorite pastime was listening to stories. Rural legends. Will you tell us one? No. Most of them are scary. I don't want to frighten you. I don't get frightened. Sure? Pretty please. Come on, come on. - What if you can't sleep later? - I will be able to sleep. - Come on. - Nala? Yes, please. Fine, but only one. Okay. The Legend of the Triplets. A long time ago, there lived three sisters. While they slept at night, an evil being started to pay them visits. It was a witch. - A witch? - Yes. A very evil witch. Witches suck children's blood in order to steal their youth so they can be young forever. What happened to the girl? Year after year, the witch sucked her blood every night. Until the girl got sick. She grew very weak, and had a lot of health issues. Every night, her sisters hid a pair of scissors under the mattress because it is thought that scissors repel witches, but it was too late. The witch had sucked too much of her blood. So, in order to help the ailing triplet, her two sisters walked to a very distant cabin where a sorceress who came from the Caribbean lived. One of the triplets was very scared but the other one was determined and was able to convince her. The sorceress proposed a deal. She would teach them how to make a Bacá and the Bacá could then save their sister's life. Vaca like cow? Bacá with a B Bacás are mythological beings that come from the darkest corner of the Caribbean. These beings make wishes come true. Whatever you ask it for. But in exchange they bring evil things to the asker. That is, Bacás give you something but demand something in return. In exchange for teaching them how to make the Bacá and save their sister's life the girls would ask for riches and give the riches to the sorceress. This way, the sorceress would reap the reward without the evil that came with it. Legend says that to make a Bacá you have to bury an ostrich egg with the blood of a goat of a snake, and of a child. Bury everything under the full moon in a special region only known to witches. The girls followed these instructions. After six nights of witchcraft something was born from the egg. Something? When you make a Bacá you can get a dog, or a cat. Sometimes a mouse. A chicken. Or even a baby. But it's a Bacá. With the Bacá, the triplet got better, although she never recovered completely. The girls kept their side of the deal and gave the riches to the sorceress. But the sorceress seduced them to keep the girls as her servants, promising to teach them the secrets of dark magic. And it turned out that one of the girls the bravest among them, was attracted by this dark magic, whereas the other girl decided to stay away from those things. Until one day the brave girl who was now an apprentice of dark magic, found her sick sister's ribbon. She discovered that the sorceress was the same witch that made her sister sick to begin with, and had rejuvenated with her blood. And she decided she had to kill her. Witches don't exist... do they? Yes. They do exist. And they're coming to get you. To eat you up in the middle of the night. Of course not, dummy. Those are stories meant to scare little kids. Well, Nala, here in the countryside you hear a lot of things. What are you three doing here? She's telling us a scary story. I forbid you from telling village stories and gossip to my daughters. They're too small to listen to that shit. Did I make myself clear? Now, stay with Luna. Nala. I need to talk to you. Come with me. Now what? Dad and I are leaving tomorrow. We'll be away a few days, I need you to look after Luna. What?! - Why are you going away? - For Luna. You know we're here to help your sister. Like, wasn't dragging us all the way over here enough? Now you're leaving me? Alone, with a bitter old hag?! We're going to look for an alternative treatment for your sister. But it's far from here, and it isn't safe for you girls. I don't want to be here, Rebecca! This damn house has bad vibes! And so does Grandmother. You're insufferable. Stop calling me by my name, I'm your mom! You call your mother by her name. Honey, honey. I understand how you feel. But I need you to stay and look after your sister. Everything is always about Luna! Do you understand that your sister is dying? You only brought me here for that, right? You know what? Think what you want. This isn't right, Becca. We have to bring them with us. We can't, babe. We don't know how she might react. So we're leaving them with your mom? You haven't seen her in years. Are you okay with that? Yes. You saw her. She's a gruff and bitter old woman, but she's harmless. The worst thing she might do is kiss them with bad breath. Babe... trust me. Nala, you're a big girl. I need to be able to trust you. When we get back, you and I are going to have a very important talk. You're of age to... It'll only be a few days. Try not to burn the house down, okay? Give Dad a hug. Nala reminds me so much of you at her age. I hope she's not as stubborn. Grandmother. I don't know if Mom told you, but I'm a vegetarian. That's nothing but a big city fad. Isn't there anything else? This isn't a diner, mamita. Luna. Eat it up for you to get well. You too, mamita. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. I don't know how your mother raised you. But in this house, we do not let food go to waste. Is that clear, mamita? Nala, you look great. That suit fits perfectly. Thank you. But I don't think you'll be able to swim. Hey! Watch out. Thanks. You have to be careful with this pool. It's been covered since I started working here. What a waste. I could clean it for you. Really? It'll be done before you leave. Nala, what are you doing? And you, Pedro, go to the kitchen. Abigail needs you. Yes, ma'am. Cover yourself! Otherwise, the locals are going to think you're a whore. Cover yourself now! Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine... How long? Luna, what's wrong? What if Mom and Dad never come back for us? Don't think that. They will be back, they only went for a few days. Luna, everything is all right. Okay? I'm here. And I will look after you. I promise. Gross, the other one. ARE YOU THERE? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU URGENTLY Luna? Luna? Luna! - Would you like some strawberries? - Yes, thank you. - Listen, Abigail. - Yes? How does the story of the triplets end? I'm not sure I should tell you. Remember what your mom said. She isn't here. No. Nala, that story is too scary for you. Luna might get scared. Luna, you weren't scared, were you? See? Come on. You can't leave us hanging on. Well, all right. Remember we left off when they discovered that the sorceress was the very witch that made their sister sick. Well, one of the triplets convinced the other one that they should kill the witch to take revenge of all the disease that had befallen their sister. One night they went into her cabin and found the witch's skin inside a pumpkin. - Her skin? - Yes. Witches take off their skin so they can fly. And they knew what would kill her. - Salt? - Yes. Salt kills witches. Later on, when the witch came home the girls were waiting for her to see if their plan worked. That night the witch died. She burned up from the inside out. But she cast the evil eye on them with her final breath. She swore that envy would consume them, and that would be their doom. What happened afterwards? They suffered one last tragedy. Girls, remember. The Bacá gives you something but always demands something in exchange. The Bacá took their mother's life. What could be worse than killing your own mother without even knowing? In light of this tragedy, the triplet who refused to make the Bacá or to use dark magic decided to amend her mistake. By now, the Bacá had grown. They say it isn't easy to kill a Bacá. But she was determined. The death of the Bacá made the triplet sick to the end of her days, while their mother's death created a deep rift between these two sisters, estranging them forever. One of them continued practicing dark magic while the other one swore to never do it again. And when it became known in the village that the triplets had turned to witchcraft, they were forced to escape. Go into hiding. Never to be seen again. - Does it work? - What? Salt. Does it kill witches? Nala. It's just a story. Nala! Why did you ask Pedro to clean the pool? He offered. I don't know how were you raised, but in this house when you want something you do it yourself. What do you mean? Go clean the pool. Now! Me? - But Grandmother... - Don't talk back at me. As long as you're in my house you will do exactly as I say, mamita. I'm not leaving Luna here alone. Mrs. Josefa, I can help... That's okay, Nala. I'll look after Luna. Go. What are you waiting for? Make sure it's sparkling clean! Did you finish? You can continue tomorrow. You know all this is for your own good, don't you? You know that, don't you, mamita? Now go to bed. You have no business roaming around so late. Nala! Luna? No! Luna, no! Luna, Luna! Luna! Good morning, sleepy head. You're the sleepy head. Hey, let's go hunting for dragonflies? I saw a bunch near the pool. - Really? - Yes. - Let's? - Yeah. Luna! Are you all right? Hold on a minute. I'll be right back. Abigail! That's what happens when you only listen to yourself. Grandmother! Luna is sick! The girls are just fine. - Call my parents! - Yes, both of them. Is that Mom? Just a minute, please. They're outside. Yes, in the garden. - Pedro cleaned the pool for them. - What? They're fine, don't worry. Good bye. I wanted to talk to her! - She was in a hurry and hung up. - That's not true! Watch your mouth, girl. Or do you want to clean the pool all day? I'm glad we agree, mamita. You're boiling, my precious. We have to call Mom and Dad. What for? There's nothing they can do. We have to let them know. Let them know what? What you did to your sister? I didn't do anything to her. Luna was perfectly fine yesterday. You slept with her. What did you do to her, mamita? It's all right. Luna is fine. And you have to eat. We don't want you to get sick too. I don't know why she won't call my parents. Mrs. Josefa probably doesn't want to worry them. Abigail. Do you think Grandmother could be... a witch like in the story? Nala. Oh, please, Nala. Don't be silly. Look, Mrs. Josefa is a tough woman, but on the inside she's all love. She would never hurt anybody. Everybody in town loves and respects her since forever. Don't get me in trouble for telling you that story. Voice mail. This call will be... Nala. What are you doing here? You came up to the attic without my permission?! Just like that. How could Rebecca rear a child like you? She disappoints me more with each day. Is there anything you do respect, mamita? Tonight you're going to bed without supper. I was looking for signal to call my parents! Is that your excuse? Give me the phone. - Give it to me! - No. I said give it to me. Let go. Let go of it! Let go, let go! No! You damn crazy old woman! Look at the house, it was pretty. What happened to it? Time happened. And Grandmother. Look. The pool actually worked. Why did people swim in clothes? Look at Mommy, she's so pretty. Yes. And Grandmother Josefa. And this lady here is Grandmother's mother. Our great grandmother. Remember Mom told us about her Granny Teresa? I'd never seen a photo of her. Luna, precious. You look better. And you, mamita you learned a very important lesson today. Good night, girls. "Domi!" Luna. Luna! Get up, we have to leave right now. It's too early, Nala. Please, Luna. Let's go. Nala, let me sleep. I don't feel well. - We have to go! - I don't want to, please. Please, Luna. I'll carry you. Here. Let's go, I'll help you. Let's go. Luna. Grandmother told us not to go far, what are you doing? What she says doesn't matter. What is this? Come, follow me. We're too far. I want to go back to the house, I'm scared. Abigail's cabin! She invited us for corn pudding. Come on. Luna. I feel really sick. Luna, we're almost there. I need you to get up. I want my bed. Please, Luna, make your last effort. I can't carry you over. Please, I need you to help me. Careful. Stay here, okay? I'll go get Abigail. Help! Abigail, help! Abigail? Abigail? Luna! Luna, I'm here! Luna! Oh, mamita. What did you do to your sister this time? Bring me a syringe that's on the kitchen counter now! Calm down, little one. It's all right. Let's turn her over. There, little one. You almost killed her! It's your fault! I know what you do to Luna at night! I saw you! Abigail's stories have driven you mad, mamita. I know everything! I know you're a witch! I know you suck Luna's blood. We're leaving here now. You think you decide when you can go? Your parents left me in charge! Luna is my blood! I won't allow you to keep hurting her. Open this door, damn witch! Nala? Pedro? Pedro! Pedro, get me out of here please! I was asked to come and check on you. - By grandmother? - No, Abi. She wants to know if you're okay. No, no. The two of you are witches. - I saw you. - What? What are you talking about, Nala? Yes! I saw you and Abigail... this morning, with the knife. You're helping my grandmother kill Luna! Listen to yourself. Who put those crazy ideas in your head? But... If you're not helping her please help me. Get me out of here! Please! No, I can't do that. I'll get in trouble with the boss. I have to take care of Luna. I can keep an eye on Luna for your peace of mind. Please don't let anything happen to her. - I have to go. - Pedro, please don't go! Pedro? Nala! I need you to come here, mamita. There was a terrible accident. Luna? In the pool. Pedro. Such a tragedy. To die so young, and all because of you! Why because of me? You asked him to clean the pool. That's why he tripped, hit his head and drowned. Where's Luna?! She's peacefully asleep in her room. - I have to see her! - Yes. But first we must talk to the police, they will be here any minute. Pedrito was like a son to me. Such a horrible accident. - Has his widow been notified? - You mean Abigail? As far as I know they got married two days ago. It wasn't an accident! She killed him! She's a witch! She sucks my sister's blood at night. Pedro tried to help us so she killed him. Please forgive my granddaughter. She's very upset. Because she's the one who made Pedrito clean the pool... Well, we'll leave you to your family matters. Good night. Let's go. No! Please don't go! Don't go! Please don't go, please! If you don't help us my sister will die. Oh, mamita! I think you have a serious learning disability. Do you want to see your sister? Look. Just look how you left your little sister after what you did to her. Luna, Luna. What are you doing?! What is this? It's a blood sample, your mom asked me to take it. This isn't a blood sample! When are you going to stop blaming me for everything? Nala? Yes. It's me. You'll be all right. Nala! Hello, hello? Nala. Darling, we have a bad signal. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, Grandmother is a witch! Honey... hear me? Nala. This is Mom. How are you, dear? How's your sister? Mom? Oh, mamita. You're going to give your mom a heart attack. She's doing something very important for Luna's health. I know what you're up to. It seems there's only way to get through to you. - Move. - Let go of me! Are you going to use those? Nala! You hit Grandmother! We have to get out of here! - Where? - Hurry! Are we going to leave Grandmother there? - Let's go. - I'm not going with you! Let's go. Let's go, Luna, come on. What is this? Wait here. We need help. Abigail? Abigail! Abigail! Abigail! Abigail? Pedro! Luna. Luna! No, no. Luna! No! Luna, please. Please, forgive me. Stay with me. Please. Luna? How are you, how do you feel? Strange. Like I just woke up. Nala! Luna! Luna. - Nala. - Nala! Nala, are you all right? - Luna. - Luna. Hello, mamita. "Jele." How is she? - Has she said anything? - Not a word. She's exhausted, dehydrated. But she'll be all right. - Trust me. - That's enough, Rebecca. I'm glad Luna is all right, but we're leaving right now. If she's not awake by the time I come back up we'll go directly to a hospital. Sorry, Josefa. Thanks for the hospitality, but we have to go. I understand, Guillermo. She almost killed Luna. How dare she take her out in the middle of the night like that? Don't blame her. She's in mid adolescence. Have you forgotten what you and I used to do when we were her age? Although I don't condone what you did for Luna, I'm glad it worked. Look. Look, she's fine. I don't know how to thank you, Josefa. I'm satisfied with seeing my family healthy. I can't believe she attacked you, I'm so sorry. She's just a girl. She's in a difficult stage of life. She's jealous, confused. Josefa. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you... for giving me a family again. Oh, mamita. Listen to me carefully. I will never leave Luna, not even over my dead body. Everything's ready. I'll bring Nala down and say goodbye to your mom. Darling. Honey, what is it? If I'm not back in five minutes fetch Nala and go away. And don't let Luna out of your sight. Josefa! Josefa! What have you done?! Sometimes plans change. You took my mother from me, now I will keep your daughters! There's... an epidemic in the building where you live? Kids are constantly sick. But Mom says they're not as sick as I am. Witches suck children's blood in order to steal their youth. When it became known in the village that the triplets had turned to witchcraft they disappeared, never to be seen again. It is believed that the sick triplet grew old and died. Of the other two, the one who decided to stay away from witchcraft also started to grow old while the other one ran away and remained young forever, sucking the blood of children every night. Honey. Are you feeling better? Take that look off your face. I know it's been hard for you, but you've done very well. In a few weeks Grandmother will move in with us. The poor thing is so alone out here, don't you think? We're leaving. We'll wait for you in the car. Okay? I was getting nervous. What happened? Where's Nala? She woke up. She's perfectly fine. As insufferable as always. She's saying goodbye to her grandmother. Darling, how are you feeling? You're wearing the dress. I know how painful goodbyes can be. But everything is going to be fine. What's this? There. Now you're perfect. Let's go. What are you staring at? Yes! Darling. I wanted to monitor her a few days just to be sure, but there's no trace of any symptom. We are over this crisis. I've never believed in miracles but I have no way of explaining this. The important thing is that she's well. Doctor, what about... Nala? As you know, I've checked her several times this week, and I can't find anything physical or neurological. She hasn't said a word in four days. Is that normal? I know several psychologists I can refer you to... Love, that's enough. She's going to be fine. She'll get over it. Trust me. Like I said, I'd never seen a recovery like hers. I don't understand how she got well. It's a miracle, Doctor. The adult world is complicated and fantastic. I know you think you know a lot of things. Today, when you enter womanhood, is the day you will truly begin to learn... mamita. What could be worse than killing your own mother without even knowing? That was the price that the Bacá demanded in exchange of saving Luna. Legend has it that the witch's curse was fulfilled and the two sisters who killed her got their punishment. They would live through the blood of others only to fall by their own blood, one by one, teaching their traditions to the new generations provided that they were ready to learn.
