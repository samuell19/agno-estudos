- If you stop me now, I won't be able to do the restore. My life's work. - Nobody works here you see. I mean I'm Mr. Brooks, but nobody works here anymore. I don't... Well okay. Unbelievable. Guy says he works here. - That's good. - No that's not good. - This is so odd. - Okay I'll bite, what is it? - Okay so you know how toy makers were a specialty profession, kind of like a butcher, et cetera, so on and so forth right? Well each customer in this book represents a ledger like a checklist of each toy made. Empty. - Maybe he just didn't get around to it. It's not that hard to figure out. Or maybe it got lost amongst the rest of the crap over here. - Yeah, all great theories, except he wasn't making different toys. It's the same toy. - Monteya, come on. Come on be careful, what are you doing? Come on now didn't I tell you to be careful with what you touch? Ow. Huh. Finally something works. Whoever can use that... Whoever accepts this gift will be the soul of its contents. "You are part of a wild hunt." Any attempt to interrupt the nature "of its intent will lead to end." "Be warned that it sees all and punishes. You are granted removal of one name from this... naughty list." - Hey. - Wait I thought you said you were at a toy shop which is kind of pedophile-ish but I didn't want to judge. - Sky, why are you calling me? I told you to wait for my call. - Wait are you in any trouble? Because if you need me there before Christmas just let me know. - Wait, where is Nick again? - Nick is in the back, and what I really, really need is for you to not know so much about the big surprise. - Why not? - Because you have a big mouth. - Okay, so that's how this is gonna go? Where's Nick? - He's in the back. - So, he's in the back, by himself? - Yeah. - You must really hate your boyfriend, huh? - Uh, fianc√© and what why? - You're letting him touch all this old and creepy shit without a gun or a priest or a shaman, nothing? Now you know what, hey send me the address where you're gonna have this little party. I'm gonna have my cousin Yelp it. - Sky the party is on Christmas and you know how Nick feels about that time of year. - Wait so you invited the entire neighborhood or? - Yeah, yeah I invited a few people. - Yeah that's some really crazy shit right there. Having a bunch of random people over. - Yeah, if you, if you could see this place you would know that that's not gonna be an issue. - That's racist. - No, no what I'm saying is that this place is literally stuck in the 30's. - You realize that's still racist right? - Okay what I mean is that there's no one here under the age of 90, I mean, there's no traffic, no birds, there's no kids. - Hey, wait, what's going on? - I'm okay. - Hey have you seen The Village? - I gotta go. I'll call you later. - Okay whatever. I'll remember that. - "I accept this gift from Woo-Don." I guess it was the last thing he made, but the whole thing was odd. I'm not even sure I saw whatever it was. I'm just happy for it to be appraised and then we can move on with our lives... - Do you want to marry me? - What? - You heard what I said. Do you want to marry me? - Of course. - Well you know what this holiday means to me. - Yes, and I'm trying. - Look, we've spent the majority of our time celebrating an old shop. I mean we hardly even talk. I feel like I know nothing about your life here, the people, the town. - I've never kept anything from you, Victoria. - Why can't we meet your mom? - She uh... I've already told you why. - Well I want to know again, tell me again. I'm serious, if we're gonna get married then I need to meet at least one person in your family, a cousin, an uncle, anyone. What are you doing, why are we stopping? - Sir, hey. Are you okay? Sir, you've been in an accident, is there anyone you want me to call? - I'm going to get into so much trouble. - Sir, you're gonna be-sir, who's going to be mad at you? - Hey. Nick? - Let's get to the house. - Okay let's just not talk about it. Listen. Christmas music. I better go and turn that right off. - Really? - I think I'm gonna make some hot chocolate but don't worry I wouldn't even dream of putting marshmallows in it. - Honey. - I'll be fine just not right now okay? - Victoria. - Oh my god. What? Are you serious? Is this a joke? Whatever. Nice try and all, but, this is not what I meant by Christmas spirit. That thing is creepy as shit by the way. Okay, I get that it's weird but it is not that much of a big deal. What's up with you? - I didn't bring it. - Yeah. Why does it have that creepy blade? So, I'm assuming you found it like that? - Yeah but, it ran. - It ran? - Yeah and it marked me with a seal. - A seal? - And it's right here on my left arm. - Yeah. Damn, I hate it when that happens. When I was young my Sally See and Say spoke without me pulling her cord. You know what I did? I chucked it. Bye you creepy son of a bitch. - Oh. Done. No more trouble from Santa's creepy little helper. - What'd you do with him? - It is in the trash. - Okay. I'm gonna take a shower, and uh, I might crash. - Well we stayed at my house and why is that even weird? How man guys know where you live? - That's a fair point. But wait so you're in the middle of nowhere with a guy who's having killing your ass flashbacks. - No no no they're not flashbacks they're night terrors. - Night terrors my ass, have you seen Amityville Horror? - No, what's that? - It's what you're living right now. Look girl there is so many new dating apps right now. I say you call it all off and you come back home before you get chopped up into little baby pieces in your sleep. - Listen he's not crazy, I mean, yeah okay, he's got issues. - This is all my fault. I should have let you use my account so you could stream more movies... - Okay listen there's one more thing. There was this really creepy elf waiting on us when we got home. - Like real elf? - No it's dumb. - Ah so he's into elves. - Never mind, never mind. Look it's Christmas Eve and the 'rents are gonna be here any second so I love you. - Alright alright I love you too. But as your friend I'm obligated to say this-run. - Bye. Hey, hey, Hey, you're ok. Hey, hey it's okay, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. It's okay, it's okay, come here. - That's it. - Nick what just happened in there? - Just pack up whatever you got and let's go. Don't just stand there, let's go, let's move. - Nick it's Christmas Eve. And there's a major snow storm heading this way. - Okay, there cannot be. - Yeah all flights are being canceled. - Shit. - Nick. Wait, wait, Nick, Nick, wait. - Surprise. - Well say something, son. - Speechless? - John. Speechless. - We spoke about this. - Yes, yes we did. - So, as a family we are so excited to celebrate one of many and just thrilled to be here. - Well it's a party isn't it? Special, all the way from Greenland. To the man of the house. - Excuse me. What? - Here, it's okay Dad just... - Oh boy. - Hey. - I just wanna... - Surprise? - You just couldn't resist could you? - Oh come on that's not fair. - You knew how much this shit meant to me. - Yeah but you know how much family means to me. Look it's Christmas Eve and my family and my parents are right out there and I even invited some people from the town. - You did what? - Yeah, from the place that you grew up in. - Born, I didn't grow up here. - Okay, whatever. - And I told you the only thing that I want to do is I want to appraise this place and get the fuck out of here. - You actually haven't told me much of anything. I don't know a thing about you. - Well I for one never cared much about the buzz during this time of year. - Pops where you going? - Going to get my own special bottle and it ain't from no damn Greenland either. Come on, Martha. - Ma. - I like his take on that. - Ma. Dad there's a storm coming. - Screw it, god damn. - I guess maybe three months is a little fast. Even for us. - It's Christmas Eve. My family and friends are out there, so. - I don't think it is safe to drive. - Then why did you come? - Because you are as blind as a bat, that's why. - Which explains 50 plus years no doubt. God it is freezing. - Well if you had worn what I put out for you... - Wait a second. Do you hear that, hmm? Silence. - This close, you are this close. - What the hell is this? - What is this? - I just said that. - What is this doing in our car? - Funny lookin' thing isn't it? - Can you believe him? - You know how he is. He hasn't been the same ever since. Anyways. So... three months. - Oh my god. - Starting to understand the idea of cold feet. I don't know. Do you think I'm making a mistake? - Oh hey, it's not for me to say. Only you know what's good for you. - Earlier, we were at the shop which by the way is this whole other story, and I was looking out the window and there was, this old man shoveling snow. - Okay and? - And there was no snow. Then we get home and Nick has this... little elf thing propped up, waiting on us. It's the creepiest thing that I've ever seen in my life. And if you know Nick, you know that that just makes no sense at all. - Right, and what does that mean? - Nick... he hates Christmas, absolutely loathes it because he had an incident when he was younger where... Let's just say the last thing that Nick would ever do is touch anything and I mean anything Christmas related. - Okay so why do you think that he did it? - I guess, I guess he's having second feelings about the wedding and him acting out of character is his way of showing me that. - Okay, big sister card. I think that you've had way, way too much of this Greenland eggnog. - That stuff was gross. - Yeah that's why nobody goes to Greenland, honey. - Tiffany you seen Papa? - I thought they came back? - Well they should've been back by now. You know maybe I should go and try to find them. - No. No you're gonna stay right here, and you're gonna make things right. - Yeah, uh, I'll go find them. - Yes. - Yeah with the storm coming in we're gonna need some supplies anyways, right? - Yes, that's a great idea. - You know what I'll go with him. - Dad hates the cold. He's probably out playing hooky somewhere. - Nana, Papa! I don't know why they would've traveled this far. - So you see things Nick? - Nana! - Hey man I get it. We've all been through some shit, kind of changes your perspective of things. - Yeah well it's a good thing there are people I pay to talk about those things. - I'm sorry. - Papa! - I guess Victoria didn't tell you I'm an actual psychologist. - Nana! Papa! - But in your case... a god damn psychiatrist. See, Mr. Conway wanted me to give you a message. It wasn't hard, I've had you pegged ever since the first time I laid eyes on you. I mean who knows? You might've been bullied, you might've been touched. Could've been batshit crazy. But either way, you're gonna tell Victoria that you can't do this. "Hey it's too much, I'm too coo-coo." Believe me, she'll understand. - Okay. Pretty long walk. Someone could get lost. - I always knew you'd settle down in a nice quiet little town. - Dad this was supposed to be an introduction, a chance for us to all meet and spend Christmas together... - What so we could meet the guy you decided to marry without consulting us or telling anyone? - Consulting? - You're cooped up in this house doing what you clearly don't want to do. Do you have any interest in this family whatsoever? - Family? That is rich coming from you. Tell me is this everyone or are we waiting on someone? - That's enough. - Come on, Dad. Let's all hear it, how's our brother nowadays? Have you heard from him lately? - I said that's enough. - Oh why don't we go and ask his mom? Remember the one you sent away? - John. - I know honey. You're mad at me, and that's okay, I probably deserve it, but that's no reason to throw your life away. - I am not. - And what's sad is you don't even see it. Look around you, there's no photos of a life before this moment. - John. - No artwork, no paintings... - John. - No plans, no memories... - John. John! - Don't you find that a little odd? He told you that he killed his father when he was nine right? Or that he stabbed his mother in the face over and over again? And now she's sitting in a psych ward in Bristol. You know it's amazing what you can find out if you do a little research. Christmas Eve Massacre, or that's what the papers called it, house of murdered guests donned in their finest silks. - Honey, we just didn't know how to tell you all of this. - If I'm guilty, I'm guilty of trying to protect my little girl. - Oh. - Guys, everybody. We... we are in danger. - Calm down, it's okay. - No wait, what, no listen. There's a killer out there, and we have to leave now. - Nick, where's Jeremiah? - Oh yeah. We were walking and then he attacked me. I.. He... He was... he was attacked by this... this little-this this little thing! This... Okay. - This elf thing! - Okay, all right, calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down, are you listening? We have to go! - Hey, I'm sorry I didn't notice, I'm sorry. - You remember, you remember the imp, the little elf thing. - You mean this elf? - Yeah, but he was... - I know it's not easy, son. - Hey, hey listen I'm gonna support you through this, okay? We're in this together, but right now I just need to make sure that you don't hurt anybody else. - You... you told him to attack me. - You told him to attack me. Why would you do that? - Let's go upstairs and get ready and as soon as the storm passes we're gonna get you the help that you need. Nick, baby, upstairs. - We're all here for you, son. - Let's just go upstairs and... - We're all here for you. - Baby let's just go upstairs, come on. - What about Jeremiah? Dad? - I'll go look for Jeremiah. He probably just got lost following Nick back to the house. Hon, can you give me my coat please? That's probably Jeremiah now. Hon, if Nana and Papa get here before me make sure they stay, okay? ‚ô™ Sayeth Christ and say his name ‚ô™ He's the light, the joy within ‚ô™ Be the light, the joy within - What's going on? - Hey, excuse me. ‚ô™ Let your... Excuse me! Well that's great and all, but, I need to go look for my son-in-law, and I don't have time for this, but thanks for the offer. - No wait. You see, we traveled a very long distance to be here. And it would really warm my heart if you let us sing one more song. ‚ô™ We wish you peace and joy - What? ‚ô™ We wish you peace and joy within ‚ô™ We wish you peace Oh my god! - What's going on? - Rolling blackout? I guess caused by the storm. That's weird. - John, what happened? - I don't know. Everybody just calm down okay? - We need to call somebody. - There's nobody to call, there's no service. Just calm down okay. - What was that? - What the hell? - What is it? - It's-it's nothing, it's nobody. Tiffany let me see that light. Tiffany give me the damn light. - Dad. - I'm gonna go check on the breaker box. Yell if the lights come on. Check on your sister. - Just be careful out there. - What is that? - It's what I've been trying to show you. - Is this from the... that thing? - When I was young, they used to tell me about him. My grandfather. The keeper of children's souls. The uh-townspeople they were... so afraid of him that they created a curfew, and uh, anyone that was caught after dawn was... The story goes that... a wild hunt was initiated by supernatural creatures, led by an evil demagogue. And their main objective is to take souls. Our souls. And bring them down into... the underworld... for sport. And if you... if you saw them, they-you're cursed. Unless you bargained to help them. - Help-help them how? What is that? - I found this... inside the box with the elf. - I don't understand. Why are- why are some of the names scratched out? - I think my grandfather decided to help them by sealing the souls of little kids inside of a wooden box. And they gifted him with something that would help him do it. - Sweet Christmas. - Gah! - Who is there? Perfect. - What? - Dad? - John, what happened to you? - Jeremiah... he's-in the snow man. - Did you find him? - John, what happened to you? - John, what happened to you? - Somebody... He knows. The thing, the elf, he... - It's Mom. - Get away from the door. - Tiffany! - It won't lift. - It's stuck. - How do we get rid of it? Nick, what do we do? - I don't know, okay? - Dad. Stay with me, stay with me. Don't speak, don't speak just save your energy, ok? - We need more bandages or... - Upstairs, I'll go get 'em. - No, don't you move. You have already done enough. - Mrs. Conway. - Don't, don't move. - Dad I just... Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad, stay with me. Dad. - This bitch has not answered any of my... - Hi, can I take your order? - One second please. Come on V. - I'm waiting, can I take your order? - Bitch I said hold on, damn. - Who is this? - Um, this is Sky and who is this? - Sky? Um.. Listen... there's a fucking killer on the loose at the Brooks' residence. - Wait, what? Okay, um... what does he look like? - One foot... about one foot two inches. Sky, listen, don't let the son of a bitch leave this house. - Did she just... hello? Killer on the loose? Hello! Killer on the loose! I knew that motherfucker... Amityville Horror. What did I say? - Where'd you go? - Another name has been etched off. - Let me see that. Was there anything else, something with it? - I, no I don't think so. - It's a yes or it's a no. - I... - It said something about having the ability to erase one of the names. - What does that mean? - I don't know... the... the photo book, the toy maker list, the... - What about them? - If this is a naughty list and it is compiled for all the names that were chosen for a wild hunt, shit. - What? - The reason the, the reason why the toy maker's ledger is empty is because he never finished. All the people in Blakeley, they're the children of the town. - Wait. You think... You think that this wild hunt is here to finish off the townspeople? - No, their... descendants. To finish the cycle. Their minds got old... No, their minds never changed, but their bodies got old. That is why the old man in the car was acting so weird. - Okay what, what, if what you're saying is true then... your grandfather must not have finished the list, which, that means that... You're next. - And if we don't... finish, - Then the hunt continues. Unless... There's two names here. Oh shit, Mom. Mom? Mom? What is that? Mom? Nick. Nick. Nick. Are you seeing this, Nick? Nick. Nick. - Hey, hey. Nick. Let's get out of here. We have to go. Get away! What do you want from me? Somebody help me! Nick! Nick? Nick? - Kill it! Kill that motherfucking piece of shit, kill it! It's dead. - You okay? - Yeah. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Walk. Walk. - Is it dead, is it dead? Nick, what the fuck? I can't open it, I just need a bit more... Nick help me. Just a little bit more, I'm gonna... - What's that? That emblem? - What do you mean, honey? - How did your parents know how to find this place? - Because you aren't the only one who survived this curse. Nothing personal my love, it's just only one name can be erased. Hey! Listen! Where's the list? Stay with me, where's the list? Baby, baby. Do you think this is funny? - Sort of. - No! No! Baby! Baby. Don't, no. Merry Christmas. - These damn roads, they had me circling round and round for like hours and then out of nowhere it just cleared up. I got you something, it's a little cheap, but I knew it was something you would like. Kind of weird, huh? It's a little creepy but... Merry Christmas.
