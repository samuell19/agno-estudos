Some hide fearful behind a veil of fearlessness. Others relish in the light of their true spiritual makeup. But in the end, no matter what mask you put on, underneath it the reveal will always be the same, for we are all made up of flesh, bone, blood, and stardust, just trying to escape, to free ourselves from confinement, from control of our own making. We try to exist behind the pain until we are forced to confront it. And for me, that day has come. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Jack. So the rehearsal dinner's on Friday at seven. Make sure you get to the hotel on time. Uh-huh. Oh, and your brother rented out both penthouses for the wedding party. Of course he did. How's that little story coming? Well, actually my boss... And don't miss your flight out of Detroit. What? Dad, no, I told you I'm on assignment in the U.P. Where? It's... up north. Look, I gotta go, but I'll see you on Friday. Ow! - Hey, Emma. - Hey, Gracie. Can I have a "Spotlight"? Sure can. Have a good day. Hey, do you know where I can get an... No. What I was going to ask you, before you interrupted me, was do you know where I can get a charger? No, we don't sell them. What about all those? No. Seriously? They're not chargers. It's a charger. They're not available. Why? They're mine, I'm sorry. They're yours? They're for dildos. Okay, what do I have to do to get one of those? Ah, screw it. Got it. Crap. Hey, Greg. Jackie boy. How's the new... What the hell is that sound? No, nothing, Greg. It's just this damn, nothing. What's up? I wanted to check in and make sure you're liking your new digs. Yeah, no, they're great. You know, apart from the Cold War era stove, everything's good. I mean, the townspeople are idiots, but. Great, great, glad to hear it. Hey listen, this is an easy story, Jackie. Small town closes open mines, identity crisis, tighter regulations, environmental lawsuits, and a pivot toward cleaner, cheaper burning natural gas, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yes, Greg, I will get you a story. And don't go off the grid this time. Every time you go on location, I can't get a hold of you. If I call you and you don't pick up that phone, I'm gonna fire you. You'll be finished quicker than a teenage kid on prom night, you got it? Yeah, yeah Greg, I got it. You think you can just go out and become a famous writer? You didn't even finish undergrad. Look, you're not a writer, Jack. Explain to me why I now have to retract your article? I just forgot to give him co-writing credit. It's not a big deal. Real writers, their words reverberate off the page. Yours? They barely ripple. Go to sleep! Woo! Way to go, Jack. Good pump. Hey. Oh. Hey. What you doin'? I'm just shopping. I'm Emma, Emma Ellis, rhymes with overzealous if that helps. Hey, your mile sweat time's a little slow. I'm sorry? 9:30, that's not good. I'm sorry, I'm confused. Were you following me? So you're from New York, huh? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm new in town. Oh, I know. Everybody knows. So what are you doing here? Ooh, let me guess. You are, you're running from the law. No, no, no, no, you are searching for your daughter with a special set of skills? No. Oh. I am a journalist. You're a writer? I'm a writer too. I mean, I'm not a journalist. You're probably like a fancy writer guy. I'm just like a regular writer. Hey, who do you write for? The Green Bay Post? No, New York Times. Oh. Yeah. Cool. Mm-hm, I'm actually writing a story on the town. Oh I can help. I can totally help. I can introduce you to people and show you around town because I always say you have to plan your work and then you work your plan, and I can be a part of that plan because if I'm not a part of that plan you might go to the wrong people. And if you're not talking to the right people you're talking to the wrong people. And if you're talking to the wrong people then you're not talking to the right people. And you can't write your paper if you're talking to the wrong people, 'cause the right people are the people you're gonna need to talk to your people about. You know, about your paper. Yeah. No, that sounds great. But I actually work alone, so thank you, but no thank you. But no one's gonna talk to you. Why? They don't like you. Well, they don't know me, plus, I'm a professional journalist so I've done this, but thank you for the offer. What can I do for you today? I'm just wondering if I can ask you some questions. Excuse me sir, I was wondering if you might have a few minutes to answer some questions about the open mines? Excuse me sir, I was wondering if you had a moment to talk about how the change towards green energy has affected the infrastructure and jobs in town? Particularly regarding the mines closing down. No time. Is that a rifle? Okay, so when the lifeblood of the town was suddenly drained to feed the bureaucratic and capitalistic vampires, that made you feel how? What are you talking about? You don't know how to cut wood or split wood. No. You know how to burn wood? Never started a... Never started a fire huh buzz? Yeah. Okay. Have a nice day. Okay, those were $150. What ya doing up there Mr. Giggles? God, you're so high. How'd you get up? Ooh, oh jump! Jump, jump, jump! You can do it Mr. Giggles! Go! Go. Wow! Nice job Mr. Giggles. Who ya talking to? Mr. Giggles is a squirrel. He's usually very brave, but right now he's being a little baby! Okay. Well, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you and Mr. Giggles. I'll leave you two. How's interviews coming Mr. Professional? Ah, I will have you know that they are going very well. Nobody will talk to you, huh? No, some won't even look at me. Well you're not from here. I mean, neither am I, but I've lived here pretty much my whole life so I get a pass, but you have only been here for a day so you don't get a pass. You get no trust. You mean mistrust. See. That, what you just did there. Thinking you're better. I don't think that I'm better. Mm-hm! I don't! Look, um, you mentioned that you might be able to... Do you think that you could... Do you think you could help me with my interviews? Ooh, I don't know. Mr. Giggles and I had some pretty big plans tonight. So, I'm not a ditcher. Please? Okay I'll do it. Great. But, I'll show you around town, introduce you to everyone. Make sure people don't think you're a weirdo and a lemon-head, if you teach me how to be a professional jourmalist. And I mean like a professional journalist. You know what, just forget I ever mentioned anything. Oh okay. Okay, well if you don't wanna finish your article, you know, plant potatoes, get potatoes. Fine. Fine, I'll do it. Okay great, you wanna start now? Right now? Yeah, come on. Okay. Can you pick a side? You pick a side. I've already been here. It'll be fine. - Hey Larry. - Hey. This is my friend Jack. Do you mind if we comes in and ask you some questions about the closing of Open Mines? Sure, come on in! Look at that. - Show him! - Maybe! - Hey! - That's the club. - Oh wow. - 1892. Probably September or something. Yes, September 1st 1892, the Loretto Mine Club. And so your dad worked in the mine? Well, yes, when he was single. When he was single? Mh-hmm. And the sad part about that story is the mines shut down and the people took off and... They took a beating at that time. They took a beating. Boyfriend? No! You're not pregnant are ya? Jimmy! So I said, "I think we had a good life," and... and... here we are. So could you tell me a little bit about what the mine meant to the community? I can tell you about the Green Bay Packers. If you want. Um... Don't bother, he's the quiet type. You wanna head inside? That's Jack, he works for the newspaper. He's kind of weird, but it's okay to help him. Emma, you coming? Thank you so much for all of your help today. I mean, I got some really great stuff. No problem goblin. So, when do you think we can my first writing lesson? I write every day so I'm not bad, but I feel like I don't know some things, you know? Mm-hm. Also, my legs are made out of spaghetti. Wow. And once I turned myself into a coffee table just to know what it felt like to hold magazines. Cool. - When can I have my first - Hey!

Could you? Of course. That'd be amazing. Okay. So how you liking Veronica's cottage? Who's Veronica? Oh she's my best friend. We always go swimming in the lake. Oh, cool. Is Ms. Adeline her grandmother? She's the woman I'm renting from. Yeah. Oh my God! Why would you do that! Ooh, I gotta be home in 15 minutes. It takes me 18 minutes to walk so I'd better run. I guess I could just take you back to my place and we can take a ride from there. I can't get in a car with strangers you nut job. But it's okay, I can run, I'm fast. You sure? Mh-hmm. Okay. You wanna come? To your place? Yeah. No, I can't. Can't run in $200 jeans, so. Those jeans are $200! Yeah. They're Rag and Bone. Are you scared I'm gonna beat you? I mean I'll go easy on you, I promise. No, no, I'm not worried about that okay. They called me the Speed Demon in high school, so I am pretty fast. Okay 9:30, let's do it. Oh, you wanna go? Yeah. Okay, all right. I don't even know where we're going and I'm still gonna beat you. Ready? Set. Don't take a digger! Woo I won! Hey Champ! That's my friend Jack, he works for the New York Times. Oh and he's staying for dinner. Hey, Jack Cohen. Emma! Great. It was really good. So, Champ was in the Army. He was the guy who jumped out of planes. Oh wow, that's really impressive man. Thank you so much for your service. Yeah, I actually had a couple friends in the Navy and one of them told me that... That the Navy are a bunch of fags? Is that what he said? No, no, no, but you know, just forget about it. It's cool. Sorry. You should ask Champ about your article, he could definitely help you. Couldn't he, Champ? Oh, wow yeah man. That would be awesome. Yeah no, I don't trust newspapers. Or not. I don't trust any media to be honest. You know, they're always trying to sell me on some stuff. They got this stench. Like they're better. You know, like they're nine feet tall, like looking down at ya. Same way I feel about those people coming here and buying houses on our lakes. 'Cause they think we're stupid, right? But you know what's funny is, is you city bitches, you take happy pills and stare at screens all day like a bunch of freaking zombies you know, and we're stupid. See, if you ask me, from where I'm sitting, you know, you city bitches are the stupid ones. Yeah. It's very well articulated, man. Hey, we should do a bonfire. Ooh, yeah, it'd be so much fun. We can do it right, Champ? And Jack, you'll stay right? Oh it's cold outside, you can borrow one of Champ's jackets, it'll be great. That's fine right? Yeah, yeah we can have a bonfire. Great. And you'll stay won't you? Um... You gotta stay man. She wants you to stay. Yeah, yeah sure, I can stay for a few minutes. Or like an hour. Or he can stay for a few minutes. Or like an hour. Time for a bonfire. So, are you Champs girlfriend? Why did he say that? No, no, no I was just assuming 'cause... What'd he say? Tell me. Nothing. I'm just guessing 'cause you're here and he's here and no one else is. Listen. That man is the man of my dreams. And he doesn't know it yet, but we're gonna get married one day. So if he said something, you better tell me. Don't mess with me. No, no, no, he didn't say anything. Neither did I. Cool. Oh you think that's funny city boy? Why don't you give it a try? Nah, I'm good man, thanks. I'm more of a stare at the fire type of guy. Come on, don't be a pussy. Yeah, don't be a pussy. You're not gonna ruin your hair. Come on. All right. Let's do it. There you go, there you go. Jack: Jesus Christ! Ooh you're okay? Sorry man, you know, that one just got away from me. Why do you have to be such a jerk Champ? Awe he's fine, he's fine, you know.

Yup, yup, yup, yup, that's exactly right. You know, no one's ever done it. Plenty of people tried, but you know, you'd be the first. I'd be the first? Uh-huh. Numero uno That's Spanish. Es español I don't know if I can do it man. Oh you got it, you got it, you got it. Michael Phelps this. You're gonna... Michael Phelps this! Drink! Screw it, let's do it! Yeah! Emma! I'm gonna do it! You're gonna do it! I'm gonna do it! There ya go, you just drank all my freaking Vodka. All right. Woo! Yeah! Oh my God, there's something touching my leg! Oh it's driftwood! I hate driftwood! You're so stupid! Good morning, good morning, are you awake? Are you awake? Good morning, good morning Jack. Good morning, are you awake? Are you awake? Ah, good morning! I made some breakfast, do you want breakfast? I made blueberry pancakes. Champ likes blueberry pancakes, I don't really like blueberry pancakes, but I just take the blueberries out and save them for the birds. Where are my clothes? Do you like blueberries? What? I don't. What? Are we gonna have our writing lesson or? No. You promised. You said if I helped with interviews I would get a writing lesson. Okay fine. Let me go back. I'm gonna go get some clothes on and take a shower and get my dignity back. And then I'll come over. Okay great, I'll see you then! Hi! Hey. Ooh, I see you found some clothes. Yeah. I think Champ might've gotten mine. Yeah, probably. Or a shark got 'em. There's sharks in the water? Well there aren't supposed to be, but about 100 years ago, this guy got sharks for pets and then he realized he couldn't take care of 'em so he put 'em in the water and then they had babies, and now we have sharks. Cool, that makes me feel really good. Pretty weird right? Yeah, no, it's awesome. Ooh, I brought you this. What are these? They're my stories. There's a lot of them. Yeah, I write a new story on a new person every week. Fascinating. I will read them later. Or now. Or later. Or maybe right now. I'm way too hungover for this. Yeah, but you got a lot of time so maybe you can just read them right now. Hangovers don't care about time. I don't care about hangovers. I do. Well... We'll start writing. Okay. Got that, now what? Now you write. You put pen to paper and you just write. Just gotta write, that's what you're giving me? It's what I got. There are your clothes Michael Phelps. Thanks man.

I don't really know what's going on with you and Emma, but I don't really like it. You don't know anything about anything around here, so, you know, do yourself a favor and stay away from her. Know your place Jack. Write your little article and go home. Don't go shaking stuff that doesn't need to be shook. You know? And before you go, you should probably go grab the American flag, you know? Be the first. Have a good day, Jack. Okay, now what? You know what, I forgot, I gotta... I gotta go. What? Why? Yeah, no, sorry. The office texted me, duty calls you know. Yeah. Okay well, if you change your mind I'll be at the Long Branch for lunch. I gotta go. Hey Greg, got all the research done early. It's gonna be a great article. Might be my best work yet. Gonna write up a draft tonight and head back tomorrow. See ya then. Good news! Your brother said his boss is looking for a new coordinator. Winky face emoji. Dad, I have a job. Journalism is a dying field. This is a real opportunity. Jesus Christ, I get it. Get off my ass already. Sure. We'll see. Champ's good, you know how he is. But, I don't know. I worry about him, but... he's an adult. See you guys tomorrow. So how ya liking Veronica's cottage? Who's Veronica? Oh she's my best friend. We always go swimming in the lake. Frank and Shelly Ellis are survived by their two children, Emma and Champ. Weekly Spotlight by Emma Ellis. So you wanna work here. What are you willing to do to get the story? Honestly, anything. Lie? Manipulate? With a smile on my face. Hey cashews for nuts, what's up? Hey Greg, look, I think I might have something for you. Well, that something better have to do with the story. Well, it's a story. Jesus, what are you talking about? Okay, I think I may have a story better than the iron mine. Here's the pitch. I met this girl and 10 years ago her parents and three best friends were killed in a shooting, right. And then... Why would that interest me? Why do I care about a story that happens every week in America? We've all been shot at. Most people don't know it because they haven't been hit. No Greg, the girl is here. And I feel like if I just really lean in, you know, squeeze out her take, get the human interest angle, there's something here. And there's some weird stuff also going on with her. She like talks to herself or whatever, but hey, you know the crazy ones. They always have the best stories. I think if I dig in man, I can make some waves with this story, I'm telling you. You think? What the hell is wrong with you? Why can't you just stick to the story? You know what? Just give me a story, but I swear, if it is not more spectacular than say an elephant that can spin a baton with it's dick, you're gonna be back grading papers for your asshole dad. How's that pitch? Is that pitch good?! That sounds fair. So on Monday I went to the store and Pat said that it was only 3.75 to get the candy, but then I went back the next day and it was on sale and I got it for 2.75. So I took the extra dollar and I'm gonna save it and probably try to buy... Who are you talking to? Oh hey! Hi. Take a seat. Okay. Oh you can't sit there, that's Tammy's seat. Okay, sorry. I didn't realize that we were meeting people here. Oh we're not. Oh then, are we early? Oh no, everybody's at bowling. Oh, okay, well, I'm here. I know. I mean I'd knew you'd come. It was pretty obvious. Why is it so obvious? Your face, it's sad. I mean, it's pretty clear that you're lonely and you have no friends. Oh. I always thought I had a pretty, you know, happy, have a lot of friends face. Oh no. Ready Emma? Hey Tina, oh I like your jacket. Where'd you get it? Oh some girl gave it to me. It fits you perfect. She was a small girl. Well, jean jackets are supposed to run small, so. - No. - Yeah. I don't think so. Pretty sure. It's not a thing. Read about it in GQ. Okay, the usual? Um. I will have the usual. Great. Oh, and by the way, the thing you wrote on Joe Tipper was so good. I had no idea he built the gazebo behind the church. He did. Yeah. What do you want newspaper? I will have the house salad. And then do you guys have like a balsamic vinaigrette? We have ranch. Oh no, I can't do ranch. Lactose issues. Gross. Get the ranch. Okay, but do you guys have like any other options? We have ranch. Okay. Yeah, yeah, sure. You know what, I'll have the ranch. I'll be fine. Uh-huh. See, happy face. Mm-hm. How's your salad? Oh my God, this is incredible. Better than your balsamic blah blah blue? Yeah, no, I mean like normally I don't have ranch because you know, stomach. But this is like made by the Gods. Did you get a lot of work done today? Yeah, some. So, you said you're not from here. Where are you from? I grew up in Detroit but my dad moved us up here when he became the union rep for the mine. Oh, cool. So your dad worked for the mine. You never mentioned that. Oh. Oh that's so bad, that's disgusting. I'm full, you? I just started. Yeah, I'm bored, let's do something fun. You know, I think three pins isn't bad. It's not bad. It's better than none. Thank you. How 'bout we play a game. Truth or Dare? One throw each. Whoever knocks down the least amount of pins has to choose. Yeah I'm in! Yeah? It's game time. Let's do it. All right. I don't wanna talk about it. Truth or dare? Dare. I dare you to let me ask you a question. That's not part of the game. Come on, it's the rules. Fine. Okay. What's your favorite color? Yellow. No, yellow. It looks good. Yeah, you're right. You're up! It's getting better. Truth. Where'd you get that scar on your hand? Oh. I jumped off a bridge when I was eight. My mom said that it was deep enough but it wasn't and I hit a rock. My turn. Not great. No. Truth. What does your mom do? She's a mom. That's it? She loves to garden. She can't spend enough time there. She always says that one lifetime isn't enough to accomplish ones horticultural goals. I mean, if a garden is the site for an imagination, how could we be very far from the beginning? You know? That was good. Thanks. Impressive. Okay, truth or dare? Truth. How do you know when you've got the best version of the story? Well, I guess it depends on what type of story you wanna tell. Come on, let's go! Are you sure we should be doing this? Don't be a baby baby. Ready, catch! Okay, so you've like never driven before? Nope, no one ever taught me. Not your parents, your brother? Definitely not my brother. He said I wouldn't wanna find out what would happen if he ever caught me driving. Exactly what I wanna hear right after we stole his truck. Not stole, we borrowed. Okay, and you're like sure that he's not coming back home tonight? No, beer o'clock. He's at Dales for the rest of the night. Okay, all right. So just turn the car on and ease into it. Okey dokey! Forward. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, - No, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. There you go. Slow. Slow. Slow. There we go. Good good. Now just stay steady and keep your eyes on the road. Yeah, duh. Not bad huh? No, I mean it's better than the parking lot. See, this is what writing's all about. You take risks and you try new things. Check and check. But then you have to escalate. Like if you're going sky diving, don't check the parachute. Go for it, be reckless. I mean, that's what all great writers are you know. Reckless. I can be reckless. Oh yeah? Emma, what are you doing? I'm being reckless. - Just let me know - Emma. If a deer comes in the middle of the road. - It'll be fine. - Emma open your eyes. - Open your eyes. - Just live a little baby! Emma seriously, open your eyes! - Don't be a baby - Emma seriously! It's fine! I do not feel like dying tonight, open your eyes! Oh my God. Oh come on, so much for not checking the parachute! It was... Forget it. You poop your pants a little bit? You okay? I'm fine, just tired. You ever think about just going to space and disappearing? Space? No. Spain yes. Why Spain? Gaudi. You know about Gaudi? Yeah, we do have libraries here, thank you very much. Sorry, that was dickish of me. Yes it was. So, tell me. Why Gaudi? Well his church. Ah, La Basilica de la Sagrada Familia. You know about it? I've been. What? Shut up! Yeah, I went a couple years back with my parents. It was incredible. So you know that he started building it late in his life, knowing that he wouldn't live to see it be completed? I mean, he died in 1926 and it was only like a quarter complete. But the people living there continued to build it. They were able to keep his vision alive. I don't know, I just think it's really beautiful because even after he died he was able to give these people meaning. Yeah, well, that's the dream right? To have a legacy, to be celebrated. Yeah, sure that's fine, but I don't know, legacies are reserved for like famous people and presidents. What about people like Tim or Vicky? Who's Tim and Vicky? Exactly. I mean, for me it's not about being celebrated, but it's about making sure that their stories are told. They deserved to have their stories told just as much as any stupid celebrity. I mean that's why I started writing the Weekly Spotlights. I want them to be able to live on the page forever. You know? I mean, I've written about every single person in town and they may not be famous but they are unique. And I think if people gave unique a chance they might like it. Well, I did. I read some of your stories. They were really good. Really? You're not just saying that? No, no, no, no. I mean honestly, you are a natural. Yeah. I mean your words just reverberate off of the page. You have this uncanny ability to take the reader through an emotional journey that isn't contrived or try hardy, like it just is. I mean, your writing is from the subconscious heart. Effortless. Wow. Thank you. You're welcome. So, do you ever write about yourself? Me? No, never. I'm boring. You're not boring. You know, it makes me wonder, even though I don't really know you all that well, why you're still here in this town? I mean you say you wanna give a voice to the voiceless right? So why don't you go out into the world and do it? I mean, you said it yourself, you've already written about everybody else in this town, why not go out and take the world by storm? I don't know. I've got too much to do here. You know, too many people that depend on me. This is my world. Well, I think you should reconsider. I think you could do a lot of good if you decided to try to make the world your world. But hey, that's just me. That's the North Star. Duh. It's in the North. Okay Mr. Know it all. What's that? Those three right there? That's Orion's Belt. I took astronomy in college, so come at me. See that constellation right there? What's that? Oh, that is, that's Seabiscuit because it's shaped like a horseshoe. Well. You see that five star cluster right there? That is the Wu-Tang Clan. No. It can't be the Wu-Tang Clan if there's only five stars in the cluster. So? So there are 10 members in the Wu-Tang Clan. No there's not. Yes there is. That's way too many. There's RZA, GZA, Method Man, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Cappadonna and Ol' Dirty Bastard. May he rest in peace. Tammy was a big hip hop fan. We always used to listen to her CD. God, her parents were so mad when they found it. Oh thank God they never found her Playboy. You mean? Oh she was curious. Oh. Yeah, no, my dad would have killed me if he every found my Playboy. Really? Yeah. Turns out that when your father is a genius and has every intellectual kissing his ass, he turns into kind of a dick. Now I'm just doing everything I can to make sure that I'm not a total disappointment. For you. Thank you. You're welcome. What's that? Chocolate chew. My mom always gave me one when I do something good, and now I get one every time I do something new. Well, you drove for the first time tonight, so you deserve it. Yes I do. Yeah. You know, they say that everyone has their fears, but good writers live them out. Great writers put them on the page. Who said that? I don't know. But, that's your first writing assignment. Challenge accepted. Yeah? Okay. Hey, no. Hey! You're good. What was that? Come on. Okay. On the couch. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. Those are mine. I know. I'm hot, I'm hot. I know, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Go to bed? Whatever. Sleep deep, dream sweet. Morning Jackie! Hey Emma! What happened? Got a flat. Just put a spare in. Well I couldn't sleep last night so I did the assignment. Oh cool. All right, well it shouldn't take me too long to look over these if you wanna hang out? Oh no, I can't. Got too much work to do. You know, busy, busy, busy day! I've got the garden, then the farm, then the iron mine... You know, I was actually planning on going to the iron mine later for work. Maybe I can join you? Um, yeah. Yeah we can do that. Okay, great, yeah. Let me go put this in a safe place, and I will be right back. Alrighty roo. Alrighty roo. To indict fear, one must go below the surface of the mind. To the darkest recesses of the soul with love as your weapon. A tool that... Hey Emma, where's the pickax? Emma! Paligrini said that I don't get the strawberries until next weekend 'cause that's when they come in. But they they tried to sell me basil for 4.25 and I told them that I always got them for 2.45 so I got the deal. I'm thinking about putting cucumbers next to the zucchini. Or maybe, maybe by the tomatoes, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. God it's so nice out here. Yeah, I like taking care of peoples stuff. This is your moms right? Yeah, she made it. I just maintain it. Try this. Wow. Good right? I wish I had this growing up. Yeah, farms are pretty nifty. The horses are Brian's, the goats are my domain. You know, I'm a goat gal. Yeah, no, I mean farms are pretty nifty, I guess I was referring more to like a childhood. You know, I was never really a normal kid. Never had friends. I still remember this one time in college, I told my professor that he was misusing that instead of which. What's wrong with that? You were right. Well, he was a Nobel Prize winner and he was my father. And I was wrong, so. Well you showed him. Now you're a big shot New York Times journalist. Well, I wouldn't say big shot. Okay, little shot. That's more accurate. So, who were you talking in the garden earlier? My mom. Oh. You know, they actually say that imagination is really good for a writer to have. It's how you make the ordinary seem extraordinary. Yeah, for a writer, kind of cheesy. I'm sorry? Cheesy. Cliche, sappy? I, no, I'm not. Hey, let's do it. Let's be kids. You said you never got to be a kid so let's be a kid. You know, as they say, the imagination is a way to make the ordinary seem extraordinary. Funny. Three, two, one! Ready or not, here I come! Ah snake! Stick! Never mind, it was just a stick! False alarm. My dad always said that I ran before I walked and I climbed before I rhymed. Oh, okay. How did you even get up there? Let's see. Poisonous or not poisonous? Not poisonous. Correct. Yes! Oh no. What? That one might be poisonous. Oh, oh okay, okay! It's not poisonous! He's Boris. Yeah, I could live with Boris. Hello Boris. How ya doing Boris? Very well 'cause my name is Boris. He's not a vampire. Thanks for this. Don't mention it. Biggest fear, go. I don't know. Come on. Okay, what about you? I mean besides my brother and sharks, and ranch. Getting castrated. Gross. What? It's a legitimate fear. You know, I've seen at least 20 stories of guys getting their junk chopped off because they betrayed their wife, or girlfriend, or boyfriend. I mean in Thailand, it's an epidemic. Do you think they deserved it? To be punished? Yeah, sure. I mean they did something wrong and there should be consequences. You know, has anybody ever done something to you that was so bad that you thought about doing something extreme? No. Never? Letting people down, that's my biggest fear. Oh and being late and hiccups of course. Oh, I'm totally with you on the hiccups. Yeah, whenever my hiccups show up I'm just like, when are you gonna get away hiccups? Oh, see, I scare mine. How? I say, "Hiccups, you better get out of here "or I'm gonna call the police." And then they leave? No never. Perfect. You know, we actually went the wrong way. But it's faster to go back this way. Are you all right? I'm fine! I'm fine, I'm fine! You know, you go ahead. I'll come over later for notes for my assignment. Jack, I did some Google on this story of yours and I love it! And with this girl you have, with this first person account, it's a slam dunk. Listen, Greg, I was thinking, why don't we do a piece just on the shooting? Yeah, no, I think that will be more interesting. I was thinking about it, right, and I think doing the first person angle might be a little heavy handed. Are you an insane person? Her POV is what makes this special. Without her, no one's getting to page two. Just trust, please! Mr. Cohen, we have reviewed the case and come to the conclusion that you are in fact guilty of plagiarizing your fellow classmate Mr. Rick Stanley's work. And as such, have broken the ethical guidelines of Harvard University and are hereby expelled. Well, congratulations Jack, you just screwed up your whole life. To indict fear, one must go below the surface of the mind. To the darkest recesses of the soul with love as your weapon. That is the philosophy I see Ellis having 10 years after this tragic event. No Veronica, he's nice. I know how city boys can be but he's different. No, stop it. I'm old enough to hang out with boys by myself. I don't know, I know I just met him but he's weird. Like weird in a good way you know? Just, this feels like for the first time in a long time, someone is actually listening to me. Yes dad, I'll be careful. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if he likes me. I think I messed up yesterday though. I freaked out at the bridge. He probably thinks I'm crazy. No, nothing happened. We did bump shoulders though. Yeah, they touched for like two seconds. Like this. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Almost three Mississippi but not quite, we let go. He didn't bump me hard, it was an accident. No yeah, it was totally on purpose. I think I like him. Yeah, I think I like him. Jack! Jack, it's Emma! Coming. Hey. Hello. How's it going? Good. Good. Sorry I didn't show up last night. I just, I got a little bit busy. Ah, don't even worry about it. You know, I had plenty to do, so no big deal. Wanna go to the carnival? I would, but I can't. Ever seen a horse give birth? Wait, is that a ride? Winner, winner, winner, winner. When is it supposed to happen? Wait for it. Hey, we're headed to the rehearsal dinner. Where are you? So, I'm sorry again about the bridge yesterday. No, I'm sorry. I think I was just tired. Yeah. Yeah no, I mean you had a long day. Do you wanna go back to your place? Uh... Yeah sure. No, carnies aren't creepy, they're nice. I mean Champ even worked the carnival once. Why does that not surprise me? Sorry. It's just. Like they go from town to town, right? And there's just something about like wanderers, these vagabonds that I just don't trust. Maybe vagabonds isn't the right word, but they just give me like this weird vibe, you know? Yeah, well, you can be weird sometimes. And weird means unique. And unique is good. Okay. Man, those rose colored lenses you see the world through, it must be nice. Yeah. Yeah they are. I'm not naive though. I know that there is bad in the world. So why wouldn't you wanna see it with a pink tint? It's nice. What? That was my first kiss. Oh. Um... How was it? Meh. Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Nice. My dad taught me. What does he do now? Your dad. You know, now that he doesn't work at the mine? Well he doesn't, um, like technically work at the mine, but he still helps the people who work there you know. Like guides 'em and stuff. Guides them? Yeah, he like, he like gives them advice. Emma... Yeah, I'm bored. We should, we should swim the lake. Emma... You know what, we can race across and you don't have to worry - because the sharks - Emma. Only really feed in the morning. So you don't have to worry about that. Emma I... And I just need to remember... I saw you at the cemetery. So? You know, I was just walking by and I saw you there, and when you left I went and I read the names on the tombstones and I searched them. And I know. I know about the shooting. Brian, Veronica, Tammy, your parents. I just wanted to let you know that I know. You know it's like no big deal, but I just felt like I should share that with you. Look, it's not a big deal. You're gonna think I'm stupid. No, no, no, no. I would never think that you're stupid. You know, it's just, you don't understand. I don't understand? You, you, you, you, you don't understand. - I understand perfectly fine. - That's not what I meant. Just 'cause I didn't live in like some stupid big city like Barcelona or whatever, I understand. I know you do, that's not what I meant. No, no, no, no. Listen, I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it! - I don't wanna talk about! - I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it! - I don't wanna talk about it! - I'm sorry. - I don't wanna talk about it! - I'm sorry. - I don't wanna talk about it! - Emma, I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it! I don't wanna talk about it! - Please stop! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna talk about it! I don't wanna talk about it! Champ: Open the door Jack! Oh, crap. Oh no. Crap. Open the door Jack. Emma. Emma? Emma where'd you go? Open the door Jack! I'm going to die. Hey Champ. Where is she? Where is who? Where is who? Where is she? She's not here man. Just calm down. She's not here. She's not? No. Emma. Emma! I told you man, she's not here. Oh. What are you... No. Champ. Champ, Champ, stop it! Stop! Stop! Stay away from her. Emma let's go. Emma let's go! Why'd you have to do that? Because he was taking advantage of you. You don't understand Emma, okay... Why do people keep saying that? I understand, I understand perfectly fine. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying. I'm not an idiot! I'm... I know you're not. - I know you're not an idiot. - You don't need to Protect me Champ. I'm perfectly... Yes I do! You keep saying you understand, but you don't. You walk around all day with a smile but shit isn't happy okay. It hasn't been for a while. But I like that you smile. That's why I protect you from things like this - and people like that. - No. - So you can keep smiling. - No you protect me So you can feel better. It's not for me, it's for you. It's for you to feel better. I'm fine Champ. I'm happy. I'm really, I'm fine. What am I supposed to do? Hm? Answer me, what am I supposed to do? I went to war and when I came back my world was destroyed. I let you down, - I let mom down, - You didn't let - I let dad down - any of us down. I should've been on that bridge but I wasn't and I regret that every day of my life. And I will never let that happen again. So no, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let some guy come in here and mess with your mind! He's not messing with my mind. I know exactly what is happening! Why him? You don't even know him. Why him? Because he treats me like a normal, like a normal person. I like him Champ. I like him a lot and I'm not a fragile egg. I know exactly what I'm doing. I figured out not only how to take care of myself but to take care of everybody else. And you, you would have just left and be forgotten. You would've just accepted what happened and moved on. You have moved on, but I figured out a way to maintain. I figured out - a way to keep their memory... - You don't know What's best for you Emma! Yes I do, Champ! You don't! Yes, I do! You think you do, but you don't. I'm on the outside, okay. I can see it. I can see it. You couldn't protect me then why do you think you can protect me now? Ah! God! Sometimes he gets ahead of himself. I mean, it's not just you, he thinks everyone's out to get me, so. Is your eye okay? He's just trying replace them. He's just trying to live up. Always has been ever since... That day. I was gonna leave. I wasn't even gonna tell anyone, I was just gonna go. I was 16. I wanted to live, I wanted new experiences. I didn't think this place was enough. My bags were packed, I was at the bus stop, waiting for the bus. That's when it happened. - I was just confused - Emma I'm so sorry. With who I needed to be and who I wanted to be, you know. I needed to be here. I needed to be with them. Because maybe if I had been with them - then it wouldn't, - Emma. It wouldn't. - I shouldn't have - Emma. Tried to go because it wasn't... Emma. Emma it would have happened whether you were here or not. I'm not crazy. I know. I know. Good. Night Jack. Goodnight Emma. Jack, I don't know what the hell is going on. You do not ignore me! I am your father. Your brother's ceremony is in an hour. Your mom's freaking out, you're letting your family down for some mediocre story. Worst part is I'm not even surprised. But I'm done. So let me be frank. I've been writing long enough to know that it's not gonna happen for you. It's time to come back to reality and get your priorities in check. Call me back. Looks like Champ came over to say hi. Yeah. Listen, is there any chance that we could salvage this? No. Great. Emma, I, uh I'm sorry for what I did. He just... I'm sorry. You're all I got, so. I know. But you're wrong. You've got beer. Yeah, I do. I do have beer. If you like him, like if you really like him, I'm okay with it. I wrote it forever ago. But you always said that your business is like a murder, you know, you gotta keep it quiet. So I never made it to the Weekly Spotlight. You really think all this crap about me? Of course. You're my person. Hey Jack. Crap. No, no, no, no, no, no. What, does he have? A box of guns? I see you. Open the door! Just leave me alone man. I'm leaving tomorrow. Was it open? For your novels or whatever. Article. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, I know it's not my place, but I, I think Emma's just looking for a little bit of freedom. Emma's all I got man. And despite what she might think, I'm all she's got. She's like a deer with a broken leg. So, she's gotta keep moving and living as if she ain't got a broken leg, but the problem is, all that moving is gonna catch up. Someone or something is gonna catch up. And when they do, she's not gonna know how to defend herself 'cause she's only got three legs. But this whole time, she's been pretending that she's got four. You know? Yeah. It's a metaphor man. I thought you were supposed to be like a smart person? It was a metaphor. Uh... Okay. 10 years ago three of Emma's friends and our parents, they were... I know. You know? You know? And you still didn't get my metaphor? I'm just a city bitch. She blames herself. That's why she'll never leave. Always where she needs to be, like a button. It's a metaphor. That's actually a simile. The reason that I'm telling you this is 'cause she trusts you. She never dealt with any of this crap man and I don't know what to do. She walks around all day helping people in town as like a distraction. She never even been to the funeral. Maybe that's what it needs? What? Maybe that's what she needs. Yeah, you know. Some perfect ending. What are you talking about? She's never had any closure right? So we need to give that to her. Yeah. You know what we have to do right? I'm not digging up those bodies. What? No. All right. She loves to garden. She can't spend enough time there. She always says that one lifetime isn't enough to accomplish ones horticultural goals. I don't know, I just think it's really beautiful because even after he died he was able to give these people meaning. My dad always said that I ran before I walked and I climbed before I rhymed. Tammy was a big hip hop girl. The horses are Brian's, the goats are my domain. You know, I'm a goat gal. She walks around all day helping people in town as like a distraction. She never even been to the funeral. Bags are packed. I was at the bus stop, that's when it happened. - I was just so confused - I'm so sorry. With who I needed to be and who I wanted to be, you know. I'm not crazy. I know. Hey Greg, it's Jack. I just wanted to let you know that I'm almost done with the article. I'm just waiting on one more piece but feeling really good about it. I won't be able to email it to you though because I ran into some technical difficulties. But I'll be hand delivering them tomorrow. I mean, who needs internet? Am I right? Anyway, if you need anything, just give me a call. I'm around. So... Yeah... Okay, bye. In the end, no matter what mask you put on, underneath it, the reveal will always be the same. For we are all made up of flesh, bone, blood, and stardust. Just trying to escape. To free ourselves from confinement from control of our own making. We try to exist behind the pain until we are forced to confront it. And for me, that day has come. My purple flip-flops sink so far into the dirt that I might as well not have shoes on. It's as if the earth is telling me I'm not going to leave. I feel the heat of Ricky's breath as the words hit my ringing ear. Death is all I hear. A foe I would soon be forced to befriend. The news traveled through my body like a tornado. Welling my eyes, halting my mouth, closing my throat, yet stopping at my heart. It was if there was a safety net. As if five people caught me mid-fall springing me back up. This is when I realized that this would not be their end. He could not dictate their finale. This would not be their story, so it became my story. Our story. I don't know if there is life after death, or ghosts, or even God, but I do know one thing, if I couldn't fight to keep them alive, I would fight to give their memories a pulse, a rhythm, a heartbeat. So I live to protect it, to honor it. Jack! Jack? Rose Colored Lenses by Jack Cohen. 10 years after a rogue shooting in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, We find Emma Ellis. Because he treats me like a normal, like a normal person. I'm not crazy. I know. She denies her lack of sanity, but anyone with a truthful eye could see otherwise. Feeling good? A drink would help. These are nice right? Yeah, she'll love them. Oh, she's here, she's here. Hey. What is this? Surprise. We just wanted to give you the funeral that you never got a chance to go to. "Her incomprehension of the event "may have stunted her more than the tragedy has?" What? "Emma Ellis is the only ghost "remaining from the shooting." It was John Maynard that night, not Matt Maynard you fucking asshole! Emma, I was gonna tell you. I was gonna ask for your consent. My consent? Yes, I wanted... Those stories weren't for you, they weren't for you! Emma, I wanted to help you. I don't need help! I don't need any help! I'm not the victim! What are you talking about? The story was about me Champ. It was about me, it was about the shooting, about us. I shouldn't have trusted him. He was only hanging out with me to get the story. I'm gonna kill you. Emma! Let me explain! I don't work for the New York Times! I work for the Milwaukee Gazette. Okay. I needed something. Then I found you and you were that something. You stole from me. I liked you and you stole from me, you stole my memories! The only thing that I have! But that's only because you were so amazing, okay? I was gonna give you co-writing credit. You're lying! No I'm not! Stop lying, just tell the truth! All right, fine. You wanna know the truth. I am a mediocre writer at best. Okay, the only thing that I ever wrote that had any semblance of notoriety was in college, and even then, my friend Rick help me write it. My dad thinks I'm a disappointment, right. I always had this idea that I could be this great journalist, like Carl Bernstein, but I never will be, you know? 'Cause... 'cause I'm not good enough. I'm not you Emma. Okay, you write from the heart. I try, I try so hard to do that you know. And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try and I fail! Every single time! You know how hard that is? To be working for something your entire life to come into a town and to find somebody that's better than you and has no idea? I don't care, I don't care, I don't care! You don't care about me! You don't care about my story! All you care about is your stupid career! That's not true, I wanna help you! No, you don't understand! I'm fine! I was gonna go out into the world, I was gonna leave! I was going to go tell ordinary peoples extraordinary story. Then the people I found the most extraordinary were taken from me. I lost my chance. The world lost their chance to know my people so I promised I would never make that mistake again and I have held my promise for the last 10 years and written about every person in town so they know that their story will continue to live long after their gone. What about your friends and family? I mean doesn't their story deserve to live on? Yes it does. And I do so by visiting where their memories live every single day! But I could never write about it and then you come here and you remind me of where I was going! Where I could have gone and you listened to me, and you ask about them. You ask about them with no judgment and finally, I could find a way to create a way for their stories to stay alive, but beyond where their memories live. I finally felt free. Just to find out that it all comes from a lie. And then you stole it from me. But what about you Emma? Doesn't your story deserve to be told? Yeah. Yeah, every story deserves to be told. But why would I want mine told by a fraud? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Hey, Greg. Listen, I am so sorry. I had... I'm on my way to the office, it's just that my car, um... Jack, I don't know what you've been doing up until now, but, this was good my friend. This was good. It was great. What? What do you mean what? The article jackass. What article? I... Jack, the way you put those ideas together, it left me speechless. But I can't be speechless right now. I'm too excited. It really moved me man. I mean, I actually was crying after that first paragraph. Last time I cried like that, when I found out "The Bachelor" wasn't real. I mean Jack, that was unbelievable. It's like you've been holding out on me. It's like you've been teasing me for two years and then suddenly, you get my pants off and you see that I'm a woman. That's how I felt reading that. You're very sneaky Jackie. Am I supposed to tip you? Such a strong hold on all those victims point of view. And in the first person. Who are you channeling pal? Jack, how did you do it? Yeah. No, it just uh... just came to me. Tell you what, this is gonna put the Milwaukee Gazette on the map.
