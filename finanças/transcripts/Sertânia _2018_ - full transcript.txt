Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I know all about the cowboys and the bandits They are the fearless men of northeastern Brazil The cowboys ride horses and the bandits carry rifles Gavião's life is well known He scared many people and he'd always cross the line But Gavião had his reasons to do what he did in life Neblina! It looks like I've got home. The end of the journey. I'm home. Goddamn it! If I had seme salt, pepper and lime, to step on, and hurt, and a papaya stem to blew into the hole, I'd heal right away. If Captain Jesuíno came with his comrades to get me out of here, he'd take care of my gunshot wound. He'd take care of me. But he fired. Goddamn it! Captain Jesuíno shot me. He shouldn't have done so. Or maybe he should have. Have you lost your mind, Gavião? Are you losing it? Losing it? Me? Losing my mind? It only appears so. The boys are having fun. Now the racket is getting good! Meia Lua! Yes, Captain! Tell the boys I don't want them to be disrespectful with the family girls. Those who want women can go look for whores on the streets. Captain? I think it's not going to rain this year. It's not going to rain. What do you think, Captain? I don't know, Seu Amphilophio I don't know. The ovenbirds are not building nests with the door facing the rising sun. The ants are not sheltered at the river banks. I think we re going to have winter. We were there having fun. Watching the Captain talking to Seu Amphilophio, with the town Judge and Father Colombé, and his thugs at the forró dance. Captain Jesuíno did mot suspect anything. As he talked, he gave no hint at all. Was the Captain getting weak? That struck my mind right away. Was he losing the sense that allowed him to foresee what hadn't happened yet? Oh, well. There he was. Jesuíno Mourão, the one in leather, the king of the backlands, with the "Yellow Boy" in his hands. Just looking at him gave me the creeps. My body didn't want to get closer to that scum. I wanted to see his eyes, but I couldn't. I wanted to see his arms givin up, his hands opening and dropping the rifle. But I couldn't. I knew you were going to show up one day, Seu Antão. To grow up to be a man. We'd have to bump into each other one day. We had to have this encounter. Shoot if you're a real man. Shoot if you're a real man. His lips were trembling. Come on, be a man! Am I an animal? Am I an animal? Deep inside, Captain Jesuíno could believe he was a man. How about the doctor? Doctor Sampaio, Seu Filó, Father Colombé. Is it possible that only they were men? What difference does it make? Does it make a difference at all? Oh, well! Suddenly it was so silent that we could hear the fly whizzing over the goat meat. It's a pleasure. You're beautiful. It must feel good to touch. To touch it with my fingertips. But I have a request to make. Then do it. I'll prove to Dona Santinha that Captain Leather is a man of my word. I won't ask for anything. But you can take the gold chain. I owe you one, Santinha. I owe you one. There come the Pernambuco troops! This one! I got another one! Antão, my son... Come over here. Be careful so you won't get burned. It's hot. I've just made it. Is this good? Has father died, mom? Has father died? Where's father, mom? Where's father? Oh, mother, one day I shall reach the holy glory. Standing by the Virgin Mary, in heaven I shall triumph. I shall be in heaven with my mother. I shall be in heaven with my mother. I shall be with my mother, but since I have offended, I shall mourn my guilt to dear Jesus. I shall be in heaven with my mother. I shall be in heaven with my mother. There shall be many hats for a few heads. The waters shall be stained with blood and the planet will rise in the spring. The stars shall shower from the skies. And that shall be the end of the world. In fact, I must tell you. When the nations start fighting, Brazil against Brazil, England against England, Prussia against Prussia, Dom Sebastião will come out of the sea with his entire army. And when Dom Sebastião was charmed, he thrust his sword into the stone. All the way to the hilt, And he said: "Goodbye, world". Up to a thousand, even more. But you shall not reach two thousand. On tha day, when he marches with his army, he shall kill all with razor's edge. And the blood shall spill down to their knees. Mother has died. I won't stay here. I'm going back to the backlands. You. You're coming with me. You're coming with me to São Paulo. Sargent! Yes, Major! Who is he? His name is Antão. My son. Sargent take the boy too, he's going to São Paulo with his mother. What about that child, Miss Maria? The little brat has come with the Major. He's come with his mother. But she stayed back in town. She works at the Major's house. The poor thing came to the farm to work. But his father was a bandit! A bandit from Bahia who got killed, because he was against the Republic and religion. Colonel. Antão. I'm looking for Lieutenant Josias at Liberty Headquarters. He's rallying the troops that will fight the workers anil anarchists, the enemies of the Republic. Show him his letter, and he will let you enlist. Has father died, mom? Has father died? You father died long ago, my son! Mother has died. I won't stay here. I'm going back to the backlands. General. Corporal Antão. We must fight. We must defend the republic from the liberal quarrel. A nation cannot exist without order. And disorder must be crushed before spreading all over the country. I highly appreciate your knowledge about the São Paulo army, Seu Antão. But we only fight in brigades here. We ambush. We cover the rear front, we surround the retreat. Those little things. Now with your help, we'll be able to fight those monkeys in battalion war. To begin with, your name is no longer Antonio, for that's a name for a man with a dubious name. From now on, your name is Jararaca, the snake that strikes. Neblina. Captain Jesuíno, has ordered a retreat. Retreat? Is Jesuíno turning into a coward? Those are the Captain's orders! Neblina. Jararaca. They've got reinforcements. Lieutenant Zé Rufino and his troops. Well have to retreat, they're clamping down. The Captain is right, let us retreat. Fine, then! Are you afraid of dying too? There's no way out, brother. Don't say that. I'm bidding farewell to you and the other comrades. Don't say that. I need you alive to fight the monkeys. Don't say that. This is what we're worth. We live and we die. We kill. And we also get killed. There's nothing else to it. Antão Jararaca. You are the bravest man here, you're not afraid of anything, take care of me during this passage, brother. I'm by your side. I'm right here. It's getting dark, brother. Hold tight. I can't see anything, brother. Not even you. A man to find a log to carry my brother and bury him in the woods. I'll go, Captain. I'll get a piece of wood to bury your brother. Then go. Go, Jararaca. If the monkeys surround you, I'll come to die by your side. I'll never forget what you've done today, Comrade Antão Jararaca. Helping to bury my little brother Neblina. He's gone to another world. He won't fighting with us anymore. Antão Jararaca. From now on, you won't have a snake's name anymore. You'll be called Gavião. The snake killer. Neblina liked to look at the sky. The clouds opened. And he'd see the saints, the angels, the Holy Virgin. Then he'd come to tell us what the sky was like. Could he possibly be up there now? May I ask you something, Gavião? No offense. Do you believe in reincarnation? Do you think that one day, at the end of times, Neblina, Antonio, and Cristino will live again, in flesh and blood? Comrade Antão Jararaca a.k.a Gavião. Do you believe in God? Pray to God? Mom used to pray. Every single day. Whenever she could, she'd pray. Father Cícero gave that to me when I was in Juazeiro. Now the gift is yours. For the rest of your life. A gift from a friend, Captain. I appreciate that. In exchange, I'll give you the fulgurite that my mother picked up in Canudos. That was when Conselheiro passed away. She said the night was bright and the stars showered in the sky. You're very worthy, my friend Antão Gavião. Very worthy. We've got a lot in common. We should've been brothers. My comrade, Captain Jesuíno, what do you think? You're the one who knows it. Has father died, mom? Has father died? Corporate Antão. We must fight to defend the Republic from the liberal quarrel. I put an end to hunger in the backlands. Antão! I put an end to hunger in the backlands! Antão? You're back. You shouldn't have come back. Goddamn it! You're very brave. The King of Valor. Peer of France! You should be praised in the verses the troubadours sing at the fairs. Captain Jesuíno? What are you doing here? I had no time to announce. I've come by just to ask for your blessing, Father Columbé. And tell you that I've fulfilled the commandments you told me to carry out. How's that? You needn't worry about what was bothering you. It's all good now, in the peace of God. Thank you very much, Captain. God bless. God bless. I'm very thankful. I confess I wasn't expecting for you here. I've just come to settle some scores here. Nothing much. Some little things. Colonel Militão das Quixaba sent me. I'm under his orders. I'll leave with the boys after midnight. It's the Holy Ghost, Captain. Praised be our Lord Jesus Christ. Praised be Him forever. Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. You're under arrest, you monkeys. Who are you? Varisto. Sargent Varisto. Can't you recognize me? You're not a man, Jesuíno. You're scared as shit. Your wife has been sleeping with Gavião! Sargent Varisto. Can't you recognize me? Captain Jesuíno Mourão, in leather, the king of the backlands, in flesh, bone and soul. I'm coming to love, to come, and to wish well. But Captain. I wasn't expecting you. I'm like this. I always arrive unexpectedly. When people are waiting for me, I don't come at all. You're all going to die, you'd better know that, you bunch of monkeys. I came to set Antão Gavião free. If you've laid a finger on him, I'm going to cut off your balls with a pair of pliers. Let's release the prisoners. Captain? My brother. I'm very happy to see you. Gavião! You wuss! You say you're brave, but the São Paulo solders banged you. Drop that attitude because you're a cuckold, Jesuíno. It shouldn't ever rain again. This soil should crack dry, and the woods should burn down to the ground. God and the Virgin cannot help us. Sometimes only the devil can. Only the devil can help us. Don't blaspheme, Captain. Don't blaspheme. It's nobody's fault that we're bandits. Neither God's nor the Virgin's. You should stop saying nonsense, Antão. You're not good enough to be a priest. And it seems you're not good enough to be a gunman either. You should give up your rifle and the harness and stop fooling around. You should find yourself a farmer's daughter and marry her. Why don't you marry Dona Mocinha, the daughter of Colonel Militão? She's got big legs and pointy nipples. You're the one who's fooling around, Captain. You're the one who's fooling around, Captain. Our comrades turned away. They didn't want to get involved. Perhaps they didn't believe we were dueling for real. It looked more like a play we were staging to appease the anger caused by the lack of water. When we summon the devil, he shows up. Maybe he was even there himself, with his finger on the trigger, aiming the rifles. I'm getting blind, Captain! I can't see a thing! It's dark! Lieutenant Rufino! Evaristo! I'm blind, Sargent! I'm blind! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. What is your name? Zé Mandioca. I'm Jesuíno. She doesn't know anything. - She can't see anything. - Nothing. She's blind, deaf, and dumb. She can't recognize anyone. Neither father nor mother. Nobody at all. She's like a loner. Sometimes someone comes over to visit. Some people come to visit. She's like a loner. She's otherworldly. She lives in darkness. She can't see a thing. She can't see her father nor her mother. She's like a loner. Blind and deaf. That was the only time I saw the Captain sad. We were leaving the shallows, walking to Brejo do Bugre where the brave Pancarare Indians live down the Chico river, almost reaching Trindade. The blind and deaf girl, who's never seen her mother's face, nor heard her voice in her life, has always lived in the dark and in silence. She's not human, she is less than an animal. That's worse than hell. If God was really a God, He shouldn't let a human being live like that. The Captain stopped, and sadness took over, deep inside. He didn't cry, though. I've only seen the Captain cry once, when Neblina, his brother, was shot down and we buried him. Captain... Have mercy on me, Captain. I have six children to feed. They have nobody else to look after them? Have mercy, Captain... I've come to introduce myself. I'm not a man who runs away from fate. I may even die at the tip of a dagger. The Captain can choose any of his men to fight against me. For me, there's no such a thing as left or right. All monkeys are the same. They say the people hate Captain Jesuíno, the one in leather, the "Mortá". They have no reason. When Jesuíno comes, he's as good as rice pudding. As long as he's calm. When upset, he's like a Gila Monster. When Jesuíno sleeps, the can see with his blind eye. The eye that never shuts. He can see what we cannot. The Captain. The Prince of Darkness. Midnight at the crossroads? They say he made a deal with the evil one. Beelzebub. Satan himself. No bullet can kill him, no dagger can penetrate his skin. He's become unbreakable through the blood of the innocent. Nobody can appease the Captain, or the demon inside him. To live on to die. What's the difference? Both have the same value. And you pay the same price. If it's to die, every hour is convenient, for when the time comes, you'll look in the bottom of the bowl, for what's left of the flour. It doesn't make a difference to have a handful or nothing at all. If you're to have anything, let there be plentifulness. The gourd spilling out in, a life of fantasy and melodies, as the kings of the world, with no harness on our backs and free of all reins. There's no way back, Gavião. There's no way back. Don't lose your mind, Gavião. Who knows? Maybe the path will take to good soil with green grass for the cattle to graze in abundance and live a peaceful life. Antão? You're back. You shouldn't have come back. Where have you been? Nothing has changed since, you've gone away, for such a long time. Here's the man, Colonel. Are you Lieutenant Mané Rufino? Can't you recognize me Doctor Queiroz? But since we're here, let's not have a wasted trip. Let us make a deal, Doctor. You have talent to deal with money, don't you? Talk to Colonel Tibúrcio, Doctor Sampaio, Seu Amphilophio. The tradesmen. You should collect 25 contos de réis. This is the price I am asking, with all due consideration, so that the boys won't spread havoc around this place. So that they won't plunder this town. But if the money doesn't show up, we'll have to search the chests inside the houses, in the drawers, in the vaults of the commercial houses. In that case, it is quite possible that we'll find more money than what I'm asking you, right? Captain, the people say that the migrants are headed this way. They're coming to plunder the town. They want the food from Colonel Tibúrcio's grocery stores, the fabrics and shoes from the shops. Oh, my God. Run! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Give me some food, give me! We have something to propose, Captain. With the support of Colonel Tibúrcio, the farmers and the local merchants, we will be able to collect all the money you asked for. But we have a counter-proposal. You must defend the city against the migrants, kick them out of here, then we'll pay you 20 contos de réis. Don't play the fool. 20 contos? We wouldn't do that for a meager 20 contos. When the people arrive, I want to see what Colonel Tibúrcios grocery stores and Seu Amphilophio's shops will look like. We've managed to collect 35 contos de réis, Captain. We can't raise any more. If you do the job, you'll have free access into town from this day on. That's a task for a monkey, Captain. Chasing migrants away. They pay the ransom and we leave, for we've been here too long. Lieutenant Rufino is pecking around. Take it easy, Gavião, for I'm interested in the proposal. 35 contos, Colonel? Make it 40. It's an even number. I want to see the color of money. What is going on? So hungry! So hungry! Be patient, young ones... It hurts! We can't do anything, we have nothing to eat. Be patient. Be patient. Beg God. Be patient, He'll come. There will be food, be patient, young ones. You'll overcome this, we all will. Give me some rice... Give me... We walk with faith in our hearts, my daughters. We're going make it. In the name of Jesus, we're going to. That day, hell almost broke loose. The market burned to the ground, and so many dogs died that we lost track of it. Antão? Neblina. Have you died? No. I came because I had to, but I'll go back. What about you? I'm waiting for the ferry to cross the river. I'm on my way. I can't wait for you, I have things to do. I'm sorry, but you're not done yet. Yeu can't go on that trip. I came because I had to. What's your name? I'm sorry for asking, but there are so many people coming here these days. Antão Jararaca, of Jesuíno's gang, the one in leather, a.k.a. Gavião. I've been here for so long, and I've never seen anyone come here willingly. They're always forced into it. In my ease, I had to come. It's a matter of necessity. I need to clear something up with someone who's been on the other side for long. I'll do that, come back and do my duty. I can't go on living without making sure, so when my time comes, I'll come back to this side for good, then I won't ever go back there. There's something to pay though. You have to pay double. The passage plus the weight of the guns. He who takes advantage of the meal doesn't waste the corn. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? You're hurt, my son! Who did that to you? It's nothing, mother. I'm fine. What about you? I need to know about you. Misfortune... Come back, Antão. Come back to life, my son. Come back to life. Don't forget me, my boy. Don't forget me, okay? Mother... Come back, Antão. Come back. Come back, my son. How about father, mom? How about father, mom? Mother... Mother! How about father, mom? Your blessing, Colonel Delmiro Gouveia. Antão. Are you around here too? Not yet, not yet. I only get shot. Like yourself. But my time has yet to come? I came because I had to. I need to see my father. Have you seen him around? No, I'm afraid I haven't. I also wanted to know if the shot that hit you at the cottage was fired by me or someone else. The devil. Relax. That doesn't matter anymore. I need to know. I need to know. I need to know, Colonel Calm down, man! What about the people? How are the people doing? Is the textile factory prospering? The Colonel should've gone to São Paulo. To set up the textile factory there. That's a fit place for a factory. Here it can't succeed. They won't allow it. What about the plant? Is it generating energy? I wasn't the one who fired a shot on purpose! It was the other one! The Who, the One-Eyed! The Hollow-Eyed! He'd whisper: "Aim at him, aim at him, Antão!" "Aim while you sleep!". Between the left cavity and the ribs. You can't miss it. - Come on, Antão Silvino! - What about the people, Antão? The people are hungry, do the people have what to eat? When the drought comes to the backlands, the people have nothing to eat? What about the English? Have they left the backlands? Do the people remember me? The troubadours at the fair sing verses to remember you. One day someone's going to write a book! And someone will make a movie! A movie where the two of us, who have never met up there under the sun because we couldn't, shall meet right here! Right here, Antão! In the valley of "shadows". I put an end to hunger in the backlands, Antão. I put an end to hunger in the backlands. What about the father, Seu Delmiro? Have you seen my father? Can you help me, Seu Delmiro? Forget it, Antão! Forget it! Drink the water from Rio Gavião and forget about it! It's open! It's open! It's open! Food! Food! Water! Water! Food! Food! I've brought this for you, Captain. It's from Colonel Tibúrcio. Have mercy! Don't shoot, Captain. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! The people are not to blame for starving. The people are not to blame for starving. The people are not to blame for starving. The people are innocent. The people are not to blame for starving. There's no mystery. You loaded twice but couldn't fire. Look. Is it different from that? Come on, lead it. Cock it hard. Hard. That's it. Only once. At the camera axis! The camera axis! Point to the axis! A bit lower. That's it! Shoot it! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. The people are innocent! The people are not to blame for starving! The people are innocent! The people are not to blame for starving! The people are not to blame for starving! The people are not to blame for starving! Don't shoot. The people are not to blame for starving! They aren't to blame for starving! They aren't to blame for starving! That's nonsense, Gavião. Nonsense. The devil designs it, and we cut and sew it. Dance, for by dancing we can reach the heavens! I'm in the middle of the whirlwind! Goddamn it! I found the man, Sargent. Moita Brava. Can't you recognize me? We fought together with Mourão in the battle against Lieutenant Rufino. In Brejo Santo, Paraíba. After you joined the monkeys, amnestied. My name is Archangel. A bandit is a bandit, a soldier is a soldier. I'm now a Sargent with the Military Police of the State of Bahia. Take off that golden ring! I wish I had some water, salt and a handful of pepper to take care of this wound. What are you doing, Archangel? I'm pulling the ring off. Don't you do that in front of me! He's mine, Sir. I'm the one who found the bad guy hiding underneath the Cassia tree. I'm entitled to keep whatever he was carrying on him. I don't want to witness such cruelty, Sargent. This man is going to the station intact. Where's the haversack with the money, the gold and the sterling? They'll be used to pay the fees and procedural costs against that outlaw. All I wanted was to go back home. Long live Brazil! Despite all the problems, we're all Brazilian. Long live Brazil! Is this ever going to end? This is the 2018 Saint John Festival in Itaquaraí, Bahia! Antonio was to marry João's daughter But Peter fled with the bride Before they walked down the aisle. Antonio was to marry João's daughter But Peter fled with the bride Before they walked down the aisle.
