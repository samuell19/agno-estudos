Why are you walking away? Don’t you want your change? Give me your ticket. Get down! -Did you board from Duddikonda? -Yes. -Get down, please. -There are pickpockets. -in the complex surroundings. Beware. -Where to? Give me a ticket to Duvvada. -Don't take water or food -I will buy the ticket. -from unknown persons. -One ticket to Vizianagaram. Don’t talk too much! When will you return my money? I am coming to Tagarapuvalasa today. I want my money back. …you are calling, is not reachable at-- -Hello? -What happened? Why was your phone busy? Have you reached Vizag? Did you meet him? You haven't met him yet? Has he arrived? I don’t know. What is this? You went all the way on your own, not knowing how he looks! I am worried. Be careful. Look for him. If Murali doesn’t turn up, come back immediately. Okay? Hello! What happened? You understood, right? Okay. Give me a hundred. What? Why so much? The number you are trying to reach is out of the network coverage area. Please try after some time. The number you have dialed is not… Where do you want to go? Hey! Why are you sleeping on the platform? Get up! Get up! Hey! Go! -What is this? -Go away! Get going! Move! What are you looking at? Leave now! WOMEN Madam! Pay the money, madam. Satya! Satya! Satya! Satya! Make it quick. If we miss the bus, we might have to take the crowded jeep. Also, I have to call up my darling on the way. Just a minute. Oh, God! Let’s go. Let’s light a lamp before Kannaya on the way. You can do it when we get back. The bus might leave. It won’t. Walk fast. Why didn’t you call me last night? How can I, when I don’t have a phone? If you miss me so much, buy me one. Of course, I will buy you one, baby. Baby, I am coming to S. Kota for shopping… I am going to the town to buy lining cloth. Take care of Bujji till I return, please? Jalebi is tastier than kova. I like it very much. -I will get you both, baby. -We won’t miss the bus now? Look at you walking like a snail. Baby, let me call you back. Come now. When you'll have a boyfriend, you will know. How difficult it is to disconnect the call. Hey, hello! Hello! You! We moved here on rent recently. Please take my son in the rickshaw as well. I will pay you a little more than the others. Not possible. It is already full. You are already taking so many! What will happen if you take one more? Sure. Imagine if he hangs from here, and some car or bike passes by. He will land on one of them. How will you survive without even a little ambition? If the ambition gets the better of me, my rickshaw will overturn. If all rickshaw drivers were like you, -parents would have no tension, Murali. -Hey, move. Sit inside. -Dad, bye. -Bye. Uncle, bye. -Hey, have you done the homework? -I have. -I have as well. And you? -Yes, I did. Chitti, take your bag. -Hello? -Hello, Murali! I had asked you to come at ten to drop me at the hospital. -I hope you remember. -I have set the reminder. I am on my way. Cut the call. Hi, hello, namaste. This is your RJ Masti Meghana! Our topic today is… love. Oh, God! What a boring topic, right? Did you just say, “How could you say that?” You did, right? I heard it. But who gets bored of love? And why? Like the five elements of our universe, love is also constant. Greedy fellow! He crammed a bus full of people into a jeep. Look, my sandal strap broke. Okay. We have to pick up Bujji from Kannyya. Let’s go fast. What is this madness? Every time we step out of the village, you leave your toy with Kannaya! How many times should I tell you? When Bujji is with him, it’s as good as Kannaya is with me. Shall we go? Satya! Anasuya’s wedding is fixed with a boy from Kakinada. Really? She is very lucky! You sound as if the boy is from Canada. Then what? Kakinada has a beach, right? Yes. So? She can see the sea whenever she wants. What more does one want? Here, it’s for you. I guess this guy hears a siren as soon as I am home! -Baby! -Are you back? Come on. My dad will be home anytime. Baby, I will call you from my sister-in-law’s phone, okay? Don’t forget, okay? When you'll find someone, you will know. This guy wouldn’t cut the call. My dad wouldn’t buy me a phone. Your dad is better. He shouts a lot. But at least he bought you a phone. You call this a phone? Carry this in the city and they will think you are an alien. You know? Whatever. I don’t even have that. Hey, look at your idiot. I guess he freshened up and came early morning. Spare him a glance. It will make him happy. Shut up and walk. When I see Satya, my throat goes dry and I start sweating. This will not work out. Talk to her dad soon. That’s better. Do you think her dad will listen to me? Girls go by faces. But their dads go by pockets. So, that route is the best. Do you think so? Trust me. That’s the best. -Tell me if my baby calls. -Okay. Where were you? I went to Araku to buy some lining cloth. But the bus returned long back. The bus had left by the time I bought everything. I came by the jeep. And then it started raining. You are young. Stay home. Don’t attract attention. Of course! Look at the long queue waiting for me to step out. I don’t think he heard that. Shall I call him? I had a spring in my step just like you in my eighth standard. The day is not far when even you will cry like me. Does it match? This is a different color. Next time, shop for yourself. Strange girl! Hey! Stop singing and throw your card. Damn! My hand is full of queens. But not one in my life. Hey, I say this with experience. When your queen is not with you, you look forward to her. But once she comes in, you start wondering when she will bloody leave! Uncle, look! I need to experience it myself, right? At least to tell someone else. Hey, big owl! -Why are you laughing so loud? -He wants a queen. I will be happy with a maid. Come, Murali. Let’s play pool. No, brother. I have work. Hey! If you win one pool, you don’t have to work for four days. Easy money burns quickly, brother. I have the strength. I will work hard. Don’t have a discussion with good people. They spoil us. Pour a drink. What is left? It is empty. Are you done? Okay, I am coming. Okay, brother. I'll see you. But in all fairness, even though Murali is new to the village, -he has become popular. -Yes. That’s how youngsters should be. Look at you. Not worth a penny. Hey! Don’t laugh. That includes you. Hey, get me another pint! What is the hurry? Uncle, to see Satya. What is that in your hand? Camera phone. I know, but for what? To take pictures and post them on Facebook. You don’t open your class books. Do you really need Facebook? Give me the phone. Why are you so orthodox? Brahmam prophesied that in the 21st century, the world will be destroyed. I am sure you heard that. Nothing has happened yet. It is already destroyed. And because of this! Satya. Satya. I asked my sister-in-law for her camera phone. -Where is it? -Where? Your dad snatched it from me. Okay. One minute. Look at this. What is this? It costs seven thousand. If I save five thousand more, I can buy the phone. Will you lend me your phone then? We will see. Okay. But please get my phone back from your dad. My sister-in-law will go mad. What is it, brother? You like my voice? Tell me something new, boss! I don’t know -Hey, Murali! -how many of you have said this before… Why do you keep listening to this radio show? -Are you married? -Not yet, brother. Shall I find someone for you? There are beautiful girls in my lane. Beauty is not in the face, brother. It is in the voice. The voice should make us want to see the person. Her words should sound like a melody. Your thinking is as strange as your work ethic. Mom! Did you see my phone? How would I know where you left it? Oh, God! Everyone is after my phone! Mom, stop your stitching and look for it. I am getting late. Getting late? Where are you going? It’s Gokulashtami today. I will make an offering to Kannaya. Why worship a God without a temple? It’s just an idol. You might as well keep it at home. We must go to a temple or a school! We shouldn’t bring them home. You are not good at studies. But you're never short of maxims! Here! It is right here, and you are looking everywhere else. Who kept it here? This must be the little devil’s job! Satya! Uma hasn’t given the sample blouse. Please call her and find her measurements. Is that also my job now? Sister Uma, 34-36-30. Are the measurements the same or have any changes? Hello, who is this? What measurements? Can I speak to Uma? Who is she? Name-- Seven. Three. Six. Oh! I dialed six-three instead! Why don’t you check properly? What's the rush? Hello, Uma… The number you're trying to dial is busy right now. To send a voice SMS… Walk fast! What is the hurry? Kannaya will not go anywhere. Kannaya will not go. But your brother will get restless. What brother? Actually… -Actually… -What is it? Why are you twisting and turning? Guess where I am going? -To the temple! -No. I have come out to meet my baby. What? Am I supposed to go alone now? Brother, you could have brushed your teeth at home instead of all this! Of course, I did. But you must be extra careful when you meet your girl. -Brother! -Yes? Go and eat something at Mallesham’s. Okay, brother. How did you settle for this guy? Oh, God, don’t give him your evil eye. Did you dress up for this face? Get lost! At least I have him. You have no one. Baby… Who is she? Your friend? What is her name? Stop drooling. She is your sister. What happened, baby? Have you been under the Sun for too long? You have lost your complexion. You’ve just seen my friend. Of course, I will look dark. Why are you putting your hand on me? Not just my hand. I would plant a kiss as well. I have come prepared. What are you doing? Don’t you dare try this with me! Move! Move away! Now tell me whatever you want to. Why come all the way for this? We might as well talk over the phone. Does it hurt, baby? Of course, it does. See how I am bruised. Maybe. But it is lost in your complexion. She is showing off because she has a boyfriend. As if I won’t find one! I will show her then. I will find one, right? You will show him to me, right? Hello! So, madam, got the measurements, right? Oh, sorry. I dialed your number by mistake. It’s okay. You have a nice voice. May I know your name? "Nice voice." They get started once they know it's a girl. Okay, Kannaya, I am going. I hope you remember what I said. Let me meet my guy soon. Modamamba Fashions welcomes you to the inauguration of their new store! At Duddikonda on the main road of Araku, newly inaugurated Modamamba Fashions! Modamamba Fashions! Latest designs are available for kids and adults at low prices! Modamamba Fashions! Hey, give me the 12-number spanner. Look at that side. Hey, we have so many mills to take care of. Why are you into this clothes store now? But Satya doesn’t come to the mill. Shut up! I heard that. You are my only son. Of course, I know what you are up to and who you are looking at. Beauty is enough to fall in love with a girl. But to marry, her status matters. Brother, a recharge for 199. Sure. Tell me the number. -Nine, zero… -Brother, a recharge of 99. It’s urgent, brother. Please give her first, brother. Tell me the number. Hey, pass! Hey, Raghu! Hey, are you playing cards or chess? Why are you taking so long for each round? What? You fleeced 1,500 off me yesterday. I won’t let you win today. I own the innings. Will you discard or should I close? Wait! Don’t disturb me! Hey, Murali, why don’t you replace him? -I don’t know how to play, brother. -What? But yesterday you said you knew? I am joking. Even he doesn't know how to play! He is counting stars while holding cards in his hand. Uncle, don’t confuse me. I won’t play. Oh! Don’t say that. -We are already short of hands. -That’s better. -Hey, wake me up after he drops a card. -Uncle, wait… I heard you have a new tenant girl upstairs. All the boys are whispering. Why don’t you forget the cards and try your luck with her? Hey, don’t laugh. I will gorge your eyes out and make an omelet. Hey, Murali, this is not their cup of tea. You should try. I am sure she will fall for you. He doesn’t look at girls. -He only hears them. -What? We watch videos and fall in love, right? He listens to the radio and falls in love. What if the audio is hit, but the video is a flop? He will keep it at home and listen to it. -The cake is here! -Yay! Why do you want a camera phone? -You know Padma, right? -Padma? She used to roam around with a runny nose. She inaugurated a cell phone shop in Araku the other day. Hey, Chitti. You just took one. Give it to Pandu. -One minute. -Hey, Bujji! Why is it on your face? Ants will find their way. -Hello. -Hello, it’s me. You called me for the measurements. I told you it was by mistake! Why are you calling me repeatedly? Oh, it’s not that. -Please, listen to me… -Who are you talking to? Dad, no one. Customer care. Come. Let’s go. We are getting late. Come. Let’s all sit here… Chitti! Will you sit here? -Cake was great. Right? -Come. Let’s have food. Come. Are you sleepy, sweetheart? What was I saying? Yes, Padma! -Do you know how Padma became popular? -No. -By making reels. -So? -Are you going to make videos now? -Yes. She lip-syncs on someone else’s songs. But I can sing on my own. I will be more popular than her. Yes. My sister is Goya Seshal. Shut up, monkey. She really sings well. Come on, sing. Not now. I said, sing! -Sister! Please, sing, sister. -Please! -Sing, Satya. -Okay. Radha waits for Krishna On the banks of Yamuna While her love-filled Golden complexion, loses luster The night has passed And so has the day But Krishna doesn’t turn up Without the companion There is no bond of love in companionship In the absence of Krishna Radha’s heart is filled with anguish Poor Radha! -Yay! -Yay! Sister sang so well! The song is over. Shall we play a small game now? -What game? -What game? Riddles! -Okay! -Okay! It is tall at birth but short at death. What is it? Do you know what it is? -What is it? -I don’t know either. -What could it be? -No idea. Is it the eraser? No, maybe a pencil. Candle! Satya, you are not just an expert at singing but at riddles as well! Sister-in-law, ask us one more. You cut it but don’t eat it. What is it? Sister, is it cake? Not the cake. We just cut it and ate it too. Cards! Cards! You rock! Dear, Satya! I will ask you a riddle. Will you solve it? What is it? The place where all ladies meet, but has a male name. Beneath the abyss, where several sweets meet, is water full of salt! Solve it! What is it? Has a new breeze found Its way to a strange place? -Who is it? -No one. Bored heavily, has it Brought along the news to share? What could be the story That entertains? Is there a new number that connects? Is it bringing along a bundle of smiles? What could be the story That entertains? Did you solve the riddle, teacher? You gave it to me just now. Let me think, Murali. How can teachers take so long to think? Did you find the answer? If I could find the answer, would I be working here, Murali? You are ready with the punch lines though. Friends and neighbors tease and taunt In response and consent A smile appears Heart rejoices As the household chores are done But until the job is done Where is the time to spare? Hey, no exhaustion, no weariness They have no place in activeness Minutes melt chasing her Slowly through the day What could be the story That entertains? Sister! Do this as well. Dad asked you to do it. DATTATREYA MOBILE RS. 7,190/- Mom! Sister is hitting me… -Will the wind grow into a storm? -Enough. Or will the raindrops die as droplets? -Please hurry! -Yes… You gave me your rickshaw at the right moment. But until you drown It never tells you its fathom Do dreams seek permission From eyes before they settle in the heart? -Will tomorrow bury -Dad! -All the flaws of yesterday? -Study. -You sleep more. -What could be the story That entertains? MODAMAMBA FASHIONS DUDDIKONDA, ARAKU One minute. Please, give way. Hey, my sister should go in first. If I don't take your sister’s picture, who would know that she was the first one to enter? Why? You think none of us can take a selfie? -Sister, please cut the ribbon. -Mom. Farmlands and rice mills. This cloth business now. You hold Goddess Lakshmi in your almirah. When will you lock her up though? I mean, when will you get Chinni married? We may wish for many things… But we must find the right girl. -Great, Chinni. Tremendous! -Thanks, sir. Yes, Chinni. It’s really good. -I will take these two. -Please collect them at the counter. Please, show me that. Hey! Take pictures of the customers as well. Should I capture everyone? That'll be a waste of memory! -I’ll show you who to capture. Come. -Okay. -That one. -Isn’t it nice? That girl in pink. Did you turn off the flash? Will the picture come out? Why don’t you shoot? Do it. Don’t get angry, man. It’s nice, right? Four hundred. Discount. Son’s charity with his mother’s money! We will have to close the shop down if we offer such huge discounts. People don’t seem to realize their place these days. Shouldn’t they know the difference between those who sell saris worth 3,000 and those who stitch blouses for thirty rupees? Of course, they should. However expensive a sari is, no one wears it without a blouse. Sure! Who hasn’t heard that empty vessels make the most noise? First, get your daughter married. Don’t wait for some stupid rich kid to come along and take the bait. Let’s go, dear. Mom, what was that? Heartburn! What? Why are you fuming? My heart burns. What happened? Who does Chinni’s mom think she is? If you are rich, can you say anything and get away? She is arrogant because she is rich. Adding years does not make you mature! I have no idea what happened. But the way you are taking your anger out on me… No amount of money can buy this feeling. But why am I telling you all this? Happiness is shared with everyone. But anger? We express it only before our dear ones. My mom used to tell me. Really? Okay. But why did you call me? Oh, vanilla. That’s the answer to the riddle, right? This is your thirteenth awful answer. Oh, this is wrong too? -It’s okay. I am still happy being wrong. -Why? If I get the right answer, I won’t have a reason to call you. Very smart! Hey, Naughty Navya! You are so naughty in your reels. Why do you act so tough here? This is my favorite reel. Take a look. He should never get old. Don’t wait until I get old. Okay? You won't find a bus at this time. Where do you want to go? Hey, driver! Did they call you? This is a rickshaw. I don't wait for someone to call. I must ask someone if they want a ride. Hey, are you trying to be over-smart? If I take a swing, you'll get old right now. Shall we go? Thanks a lot. Call me when you need a ride. -My number is written behind -Okay. I do my homework at school itself. What about you? I do it at home. You can stop here. My house is close by. -I will go, bye! -Bye! -I am going to the farm. -Okay. Hey, Divya! Stop! -Stop! -Mom! -Mom! -Divya! -Mom… -Why do you run when I ask you to stop? -What happened? -Mom, it’s Dad! You… -Oh, no! -Mom! Stop it! What’s wrong? Why are you out to kill her? You are asking me? Ask her! Who was he? Who dropped you on the cycle? Wait. Speak! He was a brother from class tenth, Mom. My legs were hurting. So, I came on his bicycle, Mom. That’s very wrong! What would everyone think when they see you on a stranger’s bicycle? I have been asking you to buy me a bicycle. My legs hurt after walking ten kilometers every day. How much would a bicycle cost? Whatever the cost, we will have to borrow money. Mom! What is this? Ask him to buy a bicycle for her. But you saved this money for a phone. There is no hurry. I can buy it later. Oh, God! Too many fight scenes! That’s why I refuse to go to NTR’s films. Wow! As if there are no fights in your Mahesh Babu’s films. Of course, there are. Fights in his films are a part of the story. But in your guy’s films, we must look for a story in between the fights. Get lost! You are jealous of his dancing. Police are here. Put on your uniform! -Show your license. -Stop the vehicle, stop! Okay! Go. Come to the station tomorrow and pick it up. Go. -It’s urgent, sir! -RC? -Can’t get that far. -Stop talking! Leave it for now. Hey, are they passengers? Sisters, sir. Where are you coming from? We are returning from a late-night show, sir. -Okay. Do you have all the papers? -Yes, sir. Okay! Go. Stop! Did you notice his roving eye? Like an owl! You are to be blamed. You insisted on a late-night show. This is how they look at girls when we come out at this hour. If girls don't step out at this time, then they will keep the late-night shows only for men, right? Anyway, why this gender discrimination? We should do what we want. Uncle! Girls live here. You have a toilet inside, right? This is an old habit, man. Sister! -Sister, come here once. -What is it? -Sister, I want to show you something! -Where to? -Tell me where! -Come with me first! I was asking you! What sort of cleaning is that? Do it properly. That’s what I am doing, madam. Dry out the clothes once you are done. So? Is your mother-in-law’s eye surgery done? Where are you going? Sister, come along! Where are you going? Who will do the remaining work? I will break your legs. -See how she ignores me! -I know. -Chinni, it’s Satya. -Wait! I’m coming. Hey, why don’t you wait? Wait… MODAMAMBA FASHIONS -It looks great, right? -Not bad. Anyone would look beautiful on a giant poster. Hey! Are you jealous of my sister? Why would I be? Satya, did he tell you he was going to put up the hoarding? Probably, he took your dad’s permission. Look! What is that? You are not able to see her in my heart. So I put her up on the billboard. Maidanam, start the car. Your father told me that you like Satya. Why would I reject you, Chinni? If you think your mother won’t go against your word, then you can come. We will talk. After all, we are poor people. You may fall in love. But we end up taking the blame. Don’t look at me like that, baby. You're making me blush. If I can’t even look at you, then why meet? Don't sit there gawking! Are you going to eat me up? What are you doing, Pandu? It’s 12 now! Want to… Tell me. Brother, you forgot your mouth spray here. Is it okay? Not just the spray. It’s okay even if I forget to brush my teeth. There is so much distance here. What is this, baby? I am right beside you, but you are busy on the phone! Beside me? You are a kilometer away! What? You are saying something? She can’t even hear what I am saying! Why come all the way for this? Waste of petrol! Okay, baby. I will leave. She will bite me if I delay more. Let us meet next Sunday, okay? We can happily chat for a long time. Again? Sunday? Happily? Whatever! Baby, get fritters next time. Hello! How long, brother? You are so lost in romance, you don’t even notice the time! Damn this life! What took you so long? Sorry… When you find someone, I will accompany you just like this. Wait. Just a minute. What now? Did you find the answer to the riddle? This is your last chance. If the answer is wrong again, I will never take your call. Hello, I am Murali’s sister. My brother keeps talking about you. We know everything. Oh, no. There's nothing like that. I happened to dial the wrong number. But I never called him after that. Why don’t you? He will be elated if you call him. He drives the rickshaw day and night for us. I don’t know if he told you. But he is very fond of you. -Padma! -Yes? Can I get my phone back? We will call you again. Don’t let him know we called. -Give me once. -One minute. Don’t forget to call him, okay? Why are we still here? Let's go. Who was that on the phone? You refuse to give me your phone these days. And you are always on the phone! What’s the matter? Kannaya, you tell me. Should I call him or not? Look at you! You smile at everything. What happened? Did you dial the wrong number again? No. I called you. Oh! It might rain today. So, tell me, Mr. Murali. What's up? How did you know my name? -I came to know everything about you. -Like what? I know who you are and what you do. Okay, where are you? I came to the hospital. Hospital? What happened? You know everything. Don’t you know this? Your sister didn’t tell me. Oh, so you spoke to my elder sister? -Murali! -Be on the line, please. The doctor said I must stay at the hospital for two days. Okay. -Money… -It’s okay. Give me later. -Call me if you need anything. -Okay. Hello! So, free service? Sometimes. What else did my sister say? Only this much. But don’t question them. What? You are supporting them already? Nothing. Okay, fine. Bye. Hello! When will you call me again? When I feel like it. Yes. But when will you feel like it? I will call you when I want to call. I am hanging up. It’s always me who's calling you… I lost all hope of you ever calling me. That’s why… this is a once-in-a-blue-moon call. I'm unable to disconnect. If you want me to call you again, you'll have to cut the call, right? As the dove of my heart Opens its new wings On the magnolia Of my lips intertwines a smile On my way as I move along Listening to cool breeze songs Like a sweet message Sent by you it makes my day every day As I remember your words all of a sudden I stay in one place lost to the world As your thoughts greet me every moment My body longs to reach you in earnest As the dove of my heart Opens its new wings On the magnolia Of my lips intertwines a smile On my way as I move along Listening to cool breeze songs Like a sweet message Sent by you it makes my day every day Why are you looking me up on Facebook? -I want to see you. -You want to see me? -I want to see you, meet you. -And you become my shadow in it all You paint pictures by the dusk As dreams close my eyes, you arrive -By the way, are you on WhatsApp? -Shall I call it a distance familiar -or a heaviness unknown? -My phone is not compatible with WhatsApp. One minute. Shall I be a step in your step As I walk with you in sync? -Yes, tell me? -Why don’t you buy a camera phone? -They are quite cheap now. -Yes. I must. -How much? -Seven thousand five hundred. As the dove of my heart Opens its new wings On the magnolia Of my lips intertwines a smile -On my way as I move along listening -What? Is he calling you every day? -To cool breeze songs -His voice sounds so good. -Like a sweet message sent by you -What’s in a voice? It makes my day every day -Did you pack the sample blouse? -Yes. Aunty, this design suits you. The design is lovely, but it doesn’t suit my age, Satya. As your thoughts greet me every moment My body longs to reach you in earnest As the dove of my heart Opens its new wings On the magnolia Of my lips intertwines a smile On my way as I move along Listening to cool breeze songs Like a sweet message sent by you It makes my day every day Modamamba fair is coming up in our village. Will you come? I will come, not for the fair. But just to see you. Hey! Brother, please come inside! My mother is unconscious. She needs to go to the hospital. Mom! Brother! Please, drive fast. Brother, please drive fast. Hello, are you sleeping? Sorry. I was coming to you. But I had to stop because of a hospital case. I was looking forward to seeing you. Anyway, it’s not that important. Don’t say that! You texted me that you wanted to tell me something. What is it? I will tell you in the morning. Okay. I don't know what to do. I am scared. They are talking about marriage. I want to tell them I am not interested. But I'm too scared to say that to my dad. Satya! Why do you worry? Just go and sit. Meeting prospective matches does not mean anything. You said she made a big scene in the shop the other day. Do you think she will budge now? Who knows? Naidu told me they were coming right now. There. They are here already. I am not even ready. -Are they already here? -Yes. -Greetings. -Greetings. Let’s go. Satya! Are you ready? -Have you made tea? -It’s boiling. Her face doesn’t show that she is in favor. You should look at Chinni’s face when he hears Satya’s name. It was glowing! Do you think something is going on between Satya and Chinni? Even if there is, let us pretend we don’t know. Please, have it. All this is not necessary. We need laborers at the mill. Since your house is close by, I came to tell you. Pay him the wages. After spending so much today, they might not have enough to buy food. If I don’t turn up at your mill, your work will stop. But my house will run, even if you don’t give me work. I was scared she might say yes. What are you saying? Have you gone mad? Not mad. I am in love. How can you love someone you didn’t see? You don’t seem to understand. This is madness. They fled as soon as they saw you? Do you look so terrible? Hello, mister, there's a hoarding with my photo on it in our village. Understand? Really? Are you so beautiful? No. They used my photo to show they can correct uneven teeth and blunt noses. I know it is not true. I can feel you look beautiful. Why don’t you send me a photo? I asked you to meet me, but you were busy doing social service. Fine. I will definitely make it next time. Tell me where to come. Not you. I will come myself. I promised Kannaya I will visit the Iskcon temple if this alliance fails. Okay, but tell me this… Chinni has money and property. What is your objection? Don’t you know? Tell me. I don’t care what he has… I want to be with you. Why do you like me so much? You like me and I like that. Okay. When are you coming to Vizag then? Very soon. Will you show me the beach then? What? You have never been to a beach till now? Long ago when I was a kid. I am crazy about beaches. What about me? Hey, stupid! I have already told you! Fine. I will call you back. I got a ride. What? Are you upset? No. I will call you before going to bed. Hey, will you show me the beach or not? Not just the beach. I will show you the entire city. Okay? Satya. -Satya! -Yes, Mom? Coming! My mom is calling. I will call you back. Hello, Satya… -Bye. -Hello… I thought you will go on a hunger strike because I rejected the girl. New rice? Yes. From our own farm. Mom! We have such a big house, mills, and farmlands. What are all they for? What do you mean? They are all for you so that you will never have to work hard and just be happy. My happiness is not in all of them. It has a name. Satya. I don’t want Satya against your wish. But I can never be happy without her. I hope your sister won’t go back on her word. My sister only sounds harsh. But once she gives her word, it is as good as a promissory note. Okay, then. Your daughter is very lucky, Mr. Tatarao! -See you. -Let’s go! I take your leave. Sweetheart! You are very lucky! You found such an amazing match. I am going to be busy from today. Bye, brother! Go inside. Quick. Hello! Satya! Are you there? Why don’t you speak? Chinni convinced his mother. They are getting ready for our engagement. What did you say? Who asked me? They decided on their own. Murali, we need to meet. There is no time. Where can we meet? Will you come here? If someone sees us, it might create a problem. Do something, Murali. Okay. Don’t panic. Everything will go as we want. Let me think and call you back. Okay? Okay. Will you start the work tomorrow? I'll finish my job at Karakavalasa tomorrow. -I can start the work here the day after. -Here. Two thousand as advance. Use thicker paint. It should last long. Girls hesitate to get into a rickshaw alone. But you are ready to live with a rickshaw driver you've never met! Delete his number and marry Chinni. You will lead a happy life. I love him. You are crazy. Yes, I am crazy. I can’t even sleep unless I hear his voice. Satya, don’t do this, please. Why can't we just call them up? Do we have to invite them in person? You want to invite our closest relatives over the phone? She's just getting engaged. We'll have to personally go over to invite them to the wedding anyway. I know what to do. Where are the kids? -Are they ready? Satya… -They are getting ready. Satya! Dad! I am ready. I am not well, Dad. Please, carry on without me. Divya, stay with your sister. Mom, I want to come along. Please, Mom. I want to see Chitti. Please, Mom! Take her along, Dad. Lakshmi will stay with me. Okay, fine. Be careful, okay? We will be back the day after. -Okay, come. -Come. There is curd in the kitchen. Make yourself some buttermilk. If we had asked him, our son-in-law would have sent us a car. The wedding is yet to take place, and you are dreaming of cars. Come! You make it sound so easy. But my heart is racing. Lakshmi is here. I will call you later. Come, let’s eat. Do you want a pickle? Hello, do you want a pickle? No. Here, have this. I am going to Vizag tomorrow. Vizag? For what? To meet Murali. Oh, God! If my mom asks me, what would I tell her? Please, don’t. Listen to me. -Satya. -Hello. Satya! Satya… the power is out! I am scared. I am not able to sleep under this stress. You will come to the bus stand in the morning, right? I will come. The first bus is at 5:30 a.m. I will take that. Satya! Come and sleep. You have to leave early in the morning. Okay, see you. Good night. Okay, bye. Do you hear me? Come and sleep. You are going to meet a boy for the first time. Is this dress okay? I don’t know what to ask you in all this hurry. But you know what to give me. Take care of Bujji until I return. Hello, I have left. Have you? Hello, I can’t hear you. I am driving! It is raining heavily here. I can’t hear anything. I will call you once I reach there. Hello, I will call you back. Wait. Why is it raining so badly? -Call me once you reach. -Yes. Right! -Here’s your ticket to Pendurthi. -Okay. Ticket! Are you done admiring the rain? Take the ticket. Brother, one ticket to Vizag. Vizag… You won’t get change for five hundred on the bus. Ask for it at the bus stand. I will sign the ticket. Show me when you get off. Okay? Oh, child! -Did you board at Duddikonda? -Yes. I am coming to Tagarapuvalasa today. I want my money back. Madam! Pay the money. Hello, Murali! What happened to you? Why are you not answering your phone? Where are you? Have you come to Vizag or not? Why don’t you speak? I am in the ladies' toilet. Hey, come out! Who is inside? How long will it take? Come out fast. How can you take so long? Come out fast! Are you coming? -Stay on the call. -Don’t you hear me? -I am coming out. -Come out! I am wearing a yellow dress. Do you hear me? Don't you understand? Are you coming? Murali? I was really scared when you didn’t answer the phone. I am thirsty. Don’t be tense. Meanwhile, I will send Suri home. Both of you go to the station. Hey, give me two water bottles. Here. Forty rupees. Don’t you have chilled ones? One minute. Make it fast. Here! -You have nothing colder than this? -No. There was no power all night. Then why do you sell them, man? Look. Buy them or don’t. But don’t disrespect me. You want respect, do you? Respect! -Hey, who are you? Why are you hitting me? -Hey, come here! Are you a goon? Will you strike me? You dare step into my area and manhandle me? -Don’t talk too much! -Hey! -You have a slippery tongue. -Hey, why did you hit me? Don’t act crazy. I will kill you! Oldster! Bloody… -Come, rascal! -He took out a knife! Why did you take out a knife? Hey! Hey… this is a shop! Hey! Hey! Who the heck are you? Hey! Hey, start the vehicle. Start the vehicle! I won't spare you. I will come for you. RK, what's the matter? Nothing, sir. Nothing. Let’s go. What is this, RK? You broke more bottles than him! Do you want a hole in your head? You run a shop. Don’t you know water should be chilled? What, Mr. Raju? How are you? Oh, RK! How come you are here? What is a fair without me, Mr. Raju? I believe you taught someone a big lesson at the soda shop this morning. The whole village is talking about it. Look, settle the loan with Simhachalam. He is not a good man. I will pay him as soon as I get a job. Careful! Don’t get involved in every issue. Come on, sir. Come on. Test your luck. You won't regret it. What combination! How lucky! Come, sir. Please, come. 20 for 10. 40 for 20. 80 for 40. What an offer! Come on! I am doing it. I am taking it out. -I got ripped off again. -Come on, sir. Please, come. -All lost! -On Chiranjeevi… -We have nothing left to play! -Don't delay. Bloody! My fifty on Balakrishna… Did you make anything? How can I? He wiped me clean. Do you have any money on you? What an offer! Come on! -Wait! Don’t flip it. -Come on! -I have fifty. -That's enough! Give it. Here, brother. My twenty on Mega Star. -Hey, Phani. -Yes? -Play with caution. -You bet only 50. Come on. Here, on Mega Star. We got it this time. Whose is this? Forty for twenty. Come on! Hundred for fifty. -Twenty on Nagarjuna this time. -Twenty for ten… come on! Brother, the cops are here! -Run! Run! -Catch them! Hey! -Brother, please let go. -My money? Cops are here. If they catch me, they will thrash me. -Brother, please let go. -Stop! What, RK? What are you doing here? They were gambling, sir. I will take care of them. You get going. Hey, RK! When did you come? Why are you in such a deep slumber? Did you get drunk at the fair? You live better than me, man. You do whatever you want. -Uncle, can you spare two thousand? -No, man. A thousand? Not at all, man. I lost everything in the 3-card brag last night. -Hey, Govind! -Yes. -Take 1469 out. -Okay. Spare me at least 500. Why wouldn’t I, if I had it? If I get something by evening, I will give you. Do you at least have a cigarette? Why is this guy here in the morning? -Hey… -I will be back. Hey, are you back? Where were you yesterday? Your mom was worried sick. I heard you got into a fight with someone. How can you be so irresponsible, boy? They are looking for prospective matches for the girl. If you keep yourself busy with your loans and fights. They will marry her off to someone else. Your half-education won’t get you a job. So, find some work. What? Do you hear me? No work and all play. Always wandering around. She's getting on my nerves! Where did you find her? Hey, she is my mom! Did you win the game last night? -Yes, I got five hundred. -Only five hundred? How much did we invest? Fine, give it to me. I paid for my drinks last night. Hey, wait. I will come along. By the way, what happened at the interview yesterday? I got the job. -But I told them I am not interested. -But why? Who would work for twenty thousand? It’s month-long slavery. But it’s a good salary! I break my back painting, yet I don’t make so much! There's a job that gets you a lakh every two days, you know? -One lakh? What job is that? -Chain snatching. But we can’t do such things. I will do anything for money. RK! Cigarette… Go to work, first. Hey! Stop the bus! What is this daily headache? Get down and check on him. Get on the bike. I won’t. Mind your own business. What? Are you seriously angry? Why don’t you answer my calls? You rejected a job, didn’t you? What do you want from me? Okay. Give me five hundred. I need it for fuel. I don’t have any. You were so different in college. Look at you now! NARSIPATNAM TO TANDAVA JN -Good morning, teacher! -Good morning. Why are you here? I told you I need money. I don’t have any. What are you doing? RK, kids are watching. Leave my hand! Let them watch and learn. Leave my hand, RK! You have fattened up. It won't come off. Hey! Are you not ashamed to use force? What to do? You were not like this in college either. You would give me whatever I asked for. Hey, if you don’t find a job soon, my dad will marry me off to some guy. Your choice. If he is good enough, marry him. As if he will be a hindrance for us! Damn you! GANG SELLING GIRLS ARRESTED RK… shall we go? -How much? -Two thousand. So, only girls are valuable. Not their jewelry. Pour me some! You had no money this morning. And now you are throwing a party. You are super, boy. Tell me. You have an interview tomorrow. Have you prepared? Just like you, they’ll also come up with routine questions. What's there to prepare? Are you drinking? Why? You want to join me? Miss this job, and I won’t even look at your face again. Teachers are too difficult to handle! I suggested you change the brand. Hey, he is talking about the girl. Raja Sekhar? Hello! What happened? Did you get the job? Yes, I got it. I'll collect the salary in the evening and come to see you. Hey, tell me what… You… Cut the call. I will call you after the interview. Hello! Who is it, sir? Girlfriend? No, your sister. Rama Krishna? -Sekhar, right? -Yes! -Is the interview done? -Yes. Okay, come. Let’s discuss the matter. Matter? What matter? What? Don’t you know you must greet me when you come in? Sorry. Should I go out and come in again? Oh! Not bad. You are full of sarcasm! Because I have no job, sir. Your qualification is not so bad. Why didn’t you get a job till now? I got it, sir. But I refused it because I didn’t like the pay. We pay quite well. But we also receive lots of applications. To prioritize you out of so many, you must give us something, right? What do you want, sir? Don’t get angry. You have understood the issue. If you want 40,000 as your monthly salary, you must deposit four lakhs. Single-time investment. A job in the hospitality industry settles you for life. You don’t have to look back. Call me anytime once the money is ready. All the best! Do you have an extra cigarette, brother? This is the last one, brother. Do you mind sharing? Are you here for the interview? Yes, brother. Did he ask you for money? Worse than that, brother. They want me to introduce good-looking girls to them. They say if the girl is fixed, the job is free. Really? Who would do such a thing for a job? You have to do it if you want something. Hey! Why do you throw it? Fifteen rupees. Give it here. -So? Is it done? -No. They will give me a job if I pay them four lakhs or supply girls. We can’t pay them. What are you going to do? I am thinking about it. But it’s a good job. I can settle down. In that case… Do one thing. Go and meet Saidulu. -He is the right man for these things. -Okay. The customer you are calling is unavailable at the moment. Please try after some time… Here! Beware of pickpockets. The number you have dialed is currently busy. Please try later. Please try after some time -Catch him. -Don’t hit me. Don’t! -Please! Don’t hit me. -My phone, brother! Pickpocketing is wrong! Brother, my phone! I dropped my phone, brother! Give me the phone. What happened, bro? I lost my phone, brother. Brother, can you lend me your phone? The number you are calling is switched off. Hello, Murali! What happened to you? Hey, come out! Hello, Murali! -Hey, come out! -The number you dialed is currently busy. Did you hear me or not? -Can't you hear me? Come out! -The number you've dialed is busy. Hello, Murali! Can you hear me? Are you coming? Murali? I was scared when you didn’t answer my call. I am thirsty. Mark my entry, sir. I will go. -The server’s down. -You always have some excuse. Brother, has the first bus from Araku arrived? Yes. I was the conductor of that bus. What happened? -Have you lost something? -No, brother. A girl got in at Duddikonda. She must be around 19 or 20. -Is she fair? -Yes. I saw her go that way, boss. -Try and call her. -I lost my phone, brother. Use mine and call. I don’t know her number. How can you not remember important numbers? -I will call on my number and see. -Yes. The number you are calling is currently switched off. She was right here, boss. -Did you connect the call? -No, brother. It was ringing. Now it is switched off. Someone stole it. Let’s go further and check. Do you at least remember her dress color? Not so well, boss. There… that’s the girl. She is in a yellow dress. -Okay, thank you, brother. -Fine. Satya! You were mistaken. I wanted to tell you earlier. I came to hand over the phone. You are Murali, right? Yes. And you are? I found your phone. He answered your phone. I thought it was you. It’s okay. Forget about it. I feel suffocated here. Can we go out? Okay. Moving towards you and only you Only when I reach you Only when I reach you My feet shall rest As long as I walk towards you It doesn’t matter where I move to As a blindfold slips away from eyes No milestones can keep you hidden Moving towards you Only when I reach you Shall we go somewhere? What makes you so bold? I have no answer to this question What happened to your timidness? Ask me and I have no answer I hid my wings within For this day To touch the stars With you one day For the first time since I got off the bus this morning, I'm feeling calm. Really? Maybe you feel at home here. You have a beautiful smile. When are you taking me to the beach? We can go in the evening. The sea looks the best in the evening. Shall we take a selfie? Murali… He is the guy who returned your phone, right? I think he is following us. Okay. Let’s leave. Come. He will follow us wherever we go. Let’s confront him. Murali, no. -Listen to me. -It's okay. He is coming. I will call you back. What is it, brother? What is happening? Exactly what I want to ask you. What’s happening? Why are you following us, brother? Why are you touching me? Are you a hero? It’s not that, brother. Why are you following us? Remove your hand! Murali! -He is the one who is following us! -Let’s leave. Come! Let us go! Murali! Don’t fight. Murali! Satya! Satya. Brother, what happened? -Move. Move aside. -Give way. Move! -What is going on? -They were fighting, sir. The other guy just left, sir. He pushed the girl, sir. Okay. We will take care. You guys leave. Where are you from, brother? Narsipatnam, sir. Why did you come here? I came for an interview, sir. Then you should mind your own business. Why get into fights? Go. -Get going. All of you! -Leave. -This isn't a circus! Move. -Get going. -Leave! -Move it! Go on. Do we have to tell you specifically? Move! Hey, boy! Move! -When will you pay the money? -I will give you. Wait for two days. I won! Why should I wait? -I am regular. Why are you so rude? -You were the same when you won! Do it fast. It’s almost time. Brother, it’s you! How are you? When was that? Where are you right now? I'll be there in fifteen minutes. This is nice, right? This color looks good on you. What happened? Are you hurt? It’s okay. That’s nothing. Pack this, brother. Also, give me a T-shirt in my size. He has beaten you quite badly. You are bleeding. -Shall we go to the hospital? -Not necessary. Which way did he go? -That way. -Come. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? I was, but not anymore. Cut the call, Vasu. I will call you back. Brother, did they escape? I won't rest until I smack that rascal. Fine. Shall we have drinks? My friend’s bar is nearby. I can’t simply let him go. You know me well. They may not have gone too far. They must be roaming somewhere here. I will take care. Come on. I’ll freshen up. We have come only to freshen up. That’s all. Is that all? Give me your shirt. Let me wash it. Okay. What is it? I got you water, brother. -How are you? -I am good, brother. Call me, in case you need something. I'll be downstairs. I think he escaped, Saidulu. You should have bashed him up right there, brother. A crowd had gathered. The cops came too. Freshen up. I will get something to eat. Come fast. Lock the door. Do you have cigarettes? No, sir! You will get them from the nearby shop. Okay. I will go get the cigarettes. Hello, Lakshmi! Hello! Hey, stupid! Where the hell were you? Why didn’t you answer the phone? It’s a long story. I will tell you later. Okay. Did you meet him? Yes, I did. How does he look? He looks great. Really? Is he with you? No. He has just gone out. Out? Where are you now? I am in a lodge. Hey! How can you stay in a lodge? What are you up to? Are you mad? Oh, God, don’t panic. Nothing as you think. I slipped in sludge, and my clothes got dirty. I am here for a change of clothes. A lot more happened. But I will tell you when I come back. Okay. Be careful. You are returning by the evening bus, right? My mom already asked about you. What did you tell her? I told her you went to Araku to buy a matching blouse. Hello! Satya, are you there? Hello, Satya! Lakshmi! Did you take my phone again? Sister-in-law, I am here. Hello! Satya? Yes. Who are you? Where is Murali? He has just gone out. Let me call him up. Brother, rickshaw. -Can you take me to S K lodge? -Where? S K lodge. SHIVA Saidulu, I just saw him. Come! -Hey, I will pay you later. -Sure, brother. -Did you see which way he went? -Into that lane. Shiva is written on the back of his rickshaw. Sister, when did you come? -It’s been a while. -Really? But what is this, Murali? Sister, what happened? What happened to your phone? Oh, that? Where shall I begin? Did you speak to my sister? She didn’t say anything. She is my sister, Savitri. Very close to me. She owns this lodge. The girl is beautiful. Your selection is always great, Murali. By the way, both of you are leaving for Bhogapuram today, right? Where to? -Sister, can you step out? -It’s not that, Murali… -What happened? -Come. I will explain. -Murali! -Sister, please come out! Come. I will explain. Let go of my hand. Why did you come here? To meet you. Lower your voice. He has pestered me with phone calls. I called you a hundred times. It’s either not reachable or switched off. Why didn't you answer the phone at the bus stand? No matter where you go, you will finally end up here. That’s why I came here. I can’t take her to Bhogapuram now. I'll take her at the right time. What? Are you trying to act smart? You took the money. Remember? I remember everything. I will do things when I should. Get going now. Call him and tell him not to bother me. Call him now! I think we are out of petrol. Send another vehicle. Make it fast! I think it is Gandhinagar. Yes. There! That’s the one. Hey, it has started. Hop on! -Hey, stop! -Stop! Brother, the last guy who got into your rickshaw. -Where did you drop him? -S K Lodge. S K Lodge! Send him some photographs. He is getting impatient! I beg you. Leave now! Hey, the girl is very tender. Don’t mess with her. Go now. My sister is cranky. She keeps saying things. Why didn’t you eat? Why are we going to Bhogapuram? Bhogapuram… There was no such plan. My sister was mistaken. My sister didn’t know we both met for the first time today. I must go, Murali. Drop me at the bus stand. So soon? I must leave. Drop at the bus stand. -You didn’t even eat anything. -It’s okay. You can go after eating. I am not hungry. Hey, I want you to eat. -You can go after eating. -I want to go home, Murali. You can go after eating. Sit. Sit down. What is it now? You want to go to the bus stand, right? Satya… look here. You want to go to the bus stand, right? Okay. I will take you. We will leave in a while. Okay? How long have we been waiting for this day? Why do you say you want to leave? Leave me, Murali. Let me go, Murali. Satya, listen to me. Let go, Murali! It hurts. Does it? Why are you pushing me away then? I said we will leave in a while! Didn’t I tell you we will leave in a while? Satya… Satya… it’s not that. Once… Satya, listen to me. Satya! Satya, one… Hey! Leave me, Murali. Satya, why are you so scared? Satya! S… Satya, we will leave… We will leave in a while. Satya! What is it now? Same problem. -Listen, where is S K Lodge? -On the right over there. Hey! I said we will leave in a while. Why are you biting me? Hey! Don’t shout. Move, you bloody… Where is he? Where is he? Keep quiet. I will kill you if you shout. Where is the girl? Speak up! Where is she? Why do you care? Is she your sister? Who are you all? What’s going on here? A fight is going on. You want to watch it? Who allowed them inside? Who are you trying to call? Cops? Do you know the area CI, Das? Should I give you his number? Tell me. Where did you hide her? I won’t tell you. Tell me where she is. Say it, bloody idiot! Tell me! Speak! Open the door, Satya. -Saidulu, are you there? -Yes. Open the door. Open the door, Satya. Satya! Open the door! If you don’t, I am going to break it down. Don’t be afraid. You are out of harm’s way now. A recharge of 199. -90-- -Brother, a recharge of 99. It's urgent, brother. Give her first, brother. -Tell me the number, dear. -9247… 0033… Call me when you need a ride. My number is written behind. When I found his phone, he received a call… Hello, Murali! Has Satya arrived? Is she with you now? How does she look? Will we make good money? The businessman from Bhogapuram is getting restless. Hey, why don’t you respond? Murali! Did you hear me or not? I understood his plan then. That’s why I followed you both. How is she? Okay? Give her the phone once. Talk. -Hello… -Hello, hi! I am Vasundhara. What is your name? Being a girl, I understand how you must be feeling right now. It’s easy to reassure you from here. But only you would know the pain you have gone through. Consider this an accident. Why are you not saying anything? Okay. Please give the phone to RK. Tell me. Tell me, sir. Are you relaxed now? You were so worried about her. You can’t bear to see people in trouble, right? That’s why I love you so much. I am proud of you, RK. You asked me not to show you my face if I don’t get the job. Hey, Vasu! Coffee! What’s in a job? You will get it one day. First, you come here. I want to see you right now. Would you like to eat something? Don’t be shy. Tell me what it is. Can you take me to the beach? Okay. Brother, beach. You trusted him a lot, right? We can forget love. But not the betrayal by those we love. You are too young. You have no idea… but this is how the real world is, behind a mask. You can’t even trust those you see every day. With strangers, it is all the more difficult. People and problems come and go in life… just like the sea waves. If we falter, they take us back with them. Stand strong, and they will touch you and go away. It’s time for the bus. Shall we go? Not every acquaintance brings trouble. Not every friendship ends in betrayal. Yet, a girl like Satya becomes news in the paper every two days. When the phones we carry are getting smarter and smarter… How smart should we be? The gang using Facebook and mobile to trap girls has been nabbed. The police say that there are many out there who pretend to be nice to trap girls. Police have warned us to beware of calls and messages from unknown numbers and be wary of building friendships with strangers. This is Deepti with cameraman Rajesh for TV5. A FEW MONTHS LATER Mr. Chinni. Please WhatsApp me the sari designs once they're in stock. Okay. Satya… Everyone at home is waiting for your decision. I will tell you at the right time. -We are all here anyway. -Okay.
