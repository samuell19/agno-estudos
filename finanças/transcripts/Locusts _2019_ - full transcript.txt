You owe me that. OK. And now? The bait boy. Taken when he turned six. - Did you have a party? Big party, but I didn't get there. It was an important business meeting. I was waiting for you I waited all night at the bus stop like no idiot. I'm sorry. I had to go. I didn't want a reason to return to this cone. And here it is now. It's your turn. I think not. - You don't need to shoot anyone. Make some photos to get used to. Is not difficult. Do it. You're doing it wrong. Well, a long time ago! I don't like guns. Excuse me. Ari offers drinks to girls every night at two o'clock. He then has something to do. Go there and be ready. He empties the cash register and goes to the agency to count the money. This time I will deceive you. Cheers. Is it a laxative? - Sodium phosphate. It makes no sense. It's ingenious. This dose cleans up the horse. If everything goes according to plan, he leaves the office and put the money in the cash register in the desk drawer. That's when we go there. - That I just take the box and disappear? Yes, but most of the money is in the safe. Two possibilities. He has a key around his neck. Fortunately, I know the secure code. Are there surveillance cameras there? - Jake, I'll take care of it. Yes it works. Why are you going out with this? Shouldn't you be at school? They are my friends. - They're not expensive. They bite you and spit in your mouth. - What does this belong to you? Tik, tak, tik, tak. He is smart. Yes he will go. - You better come for your sake. I think you remain very smart. - what? You scare everyone in shit pants, but you just talk shit. Exciting. You are the second guy this week that took over. That second was buried a few days ago. Good appetite, piston. Jake here. Yes, hello? What is the problem? What do I have to do with dead cattle and unworthy water? We are allowed to drill on my land. How does it end? Hello? Hello! What do you have Ah, drinks. Are you a waitress? I pay you too much for serving drinks. This is the celebrity of the stadium. You came back between the rural board Be quiet, girls. Was it a hard day at the office? - There was an injury while I was driving my beard. Take a razor. Every time I see Black's boys, I think there will be problems. Unless you are interested in corporate law, you will not find me interesting. Not an apple will fall far from the tree. So you live with Jakey Anderson. What he is doing? Is he drilling oil? I don't know. It was good to talk. I see you. See him. - I'm watching you. You are also a sexy demon! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Curse. Damn it. Curse. What the hell is reeking here? Watch out for gluten. The whole city of hell stinks. The smart guy would get out of here. This city needs a huge abdominal wash. Damn it. Where did you stay so long? How much did he get? He is dead What? No. - You Satan killed him. What stinks here? - His shit stinks here! Stop, or I'll shoot you. How the hell do you dare come to my house to rob me? Give my money back. -Give that. - I don't give money. Oh damn! I should have been stolen from "Dora fucking scientist"! I know who you are. Your father was a miserable cheater. And I helped your sick son. Can I thank you for that? I know people - You took the money. Rahat. What the fuck is going on? Ari? Researchers are still while the truck driver in his direction receives treatment. According to the police, he knew nothing about the accident... $ 350, 360, 370, $ 380,000. We're in the ass. And don't be. Nobody knows we have the money. Your boss's remains are scattered across the state. The news said it was just a notable accident. Shouldn't we be like that? For me, it's the same thing that you do. I take my share and disappear. When they start to spread the word that the property is missing, they start looking. So they add two plus two. The money must be hidden. Go find your brother. Thank you, Jake. Caleb, sit still. Where's my brother? - Sit still or the next one is on your forehead. I need to meet your boss. - God... Here's what you wanted. Caleb, don't be rude. Send the guest inside. I need to check on you. Good. For Satan's sister has everything. 100,000. The total value. Where is Tyson? Relax, black. Do you want to drink? - Davo, give him a beer. This is the last one. - Give it to him, he won. I let the beer be. I want my brother and get out of here. You received the money. - Where did you get them? What does it matter? - A colleague had a bad night. A decent amount of money has disappeared from him. I don't know anything about it. It is all I have. You look like an honest guy. We had a contract. Your father was a much better liar. Your brother is not good. Tyson! Above that. Up. You seem to steal Peter in order to be able to pay him. I don't understand Think a little. You took the money. I don't know if you play poker, but nobody wants a dead man's hand. Ry, don't say anything. - Shut up! Nothing gives you a better trick than when you kill a man. Isn't it, Benny? - It's true, man. Black, now you show where the rest of the money is, or we killed your brother. The whole fucking family and that miserable prostitute whose money stole Sidewinder. Cut on everyone's neck. Ry, don't say anything. Well, what do you say, brother? Sorry for leaving you on the trail. It wasn `t fair. I knew it would only hurt you. I'm glad you left. I've always tried to keep you out of this hell. I wish you had stayed. They killed the fairy, didn't they? This shit is not going to leave us alone. They will not give up. There are such. They take everything, Ry. Down there. Shit! Where are they? On here. Come on, sissies. - It's not Satan. Raise. They were here! Hell, they were here! That's right! Curse! Keep it. - Cain... Yes, there is no money here. Breaking it happens all day. Give it here. What are you going to do? - Give it here. Davo, damn it! You have one last chance to say where the money is. Unless you tell me, there will soon be a baseball-sized hole in your occiput. This is bullshit. I shove that money into the wrinkled ass of his limb breaking limbs. Your dick of Satan will die. Tyson! Tyson! Satan. You will not die here. I'll make it. Are you ready On here. Help me. You hear? You need to get it right, Tys. Then just go straight to the pub. Do it! The devil! I said it was enough now. Ryan, get out of here. Save this. Didn't your dad say you shouldn't show up? Why did you kill my brother? - I am innocent, Your Honor. Two blacks died each week. Good result. Why are you doing this to my family? Your father arranged me for this chair. Look, Caleb. It has shit in human form. The plague. He's the last one. Find out about him. Do it. Do this, Caleb. End her day! If not, I will. Who are you What the hell are you? I wanted to hurt you. But everything is backwards. What? - You left him while he was expecting a baby. How can you do that? Izzy? Who killed my brother? So you finally learned how to use this? Jake, why did you do that? Keep this before you get hurt. That's nice. What you want to know I want to know what the problem is. Do you want to know why this country was raped for 10 years? I had to sell four generations of blood and sweat to get a hole in the floor. Yes, boy... Gasoline. For $ 2 million. Now it's in the south. Why did you kill my family? Cockroaches you are. And chicken shit. Do you have a family reunion? - Wipe the smile off your lips, dick. I have a sick child at home. Half the city is sick. You knew it was because of the drilling. My daughter is seven years old. - You would have done the same. I do not. - Well, do it then. Mom, come on. Drilling at the northwestern dam is prohibited after the survey. The situation is catastrophic for health. Hundreds may have been poisoned by chemicals. The deceased owner may have an agreement with the contract that was done with the small town drug districts. Police Chief Steven Harley: I don't want to be called a local hero but the streets are safer now that the crowd has been arrested. Take care of him. I like it. The doctor was hopeful. - good When do you have an appointment? - Early tomorrow. So nothing more than going. Why did not you tell me? You were the only one who had the opportunity to get out of here. I will refund you for everything. - You already credited. Are you okay Come on. So stay well. We will. Who is he? Todd, your brother. Do you like fishing? - what? I live in the desert.
