Did you hear? Did you hear the charges against you? I will only answer before the Grand National Assembly. Whatever your masquerade is, I don't admit these… It was your masquerade for 25 years. It was your masquerade, you brought the country to the brink of disaster. I don't want to. I do not recognize this court. Everything that was said here is false. …provocation… It's fake! This is our leader! There are 3,5 million apartments. Ten thousand factories. "I am not guilty of these charges." No! I didn't say anything! I made no statement! "I am not guilty of these charges." -No statement. -We're not making any! You're not. That's what we're taking down. No statement! I'm not making any… I'm not saying another word except before the National Assembly! Right. "I am not guilty of these charges." Please write that down. They can say whatever they want. I'm not signing anything. Yes. We know the situation. This country's disastrous situation. And we're not the only ones. Every single honest citizen living and breathing until December 22, 1989… No, now I'm talking to the defendant, Ceausescu Nicolae. Who authorized the genocide in Timisoara? Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej… …of the Popular Republic of Romania. Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu has the floor. We shall honor your memory, dear comrade Gheorghiu by strengthening the party's unity and stamina bringing the people together around the Party and its Central Committee. We will triple our efforts and work with abnegation for the unabashed accomplishment of the general Party line. We shall dedicate our lives to the cause of the people's happiness elevating our homeland to the highest peaks of Socialism, We shall fight with ever more determination for the triumph of peace, friendship among peoples, the unity of the communist movement and of workers all over the world. Goodbye beloved comrade and friend. WE THANK THE PARTY FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS FOR OUR HAPPY CHILDHOOD LONG LIVE THE 1ST OF MAY Let us make it a success working for the 4th congress! Glorious Central Committee pride and love of our city! On behalf of the Central Committee, I submit the following to the Congress: That the Romanian Workers' Party be henceforth called The Romanian Communist Party. The ongoing Congress be numbered the 9th Congress of the Communist Party. If there are other opinions on these proposals, comrades? None. Let's vote, then. Who is in favor of changing the name of our Party to the Romanian Communist Party, raise your hand. Thank you. Anyone against? Anyone abstaining? The Congress has unanimously approved changing the name of the Romanian Workers' Party to the Communist Party! GLORY TO THE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY Our people, free and in full control of its destiny, consciously building its own history, shall dedicate its strength and abilities to the grand goal of accomplishing the program agreed by the 9th Party Congress, further accelerating our country's advance toward the bright skies of communism. Comrades and Deputies, the Grand National Assembly, having fulfilled, in this session, its role of Constituent Assembly, has the historic mission of adopting our country's fundamental law : the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Reflecting the present stage of development of our society, the Constitution draft, submitted to the Grand National Assembly consecrates the revolutionary advances made by the Romanian people in the 21 years since our liberation, the definitive victory of socialism in Romania! In all that's beautiful I just see you You give happiness a name when you're with me In every song that's ever blossomed and bore fruit And in everything that's new around me In the amber of the coming dawn And in the evening's sapphire Darling, you're the one I see Time grips me in its beauty dance I'm sorry I don't have nine lives But even if, by some miracle, I did I know why I couldn't forget you 'Cause in all that's beautiful I just see you… I wish you the best for the new year, 1966! Europe is the continent where the two world wars started, shaking the world in the first half of this century. That is why, it is of utmost importance to achieve European security. The recent Bucharest meeting of the Political Advisory Board of the Warsaw Treaty member states has assessed, based on in-depth analysis of the state of things on our continent, that the conditions are met in order to take a different approach to the issue of European security. Emphasizing the necessity of incorporating the historical realities on our continent, following the 2nd World War and the existence of the two German states, socialist countries have underlined that the European security framework needs to include the German issue, including the issue of Germany's reunification. The Bucharest declaration also stipulates a number of measures in order to relieve military tensions in Europe among which, the abolition of NATO's aggressive bloc and the Warsaw Treaty alike. Withdrawing the American troops and other non-European troops on our continent, and all alien troops within national borders. HARVEST DAY 1966 SHOOTING BEAR This is love, I'm singing it for the first time And I'm never gonna forget it No no no no Today I'm happy Today I'm in love And I'm never gonna forget it No no no no Love comes when you least expect it It comes alive in your heart And you feel your heart burst into flames from the longing that's taken you over… BELOVED LEADERS OF PARTIES WELCOME TO BUCHAREST - Are you king Mircea? - Yes I am! I demand that you obey, else your gold turns into clay. Whether you have come to conquer and whatever you may do, I am offering my peaceful welcome to you. Soldiers, the fate of the battle brought victory to our side, Romanian justice is crowned, may we wear it with pride! LONG LIVE THE RCP! LONG LIVE THE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LONG LIVE THE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY Mister President, we are convinced that your visit to Romania signifies a landmark in the evolution of Romanian-French cooperation. On a continent mostly inhabited by Latin, German and Slavic peoples, we the French have been from the very beginning defenders of the West and you are "la Romania"! Most importantly, Romanians and French we all want to be ourselves that is, in the words of Eminescu, we want the national state, not the cosmopolitan state. The Secretary General of the Czech Communist Party has the floor. Comrade Alexander Dubcek. Representatives of the Socialist Republic of Romania and of the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia have signed a treaty of friendship and mutual aid. They say about friendship that it's a matter of the heart. I believe I am in no way understating this most humane feeling if I add that it is also a matter of wisdom, and when relations between peoples are concerned, it is also a matter of great responsibility. We ask you to convey to the Romanian people our most sincere thanks for the friendship, sympathy and international support you are granting us. We shall respond in kind. I want once again to thank you for welcoming me here and for the flowers I have received. Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu has the floor. Dear comrades and friends, as you well know, the Romanian people has saluted, from the outset, in full understanding and sympathy, the ample activity of the working people of Czechoslovakia, led by the Communist Party onto a new path shaped during the January Plenaries. My beliefs were reinforced by our meeting, by your smiling eyes, your warm welcome to the First Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, who is firmly guiding the nation toward accomplishing the Party's program. We wish you every success in your efforts toward the multilateral development of socialist Czechoslovakia and we take this opportunity to assure you of the brotherly solidarity and support of Romanian communists, of the entire Romanian people. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED Please speak slowly to allow translation. Go ahead. How do you envisage, how do you see the ideological cooperation among communist parties, and what does the Romanian Communist Party consider to be necessary for Marxist philosophy to fluently adapt to the circumstances of the atomic age? Cooperation between communist parties must start from the scientific notions regarding the development of human society, from an analysis of social life through the lenses of dialectic and historical materialism, which is the basis of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. And with this, I believe I have also answered the question about what needs to be done in the future. There are two questions for comrade Ceausescu, and one for comrade Manescu. What is the difference between the Bucharest declaration on European security and the Karlovy Vary declaration? You have both of them. Read them and draw your own conclusions. Seeing how the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Romanian Communist Party are the only country and party on good terms with all countries and parties, including the Communist Party of China, without any contradictions, the question is, how can the Romanian Communist Party… what does it, how does it do that? There is no secret there, you know. The Romanian Communist Party starts from the premise that among communists there must be cooperation, that one party must not interfere in other parties' business, And that where there are divergent points of view, issues must be talked through in the spirit of comradeship, by acting together upon what leads us to common conclusions. A question for comrade Manescu, as a representative of socialis countries in the U.N.: what is the situation of the socialist countries and what are the expectations of their activity within the U.N.? First, I do not like to theorize on the position I hold in this organization. However, just so you know, I confess I would have liked this question to be addressed to the head of our delegation. Still, since I have permission to answer, I must say that the position of the socialist states in the United Nations Organization is good, and that, in general, socialism has proven its capacity to participate in discussing and solving under proper circumstances any international issue, inevitably. On Wednesday, a Soviet newspaper, Krasnaia Zvezda, has published an article by a Polish general, Baranowski, which expressed his anxiety about the consolidation of antisocialist forces in Czechoslovakia, and he volunteers his support for the Czechoslovakian party, people and government. In the journalists' circles, this stand is seen as an intention or desire to effect a military intervention in Czechoslovakia. Would it not be better to clarify, within the Warsaw Treaty, when exactly it is necessary to provide military aid to another country? The treaty is very clear on that point. There is no need for further clarification. It is created to offer support against alien attacks by an imperialist country against a member state of the Treaty. The five socialist countries' invasion into Czechoslovakia is a big mistake and a severe threat to peace in Europe and to the fate of socialism in the world. WE STAND BY THE CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PEOPLE There is no justification and no reason to accept, for even a second, even the idea of a military intervention in the internal affairs of a kindred socialist state. The issue of choosing the path to building socialism is a choice of each party, each state, each people. No one can claim to advise, to direct the manner in which socialism is built. We must, now and for good, put an end to interference in the affairs of other countries, other parties! It was said that the danger of counter-revolution loomed in Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow, perhaps they will find people to claim that even our meeting displayed counter-revolutionary tendencies. We must answer one and all that the Romanian people will not allow anyone to trespass on our land! Ceausescu, Ceausescu… Good? Long live the Romanian-American friendship! AUTOMOBILE PLANT NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OF THE VILLAGES 1969 WE PROTECT THE GAME AND FISH THEY BELONG TO THE PEOPLE LONG LIVE AUGUST 23 ROMANIA'S LIBERATION FROM FASCIST OPPRESSION Stop crying, baby Forget everything Stop crying, baby There's no use in crying Remember, in life A smile drives the tears away Forget about your pain Don't be blue Stop crying, baby… WELCOME The measures we take in the areas of ideology, culture and education will surely signify a landmark in bridging the gaps in this field, in improving the ideological activity which is to contribute to transforming communist conscience into a huge revolutionary force of our society. The theater belongs to the people, as do the plowed fields and the factories. Its fruit can only be picked by the many who crave it, the fruit to match the taste and needs of the many, not the unpredictable taste and whims of the theater and of the few. Socialist theater can only be a theater of socialist society, of a world of one faith only, one homeland only, one ideal of beauty, good and truth, the communist ideal. That is clearly and illuminatingly explained in comrade Ceausescu's speech of June the 9th, That is what the party and country say through his voice. Lately, perhaps, those who do research have become too closed in inside their labs and offices, they read a lot and too much and yet, closed in from everyday living practice, they have become sterile. This is a prompt, then, that to rich scientific information we add a deep understanding, that we contribute, through our activity, to constructive work, to practical work. That is one of the main prompts. I believe that for writers it is imperative that we do what we are urged to do, with conviction and courage, and above all with the openness toward truth that must reside in every progressive act. In the near future, in the transportation and construction companies, in our state-owned agricultural companies for the mechanization of agriculture, as well as in research and development institutes, we want to have specialized boards and committees attached to the Workers' Committees, also under the management of the Party structures of these organizations. Thus we will have workers' auditing councils, committees for the organization of production and labor, committees for savings and productive management, committees for the mechanization and automatization of production, committees for production quality, and for those organizations involved in exports, export - import committees. Also, in the organizations that have development and investment plans, committees for development and investment issues. The workers' committees and councils, in full agreement with local party structures, will organize if necessary, other committees. That's what we should have with these so-called combines. They should cut The material would be cleaner in contact with the soil… …we should have two versions, and both should have bales at the back. That helps us, comrade Secretary General, so we can sow while we harvest the maize. Sure. So we could use this sort of ideal machine. It can be done, we just need some time to think it through. We need to consider it in the spirit of economy. To my mind, it's not impossible. Sure! For the election of the President of our Republic, the first President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, I suggest to the Grand National Assembly, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and the National Council of the Socialist Unity Front, the candidacy of the man who gave so much to his country and people, to human civilization and peace, the Secretary General of our party, comrade Nicolae Ceausescu. At this solemn moment of your investiture to the high office of President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, on behalf of the Grand National Assembly please receive the symbols of the dignity and prestige of state power, of the sovereign authority of the Romanian people, of its will to develop free and independent on the path of socialism and communism. Comrade President, I invite you to take the oath, according to the Constitution. The people of the United States are honored by having as our guest a great leader of a great country. It is a great benefit to me as president to have a chance to consult with a national and international leader like our guest today. His influence as Romanian leader throughout the international world is exceptional. From the Carpathians to the sea The sun rises in the sky For my beloved country Shining like a star The whole country sings The springtime of our life The song of toil and hard-work The song of Romania Let's give thanks For the life we live To our Beloved Leader Son of this great nation Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you… HAPPY BIRTHDAY Gogu Radulescu ON BEHALF OF THE CENTROCOOP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAPPY BIRTHDAY ON BEHALF OF DAMBOVITA COUNTY HAPPY BIRTHDAY Leonte Rautu TELEORMAN RCP COUNTY COMMITTEE THE POPULAR COUNTY COUNCIL HAPPY BIRTHDAY Stefan Andrei RCP MEHEDINTI COUNTY COMMITTEE RCP CLUJ COUNTY COMMITTEE HAPPY BIRTHDAY Lidia and Paul Niculescu-Mizil THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THE WORKERS' ECONOMIC AUDITING COUNCIL THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE ON BEHALF OF OLT COUNTY HAPPY BIRTHDAY Manea and Maria Manescu THE HISTORY OF THE ROMANIANS The Senate of the University of Bucharest, in its session of 24 January 1973, is awarding comrade Nicolae Ceausescu, Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, President of the State Council of the Socialist Republic of Romania, the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Bucharest. The High Awards Committee of the Socialist Republic of Romania hereby underwrites the decision of the University of Bucharest. Now that I am turning 55, with 40 years of revolutionary activity behind me, I can say, without false modesty, that I have always done my duty as a faithful soldier of the Party, that I have relentlessly served the cause of socialism, the vital interests of our people. Ceausescu, Happy Birthday! Ceausescu, Happy Birthday! I… I can only, right now, think of my parents… I am a faithful son of my people, I know its pain and its wants. The people's wish is my own: to be stronger, happier, free, master of its destiny, stand prouder, stand higher in communism. I am a peasant's son, I am a worker, so I organically belong to the two basic classes of our socialist society. I have become an intellectual knowing one cannot be a real communist, one cannot properly fulfill high responsibilities without learning, without studying without knowing the most valuable output of humanity in the field of science and culture of knowledge, and above all, without taking on the revolutionary thinking of the proletariat, the dialectic and historical materialism, Marxism-Leninism. Do you remember Kogalniceanu's words to Cuza: Do everything to be just and to serve the people. This motto needs to guide all communists, all those who, one way or another, are called to weigh in for our country. Ceausescu, Happy Birthday! It is the Bucharest students' delegation. Romania's representative His Excellency, Mr. Nicolae Ceausescu, President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, has the floor. Mr. President, High representatives of countries participating in this conference, ladies and gentlemen. It is for the first time that the states of the European continent come together for such a reunion in order to agree upon their future, upon their cooperation, security, and peace in Europe. I would like to make reference to some of the illustrious speakers before me, noting that there are, indeed, democracies and democracies. How can we speak of equality, of freedom and democracy, in the rich states same as in countries with a GDP less than $100 per capita? Accomplishing equality means achieving the necessary material conditions. How can we speak in general of an absolutization of the so-called democratic norms ignoring that there are different forms of democracy and I dare say that the democracy we are building in Romania is much more superior to the one that some of the previous speakers were talking about. So we need to correctly inform peoples. We need to start from the fact that we must end various misinformation activities that are damaging cooperation and security. I am referring, among others, to the activity of certain radio stations broadcasting from countries participating in this conference and in no way serving the noble goals we are putting down in the documents to be signed today. One might say that by signing these documents we are successfully ending the first General European Conference. Also, we need to add that this is merely the first stage, important though it is, of the fight for security and peace. We must not create the illusion that we can sit back safely. The next session starts at 3 PM. ALEXANDRA CEAUSESCU 1889 - 1977 Sing, violins, sing Lovingly sing to him Wish him health Wish him luck in everything Let the skylarks sing along Praise Romania with their song Sing the beauty of the land In this paradise of man. Comrades Comrade President, I would like to take the floor. I signed up for it - the very first day! - Comrade Parvulescu I don't have you on my list. Give them to the Secretariate. The Congress has approved - Give it to the Secretariate. - The Congress has approved… I ask the Congress to allow me to make a statement. Right, give the floor to comrade. Comrade Constantin Parvulescu has the floor. Why didn't you… Comrades, I was astonished by how this Congress was prepared, and by the Congress itself. Comrade Ceausescu took the liberty to set it up before the Congress, and during the Congress and the Conferences, for himself to be reelected Secretary General of the party. That is unprecedented, comrades, in the history of our Party and in the history of communist parties. Why is Ceausescu pulling the strings to get elected as member of the Central Committee, so that he'd be reelected from among the members of the Central Committee? Why? Because Ceausescu is avoiding Party control, - He's trying to… - That's not correct, what you said! Why is it not correct? - Comrade… - Ceausescu reelected! Ceausescu reelected in the 12th Congress! That's how the Congress was set up, comrades. There are agitators here, from front to back. That's not true! Comrades, I do not vote to elect Ceausescu to the board of the party! Ceausescu reelected in the 12th Congress! Can I continue, comrade president? He shouldn't have been given the floor. He's an agitator! Give the floor to… Comrade Popescu-Puturi has the floor. Esteemed and beloved comrade Ceausescu, esteemed and cherished colleagues, friends and guests. Comrade Parvulescu Constantin, speaking of the past of our movement, it was a positive thing that the basic documents were made public for congresses still in preparation. Our Party's board has always done this in good faith and this time, how shall I put it it has extended the time given to discussing the basic documents, getting millions and millions of people involved in voicing their opinion. Whoever wanted to support the proposals for our Secretary General to be reelected to lead the Party had months at their disposal to give their point of view. Ceausescu reelected in the 12th congress! They had millions of notebooks, millions of pencils, hundreds of thousands of fountain pens. Who stopped them, in the evening, in the light… from writing down their thoughts on the Secretary General if they had a different point of view? But in what our Party has gathered so far, in mass proportions, what people wrote in the privacy of their homes, everything is superlative concerning the extraordinary capacity and activity of our Secretary General, Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu. Ceausescu reelected in the 12th Congress! That is why, beloved comrade Ceausescu, you must ignore this outburst, consider it a minor incident because we must above all consider the feelings of the entire party and the entire people. Thank you, and our very best wishes to you. Ceausescu reelected in the 12th Congress! Ceausescu and the people!

FRIENDSHIP SOLIDARITY It is not enough to write only about abstract things, though they, too, are necessary. Naturally, it's beautiful to hear a good love poem but that is not enough. We need social poetry as well, we need revolutionary poetry. I think women, too, would like to hear such poetry, and our writers and poets must understand these things. I wish to warmly thank the Executive Political Committee of the Party's Central Committee for the letter and wishes they sent on my birthday. My birthday coincides with the anniversary of over four decades of activity within the revolutionary movement of the Romanian Communist Party. I could not fail to remember at such a time that I have had the great happiness that ever since the underground days of working directly with my life partner who has been to me an example of whole-hearted commitment and dedication to our revolutionary work, an example of unwavering faith in the victory of the workers' just cause, the cause of our Party. We have started the new five-year period with results which are generally, positive, although we must say if we had worked better, if we had acted with greater responsibility, if we had organized and controlled the activity, we could have had better results in our social and economic development. It is therefore necessary that this year we do everything so that the provisions of our plan be fully achieved. And wherever we have everything in place for selling our production, I'm referring to exports in particular, we should do everything to produce even more. It is necessary that we do everything so that this year's agriculture programs, the self-sufficient production program be fully accomplished. With the animal stock that we have we can accomplish, by accomplishing carving surplus, a surplus of meat above what we predicted. We must do everything for the development of science. We have many innovators, many highly-specialized workers, many peasants able to solve many issues of industrial and agricultural practice and technology. In effect, the entire people must actively participate democratically in the management of all types of work. It is necessary, comrades, to pay greater attention to providing ideological and political education and raising revolutionary awareness and stirring the socialist conscience of the masses, of the people. The complex issues raised by the socialist development of our country by international developments raise many issues and questions. In order to understand them, people must have notions of politics, notions of advanced general knowledge they must clearly understand events, know the direction of social development, understand that the zig-zagging of this impetuous development is inevitable in this fiery fight between the forces of socialism and the forces of capitalism and imperialism, and also inevitable are certain backlashes and advances and even defeats. But all these merely bring forth better measures for our advancement and the future belongs to socialism, communism, to a world without exploiters, without imperialists and capitalists.

There's no one left to talk to, now. We had an interpreter, but then we got Shevarnadze's car out of the motorcade. Now he's saying he is coming here. - Everything ok? - Not really… It's hot. Just warm. It's nice. It's hot. Very hot. THE POPULAR REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA THE POPULAR REPUBLIC OF POLAND THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA THE UNION OF THE SOCIALIST SOVIET REPUBLICS I would like to emphasize the importance of the meeting of the Political Advisory Committee of the Socialist States of the Warsaw Treaty which took place last week in Bucharest. In this meeting, we also discussed issues of world economics and especially the situation of developing countries. That's because at present the situation of developing countries is especially dire. Over 4 billion people live in poverty, and during this decade their situation continued to worsen, while the rich countries, and within them a small group of rich people, have annually accumulated dozens and dozens of billions of dollars from the developing countries. This situation cannot continue any further. This is the world that certain gentlemen urge us to revert to. A world of inequality, robbery, exploitation. We have known it for hundreds of years and another hundred under this capitalism. That is why we have stated that, for us, such a path is no longer an option. Our people sometimes say that this will happen when pigs may fly. Do not rush to applaud. Modern genetics made huge progress, and the day might come when pigs do fly. And yet, not even then, in such circumstances, will we accept to revert back. In Romania, capitalism has lived its last day. The people are the true masters and will remain master of their destiny, and of the riches of their country. That's right! Ceausescu heroism, Romania communism. These circles and these people should direct their attention to what concerns two directions: how to eliminate the exploitation of developing countries, settling the external debt of one billion two hundred… billion dollars of these countries. And not through symbols. Symbolism may be good for the arts, but it's worthless in economics and politics. LONG LIVE THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROMANIA'S LIBERATION Wait a second.

Hello. - When you see the model, it's… - Yeah, it's… It's smaller. Smaller scale, comrade. Here. Life-size… Yeah, yeah, it's big. It's really big. It's going to be something special. As a worthy founder of the House of the Republic, from the bottom of our hearts we wish you a long and happy life, good health, and strength so you may lead us ahead towards consolidating socialism and communism in our beloved homeland, the Socialist Republic of Romania. Happy birthday, Comrade Secretary General. It's higher, and that one's even higher. Enough. Yes, of course. Dear comrades and friends, citizens of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Tonight I'm addressing the entire people of our socialist homeland concerning the serious events that took place in the past couple of days in Timisoara. On December 16 and 17, a few groups of hooligans have organized a series of rallies and incidents attacking state institutions, destroying and robbing a series of buildings, shops, public buildings, and on December 17, they intensified their activity against state and party institutions, including some military units. From the way these events unfolded and from the statements of participants in these events, these groups meant to cause unrest and bring down the institutions and the common assets of the city, and to signal the start of such events in others cities. I am addressing the citizens of Timisoara with an appeal to their sense of responsibility so they do everything for the calm and order of their cities, contributing to the calm and order throughout the country. I wish to state with all responsibility that our armed units entrusted with defending our country's independence and sovereignty and the revolutionary conquests, have shown much, very much patience. "I refuse". The defendant is refusing to answer… I will answer before the Grand National Assembly! Shut off that broken record. We've heard it. We're familiar with the stubbornness that you've shown so far. "I refuse to answer the question who is the author of the genocide in Timisoara." For history, the Grand National Assembly will find out the truth… and not those who organized… -The coup… -…the coup… -Organized the coup? -The people did… …serving foreign powers. -You have usurped the power. -Let him only answer the questions. You only answer my questions. I won't answer! In Bucharest… who ordered soldiers to fire upon the crowd? To shoot the young? What young? You don't know? You don't know the situation in Bucharest, when the crowd was fired at in the Palace Square? Is this news to you? Even now, fanatics are still shooting innocent people, the elderly, the children. They're shooting into buildings… Who are these fanatics? Did the people train them, or did you? Who paid them? I'm not answering any question, it's… I'm not answering, and please don't take this as an answer. No one was shot at in the Palace Square. -There's nothing to discuss. -…on the contrary, there were firm orders not to shoot. Who gave them? Did you issue the order? I did, yes! Me! Even on TV, even in the tele-conference that's on record. -Take it down… -No! Don't consider this… I only answer to the Grand National Assembly. What you're saying is all lies, mystifications, and provocations! What Romanians like Is the mountains and the creeks Where they reign free and peacefully Ruling over nature Where among the ancient cliffs The springs gush and flow In the forests down below Where among the ancient cliffs The springs gush and flow In the forests down below Where the deer leap Seeking shelter from the hunter In the shadow of the fir tree Where every traveler rests Where the sheep bleat Where the piper plays his tune With a mournful melody Where the sheep bleat Where the piper plays his tune With a mournful melody That's why Romanians like The mountains and creeks high above That's why Romanians like The mountains and creeks high above Living in happiness Freedom and love As time swiftly flies by Living in happiness Freedom and love As time swiftly flies by Time flies by Time flies by
