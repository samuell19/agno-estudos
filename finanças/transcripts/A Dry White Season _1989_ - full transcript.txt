Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Baba! How can we fight for freedom... when our fathers sit in the government's beer halls and get drunk? Boycott these places! The beer that you drink buys the bullets that kill your children! Come on, boys! Watch your wing! Come on! - Yes. - Come on, Johan! - Yes! - He's got a great future. That was brilliant! Like father, like son. - To your family! - To our headmaster! - You coming, Gordon? - Yes, Mr. Ben. Jonathan will come and help me. How is Jonathan? The algebra still giving him trouble? He's working hard, Mr. Ben. Your money will not be wasted. - Emily and me will always thank you. - That's fine. - See you later, Gordon. - All right, Mr. Ben. Get inside. Come to Grandpa. Just like your ma. Be gentle with Grandpa, Piet. Don't hit Grandpa. Smell. Almost ready, Chris. Any minute. No, come on, keep your hands off, man. Johan, man, come on, bring it... Next time you get the fork. Jonathan. I'm sorry, Gordon, but they must have had a reason. I know my son, Mr. Ben. If he says he was not doing anything, I believe him. The court didn't. Was he represented? Our lawyer, Julius Ngakula, is in detention. - That's why I came to you, Mr. Ben. - Ben? I'll be there in a minute, darling. Get some iodine, will you? God. Johan. Jonathan, did you tell the court exactly what happened? What does he know about court? Before he knew, it was all over. We need a good lawyer, Mr. Ben. It's too late for a lawyer, Gordon. There's nothing to be done now. You don't understand, Mr. Ben. I don't want him to have a police record. It will be there for the rest of his life. It's such a minor matter. Let it go, Gordon. Here. Put that on his backside. I'm not worried about those wounds. I know they'll get better. It's the wounds here. These are the ones I worry about. There's nothing to be done. The cuts looked terrible, Pa. He must have done something. - What happened to him? - The court sentenced him to a caning. These kids are going mad. Bloody savages. The only language they understand is force. I thought the idea was to give them their own homelands. Let them live with their own kind. No conflict then. Everybody's happy. Come on. Enough talk. Let's eat. I don't care what other parents are saying. Now, listen to me. I tell you, no demonstrations. Tomorrow you go to school. But there'll be nobody at school, Baba. Then you and Robert will be the only ones. What do I say to Mr. Ben? "Thank you for the school fees, but my son doesn't want to learn"? Let Mr. Ben keep his white money for his Boer education. We want to learn in English. We don't want to learn Afrikaans. You don't understand, Baba. They don't want us to be really educated. If we learn in Afrikaans, we have no future, Baba. They want us to be messenger boys, mine boys... And garden boys like me. Yes, Baba. Everybody knows that you're a wise man. Everybody comes to ask your advice. And they respect you. You should be a lawyer, Baba. But what are you? This is a peaceful demonstration. We know the police will come. But be calm. Be cool. Remember, this is a protest march. We are not here to fight the police. Let's go. Bantu education! Now you listen to me! This is an illegal demonstration. I order you to disperse immediately! This is the last warning! Disperse immediately, or I will take action! Tear gas! Ready! Fire! Watch out! After them! This way. They're behind you. Jonathan! You killed my sister. Shoot me! I said shoot me now! Shoot me! Tell me again. You were there when all this happened? Yes, Baba. - And you say you saw everything? - Yes, Baba. Are you sure it was Jonathan they took away? Yes, Baba Gordon. And they arrested Wellington, too. It's hell out there. I've been like an ambulance all day, taking children to the hospital. One even died in the car. God knows how many the bastards killed. It's happening in Alexander, Springs, all the townships. Stanley, they've arrested Jonathan. He's not on the list. Okay, baasie, but is that all the names, baasie? I've told you, he's not in custody. Are you trying to make me out as a liar? No, baasie. Why don't you try the hospital, the mortuary? I will, baasie. What about headquarters, baasie? John Vorster Square, baasie? - That's enough! Move on! Next. - Okay. Dankie, baasie. That's three this morning, Pa. Hi, Gordon. Gordon, where have you been the last two days? Hold it, champ. Gordon, I'm talking to you. What's the trouble, man? - They arrested Jonathan. - Not again. What for? There is big trouble in the townships. They're killing our children. Gordon... I saw the bodies, Mr. Ben. Many have been detained. I went to the hospital. To the mortuary. Everywhere. The police deny they've got Jonathan. He disappeared. Why didn't you tell me? I am telling you. Let me see what I can find out. Lan McKenzie, please. Benjamin Du Toit. We met at Peter Crozier's. Hello? Yes. Ben, telephone. Hello? Here. How did they say he died, Mr. Ben? - In the rioting. - In the rioting? They buried him is all I know, when nobody came to claim the body. - They buried him where? - I don't know. You don't know? That was all Mr. McKenzie could find out. Then I'll find out. As God is my witness, I'll find out what really happened... - and where he lies. - Please, Gordon. It's a terrible thing, but there's really nothing more we can do, you or I. That's what you said when they whipped him. But he's my child. His body belongs to Emily and me. Jonathan! - Good night, Pa. - Bed already? Come. Bed, sweetheart. Go to sleep. He's taking this hard. God, I haven't seen that in years. Jonathan made it, remember? Come to bed. I'll be in, in a minute. Okay. - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah? Have you seen this boy inside? No, I didn't see him. This is my own child. They took him in. No, I didn't see him. Did you see this child inside? He's my son. Inside there. Emily. Julius Ngakula, our lawyer. So you are the cleaner at John Vorster Square? Yes, sir. - How long have you worked there? - Twenty years, sir. Where did you see Jonathan? I saw him in the cell, Mr. Julius. Did you speak to him? I talked to him and said: "My child, what have they done to you?" But he could not answer. And then a policeman came. - It's me, Wellington. - Wellington? Come in. They released me this afternoon. - My mother said that you wished to see me. - Yes. What have they done to you? Two times, they put a wet bag on my head. You can't breathe, Baba. You think you're going to die. They never stopped, Baba. They kept asking, "Who are the ringleaders?" But, what can I tell them? I know nothing. I heard Jonathan next door. He was screaming in Afrikaans. Asseblief mei, baas. Then it was very quiet. And the man said, "Come on, Ngubene. "Get up. "Stop pretending. " That's all I know, Baba. Later, somebody said... he was taken to the hospital. I never saw him again. Take the bastard away. Lieutenant, I told you this man was trouble. Come and help us! The Afrikaners suffered under the British rule... and decided to take to the interior, to find land far from the British. On the Great Trek, they had to fight many native tribes. The Xhosas, Zulus, Tswanas... Basothos, and many others. They beat them, and had farms all over South Africa. All right, little monkeys, time's up. Thank you, Swanepoel. You wanted to see me? I'm sorry, Mr. Ben. My name is Emily. Gordon is my husband. What's happened? I have an appointment with Colonel Viljoen. My name is Benjamin Du Toit. Sign this form, please. - Meneer Du Toit. - Come in, Meneer Du Toit. - Colonel Viljoen. Captain Stolz. - Pleasure to meet you. I used to watch you play for the Transvaal. You were one of the great flyhalves. That was a long time ago. - Would you sign an autograph for my son? - With great pleasure. - What's his name? - Jaanie. My son will be thrilled. - He plays rugby? - Soccer. Traitor. - Thanks very much. See you later, Colonel. - Thank you. Please sit down. So you're inquiring about detainee Gordon Ngubene. Yes. I thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding... - that I could help straighten out. - Misunderstanding? I've known Gordon Ngubene for over 15 years, Colonel. He is an honest, diligent, hardworking African. I can't imagine why he's being detained. You'd be surprised how many... honest, churchgoing Bantu we come across during a working day. Meneer Du Toit, our task is not an easy one. The press screaming bloody murder, especially the English... and they will be the first to squeal if the Reds took over, make no mistake. We're just doing our job. I'm sure you understand. Of course I understand, Colonel. I know how complex your position is. I was just trying to say that... we're only human, and we can all make a mistake. Yeah, we can indeed. Meneer Du Toit, we can indeed. And I think one might have been made here. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about Ngubene? I'd welcome it. Did he ever discuss his son's death with you? I was the one who broke the news to him. But he accepted the truth? Well, he was upset, of course. But he is a religious man, and in time he will resign himself to it, I'm sure. You mean he hasn't? Was he angry? Rebellious? Come along, Colonel. If someone told you that your child had died... and wouldn't tell you how it happened or where the body was buried... wouldn't you be upset? We told him how his son died. And when the time is right, we will tell him where he's buried. What are you waiting for? - You have a son, Meneer Du Toit? - Yes. Does he burn and destroy everything he can lay his hands on? No. And neither does mine. That's what I can't understand... after everything the government does for them, with an open heart. Think about it. We're for you, not against you. Believe me, I'm with you all the way, Colonel. If Ngubene is the innocent man you claim, he will be released soon. You have my word. Thank you, Colonel. May I ask a favor? Gordon's wife is very worried. May she bring him a change of clothes and some food? Of course. No problem. And thank you for your help. Thank you. Come on, you bloody bastard... who else has been feeding you this bullshit? Why don't you answer, kaffir? Who told you to collect the affidavits? I want my son's body. All right, kaffir. Let's start again. Sepati, get the drinks ready, would you? What do you want? Sorry, Madam. We have come to see Mr. Ben. I am Gordon's wife. The teeth were in the pocket of the shirt she exchanged the clean one for. Yes. One moment. One of his partners can see you immediately. Yes. Dick Peterson... 22 Hilldown Road. Got it. Thank you. I'm sorry to have done this to you on a Saturday, Mr. McKenzie, but... Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ben. You must not give up hope, Emily. Hope is a white word, lani. It's not hope we need. Come, Sisi. Tomorrow it'll be all first class again. Why would they arrest an innocent man, Ben? Our Special Branch is too busy rounding up terrorists and communists. These are not nice times, Ben. There are subversives everywhere. Anton, you know Gordon. He's a gardener, for God's sake. I don't know anything about Gordon, Ben, and neither do you. He tends the flowers, he trims the hedges. That's all know about him. Ben, blacks lead double lives. One you see, and one you don't. That's what I like about them. Trust me. They'll smile at you one moment and knife you the next. All Gordon was trying to do was find his son's body. - That's not a crime. - Then he has nothing to worry about. Except his teeth. How do you feel today? Are you ready to talk or ready to fly? Captain? Don't ever open that door without knocking! Yes, Captain. Do you think it will be ready for Piet's birthday? Stanley. Gordon is dead. They say he committed suicide. Hanged himself. My God! Why would he commit suicide? I said, they say he committed suicide. What do you mean? What do I mean? What about Timol, who they say jumped from the 10th floor? What about Ngudle? What about Mosala? Joyi? Malele? I've got 37 others for you. They all died in that John Vorster Square. All suicide, huh? Where is his body? In Soweto? I'd like to see him. Look, I came here to deliver Emily's message, that's all. Don't be silly, Ben. I want to see him, Susan. There are riots all over Soweto. Don't look for trouble, man. - I want to see him. - You're out of it, so stay out of it. I'll drive myself then. What you gonna do, lani? Buy yourself a map? Okay. Finish. Welcome to the land of love and glory. Come on. Hurry. Okay. He's okay. Hi, Stanley. Who's that? Meneer Du Toit, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Melanie Bruwer. I write for The Rand Daily Mail. Is it possible to talk to you about Gordon Ngubene? I understand that you've known him for some years. No. What is Emily going to do now? - She wants an inquest. - Really? Good. I'll ask Ian McKenzie to help her. If it makes you feel good, lani. Will you take me to the funeral? Are you crazy? That's no place for you, man. Here. Take this number. In case you need me and I'm not there, just say, lani phoned. All right? What does lani mean, anyway? That's enough for one day, man. Thank you. Hello, Ben! - What was the point of coming here? - What? - Gordon has been murdered. - Oh, come on. I saw his body. I could barely recognize his face. - He was murdered. - Hello, Susan. And what about you, Pa? Going off to Soweto. You could have been murdered. Mr. Du Toit, sir. Mr. Du Toit. - How do you do, Mr. McKenzie? - How do you do? Won't you sit down? I beg your pardon. - I'm terribly sorry. - I'm sorry you're not feeling fit. Well, I actually feel rather spry as things go. Unfortunately, I fell in love with these flowers 10 years ago. And I've looked after them. I've cared for them. And then, like naughty mistresses... they've shown their thanks by giving me a permanent allergy. But I've found myself with an undying affection for them. Especially this beautiful, troublesome wench. There must be something you can do. Bloody doctors tell you anything, take your money... I take these lozenges. Totally ineffective, but they're rather tasty. I'm rather fond of the lavender one. Would you care for one? No, thank you. I'm terribly sorry. Would you like a cup of tea? No, thank you. I'm here on a matter of justice. Oh, justice. I'm afraid that's a trifle more complex to serve you up... than a cup of tea. But, in any event, please do go on. Gordon Ngubene. You remember the story of Gordon Ngubene? Yes, dreadful, dreadful story. I want justice for him to the full extent of the law. You see, justice and law... Mr. Du Toit, are often just... I suppose they could be described as distant cousins. And here in South Africa, they're simply not on speaking terms at all. And I've familiarized myself with your dossier. And I'm afraid that my counsel to you is to just give it up. - Give it up? - Yes. Because there is nothing to be done. That's what I said to his son when his son was caned. And now his son is dead. That's what I thought that about Gordon when he was jailed. Now he is dead because of my neglect. I have known that family for 15 years, Mr. McKenzie. I cannot give it up. Yes. That does make a difference, of course. There must be some penalty under law for those who commit murder. Mr. Du Toit, may I ask you... how long you have lived with us in South Africa? All my life. I'm afraid that I am... I'm just not the barrister that you're seeking. I'm sorry. I'm confused, Mr. McKenzie. I thought that you had undertaken many cases and won them... in support of human rights. No, you see, what you don't realize... that every time I've won a case, they simply changed the law. So, therefore, my considered counsel to you... is to just simply chuck the lot. I shall find another barrister, and I shall prove you wrong. Good afternoon, Mr. McKenzie. Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit. I will take your case. I will take your case, if only to make it abundantly clear... how justice in South Africa is misapplied... when it comes to the question of race. Emily, how are you? - This is Father Masonwane. - Benjamin Du Toit. - This is my friend, Margaret Ledwaba. - Benjamin Du Toit. Please. Here, take this one. Emily, I have been to see Mr. McKenzie... and he has agreed to represent you at the inquest. Thank you, Mr. Ben. He's the best we can get. You mean well, sir, but it is better to forget. If we keep the pain alive, the hate will weaken our faith. They killed my child, who was a good child. They killed my husband, who did what a father must do. People must know the truth. The living close the eyes of the dead. And now the dead will open the eyes of the living. Are you not afraid of the road you are taking, Sister Emily? No. We are now leaving beautiful Soweto, the high-class slaughterhouse. Who are you, Stanley? A mean black cat in the night, lani. I bet you are. - And Emily? - She is like a sister. - We grew up together. - Then you're a Zulu? Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, whatever. I'm African, that's all. Me, too. My father had a farm. I grew up like any African boy in the bush. Ate African porridge. No shoes except Sunday. Barefoot. No vote. Carry passbook. Robben Island jail. Careful, lani. Yeah. - Good morning, Dr. Herzog. - Morning. I was wondering if you could assist me in identifying these objects. Do you recognize them? The appear to be human teeth. Yes, they're from the body of the deceased. Gordon Ngubene. It may be so. Were you notified by Captain Stolz? Yes... Ngubene complained of a toothache. And what was noteworthy about his appearance? Nothing. You see, the police report reads: The injuries to his head and body were extensive. Doesn't that stir your memory just a trifle? I don't know. You don't know whether it does or not? I remember pulling the rotten teeth from his mouth. And did you administer an anesthetic... before you tore the teeth from his jaws? I don't recall. And who ordered you to pull those teeth? I don't recall. Dr. Herzog, what day is it today? Friday, the 24th. I'm greatly relieved. I thought that you have lost complete control of your faculties. That will be all. Thank you. No more questions. The deceased was arrested on the 27th of July, was he not? Yes. And what was the reason for Gordon Ngubene's apprehension? He was in possession of incriminating documents. I have an objection. Good morning, Captain Stolz. Good morning, Mr. McKenzie. We have before us no evidence whatsoever... that these documents were incriminating, Your Worship. Can you not give us an example, Captain Stolz? Yes. He subscribed to a newspaper called The World For Black Workers. Well, I subscribe to The World For Black Workers. Do you suppose, Your Worship, that places me... in some jeopardy of arrest and detainment? I have nothing to add, Your Worship. Objection overruled. Continue with your evidence, Advocate Louw. I beg your pardon, Your Worship. Did you say that my objection is overruled? Yes, overruled. Now, tell the court about his death. I was called at 605 hours. I was notified that the detainee was hanging by a rope tied to the window bars. Yes. And then? I summoned Dr. Jansen to make a post mortem. Thank you, Captain Stolz. Are you aware, Captain Stolz... that a post mortem examination was carried out... on behalf of the Ngubene family? Yes. By Dr. Hassiem, whose signature is also there. And where is the good doctor now? - Detained. - Under what charge? The Internal Security Act. Is this his signature? Yes, thank you. It is. I have a graphologist who will swear... that this is not Dr. Hassiem's signature. We have three police graphologists who will swear that it is. Only three? You see, Dr. Hassiem found... that the abrasions on the prisoner's neck were... Oh, yes. "Were not made by rope, but chains. " Objection! Where is the witness for this assertion, Your Worship? Dr. Hassiem is my witness. You know that Dr. Hassiem is not available to testify. I am also aware that he can be summoned by Your Worship to this courtroom. And he will be accompanied by armed guards... then chained, neck, hand, and foot... and all in a matter of minutes. I'm afraid we cannot dismiss acts of treason just when we like, Mr. McKenzie. Are you at all concerned, Your Worship, that he might be carrying... some explosive charges in one of the recesses of his body... with the intention of blowing this entire courtroom to smithereens? Mr. McKenzie, I must caution you as to your remarks. I am warning you, this court will not tolerate contemptuous fripperies. I beg your pardon, sir. Your Worship... I shall call another witness who will attest to Ngubene's physical welfare. Call Archibald Mabaso. I am going to read out to the court a statement that you signed... Archibald Mabaso. Do you understand? Yes. "I saw him brought in the late afternoon. "I had a few words with him. "He looked very good. "I saw no one go into his cell till the morning... "when they found him dead. " "He" being Ngubene? "He" being Ngubene? - No. - What? No, it is not true. But you signed this statement, man. - You signed it. - No, I never saw Ngubene! I signed it because Captain Stolz forced me to. This is what he did to me. Take him out. Get him out! Silence! I would like to recall Captain Stolz to the witness box. Good heavens! Some friend will have done that to him... to make a propaganda photograph in tomorrow's press. And will his suicide tonight make another propaganda photograph... in tomorrow's press? Your Worship, we are out there every day of our lives... fighting these terrorists and communists. And this man here... tries to cast unwarranted suspicion on the Special Branch. Special Branch? Mr. Peterson, the photographs. I'll give you Special Branch. Thank you. I have photographs here... that I'm sure will make you rather proud of your Special Branch, sir. He tried to throw himself against the bars of his window. We had to restrain him. With clubs and whips? No, we used no clubs, no whips. Then how do you account for these lacerations... these crisscross lacerations across his front and back? He must have hit the bars when he tried to jump out of his window. He behaved like a wild animal. Captain Stolz, would you have this court believe... that this man tried to throw himself through the window forwards... and being frustrated in that effort... he turned himself round... and with great force, threw himself backwards towards the window? Evidently. Would you care to demonstrate that for this court? No. Very well. Now, as for the very special and good works of your Special Branch. The seventh right rib broken. The right arm broken. Blood clots on the brain. The whole body covered with bruises. Are you too ashamed to look at these photographs, sir? Here's one that might please you indeed. His jaw broken. His nose broken. His cheekbone crushed. His eye hanging out of its socket and dangling on the crushed cheekbone. And marks and evidence... of excessive burns on his genitals. And all that... while this man was trying to get out of a window? Get them out! Get those people who caused this disruption out of the courtroom! And the rest of you, keep silent, or you'll get the same treatment. Now, Mr. McKenzie. What is it that you're trying to prove with this idiotic recitation? What... I am vainly trying to prove... with this idiotic recitation, sir... is the fact that it was not Gordon Ngubene... but Captain Stolz... who behaved like a wild animal. Therefore, in spite of the disgraceful display of counsel for the prosecution... all the available evidence clearly and indisputably proves... the death of Gordon Ngubene cannot be attributed... to the security forces of South Africa. Court dismissed. Don't worry, man. You're risking your life. - Power. - To the people. Justice. Get in. Hang on, Melanie, I'm coming with you. - But not kill him? - Of course, kill him. - But that's not possible. - The Special Branch does what it wants. - But he was just in court. - He knew what he was doing. But everyone saw him when he bared his back. I mean, they wouldn't risk it. They couldn't. Dad. Meneer Du Toit, my father, Professor Bruwer. - Benjamin Du Toit. - Nice to meet you. - Brandy? - Please, yes. Meneer Du Toit thinks I don't show enough concern for the outcome of the inquest. We lost. Does he? I'm sorry to hear that. It's like a dance, you see. You go backwards, but you also go forwards. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. You have to keep dancing. Pleasure to meet you, Meneer Du Toit. So it's all a charade then. Law and justice. When the system's threatened, they'll do anything to defend it. That means that that black detainee... - What was his name? - Mabaso. Mabaso. Means that he... gave his life... for a charade? He knew, like we all know, that with enough black bodies... they won't be able to play that game. So he just added his. Jesus. And you've seen it all before, haven't you? To you this is just another story. One more murder isn't news. But let me tell you something. It's news to me. You'd better put your rage in perspective, Benjamin Du Toit. This is a long distance race. You'll need to pace yourself. - I suppose cynicism goes with the job. - It's not cynicism, it's realism. - It has nothing to do with my reality. - It has everything to do with your reality. Just because you haven't seen it before doesn't mean it hasn't always existed. Stolz didn't just happen yesterday, and he's not going to just go away. But then you've always known that or you wouldn't be here. I'm too old. I've been too naive for too long. Don't say that. You've taken the first step. Welcome to South Africa, Ben Du Toit. Are we not answering the telephone today? My God, Pa, how could you let it go this far? You and the kaffir woman, you look like lovers. Suzette! Where's your mother? Hey, Pa, you made the front page. - You shut up! - Don't speak to your brother that way. Where's your mother? Chris has a new contract with Van Zyl and Roux. They know who you are. You didn't stop to think of anyone else, did you? Suzette, I was only trying... What am I making excuses for? - Susan? - Pa? You're such a fool. Hello? Who? I don't know you, and I have nothing to say. No, thank you for your advice. Take a look at this. Morning. You do have an 11:00, don't you, Meneer Du Toit? Why is she here? And why are you here? To eat us out of house and home. Johan, I need to speak to your mother a moment. - We haven't finished. - That's all right. I can do the rest myself. Susan... Susan, look at me. We can't keep running from one room to another. I don't want to talk, Ben. Let it go. It's not that simple. We're going to file a civil suit against the police. We? - And who's we? - Emily and me. Why this? For what? This wasn't your son who died, Ben. This wasn't your daughter. This was Gordon, the gardener. Jesus, Susan, this is not just about Gordon. This is about all of us. No. It's about all of them. And I will be damned if I let them destroy my family. I don't want Gordon's ghost in my house. I don't want the one with the dark glasses... any of these kaffirs here ever again... I just want to go back to the way it was. If you had come with me. If you had seen what was happening at that court... you'd know that we can never go back to the way it was. - I was in the court. - What? Listen to me, Ben. I heard what the police did, and I'm not saying it was right. But do you think the blacks wouldn't do the same to us... and worse, if they had half a chance? Do you think they'll let us go on living our nice, quiet, peaceful lives if they win? They'll swallow us up. It's our country, Ben. We made every inch of it. Look at the rest of Africa. It's a mess. It's like in war. You have to choose sides. You are not one of them, and they don't want you to be. Maybe terrible things are being done. Maybe. But we have to survive. And you have to choose your own people. Or you'll have no people. You have to choose the truth. Just as simple as that? - Is Hassiem out? - No, not yet. We must find anyone else who saw Gordon and Jonathan... from the moment they were arrested. We know where they were taken. Somebody put them in the van. Somebody drove them. There were eyes and ears everywhere. You find the people, I'll prepare the affidavits. - Okay. - Do you have a place to hide them? I'll find a place. And I think I should go speak to their physician who testified in court. What makes you think he'll talk to you? I just have a feeling that on his own ground, he will. Okay. When we get all we need, we'll reopen the case. Meneer Du Toit. I said everything I had to say last Friday in court. I understand, Doctor. It's just that I had the feeling that... you were as uncomfortable with the testimony as I was. I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I mean that I felt that you wanted to be able to tell the truth... and that you might put that truth in an affidavit. The truth? I told the truth. Those teeth were smashed out of Gordon Ngubene's head. You didn't extract them. Say, you're the one with the expertise in this area? You have to take an oath to be a doctor, you know. You're afraid of them, aren't you? Now that's enough, Meneer Du Toit. Good day. Did you ever actually see Gordon Ngubene? If said I didn't, would it matter? I wish you the best of luck. Do you think your place is safe enough for this? Our first affidavit from Julius. Don't worry. They'll never find it. - They'd better not. - I'll call you, Stanley. So, Tokozile, tell me what happened. On the day of the demonstration, the police shot my sister. I was crying, "Kill me. " Shoot me! Jonathan came and he helped me. The police arrested us. They took us to the police station. I never saw Jonathan again. Jonathan was semi-conscious when they admitted him to the hospital. The boy's face was a mess. Only a police doctor could see him. Two days later, he was dead. When they brought Ngubane's body to the mortuary... his clothes were full of blood. The day of the autopsy, before the doctor arrived... Captain Stolz called me. He said, "Take off the clothes and burn them. " Thank you. Something tells me you won't sign an affidavit. No, I can't. That'd be suicide. And you work at John orster Square? I had no choice. They transferred me there four months ago. - Do you attend interrogations? - No. I'm just a messenger for the Special Branch. Tell him what you told me. Once I had to deliver a file to Captain Stolz. Captain. Don't ever open that door without knocking! I heard that he died that day. They call it the airplane. Their favorite game. - Who's it? - Douma. - Douma? - Yeah, my car's giving me problems, man. It's the middle of the night, man. - Johnson Seroke? - Special Branch was busy last night. Those bastards. The best way of remembering a man, lani, is to keep on fighting. I'm not sure Stolz knows what we've got, but I know he's stopped taking any chances. You'd better be careful. All I can do is to keep them from wanting me, lani. But when they want to catch me, I'll be caught. If they want to kill me, I'll be dead. Until then, they're in for a hell of a ride. Pa, some men are here. - What's going on? - I have a warrant. I hope you will cooperate. I don't understand. Why don't you go to the bedroom? I'd prefer her to stay. Perhaps I can help you find... Don't worry, Meneer Du Toit. If there's anything of interest to us, we'll find it. We have all the time in the world. Captain? - May I see your license? - Yes. It's in the study. Please. I didn't know you were an author, Meneer Du Toit. Just tell me what you're looking for. I have nothing to hide. Captain. Those are private letters, Captain. They are from my wife... when we were very young. You have no right to take them. You have no right, Meneer Du Toit. My apologies, Mevrouw Du Toit. You have excellent taste. Sorry, darling. What a shame. - What happened? - Leave him alone. Johan? An officer came to the school and questioned him. - What did he ask you? - Just questions. - What kind of questions? - About you. About the people who have come to the house. If I known any of their names. - Well, and what did you tell them? - Nothing. What happened to your face? Afterwards, some of the boys... started calling you "kaffir lover", and a communist. I told them to stop, but they wouldn't. I'm sorry, Son. Just sorry. If you want to know something about me, Colonel, ask me. Not my boy, me. Well, if you possess any information that could be useful to us... it would be prudent to discuss it with me. - Don't threaten me, Colonel. - It's not a threat. Call it friendly advice. I don't need your advice. Just leave my family alone. You all right? I'm fine, Pa. Pa, I know the police killed Jonathan and Gordon. Do you understand why? I'm not sure, but I know it's wrong. - I'm so sorry about what happened. - Don't stop, Pa. Please, I don't want you to give up. Emily Ngubene? This here is an eviction notice. In four weeks time, you'll be taken to Zululand. You are a widow now. You have no rights to this house. Get in touch with Melanie. Merry Christmas. Hassiem's been released. It just came over the wires. That's terrific. I'll go see him. You're dressed up. - The office Christmas party. - Yes. Have to run. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, Melanie. - Dr. Hassiem? - Yes? I'm Benjamin Du Toit, Gordon Ngubene's friend. The case is closed, Mr. Du Toit. I don't wanna have anything more to do with it. - But I thought that... - You're wasting your time. I'm exhausted. I came home yesterday after three months in solitary confinement... and now I'm under house arrest. There's nothing further I can do for you. Sorry. Come. The house is bugged. - Yes? - Dr. Hassiem gave me the autopsy report. - Great. - I have a name for you. Wellington Setole. He was arrested with Jonathan Ngubene. He saw everything. - Where is he now? - Well, Zambia. And I have to get a statement from him. No, you'll never get into Zambia with a South African passport. I know. Do you know anyone? Anyone on the paper? I can go next week on my British passport. With Wellington's statement, we can nail Stolz to the wall. Fire! Right, clear your chambers... I should be wishing you a Merry Christmas. Instead I'm sorry to tell you that we're dispensing with your services. For what reason? - Ben, I warned you like a brother... - What reason? Well, for one thing you've become distracted. You're not the teacher that we... How many classes have you missed in the past month? Dammit, man. We both know this isn't about missed classes. This is about the Special Branch. Ben, you're an Afrikaner, a history teacher. Your first obligation is to your students. - I have been teaching them. - It's a question of loyalty. - To whom? - To your community. - Merry Christmas. - One more thing. It'd be better if your son didn't come back, either. We don't need traitors here. What are we waiting for? What kind of a job will he be able to get now? I will get a job. Come on, everyone. I'll be Father Christmas. Here, Johan. Open this. Hey, Johan, I bet it's your first shaving kit. Merry Christmas, everybody. Peace on earth, and all that crap. Who is this drunken kaffir? - What're you doing here? - Who is this fucking Boer? What did he say? I'll kill him. And you, you're a disgrace to your people. Get out of my house. Sorry, man. I fucked up your Christmas. You're stinking drunk. Yeah. That's right. Dead right. Put the kaffir in his place. You bastard! Stop it! You can't say that to me, Stanley. Emily is dead. They came to take her to Zululand. She refused to leave. They took her babies and put them in the truck. She ran after them... and fought with them to get her babies back. They beat her. Her heart gave way. What a pretty picture. A drunken kaffir and an Afrikaner traitor. You deserve each other. Johan? I don't wanna go, Ma. Please stay. - Do as I tell you. - Let him stay, Susan. For now. "I have written this on behalf of Gordon... "and Emily and Jonathan Ngubene, who were murdered. "From all of them I have learned what I now know, and if by writing this... "I can change even one man who is as blind to the world as I have been... "then I'll have given some meaning to my life. " I haven't been much help, Johan. But you've done wonderfully well. - It's going to be a beautiful horse. - Thanks, Pa. You're a very clever young man. You've seen and heard everything, haven't you? Yes, Pa. And if anything were to happen, you would know what to do, wouldn't you? Yes, Pa. I've written everything down. So have the others. Stanley knows where the papers are hidden and what to do. - I'll give you his telephone number. - I understand, Pa. Do you understand how proud I am of you? I'm proud of you, too, Pa. Now I shall show you where the papers are hidden? I'm sitting on them. Hold this. You take the screwdriver. The papers are there. Put it inside. Hello, Pa. Hello, Suzette. Here. Come on, Johan. I thought you were gonna be waiting at the gate. - But you're early. - Come on. Ma's in the car. How is she? She's all right. I'm sure she's waiting for you, Pa. I doubt it, darling. - Hello, Susan. How are you? - Fine, thank you. Hi, Ma. - Pick you up here later. - Sure. Come on. Good boy. You like that, don't you? Yes, yes. That's the one who came to the school, Pa. Leave us alone, Johan. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit. I've brought back your papers. Will you sign for them, please? Hello, Johan. Thank you. May I come in? What do you want? - You're not very hospitable today. - What do you want? I want to talk about survival. Mine or yours? - Survival. - Survival. They buried Emily Ngubene today... and you want to talk about survival. Meneer Du Toit... there's a line you should not cross. I'd like to convince you of this. Goodbye, Captain. But he certainly ain't yours or mine. Right, Grandpa? Get down, Johan! Oh, God. You all right? - Melanie. - Ben. I need your newspaper to publish the affidavits. - There's no time left for a lawsuit. - What's happened? - Will they? - Yes. What's happened? They shot at my house tonight. They nearly killed my son. - Is he all right? - He'll be all right. Where is he now? - I had to take him to his mother. - And? And nothing. I can't go back. - Did you want to? - Don't be silly. I can't. All my references have switched. Nothing, nothing is the same anymore. - I know. - No, you don't know. You can't. I went along with them. You never did. I went along with them. I believed their lies. But your son won't. You beat me. Johan, stay back! Bastards. Pa, the papers. I fooled them. They didn't find my secret place. I hid them when Suzette saw us. She told them, Pa. No, Johan, we can't be sure. Your attention, please. Arriving passengers on Zambia Airways, flight 91 from Lusaka... please proceed to information at baggage area B. Miss Bruwer? Come with me. Please pick up the nearest telephone in the lobby area. Thank you. Excuse me. - You are Stanley? - Yes. Hello? - What's up? - Stolz is at Melanie's. Get down. Hey. Very impressive. Where's Melanie? On her way to London. They're deporting her. Jesus. She knew what she was doing. Wellington's affidavit. - Then you saw her? - She's fine. We'll see her again. - Where are the other papers? - Safe. This is all we need. We'll take those to our friend at the newspaper tonight. Not you, man. You know Stolz will be on your ass every minute. That's what I'm planning on. I'll be the decoy. - Hello? - Suzette? Hello, darling. No, I'm fine. I don't sound it? Well, we've had a break-in. - At the house? - No, just the garage. Was anything taken? They were looking for some things that I'd hidden there. - Did they find them? - No, they didn't find anything but... I need a safe place for them. - Why don't I look after them? - Would you? If you like. That would be perfect. I'll come and get them. Not here. We'll meet at the Pizza Palace at 9:00. Could you make it 8:00? Thanks. - See you then, darling. - I love you. Me, too. Bye. Those are the papers. Someone will come by tomorrow and pick them up. - Two coffees, please. - Pie? - Yes. - No. I'm sorry to burden you with all that. You look lovely. Thank you, Pa. How are things at home? Just fine. The rocking horse won't be ready for little Piet's birthday. You know... I've still got that little hippopotamus you made me. - You do? - Yeah. - Suzette. - Yes? - I love you. - Me, too. - I better go. - No, don't go. I must. Pa. - Darling. - Take care. Yeah. You ordered two coffees. I know. Don't worry, Mevrouw Klopper. Please. The door, Mevrouw Klopper. Here are the papers, Captain. Thank you. - Our country needs more people like you. - Burn them. Do what you like to them. I just want everything back to normal. Thank you again, Mevrouw Klopper. So, Johan, ride carefully. Bye-bye. They got the papers. Well done, little lani. Ripped by: SkyFury
