You want more for putting in some screws? She didn't tell me anything. I thought she was still here. Look, Mr. Barrionuevo... We have two options here: One is that you bring us the baby, and we send her to a children's home. And when they ask us who brought her, we'll tell them it's you. Maybe your picture will appear in the newspaper for being a good citizen... But... there is another option, which I think is best: Take full responsibility. It's not my responsibility. You don't know where the Cajamarquina is? I told you I have no idea. Let me know if you see her. This child can't stay here. I'll have to charge you. If Madame sees her, she'll kill me. There is a feeding bottle in the kitchen. What a cunt... "Poor isn't someone who has little... but someone who wants a lot." Talk to your landlord. You can't live on the streets! Done.

I wouldn't ask you otherwise. I always pay you back. You owe me quite a lot. Do you have anything of value as a warranty? Does this cover it? It's OK. What do you want? How much can you give me for this ring'? 35 soles. Last time, you gave me 50 for it. I don't have time. I have to leave. And that baby? She's not mine. I found her on the streets. I saved her life. That kind of crying is not normal. Can I come in? She has a rash, of course she's crying. Bring me a cloth. What a shame... Look how he has me... A clean one. And water. Yes, it's not fair...

Let's see if you like this. - Don't take so long. - Wait, I'm just checking. I have a party later on... 2,000 soles? It's not for gambling this time, I swear. Let's go. Just leave the money and let's go. Wait a little longer. Let's go, don't be like that. We have to wait to pick up... How much do you need? 100? You have to give me something as a warranty. You have to give me something as a warranty! What? The shower is broken. You have a bucket there. I'll only need you for a week. Here you have towels, blankets and sheets. The oven doesn't work. The baby can sleep with you on the sofa, you can put your stuff here. Don't worry, I have few things. I live nearby. I'll need a few hours so I can bake my nougats. I can stay as long as you want. What a beautiful dress! Did you buy it? I pay on the 15th. If you lose the key, it comes out of your salary. Take care of the shopping, ask for receipts. Justify everything. Darling, wings, neck and giblets separated. And I'll take the gizzard... My husband loves it. - Shit! - What's wrong? Where did you find this bill? In your pants. The ones I washed. How could I've been so stupid... It's all that thing's fault. Don't talk about your daughter like that. Where are you going? Come by on Friday so you can talk to Brenda.

Friday it is. Hurry UP... Bed number 11. One hour left for visits. Do you think anyone will notice if I sleep over? Tell him to pay us with change. We don't have any change. Thank you.

"Broad and alien is the World. " Eventful journey, heroic deed." risk. Ll Every dog has its day. " "A good death does honor to a whole life. " "There's no fool like an old fool. " Maybe you could help me... Help you with what? Well, I'm not really sure... I know she's being taken good care of here. You said it and it's true. But you've also said that... when she's with me, she feels better. So, when you... send her out, hopefully she won't... - You're Brenda, right? - Yes. Why? Do you want something special? I urgently need to find the Cajamarquina. Juanita told me you have some information about her. That information has a price. - How much? - 50 soles. I imagine that includes you... No. My services included, it'll cost you double. Don't you have a smaller bill? I don't have change. Just the information. You can find her in the Cono Sur. The Cono Sur is big. In Pamplona Alta, at Madame Raquel's. Everybody knows her. Taxi! To the Cono Sur, Pamplona Alta. Will she take any longer? She's cleaning herself up, she won't be long. You can come in. Wait, I'm going in first. Sit down and take off your clothes. Where is the Cajamarquina? Why are you looking for her? I need to give her something back. That information will cost you. Fine. How much? 50, minimum. Does that include you? 70 soles and I'll give you the full service. You have to go to the Mariscal Hotel, Huari Street. The Cajamarquina is working there. Here it is. Come on, take off your clothes. I can't Pa) YOU... You'll have to wait. I want to pay but I can't. You shouldn't let people smoke inside. It's as though the baby were smoking. Go back to the bedroom. I'm working. Saw, saw The Woodsmen of San Juan... Can I pay you back doing some work? Your work is no good to me. What happens if I don't pay you? If you want to find out, try me! It's your choice. Let's see, Milagritos... Yes, like this. Can you tell me where you were last night? Where is the stool I had here? In the bathroom. Put it back in its place. Here is a list of medicine for the child. We're here already. One... and two. You're babysitting? Sort of. She's Clemente's daughter. - The pawnbroker's son? - Yes. I understand. What do you understand? Is it true that the child's mother is a hooker? I've heard it's not the first child you've had with a hooker. I only care for your well-being and the child's. That number doesn't exist. How come? It doesn't. Huari St. ends here. You were given a wrong address. Wait here. Do you know the Mariscal Hotel? There are no hotels here. This is an industrial zone. Let's go. Where to? I don't know. The street ends here... There must be a Huari St. In another district. This is the only Huari St. Don't be an idiot. Look well. Watch your language. Why don't you treat me with respect? I'll stay here. Take the money. - I can't accept that bill. - Accept the money. I won't accept that bill. This is the only bill I have. Take it. She looks like Clemente. I don't care whose daughter she is. I can see that from miles away. She needs someone to take care of her. Done. Here. Thank you. How's Rosa doing? The hospital wants documents that prove we've lived together. That's why they won't let me take her out. And how do you do that? I don't know. With money, a notary, witnesses... I don't know, I guess it costs a lot of money. Why do you complicate matters? They take care of her at the hospital. You don't even have a home. I complicate matters because she's my girlfriend. I need these. That'll be 45 soles. This bill is useless. You're the pawnbroker's son, right? I know you. Take the medicine, you can pay me later. They make them more difficult each time. I'll fill this in for you for free. Thank you, Don Fico. Can I eat another omelet? Of course. You have to eat. You're too skinny. But leave one for Clemente. He likes omelets and gizzards. Good morning, Clemente. Some sweet bread? How come that bitch isn't here? Brenda is out. Where is that fucking bitch? Lower your voice. Don't show disrespect to anyone, we never did. - Something wrong, Juanita? - No, everything's fine. What happened? They've been lying to me and stealing from me. Money? Yes, money. All of you. You, Brenda, the Cajamarquina. All of you! If the Cajamarquina doesn't show up, you'll have to keep the baby. We can't be here chatting all day... Are you going to need my services? I'll have to charge you. - One more week. - No. 20 % interest is too much! You accepted. No one forced you. I won't break the deal, but give me one more week. What is it to you? Please. One more week. I don't need you any more. You'll leave at the end of the month. Alone, you won't handle this. You work all day. I'll get by. It isn't a good idea. The baby needs someone to take care of her. I've found her mother. The hooker? Hooker or not, she is the mother. And why hasn't she come to pick the baby up? I'll take her myself. Here are the 5,000 soles. That's all the money I owe you. It's been a good month, thank God. So... everything is settled? Your water, Clemente Can I have my watch back? No. That guy you sent me, doesn't want to pay me back. Julian? Little Julian! He must be going through a bad patch, but he'll pay you back, don't you worry about it. I'm not worried. You're the guarantor. The baby isn't mine. I found her on the street. I saved her life. You'll get me into trouble. I'll leave the baby in my living room. I can say that I got hit and lost consciousness. If you help me out... I'll cancel your debt and here are 300 more. You won. I'm going to have to start believing in the Lord of the Miracles. Hide the newspaper, I don't want Clemente to see it. Aren't you happy? Yes, of course. I told you if I won I'd give you something. Forget it. What I need is for Clemente to give me my money. He sure is good with money all right. That's how he was brought up. What about you and him? In total, you have like... 2,620 soles. I trust you Can you both go to the bedroom for a moment? Don't worry about us, your money is still in the oven. Sign here. I have a pen. Wait. Just like your father. Better than a bank. You're going to need this. Hide it inside the pillow case. Don't forget what's mine. Don't worry. That's been taken care of. Would you do the same thing? It depends. You're doing it for her or for yourself? Happy birthday, Clemente. Happy birthday. Take it. It's from all of us. The picture now. Take the baby. Ready? Let's cut it. Do you like it? Haven't I been clear? Let's see, slowly. Be careful. Tilt her back. What's wrong? It never happened to you before. Just open it, it's been fixed. You can't stay the same way your whole life. Good morning. Here is what I owed you. Are you looking for something? How much is that? - The blue one? - Yes. 200 soles. It's imported. I have domestic ones. It costs 50 soles and smells the same. Tomorrow is the final procession of the Lord of the Miracles through the streets of Lima. The Lord of the Miracles will salute its worshippers until the next month of October... Maybe being carrion vulture contributed to being... Where's the baby? Wasn't I supposed to take her?
