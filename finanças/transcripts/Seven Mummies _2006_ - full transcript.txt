Which way is to the border, the Mexico border? You speak English? - Do you speak Apache? Trade for water. Trade for water. Ah. You seek Tumacacori? - What? - Tumacacori, lost gold. - What the hell is this fool talking about, man? Seriously, what's up? - You wish to return the medallion. - We're looking for the border. - (sighs) I ain't looking for no border, man. You got something to eat, some food? - Plenty food. Plenty food. - Some damn snakes, man. I ain't eatin' that. - You a real Indian? (frightening music) (singing in foreign language) (laughing) - What'd he start singing? - He started singing a death chant, man. - He must've seen something. Nah, but he's singing that we're all gonna die and shit, you know what I'm saying? - Come on, let's eat. - I heard those things tastes like chicken! - Let me get some of that right quick, dog. - Shit ain't half bad. - Nah, nah, nah. Wash it off a little bit though, you know what I mean? - Fuck that shit. - Fuck it. Eat it dirty. - So why haven't you made your break? - Safety in numbers. Until we get to the border. You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I will tell you the legend of Tumacacori, the story of the lost gold. - You talking about treasure? - Seven mummies and seven gold medallions. The directorio of Tumacacori has been known for over 500 years, since the Spanish first enslaved the Hohokoham people, and forced them to free the treasure from the Guachapa Mountains. Below the mountain pass were twelve arrastas and twelve patias. The arrastas were used to crush the ore, and the patias were used to screen the mountain clay from the gold before crossing the wild river. The treasure was hidden deep in the vast desert. And seven Jesuit priests were sworn to protect the secret location. For almost 400 years no one came. Then a small town was built over the site where the white man came to dig in the desert. The town still stands, a place that can only be found when the day and the night are of equal length everywhere at once. Return the seventh medallion and there will be more gold than 10 men can spend in 10 lifetimes together. - What? - Hey, dog, what's this fool talking about, man, seriously? - I don't know. - Border is that way, gold is that way. - I'm with the gold, homie. (smacks hands) I'm out. (laughing) (eerie music) (gunshots blasting) - I'm not dying! I'm not! (thuds) Stop following me! (screaming) (gunshot blasts) (breathing heavily) (gunshots blasting) (shouting) (whimpering) - Crazy old man was right. - Hey dog, we finally ran into a town. Hey, let's go get the gold, yo. - Wait, just wait. Everybody gets equal splits, except for I'm taking Blade's share. - Hell no, you not, dog! - I'm not feeling that, homeboy. - Hey, this ain't a democracy! You two got a problem with that? - As long as we make us rich, I don't give a fuck. Better just quit your bitching, homie. - And I guess you don't have a problem? (dramatic music) (horse whinnies) - It's always like that just before it drops. You, uh, just get in town? Saloon's the best place to be till after dark. Name's Kile. Come on in, I'll show you around. - Shit, you ain't gotta tell me twice. - You got pinot grigio? - You got tequila? What's up? (Old Western piano music) (chattering) - What's popping? Ooh! God damn, that shit looks tasty! (glass shattering) - This'll work! - Let's sit down and have a drink, dog, you know what I mean? - Let's kick it. - I'm thirsty. - Here, sit, yo. - [Patron] Shit, he's got one of my flavors. (laughs) - Compliments of the house. First and last one's always free. - I'll drink to that. - Hell yeah. Fill 'em up with that one. - Here's a little meat to put on your bones., ma'am. First and last one, always free. - Hey, sir, sir, Bartender, I like this girl over here. - I'd die to see this one here. She looks like Maria, the bitch I was telling you about back home, you know what I mean? (suspenseful music) - Stay calm. - Ma'am. So how you boys doing? Any of you fellas see that sign out there, the one that says I got to register you're here in the town before you get all kinda settled in? - Well, we're new in town, and I didn't see no sign. (hammer clicks) - Well, that's the law, Sheriff's order. - Let's arrest 'em, Cap! (hammers clicking) Let's kill the fuckers. - Mr. Drake, that bright sun was truly blinding. Why don't we give our young visitors here some time to adjust to our generous civil behavior? (laughing) - The light was low on our face. Ain't that right, baby, hmm? - That sound about right to you? You couldn't see nothing, that's right? (sniffs) I believe I smell bullshit. (laughing) Funny thing, bullshit, thieves, liars, they all kind of smell the same. So I say to you, I say seek not the plunder that is buried in the evil earth. No, no, no, I say to you, I say lay up your riches in heaven! (laughing) However, I must confess, I surely do love and believe in a beautiful woman. Love pretty ladies. (laughing) I surely do believe pretty ladies. (kisses) Gentlemen, welcome to our little community. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Welcome to our little community. (laughs maniacally) You know what I say? I say that you're to enjoy the nice warm hospitality of our little town here. I say to you, drink all of these cold libations that you can! I say to you, to just simply take anything that you desire, because the darkness will be upon us, soon enough. (hammers click) - That's some trippy shit, dog, you know what I mean? They didn't even take us in and we got this shit on. - It's all for the show. A beer. - This dickhead's gonna get laid before us? - No, no, no. I don't know about you, dog, but I'm gettin' me a cowgirl or some shit, homie. - Yeah, I gotta get my boogie on. What's up, homie don't fuck around. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Pops, get over here. Bend over! - [Wallet] Get me at the bar, homeboys. - Man, don't ever trip, Wallet, I got you, homie. Let me get my mack on first, you know what I saying? What's your name, girl? Anna, it's that way? I'm gonna go with Maria, all right? And we'll keep it Mexican. - Don't hold back on account of me. - I don't fuck whores. I'm not interested in lying. Hey, you move again, and I gonna blow your stomach all over that wall. (growling) - Take me with you! (coyote howling) (upbeat hip-hop music) 25 years, murder, I wasn't supposed to get none of this!

I don't know where you come from, dog, but where I'm from, man, I ain't never seen no dead people walking, talkin' shit, and get up and chase us. - There's gotta be something inside one of these buildings. - Well, that's good.

It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. There ain't a shit out here, let's roll. - Yeah, a golden needle. - Pretty weird town, huh? Pretty weird town. - You don't know the half of it. (chuckles) - I shot myself in the foot. Say hello to my little friend. What do you make of this? That's not all I found. (roaring) (growling) - What's your hurry?

It goes on forever. - If we get out of here, what's gonna happen. - You can trust me. - So I say to you, I say seek not the plunder that's buried under the weakened earth. No, no, no, I say to you, seek treasures in heaven. - How do you get out of this town? - Come with me. - Oh, we got light. Oh, nice! (door creaks) (ominous music) - Heard you was leaving. - Now, that ain't polite. - I brought them just like you asked. - Where is the medallion? - What? - The gold coin? - They've got it. - The seven must be together again as one, Amen. - You don't understand. - I know they've got it. - We never had it! - Why do you lie to me, child? - I brought them just like you asked! - You stupid bitch. - But you leave me, bitch! - They took it! I know they did. - We don't want any trouble. We just want to leave town. - That's what they always say, every time, right before they die. - Just tell them where you put it. - I told you, we don't have it! (sword scraping) - Seven coins, seven priests, one medallion one priest, that's the way it's always been, and the way it's always will be. This here gold was forged in the very fires of hell. (door creaking) (door thuds) If you hold the seven together as one, then you hold in your hand the mystery and the power of the treasure in all its glory. Oh, girl! You should have told me where the medallion was. (screams) (thuds) Next. - Run! (grunting) (gunshot blasts) - Come on, Lacy! Come on, let's go! Get up! Come on! (sword scrapes) (moaning) My leg.

Now even your children's children shall have need of the Lord's blessing. - I gotta fucking rest, man. Whole lot faster. I can't fucking go on, man. Oh, shit! - Hey listen, you need to give 'em back that medallion. - Look, you need to shut the fuck up and tend to him, now! - Hey Rock! We're going around in circles, man. You got a plan? - I got a map. - He's got a map. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. - Fuck! - Come on, let's go. Oh, man. (grunting) (laughing maniacally) (ominous music) (gunshot blasts) (church bell rings) - [Lacy] What is it? - It's a diary. Jesuit priests would record their dead before they buried them under the church. - Like a crypt? - Exactly. - Turn this. (creaking) (grunts) It's locked. Again. (otherworldly music) Give me the flashlight. (breathing heavily) (grunting) - Come on! We gotta get the gold, man. (yells in pain) Okay.

Hey, do you think he's lasted? Let's pick his ass up. - I gotta rest, man. - Sit down, man. (groaning) (wood creaking) (grunting) (cracks) (ghostly music) - Oh shit! The fucking gold, man!

(gasps) (grunting) (slamming) - Oh my God. - Come on! Let's get out of here, Lacy! (growling) (screaming) (groaning) (gunshot blasts) (grunting) (gasping) (grunting) (screaming) - Just hurry! (crashes) (groaning) (crashing) (screams) (whimpering) (grunts) (screams) - Come on, let's get out of here! (sword scrapes) (demonic howling) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (winds blowing) (splatters) (blade scrapes) (footsteps tapping) - The very abyss in hell trembles at your coming. Even the dead stir in joyous anticipation, for you are wicked, and the wicked must be truly rewarded. So I give to you the great gift of all eternity in this sweet place of purgatory. (horse whinnies) The infidels land is filled with idols, yet it's written, "You shall cast out your idols "for they are sinful things of silver and gold, (sword scrapes) "made by your own hand." (horse whinnies) (motor revs) (doors slam) (heavy rock music) (horse whinnies) (horse whinnies) (horse whinnies) (sun whooshes) (ghostly howling) (horse whinnies) (men grunting) (horse galloping) (blade scrapes) - No! (splattering) (horse whinnies) (maniacally laughing) (heavy rock music)
