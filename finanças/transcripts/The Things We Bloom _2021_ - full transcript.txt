I just want to ask you some questions about it. Cellmates with who? Quinn Thomas. Look, even if I did remember who the fuck that is, I wouldn't tell you Jack shit. Come in my house like this. Didn't your parents teach you to knock? Just... Just answer my questions and I'll leave. No, I don't think I will. I will shoot you. Did the [indistinct] send you? Is that what this is about? No... No. Look, I'm not here to kill you, but I will if you don't tell me what I want to know. Well, I got to say, you've got a bizarre way of making friends. Tell me what I want to know about Quinn Thomas. Well, since you asked so nicely: go fuck yourself. I barely remember the punk. You were cellmates with him up until the middle of last year. Did he ever say anything about it? Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't. Either way, I really wasn't listening. Slide, your hands behind your back and put those on. Well, you're going to have to shoot me. [laughs] Look, uh... I haven't done this sort of thing before, but I do know how to pull the trigger. Oh, well, it takes a lot more than that to kill a man and if I'm being totally honest here, I don't think you'd really shoot me. [funky, upbeat music] So, Quinn, are your parents mad at you or anything? No. They're just glad I'm finally out of prison. I didn't belong in there. But the girl, she did die, right? - Kippen! - Yes. Yeah, yeah, she did die. Sorry, I didn't mean to... It's fine, it's not my fault. I had the light. Who was she? Just some girl. And the boyfriend lived? He did. He lived. He's got a few cuts. Just like... Just like me. Sorry. Nosier then I should be. Don't worry about it. Shit happens. That's what my cousin says. So, like he used to live in Baltimore, and he had this friend whose dad was a truck driver. Well, his dad ended up breaking both of his legs on vacation. So he was, like, stuck at home and like really hated it and started drinking a lot. Well, one night, he ended up getting really angry and threw a dinner plate at his wife. Right? So then she, in return, poured hot coffee in his lap, knowing that he couldn't get up. Well, he freaked out because the coffee was so hot and he fell over, landed on his wrist and broke it. So, like, a few weeks later, his wrist comes out of the cast and, like, into one of those braces. But his legs have healed so he can go back to work. Well, normally they don't let people with injuries drive, so he hid it from his supervisor until like one of the nights he was making a haul up to New York and it like just snowed like crazy the day before. So he like ended up sliding on like ice or something and couldn't get control of the truck because his wrist seized up. Well, then the truck like overturned and like crashed down into a ravine like next to the highway, right? And he wound up being paralyzed from the waist down and had to get his wrist amputated because like it got caught like between some metal in the dashboard or something. So now he's at home permanently on disability. [rain spattering] Jesus Christ. Yeah. Anyways. Pretty crazy, but I guess shit just like kind of happens. I don't know. I mean, if the guy just waited for his wrist to heal... Who knows? I'm going swimming. Hey. You want to go for a ride later? As long as you're not hiding a broken wrist from me. [splashing] Oh my God! Holy fuck, it's so cold! I don't think you understand the situation you put yourself into. So, let me spell it out for you. You don't want to fuck with me. I may be a nobody to you, just... Just something along the way of your quest. But to those people, those people who cared deeply about me in the high circles of a very nasty, but lucrative business, I'm untouchable. You understand that? Can you understand that kid? So that's why I'm giving you the opportunity to get the fuck out of my house right now. And we'll just chalk it up to, "sorry. Must have had the wrong address." I just want to know if Quinn ever talked about what he did. And if so, what kind of things did he say? Jesus! You're just a fucking kid! You're still green around the gills. That's why I'm willing to let this slide. I see a pain in your eyes. A pain I've seen a lot of. And let me tell you, when you start making decisions out of pain. It only leads to more of it. The fuck is that? If you don't answer my questions, Mr. Alvaro... Whoosh. You haven't got the fucking balls! [yelling] Jesus Christ! Goddamn, you motherfucker! You're dead! You're dead! [ominous music] I just want to know what Quinn told you, if anything, about why he was in prison. Do that and I'll leave you be or don't and I'll watch you burn. He killed some girl while driving high on painkillers, or coke or something. What did he say about it? I don't know. He... He said it was no big deal. It wasn't his fault. He was driving fine. He wasn't even that high. She... She ran a red light, it was bad luck. That's what he said? What else? He knew he'd get out soon. He didn't think he belonged in prison in the first place. I'm sure you know who his dad is. Did he show any remorse? I mean, was he sorry for what he did? Did he know her fucking name? Fuck, I don't know. Ask him. I plan to. Why? Are you going to kill him over a girl? And what? You think you're gonna get away with this? Do I look like I want to get away with it? I think you're trying to act like you don't. But really, this is all new to you. Even still, there's something about you. I take it she was your girl, huh? Well, killing him isn't going to change that. Not trying to change it. Then what... what are you doing? You playing God or something? Everything we do ricochets, Mr. Alvaro. It bounces along and everything else, and it has the ability to tear the whole world apart. I'm so tired of no one taking accountability for what they do. We're all accountable. Every time. All the time. And you don't think that this, what... what you're doing right now is going to ricochet off of you or into someone else. Or do you just not care as long as you have your justice? You hadn't thought of that, had you? Well, However you put it, revenge is revenge. And your actions, however minor, have consequences. You're, no, exception. [grunting] Motherfucker.
