Here's to you. No, look into my eyes as we clink glasses. You're sure you're twenty? I'm sure you're nearer thirty. Thirty-three. Like Jesus Christ. You're right, it's good to lie. I was such a liar at your age. As long as you don't take Jesus? name in vain. Take it easy. Not yet. Let's not go at it like animals. You have to take it easy for Mummy to get hard. Just relax. Take your top off slowly. That's it. That's the question, isn't it? What gives us a hard-on? Young virgins have trouble getting it up. It's their first time. Queens like me have trouble getting hard for mechanical reasons. Why do you get hard? For me...? Or for bread? That's it. Bread gets you hard. You're right. I've an old queen friend who... For her, a trick with a twink is like a session with a shrink. The more she pays, the more it excites her. Paying gets her hard. You're a brave boy, though. I admire you, hustling in the woods in the depths of winter. You've got balls! At least, I hope so. I must stop. I get it from my mother. She could talk the hind leg off a donkey. Like Guitry said: women go on and on and on and on until they have something to say. Like queers! We go on and on and on! I'm annoying you. I'll shut up. Music! Roy Orbison. You know him? This is an original. Oh, gosh. How young we were! We weren't scared to dress in white. The essence of youth: not being scared to dress in white. I'll just go and freshen up. Make yourself at home. Take it easy. Change the record. It's too old, it often does that. Clear off! What are you up to? Working. You! Pull the other one. You're older than my clients. Get lost! There's room enough for two. They'll think we're together. Fuck you. Right! Hey... Hey! What happened? I'm dead? No you're not. Look... See, you can stand up. It's dangerous on your own, here. You're young. Be careful. How old are you? Dunno. What's your name? Leave me alone. - Were you attacked? - They took everything. Come on. Come on! Taxi! - It won't be easy. - What? We're filthy. Forget taxis. No matter. Go if you want to. What about you? I'll wait here. I want to be alone. As you wish. Bye. Clear off! I said clear off!! I know him. He's sick But I have to go somewhere. Come to my place, then. Ow! It hurts. Whoever did this really messed you up. Will you help me? Sure. What am I doing now? Yeah. And tomorrow? We'll see. We'll get organized. Is all this so we sleep together? Don't you want to? No. I don't want much right now. Wow! You've got soft skin. I haven't stroked skin this sweet in ages. Right now it's mainly old skin. Old and wrinkly, all flaccid. It's weird, the uglier the skin, the more they like being stroked. You should stroke people you like. Stop stroking me like that, I feel like a dog. No. I'm the dog. Look... What's this? An angel, that's cute. "Ange" would do. What? You won't tell me your name. I can't keep calling you Hey! No, I don't like "Ange". "Angel"? Sounds more American. You prefer that? No, too girly. Angelo... Angelo? Yeah, I like that. Angelo's okay. Okay. I hereby baptize you... In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! You okay? You were thrashing around. Open your mouth. Let it melt under your tongue. It'll do you good. Sleep. Something wrong? You lied about your age. You saw my photo on the net. It's not a current photo. Forget it, I'm not paying. Half, at least. 40 for the trouble. It was me who came here. And half's too much. You're too old. Get a new job. Get lost. Hey, money first. More. I reckon this suits me. Buy what you want, it's your money. How much should I take off for rent and food? Depends how much you want. I'm not your pimp. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. I could make loads with clothes like this. Here, look... Perfect. I don't know about the shoes. They feel too big. No, they're fine. And you're young, you've room to grow. I'm not even sure about the shirt. Choose one you like, I'm bound to like it. If you like. - Go and tell his mate. - OK. I think you should come back later for the fittings. What? There's a problem with your friend. Okay? No. I told you to put a dressing on. Shit! I think we'll take this one. We've no choice. Come to the till. Don't just stand there, Angelo, get changed. We'll go see the doctor. No, I don't want to. - It could get infected. - It's nothing. We have to do something. Not a doctor. I don't want to go to hospital. I'll be with you. What if they decide to keep me? I know someone. Come on. Your turn, Angelo. Does it feel a bit numb? No, it's okay. Right. What's the matter, then? I was attacked and injured. This wound especially, it keeps on bleeding. Yes, indeed. That's perfect. How were you attacked? I don't want to talk about it. Where was it? The Bois de Boulogne. When was that? A few days ago. Okay... Lie down. Take off your shorts. Good. Listen, first I'll check if you've been assaulted internally. The outside wounds are obvious. Then I'll put stitches in your elbow and we'll finish with an x-ray. Right... spread your legs. Spread your legs wide. It's cold. No, that's the lubricant. So it slides in without chafing. Smooth as silk! Extraordinary. Pure silk! Don't worry... everything's normal. No internal bruising, no cracks. Now you'll have to be brave. Hush! It's all right. Vassili, come through! It?s all over and done with. He's a strapping boy! - You OK? - Yeah. Did it go well? - It didn't hurt? - No. What wouldn't I give to be your age today! Come here then! Come on. No, just look at me. What would I do between you two? It'd be pathetic. An old queer like me has to invent other pleasures. Here, fill this bag up while I do his x-ray. And then we'll be through. Could you make me a cocktail like last time? With stuff that gets you going. Last sight-seeing I did was with my family Visiting the capital was a big deal to then, First time they'd left home. And the last. It went really badly. Have you seen them since? Don't want to. We fell out. I don't know if they're still alive, it's been that long. Even if they are, they're far away. You came to get away from them? You're not a real Parisian? And you're a real what? A runaway, a thief? You never say. Are you over 18? Where are you from? I'm just Angelo. Born a few days ago in a wood. The rest doesn't count. Before you, before here... I was dead. I lived near Grenoble. As I was gay, I just wanted to come to Paris, meet guys and fuck. Fuck my brains out. Lots want to be famous, be on TV and all that bullshit. I just wanted to fuck. And I was spoilt for choice. This city's a whorehouse when you're young and into sex. You're the king! I know: But when you're not the king anymore? It's the kind of question I never asked. But I should have. A queer's age is like a dog's. You multiply it. When you're over 30, you're through. Not if we love each other. Can you see us okay? I'm after a good time. Can you travel? We can. Where do you live? Near Bastille. How much do you charge? - 350 euros. - OK. But all night for that price. Sorry, but I don't think I'm into 3. What do you want, then? Him alone. OK. But it's the same price. Price isn't a problem. Come this way. You can watch TV next door. No, thanks. I have cable. So what? See you back home. - Your boyfriend? - Yeah. You deserve better. - He doesn't force you, does he? - No. Shame you're not taller. You'd be a real god. Come, let me lick my little god's feet. Bye! Bye. Thanks. Taxi! Angelo! Angelo? Handsome guy, buff, hot ass, hot dick, for good time. My place or yours. Handsome guy, buff, hot ass, for good time. My place or yours. Yeah. Mature bear, 45? Can you hear me? Ask for a duo, then. I can't hear you. Yeah, bye. I'm available. Dick for rent. I do anything but bareback, scat. Yeah, piss is okay. Like I said, thirty! No, I don't looker younger or older. Hello. Hello? Fucker! Handsome guy, buff, available. Handsome guy, buff, hot ass, hot dick, for good time. Fucker! Fuck, you can't be alone, even here. You freaked out my client. The fucker's gone. I'm sorry. Wait, don't go! Are you gay? I've never seen you here. Why? Are you here often? Almost every night. But it's risky, and you're young and pretty. You get attacks here. Especially at weekends. I'm an Arab, see. They think I'm like them, here for some queer-bashing. Wait, I'll wash my hands. I usually make Whites pay. Young or old, I don't care. With Arabs, I do it for free. You're not a real White. There's something about you. You're too good for this place. I don't get it. You're here, aren't you? I'm not the same. Are you shacked up with someone? Yeah. Well, I was. I came thinking I wouldn't go back but now I'm not sure. I think I'm missing him already. You're in love, it's obvious. Yeah. So what's your name? Angelo. That's your twink name. What's your real name? Angelo. It's my real name. I'm Said. Or Kamel. Or Karim. Sometimes Gaetano. When Arab's boring, I'm Italian. I wear classy threads and slick my hair back like this. - Looks the part, eh? - Yeah. You want to fuck? Well... I'm with someone. And you're right, I don't want to lose him. I should have shut up. Would you if I paid? That's different. What a slag! I've never paid but I'd get off on doing it with you. How much do you want? Whatever. As long as you pay. Even 20? If you like. But not here. Your burst the fucking condom! Do you have Aids? No, I've done the test. I'll show you. I don't know where it is. Fucking faggot! I'm married with kids! Chill, I'm careful... Vassili? Piss off! Dirty fucking fags! Where've you brought me? This is a madhouse. What happened? Right... I think we should do this later. Don't be uncool. I came here especially. I knew you were weird. Wait over there. I'll be right back. So what happened? Nothing, thanks to you. Lucky you arrived. Were quits now. You can go if you want. Why do you say that? You'd be better off with kids your own age. He's just a client. So? You could go off with him. He's cute, young. You owe me nothing. You're talking nonsense. Why stay? Out of pity? No. You don't pity me like this? Dressed up, with a bloody nose! Look at me! So why are you staying? Because you make me hard. Hey, have you forgotten me? I'll tell him to go if you want. No, go on. He's cute and he's paying. I said go on. Wait. I'm up for it. Hang on. Don't you fancy a threesome? Is he paying? I do it free for you, you do it free for him. Okay. Look after him, though. It's not just me. I know what a threesome is. I'm a pro. Get on the desk. On your back. Put this on. Breathe deeply. Stick it in. Stick it in. Go on! That's it. There. That's all the way. Look. That's a whore! He's doing my head in. I don't trust him. Shall we do a runner? Get on the desk, on all fours. Take your fucking rat and give me the money, now! You can go if you want. I wouldn't harm you. What are you dreaming about? Tell me. I'd like you to dream about us. And everything in your dream turns out nice. And we're the same age, because being older bothers you. And we have an ordinary life. Far away from all this. Another life. But even in another life, even in a dream, I'll still love you. You're trembling. Hold me tight, as if you wanted to choke me. I'm scared. Your heart's beating so loud I can't feel mine. Hold me tighter. That's it. That feels good. Sleep. I'll watch over you. Why did you arrive too late? We'd have had such a life. No. We will have such a life! Same again? Two whisky-and-cokes. Coming up! 15 euros, please. Who's the guy you're with? My boyfriend. That's the guy who attacked me. - Sarni! - Yeah? Who's the guy over there? Those two guys are looking at you. Shall we go over? You're wrong. They must be looking at you. No, honestly. Check it out. Grab your jacket. Pretend you're going for a smoke. I'll explain later. It was a guy I did. I thought I'd killed him. - He recognized you? - Yes! Fucking hell! Stop it... Shit! Stop it. We have to get out of here. Where? You want to come? Bravo! Once she's released, you'll find our magic waitress Anna at the bar. Don't forget, if your tips are magic, she'll be back for another number with our magician, Jim's Etoile. Vassili, why are you here? It's grandma. What do you mean? It's always grandma! She sends me to bed early. It pisses me off. Don't say such things. You say it. She's your grandma. Show respect. - And she's your mum. - Enough. Let's go. No, up the stairs to bed. Go on. - Will you tuck me in? - With this crowd? Nadine's opening tomorrow. You can sleep in. Goodnight. Come on in. What's your name? J?r?mie. Come here. Do I scare you? No. Then come closer. Don't touch the animals. You hear? Yes, but he's Bienplus, my dog. You mustn't stroke it - Bienplus? - So Mum'll buy it. What do you say? I need a bigger house. They're cute, but they grow. I hope we'll have moved by then. I offered you a hamster or a rabbit. Huh! They're not real animals. If you like the dog, don't stroke it. Germs can kill puppies. Have a nice day. Same to you. Come on love. Stop playing around! You never know when to stop. Wash yourself, then. No, I want you to do it, Mum! - Promise you'll let me? - It's a deal. You really are at the silly age. Rub me there, I like it. I want another one here. Oh, there you are. It's only water, Mum. You know what I think. Vassili's at an age where it's unhealthy for you to wash him. I was shampooing his hair. Then dress him first, don't leave him naked. He's a 10 year-end boy! What are you thinking? When you were his age, your father didn't wash you. If you didn't trust him, that's your problem. Of course I did, may he rest in peace. There's an age when girls are looked after by their mother and boys by their father and... Yes, carry on. And I believe Vassili has reached that age. "Sporty man with Latin charm, around 40. "Loves the outdoors and traveling. Good position. "Seeks a woman to share strong emotions and discoveries. "Children accepted." You're wasting your time. Unless you want one for you! Does he accept grandchildren? I can't really see you camping in the desert. Think of the boy. He needs a father, a home, a life. I'm fine, I don't need a father. What for? So he can piss Mum off? I don't want a father. They're crap and they piss everyone off. He'd teach you to speak properly! One day you'll marry and have kids. You'll be a father too. Rubbish! I don't want children. Am I moving too much for you? No, I don't mind you moving. Anyway, my drawing's a bit weird. Look... Not bad! Now you show me. Not bad either. Does Anna still live here? - Who is it? - I don't know. Vassili, go to your room. I want to speak to your mother. If it's one of your dates, you see to it. I don't want any. You've done nothing wrong? What are you on about? I don't know. There's one very young man and the other may be a cop, I've no idea. Don't tell me you're at it again! Maybe it comes with age! - You let them in? - No, they just came in. What a surprise! - This is Angelo. A friend. - Delighted. Sit down, boys. Come in here, Mum! You scared my mother. We're not used to men. What's this about Vassili? Vassili is my little man. Vassili? Vassili's my son. Come here, Vassili! I'll go and fetch him. What are you doing in the dark? Just playing. Mummy wants to introduce you. Coming. "Mummy wants to introduce you." What are you up to now? Still ducking and diving. The usual. - You? - I'm a magician's assistant! Yes, honestly. Here's my little man. - Don't just stand there, say hello. - Hello. And shake hands, like a grownup. - You know what his name is? - It could be anything. Vassili, the same as you. You don't seem pleased. He was my best friend when I lived in Paris. Has the cat got your tongue? You're really cute. I hope you're not my dad! How dare you! Why are you here? A holiday with a friend in the Dr?me. It takes a miracle to get you out of Paris! It's been quite a while. See, your mum's vanished. Rubbish, it's not real. Are you sulking? Why are you sulking? I'm not! Then answer when I talk to you. We haven't come to steal your mum, have we, Angelo? I'll tell you a secret. Then you'll be sure I'm not your dad. OK? Angelo and I are in love. - No! - I swear. Proof it, then. Proof it! Proof what? Proof it's true. With a kiss. See. You're lying. That's not a real kiss. Not a love kiss. See, it's true. Here, taste this. Strong, isn't it? It's whisky. Look, he's asleep. Come here. Come on. Don't be embarrassed. Not after all we got up to in Paris. But, cold like that, it's weird. Here... It's been ages. Good. You'll come up quicker. I missed you so much. I've often wanted to leave it all, even my son, and go back to the life we had. You mustn't regret it. Our old life is no more. Come on. You want me to rinse you? Yeah, sure. Here. Here we go. Move forward a little. - Hi there. - Hi. - No school today? - No, it's the holidays. Isn't Anna here? She's shopping with Grandma. They'll be back around noon. We've time to kill. What do you fancy doing? I don't know. Do you want to see a movie? Play a video game? Eat? No, none of that. I only want one thing. What? Follow me. Damn, they're back already. The light's on. It's not a problem. We left a note saying you were with us. Come on. What's up with him? Nothing. Right, Vassili? That wasn't too smart. What? Don't take me for a fool. Show me. Give him to the boys, they'll take him back. Don't worry, we'll stay together. Don't listen. She's mean. No, you're mean, disobeying me, tricking my friends. We don't care what she says. Listen to me! You win. I'll take him back to the store myself. Don't cry. Give me a cuddle. Shall we try? Let's go to my place, it's quieter. I'm out. Hang on, let's go to my place! Sure, but he goes too. I can't invite you. I'm married. - To a woman? - Yes. Never mind. Shame, I'd like a threesome. What about your place? Yes! No problem. We'll do it at my place. The more the merrier. Mind you, I'm over at Lyon Gerland. Okay. Shall we go? What's the code? 19-68. Right. See you at the hotel. I hope it's the right code. - Yes? - It's me. It's good. See you at the hotel? How good? Very, very good. You promise you've done nothing? I promise. See you. Oh, hang on... What? I love you. I love you too. With all that money, you end up like an asshole. I've met loads of bastards like you. I know your kind. Guys who corrupt everything they touch. You're so rotten you force me to break a promise. It's impossible to be pure with guys like you. See what a fine scar I have now? And look... We did it! Wait. I didn't keep my promise. Why did you do it? Those were my terms. I'd help you. But just to steal. We can't trust men like him. Can I trust you? Of course. I did it for us. We're nearly there. You'll see at Victor's. It'll all be over. Paradise awaits us. Till then, anything goes. Anything? Even against me? No, it's for you. To stay with you, so nothing can stop us. I love you. I know. We'll start again from scratch there. Wait till you're there, you'll see it's worth the trouble. Did you say goodbye, love? Goodbye. I'm going too. Oh yeah? Yes. I packed. You'd leave Mummy alone? She's got Grandma. Stop talking rubbish. You always say it?s good to travel. I have to learn how. It's not summer camp, there are no children and I doubt the boys want to look after you. I don't want to intrude, but I wouldn't wind. - What about you? - On the contrary. It'd be fun. We could take him for a few days. It'd give you a rest and mean we'd see you again. It's a very good idea. Get him out from under her feet. He's my son, I'll decide. It?s my home, I'll say what I think. That'll be 250 euros. What? 250 euros? Yes. It?s a long way from Lyon. Shit, I haven't enough cash. Can you sound your horn? Yeah, sure. Hello, lads! Good to see you! Okay? Did you have a good trip? Just a problem with the taxi. I didn't check the price. Oh, that's nothing. How much do I owe you, sir, for bringing me these charming creatures? 250 euros. Kamel, can you bring me some cash, please? Sorry, there are 3 of us. I didn't have time to call. No matter. He's Anna's son, my best friend who used to sing at Queen. It's better. She's a magician now. I've forgotten all that. Paris. Le Queen. The night life. It's all so far away. Anyway, you're welcome. You too, of course. Thank you. Midnight bathing is therapeutic. It relaxes before bed. It promotes sleep. It eliminates toxins. Fancy it? Yes, why not. What about the others? Vassili knows the house. They'll join us. Come on. Doesn't it make you feel good? The water temperature is perfect. And listen to that silence. Gorgeous! I always dreamed of growing old far from it all. An island would be ideal. A remote island somewhere in Asia. But at my age, health is an issue. And you need your health if you?re starting a new life. Vassili said you'd lived in America. In America and in Morocco. Yeah! Morocco and America. Two bustling countries. The bustle isn't quite the same nor is the hustle. But from New York to Tangiers it?s the same mad movement: getting off with a man who turns you on. You must be bored up here in the mountains. Not at all. On the contrary. It's perfect. A real no man's land. It suits me fine. I didn't want to be one of those oldsters who invade us by bus, boat and charter, discovering the world when all they can talk about is grandchildren, varicose veins and rheumatism. It's awful! Old age is too late for discovery. Discovery is interesting when you're young enough to change. But an old fart like me doesn't change anymore. But it's the right time to be satisfied, to enjoy life. So I enjoy it. I enjoy my garden, enjoy sport, this pool. - Dinner is ready. I enjoy my lover. Now we're talking! - It'll get cold. - Come in with us. We'll heat it up. Yum. Smells good! To reassure you, as you don't seem to get it, we won't take your mate. Just take the air. and enjoy life. So don't get worked up for nothing. Don't worry, I'm calm. And I trust Victor. We've been tested by lots of things and people and we're still together. So I'm not worried by you. Then what are you scared of? That he'll give you less money? You really want to know? Really? No, I don't care. He told me about you. You're part of a sordid period of his life. Guys like you almost killed him. We have no secrets between us. I know what you do. Yeah, the same as you. I whore around! No. Because I truly love him. He was my first client, a bit like a father. That's why he still pays my rent today. For a whore, you're a damn good cook. we?re usually only good at fucking, but... it's delicious. Thank you. I'll finish in my room. Is that allowed? Vassili, it's for you. Yes, I love you too, Mum. Take care. I'll put him on. Here, it's my mother. My mum's coming this weekend. She's bored without me. - Your mother's coming? - Yes. Only if it doesn't disturb you. Not at all. Don't I have a say? I can't see why you'd mind, but... - How long are you staying? - I don't know. As long as Victor wants us. It's up to him, it's his house. Same as you. Don't mind him, Kamel's like that. He finds it hard to trust, but it'll work itself out. - Up already? - The snow woke me. That's good, you can help me. - What are you doing? - Protecting the earth. You find it funny? It's important, you know. The more you give her, the more she gives back. Help me: grab the corners. That's it. Very good. Victor! Look what I found. A mole. It must have died of cold. That's good. That's one fewer. Why, is it bad? In the garden it destroys everything, but elsewhere it can be very useful. It's the same with us men. You have to find your place and get it right, otherwise... its curtains. Having a nice rest? Perfect. I feel good here. Imagine if all this were ours? We'd be fine. Come on, the water's gorgeous. It'd be great if we lived like this too. You wouldn't get bored? I don't think so. If we wanted a change, we'd travel. Ever made love in a pool? No, but I'm about to. - What are you doing? - Preparing my mum's room. Victor, can't you see what's going on? Don't you care what I think? These whores are taking you for a mug! - Why are you insulting us? - Shut up, you! Forgive him, he's upset. I'll be back in 5 minutes. I'm fed up with your behavior. And are they angels? They arrive with a kid, a taxi bill and now the family. They soon be asking us to leave. You always exaggerate. I exaggerate? Exaggerate what? You're having. You can't see it, you're blind! I don't like you speaking like that. The Tangiers bourgeoisie said the same thing about you. That I should be suspicious... A young boy interested in me may be dangerous. The difference is, I wasn't a worthless, profiteering whore. Of course you weren't. I don't see them like that either. How do you see them? What's so marvelous about them? Go on, tell me! Their dicks? Their asses? Is that why you worship them? We'll talk when you've calmed down. Right! Anyway, I'm leaving! Take me to the station. Calm down. It's ridiculous. I'll call a cab. We can find a solution. Talk about it together. I was almost like these guys and I know you'll get nowhere talking. Either they go, or I do. Wait... Wait! This is quite ludicrous! Are you sure this is what you want? Once again, I'm sorry. But we really need to touch base together. To take stock. You must have known that. When things go wrong and people are around it makes it worse. No, we've never known that. But this is your home. You don't have to apologize. It's odd for us, having so many guests. I refused to take on staff for that reason. As I get older I feel lonelier. I should have thought before I invited you. We'll leave tomorrow. It's not a problem. When will my mum come? She won't come. She'll be really disappointed. She'd have liked to have come. She took time off, she said. We'll invite you both in summer when it's warm. That'll be better. Eh, Victor? Yes. I'm off to bed too. Goodnight... and thanks again for everything. Stop crying. Like I said, it changes nothing. You cry too much. I wanted Mum to come. We'd have had a good time. She'll come. They don't want her to. Leave it to me. Open your mouth. Take this. Sleep well. When you wake up, it'll all be sorted out. - He's the same, you see? - What? Victor. He's just like all the rest. Close the door. Yes? Just going for one last dip. Coming? Go on, we'll join you. You're going? Well, yes. It's their last night. So what? Don't be long, we've unfinished business. Come on in. Real midnight bathing is naked. Everyone strip off! Why not? Trunks hide the thing that ages best on a man: his dick! You know... I think we'll stay. Angelo is busy persuading your old man. Goodnight. Go on in. It's your home too. Kamel! Come and give me a hand! Calm down. Stop trembling. I'm cold. I thought you'd do to me what you did to Victor. You're still my friend. We'll even make a promise to each other. But a real promise, though. Don't tell anyone what happened, not even Mummy. It's a secret between Angelo, you and me. Promise? I promise. Wake up, darling. My darling... Mum! Coming downstairs? Okay. See you there. He always got on well with kids. I asked him to recognize my baby. - Why? He's not the father. - No. He always said he wanted a child. So I asked him if he wanted to share mine. I thought it'd bring us closer. Bring us together, even. But he was scared, it had the opposite effect and we lost touch. So I went home to Lyon. You can't be a single swinger in Paris and have a child too. - He must regret it. - Maybe. I told you, darling, wear your hat outside. Are you crying? Why are you crying? I'm not. It's the cold. Then wear this, or you'll catch cold. What are you doing? You'll get all dirty. Protecting the earth. Victor taught me. Don't forget to thank him for having us. I sure will. Come in where it's warm. They killed my mother! They killed Victor. They killed everybody! Vassili! Let me go!
