So my father worked at the tea factory here and we lived in the company quarters Wait I will show you.. See This is your mom? No.. She is Kavita’s mom She was our househelp. Her name was actually Rekha but we called her Kavita’s mom since childhood So Ranjan uncle, Dad’s friend, he was selling his cottage very cheaply BECAUSE it was believed to be haunted Haunted?? Yes, it was believed that the house was haunted by a thirsty spirit.. Thirsty spirit!! You mean to say like those B-grade horror films where the ghost scares girls in shower No No.. It was believed that this thirsty spirit used to possess humans at night to drink water Hence, Thirsty spirit!! Wait a second!!! How can a dead feel thirsty? I don’t know Mom used to say that one should never disrespect the sprits and the god But dad never believed in all this but then.. Then?? We got the house blessed and shifted It was all going well only Then one night I was sleeping in my room Suddenly around 1am I woke up parched I saw Kavita's mom was going downstairs so I quickly got up and went after her. Who would have gone down alone!! As we reached down, Kavita's mom picked up a bucket and started walking towards the well I called her from behind but there was absolutely no reaction Then she put the bucket in the well and started drawing water I stood there watching I was scared out of my wits!! All the ghost stories started running in my mind.. Then what happened??? Then she picked up the bucket and started drinking water from it Seeing this, I started running towards the kitchen screaming And when turned the light on.. I saw Kavita's mom sleeping here So who was she?? Don’t know. Maybe the thirsty spirit!! Anyway leave it, so how did this "thirsty spirit" look?? Looked normal.. Normal??!! I mean her hand or leg wasn’t inverted? Witches have inverted legs not spirits! Wow you know a lot about spirits too.. Has anything like this ever happened to you? Means Means you know some supernatural incident.. Thankfully no!! But a few years ago a girl died at our property What?? How? Nobody knows What was she doing on your property? She was a guest She was there with her boyfriend And one morning a staff found her dead Dad called the local police we tried to find out but no legit reason could be known about her death Plus the boyfriend was also missing How did she look? I don’t know I was in London And you never even bothered to find out? I mean we didn’t want to get involved right!! WOWW!! You didn’t want to get involved.. A girl dies at your property and you didn’t want to get involved?? Our family was already going through shit! You should have given some shit about her too right?? We did what we had to...
