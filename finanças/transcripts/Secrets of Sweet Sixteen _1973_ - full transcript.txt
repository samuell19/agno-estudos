School's out early today. No one coming to pick you up? No You're walking? I always go home by myself Do you live far away? No, just down the street. Well, T'll walk a little way with you. Would you like some candy? No, I have to go home now. Oh, there's plenty of time you got out early. Do you like puppies? I have a little puppy at my house. It's very cute. You could play with it. Come on now, you come with me. We'll have to be very quiet. Otherwise the little puppy will wake up. How much farther to your house? Not far. Oh, no. Linda Now you sit down.. Would you like some candy? Yes. Come on. Hurry. I saw a man take a little girl into the basement. You like that? Mmm-hmm Now then, give me your school books. I have a nice surprise for you. Hurry, quick, come and phone the police You'll like it, the gift that I have for you. You said that there was a puppy to play with that you've got. I'll get it. Now, give me a little jacket first. He might jump up on you. Yes. And your blouse just.. Come back here, come back here Stop that! Quiet! Quiet! Mummy!! Listen..Listen to me.. Mummy!!! Stop that! Just stop screaming. It's alright. Just don't say anything. You haven't got a dog. You were lying. But I have one, you'll see. No, I didn't lie to you. I am not going to be put away again, you hear? Not another cell, not another cell. I am going to kill you both. But why do that? We won't tell anyone. We came to be with you. We're just delighted to have a real man. Yes. We've had our eyes on you for a long time now. You don't have to worry about us. We won't tell anybody. We promise you've gone to a lot of trouble, you know, to come here. And if we leave now, then it was all for nothing. You're safe down here in the basement. We bolted the doors and no one can get in. No one will bother us. In the cellar she said What's going on here? That man was attacking a little girl down here A Child Molester huh? Come on. On your feet. Come on. Typical case unfortunately I thought you'd be interested in it in your capacity as a school psychologist. Fascinating. A very interesting example of today's moral values. Yes, and it would appear, although indicating an apparent immorality that both girls still have their moral consciousness in tact Yeah, to go in and face such a danger as that.. shows that the protective instinct of women can overcome fear. And in this instance, I'm forced to admit also instinctively using charms which only women possess. If you mean the fact that they undressed. Yes. After all, it could have gotten them beaten or sexually abused. That's not the best situation to be in. Although, it makes the most fascinating theory. Both the girls obviously make love freely. And yet at the same time they come to the rescue of a younger girl in danger. It's one of the mysteries of our time. And if youth accepts it, then we must too. Yes. How very true. The young of today face a world difficult to live in. I've recently been studying a case of protection also, but the people involved are mother and daughter. The mother brought me her daughter's diary. Girl's name is Cornelia. I have a feeling that my mother is cheating on my father. I'm sure of it. Well, I'm not absolutely sure of it, but something's going on. And I just have to find out what it is. Hello? Oh Raul... Yes, I'm alone. Just a minute. I'll make myself a little more comfy. No, that's really very foolish, Raul. Totally foolish. But you can't be serious enough thinking. No, it's impossible. Ask the question. Raul, it'd never work. But naturally, I'm attracted to you. That goes without saying I admit it. But. Well, in principle, you're right. We met a few days ago at Fred's, if I recall. Oh, this weekend? No, it's out of the question. I understand, Raul, but this weekend is really impossible. Well, next weekend, my husband is gone. But where could we meet? That's the problem. Well, first, I have difficulty in even getting away for several hours. I'm married, so I'm not that free. If we went to a hotel here, I might be recognized. I don't know. But maybe if I went to that beauty farm out of town, that could work. You're supposed to be there all the time, but. Oh, I can have the evening off. It's a wonderful solution. I'll have to go to that farm. I know, other farm is strictly forbidden to men. How should I know? Oh, but there's a nice hotel that's nearby. You take a room there. Okay. Next weekend then. Bye. Oh, so that's it. I've got to stop her. But how? Feels good. See you later. Nothing finer than us on it and really get yourself in shape. And it's for a good cause. No man wants a fat wife. But what a hassle to stay trim. That's true. Only if you have a husband anything like mine, he'll be appreciative. The sauna treatment is very successful for you. Yes. I've taken off 48 and a half pounds since I started here. All you need is that special face cream like the stars in Hollywood use. What's so special about it? It's supposed to be the greatest male sperm. It really does wonder stuff. You just rub it all over and let it dry, and then you have no more wrinkles. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, he'll provide it and use it every day. Every day. Albert's strong, but that would kill him. Oh, Doctor, have you any idea how much longer this gluey mask stays on? The treatment will take another half an hour or so. But, Madam, you can take your mask off anytime. I haven't got a mask on Doctor. Oh, Yes. Terribly sorry about that. Oh, it's really quite true. If you undergo a beauty operation here, you will never regret it. Oh, you mean you had an operation? Yes. On my breast. Such a sensation. Yes, indeed. I recommend it very highly. It cost you a lot of money only it's worth every single cent. Yeah, I can see that. It's money well spent. I wonder if this Raul will really come. Maybe something happened. But if it does show up, what then? I really don't know. All I know is that I've got to stop him from meeting Mother. Whatever it takes, no matter what. Raul Hartmann. A good day, Mr. Hartmann. Your room is 34. I'm sure you'll like it with baths and balconies. Oh, that's what's me. You know the beauty farm nearby. Please put through a call for me, would you? Immediately? I'm sorry. Mrs. Kersten is not able to accept a call now. Yes, certainly. Raul Hartmann, Park Hotel, Fine. She'll telephone you when she's free. I'm expecting a phone call. I'll either be in my room or in the bar. Yes, sir. I'd like a room, please. Single or double? Well, single, of course. Yes, naturally, a single room. You do have a room that's free, don't you? Well, yes, we do. Fill in your name and address. Now, then, with the right makeup and the right dress. I know I can look sexier than my mother. Oh, I hope this works. Uh-uh, no bra. Girls looking for action. Never wear bras. Oh, Raul, it's you. Yes, I got your message. I'm getting a massage. Oh, look, I'll phone you later, Raul. Okay? I've had enough for today. Let's stop. Would you try to get that call through? Yes. This is something else. I feel naked. I'm glad it's not cold in here. Well, at least I'm being noticed. That's what I wanted, isn't it? I wonder what Raul looks like. He's probably a sharp dresser. No, it can't be him. He doesn't look like he'd have to go after a married woman. Now. He's a slightly prospect. Just look at him. An adulterer if I ever saw one. Thank you. Haven't I seen you somewhere? You look familiar. I believe it was at a recent party by swimming pool. Albert's? that's right. You wore a bikini that was out of sight. Yes, sir. Albert threw a real party, went to a lot of trouble, and a lot of expense. That's true. But what's a fortune for him in his business. He makes one every day. Why don't we talk about him more at the bar? I'd be delighted. Hello. Well, finally. You know, Edith, it's not easy to reach you there. I called at least ten times. Why did you go on later? Yes, but it's got to be now or never for me. I don't want to wait any longer, that's all. Well don't think I made this trip for nothing. And Besides, you told me you'd come. I never told you anything. Excuse me. Can I have the phone book for a second? Thanks. No, believe me, it's not that at all. Isn't that the reason you're at the beauty farm, Edith? To make yourself beautiful for a man, for me, I'll wait in the bar in the hotel. Not there. We might be seen. That wouldn't be wise. I'll be there around nine. Exactly where? Come to my room. Nobody will see you. The door is unlocked. Room number 34. Right. See you at 09:00. Don't worry about a thing. Bye. Excuse me. Yes, Miss. Mayer, Connie Mayer. Miller. Raul Miller. Raul Miller. And Connie Mayor, makes a good sounding team like Abbott and Costello. Listen, please. This man's waiting in the bar, he was in the lobby and suddenly he asked me if I'd have a drink with him. But I don't want to. And I don't blame you. But I've got a good idea. If you don't want to go with him, how about coming out with me? They have wonderful horses here. We could go for a ride in the country. That sounds nice, but I'm afraid of horses. You see, then we'll get ourselves a drink. Excuse me, please. Could you call me a taxi? Yes. Goodness. Is it really half past 8? Yes. Will you be back for dinner? No. I think I'll have dinner out. Taxi, please. Yeah, this is marvelous scotch Raul Let's have another. No, I'm sorry, Connie, but I better go now. I told you I have to meet somebody. A meeting? Yeah, but she didn't say with whom. All right. If you really want to know it's with a very charming lady. I figured that's what it was... Connie, you've been asking questions all evening. Things young girls shouldn't ask. I just want to know if you're in love with her. Another round sir? No, for God's sake, we can't keep it up. Oh, now don't be like that. Just one more, huh? You can keep your date with your lady friend. I'll answer my question. You love her or don't you? I might.. Love Isn't that simple? So then you don't love her You just want to go to bed with her? All right, Connie, that's enough. I've got to get going. See each other tomorrow. Okay. A few more minutes that's all. Then Connie Goes Beddie Byes, Like a good little girl sure. And you can have your lady. The restaurant. Is it on the second floor? Yes. The elevators around the corner. That's interesting. What kind of a woman do you prefer, then? Oh, I go for the ones better like iceberg. Not much on the surface, but what you find underneath. Don't you ever think of anything else? No. Do you know of anything better? There we are. Where's the hole? I can't find the key hole. Sleep well, please. Raul, put me to bed. Please take off my shoes. Is Mr. Hartmann in the hotel? I'm not sure shall I have him paged Hartmann? Isn't he he guy who's screwing that little broad in room 32. Mother and Father remain as ever, they are totally unaware of the facts. I see. And now what is Cornelia's relationship with her mother? It was because I asked Edith to bring Connie's diary to me. That she finally found out, a rather severe method, but a successful one. I'm happy to say that mother and daughter are now the best of friends. Man, will you take a look over there? How's that for a pair? I'll take the left and you take the right. Okay? It's not possible. Max. You don't just walk up like that. It's very impolite, it's a fine way of getting slapped. Then you have the answer without asking. You always play it like that. Yeah, and you've never been hit by a girl? Friend, are you kidding? Sure. Often. But if she doesn't hit you, it means that she'll be a bed partner. Come on, let's go. The other guys will get them. Maybe you'd better go alone. I just can't. Still can't make it with a bride, huh? No. Have you asked the doctor about it? I've seen them already. That quack says I've got a nervous disorder. That's all he told me. It's not normal to get upset whenever I see a girl in the news. I think he's right. If today's nudies don't turn you on, man, you're out of it. That happens to me all the time. Oh, boy, you're an exception. Hell, I'm crazy over a nude girl. I perform like a real champion. You're pretty lucky. Well, if you don't try, then you'll never know. Look, I'm a friend. Believe me, try it. No, I'd be too afraid. You want to see a master in action? Where? Come to my place tonight. I think I've got it. Little redhead that I've been dating. Yeah, she sure knows how she'd make a man out of any guy. Hey, Lily. How do you make ends meet and still have money left over for extra? It isn't easy. I have a part time job. You got a job on the side, then? Oh, just tutoring a few slow kids in Latin. I get $5 now. $5. We can take 30 for Latin lesson. No, for heaven's sake. Oh, but either that's true. You started. No, don't get that into your head. We make love for pleasure and don't ask for cash. What's this? Eva and I are photographers models, nude models. unbelievable. What a camera bud will pay for services rendered. Yeah, but if a guy gets a good shot and publishes it.. if that could be the case. No, there mostly old men who haven't even a camera or they know how to use it. What if sometimes it's more than pictures and they find they've made a mistake? I heard about a big party tonight. You're coming? No. Max and I have plans for this evening already. Oh, God. Yeah. Tell me if you're really that glossy. Curious, aren't you? Have fun? You do the same. Get off the drill. Drilling a hole in it. You'll ruin it. No holes stands between fine friends. You really insist. I see the whole thing. Yeah, it's the best way to make sure you're cured. After you see my work, my boy. You'll see it's child's play. Hurry. That's Lily. Now, come on, get in. Sounds like she's in a hurry tonight. She's a very sensitive girl. So don't make any noise and disturb her. Dreaming of vacation, Erwin. Dreaming of you, precious only of you. Well, that's true. Tonight. You can try again tonight. That's slavery. And maybe you forget. I got to finish screwing this. Hello, Lily! Come in.. You took long enough to answer the door Make yourself comfy.. You boaring holes in the wall. Oh Max, You remember my cap? It's not in there. It's in here. But the cap can wait and I can't. Don't be in such a hurry. See a woman and you're ready for bed. You're so lovely. Trail and magnificent. Max, you know how much I love you. But you're becoming impossible. Never offering to take me to a bar even. Well, here's the music. The music you'll have right now. And after all the drinks you want, only that will have to wait. I have much better things in mind. What's that? You didn't like pantyhose? I replaced them with the garter belt. What was that? Oh, a sneeze. You didn't sneeze. My neighbor has a cold. He caught it playing football. Pretty wild Ball speed Well, don't worry about it. You should take something for that. It's Hay fever. I'm sorry about yesterday. Look, just forget all about it. Catch my big performance. Yeah, a little of it. Okay, man, you're ready to have at it? Just put yourself in my hands tonight, you can't fail Tonight? Why so soon. Look, you got to strike while the iron is hot as the wise old Prophet clearly stated. And, baby, there goes your iron. No, Max, you have Lily. She's a clean, fine type. I've had it with her. Tell me, will you, Max, explain to me why it is that after many men have finished with the girl, some say they prefer to kick the broad out of bed. You're a boy. I'll make it over on your own. I'm not about to break my back with a load like you. You don't care if I go and get my tiny little feet all wet and frozen. Just because you're not man enough to do your duty. And who warm's the cold tootsies up in bed tonight? Who cares? Oh, why did I ever go and marry you? Pour little bastard is in for a big surprise. Don't worry. No man's ever surprised very long. You're right. Only first he has to be a man. Virgin? Mmm Have you told Babs? I've been trying to all night, but I haven't as yet. Well find time right now. Wait a minute. Let's change partners. Okay, Max, you've inherited me. What's Max doing? Don't dance so close. Want something great? Sure. What you got? How about vodka? Oh, yeah. Just start pouring. What do you think of Sascha? Pretty good looking guy, after looks. What do you think? Charming but unimpressed with me, silly girl. He's just too shy to say anything. No, it's simply that I'm just not his type. But sure you are. He may not look impressed with you, but he told me he is. You mean it? He has one problem. You're going to be his first lay. You mean he's never. Never. He's still a Virgin. Said I had a surprise for you tonight. Well, I never expected that. He gets nervous. So you'll have to be gentle. He tried before and couldn't. So I'm counting on you Bab's. I'll only be gone ten minutes. Gwendolyn, you're off to guzzle a few. Your beers make you bloated and impotent. No, I'm just going to take out the garbage, my dear. You needn't bother? I've already done it. Well, also, I'll probably stop by the Forbes a few minutes and get back the vacuum. You must have forgotten Erwin. I have it. The man brought it back yesterday. It's over there. Where? There. That's it. All right, Gwendolyn, for a wife. You're the what? Sweetest. A little drink eh to get things started. Best way, really? To liven' things up, you know. Hey, I'll pour it out for you. A good brand of Scotch. But I just drink Coca Cola. But Scotch is the thing to drink for a party. Come on, Sascha. Drink up. Sorry, but I never drink liquor. Time for you to start. Then the moment is right for everything. You wouldn't disappoint me? No. Okay, here. Drink scull. Scull? Scull! That means you got to drink it all down. Just go easy, Babs. You're in Virgin territory. Think I'm a pioneer. You're a modern day miracle. Come on, Babs. Get to work, Max. I propose my work. I'm not booked before to a room. Only tonight. It's pretty special for him. Get this thing going and we'll vanish. You know Max about Eva. She's been looking forward to a good time tonight. Look, I'll see that Eva's happy. The problem is Sascha, he'll be just fine. It's only me who'll be left out. You know, virgins have no control. Well, how are you doing, lover? Are you speaking to me? Come on. Come with me, Sascha. I'll be right back. Did she agree, Max? Not too easily. Oh, then I've got you. You know, your bosom is just as big as ever. It's just fallen a few inches. I think she'll get to Sascha Yeah, I'll go turn the record over. Oh, Sascha, please leave it to Max. Max, I wouldn't mind if you found another record. Like my breasts? Yeah, sure. Why don't you touch them then? Kiss me.. It's you. Gwendolyn. I'm sorry. Yeah. Kiss my breasts. Kiss Sascha. Take off my garter belt.. It's not too easy. Now the panties! Max? Yeah? but Max can't help you now. Can't we continue this tomorrow? You make all the other men I've known look like foolish children to me. You're still very gentle with me, Sascha. Yet masculine. Now I know why people say they want to make a Virgin. Why? Why? It's different. Tell me, why haven't you done it before tonight? Well... Max is a friend of mine, but I'm wising up.. Who are my heart? Sunlight. How's business in the post office? Or do you still plan to be a star? Plan? I've five years left to go with the postman, then Siegfried will become a star. I've got a great book that teaches me everything I have to know. Bridgette, if you have a minute or two tonight, I'd love to recite a monologue to you. Ziggy, please. I've already told you, you're not my type at all. Oh, but, Bridget, you are my waking dream of the Fallen night. My shining starlet That's really foolish of you. I mean, look around. There's many other pretty girls you could get. Why me? Well, it's destiny. Hey, stop talking to my daughter. See, I've forbidden you, too. We'll go to a lovely land far away where lemons grow. There's your lemon tree for you. Now get your ass going. Delivery time. That little guy is really funny. Well, Ziggy, are you hurt, Ziggy? Say something. Quote from Blishen verse three. Who the hell is he? Head postmaster. How he does it, but he finds time to do all the cooking here in the kitchen. A Jack of all day. Hope you youngsters. Enjoy today's specialty. Funny looking. What is it? Suckling pig and soy sauce. Fresh from the mother's breasts. Well, that's great. I love sucking breasts myself. How about you? Especially if they're Roxy's. What about her? Two beers, please? Sure. Two beers. If he ever knew? Today. I hope it works. We can't miss today. I got everything set. Hello, Father. You're home already. Roxy, what's new at school? Oh, nothing at all. I'll serve the beer. I like. Helping out a little. Hi, Roxy. Are you going to make it okay? I don't know. But, Roxy, I've got two days left. Then I'm going to have to leave the hotel. I know, but no, but just come to my room. It's simple. Oh, sure, it's simple. Only if father found out he'd kill us. Do you know how to handle things? No, it's too risky. Come over to the barn about three. Will you bring Bridget? Yeah, she'll be with me. It's all set. See? Separate all the mail later. Better do the packages first. There's one other thing that's the last time I want to tell you. Leave my daughter alone! Oh.. Mr. Wimmer I only want to share my new versus with her. I know what you want to share with her. If I catch you again, you got my promise. I'll break you in two and I'll throw away the pieces. Virtue will defend itself against The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Oh, boy, you mixed up. It doesn't go like that. Hamlet never defended virtue. The man hated it. If he did, why kill poor Desdemona? That's why Shakespeare could never wash off the blood, see. I have a feeling Shakespeare just rolled over famous men. A long suffering soul. And if the mail isn't done, you'll be the long suffering soul. We have a date with Fred and George at the barn. Afterwards, Where do we go? Freeze to death, there. I have to find a warmer place. The burgharper shed has plenty of hay. The place is well heated. Wonderful. We'll go there. But the burgharper shed is about an hour from here. Yeah, on foot. But if we were to say, borrow your father's car. Yeah, it's a great idea. He won't miss it until after his card game tonight. Here's the keys. But wait a minute. I got the car and can't drive. I can't either. But the boys can. Can you drive a car? Not really. Well, let me try. What have you gone and done? End of the line. Stop. You spying on me you stupid idiot. It's surely fate that sent me out to this land to listen to the Oracles. That's not bad. Well, as long as you're here, I'll recite the rest of it for you. You better hide, Ziggy. My father's coming. Oh, my God. He'll kill me. Yeah, you could say that again. Especially when he finds out you busted his car. You busted up the car. It's not my fault. Who's is it, then? Ya know, I think something's wrong with you. What's the matter? Well, for an hour you've been sitting there staring at the idiot box and there's no program. You worry, eventually it'll come on. What happened to Bridget? Over at Roxy's studying? Bridget's a good girl. Did you close up downstairs in the post office? Yeah, but I'm worried about Siegfried. Silly fool isn't in yet. No worries. Ziggy will come in. Yeah, he's a real bonehead today. He confused Shakespeare with Faulkner. Well, now I got to go. Boys will be waiting. Coming home for dinner? No, it's Friday night, remember? Why don't you get too drunk? You know, I never get drunk. Sit and watch your program. And don't bother waiting up for me. Come on, hurry up. We'll all get stiff with cold. I've got a little something that's already stiff. We'll see what we can do about that. Oh, come on. Don't make with the funnies. Open it and get it over with. Get Brieftrager out. Nothing is going to be planned. There's no place else for us to go now. Only I have to admit it's kind of funny. Damn it. I'm going to come to your room. Where you're going to come to mine? That's impossible, George. My father'd be sure to hear us. Look, my place is out. The big barn is no good. The shed we can't get to in your rooms out because of your dumb old man. Have you forgotten my place? Bridget, you got to be kidding. I can open up a poster. Hello? Get me out of here will you. Please get me out. Shit. We'll never open this thing. Got to get a wrench. No, you'll hurt the car. Find the locksmith. No phone at my house. I can call and I'll arrange things at the post office. 07:00. Meet me at the back door. Okay, right. It's your turn. Come on. You gonna play or aren't you? Ah, you're finally home. You studied a long time. Did you learn a lot? Oh, I learned a little. Only not nearly enough. Is there anything wrong, Roxy? Oh, nothing I can't take care of with hard work. And tonight I think I should go back to Bridget's to study more. What? Tonight? You're going back with a restaurant as full as it is. Oh, Father, you've always insisted that I have a good education. And that takes a lot of studying. Things have changed, all right? Never had to study that hard when we were growing up. Well, as far as Bridget goes, she better study. I'm paying an eye on a tooth for that girl, and she doesn't even bother to say thank you. How's your boy coming along? He's in prison. Mother, I'm sorry, but it's impossible for us to study here. We'll go down to the post office. The post office? Yes, but be careful that you don't disturb anything. No, don't worry about a thing, mother. I don't understand it. That great. Gary Cooper film is supposed to be showing right now. This magazine I bought says the Channel Two is showing that film. You've forgotten that today all programs have been cancelled. Why have they been cancelled? Energy crisis. He must be freezing in there. I feel sorry for the poor guy. What made him get in the trunk in the first place? Oh, look, maybe we should force let the locksmith do it. Yeah, we've got other things to do right now. Okay, come on in. But keep quiet. What a dream. That was my lovely Bridget and I. We are such stuff as dreams are made on. It was worth the wait. Nice. Ready to enjoy it? Cramped in here isn't it? It'll do. I don't think you'll ever learn to play poker, but let's have another bear. You know, I don't drink beer. We'll have another beer and he'll have another Coke, leaving with all you want. No, I'll be right back just after I water a tree outside. Why can't he use a toilet? Other men do. Animal. Let me cut him. Bridget, is that you? Light of my life or dream of my night? You hear me? Do you hear the plenty of voice in the wilderness? That bastard is in my car. He's got a meeting planned with Bridget. Well, he'll meet someone, all right? Someone who's going to beat him to death. Oh, thank you. Wimmer. A wonderful star fill winter evening, isn't it, you little weasel, you filthy Vermin. You come out you had some plans, but Bridget's been replaced tonight Siegfried. Her father's here trying to screw me. Why? Bridget's an innocent flower, and I want to see that she stays that way. Oh, but Mr. Wimmer Who's the imbecile knocking on the door. Vimer, are you in there? I bought the tube. Damn. He's going to wake up everybody in the house, and your mom thinks we're studying. So you'll have to open it. Wimmer, where are you? What's going on? I've got to see Wimmer. Where's Wimmer? I brought this tube over to mail! At this hour of the night? Come back in the morning. It has to be in the mail tomorrow. Very well. All right. I'll come down for it. Thank you. Mother. I'll open up. You don't have to bother to do it. Thank you, dear. The man is being very insistent. Don't worry. I'll take care. Can't stay out here all night. Come around to the window. Yes. Is your father in there? No. I brought this tube to mail. Are you feverish? Yeah, it goes up and down every hour. Really? Have you taken some medicine? Yes, I have only have to do it again. I've got my ramrod in here sending it to be repaired. I already have one. That's working. What? I mean, nobody needs a second one. Your father said he'd mail my ramrod. He's at the restaurant, isn't he? Wait, I'll take it. You can pay my father later. Good. I'm very grateful to you. The pleasure is mine. I won't forget to send it. Good night. Bridget's refusing to get up again. Well, she studied awfully late last night. Fine student. I'm her mother. I know she is, but she can't sleep her life away. Okay, quit your bitching. I'll go get Bridget out of bed. Bridget on your feet this side up. Fragile special delivery. Return to sender. You little rat. I'm going to kill you. What have you done to my daughter? Answer me will ya? Nothing, I was just dreaming of her. You left your trademark all over her. Wait a second. Get out of here. I Quit! Master. Here is blood in offering to your Almighty power. Satan, accept our sacrifice. Blood for blood. Blood with the body, body with the blood. Offer yourselves to the master. Give thanks to Satan. You got me another girl who wasn't a Virgin. Yeah.. What of it? You know our rules and blissfully state. We have to sacrifice only virgins. Look, your black mass rules are one thing. But finding virgins today is another thing. What do I pay you for then? Because I let you rape young girls in my cellar every weekend. That's a big risk I take. My cheque is big too. Look, friend, from now on I only want The Real McCoy You had 'em in the past didn't ya? Rarely. Stop laughing. You're paid for fine merchandise. And before you get another cheque you got to come up with a Virgin. There won't be another mass for three weeks. And it's very important. And I want a Virgin for it. You'll have her. But I told you it's difficult. I warn you, friend. Don't try to cross us. What do you think I am, huh? A little hood. Oh, you took pictures of my last master. So what? Within my own cellar. I'm free to do anything. The film. Is that okay, Franz? Yeah. Now try to smile. Got it, girl. Hold it. Sure. And you sold them the whole role just mine. You could have gotten a bundle of money out of those shots. Okay, Elfi, you can get dressed now. I've had it for today. What's wrong with you, Franz? Something bothering you. I got to find a Virgin. A Virgin? Immediate. Chosen for? No, not for me. For the next black mass in my cellar. Virgins for the mass. And I don't know any virgins in town. I thought maybe you knew one. It's difficult. You know, the pill is common. Now, you might find one among the schools. I don't care what she is, but she better be a cherry. Friend of mine might know one. And she still goes to school. You're a sweetheart. Just be sure to get me one. Try Rosie Marek. She's got to be married for sure. Her father makes awfully sure of it. You might ask. I'm going to. I hear you got a fiance? Yes. That's strange. I just sworn you were a Virgin. But it's true. I am, Mario's Sicilian. Which means don't touch her. Got it custom that makes us wait until our wedding night. Then you've never done anything? No, not yet. But if you said you wanted to, it makes no difference. But if he thinks I'm going to wait much longer, he's mistaken. If I were you, I'd call my engagement off. It's unofficial because of my dad. Pay attention. You've got spaghetti all over it again. What do you got against me, senior Marek? Simply that you're stupid. You think I'm a stupid? My momma say I'm wisest boy of all her children. Oh, my God. I hope in that case, I never meet the others. At the fabulous wedding of Rosie and me. You're going to meet them? There's spaghetti in your head instead of brains. I will never consent to let Rosie marry a foreigner. Which I'm your common market brother, remember? All right, forget about that. But I won't give her to some rock head. Oh, Amore is far more important. Amore, Amore. Try living off your Amore. And another thing. Don't call her my Rosie anymore. She's mine. And I plan to keep her until I'm ready to let her go. Actually, I played it careful and never mentioned details. You don't want her scared. You talk too much, will she or won't she do it? Well, I'm pretty sure but, why the hesitation? It's maybe going to take a little money on the side to convince her all the money she wants. It'll go a whole lot easier if you pay her to do it. The guy I work for is loaded. It seems a little riskier. Rosie's so terribly young. Well, the younger the better. This is the last time I work as his pimp. The money's not worth it. Have different plans. I'm heading down to Rome. Just work as a photographer and try to forget this shit. What do I do? Come along with me? Not just yet, Franz. Make it later. The Port was all a referee. No, that wasn't a low blowy, deck. You are the feeling I was the one he k.o'd. Blow that level. You was a left cross to the rib section That's a damn lie. You're not in some ring. You're lucky, Ivan. Look, if you got a fight, let me put one together for you. Yeah, it sounds fair enough. It'd be a good match. But now talk about the black mass. Yes, I have good news for you. About our mass. My friends. It's all been arranged according to rule. I almost decided to give up hope. I have the man's word. This arrangement, however, is very costly. Look, I'll pay anything. If you let me make the main sacrifice, we all have to pay. But the initiation is made by the master. I still offer to fork over extra. Only you got to promise I can have second place. Let's hope she's a Virgin and that bastard don't foul us up again. He won't have the chance. This time I plan to make sure of the girl. It's the beauty sitting in the corner. She's with some Italian. Go take a look? Seems she's okay. You won't find anything nicer. Believe you, me. I said seams and I'll find out soon enough when she's laid on the table. One look at her is enough to convince anyone she hasn't. If you can't go by appearances. Hey, wait a second. Where's the money? Your money comes after? I find out the merchandise is as pure as all of your promises. You don't want to pay, do you? Then why don't you go to Marrakesh, get them by the dozen over there? What are you insinuating? Except that this girl is not stupid. She's asking you for a little money to make the scene for you guys. You don't think she's doing it for a kick? How much? Well, 500 for the chick and five for me. Here's the five to pay her and the other five. Your money comes on delivery next Sunday. Look, if you've got it right, just tell me later. I'm paid in advance too. If you cross me, friend, I'm going to see that you don't work again. Ever. Hey, big man, if you think you can, you've got a lot to learn. I put a little letter away a long time ago with all the details. We have to leave now, Mario. Oh, no, there's no reason why they should come along. Look, if they don't want to come and forget it, I got to get you home to your father. Oh, but really, it's not even six yet. Mario says Rosie. She arrived home at six. If she has a home at six, he's going to give me trouble. Tell me Mario, must they always follow us around. Sure, they are my friends. I know, but they don't leave us alone a minute. You're in Germany, not Sicily! Mario, I'm beginning to believe you're not a man. I am a man. A strong man. I want to have an adventure. Something extraordinary. You're packing already? Yes. We're leaving right after delivery. Not before he hands over the cash. That goes without saying. Is everything set? Everything's in place just like you said. Good. And how about the broad? She sounds very excited over the thought of the black mask. But I'm worried, you can buy everything with money. I didn't have to offer anything. You didn't? If I mentioned, I don't think she would have taken it. You mean you have the cash? Right here. Stupid kids.. After what she calls a big adventure. Sure picked a big enough one for a beginner. Father, What time is it? Going on four. Why? Oh, I'm going to have to go. Where? Church? Four seems late in the day. To me, the priest is giving a special mess. I have to go. Oh, well, something else. You go whenever you want. I don't mind. Ciao. Here she come's. Anytime you're ready. We're all set to roll. Look, Elsie, I really don't know. I thought a lot about it now. Oh, you can't back out now kid. Come on. Why do I have to be completely nude? I don't think I like that. Don't worry. All the others are already in dress Rosie. Nobody at a sex party wears clothes They only get in the way I'm very pleased. She's beautiful and just a child. You won't find better. A real Virgin at last Satan will be satisfied. Yeah. Now hand over my money. I've delivered your Virgin. Hey, look, there's someone... Just lie down on the center. No, you hurt me, child. Oh, father makes mask's for horror shows This doesn't scare me Hush! The Almighty must be respected by all within these walls. Satan has no sense of humor. No, No! Elfi, EIfi help me? What did you do with my Rosie? Get your dirty hands off, will ya? That's better, in the cellar. Look for yourself. You'll find a bunch of real nice guys who think it's about the time she became a woman. You louse.. Hearing no objections or reasons for not uniting you in a lawful and Holy state of wedlock. If you agree, say yes. Mario Messina. Do you take Rosalind Marek here present as your lawful wife? For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health till death do you part? Yes. Rosalind Marek. Do you take Mario Messina here present as your lawful husband? For better or for worse, promising to love, honor and obey till death do you part? Yes. Then by the powers invested in me as justice of the peace, I declare you before God and by law to be husband and wife. What God has joined together let no man put asunder..
