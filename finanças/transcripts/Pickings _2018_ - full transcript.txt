" Isoru Yamamoto. Listen to me, madam. You did not know, Do not know who is dealing with. You bitch. You will pay for What are you doing. Do you hear me? Bastard. Are you panic? Are you scared? Screw you. Get me out of here. Let me go. You've heard Tony Robbins? Yes, if you have interest towards human psychology, You have to listen Tony Robbins. Honestly, I used to think that was boasting, Until one day I found out the tape at the gas station in Missouri. This was in the 80s where people were still have a cassette player in his car, But what tapes say which makes people act, The things they do. That is news from human psychology, And that brings you my face tonight. Every decision you make in your sad life, Has been moved by one of two basic human instincts, Pain and pleasure. You know, Tony said if we were as a human, Do what we want to do ... ... according to our desire to get pleasure ... Or our need for avoid pain. You stole because of you afraid of something, Payment of debt due date, Or feel hungry without food available at the table, Or you steal because of you like the tension. You enjoy stealing something. You killed people because you like to kill people ... ... or because you were ordered to do it ... ... and you're too scared to say no ... ... to people who give you orders. This is a fact that doesn't indisputable. Either you act because fear... ... or because you seek pleasure. That's a human thing. There is no other way for that. And that brings me to the point. You, we, are in a situation this terrible. You say if I don't know who you are That is not entirely true. Because as already we conclude, You are only one of two things. Between you coward or devil. Bundak or dissident. Lion or village cat. What am i make you understand? Take care of yourself. How about that? You broke my nose. Did you see that? This is who you really are. Trying to convince me otherwise it's very rude. I think I see village cat. Screw you! Let me go! Swear to God ... I will kill your family! Jimmy, my friend. This is a pleasure for me. You've dealt with queen of devils! For most people, Feeling the pain as if irresistible death. Suffering related with physical, Psychology, or even spiritual suffering, Strong enough to lead a sane person heading to the threshold of sanity ... ... and throw it away into the abyss. Those people are most people, And most people try to spend their entire lives ... ... to seek comfort, As far as possible from pain that can be felt by humans, But a few steps use pain with impunity ... ... to get those who afraid to do the order. For them, pain tend to end, A tool in a box crazy tools.
