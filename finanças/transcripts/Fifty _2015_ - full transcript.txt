Okay, starting with part one, Monte Dupearl, part side one. Starting the bid at one thousand dollars, do I have one thousand dollars? Thank you, I have one thousand. Do I have fifteen hundred? Fifteen hundred. Two thousand? Two thousand at the back of the room, thank you mum, you're beautiful. Twenty five hundred. Three thousand here at the back, sir. Any advance on three thousand? Three thousand five hundred, lady in the red dress. Thank you very much, mum. Any more bidders, three thousand five hundred, last time. Sold. Thank you very much, mum, may I see your card, please? That's card 220. Thank you very much. - [Voiceover] Hello, and welcome to the show. Today we are discussing the folly topic of wedding women, and what do we see? (Muffled radio) - Kichi, why is the table set for two? - Ma, I thought that your friend Sal was going to spend the night. - Unless I told you so, never assume that my guest is staying the night. - Yes, ma. I'm sorry, ma. Happy birthday, ma. - Oh! Thank you! This is very nice of you. - You're welcome, ma. What about the party? - What party? - Last year, you said you were going to three big parties to celebrate a birthday this year. - I did? Hm. I wonder what made me say that. - You work too hard, ma. - Nonsense, Kichi. In my line of business, there's no such thing as working too hard. (Phone rings) - Elizabeth, don't tell me you're going to remind me again about your talk. Because if you have, (speaking Nigerian) - No, Maria, that is not why I'm calling you this morning. I just called to wish you a happy birthday, my dear. ♪ Happy birthday to you, ♪ ♪ happy birthday to you, ♪ ♪ happy birthday dear Maria, ♪ ♪ happy birthday to you. ♪ - Thanks, Lizzy. - A-huh. Happy twentieth anniversary of your thirtieth birthday, darling. Mm-hm. Let's paint the town red tonight. I have just the place in mind. - Ooh, I can't wait. - Doctor Famakuwa? - Hold on a second, though. Yes? - We're ready for you. - Okay, which way are we going? - This way. - Ah, fine. I have to go. - Okay, sweetie. Break your leg, okay? I'll be watching you. - When we go, I'll set it all up and you make sure you wear something sexy. - [Voiceover] We'll be right back after this message. Stay fabulous. - What is this? This dress is ugly. These shoes, they look so cheap. I want brand news. My show is called "Rich and Fabulous Tola". I want items that scream class, style, glamour. Does that coconut brain of yours know what those words even mean? How many times must I say it? Money's not my problem, but how to spend it. So buy me nice things! I want beautiful things! Has anybody heard from Kate? Why do I even bother talking to you people? I have to do everything myself. Phone! (Phone rings) - Hello? - Where is Kate? Why is she not picking up her phone? How am I supposed to shoot the scene where I talk with my party planner about my fiftieth birthday party without my party planner? - She's on her way, Tola. She left over thirty minutes ago. I'm sure it's the traffic. - Oh, whatever. Just a bunch of incompetent fools. - What time did you get in last night? - I was at a night vigil. - Night vigil, api? And now you're late for your meeting with Tola. When are you going to get your priorities right? - My priorities are right. God is first. - Look, Chekay, I'm not ready for your nonsense this morning. What? - All this "church, church, every day" must stop. - What are you doing here? What happened to the job interview? - I cancelled it. - You did what? - You know me, Kate. I'm not the nine-to-five type. I function best when I'm my own boss. - You need to get a job. - Pot, kettle, black. - Don't "pot, kettle, black" me. I'm not the unemployed one. I got the contract to plan Tola's party just to see us through the next two months. - I'm self-employed, not unemployed. Self-employed. - What difference does it make if you're not putting bread on the table? Tola only wants me at her house early because of that silly reality tv show she is filming. I don't want to be in a reality show! - Kate, Kate, listen. A public appearance will do you no harm. It's free publicity for your business. - My business was fine until you started being reckless with my money. - Your money? Just get out of bed. And for the record, Kate, our money problems are just as much your fault as they are mine. - How many of your "get-rich-quick" schemes have to fail before you wake up, Chekay? How many? - High-risk business investments reap good rewards. That's why they are called high-risk! - And where are these rewards? Where? All I have is stress, worry-- - The stress from all the hours you spend in church, with your fasting and endless prayer meetings! - We need God to save this family. Chekay, I do not want to argue with you. We need to work together. Not against each other! - All you do is spend our money on prayer for this, and prayer for that. - Better spending the money on God's blessings, rather than wasting it on your grandiose "let's-get-rich-quick" schemes! And for the record, it'll be your money when you start making some! - Thank you, my wife. That was what I was waiting to hear! I hope you have a good day. (Applause) - Thank you very much, distinguished ladies and gentlemen. Now, today, I would like to start by telling you about my late mother. She was a great nurse, one who absolutely loved to help people. Now, when your mother loves her work, you are inspired from a very early age to take up that profession. Now, I was named after the late, great Doctor Elizabeth Abimbola Awoliyi. She was my mother's hero. She was West Africa's first female medical doctor, a renowned gynecologist. Now, I knew what I wanted to do with my life from a very tender age. I wanted to help save lives. I was completely obsessed with that born between a mother and her child. Indeed, - (violent heaving) - Why don't you call in sick, Ma? - I am not sick. - This one looks like morning sickness to me. - Can you just tell the driver to get ready? I'm late for work. - Yes, ma. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin mother and child ♪ - If you don't stop singing that song, I'll come up there and strangle you! - Thank you very much. (Applause) Aw, how sweet. Thank you so much for coming. Enjoy the book. Hello! How sweet! What is your name? - Kechay. But it's for my mom, her name is Nena. - Right. Ne-na. How old are you, Kechay? - Twenty-three in December, ma. - That's almost ten months away, why don't you just say you're twenty-two? - I can't wait to be twenty-three. - Can't you now. (Laughs) - Step back from madame. Hold back. (Phone rings) (phone buzzes) - Father, I receive healing from you in the mighty name of Jesus. The mighty name of Jesus. Tola? - What kind of party planner are you? Your behavior is just totally unacceptable. Highly unprofessional! Don't interrupt me. - I'm not interrupting you. - I said, don't interrupt me! Look, if you're not here in the next thirty minutes, you're fired and I might as well tell you now that I will not be recommending your services to anyone, any time soon. Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. - Mrs. Zia, I think we should still wait until Kate gets here. You know, get some reaction shots. - Excuse you, madam producer, but if I want your opinion I'll ask for it. - What she's actually trying to say is that if she wants your opinion, she will tell you what to say. Sis? - Yes, Jamal? - I think you need to listen to your producer. The blogs, they're calling you neurotic. A drama queen. - Really, Jamal, I wonder what they say about you? That's what I thought. Nothing. - If you don't take that camera out of my way, I will have you escorted off my premises and you be fired. Jamal, Jamal. My dear, sweet little brother. But, if I may recall, your presence isn't required on this set today, or tomorrow, or the day after. In fact, your presence isn't required here at all. Not on RFT. So with that, I bid you welcome. And goodbye. - If I may interrupt-- - You may not. - If we include your brother-- - You may not interrupt. My family is off-limits. - (Speaking Nigerian) - Oh, yeah, (speaking Nigerian) Excuse me. Wakey, wakey. A-huh. Let's do this. - Stand by, everyone. - All right, all right, all right, enough, enough. Enough! - And action. - Welcome to yet another fun and glamour-filled day with RFT. In today's episode, we're going to be discussing the preparations for an upcoming event: the celebration of a milestone in my life. Yes, people, I'm going to be hitting the big five-oh, and with you viewers, I'm going to be marking it with style and pizzazz. And that's what this-- pizzazz. I don't think I like that word. It's too akada. Shadi? Change it. (Dramatic music) (muffled shouting) (violent heaving) (retching) (phone buzzes) - Hey. Shadi? - I've told you to stop calling me. - Honey-- - If you call me one more time, I'm going to change my number. - Are you okay? Who was that? (Sad music) - Doctor Famakuma's clinic, Kamos. - Yes, ma. - So I'm thinking, we fill the pool with balloons and lights. - Hmm. Lovely. - Put patty packs all around the pool edge, and then a firework display. - Brilliant! I'm so happy that I chose you to plan my party. Everything sounds perfect. - Cut. Take five, everyone. - Four hours late, Kate. (Speaking Nigerian) Asha-kasha. I ought to just cancel your contract now-now. - I said I was sorry. - Don't interrupt me. - It won't happen again. - I said, don't interrupt me. - O-kay. Turn of a, and three, two. - So I booked the chopper, and the venue is secured. And, - Cut. - Are you okay? Do you need a break? - Please. - Why are you holding your breasts, Lizzy? - Oh. I had to go down to the back-street coop. I booked an appointment. One of Harvey Street's best. - Lizzie. - I am giving these beauties some TLC. What do you think? - I think your breasts are fine the way they are. - I've always wanted a D-cup. A D-cup! Mon cher, let's face it, these beautiful hills are going to head southwards, whether we like it or not. And I believe that we owe ourselves a duty to stop them. - Lizzy, how long are we going to spend talking about the size of your breasts? - Ah, (speaking Nigerian) Your test results have only just arrived from the lab this minute. This exam must get results without pass or fail. - And? - Hm. And you, my lady, you've passed with flying colors. - Meaning? - Right. Now, there's good news and good news. Which one do you want first? - See-- - Ah, chill. How is it? The good news is that the fetus is in utero. - Can you talk to me in plain English? - The other good news is that you are approaching the end of your first trimester. - That's not possible. Trust me, Maria. Not only are you preggers, you're nearly three months gone. - That isn't possible, Lizzy. I'm fifty. - Clearly, you're still ovulating. And you're certainly fertile. Plus, someone with a nice mating call and a healthy sperm-count has been servicing you, you naughty, naughty girl. Abracadabra, (speaking Nigerian) Ha! And you didn't even tell me that you were getting some. And there I was, thinking I'd put some meals in your mouth. (Speaking Nigerian), Maria. Don't get me wrong-- - Oh, Lizzie. Can you help me get rid of the damn thing? This late in the game? At your age? No, milady. I'm going to have to strongly advise against that line of action. (Speaking Nigerian) - I've never wanted children, never. - Why not? Kids are good for you. They grow up to be fascinating adults. - Who refuse to speak to their parents. - That was low. - I really shouldn't have said that, I'm very sorry. Have you spoken to her recently? - She won't speak to me. Not since it happened. - (Speaking Nigerian) - (speaking Nigerian) - Anyway. It's just, have you seen that yeye reality show with that hysterical primadonna? - RFT? Yeah. She's still producing it. - And that "yeyeshua", as you so casually refer to it, is being watched by millions across the continent. - Your point being? - Tola can be a primadonna, yeah. But she's not stupid. - You would say that, wouldn't you. You get on with her like a house on fire. - She's a dear friend, yes. But that's not why I jump to her defense. She has a heart of gold. Do you know how much money that show raked in in advertiser revenue last season? - A lot of money. - A fortune. And we're talking dollars. - Do you know what she did with it? - Gave it to charity. - All of it. And she's done that ever since the show began. - Doesn't make her any less irritating. - (Speaking Nigerian) - Welcome to another fun and fabulous-filled episode with RFT-- ugh. What a load of horse shit. - Hey. You really don't like her, do you? - Mm-mm. - Anyway, that's aside. Here. Just me. Who's the father? - Mm. - Ah. (Speaking Nigerian) You won't tell me. Maria. You'll be back. (Laughs) (roulette wheel spinning) (phone rings) - Hello? - Chekay. It's me, Tola. What on earth is wrong with your wife? I've never seen her this erratic. - I wish I knew, Tola. She must be suffering from some severe form of sleep deprivation. - What do you mean? - She's been coming home from work at odd hours. She came home at five this morning claiming that she spent the night in church. - Really. (Roulette wheel spinning) - Are you okay? - I've been trying to call you. What sort of advice have you been giving my husband? He's lost all our money on another deal again. Let us just say that I warned him not to invest in that stake. I warn all my clients if a business opportunity sounds too good to be true, and it usually is! - But you could have called me. - You're my friend, Kate, but so is Chekay. And he wouldn't take too kindly if he hears that I've been running to you to report on him. If you want to discuss it further, why don't you both just come to the office? And don't look so worried. I'll always-- - Of all the people in the world, Kunle. Of all the people in the world! - I have no idea what you're muttering, my dear, darling wife, but whatever it is, I wish you the same. - How dare you call me your wife. Where have you been since last night? Oh, are you going to deny the fact that you only decided to come home because your mistress is here? Where do you think you're going, Kate? Don't you dare play dumb with me. How could I have been so stupid? He's the reason why you were late today. - You've completely lost your mind. Don't listen to her lies too much. Me? I'm going back to the office. - I am not going to allow you to continue disrespecting me in this house, Kunle. You were having an affair right under my nose, and I didn't suspect a thing. I knew you were spreading your seed all over Lagos. But what I didn't know was that my party planner was one of them! - What you're saying is complete rubbish, and somewhere in that paranoid mind of yours, you know it's rubbish, but you say it so well. - I stretch out my hand to you in friendship, and you spit into it. - Come on. - I let you into my house. I pay you good money. And this is how you choose to repay me? So be it. You're fired. - What just happened, please? - I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I don't know what's going on-- - Are you still here? Get out of my house, you shameless prostitute! - Tola! - Out! - Tola! - Oh, Jesus. (Solemn music) - Good night, ma. - Good night, Columbus. - Madam, are you okay? - Did I say I wasn't? - Sorry, ma. - Kichi. - Ma? - Thanks for the birthday card. - You're welcome, ma. - Get a glass. Have some wine. - Ah, no thank you, ma. I'm fine. - All right. Good night, then. - Good night, ma. - Mm. Oh, babe. You're getting that so... mm. Where'd you learn how to do that, darling? You should be a chiropractor. - Really? Or do you want a more thorough examination? - Mm. My friend just found out that she's pregnant. - And? - She's fifty. - IVF? - Mm-mm. Not IVF. And the thing is, she doesn't even want it. And the irony is that I make my living by helping women who are desperate to have children. Life is full of paradoxes. (Phone buzzes) - Oh, wait. You're not getting it. - I'll be back. I'll be back, I promise. Hello? Baby, are you okay? - Are you home? - Uh, yeah. Where are you? I'm at the front door. Can you open up for me, please? - Of, of course, darling. This is Doctor Elizabeth, from Akiwa. Please leave a message after the -- (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) Okay. - Good evening. - Hello, darling, Shadi. Did you miss your keys? - You sounded awake on the phone, just minutes ago. - I did? (Sniff) Air freshener. - I just came to pick up some stuff from my room. Is that okay? - That's fine, darling, but before you do that, sit. Let's talk. We haven't done that in a while. - You've got company. - Maria. Maria came to see me a while ago, it was some great news. Aren't you going to ask me what the news is? She just found out that she's pregnant. Can you believe that? - Why do I think you're lying? - Don't be cheeky, young lady, you can ask her yourself. - I thought she hated children. - What gave you that idea? - She says so, all the time. - Right. How is RFT doing? You must be proud of that show. - It's okay. It pays the bills. - Are you still sharing that flat in Ikeja? Shadi, your hair is so beautiful. Is this what's in at the moment? - I don't know. - Shadi, um-- - Hi. - Shadi. Shadi, Shadi. Shadi. Honey! Shadi, wait. Come on, darling. - It's okay, it's nothing. It's nothing I haven't seen before. At least this time, it's not my boyfriend. - I was tipsy that night. - My boyfriend, mom. My boyfriend. - So what do you want me to do, go down on my knees and beg? - No. If I never saw you kneeling again, that wouldn't be too soon. That was the position I found you in when I walked in on you, remember? (Slap) - You will respect me, young lady. I am your mother. - Some mother. - And don't you ever come back here, you hear me? - And don't you ever phone me again. - I told you to go into my bedroom, Sammy, not her room. - But you, but you put me in-- - No I didn't! - You did, Lizzy. - Are you calling me a liar? - No, I'm not, but you put me in that room. - Okay, fine, so I put you in that room. But I thought it was my room, not hers! - You're scared of your daughter. - No I am not. I just didn't expect her to show up on my doorstep, just like that! - She scared the living daylight out of you. - Oh, shut up, will you? - Are we still going out tonight? - You sound completely drunk. - Is that against the law? - Get dressed. We're going out. - Sammy? Coming up. - Yeah, a minute. (Dance music) - No more drinking. It's not good for the baby. - Who says I'm having a baby? - Hold this for me. I won't be a second. - Okay. - Give me that. - There's something I've always wanted to ask you. How come you never look me in the eyes? - My breasts don't have eyes. - I hear you're pregnant, but you don't want to keep it. No, wait. It's just that, Lizzy told me that she wouldn't help you. - And you will? - Me? Listen. I know some doctors in the area. They have an operation room and everything. I can send you that info, right now. Give me your number. Or better still, I can take you there tomorrow. Lizzy doesn't have to know. - I'm sorry, Michael. I don't do little boys. - My name is Samuel. - I don't care what your name is. I still don't do little boys. - Do you think I was going to toss you? I was only trying to help, I swear. - Come to think of it, though. I wouldn't mind having some of, you know? - Hey baby. Hey sugarbuns. - Mm. - Lizzy. - Huh? - Your smiley was trying to chat me up. - He was? - No. She took it the wrong way. - Now I'm going to have to spank you when we get home. - But you spank me so hard! I don't want you to spank me, I want to be taking your, you know? - You want some of that? - Nah, I'm good. - See you in a bit. - I don't know what you see in that little thing. - He's hung like a horse. Cheers. - Penny for your thoughts? - Go away, Jamal. Leave me alone. - You seem to forget that I live here too, right? I hear her divaness has given herself to terminate Kate. Kate of all people? - That's none of your business. - Why so unhappy, sister? - Why aren't you? - Flick has a performance at Freedom Park tonight. I'm going. I'll come home early. - I'm not going anywhere with you. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - Good night, ma. - Okay, okay, okay. I've got you, take it easy. - Oh! Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

In the name of the father. Yes. Yes, praise. - Hello, Kate. - Pastor. My life is falling apart. You said it would get better, but it's falling apart. - Have you studied your treatment? It says here that you need to-- - The doctor is wrong. I'm convinced that he is wrong. I have faith that this thing will pass. - Hmm. The ways of God are full of mystery, Kate. - I took heart. I come to church. Why is God unhappy with me? Why has he cursed me with this disease, pastor? - You can't look at things that way. - I need to know what I have done wrong. I do not have cancer. There must be a prayer that you can say. - Now you start your treatment. - What can a doctor do that God cannot? Please. Help me, pastor. Help me talk to God. Help me beg him now. - Kate. Have you told your husband? - I've been very busy. - Talk to him. He needs to know. You need all the support that you can get. We here at the church would always be there for you, but you need to talk to your husband, too. - I lost my job today. - Oh dear. - Pastor, please. Pray for me. This is not the right time for me to tell him. What I really need is prayers. - Okay. Do me a favor. I want you to do this first thing tomorrow morning. Go to another hospital. Do a test. Get a second opinion. And if it's true, well, that letter says that you may need vasectomy to save your life. So be it. Accept it as the will of God. (Phone buzzing) - Tola. Hello. - Good morning, Kate. I hope I didn't wake you up. - Wake me? I'm just on my way home. I was in church all night. - That's what I thought. Listen, Kate? I'm really sorry about what happened yesterday. I was wrong. I was totally out of order. My husband and I have our problems, and you've got nothing to do with them. I shouldn't have made those accusations I made. I apologise, and I hope you can forgive me. You're back on as my party planner, if you're still interested. I hope you are. - Chekay. You're still up. - Where have you been all night? - Night vigil. I sent you a message. - Mm. In that dress? What kind of night vigil with that? - You know very well that I went straight from shoot. I could not come home to change because of the traffic. Chekay, please don't be angry. I'm sorry. - I'm not angry, Kate. I just don't get this thing you're doing. - It's prayers. Prayers for us. - Might as well move into the church and come home once a week. - I'm sorry that you feel that way. I love you, Chekay. - I love you too, Kate. Come here. Just give me a moment. One moment. - Okay. (Jazz music) - You're here by yourself? - Yes. - No friends? Family? - Just me. - Very well. - Now, let's just stick to the plan, stay on our medication, yeah? And then we'll run some more tests for the next time you come in. I do not want you to worry about a thing. We're on top of it. See you during your next visit. - Sorry, ma. It's not going through. - Bad network. - Insufficient funds. - That cannot be true. - Kate? - Sorry, ma. - Lizzy. - Hey, you. Is everything okay here? - She came here to see Doctor Sugarbaum, but there's a problem with her card. - Give me her bill. Okay. This one, my lady, is on me. - Thank you, Elizabeth. - Hey. Do you have a minute? I was just on my way to the canteen. - Oh, I'm sorry, Lizzy. I'm late for work. - All right, call me. I want to hear every single detail of that yewai you had with Tola the other day. - You heard about it? - Come on, Kate. Me and Tola are like sisters now. Of course she called me to moan about it. And I told her to drive to your house immediately and apologise. Did she? - Everything is okay now. - I'm glad to hear. - Thank you. - All right, see you soon. - Bye. ♪ But do you know something, baby, life's gone down low ♪ ♪ Yeah, life's gone down low ♪ ♪ I can tell when I know so-so, down-low ♪ ♪ Life's gone down low ♪ ♪ Yeah, life's gone down ♪ ♪ Baby, you can come and listen to me ♪ ♪ I don't know yet what to do ♪ ♪ You can take ♪ ♪ And a little bit of understood being life's gone down low ♪ ♪ Yeah, life's gone down low ♪ ♪ Yeah, life's gone down, down, down, down ♪ (phone ringing) ♪ But it's not too late for me and you ♪ - Hi, it's Maria.

You will not believe what I just saw. - Is your madam in? - Yes, ma. - Kate, dear. - I know who's been sleeping with your husband. - Moses. - Sir? - Moses, open the gate. - But, Madam says I should not open the gate for you, sir. - Huh? - Yes, sir. Sorry sir. Good night, sir. (Phone rings) (phone buzzes) (phone rings) (phone buzzes) - Good evening, sir. - Open the gate for me. - Madam is asleep, sir. - And that's all right. Open the gate. - Madam said I shouldn't open the door for anybody, sir. - And since when have I become "anybody"? Open the gate, Kichi. - Madam said I shouldn't open the door for you, sir. - Open the damn gate, Kichi. - I'm sorry, sir. I can't open. - All right. All right. Good night, Kichi. - Thank you, sir. - Chekay, how are you, dear? Mm-hm. Kate left the house? Night vigil, huh? How your wife loves God. Anyway, the Ghost Shrine. You want to come? Yeah, I'll come pick you up. All right, all right. Bye. (Jazzy music) (cards shuffling) - Do the dealer's. - Thanks, course. There is twenty. There is twenty-five. Check or bet? Checks under the bets. Ten o-clock, seven o-clock, eight of diamonds. Check or bet, check or bet? Player plays hundred. Hundred or lose your place. Fold or call. Player calls for five hundred. Five hundred. Player goes all in. - [Voiceover] Welcome back to LLV, your number-one spot for celebrity news and gossip. I'm here with my co-host. - [Voiceover] Hey, welcome. - [Voiceover] And what are we going to talk about today? (Muffled news station) (coffee cup clinking) - No school today? - I don't have lectures until eleven a.m, so. - Okay. So, I will see you later. (Dramatic music) Shit. Just wait here, I won't be a moment. Okay? - No problem, ma. - Sammy? (Bass thumping) Sammy? - Ohh! Oh! (Music abruptly shuts off) - I'm sorry. - Out. (Sad music) - So, gentlemen, if you look at this slide, you would see this, our latest construction in Kalaba. As you can see, it's over fifty percent done. So if we go according to-- - I need to talk to you, Maria. - Couldn't you book an appointment? - Did you book an appointment when you poked your ugly nose into my marriage? - You have no right to be here. - And what right did you have, jumping into bed with my husband? - I don't know what you're talking about. - So you're still going to pretend as if you don't know me, api? - If you don't leave this room, I will call the police. - Oh. Go ahead! Call the police! I would love to see them try to arrest me, sir. I'm only going to say this once. Stay away from my husband. And as for that child you're carrying for him, in that rotten womb of yours? I hope you lose it. I hope you have a miscarriage. - Gentlemen. - How stupid can you get, Maria? Prostituting yourself around town. - Uncle. - Having an affair with a married man? - Uncle Martin! - How risque of you! Is it true you're pregnant? - Yes. - From that woman's husband? - Yes, uncle. - Thank god my brother is not alive to see you do this to him. - Uncle, please. Can you leave that out of this? - When were you planning to tell me? - Tell the company that you were pregnant. - I only found out yesterday. - I am disappointed in you, Maria. - I'm sorry, uncle. - Go home. Take some time off. Get your life back together. - Uncle! - Then you can come back to work. - Uncle, I'm in-- - Go home, Maria. - Yes, uncle. - How dare you, Lizzy! I thought we were friends! What are you talking about, Maria? - You know damn well what I'm talking about. She came barging into my board room, saying all sorts of scandalous things! - Well, they wouldn't be scandalous if they weren't true, now would they? Ave, Maria, stop playing the victim. You brought this on yourself. Take responsibility. - You're no friend of mine. It's quite clear now. You've never been a friend! - If asking you to take responsibility for your actions is a bad thing, then yes. I am no friend. - She came to my office. She humiliated me in front of my colleagues! Everyone knows I'm pregnant, Lizzy! You made a mess of my life, I hope you're happy now! - (Speaking Nigerian) Your life was messed up from the moment you decided to jump into bed with Kunle! - You don't know him, Lizzy! - I know him well enough. So, you were not the first and you will not be the last woman that Kunle has sneaked into bed with behind his wife. Come on, Maria. He tried it with me once. I told him where to get off. - You would, wouldn't you? He's at least thirty years too old for you! - Kunle is a serial philanderer. - I don't care what he is! All I know is he doesn't love her. - "He doesn't love her. They don't love each other. "Oh, dear." Wake up, Maria! - Where's all this wisdom that comes with age? Every single man that cheats gives the same excuse! - Every man is not your cheating, low life exhusband, Lizzy! - All I am saying is that he could've ended his marriage before taking up with you. - Oh. So, apart from being a doctor, you're now a toy! - I think with my head, Maria! That's what I do! Unlike you, who unfortunately and consistently thinks with her heart! Which is rather amazing, given how accomplished you are! - You know what? Just stay out of my business! - I am your friend, you fool, I can't stay out of your business! - Now, you did something wrong. Say so, and move on. - Well, there goes miss perfect. Who's going to London this week to get silly consommes for her breast? Not me. - Oh, sure. Says the botox junkie. - Well, who is going around sleeping with boys young enough to be her own sons? Not me! Oh. Who was caught shagging her own daughter's boyfriend? Not me, Lizzy. Do you know why you're always poking your nose into everyone's business? It's because you're lonely! Sort out your life, Lizzy! Oh. Where is your daughter? I rest my case. "Well, fifty is the new twenty-five." What a load of rubbish! Physician, heal thyself! Watch where you're going, honestly! - Kate, please. I apologise. Her head's not on correct this morning. Please, sit. Shouldn't you be on set? - Tola cancelled the shoot. Her parents are visiting. - What can I do you for? - I came to give you this. - Thanks for rescuing me yesterday. - Come on, Kate. I already told you. This is not a loan. It's a gift from a friend. - Thanks, Lizzy. I really appreciate it. But I can't. I can't. I can't take it anymore. - Kate. Talk to me. - I have put up with too much from her and I have had enough. I mean, it's just too much. I can't take it. I want this to be over. Everyone can go their separate ways. - Is this what you want? Is that what it'll take to stop all these ugly rumors that have been flying around all over Lagos? - (Speaking Nigerian) - Answer your father! - Go, Kunle. Who's begging you to stay anyway? Run to Maria. - Who's Maria? - Who is Maria? Maria is his mistress. His mistress that's carrying his child. - Look, don't listen to her. I mean, first she accused Kate, my best friend's wife. That didn't wash. Now she's accusing someone else. - God punish you, Kunle. - Profunda fire you, Tola! - You're a born liar! - (Speaking Nigerian) - He keeps having affairs! - (Speaking Nigerian) - I can only respect a man that respects himself! - (Speaking Nigerian) - Look at you, Tola! Look at you! - But he's the one out there sleeping around, making me a laughing stock! - (Speaking Nigerian) - You must respect your husband, you must respect him! - Daddy, if this sprawling mansion wasn't yours, if you weren't spoiling me the way a wealthy philanderer spoils his mistress, I would tell you to get out of this house right now, go to Budaigou Beach, and drown yourself! - Talk to your daughter. (Speaking Nigerian) - Kunle, let's take a walk in the garden. - Are you out of your mind? (Speaking Nigerian) - What do you think? - If you go around blabbing your mouth about this, you're the one who will suffer! I've told you before and I will tell you again: let bygones be bygones! - That's all you've ever said, all these years. Well, I'm sick and tired of this rancid secret that has ruined my entire life! That man is nothing but a beast! - He is still your father. - He's a beast! I have to get someone to slit his throat! - Stop talking that way! I know he was bad to you, very bad. But if this were to get out, what do you think people will say about you? Do you think you'll be able to cope with what they say? - What about what they'll say about him? What about what they'll say about you! Or isn't that what you're most concerned about, mother? A mother catches her husband raping his daughter, her daughter, and what does she do? She helps him cover it up. Well, bravo, mother. Bravo! - Don't you dare talk to me, you slut! - What did you just call me? - Running around the house half-naked, flaunting yourself in a towel? - I was in my parent's home! - Flaunting yourself! - So it was my fault? - I never said it was your fault. - No. You finally said it! It was my fault he forced himself on me! - Stop twisting my words! - Wow. Wow. - "Wow. Wow." Tola, you know the consequences for you, and for this family. You would destroy our entire family! Our entire lives will be laid waste to! - Well, mine was laid waste to a long time ago. Do you know why that spineless husband of mine, who's only stayed in this marriage because he married into wealth, do you know why he keeps having affairs? Because I can't even bear for him to touch me. Why else do you think we haven't started a family? Oh. You thought I was barren, right? Well, I'm not. - Why did you marry him, then? - Because I loved him. And I believe there was a time that he loved me too. - (Speaks Nigerian) Why did you marry him? - I married him because I thought marriage and companionship would rid me of all the memories of all the nastiness that happened. Well, obviously, that didn't work! - You should have let him go. You should have let him go a long time ago. It would have been cheaper. - I let him go. He just never left. - We will come to an arrangement with him. I'm so happy we solved that problem. - (Laughs) Oh my god. - (Speaks Nigerian) Oh hello Yolanda, Thank you (speaks Nigerian) ♪ I want you more than I need you ♪ ♪ I need you so bad ♪ ♪ Are you coming back, are you coming back ♪ ♪ I'm waiting ♪ ♪ I've been tired of dreaming a long time ♪ ♪ I've been unable to sleep ♪ ♪ Are you coming back, are you coming back ♪ ♪ I'm waiting ♪ ♪ I'm waiting ♪ - Chekay.
