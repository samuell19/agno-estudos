I already told you, love, I was born with it. All right.

Do yous want some real chips? - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. Come on. Do you want to hear a bedtime story about Saint Brigid? Yeah. Go on. So, Brigid prays to God and says, "Will You make the king of Ireland's heart all soft? 'Cause it's gone icy and like a rock or something." And God did, and she smiled and said to the king, "Will you give me as much land as this cloak will cover?" 'Cause she was wearing this cloak, just normal size, right? She bends down, and the cloak is magic, with the Holy God Spirit in it, and she tells her four sisters with her... They were like her sidekicks, right? They take a corner each and spread it out all over the land, and it goes out for miles. It's just like a miracle. And then the king says, "Well, Brigid, what's the story? How'd you do that?" And Brigid says, "It's 'cause you're being so stingy with all the poor people in your land." And he says, "All right, then, you can have loads of me land." And she gets it and starts a convent and helps all the people in the town. They start a farm where they made jam with the berries on the land. Hmm, like a little community center type of thing. But then everyone was grand. How do you remember all that? I don't like the way my teacher says it, so I remember it my own way. She's got a real moany voice. ♪ ♪ 35,000. 12 by four. You'll learn as you build. You need very, very few skills to be part of a team that'll build a house. Pass on the skills to your children. What can I do for you? I want to build a house. Um, these are some of the vacant sites that you have going spare. And the addresses are on the back. And this is how much it would cost me for the materials and a plumber and an electrician. It's 35,000 euro. You see, I figured out that I cost you 33,000 in rent and welfare in one year alone. Um... And at number 653 on the housing list, that's three or four years keeping us in hotels, which would cost you 120,000, maybe even more. But if you lend me the money and let me use a site, then I could have that built by Christmas, and be paying you rent for the house. Do you see what I mean? You'd even be making a profit. I'm really sorry. I can't help you with this. Dr. O'Toole... Bollocks. Jesus. Dr. O'Toole? Hello? Can you hear me? Dr. O'Toole? Listen, it's Sandra, your cleaner. Wake up. Come on. - Peggy? - Yeah. Oh, thank God. Dr. O'Toole, it's me. Will I call an ambulance? No. - No. I probably should. - No, no, no. - Just to be safe. - No. It's fine. Stop fussing. I must have fainted. I've not been able to eat. Are you sure now? 'Cause you have a cut. No. Well, if I was a horse, they'd shoot me, but I'm not. I'm a doctor, and I'd know if I needed to go to the hospital. So help me get up. - Okay. - Give me a hand. Here. You ready? Right. All good. I'm just gonna walk you back here. Right. Easy. Sit down there now. Yeah. Are you all right? - Hmm. - Okay. Do you feel dizzy or anything? Why didn't you ask me? Ask you? Ask you what? I have designed a house that costs just 35,000 euros to build. It's a self-build, so you can literally DIY a permanent home. I didn't mean for you to see that. Well, I did, so... here's my proposal. It's land, Sandra, going to waste. Use it. Build a house for you and your girls. Dr. O'Toole, this... Why would you do this? Your mother was far more than a cleaner to me. She was a friend. She helped me through some bloody awful times. I want to give you the land... and lend you the money to build your house. Not this much. - You can't. - I can. And you can pay me back over as many years as, as we decide. Hmm? What do you say? Is that a yes? Uh, yeah. Yeah. All right, now get back to work. Good woman. These are approximate figures, so you need to check all the costs before you commit. Where'd you get this? - Uh, online. - Online. Are these costs inclusive of VAT? Value added tax... are these prices plus or including? Yeah, I-I think... I-I'd say so. 'Cause there's a big difference. Yeah, I know. I'll be with you in a sec there. Onduline. Don't know what that is. Do you know what thickness of insulation it is? There's loads of sizes, like. Oh, yeah, no, uh... I'll-I'll ask. Biobase. Never heard of it. Wha-What about, um, like, basic concrete? Well, that's actual ready mix. It's-it's not bags? No. Concrete would-would have to come in a truck, in cubic meters. You'd have to go to Roadstone. Do you mind if I serve this fella? Yes, my friend, what can I get you? Some manners, a bit of courtesy. - What? - What? You're Customer Service. Serve the customer. She's only after a price check. It's not rocket science. You're throwing away the good bit. Can I ask your advice on something? I'm building a house, like a self-build. - Right. - And I'm only starting, but... I don't know where to start, I suppose. Where's your site? Have you got a field? A back garden. A woman I work for is giving me the land. Giving you it? Why is she doing that? Trying not to think about it too much. I would. Nobody does anything for nothing, not in this country. Well, I wouldn't live in it, but it's a roof and four walls, so what else do you need? You wouldn't come and have a look, - would you? - No, I can't, love. I have a flue to install, on a job that's growing arms and legs. It's only around the corner. I can't help you. I can't afford to. Look, you don't know me, but I think you worked with my ex Gary. Gary Mullen? - It's possible. - But? You're gonna need somebody who knows what they're doing. He means a man. No, I mean a person who's qualified to handle compliances, put in for planning. Could you be that person? I don't do contracts. I haven't done one in ages. W-We could pay you. We could pay you a... a consultancy fee or... For an agreed amount of days. Look, even if you do get planning, I'm guessing you're gonna want somebody who's gonna work every weekend for next to nothing. I'm no use to you. And I've just had a health scare. Dicky ticker. - There you are! - Grainne! Have a word with the architect, yeah? See if he has any ideas. I'm sorry, can't help you. Aren't you meant to be convalescing? What are you doing? Sorry, but do you know each other well enough to do this? She's Michelle's daughter. And Michelle was lovely and a really good cleaner, but... But what? She used to help herself to Dad's whiskey. Well, she did us all a favor there. I'm sorry, Sandra, could I just have a moment with Mum? No, Sandra, stay. Look, at the end of the day, it's none of my business. I get it. It's your land, your choice, but... What are you gonna do about Aisling's den? - Knock it down. - I'll let you... - I-I shouldn't be... - No, Sandra. - See you tomorrow, Dr. O'Toole. - Come back. What are you doing in the car? It's not even raining. "How was your day, Mammy?" "Grand, thank you, Emma." How was your day, Mammy? "Grand, thank you, Emma." - Green. - Green. Yeah, I've been ringing round loads of builders. Nobody's gonna work weekends. You've only got to say "self-build" to a builder, and he'll run a mile. But you are gonna need an expert.

We'll just use these, then. - Bye, Sandra. - Ciao, Sandra. Oh, thanks a million, girls. I'll see yous next week. Don't stay all night now. Fuck. - Here, Mam. - I wanted to... Oh, Jesus, love. I'm sorry. Mam, make it stop! Make it stop! - Okay. Dr. O'Toole! - Ow! - Mam! Mam! - Peggy! - There. Sorry, love. I'm sorry. - Mam, make it stop. - Ow! Ow! - I'm so sorry. So sorry, love. Oh, my God. I cut her arm with a screw and... That is a nasty old cut. Now, Nurse Molly? - Yeah? - I have a big brown leather bag in the cupboard under the stairs. - Would you bring it for me? - You all right, love? Okay. -And, Mummy, can I have a bowl of warm water? Thank you. We'll get this cleaned up. Hold your hand right above your head as high as you can. There you are. Good girl. That's a good girl. See. Ah, here we are. Here's your sister. She's got it all worked out. - I know, I know, I know. - So, first of all, we're going to clean it up. All right. Here. Give it here. Got to get it clean, you see. There you go. Good girl. - I'm sorry, love. - Now, can you see in there, - this little box here? - Mm-hmm. Put these little things on. Now, these are a lot nicer than stitches. - Ow. - It's all right, love. All okay? - What happened here? - Yes, Aido and Francis. She'll be all right. Now, we're coming up to a big decision now. We're going to have a plaster hold this together. Is it going to be Elsa or Anna? Elsa. Elsa. I thought it might be. Emma, love, what were you doing there, sweetheart? Why were you there? Doesn't matter. Emma. Daddy told me to give this to you. Sorry. Sorry. I just don't want them to see me like this. Why not? I miss him, Peggy. Gary, I mean. Like, I mean, I don't miss him. I mean I miss who he was. It's like it's all the wrong way around. I wish I could bring it back. I want to fix it, you know? I know, I know. But you know, however much you may want to, there are some people who... you just can't. Why don't you stay here tonight? Have some proper food and a sleep? I can't. I can't risk Gary finding out about this. I can't. Sandra, darling, we're gonna have to draw a line here. I cannot have the kids running around... I know. I know. Yeah, well, what if the inspector was to drop...? All right, Aido. I know. Listen, I can't be here for the next couple of weekends. Leave everything till I get back. It can wait. Emma, come here, sweet. Now, this is just like the safety box, all right? What do you say? - I hurt it playing in the hotel. - All right. It's just a white lie, yeah? White lies don't count, do they? - Love you. - Love you. Will you go in and see your dad? Please. Oh, Molly. This is bullshit. Kidney infection? For the last month? Like, are you grooming her or something? No. Obviously not. You're obviously not looking after them, are you? Keep her, but I know when you're lying to me, Sandra. I always know.

Ms. Kelly, I had to sign for this for you. Breach of access? That prick is lucky to see those kids at all, and now he's taking me to court! Breach of access is an offense. You have to attend. You have to tell your side of the story. Oh, great. Well, shall I get out me A4 pad and we'll get started, will we? - Fuck's sake! - If you fight this with that kind of attitude, he'll win. I've seen it, Sandra. I've seen men get barring orders back against the women they've hit. I'm telling you, we can either calmly put forward your side of the story, or you can go into mediation ranting and raving and risk losing custody of the kids altogether. How many visits did Molly miss? I don't know. Seven? Eight? Oh, Jesus, Sandra. She literally wouldn't get out of the car, Jo. What was I supposed to do? You can't let Molly dictate terms. Is that what you say to a crying child? I'm sorry, love, but legally, he has a right to do this. I know it's frustrating. Any more news on the house front? No. This needs to go up against this porch. - Yeah. Got it? - I got it. Ah, here's herself. Hello. I want one of them Banham locks for the front door. Do you know, do you know those ones, they, like, they flick open really easy on the inside but then they're real secure? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what they are. It's just, you're on a budget. Well, I want one. Well, you can't afford one. Jesus. Aido, you ask me for a million decisions a day, and then I finally give you a freebie, and it's... And it's fucking "Why, why, why," or it's, or it's too much. Fuck's sake! Will you stop looking at me?! Stop looking at me! Just get back on with it, will you? The house is never gonna get done. Sandra. Oh, will you stop bleeding staring at us? Sandra. Sandra. What is going on? What the fuck is the point? Jesus Christ. What? I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. What is the point of a house... ...if I have no kids to put in it? Sandra... we should go. - Maybe I should ring the girls, just... -Oh, the girls are fine. I spoke to Rosa. They're happy out. You relax. I have a present for you. From Amy. Hope it's only tobacco. There's Jo. Was there a reason you didn't leave sooner? I... I did try to. Uh, I-I wanted to, loads of times. I-I made a safety box. I just didn't have anywhere to go. Mr. Mullen, you claim that Molly hasn't attended access on eight occasions? - Yes, Judge. -You've been keeping up maintenance? Yes, Judge. Okay. Ms. Breen. Thank you, Judge. Ms. Kelly, last time we spoke, you described suffering psychological and physical abuse throughout your relationship. - Is that correct? - Yes. And when I specifically asked you whether Mr. Mullen had ever harmed your children, you said no. Is that correct? Yes. Do you believe he has harmed them on access visits? No. Your Honor, we have new evidence to bring to court. Articles 1, A to C, are photos of Mr. Mullen's eldest child Emma. On Sunday, August 7, Emma was dropped at her father's place of residence with a bandage on her left arm, as you can see. When questioned about this, Emma said she hurt it "making something in the garden with Mammy." This did not match what Mr. Mullen was told by Ms. Kelly, who claimed it happened in the hotel, where they temporarily reside. We have evidence that suggests that Emma was indeed "making something in the garden" of a Dr. Margaret O'Toole, who is, in fact, allowing Ms. Kelly to build a house - at her property. - Judge, I-I... - Judge, I can, I can explain... - Please wait, Ms. Kelly. Ms. Breen, what relevance does that have to this hearing? The matter is for another courtroom. Judge, if this hearing is about the character of these parents and which one is a more suitable guardian to the children, it's certainly worth noting that Ms. Kelly did not inform Dublin City Council about this build or her change of circumstances. No. Dr. O'Toole got planning. Uh, it was her property. And Ms. Kelly lied on an assessment form. When asked in June of this year if you'd received a loan or had other housing options, you wrote "N/A," "not applicable," did you not? I-I-I didn't lie. Well, it's on that form, Sandra. Are you trying to get two houses instead of one? No. No. Judge, is this a fit mother? No. You're not doing this! You are not doing... You are not taking my kids! All right, all right. 20 minutes' break while I go over this new evidence and your client calms herself. They might take the girls because she fudged some bloody form? Yes. Yes, they might. Because when it comes to legally binding forms, you have to tell the truth. Truth in the right tone of voice, though, isn't it? Tell the truth? Don't tempt me. I'll be here all fucking week. Come here to me. Of course you were gonna stay on the housing list. Anything could have happened. - Yeah, but look what I've done. - Sandra, you're building a home for your children. You're working day and night to give them a childhood that they've been denied, and then, every weekend, you have to drop them home to that fucker. Do they have any idea what that takes? I can't. I can't lose them. - No. - I can't lose... And you won't, you won't. Come on. You won't. I know you didn't stop Molly going to see her father. She didn't want to, and you listened to her. I'm so impressed by you, Sandra. You know... most of us get so sunk in our own pain, we don't notice our children's, but you did. And that makes you a good mother, and they've got to see that. You know, Jo's right. You go out there and you tell them the truth. All right? Oh. One more thing. Come here. There. There's Sandra. Mr. Mullen, has Emma recovered from her injury, in your opinion? Yes, Judge, but I don't want me kids in an unsafe environment. Unsafe? - Ms. Kelly. - Gary, that was a scrape. How many times has Emma done that coming off her scooter? Okay. Let's just for a moment look at the facts here. The report says Molly has missed eight access visits. Mr. Mullen hasn't missed one. He's paid child maintenance. He's done everything that was legally required. Because that's what he does. He does what's required, but that's not... Fact, Ms. Kelly. Whereas you have not. Why is that? Ask better questions. I beg your pardon? Ask him why he's using the children as pawns in front of us all, while we're all wondering why I didn't fill in a form right? You want to know why I didn't let Molly go? Because she was hiding in the wardrobe... pissing on herself... because she was so scared of seeing you. She saw, Gary. She saw you that day. She watched you punch my face and pull my hair and wreck my hand. And you didn't see her, but she saw. And I can't make her unsee that. But, Christ, I'm her mother and I'll listen. I'd do it again. I would. I'd do it a million times over. And making out that I'm a bad person? That I'm a bad mother? When you all know what he did to me? You all know from the Garda reports and the medical reports, and yet you still bring me in here and you put me through this, sit me in the same room with him, ask me questions like, "Why didn't you leave him?" But you never ask, "Why didn't he stop?" Ms. Kelly, take a seat. This type of injury could have come from a playground, a tumble in the street. But it didn't, Ms. Kelly. It happened in your care. Albeit while you were in the process of building a house, to secure your children's future. I understand Molly has witnessed something she shouldn't, but I cannot condone parental alienation. I order that the children be assessed in the coming months to establish their needs, what they truly want. But for now... the terms of access remain. Mr. Mullen, you will not get custody today. However, Ms. Kelly, if you want to build yourself a house, you must take full responsibility for that. You must inform Dublin City Council that you wish to be taken off the housing list. Your right to rent allowance will cease when you and the children move into this new house. - Understood? - Yes, Judge. Very well. The court is adjourned. All rise. I'm keeping me kids. - Oh, shit, your hip. - Oh, bugger the hip. I'm so happy for you. Oh. Thanks. Guess what, girls. Aido said we can move in in three days. - Wow. - Cool. Want to see what's in your room? -Yeah! -Yeah! Oh, my God. Oh, no. Molly. Wow. This is such a cool bedroom. I know, I love it. Can you imagine sleeping here now, Molly? Oh, my God. - Girls! - Wow. - Wait for me. - Molly, come look. Did you see the table? This, Dariusz made this. It's lovely, isn't it? - Yeah. - Yeah. - All we need now is the chairs. - Mm-hmm. Or we can be just sitting like this. - Yeah. - Yeah. Surprise! Jesus, my heart. Congratulations, you ledge! - Whoo! - You did the kitchen? Uh, that was mainly me. Me hole, was it. Yewande was at it all day. - Oh, thanks. - Here. - From all of us. - Oh, my God. Look at the box. Oh, look. Me own doorknob. Thanks a million! - Come here, will you take a picture? -Ah, yeah, go on. Yewande and everyone, will you get up on the stairs? Oh, yeah. We're allowed photographs now, are we? All right, smart-ass. Come on, it's a group photo.
