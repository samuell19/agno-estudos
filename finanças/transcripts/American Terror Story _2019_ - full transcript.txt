Are you okay? - You look sick. - Look, I need to use the bathroom, can I use the bathroom? - No! - Please. Did you hear that? What are you talking about? She's following me. Are you okay? Well, if you're not gonna talk to me, just don't come back. I don't wanna see you again, I just. Oh come on, come on. Molly, Bobbi, Molly. No. No, no, no, no. Why? Dammit, Alvin, I'll call the police. Sarah. Oh, hey. How'd you do? How do you mean? On the test. I did pretty all right, how about you? Less than. History just doesn't click with me. I could seriously use a study buddy if you're interested. I don't know... Oh, come on, it'll be fun. You can come over to my new place, which I know you haven't been to yet, and I could make you a smoothie and you could help me get my grades up. Yeah, yeah, sure. Oh, perfect, thank you. I'll text you with the address later. - Okay, see ya then. - Bye. Surprisingly edible. Right? Oh hey, how's that, are you writing that one thing? What was it? I don't know. You know, sometimes I just hate how much I love to write. Like, I've been trying to write this book for two years now, but I just keep getting distracted and writing stupid things that don't even matter. Like what? I don't know. I guess I'm just looking for the right inspiration. Whatever that is. Look, all you need to know is that the transcontinental railroad was build between 1863 and 1869, and that connected the San Francisco Bay Area with... See that's the problem right there, I don't remember dates and names very well, so. Okay, well, should we come up with a pneumonic device to help you out? Probably, yeah. Okay. It's my roommate. Oh, my God. Jesus, it is about frickin' time. The door was unlocked, dumb ass. - Oh, I resent that, okay? - Great. Oh, hey you. It's Sarah. Yeah, from biology class, what's goin' on? Okay, go away, we're studying. Oh yeah, excuse the hell out of me for trying to assault her... Also, can you pick up your shit? - Yeah, Mom. - Great. Okay, transsexual railroad 1869. I didn't know that you and Josh were roommates. Oh yeah, I try to forget about it. Oh, how long have you known each other? Uh, since middle school I think. We kinda grew up together, our parents are neighbors. - Didn't know that. - Yeah. How long have you lived together? Wait a minute. Wait, seriously? I didn't say anything. No, this would be perfect. He would totally go for your type. Forget it, it's, what do you mean your type? Um, you know like, cute nerdy girl that likes to write and wears glasses. But honestly though, he's a really good guy and once you get to know him, he's pretty great. Once you get past his rock and roll shit, stick thing he's doing. So, he's single? No he's not. He has a girlfriend, but she's a bitch. So, I think that you'd be a lot better for him. No, no, I'm not the kinda girl to swoop in like some vulture and snatch up boys from their girlfriends. So, Walter is having a little shindig over at this creepy ass old house that his uncle bought. The bud will be blowin' and the drink will be flowin'. Did you make that up yourself? - Yeah, I did. - You should get more. - Thank you for that. - It's good. Yeah, so are we gonna do this or not? Hell yeah. Sweet. Oh, I think I'm just gonna stay in tonight. Oh, well I'm gonna go and take a shower, so. You're just gonna stay in? It's last minute. Come on, Sarah. How do you expect to be a writer if you don't have any personal experience? No, I'm serious, like two minutes ago you were talking about how you need some inspiration. This could be it, you never know. You might make some new friends, and if you don't have any fun, I will personally escort you home. She's here. Nice of you to show up. - What did I do this time? - What did you do? Do you see how your daughter talks to me? Where do you think you're going? To my room. We're your parents, we deserve to know where you've been. You know, we put food on your table and a roof over your head. You live here, you live under our rule. Are you even listening to me? Get your hand off of me. God. God dammit. Okay, you know what? I thought that once I went to college, maybe things would change around here. But you just sit there and you let her go at me every god damn day. So you wanna know something, mom? I'm gonna go hang out with my fucking friends, okay? Something you wouldn't know anything about. Ouch. God, is this necessary? No. Then why are we doing it? Because this is what girls do to get ready for parties. See, that wasn't so bad. I am really not the type for this sort of thing. Everybody's the type for this sort of thing. Even guys need a little makeover every once in a while. Their skin's always so dry. I don't know, makeovers and makeup's just not my thing. Think I look fine without it. Oh, definitely. You're beautiful, but this is just gonna make some of your best features pop. I'm glad you could make it. Sarah, yeah. It should be interesting. Yeah, well, at least you two look nice. Thanks. So how's the band going? Ah, it's okay, I guess. Our drummer keeps flaking out on rehearsal. It's a little shaky right now, but you know how it is. But, I did bring my acoustic so I can play us some tunes. Sounds good. Sarah, what do you do? I work a bookstore on campus. Not your job, I mean, what do you really do? Uh, I'm a writer, I guess. What, like stories? Yeah, stories mostly. That's cool. I like to think I write stories myself through my music. So how far are we? We're not too far. What exactly is this place? I'm not really 100% sure. I guess Walter's uncle bought this abandoned house and he's tryin' to have a party there before they tear it down or something. Makes sense to me. Wait, who's this Walter guy? He's a friend of ours. Oh you know him, he's the ginger guy with the skinny little ass. In love with his car. Yeah, I'll definitely recognize him now, thanks Kelsey. So, what part of town are we win? Somewhere on south side, it's a dinky little place. Barely even part of town at all. Yeah, it's kinda shitty. I don't know, I kinda like it. It's got like this small town vibe to it. I have to agree. Oh, God. I hate sitting down for long periods of time. I get motion sickness really bad. I'm gonna... Yeah. Sup guys? Find the place all right? Ah, not too bad. Here, big guy. Hey, always a pleasure. You cut off all your hair, man. Yeah, it was time for a change. Real smart, man. I mean, I know you're not, but you look like it. Who's this? This is Sarah. She is one of Kelsey's friends. Ah, and where's that troublemaker? Walter! Whoa, holy shit. How are you doin' sweetheart? - I'm good. - Good, good. Have you met my friend, Sarah? I have, Josh was just introducing us and doing a terrible job as usual. Hey. So you guys ready to check it out? Let's do it. I love this one. Are you guys ready to get this party started? - Hell yeah. - Yeah. So how many people are coming tonight? Well, only a couple of people actually got back to me, besides you guys. Didn't feel like calling it off since we weren't gonna have the house much longer. So it's just us then? How is this a party? Well, Jodie and Paul stopped by earlier. Drank four of my beers and then went to get something to eat. And Bobby said he'd stop by later with his crew, but you know those guys, so. So not really all that popular this week, are we? Nobody wants to party with us. Oh, speak for yourself, man. I mean, we've got the J and we've the tunes and we've got the brews. So, sounds like a party to me. Um, I've only actually done this once before and it didn't really do anything. It's cool, nobody feels anything their first time. It's easy, just relax and take in a deep breath. Oh, okay Yeah, feelin' it this time? Yeah, I think so. I've always heard if you're not coughin', you're not feelin' it. Wow, who knew you were such a philosopher. Hey, I totally am. Who knows that we're here? - My uncle, he's cool with it. - Oh. Does your uncle drive like a beat down truck? No, he drives a Mercedes. Like a really nice S Class, with a VNC TGPS. Forward lookin' infrared. It's fast as hell, man. It's like five and a half liter, turbo charged V12 with a six speed automatic. He's too loaded to drive a truck. I'm just tryin' to be that good nephew. There's a lot to be said about a man with no kids and more money than he spend before he dies. Wow, piece of shit. No, it's not like that. He's my uncle, I love him, but I mean, he's a racist and he hates women. So, I mean fuck him, right? You know what that reminds me of? We should take shots. Now that's an idea. All righty. So tell me about this truck. Oh, it's nothing. I think that the weed is just getting to me, feeling paranoid or something. Here, take this. It'll help loosen you up. Um, not really sure I wanna get drunk tonight. Who said anything about getting drunk, it's one shot. What should we cheers to? This dope ass house. To the dope house. To the dope house. You know, this place really is cool. When was it built? I don't know, old. I bet you that, looking at the stonework outside it's probably like the turn of the century or something. Sarah, really? We are a party and all you can talk about is the architecture of the house. Hey, leave her alone, man. This place is pretty legit. We should go check it out. May as well. I mean, nobody else is here, right? Guys, really? Hey, we might find like a big bag of money or something. Or a bag full of pot. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Where do you think it goes? I don't know if we should open that. Yeah, no. No, no, no, no. There could be a bum down there that has been squattin' for God knows how long, and he heard us partying and I am not about to deal with a pissed off hobo. I'm just sayin'. - Oh, God. - Not doin' it. Does anybody have a pocket knife? Ooh. - Yeah. - What, I was a boy scout. Right. For like six months. Well all right then. Thank you, sir. You guys see anything down there? It's, it's not that impressive. Oh, my God. Walter! What? Really? Hey, check it out. What is it? Come see. What the fuck was that? I don't know, it sounded like it came from inside the house. I think it came from the front room. Let's go. Walter. Now, what the fuck is goin' on here? Excuse me, who are you? Yeah, I could ask the same question. You teenagers think you can just come in here and break in private property and start stealin' shit? What do you think this is, a third world country? It's god damn America boy, and we got laws around here. Now you guys better leave before I get my gun and I make you. First of all, sir, we're not teenagers. And second of all, this property belongs to Jeffery Daniels, I'm his nephew, Walter. Walter Daniels. Yeah, I don't know a Walter Daniels. Look, I don't mean to be rude man, but at this point, you're the one that's trespassing, and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave or I'm gonna be forced to call the police, all right? And tell 'em what? Explain to them what the hell you guys are doin' in here? I mean, come on, give me a break. Now, listen here, I'll cut you guys a deal. You don't call the cops, all right? I'll let you continue your little party, and you share some of those goodies with me. Let me get this straight. You're gonna come in here and ask to party with us after you barge in uninvited, unannounced, and then threaten to kick us out with your gun? Is that about right? All right, some things were said. Yeah. It's cool now. Come on, guys, I'm just like you. I like the simple pleasures of life. I like a good beer. I like some good old fashioned American reefer. Now just share it with me and it's good. Come on, guys. - Fuck this guy. - I agree, fuck you, guy. Why don't you come say that to my face, you little bitch. I just did. Hey, you know what? You know what, how about we all just head out, all right? Seriously? You would rather leave than party with Dewayne? - Yeah. - Yes, yes. Definitely, absolutely would. Suit your fuckin' selves then. You know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna call the cops my damn self. You know, I'm gonna tell 'em that you're over here sellin' dope and you're makin' porno movies. Oh, oh, that's a good one. You guys need to leave and I mean now. Thanks for the beer, asshole. Are you about to let this guy kick us outa here? Yeah man, the party's over. Have a good night, Dewayne. Fuck you and your red shoes. Uh huh. Fuckin' kids. What the hell? Who's there? Jeeper. What are you doin'? Don't do this. Please. Don't do it. I don't see why we couldn't just stay here to party. Why didn't we go to your house? Your place is fuckin' huge. I just thought it would be exciting. You can't say it wasn't interesting. Interesting is an understatement, my friend. I wonder what was in the basement? Oh, sorry. You know, I'm actually not feeling that good. I think I'm gonna turn in, sorry. It's all right. We'll hang out next time, right? Right. Want me to walk you out? Yeah, thanks. You okay? You wanna talk about something? I think that I saw something in the basement. Yeah, like what? I don't know, I keep on trying to convince myself that it was Walter's shadow, but I'm not so sure. Forget it, it's stupid. Sarah, just tell me. I thought that I saw a little girl standing behind Walter, but then when he went to flash his light on her, she was gone. And I know what it sounds like, but... A little girl in the basement of a house that's been locked from the outside. She okay? Yeah, she'll be fine. She just got a little spooked is all. Where are you going? Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Well, um, yeah. It's, the night's still sorta young and it is a weekend. So, I don't know, I just, I know this really cool place, it's just a few blocks away. I was thinkin' we could go and we could check it out if you want to. Um, okay, yeah. Why not. Cool, well, I'll drive. Okay. Well, I think it's probably time that I head home. You good to drive, buddy? No, but I've been worse. Tuck Josh in for me, will ya? - Will do. - Appreciate it. Sorry it's kind of a mess in here. We haven't really been in here in a while, you know? Feels good though. Kinda makes me feel creative again. You should play me something. - Ooh. - Oh, come on. I've never heard you play before. Uh, that's no surprise, Kelsey hates our band. The fuck? Come on. Oh, thank God. What, oh, my God. Whoa, whoa. This is gonna scratch my car. What? Hello? Yeah. What do you mean? There wasn't anything wrong with him, was there? Are you kidding? Walter was one of the happiest people I've ever met. He had financial security. Got that new car. He loved that thing. You guys don't think it had anything to do with that house, do you? What are you talking about? You gotta admit, there was something off about that place. Okay, the pentagram that we found in the basement, and last night I had this crazy dream. Oh, my God, Sarah. This is not one of your story books, okay? This is real life. Our friend killed himself. Kelsey! You know, Kelsey, I didn't mean to upset you. Kelsey. Great. She'll be fine. Yeah, I know. It's my fault. I probably shouldn't have jumped to occult theory so soon. You don't really think it has anything to do with that house, do you? I don't know, maybe. It's just this feeling that I get. You know, maybe I'm crazy, but I think that we should go back. Well, I did leave my knife there, and there was half a joint in the ashtray. We probably need to go back and clean that up before Walter's uncle gets there. Hope he doesn't blame anything on our party last night, and that redneck Dewayne. He'll find any excuse to start shit. Yeah, let's go. Okay. What the hell is he doing here? I don't know. I say we find out. Do you smell that? It's even worse than last time. That is definitely not the same smell as last time. Did somebody throw up in here last night? Not that I'm aware of. - Oh, shit. - What? Oh, my God, oh shit. - Oh, shit! - Shit! Oh, what the fuck happened to him? Oh, my God, I think he shot himself. Something is going on. Careful. Should we call the police? Hell no, I am not gettin' blamed for that. We need to get outa here. So, what's next? I don't know. So the library, huh? You do know there's this cool thing called the internet? I don't know if you've heard of it. We're at the library because some of the information I need might not be on the internet. Also, I can always get more work done here, rather than at some little coffee shop. And what exactly are we looking for? Not really sure. I did have a pretty weird dream last night, though. It was about the house. There was this little girl there and someone called her Hei'an. I think she was a child bride or something. Wait a second, you're basing your research on a nightmare that you had? Yeah, but. Okay, I am almost positive that I saw that little girl in the basement, standing behind Walter. She was just standing there, and then he goes to turn his light on her, but she disappeared. - Disappeared? - Yeah. Like a ghost, disappeared? Maybe? I'm not buyin' into it. Enough crazy shit has happened to us since we left that house to warrant some questions. Don't you think? Yeah, no shit. If you'da told me a week ago that Walter was gonna commit suicide and that I was gonna find a dead redneck on the floor of an abandoned house, I would've said that you are having a bad acid trip, my friend. What are you lookin' at? So this says that the second owner of the house, Charlotte Morgan, was arrested multiple times between 1900 and 1904 for different counts of prostitution and pandering. In December, 1908, she sold the house and disappeared. Okay, what good does that do us now, though? It doesn't, but it's the only lead that we have. So you're saying that this child that you may or may not have seen, might or might not be the ghost of a Chinese child prostitute? And she made Walter kill himself? I can't believe this. No, I can't believe you. No, no, no, no, you listen to me. Walter was one of my best friends in the entire world and I cannot believe that you are doing this to me right now. Kelsey. Kelsey? Kelsey! Kelsey are you, oh shit! Move. Kelsey, oh, my God, Kelsey. Oh, my God, Kelsey. Can I come in? I'm sorry about your friends. If you wanna talk about anything, I just want you to know, I'm here for you. It's not even anything you could understand. Maybe not. I think something is killing us. When I went out the other night, we went to this old abandoned house. We were gonna throw a little party away from everyone else. But, I think that a ghost, spirit or something, has been following us ever since. Making us kill ourselves. Okay, I don't even care what you think. I just wanted to tell somebody about it. It's okay, it's okay. You just promise you won't tell Mom, okay? Maybe if there's something occult in the works, we could find some kind of ritual or something. Fuck it, if we're gonna die. I say let's do it together. What are you talking about? This has been by far the shittiest week of my life. Two of my best friends are dead and now we're being hunted by a fucking ghost child. I'm just sayin', I don't think that there is a way out of this. Okay so, you wanna just give up and accept death? I mean, what do you want me to do? We're runnin' out of options here. I mean, we're dyin'. What? Okay, you know, I really didn't think that you were the kinda guy that would give up so easily. Well I don't think you understand the situation. We are going to die, Sarah. There's no way outa this. Says who? Sarah, come on. You know, I don't give a shit whether or not you wanna quit, but I'm not gonna stop looking until I'm dead like Kelsey and Walter or until I can end this thing, and you can either help me or you can die. So we'll just talk to her. It will be fine. We should've called you sooner. I'm here to help. - Thank you. - It's no problem. Oh, here she is now. Hey, Sarah. Hey, Sarah, I want you to come meet Dr. Schafer. Pleased to meet you, Sarah. Please, sit down. Let's have a little chat. What is this? Well, actually, it's about you, Sarah. Your parents have become worried enough that they asked for help. So you're a shrink? Sarah, your mom and dad tell me that you have had some friends commit suicide recently and that you're having some hallucinations. We're just worried that you've experienced some trauma from losing so many people in such a short period of time. Sorry, I really, I can't do this. - Sarah, wait. - Please just stop. Hold on, let her go. Let's leave her alone for now. She's gonna be okay, right? Fuck. God. Oh, my God. God, that bitch. Oh, my God, are you kidding me? Fuckin' God. Molly, go down to the basement and get us a couple more bottles of wine. Oh, God. Miss Charlotte. Go back up and tend to the customers, child. But Miss Charlotte. I said, go. Poor child. Waste not, want not. Yes? Good morning, is Sarah in? What's this have to do with? This man here, his name is Josh Sloane. A friend of his found his body recently in a band rehearsal space. His roommate, Kelsey Cox, was also found recently deceased. Oh, my God. Sarah was a friend of both of theirs, and my understanding is she may have been the last person to see him alive. I would like to ask her a few questions. Sure, she's upstairs. I'll go get her. Is she a suspect? The owner of the practice space said he heard Sarah and Josh have an argument the night before. We really can't assume anything. - Come on in. - Thank you. She's not here. She must be at the library. She goes early when it's not too busy. She does a lot of research there. She's trying to be a writer. Dispatch, I'm gonna need a BOLO. Person of interest, Sarah Jensen. Brunette, Caucasian, female. Five foot, nine. Five foot, nine, about 115 pounds, 24 years of age. You will need to contact me if she calls or if she comes by. Thank you. That asshole left his folder. It's fucking ridiculous. Fuck. One other person, a young asian girl known only as Hei'an, has said to have been seen at the premises recently. Hei'an. Son of a bitch. Dispatch, I'm gonna need backup at my location. I've got a body. Hey, Sarah Jensen. Oh, my God. Okay, sweetheart, I'm gonna have to ask you to drop that weapon and get your hands up where I can see 'em. What the fuck is going on? What's going on is we're gonna have a little chat about your dead friends Kelsey Cox and Josh Sloane. Drop it. But Josh Sloane isn't dead. - Drop it. - Fuck. Turn around, get 'em up. Yeah, Josh is dead. What the fuck is that? What is that? You fucked us. Don't you fuckin' move. Dispatch this is Parker, where's that backup? Please, just let me do this, you don't know... Shut up! Dispatch, this is Parker, do you copy? You don't know what the fuck you're doing, dude. - Dispatch. - You don't know what you're doing! - Okay, fuck you. - Jesus christ. Get off. Hey, get off! Let's go, up, up, up. Let's go. Up, we need to talk about it. - Open the door! - Oh, my God. Open the fucking door. This isn't me I'm not doing this. I'm trying to, I'm only trying to help you. Open the god damn. Officer down, officer. Oh, my God. Hei'an. Hei'an. Hei'an. Hey look at me. I can help you, please. Hei'an, I can help you. Please, quit. Oh, my God. Thank you, God. Hello, Sarah, how did you sleep? Dr. Robinson tells me that he has changed your medication to something a little stronger to help you with your nightmares. I know this not ideal, but you're gonna have to work through this. These delusions that you're having about your friends and this spirit child. When did they begin? I'm just trying to help you. Things will get better, I promise. Don't make promises you can't keep. Subtitles by explosiveskull
