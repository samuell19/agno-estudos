Zhao Wuji, you shouldn't be here today Why not? Because it's your wedding day You shouldn't die on this day If I really have to die, it's better to die today I don't wish to leave a widow behind Drop your sword Why didn't you kill me? The reason for our duel today... is because you thought I was not your match There's simply no grudge between us Plus today is my big day I don't want to kill Goodbye Congratulations on your son's wedding Thanks, thank you... for attending my son's wedding Please enjoy yourselves... Representative from the Tang Clan is here Did you send out the invitation, Shangguan? No Dafeng Hall has invited almost everyone except us, the Tang Clan of Shu Province Why is that? Tang Clan is famous for its poisonous weapons We'd be better off without you Our master Tang Chueh has asked me... to deliver a generous gift 10,000 taels of gold The money is on the head... of the chief of Dafeng Hall If anyone can bring to us... the head of Zhao Jian, He will be rewarded with another 100,000 taels Wait a minute Take this message back to your master Say, even if one day... my head is in your hands My eyes will stay open to see the downfall of your Tang Clan Sikong, please see the guest out Yes Please Don't tell Wuji about what happened Yes chief Young master Qing, am I late? Not yet, hurry up Is the bride ready? It's almost time The young lady is ready Uncle Sikong, where's my dad? Brother Wuji What is it? Dad... Dad Who was with dad just now? Mr. Shangguan Swordsman Shangguan is here Please have a seat, Mr. Shangguan Please Master Tang, Mr. Shangguan is here You brought Zhao Jian's head with you? I wouldn't be here without it Great, call my brother Tang Yu Master Tang Yu What is it, big brother Tang Chueh? Go take a look at Zhao Jian's head Yes. The Triple Sword style... of Shangguan Ren lives up to its reputation What was that all about? I had to test you... to make sure you're the real Shangguan Ren Zhao Jian is dead It isn't so important whether that's his head But it's important that you are Shangguan Ren Master Tang, it's the head of Zhao Jian And this is Mr. Shangguan Ren You've made the right choice coming to us Shangguan Ren, from now on you will... be glad about your switch What are you doing here? Tell us We are all members of Dafeng Hall We want to avenge the chief's death Right, we want revenge, revenge Nonsense, Dafeng Hall is the head of alliance If you're all gone... The Tang Clan can take advantage of that Who's going to protect our Dafeng Hall then? If our clan is destroyed and the evil... Tang Clan dominates the martial arts world What can we do then? Wuji, I don't want to let you go But you've lost your father I know I can't stop you from going No matter how difficult it is I will find Shangguan Ren Your father once told me that... we have a spy named Xishi He works undercover at Tang Clan Xishi? I don't even know who he is But he'll contact you then Another thing; You must be aware that... Your father kept a confidential document inside a jade tiger Shangguan Ren took the jade tiger with him Before you kill Shangguan Ren... You must get him to surrender the jade tiger Jade tiger? Jade tiger I'm not sure if I can complete my mission If I'm not back by next autumn... when the flowers fall; don't wait for me I owe you The fallen blossoms would still be here I'd stay with the fallen blossoms Waiting for you here forever It's a good verse I promise you, I'll come back even if I die Dugu Sheng, not today Although I want to kill But you're not the one I want dead Zhao Wuji, you're mistaken indeed I'm not like the rest of them I have no intention to fight with you And I haven't brought my sword Then why are you here? Who knows when we'd be able to meet next! I'd like to have a farewell drink with you Cheers I wish this were the blood of Shangguan Ren Other than to say my goodbye... I'd like to let you know that, Me and my sword are here at your disposal Just let me know if you need any help Take care... till we meet again It's still early, why are you telling the time? I'm striking the heartbroken tone, not the time The heartbroken tone? Someone's about to die That's why I'm heralding this tone You aren't blind Of course I am. Look What else would you call that? It's the Tang's Thunderbolt bomb You are from the Tang Clan? Notjust me, we all are And this isn't the heartbroken tone This is the death knell Liu Sangeng, the Killer Watchman Death comes with the sounds Zhao Wuji, you've been hit with our poison Where are you running to? Who is it? A kid in red... with a red lantern and a red umbrella Why him? Why do you have to kill? Let's go You are... You're awake, master... That man is awake Where am I? This is a place with no hatred Who are they? We are people with no names Another of Tangs' trick? You're way out of line We aren't killers and no one can lay a finger on him They are all swordsmen with unparalleled skills They have forsaken fame and fortune... to lead rather an ordinary life My student went to the washroom On his way he unintentionally saved you So you're the legendary chief of the Hate-free Hall The Unique Man on the Carriage? That's right, I'm the one who always sits... in a carriage and never kills Please excuse my rudeness Are you badly hurt? I got poisoned But your heart suffers the most damage I can tell from your eyes You are filled with hatred You're absolutely right Hatred is the most serious sickness This sickness takes the most lives Why's that? Because the poison inside you could only take your life But the hatred in you could kill a hundred or say, even a thousand lives You won't understand now One day, when you're fed up with the... endless troubles and grudges in life; Then come back to find me I believe that I will never come back I'm poisoned with the Seven Cold Stars I've only seven days to live Right. Bring the Zombie here Zombie This young man got hit by the Tangs' weapon Head straight to Yanbo Lake right away Look for two people in white Tell them I sent you Yanbo Lake? Ten years as a swordsman How long would a person live on? When one grows old, there's nothing left but regrets I'd ratherjust travel around Excellent verse Yours ain't bad either Who are you? What's the purpose of your visit here? I'm a dying man, but it's not my time yet I still have to avenge my father's death Did we kill your father? No. On the contrary you're my saviours How is that? An old man who lies in a coffin said so Our master? Seven Cold Stars' poison My brother isn't trying to harm you The poison is deadly He's only trying to help you by forcing... the poison out. Look What... have you done? Sorry, I had no idea she's a girl Never mind, it wasn't intentional Drink this up You'll recover in a few days Right I didn't get your names, my saviours The world is already very chaotic Me and my sister don't want to get involved All we desire is to lead a carefree life We don't want to get involved There's no need to repay us And we don't want to know your name Excuse me, I've a pressing matter to attend to Thank you and good bye Please What do you want to buy, mister? Beef, herbs, sugar- four taels of each Please come inside Please Boss... What's the urgency? What happened? Master Tang Yu is here What? Master Tang Yu's here?! Master Tang Yu Liu Sangeng, you three are still alive Master Tang Yu We could have killed Zhao Wuji But we met the Red kid, apprentice of the Unique Man on the Carriage, that's why... You're afraid of that Red lad, but not our rules? Don't get me wrong But he got poisoned by our Seven Cold Stars I believe... Quiet! Don't you know that he's on the road again? And he'll pass through this town tomorrow What? He's not dead? That's right, he's alive Therefore you three must die. The wine Don't bother to run I won't poison the wine Because I've smeared the poison on the cups Once you've picked them up you'll die of poisoning Go ahead, Tang Yu I won't blame you for killing me What? Have you done something wrong? I know nothing about that Sometimes I'm very forgetful I don't remember things very well Listen up When Zhao Wuji passes through tomorrow Kill him at the Lion's Jungle Restaurant I've been there. There's only one entrance Plenty of exits though Place our men... at every exit They'd all pretend to be patrons Once he comes in Make sure only the center table is vacant Place a net above the table Master Zhao, we meet again Don't hurt people on your side Who are they? My four brothers What are you doing here? You see, when I owe a favor... I always try to return it Who told you to save me? Um... he did Dugu Sheng... Who are you? His cousin, Dugu Hong Tang Yu... You killed so many of our men? It was in order to gain Zhao Wuji's trust Waiter... Coming We've to leave soon Is the food ready? Yes, I'll bring it in Is this horse for us? Yes Sir, the dishes are ready Leave them here Is the guest next door up? Yes He's gone out to buy something Could you tell him... to come here to eat when he returns? Sure He could start on the rice first Or the dishes Or have a glass of water Even he is in a rush He'd have gone for the horse He'd die an even more tragic death if he rides What do you think? I've got it all figured, haven't I? Waiter... Yes? Give us the bill Sure... Then I'll buy a coffin You've got everything? Have a bite before we leave No, I don't have time What's the rush? No, we're not leaving today That's right We don't need the horse anymore Why aren't we leaving? Because tonight... A man called 'God of Wealth' will hand me... a very important list What list? The list has all the names... of our spies in Tangs' base camp It's still early We should eat first I've had some, it's no good Let's go outside to eat Right, I need a favor from you today What is it? This town is the last leg... of the journey from Dafeng Hall to Tangs' base Our branch is inside the Xiecheng Grocers We have 2 branch heads, one named Fan Yunshan ...an honest fellow. He's been here for 30 years The other's called Ding Qi; a young man with good skills. He's been stationed here for 3 years One of them is a traitor Because news about Dafeng Hall often leaks at this point I don't want any of the Tangs to find out my whereabouts, and I don't want them to have the list from the 'God of Wealth' Hence I must take out the traitor tonight You know who he is? No, but you can find out for me Why? Because he won't recognize you Tell them you're a messenger... from the Dafeng Headquarters Talk to them inside Inform them about the God of Wealth's visit What can I do for you, mister? I'm not here to buy things Then why would you be here? The great wind brought me Any news from the headquarters? God of Wealth' will be here at the temple Leave when you're done If one of them happens to be the traitor... He will go and spread the news We'll wait on the roof opposite them And we can kill him right away So he's the one Fan Yunshan, is it time? Yes Look Where are you from? The great wind brought me Got the list? Yes, but these two... They're our people Fan Yunshan, chief of the local branch The other is my life saver You are wrong indeed I'm not your life saver But your killer Who are you? Tang Yu Fan Yunshan, you... Zhao Wuji, you killed the wrong man today After I had met Master Tang Yu... I knew something went wrong I sent Ding Qi to spread the news You got tricked So you're the traitor That's right, he's been... working with us for about ten years What else do you want to know? Nothing Then... you can die Not yet, I want to look... at your expression when you read the list Tang Yu, you're besieged. Zhao Wuji Who's he? A dead man A switchblade and a little blood How do you know he's not the traitor? You said it yourself The real traitor will recognize the Tangs Why would he be here then? Since when did you know I'm Tang Yu? From very beginning You know, if you were Dugu Hong... You'd only kill Liu Sangeng You killed Qiao Wen for only one reason To destroy the witness Since you became my travel companion I've had a peaceful trip That's because you're Tang Yu Then the Tangs won't hassle me anymore Then why wait so long? I need you to find out who's the traitor Zhao Wuji, you aren't dumb I mean, actually you're quite smart And I'd say you're over smart You underestimated the others Tang Yu, where are you going? I can go anywhere I please I'm impressed Thanks So, got another sword? Of course I knew you had another sword But I didn't expect there'd be something inside the rod It's useless even if you have another sword I have run out of swords But I've got a bomb Tang Yu was really something Young chief, you'll pose as Tang Yu's friend and deliver his coffin to their base You aren't worried that they'll find out? I've taken care of... traitor Fan Yunshan and his men At their base now, I believe... there's no one who knows my identity Buddy Tan Zhang, long time no see Come, let's have a drink The wine How far is it from the Tangs' Base? It's a two days journey Are you looking for someone there? No, just delivering a friend's coffin Enjoy your food Please have a seat inside... It's quieter Such bad luck The sight of a coffin in the morning ...right in the middle of the road! Whose coffin is this? Damn... What would you like to order? I'm starving, make this quick A chicken, some white meat and wine Hurry... l'm starving Sure Hurry Whose coffin is this? Mine I want this Why's that? It's the corpse which I'm interested in Lying inside That's the body of Tang Yu... who took 78 lives of our Thunderbolt Clan How do you know it's Tang Yu? A garment merchant told me What do you plan to do? Take it away? I'll kill you first Come on Who are you? I'm... just me I'm a scholar, not a merchant You don't believe me? Allow me Who killed them? I did Damn... Coffin and a bunch of thieves... And who are you? I belong to the Tang Clan I'm here to receive you and Master Tang Yu's coffin Please wait here I heard you brought Master Tang Yu's body here Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm Tang Yu's friend Delivering his body Where are the other masters? It's very comfortable lying inside Have you no idea whom I am? I don't know My name is Tang Chueh C-h-u-e-h? That's right I've heard that... you're the most vicious of the Tang brothers That's right Didn't you see me... kill with chopsticks? I did yesterday Great Then why don't you ask me... how did Tang Yu die? Who killed him? He's dead anyway It doesn't matter anymore However the most important thing now is... Are you really his friend? Of course I'm, who else could I be? Not a friend, but his enemy! The worst kind of enemy... is a spy So when will you check me out? Now What did you do that for? Now that you can't move If I find out you're lying... It would be easier to kill you Name? Li Zhongtang Home town? Xitou village, Wannan state, 100 miles away That's far. Name of your parents? Li Yunzhou; Deng is mother's maiden name Tang She Here Check it out right away Yes, master Tang Chueh Mr. Shangguan is here What is it? I heard Master Tang Yu is murdered Who's the murderer? We don't know yet Who is he? Tang Yu's friend Why didn't he turn his face over? Is he afraid I might recognize him? No, I've numbed his acupuncture points Therefore he can't move now I heard that Zhao Wuji... has left Dafeng Hall We must be on our guard Don't worry, even if he can sneak in... I assure you he won't be able to walk out Goodbye Please Release him Yes, master Presently we're investigating your background Before we receive a report on that... I will neither trust you nor kill you Stay in the guest room for now The report on Li Yutang's background... will arrive in three days Get your work done and get out. Xishi Halt, who is it? Freeze... Hurry... over there... get him Where? At the front Hold it there That way, search... That way Search over there Go over there Thanks for your help Don't move So it's Master Tang Chueh Please knock next time I didn't want to kill you by mistake I don't wish to die today either I want someone else dead There was an intruder last night Who? Zhao Wuji He is Zhao Wuji True, we do have a large premises here But we do keep a track of those... who are residing with us There were only two names yesterday; You and him If you're not the spy Then he is Do you remember what I said? If in doubt, take him out Didn't you say that, for 100,000 taels of silver you could kill someone? Here're the silver ingots Do away with him It's not that easy to kill me Since I've got captured I will kill myself Not yet Why? Because you'd be more useful alive And you're not the real Zhao Wuji Tang She Here Tell him who he really is Yes sir Ding Qi, twenty eight years old Branch chief of Dafeng Hall You arrived last night Stayed at the Fulai Inn Motive... Not sure yet It couldn't be simpler The real Zhao Wuji's here In order to cover for him He claims to be Zhao Wuji I give a damn if or not he's the real Zhao Wuji But what I want to find out is... whether you're a member of Dafeng Hall So you can kill him for me now Get to it Don't think about killing me You won't be able to do it Or else I'll give away your identity Who is he? He... Speak up He... is Zhao Wuji You double-crossed me? Xishi asked me to What? Leave I can't Take care of yourself, young chief Stop it Now I finally know who you are Who am I? You aren't the real Zhao Wuji This foolish kid thinks that I'll be fooled You're a loyal member of Dafeng Hall You wouldn't be shameless enough to betray Zhao Presently you're desperate yourself... trying to find a scapegoat Who is he? I don't know I mean just because you said he's Zhao Wuji... he needn't necessarily be the real Zhao Wuji Carry it outside Yes If it wasn't owing to his dexterity You could be dead instead Who are you? Li Zhongtang from Xitou village Master Tang Chueh The carrier pigeon is back with the report Give it to me Yes If I read that... there's no such person in Xitou village I'll kill you right away Take a look (There's this person in Xitou, all checked out) Now I trust you're Tang Yu's friend However it's strange, you know Why haven't I met you before? Brother Chueh, I've met him before Brother Ao, sister Yu Yes, brother You are siblings? You knew each other? We've met once at Yanbo Lake You could never have guessed that... I was a member of the Tang family, right? You don't seem related to them Me and my brother Ao don't like our brother Chueh's character That's why we travel most of the time And stay away from home You're really called Li Zhongtang? You don't believe me? I don't believe that you're my brother Yu's friend Why not? Because I know his mannerisms He's selfish, wicked He could never have a friend like you Please tell me the truth What's that? Are you here to avenge for your father? Your father's killer is a Tang? No You swear? I swear But I'll always remember that... I was saved by two Tangs Now I'm relieved I was afraid as to what grudge could we have! Do you believe in ...destiny? Everafter I met you I knew that I'd see you again some day Who's he? Shangguan Ren, traitor of Dafeng Hall Hold it there I've been waiting for you How did you know that I'm here? Since the day you arrived I have known Why then, didn't you kill me earlier? I had to wait for you to come looking for me Don't forget You cut off my father's head Because of his head You can't kill me I saved you at the garden last night So that was you And the background report If I didn't change it There's no such person called Li Zhongtang in Yangliu village So in fact you are my life saver But you killed my father Today I have to kill you But before that You seem to forget something What's that? Jade tiger What do you mean? Do you remember about a... confidential document at our Hall? Written by my father It's our top secret There's one inside the Jade Tiger Go take a look Your Uncle Shangguan is under orders to work undercover at the Tangs' base; it's a secret mission After you've read this, protect him at all costs. Don't hurt him You must listen to his instructions Your father, Jian A secret mission? For the past ten years The Tangs are making poisonous weapons threatening martial arts world. As the head of Dafeng Hall, your father thought of a plan He told me to work undercover here... to investigate their weapons factory Then we can work together from inside, and outside. I mean, wipe them all out Your father sacrificed himself for my sake... to gain the Tangs' absolute trust He cut off his own head Things are very scary What seems right could be wrong I thought you were my father's killer And now I must protect you Wuji, don't worry so much Hereafter you've got to accomplish a lot First of all now, like me... you must gain their trust Will I able to? Of course you can You can propose to Miss Tang Beg your pardon? The master is marrying the young Miss Tang? That's right At their base Our people told me the news Where are you going, lady? Hey Miss, where are you off to? I've got to find Wuji Mr. Sikong is now in liaison with... the other clans for strategies You should wait for his return first No, I must go now Lady... Who is going to accompany you? Me... I'll come along You're back I've checked around We're very close to Tangs' base We must be more careful from this point on Ladies, here come your meals Who ordered this? Wasn't it you? I didn't It's weird! Someone from the kitchen... said that you ordered the dishes Qianqian, do you think your brother means to do it? I think he has his reasons Usually he isn't like this Oh no... What... We just ate the dishes The dishes These were supposed to be for you The boss said we shouldn't waste it, that's why... The Tangs' Poisonous Pin Did you eat the fish? A little bit... I... Qianqian, these were meant for us Then they know that we're already here We should leave right away Hold on Qianqian Miss Zhao, recognize me? When your brother got married... I was at your house with a gift Tang She That's right You came all the way here Whom do you wish to see? My master Tang Chueh has been wondering... whether Zhao Wuji's really dead I assume that, the reason you're here... is to look for Zhao Wuji? You... Qianqian You numbed her acupuncture point? This girl would be good in bed Where's Zhao Wuji? I know I know where he is Zhao Zhong You are from the Zhao family? That's right, I grew up there I'm a loyal servant Then why did you betray them? Didn't you say it yourself a while back? This girl would be good in bed Zhao Zhong, you... I was only a servant before But now... That's why you gave up Zhao Wuji for her So many men have done all kinds of... dirty jobs for women Where's Zhao Wuji? At the Tangs' Base Then why do you think I should believe you? Then how can I make you believe me? You see, it's only a two day journey to the base This poison will take effect in three days If you lie... You won't live after you drink this Don't even think of moving! I have got your vital acupuncture points Just let me have a go Help... You are in such a rush Well, she'll be mine sooner or later Why take it so seriously? Fine, I apologize Come on, let's have a drink. Cheers... Why don't you drink? Afraid it's been poisoned, is it? I drank it too Because of the cup? Use mine Come on, use mine I raise this toast as a respect for you That's more like it Miss Zhao You'd have never thought When you were touching me You released my sinus Qianqian, what are you doing? I don't care about my safety I'd have to kill this ungrateful dog Qianqian, you're wrong. He's here to save us Earlier, in the room... He was trying to release you Stop it I made a diversion earlier My lady has already poisoned the wine You drank it too I've told you I'm a loyal servant Zhao Zhong... My father told me to follow you... so that we could return home and think of a plan Then when I got here... I saw there're so many of them I knew we couldn't fight them directly I'm sorry to have offended you, Miss Zhao Accept my apologies Don't, Zhao Zhong Zhao Zhong Lady, you're a good human being Inform the chief of my death when you see him Tell him not to disappoint you or Dafeng Hall Or else I'd go on haunting him in spirit Zhao Zhong Groom and bride will now worship heaven and earth Who are you? Wuji Who are you? Zhao Qianqian, Zhao Wuji's sister What are you doing here? It's Miss Tang's wedding day I just desire to know who the groom is Why the curiosity about the groom? I heard the groom is Zhao Wuji of Dafeng Hall So do you see him now? Yes, he's the unfilial, unfaithful... heartless, & unrighteous Zhao Wuji Go over to him, sister-in-law Take a good look at your husband At first I couldn't imagine you'd remarry... But now... Lady, is there something wrong with you? I have never seen you in my life Besides, I had no wife Get out of here at once if you're smart Or you'll end up dead here What... did you say? I said that I've never seen you in my life I had no wife What are you doing? I'll kill you, you traitor Who says I have betrayed? You've always aspired wealth and social position, that's why you've defected to the Tangs Even though being in your wedding costume today, you've refused to recognize your wife and sister Wait, you got me confused here Is he Zhao Wuji or Li Zhongtang? Of course I'm Li Zhongtang They must have got paid to come here... and ruin my wedding day Kick them out Hold on What's the point? Since you're not Zhao Wuji Might as well just kill them Isn't that a better idea? There's no need to kill on such a happy day This can't be any easier I know them I'm sure they know me Of course You cut off my father's head You're the traitor, Shangguan Ren You better don't do anything here I want to ask you If he's the real Zhao Wuji Why is he here at the Tangs' Base? To kill you and avenge our father's death It can't be any simpler? If he kills me, he's Zhao Wuji If not, he's Li Zhongtang I'm no Zhao Wuji Why would I want to kill you? Now we've got it clarified You're indeed Li Zhongtang But I've once heard that... for 100,000 taels of silver, you could kill anyone Now I'm giving you the money Kill Zhao Wuji's wife now You can't, young master You can't do it My son said that if you... disappoint the young lady, He'll haunt you as a ghost Let's go back Mr. Sikong is now in liaison with the other clans, seeking an alliance We could get our revenge very soon Silence You old fool, full of nonsense I don't know what you're talking about Get out... now! I've served the old chief all my life I watched you grow up You can't betray the Dafeng Hall Get out... Oh come on, I don't care about... the problems at your Dafeng Hall Today's my sister's wedding day I don't want to kill anyone Just leave, okay Hold on... One more thing 100,000 taels of silver in reward; kill her I shouldn't be here today, Zhao Wuji But my appearance here today might have a bad effect on your brilliant future But I don't regret it Now I know the real you You're not human Don't come any closer I'll die But... I'll die under his sword I want him to regret all his life Sister-in-law I've heard this river leads straight back home You two go on ahead After I've completed my mission... I'll offer my proper respects I'm grateful for your love, my dear wife We'll be together again in our next lives Your lonely grave a thousand miles away Each year brings sorrow under the moonlight I like these verses the best... in Su Dongpo's Jiang Chengzi poem Who are these for? Your wife? Your friend? So you've found out everything? No matter for whom When your wife and friend die... in front of you, it's quite a shock Because you're only human I can tell Enmity between Tangs and the Zhaos... has been going on for over a hundred years Many were killed in the past, at present and probably in the future too I won't kill you today because my sister is in love with you And there's been too much bloodshed Go back, Zhao Wuji Before you get to kill any of us And before I draw my sword Go back I don't know if or not you're my match But I really don't wish to kill you If yesterday's wrongs are avenged today Today's wrongs will be avenged tomorrow What about tomorrow's?! Zhao Wuji, there're two types of Tangs One kind is the idiot He considers if he doesn't kill, others won't kill him That's my brother Tang Ao Then there's me I'll kill first, no matter what Go Zhao Wuji, where are you running to? You knew too? When you killed your wife... I knew So? Feeling a bit dizzy? How do you know? We are well-known for our poisons Before you came in I smeared the poison on the rod With just one touch... The poison will go through your body You will die a quick death I'm impressed You've lived up to the name after all Earlier I thought you might have had reservations Of course not Only one of us will live What a woman hates most... is being deceived by a man Zhao Wuji, you'd never have imagined that you would die at a girl's hands? Tang Yu, you seem so sweet-natured So you're the most wicked one Then you've learnt your lesson Those who seem harmless... can indeed be most destructive! Because you weren't aware Then what about Shangguan Ren? I'll kill him when he would least expect it Hurry with the bodies, go Go Oh, I thought I was dead! I used a special type of fragrance which my master gave me lt'd make one's heart stop temporarily You'll be alright with the antidote You didn't mean to kill me If I wanted to, I could have... done it in the living room You better hurry Do you know... why I'm here? Of course. Shangguan Ren is your undercover You want to wipe us out However let me tell you something With both of you... You can't even take out Tang Chueh And we've got my brother Tang Ao Zhao Wuji, before our love wasn't stained by blood You owe me love But when you've killed any of us You'll owe me hate Hatred is often paid off with bloodshed At that time You wouldn't know what to do Never mind I know you didn't mean to deceive me After you've gone Remember that you let me down Why are you here, Shangguan? Xishi sent me a message saying... Tang Chueh has found out about our plan And he plans to kill us That's why Xishi stole Tang's personal seal So that today we can wipe out their factory Then what about the others? They're waiting at my house for Tang Chueh Who are you? Sikong Xiaofeng of Dafeng Hall What are you doing here? We've got everything ready Waiting for you to walk in this trap So? Everything done? Yes Go on Mr. Shangguan Master Tang Chueh's seal Let me in, it's urgent Yes, open the door Yes Alright Gloves Who is it? Urgent, let me in Brother Chueh The net Kill You've got tricked Inside and outside our base it's filled with members of Dafeng Hall Go So? Destroyed everything? Yes Great, head to the hall Go Help them out Go We'll go this way Go I should've known My sister doesn't seem like any of us She couldn't have poisoned you Shut up Today's the end of your clan Looks like... There's only three of us here I'll be the last one standing Watch out, he's got another sword Hold it, both of you I've said that I'll kill you The sword You? Have you heard of Xishi? What? You're Xishi? That's right I'm the undercover But you grew up here Because my father's murdered by you Kill her... hurry Wait Not her Why not? She saved my life Wuji, we've got to root them out We must eliminate all of them But... Tang Yu Don't come any closer Like I said, you only owed me love before But now, you owe me hate You're crazy No, I'm not Crazy are the ones those who fight constantly, getting rid of those with different views They want to uproot us I don't want to kill anyone Uncle Shangguan Break it off This is the downfall of the Tangs You better run Tangs' base has fallen Where can I run to? Never mind It doesn't matter any longer, If I kill one more or two more But you owe me too much Pay it back in my next life Tang Yu... Mr. Shangguan Mr. Sikong is in the hall Go I regret saving you at the lake I regret that I didn't ask your name I won't kill an unarmed man Just a heartless man Why must you kill me, Tang Ao? Because I'm a Tang, and you're a Zhao Looks like only one of us will live You said that... there's been too much bloodshed Why are you forcing me? I don't understand either I saved you once, and now I'm trying to kill you But I didn't want to do either Have you thought that we're both pathetic? We're like pawns We're forced to do things Zhao Wuji, come on Uncle Shangguan Shangguan Ren His swordplay is the best If I didn't stab him in the back The two of us... are no match for him Uncle Shangguan Why must we kill? It's for the sake of the martial arts world There's a rule If you don't kill, you'll get killed Man, I hate rules Tang Ao The Triple Sword was really something Tang Ao I've told you We're all pawns Tang Ao... Who are these for? One's for my wife Another is for my life saver Their surnames were Tang That's why I had to leave them here Wuji, because your father sacrificed himself and you've shown your abilities when we wiped out the Tangs The chieftains of the different clans recommend... you to be the leader of the alliance Dafeng Hall has won in the end Won? Uncle Sikong Have you counted as to whether... we have more casualties or the Tangs? I don't desire to be the alliance head Those I love are all dead Almost most of my friends are dead God forbid, if there're any more battles I'd have no one to sacrifice One day, when you're fed up with the... endless grudges and fights of the world I'm sure you'll be back
