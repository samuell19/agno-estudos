Okay, back off again. Sorry. - Me put it on? - Yeah. You wanna climb on top of him? You wanna kiss each other? Alright, cut. Good. Good, good. Alright, guys. Nice. Yeah. Alright. - You guys OK? - Yeah. - Tired? - Yeah. Face burned? Face burned, a little bit, yeah. Good. Alright, relax. Who needs clothes? That was awesome. That was awesome. Yeah, it looks nice, guys. You need... Okay. Good. Here, disconnect. Or just leave that in here. Is that all we're doing or... Um, well, I'm gonna unload this stuff and take a look at it, and then... I'm just worried that... What? It's OK, it wasn't hard, I just wanna look... Yeah, it looked good. - It did? - Yeah. It's just a super quick close-up all you see is really her hands on it. - OK. - You know what I mean? - You good? - Mhmm. - Nice condom-putting-on. - Thanks. Alright, I'm gonna go unload stuff. You OK? - Yeah. - Yeah? There was a second where you seemed... - Not OK? - Not OK. I think I was surprised by... by how... You know, I don't know... yeah. It was... I felt businesslike, but it's not businesslike... - ... what we're doing. - Mhmm. I mean, I think it was good. - It looks good. - Oh, good. - Yeah. - OK, good. - Alright. - He's so nice. It's just like... strange... I mean, I think it'd would've been easier if it was like, more intimate. But it being such a, like... - .... fast and furious... - Yeah. ... consent stuff. That's actually, I don't even necessarily make out like that. If I'm really into someone, it's... sometimes it's like rough, or it feels not organic. And so, it just felt especially so doing it this way. But, interesting experience. - Have you ever been in a sex scene? - Mhmm. So, how did it feel? Oh, I don't know. It varies from film. Super stressful... It depends on if I'm directing or not. If I'm in somebody else's movie, then... I can usually be a little bit more present at least, and sort of conscious of what's going on. If I'm in, if I'm doing my own stuff... I'm just like really aware of the camera and audio and stuff... and it's way more stressful. Or my brain's at least divided in different places that aren't necessarily focused on, just acting and stuff. - Really? - Mhmm. In what categories? Well like of... trying to be authentic and into that moment. And then also, trying to... Well, I guess it's just like seeing, being... feeling the objective and subjective, or... I guess feeling like I'm present even though I'm trying really hard not to think about the fact that you guys are there... I can almost see us as a sort of, party... so it's weird. Mhmm. OK, I gotta go unload footage. You whole dress safety-pinned together? Yeah, pretty much. It's way too big. We got it at a thrift store. So... that one's an extra safety pin. - I can't see all... here, turn around. - This one's a little dirty. That's the back. I kind of hide them on the side... normally. This was fun. Good. Are you trying? Yeah, I'm trying... just, I can't remember. I wish I kept it, cause it was so... it was hilarious. Holy shit. It's just getting worse. Don't. Oh no. That was erotic. I don't know. What is that? Your balls? You still remember it. Well, I remember it like started off... I was like, "Yeah, it looks really good." And then I got to her. I got on top of him, you can see part of his penis. I got to her face. And I was trying to draw her, like... OK wait, I was trying to draw her... like, passion,like in heat. And then it came out like that. Oh my god. That was the scariest thing I ever saw. - It also looks like his penis is... - Did you draw her spine? ... destroying her ass. - It looks like his penis is going straight through her. - Why did you draw her spine? No, it's her vagina. Her ass is on top. It kind of looks like a crucifix, really, when you look at it. Oh my gosh, that's exactly it. Biblical implications to this somewhere. - Why is she like this? - No, that's his arms. - She's got her arms on his... - Oh... So, where's his head then? - You can't see it. - Why did you draw her whole spine? I don't know, to show it's the back, I guess? - Is that her tongue sticking out? - Yeah. She's supposed to be like... Wait, who's the stand-up comic? - You, yeah. - Me? Why? Cause they have smelly pussies? Yeah. Every one of them. - Chris Rock, smelly pussy. - Alright, great. I'm rolling. OK. You know, cause if you think your pussy doesn't smell... Alright, sorry. So wait, we're playing with her nipple? - Yes. - Nipple playing. Thanks. Wait, put your... yeah. Now move your hand... towards her hair, yeah. Where did you get those blue eyes? - They're blue? - They look blue. - Are they not? - They change. Sometimes they're green. I got them at uh, Sears. Keep going, guys. Sorry. - Just keep talking. - OK. I used to draw um... you know The Beatles, uh... you know The Beatles... - Mhmm. - Revolver album? It's like a drawing of their like... Wait, hold on. Do that over again. - Talk about... - Yeah, yeah. Sorry. - Go straight into it. - OK. I never dated anyone like you before. What do you mean? Like, gentle and... kind. Um, let's... let's... I'm gonna keep rolling, but just have... The way you're saying, "I've never dated anybody like you," feels a little... like you're saying you're dating him but really, you guys just met last night. So, let's phrase that in a way where it's less... "I never went out," OK, or something... Or you can say, like... "it's interesting to meet you... none of my ex-boyfriends..." Yeah, yeah. OK. How about, "I've never been a lover... "I've never met a lover like you"? "I've never had an orgasm with someone as..." - kind..." - "I've never had dope with someone like you."? Can you get a little closer... Yeah. Is this bad over here? Yeah, yeah. Totally. It's just a little... Alright. Go ahead. From the top. I never went out with anyone like you before. Wait, let's say that again, let's... uh... - I don't know what I'm looking for... - Louder? "I've never...!" Use my stage voice. - "I've never been with someone like you..." - "I've never..." OK. - Yeah... - That feel better? - Yeah, that's better. - OK. I'm still rolling. I've never been with anybody like you before. What do you mean? What am I like? Kind. Gentle. Thoughtful. Fucking great in bed. Who were you even dating? - Sound like a bunch of... jerks. - Assholes. I think I'm attracted to that kind of person. What kind of person are you attracted to? Pretty people. You know, all the usuals. But, do you date mean people or nice people? I dated a crazy woman once. Run your hand through his hair. We used to fight all the time. I thought I was crazy too. Why did you think you were crazy? Because we were fighting all the time and... One day we were fighting, and I just thought... I suddenly thought my neighbors could hear us and then, I was like so then I was listening to everything that I was saying and analyzing it, and it all sounded nuts. Like, we would just have stupid arguments and like... - talk in circles. - Hmm. That's so... actually my biggest fights were not with lovers, but with a really good friend, but when a third party was in the room it was always a million times worse cause when you fight, and someone else is witnessing you don't listen, and you have to win. Yeah. So, it's much harder to... do the work of being a good communicator when you're with... in that situation. We went to couples counseling and... How did that go? I loved it. He was great. He was like... I was like, "nothing ever comes out of our fights." He was like, "No, cause you're not..." "You're trying to win. You're trying to win the fight." "You're trying to win the argument. You're not trying to..." You're not trying to like, make things better. And I was like, "Yeah." So then he was like, "So, if you get mad..." "you should go for a walk, and then calm down" "and then talk about it when you're not mad." So then, the first time we started fighting after that I was like, "Well, I'm gonna go for a walk." And she was like, "You always walk away." But, did she you know that you were trying to... the situation? Did she know that you were trying to... help the, like make the... that you were trying to... bring you guys together? I dunno. I was like, "Larry told..." She was like, "Larry. You just listen to Larry." - Oh my god. Really? - Yeah. Wow. That does sound kind of like a bad relationship. Yeah. But when we broke up I got really depressed, cause I was like all of sudden I was really bored like suddenly there wasn't a big crisis everyday. Oh, interesting. - Then you have to focus on your problems and your real life. - Yeah. And then you realize that you have problems in your real life - and it wasn't just her. - Yeah. - I hate that feeling. - Yeah. - So much easier to blame somebody else. - I know. I was like, "If it wasn't for her, this relationship would be amazing." OK, no more talking. Just rub, like rub, yeah. Her breast, rub down her side. OK. And then, just sort of kiss a little bit, yeah. Rub your hand through her hair. Rub your hand down her back. Can you bring the sheet down. Lay down next to him and then roll over on top. - Like that one more time. - OK. Just keep going. Alright, great. Good. Alright, guys. Thank you. So, that's it for in here? Yeah. That's it until tonight. I think. I'm gonna go home with the stuff and check it out. I don't know if you heard that plane going over or... it was about... Really? It may not be... It wasn't very loud. Alright. You guys need anything? - Glass of water. - Yeah. - Yeah, thanks. - Sure. - You OK? - Mhmm. Sorry if I... with my hand. - No, it was fine. - You sure? - Yeah. - OK. It's so hard to like... - Stop the physical urges? - Well, I want it to be natural. Yeah. Like, that's what I would normally do, so... Thanks, man. - You OK? - Mhmm. Oh, thanks. - I thought it was good. - Huh? - I thought it was good. - Yeah? Yeah. Was that really true? Yeah. But, I mean... we were both nuts. I don't know. I mean... We just a hard time communicating. Then we just started having these fights. And we were never on the same page. Like she'd be in a good mood and I'd be in a bad mood. You seem like a very good communicator. I think cause I went through all that, I think I'm better now. Like, now when I date someone, and they start acting like that I'm like... Sorry guys. I think I left something in here. We're just gonna keep acting, even though you guys aren't rolling. Is that OK? Just like, method. - Where the fuck did that go? - What are you looking for? Lens cap. - Uh, I think I saw... - It's fine. I think I saw... you had it in your hand. Yeah like, everything that you're saying how much of it is from your real life - and how much of it is... - Everything. Really? Yeah, it's so much easier to talk about. But, then I feel bad. I feel like, well... I'm like exposing all these.... yeah. This is a lot easier that I thought it was going to be. I was like really scared. Today feels much better than yesterday. Yeah. Your body feels really nice too. Like... - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, you're so soft. - You're so soft. I'm pretty soft for a guy. - I guess. - Yeah. You feel like porcelain. So nice. Your lips. Your lips are so soft. I was gonna kiss you! Sorry. - Confusing. - I know. I'm gonna keep rolling, but just have... The way you're saying, "I never dated anybody like you." feels a little... Yeah. I think I'm attracted to that kind of person. Oh, hold on. Why'd you think you were crazy? Cause we were fighting all the time. I like the way that you look at me, and the way you touch me. Makes me feel really beautiful. Do you feel beautiful? - Huh? - Do you feel beautiful? You are beautiful. You have amazing eyes. - And the thickest hair around. - Oh yeah? You have a great body. Even though you keep saying otherwise. Run you hand through her hair. It's a little hot. I don't know. I can't tell if it's... Oh, alright. Good. Rub your hand down her back. Can you bring the sheet down. Looks great. Well, this is good. Turn the volume up a bit. That looks awesome. Yeah. Lay down next to him and roll over on top. Where did you get those blue eyes? Are they blue? They look blue. They change. Sometimes they're green. I think I'm attracted to that kind of person. What kind of person are you attracted to? Pretty people. You know, all the usuals. But, do you date mean people or nice... We used to fight all the time. I thought I was crazy too. Why'd you think you were crazy? Cause we were fighting all the time and... One day we were fighting, and I just thought... I suddenly thought my neighbors could hear us and then I was like so then I was listening to everything that I was saying and analyzing it, and it all sounded nuts. Like, we would just have stupid arguments and like... - talk in circles. - Hmm. That's so... actually my biggest fights were not with lovers, but with a really good friend, but when a third party was in the room it was always a million times worse cause when you fight, and someone else is witnessing you don't listen, and you have to win. Yeah. So... Lay down next to him and roll over on top. Like that one more time. Just keep going. Alright, great. Good. Um... Where is she? Did she leave, or... No, I don't think so. Oh my god. Just, it felt so good. Like, I... cause I'm like... You've probably never experiences this, but I'm like older, so... penis doesn't really get - gets hard as it used to. - OK. And, I mean it gets... I'm not having dysfunction, but.... It just felt like... I thought I was like seventeen really hard, I was like... Ah, it just felt great. - Is this weird, that I'm talking about... - No. But, now it's gonna be so weird to do... a sex scene, like do you know what I mean? Is it gonna... That's what I'm worried about. Is it? - Or is it gonna be better? - I dunno. We'll find out. Yeah, man. Thank you for... asking to use me. I still don't know why you want me to do it, but... I'm the engine, he's the caboose. - I'm not the... - Oh yeah? I guess it's cause Bill's got a great dingo and... Please, just drink a beer while... Yeah, wait a minute. - This is a pimping school. - Oh, here's our caboose. - Get in the back. - Yeah, working too hard. Gimme the poundy kind. Yeah. You didn't even have to ask. I was going for it.
