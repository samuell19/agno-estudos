I ain't disappointing shit. Maybe not. There's going to be a lot of deejays there, right? - Yeah. - So, how do they pick who goes when? There's 40 deejays, 20 sets... All I know is I go seventh. See, 'cause we're going to need an alibi. Since you're going seventh, that'll give us an opportunity to go in, do what we gotta do, and jet. Get the fuck out of there. I think that'll work. - What about the cops, man? - Bishop checked it out. There's two overlapping patrols about three minutes apart. So, we just gotta be fast. Yo, I think we should plan this another time. This nigga's scared! Ain't nobody scared. I just told you I had to deejay Saturday night. Fuck that shit! We're goin' Saturday night, and that's it. - I'll hold on to the gun. - Why should he hold on to the gun? 'Cause I already got it, motherfucker! Just let him hold the gun.

If anybody asks about Raheem, we don't know. We ain't seen him. You can't fucking keep up with a man at a party. So... Come on. Come on! Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Let's go. Good luck. Fuck that, you are brothers. Piece of cake, Q. Round 2! Once again, we have DJ, that fly guy, Gee-Q! And from Detroit, DJ Plaz! Hey! Hey! Get down here, you! Get down here! Shut up! Keep your mouth shut! Raheem is dead. Somebody shot him. Hey, just sit back and be cool. I'm Detective Markham. This is Detective Kelly. We want to ask you boys some questions. Will you come here, please? Let's go. Let's open it up right now! Break away! Move it! When was the last time you saw Raheem Porter breathin'? - Tonight at the club. - What time? About a hour or two before Q set up. Where did he go after you last saw him? - I have no idea... - Why do you think he left the club? I don't know. I thought he was checkin' out. So, he was talking to a girl, clockin' the hos. - Clockin' the hos? - Clockin' the hos? I'll ask you again, did you leave the club at any time tonight? - I went to the basement for a little while. - What for? I ran into an old girlfriend. So, what were you doing down in the basement? - Do you know Fernando Quiles? - Yes. We know you got popped for boostin' in Quiles' store last June! Yes or no? - Well, I... - Yes or no? Yes. Look, we know that Mr. Quiles was regularly harassed by local gangs. Do you boys have any rivalry with the other gangs? Puerto Rican gang, Rapido Muerte. Yeah. We know who they are. Radames. They always fucking with us. - Radames? - Tell us about Radames. Puerto Rican gang. They think they rule the fucking world. Isn't it true that your gang regularly harassed Mr. Quiles? No. 'Cause we're not a gang. - Yeah. We didn't kill him, though. - We didn't say you killed him! We said that you regularly harassed Mr. Quiles! That's what we said. How about Porter? Did they harass him, too? If anybody had a motive to do Raheem in, it would have been Radames. Q got loud on you. They screamed on you. That's why. We just want to get the full confession. We want to get the story from you, this way we can protect you. So we know what's happening. Look, when it goes down, I can talk to the DA. And everything's going to be cool. - I didn't do nothing. - You won't get much time. They say that you was the cat that blew Raheem away. Now, who the fuck killed Porter? Who killed him? Talk to me! I don't know, man! I don't know. Why do you seem so nervous? What are you nervous about? 'Cause we're three niggas in a police station. It doesn't matter what happened. If y'all want us to be guilty, we'll be guilty. If you didn't do nothing, then you got nothing to worry about. Quincy, please eat something. - I don't feel like eating right now, Ma. - I know, but just try, okay? Just try for me. Come on. Okay. Yo, man. I'm scared. You scared? You don't have to be doing all this. I wish you would go sit down. - I got this, Myra. - I know, but I can take care of this. Be with the people. It's okay. - I'm okay. - How you doing, Mrs. Porter? - I'm fine, Eric. - Hey, Steel. Help me. Bring in the corn bread. - This one? - Yes. - What's up, Myra? - Q! I haven't seen you in a long time. Yeah. Sorry it had to be like this. How you doing? Under the circumstances, I'm all right. I feel like I gotta stay strong for Ma, though. She's trying to deal with this by keeping busy, and she just keeps going and going nonstop. And I just don't think she's even cried yet or... Hey, Roland. How you doing? I should be asking you that. We're staying strong. I'd feel better if I knew the police had somebody, though, you know? They say there was no witnesses, and they don't have any leads or... I don't know. We been askin' around, too. Nobody's seemed to have seen or heard anything. Find those motherfuckers and the police don't have to do shit. Eric, put them here. - Myra? - Yes, Ma. I've got to take care of that. Excuse me. You remember me, Mrs. Porter? Roland Bishop? Yes, Roland. Thanks for coming. You don't have to thank me for that. Raheem was one of my best friends. It's really nice to see people come together like this when something bad happens, you know? I mean, personally, for me, though, Raheem was like my brother. I mean, he was more than a brother. I mean, we did everything together, just kickin' it every day. If there's anything I can do, just let me know. Who is it? - Hey, Q. - Come on in, man. I heard about Raheem. I really liked Raheem. He's always nice to me. Did somebody shoot him? Yeah. - Do you know who shot him? - Nah, man. Heard you got arrested. What? Where'd you hear that? - From Ishmal. - Who? Ishmal, from the second floor. And Wendy, Clarence, and Rashid. No, man. I ain't get arrested. Hey, Q! Shut up! Yo, Q! Hey, Q! Where is he? Motherfucker, you hurt my arm. - What'd you call me? - You heard me! See, I told you about that word, all right? You gotta learn not to use that bad language, man. Come on, man, seriously, though. - Yo, B, man, do me a favor, all right? - What? If Bishop calls or if he comes by, tell him I ain't here. Why? Don't you like Bishop anymore? - Why you ask so many questions? - 'Cause I like Bishop! - Why? - 'Cause he's cool. He's cool, huh? Well, you just tell Mr. Cool man, if he calls or if he comes by, that I ain't here. What's in it for me? Man, you get to keep your own teeth, that's what's in it for you. That's no good. On account that I'm losin' my teeth anyway. I can't believe this, man. I'm getting blackmailed by my own baby brother? - I tell you what. You like that radio? - Yeah. - It's dope, right? - Right. - Go ahead. You can have it. It's yours. - Really? - You just do what I tell you. - Fine by me. Go ahead. It's yours. What do you say, man? Thank you. Damn, man. Has it been that long? You want to try that again outside after school, you punk? What's up? I ain't seen you in a couple days. What's been happenin'? Man, get off that shit. It's over! There ain't nothin' nobody can do about it now. - What do you want from me, man? - Nothin'! Just came to see if you was all right, see how you been doin'. Well, I ain't... I ain't talked to nobody, all right? I know. We crew. Always will be. I just came to see what's up. Let me tell you somethin', B. I'm only playin' your fucking game 'cause there ain't shit else to do. But don't you ever pull a gun on me again in your life! Well, I hope I won't have to. Yeah, we all go down if you do, 'cause we all crew. Just try me if you think I'm bullshittin'! Excuse me. Look at this! The brother finally decides to stand up like a man and throw down. Too bad Raheem had to die first, huh? It's over. Everything starts from now. We all go down unless we stay together. Ain't no one man above the crew. You know that shit. You're crazy, man. You know what? When you said that last time, I was kind of trippin', right? But now, you right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about you, I don't give a fuck about Steel, and I don't give a fuck about Raheem, either. I don't give a fuck about myself. Look, I ain't shit. I ain't never gonna be shit. And you less of a man than me, so soon as I decide that you ain't gonna be shit... So be it. You remember that, motherfucker, 'cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about... partner. Hey, baby, can I get you... - Don't do that! - Sorry. Don't ever scare me like that. You better watch that shit. I said I was sorry. Didn't your mom ever teach you to make yourself known before you enter a fucking room? You watch your mouth in my house, Quincy. Fuck you. I am not one of your high school playmates, and if you cannot respect me in my house, then get out of my house. Go on! Out! Come on, nigga. I got what you need. Well, well, lookee here. Get the fuck out of here! I want to talk to your sorry ass outside. Yo, man. I think Bishop's lost it, man. What else is new, man? I mean seriously, man. He was talkin' some way-out shit last night, about how he got more juice than everybody else on the street, and everybody learn not to fuck with him, or else they end up like Raheem and Quiles. He say that shit in front of people? No, only to me, but he meant it, man. I could see it in his face. Something's gonna happen, man. I can feel it. - Yo! - Get the fuck off me! What's the idea of tellin' the cops I killed Raheem? Look, I ain't tell the cops a damn thing. Don't give me that shit, man. They brought me in for questioning. And they said you said I did it. I didn't tell 'em shit! You got it wrong. Nah, punk, you the one that got it wrong. You've been askin' for an ass-kickin' for a long time. Come on, let's go help. Raheem ain't here to protect you no more. I don't need Raheem or nobody for no fucking punk spic! He's fucking suicidal. Ever see Chinatown? Motherfucker. - I must have missed that! - Shit! Shit. - Yo! - Get him! Get in there! Yo, man, you think he saw us? Yeah. What you think he gonna do? I think we lost 'em. Riverside, motherfucker. I'm here to see Sweets. Excuse me, Sweets? Do I know you? No. I'm here to... Come on, come on. I don't have all night. I need some protection. How much we talkin' about? I got about 25. Damn, baby, you can't get a slingshot for that. - Are you Lorraine Powell's son? - Yes. Tell your mother Jackie said hi. Here. Come on! What'd you do to my machine? - Nothin'. - You fucked up my machine! What the fuck's the matter with him? What do you want? I was thinkin' you might like some company. Well, you thought wrong. Damn. You still here? - Hey! - Yo, man! Damn! - 'Bout time you came home. - What you doin' here, man? I thought we supposed to meet at the pool hall. What happened, man? I thought... Just come on, I need you to help me make this money back, okay? - Yeah. - Just come on. Something wrong with the food? You thinkin' about Raheem? I know who killed him. What? - I know who killed Raheem. - Who? I can't tell you that, Yolanda. - Did you tell the police? - Hell no, I ain't tellin' no police. You're mixed up in it, aren't you? I didn't kill him, if that's what you're thinkin'. Well, what are you gonna do about it? I don't know. You don't know? Excuse me? I thought he was your best friend. Yes? Hold on. It's Steel. What up? Q, man, I'm down here at the pool hall with Bishop, man. What are you still doin' down there, man? I told you about that. He met me in my hallway, man. What was I supposed to do, say no? Just come down here, man. I'm scared as hell. Who is that? - No... No... No... - Who the fuck is this? - Yo, I'm out. - Wait a minute, Q. - What's up? - I'll speak to you later, Yolanda. Q, let me help you. I'll speak to you later, all right? I gotta go. Okay, Q, listen. If you need me, I'll be at the hospital later. Cool. Later. Shit. Yo, man, where we goin'? Just down here. Stop being a punk. It ain't gonna take but a minute. You know, big chops, I really wanted all this to work. But you and Q, you ain't crew no more. See? That's what it's all about. See how scared you are? Don't you get tired of this shit? What the fuck do you want from me? Nothin'. I'm not your common, ordinary kind of guy. I got things that I could show you... Excuse us for a minute. - What's happenin', young blood? - What's up, Trip? Lookin' for that P-funk. - You seen Q around? - Somethin' I can do for you? Watch that nigga, man. He on some shit.

And I try to talk to him. He don't even hear me. He gone. I mean, I can look out for myself... but, man, I don't know what he might do to Steel, the way he been actin' lately. Q my man and everything, but I'll do him in if I have to. Word up. - Who is it? - Hello, Mrs. Thurman, this is Q. I mean, this is Quincy Powell. Is Steel... Is Eric home?
