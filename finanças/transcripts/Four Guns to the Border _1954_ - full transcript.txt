There's nothing in it. It was empty. Well, how did I know it was empty? A feller at the bar told me-- A feller at the bar! Just proves one thing. If you want something done right, do it yourself. Nobody's blaming you. You wanted a stake in a ranch long before I knew you. Why, that was just a joke, Cully. What would I do with a ranch? Same with me. The church in my village has needed a new altar for 70 years. So he can wait. We're riding to Greasy's. My gal in Sonora, she won't wait. Cully. Do we have to take this jackass, Bronco, with us? Who's a jackass? Break 'em up, Dutch. Lolly! Lolly! Wake up. Oh, morning, Pop. I slept like a log. Get to the horses. Keep them quiet. Just some punchers. Pop, think we'll get to Shadow Valley tomorrow? We ought to, Lolly. Got that desert to cross. You getting impatient? It'll be nice to see green fields again, have a real home again. I might even plant some flowers in front of the-- Lolly. Pop! Is that what they taught you in school? To scratch your-- scratch yourself in front of someone? Pop, I'm just not cut out to be a lady. You hear that horse whinny? Yeah. That could be a posse. Let's get them before they get us. Come on. The riders have stopped. Yeah. Drop it. Let me go. Didn't know you ever carried that stuff, Bhumer. Dutch. I heard you was dead. You sure unlearned everything I taught you since you've been away. I told never to pull down on nothing unless you had them in your sight! I did have them in my sights. That gun shoots low. Well, it does for a fact. I traded it off in a Navajo. I've been meaning to sight it in. Looks like you fellows was mighty fortunate. Gents, this is Simon Bhumer. In the old days, he never missed. That's Bronco, Yaqui, and that there is Cully. I take it this is your brat. This is my daughter. I hear you turned farmer. Where are you heading? Shadow Valley. Picked me up a small spread a few years back. You're gonna marry her off to a plow pusher? Well, she sure ain't gonna marry no gunslinger. Let's go. Shadow Valley, hmm. That's Indian country. Not legally, it ain't. Somebody ought to tell the Apaches that. I know. I can read the signs. Well, see you. Yeah. Put the coffee on. Make enough for me to shave with. You have a beautiful family, mamacita. Don't ever walk up behind a man like that, Greasy. You here for a grubstake? Might need your help. Awful close to Cholla, ain't you? You came back to deal with Flannery maybe? You got tired of eating crow? I got tired of eating sand and cold beans. You talked big last time, Greasy. Is it the same deal? You figure you're ready? I am. In that case, I'll ride. Be nice to the customers, unless they're Apaches. Sarsparilla's warm. Yeah. At least it's wet. Meeting will come to order. Cully, tell me. Why do three smart hombres like us tie up with a dumb one like Bronco? We may be taking the Cholla Bank tomorrow. It's been tried three times in the past five years. They got a big graveyard in Cholla. About the biggest this side of Gallup. We all gonna land in one sooner than later. Why are you worried? I just don't wanna get shoved. Big piggybank, Cully? Greasy's checking. Cattlemen's Association makes a deposit once a month. When that happens, it's big. Sounds reasonable. Bank's on a corner. Plain sight of everybody in town, and everybody in town is watching. Even Mrs. Pritchard in that Lady Shop's got a gun. Decoy everybody out of the way and the job's gonna be easy. Gonna kill two birds with one stone, eh? Bank and Flannery? And Flannery. Those crackers got worms, Dutch. Why the Cholla Bank, Cully? Why has it got to be the Cholla Bank? You wanna back out? Say so. I ain't backing out. I can use the money. So can Yaqui, for that matter. Even Bronco has a got a right to-- Hey. What are you gonna do with your share? Didn't I tell you? I figure to go into business here with Greasy. Pop, let's rest a minute. All right. I hope it's cool in Shadow Valley. I remember it green and cool. That's the way it is, isn't it Pop? Yeah. That's the way it is, just like you remember it. Oh, you've been looking at those smokes all day. We haven't seen any Indians. Sometimes, that's when they're the closest. When I was in school, I saw Indians at the Topeka County Fair. Right up close. They don't scare me. They say Indians don't talk much. But give them some smoke and they chatter like women at a church social. You better sew up that blouse. He didn't have to tear it. When I get to Shadow Valley, I'm going to make a new dress. Hoo-hoo. You done it again. Hey fellas, you know something, the gal in this calendar ain't half as pretty as that Bhumer's kid. All right, now. Once more. Dutch, you know what to do. I know what to do. -Bronco? -Yeah, boss. I got it. How much gold you got in here? Three, four hundred, why? If we don't pull it off, we lose the poke, too. You dumb, Dutchman. If we don't pull it off, we don't need the poke. Yaqui? Yeah, boss, I know. Nine. Wonder where Greasy keeps his jug? You'll wait with that stuff until we get below the border. Any objections to sarsaparilla? Every now and again, them smokes start going. Nowadays, it don't mean too much, but they used to. Remember '72? The whole danged country went up in flames. There were lots of smokes then clear from here to Shadow Valley. And I don't like this dang weather. Injun weather. Sounds like we got company. Have some cheese. Oh, excuse me. You like candy? Oh, yes. I like it very much. Thank you so much. You'll spoil her. I was just telling the boys, this is real Indian weather, back in '72... Yeah, I know. That was the year Lolly's mother was-- Since then, it's been just the two of us. She's been to school way back east in Kansas. She's a good kid. She ain't a kid no more. Pop? That's nice, honey. Pretty. I like the blue best. I like the blue best. Do you think there's enough of that stuff to make a dress out of? Wait till Greasy gets back. -He will know. -Yeah. And what beats all is, I lugged that map around in my saddle bag for 10 years before I sold it. He went out and really found gold right where it was marked X on the map. I had supper in town. A couple of dozen Apaches broke loose from the reservation down near the border. Who's here? A fellow named Bhumer and his daughter. This ain't no country to be traipsing around with a female. Deposit's in, bank's loaded. You know, I never did see that feller again. Yeah. Got worms. Oh, I better get the horses in the shed, Pop. Good idea, honey. Wish it would rain. Cool things off. Yeah. Oh, Greasy, Simon Bhumer. -Hi, Greasy. -How-do, Mr. Bhumer. Mr. Bhumer, you and your kid can sleep in back. Might rain. That's fine, Greasy. We had supper. How much we owe you? Two bits. You know-- Oh, Lolly, come here. I want to get a pair of breeches for my girl. Uh, what size? I don't rightly know. Well, you better make them big. She's growing. Yeah. Oh, I think these will do, Pop. Yeah. These are good. Greasy, give it to her. -Me? -Go on, give it to her. Thankee. Go on. Give it to her. What's this? A present from Bronco. I buy her clothes, cowpoke. Now, get this. I know your kind. You slap your brand on anything you can. Now I'm warning you, all of you, stay away from her. Take it easy, old man. Why you dirty pup. He used to be faster than you, Bronc. He still is. Pop, he didn't mean anything-- Get in the back room. Good night. Want a drink? The floor will be better than Greasy's bed. Good night, Lolly. Good night, Pop. Go to sleep. Stop making that noise, everybody else is asleep. Don't be afraid of thunder. I guess I should be more careful who I tangle with. Get back to the store. We're moving out. Now! Next time I see you, be wearing a gun, because I'm gonna kill you. Get up, Bronco. Come on. -Hey. -Get up. What do you want to do? Sleep all day, Dutch? Oh, boy, I was so tired. I don't think I even moved all night. Oh, good morning, boss. Why didn't you move from where you was sleeping? Looks like the roof must've leaked, huh? Greasy, get some coffee on. Supposed the Bhumers want some breakfast? I got some eggs. Bhumers are gone. Gone? You seen which way they went? You see 'em go, Bronc? No, not me. I didn't see 'em. This ain't no day for two people to be out in the desert. How about that coffee? Yeah. Want some breakfast, Lolly? You know, there's lot of fine men, Lolly. You don't want a gunslinger. My mother married one. -Your mother was a good woman. -And I'm not? I didn't mean that, Lolly. -Oh, yes, you did. -Now, you just listen to me. You're not so old that can't finish what I started this morning. Now, you ride ahead of me. Go on there. What do you know about women? Guess nobody knows about women, but I know a lot about men. Time yourself with this, Dutch. We'll be in Cholla at 11:40. Pull up here. Pull up here. You ain't had no breakfast yet. Come on, let's build us a fire and brew some coffee and forget your troubles. There's a lot more to being loved by a man than what you found in that shed. You'll understand it when you get older. You wait and see. Maybe I don't wanna wait. None of us do, child, but we don't have much choice. Come on now, get down, give me your hand. Lolly, where are you going? I'm going back to Cully! Lolly! Oh, Lolly. Here. Guess we'll have to make it on one horse. What do you want? Where's Jim? He's not here. No? Cully, what'd come back for? Thought maybe Jim might like to see me. We could talk over old times. You sure feed him good. Cully, listen to me, leave us alone. Never thought Jim Flannery would let a woman hog-tie him. Nobody's hog-tying Jim. Still teaching school? I'm sorry. Don't you like school teachers, Cully? I don't like anybody telling me what to do. Uh-hmm. Especially a woman. Some woman might even love you, if you'd let her. But that would never do, she might make you throw away that toy and grow into a responsible citizen. Like Jim Flannery? Putting on a badge, running his best friend out of town? Jim Flannery grew up. Cully, don't start anything with Jim again. He'll arrest you. He'll put you in jail. Listen to me, Cully. There'll be trouble. If you go into town, there'll be trouble. Don't do it, Cully. Leave us alone. Cully's in town. I heard Cully's been making his brag clean down in Texas. You got to hand it to him. He's got nerve. Well, Harry, you owe me a beer. Jim, he's back. Cully! He's come back. I'll collect that beer this afternoon. Cully. Cully's in town. -Where is he? -In your office. You stay with Mrs. Pritchard. You ladies better go inside. It's a lot safer. Mrs. Pritchard, what am I gonna do? Your man will know what to do. Come on out, Cully. There's no shooting in this town. Come on out, Cully. You come on in, Jim. I won't hurt you. Put it away, Jim. If I'd wanted to drop you, I'd have done it a long time ago. What do you want? This isn't a social visit. You shouldn't have come back, Cully. I told you not to come back. Well, what's the matter with a little social visit, Jim? A man wanting to gab with his best friend. Go on, gab. Remember when we first rode into this town, Jim? Fresh out of the pokey. Shooting up everything in sight. That was something, huh, Jim? Half the town was scared to death. Hiding under their beds. Then Maggie coming out begging us to stop. We stopped all right, huh, Jim? Who wouldn't for a beautiful thing like Maggie? Shut up! What are you trying to make me do, Cully? Put a bullet through you? That's funny. Maggie, a little while ago, was afraid it'd be the other way around. You had the crawling nerve to go to my house? To bother my wife? I can remember the time when she didn't call it bothering. Cully! Don't worry, Maggie. Shooting's too easy. First, I'm gonna push his face in the mud at Swede Larson's stable yard. I'm gonna let you see what your pretty boy looks like with his face all covered with mud. He's crazy, Jim. Don't listen to him. You're the sheriff. Arrest him. Throw him in jail. No, Maggie. What I'm gonna do, I should have done a long time ago. This won't take much time. Let's go. Anything goes? Anything goes. That Cully. He came from such a decent family. I still say if they hadn't died he'd have turned out differently. Jim's changed. Jim had you. Cashier? I'd like to cash that in. I'll weight it. May I have some water for my friend? We would not like to use our guns, too much noise. Go get it, Bronc. Can I borrow your keys. The man asked for the keys, se?or. Thank you. Let me through. If this goes any further, I'm leaving this town, I'm leaving you. It's gotta be finished, Maggie, don't you see? No, I don't see. Quittin'? Don't you go being ashamed, Jim Flannery. For a man to respect his wife is nothing to be ashamed of. You listening to her? And you, what do you know about respect for women or anybody else? You've got a lot to answer for, Cully, a lot to do to get clean. You get out of Cholla and don't you ever come back. Well, how was it? Easy. Looks like it wasn't so easy with him? How about you? I came back, didn't I? Let's go. Don't you wanna know how much we got? We'll count it across the border. Come on. You can read them, Pop. What are they saying? Near as I can make out, they're several parties of 'em. Trying to talk it up. They made the first move this morning. What was it? I ain't sure. I know what it was, the store. Looks like it. Cully. We ain't turning back, Lolly. Ah, he's gone lame. Get down, Lolly. Greasy got it quick. It will be safer in town, little mother. I'd know them any place, they're smart, Jim. Mount up! Jim! Cully? It figures. Be careful, Jim. I'll be careful, all right, but I won't lie to you, Maggie, one way or another, I'm bringing Cully and the rest of 'em back. Let's go. They got trouble, broken shoe, lame horse. Where does that trail lead, Pop? That's to the border, two or three miles. The one to Shadow Valley goes around to the east there. Pick up your rifle there and we'll get goin'. Stopped here and then rode south. How many were there? It's hard to tell. It's all mixed up. Three, maybe four. Come on! Yaqui. Bhumer made the turn-off on the Shadow Valley trail. Four Indians came in and followed them. There'll be more than four where they're headin'. A little earlier and those Indians would be following us. Yeah, Cully, about an hour you'll be shooting at Flannery from across the border. Let's water up. Our only chance is them rocks. Mount up! Get up there. Why don't they shoot? They will. First, they gotta play with us a bit. Tease us like. Oh, Bhumer's been around. He can take care of himself. I wish we didn't have to hurry for the border. I'd take me a bath, to get clean. You'd be in bad shape. Your padre'd never recognize you. We'll split this up the other side of the border. I'll collect my cut later. That Cully. He's got a lot of faith in us. Why shouldn't he? We're his sidekicks, ain't we? Taking real good care of his interest, ain't we? I always said you had not guts. Split it up on the other side of the border and wait for us. Hey, Bronco. Wait for me. It's Cully. Come on. We'll give them cover. Yaqui, you all right? He's dead. You'll be all right, sonny. No one's called me sonny for a long time now. Lolly, Cully is a good man. Tell Cully... Where'd you get 'em? We robbed a bank, Mr. Bhumer. The Bhumers are mixed up with a bunch of bank robbers. I'd save my ammunition for them Indians. Stay here. You still got that low-shooting rifle? You got it figured. Oh, shucks. I always figured I'd die by a rope. Cully! Cully. They get Dutch? Yeah. Well, let me know when those bucks start back. Look. Flannery and a posse. How do you figure it, Sheriff? Well, if it's our friends, they ran into some trouble. Looks like the Indians did our work for us. Let's go down and have a look. Come on. Them bucks don't like that posse neither. We're gonna take him with us, Pop, to Shadow Valley, before they get here. I'm asking you, Pop. That'd be like taking a rattler home. I ain't gonna do it, Lolly. What about the chance he took coming here? Getting half killed for us. What about his friends? Yaqui, Dutch, and Bronco. Can we take them along with us? Fetch them horses. I guess it's all here, except maybe a few dollars. I remember this one. Huh! Just like I said, the Indians saved us a lot of trouble. Hey, Sheriff. Look at here. I'm following up these tracks. The rest of you, pick up that money and follow those Apaches. If you catch any of 'em, turn them over to the agent on the reservation. You figure you can handle it alone, Sheriff? Two horses made that trail. Smitty, Evans, mount up. No use, I've lost the trail. We'll pick it up in the morning. Can't seem to get it. Pop, we won't be able to do him any good, will we? He's hurt too bad, I knew it. There ain't a doctor in Shadow Valley. There's Pete Miller. He knows almost as much. It'll take riding all night to get Pete here. Pop. Don't let that wound get dry. Oh, Pop. Pop, if he gets well, say it'll be all right with him and me. But he ain't well yet, honey. And he ain't rid of that posse. Where are my clothes? You heard your father, I got to get out of here. If that's what you want, Cully. Come on. I haven't got all the time in the world. What are you running away from, Cully? Oh, if I only knew, maybe I could help. I wish I were older, and beautiful, and wise. I'll bet you had women who were. Sure, dozens. One special one? All special. Where are my clothes? Then they didn't love you enough. Not like I do. Now, listen, with me you'd have nothing but trouble. Nothing but runnin'. Lolly. I'll try Jones and Miller. You two take Bhumer and Matthews. And if we find him? Pin him down and wait for me. Good morning. Good morning. Hmm. You shouldn't have left your bed. My bed? Where is my gun? I wanna thank you, Ms. Bhumer, for everything. Now, if I can borrow a horse, I'll be leaving. I don't know all the things you've done, Cully, but if you can't stay and face them, wherever you're going, take me with you. No. You don't have to be afraid with me, Cully. I wouldn't try and make you do anything you didn't wanna do. You're a woman, aren't you? I love you. Lolly. Stay inside, Cully. You shouldn't left that Apache pony outside. We spotted you easy. If you figure we're the only ones out here, you're wrong. The sheriff will be here any minute. So be heating up the coffee pot, Cully. We'll all be in for some. Looks like neither one of us are leaving. Cully? It's Jim Flannery. Are you coming out, or do I come in and get you? Jim! I've got a girl in here. You wanna hurt her, keep on shooting. You've got the spine to face me like a man, I'll come out to you. We can get around on the other side, Sheriff, we'll move in together. I'm waiting for you, Cully. You lost your mind? All right, Jim, I'm coming out after you. I'm relieving you boys as deputies. Put those guns away. Wish me luck. Cully, please don't do it. Don't go. Did you forget your little speech already? You said you were never gonna tell me what to do. All right. Don't worry about me. I'll still go with you, Cully. So go ahead and kill. You've done everything else. Yaqui, Dutch, and Bronco, what did they die for, Cully? For this? Pop was right. You're a gunslinger! That's all you are, Cully, a gunslinger! And I don't want you! Hear me? Whatever happens I don't want you. All right, then. Shoot straight. All right, Jim. I'm whipped. But you didn't do it. She did. You're not whipped, Cully. You couldn't be, not ever. I'm ready, Jim. He'll get a fair trial, Flannery? It'll be a fair one, Bhumer. If she's lucky, she won't have to wait too long, that's if you call getting Cully lucky. Oh, Ms. Bhumer, I found this in one of the boys' saddle bags. I imagined it must be for you. Nice, honey.
