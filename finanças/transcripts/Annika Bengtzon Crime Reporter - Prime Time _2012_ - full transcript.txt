Secretary of the neo-Nazi movement. Michelle was an immigrant. Michelle's mother came from Lithuania. - Where in Sweden is that? We have poor reception, I can hardly understand. And Barbara and Patrik. - Two of our own journalists. Patrik is a real journalist? Maybe for it pleps. I heard. They may not say anything while the investigation is still ongoing.

I may go, but I have the mobile production truck here show. Did you know Michelle? - Yes. She was a good girl. Do not let anyone talk into something else.

It was a farewell party for the cameramen. Production Assembly tomorrow. You, me and Anne. I got up at six o'clock, the bus back to Dalarna. But Stefan stays here. - Stefan? Does not he go home?

What's wrong with him on? Friends, listen up. What a great week. You are the best in the business. You too, Michelle. - If you insist. Really, you guys are great. Thanks, all. Cheers. Gunnar, I want you to have this. You did not have to do that. - I want to thank you for your help. I hope we see each other again soon. You're a treasure, Gunnar. A big applause for Gunnar. Those who do not continue to go now. Too bad, but alas. That's all I know, Anne woke me up. Anne? - She has found Michelle. What happened after the crew went back to Stockholm? Why can not I just leave? - Answer me, then we'll see. What happens if I leave now? - Will you be arrested? I did not do it. - Anne, listen. Your fingerprints are on the gun. You found her. And you are furthermore the only one without a valid excuse. I did not do it. Sorry? - I did not do it. Okay, let's start again. What have you done on the night of the murder. Anne? I'm sitting here. What were you that night? I saw all the same that she had something special. When my company Build & Create started she was the mega star. We were just a big international project launch, so this is ... extra sad. We were two peas in a pod. Now I feel incomplete. Can I have some perspective? - Sebastian Follin of Build & Create. I really expected a judgment of you, good people of the press. Well, we have not determined lost a genius. Annika? What do you think? She was not exactly Gandhi. This is really a circus. It's May day, We have better things to do. My taxi there. Have you interviewed Essex '? - That I really do not tell you. Do you have to take pictures? - There we have it later. Wake up, Dad. Wake up. Stop it. - Grandma wants you to wake up. Yeah, I guess. Good morning. Can you not longer hold? - I have to get ready for the guests. Guests? What guests. - Just what neighbors. Eleonore? - It's nice to have company. Would you know my ex-wife invited as Annika was here? Do not be silly. Go wash. - Yes, do daddy. Yes, yes. I get it already Kalle and Ellen. Hi, Thomas. Leave a message after the beep. I'm Karin Bell Horn and I'm in charge of this production. I want to say on behalf Zero Television that they are one of our best. Michelle Carlsson was not only a colleague, but also a friend. Of our management, we a portrait of Michelle broadcasting. You are all invited. The time and place is still unknown. Thank you. - Why was she murdered? When is the portrait? - Are you questioning? Here comes the Nazis. - Did you know Michelle? Are you a neo-Nazi? - No, I'm Swedish. Does the police a link between the murder and your political preference? You dirty whore. If I were you, I would commit suicide. Cunt. Need help? - Yes, please. Are you Annika Bengtzon? You work with Anders Schyman? - Yeah, you know him? No, not really. Why do you think someone Michelle Carlsson to murder? Michelle was ... She was ... Good on TV. Good for business. She created good publicity. Our face to the world. - She clung to the attention. Do not fall, there was Michelle well. Very good. She knew no gossip news. It's entertainment. Here's my card. Call me if you have any questions. Annika? Everyone is released, except Anne. Here, take my car. I drive it with Olle it. My source says that it is be some time before she is released. Okay. It's okay. - Goodbye. Olle, wait. The police want you something confiscated equipment retrieves. What kind of equipment? - No idea. I will send a courier? All right. Tore? Apply it directly to me. With Thomas. - I am. What do you want? I've called a few times, but ... Are the kids there? - They are sailing with Holger. Do they have life jackets? You know what? Go to hell. Thank you. - Cheers. It is so nice to sit here. In silence. Silence at the dinner table. Quiet in the car. Still in bed. Not everything was bad. - Rewrite history not. It's just nice not to argue. - Quarrel? Nothing could our cares. How are you? It ... okay. Anne? The car is there. I want to talk to anyone. - You do not. Why did you most recently released? - Can you turn around, Anne? We can go to my house. Thomas and the children are with his parents. What a fluke. - Everybody says that. You hate it there. What happened in there? - Can we talk about this later? Do you have wine at home? Do not you? - No, but go ahead. I hate this business. I hear producer, not a hostess. Everything I do is make coffee. - Why are you not a producer? I do not know. I work my ass off. And then she comes. Michelle. And everyone is right on her feet. I had long ago to stop. - What would you do? Behind the checkout sit. Then there is a reason that people say that I am worth nothing. That sounds like a good plan. You'd look good in a orange suit. I try to find myself pathetic. - You do that pretty well. I do not wanna talk about it. - I know. Can I sleep here? - Go ahead. Thank you. Have you already studied the murder weapon? - Do you sleep ever? Fingerprints? - Very much. Just about everyone. Also from Michelle? But suicide is not it? - No, we do not think. And Essex? - Checked and innocent. Who do you think did it? - Who do you think? Not Anne of Gunnar. Barbara and Patrik either, I guess. - No? Anne would not it be, Gunnar is too stiff. Stiff no alibi. It suits many serial killers. A friend is not an alibi. Have you been released? To whom? And when? They have brought the Nazis. - There's something about Snapphane published. They also wanted to be a presenter. Too bad we did not know. What we seem now fools. - We had Essex. How did that program it received? He no longer occurs. What's the plan? - Here, for Bambi ... I do the police and it forensics team. - I have witnesses and Michelle. And Snapphane also. - Annika. Do you want to come to my office? You're fired. Close the door. - What's all that? Spiken? - Does not help me. What is this? - We have our camera back. How can they now release? - They were firmly done. Patrik has taken. - Or Barbara. No, this is where Patrick is looking for. There are photo numbers break. - I have moved them. It's her gun, why is she here met. We can not keep still, we need them right again. Keeping it change. We take bits from all episodes. Guests, artists, everything. Sorry, busy morning. - When are you free? Maybe you had a lot to tell ... We have not much time. Does anyone know what to do? I do not. - The material for the show upload. Then start. Show? It was still a portrait? - Look. For God's sake, Sebastian. Take it easy. Everything about her go through me. - We make a portrait. It is our responsibility. - Everything about her go through me. Call my secretary and make an appointment. Do you hear me? Now what happens to her is my responsibility. I hear it, Sebastian. I want you to leave. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. No, thanks. I do the end again. Welcome to The Castle, I'm Michelle Carlsson. Good. A little more to the left. - To the left? Is this good? What are you doing here? Michelle trusted me. Because I'm famous. Do you have Lovers' Nest seen? So you were with Patrik? Do you work with him? - We're in the same newspaper. Michelle had a tiring recording and asked whether I wanted to be. She had trouble with someone? - Just like everyone else. Like what? - With Stefan. She felt threatened by him. - Why? Something between them. - Were they a couple? A very long time ago. Why she felt harassed? - Because he's an asshole. She was pregnant and he was married. - Michelle was pregnant? Yeah, but she did a ... - An Abortion? But that was really long time ago. I do not know so well. With whom she had even more trouble? - That assistant. She was so terribly common. They did a sort of audition together. Anne Snapphane? - That's my point. She was terrible. But Michelle was professional. People could be so jealous, even though she earned money for them. Especially those nasty manager, Sebastian. He must be happy now. He deserves much fixed her death. It would not surprise me if he is the murderer. I think I'm the only Michelle who really knew. Is this all High Definition makeup? - I do not know, it's not mine. That's it. Back in Stockholm I take another manager. What? - You have to Barbara fetched. That's not crazy. - But it is good for us. I want those gossip not with me around. Or you. What do you mean? - You're fired. Get out. More champagne for us. - Cheers. This is for you. This is for you, Sebastian. - Handsome not break corset. Your ex-manager. You're there, old man. - Who asked you? The bus to Stockholm departs so. - No. Those who do not continue must leave now. Who would this really do? - So they fired him? She had it years ago already be doing. He was scary. He was spying on her. He was almost obsessed. We need you at the intake of the bottles. Now. You take quickly. Who did you think I was? Nobody. Has something happened? - No, you want someone to talk to. First, I'm going on all shares of Michelle. And that means? - You call me if you want to know something. And you can get much more ... if you have a business deal closes with Build & Create. We will not pay for news. - No, but I'm not selling gossip. What do you sell? - The truth about Michelle. Did she not fired? They fired me every week. She could not live without me. She knew that. She was like a child. I wanted to say how good you are to me. Cheers, you are the best. - Cheers. Let me remind you the bus leaves in ten minutes. It's time to go. - Champagne. Patrik. What's the problem? - Karin's special stock. Let's get this party more fun. Can you stop that haggling? - Go on, honey. You have talent. You're such a jerk - What did you say? That's not good for your career. - Do not listen, he's an old bag. Then took that moron one pistol. Anne, this way. Let me n picture, aim the camera. Stefan, you're really such a wimp. - Aim the camera. Wait a minute. Give it here, take a picture of me. - Stop this now. Jesus. - Are you crazy? What was that? So Michelle and John Essex went off together? I tell you everything if you make a business deal. Have not you had enough money to its earned? Maybe your boss understands the value of my offer. I do not. Stop that gehark. Makeup. You've probably busy. - PR is part of my job. So Michelle, I understand that they are not really popular. Is that correct? - I would not say. Big projects like these lead to conflicts. There is no going back. That party was the last party for Michelle as a presenter. Not because she died, but because they were doing other things. It may sound strange, but ... she had lost control. She was very difficult to work with. And she was also not exactly getting any younger. She was only 34. - On TV you look ten years older. She was a wonderful hostess. In her own way. One of our best. Do you smoke? - No. I need a cigarette. This is the reception. The police are here, you should come down. The graveyards are full of irreplaceable people. But she was the show. Michelle Carlsson was no TV. TV, Michelle Carlsson made. Now it's time for a handsome face. - Appearance is not so important. Symmetry is the most important. The left and right side of the face The eyes should not be closed to each other. Pigs Eyes. And then there's that unknown thing ... What do you mean? - You must be out of the screen. I can imagine you it would do on TV. That is certainly not without a screen test but the camera holds on you. You have ... It is not integrity. It is your expression. People wonder what you've seen. I heard you the gun took away. - That's right. What did you do with it? What are you doing, fucking? Are you all crazy? You're drunk, go to bed. - I want to talk first. Say it. "Woman and Sofa". - Oh, for God's sake. That was five years ago. Why did Michelle got that job, and not me? I'm 100% better qualified than she was. I had a great screen test. Hers was ridiculous. I have a better resume. I'm a journalist, have serious experience. Maybe you have not the right people shared a bed. I found Michelle's credentials more impressive if you ask me. They also talked about you to others. She made them afraid. People do not trust neurotics with a drinking problem. Go to sleep, Anne. Look at your little girl pick tomorrow. Where is Anne? We know each other. We interrogate Anne Snapphane. - And Hannah Persson, the Nazis? We have her released. Hi, I'm Annika. I am looking to Hannah Persson. Is that your mother? May I come in? Little shit. - Annika Bengtzon, Kv?llspressen. Hannah is there? - They do not want to talk. That she can tell me herself. - Shit, he does not. Go to the side. Hop, aside therewith. Annika Bengtzon, Kv?llspressen. - What are you doing here, damn it? I just want to ask some questions. Why were you at that party? - I was invited. For the show. Three feminist lesbians talk about politics. One of them turned by and hit me until he bled. So I was there when the party started. - Hi, honey. Can you take a sandwich in the kitchen? Are we then football. This lady is so gone. Go away. Why did you have a loaded gun at you. Did you want to shoot someone? Why did you do it? You're a loaded gun at a party. - For God's sake ... That old witch took it off and I have not seen. What are you doing, fucking? - Quiet, nothing happened. Go to bed, all. - I have nothing to do. Now if you go to bed no. - Smile, Karin. Excuse. - Sorry. Hi, Michelle. - Turn the music up. I'm gonna fucking talk to her. Then he came back with those pictures. Guess what she 's doing? - Who? Essex and Michelle - Let's see. This is going to cost you the head, Sebastian. The headline of year - Motherfucker. Let me see? - Get out. What the hell are you doing? - You're crazy, Sebastian. Shut up. Keep your fucking mouth. Where are you looking? I kick you in your face, dirty Nazi whore. They are the meanest, nastiest assholes I've ever met. And they thought they knew me. - You did not say why you had that gun. I wanted to just test. Look how tough they were. Where'd you get it? These are not sold in Sweden. That's what you told the police. - Go to hell. You have told how 'm have smuggled into the country. This is the answering machine of Anne Snapphane. Please leave a message. I'm back. Call me. - Annika. The Carlsson article? Twenty minutes. Is it as good as that Nazi Rule? - Had I but written. We have nothing. - She admitted that it was her gun. Not really. Is Snapphane arrested? Annika, that would be something. - It's just an interview. We must do something. Unfortunately, they let go of Essex. A good, juicy gossip What does the police? He was never a suspect. Sit in a limo to the airport. Here seat with nothing. If Schyman was not so pretentious. I could write address. - Thank you. I want a love triangle with a rock star ... but I get a gun in the slums. As if that news. Stefan? This is my house. Get out. - You're talking furniture destroyed. What happened? Stefan? Will you stay here? - Hello and welcome to The Castle. Michelle, pose for me. Michelle, can I talk to you? Not right now. - Now. Michelle, please. Why are you avoiding me? - I do not. Is that so? If we can be together? - You can not. We're not together anymore. I want you all night something. I've told Sanna. I'm away from her. It's true. - Why would I now believe? Can we stop pretending, Stefan? It really never happen. It's over now. - Have you met someone else? I get it. You need me anymore necessary now that the weather is going well with you. How can you say that? Got a influential person found? - I've never been in love. I've never hoped or as long I waited like you did. I wanted that baby. But you know what? I'm over it. Crazy, right? I thought all this time I would never get over it. Me the rest of my life so would continue to feel. Love someone who does not loves me like a criminal. But then I was suddenly over. - I'm away from her, I promise. We get that baby does. I promise. Good luck with your life, Stefan. Hi, I thought I heard the car. Annika Bengtzon, Kv?llspressen. Do you write about Michelle Carlsson? I've never met her, but ... It's so awful. Frightening. Come as you are in? - Yes. Hello? Hey. I was already waiting for you. I have a headache. I am already throughout the day to Michelle Carlsson. Do you know what that is? Why did not you call? Anne. Where are you looking? - I do not know. How much did you drink? Have you somewhere aspirin? - No. What did the police? Anne? Talk to me. - So you think you can write? I will only write what you say. I'm trying to help you. If something happens, you should .. - Do you think I've done? Go to hell. - It does not matter what I think. Tomorrow, the Kv?llspressen a picture of you with a gun. Say what happened. - I do not know. I do not know. The whole evening is a big black hole. Are you happy now? Why did not you just say? - I do not want to talk to you. Anne, do not be childish. - You know why I'm here? You're my best friend. I thought you would help me. You care about is your stupid job. How does Thomas' t matter with you? What? - The potatoes were overcooked. What does it look like meat? It looks ... perfectly. Which service do we use? - The East Indian. I get it. Oh, I see. We also have soup. I wish I could help you. - I'm almost done. You know what I mean. Dear Thomas, you do not have to pretend. I know it's hard. You make it difficult to correct. - I? What do I do? You just whines. - What? It is not surprising that they do not feel welcome if you photograph exposes. Watch your words. - That you do not. You know, Eleonore did not want children. Annika has given your grandchildren, be grateful. No, I'm not really here to listen. What are you waiting for? An apology? I feel terrible. - Me too. I feel terrible if you behave. Good morning. - What is this? This is not even a real newspaper. - Do we have a meeting? Where are the pictures John Essex and Michelle? That is pornography. - Then I publish them anywhere else. Fine, but they are not yours. It is the camera Kv?llspressen. You're a good reporter, Patrik. But this is not a good story. All right. Patrik has good intuition. - He has no intuition. And those photos we could not publish. - But sales. The British tabloids would be a fortune to pay for photos of Essex. Coward. It will fall over. Have you no hairspray? Do you know the opening? - Yes. Do you know where Anne's? She has to leave me. Do you know what it is? Now it can not hurt anymore. Michelle asked for a copy of the production unit recordings. You take that on? - For behind-the-scenes material. Was that secret? - She wanted her film work. I helped her. You put it on half speed and takes 12 hours. That's why you got that whiskey? But the shots were hectic. I almost forgot. I remembered only just before the last recording Is this the last day? - Yes. You get shadow on your face. - Turn from the left. Then I draw everything again. - It's important. Okay, let's do it. - Thank you. We need to listen to it. - I have no time. Now. Turn it on, Karin. Fifteen seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven ... - Ready. Six, five four ... - Camera two runs. two, one ... - Action. Go ahead, Karin Good evening. My name is Karin Bell Horn and I am producer at Zero Television. We are gathered here to honor our colleague Michelle Carlsson. A very talented, strong-willed young woman. Her disarming way of doing ensured ... people around her is seen and felt loved. Thanks for the coffee, I go. - With great sadness ... we say goodbye to Michelle. - They started. I'm calling. - We all do feel the loss. Michelle was young ... - Gets what a boring place. I was expecting quite a bar. - Poor Karin. Good heavens, what are you talking about? Michelle dreamed. - You know how she remains at the top? She dismisses everyone too far climbs. Does anyone have more than two years worked with her? I spent five years working with her. - And you still put coffee? Good career. You're her perfect doormat. But the memory of her will always remember. Thank you. I'm Sebastian Follin the owner of Build & Create. With great joy we announce ... that in Zero Productions have found a new partner ... To Michelle's legacy high. Our first collaboration is a documentary ... Michelle, her life and her work. That was all. Back to you, Karin. Karin? - Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian. Now it's time for ... Where does this? - Andreas, which stores it? It is not from here. - We do not know where it came from. Directed Room, to the commercials. Now. What is this? What are you planning? Oh, please. What are you laughing at? - To you. You're a spinster. You tell me what I should do. I'm sure of it. You little, spoiled ... What? I'm your guest book, I write scripts, I keep things running. How about a thank you? - Thank you? You think you're so important. - Do not take that tone with me. I'm your boss, Michelle - Not for long. What do you mean? - London called me. Not you, they have called me. They asked if I want my own show. Prime time. I'm producing. And I choose with whom I can and will not work. You're lying. - Not. They have not even called you. You does not count, Karin. They call me now. I can ensure you'll never get work. I will not listen to you, slut. - It's so easy, Karin. You are sidelined. You have nothing. No husband, no children. All your energy in a job stopped. You will soon no longer have. - Shut up. Keep your own mouth. You're history. People like you are a sad, ugly, old bitch. That they think of you. Why do not you sit on the couch? Sit back and look heroic. How do you look heroic? - A bit of John Wayne. Annika ruining it. - No, that's not bad. Can you get that? It is London. We're done here, right? - Yes, fine. Hello, Anne Snapphane. I think it is ready in three days. Hello. - Mama. Hi, darlings. Did you have fun? We were in the hospital. - Grandma had a heart attack. Is it good again? - Yes. Dad yelled at her. - Really? Why? Because she was mean about you. - Really? We got burgers. - And Sweets, even though it is not Saturday. I missed you so much. Hi, sweet licorice. Make a little. The next time you come. Then you have me first an honorable wife. I will. But not just to prove something. - We do not need more. We're getting married because I want to. Would you do that? - Would you? I'm confused. We talk to marry or not to marry? Let's get married. - Okay. Hey. - What's that for? You can not just say okay. - Okay, let's get married. Let's get married. - Okay. Hello and welcome to The Castle. We discuss here about big and small things. Important and unimportant all in one show. With performances and interesting guests we put the winter outside the door. The bitter winter gives way for joy and romance. Maybe it's as simple that when the spring arrives ... We all just begin to live. I'm Michelle Carlsson. Welcome.
