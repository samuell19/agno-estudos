As was the case with many treaties with the Indians, this one was broken. The question of which side first broke the treaty is still disputed today. It is known, however, that the head one band of Apaches would not necessarily feel obligated to honor the decisions of the leader of another band. On May 16th, a troop of cavalrymen, under the leadership of an ambitious young lieutenant, attacked and massacred a sleeping camp of Mescalero men, women and children. The leader of that Apache band, along with his woman, were among the few survivors. Ironically, he and his people had believed in and respecting the treaty. That once peaceful men who had opposed killing, now became the feared and hated warrior. He soon came to be known to white men throughout the territory as Sh'e ee Clit Soak, the man who wore the yellow shirt.

That wasn't thunder you heard a while ago. That was my big gut tearing up my little one. And I'm affixing to head it off before it gets to my backbone. - (laughs) Well, you reckon we better pitch in fellas. The rate Lem's going we ain't gonna have nothing left. (plates clattering) (solder sighs) (soldier sighs) - Ain't you grubbing tonight, Major? Seems to me you'd get enough of that writing just making out them survey maps in the daytime. (horse neighs) (dramatic music) - [Major] Sam, you gave us a start. We didn't expect you back so soon. - Had a change of plans, Major. Sort of figured you'd be more interested in this than camp meat. - [Major] Little bit of Yellow Shirt's handy work. (coffee trickles) - I'd hoped that renegade had learned his lesson after the skirmish we had at the Big Muddy last spring. - Wolves don't change, Major, once they've tasted blood. - Were there any others with this man? - Near as I could tell, there wasn't. He was a dispatcher from Fort Blanding. I found this on him. It's made out to you, sir. - "The treaty with the Mescaleros has been broken. Yellow Shirt and his band have ambushed the supply train from Fort Haynes and butchered all troops. You are hereby ordered to return to the safety of the fort immediately, signed, Colonel Redding." Men, we're gonna break camp in the morning. Private Hatfield see to the burying of this man as soon it's light. - Yes, sir. - Corporal Hawkins, you take the first watch. - Yes, sir. - Private Simmons, you'll relieve him. - Yes, sir. - [Major] Come on, men, let's get this fire out. (fire hisses) (dramatic music) - Your watch, boy.

What do you make of them devils stopping like they did? - I don't know, Trooper. I don't think we better wait around here anymore and try to find out either. Let's pack up and get out of here. (throat clears) - I appreciate what you've done for me, Mr. Glass. - Forget it, boy. I'll be scouting ahead, Major. - Sam, you know the Apache better than any of us. Why do you suppose they quit last night? - Well, my guess would be they're having a little fun. When they get tired of the fun, then I think we better prepare for dying. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (mellow dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (bear growls) (horse whinnying) (bear groaning) - Trooper Hatfield. - Sir? - Break out the shovels. Looks like we've got another grave to dig. - Are you sure we got time? I ain't looking to end up buzzard bait. Let's hightail it out of here. - That's an order, Trooper. - Yes, sir. - I don't what you thought of this man, Lord. I grew to like in the past few months. He was a bit head strong, but that's the way of mountain men, I suppose. (Sam moans) - Well, I'll be a son of a- (dramatic music) - He can't last more than a few hours. I'm asking for a couple of volunteers to stay with him until he dies, and bury him properly. - That's asking a might lot, ain't it, Major? - Are we no better than those savages we're running from? I'll see to it that whoever stays gets double pay. - Ain't much need for money with your head split and wide open from a tomahawk. - Under the circumstances, I'll forgive your insubordination, Jenkins. What's the matter with you men? I don't thinks there's one of us here doesn't who doesn't owe a debt to Sam Glass for something. And what about you, Trooper, where would you be now if Sam Glass hadn't sucked the rattler poison out of your neck that time? And you, Hatfield, who was it pulled you out of the muddy when the Apaches shot the horse out from under you the last spring? (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) - I'll, I'll stay. - Double pay, huh? That's a mighty tempting offer, Major. - [Major] You're volunteering? - Yeah, I reckon I am. - All right, the rest of you men mount up. We've got 75 miles ahead of us, of playing cat-and-mouse with Yellow Shirt. We'll move as slow as we dare. You men'll probably catch up before nightfall. Come on, men. Let's go.

You're making me nervous. - Sorry, just thought I heard something. - You're gonna keep hearing things out there until you jump out of your hide. - Lem, what ya gonna do with your extra pay? - I'm gonna get me a quart rye. Yes, sirree, a quart of the right glutenous rye you've ever seen. That's what I'ma getting. - Hey, boy, did I tell you about the time I caught myself one of them Blackfoot squaws? You know them Blackfoots, they're different them those Dogface. They don't mind a white man thrown in everyone once in a while for variety, I reckon. - You think if I gave him a drink of water, it might help to ease him a bit? (Lem spits) (water burbling) (dramatic music) - Indians must have got them, Major. Otherwise they would have caught up by now. - Let's stop here for an hour or so and give the horses a breather. Maybe they'll catch up by then. (powerful music) - It's sure taking him a hell of a long time to die. - I don't see how in the devil he can last much longer. - You stay here, boy. I'm gonna take a look around. Them Injuns may be down our throats any minute. (powerful music continues) (hooves clomping) (exciting music) (dramatic music) (hooves thundering) (hooves thundering) - Lem? Lem, is that you? (gun bangs) (hooves thundering) - You darn fool. You darn near blew my head off. We ain't staying here now. That shot'll bring every Injun from miles around. (suspenseful music) I told you, let's get out of here, boy. - But, Lem, he ain't dead yet. - Far as I'm concerned he is.

I know that I said I'd be home by now, but Major Henry promised me a bonus for this last trip, and it means that we'll have enough money to buy that little piece of ground that we've always wanted over on Spring Creek. I hope you like the music box. - [Sam And Martha] I picked it at Sutter's Store a couple of weeks ago. - [Martha] Trooper Joe said he'd deliver it along with this letter. Tell little Sam he's to be a good little boy and help you with the chores. And tell my little Rachel that Pap will make a cradle for her dolly when he gets back. Martha, I know it's been rough on you and the kids. But we'll be together soon, the way a family should be. I love you, Martha. I love you very, very, very much, Sam.
