Watchman! Where are you going with so much luggage? Are there more guests in the bungalow? There are no masters. This is the luggage of my own people. I will give them on my way. He is so silly. Carries other people's burden without any reason. Naubat, when did you arrive? Silly Baldev, I've been waiting here for 2 hours. Where had you been? Come in first; I'll make you a cigarette. We'll talk later. No! First tell me where had you gone. I was cooking when I realized there were no vegetables. So I thought I'd get some potatoes. And I got late there. - Baldev, is some ghost after you? Ghost?? What are you saying? So how come your bag is filled.. ..with this coal instead of potatoes? What did you say? - See this. - O God! What happened? - The bag is exchanged. - With whom? How would I know with whom? There were around 10 - 12 bags. Yes, you know Nandu who works in railway? - Yes. He gave me this bag to give to his wife. How will she light the stove now? But my dear, how will you cook the potatoes now? That's also right. Yes! My bag must be at Nandu's place. Baldev, shall I tell you some thing? - Yes. - You are silly. You can say anything; you are my buddy. My dear friend, why do you take.. ..other people's troubles on yourself? These are not troubles. They are my own people. And what will I lose if I do small tasks for them? These own people, all of them consider you the ox of zoo. Zoo?! - Baldev! Hey Baldev! Here comes your granny. Deal with her now. What did I ask you to bring for me? Bananas, peaches, apples.. and oranges. Open this bag and see whether there are any oranges in it. Why don't you answer? Speak! See, Naubat, what tragedy he has done on this auspicious day. Shall we have to cook.. ..non-vegetarian food and be sinners? Lord Ram! You won't even get the water of Ganga here. I made a mistake, granny. This is brother Kadar's bag. My bag must be somewhere, too. You bag, granny.. must be with him. Wait here; I'll go and find out. Forget it. Just give me back my penny and I'll go home. Naubat, can I.. - May God bless you! Here, granny. - Don't know whose face I saw this morning. I made a mistake. - A mistake? Do you agree now? - Agree to what? That you are silly? Do people call a man who helps others a silly? These days they call him a leader of sillies. Now Mr. Kadar will come in a while to thrash you. And Nandu will come to smash you. Baldev! - Here comes your uncle. Go and handle him. Greetings, uncle. - You idiot! My guests are hungry. And you are chattering here with this silly? Oh uncle. lf you did not want to bring.. ..non-vegetarian food, you could have told us. I ask you to do some tasks as I consider you a family man. But listen.. - You've defamed me in front of my guests. Here's your bag. My dear, would it have been a trouble.. ..if you had given me the bag on your way home? This is the result of the company of these vagabonds. That's ok, but he must have given you some other bag. Who are you to ask that? - Yes, uncle, that bag of fruits? Not fruits; there were vegetables. We cooked them. But, uncle, it was someone's bag. - So what can I do? At least give him the money of the vegetables.. Don't interfere, Naubat. Had I asked for the vegetables that I should pay for it? Uncle, the money for this food.. Am I doing some charity? Uncle. Naubat, I will go and check everyone's bags. Are you fasting today? When will you cook for yourself? Yes, let's cook first. But what will you eat? The potatoes have turned to coal. Will you listen to my request? - Yes. Will you really listen? - Yes, dear, tell me. lf you eat only Rotis everyday, you will have acidity. Listen to me and get married. You'll get someone to cook, and will also have some sense. And you will get out this habit of helping others. You feel shy, watchman? Just agree and.. ..I'll find out a girl for you. A very pretty girl. - I will do this task myself. You won't be able to do it. This is a delicate matter. Naubat, I've already found a girl. Have you? In reality or in dreams? She is my dream girl. And I know she also dreams of me. Have you ever talked to her? So how did you know that? - From her eyes. You don't understand a 6 feet man.. ..and you can read the eyes of a woman? I understand her eyes. - I see. So the matter is fixed? Who is she? Some one. Why should I tell you? Look, when I can't trust your brains, how can I trust your eyes? It is better to take the advice of.. ..intelligent people in the matter of women. Just show me her once. Will you see her? - Yes, I will. Now? - Yes, right now. - Ok. Look there. O God! I should hide somewhere. What happened, Naubat? Look at her with my sight once. Idiot, look at that fat buffalo with my sight. What did you say? Fat buffalo? Wait! I'll thrash you! - What are you doing? Baldev, my pal, my friend, my father, my brother.. You are silly. You are stupid. You are the ox of a zoo. You are out of your senses. You've gone mad! Press slowly. That fat woman broke my bones. Baldev, please don't marry her. For God's sake don't marry her. Naubat, you've misunderstood. She wasn't that one. - Who then? She was the one standing behind her. - Who? - Gopa! Why didn't you tell me that before, silly? At least I could have seen her well. See her now. - No, I don't want to. Take my advice and marry her soon. Then I'll see her and also eat the hot food she'll cook. But.. - No ifs and buts. Marry her soon or someone else will. But how do I marry her? Tell me some solution. This is the only solution. Talk to her tomorrow morning. What do I talk to her? - I'll explain you. Come now. Gopa! - What? Gopa! - What? Gopa! - Gopa, Gopa, Gopa! I've been hearing only this. Don't you know how to speak anything else? Gopa, I will marry you. "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" "She's a fairy, she's playful, she's stolen your heart" "She's a fairy, she's playful, she's stolen your heart" "I will see her face till the morning" "You will get to see a pretty woman" "O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "She is your queen, and you are a handsome Rajput" "She is your queen, and you are a handsome Rajput" "You are gutsy, so also have a strong heart" "Our eyes will meet" "O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" Ramdas! - Yes, child. - Shall this also be sold? No, child. Just as a child is not sold. A mother is not sold either. I've never seen my mother. But whenever I see this statue, I remember her. My mother was just like this, wasn't she, Ramdas? Yes, child, madam looked just the same. Have faith. Ramdas will sell himself.. ..but not let the statue of your mother be sold. Will this property you've gathered.. ..after years of hard work be ruined today, sir? Don't know why God writes such fortune for good people. This is life, Ramdas. It is the law of nature.. ..that the life goes on. The man dies and the wealth meets calamity. lf it weren't so, wealth would have been a trouble to people. What I fear, sir, is that.. ..when this house will be auctioned forcibly.. ..how will you save your precious dignity. I am not worried about my prestige or dignity. The dear sign of my son will become homeless. What will happen to my granddaughter, Ram? I've served you all my life, sir. Now without repaying.. Honest tears are more expensive than service, Ramdas. You've repaid more than you should by crying on my sorrow. This means that I won't be able to do anything.. ..except crying to save the prestige of my master. What else will I be able to do, Ramdas? - Master! When my son died an early death.. ..worrying about how to repay the debt of Madanlal.. ..I had explained his daughter that.. ..child, I have heaps of wealth for your needs. But I won't be able to save anything today. God helps those who want to save. You are worried about your grandchild unnecessarily. Am I right, Mr. Madan? - Yes. What do you mean? Mr. Madan is ready to stop this auction. Am I right, Mr. Madan? - Yes. What's the reason for this favor? There's no favor. It's a matter of give and take. You marry your granddaughter to Mr. Madan.. ..and he is ready to stop the auction immediately. Right, Mr. Madan? - Yes. Do you expect me to marry my granddaughter.. ..to this scoundrel and dishonest father? Look, mister, I am a lawyer. I wish well for everyone. I think Mr. Madan's request is quite reasonable. And in this situation no one.. am I right? I will call this Mr. Madan's kindness.. ..that he is ready to let go of 1 lakh 20 thousand rupees.. ..despite getting tied in a trouble like marriage. Shall I ask you something? - Sure. Ask two questions. Are you a lawyer or a marriage broker? This house and all the furniture are lying before you. Just do your work quietly. I don't need anyone's favor. Mr. Madan, I want to tell you something. - Yes, tell me. Please, come. What did you gain by hurting my poor grandpa.. ..who is already helpless due to his circumstances? I am hurting no one's feelings. It is your misunderstanding that you find my favor hurting. Is taking advantage.. ..of someone's helplessness called favor? I am ready to let go of my credit.. ..worth lakhs of rupees for your dignity. I want to give you a better status by marrying you. Do you call it taking advantage of your helplessness? Mr. Madan, we are in trouble at the moment. We need sympathy; don't aggrieve us. I have nothing to do with anyone's joys or sorrows. I just want myself to be happy. I also want happiness, for my grandfather. lf you want an expensive thing like happiness.. ..you will have to accept my offer. What if I don't? - So? I will ruin you. I will auction these symbols of your prestige. I will make you beg for a bite. I will ruin your family's prestige.. Enough! Don't say a word more. So, do you agree to my offer? Give me the token then. Come close to me. Come. Such token must be the tradition of your family, not mine. I will deal with your family's prestige. What's the reason to cancel this auction? - God's wish. This is strange! You were auctioning yesterday. And today it's canceled? - It's God's wish. So why did you call the buyers over here.. I told you it's God's wish. And who'll pay for our transport fares.. That's also God's wish. - Good! Grandpa, how come you're up here? It's a market down there. I want to talk to you privately, child. What's the matter, grandpa? The matter is very embarrassing for me. My son, daughter-in-law, and other relatives.. ..handed you over to me before they died. I thought I had more than enough wealth. I would not act miser.. ..when using money for your needs and joys. But today when this house and other things will be auctioned.. ..and we will have nothing left to us.. Granpa! Hasn't Ramdas told you? - Told what? The disagreement is over. Now we won't have to leave our house or other belongings. All obstacles are out of our way. How? How did this impossible task take place? When luck favors you, the killer himself comes to save you. Madan.. Mr. Madan.. - What about Madan? He wants to marry me. lf my marriage to him solves this problem, why not do so? What? - I will marry him. It's not a marriage. That devil wants to buy you in auction. Marriages take place with some give and take. There's no buying or selling in that. It is a give and take of friendship.. ..to strengthen the ties of relationships. This is buying and selling. Mr. Madan is a very rich and kind man, grandfather. I am lucky that I got this chance.. ..of saving our family's prestige. I am very happy today. So happy that I feel like singing. I am very helpless, child. Don't make me hear your sobs in the name of singing. "She got the king of palaces" "Your dear daughter will rule over there" "Bid her farewell with a smile. Your daughter will rule" "She got the king of palaces" "Your dear daughter will rule over there" "There will be an uproar in all the streets" "There will be an uproar in all the streets" "All shoulders will carry the bride's carriage" "Her heart will dance in that carriage" "Her heart will dance in that carriage" 'Your dear daughter will rule over there" "Bid her farewell with a smile. Your daughter will rule" "The family she will go to, will become a heaven" "The family she will go to, will become a heaven" "She will maintain the prestige of both the families" "That is what her parents will bless her with" "That is what her parents will bless her with" "Your dear daughter will rule over there" "Bid her farewell with a smile. Your daughter will rule" "Daughter is someone's wealth" "Daughter is someone's wealth" "Who is ever able to keep her with himself?' "Don't feel sad for that" "Don't feel sad for that" "Your dear daughter will rule over there" "She got the king of palaces" "Your dear daughter will rule over there" "Bid her farewell with a smile. Your daughter will rule" "She got the king of palaces" Mr. Rai has come. Greetings, Mr. Rai. Come in. Please, come. Coming, sir. Please, come. Forgive us, Mr. Rai; we bothered you unnecessarily. You mean? - Mr. Rai, the auction is canceled. The reason? - The reason is very interesting. Am I right, Mr. Madan? - Yes. What is the matter after all? - Come in and I'll make it clear. Come. That means you want to buy the daughter.. ..of the debtor in exchange for the debt. Nice deal. The pretty girl will remain indebted to you.. ..and will also get all this in dowry. Mr. Madan, you are a true businessman. Child, what is this rude behavior? I am not misbehaving. I am just praising the decent man. This is bad. No matter what one does.. ..you have no right to taunt him. The storm is getting stronger. Excuse me. Rama, come; I'll introduce you to Mr. Rai. He is a very rich man. Come on; why do you feel shy now? He is my dear, elder Mr. Rai. She is Prema, Mrs. Rai! You know her; she is my.. Glad to meet her. Mr. Madan, I am impressed with your choice. Please, be seated. I think you won't be able to return soon. I will arrange the meal for you. Ramdas! Rama, you just spoke out my thoughts. What is it, child? - Get the meal ready for them. Just arrange for the food; I'll arrange for the drinks myself. Mr. Madan, I've seen your choice. Now at least show me the things that I wanted to buy. Yes, please come. - Come, Prema. Who are you? - What? I asked you who you are. I make pictures; I mean I am a painter. Painter? Over here? I was out to look for a good scenery but.. ..that Almighty Painter spread his colors before I could. Please, come in. - Thank you. Who are you? - Well.. Who are you? Why don't you answer? I am a painter by profession, singer by hobby.. ..and a refugee by the circumstances. In total you're a vagabond, right? You can say that. It can also be said that in ancient times.. ..painters and singers used to be the honor of royal palaces.. This is neither a royal palace nor some refugee camp. Go away from here. Get out. Please, don't get angry. A person behaves rude when he is angry. Will you teach me good behavior? Perhaps I am not capable of that. - Go away from here then. You won't go! Mr. Madan, I still full rights on my house and myself. You, please, be seated. I regret that I've created a displeasing situation. It would be better for me to leave. - Go if the rain stops. I might have to wait long for that. Doesn't matter; wait a bit more. Sir! Who else has come? Some man has come in to get shelter from rain. She is talking to him. Take care of him. - Why, sir? See that no one returns without having food.. ..in this hustle and bustle of the auction. You are too much, sir. Here, take the medicine. What are you doing here? Come and sit in the hall. I've known that.. ..you are a painter by profession, singer by hobby.. ..and a refugee by the circumstances. But summing up those three, what is your name? That mister has already totaled that; a vagabond. It is also a fondness to put one's self on target. It is interesting. - Meet her. She is Mrs. Rai and he is.. Vagabond! Excuse me. I'll be back in a while. Ramdas, we will have to cook for one more person. Can that be done? - Do you need to ask that? lf I'm cooking for 10 people, I can cook for one more. That's good. Guests and more guests. They are indebted, but won't stop inviting guests. Like grandfather, like granddaughter. Where do you live? - I live in the city, but.. We are also going to leave from here after having the meal. We can drop you on the way. It is time for dinner. You can also have dinner with us. Thank you very much, but I won't be able to eat here. Why? It's late and also raining.. And he must be hungry, too. Yes, I do get hungry.. ..but there's difference between hungers. And the difference is that a rich man kills the hunger.. ..while a poor man is killed by the hunger. Perhaps you want the hunger to kill you. No, it's not that. Actually, this.. ..invitation will prove expensive to me. You speak as if you had come to a hotel.. ..and we were going to take money from you. You might not, but I don't eat free of cost. Ok, I'll decide. In return.. In return you make a picture of the host. Is that ok? You had said that you're a painter by profession.. ..and a singer by hobby. Forget the profession and fulfill your hobby. My hobby is going to be fulfilled in a very strange way. Listen! Why are there labels on them? These are to be sold. - To be sold? Why? It's a play of times. My sir says this is life. What are you looking at? These statues are so beautiful. Feels like they'd speak any moment. I don't understand how anyone can value them. Are these to be sold? They were to be sold, but now no more. - Why? A face is sold instead of these statues now. Misters! The meal is ready on the table. Come and eat it. You come, too. Let's go. Come on. Come, Prema. - Please, come. Grandpa was talking about that man from Darjeeling.. Have a seat. No, no. You sit over here. You sit there. You sit here. Isn't that painter sitting here with us? Oh! That prince will have food alone? Why are you entertaining that irritable person? It is the tradition of this family to look after the guests. A guest is considered God in this house. What are you thinking? I am thinking that.. ..the price of this food will be much more than this picture. Is it because you're drawing it.. ..or because it will be my picture? - Yes? I asked you to sing because the value of my picture.. ..won't be enough to get you a meal for one time. Even my profession and hobby together cannot value you. Please, eat the food. Tell me. - What are you doing? - Drawing a sketch! You understand sketch, don't you? - Sketch? Yes, that means lines. I bring life to lines and guess the nature of that person. Don't try to trap me. I know very well the nature of people like you. Where do you live? Why bother about that, sir? This is a journey. When the night falls, I stay wherever I am. So do you intend to stay where you've eaten free meal? Mr. Madan, I didn't know a person could.. ..quarrel so much with another person. You are our guest. Please, don't embarrass my good manners.. ..by insulting a guest in front of me. "When I didn't get flowers, I made friends with thorns" "When I didn't get flowers, I made friends with thorns" "This is the way." "This is the way I spent life" "When I didn't get flowers.. ' "Come what may; I will face the situation" "Come what may; I will face the situation" "I found my God." "I found my God and have worshipped him" "When I didn't get flowers, I made friends with thorns" "Our eyes hadn't met and yet I saw her" "Our eyes hadn't met and yet I saw her" "I hadn't said anything." "I hadn't said anything and yet I talked to her" "When I didn't get flowers." "The one who loves silver and gold" "The one who loves silver and gold" "They will say someday." "They will say someday that they committed suicide" "When I didn't get flowers, I made friends with thorns" "This is the way I spent life" "When I didn't get flowers." Whom should I praise? The picture or the one who made it? It would be wrong to praise the painter.. ..as he was busy singing, and this picture is just a copy. And it is not possible to praise the picture. You've done much more than the price of the meal. A beautiful picture and a lovely song. We got this deal for low price, right? - What do I say? One needs a mathematician's mind to value these things. lf you had not made a deal with me.. ..I would have had to roam out in that storm all night. lf it is necessary to value,.. ..it is me who got the deal for cheap. Mr. Rai, I don't think we will be able to go back at present. The storm shows no sign of stopping. Why not stay here? They will make arrangements for you for tonight. Am I right, Mr. Madan? - Yes. All right. Mr. Madan has the chance of playing host tonight. Yes, sure. What do you intend? They are not going now. So how will you get a free ride? I want nothing for free, mister. Don't worry; my legs are not at the mercy of cars. I am used to walking. lf you are used to that, why don't you go from here? Don't know how these poor ones dare to speak such rubbish. Those who are poor with money are rich with courage, sir. Are you going? I am supposed to go. How can anyone go out in such weather? Those who can't, stay back. I can go. I should go. At least stay back till the storm recedes. Not only this storm, I can wait till the pace of life stops. But perhaps my staying here will increase the storm. Perhaps the world moves only when I move. He's come back again! Thinks he's not at mercy! He's used to walking! Gopa! Gopa? Who's Gopa? I am Rama. Greetings! - Who else is in this house except them? There is a lady cook in the house, and the sir's driver. Where are they? - In the kitchen. Lakhan Singh, find out whether there's someone else, too. Do you see now what I said? Now I get why he talked so arrogantly. He was the spy of these goons. What rubbish are you talking? What spy? He was invited to meal, was asked to sing.. ..and was also offered a lift in the car. He had come to inspect an opportunity. Now pay for it. What are you saying? - That man was your spy. This man seems to be out of his senses. Shall I repair him, chief? Who's come? - Don't know who might have come at this hour. Go and see. Sit down. It's so dark and stormy outside.. ..but still someone knocks on the door. I've forgotten my bag here. My bag. Wait! Where are you going? To where I had come from. Stop! We are not the people of this house. Let us go. Keep quiet! Sit down. Sit down. Sir. Chief, let us go. We will make you happy. - How? We don't have much as we are on a trip. But I might get 1000 rupees in my wallet. - Get it. Keep it! You might need it. Baldev?! What is in that bag? Whatever I own is in this bag, mister. Two vests, a towel, a shirt and a soap bar. Colors, 6 brushes.. - Move this wreckage! - Wreckage? Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I am a widow with kids. I work hard to bring up my kids. Don't kill me. Shut up! Don't scream and shout. We are your guests. We don't kill our hosts. You only rob them! lf you talk too much, I will pull your tongue out. Go and cook food for us. Quickly! Right away, sir. Keep an eye on this old woman. And you, driver! Sit facing that wall over there. Go! You're dictating as if you were the chief of goons, Baldev. You got it right; I am Baldev. So you are the chief of goons, Baldev Singh? Are you more intelligent or good hearted? The government has decided a prize of 1 .25 lakhs on you. I know those scoundrels very well.. ..who have raised funds and given to government to arrest me. I am very glad to meet you. You shouldn't be glad, but scared to meet me. I am a very dangerous goon. It's not your fault. I have seen more dangerous goons than you. Look at him. He is the son of the king of goons. His father had given my son.. ..a credit of 20,000 rupees six years back. Today this goon has come to ruin us by making it six times more. What are you? You do illegal tasks. What is he? He is a legal robber. He seems to be a son of a fool. He must know that, Why the owner give loan. To collect the entire property from them. His son is not satisfied with this.. ..he want to take all our property. Rather he wants to snatch away a child.. ..from her old grandfather in the form of interest. Please, grandpa, you keep quiet. What sort of people are gathered in this house? Ask me; I'll tell you. You've known him and my grandchild. And I think.. she is this rich man's daughter. No! She is my wife! Wife?! Rich man! You've come here to recollect six times your Rs. 20,000 loan. You want to buy an innocent girl's body for your credit? I am marrying her. And you, Gopa? - Rama! You want to mortgage your life.. ..with this moneylender for your debt? Do you really want to marry this indecent man? Marriage, marriage, marriage! Leave me on my own for God's sake. My wedding is my personal matter. I will do whatever I want. What is it? - I've found a very good thing. Really? - Yes. - What is it? - Shall I show you? - Yes. Got scared! Hungry dogs! Mind your language, mister. They've got guns. They're acting brave because of those guns. lf they didn't have the guns, I would have taught them a lesson. Why? What are you blabbering? Beware! No one will move! Mind you! Come this way. Come! Put your guns down, and turn to the wall. Turn! Where will you escape now? I will repay for my master's favors today. And will repay his debt with the prize being declared on you. Mind you, Ramdas! I don't want to pay my debt by selling the life of my guests. Put the pistol down. - Don't stop me today, sir. I will get the prize declared on this goon.. ..and will free our child from the custody of this man. Ramdas. No, Ramdas, no! - Rama, move aside! Put the pistol down. - No, child, move away. One shouldn't take anyone's life in return of favors. Put away the pistol. - No, child, I won't spare him.. Move aside.. Ramdas. Scoundrel! Who told you to fire? Why did you stop me, child? Why? I would have freed sir from his debt today. - Let me see. Come and tie the bandage. Come. Come and wash your hands. Here's the soap and the towel. Please, wash your hands. I hope the wound is not deep. - No, nothing serious. Go and rest in your room. I'll look after everything here. - Ok. What wrong did he say? Why did you stop him? Listen! You could have freed yourself from the.. ..trap of that businessman by getting the prize declared on me. Why did you lose this chance? Why did you act so stupid? What is stupidity to you can be cleverness to other person. Everyone has different ideas and principles. Your principles are wrong. Such principles are sold for peanuts.. ..in the market of this world. You are unlucky, Rama.. ..that you want to give your life on purpose. Strange! Why are you feeling bad for someone's injuries? You won't get it. Only a woman can understand a woman's sorrow. I wish I could make her feel the pain.. ..of being sacrificed for wrong principles. It is so surprising. What? What would have Ramdas gained by what he did? He did that for me, right? He didn't even care for his life. I've been traveling through out the country. And have tried to find loyalty in people's eyes. I've seen till now that the clever people of this country.. ..prefer to be deceitful rather than being intelligent. An intellectual wishes to die with his knowledge.. ..rather than sharing it with others. The stronger ones are tyrants, and the rich ones misers. Even the poor ones don't want to get rid of their poverty. Rather they want to see others to be poorer than themselves. I've seen duties and ethics being sold out in this country. But what I've seen tonight is novel. I feel like giving my life for the.. ..silver lining I've seen on this stormy night. Whose turn? - Your turn. - Is it? Ok, my horse kills your soldier. - But this soldier is yours. Made a mistake. Sorry. My horse will come back. Play now. - It's still your turn. - Really? Here, my horse kills your soldier. But the horse moves only 2 112 steps. How can you jump here? It will move that way! My camel kills your horse. Your camel killed my horse? Is my elephant sleeping over here? My elephant will kill your camel. But how can the elephant move here? It will walk just this way. It was bored standing over there. Play now. Ok, my horse kills your elephant, too. Which is the strongest player of them all? - The minister. Ok, my king will kill your minister. You're finished then. - What did you say? I'm finished? No, no, I mean your king is finished. - My king finished? I mean this game is over. All right, all right. We'll now start another game. Second game. Everyone is sitting over there. Shall we go and chat there? No, I won't go from here till I finish your king. Play! Are you alone? - Absolutely. Are you facing much poverty? Have you ever seen an elephant? - Elephant? Why? A dead elephant values more. - So? I am poor alive. But when I'll die, I'll cost more. You're trying to mock me? I've never mocked anyone except myself. What's this? Whose picture is this? His! His? He can scared away a buffalo with his stick. Is this his portrait? He can scare away a buffalo,.. ..but he won't be able to cut a straw. I think he is very idle. What is this like a frog? It's not a frog; it's him. Your companion. Are you crazy? He can climb 3 floors in few jumps, and you find him a frog? Have you ever seen a frog jumping? This is too much. And what is this? A cart without the oxen? He can pull a heavy cart himself without the oxen. And you see him as a cart himself? Get yourself a pair of glasses. You suffer from fogginess. Whose picture is this? - Hers. You're a crack! Does she look so sad as you've made her to be? Yes, she is just that. I don't see anything except.. ..the pain of a burning candle on her face. I'm impressed. I agree that this artist has very penetrating eyes He has known me totally. - What did you say? Speak! Why are you silent? I am alive because I am conditioned to remain silent. I've been dumb from birth till this day. The one who loses her father before being born.. ..the one whose mother dies after giving birth to her.. ..the one who learns to speak in an orphanage.. ..and who grows up on the mercy of others.. ..only a good hearted person will understand her sadness. Shall I ask you something? What is the reason for getting you married to this old, cruel man? For God's sake, don't say that. He is my husband. Call him a social worker.. ..a brother of the poor, a charitable man. Don't call him a robber of the youth. I cannot forget that day when I was.. ..rehearsing the dance for the charity show of my orphanage. And this generous man had come to give away.. ..his body, soul and wealth to better my life. Prema, are all the girls ready? - Yes. Mr. Rai has come over. It should look like a show. There shouldn't be any flaws. lf he is happy, our orphanage will get to see good days. Hurry up! Mr. Rai has come. Don't take it as a rehearsal. It should look like a real show. "No, no, no! Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "You might be pricked by a thorn" "Don't leave the branch with a jerk" "Don't leave the branch with a jerk" "You might be pricked by a thorn" "My father planted this tree, and my brother looked after it" "My brother looked after it" "My mothered watered it like a gardener waters flowers" "Like a gardener waters flowers" "Where have you come from, o foreigner?" "Where have you come from, o foreigner?" "And how did you catch the branch?" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "You might be pricked by a thorn" "No one casts evil eyes. No one dares to look at it" "No one dares to look at it" "These are the plums of Shabari; no one can touch them" "No one can touch them" "Those who want to taste them" "Those who want to taste them" "They won't be able to get them" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" 'You might be pricked by a thorn" "She threw away the sour, and kept the sweet ones" "Shabari was very clever" "Shabari was very clever" "Laxman understood how much love.. ..is filled in those half eaten plums" "Laxman understood that" "Only Ram will recognize me" "Only Ram will recognize me. I am a devotee of Ram" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "Don't cut off the plums from the tree" "You might be pricked by a thorn" "Don't leave the branch with a jerk" "Don't leave the branch with a jerk" 'You might be pricked by a thorn" So you want to marry that girl, Prema? Yes, I want to serve as much as I can. For how many days? - You mean? I mean you are a very old man. You're using a very rude language. I might be, but I am telling the truth. I am just a few years more than 50. That means only a few years less to 60. Men older than him.. Have been doing this stupidity! I agree to that. What do you have to do with this matter? Every living being called a human is related to this evil. Who are you to decide what is right and what is wrong? I will surely marry that girl; no one can stop me. What's the matter? The matter is that I don't change my intentions. Can money make a person so arrogant? I wouldn't want to be insulted like this. Tell me the way you want; I will be available! What is this rude behavior? I cannot tolerate it any more. I will wait outside. What is the difference between in and out? The truth is the same in this room as it is outside. lf you take my advice, sail the oceans if you dare. Lower down the mountains, ruin the valleys. But for God's sake, don't ruin the lives of innocent girls. Had I sent you to arrange for this piece of advice? Where is that madam? - She's gone to get your girl. What happened, Prema? You behave so strange sometimes, uncle! The orphanage is filled with hungry, poor, half dressed girls. lf one of them gets the shelter of a rich man.. ..wouldn't she be called a lucky girl? That person is lucky who gets love even when he is poor. And that one is unlucky who have everything. This girl is being sold for money, not love. Poverty is nice to be sung only in poems. The ups and downs of life cannot be passed without money. Prema, you're getting a rich family. Good fortune is calling you. This is not a day to cry, but be happy. Mr. Rai has given this cheque of Rs. 1 lakh.. ..after being impressed by your beauty and dance. So what if he is a bit old? Forget that. This orphanage will never forget this favor of yours. Humanity will always remember you. Look there. The helpless, hungry faces. Do you remember what hunger is? Perhaps you haven't forgotten that. What is a woman after all? You tell us, Mr. Madan. The slave of a man. - You are absolutely right. And do you know what her duty is? How do you know that? It is to serve the man and entertain him. Right. This is the reason why a man spends lakhs of rupees on her. Just as I did. But, Mr. Rai, you gave that money to the orphanage in charity. And have married that girl. A rich man never gives money in charity, he destroys it. I gave the money, and bought the goods in exchange. You've married, Mr. Rai. And marriage is.. Don't you know what a marriage is? Marriage is a drama invented.. ..by experienced people to fool a girl. Whether you marry or not.. ..the result will be the same for a woman. Mr. Madan has said a wonderful thing. Whether with marriage or without it.. ..what is it that a man wants after all? Pretty face, nice figure, and tempting style. Mr. Rai, I would have to praise the show of that day. Weren't you present that day? - Call it my bad luck. Why bad luck, mister? I've got that thing in my house now. Prema! Prema! Didn't you hear? - Yes, I heard everything. How dare you behave like this after hearing? I am your wife. - I've bought you! But I am still your wife. I am not used to bear rejection, especially in front of pals. I request you; please, don't degrade me. To dance openly to gain charity is good.. ..and the same is degradation in the house? I was an orphan and helpless then. But today I am your wife. A wife is a wife only till she follows the orders of husband. Come with me. Friends, meet her. She is my wife. Have a look at each of her styles, and praise my choice. Show a glimpse of that day to my friends. Let them know that Mr. Rai is an expert jeweler. Forget it, Mr. Rai. Your choice and expertise.. ..is already famous among prestigious people. No, this wife whom he has bought.. ..and your slave.. ..will surely amuse you today. So, this is how you burnt your dreams? Rama, I am warning you frequently. Don't sell yourself for this trouble.. ..by calling it your duty. It is easy to advise, but difficult to follow the same. lf you really sympathize with her, pay back my money. I am ready to kill my desires and love. You are a wolf greedy of money, in the guise of a man. You don't have a heart of a human, but of a businessman. Why do you call it love? Will you teach me what love is? You who has insulted love? The one who has killed his own wife.. ..will teach me the secret of love? It's false! This is false! - No, it is true. The world and all the government records prove it.. ..that you trapped an innocent girl in your love.. ..married her, and then you wanted.. ..to make money by selling her body. When she refused, you cut her body into pieces and threw away. You are talking about love? It is false! False! False! What is this going on? This is the house of a decent man, not some market.. What this man is saying is false. It's a false accusation. People might call me disloyal and a murderer,.. ..but it is not true. I haven't killed my wife. I only loved her. Gopa! If this is the truth.. ..if I've really loved you.. ..free me of this accusation of murder. I am telling the truth. I was not born to be a goon. Never did I wish to snatch away anyone's happiness. I always wanted to see every one happy. Mine was a simple life. I had only one dream, only one song. That dream was realized. That song, I sang it after I married Gopa. "My beats unite with the waters of the river" "The river unites with the sea" "No one knows which waters the sea unites with" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" "The river unites with the sea" "No one knows which waters the sea unites with" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" ''The earth is thirsty of sun." "And the moon is thirsty of earth" 'Moon is thirsty of earth" "Every soul is thirsty, like the oyster in the water" "Every soul is thirsty" "O dear pal." "Every soul is thirsty, like the oyster in the water" "No one knows which cloud the drop of water is hiding in" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" "The river unites with the sea" "No one knows which waters the sea unites with" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" "You recognize the song on the unfamiliar lips" "You recognize the song" "The one who was stranger till yesterday is now my soul-mate" "She is now my soul-mate" "O dear pal." "The one who was stranger till yesterday is now my soul-mate" 'No one knows what might happen at what moment" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" "The river unites with the sea" "No one knows which waters the sea unites with" "My beats unite with the waters of the river" I've married you. How do you feel? - Nice. Gopa, the place where I've brought you.. ..is the highest in village. There are rivers on all sides. What is beyond them? Gardens, orchards. And beyond them? - Mountains. And beyond them? - More mountains. And beyond them? - Beyond them.. I've spent many nights in this place. But the this night is so intoxicating! Right? Raindrops are falling. Looks like it will rain. I.. I will be right back.. ..after closing the doors and windows of that bungalow. Gopa, have you ever dreamt of anything? Yes, I did once. About what? Is anyone in there? Watchman! Watchman! Watchman! Who can that wretched be at this hour? Are you the watchman of that Daak bungalow? Yes. We called you so many times. Were you asleep? No, sir, I was not asleep. - Come and open the bungalow then. Bungalow? - Yes. But it is booked. Some officers are going to come. When? - Don't know. They might come in the morning. Morning, right? - We can stay here tonight then. I don't have the orders, sir. You don't have the orders? But I do. lf you have the permission, who can stop you? All right. - Listen! What is your name? - Baldev. Baldev, we are very hungry. Arrange some meal for us. But there is no arrangement for food over here. How can that be? How will we spend the night? How would I know that, sir? There's a shop down at the village. You can go there. How do you cook? What about me? I used to cook myself till now. You won't cook now? - Now? I won't cook at least tonight. Why? What's the matter with tonight? Don't know who they are. Why have they dropped in at present? They might be government officers, but they are hungry. So? - So? If they are hungry, they should get food. Are we doing some charity here? We are lucky that someone has come.. ..to our house on the first night of our marriage. Gopa! "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" "She's a fairy, she's playful, she's stolen your heart" "She's a fairy, she's playful, she's stolen your heart" "I will see her face till the morning" "You will get to see a pretty woman" "O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "Why are you restless? You have the rest of the night" "Why are you restless? You have the rest of the night" "Talk to her to your heart's content then" "Her black hair will be lying on your shoulders" "O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "She is your queen, and you are a handsome Rajput" "She is your queen, and you are a handsome Rajput" "You are gutsy, so also have a strong heart" "Our eyes will meet" "O heart, have patience" "You will be embracing her silver body" "O heart, have patience" "You will meet the bride. O heart, have patience" I've come, sir. I got late as I could not find some vegetables. Here. Doesn't matter. Keep it with you; it is a tip. - A tip? Yes, it is a prize for you. Thank you very much, sir. Did you find anything? - Yes, sir. There's hen, eggs, onions, potatoes. I found every thing. Very good. How do I cook it? How do I cook these things? Don't worry about that. Your wife will cook it. My wife? - Yes, your wife had come.. ..to arrange for water and lights. We've explained her everything. We will eat whatever she cooks. You can go. Ok, sir. - Listen! Yes, sir. - Keep this. Cast evil eyes away from your wife. This is from me. This, sir? But this is too much, sir. Baldev, I am very happy today. Keep it. What was the need for that, sir? Take it. - Thank your very much, sir. Gopa! Gopa! Gopa! Don't touch me. - Gopa? Stay away! Stay away! What happened, Gopa? - I.. I am robbed. What did you say? They robbed me. I am robbed. Stay away. Don't touch me. Now I have nothing to give you. Nothing. No! Gopa! Gopa! Why are you laughing? I am very hungry. Hungry.. hungry.. take a cigarette.. Baldev? Come, Baldev, come. You must have worked very hard. You must be tired. Come and drink some liquor. Baldev, drink some.. and your tiredness will be gone. Your wife must have been very happy to receive this big tip. Yes.. Baldev. ..and she has sent me to repay for that. Perhaps I hurt your feelings. Why did you come up like this? I did not even want to tell my story. No matter how bad people consider me.. ..I don't want to show my sorrows to anyone. But I could not bear the harassment.. ..of that man on you and I poured out my feelings. Gopa! - I am not Gopa. I see my Gopa in your face. I had understood that. I knew this. I will blind every evil eye that is cast on you. I will save my Gopa from the world and hide her in my arms. My heart is restless. Gopa! My brother! - Don't call me brother. Look into my eyes. You will find that I am not your Gopa. You're not Gopa? Yes, Gopa is dead. Gopa is dead. Gopa is dead. Gopa is dead. Whose portrait are you making? The face is the same, but the clothes have changed. I wanted to see.. ..how this face might look in a villager's outfits. What happened? Why are you surprised? Gopa! With the passion of a sad heart.. ..you killed so many innocents to revenge for one woman. So? - I think you are once again.. ..trapped in such situation after coming to this house. You are no longer able to bear tyranny. Don't know what you might do.. ..by seeing another woman being tormented. Why don't you know that? I will fire bullets in that man's chest and take away his life. The quarrel will end then. - It does not end the quarrel. His responsibility will remain as usual. A lawyer is also present here. Then I will have to rob these rich people. How will that help either? One cannot repay debts with the robbed money. The government will want to see the account. Then? - Then I feel Mr. Madan will also.. ..sacrifice that girl's life like Mr. Rai did. What are you blabbering? How can he do that till Baldev is alive? You are stubborn; you can't think. You are clever; you tell me. Is there some trick? There is. Kill me. - Kill you? Why? Because my body is useless and my dead body is valuable. You have gone crazy. Who will benefit from your death? Baldev.. ..according to my uncle's will.. ..I will get big amount after one month of my marriage. And what if you are not destined to marry? I can still write this wealth to anyone's name. But she will get that amount only after my death. lf I write my wealth to that girl's name.. ..she will be freed of this trouble. Then write your will, and fire a bullet on yourself. Why do you want me to be responsible for this murder? I fear that my suicide might blot her name. Otherwise I wouldn't have flattered you. Silly, you want to give your life.. ..for a girl you've met just 3 - 4 hours back? Even a meeting of a few moments.. ..is enough to give one's life. Do what you are told, and go away from here. Fire the bullet. Bullets have become quite expensive these days. Look, Baldev, if you won't kill me, I will kill you. lf I succeed, the prize on you will save that girl. lf I die, she will get my wealth. She will get over her trouble both ways. So, what do you say? Stupid! He is so stupid! What's the matter? Tonight is a very peculiar night. This painter wants to give his life in charity. For whom? For the goddess who has.. ..come down on this earth in the form of a woman. The decency of whom provokes a man to act pious. To save whom a mere servant pointed a gun at me. I am ready myself to kill that businessman. This crazy man is eager to sacrifice his life for her. Chief! Chief! Beware! Chief! One of the hostages is missing. - Who? That servant, Ramdas. - Ramdas? - Chief! Sir! Sir! There's a prize of Rs. 1.25 lakhs to get Baldev arrested, right? Yes. - Come with me quickly, sir. - Where? To the house of Mr. Dwarkaprasad. - But who are you? I am his servant. Please, come fast. Or that goon will escape and I won't get the prize. lf he really is goon Baldev, he might have already escaped. No, sir, he won't. I tell you,.. ..sir, this is the opportunity. Come fast. What proof do you have that the man in your house is Baldev? See this, sir. He is Baldev, right? Yes, but there might be someone else who looks like him. We've been misled before by wrong information. It was me who was misled. lf I had not been injured by a bullet.. ..I would have brought his dead body. Many people have dreamt of killing Baldev for the prize. Go! Why do you bother yourself? Ramdas! Ramdas! What happened? What is going on in this house? Someone tell me. Ramdas! Ramdas! Chief, we should leave before that servant comes back. We are in danger. - Let's move fast, chief. Why should we put ourselves in danger? Ramdas is not in the house. Where has he gone? - Don't know. I hope he is not gone to inform the police. Will my loyal people defame me in this old age? Please, go. I request you to leave. I want to settle some account before I leave. No, Ramdas does not want to kill you. That good man could not think of any other way to save me. Let that old man come. In his zeal to save me.. ..he forgot that he is playing with someone else's life. Have mercy on me. Go away from here before the police come. The moment of decision has come. I will have to settle the account today. Before some time.. ..I wanted to kill you and settle all your accounts. But perhaps it is not in my fate to kill you. Give me the car keys. - Why? - I said give me the keys! Here, you all move from here fast. - But you, chief? I still have to settle an account. No, chief, we won't leave you.. - Go! Why are you getting involved in this give and take.. ..and putting your life in danger? Go away. I request you, I beg of you; you still have a chance. Run away. Wait. Inspector, arrest that wicked man. Where is that goon? Where is Baldev? - He escaped. - Escaped? Where did he run away? Don't know. He ran away in Mr. Rai's car. Where did he run away? How did he run away? And why did you let him run away? Rama, I risked my life to save you from trouble. And you want to give your life to that businessman? What have you done, child? Tell me. Did he cheat or were you fooled yourself? There he is! Inspector, catch him.. Catch him! Baldev, you are being surrounded from all sides. lf you surrender to us.. ..you might be saved from death sentence. It is useless to run away. You cannot escape now. It will be better for you to surrender than dying a dog's death. I tell you again, surrender yourself to us. Please, go. I request you to leave. I will repay for my master's favors today. And will repay his debt with the prize being declared on you. No power on this earth could have controlled me. But it is a coincidence that my pistol got empty. But there are bullets in it. Have you settled the account you wanted to? Yes, all of it except one. Sir, will Ramdas get the prize for getting me arrested? Yes, he surely will. Just a minute, sir. I see that the one who used to call everyone stupid.. ..has proved himself to be the most stupid. Can I ask for something today? Will you? Whatever you'll ask today, Baldev, I will give. I want to take one of those pictures. I knew that. Take it. Sir, take me from here quickly. What did he take from you? His Gopa. Simple and truthful people have always been sacrificed.
