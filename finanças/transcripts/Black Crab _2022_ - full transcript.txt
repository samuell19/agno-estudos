NETFLIX PRESENTS ...in several major cities. 157 casualties and many injured have been reported, but the surrounding circumstances are still unclear. No one has claimed responsibility. Both sides are accusing one another. Riots and civil unrest have occurred in many districts as the civil war... What are they talking about? Mom? I don't know. It was... What? Hey, Vanja. Wasn't this the song that Grandma chose when we were in... - Oh, where were we? - Oh, that karaoke place. Yeah. Where was it? In Malmö? - Copenhagen. - Copenhagen. Yeah, that's right. Grandma got so drunk, remember? She thought she was so great... I mean, she thinks she's a really good singer. Well, I mean, I know that I'm not good, but... - Mom, what's going on? - Stay in the car. I'm just gonna check. Mom, what's happening? - Mom? - I don't know, baby. We have to get out! - Vanja, stay in the car! - Let go! - Vanja! Lie down! - No! Let go! I have to get out! Get down on the floor! Do as I say! We need to stay calm, okay? Be still and quiet, okay? Look at me. Do you understand? Do not make a sound, okay? Stay calm. Shh. Shh. Not a sound. - Mom! - No! Vanja! I have to get out of here... Back off! Caroline Edh? Caroline Edh? Come on. You're getting off here. This isn't my stop. I'm headed down south. New orders. Let's go! Come on. A car will pick you up by the soup kitchen tomorrow. Just shoot me! You can close it up. Send the train away. Back off. I thought you might be hungry. It's not poisoned. Are you going to the base? My husband's stationed there. Everyone says it's total chaos. That soldiers are found shot inside the compound and... I just need to know he's alive. He's not coming back. Don't wait for him. Head south. As fast as you can. Okay? Caroline Edh? - But you... Can you ask about him? - Let go. Hey! Let her go! Get out of here. I said get out of here. - What was that? - Nothing. - Lieutenant. - Nothing, Lieutenant. Your papers. You're so small. How are you gonna manage this? Manage what? Guess we'll see. Hop in. So, uh, you're from here? Yes, Lieutenant. Born and raised? Yes, Lieutenant. When were you here last? Many years ago, Lieutenant. Do you still have family here? I don't know, Lieutenant. Well, welcome home. Where are we going? The base. Yeah, but this is not the way to the base. I just need to grab something. Stay here. Don't step out of the car. Do you have anything? My child is starving. Please. Please. - Don't move! I said don't move! - Keys! The car keys! Give us the keys! Get back! Step out of the car! Hands where we can see them! Stay there. On your knees. I have orders. I was requested by Raad. Where's your escort? I don't know. Get in the vehicle. Stay here. We have an Edh here. She came alone in a vehicle. She can wait with the others. Go in and sit down. Are you the one they sent from the north? Yes. Hi. Hi. What have they told you? About what? Um... I mean, about why we're here? About the mission. Nothing. I didn't know until this morning I was coming here. What have they told you? I heard it comes straight from the government. From the government? There is no government, Granvik. It fell a long time ago. Lance Corporal Karimi, F28. - Okay, at ease. Welcome. - Thanks. You were lucky, F28. What? I said you were lucky, F28. What? What I mean, it was bombed yesterday. You were lucky to escape. Bombed? Huh? Where did you hear that? Tell me. There are so many rumors and lots of propaganda. Please. They say 3,500 have died. No survivors. It's all gone. Colonel Raad will see you now. Let's go. Leave your weapons in there. Move! Put your weapons and equipment on the shelves. Attention! One's missing. Never got here. - Never got here? - No. "A time for weapons, a time for wolves a time without mercy." "Brother slaying brother, parents slaying their children." "The sun is devoured and a harsh winter is followed by winter followed by winter." You know what that is? You may sit down. Captain? You... Why don't you just start. Sure. Just give them the truth. No propaganda. Contrary to what you may have heard, the situation is very serious. The enemy has taken out large parts of our units. They came from the north and bombed bases I17, F28, K22. So that's hundreds of kilometers we've lost here. The enemy will reach us in a few days. And it's just a matter of time until our base falls too. And when it does, we're completely cut off. And the whole coast is lost. To put it simply, we're about to lose the war. But we've been presented with one last option. Something that could change everything. Even put an end to the war. For the first time in 37 years, the whole archipelago is covered in ice. From the mainland all the way out to the open sea. But the ice is too thin to support a vehicle and too thick for a boat to push through it. But... it could support a soldier on ice skates. That's why you've been summoned here. So... Welcome to Operation Black Crab. Your mission now is to transport two capsules across the ice. From Tessenöy to here. The research facility on Ödö. Sideways, behind enemy lines. Like a crab in the dark. If you succeed, we win the war. You're free to leave the army, to go wherever you want, with immediate effect. If you fail, all is lost. Not just for you... but for all of us. Any questions? Edh? A hundred nautical miles on skates over saltwater ice? In the dark, behind enemy lines... It's a... a suicide mission, Colonel. This is not a request, Edh. It's an order. You're dismissed. Not you, Edh. Yeah, I mean, you're right. Not everyone is gonna make it. But that doesn't matter. It's enough if one gets there. One soldier. She can make all the difference. She can win the war for us. The others are... Well, the best we could get. And they can skate, but not like you. You know the archipelago, the ice... I'm sorry, Colonel, but... I don't think that's enough. I see... I guess she's bigger now than the last time you saw her. We found her in a refugee camp near the border. Wh... Where? She's on Ödö. You'll be reunited as soon as you get there. Yes, Colonel. Good. Can you tell me what happened by the car? He deviated from... - He drove in the wrong direction... - Will we have a problem with you, Edh? No, Colonel. - And you will obey orders? - Yes, Colonel. Good. Excellent. Then you're dismissed. May I keep the photo, Colonel? Yes, of course. Chance? This is not our chance. It's our death, Granvik. I'm telling you. Edh did say it was a suicide mission. If not even she... It was nice meeting you guys, but I have to go back to F28. I'm gonna find my girl. This base is the next to fall. The ice is our only chance. - What's going on? - I can't stay here. So you refuse to follow orders? You know what they do to deserters, right? It doesn't matter. I don't even know why I was chosen for this shit. Yeah, you do. 'Cause you're a good soldier and you can skate. Ehd, you said yourself ten minutes ago that this is a suicide mission. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. It's gonna be a fucking nightmare, probably the hardest thing we've done. But there's a chance we can make it. And we have to make it. When this is over, I'm going to find my brother. He's still out there. We'll find a TV that works and watch the Stanley Cup finals. Capitals versus Rangers. Best hockey league there is. What about you? - I don't know... - Yeah, you do. Hey... What will you do? Well, I was going to get married. Get married? That's a good plan. Of course, you should get married. I have six crates of champagne stuffed away. If you invite us, I'll bring them. Do we have a deal? Deal. Black Crab, everything under control? Under control. Good. Ice skates, ski boots, combat vest, ammunition, med pack, ropes, cords, spikes, other bits and pieces. Twenty kilos excluding weapons. Go ahead and make sure everything fits. Blue pills amphetamine, red pills morphine, the big ones cyanide. Keep track. What the hell is this? What do you mean? They don't look like my hockey skates. You've never seen a real pair of skates before? - Do we have any more stupid questions? - No, Captain. Sleep, eat, piss, take a shit... We leave tomorrow before dusk. When will the power be back on? I don't know. I wanna be able to shower on my own as well. I know, baby. Ouch. - Why are you pouring it all over my face? - Stop whining. Just be still. You're pouring it on my face. - If you stay still, it's easier. - I am being still. Okay, sit up. What was that? Mom? Maybe they've started bombing again. Get up! Up, up, up, up! Come on, get up! Now! Come on! - Yes, Captain! - Are you with me? Yes, Captain. - Need you combat ready in two! - Yes, Captain. Let's go! Come on! - Take cover! - Down! Okay, Crab. Eastern pier! Follow me! - Who's wounded? - One of the guards. These two are your mission. They have to be handled with extreme caution. They're absolutely not to be opened. And they can under no circumstances wind up in the enemy's hands. Lieutenant Nylund here will complete the group. Malik. Nylund. - Captain, you're in command now. - Yes, Colonel. They'll be hunting you. Move under cover of darkness. It's too visible in daylight. Two nautical miles you'll be in enemy territory. - Okay, Crab, are you ready? - Okay! - Now go. - Let's go! - Out onto the ice. - Let's go! That's us in a few hours. The old border. We're sitting ducks out here for one of their snipers. Good line of vision. Open landscape. You can't miss. Okay. It's just three nautical miles to Bastholmen. So we'll go there and wait until it's dark. - Granvik, keep watching the islands. - Yeah. Edh, you lead. - Check the ice thickness continuously. - Got it. Malik and Nylund, I need one of you in front of me and behind me at all times. Hey! Spread out! Down! Down! Down! The ice won't hold. Be careful. Rope! She has the capsules! Edh, no! No! I've got you. Hold tight! Where's Forsberg? What happened? Get the trousers. Keep her warm. If they haven't heard us yet, they have now. Are you good? Nylund. She needs to get warm. Let's take shelter here. Here. Put her here. Sit here. There... Clear. What are you doing? We need to make a fire. - It's too risky. - She'll die. I've got it. I've got it. - Are they okay? - Yeah, I think so. What do we do now? Hm? Um, I mean, Forsberg didn't have time to brief us. Nylund has the highest rank. He's the one in command. Why Nylund? He wasn't even at Raad's briefing. We shouldn't adhere to the chain of command? We should be led by someone who knows what he's doing, not the unit's reserve. I mean, do you know anything about ice? The archipelago? What are you doing? One member didn't arrive. And then Nylund showed up. We don't start improvising because we lost Forsberg. Whose place did you steal, Lieutenant? What are you talking about, Edh? Hm? Whose errands are you running? You left me! Just like you left Forsberg under the ice. - I saved the capsules. - And drowned her? No? You have no goddamned idea what you're talking about. I was the one who jumped in. I was the only one who did something! If anyone's a threat to this mission, it's you! Hey! Can we breathe for a moment? Can we take a breath? Hey. Now, if Edh hadn't jumped in the water and saved the capsules then we'd have no mission, right? And Nylund has the highest rank here. He's the one in command, and you just follow orders. Okay? Yeah. Good. Let's wait until dark. We leave at dusk. Take the first watch. If anything moves on the ice, we leave. Thanks. - Check the next one. - Yeah, locked. Oh, check it out. Snacks. Is it snowing? It's probably ash. The city's burning, you know. - What is it? - You hear that? Karimi to F28. Do you read me? Go. Wake the others! Malik, Nylund! They're coming! Wake up! They're coming! - What? Who? - What is it? How close? - A couple of minutes, maybe. - Okay. - Let's move out! - Go! Come on! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Edh, what are you doing? Edh! He spoke to someone on the comms just before the chopper came. - Edh, please... - Who were you talking to? - Lieutenant, I saw it too. - Okay, Edh. Calm down. Who were you talking to? - I tried to contact the base. - Whose base? Theirs or ours? Edh, please... Look at me. - Are you a traitor? - No. No? Then what are you? Are you stupid? Is that it? Are you stupid, huh? - Karimi. You get one chance. - Okay. I was trying to contact my girlfriend. She's a comms officer at F28. - Your girlfriend? - You said F28 was bombed, right? I just wanted to make sure she survived. That's all. How did they find us? Huh? How did they find us? They must have seen the smoke or something. Shh! Someone's coming. Shh. What do we do with him? He's a risk. Should I kill him? Should I kill him? He comes with us. Without a weapon. Malik, you take him. If he tries anything, you kill him. Let's go. We need to hit the ice. Get up. Your glasses. Here, take 'em. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. These fucking skates are killing my feet. It's too quiet. - At least no one's following us. - They're somewhere. Hear that? - It's just air bubbles under the ice. - Huh. It sounds like there's someone trapped under the ice. What are you doing? Get up! Edh. No lights. We're too exposed here. Edh, kill the light. Hey. Come on. - We have to go. - Coming. Don't look at them. We need to go. Fuck! Malik, watch Karimi. What the hell was that? A capsized lifeboat. They probably drowned. Froze to death. No. It was the enemy. That's exactly what they do. Kill anyone. Civilians, women, children. They don't care. How can you be so sure it wasn't us who did it? - What do you mean? - What difference does it make? They're dead now. We continue west at Sydkoster. That's not Sydkoster. It's Arholmen. Shh! - Arholmen? - Arholmen. Hey! Listen! Cover! Cover! They saw the light! Fuck... I was a millimeter from being spotted. Are you okay? Is everyone okay? - Where's Karimi? - I don't know. I lost him. - He went the other way. - Fucking hell. Shh. Black. Crab. - What? - Let's stay away from the ice for a while. We'll walk over the island. Come on. We have to hurry. They could be back soon. - Tracks in the snow. Someone's here. - Go, go, go. - There's a light on. What do we do? - You see the light? - Yeah. - Follow me. Hold up. - Can't we just go past? - Shh! Go in! Ready? Hands up! Hands up! Hands in the air. - Are you alone? - Yes. Clear. So what are you doing here? Here you go. Well, they... They burned down our house, so we... We moved here. I mean in the archipelago. It's been forbidden to live here for a long time now. Well, yes, but we have lived on this island since long before that. Yes, and where would we go? Walk for weeks to some dirty refugee facility across the border? Starve to death in some goddamned tent camp? So we decided to stay here at home. We hid during the evacuation. So it's only you here on the island? Yes, nowadays, yes. What's the name of the island? Arholmen. Why? Are you lost or something? You have a lot of nice furniture. Looks like Axel Einar Hjorth. That's right. It's Hjorth. You familiar with him? Yeah, and Mathsson. Bruno Mathsson. I have one as well. Mm hmm. Know how Bruno Mathsson shaped that chair? - No. - No? You? He sat down in a snowdrift, and then he shaped it based on his ass. Get the fuck out of here. What? Well, take a look. It's a perfect butt. Bullshit. He's fucking lying. How do you know that? No, but seriously, I have actually collected a lot of pretty things that people have just left during the war. And when all this is over, I'd like to open a little antiques shop. I thought he was going to be... What was it? A hockey pro? Ah. I got it. - So you're like a thief? - A scavenger. Fucking bullshit. He's a fucking looter. After this skate, I don't even want to watch the Stanley Cup. Hey, what was this bread called? They're called scones. Have another. They're really good. Thanks. What the fuck happened? I don't know. - I got hit. - Are you okay? - Granvik? - I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you hurt? No, it's just a scratch. Hey! I'm good. Calling Lance Corporal Karimi. Come in, Karimi. F28 calling Lance Corporal Karimi. Come in, Karimi. Who is this? Over. Ahrén, Comms Unit Officer, F28. Identify yourselves. Over. What do you want with Karimi? Over. I'm his girlfriend. Over. Lance Corporal Karimi can't talk right now. But I'll let him know that you called. Thanks. What's your position? Over. So he didn't lie, then. We have no idea who that was. You heard yourself. F28 was bombed. You know exactly who it was. What difference does it make? Bring water and food. We leave in three minutes. Let's go. I'm sorry. Let me see. Damn it, you said it was just a scratch. You should see... You should see the other guy. - We have to stop the bleeding. - No, it's fine. - I said it's fine. - Malik, stop it. Cut it out! You need it yourself. Granvik, help me up. Give me my weapon. Pick it up. We're no crab, my friend. We're a serpent. How much morphine did you take? A snake. A snake. The snake that eats itself. And here comes the head of the snake. I found something. A few kilometers away. Can you make it? - A few kilometers? - Yes. - Good. - Good. Yeah, yeah. The end of the beginning... The beginning of the end. What? Granvik. Put him there. I went on one of these when I was a kid. I ate so much candy that I puked. Hey. Where should we go? What? We'll take the ship, you and me. Where should we go? It's okay. Come on, buddy. We have to be able to dream if we're to survive this. - Where should we go? - I just want to go home. We won't reach Ödö before dawn. No, not with him anyway. We can build a sled for him. And drag him like fucking dogs, you mean? That would take at least a week. What about the radio? - What if we call someone? - No, too risky. It's only us and the enemy out here. We have to get to Ödö as soon as possible. But we can't just leave him. We'll find a safe place for him. Give him food and water then send someone to get him later. - How long will that take? - Don't know. Calm down! Okay, we have to secure the ship. Edh, get up as high as you can, and try to find out where we are. I'll take the car decks. And then Granvik... - I want to know what's in them. - Put down the capsule. Put down the capsule. Put down the capsule! Are you going to shoot me? Granvik, put it down. - Hey! - Granvik! What is it? It's... it's a virus. A biological weapon. Careful. Careful. Raad told us what it is. Give it to me. "The end of the war." It's not the end of the war. It's the end of everything. Everything... Granvik. We have to secure the ship. Let's go. I'm all right, buddy. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm staying here. Go. I'm safe here. I'll be right back. Get your shit together. Oh, fuck! Malik didn't want to go to Ödö anymore. I don't want to either. I saw lights on the ice. If they heard the shot, they'll be here in a few minutes. Everybody just keeps dying and nobody cares. You don't even fucking care that Malik killed himself. What the hell do you think? What are you doing? You guys can stay if you want, but I'm going. I'm not going to die on this boat. Edh! Fuck! Shit... No! Edh! Wait, stop! Stop! The ice won't hold. Stay back! Throw me a line! Give me the capsules. Throw me a line! Granvik, throw her a line. Ready? Okay. Can we go around? No. It goes on and on. We have to cross. Wait. Lie down. Calm down. Let's pull him in. I got you. I've got you. We're good. Down! Shh! - They're not shooting at us. - Shh. Keep moving. Come on. Crawl! Get down! Granvik! Can you take them out? Edh. Get ready to secure. Copy. - There's one target as far as I can see. - Good. Distance... 450 meters. Go 12 up. Four to the left. Fire when ready. Fire, Granvik! Fire! Fire! Fire! Edh? So the one I shot was the only one still alive? Mm. The other two had already frozen to death. Do you think they'll find Malik like that? Frozen to death. Or will the rats eat him first? I was in a mass grave... next to... I don't even remember his name anymore. We went to kindergarten together. Now half of his face was blown off. The enemy had forced us to dig it ourselves. And when we were done, they started shooting. He dragged me with him when he fell, so... They kind of didn't notice I wasn't hit. It must've taken me hours to get out from under all those bodies. And that's when I saw the rats. So many of them. I guess they could smell the corpses. Two days later I enlisted. And now we're just like them. Or I don't know, with this shit we're carrying, I guess we're worse. Aren't we? We just do what we're told. We follow orders. We're almost there. Then we don't need to think about it anymore. It's not our problem. Whatever I say, you only think about how you can convince us to continue. Yeah. Why is it so important for you to get to Ödö? Now... when you know what's in the capsules? You two sleep. We'll continue onto Ödö before dawn. Hm. Mom. Mom! You have to wake up. They're coming. Mom? They're coming. Wake up! Nylund left with the capsule. Grenade, then rifle. Okay? - How many? - At least ten. About 50 meters from here. I see two at ten o'clock. Get them? I don't know. - One more grenade. - Okay. Edh! One at nine o'clock! Mag! Mag! Shoot. One, two. Shoot! I'm going again. - It's my last five rounds, Edh. - Any grenades? One. - Ready? - Yes. Help! - Are you hit? - Grenade! No! No. Nylund! Stop! Give me the capsules! Nylund! Stop! Wait! Don't shoot. - Don't shoot. - Give me the capsules. - We have to destroy them. - Give me the capsules! We'll throw them in the ocean. Here. It's open ocean here. - We'll throw them... - Turn over! Edh... Edh... Edh. If the virus spreads with the refugee flows, millions of people will die, while Raad and the others hide away in their bunkers. Let me go! Edh! Listen to me. It's not a weapon against the enemy. It's a weapon against us all. It's the end of everything! Edh! Destroy the capsules! Edh. Mom? Mom? Hello? Van... Vanja? Hello? It's the end of everything. You left me under the ice. I have to keep going. Look, Vanja. Horses. Black... Black... Crab. Be still and quiet, okay? Look at me. Do you understand? Do not make a sound, okay? Okay. Look at me. Okay. Let's count to ten together. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... Shh. Shh. Six, seven, eight... Don't make a sound. Shh. Stay still. Shh. - Out! - No! - Mommy! - No! Vanja! Mom! - I'm sorry! - No! Let go! No! Let go! Sorry! Mom! I'm sorry. Vanja... Vanja... No. Careful. I'm only here to help you, Caroline. Okay? You were in really bad shape when they found you. Easy. - Where am I? - You're on Ödö. Has no one told you that? Easy now. Take it easy. - Have you seen my daughter? - Just try to relax. You have a gunshot wound to your belly, and we had to amputate three toes. So just take it easy. They want to see you as soon as possible. Okay? They? Who are they? Caroline Edh. Tessenöy to Ödö on ice skates. Impressive. And with that, the first step of Black Crab has been taken. Without your efforts, we wouldn't be here now. Ready to strike back on our way towards crushing the enemy. You're being promoted to Second Lieutenant. The National Medal of Courage. And... the Medal of Honor. But where's my daughter? Va... Vanja? Raad said she was here. I'm... I'm ready to see her now. - We'll discuss it later. - No. Now. I want to see her now. You needed all the motivation you could get out there. That hope brought you all the way here. What? - What did you say? - I'm sorry, Edh. But your daughter... has never been here. Where is she? Where is my daughter? - Help the admiral. - Admiral, are you okay? - No! - They will kill you. - Hey! It's okay. - Where's my baby? Calm down. Where's my baby? Where's my child? Where's my baby? Vanja... It's okay. It's okay. Where's my child? Where's my child? Okay. I'll make sure you get something strong for the pain as well so it won't hurt as much. You really need to get some rest. Let your body heal. Otherwise, you might lose your fingers as well, you know. There we go. All done. You were right. We have to destroy it. It's a little late to want to save the world now, Edh. Too late. We had our chance on the ice. Have they released it? The virus. Not yet. They'll mix the various components. Prepare it. And weaponize it. We can't let them release it. Do you have a plan? You're injured. You have no weapons. You have nothing. I have this. I mean, they think we're fucking heroes. Who's gonna stop us? Who's gonna stop us? Two invalids against a whole fucking army? What do you have to lose? Huh? Where will you go when they release it? Edh... All the people out there... It's too late. If Vanja... If Vanja is still alive... Destroying the virus is the only thing I can do to protect her. Do you know where the lab is? No. - Lance Corporal. - Yes. - "Yes, Captain." - Yes, Captain. Show us the way to the laboratory. - Uh, Captain... - Hey! Do I need to repeat myself? - No, Captain, it's just... - Good, escort us there. Yes, Captain. - What floor? - Five. Uh, Captain, your access card. You need it. Oh. Thank you, Lance Corporal. At ease. Are you okay? Edh... - Have you heard anything about them? - No. Okay, let's check. Captain. - You don't have access here. - Do you know who we are? I'm well aware of who you are. Please turn around and go to your floor. Your name and rank, please. Captain, I have my orders. What's your name? Okay, call it in and check. This is level five secur... - On the floor! On your knees! - Lose the masks! - Where's the virus? - What? Where are the capsules that came across the ice? - In there. - Shut up! Answer me! No, never. Ow! Oh! I'll show you. Stand up. Turn around. - Walk slowly. - Don't do it! - Come on! - Don't do it! - Don't... - Quiet! - Shut up! - Traitor! You traitor! Traitor! Where are we going? Just up there. Come on! Back up! Get back! Back! Stay there. Come on. Come on. Come on. Right now. Shit! They're coming! They're coming! Okay. Let's blow it up now. We have five seconds. - Ready? - No! Hey! If you detonate it in here you'll infect the whole base. You must get out! Away from people. How? How do we get out? - Huh? - Answer him! The alarm! The evacuation alarm. Take off your suits. Come on! Take off your suits. Evacuation of base. All personnel must move immediately to the hangar platform. Come on. Everyone out! All right. Let's go. A few more. - How much farther is it? - Two more floors. - I think my stitches have torn. - Okay. Evacuation of base. All personnel must move immediately to the hangar platform. I'm sorry. I should have realized. They lie about everything. They lied about Vanja, freedom... The only way to be free in this fucking war is to refuse to follow their orders. - Refuse to do as they say. - Yes. Come on. Let's go. Come on. What are you doing? - Are you deaf? Get up to the hangar. - Of course. We're going. She just fell. Move it! Evacuation of base. All personnel must move immediately to the hangar platform. You go. I'll be right behind you. No, I'm not going. We're going together. Find a seat on the helicopter! Just go. You stubborn bastard. I'll find us seats. - Do you have room for two more? - What? She's injured. She needs a seat. - She needs medical attention. - I have to see ID. We've found her. To the left of Gate 10. Over. Stay there! Don't move. Hands in the air! Where are they, Edh? Where are the capsules? - Get back! Grenade! Get back! - Get back! Back off! We need to go now! We have to take off. Come on. Don't do this, Edh. Secure the grenade. The war will end. That's all we want. You'll get a chance to start anew. A short transition period and then it's over. But first everything has to end, right? We're on the same side, Edh. Edh! Edh! Edh! You don't want to do this, Edh! Think about your daughter! That's all I ever do.
