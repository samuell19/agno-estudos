- Come on, kid. Man up, dude. There we go. Wes? - Hey, Paul. - So, the L1 deal is closing and the partners are flying into San Francisco. - Okay. - I hate to do this to you, but you're the only one I trust with this client. I need you out there. - Okay. Look, Wes, man to man, okay? Are you gonna be able to handle this? - Yes. Why wouldn't I? I have a good handle on the account. We'll be fine, Paul. We'll be fine. - Good. Hi, honey, make sure to pick up some cured meats. And we're low on diapers. Oh, and I need tampons too. Go to Whole Foods for the meats, don't go to Giant. So, you'll have to make two stops. And you know what? You mind just getting everything for the week? I'll text you the list. Sweetie, sorry, I forgot to add something to the list. Do you mind? Did you leave already? - I did, yeah. What is it? So my father just reminded me he needs his toilet paper. Speaking of, they're hungry and I want to try to put Lizzie down before my sister and Andy show up. So I'm just gonna serve everyone. But I have your plate ready. I'll keep it covered, okay? Okay. I'll take care of it. So, I said, "I am not going out like that. You know I'm not going out." - Wes, oh, my God. I'm sorry, honey. We wanted to wait for you, but we were starving. - You did remember the diapers, did you? - Yeah. Oh, I think I left them in the car. - I'll get 'em. This isn't one-ply, is it? You got to do something about that dishwasher. It just crapped out. - Hah! Hmm. You've reached Luke. Leave a message. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. - Hey, man, I don't know why I've had so much trouble reaching you for the past month. Maybe you've been arrested? Kidnapped? Maybe you're dead? I don't really give a fuck. You should call me back. But hopefully, you're out there in that cesspool of silicone, serving up manhood in a more efficient manner than I am here in suburbia, where I am house dad to not only my wife and kid but also my in-laws. One of whom just told me I need to get a bigger fucking house so that he has more bathrooms to shit in and more room to put his feet up. Anyway, I won't be mad about the hiding if you show up at this reunion, okay? I've been drinking. Bye. ? Twinkle twinkle little star ? Yeah, you're tired. ? How I wonder what you are? ? It's eczema, not a skin rash. Make sure you tell the doctor. - Fuck, is this what I think it is? - His ass? Yeah. - Great. Thank you, honey. Can't unsee that. Oh. And here's the bill from last time. That needs to be paid. Make sure they don't overcharge you. - Goddamn! A thousand dollars? To treat skin on an old man's ass? - What do you want me to say? It's my dad. All right. - Oh shit. Wes? - Hmm-mm. - Look at me. - Hmm? - I'm ovulating. - Okay. - Take your pants off. Wait, okay. No-- Does that hurt? - No, it's-- it-- it's good. It's fine. - Okay. - Just go ahead. - All right. - Okay. You reached Luke. Leave a message. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. You know, a month ago, we sat here on the phone while I bought you a plane ticket to this reunion. And you kind of laughed it off at the time, but you promised me you'd come. So, hopefully, you are coasting comfortably at 30,000 feet, on a red-eye right now. I'm really looking forward to seeing you, bud. Could use a talk. Wes! - Holy shit! Steve! How are you, bud? - How the hell you been, man? - I'm good. I'm good. You? - Well. Can't complain. Still in Philly, workin'. - Very nice. - My wife and I just had a little one. - Congrats, man. - Yeah. A baby boy. And-- - That's great. - Yeah, thanks. It's... - Yeah. - How about-- how about you? I heard you and Sarah Joyce ended up getting married? - We did. - I could've said that would happen. You two. You always had a Ken and Barbie thing goin' on. - Here's your drink, darling. - Thank you, my dearest. - Hmm. Who'd have thought I could be so thoughtful? - I know, seriously. - Hmm. - What did you do with my wife? I don't know. - I'll let you know if I find her though. - Thank you so much. She has my credit cards. - Is that Maggie Olson? It is. Is she comin' over here? - I wish Luke was here. How much did you pay for those tickets? - This is gonna be interesting. - Hi, Sarah. Hey, Wes. - Hey, Maggie. - Maggie, you look beautiful. Thank you. I-I hear you guys got married. - We did. Got married seven years ago. - Hmm-mm. - Not that anyone's counting. - No. - No. - He's-- - Feels like yesterday. Yeah. - Still that "angry old man-baby" that I just tolerate, so not much has changed. - What about you? - No, not married. Still single. - Got it. Where are you now? - I live up in Portland, Oregon. - Oh nice. - Nice. - Yeah, I really love it. - What are you doin' up there? - I'm a painter. Which means I spend most of my time bartending. - Hey, beats my concrete jungle. - Um... Is Luke here? - No. H-he didn't make it. - It's too bad. Tell him I said hello. - I'm gonna take a couple of days off on either side of the meeting. Get out west early. You have nothing to worry about, okay? Nothin's gonna jeopardize the deal. I just need some time. - Why don't we try this? I'll-I'll ramp right before his first chorus line on the beat. And then we'll intercut that motif through the rest of the chorus. Here, watch. - ? Rewind rewind it Rewind-- ? - Oh fuck! Yes! Yes! There's it! The fucking GENIUS. Right there, the fucking GENIUS! You did that in your sleep, like a fucking Jedi. Why can't Harold do that? - Well, you better get Harold to shape up, because we can't afford to keep asking Luke to save the day from his apartment. Speaking of... Luke... So we are over budget again. But we can still pay you. It's just a fraction of the rate for the hours you've put in. I'm sorry. - You know what? Don't worry about it. I'll just... consider it my goodbye present. - Whatcha talking about? I'll keep a spot open for you in case you change your mind at the last minute. - Change your mind about what? Wes? - Okay. We should go. Yeah, we're gonna project all these wacky beams of light in all different directions. Like green, purple, yellow, orange, red-- like a prism, you know? - Cool. - Yeah. Sure. Right? I'm gonna put Beyonce in a TransAm. So it'll be like Beyonce, meets Knight Rider, meets Dark Side of the Moon. - Hmm. - Are you at CAA? - No. I-I'll call you. - Come here, buddy. - What the fuck are you doing here, Wes? - You don't answer your goddamn phone, so I'm takin' matters into my own hands. It's a nice spot. About 700 square feet? - Wes, what the fuck is goin' on? She's in Portland. - What? Who? - Maggie. What? Maggie who? - Your Maggie. - What? My-my Maggie? - Yeah. So, guess what? We're going to Portland! What?! - Yeah. We're gonna drive up to Portland and we're gonna go see Maggie. Well, you're gonna go see Maggie. And I'm just gonna stand to the side... happily. In the bushes or something. - You're out of your fucking mind. She was at the reunion and she was asking about you. - She was-- she was asking about me? - And I'm telling you, it felt like the sole reason she was there was to see you. And I've got business up in San Francisco. We'll kill two birds with one stone. And where are you goin'? - I'm showering. I'm hungry. Hurry up. - Calm down. - Thank you for getting my luggage. Very helpful after a long flight. You realize how long of a drive it is to Portland? - Yeah. It's 570 miles from Santa Monica Pier to Leggett. That's 15 hours of driving. I figure we cut in at Lincoln City. Then from Leggett to Portland, is 520 miles, 11 hours of driving. So what? We're talking 1,100 miles, 26 hours of driving. - Even if we do manage to get there, how do we even find her? - Well, I've done some digging. She works in this cool place up at Belmont. I know where she lives, too. You're starting to scare me. - You have wife clearance for this? Yeah, Sarah's totally fine with it. - Yeah, right. Speaking of, how is-- how's Lizzie? - Oh, c'mon. What else do you have to do? You can't move home. What the fuck are you gonna do in Richmond?! - Well, my brother got me a sales job. - No. - Waste disposal. - No. - Recycling. - Still no. Are you kidding me?! That is not a solution. I'm not lettin' you do that. - Shh, you-you reach a certain age, and being broke is just - is a bad look. It-it gets old trailing behind everyone else. - Since when do you care about everyone else? Listen, whenever I get frustrated with my own life... I think about you. I do. Out here living for us all. That's just the truth, man. Can you handle that? - You can stay at my place until your meeting. I'll take you out here in LA every night. We'll have a blast, but I'm not going to Portland. - Like the first part. Hate the second part. We'll go to Portland. Oh! I oughta grow out my beard on this trip. Nice fuckin' thick beard, it's what these LA chicks like, right? Buy a flannel. God knows I walk into someplace with a blazer, they think I'm their fuckin' dad. - Ts-ss. - But I diss the blazer and buy a flannel. Grow out my nice thick beard, and I'll look just like the rest of these dirty idiots with their flannels and beards. What? Your little Bukowski shtick seems to be workin' out just fine. C'mon, you've gotten more ass out here than you ever did in college by a multiple of a hundred. - Yeah. Okay. Who cares? I'm done. - What does that mean? - I'm-- I'm taking a break from women. - Uh-- what? - Look, you won't understand. - No, I can't say I would understand. 'Cause absolutely nothing about a good-looking, single guy in LA taking some vow of celibacy, makes any sense to me, whatsoever. - Well, I'm-I'm tired. - What? - I haven't had sex with a girl in six months. And quite frankly, I haven't wanted to. - What is goin' on here? What have you done with my friend, Luke, huh? You don't return your calls. I buy you a ticket, you don't fly out. What's the deal? - Look, uh... you're not here. You don't know what it's like. And-- sorry. I'm sorry about the ticket. - No, fuck the ticket! I just want to know what's going on?! - I'm fine. - Wow. Look at that! Look at this jewel. It's pure Cali right there. Oh, man! You know, being here in this moment, it just makes me really, really happy that places like this still exist. What? Hey-hey. Oh,. You know I really liked you. I did. - Ah. - And you're just an a-, he's such an asshole. Why were you so mean to me? - I wasn't mean to you. N-- I-I wasn't mean to her. - You-- yeah, you were. I thought you were a nice guy. But you just ended up being a jerk. - Makes a lot of sense. - He ended up being a jerk. - I totally get that, and I'm sorry. - Do you just want to go home? Please? Alright. Mallory, we're going home. - Do you want to go home? - It's-it's time to go. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm just staying right there. - Yeah, I'll um-um I'll-I'll- I'll catch you later. - Maybe-maybe I'm gonna be over here. - Yeah. - I'm over-- - Catch you later. - Bye. Okay. I just-- okay. - Oh, wow. Luke, what did you do to that poor woman? No, I didn't do anything. Okay, we were kinda hookin' up for a while. And one night, she just starts crying randomly, for no reason. I couldn't get it out of her. She wasn't even drunk. And then, later that night, I'm sleeping and she-she tried to stick her finger up my ass. - Oh. That might've done it for me. Of course, it would. S-so now I'm the asshole and-- me, asshole forever. - Uh-oh. Look at this. Come on, you can't leave her like that. Hmm-mm. Hi. - Hi. A-- oh! Ah! What? - Oh, your-your breath from the-- - What? - The vomit. - So fuckin' typical of this city. - Look, I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm sorry. You're a fuckin' loser. - Hey, hey, hey, just take it easy, alright? I took care of you all night. - Hey, hey, no. You're a nobody. It's no wonder why you're 30-something alone in a one-bedroom guesthouse with nobody but a fuckin' douchebag in a fuckin' robe. You know, I just feel bad for guys like you because you'll never have the capacity to get your shit together to bring somebody in. - You know what? I'll-- I'll consider the source. Thank you. - Oh my God, that is such a fucking clich?! A 30-something-year-old dreamer equals a fucking loser! Loser! Fuck! Fuck! I just think it's time I settle into something elsewhere. - Luke, no. That blackhole or whatever that shit was in there, that's why we got to go to Portland. - Oh, will you stop with the Maggie stuff, please? - No, Luke, I get it now. I do. Your career right now, it sucks. I see that. You're not happy. You haven't accomplished what you want and that sucks. But you just need some positive momentum, and if you get your ass up that PCH with me-- yes, that's that one step. That's that one fucking step in the right direction. And I promise you, the momentum's gonna start to turn in your favor. - Okay. - Fuck, yeah. Pack your shit. We leave in an hour. Pack your shit. - Where-where you're going? Bring a jacket. And bring something nice, please? - Wait-wait, where you goin'? - We're going on a little college tour. - Wait, what? Really? - Why not? We both look professorial! Me more than you, but we'll be fine. Now tell me, Luke, you got shit. I got shit. We're both in it. But-- You gotta admit, man, it feels pretty good to be back around this, huh? Just look around. And do this for me. Close your eyes and sniff. What do you smell? - I smell ocean air. Maybe a little beer. - Yeah. - Some dog shit. - Little bit, yeah. Now, is that-- is that strawberry lotion? You've always been a sick fuck. - What? Man, we're back. We're here, right? Oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, she's lookin' at you. Did you learn nothin' last night? - No, this is different. More wholesome. Say somethin'. The first thing that pops into your head. Go, go, go! - Hey. Umm... Do you know where we can get some-some smoothies around here? Smoothies? Umm... Yeah. Yeah, there's a smoothie place called 'Blenders' back on Pardall. - Cool. - Great. Yeah, thank you. - Yeah. - Welcome to I.V.! - You just asked her where to get some smoothies?! - I believe I did. - Yeah. Odd exchange. - ? I said we're all gonna die ? ? But I'll never believe it ? ? I love this world And I don't wanna leave it ? ? Said that death is a deal ? ? That you cannot refuse ? ? But I love you girl And I don't wanna lose you ? ? Don't want a long ride ? ? I don't wanna die at all ? ? I wanna be the man Who lives forever ? ? I ain't never gonna die And I want you to come ? ? Whoo ooh ? ? Whoo ooh ? ? Whoo ooh ? ? Whoo ooh ? ? I said life is a tale It begins and it ends ? - Alright. Pay attention. You may learn something. You surfer pansies need to put a little hair on your chest. So we're gonna drink some aged distilled grain like men. There we go. To surfin' dudes with attitudes. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Okay. Okay. Here we go, boss. - Hey-- - Yeah! - Come here. - Alright. One second, yes? - Oh! Lookie here! - Oh, my God. - The smoothie guys. - You know this crew? - Oh, not too well, but it's just how people do it in I.V. - Yeah, it's an open-door policy around here. You come in, you party. If you enter, you gotta live it up. - Live it up! I.V. Baby! - Yhoo! - A couple parties down the street are gonna rage later. - Yeah? - Hmm-mm. - We're in. Let's go! - No, no, no, no, no. - This is-- this is just our speed. - No, no. This is not just our speed. - We need more speed. Okay. - You guys are funny. What's your story? - On a road trip. Headin' up Highway 1 to Portland. - Ah, that's sweeeeet. Portland's so chill. - Wait? If you're going to Portland, you going up the Coast through Big Sur? - You bet your sweet little ass we are! I-is not what I meant to say. Yes, we are. I'm not a sexist pig. I promise. I just noticed earlier that you are-- um, have a-a-- yeah-yeah, things are going well in that area. Yeah. She does have a cute little bubble butt, doesn't she? She does. - Well, we're trying to meet some friends up there, but we need a ride. - Is that so? Alright, well hey, you show us some fun tonight, we'll get you where you need to go. - Us?! Fun?! Oh, that's-- - It's not gonna b- No? Roblem. - Hmm-mm. - We bring all the fun. Phh. - Ah-oh, whoa. No thanks. Never touched the stuff. - Wow, never? I don't do mellow. I'm a grown man, I drink scotch. - Bullshit, that's not the reason. - What? - It's because when he used to smoke back in college, he'd turn into this paranoid mess. - No. That is not true. I once had to cradle him. He thought he was an orange. And he-he was afraid he was gonna get peeled. - That-- the orange incident did happen. - Well, you'll just have to fare with the boxed wine in the fridge. - Of course, you have boxed wine, because you're a classy lady. Yes. Thank you. Excuse me. - You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. I don't bite. - Sold. Hmm. - I'm gonna smoke a little ganja. - Oh, thank you very much. - Hmm-mm. - Oh, it says refreshing on the box. This is exciting. Very cool, Snoop. - You should take a rip! And just go be paranoid in the corner. - Yeah, what's your deal, Wes? You look like a very slick banker guy. Are you from New York? - Close. D.C. area. - Hmm. I bet your closet's full of Brooks Brothers. - No. No. No, no, no. Brooks Brothers is entry level shit. Most of my shirts are from Geneva. Oh. - Just the supple cotton is better for my chest hairs. All four of them? - Wes makes a lot of money in venture capital. - Nah, I make a lot of money being super boring. - And what do you do? Work at Smoothie King? - A, well um-- - Luke edits music videos in LA. - Oh, wow! That's so cool! - Yeah. - Yeah. So cool. - He is not super boring! Well, you know, my mom always says that you can't make a "life" unless you do what makes you happy. - God bless your mother. I'm guessing she's a super-hot yogi milf. She sure is! I knew I was right. So what's in Portland? - Good question, Constance. I'll answer it. I happen to have run into one of Luke's college pals and she inspired this little journey up the coast. - Oh. - There's a girl up in Portland, and you guys are going to see her? Was it an old college girlfriend? - It's a love quest. - Hmm-mm. - No, it's not a love quest. - It's a love quest. - It's a fuckin' love quest. It is. - Yeah, I highly doubt that. - Yeah, don't pay too much attention. This guy over here is probably already in love with you. And fun fact, he's gonna kill me for saying this, but Luke here has the largest collection of romantic films this si ssippi. I caught him on multiple occasions jerking off to Notting Hill in college. You-- - Hugh Grant's sexy. - You can't-- you can't unsee that. Well, that is adorable. So VHS or laserdisc? - It's a poster. Oh. Okay. - You two have fun. - You two have fun. Not too much "fun". - Hmm. So, did I do my job this evening? - Yes, you did. You have earned your free ride. Yes. - Ah. - Come on. - What? - Dance with me. Oh. More dancing. - Hmm. - Wonderful. - Tell me something about you? That only some random college girl would know. Tell me a secret. Make it ours. Well, believe it or not, this is one of the happier days I've had in a very long time. - Hmm. This day isn't even over yet. Hmm. - Hello? - Hey honey, it's me. Wes? What time is it? - Well, almost six your time. - Hmm. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Everything's fine. Just couldn't sleep. How's Lizzie? Hmm. She's good. She misses her Daddy. Yeah. I miss her too. Alright. Go back to bed. I'll call you later. - Hmm. I love you. - I love you too. Hmm. - So, Wes, I heard you're married? Might explain why I didn't get any last night, huh, buddy? Oh, and you have a kid. That's so cute! She is. Would be very proud of me right now. - ? Feel it in my bones ? - ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Something that I can't hide ? ? Put your hands in the sky ? ? Love will make you feel high ? ? Love will make you Feel alive ? ? Feel it in my bones ? ? Feel it in my bones ? - I literally have chills right now. - I told you. It's magical. - I just want to look at this and remember it. Okay. We're good. Mental snapshot in my brain forever. And what's it like being married to someone you met when you were 19? It feels kind of old fashioned these days. - That's me. Just an old 60's Chevy. - The-the Bronco suits you better. - When you're young, your heart is so big. It's just racing to let in every opportunity... every feeling. Everything. But-- you don't really know who you are at 19. I mean, don't you love getting to be creative all day? Plus, why go and leave all this behind? - Well, what? Should I come live with you? - You'd do that? - Sure. Why not? I can totally see myself with you. - Oh yeah? So, you'd just dive in with some "enchanting" college girl you met like 12 hours ago? - You. Me. Here. I can paint any beautiful delusion for our future. - See? You really are romantic. ? This life of ? ? Darlin' darlin' darling You're my song ? Whoah! - ? Darling you're my song ? - Hmm. - What the fuck? - Hmm. What's goin' on, baby? - Hey guys, this is Charlie and Sev. - Hello. - Charlie. What's up, brothers? Thanks for giving the goddesses a ride. - Sure. Yeah. - Beats an Uber. - Yeah. You guys should come with us. We're going to grill some fresh Ahi, smoke some green grasses. Gonna camp out. Join us. - Yeah. No. Ah, thank you, though. - Yeah, we'll take a raincheck on the tuna. Gotta get goin'. - Okay. Chill! Well, safe journey. Very great to meet you bros. Prosper. - Likewise. - And if you brothers change your mind, you know, we got extra tents and good vibes. Ganja, goddesses. I don't think we will. - Yeah. Unlikely, but thank you for the uh-- for the offer. - Nice to meet you, dudes. - Hmm-mm. Absolutely. Yeah. - Thank you. Pleasure. What? - Ah, I don't know. Don't you think a little heads-up would have been in order? - No. Why? I'm not his property. I'm no one's and everyone's. Through me. - That doesn't mean anything. - I just listen to my energy and I follow it, Luke. Don't do anything else. Do you. - I'll keep that in mind. - Well... Hmm. - Hmm. - Hmm. I hope you find more happy days, old fashioned. - Thank you. - Go get her. - Okay. Can we just acknowledge something for a second? That was a great moment. Whether or not they're down there with Johnny Dipshit and the German sociopath. You had fun, I can see it on your face. - I guess I just thought we were destined to run off into the sunset or something. Until Bodhi from Point Break showed up. - Ah, well, whatever. We had fun. - Yeah. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. - Ah, nothing should surprise me anymore. - Well... I feel renewed. - Do ya? You look renewed. - I invite you to join me on this side of a good mood. - Give me a minute, I'll be right there. How many necklaces does that guy have on? Hey. Hey. - Get up. - What? Got us a tee time. Spanish Bay, baby. - I hate golf. - No, you don't. Come on. Get up. - I fuckin' suck at it. - That's fine. I'll beat you. Be good for my ego. Get up. Luke, it's your brother, Phil. Give me a buzz when you get a chance to chat about the job we talked about. Good news is, if you don't screw it up, they'll probably hire you on the spot. Bad news is, the meeting is now Monday morning. I know it's last minute, but you gotta figure out a way to get on an airplane and get out here. Whatever the damage is, we'll figure it out between Dad and I when you get back. Alright, man, give me a call when you get a chance. - Who was that? You really got to leave Monday? For what? For the chance to go sell trash in Richmond? - I just-- I got to do this. - You're meant to go to Portland. - Alright. You sink that putt, I'll stay. - Game on. - Well... that's it, I guess. What's wrong? What do you mean? I can tell by the tone of your voice something's wrong. What's wrong? There's this guy I'm working with. Can't really talk specifics, but I think he's makin' a big mistake. Can you get him to change his mind? I'm tryin', but he's a stubborn one. Well, you've been known to have the power of persuasion. Yeah, well, we'll see. I got to get goin'. Kiss Lizzie for me, and I love you. Love you. Bye. You really would have stayed if I'd made that putt? - You'll never know. Oh, God. - You know what this night needs, Luke? More company. - Oh, come on, Wes. It's our last night. Let's just hang together. - No. Ladies, how's the wine? - Not bad. - Can't complain. - Yeah? You-you visiting from out of town? - No, I live here in Carmel. She's in town visiting from Berkeley. - Cool. I'm Wes. - Rebecca. - Ellen. - Very good to meet you. I don't mean to be a creep, but do you see this scruffy guy, over here? Hmm-mm. This guy is a dear friend of mine, and a troubled-- a troubled man, and um, here's the deal. Here's what I think we should do. The four of us should go to dinner. Some good food, some adult conversations. A couple of drinks, maybe several drinks. Just take some time to remind ourselves of life's joys and in so doing, we can help this poor Sad Sack over here realize that he's making the biggest mistake of his entire life. Please? He's a grouch. - Well, maybe he's not as hopeless as you say he is. Maybe he's just searching for something more. - Maybe he hasn't found the one? Maybe she's in Portland? - Hmm. - There we go. - What does that even mean? The one? No, at-at this point in life, I think it's more a matter of practicality. I've given up on this notion that somehow, I'll just run into someone and know that she's the one. And that's-- that's fine. It's totally fine with me. - Seems a little defeatist to me. - Agree. - No, it's-- it's just not worth it anymore. It's not. - Dating to eventually find the right one, how is that not worth it? - Okay, so take Ellen and I, for example. We could totally go back to some hotel room and um, sleep together. - Hmm. - Hmm. - Mm. But come morning, either of us could wake up feeling nothin' but-- but total emptiness. And just really wanting to find the quickest way out the door. All for what? A couple of hours of pleasure? - Or we could end up dating. And then, after a few months-- good months, where our feet never touch the floor-- Maybe we don't want to invest in this, you know? How much do we want to invest in this thing-- - Yeah. - --That's taken time away from meeting someone else? Maybe I decide that I wanna move on. - Well-- - Only to realize of course that, "Oh no, that was really great." - Or maybe I'm the one agonizing-- --over my exit strategy because I'm-- I'm somehow riddled with all this guilt over telling you that, "I'm really sorry, but this isn't gonna happen after all." - Oh! So I'm left there wondering-- --did I mismanage my emotions when I was with you? If I had done this or that differently-- - Agh! Yes. - --Would you have left me?! - The pining is the fucking worst! It's true. - It's pretty fucking awful. - Yeah. So why not just stick yourself in a foxhole with someone we're comfortable with, who cares for you, fulfills all your daily needs-- - Hmm. - --Even though you're not entirely sure that they're the one. - Wow. You two are clearly meant to be together. Best of luck to both of you-- - Thank you. - --On that tragic journey. Rebecca, how about you? - Ha. Uh... Well... it's complicated. - Oh! Sure. It's all complicated, right? - To be honest... um... This mornin', I signed my divorce papers. - Sorry to hear that. - It's okay. Actually... it feels good to say it. Yeah. I'm divorced. - There you go. - Hmm. - It's why I came down. Just to give her some support when she officially closed the chapter. Look at the sunset, have a drink. Think about a new chapter. Come on. To a new beginning. - What about you, Wes? - Uhm. Well... I'm married. - Hmm. - We have a baby girl. She's-- actually, she's almost two now. - How long have you been married? - Uh, going on seven years. Though, most days, it feels like a little longer. So, I hear ya. Sharing your life is complicated. - Hmm. - Let's get some air. - Yeah. - A little walk around Carmel? - Did I bring us down that much? A little bit. Yeah. - Where are you guys staying? - We don't have a hotel yet. - Oh well, then you're staying with her. - Oh, no. We'll find a place. - Yeah, come on. No, stay with us. She's got a full bar. Wine for days. You gotta help this divorcee who doesn't wanna go to sleep yet. - We're grown men, we can handle ourselves. - Ah-uh. You're staying. - No, the two of you should stay with us. It's a-- it's fine. Plenty of room. Were you ever married? - No. Almost. But no. Almost? What happened? - He wanted kids. - Wait? And you didn't? - No. - Wow. - I'm sorry, are we in 1952? And I need to put on-- - my little apron and do some vacuuming around the house? - I'm-I'm sorry. I guess I just-- I guess I just have this idea that deep down, every woman wants to be a mother and raise a family. - No. Not me. - How old are your kids? - Jesse's 11, and Caroline is nine. - How often do they see their dad? - Every other weekend. We share custody. He's up in Palo Alto. - How's that been? - Um, you can't prepare for this kind of stuff. - Did I trade getting married for living a life of my own? Sure. But... you know, he's married now. He has his kids. I don't regret my path at all. Definitely not boring, I'll tell you that. That's kind of the point. Isn't it? - All right, big question for Luke. Tell me about this Maggie. What makes her so special? - The thing about Maggie-- - Oh, yeah, no. I'm not allowed? - I want Luke to say it. Yeah, come on. Give a newly divorced mom a little hope. - All right. Um... The first time I saw her was English class. She was sitting by the window as the sun was piercing in. You know, that classic awe moment, right. But there was an innocence about her that just struck me. And for whatever mystical reason, from that moment on, she was the girl I wanted. I remember I would walk by her on campus or I'd see her in the cafeteria, or at the library or at a party. And, and the more this happened, the more I began to create this romantic idea of something with her. I started to dream of us being together... without ever even saying much more than hello to one another. But, the more I did this, the harder it was to temper these really intense feelings I had for this girl to a point where I could actually connect with her like a human being, and not some angel I had built her up to be. - But did you actually connect with her? Uh-huh. The boat, tell them about the boat. - Oh, a boat. - What boat? - There's a boat. - My senior week, right before graduation, my parents had this bay house in Virginia. And I invited all these people from school to drive out there and crash for a few days. And somehow, Maggie and her friends heard about it, and surprisingly they showed up. - No, not surprisingly. They knew this was Luke's last chance. Will you get to the boat part, please? Alright, so, one afternoon, everyone was hanging out by the pool, and she came up to me, and asked if I would take her for a boat ride. I wanted every day to feel like that boat ride. I remember we docked the boat on this little man-made beach and we just sat there for hours and made up for all the lost time. We talked about our future, our dreams... and just what we wanted out of life. And for those couple hours-- she-- she made me feel all this... hope, like anything was possible. And then, I know it sounds crazy, but all these dreams of love and marriage flooded my mind. It was like I could look across... at this girl I barely knew... and I could see my wife. - Now, ladies, that is the guy I know. - But what happened between you? Anything? - Um, no. - What? - I had my chance, but... I was too afraid to ruin this perfect moment. So that night, she and her friends left. And graduation came. She moved to Europe, and I never saw her again. - Didn't you go after her? I mean, you loved her. Loved her? No, I didn't love her. I mean, I was infatuated. I might have felt in love, but-- - But-- See, but. Those-- those feelings, that story you just told us, it's all part of being in love. - Those are just feelings, it's not love. You two made it perfectly clear tonight that love is not something you-- you create in your mind, it's not a fairytale. It's a-it's a lot more complicated than that. - Well, hang on. - Oh, let me tell you something, Luke. If you think it's all worth it without the fairytale at least at some point in the relationship, then you're wrong. Maybe me signing those papers today is just more proof that this whole idea of marriage is a myth. But the fairytale that I had with that man in those first two years, that's the only reason we made it through another 15. And... to tell you the truth, those moments that you described, they still happen. They're just tinier fragments of... a life that just becomes bigger than the both of you. But it is those moments, Luke, that ground you, that anchor you in life. And no matter how far you sail away through all the pettiness, you need that stuff to bring you back to the why of it all. To help you with the myth. Because without it, there's nothing. Love is not some form of practicality, and you know that. You should go. You should go find her. I don't care how silly it is. Just open your heart back up to the possibility of something. You do owe yourself that. - To Portland. - To Portland. It would be good for you. If it doesn't work out, you can always find me in Berkeley. Are you sure you want to give up all this? Because corporate America is a far cry from this. You know that, right? - I know this isn't exactly what you had in mind, but thank you. - Don't go. - Look Wes, I appreciate everything you've done. And-- I feel better, I really do. - Just stay, please. It's not just you who needs this. - I have to do this, man. I'm sorry. - Fine, well, you're running late, so go. Go. Thank you for everything. Hey. Hey, hon, how are you? Just walking into this meeting now. I figured I'd give you a quick ring. You ready? Um... Well, I actually have some nerves. You nervous about a deal? It's a complicated one. I'm sure you'll do fine. People gravitate towards you. How's everything at home? How's our girl? She's fine. She won't stop moving. But that's nothing new. She got that from her mom. She certainly did. Let me know how it goes. Yeah, I will. Love you. I love you, too. - Thanks again. - Thank you very much. - Yup. Thank you, guys. - We'll talk again. - Wes, take care. Thank you. - Can I talk with you in my office? Oh, I missed you. Oh my God, I'm so glad it's the weekend. I have so many places I want to show you. But first, I've got us dinner reservations at this new spot. Uh, but then, there's this amazing overlook I found near my apartment. So we have to go do that. Uh, but there's also-- - Okay, uh, just... slow down. - Wes, what's wrong? You're a coward. - Come on. You don't want to start a life with a guy who would have an ex-wife and a child. - I don't care about that. - I love you. I do, but I don't want that for you. - Don't do that. Don't make this about me. I know what I want. I want you and you want me too, so don't make this about me. Why can't you do this for yourself? Why are you so afraid to be happy? I don't know. I never want to see you again. I'll forget I ever knew you. Hey. Hey, so it's 1:30 now. Sunset's not until 8:00. I figured we should be able to make it to Leggett before nigh. Wes? What are we doing? What's wrong, man? You haven't said a word in like five hours. - Just work stuff. - Let's just call it a night and double back to Fort Bragg. - Kind of want to power through. Highway 1 ends in like 22 miles. - Yeah, 22 miles of dicey roads in the middle of the woods. - Let's just keep going. - All right. Yeah, I bet it's the alternator. Why don't we get this thing into town, and get it fixed up first thing in the morning. I know a good shop. Where you guys headin'? - North. - What's the closest hotel at this point? - The closest hotel, all right, well... I know a funky little spot. - This place is kind of spooky. - All right. Well-- Sorry it's not the Chateau, Mr. Hollywood, but it will have to do. - You've been carrying all this cash around the whole time? - Yup. Been a cash-only kind of trip. Another Glen? - Uh-huh. Let's do a double. - Two Moscow mules. Hello. - Hello. - How's your dinner? - Just what I needed. Been a long day. - You visiting? - Our car broke down, so we're just-just staying the night. - Oh, well, that's a shame. - Well, it will be ready in the morning, so-- - I'm Charles. Hi. - Diedra. - Sage. - Sage, Diedra. Here, let me get those. Yup. - Thank you. - Oh, sorry, this is my business partner... Gary. - Gary. What kind of business? - Uh, oil business. Yeah, we are up... we're up here searching for some new prospects. - You drilling? - Sorry. - We are drilling. Uh-hmm. Why don't you join us for a drink when you're done with your dinner. You too, Gary. - Are you for real? Again? You're un-fucking-believable, man. Our car's going to be ready in the morning. Can we just sleep? - No one is forcing you to stay out late. - Come on, Wes, I'm here now for the endgame. You've got me, I'm in. We don't need any more detours. - Yeah, you don't need any more detours. I-- Just be quiet and let me do what I'm going to do. - That's not even a detour, it's just-- it's just a wrong turn. - Fine. Go to bed. - Gary thinks you're an asshole. How much do you love fucking? Don't you love fucking, Charlie? I love fucking. I'll take sex any moment, anytime. I don't know if it's my DNA, or something from my daddy's homemade porn videos. It was? What the fuck are you talking about? My daddy is fucked up. When I was 12, I found this old VHS tape in his bedroom. Of course I was curious. And I watched it. And I saw my stepmom in this old lit dark saloon, getting fucked by a bunch of men in gorilla masks. Guess who was behind the camera? Daddy. Uh-huh. There you go. That is enough daddy porn video talk. Let's make our own video. - Yeah. - You want to make a video, Charlie? Come on, you have too much clothes on. - Alright. - I'm going to do this all for the video. Where's your phone? - Yes. - Wait a sec. - Umm, look at the oilman's ass. That's a fucked-up story. Are we going to make it to Portland? - You should be okay, but... I'd get a proper check once there. My wife will get you squared away. - Oh, yeah, I'll have your bill in a sec. - Hey, babe, you good? - Yeah. - That was the-- - Alternator. - Yes. - And the check of the filter. - Yes, that's right. Okay. Love you. Um, I'll put the key in the-in the Bronco. - Thanks. - Hey, Rex, I'll follow you out. I've got a quick question. So, uh, if I turn my fan on-- - How long has it been? - Hmm? Aww! 51 years. - Wow! What's the secret? Oh! There's been a lot of... life since that photo. A lot of change. But with all that change... I guess it's about always working to find each other in the end. - That's beautiful. - Thank you. - All right. What's the damage? What do I owe ya? - It's not too bad. There you go. - Great. Fuck! Fuck! - Are you okay? - Ah, yeah. Sorry. Um, I, I've got some money in the car. I'll be back. - I might finally have some reception. Sarah called me. Why's your wife calling me, Wes? She left me a message. - Do, do not listen to that voicemail. - Oh, wait! She left me four fucking messages. Why, why do I have four fucking messages from your wife, Wes? - You know, just give me the phone! - No! - Just give me the fucking phone! Give me the phone. - Why? They're clearly for me. - Give me the goddamn phone! - What happened in San Francisco, Wes? You've been fucking dark ever since. Somethin' happened. The man with all the answers. And the one time I actually ask for one, you won't give it to me. Just be honest! - I was having a fucking affair! Okay? I fell in love with a woman from work. Are you happy now? But I ended it. I ended it. Because no matter how much I love her, I don't want to ruin my family. But I did not sleep with those women last night. They robbed me, okay? That's why I'm freaking out right now. They took my credit cards, my AMEX cards, and Sarah has access to my AMEX cards, and I'm sure she's seen the fraud charges and knows something's up. You're right. I'm supposed to have all the answers. You're the one guy that knows I don't. - Why didn't you tell me about it before? - You wouldn't answer the phone. Wes, where are you? The hotel in San Francisco says you never checked in. There's all these strange charges on the credit card. I don't know where you are, I don't know what's going on, I, you don't answer your phone. I don't care what's going on. I just need you to call me and let me know you're okay 'cause I'm kind of freaking out here. Call me please, okay? I love you. - Eventually, our boss got wind of the affair. And he couldn't allow things to move forward the way they were going. But he needed us both. Thank God. So he had Jennifer take over the San Francisco office... Left me in D.C. And um... for the past year, I've been living a double life with a woman across the country. - I should have picked up the phone. - No, man, it's okay. - No, no. I should've. I should have been there for you. I'm sorry. - You're here now. Jeez. I don't know what I'm doing. Fuck. I don't know. - Wes, look, man. I don't have a clue about marriage. I don't know what it's like. I'm just some single dude who's spent the majority of his adult life alone. So, who am I to give you advice, right? But what the fuck! You can't lie your way through the rest of your life. What's the point? You're just going to hurt people, people important to you. So just... just make a choice. And stick with it. We are reading to begin security screening for Flight 310 with service to Sacramento. At this time, if you'd gather your personal items and have your boarding pass and your photo ID out and available for myself and the TSA agents when you get to the checkpoint. - It was fun, buddy. - What am I supposed to do with the Bronco? - Keep it. Come here. And I don't need to tell you what to do with it. You're ten miles from Oregon. Come on, Wes. - That Maggie thing is real. She asked about you. Look... you're right. I had to lie to get a little freedom for myself and, I hurt some people. But... You don't have to lie. And... right now, you're only hurting yourself. - Get on the plane. Go on. - You know what to do with that Bronco. Luke, it's Phil again. Give me a call when you get a chance. Second voicemail. I don't know where you are, I don't know what's going on, and I don't know what you're doing, but you gotta get on that airplane, man. Remember, I put myself out there for this so don't screw me over. - Hey, buddy! Want to make a quick 20 bucks?
