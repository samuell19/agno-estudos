This place knows us. Our eternally young friend. He watches us age. A mirror of our age. He's pulling us back. Together. Gravity. MUSIC -"Please. "Thank you. We have three days to get to Milan. We're in no hurry. Or yes? Unfortunately yes. We have a meeting there. What meeting? What's our meeting? You will see. This is your wedding gift. MUSIC -Are you excited? -Yes. -Stamina. Lines and light are essential. Clean lines, horizontal and vertical. Thank you. Possibly concave. Aren't you afraid that your modern houses will spoil the landscape? Viktor, we know this. This is Von Abt's house in Stuttgart. -Can I ask you for an autograph? -Of course. Thanks, Herr Von Abt. We find your modern designs amazing. So, Frau Landauer, your husband told me you needed a house. What is your idea? Something like this? Not at all. Why not? -Such a beautiful hall. -Yes. But in his time. Two successful newlyweds. Why would I do that? Is there a line at your service for the poor and old, Herr von Abt? You will be able to build the best you can. No matter the money. That slope is a problem. It's sharp. Yes. But the slope gives the land height. It is oriented to the south. And that amazing view of the city! What do you want from that house? Simplicity, purity, light. A home that resonates with today. And you agree with today, Frau Landauer? It's not that easy. We are attracted to the future, but we long for the past. After the cave, the darkness. Are you ready to live in the light? I used to have a Landauer, Viktor. The best car you've ever made. I loved him. Forty-five. -Torpedo. -Yes. Unfortunately, I pointed him at the bus and we both went to the bottom. Didn't you want to show us something, Herr von Abt? Poor Liesel soon faints with anticipation. Sure. I'm a builder. I deal with matter. Not in style or form. Form is not the goal. It's just a way to solve a problem. So... View from the street. One-storey building. Low, inconspicuous. Behind the garage is an apartment for servants. Here. And here an open space with a view of the city. It is not entered from below, but from above. Bedrooms, bathrooms. Entrance hall lined with frosted glass. And the stairs down, to the heart of the house. Large open space with dining area. To talk, to meditate. Separate, yet interconnected. Parts of one unit. Steel and glass. Skeleton and skin. Instead of walls of air, trees, sky. When they hold their breath. And there is more. I'm talking to them about the weather. How they were on vacation. As little as possible about the work I get paid for. That's my rule. You, Liesel, are an exception. Because you know what you want. And now we race to be the first to give birth to our child. I think it's clear who wins. And that's the way it should be. You will be a family. -Hm. - "You breathe life into the house. -Family, that's an interesting problem. -And why? We strive for purity, for transparency, for freedom from compromise. But can we apply these ideals in the family? And yet have what we desire? Come up to me. Rainer! Forgive me. As I say, an interesting problem. One architect will not solve that. -Are you in love with him? -Do Rainer? -Hm. Oh my God! Hano, I barely got married! -So what? -And I look like a whale. No. You look divine. You've never been more beautiful. He kicks like a horse. -He? -Maybe, I don't know. Don't you want to find out? When he swings, he's a boy. When it's spinning, girl. My God, that's beautiful! May I reach out? If you want it. Your architect wrote to me. He invites me to dinner the next time he's here. Does not matter? Why should it? That glass is amazing, don't you think? Almost nothing. But that's all there is to it. -Liesel, that's beautiful. -"Thank you. We are happy about that. And what does my darling Ottilie say? What do you say to that? I don't like this. There is water on the terrace. I guarantee you that the terrace and roof are waterproof. But if you want, we can finish the roof. -Towers and a couple of spouts. -I persuaded him to take me with him. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin this moment for you. Ladies! It is said that ebony has already been transported to the workshop for the curved partition. As for the second place, I would have such a proposal. Splendor! What is it? Onyx. From the Atlas Mountains. -How much does it cost? -Look, Viktor, that veining, the color. Like something alive. And at sunset it glows red. Like a flame. The beating heart of your home. -So how much? -15 thousand dollars. You're crazy. The whole house can be bought for $ 15,000. Viktor, I know it's a lot. Liesel! We are already talking about our extravagance everywhere. What's up? Rainer built something extraordinary. Something that can survive us all. Please! Give him a chance to finish it. Die Bildung writes about you again. Experts admire clean lines and austere harmony, but it is possible in the modernist masterpiece of Mr. von Abt to really live? Such audacity! And how are you and your brother, Mrs. Laníková, lives in a work of art? -It's really beautiful here. But I'm glad I don't have to wash the windows. -Should I take her upstairs? -Yes thank you. Go, baby! - Are you still seeing him? -No. Have you forgiven me yet? By the way, he was just talking about you. When he didn't happen to talk about himself. He turned out to be a rather boring patron. -It's hard to be mad at you. -I know. But it was probably why. I guess I'm pregnant. God! Seriously? -Are you happy? -Of course. It's just a little early. Judging by you, there's nothing wrong with that. But not everyone is so easy. We tried and tried it and... But I don't seem to have children. Hano, I had no idea. Do you think it would be a disaster? No it does not. Why, you didn't tell me? You're my best friend. I know how lucky I am. And I'm really happy about it. Promise me you'll never doubt that I love you and your beautiful children. -No. -Martine, it's Marika's turn now. -No! Put it here! -Kato, look! -Yes. They left everything there. They just got on the first train. What she saw. Kosher cut the neck of a butcher from their street. They beat people. The old men were forced to scrub the sidewalks. But there are thousands of them, Liesel. Aren't you scared? I don't have to here. But what if yes? We are both married to Jews. It's only 50 kilometers away. Take the fish, please. -Sometimes I try it like this. -I also. That's the way I've always looked and I wondered how quiet it was out there. Can we Three duplicates. It's about transferring business ownership to your father-in-law. Just a formality, but a reasonable step. I also talked to Bohmer. He transfers money to Zurich. -Do you know when you're leaving? -I still hope it won't be necessary. Get to know the right moment. Vvyv- It will be even harder to convince my wife, Oscar. She doesn't even want to hear about it. She's pretty, isn't she? -I'm already terribly hungry. -So hurry! And it is done. -It looks great. - "Do you want this? Not now. Let's eat first. You can get out after lunch. -So good taste. -Will you give it to me, please? -It's good you stayed for lunch, Oscar. -Very pleased. Now eat, stop it. Victor! PRESSES THE CLICK BUT CANNOT BE OPENED. Knocking on the door - “Victor? -You can't come here now. Unfortunately. - "Yeah. I couldn't find you. -I won't be here long. Where are you going today? Recital in the Philharmonic. Then to Café Hilscher. Café Hilscher. Of course. Life goes on. So you take her away? Hano, I know how close you two are. When do you leave? We're still working on it, but soon. What about Kata and her little one? Suddenly with us. Liesel gives no choice. -Here you are! I'm sorry. Shall we go? -Yes. : I will be back soon. I told Kata I would pick up the kids. At least they won't have to wade through the snow. Damn. I forgot my tickets. I'm sorry, we have to go back. -Why? They'll let us in there anyway. -We have enough time. But, Frau Landauer, the snow. Doll, please! I'd like to come back. STRANGE SOUNDS WOMEN'S SENIAL IN SEX -Liesel... -Not now! Hi! It's very cold outside, Kato. Mom said we could have cocoa. Good. Are you back? I forgot something. Does he like you screaming? When did it start? Sometime in the summer. In August, I think. I'm sorry. I do not get it. -I was trying to be your girlfriend. -I know. We gave you a home. You were safe. -I know. I'm sorry. -Did you feel that you owed him? Not that. I wanted it myself. It wasn't right. I am very grateful to you. Very much. But gratitude is not enough. Be just a grateful refugee. I needed something more. Take Marika with you. Please. Take her with you. Did you hear what she said? To take Marika with us when we leave. -What are we going to do? -I do not know. Coward! Buy those tickets, Viktor. I don't want to be here anymore. He doesn't deserve you. I know. But children do. | you have to go. You have to convince Oscar. I'll convince him. We will come to you. I can not. The page is missing here. Strange that they decided like this at the last minute. Will they let them go? Yes, sure. That's what they're after. They need to get rid of them. He wanted me to cover it up. Supposedly that no one would turn it into ashtrays. This would be useful, too. And what if he comes back? They won't come back. I'm sorry, but that's not enough. She's fine. Issued by the League of Nations. -Continue, sir. -Let's go. -Wait a little longer! -God, we don't have time for this. -I'll catch up with you. It will be soon. -Hm. Don't worry, I'll be there in a minute. She is traveling with us. Come on, Viktor! I can't let her go. He doesn't have the right documents. I'm sorry. -Get on, sir, we have to go. -We're still waiting for someone. Viktor, for God's sake, get on a plane! Come on! Victor! Hold on! -Halt! -Let me go! Someone else is missing. Leave me alone! Do you want us all killed? You idiot! Get up! Get up! Victor! Come on! Mom, where's Marika? Get in there, Martin. Without! It is a terrible, old house, but it stands by the lake and has a garden. Kids like it here. There's a barge. And in winter you can ski here, if we are still here. Mom, look! Great, honey. You are handy. Like it was a vacation, right? But sometimes the vacation ends and one returns home. Viktor spends most of his time in Zurich. Apparently he goes to the German consulate. And he sends letters to all sorts of refugee organizations and refugee committees. He's trying to track her down. I feel like he's not thinking about anything else. Of course we are not talking about that. What on earth should I say? My God, I miss you so much. Can't you come? They blocked our bank accounts. The Oscars took the company and handed it over to a Schneider. To such a fool from the Sudetenland. They have a special date for that. They call it arization. I have to be careful what I write. Many things have changed in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, in that proud and grateful corner of the Great German Empire. -What does Hana write? -It's about Katy. She needed money. Just enough to get to Prague with Marika. They send trains with children to England. Parents just sit down their children on the train, waving at them and sending them away. -Can you imagine that? -And where is? -Where's Kata? -I do not know. He doesn't write that. I return there in dreams. I walk through the hall, everything is as before. I'm going down the stairs. 12 steps to bend. And the strangest thing is... That you are there. Always. Like I'm visiting you. Are you there. Are you waiting for me. You're waiting for me in the glass room. Do you even read what I write to you? I haven't had an answer from you in months. But I keep writing. Maybe unnecessarily. Villa Landauer? I know that well. I was there when they built it. Liesel was my friend. The house was empty. At least we found a use for it. I am an engineer. I have a team of designers, constructors. I must not reveal more. They took everything. Pictures. Kleea, Miróa. It was all very polite. One of those people once worked for Oscar in the office. Oskar asked him how his wife and children were doing. I'd rather scratch his eyes out. But a gift from you - remember? I hid it from them. She's safe. Oskar had not left the apartment for almost a year. Does not want. Not with that star on his jacket. He always took good care of me. All those years. I'll take care of him now. And now my news. Although who knows where and when to read it. I was in the villa. With her new tenant. "Will you have more? -No, thanks. -But it was good. -Yeah. This used to be a children's room. -Do you know their names? -No. Ottilie and Martin. Should I be remorseful that they're not here? You could at least look that way. I'm doing my job. Circumstances decide others. My husband is a Jew. I know. The local administrator felt obliged to inform me. What is it like to come back here? Terrible. You chose Liesla's room. Seriously? So this is your job? Aircraft? You can't come here. I already know what you mean. It's so nice. Unless he wants to believe what it's for. For bombing and killing. There are no load-bearing walls. Did you know that? Everything is hung on a steel skeleton. I knew an architect. We were lovers. -My colleagues will be here shortly. -Yeah. Tell me about your wife. I don't have a wife. I saw a picture of her. She is dead. I'm his fucking. That's how we live here now. The whole country is doing what it must. But you are here. Somewhere here. That's how I stay close to you. 3 years. Is it even possible? It was as if everything that had happened here happened to someone else. We are terribly estranged. Viktor and me. We both play our part of course. In front of children. One in front of the other. But I'm terribly lonely. And he too. Still, she asks me here and there to spend the night with him. Of course he thinks of her. And I? I am thinking about you. They all take them away! He can only wait for him to reach him. : -Please! - "I was waiting for you to come up with this. -Where are they taking them? -I don't know. Why should I know more than you? You can help us! You know a lot of people. Should I tell you about people I know? Those I know want to lock it up here and send us all home. What do you mean? What happened? We are fooled by idiots, fucking afraid. They are looking for who to blame. I'm sorry. So I'm not going to help your fucking husband. -You should have gone with friends. -I know. God, close it! -Get out of my house. -This is not your house. You should go now. Maybe this is the last time. He is watching... poor thing your dead wife? Never come back! It's a miracle, Liesel. Or a bad joke? -Excuse me, is Herr Stahl here? -I'm not white. They arrested me. Supposedly because of the scum. Or sabotage. They can't decide. Why did you come? It does not matter anymore. Please. You are pregnant? With me? My wife and I were expecting a baby. But she died in it. I thought we could handle it. But the day she came from the hospital, she filled the tub and cut her veins with my razor. I wish I could... Forgive me. But I'm actually happy. That is her? : The one who married a Jew? Oscar, if I'm not mistaken. Do not worry. We're here for Herr Stahl. You should run home. Behind the Oscars. -Were they here? Did they take him away? -Not open. So they slammed the door. Oscars! Oscars! Take it down! They say you have baby milk. Do you have money? It is from the sculptor Maillola. His mark is on the pedestal. It has a decent value. Liesel gave it to me when she got married. From what is it? Bronze? SIRENS HAVE, EXPLOSIONS ARE INVOLVED Shit! You better come with me. It's coming! March! My God, Martha! March! March! AIR RAIL, BOMB EXPLOSIONS March! SONG: We know the goal we're going for, I will not disappoint the comrades' confidence. And our work always changes the world, socialism is us. We build roads, we build roads, on the youth track, tunnel bridge. So I found you? So not Landauer, but Landor? Elisabeth Landor. Is that you? Maybe you finally decided to forget. Or do you still remember that house on the hill? For those wonderful, crazy times? To a girlfriend who loved you too much? Knocking on the door -Oskar! -I'm going. -It's for mom. -Thanks. Registered letter. From State Security. Good day. I got a summons. I sent that half a year ago. As you can see, your beautiful house is falling into disrepair without you. Whose house? Whose house? -Can't I write that to a friend? -Your friend is a cunt. Will you call me? The address is still the same, although the apartment is now a little smaller. In the middle is divided by a partition. Our neighbor is dying. I've heard him cough all night. He is a former professor of theology. But then he was sent to coal mines to complete his education. I like this part the most. I longed for you. She felt you. You're here, and yet you're not. Like a missing arm in which every nerve and muscle still hurts. At forty-six, they tried to get the house back. Did she tell you? No. She stopped writing to me. Aloud! Come on! I want to hear it. You don't want to read it? You are a teacher. You have a son. He says he is doing great at school. He definitely has a lot of plans. And a lot of hope. SONG Forward, comrades, behold the promised land, where there are no more lords or beggars. Forward, comrades, behold the promised land, which the poor man had sought in vain for ages. Forward, left, forward, left, step back. BEAT MUSIC PLAYS FROM THE GRAMOPHONE Maybe a few people will come today. Nevermind? No, no problem. I won't be home. Damn. Oh yeah. Hold on. It suits you. There's a woman here. She said something about the urban planning department. He claims to know Grusha. -There's a problem here. -Only when it rains. Maybe Viktor was right. The flat roof never seemed to him. R v Reception does not begin until 6 p.m. I'd like to take a look around before that. Didn't Grusha warn you? I am now writing an article for Literární listy. On what topic? House architecture. His story. I never understood what everyone saw on him. Supposedly half of the people at these events are informers? Half? Definitely not. - "You're late! -We're here, boss. -Go there! Move! And here's another one! -Even more wine? -Thanks. "Honor! -Hello, comrade! Hi, Laník! Literary papers. Yeah, I know you. Very interesting. | such views should, of course, be heard, however, we must not allow confusion. We must not allow morale among people to fall. We must proudly declare our success. Cheers. I don't want those cucumbers! -I can get a wagon of vodka. -That's exactly what we need. -So you want to? -Yeah. People like you and you slandering crap! You are trying to destroy us. You are trying to destroy everything the party has done! Are you leaving already? I think I've seen enough. That article of yours. What will you write in it? That the house is slowly falling apart. Above all, it. Above all, be careful not to slander the party. But, Laník. Are you blind It's end. Who knows what will happen, comrade? Neither me nor you. You know the course of the whole construction and all the plans of the architect better than anyone else. I can't imagine going back there. At the event that we hope you will attend, we want to declare a charity fundraiser and raise funds around the world. The house has a number of admirers. It will function as part of the city museum. I'm grateful you appreciated the trip here, Mr. Merry, but I don't know how I can help you. I have something else. An article written by one of your acquaintances. Another person who remembers the house as it used to be. Hana! She gave me a letter for you. She insisted that I pass it on to you in person. Would you leave me alone? Mom? Mr. Merry? Martin. Sorry I'm late. Your mother wanted to be alone for a while. And you are here. Somewhere here. That's how I stay close to you. MUSIC This is Oscar. My son. Oscar, I'm so happy to meet you. Welcome back to Czechoslovakia. It's bigger than I remember. Maybe too big. They're probably right when they want to make it a museum. I realized a terrible thing. I didn't know Lanik's first name at all. What do you think? What will happen to him? I do not know. He can handle it. You can be sure of that. Would he let me sleep here? Just one night. I don't want to sleep in a hotel. I'll take care of it. Shall we have some more awful wine? He built a yacht and sailed out to sea with it. Alone. The storm came. It was as if the end of the world had come. Come on! Guys, this is Martin. A friend from America. Hello. Lenka. I am pleased. We sat here. Do you remember? Of course I remember. I never stopped thinking about it. As you wanted me, and I turned you down. I had to leave. I was afraid it would destroy me. And now I'm afraid it's too late. It can never be too late for us. THE SOUND OF A FLYING HELICOPTER THE SIRENS are honking These are Russians. Mom, we have to leave. Oskar has a man who will take us to the border. But we have to go now. I know. Mom, we have to go! Wait please. I can't leave. If i stay will you stay with me Of course. House, all those plans, none of this will happen now. I know. It does not matter. It was such a beauty. Yes. That was it. -Of course yes. -I am not hungry. -I do not either. Come on, honey. And she says: Rainer, clothes? Where will I put all my clothes? Me: This is a cottage. One dress is all you need here. Hang them on the bedroom door. Wait. Sun. Come on! It will be in a moment. So let's look at it. Now! It'll be done soon. This is it. That's beautiful, isn't it?
