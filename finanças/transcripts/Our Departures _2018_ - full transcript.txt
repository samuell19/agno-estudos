Come on... hurry! Wait up, Shunya! Watch your step! Is it here? It's the EH500! - I saw Kintaro. - You did? - Yeah. - You did? - My view was blocked. - I missed it. Shunya. - Where is it bound? - Nagoya, right? Correct. How far do these tracks go from Sapporo? Tell her. Makurazaki on the Ibusuki Line. Where's that? Kagoshima's southern tip. That's the other end of Japan! Yeah. From Wakkanai in Hokkaido all the way down. That's incredible. Dad? How long would it take to get to Kagoshima on a local? Stopping at every station? I want to give it a go. - Me, too! With all the transfers? Sounds fun. Yeah, we'll bring boxed lunches. I prefer the bullet train. That's cheating! Akira, wake up. Wake up. Look, the ocean. Hey, yeah. Our Departures Train approaching. Please wait behind the yellow line. Stand clear of the doors on the left side. Thank you. Thank you. Want the ticket? Yeah. Can we keep the ticket stub? Sure. Let's go. I've been working on the railroad All the live long day I've been working on the railroad Just to pass the time of day Are you sure this is the right way? I think so. My turn. Your train operator: Okuzono Setsuo All systems go. Good night. She's all yours. My log sheet. Thank you. - Good evening. - Have a nice evening. Good night. Good night. Who are you? How do you do? I'm Akira, Shuhei's wife. This is Shunya. Your grandson. I knew it. What? The train driver? Come in. Please. Come in. Take a seat. I'll put on some tea. That's OK. Akira. Right. Here. Pardon me. What is this? It's Shuhei. He's dead? I knew it. You didn't get my messages. You have 10 messages. Hello. This is Akira, Shuhei's wife. There's something I must tell you, Could you call me? This is Irodori Health Foods... Hello? It's Akira again. Shuhei has... passed away. The wake is tomorrow. The funeral is the day after tomorrow. The wake... has just finished. Are you hearing this? What is your problem? Why won't you answer the phone? You call yourself a parent? Say something! When? Two weeks ago today. Cerebral haemorrhage. Shunya, have this too. Hello? Why are you calling me so late? Can you come over, Sister? What's wrong? Shuhei's dead. That's not funny. Would I call you just to joke with you? Are you serious? His wife is here with their child. You mean the young woman he remarried a year ago? That's the one. OK, I'll be right over. - Thanks. - No worries. No, wait. Make it tomorrow. Tomorrow's better? Yeah. OK. See you then. Hey... Hey! My sister will drop by later. Shunya? Shunya? Where are you? You found me. Dad must've drawn it. I'm home. Welcome back. Where are they? Upstairs. Good night. Leave the lights on. I know. So... tell me what happened to Shuhei. He was working at home. He suddenly... felt a tightness in his chest. He called for an ambulance himself. And then? I was at my part-time job. I rushed to the hospital. Shuhei was in great spirits. He was laughing. "Sorry about this..." "but I'm fine now", he said. I was so relieved to see him. I said, "Don't scare me like that!" So I went home. I promised... I'd visit again the next day. I got a call early the next morning. He had a cerebral haemorrhage. And passed away. Blow your nose. Thank you for coming all this way. So... what are your plans now? We'd appreciate it... if we could stay here a while. What? We were kicked out of our apartment in Tokyo. But why? We couldn't afford the rent. We're in heavy debt. Debt? Shuhei was deceived by his work mates. What do you mean? He was an illustrator, wasn't he? Six months ago he was asked to start a new company with some colleagues. But they ran off with the money he'd invested. Oh my. That's awful. What will you do with Shunya? What do you mean? I mean, he's not your child by blood. He's my son! When I married Shuhei I vowed to be Shunya's mother. I understand your feelings but how do you plan to raise him? I'll find work. You'll find work, huh? You won't earn enough working part-time. Mr Okuzono, do you have a moment? Sure. About our talk the other day... I was hoping you'd reconsider. Not that again. People just don't retire at 60 anymore. Can't you train new operators? We've been recruiting, but... Anyway... I'm just curious what you plan to do if you retire now. You don't have any hobbies. I'll think of something. Good afternoon. -Go get them. -I will. Thanks. I'll take that. Great. Thank you. Grab that, Shunya. Well? Shunya. This was Shuhei's phone. I want you to have it. Really? Cool. OK. Let's get to it. Flatten those? OK. Why a transfer student now? It must be tough for you. Ms Yuri. May I guess your age? 25. Yes. Bingo? How did you know? Yes! This is something I used to do at work. I was pretty good. I guess that makes us the same age. Is that so? Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you very much. Who is he? I don't know. How's school? It's OK. You prefer Tokyo? How about you, Akira? Anywhere's fine as long as we're together. What a view. Yeah. I can see the ocean. Hey! Hey! Think Grandpa's driving? Can you see? Not really. Single-car trains are pretty cute. Orange Railway cars have engines. They run on diesel. No kidding. So, it's just like a car. You could drive one, I bet. Who, me? I doubt that very much. There's no way. Oh. I just kind of thought you could. Orange Railway Job Interview Next applicant, please. This application came in at the very last minute. - I see. - Come in. Pardon me. Are you all right? Go ahead. I'm Okuzono Akira. Thank you for seeing me. Yes. Please have a seat. Ms Okuzono. He's also Okuzono. You live in Tokyo but you have relatives in this area? Do you know her? No. Why do you want to be a train operator? It'll please my son. What? That's your reason? My son adores trains. I'd like to become an operator so I can give him a ride on my train. Don't you find that reasoning a bit personal? That's OK. It's as good a reason as any. It certainly is. Ms Okuzono. Driving a train is very different from part-time work. You'll be responsible for people's lives. It's a heavy responsibility. Getting a national qualification isn't easy. I know I'm not ready yet. But I hope to change. I believe driving a train will change me. Allow me to clarify. This isn't an electric train we're talking about here. No, it's a rail-car, to be precise. It runs on diesel. That's right. She knows her stuff. Very good. Pretty impressive. I agree. That's it, then. Shunya! Welcome home. I, Okuzono Akira am an operator-in-training for the Orange Railway. Seriously? Seriously. Seriously serious? Shunya. When I become an operator will you ride my train? You bet I will! It's a deal, Shunya! - Yes! - Surprised? Totally! Train driver... Keep pushing, Shunya! Good morning! Bye, Akira. See you later. Shunya. Good luck. This is Okuzono Shunya from Tokyo. Tokyo is famous for Tokyo Tower! Quiet! The Hisatsu Orange Railway runs from Yatsushiro in Kumamoto to Sendai in Kagoshima. It was the former JR Kagoshima Line. Look, the bullet train! Confirm a clear track. Right, left. We expected the bullet train to close down our line. But the local citizenry protested. And so we were kept alive as a third-sector operation. Right, left. Third sector? We're now jointly run as a public and private venture. Come quickly. Stand clear of the closing doors. The Orange Diner Smile when you wave. The Orange Diner is our main draw. A diner? Operating a dining car must be hard. Why so? Think about it. Customers are dining on the train. Yeah. So you have to drive smoothly. Ouch, it's hot! Tissue! Here. Our trains have only one or two cars. But the platform is long. Yeah, you're right. Ten-car sleeper trains used to stop here back in the day. The famed Blue Train too. Blue Train? You've never heard of it? Akatsuki, Myojo, Naha, Hayabusa. Sounds like a magic spell. So, this is the Blue Train? The Hayabusa Express from Tokyo to Kagoshima was super popular. It's gone? Discontinued a long time ago. How sad. Operators also do the refuelling. Got it. You good? Open it up! OK. Are you ready? Yeah! It looks so big up close. Compared to a car, yeah. Can I operate such a giant? I can't even drive a car. What? No driver's licence? No. And you want to operate a train? Yes. Look at this. I've never had to study this much. Hey, Shunya. Next month. I've got to go to the JR Training Centre in Fukuoka. In Moji, right? Grandpa told me. I'm sorry. About what? Aren't you going to miss me? I'll be fine. I see. Better study hard, Akira. Not everybody passes the test. Don't worry, I'm really good at guessing. Well, then. I'd better study. OK then, bye. Bye, Ms Yuri! Don't. Why? Don't come to my school. Well, you never answer your phone. Or my text messages. I can't see you anymore. Why not? I'm pregnant. Are you serious? No way... Ms Yuri. Ms Yuri! Ms Yuri, what's the matter? Ambulance... Ms Okuzono? - I'm fine. - No, you're not! It'll pass. I'm OK. You don't look it. No, I'm fine, really. Listen to me. It's morning sickness. Congratulations. You're the first to say that. Why? He's married. Oh, I see. Sorry. Forget I said that. What will you do? About the baby. What will you do? I can't have this baby. Why? Why? Nobody wants it, that's why. It will only be born into a life of misery. Abortion is the only option. Ms Okuzono? Are you all right? I'm fine. What's the matter? They say the baby's gone. I see. I'm sorry, Shuhei. Okuzono Family Grave Thank you. Here. Okuzono Shuhei Shunya. Your turn. How's school? It's all right. It's all right? Is your teacher nice? Hey, Akira. Should I have offered black coffee instead? Shuhei wouldn't drink coffee without sugar. You got him the right drink He really is gone, isn't he? Time to go? Yeah, time to go. Hello. Hello. You're in charge of dishes, trash bathroom cleaning and breakfast. I know. And you'd better study hard, Akira. I know. - The train is arriving. - Dad. Call me right away if anything happens. -Stand behind the yellow line. -Understood. Take care of yourselves. I'll be off then. What is it? You'll be back, right? Why wouldn't I? You're here, aren't you? Be good. Stand clear of the doors. I can do it. - Good morning. - Good morning. Get me a plate. It's burnt. Sorry. Wish me luck. A slow one. A slow one? Come on, challenge yourself. Try 80. Feet at shoulder width. Good. Tuck in your chin. Now. Glare at the pitcher. No, you're holding it the other way round. And closer together. - Ready? - Is it coming? OK. - It's coming? - Here we go. Almost. Eyes on the ball. It's coming. That's OK... You'll hit it eventually. Who's the next batter? Okuzono. - Oh, Okuzono. - He'll strike out for sure. Let's bet on a miracle. Come on, Tokyo! Go, Tokyo! Let's go, Okuzono. What the heck was that? Last home visit today? Three more to go. That's hard work. Not at all. Well, thank you. Shunya must miss Akira terribly. He's pretty used to it. Pardon me for asking but where's his birth mother? She died after giving birth. I'm so sorry. Poor Shunya has lost both parents so young. Thank you for everything. My pleasure. Shizuka... Let me hold him. No! Shizuka... The taxi's here. You got him? Mother? Mother! - Excuse me... - Mother! What's this? Where are you going? We're taking him. - What? - You can't possibly raise him! Shuhei, you don't earn enough money. I'll manage. -Careful! -Stop that. Let me go. Careful! - Stop! - Shuhei! - Tamiko! - Careful! That's my son! - Stop it! - Give him back! Shuhei, calm down! Mother. We talked this over with your father. It's better this way. Like hell it is! Shunya is my child! Go home! Leave! Go home! Go... I'm sorry, Shunya. It's sweet. Want to go somewhere fun? Like where? Like the zoo. Or the aquarium. We could see a locomotive. Anywhere I'd like? Of course. I used to come here all the time. With Dad? That's right. Ready? Stand with your feet at shoulder width. Tuck in your chin. Now glare at the pitcher. What's wrong? Did Dad get a hit? Yeah, a double. OK, then. Ready? I'll drop in the coin. What was that? - That was close. - I grazed it. Keep your chin in. Watch the ball. Yes! I hit it, Grandpa! Cool. Next pitch is coming. Yes, I hit it again! JR Kyushu Training Centre The electric circuitry works like this. Once in the starting position circuits 11 and 12 are activated which show up as AR11 and AR12. The service brake position is here. Beyond this is emergency braking. Okuzono, why don't you give it a try? Yes, sir. Turning past this point triggers the emergency braking. So, be careful. Next, Hanada, you try. That's how the braking system works on the wheels. Let's see exactly how it works. Hit the brake. This is what we call dynamic braking... I'm tucking in. Take it. - No, you take it. - Please. I insist. How about sharing these? I mean... curry without carrots is sad. Here you go. Thank you. It's my pleasure. We're having curry too. Sweet potatoes taste great in curry. Here, have some. You think I'm yanking your chain, don't you? You'll love it. Trust me. It brings out the sweetness. But it tends to melt away into the curry so don't cut it too small. - I'll give it a try. - Please. Ready? Fight! Let's go! Push... push! You've got this, Shunya! Shunya's the winner! Yeah! I did it! Way to go, Shunya. Victory dinner? Yeah! I won fair and square! No Chinese? OK, we'll do hamburgers. Yes! Dad as a kid with Grandpa! Akira: He was a cutie! Akira: You look like him! The Hayabusa. What a sour face you have. Well, it was while I was working. I never imagined you'd be left all alone, Brother. Shunya. Take a bath and go to bed. OK. A bath will feel great. OK. Train approaching. For your safety please wait behind the yellow line. Shunya! Akira! - Welcome back! - It's great to see you. -Did you do OK? -Yeah, I worked hard! Me too. Train Operator Licence Hey, Akira. What was your first drive like? I was like, "Oh my god. It's really moving!" - How about you, Grandpa? - What? Do you remember your first drive? I sure do. How long ago was it? Let's see... 37 years. But I was more nervous when I first drove the Hayabusa. Dad was on that train with you, right? Yeah. That's amazing. Shuhei rode on the train you drove. Akira? Want a drink? Sounds good. Let's drink. Good evening! Good evening! How did you do? I did it somehow. Matsutake mushrooms! Thank you so much. Looks delicious. Thanks. I didn't know you drank, Akira! I love shochu. Glad to hear it. Let's make a toast. Congratulations on getting your licence. - Congratulations! - Thank you! Wow, that's good. I'm ready for your instructions. Good. I shall now begin inspections. Work safely. Right, left, ground, check. Now boarding. Ignition switch A, OK. ATS, OK. Engine on! Extinguisher, check. Rotation, check. Reserve tank sufficient. Lock standby, lock on, lock off. Lock secure. Your train operator: Okuzono Akira Confirming current Line Two. One, two, three. Signal A, OK. Switching to Line One. Embarking. Shifting to first gear. How many minutes to the next stop? Three minutes until arrival. Open the doors, quickly. Doors on the left will open. Thank you. How about that? A woman driver. New driver? Do your best. Thank you. Your braking was late. You score a 30. All right... one more metre! Stop! Engaged! Follow the guide marks. I am. Give it here. No. I can do it myself. Check your speed or you'll overshoot. Got it. Doors on the left will open. Thank you. Much better today. New driver, you're doing great. Here's a snack for you. Thank you very much! My first compliment. Still a long way to go. So, what's my score? Hard to say. Look! He's really good! You like trains, Shunya? Is it the Orange Railway? Hey, give that back! Give it back! Okuzono's a train geek. Give it here! Hey, the driver is a woman! Yeah! Why? Is it because you like women? Give it back to him. Why? Do you like him? I didn't say that. Just give it back. - Here. - I knew it. Girls like Tokyo boys. What's this piece of junk? Give that back! Give it back! Fight! - Give it back! - Let go! Fight! Ouch! Get the teacher. Are you OK? Are you OK? He's bleeding! Hurry, get the teacher! It hurts. - Ms Yuri! - Are you OK? I am so sorry about this. Do you know how close he came to losing an eye? I'm terribly sorry. You call that an apology? I want you to kneel and apologise. Don't do that. Why not? It was just a fight between children. Both are equally to blame. Don't you think? Tell me, Ms Yuri. If my child ends up losing an eye will you still call it a fight among children? I didn't mean that. Speaking of attitudes... I've been meaning to ask you. You're pregnant, aren't you? I think it sets a bad example. A grade school teacher being an unmarried mother. The same goes for you. How old were you when you had him? Where's his father? Where is he and what is he doing? I am Shunya's parent. No father, huh? I'm his parent. I'm not asking that... Shut up! Well, I never... Shunya. Shunya. Apologise. Shunya. Come on. Apologise. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Bad parents, bad kids. A fight, huh? They were pulling on his pencil case and the keychain hit a boy in the eye. The reason? What were they fighting about? I didn't ask. I'm such a failure. It's just children fighting. No big deal. Parents don't need to interfere. I can be his parent, right? I have no idea... how to be a good parent. My folks were a bad example. How so? Never mind. It's not my place to know. But I've seen good people, born from bad parents. Here is your Berkshire pork roast. They're ready to go. I hope we can see it. I'm so excited. You're running late. Raise the speed. Yes, sir. Don't speed up at once! I'm sorry. You need to brake more gently. Remember the passengers are dining. Yes, sir. Akira? Ms Yuri! Look how big you've gotten! You look great in uniform. You're on maternity leave? Starting today. I'm glad you weren't fired. Yeah, just barely. May I touch it? I can't wait to meet you. It's all thanks to you. that we can meet this baby. Thank you. The Semi-Coming-Of-Age Ceremony... commemorates your tenth year since birth. It's an opportunity to give thanks to your parents. Listen up. Your first task is to interview your parents. How did they feel at your birth? Were they happy? Moved? Ask them how they felt. Then you are to write an essay. At the ceremony you'll read your essay to them aloud. Be sure to give them the handouts. To Shuhei Shunya. What? I'm working tonight. Your dinner's in the microwave. I'm going now. See you later. Emergency! What happened? Okuzono, make the announcement. Yes, sir. What are you doing? We had to make a sudden stop for a deer obstructing the tracks. We ask for your patience as we assess the situation Ms Okuzono! Grab the other side. Here we go. Hold it! Ready, set... What are you doing? Grab on firmly! Ms Okuzono! - Hey! - No! Get a hold of yourself! Hey! No... Shuhei? That's not funny! I scared you? Sorry... You're OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... had this sudden pain in my chest and panicked. I've been working too hard lately. But don't worry. My debts are almost paid off. When things settle down the three of us will go to a hot spring. What's wrong? Wait, are you crying? Hey, don't cry! I'm sorry. That was a bad joke. You scared me. Sorry... Come on. It's OK. Climb in. - It's warm. - Is it? Want to stay over? Mr Okuzono? Wait. Yes? - Mr Okuzono? - Yes? You're awake. I'll get the doctor. - Sure. - Let's get some fresh air. It's a beautiful day. Let's open this too. Yeah, it's a great day. It really is. Great day for a walk. Akira. What? She became hysterical? It wasn't normal at all. Hitting a deer for the first time is traumatic for everyone. I hope that's all it is. Sir, I'm done. It looks good. Thank you. My Mother How was the test? It was fine. Knock it off... Knock it off... Give it back... We apologise for the sudden stop. There was an obstruction on the tracks. We appreciate your patience. Listen. Pull up to the stop point. Hey! OK. Left, right, ground, check. You're carrying passengers. I'm very sorry. Is everything OK? Will I be disqualified? What do you think? Hello. I'm Suzuki Moeka's mum. You're Shunya's mother, right? Yes. Looking forward to Sunday? It'll be hard not to cry. Sunday? You'll be there, won't you? The Semi-Coming-Of-Age Ceremony. My husband got so excited he even invited the in-laws. Why didn't you tell me? You're busy with work, aren't you? I'll take a day off. You don't have to. Anyway, I'm going. No, you can't come! Please... don't come. Why not? Please. Good morning. Ms Okuzono, may I have a word? May I change first? It'll just be a minute. A leave of absence? Yes. Why not just take some time to think things over? Whether driving a train is really what you want to do. Not everyone is suited for this work. Why? Why do you think I'm not suited for it? I didn't say that... Isn't that what you thought of me all along? Do you think I'm not suited for it too? Suited for what? Do you think this job is impossible for me? Only if you think it's impossible. With parents like mine I am the happiest kid in the world. Thank you. I hope to make you proud. I'm ten this year. Soon I'll be twenty, an adult. That's what I believe. Dad, thank you for all the things you bought me with your hard-earned money, I love you, Mum and Dad. And I always will. Thank you, Sugiyama Fumina. Next, we'll hear from Okuzono Shunya. Yes. Are Shunya's parents here? They couldn't make it? I see. Well, give it your best. Semi-Coming-Of-Age Ceremony My Father. By Okuzono Shunya. Shortly after I was born my mother died due to an illness. That is why I have no memory of her. I can't remember her face. My father raised me all by himself. My father... is an illustrator who loves trains. He's very kind and funny too. Excuse me. He teaches me baseball, And he's good at making curry. When we take a bath together he likes to fart a lot. Whenever he drinks milk he always burps. Last summer he took me on a railway trip. Me and my dad rode trains all over Kyushu. Every train we rode we would sit right at the front. Those were me and my dad's specially reserved seats. I love you very much, Dad. And I miss you. I miss playing with you. I miss eating with you. I miss talking to you. Please, Dad. Stay with me. Be my Dad... forever. Let's go home. OK, Shunya? No. May I ask who you are? - We're going. - Wait a second. - Let's go home. - Let me go! -Shunya! -Ma'am, please! Stop! - Shunya! - Please stop! Get away! Shunya! Everyone, please stay calm. Shunya! Shunya! Your dad is dead. Liar! It's not a lie! He died! He's gone! No! You're a liar! Your dad has passed away. You can't see him anymore. I wish it were you. I wish you had died instead of him! I'm so sorry. It was poor communication on the school's part. We're very sorry. It's fine. Where's Shunya? He's holed up in his room. I see. And Akira? She isn't back yet. I'm sorry she's not here to greet you. Not at all. We came to apologise. It's quite all right. You should get out of the cold. Please. Here. It's the essay Shunya wrote. Good night. Good night. Semi-Coming-of-Age Ceremony This is what happens when you selfishly leave us and die. I suddenly felt like eating curry. Want some? Yeah. Need help? Sure. Wash the sweet potatoes. OK. Let's eat. How is it? It's good. Your dad liked it too. Grandpa? What? I said some horrible things to Akira. Tokyo's got a lot of train tracks. Father? How did you find me? Shunya said you'd come here. We used to come here after shopping. The three of us. I often... took Shuhei to the rail yard in Kagoshima. He'd stand there for hours. He just kept watching the trains. I thought he'd follow in my footsteps. Then suddenly he said he wanted to be an artist. Tokyo seemed so far away but now that I'm here, it's no big deal. With an early train you can get here by noon. Actually... I need to apologise to you. About what? Shuhei once asked me if we could move to Kagoshima. He asked me when he got into debt. But... I said I didn't want to. I wanted him... to continue working as an illustrator. And... going to Kagoshima would feel like running away. I see. But thinking back on it now... I think... he was looking for an excuse. I think he wanted an excuse... to return home and reunite with you. You said you wanted to drive a train for Shunya. Yes. Trains are vehicles that move people from place to place. Having someone you want to give a ride to is a special thing. I never thought of it that way before. But I'm glad I do now. You taught me that. I should go soon. Early start tomorrow. Father? You're free to decide what you want to do. You're still young. The choice is all yours. If you decide not to return I'll raise Shunya. You needn't worry. Hello? Did you eat? Finish your homework? What about a bath? Did you take one? It's supposed... to rain tomorrow... so don't forget an umbrella. I'm sorry. Shuhei Shunya Please! I want to drive a train. Welcome home. Welcome home to you too. Thanks. Guess what? It didn't rain. You are you. So, stay with me as you are. That's Grandpa. Driving that train. Definitely. Let's go. Grandpa! I'm not giving up, you know. On driving a train... or being part of this family. My Family. My Family by Okuzono Shunya I'm lucky to be part of a big family, There's my mum who gave birth to me. My dad who raised me. And now... I'm living with my grandpa and Akira. - Hello. Let me. - Hello. Thank you. Akira is a driver for the Hisatsu Orange Railway. She has finally completed her training and is now a full-fledged operator. She's going to be a great driver. Thanks to you we have a promising new operator. With this momentum can we find one more? Don't get ahead of yourself. But it's not a bad line of work. Wait... Does this mean you won't retire? Yes! Grandpa sometimes accidentally calls me by my dad's name. But I pretend not to notice. I consider it my duty as a loving grandchild. To be honest I still think about my dad a lot and it makes me sad. - Shunya! - Bye! - Bye! - See you! Shunya! But it never lasts very long. That's because my great family... is just starting to move forward. Thank you. This is so exciting. Yeah. Drive safely. Roger that. Good luck, Akira. Thanks. What's his name? - This is Souki. - Souki? Souki, what a cutie you are! Good luck. Thanks. Come aboard. Please. Thank you for riding with us today. Your operator is Okuzono. Please enjoy the ride. This is a local train... now departing for Sendai Station. Please stand clear of the doors. Platform clear, door closing. All systems go. Line One. Now departing.
