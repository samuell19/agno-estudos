Fill 'er up, hurry up! The jerk is completely deaf. He is completely deaf, he is completely deaf. Are they taking you to the country, buddy? We're leaving. Why isn't the toilet working? Hey... (...) Fill 'er up, quick! Am I supposed to wait here forever? Could you check the oil for me? - Sure. The holy trinity. The Crimson Sunset You're driving like a lunatic. I thought we were going to use this summer vacation to relax. Just look at them. Starring No one should live around here... ...except maybe during the summer, if any summer comes at all. Which is why most of these secluded places are all deserted... ...the minute the road reaches them. Then the men realize there is actually a way to escape this place. Summer vacation. I've always said that the situation...(...) Well, that's how she's been these...(...) Maybe we should just cancel the whole thing. Go to a real hotel, like those boys driving the jeep. We're twenty years too late for that, pal. Just think how peaceful it will be and those old houses. This is just what we need, a few days of peace and quiet. You know what, I may be staying for a month or even longer. These photos in the book, do you think the place looks like that? I promise you. Is this the place? - I think so. It looks like everybody's dead. Are you crazy? The dead need some help waking up. You never know, accidents do happen. Put the gun down for christ's sake! This is a bird of prey, destroying nature. Protect nature...(...) - You think so, eh? Oh, my fishing rod. Good day. Or rather, good evening. Are you waiting for someone? You nailed it. So, is there another way to get there besides the boat? Not likely. Unless you're able to fly like the fulmar. I see. Perhaps that is the reason why the village was deserted? I guess so. The population was at least 200. But everyone left once the herring had vanished. Do you know who the man is? - No. Why do you ask? I was just curious. Never seen him before. A radio? I wouldn't call it that. - And this? This is just some useless junk. Can we borrow it? I will pay. You won't receive any transmissions between these mountains. This mainly comes in handy to signal other ships on the high seas. It has been malfunctioning lately, but you are welcome to take it if you want. No thank you. The main thing is to get away, escape the stress of the city and the phone. And what have the gentlemen got planned once they get there? Fix the old houses, build factories and make lots of money... ...then we build casinos and whorehouses. By the way, I've been wondering. Wasn't there some woman who lived there... ...long after everyone else had left the place? She died three years ago. The body had begun to decompose once they found her. The poor fool never surfaced. The poor fool? Her son. A real simpleton whose boat crashed. Did he drown? I guess the sea greeted him, since the poor boy wasn't welcome anywhere else. They found the debris from his boat later that autumn. This was seen as a murder investigation. How was she able to live at that place? That is the mysterious part, how could she live there? Maybe elves and spindles kept her company? Perhaps she just died once the poor fool had perished. Do you go there often? Nowadays, no one visits the place, not a soul. A wasteland as far as the eye can see. If we would crash around here, no one would know about it... ...except the one who knows everything. And we would probably be dead by then. Whenever I hear someone mention a fool... ...I think of the fool from The Saga of G?sli S?rsson... ...the one who was kept tethered to a pole and would eat grass. Tied to a stall, like an animal. Daddy's coming tomorrow. The fucking radio doesn't seem to be working... ...unless this is some kind of modern music. We should have brought along a walkie-talkie. We'll only be there for four or five days. Four? I'll need to make a phone call on Monday. We will tell him to pick us up on Sunday. - He better, otherwise I'll kill him. So, it looks like the dream is finally coming true. Yeah, just think how many times we've made this trip in our minds. Is that ship supposed to be there? This is a relic from the southern part. Now the plan is to unwind. Relax and rest. Yeah well, it can be quite tricky to relax. Give my regards to the fulmar. Oh, and be sure to bring some employees on Sunday to work in the whorehouse. You could almost think that the people just left this place. We should have brought some ladies along to squeeze. This is it. - Are you sure? It's the one from the photo. Just... just imagine if there were two broads still hanging around here. Don't you think they'd look pretty raddled by now? Resident of ravines, ancient waterfall. The gorge between women's problems. What's going on? Have you become obsessed with the ladies? Yeah, this one is nice. - Don't you think so? She'll bring us luck. Listen, did you know that there were two cars here once? Cars? Here? What were they doing with cars in a place like this? One was a truck that was used to get sand from up there. And the CEO owned a luxury car. The cars had only been here for a few months when they got in a collision. No. I don't believe it. - I swear. Just imagine, two cars in the entire village... ...and somehow they manage to crash into each other. How is that even possible? Can't you picture it? This is too much. Listen, you know what? I read this somewhere. I read somewhere that Selma J?nsd?ttir, Miss Iceland... ...around 1957-1960, she is from this place. It's true. The prettiest girls usually come from the ugliest places. Are you finished? - Yes, throw away the rest. Just think about it. All these people just leave their houses... ...and abandon the village. All these houses! There's gotta be something they can be used for. The last ones to leave this place, were some halfwit and his mother. The devil and his grandma? What were they doing here? I said a halfwit and his mother, they were the last to leave. Yeah well I would have pinched her. When I was sent to a farm as a kid, there was a halfwit who lived there. No wonder, with you there. And I'm telling you, he got seriously mistreated. No kidding, so everyone was bad to you on that ranch? Stop acting like a kid. Is it my fault that you were known as a halfwit on that ranch? The profit from the herring harvesting, it must be hidden somewhere around here. Where are you going? - Something I forgot. D?ri? D?ri? Arn?r? Arn?r? Get over here and check this out. Is something missing? No, I just thought I'd left my sweater there. You had it on the boat. Are you sure? - Yeah. No, I have probably forgotten to take it along. You saw it yourself, it was lying on top of the heap. Well, in that case it must be in the house. Unless that man stole it. And this is where people would gather, without any schnapps. Perfectly isolated. Stairway to heaven? Straight up to heaven. - The follies of men have no limits. Building all these structures. - Perhaps this was the CEO's office? It must have been at least this big. Shall we explore the heavens? I'm not planning on joining God, not just yet. Downward instead? Isn't that the direction we're constantly heading towards? Next please! What can I do for you, my good lady? Well, it happened like this: Gunni the doorman told me that I could come... ...inside the party as long as I would let him come inside me later. Gunnar is a fertile lad, isn't he? Please lie down on that couch over there my good lady. First the shoes, then the panties. - There is nothing wrong with my panties. Well, you never know, you might be a nymphomaniac. On the couch. Enough, let's go. - Don't be scared, I won't bite. Fucking stop already! - Get on the couch. Quit acting like a goddamn moron. Take it easy. You could have a miscarriage. Hey, what are you doing! Are you nuts? Come on, get over here. Fine, go kill yourself then. - What's wrong? Acting like a woman. Get over here. Come on, come on. This must have been the room where the CEO lived. And at least two or three girls in every single room to choose from. A paradise, harem. While we are stuck with the same old broads. We have to make do with what we got. It's just as well they don't know where we are now. I told her I was going fishing, that we were going fishing. Listen. You want to know something? Something special concerning the CEO. Not only did he sleep with the herring ladies... ...but also with his money, like a dragon protecting his gold. He stuffed it in the mattress. I'm telling you, it is full of money. Fucking scumbag. Stealing your sweater. - What have you got against him? That expression on his face. Guys like him have a certain smell around them. That is all in your head. Aren't you worried... ...there is a Russian spy following us too? I'm sure of it. I remember there was a guy like him back on the farm. Oh right, when you were considered a halfwit? Guys like him always hide a dagger up their sleeve. Listen, I'll tell you what we'll do. When he comes back to pick us up, we will seize his boat... ...and leave that old fuck right here. You could just shoot him in the face with the shotgun. Oh, that would be too good for him, way too good. Or even better, we could transform him into guano, right? We'll start the factories and make tons of money. I have a feeling he wouldn't pick us up if he knew what we were planning. He wouldn't pick us up? No, he will pick us up alright, you can be sure of that. We could also crucify him and turn him into a saint. Hey, where are you? Here, catch. - And one to the sky. Last one. Enough, let's go. - Just leave me here. Come on, I'll help you up. Yeah I never knew why he kept taking food down to the basement. Once... once I followed him down there. I hid behind some sacks that I found there. So he wouldn't see me. And then when I heard the noise... ...I was so scared that I knelt down and didn't dare to move. And when he left, he locked the door behind him and muttered: "Your daddy's coming tomorrow". Like he was talking to someone. Hitler's plan was to kill all the halfwits. Except one. He left himself off that plan. I heard these noises of his plenty of times. All you needed to do was put your ear to the floor. Just think about it. Tethered in some filthy basement, like an animal. An animal? At least he was reasonably cheap I guess. I am trying to tell you a story and you keep ruining it. There's nothing funny about it. He must have had longevity since he was locked inside. I won't tell you the story. - Take it easy. Come on! So you knew he was being locked up and beaten like an animal, right? What then? It was easy to come to the conclusion that this was some kind of... ...a monster or something like that. Once, it was on a Sunday, I had been out riding. I came home earlier than I had originally planned. And that's when I realize that the whole family wasn't home. The man, his wife and daughter, they had all gone to church. And that was the opportunity I needed. Listening? I grabbed the key and crept downstairs. I stood outside those doors for a long time and listened. But I didn't hear a thing. Not a sound. I waited there for a long time. Then all of a sudden, suddenly I felt brave. I opened the door, I have no idea why I did it. I...I just had to do it, there was something egging me on. What did you see? He was sleeping. Sat there, tethered to the wall. Chain around his neck. Stark naked and sleeping. Naked? Fucking disgusting. - No. I didn't think he was scary at all. He looked like a large, newborn baby. With a pig's skin. I wanted to vomit. Then he suddenly opened his eyes, those big, child's eyes, and stared at me. I stared back at him. For what reason, I don't know. I don't know. And you know what? Then he moved his hand towards me... ...and looked at me as if he was begging for help. He looked at me and there was something kind and warm in that look. I was at a point where I wanted to walk up to him and help him... ...or free him or do something, and then.. - Then what? Then he smiled. Something came over me, just this utter disgust with the whole situation. Just nauseating. I can't describe it. So I ran for the door, slammed it shut and locked it behind me. Because what I wanted to do was crush him under my feet like a bug... ...I couldn't help myself. You should be a poet. Write all this nonsense down in a book. Nonsense? This ain't no nonsense. This is as true as me sitting here. You wouldn't say stuff like that if you knew what I have had to go through. That autumn, when I was in bed with flu, I saw him again. The gimp? At first I thought... it was God who was sitting there at my desk and watching me. Just like how you are sitting right this moment. Exactly like that. Then he pointed his finger at me and said: You have failed. You are nothing. You turned your back on a helpless halfwit who'd been tortured and beaten. A cowardly act of betrayal. Then God began to cry. But I didn't feel any pity for him. I loathed him. And then he turned into the halfwit. - Who? God? I had betrayed God. But what could you have done? Didn't everybody know that he was kept there? No, it seems like most people didn't know about him. I was forced to swear. Because that day when I ascended from the basement... ...I ran right into the arms of that piece of shit. What did he do to you? What did he do to me? No. That story is too grim to talk about. The man. He made me swear not to tell a living soul about what I had seen. Why have you never told me this story? Because I never thought I would meet him again. What do you mean? He was with us on that boat today. The man on the boat? Have you started hallucinating? - No. It was him. You won't scare me with these kind of stories. I know I left that sweater on the boat. If you'd been on his farm, you would be 150 years old by now. He was about forty back then, that was thirty years ago. And still I often feel... ...like someone is whispering to me... ...Daddy's coming tomorrow. And then it feels like crimes don't exist anymore. At least nothing as terrifying, as serious, as this. Daddy's coming tomorrow. You know, I've heard of a halfwit that the Roman mafia used for... ...robbing blind beggars and... What, have they arrived? - Huh? The girls! Not sure. Did you see anything? - No no. Hang on. What did you see? - Nothing. I'm just imagining things, just imagining. A bird or a fish or a rat or something. Let's go outside and shoot a few rounds, a shooting competition. Tomorrow. No. Now, right now. I'm sure I will easily beat you. Tomorrow! Don't be like that. Remember what you promised. Never while you're drunk. It's all right, really! - All right? Can't you be trusted? Take it easy. Take it easy? Are you planning on staying here, maybe wounded. Wounded in a place like this, trapped! Come on, relax. Let's rather have a drink. OK? Yeah, let's have a drink. D?ri! Hey, I think I saw something. It looked like... what have we here? Sleeping on the floor? Huh? It's time to wake up. Wake up, it isn't good to lie on the floor. Get in your bed, come on. Helgi. D?ri. Wake up D?ri. D?ri? Wake up kid. I'll help you. Try to wake up. This isn't my fault D?ri. Hang on, hang on. I'm going to get help D?ri. Just wait while I get it. Hang on. It will be all right D?ri, it'll be all right. Who's there? Look at him, you can't even imagine the noise he makes. Fucking disgusting. I could puke. I wasn't scared. I just sat there and watched him. Closer, closer. But I wasn't scared, I wasn't scared, I wasn't scared, I wasn't scared. I was just a kid. And he was touching me. Come out, I know you're in there! Come out, or I will come and get you. Did you think I wouldn't catch you? And he wrapped his hands around me and I screamed Daddy and I... ...felt those sweaty fingers go inside me as he pulled me closer...
