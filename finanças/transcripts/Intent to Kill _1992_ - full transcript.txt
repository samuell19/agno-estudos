It's going down. Hi! What? You want an invitation? She's by the limo, stand by. Shit! Okay. Move it! Move it! Move it! [Tires screeching] [Speaking Spanish] Let's go, baby. Come on. Don't you have any class? Let's go, baby. Come on! How about a little bit of champagne before we get to the hotel? Hotel? [Laughs] Baby, this is our hotel. Okay? Okay? You know... [sniffs] You and me, we're gonna be good friends. [Chuckles] See, I pay. You do what I say. [Speaking Spanish] Come on, baby. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Yeah, come on, baby. Come on. Come on. Yeah... Baby... Sweet... Yeah, baby, come on. Hey, you know, I hope we don't go over any bumps, huh? You be careful, sal, you don't wanna make it more bigger. [Clicking] [Speaking Spanish] [Gasps] What is the deal, man? Let's go, let's go! [Tires screeching] Go on, go! [Tires screeching] [Siren blares] [Tires screech] [Men shouting in Spanish] Get out of the car! [Cocking guns] [Sirens blaring] Come out with your hands up in the air! [Grunts] It just doesn't end, does it? [Both] Cover! We live together. We work together. We gotta die together? [Spits] [Man] When will you learn, man, huh? When will you learn? There is business, huh... And there is fuckin' pleasure, huh? Hey, listen, baby, you know, I made, what? Fifty deliveries for you, mooch? And each time, I stop for a little fun, you know? Some pussy. [Speaks Spanish] Just for luck. Ah, for luck, huh? But I guess this time your luck has run out, huh? [Speaking Spanish] [Speaks Spanish] I like your friend, he's so spontaneous, man. That broad was a $50 million hooker. Fifty mil of puro colombiano. Hey, listen, baby, I can't get the money back if I'm dead. You piece of shit. How you expect to get the money? What you gonna do, huh? Rob a bank, huh? Kill them! [Gun cocks] Easy! One week! Just gimme one week! I got people in New York, Miami, Chicago. I'll get your money back. And what if you don't, man? And if I don't, [speaks Spanish] I pull the trigger myself. [Laughs] I would like nothing better for you to blow your brains all over this floor. Al? Hello, shrimp. Hello, Louie. Stevie. You guys know where al is? I think I know where he is. We really should, we should try to get together some time. Anyway, it's a classic, you know? Only four in the world. Yep. I'll give you a ride sometime. That's nice. You gonna get it somewhere else? Right here. I told you. All right, you're really gonna do it, huh? All right, look... I gotta get inside. Bye. Parting is such sweet sorrow. I hate birds. Morning. That time of the month? No, it's not that time of the month. It's that time of the day. You're the only person I know that shaves, showers, and puts on Cologne to get the morning paper. Oh, is this gonna go on the rest of my life, huh? Crucify me. Drive nails in my hands. Why is it... Regardless what time it is, she's out there every time you go out to get the paper? I don't know. Why you askin' me? Ask her. Is this gonna start again? Look, she says good morning, I say good morning. She says, "have a nice day." I say, "you too." It's not like we're screwing in the backseat of my car. Our car. You couldn't afford that without me! Can we not do this today, honey? I had a rough night. You had a rough night. You had a rough night. [Slams drawer] I'm the one that got thrown out of a car! All right, I'm sorry, okay? We had a rough night. Look, if it makes you feel any better, I'll, uh, cancel my subscription to the newspaper. One of these days. [Chuckles] Why did I have to fall in love with such an asshole? See, you do love me. [Man] This was supposed to be a routine sweep on a known carrier. Bombings. Shootings. High speed chases. Killings. My sources tell me that-- your sources were wrong! Thank you for your sources, but you can take those damn people you call informants on another case, before I get everyone in this department killed! You're holding me responsible? Your assignment is over! But the case is still open! Wider than ever, Ms. Stewart, but you're off it. What we have here is a case of three dead Colombians. Here's the list. Start digging. Okay, everyone, back to work. Captain, in all fairness to detective Stewart-- this isn't fair! Nobody said it would be. Now you keep your mouth shut or you'll find your fingers filing fingerprints until your fingers fall off! Now get back to work! Thanks for sticking up for me. I got to stick up for my girl. I was being sarcastic. I'm the one that was thrown out of the damn car last night! It's my job to see it doesn't happen again. I want this guy! I want all of these guys, vickie, all of them! When you put on the blue, and rode shotgun with me-- captain, I know. I learned a lot from you. Almost everything I know. Have you forgotten the most important thing? Have you? To survive. If you can't wake up in the morning and feel the sun in your face and breathe in the fresh air, then we failed. And I don't intend to fail you. I've got one month from retirement. You've got 25 years ahead of you. The fact is, the odds for both of US making it are quite the same. Captain-- no! Go to sgt. Harris. He'll find something for you. Captain! I said no! What's his name? My date? Did he attack you also? Yes, him and his friends. How many were there? Three. No, four. Which is it? Three or four? I don't remember. Do you remember their names? Let's see now, you go out with a guy, and you take his friends along for the ride and you don't know his name? We didn't go for a ride. We stayed at the house. Dressed like that? Why did you go home with them? I said, "why did you go home with them? Because I know them. Obviously, you didn't know them well enough. Address? I already gave you their address. Speak up, miss, I can't hear you! I already gave you their address! Your address. I want your address. What's the difference? Does it really matter? You won't be able to keep 'em in jail. Will you? Off the record? Not the way you're dressed. Why are you on their side? What did I do that makes me wrong? [Vickie] Miss? If you press charges against these men, the lawyers are gonna be a lot harder on you than sgt. Harris. You still wanna press charges? I've already been violated. Why do I need to be violated by you? [Woman] I went inside just to see a friend. One minute we're talking, the next minute, four guys are tearing my clothes off. They hurt me. My friends raped me. [Footsteps] There's two of them now. The other three must be upstairs. Okay. You stay here. I'll be right back. Hey! It's Maria! And she brought a friend this time. Ooh, hoo! She looks better than you, Maria. Ooh, yeah! You broke my nose, bitch! Hey, baby. You come to party? Oh, I sure did. [Snorting] Come on, that's it. Come on in. You swing at me and I'll cut you. I swear I'll cut you. Drop it! Come on. Good girl. I got something to tell you. After. Right now, you just shut your mouth. It's pretty important. After. Take off your pants. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna take from you, baby. What are you gonna take? Everything you got. Why don't you start with this? Pick up the phone. Pick it up! Please don't kill me. Please. Dial 9-1-1. [Al] Hey, where were you? I was worried about you. I called. Nobody was home. How worried were you? All this garlic, and you still smell like a cheap whore. Well, I worked vice tonight, you know? Drove around for seven hours picking up two-bit hookers. What do you want me to do, smell like an altar boy? I wasn't doin' anything. You know, I came home like a good little boy. I've given you one last chance. You blow it, I don't know what I'll do. I don't wanna find out. No, you don't. Wipe the lipstick off your face. Oh, honey, you know how those hookers are. You know, all that shit all over their faces. Hey, I spoke with the captain today. He's still pretty hot. I tried to smooth things out. What the hell did I do wrong? You know, you weren't supposed to get in the limousine. You weren't supposed to do that. I don't deserve to be off this case. I can push it along. I don't know. He thinks you're making it too personal. Well, it is personal. I just wanna do a good job. You're a good detective, vickie, you know? You don't have to try to prove it every day. I just want back on the case. [Cork pops] It'll take some time. [Pouring] Try to work it out, all right? Hungry? Starving. You know I start full-time on day shift tomorrow. I'm on nights. Look, tell you what, every day when you come home for dinner, I'll have a feast ready for you, all right? Thank you, sir. Anything else? Just some privacy, baby, okay? Okay. Thank you. I'd like to thank you for seeing me. I know you're a busy man. We had a business relationship for a number of years. I respect that. If the mooch needs me, I'm here for him. Well, on behalf of mooch and myself, we, uh... Request your services, it seems, uh... A shipment of ours has been delayed and mooch would like for you to loan US your goods for one week. And then? And then... And then... [Speaks Spanish] I give it back. With a percentage of the profit. The profit is a nice gesture, but please, pass this on to the mooch: Not necessary. It would be my pleasure to assist the mooch man in his time of need. So... I pick up the merchandise tonight? Tonight. Good. It was nice meeting you. Thank you for dinner. Do you think that motherfucker's going to check it out? If he does, [Speaks Spanish]. I'll cut off his fucking balls. Sit. You got any brothers or sisters? No. Last night at one o'clock in the morning... Two detectives, they came to visit me at home. They say, "you Roberto melendez?" We just shot your brother 20 times on the street. I'm sorry. I'm gonna need to ask you some questions. If you can help me out, I can help you out when it comes time for the next parole review. Got it? If the people on the outside are anything like those two cops... I'm better off in here. I have nothing to say at this time. I'm mourning the death of my brother. Hey, take it easy, man, cool it! You guys are scarin' me. Why you late, sali? Oh, I had a problem. Why should your problem become my fuckin' problem?! Hey, listen, Holmes, you know, I've been there for you. No, no, you've been there for yourself. Your shipment wasn't delayed, man. You lost it. Hey, that's not what I told you? I told you I lost the shipment. Moochy understands. That ain't what I heard. Oh, what, the streets have stories, huh? Okay you tell me. What you hear? I heard you need a replacement fast. Mooch had you boys on your knees beggin'. Okay, listen, baby, let's cut the bullshit, okay? You wanna do business? Let's do business. I'll give you 15. It's already been sold. 17. No sale, that's the word, Salvador. 19. No! Now get this man outta here. I got business to take care of. 25, my final. 25? [Laughs] Sold! To the lucky Colombian in the thrift shop suit. Now get the man's stash and save his ass from the powerful hand of the mooch. You don't wanna beg for your life, Salvador. I mean, what'd you guys do, huh? Did you have to kiss his ass so he wouldn't pull the trigger? [Laughs] [Both arguing in Spanish] Get down on your knees. Get down on your fuckin' knees! [Speaking Spanish] Like a fuckin' beggar, huh? Is that it, baby, like a fuckin' beggar, huh? That's it, huh? How do you feel now, huh? Beggar, huh? How do you fuckin' feel now, huh? [Speaking Spanish] [Sal speaking Spanish] Don't feel too good, now, don't you? Huh, baby, huh? Do it! Ha! [Speaks Spanish] [Spits] Fuck you! Fuckin' greedy pig. Get the stuff. Let's get the fuck outta here, huh? [Captain] This is your case. The Colombian cowboys are tryin' to make up for that lost shipment. There's a war out there and there's bodies all over. Who cares if these people kill each other? I care! A life is a life! Good or bad. The less blood on the pavement, the more I sleep. And I need my sleep. My phone's been ringing since 4:00 am. The mayor doesn't have your phone number! It's 2-1-3-4-6-4-- and he doesn't want your phone number! It's my ass he chews out at 4:00 am, not yours! That makes your butt my breakfast! Go out there and do your job, just do your job! Captain? What?! Can I put vickie Stewart back on the case? I mean, she can identify these men. Vickie Stewart? [Chuckles] Why? I sent her out on another case. I sent her out to get Phillip Jacobs. [Captain] I get no respect. Philly the pig, huh? She's not gonna like that. What do you think this is, a playground? Get back to work! Mr. Jacobs? What? I'm Mary o'Connor. What? I'm Mary o'Connor. My 10 o'clock. Yeah. I'll be right down. You're gonna like it here. Step into my office. Get back to work! Would you, uh, like a drink? I didn't come here for that. I came here looking for a job. And I'm conducting the interview, not you. You uh... Are you workin' now? If you work here, I'll pay you more than I pay the other girls. If you pay me. I just want a job. I'll give you lots of money if you just take a drink from me every day. Just one drink. Every day. And I'll give you twenty extra dollars. Every day. And twice a day sometimes if I ask for it. I don't understand. I'll make it clear. Here, drink. Oh, close your eyes. Close 'em. Close 'em. Yeah! [Unzips pants] Ah! You stupid bitch! Ah! Get back to work! Ah! You can't go whacking people in the head for no reason. He attacked me. Then why is he coming out of the emergency room and you're dressed as if you're going to noon tea? Were you wired? No. Were there any witnesses? No. He's got two! Number one, you never showed your I.D. And no one seems to remember you showing a badge. He went to attack me. Just like he attacks and rapes innocent women that work for him. You say he went to attack you. Did he attack? His intent was to attack me. And what was your intent, to kill? So he walks. You're lucky the damn judge doesn't throw your ass in jail. The man's guilty. I know he's guilty. You know he's guilty. That damn judge knows he's guilty. The why the hell does he walk?! Because you made him a victim! I want back on the Colombian cowboys case. [Coughs] What is this, a joke? Come on. Take the afternoon off. Just to get your head together. Go to the zoo, go to the beach, go to the park. No, no, don't go to the park! Last time you went to the park, you shot a guy in his leg. He stole a woman's purse. You didn't have to shoot him! He had a gun. He was gonna shoot me! Look, get out of this office. Go home. Get outta here. Now! Go! "He had a gun. He was gonna shoot me." She's driving me to drink. I'm drinking more and more every day. A little bourbon in the afternoon. Every day. I'm gonna take a piss. By the time I get back, I expect this guy to be gone. [Laughs] Oh, my god. Can you believe this guy? I'm terribly sorry about that. I have no idea who he is. [Laughs] That's not justice. I know. But as much as I hate to admit it, he's right. I was just acting like a rookie. Did you know the captain and I were partners? He blew a few collars in his day. It happens. I just let it get personal. I mean, I can't save the whole world. Well, I'm glad somebody's trying. Hey, how is that boyfriend of yours doing? [Both laughing] Oh, god. So I bust in on this guy, right? And he's got his pants around his ankles and he's got one of these blow-up dolls. The ones with the Halloween candy type lips? Exactly, you know the ones I'm talking about? Exactly. So he's got his hands around his doll's, uh... Throat, all right? [Laughing] He's doin' his thing. He's havin' a blast. The neighbors think he's strangling his wife. They call the cops. Well, the doll sure didn't. Oh, god! You sure are a lotta fun, aren't you? I'm a cop, you know? And you're a classy lady. Oh, I'm no classy lady. I'm just a broad who likes cops. Am I ever gonna see you walk down an aisle? I don't know. I mean, the ring, the kids, I want it. I think he wants it, too. What is it, five years? Seven. Seven? If he took care of me the way he takes care of that car... I'd be set. I better get outta here before the captain catches me. What has he got you doin'? Told me to take the afternoon, go to the beach, go to the park. The park? Don't go to the park. Remember what happened the last time? I know. Lock this up for me. Okay. I'll get it later. Take care. [Splash] Boo! [Both laughing] What are you doin' here? I used to live here! Vickie! Vickie! Come here! No, you come here. I don't understand this woman. What the hell's the difference? You got caught anyway. [Laughing] You jerk! [Laughs] [Al] Honey, it's not what you think! It's worse than what I think. Is this what you want? Huh? Is it? Look, it's not what you think! Not my car. It's ours. What are you, nuts? What are you doin'? No, not my car! No, no, no, no, not my car! Bitch! Fuck! Damn it! Never know what's gonna happen when you wake up in the morning, huh? Hey, uh... Give you a call? No. But have a good life. [Woman] ♪ when the dream comes down ♪ ♪ on this blackened town ♪ ♪ the sun has gone... ♪ You put his car on fire. Stewart, I like your style. The lowlife deserved it. Hey, I'm on your side. I'm only sayin' I wish I was there for the fireworks. It was better than any 4th of July I remember. Listen... I've got a guest room. Well, it's not really a guest room, but it's a nice, clean place, and it's got a bed. You can hang up your clothes and... You're welcome to it. Thanks. I'll think about it. How about the Colombian cowboys? Hey, slow down. You break Philly the pig's wrist. You almost blind him by putting out his left eye. You blow up your boyfriend's car-- ex! Ex-boyfriend's car, and now you want me to send you out to chase a lunatic who threw you out of a moving limousine. Yeah. We'll think about it in the morning. Now how about that room for a nice night's sleep? I think I have a place. If it doesn't work out, can I call you? Anytime. Anytime, kid. Not bad. Not bad, but you're still shy. It's not all here. I still got a few days before the week's out. Don't go loading no gun for my head yet, mooch, huh? It's not me gonna be loading the gun. I still got a few plays left. I get it any way I have to. No more junk. The word on the street is that I authorized this sweep. The streets lie. Yeah, in the streets they know no truths. What they do know is, they are a lot of dead bodies laying out there, and I have their junk. This doesn't make me look very honorable. You work for me. If you make a hit, it's as if I made the hit. You know, baby, we don't need them. [Laughs] Oh, we don't need them. What you gonna do, huh? Go door-to-door personally like a fuckin' avon lady? You idiot, huh? You second class citizen. You lowlife degenerate who should have been left in the old country under a cow pullin' on its tits. Pullin' the leche, and squeezin' the nipples. I told you I'd get the shit back. I got it, didn't I? Half, you piece of shit! Half. You're halfway home. You know you're gonna get the rest. You listen to me, you fuckin' cockroach, I don't care how you do it, you and your buddy here, huh? Mr. Spontaneous. But you get the rest and you leave the other suppliers alone. Okay. Okay. [Man] Will you stop working already? You're doing the work of tomorrow morning's shift. Papa, it's just in my nature. Sweetheart, about what you were talking about... Would you stop it already? [Vickie] Hello? You didn't lock the door? No. Vickie! What are you doing here? How'd you know where to find me? Got your address off the police report. You work here? No, she owns the place. Papa, this is detective Stewart of the LAPD. Remember? It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gonzales. My father was Mr. Gonzales. I'm Nick. Bullshit with the formalities. Come on, let's have a drink. That's my papa. I used to have an old friend that used to say, "after a hard day's work, "there's nothing like a good drink." Who said that? Me! [Laughs] My daughter, she's all I have left. Her, and this business. When I heard what those animals did, I wanted to... But I believe in justice. I just want her to come home and live with me, that's all. Maybe talk some sense into her-- papa, don't start! Hey, just for a few months, huh? Just till after the trial. I haven't lived at home since I was 18. Hey, it'll be fun, huh? It'll be fun for you. You sound just like your mother, may she rest in peace. I might have a solution that'll make you both happy. Talk some sense into him. Tell her I'm right. You're afraid of her living alone, right? Wouldn't you be? Absolutely. You see? So if she wasn't living alone, she could live on her own, right? All I want her to be is happy. She's suffered enough. And it would make me happy to stay. I just got off the phone with my father. How is he? He sends his love. And that's from him, too. He says stay as long as you like. And so do I. Thanks. You sleep all right? Yeah. It was great. It's the first time I've slept in years without worrying if I'd wake up and not find al there. God, I was so stupid. We're all stupid when we love. That's it. It's over with. We'll see. No, that's it. God, I hope that's it. Me too. Do you have anybody special? Nope. I gave up looking a long time ago. If it happens, it happens. [Sighs] I'm done with the bar scenes, the nightclubs... I'm over it. You have to work today? No. Finally a day off. Come on. Where are we going? Let's get dressed. You're a victim only because you don't know how to defend yourself. Crime, murders, rape. Even gunfire's a common occurrence in today's neighborhoods. You have two main defenses we're here to learn today. Number one is your intelligence and observation. Stay out of unlit parking lots. Lock your windows and doors. Use your common sense and be smart. Number two is knowing your strength and your attacker's weaknesses. Just because you're small, doesn't mean you don't have strength. Tom. The attacker in most cases grabs you from behind. He does this so you can't see his face. A rolled up magazine is a great weapon on the street. I hear you're available. I'll see you next week. Don't forget, tell your friends. It's free, compliments of your local police department. You know, you sound just like fluffy, the crimestopper dog. "Compliments of your local police department." Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf! Are you making fun of me? I only make fun of people I like. You wanna get a cup of coffee? Why? Since you don't have a boyfriend... Word travels fast. Like fire. Every time I see you, you ask me out. If I was going out with someone like you I wouldn't even look at another girl. Oh, spare me, Tom. What, you don't believe me? I just want an original line once from a guy. All set? Ready? Hi! Tom. I'm vickie's new boyfriend. [Chuckles] That's original. Maria, this is detective Tom Martin. Tom and I went through the academy together. Yeah, vickie's always been lookin' for a big brother, and I've been lookin' for a date. Well, maybe now you can both have your way. I've got some things to do. Should I drop you at the house, or do you wanna come along? Or, I could drop you off at the house, after coffee. Will you be all right? I'll be fine. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, too. Have her home by 11 o'clock or I'm callin' the cops. Coffee? After the fight. What fight? What was that all about? How about dinner instead of just coffee? Why? I just won a hundred bucks. You didn't have to get your face beaten in. I don't eat that much. You sure you have the energy for dinner? Absolutely. I'm gonna make this a night you'll never forget. I know just the right place. [Woman] Enjoy your dinner. [Tom] So why'd you stay with him so long? [Vickie] I'll probably spend a long time on that one. Let's leave it for my therapist. Seven years off and on... That's a long time. We used to laugh a lot. I guess over the years, the laughter just sorta stopped. What about love? What about it? Do you still love him? I don't think you ever stop loving somebody you've loved for so long. You know it just doesn't work that way. That's pretty dangerous. So is wakin' up in the morning. Good evening, gentlemen, dinner for three? You all cooperate, no one'll get hurt. Please, oh, god, don't hurt anybody. I'll give you all the money out of the cash register. You got $100,000? [Man] Where's your husband? [Woman, sobbing] He's in the kitchen. [Man] Hit the office safe. [Crying] You have two children, don't you? Why? Just answer the question. I have a boy and a girl. Who are you? What do you want? You owe the man, Nicky, baby. Big time. [Nick] I'll pay you. I promise I'll pay you! He ain't gonna listen, Nick. Too late for that. You son of a bitch, Nicky! Shut up! I'll get it. Tell him I'll get it. You hear me? He ain't gonna wait no longer. Sir, stand up. [Nick] Don't! How was your last meal? I'm tellin' you, believe me, Nicky, this is not good for business. Every week you don't pay me, I come in here and get a boy and I get a girl. In one week, it's gonna be your children. You! Stand up. [Nick] No, not again! No! Not again! Please. Kill me. If I kill you, who's gonna pay the money? Kill me! I'll give you all my money. I don't want your money. I want your life. It's not on the menu. [Woman] Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Aren't you gonna help me? You're doin' fine. You're doin' fine. Get up, get up! You okay? [Siren blares] Stay down. Go, go! Down. Down! Now you help me. I didn't bring my gun, okay? I thought we were just going out to dinner. Are you gonna be all right? I just can't get used to it. Thank god you can't get used to it. Oh. You all right? Where the hell have you been? Like you give a shit! I've been up all night worried sick about you! Let go! Get the fuck away from my car! I'm sorry. All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Okay? Damn it! Can we...? I don't wanna lose you, vickie. You've already lost me. Don't say that, all right? We can work it out, all right. I've done some stupid things. I still love you. Roberto melendez. Yeah, county corrections, all right, thank you, goodbye. Vickie, message. Hey, what the hell was all that about? Roberto melendez, county corrections, something like that. What do I look like? A blue... That's my recommendation. Let's say you're right. Let's say she is holding something, information through Roberto melendez. I think internal affairs should be told. This has nothing to do with your personal life or the fact that you couldn't get melendez to talk? This has nothing to do with that situation. I think she should turn over the information she has and be suspended. Well, let me tell you what I think. Let's say she is withholding information. Maybe this internal affairs bullshit might refuel her fire. Let's put her back out on the street. Put a tail on her. Maybe something might happen to her out on the street that could... I'll take care of it. Good. You take care of it. She has me drinking. Let's go. We're working tonight. Didn't you have enough fun last night? Listen, just one more time, all right? You take orders from me. Got it? I take 'em from the captain. And he takes 'em from god. Or whatever else they consider themselves. What have we got goin'? We're shadowing vickie Stewart. Following detective Stewart? Is this part of a case? Or is this part of you? My orders. I think she should be told. Keep your mouth shut, and do as you're told. Look, if she's in danger, she oughta be told what's goin' on. You're not asked to think, officer Martin. You can be officer Martin very quickly. Detectives do get turned into officers again. Easily. Is that a threat? It's a fact. No. Fact is you've got a problem with this. I don't think you'd be the best protection for detective Stewart. So, so, so, so, what are you sayin' then? You don't think I'm gonna do a good job? You think I won't protect her when something goes down? That's exactly what I'm sayin'. You don't get it, do you? You don't fuckin' get it!
