Hey, where is he? You're sleeping well, huh? Do we have to do this? Wake up. Hey. Here's your passport, and here's the car key. - Enjoy your trip and have fun for us, too. - Yes. You might be drunk but you can't use that as an excuse to grab the stewardess' boobs, all right? - Let's go. - What a bastard. - Later. Bye-bye. - See you. - To Aey's house. - Let's get wasted at Aey's house. Come on. - Wait. - Let's go! Damn, I'm so handsome. Let's go. Back up. Honey, I'll get going now. Bye. Where's your passport? Don't forget it. It's here. Don't worry. See you. How about your money? I already put it in different places like you told me to. Don't worry. Where's your gum? Why do I need that? To pop it into your ears while you're on the plane. I will buy it inside. Don't worry. Meow is going with me. Just a second. We're still waiting for one more person. What are you guys waiting for? We're going to miss the flight. DUMPED Hey, Puak. What the hell did you do? Why did you write that on my forehead? Girl, stop messing around. Why are you laughing? Stop laughing. You bastard. Meow, I'm serious, okay? - Yes. - Jim can't find out. He must think that I'm going to Korea with you, okay? Okay, my ass. My luggage is in Shin's car. I'm wearing the only underwear I have. What will I do? Come on. It's just for seven to eight days. Fine. I'll buy you makeup as a souvenir. Sweetie, why did you kick her seat? Can't you see you woke her up? You're so naughty. We have just landed at Incheon International Airport in Seoul. The time here is two hours ahead of Thailand. The temperature outside is approximately 0 degree Celsius. Daddy. Follow me, please. This way. This way. Be careful. This way. Your outfit is adorable. After you. Let's go! Slowly get off the bus and come this way. Come closer. Closer, please. Ready? Let's shout together. One, two, three. - Kimchi! - Kimchi! - Kimchi! - Kimchi! That gentleman killed the pose. Come. Let's take a picture over there. Mister, can you take a picture for us? Sure. Of course. Okay. Are you ready? Okay… Are you ready? Okay. - One, two… - Babe. - Yes. - Are you sure about this pose? It's so lame. - Is this pose better? - Oh, my god. - Are you crazy? What are you doing? - Are you ready? You should bend your knees down a little. I want to see the roof in the back, too. All right, then. Actually, forget it. Just take a half-body picture of us. A half-body picture? Again. - Okay. - Smile. One, two, three. That was good. - Thank you. - Thank you. And now we are here at the Coffee Prince Café. This is where Gong Yoo kissed the main actress for the first time. It was very romantic. Let me see. Is there anyone pretending to be a boy like the actress did in Coffee Prince? Here comes my coffee. Thank you. Thank you. Finally, I get to taste it from the very same cafe. Shit! It's hot! Here in Korea, if a couple comes up to Seoul Tower, locks a lock together, and throws away the key, they believe that no one can ever tear them apart. Are you ready? - Yes! - Yes! If you're ready, throw it now! - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, won't it hit all those people down there? All right. Well… We better go to the Teddy Bear Museum downstairs. Let's go. Everybody, this way, please. And here is the location where the series Princess Hours took place. This way, please. Babe, I hooked our locks together. We'll be together forever. Are you guys tired from today's activities? - Not at all! - Not at all! That's awesome. Tomorrow, we have to wake up early since we'll be going out of town. We have to wake up at six, eat at seven, and leave at eight. So remember this simple code… - Six, seven, eight! - Six, seven, eight! What did you say? - Six, seven, eight! - Six, seven, eight! Again! - Six, seven, eight! - Six, seven, eight! Excellent! Give yourself a round of applause. Shit! What the fuck! What is this shit? How do you stop this? Stop! Here you go. Eat a lot. Yes. Yes. Just eat it. Everything here is good. Just eat a lot. She just nods at everything I say. Our ingredients are healthy. What meat is this? Here. Look. It's this. What the fuck! Shit! I'm not eating it anymore. Shit. Hey. Hey. Hey. Damn. Oh, shit! Shit. The bus is leaving soon. - Oh, my god. - Hey. Hey! That's my jacket. Are you Thai? - Why didn't you say so? - What? I have to go. Hey, are you familiar with this hotel? The Grand Ambassador. Yes, I just walked past it yesterday. How do I get there? It's not too far from here. When you walk out, turn right. You will see a fish-bread shop on your left. Make another right. Walk into the subway station and get out at Exit No. 3. Exit No. 3, all right? If you get out at the wrong exit, I wouldn't be able to help you. Once you come up, then it's very easy. You'll find a sock stand with celebrity faces on them. They're having a sale. Cross the street and go straight then turn left. Make another right and you'll see it. Wow, were you born here or is your husband Korean? - How can I remember all that? - What? Look. Fish-bread, Exit No. 3, and socks on sale. It's not that difficult. Bread on sale, exit No.3, fish on socks. Fish-bread, Exit No. 3, socks… Stop. I won't remember all of that. Take me there instead. Can you please hurry up? Are you Martha Stewart? Stop eating. How inconsiderate of you to do that. You know I'm in a hurry. Why are you in such a hurry? We are here. All right. Is everyone already here? - Yes! - Yes! Are we missing anyone? - No, we're not! - No, we're not! Since everyone is here, let's get our day started. - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, you! Where are we? It's like a castle from the dark ages. Here we are at the Grand… Embassy. She said your tour group left two hours ago. How could that be? Yes, call her now. Knock, knock. Wake up, everybody. We are now heading to Seoraksan National Park. Wait a minute. Hello. What? They can't come back for me? Why? They said your tour is already in another town. They can come back to get you the day after tomorrow. What? What kind of service is this? Once I'm back home, I will sue them and get my money back. I'll put them out of business. Damn it! Hey, wait a minute. Come back. Hey. You can just go sightseeing around Seoul now. It's just two days. I'll get going then. Good luck. I… Why are you following me? I'm coming with you. This is your fault. If you took me to the right hotel, I would be with my tour group. You're the one who asked for my help. Why did you say you knew where my hotel is when really you didn't? Won't you take any responsibility? - Do you want money? - No. - Are you a con artist? - What's wrong with you? What the heck? Hey. What's wrong with you? This is getting out of hand. Wait. Hey! What's wrong with you? Hey. Don't go. Wait for me. Damn it. No. Hey. Hey, wait for me! I'm not a thief. Please help me. What "no"? I haven't said a word to you. - Hey, we are both Thai. - Get out. Just get out. - "Datka"? I don't get it. - What? Don't "What?" me. I should be the one saying that to you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Where are you taking me? - Thank you. - Okay. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Why did you apologize? I did nothing wrong. They arrested me for no reason. Can I ask you something? Are you crazy or what? Why do you have to follow me like this? Well… - I don't want to eat dogs anymore. - What? Well, I can't speak English. I don't know where to go, or how to order any food. Yesterday, I almost ate dog meat. It's my first time being abroad. Let me tag along with you, please. - I don't know anyone here. - Stop talking. Give my money back. Gosh, it's just 1,000 won. That's only 30 baht. What is our itinerary for today? I'm not your guide. I will only let you tag along today and I'll take you back in the evening. Then we're done. Do you understand? Do you think I look like Michael Jackson? So, are you traveling alone? - Yes. - Wow, so artist-like. Why? I am traveling alone, too. You came on a tour by yourself? Why? What's wrong with that? You also came here alone. Fine. Nothing's wrong with that. What did you say? Should we change seats? I can't focus on my reading. Let's switch. Come sit here. Have you got a name? Why are you asking? Do you like me? Here. Which one do you want? No, thanks. I don't drink soda. My boyfriend got one of those emails that says if we put a coin inside a soda can, the coin will soon disappear. - Really? - Yes. How come? Did someone take the coin? Hey, you. This island is called "Tsunami," right? - It's "Nami." - I see. So is it not "Tsunami"? Do you think that's so funny? Well, actually, this island is nice. This is better than where my tour took me. They took me to all these TV series locations. How lame. Wait for me. Whose statues are they? Are they the ones who own the island? It's Bae Yong-joon. Oh, my god. Take it. - Take a good one. - One, two, three. Here we go again. Are they here because of a TV series? Let's take a picture over there. If there weren't any TV series in Korea, would there be any tourists? Oh, my god. Oh, so she's also a big fanatic herself. What are you doing? You can go back to the hotel first. I won't mind at all. All right. I'm sorry. Who is this guy? - Bae Yong-joon. - Bae Yong-joon? He's good looking. The only downside is… his acting is a bit stiff. See? It's so stiff. Seriously, I never understood Korean TV fanatics like you. Watching movies that make you cry as if someone just died. Stories of babies switched at birth or people falling in love after a few days of meeting. Plots where women pretend to be men but no one seems to notice. And meeting some guy who's actually a royal person. That is from Taddao Bussaya. Whatever. It's the same thing. How can you watch all those corny Korean TV series? I think they're so over the top. "Over the top"? Don't you know the word "romantic"? All women are like that. They don't get the difference between romantic and cheesy. What if the main couple looks like them? Would it still be romantic? It has nothing to do with how they look. Do you judge people from their appearance? I find it cute how Korean couples wear matching clothes. They want people to know that he nailed her. Does it feel cool to be a jerk? Move. You're in the way. You're so mean. Oh… Hello. I'm Bae Yong-joon, the most romantic actor. I love you all. Oh, baby. Please don't be mad. It's just part of the job. Sweetie. Sweetie, do you want a picture with me? No problem. Let me freshen up a little. Make sure that everything is in order. Oh, look. A nose hair. Quite tasty. Let's take a picture together. One, two, three. I'm cute. One, two, three. Click. Please don't forget that I love you all! Hey, I just told you not to be upset. You're getting mad again. Oh, now I'm starting to fall for myself, too. Wow. Gosh, he's so sexy. I think I'm falling in love with Bae Yong-joon now. Let me nibble on your ear. My timing was off. Hey. There is only one ticket left. You can go back first. I will give you directions. Are you trying to ditch me? No way, I'll wait for you here. JIM Well, well. She's got something to hide. Hello, babe. How is it going? What are you doing? I'm about to watch a show with Meow. Remember the show I've told you about? There are so many people here. I'm lucky that there was one available ticket left. Then what about Meow? Didn't you say you were going with Meow? Yes, but she already got her ticket from the internet. Why didn't you book it together? I didn't think of that. Babe, the show is about to start. Wait a second. Hey, Meow. Don't rush me, I'm coming. Hello, babe. I have to go. I have to hang up now. Meow, wait up! So am I Meow now? Don't ask too many questions, okay? Keep this for me. I can't bring it inside. What? Hello, Goi. Can I talk to you? Hey. You missed a great show. The show was really awesome. In the beginning, the main actor wore glasses like a nerd but he was adorable. When he took off his glasses, he acted like he got electrocuted. Like this. Then, he became a playboy. He flirted with everyone. But it was so funny when he got electrocuted. What are you doing? - It's not funny. - It is. He got electrocuted like this. You're right. It's funny. Give my camera back. - What happened next? Don't stop. - Forget it. Oh, come on. And at the very end, the main actor climbed a wall then did triple somersaults. Like that. They're just somersaults. What's so cool about that? You talk like you can do it. Why can't I? Why does it always have to be you versus the world? If you want to do something, just do it. Nobody knows you here. They are all Korean. You know me and you're sitting here. Do I really know you? I don't even know your name. It seems like the money you paid for your flight was not well-spent. We're not in our country. We can do or say whatever we want because no one would understand us. Just watch me. Mister. Mister. Hello, mister. Yes, you. Come here, please. He's so smiley. Mister. You know, your food really sucks. Even a dog can't eat it. Can you believe that it's so disgusting, even a dog would throw up after eating it? Did you serve me dog vomit? Mister, you should pursue more creative things, like polishing shoes. Just don't be a cook anymore, please. All right. You can leave now. - Thank you. - Sure. Please wait a second. This is good. What kind of a man are you? And what kind of a woman are you? You lied to your boyfriend about traveling alone. That's my business. Yes, you are right. It's your own business. Actually, whether you're here to have an affair, find a new guy, or to have sex with someone, it's none of my business. An affair? I'm here for my friend's wedding! If your midget boyfriend catches you lying, - he would be really mad! - How did you know that he was short… - Small? - Small? Just small, huh? Based on the picture, it looked like he was sitting down. Did you take a look at the pictures in my camera? - Yes. - Don't you even know the word manners? No wonder nobody wants you. Hey, how could you say that? Excuse me, but I do have a girlfriend. Where is she, then? - We broke up. - Oh, does it hurt? - Hurt? Hell, no! - Come on. At least, I'm not a control freak like your half-pint boyfriend who keeps calling to say "Hello, babe. Please don't drink any soda. It's very dangerous. Recently, I dropped an iron in the soda, and the whole thing disappeared! Damn. - My shirts have been wrinkled for days." - So what? He's worried about me. Sure, if you say so. Shit, what the fuck is this? I don't care if it's free. Take it back. I'm not eating it. No. I'm not eating. It's not good, mister! It's still alive. Mister, just take it back. Mister! - Mister! - Hey. Come on. We're already in Korea. You can't not eat it. If you eat that, I will drink a glass of Soju. Oh, wow, one glass. If I agree to eat this dancing octopus, you must drink at least one bottle. Deal! But you have to eat the whole thing alive from that tank. Are you backing down? What a pussy. Pussy, pussy, pussy… What? Do you hear a pussy? Pussy… Mister. Get me one of those. Wow, it looks like the one from Pirates of the Caribbean. Oh, my god. It's so tasty, even the flavor sticks to my mouth. You're really something. Ouch. Shit, it hurts. It hurts. Now, it's your turn. Bottoms up. Holy shit! Do you need to use the restroom? Wait. I'm almost done peeing. What? What was that? - Bastard! - Hey. - Asshole! - Listen. Pervert! - Jerk! - What's going on? Wait. I didn't lay a hand on you. Why am I dressed like this? How should I know? You were complaining about how hot you were. Then you started stripping. That's not true. - Jerk! You… - I'm kidding. How would I know what you did? Maybe you fell asleep when you're about to shower. Seeing how that shower cap is on your head. Last night was such a blast, huh? Catwoman. - Faster. - Sure. Hey, faster! Be sexier. - Sexy. - Be sexier. Are those elephant ears? They are huge. I'm pretty, right? - Look. - Damn. I'm screwed. If Jim sees this, I'll be dead meat. JIM 107 MISSED CALLS Whoa! You got 107 missed calls from Jim. You better call him back now, maybe somebody died. If anyone is going to die, it will be me. Is your boyfriend psychotic or something? Shit! Hello, babe. What's up? Why didn't you pick up my calls? Oh, it was on silent so I didn't hear it. Were you drinking? No, I wasn't. Are you sure? Well, Meow invited me so I just drank a little to be polite. Meow, huh? So did Meow telepathically invite you from Thailand? I just met Meow yesterday at Central Mall. Which branch? Don't change the subject. Do you think I'm dumb? Why did you lie to me? It's not like that. I just wanted to attend Min Ah's wedding. And no one was free to come with me. So you had to lie to me? - I'm sorry. - And this stupid wedding, is it that important? They can still get married without you. See? If I honestly told you, you wouldn't have let me come here. So it's my fault? You have to find a flight back. The earliest one you can find. Calm down, babe. - Hey. -I… I'm telling you to come back but you won't. Are you with someone? You're going too far now. Please calm down. - It's actually0 - Aren't we speaking the same language? I said, come back now. If you don't, we are over! Over? Will you break up with me over such a small thing? What's wrong now? You can't think of any more lies, huh? I'm so sick and tired of taking care of an idiotic woman like you. How stupid. You bring me problems every day. You are the stupidest and the most boring girl I have ever dated! Fine. I'm so damn bored of you, too! Do you know why I had to lie? Because I'm with a brainless, psychotic guy like you. Let's break up. Watch me. From now on, I will drink a ton of Pepsi. I will watch Korean series all night long. I will walk around Korea wearing a bikini. I will be slutty now! You, fucking dwarf! Psychopath! I'm not your slave! - That's good. Just let it all out. - Watch me! I will wear high heels every day! That's good. I will wear them with you! But I'm not sure about the size. Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Wow! Oh, my god. Hold on. - Wait. - What? - What? - I'm tired. It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Are you really going to lay down like that? Do you think these are the same stars we see in Bangkok? I'm not sure. I guess not. Why? Do you miss Bangkok? If you caught your girlfriend lying to you, would you break up with her? How do you want me to answer? Girls are hard to understand. If I say the wrong thing, you'll be mad at me. - It's not that difficult. - Sure. Have you ever listened to Parn Thanaporn's song? - Parn Thanaporn? - Yes. She has this one song that is extremely deep. It goes like this. "Women don't like watching soccer but they will watch it to keep men company. Some might not know how to wear makeup but they'll still put on a little blush." Hang on. - What's wrong? - I feel like puking. Hey. You kicked me pretty hard. You should go back and talk to him nicely. Everything will be okay. Have you ever seen snow? How could I? The farthest I had been was the casino in Poipet. If you saw real snow for the first time, what would you do? Eat it. Actually, no. I would spell my name out with my pee. Isn't that cool? What about you? I want to get naked in the snow. I want to know how cold it can be. Whoa, that's R-rated! I once told Jim about this before. He said that I was being ridiculous. Hey, your group tour is here. You're right. Hey. We still don't know each other's names. That's right. So what's your name? I won't tell you. So when you go back, you can't gossip about all the crazy things I have done. For real? All right, then. I have to go. It was nice knowing you. Actually, no. It was nice not knowing you. Nice not knowing you, too. Please give a round of applause for the return of our group member. How's everyone? We're now back to Seoul. The weather is a lot warmer, right? Unlike the ski slope yesterday. What was it? It was freezing cold. It was, wasn't it? Luckily, this year's April still has snow left for us to enjoy. Okay, let's do this. Who saw their first snow on this trip? Raise your hand. Very nice. How was it? - It was cold. - Wow. Hey. Did you forget something? No. I've been told that It's still snowing. Both of us have never seen snow, right? Shall we see them? Let's go! GO BY THE BOOK So, what's your name? You can tell me now. Give it a guess. All right. I think someone like you should be named "May." - Why? - May the drunkenness be with you. What kind of girl gets drunk and suddenly bends his back? Is that the best you've got? That really hurts. Then, your name must be - "John." - Why? - Do I look Caucasian? - John-doe. What kind of crazy person sleeps on the street like a dog? Oh, a dog. That's very creative. I think it's better that we don't know each other's names. Why? Didn't you say that we can do anything here? Nobody knows us. - So what? - If we knew each other, we would have to care about each other's feelings. For example, if you were my friend I wouldn't dare speak my mind like I just did. I see. So that means I can say whatever I want and you won't get mad. - That's right. - You have a mustache, donkey ears, flat chest, thick body, short legs, huge butt, dirty elbows, ashy knees, and monkey face. I'm not mad. You have a dog's brain. You're dumb. All your relatives must be dead. Are you mad at me now? - I'm not. - All right. It is fun. Fuck you. Hey, gosh! Oh, my god. Gosh! Will we be all right? COMPOUND VENDING MACHINE FOR ADULT GOODS Here's your room. Right. Okay, okay. These? - No. - No. These ones? Like that. - I… - Stay quiet. I'll do the talking. Two keys. - Click. - I see. - Yes. - Click. Do you mean these? You know what? We'll sleep in the same room. The bed here is very wide. Yes. But it's too short. Should I just sleep on the floor? Are you sure? I don't want to be unfair. Please be. I'm out of here. It's insane that they only have one room left. Is it Valentine's Day or what? Everyone just wants to screw here. Can I ask you something? - What is it? - How many girlfriends have you had? - Why are you asking? - I'm just curious. Well… - Three. - I see. What about you? Jim must be your first. My first love - was nothing like Jim. - How so? - It was a girl. - What? My mom doesn't even know about this. I was in an all-girl school, right? My hair was short. Then this girl became obsessed over me. So I gave it a try. So what have you tried? Pervert! I tried being with a girl. Whoa! As in with her? - In every position? - I only dated her. When I was in 9th grade, I used to date this girl. We met at a tutorial school. She was really sexy. She always wore spaghetti straps to class. But when we got on the bus, she held the rail, her armpit hair was this long. When the wind blew, it fluttered in the air. Oh, my god. I couldn't take it. So I broke up with her. It was the grossest break up ever. It's better than doing it over the phone. And being away like this, there's no one to talk to either. If I were in Bangkok, I could at least talk to DJ Aoy and Chod. - Who? - DJ Aoy and Chod from Club Friday. Have you listened to them? People call them for advice about love. How can a DJ help you? They'll just say anything. They'll just get paid and go home. Some things are easier to share with a stranger. Really? What did you tell them? Don't laugh, okay? Sure. A while back, Jim was really into detoxification. So he forced me to do it, too. And that means… I had to have an enema. I didn't understand why he wanted me to have an enema that badly. - And did you? - Of course. So I called the DJs thinking he might have been psychotic. That's enough about me. Tell me your story. - About what? - About your girlfriend. How did you break up? It was nothing special. - It was just a normal break up. - Don't be like that. I told you so much about me. Do you really want to know? I… got her pregnant. I wasn't ready, then. So, I… told her to get an abortion. But she wouldn't do it. So I pushed her down the stairs hoping the baby would die. But it turned out they both died. Gotcha! Did I get you? I'm just kidding. Don't be so serious. How could you joke about stuff like that? I had two abortions. Those were the saddest times of my life. Every night, I still have nightmares. - Gotcha! - Yes. Gotcha. Okay. Min Ah. Are you sure? She didn't invite me. It's fine. I invited you. Well, Min Ah. There they are. - Yes. - I see. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Darng? - Darng? - Darng. Here. Have some Soju. Your hand. How do I explain this? Ta-da. Dinner is served. It's the black bean noodles. - Here. - Thank you. Jajangmyeon. - Try eating it. - Try it. I just handed her the ingredients. Well, that's what I thought. Everything is delicious. - Yes. - Yes, Dae Jang-geum. He knows Dae Jang-geum. - Nichkhun? - Yes. From 2PM, right? Thailand. Tony Jaa. "Where's my elephant?" "Where's my elephant?" - Oh, no. - Oh, my god. Look at her go. Put your hands down. Where's Min Ah? She's sleeping. She wants to look pretty tomorrow. Have you known Min Ah for a long time? No, I just met her last New Year. You guys seem very close. At that time, I went to try the Fish Pedicures in Chiang Mai. Min Ah was sitting next to me. She started making this really weird noise loudly. Everyone was looking at her. What kind of noise? Like… - Like that. Yeah. - Really? If she could moan like that, she doesn't need to get married anymore. Just buy those fish and call it a night. Have you ever read the book Doing Fish? Is there one? Oh, my god. Min Ah is a very lovely person. - Yes. - She's very talkative. We talked through email since then. You easily make friends, don't you? Hey, have you ever felt really close to somebody that you just met? You can talk about anything. Yes. You know what? I was in Chiang Mai last New Year, too. - Which area? - Around Nimman road. Nimman. Did you go with friends? - No. - Who did you go with? I went with Goi. She's my ex-girlfriend. If you don't walk to talk about her, it's okay. I'll go to bed now. Okay. Hey, can I borrow your phone? Sure. Hello. Here. - She didn't pick up? - She did. But she won't talk to me. Do you want to call DJ Aoy and Chod? They might be able to help. What? It works. I'll call them for you. Hello. Are you DJ Aoy and Chod? Just a second. - Here. - What the hell? Hurry up. It's a long-distance call. Hurry. Hello. What's your name? Your name is Darng. How can we help with your problem today? What are you doing? Please speak up. You're now on air. Hello. Hello, are you still there? Hello? Please turn down your radio volume and just listen from your phone. - Hello, are you still there? - Fine. Well… I dated this girl for eight years and she dumped me. Can you help me with anything? I see. Maybe we can, if you stop being such a pain in the ass. And did she tell you why she wanted to break up with you? Well… She wanted to get married but I didn't want to. I see. Why not? Why didn't you want to get married? - Don't you love her anymore? - It has nothing to do with love. People get married and get divorced all the time. Weddings don't guarantee love. - She had no right to break up with me. - I see. Firstly, Darng, you must not yell at us because it scares us. So which one are you? DJ Aoy or DJ Chod? So what's really the problem here? Well… Will someone like me ever get married? How can I take care of anyone? I can't even wipe and clean my own ass. - It's just a metaphor. - Oh, I see. Well, Darng. You were the one who chose not to get married, right? So why are you still calling her? Well… Nothing. I just feel like calling her. You just feel like calling her. You know, we're not in third grade anymore. No answer? For our listeners out there, send us a text to guess what he did. Press 1, Darng called to get her back. Press 2, Darng called to curse at her mom. I'm done with this game. This isn't helping at all. Because you didn't speak frankly, DJ Aoy and Chod couldn't help you. You couldn't give her what she wanted so she broke up with you. That's fair enough. What else do you want from her? Just let her go. Stop calling her already. I can't do that. I haven't got the chance to tell her that I want to marry her now. Hey! Are you for real? What happened to DJ Aoy and Chod? Well, Darng. You're planning to propose to her. Does this mean you know how to clean your ass now? I still don't know how, - but I will try. - Wow. You can be romantic, too. So what if I'm romantic? She won't even speak to me. If she doesn't want to talk, then just write to her. Write to her. She will be so happy when she finds out. TO GOI WILL YOU MARRY ME? Hey, should I buy this as a wedding present for Min Ah? You're going to buy a Korean souvenir for a Korean. I don't know what to get her. This is hard. Gosh, he came to haunt us here, too. I will change it when I get back. I'll get going then. Who were they? My friends. Min Ah looks so happy. Goi probably feels the same. She's marrying someone else. - Four. - Four. - Five. - Five. - Six. - Six. - Seven. - Seven. Oh, no. You can't even do that? Come on. Come on, man! It's okay if you can't do it. - What? - Come back. - Come out. - More. More. Come here. Come out. Come out. I said more! - Come with me. I'm sorry. - More! Come with me. I just wanted him to carry her some more. - Is that the best you've got? - Hey. - Come on, man. - Calm down. It might not be true. - Should you call her again? - Can you stay out of this? Didn't you see what happened? You told me to write to her and propose. Now she's marrying someone else. How romantic is that? Damn it! Are you out of money? Use this. Not the silent treatment, please. I would rather have you yell at me. It's not your fault. She'll get married anyway. I'm such an idiot. We broke up a while ago but I still had hope. You know, we bought this tour together before we broke up. I came here hoping that she might come. Who on earth would come? I'm so damn stupid. You know, brokenhearted people always do stupid things. Look at me, I yelled out loud at the bridge. This damn machine keeps taking my money. I just can't win. What is that granny so happy about? This's probably her first win ever. - I'm done. This is boring. - Hey, wait. That 10,000 bill was mine, you know. Shouldn't you get it back for me? Slots are for old people. The real fun is over there, shall we? Will it be black or red? If I knew, I would be rich already. I bet black. Come on, black. - Black! - Black! Black, black, black. It's okay. Let's try again. Which color this time? - Red. - Are you sure? I'm sure. Red! - Come on, red. - Red. - Red! - No. Red. Red. Red. I told you. We should have just quit. Look. Now all the chips are gone. Hey. No one can lose forever. We will eventually win. Black or red? I'm done. Come on. One more round. One more round. Black or red? - Red. - Red? - Red. - What? - Are you nuts? - This is how you do it. We'll get back our loss. - No. - Trust me or we'll be screwed. You can't be that unlucky. No more bets. It's clear now. You are that unlucky. Come on. We're broke. Let's sleep. - What's going on? - I won! Where did you get the chips from? This man gave them to me. He said he kept betting against me and won. So he gave me some. - Really? How much did you get? - Look. Did you bet on zero? Yes. That's 36 times! 36 times! - 3.6 million? - It's 3.6 million! - It's 3.6 million! - It's 3.6 million! It's 3.6 million! - Cheers. - Cheers. What's that? Oh, man. I forgot to exchange one. I'll cash it for you. You can keep it as a souvenir. It's just chump change. Now that I am so rich. - I'll buy a diamond ring with this. - I see. I'll buy a new house with this. I'll buy Nami Island with this. I will buy everything. It's just around 100,000 baht. You can't buy all that. Just let me dream, will you? I've always wanted to spend money like a millionaire. I was wondering how it feels like to be one. Me too. I wondered about it too. Once in a lifetime, right? - Shall we? - Shall we? - Shall we? - Shall we? We shall! I'm rich! I don't understand a thing but it sounds romantic. I think it's so-so. It's not that great. What is it? Did you know that I once became a part of a movie? Really? Just an extra. I stood next to the main actor, though. Which movie? Is it a famous one? Have I seen it? Do you not recognize me? No. You've never seen it, then. Or maybe you just can't remember. Give me a hint. You were just an extra. How can anyone remember? Sure, I was just a supporting role. I wasn't the main actress. Do you want to try being one? Hey. - What? - We're almost there. Okay. We're here. We are here. It's Bae Yong-joon! It's Bae Yong-joon! He's a waiter at the hotel. He looks like him so I hired him. - You're crazy! - Hey. I thought it was really him. Gosh, I wouldn't have the money to hire the real one. They look alike, right? Ta-da! A special menu for the new rising star. Look. Wow. Bae Yong-joon is in the house. Hey, have we met before? Yes, at Hanami Island. Oh, that's right. You're the shady supporting actress from Thailand who followed me all the way here to Korea. You became a lead actress now, huh? Did you use your boobs to get here? My boobs aren't big enough to get me anywhere. I would rather be a supporting actress. It's unbelievable that we both met each other here. I didn't want to meet you that badly. Oh, please. You didn't want to? You peed your pants when you saw me. You like this joke, huh? You're laughing hard. You can't stop laughing. You're speechless, aren't you? Well, I'm just a supporting actress. I have no lines. Come on. Don't be sad. You might be a supporting actress, but you're the cutest one there. What are you doing? Be careful. Don't push me. I'll fall. Help me up. Oh, no. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. No peeking! Nobody wants to look at you! It's so cold. Oh, my god. It's fucking cold. How cold is it? Unimaginably cold! - Are you happy now? - It was freezing. What was that? You wanted to taste it, didn't you? You're no joke. Was it tasty? It was salty. It's so cold. By the way, I changed my flight so we could go back together. Really? That's good. Dead air, huh? We made a deal to speak honestly about everything, right? Yes. Do you like me? Of course. I mean, do you like me as a girlfriend? Well… I'm not sure. Thanks for being honest. I feel good toward you. But I… Min Ah asked me to stay longer so I think I will change my plan to stay with Min Ah. What about me? You can go back to Seoul first. I think I'll be here for a little while. Is there something wrong? No. Why do all girls say that? They say there's nothing going on, but obviously, there is something. Why must we part ways? It's not necessary. We'll have to part ways eventually. Whether it's now or later, what's the difference? I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? What are you mad about? Why can't we travel together like before? "Like before"? Do you want me to keep playing the "I don't know your name" game, just say goodbye at the airport, and pretend like nothing ever happened? Why do you have to be sarcastic? What do you want me to do, then? We've only known each other for a few days. Exactly. So why should you care? We don't even know each other. Can you just drive? No, we must talk it out first. I'll go, then. If you want to be on your own that badly, I'll go. Hey. Hey! Hey, where are you going? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Have you seen the girl who was with me? The girl who came with me, have you seen her? Come with me. The girl who came with me. I got here a while ago. What is wrong with you? How could you leave me like that? I don't know how to drive. If that car didn't pass by, what was I supposed to do? I'm sorry. I'm an asshole. I'm so damn stupid. I'm such a loser. When I said I wasn't sure, I wasn't sure what my feelings for you were. I just know that when I'm with you, I'm so damn happy. When you wanted to part ways, and when you disappeared, I felt horrible. Is this what they call love? How can you love me that easily? We don't even know each other. You don't even know my name. You're right. I don't know you. But I do know this one person. She can drink a liter of Pepsi. When she rides on my motorcycle, she falls asleep every time. And when she gets drunk, she can bend his back. I also know that if I have to be with her, I will probably be jinxed forever. If I gamble, there's no way I will ever win with her. But you know what? I would still love to see her every day. Are you that person? What's wrong? You're crying as if someone died. And you aren't? Can I hug you again? I didn't say you can't. Here. What is it? - I don't know. - What? Just eat it. We have no money left. Here. Among all of our meals together, which one do you like the most? Well… I like the jajangmyeon at Min Ah's house. Can you make it for me when we go back? - Can you? - It might not be edible. What about you? I like this one. Look, I'm holding your hand. You're right. It's heavy. Let's go. Shall we take a picture? We haven't had a picture together. Sure. Let's ask her to take it. Come on. Goi. How did you get here? Well, the address on the postcard. Oh, this is… a Thai person I met here. I see. I'm May. - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were Thai. That's okay. You wanted me to take a picture for you, right? I'll take it. Is over there okay? - Sure. - The house is nice. Hey. Do you want a photo together? - I… - Just me, please. You'll only make me look short. All right. Are you ready? One, two, three. Thank you. My face is chubby. I'll get going now. - Are you leaving? - Yes. It was nice meeting you, Goi. See you. I forgot to take this. How have you been? Well… I've been good. Why did you send me this? I thought you didn't want a marriage. I just… needed some time to think. Your friends told me you're getting married. I can only get married to one person, right? So I have to marry the one that I love. Hey. Can I talk to you? About what? Did I forget to pay for the food? Where's Goi? I'm… I'm sorry. - I didn't think… - Listen. Don't explain anything. I understand. If we happen to meet again, make sure to greet me. Does that mean we won't meet again? Why should we meet again? We are just two people who got dumped, and happened to meet abroad. It was cold and lonely. All the feelings we had are probably not real. How would you know? Aren't you the one who said that cheesy love like the one in movies doesn't exist in real life? I better go. Wait. Can I, at least, know your name? Stop it. Don't you feel sorry for me? That was fast. Did you lose the key? No, it's here somewhere. What's wrong? What's your name? Cherry. - Cherry? - Yes. Cherry. Cherry. SABAI DEE THAI MASSAGE These are the designs that you may select from. Please pick the one that you like. - Let's go. - Okay. The show was so funny. Yeah, right. And you were reluctant when I called. But the glasses guy was cute. - Right? I told you. - I like him. - Meow, what day is it today? - Friday. Why? What story do you have to share with our Club Friday listeners today? Oh, my god. - Are you that addicted to the show? - Yes. - Wow. - Hello. Hello, are you still there? - Hello? - Well… someone once told me that if I have a problem, I can always call here. - She said DJ Aoy and Chod can help. - Not to that extent. All we can do is listen to you. At that time, I told her that it was nonsense. How can a DJ help you? Wow. He's got a lot of nerve. - You're right. - Why did he call them, then? Then, what made you call us today, Darng? I… - What kind of person is named Darng? - Be quiet. What's wrong? Why did you stop? I don't know why I am calling. You two probably can't help me. Then, I think we should let others call in. Wait, hold on. Well… just listen and try not to throw up. Last year, I went to Korea and I met this woman. We traveled together for a few days. I don't even know her name. But I felt that I'm in love with her. Wow, this is like a romantic movie. You met her abroad just for a few days. She told me that our feelings might not be real. Do you feel that way? I don't know. But if they weren't real, they wouldn't have lasted this long. It has been over a year, why do I still think about her? I still want to see her every day. Do you think I should stop being crazy? Why don't you go see her and tell her? That would be difficult. I know nothing about her. I just know that she was once an extra in a movie. There are thousands and thousands of movies. Do you think I'll ever find her? I think what she told me was right. "Cheesy love like the one in movies doesn't exist in real life." Don't you think so? How about this? Do you want to leave your real name here? Just in case we can help you out. All right, if you say so. My name is… I don't know who you are You don't know who I am We don't know each other's real world The most important thing Might not be as important As the day we get to meet, talk And be together Please forget this big world Let us be the only ones you think of Live happily as if it was your last day It was nice not knowing you Just knowing that I love you is enough Just because we don't know each other It doesn't mean We love each other less, right? As long as you're next to me Everything feels right Let your heart float in the air Do what you want to do Just let it be And expect nothing Nothing is considered as wrong If you just take your mind off it You can do Everthing you want for a day Please forget this big world Let us be the only ones you think of Live happily as if it was your last day It was nice not knowing you Just knowing that I love you is enough Just because we don't know each other Doesn't mean We love each other less, right? As long as you're next to me Everything feels right It was nice not knowing you Just knowing that I love you is enough Just because we don't know each other It doesn't mean We love each other less, right? As long as you're next to me Everything feels right It was nice not knowing you Just knowing that I love you is enough Just because we don't know each other It doesn't mean We love each other less, right? As long as you're next to me Everything feels right Subtitle translation by Joey Vajrabukka
