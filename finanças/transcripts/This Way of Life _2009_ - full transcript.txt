gunshots in distance Girl: It sounds like an army, pow. The first one was probably my dad because it went- the first one was quite loud but then Nick went his like, pow, shoot, shoot, shoot, pow shoot, shoot. [gunshot in distance] Girl: My dad. Girl: Here’s some more dad. Boy: You're going to need some more. Man: Fair enough it’s a nice hind . Boy: Oh it’s because he chucked to the feet Oh, yep, we are having a herbal tea boys, come and look at all of this Peter: Which side you shot it? Man: See I told you I hit put it at the base- base of the neck, eh, right there. Girl: Abigail’s boots. Man: What are you talking about? I shot this one. You just went and found them and retrieved them for me this morning. You see, me being the alpha male sent him on his way. Man: No you didn't have to send me on my way, I just knew. Man: Yeah we were going to get in there anyways, thought he was king. Take him over here. Man: Are you redoing this? Man: It looks crispy and all. Man: Have you cooked any medallions yet? Man: No, does it look like it? Just because it’s not the way you do it. Peter: Brass, here to see. Isn't it funny that it ran out of energy right on the skin? Came through bone and meat and then it was the skin that finally stopped it? have a look here, how does it feel? Girl: It’s heavy. Man: Yeah, amazing isn't it. Llelwyn: My name is Llelywn Steven McKardina and my dad’s name, he’s called Peter. And he likes to take me to the mountains with some of the elders. Man: What I do for- for a living is I live for a living. What I do for income is whatever I can without compromising my integrity. If I can combine the two, the living and the income, then that’s good. Man: Watch out Eli, I’ve got a sharp knife. Eli: Okay. Peter: I'm running out of hair, right up these patches of hair missing on my left arm. Peter: My children know how they get their meat. To bring a whole animal home, hang them up, then children see what they are and they participate in the skinning and the cutting up and yeah they- and they love it. Peter: That's really good deer here, well two good ones here and [inaudible], should last a couple of months. There's a hole there, there's a hole in the ribs. Child: What's that from dad? Peter: That’s from the bullet. Child: Cool. Some nice- Dad I like that smell kind of- Man: It’s not a nice smell but it’s a smell that I like because I know that it’s- it means there's good meat coming. Peter: The first time Wellie saw them shoot a deer and he came up to the deer and was kicking it but it was dead. But, you know, he got a bit sad and he- he says to me that it died so we could live, So we could eat it and live, and dead so thats exactly what it's done He treated it with respect and that’s- that’s what I want to see in him. That’s something I’ve tried to instill in him, is the appreciation for the animal giving its life. Child: I’ve got four younger brothers and sisters and my mom’s going to have a new baby soon. And we live in Omah, a little town on the north island of El Tiedo, New Zealand. Peter: If you ask me to describe Llelwyn, you know, physically, he’s just a little skinny kid and he’s small for his age. Well, you know, he’s not a big kid but he’s got a lot of confidence. And he’s clever, he thinks about things, reasons things out. Then he can be a little scared thing as well over things that, you know, are of no consequence. Peter: Slowly, slowly. Peter: But then he’ll lead a big string of horses across rough country, yeah, that’s funny Aurora’s sitting the next one down, she’s a year older than Malachi so she’s the second oldest. She finds pleasure in simple, silly things. And she’s very emotional and she lets her spirit sort of guide how she feels. She’s the best on horseback out of all the kids. Peter: I see your naughty little legs kicking her and up, especially in the- making her gallop, stir her Peter: She just let’s her courage and her confidence with them and her trust in them. And that’s- that’s the big thing with her, yeah. Malachi: Daddy taught me. Peter: Malachi is about Malachi. There's a lot of bravado there but when it comes down to getting to it, he’s- he gets pretty scared when it comes to doing things that are quite tough. But in the other sense, you know, working with me, helping me, He out works his brother and his sister, he’s got the sort of spirit or the sort of personality where he- a lot of things he needs to learn by experience. Peter: The kids always say that Elias is my favorite. It just seems that way because he’s quite an affectionate little boy. When he was young and he got sick and he had to stay in hospital for a week. So Cole had the kids and I stayed in the hospital with him and he really bonded with me in the hospital. And then after he came back he was- he was daddy’s boy and the kids, oh, from then on, Elias is his favorite because Elias gets cuddled all the time. Well Elias cuddles, yeah. Peter: Corbin is about Corbin, yeah. If she’s doing something it’s because it’s what Corbin wants to do, yeah. Corbin: I can. Peter: You can. She’ll do something and she- if she’d thought about it, she’d know fair well the consequences. Peter: Oh no, no, you're not going It's like she’s surprised at it. ‘I was just doing what I wanted to do’ Peter: One more Man: She’s the girl version of Malachi. At the same time, you know, she’s really loving, loves her mummy and daddy. When she realizes she’s hurt us, you know, she’s always doing things like writing little cards, little sorry notes and how much she loves us and like, yeah. Colleen: How do you spell mum? Girl: C- Colleen: No, that’s Colleen but how do you spell mum [inaudible 00:09:45] Girl:M Colleen: M, U Girl: U, M Colleen: Very good. Girl: My mum’s name is Colleen and she’s the bestest mum in the world, there's no better mum than her. Colleen: I have- I have but many people tell me I’m crazy, I have five kids and one on the way. The oldest is 8 and the youngest is turning five, so I have five under five. But it doesn’t bother me that we- we’ve got quite a few children and I’d like to have more, so yeah. Child: this is my grandfather Papa Weedle’s house. He’s my dad’s dad and he grew up in this house. Colleen: It’s been handed down from generation to generation, they've had seven generations now Now of the Tanner family in this home it's quite a rich heritage where they have with this Tanner name and also this house, it’s over 100 years old. Child: Papa Weedle and my dad don't get on any more and Papa Weedle wants to sell the house Colleen: We’re hoping that we’ll be able to get this place and if not- there's so many that- who are quite interested in it for cropping and they’ll probably demolish the house which I think is the most saddest part. There used to be garden bits all up front and that was- (?Sophie Gardener) used to have them there. Why it was so homely is because it has a really good service house. Actually when I first came here virtually all the walls were covered with family photos and very impressive ones. (?They got all dusted over, this is Aunty Betsy eh?) Girl: Yeah and now it’s- now she doesn’t look like that, eh. Colleen: Oh she’s a little bit older, yeah. Colleen: We’ve got the cemetery which a lot of people think is quite spooky just a house away from us. And that’s where all the (?Carner’s) are buried. Actually we were talking to one of- one of the aunty’s the other day and she says they would- they would be so happy to see the children move on and she says she felt it when she comes into the house. Child: All of my relatives, all of the Carners, we had heaps of them, people from the Maori battalion and heaps of family, heaps of people who lived there say for 100 years old. Colleen: (?Been kicked harder on a voice out) of course what we want to do to the house because it’d be so disappointing if we don't get it and, you know. Colleen: Coming? Child: Today’s kind of special because mum and dad are going to buy the house. They're taking my new baby sister, Salem with them. Colleen: Do you mind them going down ahead of the [inaudible 00:13:19] Peter: [inaudible] Right get ahead of them, ah the burgers, grab that little mare. Peter: I’m just anxious to get it over with, I’ve, you know, resigned myself to the fact that we could lose our home but life goes on. We’ll get over this, we’ve lived quite a blessed life. If we lose it, it’s not- it’ll be even more blessed. Child: But someone else had already bought the house so so mum and dad they didn't even get to bid. Colleen: So what does that mean for us? Peter: [inaudible 00:14:28] Colleen: No I don't Colleen: Peter’s dad put his head in and gave a big smile, he’s gone and done something. Peter: Oh well I was hoping it would all be over today one way or the other. No, she’s got no idea. I think she’s got no idea. Peter: This is my home, this is my home, this is my community, this is where I decided i was going to live working on options now such as just living like Gypsies, sell our truck and ride around on horses and just live on the side of the roads. Colleen: Oh, it’s- it’s not where I’d like to be but- we’ve got lots of family but if I move with my family, we’ve got to sell all our horses which is the saddest out of all of it, yeah. Peter: Time to go in for a swim, forget our worries for an hour or so, swim in the river take the kids for a ride. Colleen: It’s getting quite nasty there, we had- on Sunday we had, I would say about 15 people here. Um, the guy who apparently has bought it Him and his family came over and they were just, he swearing at us. And yeah, not that you need 15 people to come and kick a family out. Oh but they actually- um, they came to drop some stuff off, I don't think- it wasn’t a lot of stuff, they were just all hanging outside, yeah, so. I don't know, maybe it was intimidation tactics, I don't know. Well it intimidated me anyway. It’s- it’s not nice for the kids, we don't want the kids exposed to that kind of rubbish so we thought well we’ll just get out of the situation and they can have the place if they want, it’s no biggie. Peter: I don't want to move out, Now I have got big, fat prison wardens coming over my house trying to kick me and my family out and putting themselves and me at risk. He’s a prison warden the guy who- who came round to- and my dad sort of done a deal with him and got him- got him to try and kick us out. Colleen: Well according to Weedle, it is that we abide what- by what he says, you know we- he’s the- he’s the patriarch, we- yeah we go along with what he is saying. He came over the other day, Pete wasn’t here and he put a few- he thinks we need him for some reason, that he’s the only one who can save us but save us from what, I don't know. And we had a few disagreements I was just telling Peter, um, a few years ago, there was no way I would have spoken to, you know, voiced my opinion to someone. And you know, I was arguing with this- with his dad, you know, I was thinking that Pete’s influence had rubbed off on me, I don't know. Pete: I’d rather not fight. I’ve done things in my past and dealt with people in my past and being quite hard in my past and I felt like dishing some of that out onto him. But it would have brought violence into our home, that’s something I don't want my children to have around them. Police officer: One thing is his perception, he’s willing to go away today, let things cool down which is good because we don't want any further aggravation. Girl: Hello. Police officer: Fine. You're still happy to move out which is- which is good for him. Peter: Yeah, we’re going, yeah we’re going. Peter: But I’m not going to be bullied into paying rent to- and that’s extortion. You know, those two big fellas come here, they try and kick down the door, that’s extortion, they tried to drag me out the window, that’s extortion, yeah. Police officer: Yeah. Peter: So, yeah, I ended up saying to them last week that I’ll be out in three weeks. And then he says, oh look I’ve bought the place and I’ve got a mortgage and I said look if you’ve bought the place then I’ll pay you rent. Police officer: Yeah. Peter: And then I find out during the week that he hasn’t bought the place. And as soon as I go out there to them and I said look I’ve talked to people [inaudible 00:20:53] Colleen: Just, they just turned and he put some stuff he picked and I don't now, but Peter just came in and locked the door and they were yelling that’s what I- that’s when I realized it was on and [inaudible 00:21:09] just swearing. Child: [inaudible 00:21:19] Child: Our game was [inaudible 00:21:29] Child: [inaudible 00:21:31] It’s not under his name, it’s still Police officer: [inaudible] under his family, it's still under your farm? Peter: Yeah. and then my dad wet into an agreement with the property, this is going back almost six years and I paid the mortgage and did all that. Police officer: Yeah. Peter: Okay, until my dad broke the lease agreement. Police officer: Where’s your dad through all this? Does he still live- Peter: Oh, he’s in (?Havelock), yeah. Police officer: Okay. And how is it- has he gone round and spoken to those gentlemen and? Peter: Oh, well he- he’s the one who jacked up this guy to bail him out of mortgage. It was up for sale, my dad stopped the sale but he can't- my dad can't transfer land to him, he can't sell the land to him because the special signee still has an interest in the land and has asked for a (?diversion). so this guy has gone and put a hundred grand down the [inaudible] And that’s not my fault, yeah, between him and my dad, my dad does some dodgy deals but, you know, it’s got nothing to do with me. Radio chatter from police radio Peter: can you- can leave those here until they go? I mean- Police officer: Yeah. Police officer: I’ll go out and have a talk to him then. Police officer 2: And I’ll just wait here. Police officer: I’ll emphasize that a decision or, you know, some sort of clarification needs to be made urgently. Peter: Yeah. Police officer: To avoid any further problems. Peter: What happens with that, them grabbing me and trying to drag me out the window? Police officer: I mean if they come back again, just lock the doors, give us a call and we’ll come flying, fast- Peter: But they were coming in, they were going to [inaudible 00:24:06] Police officer: Yeah, well. Peter: I know taking a life isn't worth it), what do you do there? Police officer: Okay. Thanks for your help, I appreciate. Peter: Yeah. Police officer: Yeah, sorry about that. Peter: Yeah. Police officer: Okay then. Child: [inaudible 00:24:25] Child: Did they take one of the guns? Peter: [inaudible 00:24:44] Child: [inaudible 00:24:45] Peter: How were you as kids? Child: [inaudible 00:24:46] Child: No, I wasn’t, I was just starting crying like- Child: I was angry Peter: You were angry, eh? Child: Yeah, I got angry, I just felt like picking up the thing with [inaudible too angry. Child: Lucky we’re going camp tomorrow [inaudible 00:25:07] just get all our stuff ready tomorrow and we’re going to leave, leave this house- place and mess it all up. I don't think we have another opportunity to [inaudible] 00:25:15] Child: Oh! Child: What? Child: Have a look at your hair. I know what we should do, cook some eggs and some steak and then here, like sandwich and then you can give it to them. And they're trying to- they eat the egg [inaudible 00:25:52] because it’s so [inaudible 00:25:55] on your tongue Peter: Is it? Child: Yeah. Peter: Anything in there? Anything salvageable? Man: No, not by the look of it. Colleen: [inaudible 00:26:50] like to worry about Peter, they’ve all got trespass notices, they can't come onto the property. And so it’s, let’s get rid of your shed because that was, you know, so easy to get into the shed and he says, are you sure? And I say, no, no we’ll leave- we’ll leave the house, we’ll get rid of your shed and that was the very last load that we did. So we left all the photos and yeah, stuff, it’s just- I don't know, you can't replace photos Children playing Child: He’s a Frenchman Child: He’s from England Child: Another European, he’s an American. Child: I love the house, me and my brother Llelwyn, and even bring some of our soldiers here. Child: But camping is fun too Colleen: People might think we’re going through a lot of hardships especially with the house burning down and having to live in a- you know a lot of people like are saying, you're living in a caravan, with six children? You know, they- they think I’m superwoman or something. I guess it- it varies on how people can cope, you know. I guess someone who’s lived in a flashy house and had everything given to them, they would find this way too hard to endure but it could be worse, you know. I- I’ve got so much- our house has burnt down, we’ve lost a lot of things but I’ve got my children, they're all alive, they're safe, they're happy. Colleen: All we ever wanted for our kids to be happy, enjoying life and being happy with- with each other. I think a place like this actually brings it out, really. Child: Do you want mum to look at my tooth? Here’s the little one, I pulled it out by myself. Oh, (?Wigley) kicked me in the mouth and my wiggly tooth was- yeah, then it started bending over like that, I just pulled it out. Child: Did it hurt? Child: Nah. Colleen: I’ve never ever feared the kids being on the horses. You know, we’ve always talked to them about safety, you know. so we've never ever worried about safety helmets We would never put our kids on a horse where you’d feel they would be in danger. It’s human nature to like to be thrilled and to have fun and- Child: Mum, I ditched the others just ran off without them, chasing after a rabbit. Colleen: Talk about a few things unless you put fear into them. Colleen: Living out here too, you know, they just go and do their own things, they go have their adventures, life’s fun, life’s I guess to them, good. They love it here, why wouldn’t they though? It’s very beautiful and life’s just fun. That are we, you know, raising them to- to be disappointed when they're older? Because life’s just changing and the world’s changing. I hope my kids grow up to appreciate this- this life, that the world still allows us to have a life like this. We’re just worried that we’re going to raise our kids and life’s going to be not what they expected, it’s going to- you know, it’s going to be full of hardships and- and you know, just not- not this. Whip crackling Child: My dad found us a shed to live in that has lots of paddocks so all our horses can say with us. We thought we might have to move to my nana (?Dorine’s) house, that’s my mum’s mum. Colleen: I’d say (?Lupita) wasn’t keen on coming back to then shed because mum has- mum’s house has got a lot more comforts. But when I came here, it was just, this is home, this is where our (?heart) family function, we function here. You know, we- and even the kids are like, oh, it’s so nice to be home, eh, mum. And I’m like, it is, you know, even though we don't have a- we’ve got to rush up there to the toilet and- and everything, it’s just we function here as a family, we have fun here, we’re together here, we can do without. Colleen: Children know a lot, we think they don't but they know more than- than what they put out. We had to withdraw ourselves so that we could protect the kids and I knew through the things that they were saying that we needed to do that just so they could not be influenced by our feelings, you know, just because things are going bad between Pete’s family, our children dont need to be affected by them Colleen: Weedle fell in love with Peter’s mother and when you fall in love with a person, you fall in love with everything about them, whether it’s children she’s had with someone else. And they were young children, Peter was probably 9 and how could you not love a little 9 year old. How could you begrudge them that they had a different father? Colleen: the situation with our family and the house is- it’s not a good one. I’ve never had to deal with these kind of issues in my family. I was always taught, we’d talk about things and we solve problems. Whereas Peter grew up where your opinion didn't matter, it was mum and dad were right. Colleen: At the moment we can't resolve the problem, we’ve had to protect ourselves because it was causing a lot of hurt. Peter: Salem’s a baby, her personality is growing all the time. She’s the only one that as a little baby who really liked me and wanted me, you know. and I loved it because it was- you know, it was in a time in my life when I was having quite a few trials and when there was this dark cloud over me, there was that little bright thing there. So she- she saved my soul. It’s funny, you're a little, little babe who’s there when you need it. And I don't know how people can say there's not a God because someone made it happen that way, you know, that I have a child and everything’s that happened in my life and at the same time, there's always a ray, a hope or something that's- thats bright So she came at a good time. But they all have, they’ve all come at good times, they’ve all come at the right time my wife came into my life at the right time. Peter: They say that I married above myself and I feel I did. I feel that the rest of my life I have to work at being worthy to have my wife. Peter: Malachi, you want your sister to fall? Malachi: No. Peter: Well obviously you do. Child: My mum’s having another baby [inaudible 00:37:18] want it to be a girl. But me and Elias are hoping it’s a boy because you get to do all the work down at the yard and help dad and stuff like that. Colleen: About I’m having another baby, um, a little bit more, um not so keen I think. I’m not so keen on this- on having this child and maybe having more because we’re in a situation where, well look we live in a shed. Home is my kids, my husband, not about the flesh building, it’s just where you find- where you're loved. And, so yeah, I couldn’t say I’m homeless no way. Financially we’re not in a situation to have, um, (?team) but who knows, maybe down the track we probably could have more, you know, it will be a bit nice. Child: My dad’s got all the horses out there, he’s going to start a business. I reckon they’ll like it here. Peter: It’s funny, you know, the- this- the society which is based on capitalism has actually systematically taken from people this- this idea of- of having a right or a God given right to- to dwell on the land and to- and to be on land. You know, they- they’ve systematically done it. So, you know, the whole society is based on this idea of land ownership, our whole society is based on that and that is- that is the truest wealth of owning the actual land Because then anyone else who wants to- Wants to actually dwell or live on the land is subject to the person who says I own it, You know, and they're at the whim of them. But all land belongs to the crown. And anybody who buys a piece of land in this country buys a freehold title from the crown that they can hand on to their children. And they believe- you know they're under this misconception that they actually own the land. But any time the crown wanted to take the land or to- to use the land they have the power to do so because they say they own it. Just to live the way I want to live, I have to buy into this whole aspect of- of money and earning money, yeah. the other option is that I- I could just become a gypsy and live on the road with my horses but that gives us no security. So I’ve gotten to this- to the point where I- I’m going to have earn enough money to buy land and say that I own the land and now I can stay on it and I can have my horses on my land. It’s a conundrum. Peter: It’s not in very deep is it? This is where you went wrong Coco, you should come in from the top. It’s only a baby. Got you. It’s so scared. No, no, no. better than down the pants. the kids will love you. Peter: So he’s yielding to my pressure because I have him here on the slippery ground first. Good boy. We’ve got similar hair, me and him. He’s feeling good. you’ve got to be firm on him though. I don't mean firm as in hard. I mean, you know, he just stepped in and I didn't tell him to step so I put him back pretty much basically where he was. And it’s- you know, it’s discipline, it’s- it’s yielding to my- my control or my authority, as man should be to God. You know, he got a soft knock on the nose to tell him to stand up and he fought that, So then he got a heavier knock on the nose. And it got heavier and heavier with the rope, you know, I used the rope to knock him on then nose with the rope holder. and it got heavier that he learnt that the soft one means the same thing as the heavier one, you know. so why not just yield to the soft one? So I guess in a way they are broken, they do yield t it or they submit to it. I don't think without it you can- you can work on the partnership. It’s like me and Colleen, we’ve got a partnership going with the family but I’m still the master. Colleen: Is that right? Colleen: Yeah, you're funny, alright. Peter: There's a saying that there's nothing better for the inside a man than the outside of a horse and that’s based on just the sight of a horse. A beautiful horse is a- is a compelling thing to- to stir the inside of- of one’s soul. It goes a bit deeper than that for me, it’s- it’s the inside of a horse. It’s ithat spurt inside them and that- that soul inside them that it reflects myself, it reflects the inner person. A horse to me represents- and working a horse represents this same way I can craft myself and form myself because you're really, you know you're here on earth to form yourself into something worth being proud of. A horse represents practicing of that. Peter: I can take a horse that’s a clean animal and has base instincts and natural instincts and I can change those instincts to be of service to me but also to go against what- what natural instincts it has. Because a horse that lets me hop on its back and ride it and goes off a cliff for me or into a river for me or does all these things that I get them to do is actually going against all its natural instincts. Peter: If I look at it sometimes, I look at it and think I am a slave master, basically I am. I get these animas to do what I want and in return they get fed well, they get cared for, they get loved. And it’s a fragile relationship but you find yourself coming to a relationship with the horse where it gets close to equal. But I don't know if it ever does get equal because it’s still my will being performed but it gets close to equal and you love the animal. You know, I’ve got a few horses that I love dearly, it takes a lot to get that relationship Child: Those places [inaudible 00:46:14] is is, it belongs to our tribe. (?dad) keeps most of his horses up in the mountains. He’s been bringing them for a long time. Some of them are still wild. Peter: To come up hunting and check on them and see the new foals in the spring and to watch them grow and sometimes I come up here and it’s, you know we might have had a hard winter or some heavy snows or something and you lose some. You might see an old mare that you might find her dead somewhere and, you know it can be a little bit sad sometimes. And just watch them left to be horses. Yeah, just to let them- let them breed and grow up and cage them and handle them and take them out, yeah. Sell them, now [inaudible 00:47:24] for business with the horse trading on the beach we’ll need most of them. ooh [inaudible 00:47:29] Peter: Well as it rains, just drizzling like that and it’s not blowing then it’s good for hunting. Keeps the animals calm. Peter: You see an animal, a living being and you're going to continue your life – or sustain your life by taking the life of that other living thing. I’m taking everything from this animal, I’m taking it’s life, it’s not a quick guiltless process, I want to take all care to kill this animal in one shot. I think there's a responsibility or an onus on me to do that because of what the animal is giving me. This is the difference between hunting to kill something and hunting to sustain yourself. Peter: And it’s more about being true to your morals or your- your integrity, that just to respect that God missioned that everything that lives is holy You know, having that in your life helps you to make decisions based on a conscience rather than rules. Peter: Don't get me wrong though, I love the hunt because it- it does something in me, it makes me feel- it makes me feel pure to go up there and to- and to- to work. You know it’s- you know I could spend a day at the (?freezing works) killing cattle and working and not working really hard, not working myself into a sweat and earn enough that day to maybe buy half a side of venison or half a deer, you know. And there's no satisfaction in that. You’ve got to work hard and not be sweating. You know I might shoot a deer down in some gully and I’ve got to carry it up and there’ll be times when I’ll just be sitting there thinking, I don't know if I can go any further with this thing on my back. Peter: I’m going to get you to clean the rifle up and the scope is clear and (?Nick) shot this one, it was Nick, eh. A nice little pig, nice little pork. Peter: It’s a lot more work but it makes me feel good and it makes me feel healthy. he's healthy, got a little bit of fat in him I need a shower- hang him up and have a shower. 00:50:34 Peter: I’m not worried about being a great hunter and mounting heads and putting them up on my wall and all that sort of thing because that’s not why I do it. I put meat on the table and that’s what I want, I don't want to be known as the great hunter, but it makes me feel great to provide food. Peter: I’ve got great memories of my childhood, of when I was young coming up in to the mountains here with my dad. Peter: Great memories of me and my wife before we were even courting, we were good friends and we used to come up here and spend long periods up here. We’d just come up here and bring food and stay till the rood ran out or you know, Colleen would say that she felt like a fizzy drink or a rush monroe ice-cream so we’d pack up and run out all of a sudden after spending a few weeks in here. Child: Dad found us a new house on the edge of town. We had to change schools again but our new school is cool and we learn Maori, English and Spanish. Colleen: It’s really nice to have a home that’s spacious Child: This is the spare room that we kept locked in. Child: That’s [inaudible 00:52:19] room, you know you lock on it. Colleen: But with more room we tend to want more space, the children tend to go to their rooms and play with their things and we’re kind of divided. Whereas in our little shed we were all in one room, we were more content to be with one another. I liked it better, I thought there was more happiness in the smaller home than I do in a bigger one. Malachi: And in my room you can get out of the window and into the roof and over into mum’s bedroom. Peter: [inaudible 00:52:52] a couple of months for two families anyways, at least a couple of months. Peter: yeah most of it’s ready to- ready to be cut up and bagged in the freezer. I think 100 years ago we’d have smoked most of it and made sausages and things instead of chucking it in the freezer. Man: That’s good tasting meat. Peter: What's wrong mama? Colleen: She wants some meat Peter. Peter: Steak and bread. Colleen: you know, me and Pete talk together about our parenting all the time and you know, how we can improve. And often I pray about it, about- about things. Actually quite often I do, you know, things that bother me or I feel like I’m not doing right, I’ll pray about it. As parents all we teach them is right and wrong and they learn from their brothers and sisters. Call them right out [inaudible 00:55:04] or they're teachings Salem things and she makes choices and she sees things and watches things and they advise her and then she starts learning because children want to learn, they do. Colleen: I knew something was wrong and I had my midwife come over and she just checked me over and said it didn't look good, she said it looked like baby had died and the kids just burst out crying which was, yeah, hmmm, pretty sad. Hmmm, we just sat there for a while crying. Peter: I stayed away from it, I came and had a quick look and then- and since I’ve stayed away from it because it gets a- it gets a fury up in me. Some photos, unburned. Oh man, that’ll teach me for not looking in here when it first burnt down, for staying away, I was sulking about it. Oh we thought we’d lost all of these. Yeah someone- someone has dug them out somewhere and scattered them. Oh men, Colleen is going to be so happy. With my first born. Here’s me with my son and my mother. Me at 16 years old. There was photos of- of my dad, photos of my brothers, photos of all of our family. We’d sit down in that lounge room there with all the children just with a big box of photos just pulling photos out and the kids would look at them, what was this horse’s name? What was this dog’s name? Is that dad? Is that mum? Who’s that? Is that Uncle Kerry? Is that Papa? we’d spend a whole night doing that, that’s something special we’d do now and again. Peter: My dad’s put a trespass order against me apparently. He did it when I was living here. How can you give the tenant a trespass notice? He did it because he was angry, he acts out of anger a lot. Colleen: To be honest I don't know why he really, really does hate Pete. His number one goal now is he wants to destroy Peter. To the point he’s even telling people of recent that the horse raking business is his, that all the horses are his and that Peter owes him big time. And it’s like we’ve- we’ve totally withdrawn ourselves so that he has nothing to do with us but he’s going out there to- to do it. Peter: Our bed was here and I- I liked it here because it was familiar. You know, I see that view out the window there, I remember laying on my bed and that view out the window in the mornings. I remember the fireplace going, me and Colleen having the fireplace going in winter in our bedroom. I just took it for granted, I thought- I thought that I’d always have it. You know, we were going to re pile it and do it all up and honor it, honor the house. Peter: Cole, come have a look at what I found. Colleen: Alright. Child: What is that dad? Peter: Come here you. Colleen: Those are all of our negatives. This is when I was a baby, this was [inaudible 00:59:55] album. Colleen: Oh brilliant. Peter: Walked in the house and I see this photo here sitting on the ground. See I found the pages of this. Colleen: How come no one noticed those before? Peter: I don't know. Maybe because I was sulking and didn't go through everything. I didn't pull open the boxes like people have been doing. Look at these and the photos are- Peter: Keep going down the trees son 01:01:48] Child: Okay Peter: Come on son. Child: [inaudible 01:02:48] Peter: Just slowly take a couple of steps forward. Peter: Oh, it’s the- the bloody bitch that’s been pulling back, she pulled back and pulled one of them off the cliff. We lost one and so she was hanging, this one was one was holding her by her tail, the other one was holding her by her head off the edge of the cliff. So I had to cut her out and she fell off the edge and rolled down. Peter: Is that blood coming off her chest? Man: Yeah, she’s got blood here and blood on the- on the hock (?and on the nipple). Peter: Come on get up there, up you go. Peter: I shouldn’t have let them out, I should have left them. Peter: She went for a haul, she went tumbling over, easily- easily busted her leg or something. Man: Look at her neck here [inaudible 01:06:04] Peter: The hole in her chest that is worrying, probably a bit of bruising, a branch or something. Child: Look at the hole in her chest. Peter: Yeah, I know, she’s got it bad man. It’s a horrible feeling, having a horse hanging over a cliff and having to cut her off to drop. She went over a couple of times as she was rolling. Man: It ain’t coming apart. Peter: It ain’t coming apart. Hello Bubba. Child: That night when we got to the hut, all our dad’s wild horses were missing. Man: Seen any horses yet? Peter: Sorry? Man: Seen any horses yet? Peter: No. Peter: 30 horses disappeared into thin air. I’ve resolved myself to the fact that they're gone, they were stolen. I don't know if there's another name for it, you take someone else’s horses, they're stolen. You come in here and take them away somewhere as your property, that’s theft. We’ll go have a look, there might be something here. Child: Should I say, dad how do you sharpen knives? Can you tell me enough that I just keep it [inaudible 01:08:05]. Got enough, almost cutting my finger. All done. I got heaps, just a little bit to here and now my good hair is gone. Peter: Oh man [inaudible 01:08:49] than that. Peter: Well he picks up on everything I do and if- I’ve got to really, really check myself For a long time, you know, I saw all these good things in him that I- that were the good things in me that I liked and now he’s starting to pick up some of the bad things in me that I don't like. Peter: What did you do to your finger? Child: [inaudible 01:09:12] it’s okay now though. Peter: It’s a papercut. Child: I know but it stings. Peter: Of course I’d like him to live by my rules that I think are right but you know he may see things a bit different than I see them. So I’m hoping that he- you know, fortified in his own conscience that he- he will use it to dictate the decisions he makes in his life. Peter: Can you see how easy it is to keep quiet when you're walking like that? You don't smack it down. Peter: Funny, when I was young I got into trouble when- my old man was a diary keeper and he’d keep things in the diary. And I remember like getting in trouble over something and he’d pull a diary out and start going through a list of things that I’d done wrong, yeah. Even now he’ll bring up things, you know, I did 20 odd years ago. You know when I was a kid I used to sit there and he’d be talking to someone and he’d tell a story about some magnificent shot that he pulled off when he was out deer stalking. And I remember he used to say to me, hey Peter, you remember that? And I’d be there and I’d be like- I’d be like, no that was John who said- who did that. you know, it was someone else’s story. And then he’d go [inaudible 01:10:55] and he’d- he’d told us earlier that that was that- that was the- the sign for if we were saying the wrong thing but you know, this is at home. He pulls us aside and he says if you hear me say this, that means, you need to shut your mouth because you're saying the wrong things and you're going to get it when you get home. Okay, that was the sign. And so we’d be in a conversation like that, you know, and he’d be talking to someone and I’d say the wrong thing, like no, no John pulled off that shot or Paul or- or Dave or someone, yeah. well, Dave did that. And this is a 10/12 year old kid and he’d bust out saying [inaudible 01:11:32]. And people would be like, what the hell! And then he’d just go back to normal, like telling the story, yeah. and I’d be thinking, oh shit, I’m in trouble when I get home, I’ve said the wrong thing or done the wrong thing. Yeah I saw that all the time, it’s just- but at the same time he could be- there’s a horse At the same time he could be quite a neat, sort of interesting person. No son, be careful, come down here and sit down. We’ll go down around [inaudible 01:12:08] I believe she’s down there it might be more. Child: Where? Peter: Down there see where that [inaudible 01:12:12] she’s a bay, no chestnut. Peter: Should be another 30/35 horses or something with those ones. And then the foals that I hadn’t seen this year, the place is empty. And the, what's the lesson to be learned? You know, what is the lesson? To be meek? Is that my lesson? Because I have been up till now. I’ve had a lot of things done to me and wanted to lash out and I haven't done it. If someone burns down my house, threatens my family, steals my horses. Yeah I think I’ve been pretty passive about it and maybe they- they take advantage of that, maybe they- they take advantage of my good nature. Or is that the lesson, that maybe I should fight? Maybe hey, you fight for what- what- what's right and you, you know, stand up for what you believe in. I’ve done it in a passive way up till now. Child: That’s why you’ll [inaudible 01:14:21] a lot of things will harden you. Peter: They’ll harden me. Child: They’ll be pissed off. Peter: See, he knows I’m being meek about it, he knows that I could be hard. Yeah. Peter: There's no taking things back because your words can't be taken back, the same with your children, you can't- you can't take back how you treated them. And I think that’s a huge price to pay for people who- who don't get things right in this life and don't treat their children right or their spouses right or their fellow men right or themselves right. Raising children, if you treat them in fairness. I treat my children how I would like to have been raised now that I have hindsight to look back on it. Child: [inaudible 01:15:45] for me, for a dollar. Peter: Who did your hair? Child: Every Sunday we put on our nice clothes and go to church. Peter: Tuck your shirt in son. Child: Papa Weedle and Nana Patsy go to the same church too. Peter: Here we go, one, two, three, four, five, six. Colleen: the kids love their grandparents. They haven't been able to love them as much as- and to grow with them as much as they should, not like they have with my mum because of the situation that we’re in but I think my kid are neat. You know, there's been times where their nana’s will pass , I saw my son Malachi grab her hand and say, hi nana. That’s neat, they reach out to them. Papa Weedle: Turn it off or turn it away. Hey I asked you to do something, turn it off or turn it away. I know who you are and I know what you’ve been doing. What do you think we’ve been doing? Filming the clown that used to live in there Is that your son? He’s not my son, that’s my wife’s son, alright? There's a difference. I have a step daughter, I don't treat her any different to my other children and I never would. Man: That’s right, I don't either but there's something for someone else to learn a lesson, alright? Just sorry about that, okay? No. I find it very distasteful but it’s all right. of course it is, very, very distasteful. When a son sets about to assert power- now I know that thing is still going because he thinks I’m a clown. No I don't think you're a clown and he works for me so it’s not is responsibility, it’s mine. He’s lucky he’s still standing. No, he’s on public land and he works for me. hey, let me tell you something, doesn’t matter where you stand, where offences of crime are committed, understand that, alright? You ever heard of the doctrine or the scripture, honor thy father and thy mother? Certainly I have. And that’s the underpinning principle of which I talk about this. Right. When you understand that and comprehend that, it is worthwhile telling your story. Did you burn it down? Pardon? Did you burn it down? No I didn't. I have a feeling in my heart who burnt it down but one day someone will have to make them account of that, one day. Definitely wasn’t me. Peter: My brothers and sisters all used to carve their names in this house. This I Eva and [inaudible 01:20:05] who would that be? There's [inaudible 01:20:11], Aron Carana for Lyn Hawkins, Lyn Hawkins was Daryl Hawkins brother. MM would be Michelle [inaudible 01:20:19], Lynn Hawkins, Michael Carana, Eva Carana, Aron plus Lynn, there’s been a lot of people live here. My dad’s parents, their parents and their parents before them. Just greed and money and pride that led to this. Call them, stars and moon and things. I mean what- what do I do? I didn't agree with my dad on some things, yeah. it didn't have to be that way. Child: Our house that burned down was really special. It was warm, it was loving and we had lots of fun there. Peter: There's an old adage, when we say to our children, would you like it if someone did that to you? No. Then do you think it is fair that you do it to them? No. You know, that's always the answer, yeah. Except when maybe Malachi, sometimes, yes. Why is it fair? I grew up with this- with this thing on us, that we had to- we owed our parents. And my dad still says that, we owe him. We- we owe him some great debt because of how he brought us up and what he did for us, yeah. and- it’s early days yet, my oldest is in his 11th year but I don't see him owing me anything if anything I owe him, I owe all my children. And- and then some.
