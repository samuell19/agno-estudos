MASATO SHIMATSUO MAI HOSHO I am... Tomie. TOMIE REPLAY Strange things happen here. The people are getting fewer and fewer. FUMIHITO SATO There is no one else left in this room. They all went home over the past few days. Right after I came into the hospital... Four nurses quit all at once. They say that they all went mad. Really? After that, the director of this hospital went missing. Is it called being spirited away? You talk like a old man. There is something in this hospital. What is "something"? Ms. Taniguchi... Ms. Taniguchi! Your room is next door. DIRECTOR: FUJIRO MITSUISHI That nurse was cute. Shall I talk to her for you? No, thanks. You always take the good ones. When did I do that? You did it three times when we were in high school. - You still remember that? - And also at the last party... You said you couldn't go, so that's why I went. I know, but... Takeshi, what did the fortune say at the ramen restaurant? "If you step forward, there will be a road." That's right. The owner said good things. The ramen was bad, though. What's wrong? Are you okay? I can't drink beer yet. I am going to the bathroom. I got to go again... Fumihito? Are you messing with me? I... got lost. Please get me out of here. What? Is something funny? No. Are you cold? Why were you at the hospital? I... was born at that hospital. Oh, really? Two men and... four women... were trembling with such fear. Dry yourself. And clothes. I will make coffee. Your hand... Have you... killed people? What? How does it feel to kill people? What are you talking about? What do you think when you kill? I don't know. But you are going to kill me, aren't you? How will you kill me? What will you do after you kill me? Underground, it's dark and... there are lots of nasty bugs... I hate it. Lots of bugs... Don't kill me. Kenzo Morita... Here it is. The runaway is Kenzo Morita. 49 years old. He is the director of a hospital. That's right. Any news on my father? Didn't you receive our call? No. I didn't receive anything. I don't know if my mother did or not. What? It seems as though your mother reported it. My mother doesn't live with us. I see. Unfortunately, we can't find your father yet. Okay. If we find something, we will contact you. But even if we find him, we will respect his wishes. We can't force him to come home. It doesn't seem like... he was involved in an accident. It sounds like there are lots of problems at home. I think you should solve these problems first. Excuse me. My name is Morita. Miss Morita? The director's... May I see Miss Kinoshita? Do you have an appointment? No... Would you wait here for a second? Excuse me. How long do I have to wait here? As I told you before... the director is not here now. When can I see him? I've come here every day for a few days now. As I told you... Can I see somebody else, then? Sorry for keeping you waiting. No... I'm sorry I came here without any notice. I haven't seen you for a long time. When I was new here... Yumi used to come to see the director all the time. Were you in elementary school? We used to play here. Don't pretend that you don't know anything. Miss Atsuko... I know you were having an affair with my father. I think you know something about my father's disappearance. Aren't you the reason for that? - No. You are wrong! - What is wrong? Miss Atsuko, you don't seem worried about it at all. I'm worried about him, too! To tell you the truth, I was having an affair with the director. But I don't know anything about his disappearance. Even just before I last saw him... it didn't seem like anything was wrong with him. When I heard you came to see me... I thought I needed to talk to you. But I didn't know how to start talking to you. I'm sorry. I am a straightforward person, so I will tell you. The director and I broke up already. But I still love him. I'm really worried about him. Unfortunately, I'm the only one left, who was at your daughter's surgery. Everybody else quit the hospital. But where is the director? Your daughter's symptoms were very uncommon. That's all. "That's all"? But Sayuri... Your daughter is alive. The operation went well. You don't have to worry about anything. Nothing... is wrong. Right? Miss Sayuri? Dr. Tachibana... Yumi... It's nice to see you here. Could you return this to your father for me? I don't need... MORITA HOSPITAL Yes. I will recheck that when the inspection starts in two days. I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry about that. It's all right. I can stay with you tonight. But you look tired, Mom. Do you think so? You seem very busy. The company is doing well. But everybody is depending on me as a medical consultant. That's hard. There are many complaints from the hospital. The telephone at the company never stopped ringing today. Your father was taking care of the hospital all by himself. They can't do anything without him. So you are very busy. I wish our hospital would close or something. We have to go through this. We don't know when your father will be back. Hey, Yumi. Are you really okay? When are you going on the business trip? In two days. I won't be around here for a while... I'll be fine. ' Bye. Takeshi? Yes. Takeshi? Yes. Why did you answer so politely? I was worried. Why did you go home without telling me anything? Is somebody there? Don't tell anyone. I rescued her from the hospital. Rescued her? I won't forgive you if you tell anyone. What are you talking about? Tomie is mine. Tomie? Who is she? I know you are always trying to steal my fun. Takeshi, is something wrong with you? You always steal everything from me with that innocent act I I wish you'd disappear before my eyes. Takeshi? Takeshi? When did I become yours? Who was that? Who were you talking to? That was my friend. I want to see him. - Tomie... - Don't touch me. I am tired of you. No! No! What? Are you already broken? Broken? I see. You are broken. You are worthless. Why don't you disappear? Call him now. I can't answer the phone now. Please leave a message. Dad's note? "September 24. "Removed it from the patient. "It's a peculiar case. Might be a malignant thing. "Watch the progress. Tomie." During the operation, I cut my left thumb. It might be infected. September 25. I feel pain in my left thumb. I have a fever and chills. Body temperature is 38 C. I feel fatigued. I had 5 milligrams of Morphine. The head we removed started to develop body parts. The swelling of the left thumb metastasized to the arm. Face mark. I can't move my body. I have an auditory hallucination. Tachibana watches the progress. I can't help. I can't move my body. SEPTEMBER 27 MY LEFT ARM IS NOT MINE... GO MAD TOMIE I AM NOT MYSELF ANYMORE. - KILL HER - MONSTER Good morning. When did you get in? I was worried about you. Go and wash your face. Hello? May I talk to you for a second? Yesterday, Yumi came to see you, didn't she? Yes. Was it about his disappearance? Or... was it about you and Morita? We talked about that, too. How did she handle that? I think I puzzled her. May I talk to her again sometime? I don't want it to end like that. I want to tell her all my feelings and... It's a good idea. Please talk to her. But don't hurt her feelings. Yes. She worries about me and doesn't tell me anything. I am a failure as a mother. It was not your fault... that I left home. It might sound strange... but to quit my career to be just a housewife... was very hard for me. I thought I knew him, but... Takeshi? Yumi! Yumi, you seem sad these days. - I'm fine. - We're gonna go out... Yumi never comes with us. Right? Yeah... Okay. I will come. Really? That's unusual. Okay. Let's go. Yumi, what's wrong? I'm just resting. I'm sorry I brought you here. It's not your element. I'm sorry, too. Tomie! - Tomie? - I don't know her. - What? - I don't know her! - Do you know her? - No. It is true that the director is missing. Tell me... Has everybody heard the rumor? No. I didn't have anything to do while I was in hospital. Did you find out something about her? There is one thing... that I'm concerned about. Sorry. Yeah? Sorry. I will call you later. Shut up. Okay. ' Bye. The guys at the club. What? It reminds me that... whenever I am walking with my father, his pager rings. An emergency patient comes in... He says "Yumi, I have to work. Can you go home by yourself?" I got used to my father leaving me like that. My memories of my father are that he's never around. - Ouch... - What's wrong? I'm all right. Mr. Fumihito, is it true you were discharged from the hospital? Don't say "Mr." Just call me Fumihito. Look... I want to show you something. Takeshi was saying this name, Tomie. Your father left the name on his note... "September 24. Removed it from the patient." Can it be that "the patient" is Tomie? "Face mark." "Face mark"? Can you check if there is a patient named Tomie? I will ask somebody. There is more on the last page... What's this? "Tachibana is trapped. "That is such a shame. She read his mind, which knows the medical history of the world. Tomie won't permit us even to pick up anything. Beautiful girl. She is quiet now. She will leave here someday. Tachibana and I shot 15 mg of Morphine... to relieve the pain, but we don't have time now. Tachibana is going. He was staring at the wall, banging his head for five minutes. It's very violent, but she trapped us very well. Tachibana's head and my body are under the Tomie's control. She trapped my left hand. If it awakens, that is the end. Her trap was complete. When the trapped left hand awakens, I am not myself anymore. "Kill her, kill her, kill her." I've been saying that for two hours. Who will I kill? Somebody will tell me little by little. She is quite still. But I feel the danger. There is nothing wrong now. I have to get rid of her before she traps my head. Monster, monster, monster, monster... I will go to visit Takeshi again tomorrow. Can I go with you tomorrow? I want to make it clear about my father. So... Aren't you scared? I am scared. Everybody involved with Tomie... Everybody, even Takeshi changed. He's never said anything like that before. He has become a different person. Your father, too... That's why I want to see her. I will see her and... I don't know about my father much. Ever since I was small. I didn't see him much. If I don't see him now... The important thing will never be made known. Right? I understand. I thought I knew Takeshi very well... but the truth is, maybe I didn't know him at all. "If you step forward, there will be a road." What? When we were in high school, we used to go to the ramen restaurant. The owner wrote those words on the paper. Takeshi really liked those words. He said he wanted to learn the owner's philosophy on life. Let's go to his place tomorrow. Aren't you really afraid? Look. Takeshi... What happened? Monster... - Monster... - Takeshi, what happened? Monster... - Monster... - Takeshi, it's me! Fumihito! "Monster..." - Monster... - Takeshi! - Monster... - Calm down! - "Tomie..." - Look at me! Takeshi! Calm down! Takeshi! I was asked to take care of Takeshi's things. I will deliver them to his parents. I will drive you to your place. Will you continue? How about you? He... is wearing the restricted uniform at the hospital. If he is all right, I will get some information. Can we meet again? I will wait for you. Please be careful. Dad? Dad, is that you? Don't come in! Who... do you think... I am? What a... perfect trap... That blood... That monster's blood... is controlling my body! Stop it! I won. There are so many bugs. I hate them. Please get rid of the bugs. Bugs... She doesn't have any motive. She just hunts during her trips. She reproduces, reproduces, reproduces... Kill her, kill her, kill her... Dad, please stop! "Dad, please stop!" There are so many bugs. I hate bugs... My head is itchy... Do you know what she called me? Monster! I don't like dirty girls like you. I will kill her, too. Kill her, kill her, kill her... Kill her, kill her, kill her... Dad, stop it! Yumi. Dad? Yumi. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I know it's late. Can I talk to you now? Yes. I checked up on something. There is no record for a patient named Tomie. The patient who, on September 24, was operated on was... an emergency patient on that night. Her name was Sayuri Nishimura. Six years old. Your father did the operation. And Dr. Tachibana, who passed away. The nurses were... They are not here anymore. Do you know what that means? Yumi, are you all right? My father... My father... What happened to the director? Please tell me the address of the girl who was operated on. Yumi, you shouldn't do anything. It's not normal. Now that the director is gone, if something happens to you... Listen... I... I always thought of you as my little sister. It's true. I realized that after I fell in love the director. - Me too... - What? Miss Atsuko... I thought of you as my sister. That's why... it was hard for me. Please tell me the girl's address. I have to see Tomie, no matter what. Hello! One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... eleven... twelve... My daughter had an organ transplant. She had a bad kidney when she was born. We found a donor soon, and the operation went well. The other night she started to have horrible pains. And she was taken to your hospital. What happened? I researched it myself. I found the name of the donor. Tomie Kawakami. But there are no records. My daughter... started to say deliriously that she is Tomie. That appears to be her body, too. You saw that too, didn't you? I heard it from an ex-policeman. The important witness from the unsolved case was... had her name recorded as Tomie Kawakami. The case occurred at the end of Meiji era. In the end, the case became wrapped in mystery. The police sealed the name. Even the police can't confirm the existence of Tomie. But since then, Tomie Kawakami... keeps appearing in the history of the crimes. Every case remains unsolved. The policeman said that to me. "Your daughter was unfortunate. You have to give up. Forget about everything." You too. You were unfortunate. I have to burn them... Burn them... Burn them... What happened? He said we were unfortunate, and we should give up. I saw Takeshi. He wanted to see Tomie terribly. He was hitting his head on the wall of the cell. He said he can't forget Tomie. "We were unfortunate?" I don't want that. I don't want that. Let's stop doing this. I will give up. I will forget everything. So... She suddenly appeared right in front of my car. What? I hit the brake at once. There she was. No... That's not true... Soon, my head will be like... I don't want that. Go faster! FOR INTERNAL REASONS, THE HOSPITAL IS CLOSED. Please ask for details inside. Thank you very much. This hospital was started by the director's grandfather. It was a small hospital at that time. But it was expanded and restored. Now it has a complicated design. In the basement, we also have a linen room. This room is the electric room, and it's the heart of this hospital. We usually can't come down here. Director? Are you here? Director? Your father went into the tank of alkaline solution by himself and died. We found a videotape at the scene. This is the tape. It seems fake. It continues on like this. I didn't know you were here. One of the guests asked me... to give it to you; she said it's important. I am very sorry for your loss. I think Fumihito also worries about you so much. I want you to comfort him. I will wait for you at the hospital. Tomie. FUMIHITO SATO Fumihito? Fumihito? Answer me if you are there. "Fumihito? Answer me if you are there." Where is Fumihito? "Where is Fumihito?" What the hell are you? "What the hell are you?" Don't play around with me! How dare you. Why did you come here? You are fools. You love each other, you trust each other... and you betray each other... He pushed you down the stairs. Do you trust that kind of guy? Fumihito, where are you?! Answer me! "Fumihito, where are you? Answer me!" Your father was no different. He had an affair with a nurse. You were abandoned. Aren't you glad he is dead? I... was born here. Your father was... watching me with the dirty eyes. In this musty room... It was the first time someone treated me like this. Yumi... Why did you come here? Don't you know yet? You came here to be killed by him. Yumi... I... You guys are strange. Don't think this is over. You are worthless. Stop it! Don't do it... Do you forgive him just like that? Everybody breaks so easily. They are silly. You are not broken yet. You are all alone. I am alone. I'm alone all the time. Everybody betrays me. Maybe you and I can be good friends. See, you and I are the same. Your corrupted Father... and the man who pushed you down the stairs... They are not worth trusting. Get away from this world... and come with me... forever. Monster! Monster? Yes. Yes, you are! Monster... Did you... call me... a monster? Don't you trust me yet? I trust my father. I trust my mother. I trust my friends. I trust Atsuko. I trust Fumihito. I trust... everything! But I don't trust you! You don't know me. Don't you want to know? Everyone who looks at me... falls in love with me... and says they love me. Then they get jealous. And they start to break. They kill me... and cut me into pieces. And they kill me again. But I won't die. So they kill me again. They kill me again and again. They kill me... they kill me... they kill me... I will show you the girl... who can't die. Kill me. Then you die, I won't forgive you...
