FALCON DIDN'T LIKE HIM Stop! Stop! Get up! - Don't shoot! Stop! Stop! Get up! Get up! Wait... - Get up, you bastard! Wait. In the name of god, please don't. I'll pay you. Get that away! You think you can buy me off? Get up! What is my crime? You're alive, you god damn beggar! Leave me alone. - Take him away! If you're human... Take him away! This is no way to treat a human being... Say...? Is this how you pay your respects to Stevan, Toma? Stevan died? When? Why didn't you tell me? You have better things to do. Praise Jesus. God bless you. Praise Jesus. What did he die of so suddenly? Ulcer... You know he had them. It burst. His wife went with him. They say the doctors are to blame. I guess they're bloodthirsty as well. Or maybe they're just ignorant. Who knows? Why didn't you kill that gypsy? I could have buried him as well. I'm not a killer. I merely arrest them. But you will kill, Toma. Because you're a volunteer. And the volunteers always kill. You will kill. Tonka... Joza... Listen up... I know I'll never be able to replace your father and your mother. But in this house you will be treated as if you are my children. Where will I sleep? With Tonka and Reza. With the girls? Only over my dead body. I'd rather sleep on this bench here. Be quiet. You'll sleep where you're told. Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Don't be angry, Sima. You are the least suspicious, now that your brother is dead. And we have important business. Oh, well, someone has to fill all those freshly dug graves. Tonka, bring us some if there's any left. Reza, give us glasses. They followed each other into the grave. Yes, they did. Like all those people who walked by today. Straight to heaven. What are you going to do now with these two children? I'll feed them. Until you or the Ustasha get them killed. Maybe it's for the best. There'll be fewer of us here on Earth. Those who survive will live better. Tell me, Sima... Why do you help us when you're against us? Because I have to... There's a war on... It's our duty to help ourselves and others. But you disagree with us. I disagree... But I'll need your help if you win the war. And if you expect help from someone you have to help them in return. Cheers! Cheers! Come on... Attention! Attention! The latest information and orders! The High Command of the Croatian Home Guard is letting you know that all the young men in the village of Ladimirevci, born in the year 1926, Uncle, the mare has arrived! Sima! Sima! Shall we? Yes! Let's go. Come on! Jesus, Sima! That horse'll kill you! Move you mares! This mare could lose her will, damn it. Now, Sima, be careful... Now you have to hold on... Let them smell each other. Take it easy. Take it easy. Hey there, Falcon! Let's go! Hello, soldier! Hello! Brother! Hey, sister! I wish that idiot of my son would come home. He will. He will. He'll come home... in a coffin. Let's go. Hello, son. Hello, dad. God bless! Death to fascism, Benos! Guests. Partisans. These days everyone's got their side. How's it going, neighbours? Of all the uniforms, you had to choose the German? Who let him choose, Andra? He had to. He still has to. It looks good on me. You don't want to be buried in it. It's you, Moca! You scared me, you fool! Don't shoot! I almost killed you! Why are you walking around in that uniform? Everybody knows me! Someone might mistake you! You partisan! You Gerry! Let's get a drink! - I'm on duty. I can see that. I'm a connection. I recruit people in the Partisans. D'you want to join? If my uncle hadn't died, dad would let me. This way I have to help feed a family of five. So do we. I seem to be interrupting you. You should get back to work, Moca. Jesus, I'm still shaking. I almost shot him. Why didn't you tell me he's on leave? How should I know what I'm allowed to say? I'll show you... This is the last one. Leave before they see you. I don't know where to go. I'm going to report Moca for his behaviour today. Wasting time on his private affairs. Human not private. Are you for working or making love? I'm for both if at all possible. It's not possible! If the commanders find out, they'll shoot the lot of us. Where are we going? The falcon's crying. Even the dogs are crying. Animals always become upset when something bad's happening. Good or bad, Sima, but we can't go on like this. Benos should have come with us. Sometimes you have to take risks. I'm taking risks. Here and now. So Benos doesn't have to. This isn't a business so that he who dares wins. War demands a different calculation. We'll discuss this further. There's nothing to discuss. Andra! You sleep in in my house! You use my fields as a meeting place Benos is not going in to the Partisans. You'll pay for this, Moca! I collected my pay for the whole year. Let's go! Come on! Andra? Can you guarantee that no one will harm our families? On my word! The Germans and the Ustasha are too busy with us to send peasants to camps. If you say so. Sima... Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come on, for fuck's sake! Everyone else is harvesting, and you Sima are slaughtering. It hasn't eaten or moved for four days. I had to kill it. What are you gonna do with the meat? There's a war on and you're asking what I'll do with the meat. I get the liver? Right, Sima? It's sick. It's yours. Has Benos left? He's leaving tomorrow. Then he'll take some with him. Whom is joining? What do you mean whom? As if there aren't enough of them to choose. He's certainly not joining your son. No family of mine is joining the Ustasha. As if the ones he's joined are any better. The Germans are even worse. He didn't volunteer. He was recruited and then sold by our glorious Croatian army. Sima! Have you heard? Hitler's freed Mussolini! We're joining forces again! Together, we win for sure! You'll go to hell, for sure. Stop! I'll shoot! Where are you going? Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Where are you going? To Hell! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, you fool! Wait... Stop... - Leave me alone! Stop! - Leave me alone! Why are you sending me to the camp? Why me, you pieces of shit? You rotten bastards! I didn't send my son to the woods! It's just temporary. Who took my son away? Who is harboring the Partisans? Who is he? May he rot in Hell! Move! Stop whining! Stop whining! Everything's gonna be alright! Hurry up! Hurry up! This is a real dirty job, uncle! Isn't it better to plow the fields? My field, Benos, is overgrown as if it's been abandoned. You over-fertilized it. I'll be seeing you. I'm leaving tomorrow. When? Before dawn. I'll wake up. I might never come back. Nonsense. There's a war on! So, we should say our goodbyes as if we'll never see one another again. Don't say that. Come to me. Why? So we can say our goodbyes. How? So... How? Stop asking the same question. Hello. Hello. I'm so stupid! That's how everyone else says goodbye. If that's what you want then follow Martaca. You can say goodbye to her. Don't go! Praise God! Always and forever! It's good you're back, Benos. Take this. Why? Take it up to the attic. You'll sleep there. Why in the attic? Come. Father said you have to be careful. As of tomorrow no one can see you not even Margita or the neighbours. They might report you're hiding. Why should I hide? My leave's up, I'm off tomorrow. Sima has decided you're not going back. He's taken some meat up to Ivica the Lawyer in Osijek. I don't know anything else. I could be shot for this! Everyone will be looking for me. No they won't. We've sent a telegram to your commander that you're in hospital in Osijek. What am I doing in hospital? I'm as healthy as a bull! Mother! They say that in war everything can be bought with pig meat. He's out of his mind. He'll end up in a camp. Don't you worry about him. We have to save your life. No father wants to see his son come to any harm. It's finished. By God, it's finished. Release it. Now take it to Sima. And don't return without the money. Watch out. The glorious German army won't drive over mud. Only planks. They're driving straight to Moscow! They're driving straight to Hell not Moscow. All those planks gone to ruin. Have you seen this, Sima? I wanna cry over these planks, God damn them all. No more barrels! What am I supposed to do now that they've destroyed all these planks? Stop complaining. They're being put to good use. You should be proud. For Berlin! For Berlin? Give me that wheel, Joza! I'll roll it to Berlin. Tonka! Don't be stupid! Praise Jesus! Always, Gita! There's a raid, Benos! Hide! Good morning, auntie. Good morning, Toma. Sima... You have to give us two mares. They're needed at the front. We'll return them when the War's over. What do you mean give? What am I gonna live from? I know, Sima. I'm a peasant just like you. But I'm just following orders. Sign here. What a fair exchange! Horses for papers. You have Falcon. Put him to work. He isn't doing anything anyway. Be happy it's only horses they're looking for. They might look for something else. Be careful, Sima. Come on. Move. Come on! Move! Falcon! Falcon! Move! Come on! Let's go. Come on. Yes. Come on. Shall we, Falcon, or shall we not? You won't do as I say, huh? Keep going, come on! Lover-girl, has that boyfriend of yours come by? The proletarian? - Who's that? Stop pretending. I have to get Benos into the Partisans. It's too late, Sima. Didn't I help as much as I could? They didn't accept your solution. Listen... I need a connection. I told you they're gone. They've retreated from the front. I'll kill you! One day... I'll kill you. What are you doing in the barn? Why did you hit him? He's mad! He won't be harnessed. Falcon isn't a working mare. Whom am I meant to harness? You? You stupid bastard! For God's sake! It's almost over, Benos. Hang on just a while longer. The war could last for years! The Russians aren't in a hurry. But I am! I can't stand this any longer, dad! I can't. Don't be scared, it's only me. I brought you an apple. I can't say anything. Does it hurt? Either I'll break, or I'll kill myself. What's up, Gita? Partisans? Where are you? Answer if you dare! Get out of your hidey holes! Sima! Sima! Where are you? - What? What is it you hoodlum? What is it you drunk? You've been drinking since last night. You've been shouting for Partisans all night. Give me some tea and some rum. Would you like some milk? Here, have some. It's still warm. I'm not a child, auntie. Come on. Bring me some. Oh, alright then. It's all over, Sima! It's all over. They kill you as soon as you peak over your own fence. Those Communist fucks! Why don't they come out in the open for a fair fight? So, you've been killing as well? No. - You shot a gypsy! It wasn't me. My soldiers killed him. I fired into the air. That's my war. I shot into the air. D'you wanna see? There's no need. I shot into the air. I shot into the air, Sima! Stop shooting, you fool! Stop shooting! What? Am I gonna kill the air? The air keeps evading my bullets. You didn't shoot the air. You shot my roof. Everything's fine up here, uncle. I'll fix everything. Leave that machine gun. Have something to drink. Give! - Hope it's your last. Do you want some, Sima? God damn right I will. They didn't bring it out just for you. I have something to celebrate now. Are you celebrating something today? This was a raid. Just so you know. I'll say I didn't find anything. But be careful. Others might come as well. If they don't believe me... And don't shoot into the air. And now... Hit it! Well, Hans... Goodbye. You'll be back. You'll be back. Gita! Oh, God, Tonka... It's so nice to hear you sing again. I hope dad won't mind. I've been in mourning for three years. Why would they mind? I prefer your singing, anyway, to your bell ringing. Someone has to ask God for help. God sees everything. He knows everything. Sometimes I think he's forgotten about us. It'll take a while before Benos forgets about his Margita. Take your brother his supper. Why is it always me? Stop complaining and take it to him. Children, you're wasting light. Day is for reading. Day is for digging and plowing and taking the cows to pasture. Am I supposed to work for your books on my own? What a man! For God's sake, Sima, it's not his fault. Why is he always annoying me? He has to work. And have it as tough as I did. I had it tough... I bled... I died... I can't do it anymore. Sima, I have to share something with you. A secret I've been keeping. I'm sorry but I have to say it. Reza is pregnant. Oh, my dear... She forgot her forest dweller quickly. She didn't forget him. The child is Moca's. Get up Reza! What's going on? Get out there! I'm glad I'll be a grandfather. But why for God's sake didn't you tell me Moca had been here? He told me not to tell anyone. He said they'd kill him if they knew he was coming here. And you didn't tell me just because he had forbidden you to? I couldn't betray him. Betray him? You were gonna betray by telling me? How should I know? I just wanted the best for everyone. The best for him because I love him. And look what he left me in haste. So why'd you betray him now? I have to give birth. You'd betray me and your mother and the country just because you have to give birth. - Sima! You bloody bitch in heat! Moca could have been our connection! Connection! Oh, so they're nearby. You're close... But you've abandoned me now. Now that I need you the most. You goddamn rotten Partisan bastards! Sima! Have you seen this embarrassment? They've stolen all the planks from Belis. What's with my axle? To hell with you and your axle! Who's gonna drive on that road? You thieves! You gangsters! They'll kill us all, these swine. The thieving bastards! Fuck you and Ante Pavelic and Hitler! He has a son. He's one of ours. He had... You check the hay. You check the barn. Hurry! Faster! Dear God... What do you want, people? Is Benos at home? He's gone. Left to join his unit. Which one? The one he was in. When? Fifteen months ago. And who's this? I'm listening? That's my son. Choose, mother. Either you'll give him to us... I'd sooner kill him. You don't have to kill him. I will. Sima's ours. He didn't mean it. Stop playing games, old man. For your own good. I hope you all rot in Hell. You'll all go to Hell! God damn you! Judas! It's your fault! Mother! - You'll rot in Hell too. Mother! Don't! - Do something! Do something! Help us, people! People! People! Do you know who's coming? Two partisans! Brand new! Hello Joca! Hello. Welcome, Moca! Hello. God bless you, my children. You're back. Have you seen my Benos? Oh, mother. If he'd gone with them he'd be back now too. Stop talking nonsense. Come in. Come in. Come in. Welcome to my house, lads. Welcome Moca and Joca. Make yourselves at home. Come on. Give the lads something to drink. How was your trip? Fine. As long as you've arrived here safely. Cheers. Where's Benos? We have no news, for now. Everyone's coming back. God help us. Ah, here we are. Here we are. Mine? Whose else? Is it a boy? - Yes. What's his name? Filip. Like your late father. Well, in connection to that. I'm here to talk about the wedding. My God. You're getting married and Benos isn't here. God will strike you down. He'll strike you down, you old hag. Worry about your problems. Like you. I see you're only worried about yourself. Go to... Go to Hell! What? Why are you staring at me? Stop staring! This is the road down which all all the living will return home. Andra! Stop that. Stop it! Get off you Ustasha swine! Marta! Have you seen Benos? Step back, comrade. Mom. Benos! Brother? Brother! I'm fine. Toma! Get a move on! Where are you taking them? You know. Don't! They're innocent! Auntie! Beg for us! How's the work coming along? It's coming along. Listen, Bona... Don't ask me. The boss is inside. And now for the most important. If you do decide, after all, to plant wheat. The great Russian scientist Tzitzin has crossed wheat with couch. You plant it once you'll harvest it for three years. Brother peasants, long live comrade Tito and comrade Stalin! Death to fascism, freedom to the people. What's up, Sima? Why are you sad? One man's sunset is another's sunrise. You know how it goes. Get him out. You know he's innocent. Everyone's innocent now. You should have thought of that earlier. You didn't mind my help. There was a war on. It still is, for me. When can I see him? It's better that you don't. Next. Next. Name? Tomislav Milosic. Date of birth? 1913. 13th battalion. To the right. Go on? What are you staring at? Next. Benos. Tonka will have something to ring for. Name? Name? Benos Begovic. Date of birth. 1922. 13th battalion. To the right. Leave him. Ustasha? I'm not an Ustasha. They arrested me and made me join. Go to the left. Next. Hello comrade. - Hello! Begovic! From your gran and your mother. We'll get you out. Kill me. It's the only way to save me. Come on! That's enough! Send them my regards. And Falcon too. Of course. Stop. Just like that. Here it is. Give twenty. Hello! Good day. I've always felt at home in here. We always ate well here. We always felt safe. Cheers. Right, Sima! I measured your wheat today. As you won't join the collective, you owe the country 120 meters. You have 40 left, which is more than enough to feed six. And then I'll chew on spider's webs. Why don't you join the collective? You won't? And... What if it would help Benos? Oh, Andra! Why are you so surprised? Many never leave the camp. Especially those with rich fathers. You must understand, Sima! If those upstairs here that I am protecting the father of an Ustasha who won't join the collective they'll kill both me and Benos! But if you were to join us... I won't let you have my land! That's it! Alright, Sima. Alright. Wait. When do I have to decide? Now! That's it! Get to work, lads! I'll be right back. Hurry up, lads! Stop! As far as I know, this is still my yard. The yard is yours, but the wheat isn't. But there'll be none left for me! You have a first class plot of land. Don't you dare talk to me about class! You classless bastard! You former town-crier. You recent Partisan! I'm a worker now, but you're still a kulak! I wasn't born one! I worked to become one! While you slept and drank! But now you're cleaning my barn out? You have to give to the state! I won't! I won't even if you kill me! Don't! Don't! I won't give it, you bastards! Is this why you sent me to the camp? Is this why you godless, heartless lot? Go drive the machines for the collective! That's where you belong! Leave me alone, you rotten fucks! You Partisan thieves! You thieves! You gangsters! Fuck you! Fuck your mothers! Your rotten mothers. Thanks for the help, comrade Joca. Fuck off, you vulture. Sima, I have two good news for you. First, we got a commendation from the committee. We're the best in the region. We're getting a flag. And the other? The other? Hurry up, you two! Brother! There is a God! Aren't you happy, Sima? I am, Andra. Thank you. I wouldn't have helped Benos, if he weren't innocent. My beautiful Falcon! Stop! Stop! Hello there! The wedding party is here! Give the bride! The groom is here! What is it, Sima, again? Why the long face? How long are you gonna be mad for? Forever, Bona! Forever! Then I'll go. - Wait! There's no one better than you. You're marrying your daughter. You've got your son back! Enough politics! We're getting married. That's right! Enough! Start playing! Wait! Stop dancing! Stop! Where are the girls? Are we gonna wait forever? What's up, girls? Come out here, stop peeping! Come Reza! Come Tonka! Come on! The grooms are waiting! I'm asking for a blessing from our Lord, and the blessed virgin Mary, from all the saints, from my father and my mother, my brothers and my sisters and all my kin and kind. May God help you. I'm asking for a blessing from our Lord, and the blessed virgin Mary, from all the saints, from my father and my mother, my brothers and my sisters, and all my kin and kind. May God help you. I'm asking for a blessing from our Lord, and the blessed virgin Mary, from all the saints, from my father and my mother, my brothers and my sisters, and all my kin and kind. May God help you. Get going! Come on! Come on! Why are you sad, for Heaven's sake? Start playing! I'll tame you yet! On your mother's blood! I fed you, I'll tame you! SUBTITLES BY Mateja Djedovic
