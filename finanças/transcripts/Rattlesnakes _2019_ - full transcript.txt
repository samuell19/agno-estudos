So, how's the schedule looking? I'm down to my last client now, so I might come home early in three or four hours. I'll see you then. So. Here's the plan. Reported that the old fire hall is still burning out of control. There are no reports of injuries, but a three block area has been evacuated. And to business the stock market fell through the floor today. No one seems to have predicted this, so it's hard to know where it's heading. Stay in the moment. Breathe. That's it. That's it. And drink. Police in Canada have smashed up a multi-million dollar drug smuggling ring. Police say the raid was centered in Columbia with drugs finding their way into large city centers. 25 people have been arrested, and face charges ranging from distributing to possession for the purpose of trafficking.

He's figured out who I am. And now I want the truth. Are you fucking my wife? Grab his head. What? Grab his head! What? No, no, no, no! No, no! No! Stop it, stop it! Stop, stop, stop! No! Alright, that's enough! - We agreed. - It's answers first. Are you fucking my wife? He thinks we're assholes. I say we fuck him up. What are we waiting for? Are you sleeping with my wife? No. I'm a therapist. I feel we have danced like this a thousand lifetimes before. Fucking liar! I am not gonna have this smug little prick play fucking mind games with me. I'm a therapist. I'm treating her. For what? We are bound by patient-client confidentiality. Well, right now you're bound by duct tape, asshole. I treat people who have problem: mental problems, physical problems, spiritual problems. We know all about your fucking little immigrant hustle. You're an escort. I say we fuck him up. No, I am a therapist. In a rented apartment in the middle of the fucking night? In your car? Yeah, he's all fucking class, this guy. I can explain. I treat them. I treat all your wives. Lizzy Hanson, Esther Jarret, Susie Ellis. Check in my pants you will see my ID. I'm legally licensed. Holy shit he's not lying. So, you're a licensed therapist who fucks his clients? No, I help them with their problems. Are you listening to this? Where do you get your fucking balls big enough? You see the clothes this guy has on? Look at that shirt he's wearing. How much of my money paid for that shirt? How much? - Alright, calm down. How much do they pay for your treatments? Depends on their problems. Each case is different. How much did my wife pay? Per hour! Admit it you fucked my little Susie, didn't you? Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. How much did she pay you? $275 an hour. What? $275 per hour? Does she owe you money? No, she doesn't. Do you know how much fucking money? Do you know how much money I make? How long have you slept with Susie? Like I said I treat her. How long? Answer him! About five months. And Lizzy? Maybe six. How did it all start? Through referrals. - Referrals? - Referrals? What? Yeah, I'm a therapist. I have a business. I have a list of private clients. I'm very selective. So, who referred Susie? I said I cannot tell you. So, it's just a business. You pay taxes. You provide insurance? I'm not out to hurt anyone. I'm just there to save them. Save them? Yes, save them from themselves. You just manipulate women, don't you? I am not the bad guy here. So, who is? You tell me, I mean. Don't you get smart with me. Then why did she pay you? You don't wanna know. - Why? - Answer him! Fucking answer him! Why do you think she comes to see me? Why do you think all your wives come to see me? You better be careful. I wanna know why Lizzy lied about bridge night on Tuesday and girls' night out on Thursday. I'm gonna find out, and if I don't get a satisfactory answer, we are gonna fuck this bastard up. Listen, they trust me, and I'm just there for them. They want to talk, and I listen to understand them to help them, to help them become wives again, to help them become better women. How dare you sit there and talk about my woman like that? You don't know her. "My woman," you see that's the problem. She is someone's daughter or sister. My wife she's not a thing. She's not a piece of meat. There are a few things she deserves. She wants to be respected. She wants to be loved. So, you make 'em feel loved. Make 'em feel wanted? You see, we connect. We talk. We sit. We watch TV. Sometimes I read to them and they fall asleep. I give them what they're missing. It's not about sex. Well, then what are you talking about, fucking respect, making them feel special? I'm not here to break your marriages. I'm actually helping them. I should cut your cock off. Then we'd see how you'd be there to help them. I am happily married myself. Married you're a fucking liar. Look at my phone I have pictures. 69-11-69. I even have a beautiful daughter. You're all a drain on society. So, how does your wife feel about what you do? She understand that I'm helping people. It's not personal. Oh, hold on. Let me get this straight. You fuck my wife and I pay you, and it's not personal. I'm simply feeding my family. Oh, you know, I'd feed her. Yeah, she's not bad. Actually, you know what I'd fuck her. How would you like that? How would you like if I'd fuck your wife, huh? I'd give her the ride of her life. Susie was right about you. What did you say? I said that Susie was right about you. Why do you think she comes to see me? Because you sleep with her. No, wrong answer. Why? Because I work hard and I work late? No. Then why? Because you are in denial. You're losing your business. Close to bankruptcy. - Shut up! You can't repay your creditors. You're one of his creditors, right? I said shut up. Unless you know about this. You know what you have no backbone. You are gutless. It's okay. - You're yella! - I said shut the fuck up. Fucking my wife. Giving her the ride of her life. How you gonna do that? You can't even get it up. You're impotent. She called you Viagra. Get it? Can't get it up? The thing is your wife needs sex. She's not had sex for years. Well, good morning, sunshine. Tell me about my money. Go get that hammer. You can still let me go. I'm not gonna say anything to the police. No one needs to know. Tell me what you and Lizzy were planning to do with my money. I said go get that hammer! If you tell me about the money, I can make this stop. It's up to you. No, no! What are you doing? - I'm gonna enjoy this more than you enjoyed fucking my wife. Where's that hammer? Get it in here. To that hands. - No, don't do this. Give it to him! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Give it to him! - No, no, don't do this! No, don't do it, don't do it! - Give it to him! - You are not like him. - Give it to him! You're better than him. Come on, you pussy! You know it. Don't, don't! No, don't it. - Do it! Do it! - You are not like him! - Shit. Hey, you alright? I'm sorry, I just... I couldn't. It's alright, it's alright don't worry about it. We just gotta get back inside let's go. No, I can't do this. I'm sorry. No, listen we all agreed. We agreed we were gonna strip him, beat him, throw him in the grave to scare the shit out of him, you know and then send him home with a final warning, but not this. I know, I know. This is way out of hand. I know Jarret's out of control. I know, you know that I know. I don't like you. Listen, I'm sorry about the business. I was gonna tell you I just didn't know how. I don't give a shit about the business. No, I was trying to fix it, but then I just it got worse. I'm fucked. I fucked up. I understand, it's okay. But I swear to you, you're gonna get paid. Everyone's gonna get paid. I'm gonna pay you back. - It's okay, listen. Everybody is gonna get paid back! I've already taken care of it! Do you understand? What do you mean? What do you mean you've taken care of it? You're not taking my business. Lizzy's gonna be here any second. Come on, let's go. - No, I'm not going back! Okay, then get out of here, alright, go! This night he said he was ready not to report it. We can all walk away from this. I'm gonna handle it, okay? I'm gonna fucking handle it like I handled everything. Now get out of here! I'm telling you, you're not taking my business. Over the fence same way you came in. You're not taking my business. Don't let 'em see you. Don't you dare, don't! No, no! - Oh yeah! No! Stop! Enough! Fuck! He had it coming. Look, we agreed. We're gonna humiliate him, scare him a little bit and then cut him loose. - Where's Ellis? - He's gone. That fucking coward. What is it with you and these questions? He's got answers I want 'em! Lizzy's gonna be here at 11:30. - That's right. - Yeah. I feel sorry for her. What the fuck are you mumbling about, huh? I feel sorry for Esther. She used to pay me just to cry over you. That psychoanalysis bullshit don't work with me. Why you don't wanna hear about the truth? About her secrets? Jamie Jarret. You think the entire world owes you. That's not true. Nobody gives a fuck, and that's killing you. That's why you drink, you fucking drunk! Oh, boy. - Watch your head. - Okay, okay, okay. Thank you, thank you. Come on, for Christ sakes where's my dinner? I asked for it, like, 10 minutes ago! - It's coming, it's coming. - Yeah, well come on please! Just what the? Clean that up! You bring salad to the table that's got no dressing on it! Clean it up! You know, I feel bad for her. I feel bad for your sister 'cause she loves him. What the fuck have you been doing all day, huh? What the fuck have you been doing all day? Get me another beer, now! She loves you, and that's killing her. The truth is without her you you're nothing. Just fucking lost, you fucking moron, and you know it. You just keep talking shit, boy. I'm gonna knock that fucking smile off your face. Oh, yeah? What about the headaches, huh? Let's talk about the headaches. Wait a minute. What about her headaches? Why do you think she goes in the hospital every week, huh? Why do you think, what causes the imbalance? What the fuck is he talking about? How can you do that to a woman? Your sister what are you gonna do about it? Shut your lying filthy! Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Stop, you're gonna kill him! You'll kill him! Stop! Fuck him! He's been beating your sister. - This is it! - No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! - This is how rude! Is that true? Yeah, I have pictures on my phone. 69-11-69. He's a fucking liar. You've been beating Esther? - He's lying! - You marinate yourself in vodka and you beat my sister! Fuck you, Richie, what have you ever done for me? Are you fucking kidding me? I've been carrying you for years. Oh, you employ me so now you own me? All she does is take care of you and you beat her? You abuse her like a punk? Fuck you! Fuck. Fuck. I never hit her. - Ah. She's dying. She's dying from a brain tumor. She wanted you to be the last one to know. She wanted you to feel guilty, to feel pain the way she's felt for years, every single day. Dead. Dead but smiling, because then she'll be free. Esther's dying? You ever touch my sister again and I'll kill you. You understand me? What you're gonna take his word over mine? Do you want me to look? You said family should stick together. You're not my family. You don't work for me you're fired. This is over get the fuck out of here. You know what, Richie, fuck you. I'm sorry. We never should've done this to you, and that's my fault. So, how about I just cut you loose, and we forget this whole thing ever happened? Okay. My fingers are broken. I'll take you to the hospital. I'll pay for it. Here. It's okay. I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to press charges. Press charges against who? You guys or your wife, Lizzy? My wife? Yeah. She scares me. She scares you? All my other clients understand that I have a family, a wife and a beautiful daughter. But Lizzy she would not leave me alone. That scares me. You're sleeping with my wife, and my wife scares you? I have not slept with your wife. Don't bullshit me! I have never slept with your wife. All that is just a big misunderstanding. Your wife she will not leave me alone. She calls me all the time, calling me, calling my cell, my house. She even call me sometimes when she's in bed with you. I've known my wife for five years. We've been married for four. You do not know your wife, believe me. The other day she sent me a video of my wife shopping with my kid. How does she know my wife, huh? Maybe you're telling the truth, but maybe you're not and maybe you deserve this. Maybe this is karma. Do you know your wife has a gun? - A gun? - Yeah. She says she will kill me. She will kill my family, and then she'll kill herself. This is bullshit! You're telling me I don't know my wife? I don't think you do know your wife. You have to understand that. She's not who you think she is. Your wife is... For me she's crazy. Please check yourself. You're right. I don't know my wife Lizzy. Lizzy doesn't love me anymore. All I ever wanted was to have a child with her. I think you need to hear her for yourself. You need to understand what's going on. Why don't you go to the closet, wait for her to come, then you'll hear and then you will understand. Karma. That's Her Majesty. Answer it. On speaker. Hi. Are you there? - Hi. Is there a problem? No, all is well here. Waiting for you. Okay. How long before you get here? Five to 10 minutes. Okay, five to 10 minutes I'll be here. I'll be there soon. See you shortly. And also, I know about the money. There's something she's going to do regarding your business. What, what is she planning? It's not very clear, but I'm sure I can find out. How do I know this isn't a setup? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - Watch out. Fuck, what happened to you? I'm okay. What happened to you god? I was attacked by a bunch of drunk guys. Oh, sweetheart, you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm never gonna let anybody hurt you, sweetheart. I know. Are you okay? Yeah, can you get me some water please? I'm never gonna let anybody hurt you. Oh, my god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I love you. I love you. Do you remember the beautiful day at the beach, beautiful sunset? Dance with me. Yeah. Dance like we have danced a thousand lifetimes. Yeah, that's it. Oh, sweetheart. Sweetheart. In all my dreams, I never imagined that this day would come. I mean you and me right here, right now, just like this. You fixed me. You made me strong. You put me back together again. You saved me. You saved me. You fixed my heart. I know it. You know, now it's our time. You know what? Look, look at this. I got it. It's everything. It's everything that we need for the house in Thailand to get set up. Everything we need for a new life together. It's just you and me. We've got it! I can't do this anymore, I can't. - Huh? - Listen. I just can't do this anymore. Listen. What? I'm never gonna leave my family. This is a beautiful dream, but let's get back to reality. I'm sorry I don't understand what you're saying. That story of soulmates and all that crap. I think your imagination just went wild. What about your wrist? Lizzy, I was just doing my job. I don't understand. So, you don't wanna be with me? You said that you loved me. You said that you wanted to be with me forever. I was just doing my job, alright? I was doing my job. Lizzy. Get off of me! Get off! - Lizzy. - Go away from me! Please stop it don't do that again. What the fuck are you talking about? Go away! - You're scaring me. - What the fuck is your problem? - You are scaring me. - What about soulmates? What about our parents? What about our parents? You said that our parents both died to same way! You said that! Is that true? Is that true? Is that true? No. You said we were soulmates! What have you done to my life?

You said that we were together! You said that we were together forever and you wanted to be with me forever no matter what! - What about your husband? - What do you mean, what about my husband? Don't you love him? What are you talking about? We've talked about this a thousand times! You know what that was about! What are we about? - You're gonna break his... - No! - He needs you. You love me! What are you fucking doing? I don't understand! It's not about me. No, it's not. It's about me now, and I don't need you. I don't need you! I don't need you anymore! I don't need you! - You're crazy! I have got everything that I need! - Lizzy, you're crazy! - No! - I mean, stop it! - You stop it! - Stop it! You're the one that's fucking crazy. You're just a fucking hustler. Oh, it's not about the sex! It's not about the sex! Oh, we're just playing. It is not about the sex. You're just playing. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, I'm just here to help you, baby. I just want to make everyone so fucking happy, baby! You're just a bullshitter! You're a fucking bullshitter! Look at me! You think I'm a fucking fool? Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Clearly, you have mistook my kindness for weakness, but I see right through you! You told me that you wanted to have my baby. You told me to get rid of his baby. I did that. I got rid of his baby for you, so I could have your baby! I'm having your baby! What are you talking about? Help me. Help me. Help me. In another lifetime, Lizzy Hanson, maybe things will be different. I can't stop thinking about you. I know you feel the same. Come on, admit it. I can't leave my husband. We are soulmates, Lizzy. What about Richie? He doesn't understand, doesn't connect with you. - No, stop it. - I need you. Just stop it! We can be together, Lizzy. A child with someone I can connect with. You're right. - I love you. We're soulmates. I love you. We need the gun for security, for our security. How did you find me? You just tell me what you want I'll do it. I feel we have danced like this a thousand lifetimes before. That's it. - Stop it. That's it. Oh god, I love you. Hey, darling. This tooth fairy's on his way to his daughter with a tooth. Rough day? Mm. Kind of. Did she bring the money? Yeah, she brought the money. On the need of the person. Whatever you need, you know, I can provide. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - I appreciate you.
