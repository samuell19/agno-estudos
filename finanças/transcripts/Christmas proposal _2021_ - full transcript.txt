- Evenin', Lieutenant. - Good evening, Corporal. I'm surprised you're still here. - Yeah, I was just leavin' out. - Well, congratulations are in order. - Congratulations for what? Well, remember when you came here all hot, and bothered, and angry at the world? - That was about a year ago. Yeah, well, you're headin' to Japan, son. - It was a mistake. I'm past that now. You know? - Well, a mistake, huh? Well, we all make mistakes, but PC is mandatory. You're shippin' out. Orders are orders. - Japan? Is it permanent? - Mmm, yeah, 10, 15 years. - 15! I have a girlfriend, Lieutenant. I can't do that. - Well, hopefully it's not the same girlfriend that you were trying to get rid of. I mean, if you loved her as much as you love those shoes that you always buy, then we wouldn't be havin' this conversation, now, would we? She could stay here. - For 15 years? Yeah, and by the end of the year, you all can get married. - She's not gonna do that . Hmm, sorry to hear that, but congratulations. - What's goin' on, Earl? - Come on, Cuz. There you go with this Earl, man. I told you, it's 2 Easy Dollars, man. Gotta talk money just to say my name, Cuz. Anyway, man, I need a favor from you, Cuz. - What is it now? Well, you know me, Cuz. I'm in the studio doin' my thing. Mm-hmm. - Hot fire! Hot fire, Cuz, you know? - Sure. - Got this little track I'm workin' on, Cuz, you know? I might need to use your headphones, man. - What headphones, Earl? You took my last two pair, remember? Them yours, Cuz? My fault, man. You know, don't even worry about that, Cuz. Anyway, you sure you got somethin' goin' on, man? - You owe me for those headphones, Earl. I got you, Cuz. You already know that, man. - Anyway... I... Let's go outside. Come on. Come on, man! - Cuz, you ain't got her pregnant, do you, man? Don't go to Maury, man. I think he them people. - Come on! About a year ago, man. I got upset with Carla over something stupid. I marched right into my lieutenant's office, and requested to be shipped away as far as possible, as soon as possible. And it went through. What? - To Japan for 15 years. Come on, Cuz, man! That girl got your head all messed up, man. You don't even know how to eat with chopsticks, man! That's crazy, man. I guess congratulation, I guess. - No, no! No, no, no, no. Carla doesn't even know. And she can't even go with me unless we're married by New Year's. Come on, Cuz. First thing I'd tell you, man, you go ahead and leave, man. Tell her you got the COVID or somethin'. You can't come back, man. Quarantined. - That's not a good idea. Earl, that's not a good idea, man. - Blame it on Biden, man. I'm telling you, Cuz. - Look, Carla is the type of woman to fly to Japan just to kill me. So that's not quite a good idea, Earl. - Well, if you tell her before you leave, man, she gonna kill you anyway, man. At least you'll get a chance to get some sushi or somethin', Cuz. Come on, Cuz. You're makin' it too complicated, man. All you gotta do is get her to marry ya, man. Do somethin' special, Cuz. Get her all happy, man. And then when she most vulnerable, Cuz, she'll say yes to anything, man. But when? - Well, hey, Cuz, if it was me, man, I already know when it'll be, man. But see, you might not be blessed in the same area as I am, Cuz. I think you get that from your momma's side of the family, man. You might wanna wait till she with her folks or somethin', man. Around the holiday or somethin', Cuz. - That's the smartest thing you said this whole conversation. - Word, Cuz? - Christmas, that's a good idea. - I know it is, man. Didn't I say it, Cuz? Come on, baby. This is Earl, baby. - Mm-hmm. - 2 Easy Dollars, baby. You know what I mean? - Mm-hmm, uh-huh. - You do this right, Cuz, man. Make her happy. And make sure she's vulnerable, she'll say yes to anything, man. - Well, this better work. - Of course it's gonna work, man. You know it- - And I want my money for my headphones. Come on, Cuz!

That's genius, baby. Who else is doin' that? - Well, I got the idea of Pinterest, so a lot of people. It's a genius idea, babe. - Are you sure? - Yes! - Okay. - Matter of fact, look, look, look. I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna put down all the ingredients to the T, so I can make sure you have everything you need. Now you're just being weird! - Babe, we need to talk. - Is everything okay? Kinda. You know... You remember when we got into that little situation- - Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Zeke called earlier. He's been following everything that's goin' on overseas, and Japan is absolutely insane, babe. I'm so thankful that you aren't stationed there right now. I know it's crazy here in America, but over there, the killings have gotten out of hand. - Mm-hmm. - I realized today, that I would rather be homeless, and hungry, and alone than live in Japan. I can't imagine what it's like over there. I didn't mean to cut you off. What were you gonna say? - I love you. Oh, I love you too. There was a call that I need to make. Okay. - I almost forgot.

Just enjoying the moment, man. - You're sittin' here duckin' and bouncin' back and forth like someone's shootin' at you. I'm just enjoying my time with your family during Christmas. Stand up. Stand up! Lock it up. What do you know about family? - I'm a very family-oriented man myself, and I can tell you really love your family. I mean, you guys have a celebration every year. You make sure your daughter's there every year. You know, I make sure Carla is here every year because I love her, not because she's family. Now, my brother-in-law, he's family, and he ain't invited here. Listen, when you get a daughter that you love, that you care for, that you would sacrifice anything for, and she dies because of her bum boyfriend, then you can talk to me about family. - Hmm. I got another pie! - Thank you, mom. - You got another one? - A whole pie! Oh, my goodness! - This is amazing. I don't know if I can take anymore. Is everything okay, Dad? - Yeah, just wanna give thanks. - Sure. - Lord, thank you for family, and just keep those safe who can't be with us on this Christmas. - Amen. Let's have some pie. - Yay! - Mrs. Parker, the food was amazing. Thank you. - It is every year, Mama. It's delicious. - Yes, it was Mrs. Parker. I love me some soul food. It makes me feel black, like James Brown black. - Girl, what is your problem? - Just eat the dern pie! - I see where Carla gets it from. This girl can throw down in the kitchen. - All of my daughters can cook. Both of 'em. - Yes, sir. - How's college? - Things are, honest, a little bit weird with the virtual and then the campus being split. But it's okay this semester. Hybrid? - I was originally gonna do all online classes, but then I realized I missed my friends, and I missed my life, and I had to get out of the apartment. - And you're staying safe, right? - Yes, Dad, I'm staying safe. Even when they get the vaccine, I will continue being safe. - Okay, well, wear your mask, okay? I don't trust anyone. - I know, Dad. Like, I wear that- - I don't need to lose you too, okay? I need you here every Christmas. - Yes, sir. - Guess what, everybody? What? - Could you please go in the kitchen right there, and get me a box, please? - Sure. Yeah! - I'll get it. - It's okay, Carl. I asked him to do it. I know! I know a man's always supposed to help his wife. I don't need any help. I want him to do it. Honey, come on, man, chill. I think this is it? - Oh, my gosh! Mom, where did you find this? What's in there? - Oh, it's a box of my old memories. Okay. - Like, I had this. I got this when I was nine. It was my favorite present. It's why I like Christmas so much. - I had one of those. Awe! It looks amazing. Just lookin' back on things, like just to see how far we've come. - Oh, look at this! This is from your freshmen year in college. - Oh! - It's a phone case. ♪ I'm coming out ♪ Oh, gosh! Look! This is the list of my favorite gifts ever. - Oh! - Some of these I don't think you could find anymore. - Really? - What's that, Dad? Hey, what's that? - It's a picture of my sister, Chrissy. I'm sorry. - I'll get her. I'll get her, excuse me. - I'll be out in a minute. Carla, are you okay? - I'm fine, Jason. - How come you never keep pictures of your sister? I mean, that was my first time seein' her. Yeah. Sometimes it's just so hard. And it's a lot to put on my family. And dad blames himself for everything that happened. He still wears that guilt so heavy. - I can definitely tell. He's protecting you double times over. - He's scared he's gonna lose me too. - I mean, it looks like you guys were best friends. Yeah. Chrissy and I got into a lot of trouble growing up . - I see. Remember that time you told me about how you all snuck out to try to buy some alcohol for your parents' anniversary, and they thought you all were sneaking out to meet boys? Right. Didn't you say, Chrissy fell out the window or something? She was so clumsy. Like, how do you fall out of a first floor window? - Right. Baby, you know you can talk to me about anything, right? I know. I know. - Baby, I'm gonna give you some time to yourself, all right? And just holler at me when you come out. Thank you for checking on me. - Of course, babe. I can't do this. - What? What you mean, you can't do... What gonna happen now, man? The whole thing with her sister and everybody being emotional, it just feels wrong. Look, man, I'm just gonna wait till everything calms down, and I'm gonna tell her the truth. Talking about emotional stuff! Man, you sound like a girl right now, man! Tighten up, man! Being that she's emotional is the best time, man. That means she's vulnerable, Cuz. - I don't know, man. - I know you don't know, man. That's why you got me here, man. Now, use them emotionals as your friend, man. You need her vulnerable, so you can get her wrapped around your finger, man. - Okay. There's this Christmas list that she has. It has her favorite Christmas gifts on it, gifts that she's always wanted. - Shit, man! You done struck gold, Cuz. Now, you put that in your playbook, man. How many gifts is it, man? About five. - Five, Cuz? Well, that's it, man. It's five days till Christmas, man. You need to get started in the mornin', man. I gotta find a way to get this list without anyone knowing. Chocolate cosmos. Hi! What? - What are you doing? - I need a favor. - Laura, I'm not trying to be rude, but you're being a little annoyin' right now. - Uh-huh, I'm just asking for a favor. - I have something important that I have to do. I have to go now! - Okay, me too, and I need your help. - What is it? - I can't tell you here. - This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I don't have time for this. I gotta go now! Why doesn't anyone like me? - Jason, would you like to have some breakfast, sweetheart? - No, Mrs. Parker, I'm actually on my way out the door. - Hey, remember, a man should always help out when he can. - Hey! Are you gonna help me or what? - I guess. - Okay. Show me your fighting stance. - My what? - Your fighting stance. - Why? - Listen, I know you're up to something. You need to keep Carla happy. - How do you know that? I'm a neighbor. We know things. - Look, Laura, I have a mission impossible moment right now. I don't have time for this foolishness, okay?

You see what you made me do? My god. Are you okay? - The student has become the master. - Laura, what is really goin' on? What are you doin? I don't have time for this! You better know where those cosmos are at! - So you're gonna leave me for her, huh? - You left me for him? - You let me first! - You were probably with him the whole time! I've got too much class for that. - You married him? I knew it. Get him, Shawn! - Huh? - No! No, no, no! Get him! - Get who? Get him! - What you mean, "get him"? - Yeah. - No. No. - Cosmos! Uh-uh. Get him! - That's a dude! - So? I'm gay, but I'm not that gay! I said I would open doors for you and rub your feet. I didn't say nothin' about throwin' hands with a bunch of testosterone! You know what? I feel something! I've changed! I've changed! I am no longer gay! So I guess you don't need me anymore, Karen. - Cosmos. I don't like him. Daddy, you don't like nobody. That's my job. - Your opinion's irrelevant. Whatever. Why don't you like him? 'Cause I don't like him, that's why! - That's not a reason. That's my reason! That's all I need. - Oh, I can't with you. I can't. - Where's he at, hmm? Where's he at? - I don't know. - I've been callin'. - Where have you been? I have been calling you all afternoon, you and Laura, and neither one of you guys are picking up your phone! - I mean, Jason, we were worried about you. - Yeah, all of us. Jason, you realize, we do family stockings together every year. Oh, be right back. - You might be right. - Okay. Sorry, I just kinda got a little lost. Let me explain. There's this flower. It's a very, very rare flower that only grows in Mexico, and it's been extinct for like the last few years. Just listen. Being here with you all made me realize how important and rare Chrissy was. I know, I know. I hate to even bring it up. But I wanted to... I wanted to give you something that was just as rare and special as she is. Your chocolate cosmo. Oh my, god. Where did you get this? Laura helped me find it. - I haven't seen a flower like that since Chrissy passed. - It smells like chocolate. Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't even know how you take care of one of these things. - You're welcome. Mom, come help me find out. - You're trying to take my daughter from me. It's not gonna be easy. Yo, Earl. - Of course it is, Cuz. What did I tell ya, man? I bought her the first gift on the list, and it blew her mind. - Okay, Cuz. What was it, man? The chocolate cosmo flower. Jason? - Anyway, man, how it goin' with the folks, man? You gettin' in good with her dad, man? - I'm working on it! Listen, we're about to go play family charades, or something like that, so, you know, it'll give me more time to work on it. Okay. Sure. All right. Yeah, whatever, man. Bye. Oh! Hey, Mr. Parker.

She never had a chance to get it. - Oh, so this supposed to be special! - Yeah, man, it's a pretty big deal. You got it? - Give me $30. - $30? You said it was free. - It was, until you said it was special. - Oh, no, man! See, that's not... That's not fair, man. You tricked me! - $100. - $100! I don't even have 30. Come on, man. That's not nice. Come on, man. You know that's not nice. - You wanna go for 200? - Okay, okay, okay, see, now, we're bein' outrageous, man. Come on! What can I give you? I don't have $200 right now.

My favorite Christmas gift when I was a kid. - Yeah, I got it from this little boy. He had about eight, nine, of 'em. But he had these really expensive shoes on. They were actually really too big for his feet, but, you know, they were really expensive. They actually kinda looked like... Well, the ones you were wearing. - She looks just like me.

Are you serious? - What's up, Pops? - So were you planning on breaking my daughter's heart? - What are you talking about? - I know that you're going to Japan, and I know that you requested to go. - Listen. I just need more time, man. I'm gonna tell her. It would break her heart. - You know, I don't think that's the problem. The problem is, you're not man enough to tell her. - Sir, listen, I just need a little more time. - Get - I'm gonna tell her. - your hand off of me! You know what? You don't deserve to be in this family. You're a liar. - Jason, what's wrong? - Nothing, babe. - That didn't look like nothing. - Nothing! - Why are you raising your voice? - Listen, I'm sorry. - You never yell at me. - I got a lot goin' on right now. I don't need this. All right, Carl. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing? Out there is nothing? - You don't wanna know. - Carl, I'm your wife. I need to know, so tell me what's wrong! - Jason is getting transferred to Japan, and he hasn't told Carla. - Jason can't go, because they are not married. - No, Carla can't go, because they're not married. - There's gotta be some explanation. - You want an explanation? He's not man enough to tell her. You wanna know what he did? About a year ago, him and Carla were upset with each other. He went into his lieutenant's office, and he requested a transfer to get as far away from her as possible. - Oh, no. Oh, god. We gotta tell her. - Oh, no! We aren't telling her anything. We're not gonna break our daughter's heart. This is on him. - On him. What do you have against Jason? I mean, ever since he got here, you've been on his case!

So what is your motivation for school and going to college? - My motivation is my family. See, my mom was going to school to be an orthodontist as well, but she put that aside to take care of me and my sister, while my dad paid the bills- - I never seen footage like this before. How do you get it? - I got with some of Chrissy's friends from high school. They were able to give me the footage. - I love you.

That was my baby girl. I haven't seen her like that since she died. You win. - This is not a competition. - You win! Okay, you win. I don't understand this generation. When it comes to being sneaky, y'all are just pure genius. But when it comes to just telling the truth to someone you love, to your wife, to someone you care for, you're just the dumbest creatures on the planet! - Sir, with all due respect- - Just stop! Stop, stop! Just... You win. You gonna dance for us now? - Morning. Jason, what are you doing? - Did you drop something? - Carla, I know this is not on your Christmas list, and I know this is not a part of your Christmas tradition. I've never loved a woman the way that I love you. Your smile, your grace, your passion for people, your intelligence. I don't wanna go another day without you in my life. Carla Renee Parker, will you marry me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! - You can say no. - Yes, yes, yes! - Okay. Okay, you know what? You know what? Like I said, "You win". Now tell her. Tell me what? I'll tell you later. - Oh, no, no, no, no. If you're gonna go all the way with her, then go. - Carl, stop! What's he talking about, Jason? - We need to talk. We need to talk now. - Now he can be a man. - What is wrong with you? - Babe, promise me you will not get mad. - No, I won't promise you anything. - Okay. Remember when Zeke mentioned Japan? - Yes, but I'm not liking how this is starting to sound. - He was telling the truth. I'm leaving. - What? How long have you known? - A few months now. - A few months? - Yeah. - But when were you gonna tell me? Wait, don't answer that. If you've known for a few months, then that means you were one of the first people, and if you were one of the first people... Jason, did you request to get sent to Japan? - Yes. - Why would you request to get sent to Japan? You know I can't go with you. Because I was upset. Upset about what? - I was upset with the way you were flirting with Marcus. So the first thing I did was, I marched straight on into my lieutenant, and I told him, "Hey, man, ship me off". "I'm pissed." - Jason, you sound crazy. - I'm trying to get away- That's just what it. - Guys are always gonna flirt with me. It's always gonna be perceived. Like it's... Jason, do you wanna marry me? Was all this just- I do want to marry you. That wasn't a lie. - Shut up! Shut up. The Christmas list, all of that was just an attempt to cover your lie, so people wouldn't find out. You never cared about me. You used my dead sister against me, Jason. - I would never do that. - You did that! But don't worry about it, Jason. Go ahead and pack your bags and go off to Japan, 'cause I promise you, you are not the last man that can get whipped by this. - Hi, mom. I was just calling to say Merry Christmas. Thank you. So I was thinking, maybe the family could get together for New Year's, since we haven't seen each other in a while? You would love that? Me too. I know we haven't seen each other in a long time. We don't get together very much. Oh, I didn't ask, because you didn't ask. Okay. Sounds good. I love you. Bye. - I feel you, Cuz, man. Like, I know what you're goin' through, Cuz. I go through it with my old ladies all the time, man. But to be honest with you, Cuz, when you got a frigerator this empty, man, I don't know if no woman wanna marry ya, man. What is this right here? You got Fula water. Come on, Cuz. You ain't even got no Kool-Aid. - Hold up! Are you in my house? - Hey, Cuz, you worryin' about the wrong thing, man. What you need to be worryin' about, man, is how to get your old lady to marry ya, man. Can you give me real advise? - Listen, Cuz. I told you, man. Just tell her you got the COVID, man. My folks, they quarantinin' right now, man. I made one phone call. - Earl, Earl, Earl! - I can get 'em to call for ya, man. - Stop! You need to learn how to love a woman before you can tell someone else! - "Love a a woman", what you mean, Cuz? I ain't gotta love no woman, Cuz. All the honeys love me, man. 2 Easy Dollars, holler at 'em. You've been the same guy for years! You haven't grown a bit. - What you mean, I ain't goin' nowhere, man? You must of ain't heard my new mix tape, man, no brakes, no airbags, while you're 17, man. Fire, man. Fire, man. I'm saying, grow up, Earl! Take care of your kids. All of them! You made them! Get you driver's license legal again. Get those warrants- - What, Cuz? Get insurance on your car. - So that's how you feel, man? Please get rid of that shoe box and get a bank account. Peace. I know. I know, baby girl. The best advise I can give you is, I know for sure that man loves you. - How do you know if someone loves you? This man ran around this town doing everything he could do to make you happy so you wouldn't leave him. Now, yes, the way he went about it was stupid, but it was still love. - Yeah. But dad, love is not enough. True love is enough. - I mean, you and mom have true love. What's love? Dad, I don't even know anymore. Love is buying your mom what she needs, even when she gets on my nerves. Love is watching a TV show I hate, because I like how it puts a smile on your mom's face. True love is working overtime for an entire year straight to get a house I don't like, but I know your mother does. I do it because I love her. Love is sacrifice, not control, or letting people run over you, but sacrifice. - Carla, listen. First of all, I just wanna say, thank you. Thank you for every bit of joy that you've given me. I know I just made a complete mess out of these last couple days, and I apologize. Carla, you are God's gift to this world, and I just want you to know that. I wanna marry you. I'm gonna marry you, but I want it to be... I want it to be right. And I apologize for all of this mess. And if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and please, please just say yes. I love you. - Yes. Babe, what are you doin' here? - Making a sacrifice. Huh? - Jason, I've come to get my man back. - Babe, what you doin'? Get up! Get up! You are my queen, and queens don't bow to anybody. I love you, and I apologize for all this mess. What I do know is, I need you in my life. You are God's gift. Carla Renee Parker... Let me do this right. Carla Renee Parker, I don't wanna take another step without you by my side forever. I love you. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes, I will. - Ah, man. What time is it? - A little after- - Okay, we gotta go. We gotta get to the Justice of Peace, or else we're gonna have a Zoom relationship. Okay? - Okay. - Come on! - Hey, babe. - Hey. - That's everything. Keys are turned in. - Okay. - Apartments checked out. - All right. - Storage is handled. - Okay. - Can you think of anything else? - It looks like we got everything. - Mm-mmm, the passports? - Yeah, I got 'em. - Okay. Wallets? - Got it. - Carry-ons? - In the trunk. I think that's everything. It is. You seem so - Nervous? - nervous. Yeah. - Very nervous. Yes. - It's okay. It's okay. It's a new start for us. We'll be fine. - Chrissy would be very proud. - She would. And please make sure we have tickets purchased for next year. I do not want your parents flippin' on us. - I'll take care of all of that as soon as we land. Okay? - All right. Okay. - We're goin' to Japan! - Let's go. - I love you. - I love you too. Let's go. Hold on. - Is everything okay? - It's your dad. We'll take it in the car. All right. Jason, listen. I still don't like you! But you're a good man. So you better take care of my daughter while you're out there in Japan. 'Cause if not, I'm gonna come fly out there! Ouch! Would you stop hittin' me? No, I'm gonna let him know! I'm lettin' him know! Better listen, boy! You better take care of my daughter, or I'm gonna come fly out there, and if I do, I promise you it's not gonna be pretty! - Carl, leave the boy alone. Listen! Stop! Listen! Y'all be safe. Have a safe flight. When y'all get out there, let me know. God bless you. We miss y'all and we love you. All right. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
