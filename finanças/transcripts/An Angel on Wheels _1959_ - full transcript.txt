That's what she is. And her story. And mine, which worried me sick. I'll tell you it, because the same could happen to you, my friend. When love's involved, the borders between heaven and earth get blurred. You meet a girl and then you're no longer on earth. You call her: My angel, Baby angel, my beloved angel. It's a question of spirit. We're convinced, ladies, that you're all angels. Men have never doubted that. And especially in my case ... How this adorable creature wanted to prove this to me, almost borders on the unbelievable. I don't wish to influence you. Please judge for yourself. A sweet? -Thanks a lot. A sweet, please? Do you want anything? - No,thanks. A sweet? A sweet? - Thanks. Did he say anything to you? He didn't even notice me. - He's not the only man in the world. Announce our arrival. Your attention please!, we will be landing very shortly in Nice. Please fasten your seatbelts and refrain from smoking. Pierre Chaillot! Will he become World Champion for the 3rd time?! That's the question on everyone's lips here at the racetrack. Surely nobody can take this victory from him. Only 20 more Metres! Yes!!, he did it! Chaillot is yet again Formula 1 World Champion. Here comes the race management and his construction team. The crown of victory around his neck. But even sweeter than victory is a kiss from his bride, Princess Augusta di Tamigo. The car has just arrived. You're crying again. Why can't you be reasonable? What's up? Why the long face! Toothache again? - Toothache. Have you forgotten what it's like to be in love? - In love. With someone you've seen 3 times and doesn't even know you exist The more irrational love is, the more painful. Here. Pierre Chaillot will marry Prinzessin Augusta today. Will the wedding just before the race agree with the race favourite? Why? -Maybe he'll fall asleep at the wheel tomorrow. After the night ... He'll be very relaxed. Punctuality is the courtesy of Kings. Not of Princesses. You're asking a lot of a woman. My heart belongs to another. My Princess. Through the window! What a scandal! That's not ... That's just not possible! Where was everybody?! - The princess sent us out. You left her alone? - It's our job to obey orders. ♪♪ This house 'm the only one you need to obey! - Yes, Madame. Tell the cook to send back the champagne. Everything else goes in the fridge We'll eat salmon sandwiches for the next month. One moment, please. A photo,please! Pierre! Pierre! Wait for me! Where are you going? - To the airport! To fetch my bride! - Why the airport? - She's planning to fly away! With a renowned tenor! Love at first sight! Do you understand?! - No. Angel Starline, would passengers please proceed ... Just a few words for the passengers. The situation is very delicate. Explain it. - We love each other. That's all I can say. If you allow me, I'll try to sing it. Wonderful. - I hope you like it We thank you, Maestro, on behalf of your countless admirers. The couple proceeds to the helicopter ... - Please, darling, get in. The door closes. - Gentlemen. Goodbye. - Have a good flight! Goodbye. Don't move! You can't enter here! - My bride is flying from here! Let him through. You can't interfere with love! Augusta! - You're under arrest! Augusta! What are you doing? - Yes, but ... What did he do?They're arresting him. - Come on, let's take off. Violation of transport security rules! And of airport regulations! Slander! And there is no justification?! Sorry. He will give you a formal apology. Are you his father? - He's my best driver! Hold him here, if I lose the race I won't be able to send the car into production. That doesn't interest me whatsoever. He's staying here! This is love ! What would you do if your wife ran away with another man. My wife?! With another man? 1? I would play a game of billiards. Do you play Billiards? - Why Billiards? I'm sorry. No. I'll pay for everything. The plane,the staff. The fine! Everything! Let's see what I can do. How long has he been married? She left 5 Minutes before the wedding. If Minutes ! He's no jailbird ... How wonderful. Here he comes! Do you hear him! - You bet! He always makes so much noise, that the house almost collapses! Please. - Where are we? At the "Clever Rooster Hotel ". - Clever name for a hotel. Clever, like it's guests. Come on, darling. What are you waiting for ?! Bring the drinks to room 8, and the flowers to 9. I'll go. - This time it's a princess. Wish I were a famous tenor. Hello, Oscar! - Hello! Welcome! Welcome! Good Afternoon.- I'm honoured. -The most discrete Oscar in the world. Princess, what an honour for our modest establishment. I have reserved rooms 8 und 9. As usual. 2 rooms, as always? - Yes. A working room with piano. A bedroom. That's the way my profession is. Artists lead a tough life. Nobody loves me. Nobody. Although she swore that she loved me. Why didn't you choose someone else? Her for example. - I don't want anyone else. Take a look at her at least. Why? - Because she's pretty. I don't think so. - Because you don't want to think so. Look how well-behaved she is. Because she's made of plaster! She's only well-behaved, because she can't escape. Otherwise, she'd be gone. With a famous tenor. Pierre, look. - What? Did she not just have a skirt on? - A skirt? Why would anyone dress a wax figure in a skirt? So that the poor little wax figure doesn't freeze. That's strange! She had a jacket on just a moment ago. Possibly. But she no longer has one on. We're drunk. - Do you really think so? Oh yes!. We're definitely drunk. Sure! We're drunk, plastered. - Go to bed, my friend. So that you're fresh for the trials tomorrow- I don't want to be fresh. I don't care about the race. - She's pretty,isn't she? Marry her. - Miss, excuse me. My friend here is lovesick. Back in a minute. There are so many other beautiful girls in the world. Go back to your doll. - No way. The boss said: Don't leave him alone! In case he does something stupid. - What do you mean? I don't know. But I'm staying here. Come on. Let's have a last drink. No water. It's not good for your spiritual balance. One glass for you and one for your dear friend. Get out of here! - No, I'm not leaving here. Never. - I want to be alone I'm sleeping here. The boss said, not to leave you. I'll sleep here, you can sleep there. The boss said: Don't leave him alone. Did the boss say. Not to leave, the boss said ... My beloved. My true love ... Augusta, ... When you read these lines, I will no longer be among the living. I'm dying of a love, which is killing me. Pierre. Goodbye. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Who are you? - Your guardian angel. Who? - You understood correctly. Your guardian angel. And your mind is much too sombre at the moment. I beg your pardon? I've been assigned to protect you since the 2nd of July 1922. That's your date of birth. Give me the Revolver. - Listen, Miss. Your jokes are funny, but I'm not in a laughing mood. Go to bed. - You don't believe me. If you're an angel, then I'm Santa Claus. You're a famous racing driver. And you can be proud of that. But today you're confused like a young schoolboy in love. I'm just doing my job. - And you just walk into stranger's rooms at night ?! Just imagine, If I had only had a shirt on? Would it have disturbed you? Not me. I know you inside-out. You've got a scar here. Your child-nurse burnt you there, when she was doing your curls. Your hair was this length. You were 3 at the time and you were a very cute kid. A charming, bold little boy. Your first date behind the small church.. You were 15. She didn't turn up. You cried. Suddenly a small girl arrived, smiled at you and gave you a present of a flower. Yes, a Marguerite. Then she disappeared. You tried to run after her, but she was no longer there. And this girl, that was ... Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Michel, please. Just for a moment. Tell me what you see over there? - Where? In the other room? - In the other room? - Yes. I don't see anything. Exactly, nothing. How many fingers do you see? - Four? Five? Six. Completely plastered. I would call the porter and tell him, Your guardian angel is here. And he should take a good look at him. Then he'll call a doctor, because he won't believe you. Nobody will believe you. Because it's not believable. - And I'm supposed to believe you? If you're my guardian angel, why didn't you me guard me?! What happened today, is all thanks to me. And you call yourself a guardian angel. An angel that sends me to prison. And sabotages my happiness. - Your happiness doesn't interest me. What are you interested in then? Your soul. It's my job to guard your soul. Even if it means sacrificing a broken neck or a broken heart. You've got views ... - The body is mortal. A small kid like you doesn't think about such things. - I'm not a small kid! I remember you, when you were so tiny. - Ridiculous! Don't be nervous. - To save my soul, you prevented the wedding? Right. - And why? If you really want to know ... But you've had a pretty hard day. You must be actually very tired. Tired? I'm not tired at all. Why should I be ... - Yes, you are .You are tired. Very tired. Pardon. - You see how good I know you? Come on. Lie down. - Yes, I feel tired now. Don't be embarrassed in front of me. I've seen you fall asleep so often. An angel in my room. I could never have even dreamt it up. You weren't supposed to see me. They forced me, with that thing. I shouldn't have taken the figure's clothes either. I had to look like a girl. A girl, who loves you. Your soul can't die because of a woman, who doesn't love you. She did love me. She loved me. Are you sleeping. Stop thinking about this woman. She doesn't love you. You have to forget her. Are you asleep. Sleep ... That is absolutely unbearable! He's been singing non-stop since early morning. Oscar, where are you?! - Don't upset yourself. It's bad for the liver. What?! I'm a paying guest! I can get upset, whenever it suits me! I'm not getting on anyone's nerves! - Do you really think so? Oscar, get him to shut up. Nobody could put up with that! You're aware of our establishment's policy. The guest is always right, even if he sings. Artists require tolerance. His girlfriend also has to practise some patience. He's got a girl with him? - And you? That's his bride. A princess. A real one. A real princess?! The missing bride. I can't believe my eyes. Put your glasses on. Looks more intelligent. I've been waiting ages. - I had problems with the high C. With what? - Don't you hear it? Do you hear it? Does it sound bad? I don't think so. I don't know much about it. I've caught a slight cold. But,don't worry. Smile, my child. You're so beautiful when you smile. Very interesting! - I don't profit from the love affairs of others. Be quiet. There are some people who would be very interested to hear this. E.g. the Princess' fiancé. Connect me to Monte Carlo. Hotel de Paris.Pierre Chaillot please. Don't mention my name. Hurry up. I'm sorry. But business is business. Michel! Did you sleep well? Have you seen her? -Who? - The girl. Which girl? - The girl from tonight. You couldn't possibly understand it.. Maybe I just dreamt it. I have to know, if she was really there? - Who was there? Oh, the revolver! What about the revolver? Have you got it? - What would I be doing with it? So it is true. She was there. She's got it. - What has she got? And who is "she"? And that? What is it? A feather. - But what kind of feather! From a bird. - And if it were from an angel? Ha!, from an angel ... You think I'm crazy, don't you? - More a case of too much stress. I've got a surprise. It should interest you. What is it? - There's a beautiful woman sitting here. Your bride. What? - In the "Clever Rooster Hotel" with a tenor. - What?! Congratulations! So ... What? "The Clever Rooster". - Another bird? It's the name of a hotel for love-doves. They stayed there. I'm the cuckold from the "Clever Rooster"! What are you? - I've been cheated on! I'm going to make minced meat out of that choirboy! Where are you going? Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! It's not for your eyes. He's going to make minced meat? Out of a tenor, minced meat ... You again? - It's your own fault. As soon as you're left alone, you immediately get up to no good. It's none of your business. What are you doing here? I'm responsible for you. - I've had enough of your frolics. I was drunk tonight. You won't fool me in the daytime. What can I do, so that you finally believe me? Nothing! Just leave me alone for once! Would a miracle convince you? A miracle? For what reason? When the next car comes, I'll give a sign and the car will fly away. It will fly away. Why? - just so... As a miracle. Idiotic. Cars are there to be driven, not to be flown, there. Let me get by! Just give me this one chance. Listen, there's another one coming. I'll count to three. You'll witness the rest with your own eyes. One, two, three. Bravo. - Are you crazy? What are you doing?! I'm sorry. I didn't realise it was you. He's a tough nut. I tried to convince him. That's enough! Since yesterday you've been acting like an idiot! Who are you? - I didn't come here to explain our hierarchy to you. I'd be wasting your time. You wouldn't understand it. What was your rank in the army? - Captain. Then you have to obey the Colonel. With us, it's no different. With us? Who's "us"? Where are you from? - From far away. The way you look, I knew you were special. You don't understand it's all a bit over your head. We are, who we are. So come on! Get in. You know what he's up to, don't you? - Of course I do. When you hurt someone like his masculine vanity, you're helpless. The will of a human is free. But it's got more to do with you. What kind of a Masquerade is this? That's her uniform. - Who ist "her"? A small girl, who really loves him. A stewardess. So I took on her guise. So that he sees her and feels that she's lovable. You want to seduce him with earthly charms? How could you think such a thing of me? I want him to notice me To get to know me. I mean, the girl, who loves him. I've got to help him. Great. It can't get any worse than it is. So you're in favour? - Not so fast. Did you know that you're in great danger when you're a human? What? - Yes! Worries, diseases, you can catch a cold. If you're unlucky, a toothache! Toothaches are good, if it helps 2 people to come together, who were made for each other. - Good, I'll let you get back to him. Although it doesn't comply with the rules But only for 24 hours. No longer! I can't take care of you for ever. Thanks. May I go now? - Wait a moment! One, two, three ... No! You can't do any more miracles. Humans use their legs for mobility. Run, if you want to catch him. I won't catch up on him that way. - I'll help you then a last time. What about a break-down? That's probably the best at the moment. One,two, Three! His engine won't stir until you've caught up. Go! Is something wrong? Can I help you? Do you know anything about cars? - Not a lot actually, but ... What's that button for? - To start it. - May I press it? Thanks a lot. - you're welcome. I'm just doing my duty. Could you give me a lift? Where to? - I don't know. It depends where you're driving to. I can spend 24 hours with you. What?! - Do you mind? You want me to have you on my back for 24 hours?! I'm just doing my duty. -Then do it! Get in! Lets see how long your nerves can put up with this.I'm a racing driver. You're an angel, aren't you? Some kind of spirit. Yes. - And spirits have no fear. Fear? What's that? We'll soon find out. Don't drive so fast, please! Not so fast! No! Please, not so fast! Don't! No! Not so fast! Not so fast! Hey, Miss. Miss Angel! What's wrong? What ... Quick, Water! - Water! Water! The poor lady. Look how bad she looks. Miserable and pale. She fainted. - Maybe it was a stork. When I had my first kid ... - Look, he's getting red. Is she your wife? - No, my angel. His angel. Great to be so in love. Where am I? - On earth. What happened to me? You were just a bit frightened. - Really. I was scared. And now ... I feel so strange. As if ... I can't say what ... Is it your heart? - No, here. There, is a very strange place.- A sign, that she's maybe in the family way. Don't say things like that to her. She's probably just hungry. Hungry? - Maybe she hasn't eaten for a long time. Maybe it's really only Hunger. Can I get something to eat? Of course. Where could I eat here? There's a restaurant around the curve. That's great. - Thanks. Goodbye. They're both so happy. Isn't it beautiful to be in love. - You bet. Just like us. Do you remember.On that Sunday. I looked at you, you looked at me. - We looked at each other ... And that's the result.. Gone without a trace. How do you explain that, Your highness? It's very simple. Love is poison to all men. If they're unhappy, they go crazy. If they're happy, they cab achieve it. No time for philosophy. It's time to take some action. Who's stopping you? - I alone am powerless. Only you can help! Order your niece to return and marry Pierre! And if she doesn't behave, what ... - You're forgetting yourself! Without this maniac I'm ruined! I could shoot myself. - That would be a solution. What?! - Don't disturb me, I have an idea. What is it? - I think I've got a great idea. Hotel de Paris. The porter, please. Take a message for Pierre Chaillot ? Write: My beloved ... "My beloved" is always a good start. I had to leave you against my will. I still love you. I'll be there soon to explain everything to you. Drive the race of your life. Thousands of tender kisses, Signed: Augusta. Why Augusta? - Augusta, of course. Augusta. Thanks. - You're welcome. And you think, that he'll believe that? - A man in-love believes everything. When he finds out the truth -He'll have won the race and you will have the contract. And afterwards? At least he was happy for 24 hours. I wish I could say that. So, what would you like to eat? I don't know. I have never ever eaten anything. Never? - No, never. Then we'll have to start you off like a baby. - Have you decided? Give her an orange juice and a portion of dried milk. I know what. I'd like some caviar und peach Melba. And you, Sir? - Nothing, The heavens are looking after me. The wine menu. - A glass of water! What's up? Should I not eat that? An angel who loves caviar and peach Melba, is that not too earthly? Is that not good? - It is. But how do you know about that? I suppose. The last person I guarded, an English woman,always ordered it. Why are you not eating? - I have no appetite. Because you're unhappy. - Yes! - Because your woman left you.- Yes! At the moment there are a billion, 566 million, 738 thousand and 200 women in the world. Now there are even 10 more. 500! Even more! - No. There's only one. And I lost her. One among billions! - Yes, only one. I don't get it. You just have to look for another one. Just take a look around. Or take a look at me. You? - Yes. I mean, the way I am ... Do you like that? Not bad. Maybe a little too thin. You don't like her? - Who then? The girl, whose guise I took on. - I beg of you! Leave me alone with all these angel stories. - What am I doing here at all?! I ask myself the same! I've got it You had a bet with some friends, that you would meet me. You won! I have no friends. - So? But you're not in love with me? - No. - Lucky me. I mean, ... I can't exactly answer your question. It would be a lie. -I don't get it. Just try to believe. Not to understand. That you're a ... - Yes, and that everything I say and do, is for your own good. Is that so difficult? - It's impossible. My superiors were right. That's a pity. Where are you going? - I won't be able to help you. I should have stayed invisible. So I should go now. - Wait! Please sit down. I'd love to believe you, but you've got to help me. If I asked you to get rid of a car for me, it would be asking too much. But this small thing here, you could? I couldn't do it. I'm not allowed to. Then get lost. - That's easy. - I thought. But to disappear is not a miracle, the miracle is that I'm here! If I go, I'll never come back. You admit, that you can't prove to me... - I'd love to, but what? That means, wait ... Maybe I could satisfy you with some witnesses ... What kind of witnesses? - I have friends everywhere, who know me very well. They know, who I am. Who for example... Like her there. - You can't use that as a witness. That's a bird. - And that one? Doves are always in twos. That's proverbial. And that one? - Purely coincidental. And her? Is that also a coincidence? Sweet, what a coincidence, or is it? Pierre! What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? You can see for yourself. I'm training doves? And you? Pardon, Miss. Would you not like to introduce me? Michel Marrot, my friend and mechanic. I know you. - Me? - Yes. You're a very nice boy. - Thanks a lot. What are you doing here? -I was lucky enough to see your car. What I've brought you, you don't deserve. A message from her. I'll leave the engine on and wait for you. - Back in a minute. Here, read it. She loves me. -That's not true! She doesn't love you! - No, no. You're a perfect angel, but you know nothing about earthly love. Goodbye. Or better said, adieu. What's wrong now? - I've got a pain here! Open your mouth! A bad tooth! - What? That's from all the sweet things. That's not true. - Anyway, come on with me! Where to? - To a dentist.You're supposed to be looking after me! Go! Pierre, where to? - What do you think! To the dentist! - Why? Why, why! - Pierre! Pierre! What a madman!. Where are you going? -I'm going. I can't feel anything anymore. Don't forget: Come back tomorrow. Next, please! I'm afraid. - Be brave. - Well, please! Come on in! Don't waste time. We're short of it. Here are even more patients. Pierre! Please don't leave me alone. Please come in. Sit down please. - Sit down over there. Don't worry. The doctor isn't evil. He only wants to help you. The young lady is nervous, isn't she? - Be careful, she's very fragile. We all are. A tooth is no big deal and a dentist is not a hangman. So lets move up a little towards heaven. So now open up your sweet little mouth. So let's take a little look. Where's the evil trouble maker? There! - Watch what you're doing! She's an incredibly delicate and small person. Me too. I'm also actually very gentle. We'll soon find out. Mouth open. Open your mouth! Why won't you open your mouth? - Open it. It won't hurt. I am here. - Open up. You can hear me, we're by your side. We'll open it, won't we?. So let's open up your mouth. Yes! That's great. And you are her husband, aren't you? No, I, I... I'm her guardian angel. Guardian angel, that's a good one. Very funny First we'll do a temporary filling and tomorrow we'll do the inlay. Tomorrow ... - Tomorrow. Where will you be tomorrow? - I won't be here anymore. Are you going to leave me? - You know, I've only got 24 hours. And not a minute longer. - Will you miss it here? I don't know. It's not easy, here on earth. You've got hunger and pain. Fear. And you get sad. Why? - I don't know. I've never been sad. - You have no reason to be. Me all the more. If that was really the truth! - What? - Everything. A girl. Like all the others. Could you not love her? Look? A hand like that for example. Isn't it pretty? Or such a mouth. Those eyes. Don't you like it? Why are you telling me this? You're just about to leave me. If I promise, that you'll see me again? And just for a few hours again? - As long as you want. I don't need to believe in angels. - Only, if you talk about us. We often say "my angel” to those who we love. If I only knew, why you made up the story with the angel ... You forced me. What you now like you weren't aware of before. I never saw you before! - Oh you did. Often. Up above, in planes. But you were always busy with other things. With a neighbour. Or with a newspaper. I never noticed you. Only men can be so dumb. I'm not angry with you, I only want you to be happy. You say that in such a sad way, as if you are angry with me. No, I'm not sad. I don't want to be sad. I want to be happy. Help me achieve it. I want to dance and drink champagne. I want to be happy for once. Like everyone. Isn't it true? Do you know what you are? - What? You're an angel. Come on. Take a seat, your highness. You reserved the best table. I'm aware of your fondness for bikinis. One more. - That's really nice for the first time. Don't worry, you won't get tipsy from it? I've never been tipsy. You've got strict regulations in the air. You make it tough on yourselves. No alcohol, no adventurousness. You shouldn't marry, is that true? Yes. - I understand now why you always talk about angels. Because you're a mechanical angel. Be watchful of our safety up there until we've landed. When they've finished working, they disappear. No chance to thank them. - It's the same with real angels. As soon as the protected one is in safety, they disappear. Just look how I'm being protected? A woman, who really loves you. Interesting. - She really looks after you. Every day, every hour, every minute. If you're sick, she'll nurse you.If you're in grief, she'll take you in her arms. When you go to work, she makes sure that nothing happens to you. And tries to block everything bad and evil from reaching you. A guardian angel is then superfluous. Understand? - No. Everyone who is absolutely loved doesn't need a guardian angel. What happens then to these poor, unemployed guardian angels? -Them? They get reassigned,and guard a new person in need.Someone desperate. Who enters this world. To find love. Tough profession.They're not to be envied. - You're right. Give me another drink.- No. I want to forget everything. Let's dance. Come on. From now on I'll guard you and you guard me if you want. That's what I'm doing the whole time. That means taking on a major responsibility for me. It's not easy to protect someone who lives between heaven and earth. Do you think, it's easier for me to look after a man who doesn't whizz around at speeds of over 200 km/h. That's my profession. That's the way it is. I have to win in order to live. - Couldn't you change your profession? I could never do that and for nobody in the world. Not even for the girl, who loves you? Do you believe she really loves me? Yes, she really loves you. Does the lady have a request? - I don't wish anything. I'm perfectly happy. - Sorry. This table is for our guests. I'm on duty here. - Oh really. You must be looking after a sick person. - A very sick one. Augusta, where were you? -They said in the castle,you were here. Where have you been since yesterday? - On a mystery tour. That's what you call it? That's repulsive. Actually rather strange. Fortunately I found an escort. Do you know Henric Tennson? A famous Tennis champion. He just won at Wimbledon. Take a seat. What about playing a few sets in Biarritz? I don't understand you. - Biarritz! Tennis! A cigarette maybe? - I don't smoke. Sorry. A Champagne? - I don't drink. He understands nothing, he doesn't smoke or drink? - He's world famous. What about the famous tenor? - It was an error. Was Pierre very broken-hearted? - What you put the poor man through, that was atrocious. You put his heart on a skewer. Men are so sensitive. You've got to be very careful with them. That's safe to say. - Why? Unbelievable. I left him, I thought he would die, and he's dancing. That's a hard one to swallow! Ladies and Gentlemen. Tonight's main attraction. The magician Koh-i-Noor. Up until recently he lived as a recluse in a monastery in the Himalayas. He will display the power of his mind by making a human disappear from the face of the earth. Please! What's he going to do? - Make a spectator disappear. Have you never seen the trick? - A Trick? A standard one. Pretty much an everyday miracle. You can witness it for yourself. The Master speaks only Tibetan. I will translate. He would like to have a volunteer from the audience to come on stage. It's not dangerous at all. The Master says, it's completely safe. There's no risk involved. A human who can perform a miracle. Unbelievable. He does it every day. - I want to see that. - You can't do that. I have to know how he does it. Here comes a lady volunteer. Straight from the clouds. Just off a plane. Step closer. A charming, little stewardess. Go into the tent please. I hope, you're not afraid of a miracle. You don't have any fear? - Fear? I don't believe in it. You'll see it. Everyone will see it. A terrific sensation. Sit down on the golden armchair and try to concentrate. The Master will release you now from the pull of the earth. Concentrate please. Concentrate. With magnetic force he will free her from the earth's gravity. He is pulling her upwards. You feel yourself lighter. You are released. What will now happen before your eyes, is unique. By means of the master's powers, a human can be disintegrated. One disappears. You're feeling very light. Can you feel it? - I don't feel anything. Am I disturbing ? -You?! I'll explain it to you later. Sit down. - What's up with you? He wants to make you disappear. It's a Trick, but it's making me nervous. My poor friend. I fear, you're losing your mind. - Possibly. What are you going to do? -I have to ... Concentrate. As soon as the red curtain closes, you will have disappeared. I'll count to three. One ... Where is she? What happened? That's a very fine trick. Where's the little one. She was so nice! It was like always. Now she is gone. I don't know that trick. Don't be so childish. - You see, she's not there anymore. Fakir from the Himalayas! - That's not his name! Where's the girl? She can't have flown away. Is there a trap-door here? - No. - Bring her back. Immediately! We're not really magicians after all. I'm going to kill you ... Where is she really? - You asked for me? Does that surprise you? - I didn't do anything evil. I didn't get up to anything. - You were drinking Champagne and dancing. But above all I saw your eyes and his eyes. Are you trying to say, you're purely doing your duty? He has to fall in love. - Do you know what you're saying?! - Yes. Exactly. And I think I've achieved it. He likes me. I mean, the other one. Then get the girl over here! Impossible! She won't be back from work until tomorrow. Then wait until tomorrow. - If I leave him alone,the other one will destroy it all. I have to protect him. - Who can protect you from the devil? I fear, he likes his little stewardess a bit too much. Know what I mean? Just trust me. - You don't make it easy for me. But, come on. I'm not obstructing anyone from doing their duties. Stay until the other one comes. But not a minute longer! Go! Your friend again. - Yes, a little scuffle, you know. Because of his bride? - No, because of another. Is she gone too? - Yeah, by plane. He loves flying petticoats. - You've seen through him. I see through everyone. And that's why your friend is staying here in prison. But Superintendent, the race is tomorrow. Let him out! I can't do anything. He caused a lot of trouble, he tore up the fakir's turban, ran away without paying, ... I can't do anything more for him. Is that your last word, Superintendent? What do you want from me? Superintendent.How the case may be, how much do you want...? What are you doing here? It might surprise you. We got engaged I know. - Oh, he told you about me? Yes. - I fear, not a lot of good things. He has no reason to. - What right have you got to be here? What right have you got to ask? - You don't love him. And you? -1...? I have to love him. I'm his guardian angel. It's a nice concept. But not very original. We are all their guardian angels. What would happen to men, if we didn't look after them. I only want him to be really happy. How charming. How do you plan to contribute? With something,which you can't. A little love. - Great. That's not a lot, is it? Not a lot? - Yes. When I look at you. A lifeless creature. To give men the illusion of happiness, the heart and the soul are not the decisive factors. Believe me, that makes the biggest impression. Sure, you are a beautiful woman. But what makes a woman beautiful? 60 litres of Water, some carbon and calcium, then mixed to form a body. And you're so proud of that? He doesn't think about dust and water, when he holds me in his arms.. In his arms? That's what they're there for ... Did he never try that out with you? You are the devil. - Thanks a lot. Good that you came. We were just talking good about you. I was really worried about you. Worried about me? - Yes, I was afraid of losing you. Pierre, it's time for the young woman to go to bed. Good night, Augusta. Moving. Really moving. Good night, Pierre. I wish you a good night with your charming guardian angel. Guardian angel? She said herself that all woman are angels. Where were you? - I'm back again. You can see me with your own eyes. Is that not enough? - You're right. The main thing is, you're here again. Sometimes you can be very reasonable. Believe me, it's not easy to look after you. You're a tough one. So? Is it really so tough with me? Really? - You've got to accept humans the way they are. What's up with you? Are you tired? I don't know. It's the champagne. Does it make you so tired? - Do you want to take a short rest? Life is so exhausting. Yes, come on. I told you: You have to be careful with champagne. But you didn't want to believe me. You are so good to me. I always knew you're a good person. Stop thinking. Be good and go to sleep. Sleep? - and dream that everything's true. Everything's true ? - Dream and reality, that's what life is about. And now go to sleep. Go to sleep. Why are you looking at me like that? - Are you not sleeping? You're looking at my mouth. How do you know that? - I can feel it. How can you feel it? Because I love you. Even if it's a dream I still love you. You unfortunate! You're standing on the threshold to hell! How did you get here? What are you doing here? - That's my business. I don't want to lose an angel, just because you're looking for pleasure! Get out! Please stay. - What are you waiting for?! Why are you not sleeping? - Did you see her? - Who are you looking for? She! She's gone again. - Oh, you mean ... Did she turn up again? Idiot, she was just there. Now she's gone again! - Where's she gone? A woman comes and says, she's your guardian angel. What would you do? Nothing. - What should I do? First she's gone and then she's back again. How can you explain something like that. - That's impossible. Angels don't exist. You would be the first person, ever to have seen one. What did he want? - To prevent me from marrying Augusta. Not a bad idea at all. You're right. She wanted to prevent me from ... We'll find out soon. What will he do? - Doesn't matter. What would have happened, if I hadn't come at the right time! I warned you. Everything you did for him was in vain. In vain? - He's back where he started. Listen to what he says to the others. Augusta, I love you. And we'll get married after the race. Great, marriage. Which girl? What a guardian angel? I haven't got one. Inform the radio and the press. They should know how happy we are. Yes, everyone. I want to. I love you. Everyone should know about it. That's complete madness ... That's the last chance I'm going to give her. - Augusta? I mean the little one. Get up, I need the armchair. Why do you want the poor little armchair? It's her armchair! That's where she sat for the first time! So what? - If she is, what she claims to be, she'll appear again. You believe in miracles? - I don't, but she does. If she doesn't turn up again. - Then she was only a fraud. I'll count to three. One, two, three! - No. Hey, do you see anybody in the armchair over there? No, I don't see anyone. No. Please, Miss Angel. That's the way you want it to be. No! No, no, no and no! That's all I need! Here and there and back there! Princess, I insure you ... - No but. It's tight here at the back! But you couldn't have gotten fatter in the last 2 days. Come in. The musicians are here. - Is the staff already here? They're eating. - Make sure that the champagne stays there! 15 bottles went missing 2 days ago, although there was no wedding! There'll be no wedding today either. Not in that dress! You're marrying! In blue jeans, in a bikini, in a potato sack if it has to be! I'm sick of your moods. I want to live my life in peace! Drivers and cars are ready to start ... - The car is in top form! Get the best out of it. - It starts in 5 minutes, he doesn't have an angel! That's his business. - I want to see him. - No! Get the girl, bring her to him. Your last chance. Go. If she sees me, she'll faint. Quite the opposite. If she sees you, she'll recognise herself. She'll know, it's weird or just a bad joke. I'll get the best out of this thing. Nobody will ever have seen a race like it. Bravo. I'll keep my fingers crossed! As long as I'm away, look after him? - At my age? To a racing driver. Are you crazy?! Do you want to risk your life because of that episode. - I'm well-protected. If I have a guardian angel, he should look after me. Let's see, what can be done. We're here. Get out! - Thanks and look after him. O.k..Hurry up, faster. I have no time, to drive a car. It's too late for that. I'll have to take a shortcut across the roofs. Still 5 minutes until it starts. The suspense is mounting. It's just about to start! Now! Start! That's a driver! Angel Starline announces, that flight 912 from Cairo will be delayed by 4 hours. - Thank you. No news from the tower. Their departure was delayed. There's a storm. The connection was suddenly gone. Radio contact has broken down.- But then the plane should have arrived. Maybe the pilot changed course and decided to land in North Africa. When would the plane arrive then? Tomorrow morning or afternoon? Then they're doomed. - Nonsense! They're not doomed! Tell me, is there anybody up there? No, somebody, who is here on earth. Those on the earth, should look after themselves! Chaillot is taking major risks. As if he believed in miracles. He's driving like a dare-devil. We've just gotten his fastest time. Sensational. A 112 km/h lap. He has beaten Partellis time from 1958 by almost 2 km/h. We know why. His bride is waiting at the finishing line, Princess Augusta, whom he will marry after the race. Yes? They've arrived! Pass this message on to the airline! When will you land? - Angel Starline announces the arrival of flight 912 Cairo-Paris in the next few minutes. How long is the stopover? - Like always. - How long then? You must know your airlines schedule! I can't explain it to you. Excuse me! - What a strange thing. Take me to Monte Carlo! -I'm on duty. I can't dodge the fare. - It's a matter of life and death! It's a man, isn't it? - Yes, a man. Do you love him so much? - Yes. - Come on. Don't keep him waiting. Pierre Chaillot, bravo Chaillot! The race is getting better by the minute. Tempers are getting heated like their racing machines. If he really wants to die ... - He doesn't want to die,but to win. Will the car make it? Just the last kilometres to go. He's gone completely mad! - You're not kidding. You know him ? - Unfortunately. He overtakes the Monacan, who's been driving a very tactical race in his private Ferrari. The spectators are thrilled. Everyone's glued to the finishing spurt. I think he'll do it. Don't drive carelessly, Chaillot. With that big, heavy racecar. He's being foolish.He's driving like the devil, Pierre Chaillot! Like the devil! Chaillot sets an incredible pace. It's the final phase of the race. And we're so excited just like the spectators here. He's getting ready to overtake again. That's the English driver. Chaillot is an adorably good driver! The crowd's favourite. The record holder from Monte Carlo. Only 3 more laps. Then the flag. Maestro, when I give you a sign, you can start the music! Then play and stop when I give you a second sign. Don't open the dining hall door until the ceremony is over. Otherwise, the caviar will be all gone. Where's the Lord Mayor? - At the race. - What? He's coming straight here after it. The groom won't be here before him. Last lap. For the last time, they speed through the lanes of Monte Carlos. Just under 3 kilometres to go. Chaillot is still in front. Chaillot has extended his lead. A new lap record! 112,7 Kilometres. That's it! Chaillot has won! Bravo! Bra ...? - Where is she? She was just here ... The other drivers are battling for 2nd, 3rd and 4th place. They're still fighting for positions. For one driver the battle is over. For Pierre Chaillot. He is and remains the champion! Against toughest competition. - You?! I knew you would come back. - We have no time to lose. The plane is about to land! - Quick? Where to? The plane is departing again! - Get in. Lucky I'm a racing driver. Where are we flying to? Don't ask, just drive. - To the end of the world. Strange, a girl has stopped Chaillot on his lap of honour. Who is she? - She is getting in - They're driving away. Where to? The Lord Mayor ... Augusta! Augusta! Drive to the airport! Tell me, who are you ? It's not about me but more about the man you love. It's all settled. He knows you, and loves you too. He will stand soon in front of you and smile at you. Then you will see that he knows you. He knows that you had a toothache yesterday. A toothache ? Yes, that's right. If he mentions strange things to you, about angels or similar things, let him. Men are like that. They regard woman as angels You think he loves me? Attention, Angel Starline announces the departure to Paris. Passengers to Gate A please. A ticket please. Quick! - Where to? Yes, where to? - To Paris. - To Paris. Your name? - Pierre Chaillot. I have to go. They're expecting me. - What's wrong? Why are you suddenly so sad? In a few minutes, we'll fly away and stay together forever. Forever. Do you understand? Where are you going?! - Your ticket! Everything o.k.. Come on. Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! A sweet? A sweet? - Thanks. Would you like something? - I have everything a human could wish. What's wrong, what's wrong? The 24 hours are up! Remember the regulations! Article 2. Angels always smile. Whatever comes your way, whatever happens. - I know. All the better. It's about time. Can you hear it? A new one to guard is waiting for you. - I can hear it. Babies are very impatient. I'm coming. Thank god! This time it's a girl. The end
