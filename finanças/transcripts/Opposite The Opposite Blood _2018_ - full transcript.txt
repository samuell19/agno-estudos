Charlie, from above there appears to be 20 squad cars and at least three ambulances outside the crime scene. Based on an eyewitness report, an unidentified Asian male walked into the club and a fight broke out shortly thereafter. Within minutes, several nightclub patrons inside were shot dead or seriously injured. Jennifer, any report from police on the shooter's motive? There's no official report from police yet, but a source informed HTC7 there have been prior incidents at this club that may be related. However, police have not conclusively determined the shooter's motive. Back to you, Charlie. Thank you, Jennifer. Can someone explain to me what the hell happened last night? He did it again, sir. Well, how many people are dead? Eight dead, nine in critical condition. Detective Murphy, do we have a description on this person? Yes, sir, we do. The description we have from the witness, he's described as Asian male, mid-20's, 150 to 155 pounds, five foot five, to five foot seven with long, dark hair. Well, I want you to find out who this person is, okay? Yes, sir. Chief, the only way we can get him is to find out who he works for. Chief, let's turn the heat up on these guys. What's next, Chief? We need to put out more squads, but we're increase patrols and we're going to assign more officers to the night shift. We have to work smarter if we're gonna find out who this guy is working for. If not, the Feds are gonna step in. Sir, we'll need the city's approval for the budget in order to put more patrol out there. Detective Johnson, I want you to put together a budget plan. I have a meeting with the Mayor this afternoon. I have a feeling this may be linked to the $40 million dollar funding. We can't assume anything until we catch this guy. We all got to do the best we can. I don't wanna lose this case to the Feds. You follow the money, Johnson. Hey, Jimmy, did you hear about some fight at a nightclub? Uh, no, why? I don't know, but cops say that this guy must be highly trained in martial arts or something. Well, this guy might be someone you know or someone from your martial arts school. Yeah, right. Here, read it. I need your help, my friend. I'm short on $34 million dollars. No problem. Dollar. You've got it, my friend. Boss, I failed you. Hello? Uncle! Yeah? Well, dinner's ready! Alright. Tengo? Martial arts school. Deangelo? Mr. James, preparations have been made for the martial arts school. We've got this under control. Okay, you take the mission. What's next? Valentino's night club. It should be ours within days. And Tommy's work, we're cleaning it up. Good. But this one thing, police are on us. Make no mistake. Change plan, there will be a replacement. A replacement? Yes. Mr. James, which one of us would you like us to replace? None of you guys. There will be an outsider. Can we trust him? I trust him! Hello, James, how are you doing? I'm doing good. How are you doing, my friend? Very well, thank you. What brings you today, James? I need one of your specialists. What kind of specialist? A female specialist. Good evening, gentlemen. We're here to see Vinny. Vinny? One second. Here to see Vinny. You're good. Gentlemen, follow me please. What the hell you boys doing in my club? You should already know why. Vinny, if you were doing what you're supposed to be doing we wouldn't be here. What the hell are you talking about? We need you to sign all this, on this, to us, yesterday. I ain't signing shit! Don't even think about it. Tell your men to stop. Stop! You have two choices. This place or your life. Hello, may I help you? Checking in. May I get your first name? Helena. Okay, your last name? Yochevik, Helena Yochevik. Helena. You'll be on floor 25, Room 2505. Enjoy your stay. Hello, what can I do for you? I think you know what you can do for us. Do you speak English? You're late. Oh, you do, you do. Sorry, traffic. Put your gun away. There are too many innocent people here. Don't play games with me. No, I don't. The boss just making sure you get this. I'm looking for a Mr. Chao Yang. I'm sorry, but Mr. Yang passed away last week. Well, that's just too bad now, isn't it? Um, his brother, Pao, will be taking over. Okay, do you know where I can find his brother, Pao? Bar's closed. No, it's not. Who are you? Your time's up! A single shot rang out late last night in this South St. Paul night club and the owner is dead. The back story is that three men and one woman entered this club three nights ago. They asked the owner to sign a document of some kind. He refused and a violent fight took place. Whether or not that fight and last night's shooting are related is yet to be determined. We're gonna talk with some of the detectives here. A source inside the police department is saying they're not related, but we'll find out right now. Detectives, can you tell us anything about the shooting last night and then the fight three nights ago? I can't disclose any information at this time. This is a active crime scene that's still under investigation. I'm sorry. The lead investigator assigned to the case, he'll answer all those questions for you. Who's the lead investigator? Detective Lee. Mr. Pao? Yes. Just relax. Okay, just take it easy on me. I'm back, Mr. Pao. Oh, my God! Mr. Pao! Lady, what lady? Is she black, white, Spanish, American, what? She's white. Well, I'm not sure, I think she's white. Hi, my name is Detective Lee. You are Gina? Tina. Where is your master? Master is not here. Get out of here! We'll be back! Work it, baby, come on, do it. Yes, yes, mm-hmm, yep. There it is, baby, yes, yes. I'm gonna have to get back with you. I have a customer. May I help you, sir? I'm looking for Ricky Jones. And you are? A friend. Ricky's in there. Give that to him, please. Ricky Jones. Man, you back again? Yep. Well, I decided it's not to my best interest to sign that contract. Well, it's not in your best interest to have an option. Fuck you, man! I ain't signing shit! Hey, Ricky! You okay? Yeah everything's good, man. Everything's cool. Oh, man. Playing hard, everything's good. Oh, man. Oh, man. This is some bullshit, man. Mr. James, the men failed to take the school. Damn it! Hello? Sorry. Your stuff? Sorry. Why you following me? See this? Do you see this, Tengo? We got all these. It has been nearly 15 years. This place, the martial arts school, didn't do it. We must take it out or else we're not gonna get the rest of the money. $40 million dollars. We will take over whole town, whole business. Tommy failed. The Feds on my ass. Get it done! Mr. James, I'm gonna take care of this my way and I will get it done. May I help you? Lin Chow? Yes? I have a last assignment for you. Who is the mark? It's Tommy. Don't fail me. It's good to see you, Tommy. I called you here because I wanted to see you. I have one last mission before I have to go. Let me slip into something a bit more comfortable. Is this your last assignment? So he sent you to kill me? I think you already know the answer to that question. Shoot me. Lin Chow, which came from the person that you trusted, has failed. George. Yes, sir. Do we go home now? No, we're not. My whole life I've been trained to shoot and kill and I've never missed a target. But, my last target. Here's your chance. I don't want to take that chance. So now you have become a target of your own. I've already made up my mind. You mean more to me than just a target. I want you to know that I... We don't have to do this. I don't want to waste my bullets. Get him! Lin! Tommy! I love you. I can finally say goodbye. Lin! Lin! What the hell you doing here? Why the hell would you care? Hi, Mr. Ying, how are you feeling today? Good. Good, here's medication. Thank you. Do you have any questions for me? No. Well, just let me know if you do, okay? Okay. Can we go home now? No, we're not. What can I do for you, Mr. James? I have an assignment for you. Anything for you, boss. I'm missing some very important documents from my office. Dr. Chue, my brother, took it. That briefcase right now is worth $40 million dollars. 10 years from now it's $400 million dollars. Yes, Mr. James. You know where to start. Sir. Where's Daddy? Daddy's at home. Is he coming? No, he's not. He asked me to come pick you up. Uncle, I miss my Daddy. I'm sure he misses you, too. Let's go. Hello, James. What do I owe the pleasure of this call? She's gone. Who is gone? Helena. Helena? James, what is next? I need my money. I need another one. No. No more, James. This is second time. Then you will only get half your money. What do you mean half? She failed her assignment. Failed? Helena never fails! She failed her assignment. Do you understand? You. You play dirty tactic. Hmm, you should know by now. You did not protect her, just like in Asia. Don't bring up the past or you won't get your money. I will get it, you know. Then come and get it yourself! I will, my friend. Special Agent Jung and myself have been working undercover. I spoke with Chief David on the phone. He referred you to us about a man by the name of Mr. James? We'd like to meet with him. We suspect he may have something to do with the $40 million dollars in funding from about 15 years ago. Do you know where Mr. James normally hangs around? Well, I've heard a little bit about this guy. I heard he has so much money that he will fly his private jet to Bangkok and come back the next day. Double your payment, the debt is settled. For Helena, it must be paid in blood. Take your money and leave. Hope you enjoyed the little show, James. You son of a bitch! You! The briefcase! Back! Take him out, Tengo. Now. Johnson, how's it coming? Can you shut the door? Lee's going on vacation in the next two weeks, but he called in this morning to take a one day leave. Really? Do we have enough evidence? Oh yeah, we have enough evidence to wrap Lee up. When? Today. FBI Agent Jung, you're under arrest. For what? For the killing of two FBI agents and the assistance of illegal criminal activities. You're gonna have to need more than that to arrest me. Partner, I wouldn't do that! We got everything in our hands, Tengo, all the deeds, all the documents, they all signed. Start to look for a new office. I saw a good space downtown. When can we go see it? I'll see if it's available. What do you think, boss? I like this place, it's good. Then this will soon be our new place of operation. But there is one thing we must do before we proceed. Time is running out. We must get it before it's too late. Don't worry, I will do whatever I can to get this done for you. Good. Where's Lin at? Should be on her way. Bastard, you killed my father! You should see the look on your father's face just before I pulled the trigger. Game's over! Stop, police! Tommy! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop the gun now! Drop the gun! Put it down now! Put your hands in the air! Turn around away from me now! Put your hands up! Johnson, hook 'em up. Don't move, buddy. Take him away. Are you okay? I'm okay.
