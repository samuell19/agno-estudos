You... ...try to protect your children, stay one step ahead. But then something happens, and you realize that all those dangers you've been trying to protect them from are not all out there. By the time you get that, it's too late. (SIREN WAILING) (DOG BARKING) Take it, got it. Yeah. One step here, and two behind you. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) It's okay. It's okay, baby. I'm right here, okay? Okay? OFFICER: Ma'am, hands behind your back, please. Mrs. Cambridge, I'm afraid you'll have to come with us. Sally Cambridge, you're under arrest on suspicion of child abuse and endangerment. You have the right to remain silent... I have to go. I have to ride with him. MAN: She must have done it. WOMAN: She's getting in the car. (SIGHS) OFFICER: Move back, please. Move back. (SIREN WAILING) (DOOR OPENS) Mike! Thank God. I have to get to the hospital. You have to tell them. He wasn't moving! Please, you have to take me. Sally, sit down. It's pretty serious, Sally. He has a head wound, and it's, um, pretty severe. (SIGHS) Listen, maybe you should call your attorney. What? I... I don't understand. Mike, you know me. Why are you keeping me here? Because this wasn't the first instance. It doesn't look good. I would never do anything to hurt my children. Nobody ever intends for things like this to happen. Sometimes it just goes too far, gets out of hand. No! That's not what happened. Then what did? Sally. Tell me. ALL: Happy Birthday! BRAD: Hey, happy birthday. 16, hey, stud! (WRESTLING PLAYFULLY) SALLY: Unless you want me to sing happy birthday, you'd better blow out these candles. BRAD: Let him blow. (BLOWS) BRAD: Whoo, nice bites. Very good! Happy birthday. BRAD: Now, Leo! Now, Leo! (LAUGHING) You wait, squirt. I'm gonna get you. Wait till your birthday. LEO: Oh, yeah, you wait till you holler for Daddy. (GROANS) LEO: Aah! BRAD: Thanks for letting me be part of this, Sally. Guys, it's a quarter of! These new? Yeah. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, here he is! Flying in. Hey, listen, Friday afternoon, I'm gonna be here bright and early to pick you up, buddy boy. LEO: It's not bright and early. That's bright and late, buddy boy. Brains of the family, right here, this one. (CHUCKLES) This one, this one. Hey! (LAUGHS) SALLY: Jack! Excuse me, Gus. (SIGHS) From Marcia and me. Oh, Dad, this is so cool! We can try it out on the weekend if you're not too tired form Friday night. You guys are gonna whip Central Hill! SALLY: Here, sweetheart. Happy birthday. Thanks, Mom. (PAPER RUSTLING) Let's see what we got here. Mom, this... This has, like, everybody, Blind Lemon Jefferson, the Carter Family, Helen Humes. (CHUCKLES) JACK: Thanks. Thanks, you guys. All right, I guess I'd better be moving now. Well, happy birthday, son. Thanks, Dad. Marcia and I will pick you up on Friday, and, uh, hold down the fort. Mom, I can't believe you got me that! (LAUGHING) Hey, Jack, how are you? JACK: Hey, Ms. Hirsch. Doin' okay. SALLY: What, no basketball practice this afternoon? Oh, uh, no, it...it got canceled. Really? Yeah. Oh. Well, don't forget to pick up Leo at 6:00. Uh, actually, that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about, Leo. Mmm-hmm. Mom, uh... BOY: Yo! I'm gonna wait right here for you. All right. Mom, come on, Leo's not a baby anymore, all right? He can stay home for a couple hours by himself. No, he can't! Why not? Because he can't. Well, fine. Then let him stay at Cory's house. Cory's family has plans. And, Jack, I asked you. You said you'd pick him up. It's your responsibility. Look I know I did, Mom. But why does everything have to be my responsibility? Everything is not. He's not my kid! Look, Mom, I'm... Just this one time, all right? I wanted to go and check out this new arcade. I'd be home by 9:00. All right. All right. Thanks, Mom. So I'll see you then. SALLY: Yeah. Wait. What's the deal on no basketball practice two days before a game? Oh, uh, Central Hill canceled. SALLY: They did? Yeah, uh. Something happened. There won't be another game for a couple weeks. SALLY: Coach Young? Hi. Sally Cambridge. Yeah, hi. I wanted to ask you something. I heard the Central Hill game was canceled, but your secretary just now told me that it's not, uh... Is Jack not playing? I see. No, I didn't know. No, of course you have to. I understand. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye. Anything wrong? Oh, everything's fine. Hmm. Yeah. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) I know you know what time it is. Jack, where have you been? Have you been at the mall all this time? Jack! (RAP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR OPENS) Don't you walk away from me like that. Look, Mom, I'm sorry I'm late, all right? Now, if you don't mind, just leave me alone, okay? Where's your homework? I want to see it. Jack, I called Coach Young. I know he's benched you this week and next because of your grades. What? Mom, I can't believe you called him! Look, I bombed a couple of English papers, all right? But I'm making it up. And what about Biology? This is completely unacceptable! Mom, I said I'm making it up! You lied to me. Jack, honey, you know what I... We've always been able to talk to each other. Now, whatever it is, if there's a problem at school, or you're feeling a little bit sensitive about your skin. What about my skin, huh? Nothing, honey... Uh? Mom, just get out of here, all right! Leave! Jack! Get out of here! In the beginning, when it first happened, I told myself that it was teenage behavior... That it would pass. And the thing is, it did. We got along great for a couple of weeks there, just like we always had before. (KNOCKS ON DOOR) And just when everything seemed to be getting better... MIKE: Sally, this is Virginia Malloy. She's with social services. (DOOR CLOSES) Sally's husband and I coach little league together. I just checked with the hospital. Is he conscious? They'll call when there's a change. Mrs. Cambridge, you say tonight was an accident. I find that hard to understand. I didn't do this. (SLOW MELODY PLAYS) Hey. (MUSIC STOPS) (SLOW MELODY PLAYS) (OFF KEY NOTE PLAYS) (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) I like these. Thanks. But you know I find that music offensive. You do? Yes. I find the lyrics violent and degrading to women, and I wish you wouldn't listen to it. Here. Oh, please. No, here, listen to it. (LAUGHS) Sippie Wallace! (CHUCKLES) I haven't heard this in ages. Yeah, it's that song Bonnie Raitt sings. Yeah, Women Be Wise. It's an old Sippie Wallace song. Sixteen. Yep. Seems like only yesterday I was carrying you up four flights in a snuggly. (CHUCKLES) You know, I think I remember that. No, you couldn't. You were just a baby. We moved to Glenview Drive before you were one. Yeah. Dad was still in law school. Mmm-hmm. Day and night, and I was working day and night to keep a roof over our heads. Yeah. But we couldn't wait to get married. Or to have you. BRAD: No, don't tell me. Somebody who pulls straight A's in every class suddenly starts getting D's. I thought you wanted to play basketball. Look, Dad, I just don't think I'm that good, all right? I've just about had it with you. You'd better get your act together, mister. Get your foot off the chair! Okay, let's go, Leo! Ahh! Oh, boy! Hey, Dad. You guys go wait outside. I want to talk to your mother a little bit. Keep Marcia company. Have a fun weekend. I'll see you two Sunday evening. Bye, Mom. Bye-bye. Brad, I'm concerned about Jack. It's not just this or his coming in so late the other night. I feel like there are things going on with him. All right, tell me what's going on. He doesn't talk to me like he used to. Because you treat him like he's five years old. I do not. Sally, you gotta stay on top of this! I mean, we both have to stay on top of it, but you're the one who's here. Yes, I am. It's a matter of boundaries. If you set them, if you lay down the rules and stick to them, he's not gonna break 'em. Be his mother, not his friend. I'll keep that in mind. Listen, I needed to tell you, I've had a couple of rough months, but I'm gonna be able to send your check this week. So I'd appreciate it if you tell your lawyer and get him off my back. You really resent that, don't you? Your lawyer or supporting you? That money is meant for their support, Brad, not mine. I support myself just fine. (CHILDREN TALKING OUTSIDE) BRAD: Come on. Chop, chop! Let's go. In the car. Hey, Sally. (CAR DOORS CLOSE) (ENGINE STARTING) MAN: Hey, that's good. Thank you. How about a Tuscan-farmhouse look? Oh, we've done that already. I know, but I still like it. Hey, let's use that credenza we found at the marketplace against this wall. Oh, yeah, that'd be great. Hey, Frank, place looks gorgeous. Oh, thanks. Thanks. I just gotta finish up the molding in the master bedroom, and then I'm done. How you doin', Sally? Pretty good, thanks. FRANK: Good. Hey, that's a nice color. Yeah, I think so. So, uh, can I call you, then, next week? Yeah, that'd be great. Great. I'll do that. See ya. Bye. Are you going out with him? Finally! When did this happen? Oh, stop. Nothing's happened. We're just having dinner, that's all. Haven't I been telling you, you two would be perfect together? He's got a sense of color. That says a lot. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. (ENGINES REVVING) No way. I got it. I doubt it. (GAME-OVER SIGNAL BEEPS) Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Ahh! Where are you going? Ahh! You don't have a clue, do you? Let's deal with this, my man. (BLOWING) (INAUDIBLE) Hey, Luke, Jack. Are you guys following us? Maybe. Close your eyes. It's better that way. Told you. Kayla. I have to get some nachos or something in my blood sugar. See you guys around. See you. Go for it. Can I see you a moment, son? This way, please. Now, we have some excellent wallpapers that will just look sensational in here if you're still thinking that way. Yes, I believe you said you'd bring some samples. Yes, I did. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. Just a minute. (SIGHS) Hello? This is she. Yes. Yes, I'll be right there. (SIGHS) Wendy, I am so sorry. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave. But I'll call you later this afternoon, okay? (DOOR OPENS) SALLY: Thank you. Hello, I'm Sally Cambridge, Jack's mother. Mrs. Cambridge, I'm afraid we caught your son leaving a store with some merchandise in his pocket that he hadn't paid for. If you'll sign this waiver, you can take your son. He'll be getting a letter notifying you of the court date. Court? SECURITY: There'll be instructions on there giving you a number to call if he decides to plead guilty and pay the fine. Thank you. Jack. (RAP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Jack! Sit up and look at me now! What? What? I have to leave a meeting with a client, no, a potential client because my son has been arrested for shoplifting? Look, Mom, it wasn't shoplifting, okay? Oh, excuse me. What was it, then, amnesia? I was looking at the candles, I put them in my pocket, and I forgot. Candles? Look, I told you! Pink candles? I forgot! That's it! Oh, give me a break. Who were the other kids with you? Nobody. That's not what the officer said. It was Luke, wasn't it? Hmm? Wasn't it? Now, don't lie to me! I don't want you spending any more time with him, you understand me? I mean that! What about the girls? Jack, this is dead serious, and you know it. Now, just tell me! What, were you trying to steal for one of them? Did you think this was a way to impress them or something? (GLASS SHATTERS) BRAD: Troops! LEO: Mom! (GUNFIRE) No more victims remain. Sorry, you're destroyed. Hey, he did great, not one cavity. Oh, that's great. Mom, Dad got me the coolest game. See, these terrorists are in the neighborhood, and you get sniper rifles. And bazookas. Yeah, and bazookas. And you go through and shoot them. Eighty percent. (SCREAMING ON TV) LEO: Pow! I'm, uh... We'll do a little search and destroy this weekend, okay? I'll see you, buddy boy. Okay. Where's Jack? Upstairs. Asleep, I think. Everything all right? Oh, yeah. Just one of those days. Okay, I'll see you, then. Okay. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (MAN SCREAMING ON TV) (SIGHS) Did Dad leave? Mmm-hmm. I didn't get into this, but you and I have to. Mom... Jack, what was that? Getting so mad like that, where'd that come from? Jack, what's going on with you? Nothing. Nothing? Honey... Look, Mom, I don't know! (VOICE BREAKING) I'm sorry. I am. Dinner will be ready. I need one of you guys to set the table. (GUNFIRE ON TV) MAN: (ON TV) Ten percent... Keep terrorists back! Jack abused you verbally, physically? Yes. MIKE: Why'd you lie before? You did. You lied to the doctors, the officers. Because I was afraid! Afraid of your son? MIKE: You lied to me, too. I didn't want to get him in trouble. Did you sleep okay? Is that a yes or a no? Is something bothering you? No, not really. Jack, tell your brother that orange juice is good for him. Orange juice is good for you. Yeah. Thanks, very helpful. (SIGHS) Listen, this age... Oh, it's not just his age, it's all these little flare-ups. Oh, like his father, I remember. You know, I never did get the two of you, the few times I saw you and Brad together. He runs so hot and cold. Yeah, I guess he does, doesn't he? You know, that was never really clear to me until recently. You're kidding. No. I mean, I knew he was like that, but his temper was part of who he was. I was so young when we got married. I just looked at it as part of his appeal. It made me feel safe. I know how that sounds, but it did. Oh, I love this. Let's see if they'll hold this for us in case we do that B&B. Okay. Hey, this thing with Jack, it'll pass. He's such a sweet kid. And I've always been able to depend on him, but lately, something's off. I don't know him anymore. He's 16 with hormones. You're not supposed to know him. Yeah, but you read about all these troubled kids who, you know, they're learning how to make bombs on the Internet, or something. My sister, her oldest had big problems at this age. Now two years later, he's graduating with honors. He is? Yeah. Maybe you just need to give Jack some time. He's a good kid. Okay. (RAP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Around back. Thank you. Check in through there. His grades are down. He was dropped from basketball for two weeks, and he lied to me about it, and I'm concerned. I understand. Have you noticed anything else in addition to his grades? Well, you know, since his father and I divorced, I know the last couple of years have been unsettling for him, for both the boys. A lot of kids have to go through that kind of adjustment. I know no one wants to think about drugs, but it is a problem today, and that could be a factor. Well, it's just something to keep an eye out for. I understand. The best thing you can do is talk to him. Talk to him about his moods, the music he listens to, what's troubling him at school. The key here is to establish a dialogue and keep it going. (BELL RINGING) Hey. I got your note. Jack. That thing at the mall, that was so crazy that you did that. Didn't they, like, arrest you? They did? Yeah, I got off with a fine, but they banned me from the mall. They banned you? No way. Well, you know, I mean, you seemed to really like those candles, so, uh, I figured I'd get you some. Jack, I...I think that's so cool, and I really want us to be friends. Okay, sure. JACK: Got that, squirt? LEO: Hurry up, Jack. (CAR HORN HONKS) Thank you. Very good. Okay, let's see here. Ahh. Great. FRANK: Anybody home? Frank! Hi. Hi. Hey, you must be Jack, right? Yeah. Nice to meet you. And you must be Leo. Yeah. Hi. How you doing? Jeez, your mom did a super job on this place, didn't she? SALLY: Oh, uh, guys, this is Frank Cantor. He did all the cabinetwork in these houses. FRANK: Here. Oh, yeah, the catalog, great. FRANK: Now, I've told them all about you and Veronica, and you should really go, you know, have a look at their showrooms. Oh, we will. Yeah. You know, Frank did all the cabinetry in this house. Yeah, uh, we... We got that, Mom. Yeah. So, uh, Friday night, 7:30? Yeah, 7:30's fine. Great, I'll see you then. Okay. Nice to meet you guys. See you, Frank. See ya. Bye. Is Frank your boyfriend? Boyfriend. Leo! Come on, Mom. No, we're, uh, well... (DOOR CLOSING) He asked me out. A date? Yeah, I guess. He's divorced. He's a very nice man. Veronica and I have known him for a while now. Well, is she coming, too? (CHUCKLES) I just want you boys to be okay about this. Well, why wouldn't we be? I mean, you've gotta have a life, too, you know. Oh, hey. I didn't hear you come in. The boys will be right down. From your lawyer, about child support. I thought I explained it. Yes, you did. I'm sorry. I told him we worked it out. My secretary opened this. She's been keeping tabs on my billable hours as it is. Now she knows I can't pay her. I can't pay her! I'm sorry you're having trouble, but I don't... No, that's the trouble I'm having! You ready to go, honey? (BIRDS SINGING) (SIGHS) So, you've got this grade thing taken care of, right, and you're back in this week's game? Yes, to both. Good man. It's just a question of discipline. You're probably thinking about too many other things, girls. I wish I had you kids more than every other weekend. It's just not enough. Yeah. Hey, Dad, uh... Can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. Well... (SIGHS) There's this girl... See? What did I just say? Come on, seriously. And you know, she says she just wants to be friends. And right after she says that, she kisses me. You mean, like, uh... Yeah! But the thing is, I can't figure it out. What's to figure out? She laid one on you, right? Yeah. Well? (CHUCKLES) It's good. It's good. BRAD: So these two dumb guys, dumb bandits, they rob this bank, tear out of the parking lot, and speed onto the turnpike. (CHUCKLES) There's more to it, squirt. Oh. So the driver says, "Joe, look through the back window "and see if the cops are following us." So Joe looks through the back window and says, "How will I know?" So the driver says, "The flashers will be on, moron." So Joe looks out the back window, "Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No." Leo, you've got to eat the bun. He won't. That's because your mother allows him to eat like a four-year-old. Where is your mother, anyway? Probably out with Frank. Who's Frank? Her boyfriend. Your mother has a boyfriend? Yeah, it's some guy she works with. I don't know. He's divorced, too. Well, that's good. What's good? Sally's seeing someone. Frank... Uh, Cantor. Oh, good for her. Hey, Jack, why don't you ask Marcia about what we were talking about earlier? Dad... No, it's okay. I mean, Marcia was a high-school girl once. Uh, Dad, I think I can figure it out. He's got this girl that likes him, or he thinks she likes him. I said I can figure it out! Brad. Just... (DOOR CLOSES) What was that? If you've got something to say, you'd better learn to get it out, buddy boy. Express yourself. I mean, you can't expect the world to automatically know what's going on in your mind. You didn't think I was making fun of you, did you? I wouldn't do that. You and your brother mean more to me than anything in this world. (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) SALLY: Jack? (RAP MUSIC PLAYING) Leo, you have homework. I know. Hey. Hey. Honey, I have something to say. I know you don't want to hear it, but it's important that you and I keep the channels open. Mom, I... Establish a dialogue. Honey? Go ahead. It's an early birthday present. You got these for me? Well, of course. Who else? Thank you! Anyway, happy birthday. Hey, Leo. Hi. Mom! Frank's here. Come on in. Hey, thanks. (DOOR CLOSES) (GUITAR PLAYING) Hey, Jack. Nice ax. What is that, a Les Paul? Oh, it's nice. Oh, my! You look pretty great. Thank you. So do you. Thank you. Here, those are for you. They're beautiful. Thank you. I'll go put these in water. Okay. I made reservations at Casa Lanas, so, uh, we gotta kind of hurry up. We don't want to lose our spot. Hey, uh, Frank, keep your pants on, all right? Jack! It's all right. No, no. That...it really isn't. Just, uh, excuse me a second. (BANGS ON DOOR) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING) That was so rude! How would you like it if I talked to your friends like that? I don't have friends like that, Mom. That guy's a loser! What is the matter with you? Do you just not want me to have dinner with him? I don't care what you do. I have to use the bathroom, so get out of my way. Not until you answer me. If you don't want to move, fine. (GRUNTS) (DOOR CLOSES) Ooh. ANNOUNCER: Ooh! No holds barred! Thanks for doing this. Leo, honey, you know where your dad's number is, right? LEO: I know, Mom. That's a lovely necklace. Thank you. Jack gave it to me. He wanted me to apologize to you. He didn't mean to be rude. Well, good night, honey. Bye, mom. Love you. Luke, what's up, man. I can hardly hear you. Where are you? What's up? Yo, I'm at Newt's, man. He's having a party? Oh, yeah. Everybody's here, too. Whoo! Yo, Kayla came up and asked if you were gonna show. Dude, this chick wants you bad, man. You'd better get down here, all right? Get down here now, okay? All right, man. I can't find Gus. Look, if Mom calls, which she won't, just tell her I'm in the shower or something. I won't be gone long. Yeah, but where... (FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYS) Hey! (RAP MUSIC PLAYING) (VOMITING) Hey, man, what's up? Hey, man. BOY: What's up, man? GIRL: How you doing, Jack? (FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYS) (RAP MUSIC CONTINUES) Hey, have you seen Kayla? She's downstairs. (GIRL WHOOPING) What's up? Whoa! Relax! Relax! What are you doin'? What are you doin'? Come on, Jack. Chill it out, man! Jack! Listen, don't worry about it. You just need a beer. Here, take this. (FLAMENCO MUSIC CONCLUDES) (APPLAUSE) Whoo! Whoo! Here we are. (CHUCKLES) This was nice. You sound surprised. No. (CHUCKLES) Thanks for a great night. Thank you. OLIVE OYL: (ON TV) Help! Popeye, help! POPEYE: I am coming, Olive. Don't go away. Hey. Hey, you. Come on. Hey. Any messages? (TV TURNS OFF) Yeah. Someone named Wendy. Oh, Mrs. Rutherford. She's one of my clients. She says your meeting has to start at 9:00 sharp tomorrow morning because she has to do something after. Thank you, sweetie. You're a great little message-taker. Is Jack asleep? (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Leo, go to bed! Where did you go? You smell like beer! Were you out with Luke again? What if there had been an emergency? Mom, I was gone an hour, all right? You left your brother alone! He's 9 years old! He's fine! God! Jack, that is not the point. Look, just stop making it such a big deal, all right? A big deal? You think this is a big deal? This is nothing, my friend. You are grounded for a month! That means for the next four weeks, you come straight home after school, and you're staying in on the weekends! (CHUCKLES) What, you think I'm joking? All right, all right, as a matter of fact, I'm gonna call Luke's mother. I'm gonna tell her you two are not to see each other anymore. No, you're not. (DIALS PHONE) Look Mom, you're not calling Luke's mother! Oh, I think it's about time she and I had a little talk. Mom, I'm warning you, put the phone down. Aah! (VASE SHATTERS) (STRUGGLING) (SLAPS) No! Oh, God. Oh, my God. (GASPS) Just... Don't move! Don't move. Don't move. Okay, just stay right there, baby. (CRYING) Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. It's gonna be okay. WOMAN: (OVER PA) Pathology lab B, call 3467. Excuse me, where's your washroom? It's over there. Thank you. Honey, everything's gonna be all right, okay. Look at me now. It's fine. It's gonna be okay. I'll be right back. You just sit over here, okay? Okay, Mom. WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Schweitzer, please report to pediatrics. JACK: Ow! Aah! Nursing supervisor, please dial 6624. Nursing supervisor, please dial 6624. I don't think the anesthetic you gave him is strong enough. Mom. Okay. So you put your arm through a window. Yeah. How'd that happen? Oh, it was my fault, really. He, uh...well, I...I left something on the stairs, and he just tripped over it coming down. He must have been coming down pretty quickly. He was, you know, he fell forward, lost his balance, and his arm went right through the glass. What was it? Sorry? What did you trip on, Jack? I, uh, uh... Oh...it was my shoes. Would you excuse me a moment? Mmm-hmm. WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Cross, orthopedics. Dr. Cross, please report to orthopedics. Did you talk to Dad? So what'd you tell him? I told him that we were here, that you'd had an accident, but you were going to be okay. Mrs. Cambridge, I'm Tom Sperling from the department of social services. I need to file a report on what happened here tonight. Can I ask you a few questions? Of course. WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Waldridge, to admitting. Dr. Waldridge, please report to admitting. (GROANS) Hey, Dad. Does it hurt? No, they gave me some pain medicine. It's numb now. How'd it happen? Oh, Brad, come on. We're all exhausted. Come on. What? Where... I want to talk to Jack. BRAD: All right. Tell me exactly what happened, the truth. Well, we had a fight, all right? Wait. Take a seat. Take a seat. Who had a fight? WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Diamond, to pediatrics ICU. Dr. Diamond, to pediatrics ICU. I don't know what's wrong with me, Dad. There's nothing wrong with you. You can talk to me, Jack. I don't know, I just... I just feel so pissed off lately. About what? Tell me. I don't know, Dad! All right? I don't know! No, that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. Everybody feels pissed off or confused sometimes. That's normal. No, Dad, I feel like this every day. Then what? What was it that pissed you off? I don't know, I mean... Stuff at school. You know, and then this guy, Frank, came over tonight. Oh, so... So you don't like him. I don't know. Oh, he doesn't like you boys? Did something happen with Frank tonight? Is that what this was? You can tell me the truth, Jack. Did Frank hurt you? Yeah. Never be afraid to tell me anything. Let's go. WOMAN: (OVER PA) Nursing supervisor, please dial 6-6-2-4. Nursing supervisor, please dial 6-6-2-4. Leo, Marcia. Come on, we're out of here. Leo, is this your coat? Is this yours? Yeah. Take them. Let's go. We're out of here. Brad! BRAD: Out, out, out. LEO: Mom! Brad? Brad, what do you think you're doing? (CAR BEEPS) In the car. You tell me your son doesn't talk to you anymore? Well, maybe it's because your new boyfriend scares the crap out of him. What? I'm taking the boys home with me. Jack! Jack, what did you tell him? What did you tell your father? (CAR STARTING) Jack! Brad? (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) VERONICA: What on earth happened to you? Oh, uh, I just bumped into the table this morning running for the phone. Wendy Rutherford called. Oh, God, we were supposed to meet this morning. VERONICA: That's why she called. I juggled my meeting this afternoon so I could make time to see her. I'm sorry, I just got completely side-tracked. She wants to make a choice about who she's gonna go with, and now it may not be us. Veronica, I'm really sorry. What is up with you? It's Jack... I'm worried about him lately. I feel like... I'm losing him. Do you need to get some help here? Maybe the National Guard. No, I just have to set boundaries and stick with them... Be his parent, not his friend. He'll be fine. I got to go. Veronica, I am really sorry about Wendy Rutherford. Well, let's hope it's okay. (MARCIA CLEARS THROAT) (SIGHS) Leo. Has he had this problem for a long time? Because it's like every night... Waterworks. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Look, I was hoping you could get home early from work tonight. I think they need to spend some time with you. No, I can't. I mean, this is the only night I can do this deposition. Brad, I don't think they want to be here. Well, it's not quite that simple. Yeah, it is. Maybe, you should just take them home. BRAD: This is their home! What kind of father would I be if I sent them back? A realistic one. Honey, accidents happen. And that's what you think that was... An accident. What if it happens again? Well, I'm not going to let it. MARCIA: Have you really thought this through? What do you want? You want this to be a permanent arrangement? Honey, you knew how much I loved my kids when we married. MARCIA: So, that's what this is about? You're always trying to make it up to them, Brad. You have been since I met you. And now, maybe you're trying to convince yourself that there's a problem because deep down inside what you really want is for them to live with us. Yeah, and maybe you're convincing yourself that everything is fine because deep down, you don't! Marcia, I... I'm sorry. (SIGHS) Hey... I love you. When I married you, I signed on. Now, I swear to you... If I thought for one second those boys were at risk, I'd be the first to insist they stay. Okay, let's go. You're gonna be late. I'm gonna be late. Yeah. See you later. MIKE: Sally. Hey. Mike! Hi, how you doing? MIKE: Good. Good. Okay! I heard you made detective. Yeah, third precinct, right here. Congratulations. Thanks. That's wonderful. You want to come up for a minute? No. No, no thanks. I just wanted to stop by and, uh... Brad asked me to stop by. Oh, God, Mike, come on. You know Brad. You know how he flies off the handle. I read the report from social services. Now, uh... No matter what Brad says, there are red flags there. Mike, these are my kids. They're all I have. If I thought for a second that I might lose them, I don't think I could take that. MARCIA: Sally. Hi. Hi. Where are the boys? Well, Leo's over at Cory's, and Jack's out with Luke. Brad, no. MARCIA: Sally, why don't you come in? Oh, thank you. Brad, we have to talk. Well, there's nothing to say. I don't want this Frank guy around the boys. Oh, Frank had nothing to do with what happened. Then what are you saying, Jack lied? Jack has a very short temper. I'm worried about him becoming violent. (SCOFFING) Oh, that's ridiculous. No, it's not! I can't believe what you pulled at the hospital! See, this is what you do. You always make me out to be the bad guy. No, I do not. I have been very careful not to do that, even when you left. I didn't leave the boys. I left you. Oh, I know that. But when you moved out, you moved out of their house, too, and their lives changed because of it. We can't keep jerking them around like this. Now, what happened with Jack was a freak accident, and he and I need to deal with it, okay? Please bring them home... For their sake. (SIGHS) Okay, I'll bring them home tomorrow morning. Thank you. Sally, I'm going to be watching. And if the next time I see the boys, if either one of them has a hair out of place, I swear to God, I'm gonna get custody. And I can. And I will. (DOOR OPENING) LEO: Mom! SALLY: Boy, am I glad to see you! I know. Gus! Come here, Gus. (SMACKS LIPS) Come here, boy! Honey, you know how Gus is. He'll come home when he's good and ready. He and Dad played poker last night. He nearly beat Dad. Wow. Well, we're having hamburgers tonight, the way you like them. LEO: (EXULTING) Oh, ho! Hey. Hi. How's the arm? It's a... It's a little sore, but it's okay. (INHALES DEEPLY) Things have to change. Yeah. I know. SALLY: I'm serious. Why did that happen? I mean, we've been through this. I get so angry. Honey, when you get angry, you have to talk, not get that way. I know. I'm sorry, Mom. It will never happen again. Just promise me. I promise. Oh, Jack. JACK: I'm sorry. I know. (PHONE RINGING) SALLY: Leo! Dinner's ready. (BEEPS) Hello? Oh, hello, Frank. Ooh, Frank, huh? Oh. Well, everything's been just uh... Well, it's been a little crazy around here. You know what, you should invite him over for dinner. I'll show him my lava lamp, huh? That'll get him going. (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm just kidding, Mom, all right? But, uh, seriously, you should invite him over. Uh, Frank... What are you doing Friday? (WHISTLE BLOWING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Come on, you two! Take a shot. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Okay, let's move, guys. Bus is outside. (INDISTINCT CLAMORING) Let's go. MAN: Hit back. Aren't you coming? I thought you got your stitches out. Nah, I won't be ready to play until next week. What a big loss. Hey, Kayla's saying that kissing you was like kissing her grandmother. LEO: No anchovies. FRANK: What? Oh, no, no, you can't have a Caesar salad without anchovies. SALLY: Mmm, I'm afraid I'm with Leo on that one. Oh, come on. Here you go. These are not going to be spicy. Hey, Jack. Uh, Frank's just making his special Caesar salad. (CHUCKLES) Great. Do you know why caribou are always on the move? No, why are caribou always on the move? Is this a joke? No, it's real. I'm asking if you know. Leo is very into natural science right now. Oh. They're always on the move 'cause they're always looking for food. That's right, moss. Lichen. Hey, you really know your stuff. (FORK CLANGS LOUDLY) You been there? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have. Uh, they eat the lichen, and it takes years for it to grow back. So that's why they keep moving. FRANK: Right. You know, I photographed a herd of them a couple of years ago when I was up there. I'll show you guys some time. LEO: Wow, that's so cool. SALLY: Mmm. Good night. Good night. (RAP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY) (MEOWING) Jack? (CLATTERING) SALLY: Jack, what happened? I tripped. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) You tripped? Yeah. (MUSIC STOPS) Quite the liar you've become. Yeah. Well, I... I learn from the best. Jack... I appreciate the effort that you made tonight. He was making fun of Leo! Oh, he was not! He was trying to talk to Leo about things that interest him. Oh, don't, okay? Oh, would you please talk to me? Just tell me... JACK: Tell you what? Tell you why I don't trust this guy? SALLY: Jack... JACK: Would you even listen to me, Mom? Frank was just trying... I know what Frank was trying to do, Mom! All right, I don't want you seeing him anymore! And I don't want him over at my house ever again. Because if you let him over here, I can't guarantee what'll happen. You can't guarantee? Okay, honey, I realize tonight was a little tense. But Frank is a decent, good man. And he's had an interesting life. And if you would just give him a chance... Shut up, all right? I'm not listening to you anymore! Jack! (JACK GRUNTS) (SHRIEKS) (GRUNTS) (DOORBELL RINGS) (SALLY SHRIEKS) (DOORBELL RINGING CONTINUES) (SALLY SIGHING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) Ma'am, we've had a call from one of your neighbors about the noise. Oh, my son... His music. No, they said that it was more than just music. They heard shouting, crashes. Oh, well, he, uh... He tripped over his guitar, and there was a... It was a lamp... A lamp fell. I was just, you know, moving some books, and I had a whole armload when you came, and I just dropped them. Hi. This is my son... Jack. Uh, I'm sorry about the music, officers. I didn't realize it was so loud. I try and tell him. Is there anyone else in the house? No. Well, just my other son, but he's... Here. All right. Try to keep the noise down for the rest of the night? Yeah. Yes, I'm sorry. (TELEPHONE RINGING) SALLY: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi. If you want to leave a message for Sally, Jack, or Leo, you know what to do after the beep. (BEEP) VERONICA: Sally, it's Veronica. Sally? (EXHALES) Listen, I know you're going through stuff right now, but you have to let me know if you're not coming in or where you are. I have been trying to get you all day. Frank has, too. Anyway, it looks like we lost the Rutherford job. She hired Paul Hess instead. Would you please give me a call when you get this? (PHONE DISCONNECTS) (GUS MEOWING) Gus? Mom! Come quick! Mom! He broke his leg. Vet says he'll be okay. Probably have a limp, though. Something beat him up pretty bad. He has a cast on... Like a human. Honey, let's not forget to give him his pain medicine. LEO: Okay. (JACK CRYING) I'm sorry. I'm sorry for it, Gus. I didn't mean it. Oh, God, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING) (SIGHS) (TYPING) We have several books on child abuse. No, actually... I'm not sure, really, how to put this, but it's more the other way around. Uh, parent abuse. (COMPUTER BEEPS) Yes, it looks like we have one title on that subject, "The abuse of elderly parents by adult children." Nothing about teenagers? No. Sorry. MAN: (ON PHONE) Are you looking for a hot-line for teenagers? No, about teenagers... Parents who are abused by teenagers. WOMAN: (ON PHONE) This is a hospital for psychiatric disorders for people in crisis who either can't take care of themselves or might be a danger to others. MAN: (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry, ma'am, we're a drug-rehab program. You might try Al-Anon. (BEEPS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Really, we're a shelter for women who are victims of spousal abuse. No, I know that. It's just I don't know where else to... Or who else to talk... I've called everybody, and they just put me on hold. They don't know what to tell me. They don't know where to refer me. I know, it's tough. Have a seat. Uh, I got your number from the local abuse hot line, and I... I thought... If you're having difficulty with a child, generally... He's got such rage. So his behavior frightens you at times? Is he a danger to himself or to anyone in the household? Does he shove you, kick you? He needs help. I don't know where to get him help. I don't know what to do anymore. What you have to do, and I can tell you from our experience here, is just try to stay calm. If there's an argument going on, don't continue it. Do not yell... Walk away, separate yourself from him. He's really a good boy. Stay away from anywhere where there might be potential weapons. The kitchen, the bathroom... Get out of the house if you have to. I think you should go to the police. File a protection-from-abuse order. It's a PFA. Well... What does this mean, exactly, this PFA thing? It's a court order that will protect you, keep him away from you, remove him from your home if necessary. (SIGHING) (DOOR SHUTS) Will you be coming to stay here? No. (INDISTINCT DISPATCH CONVERSATIONS) (PHONE RINGING) All right, let's go. Come on. Move it. MAN: (ON RADIO) Male Hispanic, black and brown, 5'6", 160... (BEEPING) JANE: Hello, Sally. SALLY: Hi. Jane, uh... ...would you like to go get yourself some coffee? Uh, sure. Thank you. (DOOR BEEPS AND SHUTS) (SIGHS) Sally. I have to tell you something about what happened with Jack's arm... ...what really happened. He came in late. I was upset, and we had an argument, and somehow it got... Physical. Physical how? Jack tried to hurt me. (SCOFFS) Come on. SALLY: He... He meant to hit me, but he put his fist through the window instead. So you're telling me that Jack was the one that instigated this incident. His temper, his... You're the grown-up here! You need to control the situation. No, you don't understand... We're talking about a 16-year-old boy. I know. I know. I thought things were getting better, and I wanted to believe, you know, that maybe he'd really changed, but he hasn't! He keeps doing it! He keeps telling me, he's never going to do it again, and then he lashes out at me. Did you push him? Brad! If you did, I'm going to find out. You aren't listening! He has these violent outbursts where he's not himself, and he's riding on some deep, deep rage. Now, we're his parents. We have to do something. Mmm. I think the boys should come live with me. Oh, don't do this to me! You've done it to yourself! Our son is in serious trouble, and he needs our help! You know, all those years before... You... Oh, Brad, let me say this. I never really saw it, but you treated me the same. I never once lifted a finger against you. But it was the same as if you had. I'd think everything was over. Things were changed. It was going to be peaceful. Then you'd go off into one of your rages again, yelling at me and belittling me. I... I feel like there's something still in my house... You. (SCOFFS) (DOOR BEEPING) They... They say file a protection order or have him arrested. I can't. I can't do that. What if they take him away from me? He's my son. What did I do? No, it's not your fault. It's no one person's fault. He's my little boy. Sally... He's not a little boy anymore. He's not a grown-up either. I mean, he's just 16, but he's this monster, and this rage... I don't know. Where could that go next? Oh, come on. MARCIA: Hey, Leo, you haven't touched your dinner. Uh, Leo doesn't like lasagna. Yeah. I told her last time we were here. I forgot, Leo. Look, why don't you just try it? If you don't like it... LEO: I don't like it! I told you! Don't you listen? Well, maybe if you acted your age, Leo, I'd have more respect for what you had to say. Leo, why don't you try it? You always take her side. BRAD: Leo, that's not true. Honey, maybe if you'll... (MARCIA GROANS) Perfect, Brad. You shut up! I said I'm sorry. BRAD: That's not the point, Leo! The point is, both of you know that outbursts like that... Well, that's not the way to solve problems. Men of integrity never respond like that. What I'm trying to say, Leo, is the way you just behaved is unacceptable and can never happen again. Yes, sir. BRAD: If it does, not only will I be disappointed in you, I won't be able to respect you. Let's go see Marcia. You've got something to tell her. Okay. Where you going? Home. I have to tell Mom something. What? That I'm sorry. (ZIPPER CLOSES) (SMOOCHING) FRANK: No, thank you. (CHUCKLES) (DOOR OPENS) Frank? (GASPS) (DOOR SLAMS) (RAP-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Jack? Jack! (SALLY SHRIEKS) (GRUNTING) (GLASS BREAKING) SALLY: No! Mom? Jack! Stop it! SALLY: No! Leo! (SOBBING) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (GASPING) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Uh, I need an ambulance. 18 Rosemary Drive. My son hit his head, and he's not moving. Mom... (SALLY CRYING) (SIREN WAILING) (POLICE SIREN WAILS) Yeah. Hop to it. (CRYING) You want to tell us what happened? What happened to your face, son? (CRYING) One step here, and two behind you. MAN: The back is clear. It's okay, baby. I'm right here, okay? Ma'am, put your hands behind your back, please. I'm afraid you'll have to come with us. Sally Cambridge, you're under arrest on suspicion of child abuse and endangerment. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. SALLY: I have to go. I have to ride with him. You have the right to talk with an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided at no cost. Do you understand these rights, Mrs. Cambridge? I am telling you the truth. Mike... He needs help. He'll, uh, be charged with assault. Against his brother, against you. I don't see how there's any other way. (MONITOR BEEPING) Tell me again. Tell me what happened. He, uh... He tripped. BRAD: So, Where is she now, Mike? She's in the waiting room. Jack... I don't care what she says, all right? She's the one with the problem. She's the one who needs help. So you had nothing to do with this? No. Fine, then. JACK: So what's going to happen to her? Well, she's probably going to jail. Don't you think she should go to jail? Look... I need to talk to her, all right? Son, I don't think that'd be a good idea... BRAD: Jack! Wait! (CLATTERING) Mom? SALLY: Jack? Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was my fault. I'm sorry. (WOMAN SPEAKING OVER PA) It was my fault. I pushed Leo. You pushed your brother? I didn't mean to, Dad. It was an accident. Mom, I never meant for this to happen. I'm sorry. Jack, I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me, son. (HANDCUFF CLINKING) You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Okay, Cambridge... This is you. (BUZZER BEEPING) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIREN WAILING) VERONICA: Sally, you didn't do anything wrong. (MONITOR BEEPING) I know. Hey, you. Morning. Hey, Mom. You okay, sweetheart? (INAUDIBLE) Hey. Hi. Frank's here. He's going to stay with you while I'm gone. But I'll be back in a couple of hours, okay? So you just rest. Well, thanks for doing this. Sally, take as much time as you want, okay? Okay. He's going to be fine. Bye. So, Leo, how you doing? Huh? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Mrs. Cambridge, Mr. Cambridge, I'm Robert Nicholas. I'm the juvenile probation officer. Would you follow me, please? (DOOR OPENS) Well, the prosecutor's office is not going to drop the assault charges. (SIGHS) I don't know what I expected. They are willing, however, to defer the charges if you file what's called an at-risk-youth petition. Sure. What is it? It's a court order that helps set limits for youths under 18. If teens violate those conditions which are set forth, including counseling or attending a program, they can be charged with contempt and put in 7 day detention... Lock-up. But... But what program? ROBERT: Well, there aren't too many. But there is one over in McCade County. That's where I'm going to be referring Jack. There he'll have private counseling, group sessions, and each of you will have to see someone as well. Now, you also indicated that, uh... There's no relatives for him to stay with. No, not in the area. All right, we'll have to have him in a foster-care situation by this afternoon. Oh, no, now, if he's... If he's getting help, I don't see why we have to do that. ROBERT: Mrs. Cambridge, if a parent allows one child to abuse another child in this state, the parent can be charged with child abuse. Now, you run the risk of losing custody of your youngest son as well. We understand, Mr. Nicholas. ROBERT: Once Jack shows progress through counseling, and if there's real behavior change... Well, then he can come home. How much time do you think that would be? I know it's hard to tell, but... Well, it... It took a long time for Jack to learn this behavior. It's gonna take a long time for him to learn to change that behavior. The program requires a minimum commitment of six months. BRAD: I know what you're thinking. I know... That there have been times when I've lost it. (SOBBING) I go too far. And our sons see it! Brad, if we're going to pull this off, we have to be there for Jack together. We have to work at this like we never worked at anything the entire time we were married. WOMAN: Joe, how do you feel today? Satisfied. MAN: Okay. (SNIFFS) WOMAN: Russell? Frustrated, I guess. WOMAN: Jack, this is how we start out each session. Everybody checks in with a feeling. You can use the chart if you need to. Comfortable. Fine. Russell? Do you want to take some time to talk about why you're feeling frustrated? Okay, that's cool. Oh, he was great. He was my daddy. He could be stern. You never knew when he was gonna blow. THERAPIST: At you? Not really... No. Mostly at my mother. The whole time I was growing up, she was always walking on eggshells, trying to keep the peace but never quite pulling it off. She would never have done anything to end her marriage. She didn't live to see me fail at mine. THERAPIST: Sally... All those years, you watched your mom tolerate your father's verbally abusive behavior. The fact was, you couldn't tolerate the same behavior from your husband. You didn't fail at your marriage. What you did by getting out of it was very healthy. Look, I can't help it, all right? Sometimes I just... I snap. That's just the way I am. WOMAN: Violence is not your identity, Jack. JACK: Did I say that? WOMAN: Yeah, you did. You said that's the way you are, but it's not. It's the way you act. It's a choice. It's a conscious choice. Whatever. SALLY: I know that! I have been over that a million times in my mind, and I know that I make rules, and then I don't do anything when he breaks them. I just let it slide. I know that I do that. I just don't know why. I try. It's just... There's so much. There's so many balls in the air at once, and I know that when he pushes, and I give in and change the rules to avoid a showdown, that... I can't. You can't what? I can't do this. It's too hard. It's doubly hard for you, Sally. You had an abusive husband. Now you're having to deal with that same behavior in your son. My dad never hit my mom! No, but you did, Jack. Why is that? Do you blame her for your dad leaving? My dad is a good guy. MAN: So you do blame your mom. Look, I never said that! What are you saying man, you punched a hole through a window for the fun of it? Couldn't help being Daddy, huh? WOMAN: When your dad left, you felt like you had to take on a lot of responsibility, didn't you? I handled it. You weren't supposed to handle it. You were the child. I was the oldest! The oldest kid. JOE: Your dad yelled a lot at your mom, right? Yeah, I did! He did. JOE: Man, that's what we call abuse. RUSSELL: Yeah, straight up. WOMAN: You do what you know. Do you understand what I'm saying? He was your role model, Jack. When Dad left... I just... I felt this relief, you know, that he was gone. And I know you felt that, too, Mom. I know you did. Jack... Oh, I just... I didn't know why... ...he had to do that to us, why he acted that way and why you let him. I couldn't stop him. I... I didn't know how. (SIGHS) I didn't either. It's okay. (SIGHS) I'm so sorry, Mom. It's going to be okay. I don't know what to do. I think you're doing it, sweetheart. We both are. Hmm. (PLAYING PIANO) Ready? You want me in now? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. (BOTH PLAYING) (OFF KEY NOTE PLAYS) SALLY: (CHUCKLES) Oh, man. Here we go. What are you doing? (MUSIC STOPS) JACK: Okay, one more time. (MUSIC RESUMES) Left hand here, yeah? No. Yeah. No. Right... (JACK CHUCKLES) JACK: All right, Mom, stop. Stop. All right, your left. There you go. SALLY: Very good.
