- It took us 13 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. We arrived in New York City in 1953. My uncle Antonio picked us up at the pier. My name is Giuseppe. In America, they call me Joey. This is a true story about my family. Our first apartment on East 14th Street was very humble, but always filled with warmth and laughter. Jack... Jack was a genius with the slight of hand. Papa was very proud of his talent. When I was a kid, my brother Jack made some great moves for me. You know, I could sit and watch him for hours and hours. Papa used to say, Jack is a natural born magician. [police siren sounds] - ♪ Trouble ♪ - Hey! - ♪ So much trouble ♪ - Hey! - Hey! [whistles] Hey!

If you're so worried about Mama and Jack, why don't you move back home and you take care of them, all right? Otherwise, just get off my back. [dog barking] - When I first moved here, it was wonderful. Everybody knew everybody. The people were friendly. Now, forget it. I go shopping. Once in a while I hear somebody say, "Hello, Sarafina." By the time I want to say something, they already across the street. - [speaking Italian] Sarafina, I've got to go. - No, where you gonna go? - Yeah, yeah, there she is, Vinny. - ...a little espresso. In the meantime, my husband comes home and we all go together, we help you. - Buona sera, Mrs. Rosalie, how are you? - Oh. - I got to go, I got to go Sarafina. [speaking Italian] - Ciao, ciao, I'll see you. We got to find your brother. - Mama, how many times I got to tell you not to come to the city by yourself? - What can I do? No one to help me. - No one to help you? What do you mean there's no one to help you? What am I, [speaking Italian]? I'm the one who keeps this family together, remember that. - Have I ever let you down, Mama? - You and Salvatore, always too busy when your mama needs you. - All right, that'll be $9.55. - Huh? - $9.55. - Yeah, I'm gonna ask my mama. - What? Wait a minute, where you going? - I got no money, stay here one second. - You've got no money? [speaking Italian] - Man, what are you doing here, huh?

Two days I worry. [horn honking] - Ma, I got a taxi waiting. - Don't give him any money mama. - Another taxi. - Why didn't you take the train? What's wrong with you? - Joe, I had no money, that's why. - What do you think that money grows on the tree. - Oh! The singer! [singing] - Where the hell have you been? We been going crazy looking for you. [doorbell] - What's that? - It's the taxi driver, Vinnie. - You took a cab? - I took a cab. - This is the last time I give you money, here. - Mama, I got it. - You don't got money, here. - Ma. - How much do I owe you? - It's $9.55.

You want to kill yourself? - See Ma, you've been going through my pockets again, Ma. - I have to empty your pockets to wash your pants. - Tell me you're gonna wash my pants and I empty my own pockets. - I had a good idea yesterday.

Give me some money. - I don't have money. - Give me the pills. - This, no! - Ma, those are my pills! - I am not going to-- - Give me the goddamn pills! - No! [speaking Italian] - We can't afford to get married right now, okay? I have no money, no security, nothing. - We're both working. - Working? I can't even afford to pay half the rent. - I'm making very good money. You hate my job, I know, but it's only until I get my degree and then I'll be making enough money to take care of both of us. - Don't you understand? I don't want you to take care of me. I want to take care of you. I want to give you things that I never had. - That is not important to me. - Well, it's important to me. - Vincent, I am 30 years old, my clock is ticking. - So is mine. - Will you listen to yourself? You make it sound like marriage is some kind of death chamber. - Fine. You want to get married? Fine, we'll get married. - Don't do me any favors. - Didn't you just say you wanted to get married? - Just forget about it. - I love you, baby. - Yes, girl he was looking fine. I know. Yeah, well anyway, I've got to go. I'll talk to you. Okay, bye, bye. - Hey Vicky. - Hey. - How you doing? You in a good mood today? - I'm always in a good mood, how about you? - I feel terrific. Is Mr. Washington in? - Vinnie, you don't have an appointment. - I know, but I thought maybe you can just pencil me in. - Excuse me. Mr. Brown, you can go in now. Thank you. - How'd he get in? - He was here on Wednesday between three and six like everybody else. Why don't you just do the same? - Because I'm not like everybody else. ♪ [blues music plays] ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Nothing in this world ♪ ♪ Could take my blues away ♪ - You're a talented young man, Vinnie. You got a wonderful voice and you write good lyrics. But I got to be real honest with you Vinnie. Your music, it's not commercial. You listen to the radio, Vinnie? - No, not really, no. - Ah, that's your problem. You got to listen to the hits. Good looking Italian boy like you, you should be singing pop music, not the blues. It's depressing. Leave that to the colored artists, they were born to sing the blues. Listen to the hits of today. Listen to the Animals, listen to the Beatles. Because I'm telling you, the British groups are invading American rock 'n roll and I predict by the middle of '64 they'll be number one. - I don't want to waste the rest of my life trying to get a recording contract. What do you think, Carol? - You really want to know? - You're right. Maybe I should just get a nine to five just forget about everything. - I never said that. - What else can I do? Ten years in this business and I have nothing to show for it. - Don't do that. Don't feel sorry for yourself. Listen to me. Why don't you write something like that, you know, that-- - What? Like what? What, like the Animals or the Beatles? I'm not the Animals or the Beatles, I'm me. And I want to write and play the music that I like in the style that I like. That's what makes me different. Let's get married, Carol. No priest, no rabbi, no nobody. Just you and me. I mean why do we got to do this conventional bullshit, you know what I mean? Let's go to Vegas. - Vegas? - Carol, that's where the action is. I don't care if I have to play in a lounge, I don't care anymore. - Honey, let's talk about this later, I got to go in. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to dump all this shit on you, I'm just-- I just got to get this out. - Honey, it's okay. I love you anyway, even if we never get married. - Honey, you're the best. - Okay. - Vincenzo, if you ever need anything, I mean anything, I want you to know you can count on me. I know a lot of people east and west. Judges, lawyers, politicians, doctors, plumbers. Everybody knows me. Ever hear of the Chain Gang? - You mean the real Chain Gang? - Yeah, the one that Bogie, Eddie G. and Big Al belong to. - What about it, Rocco? - I'm one of the original members. - You used to be an actor? - What actor? Actors are fags, I'm the real thing. So, Vincenzo, when are you gonna fix us up with a couple of nice young broads, huh? - Hey, if you ever have sex with a younger girl it could be fatal. - Yeah, if she dies she dies. Come on Antonio, let's go play a little bocce. - Have a nice game, guys. - You ever hear of Joe DiMaggio? - Listen, I don't give a shit about this. How much longer do we have to wait? - Well, DiMaggio is the greatest baseball player ever lived. When I was 10 years old, my old man took me to Yankee Stadium to see him play. Guy could hit a ball a mile long. Here we go. - Is this the guy? - That's the guy. Stick this is your pants. - What for? - It's good for business. - What's the matter with you? I'm not a fag. - Who's a fag? I'm a fag, now? - Yeah, you are. What are you doing, huh? - Get wise to yourself, will ya? - Jesus. - How you doing now? I got a kid just off the boat over here, he's hung like a fucking lion. You know what I mean? [phone ringing] - That's it? - Well, well, well, what do we have here, kid, huh? Possession of narcotics with intention to sell is a felony. - Listen, I wasn't selling. This is for me-- - That's not what I saw. That's not what I saw. You can get a one to three upstate for this. Now I need names. You'll be under protection. - I know nothing. I swear. Come on, please, let me go. What are you doing, huh? Are you taking me in for a nickel bag? Come on, you piece of shit! Let me go! - Salvatore, I got to take off. - No, you stay, you have a drink with your brother, first up. - I don't know. - One quick drink. Nice dry wine, you're going to like, huh? Salute, huh? How you doing? You doing good? - Good. - You need anything?

So, uh, what are you going to do about the stripper? - I'm gonna marry her. - Want a stripper for a wife? She's not even a Catholic. - She's not a stripper Sal, she's gonna be a psychologist. - Stripper, psychologist, same thing. Either way, you're gonna get screwed. - Mind your business on this one, okay? - No, Vincenzo, listen to me. Hold on a second. Buona sera, Ponte Vecchio, may I help you? Arrested? Again? - I'm no pusher. I would never do that, come on. - You're sick, you need help. - No, I swear I'm okay. - We can't be responsible for you anymore, don't you understand me? - You hate me. You don't give a shit about me. - When are you gonna realize you're throwing your life down the drain? I love you Jack, but I can't do this anymore. - No? I want to talk to Mama now. - You ask her to bail you out I'll never talk to you again. - What are you reading, Joey? - The sonnets of William Shakespeare. - You understand that shit? - Yeah. He's an amazing writer, Vinnie let me tell you. Listen. "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone, beweep my outcast state." - I'm so ashamed. I wish I was dead, Ma. - Basta! - No, I wish God took me instead of Papa. - Basta. - Please, Ma, take me home. - I speak to your brothers. We see what we can do. - Ma, Ma, please, Ma, take me home. Don't leave me here, Mama. Mama, please! Mama! Mama! [speaking Italian] Mama! - I curse the day we come to this country. - Mama, don't blame yourself, it's not your fault. - Your papa, God rest his soul, would not listen to me. He wanted to bring the family to America, for a better life. - We'll pick you up in the morning. - Giuseppe, call the taxi. - Mama, he needs help. - All right, I call myself. - You are just like Jack. You never listen to anybody. - Mrs. Caselli, you understand that in the event your son fails to show up in court you lose all your money? - She knows, she's done this before. - Taxi. Taxi! - Where to? - Bensonhurst. - Avenue B and 4th. - Bensonhurst, 53 and New Utrecht. - We have to make a quick stop. I got to pick up something. - We pick up nothing.

Mama put down her life savings for you and you don't care what the hell happens. - Nothing's gonna happen to me. Go home. - No, I'm gonna take you home with me, Jack. - Get out of here! - I'm not gonna let you go, Jack! - You got any money? - Get out of my pockets! Get out of my pockets! - Hey, open the door! - You're not supposed to smoke on the bus. - Joe, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. Sometimes you're a big pain in the ass. - I'm a pain in the ass? - Yeah. - Let me tell you something, you're the biggest pain in the ass that I know. You have no respect for anybody. You treat Mama like dirt. All you care about is your stinking drugs. - You think I like what I do? Huh? - Obviously. - You don't know what it's like to be me.

Now, get up! - I'll walk. I'll walk. - Carol, listen I really want to thank you for coming down. I'm--I'm sorry for dragging you into this mess. I'm sorry. - Joey, I'm glad you called. But I worry about you, you know? - Th-- Thanks a lot. But I'm fine. - You could get hurt out there. - I know, but what could I do, you know? I've got to take care of my family. - I understand that Joey, but if something happens to you, what's going to happen to your mother? You've got to be a little more careful, okay? - Carol, I love you. And I appreciate what you're trying to do but Jack's not your responsibility, okay? - Do you know what that makes me feel? That makes me feel like I'm not a part of this family. Honey, I know you're doing the best you can but you got to look at the truth. What I'm trying to make you understand is that Jack's problems are much deeper than you think. I don't know what, but something is troubling him. - Jack was a stable kid before he got into drugs, though. - How do you know that? - He's my brother. I know. - Vince, I don't think you know your brother as well as you think you do. - Papa spoiled him rotten when he was a kid. Got more attention than God. Everything came easy for him. That's why he doesn't know how to take care of himself. You know? Too much attention can cripple a kid. You give this to Mama, huh? It's a Goddamned shame. Could have made a goddamn fortune. Could have been another Houdini. How much for the lawyer? - $100. - There. Let's go. Son of a bitch. He did it. Hey, Onassis! You taking over the whole block? - What's the problem? - I won't let you do this, Nico. - This a free country, I do what I want to do. - You can't open Italian restaurant across the street from me. I won't let you. - You got Sicilian Trattoria, I'm opening an Italian restaurant, with good food. - Nico, what the hell you know about Italian food? - I don't have to know anything. I have a good chef from Rome. - Nico, 20 years you and your family owned the Greek coffee shop down the block from me. You made plenty of money, okay? You can't open an Italian restaurant across the street from me and take money from me. I won't let you. - I take nothing from you. Besides, competition is good. You want open up a Greek restaurant next to me, go ahead. [speaking Italian] - I'm trying to handle this like a gentleman. Please don't force. - Are you threatening me? - What, what's going on around here? What's all the yelling about? - Onassis here wants to open up an Italian restaurant across the street from me. I won't let him. - If you want to open an Italian restaurant, we'll find you a nice spot in the neighborhood. What are you worried about? - I already put money on a ten year lease. - Don't worry, we'll get you your money back. - Salvatore, [speaking Italian] your brother Gioachino run away. [speaking Italian] - Mama. Mama. Let's go home. You okay? - Where did you go? - I went out for cigarettes. - Why didn't you tell mama you went for cigarettes? - Why? I got to tell mama every little thing I do, huh? Don't push me. What's wrong with you, huh? - Stop it. Stop it! - What's the matter? Don't you never push me again, okay? - Stop that now. - I'm sorry Mama, sorry. You're supposed to get me off, why did you say guilty? - You've got a track record as long as my right arm. But I know how to deal with this judge. If we fight him he's gonna put you behind bars. Is that what you want? - Vince, you promised to get me a good lawyer. - He is a good lawyer. - If he was a good lawyer he would get me off. - Senor Squatriglia, please. I want to send my son to Sicily. Can you do this, huh? - Ma, I don't want to go to Sicily. - Senora, your son has committed a crime. - That's bullshit! - Hey! Shut up and listen. - We have two choices: rehabilitation or prison. - Mmm, something smells good. Mama, Joey's cooking again. - Yeah, he tries. - What do you mean I try? I'm great. - Oh, dio mio, look at this mess. - Mama, I'm cooking. What do you expect, huh? - You better clean everything good, huh? I don't like a dirty kitchen. - Giuseppe, what did you make? - What did I make? I made linguini ala Giuseppe, ah? With everything. Clams, mussels, squid, onion, garlic, [speaking Italian], olive oil and Boca de vino. - Ah bravo, bravo. - Huh? - Mmm. - Eh? - Tastes good. - Good? - Better let Salvatore know, he might put you to work in a kitchen. - Vinny, how did it go over there today? - Good. - Vincenzo, [speaks Italian] - You okay, Mama? - The wedding. Wait until your brother gets home. - Mama, how can you ask me that? - You want me to come to your wedding? - Carol and I have already made plans, Mama. - Change the plans. - I can't do that. - Your brother is in jail, you want me to celebrate. - He's not in jail, Mama, he's in a program where he belongs. We're doing it again, making sacrifices for Jack. - What can we do? - I love Jack just as much as you do, Mama. But he's not your only son. - Give him one more chance, huh? Do it for me, please. - Joey, I'd give Jack a job in a minute if I was sure he's going to stay clean. - He is clean. - All right, don't kid yourself. He'll be back on drugs whether I give him a job or not. - What should we do? Leave him in the street like a dog? - What do you expect me to do? Neglect my business and look after Jack? I'm in this place 16 hours a day. I don't have time to see my own kids. - If you don't give him a job, who is going to help him? - Himself. - Who helped you? Uncle Antonio's money. - Listen to me. He's gonna make it this time. I saw him today. We saw him today. He looked great. I wouldn't ask you that if I didn't believe it. - Ah, but Vincenzo. - He's not asking you, I am. - Do you remember what papa used to say? Huh? La famiglia. - I want to make a toast, to my brother Jack. - Yeah! - Brava! Brava! [speaking Italian] - Hey, I go to take a picture of four brothers. [chattering] [shouting] - Mama! Mama! [speaking Italian] [cheering] - Hey Vincenzo, when are we going to see you on Ed Sullivan Show? - Never. - Why you say never? - Oh no luck. Did you see the Bugs on the Ed Sullivan Show last Sunday? - It's not the Bugs mama, it's the Beatles. [laughing] [gasps] - Ooh. Wow! - I'm gonna get some more coffee. [chattering] - The point is, is that you can still do it Jack. - I could never be a real magician Joe, you know why? I have no discipline. - That's not true. - It is. - That's not true. You just lost your confidence that's all. You're the best, Jack. All you need is a little bit of practice, I'm telling you. - Yeah, just a little bit. - Come on. What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna be a waiter for the rest of your life? - So what's wrong with being a waiter? Sal was a waiter once, he did okay. - Yeah, but Sal got lucky. - So what am I, a black cat? Maybe I'll get lucky too. - And do what? Huh? You gonna open up a pizza stand? - Joe, pizzerias make a lot of money. It's a good business. - Jesus Christ, I can't believe you're giving up magic. - No honey, you have to learn to understand. It's very important for an Italian man to be able to take care of his family. You know? The woman take care of the home, the kids, the food, very important. - My mother was never a very good cook. Maybe that's why I never learned. I'm good with breakfast. Maybe you can teach me. - Of course. I will teach you how to cook real Italian food. - Is there anything else I need to know about Italian men? - Well, if you want to get along with an Italian man, never, never, never, never disagree with him in public. And then when you go home you tell him what you think. Capiche? - Capiche. - Brava. - Cara? - Hmm? - Go find the kids, huh. I want to stop by the restaurant make sure nobody's stealing anything from me. [speaking Italian] - Gioachino, we're taking off. - Oh yeah? Sal, thanks for the job, I appreciate it. But this time I want to make on my own. - Hey, you will make it on your own. But you're gonna work for me, ah? - All right.

I say fuck them. We should concentrate on our club act, try and get some gigs on the road instead of chasing rainbows. - I'm not chasing rainbows. I know where I'm going. I'm gonna make a record. - You want to make a record? Go make a record. Come on sweetheart, we're going. - Nicola, how many lunches today? - Eh, 65. - I made something very special for my baby. - Thank you, Papa. - Gioachino. - Hey. - Got a second? - Mm-hmm. - Good tips today? - Yeah, not bad. - Be sure you save your money, huh? You never know. Maybe have your own place one day. - I hope. - Maybe I teach you to manage the joint, huh? - That's great. - It'd be nice to have someone around here I can trust. You know, to look after the place. - Oh, Sal you can trust me. - Of course, huh? - I don't know, it's up to you. - Not bad, eh? - Yeah. - Like a little piece of chocolate. You taking her for a walk today, right? - Si. [speaking Italian] - Try to look with respect. She's a good girl. - I know. But I'm thinking about... - [speaking Italian] I take care of it, huh? - All right. ♪ [singing opera] ♪ - Ready? - Yeah, let's go. - Have a good time. - Amazing. How did you do that? - Mi ama. No, mi ama. Si, mi ama. No, mi ama. Si, mi ama. No, mi ama. Si, mi ama. No, mi ama. Si. Mi ama. [chattering] - Okay. - What kind of music do you like? - Um... Bobby Darrin. You know him? - Of course. - Yeah? - He's great. - Yeah. - You know why he's great? - Why? - Because he's Sicilian, that's why. - So do you like Italian music better than American? - I like them both. It depends on my mood, you know? Sometimes, when I feel lonely I listen to Italian songs. But next time, I'll call you. - I do not permit my daughter to go out with no junkie. - Angelo, he's not a junkie, okay, he's doing very good. He's clean. - He's a junkie! And junkies do not change! And I do not want him to hurt my little baby! - Angelo! Calmati, okay? Just listen to me Angelo, please. Okay? My brother's doing very good. Just give him a chance, huh? - You give him a chance with another girl. - I feel like a baby here. Whoa, whoa. See? Yes. Ai, yi, yi! [laughing] I love this tree. - I like Central Park. - Yeah. - It's special. So... Tell me about Sicily. Is it romantic? - Sicily. Sicily is beautiful. You have to see it to believe it. Maybe one day I'll take you. Ah... Don't move. Make a wish. You have to close your eyes when you make a wish. - So... - So, I had a wonderful time. - Me, too. We can go to the beach next Sunday. Yeah? Anna, I want to tell you something because I used to be-- - Hi, papa. - Buona sera, Angelo. - Where did you go? - We walked around Central Park. We had so much fun. Papa, did you know Jack is a magician? Jack, show papa one of your tricks. - I know all about his tricks, Anna. - Anna go inside, I want to talk to him. - Daddy, don't be angry, we didn't do anything wrong. - What did I just say to you? Go inside. - Good night, Jack. - Bye, Anna. - I'll see you tomorrow. - I'm sorry, Angelo. - Now you listen to me. In Naples where I come from when a young man wants to take a young girl out he asks the parents for permission. - We do the same thing in Sicily, but... - Your brother Salvatore knows exactly how I feel about this. - Everybody makes a mistake. It doesn't mean that we can't change. Even you can change. - I don't need to make a change, I'm not a junkie. - Don't call me junkie. I'm not a junkie anymore, okay? - Jack, I have nothing against you personally. I just want you to stay away from my daughter. Capiche? - Si, capiche. Okay, I'm sorry. I understand. - Gioachino, how you doing? How you been, huh? You look great. I didn't know, how long have you been on methadone? - Three months. You? - Little over a year now. But you got to be careful Gioachino, this shit sometimes is harder to quit than the real stuff. - Yeah, I know, I know. [speaking Italian] - So? [speaking Italian] This is the perfect opportunity. What do you say? - I don't know. Let me think about it, okay? - Jack. Come on in. It's so good to see you. - I was here in the neighborhood. - You look great. This color, you look so handsome in it. - Am I disturbing you? - No, no of course not. Just sit down. How did you know that I worked here? - Vincenzo told me. May I smoke a cigarette? - Sure, sure. Um... How's the job? - It's fine. It's fine. - Yeah? - So... what do you do here? - I'm like an intern here. The hours that I work go towards my degree. - So you're gonna be a shrink? - Not a shrink, Jack, a psychologist. - Why? - Why do I want to be a psychologist? I like to help people. It gives me satisfaction to help someone start to feel better about themselves. - Do you think people, they can change? I mean real change? - Absolutely. Why do you ask? - And... Also do you work with... with drug addicts? - Sometimes, yeah. - And what do you talk about? I mean... - I ask a lot of questions. I try to help them open up. I try to understand what's really hurting them. - They change? - Yeah. Let's talk about you, Jack. - Yeah. - Salvatore, I want you to meet a good friend of mine. Barry Freed. Barry, Salvatore. - Sal, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Barry. Please have a seat. - Thank you. - What can I get you to drink? - Give me a scotch, please. It's a wonderful place. - Gratzi. - Well, I bet the food's fantastic. - It's terrific. - So obviously you love what you do, my friend. - You got to love what you do. I'm in here 16 hours a day. You know, I started as a busboy, waiter, manager, cook, now I own the joint. - I'd like to start all over again. Maybe you'd give me a job here as a waiter. What do you think? - Okay, you're hired. Simone, give him an apron, huh? - Joe, Joe, take three aspirin and go to sleep. I'll be home in 15 minutes. - Barry, how long you know Rock? - Six hours. Met him in the barbershop today. - Yesterday, I took Josephina for a tune up. The doctor says she's in perfect health. Then he pulls me to the side and says, do you still have sex. I say, sure, two or three times a day I told him. - No, you're joking. - I swear to God. We have what they call oral sex. I stand on one side of the room and I say "Va fungool!" She stands on the other side and she says "Va fungool!"

Vincenzo, don't be a fool. You owe these guys nothing. Besides, you better think of yourself and your future wife, Carol. You're a certified shrink now, what's your opinion? - Salvatore, it's his decision. - Take the deal anyway, huh? - Just pour it, Nicola, I'm sure it's fine. - I'll have a Pellegrino please. - Hey, va fungool Pellegrino, huh? We're celebrating, huh? Come on, a toast. To a long and happy life together. - L'chaim. - To the wedding, huh. - A Catholic wedding? Why can't it be a Jewish wedding? Why does it have to be a Catholic wedding? - We couldn't make a decision, Mom, so we flipped a coin. - You what? You flipped a coin? You're making the decision of your life with a tail and a head? Oh, I never heard of such a thing. And you call yourself a psychologist? You know, you have no idea how much you're hurting me. - Mom, would you please not start that again? - First a stripper and now a Catholic wedding. - Mrs. Jacobs, do you want a Jewish wedding? - Yes, of course. - Honey we're having a Jewish wedding, that's it. Finito. - Shut up, Vincent. We are having a Catholic wedding. - Hey, Vinnie is sensible. Oh I love him, he's such a good boy. You know, you don't even deserve him. - Why do you always have to have it your way? - My way? You haven't done it my way since you were 3 years old. - Vincent, you come back here, you're a part of this. - Oh, hello, can I help you? [speaking Italian] - Oh, well, I don't speak Italian. But my son in law, he'll come and he'll help us. Vinnie, come and help us, please. This lady only speaks Italian. [speaking Italian] - She wants to know the price of the dress. - Oh, well, I'll be honest with you, Macy's sells this dress for $75. [speaking Italian] - What did she say? Too much? She looks like she's got more money than God and she's still bargaining? Where can you find such a deal? I told you that Macy's sells this dress for $75. - No, that's not true. Macy's sells this for $45 dollars. - All right you can have it for $50. - $40. - $45. - $40. - 40, take it already, before you give me an ulcer. - Mother, would you listen to me? - What do you want?

What's more important than girls, huh? Oh marone, did you see the bazooms on the bridesmaid? Ooh, if I was single, I would do a job on her, she'd be singing Aida. - You better watch out there, you're a married man. Did you forget? - I may be married but I'm not blind. - I got to tell you something Sal. I've been drafted. - Drafted? Son of a bitch. You're sure? - Yeah.
