How easy? This easy. You smell a little funky. Please. You love my little funky ass and you know this. Yeah, I do. Now could you please hurry? EMERY: Ladies and gentlemen. Tonight is an exciting evening. I'm very proud to add yet another restaurant to Atlanta's A-list of fine dining. And I'm truly honored that each and every one of you chose to join us tonight in celebration. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for coming. Now, my mother taught me that privilege is a privilege. So in homage to her, I declare that for the life of this restaurant, 5% of our revenue'll be donated to the Youth Advocacy Center. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Now this is a project which is nearest and dearest to my wife's heart. So if I may, I'd like to introduce my wife to you. The very beautiful, the very sexy, my baby... Mrs. Constance Simms. [DINERS CHATTERING, MUSIC PLAYING] EMERY: Come on now. Tell me I made you proud. MAN: Okay, if I have to. Listen... you snatched up that Niske Lake property just in time. If I'd had my ear to the ground, maybe you and I both would've made a killing. Or better yet, just me. Maybe next time. Hey, excuse me. Enjoy, ladies. How you doing tonight? What's going on? We have uninvited guests. A lot of shit in here. What is this? WOMAN: Look at this sad plan... EMERY: Are we finding anything interesting? Mr. Simms. That's me. I'm Detective Pierce, this is my partner, Detective Morgan. Atlanta Police Department. Nice office. Thank you. I find it comfortable. I'm Raymond Wallace, Mr. Simm's attorney. What is this about? PIERCE: Well, we were hoping to ask your client some questions, like if he knew a Kenneth Stroud. Stroud. No, I'm sorry. That name doesn't ring a bell. Well, you know what? Don't worry about it. You know that happens to me all the time. I never remember names. But I always good with faces. What about that? Huh? Look familiar? Wow. Yeah. He's dead. Indeed he is. Well, that look familiar to you? No. Not really. No? Or not really? No, detective. We found a phone next to the dead guy. And it had your number in the recent call list. Well, that's interesting, detective. But, uh, isn't it possible that he could have just called the wrong number? Incoming recent calls. I'm sorry, did I forget that? Isn't it just as possible that I could have called the wrong number? Is my client being charged with the crime, detective? No, he is not. We're just trying to get some questions answered. You know, trying to get some clarity here, right? Oh, and I'm one who does appreciate clarity. But detectives, I apologize. I can't help you with this matter. Maybe you can help us by telling us where you... Uh, we apologize for interrupting your lovely party. We thank you for your time, Mr. Simms. My pleasure. But I do need to attend to my guests, so if on your way out, you could leave me my pen and take these pictures, I'd appreciate that. Yes, of course. Thanks. Mr. Wallace. BRANDON: Hey... what was that all about? We need to talk. CONNIE: Emery, you're not even listening. Oh, Connie, I am listening to you. I'm just tired, so please don't start. Well, if your little 5% pledge had really come from your heart, we'd be having a different conversation. Baby, what is the problem here? This could work out in your favor. Or it could backfire. Now wait. Just listen to me. The restaurant does well, that's a sizable donation for your cause. So what? You use the kids and the youth center to cast yourself in a better light? Connie. You're panicking. Don't patronize me, Emery. I know the police came to visit you tonight. You want to tell me what that's all about? Hmm? Yeah. Goodnight. [CAR ALARM BEEPS] Huh. Oh, wow. Oh, Ray, you are stupid. [CAR HOOD POPS] [ENGINE REVS] Excuse me, sweetheart. This might sound a little corny, but, uh... Yeah. I know. You know me from someplace. Other night. At your restaurant. Yeah, yeah, that's right. At the opening. Well, I don't think we ever got formally introduced now, did we? Allannah James. Emery Simms. So talk to me. How is it that we ended up running into each other twice in one week, huh? I was interviewing for a position at the tennis club. And as for the restaurant, well, you know... Ain't a party in Atlanta I can't get into. Oh, is that right? That's right. Trust me. Okay. Okay. I think I like your little styling, Miss Thing. That's good. Yeah, I think I like that a lot. Well, here we are. Thank you. You're welcome. Wait a minute. Just in case you ever find yourself in need again. Thank you... again. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. Russell's on Line 2. I rescheduled lunch with Aaron for next week, and there's an urgent message from the printer regarding the programs. Thanks, Anna. He has another function that evening. There's no way he'll make both. Russell, these are underprivileged kids who have managed to refocus their anger into something constructive. Now surely the mayor can take the time to honor that kind of dedication and commitment. It's a recital, Constance. It's an exhibition. Say what you're not saying, Russ. It's election year, sweetheart and your husband's business dealings don't exactly bring pride to your family name. I am not my husband. And he has nothing to do with the center. Right, 5% donations aside, of course. Thank you. PIERCE: Cell phone ID's are in. And? And seems as though our Mr. Stroud was a busy bee. He's been in touch with everyone from the big house to the boys on Capitol Hill. Well, were the calls spread out or made all on the same day? It looks like all on the same day, except for two... Simms and a Mark Reyes, a numbers guy for the Congressman. Hmm, let me see that. Um, this coffee is shitty. Well, the duration of the call to Simms was 5 minutes and some change. So much for it being a wrong number. Time for a field trip. Let's roll. WOMAN: but then, I knew... Morning. What the hell was that? Payback. Latrice is not happy about your late night creeping. First of all, nobody is creeping. So she's already getting freaked out over this whole living situation. You got to be a little more considerate. You know, this ain't... Yeah, yeah, I know. This ain't Greenville. Got it. Help me with this necklace, smart ass. You know I got more assets than my ass, you know. Well, then use them to help you get to the bus station. I'm running late. Pick up your hair. You know, two in a bed, riding on the bus. You sure this ain't Greenville? You are so stupid. WOMAN: Package for you, Mr. Simms. EMERY: Oh, thank you, Jamie. Oh, wow. Oh, no, she didn't. [PHONE RINGS] This is Allannah James. How can I help you? Well, you can help me understand how a little paperweight can have such a large impact. Did you like it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I like it a lot. Thank you. You're welcome. Emery? Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm here. Hey, listen. I want you to have dinner with me tonight. Okay, now why would I want to do that? Well, why wouldn't you do that? I don't know. Press says you a dangerous man. You don't strike me as the type of woman who scares easily. I don't. Baby, just have dinner with me. Sheila's, downtown. It's on Ponce. Parking's in the rear. I'll make the reservation. Hey, man. What up, player? Yo... I'm about to take a ride so I don't have to worry about anything, right? I'm the manager, right? You got this. Then let me manage, you control freak. Hey, hey. My bad. My bad. I guess old habits die hard. Handle your business, player. Hey, wait, wait. Thank you, my brother. I'm with you tonight, all right? You're with me? Got it. All right. Make that money, player. Come on, now. You do look very nice tonight. Thank you... again. [BOTH CHUCKLING] [ALLANNAH CLEARS THROAT] What was that? Come on now. Speak up. You know this could be very, very wrong. Meaning? Meaning, my mama didn't raise me like this. Emery, you are very much a married man, and I don't want you thinking of me in that way. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. It's a little too late for that. Besides, your mama can't be too mad at us. We're just having dinner together, right? Hm? EMERY: Well, hey baby. Hey. I didn't think you'd still be up. Just trying to get a jump start on tomorrow. What about you? It's late. Yeah, yeah, I know it is, baby, I know. But, uh, listen, we had a really good turnout at the restaurant tonight. Despite the bad press, the people still showed up. Good for you. A lot of my heavy hitters have backed out of even attending the exhibition. Without them, no funding. Connie, I'm sorry. I really thought they'd leave you and the center out of all this. Yeah...

I was not tripping. But you know what? It was as long as we had our own space and you respected the fact that folks have got to get some sleep around here. But you know what?

You know, there ought to be a law against somebody being this good. I did my homework on that number you found over at Stroud's place. What'd you come up with? It's an offshore account. Any money in it? How does half a million dollars sound? Ooh, that's good. Thought so. And the bulk of it was wired over in stock transactions. Okay, how about if you run the stock transactions, find out which companies he invested in, for how much. Can you do that? Okay. You know what, I think I see where you going with that. Be right back. I'm getting on it. Hey, Tamika. Aw, shit. So... what do you think? Allannah, you are kidding me. GWEN: Hello. ALLANNAH: You like it? Well, girl, you know, we're still working some things out. You know, like the security gate buzzer keeps breaking and we're still figuring out our décor, but you know... We? Um, you sound like you're setting up house with this man. Are you thirsty? What you got? Uhh, orange juice, Coke... or wine. Ooh, wine. Yeah, that's what I thought. Got to be old money, right? What do you mean? Lanna, look at this place. This can't just be restaurant money. What difference does it make? It's temporary. Here. Small hole in the condom, and it doesn't have to be. Gwenie, you're the one who said this ain't Greenville anymore. Right? Tell me you haven't thought about it. Drink your drink. You're much more fun when you're buzzed. REYES: Hey, it's Reyes. I'm getting out of town. But I may know where to get some extra cash before I go. Come on, B, you got to let it go, man. I'll give you another chance to lose again. Come on now, Emery. You know I let you win so you can look good in front of your little Bourgeoisie friends. Okay, whatever, player. Yo, what's that? This is Reyes. The motherfucker wants some money. I'm sorry, man, but you've got to give the guy points for creativity. He puts a Swiss bank account number on the back of a Swiss Alps postcard? That's balls. B, this shit right here means he's gonna talk. He talks, he loses everything. Look... He was there that night, all right? How's he gonna explain that? The only way he can get you, the only way, is if you let him. Nah, man. Know what, I'll just pay him off. I'll give him some money, make it go away forever. Sometimes I think you got too much damn money. If you just want to give it away, shit, give me some. You really don't think I should just pay him off? Hell no. As a matter of fact, give me the fucking postcard. [TEARS POSTCARD] Go on. All right? Don't sweat it. All right. All right, it's done. [GIRLS GIGGLING] ALLANNAH: You're lying.

Emery! Get him out of here! I ain't feel that, pretty boy. You just stay the fuck away from Allannah! What in the hell are you doing here, Derrick? This is a phat crib, Allannah. They do a credit check on you? How did you get this address? You know what's funny? Just the other day you crying broke and... but today you can afford all this. It's a friend's. I had a talk with that friend. What kind of talk? Man-to-man talk. You better not have hurt him. He got you thinking brand-new, don't he? Get your hands off me, boy. I want in. I want in on the con. This is not about the money. It's always about the money. This is different. Why? Dude got you laced? You're no more than another piece of ass for him up here. You on-call booty. Okay, Allannah? Just more decoration for his condo. I love him. I love him in a way that I will never love you. You're not my husband anymore. We're not partners in the life anymore. Which means... I don't owe you shit. You always did have too much mouth. Now you owe me money. And I'm gonna get it out your ass or your pocket but either way, I'm gonna get my money. And you're gonna pay me for as long as I say you will. Here you go. I got you a little ice pack for that. Baby, it's fine. Quit trying to be brave and take it. Connie, look, I don't need it. Are you listening to me? It's gonna swell... This is just a little cut, so let it go. Connie. Baby, I can't do this tonight. Do what, Emery? What? Some man attacks you out of the clear blue and I'm the only concerned one in the room. Baby, I told you. He didn't attack me. He just punched me. I walked up from behind him so he would've hit anybody. What if he comes back? He won't. How do you know? Because he has no reason to. You don't even know why he came this time, Emery. Connie, some punk came off the street making a bunch of noise. He could've been drunk, he could've been high. For all I know he was a little off. But the bottom line is I'm fine. So let's just drop it. You know what? I'm so sick and tired of trying to be a wife to a man who doesn't even wanna be a husband. Connie, come on. Do you have to control everything? Even the way I love you? If it's not your way, then hell with it. Even with the goddamn ice pack. I said I was sorry. Would you stop apologizing? I'm getting so sick of your apologies. After the 100th time, they start to lose a little meaning. Woman, what do you want me to do? I want you to stop! Just stop doing things that you're gonna have to be sorry for later. Just... stop.

You know, uh, get bigger companies, and for that the brother would need a lot more cash. Yeah. That is where Simms comes in. Let me ask you a question. What's one of the biggest corporations in America? Don't say Microsoft. Federal government? Bingo. So you have a corrupt numbers guy working out of a congressman's office. How much information do you think he could give you? Oh, so you're saying Reyes was to supply Stroud with information for Simms. So he could buy into a subsidized government company. Exactly.

Damn, so this is how you spend your days off, huh? Nope. Normally I'm doing overtime for my pain-in-the-ass boss. You got jokes, huh? Ha ha. That ain't funny, bro. Here you go. What the hell you want me to do with that? No spectators, man. Get to work. You can start right there. Oh, you tripping. You know that, right? Yep. What the hell is all this mess anyway? Trash or treasure, my brother. Today's mission is to figure out which. EMERY: Oh, hell, no. This isn't what I think it... Aw, I thought you burned this a long time... What are you doing holding on to this, man? Memories, baby. '87. Oh, wait a minute. Hey, bro. You was one funny-looking cat back in the day. Damn. Yeah, they say we looked just alike then. Yeah, whatever. See, that is why you stayed a virgin in school. That's all right. That's all right. EMERY: Wow. Look at that. Oh, Connie. It's all under control now, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, everything's cool. Allannah's going to the clinic on Monday, so. You going? Nah. Hell, no. She doesn't want me to go. Oh, you don't wanna go anyway, man. Abortions don't always solve the problem. What? Man, we all got one who got away. Who? Why you all up in my Kool-Aid for, player? Come on now, I don't tell you everything. Aw, now, see that's bullshit. I tell you all my damn business. But we know how sensitive you are. You act like a little punk sometimes. Whatever with you. Hey, B. This shit's getting crazy, man. I don't know, man, I just... I'm looking for peace, you know what I'm saying? From Reyes, from Allannah. I mean, I just need some damn peace. Hey, look, if the guy's causing you that much trouble $250,000 for your peace of mind, maybe you should just pay him off. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I should. Hey, look... I'm gonna bounce. Where you going? I'm gonna go home. You just gonna bail on me like that. Hell, yeah. Watch. See. I knew you was just about yourself. It's all right. It's nice. What's nice, baby? Just making some final decisions on pieces for the exhibition. Yeah? Mm-hm. I have a piece. You do? Yeah, I do. Roses are red Ooh, this is original. Violets are blue Mm-hm. And I'm a terrible poet Oh, you got that right. But in spite of everything, Connie... know that I love you. Aww. Hey. Hi. I didn't do it. Emery... I know. I know that you're not only with me for sex. I know that, and the baby is proof of that. And it's worth more than the cost of an abortion. I'm gonna say this to you one time. You cannot roll with the big dogs, so don't even try playing this bullshit-ass game with me. Emery, I rolled around with the biggest dog of them all. You don't scare me. You get your little trifling ass out of my condo, you hear me? As of right now, you are out of my life. You never fucking existed. Emery. Emery, I'm sorry. Goodbye, Allannah. Emery! Emery, baby, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying. Emery! ALLANNAH: I'm not a bad person. I'm not even a mean person. Oh, Em. Because even with what you think you know about me, you don't really "know me" know me. You know, and no one says that you have to trust me. It would make things a lot easier for both of us if you could. Because I don't really want to hurt anybody. And I don't wanna be hurt either. I'm gonna be a mother now. I'm gonna be a mom. And that affects... both of us. This child... This child, it was conceived in love. Now, you may not have any love for it, but I do. But that doesn't mean that does not mean that you get to walk away. You have as much responsibility in this as I do. You really can make things a lot easier for all of us. Senator, gentlemen, I apologize for being late. Not a problem. Have a seat. ALLANNAH: Constance. I think it's time we were women about this. Baby, what are you doing? Figure it out. Connie, why are you packing? I'm not going to ask what I did, because this is so not about me. This is about you and your "God amongst mortals" mentality. Thinking you can do whatever you want and get away with it. Well, you can't, Emery. Okay, whoa, whoa. Slow down for a minute. Baby, talk to me. What happened? Why don't you ask your little girlfriend? We really bonded. Right after she lured me to Piedmont Park. To share your good news. It's rather apropos that a bastard should father one. No, I don't wanna hear shit. It wasn't enough for you to bang some little gold-digging hood rat. Do you know that she asked me for money? And I gave it to her. I gave her a check for $100 grand. Do you want to know why I paid her? Because she must have something that I don't have for you to get her pregnant. The one thing that you never agreed to do with me. Shit! Connie... Okay, all right. Let me help you. No, don't! Baby, just listen to me. Why? So you can deny it? Come on, Emery. Deny it. Do some damage control. Put a good spin on it. She's not pregnant, Connie. Fuck you. Where the fuck you going, huh? Derrick, stop it! I'm here for my cut! Get away from me, you fucking drunk. I don't give a shit! Now, where is it? I told you, I need more time. Well, you out of time. Get your ass in there. You're hurting me. Stop it. I'm not playing with you, Allannah. I want my money! What? What? Okay, stop it. Okay? Yeah, see, that pretty boy don't know how you like it. But I do, right? You're right. You're absolutely right. You're so good. That's right. Hell, yeah. I see this. That's the Allannah I know. Yeah. Remember that? That's what I'm talking about though. This is better than money, right? Say it. Okay. It's better than money. You dirty bitch. MORGAN: You know why I don't like gangsters? Why? Because they think they can bullshit their way out of anything. Even murder. Yo, this ain't on me. I ain't the dude you need to be drilling. MORGAN: What about those? Get this shit out of here. I ain't trying to see her like that. Aw, what's the matter? You're not proud of your handiwork? EMERY: I'm telling you, she was very much alive when I left. And you certainly knew how alive she could get, huh, Mr. Simms? Try to display some tact, detective. Need I remind you we are conducting a homicide investigation, not a beauty pageant. Therefore the questions tend to be a bit more difficult. Detective, she was alive. When I left. Before you left. What about before you left, Mr. Simms? DERRICK: We was talking. MORGAN: About what? About our relationship. Trying to patch things up. I was trying to break things off with her, all right? Like her clothing. That's why they were ripped, right? I don't know nothing about that. So, you didn't rip her clothes? No, that's not why it was ripped. You positive? Maybe she ripped her own clothes. I don't know. How? When I walked in that house they were having sex together. So you got jealous. You got angry. Shit happens. So what? I got angry. You're right. But that doesn't mean I killed anybody. EMERY: Did you really think you could play me, Allannah? The two of you better get up and get the fuck out of my place right now. No, baby. It's not what you think. It's not what I think? I think he's trying to fuck you, that's what I think, Allannah. Yeah it is what you think. I am fucking her. No, shut up! I don't want to hear any sorry excuses. You just give me my keys, that check, and get the fuck out! Check? What check? Look here, little man. You already tried to come at me once. You wanna make that shit happen again? You little soft punching motherfucker. What check? Do something. You know what? Stop it, both of you. Derrick, why don't we just leave? You might wanna listen to your girlfriend. But you know what? You ain't going nowhere till I get my money. Where's my money, Allannah? No, hey, nothing. DERRICK: Hey. That check, motherfucker. Now say something. You little backstabbing... Yeah, see, I owed you that. Now, raise up and get... She ran out of the house on me. Did you catch her? No, I didn't. She was long gone. Look, I'm telling you, I went home and called my accountant so I could stop payment on that check. That is it! Look, we was chilling, okay? All right? Just catching up on some things. The next thing I know, dude come rushing in. Simms? Yeah, Simms. He gonna ask us to leave his spot. Okay, I respect that. It's yours. I'm gonna dip out. But then he gonna punch me? You little backstabbing little bitch. Yeah, see I owed you that one. Now... Fuck you talking about huh? MORGAN: What happened to Allannah? I don't know what happened to Allannah. Okay? Last time I saw her, she ran out the condo. You murdered her in the condo. Last time I saw her, she was alive when she left the condo. Sit down. Sit the fuck down! And y'all gonna swarm on me. All right? Pull my car over and pull me down here. That's what happened. But you admit that you were trying to con Simms out of the money. It wasn't even about Simms. What about the knife? What about it? It had your prints on it, Derrick. What's happening? Why is he leaving? PIERCE: We can't hold him, Miss Caplan. Not enough evidence. Relax. GWEN: Why? Yo, Simms! You think I'm gonna burn for you? You killed my wife. You're a dead motherfucker, do you hear me? A rich, dead motherfucker! Emery, we should leave. Yeah. Connie. Brandon. What could I have done? Why weren't you there for him? [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] I'm here. I'm trying. EMERY: Connie. You okay? [CRYING] Hey, Brandon. Look, Connie, I know a lot has happened. Why don't we skip this part? I'm afraid if we do, there's nothing to stop you from jumping right back in that car and driving off for good. Emery, I haven't taken my bags out of the car, and we have an event tonight. An event? The exhibition at the youth center? Yeah, I know. You forgot. I'm the director of the center, Emery. I have to go. I'll lay out your tux. Connie, I didn't do it. I know. I'm no saint, Emery. It's just not your style and the truth is... I just don't care anymore. You try to be a good person, a good wife. Support your husband, make him wanna come home. Make him proud to have you on his arm. But some days it gets hard to smile through the bullshit. But you do. You just do it. For 11 years, you find ways to make it work. And then suddenly... you're just not enough. And you start to lose control. You start having these sick thoughts. And sooner or later... you're the psycho in the scenario. Emery... would you bring my bags in? Please? CONNIE: Emery. Yeah. What's up, baby? What are you doing? Nothing, nothing. I thought I left one of your bags in the car, you know, I just went to go check. Well, I need you to hurry. I don't wanna be late. Connie... why'd you come back so soon? I put a lot of work into this marriage, and this is my home. I've earned my place. I wasn't gonna let anyone take that away from me. Look, baby. I don't think I'm gonna go. No one's coming after you. The police are satisfied. Why don't we just move on? Baby, I just need you to give me tonight, all right? Look, I need a second to come down off of all this, you know what I'm saying? Fine. EMERY: What the fuck? Oh, shit. Fuck! [CAR ALARM BLIPS] BRANDON: Yo, yo, what's up? EMERY: What's up, B? What's the matter with you, man? Brandon, you're gonna think I've lost my mind. Well, I thought that years ago. All right, man. Go ahead. Speak on. I think Connie may have hurt Allannah, man. Want a beer, man? Hey, you hear what I just said to you? Come on, now. What makes you think Connie would be some kind of murderer? Don't even say it like that. It's a little late to get squeamish. Listen, it's just the things she's been saying to me lately... I've never heard that woman talk like that, ever. That's some heavy accusation off of some words, man. So what. What are you thinking about doing? I don't know. I don't know what the fuck to do, man. Look, I don't know if she really did it, but if she did, think about it Brandon, it would be my fault. I couldn't blame her for it. But you tell me, how do I live with a woman who would do some crazy shit like that? Huh? Okay, look. I think I'm gonna need something heavier to drink if we're gonna have this type of conversation. Come on, B, you're my boy, and I need you. Tell me something. Tell me I'm overreacting. Something. You are so fucking stupid. Just look at you, man. Everything you've done. Everything you have in your life, somebody gave it to you. Your money. Inherited, not earned. Your business. You don't even know how to run, I do it. Your wife. The best thing that ever happened to you. You fucking couldn't even get that on your own! You had to steal her from me. What the fuck are you talking about? You know, I'm glad you asked me that, motherfucker. I'm about to get it back. Now, you listen to me, you sorry little motherfucker. Your little fucking plan has got a hole in it. You know why? Because Connie, she's my wife! We are still together, and we are gonna stay together. Believe that! You always walk around here like you're so much better than everyone else. You are no saint, Emery. You killed Stroud without a second thought and covered it. And you killed Allannah. Derrick's gonna take the fall for that because that's they way you set it up. If you come near me or my wife, if I ever see you again I swear before God, you are a dead man. Is that right? Why wait that long? Wait! You want to kill me? How many people you think saw you come in here? Two or three maybe? You ever fuck with me again, I will kill you. Believe that! Fuck! [APPLAUSE] To our esteemed mayor and other distinguished guests I want to thank you, thank you so much for sharing this extraordinary evening. Ladies and gentlemen, our next artist, M'Kai Marks. I present you with my manhood My man's hood My cloak of detachment that Shows my face as I walk on Mistakenly, thinking I could do it alone It's only now that I see That without you I'm simply without So about is the face I turn Away from the madness that I Learned to accept as true Dropping my hood Revealing the man Newly subdued By renewed devotion to you Thank you. You got nothing on me. Emery's under arrest. I've cleared myself. Back off. [EMERY AND POLICE SHOUTING] EMERY: Ray! Ray! You can't do this to me. I didn't kill anybody, you know this. I cleared myself. Baby, this is a mistake. I promise you that. I promise you. You know you got the wrong man. [SIRENS BLARING FAINTLY] INMATE 1: Hey, boy, let me get some of that brown sugar. INMATE 2: Look at this pretty motherfucker. Baby...? Nah, baby, what the hell is this? Connie, you don't want a divorce, do you? There are ways to do this without you, Emery. Baby, listen to me. I told you I did not kill that woman. You have to believe that. I need to move on, Emery. Connie, no, don't do this to me. Don't do this to us. Sign the fucking papers, Emery. Just sign them. Baby, what are you doing? [PEN SCRATCHING, CHAINS CLANGING] Woman, you used to believe in me. Belief is intangible, Emery. Don't pretend you know anything about it. I stopped believing your conspiracy theories right after they found the box cutter. Box cutter? What are you talking about a box cutter? Goodbye, Emery. Connie, I don't know anything...
