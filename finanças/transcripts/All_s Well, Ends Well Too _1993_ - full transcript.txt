It's a call from my sister; I guess she is calling me to visit the zoo. I am pretty and kind, how can you beat a beauty like me? I have no money, but... You can sell me to brothel. I do think so.

Come on, have some tea first. Mom! Come on, - take some tea first. - Just leave this thing to the maid. No, I want to apologize to you two. So you were born, we didn't get your consent beforehand. I know you, you hate me, that's true, right? Forget it, mom. Mom, stop fooling us. I am wrong, I should not fight. I know it's wrong, mom. You know it now? You know it? So why should I talk to you like this? Don't get angry, mom. You always fight. You like a bowl of rice! And you, except gambling, you know nothing, I prefer having barbecue pork as daughter. So, both of us will be a dish of "barbecue pork with rice". A bowl of rice with barbecue pork. From now on, just eat and sleep. I won't give you a penny. Don't do this to me, mom. I wanna quit gambling. Can you make it? I can do it. If you don't believe it. Let's bet on it. You shit head, you are rubbish! Ok, I will leave you to your husband. I won't take care of you anymore. Husband? I have received the letter from my future-son-in-law for a long time. He is coming from Kai-fung to lok-Yung, but it's taken a month! Husband? Honey, I open a bank specially for you. And this credit card is for you. You can draw the cash 24 hours a day. So you can gamble at any time you like. Hubby! Hubby... Aunt, aunt, may I ask... Ask? You want to beg, right? Leave me alone.

What's the matter with you? I am fine, you are the best friend of mine. Yes. Hey, why don't we arrange the marriage of our coming children? Great idea, let's make an oath now. Look at them! If they are boys, let them be buddies. If they are girls, let them be sisters. If one boy and one girl, let them marry. It's a deal, if any of us deny this oath, the son will have no bottom, the daughter will have one more bottom. You have no bottom! Don't you eat rice? How dare you! Ka sing, your family is the richest family of the world. Why are you that poor now? Yes, my family in Kai-fung used to be the richest one. We had thousands miles of field, and thousands of houses. Our villa was as beautiful as a palace. I lived in a deluxe life! We had over 3000 guests living with us & 500 servants served us. Precious dishes were common in diet. I was born is such a lucky family! What a world, sweet world! You shouldn't be that poor! But it's changed! Last month, my dad failed in his business, he went into bankruptcy. Later, he passed away. Then, my family was getting poor. Now, my home is empty, I have nothing valuable left. I checked from my bank account... Only 30 million taels of gold are left. Master sing. But, the fate is fooling me again. After the close down of bank cc, I have nothing left. What a poor story of mine, my honey! Shut up, I won't admit you to be my husband. - I won't take him as my wife. - Your husband, impossible! You idiot! Mom, since he has shown up, gut fainted twice. If she married him, she will die soon. We won't accept a poor relative like you. Anyway, you are not our relative, get lost now. How dare you! Kneel down! My dear son-in-law, I don't mean you. It's your parents who should decide your marriage. Marry gut 3 days later; You'll be adopted into our chow's family. Damn it, I won't marry him. If you refuse, you can never marry again. I have long been a widow. Let me marry him. Why don't you help? If he marries my mom, he will be my dad. Hubby, are you tired? I am not. Let's eat now. I've prepared some special dish for you. See, the dishes are your favorite. I love it. Fried rice. I am satisfied. Let's dine now. Dad, it's the beginning of the month. Give my some pocket money please. Thank you. Don't waste it! How poor am I? Kidding! You! Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I am leaving now... I am leaving! Don't go, my dear brother-in-law. I will marry my sister to you tomorrow. I will pay you too. It's deal. Stop! Please come down. He is adopted. Hey, change it, hurry up. I don't want to marry a beggar. If you don't, he will be our dad. So we will have poor life! Don't worry. I will teach him a lesson. So he will obey you for the rest of life! What a happy day! Be careful, sir. This fool is willing to marry gut chow, he must be idiot! He will be bullied by his brother-in-law! - Yeah... - Bull shit! He is a lucky guy! You deserve it. Walk slowl? Do you want to enter the bridal chamber now? Go out, let's discuss something. You are one of our family now. You are the son-in-law of chow's family, so you'd listen to us. You should change your surname to chow from now on. And you should be named chow, chow chow is your new name. Chow chow? It's easy to be remembered, why don't you thank my brother? Save it. Sister, spread your legs, be quick. You'd not spread like this. Stand and spread your legs. Sorry, I think it's bedtime. Go under your wife's legs, you'd listen to your wife forever. Come on! No, how can I face the others? Are you refusing? No. Ok, but... Are you civilized? Ok, I will give you an 1q test. What kind of beast will ask "why why" when seeing people? - Parrot. - No, it's turtle! It's pig! Pig? Why? Why? You are the beast who asks "why why" when seeing people. Turtle... You are quite wise. Move it out! Now, it's a test of your guts. If you can step through the fire basins, you needn't go under her legs. Hurry up! I am tired. - Hold it! - Help. Good! So what? You are wearing the fireproof shoes. You are tricky! I want you to go under her legs now. No! I won't do it. Hurry u p. - Now! You can't insult the civilized scholar! Hurry up...

Beauty, sleep earlier tonight. I'll come early tomorrow morning to pick you up for your wedding. Damn you! Don't you want to marry me? I will force you to do so. Ko yuen, come in. Young master. Gather the buddies from the martial arts school. Surround this house. Yes sir! If any one escapes from this house, you will be seriously punished. See you, my dear father-in-law. See you, my honey. Copper feel... Dad, what shall we do? I want to go to sleep. There is no time for you to sleep. You know my bad habit. When I am nervous, I will feel sleepy. Don't stop my way upstairs. I can stand no more. Go that way, go! Now, it's time for our fantastic show. Any one wishes to help me? Mister... You are a volunteer. Come on... No, mister... Cut the crap, come on... This is a new hairstyle, which I have learnt from Hong Kong. Good! It's post modern. Any one wants a try? Oh my hair. But, I come for my miss. Miss what? The underwear? What kind of underwear? I wear the same kind of underwear of my miss. Oh, Mr. big eyes. Miss is forced to marry a villain. Villain? She is waiting for you in her room. Stay one night with her. May be, you will find some ways to save her. Whole night? Yes, I have prepared the sedan-chair for you. I want to buy something first. Man, do you have any rubber... Yes! Extra big size please. Why do you buy rubber... Oh, you have sedan-chair sick. So I have to buy a large rubber bag. What are you doing? She is the friend of my miss, she comes to be the bridesmaid. Why is she vomiting? She is pregnant! A pregnant woman to be a bridesmaid? It's custom of our hometown. Don't block the way. It's strange. Hey, the poor guy can't take the sedan-chair! Should I give you some pills to stop your headache? Sit down! Sit dow? Miss... Master, what do you want? Snow white refuses to marry him. So, I want to shave and make up so as to take her place tomorrow. But, if chow lung is so crazy that... Then my ass would... Would be ruined by him! It doesn't matter, you are so old. Bull shit! Who is she? Oh, Oh, maste? Where did you get such beauty? You are smart! You have got the same idea as mine. You want to take this beauty to substitute the bride! - No! - Cut the crap! Tell miss the good news now, asks her not to worry any more. I don't mean it. Go, she is shouting for help now! Go! I shouldn't have such dirty thought! I pay so much to get this beauty, it's of no reason to benefit chow lung like this! I have to do some dirty things this time. I want to do with this girl now. Girl, I want to take chow tung's advantage. You will have a baby of mine soon. Then I will tell him the truth after 18 years. So as to make him crazy! Be careful! When he knows that he has raised a son of mine for 18 years, he would be crazy! Don't be nervous! Don't fall asleep. Shut u? I'm powerful! Don't panic! You wolf! You will lose your virgin sooner or later. Now, I will show you the process of losing your virgin. I am not wolf! You will see the wolf tomorrow! Woo, you are active! Great! Come 0? You are scared by a simple hairpin! Mister here is too dangerous. You'd better leave, don't come back until tomorrow morning. Leave your miss to me. Cut the crap! Mr. big eyes. Don't cry, Mr. big eyes. If you cry, I'll feel more excited. Chow tung wants to marry me. Instead of being raped by him, I prefer giving you my most precious thing. Don't you mind this? I don't think so. Let's drink the wine first. What are you doing? After this wine. We will reach a happy stage. Our soul and mind will mix together, to enjoy the happiest time. Then the poison will function. We will be so painful! Bleeding! In order to avoid the revenge of chow tung, I don't want him to separate our corpses, so before the poison works, let's chop each other. Then, burn ourselves, we'll become ash at last. Isn't it romantic? Don't be that impulsive! Then, we mix together after that, no one can separate us again. It's a great idea. There are many exciting things in this world, which you've never tried. Sa? Also... I think you don't want to die if you try any of it. Let's hold tightly. Eyes to eyes. Maybe, you will blame me of forcing you at the first time. But you will urge for it for the second time, come on. Where can you escape? Are you still sleeping? Damn it! It's a mistake, go up there. Hurry up! You said you wanted me instead of my miss, why don't you take me? I am not that kind of person! I emphasize righteousness and courtesy. I have promised to marry your miss. I won't change my mind within a short period. But after that... I will take you as concubine. Wait for me! Get lost! Take her back! No... Don't be that rude. Be careful! Chase after them now! Hurry up... I am the bridegroom! How happy am I! There is romantic lighting. Hel? Luckily I have the safety seat belt. Help... What kind of monster are you? A woman with beard! Bride robbing, your honour! You mean you? A bride with beard? Honey, you are tied all night, because I don't want you to disturb my mom. Take the bride's dress first. After my mom wakes up, we can have the wedding ceremony. Don't worry; I won't push you to do anything. I won't rape you. Let's take 3 months as pre-marriage period. After that, we can do that without any embarrassment. I am the most understanding person in the world. Brother, there are two cops who want to arrest you. Arrest me? They want you to take the statement. They are going to sue you of kidnapping, unlawful detention. Severe sex disturbance, sexual discrimination. You want to put me to jail? Take care of your future sister-in-law. How dare you! Brother courted a gay. Who are you? I am David copper feel. Can you imagine your future sister-in-law is a man? Why I did so is because... I want to court you! Court! Corrup... Tion! Thank you for taking care of my daughter's matter. I am your good friend, I should help you. By the way, you have brought your evidence here. Have the tea please ok. How dare you do this in my territory? Arrest him. Your honour, Mr. chow brought you many important evidence. Finish it as soon as possible, I am in a hurry. Now, the evidence is enough, this case is settled. Mr. chow is a man of piety. Therefore, chow tung is acquitted. Withdraw court. Your honour, I am the best friend of yours. This is court, we'd forget friendship but justice. Only evidence counts. Your evidence is not enough. Then I can add some more. Save it, it's come to an end. Why not next time? Be smart next time, give more evidence. Dear father-in-law. Why don't you dress up yourself, and participate our wedding party? - That's right... - Now, I am not going to sue chow tung anymore. Well, let's go to have tea now. I want to sue you, you corrupted judge I want to sue youl! You would be in great trouble! Let's see who would be in trouble! What are you doing? Hey, stop! What's the matter? You are framing the officials. Give him a severe penalty of 70 strikes. How dare you! Just strike him 30 times. 30, that's correct. No, add 30 more, make it total, 100.
