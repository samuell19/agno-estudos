[indistinct chatter] ADAPTED FROM THE WORLD OF TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT DAY BY MARCHELLA FP [phone ringing] [siren wailing] [slams doors] [dramatic music playing] [siren continues wailing] A train accident in Bintaro! Dozens injured! Move! Take them to wards three and four, now! Come on. Hurry! [people clamoring] Hurry! Go on! The ward's over there. Come on. Hurry up! - Doctor. My brother! You have to help! - You need to relax. - We're gonna help him. Let's go! - Please help him! - Okay. - [doctor] He's lost a lot of blood. - And you are his, uh... - His little brother. [man 2] Please! Please help me! - What's his blood type? - [man 1] It's A positive. [doctor] Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Nurse, let's start with 300cc of type A right now. Now! Stat! Sir, you need to wait outside. We need to start treatment. - Oh my God. - [doctor] Please wait outside. Go on, sir. [man 2] Don't try to stop me! [man 1] You'll be okay. Just hang in there. [nurse] Please go wait outside. We have to go now. - [man 1] Wildan, stay strong! - [nurse] Sir, please wait outside. Stay strong. [people clamoring] I'll be fine. Don't worry. [sobbing] Wildan! [nurse 2] Sir, please stay still. Sir, can you give me your name, please? Narendra. Mr. Narendra? All right. We're almost done. [doctor] How's he doing? Put pressure on it. [somber music playing] Nurse, will you give him a hand, please? [somber music continues] [man] Narendra! [Narendra] Arai! [both sobbing] [all sobbing] [woman] It's okay. We're here. We're here for you now. It's okay. - Don't cry. It's okay. - [all sobbing] I just washed Wildan's body. There was nothing I could do. [sobbing] There was nothing I could do. [siren wailing] [woman 2] Please be careful! Mom! Hurry, please! Doctor! It's all right. We've got her now. - [woman 3] Ang! - [Ang whimpering] [woman 3] Ang! Ang, look at me! Eyes on me, Ang. [doctor] Take him to unit two. [woman 3] Just breathe. [doctor] Ma'am? Ma'am, are you his wife? Uh, no, I'm his colleague. - [doctor] Wait there. - [woman 3] Okay. [Ang moaning] [woman 3] Uh... - [doctor] Have you known him long? - [woman 3] Yes. [doctor] It's all right, sir. It's all right. Just take some deep breaths. That's it. Very good. Okay. Ang, I'm right here, okay? Ang? [doctor] Breathe in. Nice and slow, sir. Very good. [ethereal music playing] [panting] - Hey! - Hey! What's wrong? Is he gonna be okay? He spent the night in the office and suddenly collapsed. - I have no idea what's going on... - Did you call Lika? He told me not to. Call her. He collapsed. She deserves to know. I know, but... How is he doing? [doctor] Well, the good news is he's fine. He suffered a severe panic attack. When that happens, the brain instructs the nervous system to avoid further stress, and then the body produces adrenaline, which in turn triggers an increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood flow to the muscles. It's the body's way of responding to extreme stress. And, uh, by the looks of him, he's been under an immense amount of stress the last few days. - [oxygen hisses] - [Ang groans] [man] I see. This is fairly common then? - [doctor] It does happen. - Ndre. Is that you, pal? - We appreciate it. Thanks, doctor. - Thank you. Ang? You need to rest, okay? What happened, man? What time is it? - Almost nine o'clock. - [Ang sighs] Nurse? I'm feeling a lot better. I think I can go now. Sir, the doctor has strongly advised you stay another night, so we can... No, I really need to leave right now. Hey, listen to the doctor. Nurse, I'm fine. I just want to go home. Can I please do that? What if you leave and something happens on the way home? What then? [sighs] Well, in that case, I can always come back here. If it's about tomorrow, Pingkan and I can handle it. [Ang grunts] This isn't about work, Ndre. [grunts] Oh yeah, Kan. Can you deal with the paperwork? Thanks so much. Uh, yeah. Okay, fine, but where the hell are you going? To the airport. My mom's flight gets in soon. [Pingkan scoffs] What? Oh! [Pingkan sighs] [man 3] Sir, please. I know you're incredibly busy, but if you could make this quick... It's for our family. - [woman] Please. There's the card. - You need to fill out the form first. What's going on, Gus? This guy. They said the service to transport Wildan's body was free, and now they're charging us. Jerk! It is free in the Greater Jakarta area, but there's a fee for East Java! Sir, please help us. We don't have the money. Just please give us a break. [clerk] Kid, there's nothing I can do. If it's outside Jakarta, you gotta pay. Uh, is there a manager here I could maybe speak to? Sir, I don't know how else to explain this to you. Hey, man. Listen. I don't know what your problem is, but we're going through a tough time right now. No need to add insult to injury. Hey, I'm giving you the facts. You'd better watch your mouth! You wanna take this outside? 'Cause I'll go out there and kick your ass. Bring it! - You're a tough guy! - Sir, please. We need some help. - I know, sir. Just wait there. - [man 3] Hey, stay out of this! I don't know who the hell you think you are, but it's none of your business! - Now get away from me! - [woman] Stop it! - [man 3] Look at me when I'm talking! - [woman] You're making it worse! Any news? There's a way. But not until tomorrow morning. How much? We shouldn't have to pay anything. We shouldn't have to make a scene at a hospital. If I had just stopped him from going, Wildan would still be here today! But I just let him go! I should have stopped him from leaving. [sobbing] This is all my fault! Hey. There's no way you could've known anything was gonna happen to him. He's right, Rai. We can't change what happened to Wildan. Narendra should be the one to console you. - [Gus] Oh, it's okay. - [Arai sighs] - [man 3] Hey, Arai! - [woman] Rai! [man 3] Where are you going? Hey, let me go home first and pack up some clothes, but I want to help you take Wildan home, okay? Grab some clothes for me too? They're on the top shelf of my wardrobe. I can make you some food for you too. Agus'll bring it back here. Hey, wait. Do you have any change on you? I just need to call back home. - Oh, yeah. Of course. - [coins jangling] Here. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Thank you. - Stay strong, all right? - I will. [somber music playing] [exhales deeply] [coins jangling] Here we go. - [sobbing] - [Narendra inserts coins into phone] Hey, Sis. It's Narendra. Wildan's gonna be home sometime tomorrow night. But I'm gonna need you to pray for him, all right? I'm doing the best I can here to make sure that Wildan gets back home. [sighs] Yeah, Sis. [coins drop] [woman sobbing] Sorry. Did you know someone on the train too? My mother has a blood disorder. She needs emergency surgery. But they apparently ran out of blood. [sniffles] I've been desperately trying to contact the Red Cross. But no one's answering. My father's been out of town. I lost my brother Wildan this afternoon. He also needed blood. [emotional music playing] [Narendra] Uh... What I'm trying to say is, maybe you should just go there directly. To the Red Cross. [woman] Yeah. Hey, miss? If you want company, I can go with you, if you want. Plus, maybe if they see me like this, it'll get their attention. [emotional music building] [man on radio] The train accident occurred yesterday in Pondok Betung, Bintaro, South Jakarta. The number of casualties continues to increase with a staggering 76 victims, and 450 injured. Those numbers are expected to rise even higher. Rescue efforts... Thank you so much for helping me. [radio continues in background] I know you... just lost your brother. Here you are helping me, and you're hurt yourself. [on radio] ...nothing seemed irregular. Information on what happened... My brother might still be alive if he hadn't tried to save me. [sighs] So I made a promise to him and myself that I'd try and do the same for other people. [radio continues quietly] [Narendra sighs] [emotional music continues] [emergency brake clicks] [engine stops] [woman] Lika, are you at the airport? [Lika] Yes, I'm here. Don't worry. But I haven't seen him yet. - [woman] And Angkasa? - [Lika] Yeah, he's here. [woman] Where is he? [Lika] He's right here. - Wanna talk to him? - [woman] Yeah. [Lika] Your mom. [somber piano music playing] [Ang] Hello? [mom] Angkasa, why isn't your phone on? Are you not coming, Mom? [mom] Your father is. Look, I don't know exactly what's going on with you, but I'm sure your father will be more helpful than I would be. - [Lika] Hey! - Hey, Lik! - [Lika chuckles] - You all good? - Yeah, I'm good. - You sure? - Dad. - [dad] Hey, Ang. How are you? Huh? So where to? I'm starving. Dad, wait here. - [dad] Are you okay? - Sure. I'm gonna go get the car. [dad] Okay. Lika's busy, huh? Talking off like that. But, you know, I'm glad she could still come pick me up. Ang. Eat up. [reflective music playing] [man] All right! Welcome to Jakarta. This is where we'll be living. Come on! [Wildan] Arai! This is my little brother, Narendra. - Arai. - Narendra. [Wildan] Where is everyone? [Wildan] Hello? Hey, we're here! - Gus! - [woman] Oh yay! You're here! Yeah. This is Inah. Oh wow! Oh my God! - So handsome! [giggles] - Yeah. [chuckles] And this is Mr. Amper, Inah's husband. [laughs] - I told you, take it off. - [Gus] All right. What's going on in here? Hey! Gus, my little brother. - Agus. - Narendra. [Wildan chuckles] Don't be shy. - They're like family. - All right then. [Arai] Narendra. Your brother tells us you're gonna be headed to college, huh? [chuckles lightly] Yes. That is wonderful! It's about time we had someone in this house with a decent education! - [laughs] Am I right? - [Inah laughs] Narendra, you should know, besides what he spends on meals, every single dollar Wildan makes at work he saves up to make sure he can put you through college. All of it. [laughs] Okay, that's enough. Why don't you go get yourself settled? - He had a long trip, huh. - [Amper] Yeah. - We'll go out tomorrow, okay? Come on. - Yeah. I'll show you our room. It's just across there. And that's the bathroom. Go ahead and take a shower. [Wildan] Bro, can you move the chair, please? This table is Mr. Amper's, but you can use it to study. All right. You can use the top shelf of the wardrobe for your clothes. I emptied it out before you got here. It's all yours now. We'll share the room for now. But if I can find a place around here that's more affordable, we'll move there so you can have your own space. [Narendra] No, no. This is fine. Everyone here seems really nice. [Wildan] Oh. Yeah. They've become like family to me. All you have to think about is studying. Focus. Don't worry about anything else. And be careful out there. I'm serious. It's tough living here. Listen to me, okay? I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you can get through college. You have to focus on your studies. Got it? This could change everything for us. - Okay? - [Narendra] Definitely. [heartfelt music playing] [hurried footsteps] [woman] Narendra! You won't believe it! My mom is gonna be okay! Thank you. They moved her to another room, so I came out to look for you. That's my dad. [dad] Please make sure my wife is well taken care of. - Okay. - Hey, Dad. This is Narendra, the one I told you about. He helped me get a blood donor for Mom. Thank you. [light piano music playing] - Um, I'm gonna go see her. - Yeah, okay. Come on. Nice to meet you. Get some money to pay that kid. If you hadn't have been there, I might not have been able to see her smile again. Thank you so much. Ajeng, I think we'd better leave... now. We'll come back tomorrow, okay? [tapping on door] [dad] There's the man. Come on in, Wirjawan. Mr. Mitro. Jeng, sorry I'm late. Hey. This is Narendra. He's the one who helped me get a blood donor for Mom. [Wirjawan] Oh? I'm her boyfriend. Wirjawan. - Narendra. - [Wirjawan] Thanks. [man] Sir? This is from Mr. Soemitro. Oh. No, really. I just... - Please, just take it. - [Ajeng] She's stable now. - Afternoon. - [man] Hey. Ang, did you move? Ang? Hi. - [man 2] Hey. - [Ang] Hello. [dad] Ang, whose place is this? We'll be staying in here. This is where we'll be sleeping tonight. [dad] Wait. Where is Lika, Ang? Ang? Oh, did you two have a fight or something? Okay. If you won't talk to me, I'll just ask Lika. [sighs] Dad. [tapping on cell phone] [Ang] Dad, stay out of it. This is my problem. Oh! Now I see why you wanted your mother to come. Ang. When you're married, sometimes you can blow the smallest things out of proportion. I was the same at the beginning... - Don't act like you have it all together. - Hey! All I'm trying to do is help the two of you to get through this. But fine. It's okay. I've been living here for three weeks, Dad. I haven't seen Lika in a while. We're having major issues. Our relationship isn't what it used to be. So please could you just stay out of it? I wanted Mom to come because I needed her take on it, not yours. I still have work to do. If you want to come, come. If not, fine. [poignant music playing] ["Prahara Cinta" by Lydia & Imaniar playing] [Narendra clears throat] Are you all set? Yeah. - [Ajeng] Ready to go? - Yup. ["Prahara Cinta" continues playing] [Ajeng chuckles softly] We still on for tomorrow? Dinner at the Trio Restaurant? [Ajeng] Mm-hmm. I've been dying to eat there for ages but never had the chance. This time it's my treat. - [Narendra] Thanks for the lift. - [Ajeng] Get to work. Take care, okay? - [Narendra] You too. - [Ajeng] Bye! ELLYAS PICAL, INDONESIA'S BOXING ARENA SUPERHERO I'm telling you. Sukardi's gonna win! Elly's in bad shape. Come on! You're way too confident in Sukardi! Bro, I'm positive that Sukardi will be KO'd in the third round. - Huh? Hey, can you make a bet on that? - You're damn right! - [Gus] Bro, your money's on round three? - [Amper] Yeah. - [Gus] I'm putting mine on the fourth. - [Arai] One hundred. [Narendra] That's it. Keep gambling your money away Forget about work! [Arai] Gambling's work, too, you know? I'm making money. Wanna bet, Narendra? No, thanks. I'm broke. Oh, you got no money, but you still manage to go on dates? That's right. I'd much rather spend my money on dates. I'm not like you, always betting or playing the lottery. - [all laughing] - [Amper] You know me too well! - [laughing] - [Arai] He's got a point! [uplifting music playing] [Inah singing] [Gus] Bro! [spits] Has it started yet, Gus? [radio sportscaster chattering in background] [Amper] Ah, he's gonna win! I'm sure of it. Sukardi's gonna take it. [Gus] They're not even in the same league. Are you going out to see your girlfriend? You bet I am. You look just like a model, Narendra! [Narendra laughs] I'm late! Don't go yet. Ellyas has got some wicked new moves! [knocking on door] Yeah? Ah, good. You're already ready. Wirjawan's here. Come on. Don't keep him waiting. [Wirjawan] But you'll be there tomorrow, won't you? - [Soemitro] Of course I will. - [Wirjawan] Good. [Soemitro] I wouldn't miss it. [Wirjawan] Great, because my father wanted me to make sure you're coming. He wants to introduce you to some big investors from Hong Kong. - [Soemitro] Ah! I see. - [Wirjawan] Oh yeah. Wirjawan, you should take Ajeng along with you too. So when the two of you are married, Ajeng will be accustomed to the experience. Just relax. You have nothing to worry about. You just have to stand next to me and look pretty. I'll introduce you to everyone there. Then they'll finally stop asking me, "Where is your fiancée?" [chuckles] - [somber music playing] - [chuckles] But it's a business event, Dad. What would people say if they saw a director general's daughter there? There's no need to worry about that. It's perfectly normal. I think Ajeng's right, dear. If it's a business event, it would be better if Ajeng didn't attend. [Soemitro] Ajeng, you're going. It's about time that you make your relationship public. - [server] Are you ready to order, sir? - No, not yet. [sighs] [somber music playing] - [woman] Put the bags over here. - [man 1] Right here. [man 2] Hey, hey! How are you doin'? [indistinct chatter] [man 3] Yeah, got it right here! [woman 2] Yeah, two minutes. I'll be right with you. [indistinct chatter continues] [radio static] [on radio] Elly's advanced with a right uppercut. Here comes Sukardi with a glorious punch! Oh, that one hurt Elly! [music playing inside] [people singing along to music] [singing continues] [singing growing louder] [singing] - [Inah] Hey, look! He's here! - [Arai laughing] [Amper] Hey, what the hell happened to you? Ajeng has been waiting for you. Come on. Bro, whose karaoke machine is this? [Amper] Ah, someone asked me to fix it. We were testing it out. Agus was just giving it a little test run when you walked in. [music continues over speakers] I'm sorry. Wirjawan suddenly showed up to talk business with my dad. That's why I'm late. - When I got there, you were already gone. - [music stops] So I figured I'd come here. Can I get a rain check? You're not mad, are you? No, I'm not. We'll just do it another time. [Arai] Jeng! Get over here. You gotta do this one! I put it on just for you. Just belt it out like you're a rock star. - Okay. - [Arai] Come on, buddy. You too. [Ajeng] Uh... [pop music playing over speakers] YOU BEAUTIFUL ONE - [Ajeng] Come with me! - [Narendra] Where to? I'm still working! [Ajeng] Sh! No more questions. Come on! Hurry! [Narendra laughs] Oh man! - Where are we going? Come on, tell me. - [Ajeng] Just trust me, okay? Get in. Okay. Ready? - [Narendra] Ready for what? - [both laugh] Where are we going? Seriously. Would you just relax? Oh, it's a secret? - Whose house is this? - [Ajeng] Hmm? Ajeng, are you joking? If I'd known, I would've gone home to get changed first. I stink! Don't worry about it. Now my mom will smell what I smell every day. - [Narendra] Jeng... - [Ajeng chuckles] Come on. Hey, Mom! [sentimental music playing] [Ajeng] Come. [mom] Finally, we get to meet. Ma'am. [Ajeng laughs softly] Relax. This is my mom's house. She bought it without my dad knowing about it. - Come on in. - Jeng! So you came... all the way to Jakarta to be with your brother? Wildan was the first one to get here. You see, he was supposed to get married, except... Then, when our mother and father died, he canceled it and decided to come to Jakarta. So you lost both your parents? Mom and Dad died... five years ago in an excavation site. I was still in high school at the time. That's why after I graduated, Wildan insisted I go to college in Jakarta. [reflective music playing] When Wildan died, all I could think... was how quickly I could finish off all my schooling and grant him everything he's worked for. To be successful and to work hard. What are you majoring in? Industrial engineering, ma'am. I do a lot of calculating and counting. And right now, I work part-time as an inventory clerk at the fish market that my landlord owns. So I apologize. I don't always smell like this, ma'am. [chuckles] You know... you remind me a lot of Ajeng's older brother. [sentimental music continues] [Ajeng] A year before the accident, Dad kicked him out of the house because he insisted on being a photographer. Arya was so stubborn. Always picking fights with Dad. - Always so headstrong. - [chuckles] So my mom got that house just in case my dad left nothing in his will for Arya. But Arya really didn't care, you know? [Narendra chuckles] I mean, he traveled so much, and he was barely home. But Arya's brave. He always... wanted to live and work on his own terms... and absolutely refused to depend on his parents' support. [sighs] When he got thrown out, I was really worried for him, you know? But he once told me, "No one knows what lies ahead." "If you work hard, one day you'll reap what you sow." Too bad he died so young. He never got the chance to succeed, or to prove to our dad that he could do it. [dad] Ang. If you don't want me here, I can take a late flight home tonight. It's fine. You already know what I'm dealing with here. The least you could do is not add to the drama. [workers chatting indistinctly] - [Ndre] Okay, don't be long. - [Ang] Ndre. - [Ndre] Hey. - [Ang] Where's Pingkan? Over there. - Hello. - Hey, Andre. - You alone? - I came with Angkasa. No, I mean, your wife didn't come with you? - Oh, no! - [laughs] - [Pingkan] What are you doing here? - [Ang] I said today was going to be busy. [Pingkan] We told you to get some rest. [Ang] Well, the hotel manager wants to meet us. He said there's another conference next month, and he wants to introduce us to the organizers. So go and see him, and tell him to meet us at... the lounge. - Okay? - [Pingkan] Yeah, okay. I'll get my bag. Hold on! You knew about it? [woman] I had a feeling, but I didn't know that he'd moved out. I just thought they were having a little spat, that it would blow over. So I figured it'd be better if you went there. Do you know what the problem is? Not yet. He wouldn't tell me. He's barely talking to me. Wouldn't even listen to what I have to say. Maybe you should hear him out first, and then give him some advice. [somber music playing] Maybe you should've come down here, not me. Actually, I think this might be the perfect opportunity for you two to be together. You've been saying that you felt like he's been pushing you away. Now might be a good time to try and fix that. Angkasa needs you, dear. All right then. Lika's always saying no. She doesn't want me near her. That's why I needed my mother's perspective as a woman. [Pingkan] Does it have to be your mom? I mean, why don't you just ask Lika? I did, but she never answered me. All she kept saying was, "We have a problem." Whenever I asked her what that problem is, she never told me. Because you two have communication issues. Communication issues? Right. How can we communicate if she won't speak to me? When was the last time you actually spoke to her? Um... Speaking like two people who want the same things in life. Have a real conversation. Been a while, huh? Lika and I talk every single day. She needs someone to talk to. Yeah, is that why she goes to Billy's? Because she needs to talk? Why bring up Billy? You don't seriously think that they're just friends, do you? Yes, I do, because they are just friends. Maybe Lika needed a friend to confide in, so... It's like Billy is a friend to Lika, the same way that I'm a friend to her. - They're just friends... - Go meet with the manager, okay? [Pingkan] Angkasa, where are you going now? [Ang] I need to go see that guy. [Pingkan] What? Why? Wait! Angkasa! Ang! Ang! Angkasa! [sighs] Angkasa! [mysterious music playing] Angkasa! Sa! I heard you were at the hospital this morning? Don't be mad at Pingkan, okay? I'm still your wife. I need to know these things. [emotional music playing] Need to know what? [sighs] That I had a panic attack? That I might not be ready for the meeting we have scheduled tonight? I thought I could trust you. [Pingkan] I thought I was doing... [Pingkan sighs] - Ang... - [elevator bell chimes] [Ndre] Oh really? From Jakarta? I was in Jakarta too. Andre! Andre! Andre! Stop him! Come on, Andre! Go after him, Andre! Andre! Hurry! Stop him! [Andre sighs, groans] [Pingkan] Go get Angkasa! Ugh! - What is it this time? - [panting] Don't worry. His dad is on it. [breathing heavily] He's going after Billy! Whoo! Oh boy. [laughs] Angkasa! [dad panting] What's the hell, Ang? If you wanna come, hop in. [Ajeng] I want to try talking to my father. I want to tell him that I don't want to marry Wirjawan. Are you sure? I feel like I can be myself here. And do whatever I want. As long as you're here... As long as we have each other... I'm good. You feel that way too? [tender music playing] Yes, I do. [light acoustic music playing] ["Sesaat Kau Hadir" playing] [keys jangle] [unlocks door] Okay. [starts car] ["Sesaat Kau Hadir" continues] [Narendra] What? [men grunting] - [grunting continues] - ["Sesaat Kau Hadir" continues] [Narendra coughing] [coughs] [both laughing] [indistinct conversation] [groaning] [Inah and Amper continue chatting and laughing] ["Sesaat Kau Hadir" ends] [tense music playing] [car door closes] [Wirjawan] Mr. Mitro. I'm sorry for what my daughter Ajeng has done to you. Hmm. Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna let this get back to my father. But just so you know, I sent the guy a warning. And I... seriously doubt that he has... the guts to fight back. Now it's all up to you and Ajeng. It'd be a shame to... let something as trivial as this ruin the relationship our families have established. Yes. Once again, I apologize. If you'll excuse me then. Good evening. [car 1 pulls away] [car 2 doors close] [Soemitro] Your daughter is a complete fool! Ajeng doesn't understand the consequences of her actions at all! If Wirjawan gets his heart broken and asks his father for revenge, I'll lose everything! Everything! [solemn music playing] Your children only... think about their selfish needs! While I... I have to think about the entire family. I do! I failed with my first child. Your precious son. A man who bore no responsibility to family. You tell Ajeng, do not make a fool out of this family. Don't destroy what I've spent decades building! [solemn music continues] [Ajeng sniffles] [sobbing] [mom] You're going against your father's wishes. And now he... he feels humiliated. But did he have to hit me? [sobbing] [somber music playing] Your engagement with Wirjawan... will be made official soon. Mom! I need you to back me up on this, please. Will you? [sobbing] [mom] I don't doubt your feelings in all this. I'm just afraid that... that it might lead to something far worse for you in the future. [car horn honking] [honking] [engine revving] [dad] Ang. Ang! Ang! - Slow down, Ang! - [horn honking] [continues honking horn] Angkasa, there's only one lane here. [emergency brake clicks] [Ang] You drive. [Ang sighs] Where are we going? South Kuta, Dad. - [Ang clears throat] - [cell phone vibrating] [cell phone vibrating] Why are we headed to South Kuta, Ang? [cell phone continues vibrating] - I hope you've thought this through. - [phone bleeps off] - [cell phone vibrating] - Shit! [phone bleeps off] - [phone chimes] - [sighs] DAD, HELP. ANGKASA PROBABLY WANTS TO START A FIGHT AT BILLY'S Who's this Billy? I understand if you don't want to talk about Lika, but if you're looking to start a fight with someone, I want to know about it. She's cheating on me with Billy. Really? Do you have any proof, huh? Billy is some old friend of hers from Jakarta, Dad. He moved here, and that's why Lika's always going to see him these days. So the first thing you thought of is she's cheating on you. Ang... Look, it's obvious, Dad. Billy's had a thing for Lika for years. Now that he's here, he's just moving in for the kill. And you're sure about this? You might be wrong. [tense music playing] That's why we're going there now. I want answers. So what are you going to do? Make him admit to everything? Huh? You can't go in there guns blazing. Not like this. You have to stay calm. Listen, Ang. You have to be ready for two possibilities. If you're wrong about this, you have to be ready to apologize for it. But if you're right about it, then you're going to have to accept it and move on. Neither one of those will be easy. [somber piano music playing] We're not gonna get there for a while. There's still time turn back if you want. [inhales and exhales deeply] We're going, Dad. Keep driving. I'll show you how to get there. Okay. [indistinct background chatter] [man] Hey, wait up! [coins rattling in pay phone] [tapping on number pad] [line ringing] [phone rings] [Narendra] Hello, may I speak with Ajeng? I'm sorry. I'm afraid Miss Ajeng isn't home. When will she be back? [woman] I'm sorry, miss, but I'm following orders from Mr. Soemitro. [Soemitro] You don't have to worry. I've taken care of everything. Say hello to your parents. [gates squeak] Narendra! If you're thinking about going to Ajeng's place, give it up! Don't get yourself into trouble. [Gus] Hang with us, man. We're, uh... We're just regular people, man. We don't belong in that world. [Narendra] Hey, Gus, listen. Not letting her go. [Gus] Bro, he's dead if he gets caught again. - You gotta talk to him. - What do you mean, "me"? Let Mr. Amper talk to him. [Inah] He'll listen to you. You talk to him! [Amper] Hey. Narendra. Come here. Yeah, I wanna talk to you. Move. What is this? We need to get one thing straight from now on, huh? I think all of us here are like a family. Am I right about that? Hmm? Mm, mm, mm! Now, Narendra, I was young once, too, and... Well, sometimes, young men, they can... they can act before they think. Oh, ah, I could tell you stories! Things that I did and that I said. Trouble I got into. And even some acts of indiscretion. Why did it happen? Well, because a young man's blood... Come on! Would you just... You blather and you blab! - Get to the point! - I do not blab! [grunts] You guys, you all know I'm not great with the heart-to-heart talks. - You guys do it! - Fine! I'll do the talking then! - All right, listen... - Guys, what's going on? - Is this about Ajeng? - Yeah, it's about her. Narendra. Can't you be with somebody who's not gonna get you beat up? If we knew that Ajeng had a fiancé all along, we never would have let you do this! I don't recall asking for your approval. Huh? [Arai sighs] Come on, Narendra. You know I didn't mean it like that. Listen, buddy. You're like the little brother that I never had, and we're all family here. And we just don't want anything bad to happen to you, that's all. Look! You're all beat up. And you're lucky that it wasn't worse. And if you end up dead, then what? Buddy, standing in front of her house at night is really lame. You gotta snap out of this, man. It's pathetic. How much longer are you gonna keep this up, huh? What Mr. Amper was trying to say is right. - Sh! Hey! - So was Arai. [Inah clears throat] [Gus] Inah's with us too. This is your family talking. We're saying these things because we care about you. And we don't want to see you get into any more trouble. Then you should all know that it's an arranged marriage. She doesn't want this! Fine, man. Whatever. But the bottom line is that rich kids are destined to marry other rich kids. You gotta know who you are, Narendra. Her mother knows who I am, and I got her blessing. That's enough for me. - Ren, remember what your brother did. - [Narendra] Gus... I know very well what my brother did for me, all right? And... I'm going to be graduating soon. - [Arai] Hey, look... - [Inah] Why not just relax and calm down! So tell us then. What is your plan? [tender music playing] Hold on a second, Ang. [panting] Shit! Dad! Dad! Jesus, stop! - You're not allowed to do that in Bali! - You scared me! [groans] You're not supposed to piss on the road in Bali! [dad] What am I supposed to do then? Jesus! Fine! I'm done. [Ang] Damn! Were you serious, or were you kidding me? I'm serious, Dad. We have to respect Mother Nature. No one pisses on the road here! - [sighs] It's considered bad karma. - Huh? If you knew about it, why didn't you tell me before I got out? How was I supposed to know you were about to take a leak on the side of the road? [dad] It's too late now! You jumped out of the car like it was on fire, whipped down your zipper and started spraying the road! [dad] When you gotta go... [seat belt clicks] [dad] Speaking of karma, I've got a story about your mom and I that I've never told you before. What story? Um, well... It's about the time I stole your mother away from her boyfriend. Oh man, this ought to be pretty good. [horn beeps] [Soemitro] Mr. Soegiarto, welcome. I've been well. [unsettling music playing] Glad to have you, sir. Mrs. Murni. Please. - [Wirjawan] Ah! - [Soemitro] Wirjawan! - Mr. Mitro. - Nice to see you. [Wirjawan laughs] Thank you for having us. [unsettling music continues] [man] What's wrong, sir? [engine running] [huffs] - [man] What's wrong? - [Wirjawan] What happened? [unsettling music continues] You don't know where they are? [Gus] No, we really don't. But you live together. How could you not know, huh? [Gus] Well... Well, yeah, we live together, but this is also... [officer 2] Hey! Every single one of you gave the same answer! Are you in on it together? You realize your friend kidnapped the daughter of a dignitary, right? You could all be charged as accomplices! You got that? Is it really kidnapping if they love each other? [officer 1] So you do know where they are? [officer 2] Yes, you just said they're in love! - So you do know where they are, right? - No, sir. I was... - [officer 2] You just said... - Hey! He said he doesn't know, all right? Don't you come barging into my house yelling at us! - Take it easy! - They're pissing me off! I want them out! - Why is it wet here? - Yeah, what is that? [Amper] You piss your pants? [Inah] Are you serious? Arai, what's the matter with you? [officer 1] Oh jeez! [Arai] Be careful on your way home, officers. Don't come back now, you hear? [groans] What did I say, huh? I told Narendra he'd get in trouble! Why the hell wouldn't he tell us she's the daughter of a dignitary? I told him straight up, if he wants a girl, get one from the village. But no! But you told the police just now you don't know where they are. What else could I have said, Mr. Amper? Listen, we may have gotten away with it for now, but the minute they catch us lying, boom! Wait. How is it that we're lying? We genuinely don't know where Narendra and Ajeng are right now. That's right. We aren't lying if we really don't know where they are. We do know, though. - No, we don't. - Yeah, we do. - No, we don't! - Just hold on a sec. Gus, let me ask you something. You knew Narendra went to elope with Ajeng, right? I thought they were going out for dinner. If they went for dinner and haven't come back yet, then that's called eloping, Agus! Yeah, maybe. - You know what that means, huh? - Yeah. Ah! So tell me then, guys. Who rented the car to help Narendra kidnap Ajeng? He did, all right? Aha! All right, fine. I rented the car. But I couldn't know he was gonna take off with her. Could I? Yeah, he couldn't possibly know that. What's the matter with you? So maybe we didn't know all the details, but if the police find out everything we actually know, look here. See? See? We'll be cuffed and thrown in prison. Maybe. And if it's like it is in the movies, they'll probably start spying on us! They were already spying on us! Oh my God. Are you serious right now? - Hey! - [man] Huh? Dude, are you a spy? [Arai] Wow! Gus, it's Ali, Haji Najib's son. Haji Najib? [sighs] Well, that's it. This ruins everything. We already owe that family a lot. And that is your debt! Your position. Nothing to do with Ajeng. [tense music playing] Everything I did, I did it for her. - For her sake and her children. - Stop it! [pensive music playing] I supported the marriage at first. But only because I thought Ajeng was fine with it. But now I know that she's made her own choice. So you really don't know where they are then? The point is, it had nothing to do with her boyfriend or your grandfather. But... Well, it's just that if a relationship is strong enough, it might be worth fighting for. If you really want to get to the truth of the matter, I can only tell you this. Accept it with honor. You owe it to yourself and to Lika. - Let's go... - No. Stay here, Dad. I mean it. stay here. Right hand to your upper thigh. Now raise your left hand above your ears. Mountain pose. [exhales] [Ajeng] I had a dream about my mom last night. She was smiling. But she also looked sad. [sighs] It's been a week. And I haven't heard from her. [solemn piano music playing] We could go see how she's doing. Would you like that? My father must be blaming everything on her now. I'm scared. [sniffles] I'm scared that something might happen to my mom... and I won't be there. [Ajeng sobbing] Hello? Arai? [mysterious music playing] [Narendra] This is what's best for now. I don't want you to regret anything or feel guilty. I want you to be there if anything were to happen to your mom. You need to know this, Narendra. My father will do everything in his power to destroy you, including getting the police involved. Well, then, I guess I'll do whatever I need to do to survive. Okay? Trust me on this. [softly] Yeah. [emotional music building] [Ajeng's mom] You're with a man who has suffered too many losses in his life. And I'm sure he doesn't want you or anyone else in his life to suffer the way he did. [sighs] Especially you. So now, what is it that you're planning on doing? I think that I'll get some legal advice. [mom sighs] [exhales deeply] Ajeng, no! No lawyer would ever go up against your father. [sniffles] Then I'm afraid we're gonna need your help again. Sweetheart, I've already done everything I can. [sniffles] Mom... When you believe in something, don't ever give up on what you want. [sighs] [typewriter keys clacking] [phone ringing] [solemn music playing] When a man has no future, a pauper like you... [Soemitro scoffs] ...dares to ruin my daughter's life by eloping or, as I call it, kidnapping, you can bet I'm gonna make sure... I didn't kidnap your daughter, sir. Well, you... better know you just made a massive mistake! I'm gonna make your life a living hell. Whatever you think you can do to me is nothing compared to what I've already lived. I know I'm poor. I know who I am. But luckily for me, in other ways I'm wealthy 'cause your daughter, Ajeng, she still loves me no matter what. Don't you think for a second about taking me to court. Hear? I'll cause you so much pain that you'll long for the life you lived before you ever crossed paths with me, you son of a bitch! Do your best then. Go ahead. [tense music playing] [Narendra] If we really both love your daughter, then neither one of us should be afraid of losing her to the other. [huffs] Hey! In life, there's a first time for everything. Including losing. [Ajeng] "Their laughter was loud and full of joy." "But suddenly, it's as if the last notes of their laughter was swallowed by a giant." [chuckles] - "Fading away." - [knock on door] Ma'am. Jeng, can we talk for a minute? I've always wanted to make you my wife. [Ajeng] But you know in the end, neither of us would be happy. Oh, we've known each other since we were teenagers. And I've always considered you a good friend. But I never wanted more than that for us. I never wanted this arranged marriage. When we were younger, it seemed fine. But after Narendra came into my life... I finally saw what I truly want. I want to make my own choice without anyone telling me what to do. You have a right to be happy too. With someone who loves you as much as you love them. And that's not me. [somber piano music playing] [Ajeng sighs] [laughs softly] You should've seen how angry Narendra made your dad. That was brave. That's when I realized... where you get all that amazing courage of yours. [hopeful music playing] Ridwan. Jeng. Take this. It'll be enough to pay for Narendra's bail. [hopeful music continues] [door opens] - [Narendra] Thank you, sir. - [officer] Sure. [music swells] [Billy] I'm not gonna lie to you. I've always had a thing for Lika, way before you two met. Whatever is going on with you two now is what brought us together again. But I have absolutely no intention of being that guy who takes advantage of someone's else problem. At first, I came here to beat you up. Yeah, if I were in your shoes, I'd probably do the same thing. But now all I really wanna know is what's going on between you two. Lika just needs someone to talk to, Ang. And it could be anyone out there. It could be me, or worse, somebody else who doesn't care about her. But one thing's for sure. You and I, we're alike. That's why she was coming here so often, even when I wasn't giving classes. What do you mean? [laughs softly] She never told you that I was married before, did she? It ended because it became an obsession for me. I didn't give her room to breathe. Your marriage isn't all about you and your goals and aspirations, especially if you have kids. Ang. [sighs] I know I'm not the best person to be doling out advice. Who am I, right? All I can tell you is that I've been there. Lika told me you two moved to Bali so you could live a life outside your father's shadow. She also told me you have this burning desire to prove yourself, to show everyone that you can be better than him. And I know that feeling. At first, it's just a goal you're shooting for, but then it becomes an obsession. You justify your actions as noble ambition, and you convince yourself that you're doing this for everyone. But in the end, we only end up hurting the... the people we love. [mellow music playing] To be honest, I was wondering when you'd show up. [Ang] Why? Did Lika tell you I was coming? [Billy] No. I haven't heard from Lika for almost a month. [Narendra] I thought you should know that I came here today to tell you that we've come to a decision. Ajeng and I will be continuing our relationship openly from now on. We arrived at this decision together. Ajeng. Choose right now! You either stay here in this house, with all the luxuries you've had since you were a child... or live a life of poverty with a pathetic man with no future. Choose. You already know. I choose Narendra. [emotional music playing] [mom] You two have my blessing. But I'm going to stay with your father. I won't leave here. Because, in the end, he's... still my husband. Mom. Thank you, Mom. Narendra, please take good care of my daughter. Love can be much stronger if you have to fight for it. Yeah, I promise. - [man] Do we have any of those left? - [indistinct chatter] [woman] Be careful! You don't want to drop them. - [man] How many? - [woman] There you go. [man] There's 80 kilos. - [Ajeng] Take a break, everyone! - [Arai] Hey, you got drinks! [Amper] That's good timing, right? [Arai] You can say that again. [laughs softly] [Arai] Are you a fisherman or what? Come on. Here, drink up, Gus. [sentimental music playing] From Mr. Amper. Wow! - There's a lot here. [chuckles] - Yup. Mm! Mm, this smells so good. - Want some more? - A bit. - There you go. - [knocking on door] [knocking continues] [knocking continues] Message from the boss. He wants this house vacated immediately. Who are you? And keep your voice down. It's still early. [tense music playing] Open it. Open the window! Dad! Go on. I'm married now, Dad. And I'm living my own life. You can't control me anymore, no matter what you think. And besides, this house is not yours. It's Mom's! You chose to leave me and your mother, right? Well, now I no longer have anything to do with you. This house is a family asset, so it's no longer yours to use. You chose that boy. Now go live with him. But it won't be here. From this day forward, I want nothing to do with either of you. You have no right to evict us! Drive. [mom] Hey! That house is mine! I can't believe you could throw them out without even saying anything to me! And now you too? You went and bought that house without my permission! You should've been on my side, not supporting a daughter who chose to leave her family. Ajeng is still my daughter! And if I choose to help her, then I have every right to! They are never going to live in that place, and I'm going to make sure of that! Then I have no choice. I'm just going to have to take this up in court. Are you really going to sue your own husband, huh? Huh? [mom] Yes. If that's what it takes to protect my daughter, that's exactly what I'll do. [Inah] Go ahead. Dig in, everyone. [sighs] Take your mind off it for now. Let's eat. Come on now. Here. There you go. Eat up. Ajeng, you're gonna love this. Thank you. JOB VACANCY CLOSED [woman] So now what? [man] All right. We're good. Let's go! Here. I'm... sorry I came by unannounced. [thunder rumbling, rain pattering] [Ajeng] My mom only wants to help you. To help us. Why did you refuse that? I don't want us to keep taking help from your mother. It reflects poorly on us. I'm working, and I can take care of us. I know, but Mom could actually help you find work. She's got a lot of connections. The more of these odd jobs you have to keep taking, the longer it's gonna take you to finish school. You don't think I'll finish school? - I need you to have a bit of faith in me. - I do, but let me help you. I can work too. You don't have to do everything yourself. Ajeng! [heartfelt music playing] [Wildan] There's no sin in being born poor. The real sin is if you don't do anything to change that. [reflective music playing] That's why I did everything I could to make sure you went to school. An education will open doors for you and provide you with opportunities. And I let you come with me when I went to work so you could see for yourself how hard it is to make a living. The day that you succeed... will be the best day ever. We'll be able to celebrate together because that'll mean we both succeeded. When the going gets tough... the tough get going. Now show them how tough you are. [water running, dishes clinking] I'm sorry that I made your life harder than it has to be. That was never my intention. But I'm the one who's taking care of you now. And I'll do anything to make sure you have no regrets. I always knew what I was getting into. There was never a doubt. And I know that we can make it together. But I'm not gonna let you carry the burden all alone. And you need to trust me too. All we need to do is weather this storm... and the sky is the limit. I know it. [uplifting music playing] The key, Dad. - [dad] How'd it go? - We need to talk. [car starts] Do you have any idea why I moved here? Uh, yeah. Because you wanted to start your own business. You said that Bali was a lot more lucrative to hold events. It was so I could get away from you. And Mom. - And get out of that house. - Was I holding you back? Aurora went to London, and you came to Bali. Did I say not to? Never. I'm sorry you're having problems with Lika, but I don't think I'm to blame for that. Huh? And that's just it, though, Dad. This family seems so damn perfect. Everyone's happy. You and Mom are still madly in love. You're able to provide for your kids. We're both free to pursue our dreams and passions. Perfect. I don't know what you're trying to say. Part of the reason why Lika and I are fighting so much is because I told her I wanted to have children so I could prove that I can be just as good or even better a father than you were. That drove her even further away. But today I realized... that I'm the problem. I'm at fault here. You're like an open wound for me. [car door closes] [tender music playing] You are what I'm most proud of, you know that? Your mother and I's greatest accomplishment ever. If I somehow managed to hurt you in any way, then I'm so sorry for that. [emotional music building] [woman on radio] The enactment of government regulations which simplified the requirements for establishing banks has caused a sudden surge in the establishment of new banks. These new banks are attracting many young professionals... If you feel at all nauseous, just come home, okay? I'm fine. And so is he. [tender music continues] [Arai] Sh, sh! Guys! Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Yeah, there they are! [all cheering and clapping] You're so handsome, you could be on the cover of a magazine! Yeah, you two are moving up in the world! This guy works at a bank, hmm. And he's got a wife with a great job at a telephone company. [laughs] - Oh, we're all proud of you! [laughs] - [Inah laughing] Don't you go working too hard, Ajeng. You've got that little one to think of. Remember that. Pretty soon, we're all going to be working for you. [Arai laughing] Gus, I hear that if you touch a big shot's tie, that could be good luck. - Go on. Touch his tie! [laughs] - [Inah laughing] Have you eaten yet? - [Lika] Uh, not yet. - [dad] Come on. I'll make you some dinner. Do you have anything in the fridge? [chuckles] - [Lika] I haven't done groceries yet. - [dad] I'll come up with something. You know I make the world's best fried rice. - Let me take this for you. - Thanks. Lik. I just want you to know that if I've caused any trouble between you and Angkasa... I'm so sorry for that. I just found out that I'm the reason Angkasa has been in so much pain. [dad sniffles] And you've been shouldering all the weight of that. ["Masih Ada" playing] ["Masih Ada" continues] I'll come with you to the doctor's for your checkup, all right? Okay. Do you think we can fix this? This is something we've both been going through. We just need to find each other again. [cell phone vibrating] INCOMING CALL - Hello? - [man] Hello, Mr. Angkasa. I'm at the intersection, sir. - What? The intersection? - I'm not sure which way to go from here. Just a minute. I canceled the appointment with my lawyer earlier today. [man] Are you there, sir? Uh, hello? Yes, sir. I'm still here. So what's it gonna be? Lika and I have decided to postpone our meeting. Can I call you back? I'm sorry, can you repeat that, sir? [phone beeps] ["Masih Ada" continues] Ajeng. [Ajeng] Yes, sweetheart? Just had to tell you I miss you. [Soemitro] Where are you going? Ajeng just went into labor. It's a boy! [laughing] Thank God! [sobbing] [Amper] Congratulations! [all laughing] - Congratulations, Narendra! - [Narendra] It's a healthy baby boy! [Inah] Oh my God, I'm so happy for you! [Inah laughing] I can't believe it! [Arai] Oh God! You made sure that kid has all ten fingers, right? [Narendra] All ten, yeah! Gus, I bet you anything you used essential oil instead of fish oil. How much you wanna bet, huh? [Arai laughing] The guy's clueless! [laughing] Oh. ["Masih Ada" continues playing] [Arai] Hello, sir. Congratulations. How is my... my grandchild? Sir, it's a boy. A healthy boy. [cooing] ["Masih Ada" continues] [baby crying] [mom chuckles] I swear we'll be there for you and you'll have a great life. [gentle music playing]
