(dramatic music) - Good morning, Paul. - Good morning, Dr. Reasoner. I'm sorry to mess up your Sunday morning, but Dr. Leaventhal's tied up. - [Bob] No problem, whatcha got? - [Paul] Jane Doe, it looks like a botched abortion. She came in a little while ago in shock. Police found her in an alley. She's got extensive bleeding. - Her blood's ready, doctor, shall I start it? - [Paul] Yes, good. What do you think? - We'd better open her up. Lube her up to the alarm. - Yes, doctor. - [Doctor] We're raising more than usual. - [Bob] This is a tonsil sucker, I need an abdominal sucker. - [Female Nurse] Abdominal sucker. - [Bob] Quench stick. - [Doctor] This is terrible. - [Bob] Here, I need this sucker. - [Doctor] Regional chromics. - [Male Nurse] Blood pressure's dropping. - [Bob] What's the reading? - [Male Nurse] About 60 over 30, now. - [Bob] 60 over 30? - [Doctor] Need a small rongeur. - [Bob] I really can't believe this. - [Male Nurse] We're losing her. I got her blood wide open, I can hardly get her blood pressure now. Her eyes are dilating. Looks like she's gonna straight line. - [Bob] Pressure? - [Male Nurse] Can't get one. - [Bob] No pressure? - [Male Nurse] No pressure. (doctors talking) - Hi, Joe. - Our young colleague here wants to go public with the Brehinsky case but I think-- - Why stop until-- - Hey, you see my lips movin'? I'm talkin' here. - Look, I don't think you people realize what's going on. - Okay, tell us all about it. - We've got a hospital with an unspoken policy of abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide. - That's a lot of five dollar words. - It's the truth. - Well, you're wrong. Listen, Jacobs, if you were a little drier behind the ears you'd realize somethin'. I'm no abortionist, but the last thing we need around here is some sort of witch hunt. If there's two things all good Americans truly love it's lawsuits and conspiracies. You go splatterin' this to the papers, everybody loses. - Excuse me, what's going on here? What's the Brehinsky case? - Maggie Brehinsky, she died in the OR this morning. Abortion complications. - Who did it? - Phillips. - Our Dr. Phillips? - Unfortunately. - Did you know that Dr. Holland let another baby starve to death in Maternity? His payments through the line. It was deformed. - You're trying to make this personal, it isn't personal. - Like heck, it isn't. - All right. It's personal. So's abortion. - An astute observation. - Rough night. - Look, I asked you all to come here because I thought you were as fed up as I am. Now, none of this would be happening if we just said no to the whole package and stuck together. - He's right, but what can we do, doctor? - Well, I think Paul has the right idea. - Well, should we form a committee or something? - Let's just keep it informal. We'll simply draft a resolution to the board. - I'm for it. - Well, who's gonna put it together? - Dr. Reasoner, he's chief of staff. - Okay, let's keep this under wraps for a while, all right? - [Paul] Let's go get a coffee and talk about this. (birds chirping) (clock chiming) (knocking on door) (radio playing) (phone ringing) - [Nurse] Bye now. - [Patient] Thank you. - [Nurse] Colleen Bakersfield. Hi. How are you feeling today? - [B.J.] Fine. (bell ringing) (crowd talking) - [Tanya] Where do you want to sit? - Over there, go on, I'll be a minute. - [Tanya] Where are you going? - Billy. Billy, I need to talk to you. - [Billy] I just couldn't believe it. We all got so mad at him, it was ridiculous. - Billy, it's important. - So, he was acting like he was really neat and everything. - Billy. - Yeah, what do you want? - I need to talk to you. Alone. - I don't have anything to say to you. So, anyway, we get after the coach for making us run these 20 laps. Then he makes us do these workouts, again, I mean, for about an hour after practice. - [B.J.] Hi. - Well, hi there. - [B.J.] Mind if I join you? - Oh, certainly not. - [B.J.] Thanks. - So, how do you like playing Aunt Tiffany? - It's okay. - What's the matter? It was positive, wasn't it? Well, what now? Have you told Billy? - We broke up. - So what are you going to do now? Well, it just won't go away. As I see it, you've got two choices. You can either have the baby, in which case you'll lose your scholarship at the academy. Or, you can get an abortion. - Isn't there some other way? - Look, I thought acting was important to you. - It is. - But, then just don't sit there pining away, do something. My goodness, it's not the end of the world. I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you. I just so want you to be happy. You're good. You deserve a shot. But whatever you decide, I'll be here. (bell ringing) Ooh, gotta run. I've got a class. You come and see me if you need anything, okay? - Okay. - B.J. - [B.J.] Hi. - Something wrong? - [B.J.] No, couldn't sleep. How was your meeting? - [Bob] Noisy. Nice night. - Daddy, do you miss Mom? Daddy? - [Bob] Hmm? - Do you miss Mom? - Very much. - Me too. - What's the matter, Peaches? - Nothing, really. Just been thinking about her. - Well, I better hit the sack. - Good night. Oh, I almost forgot, Aunt Marge called. - Anything important? - No, just the usual. - B.J. - Well, she makes me nervous. I always feel like I'm talking to Billy Graham's mother. - Your Aunt Marge is good lady. - I'm not making fun of her, really. I'll just never forget her blubbering all over me at Mom's funeral about you becoming a Christian. - I always wondered about that. - What? - Why you didn't accept Christ? That night we all talked. - I don't know. Just didn't see the point. Didn't change anything. - Why do you say that? - Daddy, I gave up dolls a long, long time ago. I'm a big girl now. All grown up. And it's like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny all over again. - So, who's talking about mud pies and tea parties? B.J., Jesus was a real person. Just as real as Julius Caesar or George Washington. - You're really worried. That's sweet, but come on, Daddy. You know me better than that. I didn't mean I don't believe in God. Good grief, I'm a Sunday School veteran. But, Christ, God, it's all the same thing, isn't it? - Well, yes and no. Who'd Jesus claim to be? God's Son. - [B.J.] So? - So, you've got to accept what Jesus the Son did on the cross in order to have a relationship with God the Father. The fact that He died for your sins. - [B.J.] It's really confusing. Ever see those guys on TV? Saved, born again. Sounds like a foreign language. - Maybe it does it a way. Let me put this differently. - Daddy, I've got my whole life to worry about things like that. I'm not going anywhere. Besides, it's late. I'm tired, okay? - Well, maybe some other time. - [B.J.] Sure. Toodles. - Good night, Peaches. (ambulance siren wailing) - [EMT] Sorry. - Hey, watch where you're goin', huh? Hey, where's Reasoner? - X-ray. - Seen this? - Hmm? - Look, it's no skin off my nose, but you gotta look at this. - Trouble. - I warned ya. - I wonder who could have leaked it? - Who do you think? I wonder if Griff's heard? - Reasoner, uh huh. - Stupid. Stupid. - Okay. He's heard. (knocking on door) Morning, Griff. - Bob. Drink? - No, thank you. - Oh yeah, I keep forgetting, born again, right? - I've seen the paper. - Have you now? So? What do you think? - Well, I didn't read the whole story. - No need, the chairman of the committee should know all about it. Your work being chairman doesn't mean much these days, does it? Hospital committee fights abortion. That ought to sell a few papers. - [Bob] I was going to come to you with this. - Oh, is that right? - You've known how I've felt for some time. - Doctor, this is a public hospital. If the public wants a certain kind of service, it's our job to give it to them. - No matter what. - We've been friends a long time, Bob. I used to admire your eclecticism. - Griff, why can't you understand we can't go on like this? Eroding away, bit by bit, everything we stand for. - And why can't you understand? It's not our choice. We serve the community. Why don't you do your job like the rest of us? Take your check and go. You know, you'd be amazed at how easy it is. - I can't do that. - I guess we have nothing more to talk about. Bob. I've stood up for you in the past, but enough's enough. Take my advice, back off. - I'm right about this, you know that. - It's not worth it. And you'll find religion makes a lousy crutch. - That's where you're wrong. It's not a crutch. You know, for the first time in my life, I've discovered something more important than this hospital. - The board's meeting tomorrow at six. - I'll be there. Griff, I accept full responsibility. - You'll get it. - [B.J.] Say, Daddy? - [Bob] Yeah? - [B.J.] Can I ask you something? - [Bob] Sure. - Well, I have this friend, you see, and she's a really nice girl. It seems she and her boyfriend, you know. - Know what? - You know. - Oh, that, you know. - Now it seems she's, oh, this is really embarrassing. - Oh. - You know what I'm talking about? - I take it that she's pregnant. - Yeah, well, sort of. - You know, I've been in medicine almost 30 years and I've yet to see anyone who is sort of pregnant. - Oh, I knew I shouldn't of asked you about this. - Now, don't get your feathers ruffled. Do I know her? - I don't think so. Not well, anyway. - Well, how can I help? - Well, she asked my advice about an abortion. And, uh, see, she's got this chance. This really neat scholarship. Academic scholarship to college. But she'll lose it if she's gotta take off nine months. Besides, she doesn't know anything about being a mother. So, I told her I'd ask your opinion. Maybe you could recommend a good doctor. - Well, I'm sorry, B.J., I can't help her if she wants an abortion. - Why? - Because it's murder. - She's only a couple of months. - Listen, Peaches, right now that baby has all the genetic information necessary for a human being. You don't kill people just because it's inconvenient. It wasn't the child's fault. Look, if you drive your car recklessly and your passenger is killed, you're guilty of manslaughter. Well, your friend is just as responsible for her passenger. Now, I'd be more than happy to help in some other way. I know an adoption agency with a long list of people desperate for children. Do her parents know? - Not yet. - Well, it'll break their hearts. But she should tell them. - But she's scared. This abortion thing seems so easy. - It's not Tanya, is it? - Tanya? Don't be silly, she's dumb, but not that dumb. - Tell you what, I've got a book that shows the development of a baby from conception to birth. Amazing photographs taken inside the womb. Let me see if I can find it. - Gotta run. - I can't imagine what I did with it. Could be at the office, I'll check tomorrow. - No big deal. - Hmm? Yeah, sure. - Oh, you're still here. Oh, I don't know what we're gonna do with Jamie. She just can't seem to learn those lines. She has trouble every time. Well, you'll be able to cover for her, won't you? What's the matter? - Do, do you think abortion's wrong? - No. I don't. It isn't human life. Not yet. It's just a part of you. And nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your own body. Look, B.J., I know what you're going through. I read the papers. - This has nothing to do with my father. - Oh, good. Because he isn't going to go through nine months of hell. So, who are you gonna do it for then? The embryo? That's ridiculous. It won't know or care. So who? Billy? - Will you go with me? - I could get into a lot of trouble for this, you know that? I've already gotten more involved than I should. - I don't have anybody else. - [B.J.] Hi. - Hi, hon. - What are you looking for? - Hmm? - What are you looking for? - Oh, some papers, got a meeting, it's important. - Oh. So, how are things? - Hmm? - At the hospital? - What about it? - How are things? - Fine. Hectic. - Mmm. I thought I might spend the night with Tanya tonight. - Yeah, sure. Well, I'm off. Wish me luck. - Good luck. - Almost forgot, found the book. Let me know what you think. See ya. - How do you feel? - Can I speak to you a moment, please? - Yes. - See that she gets two of these twice a day. She said she was going to be staying with you now? - Yes. - Well, she kind of had a rough time with it. But there should be no side effects. However, if there's any unusual bleeding or high-grade fever, here's the number you can call. - Thank you. - You're welcome, goodbye now. - Goodbye. How do you feel? - Lousy. I saw it. - What'd you say? - I saw it. They tried to hide it, but I saw it. Oh, dear God. - B.J., now hush. Oh. Stop it. Now, listen to me, you were only two months, you couldn't have seen anything, it was too small. And even if you did, what difference would it make? It was just tissue, a cancer. People don't cry over cancers, they cut them out. Now, come on, it's over, put it behind you. - Can you pull into that gas station? - What's the matter, are you sick? - No, just want to stop. - Okay. Want me to go with you? - No. (sobbing) - B.J.? B.J., are you all right? B.J. - I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I just want to go home. - Okay, come on, I'll help you - I'm all right. - Have you home in a jiffy. - I don't want to go to your place, I just want to go home. - Oh, do you think that's wise? Your system's had a shock. - I'm fine. I just want to go home. - Really, B.J., you have your own-- - I want to go home! Now. - Okay, all right. Just don't get upset, we're going. (sentimental music) - [Board Member] Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Reasoner. - [Bob] Good evening. - This is an informal meeting, doctor. The board would simply like to hear your side. - Well, I appreciate that. I've tried to get together some material. The types of things that we've been working on. I think when you read these, you'll see the tremendous support that exists for a resolution here at Dickens. - Dr. Reasoner, we're not here to read a bunch of propaganda. All we're interested in is what you intend to do about our current problem. - I see. - Dr. Reasoner, you've been here over 20 years. Surely you see the sticky situation we're in. - I assure you ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Reasoner's amply aware of our problem. I, for one, would like to hear what he intends to do about it. - Exactly what would you have me do? - Disband your committee. We'll release a joint statement to the press, no conflicts, no problems, we're all one, big, happy family. - There is no committee. Anyway, it's a little late for that. - You know, there's one small point you fellows seem to have overlooked. We're all businessmen here. Membership on this board is an honorary thing. Take that away, and what's the point? - That's right, I've already been getting calls from people getting a good laugh out of this. - What would this resolution say? - That life comes from God. That our God-given talents are dedicated to sustaining, nurturing, and protecting those who come under our care. That we will never perform nor permit abortion, euthanasia, infanticide, or any like thing in this hospital. - That it? - That's it. - Now, what's the matter with that? We don't do any of those things, do we? - Well, not officially, but, uh. Those decisions are usually left to the family members and the attending physician. - You're a lawyer, what are the legal ramifications? - Our problem comes from the state and Fed monies we have in our research program. That and the fact we're a public hospital. - We could get sued? - For starters. It's just not worth the hassle. Besides losing our research funds, think about getting sued by a 14-year-old rape victim. - You think we've got problems now. - I'm ready to vote. - On what? Nobody's made a motion. - Then I move that we vote on his resolution. - Bob, are you willing to stand by the board's decision? - I haven't presented my material. - I've heard all I need to hear. - Can I say just one thing before you vote? - If you'll be brief. - I'll be brief. I'm a Christian. You all know that. The more I read my Bible, the more I see people through God's eyes, the better I understand the value He places on each of us, everybody, from embryo to old age, is of infinite value to God. Now, I love this hospital. I've given 20 years of my life to her. But, please understand I can not be a part of anything that God's against. If this board denies this resolution I will have to resign as chief of staff. - Well, you seem to have put some thought in this. I admire you for standing up for your beliefs. There's a motion on the floor. Do I have a second? - Second. - A motion has been made and seconded. That this hospital adopt the policy outlined by Dr. Reasoner. All those in favor raise your right hand please. Those opposed, like sign. Motion denied. Well, doctor, 20 years is a long time. You deserve a rest. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, Dr. Reasoner? - [Bob On Phone] Yes. - Um, this is Vicky Stewart, B.J.'s drama teacher. - Oh, yes, how are you? - Fine, listen, I'm sorry to bother you so late. But, may I speak to B.J.? - Sure. I'm sorry, I forgot, she's spending the night with a friend. - Oh, um, well, she was supposed to, but I think she changed her mind. Can I speak to her? It's important. - I just walked in the door, can you hold on a second? - [Vicky On Phone] Sure. (knocking on door) (sentimental music) - B.J.? B.J.? Oh my God. (car tires screeching) Come on, B.J., you gotta wake up. (car tires screeching) (sentimental music) - Dr. Reasoner? - Who's on the floor? - Dr. Leaventhal. - Get him, stat. - Yes, sir. - [Nurse On Intercom] Dr. Leaventhal to one, Dr. Leaventhal. - [Nurse] What have we got? - [Bob] OD, Nembutal, I'm not sure how much. - [Nurse] Those 20 mils. - [Bob] Gotta assume she took them all. - [Nurse] Any idea how long it's been? - [Bob] Two, maybe three hours. - [Nurse] Not good. - [Bob] Help me incubate her. Let's get an IV going. - You got it. - [Bob] Give me vital signs and neuros every five minutes. All right, let's get the tube now. - [Nurse] Coils nice. - [Bob] Swallowing. - Respiration eight, pressure 90 over 60. - [Bob] Just a little bit more. - Pulse weak. - [Bob] That's my girl. That's it, hang in there. Tape. All right, let's get her intubated. - What have we got goin' here? - [Nurse] OD. - I thought it was your night off? - [Bob] It's my daughter. - Want me to take over? - No, just stay close, I may need you. - You got it. - [Bob] Vital signs? - [Nurse] Pressure 80 over 50 and falling. Pulse 50, skin cool and clammy. - Know what it was? - Barbiturate, Nembutal. 20, maybe 100 milligrams. - How long? - [Bob] Two, three hours. Let's get her started on some Mannitol, 500 cc's. What's her pressure? - [Nurse] 60 over 40 and still falling. Pulse difficult to palpate. Cardiac rhythm irregular. - Don't give up on me. You're all I've got left. - [Nurse] I'm not getting a blood pressure, we're losing her. She's arresting. - Crash cart. - Fill 'em up, stat. All right, raise them up. Stand back. (grunting) - Nothin'. - [Bob] Cardiac needle. 10 cc's epinephrine. Well, where's that injection? - Coming. - [Bob] Give me an amp sodium bicarb, let's hit her again. Come on, move. Stand back. - Bob, it's no good. - It hasn't been long. - You know it has. (sentimental music) - I won't let her die. - It's not your choice. - Leave me alone, get out of here if you won't help. (sentimental music) - Please, God, please. - Bob, look, you gotta stop. - Leave me alone. Get me 10 cc's 10% calcium gluconate IV. (sentimental music) - She's, she's gone. Let her go. - I don't want to hear that. - Stop it, doctor, you know the signs. - She's my daughter. - I, I understand. If there were anything on God's earth I could do, I'd do it, but, there isn't. Dr. Reasoner, your patient is dead. (sentimental music) (sobbing) - (sobbing) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. (sobbing) (sobbing) God forgive me. (sobbing) It's my fault, not hers. (sobbing) - Come on, let's get out of here. - [Nurse] Doctor. Oh dear God. - Thermic. - [Nurse] Got it. - You got a pulse? - [Nurse] Weak. - [Bob] Pressure? - [Nurse] 60 over 40 and climbing. - Give me 50 milligrams lidocaine. - I don't believe it. (sentimental music) (sobbing) - Can I get you something? B.J. - Just let me alone. - I want to help. - It's too late. - Please. I want to help you. - You don't understand. I had an abortion. An abortion. - I know. Miss Steward came by a little while ago. - You don't hate me? - No. I hate what you did, but I don't hate you. - Oh, Daddy, it hurts so much. - I know. I know it does, Peaches. If I could make it go away, I would. But it's done. You know, I'm just sitting here, thinking over what went wrong. And I've come up with some pretty lousy conclusions. Remember the other night when I asked you why you never accepted Christ, and you said, what's the point? What's the point? Nothing would change. But there was me, wasn't it? I never changed. Not in ways that were important to you. - It's not your fault. - Yeah, well, you made one big mistake, never, never judge Christ by me. B.J., God's not gonna spot you 10 points for having a lousy father. He loves you. If you keep denying Him, you don't leave Him any choice. - Will you pray for me? - No. But I'll pray with you. - I don't know what I'm supposed to say. - Words aren't important. Just tell God what's on your heart. - Emptiness. Pain. I feel so crummy. So dirty. I just wanted somebody to love me. I never wanted to hurt you. I'm so sorry. How you or God can forgive me. But I want you to. More than anything. If Jesus is who you say He is, if He can do the things that you say He can, then I want Him in my life. But I don't know how to ask Him. Will He hear me? - He already has. - Really? - It's beginning. - What happens now? - You can start over. Start fresh. - Oh, Daddy. I love you so much. - And I love you too, Peaches.
