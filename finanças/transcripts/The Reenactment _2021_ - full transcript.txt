[♪] [♪] [♪] [man] What are we doing right now? Unpacking kitchen supplies. Somebody call Robin Leach. [man] Should we raise a toast? [♪] [♪] - Got a little Gran Spumante. - [chuckles] - Crack that open. - Yeah. - Fancy. - I think this is one of the good ones. They're all good. They have sparkles. Yeah. [indistinct dialog] [♪] Perfect. Yeah. Absolutely need it after all the unpacking. My God. [indistinct dialog] - [sighs] - Got it. All right, watch out. - [cork pops] - [laughing] [♪] - All right, here we go. - Yay! - Bubbly? - We don't do this enough. What's up with that? You're working too hard. You're working too hard. - You're right, I'm working too hard. - You are. [chuckling] [indistinct dialog] [♪] All right. - Well... - To our new home. To our new home. [glasses clink] [♪] [♪] [man] Whoa. Whoa. Hey! [♪] [narrator] There is the world that we know. And there's the world of the impossible... and the unknown. These two worlds are often closer than we think, and with your help, we can uncover the real truths. behind these myths... and mysteries. [♪] Coming up: crop circles in Nebraska. The work of aliens or a mischievous dog? Are fungus networks the future of Wall Street? Cattle mutilations in the American Southwest. Can an Ohio woman legally marry a ghost? Up next on Myths & Mysteries. [♪] [♪] [woman] Not long after my husband left, I felt a presence in the house. I came home late from work one night, and all of the cabinets and drawers in the kitchen were slamming open and shut. - [rattling] - [screaming] At first, it was terrifying. [door squeaks] Yes, uh, she called me real late one night after a bowling tournament, and said to come over immediately. So I just figured she wasn't used to staying by herself or anything like that. After that deadbeat husband took off on her... whew, what an asshole. He wanted to be an actor, ran off to Hollywood. - We could be famous, couldn't we, old Peter? - [cat meows] I think it's some kind of ghost. It's not a ghost. It's probably your ex-husband messing with you. Could be bowling right now. [Elizabeth] What I felt in the kitchen that night wasn't evil. It was trying to reach out to me, to communicate. And that's when I saw him for the first time. [paper rustling] Ken! Come here! - Did you see him? - See who? The soldier. He was right there. What soldier? That's when she said she met him. Her soldier. I started seeing him more often. His poetry moved me to my core. He told me his name was Jeremiah Thompson. So I went to the library and looked him up. He had been a casualty in the Battle at Antietam. [whooshing] We believe this to be between a stage three and stage four haunting, all dependent on the degree of... intimacy in the relationship. [whooshing] The legality is crystal clear on most things in regards to interactions with the living and the deceased. But, uh... in this case, um... th... this one is different. It wasn't long before I suggested we made things official. Yeah. She wants to marry it. This is all quite acceptable in other cultures. [sighs] We've had a hard time finding a priest. [♪] - Hey, Jane. - [keyboard clacking] - What? - Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't interrupting you, was I? You are, actually. Oh. The police tape came in. Can you just give me a minute to finish this? Yeah, if you can tell me where Hannah is. [chuckles] Oh, boy. And then let her know I'm on the way, that way I can make one of those grand entrances. I just want to make sure that it doesn't interfere with your work. Yeah, it's all about the work, yes, the work. Okay? You don't have to worry about anything, Jane, because I am a professional. Well, marriage is also work, and you're recently divorced, so just want to make sure you get your head on straight. Did you hear something? Did you hear something? No, I heard something? Alan, I'm serious, I definitely heard something outside. - [knocking] - There's a knock at the door. You're not supposed to be here. Oh, God, Alan, what are we supposed to do? Uh, "Travis, tie up the girl," - Alan says... - Over my dead body. Bang! Your boyfriend just got shot in the head. [screaming] [screaming continues] It was good work. Thank you for coming in. - Yeah, no problem. - [Jane] Yeah, I like your T-shirt. Thank you, it's... yeah, I just got it, so... - [Jane] Great. - I like your... I don't know what that is but I like it. [man] Collins crime scene tape. This is the walk-up. As you can see, no signs of breaking and entering. Door appears to be unlocked. Yep. Blood on door frame. Master bedroom. The primary crime scene. Bodies were covered when we arrived. Not sure by who. Murder weapon appears to be left on premises. The double-barreled shotgun. Approximately $150? Yeah. Was recovered from where it had been left on the stove. Male victim, shot. Female victim... appears to have been stabbed by the same double-barreled shotgun. Lovingly brandished by my partner here. Wrapping it up like a bouquet for your sweetie, just because. - [tape ejecting] - [Jane] Whoo! They seem professional. [man] Don't let them investigate my murder. [chuckles] Honestly, the crime scene photos are way worse. Yeah, those Wallach brothers were some real sick bastards. I think this is probably top five most gruesome murders we've covered. Hm, yeah, the shot, it's up if you want to take a look. - Yeah. - Thank you. I like the fog. Yeah, we should probably re-haze before shooting, actually. Yeah, at least we agree on something. Uh, looks nice, though. Definitely feels mysterious. Yo, you need some help with all that? I think I'm good. Did you get a receipt? Yeah, I got a deal on some of it, actually. Ah, good for you. Thanks. Hey, where's the boss man? I need to mic him up again. [Jane] Uh, Gordon, could you take Phil down the hall to wardrobe? Hey, Phil, did you win those Mudhoney tickets? Fuck no, bro. They said I was, like, three callers away, but I got a rad shirt, though. You listen to Mudhoney, too? Shut the fuck up, Gordon. Well, it's nice to know you at least came close. Eh, I guess so. Did you get granola bars? Gonna see if there's some. You got the receipt. Yeah, camera's basically ready. All right. We got everything ready for location tomorrow? Yep, we got the batteries, backup batteries, tapes, extra reels, the works. - Mm. - We're all packed up and ready to go. You want a granola bar? Is this a reward for all my hard work, Jane? It's more like a half-hearted substitute, 'cause I know that you skipped a meal to get everything done. You know, that's very generous and kind of you. I gladly accept. I have my moments. I'm not a tyrant. Judy Hines is alive and living in Omaha. I still don't know what that means. [Jane] Sorry to keep you waiting. [man] You know, we get paid to wait, not to act. [Phil] [laughing] That shit's funny. You know, I'm so sorry to hear about those Mudhoney tickets, I'm gonna work something out. So, you think we can knock out the rest of these segments? Oh, really? And then you're gonna be able to let me go, is that what you're saying? Finally? - Promise. - Okay. We, on the other hand, get to shoot the re-enactments tomorrow. Hey, man, you think you can hook me up with, like, uh, you know, whoever has it? - Mm-hm. - Okay. Okay, we gotta get started because I've already started, uh, drinking. [chuckles] That's not... That's not true. Ah, I do like the fog. You're standing a little awkward. I'm in the same place I always am, right? [man] He's fucking handsome, he's like, uh, Billy Dee Williams. [Jane] Okay, I'm gonna interpret that as ready. Ready, Wilbur? Uh, sound. [Phil] Wango tango. - [man] Camera speed. - [Jane] All right. - Wango Tango. - Ready, Wilbur? [Wilbur] All right, let's do it. [clears throat] I'm a Shakespearean actor, but it's okay. - Deep breath. - Excuse me, is this a new PA? - [Jane] Yeah, he's new. - Uh, sir, sir. It's blank. You need to turn the whole thing around. - Pardon? - Oh, uh, wrong cards. Gordon, flip it around. So much to dwell in a dungeon cell, growing thin and wizened in a solitary prison, it's a poor lookout for a soldier stout... All right, we ready? Guys still rolling? [Wilbur] Keep it straight, kid, don't get nervous, all right? There's the world that we know. And there's the world of the impossible... and unknown. These two worlds are often closer than we think, and with your help, we can uncover the real truth behind these myths and mysteries. And cut. That was nice. I think we can mark that and move on. - Camera cuts. - [Jane] Good. No, it was really good. Did I say it right? Yeah. Every time you say those lines, it gets better and better. Do we always have to wear this freakin' trench coat? I feel like McGruff, the crime dog. It goes with the backdrop really well. - Studio loves it. - You know what? I... I have a really nice sweater collection. I did not know that. [Wilbur] Because you never asked. All right? March 15, 1985, Sumner County, Tennessee. At 4:54 p.m., two men in ski masks, both carrying shotguns, robbed the First National Bank of Tennessee. They fled the scene in a green 1976 Pontiac Catalina with $34,000 in cash. The two men were quickly identified as Travis and Randall Wallach, also known as the Wallach brothers. They were already wanted for multiple bank robberies in surrounding areas. The Wallach brothers headed straight for their designated safe house Unbeknownst to them, a young married couple named Alan and Sandra Collins had recently purchased the property and were currently spending their first night alone in their new home. On the following morning, Alan and Sandra Collins were found dead on the floor of their master bedroom by the moving company. The sheer brutality of what they found was almost unimaginable. Alan had been shot in the face at point blank range, and Sandra had been stabbed multiple times by the same shotgun. A handful of marked bills left neatly stacked on the kitchen counter was all that remained of the Wallach brothers. Their whereabouts... remain unknown. Cut. I think we got that. You're damn right we got it. Judy Hines is alive and living in Omaha! - [feedback squealing] - Oh. All right, it peaked a little at the end there. - [Jane] Sorry about that. - [woman] Who's Judy Hines? [Jane] It's just a thing he says. - My mom knew a Judy Hines. - Shut the fuck up, Gordon. [man on radio] Okay, we got a 1990 Chevy van. The number is 544... [Gordon] What's up, buddy? My car's busted and now I gotta ride to the studio with you? [Gordon] It was my idea. Jane wanted to make you call a cab. Yeah, that sounds like Jane. I gotta stop and get gas, though. Fuck it. Put this in. Sure. What is it? Just fuckin' listen to it. [man] This is where the experience of yourself comes... This Mudhoney? Goddammit, Gordon, just fuckin' drive! Bet it is Mudhoney. [♪] So, what happened next? Oh. We gave them the money. - [Jane] Hm. - I mean, that's the normal procedure in these kinds of situations. Were you scared for your life? Well, I was scared at first, but then they just seemed kind of desperate. Oh. So, when do we get to the big scene? Just a minute. So... two bank robbers wearing ski masks pointing a shotgun at your face, what was going through your mind at that point? I mean, did you see your whole life flash before your eyes? Um... they didn't really point the guns at anyone. - [Jane] But... - I don't think they wanted to use 'em. But you saw your life flash before your eyes. Right? Well, the whole time I was thinking I just wanted to get back to my family. I mean, obviously, they're violent. I mean, especially when you look at what they did to that poor young couple. We're gonna cut on that. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Doug. Really great work. Yeah. [Doug] Thank you so much. I'm so glad I finally got to meet you. This is one of my favorite shows. Nice to meet you, too. I wish it had been under different circumstances, you know, without crime, but, uh... [chuckles] [Doug] Oh, that's okay, I'm a huge fan of the show. - I... I love it. - Oh, yeah. - Love the bow tie. - Thanks. - [Jane] Yeah. - It was a gift last year. - [man] Nice. - [Jane] Do that yourself or... Um, you know, I... I can, not... not this one, but I... I can do it. [Jane] You can get yourself dressed? - That's great. - Absolutely. [man 1] Everybody get down on the ground! This is a robbery! [man 2] Hands flat on the floor where we can see 'em! [man 1] We don't need any heroes today. [man 2] Where's the manager? [Jane] And cut! - [man 3] Cutting. - [Jane] Okay. Uh, that was pretty good. I think we're ready to flip around. - Okay. - Yeah. Thank you. - All right. - Hey, guys, how'd that feel? - [man 1] You think I did okay? - Yeah, you were really great. You totally can feel your emotion coming through that mask. - [man 2] I have to wear this the whole time? - Yeah. Well, yeah, we kind of wanted our faces seen in this. Well, they're gonna get taken off at the house, so... Do I have to wear it all the way to the house, or can I take it off in between takes? Hey, do you want to move this all the way up on the counter and then cover the rest of this thing from there? Yeah, I mean, we're not punching in that much, so we don't have to get quite as much coverage, but I think it'd be good from there. All right, well, everything's lit up, just give me the word. - Appreciate it. - Audio's clutch on that, too. - Thank you. - Hey, Gordon. Gordon. - Yeah. - Okay, um... Can you help me, uh, move these sticks over there? Do you mind if I just get a quick touch up on everyone? Yeah, and make sure you do Bill over here as well, too. - Okay, great. - That's Bill. Thank you. - Jane. - Yeah? Where did you want me to stand in this scene, 'cause I'm... - Oh, we actually have someone to play the bank manager. That's Bill. That's movie you. - [chuckles] - Yeah. Hey, do I have any lines? Uh, let me... You do have one. - You have, um... - [man] Hey, shot's up when you have a second. You're gonna say, "Please, there's no need for violence." And when do I say that? Um... I gonna let you run it with, uh, Nick and... Nick and Charlie. Is that it? Yeah, I'm gonna let you run it with those guys for a little bit. Okay? - Okay, thanks. - They'll tell you what to do. - Hey, I'm just gonna lock this here. - Perfect. - [Bill] Please, there's no need for violence. - Yeah, see, I can do that. - Hey, hey, look. If it makes you feel better, I'll let you play me sometime. I got a court date next week. Then I hold this shotgun up to you and I go, uh, just give us the money and nobody's gotta get hurt. - Is that loaded? - Of course, it's not loaded. Why are you still here? It's like a rule this can't be real. - Hey. - Huh? - Camera? Rolling? - Oh, yeah, ready to roll. - Ready to roll, yeah. - And sound? Sound speed. All right, Charlie, Charlie, remember that you and Nick are gonna start from off camera, and then you're gonna enter into frame, okay? - Ready. - All right, let's do this. - [door opens] - [bell dings] Uh, everybody hold first position. [man] Camera cutting. - Uh, can I help you? - Isn't this a bank? [Jane] It's closed today. I'm so sorry. I went to the van for, like, one second, and she... Ma'am, it's Sunday, so we're closed. Gordon, can you just get her out of here? Well, I never! Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. - I'll see myself out. - [Doug] Come back tomorrow. Gordon, do not let anyone else through that door. Not now, not ever, not 'til we are done shooting or I will fire you. - She is a really loyal customer. - I'm sure she is. All right, guys, can we just do this please? - [man] Yep. - Camera speed, let's do it. - Sound speeds. - Looks are good. All right, and actors, ready? And action! [Nick] Open the safe or we start shootin' bow ties! Please, there's no need for violence. [Charlie] Just give us the money and nobody gets hurt. - [Jane] And cut! - [man] Cutting. Okay, I'm happy with that. That was a good take. We'll maybe do one more for safety. You're right, he is sweating a lot. - A lot. - I love the bow tie, though. - Yeah. - You're doing great. I think we should fire Gordon. [man on radio] I got a 1982 Ford F-150 pickup truck. - I got a Murray lawnmower. - [man 2] Okay. A Ford truck and a Murray lawnmower. [man 1] I'm also looking for a... for a Remington shotgun. [man 2] Oh, he's lookin' for a... he's lookin' for a shotgun. [man 1] A Remington shotgun. So this is us, huh? [Jane] You know, guys, I think probably the best bet is to just stage everything out here. They really nailed that casting. Look at that stud. Ha, ha. That's cute. You guys have natural chemistry. It's all part of the job. - [door squeaks] - Also, to let you know, we plan to have the frame up in about 30, so then we're just gonna knock these shots off real quick. - All right? Be ready. - So is this your main gig or do you work on a lot of other shows? Hey, Gordon. Do you have the key? I gave it to you earlier. Oh, you know... That's right, you did. Sorry. My bad. Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything you said. [door creaks] [♪] [crickets chirping] This what they call a real fixer upper, huh? Uh, you needed to use the bathroom, right? Copy that. Unless you want it on the floor. That way, down the hall. [actor] Hey, has anyone ever been murdered in there? Not yet. - [footsteps approaching] - [floor creaking] Do you think it's worth it for me to make the move out to L.A.? You know, I don't think I'm necessarily who you should be asking for advice. [♪] What's that in the corner? [man] Hey, Jane, did the realtor say anything... That there would be a real ass dead squirrel? No. Or a passing reference to a rodent problem? No, I would have remembered that. Are those wires sticking out of it? What are you thinking? That is a dead animal. - I have a stick. - Thank you, Gordon. - [all exclaiming] - [coughing, gagging] [Jane] It's definitely dead. Well, has anyone tried plugging it in? - What? - Just... Wango tango, salsa, cha-cha, whatever, I'm out. I don't think we're insured for this. [whirring] - [clapping] - Whoo! You know, some folks, they would interpret this as an omen. You know, finding a dead animal on the set and whatnot. I just want to finish this and get out of here before it gets too late. Jane, it's just an old house. You can't let some homeless guy's little science project - get you all shook up. - It was creepy. No, it was... it was a calc-u-squirrel. - Squirrelulator. Got one in my office. - Stop. No cute names for it. Um, just see if that one works. All right, well, apologies in advance if something breaks. Striking. There you go. One down. [Jane] Do you think there's a possibility of us breaking something? Wouldn't that be something that you should already know? I just want to know if we're gonna blow a fuse or not? Well, we shouldn't, but you never know when it comes to old houses like this. That's why we usually bring a generator. [indistinct audio transmission] [static] Gordon! What the motherfuck! I just wanted to say, uh... good thinking with the... the shovel idea and all. [metal clanks] Pick it up. - I told you not to bother him. - Yeah. You're doing a really good job. Thanks. Go get 'em, killer. What time do the movers get here in the morning? Not 'til about noon. Fuck! [sighs] I see you've been terrorizing Gordon. Oh, God, Gordon's the fucking worst, though. He tries so hard. Hey, you wanna listen to something? [cassette rattling] What's that? I don't know, let's find out. [♪] I usually listen to Lisa Loeb and Tracy Chapman. Oh, yeah, I'm not really into that at all. Okay. [♪] - Who is it? - Well, uh, I have band. Get outta here! Yeah, uh, look, I... I don't really like to talk about it. - It's good. - Yeah? [music stops] I don't have it. I don't have it yet. - Can we take that one again? - Sure. All right, back to one. What time do the movers get here in the morning? Not 'til about noon. [clears throat] You've gotta be kidding me. That's where I found it. Didn't Jane say that all the yard stuff was stored downstairs against the fire wall? Does that look like somewhere I would willingly go? It's all part of the job, Gordon. Okay, fine. I believe in you. [♪] [rattling] [rattling continues] [man] Woo! - [Gordon screams] - Fuckin' nailed it. Sorry, guys, I just... This is... This is really hard, you know? This is tough. Let's just pick it up from there if we can. Can we? Oh, uh... [clears throat] Plenty of time to celebrate. Hey, here's to new beginnings. - Damn it! - Woo-hoo-hoo! Maybe I'm just not cut out for this, you know? I don't know. - What do you think? - I don't think they'll mind. [Nick] Who cares? You die first anyway. Seriously? Ahh. I just love Dean Koontz books. [paper rustling] So honestly, that's all you need to know about basic three-point lighting. - Oh, that's interesting. - Yeah. Uh, so, Kevin, are we almost ready? Uh... yeah, just about. A little hungry, though. Yeah, do we have any crafty? Actually, Jane has some granola bars in her pocket. Um, I think we have some granola bars in the van. I just thought maybe we'd get food on the way out. Well, with the way things are going, we will not be out of here soon. Okay, well, that's fantastic news. But camera's ready as soon as the actors get here. That's fine. I'm gonna send Gordon out, uh, for food. Gordon! Gor? - Yes? - [Kevin] Oh, my G... Oh, my God! - Are you okay? - I'm good. I get these sometimes. Gordon, hey. It's okay, man. What happened? Stepped on a nail. Hey, guys, there's some, uh, weird blood stains on the floor in there and... [chuckles] Oh, shit. I think you should go to the hospital. I've already got the keys. Yeah, drag your own dumb ass to the hospital. Hey, Phil, that's harassment. It's not harassment if he actually sucks. But you should go apologize to him, he's very clearly in pain. Oh, shit, he's actually leaving. Oh, no. Gordon! You know, that Gordon, he could never catch a break. [Jane] Gordon, can you come back with some pizza? [insects chirping] [Gordon grunts] [engine starts] [man on radio] ...1980 GMC Jimmy. [engine revs] [man 2 on radio] Okay, got a GMC Jimmy and... [insects chirping] I just can't get out of my own head about this, man. Told you I was in an Ernest movie, right? - What? - I was in an Ernest movie. Like Ernest Goes To Cam? Eh, Goes To Jail, but yeah, same Ernest. - Okay, so you were in an Ernest movie. - Yep. Yeah, one day I was having some troubles with some of my lines, - so Jim, you know, Ernest... - I know who Jimmy V. is. Well, Jim takes me to the side and he says, "Son, I'm gonna give you the best piece of acting advice you're ever gonna hear." What did he say? He told me that great acting is great casting. - Great acting is great casting? - Yep. Well, actually, he said, "If you want a Bigfoot, hire a Bigfoot," but I'm pretty sure I knew what he meant. Know what I mean, Vern? You think Vern knew what he meant? Hm... [chuckles] This is weird. - Well? - Go ahead. [Phil] All right. [door creaks] [♪] [creaking] [gasping] Oh, my God. [laughing] Just kidding. [Phil] Fuck you. - Oh, my... - Your face was awesome. Don't tell me this place creeps you out. I mean, a little. How long have you worked on this show? We normally do, like, UFOs or alligators in the sewer or, like, ghosts, things that aren't real, and people died here. That alligator stuff is real. [sighs] I... I keep hearing things. Like what? - Come on, tell me. - I don't know. Like what? It's like shuffling. Like feet shuffling. Did it sound like itty bitty little gator feet? [laughing] Fuck me. I'm an idiot. Ugh. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please don't leave me in this creepy room all by myself. It's just weird, okay? I guess it's not that strange. [Phil] What, the little baby alligator? [chuckles] No. No, it just reminds me of something that happened where I grew up. Why do I feel like I'm about to hear the rest of this story? There was this family that left for church one morning. While they were gone, this guy with an axe climbed into their attic. He waited for them to all go to sleep. He just waited and then when they did go to sleep, he came downstairs and he murdered them one by one. Okay, yeah, so it's like a feel good story. But that's not the part that creeps me out. Oh, why, 'cause that... that part was just fine? The part that creeps me out was that he just lived there for days with them before anybody came to look for them. I would have been so fine if you just left that part out. And when they did come to look for them, they found a fire still burning. So I'm assuming they never found the killer? I don't know. Although I did hear that he likes to hide behind small doors. Oh, get outta here. [♪] I feel like we might have covered that, actually. Um, it was the Villisca Axe Murders? - Yeah. - Right, yeah. Is that why you're here, you like all the creepy shit? Sure. Let's say that. No, I mean, why are you actually here? Do I need a reason? I feel like everybody here is overqualified. So, why are you here? I'm just complacent. The show keeps runnin', I keep cashing the checks. There's no shortage of mysteries in the world. It's also a good place to meet clients for your side gig. Ah, yes. - You wanted some weed. - Yes, thank God. Also, if anybody asks, you got this from Kevin. - Totally. - Cool. You know my dad went to jail for selling this stuff. - No shit. - It wasn't my fault. Sorry about your dad. What, uh... What prison? We actually shot at a few. Allendale. It's in South Carolina. Do you get to visit him? Uh, not recently. He does watch the show, though. All right, I'm gonna go find somewhere to smoke this. Oh, uh, don't go too far from the house. Uh, I'm sure that squirrel's gonna attract some coyotes. [sighs] First big role? No, I've done background in a couple commercials. Oh. That's cool. Am I that obviously inexperienced or... No, this is the biggest thing that I've booked myself. It's why I asked. - Wait. Really? - Relax. No, no, no, like, you're good, I mean it. Like, really good. Thank you. You know I'm not that good of an actor. Yeah. You're fucking horrible. [scoffs] [laughs] Are you ready outside? - [actor] Let's rock. - [actress] Ready. - Okay, can we roll on camera? - Yeah, camera speed. - Sound? - Sound speeds. And action. [door creaks] What time do the movers get here in the morning? Not 'til about noon. Plenty of time to celebrate. Hey, here's the... Goddammit! Fuckin' shit. And cut on that. - Uh... - Camera's cutting. What is going on with the lights? It's your location. You know, most locations benefit from having... - A generator, right, I know. - Mm-hm. Hey, what's going on with Jonathan? Oh, I... I think he's just a little stressed. He was really good in the audition and rehearsal, though. The lights probably threw him off. - Oh, right, yeah. - [Jonathan] I'm ready. You're ready? Okay. Yeah, get some last looks in there, thank you. - Step up for me, sweetie. - [Jane] Uh, Jonathan, hey, I really love what you're doing. - I'm good. I'm calm. - [Jane] Great work. Yeah. - You're good. You got this. - Yeah. [Jane] Yeah. All right. You feel good? - Yeah. - [Jane] Maybe do some breath work outside. That... I always find that helps. - Okay. - So, all right, he looks great. - All right. - [Jane] Very handsome. - Looks good. - All right, let's get back to one. Okay. [sighs] - [actress] You've got this. - [Jonathan] I'm ready. - [door closes] - [Jane] Actors, are you ready? - [actress] Ready. - [Jonathan] Ready to roll. - Camera? - Camera speeds. - Sound? - [Phil] Wango tango. And action! What time do the movers get here in the morning? Not 'til about noon. Plenty of time to celebrate. And here's to new beginnings. [Jane] And cut! - Yeah. - [Jonathan] How'd I do? Yeah, that was great, it was great, fucking great. - I loved it, yeah. - Camera cuts. - Thank you. - [Phil] Sound cuts. Uh, really nice work, you guys. You look so pretty. Uh, we're gonna do an insert of the champagne. I just don't... I don't trust him with it so, yeah. Great work, though. We're gonna try one more. Uh, but same energy. Great. I loved it. Yeah. So... back outside. Thank you. Alan, I'm serious. I definitely heard something outside. Knock, knock. - You're not supposed to be here. - [Charlie] Yeah. One false move, and I'll blow your brains all over the wallpaper. Oh, God, Alan, what should we do? Travis, tie up the girl. Over my dead body. Bang. You just got shot in the head. - [Nick] And then you... - Then I scream. Hey, did Ernest give you any tips on murdering people? No. But he did tell me how to protect myself from Bigfoot. There aren't enough trees around here. There's, like, several trees. Not enough. [insects chirping] [Jane] So what do you think is going on with the lights? Well, not... the amperage is just fine. I don't know what happened in the other room. We just can't afford to keep blowing takes like that. Hey, also, that kid beefed a line on that last one. This is not an audio conversation. - Also, assistant gaffer. - Right. Like... Like I said, stuff like this just happens with old houses. It's okay, guys. Striking. - Fuck! - [Phil] Well, union break. - I hate that carpet. - Damn it. What is the problem? Where's the breaker box? I think it's probably in the basement. Well, wouldn't that be something that you or the location manager would know? And we don't have a location manager. All right, you could lecture me or you could go fix it. Oh, see, Kevin fixes everything once again. - That's literally your job. - [Kevin] Eh. Kevin is the absolute worst. [Phil] No, Gordon is the absolute worst. - He doesn't have to talk to me. - Right. He doesn't stop talking to me. Oh, he is so obsessed with you. I cannot even handle it. [chuckles] If he tells me about three-point lighting one more time, I am going to lose my mind. He's like a "woe is me" kind of guy. So, you two are gonna be here, and then you two are gonna come in from out there and then hit that mark there. Uh, when do I run off with the money? - Or are we not filming that? - Yeah, we're not filming that. - [Kevin] Hey, Jane. - Yeah? - Have you seen Hannah? - Maybe you should worry about whether or not the lights are working. Oh, you know what? That would be important to do, wouldn't it? Yeah, kind of, we're makin' a movie here, so... All right, well, clear out. Striking. - [switch clicks] - Fuck! - Motherfuck! - Are they still on the same breaker? [Kevin] Yeah, I guess so. Well, go fix it. Well, what other actual option do I have, Jane? Just fucking fix it! Sorry. Hey, guys, you're doing great, um... Maybe a couple deep breaths, it helps. Yeah, sure. Fuck. [Kevin] Phil, Phil, Phil. Excuse me. Assistant gaffer. Can you do me a huge favor and just go check in the laundry room? Just see if the landlord left anything plugged in? - A/C unit. Anything. - Oh, yeah. Hey, Kevin, um, will you go... - Yeah, I'm gonna go. - Yeah, yeah, go do that. Just go. Gimme two minutes. Guys, you can take five. There's some granola bars if you're hungry. Okay, okay, okay. [knocking] Oh... [whirring] Nope. Ah, here we go. [switch clicks] - So are you casting anything else right now? - So Goes To Jail is when - he gets lightning powers - Basically, the way that we cast the show is that, uh, you just have to look like the person that we're trying to... [exhaling] [low rumbling] [whirring] [low rumbling] - [rattling] - [scoffs] Happy Halloween. [electricity humming] - Goes To Jail... - Oh, look, the lights have come on. [buzzing] Why don't we get back into positions, everybody, so we're ready to roll when they come in. You're over there, yeah, gentlemen, you'll start... well, you'll start from outside and then you come in. Yeah. Uh, cheat a little this way. Uh, no, uh, not with your body, just, uh... No, that's still not... just forward facing. Yeah, there, uh... uh, that'll do. Hey, Phil. Hey, did you find anything? Yeah, just a jank ass electrical cord runnin' through the wall in there. - You found a what? - Nothing strange about that, right? Well, it's an old house, so... Look, it... it didn't look old, man. I just... I keep hearing things. Hold on. What do you mean, you're hearing things? Upstairs, like... like there's something moving around up there. Does this place even have an upstairs, bro? Yeah, I went earlier, it's terrifying. Bro, it's probably just some raccoons in the attic or something. I'm not hearing raccoons. I'm tellin' you. You pick up interference on this thing all the time. It's not interference. Look, I just want to get out of here as soon as possible, okay? Well, look, I really don't want to be a dick about this, but I really don't care right now. All right, let's just get the shot and get the hell out of here. All right. We're good to go now. What was the problem? [Kevin] Phil? [Phil] There's no problem. Let's just get the fucking shot. [Jane] Uh, okay. All right. Hey, uh, should we have Hannah in here for last look? I think she's out smoking the pot that Phil gave her. Phil. What the hell? Well, she said she got it from you. Okay, I don't really care what Hannah got or from who, I would just like to roll on this, please. So actors to one, please. You ready?

Oh, no, we gotta get the hell outta here. [Nick] I... I do think there's some, um, weapons down here. - Has to be. - [Charlie] Maybe we can hack our way out. [Hannah] There's at least one shovel. [Charlie] Watch out for the nail. Did you guys see that nail? Okay. What is going on? [gagging] Just try both of them. [switch clicking] [slamming] [muffled screaming] [grunting] [Kevin screaming] Oh, shit! Oh, no.

[crickets chirping] [♪] The events which took place on that fateful evening remain as mysterious as they are shocking. And the reasons behind his murderous actions may never be fully understood. There was always something strange about that house. Are you guys okay? We drove straight to the nearest hospital. We called the police but by the time they got back to the house, the killer was already gone. I guess he just looked around and decided that he'd had enough. I wonder if he watched the show. [Hannah 2] I can't believe we made it. [Phil 2] Gordon, I'm so glad to see you. - [Gordon 2] Oh, my God. - [Phil 2] You're my best friend. Ohh! [♪] As of the airing of this episode, this mysterious killer remains at large, and is considered... extremely dangerous. [♪] [♪ rock] We have an update to this story. The killer was revealed to be a man named Vaughn Bentley who was captured attempting to board a plane in Jacksonville, Florida. And now, is the Loch Ness Monster real, and actually living in Lake Michigan? Next... on Myths & Mysteries. [♪ bagpipe] The legend of the Loch Ness Monster has been told since 565 A.D. but never on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. I know that Loch Ness Monster's out here in this lake somewheres. I seen him one night off my pontoon boat. [♪] Lake Michigan is the second largest of the great lakes. It has a maximum depth of 923 feet, but it has no direct connection to the Atlantic Ocean. So, how did this creature get here? I think some rich hosscat brought him in on a submarine from Scotland and turned him loose. [♪] [Wilbur] In fact, records show that a man did visit Lake Michigan in the 1980s via submersible, but it was merely a scientific project that involved establishing the deepest point of Lake Michigan. Some people say he's just a big old catfish. But I don't care. He's my friend, and I'm gonna catch him. [♪] [man] You can cut it. That was great. Where'd you find this guy? The guy that made love to the Loch Ness Monster? [♪] [host] Don't touch that dial. It's time for some County Trading Post. We currently have several callers waiting. Caller, you're on the air. [♪] [man] I got a 1990 Chevy van with 86,000 miles. I'm asking 1500 for it. The number is 544-6287. [host] Okay, we got a 1990 Chevy van. The number is 544-6287. Again, the number is 544-6287. Thank you. Next, caller, you're on the air. - [man 2] Is it on? - [host] Yes, it is. [man 2] Uh, we can't hear you. [host] It should be. You're on the air. [man 2] Well, we can't hear you. [host] It should be workin'. [man 2] I should just throw my radio out the window. [host] Well, you're on the air. How can I help you? [man 2] Yeah, I got a 1980 GMC Jimmy. I'm askin' 800 for it. I also got some onion boxes. The number is 544-8410. [host] Okay, got a GMC Jimmy and some onion boxes.
