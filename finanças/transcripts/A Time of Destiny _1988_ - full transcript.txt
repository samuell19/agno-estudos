[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] [GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE] [SOLDIER YELLING IN GERMAN] [SOLDIERS SPEAKING IN GERMAN] [SPEAKS IN GERMAN] Fire! [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] SOLDIER 1: Get off the track! SOLDIER 2: Move! Move! SOLDIER 3: Move it! Move it! Move it now! Now! Come on! Move! Fire! [SOLDIER SCREAMS] [♪♪♪] [BIRDS CAWING] SOLDIER: Fall out! [SIGHING] We're gonna make it through this goddamn war. Mm, you bet your sweet ass. JACK: My dearest Josie, I sit and look at your wedding ring and I can see you. It's the only thing that keeps me going sometimes. I believe I'll get home, Jo. Dearest Jo. And when I do, I'm gonna take you back to the old church in San Luis Rey, just like I promised you. I'm gonna put this ring on your finger in front of the same altar. This time when we walk out the door, we'll be starting our new life together. I remember the rain that night. The rain. It all seems so far away to me now. The things that happened that night seem like a dream. Josephina! Josephina! [THUNDER CRASHES] Josephina. Josephina. Come and sit, Josephina. I-I think it's letting up. Yes, I think it might blow over. [JORGE SPEAKS IN BASQUE] Sì, Papa. I'm sure it's gonna blow over. And then Maggie will not have to spend the night. Right, Mama? If the rain stop, maybe she go home. Well, the news says there's storms all over the Pacific, all the way from here to Timbuktu. Timbuktu is in Africa. That's the opposite direction. I mean, how can anyone be such an ignoramus? From here to China then. And don't be so smart. IRENE: Yeah, yeah. Since when is the weatherman right, anyway? ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]: Now the nightly war news... Dickie-- Don't you think it might be better to take Dickie home instead of spending the night? [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] Ed, turn off the radio. Why? What was he saying? I'll do it. ED: I wanted to hear the war news. MAGGIE: Shut up, Ed. IRENE: It would be difficult with Dickie. I think the rain's gonna let up. JORGE [IN ENGLISH]: I think it's better to stay. The roads are dangerous. We have plenty of room. It's better they stay. That's what they say, it's better they stay. MAGGIE: Well, I guess it's settled. We stay. I wish I could get fresh lamb like this. Next time you go to the ranch, could you get us some? Our coupons go so-- Boy, I'm pooped! I am so sleepy. May I be excused, Ita? Mm. [DISHES CLATTER] Are you finished? [DICKIE CRYING] Oh, come on. Oh! Better get the sheets on the bed and get you to sleep. Come on. Ita. Ah... [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] [CHUCKLES] Come on, angel. Well, sir, uh... how are things at the ranch? Everything is fine now. Oh, well, great. Great. How's Martin? He's not at the ranch anymore now, is he? Didn't he join the Army or...? Martin? Yeah, Martin. How is he? Maggie told me that he's-- I am very tired. It is late. Excuse me, please. [♪♪♪] [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] Someone just pulled up! Betcha that's him! God, no, it's too early. Oh, why did Margaret have to come tonight? I know. She's such a blab. But she won't find out anything. She's too dumb. [LAUGHS] Okay, all right. Birth certificate, driver's license, money, gas coupons. Okay, check the stairs. JORGE: Josephina! I forget Papa's milk. I'll do it. No. It has to be me. JORGE: Josephina! Dickie isn't the only baby who wants his milk. I'll put it on. Your father hates me. He does not. Just stop harping on that. Just don't mention Martin. Everything'll be fine. Go tell him I'll be just a few minutes. Roger. I thought I'd give you a hand. Thanks. Why do you have on your high heels? I just haven't taken them off yet, that's all. Good night. Good night. Need some help, soldier? I was at the corner at my call box, saw you here. Hell of a night to have car trouble. Uh, no, it's no car trouble. Uh... I just sort of lost my way here trying to find Highway 80, but I think I've got it now. Just follow me. No, I'm sure I've got it now. No bother. Anything for a man in uniform. [WHISPERING PRAYERS] [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] [♪♪♪] [LAUGHS] [HORSE WHINNIES] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [WHISPERS IN BASQUE] [THUNDER RUMBLING IN DISTANCE] IRENE: It wasn't him. He pulled away. What's going on in here? Oh, God! Margaret. What's going on in here? Don't tell her anything! MAGGIE: What do you mean? Stop it, both of you. Maggie, listen, I have to tell you something. I'm going away tonight. Maggie. Maggie, I'm getting married. Jack and I, we're getting married. You and Jack? You can't. Yes, she can. If you open your big mouth, I'll kill you! Thank you, heh. I'll be sending a telegram from the Carlsbad Hotel sometime tomorrow morning. You'll still be here when it comes. I'm counting on you to help make Papa understand. He's gonna hit the ceiling. He's laid down the law about you and Jack. You know what he's like. He blows up like a bomb, and then it's all over. If you're not killed when the bomb goes off, everything's okay. I know. I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt Papa. If only there were more time, but there is no more time. They're sending Jack overseas to fight. I'm sure once Papa gets to know Jack better, he'll come around. I'm sure it'll all be all right. Jack is like that. He has a way of making everything all right. I see a car! [♪♪♪] I'm so sorry, darling. A cop came along, and I had to-- It doesn't matter. Nothing matters as long as we're together. I just didn't want you to worry. I wasn't worried. I knew you'd be here. The whole U.S. Army and all its allies couldn't have kept me away. [BOTH LAUGHING] [THUNDER CRASHES] Check in later. What the hell's going on? You've been gone for over a half an hour. I can't tell you. Okay, fine. Ahem, let's go to sleep. Besides, even if I did tell you, you wouldn't believe it. All right, I wouldn't believe it. [SCOFFS] Well, I'm not gonna tell you. For crying out loud, will you tell me? That'll be a lot quicker than not telling me. Josie has eloped. What? She's run off with that soldier. You remember, the one that she wanted to marry a while back. I don't believe it. I told you you wouldn't believe it. Fine on the oil and water. Okay, thanks. I guess you weren't lost after all, were you? Heh, not exactly, no. Could I see your driver's license, please? Yeah. Could I see some ID on the lady? Well, just a minute. You don't need to see her license. She's not driving. Look, I'm sorry I said I was lost back there, but I-- It's all right, Jack. I don't mind. We haven't done anything wrong. No? Then why are you both looking so guilty? I don't know what you two kids are up to, but I'd think twice about it if I were you. It's not what you think. It's none of your business. The roads north of here can get dangerous in weather like this. Look, why don't you act like nice, smart kids and go home where you belong? Thanks for the advice. [ENGINE STARTS] [BELL DINGS] Is it really too dangerous up ahead? No. No, he just said that to scare us. No. Don't worry. Everything's fine. [RINGING] Hello? What? The police? Yes, they are, but you can talk to me. Give to me. Give to me, Irene. Yes, yes, this is Mrs. Larraneta. But that's impossible. She's here-- Where is Josephina? [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Please, don't tell Papa. What happened? Where'd she go? [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] For crying out loud, leave her alone! Father Larraneta, Josie's eloped. You told! How could you? What does this mean? What's the point in hiding it? It's over. She's been found out. What is this? Papa... Josie has gone away to get married. You traitor! Is it that soldier? Is she with the soldier? Where did they go? [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] Carlsbad Hotel. [♪♪♪] What God has joined together this night, let no man put asunder. Jack? [RINGING] Please, don't go. [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] Things are different here. [SPEAKING IN BASQUE] [GIGGLES] [SIGHS] Well... This is a great room. Isn't this a great room? What the heck is this? Look at all this rice. I thought that suitcase was heavy. You know, Josie, sweetheart, it's not so important that we clean this up right now, is it? Everyone'll know. Everyone will know that we're newlyweds. Well, yeah. I guess they will. I guess it doesn't matter, really. I feel sort of silly. You don't look silly. You look beautiful. Oh, Jack. It's just that I'm sort of... I mean, I've never-- I mean, I don't have a lot of experience about things. I've never even stayed in a hotel room before. But you're a man, and I suppose that you have more experience with this sort of thing. Don't you? Oh, yeah, sure. Don't worry. [SIGHS] Well... to tell you the truth, Jo... I really haven't had all that much experience. In fact, I haven't stayed in a hotel room either. [BOTH CHUCKLE] But I figured even if I wasn't Gary Cooper or Clark Gable, you'd understand. Because you know I love you. [CHIMING] Do you remember when we rode the ferry to Coronado? It was such a pretty night. I asked you about your family. And I told you I didn't have a family. But I have a family now. You're my family. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Yes? Bellboy. I'm sorry, sir. There's a man downstairs. He says he has to talk to your wife. I'm awfully sorry, but he's very insistent. Thank you. I'll go down and take care of this. Jack, I have to go alone. Jack, please. Believe me. It's the only way. [♪♪♪] Papa. I'm sorry you came here. What did your mother and I do to deserve this? What kind of a daughter did God give us who would be so cruel to her family? No, Papa, it isn't like that. Then come home with me. Now. No. I can't do that. Josephina, your sister could be this foolish, but not you. Running away at night with the soldier, disobeying your father. And what is he? Nothing. He's the man I love. He has nothing and he's nothing! He is my husband. Your husband? What do the commandments say? It is your father who come first in everything! No. Papa, I'll always love you, but now it is my husband who comes first. Papa, please... try to understand. There's a war. A war? I see many wars. Only the family's important, and you have betrayed your family! No. I haven't betrayed you. You have betrayed me. You have turned against me like your brother, Martin. No. I'm not like Martin. I've always loved you better than anyone. I've always done everything for you. I never thought that you'd do such a thing to me. Papa, please. Please, if only you'll give us a chance, I'm-- I'm sure you'll... You'll understand. And when you understand, you will forgive us. No! I will never forgive you. If you don't come home with me now, I will never see you again. No. No, don't-- Don't say that. You don't mean it. I do mean it! [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] I will go back with you. But I'm not leaving my husband. I'll try and make you understand. But even if you don't understand, you can't keep me forever. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] A message for you, sir. [♪♪♪] Okay. [SPEAKS IN BASQUE] [THUNDER CRASHES] [TIRES SCREECH] Papa! Papa! [SCREAMING] Hello, my name is Martin Lawrence. My father and sister are here. They were just brought in. Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Lawrence. There is no one by that name. Excuse me. My father's name is Larraneta. Jorge Larraneta. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Dios mío. [WHISPERS] Mama. If only George were still alive, none of this could happen. Mama, don't. Mama. It is so good you're here. I came right away, Mama. What happened? What happened? Josie eloped with Jack McKenna. You know, the man that she wanted to marry. No, I don't know. Well, anyway, they wanted to get married. Papa wouldn't let them, so they ran away together tonight. Papa found out and went after them. He was bringing Josie home, and apparently... Jack was following them. There was an accident, and Papa's car went into the lagoon. Where is he? Where's Papa? I wanna see him. He's dead. He drowned. [♪♪♪] Don't leave me, Papa. Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Papa. Papa! Papa, come back! Please, don't leave me, Papa. Don't leave me! Please come back, Papa! I'll never be bad again, I promise! Never! Never! Papa, come back! Don't leave me! Papa! Papa, don't leave me! [WHISPERS] Please, don't leave me. Mr. McKenna? I'm sorry, the family won't talk to you. I can't force them. No. There's nothing you can do here. Josephine can't have any visitors. Is she all right? She'll be fine. The best thing would be for you to go and get some sleep now. Do me a favor? Tell her I love her. What are you doing here, Martin? Leave me alone, Maggie. I didn't think I'd see you so upset. You don't understand anything about what Papa meant to me. You'll never understand. This isn't over. Don't be ridiculous. It was an accident. But was it? Josie ran off against Papa's wishes. And that soldier, he was chasing them later. Was that an accident? If it wasn't for him, Papa would still be alive. Well, there's nothing you can do about it. You're wrong. I'm going to get revenge. You're not gonna do a damn thing. Don't underestimate me, Maggie. I'm not. I just know what you're like. You don't understand anything. No one understands. But I'm going to be what Papa wanted me to be. I'm going to do what he would have done. And he would never have let a thing like this go unpunished. [KEYS JINGLE] [♪♪♪] He's dead. Papa's dead. That's not true. It can't be. You could always do anything and he would forgive you. Because he loved you so much. But he can never forgive you now... Josie. He's dead. I've lost him. He'll never forgive me now. [SOFTLY] Oh, God. What can I do? [♪♪♪] I, Jorge Larraneta, do make this my last will and testament. I am Basque by heritage. I came to this country with nothing, and what I have, I have earned by the work I have done with my hands. I now leave this to those I love most in the world... my family. LAWYER: "I bequeath my cattle and sheep ranch, my properties in downtown San Diego, and the remainder of my estate, except my house on Texas Street, to my loving wife Sebastiana. I bequeath my house to my beloved daughter, Josephine. It is my wish that Josephine live in this house and care for her mother. I wish to name Josephine executrix to my estate so that she can manage it for her mother with full power of attorney. It is my wish to be buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in the plot next to that of my loving son, George. To my other son, Martin, I bequeath $10. It is my will that he be cut out of all family business and monies. Throughout his life, whenever I trusted him, he cheated me. He mismanaged the ranch when control of it fell to him because of my illness, and then he tried to sell it while I was still helpless. My ranch is the achievement of my life, and I will never forgive him for what he tried to do. My daughter, Margaret, I leave in the care of her husband, as I know he will always care well for her. I leave the welfare of my youngest daughter, Irene, in the hands of her mother and her sister Josephine. I consign my soul to the merciful judgment of the lord my God, knowing that I've always tried to be honest and just in my actions on earth. With my hand I seal this, my last will and testament, written on the 31st of March, 1940." Excuse me, please. I think perhaps you'd like to be alone. Thank you very much, Mr. Brown. We appreciate it. Pobre Martin. He never could please your father. Never. Your father never loved Martin. He always loved George. He never loved Martin. What can we tell him now when he finds out about this? We won't tell him. What? We won't tell Martin what was in the will. He doesn't have to know. Maybe we can find a way to give Martin some peace. Meat tokens? Martin, how on earth do you do it? All right, what is it this time? What's the big favor? It's a little favor. It's just I've got a buddy, and I need to know where he's being shipped out to. It's that simple. His name is Jack McKenna. Private Jack McKenna. I could try to find out. I don't suppose there's any harm in that. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] [♪♪♪] Josie! Jack! Oh! Oh, I wasn't sure you'd be here. Margaret kept saying you wouldn't talk to me. Didn't know if Irene would give you the message. She told me right away. Jack... Oh, I love you, Josie. I love you. Josie... I am so sorry about your father. I did my best-- Oh, I know. Oh, Jack, what are we gonna do? I feel... I feel like it's all because of us. No. It wasn't our fault. It was an accident. Josie... Josie, I love you. I won't let anything, anything take you away from me. Take this with you. It's a part of me now. Okay, with me. And when I come home... we'll go into the church where we got married and we'll stand in front of the same altar... Yes. ...and I'll put this ring right back on your finger. Yes. We'll start over, Jo. We'll walk up to that church and we'll begin our new life together. My father died recently in a car accident. He came to America as a young man... and he made something of himself. Now he's gone, and this country that he loved so much is involved in a life-and-death struggle, and so I just feel I've got to go and fight. Someone has to put their life on the line. I want to put my life on the line. I respect your feelings, Corporal Lawrence. Mm, La-- Lara-- Larranet-- Larraneta, sir. It's my real name. It is kind of hard to pronounce. I Americanized it. Well, it's a mouthful, all right. Now, let's see. it says here you wanna be transferred to the 34th Division in Italy. You know that division has one of the highest casualty rates in the war? Yes, sir. I know, sir. I'll be honest with you, corporal, we don't get requests like this very often. My father and I were very close, sir. I was always his favorite son. He knew he could depend on me to do the right thing. I feel as if he's encouraging me now, sir. I know this is the right thing for me to do. To serve my country and honor the memory of my father... sir, I must go and fight. You're a good man, corporal. I can't guarantee anything, but I'll support your transfer request and we'll see what we can do for you. Thank you, sir. [♪♪♪] Listen up. We'll be heading northwest, cover about two and a half miles, silent march. Our last report show the enemy in a couple of farms on the other side of the ridge. Now, we're looking for information. If possible, we're looking to take prisoners. You can turn over your personal effects now. If you don't come back, they'll be returned to your family. Rosenberg's men. All right, go. McKenna and Lawrence, take the stable. Young and I will take the main house. All right, let's go. [♪♪♪] Corporal, you there? [EXPLOSIONS] [MEN SCREAMING] [EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE] SOLDIER 1: Rosenberg! Where are you? [RAPID GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE] SOLDIER 2: Get down, get down! Get out! [INCOMING MISSILES DRONING] [♪♪♪] Well, Corporal Lawrence, you look better. Let me help you sit up now. Come on. Because they're coming for you. Coming for me? Who? I mean, why are they coming for me? It's because you killed that soldier. In the farmhouse. You remember. But I didn't mean it. I-- I didn't do it on purpose. Don't they know that? It wasn't my fault. It-- It just happened. Really. I don't think they believe that. Ten-hut! [♪♪♪] Gentlemen, for extraordinary bravery under fire, above and beyond the call of duty, in the service of your country and for the particular devotion you each showed to your comrades in arms by risking your own lives to save the other, I hereby award the Bronze Star to you, Private Jack McKenna. Congratulations. And to you, Corporal Martin Lawrence. Congratulations. You have the gratitude and the respect of your government and of your fellow soldiers. [ALL APPLAUDING, CHEERING] [SHUTTER CLICKS] So why don't you tell me in your own words what it was like? Uh... Well, it, uh, was like it always is. Um... Cold, wet, muddy. Stiff with Germans trying to kill us. You know, normal. [CHUCKLES] SOLDIER: Yeah! Yes. But, uh, what did you do? Well, first he saved me, and then I saved him. I guess if we were Chinese, we'd own each other. [ALL CHUCKLE] So how does it feel to be a hero? It feels good. [CHUCKLING] Yeah, it feels good. [JACK SIGHS] [CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Lawrence. I got a cigarette if you've got a light. How you mending? I'm fine, just fine. How about you? All too well. Pretty soon, I'll be able to throw back to the front. Doesn't seem fair, does it? We should stick together, you and I. We're lucky together, aren't we? I guess we are. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's a deal then, okay? You and me... we're gonna live through this war. [♪♪♪] I've got a girl back home. She's so sweet. I wish you could see her, Corporal. I wanna get back to San Diego bad. Is that where you're from? Yeah. I've heard it's nice there. Good weather, that's what they say. Yeah, oh, the best. Where are you from? Chicago. Terrible weather but I wish I was there. You got a first name, Corporal? Mine's Jack. Yeah, sure. My name is Martin. But everybody just called me Marty. Okay, Marty. You and me, we're gonna make it home. You bet. We're gonna make it. [♪♪♪] [MACHINE GUNS FIRING FROM AIRPLAINE] Go! Go! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [SCREAMS] [ALL CHEERING INDISTINCTLY] [CAR HORN HONKS] [CROWD CHANTING IN ITALIAN] [SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] The war is over. Is this true what Mama's telling me? Is it? Well, Mama and I talked it over, and we both feel the same way. MAGGIE: What about Papa's will? You can't give Martin the ranch. It's completely against what Papa wanted. It's true about the will, but I-- Margaret, do you wanna tell Martin that he's disinherited? I don't think I have to tell Martin anything. I'm not the executor of the will, now, am I? Well, I'm not going to tell him. Not after what he's been through. What has he been through? He didn't even tell us he was leaving. He's never written. We don't even know where he is. Why should he write? Nobody in this family has ever given a damn about him. Martin has his reasons for what he's doing. I think he wants to prove himself to all of us. Well, I'm sure you've got it all figured out. We all know what Martin is like. We know what happened the last time he ran the ranch. Can't you see? The war is over. Things will be different. Martin will take good care of the ranch. Martin has changed. Martin will never change. The minute he gets his hands on that ranch, he is going to sell it. And if you can't see that, you're blind. And what's going to happen to us without the ranch? [SCOFFS] Margaret, you're acting as if the ranch were the only thing in the world we ever had. You really are the most selfish person I have ever known. You're awfully critical of other people, aren't you? Well, I'll tell you who should have been disinherited. You, that's who. Margarita! Well, it's true. So why not say it? Everybody knows it. If it weren't for you and Jack, Papa would still be alive! And if you have any notions of getting back with Jack when he comes home, you better just forget it, because nobody in this family will stand for it. MAMA: Stop it, Margarita. Just stop it. Josephina will never do such a thing. It's all over for them long ago. No letters. Nothing. You shouldn't think things like that about your sister. [BLEATES] SOLDIER: See if he can get us now. Hey, fellas. You two assholes make a real ominous pair of guards. They needed their best men right here. Today, a dog tried to pee in this here fountain. But we got the situation under control. Cup of joe. [SIGHS] Full house. Damn right. Holy shit! Hey, guys! SOLDIERS: Ohhh! Madoon. How does he do it? Sugar. Eggs. Jelly. Don't ask. It's better not to know. Just keep them coming on out. On out! Hey, guys, get your tiger sweat out. We are going the fuck home! It's a goddamn list, you guys, and we're on it. All right, here, listen up. Shipping out to Leghorn on July 10th, Dogface Bernotsky. Yes! July 23, Marty Lawrence. July 31, yours truly, and Paul Nelson. August 10th, Jack McKenna, Barney Mesner, and Joseph Long! [ALL CHEERING] Home! Home! Yeah! SOLDIER: We're going home! Marty! We're going home. We made it. Right. Yeah, we made it. We're lucky together. We're lucky together. We're lucky together! Right up to the end. Right up to the end. Come on, Marty, shake a leg. No, you go ahead. I don't think I'll go. Hey, this is gonna be great. We could go to the movies. We can get drunk. Shit, Marty, we're going home. We're gonna rip this town up tonight. Aren't you happy we're going home, Marty? Sure. Sure, of course I am. I don't know. I just sort of got to thinking about things. Everything is gonna be so different all of a sudden. You and me. We can't be friends anymore. Of course, we can, Marty. You and me, we'll always be friends. Right. Now, come on, we're gonna be late. I'll join you later, okay? Okay. Just follow the noise! [WHISTLING A TUNE] [WHISTLING TUNE] [♪♪♪] We'll always be friends. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] We beat it. You and me, pal. [BELL TOLLS] What's your name? [CHUCKLES] Isn't she pretty, sergeant? Yeah, she's gorgeous. I'm a married man. And your wife's 6000 miles away. No. No. She's right here. Gentlemen, to the good old U.S. of A! SOLDIERS: U.S. of A! Marty, we made it. We're lucky together, right up to the end. You and me. All right, a real sweetheart. What did you do wrong? I don't know. I'm gonna get Marty. Take him to the airport. Right. All right? We'll always be friends. We made it, you and me, pal. You and me. We're lucky together. George, is that you? What are you doing? I have to tell you something. I didn't tell you the truth before. And you don't know who I am. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, George. Marty, listen to me. I'm Jack. Remember? Your friend Jack? I'm sorry, Jack. I'm real sorry. George... was my younger brother. He died a few years ago of tuberculosis. I guess you sort of remind me of him. [♪♪♪] That must have been rough, losing him. Everybody loved him so much. I loved him. He was everything I wanted to be. Sure. I understand. Do you? I don't think you understand. That's what I've been trying to tell you. You are my brother now. I do understand, Marty. I really do. After all we've been through together. This crazy war. No. No! No, just listen to me for a minute. You are my brother. You really are. I lied to you about who I was. My name isn't really Lawrence, and I'm not from Chicago. I don't care where you're from, Marty. I'm from San Diego, just like you! My name is Larraneta. Martin Larraneta. You married my sister Josie. Man, you got him! Keep going. Faster, come on. Yeah! All right! Okay, you bums, pay up. Who's next? Bernotsky, I'll put money on you. No. Hey, where's McKenna anyway? He fall in the toilet? I found you, and I got transferred into this unit. I've been following you, Jack. No. I'm not letting you go. I followed you here. I'm not letting you go now. Look, I don't care who you are or how the hell you got-- I'm your brother, goddamn it! Aren't you listening to me? You don't believe me, do you? My name is Martin Larraneta. I come from San Diego. My house is at 3984 Texas Street. I have an older sister named Margaret and a teenaged sister named Irene. My mother's name is Sebastiana. And my father's name is Jorge! Do you know that name? Jorge. Do you remember him? Do you remember him? What happened to your father was an accident. I tried to save him. You must believe that. I know who you are. I know what you've done. And I'm not going to rest until you've paid for it. Do you remember that night in the farmhouse? I didn't mean to save you that night, Jack. I meant to kill you! Come on, fellas. Got a little café party starter in the café across the road. Hey, you two guys okay? I think we're okay. Well? Let's go celebrate. We're going home! We're going home! Yeah! Home! ALL: ♪ Home, home on the range Where the deer-- ♪ Don't you ever go home! I said, don't ever go back!

You and Josie can never be together! I won't let you! The minute I get out of here, I'm going back to Josie. Nothing in this world can come between us. Your father couldn't keep us apart, and you won't keep us apart. Hey, hey! Marty! Marty, what the hell has gotten into you? Listen, the last thing that I need is trouble with the M.P.'s here! I'm going home in a couple of weeks. I'm not gonna have a couple of hot heads fuck it up for me! You okay, Jack? I'm fine. You just cool off, Marty. You mess with Jack again, we'll mess you up. Come on. Hey, where's Bernotsky? He's puking in the can. [LAUGHS] He's so drunk he couldn't find his fuck with both hands. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [OPERA PLAYING OVER RADIO] MAN: Gosh. MAN: Ohio. WOMAN: Ohio. [WOMAN LAUGHING] All right, just a minute now. One more, one more. [SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] Oh, come on. Wait, wait. Just one more. We're all real proud of you, Martin. You did a hell of a job over there. It was a job that needed doing. I just did my best, that's all. Martin, what did you get the Bronze Star for? I got it for saving another soldier's life when we were under fire during a night patrol. How about that? A real hero in the family. [SCOFFS] Why do you have that thing on your head? You look ridiculous. I look ridiculous? I look ridiculous? Well, at least I have a good reason. What's that supposed to mean? Stop flapping your gums and help me with this stuff. [INSTRUMENTAL POP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] [MEN SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] Eppie, have you seen Martin? Martin? No. Martin doesn't play rummy. Take the boot-a. You squeeze all the air out of it, point it up at the-- [LAUGHING] Gabby, is Martin out here? No. Nobody out here but us chickens. What do you--? Martin? Martin? Martin. What are you doing here? It's just all those people, Jo. I mean, I know they mean well, but I... I needed a minute by myself. I know. I'm sorry I bothered you. It's okay, Jo. Don't go. I mean, you're not like the others. I don't mind being with you. Well... Maybe this is the right time. I have something very important that I wanna give to you, Martin. [GIGGLES] It's yours, Martin. The ranch is yours now. Papa wanted you to have it. [BOTH SIGH] Do you understand, Martin? Papa forgave you in the end. You don't have to torture yourself about him anymore. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. I can't handle it, Jo. Oh, you can handle it. I know you can, and you'll do just fine. Everything's gonna be all right now. You'll see. It comes from you. What do you mean? Papa would never have done this. It is you who is doing this. No. It comes from Papa. I know you too well, Jo. It comes from you. What difference does it make? Accept it, Martin. If Papa could see you now, he would forgive you. He would forgive you. That's what you really mean. But it's not that easy, Jo. You know it's not that easy. Papa would never have forgiven me. Or you. You're wrong, Martin. The world has changed. And Papa would have changed too. He would have seen things differently. You know it's not that easy. Bonifacio is expecting you. It's all arranged. Everyone is waiting for you. Papa forgave you in the end, Martin. You don't have to torture yourself with him anymore. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [♪♪♪] We didn't think this particular piece of property would be coming on the market. It's a real pleasure. I'm glad it's going into good hands. Nothing to worry about. I can assure you that escrow will close right on time. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Martin. Well, do you need me for anything else? No. Goodnight, Bonie. But, Martin, how can you sell this ranch? Don't you think this is hard for me, Bonifacio? I was practically raised here. But things are different in our family now, Bonie. And we talked it over, all together, Mama, Jo and me. Of course, we'd love to keep the place forever. But we just can't ranch this land anymore, you and me and the family. We'll remember what it was like here. Goodnight, Martin. [CLATTERS LOUDLY] Here, let me get that for you. I'm sorry. Don't worry. We always lose a couple of glasses on that curve. On your way home, huh? Yeah, I'm going home. Oh, that's good. You know, I love to see soldiers going home. I love to see them getting off the train. There'll be somebody waiting for you at the station? Oh, yeah, someone will be there. Someone pretty wonderful. That's great. Where you getting off? San Diego. Almost there. We'll be in tomorrow. I've been waiting for tomorrow for a long, long time. How do I look? Do I have everything? You look swell, Jo. You've got everything. Anyway, I'm sure that wherever you go, you could get a toothbrush. I got it. You didn't forget it because I packed it. Say, where are you going? You can tell me. The first place we're going is the church at San Luis Rey. Where we were married. [ENGINE REVVING] [TRAIN HORN TOOTS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Jack! Jack! Jack! Here I am. [♪♪♪] Oh! I can't believe I'm here with you. I dreamed about this. I can't believe it either. It's all I've thought about for a year and a half. Did you do everything the way we planned? Everything. Irene has it all under control. Nobody knows a thing. And in a few days, I'll just make a phone call. Great. There are so many things I need to talk to you about. But for now, everything can wait. Right? For now, let's forget about the war. Forget about your family. I've got a lot of Army pay here, Jo. Let's go have a honeymoon. [CAR HORN TOOTS] [HONKS HORN] The war changed everything. It's not a small town anymore. You haven't changed. [GIGGLES] Hey, where are you going, you idiot? Oh, that's great! What the hell are you trying to do, kill us both? I said, where's Josie? MAGGIE: What has gotten into you? Will you leave her alone? I told you. Josie has gone to visit the Egsineeds for a few days. Don't be ridiculous, Maggie. You don't believe that, do you? Why shouldn't I? She's with Jack McKenna. Don't you see? She's run off with Jack McKenna! Come on, she wouldn't do that. If Margaret says she's-- She has done it! I know that she has. She did it before, and now she's done it again. And I'm sure Irene knows about it just like before. You know, I have thought about this so many times during the war. Going back to the church with you. I'm not her guardian angel! I don't know any more about where she is than you do! You're lying! Today is the 22nd! Jack returned today! They're together! Where'd they go? Come on, Martin. Shut up, Maggie! Just let off on her! Shut up, Maggie! Irene, you're gonna tell me, or you're gonna be sorry. I don't know! And even if I did know, I would never tell you! Never! Never! Never! You little bitch! MAMA: Martin! So you have come here. It's all right. It's all right. He won't hurt you anymore. Margarita, take care of your sister. All of you. I will talk to Martin alone. Mama. You've got to understand. I need to know where Josie is. What you did upsetted your father's soul. Bonifacio telephoned to me today. He said he doesn't want to work for anyone else. He want to stay with our family. He thought we knew. He thought the whole family decided together to sell the ranch. He say you told him that! We trusted you, and you betrayed us. How could you do this to your family? It was my decision to make, Mama! I'm the head of the family now. You are the head of nothing! Your father was right about you. I didn't want to believe him. I believed your lies. But now I know that he was right. Leave this house, Martin. You are not welcomed here anymore. [♪♪♪] Everything's okay under the hood. Okay. [WHISTLES A TUNE] My dearest Josie, I sit and look at your wedding ring, and I can see you. It's the only thing that keeps me going sometimes. I believe I'll get home, Jo, dearest Jo. And when I do, I'll take you back to the old church in San Luis Rey just like I promised. MAGGIE: Martin? Martin? Are you listening? Martin. [HONKS HORN] Hey, get out of the way, quick! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] Let's go home, Josie. [GRUNTS] Martin! Run, Josie, run! Run! [GRUNTS] [CREAKING] [BELL TOLLING] [♪♪♪] [GROANS] I have to go up! I have to get Jack! That's impossible. You can't get through. We have to get help. Jack! [GROANING] Jack! Jack, Jack. Help me, please. Jack. Save me. Save me! Jack, don't let me die! Hang on, Marty. No! [SCREAMS] [TOLLING CHAOTICALLY] [♪♪♪] [BELL RINGING SOFTLY] [PRIEST SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ALL: Amen. MAN: Buongiorno! CROWD: Buongiorno! [ALL CONTINUE IN ITALIAN] JOSIE: Mama? Mama? Josephina. I'm here, Mama. I was dreaming. I was dreaming about my home. This is your home. My home. That's why we did come here. We thought that, here, all of our problems would end. We thought that, here, all of our dreams becomes true. But there has only been pain for our family here. I want you to see someone. This is my husband. Please. Accept us. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
