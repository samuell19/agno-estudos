MUSIC: Life In Pink by Kate Nash # I think about death all the time # Do you think that's morbid # I'm not like the other girls # Don't get me started # But I'm # Trying # Well, I wish that I could take you to another time # When everything was cool and my mental health was fine # But I'm # Trying # I'm not lying # When you're in my head # Well, I wish it was someone else # Mad at me again # And that's not even what I said # What's wrong with me? # Am I a person yet? # What's wrong with me? # Oh! # Wish I could let my brain # Decide and stop the pain # I keep heart-shaped glasses close to me # For when it rains Life in pink # Rip it up and start again # But I'm loving you the same # I keep heart-shaped glasses close to me # For when it rains Life in pink # Life in pink # Life in pink... # Oh, good, great. Dressing room's upstairs. OK, I'm kicking you out, I've got to get ready in here. I'm steaming my vocals before we go on cos it helps with my throat cos I get problems on the road, and I just put these vapours in. It's lavender, eucalyptus, menthol, pinus. P-I-N-U-S, not P-E-N-I-S! A bunch of shit, basically, to clean my tubes, and help with my... - You know, people are like, yeah, touring, yeah, it's so glamorous and all the rest of it. But you know, when you're living in here, it does make it fairly tough from time to time, and people get sick, and that's the main thing. - You can't be a wimp to do what we do. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Oh, are we live-streaming? - Right here. - In three, two, one. - Can you talk a little bit about your experience as, like, a female artist in the music industry, and what that's like? - How long do you have? I'm not going to, like, sweeten it for anyone. It really sucks. But music is, like, not a choice for me. How are you? - I'm great, how are you? A bit starstruck. - I'm always going to want to connect with people. I love playing live. Like, I'm going to fucking want to find a way to do it. But sometimes, I don't really know if I can do this. Like, I don't want to fucking do music any more because it's like, it's just too hard to keep battling all these wankers all the time. This is a matter of life and death to me, because making music, like, keeps me alive, and being in the music industry almost has killed me a bunch of times. - You're doing the leather coat and everything? - Yeah. OK. - You did the tattoo already, right? - Yes. - OK. - I did. Hi, guys. CHEERING WHISTLING MUSIC: Foundations by Kate Nash # Thursday night # Everything's fine # Except that you've got that look in your eye # When I'm telling a story # You find it boring # You're thinking of something to say... # I can't tell you how many times I've played Foundations cos I've played it so many fucking times. # ..Then you'll call me a bitch # And everyone we're with # Will be embarrassed # And I won't give a shit... # That song is weird because I have such an interesting relationship with it. It, like, changed my life. It literally changed my life, that song. # ..My fingertips are holding on to # The cracks in our foundation # And I know that I should let go... # That was my biggest hit, you know. It's amazing playing that song live because everybody sings it. # ..And every time we fight I know it's not right # Every time that you're upset and I smile # I know I should forget but I can't... # I was always, like, labelled a silly little teenage girl who was writing in her diary. There's nothing silly about being a teenage girl, that's actually one of the most deep things in the world. That was what my fans really loved, that's why I had a number one record. When I look back on my career now, I'm like, God, I was just not ready for what happened to me. - Her album Made Of Bricks, number one in the British charts this August, please welcome Kate Nash, everybody, Kate Nash! - So, your single Foundations has been at number two, it seems like for ages. It was held off the number one spot first by Rihanna, and her bloody Umbrella, and now by Timberland. How frustrating is it? - I've kind of been finding it quite funny cos I didn't even expect to be in the top ten. During Made Of Bricks, I was like so young, and my life drastically changed. It was a really crazy thing to go through. People are like chasing me to a taxi. And I was like, "I'm not Beyonce!" - This is the whole side of fame you're going to have to get used to now. - I feel like now I'd be much more equipped to handle that, but, like, when you're young and you're inexperienced, you just have to, like, keep, keep, keep working... - And the winner is... My daughter Peggy will be very pleased, it's Kate Nash! - I want to say heads-up to all the women, as well, in this category who are helping to eradicate the misconception that female is a genre, cos it isn't. Thank you! It wasn't like I was trying to be a pop star. I just wanted to make songs. # The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay # The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay. # I mean, I guess I actually started playing melodies on the piano, making up melodies when I was a really little kid, and that's why I ended up getting piano lessons at seven years old. I was just always attracted to music. I grew up studying theatre and, like, wanting to make theatre shows, and wanting to make interactive art, and music became the most accessible way of doing that. When I finished school, I was working in Nando's and just being like in a fast-food restaurant in a dead-end job. One day, I fell downstairs and broke my foot. I was bored, and I was forced to be at home, and I had nothing else to do, like, literally, my future prospects were the chip fryer and serving people at Nando's. So that's when Mum and Dad bought me my first electric guitar. So I spent those six weeks just writing songs, uploading, creating a MySpace page, making demos, and researching into how to make it as a musician, basically. I don't think I would have done it if I hadn't broken my foot. - Welcome along, this is X-Posure on X FM, I'm John Kennedy, and I'm very pleased to say that Kate is here. - Hi. John, do you know what? You were always, like, my first play, as well, you played my first-ever radio ever, you have a letter from me still, don't you? - I have a hand-typed letter, not even done on a PC. - "I've got 700 friends on MySpace. "Please play my music." - I first learned about Kate through a letter and a CD, and I started playing that on the radio. It was a big, big favourite on the show. - MUSIC: We Get On by Kate Nash # But asking for your telephone number... # - It was this great little pop song, and it still stands up. - # And I bumped into you... # - There was a great way that Kate was writing at that point, which was really simple and honest and imaginative. There was a lot of imagination in there. She came in to do this radio session, and there was a fantastic response, a really immediate response to it. Loads of people really connected with her songs. Some people were getting in touch saying, I was in tears when I heard that. It's kind of rare for people to connect in that way immediately, just with one play or one performance of a song. Everybody wanted to see Kate. There were queues around the block. - # ..We get on. # - It's also really gratifying to see a massive percentage of the audience were female. And too often, at rock gigs, it's a kind of 70-30 male-female divide, and this was easily the other way. - All of a sudden, the internet just blew everything up. I was right in the window, major record labels, managers, like everyone was using MySpace. - She got signed because she had the most followers on MySpace. Six months later, doing these enormous gigs. - I still lived in, like, my parents' house in, like, my small bedroom that I'd had since I was 15. Everything has been like insanely quick. It kind of, my head gets a bit... I don't know, a bit confused, sometimes. - In the UK, we have a real thirst and hunger for new sensation. The curve can be so quick that you can be discovered and be the next most exciting new thing, and the next morning, almost discarded. - MUSIC: Agenda by Kate Nash # Let it # Let it # Let it... # I mean, I don't know how to explain it more than, like, being bullied by the media, like, how would you feel if you were written about in magazines and called fat and ugly, and your acne was circled in papers? I got called everything. Slut, bitch, fat, ugly, spotty, annoying, chav. Getting hate mail, death threats, rape threats. People saying that they hate you, that you're shit, that they're going to kill you, that they're going to stick a bomb up your cunt and you're going to explode. The older men that I worked with, they didn't look after me or care about me as, like, this 20-year-old girl whatsoever. They just kind of like worked me like a donkey, and I made loads of money for them, sold over a million records and toured the world extensively. It was after I finished touring Made Of Bricks, I honestly didn't know if A, I could ever write another song, and B, if I ever wanted to, cos I was just so tired and sick of it. Sometimes you also need to release the beast within, am I right, Linda? There's another album that was really important to me, and it was all about learning how to be a badass bitch from hell and not taking shit from anyone. My second album Girl Talk, just being like, I don't care what you think, I'm going to have fun. And, like, if I want to make punk rock music, I'm going to. MUSIC: Sister by Kate Nash # There was this cool, cool girl # She was about your age # She kinda had your smile # She kinda had your face... # - Yeah, are you going to do that first? - I think so. - OK. I produced and engineered and mixed Kate's record. She wanted to move away from more of the poppy sound that she'd be known for. Yeah, she definitely started wanting to make a more aggressive, punky, in-your-face girl-power record. - # ..She wanted to be my lover # But my heart was with another and # Yeah, I really wish that we could be friends # But I know that I'll never get you back again... # She was exactly the kind of artist I wanted to work with at that time because she didn't care what anybody said, she just did her thing, and she wasn't listening to other people's opinions. - The only person that she was listening to was herself. - My album was just like all I could think about. I would just do this stuff overnight, you know? Then, I was going to the label and I was like so proud of it and I was like, "This is the best work I've ever done." And they didn't see what this meant and where it could go. So I felt like I was being underestimated by my label. One night, I slept in the back of my car because I was so angry I couldn't drive any more, and I wrote this song called Underestimate The Girl. I just wanted to shake things up. I wanted to piss people off, push buttons and like break the mould of what you're supposed to do as an artist. I dropped it online. The internet just blew up. I was, like, trending. People were like, "Is she on drugs? "This is horrible, this is crazy." Everyone was freaking out cos it was so different to what I'd normally done. I remember NME wrote this article that was like, "Kate Nash just committed career suicide, and it sounds amazing." You've got the opportunity to do something crazy and cool, you have a stage to do weird stuff and freak people out. One of the weirdest texts I've ever gotten in my life was a text message to tell me that I was dropped from my record label. As soon as I'd made something that was creatively different, they just ditched me. It was really shocking. I was not expecting it at all. I think I was just quite naive about not knowing what they wanted, and not really getting that. It's a shame that labels don't allow artists to develop and grow and go through all of the things they need to go through. I was so scared, actually, of sinking as an artist. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to tour in the way that I wanted to tour any more, that I was going to run of money. I was like, "I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do." So I decided to put the record out independently and tour it in a minimal way. I used the money I made from Made Of Bricks to self-fund the whole thing. Then we just were on this crazy crusade throughout that intense crazy period of time that was just like me and my band and my fans, and my touring party, and that's, like, all we had. - Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to say it's been our pleasure serving you this evening, and we hope... - There were certain things that I needed to achieve with Girl Talk to prove to myself, and to the world, I can still do this. If I can get there independently with no support from the media and the industry, then, I can stay afloat as an artist. - I can hear life, that's a good sign! How are you? - I'm nearly ready, I'm not quite ready just yet. - OK, well, we'll see downstairs in a minute, OK? My name is Brett and I am the tour manager for Kate Nash. I've been working with Kate for a few years now. Kate being dropped by her record label without doubt was probably the making of her. It was just a case of Kate was just like, right, I know what I want, I want an all-girl band, I want a young band. Kate was going to play bass to get away from the piano. It does look impressive on the live show when all the girls are rocking out. - Emma doesn't like doing solos. - It's just if I wanted to be a solo wanker, I would have played guitar. - It's not true, man. - It is, and these bitches are like shredders and I'm a groove machine, so, it's different. - Do what you do, though! You don't have to show off. You just have to play what you're comfortable with. - It's rock and roll, bitch! - Yeah, as you know, it just stresses me out. - So, I always like to shout out to all the girls in the audience. Because there are less female musicians than there are boys, so if you're a girl which a lot of you here tonight are, and you're interested in music, then, please don't shy away from it because you feel like, I don't know, you're not good enough, or you're too shy, or you can't do it or some shit. Like, who cares, just do it and it's fun. This song I wrote when Pussy Riot were imprisoned. And this song's called Free My Pussy. And I'm going to be backed up by my girl band, Alicia, Emma and Linda are up here. # Free my pussy # Free my pussy # Free my pussy, let it go # Free my pussy # Free my pussy # Free my pussy, you say no # Meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! # Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow # Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! Oh! That was so good! - Ready? - You're a huge inspiration. - You're so great. - We just started a girl band and definitely our first... - Did you?! Oh, my God, that's so cool. - Our first song that we wrote together is most definitely inspired by you. - I tour because I love it. Touring is also when my work becomes tangible. - You're amazing, keep it up for ever. - OK, I promise. - The biggest thing with Girl Talk was, cos Kate had been dropped from her label, it was to try and still have a show with big impact and a big sound on a fraction of the budget. Even though we'd kept the costs really, really down, still, it's not cheap, you know? We're playing 200- and 300-capacity venues, where there's no physical way you can make enough money from those shows to even cover the expenses. When you've got a label, it's great, you know, they fund it. But when it's coming out of your own pocket, you know, you can soon get quite nervous when you've lost you know, tens of thousands of pounds, let's say, with no guarantee that money's going to come back. - Luckily, I found Gary, so I have this wonderful new manager. - Are you coming? When I met Kate, she was kind of going through this bad point of getting dropped and putting out a record on her own. I told her, as long as she was patient and we could make some changes over the next three to four months, hopefully we could turn things around. And we really did. You know I got you covered, Nash. - Yes. - She had a good 18 months of touring. - DJ SPEAKS IN MANDARIN - ..the Big Drive Home, we never stop the beat. Please welcome Kate Nash to our studio, woo! - Xie xie. - Your first time in China. - Yes, yeah. First-ever time, I can't believe like we're playing the show tomorrow in that amazing Bird's Nest, it's really exciting to be here. OK, yeah. Can we just do that again, just check it a bit more. - Can we sound check and finish? Alicia's freezing, seriously. - A lot of people lose belief in you when you get dropped from a record label. I was so relieved, because I had all these doors shut, that someone was like passionate and excited to come and be there for me. Gary was that like pit bull, he was a fighter, he's aggressive, he went for it. - Those apples! - But they're like so sweet. - It's really good, we need to bring these to LA. - Yeah. - And London. - And start a business. - Yeah. If this whole music thing doesn't work out, we've got an apple shop. - OK. And me and Gary kind of scrambled like maniacs to keep me afloat as an artist and successfully tour the record and put it out. - Here we are in the hotel in Beijing. Kate and the girls are rehearsing right now in the room for the show. - KATE PLAYS GUITAR # ..I've been saving all this stuff inside of me for you # But you ain't giving me the best # You were cool - Cool - # I even said that # You were cool - # Cool - # You were cool # You were cool # Ah, ah, ah-ah # Oh, oh, oooooh - Ooooooh... - # THEY LAUGH OK. - Is there anything here we can take? - So, Kate's manager now is, er, he's fantastic for her career. You know, now to be successful, everyone has to push. I've never met anyone that's pushed an artist so hard. - Where's your vitamin C stuff? I'm going to make you one, too. - Oh, er, in my purse, where's my purse? - Gary, he's super proactive. We do have a few battles where I'm very protective of Kate. I can kind of tell when, you know, she needs to sleep. That's where we have battles, you know, and, er... But that's how it should be. Absolutely maximising the most out of her time, and, yeah, really hitting all the marks, you know? - SHE SINGS A SCALE: # Ya-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhh # I'm really, really nervous! # - Shit, you've done this 1,000 times. - I know. - Stealing three towels from your room. At least there aren't any there... And we're off to Bird's Nest Stadium. - HE SINGS A SCALE: - # E-ee-ee-ee-ee-eeee. # One more whisky? Nah. Where's our guy? Is that him right there? - OK. - We're on our way. - I feel sick, I'm so nervous. - Come on, guys, we are in a rush. We need to do make-up and get her dressed first. I'm sorry, you can't ask me last minute to do press stuff. Where's the dressing room? - OK, we're heading to the dressing room right now. - No, this is the press room. - Not here, I'm so sorry. It's next door, it's next door. The first door, left, left. - Dressing room. - Can we all go out and let her get dressed? Everyone. - # You can spend your whole life # Getting down on one thing # You can waste all your time on one idea # But what you gonna do now, baby, when it all caves in? # Touring for the record, I worked harder than I've ever worked in my life. I didn't have one day off for two years. I do like being independent in terms of being able to, like, make all the decisions and be a control freak about my art and about my live show and about everything. - I'm transforming Kate into a warrior boss bitch. - With Lollapalooza, getting there was just such a big deal cos I was like, I actually can do this and with no record label. CROWD CHEER # You don't treat me like a friend, yeah # You don't treat me like a friend # I've been saving all this stuff inside of me for you # But you ain't giving me the best # You were cool # You were cool # You were cool # You don't treat me like a friend # I ain't giving you my best # You don't treat me like a friend, yeah # I ain't giving you my best # I coulda told you the things that we'd do # I coulda told you the fun that we'd have, yeah # I coulda told you the stuff that we'd see # Ah, ah, ah. # It was really fun, though, wasn't it? - It was so good. - My first thought was, like, crowd surf! - And then you go, you're climbing back. - THEY LAUGH I, like, every single one of them, I held, like, their bums, to make sure they didn't fall down. - My mum said, "Saw you, great show, so many people. "You girls killed it! Amazing show. Keep on shining." - I live for touring. I love it. But I wasn't making money off those tours. It was costing me more to tour, you know? So, I've had some times throughout this year when I'm like, well, maybe I should try and like figure out a different way of making money. I moved to America to make my next record. Where are we? LAUGHING: - We're in Burbank. - Where the fuck is that? So, the British music industry and media is kind of dominated by what's hot right now. Whatever the version of that is. Like, that's not me. And I've just found America to have more exciting options for me. Look at all the stuff I could buy. I want everything in this shop. Like, everything. - 449. Look at this! Polaroid. - And LG. - 358. 279, that's the TV you're getting. And it's cheaper. - All right, boom, sold. Sold. Sold to the crazy lady in the cat T-shirt. - I want to rudely interrupt. You are Kate Nash, cos I've got your music. - Oh, that's so cool! - What're you doing in...? - Well, I moved here, and I'm writing my next record. - Really nice to meet you. - Really nice to meet you, thanks for saying hi. I want to put my next record out on a record label, cos I love doing it independently, cos of how much it's taught me, but, er, it's definitely difficult. It's hard to be starting from scratch again, especially financially, after working for so many years. KNOCK ON DOOR Stella. I've got a dog. I rescued a dog called Stella off the streets. I love you. STELLA PANTS I think that means she loves me. too. Look, I'm going to put this up here, look. Alicia is, like, my best friend and my drummer. She's really awesome. - Kate was looking for a drummer and I was, like, Kate Nash, yeah, that'd be cool for me, I like her. The description for, like, what she was looking for in a drummer said, "A female that looks like Joan Jett "and plays like Travis Barker." And I was like, well... ..OK, yeah, I get the Travis Barker, like, playing hard, and energetic, and not just like, you know, whatever. So I was like, that's me. But then I was like, the Joan Jett thing, that could either mean she wants a cool rocker chick like me, or she wants a white girl with, like, dark hair and whatever. So, I was like, I don't know, I think maybe she wants a white girl. - SHE LAUGHS - So... - Which way? - This way. - OK. Heave ho. Take it slow, take it slow, please. Working on songs and working on my record is my main priority and focus at the moment. But also, like, I studied theatre at school and I was very passionate about that and wanting to be an actress. So I would like to explore, like, film and theatre. I definitely want to prove something in the acting world. - I love it. - It's good, right? I really just feel like I'm at home now. - Good. Well, now, you can stay here for, like, five years! - KATE LAUGHS I also want to sign a publishing deal, cos I need money. A publishing deal is not a record deal. It is being paid to write songs. So, I want to write songs for other artists, write for movies and, like, adverts... IN AMERICAN ACCENT: ..commercials. But my deal, I was given a chunk of money to live off of. It's kind of so that you can afford to be an artist and just make songs. This is so sweet. Get off! Don't you dare touch them! - So, we'll get her a publishing deal and then we'll work on her record, keep working on her record, then go from there. Hopefully, I'll be able to get her a recording deal in the next probably two or three months. Kate was so adamant about this record getting out there that she wanted to spend her own money, and that's part of the reason now I want to put this through a major I don't want Kate to spend her own money. - Great deal, good job. - Yeah, looking forward to working with you. SHE LAUGHS - Kate and I have a really great relationship because we actually started out as personal friends. - I haven't signed a deal in seven years. - I know, it's so great. I wouldn't say that it's Kate starting over, but, it's Kate jumping back into a world that she consciously chose to leave. She's now wanting to get back into that world that, you know, created Foundations and gave her a multi-platinum-selling record. We're not selling as many records. What worked ten years ago isn't relevant now. So, there's definitely going to be some culture shock, I think. - Camcorder. - SHE LAUGHS - Put the headphones on so it looks professional, in this cardboard box of doom! - The publishing world is about people writing songs for other people. So, I go into sessions and we write pop songs for other artists. SHE SINGS Wait, I was out then. SHE FINDS THE NOTE - # I still do it for you # Cos I'm... # - No, let's get another one. - # Just a family vibe. # - Going to write another one. I love writing songs. A lot of these songs just get lost, no-one ever hears them, and they never get picked up. No-one's getting paid, either, so you only really see money back if you get a number-one hit or something. I want to do it again. SHE SINGS Oh, I did a different thing then. - Yeah, always punching. - But I like that. - Yeah. But do it one more time, just the ending. The same one. - SHE SINGS - That one, that's great. You know, it's very, very difficult to get a cut. It just is. It's just very hard. So, we're going to have a bunch of stacks of the same thing. - SHE SINGS - I think that's cool. It's like a lot of label execs are just half asleep, listening to the song that you slaved over for days, sometimes weeks, sometimes months, it doesn't matter. And they're listening to the first ten seconds of it, and then they're skipping to the next one. - SHE SINGS - Songs don't really make a lot of money these days. You know? Streaming sort of killed that. - HE PLAYS GUITAR - It's not just about, get your song on the radio and hope you have a hit and hope it works, cos business is changing all the time. Now, with social media, to tie in streaming opportunities and brand partnerships and all the different ways of breaking an act now, that just weren't even around ten years ago. I'm constantly approaching agencies because it's a good opportunity for Kate to build a relationship. - KATE DOES VOICE EXERCISES - Upshot Marketing Agency, we do a lot of great stuff with musicians and other artists, and Live Nation brought over Kate Nash. - What will you do with Kate? - Oh, hm. We have a great portfolio of brands, the sky's the limit. How about that? - HE LAUGHS - We're going to perform in front of the people in this office, provide their entertainment for the lunch. - SHE LAUGHS - I know. - CHEERING SONG INTRO STARTS # You don't treat me like a friend, yeah # You don't treat me like a fri-e-e-end # I've been saving all this stuff inside of me # But you ain't giving me the best. # - Those things, you may not see the immediate payday, but she went up there, she won them over, she talked to everybody, she performed. Those things go a long way. You know, my job is to bring opportunities to my artists. We had an opportunity recently for a commercial. - Ye-ow! That was kind of cool! - It was kind of, I'll save that one, cos we can put a couple of them in. - Ye-ow! # Poor me, poor me # You must take pity on poor me # Ye-ow! # - Yeah? - Yeah. - We're here doing a couple of commercial spots, and it's pretty much, it's one spot, but we're providing three different songs. They're cover songs, they're old blues and old spiritual standard songs, so it's kind of fun giving them a new twist to things. - # Yeah, you'll come back one sweet day # Yeah, you'll come back # One sweet day. # - I believe it's some sort of a face product commercial, or, like, a face wash... ..I believe. So, it's, er, yeah. - I said weird things. It's just such a weird world. - Yeah. - I just got a call-back, another call-back, for this HBO witch, Jenji Kohan, Gus Van Sant, pilot. So, I am sick, I'm under tremendous strength. "Tremendous strength"? I'm really sick, so I can't speak. I keep saying the wrong words at the minute, and those are words from the pilot. Focus. But I'm going to deal with it, and I'm going to go and do a good audition, and I'm dressed like a witch, kind of, from the 1600s. And I hope I get it. # Wish me luck, my house is a mess, loads of stupid shit. # - Kate is not just an artist, she's an actress, she's a great combination of everything. Um... I do hope, though, that she gets back to, you know, focusing on her record now, because right now we're very behind schedule. There's a lot of pressure on Kate with this next record. There is. And she knows it and I know it and the whole team knows it, so, I know that she doesn't want to maintain where she's at, she wants to build and grow. So, that's the scary part... ..for all of us. Ah! - Is it on this street, or is it on the other street? Mystery... Where am I? Where am I? I do like this drive-through pharmacy. I'm picking up. It's for Kate Nash. The American Dream. I need to get back to my career, so I need to create something that some label out there wants to be part of. - How are you doing? - So, I'm packing for CMJ, which is a festival in New York. It's quite funny, because I have never played CMJ. Like, a lot of new bands that want to get signed go there, kind of thing, so I think it's quite funny to, like, be going to CMJ like I want to get signed, man. Alicia? - Yeah? You got me a brown one? - Yeah! SHE LAUGHS Or I can have the brown one and you can have the white one. See? - Oh, yeah. - I'll be nervous before the show, because I always get nervous before shows, but I'm glad we're playing because I really believe in the show. I'm just really happy that we have the opportunity to show off our live show to the industry. You know, thinking about signing a deal, what's it going to be like to answer to people again? Are they going to be trying to fit, you know, a square into a circle-shaped hole? But, like, hopefully, there's a label out there that, like, gets me and is enthusiastic about me and that is really rooting for me. CHEERING I'm Kate Nash. Thank you so much. # I think about death all the time # Do you think that's morbid? # I'm not like the other girls # Don't get me started # But I'm try-y-y-y-ying # I'm not ly-y-y-y-ying # When you're in my head # Well, I wish I was someone else # Mad at me again # And that's not even what I said # What's wrong with me? # Am I a person yet? # What's wrong with me? # Wish I could let my brain # Decide and stop the pain # I keep heart-shaped glasses close to me # For when it rains # Life in pink # I wish I could let my brain # Decide and stop the pain... # So, nothing happened. Nothing happened with CMJ. Nothing came from it. It was a fucking waste of time, to be honest with you, for my career. I just got home. I was at the airport for, like, eight hours. I still have disgusting, like, glitter in my hair. I have like a million spots. My flight was really delayed, it's, like, six in the morning, I found out some really bad news. And, um... I'll talk about that tomorrow, I suppose. It's pretty bad, though. And it's weird. And it's light outside and it smells really nice and flowery, and it's nice to be home, I just...can't wait to see Stella. BARKING Right, tell everyone what's happening. - Now, we're dealing with a situation here today where Kate's...manager, former, soon-to-be former manager, has stolen a large sum of money. So we're dealing with that this morning. It was a long night. We were up until four in the morning. We're just going to figure it out, OK? OK. - I spoke to my accountant, he gave me the records of, like, my credit card spendage over the last two months. And I thought I'd lost the fucking plot, because he was, like, you've spent more on your card in the last two months than you've ever spent your whole life, basically, your entire career that I've known you. I looked through all these charges, and I couldn't recognise a lot of them, and I found one that I did recognise, but not because of me, it was something in California, a location in California, on a date when I was in London. And, um... It just flagged up in my mind immediately, and I checked my manager's Instagram, and he was tagged, he tagged himself in that location on that day. OK, so, my manager Gary was paying for his wedding with my credit card. - You know I've got you covered, Nash. - # One fateful night I was driving around town # It was late, I was tired and feeling down # I like to drive to take my mind off all the stuff # That stresses me out and that keeps me up # And sometimes when I'm driving I put two and two together # I'd read the e-mail earlier that day, but though, "No, never." # Surely it couldn't be, surely this wasn't true # The person who betrayed me, who stole it all was you # I took my life # And I held it right in front of him # To teach him a lesson # In suffering # And now he sleeps # He sleeps with one eye open # God knows # Well, God knows I've told him # I had it out so I could show him # Now he's sleeping with one eye open... # This is, this is insane, this is mental. - Right, it's been a rough day here. It's been a pretty rough day. - It's not even, like, two o'clock yet. - Give us an update. Why are you on the floor? - Because I tried to get my manager to meet me to break up. And I was freaking out. And he's sending me a billion texts. But he's turning it around on me. He's saying that I've been really difficult to get hold of. He presumed I had personal issues. He's just, like, blaming me, putting stuff on me, it's guilty behaviour. He's flipping out. And I just want to be, like, "Are you fucking high?" JAUNTY ELECTRONIC MUSIC I'm going to call my accountant to find out if the money's back in or not. I'm OK, how are you? Fuck. That's really upsetting. No, because he's avoiding me now, he doesn't want to see me today, he's no time to see me. OK, well, I'm going to text him now. You, too, thanks, bye. It doesn't make any sense, any of it. Money just makes people fucking weird. I just can't imagine caring about it that much that you would need to steal from someone. Like, now that my trust has been taken advantage of so many times, and something like this, I just don't know, I don't know how to move forward. Without becoming...like, hardened. And really changing who I am. This industry sucks, like, so many people suck. But I've got enough left in me to go, well, fuck it, I'm going to make my own songs. Because it's important to, like, remember that, like, why you started doing it in the first place. - So, what's on, what's been on your mind, what do you need to get off your chest? - I'm feeling really angry with my old manager today. Because I had a business meeting about my financial situation. And he, like, stole loads of money from me. So there's that. - Oh, that sucks. - Yeah. - Let's see what we can cook up. So, the first time I met Kate, our initial conversation was all about this idea that songs can be so boring if they adhere to too many rules. This idea that a song has a chorus, a song has a verse, a song has this and has that. It very often becomes this thing where you're ticking boxes. So, when we were going to write together, we were going to throw that out of the window and be, like, what do we feel should come next? - I want to be, like, running, and, like, dancing, and people to feel like they're spinning around. - I feel you. - I love doing it. - Just something completely different. She came in and was just, like, furious about the world. And she wanted to, like, channel that into a piece of art. - I want to sing about, like, everyone telling you what to be and what you have to do, and just being, like, I'm going to break away from that. - She's got a very strong idea in terms of what she wants to, how she wants to sound vocally, and what she wants to say. I'm just the midwife. I'm just helping these things be as good as they can be. I just started playing some, like, monotone, staccato, almost, like, an annoying kind of alarm clock. - I like starting with something weird like that, like, just one note. - Anyway, there were these dramatic chord structures underneath. Or hinted at some, like, big drama. And she'll start writing these raps. - RAPS: I was running It was a cold night I feel breaths are heavy on my chest, I see it like smoky white I turn around, to see if I'd lost them now, a chase... Oh, wait, I need to start again. - This frantic spoken-word thing about self-loathing and self-doubt, and you just keep going, no matter what. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's nice. I love this. - OK, cool. - I don't know what the fuck it is, but I love it. She needed to say this shit, and I just provided this kind of soundscape underneath it. - RAPS: I really squeeze it, I mash it up so hard inside my hand I'm almost sure that I killed it, I check it for a pulse But I can't remember ABC correctly, one, two, three One, two, three, one, two three... The music industry's brain works differently to mine, so things that I think are, like, normal, are probably really weird. I think I feel a beat I really need you still Come on, I really need you, get up... It's just not easy, is it? Making creative projects isn't simple, I'm sure everybody has those struggles with things. RAPS: Holes and toes and elbows I shove it up inside me so it knows Never to scare me like that again Never to leave, always to stay Never go away... - I love being in the room with her. And I love creating. I love those moments that we have when it's, like, that's amazing. "Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God." - With the cat. - But I'm not the only one working on this project. There's probably, like, 30 of me. I have no real idea of how many people at this point are involved in songs. There's no sense of direction. It's taking so much time, we can't get any commitment on dates. It's actually super frustrating. - My brain literally doesn't really understand the concept of, like, being on time. It's something that I try and work on always, like... sometimes I'm late because I've started writing a song, and sometimes I'll get, like, wrapped up in doing something creative and distracting. It's hard to be thinking in all these different directions constantly. I want to be a musician, I want to be an artist, that's what I'm comfortable being. - Just getting something out there and getting things moving is the best thing you could do right now. You can get signed to a label and they could shelve you. You could put it on the internet. - Yeah. - I would love to help Kate create in the way that she wants to and to do it her way. I would need to know what her very clear vision is. And what she wants to accomplish. You know? I can't create that for her, and it's her art. - It's, like, what you were saying, remember, like, why. - You're doing this. - Yeah. - You can play amazing shows, like, you do have all of this following and fans, but right now, it's stagnant. - Yeah, yeah. - Like, you need something that's going to bring all that back, you know? - Yeah, yeah. - I think that this business, for lack of a better way of explaining it, really fucked her up. You know? I think she's been put through the wringer. It's very easy for her to get detoured. And it's a business that you have to put 110% into. You know? It's not for the faint of heart. - Um... It's not going that great. Oh, fuck, it's always sooner than I think. So, I'm going to be re-record vocal with my friend Jeff, who's really nice. He is, like, a Grammy-award-winning mixer. And he, um...engineered Girl Talk. And he's going to mix, he's, like, helping me out for free. And I need to re-record these vocals on Life In Pink, there's one section where I'm kind of shouting. And record labels don't like that, they don't like shouting. I think it sounds cool, but I'm into punk music and rock music, and I need to make a pop record, because I don't have any money. As a woman, you can't even scream on an album. But as a man you can talk about raping bitches and it's fine. What are we doing right now? We're broadcasting live. - The bullshit answer is you're recording vocal for the album, and it's because we want to do something a little alternate from what we had previously recorded, and, so that's what we're doing right now. - And now give the real answer. - The real answer is you selfish fucks don't pay for music, so we have to make something more commercial, and remove some screams so you cunt record label executives will actually give us money to finish the album, OK? A little high. - # When you're in my head # I wish I was someone else... # I don't know if I'm going to be able to sing it. My voice is so shot right now. - We're almost there, we're almost ready to make a record. - # ..When you're in my head # Well, I wish I was someone else... # They just want, like, "Aaaah". Not really, but I can't sing how they want me to sing. # ..When you're in my head # Mad at me again... # SINGS FLAT Wait, whoa! - You really want to shout it. I feel that. - # Mad at me again... # Fuck, it's like I'm not hitting it every time I'm recording it. - Your pitch is fine. - OK. - It's just, your voice sounds a little, like, tired. - # Well, I wish I was someone else # Mad at me again # And that's not even what I said # What's wrong with me? # Am I a person yet? # Am I a person yet? # - Look at yourself when you're saying that, and be, like, what's wrong with me? - # What's wrong with me? # Am I a person yet? # What's wrong with me? # - Let's try it one more time. - # What's wrong with me? # Am I a person yet? # What's wrong... # I just text my landlord... And told him that I have to move out. And it's just kind of, like, facing reality, I guess. I still haven't been paid back by my ex-manager, so I'm going to get a place with, like, cheaper rent. I have a bunch of clothes here I can sell. It's just about getting resourceful, becoming resourceful, and, like, making things happen for yourself, and that's kind of, like, what I'm doing right now. You know? It... Does it suck? Yes, but, like, it's also just, like, all right, is just the next chapter of life being, like, served up. And it's not that bad. I'm healthy. I'm alive. I'm on this planet. I have a dog. I have good friends. I have music. So, what more do you need than that, really? There's a million other people out there that have it worse than I do, and I'm just getting on with it, you know? Just got to get on with this shit. Hey! She has abandonment issues. She thinks I'm leaving her. It's OK. It's OK. I had my first job and I was 14. I've always worked for, like, what I've got. Like, I have my mother's Irish working-class roots, and it just feels wrong to be, like, in debt and not working. It would be weird to, like, get a job in a cafe and be recognised, or something, but if it came to it, if I had to get a job in a cafe, or whatever, like, I would. - That's going to be 237.40. - Cool. - There you are. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Take it easy. - Bye. Thanks. I just hate not earning money. So I am going to a comic book store because I'm going to work there. I got a job. I'm doing a live streaming show, and I, like, sell products. Are these anything specific? - That's Imperial. - Oh. - And then this is the Rebel. The blaster, the R2. The Storm Trooper. And then the Obi-Wan sabre ring. - And then this one? - That's based on the floor of the Millennium Falcon. - Oh, yeah. Are we all in the right place? - Mm-hm. - What do you guys think? I'm the founder of XSN, the shopping network for geeks and millennials, and I'm always looking for hosts and cool products to sell. Shall we start in a different language? Can you just start in Elvish? - In Elvish?! - Everyone that I've told about Kate coming in, everyone's freaking out, especially my sister, my nieces. They're like, "Oh, my God, I grew up on her music." - That's awesome. - So it looks like Kate's exploring these new opportunities. - Hello, everybody, we're live. This is Shop XSN. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say this is a very special moment. We levelled up. This is the angelic Kate Nash, ladies and gentlemen! - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here. - Why don't we start with the Chewbacca guitar pick? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - Rock and roll, huh? - It's a real guitar pick size. - Real guitar pick size... ..and I'm a rock star, so I can verify that for you. - That's right. - Great. - Let's get the next one ready. - Let's do it. - We have the 4-8C Blaster, and that one is available in silver and gold. - So, come on in now. Valentine's Day is coming up, everybody... - I'm really confused about what's going on in my life right now. I'm like, "How do I get myself out of this hole?" I filed a lawsuit against Gary. Because that fucker didn't pay anything back and... ..broke his everything. Broke his word, so I've filed a lawsuit. That's going to be fun. - What happened with Kate and Gary, sadly, it happens a lot in the music business. We're in a business where the bad guy definitely succeeds a lot of the time. And then the craziest thing is that even though they could have the world's worst reputation, in this business, there's a large group of people that find that reputation to be cool and awesome and badass. It can be very discouraging. - Maybe I'll just sleep here on like... We'll just sleep on a dog bed. - Yeah. Well, you could. - And then bring her in the morning. - You could. - I think I'm going to do that. - OK. - I like to take a lot of trips outside of LA, just to get back to nature. Coming into nature reminds me why I like this country and being alive, really. It just gives me a bit of perspective. I don't know if I'm losing perspective because I'm so stressed out. I don't mean to sound ungrateful for all the things that I do have, but I've been putting things out of me constantly for two years with no return, and I'm not doing my job, which is such a huge part of my life. That also has been shitty because then I'm like, "Oh, what else do I do?" I don't know how to make... I don't know like... SHE SIGHS I don't know. SHE SNIFFS I feel like I don't know how to, like... ..be a real person, or something. I don't know how to make money outside of being on tour or making a record. I just think I need to go to England. I don't know. I just need to go home. # I was running # It was a cold night # I felt breath so heavy on my chest # I see it smoky white # I turn around # To see if I had lost them now # I chase, I'm run...I'm running # I'm run...I'm running out of time # And I feel it faster # I hear the footsteps catching up on me # I bite my lip so hard # I bite the skin off completely # I feel the blood about to drip # I save it with my tongue # It tastes like metal # I tell myself # No matter what happens tonight # That everything will be OK # Yeah, everything is going to be all right # I'm not sure if believe it... # London and living here, growing up here, all the incredible memories that I have here, the attitude of the people and the grim nature of waking up every day to grey skies. It's gloomy every day, and just the way that affects us living here and growing up here. You know, that's my roots. This is where I grew up. Smile, Dad, you're on candid camera. Max! - Oh, am I on that? - Yeah. - Oh, bum! We're both really worried about Kate. It is going to be really hard for Kate to be short of money. Here, young lady, come and eat this. - Stew. - It is a stew. - An Irish stew. - You're an Irish woman and there's absolutely nothing wrong with an Irish stew, let me tell you. Eat it while it's hot or it'll be horrible. She went from living at home where all her bills were paid, to people working for you and with you. When Kate first got signed by Universal and just seemed to have so much money, I wish that she'd almost had a few years in a flat where she had bills to worry about and things to pay, and wondered how the toilet roll suddenly was under the sink at home, and it didn't happen that way in her flat, and things like that. Just learnt to live. She never had that. - Hi! - She doesn't like to talk about money with us. She never has done. She's always been a little bit uncomfortable with it. She's never been totally at ease with earning lots of money. She gave money away. She started her... It was supposed to be a tax break, I think. It was called Have 10p. It certainly wasn't 10p that people were getting. It was considerable sums of money, really. And she got very involved with other charities and things. She visited schools, teaching girls about music. - What are you interested in? - I sing a lot. - You sing? - Yeah. - OK, one, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. - It was her way of giving back a bit to people who she felt hadn't been as lucky as she was. - There's such a big gender gap in the music industry. We really need to do something about it, and all of us here need to change that. I don't know if you already have instruments. If you don't, we can get those provided and brought into the schools. We brought our own instruments. That's probably part of my mistake. I definitely invested in every project that I did and funded things myself. Now I know you don't actually do that. You're supposed to get other people with loads of money to pay for things. SHE SINGS SOFTLY That was so cool. I nearly cried. - I used to think, when she was travelling around the world and coming back exhausted and too tired to really talk to us when she did eventually get out of bed, that maybe I wish she was a teacher in Ruislip and teaching little ones about music and poetry and art, and all the nice things in life. - And I realised that the best way to get over a lot of my issues was to just write music and go and rehearse on my own and stuff, you know? And get it all out of your system. All this stuff! Oh, wow, look. Old scrapbook. This has got so much shit in it. First-ever tour passes. Made Of Bricks tour, '07/'08. I don't miss myself being a star in the way I used to be because I don't think I've ever really seen myself that way. And I also was very uncomfortable with that. I didn't like going to awards ceremonies. Let's take a look at the shortlist. It didn't make me happy and it's not something I'm attracted to, really. And the winner is... ..Kate Nash. It's really weird how quickly life gets really different, isn't it? It feels like a lifetime ago now. Mind your head. When you look back in life, there's moments where the universe really does kind of swing you a certain way. When I was younger, I was very set on going to drama school. "That's my path and I'm going to be an actor." OPERA MUSIC PLAYS I got rejected from all of them. If I had have gone to a drama school or university, the fact is I wouldn't be a musician now. I wouldn't have the career that I've had. But acting is still another dream of mine. I heard about this audition and I was like, "Oh, God, I have to addition for that." A Netflix series called Glow, based on a real group that existed in the '80s, a league of female wrestlers called the Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling. That's right, ladies, get ready to be extinct! I just worked really hard at the audition. I created a video that was pretty special and strange. Fact. I'm about to drop 32 volumes of pain on you! Argh! So I've sent my audition tape to Glow. There's nothing left to do now except wait and see. This is old Reading. This is where we used to go all the time when we were kids to play in the woods. I wanted to take the dogs to the woods because that's what we always used to do, and these are my grandad's boots, so I'm looking cool. Look at the frozen moss. Now I feel calm and rooted. Coming home, it's funny how immediately I feel grounded, I feel better, I feel safer, I feel more myself. Now I'm going out into the big, bad world and scared of putting on the brave face that I've put on every day for ten years doing this. And I actually want to get to a point in my life where I'm settled and calm like I am when I'm at home. Saying goodbye. I'm not really sure about how I feel about returning to LA. I do have to face my manager in court there, so I'm going back. - You don't have time for that now. - But look... - Come on, you're going to be late. Kate! Shift your ass, you're going to be late. - How many times have you said that to me in my life? - 10 million. - THEY LAUGH Thanks for taking me to the airport, Mum. Are you going to miss me? - Nah. Of course I'm going to miss you. - What is your advice to me as a woman in the world today? - To be able to look in the mirror and look yourself in the eye and know you haven't done anything that you, personally, would be ashamed of. And I think that's not a bad code to live by. We all do things that we regret, but, yeah, to be able to look yourself in the mirror and think, "Yeah... I did the best I could." Does that sound like a piece of advice? - Yeah. OK. I just need the air conditioning to work. I can't last in this fucking town without aircon. This is fucked up. It's November right now and look at my outfit. Look at my hat, look at my sunglasses. Are you going to ask me questions? - For this one, you're just going to talk about what happened. - OK. So, I went to court with my ex-manager. I decided that I was going to look him in the eye when he came down the corridor, and he couldn't look at me. Wow, you can use my credit card to pay for your wedding, but you just can't look me in the eye after doing it? My lawyer said, "OK, it's kind of getting to the point "where we think we're going to be closing "and it's looking really good." And then Gary decided that he wanted me to sign a piece of paper that said I could never talk about this. And it's funny how these things sound really official, but in reality, it literally... I was given a scrap of paper, with a line written in pencil by his lawyer, of what the term was. It's just a scrap of paper that would completely change my life if I agreed to it. And the lawyer said to me, "This is where everything could fall apart." I just remember sitting on the bench and taking a moment to myself to think about everything that's happened in the past few years and what I believe in. I thought about all the moving that I've done and craziness with money and thought about not being able to have Stella and how am I going to have a career and what am I going to do? But my freedom of speech is, like, fucking priceless. So, even if it meant giving up the chance to get the money back, I would never sign that piece of paper, ever, because it's just not worth giving up my voice. So, I just said no. And then I just did a spell, basically. I was looking up and I just thought about my vagina and called on all the goddesses. I was like, "I'm just going to fucking do this spell "and I want to win this fucking court case." And then, all of a sudden, my lawyer came out and they said "He's signing it on your terms." He has to pay me back. That was it. It was kind of weird, actually. It just has been such an excruciating process, and then all of a sudden, it was just done. # Sweet dreams # My darling # Sweet dreams # Are you dreaming of me? # So I got Glow, which is amazing... ..and quite surreal. But I'm going to start training immediately, and then I'm going to be shooting a TV series, which is quite crazy. Oh, my God, I got the part! I got Glow! This role that I've got is, like, so special. It's my dream job that I never knew was my dream job. To go to work with 14 women on a TV show every day is so rare. We trained with Chavo Guerrero, who's a legendary wrestler from a family of wrestlers. I've just had a new physical relationship with my body. I'm stronger than ever in a physical sense, as well as mentally. Doing that with all these women was just so emotional too. It's fucking amazing to have a job, to get paid every week and be like, "Oh, my God, I have a job!" Stella, come on. Yeah? Come on. We've got to go. I'm actually really grateful for the experience of having all my money spent by someone else because it's just taught me... Like, when I moved to LA, it's the first time in my whole life when I ever said... I said it out loud, I remember being like, "I want to make as much money as possible. "I'm going to try and make as much money as possible." I told the universe what I wanted and the universe was like, "No, that is not what you're supposed "to fucking be here for and that's not "what you're supposed to care about." That's not why I make art and that's not why I make music, and for me to suddenly care about that, I think, was dangerous. I'm going to release the fourth album this summer and I want to do it through Kickstarter. So, in your opinion, what is it about Kickstarter that sets it apart? - Kickstarter is not taking any ownership. Artists are the major currency, even though they're the ones that are the least compensated. - Yeah. - And there are fans who are willing to pay a bit more to have a deeper connection and for you to do your art. - Hi, I'm Kate Nash, and I want my fans to be my record label. "Congratulations. Your project is live on Kickstarter." Look, she's so excited, she's going to kill me! The more money I raise on my Kickstarter, the more I can do. The ideal scenario is that we make way more than the original target. So, this is the first piece of vinyl I've released in four years. We're releasing Agenda early to the backers right now. I did kind of feel like a teenager doing Kickstarter because I just lived in my parents' house and stayed up every night really late. You're on the internet constantly. Even then, you might not get all the money that you want. Figuring out how to make money from music is a challenge these days because people want to listen to music for free. This might be the one. But at the same time, I do think there has to be a little bit more of an understanding that if you do want artists to have a career then you do have to pay them money because otherwise, I just have to get another job and then I can't make art on the level that I want. Linda, how long has it been since me and you have been on a little radio trip? - A long, long time, mate. - I'm in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign right now. You can go and pre-order my fourth album. Please do it. It makes sense because I started my career on MySpace. So it was just kids ruling everything, which was so cool. When I got dropped, it's the reason that I'm still able to be here because if I hadn't had access, like direct access, to my fans, I would have been really lost. We have 54 hours of Kickstarter left, probably 53 now. My arms are cramped up because of too much social media. It hurts. I feel like I've had 20,000 cups of coffee and I haven't had one. We've completed all our tasks for the day. Painted another guitar. We've doubled our target. We're at 140, but we want 150. It's really hard to explain to people that putting out a record costs 150 grand. That seems crazy. But if you have a 12-track album and you're paying a producer three grand a track, and then you have to pay for mixing for each track and mastering for each track and then you have to pay for radio and PR promotion, it can cost three grand a track for radio promotion... That's a lot of money adding up. - Somebody wants to know where you got your tiara. - I don't know. It's so cheap, though. It's like plastic. It's probably from a party shop. Do you want to know where I got my acne? From stress. Mum. - What? - Tell people why they should pledge for my album in the last 13 minutes. - Because she's, well, my daughter. I love her. I think she's brilliant, and I think you should pledge right now! - Yeah! How long left now? - Five minutes! - Argh! - Three minutes. - Oh, my God, even I'm getting stressed. - Oh, my God, it's the final countdown. - ALL: Five, four, three, two, one! THEY SCREAM - Can we do another one now? - CROWD CHANTS: - Kate Nash! Kate Nash! Kate Nash! - CHEERS I appreciate all of you so much. You're literally the reason that I'm able to continue to do music. I'm so grateful. I love doing this. I'm like sitting there and I can't believe it's my job. I always say, music isn't fluffy, it's life or death. This is fucking life or death. You know it because it's saved you before. It saved me. And that's fucking amazing. That really is important. This is a brand-new song, it's unreleased. It's called Call Me. It was such a relief to hit our target and now it's kind of crazy to think I'm going to be able to put this album out and move on from it. # So if there's anything that I can do for you # Well, honey, pick up the phone # You can call me, baby... # My fans were as open and as exposed and vulnerable as I feel like I've been and I feel like people have told me that I am and I thought it was a flaw. # You can call me, baby... # I just wanted to cry playing it because I was so happy that that's who I am. I was like, "This is why I'm this fucking open person." I have these fans. They're giving to me what I've given and I'm receiving it, and I'm receiving all this love. I'm glad I'm that person and I'm glad I've been vulnerable, and I'm glad I put that into my music. It's a really beautiful thing. OK, we're going to split. Split you into two. We're going to do some audience participation for this one if you're up for it. Are you up for it, London?! CHEERS OK, good. So this half, just kind of split. # You're the one with the sun # Feel the power and lift me up... # Louder! # You're the one with the sun # Feel the power and lift me up # You're the one with the sun # Feel the power and lift me up # You're the one with the sun # Feel the power and lift me up... # This whole experience has been, ultimately, very valuable to me in ways I didn't expect. That's it. That's the end of the movie. # My head is underwater # And I can't see the light # I guess you overstepped it # So go and hold me down and flush # Because, darling, I am in a rush # And I can hold my breath # Let's not forget # God knows I've had enough # If you check I'm a diamond in the rough # If you knew me # They know what I'm made of... # If in two lines she can explain, "I'm denying my heart for him." # And I call your bluff # Call me crazy, I'm velvet... # THEY SHOUT ALL: - Season two! Season two! - # What am I What am I # What am I made of? # - I couldn't do the tour because I broke my mouth. Who breaks their fucking mouth? I do. But guess what? I'm back! - # Forgive me for my sins # God knows I've had enough... # I can't believe it's actually happened, People have already listened to it twice. - Impossible... - This bunny just wished me congratulations. - Aw. - It is kind of impossible. - It just came out, like two minutes ago. - Well, maybe they just have it on repeat and they're like... I don't know how they're fucking doing it. Don't shoot the messenger! It's all popping off. We're doing promo, we're doing rehearsals. We've got 57 tracks that don't work. We're going to get a U-Haul. We're moving rehearsal space because we've been in a shit hole. - Things are looking up. - Classic Nash over here.
