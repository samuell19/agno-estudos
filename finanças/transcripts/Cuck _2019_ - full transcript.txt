At Valley Credit Union of Van Nuys you'll find... Looking from the top down, dividing us, pushing us even further apart I just don't know... In the name of the father, please lord... You hear a lot of talk about diversity these days... The male gaze has always framed our media and entertainment. The US Army, the army provides... Has been in Los Angeles real state for 30... Acts of confused rooms and professional victims in our media and our institutions of higher learning and at the core. At the core of their little horrified nightmare bedtime stories to scare their children there's a villain and that villain is white and he's male and he looks a lot like you and me. But the greatest threat to our nation is the fragmentation of our people with this false sense of diversity. The progressives have lulled the masses with the idea that somehow we need the influence of African and Hispanic cultures that we're not whole without them. That is the greatest fallacy of the past century. Diversity is merely a crutch for the parasitic tendencies that these cultures have on our own. The time has come that we are at full capacity. But these others rutting around in whatever godforsaken way they want in their own country. If we continue to play games with our border and immigration policy, it will be the death knell to real America. So, are you ready to take the red pill? Or are you just another cuck? Fuck, fuck! God dammit! If you bothered watching the fake news video which I do not recommend to... Anyone with a brain, please understand this, they have a goal or an obsession and that... Get my smokes? - What? - Devil's been after me for a cigarette. No, Ma, the doctor said no, you have to move to patches. No, baby. Come on, Ma! Been about a job yet? No, the the army hasn't let me know yet. Where's my checkbook? Ronnie! Gotcha, fucker. Come on. Come on. Today we're shooting with an M4. I'm going to get me some trespassers and I think I've found one. Fuck that fuck up. Oh, buddy. Don't forget about my chew, wintergreen. That's mint. What? That's mint, I said wintergreen. Bad for you, the mouth cancer. Your mother signed this check? Because it is 75 quote unquote psalms before you get over that hump and when you get over that hump you keep going you don't stop just like our lord and savior. Jesus Christ didn't stop, didn't beg for mercy. Lord Jesus Christ we are not strong like him... But we can strive and all we can do is strive and hope one day to meet our salvation in a meaningful way. Commends us to start determining Saint... But it's just math, 80 percent of women are seeking that top 20 percent of men and if you want to compete with the Chads that's who you got to be. Hey, 'scuse me. What? What're you listening to? What? Are you listening to music? My name's Ronnie. Fuck off. Look, I'm sorry. You know, you don't have to be a fucking bitch. You know what my grandpa had? He had a pension. But people don't even know what that word means anymore, they think you're talking about some sci-fi gibberish. You mean I can have a real job? And raise a family, own a house? Have a retirement without all this bullshit. Yeah that's how California used to be. California was about farming and industry. It was about the American dream. Watch your fingers. Not anymore. It's all just a tax racket to keep us broke. Now they got the Muslims trying to break down the door. Demanding sharia law. I had some Middle-Eastern fella come in here trying to Jew me down on some brake pads and I'm standing there, I'm thinking I live in the greatest country in the world and I got to stand here and defend it against this caveman who thinks he's standing in the middle of some third world camel market or something. Fucking, my friend, oh my friend. Yeah, yeah I know what you mean, man. That's why I want to serve. That's why I want to go to the army. Well, they'll be lucky to have you, Ronnie. They'll be lucky to have you. Well of course they're all queers by now. Think you got to be transsexual to get in now. Yeah, shit that's probably true. - My friend. - My friend. Oh my friend, my friend! What are you doing? I said don't touch your father's things. Okay. I talked to your probation. He wants you to get a job. He's not my probation no more. Well, he will be when I make the call! I said I was fixing the car. With whose money? It's your fucking car. What? Ow! Chance Dalmain, we're excited to announce the release of his new book Threats and Promises. First of all it's an honor to back, Jim and I think the true credit for the book must go to the loyal subscribers that helped me get this project off the ground. What we're seeing more and more of, Jim, is the unification of like-minded patriots who've had enough of the liberal media's war on the American identity. We're tired of having minority victimhood and trans hysteria shoved down our throats. But unfortunately that's the battle that has been brought to us by these cultures with their identities that are so weak that they have to construct false narratives, these lies. Our company offers a lot of discounts to our drivers who are able to work high-traffic shifts. Holidays, professional sports, big concerts. You find that driver's license? Ooh, this is a state ID, where's your license? And social? I think it's somewhere in here. If you give me the number I can look it up. - Can I just mail it? - Sure. You know if you take out your phone I can show you how to use the app. I forgot my phone at home. Well did you at least bring your car? Fucking bitch! Hey, I got this clock, watch and a pretty good knife. The watch runs? Uhm, I was hoping maybe you'd fix it. Buy, sell, pawn, no repairs. Any way I can get cash today, up front? No. Is that real? The Desert Eagle? Yeah. 45, pretty isn't it? - Hell yeah. - Can I touch it? Cash first, 1200. Can you knock off like two maybe? Not a toy, 1200. No, fuck! Come on! Ronnie, what did I say? Just leave me alone. - Did you get the job? - No, 'cause your car's a piece of shit. Mouth, no obscenities in my house! I couldn't get the job! 'Cause your car! The engine, it blew up and now it's going to they're going to take it away and it's going to cost a fucking fortune. Oh, baby come here and give your mother a hug. You know, this wouldn't have happened if you were more responsible. What? You know that you've always been immature. You probably got mad and wore the car down. It was a good car. You think that this is my fault? Ronnie. Don't you fucking dare. Don't! Well sure, yeah I feel like people should be free to identify however they want to. The parameters of gender should be based on feelings and not science? Well, it's not about feelings. If I claim to identify as a woman can I get into women's shelters and blame my social intractability on my menstrual cycle? No, I'm not saying that at all, what does this have to do with anything? So does he have access to weapons, guns, knives, anything? No, no he's just angry. Okay, same as last time. Alright. Won't you have a seat. - Hello, Ronnie. - Sir. You know why your mother called me here tonight? Yes, sir. Y'know, frankly I'm... I'm tired of getting these calls. You've been off probation long enough, what's the problem? I'm just frustrated. No one listens to me. I feel like shit. I'm listening to you Ronnie, loud and clear. Now, I could cite you for a domestic, but I won't. If you touch your mother, that's a whole other story. We clear? - Yeah. - Alright. We haven't had a real man in this house in so long, thank you Officer. Okay, if he has any more outbursts we can refer him to county for a psych eval. Having a job would help him out a great deal. He'll have one this week, or you can take him in. - Goodnight, Ma'am. - Goodnight. Fucking bitch! I can't be fucking anything I need to be! This fucking country, you fucking hear me! I just get angry sometimes. There's a lot going wrong in this world. Right now, right? Lot of bad shit, huh? In our country... Today was a pretty rough day for me. I lost a lot of money and I lost a car and I lost a job. But everywhere I go there's illegals and they're running the show. They own everything. And they look down on you. My father was a real man. He died. In the Gulf War. Back when America cared about its heroes. But now we got these libtards running the show. You can't be proud to be white and male anymore. It's not politically correct. Everywhere you go people try and tell you what to be, what to think. Well, you know what? White men created this country. We created this country. But we're losing it, folks. But as real patriots, we got to have each other's backs. Because I don't want to lose this fucking country to sharia or fag pride, not on my fucking watch. Everywhere you go people try and tell you what to be, what to think. Not on my fucking watch! As real patriots we got to have each other's backs. Ronnie. My father was a real man. Ronnie I am proud of you. It will be the death knell to real America. Are you ready to take the red pill? Or are you just another cuck? You've done this work before? You know, I can push a mop. What kind of job you had before? No, I haven't 'cause my mom's sick and I take care of her. But I put in for the army, I want to end up there. We'll start you off part-time, trash and stocking the shelves. Maybe later you make cashier. Hey, I want to get some propane. Hey there, I just bought one of these, can you load it up for me? - Yes, ma'am. - Ma'am? Do I look that old? No. Hold on one minute. You look familiar, do I know you? I don't think so. You live around here? Well I'm actually... Oh, I got to take this. You forgot your receipt. Thank you. What's going on Ronnie? You're quiet. Eh, nothing. Women or money? How about both? Yeah I just need to... How do you fucking know if a woman is interested in you? Without fucking scaring her off? - I'm serious. - All right, I hear ya, well that's the game. You got to hold yourself up. Hold yourself up, really. Women smell weakness a mile away they don't like it, zips 'em right up. But it's on you. Yeah but they're all different now. They are, they're all different they think that all guys are out to fucking be rapists or pigs, I mean you just try to say hi to 'em and they freak out, they even hashtag about it. Ronnie, Ronnie listen to me. You got problems with women because you got problems with yourself. You get straight up here and it is going to rain pussy. 40 days and 40 nights I guarantee it. I guarantee it! Plop, plop, plop. All over you. I guarantee it, man. Ronnie would you come help me? Ronnie? Yeah, Ma, just give me a minute. Yes. Ronnie, get in here! Look at her, the old bitch. She won't ever let me alone. She gets something out of this, I swear. I mean, women, they're always trying to get more comfortable than they deserve. While a man has to get out there hunting for another job, competing with other men, she can just get lazy and soft. They think they're entitled to this shit. But there are other women who want to compete because they want an alpha male. So they paint themselves up and they look like sluts y'know, and then you look at 'em and they act all innocent, but here is why you got to be an alpha male, because everywhere you go, every culture man, stronger than woman. Women are weaker, women are weaker so they need a man to get them stuff. Got to know what you're dealing with. Yeah, that's it, stay strong. Patriots, stay strong. Fuck yeah. Hey. Yo, Reza! What're you doing in those books? What if somebody wants to come in and buy something? I'm studying, but I think my dad wanted you to change the heads before you started mopping. No, he didn't say shit to me. I think you just fucking study so you don't have to work. It's the SAT I'm trying to get into Stanford. Oh, okay, you're going to be Mr. Fancy Pants, huh? - Yeah. - Mr. fucking scholar, okay. Well, you know what? Condoms, I want some rubbers, I have a hot date tonight. I'm serious. Okay. $3.85 Do we get an employee discount? No. Keep the change. 'Cause come tomorrow, you're going to hear all the stories. Sure. Hey! I'm going to get some big news. Hey, Melanie... Hi Melanie. Hi, Ronnie. Hi, how are you, Melanie? I'm Ronnie. Well, it's Ronald but everyone's always called me Ronnie. Ooh, I'll have that. Madame Butterfly tea, please. Sure. So, I figure I just need one more semester at Season. I mean I could do another semester but I really want to push for UCLA, they have a much better program there and I dunno, I just kind of want to explore some place new. Right now I'm just happy that I can pay my bills and I'm finally getting to study what I love. So what about you, you seem kind of quiet. I have a job and I'm just kind of hanging out, y'know like I can't complain. Do you enjoy what you do? Mmm, no, but I mean who does, right? Maybe you could find something that you enjoy better. I'd really like it if I was in the military. Special Ops. I don't really know much about that. Why the military? What do you mean why? I'm just curious. Well, because there's a shitload of threats right now. We're getting threatened all the time and nobody's doing anything, so I want to fight for our country you know, they need men. I mean most guys in college today are cucks anyway, you know? - They're what? - Cuck. You know cuck, like a pussy. That's a derogatory use of that word, I find it offensive. Pussy? Why? Because you think pussy means weak. Anything a woman has is less than a man's? No, I got no problem with pussy. I just mean that men should act like men. You know, I mean you like real men, right? Admit it, all chicks do. - Chicks? - What? I... Nothing is untrue, what I said. You really think that you're going to support yourself with this bullshit arts degree? You know what, I think you would've been a lot more successful if you'd have gone to college. What is that supposed to mean? We are not a match, best of luck. Wait a minute, you can't go anywhere yet I bought you this fucking coffee. I bought you this, here no, look. Let go of me! You think you're better than me... Let go of me! - She said, let go! - Hey man! Okay no, no, no, I'm not a bad guy I'm just trying to talk to her but you're being a fucking bitch! You're being a fucking bitch! And that's why college is a breeding ground for this liberal communism. They're out to brainwash people, folks and they're succeeding by turning these women into fucking feminazis. Meanwhile, while men are out there trying to get real jobs that are useful to society, these women are tricked into studying this useless crap. What're you going to do with a women's studies diploma? Let me tell ya you're probably going to marry a rich guy like the gold digger that you are. You act like you're respectable, well you don't have any respect for average guys. Fucking gold digger. You work hard and wait for the vultures. You better believe it, patriots. They cheat too, guy with more money, nicer car, bigger cock, bam she's gone. And they get away with it, they get away with it 'cause they got all these guys who are white knighting around them. All these fucking losers who are trying to defend them, they want to fuck them, but they make me look out like I'm the bad guy. Any guy who defends feminism is a cuck. He's a cuck or a fag. That's it, that's all I got, signing off, patriots. Fucking bitch. God dammit. What the...? No, get out of here, no, I'm not dealing. - What do you need? - Need? Ah, shut the fuck up. Yo, Forrest Gump, yo, watch the car. Yo, you spraying my shit on purpose? Damn, fucked up the wax! Look at that fucking sign. What's it say? What's it say, it says no loitering on property. Oh, that's your rule, Opi? Why you calling me Opi? Yo, clean that shit up, Opi. Why the fuck you guys calling me Opi? Yo, clean this shit up with your tongue, boy. Why don't you go back to Africa with your legs, boy? Yo, what the fuck did you just say to me? You heard what I said. Go back to fucking Africa. You fucking nigger. - Punk. - Go back... Motherfucker. What the hell is going on here? Man, you all right? You niggers! You stupid niggers! And you, the both of you you fucking sand niggers, you're not Americans and you're ruining this place, just get out! You are fired, you hear? Fired! Get off my property before I call the police. Go back inside. What do you want? Um, I was wondering if you needed any yard work. Cand. Oh, hey there. This young man is wondering if we need help with the yard. I can do anything, anything you guys need. You know what, yeah, yeah I think we might have some work for you. The flowerbed in the front, huh? Yeah, we'll be out in a minute. Just right, the one on the left? To the left, the flowerbed. - Hey. - Hi. I thought maybe you could use some iced tea. Sure. It's good, thank you. You don't plant the planter. Here, what you do is you just give it a little light squeeze... and slide it right out like that. And you sort of loosen up the roots a little then slip it right in. Oops. Yeah, just like that. - Another one? - Yeah. Oh, let's do a purple one, okay? Purple. It's kind of blue. Perfect, oh that's great. And just like that. Do you have a girlfriend? Not right now. No? Huh, I'm surprised. - Red one? - Yes, please. - Want more? - Thank you. Yep, gentle, gentle. Now let's do a purple one. You got it. Thank you. Ronnie? Bill and I think you're pretty cool. We're going to party tonight if you want to join us. Party? We sometimes record it. Just for personal use. If that's... cool with you? That's it. Yeah, go ahead, come here, darling, it's okay. You like to watch? Yeah? Me too. Oh, that's it. Touch yourself. Come closer, Ronnie. That's it. Go ahead, play with yourself. On your knees. Yeah, oh yeah. Oh, let me see. Oh, that's it. Take your shirt off. That's it, that's it, baby. So we really like you, Ronnie. You like to party with us? Yes. We shoot a lot of our parties. Mainly for my VIP crowd, you know just stuff like you did tonight. You get paid. Seriously? Yeah. Two, three times a week. All you got to do is follow the script. Can you do that, Ronnie? Can you follow the script? Baby, I've been worried sick. It's some darn girl, isn't it? - No. - Some little thing - you've been seeing. - No. Did you have a good day at work? Yeah, yeah, it was good. Work's good. I'm sorry, I cannot help you. Please, I need the money, please. These are too old, they're crap. I try them, they all work, I swear. I have better ones in my store. Ten dollars, it's okay. I said no. Please I need the money. Excuse me, do you speak English? Do you speak English? He said no, he doesn't want your shit. That means get the fuck out. You still got the Deagle? I brought cash. Sold it earlier today. Shit, guess it's not my lucky day, huh. Well, what about that? How much? So, I've been reading some of your comments first of all thank you, a lot of patriots enjoyed my last video and I just want to say that I did it for you guys. I'm worried, I'm worried about the safety of this country as we get more and more of these immigrants in. We're not only seeing them take over stores and neighborhoods, but they're actively threatening us and trying to make us afraid. I mean, okay here's what happens, see, the liberal presidents that we've had, they slowly started giving more and more and more of these special snowflake rights to people who don't belong here. Everywhere you look you got liberal cucks screaming about black rights, Muslim rights, they say we're to blame, that we owe them something. They stir shit up these days because they know that the liberal Jews are going to print anything that attacks real white American men. So you best believe I'm going to stand my ground if I... if I need to. Look, I'm not racist I just know the difference between a black person and a nigger. Now the Muslims... don't even get me started they come in like rats, you just blink and they have taken over everything, every single store, they think that they're better than you. Makes their day to look down on a real American. Just because you got an upgrade from goat-fucker Syria that don't mean that you can come here and try and take away the freedom that we made for ourselves, for this country. You try and come over, take it away from me? Not on my fucking watch. Sayonara, bam! That's it. Signing off, patriots, stay strong. Yeah, that was pretty fucking good, you fucking... You come here... Not on my watch. Not on my fucking watch! Never look in the camera, Ronnie. So let's do it just like we practiced, okay? - Yup. - Okay. And action. Honey, I've been thinking. Oh, yeah? What? About what? About last night. You didn't leave me satisfied. I didn't? You lasted two minutes tops. I think it's getting worse, and your dick is too small. So you know you friend Jack from work? Well, I invited him over to show you how pathetic you are. Hey, sugar. Hey, buddy. - Look at all this ass. - Ooh, yeah. Let's get you out of these clothes. Yeah, oh yeah. That's what a real cock looks like. Ah, baby. Yeah, baby, suck it. That's right, baby. Suck it, baby. Suck it, yeah. Oh, suck that dick. Oh, baby. I want to fuck, take this off. Show me. Oh, yeah. - Fuck you, baby. - Oh, yeah. Fuck that ass. Get it up, honey. Can you get it up? Can you do it, can you get it up? Oh, yeah. That's a real cock. Oh, oh yes! Oh, that's it! Oh, I'm coming! Look at that pathetic little thing. Look at you, you're nothing, you're so sad, you're such a pathetic little man. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes. This is unreg, 38 special with a 58 range. Didn't do nothing, it's called a burner. Be careful out there. Got you, you fucking nigger. And, action. I thought you said you were married. I could never stay married to a man with a dick that small. But I thought you liked the car that I bought you, baby. Well, Antonio here loves bending me over the hood. That's right, baby. This is how a real man bends her over the hood. Yeah, oh yeah! Yeah. Oh like that, like that, yeah. Cut. - Get down by the bed. - What? You want to get paid or what? Don't chicken out on me, Ronnie. And, action. Oh, yeah, that's it. Are you ready, baby? - Yeah, baby. - You there? - Yeah. - Uh huh. Ready, I'm ready, yeah. And, right in his face. How do you like that dick? Ronnie... Wait. It was a shock, I know! Ronnie, look at me! You and me, we're a team, right, you understand? We just, we got to have each other's backs. But I didn't sign up for that. But you're great at what you do and we need you. Listen, we need to just spend some time together just you and me, don't we? Yeah, yeah. So tomorrow Bill's going off to Ventura. Come on over for a drink, okay? Okay, good. You did great, you did great. - Thank you. - See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. You really think it's funny? Well, you're either in AA or some sort of religious kook. So which one is it, Ronnie? Oh, it's neither, I just don't like the way that it tastes. Well, we're going to change that. Salt, tequila, lime, gimme your hand. Lick, drink, suck. Are you okay? The first one's always the roughest. Can I kiss you? Yeah. You want to do some crystal, it'll straighten you out? No, I'm okay with the drinks. Let's go outside. - Can I tell you something? - Yeah. You can tell me anything. I want to do something else with my life. Maybe get out of LA. Yeah, me too. I could take you away, I could take you away from all this. What do you think? I really like you, Ronnie. Do you like me? Yeah. Have you ever been with a woman before? Yeah. Uh, ooh! I love you. I love you. Whoa. How'd you sleep? - Fine. - I bet. Candy probably gave you a little something. Gave you a free one, huh? Yes, sir. Well she might've given it to you for free but that's my wife. Look, it's not... You want me to fuck you up? - No. - Then you got to pay. Okay, how much? 200 bucks. Can I get you a check? Mm-hm. Go on, Ron, why don't you get your clothes? Can't you do something about these guys? There's nothing I can do, I try to tell these guys don't come in with... - He's a fucking clown. - I know, there's nothing I can do about it. Excuse me, are you a veteran? - Yeah. - What unit? 54th battalion, Afghanistan. - Where? - All over. That's a First Gulf War uniform, you look a little young, bud. Stealing valor there, junior? Hey, I'm talking to you! Motherfucker. So a lot of people think that conceal carry holders are scary, yeah they think they're scary, well, you'd be right to be scared of this. That's a fucking 38 Magnum, it's real. Has enough power to kill a grizzly. That's why the liberals want it banned, yeah. But here's the thing, when the shit hits the fan, when the real bad guys take over you're going to want us on your side. When the time comes you're going to be begging us for help. But here's the thing, we don't have to do anything for you liberal cucks. You tried to take away our second amendment. So when the fire comes, you're going to burn. Whoa. Hello friends, especially all my SoCal subscribers. I am really excited to let you know about this event coming up, it's going to blow your minds. Of course, if you're all up to date on current events you've already heard the good news. Our president will be down in Anaheim to talk about immigration and laying that spiritual foundation for that wall. Of course, there's going to be plenty of protesters waving their commie signs. That's why we need you and your support to show up as well. I'll be there myself, promoting my new book. Advance copies are in, might have a few extra to hand out. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone there. All my fans, all those channels that I personally subscribe to, we are gaining ground in Washington, friends. I think it's only fair that we show our solidarity. There's a link in the description below, I hope to see you there. We're introducing to you a product that all the stars in Hollywood, California are using. All those people with the convertible down, wind in their hair, flying down the ECH. That's right, we're looking to transform your life into a new deluxe system. Ronnie, my smokes. Yeah, you want to be in it? Fuck yeah, you want to know what really pisses me off? What offends me, all these fucking sissies who care more about safe spaces on college campuses than our right to say what we want. If you want a safe space, stay the fuck home. You got any more? Don't pay attention to the trolls. All these fucking libtards are all over the place. And this place is a fucking snake pit. They're marching, screaming, you can hear 'em. Amping up for their own little snowflake rights. I have my papers and I did it the right way and I'm here in the United States and I'm extremely patriotic. I love our president and I just think people who are not from this country should, you know, leave. They just think they can sneak in, like that's not right, you know? Thank you. Patriots, live update, I'm down in Anaheim you wouldn't believe these libcucks down here. But Mr. Dalmain called on us, so we've come. There's a lot of people who are flat out anti-American. That's it for right now, signing off, patriots. Signing off in this. Get whatever you want, it's on me. Thank you, you sure? Oh, absolutely. I don't often get the chance to meet subscribers who have their own channel. So, you're trying to spread the word about real America? Trying to tell what's gone awry? Yes, sir, I mean that's why I pretty much started my channel, you know. All the problems we're facing, immigrants, all that. Yeah, I think you follow my views on identity-forming cultures, the systemic watering down of the white nation state. How I see it, we got to have real patriotism. You know, cause otherwise anyone could come in here and take this country away. To be honest with you, I am sick of the blacks and the Muslims, they're telling us what to do. Yeah. Yeah, you're quite astute. I can tell that the anger in your videos is real. I'm sure that's part of what makes 'em so popular. Thank you, Mr. Dalmain. Let me ask you a question, Ronnie. How far are you willing to go? What do you mean how far? Well, our country, it's shifting not just in terms of politics or morality, but culturally. Europeans are the creators. They stoked the fires of art and industry. But now we're losing the battle on a population front. All these Africans and Pan-Asian peoples. Hispanics, they're here to stay. We're in need of a great cultural revolution. It's theirs or ours. It takes an iron will to build a great civilization, and a small lapse in faith, that could cost us everything. Faith in like God? In our identity, our principles, the DNA of European nations. And when it comes down to fight for that identity, where will you be? Will you fight for it? Yeah. Good man. I'm eyeing these chili fries. - Hello. - Mrs. Palicki? Who's this? -This is Shirley from Valley Credit Union calling on behalf of the fraud department. - What? - Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. Can you please verify a recent check? Well, who was it made out to? William and Candice McKenny. Says here computer help. Well, thank you, thank you very much for telling me. Did you authorize the check? - Goodbye. - Mrs. Palicki? Hey, you, eat trash. I'm sorry, what? You nasty thrifter whore! What the fuck is wrong with you? What did he pay you for? Calm the fuck down, lady. What did he pay you for? I don't know what you're talking about. My son, Ronnie, what did he pay you for? What did he pay you for? You nasty whore! Ronnie, come back to me. Ronnie, Ronnie... Next stop, Fullerton. Arrival in ten minutes. I need you. Do you like me? You said it was for your VIP members. You could've blurred out my face. Drop it, you got paid. You fucking lied to me. What do you want from us? I... I want you. In exchange for the videos I want you to fuck me the way that I want. No. You did it before. I was high, I needed you to keep making the videos, that's all. But you fuck any type of guys, fucking niggers and spics. I fuck who I want! And in case you haven't noticed, you're not exactly my type. You fucked me! And you're a fucking escort, you advertise. I can get you money. I will never fuck you, cuck. Cuck, I'm not a cuck. Sure you are. What kind of a real man takes it between the eyes? Why are you being a bitch to me? Just stop being a fucking bitch. Piece of shit. I feel like I've been stabbed! And you have every right to feel that way. Momma, it's okay. You worthless little piece of shit! - Stop. - I didn't raise a thief. You never had any job, I didn't raise a liar! Okay, okay, okay. You're okay. Sit, sit down. Ronnie, did you write the checks? - Yes. - Can you tell me what for? Go sit in jail, you stupid little thief! Stealing from your mother like some beggar, is that what you are? You're not my son, go rot in there like some smut whore! Small in the eyes of God! Not my son, not my son! Thanks for the ride, I'll pay you back. No, no don't worry about it. You don't belong in a place like that. You're going to be all right, Ronnie. You going to be all right. Whatever comes you just take it like a man. You're going to get knocked down and you're going to get knocked down again and you just keep getting up and keep swinging. - Alright? - Yeah. - You all right? - Yeah, thanks. See you around. I'm sorry, momma. - They let you out? - Yeah. Baby, baby, I've been so worried. Oh, you can't keep doing this. You've got to be good, you've got to be good, Ronnie, please. You're probably starving, huh? You need your mom better make you some food. Get you something to eat. Here, come with me. See that's what a real man looks like. I could never stay married to a man with a dick that small. But I thought you liked the car that I bought you. Look at that pathetic little thing. You're so sad, you're such a pathetic little man. Oh yes, oh! I sometimes highlight the people who mistakenly consider themselves our peers. The shitlord you're about to see, he stalked me at the convention just this past weekend. He called himself a true patriot. Well, ladies and gentleman, let me introduce you to TruePatriot89, otherwise known as Candy's Cuck. That's how a real cock looks. Get it up, can you get it up? Hey, little buddy. How do you like this dick? Ronnie, oh yeah right in his face. Where do these losers come from? Is this a mole trying to weaken our force? Maybe the virtue signaling left will accept this kind of behavior, but we won't. He's a nutcase and a definitive cuck. In every sense of the word. Ronnie, Ronnie stop! Stop! I'm going to phone Dixon, now you're going to get it! Your father would be ashamed! - Hello. - Candy? It doesn't need to be like this. What the hell do you want? Just listen to me, I... I really like you. And I really want to be with you. And me and you can just get out of town. Just leave together, Bill doesn't love you. You can't possibly love him, he's using you and he's a pimp and an asshole. I'm a really nice guy and I just want you to... I just want you to give me a chance. I'm going to give you a chance, okay? And I suggest that you take it. - Bill. - Candy. Candy? What the fuck, Ronnie? Who's the cuck now? Ronnie no, no! No! Fuck! Stop! What the fuck? What the fuck is this? Ronnie. We're closed! Reza! Ronnie, what are you doing? You don't have to... Ronnie, please don't kill my son, Ronnie. Ronnie, please don't shoot! Ronnie, don't shoot! Come out with your hands up! Come out now! Get down! So I wanted to shoot this video update for the die-hards who watch my channel. I haven't really talked about myself too much on here. But I wanted to share what's going on with me. Last night I had the opportunity to meet one of my personal heroes. Hello, Chance. I never thought that he would actually take the time to get to know me, but he did and for the first time I feel like someone's actually listening to me. And all of you, all you patriots who keep subscribing, guys, that means the world to me. Thank you. I feel like I could do anything and like we are going to change the world, you know. I mean, man, this year has been like the best. I've learned that in life you got to go after what you want and you can't let anyone tell you what you can or what you can't do. You just go for it. There's one more thing. I uh... I got a sweet lady in my life right now. And she sees me for me, and... I can see that she needs me. And you know, maybe I need her too. 'Cause love hasn't always been an easy thing for me. But... but... I'm trusting myself that maybe she is the one. So wish me luck guys, kay? And I also hope things are good for you out there too. Stay strong, patriots. Go catch some waves.
