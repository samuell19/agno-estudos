Subtitles by explosiveskull No! I know you're coming. And I'll be waiting. So, being two decades on, you finally know the truth about your parents. Yeah. I mean like, I know it wasn't a scarecrow. I don't even know how I thought that even just for a minute. It's not uncommon for people that experience traumatic things to go into their psyche and create a fantasy to be able to cope with it. You were six years old, you watched your parents being brutally slain in your own home. You know, that's quite awful to have to deal with. So putting a mask on the identity of the killer is, is quite a normal thing that people do in those, in those circumstances. I just now think that it's time for you to move forward now, which I think you have. Yeah. I mean, I just wanna know who it was. You know, like I can't get it out of my head. Do you still have access to the family home? Yep. And who lives there now? My brother Carl. I don't think he ever moved on. I think maybe you should go back there. How do you feel about that? No, I couldn't. If you're over this trauma, and I thought that we'd dealt with it. We have dealt with it. See, you just said we. It's not we June, this is your journey. Only you are responsible, and can take the action into your recovery. I can only take you so far. But it's down to you. You're right. So what do you suggest? I think you should call your brother. And what's this in aid of? Hey Carl, it's nice to hear your voice. You too, sis. Last time was what? Christmas? I know, I'm so sorry. I've been terrible. But I wanted to let you know that, um, I'm gonna come and see you, tomorrow. No, you're not to come here. You know you're not to come here. Carl, come on, I mean it's been 20 years, I wanna be with you tomorrow. And I wanna remember the good things, not just how it ended. It's been 20 years, and he will rise again. Carl, I thought we were past this. It wasn't a scarecrow, it was probably a burglary gone wrong or something. We really have to face the truth, we're not kids anymore. I am, and it's about time you did, too. I knew you'd come back. Carl? Carl, I'm coming tomorrow, okay? I don't care what you say. I wanna be with you, I wanna hang out with you. It's not safe for you here. I've got to go. Carl? Come on! Come on! Show yourself! I see you. Come on! No, you don't have to come with me. Stop, I've been through it all with you so far, so. Come on, when? Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? Yeah. I've gotta fix my hair but, should be all right. Stop it, you dork. You don't have to have your hair done for the farm. Why not? You dunno who could be there. Give me a minute. June speaking. I can't believe it. I can't believe he's dead. Well, they said it was suicide, do you believe there's any reason to think that it was anything else? Well, they determined suicide, but they found him strung up in the barn. June! I've just heard, I am so sorry. Oh, bless you. You'll get through this, all right? We're gonna get through this together, - all right? - Thank you. All right. Oh according to this, we should of gone left way back there. Jesus Christ, this place is in the middle of nowhere! Oh wait, pull over, pull over. Ask that lady over there, she might know where we are. Hi. Hey, hey love, are you able to help us? Yeah, what's up? We're just looking for directions for the Old Creek Manor. Old Creek Manor? Why do you wanna go to that place? No one's been there in years. The man that lives there. Yeah, he got killed honey, last night. Yeah, we know. Are you able to just give us directions to the manor? Right, you know some crazy shit went on there, right? People won't go out of these woods, that's why you probably won't see any road signs but. They say that the urban legends are real, the scarecrow actually kills people. You know what happened there - about 20 years ago, right? - Yeah, and do you know the way? Like I said, honey, you're not gonna find any road signs. People don't go out that far since the murders, but, keep going straight, right? Straight through those woods. Hit left, then, you won't miss it, all right? Thank you. But I can't advice you enough. Stay away from those woods for your own safety, all right? You okay? Just ignore her. Crazy lady. June? Yeah, I'm fine. That's why I moved from here. All these stupid legends the locals make up. Don't listen to her. Right where he always left them. They're his. Sorry. It's okay, that's why we're here. We've gotta clean the place up. It's been a long day. Why don't we all just get some rest, yeah? Sure. And, if you need anything, you know where I am. - All right. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Karen. Do you wanna? I'm not tired yet. Come on. 20 years, huh? Yeah, it's been 20 years since I've been here. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Chanel, I don't think it's a good idea us being out here. John, stop, it's fucking cool, okay? Some guys kills himself and you think being on his land is cool? Well, you know the truth about this land right? I don't wanna hear about no urban legends. Come on, just hear me out, please. Right, this crazy bitch. What about it? Well, legend says that the scarecrow is on this land, right? And his spirit remains on the field waiting to walk again. The catch with that, is that a scarecrow is created to ward off crows. True, but the truth also is that on this land, centuries ago, there was a man left out to die here. And apparently the locals caught him stealing, and they found him doing all sorts of fucked up shit with animals. So they just hung him up and let the crows get him. Yeah, okay. Fine, don't believe me, but it is real. And his spirit does remain here. Okay, you know what? Follow me, come on. You want proof? Not really. Come on, come on. Come on. Look, I know. With everything that's happened to you in the past, with your parents, you know it must be so hard. And I can only comprehend like a little bit but I know that you must be feeling so alone sometimes and I just want you to know that I'm there for you. Thank you. You don't have to thank me, we're like family now. I'm not going anywhere. If you need me I'm just across the doorway. Thank you so much. Don't thank me. Night. Goodnight. Hold on. Got it. Wow. Oh fuck, they cleaned it. What? Oh no, that suicide guy, he put some weird shit on the wall about the scarecrow that I wanted to show you. Oh, right, well, shall we go then? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, stay. Why? Oh, if the scarecrow turns up, that would be rather cool. I don't think there's anything thrilling about a cold and creepy barn. Don't you think it would be hot if we make love in here? Oh god, what are you doing? Come on. Don't you think that if the scarecrow guy was here that he'd show me a good time? Oh, well he can have you and I'll go safely. Come on now, seriously. But I'm horny. Look, so am I but I don't wanna do this. Oh, what are you doing? Come on. Come on. Oh my god, stop. Oh, fuck it. I told you it'd be a thrill. What the fuck are you on about? We need to go right now. It's probably the scarecrow, shall we go find him? What do you think? No. Let's do it. Come on. Chanel, we need to leave. I'm gonna go find the scarecrow. No. Chanel! Come out, come out, wherever you are. Chanel? Oh god. Oh, not the button. Come on. Chanel? What? My light's not working. Then turn it on, then. I'm trying. Stop being a little bitch, all right? Can't. Shut up. Chanel, my light's not working. Fine, I'm gonna try and turn the light on, all right? Chanel? Ow, ow. June? Girls? Girls, the light's gone out. June? June? Oh, June, hi. Um sorry, I. Nancy said it would be a good idea to start packing things, but maybe it's too soon? No. No, it's fine, that's why we're here. Wow, it must be a bit weird seeing me with all your possessions. Honestly it's fine. You all right? I just feel like I'm leaving them behind. Yeah. I can understand that, but it's really good you know, for your progress. Getting rid of everything, clearing out the past. It's probably what you need to really move forward. You're never leaving them behind. You know, if you ever want them near you, your family, all you have to do is close your eyes and imagine that they're there in your mind, that you can see them. And if you do that, they're with you, you can feel them. I know that when my mother died, god rest her soul. That's what I used to do, and still do, to keep her close to me. I close my eyes and I imagine that she's there. And she is, she really is. You wanna give it a go? Wow, my brother really was a hoarder, wasn't he? Well, I wasn't going to say anything but you really shoulda probably binned all this stuff years ago. Do you know what this is? It's a necklace? No, it's a pendant and I can use it to hypnotize you. Oh, Karen. Well, if you don't want to, I won't, but hear me out. There's a reason why people use hypnosis, it's because it works. Sorry. Keep going. There's something wrong in your mind, there's something in there that's trapped in your memories. This is a way that I can go in and talk to your psyche. Get right inside there and unlock whatever that trauma is that's holding you back. It's perfectly safe. We can stop anytime you want. I've got a really good feeling this is gonna really help you with your recovery. Do you think it'll work? I know it'll work. Why don't we just give it a go? It's not gonna harm you, we can stop at any time. You're not in any danger. I just think we should give it a go. Okay, let's give it a go. Okay. Sorry, am I interrupting something? And what is up with this fucked up lighting, girls? Listen to my words. Listen to my voice as it washes over you. Feel your eyes as they start to get very heavy. You're falling deeper. And deeper. And deeper. And on the count of three. One, two, three. You're out. June, where are you? I'm in the barn. And who's with you, June? My brother. What are you doing in the barn? I'm looking out the window. Tell me what can you see? My mom. She's telling me not to come out. She's telling me to stay in here, it's dangerous out there, I'm scared. He's bleeding. Who's bleeding? And my dad, he's there. She's gone to get the keys, and my dad's there. He's bleeding. He's cut. He's got a cut on him. He's bleeding, and my mom, she's telling me not to come out. Who else is there, June? Tell me who else is there. Oh, he's there! - Tell me what he looks like. - He's there, he's there. Who is he, June? I can hear the bell. There's a bell, I can hear it. Who is it? It's a scarecrow. He's there, he's coming for me. - It's not a scarecrow, June. - He's coming for me. - Who is he? - He's coming for me. - Tell me who it is. - He's coming for me, he's coming, he's coming, he's going to kill me, it's him. All right, June, - snap out of it now. - He's here. Scarecrow, it's a scarecrow! It's a scarecrow. Wake her up. Why is she not waking up? It's a scarecrow, it's a scarecrow! June, snap out of it now, June. Back here, June. June? It's all right. You all right? Okay? Yeah. Who was it? Who was it? Who did I see? You can say it. Say what? You think I'm crazy. I don't think you're crazy. I just told you the guy that killed my parents is a fucking scarecrow. Doesn't get much more fucked up than that. I think you're being too hard on yourself. You had a really traumatic time as a child and your brain just doesn't want you to relive that and who would? I just wanna remember. I want justice. Flying rats with wings. I hate crows. It's like they heard me. I think something scared them. Right. Show me where you grew up. Okay. Excuse me, can I help you? Who are you? Sorry, who are you? Where's Carl? Carl Summers? Oh. You haven't heard. Heard? I'm sorry, but Carl died. Died? Yeah, suicide. Sorry to hear that. Look, I'm Dean Rodge from Cannings Farm just up the road. My niece, Chanel, someone said that they seen her up here last night. You seen her? No. No, I'm staying here with Carl's sister and her friend. We're here on our own. There's no one else here. Redhead, American. You seen her? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I have seen her. Yesterday, she. She was along the track. She pointed us in the right direction of how to get here. We asked her for directions. So she was here? No, she wasn't here. She was over there. When was this? Midday? No. Last night they said they seen her. Last night, when she was up here walking with her... No, no. No one was here last night. Look, I'm just up the road. If you see her you call me, all right? I'm getting worried. Okay, bye. How hippy was she with this? She must be old. I just call it vintage. Old but gold. Your brother ain't playing. So you think you're definitely gonna sell the place then? Yeah. I guess I don't really have an option with the memories and everything. I don't wanna be here, so yeah. I reckon you could make a good buck for it, though. Look at this. Shit. The mystery of the 1978 killings is still gripping the village. Children claim to have seen sightings of scarecrows moving in the area. No one knows what or where these rumors started from but there are rumors that the scarecrow activity has seen as far as Cheshunt. The makings of an urban legend are with the rumors although each apparent sighting of the murders has a slightly different look to it. The 1958 murders at the Old Manor blamed on scarecrows. So, your parents bought the manor knowing that the murders had happened. Yeah, but, it keeps happening on the land. Yeah, but it's like a house in the middle of nowhere. Of course there's gonna be unexplained killings. Every 20 years? No, I just think your brother would say anything just to make his story viable. Dunno. Look, I've got something to show you. Come with me. Where are you taking me? I've got something to show you. Come on. Come on. No, not interested at all. It's just a scarecrow. I'm good here. It's just a dummy. Look. It's a dummy. Come on. I'm all right. Come on, look, it's good - for you to touch it. - I'm okay! I promise. It's just made of hay. Come on, touch it, come on. Okay. Yep, yep, all good. Got it, cool. - It's hay. - June. I believe you. Come on, it's time to face your fears. Come on. Come on. It's for the birds. I believe you. Good! Let's go. Come on. As your friend right now, do it. Oh god. Okay. Yep. All righty. See, I trusted you. Get outta here! Oh my god, these dates. It happens every 20 years. Couldn't sleep? Was that you? What? The bell? No. What bell? Don't worry about it. I've got a sneaky bottle of wine in my case. Do you want to come and join me for a drink? Sure. I mean, I like. There is so much stuff written about it all. I don't understand how it wouldn't make sense. It doesn't make sense for it not. Why would people keep writing about this stuff? I don't want you to think that I'm crazy. Actually, don't worry about it. June, you don't think that all the years I've been doing this that I've heard far crazier stories than the things that you're saying? Why don't you just tell me what it is. I found these sketches that my brother saved. And it triggered some kind of memory? They're of the scarecrow. Look. Doesn't it look familiar? Well. They're exactly the same. Perhaps, but. They match. Yes, but that could just be a coincidence. A coi-, a coincidence that every 20 years someone on this land dies or gets murdered or? Like. Don't tell me that you came back here to just try and find this scarecrow. Look. I just feel like there is. How can it. There's so much stuff. I don't think it was a good idea you coming back here and I think I've misled you somehow. I think you made so much progress and being here has just like sent you back a bit. You being back here, I don't think it's helped. You were making so much progress and now I feel that it's just pushed you backwards. This sketch of the scarecrow, it is exactly what I remember. June. All scarecrows look alike. You must think that I'm crazy. June, I don't think you're crazy, but I think your brother being here, it's stopped him being able to move forwards and I think that you coming back here seriously has hampered your progression in your recovery. I think I've mislead you. I don't think we should've come back here... Listen to this. "It's said that a scarecrow returns each 20 years "after a terrible crime which took place in the 1800s "where a man was brutally strung up by the locals "in the fields of Belgrave. "A man died, cursing the town to rise again "which he later then did two decades later. "Murders on the land, sightings of a scarecrow. "No way to stop it, but the two days in which it stalks "the lands to allow his soul to roam." I mean, I think that's why my brother was staying here. He wanted to get it once and for all. This is real. So you're trying' to tell me that the two days that the scarecrow rises are now? Really? My parents were murdered 20 years ago today. So. Right, that's it. I've had enough. Come on, you're coming with me. I've got an idea. Come. Right, June, come with me. Come on. I know exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna fix you. Karen. You need to face your fears. Take a look at this. What do you see? Karen, I don't want to. What do you see? A scarecrow, yeah? A scarecrow. Nothing alive about it. There's nothing there that's gonna hurt you. It's not dangerous. It's just a big lump of straw, that's it. Do you get it now? Do you get it in your head? I don't like this at all, Karen. All right, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna unmask your killer. Let's unmask him and see what he looks like. Hey guys, what are you guys doing out so late? I'm trying to show June that the scarecrow, this fear that she has for him, is totally unfounded. It's just something, a figment of her imagination. It's got to stop. There is nothing scary about this. There's not. It's not real. I know what we'll do. We'll unmask the killer. Are you ready? Let's see what is behind the mask once and for all. On the count of three. One. Two. Three! Oh my god! It's. It's that girl. What's that? What? Who's there? Show yourself! Somebody's messing about with us. I see what we're gonna do. We can all go back and still run for it. All right? - Okay. - Yes. On the count of three. One. Two. Three! Run, run run! What the hell just happened? Come on, Karen, you saw it with your eyes. I don't know what I saw. It was just an animal or something. It wasn't an animal. An animal? Oh my god. My brother was right, this land is cursed. Please tell me you saw what I saw. Well, whatever it was we need to get hell out of here. Does anyone have a mobile phone or anything? Mobile phone? No one's got any signal anywhere out here, anyway. Okay, well go. Go go go. Fuck. Fucking phone's out. I don't know what we're gonna do. I gotta think. Think, think, think. I got it. Tell you what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go and the car, I'm gonna drive to the next town, there's gotta be one nearby. I'm gonna raise the alarm, get them to come back and send help for you. Back? No, you're not going out there on your own with that thing there. No. Don't know what the fuck else to do, June. We can't just sit here and wait for it to come and get us. That thing. Thing? Thing? You saw it, didn't you? Please tell me that you saw it. Yeah. Yeah. So my brother was right. The curse of the scarecrow, it's real. Yeah, it's real. What are we gonna do? I don't know. But I tell you what, I'm not gonna sit here and wait for that thing to come back. We're gonna fight it, we're gonna stay up all night, we're gonna survive. We just have to survive the night. I need to show you something. We have to clean that thing up, come on. Oh god. Ah. I need some tissue. Ah. It's fine. Ow. I've got something to show you. Okay, there has to be something here. There's gotta be something in here, there has to be something in here. Otherwise why would he keep them? Okay, so this all the stuff my brother kept. All they say it. What is this? It's all his research, but, there's gotta be something in here for it to tie in. But these dates, they go back for years. They're the same. They go back hundreds of years. Every 20 years people go missing, they die. They disappear. Or they say that they've seen. That they've seen it. The scarecrow. Look. It's not a coincidence, it can't be. It can't be. But these are in all different areas. It's everywhere. There could be hundreds of them. Oh my god. June, all of these people. You think there's more of them out there? June, I don't know what the fuck to believe anymore. It's okay, it's fine, I understand. Have you seen him? Have you seen anything? No, nothing. I can't stay here, I'm gonna go and get some help. What, no you're not going. I've worked it out. I'm gonna go over there to your car, I'm gonna drive to the next village, I'm gonna raise the alarm and then I'm gonna come back and rescue you two. All right? Then we're coming with you. Oh, no you're not. You stay here where you're safe. All right, wish me luck. - Karen. - Karen, Karen. Karen, be careful. Come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Why isn't she going? Karen, behind you! Karen, run! What? I dunno, stab him in the hay? - I just... - What? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I just thought it was an urban legend. No, it's okay, it's okay. I would never of believed me either. We really shouldn't of let Karen run out there on her own. Come on. What do we do? What? The gun. A gun? I found it in your brother's barn. Okay. A gun. Yeah, the gun in your brother's barn. I'll be quick. Nancy, are you serious? No fucking way. Listen. I'm gonna go. It's not happening. You're not going. - And if you hear anything - No. And I mean anything, you shout as loud as you can. You just saw what happened to Karen. It is out there, it is alive. You're not going. No, I can't lose you, too. You won't, I promise. I've got a weapon. I'm gonna upgrade this bitch. Besides, they set after Karen anyway. June? June, I've dropped the knife! Help me! Help me! Oh, thank god. Can you try to help me? You're the woman from the Summers' place. What is it, what's going on? You will never believe me. If any of us still smoked, I woulda set fire to you, you bag of shit. It's the curse of the scarecrow. What, you know about this? We all do, everyone in the town knows the legend. It's real? It is. Hey, where are you taking me? I told you to take me where there's a phone. We're going backwards. We're going the way to the farm. Hey. I said where are you taking me? Take me back there! I am. Stop the car! Stop the car now! I'm getting out. Let me get out. Nancy. Where are you? Nancy. Nance? Nancy? June! June! June! This man, this man is a local. He was supposed to take me for help but he's brought me back here. Oh god. Don't fucking move. What's going on? It's got my niece. Where is she? Your niece, oh. She's dead. He killed her. Where is she? She's dead. We found her body. Mister. We've gotta get out of here, okay? We've gotta get out of here. He can't be stopped. We can't stop them until the sun rises. What do you mean? This won't be over until the 48 hour reign is finished. We've got two hours till sunrise. This is the curse of the scarecrow. Behind you. He's behind you. Karen. June, run. Run! Wait. Karen, he's coming. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, please, no, no, please. Please, I am just like you, okay? I am just like you. I know what happened with the locals. Okay. I know what happened with the locals many many many years ago. I know they strung you out and they starved you, okay? I know all about that, okay? Okay. I am just like you. I'm exactly like you. I would never, I would never do that, okay? I know that they starved you. I know that they tortured you. That you didn't eat anything, so I understand. Okay, I'm so sorry. Okay. I am so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry that happened to you. I am so sorry, I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Okay. Karen! Are you okay? Where there's smoke, there's fire. How you feeling' now? Now that it's all done, it's all over. No one's gonna believe us. No one has to. So what do we do? We just wait for the next 20 years and he's gonna come back? Yeah. We'll be ready for them then. Are you all right? Yeah. Can you wait one minute? June! The souls of the victims are trapped. They are cursed to suffer the same fate as the scarecrow. Oh my god. There are more of them. June! Karen. June! No! No! Subtitles by explosiveskull
