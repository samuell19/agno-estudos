-Come on! Come on! Get your butt in here. -Let's get the hell out of here! -All right, let's go up. Man down there. There's a man down there! Put it down! -[SCREAMS] -You keep firing. Cover me! [CROWD CHEERING] [HELICOPTER WINGS] [CROWD CHEERING] [HELICOPTER WINGS] [CROWD CHEERING] [HELICOPTER WINGS] [MUSIC PLAYING] --[INAUDIBLE], what's happening you old rascal? Good to see ya. -How you doing, Eddie? -I'm here. -I guess they didn't find out about your police record, huh? [BOTH LAUGH] -Hold my calls, OK Donna? Come on in, Jimmy. Not bad, huh? -Not bad at all. --[CHUCKLES] What'll you have, Jimmy? -You got any beer in there, hotshot? -I got everything. -I'll take a beer. -One day I'm here and already it hits the fan. You know that kid Carver? The one they signed for Penn State? -Sure, the fullback. -Right. Well, to celebrate his signing, we take him out to dinner last night. [INAUDIBLE] Nice place. Halfway through dinner, Lansky and Meyer stop by the table, welcome the kid, the whole shot. Just before they get ready to leave, what do you think they tell the kid? "Hey, what kind of car they get ya?" Just to break my stones, right? And I assume the kid knows they're screwing around, right? -Right. -8 o'clock this morning I get a phone call from his attorney. And he wants to know when the car's being delivered. Do you know that took me all morning to straighten that mess out? --[LAUGHS] I guess you didn't get a chance to talk to the main man then, huh? -Jim, I already took care of that. It's in the bag. The only thing we have to discuss is a start date for you. -Eddie, doesn't training camp start next week? -That's right. They start on the seventh. -I'd probably be most effective working with receivers. But whatever. I mean, even linemen. -Jim, there's no question we all consider you a valuable asset to this team. But what we have in mind is more of a-- well, [INAUDIBLE]. You'll be looking at films to analyze. But, uh-- -But what? -Heck, we haven't even figured out a title yet. You're going to be doing a lot of things, scouting, public relations. You're gonna like the salary, Jim. Not only that, they have a complete medical package that's probably the best in the country. -What about coaching? -I'm afraid that's just not in the cards, Jim? -Why? I want to know why. O'Bradovich, we talked about coaching! Now, I want to know why! -They, uh-- I-- they don't think you can cut it. -You can't even say it. You know that's a lie. Now what is it? Am I gonna make some of the players a little uncomfortable? Is that it? -Is that so unreasonable? The way the game's played today, it's a real concern to our players that they could wind up, well, hurt. And hurt bad. It doesn't do any good for them to constantly be reminded of it. -Blinders for everyone. Is that it? What does that have to do with coaching? -It's bad for business. Jimmy, you and I both know that's the bottom line. We're running a major corporation here. You ought to be thankful they're offering you any kind of job at all. [SIGHS] Jimmy. We've been friends a long time. Please. Take the weekend. Think about it. -I already have. You can take your PR job and shove it. Thanks for the beer, O'Bradovich. [MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN ON TV: Have to tell the police sooner or later. I didn't come here for a lecture, April. Tom is innocent. -Did you tell Andy I wanted him home before I leave for work? -Since when is Andy ever home before you leave for work? --[SIGHS] Well, when do you start? The job, when do you start? -I don't start. I turned it down. -The Chicago Bears offered you a job and you turned it down. What were all the letters and phone calls for? -They offered me a public relations job. I'm a football player. I don't know the first thing about public relations work. -They offered you a job, didn't they? -You know what? You should worry less about me and more about that kid of yours. -Look. As soon as Andy is through with school this year, I'm getting a place of my own. -Good. I'll help you move. I find it interesting, though, that when your old man walked out on you and you weren't working and my VA check was paying for everything, you weren't talking about moving out then. -Look, we didn't get along when we were kids, and we still don't. I thought at least you and Andy would hit it off-- -No, that isn't what you thought. You thought I'd take care of him. That is what you thought. So you could recapture your teenage years. But now you've got a son, and he's holding you back. And guess what? I don't blame ya. -Look, why can't you take care of him? You got something better to with your life? Why can't you give a little? -Give a little? How much do you want me to give? How about these? How much do you want me to give? [DOORBELL RINGS] -Mrs. DeFalco? -Yes? -I'm with the Juvenile Division. Are you Andrew DeFalco's mother? -Is he all right? -No, we have him in custody downtown at the Juvenile Detention Center. He was arrested for armed robbery. -Oh my god. I tried to contact your father. -I won't hold my breath waiting for him. -I don't even know what to tell him. -Tell him I'm sorry I didn't get away with it. -How can you do this to me again? -Mrs. DeFalco, your attorney is here. -I read the arresting officer's report. Not an easy situation to deal with. -Mr. Reisman, when do think my nephew will be released? -He's not going to be released. The boy's got priors. He's already in violation of his probation. They might want to try them as an adult. -They can't! -We'll try not to let that happen. -But we're still looking at a major felony in which a gun was used. And that plus the boy's prior arrest usually means time in a state Correctional Institution. -There are other alternatives. A lot depends on the judge. Now, given the right circumstances, the judge might be persuaded to release him into your custody again. -Are you working, Mrs. DeFalco? -I-- I'm an airline passenger rep. -Well, frankly the boy's chances of being released in your custody would be greater if you weren't working, for a little while anyway. -I can't afford not to work. MR. REISMAN: You have to look at this from the judge's point of view. -The judge's point of view? It's my life too! Where do I come in? -We'll do everything we can. -We can work this out. -I don't want your help. I don't want to work it out. I want the state to take care of him, to have custody of him. I want them to. I can't handle him anymore, OK? I can't handle him! Do you understand me? I just can't do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOGS BARKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PRISONERS SHOUTING] -Quite a rap sheet you got here. You're cute, all right. But you know something? As of a few minutes ago, you just turned over a new leaf. 'Cause the only person that makes trouble in this joint is me. Everything seems to be in order. We have a bunk for him in J Ward. -Before you put this boy in Population, make sure he doesn't have any rifles or hand grenades on him. -Come with me. Right over there. [LAUGHS] Take your clothes off. -What for? -You heard the man. Gonna search ya. -They did that over at Juvenile. -Not the way we do it. This is different. This is what we call a cavity search. This is it, Sweet Pea. -My name is Andy! -Whatever you say, Sweet Pea. Now, you just make up your bunk real nice. Because I'm going to be back to check in on ya in a little while. -Some dump, huh? That was McLeash. We call him The Mouth. Got to watch him, Jack. -Really? And here I was thinking he was a nice guy. -You're from Juvy Hall, right? Yeah, I can tell, man, you're from Juvy. Well let me tell you something, Jack. That place is Disneyland compared to this hole. In this place you do hard time. And I mean hard time. -I thought visiting day was Sunday. -After today it is. This is part of your orientation. -Just like the first day of school. -Well, you know, there are papers to be signed, things like that. -So did you sign me in? -Andy. I know I never gave you much of my time. But I really think I know how you feel right now. -You want to do something for me? -Sure. -Well, get me out of this dump. -I can't. That's something you've gotta do for yourself. -Just leave me alone. You never gave a damn about me when I was home. So what do you say we just leave it like that. And don't tell me. Let me guess. She couldn't make it 'cause she had to work. [SHOUTING] -Ready, set! Get that. Come on, come on! Let's go. Come on, get back. Let's get it right this time. Break! Let's go! Ready, set, hut one, hut two, hut! Just rest a minute. I'll be right back. -Play much ball? -Nah. Nah, I played baseball in college. Never really got into football. I'm just filling in. -Those boys keep hitting like that, they're going to get hurt. Know what to do, if you don't mind me telling ya? Should have them get under the opponent, hit like this. Keep the elbows in. Otherwise they're going to dislocate their shoulders. -Hey, thanks. -OK. COACH: Hey you guys, come in here a minute! -You want the job? -No thanks. I want to coach, but not here. -Are you here to see your nephew? -Yeah. You? -I do counseling here. -It do any good? -Sometimes. How'd it go with your nephew. -Didn't. -Hey, I wasn't kidding about that coaching job. If you didn't want to take it permanently, you could take the six-week temporary assignmnt. I've got a friend who's on the supervisory board, and I'm sure if you told him you wanted the job-- -But I don't. -I could give it a push from my end as well. My boss does the hiring. -Don't push, lady. Look, my nephew may be a part of your caseload, but I'm not. EDDIE: Whatever you want, sweetheart. Want to bet your house, your car? I can handle that too. I'm always here. Don't worry. Just make sure I haven't got to come and find you, OK? Later. Hey, Jim, I've been waiting for you. Hey, get this guy a vodka and tonic, and bring me another one, too. And hold my calls. -What are you so cheerful about? -Cheerful? Two of my customers caught the double at Arlington today. It was a big one. And both of the bums had a 50 on it. Don't talk to me about being cheerful. So what happened? -They backed out. They offered me a job in the public relations department. -Good money? -What do I know about public relations? I'm a coach! It's give the vet a break time. They jerked me around, Eddie. -Listen, how do you think I feel? I go out, order a new Caddy and the Cubs [INAUDIBLE] all this inside information you're going to get me. You cost me, man. --[CHUCKLES] I thought it was gonna be different this time. I really did. -You can't expect this kind of thing from these able-bodied dummies. You know that. -Aw, please. Come on, Eddie. You sound like some VA consult. What am I supposed to do, accept it? -No. You keep swinging. Hey, you know what we can do? We can go up to the vets hospital. We'll get some of the guys together. We're go through a picket line around this place. When you see it, you'll call it gimpdemania. -[LAUGHS] Gimpdemania, huh? -That's not the only team, you know. -This was my shot. -There'll be other shots. -Yeah, sure. -Like St. Charles Correctional. Know what they did? They offered me a job as athletic director. -Babysitting for a bunch of juvenile delinquents. Who needs that? -I may be in a chair. But I'm still a man, and I want to be treated like a man. -Listen, pal, the hell with them. Stay home. They did this to you. Let the government take care of you. Let 'em pay! -Yeah. -The temporary athletic director, he's here. -I forgot all about that. Well, he's probably [INAUDIBLE] nephew. I hope this one's not some child molester. -He's, uh-- he's in a wheelchair. -What they trying to do to me? Well, Mr. Brandon. Haven't I seen you here before? -Probably. My nephew is one of your students, Andy DeFalco. -Oh, yeah. I'm afraid there's been some mix-up up about this job. -You mean the job's been filled already? -I don't know what they sent you down here for, but the only job I have open is that of temporary athletic director. It's not an office job. -Athletic director's the job I applied for. -Well, it's not going to work out. You see, I'm-- I'm very short on staff and I-- I don't have the time to train you. -I'm not asking you to train me. No, let me rephrase that. I'm not asking you to do anything special for me, Mr. Turner. -You're not? Well, you've got to understand. This is not some Sesame Street playground we're running here. -I understand what we're talking about. I took special education courses in college. MR. TURNER: You think that means anything to these kids here? Uh-uh. The only way you're going to gain their respect is if you're capable of dropping them in their tracks. -I thought we were out of the dark ages a long time ago. -Mr. Turner, you should know what we're dealing with here because of Andy. Before a kid makes a state institution like this, he's already been arrested 10 or 12 times. And that's not for shoplifting, either. When you're alone with these kids, you're in physical danger! -So is everyone else. If that's what it is, then that's what it is. -You take on these kids, you're asking for trouble! -You're wrong. I already have trouble. And the only thing that makes it worse is people making more of me being in this wheelchair than is really necessary. -I'm just not getting through to you, am I? -I'm afraid you're a little late. You see, I didn't want this job. But now I'm committed to it for six weeks. Goodbye, Mr. Turner. -Man! -Oh, come on, man! [ARGUING AND SHOUTING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] -Throw me the football! [ARGUING AND SHOUTING] -Hut one. Hut two. -I got it now! Hey, what's happening? Thought you were gonna throw it to me, man! -You ready to play some football? -Little late, aren't ya? You supposed to be Joe Volunteer or something? -I'm on the payroll. I'm your athletic director. -Well that's going to work out just right. 'Cause as far as I'm concerned-- -Give me the ball! ---you're no different from the rest of the creeps the run this place. -I said give me the ball, man. -I don't see your name on it. -Well, I'll show it to you! [CROWD YELLING] -Break it up! Break it up! Break it up! -You two just earned yourself some room time. Get out of here! First you've got to get their attention. -That's all right, Sweetlife. You got the best of him. [SOUNDS OF PLAYING PING PONG] --[INAUDIBLE] never played no game before. -That's the ace on you. [INAUDIBLE] Here's your queen. And I'm out, suckers. Count 'em up. What you got, man? You better give it up. 35-- -I want in. --[LAUGHS] Better deal this child in or he'll tell his uncle. He here to take care of you? -I take care of myself, sweetheart. -I can dig it. Sure wish my uncle worked here. Give me some weekend passes, he bring me some reefer, you know what I mean. He tuck you in at night? [WHISTLE BLOWING] -What's going on here? -The table fell. -Peanut, what are you doing back here? -Grand theft auto. -You can hardly see over the steering wheel. -I had a partner. I steered, and he worked the pedals. I mean, we was a team! Until they nailed us. -How you doing, Andy? -He's got his uncle here to take care of him. That's how he's doing. -And you wonder why you get into fights all the time. -Look, baby, I'm just telling you like it is. -All right, folks, who we playing? Who want in? -You can't fight the whole world, Sweetlife. Don't you know that? -I get the rages to take care of him and his uncle. -You've already lost a lot of privileges. Now who's the loser? -The loser's the one who don't get up off the floor. -What if it's you? -Well then, that's one more dead nigger in this world. And that won't make much more of a difference, will it? -I know you don't mean that. -I don't? Well look, baby. I started out long time ago as a loser. You know what I am? I'm a seven-letter word, mistake. -Let's get right down to it, all right? -You want to get down? -Let's keep it on quiet, gentlemen. You get in, take your shower, and get out. It's not a swimming pool. Anybody who doesn't wash his hair sees the barber. -Hey coach! You gonna give me some booty after a while? How 'bout it? We got some unfinished business. You got to show some respect, bro. So how 'bout you make up my bed right now? -How about you take the pipe? [CROWD SHOUTING] -You had enough, nigger? 'Cause if you have, it's over for now. -No, man. Let me tell you something, nigger. It ain't over. Sometime you're gonna have to sleep. And when you do, I'm gonna bury my shoe in your face. -Check this brother out, trying to be mean. This child is fierce! -All right, party's over. I want everybody in their bunk in two minutes. [CROWD COMPLAINING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Tried to call you today. -Well you didn't try very hard. I was there all day. -I got that transfer. I start at Miami International Airport tomorrow. The girl whose job I'm taking is getting married. And I got her apartment too. So I really lucked out. And along with that transfer I got a raise. But of course, I guess it's because I'll be working with the worst kind of passenger problems, like when they get bumped from flights and things. -Don'st waste much time, do you? -What's that supposed to mean? I applied for this transfer weeks ago. You know that. -It's funny how things work out sometimes, isn't it? -Merissa says it's probably a good thing that he got caught at this age. They change so easily. How is he? Is he doing well? -Andy? Oh, Andy's fine. He's doing just fine. -It's your leave. [WHISTLE BLOWS] -Let me have it. I said, let me have it! Now! You just earned yourself some room time. Now the rest of you, when I say I want this ball, I don't want to wait. I'm gonna teach football. Where you going? I already know how to play football. -I didn't say anything about playing. I said "teach." I teach, you learn. I'm your coach. -Yeah? Well then, what are you doing in a place like this? -Yeah! -Yeah, that's right! -So why don't you just lighten up and give us the ball, Wheels? [CROWD SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT] [WHISTLE BLOWING] -Now all of you have earned some room time! Now get over there and form two lines. [WHISTLE BLOWING] All right! All right. Way to go. [WHISTLE BLOWS] -Boom! That's it! That's the to stick.That's the way. -This dude is crazy if he thinks we're gonna keep this up. -You got any suggestions? [WHISTLE BLOWING] -Hey! -Need some help there? -I can handle it. I can handle it. Who told you guys to get out of line? Get back in line. Hear what I said? I said get back in line! -[CHUCKLING] You are beautiful. Really beautiful. I'll call you back later. Don't you quit at five? -Where are they? -Locked up. Room time, per your instructions. -Tell my boys I want to see them. -Haven't you had enough for one day? -Just tell them I want to see them, please. -All right, listen up. Jim's here and he wants everybody in the day room. Now, hotshots. -Thanks. -All right! Told you the coach wasn't such a bad dude. -Wouldn't bet on it, Shorty. -Anybody want to play rummy 500? Come on. Hey, Coach! I got to talk to you, man!! -Yeah? What is it? -Hey, Coach. I ain't supposed to be here, man. You know, I don't want to finger at nobody. But I just ain't supposed to be here. -They didn't put you here for missing school. -I'll tell you what the deal was, man. I was hanging out in front of the candy store. Next thing you know, I got busted, 'cause I looked like this sucker who stole some [INAUDIBLE] and knocked over a liquor store. And without a lawyer, what you supposed to do? -All right, you guys. Listen up! I got something I want to say to you. I'm starting a football team, and I want all of you to participate. Practice starts tomorrow at 10:00 AM. -We ain't playing for you, Wheels. -You don't have to. It's a matter of choice. Playing on this team and staying on the same is a privilege. You're gonna have to earn it. -Yeah, well, you know, we'll make our own team. -Right! -Yeah! -Wrong! I'm the athletic director and I pick the teams. Now, anyone that doesn't want to participate will be assigned field maintenance. Cutting the grass, painting, that sort of thing. -Is that supposed to worry us or something, man? -Take it any way you want. Those of you who want to make the team, 10:00 AM, sharp. Now back to the room. -Aw, man. [CROWD GROANS] -Makes you feel good all over, doing something for these kids. So appreciative. [SCREAMING] -I don't need this, loverboy. -Get back, man! Stay away! They're gonna get you! -Why's he in there? -Every time one of these kids gets out on a court date, comes back loaded. -On what? -You name it. PCP, I'd guess. -[INAUDIBLE] Get away! [INAUDIBLE] -All right, hey, you just-- you're going to the C ward! -What's the C ward? -CRMD, man, Crazy Rats Must Die. It's bad news. Once you go there, you don't come back the same. HECTOR: Rats, man! Rats! -McLeash! Give me the key. -Get my butt in the sling over that little space cadet? No way. They code says CRMD, and that's where he's going! -I don't give a damn about that code. Give me the key! HECTOR: Get away from me! Get away! Leave me alone! Dammit! Get away! Leave me alone! Get away from me! They're gonna get you! -Hector. It's me, Coach. Take it easy. -No! They're all over the damn place! -Take it easy. -Just keep them away from me, please! -Take it easy! -They're gonna get me! -Take it easy. They're not gonna get you. They're not gonna get you! Take it easy! -Look at 'em! -Where are they? -They're over there! -Over there. -Please, get 'em! -I see one. I got him. -Over there! -I got him, too. HECTOR: Now over here. Over here! Please! JIM: I got him. HECTOR: Please, over there! Right over there! Over there! Right over there. -Look! They're leaving. See? They're leaving. Watch! They're going! Watch! See? They left. They left, didn't they? -[CRYING] -You're all right. You're all right. You hear me? You're all right. They're not gonna get you, son. HECTOR: [SOBBING] JIM: (WHISPERING) They're not gonna get you, son. You're all right. They're not gonna get you, son. -You boys ready to play football? -We figure it's better than cutting the grass. -Get to it. -Come on, man. Let's get to it. -Hike! All right, way to catch! Good hands, man. Way to catch! Looking good, Hector, looking good. Aw, Andy, come on! If you can touch it you can catch it! -No kidding, Coach! JIM: Come on, hustle back here. Don't you walk back! Hustle back! Take off your shirts. -Oh, Coach, this is so sudden. -I didn't know. -Yeah, man. -All right, come on. You guys got to receive. Get down there. Little two-handed touch. Touch, you guys, come on! -This is it, guys, maximum security area. Right, Warden Turner? -Superintendent This is a maximum security cell. It is only used when someone is beyond the control of the staff and extreme corrective action is necessary. -Is this where you give them bread and water? -We don't do that here, kid. [WHISTLE BLOWS] -Come on! -Curtis! I said this was two-handed touch! All right, huddle up again. Call another play. -Jim Brandon, this is Mr. Forester, a teacher with the Montclair group of boys. -How do you do. -We have what you might call a scared straight program at Montclair. Get the boys out into the world, show them what it's like. -Hey, nice hands, huh? -Love the hand! How about that pass? -No wonder these guys are locked up. [LAUGHTER] -Yeah, we'll see how funny you think it is when I stick my foot in your mouth. -All right, let's go back to the bus, boys. Hey, let's go. Back to the bus. -Come on, you guys, be cool. Be cool. -What, are we just going to let them chumps get away with that? -Don't even think about it. Give me that ball. All right, five laps. -You better go on! [CROWD SHOUTING] -Get out of here! -Jim Brandon, right? I thought I recognized you. I was a big fan of yours when you were with the Bears. You do volunteer work here? -No, no. I'm full-time coach here. -I coach these kids from Montclair. Last year we were undefeated. Great looking bunch of boys, aren't they? -Does that excuse them from making fun of my guys today? -Oh, that. They didn't mean anything by that. -How about a game? -A game? -Football. Your boys against mine, next Saturday, right here. -You can't be serious. My boys won their division last year. It's too ridiculous, really. -We'll see about that next Saturday, Coach. [CROWD LAUGHING] -Man, are you kidding? -No, no, I'm not kidding! You're going to play 'em Saturday. -All right, all right. We'll wipe the clean off of them dudes. -Yeah! [CROWD CHEERING] -They're going down for the count! -Hey, that one kid with the blond hair, don't anybody get him, because he's mine. -Hey, now, wait a minute. Number one, no one is going to get anyone. We're playing football. Number two, these guys practice all the time. They're good. -Yeah? Well good ain't making it, Wheels, because we gonna be dynamite! [CROWD LAUGHS AND CHEERS] -Hey, Dynamite, who's in charge of the equipment? -Where you been, brother? -No equipment? SWEETLIFE: Sorry, brother. Sorry. JIM: Hi, Eddie. -Hey, Jim! Just think, I used to fly one of these things. What do you say we go to track this afternoon? I think I got something here in a second. -No, I can't, Eddie. I got to get the team ready for Saturday. -The team? A bunch of little punks, now it's the team? -You know what you ought to do? You oughta show them how to do that sometime. I bet they'd really enjoy it. -Yeah, they'd love it. Especially the glue. -Eddie, um, I need some help. -Shoot. -I need equipment for the football team. -How much? -The whole team. -Right in the back room I got shelves full of football equipment. Take whatever you need. -No, now look, I'm serious. -What do I look like, a sporting goods store? All right. I know this kid. He's a degenerate gambler. He's with me for a big price. Anybody else, I'd send 'em up for a long lunch by now. His old man owns a sporting goods store. -Hey! Hut one! Hut two! -Oh, hey! Washington! Washington, what did you flinch for, man? If it hadn't been for Palmer that would have been a touchdown! -I'm not gonna allow it. -Well, I'm committed to it. -You'll just have to call it off. -What is wrong with this school playing another school? -You see that barbed wire? Does that look like a school? This is an institution! -These boys have been working hard. They deserve a chance to play. -Kids, huh? You see that little darling, Sweetlife? He's headed for hard time. When he leaves here, he's going to Sheridan. When he leaves Sheridan, he's going to Joliet. And your own nephew, god bless America on him, arrested 12 times before his 13th birthday. Let's not forget Hector. You don't need to teach him how to hit. He hit every liquor store on the south side. And you want to bring another team in here? -Hector! Good catch, Hector! That's the way! Good hands, man! Listen, as coach of this team I think I ought to be able to make that decision. -Is that right? All right, I'm gonna let you learn the hard way. I'm also gonna let you do all the paperwork. -Fine. -Where'd you get those helmets? -Donation. -Regulations say donations must go through proper channels. More paperwork. I'm gonna let you do that too. -Fine! [WHISTLE BLOWS] All right, you guys, that's it for the day. 10 laps and hit the shower! Good day! Where you going? -I hurt my leg, Coach. -Oh, that's too bad. You won't be able to play in the game Saturday. 10 laps, Sweetlife. Come on [INAUDIBLE]! Run, you guys! -What's their record? -Last year they were undefeated. -Hey, forget about their record. You guys are undefeated, too. -We beat somebody I don't know about? [LAUGHTER] -All right. Get out there and play football. -Yeah! -Go! ALL: One, two, three, one! One, two, three, two! One, two, three, three! One, two, three, four! -Ready? ALL: Ready! -Ready? ALL: Ready! -Again! ALL: One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three! ALL: Three! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, five! ALL: One, two, three! -Run in place! -One, two, three, six! COACH FORESTER: Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! [WHISTLE BLOWS] -OK, St. Charles call it. -Heads. -Make sure it doesn't have two heads, ref. -Tails. -We'll receive. [CROWD CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] -[SHOUTING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] -15 yard, personal foul. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] -15 yards, personal foul. -What do you mean 15 yards, ref? -Cool it, or you're out of the game. [WHISTLE BLOWING] -Hector, middle on two. Ready, break! [CHEERING] -Hey, maybe if you chromed the football, you know, so it looks more like a hubcap? REFEREE: Break it up! Break it up! Break it up! [WHISTLE BLOWING] REFEREE: Break it up! Break it up! -What you groaning about, Chump? Just a game. -I hurt my ankle, that's all. -That's right, tear it down. You guys were really fantastic. You're not a team. You know what you are? You're a mob! -We got a few licks in, Coach. ALL: Yeah! -Yeah, you bloodied some noses. Are you guys proud of that? What about all that training? What about the game? -What about the way we knocked them on their butt? [CHEERING] -Yeah, we could have beat them if we wanted to. -No, you couldn't. You don't win football games by breaking heads. That isn't what it takes. -You ain't got what it takes, either. Else you wouldn't be here, man! ALL: Yeah! -Yeah, you're a loser, same as us. -You said you wanted to play football. I thought we were a team! -No, man, you said we wanted to play football. That game was for you! We was just your show pony, man! -You threw us to the lions, man. Why? -Because I thought I could pull you boys together, so you'd know what it's like to play as a team, what it means! -Well that's your college stuff, man. Maybe [INAUDIBLE] for them punks, but that doesn't mean a think to us, because we ain't going nowhere. [CROWD SHOUTS IN AGREEMENT] -What about your self-respect, huh, Hector? Maybe you're right. Maybe all you boys aren't going nowhere. -Why don't you just go coach them outsiders, Wheels? They dig all that jive. [CROWD SHOUTS IN AGREEMENT] -Hey, you take it easy! Get out of my way, Calvin. -Whoa, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be out doing your Monday morning post-game critique? Watching game films, discussing key plays, that sort of thing? Huh? Well, I can't say that I blame ya. -What do you want, Turner? -Well, you know that fella, uh, what's his name, Forester, their coach? He's mad! He called me there. You want to know what he said? -I'm not interested. -He said that he blames you personally and that his team is a disaster area. Oh, and McLeash said the team doesn't want anything to do with you. -McLeash has got a big mouth. You want something to worry about? You worry about McLeash. -Yeah. If it hadn't been for civil service he'd been gone a long time ago. But look! The point is, you had the misfortune of picking the worst group imaginable. Now, forget who talked you into this. That's not important. I've got an opening in records. You can finish out your six weeks there. -I'm a coach, not a file clerk. -Come on, James. Go! I got it! -Hold it! Give me the ball. -Are you kidding, man? We can't play basketball with this. It's got points, see? -First we start on our defense. Not that our offense is any better, but we've got to start some place. -What for? -What for? The rematch. That's what for. You guys proved they could beat you. Now let's prove we can beat them. -Hey, man, we tried that once. It didn't work. -You've got that right. We only got one chance. That's to fight our way out from under. We ought to start at Montclair. Let's go there. Let's beat them there like they beat us here. What do you say, guys? -I tell you what, Wheels. I think it's worth a shot. I'd like to get down on our freckle-faced friends, know what I mean? -And we can whip them, just like they whipped us. -Hey, I'd go another shot. -All right! -All right, you guys. Let's get out there, and let's get to work! -Let's go! -All right. -Hey. You really think we can beat them? -No way we can. -What was that all about? -Well, you heard what the man said. Play on their field. I mean, once I get outside this joint I'm done. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] COACH FORESTER: John, you've got to get in there quickly. You've got to make that X quicker! Now try it again. This is a surprise. -Merissa Laine, I'd like you to meet Coach Forester. -It's a pleasure to meet you. Your team looks very impressive. -Just what is it I can do for you, Mr. Brandon? -I'd like to arrange another meeting between our two teams. -After what happened the other day? -No, this is different. This is for charity. It's a benefit for the Underprivileged Children's Fund. Mrs. Stanton is in charge of the event. It's their big annual fundraising. -Dean Stanton's wife? -Yes, Mrs. Stanton. -Just when did you say this game was going to be played. -Two weeks from this Saturday. -It's a pleasure to meet you. -How did you know that Dean Stanton's wife was the head of the Underpriveleged Children's Fund? -She's not. But he doesn't know that. -Is something the matter with your head? Are you brain damaged or something? I want to know. -It was the only way we could get the game. -Do you realize what kind of a security problem you're talking about? -I'll take the responsibility. -It's not yours to take! The state has something to say about-- -I just want to play a football game. I don't want to change the Constitution. -Do you know why they put fences around this place? It's not to keep people out, it's to keep people in! That's why an institution of this kind does not take the population to picnics or ball games, because it's a problem! I've got 12 pages of directives and regulations governing transportation to take one kid on a morning hospital visit. -This game means something to these kids. Pulling together for this game can prove to them that they've got a chance, that they don't have to be institutions like this for the rest of their lives. -They don't give a damn about this game. The only thing on their mind is hitting that blacktop. -What I said the other day about cutting out? I was just jiving, man. -Oh yeah? -I mean, it's a dumb rule. You know what I'm saying? -Sure. -What about you? -Hell, I'm not doing 10 months in this place. If I see daylight, I'm splitting. -Hey, well, you ain't got a chance, man. -I'll write to you. -Look, son. I got it all worked out, and you ain't screwing it up. -There's no way you're stopping me. -[INAUDIBLE] My thing is set. We'll do it together, man. And not because I like you. 'Cause I don't. [WHISTLE BLOWS] -Aw, man, don't tell me, mystery burgers again? -We're on quiet, gentleman. Now, if you're not hungry, just say so and we'll fix you up with a little kitchen duty. -Sit down. I was watching you help the other guys today. I want you to know I really appreciate it. Every team needs a natural leader, someone to spark on the other guys. Yeah, well, you know, we got to get ready for the big day. -Right. -This food ain't helping much, though, I'll tell you that. Third time this week they give us this junk. -I'll look into it for you. I think the idea is you'll never remember any of the counseling. But if the memory of that food stays with you, you won't be back. -Well, that's fine if you're here for a week. But they want to keep me here for a long haul, attempted murder and all. I tried to kill my mother with a golf club. She was so smacked up. She started pulling my sister's hair and beating her up, 'cause she wouldn't stop crying. For all I know, she could have killed her, you know? Somehow hearing my sister crying, it made it worse than if it was happening to me. Later, man. -OK. Where's the decimal point? Now, see, that wasn't so hard, was it? -Why do I have to do this? I'm gonna be a boxer like Duran. Boxers don't need this junk! -You do care about staying on the team, don't you? -Yeah. -Get to it. That's a two. -Pizza and soft drinks, huh? You buy that for them with your own money? -I didn't buy it for you, McLeash, that's for damn sure. Where are my boys, in the day room? -The whole damn pack field. -Thanks. -Well all right! Let's get them boxes over here! -Hey, wait a minute. These guys been working? -Very hard. -All right. [CHATTING EXCITEDLY] -Hey, Coach, you think there are gonna be and scouts at the game? -What for? -The pros! I'm ready! -Hey, where's Andy? -Uh, in the dorm, I think. -Sweetlife, go get him. That is Andy's. -But everybody knows Andy don't like pizza. -Who said he don't? -He told me! -[LAUGHS] -Hey man, there's pizza outside. -Not interested. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. -So what's that nothing you just put under your pillow? -This. Just a letter from my old lady. Found herself an airline pilot. He wants to marry her. Not bad, right? I mean, uh, those guys make a lot of bread. Guy drives a Vette. He's got his own boat. He lives in California with his three kids. I mean, it sounds like a nice family. I almost forgot. She says she hopes and prays that I'm getting along OK. -Hey man, pizza's getting cold. Let's go. [LAUGHTER] -Hey, Andy, saved you some pizza! -You eat it. -Say what? It's mine? All right! -Andy, what were you doing in the room? -I had to get something ready for class tomorrow. -Need any help? Sure? Thank you. I got this feeling inside like I used to have when I was playing ball, just before a game. Butterflies. Feels good. I haven't had it for a long time. I've been faking it for a lot of years. -I liked watching you tonight. It was like being part of a family. -You know, for a long time I never thought I was gonna be a part of anything. I was numb for a year after it happened. Then it took me another year to make my mind up, whether I wanted to go on or not. Merissa, was I angry. I wouldn't listen to anything. I want these boys to know that they've got a chance. That's why this game is so important. And it's important to me to know that I can give these boys that chance. -Welcome home. -Come on! Way to go! All right! -What in the hell was that? You don't tell those boneheads to block they're gonna get the quarterback killed! -I called for a defensive blitz. [WHISTLE BLOWS] -OK you guys, come on! Hustle up, hustle up! Come on, hustle in here. I want to thank all of you for a good day. There'll be no laps today. [CHEERING] -Tomorrow is gonna be for real. All right, listen up. I want to see you all upstairs, now. -All right, who did it? -All right, all right. Hold it down. Move over a little bit. Give me some room. Here you go. Don't just stand there. Open 'em up! -All right! [EXCITED CHATTER] -OK, you're the coach. Take 'em down to the locker room and have 'em out! -I ain't never wore a real uniform before. -And you never will again if there's any funny business out there tomorrow, I guarantee it. Now, don't you guys get the idea I did this because I'm crazy about you. 'Cause I'm not. You'll be representing this institution tomorrow. I want you to look presentable. [CHATTERING] -Now, 22 of your are leaving for the football field, and 22 of you are coming back! You got it? -Yeah. -(SHOUTING) You got it? ALL: Yes, sir! [CROWD CHEERING AND MARCHING BAND PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hold it down! Hold it down! You get off this bus in a column of twos. That means no pushing, no grabbing, no bugalooing, or so help me. You got it? -Yes, sir! -Let's go! [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND CATCALLING] -Hey, hey! Check out the blonde, man. I think she digs me! -If I have to blow this whistle one more time it's back on the bus for all of you! -All right, let's go! Come on! [CHEERING] -Don't want any injuries. -We'll take care of it. -OK. Good luck, folks. [CHEERING] -Uh, anybody got any pills, uh, reefer, something? Just kidding. -You're a good team. You can beat these guys. How about it? -Fight! -Fight! [CHANTING] ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

The last time these two teams met, my guys won 28 to nothing. -Me myself, I like the underdogs. Would you like to place a little money on your team? -Sure. It's a ridiculous bet, of course. But you've got a few dollars you want to throw away, it's like money in the bank. -Shall we say, uh, $500? -All right. -What's happening, brothers? -All right. -White, your call to toss. -Tails. -Tails it is.

All right, come on, St. Charles! None of that fighting stuff. -All right, that's it. I'm gonna punch that number 22 right upside his head. Then maybe he'll pick on somebody his own size. -No, we can't do that brothers. But we can run a play to his side. Quarterback sweep left on two. Everybody, quarterback sweep left on two. Ready?

You just have to tighten your defense up a little bit. -Look, there's no question we can beat these guys. It's scoring on them that's the problem. [ALL SHOUT IN AGREEMENT] -Try 41 long, Hector up the middle. Here, some oranges. You're looking good, man. -Hey, Jim, I got to talk to you. -In a minute, Eddie. You guys want me to send in defensive plays? Is that what you want? Washington, my linebacker? -No, sir. -How about you, Mark? -No, Coach. -Well get to that quarterback, will ya? -We'll take care of it. -OK, Good second half. -I think you got some trouble. Those are the Rangers over there. And they're not here because they like charity events. I think they're here to spring your boys. -No, you've got to be wrong, Eddie. -I'd love to be wrong, believe me. But what if I'm right? I just bet Mr. personality over there $500 that your team was gonna win. What are you gonna do? -What am I supposed to do? Tell Turner? He'll call the game. I'm gonna bet they don't run. -I say it's five to one against you. Bad bet. ANNOUNCER: Well, the teams are back in the field for the start of the second half. Montclair has elected to receive.
