Why does it smell so bad even after you clean it? It's the infection. I'll clean it again tonight. Don't look so downhearted, Roberto. Take a lesson from Alberto. Nothing stops him. I have abandoned the Church of Rome in favour of Utopia. Good for you, Alberto. And for my part, my name is Federico Aranda and I will return. How is Federico? He has gangrene, I think. I know Alberto does. Look at this! Look at this! Watch out! Watch out! They didn't die, Roberto. Anything is possible. There was a piece of the wing. The taiI must be up there somewhere. Here's the plan. We pick a team to go after the taiI. - I'll go. - Me, too. We give the team the biggest rations and warmest clothes. Then in a week, we go find the batteries and start the transmitter. - It gets cold up there. - I couldn't do it again. Me neither. I need more money. Here. I wish we could have a fire every night, and that someone would go for pizza. - I'll pay if you go. - No, I insist. I'll pay, you go. I feel God has taken care of us. Don't you feel it? A sense of fate? I feel a sense of fate. I wanted you all to know... if I die, you have my permission... You can eat me. If anybody could hear this! Sit down, Antonio. Coche, it's too bad you didn't play the cello! - What? - I've decided something. - What's that, sweetie? - I want to have another baby. This experience... It's made me feel the miracle of life so deeply. It's not that, my dear. It's just that you're not eating. If you don't eat, how will you live? You're right. I'll eat some. I'll do it. I'll eat tomorrow. Yeah. I'll eat tomorrow... God bless you. - Where is everyone? - I don't know. Shine the light over here. Avalanche! I can't see! You all right? Who is it? Help! - Here's somebody! Here's somebody! - Go, go, go! Hold on! I'll get... Lilliana! Help me! For God's sake, help me get my wife! Please don't take her from me now! He's breathing. Nando! - Keep digging. Please, Nando! - Get him out! Pull! Pull him out! Eight are dead. Eight of us are dead. We can't go out. There's a blizzard. Let me see. Listen, today is Rafael's birthday. - So? - We've got to observe his birthday. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Rafael Happy birthday to you Make a wish. A wish? I just wish this was over. - It's still snowing. - It's a blizzard. You're not gonna believe this. - What? - Today is my birthday. Happy birthday, dear Carlitos I love you all so much. Happy birthday to you And my wish... my wish... Tonight, we say the rosary for the living and for life itself. That we have survived a plane crash, starvation and an avalanche... And tonight, Fito, no more kidding. You've got to pray with us. I'm not saying no rosary, Carlitos. I'm an agnostic. - What's that? - My God, it's another avalanche! HaiI Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb... Light. Good morning, Carlitos. Good morning, my friends. Do you know what today is? - No. What? - Today is my father's birthday. My father is an artist, a painter and a bit of a madman. And now in my heart, I do believe I'll see him again. - Do you feel it? - What? God. God is everywhere today. Over here! I'm here! This is where the dead were. Gone under the snow now. It's about the closest they'll get to a burial. - I'm worried about Eduardo. - Why? He's losing his spirit. - When are we going? - Fifteenth. - The fifteenth passed by. - The fifteenth of next month. That's too long. Winter's ending, nights'll get shorter. We'll have a chance. - Why are you crying? - Because I am so close to God. It's OK. So beautiful. It's beautiful. Wake up, please. Wake up, everyone. My name is Federico Aranda, and I have to tell you that Alberto Antuna, a brave boy, is dead. He was 21 years old. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. Let perpetual light shine upon them. May they rest in peace. Amen. - This should be enough to eat. - We should wait a few more days. - Why? - It'll be warmer. I waited. On the 15th and 16th, you said the weather was no good. I've been waiting on you for four weeks. Put your pack on, this is it. All right. How are you doing, Federico? Very well, Nando. Good luck on your journey. Thank you. They tell me you won't eat, Javier. It's up to you if you want to get out of here. Perhaps... Forget your wife! Forget her! Remember your living children! Will you eat? I'll eat. Good. - Stay well, Federico. Pray for me. - I will. We'll find the taiI and bring the batteries. - And if you don't? - We keep going. - Where? Through the mountains? - We'll find the taiI. - Got the radio out? - Just about. There's a lot of wires. - We'll figure it out. - All right, Eduardo, see these? - Little shoes. - Little red shoes. Take this one. When these are a pair again, you're going to be going home. All right? All right. Let's do it! Where'd you learn about transmitters? I didn't. I helped my cousins put together their stereos. - Now I'm the radio man. - Our lives depend on this. Who asked you? Don't upset me! I'm emotional as it is. - Come on. Leave him alone. - Let's go. Wait till you see... You're not gonna believe it! Chocolate! Sweaters! Clean underwear! A comic book I haven't read! Toothpaste! Delicious! This is a pretty good story. Maybe we should just keep walking tomorrow. What? We take the batteries back and send an SOS. That's it. All this time, the taiI was three hours away. Maybe we should just walk to Chile. What? You're talking shit. We don't have the equipment. We would die. No, we bring the batteries back and transmit an SOS. That's it. One, two, three... That isn't going to work. - I don't know. - We should walk... I'm not killing myself walking into the mountains. It's a stupid... All right. This is what we'll do. - We'll bring the radio here. - We can't hook up a radio. - We'll bring Roy. - I don't want to go. - We know nothing about radios. - I don't either! I don't know what these wires are! I only built a stereo! - We had a booklet. - You're going! You take it. You're smarter than me! I don't want to go up in the snow. I don't want to go! How much further is it? We've been walking a long time! I don't have any strength, you know? I feel sick and weak. - I wish he'd shut up. - This was your idea. - Careful! - Sorry. Burn something else. It'll be dark soon. I'm going to wrap this round my legs to be warm. - Goddamn it! - That was you. Why don't you give up? We'll make a fire. Tintin, let's make a fire. This stuff worked good. I feel snug as a bug. - What should we do? - Fix the radio. - If we can't? - It won't work. - When it does, no thanks to you! - I never said...! If it doesn't work, what should we do? Tintin? I don't know. Whatever you two decide. Mister Switzerland! - If the radio doesn't work, we... - I'm not climbing those mountains! Then I'll go without you. You'll die. You'll freeze to death. No, I won't. There's enough of this stuff here to make a sleeping bag. Look at this! Look. Look at that cake. Are we going the right way? I think so. - Come on! - I can't! - You know you can! - Leave me! We've got to keep going! If we get caught in this at dark, we're dead. - Go ahead! - What about Roy? You go on. I'll get Roy to the plane! - I told you winter wasn't over! - Leave me! - Come on! - I can't walk! I can't carry you. You'll kill us both! I can't! What do you mean you can't? You piece of shit! You can't tell me you can't do it! Get up and walk ten steps. - Get up and walk! - All right! It's them! - Did the radio work? - No. - Where's Nando? - I don't know. Come on! Come on! - Here! - Thanks. Didn't you see him? Federico's dead! - No good. - What do you mean no good? Try to sleep. - He's bad. - What's the matter with him? Are you surprised? How long can people live like this? Carlitos says the sleeping bag's ready. - No. - Yes. It's time to go. We almost died in that storm. Winter's not over! Listen to me. You have the will, but I have the brains. I say wait till the bag's ready. - The bag is ready! - It's not ready! Rafael's dead. It's time to go, Roberto. It's time. Before we turn into animals. All right. I still got the shoe! I still got mine. - God be with you. You'll be OK. - Thanks. - Wait! - Carlitos, let them go. I forgot to say I had a dream last night, a tremendous premonition. I saw green fields and flowers. I could smell the grass. Your expedition will succeed. Don't forget the pizza! Here you go. That looks like a good place to camp, right up there. I think this is the top. - Maybe this leads somewhere. - Be careful. Help, please! You'll fall too! Hang on! Give me the strap! I'll get you. Now hold on! Hold on! You got me? - Hold on! - I got you. Hurry! - You got me? - Yes. - Hurry up! - Hang on! Now get me up! Grab hold of me. Pull yourself! Go over me! So what do you think? You want to try the other way? - You ready, Roberto? - You see that line? - That's a road. - I can't see anything. Do you see it, Tintin? I see a line. I don't know if it's a road. - I think we should go back. - Go back?! Yeah. This mountain's too high. - What do we do if we go back? - Go to the road. - It might be a road, it might not. - I've the best eyes. That's a road. - I'm going back. - I'm going on. - What are you going to do, Tintin? - I don't know. How about this? We leave the stuff with you, we go to the top and see. - Will you wait for us, Roberto? - All right. Then I'm going back. I'm going to see a valley, a river. I'm going to see green trees and hills. Go back and get Canessa. Tell him it's going to be all right. Tell him to come up and see for himself. - Nando's at the top. - Did you get there? No, but he says it's marvellous. I have to rest. Mountains! Nothing but mountains. We've had it! We've completely had it! No, we haven't. Going through these mountains somewhere, there's a green valley. See those mountains? There's no snow on them. They must be 50 miles away. You think you can walk 50 miles? - If we have to, we will. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I can't. I'm not as strong as you. You know what it is that we've lived this long, the way we have? 70 days? That we climbed up here? Know what it is? It's impossible. It's impossible and we did it. I know. I'm proud to be a man on a day like this - alive! That I lived to see it, and see it in such a place, take it in! I love you, man! Look! It's magnificent. It's God. It'll carry us over every stone, I swear! I swear to you. We'll get Tintin. We'll send him back to the plane and take his extra food. You see? You see where the sun's going to set? That way's west. And to the west are the green valleys of Chile. We're gonna die, you know? Maybe. But if we die, we're gonna die walking. Good luck! We're going home! And so we were saved. Nando and Canessa breached the Andes and we were saved. Later, a group went back and buried the bodies. They built a rough stone altar by the grave, and over it they placed an iron cross. There's nothing more I can tell you. We were brought together by a grand experience.
