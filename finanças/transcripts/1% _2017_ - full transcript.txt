Come on, hurry up. There. Dig it deep. Shoulder height. Fuck me. What happened to you? Dad threw boiling water on my back. So, I stabbed the cunt in the throat. And threw him in the river. Rules are rules. How's he gonna get to learn? I will work something out. I've got a good idea. Why don't you bring your bitch? I'll introduce her to my bitches. Don't you fucking touch her. Don't you fucking... Get down! The bitches always the best fighters, you know. I mean, these ones, they prefer to fight than fuck. I gotta strap 'em down to breed. It's called a rape stand. But now they're angry. And every time they're looking at me, I swear to God, they're planning some type of payback. Your bitch ever look at you like that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Should we let 'em out? Eh? They'll rip your fucking throat out. You wanna save your brother? I wanna do business. You've done well for yourself, Paddo. Got a lot of cash that needs cleaning. We own a pub, we own a restaurant. We can wash your cash. Yeah, I can do that. I do that, I get 30%. And we wanna sell to your customers. Oh, she's a merry little fucking thing, isn't she? Back the fuck up, pal. I'll take 30%, and I'll wash your cash. Hmm? Or I'll kill that simple cunt. All right? Now there, you'd like to do that? Okay! "Okay"? Why? I was thinking of getting a bike for meself. You've got a fucking bike, Adam. It's his old one. He rode around that... You're not doing a fucking thing without me from now on. Do you understand? Yes. Is there any left? No. You fuck. He fucking tricked me. I had no fucking idea. You all right? Hand 'em over. - What? - Do you think I'm dumb? Jesus Christ! Never mind the blasphemy. Give 'em here. Are we clear? I don't give a fuck how many of these you swallow or you stick up your arse when you're not here. But in the club, these are banned. Them the rules. Piss off. Oi, Paddo. Check that other one on the side. TVs? Yeah. Huge ones. Katrina's idea. Like 'em? Youse didn't come to me. What happened to you? You know what? Give Knuck and I 45 minutes before you come in. He's only gotten out. Well, then, tell me what you wanna tell him, and I'll pass it on. Or don't. Push back on the gun. Push back on the gun, you fucking weird cunt. Listen to me. You need to take charge as soon as you get out. Oh, I am in charge. Nah. It's not the same when you're in here. Listen, Hayley, Paddo will fall in when I get out. And he's gonna do that because I put him there. I don't trust him. You don't trust anyone. He tried to fuck you, did he? Nah. No, he didn't try to fuck me. Just show him you're the president, and do it so the men can see it. They gotten bigger? You just puffed yourself out like a toadfish. I didn't do anything. No. Bigger. - You look good. - Really? Way bigger. I love you. What did she say? She said you are trying to fuck her. I've got a proposition. From who? Devils. And what is it? They can wash our paper. Can they? Knuck, there's too much of it, mate. It's useless if we can't filter it. If we wash it, we can buy assets. Legit. Renovate the clubhouse. We can buy a house. Well, that'll be good, wouldn't it? And what'll they want? Thirty percent. - Which is nothing. - No. It's 30%. Sugar come to you with this thing? Yes. Oh. So, what, you and Sugar are fucking best friends now, are you? It's a good deal, Knuck. I wouldn't be coming to you if it wasn't. You got to think about it. What happened to you face? A little scrap at the pub. Some fucking muppet. How's Skink? Good. Yeah. Besides whacking too much in the shower, he's good. All right. You set it up with your mate Sugar. But you set it up day one I get out next week. You understand that? - Day one. - Okay. What did he say? He said yes? He said he'd set up a meeting. A meeting? With who? Sugar. When? When he gets out? - Yes. - Shit, Mark. Baby. We gotta be careful. He gets out after three years and we just hand everything over to him? It's not like that. It's good business, Kat. It legitimizes everything. He'll see that. And Skink's okay. You should be president, you know that? He couldn't have done what you've done. He doesn't have the brains. Do you know what those men see in you? What I see in you? We'd die for you. You don't utter my name to anyone. You do it and I'll find out. Then I'll murder some cunt just to get back in here so I can cut your throat. You understand? Stop it now. It's okay. Shh. Where's your drink, dude? You're an idiot, Webby. You know it's fucking Ramadan? - Ramadan? - Mmm. - Fuck Ramadan. - Fuck Ramadan. - And fuck you. - Fuck me? It's a bar. You're here to drink. You don't like it, you can fuck off. Hey, you're a fat cunt, Webby. Count these... Skinks, Paddo reckons you got in a bit of a scrap the other night. Yeah, yeah. So, how many were there, brother? I don't know, they all look the same. They're all a bunch of perm heads. So, did you flog 'em or what? Yeah, well... One of them hit me in the face. I had blood coming out of my nose, so I got him in an arm bar, and then I broke his femur, and the... That's enough. That's enough, man. Even this will keep you in the camp for a week. Jesus. You should follow me down. Shot you a rim job with me missus. Got a tongue like a lizard. Oh, come on. Dib's gonna need a little extra this week. He got fired. It was a layoff thing. It wasn't his fault, all right? He needs a hand. Look at you. You could have got a nom to come and get me. Please. They can't hit 50 without shitting their pants. Did you look after him? Fucking, nos. - Wanna go home? - Yeah. Yeah. Push your fucking back on it. Push. Fuck! Give it here. Oi. It's the way it should be. Thank you. I missed you. I really fucking missed you. Yeah, I missed you too. What was it like in there? You saw me in there. That's what it's like. Anyone try to come after you? And do what? Give you the bash or something? - Bash? - Yeah. Nah. No one tried to give me the bash. 'Cause you're not going back. You're right. I wanna try for a kid again, Knuck. What, Knuck wants his own song to come in to, does he? What, his own national anthem? Knuck! Jeez! You look big. Or bigger. You still got that, uh, skinny flexing arm? Why, sure. Bomber. You're still a vodka and orange man, aren't you, Knuck? Hey, look. A nice little pink umbrella there for you, too. Or do you want me to get you a low carb beer? Or maybe even a light? How about we just get down to business, huh? Yeah, sure, Paddo. Paddo tells me you want 30% to clean our paper. Correct weight. Okay. What happens then? Oh, you'll make money. Legitimate money. And you're not gonna try and renegotiate your fee or anything? Nah! You have my word. Back the fuck up. And stay real fucking... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hey, look at me. You think it's funny? Can you read that? Right? That says "president." So I'm still the president, not him. Not him. You ask me. So, if I ever catch you talking to any of my men about business, I'll tie a dishwasher around your ankles, and I'll drop you in one of your billabongs. Hey, Knuck, you forgot to drink your vodka and orange juice, you fucking rude cunt. Can you please put your shirt on, mate? Oh, you all right? - I'm sorry. - Jeez! Fuck. What are you reading? New cars? Mark doesn't drive cars, just Harleys. Yeah, well, I'll be driving it, won't I? Are you driving to Knuck's party tonight? I'm gonna try and be with Josie. I don't think that's a very good idea. Why? Because you and her are different. You're different than Mark. Well, I just don't think she'll be very nice to you, okay? She's nice to me. She's nice to me all the time. Hey, one on the pokeys. - What happened? - Oh, he threw it straight back at Sugar. That was supposed to get Skink square, Mark. Do you realize what that means? If Knuck doesn't do this, I'll kill him, Mark. You need to convince him. I'll take care of it. What the fuck is he wearing? We got new hoodies. Take it off. What? What are you looking at him for? - I don't know. - You don't know? Well, you seem like a real fucking prospect, don't you? Who are you? I'm David Seamus. He's an accountant. So you've been counting my money? Yeah. You look at him again while I'm asking you a question, I'm gonna bite your fucking nose off. He's a good kid, Knuck. We could use him. I'll tell you what, David. You take that thing off, go outside and put it in that big fire. - Fuck off. - Yeah. - They're banned. - Why? Because we're a 1% club, not a fucking netball team. Hey, Notu, do us a favor, would ya? - Yo. - Take off the hoodies, whoever's got 'em. Fuck! I knew he wouldn't have liked them. Hey, Josie. Hi, Adam. What are you doing? Talking to you. You got a new tat. Yeah. I got it for Knuck. I'm thinking of getting one on me bonnet. You know, as a surprise. Why the fuck would you do that? 'Cause he would fucking love it. Do you want any drugs? I got some. You know we're not allowed to in the clubhouse, Skink. You don't have to pay for any. What would I have to do? What would you do? Would I have to fuck you? You can if you want. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let me think about it. You make sure that every nom can ride from here on. Every one of them. I'll get 'em around to it. I don't care if you make him jump through rings of fucking fire, Webby. Just make sure they don't embarrass me on a run. Come out and have a drink with your men. You haven't seen most of them for three years. Go talk to 'em. About what? I don't know. Ask them how they've been. Can you move for a sec? Please? I swear on this nom. This accountant. You look good, bro. Whoa! You had enough, Noisy? You nominated this prick, all right? You're gonna look him in the eye and flog him like I flogged you. Hear that, Noisy? Look up. Stand him up. Stand him up, Webby. Stand him up. You have David Seamus, who's the fucking accountant. Do you swear allegiance to me, and the Copperhead Motorcycle Club, Australia? - Yes. - Yeah? Yeah. - To me? - Yes. Look at me. Hmm? Hmm? So... I'm back. And there's a lot of faces here I don't know. I've never seen 'em before in my life. I have no idea who you are. I don't know who the fuck you are. But you've all been vouched for. So I will say what, we'll see. You wanna nominate anyone, you bring him before me. Me only. You understand? Yes. Answer your pres! Yes! Get him up. Come on, come on. I got you. All the best. Copperhead forever! Copperhead forever! Webby, love him up, sew him up. Thanks. Welcome back, Pres. Looks like a big fucking lolly. Already got a bike. Hey! Someone's gonna work dick and that's me! Bloody Tracey, everybody. Pay up. Bullshit. You're fucking smoking. Stop it. - Boost! - Fluke. No, it's not. I never miss. I'm too good. Good shot. That bike looks very flash. I thought you were gonna take care of this, Mark. Knuck, can I have a word? In a minute? Right now. Yeah, what now? It must feel different being out, I know. Feel different being here. I've only tried to make you feel welcome. - Welcome? - Yes, Knuck. In here, my club? - You asked me to look after things. - Yeah. To look after the men. I've done what you asked. - I wanted you to... - What? I wanted to hand it back to you in better shape than when you went in. More money, more men. No trouble. Things are different now. If we're smart, everything changes. We'll never have to look over our shoulder ever again. We never have to worry about money. We never have to worry about other clubs. About the fucking Jacks? Oh, is that what your fucking mate Sugar told you? What the fuck is your obsession with... Listen. Listen to me. And you listen really fucking carefully. Things aren't different out here now. Not while I'm involved. Hmm? And I don't want anyone's help. Do you understand that? And I'm not gonna split money, and I'm never, ever gonna sit around the table with some other cunt from another club and talk about how we can help each other. And I never asked you to do any of that. Did I? - Did I? No. - No. Now, we've got more money. And we've got more men, for good or bad, we're fine now. So thank you. What the fuck, Skink? Shut the fuck up. So, what do you got? I got some goey. Some speed? Fuck that, Skink. Wait. I got some hezza. It's mine. But I'm not supposed to have it. So, you can't tell. If I give it to you, you cannot tell. Do you like that? Hey, brother! Must be good to have him back. Yeah, it is. Bet he can't keep his hands off you. Yeah. He did okay, your bloke. Yeah, he had some help. Knuck will take it from here but. Yeah, we'll see, I guess. I may not be that smart, but I do know paying someone else to do something you can do yourself is fucking stupid. Hey, hey... Josie licked my ears. Uh-huh? Just ears? She touched my dick too. I knew it! I fucking knew it! It's just... It's all just part of the initiation. Yeah. - It happened to me. - Yeah. I had my nose broken and everything. Yeah, yeah. Paddo told me. Yeah, it's all good. So where are you from? Uh, Sydney. Come over to go to uni. You're being a real smart fucker. Smart fucker who likes to ride motorbikes. Sort of, yeah. I only started last year when I met Katrina and Paddo, so... And you like 'em? You like Paddo and Katrina? Yeah. They're real good people. Paddo... Really looks after his brother. Like no other. So, what are you riding? A, uh, Sportster. Hmm. You can ride that new thing if you want. That's your present. Not really my style. I could teach you to ride. - If you want. - Yeah. All right. We could come a few rounds with me. Show you around. - You wanna? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're awesome. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you... I told you! Get off me! Shut up, bitch. Get off me! You fucking slut! Let her go. Let her go. Get your hands off her. Let her go. What is going on? Look at her. She's off her fucking chops. You fucking slut. Hey! Are you fucking stupid? Seriously! What the fuck is wrong with you? What's this? Jesus fucking... Come here, you... I get out one fucking day. I'm out one fucking day, and you want me to go back to fucking prison? This is fucking heroin. It wasn't mine. It's not yours? Where'd you get it? Where did you fucking get it? Who? - Who? - Skink! - Come here. - I'm sorry Skink. I didn't sell it to her. I didn't sell it to her, Knuck. You gonna hit me? You simple fuck. Your old man should have drowned you at birth. You're out. No, Knuck... Webby, you fat fuck, take his cards. Knuck, I can... No! - No, no, Webby. - Take it off. - No, this is my jacket! - Take it off. This is my jacket! - Take it off. - I fought with this jacket! No! No, no! You know I didn't mean it. Come on. Turn on the music. Turn it back on now. He pissed himself, Mark. Okay, come on. It's all right. You're all right. You're all right, mate, you're all right. Breathe. Come on, you're all right. You wanna take a shower? Let's take a shower. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Let's take a shower. Ah, fuck. Hey, we're off? I think we're done here, so... What's got into you? What are you doing? Let go of me, you fuckin' cunt. Get off me. Bugger. Shut up. Shut up. Just throw your shit on the fuckin' floor. Kid gone, eh? I'll be outside doing some quin. We should move away from here. - Why? - Just... Enjoy. Where? Queensland. I fucking hate Queensland. Where else would you go? You wouldn't know anyone there, Mark. Yeah, that's the point. That's the point. I don't know anyone there. Fresh start. No baggage. You listen to me, we're not going anywhere. We've worked too hard to get to where we are, we're not giving that up. And I know you'll do whatever it takes to look after us, that's why I love you so much. That's why those men love you, that's why Knuck is so fucking threatened. You are not the sort of man that walks away from anything. He won't budge. - Yeah, I know. - I need more time. You don't have the numbers to overthrow Knuck. - Maybe I do. - No, you don't. And you know why? Because he is the club. He is the president and he is protection. And you're none of that. Give me a week and I'll get it done. You're not fuckin' listening, are you, Paddo? I don't wanna do business with him. Because in the end, he'll just fuck it up for no other reason other than the fact that he likes to fight. But I wanna do business with you. My advice? You take him out. You'll live with what's left and you keep building. Come into business with me and you'll make more legitimate money than you've ever made in your fuckin' life. And if you don't, I'll kill your brother by the end of the week. You kill him, you're going to have to kill me. Yeah, I know. Hey, Web. Hello. How you doing? Yeah, going good. Hey. What? What? First night out, you could've come home. I fell asleep at the club. I'm here. Hmm? What are you doing? What the fuck does it feel like I'm doing? - Something like that. - Yeah? You still have it when you're hungover. Stop it, please, Hayley, just, not, hey... Stop it. Maybe you just getting old, eh? Maybe it's you getting old? Maybe I don't wanna stick it in you. You're a cunt. Hayley. Hayley! Hayley! Hayley, you know I didn't fuckin' mean that. Mark. Mark. Hey, Mark. What did he say? He said to kill Knuck. Rebuild. Take control. Go into business with him. And Skink's okay. So just do it, if that's the only way. Well, we'll do what we talked about. Run? It's not running. I don't need this. I kill Knuck, ten years later, in the end, it doesn't fuckin' matter, someone kills me, Skink, or you. Kill him. Save your brother. Can I sit down? Where'd you get this? Dad's stuff. It's me bookmark. We'll be all right, eh? Yeah. Always have been, haven't we? - Yeah. - Yeah? Knuck. That your choice? I choose my brother. You're out as well then. No, he's not gonna survive by himself. He's your fuckin' brother too. He's a brother to every single one of ya. Did you tell the men what you've turned down? Your brothers? Money. Hundreds of thousands. A chance for every one in the club to share in it. To build something legitimate. Something that Jacks can't touch, but you didn't want that, did you, Knuck? No. You've been like a fuckin' father to me. You're a dumb cunt, Knuck. You know what your fuckin' problem is, do you? Tell me. You're not fucking real. You're a fake. You like all this, you like the leather, you like the ink. You like the motorbikes. Then you might as well be a male model or a fag. Yeah, you're right, Knuck. Maybe I am a fake. We've all got our secrets. Don't we? Don't we? Knuck, fuck you. Take your fuckin' hands off him. Put the fuckin' gun down before I shove it up your arse! Shut the fuck up, you black cunt! I'm the fucking president. Me. You understand? Knuck! You're with me or you're not. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. - Fuckin' pussy. - Fuck off. - Fuck Knuck. - Fuck him. Fuck Knuck! I want sluts. Ah! Oi, what's this shit? What the fuck happened to your face? What happened to you? Knuck did it, he threw him out. No, Knuck... He didn't throw me out. Well, if... You're out. Get the fuck! - What? - What the fuck... Hey, hey, hey. Fuck! Everyone get the fuck out now. Everyone get the fuck out! Now! Hey. He's made up his mind, there's nothing I can do. Yeah, well, Mark didn't do anything wrong. Yeah, but he chose. It's his brother. Yeah. A simpleton who can't keep out of trouble, and you know what? Fuck Paddo. Knuck has done everything for him. You really believe that, don't you? I know that. I thought you were smart. He fucks around on you Hayls, with men. Oh, yeah? Yeah. - You're pathetic. - It's true. Is it? All you wanna be is me. I've seen it in your crazy fuckin' eyes. Be you? Yeah. You got nothing I want. I got Knuck. And I got the clubhouse. You go in there, and I'll have your fucking teeth kicked in. Now, fuck off. Okay. Here, Knuck asked me to get it for you. Hey. What are you doing here? Huh? Shouldn't you be with Paddo? She's hot. Yeah. I spoke to Mark, he made a deal with Sugar. What deal? Hmm, doesn't matter, 'cause he's not gonna take it. So we're gonna have to move. Mmm, go on the run actually. Why? Where are we gonna go? I don't know. Everything he's worked so hard for, just.... Gone. And we'll be looking over our shoulder forever, you know why? Because you mucked up. Adam. Again. It's not all your fault, Knuck shouldn't have kicked him out. He didn't do anything wrong, did he? You did. Adam. Look at me. Mark might not love you anymore after all this mess. The fuck are you doing here? I thought Knuck was here. No, he's not. Is that why you broke in, so you could shoot him? Yes, but not you, Hayley. You need to leave, Adam. Go on, go home. You'll tell. No. I won't. I can't go home unless I shoot him. Get the fuck... Kate. - You seen Skink? - Mmm-mmm. He's not here? Oi. Oi, hey. Skinky! Adam! Fuck! I just want you to love me. Mark, what's... How could you say those things to him? How could you do that? To him! Well, you weren't gonna do it. I can't fucking do it! Well, I'm sorry, Mark, but he's gone. So take charge, man up. He fuckin' shot Hayley. Hayley, who? Who, who, who? - Who? - Where were you? Fuck off, cunt! Who? Tell me. I told you not to trust him. - How many more? - They're getting here as fast as they can. Fuckin'... Come on, David and Burn, cover the back door. Right! Up against the windows! You stay here, you understand? It'll be right, eh? Hey, Knuck, what's going on? - Where are your colors? - In the car. - Go get 'em. - What? Go and get 'em! I don't wanna do this. I don't want. Please, don't do this. - Please don't. - Get in the fucking car. You stay here, you die! Go. Fuckin' go! They're not coming, let's just go. Fuck up!

You came to kill me. Eh? I did. I didn't mean to shoot Hayley. You sent a fuckin' half-wit to do it? I wanted to 'cause I don't like you, Knuck. - I fuckin' hate you. - I don't fuckin' like you either, Adam. I fuckin' hate you, you're a fucker. - Brother... - What's that?

I'm done. - You're done? - Yeah. Webby's going to testify. His sentence is going to be suspended. You're out. He's going to be president. Well, that's what we'll call him anyway. But it'll be me pulling the strings, it's my club now, it's all you left me. It's never gonna happen. It's fucking happened. Rot in hell. Hayley, sit down! Hayley! - Open up. - Sit fuckin' back down.
