( Die Akashi! Get out of here! Trash! ) Kou-chan... I'm off now. Where are you going? Work. You can't be serious? Take the day off. Stay here with your father. I can't do that on a Friday. Hey, big brother. We're tight on cash, so you better find some work. And make sure to sell the workshop. What happened? "Where do good and evil stem from?" "And on which side do I stand right now?" Allow me to express my condolences. Does your son intent to stay here for a little while? I haven't decided yet. Once you've decided, please make sure to let us know. I will. Please wait over there. Okay. Who are you? Right back at you. What are you doing here? Well... This is our property. I see. Akashi-san's son? Yes. So, what are you doing here? I'm indebted to your father. The name is Kitamura. I heard there wasn't going to be a funeral, so I wanted to give him my last farewell. Right. It's frustrating, right? It must be frustrating, right? Someone who did the right thing was driven in a corner and those who were wrong live. That's unforgivable. If it was me, I'd never forgive them. Please contact me whenever you need something. ( House of Windmills, Kitamura Kenichi ) Do you have something to say to the people who were harmed? Excuse me. I have nothing to say. Just one comment. Excuse me. I really don't. I'm sorry. If you excuse me. Morning. Sorry. I haven't made breakfast yet. It's fine. I'll make it. Sorry about that. I went to dad's workshop last night. That place... I hope we get to sell it soon. There's a lot of scrap. What's that all about? Don't ask me. Ever since that recall happened, he'd never spoken a word to us. That so? I met a man called Kitamura-san. He said he's indebted to dad. Who? Kitamura-san. Who's that? I've never heard that name. I'll get it. Allow me to express my condolences. I'm Nakamachi Automobile's Miyake. I've been indebted to Akashi-san, so would you allow me to burn some incense for him? And please also accept this small token of... Don't come here! Leave! Well... It would be a lie to say I don't feel sorry for what has happened. - At least... - Leave! Please don't misunderstand, but him taking his life has caused us trouble as well. The trial was still going on... We're talking complete defamation. Wasn't it you guys who killed him!? How many people's lives do you think have gone astray because of your husband? His false accusations, getting the neighborhood involved... Even his suicide. He must have realized the severity of what he had done and could no longer bear it. So long. Mom! Please let go off me. You don't know anything about your old man, do you? If you excuse me. Mom! I'll figure something out. ( Nakamachi Automobile suspected of concealing recall ) ( Akashi Motors as whistle-blower ) Kawagami. Akashi... Why? What brings you here? Your father? What are you doing? Leave it alone. It's behind us now. I can't just leave it alone. What's the meaning of all this? I found this in my dad's room. What exactly happened? It's a hub bearing. It's a part that smooths the rotation of the wheels. If its strength is too weak, the wheel can come off and increase the risk of an accident. He decided to be a whistle-blower, was ostracized, got into debt, and went bankrupt. That's all. Ostracized? Yamaguchi-san. Long time no see. My apologies for the sudden call... I've had lots of things to... You're back now? Our severance payments and salaries... We've been put off all this time. Isn't it because of your dad's uncalled-for actions that things have become like this? Since they lump us together with him, we can't even find work. Didn't he simply do the right thing? It's not like my dad was wrong, right? It's not about being right or wrong. If you're not willing to pay, you won't like what's coming. Wait... Just... Some Miyake from Nakamachi Automobile paid us a visit. Then go talk to him. It's got nothing to do with us. We're currently not able to get your call. Please leave your name and your message after the beep. Hey, Akashi! When are you going to pay up!? Don't think it's forgiven only because he's dead! We're coming for you! We know where you live! Want us to burn it down!? Kou-chan... Shall we run somewhere? I'll figure something out. ( House of Windmills ) I was waiting for you. Was it easy to find the way? Ah, yes. Your father often helped us out here. Since we were completely shorthanded. I see. The robot over there. It was made by him. He often made them for me too. Your father was the very picture of a good person. Kitamura-san. Why... do you think my father died? I don't know. After all, people can't see what's behind the curtain. There's no person without two sides to them. Perhaps not even you have truly known your father. Probably not. You're low on funds right now, aren't you? Yes. If you like, you can work for me? But I don't have any qualifications... You don't need any qualifications. I'd like you to work the night shift. Ah, sure. Or maybe I should let you cook here during the day instead? You can cook, right? Oh? Your father was talking so proudly of you. "Our son is working as a chef in Tokyo." Nah, I just worked in the kitchen of some izakaya. The children would be delighted. All those children were abandoned by their parents, but here they come to trust each other, become a family and learn how to live a proper life. No matter what happens, we should live by helping each other. What kind of work are we talking about? For today, all you have to do is observe. Okay. What are you going to do with your father's workshop? We're thinking about selling it. Your father also helped us out at night. It will become difficult without that place. If possible, I'd like you to leave it be. Say, does this job involve dismantling? I've never done this before. - Evening. - 'Sup. This is Akashi-kun, our new help. It's his son. He's starting today. What's the situation? Today, I'm going to pick three or four down south. We gotta show him the ropes today. Got it, sure. Sounds good to me. Shin, you go with him. - Okay. - Right. Good idea. - Let's get to it. - Yes. - You come with me. - Ah, okay. Akashi-san, I'm Aogi. Okay. I'm sorry about your dad. Tell me if you need something. I'll do whatever I can. Say... Where exactly are we heading? I'm totally lost here. It's fine. You only have to observe. Here. Please put it on. Found you. Alright, ready for the next one? That's it for tonight. Is this... stealing and selling? Yes, stealing and selling. Are you sure that's okay? There are days when we ship them off as a whole and days when we're using your workshop. Keep your nights open. I don't... Tomoko. Everything loaded? Okay, let's go! Gimme some light. What your father did was unmistakably the right thing. What we're doing right now is a crime, but it's the only way we can protect those children. It's trusting in the laws that were made to protect us people that caused your father to lose his life. By breaking these laws, we can offer those children a life. The law can't decide what's good and evil. If you don't believe in your own righteousness, you can't protect those important to you. Translation: hpriestsubs @ twitter And that's when Jesus called the crowd to him and said, Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them. For it is from within, out of a persons heart, that evil thoughts come. Theft, murder, malice, deceit, envy, slander, arrogance and so on. All these evils come from inside and defile a person. You're such a big help. We've had a rotation system due to the shortage of people, but everyone complained when it was my turn. I'm not that great of a cook myself. Don't say that. Was it an Italian restaurant or something like that? I simply helped out in the kitchen of some izakaya. Well, it's better than mine, that's for sure. Your father happened to cook for us from time to time as well. It was super delicious. - My dad did? - Yes. The children were overjoyed when he made hamburger for us. Everyone's looking forward to your dishes. I'll do my best. Okay, we're back. We're back! Take off your shoes. Okay, come inside. We're back! All right, so... We have a new cook starting from today. Chef Akashi. It's my pleasure. Where are you from? Tokyo... Tokyo... He's from Tokyo? Amazing, huh? Okay, everyone... - Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food. Oh, it's good. I knew you were good. Nah. It's just curry. Yummy, right? First, you fold it in half. In half? Like that? In half. You fold it here. Right in the middle. Hey. You're... Nana. Ah, right. Nice to meet you. Say, what's Tokyo like? How should I put it? It's fun, for the most part. Why? Do you want to go to Tokyo? Not really. Why did you come here? How should I explain... - My father died, so... - Why? As for why... - Well, I had my reasons. - What reasons? It's her who drew that. Nana-chan, you mean? How do you know her name? She just started a sudden conversation with me. Asking me about Tokyo. She did? She's a peculiar girl, huh? Her drawing, too. Her color usage is amazing, really. All the children here were either separated from their parents or the victims of abuse. But everyone's expression is incredibly happy. Why do you think that is? I've no idea. They all believe the same thing. That their parents will come and pick them up one day. Of course that almost never happens. But having that ray of hope makes a huge difference. Good evening, Kitamura-san. Yo. Making some good money? Yes, thanks to you. How many times can you come next month? Four times, please. Good work. Tomoko-san. She just came here. We gotta help her out. She got a visa? She doesn't. Alright. I'll find a club for her and a place to stay. I'd like you and Tomoko to make the rounds and collect. Learn from her. Good morning! Rise and shine! It's morning! Good morning! Get up! It's morning! Sleepy? Good morning~ Ah, good morning... Is something the matter? No. Yurika-san. Yes? You know... My dad... What kind of person was he? He was an incredibly bright and kind person. He always brought toys with him whenever he came. And... He always came by in the morning. Dressed in his work clothes. Ryu. It's you now. I'm exhausted. I need a break. You should think about your age. You're an old man now. That's a nice one. Birds? Yeah. The career counseling is coming up. Have you decided yet? Yeah, I'm going to work. But you want to draw, don't you? We both know that's impossible. That's not true. Liar. Guys! Kitamura-san is here! Play with us! - Fine. Fine. - Play with us! - Play with us! - I'm playing with you. Say, what are we going to do today? Today, it's world reformation. Here! Take this. Yes? Okay, got it. Yeah, we're almost there. Yes. Found ya. How bold of them. Okay. W-Wait! Restrain him! Restrain? Why!? Akashi! Bring the car around! Hurry! Yes! Shin-san. Your hand! Hurts like a bitch. Damn, you beat us. Yeah, we got two. I cut my hand. Yeah. Later. Yeah. Kei got five of them. What a beast. What's wrong? I just... Why are we doing this? You see, 80% of the parents of the children are in prison because of their drug addiction. Those guys don't deserve to live. The sellers and the buyers. That's Kitamura-san's opinion. And my dad did this, too? No, he was only doing the dismantling. He was quick, being a mechanic and all. "I'll do anything for my family and employees," he said. Well, I can't speak for Kitamura-san, but I wouldn't mind if you decided to quit. We're off now. Midori, come! Not so fast, Dad! Okay, distribute them. Your plans for your future. Hand them in until next Monday. Yes. Excuse me for being late. Right. I was told about your circumstances. - Morning. - Morning. - Midori, I saw your LINE message. For real? - It was the worst, I tell ya. - Your dad? Did he report it? - He went to the police. Morning. - Morning. - Good morning. Miyake-san, I heard what happened. Everything all right? I'm such a sound sleeper. I didn't notice it at all. There's a lot of car thefts these days. Well, I was thinking about getting a new one anyway. I was supposed to have my golf clubs in the trunk. Guess I'm lucky. You know, you could have just transferred the money. I was startled when you suddenly called me here. How come? Well, I got it from the inheritance, borrowed from relatives and so on. Ah, I see. My apologies that you had to wait so long. Nah, I'm totally fine. But the others, you know. Tell me boyo. What are you gonna do now? I'm thinking of clearing my father's name. You probably won't take advice from me, but... You know... How should I put it... You really shouldn't stress too much about revenge or something. Why? It's that kind of town, you know. Everyone is friends with each other. Kawagami didn't have much of a choice either. Anyway... Send your mother my regards. I'm back. Are you doing something dangerous? Give us a break, will you. The last thing we need is a headline about the son becoming a criminal. Who do you think I'm doing this for? Oh? Kou-chan? Kou-chan, welcome home. Did you eat? For you. Thanks. "My collected evidence was stolen." "Was it Kawagami?" - Good to see you. - Right. Something wrong? Nah, I just figured I should drop by from time to time. Thank you very much. You got a new car, huh? I got some extra revenue to spend. Anything unusual recently? A while back, Akashi's son dropped by. We're ready. I'm amazed, though. He actually paid the full sum. There's no way in hell that's not dirty money. What's he going to do now? No idea. Something about clearing his father's name. And how's he gonna do that? Kawagami's got all the evidence. That's because you sold the evidence to him, didn't you? You're such an ass. How dare you! You see, I simply did what had to be done. Of course. He got too fired up. It caused trouble for all us! I simply did the right thing. Don't you want to live in peace? Peace! Well, now that he killed himself. Who cares? Right? Here are your drinks! Hurry up, man! - I got plenty of money, so keep 'em coming! - You're disgusting. - Okay, cheers! - Cheers! - You definitely did! - I don't remember. Hey! Huh? Oh, it's you boyo. What brings you here? - The hell, dude? - Hey, you better stop. Look. If you hit me, you'll have to pay me again. You want that? You can't do it, right? Stop it! I said stop! Stop it! I told you to fucking stop! The hell is wrong with you? That's enough! Listen. I'm not your guy. I gotta pee! - You're joking, right? - I'm serious, I'm leaking! Wow. It's a green sky today? Do you ever draw it blue, the normal way? Why is blue normal? Usually the sky is blue, right? It's black and red, too. But not green. We just haven't seen it yet. Well, yeah... sure. Hey Nana, what will you do in the future? Why? It's just that I'm curious, I guess. I'm thinking about my future, too. Will I stay here or go to Tokyo? Wanna go to the same university? I... wouldn't mind. As if I'll ever be able to go to a university. You don't know that. Yuki! Let's go. Let's go to a karaoke. Have fun. I'll continue to invite you. Hurry. Yes, an apple. Do you know apple seeds? - Apple seeds. - I know. You do? Ta-da. Look. Sooner or later, they turn into a big tree and... Welcome back. That... Did you get into a fight? I didn't. Your father often had the same expression. What's up? It's your birthday next week? I heard it from Yurika-san. Yes. Is there anything you want? No. The heck? Tell me. Do you have a girlfriend? Huh? Why? You don't, do you? Yeah... Not right now. Do you like guys? - I don't. - You look a bit gay. I'm not gay. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? Why? I just... Since you asked me. Interested? It's not like that. You came here... for revenge, didn't you? What will happen after you get your revenge? What will become of your life? I'll be your girlfriend, so we can live together in Tokyo. What did you just say? I'm messing with you, lolicon. - Evening. - Yo, good to see ya. Aogi-kun... Yes? It's just, I'm curious... Can you pick more than just cars? Yeah, anything that has a lock. I'd like to ask you a favor. - Papa, I told you about the shoes I want, right? - Right. What? In that case, I want to look for a new cleaner, too. - The current one is still working, though. - But it's been 10 years already. You forgot. - One second. - Isn't he just awful? Geez. Hello? Yeah. Kawagami-san. We'd like to have a minute of your time. About the whistle-blowing incident regarding Nakamachi Automobile from before. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Huh? What about it? Yesterday, we received those documents. Could you take a look? - It was yummy. - Thank you. - It was delicious. - Thank you. Thanks. Nana, is there anything you'd like to eat tonight? Mmmh... Meat. What meat? "What meat?" Some incredible meat. - What's that supposed to mean? - Like, "Meat!" - That's too difficult! - I'm looking forward to it. Take care. Excuse me. About the thing we talked on the phone. Man, Nakamachi sure is the figurehead of our town, so we're really reluctant to write about this, but you know... Give me a break. Those are definitely fake. We will cut our advertisements. Even if you say that... Well, we're going to investigate the matter, but it must be some other company's doing. The previous Akashi Motors case. Do you think it's related? I wonder, but since the person himself is dead, I don't think that's case. Anyway, keep it down. We definitely should have hamburger. I'm the one making it anyway. But a hot pot is easier. Let's do that. - No, I want hamburger. - No, hot pot. No, hamburger. Let's make hamburger, okay? - Huh!? - Hello. Yo. It's kinda awkward, meeting at such a time. True. My bride. You have a wife, huh? No, not yet. Hey, introduce yourself. Sorry about that. - Bye. - Bye. Who's that? - Who's that? - Nobody. - Tell me! - Shut up. - Tell me! - Shut up! Kitamura-san. Is something wrong? No, it's just... Look. It's really well done. How's your family? I was going to talk to you once I'm done with the preparations, but it seems that my dad can finally rest in peace. I see. That's good. Yes. I... hated my father. He was all about his work and barely spoke to me. But... I guess there were a lot things he tried to protect. True. Also... I'm thinking about getting the qualifications. In order to work here. I don't just want to be the cook... I want to be more... Sounds good to me. Go for it. I will. Alright, time to prepare for Nana's thing. Say, Ohno-san. You wrote "getting a job" for your future. I want to go to university after all. Tokyo University of Arts? Yes. Mmmh, I see why you would. Have you been able to contact your family? No. Everyone says your drawings are promising. And I'd love to see you go to such a university myself. I'll earn the money. It's not just about that. I'm aware of that too. It would be great if you could make a living by drawing alone, but after your graduation you'll have to leave the House of Windmills, right? Listen. Try and think it over. Okay? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Nana-chan. Happy birthday to you. Nana, blow the candles! Ready! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Congratulations, Nana! Congratulations! Nana... I'm coming in. Sorry. What's wrong? It's just... At the end of the day, aren't we just pretending to be a family? That's not true. Everyone thinks of you as family. I also think of you... As family or rather... Well, maybe we're not exactly family, but... You're important to me. What's a family anyway? What feelings constitute a family? Wanting to protect each other... Wanting to trust each other... Sorry, I'm not really sure yet myself. "They're in Tokyo." My... family. Kitamura-san told me. But they can't seem to be reached. I think it's likely that they've abandoned me. I want to meet and punch them once. Shall we look together? For your family. I'll help you. Thanks. Let's go back. Ah, so... What brings you here? I'd like a copy of my family register. My student card and ID number. Please have a seat. Hello. Nana-chan is here. What should I do? Understood. Thank you for waiting. ( Her father is dead. ) Ah, Kitamura-san! Riko seems to have a fever. I'm going to pick her up. Kitamura-san? Ah, I'm sorry. I'm getting Riko... Ah, got it. I'm off now. Miyake-san. What have you done? I made sure to lock it. Really. Not that. Why didn't you get rid of it? It's not like that. I just treated them as documents. I'm serious. You have to believe me. Like father, like son. So it's him, yes? - Welcome. - Coffee. Yes, certainly. Anyway, it's not like that part matters that much anyway. You agree with me, right? That's true, yes. The chances for an accident to occur is less than 10,000 to 1. Claiming tens of billions in the name of justice would trouble thousands of people. Any smart person would understand what's the right thing to do. But even that's too much math for those fools. Be that as it may. I was thinking of giving it a try, too. Try what? Being a hero of justice. Hey, Chef. It's hamburger today? Yes. Nice. Smells like home. You know, you really don't have to look for my father. Even if he were to appear now, I honestly wouldn't be able to think of him as my father anyway. As long as you're here, I'm happy. Okay. Don't just say okay. Akashi-kun. Riko got a fever, so you have to do without me. Got it. Thanks. Ah, Kitamura-san. Nana's father lives in Tokyo, right? Why you ask? Well, we went to the city hall together today and now she's kinda different, I guess. Uh-huh. Uh-huh? I'd like to do something for her. Her father isn't in Tokyo. I told you, didn't I? Most of their parents don't come back. But having that ray of hope makes a huge difference. But now that she knows, what...? What do you think will become of her? I'm counting on you. Nana... This ain't right. W-Why? Don't beat yourself up. We have to think about what we do now. Akashi-kun, you stay at the House of Windmills and help them out. How can you be so cold about it, Tomoko-san? If we stop now, many lives are going to suffer. Well, I know that, but... We have no choice but to continue. I can't do without my earnings either. Indeed. ( For Kitamura-san, From Nana ) This is Kitamura-san and this is me. We were raised in the same orphanage. When he got out, he married a woman who worked as a staff at the orphanage. And then... he lost her. ( Recognized as legitimate self-defense ) ( Man kills robber who killed his wife ) And... At that time... He realized that the man he killed had a two-year-old daughter. The remorse was killing him. He said that no matter what he does, he'll never be able to make up for his sin. He's been living a life of repentance. Without knowing whether that's the right form of atonement or not. Ever since... He's been living for Nana's sake. ( Account book in Nana's name ) ( more than $400,000 by now ) Please gather around. For now, we're going to proceed as usual. We have to protect what Kitamura-san left behind for us. It's up to all of us to cover his deeds. Share everything you know. Okay, let's do this. It's not like that. This... What the hell is this? Let go off me! Hey! Let go off me! Hands off me! How did this happen? Yes, hello? Did you read the documents I sent you? - Yes, we did. - When are you going to publish it? I'm sorry, but we're not going to publish it anytime soon. What? Wait a second. Bye. Come on, walk! Stop! I'm coming! Get a move on! What's so bad about giving people work? There's plenty of people here. Yes. Lots of reporters. Yeah. Yes. Huh!? What's your problem!? You want them to take us all in!? Bullshit! It is believed that this group has been transporting stolen cars to Pakistan and the Middle East on a regular basis. According to the police, they also dismantled... Akashi-san! Call for you! - Who? - Someone called Miyake-san. Good. Okay. Yes? Akashi-san? It's me, Miyake. You haven't been arrested yet? There seems to have been some kind of leak. I was wondering if you know who did that. I guess you don't. It hasn't even made the news. What do you want? Why don't you return the original copy that you stole? Like hell I will. You're going to lose what you love the most. It's the dirty money that protects it, isn't it? I'm off now! You better think about it. We often came here when you were a child. Where do good and evil stem from? And on which side do I stand right now? What do you think, Kouji? - Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food. Yummy, right? - The chopsticks... - Chopsticks? This is delicious, Kou-chan! It's the same flavor as your father's. It's because you're too earnest, just like him. Don't push yourself. You brought it? Hey, that's not what we discussed. Wait! Hey! Stop! Make it public, now. Now! The reporters and police are busy. My word against a group of thieves. Who do you think they're going to believe!? Hey! Are you a brute or what!? Listen. Right and wrong, good and evil... At the end it's just a logic of numbers. The hell it is! The sense of justice of a single guy who killed himself ain't gonna change shit. It's you who killed my dad! You fucking...! What are you talking about? Your father cornered and killed himself. Your unjustified resentment... Stealing my car, breaking into Kawagami's workplace... Digging up and leaking some old story... I just don't get it! You're causing more trouble than anything. Shut up! Right. Your old man called me the day before his death. What do you think he said? "Please forgive me. I was wrong." That's what he said. You're lying. It's the truth. You're lying. It's the truth! That's gotta be a lie. I'm telling you it's true! Stop lying! Stop lying! Stop lying. Admit it. Hey! Admit it! My dad... My dad...! Did he save anyone by doing what he thought is the right thing? On the other hand, did we who were wrong... hurt anyone? That's how this society was made. You... got it all wrong. Akashi Kouji, a self-proclaimed employee of an orphanage, was arrested yesterday on the suspicion of attempted murder by strangling of Miyake Ryouhei, an employee at Nakamachi Automobile. We have information that, out of personal resentment towards Nakamachi Automobile, he also stole Miyake-san's private car and turned it into money to pay off his debts. According to the police, Kitamura Kenichi, the manager of said orphanage, died under mysterious circumstances several days ago and they're investigating whether there was a possible involvement by Akashi Kouji as well. ( Graduation song "Aogeba Totoshi" ) Good luck out there. If anything happens, contact us immediately. Come and pay Kitamura-san a visit from time to time. Nana... I'm off now. Take care. You holding up? Yeah. What about you? I'm going to Tokyo. I see. Do you regret it? You must have known. About Kitamura-san. And about me as well. I don't know anything. You should have killed me with him. That's what I told Kitamura-san. Say, Akashi. For you... What does right mean? Protecting... the people you care about, I guess. Were you able to do that? Will we meet again? Translation: hpriestsubs @ twitter Credit song: Kiyohara Kaya as Ohno Nana "Kimagure Kumo" (lit. whimsy cloud)
