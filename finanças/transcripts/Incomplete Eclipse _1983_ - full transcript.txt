INCOMPLETE ECLIPSE We're speaking about a partial eclipse, when one heavenly body covers another, but the uncovering phase begins before the complete covering of the distant body by the shadow of the closer one. Girls, you're not looking? Don't you cheat? - No. - Nope. We're moving. It's the last happy moment, I can remember. Now! Girls, come in. Mom! Mom, look! Yay, mom! I'll sleep here. Look! No, it's not your room. Magda, don't act crazy. I remember, I was there for real. I mean it was really me. C'mon, stop it. Mom, it works! Mom! Zuzka! Where are you? Mom? Girls? Girls? - Mom, I can't find you. Damn these blackouts! Or maybe the fuses have blown. Mom, it's me. Mom, what's happened? - It'll be okay. - Where are you, mom? INCOMPLETE ECLIPSE I'll show you the fingers of my hand and you'll tell me how many you see, alright? Rezkova, Marta. 14 years old. Optochiasmatic arachnoiditis. Arachnoiditic adhesions surgically loosened. Atrophied papillae. Within the visual field central, absolute scotoma. The condition hasn't improved after surgery. Aforesaid Marta Rezkova, that's me. Keep looking. Look here. C'mon, hold on. Hold on and look here. Open your eyes wider. More. More. Look here. Now, don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Hold on. Hold on awhile. A little longer. Don't move. Yes. Keep looking. Keep it. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Yes. Do you want this picture for a boy? No, for my mom. And sister too. What about dad? Doesn't he deserve it? We don't have one. Well... Lift your chin. Your mom and sister will be pleased. I expect, you like them, when you make them gifts, huh? Mhm. Now look at my hand and we can start to shoot. Here, at my fingers! Don't scowl. Stay cute. Watch here. Pay attention to my hand! Where are you staring? Look this way. Can you see anything, Marta? No. Last autumn. We played the "Yes or No" game. I was the riddle then. Guess what is on my mind! How is it? You can't ask "How is it?" You've to ask so that I can reply yes or no. Is it well behaved? Well, alternately yes or no. Is it dumb sometimes? Stop it, Zuzana! Sometimes it's stubborn and annoying. Is anything coming, Marta? No. Rezkova! Rezkova! Rezkova! MONSTER Now Marta, your task is to draw a monster. It must be a scary one. An exceptionally hideous creature! Got it? Now let's spin her round to trigger inspiration. Rezkova! Rezkova! Rezkova! SELF PORTRAIT Here, Marta, take this chalk and draw. Rezkova! Rezkova! Rezkova! - Yes, cheer her up! - Rezkova! Cheer her up more! - Rezkova! These are the moments I'm most afraid of. Everyone around knows, everyone sees. I'm the only one unaware. Perfectly captured form! Fantastic piece of art! Add your signature, maestro. I'll remove your blindfold now. SELF PORTRAIT REZKOVA How come I didn't notice that I was loosing my sight? I noticed and I didn't as well. One can't say yes or no. After surgery I see the same as before. Everyone says I've to be patient. Mom! Mom! What? Why can't I attend the ice revue? I've got a ticket. Oh, Zuzana, please! I've got to go to work and Marta... What about Marta? Well, Marta... Don't you understand? - No. Zuzana, eat! Mom! Why can't Zuzana attend the ice revue? You see! I can stay home alone. Great! - C'mon! Everyone kept telling me how wonderful I was, how bravely I bear it. I didn't bear anything. Mom kept assuring me I'll see again. And I didn't doubt it. I didn't fear anything then. It was a beautiful time of sweet ignorance. Aren't you sleepy, Marta? No. You ought to go to bed earlier, even though you don't go to school now. Doctor, Ms. Rezkova is still here. Okay. Make her eyes ready for the examination. You made me really curious. What am I supposed to do? Put your thumbs on your eyes. Cover them. - This way? Press. - What next? - Press more. Rub them a little. Ouch! - Have you got your private cinema? Man, this is a wide screen movie. Colors! Lights! Huh? Damn! It's a usual bad habit. Quite widespread. Children thus induce at least some sensations. Sort of compensation. Lean your head back. Yes. Is your eyesight fine? Mine? I see like a lynx. Take a seat. Sit down. So, man, by this I'll make you experience weak eyesight, residual vision, blindness... as you wish. Any choice? - Choose for me. Look upwards. Expect a cold sensation. Well, to start with something bearable... That's 5/50. Things you're supposed to see at 50 m distance, you see only at 5 m. What do you see? Well... Look out of the window. Cool, right? Mhm, cool. Doctor, can you imagine we've a mom who urges her daughter diagnosed 5/50... Pardon! ... to do figure skating. I'd like to see her own performance being almost blind. Now, its 2/50. And this... is 1/50. - Oh That's almost blindness. And why do you go there? On your own? Do you wanna try more? - I do. Get ready. Movements in front of your eyes. - Damn! Try to get up. That's sick! Now, try to walk, doctor. Hey, wait! Wait! Wait! Pardon! Pardon! Jesus! Do you also feel as if you're losing ground? We don't. I know exactly what he sees. My eyesight was measured the same today. Sit here awhile. Soon you'll be called back in. Is your daughter nervous? Not really. She's a good girl. Actually, I admire how she withstands all this. And is she irritable? If at least I'd know what happened? She was always such a healthy child. Well, we'd also like to get some insight into all these problems. Has she suffered some heavy blow to the head lately? Any concussion? No, she'd never suffered a concussion. You'll get a headache again. Such a dumb boy. He never listens. Troublemaker. Do you suspect concussion? Oh no, forget about it. It's not the cause. It could only accelerate some hidden process. Is there any hope for a cure? Hope... There's some hope, I guess, if those nerves get rejuvenated. But it'd have to happen rather soon. Nurse, bring the girl back in. Come in. Expect to go to a boarding school, miss. Have you ever been to Stare Zamky? I've got a secret. A secret. A secret. No one has a clue. Not even my mom. Marta! Marta, are you asleep? I'm not. I can't sleep. It's not true, I never had concussion. I had. Last March. There's someone guilty of it. I never betrayed anyone. I never disclosed anyone. I never told on anyone. But why should I alone bear the consequences? I should have told my mom long ago. I'll tell her. What if I'll have to stay there? - C'mon, Marta. The doctor clearly said it's just a question of time. Why do I have to go among the blind then? Not to miss out on your school attendance. C'mon, Marta! There are teachers even in hospitals. And please don't forget to record your messages. They'll send them promptly. Zuzana and I will eagerly await them. Will you record the first one right away? Marta, promise to keep in touch! - Of course, mom. Mom? - Mhm. What would you do, if you knew who was guilty? What do you mean by "who was guilty"? I mean, if someone would be guilty of it. Someone being responsible for this disease. Perhaps I'd be able to kill him. ELEMENTARY BOARDING SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN WITH RESIDUAL VISION Are you the girl from Prague? - Yes, she's Rezkova. Don't speak on her behalf. She's not mute. She can carry her luggage. It's not that heavy. I'll warn you of the stairs. Here are the stairs. Count your steps. Sixth stair wiggles. Are you counting? There are twelve in total. .... two... three.... four... I still didn't blame anyone. So far. So, Rezkova, this is your room. Here is a coat peg, the wash basin taps. Right hot, left cold. Oh girls, this is such a mess. Those clothes can't be left up. Don't you have a wardrobe? In the evening I want to find... this place in a civilized condition. Do you get it? Come here. This is your bed. Make the bed for yourself! The girls will help you, huh? - Yes. Dinner is at 6 o'clock. Do you want to help? - Thanks. Man, she has so many things. Man, such a cool sweater! Oh, it's really cool. Hey, try it too. - Mhm. Man, and this blouse! Try those laces. - It'd fit you. Oh, a tape recorder. Exactly the same as we've got at home. Hey, can I try to record something? I'll delete it then. - Okay. Hey, let's sing Niagara Falls. - Mhm. Three... Three, four... On the shore of Niagara Falls an elderly tramp is standing and he recalls his first love. Let's check the record now. An elderly tramp is standing and he recalls his first love. Let's check the record now. You're my sweet, brave girl. Marta, remember: No tears... - Turn it off! - I'm sorry. I had no idea there was anything already recorded. I've asked and you said it was okay. - Give it to me! No tears and no sorrows! Whenever you'll feel sad, remember... me and Zuzana. And remember we love you and we're looking forward to seeing you again. We think of... of you! Hey Zuzana! Zuzana! Now something told by Zuzana. Hey! What am I supposed to say? I don't know what to say, so I'll record a song. Bye! ... my shortest song. Yeah! Time to wake up! The sun is shining. Such a fresh morning. It deserves few nicely timed jumps. Just lightly and softly. Try it. Twice on the left leg, twice on the right leg. Rezkova! Attend a finger test. Third door on the lower floor. Right or left-handed? - Right-handed. - Give me your right then. I'll jab you a bit now. And you'll tell me, if it felt like 2 or 1 needles, huh? Yes. Two. One. And that idiot told me, "I'll enlist my child somewhere else then." I was tempted to reply, "My dear, feel free to enlist your child behind your ear." "Our applicants list is long. We accept even the most hopeless cases." So, how many? - Two. Yes, this jerk thinks he's granting us a favor. Marta, you carry this file to the staff room, huh? Do you know the place? Nurse, what is it for? It's for Braille. A record of your finger's sensitivity. Am I gonna to learn Braille script? - Yes. Do you already know it? Nurse, how long am I supposed to stay here? Only till you're 18. Till secondary school graduation. Hello, I'm Rezkova. Do you hear? Do you hear the sound? Do you hear the wall responding? And now! Now! Do you hear how it looks different? Do you hear? It's a solid wall. Clicking one's fingers is great. There's an echo. Actually, everything is responding. Just learn to solve the riddle. And it's also you giving a signal to others. Thus you all avoid clashes. It says, "It's me! Me! Beware! Out of my way!" It's me! Me! Me! Me! Where? - There. Wrong, completely wrong. Where is it now? - At the door. Wrong again. And now, where? Tell me. At the piano. Okay, at the piano. But where is the piano? - There. Focus on the sound, Rezkova. Where is the piano? In the corner, opposite the window. You see, it's not that hard. And now? At the door. Wrong. Oh, Rezkova! Rezkova! Now? - At the parallel bars. Now, really focus. Hear with attention. Where am I? Tell me. Wake up! Focus on the sound, Rezkova. C'mon! Where? Wake up! What are you doing? Do you perceive me, Rezkova? Tell me! Where am I? C'mon! Tell me! Where am I? Where? Cinderellas! Little doves! Where are you? Heya! Today we've a new Cinderella among us. Karny, don't play with the ball! Take a seat. I hope, you didn't forget. A pea is round. A lentil is flat. Exactly! Get ready, children. I'll start you off. Now! Hooray! So, children, round shapes put on one plate and flat shapes onto the other. Cinderella is calling, "Little doves, little doves, help me to sort it out." Which little dove will help with sorting out? Me! Me! Me! Any tapes to send home? Didn't you make a record? - No, I don't have a tape. Okay. Good. You're doing well. Yes. Nice jump. Who's next? Rezkova. - So, Rezkova! C'mon! Climb up. Faster. There's a pile of sand underneath. Nothing wrong can happen. Such a quitter! You can sit down and try to reach the ground with your leg. It's less than one meter. Nothing wrong can happen. Rezkova! Where are you going? Stay here! How... Rezkova! How dare you! Come back! Marta! Rezkova! Rezkova! Phone call! Hey, Marta! What's wrong with you? Is everything okay? Nothing is wrong. Why? - Because you're silent. Wait a minute here. The director will come in no time. - Okay, thanks. I was sure I'd receive a tape recording this time. And you're still silent. Marta! Halloo! You there? Yep. Why are you silent? What's wrong? I lost the tape. How come you lost it? Prague? Still calling? Halloo! Where are you? Sticking to a wall again? You've been here 3 weeks already and still glued to a wall. Come here. Come and help me. C'mon! Heya! Here am I. Here. Here. Here. Yes, you're here. Yes. Look at me as you wish, but once you'll want someone to find you cute, huh? Upwards! Yes. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Do you want to stick to the wall like a jackal all your life? Come on. Just few more steps. Here. Here. Here. Yes. And now jump! When I tell you, it's okay, take it for granted. Don't you trust me? I don't know. Jesus! Use your head. Do you think I want to see your broken bones? What are you waiting for? Nothing. It's too much! Look, girl! Whilst you depend on others, you can't be so distrustful. After becoming self-sufficient, you can send us all to hell. Then it's okay. Look! I've found an old toy at home. A yoyo. Do you know it? Mhm. - It can estimate the depth. You've to exercise. Try it. You see? Less than one meter. Now you'll jump, huh? Jesus! It's not a jumping exercise. You're learning not to be afraid. Hey, Rezkova! What's your intention? What do you want to achieve with your boycott? You only hamper yourself. Don't you get it? I'll tell you something. Etch it into your memory. We're alone. Everyone lives for themself. The sooner you realize it, the better. Look, Rezkova! You're not the only one I care for. If you won't jump before I count to three I'll push you down. One. Two. Three! Night. The plan for revenge. I didn't lose the tape. Burning. Burning. Still burning. Burning. Hush. Someone's around. Burning. Burning. Burning. Burning. Still burning. Burning. Ow. Marta! Marta, you've to reply. No. C'mon! You must! - Why? - It's "Tell the Truth" game. Speak, Marta! - No. Tell us your secret. Everyone has to tell. - I won't say anything. A secret? Do you have a secret? Will you tell it to me? Hold on to me. I'd also tell you a secret. Do you think they're all asleep? For sure. Do you have those hairpins? Yes, I do. Did you really want to kill yourself? - Yea. Don't you want to anymore? I'm not stupid. And do you think it's life threatening? - Of course, it's the third floor. And what's down there? - Concrete. That's what's cool about it. Where are you? ... the concrete ground underneath. You'll get perfectly pancaked. Last year a railing cracked there, so the place is closed. Look, this shutter you've to remove it by lifting it up. Check it. - Mhm. Here you've to insert a hairpin. Damn! Its got rusted or something? And do you also sort of see wave shapes in front of your eyes? ... while thinking of something. What wave shapes do you mean? I mean, certain colors and movements. Some motions. It happens even if you don't want it. Mhm. It can finally be opened. Look? You never noticed it? No. Now, follow me. Be careful. There's no railing. I know. It's great, huh? Cool, isn't it? Let's go back. I'm cold. Okay, lets go. Listening to this record is prohibited to strangers. It's a secret disclosed only to my mom, Jana Rezkova. Mom, I've discovered the truth. This isn't just a temporary issue, as you tried to convince me. It's a life-long condition. Such a life is not worth living. I've decided to die. No one had the right to fool me. Such a life is not worth living. I've decided to die. No one had the right to fool me. I haven't lied to you for at least 2 years. I only didn't tell you what happened last March. In March, I... I... Leave me alone, Zuzana. Don't catch me! I'm afraid. Leave me alone. Don't catch me! I feel really sick. My head is spinning. Leave me! Leave me! C'mon! Zuzana! No! No! When I regained consciousness, it became obvious I had no apparent injury. Marta, how do you feel? Does it hurt? Does it still hurt? I didn't want to hurt you. Please, please, don't tell mom. I won't tell. Really? Not even tomorrow? Never ever? What's wrong with you? Do you feel any pain? I felt nauseous. For sure I suffered concussion. Thus I became blind. Guilty is... One. Two. Three. So, children, make sure to hold your cane right. Keep your hand on the central axis of your body. Yes! Next. Forefinger is directed downwards. Yes, this way. Tap gently the terrain from left to right in the width of your shoulder span. Try to walk straight on. Imagine you're walking on the main square in Prague at 3 pm. Pokorny! Hey, Pokorny! This isn't a cabaret show. Go no! Go on! No shirking! Once you'll be grateful for diligent practice. The cane is in front of you and you follow. Yes! C'mon, boys! It's no joke, this a serious practice. You never know when it might be useful. A new person arrived. Research begins. Sensory imagination. Get up, children. We've got a guest. This man is a psychologist from Prague. Sit down. So, behave yourselves! Tell me children... - May I? - Mhm. Psychologists... what do they do? They ask us, "How do you do?" Very well. And how do you do? I'm fine. - Great. I just played a mouth organ. When I was a small boy I perceived that particular sound as if sparkling. Well, it happened by itself. Nothing unusual, huh? - Sure. Prsk! Prsk! As if iron sparkles. How do you perceive this? Not as sparkles, I expect. I perceive it rather smooth. As if... silky... perhaps. How do you perceive it? Oh, Karny! You're not paying attention again. And how do you perceive it, teacher? It's as if metallic. Sort of glossy. Like tiny spirals. Tell me more. Short, long? Thick, thin? I'd say rather short... with a glossy surface. And convoluted. Okay, great. And how was this? Like a radiator. - Anyone else? Sort of hard. What? - Hard. Okay. Like stairs. - Okay, anyone else? - Sort of bumpy. And how do you perceive anger? I mean, real anger. Like a fiery explosion. It's red and very fast. Where? Tell me where? - Here around. This way... What color is a letter L? Light blue. Did you finish the meal? - Yes. Eat more. Who left the chair in the aisle? Who wants to cause an injury? Me. It's unacceptable. Here everything has its allotted place. Otherwise, someone gets injured. Come with me. Watch out for doors. - I know. So... how do you do? Tell me? I don't know? "I don't know." "I don't know." Don't tell me "I don't know". One has to know how he feels. Listen how it sounds. Listen! "I'm fine." "How do I feel?" "I feel well." "I'm okay." "Neither overlord, nor priest can enchain me." Did you always have that lively imagination. Tell me! Why? Yeah, great question... "Why?" One should always ask "Why?" Because all this preoccupies my mind. Why do you perceive anger as if hot? While another person perceives it hairy, and third one black. And fourth has no clue what I'm talking about. Now you should ask "Why?" again. Why? You see, this question always comes to mind. So, tell me instead what's the highest mountain of Australia? Kosciuszko. What? Kosciuszko. Kosciuszko. Mount Kosciuszko. You know this worthless information. But you've no clue how you feel. Or do you? Do you? - No. So, now we'll put this issue under investigation. Okay? Deal, boss? Give me real hi five! C'mon! Yes! Did I topple something over? Who cares? Nevermind. Nevermind, boss! Now, say aloud, "Me!" Me. C'mon, it's too low. Say really loud, "Me!" Me. C'mon! What are you afraid of? There's nothing to be ashamed of. Say aloud, "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" C'mon. Where's the hitch? Let's climb up. We're on the highest mountain of Australia and we shout, "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" We're not afraid or ashamed of anything. "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" "Me!" Are you here? Rezkova! Rezkova, pack your stuff. You're going home for the weekend. The worst Sunday of the year. I'm going to Prague. Be careful, children! Hello! Hi Marta! Marta! C'mon Zuzana! Let me greet her too. Mom, Zuzana has my polka dot dress. But you already grew out of it. Last winter you said it was too tight. So, how is it there? How do you get on? Tell us. You've became so secretive lately. Are your teachers also blind? - C'mon! What are they like? Are they kind? C'mon, tell us something! Zuzana! Hey Zuzana! Come out to join us. Mom? - Zuzana, no! I can't! Marta? I've to stay home today. My sister came for a visit. And she's... she's... Where's my bike? Your bike is okay. Don't worry. Zuzana is just learning to ride it. And where is it? - Her own is already too small. So where is it? Zuzana? - Mhm. - Where is Marta's bike? Mom, you know it's at the cottage. Mom? - Mhm. Why is she like this? Like what? So strange! Why doesn't she talk to us? Oh, Zuzana! Do you know how hard it is? Just try to imagine not seeing anything. Mom, mom, look! I became blind. Jesus! Watch out! Missing. They're not there. Not even here. My shoes are missing. Everything here belongs to Zuzana. I don't count with them. They know very well I'll remain among the blind. Sunday. We're going to a concert. Zuzana is excited. Evenings they'll close the door behind me. They'll be relieved of me for a whole month or forever. Zuzana! Hey Zuzana! - Hello! - Hi! Wait for me! I'll put the raincoats in the locker room Pardon! Can you step back! Get out of the way! Marta! Marta! Where're you going? How did you get here? Where is Zuzana? How could you leave her alone? Can you explain it? I didn't leave her. It's not my fault she ran away. Don't lie. Do you have a shred of common sense? Do you have a bit of empathy? - She ran away on purpose. Girls! One of you is lying. C'mon! She ran away. You liar! Do you want to tell me something? No. One, two, three... this is Zuzana's... actually it isn't... mhm... One, two, three... four... five... You don't need to whisper together. I don't spy on you. I'm alone. I don't have any home. Not here, nor there. For sure I suffered concussion. Thus I became blind. The guilty one is Zuzana. You won't see me anymore. Pardon! Oh, we've got a guest! Hello, boss! Are we gonna continue with the research? Love. Don't sleep! I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking. C'mon. Love. I don't know. It's okay, boss. Just don't try to concoct something. Fear. I'm falling, dropping down so fast from a great height. It's all black. Go ahead! It's as if something slumped or tore off inside me. Tell me how? This way! Okay! Okay! Did you ever fall down this way? No. Do you like it at all? I do... really... very much. Do they all have these imaginings? - What? No, they don't. Why? Everyone sees it different. - What? Everything. How come? Everyone has his own truth. Haven't you? Of course you have. Everyone knows everything best. It's pretty normal. Do you know what? I'll tell you a fairy tale, huh? Once there was a king and he had an elephant. Once he heard his sages arguing about the truth. Everyone held a different opinion. The king called for three beggars who were blind. And... the first blind beggar touched elephant's tail and he says, "It's a rope." The other one disagrees utterly, as he touched an ear. He says, "You're such a fool. It's obviously a carpet." The third one touched elephant's leg and says, "Guys, you're both fools. It's without any doubt a pillar." Then they had a fist fight. And this is actually not an elephant, but a mammoth. Just touch his tusks! Well, you see. That's the truth. And now back to our research, huh? Let's check once again. Love. Anxiety. Dread. What type of dread? Well... Whatever type of dread. Dread in general. And what's dread? Well... What do you think? I guess, when one is alone and nobody loves them. No. Really dreadful is when one doesn't love oneself. How come? To be alone is worse! It isn't. When one doesn't love oneself, then it's really obnoxious. Believe me! Compared to this, loneliness is just like a weekend. When one can't stand oneself, one's alone anyway, aren't they? Always! And that's the dread we mentioned before. I don't like myself either. Bounce-jump! Hop! And don't forget we're going to the city of Brno. We'll show them! We'll turn out victorious, huh? But I'll get stage fright. - C'mon! Our report will leave everyone open mouthed. Don't be scared! You'll be the star of the conference. You'll be... yes!... you'll be the number one. Oh, you've got such cool hair. Want help combing your ponytails? - Mhm. Hey, do you get to know what people look like? Of course. How? Touch me. There are other means too. Which ones? Based on voice, by gait and so on. It depends. And how do you think I look? Put your hands down! How can I talk to you without seeing you? And what about me? What "what about me"? You stare sillycow. What? That's a phrase I used as a youngster. It's not fair! You can always look at my face, but I can't see yours. Damn, you are right, I see. What can I do about it? Should I blindfold myself? - That would be fair. Okay, I’m gonna do that. But... I have no scarf. This is it! Long live fair play! The same racetrack for both teams! So. Now I can't see anything. Don't you fool me? Check for yourself, boss! Now, laugh aloud! Keep laughing! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Laugh aloud and exercise, children! C'mon boys, behave yourself! Hey, Pokorny, give me the ball! Keep exercising without interruption! Ha-ha-ha. Rezkova! Rezkova, don't shirk! Rezkova will laugh aloud now. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Why? Why? To engage the diaphragm. Do you have a diaphragm, Rezkova? Maybe. Maybe? Be sure about it! And having the diaphragm, what must we do? We must feel it! Let's keep doing the exercise and laughing aloud! Everyone feels different. What? What's this nonsense? Take it for granted you feel the same way as me. Everyone has their own reason. Oh Rezkova, seems like the doctor from Prague is fooling your reason, huh? Where are you going? Sorry, this isn't a research institute. Here we don't experiment. But I'm not testing a guinea pig. It's just a conversation. It's a game. Well, our curriculum is different. Doesn't she follow it? - She's full of ups and downs. Unfortunately, she is prone to acting impulsively. Nobody scored in my tests as she did. She covered 10% of weight imagery scope. The 10% score is completely unique! I understand you like your research, but I like my job too. Here she's supposed to rehabilitate. - I've no objections! I'm just talking to her. There's nothing wrong with it. There are so many other children here. She is 1 out of 100... out of 1000. So, keep saying this to her often enough to fool and disorient her even more. Watch out! The problems is your point of view is one-sided. The same goes for you! We all have our specific points of view. I'm not sure if you realize these pages contain several hours of research. If you forbid me to finish my study, I can throw all this out of the window. Just take a look for yourself! I'm falling. Dropping down so fast from a great height. It's all black. - No session today? - Go ahead! It's as if... No. And tomorrow? Well, maybe. And will we attend a seminar in the city of Brno? I'll let you know, huh? And what does it means "to act impulsively"? Well, it means... It's a temporal loss of self-control. In other words "to run amok". Why? And... as you mentioned the weight imagery I truly experience it... many times. At times I experience this in my legs, at times in my arms and occasionally within my whole body. Rezkova! Rezkova! Rezkova, come into the office! A phone call! I've no idea, Marta, what's wrong with you. Tell me openly! We've never lied to each other. The head nurse is such a bitch. Who cares? I'll attend the seminar anyway. Without Rezkova? I can't jump through hoops. And what about the cassette? Did you find it? What? What cassette? - Oh, you've forgotten! Yes, I have. - And I kept waiting! Nurses, I've to leave. Bye! Mom, I've to leave. Bye! Marta, listen to me! Zuzka will bring you some apples tomorrow. D'you hear me? Do you hear me? Are you here? - Yes. Do you intend to go to Brno without me? - Just a moment! Who cares if they object? I've a leave tomorrow anyway. No one can forbid me to accompany you. Why do you insist? - Because... just because! Resolution! I'll reveal my secret. The dog-ate-the-sausage, a-little-sausage-in-the-kitchen. He-was-caught-by-a-cook who-hit-him-with-a-wooden-spoon. But what if I'll mess something up? - I'll hit you with a wooden spoon. Normally, I'd be very nervous. But with you I'm not. How is it that I'm so brave by your side? - I've no idea. Sorry. Done! He-was-caught-by-a-cook who-hit-him-with-a-wooden-spoon. All-the-dogs-were-crying and-digging-him-a-grave. Doctor! Can I tell you something? What? A secret. Yep. Don't look at me. I'm not looking at anyone. I'm sleeping. Can I check? Yes. I'm... I'm not really blind. It's just a temporary disease which will fade away. And I'll see again. It just takes time. We use to say f.e. My heart bursts with sorrow. I'm fed up. It's stuck in my stomach. Why? What's the reason? Slide, please. How do we come to this intuitive conviction of our phrases that our body isn't inert to our emotions. This is 1,5 kg of research protocols. Two years of work. And based on them I can already say more than half of the general population can develop sensitivity to a response of the body based solely on the emotion associated with a verbal stimuli. I've encountered hundreds of such subjects. But the most exceptional among them is this girl with residual vision. Marta, can you tell us what you imagine f.e. related to a word "fear". We can't hear anything. Neither can we see anything. You can start to speak, Marta. What am I supposed to say? Speak out as you used to do. How do you perceive fear? Black. In case somebody missed it, Marta replied, "Black". Go on, Marta! Before our demonstrator becomes acclimatized, I'll play a recording. Fear. I'm falling, dropping down so fast from a great height. It's all black. Go ahead! It's as if something slumped or tore off inside me. Tell me how? - This way! Accompanied by a gesture of hands moving towards the abdominal area. A question! How was the testing situation standardized? How? It wasn't. Natural circumstances. How did you eliminate your influence on the examined subject? How would you define "natural circumstances"? - Are all your... Those were natural circumstances of a normal scientific research, doctor. Something you hardly ever ventured. "Many thanks" then! Goodbye! Let's go. Where have you been? Where were you off to? Tell me! Mom said she told you I’d arrive. And you allegedly said you'd wait for me. Like a fool I took such a long journey with tons of apples and you just ran off like you once did from the theater, blaming me. But mom didn't trust you. She knows you're a liar. Can you wait here for awhile, Zuzka? No way! Screw you! I've waited here for hours and I'm not gonna miss my train. Pardon! - Are you leaving? - Yes. - Go on, children. How is your research going? - Don't even ask. And what about trying to investigate some other kid? Here there are plenty of kids. Marta! Marta! Marta! Marta! Zuzka! Huh? Take it! Want me bring something next time? No. Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Me. Well, what can I say? What more can I tell you? Do you remember? Say aloud, "Me!" C'mon! Me! Me! Me! I also... hated myself. I couldn't stand myself. I perceived myself as an idiot. I hated my work... and it seemed to me my research was just worth the price of old scrap paper. Btw. what were you looking for on the balcony? The cassette. What? The cassette. I hid it there. Ah so! And btw. do you know there is no railing there? Huh. Huh? Huh? So, I was sick of myself. I was sick of any research endeavor. I felt like I was only annoying everyone. I considered it all worthless. Well, and... then I found a subject who made me believe it worthwhile. A bit of worth. Are you angry? You don't even know how you helped me? All of a sudden, I started to enjoy my research. Do you believe me? - Huh. Ella hop! The person I was talking about helped me a lot. Thanks to that person I started to see things which I... in the past didn't perceive. Can you guess the person? It's me. Repeat aloud, please! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Thanks! You were really tough! I wouldn't want you as a boss, boss! How do you do? I'm fine. - Great! Keep up the good work! The same to you. - At your command! I'm leaving, bye! Wait a minute! What's up? Thanks. Bye, boss! Who's in such a rush? Oh, it's you, Marta. I... I was... First, she doesn't move away from the wall, and then she's flying around like a hornet. Go on! Okay. But no more rushing around. Go straight to your room. In half an hour it’s bedtime. Where are you going, miss? To Prague. So, get in! Would you hand me the cigars? They are in front of you in a box. Could you light it too? Can you tell me what's the time, please? Take a look! The watch is in front of you as well. Will we reach Prague before 7 pm? So, we're home, huh? - Mhm. Do you need any help? - No. Can you jump down on your own without a safeguard? I can jump. - Aren't you afraid? - No. - Look out! Damn, is it you? Will you stay? - Yes. - Have you got a leave permit? Zuzka, give me the cassette! How come you're here? - Give it to me! What cassette? - The one I use to send. We haven't played it yet. Mom's coming later. Hand it over! - Okay, but I can't see anything. There's a blackout again. OMG, it's 8 pm already? - Yes. Zuzka, find a phone number for the boarding school. Hurry up! Why? - No questions! - Have you run away? - I did. Really? - Yes. Please, hurry up, Zuzana! Look for that phone number! Quickly! C'mon! And what's gonna happen? They'll probably declare me a missing person. To be broadcast nationwide? Really? Damn! Hush! I lost the flashlight. It turned off. Wait a moment. It's here, beneath the chair. Next to the bookcase. I can't find it. Search more to the right. It hit the couch. Yes, you're right. I've got it. You're cool. 0-4-3-1-2-6 Hey Marta, I've found the cassette. Are you mad? Don't destroy it! Are you crazy? The cassette won't work anymore! You've gone nuts! Give it back to me. - Zuzka! Zuzka, who's there with you? It's me. - Hallo! This is the boarding school. Who's calling? C'mon! Hallo! Speak up! It's me. Who? Who's there? Hallo! It's me. Me. Me. It's me again. THE END
