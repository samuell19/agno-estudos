They can admit you any time. Let's go eat something. We came to this hospital a lot when Mom was sick... Yeah, that's right. My doctor's the same as Mom's. Dad... Yes? How long... do I have? Love on Sunday: Last Words Dear Dad... I'm sorry. Don't worry. There's someone I want to see. I'm going to visit him. Hello? Nagisa? It's been ages! Three years. - Since you moved... - Yeah. - How old are you now? - 17. 17, huh? And you're 26. Is your dad here? No. Just you? I'm flying solo. What happened? Nothing. Can I stay? This is my last chance before college entrance exams. Do you mind? No problem. Good. Thanks. Come in. Here I am! Dinner's ready. It's so nice to be back... But I never thought you'd be living here alone. My folks were just going to leave the lot vacant. So I said I'd live here. Wasn't the new house better? Nope. I prefer the house I was born in. It's got memories. Yeah... Bon appetit. How are your mom and dad? They're great. They're putting in flower beds. My sister's had a baby, so they're full-time grandparents now. Yeah? This is good. I'm sorry about last year. Not coming to the funeral. That's ok. Mom was in hospital three months, and I went there every day. She told me lots of things. How she met Dad, even how he proposed to her. And about when I was born. And I wrote down lots of recipes to cook the way she did. I filled up two notebooks so I can make anything now. It's good you had that time together. Yeah. Were you there at the end? Just when they wheeled her into the operating room. Oh. This is good! Damn right! Where do these go? In there, at the bottom. - Here? - Yeah. Okay. Can't you sleep? No. So where to tomorrow? Places. Where? Oh, the park, the light-house, the mountain... The shrine? I went there already. I saw a cat die. A cat? Yeah. Maybe a stray... If it were a pet, you'd think its owner would be looking for it. They might not realize till it didn't come home. Why not? They say you never see a cat's last moments. When a cat knows its time has come... it leaves its owner and looks for a place to die. It goes off and dies alone. I wonder why... Me, too. My grandma told me that. We could go see. Why? Someone should bury it. Oh. Here goes... It works! Yep. - Want some watermelon? - Sure. Hang on... I'm done. Its owner took off one night and left it. I've fed it a lot. "Here lies Mike" This vehicle collects large-sized refuse. If in your yard or garage you have an unused...

Didn't you always want to go to sea? Yep. I wanted to be a ship's captain. But when I got on a real ship... I got seasick and threw up. I couldn't swim, either. So there was no way. I almost went to Tokyo, too. To do what? Anything. Anyway, this job will do for now. I don't mind it. Thanks. Sometimes I'd like to save up and move on, though. - Hop in. - Yeah. The hut's still here! Yep. You used to come here and study. While you read comics. Let's eat. Do you always make lunch? No. Sometimes I buy it at a convenience store. Here. Thanks. And there. Okay! But it's amazing... What? People throwing out fans and air conditioners they could still use. People throw things out when they get old... or when something minor goes wrong with them. But most things can be fixed. And people buy them who don't care about design, or that they're old. Come to think of it, you fixed my bike once. You have a good memory. I was really happy. I think it's good to have a feeling for old things. It doesn't pay much, though. What did you used to say you wanted to be? When you grew up... What? It's a secret. What? A kindergarten teacher? Nope. School-teacher? Nope. As astronaut? No! What was it? Relax. I'll be right back. Okay. There. It's working. Thanks. Madoka might come back. Just five seconds. Wet the back of this... Hey! Why, you...! Quit it! I mean it! Don't! It's cold! Stop it! Stop it! Give it back! Wait! Hey! Come on! Stop it! Jerk! I'm all wet! That's enough! I mean it! Look at me! I might leave tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah. Stay awhile. You've come all this way. I've done what I came to do. You're doing fine. I wanted to see you again. Fickle, aren't you. That's right. Like a cat. You fought with your dad... Huh? You'd always come over here when you fought with your folks. Did something happen? Nothing. Oh? If... If I died, what would you remember about me? Are you planning something? Like suicide? Of course not! There are dying people who want to live... I know that! Yeah, you would. I only mean 'What if'? 'What if', huh? That's hard. I can't imagine it. You're only 17. Younger than me. But I guess I'd remember the taste of your curry best. And when I pushed you off the slide and you got a concussion... and they called an ambulance. Or when you hid in that drawer and fell asleep. Gee... What? That's all... Are you really going? I don't know. You are fickle. Let's go drinking. Huh? Come on. Let's go for a drink. Where? Go where? Somewhere good. Here. Someone's playing tonight. - Hello. - Good work. Nagisa... Oh, so you're Nagisa... Eriko, the owner. Hello. Take a seat. Satoshi! Hey, it's been a while. So you've come from Tokyo... Yes. The town's much the same, huh? Yeah. Some things have changed. Yeah? What will you have? Wine. You sure? Yes. Hi. Hello. This order's ready. Tell me... what was Satoshi like when he was a kid? Just like now? I don't know the new Satoshi. And I forget the old one. There. White wine. Your voice... You're the voice on the truck. Yep, that's me. You've got a good ear. Sorry... - Here. - Thanks. The name of that light-purple flower... The one who taught me it... was you. Times of uncertainty drive me mad. When for an instant you go far away... what are you thinking? When the revolving seasons make the flowers bloom... what gives them color is your memory. Mama... Madoka! Are you awake? What's wrong? I'm hungry. You are? I'll help out. Hold on for a minute, ok? I'm almost done. Take her home. You don't mind? Okay, thanks. No problem. - Sorry. I'll be right back. - Yeah. Nagisa? What's wrong? I just need some fresh air. Oh. I'll walk home. Hey... Yeah? You can stay longer. Uh-huh. If you've got something to say, go ahead. I'm thinking... of getting married. To her? Yeah. She's already married though. Nothing I did ever seemed to end up anywhere. Everyone I know had found something... and I was spinning my wheels. Then she said, 'Just do whatever it is you want to.' And suddenly everything was so much easier. Oh. My folks don't want to know me, of course. What do you think? I think it's fine. I thought you'd say that. I'll see you. We'll go to the Festival... In kimonos? Sure! I'm back. Hi. It's been a while since we slept like this. Yep. I used to sleep in your room. That's right. Hey... stay for awhile. When you moved away, you said... you'd be sure to come back. I did? I remembered when Dad decided to knock down this house. When I moved out of the new place and started living here... he said I'd be lost by myself. That made me want to all the more. So stay here. Treat the place like it was your own. If your dad comes you can hide in the shed. Your hand. Let's hold hands. Oh... Okay. We used to do this. Remember my hand, okay? "Make sure you eat, ok?

I liked it when Grandma was alive and we were all together. She died? Yeah. I see. My mom died, too. Last year, from something called 'cancer'. 'Cancer'? Yeah. So I'm going to die soon, too. You're going to die? Yep. I've got the same thing as my mother. Come winter, I might not be here. Cause you'll be in Heaven? 'Heaven'... Would you like to go see your Grandma? Let's hold hands. Don't let go. We're going to Heaven. Okay. Is Madoka there? I can't find her anywhere. No? Could you ask Ayumi for me? All right. Thanks. Hello. It's hot, isn't it? I'm thirsty. Milk, please. There. Well? Where could she be? Let me stay a little while. Sure. Have you seen Madoka, The girl who was here last night? She's gone. No. He might have her. He's never just gone off with her before... I'll go check. Take over here. I'll go. This is my problem. It doesn't involve you. Yes, it does. Keep out of it. Madoka's important to me, too. She's your daughter. I'll go. Where are we going? Go back inside. Stay here. Get real! You mess with my wife, then come waltzing in to see me?! Huh? You don't have... any right to be telling me anything! Stop it! Stop! Nagisa! - Stop it! - I'll kill you! Satoshi, hurry! Come on! Let's get out of here. What do you know about being a father?! What's is it? Are you ok? Nagisa? What's wrong? You're okay? Yeah. I'll bring some water. Sorry, I've got to go. You rest up here. Call me if you need me. Madoka... Wake up. Let's go. I don't want to go home. But your mom's waiting there. She's worried. Let's go. Will I see you again? Sure. Promise me. Cross my heart... and hope to die. I promise. I won't tell Mama. I'll say I was playing alone. Bye-bye. Hi. I made dumplings. Let's eat. Do you realize what you did? Why did you take Madoka? What did you want with her? Just like you've got your life, I've got mine, too. Don't come back here. Go away. Are you stupid? Falling for an older woman is stupid. You should be ashamed! You said it was okay. I lied. You just want her because she's someone else's. That's not true. She's cheating. She's getting a divorce, for me. Not for you. For her! For me! Think that if you want. I'm happy for you. You don't know a damn thing about it. She'll do the same thing to you! Don't you realize that? You're wasting your time! Go home, already! You'll be sorry. Divorcing to marry never works out. She'll get a new life, and she'll get rid of you. Go away! Cheating is disgusting! Cheating sucks! It sucks! What do you know?! Tomorrow won't always be there. Don't you see you're wasting time? You're just being carried along! You can do anything if you try! Ignore what's right in front of you, and nothing will ever change. Just letting time go by... or going away somewhere... won't change anything. Live so you won't be sorry! I want you... to like yourself, and to live in a way you can be proud of. Then bring me a beer, Madoka. Okay! He was worried about Madoka. They're playing. When will you get divorced? If not for Madoka, I would be now. But when I see how happy she is with her dad, I'm not so sure. I don't love him at all, though. Can you tell Satoshi that? Of course not. Isn't that what you call messing with someone? Yeah... I know I shouldn't be doing it. I don't know what he sees in someone like me. Sure you do. The only reason you want him is because you're lonely. You're not fair. Satoshi thinks he knows what's going on. It's so easy for you. Satoshi knows that you're married. That you have a child. It's cheating, but he's decided it's pure love. He's an idiot. When he went to see your husband, I was embarrassed for him. You two won't work out. I thought the same way when I was your age. How so? I thought everything was either good or bad. I thought you mustn't do bad things, that you shouldn't live that way. But there are things you can't help. You never know what another person is feeling. I've got no idea how Satoshi might change from now on. Nothing is certain in this life. Well, I guess a child is the only certain thing. When Madoka disappeared, I felt in my bones how precious she was. I felt that all along, but it really came home to me. About Madoka... I'm sorry. Hey... when you're of legal age... let's have a drink. I wanted... everyone to be unhappy. Dad? I'm sorry to worry you. How are you? I'm fine. Good. Know where I am now? Where I was born. I see... The park you used to take me. Where you met Mom. She told you that? Yeah. There were fireworks and watermelon. This is where you proposed, isn't it? That's right. I wanted that, too. Did you see who you wanted to? Yeah. Dad... now I've been in love. Nagisa? I son of know now how a cat feels. Sorry? It doesn't want to make someone it loves feel sad. If you don't say 'goodbye'... you still live somehow in the other person's heart. That's why cats just disappear. Nagisa... I don't even make a good cat. I wanted to be deep in love with someone, like you are. What? It's true. I'm glad... you came. Hey, I just remembered what you wanted to be... A bus-tour guide. Correct. Thank you very much for traveling... on this bus today. Allow me to help make your trip today an enjoyable one. I am your guide. My name is Nagisa Ninomiya. How do you do. To my left here is Toyohama Beach. I have watched this ocean ever since I was born. It's not like this during a typhoon. It's scary then. But I love this ocean. I'd have watermelon here. You would break one open with one blow... but I couldn't hit them right, which made me unhappy. Fireworks, too. I was afraid to light them, so I'd get you to do it for me. I loved to watch them go up... but the pinwheels scared me, because they could go anywhere. On my right is my primary school, Toyohama Elementary. In Grade 1, for writing 'flower', I won my first-ever prize... in the Calligraphy competition. On Field Day I passed three people in the relay... and came in first. Beside it you see Kazemachi Park. We used to have barbecues there. The meat was good... but the smoked ham and cheese you made... tasted just great. This street is the road I took to middle school. When we moved... I... rode down it... in the car as we went to Tokyo. That day I learned that someday you have to say goodbye. I learned... that there are some things beyond your power to change. I wanted to stay. For the first time I realized how important to you... are the people... you expect will always be with you... and the things you expect... will always be there. See you. Yeah, see you. See you.
