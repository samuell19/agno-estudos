It is a great day for the Palestinian people and its national goals. ﻿when it constitutionally elects its second Legislative Council. ﻿I thank my brothers and sisters, members of the Council. ﻿for their vote of confidence ﻿I address and salute those members of the Council ﻿who are behind bars. ﻿in Israeli prisons and detention centers ﻿together with thousands of heroes, the best of our nation ﻿I promise that we shall spare no efforts, until they are free. ﻿and I want to see every member of the Council take his rightful place here. ﻿and every prisoner, receive his proper position in the Palestinian society ﻿In the? name of the Merciful Allah, first of all. ﻿we must stress that the people who are currently imprisoned. are leaders of the Palestinian people, whether political. ﻿military, or social leaders ﻿Ultimately, the Palestinian prisoners represent the whole range ﻿of Palestinian movements and therefore they arc the real leaders. ﻿No cease-fire, no surrender ﻿The resistance continues ﻿No cease-fire, no surrender ﻿While the prisoners remain behind bars If there is a political party in Israel bold enough to move ahead ﻿and recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, ﻿then we would like to hear more in the nearest future... ﻿14 new members of the Palestinian parliament ﻿are imprisoned in Israeli jails. 9 of them are Hamas members. ﻿The government will decide how to react ﻿to the developments in the Palestinian arena. ﻿We have agreed that the election date announced by Mr Ruhi Fatuah. ﻿former Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, will be July 17 ﻿On that day I received a message from the Central Electoral Committee. ﻿which said We are not ready to hold elections on July 17. ﻿I chose to postpone the elections, which caused a great commotion ﻿I said I would publish a flyer and after it's been agreed on. ﻿we'll have elections to the Legislative Council next January. ﻿This corning January. ﻿My name is Abed Alman’am Osman Mohammad Tuamma. ﻿from Tulkarm. I'm serving a life sentence. ﻿for killing a collaborator. ﻿I'm Baher Mohammad Mahmood Bader, a resident of Ramallah. ﻿I've been sentenced to 12 life terms ﻿I'm 28 years old. ﻿I participated in two terrorist attacks. ﻿The first was dispatching a suicide bomber to a bus stop in Zrifin. ﻿and the second, planting a bomb at the Old Bus Station in Tel-Aviv ﻿I'm Fa'ik Mabhuh, from Gaza. ﻿Jebaliya refugee camp ﻿I've been sentenced to 15 years. I've spent 14 years in prison. ﻿and next year. God willing, I'll be going home. ﻿I'm Rajaa Alkaraki, from Hebron. I'm 28, and I belong to Hamas. ﻿I've been sentenced to life in prison, and I've been here for 5 years now ﻿Fuaz Mahmood Ah Nasser, from the village of Dir Kadis, near Ramallah. ﻿sentenced to 36 years ﻿I've been charged with dispatching a suicide bomber, or preparing a bomber ﻿for an operation in Jerusalem ﻿I've sent two bombers, one to the Hillel cafe and another to Zrifin. ﻿My name is Sharif Naji, I live in the Ramallah area ﻿I've been sentenced to 4 life terms in prison. ﻿I'm Ad'al Khalil Hamad, from Han-Yunis. ﻿Sentenced to 17 years, got 5 years left to serve ﻿I'm a Hamas man, charged with abetting wanted men. ﻿Open up ﻿We are in Beer Sheba prison, block 7. Cell number 7. ﻿Welcome, guys.. ﻿I'm Ad'al Khalil Hamad. 33 years old. ﻿married and father of 2 boys. ﻿Ali and Mohammad, 11 and 12 years old ﻿And here, as you can see . The brothers that share this room with me. ﻿I'm Fa'ik Mabhouh. from Gaza. ﻿From Jebalya camp, to be exact. 35 years old. ﻿sentenced to 15 years. ﻿I've served 14 and I have one year left. ﻿I was charged with indirectly Killing a traitor, a collaborator. ﻿Life in prison is exactly the way it is outside. ﻿as far as the organizations. ﻿All the inmates were arrested for belonging to an organization. ﻿They're all known people, whether from Hamas or Fatah, etc. ﻿We're all here for one reason only: we're all freedom prisoners. ﻿What we did, we did to liberate our land ﻿and create our own country, like any other country or nation in the world. ﻿So the organizations operate in the same way within the prison. ﻿There are separate fells. Hamas in one coir ﻿Fatah in another, PFLP in another. ﻿Every organization lives its own life. ﻿But we are all Palestinian prisoners, whatever organization we belong to. ﻿Within the prison, we can be viewed as a single body. ﻿This is the only opening for ventilation. This is a window. ﻿It's covered with a metal sheet, so we can't look outside ﻿They claim it's for security reasons What is there to see, anyway? All you can see beyond this is the prison, with more prison cells. ﻿Here you can see the television. We have television here ﻿You could say that the TV is our only window out. ﻿We watch the 3rd Israeli channel. ﻿We also have the Israeli Channel 2. ﻿and the Palestinian channel, but with interference ﻿We hope that the picture becomes clearer after the elections... ﻿The situation' will be clearer, more.. ﻿Manageable. ﻿An inmate, as the years go by... ﻿First cot all, when he is working on the outside. ﻿organizing things or engaging in military activities or whatever. ﻿he's constantly busy with his work. ﻿He doesn't think politics... ﻿He just follows orders. ﻿But after he's imprisoned, with time, he learns about it. ﻿through television, newspapers or books that he reads ﻿It affects him in a certain way. begins shifting things in his mind. ﻿Many prisoners go through a change, as the years go by. ﻿The Israel security service does such a good job. ﻿that the whole military, political and social leadership is here ﻿The Prison Service currently hold 10,000 security prisoners. ﻿it's a significant number. ﻿This is the key problem that affects the entire Palestinian society. ﻿their prisoners, and I accept this. Every home is affected by it, it either has someone in prison, or had before. ﻿or will have one in the future ﻿I was arrested in 1984 for the first time ﻿and then released when the Palestinian Authority was established. ﻿I did 8 and a half years in total. ﻿After a while, different prison administrations found ﻿that having a responsible leadership within the prison. ﻿an informed, experienced and capable leadership ﻿is better than not having such a leadership. ﻿especially in the Central Prison in Gaza, ﻿which they always kept clear of leaders and important figures. ﻿There were escapes and cases of contraband smuggling. ﻿Many of those incidents affected the credibility of the prison warden and of the chief security officer of the prison, so after a while they found ﻿that it is in their interest to keep the leadership ﻿within the prison, to maintain order. ﻿What's up? Is Haled down yet? ﻿As usual, permits for the holiday. ﻿You probably give them an extra 15 minutes of visit for the holiday. ﻿We'll consider it ﻿We'll see how it goes at first, and consider it -In addition to children ﻿Letting the children in ﻿It's important, you know. ﻿Yes, the children.. What you've got a permit for. ﻿is that inmates who exhibit good behavior, get to see their children ﻿for the last 10 minutes of the visit. ﻿That will not change. That will stay the same. ﻿This is anew privilege given to you by the Commissioner. There won't be any additions to it ﻿I think that the conditions in this aspect. ﻿10 minutes of visitation with children under 6. are alright ﻿It's acceptable, but if in honor of the holiday, they could be given. ﻿Say. if someone had visited with his child, or the child visited him. ﻿40 or 50 days ago. there are 10 days left till the next visit Then maybe you won't insist on... ﻿Alright? -We'll talk about it later. ﻿Thank you very much, goodbye. ﻿Welcome. Please, please. ﻿I'll tell you where the prisoners draw their power from. ﻿All our countrymen. ﻿or at least two thirds of us. have been in prison. ﻿so we've all met each other, one way or another ﻿We all know each other. ﻿If a certain prisoner, like Abu Naji here, is released after 27 years ﻿and if he submits his candidacy for the Parliament. ﻿all prisoners will support him, and all prisoners have friends. ﻿they all have families, and can exert influence. ﻿In other words, the State of Israel has. unwittingly, given him the power. How long have you been in prison? ﻿Were you politically active before that? ﻿I was a contractor, I worked for a living. ﻿and then I joined our organization, the Fatah. ﻿I was in Lebanon and in Syria, and it was very different from today ﻿If you said you belonged to a certain organization, like Fatah, for instance. ﻿you went to jail. ﻿If you raised the flag, you went to jail. ﻿The world has changed, and so have I. ﻿I focused on politics. Don't forget. I study at the Hebrew University ﻿It has its effect ﻿I study International Relations and Political Science ﻿We also learned from the Israelis how to establish a state. ﻿how the Israeli society functions. ﻿When you are an inmate in prison, 24 hours a day, ﻿you focus only on politics, only on the news ﻿I start my mornings with reading the Israeli newspapers. ﻿I listen to the Israeli state radio, I listen to the morning news. ﻿Same thing in the evenings, day in and day out. ﻿You become an expert in what's going on between the two nations. ﻿on where you need to exert influence how to find a solution. ﻿where to turn... Both sides are marching, and neither knows where to. ﻿It's mutual destruction, neither side gains anything from it. ﻿We usually see the Palestinian world through gun sights. This is the firs time we have an opportunity ﻿to really understand the... The reasons for the struggle. ﻿Beyond that, when you are ﻿you sit face to face with murderers. ﻿who have committed the worst acts of terror in the history of the country. ﻿and they're here, behind bars. ﻿but you learn about the discipline and their organization. and the way they lead their pant of the struggle, which is legitimate. ﻿as far as they are concerned, but very offensive to us ﻿From the moment they enter the prison. ﻿the discipline and hierarchy is fully military in nature. Very strict. ﻿No one makes decisions independently. ﻿Each cell block has its spokesman. ﻿working vis-a-vis the prison administration. ﻿but there are others, who operate behind the scenes. We know most of those who work behind the scenes. ﻿The elections to the Palestinian Authority in East Jerusalem... ﻿While the cabinet ministers were debating. ﻿the police arrested Hamas political activists. ﻿I would like to stress that the Israeli occupation forces ﻿are conducting large scale arrests in the West Bank, ﻿and have arrested hundreds of members of our movement ﻿You can not achieve a true ceasefire. ﻿you can not have true peace, ﻿as long as the issue of prisoners remains unresolved... ﻿Hassan Yussuf, one of the senior Hamas leaders in the West Bank, ﻿was arrested today... ﻿Who will win the elections? ﻿Whoever the Palestinian people elect. ﻿And our people, the Palestinian people, are yearning for a change ﻿Three, four, five, six.. Give me a count. ﻿Yuval, give me a count ﻿It should be 16 It's 16, right? ﻿Why are you in prison ﻿I don't know. I'm known as a political activist. ﻿I'm active in the public arena. ﻿They are accusing me of activities in the Hamas movement ﻿It is clear that all of my activities are on the political and public level, ﻿and no other. I mean, at no point did I have anything to do ﻿with the military activities neither directly nor indirectly. ﻿so I am very surprised by my arrest, and I think I was arrested ﻿because of the elections. and therefore I... ﻿Some people of the Israeli Security Services say ﻿that the reason is to prevent Hamas victory. ﻿It was a methodical operation against the people ﻿active in the political arena, and against the symbols of the movement. ﻿I am stunned that a person who is active in politics. ﻿very distant from anything else, is being arrested! ﻿Where is the freedom? ﻿Where is the democracy? ﻿In a country like Israel, that claims to be the only democratic country ﻿in the Middle East... Where is this democracy? ﻿Allah answers those who pray to Him. ﻿Allah is great ﻿I want to ask this question now. I have a right to ask this question. ﻿I ask. why are you afraid of Hamas? ﻿I want an answer from the Israeli side. We are human beings. ﻿We treat all human beings ﻿In wartime, anything can happen. ﻿But when there is dialogue. ﻿when there is a debate, when there are ongoing negotiations. ﻿things change completely. ﻿I estimate that nations have no alternative. ﻿regardless of the stage of the struggle between them ﻿There is no other option except negotiations and co existence. ﻿This is Dr. Ibrahim Abu Salem. ﻿He is under arrest. All of these, except this one and this one. ﻿are under arrest. 7 out of 9. ﻿Most of the interests of Abu Ubeida lie with the news. ﻿newspapers and political news. ﻿because he specializes in political science ﻿In our discussions. I tell him that the Hamas candidates ﻿must be academics, widely accepted by the people His ambition is to serve not only the members of Hamas, ﻿but the entire Palestinian people. These are the Ramallah candidates Dr Hasan Yussuf is under arrest ﻿Ahmad Mubarak. Abu Malek. ﻿is not under arrest. ﻿Fadel Hamadan is under arrest. Sheik Fadel Hamadan is under arrest ﻿Mahmoud Alsoulah is not under arrest. ﻿Are there other prisoners you know, that might be Hamas candidates? ﻿The truth is that until now.. Do you want to release them' ﻿If they want to release them, we'll reveal their names ﻿For now. lot's leave them anonymous ﻿Number 1 on the list, Ismail Haniya, was in prison. ﻿He was sentenced to 3 years. He's been deported in the past. ﻿Abu Tir. number 2, 25 years in prison ﻿We've got as many as 13 candidates in prison. ﻿Most of our candidates, and all of the prisoners, have academic degrees. They are all leaders, all educated That is the difference ﻿In conclusion, I can say that the British regime ﻿is completely stable. ﻿And it is mere stable than the French one. ﻿And the British regime wasn't subjected to the kind of problems ﻿that the French had to deal with in the past. ﻿Rousseau preached to universal will And asserted that the will of a citizen ﻿is the will of the masses, and the will of the masses is that of the citizen. ﻿Since the will of the masses is the will of the citizen. ﻿should the citizen forego his own will for the sake of the general will? ﻿I study Israeli Government and Politics at the Hebrew University. ﻿I have an M.A. in business administration. ﻿I am ready to finish my Ph.D. ﻿in Political and International Relations. ﻿I studied at the Emory University. ﻿I got a specialization in biomedical engineering ﻿I was a student at the Open University, Al-Kuds, mathematics major ﻿I'm a university student, I study Political Science. ﻿I attend the Hebrew University. I study Political Science. ﻿I'm a senior at a university, about to get my BA in Social Sciences. ﻿Maher, hold this door ﻿You study the Middle East inside the prison, too. ﻿Introduction to the History of the Middle East in the Modern Era. ﻿We are prohibited from studying in Arabic We are allowed to study only at the Hebrew and Open Universities For this reason, everything is in Hebrew ﻿In the past, a student would pay his tuition out of his own pocket. but after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and its offices ﻿and the transfer of international funds, with the consent of Israel ﻿The government transfers the funds to the prisoners, so the funding goes ﻿through the Prisoners' Office. ﻿This is one of the most sought-after books around here. ﻿A Thousand Hebrew Words It's for studying Hebrew ﻿I study Hebrew using this book, with the help of brother Abu Ubcida. ﻿may Allah reward him for his kindness. ﻿I'm at Lesson 12 already. ﻿This is so I could talk to the prison guard or the police officer ﻿who lets us out in the yard, or takes me to the infirmary. ﻿or to talk to the doctor. ﻿In this cellblock, for instance. I have Fatah prisoners. ﻿about 30 men from the Fatah who can't write ﻿Over 30 can't write Now they're studying. ﻿They study here and when they are released, they have a diploma, ﻿they've got something! ﻿When I was arrested, I was 14 and a half. ﻿I didn't do well at school and didn't know how to write. ﻿I didn't know anything But in prison I learned everything. ﻿When I was sent in as a suicide bomber. I was 15 ﻿I mean. I was a 15-year old kid at the time. ﻿Kids of this age all over the world sit in front of the TV ﻿and watch educational programs or cartoons ﻿We sat in front of the TV ﻿and watched the slaughter in Jenin, we saw the heroic martyrs die ﻿all over the West Bank and Gaza ﻿When you see this, you feel you have a duty ﻿Everyone, your brothers, your father, your mother and your sisters. ﻿everybody has this duty, it's like a tax that goes along with this land ﻿The symbol, or the mam motif of the Jihad, of the sacrifice for our land, ﻿is the suicide bomber. ﻿You turn your bones into fragments that tear the flesh of your enemies. ﻿of those who kill your countrymen, your children and your brothers. ﻿Do you mean you want to go and blow yourself up? ﻿Yes. I do. You don't want to shoot? ﻿No. no shooting ﻿You don't care if it's in Israel, or what the target is? ﻿The specific target doesn't matter, the point is to kill Jews. ﻿Did your thinking change at all since you've been in prison? ﻿Did you start thinking differently, after you grew up? As an adult? ﻿After you are released, will you think differently about your way of life? ﻿They probably think that by imprisoning a person, they re-educate him! They want to change his thinking, but in fact, it's the other way around ﻿At first, everyone says I want to blow myself up. ﻿I want to blow myself up for my people. ﻿But now, before I take revenge for my people. I want to avenge myself. ﻿I'm losing 6 years of my life here I won't waste them for nothing. ﻿Basically, you believe that the struggle of your people is just. ﻿and you show willingness for self sacrifice. ﻿Then you become a warrior. You become a warrior. ﻿Now, following these activities, I was put in prison. ﻿When I went to jail, I wasn't a leader or a commander in charge of anything. ﻿I was 17 years old. ﻿The lifestyle in prison probably. . ﻿I got the opportunity to progress, to read, to use my time effectively. ﻿to learn from more experienced people. ﻿I've learned a .lot.from people with more experience in the struggle. ﻿The prison has contributed a lot to shaping and developing my personality. ﻿the prison has given me a certificate: the respect I get from the people. Today, when you go someplace and introduce yourself. you are proud to say that you were in prison for 8 and a half years ﻿Good morning, girls! A man in the cellblock! A man! There is a man in the cellblock! ﻿Girls, get up, there is a man! A man, girls. ﻿My name is Kahana Said Saidi. from the Jenin refugee camp ﻿I've been sentenced to 13 life terms and 30 years. ﻿I've been in prison for 3 and a half years now. ﻿I was charged with aiding and transporting a suicide bomber. ﻿I'm Amal Faiz Jumaa, from Nablus. Askar refugee camp. I'm 35 years old. ﻿I've been sentenced to 11 years, and I've icon in for a year and 4 months. ﻿I was arrested in connection with a suicide bombing. ﻿I'm in prison for assisting the brothers from the Islamic Jihad ﻿and for belonging to the Islamic Jihad organization ﻿I've been sentenced to 7 years, and it's been 20 months now ﻿In the name of the Compassionate and Merciful Allah. ﻿thank Allah, the Lord of the Universe. My name is Ahlam Aref Ahmad Tamimi. ﻿I've been sentenced to 16 life terms, prison for life ﻿I've been in prison for 4 years. My file ﻿The female prisoners have become leaders. They've spoken courageously with the prison administration. ﻿They’ve also made it a beautiful place a real Garden of Eden. ﻿They've turned the jail into a school and made it into Paradise. ﻿despite the difficulties of everyday life, ﻿but life in prison is basically hard. ﻿I am happy because I am at prison now ﻿I am sad because of my family, I am far.... ﻿I did see my mother just one time, they let her visit me. 41 ﻿But now I am happy. because I introduced to girls ﻿from every places of Palestine. ﻿As I told you, I read more, I look at the world ﻿from a deeper point. ﻿I know something new for mo A out political tilings. ﻿Why? Why are you in prison? ﻿I asked my girlfriend to perform a bombing in Jerusalem. What kind of a bombing? ﻿A suicide bombing ﻿Not myself, my girlfriend ﻿Yes. ﻿I've been in prison for 4 years now I've been sentenced to 16 life terms ﻿The reason for my arrest was.. ﻿The Israelis arrested me ﻿because I executed two operations. ﻿The first operation was a bombing of a supermarket ﻿on King George street, in Jerusalem, ﻿and later, the planning of an operation at Sbarro restaurant ﻿and transporting the suicide bomber who executed it. ﻿I studied Journalism. Communications and Political Science. ﻿and worked in this field. I worked for the Palestinian television. ﻿and if you wanted to ask me about my circumstances. ﻿I had a certain status where I lived. ﻿After my arrest, the Palestinian people got the message of Jihad, ﻿as delivered by Ahlam. ﻿Before that, they knew only Ahlam's political agenda ﻿and Ahlam's practical agenda But since Ahlam entered prison. ﻿they've become acquainted with the hidden aspect of her personality, ﻿the idea of Jihad and the agenda of Jihad. ﻿Headcount, girls ﻿Why is he filming me? ﻿Your destiny is to spend your whole life behind bars. ﻿It's not nice that they film me behind bars. ﻿You are great. Your pictures are always full of expression. ﻿Sad. Sad and moving. ﻿Girls, lockdown in 5 minutes. ﻿If we think logically, we see it happen every day, ﻿because the Israeli side is twice as powerful as the Palestinian side. ﻿There is no balance of power between the Israelis and the Palestinians. ﻿The Palestinian people began defending its lands accordingly. ﻿and I, as a daughter of the Palestinian people. ﻿took part in the defense of the Palestinian lands.. ﻿I defended them with the means at my disposal and to the best of my ability ﻿There is a daily intelligence war going on here ﻿Beyond the lifestyle and the administration of the prison. ﻿where they negotiate with us on a daily basis. ﻿there is also the issue of directing terror acts on the outside. ﻿Directing terrorism from inside a prison accomplishes several goals. ﻿One. liberation of prisoners Most of the instructions for terror we see... They instruct to abduct soldiers, people in uniform, conduct bombings. ﻿Was any of it ever realized? ﻿Yes Unfortunately, yes. ﻿Run through all the cells ﻿All the shields, in single file, a single line behind us, alright? ﻿Shalom -Shalom to you, too, welcome ﻿Every time we search the cells. ﻿we find materials which we know how to classify. ﻿be it harmless things that they write, copy from the Koran. ﻿or letters of some kirod These are not what we call "Launcher". ﻿A "Launcher" is a message communicated clandestinely. ﻿and sometimes we find them in the cells, on the inmates. ﻿They try to send out these "Launchers" in any way they can ﻿We found an inmate who tried to smuggle in a cellphone in a very clever way. ﻿He hid two cellphone inside his body, ﻿and when our equipment found something irregular in his body, the inmate ﻿ostensibly volunteered one of them. ﻿in the hope that the second one will remain undetected in his body. ﻿and he will be able to smuggle it inside his cell. ﻿But we found the second one?too. ﻿Peace unto all the distinguished quests that I love and respect so much. ﻿people who hear me speak from the Negev prison in the desert. ﻿behind the barbed wire and the tall fences. ﻿from tho tents in the intense cold. ﻿I wish you well and send you my blessings and my love. ﻿Compared to all other nations in the world, our situation is the worst. ﻿because of the great injustice? that has been done to us We shall not submit to terror And they call us terrorists! No! ﻿We are not terrorists. We are of the people, we are the people's brothers. ﻿and we are proud to serve as representatives ﻿Dr. Ibrahim Abu Salam, ﻿a doctor of Islamic law and the interpretation of Islamic teachings ﻿The doctor, the candidate for the district of Jerusalem. ﻿speaks from inside a prison in the Negev, the Negev Detention Center ﻿Israel and the Prison Service know that the are cell phones in the prison ﻿Yes, there are. The Israeli Security Service know this, too. ﻿Cell phones were introduced to the prisons in 1995-96, ﻿without the knowledge of the security services, ﻿the Prison Service or the Israel Security Service. ﻿They were brought in in indirect fashion. ﻿The cell phones were smuggled into all of the jails. ﻿but were later confiscated ﻿How does the leadership' within the prison communicate ﻿with the two headquarters, in country and abroad? ﻿Do you expect me to tell you how his works? -In general terms. ﻿No, this is a question that serves the needs of the Israeli security. ﻿therefore no one will answer it. ﻿Israel will not allow the Hamas any foothold in Jerusalem. ﻿and no campaign propaganda... ﻿We can campaign in different ways and by various means. ﻿and all Zionist efforts to affect our existence and popularity. . The list contains candidates who are in Zionist prisons. ﻿The list contains several prominent prisoners. ﻿held in the jails of the Zionist occupation. ﻿Just give me a minute, please ﻿For a month we've been discussing: if Hamas wins, will they negotiate? ﻿Why shouldn't they negotiate? And why should they? ﻿Arc you angry about these things? ﻿In Israel they say openly that they won't negotiate with you! ﻿Why are we always the first to offer negotiations? ﻿We shouldn't behave like this. ﻿You always blame Fatah for this. Hold on a second. ﻿these elections, how did they come about? ﻿If there are no negotiations.. Who do we negotiate with, monkeys? ﻿Do we negotiate with Zimbabwe? ﻿If the Labor Party wins If Kadima wins.. ﻿For example, just yesterday they offered to negotiate. I say this is going to happen on one condition... On what platform? That's the essence of our disagreement, the policy! ﻿The policy can dictate the nature of the armed struggle. ﻿fighting within the '48 borders. when in fact I want the '67 borders ﻿This is the main flaw. ﻿So, some of the Islamic movements, with the new policy... ﻿Instead of going to the settlement near you, you'll do a bombing in Tel-Aviv ﻿This is our main flaw. We want the '67 borders, so let's fight for that. ﻿So why do they call I lamas a terrorist movement? ﻿If they attack a settlement... ﻿they won't call it (a terrorist movement) Why bomb Tel-Aviv? ﻿None of us enjoy killing! Or killing for the sake of killing! ﻿No one resists because he feels like it. He does it for a cause. -Exactly ﻿You say you want a state within the '67 borders ﻿Is Israel prepared to give you a state within the *67 borders? ﻿In my opinion, the prisons provided the best opportunity ﻿for creating a cadre of Palestinian activists. ﻿It was reflected in the nationwide struggle for the occupied lands ﻿Because under the occupation it was impossible. ﻿The security situation did not allow building an organization. ﻿I his security atmosphere did not exist, but it existed in the prisons ﻿These activists in the prisons, or the detainees. ﻿got their spurs, were shaped, trained and taught wisely. ﻿to become a better movement. ﻿It reflected the situation in Gaza, the prisoners that were released. ﻿were the nucleus of the new organization in Gaza. ﻿We arc a democratic body We've got a decision-making process We are split into, let's say, 3 or 4 centers of power We have the leadership in the West Bank and in Gaza. ﻿we have the leadership abroad, and the prisoners leadership. The opinions of all four of these groups are taken into consideration ﻿in every decision (concerning the elections. ﻿Within the prisons, the organizations remain as they were. ﻿Every movement conducts its own internal elections. ﻿After that, they elect the general committee of the prison. The general committee elects the general spokesman. ﻿the elections are field by a secret ballot. ﻿Every person is free to choose, with no outside interference. ﻿The difference from the elections outside is the absence of propaganda ﻿How do the different prison, communicate with each other? ﻿This is a professional secret! ﻿We have messengers, lawyers. We send letters through the families ﻿People meet ﻿and pass our ideas and messages to each other. ﻿By the way, there are elections going on as we speak ﻿Hamas are/holding their elections on Friday. ﻿What elections? No problem. ﻿On Friday our organization is holding its elections inside the prison? ﻿Elections to all the committees We have 4 committees An education committee, foreign policy committee. ﻿administration committee and funding committee, of which I am the head. ﻿Let me give you an example of he does ﻿Every cell has an account book On behalf of every individual prisoner ﻿This is Cell 11 What does it say? What they take from the canteen ﻿It says how much private funds he has, and what he buys. ﻿Everything has a price, and it says here how much it costs ﻿He sums it up, and then the funds of the whole cell are summed up. ﻿I can take my private funds. Let's say he has my 400 shekels ﻿I can withdraw them That's how it works. He holds the total accounts of the entire organization. ﻿for all 3 cellblocks, not just ours. -He's the Treasurer General ﻿He's head of our funding committee in this prison. I tie prison treasurer. ﻿Shimon, you are coming back to 110 coll, right? ﻿Aloni, open up here, please. -Hod on a second, sweetheart. ﻿Sharif. ﻿Hello, hello! How are you? ﻿What's new? -Thank God. ﻿What's going on? -Everything's fine ﻿Is everything alright with you? ﻿Everything's fine. How are the visits? ﻿Alright. ﻿A lot of runs today ﻿16 buses. ﻿For us and for the Eshel prison? ﻿Yes. 16 buses ﻿I don't know, they’ve started already. They’ve started the visits ﻿What about the new visitation room? ﻿I hope they finish it by the end of the month. ﻿No. but it's in its final stages. ﻿They're building one for the families now. too. outside. ﻿A terminal, outside? ﻿Yes, a big compound, with everything, even air-conditioning. ﻿Go, bring something to drink. ﻿I hope they fix it up by the end of the month. ﻿I came... I hold this meeting every week, to talk to them. ﻿Look, Sharif is the mam spokesman ﻿He represents the majority here, the Fatah. Baher is a cellblock spokesman. Adal is the Hamas representative. ﻿So we talk to them, discuss things. ﻿and they are supposed to convey our messages to all the inmates. ﻿of to convey the inmates' messages 'to tho prison administration. ﻿Part of running the prison is running this dialogue. This dialogue has nothing to do with politics or policy. ﻿It's about the matters of everyday life here, within the prison ﻿Go and rest, we'll call you, alright? Did you bring a blanket? You got a blanket? ﻿He wants a blanket. ﻿No, no blanket. ﻿Who did you come to visit? -Who are you visiting? ﻿Who are you visiting? -My father. ﻿Who? -My father How long has your father been in prison? ﻿25 years. ﻿He's been in prison for 25 years now? ﻿Why is he in prison? ﻿I don't know ﻿I came to visit my father -Your father? ﻿How long has he been in prison? -3 years. ﻿And how long is his sentence? -30 years. 30 years, and he's been in for 3 now? -Yes. ﻿Do you know why ho was arrested ﻿Because of the Motherland. ﻿He's a prisoner of the Motherland. ﻿The security prisoners at our facility have family visits. ﻿in accordance with the law and, the procedures of the Prison Service. The family members in question are of the first degree only ﻿A 45-minute visit once every two weeks. ﻿that is conducted through glass partitions. ﻿This woman, her son is an inmate here ﻿She wants to see him through this lattice, not through the glass. ﻿or through the glass and the lattice. ﻿I have diabetes. I have poor eyesight, when he's behind the glass and this. ﻿I can't see him. ﻿At the most, I can tell him, Move away a little. ﻿so I can see you, how tall you are. ﻿The prisoners are the ones responsible for this problem. ﻿because it didn't use to be like this before ﻿But they took babies-, put cell phones in the diapers. ﻿put in all kinds of things that-are not allowed, so they build the partition. ﻿Gama Jewish inmate use a cell phone, yes or no? ﻿If he would call to ask how his child was doing, it would be fine ﻿Hold on. he's asking you a question. He's saying, a Jewish inmate ﻿he's allowed to go visit his parents for a week. ﻿and he's allowed to use a cell phone, but an Arab inmate. ﻿a Palestinian, is not allowed. ﻿It has to do with the small room, and with this... ﻿You know, with a telephone -I know. ﻿Using the telephone they smuggled in. ﻿somebody gave orders to hijack buses in Jerusalem. ﻿so they're not calling to ask about their mother's health ﻿Who's got a visit? Who's got a visit? ﻿Hello, peace be unto you. Hi, how are you doing? No, Mom. ﻿I've got more girls. -I've got this down. -What? ﻿I have another daughter. ﻿Alright, 2 are in right now. You’ve got 10 children. ﻿I wish you well, and let them stay home ﻿How are you today, my dear? Did you miss me? ﻿Give me a kiss. ﻿Are you filming to solve our problem? ﻿Well, if it solves our problem, then we'll talk. ﻿But if it's to present our problems to the world, ﻿to get sympathy, we don't want any filming. ﻿The world is slaughtering us. ﻿The world is slaughtering us, and then wants to give us sympathy? ﻿Our children grow up discriminated and degraded, and so do we. ﻿A sick mother is not allowed to visit her son! ﻿She died before she had a chance to see him. ﻿She died, and her son is in jail and she's not allowed to see him. ﻿You tell this to the world. The Jews and the United Suites are the same thing ﻿Is this the free world, that talks about democracy? We don't want to hear about phony, distorted democracy. ﻿Islam is the solution! ﻿No one talks to them anymore! ﻿Let me hear some applause! -Allah is great. ﻿Come on. Let Allah watch over you. Say hello to all the relatives. ﻿The first years of a prison sentence are the hardest. ﻿although you\can never fully adjust to life in prison. ﻿because a prison is a very hard place. ﻿But in the beginning, every prisoner is still attached to life outside... ﻿He only just left his wife, his children, his parents. ﻿and his connection to the life on the outside is still strong. ﻿That’s why the first year is the hardest on the prisoner. ﻿especially before trial, when he doesn't know what to expect. ﻿He's in an uncertain situation. ﻿My name is Kahara Said Alsaidi, ﻿from Jenin refugee camp. I'm a mother of four. ﻿Sandy, 12. Mohammad, 10. Rafat, 8 and Dumah, 6. ﻿I’ve been sentenced to 3 life terms plus 30 years. I’ve been in prison for 3 years now. ﻿The chargers aiding and transporting a suicide bomber. ﻿These are Sandy, Mohammad Rafat and Dumah. ﻿Now they are at home, with my husband, of course. ﻿Now my husband and their grandmother are home, at Jenin camp ﻿When you drove the suicide bomber to the Jaffa Gate, did you think ﻿that it could separate you from your children, forever ﻿I was prepared to sacrifice anything. ﻿and this was what we were able to do. ﻿Just a second, tell him to wait. ﻿How am I supposed to talk about my children now? ﻿Say how many you.have how they live, how they saw blood and murder ﻿I also did this thing to protect my children. ﻿It doesn't mean I don’t want to live with my children, or don't love them. ﻿On the contrary, I miss them very much, and I love them. ﻿I did this to protect them. ﻿After the bombings on King George street and at Sbarro, ﻿you went back to work on television. ﻿Yes, I came, back and went on working as usual. ﻿I went back to my job on television ﻿and led a normal life. ﻿Did you report the news of the bombing, too? ﻿Did you? -Yes ﻿How? What did you report on the news? Tell me ﻿I reported it as usual, along with the rest of the news. ﻿I said there was a suicide bombing of the Sbarro restaurant on Jaffa street. ﻿On Thursday. August 9. ﻿a suicide action, took place on Jaffa street, at the Sbarro restaurant. ﻿The result: 15 Israelis killed. ﻿Police sources confirm that in the last three days ﻿there have been efforts to prevent a terrorist attack in Jerusalem. ﻿and it may refer to this bombing. ﻿The Prime Minister was also apprised of this warning ﻿We were in reinforced deployment all over the city, but unfortunately. ﻿as it has happened in the past and I hope will not happen again. ﻿we were unable to prevent this terrorist attack. This operation was conducted by a hero ﻿from the Islamic Resistance Movement, the Hamas. ﻿the military wing, the Az-Addin Ak-Kassam brigades. The suicide bomber was Az-Aladdin Almasri, ﻿from the village of Aqaba, in the Jenin area. ﻿But you didn't say how you came by this information? ﻿No. of course not! How could I? ﻿Who chose Sbarro as a target? ﻿I did. It took 9 days. ﻿I studied the place in great detail. ﻿I chose it after I saw the crowds of people ﻿who visit this restaurant. Sbarro ﻿I didn’t want to blow myself up, to perform a suicide bombing. ﻿My mission was to choose the place, transport the bomber, ﻿and plan the operation in general. ﻿The execution was assigned to the suicide bomber, not to me. ﻿I told him to enter the restaurant and have a meal there. ﻿and quarter of an hour later to complete the operation. ﻿This quarter of an hour gave me the chance to get back. Then said goodbye to him. ﻿He went in, crossed the street and went towards the restaurant. ﻿and I went back to where I came from. ﻿What did you feel when you heard the explosion? ﻿You've got to know something. ﻿A suicide bomber has a very special character. ﻿So after the operation, on my way back ﻿and when I heard the explosion. ﻿I didn't think about anything and didn't imagine anything. ﻿except the image of the bomber. ﻿Despite everything, his facial expression was very innocent. ﻿I was amazed by his enthusiasm for this operation. ﻿and his eagerness to pass into the next world. ﻿It's a beautiful thing, to realize a person's dream. ﻿For instance, if there was a poor man, and you gave him a lot of money. ﻿that would make him very happy. ﻿and you would be happy for giving him the happy life he wanted so much ﻿I. in my turn, gave this bomber the life he wanted so much ﻿Didn't you think about the people inside the restaurant? ﻿The children, the families? ﻿No ﻿Do you fool remorse? ﻿Of course not. ﻿I don't regret my actions, and no Palestinian prisoner does ﻿Because we were defending ourselves, so we don't have any regrets. ﻿Why should we? Should we regret defending ourselves? ﻿Should we feel regret that Israel murdered one of ours. ﻿and we murdered one of theirs? We don't regret it. ﻿Today I'm thinking about getting married, having children ﻿and sending them to the front. ﻿He's thinking about getting married, having children ﻿and sending them to fight. ﻿They can die! ﻿Do you want them to commit suicide? ﻿I want to put the bombs on them with my own hands! ﻿He says he wants to put the explosive belts on his children and send them ﻿I hope that when you have children, you'll think differently ﻿He says he hopes that when you have children. ﻿you'll think differently. ﻿Because children are very precious to their parents. ﻿Anything is possible in this life, ﻿but I saw with my own eyes .a mother who said goodbye to her son. ﻿a suicide bomber, and gave hum the weapon to perform Ins action. ﻿I dream of being like her ﻿Do you know how many children were killed at Sbarro? I think there were... Three, maybe. ﻿I think three children were killed in this action. Eight. ﻿Eight? Eight. ﻿To tell you the truth, any Intifada has positive and negative points. ﻿This Intifada has its positive points, too. ﻿It pushed the Israeli forces out of the Gaza strip. ﻿it pushed out the settlers. ﻿and for the first time in Zionist history, there was a retreat. ﻿A little over a year ago Sharon said: Netzarim is the same as Tel-Aviv! ﻿Where is Netzarim now? Gone! ﻿So, eventually, this Intifada has brought us an advantage. ﻿In anything you do, there are advantages and disadvantages. ﻿No doubt, any war brings destruction death, assassinations and suffering. ﻿Isn't that so? And we all wish to be rid of this suffering. ﻿but on the condition that every man has his rights. ﻿The occupation is still there. ﻿We haven't achieved our rights yet. If the occupation ends and our people get their rights . ﻿There's not a single Palestinian who wants bloodshed. ﻿In our religion they tell about a woman who was sent to Hell ﻿for imprisoning a cat. ﻿She gave it no food or water, and the cat died ﻿For this, it was decided that she should go to Hell. ﻿we treat animals this way. ﻿we certainly have more respect for human beings. ﻿It's true, we in the Hamas have this concept that... ﻿Not just the Hamas, Fatah, too, all the Palestinian people. ﻿We don't think about these things ﻿In the beginning of the Intifada it was even banned. ﻿actions against civilians. But you see. sometimes you can't get what... ﻿You can't got at soldiers ﻿The bases are far, they've got troops, guards and so on ﻿People keep guard. they've got towers and all that. ﻿That is why we had to change direction. ﻿If there were.. Truth be told. I'm talking about the whole conflict. ﻿it's better not to talk. But the truth is that both sides shoot children. ﻿ordinary people, civilians. We don’t like it, and neither do you. ﻿Israel has used force against the organizations for years. ﻿against the Palestinian people. And the result? It didn't work ﻿We, too, as organizations... ﻿All this force, what good did it do? ﻿The problem is political, it's not military. ﻿Eventually, we must reach some form of compromise between the two peoples ﻿Nothing else will do. ﻿We read someplace that you said once ﻿that Israel has the right to exist within the 1967 borders. ﻿I’ve retracted it now. ﻿Is Israel prepared to withdraw to the 1967 borders? ﻿Is Israel prepared to establish a Palestinian state in these borders? ﻿I mean a sovereign state, with the right to live normally, ﻿and not a state where life looks like an Intensive Care unit. ﻿I mean a state with foundations ﻿Is there willingness for such a thing in Israel? ﻿If Israel withdraws and wants it. we'll consider everything in its turn. ﻿Peace be unto you. ﻿Are you going to vote? -Yes. ﻿For who? ﻿Dear viewers, welcome back. ﻿In our continuing coverage of the elections to the Palestinian ﻿Legislative Council, the second since... ﻿Hello, The elections in the Palestinian Authority ﻿As many as 1,300,000 eligible Palestinians will elect ﻿their representatives to the Parliament, for the second time ﻿since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority. ﻿As far as what I call "the school of Palestinian learning experience". ﻿the prisons have reinforced this attempt at democracy, ﻿because those who are accustomed to living in prison for years, ﻿are accustomed to rejecting dictates, coercion and appointments... ﻿I'm interested in a leader, and I wart to vote for him, to elect him. ﻿It has become a culture.' and not just imitation This thing has become a part of our culture. ﻿and we can't give it up that easily. ﻿It was certainly reflected in our experience in prison. ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿Well, heard anything? ﻿It's about the elections, too. that nothing will happen. We've talked about it ﻿But there is still the cell inspection thing, who stays and who doesn't. ﻿They're still arguing about it. Let them argue. We'll do what has to be done. ﻿Come, have a drink -No, they're waiting for me downstairs ﻿What is the voting-percentage ﻿High. ﻿In Gaza? This is in Jerusalem. -How high? 50 percent? ﻿They don't know yet. ﻿They estimate that by 7 o'clock it's going to be over 80 ﻿80 percent is a lot. ﻿When do they close the polls? ﻿At 7 o'clock. If there are still people waiting, they'll add another hour. ﻿Alright. ﻿Well, this is democrat: Real democracy. ﻿Alright, see you later -See you. I estimate that in these elections the Hamas movement ﻿will get 27-30 percent, and the Fatah movement, 50-55 percent. ﻿Hamas will get 30-35 percent ﻿And Fatah will get 45-50 percent ﻿Hamas will get 35-40 percent. ﻿And Fatah will get 40-45 percent. ﻿I don't have any results. I don't want... ﻿I'll give you my estimate, then we'll check it out ﻿I say, Hamas gets 35 percent, give or take. ﻿and Fatah gets around 45. give or take 3.4 or 5 percent. I hat's all. ﻿Good evening, this is a news flash. ﻿The Palestinian Central Electoral Committee has announced ﻿that the voting percentage in the elections to the Legislative Council ﻿that took place today in the Palestinian territories. ﻿A sample taken outside the polls by the Bir-Zeit University shows ﻿that the Fatah movement received 63 scats, and the Hamas. 58 scats ﻿in the Legislative Council, which contains 132 seats in total. ﻿The election officials said that these unofficial results ﻿will not change significantly during the ballot count ﻿This is a festival of democracy. ﻿where our people have proven their victory over the occupation ﻿in fulfilling this right. ﻿I thank you and all Fatah members from the bottom of my heart.. ﻿Following are the initial results. ﻿as presented by the Central Electoral Committee ﻿Change and Reform (Hamas), 30 seats for the candidacy. ﻿and for regions, 46. in total. 76 seats. ﻿Fatah, the number of seats for the candidacy lists is 27. ﻿and for regions, 16. in total. 43 seats. ﻿The results are nothing short of an earthquake! The Hamas is in power. ﻿and Fatah moves to the opposition benches! The smaller factions are on their way out... ﻿The Hamas took 57 percent of the seats. ﻿and Fatah retreated to 32.5 percent of the seats. ﻿Fatah was clearly defeated in the territories. ﻿The small factions didn't get a single seat. Hamas also got... ﻿He was told tonight that Hamas was in the lead. ﻿Good job, really. ﻿We expected these results. ﻿I said we'd get 80 percent. ﻿I'm going to Cell 8. ﻿Last night they told me there that Fatah would get 60- 65 percent. ﻿and Hamas, only 30-35. ﻿Guys, act normally, stay calm ﻿We shouldn't hurt other people's feelings ﻿Far from the celebrations at Hamas, the Fatah responded to the results ﻿with a profound shook, and the process of settling accounts among the activist and the leadership, has begun. ﻿The Chairman of the Palestinian Authority... ﻿Instead of taking care of their own problems. ﻿Fatah was taking care of the Authority's problems, ﻿put all of their efforts into the Authority, ﻿gave all of their time to the Authority, ﻿and forgot that thing called the Fatah movement. ﻿Not only that, we also took upon ourselves the responsibility ﻿for an entire nation, for 10 whole years ﻿A responsibility for an entire nation. ﻿We took the fall for all the mistakes of the nation and the other factions. ﻿Now,there is Hamas. They've got the stage all to themselves. ﻿We'll see who they get to put the blame on now. ﻿The situation will improve. ﻿In terms of security and weapons, they'll have control. ﻿The conditions in the territories will improve, too. ﻿the Hamas will work on it, and it'll improve. ﻿There was another thing that caused Fatah’s failure. ﻿and we need to be very aware of that. ﻿The Israeli media and the political decision-makers, ﻿both in Israel and in the US. who put Fatah in the limelight. ﻿They stressed that should the I lamas win, they'll stop the assistance. ﻿and if the Hamas does this, we’ll do that. ﻿So the Palestinians said to themselves: ﻿Should I allow the US and Israel to dictate who to vote for? ﻿Vote for Fatah? No! I will not vote for Fatah! ﻿I. for myself, as a Fatah man. ﻿if it goes like this, will change my vote. ﻿Israel had a role in it, and the fact that they didn't let Abu Mazen... ﻿Abu Mazen, despite the pressures that have been put on him ﻿by the Americans and the Europeans, ﻿let the elections go on as planned, and the people had their say. ﻿In conversations with the prisoners, following meetings ﻿with their visitors... They feel what the situation is outside. ﻿You hear stories. ﻿about the bribes and so on, we saw it in the faces of the families. ﻿They're fed up with the corruption and bribery among the Authority's people. ﻿Fatah men I his also had a great effect ﻿Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that they will not... ﻿I mean, the American intelligence services ﻿didn’t knew that the Palestinian people hate Fatah this much. ﻿Really? I swear. ﻿The occupation is not to blame for everything. ﻿I mean, the occupation should not be blamed for all of our mistakes ﻿These are internal mistakes. ﻿The phenomenon of larceny under the rule of the Authority ﻿caused distrust among the people ﻿It did a lot to bring us to where we stand today. ﻿The thievery, bribery and corruption that characterized the Authority. ﻿They all had their consequences for us, for the Fatal). ﻿People equate the Fatah with the Authority. ﻿Look, I have no personal stake in this I’m in prison. ﻿I've been in prison all this time. ﻿so what kind of a Palestinian Parliament or Council member am I? A Knesset member or a member of Parliament should serve the people. ﻿he should participate in decision-making. ﻿He should affect things. ﻿When you are in prison, your abilities arc very limited. ﻿But we are also a part of... We play a role in the Palestinian politics. ﻿we're part of the organization. ﻿We won't stand by idly and watch the situation from afar, no way ﻿We won't stand by idly and watch ﻿I he truth is that we hope ﻿elected us as their representatives, you understand? ﻿Israel must respect the wishes of the Palestinian people and release us. ﻿especially since there is nothing that requires our staying in jail. I ﻿say what I think ﻿about most issues and most things. ﻿You've seen it for yourself the lawyers... Using the visits. ﻿we keep in touch, you see' ﻿Even though my own case is very simple. ﻿I won't stay in prison for long, since my case is very simple ﻿I don't see the US releasing the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. ﻿to lead Al-Qaeda, because Al-Qaeda suddenly has a country to run ﻿I don’t see the British release any particular leadership, even though eventually they'll have to sit with them at the negotiating table. ﻿﻿Perhaps a leader will eventually rise from among these prisoners ﻿Usually, those who experienced the prison life... ﻿Take the guys who are on the outside, like Jibril Rajub. ﻿guys who were in. Dahlan was in prison here, too. ﻿A lot of these leaders were in prison here. ﻿they got to know the Israelis, and not through gun sights. ﻿and realized that the State of Israel can not be eliminated. ﻿certainly not by terror ﻿I think that the Palestinian prisoners have turned the Israeli jails ﻿into academics and universities. ﻿Basically, this is the philosophy of the struggle. The philosophy of the struggle is that prisons exist in order to punish you. ﻿to discipline you, to drain you. ﻿Our national philosophy, too. sometimes. ﻿is to drain you of your contents as a fighter ﻿I mean, to make you feel you're being punished. ﻿that you are paying the price with your life', with your youth. ﻿The prisoners in general... According to this concept, they build a strategy ﻿in order to protect themselves. ﻿because the struggle between them and the enemy is always present. ﻿If the Israelis found me and put me in this jail. ﻿to suppress me to cause despair, to prevent me from repeating my mistakes. ﻿I need tools to confront this plan. ﻿Blessed be Allah, the Ruler of the Universe ﻿Blessed be Thee for saying in Thy Koran: I have made the night and the day as miracles for you. ﻿My distinguished brothers, when you read this verse. ﻿you see before you an important issue, but... ﻿Many do not pay hoed to this verse nowadays. ﻿The time, ye servants of Allah, the time. ﻿We must make time, before it's too late. The time passes like the clouds in the sky. and some say: ﻿How do I pass my time? ﻿And if we look up the interpretation of this saying, we'll see ﻿that it is a wicked saying, and that the one who says it. is a wicked man ﻿When the Angel of Death comes to take your soul. ﻿you realize you had a lot of time, but wasted it on occasion. ﻿God. I wish you'd let me live some more. ﻿to become righteous and good. ﻿My brothers in faith, we-have no option but to learn from the past ﻿and from the present that we live in now, ﻿to prepare for the future that awaits us. ﻿We must take full advantage of the present, and prepare for the future. ﻿Right now we are in prison and have no idea what fate awaits us. ﻿and what is in store for us. Allah alone knows that. ﻿But we must invest every effort to please Allah, blessed be His name ﻿We must work day and night to become men of virtue. ﻿of respectable and model conduct, ﻿whether in prison or at any other place we might be. ﻿Allah, grant Your forgiveness to the devout Moslems everywhere. ﻿Allah, raise in Your grace the banner of justice and piety and help us ﻿destroy the nation of the wicked, oh Allah, the Ruler of the Universe ﻿Allah, help us voice the words of justice and piety. ﻿oh Allah, the Ruler of the Universe... ﻿My name is Mansour Nasser A-Din, I'm 35 years old ﻿I have 13 years in prison ﻿Nasser Oyus from Nablus.
