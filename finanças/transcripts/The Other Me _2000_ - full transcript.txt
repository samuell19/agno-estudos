CHECK OUT THE YO-YO. WHAT A DORK. THERE'S THE YO-YO KID. OH, MY GOSH. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT IT TO SCHOOL. WILL! HOW'S IT GOIN'? GREAT, CHUCKIE. POSITIVELY GREAT. REALLY? ISN'T TODAY REPORT CARD DAY? YEP. AND ONCE AGAIN, I'LL SHOW YOU THAT THE WILL BROWNING METHOD OF SLIDING BY JUST CAN'T BE BEAT. SUCH CONFIDENCE. I LOVE IT. WATCH AND LEARN, CHUCKIE. WATCH AND LEARN. OH, HI, WILL. IS THIS YOUR LOCKER? MAYBE. WHY? WELL, I MOVED MY LOCKER HERE. I WANTED TO CHANGE MY LOUSY SPOT. SO, WILL, I WAS JUST WONDERING... I MEAN, WITH THE JUNIOR SOCIAL JUST AROUND THE CORNER... SORRY, HEATHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE. I GOTTA GO. WE'LL TALK SOMETIME, THOUGH. DO LUNCH. REALLY? WHEN? UH, SOMETIME. DO LUNCH? WHO ARE YOU, TOM CRUISE? IT'S AN EXPRESSION. IT MEANS, MAYBE NEXT MILLENNIUM. AND AS I GIVE YOU YOUR REPORT CARDS, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO REMIND YOU THAT YOUR SCIENCE PROJECTS ARE DUE IN THREE WEEKS. I GOT IT COVERED. FOR SOME OF YOU THE PROJECT IS VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET AT LEAST A "B," I'LL BE SEEING YOU AGAIN IN THIS CLASS NEXT YEAR. THAT BAD? NAH. IT'S NO BIGGIE. WATCH IT, BROWNING. SCOTTIE DESOTA. MAN, DOES HE HATE YOU! I GET THE GUY IN TROUBLE ONCE AND HE HOLDS A GRUDGE FOREVER. TROUBLE? YOU GOT HIM SUSPENDED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I BETTER GET HOME AND WORK ON MY SCIENCE PROJECT. WHATEVER IT IS, THROW IT AWAY AND DO A REAL ONE, WILL. YOU GOTTA NAIL IT. COME ON. WHO NEEDS AN "A," ANYWAY? UH, YOU DO. VOILA! DOES IT HAVE A NAME? OH, IT'S OAT BRAN WITH SOME VARIETAL TREE BARK. IT PROMOTES HEALING, PEACE, AND TOGETHERNESS. HONEY, WE HAVE NO PLATES. NO, NO. WE DON'T NEED PLATES. THIS IS A COMMON POT. WE ALL EAT FROM IT. IT'S A FAMILY BONDING THING. YEAH, RIGHT. MAYBE WITH SOME GLUE, YOU COULD BOND ME AND GOOFBALL. ALLANA. SO, WHERE ARE WE GOING ON OUR NEXT FAMILY VACATION? I LOVE IT WHEN WE TRAVEL TOGETHER. ANYONE WANT TO SEE MY REPORT CARD? I CAN HARDLY WAIT. UM, ALLANA, THIS IS TERRIFIC. I GUESS IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY. RIGHT, WILL? ALLANA. THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. A "D" IS SCIENCE. AN "F" IN SOCIAL STUDIES? SOCIAL STUDIES, WILL? YOU CAN GET AT LEAST A "C" IN SOCIAL STUDIES IF YOU ANSWER EVERY QUESTION "WASHINGTON." AND THE SAME COMMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. "DOESN'T APPLY HIMSELF." "NOT ENOUGH EFFORT." "NOT TRYING." I TRY. YOU KNOW I TRY. BUT, WILL, IF YOU'RE TRYING, WHY DO ALL YOUR TEACHERS SAY YOU AREN'T? YOU LEAVE US NO CHOICE... WE HAVE TO GO TO PLAN "B." PLAN "B"? I'M NOT GONNA LIKE PLAN "B," AM I? CAMP SPARTICUS. YES! NO! PLEASE! ANYTHING BUT THAT! IT'S A PRISON CAMP! IT'S A HIGHLY RESPECTED SUMMER BOOT CAMP FOR BOYS. IT'S NOT A PUNISHMENT. A SUMMER AT CAMP SPARTICUS WILL TEACH YOU DISCIPLINE AND RESPONSIBILITY. IT'LL TEACH YOU TO PUSH YOURSELF. IT'LL TURN ME INTO A MINDLESS, UNIFORM-WEARING MACHINE. COOL. NO MORE DISCUSSION, WILL. UNLESS WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR GRADES, YOU'LL BE SPENDING THE SUMMER AT CAMP SPARTICUS. IT'S UP TO YOU. SPARTICUS, THE CAMP OF MISERY AND DESPAIR? WHAT AM I GONNA DO? HOW 'BOUT SCHOOL WORK? MAYBE START WITH YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT. I MEAN, APPLY YOURSELF FOR A CHANGE. WHO ARE YOU, MY ANNOYING THIRD PARENT? NO, JUST A GUY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND HIS SUMMER WITHOUT HIS BEST FRIEND. [ Knocking ] I GOTTA GO. BYE. MOM, DO YOU THINK CAMP SPARTICUS WILL STILL LET ME IN IF I CAN SOMEHOW MAKE ONE LEG SHORTER THAN THE OTHER? IT'S A PRETTY CLEVER IDEA. MAYBE YOU SHOULD USE SOME OF THAT BRAIN POWER ON YOUR SCHOOL WORK, HUH? WHATTA YA THINK? SORRY, MOM. ALLANA GETS "A"s, NOT ME. SWEETHEART, I DON'T CARE ABOUT "A"s. I CARE ABOUT EFFORT. AND SO DOES YOUR DAD. HE CARES VERY MUCH. JUST TRY, WILL. THAT'S ALL WE ASK. DON'T HOLD BACK SO MUCH. YOU ARE A WONDERFUL, SMART, TALENTED GUY. LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY. GOODNIGHT, SWEETHEART. "GROW YOUR OWN FUN!" HELLO, SCIENCE PROJECT. "OCEAN PUPS" ONE BECOMES TWO, VICTOR. HYPERCLONING. THE GREATEST ADVANCE IN SCIENCE IN 100 YEARS. WE'RE GONNA BE FILTHY RICH. CONRAD, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY. IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING WE CAN BUY WITH IT. THAT'S RIGHT. SOON WE'LL BE OUT OF THIS MISERABLE PLACE. WE WON'T HAVE TO USE THIS COMPANY AS A FRONT TO HIDE OUR RESEARCH ANYMORE. WE'RE GONNA WORK IN A HI-TECH LABORATORY. WITH REAL WHITE LAB COATS. AND LAB ASSISTANTS. WITH NAME TAGS. GRAPE JUICE? HMMM. YES! "SCIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN THIS MUCH FUN." "THESE PETS ARE SURE TO AMAZE." I'M READY TO BE AMAZED. "THE WATER TEMPERATURE MUST BE MORE THAN 68 BUT LESS THAN 75 DEGREES." PERFECT. 72 DEGREES. NEXT, THE EGGS... DON'T LET ME DOWN, BOYS. MY SUMMER RESTS ON YOUR LITTLE LEGS. OR WHATEVER YOU GOT. WEIRD-LOOKING THINGS. WHERE'S THE STIRRER? GUESS A LITTLE OF MY HAIR WON'T HURT. NOW WHAT? "YOU SHOULD SEE SOME RESULTS WITHIN THE NEXT 48-72 HOURS"? TWO DAYS? OR LESS. CUSTOMER SERVICE. I NEED CUSTOMER SERVICE. [ Ringing ] OCEAN PUP. "YOU PROVIDE THE WATER, WE PROVIDE THE FUN." YEAH, HI. MY NAME'S WILLIAM BROWNING AND I JUST USED A KIT I ORDERED... WAS IT SATISFACTORY? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN I GOT FLASHING LIGHTS AND WATER SPOUTS... LIGHTS AND SPOUTS? OK, MR. BROWNING, LET ME GET MY HANDBOOK. [ Both Screaming ] AAAH! MR. BROWNING, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE HANDBOOK RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR PROBLEM. WHAT?! WELL, I'VE DONE AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH THROUGH ALL OF OUR DATABASES. I ALSO CHECKED THE INDEXES OF EARLIER MANUALS FOR OUR KIT... WHAT?! I EVEN CONSULTED OUR RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE HANDBOOK DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LIGHTS AND SPOUTS. DON'T! NO, IT DON'T. MAYBE YOU COULD DESCRIBE YOUR PROBLEM AGAIN. NO. PUT IT DOWN. NO? NO! SIR, ARE YOU THERE? YEP. I'M HERE. SIR, HELLO? GOTTA GO. LOVE YOUR KIT. BYE. WE GOTTA TALK. FOR STARTERS... PUT THAT ON. NO. NOT LIKE THAT. LIKE... THAT. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE ME. ME? YOU SPEAK? SPEAK? THIS IS TOO WEIRD. WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN, WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? MISS PINKERSON TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN SCIENCE CLASS. "CLONING: THE CREATION BY LABORATORY TECHNIQUE OF AN ORGANISM THAT IS AN IDENTICAL COPY OF ITS PARENT." HOLY "A" IN SCIENCE CLASS! I MADE MYSELF A CLONE! THE GREATEST SCIENCE PROJECT EVER! "THE SCIENCE OF CLONING IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY." YOU CAN READ? INTENSE. MY PARENTS ARE HOME. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. IN A FEW MINUTES I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND SCARF SOME DINNER. SCARF? EAT. CONSUME. IT'S ALL IN THERE. READ ABOUT IT. AND STAY HERE. PUT ON SOME CLOTHES. PUT ON SOME CLOTHES. KEEP QUIET. AND KEEP QUIET. SHHH. IT WAS A STRANGE PHONE CALL. I MEAN, THE KID, HE SOUNDED SO STRANGE. I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH SAYING SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING IN THERE, ANYWAY. I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN RID OF THESE ANIMALS! GAME OVER, PAL. THAT'S IT. OUR SECRET'S OUT. POOF. GONE. GONE TO SOME KID NAMED... WILL BROWNING. THE KID JUST GOT A WEIRD REACTION. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. WHAT IF HE ACCIDENTALLY CLONES SOMETHING? HIS DOG OR HIS CAT? WE DON'T HAVE PATENTS, REMEMBER? "WE DON'T NEED THEM YET," YOU SAID. "NO ONE WILL EVER FIND OUT ABOUT HYPERCLONING," YOU SAID. FEEL BETTER? MUCH BETTER. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE? WE'RE TAKING A ROAD TRIP. WELL, WILL, WHAT'S THE SCIENCE PROJECT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON? I'D RATHER NOT SAY. I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT. HA. DING, DING, DING. THAT MEANS, FOR OUR HOME VIEWING AUDIENCE, THAT WILL ISN'T WORKING ON ANY PROJECT AT ALL. I HAPPEN TO BE WORKING VERY HARD ON ONE. DONE! DONE. WE HAVE A WINNER AND A NEW CHAMPION. AND HERE ARE YOUR PRIZES. A BRAND NEW REFRIGERATOR, A BRAND NEW FREEZER... YEAH, CRANKING IT UP ON THE DARK SIDE IS THE NEW SHAWN PEAK KICKER, WITH HIS LATEST FABLED ADDITION TO HIS MULTI, MULTI-PLATINUM CATALOG. NOW STAY IN THERE, LITTLE BIGBEES. BIGBEE. WE'VE GOT LOTS MORE HITS COMING YOUR WAY. [ Both Screaming ] WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG? UH, NOTHING. I'M FINE. WILL, YOU SCREAMED. SCREAMING IMPLIES SOMETHING BAD. NO, I JUST SCREAMED. A LITTLE. MAY I BE EXCUSED? BEFORE DESSERT? I MADE RUTABAGA POPSICLES. TEMPTING, BUT CAN I GO? HELLO? WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE? WHO'S THAT? THAT? IT'S JUST A MASK. IT'S NOT REAL. SEE? OOOOOH. GRRRRR. IT'S FAKE. JUST PRETEND. FOR HALLOWEEN. IT SCARED ME. I SCREAMED. WHOA. TALK ABOUT SCARY. THE UNDERWEAR GOES IN THE INSIDE. AND YOU GOTTA KILL THE TIE. KILL IT? TAKE IT OFF. LOSE IT. YOU KNOW, I SCREAMED TOO. AT DINNER. WELL, WHY DID YOU SCREAM? YOU KNOW HOW TWINS CAN SUPPOSEDLY COMMUNICATE PSYCHICALLY OR SOMETHING? NO. YEAH, WELL... NEVER MIND. WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THE CLOSET, ANYWAY? I TOLD YOU TO LOOK AT THE BOOK. I FINISHED THAT BOOK. YOU READ THE WHOLE THING? NO WAY. YES WAY. THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF MATTER... INTENSE. ALL RIGHT, TELL ME ABOUT AZURITE. AZURITE. A BLUE MINERAL WITH THE FORMULA Cu3(OH)2(CO3)2. IT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREEN MINERAL MALACHITE, SINCE THEY'VE BOTH BEEN USED AS PIGMENTS AND AS GEMSTONES. YOU'RE A GENUS! NOW WHAT? I NEED TO SCARF. OH, RIGHT. I MEAN, YOU MUST BE HUNGRY, BEING NEW TO THE PLANET, AND ALL. I'LL GET YOU SOME FOOD. IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND. SO STAY RIGHT HERE. WILL? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS? IT'S A PICTURE OF MY FAMILY. AND MY FAMILY? NO. MY FAMILY. ALTHOUGH, IF YOU WANT 'EM... NOW GET BACK IN MY ROOM. I'VE GOT TO KEEP YOU HIDDEN UNTIL I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITH YOU. Allana: YOU BETTER NOT BE IN THE BATHROOM.

I'M HUNGRY. SNACKS ARE BAD FOR YOU. ARE YOU KIDDING? WITH YOUR MOTHER'S COOKING, SNACKS ARE WHAT KEEP ME ALIVE. RIGHT. EXCUSE ME. OOH. OF COURSE YOU CAN. I'LL JUST REHEAT IT. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? JUST STAY WITH ME. WAIT A SECOND. WEREN'T... WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER PUTTING IN THIS FOOD, ANYWAY? UPSTAIRS. MY ROOM. GO. OH, CHOLESTEROL. SWEETHEART... HI, HONEY. WILL? HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE? I... DROPPED A... THING. I'LL BE LEAVING NOW. JUST, UH, EATING SOME... YUMMY LEFTOVERS. YUMMY. IT'S EVEN BETTER COLD. SUCKING UP TO MOM TO SAVE YOUR LIFE WHEN YOUR GRADES TANK? I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. ALLANA, YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM WHAT I'M UP TO. HMMM. ENJOY THAT, HUH? UH-HUH. I GUESS IT TAKES ALL KINDS. [ Burps ] I'M LOSING AIR. THAT WAS A BURP. A BELCH. PERFECTLY NORMAL. YOU'VE GOT NO LEAKS. WATCH... [ Burps ] SEE? ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BODILY FUNCTIONS, JUST ASK. [ Yawns ] WHAT WAS THAT? A YAWN. IT MEANS YOU'RE TIRED. ALL THAT RUNNING AROUND MUST'VE GOTTEN TO YOU. YOU'VE HAD A BIG DAY. WAS IT A BIG DAY FOR YOU TOO? THE BIGGEST DAY OF MY LIFE, SO FAR. EVEN BIGGER THAN WHEN I GOT MY TONSILS REMOVED. THE TONSILS PLAY NO PART IN THE HUMAN BODY. THEY AND THE SPLEEN ARE THE ONLY ORGANS THAT CAN BE REMOVED WITH NO CONCERN. THAT'S WHAT YOUR BOOK SAID. IT'S SO AMAZING. YOU LOOK LIKE ME, YOU TALK LIKE ME, BUT YOU HAVE A COMPUTER BRAIN. IT'S YOUR BRAIN TOO. IT'S GOTTA BE. I'M YOUR CLONE. HEY, WHATTA I CALL YOU? THE OTHER ME? WILL TWO? TWOIE? TWOIE. TWOIE? WILLIAM? [ Knocking ] HONEY, ARE YOU ASLEEP ALREADY? I LOVE YOU, SWEETHEART. GOODNIGHT. SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE ME. I AM SUCH A GENIUS. GET SOME SLEEP, MY FRIEND.

OH, CHUCKIE AND I ARE MEETING HEATHER AND SOME OF THE KIDS DOWN AT THE ARCADE. FORGET IT. YOU'RE STAYING HERE. I'M GOING. I THINK I DESERVE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN TOO. WHY? WHY? WHY? THAT'S WHAT YOU DO ALL DAY IS HAVE FUN. I'M THE ONE THAT DOES ALL THE WORK AROUND HERE. FINE. GO. WHATEVER. LOOK, WILL, I THOUGHT STAYING HOME ALL DAY, EATING JUNK FOOD, WATCHING TELEVISION, AND NOT GOING TO SCHOOL WAS YOUR DREAM. IT WAS MY DREAM. MY DREAM STINKS. $200 FOR THE ICE CREAM TRUCK RENTAL. FIFTY BUCKS FOR A PORTABLE FREEZER. WE WEREN'T DOING SO BAD. WE WOULD HAVE BROKEN EVEN IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO START A SMALL BUSINESS. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT WE DIDN'T GET ANY SPYING DONE. CONRAD, WHEN HYPERCLONING HITS IT BIG, WE'RE GONNA LOOK BACK AT ALL THIS AND LAUGH. MY ISLAND WE BUY WITH ALL THAT MONEY. I WANT A LITTLE RANCH HOUSE, A PICKET FENCE, FLUFFY WHITE PILLOWS. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WHICH PART? LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. DOWN ON THE DRIVEWAY. WHAT'S UP, MAN? Victor: THE BEDROOM WINDOW. ONE THERE, ONE THERE. TWO OF THEM! TWO WILL BROWNINGS! Both: HE'S HYPERCLONED HIMSELF! A HUMAN HYPERCLONE! CONRAD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? IF WE GRAB HOLD OF THAT SPECIMEN AND RUN SOME TESTS, WE'LL BE ABLE TO HYPERCLONE HUMANS. THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF OUR LIVES! NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHICH WILL IS WILL AND WHICH WILL IS THE CLONE. WHY DON'T WE JUST GRAB THEM BOTH? NO. THAT'S KIDNAPPING.
