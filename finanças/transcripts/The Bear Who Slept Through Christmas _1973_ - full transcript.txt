[Narrator] Ever since Christmas began, everyone has looked forward with wide-eyed wonder to its annual arrival. And everyone everywhere celebrates the yuletide season as a time of renewed hope, goodwill, and peace. Everyone, that is, except bears. Why? Well, because bears sleep through Christmas. In fact, from about the beginning of winter until about the beginning of spring, bears do nothing but... [snoring] [snoring] [soft wheezing] [snoring] [wheezing] Did I say all bears? Well, that's not quite right because there was a bear a Christmas or so ago whose curiosity was stronger than his instinct. His name was Theodore Edward Bear. [loud ding] Shh! Ted decided to stay awake and find out for himself what Christmas was all about. This is his story. Patty Bear? He's a Sagittarius. Patty, take a memo. Yes, sir, Mr. Bear, sir. To all employees of the Organic Honey Works-- [clears throat] This year, our annual hibernation will begin at a quarter past December. Period. Honey productions will resume promptly at, oh, say, half past March. Period. Will that be all, sir? Oh, uh, send a carbon copy to the bees. I'll type it right up. Ted had tried to fight tradition before, and he's about to try it again. You can tell by the look in his button eyes. Well, the weather's getting cooler. There's just no doubt about it. And tomorrow it's gonna be downright cold-- 12 below zero in downtown Bear City. I'll have the complete forecast and the rest of the morning's bear news right after this message from Bear-Air. This year, Bear-Air offers you first-class paw space and a variety of vacation hibernation packages-- east, west, north, or south. ♪ You'll fly without a hairy care ♪ ♪ 'Cause Bear is sure to get you there ♪ ♪ So let us make your reservation ♪ ♪ For a soothing hibernation ♪ Get up in the air ♪ Fly Bear-Air right to your lair ♪ ♪ Fly Bear-Air, fly without care ♪ ♪ Fly Bear-Air [razor buzzing] Hey, hurry up, Henry. Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus. Am I tired, Ted. Winter's really getting close, huh? I guess so. Say, Henry, you know that-- Hey, man, listen, not again. Not that Christmas stuff again. Hey, but aren't you even just a little bit curious? I mean, I've heard that-- I've heard that Christmas is really a very special thing with a lot of-- Look, man, this time of the year, I am curious about one thing-- sleeping. Any greater truth I will gladly leave to you... Ted. Well, it seems to me that bears-- they're-- they're really missing something, Henry, and-- Henry. Hen-- Where are you, Henry? [snoring] [snoring] Come on, Henry, or we'll miss the bus. Now come on. Oh, Ted. Are you gonna make a fool of yourself again this year? You tried to stay awake last year, and you went to sleep standing up. And the year before that, remember? You ate all those honey sandwiches. Yeah, but, Patty, I thought those honey sandwiches would give me, um, the energy. Ted, you don't even know if there is such a thing as Christmas. Oh, yeah? Well, what about those stories about the lights and the music and a fat human in, um, a red suit that comes down your chimney, huh? [Patty] Okay, even if there issuch a thing, everybody's asleep. All bears sleep through the winter. Just because other bears always sleep through Christmas, that doesn't mean I have to. Okay, okay, go ahead. Stay awake all winter. This could only happen to a Pisces. Heh heh. And he's got a long, white beard. Ha ha! Huh, Ted? Well, if it is true, I sure wouldn't want some fat red human crawlin' down mychimney! [laughter] Look, man, why don't youstay awake? We'll sleep. You can go find out what Christmas is, ifit is. Aren't any of you just a little bit curious? I mean, what about all those stories? You know those stories. They-- They say if you find Christmas, you'll hear beautiful music. You'll see pretty lights. And there's-- Well, there's-- there's singing and dancing and lots of good things to eat. And-- And they say that you feel really good. Ted! Stop it! Watch what you're doing! Ted! Stop! Hey! Watch out! That stuff's running all over the floor! Oh, no! Ted! Get in here! Why? What possible explanation? I've worked so hard for so many years! I built this plant with my bare paws! Now this. Why? Oh, I, um-- I'm-- I'm sorry, sir. You see, I was-- I was just-- Well, I was...um... See-- See, I got to thinking about Christmas, and-- Christmas? You were thinking about Christmas? While my honey is flooding my honey plant? Now, listen, Mr. Philosopher, a bear must build his life on work! I didn't get where I am by thinking. If I hear one more word about this, uh, uh, Christmas, I'm going to fire you so fast, it'll make your fur curl! You nearly blew it, man. I just cannot understand you, Ted. I mean, you have a college degree. You could be a very successful business bear. I think it's dangerous to mess around with philosophical concepts. And I'll tell you one thing. If Mr. Bear ever hears the word "Christmas" again, he'll fire you so fast. Hi. Which one of you is Ted Edward Bear, please? Oh, no. Averages were down 2 3/10 points today. Another bear market. Our final story tonight is an amusing one about sleep, or the lack of it. While the rest of the community plans to hibernate, one bear,an employee of the Organic Honey Works, plans to stay awake. Ted Edward Bear is going to attempt to find Christmas. And, Tom, we're speaking to Mr. Ted Edward Bear, who says he's going to stay awake all winter to look for Christmas. Ted, tell us, where do you think you're gonna find it? Uh, uh...I really-- I really don't know yet. Well, aren't you afraid that if you do find it, you might not be able to find your way back? Gee. Yeah, I-- I-- Well, I-- See, I have to get there first, and then I'll see, you know. Before you go anywhere, young man, I've got a few words for you. So there it is. While every other bear sleeps, Ted Edward Bear will be wide awake and out looking for Christmas, for heaven's sakes. The Bearwitness Newswent to the Grizzly University today to find out about Christmas. We talked with Professor Werner Von Bear. Well, uh, we don't know an awful lot about this, uh, uh, oh, uh, uh, uh, Chris-- uh, Chrism-- Christmas. It's-- It's a shame. You know, we could put a bear on the moon. We could put toothpaste in a tube, put milk in a cow, but we can't find out about Christmas. Now, this man-- this man. This cute-- this-- this sweetheart in the red suit-- Santa Claus. He's in charge from Christmas. Now, he's still using this primitive means of propulsion. Could you believe it? At this stage of-- He's supposed to go all over the world in-- in-- um-- and, um-- oh, you-- And he does it while everybody's asleep. Ha ha ha ha ha! The whole concept isreally farfetched. Maybe with a government grant, a few years of research, you could find Christmas. But a bear would have to be cuckoo to go looking all by himself. And that's the Bearwitness News. We'll be back with the sports and weather after this message from Bear-Air. I've put up with your philosophizing. I've put up with your spilled honey. But now you've done it. You've dragged the good name of the Organic Honey Works into your foolishness. You're fired! [brakes screech] [snoring] Okay, next. Where to? East, west, north, south, the woods, the mountains, where? The mountains west. Mountains west it is. Okay, next. Where to? East, west, north, south, the woods, the mountain, where? Uh, Christmas. Come again, pal? I said, uh, Christmas. I'd like to go to Christmas. Christmas? Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, folks? We got a bear here wants to buy a ticket to Christmas! [laughter] He wants to find Christmas! [laughter] Look, pal, you can't buy a ticket to Christmas. Christmas isn't a place. It's a thing. ♪ I'm goin' on my bear vacation ♪ ♪ My once a year fun hibernation ♪ [hums sleepily] Oh, next year you've gotta try hibernating up north, Henry, by the river. That's where all the movie bears go. I wonder where Ted is. He said he'd meet us here. [laughter] Oh, no. What'd you do now, man? I just-- I just tryin' to buy a ticket to Christmas. Why, Ted? Because-- Because ever since I was a cub, I wanted to know what Christmas was. And every year, I tried to stay awake and see, and-- and I couldn't stay awake, and-- and be-- Maybe this year, things'll be different. Things won't be different. It's youwho are different. Oh, Ted, they're all laughing at you. Final call for Bear-Air flight 145, vacation hibernation service for Polarville, Forest City, and beautiful downtown Bearbank. Now in the final boarding stages at Gate 11. Well... good luck, man. Goodbye, Ted. Goodbye, Patty. I-- I really wish things could be different. So do I, Ted. [Narrator] And so it was that a very tired Ted Edward Bear set off one winter's day to find out for himself what Christmas was all about. Looking for Christmas isn't the easiest thing a bear can do. But Ted, as tired as he was, pushed on. He was one determined bear. In spite of whatever hardships he might encounter, he was confident that he would eventually find Christmas. [animal howling] [howling] [howling] [panting] [growling] [cracking] Excuse me, sir. Which way to, uh, Christmas? Whatcha hollering about, pal? You see, I'm-- I'm trying to find Christmas. Well!

He won't talk. Well, why not? Been asleep for weeks. Uh, hey, can you help me, then, Miss? Well, hey, what about you, Captain? I just gotta find Christmas before I fall asleep like everybody else. It won't be long now. Christmas is just a few hours away. Few hours away? Wow! That's the closest I've ever come to it. That's why we're half off. You're half off? That's right, pal. On the last night, they mark us half off. I used to be $25. Now I'm only 12.98. If we don't get bought, there's no Christmas for us. It's back to the stockroom instead. To wait another whole year. You mean-- You don't mean that-- You mean Christmas isn't coming here? I'm afraid not. You see, [slowing down] they're shutting us down already. But I-- But I stayed awake so long. Longer than I've ever been able to stay awake before in my life. And I've come so far from home. I just can't miss Christmas now. Then you'd better get out real quick. [slowing down] They're locking the doors right now. They're-- Hey, wait! Hey, don't lock me in! Wait! No! This-- This can't be happening to me. Not to me, not now. Not after I've tried so hard. Someone... please help me! That window. Maybe it's open. That-- Oh, no! It's locked! Yii! Ohh! Uhh. Oh, thank goodness. Oh, thank goodness. Hey, wait! Hey, wait, please! Well. Can I help you, young bear? Uh. Oh, I-- I don't think that anybody can. What are you looking for? You see, I'm tryin'-- I'm tryin' to find Christmas. I heard stories about it, and I know I'm close. But, you know, you-- I'm so tired. May-- Maybe I was crazy for trying to find Christmas. No, you're not. Christmas is a very important thing to discover. Only you won't find it on a map. Then where will I find it? It's inside yourself. I don't understand. Well, you see, Christmas isn't a place or a thing or even a time. It's something you carry around in your heart. It's a way of acting towards others, a way of feeling about the world. Christmas is a way of giving. But, you see, I don't have anything to give. Let me tell you, the greatest gifts that anybody can give are not those presents you buy. And youhave very much to give. I do? You mean-- You mean like your sign says? Something like that. Yeah, but if-- if Christmas is so great, why-- why do they have it only once a year? That, my boy, is something I wish I could answer. Wake up. Wake up. Now, listen. If you can stay awake, I will help you find Christmas. You will? Tell you what. Go down this street about three blocks to number 501. Go up to the top floor. That's where you'll find Christmas. Yeah, but how will I know? You'll know. It'll be everything you ever dreamed Christmas would be. Oh. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. And Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas. This is Christmas? Well, maybe I got the wrong place. Well...I know I'm close, so I'll just-- Maybe I'll just take a short nap, and then I'll go out and look again. Hey. Little bear. Wake up. Huh? Wh-- Oh. Oh. Am I glad to see you. I-- I-- I think must've gotten probably the wrong address. No. You got the right one. You mean I can find Christmas here? Yes, you can.
