- Hello? Hello? It's Pietro over here! Can you hear me? Hello? Over here. Have you got a boat? I'm on my own without a boat. Can you hear me? Abreu! Abreu? Can you hear me? It's Pietro. - Water. Water. What's the date today? - 21st March. - No. Today. It's 6th. - Today is 21st March. What happened with the engine? What happened? The same as in Belize, wasn't it? I knew it, Picciotto's an idiot. I see everything. - I'm on my way. - Pietro. Pietro. Give me... Give me the wrench. To hot-wire the engine. It doesn't have a radiator. It's a go-kart. - Don't worry, Alejandro, I'll take care of it. - Over there. The money is on the table. For Claudia. Give it to her. - Alright. I'll give it to her, don't worry. Come on... Drink a little water. Have a rest. I'm here, yes. I'm here. - Hold this. Are you drinking all of it? - Do you have anything to eat? - It's a miracle you're still alive. Help me with that table. This is my bedroom. You stay there. - You're having me on. There's water there. - Really? There you go. What was your name? Keep this still or I can't do it. - It's burning me. My name's Benel. - Are you from Haiti? I can't do it. - They're made for that. - This is moving. It's moving in that direction. That must be south. Dominican Republic. Over there Miami. Cuba over that way. There are a lot of islands. - What islands? - Many islands, Bahamas, Antillas... With a bit of luck we'll reach somewhere. You know how to swim? - Of course. - Good! We might end up swimming there. Are you the one who stood up to El Chavecito? - It was me. That's why they punished me. - You were lucky. You caught him on a good day. Otherwise he'd have thrown you into the sea. [With God everywhere] - How far were we when it exploded? - I don't remember. Quite far, I think. We were going to pick up people from a few islands. And from there... we were going to hand you over to the Mexican boat. - What boat? The guy who we paid said it would be a direct trip. - That's impossible. It doesn't work like that. You never do the journey in just one trip. You have to distract the police, the patrols. The routes are decided on the day. And the Mexicans... Sometimes they leave you on the other side of the border. The Mexican side. You have to be lucky to arrive. - You're a son of a bitch. You and all the others. I'm glad they're at the bottom of the sea. Hey, Italy. Italy, come and look. Come and see! Look. - Benel! Come over. This seaweed is delicious. Come on! They're really nourishing. You have to eat something, come on. The sea is as flat as a pancake. Hold on to one of these and you won't sink. Floats alone, come on. - I think there's a fish over there. - Where? - I think it's dead. Under the plastic. Further over there. In the plastic bag, look on top. - I've got it. It choked. - What fish is it? - No idea. It's meat. It's really nice. You have to eat. - Go on. Go on! - Have you been to Miami? - Yes. - What's Miami like? - Nice, if you have money. If not, you don't exist. The same if you don't have your papers. And if you're black, forget it. - You don't like black people. - I don't have any problem with black people. I was only telling you how things are over there. - No, you don't like us. I saw it in the boat. - I don't have any problem. In fact, I have lots of black friends. - Really? How many? - Stop busting my balls. I told you I've no problem with black people. It's just that we're different. - Can you see? You're a bloody racist. I have an uncle and six cousins living in Miami. And they're black. I know how things are. - Good. - And I have another cousin living in Portland. And he earns $1000 per week. - That's good money, I'd like to earn that. What does he do? He works in a car park. - Doing what? - I don't know, car park stuff. - It's impossible to earn that amount. - That's what he earns - I don't think so. - Why would I lie to you? How much do you earn? - $400, $500. Sometimes $600, it depends. - Bullshit. You earn more with all of us. - Not me. - I paid $1000 and there were a hundred of us. I don't think you earn less than $500. - I work as a deckhand and sometimes with the engine. I'm not the boss. - You're all the same. I'd rather starve to death a hundred times... before doing what you do. - You should grateful to us. Without us you wouldn't get to the other side. Besides, I don't know why you want to go there anyway. They're always going to treat you like shit. You'll always be second. - You're such an idiot. - Don't you know how they treat black people in the US? - I'd never do what you do. Even if they paid me $1000 per week. - Fuck you. It's a miracle that this is floating. What? - Over there. There's a fin over there. - Where? - Look, over there. - Sharks. A mustering. - What's a mustering? - A couple. - How do you know? - I don't know, it looks like it. - They know we're here now. - Are you alright? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Can you hear those? - Hear what? - Can you hear them? - I can't hear anything. - The seagulls. They are there. They were there. This is bullshit. It's never going to work. Let me know when the fish is on the table. Do you know what all this rubbish means? That we're probably close to the shore. Use the ones with lids. Or they'll fill with water and sink. Tie it on tightly. How many have you tied on? - Four. - Tie them on tightly. Do you know how to tie a knot? Yes? It's important. Even more so because you can't swim. Maybe we'll have to swim. - But there are sharks in the water. - Of course there are. They live there. I'm going to have a nap. - How is it? - Fine. - There aren't any sharks today. - Do you know what that means? - That we're close to the shore. - Exactly. Squalli. Sono belli gli squalli. - What's that? - Sharks. Squalli. There's a film I really liked. About a pink shark that... ate everyone. The pink shark. - What was the film about? - About that. That pink shark... that ate eveyone. Except for a girl. Who was dressed in pink. So it rescued her. It took her to the port... where everyone was waiting for it. As soon as it left the girl... They began to shoot it. They turned it into mush. And the girl was crying. What was it called in italian? â??Alla riccerca dello squalo rosaâ? In search of the pink shark. - Why did you leave Italy? - I don't know. I barely remember. I was looking for something better. Like a lot of people. Like you. I've never gone back. - Do you have children? - No. - Why not? - I don't know. It didn't happen. It's not for me. - I have two. - Two? Are you kidding me? How old are you? - 17. And I have two girls... Leonel y Nivard. I don't see Leonel much because she lives with her Mum in another town. But I do see Nivard. Because she lives opposite my house. - You called a girl Leonel? - Yes. It sounds nice and suits her very well. - I think I have a fever. A little bit. I need to sleep. I'm tired. - How is it? - It's alright. Better. It's hurting a little. I'm going to pour a bit of water on. The sea cures everything. - Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. Hey. Thank you. - They came back today and there are lots. - That can't be right. They didn't come yesterday. - I don't know. Maybe we're drifting away from the coast. Or floating round in circles. - What are you doing here? Don't you have anything better to do? Why are you here? Are you having fun with us? Go somewhere else! Where's the bloody shore? Where is it? Where? Fucking sharks! Benel, come here! You tell them! Fucking bloody Haitian. Where are you going? Benel? Tie this to you. - Pietro! Take this off me. I'm cold. Give me water. That's enough. - I'm going to pour a bit of this on. - Just a tad. - That's enough. Do you hear them? The seagulls? We're close. - One 17th January... la, la, la... you came into the world... la, la, la... with your naughty smile... my precious Leonel. Leonel, I love you... Oh Leonel, I adore you... Oh my love, you're my guiding star... I love you, I adore you...
