DARYL HANNAH: The oceans are the source of all life on our planet. Without healthy oceans, no life, even on land, can continue to exist. Cetaceans, better known as dolphins and whales, have been roaming the oceans for millions of years. Yet in only one century, we have slaughtered many of them close to extinction. Despite some efforts to protect them, human activity has forced these weakened populations to face the greatest danger of all, the destruction of their habitat and food resources. We live on land. They live in the oceans. But we all breathe the same air. We share the same planet, yet only a few of us have had the privilege to meet them unden/vater. Let's share their world for a while and meet these tribes of the oceans, the dolphins and the whales. Cruising through the sparkling waters of the Azores Islands, these sperm whales can reach 60 feet in length and weigh up to 45 tons. They are the largest of all the toothed whales. (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Sperm whales are social creatures, enjoying companionship. They take care of one another and even look after the injured. The females raise their young in nurseries, one female caring for another's baby while she dives into the abyss to feed. The sperm whale, like all marine mammals, must surface regularly to breathe. (INHALING) They also have the ability to dive up to 7,000 feet for as long as an hour while searching for their favourite food, the giant squid. The scars on his head were most likely received during fights with his prey or from an encounter with a jealous rival. Sperm whales once roamed the Earth in vast numbers. They were hunted almost to extinction during the last century, mainly because of the precious oil that fills their huge square heads. This creature, while hunting, used to lead fishermen to squid, thus becoming commonly known as the pilot whale. At only 15 feet, this toothed whale is relatively small. These social creatures live in small, very organised pods and will, in turn, join larger pods headed by one leader. They will blindly follow that leader anywhere, sometimes to their own detriment. When one strands on a beach, the others will follow. Why? We don't know for sure. Sadly, still slaughtered in some places, only about 185,000 pilot whales remain in the world today. They seem to be smiling at us, the spotted dolphins. Of all of the tribes of the ocean, they've become our best friends. (DOLPHINS SQUEAKING) Like the sperm whale, dolphins are actually toothed whales, grabbing and tearing at prey with their teeth. (DOLPHINS CLICKING) These spotted dolphins were grey when they were born and spotless. Very social, they, too, live in pods. Dolphins love to interact with each other. They play, touch, fight, hit and caress. Check this out. Displaying amazingly intelligent behaviour and a wonderful facility for teamwork, these adults have intentionally picked up some algae from the sea floor to start a game. They play for fun, not fighting for the piece but cordially passing it around like a game of catch. One of the great mysteries of the animal kingdom is the spine-tingling humpback whale song. (SNORTING) (SCREECHING) (SQUEAKING) The male humpbacks create eerie, hauntingly beautiful tunes. Are they mating calls to females or warning calls to ward off other males? We don't know for sure. (VOCALISING) These complex communications can be heard from great distances and may be repeated for several hours. (VOCALISING CONTINUES) This graceful and elegant underwater ballet is one of the most beautiful shows we will ever see below the surface of the ocean. The humpback is a baleen whale. Instead of teeth, they have baleen plates that filter food out of the water. They have an appetite to match their size, eating an average of 5,000 pounds of krill and small schooling fish every day. With a life expectancy of 50 years, a humpback whale can reach over 60 feet in length and weigh up to 50 tons. Humpbacks are nomads, migrating to the icy polar waters for the summer where they feed. Summer's gone, they will make the 3 month, 3,000 mile journey back to tropical waters to breed and calve. Today, despite some recovery, the humpback whale is still a victim of human activity, and its future is precarious. The beluga whale lives in the frigid waters of the Arctic. Born grey, they don't turn white until six years of age. (SQUEAKING) It is also called the sea canary because of its bird-like sounds. The beluga is the only whale that can move its head in all directions. This friendly-looking creature can appear to have very human expressions. Human activity has resulted in massive pollution of their habitat and has put some of these tribes in great danger of extinction. The beluga whale may soon become a ghostly shadow of the Arctic, a mere memory. (SQUEAKING) Now, here's a very difficult tribe to approach. Risso's dolphins are fairly large, weighing up to 1,100 pounds. Their battered look comes from the numerous scars that cover their bodies. The older they are, the more scars they have, and over time, their naturally dark grey bodies turn nearly white. They get those scars during rough social play. As belligerent as they can be, these fascinating dolphins will remain in a tight-knit social structure enjoying strength in numbers. (SOOTHING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) In the shallow coastal waters of Florida lives the most peaceful of marine mammals, the manatee. It may look something like a cetacean but this is a sirenian. Manatees, much like dolphins and whales, evolved from land mammals and later returned to the sea. The curious-looking manatees are more closely related to elephants than any other living animal. Despite the corpulent look, their la yer of blubber is so thin that it cannot protect them when the temperature drops. They won't survive in water below 68 degrees, so in winter, they will seek out warm springs. The manatee is also called the sea cow. In fact, it's the only marine mammal that eats vegetation. The manatee's diet causes flatulence. (CHUCKLES) Look at all those bubbles. A manatee calf will live with its mother for five years. They'll nurse from the long teat located at the base of her pectoral fins. Just to keep their bodies warm, they have to eat more than 100 pounds of water plants a day. The 3,000 manatees left in Florida are one of the last surviving sirenian tribes in the world. But for how long? Every day, human development takes a little more of their habitat. Soon, they may have nowhere left to live. The orca, or killer whale, is the king of the ocean. It is the largest of the dolphin family. It can reach 32 feet in length and weigh up to 10 tons. (SCREECHING) They will spend their entire lives in pods as large as 25 individuals. The eldest female will always lead. Mother knows best. This extraordinarily intelligent animal, probably the smartest of them all, exhibits highly sophisticated social behaviour. (WHISTLING) They have their own dialects, varying from pod to pod. They will work as a team, and are able to adapt their hunting strategy when faced with new situations. The orca is the greatest predator of the ocean and will even attack the great white shark. Their frightening nickname, killer whale, derives from the fact that they are the only whales that kill other whales. Orcas, too, are suffering from pollution and depletion of their prey. At the head of the food chain, they have become one of the most contaminated of all the cetaceans. They are slowly being poisoned by the polluted prey upon which they feed. Another tribe losing ground. The fin whale is one of the largest creatures on Earth. Only one, the blue whale, is larger. Looking at these dolphins, it is easy to imagine how big this fin whale is. It can reach up to 88 feet in length, and weigh up to 70 tons. Are these spotted dolphins hunting with the fin whale? After a large school of fish has been herded into a tight ball, many predators appear. The large bait ball of fish is first being attacked from above by shean/vater birds. Now, the spotted dolphins from below. And finally, here comes the giant fin whale, taking its turn. In one fantastic gulp, it takes the entire school of fish into its enormous mouth. Look how the ventral grooves below its mouth have expanded, like a giant balloon, to hold the catch. The water will be filtered out through the baleen plates, and the entire school of fish, trapped inside, will become this fin whale's dinner. They will eat up to 3 tons of krill and small fish each day. Although supposedly protected, the fin whale is still hunted today and is extremely vulnerable. In addition to modern commercial whaling and collisions with ships, the fin whale is now also being impacted by climate change. Indeed, krill, its primary source of food, depends on the cover of sea ice, which is now melting. The common dolphin, creature of legend, art, poetry, from ancient times to the present. Why this mystical appeal? What about these magical tribes so captures the human imagination? (DOLPHINS CLICKING) The clicks we hear are used for echolocation, a sixth sense that allows them to see, so to speak. They use it to detect objects, track down prey, locate one another, avoid predators and orient themselves. They use squeaks as a form of language. These sounds enable them to communicate with each other when hunting, playing or keeping track of their young. Today, common dolphins are still hunted for their meat, and around 300, 000 dolphins and whales die every year entangled in fishing nets. Eight hundred a day. A mother right whale and her baby, nurturing, nurtured, a bond formed over several years. She will have one offspring about every three years and will nurse it with her rich milk for roughly 12 months. The right whale's mouth contains about 250 baleen plates, enabling it to filter tons of zooplankton. The huge, pale growths on the head and the lower jaw, called callosities, are home to whale lice that tint them with white, pink, yellow or orange. Unique formations, their own kind of fingerprint. Looking into the eye of a whale is said to be like looking into the window of one's soul. For the few humans who have come this close, the whale's gaze has provided a moment of true emotional connection. Whalers dubbed this creature the right whale because their entire body could be used. In addition to their long baleen plates and their blubber, they were also slow swimmers, easy to catch, and once dead, kept floating at the surface, so it made their processing easier. Thus, they were the right whales to hunt. Most southern right whales are born dark, but this one is white, a rare occurrence. There are very few right whales left. Southern right whales have shown some signs of recovery thanks to protective measures. However, we can only remain cautiously optimistic about the future of these last 9,000 individuals. As for their cousins, the Northern Atlantic right whales, it is estimated that a mere 300 are left in the world. They are very, very close to extinction. The bottlenose dolphin. This tribe of dolphins is usually nomadic. Sometimes, though, they prefer to reside in one location, like these, swimming in the waters of the Bahamas. Dolphins stick together. Their pods are tight family groups, well-structured, and come with an established hierarchy. (WHISTLING) The remarkable bottlenose dolphins are able to develop and teach their young different individual and group hunting strategies. They can then adapt these strategies to varying situations. They can chase through schools of fish in the open sea or corner a hapless prey against a sandbar. A hungry adult bottlenose may consume up to 30 pounds of fish, squid and crustaceans each day. Their brain is proportionally as large as ours. They communicate with a complex language and, amazingly, have individual signature whistles they use the same way we use names to identify one another. Dolphins, when in the intense throes of passion, become very playful, swim in an agitated manner and mate indiscriminately. It's quite common for the bottlenose to scratch each other with their teeth during courtship and mating. Time to play again. (SQUEAKS) Catch it. (SNORTING) A year has gone by. This female is back in the tropical waters of the kingdom of Tonga. Here, sheltered from predators and bad weather, she will give birth to a beautiful 14-foot baby. This newborn baby is so young that his eyes are still closed. His body doesn't yet know how to stay in balance. Every four minutes, for several days and nights, the mother will gently nudge her baby to the surface to breathe. During this period, mother and baby are extremely vulnerable. Even a big storm can be fatal to a newborn. A few days have gone by. This calf can finally swim and breathe on its own, though it still takes shelter under its mother's large fin. Weeks have gone by. The baby has grown stronger. Its skin is darker. From this point on for about two years, the mother will teach her youngster how to survive in the ocean. Mother and baby will often touch one another in what appears to be a gesture of affection. It will take about eight years before this young calf will be old enough to produce offspring of his own. Will he survive that long? Hope this young calf will grow old enough to sing his own unique and lovely song. Hope his song will not be the last one we hear. Dolphins and whales are one of the Earth's living wonders. Some assume they have the right to destroy our children's heritage. We can stop vandalising and plundering the oceans. We can change our way of life. Make no mistake, it's not too late. If we all join together, we have the power to save the dolphins and the whales, the tribes of the ocean. (GRUNTING) (CALLING)
