[siren wailing] [glass shatters] You in the building, youare completely surrounded. Release the hostages, andcome out with your hands up. You want me to release him? OK, pigs. I'll release him! Where the hell is that SWAT team? [screaming] Somebody get anambulance over there now. OK, pigs. Have I got your attention? I wanna talk to somebody in charge! You got five minutes, or I'm gonna "release" another hostage. [chuckling] Five minutes! [chuckling] Sir, you'll have to back up. CIA. Where's your CO? He's right down there. Lieutenant Wilson, getCaptain Baker on the radio. I want a SWAT team here right away. What's all the commotion? Who the hell are you? Special Agent Graver. CIA? Look, we don't need any feds around here. I got the situationcompletely under control. Yeah, I can see you reallyhave things under control here. So fill me in. What have we got? I don't have to tell you anything. I'm still in charge here. This is a government facility. That gives me jurisdiction. If you like, we can call themayor right now to verify. It's your call. All right, all right. We got at least five armedsuspects, possibly terrorists. Evidently, they were in the process of ripping off the place when a security guard stumbled onto them. We think they're holding four hostages. What a mess. Look, what in there is so valuable that the CIA wants to get involved? That's confidential. - Hey! - Thanks. Wait a minute. Where the hell are you going? I'm gonna have a little chatwith our friends in there. Are you crazy? Get back here. Attention, everybody in the building. This is Officer Graver. I'm unarmed. I'm coming in. Come on up, pig. I'll be here! All right, let's not keep the man waiting. I'm only going to say this once. I want a helicopter fully fueled, now. Anybody tries any shit, another hostage gets it. All right. Just out of curiosity, whydid you have to kill him? To prove a point. Now, get out. Bring me the chip. So what did you find out? What do they want? They want a one-way ticket out of here, and I'm gonna give it to 'em. Tell me something, Mr. Terrorist. Why would your boss, Victor Mahler, wanna break into a topsecret government building? I don't know what you're talking about. Bullshit! You just killed an innocent man. If you don't want to spendthe rest of your stinking life rotting in a miserable prison, you better start telling me what I wanna know. I ain't saying nothing. I know my rights. I want a lawyer. Motherfucker. O Lord, Lord, Lord, we aregathered here today to pray for our dearly departed. Yes, Lord, yes, Lord. To beseech your mercy, Lord,for our poor Brother Gregory. Yes, Lord. He was a sinner, a man of many weaknesses, a man who, over the years,went from one wrong to another. He was a pimp, sold womenup and down the street! He was a pusher, sold dope, marijuana, sold even crack cocaineto little school children! That was our Brother Gregory. Amen. He was a murderer, Lord, shot people down like ducks on a pond. That was also Brother Gregory. But you know, Lord, I knew this man, and deep down, Lord, deep, deepdown, I know his soul was good! That's why I'm begging you, Lord, I'm begging you to allow himinto your heavenly kingdom. Show us a sign, Lord. Show us that you have heardour [inaudible] Show us a sign, Lord! Show us a sign! Everybody down! Get down! Head down. Down! You, down! How dare you! This is a house of God! O Lord! Enough. Check the body. Got it. No, not here! Take him with us. Move it. Let's go! Damn you bastards. I'm glad you believe in God, padre. Because now you're gonna meet him. No! Let's go. Come on, let's go. Let's move! Move! [siren wailing] Great, the cops! What the hell did you do that for? There wasn't supposed to be any killing! Just because you're my brother's bitch don't mean shit to me! Amateurs. Leave the body. Let's go! What? Leave it! Come on! Go, split up! [screaming] [siren wailing] Good morning, partner. Good to see all your years on the force haven't affected your lightning fast reflexes. [chuckling] You've ruined a perfectlygood dream, you know. Not that dream with youand Miss September again. Well, actually, this one stars your mama. Never realized she was so kinky. But of course, she had your ass. Another rough night, detective? Christ, how can you drink that stuff? Only way to start the day. You should try it sometime. Oh, no thanks. [beeping] DISPATCH: All units, 415 in progress. Gunshots reported, 3000block of Wilmont and Annex. Any available units, respond. Well, we're on. Hey, maybe I ought to drive. You don't look so good. Just buckle up. [siren wailing] Shit, are you OK? [helicopter flies by] Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. So Benedetti, this is howyou get your kicks, huh? Kinky, kinky! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. So did you find anything? Well, she's got three different names. Oh, Joe, that's brilliant. She's got three different passports. This babe's a regular James Bond. So what's the deal? I ran all three names. Zip, zero, nothing. According to the computer,she doesn't even exist. Did they find anything else in the van? Just these. Murphy. Murphy, the brass is breathingdown my neck on this one, so I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy, your life is miserable. Now, Murphy, I want you toget some answers for me soon. Now, come back here! Murphy! Let's try one more time. What is your name? The body, I mean, what didyou want with the body? Christ's sake, man, we'regonna be here all night long. Hey, Murph, maybe she doesn't speak English. Maybe you got something there. Parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Come on, lady. This is BS! You know exactly what I'm saying. So why don't you drop the act and talk to me? Maybe we ought to just beat it out of her? Wouldn't I love to, but you'd probably like it. Hey look, sweetheart, maybe I gotta spell this thing out for you. I got five dead cops and a dead priest. Now, I don't know what your thing is, but if you don't come clean and talk to me, you're gonna go down for the whole thing. A bad-ass, huh? Gotta be a bad-ass, huh? Why does it always gotta be the hard way? Take her down. Book her, print her, and gether the hell out of my face! Come on, take off your clothes. You enjoying the show, Benedetti? I mean, can I get yousome popcorn or something? - You're sure she can't see us? - It's a two-way mirror. Not bad. Are you forgettingyou're now a married man? Married, yes, but not blind. I'm not blind, for God's sake. Well, she doesn't look so tough now, does she? You're a little kinky. You should enjoy this. I told Nelson to go extra hard on her. Thanks. Ah, damn it! Agh! Do as I say, if you wanna live. Now, move. Drop the gun. Drop it! Give it up. You don't have a chance. Back off! OK now, just take it easy, huh? Everybody take it easy! I'm putting the gun down. Just take it easy now. You don't wanna hurt her. Take it easy! Stay calm, stay calm. Drop the gun. Put it down, rookie! Hello, Alexa. Drop the gun, or he's dead. OK, let's go on three. One, two-- What's this three shit? Standard operative procedure. You can't handle this, maybeI can talk to somebody else. Somebody else around here?- No, buddy. You're talking to the right man. You just don't understand. It ain't no way in hellshe's walking out of here. Let me try to explain this to you. I got a church that's shot to hell. I got a priest with enough leadin him he could sink a ship. I got five police officers down, dead. You got that? Five police officers! Not to mention two fried terrorists. And you coming waltzing in herewith your "standard operative procedure" and your fancy suit, and you think you're gonna take the bestlead that I got out of here? It ain't no way in hellthat's gonna happen, buddy! Look, you're notunderstanding something, OK? This is a government operation. She's government property now. Look, buddy. I want your name and your badge number. Somebody's gonna hear about this! Special Agent Mark Graver,security number 061321. Now, I'm gonna pick her up in the morning. You have a nice day. Uh-oh. You got that look in your eye again. Yeah, what "look" is that? That "I won't be happy tillI kick somebody's ass" look. Yeah, well, you got that right, buddy. Uh-huh. Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to our humble embassy. [applause] As a charitable member ofthe diplomatic community, Mr. Mahler will donate $100,000to the charity of your choice. [applause] In our native country, victory is the ultimate achievement, andfailure equivalent to death. Our host will award thewinner a purse of $25,000. Gentlemen, begin. He's got that [inaudible]. Let's go inside. Kill him! Come on, kill him, kill him! Hey, I'm so very pleased you could come. And I hope this small tokenof mine will in some way further your cause. You are most generous, Mr. Mahler. Call me Victor. And you know, it's nothing, really. I contribute to manycharitable organizations. It-- it makes me feel good inside. But you must pardon me now. I have other business to attend to. Please, eat, drink, and enjoy the entertainment. Your idea of entertainmentseems to be a bit unusual. In my country, we thriveon the competitive spirit. But now you must excuse me. So, Max, I'm waiting. You have to tell me? I barely got out alive. I don't want to hear that. Where is my microchip? We didn't get it. It's still in the body. And what of Alexa? I don't know. I think the cops got her. You incompetent fool! I give you a simpletask, and you fuck it up! If you weren't my own brother, I'd-- I should have sent Alexa alone. Don't worry, Victor. The cops will never find the chip. Unless Alexa talks. She'll never talk! She'd die before she'd betray me! Of course she would. I want that chip. I want it now! Don't come back without it. You got it. Not so fast, little brother. You fucked up. You know what that means. Wait a minute. You can't. Not your own flesh and blood! Sorry, Max. I won't be accused of favoritism. How would that look? Please, Victor, don't! I'll give you a choice-- your tongue or your eye. It's up to you. No, please. No! If I were you, I'd go with the eye. You'll always have another one. No, no, no! [screaming] [honking] [beeping] You know you've been followed. I was wondering how longit would take you to notice. Don't even think about it. If you behave yourself,I'll take off your cuffs. How about it? Follow me. Good morning. I'm taking her downstairs. Hi, John. I hope everything meets with your approval. You can relax now. Freshen up, take a bath. There's clothes in the closet. You can change. And if you need anything else, we'll know. [door closes and locks] Alexa, you can cut the silent treatment. I know all about you. Surname, unknown. Approximate age, 24. 12 known aliases. Parents deceased. No known living relatives. Born in Yugoslavia, educatedin the United States, specializing in counterintelligence, espionage, terrorism. Expert in hand to handcombat, weapons, demolition. Believed to have been involvedin the overthrow of the Angolan government in September of 1988,led Cambodian revolt in 1989. Remember that? Terrorist bombing Philippines, 1986. Currently in the employ of one Victor Mahler, a small time psychopath makinga play for the big leagues. I'm impressed. [shouting] So why am I here? I was just getting to that. Mahler has been a thorn in ourside for quite some time now. We know who he is and What. He does. Unfortunately, certainly legalities, his status with our government, diplomatic immunity prevents us from stepping in. Good evening, Stephen. We're right here. We can't get close to him. We need somebody on the inside. Our sources tell us that he's trying to obtain certain information that would make him a threat of global proportions, a nuclear threat. Now, we have no intentionof letting that happen. That's where you come in. Well, then, I suppose this is the part where you offer me $1 million and complete immunity from prosecution. If I cooperate, right? No, we're gonna let you live. How you making out with our guest? Not much progress to report, ma'am. We need more time. She's a tough broad. Time is one thing we don't have, Graver. And that broad is our only link to Mahler. Everyone has a weakness, a flaw, something that can be exploited. You've gotta find that something, Graver. Whatever it takes, whateveryou have to do, just do it. I don't care if you have to beat her, drug her, or sleep with her. Just do it. Understood? Yes, ma'am. Oh, and Graver, get a shave. I can tell you one thing, partner. This sure doesn't look like anysewage plant I've ever seen. That's the understatementof the year, Murphy. It's goddamned fed central down there. So what do we do now? We go to the morgue. Excuse me? The morgue? What the hell for? I wanna find out what Lady Terminator wanted with that body. Shouldn't we just leavethat stuff up to the lab boys? Come on, partner. They're dead, they're naked,and some of 'em are female. Damn, couldn't we have done this before I ate? So what are you so squeamish about? They're dead. This place has a morgue on every floor. Even if we find the body, westill have to get the report. We've got to go see Sammy. Damn. Come on, Sammy. Give me a break. That's the just the onlylead I have on this case. All we wanna see is the autopsy report. Just five minutes, that's all we need. Sorry, guys. No can do. As I said before, the feds hadthis thing locked up tight. It's that son of a bitch Graver, isn't it? Look, Murphy, thisone's out of your league. You know I could get introuble just talking to you? Come on, Sammy, for old times sake. I swear on my mother, it'lljust take five minutes. That's all I need to writethe report, just five minutes. OK, Murphy. Give me an hour. You mean you haven't done the autopsy yet? What? You know, you guys have a lot of nerve! We'll be back in an hour. Yeah, fine! I can't believe this! We got dead bodies everywhere. I can't get an autopsy report. I mean, what's going on? Who are you? What the hell are you doing here? Get down. Out of my way. Get down, out of the hallway! Out of the hallway. Everyone move, move! Just hold it right there. What-- [screaming] We're police. Stay down, stay down! I want you all the get up, get in your rooms, and close the doors! [electric current crackles] [screaming] Good Good morning, Alexa. Did you sleep well? Are you hungry? I can have some food sent up. Well, I guess youhaven't changed your mind about our offer, have you? Go to hell. I guess not. Your daughter drew that picture. Very well. Tanya! Tanya, baby, it's mommy! She can't hear you. She can't see you. And that's the way it's gonnastay, unless you cooperate! It's up to you. If you don't help us, I guarantee you, you will spend the rest of your life in a maximum security prison. And you will never see your daughter again. You bastard. All your hard work is about to pay off. I knew you wouldn't let me down. It's a shame, though, about little Max. Ah well. Good thing I have five more brothers. Well, is there a problem? Sir, it just doesn't seem to be here. What the fuck are you talking about? It better be there! Got it. Isn'tr it ironic, how something so small, so insignificant can changethe course of history? With the information contained in this chip, the rest of the world wereto finally take me seriously. Think of it. A nuclear weapon 100 timesmore powerful than anything the Americans have! Every nation in the world will look to us as the one true superpower. Ah yes, dear old Gregory. When you volunteered for this job, I suppose you didn't realize youwould finish up in a body bag. Now, get this stinking thing out of here. Yes, sir. Something wrong with your food? You haven't touched your dinner. Cut the smalltalk, Graver. I told you everything I know. The chip is in the body. If you want it, all you have to do is go get it. Well, that might be kind of difficult. You see, your buddy Mahler beat us to it. They broke into the morgue yesterday. They got the body, killeda cop in the process. So what? So that means you're going in, tomorrow. Why me? Can't the United Statesgovernment just walk in there and blow Mahler's brains out? I mean, they do that all the time, don't they? It's not as easy as that. You see, Mahler is a guest in this country. He's a diplomat. Use of force against him could trigger a war. It's a delicate situation. So you think I can just walk back like nothing ever happened? He knows I've been arrested. He'll never trust me again!- Just do it. What about my daughter? Once we get the chip in our hands. Just out of curiosity, howdid you ever get hooked up with a guy like Mahler? Why do you wanna know? Well, I've studied your files,and I was just wondering what-- what made you tick. It's all I know how to do. You're supposed to be good. Let's see how good. How do you know I won't shoot you? I don't. Not bad. Would you like some water? Thanks. You've been stretching here for hours. I was just thinking about the past. The past can be a very scarything to think about sometimes. I try not to think about it. Well, there are some things you just can't stop thinking about. Yeah. Things like not beingable to tell your daughter what you do for a living. You know everything about me. I don't know a thing about you. I had a house. I had a wife. I had a life. My wife was killed in anaccident three years ago. But we're trained to forget about it. But it's always there. You gotta get ready. You're working soon. Graver, there's a chanceI might not make it back. Let me see my daughter before I go. Bud. You got a lot ofexplaining to do, Murphy. I don't know what in the hell you thought you were doing at that hospital. You got your own little privatewar going on, is that it, huh? You had no business at that hospital! And as far as I'm concerned, youare responsible for Benedetti's death. You better come up-- I don't give a shit what you think! Man, get the fuck out of my face! My, my. What have we here? Shouldn't Alexa be getting readyfor her little party tonight? I think you've gone too far this time. Get the girl out of here. Take her to our desert location, immediately. You know, Graver, I'm onlygonna say this to you once. There is no room in this operation for your personal feelings. So I suggest you get them under control. You pull another stunt like this, and your career is over, or worse. Understood? Yes, ma'am. [beep] What is it now? Halt. Hold it up. This is private property, sir. You're gonna have to go around. Graver around? Hey, hey! I want a sentry posted there full time. That's all. He's secured. The fire was contained. Everything's all right. What cell is he in? On your monitor, camera number 18. Call his captain. What's his name? O'Neil. Call Captain O'Neil, and tell him his man's gonna be here a while. [chuckling] I'll say one thing for him. He's one stubborn son of a bitch. Well, I'm glad you find this amusing, Graver, because, frankly, I don't. He could jeopardize the entire operation. Hey, Graver. I know you're up there watching! You better get me out of here! I'm a police officer! Oh, you're amused, huh? I got something for your amusement pleasure. I'll go down there right away. Don't bother. I'll handle this one personally. Graver, It's just about time for us to send your little girlfriend on her way. Do you think you can handlethat without screwing it up? I'll try. Good. You have everything you need in that bag. Here's the keys. Graver. Don't worry about your daughter. She'll be well taken care of. Good luck. Detective. Detective. Detective. Jesus. That's the second time this week I've got my ass kicked by a chick. You better behave yourself, detective. Or I'll have you put in amuzzle and a straight jacket. Now, what are you doing here? I'm sure by now you know thisis a government facility. What I know is that yougot that Rambo bitch here. And my partner's dead, and she's involved. I know she knows something about it. So I wanna see her, and I wanna see her now. Oh, you're not in any positionto make demands, detective. You may not realize this,but you're interfering in a very delicate operation. Now, we've spent a lot of timeand money setting this up, and no over-the-hill flatfoot's gonna come along and blow it for us. Oh yeah? So what are you gonna do, kill me? That can be arranged. She's gone around the roadside. I've got her. What the hell is going on? We're under attack. By who? Alexa. Get her, and bring her to me! Alive! Just Is this what you've been looking for? Hand it over. Mr. Mahler has been waiting for you. We've kept him waiting long enough. By the way, I'm very impressed. Now, drop the gun, or I'll put a hole in your pretty little head. One scratch on me and Victorwill feed you to the sharks. But if you insist, let's go on three. 1, 2-- So let me see if I got this straight. You're telling me thatMahler killed my partner, and Alexa used to work for Mahler, but now she works for you. So it's Mahler that I'm after, not the girl. Exactly. Hah. Man, I don't even know what I just said. Why are you telling me this? Because deep down, I thinkyou and I are a lot alike. Well, that's terrific. You know, you and I are now buddies. Why don't you see about getting me out of here? I've got a date with this Mahler. Well, that's already taken care of. You see, once we get the chip,we'll have enough to put him away for good. Yeah, but we do it myway, we save the taxpayers a hell of a lot of money. Sorry, I can't do it, detective. If there's anything else Ican get you, you let me know. I take it Mahler's head on a platter would be asking for too much? [laughter] I'll see what I can do. Terrific. Well, did you get it? You've got what you wanted. Where's my daughter? She did her part. I think we should honor the bargain. I'm afraid it's not that easy. What if this is a fake? It's gonna take time to get it authenticated. I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to wait. Give me back my daughter! Get her out of here! Get her the-- get her the hell out of here! Mr. Mahler. What? What is it? We traced the license plate number. And? The Porsche is registered toa Mr. Mark Graver, a supervisor for a sewage treatment plant. Sewage treatment? A sewage treatment plant? What will the feds come up with next? Go there, and watch for this Graver. I have a feeling he will lead us directly to my micro-chip and Alexa. Look, it's just gonna take a few days. Try to be patient. You're a liar. Why should I believe you? You're all the same. Damn feds! I wanna see my daughter, and I wanna see her now. Your daughter's not here. Where is she? They've moved her to another outpost. I'll have her brought to you. When? A couple hours. You have my word. Tanya. Mommy, mommy! Mommy, mommy, I missed you. How much time do I have? One hour. Thanks. I've been examining thisthing for the last few hours. Well, is it the real thing or not? You see here? That's a highly sophisticated version of a massively parallel microprocessor. In this case, I'd estimate it can crunch a trillion floating pointoperations per millisecond. That's the same kind of pattern recognition used in stealth bomber and SDI technology. Now, I heard rumors we weredeveloping something like this. I never dreamed it was possible. Yeah, yeah, very impressive,but is it the chip or not? The geodesic markings are unmistakable. Quite atypical. No other chip in theworld has this schematic. It's the real McCoy, all right. What's so special about this thing? Well, ma'am, its genetic engineering enables it to process and encode binary pulses generated by any interfacing source, rendering all existingweapons systems obsolete. Uh-huh. You wanna run that by me in English? Let me put it this way. If Mahler had successfullydecoded the chip, he could have held the entire world hostage. Theoretically, of course. I see. Mommy, when will I see you again? Soon, I promise. Be a good girl now. Mommy loves you so much. OK, mommy. I love you. [car starts] Mr. Mahler, look who's here. Tanya, welcome home. It's so good to see you. Maria! Where is Maria? Ah, Maria, take Tanya to herroom and fix up some ice cream. Chocolate, right? Did you miss me? Get Alexa on the telephone for me. Right away, sir. We have a problem. Put him through. It's Mahler. MAHLER [ON PHONE]: Alexa. Yes. Now that I have yourattention, you bloody traitor, let's get down to business, shall we? You have something I want, andnow I have something you want. Don't touch her. What you'll do is bring me my micro-chip! Tom Bradley LAX, tomorrow,12:00 noon, alone. Or we start playing target practice with your little bitch. Victor, please. You're such a greatdisappointment to me, Alexa. You were the ultimate weapon-- cold, brutal, perfect. And look at you now-- worthless. Remember, the clock is ticking. Oh, and don't worry aboutyour daughter, Alexa. She'll be well taken care of. Vlad likes little girls. He'll kill her. Out of the question! The agency will not be blackmailed. You're playing with a little girl's life! It's between the two of them now, Graver. The agency has nothing to do with it. If the agency is through withher, I should let Alexa go! We'll let her go when I say. She's still useful to us. I'm going for the girl. The only way you're gonna stopme is by pulling that trigger. I got work to do. Hey, look, graver. Now, this is all very impressive, but where are you taking me? I'm taking you up on your offer, man. Meaning? Meaning, I got an appointment with Mahler, and I need some backup. You interested? - You bet your ass. I got something to show you. My, my, my. Christmas comes early, huh? Eenie, meenie, minie, oh moe. It's good. ANNOUNCER: Delta flight 121 now boarding Gate C. American Airlines-- Well, it's nice you decided to come. Is Alexa here? ANNOUNCER: Peter Santana, please pick up the white courtesy phone. Peter Santana, please pickup the white courtesy phone. Delta flight 121 now boarding Gate C3. Delta flight 121 now boarding Gate C3. [phone ringing] MAHLER [ON PHONE]: Hello, Alexa. I'm here. Let's get it over with. Right to the point, as always. First, the chip. Set the case on the ground,and stay right where you are. I gotta tell you, I don't like this. What's going on? Now, hang up the phone,and walk toward the south. Now, why don't we just go down and bust him? Just take it easy. Huh? We lose that case, we're screwed, man. He's got a little back-up there. Well done, Alexa, as always. Why all the goons, Victor? I recognize at least 10 of them. Just a precautionary measure. One can never be too careful. So that's the big man, huh? Yeah. I held up my end of the bargain. Now where's my daughter? My jet is waiting outside. I've decided to relocate permanently. Nobody make a move till I say so. Just put it away. My country is veryscenic this time of year. You and Tanya will love it! Victor, don't do this. Let her go. We take off in fiveminutes, with or without you. It's up to you Oh, and this time, you must leave your friends behind. Victor, wait! How do I know Tanya's all right? Oh, Alexa, you disappoint me. You really think I could hurt her? All right. As you wish. Vlad, come in, Vlad. Go for Vlad. Put the girl on. Her mother wants to speak with her. Tanya? Now, look, all I want you tosay is hello to your mother. You got that? ALEXA [ON PHONE]: Tanya, are you there? Hey, what are you doing here? Don't worry about it. I'm security. Oh yeah? Well, let's see some ID. Sure. Hey, come back here! Tanya? She's not here! Vlad, what the hell is going on? Um, she got away momentarily. You idiot! Catch her! What the hell is happening? You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. He's getting away! Hey, hey, what are you doing? CIA. Open the door. Yeah, right. And I'm the pope. This is for private jets only. Well, why don't we try this one, buddy? Now, open the damn door! Come on, come on, come on! You got it, you got it. Come on! Wait, wait, wait! I've flown with this guy. He always takes a shortcut. Follow me. Well, it looks like we'regoing in the right direction. Tanya! Hey! All right, look. You check out that area. I'll go down this way. No way, man! We stick together. We do it one room at a time. There's not enough time for that. Look, if he gets a hold of Tanya, it's all over. - Anything? - Nothing. Well, find her. I'm looking for runway number five. I seem to be lost. This is a secured area. You don't belong here. Oh, excuse me. What? We gotta get security down here right away! Control, come in, Control . We just heard gunshots down here. Send security immediately. Where's the girl? [scream] TANYA: Help! Tanya! TANYA: Let go of me! Let go of me! Put the gun down or Iput a bullet in her head! Let her go, you son of a bitch! Put it down! Let her go. [scream] Hey. Hey, look. You gotta hang in there, OK? You gotta hang in there. You'll be all right. Graver, you're a piss-poor liar. [coughing] Well, well, what a touching reunion. Put the gun down, now! Stand up, move away. Move away, quickly! Victor, let her go. It's me you want. Then, come. Come with me, Alexa. I love you so much. We can have a good life, you, Tanya, me. It's not too late. Come. Go. Mommy. Quickly, we must go now. The plane is waiting. Come! Please, come! No! Get out of the way, Alexa. Move! Get out of the way! Move! [electric crackling] I believe that belongs to me. Thank you. You know, Graver, I don'tapprove of your methods, but you certainly know how to get the job done. But as far as I'm concerned,that's all that counts. I figured I was out of a job. What gave you that idea? You know, you two make a great team. I got big plans for you. It's over. [music playing]
