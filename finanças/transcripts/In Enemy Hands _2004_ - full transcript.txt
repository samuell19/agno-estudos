[Man narrating] At the outbreak of world war ii Germany increased its u-boat production by 1,000%, mass-producing 17 new u-boats a month. Hitler knew the key to winning the war in Europe was to control the Atlantic, and control it they would. By the end of 1942, German u-boats working in groups known as "wolf packs" sunk over 1,000 allied ships. Their success gave Germany a decisive advantage. They were winning the war, and if this trend continued, all of Europe would fall. In January 1943, president Roosevelt and prime minister Churchill declare that stopping the u-boats be their top priority. With the U.S. fully committed to the war, and new advances in technology, the allies strike back. After losing an average of only five u-boats a month, Germany suffers its greatest losses in what would be known as "black may." [Machine gunfire] That month allies sink and destroy 41 u-boats. Eight out of every ten u-boat sailors died. The reign of the "wolf pack" was rapidly drawing to a close. I've known you your whole life. I'm not gonna embarrass you with the details. Your father was a good man, a great soldier. Thank you, sir. It's out of respect for him that I'd just as soon you didn't do this. We're not here to chase ghosts. Our job is to pursue an enemy and defeat it. You certain that's what you want to do? Absolutely. When do you ship out? Two weeks, Monday after next. We'll be ready. Met your cob yet? No, sir. Nate Travers. Not yet. Nathan Travers. He's a good man. You might actually learn something from him, if you're interested in that sort of thing. Give 'em hell, commander. Oh, I plan to, sir. That's an order. Yes, sir. [Birds chirping] I'm just waiting for some things hanging on the line to dry. And your mom wants you to call her before you go. [Sniffles] Don't go without calling her, because I'm the one who's gonna have to deal with it every day until you get back. And I love her, but she's your mother. You deal with her. I'm gonna take this. I'm taking this with me. I'll stick it right above my bunk. It'll be the last thing i see when I go to bed, [Sniffles] And the first thing I see when I awake. Oh, damn it. Why'd you go and do that? What? you know what. Now you got me started and i can't stop once I get started. [Sniffles] Sorry. and you're not sorry. I love you. Promise me something, Nate Travers. Anything. Promise me you won't get yourself killed trying to be a hero. You think you can get rid of me that easily? No. I'm serious. Honey, don't start that. Promise me you'll come home. I promise. Swear it. I swear. I'll come home to you. [Quietly] okay. [Sighs] [Sonar pinging] [Pinging continues, louder] [Shouting in German] [Splashing fades] [Ratcheting, clattering] [Banging] [Metallic squeak] [Hissing] [Cheering] [Alarm blaring] [Alarm continues] All ahead two thirds. [Man] All ahead two thirds! Make ready to dive. Make ready to dive! Settle down. We're switching to battery power. Come on. Move it. Let's go! Knock it off. Come on. Get your hands off your pecker. Giddyap! yeah, yeah, yeah! Green board. Pressure in the boat. Take her to 6-0. Take her to 6-0. Five degree down angle. Sixty feet. Five degree down angle. Aye. [Crash] [feedback squeal] [Machinery whirring] [Switch bangs, whirring stops] [Helmsman] Sixty feet, sir. Zero bubble? Zero bubble, sir. Zero bubble at 6-0, sir. Scope up. Scope up! Time. sixty-four seconds. Sixty-four seconds. Sixty-four seconds. Prepare to surface. Exercise complete. Prepare to surface. Exercise complete. Chief, in my quarters. Periscope going down! [Coughing] Not again. Maybe I should just go for a swim. Can I join you? [Commander] now, chief. Right there, sir! [Coughing] you look like crap. You should see the medic. There's a lot of things i should do. Three months. Three months in the water and the men have become complacent and sloppy. If you were in my shoes, would that trouble you? Yes, sir. Today's dive time was 64 seconds. Three days ago it was 58 seconds. Six seconds, chief. We're in the Atlantic now. We can't afford to give the Germans a six-second advantage. I'll speak to the men. See that you do. Chief, you may have more experience, but I've been preparing for this for a long time, and I do know what I'm doing. I don't doubt that, sir. Something's on your mind, chief. Let's have it. I was thinking about the men's morale. They're frustrated by these constant exercises, and it's clearly not helping their performance. So what is it? You and the men disappointed we haven't seen any action? No. it-- it's not that. Then what is it? Chief, what is it? I was thinking, to keep spirits up, maybe we could give the men a little more latitude-- a little less exercise? [Chuckles] mmm. well, that's not your decision. And I've made mine. The crew's performance is not what it needs to be. And the drills will continue per my orders. Understood? Aye, sir. Is that all? Yeah. that's all. You're dismissed. [Inhales] [Telegraph beeping, static] [Keyboard taps] [Beeping continues] [Beeping stops] [Paper rustling] [Sighs] [Footsteps departing] [Curtain drawn] ** [swing band fast] All right. Don't be stingy. Thanks. how many dress rehearsals does that make-- 27, 28, maybe? I don't know and don't care. It figures as much from you. I mean, not like we'd ever done it before. I don't get why he doesn't find krauts to pester instead of jerking our chains every five minutes. What's he trying to prove? Least he could do is whenever it's not real he could tell us. We don't shit our pants every time. That would explain the complaints I've been getting from laundry services. [Quietly] chief. The reason we've conducted 27 exercises, Mr. Miller, is for you to become so accustomed to your task, so masterful in your skills, that you do not shit yourself when this boat comes under attack! I understand, chief. Wanna talk some trash? Save it for those Nazi sons of bitches crawling up and down our east coast looking to blow us out of the water. Anyone seen the x.O.? Oh, yeah. I think I saw him going into the head, chief. [Retches, splashing] [Spits] [Grunting] [Breathing heavily] [Knocking on door] You all right in there, sir? Fine, chief. Be up in a minute. Torpedoes, how do you lose an entire convoy? Increase speed to 18 knots. [Ratcheting] [bell clanging] The achilles lost radio contact here. Since we're the closest allied vessel, we've been ordered to take a look. There's been no reported u-boat activity in that area for several weeks, but that does not mean that they're not there. Chief, no drill this time. I'll inform the men. Confirm coordinates. Let sinclan know we're on our way. Aye, captain. [Sniffles] [Footsteps approach] [Sniffles] Who's in there? I've been waiting for too long. Hey. open up. Aw, shit. Who is it? The x.O. Let's get him to the medic. Come on. [Coughing] [instruments rattling] Flu? not sure. Could be a reaction to something he ate. How long you been feeling like this? A week, maybe. Since Panama. [Miller] Hey, chief? The captain needs you. I think it's important. [Coughs] I need to come too. [Chief] You're not going anywhere. You wish you could order me around. [Medic] I can. Keep the liquids coming. Let me know of any changes. [Continues coughing] Yes, sir. Nurse Cooper at your service. We need to keep him here-- away from the rest of the crew-- until I have a chance to check on the others to see if they have any of the same symptoms. It's that serious? Could be meningococcus. English? it's a form of meningitis. It's highly contagious, and in some cases it can be fatal. [Clicking] anything? [Clicking continues] No, sir. Chief, glad you could join us. Put the men on full alert. Yes, sir. Where's the x.O.? In his stateroom, sir. He's taken ill. Have Mr. Goodman standing by. Sir, the x.O. Can barely stand. He's got a rash, and the medic-- chief, we're in hostile waters. If the x.O. Is breathing, i want him at his post. [Sighs] aye, sir. [Clicking continues] ** [swing band, slow] ** [continues] [Dial twists] ** [swing continues,louder] [Man] that's music by Glenn Miller from the spacious cafe Rouge at the hotel Pennsylvania in New York City, where the young at heart come from far and near to watch and hear the orchestra that has given America some of the most beautiful sounds ever heard. [Clicking] [shortwave static] ** [swing resumes, distant] Captain. captain! I've got something at 3-4-0, 4,000 feet. Sounds like music. You dirty dog. Mr. Goodman, set torpedo depth to 10 feet. [Stopwatch clicks] Set torpedo depth 10 feet. Depth set? Depth is set! Ready tubes one and two. Ready bow tubes one and two. Come on. Gyro angle? 3-4-9. Gyro angle: 3-4-9. Set? set. Fire one. Fire one. Fire one. [Hissing] Fire two. Fire two. Fire two. [Coughing] Torpedoes! [cursing in German] [Loud explosions] Oh! They're hit, sir, but still up. Goddamn it! Prepare to attack again. Prepare to attack again. Torpedoes, depth, 12 feet. Torpedo depth, 12 feet. Depth is set! Depth is set! Ready bow tubes three and four. Ready bow tubes three and four. Angle? angle!

Well done. [Others applauding, cheering] Good work, boys. Good work. We got 'em! [Laughing] mm. how does it feel to have your cherry popped? Oh, Christ, it's better than the first time, man. The first time? [Applauding, cheering continues] Yes! That's what it's all about. All right? He's dead. [Man] screw in the water! Right full rudder. All ahead flank. Now! Move! Right full rudder. All ahead flank! [Men yelling, grunting] [Yelling] I need damage reports, chief. Damage reports! Mr. Wright, i need damage reports. It's no use. He's gone. [Loud clatter] [Commander] Miller! yes, sir! Blow valve buoyancy. Surface! Surface! Surface! [Yelps, groans] [Yelling] Help me! [Both straining] Who's in there? Nobody. There all dead in there, chief. Come on! Listing 10 degrees port! Forward torpedoes, forward bow. We're taking on water, sir! We've lost the engines, captain! We're not gonna make it, captain. She's goin' down! Captain, you gotta-- don't tell me what i have to do, chief! I know what I have to do. [Switch clicks] This is your captain speaking. Abandon ship. I repeat, abandon ship. Abandon ship. [Shouting, indistinct] Captain, there's nothing more you can do. She's goin' down. Come on! Tend to the others, chief. That's an order! [Man] come on, chief. We gotta hurry. [Grunting, yells] [Moans, sputtering] Come on! Captain, we gotta get out of here! No. Not till the crew's out! No. listen to me. They're all dead. This is a casket. We gotta get out of here. [Moans] Come on! [Both grunting] * you made me love you * I didn't wanna do it * I didn't wanna do it * you made me love you * and all the time you knew it * * I guess you always knew it * you made me happy * sometimes this has been the best Thanksgiving ever. I do good holidays. Mm. You just wait till Christmas. [Chuckles] Kiss me. [Water dripping] [Man shouting in German] [Footsteps departing] [Exhales] [Wright] come on. Let's go. Let's go. It's okay, captain. You got it. You got it. [German] Everybody all right? [Others] yeah. yeah. Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I don't want to go to Germany. Shh. You know what they do to prisoners in Germany? They torture 'em, and then they gas 'em or they burn 'em alive! Shut up. Shut up. Those officers in Panama said they did it to all those Jews. They just cook them! Just cook 'em like meat! Shut up! Calm down, Miller. That's an order, sailor. [Exhales] we're gonna hold it together. We panic now, we're as good as dead. [Cooper] they're supposed to just let us drown, captain. Why didn't they just let us fucking drown? [Coughs, retches] [Continues retching] [Coughs] [Captain spits, sniffles] [Exhales] chief, we're gonna break up into three groups. I'll head up a team to search for food and supplies. I want you to radio sinclan position. Find out what our orders are. Tell 'em we contacted the enemy. Understand? Understand? But, captain-- [breathing heavily] Easy. Easy. [Grunts] Help me. [Captain] I'm all right. I got him. [Breathes heavily] You should've let me die on my boat, chief. You should've let me die on my boat. [Muttering] [Breathing heavily] Is he dead? What are we gonna do, chief? What are you looking at me for? The captain's-- the captain ain't the captain no more. He's gone off his mind, chief. He ain't gonna be able to help us now. I counted at least 20 of them pricks. That means there's probably twice that many. Yeah, and they got guns too. Piss off, you damned kraut. [German] [quietly] Hey, come on. What the hell is this? My guess is... Pig balls and chicken guts, if we're lucky. Gimme one for the captain. Okay, chief. How do we know they didn't poison it, chief? How do we know they didn't do that? 'Cause if they wanted us dead, they would have let us drown. Besides, we're gonna need all the strength we can get, so... Eat up. [Captain coughing, chokes] You should try to eat something. You said that Goodman had a rash. What did the medic think it was? Meningitis. What'd it look like? [Sighs] [Clears throat] I want you to keep this between us, chief. I don't want to startle the men. Understand? [Coughing quietly] [Man coughs] Hey! hey, someone's coming. [Door opens] [Coughs wheezily] [Shuddering quietly] [Clattering, distant] Who is of highest rank? [Americans protesting] Okay. it's okay. Okay, okay, okay. What's your position? Chief of boat. What happened to your captain, chief of boat? He didn't make it. Went down with the ship? Yeah, he did. These are your men. They do as you tell them, and we do not have a problem. [Captain coughing] What's the matter with him? [Coughing continues] He was injured trying to get out. He'll be needing medical assistance. We split in half-- smaller groups, more comfortable... For all of us. [German] [Cuffs ratcheting] [German] [Coughing] Hey. hey. [Bumps head] Watch your fucking head. Man, how can anybody sleep like that? Got clobbered in the head. Probably has a concussion. Well, should we wake him first? Shit, I wouldn't. Oh, man, look at that. Hey, Wright, don't touch that. Wright, don't fuckin' touch it! Why? why not? Shit. guys, that's not a wound. That's a rash. What? my sister got it when she was a kid-- meningitis, I think-- i don't know exactly. She got it from the water in our well. How long does it last? About a week. How do you treat it? I got a bunch of stuff-- you don't, Wright. So, what, it just goes away? No. You said it lasted a week. Yeah. I said, "about a week." And then we buried her. Christ, abers! Abers, is it contagious? Well, I didn't get it, but yeah. [Sighs] aw, great! Great. If the krauts don't kill us, the captain will. [Door opening] What are you doing? [Unsheathes blade] What's he saying? Aw, come on. What the hell are you doing? [German] You all right? Mm. [Door closes] [Sighs] [Retches] [splashing] [Coughing] [Moaning] [Sighs] [Coughing] [Others coughing, distant] [Others coughing continues] [Officers speaking German] [Hydraulics whirring] [Curses in German] [Banging] Chief, they're preparing to attack. We gotta do something. [Ratcheting] [Rattling] [Rattling] [Coughs] Now! [all straining] [Shouts, indistinct] [Growling] [Straining] [ grunts] [Yelling over P.A.] Stop the launch! I'm on it! [Footsteps running] [Chain rattling] We got company! Ox, a little help! [Straining] How are you gonna know which one is which? More than five torpedoes. Don't matter if it's a German, jap or Portuguese for that matter. Do it fast! [All yelling] No, no, no. [Moans] Got it! I got it! Cooper! no! [Explosion] stop! stop it right now! [Chief] don't shoot. Don't shoot. Right full rudder. Take evasive action. Get me a location on that thing. [Alarms blaring] [Alarms continue] [Sonar pinging] [Pinging continues] [Captain] What was that? [Coughs] [Hull creaking softly] [Cocks pistol] You've killed us all. If you pull that trigger now, you might just as well paint a bull's-eye on the side of this boat. Captain, is it over? It hasn't even started. [Alarms blaring] [Hull creaking] No, no, no! [All shouting] [Shouting continues] [Wright] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! captain! [Gunshot] [Cooper] captain! captain! Captain's dead. Look at him! What is it? I'm not sure. Our medic thought it might be meningitis. Contagious? Very. Is there a cure? I'm-- I'm not a doctor. [Sighs] [Explosion, distant] [Coughs] [Explosion, distant] [Men coughing] [Explosion, clattering] [Men coughing] [Cooper] abers. [Abers] I'm here. When you get out, don't you tell my mother that I died this way. [Sniffling] Tell her that I went... quick with no-- no pain. [Apparatus hits floor] No pain. [Moans] [Gurgles, gasps] [Breathing heavily] [Dog tags hit floor] [Dog tags rattling] [Hull creaking quietly] [Woman] don't quit. Don't quit on me, Nate. Rachel. I've never seen you like this before. My men are dying. I'm near the end. I can't accept that. I'm sorry. Never be sorry. What am I supposed to do, hon? You're supposed to come home to me. How? I don't have any fight left. I don't-- I'm not going to be one of those wives, Nate Travers. I'm not back there waiting for some telegram to tell me that my husband is dead. I won't let you do that to me. You made me a promise. Oh, god, I miss you. Then come back to me. [Shortwave static] [Dial twists] [Hatch opens] [Breeze blowing] [Ocean flowing] [All breathing deeply] That's fresh air. The hatch is open. That means we lost our Navy. [German] Yeah. that's my family. That's Vivian and-- and little Danny junior. Looks like me, huh? [Ox] Give it a rest, will ya? They don't care. He doesn't care about your family. Is this your son? Ja. [German] Peter... junior. [German] [Telegraph beeping] [Beeping resumes] [Handcuffs rattling] Your men, they follow your orders, do they not? They do. Would they follow mine? I've lost two thirds of my men. Your Navy is not far away and our distress calls have failed. I have no option left. Between all of us, we have just enough hands to make this boat operational. If you and your men join my men, we might have a chance. You want us to help you? I want you to help yourselves. And if we refuse? We all die. [Chief] what exactly are you proposing? Our diesel is nearly exhausted and the fuel line has been damaged. But if we are efficient, we should be able to make 500, maybe 600 kilometers. You can't really expect my men to help you deliver 'em into custody. We travel submerged by day, making up time on top at night. If my calculations are correct, we should be able to make landfall in three days. Jonas! You're serious? Once we are close to shore, we deploy the life rafts, we evacuate the men, and we scuttle the boat. You understand I will not allow my boat to fall into your country's hands. In return for this, I surrender myself to you and ask for consideration for my men. Ludwig! [curtain drawn] [Footsteps departing] [Sighs] i need your answer. I can't make any guarantees once you're in U.S. custody. I understand. All I ask for is that you report to your superiors what I've done. So when this war is over, they save my men like I saved yours. I'll need to speak to my men first-- all of them. You have ten minutes. You want us to team up with the jerries? [Cooper] I don't like it, chief. No sirree. I'm with them on this one. I don't trust these kraut bastards as far as I could throw 'em. [Wright] why don't we just wait 'em out? They're dropping like flies. We'll wait until enough of 'em are infected, and then we take the boat. Sh. Why not? How long are you gonna wait? Romano's already dead. How long before you're infected? We don't have time. None of us are in the clear on this thing. [Cooper] we've been taught since day one to hate these guys. Now you want us to work with 'em? Shit! I don't like it either, but this is our best shot. I made a promise to my wife-- that I'd get home without getting myself killed. It's a promise i want to keep. [Door opens] It's time. [Breathing heavily] [Footsteps approaching] Okay. listen up. Miller. Yes. You stick with officer cremer. He'll help you to get a handle on things. Okay, chief. And remember, we're metric now. Ox? I want you to, um-- um-- it's "hans," right? Your, uh, namen-- "hans"? Mm-hmm. good. I want you to follow hans to the engine room. We'll run on one engine only. I want to conserve as much diesel as we can. Make it happen. All right. What else? A planesman. Um, abers. Hm? think you can fly this boat? Yeah. all right. Virgil? [Shouting] Let's continue. [Ordering in german] [All straining] [Coughs] [Praying quietly in German] [Cooper] come on, Jerry. Let's get this over with! Cooper! hang on, all right? Can't you see the man's praying? Comin' up. [Grunts] [Orders in German] "Ahead one half." [Repeats order in German] [Ratchets] [machinery begins pounding] [Orders in German] [German] "Bearing 2-8-5." Bearing 2-8-5. [Orders in german] [Repeats in German] [Lever ratcheting] [Engines humming] "All ahead full." Hey, come on. Pliers. pliers. [Sighs] [Breathes deeply] [Chief] nah. used to smoke-- two packs a day. Down here-- [Lighter flicks, snaps shut] Two packs need to last you two months. Nah. nah, i-- okay. [Chuckles] Your men... are good. You trained them well. Well, it wasn't just me, but thank you. Maybe this crazy plan can work. Maybe. [Footsteps approaching] Captain. Yes? Sun's coming up soon. I suggest we prepare to dive. Of course. I've lost them. Captain has lost the respect of his men. Well, they'll respect you later, when you've saved their lives. If the situation were reversed, would you do the same? I'm-- I'm not a captain. I couldn't make that call. Just pretend. In the grand scheme of things, what's one boat? This war is gonna end. Doesn't mean we have to end with it. There's one thing we haven't discussed. What do we do if we come across a German boat? You mean, do i throw away our plan? You go back to being prisoners, maybe killed? And we go back to Germany? It crossed my mind. What if we come across an American warship? What stops you from having me and my men killed? These items belong to your men. Thank you. You're married? Yeah. To the only woman who would have me. You? yes. Kids? Three. I have three girls. Even more reason to get through this thing alive. Do you know why I picked up you and your men? It's protocol for a sub commander, after sinking an enemy vessel, to arrest only the captain and chief. Hitler himself made that a standing order. If that's the case, then... why the others? We hold positions of power, Mr. Travers. Men look to us for leadership. But saving you and your men was the first time in all my years of service I actually felt powerful. To save a life instead of taking it away-- that's power. I'm tired of this war. This can longer be about sides. We are now on the same side. So... what happens if and when... We come across an American or a German boat? We do what we have to to make sure that our men come home alive. [Whispering in german] What's going on in here? Where's hans? What is it with you guys? Lovers' spat? [Grunting] Help! [Shortwave static] [Beeping] [Beeping continues] What the hell are you doing? [Blows landing] Got him? Since first met, never liked. All of you! What's going on, chief? [Ratcheting] [Torpedo hissing] [Captain shouts in German] [Hissing continues] [Hissing increases] [Bangs switch] [Bullet ricochets] [Yelling] [Choking] [Choking continues] [Body hits floor] Jonas! He sold us out, chief. The bastard sold us out. We're so damn close, chief. Do we know what was sent? At best, our position. At worst, our situation. Well, then, we don't have much time. All right. You're in charge. What do we do? Periscope depth. We're going up. Periscope depth. Let's take it up. Let's move, guys. [Chief] what's our depth? Straight and level at 12 meters. Periscope up. Periscope up! Hey, I got something. Bearing 1-8-0, 2,300 meters. [Clicking switches] Have a look. [Chief] it's an American destroyer. 2,400 meters, chief. She's moving away. Wherever she's going, she's in one hell of a hurry. [Miller] 2,600 meters. You think she saw us? No, but-- what? she may be the one. The one what? You think you can reach her? Yeah, if she's got her ears on. What do you want to do? We show our hand. I don't understand "show our hand." We make radio contact. We surface. [German] What's he saying? What's he saying? If we surface, they blow us out of the water. They can blow us out of the water, anyway. It's an American boat. It's your call. Blow all ballasts. Prepare to surface. [Repeating orders in German] Whoa! chief, I think she's turning around. Virgil. I'm working on it. 2,400 meters, chief. [Chatter in english] I got it! [Miller] 2,300 meters. [Wright] go. you're on. This is chief of boat Nathan Travers of the USS swordfish. I repeat: This is chief of boat Nathan Travers of the USS swordfish. I am on board the u 429 with my surviving crew. We are in control of this boat. Sir. sir, you should hear this. Hold all fire. We will surface in good faith. What's going on? [Loud static] What is that? We're being jammed, chief. No. that's got to be a mistake. No, sir. He said his name was chief of boat Nathan Travers. We've got company. Boat in the water, 800 meters and closing. Whose is it? I can't tell. [Static] It's a German boat. Type 7c. I fear he sent more than a simple distress signal. Another u-boat, sir. Shit! That's it. Get me sinclan now! Yes, sir. [Chief] we should stay the course. And head straight for the u-boat? Well, if we go that way, we run right into that destroyer. I'll take my chances with the sub. Why? 'Cause I got you. [German] She's firing. On whom? Eel in the water! Kill the diesel! Go to battery and dive! Battle stations. [Alarms blaring] [Alarms continue] Depth? fifty meters. Take her to 70. No! That's exactly what he expects. Trust me. We've played this game many times. Take her up. You heard the man. Take her up. [Screaming] Chief, we can't take much more of this. We have to fight back. No. we can do this. I need damage reports. [German] Incoming. incoming! [Orders in German] [Abers] shit. what? "Right rudder." Damn. all hell's breaking loose out there. I'd like to know what is going on. Is that too much to ask? [Static] [Cremer] give it to me. [Clicking switches] No. There. [Plug hits table] I can't fire on my own! They don't seem to have a problem firing on you. I can't make... this decision. You have to. You're the captain now. [Whispering] We have one shot to do this. How's that? We have only one torpedo left. Chief, u-boat, 220 meters. She's turning around. She's right in front of us! She's getting into firing position. [Miller] destroyer: 1,800 meters. Let me worry about the destroyer. Just stay on that sub. Our lone torpedo's in the stern. On my Mark, all ahead full. Load rear torpedo tube-- six. six. Ready when you are, chief. Ready? hold on, everybody. Now. now! We're right on top of her. [Loud scraping] [Yelps] [German] "Up!" go! Thirty-five meters! We need more speed. Come on, you piece of junk. Fifty meters! Seventy-five meters! Hold on, Coop. We only got one shot. Let's make it a good one. I will not disappoint. Ninety meters! Wait. Hold on. [Torpedo hissing] 120 meters! Fire! fire! [Clangs] [Miller] it's a dud, chief. Hit, but didn't detonate. [German] [Alarms blaring] Fire! [Shells whistling] Incoming! [chief] Crash dive! [All yelling] [Clicking switches] You all right? Yeah. I can't hear. [Sonar pinging] [Pinging continues] Hey, chief, we're open! We're open! Put 'em on the speaker. Here you go. You're on. This is chief of boat Nathan Travers of the USS swordfish. Hold your fire. I repeat: Hold your goddamn fire! [Pinging continues] [Pinging stops] Chief Travers, this is the USS Logan. We read you loud and clear. Chief Travers, glad to hear you and your men are alive. This is captain Samuel Littleton. You are to secure the enigma decoding device and any and all documents. I'm sending an armed boarding party over. Do you copy? We're taking on water fast, sir. There's a-- there's a crack in the hull. We're going down fast. Abandoning ship. Chief. chief, listen to me. You are to secure those items. That's an order. Chief, we're not sinking. Yeah, we are. Yeah. There's a big damn crack, runs the length of this hull. Don't you see it? Guys, don't you see the crack going through the hull? Abers? Yes, chief, big crack. That's right, a big one. So let's open all the vents and scuttle this boat. Open 'em now! A promise is a promise. [Hissing] USS Logan, did not copy last transmission. You're breaking up. Did not copy last transmission. Chief! damn it! All clear, chief. Up you go. Whoo-hoo! we're going home! After you. I am still the highest-ranking officer on this boat. After you. [Chief] but sir, you don't-- no, Nate, I do. I understand entirely what you're saying. But, sir-- i just hope you can appreciate that, as prisoners of war, it makes the situation somewhat delicate. Sir, had it not been for their actions, six American lives, including my own, would have been lost. But they're Germans, and we're still at war here. [Footsteps approaching] I'm sorry, Nate. My hands are tied. It isn't possible. I hope you understand that. Nate. I realize what these men did for you, and I'm going to do everything in my power to see they're well taken care of. Thank you, sir. I was dead... several times. I-- I gave up all hope of ever coming home. I wish I could have been there for you. You were... In more ways than one. I don't know what I'd do without you. What, you think you can get rid of me that easily? [Engine starts] [Man on p.A.] On-duty quartermaster report to the h.Q. [Engine stops] [German] Thank you. Hello. This is my wife Rachel. She wanted to meet you. It's my pleasure. None of us would have made it, had it not been for your husband. You have a brave man there. He says the same about you. A telegram was sent to my house. It said that my husband's boat was missing, they have lost contact, and the crew was presumed dead. Thank you. [Chuckles] I'll let you two talk. I'll be right there. She's beautiful. I can't take credit for that, but thanks. Here. My cigarettes. How did you get these? You don't want to know. Thank you. How are the men? [Sighs] the food is good, clean rooms. The captain was unrealistic in his demands. I suspect he even knew this would be our fate. He didn't want you to end up here. He wanted us to live. He succeeded. We succeeded. The war will be over soon. Yeah. And we will return... home. If that torpedo had detonated, I don't know. I know. It's good to see you, my friend. [Lighter flicks] Closed-captioned by j.R.
