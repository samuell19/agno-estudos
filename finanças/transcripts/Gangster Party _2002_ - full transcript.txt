But others, he was so hurt by their betrayal, he wanted them to see his face when the death order was carried out. - Thus placing him at the scene of the crime. - [Agent 19] In his latest (mumbling) on the Upper West Side, we found him in an apartment building. - Stuck ice picks in each one of the man's ears until he touched his brains. There was a 24 year old female who fell asleep in her car after a long night of partying. She woke up to see the whole thing. She didn't recognize anyone else but she did recognize Mr. Delgato from the news and other criminal activities. - I see you've been watching CNN. - [Agent 55] Is the girl our only witness? - Well, yeah. - But-- - We believe Delgato was going to hire three outside assassins to deal with the treason in his organization. - Which three? - [Agent 19] Three ex-gang members turned hitmen. - [Agent Number One] First there's Bobby Argoza, most notorious of the East Los Angeles street gangs, nicknamed Cutty, he got his name from the extensive use of knives in his hits. Much better to cut you up than shoot you. (dramatic music) - [Agent 19] Eddie Lamar Evans, Compton Crip AKA Six Times Eddie. He acquired his name from his very first hit. He was shot six times and still completed his hit. - [Agent Number One] Francis Theodore Bradford, Westside Pirate Street Bloods, AKA the Bull. He got his name due to his size, strength, and the fact that he never stops going. - [Agent 19] Agent, are you with us? - I don't know. - [Agent Number One] When will you know? - (speaking quickly), I'm ready. - Any one of these three under normal circumstances would be hired to make this hit alone. - Because of the importance of this hit, we believe Delgato will hire all three. As Agent 19 said, any one of these men alone ensured that. Gathered they are a precise, effective killing machine. - [Agent 19] Before you accept or decline this mission, Federal law obligates us to give you an estimated chance of survival. There's a 95% chance you won't survive this mission. - [Agent Number One] Will you take this mission? - Yes. (dramatic music) - In the world of organized crime, they have a code name for when these three ex-gang members do a hit together. It's called gangster party. (dramatic music) (grunting) - This is shit. (grunting) (wind howling) Good morning, sleepy head. I didn't think you were ever gonna wake up. Shit, we've been driving all night. - Where am I?

That was for your ass. - Al wants me dead? Well why? - Man, you don't have to play stupid with me. - Man, what the hell are you talking about, man? - You're fucking his wife, that's what I'm talking about. Oh yeah, he knew about that. Man, you ever watch mafia movies? There's two rules, one, when you go into a restaurant and a guy asks to be excused to go to the restroom, your motherfucking ass better be gone when that motherfucker comes out. And second, don't fuck the mafia boss's wife. - Listen, I got an envelope, a manila envelope. It's got $100,000 in it, okay? I'll take it to her, you can have it, just say you killed me and I'll disappear, I'll just disappear. - [Six] Can't do it. - Oh please, please, man! I wanna live, I don't wanna die! - [Six] I can't do it. - Oh man, what are you talking about man, it's $100,000! - I already fucking got it! - Oh shit. Fuck, help, help! Somebody help me! Help me!

(engine starting) (dramatic guitar music) (wind howling) - Oh shit it's hot. - Please man, please don't do this. Please don't kill me for following my heart. - [Six] That's some weird shit. - What? - That's the same thing your wife said. - You killed Allison? - Man, quit acting like you cared about her and you did it for love. - I did do it for love, I did love her. - You did it for pussy. - Why, I did it for love! - Pussy. - Love! - Pussy. - What kind of an animal are you, man? - Animal, no, realist yes. Don't feel bad, it was some good pussy. - No man, I did it for. Hey man, how would you know? - [Six] I fucked her. - Oh Lord, is there no end to this torture? - Man, people are killing and dying over this pussy. I mean, I wanted to sample it, can you blame me? Just as I suspected, it was some good pussy. That's why you didn't hear me come in the room. You in there just getting yours. I cracked your ass over the head with a lamp, now you're laid out on the floor. I'm looking at her big, beautiful ass lying there, ooh. Ooh-ee. - So you raped her. - Hey, I ain't no punk ass faggot ass rapist. She offered it to me, she says please, don't hurt me, I'll give you anything you want. I told her I want that. And like a country mother at dinnertime, she said come and get it! And this is where you kinda made me mad. I'm in there, I'm tearing it up, ooh. Your ass starts to wake up. So I crash your ass again with another lamp. Make sure your ass is really out. And I went back to tearing that ass up. Ooh, ooh, turn over, ooh. She had a big ass, kinda like her sister. - And then you killed her. - Nah, I didn't kill her. - You said you killed her. - Hey I didn't say I killed her, you said I killed her. - So she's alive? - How do you think I got the $100,000? I'll just say I killed her and disappeared. (energetic rock music) (doorbell ringing) - Who the fuck is that? Go answer the fucking door. Damn, who the, are you guys expecting someone? - I didn't hear shit. - Hola, clean pool? - Georgie. - [Georgie] Who is it? - It's a Mexican. - What the fuck do you want? - [Cutty] Clean pool. - You're a day early, and where's the normal guy? - Sorry, no speak English. - Hector motherfucker, where's Hector? - Hector? Mexico. - Hector's in Mexico. I guess it don't matter who really cleans the pool. So what's your name? Your name-o? What's your fucking name-o? - Sorry, no speak English. - You don't speak English. So I guess I'm gonna have to name you myself. Your name is Little Bitch. So come on in Little Bitch.

Well you tell him if I chopped off his wife's head, would he know I was mad then? Fucking dumbass suckers. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Good. - You know, I ain't doing nothing. - Nothing, actually it's anything. I'm not doing anything. - Oh, you're not doing nothing either?

(game beeping) There's your game. - [Game] The golden squirrel. - Now if you pick it up, I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking eye. What are you gonna do now?

Maybe he should come up missing. - Brock, it's your nephew. - Yeah, might be a problem. - Hey boss, somebody's here to see you. - Who is it? - [Lou] I don't know. - Ask! - Who are you? Says his name is Bull. - The hit man? - You the hit man? He says yeah. - What does he want? - What do you want? Says he wants to talk. Says he's unarmed, raising up his pant legs, his sleeves, his jacket. - What'd he say now? - He said that don't you think if he came to kill you that the idiot at the door would be dead already? - Frisk him. - He's clean, boss. - Brock, why's this guy make you so nervous? - I've seen his work. - His work? It's time for him to see mine. - Okay, let him in, but you keep your gun on him. - Come in. Come in. - Hey hey. - [Brock] You're the Bull? - [Bull] Well I hope so, 'cause I got on this tight ass underwear. (laughing and mumbling) You seem a little disappointed. - Well I guess I was just looking for a more intimidating guy. I mean don't get me wrong, you're a pretty intimidating guy yourself, but I guess I was just looking for someone more like, I don't know, Sam? (ominous music) - Holy shit. - [Brock] Now that's intimidating. - Now that's a fucking gorilla. What you holding dog? Some 23s? - [Sam] 24. - That's my fucking girlfriend's waist size. The fuck you get this guy from? Shit, I want one. - [Brock] Sam's one of a kind. I met him about five years ago on a trip to England. He was head of security for the royal family. - Hmm. - [Brock] He has a black belt in 30 types of martial arts, a weapons expert, and he's licensed to carry a concealed weapon. - You're bullshitting. - Nope. - [Bull] Do you know how hard it is to get a concealed weapons permit? - That's the beauty of this guy. You just ask him for it and he makes it happen. - Well we'd like to test that theory a little later. - You can test it now. - Later. Mr. Bull, you are here because? - I'm here because of Mr. Cecil. - Cock sucking motherfucker. - Oh shit, you guys feel the same way about each other. - [Brock] Oh is that right? - Well actually what he said was you're a lowlife rat that would probably eat a piece of shit if you seasoned it right. (laughing) - How much longer you wanna listen to this shit? - [Brock] What'd he send you to talk to me about? - Well actually I lied, bro. (ominous music) He sent me to kill you. - [Brock] You're gonna kill me? - What am I supposed to do while you're doing that? - Well bro, actually you're the one that's gonna kill him. (laughing) - Boss, boss, they're gonna kill you. (laughing) Boss, he's gonna, oh shit. (laughing) (dramatic guitar music) - [Six] That's deep enough. Oh, this hot dog's kicking my ass. Alright buddy, let's get you going. - What the hell are you gonna do with that? - Look, don't ask questions that you don't wanna know the answer to. - I knew it, I knew it, you're one of them big old freaks, aren't ya? - What? - This is how you get off, huh? - What are you talking about, man? - What am I talking about? This is how you get your thrills, huh? This is how you get your turn ons? Every time you kill someone you stick that thing inside yourself? - Hey sick ass, what's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? You're the one walking around with an ass jabber in your hand and you're asking what's wrong with me. - Okay, okay, I didn't want to tell you this, and I figured you didn't wanna know. But you had to get stinkin' nasty. Your boss paid me a whole lot of extra money so that you would never be found again. Well if you are found, he wanted people to think that you're a fag. - Oh my God. - So after I kill you, I'm gonna put this dress on you and stick this in you. And like I said, he paid me a whole lot of extra money to do it. I didn't want to tell you this. I figured you didn't want to know. But again, you had to get stinkin' nasty. (farting) (farting) (farting and squishing) - You're just gonna shit in the same hole you're gonna put me in? - Sorry boss, I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. It's the fucking hot dog.

Let's get you going. - Aren't you gonna shoot me? - [Six] And get blood all over my car? And have to put this dress on your bloody body? Do you know how hard it is to get blood out? Man, that shit gets everywhere. All over you, all over your fingernails and everything. - Yeah, well that'll be interesting. - [Six] What? - Seeing that it's only one of you, how do you expect to get me in that hole and put me in that dress without killing me first?

Bobbie, Georgie, and Dougie the racist. - I'm not a racist. Oh you mean that wetback thing? I was just kidding. (gun cocking) - [Cutty] And the rap? - Oh that? You know man, those are just words. - Just words huh? - Yeah, words don't mean nothing. - Okay. I'm gonna test your theory. I'm gonna turn to Maria and say kill him. - Please don't do that. - [Cutty] Why, they're just words. - Because she's gonna kill me if you say that. - That's the point. Whether it be long term or short term, words can kill. - You racist bastard. - Yeah! - You guys are his buddies. And you know what they say? Walk like a duck, talk like a duck. - Must be a duck. - Now I was just thinking racists like to stereotype. So we're gonna play the stereotype game. Maria, what is something stereotypical that you have heard about white people? - They can't dance, they have no rhythm. - Very good. I don't think that's true, but it is a stereotype. Now I'm gonna give you guys a chance to prove that wrong. - How are you gonna do that? - We're gonna have a little dance contest. The winner gets to keep his life. And there are no runners up. - Look man-- - Dance! (upbeat music) Aw shit, sookie sookie now. Look at this motherfucker. I don't know Dougie, you're fitting the stereotype pretty significantly. You better step it up. Come on Dougie, come on, come on! Go Dougie, go Dougie, go Dougie! You ain't gonna make it. (gun firing) - Oh my God! - Oh Jesus. (whimpering) - Keep dancing! Shoot a motherfucker and everyone wanna start calling on Jesus. Put a bullet in somebody and everybody wanna start finding religion. Sorry boys, it don't work like that.

They say more heads are better than one. For your sake, I hope that's not true. (dramatic music) (gasping) - Let me get this straight, you come into my office insulting me, then you mention that half a fag Mr. Cecil, and that you're gonna kill me. - [Bull] Mm-hmm. - Is that correct, do I have everything straight? - That's about right. Oh except for the fact that your bodyguard's the one that's gonna kill you. - Amuse me. - [Bull] Forget him. - Okay Merlin. You don't mind if I call you Merlin? Because you have to be a fucking magician to pull this one off. - Well every magician's tricks are just well choreographed plans. Except for that motherfucker that be walking down the street floating. You ever see that guy? He walks down the street, he does a couple card tricks, the next thing you know this motherfucker just start floating on your ass. That motherfucker is possessed. - Oh yeah, I've seen that guy. Holy shit boss, it is amazing. Like he gets up so high, I've seen it on TV, I'm telling you-- - Just shut the fuck up, you fucking ashtray. - Boss, why you gotta call me an inanimate object? - Because you are an inanimate object. You are an ashtray, you are a rock, you are a block of cheese, you are a potato chip, you are a boot heel, you are a blinker. You are the gooey shit in the corner of my eye before I wash my face in the morning. Now out of all of those inanimate objects I just mentioned, none of them, I repeat none of them talk. So why don't you behave like a good little inanimate object and shut the fuck up? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry guys. I kinda gotta be somewhere. - Of course, you were going to explain your magic trick to us all. Please continue. - Okay, thank you. First thing they teach you in gangster school is don't be a creature of habit. And you two guys are exactly that. And you ask me how I know. I broke in here about two weeks ago, hid me a little camera right over there in the planter. - What's up with all this secret shit? Why don't you just come in here and blast? - I blast, you blast, stupid ass Lou starts blasting, noisy, messy, police. - So what, you watched us for two weeks. - Well you say if you know a man's habits, he's easy to get. Lou, you come in every morning about 8 o'clock, have yourself a big tall glass of milk and some cookies. Sam, coffee, bran muffin. Guess you're trying to stay regular. Mr. Brock, old Brockie poo. You don't really have a favorite morning drink. So I couldn't get you. - Okay, how? - You're gonna love this one. (upbeat drumming music) Poison. (dramatic music) I got this fuckin' poison off the internet. Odorless and tasteless. (laughing) The milk and coffee, I put it in the milk and coffee. - [Sam] Oh my God. - Oh no. (laughing) - I don't believe this fucking shit. - Don't believe it? Boo! - What'd you do that for? - Just had to get your heart rate up. Helps the poison work quicker. - Oh my God. Oh boss, boss I'm really gonna die, help me boss. I'm gonna die. - [Brock] Lou, are you scared? - Yeah. - [Brock] Is your heart beating fast? - Yeah. - [Brock] Do you feel anything? - No. - Of course you don't, he's bullshitting you. - He is? - Unfortunately, yes he is. Mr. Bull, you can't bullshit a bullshitter. - I'll break your fucking neck. - So you boys have no patience. - I'm tired of all this small talk. Let's just get rid of this asshole. - That was really wrong what you did to Lou. And for that, I think I'll let him shoot you. Lou, take care of him. (gagging) (choking) - Oh shit! - Sam, better watch that heart rate. (laughing) (yelling and convulsing) Hey Brock, I don't bullshit. And to show you that I don't bullshit, I got the antidote. (coughing) Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou. Hold on, hold on baby. (gasping) Throw it up, throw it up. There. (coughing) - Oh my God. What the fuck did you do that for? It hurt so bad, so fucking painful. - And they say that it feels like your insides are melting. - Nah, no, it's much worse than that. I'd rather be hit by a fucking bus again than go through that again. (coughing) - What the fuck is wrong with him now? - It's happening, it's happening, it's happening. Why's it happening again? - I can answer that, Lou. I only gave you one third of the antidote that you need. - Why did you do that? - I just wanted to show old Sam here that I do have the antidote and that it does work. (coughing) (game beeping) - Oh my God! - They say that shit is bad news. (chuckling) So, Sam. I guess it's time to test that theory. - What? - You know when Brock said just ask and you'll make it happen? (laughing) I'm fucking with you. Let me go get you this antidote, big man. You want me to get you the antidote? - Please hurry and get the antidote. - You know I need you to do something for me first though. You know what it is, don't you? What you think it is? - Kill Brock. - (laughing) Brock, you weren't kidding about this guy. This is one smart motherfucker. - Don't do it, Sam. (laughing) - Sam, I understand it's your job, but it's gone a little bit beyond that at this point. I mean, I'm gonna kill this little motherfucker anyway. Even if I have to do it with my bare hands. So he's doomed, and Sam really, do you think he would do it for you? - We'll work it out, Sam. - How the fuck you gonna work it out now I got the antidote? See that's what I'm talking about, he don't give a fuck about you. - That's not true, Sam. - Sam, you've got poison in your ass right now. - Shoot him! And take the antidote! - Brock, I ain't stupid. The antidote is in my car a few blocks away which brings up another fucking interesting point which is time and how little of it you have. Now if you don't wanna go through that excruciating pain like Lou here so eloquently described, it hurts, it feels like a bus hit you again, then you better G up and put a hole in this motherfucker. (dramatic music) - Sorry Brock. - Sorry Brock. (gun firing) Well done. Give me the gun, bro. - Please, hurry with the antidote. - Man, I didn't poison you. - What? Why? - Man, the motherfuckers on the internet, they only sent me enough for one person and that shit took three weeks to get here. That's why I hate ordering shit on the internet. - You mean. - I mean the only poison I used on you is my words. Have a nice day, bro.

I thought it was one. - It was at first, but now he wants us to watch his wife because he thinks there's gonna be an attempt on her life. - Who wants to smoke her? - Apparently his other boss. - Oh, while he's all into reserves, somebody trying to take historic possession, huh? - Exactly. - I'm here with the witness, I ain't babysitting though. - No shit, any chick I babysit, basically I'm fucking. And I'm just being real about that. - I figured you guys would feel like that, but I ain't got not problem making that extra 50. - So, (mumbling) with the witness. I ain't babysitting, cuz. - Hold up, I respect you, I really do. But you gonna have to find a way to quit cuzzing me, blood. - Dude, cuz why you all uptight and shit? You need a bran muffin or something. - I ain't all uptight, homie. All I'm saying is can't you just respect me and stop using that fucking word around me? - We just had that conversation. I'm a Crip, and every now and then it's gonna slip out. Start a feud again. - Well I tell you what. Every now and then I'm gonna fuck you up and you just gonna have to deal with that. - I guess I'm gonna deal with it, in my own way. - Six, if I have to fuck you up, the only way you're gonna deal with it is by saying ouch, help, get this nigga off me. - Homie, are we banging or moneymaking? - Moneymaking. - Moneymaking, always. - Like I said, how are you gonna help with the witness? Babysitting. - The witness is a gangster party. The babysitting is a side gig. And that's why I had my intern do it. - [Bull] Who? - Maria. (sighing) - Let's gangster. ♪ I just wanna one on one ♪ We just need to have some fun ♪ ♪ We can take a cruise for two ♪ I just wanna one on one ♪ I know you're working hard from nine to five ♪ - Why do you keep staring at me? - I was told to watch you. - I don't think they meant it literally. Besides, I can take care of myself. - Sure you can. - What is that supposed to mean? - It means a little rich girl like yourself can barely take care of making coffee. - I don't need to take this, I'm done with this. - Me too. - What is your problem? - I was told to keep an eye on you, okay? That means wherever you go, I go. Whatever you do, I do, I'm your shadow, get used to it. - Whatever. (smooth R&B music) Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I know you're just watching my back. - We're cool. (dramatic music) (groaning) (gun firing) - What the hell is going on? - Do you have a big pair of scissors? (coughing) Sylvia! - What? - A big pair of scissors, do you have any? - Yes, why? - Because we're going to cut his balls off. - What? Oh no we're not. - Look. We've gotta send these fuckers a message when they do something like this. - And? - And when you cut a guy's balls off, that makes them think you're psycho. - Yeah. - Yeah, and when they think you're psycho, then they think twice before doing something like this again. - [Sylvia] We're not cutting this guy's balls off. - Hello, this guy just tried to kill you. - It's not my balls cutting off day today, sorry. - It's really not that hard. All you have to do is just pull up the two little fuckers and just snip, snip, snip, snip-- - Maria! Thank you, but no thanks. - You sure? - I think the big corkscrew in his chest and the big bullet hole in his head is message enough. - Think so? - Yes, I think so. (upbeat rap music) - [Six] What's happening, cuz? - [Bull] Blood, you gonna get enough of cuzzing me. - I'm telling you, you tripping off that blood and cuz shit. - [Six] Fuck you Cutty. I'm gonna tell you the reason why. I just seen your ass fuck up some little ese dude who was spray painting all over your set. - That's because he's disrespecting the whole hood doing that shit. - Exactly, it's stupid, just as stupid as me and him tripping off cuz and blood shit. - It's a cycle. - What's that? - A cycle. - What do you mean? - Gang banging, shit is like brainwashing. The homies is like family. - Well mine was. - Mine too. - That's what I'm saying, most of us was brought up in single parent homes with one parent that was working, was working so fucking hard that you never even seen them. And that's when evil slips in. Here come the homies. Well what they consider love, support, protection, in a normal home, that's what the mother and father does. Now the homies is taking on the role of the mother and father. And where do we learn our normalcy from. - The mother and father. - The homies. - Exactly, so if the homies is Blood and Crippin', killing, doing drugs, whatever, to you it's normal. And now some motherfucker wanna roll up on you and tell you stop loving the homies, the homies is evil? They don't understand that you got mommy and daddy love for these niggas, dog! And how many motherfuckers you know you can roll up on and tell 'em stop loving your mother, your daddy is evil? And that's what they're up against, and that's what they don't understand. And it's gonna take more than a just slogan. - [Six] Just slogan? - Yeah you know, just do it, just say no. That shit may sell shoes but it don't save souls. - [Six] What do you think the answer is? - Blood, I dunno! - Cuz, you're the one getting all philosophical! - Motherfucker, if I didn't don't you think I'd be killing people for a living? - I think there's prevention. You got to get to them young. Because if you wait too long it'll be too late. And once they get like us, it's too late. (phone ringing) - Cutty. Someone just tried to bake a cake with big flour. - Really? Hold on. - Someone just tried to kill Sylvia. Well big or? - In house. Pretty sure. - Hey, who was it? - She thinks it might be someone in the organization. - Was he black, white, Spanish, or what? - Hey the Spiderman, is it vanilla, chocolate, or butterscotch? - Butterscotch. - Spanish. How are your cakes? - My cakes are good baby. - You get your cakes over to break in number three and you meet me there in 30 minutes. - I'm on my way. - Where we going? - Herman's lawyer's house. - Damn, you got a lawyer too, dog? - Me and Herman go way back. This is not just another job, this is my friend. - Is that where we get the cheese from though? - Yes. - Definitely. Let's go to the lawyer's house. (mellow hip hop beats) (dramatic Latin guitar music) - You know we're gonna do everything in our power to bring your husband, my friend, back home to you. (dramatic music) - Thank you, Francisco. I just miss him so much. He's my whole life. - I know. Hey. I know. (doorbell ringing) Excuse me. - Maria, do you want something to drink? - Oh yeah, of course. - Francisco, hi. Good to see you again my friend. - Indeed, indeed it is. - [Cutty] Francisco, this is Six. - Six. - [Cutty] And the Bull. - Bull. Gentlemen, please come in and sit down. Can I offer you guys something to drink? - [Six] Yeah, give me some 'nac. - Pardon me? - Cognac. - [Cutty] I'll have the same. - Okay, alright, three cognacs. - Damn Maria, you look fine as a motherfucker. - What's up, Bull? - What's up, Maria? - Thought you were gonna call. - [Cutty] Sorry. - [Six] I can call you, Maria. - I didn't ask you to call me, Six. - You didn't ask me not to call. - [Maria] Don't call me, Six. - Ain't that a bitch. Why are you all over his nuts? - [Maria] I don't get on nuts, okay? I cut 'em off. - You know she does. - And who are you? - This is Herman's wife Sylvia. - Damn, fine ones is always taken. - Oh, I'm sorry, ladies, did you want something to drink? - No. - No thank you. - Okay. - Hey, speak on the cheese. - Francisco, we need to talk about payment. - Of course. Ladies, would you please excuse us? - [Sylvia] Francisco, is everything okay? - Everything's fine. Okay, let me get the checkbook. - Francisco, did you just say checkbook? - Yes. - Hell no. - [Francisco] Excuse me? - I'm sorry, what my friend is trying to say is hell no! - Francisco, you know we only deal with cash on these things. - Yeah, look, when the FBI raided Herman's home, they found his safe and they confiscated all of the cash. All we have now is the Swiss accounts. Come on now Cutty, you know we're good for it, right? - Man, you considering this? - [Cutty] Come on man. - Cutty, what do I look like? A man that'll take cash only? Or a motherfucker that'd kill somebody than accept a check? Do you need a hint? (sighing) - Six, these people are my friends. They are men of respect and honor. If they say it's okay, it's okay. - Sir, sir, I assure you, you will get your money, okay? Look, all that we're gonna do here is write a check from our front company to your front company and say it's for supplies. You do have a front company, don't you? - [Cutty] I have one. - [Six] I have one. - Okay, well great. So who do I make the check out to? - [Six] Put it into my account. - That's okay, I trust you. - [Six] Yeah you better, 'cause I'm trusting you. (dramatic music) (upbeat hip hop beats) - Oh yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Oh yeah, I likes that, baby. Oh, take it off, baby, oh just like that yeah, damn. Ooh, that's good. Oh yeah, take it off baby, take it off. Oh yeah. - Asshole! - [Al] You know you like it! - Cut it out, Al. - What? Hey Walter, you see the rack on that one? - No comment. - Steve, you look like a tit man, what'd you think? - I think we should keep it professional, Al. - What are you, a faggot or something? - Hey watch your mouth, Al. - Let me get this straight. We got four guys in a small space here, right? Then we get a hot chick in there with a nice pair of tits and all you can say to me is let's keep it professional, Al? Well Al says you're a fucking faggot. - Come on, keep testing me. - We don't need this, Al. - I've been watching this fucking guy, man. - What do you mean you've been watching me? - [Al] Why'd you turn the heat up earlier? - 'Cause I was cold. - Yeah right. - What do you mean, yeah right? I was cold so I turned up the heat. - You sure you didn't want it to get nice and toasty in here, huh? Maybe a little too toasty so maybe we'd start taking off our shirts? - What? - Hey, what does the FBI mean to you, huh? Fart box insurer? - Hey, hey, take it easy, take it easy guys. (knocking on door) (guns cocking) Who's there? (birds chirping) All clear. - Well maybe it was some kid or something. - Yeah. Hey maybe it was the Village People looking for their construction worker, huh? - Look, I'm not gay you asshole. - [Al] I know, you're not gay. But your boyfriend is. - Look, I'm getting sick of this shit. (struggling and yelling) - Who is in charge? - Hey, whoa. Hey whoa. - [Walter] Who are you? - You better say something fast before I blow your fucking head off, buddy. - Al, shut up, who are you? - Agent 55, witness protection. - [Walter] Show me some ID. - Slowly! - Al, shut up! Why are you yelling? - Intimidation factor. - You're not intimidating little man, please, speak in your inside voice. - Agent 55, we've been waiting for you. - No shit, it's about time. - Where's the witness? - She's in the bathroom. - Why's there no one watching her? There's no one watching her? - Hey I tried watching her. - You guys are amateurs. Let's go. - Get out of here you pervert. Can't you see I'm trying to take a bath? - You can either stay in here and take a bath and die or come with me and live. (groaning) - [Al] Hey, what's the rush, buddy? - My rush is this witness is being hunted by professional assassins who think killing is a job. And they're open for business. And business seems to be pretty good. - [Bill] No one knows where we are. - Someone always knows, someone always talks. That's why government invented me. Time to go, I suggest you guys do the same. - Man, the DA's on his way to get the witness's statement. - Henry Valentine? - Yeah. - Tell him to meet me at the same place we met for the Rosenberg case, he'll know where it is. - Man, that guy takes his job way too fucking seriously. Hey Bill, want to play some blackjack? - Alright. - Deal me in. - Steve, you wanna play or what? - He wants to play five card stud. (laughing) (dramatic hip hop music) - Shit. - What is it? - (mumbling) They're here. - Who? - [Steve] The hit men! - What's your problem, fudge packer? - What? - There's no one out there, Steve. Where'd they go? - [Walter] Where did who go? - What, did your ex boyfriend slap you around a bit too much, huh big guy? - I'm tired of your shit. - Hey! (men mumbling and struggling) (gun firing) - The FBI, oh shit. (laughing) - Would you highly skilled professionals mind putting your guns on the table? (whistling) Cutty? - Hey get over there on the couch. - [Bill] All of us? - What, are you special or something? - No, I'm just saying it's a love seat. - What's that mean? - Well it's designed only for two people. We could take a chair on put one on either side and then two people could sit in the chairs and two people could sit on the love seat. - And I'm not sitting next to him. - Go on, get your asses over on that couch before I start blasting. - So. You know why we're here, right? - We ain't got no idea. (gun firing) - So, you know why we're here, right? - [All] The witness. - [Six] Party coordinator. - [Bill] What? - What do we do? (groovy music) - Well, DA's on the way over, you should kidnap him. I'll answer the door, you wait in the bushes, and you get him from behind. (groaning) - Ow! What are you doing? - Where did you get this? - The store! - When? - I don't remember. - When? - I don't remember! Lighten up. - If I lighten up, you die. You don't eat or drink anything unless I say so, you understand? Do you understand? - Yes! (dramatic music) I'm hungry. - Here. - What's this, wood chips? - That's all natural granola. - It looks like wood chips. Tastes like wood chips. - Oh shit, that is the, oh, that's wood chips. - Oh my God! - This is granola. - Asshole. - Oh, I'm just trying to lighten up. (dramatic music) Get in the car, get in the car. Get in the car! - [Karyn] Why? - [Agent 55] Get in there. - Well look who's just in time for the festivities. (laughing) - Where's the DA? - There's some of him. (laughing) - Where's my witness? - That's what you're just in time for. (whimpering) - [Karyn] Please! Please! (phone ringing) - Don't worry honey, it ain't gonna hurt. I'm a professional. - Wait! - What? - The check bounced. - You're bullshitting. - I don't understand. - You don't understand? These are my friends. They are men of integrity, honor, and respect. - I don't believe this. Look, let's just do the hit and I promise you, you'll get your money. - No, ain't nothing happening til we get paid first, homie. - What are we supposed to do, ride around with them? - Yeah. - But we can't ride around with two people tied up in the backseat of the car. - Homie, homie, I'm with Six on this one. I mean, we trusted you, your friends fucked up. I ain't mad at you dog but I'm with my boy Six on this one. - Well I'm mad at you, so you need to call your honorable friends and tell them if they don't have my money I'm gonna walk this bitch in the courtroom myself. - [Karyn] Who you calling a bitch? - [Six] What? - [Karyn] I said, who you calling a bitch? - [Six] You, bitch! - [Karyn] I ain't no bitch. - You better shut up. - [Karyn] I'll shut up, but I ain't no bitch. - Say something else. Some one more damn word and I swear, I'll donate a killing! - Let's just go back to my place and we'll work this out. - Alright, let's roll. (dramatic hip hop music) Watch your head. Ooh, shit. Cutty you be having some ball ass knives. I wanna kill a motherfucker with this, homie. Where you get this shit from? - Don't do that. - Alright. Hey you got something to eat? - Sit down and shut up! Cutty, call your boy and get this shit handled. - Wait a minute, you need to hold up. - Hold on, (speaking quickly). - Hold up motherfucker. Be coming over to my house, barking orders at me? And I know my boys fucked up and I'm gonna fix that. But right now, you need to slow your roll, Six. - You hear that shit, Bull? - [Bull] You are being kinda disrespectful, dog. - But the check bounced! - I understand that, that's why I see your point. But I'm sure the homie will make sure we get paid, right? - Are you Swiss or something? Why you gotta always be neutral? - I ain't Swiss or nothing, I'm just saying, I'm sure the homie gonna make sure we get paid. - Exactly. (dramatic music) - Yeah. You're all crazy as shit. I swear, I'll fucking shoot everybody in the fucking house. - What you talking about, Six? - Talking about y'all passing a box of cheese and shit. Fuck that, I'm gonna get mine, cuz. Why you bomb on me, Bull? - I bombed on you for two reasons. One, I told you to quit cuzzing me. Two, you talking about shooting everybody in the motherfucking house. I'm in the house, so you're talking about shooting me. So fuck you. - Six, just look at it like you got fucked, and you got handled, and it's over. - I can do that. Make that your last time you bomb on me, fool. - I can do that. - Let me call my people. Tonight we're gonna take care of it, okay? Everything's gonna-- - Wait, hold on. Can I give my bomb back? - What? - Can I give my bomb back? - Fool, I'm not gonna just sit here and let you hit me. - We're friends right? - Yeah. - Well, I think I was taken advantage of. And the only way we can remain friends is you let me give my bomb back. So can I give my bomb back? - Alright, but don't be trying to hit me-- - Thank you, now Cutty, what was you saying? - What I was saying was tonight I'm gonna handle everything, okay? Everything-- (knocking on door) Who is it? (dramatic music) - [Man] Delivery for Bobby Argoza. - [Cutty] What is this? - I just deliver 'em, buddy. (grunting) That sure is a big box. I had to carry that thing all the way up the stairs myself. Damn. (groaning) But anything for the customer. - [Six] You want a tip? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - It's customary. - [Six] Why don't you tip your ass out the door before I take this nine and start putting a few bullets in your ass? - Oh, thank you! - The fuck is this? - So, I see you're pretty good at this witness protection thing, huh? Let's see, first, you feed me wood chips. Then you get us kidnapped. And from what I gather, the only thing that has kept us alive for a few hours longer is a bounced check. Now unless you made that check bounce, I suggest you make a serious career change. - I'll get us out of this. - Oh, you will? Well if you can shit out a miracle, I suggest you take some Ex-Lax because we need one right now! (grunting) - Who the fuck is this? Herman? Oh, that's some crazy shit, that's some crazy shit homie. You mailed yourself out of prison! - [Cutty] Are you okay? - Yes, yes, I'm okay. - [Cutty] How long you been in there? - Two days, I should have overnight myself. - How the fuck did you mail yourself out of prison? - Prison has a program for its trustees. Fix appliances such as refrigerators, washers, dryers, et cetera. They fix 'em, and once they get good at it, they let them do it for money and the major appliance companies send them their broken appliances to fix for about $2 an hour, we fix them, and then they mail them back. One of my loyal men works on the inside. He set the whole thing up. - Brilliant. - Definitely. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, very clever, Jack in the box. My question is, what's up with the bounced check? - Cutty, what is this rude man talking about? - The check Francisco gave us bounced. - What check? You're supposed to be paid in cash. - He says the FBI got all the cash. And then that was the way. We got the witnesses tied up in the back room. As soon as we get paid, we can finish up. - My wife okay? - She's fine, I got one of my people watching her right now. - Thank you, my friend. Alright let's get back to my house and I'll get your cash. - Man, that's the first place they'll be looking for you. - No, I have a secret house that only my wife and me know about, that's where I keep the money. - You guys wanna wait til I get back? - Hell no. - Uh-uh. - I'm going to the cheese. - Look, we all go, we take the witnesses, we get the cheese, and we handle the witnesses, and we out. - I'm with that. - That okay with you? - Yeah, that's fine with me. - I'll go get the truck from around back. - Bathroom? Bathroom. (dramatic music) - [Herman] I'll be right back. I have to keep my safe a secret. - I understand. - Can you call your people, tell them to have my wife meet me over here. - Yeah, sure. (upbeat rock music) Maria. Maria slow down, what happened? - She's gone, Sylvia's gone. - What happened? - I came out of the bathroom and she was gone. - How long ago? - About an hour. - How, why did you wait so long to call me? - I was trying to find her because I didn't want you to be mad at me. - Get your ass over here right now. - You're not mad at me, are you? - Maria, just get your ass here. We're at 2343 Oak Street off of Main. - What's wrong? - Sylvia's missing. (mumbling) What's he trying to say? - What are you, what are you trying to say? - That car has been following us ever since we left your place. - [Bull] Back there? - Why are you trying to help us? They're probably the feds. - They're not the feds. Whoever it is is coming to get everybody in this van. You guys aren't very good at this, are you? - Shut the fuck up. - Who do you think it is? - I think it's the feds. - [Bull] Nah, if it was the feds he wouldn't have warned us. He'd just let 'em sneak up on us. - Then who is it? - I don't know, let's just sit tight for a minute. - [Cutty] Fuck. (funky music) ♪ Guilty is written all over your face ♪ ♪ The lies you can never erase ♪ Said that it was once never twice ♪ - [Herman] Sylvia. - Herman. Jesus. - [Herman] How could you? (dramatic music) - Girl's gotta look out for her best interests. - Let's face it, Herman, you got weak. That's why your own organization is trying to overthrow you. - And I'm not going down with you, Herman. You got me used to the finer things in life and I'm not going back. - But don't you love me? - I loved that strong, independent, ambitious man you used to be. - Do you love me? - Actually, I hate everything about you. - Baby, baby go get dressed. - Okay, what should I wear? - Go put on some traveling clothes, okay? 'Cause we're gonna get out of here. - Okay. - So Herman, how did you get out? - You should be worried about how I'm going to kill you. - Am I missing something here, Herman? I have the gun. (Herman mumbling) See, see, that's the problem Herman. You don't know when you're licked. You don't know when to walk away. It's all over for you. Herman, I got your gun, I got your money, I got your girl. - Everything you just mentioned has been my curse. Those three things have put me in the situation I'm in right now. Standing in front of a man with a gun ready to take my life. And I will gladly give my life. Because of the loss of those three things, I pass this curse onto you. And soon you will find yourself in the same situation. - [Sylvia] How's this, baby? - It's beautiful, baby, you better go get the money. Herman, listen to me. If you try to follow us, I'm sorry Herman, I'm gonna have to kill you. - Whoa wait, what do you mean? You know you have to kill him, right? - Let me handle this okay? - Baby, I'll let you handle it. But you know you have to do this. - Look at him, baby, look, he's a man on the run, okay? He's got no money, he's got no gun, he can't hurt us. - Francisco, don't be an idiot. He'll figure out a way to find us and kill us. What is wrong with you? - I'm thinking, baby, okay? I'm not a killer. - It's not about killing, it's about surviving. If you don't kill him, he kills you. - She's right, Francisco. I will find you and kill you. On the other hand, you're right, you're not a killer. So what do you do? (dramatic music) - See, he's getting in your head. - Be quiet, okay? - Better do it, you'd better pull that trigger 'cause if you don't I will hunt you down and gut you like the swine you are. - I'll do it. - No, no, no! (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Oh, oh Herman, listen to me, Herman. Herman, I wasn't gonna shoot you. Herman, I really wasn't gonna shoot you. You know that, right? Herman? (whimpering) You know I really wasn't gonna shoot you. - I know. (gun firing) (groaning) (somber music) (dramatic music) (sobbing) She's gone. - What happened? We heard gunshots. - [Herman] She's gone. (sobbing) (dramatic music) (mumbling through gags) - Where are they now? - [Herman] They're upstairs. - Did you get the money? What? - I'll go get the money. You guys have to put him in the car for me. - Remember me? Don't even try it. - What the fuck is that? - That's a Sam. - Is he a good guy or a bad guy? - We're all bad guys. - Is he a bad guy or a worse guy? - Definitely a worse guy. - You killed Brock. - [Bull] First of all bro, what the fuck are you wearing? - Why don't you come take it off of me? - That's alright dog, keep it on. Sam, it was just a paycheck bro, get over it. - I am over it. When Brock's friends hired me to kill you, I gladly accepted. - Maria! (gun firing) No! (guns firing) (dramatic rap music) (guns firing) (sirens blaring in distance) - Maria, Maria! Maria! Maria! (engine starting) - What you doing dog? - I'm over here bleeding to death. (laughing) - Me too. Shit. I'm cold (mumbling). - I'm freezing. - I know we ain't got that much longer. (stuttering) - Why do you say that? (laughing) - We're out in the desert, 95 degrees, and we talking about we cold. (laughing) Hey. Alright then, cuz. - (mumbling) blood. (wind howling) (dramatic music) - Sylvia. (gun firing) (upbeat music) - So did you have all that planned? - To the T. (laughing) - You must have gone through some intensive training to be tied up with a gag in your mouth and watch those guys shoot each other up. - Very intense training, (mumbling). (laughing) (speaking quickly under music and rocks crunching) (upbeat rap music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
