You see it's marked there? Yeah. Okay now, these two, this ones comes from the condenser And this one comes from the resister over here. They go on the positive side. And you tighten it down, and put your coil wire back in. Just pop it back in. The white boot goes on the distributor cap. And another one goes on the coil. All right. It's pretty easy. Yeah, nothing to it. [PHONE RINGING] It's probably Garth. He probably wants to know where the car is. What should I tell him? Tell him the truth. Tell him I left fifteen minutes ago.

Because here, I am God. That sounds fair to me, Lloyd. Hey pal, we've been through enough together, well you can call me Joe. 'Cause where we've been, somebody else is playing God. So don't you think it's only right that everybody gets a shot at it? Well, I haven't thought about it that much. Well, won't you think about it? You know how's Jeff? Did they win that soccer game on Wednesday? I got blown away, Jeff. How'd your little brother do? What do you mean how'd he do? I just told you, he'd zipped. How could he have done? Probably a lot better if he wasn't running around in those raggedy sneakers. Here. Give him a mad hatter happy on birthday from his uncle Joe. Thanks a lot, Joe. Hey. What are friends for? What is he? Fifteen and a half now? Yeah, he just got his learner's permit. I'm gonna take him for a run tonight. Solo with the kid. Good luck. Hey... Fifteen and a half... I can vaguely remember when we were fifteen. Hey, remember when we used to ride around? Cruising and listening to the sounds of the Four Tops? ♪ Sugar pie honey bunch ♪ You know that I love you ♪ Come on, Rick, jump in on this part. ♪ I can't help myself ♪ Now come on, I'm running late. Where's those parts you got for me? Right here. ♪ I'm a fool in love with you ♪ Yeah, thanks again for the gift, Joe, Jeff's really gonna like it. Yeah, I hope so. Should be able to run with traction from the bottom of his shoes. You know what's the thought and all that. Yeah well, he's a good kid. I like him a lot. Yeah. He's been pretty good with the cars too. We cannot go after duty. It's in the genes. He's taking out his big brother. He's gonna become a Greasemonkey. Nah, I hope not. Yeah, well. He's smart. You're doing a great job raising him man. Yeah, I'm trying anyway. I'll see you later. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! This beats are great! Tell Joe thanks. Hey, come here. Take a pass. Nah, forget it. I grew up on baseball. It's the same thing. Only you use your feet. Why don't you put that away now? Hey, when are we going driving? When you finish your homework. Did you do it? Sort of. What do you mean sort of? I did most of it. Now do all of it. Come on. The truck will still be there when you finish. Now go on, move. Clear off the table and do the dishes. Great. Paper plates. I'd rather have you do my home work. JEFF: Come in. How is it going? Slow. You need any help? Thanks anyway. This place is in a mess. Am I supposed to clean up my room too? That way, we'll never get out of here. Maybe that's what you want, huh? Look, I told you I'd take you driving. What's your problem? The problem? The problem is, you've been promising we'd be going driving for three straight nights now. And we're over three. I can't help it if something comes up. No, some thing's always gonna come up if we wait around long enough. Look, if you don't wanna go, why don't you just say so? I do wanna go, Jeff. Yeah right. You're afraid I'm gonna crack up your truck. Look, why don't we just forget about it? I just can't believe, you're old enough to drive already. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. That's how it all starts. You start taking the truck up, picking up girls. Leaving me at home to wash the paper plates while you are out raising hell, I know. Hey, we can raise hell together. In fact, we can pick up girls together. You could use a little brush up on your technique. Yeah. Who's gonna take care of you while all I'm doing is going out? Who'll make you those great dinners? Great dinners? [CHUCKLES] Hey look. I'm old enough to take care of myself. And I'm old enough to drive. Yeah, you're right. All right. What do you say, you junk that homework for a while? I'll take you for a spin. Yeah? Yeah, come on. Let's go. You got your learner's permit? Wallet and everything? Yeah. I got it. I'll take it up on all of you and give you shift-work out in the hills, okay? Okay. Fasten your seat belt. Okay. Are you sure you got your learner's permit? Yes. You got your wallet and everything? Yes! Relax! All right. I'm relaxed. Like a good cop. All right. Put the clutch all the way in. Here we go. So, what did they teach you in driver's ed so far? Nothing much. They show us weird films. Bodied all messed up. That kind of stuff. Yeah. That's good. They show you that stuff for a reason. [CAR SCREECHING] What are you doing? That's a yellow light. That means caution. Not hit it! Sorry. So what else have they been teaching in that class? They talk a lot about drunk driving. That is important. If you wanna drink, you don't drive. Above the alcohol level of .05. Uh huh. Wrong, pal. 00 for you. If I find booze, you booze. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] So, when can I drink and go out with girls? You can't drink and drive. Period. Girls, that's your own problem. That's no problem. Keep it up and it will be. Now listen, the most important thing you got to realize about driving is that you gotta drive defensively. Always watch for the other guy and don't assume or anything. Even if you got the ride away, Don't insist on it. You got that? Hey, that's Susan Neville Remember how we worked on her 'Vet this afternoon? Susan Neville's Hot Spot? I like this show. She's pretty good. Pretty good or pretty cute? Cute? Women aren't cute, Jeff. Girls are cute. Oh ho ho ho. Touchy, touchy. She must be cute. Mind your own business, will you? Watch the road. Yes, sir. Try down shifting. All the way on the clutch. Here you go. Pull it back. All right. It's all right. You're doing good. Piece of cake. Hey, how about some sounds? Just drive, will you? Please. Yes, boss. That guy is pretty close. Yeah. Why don't you slow down? Let him pass. Woah! What do I do? Take it easy. Take it easy. Just keep driving. Just keep it on the road. Don't panic. No! Aah! Mr. Benton. Can you hear me? It's all right. Don't try to talk. Just... Nod, if you can hear me. Mr. Benton, you've been in a coma so, don't try to move. Where's Jeff? It's important that you remain still. Where's Jeff? Tell me. Where is he? Jeff didn't make it. Get out of here. Now, it's important at this stage that you not over exert yourself. Go on. Get the hell out of here. Sometimes, you have to look at things and sign out. It's not always as it seems on the surface. See, death is a part of the great plan. It's like... Like something good will come your way because of it. Something... You were meant to learn what to... The... Ebb and flow of karma. Something good will come of this. I know it sounds crazy. But you'll see. Something good will come of this. I uh... I loved him man. I loved him too... JEFF: This guy is pretty close. What do I do? RICK: Take it easy. Just keep driving. Keep it on the road. Don't panic. JEFF: This guy is pretty close. What do I do? RICK: Take it easy. Just keep driving. Keep it on the road. Don't panic. Don't panic. JEFF: What do I do? I'm telling you. He came out of no where. He rear ended us. He kept banging in to the truck. Do you recognize him from any place else? Do anything to antagonize or provoke him? Provoke him? You got to get this straight. I never saw the guy before. He's just some drugger or pill head or something. Then it could have been unintentional. He's trying to pass you, You swirl about, he swirls in No! He was trying to kill us. He came right at us. He killed my little brother. You have my sympathies Mr. Benton. Professionally said. Look. This happens in my division every night. Some guys drunk. Some body else is at the wrong place at the wrong time. And it looks like murder. It is murder. That's why they call it the hit killer homicide. I... I will try to nail these knots. But its not... Anyway, I've got your description with the guy and the car and I promise you, we will do our best. So that's it, huh? I'm sorry. Mr. Benton, I know how you feel. You don't know anything. Go on, get out of here. Get lost. I wish we could have made more progress, Rick. Yeah, I know. I think we've only broken through the surface of your dealing with what happened. I hope you'll come back to the clinic as we discussed. May be we could find some constructive way... Constructive way to what? Well, you are going back to work, aren't you? Yeah. That's good. We've got you scheduled to go to a meeting for citizens for highway safety tonight. I know it'll be helpful. Yeah, if I go You really should go. What is it, a condition to my parole? Oh, that's not it at all, Rick. I'm trying to help you. Yeah I know. I'm sorry. Organization can be very useful. You can gain a lot by relating to people who have similar problems. All right. Yeah sure. I'll go. Good. Bye. Bye. [BALLAD MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back, pal. Thanks a lot, Joe. Hey man, don't thank me. The truck fairy did it. I put your wrecked rig under my pillow, woke up the next morning. Presto! Hey... You're gonna hang around the house all day? You wanna go get something to eat? Look, I'll even pay for it. Huh?

Really. Anyway... I went there, I saw the ambulance there. We went to the hospital. But it was too late. Way too late. I couldn't have done anything. Nothing. But, maybe before, I could have told her not to go with that kid. I didn't know him that well. He was just some kid in her class. Kid, driving her around, drunk. Driving with my daughter in his car. Thank you David. Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to talk now? Well... For those of you who are new to the citizens for highway safety, welcome. Many of us in this room tonight most of us, myself included. Are the victims of drunk drivers. The living victims. An average of 70 people are killed in United States, by drunk drivers each day. That's one person dead every 21 minutes. What are we gonna do about it? We are gonna try to stop it. No. I mean, what are we gonna do about it? Tonight. If people are gonna be killed out on those streets. Just like my son was killed By some maniacs. Some doped up maniac. But what are we gonna do tonight? To stop those killers, to save those victims. Tragically tonight, yes. The deaths will all continue. But in the long run, with all of your help, may be we will stop it. And get those drunk drivers, especially repeaters, off our roads for good.

But they already know that the Gladiator called in on the police frequency to report those arrests. Who the hell told them that? Who told 'em? A little birdie. If you see a little birdie around anywhere, you tell him from me, I'm gonna step on his head. I do not want any official acknowledgment of this Gladiator business. You got that? If we are nice and quiet, and we don't give this guy the publicity he's looking for, he goes away.

MAN ON RADIO: And now, back to Hot Spot. with Susan Neville. Hello. You're on Hot Spot. MAN 1: Hello, Susan. My name is Steve. Hi, Steve. I'd like to talk about the Gladiator. Yeah, you and everybody else wants to know. What's on your mind? Yeah, well. I'd like to know, what's the difference between this Gladiator and acting all crazy that you see all the time in the movies? Going out on a revenge rampages, strapping bullets across their chests, and toking bazookas. Huh? 'Cause I don't think there's any difference if you want to know my opinion. Well, I do want your opinion, Steve. That's why you're on air. Yeah, well. Anyway. I think this guy have to be locked up. Sent to some prison in a jungle somewhere. And wait it out, to some band of movie stars trenches in the rocky mountain. And that's gonna be a long wait. The Gladiator has been watching too much garbage, eating too much pop corn. That's all I got to say. Thank you, Steve. Well, we've had so many callings on this one topic tonight that I've decided to devote tomorrow's night show to the Gladiator. Chromed crusader or a public menace. Until tomorrow night, this is Susan Neville on Hot Spot. No problem. Every time we buy food for that cat, it costs a small fortune. Don't talk about poor kitty like that! What the... Hey! Watch out for that car! MAN ON RADIO: A trip to the market proved fatal for a Pacoima couple tonight. When a blown tire caused a fiery collision at laurel canyon and paxton. Still unexplained by police the extensive rear end damage to the car which may indicate a second vehicle was involved. No witnesses have come forward. In stock market news, the market took a tremendous up swing today, sending trading through the roof for an all time high. So what you've been doing man? Demolition derbies or what? Yeah, something like that. Something like that. So, what does that mean? You don't want to talk about it? All right. Let's talk about this. How are things going with Hot Spot? Seeing her tonight. You seeing her tonight? Yup. That's great. That's great! You need to get out a little be more man. Sort of... Broaden your worldly horizon beyond your own garage door. Yeah, right. If you know, what I mean. All right. Thanks for the help. Thanks. What you talking about man? You becoming my best customer. Hey, you take care of yourself. All right. I'll see you later. You got it. Ah, come on baby. Sweet and sour pork. No. Wrong again. I'm not much of an expert on Chinese food. Uh huh. Mr. I hate Cantonese. Come on now. Close your eyes. No, I give up. Just do it. Okay. Re-fried beans. No. Come on. Close your eyes. Let's try again. Again? Mm Hmm. Close your eyes. All right. I don't know what it is. But, I like it. Do you mind if I ask you something? No, go ahead. Why won't you tell me about your wife? I don't like talking about my mistakes. You couldn't have been that bad. No. Maybe not. Just seems like it some times. Well, how long have you been separated? Couple of years. What happened? She wanted to settle down. Have some kids. Well, what's wrong with that? Nothing. I've been taking care of Jeff since I was 18 years old. And she really helped me a lot with him. Just wasn't ready yet. And what about the ring? Maybe some day, I will be ready. REPORTER: Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Was it... Do you think there's a link between this incident and the recent rise in the hit and run deaths in this area? LIEUTENANT: We haven't established that though. Well, you certainly wouldn't support the conclusion that this was an accident. LIEUTENANT: I have to wait for the evidence. REPORTER: What is the possibility that this is the work of the man who's calling himself, the Gladiator? LIEUTENANT: I won't be able to comment on that either. You know? REPORTER: Lieutenant, there's a lot of people who feel that what the Gladiator is doing is right. How would you respond to them? LIEUTENANT: He's breaking the law. Breaking the law. Defense of the law, silly! Vigilante justice isn't justice at all. Who makes the rules when they aren't any rules? Who says, where the line gets drawn? Guys walking run him over. Literally cut his hand off. He's a drunk driver. Run him off the road. Let me lay this out for you. Clear. Simple. Nobody's above the law. Just like always. No body. That's it. Lieutenant Frank... I'm sure getting tired of all this. This whole thing is incredible. It's all my callers want to talk about. Now the media is trying to turn this guy into some kind of a hero. Maybe he is. Why? 'Cause he is fighting something worth fighting against. Yeah what? Pulling drunks off the road. Very dangerous drivers. The Gladiator is more dangerous than anyone who is pulling off the road. He is the worst kind of criminal. Making himself out to be some kind of a crusader, breaking every law in the book. I think, he's just out for kicks. For kicks? No way. The guy out there doing what he is doing, he's probably got a good reason. Like what? Like, saving lives? You know if the Gladiator was out the night my brother got killed, maybe that wouldn't have happened and he'd still be here. Look, Rick. I'm really sorry. No. Forget it. I'm sorry. Look, it's getting late and you got your show, I got stuff I got to do. I better get going. Well, Look. Give me a call. Okay? All right. I will. You promise? Yeah, I will. Be careful. ♪ I'm just a snow girl ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm... ♪ [CRASHING] We'll make it out, we'll make it. MAN 1: What the heck is going on? Hey! Hey! Hey! Go! Stop! What are you doing? Hey, buddy! Hey! No! Oh! No! Stop! I swear, I'll never drink again! No, not again. No. Please. No! Stop! Get outta here! Get outta here! [RADIO PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] RADIO: A tragic accident in Arleta left two men dead this afternoon. Apparent victims of the same hit and run driver, who police speculate maybe linked to other south land accidents. There were no witnesses in the day light crash in which the victims were apparently forced off the road and under the truck bed of a semi - trailer. Another hit and run fatality. That makes ten this month. We got a psycho in our hands? Check this report. That man and his wife, run off the road? Saw the car. Garage is holding what's left of it. Pulled this out of one of those wheel hubs. The tires was slashed to shreds by that razor tip. Some kinda spirit. Must have broken off during the attack. The spear? That's what they said. Gizmos. Gladiator. We got a dozen of reports, ID and his truck with these kinda stuff. I wouldn't put spiked wheels past him. Same guy? Wow. His hit and run started about the same time he showed up. What should we put out on the radio? Nothing. I don't want to scare him off and I don't want to encourage him if it's the same guy. Gladiator is supposed to be out there stopping this kinda thing. Maybe not. Maybe he's Jekyll and Hyde. JEFF: This guy is pretty close. What do I do? RICK: Take it easy. Take it easy. Just keep driving. Keep it on the road. Don't panic. JEFF: This guy is pretty close. What do I do? RICK: Take it easy. Take it easy. Just keep driving. Keep it on the road. Don't panic. Don't panic. JEFF: What do I do? SUSAN: Good evening. This is Susan Neville on the Hot Spot. Tonight's show will be devoted solely to the Gladiator. The Gladiator's publicize nightly patrols have capture the public imagination like no one since the lone ranger. The blarer, the horn, the screech, the break it gets, the bad guys off the road and vanishes into the night. Without so much as a hi ho silver. Hot rodder, drunk drivers speeders. Any out there is fair game for this self appointed one man army. Was that all there is to the story? I for one join all concerns citizens and the police in deploring the actions of this so called crusader. Now, I'd like to hear from you. Hello, you're on Hot Spot. WOMAN: Well, I don't know who this Gladiator guy thinks he is. But now, I'm afraid to walk the streets at night. I don't care if he thinks he is protecting me or not. I want to let him know I can protect myself from people like them. Because once you let it start, then who's gonna say When they're protecting you, and when they're just nuts like everybody else? There's a whole trend in this country. Are people taking the war on their own hands? I mean you think you're gonna get attacked, so what you do? You shoot. And then, what if you find out the person you're shooting was just going to ask you for a dime? Is there any reason to get shot? Or maybe he just wanted to say &quot;hi.&quot; Didn't we used to work some where... I don't know. This whole place is going crazy. You! Pull over! Pull over! Now! You are under citizen's arrest for reckless driving. What are you talking about? I'm trying to get my wife to the hospital. She's pregnant you stupid jerk. You didn't kill the kid we're lucky. Now get this the hell out of the way. It's a gray truck, you know? I mean, just an open bet. That guy wasn't even so big. Less than six feet. Brown hair. Look, I don't think this guy was the Gladiator. Now, what makes you think that this was not the Gladiator? He said it was a citizen's arrest, didn't he? No. This guy was insane. He wasn't some kind of do gooier. He was raving. Wild eye. Like he wanted to kill me. Like he wanted to run down me and my wife and kill us both. Okay. Thank you very much for you're help.

Wanna meet near Pink's cafe? Yeah, all right. That will be real good. I'll see you then. All right. Bye. I was out there driving around tonight. Thinking about Jeff. I haven't thought about what happened in a long time. Guess he wasn't that much to think about it. You know, sometimes, you think you're doing the right thing and it screws up. Everything goes wrong and... It's getting so deep that you can't get yourself out of it. You just can't stop. Go on. And I started thinking about what you said. You know what everybody's been saying about the Gladiator. Maybe the reasons he's been doing what he's been doing and wrong sometimes. He's more trouble than he's worth. You know, even those guys on the road. Well, don't be afraid. Afraid of what? About what you started talking about. Nah, it's not the easiest thing in the world. I know it's sad. But... If you deal with your hurt and your anger you talk about it... My anger? I have been dealing with my anger. It's really scaring the hell out of me. What? I'm over the line, Susan. I'm way over the line. Lieutenant Mason please. This is lieutenant Mason. Who is calling please? This is Rick Benton. We met before at the hospital. After my brother was killed. Yes, Rick.
