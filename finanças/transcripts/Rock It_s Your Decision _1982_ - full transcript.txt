♫ I wanna say ♫ To everyone here today it's true ♫ We're gonna have a good time ♫ We're gonna have a good time ♫ We're gonna have a good time ♫ We're gonna have a good time Alright. Real good time. Whoo! - [Woman] Jeff. I'm sick and tired of telling you to turn that junk down! Now turn it off. - [Jeff] Oh Mom, get off my back. A guy can't get any privacy around here. ♫ Can't walk on water ♫ Got a ball and chain - Jeff! (cars honk horns) (phone rings) Hello. - Jane? - [Jane] Yes. - I won't be able to catch the early flight home. So don't expect me until tomorrow. - Did everything go alright? - I'm afraid that Mr. Phillips didn't accept our new proposal. I'll fill ya in on it when I get home. How's everything there? - Oh Jeff and I had another blow up about his music. He left for church in quite a huff. Really Arthur, I just don't know what we're gonna do about it. His attitude is getting worse and worse. - Did you try talking to him again? - No, talking does no good. I think maybe I'll call his youth pastor, Jim Owen. Maybe he'll be able to remind Jeff what the Bible says about obedience. - Good idea. We'll talk about it when I get home. - Very well dear. I'll see you tomorrow. - [Arthur] Okay honey. - Goodbye. - [Arthur] Goodnight. (phone rings) - Hello? - [Jane] Is this Pastor Owen? - Yes, this is Jim Owen. - This is Mrs. Simms. I'm calling to see if I could possibly have a conference with you within the next few days. - Conference, of course I'd be glad to talk to ya. Let me check my calendar. How 'bout tomorrow at 1:30? - [Jane] Tomorrow at 1:30, that'll be fine. - Good, I'll see ya then. - [Jane] Thank you Pastor Owen. - Anytime. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Let him take up his cross daily and let him follow me. Jesus calls us not only to a life of trust and a life of belief in him, but to a life of commitment. Commitment in our personal lives, our dating relationships, and also our music. In every area of life. Let us stand for a song of invitation. - I'm getting tired of hearing every evangelist we get in here coming in and telling me how sinful I am. Last year it was get your hair cut. Now all we ever hear is turn off the trashy music. You'd think they'd get some other sermon to preach. - It if weren't for the party afterwards I wouldn't even be here. I sure hope this thing doesn't last much longer. I'm about to starve. ♫ Mold me and make me - [Jeff's Voiceover] What's wrong with me? I can't tell them, they'd only laugh. Lord, Jesus I'm sorry about yelling at Mom. I'll fix it up with her when I get home, but why do I feel like this? - Tag! - [Jim] Hey Jeff, how's it going? - Oh everything's fine Brother Jim. Service was just great. - Jeff, you gotta hear this. - I believe we're gonna need some more ice. - You're home early. How was the youth meeting tonight? - Oh, it was pretty good. Two kids got saved. The fellowship afterwards was okay. - Good. - Mom? - Yes? - Mom, I'm really sorry about the way I acted this afternoon. I shouldn't have said what I did. - That's alright dear. Don't worry about it. You go on and get some sleep now. Goodnight. - Thanks Mom. Goodnight. - Goodnight. ♫ Devil you're young, late in your life ♫ Devil you keep up ♫ Baby you've life ♫ Devil you keep up ♫ Baby you've life ♫ Devil you keep up ♫ Baby you've life ♫ Devil - [Jim] Now, how can I help? - I'll come straight to the point. I've come about Jeff. My husband and I feel we can no longer handle him. Jeff's not a bad boy, but he won't listen to me. And with Arthur out of town so much, well I just can't control him. - Can you give me a few specifics? - Basically it's Jeff's attitude. He won't obey me and then he blows up in anger and walks out. I've talked and talked to him about his music especially. But it just goes in one ear and out the other. His father has talked to him about that rock music, but it doesn't seem to phase Jeff. He either listens to that noise at Marty's or in the car. Brother Owen, Jeff respects you and you seem to have a lot of influence with him. Would you be willing to talk to him? - So then the problem is mainly Jeff's attitude, his rebellion concerning his music? - Jeff's attitude change became apparent right after we gave him a stereo for Christmas last year. I suppose that was the beginning of it. - [Jim] Do you know if Jeff listened to rock music before he had his own stereo? - I really don't know. I didn't pay that much attention to what he listened to. Does it make that much difference? - [Jim] Jeff has probably been a fan of rock for a long time. Kids hear it everywhere, at school, in the car, in restaurants, on TV. You weren't aware of his listening to it until Jeff started playing it on his stereo at home. When you and your husband began saying "No, no, turn it off." Well, that's when Jeff rebelled. - You make it sound like it's all my fault. What am I supposed to do? - Of course it's not all your fault. But neither is it all Jeff's fault. The more you attack his music, the more he rebels. Mrs. Simms, kids identify so closely with their music, that if someone attacks that music, it's a personal attack on the kids themselves. You criticize Jeff's music, he feels as though you're criticizing him. Especially if you know nothing about the music. He feels as though your discipline is merely as a result of differing opinions or taste in music. Tell me, do you know anything about Jeff's music, his favorite songs or lyrics to them? - [Jane] I'm afraid I must plead ignorance. The only thing I know about Jeff's music is that it's loud and it drives me up the wall. - (laughs) Well, you're not alone. Most parents are not knowledgeable concerning rock music, but in order to set standards in the home, parents should become informed. And being a consistent example will go much further than nagging or yelling. Do you watch soap operas on television? - Yes, but what does that-- - Mrs. Simms, Jeff could scripturally come up with the same arguments for why soap operas are bad, as you could for why rock music is bad. Whether or not you realize it, he watches you very closely. Being a consistent example for your children will quickly get the point across that you mean business. Scripturally a family's a two-sided responsibility. Children are to obey. Parents are not to provoke their children to rath. - I see what you mean. Now what can I do to correct the problem? - Discipline in love, not anger. Be consistent, be an example, and be available when Jeff does come to you and your husband with questions. And if you think it'll ease the tension, I'd be happy to talk with Jeff. - My husband and I would greatly appreciate it. I'm afraid to mention the subject to Jeff again for fear of another explosion. - Rock music is one of the most difficult things that a Christian young person must deal with. I'm not gonna lecture Jeff. That would turn him off immediately. But I can enlighten him on a few facts and guide him into his own personal decision concerning rock. I'll try to find out what's bothering him. - Thank you very much. I came here today because of Jeff, but I think I learned the most. - Well, my door's always open to you. Call me anytime. - [Jane] Thank you, goodbye. - [Jim] Bye bye. Thanks for helping me clean up the rec hall. - [Jeff] Oh sure. Anytime. - [Jim] Jeff, can I talk to you for a few minutes? - [Jeff] Well yeah, what's up? - Well, your mom came in to see me this afternoon. She says you've been having some problems. - (laughs) Yeah. Mom and I, I guess we haven't been getting along very well lately. - Hey, I'm not gonna deliver some big lecture or stick the Bible in your nose. If you wanna talk I'm here. - Brother Owen, I've been so confused lately. Mom's always yelling about something, but I guess I've been a real pain lately too. The Lord's really been convicting me about acting up at home, but whenever I decide to get things straightened out, then Mom starts in again about my music and I lose my temper all over again. I want to obey God and Mom, but (sighs) it's so hard. - Well, you know you're in good company Jeff. Even the apostle Paul had to write in Romans seven, verses 18 and 19, "For I know that in me, "that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. "For to will is present with me, "but to perform that which is good, I find not. "For the good that I would, I do not. "But the evil which I would not, that I do." - What can I do then? Part of me wants to obey God, but I always seem to get so sidetracked. - If I remember correctly we had a similar conversation about a year ago. Do you remember? - Oh yeah. That's when I came in to talk about my salvation. - Right. When you believed with all your heart that Jesus died and rose again for your sins, you became a child of God. Salvation isn't a promise of a problem free life. But with the Holy Spirit inside you for guidance, by faith you can live for Christ. Hour by hour, minute by minute. A daily dedication and surrender. Colossians 2:6-7 states "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus our Lord, "so walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him "and established in the faith." But dedication and surrender, well they involve more than just going to church or reading your Bible. They also have to do with every area of your life. The Bible says "Whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God." Tell me, would that include your music? - My music? Well, sure, but how can you-- - How can you set standards? Well any standards for a Christian should be set according to scripture. Sometimes that can be difficult because scripture isn't always specific. It never specifically says thou shall not smoke. And yet we know that it does talk about taking care of your body because the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. If whatever you do is to glorify Christ, shouldn't your music glorify him as well? - Sure, but, does that mean the only thing I can listen to is Amazing Grace or How Great Thou Art? - No, of course not. But the music and the words to songs should not be against principles set down in scripture. Elicit sex, drugs, mocking God, the occult, aren't these things often found in rock music? - I haven't thought of it like that. But not all rock is that way. - No, no some contemporary music wouldn't fit into any of those categories. But well they are mainly the exception. A Christian must be very selective to make sure that his music wouldn't be, well an embarrassment to God. Would you be willing to participate in an experiment? - What do you mean, an experiment? - Well let's call it a contract. For two weeks I want you to not listen to any rock music. During those two weeks you can do some personal research to see if rock has a place in your Christian lifestyle. Are you willing? - No music for two weeks? - Hold on, I didn't say no music period. I said no rock music. Jeff, God gave music to edify. I don't want you to be totally without music in your life. That would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. These are some albums and a couple of tapes from my own personal collection. Why don't you borrow 'em for a couple of weeks. - Brother Jim, I don't know what to say. - Say you'll do it, you'll research rock music and find your own conclusions. Based on God's word, not an opinion. - Well I don't understand. What do you mean? - Well, everyone's got an opinion. Opinions change all the time. But God's word never changes. After the two weeks are up, come back and tell me what you decided. And remember what I said about dedication and surrender. They both apply to your choice in music. Well, how 'bout it. - Man, you really know how to put somebody on a spot. I guess it does sound like a pretty fair deal. (sighs) Well, alright. No rock music for two weeks. But, but what about the research? I mean, where do I start? - Ah, these are some recently published books on rock music from a Christian perspective. They contain some in depth information on various rock groups and their music. Why don't you take 'em and after you've read 'em come on back, tell me what you think. But remember, not just your opinion. - This is gonna be my decision? - Right, that's why I don't want just your opinion. I want a clearcut, scripturally based conviction. After you've done your research and prayerfully searched the scriptures, I want God's word to back up whatever you decide. Nothing vague or contradictory. If you decide to give me 10 reasons why you should listen to rock music, then I want 10 straightforward scriptures to back up that reasoning. - I didn't realize what I'd be in for. (sighs) Okay, okay. But what if I decide to go back to my old music after two weeks? - Fine. It's your decision. It's just like salvation Jeff. I can show you the facts of the gospel right outta this book, but I can't force you or anyone else to be saved. Surrender and dedication, it's an individual choice. - I suppose two weeks won't kill me. Sure, it's a deal. - Good. Listen, feel free to call me if you have any questions. Uh, let's pray before you go. Dear gracious God, I thank you for Jeff and for the decisions... (rock music) (gentle music) - (sighs) Two weeks! (scoffs) If I live that long. (doorbell rings) - [Jane] Hello Melissa, come on in. - Hi Mrs. Simms. - Jeff's in front of the TV as usual. - Look what Grandma Carter sent me for my birthday. Isn't it beautiful? I've always wanted a birthstone ring. - It's lovely. How is your grandmother? - She's says in her letter she's doing fine, but she won't be coming for a visit until Christmas. - Oh that's too bad. Why don't you see if you can get him out from in front of the TV? (mysterious music) - Jeff, look at my engagement ring. Jeff! My engagement ring. - Your what? That's not an engagement ring. - Silly, it's my birthday present Grandma sent me. Isn't it gorgeous? - It's pretty. I like the color. - Men. You wouldn't know pretty if it slapped you in the face. What are you reading? - It's a book about music. Here, you wanna have a seat? I'm doing some research. You're beautiful. - I know. (guns fire on the TV) Oh no. Jeff look, he's gonna shoot her! Oh. (laughs) - Great. What do you do for an encore? - I'm sorry. Here, let me help you. - What does the Bible say about an eye for an eye. - The Bible says nothing about bowl for bowl. - Forgiveness is one of my better virtues. - Jeff, did ya get the tickets to the rock concert? Jeff did you get the-- - No. I didn't get 'em. - Oh Jeff, you know the concert is in five days. They'll only hold reserve seats for so long. I can get my mom to pick 'em up if you don't think-- - No. Don't. I've changed my mind about going. - Changed your mind? Last week you were so excited about it. Has your mom said anything that have made you change your mind? - Yes, no. I mean it's my own decision. Look, I'd like to go, but I can't. - But we've waited almost three months for these tickets. I thought this concert was going to be my birthday present. - Well look, you can still go. - By myself? Alone? I won't go without you, you know that. - Well I can't go. We can go out to eat or something for your birthday. - I do not understand you. What in the world is going on? So, what's this got to do with you not going to the concert? - Okay, let me explain. You know how Mom and Dad have been on my back the past few months. She went to Brother Owen about it. - Don't tell me you're grounded. - Not exactly. - Well what? - Well I kinda made an agreement with Brother Jim. I'm not to listen to any rock music for two weeks. - Huh? - Well he loaned me some books to read about it. He even loaned me some of his Christian albums and tapes to listen to while I make my decision. - What kind of decision? - Well the Bible does say that everything we do should glorify Christ. So Jim wants me to research rock music. That's what the book's for. And to search the Bible and find out if Christians should listen to rock. Look, it's only for two weeks. And then I can give him my decision. - Oh all the stupid things. Look, we can still go to the concert. We'd already made our plans way before you made this deal. - I know. But I gave my word to Brother Jim. And to God. No rock music for two weeks. - But I, we've been counting on this. Look, just don't tell Brother Own we went. He'll never have to know anything about it. - But I would know. And God would know. And that matters a whole lot to me. Here, you should read some of this too. I never realized before how bad a lotta that music is. - I never thought you'd get so, so fanatical. - Melissa, please don't leave mad. I'd go if I could. Look, we can still go bowling or something. - Bowling? Well if you'd rather stay home and read some book instead of going out with me, well that's your decision. And I'm going to the concert. Maybe with Dennis. He'd love to go out with me. (sighs) - Alright, this is it. Look at him. (guys exclaim) - We'll get ya next time. - I hear ya. (laughs) - What's this I've been hearing about your not going to the concert? - I guess you've been talking to Melissa. Yeah, I'm not going. Did she tell you why? - Something about some kind of a deal with Jim. Man, what's going on? - Just been doing some reading up on rock music. Starting to believe what some of those preachers've been talking about. Hey, come over to my house later on. I'll show you what I'm talking about. - Oh man, don't start preaching to me. I get enough of that at church. - Okay, okay no preaching. But you're the one that always says I won't believe it unless I see it with my own two eyes. Come on Marty, it won't hurt just to see. (sighs) I don't want you to think I'm some kind of a fanatic, okay? - Fanatic? I've been wondering about that. Alright, come on, let's go. - Look at this one. You see what I mean? Over half of those songs, either the titles or the lyrics have something to do with sex. - So what? It's a popular subject now a days. And not just with rock music. - Well that's true. But does that make it right? Some of these groups, they believe in a lifestyle that's totally against everything the Bible teaches. Drinking, drugs, sex. Some are even involved in the occult. And if we buy their albums then we're putting money in their pockets. We're actually paying for their sin. Were promoting sin. - Okay, that's true for some groups. I could understand if every kid at church was buying that kinda stuff, but they're not. - I think you're wrong. While we're trying to reach people for Christ, the record industry is pumping sex and Satanism into the minds of little kids. I talked to two different record clerks at the shop at the mall, they said that they average age of a person buying a K.I.S.S. album was 12 years old. 12. I even saw a little kid buying Rolling Stones Start Me Up. - Jeff, don't ya think you're going off the deep end? I mean everyone has a right to his own tastes in music. - Yeah. Yeah but the Bible says to avoid even the appearance of evil. And a lotta this music is-- - Hey, I said no preaching. Look, I go to church because Dad makes me. He acts so holy. Plays deacon on Sunday and then cusses us out on Monday. If you wanna be a goody goody Christian, that's fine with me, but don't force it down my throat. - I'm not trying to force anything Marty. I just thought if I showed ya the facts that-- - Okay. Okay you showed me. Hey, if you're gonna get rid of these albums, throw 'em my way, huh? See ya later. - Hi. How ya doing? - Pretty good. Sherry dropped me off so I could see you. I just wanted to make sure you weren't still angry with me. I acted pretty stupid. I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. I never really was angry with you. You did have a good reason to be upset. I'm sorry about the concert. - Jeff, I didn't mean what I said about going with Dennis. I'd only go with you. Instead, do you still wanna go out to eat or something, like you said? - Sure. I gotta get back to work. I get off in 15 minutes. You wanna wait for me? We'll talk about it on the way, okay? - Okay, I'll wait. - Do you want something? - Sure, a Coke would be nice. Too bad about the concert. Marty's already got his tickets. He's really excited about it. Jeff, what if you went to Brother Owen and explained about our plans? I'm sure he'd understand about the concert. - Melissa, I thought we'd gotten that settled. - Okay. Okay, it's settled. (sighs) (easy listening music) Doctors office music. (rock music) - No, put it back on the other channel. You know I'm not supposed to listen to that. - You're not, I am. Jeff, don't. Come on. - No, cut it out. - (sighs) I think you're acting selfish. - I'm acting selfish? It's my car. - (sighs) Alright Jeff, just how long are you gonna keep this up? - I don't know. At first it was just to keep my parents off my back. It's been six days now and sometimes I wanna change that channel so bad. But I won't. I made a promise. - Well I'm glad you've only got eight days left. (upbeat music) - Hi, can I help you? - Yeah, my name is Jeff Simms. I's wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the music? - Yeah, let me get our manager. (music overpowers voice) - [Jim] So tell me Jeff, how's the research going? - [Jeff] After going through my own record collection, I went to the shopping mall as you suggested. - [Jim] Did you have any difficulty? - [Jeff] Some. I tried to interview two teenagers in the record department. But when they found out I was a Christian, they hassled me a little bit. But most of the people I talked to were pretty nice. One store clerk even recruited one of his friends in the store to answer my survey questionnaire. After that I copied down some of the song titles from the albums of the more popular groups of the past few years. - [Jim] Well, you have been busy. Have you come to any conclusions yet? - [Jeff] Well I haven't made any final decision, if that's what you mean. I'm still sorting things out, but I guess I am bothered about one thing. I never really realized before how dependent I've been on rock. Just walking by the audio store with the music playing, I just stopped there and listened without realizing what I was doing. The beat just grabbed me. I couldn't get the music outta my mind. Until I got home and played one of the tapes you gave me. It was just weird being controlled like that. ♫ Around him then you and (scats) (both exhale sharply) - Well Jeff, I'm really proud of you the way you stuck with our deal. Only five days left. I think I should tell ya something that may help you make your decision. - What's that? - Right after I was saved, when I was 16, I also researched rock music to see if it had a place in my Christian life. Only my decision was a little bit more difficult to make than yours because I was a rock 'n roll musician at the time. - You? But you're a preacher. - Yeah well now I'm a preacher, but when I was 16 I wanted to be a rock 'n roll musician. (laughs) I's a drummer in our older brother's band. We were pretty good for local talent. Then I got saved and things began to change. So, you see I do understand what you're going through. No matter how much my music meant to me, I had to know if it conflicted with my relationship with Jesus Christ. I think you know what I decided. - Yeah. But you were gonna be a preacher. I mean everybody expects a preacher to be holy and-- - And walk the straight and narrow? Jeff, I wasn't called to be a minister until my sophomore year in college. Just like you at 16, I didn't know where I was headed. But when Christ came into my heart, my values changed. Some sinful habits I had to get rid of instantly, but other things, things that had played a big part of my life, well I had to give them up. I remember right after I was saved my best friend decided he didn't wanna pal around with some religious holy Joe. Deciding to become a Christian even cost me a few friends. But, in the long run it was worth of it. - Well why didn't you tell me this from the beginning? - In the beginning wouldn't you have thought I was trying to push you into a corner? Force a decision on you you may later've regretted? No, you had to do your own research. Come to your own conclusions. Now with the work almost completed, you're facing some difficult choices. It's not as easy as a simple yes or no, is it? - Part of me wishes I'd never've even started. (sighs) Choices. It's not only rock music now, but my friendships with Marty's shaky because of all this. And Melissa's not exactly happy. She expects me to go back the way it was bere all this started. And Mom's been real nice so far, but what if I do decide to go back to my old music? If I make my decision one way, my friends are gonna hate me. And if I make my decision the other way, my parents (scoffs) are gonna kill me. - Well I think you may be exaggerating the point just a little bit. Besides, aren't you forgetting someone? - Who? - Jesus Christ. If you do what Christ wants, all the other things are gonna fall into place. He's not testing you beyond what you're able to handle. Stick with it these next few days. And remember, it's your decision. - Yeah. It's my decision. (sighs) Okay. Now sir, can I help you? - [Man] Two burgers and a Coke. - [Jeff] Two burgers and a Coke, is that it? - [Man] That'll do. - Hey Jeff, phone call. Some girl. Make it short, will you? - Yeah. This is Jeff. - Oh Jeff, wanna have some fun? We're invited to a party at Marty's tonight. He just called me. - Are you sure he wants me to come? We haven't been, well, you know. - He specifically told me to call you. He's called a bunch of the kids from the youth group and from school to come over for a party. Oh please go Jeff. It'll be loads of fun. Please? - What time? - [Melissa] Marty said around six. - Okay, I get off work about five o'clock. I'm gonna have to go home and shower and change though. I smell like a giant french fry. (both chuckle) Pick ya up about a quarter to six? Should I bring anything? - Just yourself. Marty says he's got all the munchies. See you about a quarter to six? - Okay, see ya. - Bye. Hey Leslie, how's it going? Good. Amanda, Morgan. - Hey you guys. - Hey Mel, hey Jeff. - Marty! - I have concocted the best onion dip you will ever taste. I oughta be a chef. Hey you remember the last pizza I made. - Yeah. You put bad anchovies on it and I was sick all night. - I told you to only eat the mushrooms. - I think I'll just stick to the cheese. I don't think you can mess that up. - Oh yeah, I'll bet. Um Jeff, why don't ya go back to the garage and get a bag of ice. - Sure. - How's he been acting to you? - Jeff seems a bit jumpy. But that ridiculous deal with Brother Owen'll be over in a couple of days. Then he'll snap out of it. - I don't know, he came on pretty strong with me last week. I think he's actually beginning to believe that stuff he's been told. I don't know, if he starts in on it again I'm just. - Do you want me to fill the cups? - Yeah, here. - I'll put these out. (rock music) - What's the idea? - With what? You mean the music. Oh man, this is a party. What do you want, Amazing Grace? - That's our youth group in there. - This ain't church. It's time to let down from some of the thou shalt nots we get all week. - Then why did you bother to invite me if you planned to play that garbage? - Man, it's like I told you before, don't push it down my throat. Now if you wanna have some fun, okay. But if you don't like it then just go home to mama. - Jeff, Jeff wait. I wanna talk to you. Jeff! You can't just walk out. I wanna talk to you now. - You heard him. He told me to leave, so I'm leaving. - Jeff. Jeff what is wrong with you? Marty is your best friend. And this is supposed to be a party. You were supposed to have fun. - Why did he bother to invite me anyway? Or'd you talk him into it? Look, I don't need you to fight my battles for me or get me invited to places that I'm not wanted. - Jeff, don't kick up a stink about that music now. You've only got two days left on that agreement. - Look, do you think it's gonna blow over in two days? Well it's not. Not in two days, not ever. - Not ever? Jeff, you've been letting those books you've been reading fill your head with-- - That's right, that's right. I've learned quite a bit these last two weeks and I'm not gonna stick around here and be a hypocrite. - Don't you start preaching at me Jeff Simms. You can save it for Sunday School. I don't blame these guys for laughing at you behind your back. You've become a fanatic, a real fanatic. Why don't you just go home? Go home before you lose any more friends. (door slams) - Jeff! Is that you Jeff? - Yeah, it's me. (rock music) - That boy! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff, I am trying to. Jeff. I am really disappointed in you young man. What about your agreement with Brother Owen? No, you can't even keep that. You've gotta blast the roof off with that garbage. Well we'll see what your father has to say about that when he gets home. And I'm sure Brother Owen-- - Get off my case! I'm sick of hearing it. Go ahead, tell Dad. Tell Brother Owen. I don't care. You think you're so perfect, well you're not. With your nose in the soap operas all day, they're nothing but sex with commercials. Then you scream about my music. You're a hypocrite, a hypocrite. - Jeff?? Jeff come back. (rock music) I'm sick and tired of telling you to turn that junk down. Now turn it off. - [Melissa's Voiceover] I never thought you'd get so, so fanatical. - [Jim's Voiceover] Shouldn't your music glorify him too? - [Marty's Voiceover] Oh man, it's a party. What do you want, Amazing Grace? - [Jeff's Voiceover] Over half of those songs either the titles or the lyrics have something to do with sex. Promoting sin. - [Jim's Voiceover] No matter how much I loved my music, I had to know if it conflicted with my relationship with Jesus Christ. - [Melissa's Voiceover] Go home before you lose any more friends. - [Jim's Voiceover] Things that had played a big part of my life, I had to give them up. - [Melissa's Voiceover] You've become a fanatic, a real fanatic. - [Jane's Voiceover] You've gotta blast the roof off with that garbage. - You're a hypocrite, a hypocrite. (gentle, thoughtful music) Lord. Lord, I'm trying so hard. It seems like everything has gone so wrong. I can't fight everybody. I do wanna glorify you in everything. And even in my music. (rock music) (doorbell rings) Could you get Melissa for me? - Sure. - Jeff, I'm so glad you came back. I knew once you thought it over you'd see things-- - Wait a minute, Melissa. I've got something I wanna tell you, both of you. - Mel, he's gonna start spouting off the same old stuff again. Well look pal, you can forget it, 'cause I'm not interested. - Melissa. I listened to you earlier. Please listen to me. I've been insulted and made fun of the last two weeks. Especially tonight by people that I'd thought were my friends. I just had a big blowup with Mom tonight. Said some things I shouldn't have. I've been driving around the past two hours trying to get my head together. - So? - So I've made a few decisions. First of all I'm tired of one day a week Christianity. I want people to think that I'm different when they see me. I want them to think that Christianity is something more than just going to church. If that labels me a fanatic, well alright. And another thing, I want the things that I say and the things that I do to glorify God. If that means not doing certain things or not listening to rock music, well that's alright too. I wanna be your friend. And Marty's. But if I've gotta make a choice between you and living the kind of life that God wants me to, then maybe I'd better find new friends. (sighs) - [Jim] Looks like the whole family's here tonight. - Hi, how are ya? - [Jim] Just fine, how are you? - Brother Owen. - Well Jeff, you nervous? - Kinda. I just hope it helps. Makes them think of things like I have the past two weeks. - Well I appreciate your willingness to share your research with the youth meeting tonight. It's just about time to start. We'd better be getting in. - Brother Owen before we go, my wife and I wanna thank you for the help you've given Jeff. For the help you've given all of us. After I flew in from Chicago, I had a few surprises waiting for me. But we got together as a family and we talked and we prayed and we got things straightened out. - And after Jeff shared some of his research with us, well, Arthur and I committed some things to Christ also. - Well that's great. It's good to see how the Lord's working in your lives. Well, I think we'd better introduce our speaker. I think he's got a few things on his mind too. Come on. - I guess most of you know me. I'm Jeff. I've been doing a special research project the past two weeks on rock music. Brother Owen suggested that I share with all of you what I found out. So here I am. (sighs) I want you to think about these questions I'm gonna ask. How many of you plan to leave church tonight to go out and get drunk? Or how many of you are gonna go out and shoot up with some heroine or smoke a joint? How many of you guys and girls are gonna leave the service tonight and (sighs) if you're shocked by these questions or if you think they're a little funny, maybe you should take a close look at the music you've been listening to. Personally, I like rock music. That is, my flesh. The carnal part of me really likes rock. Man I can just turn up that old stereo and the beat just drives away my bad mood. Pretty soon I'm really getting into it. Really moving with it. And all problems are gone. (sighs) But what about the spiritual part of me? Aren't we supposed to pray and give our burdens to Jesus Christ? Are we supposed to just turn up the volume on our stereos a little louder and forget about it all? I know sometimes when Mom and Dad, when they would try to talk to me, I'd just tune 'em out by turning up my music. Haven't you done the same thing? Pretty soon I couldn't hear anything at all, not even God. And I know some of you are thinking, hey I listen to rock music, but I can control it. I don't think that's right. What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? Or when you come home in the afternoon from school? What do you do when you get in your car? Or what's the last thing you heard before you came in the service this evening? Just walk into some record store that's playing a really good get down beat. See what the music does to you. Have any of you ever seen a rock concert on TV? Or maybe even been to one personally. How did the audience react to the music? Well, did they just sit quietly in their seats and listen? Man I sure wouldn't. No, they were all in mass, swaying and clapping and dancing and jumping to the beat. They were actually being controlled. And so were you. Also, do ya like to sing along with the radio? I did a survey out at the mall and four out of five of the teenagers I talked to said that they lyrics weren't important as long as the music was pretty good. I don't know about you guys, but whenever I hear a good beat, I just start singing right along, without even really caring or thinking about what I'm saying. But aren't we supposed to have the mind of Christ? What are the main themes of rock music? When I went through my own record collection I was shocked. Isn't sex a major theme? And the occult too? And what about the lifestyles of the popular groups and artists? Some are admitted homosexuals. Others brag about how many people they've had sex with. And how many rock stars have been arrested for drug possession? Some have even died from drug overdoses. I used to think, so what? 'Til I took a close look at what the Bible has to say about it. Galatians 5:19-21 says this: "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: "adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, "idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, "wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, "murders, drunkenness, revelings and such like. "Of the which I tell you before "as I have told you in times past, "that they which do such things "shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Most of these things are a part of rock music, aren't they? And we fill our minds up with these things that God hates. How can we ever expect to please God or to glorify Christ? Here's a song. Here's a song by The Eagles. Used to be one of my favorite songs. One Of These Nights. But listen to the lyrics. Full moon is calling, the fever is high, the wicked wind whispers and moans, you've got your demons, you've got desires, I've got a few of my own. And later on the words go on. I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself. I've been searching for an angel in white. I've been looking for a woman who's a little of both. I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight. Is that Godly? And listen to these titles. Listen to how many of 'em have something to do with Satanism or the occult. Sympathy For the Devil, Dancing With Mister Dee by The Rolling Stones, Devil's Den and Dance With the Dragon by Jefferson Starship, Evils Ways and Soul Sacrifice by Santana. And listen to these by the rock group AC/DC. Rock 'n Roll Damnation, Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell and this is my favorite right here, Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be. What about those of you who are buying K.I.S.S. albums? 12 years old and younger. Three of their albums are entitled Hotter Than Hell, Dressed to Kill and Destroyer. And I've seen little kids wearing K.I.S.S. t-shirts. Captain & Tennille have even tried to change their images with songs like You Need a Woman Tonight, You've Never Done It Like That. Don't forget Rod Stewart. Do You Think I'm Sexy, Passion, Tonight's the Night. And you might be sitting there thinking hey man, I don't listen to that stuff. I mean I don't buy K.I.S.S. That's great. But I think you'd better look at your albums. If three or four, or if only one song promotes sin, then that's what the author is promoting. And if we buy those albums, every album we buy encourages that artist to keep putting out that kind of music. Even Barry Manilow wrote in one of his hits, Could It Be Magic, come into my arms and let me know the wonder of all of you. And he's supposed to be mild. I go to school with most of you. The other kids at school know that I'm a Christian. But if they don't see me acting any different than they act, then what are they gonna think? And if my music is no different than theirs, then they're gonna say Christianity's no big deal. He's no different than anybody else. I can take it. I can take it or leave it. Each one of us is an advertisement for Jesus Christ. The friends we go to school with and the ones in our neighborhood, will they accept the message that our lives are advertising? Christians should be different. Different in what we say, different in where we go, different in how we dress, different in what we do, different in what, in what we don't do. And shouldn't our music be different also? How can we think or concentrate on pure and good thoughts when the driving beat is pumping our minds full of sinful thoughts and our bodies full of sinful movements. Jesus Christ said "He that is not for me is against me." Everything that we do should be to glorify Jesus Christ. I want my life and the things I do to be for my Christ. Not against my Christ. I've made my decision, what's yours? ♫ I'll praise your name Lord ♫ Until I'm home ♫ I'll praise your name Lord ♫ I'll praise your name Lord ♫ I'll praise your name Lord ♫ And sing your song
