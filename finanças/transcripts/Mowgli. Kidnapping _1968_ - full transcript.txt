Snesarev Director of Production: A. Zorina The first chapter told the story of how a little boy named Mowgli, who barely avoided falling prey to the tiger Shere Khan, was adopted into a pack of wolves. Happy hunting! Happy hunting! Like this. Like this. Here is a running deer. Run by its side! Assault! Strike! Lousy job. Once more. Why are you running on two legs when you have four? Calm down, Iron-Paw. I run better that way! Of course he does. He is a man, after all. I am a wolf! I am a wolf of the Free Tribe! Silly cub. You should learn to jump and climb better. It's not that easy, Mowgli. Nicely done. Nicely done. Well done, Mowgli. Well done. Behave yourself, Mowgli. I wasn't trying to skin him or anything! Insolent cub! Calm down, lron-Paw. He is a man after all. Ha ha! They wanted to capture Shere Khan, but they captured Hathi instead. The wise Hathi. O Hathi, I will help you. But what can you do, Little Frog? - Little Man. - Mowgli. I can do this. Disgrace! Disgrace! Mowgli is running along the tree vines! Disgrace! Like the Bandar-log! Disgrace! Disgrace! Thank you, Mowgli. He will teach us to do that too. Yes, Mowgli, you are a man. Of course he is a man. Only remember, Mowgli, Shere Khan knows that too. Goodbye, Mowgli. Goodbye. Happy hunting. We don't hunt, silly. Good hunting to you. He can do everything. He knows everything. He is like us, but without a tail. He is like us, but naked. I say, only a man can be so careless. You don't know the local inhabitants. What should you do? We should growl. We should flee. What should you say? I... We... - You... - They... We are of one blood, you and I. He can do everything. He knows everything. He is like us, but without a tail. He is like us, but naked. Hurry! Hurry! Put dead bats on my stupid head! - Oh, why didn't I warn him? - Hurry! I am a foolish root-digger! Roll me into the hives of wild bees! Give me to Kaa the Python! Oh! Let's go to him! Oh... yes! The mere whisper of his name makes the wicked Bandar-log tails shake! Be careful, Bagheera. Good hunting, Kaa. Good hunting to us all. One of us at least needs food. I am as empty as a hollow well. What a coincidence. We are in the middle of a hunt. Come with us, Kaa, if you wish, of course. We have a leader now. All Jungle dwellers will admire us now. - We are the cleverest in the Jungle. - A great tribe! We deserve admiration. We all say so, and so it must be true. All Jungle dwellers admire us. It's true. It's true. We are a great tribe. He is the smartest of all my pupils. And besides, we love him, Kaa. I also have known what love is. Now I will tell you a story... You'd better tell your story later, Kaa. The Bandar-log called you an earthworm! Where are they? We thought you knew. Up! Look up, Baloo! I have seen the boy. He asked me to tell you that he is in the Cold Caves. Thank you, Chil the Kite! I won't forget you! No need to thank me. He said the Master Word. He hasn't forgotten. He hasn't forgotten! Onward! So they called me a yellow fish? Yes, yes, a fish. And also a worm, an earthworm. They called me a frog? Yes, yes, a frog. And also an earthworm. Good hunting. Good hunting. Bagheera, I am coming! Bagheera, I am already climbing... They almost tore me to pieces-- into a hundred little bear cubs. So this is Mowgli? You look like a Bandar-log. I am a wolf. I am one of the Free Tribe. My kill shall be your kill. A brave heart and a courteous tongue. Bandar-log, can you see? We see, O Kaa. Sit still... and watch. Come one step closer. Closer. Let's go. What will happen here is not for your eyes. Closer. A little longer, and I would have walked down his throat. I will never again ask for Kaa's help. This is the second of the Mowgli stories.
