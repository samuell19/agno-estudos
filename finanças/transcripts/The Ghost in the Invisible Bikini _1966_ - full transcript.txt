Thirty-two, Hiram, baby. Hiram, baby? [chuckling] Well, you look lovely, just the same. Hiram, let me clue you in. You have a terrible problem. Good heavens, my dear girl. What problem could I possibly have? I'm very wealthy, I'm very healthy. And very dead. I beg your pardon? No need to-- You're dead, just like me. Oh? Oh. You know, I don't like this. I don't like this one, tiny, little bit. No one does, Hiram, baby. That's why I'm here, to help you get up there. Is there a chance for me? Uh-huh. What do I have to do? Well, now, why don't you just get out of your nice, little coffin and I'll give you the scam. You have 24 hours in which to mastermind one good deed... if you want to spend eternity with me. Good deed-- Good heavens. I'm a little outta practice. I wouldn't know where to begin. Well, I can't coach you. It has to be your idea, pussycat. Oh, and another thing, you can't leave the crypt. I can't le-- Then, how can I do a good deed? Well, anything you want done, I'll do. Ah. Oh, and if you're successful, there's a bonus in it for you. A bonus? Tell me, what is it? Well, uh, you notice there's a discrepancy in our ages. Well, since you mention it, if you look closely, um, well, yes. Well, you see, that's because I stopped aging when I was in the accident. And you, my poor friend, kept getting older and older. Never mind that-- Tell me about the bonus. Well, the bonus is, if you succeed in doing one good deed, they promised you'd be young again. Young again? Oh, Cecily, my dear, then once more, you and I could trip together, hand in hand, through the sweet-smelling fields of new mown clover, to enjoy the moonlight of a warm summer's night-- Ugh, let's not get sickening, chicky baby. Time's a-wastin'. You've got to pull off a good deed, remember? Yes, I know-- I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Wait a minute. How long have I been, uh, dead? Hmm, you're hardly cold. One week. One week. Then tomorrow, the reading of my will takes place, and if I know Reggie Ripper, my attorney, he'll try to keep all the money for himself. Now, what you have to do is to see that my rightful heirs get the money. That will be my good deed. Are you sure they'll make me young again... up there? They never go back on their promise. Good. Now the first thing for you to do is to try to get into my house. But, how will we keep in touch with each other? We should have a walkie-talkie. I have something better. Do you remember the old crystal ball shtick? Oh, it never worked. Try it now. Not bad. Ah, the first of my heirs, Chuck Phillips. Not very bright, but a nice boy. Heir number two, Lili Morton. Not very bright, either, but a beautiful figure. So I've been told. And heir number three, Myrtle Forbush. Now, what can I say about her, in front of you? Ah, Reggie Ripper, my wicked attorney, and his vile sidekick, J. Sinister Hulk. Really, my dear chap, when you threw in with me, I told you there might be some risks involved. I know, I know, and I'm game, but listen... Is this joint really haunted, like they say? Certainly not-- Don't be ridiculous. Now, look here, Hulk. There's a million dollars involved in this estate, plus the house, and your job is to, uh, take care of the other heirs. Follow me? I'm way ahead of ya. The job will be done very neat and tidy, or my name ain't J. Sinister Hulk. [chuckling] My associates are on the way now. Well, I hope they get here soon. My guests are due any minute. They will, they will. This is the greatest bunch of cut-throats I ever had the pleasure of working with. Excellent-- Once they eliminate the other heirs, the fortune will be all mine! Uh, ours. Mine.Ours. Mine, old bean. [shouting] What? Yours, old bean. That, my dear Cecily, is the enemy. For my good deed, you're to harass them and help the young people. Got ya, Hiram.
