Madam? Madam! Émilie, my love, death struck you too soon, in the criminal hands of an irresponsible man. A coward who took the life... of a wonderful woman. A loving... and generous mother. MISSING CHILD Paolo, we went through so many hard moments together. When we lost our parents, it was you who... I held up thanks to you, for you, with you. And now you're leaving. I keep telling myself that... you're meeting mom and dad. They will take care of you. My darling, I know you would've forgiven. You were a sweet, caring soul. But not me. I hate that person with a passion. I accepted you just as you were - so fragile and unhappy. I miss you. I love you, little brother. Even if you decided to die. I love you, honey. I love you with all my heart. THREE YEARS LATER Happy birthday, buddy. Give daddy a kiss. You look handsome! - That cake is beautiful. - Thanks. - Are you happy? - Yes. - OK! - Go play with your cousin. - Cheers! - Cheers to you. In my day, a man wouldn't have moved on this fast. It's hard for a man to raise a child alone. I'm his mother. We would've helped him. I'm glad he picked himself up. They look happy together. There's something off about that Luisa. And she's unemployed. Look. - Everything OK? - Yes. - It must be hard for you. - Why do you say that? A lot of women would've rather kept us away, wipe us out of Mathieu's past. The dead can take a lot of space. But you did the opposite. You kept involving us in your life. This may sound weird, but Émilie would've loved you. Happy birthday to you! Yes! Bravo! Uncle Jérémy! Hello, buddy. How are you doing? - How old are you now? 25? - No, not yet. - Are you sure? - Yes. You're all grown up. Here. - Careful! It's fragile. - OK. - Hello. - Did you have a nice trip? - Arthur? This is for you. - Thank you. Come on, open it. What is it? Binoculars? For the birdwatching hut? Yes, and on your first day, we'll watch the chickadees flight. - Happy? - Yes. You know what? You and I are going to plant it in the garden. It's your twin tree. You're the same age. It'll grow up with you. - Do you like that? - Yes. That deserves a kiss, doesn't it? Thank you, mommy! You're welcome, sweetie. Turn around. Is it here? Are you upset he called me "mommy"? - Are you kidding? - I'd understand. I was really happy. - It was a nice birthday party. - Yes. Too bad Jérémy left before the end. Why wouldn't he let you examine him? A migraine is not... For Jérémy, a migraine equals a bad hangover. Didn't you notice? He's an alcoholic. No. I thought he was just uncomfortable. You know the best part? He asked me if he could take Arthur for a week. Like I'm gonna give him my son. You can't trust junkies and drunks. - Does it hurt? - Yeah. You're all tense! I'm exhausted, mostly. What's crazy about the body is that unlike people, it never lies. I feel like you're hiding something from me. What's that terrible secret of yours? My secret? My brother killed your wife. He hit her because he was speeding and because he was a junkie. You know, the kind of people you can't trust. He killed himself the night after. My terrible secret... Do you want to know what it is? I really want to sleep. No! It's not fair. MONDAY I'm sorry, little man. I can't stay. But to make up for it, look what I have. - Thanks. - It's for you. - Do you like it? - It's OK. Mom will come. Yeah. OK, bye now. Good luck! - Alright? - Yeah. Sorry I'm not staying. A patient had a stroke. But his mama will be there. "Often, to amuse themselves, the crewmen take the albatross, "vast birds of the seas, who follow, sluggish companions of the voyage, "the ship gliding on the bitter gulfs. "Hardly have they placed them on the boards, "that these kings of the azure, clumsy and shameful, "let piteously their great wings in white, "like oars, drag at their sides. "The poet resembles the prince of the clouds, "friendly to the tempest, mocking the bowman. "Banished to ground in the midst of hootings, "his giant wings hinder him from walking". Bravo! Excuse me? Sorry. Do you know where Arthur is? He was here a second ago, with Amélie. I have to go. I would've liked to congratulate him. I'll pass on your message. I really hate not saying goodbye to him. He's probably forgotten about you. I keep applying to jobs, no one's called me. Keep trying. Persistence is the key. Really? You've been saying that for two years. I've responded to 87 offers. I had two interviews. There are no more jobs in your field. People take pictures themselves. You must evolve with the law of the market. There are webmaster courses... I have to take this, it's my son's school. Hello? Yes. Excuse me? No, he's not. OK, I'll be right there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... What do you mean, he's gone? How can it be? We've searched the building. Nothing. He just vanished. We haven't seen him since you left. His father's not answering the phone. He switches it off when he's with a patient. Maybe Arthur's with him. That makes no sense! Why would he leave school? How would he have found his father? No! I'll call him anyway. He'll end up answering. Hello, you have reached Mathieu... Mathieu, it's me. Call me as soon as you hear this. It's urgent. Very urgent. No, no... - Come with us, please. - Yes. Slimane. Hello. Captain Colbert. I have a few questions before issuing an alert. - Was Arthur kidnapped? - Try to calm down. We don't know yet. It's procedure. Of course. Go ahead. When was the last time you saw him? The kids did a show at school today, at 8:30 am. Did it go well? Anything unusual? He was stressed out. He had to recite a poem and was afraid of going blank. No arguments? No. He doesn't get into fights. I don't mean his friends. I mean you. Did you scold him? Is there any reason he'd want to run away? You think he ran away from me? I don't know. I'm exploring every lead. It'd be the best case scenario. No. There were no arguments. In fact, he had called me "mommy" for the first time. - Who are you, then? - His stepmother. We're not married, but it's just as if. So, legally, you're nothing at all. Here it is. Tell me about him. He's a very sweet boy. He... He hates conflict. He loves the sea and nature in general... He wants to be a pirate. You have to find him. He can't sleep without his blankie. Can you give us a second? I hope you're more efficient this time. We'll do a search this afternoon. - I'm coming. - Me too. In that case, let me warn you. The media pressure will be fierce. You'll have to deal with it. But it's for the best. The chances of finding your child will be greater. Do you have a photo? Yes. I'll get you one. What happened? - Are you rich, Mr. Ricoeur? - Why? I'm a family doctor, my partner is unemployed... No one would ask us for a ransom. Can I ask you a more personal question? Does Arthur like his stepmother? Absolutely. Do you know what happens when you're away? What are you trying to say? Some perfect mothers beat up their kids when dad's at work. Charming husbands hit their wives. Teenagers abuse their parents... I've learned to be wary of appearances. Here. The most recent ones. Mister Ricoeur! Mr. Ricoeur, over here, please. If anyone knows anything about Arthur, please contact us. He's a brown-haired boy... With blue glasses and a green jacket. Mrs. Ricoeur, just a word for the local paper. Arthur is an adorable boy. If you can hear us, whoever you are, bring him back to us. Just look at her. She's got her moment of glory. She thinks she's his mother. I'm not his birth mother, but I love him! Is that so hard to understand? Let's get going. Don't worry, Luisa. It's OK to crack. We're all on edge. We all know that you love him. Thank you. That's enough, Mom. Arthur! Arthur! Do you remember the Mercier case? The boy was kidnapped for years. He was held by his own father in a 6 sqm room. The boy was locked in a basement. He was dead when we found him. The parents were in every show. And in the end, it was them. His body was gone. Only his teddy bear was found. God knows where they buried him. Arthur! So you're saying Arthur left with a man in a cap? That's right. I was watching the yard, and I saw a guy walking away with a kid. There were parents everywhere this morning, so I thought he was walking his dad. Did you recognize the father? Mr. Ricoeur. Not really. I've only been a monitor for 2 weeks. OK... So you don't know the parents. And the children? Are you sure it was Arthur? I recognized him. I don't know the parents, but I do know the kids. But you saw them from behind. That was enough. How would you describe Arthur? A small fellow, about this tall. Brown hair. Blue pants and a jacket. That could be pretty much any first grader. I guess, but... It was him. I'm sure. Ah, Captain. How's the investigation going? We've issued an Amber alert, set up a phone line to gather information, and put roadblocks in strategic areas: stations, airports, bus lines, tollbooths... It's been 10 hours, and still nothing. Any suspects? The boy's stepmom. I know she's hiding something. But I'll find out. Well... You better hurry up, Captain. You're not sleeping either. I don't think I can. I'll stay with you. TUESDAY No one's heard from little Arthur in the last 22 hours. Although the police remain quiet about the investigation, the tension's growing among his relatives. What's the plan? Going to the hospital. - Why don't you take a shower? - No. - How about coffee? - No. I'll go crazy if I stay here. Alright. I'll leave my phone on. - What're you doing here? - I want to help. I need to do something useful. I understand, but not today. Why not? I can handle anything, except pacing back and forth. Please. I've spent hours waiting for the phone to ring. I can hear Arthur everywhere. It's a nightmare... I beg you. OK, you can come. But you might not like it. Where are we going? To the pond. It's not Arthur's. It's not Arthur's. Do you know all his clothes? Stepmoms don't always pay attention to details. I'm a mother. On Monday, Arthur was wearing blue pants, The pocket's slightly undone. I had to sew it up. He was also wearing a blue shirt. All students did. And he had a blue hoodie as well as a green down jacket that ran small on him. And grey sneakers, size 31. Ms. Castelli, over here, please! Ms. Castelli, just a quick comment. - Luisa... - Fatou? Why aren't you coming to the projects anymore? You grew up in the projects. Why didn't you tell me? I have a few questions, Mr. Ricoeur. See you later. Want some coffee? Of all the guys in the world, why him? Did you tell him? Did you tell him your brother killed his wife? Two years ago, Émilie's hospital organized a ceremony in her memory. I was there. I wanted to tell the truth. My dear friends, it is with sadness that we gather today to remember Émilie Ricoeur. I think of the sorrow of her close relatives, her loyal friends, and that of her husband, Mathieu, and her son, Arthur. Émilie was brave and had a big heart. Some doctors give up their humanity to preserve themselves. But not Émilie. She never forgot... I never said anything. It was love at first sight. Six months later, I became Arthur's stepmother... And I could never mention Paolo. I just couldn't. I'm too scared to lose him. - What did you tell him? - Not much. The basics. I'm an orphan since my parents died, and my brother committed suicide. And later on? Why didn't you tell him? Mathieu's father was a compulsive liar. He led a double life. Now he just can't stand people lying. You don't have to understand. It's pathetic. But I love him. And I love Arthur. They're my only family now. I could't bear to lose them. People are asking about you. No one ever knew why you vanished. I'll go see you. Promised? - Yes, promised. - Call me, alright? Good luck. Your friend left? Let's go for a ride. You have things to tell me. Your friend told me about your brother's accident. She messed up. Can you explain? My brother killed Émilie. He's the driver who hit her and ran. He had a job interview. My brother was... He was a vulnerable boy. He had no childhood. I'm not making excuses for him.... I'm telling you who he was. When our parents died, I was 19 and he was 10. I couldn't keep him. He was sent to a foster home. I got him back when I got a job. He was 15. He was already completely lost. He used anything he could find - coke, heroin, ecstasy... He'd even sniff ether. But the day of the accident, he was on the right track. We were waiting for him. I was sure he was gonna get that job and sort his life out. When he came home, he told us he needed to get some sleep, and he'd go to the cops after. But he didn't. He killed himself that night. Overdose. Why didn't you tell me that? - I was... - He killed my wife! And you took her place! Who do you think you are? No... Wait... Maybe you kidnapped Arthur. - How do I know you're not lying? - I'm not! For crap's sake, how can I believe you now? Captain? This is Luisa Castelli. I know who killed Émilie Berger. Here it is. I haven't touched it. We'll take the car to have it analyzed. I could arrest you for concealment of evidence. What could I possibly do with that car? When Paolo hit Émilie and killed himself, I just wanted to escape this nightmare. So I closed that door and never said anything to anyone. Only Fatou knew. She was his best friend. But all the lies had been eating me up ever since. I kept wondering when they'd blow up in my face. They did today. And somehow, it's easier now. I don't know if Mathieu will forgive me, but at least, it's over. Is it true what they say? That the first 24 hours are key to find a child alive? That's statistics. But is it true? Yes, it's true. Hello? Hello? - Mommy? - Arthur? Arthur, it's you! Oh, baby, are you alright? Tell me where you are. We'll come to get you. Tell me... I spoke to Arthur. He's alive. He just called me. It was him. I heard his voice. Why you? It's been 32 hours. 32 hours and we have nothing. Not a lead, nothing. Do you realize how urgent this is? That kid could be with a pedophile, for all we know! - We'd like to speak to the Captain. - OK. Arthur called. My phone rang right after you left. It was him. - What did he say? - Nothing. Just "mommy". Give me your phone. We'll try to trace the call. - What's the code? - 24 24. We'll also check your version. Why didn't he say anything else? Why not call his father? Makes more sense. You can have the bed. - I'll sleep in the couch. - Take the bedroom. I'll stay here. I prefer. I won't be able to sleep, anyway. WEDNESDAY Alright! One, two... Go, Arthur! Come here! Wait for me! There you go. Look at the camera. Look at me. Careful with your glasses. My love... Are you ready? Here we go. One, two... three. OK, come. Arthur! I'll talk to Émilie's parents and brother. I wanted you to know. The Captain's keeping my phone, so you won't be able to reach me. Right. See you later. Honey... I found my brother in his bed... dead. He couldn't bear what he had done. Please, leave. Your brother killed Émilie, and you didn't say a word. Go away! Get out of my place! I'll walk you. Thank you for coming. You were brave. - Any news of Arthur? - No. - Then what are you doing here? - And you? I come to the Berger's on Wednesdays. Does that bother you? No. Tom! Don't worry. I'll bring him back. Tom. Come on. Stop! It's dangerous. You could hurt someone. You'll cause an accident, and scare Champion. Dogs are sensitive. How do you know? I, too, had a dog. One day, there was an awful storm. He didn't come out for a week. Come on, give me that. Give me your hand. Where on Earth were you? Huh? Tell me! Champion ran away. He was trying to catch him. You drive me crazy! At the Berger's, he takes the cake! He puts me through the mill. - He doesn't quite realize. - Sure he does! He's a real devil. Come on. Jérémy! Open the door! I know you're there. Open up! My parents warned me. I've nothing to say. But I do. Don't look at the mess. A party with friends. - Are you feeling better? - What do you mean? You left early. You didn't look well. Yes. I had a migraine. And you came straight here? Yeah. I took my car and I drove home. I slept 10 hours. Not a safe thing to do. I prefer to be at home. I found this outside. What is it? - A feather. - Yes. One of Arthur's blue feathers. I found it next to your car. Arthur must've been playing inside. He didn't take his mask out at the party. He took it to school the day he disappeared. You should leave now. - Arthur, are you here? - Are you kidding me? You dare accuse me, after what your brother did? Get out now. I said, get out! Hello. I'm Luisa Castelli. I booked a room for my brother-in-law, Jérémy Berger. He was here for a party. Yes, I remember. - Did you see him? - Yes, of course. - When did he get here? - Sunday. You said 7 pm, but fortunately, I'm foresighted. He arrived at 4 pm sharp. - When did he leave? - The morning after, with my husband. Monday, at around 8. Are you sure? Maybe you mistook him for someone else. No.... I never forget a face. A young man, brown hair, bad shave? The cop brought your phone. And? She confirmed you got a call at around 5 pm. A call from Arthur. I told you! Did she trace it? It was made with a prepaid card bought in Amiens. Amiens? Jérémy goes there for work. Yes, and? He was here on Monday, when Arthur disappeared. The lady from the B&B confirmed it. He lied. I went to see him, and I found a feather from Arthur's mask. Aren't you done lying? You're accusing Émilie's family. You seriously believe I kidnapped Arthur? THURSDAY - You scare me. Arthur? - No. It's about your brother's car. Something doesn't add up. I didn't touch it, I swear. Stop defending yourself before you get attacked. I'll end up thinking you're guilty. What I found out about the car is bad news for me. I'm totally lost. It might be good news for you, though. The blood found is indeed that of your partner's wife. There's no doubt, your brother hit her. But the impact's a problem. She was coming out of the porch, on the right side. Based on the body and the envelopes found, she was getting the mail at her parents'. The mailbox was also on the right. Take a look. The impact is on the left side of the car. You mean he didn't kill her? He did. He did. He killed her. So... So, something's off. I've something to tell you, too. I found a feather at Jérémy Berger's. Émilie's brother. Arthur had a feather mask the day he disappeared. Also, Jérémy lied. He claims he went to Dunkirk on Sunday, but he stayed in Lille until Monday. He could've kidnapped Arthur. Why would he do that? I don't know. Did anything happen the day of the party? No. I mean... I don't think so. Thank you. This is Colbert. Get a search warrant for Jérémy Berger. I want to know what he likes, what he eats, what coffee he drinks... What he did last night and what his activities are. Mathieu, let me in. I need to talk to you. Please, forgive me. I should've told you the truth. But I didn't know how. Every day, I wonder why you chose me. Every day I'm scared to lose you. If you leave me, I'll understand. But the only thing that matters now is for Arthur to come back. Mommy. Want some coffee? Sure. See? I came. Tell me, do you still have my brother's... suicide note? I need to read it again. I'll go get it. Thank you. "She was running, "running like a maniac on the road. "When she saw me, she rushed up to my car. "She looked at me. "A pleading gaze, as if she was asking for help. "She threw herself under the car. "I can't bear "to see her begging eyes in my nightmares. "So this is the end. "I've never been good at living, anyway". Why do you want to read this now? The police analyzed Paolo's car. Something's not right. I don't know. I know it sounds weird, but I feel like Emily's death is connected to Arthur's disappearance. Maybe Émilie was depressed and jumped in front of the car. Why would she do that? Ask Mathieu. Mathieu won't talk to me. He's too mad. Émilie's brother threatened me. Her parents kicked me out. There's gotta be someone you can talk to. My sister-in-law, maybe. She's the only one who didn't want to kill me. But it's not easy to talk to her. She's so... inflexible. - How's Tom doing? - Fine. Why? Last time I saw him, he was a bit nervous. He's upset about his cousin's disappearance. He refused to speak for a month after his aunt died. He's a very sensitive boy. But you're not here to ask me about my son. No, I'm not. I'd like to talk about Émilie. - Was she OK before she died? - How inappropriate. My brother wrote she threw herself under his car. A suicide note. He wouldn't lie. That is nonsense. Émilie had everything to be happy. An adorable boy, a fascinating job, a husband who adored her. She had no reason to die. Any other questions? Good. It's chaos here. We must absolutely find this little boy. OK, I love... So? Where're we at? The noose is tightening on Jérémy Berger. The uncle. I've sent two men to Amiens with a photo of him. And the motive would be... He has a history of mental illness. Depression, alcoholism... Mathieu? Jérémy? - Hello. - Are you his wife? Will he make it? Mr. Berger has a fractured skull. Initial findings suggest he stayed outside for a long time. He's got hypothermia. I'll have to report it to the police. He needs to rest. No visitors allowed. - I'm counting on you. - Very well. Thank you. Mathieu? Mathieu! You have reached Mathieu. Please, leave a message. Mathieu, it's me. I'm really worried. I understand if you don't want to talk, but at least send me a text to tell me where you are. Or just if you're alright... I love you. What happened? Answer me! Am I bothering? Jérémy was recognized by a shop clerk in Amiens. That's where he bought the card. He's the one who called you. You were right. He might have kidnapped Arthur. Is that what you think, too? So you decided to beat him up. Where were you this afternoon? In the cemetery, at Émilie's grave. With everything that's going on, I needed to meditate. What're you doing here? I came to see my sister. Luisa found a feather at your place. Can you explain? What are you hiding? Huh? What did you do to my son, you bastard? - I didn't do anything! - What did you do to my son? It wasn't me! It wasn't me, damn it! You, idiot! That makes no sense at all. Your partner found Jérémy in your garden. He was nearly dead. What can I say? When I opened my eyes, he was gone. A biker helped me get up. Will he confirm your version? If you find him. He was headed for Touquet. He was missing a finger on his right hand. We'll try to find him. In the meantime, you'll remain in custody for attempted murder. You better step it up and find my son. Where is my son? Why is he being questioned? Give her a break. He's in custody. He's accused of trying to kill Jeremy. Nonsense! Why would he want to kill his brother-in-law? - Ex brother-in-law. - Whatever. He may have kidnapped Arthur. - What did he do? - It's not confirmed yet. But Arthur called me from Amiens. Jérémy was recognized by a shop clerk there. - That bastard! - Mother! That's enough now. Come on. - Sorry, no dogs allowed. - It's OK. I'll stay with Tom. How about some fries? Please, Mom. Alright. I'd like to ask you something. It's an unusual question. But it's important, for Arthur. About Jérémy... Was he weird in any way towards Arthur? I'm sorry. I have to go pee. It's urgent. Sure. I'll wait here. Tom? Tom, open the door. I won't come out. What's going on? Please, tell me. Go away! You can come out, Tom. I won't bother you anymore. - Do you promise? - I promise. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm just like you. I'm scared. I'm scared to death. You think your brother-in-law did it? You should question him instead of harassing me. We would've loved to. But you messed him up. The doctors won't let us. Did he tell you anything? No, nothing. - And yet, you suspect him. - Yes! Yes, I was so upset that I wanted to kill him, but I didn't. Let's start over from scratch, when you left your ex brother-in-law for dead. I won't come out. Go away! He's upset about his cousin's disappearance. He refused to speak after his aunt died... You drive me crazy! And at the Berger's, he takes the cake. He drives me up the wall. FRIDAY May I? I'd like to speak to Tom. - He's sick. - I must talk to him! Tom? Arthur? Tom! What are you doing here? Well? Come on. Let's go to the park. You too, Champion. What do you think? He says yes. Everybody's worried about you. That's not true. No one's ever worried about me. - Well, I am. - You? You're worried about Arthur, not me. It's OK, I'm used to it. They're always worried about him. That's right. I'm worried about Arthur. I'm worried sick. But you're wrong. I'm concerned about you, too. Why? I know you're scared, but I don't know why. I'm not scared for me. I'm scared for Champion. Why? If I tell you, he will die. Is that why you left? You wanted to hide him? If you talk to me, I promise to keep Champion safe. - Do you swear? - Yes, I swear. If you know where Arthur is, tell me. I don't know where Arthur is. OK, then... Who threatened your dog? What scares you so much? It's because of Émilie. I was there when she died. Wait, what do you mean? That summer... he went on vacation with his grandparents. Who? Arthur? They suggested I come. Two's more fun. But you know, Arthur is little. And when he talked to his mom on the phone, he cried. He told her he was alone in front of the TV. Then auntie came. But where were you? I was there, in the birdwatching hut. What were you doing in the birdwatching hut? I can't tell you. If I do, he'll kill Champion. Is that what Aunt Emily found out? What you were doing in the hut. Dad! Stop! Stop it! Help me! Please, help! Madam! I'm sorry. Listen to me, if you say one word about what happened, you can kiss your dog goodbye. Understood? Don't tell anyone. Champion... I only have him. I can't say I won't. Sometimes, saying nothing can be worse. I promise I'll keep Mr. Berger away from you and Champion. OK, let's go. Grandma's gonna worry. Can you confirm that you assisted this man? Yes, absolutely. That's him, Captain. Was he injured? Someone's here for you. Later. It's your husband. Tell him I'm questioning a man. Too late. A child is missing. There's little chance of finding him. I can't live knowing he might be dying somewhere. LUISA CASTELLI I know what your father did to Tom. He did it to you, too. He'd molest you in the hut when you were a kid. I know you can't talk. Just do yes or no. When Philippe gave Arthur binoculars, you knew he was next. Am I right? So you hid him away. Please, help me understand where he is. This? Show me. Like this? This here? Thank you! We found the missing finger biker. Custody's over. Shit. 8 missing calls from Luisa. - You? - She called me once. - She wants to speak to Tom. - Why? Arthur! Arthur! Oh, my God! Sweetheart... Arthur? Where's Tom? Tom! What did you tell Luisa? That Mr. Berger had hurt us. Jérémy? No. The other one. The other Mr. Berger. Arthur? Come out, I know you're here. Did Uncle Jérémy tell you to hide, buddy? Jérémy's at hospital, you know? He can do nothing for you. Arthur... Oh, I get it. You want to play? You like playing with Grandpa? And you, Luisa? Do you like to play? I owe you big time. I wouldn't have found Arthur without you. Jérémy never told me about this place. So I followed you. And here you are. Get out. Where's your husband, Mrs. Berger? - Did you know he molested Tom? - You're crazy! - That's slander! - Where is he? He went to see Jérémy. What do you mean? His father's not there? Where's Luisa Castelli? OK, I'll take care of it. - How are we gonna find them? - The red dot's her. I put spyware on her phone. So, bad Uncle Jeremy kidnapped you, eh? You must've been scared, fellow. He kept him away from you. Away from me? Why? Because of what you did to him in the hut. You used to do it to Tom, too. It's not as if it was a crime. Jérémy and I had a beautiful relationship when he was a kid. Then, he grew up. We drifted apart. Adults can be disappointing. Only children are capable of love. Tom was OK with it, too. How can you say such a thing? Luisa! Drop the gun! I'm sorry. - Arthur... - He's alright. It's OK. Are you cold? - Mommy! - My love. And daddy? Subtitles: ECLAIR
