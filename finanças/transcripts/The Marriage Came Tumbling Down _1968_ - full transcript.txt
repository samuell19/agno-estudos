Yes, I know. the 'Mistral', leaving at 1.10. Alright. 'Bye. One Helluva Grandfather Which one are we using for the cover? Sort it out for yourself. I've left already. This is serious. It's for Rachel's column. - This one's not bad. - Yeah. Go with this one. It's better. Alright. See you! Ciao! Have fun! What's with the dress? You want to start a riot? It's the one I wore for the last shot. I didn't want to be late. You said 12.30 sharp. - Okay, let's go. - Kiss me first. Your suitcase! You make my head spin. Is everything there? I hope so. I even put your pajamas in. - For sleeping. - Don't be silly. - Will you write? - Every day. - Promise? - Promise. Don't worry, darling. Three weeks go quickly. A reminder to passengers ...that the 'Mistral' Trans-Europ-Express, can only be boarded... by those with a ticket or an admission form. - OK? - OK. You? Apart from one hell of a job for 2 weeks. I thought I'd never make this train. Trans-Europ Mistral Express leaving at 1.30... ...for Marseille, Toulon... ...Cannes, Nice. All aboard please. Ladies and gentlemen... ...we wish you bon voyage. Here... While I think of it. I think it's essential. I thank you. I agree, it's better. It's ages since I saw you. No one lives forever and at my age... ...we run the risk of checking out one fine morning, without warning. So this year you'll spend your vacation at my place. Do you remember where it is? Down south in Provence. Just outside Lourmarin. I'll be waiting, love Grandpa Hi, Mr Jericho! Howdy, Victor. Nice to see you, Mr Jericho. Sheep report... 3 with signs of contamination. Would you take a detour through Val du Haut Mas? Today it'd be a problem. Go see Doctor Bennac. The other vet? That's 10 km. "The other vet". How many times have I told you? I no longer practice. I'm not a vet any more. Mr Jericho, you've usually... Usually! It's been a bad habit. Alright... I'll drop over tomorrow morning. Thank you, Mr Jericho. Here you are at last! You haven't changed, sweetheart. Don't look very well. - You neither. - Hello, Grandpa. Not getting any younger. Working hard. Don't make me cry! Here... I'll take it. Wake up kiddo! We're here! It's the country air. Marie... Jeanne has prepared an omelet. Light the stove under the frying pan. Yes, boss. So, do you still like living in Paris? It's alright. Yeah? So do you like it or not? We like it there, yes. Are YOU happy? No. Is that him? It's Herbert Gaston Dessalle. Son of the duchess. A red Persian. And a true blue-blood. Doesn't stop him breeding with the peasantry. You've a funny name, old puss. It's his legally. It took an ultimatum to get you two to come. I'd been sure you'd come for one day... The day of my funeral. - Don't exaggerate. - I'm not. I can imagine you reading my letter. Total panic... Right? Spending my holidays with that old dodderer... ...when I could be going to Capri. Picked it in one, eh?! Oh yeah! You smoke? That's new. It's to please Jacques. He loves women who smoke. He thinks it's chic. - What?! - It's true. - Phooey! - It's your little weakness. Well, the only one. Really? Well, admit you're a snob. That's true. When he was 10 years old... ...he insisted that his grandma wear her best dress... ...to go to the village. It was for the honour of the family. Family honour continues. Come on, have some '66 Jericho. Maybe a bit rough, but it won't kill you. Not bad at all. You should know it. I sent you a case. It's not bad! Did YOU drink it up on the sly? It doesn't taste the same to me. What do you think? It seems fruitier. It's the country air. It seems it can change the palate. It's your honeymoon! I'm all in favour. Goodnight, poppet! - Goodnight, big boy. - Goodnight, Grandpa. Goodnight. If it's not too much to ask... ...you might think of making me a great-grandfather. Gosh! Are you encouraging orgies?! Is this how you play the happy marriage? How am I playing it? Badly. Sorry for not having a gift for comedy. Listen... We agreed that Jericho wouldn't get to know anything. You were OK with that. Yes, I'm OK with that. But I'm not accustomed to lying. It comes easily to you... ...for the last 7 years. You've made a habit of it. You exaggerate. I don't lie to you. Not anymore. That's different. You've got it made. Don't start again! Listen, Marie... We agreed not to talk about it anymore for 3 weeks. We agree! We agree! And when the time comes, it turns out differently. You took your freedom. It's your right. But being with you is unbearable to me. I beg you. If you go on like this, it will become impossible. I'm sorry. I'll make an effort. Don't worry, darling. Three weeks go quickly. - Think so? - About what? Nothing. Three weeks. You think there's any point to this comedy? It'd be better to tell Jericho. - Why? - Don't you see why? Why make him upset? It would complicate everything. Funny way of simplifying things. Listen, Marie... Jericho is my grandfather, but he's also your great-uncle. You love him, as I do. We'll always be seeing each other. - Yes, but not one to one. - Why not? Because I want to be able to forget you completely. I was you cousin, then your wife... Am I to become your sister? Well, no way! If I'm not your wife, I won't be anything else! You understand? No, because you don't love me anymore. You aren't going to be sleeping there for 3 weeks. Don't be stupid. Come on. Come to bed. Good morning, Grandpa. Look...! Some of the Martin Wood has been cut down. What a shame. It seems you've forgotten it somewhat. Not at all. I'd recognize the smallest bush in it. Where did you find this? On the console, in the hall. I wanted to update myself with reading matter. I must say, I'm enlightened. Are the women in Paris like that now? More or less, if you ignore the airbrushing. It must be hell. You must feel under pressure with all those hot chicks around. Not in the least. What have you done with Marie? She hasn't woken up. I feel sorry for you, my boy. You abandon your wife in bed... You claim that those chicks don't have any effect on you. I wonder if you're normal. Good morning Grandpa. Sleep well? Not too tired, darling? So, are you happy with your work? I'm not unhappy. I've even had a raise. Didn't you know, Jacques? It was quite recent. I was keeping it as a surprise. It was beautiful here. It was so alive. In your grandmother's time. Get someone to help you. A day labourer or a tenant farmer. It's too complicated. I can't hack it anymore. Not even to supervise. I live on my memories. I love my solitude. I can't stand having strangers around. You see, it's... It would upset me to think you would sell this place. Why do you say that? I have the impression you both love Paris life too much. For me, Paris life... You don't like Paris? Yes, of course I do. But I think I prefer Lourmarin. Look... You hid in there when you were little. One day you found me in there in tears. Jacques wouldn't allow me to call you grandpa. I remember. You said to me... "I love you more than him, and I'll never leave you." I did leave. We rarely keep our promises. It was the promise of little girl. It's sad, all the same. Do you realize what it will take? I promise you, we'll never abandon this place. You seem very sure of yourself. Yes, Jericho. Today, I AM sure of myself. He could have doubled you, like he used to. I'd rather stay put. Showing my age. Showing your age! If people age quickly in Paris, it doesn't show, I'm glad to say. How nice of you to say! I did the right thing, getting you to come. Yes, you did do the right thing. I'll acclimatize quickly again. You'll see. Let's go to the farmyard. We might find some eggs. I'll feed the hens. 4.30... 4.50... 20... 40... 50... makes 5 francs. Goodness! How are you, Jacques?! Hi. - Still here? - As you can see. Weren't you going to America? A dream... I'm engaged. - Who with? - A work colleague. I'd like a Paris number. Kleber 75-13. - Take long? - No. Depends. Is Marie with you? Of course. Hello, Paris? Kleber 75-13, please. Pick it up, it's ringing. There you are. Agatha? Hi, it's me. What do you mean? Me, Jacques. Jacques! You took your time. Were you asleep? Yes. I've only been thinking about that since yesterday. Still love me? My wife doesn't matter. You know that. Yes, I'll write tomorrow. I love you. A big, big, big kiss! 'Bye. It's you? Didn't you recognise me? That doesn't surprise me. You've already forgotten my body. Soon, you'll even have forgotten my face. You're being stupid. Yes, I'm being stupid. Once we used to be stupid together here. Something you've forgotten that I can't forget. I was doing a lot of stupid things in those days. We were young. This is a new adventure for you. You live, you evolve, you change. I get it, and don't blame you. Shall we go back? I'll double you back on the bike. - Coming? - No thanks. I'm in no hurry. I'd rather walk. As you wish. Remi! Damn...! It's Jericho! So... finished your siesta? You coming in? I'm not staying outside in this heat. Cheers! How are you going? Not ill? You're the one who's bothering me, my boy. What have I done? I think you're letting yourself go. Letting myself go? - Do I need to change? - Yes! I have people staying. And you make me ashamed. Have you started caring now? I thought you were over that. It's because of my grandchildren. If they saw me seeing a drunk like you... ...they'd lose respect for me. They're idiots. No, Parisians. Same thing. Don't insult my family. I promise I won't do it again. I'm sure they're great. We gonna hunt? Unbelievable! Would you really like to make me happy? I'll do anything for you. I'm not ungrateful. You saved me from horse-fever. Let me warn you.. I can restart it! Well, I'll make an effort. Do you have a decent suit? A relic of my last unlucky visit to Monte Carlo. You always come dirty and dishevelled to the chateau, to do your number. I've wondered why the Duchess hasn't kicked you out yet. Rubbish! She likes me. I just think it's pretty funny. I play my music for her and she pays me in whisky. Only payment allowed. Well, give the duchess credit. I forbid you to get drunk. What for? Because I want that my Marie sees you on your good days. That you make a good impression on her. That's a different matter. I can be shaved. I can be clean. I can dress up. I can talk. Anything else would be hard. To have enjoyed... your arse on soft grass... Being able to stretch out When I was in love... I would have enjoyed... in the shade without scandal... while keeping a tender heart... long and happy days... to allow my tired bones... to have a rest. Cause harm to nothing... it will take you far. Don't break your arse... know how to laugh loud... with some tender kisses... under a corner of the blue sky. Don't break your arse... know how to laugh loud... with some tender kisses... under a corner of the blue sky. How very true. It's true. Feel like a walk? It's hot. Been to the village? Yes, had to make a call. You could have got me some tobacco. Sorry, I didn't think about it. If you'd told me you were going... Did you see Marie? No. She's bathing at the lake. Go and join her. I don't feel like it. I have work I need to get started on. You use your vacation for work? Yes, when I have to. Hi. Hi. On holiday? Yes. You? In transit. From the Italian "transito", passage. The action of crossing a country or a region... ...to other countries, or regions. Or other feelings. Marie? Don't move. Thank you. What were you doing here? Revisiting. Why didn't you answer me? I didn't want to see you. I was hoping you'd go on your way. You're hiding from me? No, but I need to be alone. But Marie, all I want to do is help you. I know. You're Mr Wonderful. Listen, let's try and act a bit naturally. Like before. I can't be natural with you. I still need time to come to terms with this peculiar arrangement. Then things will be easier. We'll be happy to be here like we used to be. I hope so. I'm happy to be with you here, anyway. I don't think I'll go back to Paris. What do you mean? I've thought about it. It's the best solution. What about Jericho? I'll give him a very plausible story. He won't believe you. That's OK... He'll pretend to believe me. And your work? You can't give that up. I'm not irreplaceable... You certainly know that. I can't talk with you, Marie. You mix everything up. You don't understand a thing. Here, I can be of help to Jericho. At least he'd have some need of me. Look... It's all a mess. We'll restart the operation. I'll replace Jericho's Julia. You're crazy. You'll never be able to. Your life is somewhere else. Allow me to live mine. I need kindness. Generosity. Sincerity. And love, as well. I have them here. What? You've found love? Yes, with Jericho. It's solid, flawless. I can sleep and wake up calmly. Darling, I'm feeling bored and sad. Neither the sun, nor the blue sky, nor the beauty of the countryside... ...can make me forget the sweetness of your body. I want you as much as I want to live. If you only knew how the presence of my wife weighs me down. You kids are not to forget we're going out tomorrow. Yes, to see the duchess. I still don't know why. Just take it as a command. I say we're going out, and I give the orders here. You won't have to put up with me for long. I don't have a suitable dress. Just come in here with me. Come along! I'll show you something You'll see. With this lot, you'll be able to put something together. You're skilful. Make an effort. Look at this. A short one. You're short. It can be shorter. I saw your husband's magazines, you know... I have to admit. Nowadays you can be dressed wearing nothing. That's the fashion! We have to follow the fashion, don't we! Look at this. Looks wonderful. An angel. Wait, I'll get you something. You're no ordinary grandfather. This will suit you. Eh? - Your grace. - Good evening. Do you recognise Marie? Oh, Marie! How lovely to see you again. - My grandson, Jacques. - Hello, Jacques. Come and I'll introduce you to my friends. I've been wanting to tell you. To let such a beautiful piece of land go to waste is criminal. I don't give a damn. You say that and then it's tears at the lawyer's. Are you waiting for me, you old vulture? But you won't see me in your lair. Even posthumously? I'm still sound as a bell. All I see in you is atrophy, senility, and a bad conscience. You're a character, you are! You never change, Jericho. Happily, your grandson doesn't resemble you. - How is life in Paris? - Terrible. Poor Remi, still a drunk, I see. Who's that? A real character. He's lived here 2 years. Boisterous. Gifted, but an alcoholic. You don't know him? Come, you'll find him captivating. Marie, I'd like you to meet Remi. Marie Jericho. - How are you? - Fine thank you. You know each other? We've crossed paths. Well, you'll need to get to know each other better. First, my apologies. I took you for a mermaid. I thought you were a vagabond. You almost scared me. So it's you... little Marie? Yeah. Jericho has often spoken of you. But... ...he's left out the important part. He's going a bit far, isn't he? No... don't be so prudish! It's lovely. A woman likes to be flirted with. Marie... Alas, I should return you to your lord and master. I remain your slave. See you. Why so glum?. Why did Jericho bring us here? He's proud of us. He wants to show us off. I'm sick of people being proud of me. It's pointless. Aren't you proud of anyone? It's difficult. I have to go to the village each time. No, it's not a chore. But it's hard, when you're not there. Marie! - Got everything you need? - Yes. Have you? What are you doing? Going back. How about a walk? Whadda you say? Alright. If you want to. Such beautiful country! Look there's Roussillon. Wonderful. I don't miss Paris. Have you spoken to Jericho? Not yet. Shall you, soon? When the time seems right. Think carefully, before you make such a decision. No. Just being here has made me feel better. And I'll finally get out of this nightmare. We used to play here. - And argue. - And fight. We loved each other. I became your wife. We went on playing for a little while. Then you got bored with the game. I guess you'd become a man. I'll have to resolve to be a woman without you. Isn't it better this way? You hate me. I wish I did. It would make things much easier. I'd like to say... No... don't say anything. Nothing at all. Mr Jericho? Oh... It's you! Can I come in? I guess so. I'd like to know... Have you bottled your whisky? I've made no promises about whisky. And I've forbidden you to drink. You can see that you have no son. What would you know? When I was young... This is not the time. In any case, I knew what a job was. I wasn't a layabout like you. Calm down... I'm able to make amends. I've not had a drink, today. - Possible? - Yes. Out of friendship. - You're kidding me. - Friendship for you Mr Jericho. You know, I like your little Marie very much. Everyone noticed. But I doubt, after your behaviour yesterday, ...that she'll feel the same way about you... I'm glad to say. I'm going to try and erase this bad impression. Your grandson seems likeable too. He's a moron, like you. You're both part of a generation of morons. Come on, grandpa, don't be bitter. Are you staying for dinner? It should be nice outside. Take a walk? Good idea. Coming, Jericho? It's bad for my rheumatism. Coming, Jacques? Me? On a moonlight walk? - I'll go with you. - Good. - OK with you? - Go ahead. You're confident! In your place, I'd be mistrustful. - You're joking? - No, not at all. I don't know your Remi, but I know Marie. You may know her too well... Or not well enough. Submissive, eh? Rebel. Out of necessity. Same things. You exclude, without logic, or autonomy. - You're nasty. - Just lucid. I've known a lot of women. - They aren't all like that. - Yes, it's physiological. Women attach themselves. Yes. Women attach themselves. I'm stupid. I've hurt you. - No you haven't. - Yes, and I'm sorry. Because you must be an exceptional woman. That's nice of you. I wasn't being nice. It's just what I believe. Since you know her so well... What do you think of her? - What do I think of her? - Yeah! Everyone has a mixture of good and bad points. Your grandmother for example... ...was the epitome of kindness, generosity, honesty. Yet there were times when she was insufferable. A mixed-up personality. Stubborn, yet susceptible. We didn't always agree. So... Marie? She certainly has her qualities. And faults. She's quite demanding. Proud. They're not faults. They're qualities. I don't know. Maybe she's perfect. Surely not. Nobody is perfect. Well, there you are... You still don't know her. So start looking, my boy. On that note, I shall retire to bed. Nice walk? Fantastic. - Jericho? - Gone to bed. Fine, then I'll be off. Goodnight. Thanks for this evening. Odd character, that Remi. Don't you think? Strange in a way. Interesting. Shame he's an alcoholic. He was alright today. Very lucid in fact. What did he talk to you about? He's like anyone else. He talked about himself. About his adventures? Among other things. He said one thing that struck me. About a woman who he lived in Paris with and who ruined him. He said she got under his skin. You haven't heard that expression? Yes, of course. But I've never had anyone I spoke with actually use it. It's pretty common. Rather banal. Banal? Why? Having a woman under your skin... It's a pretty thought. Apart from that? Is this an interrogation? Not at all. Pass me that brush. Are you sulking? Go and get dressed... It's nearly time for your trip to the post office. I'm not going. Oh yes, you're going! And even... Mr Jacques Jericho? From the office. Nothing serious? No, just some photo problems. Marie... I need to explain... That life goes on? I'm aware of that. No... Just listen to me. - It's not simple. - It's very simple. It's you who makes it complicated. What do you mean? - I'd been thinking... - About that night? What difference does it make? Haven't you understood anything? There's nothing to understand. It could have been settled when we first arrived. A whore or your wife. It's all the same to you. Mr Jericho? Remi? What's up? Nothing serious. I came to ask Jericho to come to the farm. At this ungodly hour? Go and bother someone else. Anything involving you is a catastrophe! No. The foal doesn't want to come out. The farmer's beside himself... He risks losing his mare. I'm sure he's left it to the last minute. That imbecile! Will you go? Well... alright. - I'll go with you. - If that's what you want. So this is the filly? It won't come out by itself. - Have the hooves come out? - 3 hours ago. 3 hours? You should have fetched me much earlier! - You think it's hopeless? - Don't know yet. Come and undress. To think that life starts like this! Not nice to see. That doesn't move you? Yes, but it's still pretty disgusting. This is too painful. I'm going to get a drink. Join me? No thanks, I'll stay here. It's not something unpleasant. It's like a test. You're a romantic. Dangerous, that. Beware. You shouldn't have come. It's not funny. I was worried. I couldn't sleep. - How did it go? - With difficulty. Grandpa was amazing. Good girl! And a brave one. All the same... How did you enjoy the show? Stunning. This is the sort of thing... ...that teaches you to respect a woman. Goodnight, Marie. Goodnight, Remi. - You live here? - Yes, that surprise you? - No. - Want to come in? Afraid to? Something wrong? Relax. Take a seat. Like a drink!? You sure? Nothing like it, against cockroaches. You've made a change... Now you're having second thoughts. Is it that obvious? Nothing should be taken too seriously. Why make a big deal of it? What does that achieve? Yes things do happen that you can't do anything about. You just have to accept them. No. Just let yourself be carried away by events. Like floating on your back. The stream takes you somewhere else, where everything's different. - Or starts all over again. - If that's what you want. Starts again... but differently. That's what's great about it. Everything starts again, but nothing's the same. - I was imagining you as a sceptic. - No... not a sceptic. A dedicated egoist. Everyone else can go to hell. Apart from some rare exceptions. You don't need anyone? Sure, but most of the time, I manage on my own. There's sun, butterflies... ...wind and rain. Storm. I think I feel alive in the midst of the worst disasters. They still keep me happy. It's wonderful to be alive. I need others in order to feel alive. Up until now... ...everything was conditioned by other people. You mean one other person. Yes, one other. I only existed through him. For him. It's truly idiotic. No it's not idiotic. It's called selflessness, that's all. You have to convince yourself that it doesn't matter. We never do what's best. Nothing beats tears. Put yourself first. The others don't matter. Don't wait for anyone else to be happy. Live for yourself, Marie. Marie... You coming? What were you doing in there? Nothing. Just talking - I find him a bit over the top. - I think he's very nice. - He thinks too much of himself. - Meaning? Nothing. - The way we're carrying on is stupid. - You're right. - You don't understand. - Understand what? That we're going to spoil everything. It's too late now to talk about it. No, we have to talk about it. - I love you, Marie. - No, Jacques! Don't say that! You say it too often elsewhere. - But with you it's true. - Get your hands off! I'm finished with being an object. I want to be a woman. The woman who's my wife. No, just as a woman. A free woman. - Free? - Yes, I want to be free. Free for whom? For Remi? Is he the one who's given you these ideas? How's the foal? It's dead. What are you up to? Getting drunk on your own? I'm drinking to the birth of a new day... In the absence of a foal. Yeah... Have a drink, Grandpa... It'll buck you up. I'm no use anymore. Growing old is infuriating. Don't think about it. You did everything possible. You think it was enough... ...to do everything possible? You'd be easy to please. What's the point in lamenting over it? Drink up, Grandpa. This stuff's piss! The fucked-up generation, eh? Don't you ever tell yourself you're a miserable jerk? - I'm a miserable jerk. - Right. Has it never occurred to you that you lack courage? Sure. But you've got enough for two. I'm not easily fooled! Maybe I'm just an upstanding middle-class retiree... ...who was always faithful to his wife. Jesus Christ! If I told you how many times I almost left her? Really? "Really?" Don't believe that with my face, opportunities were lacking. Yeah. I've had my share of adventures. Oh yeah! Yep! Yeah. But none of those... ...beautiful, busty, appetizing girls. Or any of those scrawny sticks photographed in your magazines. Oh yeah! Mr Jericho knows how to live. You have a wife. It takes a lifetime to really know your wife. A woman who gave you her youth... her love... That counts for something! Do you think you'll often get offered such things? Do you believe in the moon? To always conduct yourself like a man. That's what life's about. Boy! This stuff's not so bad. Oh yeah! Cheers! My poor head! Your husband made me drink poison. - It was he who made you drink? - Yes, who else would it be? I bought whisky for you two. I don't usually drink that piss. I didn't even know where the bottle was. It was him. You let him get plastered like that? Not a good idea, my girl. What's going on with you two? We've been quarrelling. Not about anything important. Not important? Nothing's important with you two. This century is unimportant. The atom bomb is unimportant. My face is unimportant. I'm sorry. It's partly my fault you're not feeling well. You've nothing to be sorry for, my sweet, but... the way I am... I need to get over it quickly. It's the duchess's fiesta, tonight. She's counting on me to liven up the evening. I can't go there looking like death warmed up. Don't worry, by this evening you'll be old yourself again. How's Jericho feeling? In the state you put him in. Worse than you. So it's my fault again! Everything's my fault! I am the enemy! Coming? I don't feel much like dancing. - Don't bother about me. - As you wish. Oh, I used to love to dance, Jericho! I was indefatigable! Besides, the duke was a perfect dance-partner. Were you a dancer, Jericho? Was I ever! I'd still be pretty good. But would you call this dancing? We had the tango, the two-step... That was good, too. And then the Charleston. The Charleston was good, too. Have you dumped your husband? - He's running wild. - Be careful. If young husbands are given free rein... ...they'll take advantage of it. - That's him! This new generation! You shouldn't have come. I was going crazy after your last call. You don't understand... I couldn't bear it anymore. Jacques. Do you love me? Of course, darling. I love you. This is for you. Thank you. That's sweet of you. - Shall we dance? - We'll dance. Jacques, come close to me. Don't be silly. Not here. Come along! Tomorrow, Jacques, come and join me at Arles. I can't just leave like that. What would I tell them? And I've got no business in Arles. Listen, Jacques... - You have to come. Otherwise... - Otherwise? I don't know what I'll do. Alright... I'll try to come. You'll see, you'll appreciate why I couldn't wait. Women are impossible! Just a pain in the arse! Do you know what I want? A room, 3 metres by 4. Where I'll live alone. Or go away. Anywhere... but alone. I've had enough, do you understand? I'm fed up, fed up, fed up! I can't take it anymore. I'm at a total loss. My poor baby. You're unhappy. I have to see her tomorrow. Marie... I'm asking you to help me. How could I do that? I don't really know where I'm at, myself. I'd be just as in need of help, myself. Jacques has left. I heard the car. He went to see a colleague in Aix. Some complicated business matter. Don't worry, my pet. I'm not worried. You know, there aren't all that many road accidents. They exaggerate. You know, Jericho... Things aren't going well between Jacques and me. Goodness, you must take me for a simpleton. So I guess it's hard to hide. I've had my doubts for a long time. I didn't need to see you to know that. Mainly the tone of your letters. And the fact you only signed them with your name alone. Jacques has never written to me. No time, doubtless. Is that why we're here? I wanted to see how things really were with you both. You're first-rate actors. We didn't want to upset you. - Do you blame us? - On the contrary. At least it proves... ...how much I still mean to you. We both love you, Grandpa. I never doubted it. It'll work out. It's nothing... Nothing more than a hiccup. - You think he's coming back? - Of course he'll come back! I know him well, you see. What else could he do? I ask you! We are both his roots, Marie. You're his life. No one else counts. Is it far from here? About 20 kilometres. It's heavenly. You coming to eat, my pet? No. I couldn't swallow a thing. God, what a waste! You know, Grandpa, I think I'm going to stay with you. That's ridiculous, for goodness sake! What are you talking about? You're not going to leave your husband? He's leaving me. Marie, my sweet, you have to use your feminine wiles. What have you done... ...to try and fix things? It was your pride that ruined everything. Love requires a little humility. Of course. Maybe you're right. I was too proud. I want you, you know. - What's wrong? - Nothing. It's this room. - What about it? - Ii feels strange. You need a friendly room to be able to want me? I need to be in my own environment. Didn't I ever tell you that? No. My room in Paris was new to you, the first time. However... Exactly. That's where I wanted to get out of. Your room in Paris was a mistake. A mistake? Agathe, I need to talk to you. So talk. If only you understood, I'd be less unhappy. You're unhappy? Yes. I'm not going to leave Marie. And you've chosen to give me up for her? That'd be the easiest. You can walk out the door, whistling. You leave nothing behind. No, it's not like that. I'm not leaving you for any trivial reasons. I was in love with a man. And I was counting on spending my life with him. How stupid was that? It's not worth the pain, to talk about it. You've every right to blame me. But you're wrong. I love my wife. So you lied to me. - You lied to me the whole time. - No, Agathe. I was lying to myself. - What becomes of me in all this? - Calm down - You know you're beautiful. - Please! Just stop it! You're going to start preaching. "You're young." "You're beautiful." "One day you'll meet a handsome young man." You eaten? No, and I'm starving. So Jericho, shall we go? All of a sudden, you're in a hurry. I didn't want to keep you waiting my boy. Say, Remi... Next time, I'll come and fetch you, instead. I don't want to bother you. - No, I'll explain. - You've got problems? No, but... ...those two from Paris... ...who came to see me. Well, I don't want to disturb them. Do I have to spell it out?!
