You're the kid who was home schooled. Yeah. How'd you know? I was assigned to write an article for the school paper. It was either a feature on you Or the new four-Color ink pens at the student store. Four colors in one pen? No! That's impossible. Yeah, well, I'd rather be writing a hard-Hitting investigative piece But nothing ever happens around here. I'm jessica matthews. Hi. - Harry dunne. - What's going on here?

Lloyd: by your mom? * all you got to feel it, all right. * Woman: and principal collins, You'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesday's are "south of the border" days. We'll be serving a spicy tuna tamale Along with a three-Cheese quesadilla. Sounds like it's going to be another... Hot year in the kitchen. - Hello? - Collins: yes? What is it? Sir, it's time for morning announcements. Yes, i... I'm aware of that. Yes. Um... Why don't you make the announcements this morning, dear? - But what should i announce? - Woman: tell her about the quesadillas. - Make something up! - Okay. Well, that was a mood breaker. You know, honey... I think i've finally figured out a way To bilk this school out of enough money To get us that condo in waikiki. How, sweet baby? You've done it all. Small potatoes. This is the big one. This is visionary. This idea is genius. Look at this. The richard moffitt special needs grant. - Mm-Hmm. - This moffitt guy used to be in a special needs program, And then he learns to string a couple of sentences together And now he's some big hotshot. Anyway, the state is giving 100 grand in his name To every school that has a special needs class. - This is fantastic! - Mm-Hmm. All we have to do is kill this moffitt guy And we get all the money. No, no. What we need is to set up a fake special needs class. We start our own class. Problem is, where do we find kids... We can pass off as special? Lloyd: okay, that's high enough! - Thanks, turk. - I'm flying! Woo-Hoo! Harry: so this is what a flag sees all day. - Yeah. - And your friend turk is totally great. Yeah, he's aces, huh? Hey, thanks, turk! We're so high! Bingo. Welcome to special needs orientation. I'm ms. Heller, the lunch lady. And it... Damn. I mean, your new teacher. Yeah. Now the reason you two are here before class officially starts Is because you're... Extra special. Thank you. And were personally selected by principal collins. Who's principal collins? - He's the principal. - Wow. Your first assignment Is to pick the rest of the class. Hey! Find students that are just as special as you two. Special. What? Is... Is this gonna be on the midterm? No. You know, you're the first person i ever brought here, harry. - Is this your special place? - No, i just usually eat in the crapper. Yeah, saves time. Out with the old, in with the new. - Could we eat there tomorrow? - Yeah, but first we need to find kids That are special, needy, and classy enough to be in our special needs class. It'll be like taking candy from a stranger. - Lloyd: "har-Ery"? - The second "r" is silent. Oh, that makes much more sense. Oh, little crippled boy. Look. Our first recruit. - His curse is our blessing. - Careful, harry, don't scare him. Hey, little guy. Hey little orphan buddy. - What happened? - Skateboard. - One day, they'll find a cure. - You brave little soldier. What? No, man, it's nothing. The cast comes off in a few weeks. He's obviously in denial. Maybe we can help. We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady. I mean, ms. Heller. You should join up. It doesn't require any walking. No one will make fun of your horrible deformity. - How much homework is there? - That's the downside. - There's none. - Dude, dude. Wait a minute, i can spend the whole year In a class taught by the lunch lady? Yeah. - Can i bring my girlfriend? - You can bring whatever you want, my little friend. All right. * yeah * * here we go * * it's a new day, but it all feels old * * it's a good life that's what i'm told * * but everyday, it all just feels the same * * at my high school, it felt more to me * * like a jail cell, a penitentiary... * - Harry dunne, special needs. - Lloyd: he's with us.

What do you think of when you think of thanksgiving? - Like cranberries and indians. - Football! Football, yeah! Get some! Good for you. No. Oh hey, lewis has got a good idea. George washington. - Wow! - Harry: who? - He only invented money. - Very good, lloyd. How about a float of george washington crossing the delaware? - Ooh, or maybe a river. - Like the atlantic. Okay, so it's settled. This is gonna be the greatest thanksgiving ever. You mean we have to... We have to parade around in front of everyone? On a float of george washington? - We're gonna look like idiots. - Exactly. No chance. We are not doing it. No effing way. Hey! Hey, did i mention That if you don't make a float, it's back to homework? And... real grades. How would you like that? Oh... And actually having to attend class. No. Which means, you won't be so special anymore. * crack that whip * * give the past the slip... * That's what i was talking about. * break your momma's back * * now whip it * * into shape * * shape it up * * get straight * * go forward * * move ahead * * try to detect it, it's not too late * * to whip it * * whip it good. * Hey, guys, check it out. Jessica: thanks, principal collins, for giving me this interview. Anything i can do to help. So, you had some questions? Yes, actually. Last year, toby was in ap english, And lewis won the science fair. What are they doing in this new special needs class? Well, that's a poor question. It's wordy, pedantic... A good question gets right to the point. Example... Where's my chest? Chest? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, i think you do. You know, my parents are gonna wonder where i am. One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear. hello, it's me, brenda. Jessica's friend? Yeah, we're going to be pulling an all-Nighter In the library tonight, 'Cause we have a big exam tomorrow. Macro... economics, And it's really hard. Lloyd: ooh, they still have my two favorite flavors, Cherry and green. - Yeah. - Oh, hey, fellas. You want some of this? Yeah. Oh, it's gonna be good. You know what? I'm gonna go crazy. I'm gonna have two flavors. Suicide of deliciousness. - That looks so tasty, harry. - Oh god, i want that. - He's mixing them. - Oh, it's gonna taste so good. I was right. It's really good. He's so lucky. Mmm, mmm. Suck it. I want one. We can't go in there. We'll be it. You're right... we can't. Come here. Hey, hey, little buddy. Hi, how ya doin'? Hey, you want to make $2? - Sure. - Yeah? Okay, all you got to do is go in there and get us two slushees. - Okay. - Okay, as in we got a deal? Yeah, deal. But first, give me the $2. i said "doll hairs." Psych. But a deal's a deal. In you go, little buddy. - Come on. - Fine, give me the doll hairs. - Harry? - A deal's a deal. Would you take five bucks instead? Good thinking, harry. Good thinking. All right, be cool. Be cool. Be cool. yeah, and she's like, "you better call my mom." And i'm like, "whoa," and she's like, "oh." And i'm like... It's brenda. I'm new. Lloyd: oh! Ice, ice, baby. Yeah, i peed in those. Enjoy. Grow up. - You're it. - Are not. - Are too. - D2. - Chewbacca. - Ooh, good one, harry. Hey, it's jessica. Harry, i thought we worked through this. No, it's jessica. Lloyd: oh, must be her boyfriend's car. - It's principal collins! - Principal collins is jessica's boyfriend? Oh, that totally makes sense. That's why she didn't want him to know We were in his office the other night. He can't see us here. Quick, be conspicuous! Conspicuous? No wonder we both struck out with her. How can we compete with the sexual power of the man Who occupies the highest office in the land. Yeah, he's like the pope, harry. Like we're gonna snake a chick from the pope. Here he comes. Harry, switch. Harry. Jeez, moses and mary. Hey, let's go spy on them. Good thinking, harry. - Harry, bobsled! - Lever! Hang two! Harry, go left! Go left. Cease and desist! Cease and desist! Come on, harry! Mush, mush, mush. Harry, go straight. Warp speed, harry. Warp speed! Is that the best you've got? Hey, that's my cart. * it's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight * * risin' up to the challenge of our rivals * * and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night... * Ice cream? Are you thinking what i'm thinking, harry? - Oh yeah. - Snack break! Harry: yummy! - Aaah! All right... - Harry! - There they are! - Break's over! So what did you tell my parents on the phone? Not to expect you tonight. Well, someone's going to come looking for me. Oh, i don't think so, my dear. * the eye of the tiger. * I'm going to ask you one more time. Jessica, Where's my chest? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't know what i'm talking about, hmm? You don't know what i'm talking about?! Well, well, well. What have we here? It appears to be a tape. - That's not your tape. - Don't play with me, dear. You're way out of your league. Harry: jessica! Harry, lloyd. You guys are a mess. Harry: we were still hungry, so we decided to get some dessert. - It was fun. - Lloyd: yeah. It was fun until harry decided to put his wiener in my ear. - Sorry about that. - It's all right. So it looks like the best man won. Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was principal collins? What? Lloyd on tape: jessica! - * you light up my life... * - Is that my mix tape? It's being used for your seduction? I'm flattered. Lloyd, when we were in principal collins office, Did you see any kind of chest? You mean like harry's treasure chest? Sure, i know where that is. You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me? Three words... I did. You were just all mad at me. You wouldn't even listen. - Yeah, well, i'm listening now. - Me too. - This is my favorite part. - Harry, lloyd, Listen to me, i only have time to say this once. Lloyd's voice: god, she's so cute. Look at her teeth. I bet she can bite through anything. Yeah, she could. You gotta get what's in the chest, and make sure everybody... Harry's voice: i wonder what lloyd's thinking about. Look at all that hair. She must have millions of tiny holes in her head. Otherwise, it would just bunch up all in her brain. So guys, are you listening to me? - Yeah, sure! - Yeah, yeah. - I was, you know... - Yeah, sure. Lloyd on tape: i'm a pisces. And that's the sign of the badger. I love picnics... You guys gotta go get that chest, And show the world what collins has been doing. Don't worry about me. I can get out of this anytime i want. And i'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of. Lloyd on tape: come on, jessica. Don't push me, 'cause i'm... Go, get out of here. - Gotcha, you... - Stop! - What? - I don't think this is the right thing to do. Harry, we don't even know what's in there. You're overreacting. I don't know who we are anymore. You're right. But i feel like i deserve much more of this treasure - 'Cause i was the one that found it. - My mom gave me the map. - But i lugged it all over town. - I made the polar bear pants. - I ate your mom's pie! - I found that rock! It was a diamond, and you swallowed it. We were all out of top hats. Enough! What has this cursed chest done to us? You know, lloyd, The real treasure is our friendship. Yeah, you're right. On the other hand... Oh. What's all this? Oh... it's full of files. There's pictures And documents. It's amazing! Ohhh. Hey, lloyd, this looks like one of your mix tapes. Maybe it's from the pirate who buried this treasure. You should go put it on. Collins on tape: principal's log, september 23rd. Check, check, check. Sound check. Hey, it's principal collins. That makes total sense. I found the treasure chest in his office. - Grant money... - This mix tape isn't as good as yours, lloyd. - No. - Sound, check, check, check. - He speaks pretty good chinese. - That's not chinese. That's chinese. - Yeah. - Oh yeah. And that is how i, principal collins, Became the mastermind behind this glorious plan. It's the crime of the century. He's right. We have committed the crime of the century. We never thanked him for giving us the special needs class! But what do we do? Lloyd: i have an idea. Welcome to the providence hills high school Thanksgiving parade! Aren't you glad you're not watching football? This year's theme, white meat or dark? Floats and exhibits from all classes and organizations. So enjoy. What the hell is that? What did you morons do? Where's george washington? What do we do with this? - Looks great, doesn't he? - No. - What were you guys thinking? - Terri: why'd you give him a makeover? Sorry i'm late. Woke up tied to the bed. Somebody cut my hair while i was sleeping. Hey, that's my hair! It's the marching band's musical tribute to stuffing. Please do not throw cigarettes at the floats. I've searched everywhere and no luck. The chest is still out there. That's why we get the check as soon as zimmer shows up And blow this pop stand before anybody finds out anything. The band sounds terrible. I know, i sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian air, business class. - You like your new coat? - I love it. That's why our mascot isn't a stallion anymore. - This is horse? - No, no, no, i sold the horse, - To pay for the... - I didn't know horse could feel this soft. That's not horse, honey. Yes, yes, it is soft. So what do you think of the float? - Guys, this is much better. - Yeah. Principal collins is a way greater american Than george washington will ever be. I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate? I'll tell you why. You won't believe these documents. They provide evidence of a long history of fraud and embezzlement From the school by principal collins and ms. Heller, A.K.A. The lunch lady. - Huh? - My god, can you believe your ears? Yeah, no clicks and whistles. She speaks the english perfectly. Lloyd, you're a great teacher. Ching chong, what happened to your beautiful asian accent? Oh, actually my name is cindy. The accent just helps me meet boys. You want it back? you got it, joe. Look at this. Collins took $2000 That was supposed to go to a new state-Of-The-Art stallion mascot uniform. Wait, what? Let me see. Why have i been wearing this one with puke in the head? - You serious? - Am i... Smell. We got to tell people about collins. - Hey, superintendent. - I'm not sure i can do this. We got to nail this guy. You'll be fine. Just make sure he takes that check. Detective, you know, He's gonna be expecting moffitt to be... special. Don't worry about it. I studied acting at the police academy. - Police academy? - You'll be fine. Just remember your lines. It's show time. - Principal collins. - Superintendent zimmer. - Hello. - Hello, hello. I'd like to introduce you to richard moffitt, Former special needs student, now american success story. - Well... - Go ahead. It's a very great pleasure to meet you, sir. Very... Very great pleasure. Well, is that what i think it is? Your little gift for the school? Yes. I drew this.
