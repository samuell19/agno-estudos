H.Q. to all units... Minato-ward, roadside alert... Calling for a motorbike fire. Fire department present but traffic control needed... See him? Not yet. When he comes out... You know what you've got to do? Here he is. Sure it's him? It's him. Hang on. Let's go. Bayside P.D. Bayside P.D.? Good morning, Commissioner. We're here to pick you up. And take you to the golf course. "Takahiko Country Club." Allow us to escort you. I'm your driver today, Aoshima... Forget that, get his bag. Let me help you. A lovely day for it. This way, please. Remember, drive safely. Don't worry, Sir. But don't make us late either. Welcome to the 15th Police Command golf tournament. Firstly, Commissioner Yoshida will start the event. Right into the pond. "BAYSIDE SHAKEDOWN" Good morning. What's good about it? We'll soon pull him out. I wonder if it's a murder? I hate "floaters". Always stinky. Swollen up, too. If it floats to that bank... it'll be their responsibility. From the center of the river, it's our jurisdiction. Bayside precinct, go home. I see what you mean. So we do nothing. Just wait for it to float? My back's hurting, too. Good work today. Not my best score, though. You looked great, covered in sand. Congratulations on your booby prize. Don't remind me. These smoke balls are great. I'll give them to you. What do I want them for? Be grateful. You're lucky. Here you go... Not for me. Why are you hanging about? Welcome back. No peace for the wicked. How's the new job? I wish I could retire. He got the booby... What are they? Smoke balls. Rainbow smoke balls. I had them made. They give off colored smoke. So you were out playing golf? Helping the chief. Easy work for some. Give me a break. My pay's being docked for three months. But if I do as I'm told, they'll reduce it to two. If you roll them like this, they say it's good for your health. What's that smell? Another mutilated corpse. Suicide? They're doing an autopsy. Welcome back. You begin today? Yes, I've finished training. They've made her a detective already. You said we needed a translator. She's the only one who speaks English. I'm going to watch the autopsy. Who's coming with me? I'll see you later. See ya. Come on. Yukino. You need the experience. See you all later. Have fun. That'll stop her eating burgers for a while. Lieutenant. Make a report on that corpse. Inspector, would you prepare it for me? Aoshima, can you do it? We're drinking with the traffic cops next week. Can I come along? If you write the report. Okay. So I end up doing it? I've got to do my expenses. Where are all my receipts? I dunno. Hang on, what about my wallet? Where's it gone? My watch isn't here. What's all the fuss about? All my receipts have gone. How? I can't find my wallet. Why not? And my watch. What? Ow! Officer, you're overreacting. They've cut my pay, so I'm working extra hard. Watch where you're going. Sumire, a robbery! Location? Here. Where? Here. Out of the way! Keep back. Get back to work! Step back, step back. You're in our way. Back, back, back. Keep out of the way. Keep out of the way. Policemen shouldn't get in the way. Policemen shouldn't get robbed. Watch your damn mouth! Please give witness statements. Come on. What the hell's going on in here? What have you been doing? Me? It's a problem with the security. So, what was taken? Receipts, from questioning. That's all? Why would someone take them? How much for? Fifty thousand yen. It's 'cause you leave them lying about. I don't have time to file them. They'll come out of your own pocket. Please find out who did it. Will you buy me dinner, then? Got the press under control? If this gets out... It'll be my neck on the block. Inspector, what's up? That corpse from the river... It might need a special investigation. Special investigation? Wasn't it suicide? Doubt it. No way. We can't allow a special investigation. A man has been killed. Staff come from H.Q. for special investigations... we have to pay for their meals, transport, the lot. Investigations are paid for by local precincts. It'll be at least 10 million yen. When we did it before, we went broke. Inspector, are you sure it can't be a suicide? What are you talking about? Any proof it's a homicide? Well... Victim profile? Kunio Harada, businessman, 31 years old. We checked his ID. External injury? None. Water in his lungs? None. Dead before he went in the water. But if there's no wound... No wound but... A surgical scar. Everyone's got one of those. It's very recent. Couldn't have been done by a doctor. What do you mean? Someone cut him open... Then sewed him back up with thread. Why? This was in his stomach. In his stomach? Stuffed inside. Larceny suspects. Maybe you saw them here. Take a good look. There's so many. It's your turn for a change. Keep your eyes off it. What the hell is that? Is it about the body? We were just going to report. Or maybe it's about the petty theft? I guess not. Let's get on the case. Aoshima! Coming. Aoshima! Something's up. What? Helicopters from H.Q. With tons of gear. It's like they're moving in. That's the Commissioner's wife. That Commissioner? Do you know him? I drove him to golf this morning. These are for you. What are you doing? Why don't you let us know what's going on? This is purely an H.Q. matter. Nothing to do with local police. Can we name the operations room? Go ahead. Let's get a move on. Okay. There's been a kidnapping, right? Carry on with your normal work. But these are our streets. Let's go, Aoshima. He doesn't give a shit about the streets any more. What about your promise? You promised to look out for us. Do you still believe him? Muroi... It's not within my authority... The orders come from above. We just heard that the Commissioner was kidnapped From outside his house. A man called to say, "we've got the President". "President"? The junior officers nickname the upper ranks like company staff, chairman..." "President".. for Christ sakes. We got a second call from the suspect this afternoon. The same voice: "The President's fine, we'll call again” Nine seconds on line, we couldn't trace it. It was a stolen 800Mhz cellular phone. Report on our current placement. Sections 7 and 8 are taking statements from his family. A search team is stationed in his neighborhood. Witnesses? We're holding off until we know the suspect isn't around. A communications section is at the phone company. Financial affairs are talking to the bank about ransom money. Any motives? The suspect uses police slang... Community affairs are checking retirees, activists and religious groups. And the press? We've got an agreement. They'll keep quiet until it's solved. Report to H.Q. that we've set it up, by the book. Why are we being kept in the dark? And what are you doing? Deciding a name for the operations center... to put next to the door. This is the only role we have. So...Aoshima, write this on the board. How about..."Commissioner Kidnap Operations Center" Not bad. Let's do it. Wait a minute. What's his name? Yoshida. Shouldn't we write his name? He is our Commissioner. Okay. "Commissioner Yoshida Kidnap Operations Center" He's high-ranking...we can't ignore that. You're right. Okay. "Honorable Commissioner Yoshida Kidnap Operations Center" Really high-ranking. Okay. "Venerable Commissioner Yoshida Kidnap Operations Center" "Venerable"...that's strange. It's not Shakespeare. Sounds too formal. Okay. "Mr. Yoshida Kidnap Operations Center" Are you trying to be funny? No, we're not. It's a serious matter. That's right. If this ends well, we'll be in his good books. So we need to make a nice, encouraging title. Good idea. Okay. "Hang on in there, Commissioner" Then, "Kidnap Operations Center" That's great. Let's do that. "Commissioner Kidnap Operations Center" "Commissioner Kidnap Operations Center" Straight to the point. Great. Nice. What are you doing? Don't you think it's a good name? We put a lot of thought into it. It's a covert investigation. Placards are forbidden. Don't you read the police manual? Is that right? I understand. Commander wants me to step down. What does that mean? There's no harm in telling you... If this case gets messed up, someone's for the chop. He doesn't want to risk my guaranteed promotion. He's from Tokyo University too. You went to a regional college? Yes, I did. So you better try and do your best here. What are you saying? It's not me... it's the Commander. That I head the investigation? It's a good idea, if you think of your future... Finally my studies are paying off. Aoshima. About that body... Isn't there a special investigation? Not enough money. Anyway, everyone's on the kidnap case. What about the Inspector? He went straight to investigate the kidnap. Sometimes, he's so naive. And Mashita? Over here. Mashita. We went to the victim's house. Single guy, living alone...in love with his computer. Obsessed with the internet. We've got a record of his favorite sites. What are they like? Murder info. sites, killing know-how. That kind of thing. That's hard-core. There's one chat room he always visited. This is it. "Murders of the Imagination” They advertise for people who want to die. Then discuss how to kill them in their virtual world. The victim hated work... said he wanted to die. They killed him for fun. Just online, of course. Weird stuff. Not really. In America, there was that case... Where they actually killed a guy who was suicidal. American crimes usually get copied in Japan. Find out who created that web-site. I'll ask the server. Hang on. Let's chat. Thanks. Come here...c'mon... What? Take a look at this. Come on. I'm busy. About our robbery. Look. What happened? Oh, now you've found time to listen! I'm only human. Jerk. Tell him. We work at a computer game show... and all our stuff was stolen from the dressing room. Fancy picking on defenceless girls. Stick to the point. That room is off-limits. Tightly guarded? No. What do you mean? Anyone in a costume can get in. Costume... How do you think the thief got in here? Impossible in regular clothes. Nobody suspects if you're in uniform. Maybe it was the same guy. I'll check the records. We'll catch him and wring his neck. Sumire. Do whatever you want but... Make sure you get my receipts. Yeah, yeah. What? Any progress? None of your business. We've got no idea how they did it. I had a little look, myself. Haven't you checked for witnesses? The manual forbids investigation of the crime scene. The suspect might be watching. Don't do anything stupid. Screw the manual. Inspector, where are you going? We got the third call ten minutes ago. Video. Hello. Listen to what I say. Is my father well? Who's this? Mother's not well. I'm his daughter. She's one of ours. Is my father there? Let me hear him. A hundred million yen in the phone box at "Dreamland” tomorrow. I'll write it down...please repeat. 25 seconds on line. It's gone. Same phone; we got the relay point. We can trace the next call. Let's do as he says. Work out our positions. We're doing it. Have the ransom ready. It should be standing by. It is. But there's only fifty million in special bills. It's Muroi. The other fifty million from public funds? Please. The Police Agency will get it. Why us? Can't the Metropolitan Division do it? No way. You've got to. As long as it's quick, it doesn't matter. You don't get it. Get what? If you lose public funds, the Finance Ministry... will cut your budget as punishment. I'm asking the Police Agency. We can't pay. Seen any of those guys around here? That looks good. It's a treat...for when you finish. Okay. Special investigators get 2,000 yen lunch boxes. Two thousand? That's just plain discrimination. At least give us a proper lunch. Don't even get weekends off... Why am I working so hard? "Letter of Resignation” What's the point in working like this? Sumire...Sumire Over here. What is it? Sit down. Lunch boxes from upstairs? They were left over. What about mine? I want one. Forget it. Now, this investigation... Still working on it. It's about your expenses. You're spending too much. All this food? Undercover in a restaurant. 50,000 yen in taxis? Tailed someone to Shizuoka... Medical costs? Hurt my foot, breaking down a door. Stop eating. You too. Huh? Okay. What about Aoshima? He's worse. Leave him alone. Why? He's already in the doghouse. Because his were stolen? Ever heard the word "thrift"? Heard it...but you need to risk money. 'Cause we risk our lives... Risk your lives but don't risk our money. Scale down our efforts, is that it? We're not saying don't catch criminals. There are just too many receipts. We want cheaper arrests. Are you listening? Chief. We were given them. Fifty million yen!? In cash, by tonight. It's your responsibility. I've got to do it? Chief...we're counting on you. There's no way I can get hold of that. I've already got a mortgage, an auto loan... I used my pension fund for my golf membership. Didn't 1? Borrowed money. It's not a personal loan. "Emergency expense” from the contingency fund. Is that what you mean? You had me worried. What a shock. Only fifty million. There was a ransom note? The hand-over's tomorrow at noon. I'll do it. It's a dangerous job... But someone's got to do it. It's heavy. I'll be okay. Where is it? Who the hell would trust you with that? Number all these. They're not in sequence. Every single one. And no sticky fingers. Okay...get a move on. All of them? He's taking the bait. Glad to chat with a girl. Make it sexy. He says he wants to meet. Pretend to hesitate... Then agree to see him. I'll try. One million finished. We'll be here all night. I'm starving. Boss. Wow. What's up? About that murder... we checked out the web-site. And? The guy behind it is crazy. Said he was cutting my body into pieces. What a waste. Please be serious. She's meeting him tomorrow. Where? The Queen's Square Cafe at noon. Boss. Aoshima. The H.Q. boys are too busy so let's do it ourselves. Okay. Help us number these. Alright. All these? It won't be done by morning. Everyone. Let's show 'em what we can do. We'll get it all done. Why not just photocopy them? Don't be stupid! Right? I guess we shouldn't do it like this... Take it away. Calling all units... To your positions and standby. Operation will begin as scheduled. What the hell's this? Today at noon, They'll hand over the ransom. Continue normal duties. Any call from the suspect, will be relayed to these earphones. Our orders are to check people around us... if their mouths match the suspect's words, bring them in. Yes. Chief. If there's real work, I'll do it...otherwise. Not for you. You're not needed. Sorry to say. We've got a list of larceny suspects. Ms. Onda...Ms. Onda... We've matched prints with the other crime scene. Lieutenant, can I borrow her? Hang on. We're busy too. I understand but she can do both. Where's the Inspector? Can't get hold of him. Then why don't you help? I'm up to my neck. We're off. Even though you were up all night... It might be an important break. H.Q. can't back you up, so don't overdo it. And remember, keep expenses down. Got that? Let's go. Do you really understand? If you're that worried about it... "Dreamland” Everyone is standing by. We're thirty minutes away. Rescuing the Commissioner is our priority. Keep watch for suspects. This is not a practice. I repeat, this is not a practice. Are there always this many people? You've deployed too many officers. H.Q. suggested at least three hundred. But it was Muroi's decision. Here's the deluxe sundae. How'd you know it was for me? You'd have thought it was his. Sorry about this. Thank you very much. It's not a hearing aid. Chief, get with the program. This is great. You were telling us to cut expenses. But it looked so good. That's so selfish. Which one is he? Said he'd bring a laptop. Everyone looks shifty. Five minutes away. Officer at the phone. Settle down...eyes on the phone-box. Is that him? I don't know. Get rid of those students. Let's wait and see. But what if he calls? Muroi... Grab the students... Question them. Muroi...you're too slow. "Teddy has joined the chat." It's her. So it's not a man. What's she doing? She's going online. Why not just talk to her? "Snow has joined the chat." "Teddy: We finally meet." "Snow: I thought you were a man." Eight minutes past noon. Any suspects around? He must be watching. He's figured it out... There are too many officers. Shouldn't we pull some out? Muroi, back off. Wait, please. Muroi! Leave it to me. We can't afford to. It's the Commissioner. Officers, pull back. Don't. I'll go tell them. Don't move. Remain as you are. Here's the call. "You know Kunio Harada, don't you? " "Teddy: I met him." "Snow: Did you do anything? " "Teddy: How do you know? " Attention all officers. The suspect is calling. Check people on the phone in your area. The suspect is calling. Check all mobile phones and phone booths. Hello? Is that the daughter? Yes. I've got the money. The police are with you. No. I haven't told them. I don't believe you. Yukino. I'll be back in touch. Hello...hello? Are you okay? She's near. Get after her. Okay. Are you alright? Check out the computer. "How is your stomach?" It was a mobile but we couldn't get a trace. Pull in passers-by for questioning. All of them. Mission failed. The deployment was all wrong. If anything's happened to the Commissioner ... You'll be held responsible. Muroi. Can we get her ID from her computer? I'll try. It's because of this damn thing, she got away. Kidnap or murder... I can't work on both. About that robbery... Have you ever seen him? He was seen lurking about in the Midtown precinct. Don't bother me with that now. We nearly caught that psycho bitch. I'm too busy. This case is important too. Ours happens to be murder. They're all crimes. Okay, I'll look at it later. "Letter of Resignation” Should you be here? The kidnapper... didn't take the bait, then? I heard it on the radio. So you're a deputy superintendent now? One of the elite, congratulations. Hard work...but then so is what we do. At the bottom of the heap. I'm being mean. For now. I'm sorry. I've got this far but our promise... I wanted to give the investigation to the local team, but couldn't do the right thing. Can't practice what I preach. You can. You of all people. I believe in you. I'll wait for it. Let's stick at it. 'Til we get things our way. I'll invoice H.Q. for the coffee. Always being nagged to cut expenses. I'll get you the whole damn vending machine. What have you found? Listen to the last part. No. I haven't told them. I don't believe you. So what is it? Expand the last line. No. I haven't told them. I don't believe you. Whose voice is that? I don't believe you... It's Aoshima. My voice? How come you're on the tape of the suspect? No idea. He must have been near me at that point. There's no explanation. Where were you? The Queen's Square Cafe So the suspect was there. Tell H.Q. Was anyone on a cell phone? No. Do whatever you need. Make him remember. What a prick. You've definitely seen him. It'll be in your subconscious. We'll give you some help to get it out. There's a thousand faces here. I've got to see them all? And eight other disks... Aoshima. Are you okay? It's nothing. Mashita. Don't let H.Q. know about that psycho woman. Okay. Keep looking please. Right. We know her name and address. Manami Hyuga, single, a former nurse, now unemployed. We can't get her as a murder suspect. But I can get a warrant for assault. Let's go to the judge tomorrow. Okay. You always get involved somehow. Must be my mission in life. Not sure about that. I'm getting a warrant for the larceny suspect. The prints match off his door handle. Sohta Kawarazaki, repeat offender. What are you doing? It's a long story. Stop chatting please. Yeah. Let's get that warrant. I won't remind you about expenses. Okay. I'll check the look-out. Okay. I've finished. Check the ones he marked. I'm taking a nap. Excuse me, Aoshima. Something else? Those gentlemen want you to see another list. Internal Affairs. Internal Affairs? Where are we going? Why are you in the dark? My face mustn't be seen. Why not? You're all under my investigation. The suspect is an insider. Hence the questioning in different rooms. Please sit down. Make it quick. I haven't slept for two days. Check over our material. Some of it overlaps. Couldn't you work together? We don't share our information. You know everyone hates you lot. So? This isn't high school. Okay...I'll do it. Don't you think... it's a bit hot in here? There's a call to his house. Hello. Are you with my father? I brought the money. Why didn't you come? Is my father safe? Let me hear him. There's a cop near the house. That's impossible. Is my father there? It's over. Hello. Don't hang up. Wait. He's gone. We couldn't trace it. What's someone doing there? Surveillance team. Surveillance here. Is there anyone near the house? Some weird, old guy. What the hell are you doing? Leave me alone. Calm down please. What the fuck were you doing? How long have you been hanging around there? I couldn't help it. Why did you do it? The Commissioner and I go way back. We met when we were just your age. "Morning. We're watching his house but... it could take ages. Are you okay? I'm beat. Has anyone seen my bag? Where are my receipts? Are they gone? Put the photos away. Ahh...I'm cut. Aoshima. Everyone back. Drop the gun. This is a police station. Why don't you come for me? We were looking. This is the end. You're all so useless. So you're turning yourself in? I came for my computer. Computer? And I haven't finished your treatment. You want it, don't you? Like that guy wanted his operation. He said he wanted something to eat. Take me to the chair. You do have one here? No, we don't. We only do arrests. Don't fuck with me, you bastard! Give it here! Don't let her kill herself! Hey. You're a brave guy. Aoshima. Don't let go of him. Are you taking our picture? It's you? Wandering about here in that uniform? Bought it mail-order. I even got a plastic gun! Isn't anyone for real? Fire department. Pilot. Bunny girl...the wig too. Sushi chef. My noodles. Here's my bag... Work fatigues. Courier. Dressing up and sneaking in is your thing. Pretty clever, huh? If you look the part, nobody doubts you're not a cop. This place was easiest of all. Where are the receipts? Receipts? No point in stealing those? You didn't pinch them? It's divisional command. Muroi here. Chiefs of Staff have ordered an open investigation. I'll organize full deployment. Commander? Am I to step down? No, you're not. You will be held responsible until the end. On the 4th of this month, there was a call about the capture... of Commissioner Yoshida from outside his house. An operations room was set up in the Bayside precinct to investigate this kidnap for profit. Out of concern for the Commissioner's safety, we have not revealed this information. However with no progress being made, and fearing the worst, we are going public. We appeal for your full cooperation. Please report any information, no matter how slight, to your local police station. Everyone present? Yes sir. Prepare for a 10:30 briefing of search patterns. Units 2, 3 and 4 to be flight ready. Yes sir. Dismiss. Aoshima... Aoshima, get up, get up! The investigation's public. Wake up, wake up! The kidnap...it's gone public! Get up. Come on, get up! They've gone public. Get up! Come on. Everyone's meeting. Inspector! What've you been doing? I found this strange guy. Give us a hand, we're busy. I'm pretty tired. I was going to hand in my notice. Let's chat about it later... but for now... Hey, Aoshima. Me and the Commissioner, we're old friends. He joined for the career; me for the street. I was your age. There was a murder. Yoshida was in charge. Really? We worked together a lot. And were always fighting. We once made an agreement. I'd stay on the beat, he'd move up the ranks... to make sure things got done the right way. You've got the same promise with Muroi, right? Yes. Don't give it up. It'll come true. No one can predict the future but... For the sake of the victims, keep at it. Stick with your beliefs... Justify people's faith in you. If you know what I mean. Local police, sit at the back. Aoshima, over here! Let's have the suspect profile from forensics. The results of our analysis, point to a male, college graduate, IQ 130 plus... Single and in his early thirties. Born in the North West of Tokyo... he now lives in the center of town. He's quiet and shy, very perceptive... but narrow-minded too. He's not good with women. Internal Affairs? Anyone from Internal Affairs? They won't share their information. Have Internal Affairs check all police suspects themselves. Commander? Is that your wife? What? No. Here's the brief. You're to follow this. As of ten o'clock this morning, this case was public. You will collate public information with the suspect profile. The local bureau... will provide back up... and do traffic checks in the area. That's all. What's Muroi been doing 'til now? Let's go. They haven't found a single clue. 'Cause they've ignored us. Traffic checks. Is that all they'll let us do? That's our tough luck. I'm fed up with all this. Do what you're told. Who the hell are we looking for? Aoshima? Don't ask me! Who else is there? Aoshima? There is someone. Come with me. Where are we going? Trust me, come on. Sorry about this, Takahashi. You'll get me in trouble. You'll get a date. With her. She's expecting it. I'm counting on you. Thanks. Knock, knock. Hello. Have you lost your mind? Trust me. Would you chat with us? What are you up to? Help us. That woman's web-site is amazing. All these virtual murders and kidnappings. So that's how he was kidnapped. We're focussing on the suspect profile. What do you think? Do you have any comments? What the hell are you doing? Stop this! She researches crimes worldwide. She knows more than us. But... Don't you? You're all so ignorant. Wanna try saying that again? You're absolutely right. How about giving us poor idiots a hand? Don't think about the cause of the crime. Okay. People don't cause crimes. Crimes cause people. Right... The world has changed. Profiles are a thing of the past. Absolutely. You're blindly searching for motives, background and reason. We'll reconsider. Charging ahead with the profile, going further into the fog. You're right. Let me hear his voice. Sure. "There's a cop near his house." "That's impossible. Is my father there? " "It's over." "Hello." That's it. Get anything out of that? Can't you lose your preconceptions? I'll work on it. You still don't understand? 'Fraid not. Got it. At least I think so. If I listen without thinking. It's just a kid. Correct. You were complicating the matter. This is the voice of a stupid, clueless child. A child? It's me. Get Aoshima, it's urgent. For fuck's sake. We were just fooling around. Why do you take it so seriously? Let's go. Chat room friends? What? Friends of that woman... were chatting online about a kidnap. Swapping ideas about kidnapping a company chairman. Do you know their names? Working on it. It'll be a minute. I knew I could count on you. Thanks. What's going on? It's Mashita... The Inspector called for you. He got cut off. I wonder what happened? I'm sending you a list of the members. Here it comes. That many? Like she said... let's filter out the juveniles. "Searching."” "One item found." His address? I don't know it. I'll check the database. Where? Where the hell are you? Sorry...sorry. Just like that Kurosawa film... Aoshima has come up with a strong lead. Aoshima? How reliable is that? No room for another mistake. Nineteen years old? A juvenile. But there's no proof, is there? Tell him to wait for orders. Muroi. Don't let the local police confuse you. Let's start it all again. Gather all department heads. There's no time for that! We're nearly there! Inspector! - Inspector. - Are you okay? Will my insurance cover this? You found the suspect? Building number two. I'm fine. Get after him! Sumire, look after him. Got it. Aoshima! Yeah. Be careful when... you make the arrest. "Sakashita" It's Aoshima. I know where he lives. Shall I proceed? One thing... What? It didn't seem important but... the Commissioner's son told some boys at school... that his father is a company president. He did? How old is he? Nineteen. Aoshima! Wait! Shouldn't we send my team? No, it's a job for our section. Whatever, but it's not for the local crew. Muroi, order me. I'll only listen to you. You will wait there! Wait for our team to arrive! Muroi? He doesn't have command. Stay out of it! Muroi, answer me! I've been seen by the suspect. I'm in pursuit! Don't move. Wait for the main team! This isn't a meeting room... This is the real world! Muroi! Aoshima, arrest him! Muroi, not the local police! Muroi, answer me! Where are you going? Back to the real world. Get the Chief's car ready! Have all emergency vehicles standing by! Get the address. Contact all local precincts and sub-stations... for back-up and traffic control. Aoshima! The Inspector? He's in the car, he's okay. Apartment 1011. Aoshima, Bayside police. May I help you? Is your son in? Is there anything wrong? His friends are here too? I hardly see him. I don't know. Excuse me. Hey, wait! Where's your son's room? I'm not allowed in it. It's here. Don't! Please stop! You're Hajime Sakashita? You know why we're here? Game over. We lost. Where's the Commissioner? He was a commissioner? Where is he? Behind the building. It's Aoshima. Search behind the apartments. You're coming to the station. I don't mind. Are you going to slap my wrists? Aoshima. Let's take him. Wait a sec. Aoshima. If we arrest him, Muroi will be in trouble. What're you talking about? Hajime, run away! I don't want you in the papers! Get up, Hajime, get up! Hurry. Hurry. Aoshima! Stay where you are! Get him to hospital! Please arrest the suspect. Don't please... It must be a mistake. Stop. He's a good boy. Don't take him. Suspect apprehended. The Commissioner? The Commissioner is behind the apartments. He's safe. The Commissioner is unharmed. One officer hurt. Aoshima has... been critically wounded. Commander, did you hear that? Sir? Troops sacrificed in the name of duty. Aoshima... Hold on...Aoshima. Muroi... You don't have to talk. Even when I'm gone... think of the officer on the street. I promise. Hold on... Aoshima. We never had that date... When I get my next day off... Okay...take it easy. Tell the Inspector... thanks... for everything. Don't talk. Hold on! No! Aoshima. Aoshima. Aoshima. I thought he was dead. Three days without sleep... What the... Jesus H. Christ. Today at 3:40pm we arrested the suspects... in the Commissioner Yoshida kidnap case. Three nineteen year old boys from Minato-ward... a businessman and a student have been detained. They planned the kidnap over the internet... thinking the victim was as a company president. The victim was rescued after a suspect confessed. The Commissioner is unharmed. I'm happy to see you well. Is officer Aoshima okay? Quite well, thank you. We take full responsibility. Please leave the local work to us. Sumire...Sumire Have you done that burglary report? I'm working on it. Would you do Aoshima's report on the kidnapping? H.Q. is telling me to hurry up. Why me? "Cause he's in hospital... and we don't know when he'll be back. It'll be soon. Anyway, please do it. It was a nasty wound. He'll get better. He's got to... We'd be stuck without him. You're right. For sure. It'll take a little longer... Why do you say that? Just when we're feeling good. "Letter of Resignation” Back to work. Got that? Well done everybody. Well done. Aoshima got himself stabbed. Look after yourselves. You can't tell what might happen. Akiyama, we're going. I said, we're going Akiyama. Akiyama, I said you can't tell what might happen. Look around you...Akiyama. What are you doing? Throwing away receipts? What are you saying? Receipts! You took Aoshima's receipts! Chief, chief! Calm down. This is your handiwork, isn't it? No idea. This is your handiwork. That's terrible. But... You spend too much. What's going on? I'm arresting a larceny suspect. Here you all are! Take a look at these. What's happening? We're police; we shouldn't steal. Take him for questioning. Call investigations. Clear off. Yes sir. There's nothing to worry about. Muroi. Visiting Aoshima? So you've been demoted for disobedience? You'd gotten so far. You didn't have to do that. Aoshima, what're you doing? I'm sorry. I've got to get back to work. They're in trouble without me. You're not into rehabilitation yet. I've got this agreement with my boss. When I say boss...he's really high up. Name's Muroi. Always got a frown on his face. He's on his way up. But I'm going to look after the street. He's supposed to visit me... But I'd kick his ass and send him back to work. Shouldn't waste time on me... He should hurry on up the ladder. I've done a lot of promising... There's this woman cop, Sumire... If I'm not there, she's always crying. Mashita...I'm always covering for him. Yukino...always asking my protection. Our bosses all piss off home after golf, And leave us to work overtime. Then I've got to put up with the preaching... of a stubborn old git, the Inspector. Talking about them gets me worried. Got to get better and go back. Please don't overdo it. Thank you.
