[music playing] [MUSIC - "SLEEP MY LITTLE SISTER, SLEEP"] Sleep my little sister, sleep. Sleep through darkness, sleep so deep. All the rivers find the sea, my little sister, sleep for me. Dream my little sister, dream. Dream mine here now, dream your dreams-- all the things you want to be. My little sister, dream for me. Somewhere there are meadows. Somewhere there are hills. Somewhere horses run and sheep are still. Sleep my little sister, sleep. Hold my hand and sleep so deep. I will never leave your side. My little sister, close your eyes. [bell tolls] [piano playing] [footsteps] [bell ringing] [door opens] God! Lea! Lea! How did you do it? How did you-- Sh! Later. [door slams shut] [clock ticking] Very good. 150 francs a month, Sundays free until 4:00. I don't believe it! How did you do it? How did you get maman to agree? I told her there'd be more money for her this way. You're so clever. You're so smart! I said that till you learned, you had to have someone to protect you. That was you! That was you! Christine! The room is cold. So, my dear, what do you think? About what, maman? What do you mean about what, maman? About her! About what else? Don't you at least express an opinion, Isabelle? You know how I value your opinion. Yes, maman. I know. LEA: Remember what you used to call me? My feet still get cold at night. They get like ice. You still have this old thing? I don't care. It has nothing to do with me. Don't you like it? I never liked maman's sewing. It's vulgar. Christine, what's the matter? I'll throw it away if you want. I don't care about it. I'm just happy to be with you. I'm happy too, little cold feet. We're together now. That's all that matters. We'll put the blanket right here. Sisters. And two for almost the price of one! We'll save on everything. They didn't even want two rooms! Just this last little corner. Nothing like a convent girl-- such embroidery, such needle work. So, and that's all they ever teach them? You won't even have to go to the dressmakers. What luck. Look at that pink. It brightens up the room! [bell ringing] CHRISTINE: She liked it. Did you see? LEA: She likes everything you do. CHRISTINE: She sees everything. This veal looks delicious! Of course, you love veal. Don't you? You know I don't. It's too heavy in the middle of the day. Besides, I've heard it ruins the complexion. Where did you hear that? I read it. Isabelle, if you continue in this vein, you're going to ruin my meal. Oh! Oh. Wait till the Blanchards come to dinner-- the best cook we've had in years. Mm! You've no idea how lucky we are, Isabelle. The servants I've known in my day! (WHISPERING) The older one fascinates me. I've never had anyone like her-- totally trustworthy! ISABELLE: I like the younger one. She's almost pretty. MADAME DANZARD: I mean, she's quiet. And I'll say that for her. ISABELLE: Quiet? She never speaks. Neither of them do. Well, I suppose they must talk between themselves. I can't imagine about what. Well, maybe they pray. [bell rings] That's how it is when you're brought up by the knights. [laughter] Now stop that, Isabelle! Look at your plate. [tsk tsk] [footsteps] They're so discreet-- not the slightest prying. I don't know what it's like to have a prying maid-- perhaps someone going through your things. When your father and I-- God rest his soul-- were first married-- oh! She was something that one. Now these two are different. You mark my words. [door closes] We're so lucky, Lea. The other houses I've been, they come into the kitchen and interfere. Madame knows her place. Madame checks everything. I like that. Do you? It scares me the way she checks. Oh, no. I like it. It's better that way. Madame is so precise, so careful. But she doesn't let us get away with a thing. Why should she? It's her house. You'll see. The whole town will envy us. We have Poles on our hands, Isabelle-- two Poles! [music playing] [bell tolls] Come on, Lea. [moans] Come on. [moans] [shivers] I polished the banister yesterday. Did you see? I saw. You're disappointed, aren't you? You're sorry I came. Lea, don't be silly. Maybe this was a mistake. I'd slow you down. Stop it, Lea. You're so quick. Sister Veronica said I'd never be as quick as you. Sister Veronica-- what did she know? When you were at St. Mary's, you thought she knew everything. That was a long time ago. I've got over all that now. When I was at St. Mary's I was so scared, I could never go down the stairs like the others. I could never take a step with my left foot. It was always my right, my right, my right. I used envy them running down the stairs when it took me forever. Christine? Tell me a story. - [scoffs] Oh. Just one before we go down. Which one? Um, when I was little. You're still little. No, I mean really little. The one with the horse. Don't you never get tired of it? No. Tell me. [sighs] When you were just a tiny thing, maman sent me out one day to get bread. You came with me the way you always did. And as we were walking, you let go of my hand and ran into the street. Tell it slower. You're telling it too fast. It was a long narrow street. You remember-- on the hill. At the top of a hill, a horse and carriage was galloping down right towards you. I ran into the street. I pulled you across. I pushed you down in the gutter with me-- what a noise when the horse galloped by. And everyone was screaming. And when we stood up, we were both bleeding. But it was the same wound. It started on my arm and went down across your wrist. And look. We have it still. And maman, what did she say? Maman? You know how she gets. She screamed at us. LEA: And then, then what happened? Well then there was the gypsy-- Mad Marguerite they used to call her. - And what did she say? You-- you know it so well. Well, tell me again, Christine. Tell me again. They're bound for life, Mad Marguerite said-- bound in blood. MADAME DANZARD: So what was I saying? [laughter] [music playing] [thunder] MADAME DANZARD: Let me see, Isabelle. Very nice. Very nice. Coming along, bit by bit. You know, you can't rush these things, my dear. Believe me. A bag like that could take-- oh-- two years, maybe more. But there's no hurry, is there? Nothing to hurry for! You've got all the time in the world. [thunder] Listen to that rain! Ugh. It's been raining like that for a week. It could go on for a month. That's all we need. Are you listening to me, Isabelle? I'm listening, maman. Maybe we'll go out to Paris this year. Maman! Could we? For a little shopping. Maman, when? Although, I didn't know. The things they wear in Paris. And you didn't look well in those clothes, Isabelle. You know you don't. How could you? Even I don't look well in them. Pass me the scissors, would you? They're behind you-- on the table! Oh! What's the matter with you? [bell rings] No! No, no, no, no. [footsteps] Besides, I don't like to leave the house. ISABELLE: Why, maman? What could happen to it? MADAME DANZARD: Well, a lot can happen to your house when you're not there. Paris. Yes. I think we'll just have forgo Paris this year. [bells tolling] You don't have to give it all to maman. It's bad enough that we have to go there every Sunday. But maman needs it. Maman-- Maman! Maman, maman! Always, maman. Christine, what? When I was a little, she hated it when I cried. She got rid of me as soon as she could. I had to work. I had to make money. And she took all of it. She placed me. And each time I got used to it, she moved me on again. Oh, yes, maman, maman, beloved, precious, maman. Come on, Lea. We don't want to keep maman waiting. [playing piano] [sound of metronome] And! [playing piano] [bell ringing] Sh! - Who's that? Sh! Let me listen. Who could it be in this weather? Oh. Post. Anything for me, maman? Look at that! No return address. Who do you think it could be from? Well, it's not a wedding. Maybe a funeral-- whose, I wonder. Another letter from the little shepherds of the mount. Well, they never stop asking for money. Those children must be eating out of golden bowls. ISABELLE: Do you really think it's going to rain straight through the winter? Well, you never can tell. But it looks it, doesn't it? Still, don't complain, Isabelle. At least we don't have to go out. [thunder] What is it, Lea? Another letter from maman? Go on, then. Read it. I'll read it later. Read it now. Read it out loud. Lea, my pet, my little dove, I know I'll see you and Christine on Sunday as usual, but I miss you little Lea. You'll always be little. Oh, maman. Christine, maman is just-- Maman is just what? You can't wear your hair like that anymore, Lea-- like a child-- all that long hair. Next Sunday I'll fix it for you. It'll be better that way-- like Christine's-- it won't fall in the soup. [laughter] Or get Christine to fix for you. But tell her to be gentle. I'm never going back. You can go if you want to. You know I wouldn't go without you. You still care for her. She loves you. Christine, maman loves you too! She's just-- What? Scared of you! Scared of me? You never stick up for me! But that's right, defend her. Take her part like you always do! Don't be angry with me! I'm not angry with you. Your face, it looks angry. What? What's the matter with my face? Nothing! Nothing's the matter with your face. It just-- there's nothing wrong with your face. Your face is beautiful. I'll fix it for you. Just like she says. If we didn't go back, we could spend all our Sundays together just to ourselves. We could walk. We could go to the station and watch the trains come in. We could sit in the park. But you wouldn't want that, would you? You want to go back, don't you? Don't you, Lea? There-- like that. That's what she meant. How do you like it? (SCREAMING) How do you like it? (SCREAMING) I hate it! All right, stop it! Please! [sobbing] I hate it! I am a monster, aren't I? Just like she said. You're not a monster. Yeah. Let me-- let me do it. Please. Please. What did you mean when you said my face was beautiful? What I said. What's beautiful about it? Tell me one thing. [music playing] [laughter] This time we're not giving it all to maman. [music playing] Christine, we can never go back! Not you, Lea. Not ever you. She'll never stop loving you. [footsteps] But why shouldn't you keep your own money? Look. She'll forgive you. You'll see. She always has. And Lea, Lea, you know what we'll do with the money? We'll save it. We'll save it all from now on. We'll put it together, yours and mine, and save it. And some day, some day-- look. Remember what I said? From now we'll spend all our Sundays together just the two of us. And Lea, Lea, you can decide. Whatever you want, we'll do. Promise? Promise. Hold this. Pull. Pull! Pull! Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull! [laughter] [panting] That's enough. We have to go down. But it's not time yet. Don't you want to play anymore? [bells tolling] What do you think of mine? Amazing. Well, together, I must say, we make quite a pair. [bell ringing] Come along. They're here. They're here. Come along, Isabelle. Hurry up. The door. Look at this hem. I'll never sew like you. All those years with the sisters and I never learned. The sisters didn't know how to teach you. Remember when I used to visit you at the convent and you waited by the gate? You were so little and so hungry all the time. [laughter] You're still hungry all the time. Christine. Hm? Can I-- Can you what? Can I look at the lace? Of course you can-- all yours. No one sews like you. It's almost finished. Try it on. Don't you want to? Yes, I want to. I'll close my eyes. I want to be surprised. Christine? You can look now. It's beautiful. It's you who are beautiful. I'm cold. I know. [praying] [bell ringing] [playing piano] [humming] [bang] [screams] (SCREAMING) Christine! Christine! [metronome] [hyperventilating] Look. Lea. Look at me. It's not even dented. Look, don't be frightened. Nothing is broken. Look at me. (WHISPERING) My angel. [music playing] Ah. And now-- Hurry! [clapping] [laughter] [singing] PHOTOGRAPHER: This will make a lovely photograph. You're sisters, aren't you? Yes. [sound of flash] PHOTOGRAPHER: I knew right away. Did your mother always dress you like that? Like what? PHOTOGRAPHER: Twins. We're not twins. I'm five years older than my sister. PHOTOGRAPHER: Five years? How about your sister? Cat got her tongue? She's shy. PHOTOGRAPHER: Well, I always wanted a sister-- shy or not. A sister sticks by you, even when you're in trouble. Such a shy thing. I bet you're your mother's favorite. No. PHOTOGRAPHER: What a sweet smile. Still a child, isn't she? Please, now, both of you smile and look at me. Splendid. That'll be fine. No one would ever know the two of you were servants. The Danzards, aren't you? Yes. PHOTOGRAPHER: I hear the daughter's going to be married soon. Of course, I've been hearing that for years. [laughter] You two certainly are discreet. Come on, Lea. Don't be slow. PHOTOGRAPHER: Madame Danzard makes you work hard enough, I imagine-- for the money she pays you? 50 francs, didn't you say? PHOTOGRAPHER: For you girls, I'll make it 25. CHRISTINE: 50 is what you said, 50 is what we pay. PHOTOGRAPHER: I see. Very well. CHRISTINE: Hurry, Lea. Thank you. 1, 2, 3 start. You have nothing to start with. Oh! Why didn't I see that 7? Wait a minute, now. Just a moment. And what's happening over there? That 6 is still sitting there-- and the 9! Go ahead. - What 9? The 9 of diamonds under the 10 of clubs! What's the matter with you? Maman! Please, I can't concentrate! What are you talking about? Of course you can concentrate. This is a game of concentration. You have to concentrate. You have to concentrate on every little detail, otherwise all will be lost! Ha, ha, ha. Ha! That's perfect! Where is that ace? Where is that ace of diamonds? I've got the ace of spades, and the 2, and the 3! Oh, Isabelle, how could you? Locked again is incredible. They'll be down in a minute. Have you noticed? They don't speak anymore. The older one walks by me as if I'm not there. The older one was always that way. Every Sunday up in that room. It's amazing. They've always kept to themselves. They haven't seen their mother in months. That's just as well. 9, 10, jack! [laughter] What's wrong with her? She's put too much salt in these again! Have they forgotten the Flantons are coming? Do you know what they did yesterday? When I was coming back from the Lupans I saw them sitting in the park-- at 11 o'clock in the morning! Unbelievable. 11 o'clock in the morning! I mean, I didn't say anything, but they knew. Ugh. Yes or no? Take a chance, maman. Go ahead. Oh, it's hearts! It's just what I was waiting for. Ace, 2, 3. [moaning] And 5, oh! 6, 7, 8! 8, oh! Ha! Ah! 7! [shrieking] Oh! [clapping] [laughter] [sound of water dripping] [music playing] [banging] [water boiling] [sound of water dripping] Christine? Maman! Do you see? Of course, I see. Do you think I'm blind? What on earth allows her to think she can wear a garment like that in this house? I can't believe my eyes. A cardigan like that must have cost-- I wonder if I pay them too much. You told me I could wear it. When I gave it to you, I never told you you could wear it downstairs, did I? What were you thinking? Why would you want to wear that sweater anywhere but in our own room? I was only thinking of us. Or lying! If have eyes. I can see. When you polish the stairs, you're looking off into nowhere. When you sew, you prick your fingers. When you wax the floor, you get wax on your shoes. You drop plates. You chip cups. You burn yourself with the iron. I dropped that plate six weeks ago. What about the cup? The cup was chipped when we came here. I do things. I get things done! But you keep yourself perfect, don't you? Your collar just right in front, your cuffs folded just so. And why? Do you do everything for her? [sobs] She'll take you with her when she goes. I've always dressed this way. Look at me! You're different, believe me. I know. Now, I see. Hand made. [gasps] That wool! You didn't think it was from Dupan's, do you? Such an extravagance! Imagine if someone had seen! Maman. You go too far. Oh, do I? [moaning] Do I, my dear? You don't know this town like I do. [moaning] [heavy breathing] You think I go too far. Oh, no, my dear. You haven't lived here nearly long enough. What did I tell you? Perfect. You really should trust me, Isabelle. Have I ever chosen anything you didn't like? Eventually? It looks better at home. Of course it does. Everything always looks better at home. I can't wait to see a certain someone's face when you walk-- oh, put your arm down, Isabelle. Remember how long she took last time? What about my iron? It's the second time since October it's had to be repaired. Well, it's another five francs out of her pay this month. Incredible how long it takes to do a simple hem. You know, my dear, I really think this is too tight around the chest. You can't wear these things too tight. They're for your wedding dress, of course. Now how am I going to take you to the Flantons with a crooked hem? The neck needs to be lower, definitely lower. This is impossible! Really-- with crepe at seven francs a meter! Next time we'll go to the dressmakers! There was nothing wrong with that hem-- nothing! You saw it. That hem was perfectly straight. Wasn't it? Wasn't it? Of course it was. She sees things, things that aren't even there-- her and her daughter. You won't go. Will you? Go? Where would I go? Even if she goes, you won't go. Lea, you're thinking about it all the time, aren't you? It's why you're always dreaming, always off in that other world! There is no other world. Christine, don't be upset! You heard madame. You heard what she said. - What did she say? - You heard her! Don't pretend like you didn't! I didn't hear anything! What? Nothing about her daughter? Mademoiselle Isabelle, you mean? (YELLING) Who else? Christine, don't be like that! You sound just like maman. You smiled at her. I saw you. I didn't smile. Promise me that you won't go when she goes. If she goes-- she may never leave, Christine. She may never get married! Just answer me. - Christine. - (SCREAMING) Answer me! Don't just keep saying Christine! You're all I have left. You're all I'll ever have. Sometimes I think I'll never have enough time. Sometimes every morning I imagine things that you-- oh, Lea, there'll never be enough time for us. Come sit with me. [sobbing] I tried to talk to her. Who? Sister Veronica. I waited for her after morning mass. I waited for her. But she wouldn't. [sobbing] She wouldn't talk to me! Her shoes, her shoes kept clicking on the stone. [sobbing] But she wouldn't stop! She wouldn't turn around. She never turned around. [sobbing] You never told me. Christine. Yes? Let's pretend I'm her. Close your eyes. You can look now. MADAME DANZARD: Did you see them coming back from church in their white gloves? And those hats? They don't even look like maids anymore. But they're losing their looks, my dear. Have you noticed how thin they've become? ISABELLE: Especially the younger one. And those circles under the eyes. It's as if they never sleep. Look at this, maman. What? There. Right there-- don't you see? They're getting careless. [moaning] Lea. Lea? Someone-- [hyperventilating] Someone behind me-- pulling me-- pulling. Before-- before I turn around, I know. [panting] And I can, even in my mind-- I can-- I can feel all her little bones. Sh. Try and sleep. Go to sleep. She snatches me into the house and-- I run from corner to corner. But she get's everywhere first. Sh. [hyperventilating] [humming] (SINGING) My little sister, sleep. Dream on here now, dream your dreams. All the things you want to be-- You won't never leave me, will you, Christine? [singing] You won't, will you? No, no. (SINGING) Dream my little sister, dream. Dream mine here now, dream your dreams. LEA: I don't think I could bear it alone through this house. CHRISTINE: (SINGING) All the things you want to be-- my little sister, dream for me. LEA: Do you hear me? I'm so scared. When we came back from the park madame was waiting for us. Weren't you scared? CHRISTINE: Madame never speaks to us anymore. She hasn't said a word in weeks. LEA: She never did. Christine, she never did. CHRISTINE: (SINGING) Somewhere there are meadows. Somewhere there are hills. Somewhere horses run and sheep are still. Sleep my little sister, sleep. Sleep through darkness, sleep so deep. All the rivers find the sea, my little sister, sleep for me. [sound of water dripping] [sound of glass falling] [popping sound] LEA: (SCREAMING) Christine! [sound of glass crashing] [footsteps] Christine! What is it? What happened? The iron-- I was in the middle of the satin blouse-- Did you burn it? What will madame do? What will she do to us? How can madame be angry? It's not your fault. Let me see the blouse. Let me see it. Is it all right? Is it? Is it? Don't worry. Are you sure? It's all right. What will happen now, Christine? What will happen now? Nothing will happen-- just have to wait. [sound of dripping water] How much money do we have saved? Not enough. I know it's not enough. But it will be one day, won't it? Won't it? Sh. Rest now. And then-- and then we'll go away from here. And-- and-- CHRISTINE: Yes. Yes, my Lea. Someday. [crying] I burnt it, didn't I? [sobbing] Tell me. Tell me. My angel. My love. It's all right. Sh. [sound of water dripping] [sound of clock ticking] Where are they? How should I know? Don't answer me like that! Go and find them! Do you hear me? This is absurd! She should be here to take these packages! She should have been here to open the door! 5 o'clock in the afternoon-- what time is it anyway? A quarter past 5:00. A quarter past 5:00. I mean, really! A quarter past 5:00 and not a sign of them! I never heard anything like it! Go and look in the kitchen! They must be in there. Lea! Listen! Well, what took you so long? It's them. Oh, no. They're not there, maman. And-- - Impossible. I'll go. They must be there. And what? There's a glass in the sink-- broken. Broken. Nerve. What on earth can they be doing? Maybe they'll go away. [footsteps] Sh! Listen! What do we do, Christine? What will we do? Leah. Maybe they're upstairs. I'm going up there at once. I have to go down. Wait. Maman! Wait! - Wait? What for? I don't think you should. Do you want them to come up here? This is my house! Of course I'm going upstairs at once! You don't have to come if you don't want to. If I don't go down, they'll come up. I'm frightened! Christine, I'm frightened! Don't leave me! What's this? The lights are off up here. Oh, this is really something. [footsteps] [gasps] Madame. Madame has come back. What is this? How dare you expect me to come back to a dark house! It was the iron, madame. It blew the fuse. Again? Unbelievable. That iron was just repaired. What about my satin blouse? Your sister didn't burn it, did she? She didn't burn my blouse? Mademoiselle's blouse isn't finished yet. Not finished? She's wearing it to the Blanchards! I came back to change into it! And why weren't you downstairs? Where's your apron? I finished early, madame. Don't lie to me. I won't have a liar in my house. The town knows I don't lie. She is lying. I can tell. You disappoint me. Send your sister down with my daughter's blouse at once. Madame can't see my sister now. What? Just listen-- how she speaks to you! MADAME DANZARD: I will see your sister this instant, and she will explain how she came to ruin my iron! I already explained, madame, about the iron. You call that an explanation? CHRISTINE: It wasn't our fault. No? Then whose fault was it? Did you hear that? I heard. Who knows what else they've been doing. If madame doesn't trust us, if she thinks-- we'll leave this house. Leave? And just where do you think you'll go? We'll find another house. Will you? Not after what I've seen tonight. Madame has seen nothing! Nothing? Nothing? That hair, that face-- you smell of it my dear. Oh, madame, don't-- please. Not another word out of your mouth. Breaking my iron-- my house in darkness! I already told madame-- it wasn't our fault! Going to church every Sunday thinking you were a child of God? Madame, you have no right! No right? You must be mad! ISABELLE: She is mad. Just look at her! It's you who have no right, Christine! Just look at that sister of yours. You'll never work with her again. God forgive me for what I have harbored here. You dirt! Scum! Scum sisters! My sister. Not my sister! ISABELLE: (SCREAMING) Maman! (SCREAMING) Not my sister! [screams] Maman! [screaming] [grunting] [stabbing] MAN (VOICEOVER): The bodies of Madame and Mademoiselle Danzard were found in the hallway. On the floor were fragments of bone and teeth, a diamond earring, hair pins, a handbag, a set of keys, a package of meat. The walls and doors were covered with splashes of blood reaching a height of two meters. Madame Danzard's body lay face up-- Mademoiselle Danzard's body face down, the coat pulled up, the skirt pulled up, the undergarments pulled down, revealing deep wounds on the buttocks and multiple slashes on the calves. On the last step of the staircase, a single eye was found intact, complete with the optic nerve. The eye had been torn out without the aid of an instrument. [banging] What did you have against Madame and Mademoiselle Danzard? Was Madame good to you? Did anything abnormal happen between you and your sister? You understand me, don't you? Was it simply sisterly love? Speak. You are here to defend yourselves. You will be judged. [sound of slamming] CHRISTINE: Lea-- I want Lea. [sobbing] I beg you! Give me my sister! Give me Lea! (SCREAMING) Lea! [MUSIC PLAYING - "SLEEP MY LITTLE SISTER, SLEEP"]
