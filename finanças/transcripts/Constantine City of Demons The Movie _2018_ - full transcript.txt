(SCREAMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) How you doing, mate? Treating you good, are they? Spoke to Dr. Hunter. He thinks you're making some progress. Before you know it, we'll be back on the road with the band. Of course, we'll have to find replacements for Alan and Steve. God bless the poor bastards. But all in good time, right? - Brought you something. - (SMOKE WHOOSHING) Not the esoteric stuff you usually go for. Beats staring out the window, right? I mean, you... Johnny. Johnny, what are you doing? You swore you were gonna stop. No more magic, right? No more magic! (CRYING) have to. I... I have to. I have to. I can't let it happen again, Chas. (SOBBING) I can't let it happen again. I can't let it happen again! Some help in here! I can't let it happen... (GROANING) Hey, easy on him. Jesus! (CONSTANTINE BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTING) I can't... Can't... Let it happen... (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) WOMAN: You had an affair and now she's pregnant? (CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE) MAN: That's great news. I'm so happy for you. (CONVERSATIONS STOP) WOMAN: Queen of Angels. (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) (GASPING) Last time I ever drink like that. (SCOFFING) Yeah, right. Tell us another one, John. - (GROWLING) - Jesus! I must be still dreaming. (GROANING) Nope, definitely not dreaming. (GRUNTING) What are you? We're you, Johnny. Like hell you are. "Materialized psychisms," Jung called us. Projections from the unconscious. Your own inner demons given physical form. Oh, that's not good. And the only way I'm going to stop you nasty little buggers is to take you back! (CASTING SPELL) (ALL SCREECHING) (SIGHS) (YELLING) (PANTING) Something opened a door between my conscious and unconscious mind and let them out. That's never happened before. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Christ. We don't want any! CHAS: Open the bloody door, John. Chas? Maybe this isn't a good time. It's never a good time, mate. You look like shit. Oh, thanks, mate. And how have you been this past, what is it? Nine years, 10? Since you spewed up all over Renee's aunty at the wedding. She took it well, I thought. The aunty, not Renee. So, you two lived happily ever after, eh? Not exactly. We've been separated for seven months. Who'd you shag then, knob-head? Nobody. If it was as simple as that, - maybe we could've... - Could've what? (SIGHING) I don't know. We were happy, we really were. In the past few years, I've been in a kind of dark place. Pushing Renee away. Drinking myself sick. I, uh... You... What? I thought I was past it, John. After all this time. (SCREAMING) I thought I was past it. Why are you here, Chas? It's not for marital advice, and it's not 'cause you've missed me all these years, that's for sure. Maybe I have. You were my best mate, John. Since we were 10 years old. Why are you here? Since Renee kicked me out, it's like my whole world's gone dark. Only decent thing I've been able to hold on to is my little girl. You have a kid? (CHUCKLING) She's eight years old. I sent you a bloody announcement when she was born. Must have missed that one. Trish is... She's the only light in my world. The only hope... And, uh... What? She's in a coma. Doctors haven't a clue what caused it or how to cure it. But I've spent enough time around you to smell the stink of dark magic. It's convenient to pin our troubles on some devil lurking in the shadows, Chas. But sometimes, shitty things happen because that's just the way the world is. CHAS: Just come have a look at her. That's all I'm asking. CONSTANTINE: Saving kids isn't something I'm very good at, as you know better than most. But it's different this time, John. It's my daughter. My daughter. All the more reason not to bring me into it. No, no. - I won't have him here. - He can help. Help? He's a disease that infects everything around him. And I won't have him infecting my girl. Chuffed to see you too, Renee. How long do you need? Five minutes. Alone. Five minutes, Renee. These bloody doctors can't do anything, maybe he can. Five minutes. (MACHINES BEEPING) Not a second more. (GROANS) (SCREAMING) (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) Hello, Trish. I'm John. Mind if I have a look at your aura? Tainted... By what? Let's have a look inside. Jeez! Bloody hell! (SPEAKING DEMON LANGUAGE) Chas, Renee, I'm gonna need a little more than five minutes. Why? What are you up to, John? I'm calling in a specialist. John, John! John! (CHANTING SPELL) Ugh, your timing sucks, Johnny. I was right in the middle of a threesome with a dryad and a sylph. Both of whom, I might add, are better in the sack than you ever were. Hey, you were nothing to write home to my mum about either, love. (SCOFFS) We both know that's not true. Now what do you want from the Nightmare Nurse? Well, I did swear an oath to preserve life, do no harm, and all that other crap. So, what do you think? I think you should shut up and let me do my job. It's possession, right? What part of shut up don't you understand? It's not possession because there's nothing here to possess. What? Her physical form is here but her essence, her soul... It's gone. Well, someone was there a minute ago. Let's find out who. (GROANS) (AS TRISH) Help me! Trish, Trish, where are you? In a... In a cage, I think. It's hard to see. And it's so cold. Are you alone? All alone. Except when he comes. Who, Trish? Who comes? The nasty man. Does he have a name? (GASPING) Trish, does he have a name? (AS DEMON) I have many names. Be careful to choose the right one. Well, then tell me what the name is. Guess. This isn't a bloody game. (CHUCKLING) It is to me. What do you want with the girl? Ooh, so many questions buzzing in your little gnat brain. But if you want answers, John Constantine, you'll have to come by for a visit. Come by? Come by where? (SCREAMING) CHAS: John! John, open the damn door! (ASA PANTING) Asa, are you okay? Give me a second to put my dress on. Son of a bitch! If I was human, I'd be toast now. But I'll get the paperwork written up as soon as I can. What the hell, John? Who's she? A private nurse I've hired to watch over Trish while I'm away. Away? Well, where are you going? Los Angeles, apparently. MAN 1: I'll never leave you, I swear. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN 2: Set a meeting for Tuesday. (CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE) - (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) - (GASPING) That's the same dream I had before all the psychisms came crawling out. Someone's messing with my head. Maybe it's early-onset dementia. (SCOFFING) I should be so lucky. FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON PA: Ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare for landing, please be certain your seat belts are securely fastened. No problem. Beautiful, isn't it? We're not on a sightseeing tour, knob-head. I don't know how I let you talk me into taking you along. It's my natural charm. You can't resist it. She's my kid, John. I have to be part of this. Besides, you need a driver. I can drive myself. Ha! Come off it. Five minutes behind the wheel and you'll be wrapped around a palm tree. - (TURBULENCE) - (WHIMPERS) Oh, good thing I can depend on your nerves of steel. Listen, we're messing with deep, dark magic here, Chas. Deeper than Newcastle? (SCREAMING) Can't change the past, Chas. No. But you can change this. - Even if we can save Trish... - We will. You will. If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that there are no happy endings. There never are. There's always a price to pay. No price is too high when it comes to my little girl. Tell me that after you've paid it, mate. Yeah. You're gonna be a huge help. (RINGING) Come on, knob-head, let's go pay a visit to the bastard who's got your girl. CHAS: You think it's a trap? - John. - What? You think it's a trap? Chas, it's always a bloody trap. RENEE: Are you sure we're the only ones who can see that, whatever it is? The Shield of Ermed will protect Trish's body, anchor it here while John searches out her soul. Lost souls, mystic shields, Demons. This is... Oh, this is crazy. You people go about your lives like sleepwalkers. You have no idea what's out there. The darkness that's hovering on the periphery of your vision. (GROWLING) I know more than you think. Darkness you talk about. It nearly destroyed my husband. He was with John in Newcastle. So, you know the story? Just scraps of it. Johnny boy likes to brag about his exploits. But not that one. (SCOFFING) It was years before Chas finally told me. Tell me. About Newcastle? No. (INHALING) I can't. I just... It wasn't a request. RENEE: They were inseparable, John and Chas, from the time they were kids growing up in Liverpool. Looked after each other. God knows their families couldn't. Opposites, you know? Chas was attracted to John's unpredictability. And John, he was drawn to Chas' soft heart. I think it was the music more than anything that bonded them. - (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) - They were obsessed. Had to learn to play. Had to form a band. They spent years performing in shitholes for a percentage of the door. They always thought they were a day away from fame and fortune. Maybe it would've worked out if they hadn't ended up in Newcastle. The Casanova Club was run by a twisted bastard named Alex Logue. Fancied himself a sorcerer. (SCOFFING) Had what he called "magical convocations" in the rooms under the club. Don't ask me what that means. I don't wanna know. (WHIMPERING) But I do know that Logue used his daughter, Astra, as a focal point for his spells. A human channel to draw the dark magic down into the physical world. (SOBBING) (SCREAMING) His own child. Can you imagine? Oh, it was bad. And then, John Constantine went and made it worse. You see, John was another one who fancied himself a magician. Been studying the occult since he was a boy, claimed he had a natural gift. (ASTRA SOBBING) - Logue had been a mentor to him... - (CHANTING SPELL) ...but when John found out what was happening with the girl, he decided he was gonna save Astra. He could've just called the cops, but that would've been too easy. - (CHANTING SPELL) - And of course Chas, the loyal idiot, was right there with him. And what better way to stop a devil like Alex Logue than by summoning a bigger one. (GROWLING) (GASPS) A real one. (ROARING) That was John's logic. And it worked, up to a point. (YELPING) (GROANING) (NECK SNAPS) - (SLASHING) - (SCREAMING) - (JAWS BITING) - (CHOKING) - (SLICING) - (SCREAMING) (SNARLING) - (ROARING) - (SCREAMING) John thought he could use Nergal to put the fear into Logue and his friends, and get Astra away from them. But he was arrogant even then. Our John didn't know half of what he thought he did. So, he never wove a binding spell around the demon, which means he couldn't control it. - (DEMON SNARLING) - Couldn't stop Nergal... (BOTH GASPING) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) ...from unleashing hell on Earth. (ALL SCREAMING) (NERGAL ROARING) (ALL SCREAMING) Some got out, some didn't, and John... (SIGHING) Well, he learned that night that his natural gift... Wasn't gift enough. (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMING) No! (GASPS) No! (SCREAMING) (YELLING) And that's how John ended up in Ravenscar. (GASPING) And my Chas just soldiered on all those years. No! No! Pretending everything was all right. (SCOFFING) I believed him, too. But once you've been through something like that, it never can be. (RENEE SOBBING) Can it? About Newcastle? No, I can't. We're just... That's all right. If you don't wanna tell me, you don't have to. You could've sprung for something bigger, John. I feel like I'm in a bloody clown car. I didn't see you reaching into your pocket to help. How's that for you? (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Weird. - What? - Don't know. Maybe it's the jet lag or maybe it's this city. I'm used to London. I know her. Down to every alley. Every shadowed corner of her soul. But this place... Too much light. I could use a bit of light right now. Well, you soak it in, mate. Me, I don't trust it. CHAS: This is it. 1247 Enstrom. - You one for anagrams, Chas? - No. Why? Enstrom. Move the letters around, and what have you got? Monster. (CHUCKLES) It's funny, eh? Yeah. I'm in hysterics. (SNORTS) Yes. Clearly the right place. I think we're expected. Enter freely and of your own free will. I've always wanted to say that. (DOOR CLOSING) (FLY BUZZING) - (GRUNTING) - Oi! Master Beroul will be down presently. Please wait right here. - (SQUELCHING) - Ugh. Bollocks! Oi! He said to wait here. Yeah. And that's just what I want you to do. (DOOR CREAKING) (GAGGING) I rather like the smell. Master Beroul, I presume. Beroul will suffice. Oh. The pool's not ready yet. I've got to wait for the bodies to liquefy, dredge out the bones. And then? Use it for my daily swim, of course. Ugh. Lovely. Isn't it, though? A man needs to stay in shape. Uh, you're no bloody man. Something you'd do well to remember, Mr. Constantine. You know me. Your reputation precedes you. (GROANING) Why else would I go to all this trouble to bring you here? Ah, you used Trish as a lure. (SCOFFING) Mr. Chandler is one of the few people on this Earth you care about. I knew you wouldn't refuse your old friend's plea for help. You could've just texted me. And would you have come? (CHUCKLING) A man of your nature, John, requires something more theatrical, hmm? More dangerous. What's this all about? I'll explain everything. At the party. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (BATS SQUEAKING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMS) (LAUGHING) (INAUDIBLE) WOMAN: No! (STRAINING) (LAUGHING) I adore old Hollywood, don't you? Of course, if you don't like the 1920s, something a bit more contemporary, perhaps. (1980s MUSIC PLAYING) You're gonna die. You're gonna die. (PEOPLE GROANING) Dance. Uh... I don't think so. Out in the world, beyond my wards and enchantments, you may be able to resist me. But here, in my house... - Is this Hell? - A hell. My hell. You see, I've been visiting Los Angeles for years. Felt right at home, instantly. After all, everybody in this town sells their soul for a dream. (GRUNTING) People here are so desperate, so enamored of illusion. Oh, yes. They'll very happily debase themselves for the merest whisper of fame. (CHUCKLING) Down there, you know, we've got to wait for the damned to descend, fight among ourselves for the pickings. But up here, mmm? So many souls. It's a cast of thousands, millions. Power-hungry, delusional, egotistical, selfish. All the qualities we look for in candidates for damnation. I had what you Brits would call a brainwave. A branch office of Hell, right here. A franchise operation, like fast food, but with the added benefit of eternal damnation. So many souls just begging to be corrupted and consumed. (CHUCKLES) So much power for a demon to absorb. The sky is the limit for the entrepreneur who gets in first. (MOANING) But I've got competition. Five other Demons with similar aspirations. And I want that competition eliminated. - And that's where I come in. - Precisely. I don't do anything till I see the girl. Which one? Chas' Trish. Ah. (LAUGHING) Nothing my kind savors more than the sweet subtle flavors of an innocent soul. Where is she? Safe, right here. (CHUCKLING) You could say she's a prisoner of love, held, quite literally, within my heart. Let her go, you bastard. Let her go. No, Chas. If what Beroul's saying is true, then any attack on him is an attack on your daughter. But we don't know if it's true, do we? (YELLING) - Chas! - Not to worry. He isn't dead. - (GASPS) - BEROUL: Just displaced. Bloody hell. (BEROUL GRUNTS) Not that the idiot could've hurt me. Now, will you take the job? If I'm working for you, I want a fat salary, - and a swanky hotel. - Done. Now get out. It's time for The Young and the Restless, and I never miss it. CONSTANTINE: Jeez, keep your bloody head on, Chas. I'm coming. What? - (TRUCK HORN HONKING) - Yeah, I'm driving. So what? (BRAKES SCREECHING) (YELLING) Piss off. I said, piss off. (EXCLAIMING IN CONFUSION) Took you long enough. I might've gotten lost a few times. CHAS: So you're working for Beroul now. Are you crazy? Stupid question. He didn't give me much choice. We've gotta play his game if we wanna get Trish back, all right? And what do all the coma victims have to do with this? (GROWLING) The best I can figure, their souls are fueling the engine of Beroul's magic, like batteries, providing the energy for him to open up small doorways between Hell and Earth, so he can set up his bloody franchises and feed on the souls up here. But where does Trish come into it? There are dozens of coma cases here, but in London, there's just... Oh. Go on. Tell me it's all my fault. Maybe it is. Or maybe you can't be responsible for every damn Demon that wants to make trouble in this world. (ALL GROWLING) Only thing I know is I want my little girl, and if anyone can get her back, it's you. Tell that to Astra Logue. (ALL GROWLING) You were a stupid, arrogant kid then. Yeah? And I'm a stupid, arrogant man now. But I'll do the best I can for you, Chas. You've got my word on that. Good. So what's next? Next? We follow Mr. Blobby's orders, kill his enemies and kiss his fat... (DISTANT GROWLING) Shit! (GROWLING) Where'd they come from? Who sent them? One of Beroul's competitors, no doubt, who wants to stop me before I stop them. Well, can't you just, I don't know, magic them away? Who the hell do you think I am? Benedict bloody Cumberbatch? CHAS: Well, do something! (GROWLING) John! (TIRES SCREECHING) Hit the brakes. (BOTH GRUNT) (DEMONS GROWLING) (CHANTING SPELL) Now that's a border wall. Yeah, well, the enchantment's not gonna last. We've got less than a minute before those things start eating our livers. You know, for a guy who lies so much, you tell the truth at the worst bloody times. (CAR HORN HONKING) - Get in. - Really? And I'm supposed to trust you because... Because if you don't, you're gonna die. Now get in the car, John. - Who the hell are you? - A friend. And how do you know my bloody name? Look, maneuvering the vehicle while controlling this body isn't easy for me. - Clearly. - So, shut the hell up and let me concentrate on my driving. (TIRES SCREECHING) What's this? Didn't I tell you? We've moved up in the world. You coming? I'll be in touch. Where the hell am I? You think that was Beroul's work? If he could do that, he wouldn't need me. Then who? CONSTANTINE: Well, whoever it was, they just saved our skins. (SCREECHING) RENEE: What the hell are those things? Spirits from the lower astral plane. They're so hungry for life on Earth, they can't move on to the deeper heavens. What do they want with her? Trish's soul isn't here. So she's a perfect vehicle for them. A way back. No. No! Don't worry. - (BANGING) - (SCREECHING) ASA: They can't get to her. Yet. (SIGHING) What do you mean, "yet"? (EXHALING) The longer her soul's away from her body, the harder it's going to be for me to protect her. Oh, God. I wish Chas was here. You still love him? Once you've shared your life with someone, created a child together, opened your heart so wide, that love never leaves, no matter how much you might want it to. And Trish... Oh, God. She adores that man. (CHUCKLING) Girls and their dads, you know? Actually, I don't. I understand the pleasures of this human flesh well enough. But the kind of love you're talking about, it's a mystery to me. I'm disappointed in you, John. Two days and you haven't made any progress. My enemies are still out there. Well, it's not like you gave me an address. I've had to follow the ley lines, see where they converge in places that will be conducive to your kind. Or are you just marking time while you plot against me? I'm getting close, Beroul. Get closer. The meter's running on the girl, you know. Progressive neuropathy. The sooner you get poor Trish back into her own body, the more of it she'll still be able to use. How do I know that you really have her, eh? Her soul could be anywhere. Oh, I suppose I can give you a little glimpse. Perhaps the motivation will speed you along. (SCREAMS) (CHUCKLING) (YELPING) Shit. (GROANING) Trish? (GASPS) Trish, is that you? Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. (WHIMPERING) Help her! John, there's just so long I can keep her body alive while her soul is... Wherever the hell this is. You don't want to know. You need... BEROUL: Time's up. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) Trish. Trish, I swear I'll get you out. I swear I will get you out! (SOBBING) (VOMITING) (CHUCKLING) Believe me now? - (COUGHING) - Aw, feeling queasy? I thought you had the stomach for this kind of thing, John. Yeah. Piss off. I thought you'd changed since Newcastle. (LAUGHING) Oh, the look on your face when I opened that portal and tossed little Astra in. Even tainted by her father, there was still so much innocence left in her. (CHUCKLING) Delicious. No. Yes. Nergal. But Beroul? Was a convenient mask. I told you back in London that I had many names. I've been keeping tabs on you since Newcastle, John. Watched you claw your way back from the edge of sanity. Watched you master the very dark arts that failed you 15 years ago. You really should thank me. Thank you? After all, I did inspire you to become a better man, didn't I? And now, here we are, reunited after all this time. Bastard. Uh-uh-uh. Wouldn't want to hurt poor Trish. Why are you doing this? Because you've got so much potential, John. And I'd like to help you actualize it. You see, I have minor limitations while I'm in this world. I need a human agent with your skill set who can travel freely, seek out new customers, help build up the business. Think of all we can accomplish together. I do this one thing for you, Nergal. You give me Trish and then you never see me again, you understand? I understand if you need to take some time to think about it. Now, get out of my house. And one more thing. What happened to Astra? She's somewhere in the bowels of Hell, (CHUCKLING) screaming your name. Now, get out and do your damn job. Oh, and, John, if your whore in London tries to get inside me again, it won't end well for her or Trish. I'm getting closer to finding them, Chas. Demons like those five leave a psychic residue like a slug leaves a trail of slime. So just hang in there, all right? No, you don't have to come out. Take the night to yourself. Have a drink and get some... (GRUNTS) In there. What are you looking at? (MUSIC PLAYING) (BELCHING) MAN: Hey, jerkoff. Not your usual, but I hope it will do. Nice to see you again, John. Again? All of it. All of them. Some call me Angela. Others call me... (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) ANGELA: Queen of Angels. You. Coming? Where? Afraid of me, John? Do you think I'm one of them? - A devil from Hell? - Maybe. Come with me and you'll see that I am so much more. (DOOR OPENING) What is this? A history lesson. (ANGELA MOANING) You said you know London, John. Every alley, every shadowed corner of her soul. Now step out into the sun and know me. (BOTH GRUNT) My body is flesh and blood, stone and concrete, tree and earth. My mind is thick with 10 times 10 million memories. Radiant, like the histories of all my people. (BOTH MOANING) You're the collective consciousness of the city. (MOANING) You're Los Angeles. Queen of Angels. (MOANING) From the very beginning, John, men and women have come to me seeking second chances, hoping to remake, rebirth themselves in my light. I'm not perfect, John. There have been times I've failed my people. Failed them badly. But for all my flaws, for all my failures, this is a city of hope. The city of angels. And I won't have those hell things poisoning it. Poisoning me. (ANGELA MOANING) It was you back in London, poking around in my head. Rooting through the darkness of your psyche. Calling out the little monsters that live inside you. - Why? - I had to be sure of you. You see, John, I need your demons to fight these Demons. We all use each other. You know that better than anyone. (CHUCKLING) Shit. (SIGHING) How can you sit there checking your bloody e-mail when my girl's life is on the line? When that bastard Nergal has her. I'm not checking e-mails, knob-head. - I'm doing research. - (GROANING) I haven't got the power to take on Nergal's competitors. I need a weapon to use against them. I don't think you're gonna find that on Amazon. I've been poking around the ethers, pulling down bits of information. - About what? - Not what. Who. Mictlantecuhtli. Ancient Aztec death god. One of the big boys. (ROARING) (YELPING) (ROARING) Aztec empire died out. And Mictlantecuhtli should have died with them. But the faith persisted and Spanish settlers brought him with them to Southern California. New gods rose and fell, but Mictlantecuhtli is a stubborn bastard and he just keeps hanging on. That's... That's not real, is it? I gave up on trying to figure out what's real a long time ago. Not a helpful answer. (GROWLING) (ROARING) And what's this Mict... Mictl... What's this bloody god got to do with my Trish? Let's find out. Lovely. Mictlantecuhtli, god of bones and of the grave mouth and of all that begins when the heart stops, I come to you as a suppliant. I spill my own blood now to show respect. Thank you for letting me into your house. Thank you for hearing... (YELPING) (GROANING) (FLIES BUZZING) MICTLANTECUHTLI: How did you find me? How did you find me? You're not like the others. You're not trying to hide. You want your worshippers to find you. MICTLANTECUHTLI: One day, yes, when I'm strong again. Once I was worshiped by millions, and they sacrificed millions more in my name. Now, to my eternal shame, I am reduced to feeding on the energy of the animals that die every day above my head. But I still have power and I am still a threat to someone like you. What prevents me from feeding on you, John Constantine? Sucking out your meaningless life and feasting on your soul? Don't gobble me up until you've heard my offer. I am listening. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Jesus, John. You're white as a sheet. Are you all right? No, but I'm alive and that's gotta count for something, right? Now, I've got an errand for you to do. - It's important, Chas. - Done. And you? I've got a phone call to make, of sorts. (THUNDER RUMBLING) CHAS: A church, Johnny? - Really? - Unconsecrated. Otherwise, I'd have a hard time setting foot in there. And so would they. (DOOR CREAKING) (YELPS) - Oi, careful. - This shit's heavy. Christ. Who knew there was a black market in Holy Water. Just don't drop it, all right? Don't want you splashing it around till dead-on midnight. And make sure all the windows are locked before you leave. Cover every way out of this place. (GROWLING) What's that bloody smell? Smells like shit. Is this the thing that invited us? Yep. That would be me. Can it make good on its promise? Does it think that this place can protect it if it disappoints us? CONSTANTINE: It's got a name. Have you done as you promised when you summoned us here, John Constantine? Have you delivered Nergal to us? Oh, that. That was a lie. (DEMONS ROARING) You lied to us? And I feel terrible about it. Then what shall save you, little smear of flesh? I was hoping that he would. (BANGING) You promised me a feast, Constantine. And you have delivered. What is this ridiculous thing? You five seek to usurp a land that's rightfully mine. I will stop you. Consume you, body and soul. (ALL LAUGHING) I am more than a match for you. (GRUNTING) (ROARING) (EXCLAIMS) (SCREAMING) Trapped. We are trapped! (ROARING) (BOTH YELPING) I could have never found these five on my own. Never held them here without your magics. We live to serve. Now, what are you waiting for? Finish your dinner. We are not dead yet. Going somewhere? (SCREAMING) They were more worthy adversaries than I expected. Exactly what I was counting on. I can't let you live, Mictlantecuhtli. - You're too bloody dangerous. - We had an agreement. And it's been fulfilled. You got to fatten yourself up. I've got five dead Demons. Not my fault if they took you down with them. Please, Constantine, carry me back to the slaughterhouse, where I can renew myself. - Where... - There's nothing more pathetic than a god who begs. (CHANTING SPELL) Enjoy the rest, old man. God knows, you could use it. CONSTANTINE: It's done, Nergal. All of them wiped out in one fell swoop. Well played, Constantine. Well played. WOMAN: Indeed, John. Very well played. You two, together. Nergal has been visiting me for a long time. We're old, well, friends certainly isn't the word. Reluctant acquaintances. But you told me you wanted them all gone. Five is victory enough. Nergal, I'm afraid, would put up a fight that could destroy my city. And I can't have that. So we've made an arrangement. He stays and runs his little franchise. But limits his activity to an acceptable level. There's no acceptable level where that's concerned. Some will suffer at Nergal's hands. Most will not. - The city will survive. - And you can live with that, can you? We all make compromises, John. And we all have to live with them. But my kid! What about Trish? You have no idea how sorry I am. But one life measured against the lives of millions. Damn it. God damn it. She's still in here. (CHUCKLING) And he's never gonna let her go. (CHAS GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) I was wrong before. This is on you, John Constantine. This is all on you! (YELLS) (GASPING) Huh. I still need you, John. To be my agent out there. Keep the franchise humming. As long as you work for me, the girl will stay alive. In a coma. What kind of life is that? Or... I could just dispatch her to Hell. (CHUCKLING) Astra could use a playmate. You bloody bastard! I'll... (GROANING) That's no way to talk to your employer. Now pull yourself together. We've got lots of work ahead of us. Screwed it up again, didn't you? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Mrs. Chandler. - (GROANING) What? - Mrs. Chandler. - I don't want to hear it. - Renee. I don't wanna hear it. Given your daughter's lack of brain activity, you're only putting yourself through more torture by leaving her on life support. I urge you to consider letting Tricia's body shut down naturally, - and to somehow... - No! (SOBBING) I think you'd better go. I can help you, Renee. (GASPS) - The way Constantine did? - No. I can reduce your pain. Make this decision easier for you. Reduce my pain? (SCOFFING) You're just like him, aren't you? You think you can wave your magic wand and make the world a better place? But all you ever do is make it worse. (SOBBING) Hey. Another one. - Another what? - Another anything, love. You're past your limit, time to go home. Why don't you call yourself a ride? Bugger off. Nobody tells me when I've reached my limit. (VOMITS) (GROANING) Abraca-fucking-dabra. (SCOFFING) Figures. (GRUNTS) Now that's more like it. (SIREN WAILING) (CELL DOOR BUZZING) OFFICER: Constantine, bail's been posted, come on. You tell Nergal I don't want his damn bail. I'm happy right where I am. Don't care. Name was Chandler. You're the last person I expected to see. Then we're even, 'cause this is the last place I expected to be. How'd you know where to find me? I've watched you do this a dozen times over the years. Things go balls up and you're out getting pissed. Picking fights with the wrong people. You got a better idea? Yeah, get up off your lazy ass and save my girl. We lost, Chas. Nergal's gonna hold on to Trish till her body dies and maybe... Maybe after that too. Go home, be with your wife. Beg her to take you back. - Maybe something good can come of this. - No! You're not gonna do to her what you did to Astra bloody Logue. Now come on, we've wasted enough time. Hey, we're not going anywhere. Not till we have a plan. NURSE: Excuse me. Where are you going? Visiting hours were over at... CONSTANTINE: Don't you worry about it, love. Uh, I won't. Wait outside, Chas. Anyone tries to get in, deck 'em. Deck 'em? Believe me, you'll be doing 'em a favor. (CHANTING SPELL) (CREATURE HISSING) (GROWLING) Voodoo chant. How old-fashioned. Got you here, didn't it? You've cut me off from my supply chain. Blocked my access to those slabs of comatose meat. Not very nice. (CHANTING SPELL) What do you want? And let's make this quick. I've got a meeting with a producer. (CHANTING SPELL) Pitching him a fantastic project. A musical, of course. They're all the rage now. Stories about a deluded loser from merry England who comes to la-la land with a head stuffed full of dreams, only to have those dreams devoured by a charming tap-dancing demon. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (GROANING) (CHANTING SPELL) (SCOFFS) You do realize that this is just one room in one hospital? There are hundreds more of those sleeping beauties out there. And you can't cut me off from all of them. CHAS: He's not cutting you off from your supplies, ass hat. He's cutting you off from the wards and protections of that Addams Family mansion you live in. What are you up to? (CHANTING SPELL) (RUMBLING) You opened a few doors between Hell and Los Angeles. Johnny's opening the rest. What? Something your pal Angela said stuck with him. How you'd take the city down if you went to war with her. But John thinks you love LA too much for that. - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - (TIRES SCREECHING) So what's it gonna be, Nergie? Bring an army of Demons up here and let them demolish your personal paradise, claim it for themselves, or you let the girl go. (GROWLING) CONSTANTINE: I could use a little help here. Here's Johnny! (NERGAL GRUNTING) All Constantine, all the time. I really should thank Angela for this. (GRUNTING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) You won't do it. I already have, you chump. You were worried about five competitors, right? Well, how about 500? Or 5,000? - (NERGAL YELPING) - (CONSTANTINE DEMONS SNARLING) (GRUNTING) (GROWLING) All right, damn you, close the doorways. Close them and you can have the girl! (CHANTING SPELL) Now, give me my daughter, you son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you. You wretched bag of misery and beer. And, oh, what I'm going to do to sweet, innocent little Trish... - (GASPING) But you said... - I lied. And so did you. You're a talented lad. But you haven't got the power to open the gates of Hell. Oh, a few temporary cracks here and there. A few dramatic rumbles. But you can't bluff me, John. You were terrified, I saw it. An Oscar-winning performance. Don't you think? Chas, remember what you said about sacrificing anything for Trish? - Yes. - Did you mean it? I'm choking here, Johnny. Did you mean it? Yes! Then God help you. Asa, are you ready? - Renee, get up. - What? Get up now! (CHANTING SPELL) (GROANING) (ASA CHANTING SPELL) What have you done? (GRUNTING) You didn't realize, did ya? That the biggest weapon we had against you was inside of you all along. Now, Asa! (SCREAMING) But I... I don't understand. It's the Camdever curse, Nergal. That's love you feel. Renee and Trish's love for Chas, - and it's all inside the girl. - (GROANING) All inside you. And to a creature like you, that's a cancer, spreading like an LA wildfire through every cell in that repulsive body of yours. Listen, stop this, John. Stop it and I swear to you I'll give her back to you. We've already got her back, you twit. No, not Trish. Astra. The binding pact seared into my own flesh. (SCREAMING) Wait, I'll take you to her. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Set her free. Johnny, no! Redemption, John, after all these years. Bugger off. This is redemption enough. (GROANING) (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) (GROANING) (GROANING) (GASPS) Trish, my baby. You're back. Not bad, Con-man. Not bad at all. She's really all right. Yeah. - Go ahead, blubber. I won't mock ya... - (SNIFFLING) - Too much. - I better call Renee and... What? That spell I used. It was called the Camdever curse. Yeah? So? Accent on the curse, mate. What do you mean? I warned you, didn't I? Magic that powerful requires a sacrifice. Yeah, well, Nergal's a steaming pile of demon shite, - so... - That's not what I mean. In order for the curse to work, I had to channel Renee and Trish's love for you into and through Nergal. Every last bit of it. It's gone, Chas. All their love for you is gone. What? Renee won't have any memory of you now. Oh, she'll recall a drunken one-night stand eight years ago, - but your face, your name... - What? - And Trish? - Trish has never known her father. (GASPS) There's always a price to pay, Chas. And this is it. You had this in your pocket the whole time, didn't you? I did. But I hoped I wouldn't have to use it. You miserable sack of shit! The proper response is "thank you." John! John, what? The Camdever is big magic. And Renee and Trish, no matter how much they loved you, it wasn't enough, Chas. So, I had to throw in some extra juice to put the spell over the top. I had to throw in us. You'll have a vague memory of an arrogant sod who saved your girl and ruined your life. But the memory of those two kids who grew up together in the pool... Gone. Uh, sorry. Your name? - It seems to have just... - Constantine. John Constantine. Yeah? Well, it's a name I hope I never hear again. MAN: I knew you could do it, John. Angela? More or less. You knew I'd beat Nergal. Well, I hoped. Sorry about your friend. Yeah, well, he's better off without me. MAN: Which is worse, I wonder? Being the one who doesn't remember or being the one who does? He needs a new home, John. And I think he'll fit in nicely around here. - You take good care of him. - I will. Ugh! Not really a fan of old and wizened. Thanks for the gesture, though. I'll see you later if you like. In a body that might please you a little more. Mmm, a tempting offer. But no, thanks. I'm getting homesick. And if I'm gonna knock boots with a city, I'd rather it was London, love. So be it. Best of luck, Chas. You're gonna need it. CONSTANTINE DEMON: Oi, oi. Slow down, mate. Bloody hell. One of you actually made it out alive. It wasn't easy, I'll tell you that. Oh, it never is, mate. So, you gonna take me back in? Eventually, but right now, I could use a little company. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
