ONE OR THE OTHER It's better to wait a bit. Thank you. I wonder who will answer. - Whoever is the weakest. You think? I'm going. Kolczyk. Yes... Alright, thank you. The photographer is coming at at half-past twelve. What photographer? They just want some family pictures. That's lovely. And we're learning it just now? - There's enough time. You could have known that I need a hairdresser. Tell your mother she looks fantastic. - You look fantastic, mummy. From you? - For the shoes. Thanks. What's up? - Mail. Mornin' chief! Again no Nobel Price in sight? I'd still like an autograph. In case you get famous after all. Until next time. Mornin'! Want me to open it? I know what's in it anyways. "Dear Mr. Ziegenhals..." - "We have read your script..." "Regrettably it's not possible..." "in the scope of our publishing house" - Assholes! Editors are all assholes! Don't worry. Some day it will work out. Someday even an asshole takes a day off. Eventually all assholes take a day off. Morning. - Morning Professor. Mr. Kronert, how do you do? - I'd like a consultation. Problems? I don't get ahead in my thesis. We'll work it out. Good bye. Thank you Professor. See you later. - I don't feel like it. If the cat shows up feed her some canned milk. It will get the runs again. - It's shitting everywhere anyways. You heard a review of the new book by Rüdiger Kolczyk "Theses on the decline of social systems." "Now to the business news." Look. Fancy, huh? New. I gave notice to quit the room. Quit? Where are you going? - Away. Away where? - Away away. Somewhere nobody knows me. Give me a break. I always said I'm done after three years. Three years toiling. 10.000 Marks a year. That's 30.000. Enough to go away. 30.000? If you have 30.000... What about you? What about me? - Don't you want out? Why aren't you starting again? Once you've started you don't quit. - Haha. Load of bull. It sucks you're leaving. Mornin' Miezi. - Mornin'. Didn't you hear the bell? A visitor for you. Already? - Yes. A regular. - I haven't even brushed my teeth. Aren't you quitting? Why run off if someone brings the money to her? If you want to get him hard give him beer by Engelhardt's. Oh, it's you! I thought you were at work? - I told them I'd go to the doctor. Then let's restore your health. Morning, beautiful. - Good morning, Professor. How was the weekend? - The usual. Has the mail arrived? - No, but the copies you need to sign. I was just unpacking them. 100 copies. Good layout. - Did you hear the review on the radio? No, I did not. - I wrote it down. "A politically thinking writer who can lead the way to the 21st century. An intellectual with charm, charisma and a sense for stability and integration." I'm telling you, this will be a bestseller! THESES ON THE COLLAPSE OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS We have to drink on that. Could you hold the glasses? I'm so happy for you. Thank you. Is it true you were recommended to go to Bonn? I'm happy that some young friends came... All of them are political friends. Cheers. It's good for you to give this a try. I'm doing this for 50 years. What did you get in 50 years? I always knew what was going on. In 1928 - Hitler. I knew exactly what a thug he was. What do you know now? Son, you could be someone here. Local chairman or head of a department. For a pat on the back. - Some day everything pays off. I'm alright the way I am. Don't look like that! I'm alright! It's Bernd. Hello! The great Hohenberg, how nice. - Still at college? I took a break. You? I might finish next year if I politics leaves me the time. Hohenberg is one of our most active. It's a small world. You could do me a favor. I have to write a project paper. On the relationship of bureaucracy and democracy. There's a lot of material. You know, when I was in America... In North Carolina - I collected a lot of material. Organizing, adding in and writing it down - that's all. How much? Hundred. Two hundred. I'm broke. That's a lot. Fifty. Fifty now, hundred on delivery. I have to go. See! It's already paying off. You don't think I'll be the stepping stone to this career pinko. Don't you want to or don't you trust yourself? Lautenschlaeger and Meysenburg. And a book by Kolczyk. Kolczyk's good. - PhD thesis from 1952. After you. Get undressed. Want a drink? Seen him before. That's it for now. What's that? - Invitations for the next weeks. Cancel it. Cancel it. Cancel politely and I'm very sorry. Accept this one but ask if there will be dinner served. Alone or with your wife? With my wife of course. With wife it is. Do you accept visitors? Is consultation-hour? - Yes, it's 10:30. Let him in. Please, come in. How can I help you? I... - Did I take your name? My name is Bernd Ziegenhals. Ziegenhals is a small village in the south. East Germany. - I know. We used to take trips to Ziegenhals. Starting in Zolten. Maybe... Can we get to the point? It started... Back in 1951. - Started what? It's not that easy. I never did this before. I'm a beginner. Tell me what you want. I have a friend. He studies sociology. - You don't? I went to your lectures in the past but I gave it up. Would you like to visit my classes again? Maybe. I have a friend. - Who studies sociology. This friend... Spent a summer in America. Scholarship. At the Duke University in Durham. North Carolina. You know it. And from Durham this friend brought a paper. From 1949. By the author Charles Emery. Emery wrote a paper with the title "Social Changes in Patton's Landing" And you submitted this work as your PhD thesis. Translated word by word. You faked your PhD thesis. PhD regulations: "The doctoral degree can be withdrawn if it was fraudulently obtained." How much do you want? - Good that you're reasonable. That may change. - That's my problem. Is this necessary? Leave out the empty words. You were so proud about your logical thinking. Wanna hear my logic? I don't wanna perish. I also don't wanna toil in so called self-employment. Selling hot-dogs or suspenders. Or with your words: I haven't internalized the middle-class values. I want to enjoy life. Believe me, I hate you as much as you hate me. We will neutralize it. How much? Ten thousand right now. As dowry. And then... 1.500 every month. Deposited to an bank account. Small fish for you. For how long? Until your ambition is down to zero And you go to the police. This may take until the year 2000. The better for me. Until then, one of us will fall by the wayside. You can count on that. I have work to do. Okay. One or the other. Do not shed a tear... You cried this tear because of me... Allow me to draw this tear... Let it unite with me lips... Well then... to your well-being! Remember to rinse the kidneys. And don't forget about us. Where are you going? Grunewald. Two rooms with kitchen and bath. - Grunewald! Healthy area. I'll visit. That's what all of them say. Funny. I never inherited anything. I always had to pay extra. I'd like to see you cry forever and ever. Evenin' Zicke! Kalle? That's a surprise. - Well... I'm back. What do you want? Is Miezi home? No. She's working. You're looking good. She fed you well, huh? She's really not home? - Nope. Alright then. Bye. Where have you been. It's 1:30 already! I went for a walk. Mr. Ziegenhals. Morning Mr. Ziegenhals. - Morning. Slept well? - Yes. Great! When I look at you I think about my son. Thinking about a daughter would be strange. He was 19 when he was killed in Russia. How old are you? 28. - 28... He was 19. In Russia... In Dnipropetrovsk. My husband died a year ago. There's a lot of free room now. Do you know someone else who's looking for a room? I don't. Could have been. Like the food? - Great! Good afternoon! - Afternoon. What is it? - Am I interrupting? Depends. I'm looking for my nephew Bernd Ziegenhals. Sorry, he moved yesterday. Where did he move to? It would help a lot. I have it written down somewhere. Come on in. There... I have it here. Your nephew became quite the slick fellow. Grunewald... Grunewald. - Yes. You know... I heard things... We always had grief with Bernd. You wouldn't know if he had trouble with the police? Police? I know nothing. I'm an old man, I want no trouble. Bernd moved, that's all I know. What do you want from him? Do you live here too? - Yes. I'd like to talk to you. Sure. Please... Miezi! Don't worry, Grandpa. Please. Have a seat. Sorry. So? I... uh... I'd like to help my nephew. Oh? I didn't know he had an uncle. Are you a friend of his? Shut up, Miezi! It's alright, Grandpa! What do you wanna know? Miezi! - Can't you tell him to stop? I'll do that. Be quiet. I'm trying to have a lay here. See? I wasn't lying. Wanna start? I thought we'd talk about Ziegenhals? - We can do that. Can we meet somewhere else? I have to get back to the office. When and where? Tonight. At the subway station "Schlesisches Tor". 10:30 PM? Prötzel? - Yes, Prötzel. Kalle? - Yes, Kalle. I thought he's behind bars. He's back out. - Since when? Good conduct, get it? Good conduct? What about you? Why the downer look? Weren't you engaged? That's it. I don't get it. Why are you scared of him? Come on! You're pissing your pants when you see him. Don't worry. Just walk up to him, jerk him off And he's peaceful again. You're a goof. He want's her to keep working. Making a buck, get it? There he is. Hey, Kalle! Buy me a drink! - Get lost! There... please. That's the room. It was my son's room. Well. A desk, a bed, a cabinet. That's all young folk need. The bathroom is in the hall to the right. Wanna see? It's alright, I'll take the room. You can give me the keys right away? 200 Marks with bed linen included. Is this rented too? - Yes. Another student. Nice boy. Close your mouth. Or you'll catch a fly. I'm looking for you all day long. Aren't you happy I'm out? No! Let go of me. Let's take a walk. Why? - I want to have a chat. How did you get out? They realized I became a good citizen. I see. What do you do now? - "We" Why "we"? "We" are back together. No... No, I'm out! Don't act up! No way, I'm quitting! In three days I'm stopping. And then I won't look at a dick for at least three years. Especially yours! Miezi, come on. You don't fit in this scenery. You're better then that. You can't keep me hanging. I never kept anyone hanging. But sometime you must look out for yourself. I'll make you a big deal. We'll make a fortune in a few years. I have made enough for me. Oh? How much do you have? That's none of your business. Get lost. Beat it! - Alright. Get fucking lost! - Alright! Alright, I'm going. Damn shit! Mr. Kronert! Weren't you looking for a decent room? Yes, it's not easy. - I found one. Yes? - Pure luck. Let's talk tomorrow. That's great. Thanks. - Good bye. I heard you're leaving us. Not yet. It's you. Please come in. What do you want? - You haven't read the papers yet? There was nothing about your criminal record. PROSTITUTE MURDERED IN KREUZBERG Do you have an alibi? No. Is that why you're here? Is that supposed to be funny? I was her friend. - My sympathies. You don't get it. I'll explain it. For the slow-witted. I was her friend. I didn't kill her. But she had a lot of savings. Police will look me up today. How am I to explain my sudden wealth? The new cloths, the new flat. There's no other way. I have to tell them you gave me the money. You're crazy! - What am I supposed to do? Say I found it or that I won the lottery? Congratulations! Show us your lottery ticket. Got it? Got it! Who's in? - A student. Why can't I go in? - I wouldn't do that. I offer you a version. I, Bernd Ziegenhals, have studied under you. You met me again and you were shocked. Ziegenhals, he's a clever boy. Would be sad if he did not make it. That's why you borrowed me money. A political conscious person in your position can not let a promising young man end up as secretary at the city cemetery office. Got it? - You are promising, indeed. And I get a monthly fee for delivering study material. Because you're working on a book. Let's say... "Crime as a social phenomena" From now on I am... Your private secretary. "Crescit animus quotiens coepti magnitudinem attendit." I'm not able to follow you with the Latin. Courage increases with every glance at the undertakings size. Together we could get things done. With your connections... - I think you should leave. Good bye. - Good bye. You can enter now, Ms. Kolczyk. Do you know when you will be back? Two lectures. One at Warren Hall and one in Berkeley. Why this sudden? You can't just wing the lectures. You think every lecture needs months preparation? What about your courses? Do you cancel them? Yes? - Criminal Police. I'd like to talk to you. Are you still there? No, I fled the country. Come in. Professor. - Evening. Sorry for the bother. - It's nothing. Take off your coat. - Thank you. May I? Let's go to the study. - Very well. Please. - Thank you. Can I offer a cognac? Thanks but I'm on duty. You shouldn't mix business with pleasure. Have a seat. So? A prostitute was murdered last night. Marianne Ihlow. Working name "Miezi". I read it in the paper. You knew her? Yes. - I see. We have a clue... That on the day of the crime... I'm sorry. What shoes do you want packed? I'll get them myself. You were with her in her room. Yes. We're working on a survey about procurement. We are interested in interviewing prostitutes. Interesting. How did you find her? - Well! How does one find a prostitute? Did you get intimate? Who do you think I am? - I know by experience that well distinguished gentleman have a certain taste for cheap hookers. Get to the point. - One moment. Where have you been yesterday between 10 and 11 PM? Let me think. Until 10 I was having dinner with two colleges. Professor Steppens and Breitbart. Then for a stroll down the Ku’damm. Some questions were ailing me. The question of potentialities to integrate unqualified migrant workers. Is that exact enough? Yes. Did you have contact with Mr. Ziegenhals that day? No, why? He said you were his patron. That is overstating it. - You think so? I think he is talented. Talented enough to be flushed with money? He's working for me... As an assistant. I loaned him money. - I see. A loan? How much? - Ten thousand. How much do you make as Professor? Professors also inherit money sometimes. And part of this inheritance you channel off? How noble. Ziegenhals used to visit my tutorials. He lost his way. Did you know your name is Miezi's notebook? With a note for yesterday 10:30 PM. We had an appointment. She did not show. Why the appointment? I already told you. - Right! The survey. Why at "Schlesisches Tor"? Why not in your home? Is it that hard to understand? - For me it is. I have to take in account my position. So I see... - That thinking is not my standard. I do share your standards. Even as a corpse Marianne Ihlow was attractive. That is all. Wait... One more thing. You're going away? To America. Is that illegal? Not at all. Is this the suit you wore yesterday? No, why? I have to ask you to send us the suit. We have to examine it. Routine tests. Do me one favor. - Don't worry... Your wife won't hear a thing. Please make a hand movement Who was it? A journalist who wants to write about sociology. Some day there will be Communists, Maoists, Fascists and Kolczykists. Maybe they keep you in America as a ghost writer for the White House. Honey, I'd like to take my blue suit with me. The one you wore yesterday? - Yes. Why don't you say it? You think I was contracted by Kolczyk! Why would Kolczyk... - Professor Kolczyk! Why would Professor Kolczyk want to eliminate Miezi? He's married. He has a certain position. Let's say she blackmailed him. Blackmailers do not live long. Miezi? Miezi blackmailing Kolczyk? Miezi wasn't the type. She was way too feeble-minded. For blackmail you need brains and steady nerves... Keep talking... - I told you all. You didn't tell me why the Professor took a sudden liking in you. Ask him when he's back from America. He told you he's going to America? Interesting. Didn't he go to America? You should know. You're his... Assistant. Or am I mistaken? You can leave now. Good night. You're playing tricks. You didn't go to America. Hello! You don't want to do it yourself. You don't want to get your hands dirty. You won't wear me down! Kolczyk. - May I speak to the Professor? Who is it? Can you tell me where he is? Not if you're not giving me your name. Mr. Ziegenhals? Mr. Ziegenhals? Mr. Ziegenhals? Oh, Goodness! Oh, God! Mr. Ziegenhals! What is wrong? It is 3 AM. There is a phone call. Come on. There... Get dressed. A gentleman did call for you. I didn't get his name. My God! What's wrong? This is Mr. Kronert. The new tenant. Sorry if I have startled you. Haven't we met yesterday? I forgot my keys. Any family members with a nervous disease? Not that I know of. Any unusual stress as of late? No. Your nervous system shows disturbances. The sensitivity threshold of the reticular zone is too low. Meaning? - You're oversensitive. You're strongly reacting to the smallest irritations. I'll prescribe you a sedative for now. Mr. Cornelius Bischof from New York - Please come to the information desk. A package was delivered. From a certain Mr. Rannow. Should I open it? No, it's alright. Thank you for coming. I come from the bank. There's no money. - That's right. There's a reason. Have a seat. "I, Charles Emery, hereby declare that the paper 'Social Changes in Patton's Landing' was not written by me but rather by Rüdiger Kolczyk." If you wanna read it yourself. Quite the reverse was true. I wrote Emery's paper. Basically I translated my own thesis. I don't get it. I can't have the slightest doubt stain my reputation. I didn't know you or how you would react. You would have made a great fuss about it. Without this affidavit I didn't have any proof that your allegations were wrong. Are you gonna report me? - No, I don't wanna cause a stir. And the money you've given me? - Keep it and choke on it. Now get out. Morning Mr. Ziegenhals. See that cop? Yes. Is he bothering you? He's still thinking it was me. Everyone's a suspect. I'm on their radar too. Everything I touch is shit. - Yep. I know the feeling. The crazy thing is, shit becomes attuned to one. It's saying to itself "This is my kind of guy". See! And that's how I turned 70 years old. Fucking 70! Motherfuckers. Don't sweat it! If it's getting dicey I'll get you an alibi. I know someone who's signing anything for a buck. I'll manage just fine. Duke University in Durham? - That's me! Thanks. What booth? - Did you try to call Mr. Emery? Yes. There is no Mr. Emery. Charles Emery. Mr. Charles Emery died a year ago. Amen. Congratulations! You are the first to bring dead people to write statements. Did you put flowers on Mr. Emery's grave? Well. Let's talk. Get in. So? Maybe it helps... if you know about the situation I was in. I came back from America... I was still in college... I met my wife Then we got married. Too early. Way too early. In '51 Reinhild got sick. Pneumonia and then a bad case of TB. I had to completed my studies and earn money. Reinhild had to go to the sanatorium. Fine. I translated Emery's work and submitted it as my thesis. It's not even that good. Now I could write theses like this with ease. I want no thesis. - You don't get it. You should know my situation. - And show mercy. Sympathy for the great Kolczyk. Yesterday you threw me out. Today I should shed tears? We should renew our deal. You should add another 500 a month. How far are you going? Are you crazy? Stop! There are people who'd do anything for less money than you want. I got used to it by now. You don't put me down. Not you. Goodbye, Professor. Now we get to... Let's look at the theoretical basis of the American unions. The basis... And the principles put forth... Ones they developed. The entrepreneurial individualism... Entrepreneurial individualism and the laissez faire politics between the Civil War and the New Deal... ...led to unfortunate... Put workers in unfortunate positions. How is the room? Great. Thank you. The landlady's nice? Very. Sometimes it's too much. - Why? Well, she will go for two weeks to the GDR. Then I'm alone with this madman. What madman? The other tenant. Ziegenhals... Ziegenhals? - Yes, Bernd Ziegenhals. You know him? There was a Ziegenhals at my seminar. Talented boy but bad tendencies. You can say that. He's whacked-out. Boozes, takes all kinds of pills and is constantly at the Doctor. Some day he'll snap. Sorry to hear that. - His problem. Did Ginny talk to you? About what? I'll go to Copenhagen for a few days. I'd like her to go with me. - Better ask my wife. It's her call. Does he have a good Doctor? Ziegenhals? Dr. Sievers. He's right around the corner. Alright, let's see. 130/90 Nothing to worry about. Any particular problems? What do you mean? Besides the weariness. Sometimes in the bowels. Pain? Like cramps. Lie down please. Lower your pants a bit. Thanks. Now relax. Does this hurt? - No. And this? - No. You can get dressed. Let's do a blood test. When do you have time? Tomorrow at eight? Yes, that works for me. Tomorrow right after getting up take two pills. What's that? Desmoid pills to check the stomach. They degrade quickly. By the degradation speed we check the acidity of the stomach fluids. Progressive. Medicine shouldn't lack behind sociology. Don't worry when you're peeing. Your urine will be green. How lovely. Dr. Sievers? Ziegenhals speaking. The pills you've sent me... You didn't send any pills? Maybe your assistant? You never mail out pills? Then it's a mistake, sorry. Good bye. Professor Kolczyk please. When is he back? Tell him... No, don't tell him anything. What are you doing, fucker? Tell me! I was looking for a match! - And what else? Speak up! Spit it out! What were you looking for? What is going on? There's no fighting in my house! Demean yourselves. This was delivered for you. What a racket! The bottles are broken. I don't understand. What's that now? Throw it away! Throw it away! Give it to me! Let's see. - Gimme. Beat it! Stop! Drop it! Drop it! Are you hurt? - I'm fine. I'll give you hell, bastard! God, my dad will pass out. At least he can't complain then. Sorry, I was lost in thought. It's my fault too. I stopped to quickly. It's the fault of the one tailgating. Fuck! Know what? Over there is a nice café. Let's discuss this in peace. Okay? Thank god you're not making a scene. - Nah. Good morning. Morning. Were you awake? - Yes. How are you feeling? Fine. Know what? I feel like going to the theater tonight. Do that. We could go for dinner afterwards. Sorry. I have work to do. Not even one evening... I told you, I have work to do! Too bad. Too bad you've changed so much. Changed how? You're drinking. You're dreaming every night. You look unwell. See a doctor. Morning, Professor! What do you want? - Nothing special. I'm picking up Ginny. I'm ready. Morning, dad! That's Bernd. Bernd Ziegenhals. The famous Kolczyk. Let's go. One moment. I'd like to talk to you. Ginny! The whole family is present. This is my mother. Good morning, Miss. My name is Bernd Ziegenhals. - Ginny told me about you. Mr. Ziegenhals. Leave my daughter alone. That's not part of our deal. Then we'll make it one. Right now. I'm afraid that's not possible. The pills you've sent me got me real horny. Since I'm peeing green I'm into girls like Ginny. Ginny's waiting, you'll excuse me. "I'm done for" Yeah? Open the windows and turn off the gas! The gas! Hurry! What's that? - I thought you like flowers? They just came. Who would send me flowers? They are for me. I thought you might like the look of them. Cost 50 Marks at least. He isn't that well-off. Kronert's not poverty-stricken either. Kronert didn't send them. You're telling me they are from Ziegenhals? Of course they are. Why Of course? What's your problem with the boy? I like him. Our daughter should have higher standards. He's a nobody! I remember when you were a nobody. Together we had even less. That was a different time. He must have something for Ginny to like him. Let me be the judge! Take the flowers away! A week ago you were praising him. He's one of your best students. What do you want? Get back to the 19th century? Thwart a young love? Spare me the banalities. Take the flowers away. You're intolerable. Have you eaten yet? Yes, thanks. Is Ginny home? She said she might go out again. Where to? With Mr. Ziegenhals. What's wrong? - I... Nothing... I just wanted to make sure that you're still here. What are you reading? What would Kolczyk's daughter read? Your book. And what's the opinion of Kolczyk's daughter? Some good parts, some could be better. Next time I'll do better. For sure. I'm so plastered... I give you credit... You're a true friend... Fuckin' thing... - Not working... It has to work. Get into the car. - But no driving... Think about your license. I'll get matches. Come on. It has to work... Fuckin' car. Goddammit Rulle! Rulle! Suddenly it worked... Where? I know the place. I'm coming. How long will you be gone? - An hour maybe. I'm going for a walk. You could come if you learned to ride. Don't fall off the horse! - Bye. Bye. - Bye! Where's Ginny? You lied. Ginny had no accident. You're lucky you've got a daughter. Evenin' Who is Ruhlsdorff? Ruhlsdorff... That's my humble self. Who's he? - My voucher. Have another one? - Yeah, the same again. Three beers and three shots. Alright. So you want to sell me a tip to break into a bank? Vice versa. You want a tip from me? - Exactly. You know who I am? I forgot. Murder case Marianne Ihlow. Miezi... Unfortunately I'm still on the list of suspects. Unfortunately... I'm sure the killer is known but nobody speaks up. Hold on! You think we know the killer? Someone does. Who would that be? Ziegenhals. Zicke? - Yes. Did he tell you that? - No he didn't. Maybe he has a skeleton in the closet. If he names the killer he'll get amnesty for his past crimes. Who said that? - Inspector Rannow. He'll start talking if that's the case. It wouldn't be nice of me to jump ahead. I can't wait until he decides to talk to the cops. I would pay for the tip. Too dangerous. If you know the term. A thousand. That's a joke but not a proposal. Two thousand. Okay, 2.500 Nope. Sorry. That's not a deal. Let me give you a piece of advice... Get out of here. It's not good if word gets out you're snooping around. Thanks for the beer. Five... Three... The name. Prötzel. The address. What did you tell him? - Nothing. Believe me. Ask Drögnitz. He was also there. Let me go, Prötzel. I'm your friend. I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you how it went down. Speak up. One other thing. Ziegenhals knows something. What's up, Pops? I heard a scream... So you heard a scream? - Yeah... What else did you hear? - Nothing at all. And if I start squeezing? Slowly and with gusto. Then what? Before I ascent into heavenly sphere I ask for a cool Engelhardt beer. Are you looking for someone? Someone's following us. I don't see anyone. He's hiding behind there. That's him. You know him? Yeah... Old buddy of mine. A real nag, always asking for money. Let us take a taxi. Want to come up? - No. Little Ginny goes home and finishes her paper. Your sex life is underdeveloped. - You're crazy. Bye. Hello! What do you want? Get in the car. What's that? - Get in! Are you mad? - Move over! Now what? We'll go on a tour. We've been friends. I always helped you. Yep, collecting money while I was in jail. And now you're Mr. Bigshot. But it's my turn now. What do you want? The cops blame me for Miezi's murder. Have you done it? - That's none of your damn business! Stay put! Where are you going? To the countryside. You think I'd shoot you here? What would you get out of killing me? Pleasure. I'm pleasure-loving. And you know a lot about me. I kept my mouth shut. Yes, you did. But your father-in-law makes trouble. Kolczyk? Who else? He alleges you're having evidence against me. That's bullshit! I have no clue! Why would he make it up? He's Professor after all. Nice area, huh? Think about it! I could have told the cops ages ago! Tell that to your grandma. I have no evidence and I don't think you killed Miezi. You can't be the killer! You wanted her to earn you money! Keep talking... Remain calm. Get in! - Help! Get in! - Help! Help! Help! That won't help you. Motherfucker! Fuck! Stay put! Stay! Fuck! Have a seat. - Thank you. May I smoke? - Of course. Thanks. What do you want to confess? I have nothing to confess... Something's on my mind. I'm worried about Ziegenhals, Inspector. His chances to survive are slim. At least he confessed. That's true. There's the thesis by Camus that only revolt gives life meaning. I wonder... if this assertion is a typical product of the 1950s. Revolting against the given circumstances is a given for an intellectual and therefor of lower value. Sober acceptance however of adverse conditions... Classifying it... Isn't that a higher task to a thinker than revolution? Adaption requires a lot because it goes against the nature of an intellectual. Is that true for politics too? - Of course. Cheers. - Cheers! Bernd! How are you? The doctors say you're doing fine. I brought you something to read. You know what's best? Dad treats us to a trip to the island of Sylt. I hope you like Sylt. Say something. Okay. If you need anything... I'll visit tomorrow. Good bye. Bye. Hey there, son! - Hey! How's it going? I'm alright. - Here... I brought you something to regain your strength. Hand me a mirror. I don't have no mirror. In the bag. What do you want to look at? It's not that bad. I just wanna see how winning looks like. What's the time? Five past two. I've got an appointment at three. There's still time. You're preoccupied. How do you feel? Fine. Really? - Yes. Fine. Where is he? We're already on air. Call a doctor! - What's wrong? Where is he? A doctor is coming. The results came in yesterday. Sadly the suspicion was confirmed. We must confront the disease. Say it. It's the colon... Say that it is cancer. Yes. Inspector Rannow Police Hello! Can you take this with you? - Sure. Thanks. I welcomed the relationship between you and Ginny. I know Ginny... don't give up hope. I hate platitudes but don't throw in the towel yet. What's your plan? I'll do the oral exam and then... Wait and see. I have a few good offers. What about you? Is the career in Bonn going to happen? Sadly yes. Sadly? I never asked for it. It caught me off guard. Is Ginny going to Bonn too? No, she will stay. I sell the house. I'm looking for a suitable flat for her. Maybe around here. I'll be right back. Hi Bernd! Hi there! Nice of you to come. I looked around. The place is great! This is the living room. Sitting corner... TV. That's the place for my desk. Dining area. The Kolczyk ancestral portraits above. Look at the view. Marvelous, isn't it? Trees, green. Sunshine all day long. Beautiful. Yep. Dining area? TV? There. Sitting corner. - Here. Whatever! It's not going to happen. Why? Don't you like it? Is it too expensive? Neither. - What is it? You and Ginny won't move in here. I thought... - I've got news. I'm ill... terminally ill. Incurable. I have nothing to lose. Am I clear enough? I'm saying... The viewpoint changes when you know time's up. Tough luck for you. That's just one of your scummy tricks! Admit that it's a trick! I know you! Ask Dr. Sievers. He recommended a colostomy. I declined. No tricks. Colostomy? - Yes. That's better than croaking! Hundreds are living with a colostomy! Dr. Sievers! He's just a fucking family doctor! Maybe the results are wrong? Cancer isn't what it used to be. I read just recently that it's not a reason to capitulate. There's always a chance. You can't just give up like that! This needs a good deal of thought! Don't just pack it all in! Kiss my ass and goodbye! Now, of all times... There's a suggestion. Kolczyk? Kolczyk! Where are you Kolczyk? For God's sake! What happened? Where on earth are you? Quick! Call the police! From up there... Do something! Bastard! Bernd Ziegenhals was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of murder and extortion. Subtitles by SingaporeJoe, 2023
