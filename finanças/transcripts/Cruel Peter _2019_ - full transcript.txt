Is this true? No, Mother. PETER: She's a liar. PETER'S MOTHER: Did you hear what Peter said, Giovanni? Yes, milady. - But that would... - The girl is a liar. That'll be the end of it. I want her off my property by this evening. PETER'S MOTHER: You know I love you, don't you? I do. Give me the razor, Peter. No, Mother. Please, do it for me. My father gave it to me. It's mine. [MOUSE SQUEALING] [MOUSE SQUEALS] [MOUSE SCREECHING IN PAIN] [ALFREDO GRUNTS] I see you found your dog in the end. Inside a box. Underground. It's your fault. You took too long. The garden isn't so big. [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Lasciami! PETER: Try it... peasant. Lay one hand on me and my mother will cast your family out. And you... will starve.

[WINCES] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [GRUNTS] Let me out! [BANGING ON DOOR] Let me out of here, you bastard. I'll have you killed for this. [BANGING ON DOOR] [GRUNTS] [BANGING CONTINUES] [YELLING] [BATS SCREECHING] [SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Your materials are here, Professor Nash. - From Froome? On my desk please. - Yeah. No, not yet. Please tell me, why do you have this book? [SIGHS] Fine. I think I'm in for it with Liz. Boys? [CHUCKLES] Christ, no. She thinks I'm a total idiot. In reality I suspect it's something to do with her mother. Do you think she feels guilty? Guilty? Liz? After she died, you stopped traveling, locked yourself away. I hate to say it, but you're wasting your life. Maybe Liz thinks it's... because of her. What person's gonna give me a chance after messing up like that? There's a restoration job going in Italy. Quite interesting, not too demanding. Where? Town in Sicily. There's even a school for Liz. [NORMAN CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You've thought of everything, boss. That way you can show the world what I already know. That you can still run a site. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] BIANCA: And this is the English cemetery. Much of it destroyed by the earthquake. Along with almost 90% of the estate's capitals. Messina was one of the richest cities in Sicily. And English ancestors did good business here. It's probably not the most interesting place for a young girl. Oh, when she was six years old, Liz was playing in the Catacombs of Paris amongst millions of skeletons. She'll be fine. [WIND HOWLING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [BIRDS COOING] The school is a two-minutes walk from the house. You can go straight through the wood. NORMAN: "I can walk myself." Alone? We'll see. Teenagers, no? Tell me about it. [NORMAN WHISTLING] [NORMAN HUMMING] Professor. - Norman. - [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Norman. Uh, you should come for lunch at my house sometime. If you like. My aunt is a great cook and she'd love to meet you. [EXHALES] Liz is a vegan. It's a touchy subject. That's no problem for Aunt Emma. Great. Yes. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] NORMAN: Grazie. Grazie. "Here is cruel Peter Hoffmann. "See. "A horrid and wicked boy was he." [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What did he say? Um... These toys have been put there for a little boy. That way, he can keep playing in the next life.

Yes, Oxford. I didn't think there were any English people left here. Somebody remained. Uh... My daughter can't hear, but she lip reads very well. - Her name is, uh... - Liz, yes, as you said. Right. I'm Norman. Pleased to meet you. I hope to see you again. Bye. [TYPING] [WIND WHOOSHING] [GASPS] [BIRD COOING] [GROANING] Mom! NORMAN: This is Edgar Hoffmann. He committed suicide in 1907, slitting his own throat. Why did he do it? Well, no one seems to know. It was a big scandal at the time. He was one of the wealthiest men on the island and Peter was his son. Now, he disappeared on the 25th of December, 1908. That's three days before the earthquake, and he was never found. - Hmm. - Twelve years old at the time. Quite the mystery. BIANCA: They destroyed it. Do these cameras work? Ah, unfortunately, they don't. Well, make them work. Yes, sure. [MIMICKING CHOKING] [WHISPERING IN ITALIAN] Ho una cosa per lui. AUNT EMMA: A gift for you. What is it? It's a piece of material that has been bathed in holy water. Inside it, there's an image of Christ. She'd never admit it, but she has one too. My auntie believes that the dead can either be good or evil. This helps keep the evil ones away. [CRYSTAL BALL REVOLVING] [WATER SPLASHING] [LIZ PANTING] You used this? Don't worry. This... [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's only a toy. It's not a toy? You heard Mum? Please. You couldn't. It's impossible. "What will it take for you to believe me?" [PLACES BALL IN BOX] Liz... [CROWS CAWING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Bianca. [FAUCET RUMBLING] [WATER CONTINUES RUNNING] [LIZ GASPING] [SHRIEKS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] What's missing? Uh, in this mess it's difficult to know. Where is the metal box? It was right here and now it's gone. I'm sorry, Bianca. Liz and I, we got off to a bad start this morning. We can talk about it if you want. - [MAN HUMMING] - [PLAYING GUITAR] [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Correva l'anno 1908... I never asked you what brought you here. I mean, for someone of your experience... it's a little low key. I thought that was common knowledge. Not for me. Five years ago... my wife and I were working on a dig in Turkey. During the excavation, we... uncovered this Roman sarcophagus. Beautiful. Totally intact. All I had to do was clean it up and it would have been perfect. I could've waited till the next day. But [CHUCKLES] I was so excited that I... I couldn't leave it. So I sent Jane home in her car... with Liz. A truck... knocked her car off a bridge. While I... was dusting the earth off piece of marble. I lost her... and Liz lost her hearing. The day after the accident... I... I returned to the site, I grabbed a pickax, and I smashed that sarcophagus into pieces. [INDISTINCT HISSING] [DISTORTED] Go away. Go away. [CONTINUES HISSING] [CHOKING] [SHRIEKS] [PANTING] [SQUELCHING] [LIZ WHIMPERING] [SQUELCHING CONTINUES] [LIZ WHIMPERING] [SQUEALS] "Tomorrow... "school finishes early." Shall I pick you up? I'm sorry about earlier. [SIGHS] Liz. I'm confused. Please tell me, why? I don't buy that. Something is up. I eat meat. But with you there, never. Please. Can we talk about this together? That's enough! I'm your father. And I don't want any cheeky talk from you. I'm not the father of the year, but... I'm trying my best to connect with you and you're just driving me crazy. [SCOFFS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] CALARCO: Professor Nash. Lieutenant Calarco, the Carabiniere. Finally. We've been waiting for you. We've had some tomb damage and a theft. Oh. What did they steal? A, uh, a metal box containing some toys and, uh, a wooden tombstone. That is not much of a robbery. [SCOFFS] Have you made any enemies here? Enemies? [SCOFFS] Whatever for? Maybe you did something wrong? I'm simply trying to protect this cemetery against vandals and decades of neglect. This cemetery, not a colosseum. No one cares about the dead. Well, I do, for a start. Professor, take my advice. Go back to England. How about you do your job... I'll do mine. I am. I am. Hello! [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] Hey. [PANTING] [BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE] [CLICKS TONGUE AND SIGHS] What were you thinking? The whole place is crumbling. All the coffins are full of rusty nails. Last week, Giuseppe hurt himself the same way. It wasn't a nail. This wasn't there before. [LAUGHTER] [HARRIET SQUEALS PLAYFULLY] [LAUGHING] Sure you wouldn't like some? I just wanted to apologize. For what? I'm a complete stranger and there I was chasing your daughter around the woods. You could've got the wrong idea. I didn't get any idea. Well, I'm the one who should be reprimanded. I was three hours late from picking her up at school. [CHUCKLES] She seemed to manage just fine. With a father like me, she has to. Don't be so hard on yourself. We do what we can for our children. Do you have kids? No. It's getting late. I should get going. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [LAUGHTER] [NORMAN EXHALES HEAVILY] [COUGHING] [SIGHS] MAN: I scared you. I try to defend the villa... as I can. [LIQUID POURING] Questo and de Padre Nicolo. He lost his arm... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Nel terremoto. In the earthquake. And who's this? His brother. Alfredo. He was not so lucky. What about Peter Hoffmann? Your father must have told you something about him. [INHALES SHARPLY] Well... my father said... in all his life... he never met anyone as mean as Peter. He enjoyed hurting others, and he did it without fearing to be punished. His mother always protected him. She also did it when he killed his father. Peter wanted his mother for himself. She silenced what happened, claiming it was a suicide. Everybody knew the truth in the villa, but they were too scared to talk. One day, my uncle, tired of that cruelty, decided to make him pay. Peter had to be stopped. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [CAWING] MATTEO: But Alfredo was not a murderer. And my father convinced him to set him free. Unfortunately... he chose the wrong day. [LOUD RUMBLING] [ROCKS RATTLING] [RATTLING STOPS] [GRUNTS] MATTEO: Corpses everywhere. Tens and thousands of bodies were thrown into mass graves. Alfredo! MATTEO: With death everywhere, no one cared about Peter and Alfredo's fate. Alfredo! Alfredo! Alfredo! MATTEO: It was the 28th of December, 1908. The city of Messina was completely destroyed. Mrs. Hoffmann didn't accept the idea of losing this boy she loved more than anything. And they were not only rumors. That woman was a witch. Back in the villa, my father saw her while she performed a ritual on the body of a housekeeper. As soon as she was pulled from the rubble... Mom. ...that lifeless body spoke with Peter's voice. Help me. Help me. On the same night, Mrs. Hoffmann disappeared in the woods and nobody saw her again. People say she's still looking for Peter, and that she won't find peace until they're back together. [UTENSILS CLINKING] Let's try to finish classifying the monuments tomorrow. I want to get back to London as soon as possible. - Why? - It's Liz. She's unwell, she needs help. That's a bishop sphere. Yes, it is. It's a dangerous thing. Why is it in this house? Liz had it. She's been trying to contact her mother. And what happened? Nothing. Nothing! Her mother's dead! What do you think happened? Liz should see Aunt Emma. We already moved a month ago, so this is past normal. By using that thing, Liz could have left a doorway open. I'm just asking you to let her spend a day with my aunt. You've met her. She's a good person. [SIGHS] She understands things that others do not. And I will be there. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] BIANCA: They are making a cake. NORMAN: What did your aunt say? She's just trying to get her to relax. We'll see. [EGG CRACKING] - Norman? - Yes? - I'd be sorry if you left. - Me too. But I have to look after Liz. Okay. Right. I'm gonna finish my rounds. - See you soon. - [CELL PHONE BEEPS] [GASPS SOFTLY] [WIND WHISTLING] [OBJECTS CLATTERING] - Liz! - [CHEWING NOISILY] Zia! Zia! Zia! Zia! Zia!

Liz is possessed. She had black magic marks on her body. The marks of the witch. Hello, sweetheart. Help you? Yes? You wanna go home? - No. No, don't do it. - Norman, please. That's enough. She's terrified. We are going back to London, tomorrow. - Out of my way. Please. - Please. - Out of my way. - I beg you. [SIGHS] [BREATH TREMBLES, WHIMPERS] Tomorrow, you and I will go back home. You will feel... much better. [CALL RINGING ON LAPTOP] [SIGHS] I'll get it. - Hi, Rod. - Hi! Did you try to call me? I did. I need to talk to you. It's important. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [FLESH SEARING] [LIZ SCREAMS] What's that? [WINGS FLUTTERING] [FLUTTERING CONTINUES] Liz? Liz? Liz, stay there. Stay there, Liz. [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Not Liz. Peter. No. No! [PANTING] Liz! [PANTING] Liz, hey... Liz! Liz! [INDISTINCT WHISPERS] Liz... [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [WOMAN HUMMING INDISTINCTLY] - [GRUNTS] - BIANCA: Stay still. NORMAN: I've to get back to the woods. - I have to find her. - You'll never find the way. Dark forces have been unleashed. And they will keep you from it. What am I supposed to do? Just accept that I've lost my daughter? [SPEAKS ITALIAN] Diglielo. There is a water tank at the back. We have to find Peter's body and exorcise it. - But we must do it tonight. - [EXHALES DEEPLY] - Or she'll be lost forever. - But it's impossible. [SCOFFS] It could be anywhere. [GLASS CLINKING] [IN ENGLISH] Then we must ask someone who knows... and this time, you must believe. Hm. Alfredo, I call out to you. Alfredo... I call out to you. Alfredo, are you there? [SIGHS] [SCREAMING] ALFREDO: Hello, Peter. I left you some air. More than what you gave my dog. [GRUNTING] [DISTANT SHRIEK] I know where he is. [PANTING] I know where he is, but he was trying to tell me something. - BIANCA: Who? - Alfredo. It's Peter's mother. She's the one who took Liz through the woods. She was here, in my house. And my daughter said something about speaking to Jane. She wasn't lying. But it wasn't her mother she saw, it was Peter's mother. [KNOCKING] Liz? Good evening, Norman. I'm sorry to bother you so late, - but I'm quite sure that I saw Liz. - Where? In the woods. - Can I come in? - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] No! Don't come in, witch! [HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM] [CRACKLING] [AUNT EMMA CHANTING IN ITALIAN] [THUMPING] [CONTINUES CHANTING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Amen. [BREATHING HEAVILY] We are safe in the house. The witch cannot come in until somebody invites her. Take the car and go to the cemetery. Once there, you will be safe. The witch cannot walk on consecrated ground. BIANCA: And what about you? Don't be afraid, honey. I'll be fine. You know what to do. - Thank you, Emma. - Now go.
