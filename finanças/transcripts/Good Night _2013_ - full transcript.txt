The owners who were here really loved this house. They just loved it. It's about 1800-1900 square feet. Lots of sunlight too. Lots of sunlight, yes! And it's a great neighborhood. Very family residential neighborhood. And of course, you don't have anyone on the other side of you, which is really good, because for private... Right. So we can have... - A very private backyard. There's a dishwasher? - There's a dishwasher. So you won't have to do as many dishes, honey. - Me? Yeah. - Okay. And of course, countertops... they're nice. You know. No marks on anything and this is really nice and... The tiles on the floor, I mean. I love this Italian tile. And I love the cathedral ceilings. - Yeah. Yeah. Ceiling fan is good. We have our formal dining room for dinner parties. Oh yes. - Yes. What do you think something like this would... cost... like... to keep cool? Okay, let's see what we have here. Oh! A little tiny bathroom. What about... is the roof new? Is that under warranty still, or is that...? I don't think... The only thing that's going to cover this is your homeowner's warranty. I'm interested. - Yeah. She's interested. Very interested. It's a good... it really is a good deal. It's a great house. It's a very pretty house. And big enough for you for a long, long time. And finally... We have the master bedroom closet. Wow. What do you think? I think this is bigger than our bedroom, baby. I know, isn't it beautiful? This is great. - I like it. I don't even think we have enough clothes to fit in here. I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to have to take this. I'll be right back. Hello? I love it. I love it! I love it! I love it! Yeah. Are you sure, baby? - This is it. I mean it's more than we said we wanted to spend. - This is it, Winston. This is it. I can feel it. But this is not where we said we wanted to live. I know, but we can do it. We can afford this. Do you have any idea how far we are from downtown? Yes, I do. And this place is perfect for us. It's everything we want. And it's not like it's a bad investment. Please? Please? Pretty please? That's so unfair. Pretty, pretty, pretty please. But what about the one with the cool garage that had like-- Pretty please? But it had all the cool shit-- It was like the coolest garage ever. I like this place. Sorry about that, guys. I had to take that. So, what do you think? Am I hearing yes? Am I too early? - No, come in. Happy birthday! Thank you. - Look at you. It's good to see you. You look beautiful. - Thank you. Hello. How are you? - Hey. How are you? Good. Good to see you. - I got a little wine. A little bit of wine here? - Yeah. Yeah. Set this up. I didn't end up inviting my brother. - Okay. And he's coming? - He's coming. And Hamilton is coming. - Oh good. I haven't seen him in a while. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. Happy birthday. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. My two favorite people. Happy birthday! Oww! Oww! Stop it! I hate it when you do that. Sorry. Happy birthday. Morris, it's good to see you. - Good to see you. I wouldn't describe this as gospel, but we have just a group of singers. Yeah. Is there a positive message woven into the...? - No. Is there a negative message? - No. Okay. So there's no-- - It's ambivalent. I don't think you really do this for... Smell it. ...bottles of wine that are less than 20 dollars. Hey! - Hey. Did you mention you were bringing Herbert? Oh, I'm so sorry. We couldn't find a sitter. And he wanted to come so badly. Hey buddy. - Hey buddy, what's up? Are we putting you out, Leigh? No, of course not. - I'm so sorry. Of course not. Of course not. Come this way. Follow me, follow me. - Thank you. Be careful, Charlie. Let's get you something to drink. Sorry about this. - It's fine. He's fine. He was awake pretty much the whole time we were in the car. He was awake the whole time in the car, so he should sleep pretty well for a couple of hours. That's good. We like that. We like sleepy Herbert. Pretty much the same amount of people bowl. Every year. And so it's really hard to open a new bowling alley, unless it's in one of those lifestyle centers. That's great if you're established. Yeah, but... I don't know how much we can ever expand. Happy Birthday! Thank you for coming. Of course. How was your flight? My arms are killing me. Other than that, I'm great. Shut up! Finally, everyone has arrived. Look who's here! Hey. - Hugs all around. Hello. - How are you? Good, good to see you. - Good to see you. Long time, no see. - Long time, babe. How are you? - Good. How are you? Good. - Good, good. Come right this way. So... You were right. I'll be right back. You got it? Isn't everyone here? Yeah. Don't hate me. What did you do this time? Oh, good. I was beginning to wonder if this was the right place. Oh my God. Leigh. Happy birthday. - Thank you. Happy birthday. How are you? - Wow. Hi. - Hi. Hey, I'm Winston. We spoke on the phone. - Maxwell. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Make yourself at home. - Alright. I'm going to finish dinner. Charlie! Charlie, hurry! CHARLIE! Please help! - WHAT? It's a cockroach! Charles Henry! - I got you! Get away from it. - Alright, alright, alright... That is disgusting, Winston! Ew. That is disgusting. - Wait, wait, wait. Nice shot. Hang on, man. - Wow. Sorry, Lucy! He's big though, man. Look at it. You've done that before. - I've killed a few roaches. I apologize! You're not going to wash your hands? You want to watch? Now THAT's disgusting. - It is kind of gross. You want a drink? - Yeah, I do. You know what I like. Wine's fine. - Alright. Wine's fine. Yeah, we do. And guess what, we also have a local paper. Ladies and gentlemen... Dinner is served. Thank you, baby. - Thank you. This looks delicious. - Yeah, it looks good. Yeah, this is fresh from Leigh's garden. I didn't know that. - Wow! - It's true. Nice work. - That is awesome. It's a bloody miracle. This is unbelievable. Yeah. Did you make the dressing? - No. He did. So... Herbert's getting big. How old is Herbert, by the way? 16 weeks. When do they go off the week system, by the way? Just a few more, honey. I kind of dig it. I think when he's 10 it should be like... "He's 520 weeks." Is he sleeping regularly yet? He's getting better. He's not really that bad. So... any of you guys thinking about having children? Oh yeah. Well... We have a Mercedes. So... - So no plans for the future? Well, you know... the Mercedes keeps us pretty busy. Congratulations. - That's very funny. You guys want to trade? I mean, any time. - We should talk. Alright. - Alright. No, we don't need a Mercedes. Shot that down. I guess we won't talk. How many miles per gallon? - Not going to talk about it. Because the baby gets like 45. It's not that bad. Speak of the devil. Time to fill her up. Wow. You're so terrible. It's too early for that. - No? Fill the baby up. - Yeah. She needs some food probably. I think I just got that. That's that yogurt sauce. I love that. I'll have some. How's life in Lawyer Town, guys? Lawyer Town? It's good. Occasionally fun. Sometimes rewarding. Lots of hours. It's a lot of work. Yeah? - Yeah, it's a lot of hours. Although you work more than I do, a lot more. Yes, I probably do work more than you do. Probably? You work a lot more than I do. Really, not that much. How much would you say? I would say I work 60 to 75 hours a week. Ballpark. That's my ballpark. Her ballpark of how many hours a week she works is probably... realistically... 80 to 95 hours a week. Wow! - That is a lot. That's a lot! That's a typical week. You know I was actually working that many hours a week for a while. Yeah, but that was two jobs, right? That's right. - Yeah. One of them he can't say anything about. You know, I don't mind. I don't mind. I enjoy my job, and they pay me well for every one of those 95 hours. Yeah. They pay you very handsomely. I bet if you weren't at this table, you'd be at the office at this very moment. Really? - Yeah. It's possible. - It's definite. So glad you are here. You made the right choice. - You think so? Do you have paralegals working under you? Or do you run as a team? We do have paralegals. I mean, we have... OH! - OH! Here. - I'll get that. Thank you. Jake... Can we get some soda water and a paper towel? Would you mind if I used your... - Yeah, just come with me. It's okay, guys. Just leave it. It's okay. - No big deal. Not that much. Very smooth, Don Juan. - Fuck off! Sorry. Dude, don't worry about that. I don't want to use your... - It's not that much. - Do you have a towel? Everybody's grown up with either one mother or one father. It's all different kinds of situations. The argument that it can't be two fathers, two mothers... Some of them, maybe some of them are bad. Some of them might be the best parents. But then, the kid is going to grow up thinking that is normal. There's no justification that that's-- How is it abnormal? - How is it abnormal? Because it... Love is love. Whether you decide it's a choice, or you're born that way... Most people are not gay. But there's no way that it's a quality. And if you are raising them in a household... Happy birthday to you! And many more! Make a wish! Make a wish! I wish to never have to make another wish again. That's terrible. Alright, here we go! - I say that a lot. Forks, forks! - Hey, fork me. It's really good. - It's really moist. The icing is so good. It's like... More xanthum gum? - Xanthum gum? It's delicious. - I'm hearing, hearing word of deliciousness from that end of the table. It's almost... It's almost savory. It's very rich. - Yeah, it's good. Cinnamon's good. - Yeah. It's like a little orange zest or something. Thank you, guys. - Is it good? I think it's really great. - It's really good with the wine. Me too. I love this chocolate cake. - It's good, huh? It's so good! - There's more. So, enjoy. - Good. Thank you guys. - Yeah. Seriously. Happy birthday, Leigh. Happy birthday, Leigh. - Happy birthday, Leigh! Thanks, pals. Thanks for being here. - Happy birthday. - We love you. I love you. - Thanks for coming, guys. You want a cigarette? - Okay. Are you interested in a cigarette? I was trying to get someone to listen to me. You're choosing baseball because it's more patriotic, not because it's a better sport. Are you guys planning on smoking outside all night? Back and forth? Back and forth? You're welcome to join us. Do you want to come outside with us? Yeah. Hey, you know what? They can smoke inside. Winston, are you sure? It's fine. - Are you sure, dear? Are you sure? - It's for one night, right? One. One night. I think it's a fantastic idea. - Alright. And if I may, can I have one? - Sure. Hey. Can I have... Can I get one? - Of course. There you go. - Thanks. What are you doing, dude? You are terrible. - Oh my God. Honey, are you going to be on your phone all night? Costa Rica... - Don't be constrained by your idea... ...of what a home it. So you do mainly residential? Well, I do all residential. Yeah. But I'm dealing primarily with clients that... have never designed a home before. I mean, we all live in homes that we didn't design. Maximillian. Can I ask you a question? Sure. I don't want this to come off as sounding rude. At all. But what the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck... did you just say that? I was invited. By Winston. And I don't think that Leigh knew I was going to be here. Do you know how cute you are? Not as cute as you. So... Should I do this? It's up to you. We already fucked them up. You okay? You sure? You need to date. You're hot. You're single. You're smart. I know, I know. But the past two times... There's no time. There's no time. You can make time for sex. Hey, Morris. Earlier, we were talking. - Yeah, yeah. Back to this. - Okay. So, just a quick question. - Okay. You know, nothing. Don't get all fuckin' riled up about it. But... In regards to 9/11-- - Yeah? Do you think that the twin towers fell from the impact of the planes? Yeah. I mean-- - Yes. Yeah? - Yeah. Because a building that size can't... can NOT fall into its own imprint. Yes, it can. ...footprint from two airplanes hitting them. Yes, it can. We watched that on television. Ask the architect. Max? I can speak to steel beams, but I can't speak to some of the fixtures that were in the towers, that were not steel, so... I don't feel so good. Well, it serves you right for smoking. I don't think it's the smoke though. You okay, Charlie? Yeah. I... I feel kind of weird. It might have been the food or something. I've disagreed with Indian before. Building 7. - Building 7. It was the third building that later in the day fell... I have something I'd like to tell everyone. Well... There's no good way to say this, so... Here goes. The bone marrow transplant... ...didn't work. And... My leukemia has come out of remission. I'm sorry. I'm okay. I'm okay. Really, I am. What does this mean? It means what it means. Are you sure you're okay? Yes, I'm sure. I mean, are you okay-okay? Do you need anything? - I'm okay. Honestly, listen to me, everyone. I'm fine. What do you mean, "it means what it means"? But, you look so good. Why, thank you. - Yeah. That'll probably change too, in the near future. When'd you find out? I started feeling bad again about... four weeks ago. When are you going back into the hospital? I'm not going back. Listen. It's metastatic. What does that mean? So that means it's spreading. It's no longer just in my bone marrow. My cancer is a stage 4-B. And there is no 5 or C. What happened to the transplant? I guess it didn't work. Get another transplant. I've had enough transplants. You can do another round of chemotherapy. But there's another treatment. There's something else. Look, look. What's the next step? Look. This sounds super cheesy, okay, but look, miracles DO happen. They happen. They happen! - That's right. They happen every day. There's not a single doctor in the world, that's going to tell a 28 year old girl to stop fighting her cancer. It doesn't-- Okay. Calm down, Morris. We don't need to let this derail into something negative. What else could this conversation be, if it's not negative? I just need more time to figure it out, Morris. Stop being dramatic. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this is a little dramatic. I apologize. I'm going to get a drink. Okay? - Okay. Would anybody else like a drink? Tequila. - Bourbon Whiskey. Why did you wait until just now to tell us? Is this... some sort of pity party? Look. I know I'm dropping a bomb on you. But you have to make an effort to understand where I'm at. I mean... do you really want to cry about it? Again? Didn't we already sort of have this conversation when I was first diagnosed? That was three years ago, Ruth. I just... I knew my friends would understand. I do. I just need to go out and get some air. I feel really weird. I have a question. Shoot. Are we high? Yes. Wait... WHAT? Wait. May I ask what you were thinking? I baked it into the cake. I knew it! I knew it. That cake tasted like pot. How do you do that? The butter and the oil. I'll tell you about it later. This is-- - Awesome. This is so insensitive, Winston. This is so insensitive. I mean, did you have the common courtesy or respect to think that I'm breast feeding a child? I mean, I know you guys are okay with just throwing it all to hell, but what do I do the next time I feed him? Get him high? I hope you're not laughing at me. Okay, look. I'm sure everything is fine. I think we just need to calm down for a second. No. Just shut up, Charlie! Shut up! Damnit! Thank you. Thank you. Leigh... Winston... People have lives, you know? I for one have yoga tomorrow morning. And I worked 10 hours today. I just... I think I'm not alone in this. I would have liked to have been consulted. I'm so sorry, Sue. Yeah. I didn't use that much. Still, I... You know... There are people walking around today who... 20 years ago, their doctors said, "Hey. You've got a year to live." Let's just drop it. Okay? I'm going to go check on the others. Please, let's just drop it. I just cannot believe they just willingly gave us pot. - I know. I want to go home. We can't. - Why not? Because it would look TERRIBLE. Okay? I didn't know this was going to happen, but we can't just leave. We need to spend time with her. Not like this. This is a nightmare. I know. Okay? You're right. Don't "you're right" me. I know-- - Hey, hey. Hey, Winston. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay. I'm so sorry for you. Thank you. We screwed up. We didn't even think about it at all. We didn't even realize you were going to... You know, we would never EVER, EVER, EVER... do anything... to hurt baby Herbert. You know, we've just been through a lot, and... I know. I just... I just wish I had known. I know. Well, on the bright side, it's not like he was never going to try pot anyway. Right? Everyone, doesn't my wife look radiant? Having just had a baby? Okay. So, are we cool? Cool as ice. Really cool. Do you mind if I put some music on? - Please! That's a good idea. - Do it. Let's do it. Let's get this party started. - Alright. I'm going to have some more of that cake. You would! Leigh has been my best friend for as long as I can remember. When we were young, my house was across the street from her house. And since we were the same age, we naturally did a lot of stuff together. School, dance recitals, family vacations. I remember playing mash with her at slumber parties, when we would talk about what our dream house might look like when we grew up. When she and Winston found that house, she called me and the first words out of her mouth were, "Alright, it's not my dream house," "but I've just got a really strong feeling about it." Then when they got a really good deal on the mortgage, and didn't have to make a down payment, this seemed to confirm to Leigh that it was meant to be. "So let's start a family." Sometimes I think back on that moment, listening to her, as one of the last times I saw her REALLY truly happy. But the problem was... she couldn't get pregnant. After trying everything they could think of, Leigh went to her doctor, and then to another doctor. And that's how she found out she had cancer. They diagnosed her with acute myeloid leukemia. And basically, the way she explained it, Her bone marrow wasn't creating healthy blood cells, which was, in turn, messing up her immune system. They said it might be fatal if she didn't start chemotherapy right away. What made it worse, was there were times she'd improve. The doctors would say she was better. But it never seemed to last, and she'd end up back in the hospital weeks or months later. The HMO's started refusing to cover certain parts of her bills, and she and Winston didn't know what to do. On top of that, they got behind on their mortgage, and Winston kept saying, they'd get back to even when Leigh got better. But she kept getting sick. All their plans seemed to be ruined. They thought about filing a lawsuit against the HMO, in a last desperate attempt to get something out of someone, but it was too much for them. What's difficult for me... is that even though I know this is happening to my friend, I feel like it's kind of happening to me too. I don't really know what I'd do if I was in her situation, but... for some reason I just can't accept that this is how I'm going to lose her. I've listened to her questions about the afterlife. I've sat in the waiting room, until 3:00 a.m. comforting Morris. I've cleaned her house, and done their laundry and made meals for them. I watch the stress eat away at her marriage, and lately, I've felt something... new between them. I can tell that they're holding something back. What the fuck is going on out there? I don't know. Did Leigh tell you about any of this? She mentioned something, but I didn't know she was going to do this. They don't have what I want here. I'm going to go to the store. Hey, I'm going to go to the store and get some tonic. Anybody want anything? But we have tonic, don't we? - I looked. You guys are all out. Are you sure you don't want something else? I just want tonic water. Everybody cool? Are you okay to drive? Yes, I'm okay to drive. Alright, I'll be right back. I'll go with him. I know where the store is. Yeah? Alright. Yeah, and I'm going to go and grab some tic-tacs. Be back. Okay... You guys going to come with? I guess I'll waiting to open the presents until you get back. Alright. So... So hurry. Here's my present, Leigh. Thank you. - Happy birthday. You shouldn't have. Oh, but I did. I like the house. Thank you. Yeah, it looks good. I like all the colors. That's right. You haven't been given a tour yet. Would you do me the honor? Certainly. Anyone else? - I'm good, thank you. Okay. Come on. Thank you. Yeah. Lucy. Yes, Hamilton? I... was reading something the other day. I saved my pictures of you. You did not. I did. I know exactly which shoe box they're in at my storage facility. Has a little label on it that says, "In Case Of Fire, Throw In." You're such a romantic. Come on. You know a lot about homeschool! Do you even know anything about homeschool? Yeah. Do you have children that we're unaware of, Hamilton? Yes, he does. - How many? I can neither confirm nor deny, but when I have one, that I'm unaware of and I'm responsible for, I'm going to homeschool the kid. Why homeschooling? Because of the broken machine that is the public education system. Wow. That's bold. Hey, can I get some of that? Yeah. It has been a while since I've done this. You're going to be in trouble, dude. What she doesn't know, doesn't hurt her. Okay. Cool. So did you guys know she was going to do that? Do what? Tell us what she told us, when she told us. No idea. Do you think she knew when she invited us? She knew when she invited us. Are you kidding me? Does that seem, I don't know, weird? You know what, Charlie? I don't want to talk about it right now. Okay? - What? I don't want to talk about it right now. Can you see how some people want to talk about stuff, traumatically, that just happened to them? And that by you telling them not to talk about it... makes it worse? Can you see how I wanted to be alone? And I was gracious enough to let you tag along? And now you're violating that generosity? Can you guys stop acting like boys? Fuck. How can you not want to talk about this? Because we fuckin' deal with pain in our own different ways! Can you just let me deal with it in silence? It's okay to be upset, dude. I know it's okay to be upset. You don't have to fuckin' tell me... You get your own car, you make your own trip. If I decide to tag along without really asking to on your own trip, you can make your own fuckin' rules. Okay? Charlie, it was my idea to come to the store. I'm the one driving the car. I think I have some authority on what we discuss, or if I choose not to discuss something, we do not discuss it. Fine, fine. - Okay. Well, what would you like to talk about? Is there another topic of conversation? - Yeah. We can talk about anything you like besides that. How's that? Alright. I have this friend. Her name's Lesley. And she's dying... You're such a dick. You want to walk home right now? Yeah, I'd love to walk home. - Okay, great. I'll pull over. I'll pull here right on the side of this fuckin' bridge. Pull over on the side of the freeway. Oh wow. Wow, this is cool. This is my favorite spot. Did you make this? Yes, I did. With Winston. Yeah, yeah. It's really something. Come check it out. You got some wild flowers here? Exactly. Very smart. Wow. This is my spiral of herbs. Yeah. Smell that. You have some mint here. You can chew it. But what is this? Thai Basil. We have two different types of basil. I noticed a... "For Sale" sign out front. Yeah. There's one out there. How long you had it on the market? A few months. So as long as the... - Yep. As long as that. Well, we don't have to... It just adds up to too much. I mean, we originally moved out here so we could buy a bigger house. The yard... Have kids, that whole thing, but... at this point... long time removed from that point. Just got to sell the house before the bank can foreclose on it. But don't mention anything to Winston. He'd kill me if he knew I was telling people things. Oh no, no. No. Your secret's safe with me. You've never bought your own fucking pack of cigarettes. You always bum off of everybody. That's true. You always bum cigarettes. Can you put my window down? Do you want me to smoke your fuckin' cigarette for you too? Please, I could... - Jesus. Ruth. Just saying, dude. So, is there anyone special in your life? Charlie. There are a few special people in my life. You know? I'm a fucking single girl. That's so kinky. That is hot. - Tell me about it. I want to hear about it. I got divorced, actually, last year. I was going to invite you to the wedding, but... That'd be a little awkward with Winston. I was kind of surprised to get a call from him. I thought he hated me. No, he doesn't hate you. He just... had concerns. Concerns? Concerns. Well... Why'd you get divorced? Why'd I get married to that crazy bitch? That's more of the question. I don't know. I think when you get older, you just... have a harder time fitting your life into somebody else's, and you just... stop trying, you know? It's like... Of course, it doesn't help if... you have in the back of your mind, getting back together with someone. Hmm. You know, I always thought that. I'm glad you like Winston. Possibly, that maybe... All of this is because of money? Lack thereof? I don't think it's because of money, but I'm sure they're not... doing well. Lucy and I lent them money about a year ago, during the shit, and they... Yeah, I remember that. They never paid you back. They never paid us back. - Yeah. We did the same thing. Never got paid back. Tonight's probably not the best night to bring it up. I don't know. Maybe it's the perfect night to bring it up. The last thing I would want is for them to need it, and be afraid to bring it up. Yeah, but you can't... if you do, just don't ask in front of Leigh, because they're both so fuckin' proud. Just some gigs here and there. Nothing permanent. I'm... I'll start things, and they always seem to fizzle out. I've got a new rule though. What's that? That is, no more guys with wives or girlfriends in the band... or boyfriends, for that matter. It just always, always, ALWAYS gets in the way. Yay! You're back. Yay! We're back. What's going on? What have you guys done to my wife? Oh, shut up, Charlie. You're so annoying sometimes! Have you checked on our son lately? Has she checked on our son? I'm going to check on our son, alright. You just stay here. Thank you. Alright, whose is this? First present. They're beautiful. I love them. How do I look? You look beautiful, baby. But do you LOVE them? I LOVE them. From you, brother. Oh. It's in November. What? You can exchange them if you want. I thought you liked the ballet. I do. You sure? Thank you. Hey, Ruth. Where's your present? My present was being here tonight. And it's a great present. Thank you. But at my birthday, get me a REAL present, okay? You could at least get her a scarf. It's literally the least you could have done. Fuck the both of you. That reminds me. I have something I would like to give all of you. Just don't even say anything. Okay. Whoa. - Awesome. Mr. Blue Eyes. Did you make this yourself? - I did. With your own hands? - All of it. Thank you. - Very nice. - Merci. Ruth. Ruthless. Thanks for coming. Charlie. - Let's see it. Take care of that fucking baby. Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me? - It's my baby now. Charlie, I think it's less French and more Harriet Tubman. It's amazing. Let's see it. Oh shit. Thuggy thug in the house. Is it? Do I look kind of thug? - Look at this guy. It's totally thug. - I need to get a drink. Who needs a drink? I'll get it. Tequila? Total bank robber! It's a robbery. - It's a robbery! It's stylish. It's beautiful. It looks good. I love it. Thank you so much. - It's knit. You're welcome. Well, I get it. But look at that, I mean... I see it. Yeah. It's amazing. Just great colors. - It's beautiful. You can really pick excellent colors. Yeah, you look good in that. Alright. Well, thank you for all of your great presents. And thank you for coming. I think you are all just wonderful people. And I'm having such a good time. We are too. Happy birthday, Leigh. We love you, Leigh. So... Did you tell Mom and Dad about your... ...situation? - Yeah. - And? And... nothing. They're fine. Bullshit. You didn't tell them anything. I told them what I wanted them to know. Should I not have told you? Yeah, you should have told me. Just not this way. I don't know what I'm going to do... ...if you go. Do you hate me? No. No. I'm so sorry... that I tried to drown you in the Witherspoons' pool. I don't care about that. I don't. Hey. Hey. Are you two okay? Yeah. Yeah. We're fine. We're just... talking. And everything's fine. Before we got sick, we used to go out a lot. We'd go to this pool hall, and stay out all night drinking and partying with friends. It was right by my place, so we'd just stumble home and sleep in. And I fell in love with Leigh. It's as easy as that. It was the best time of my life. But I swear, it all changed when we bought that fuckin' house. Like, right after we moved in, Leigh started to get sick. A lot. She'd get these headaches, almost every day. And we thought she had the flu. But it seemed to last forever, you know? And then she'd break out in night sweats. And then she started losing weight. What's wrong with you? Come here. What? And all of a sudden, the plan changed. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, doctor. Good to see you. - Nice to meet you. Thanks for being here today. - Yeah. They put her in the hospital the next day, and we ended up staying there for two months. The chemo wrecked her. She got pneumonia, she broke out in rashes, got these horrible sores on her mouth. And then she lost her hair. Watching her go through it was almost too much for me. And even though the cancer would go away for a while, it would always come back, worse than before, which meant that I had to get a second job. One night in particular, I remember, she called me on my cell, and she was freaking out, and she was crying so hard, I couldn't understand what she was saying. I finally got her to calm down. She said she was sorry for doing this to me, and that she was so afraid. I said to myself, that I was in this situation, because I loved her. And it wasn't a sacrifice, because I couldn't help but do it. You've got to give her a lot of support. You've got to hang in there. How's it going with you? - Alright, man. Even when I was too tired, I would stay with her in the hospital, because I was scared it would hurt her feelings if I didn't. When her cancer finally went into remission, her doctor said she should get a transplant to stop it from coming back. But our HMO said they wouldn't cover a transplant. They said... They said my policy didn't cover the experimental procedure, which they estimated would cost us... $150,000. "If you can't tell me what it is, I don't have to pay for it." You want to play that game? So I did something uncomfortable, and begged my family for money. Thanks a lot, guys. But the handouts weren't near enough. I'm sorry! I don't want anything anymore! So we refinanced our mortgage, and I applied for every credit card and piece of financial aid I could get my hands on. Why are you yelling at me? I'm not hungry anymore! - Leave me alone! You came to me and you said you were hungry, so I'm in there fuckin' cooking for you! How am I supposed to be hungry? How am I supposed to want to eat when you're yelling and cussing and throwing things? I was COOKING, and then you said, "I don't want that!" I DON'T UNDERSTAND! Fuck you. No, no, no. FUCK YOU! - Fuck you. What the fuck do you want me to do? I was trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat, man. And I did. I fuckin' did it. We paid for the surgery that we couldn't afford. And it didn't work. But I don't care. I don't. We're in so deep, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters. ...except Leigh and me. And that's what bothers me, because there is a time coming when she won't be around, and I will be left alone, to deal with what is left of me... Hey. Hey! Little help? Coming. What's going on? Let's move her over there. You want to carry her? - Yeah. I've done it before. Let me... get her feet? - Yeah. You've never done this before? - Yeah. I mean... Weren't you in a frat, man? - No, I wasn't. Watch that. Watch the door. Putting her on the bed? - Yeah. There you go. All out the window. Dude, once, once Lucy got pregnant, did you guys... You know, did you guys sit down and discuss alternatives? Beau, he can hear you, okay? I'm holding him right now. Can you not discuss his murder? You'll give him a complex. He doesn't understand anything. Take that away from him. He absolutely knows.... Okay, come here. ...that I'm his dad. I just don't know what else he knows. Come here, buddy. Oh shit. Why... why the curiosity? Jake, is Sue pregnant? No, she's not pregnant. I was just curious how you guys, you know... I was just wondering how it all worked. Well, when a man and a woman love each other... Slow down. You got to start over. No, I mean, I wasn't like... planning on making Herbert when I was fucking my wife one night, but... You know, I hadn't been wearing condoms, and she wasn't on the pill, so it's not like it was a... I heard he's a little miracle. Yeah, uh oh. Come here. Hey, Leigh. Is it a private moment? Hey. - What's up? The guys and I were... talking in the back area, and we were wondering if you had any... Dominos. - Dominos. ...if we could play dominos. Sure. You want to play with us? Can I play? - Yes, of course! Yes. - You must. Dominos. Right this way, gentlemen. I didn't know you could dance like that. Morris needed a little love. Yeah. You know what? It means you've had too much to drink. We need coffee. Coffee is a good idea. - Coffee. Okay. We'll make some coffee. My head... Wine is so good. Can you walk a straight line? Not if pressured. - Yeah? Hey guys. We're going to make some coffee. You want some? I'm good. - Yeah. - Okay! Hey, I want some whiskey in mine. Of course. Do you think they have any, like cinnamon or honey, or... Oh yeah. I've got honey right here. Just show me what you got. Show me what you've got. You know your way around this place. I used to come over a lot, you know. When Leigh first got sick. Stay and make them dinner. She was in no condition, and Winston was working a lot. So... We can't play. - Right. It's established at this point. WHAT! You know, I was watching them tonight. They... They seem really connected. And I just can't imagine... what he's going through. And I can't imagine her going through this without someone like him. Well, she's lucky. She's got a really good support system. 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 7... 11. Oh! How about that! - Yeah. You want some coffee? Sure. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. I just needed a few minutes out here to clear my head. By myself. You want me to go? No. You're okay. Come on. So did you tell anyone else besides me about tonight? Nope. I didn't think she was going to do it like that. Oh yeah? How do you think all that went? Okay, I guess. Well, you know Leigh. I do know Leigh. But I didn't know you were planning on selling the house. Well, we owe more to the bank than it's worth. If we could sell it... That'd really help us out, but we haven't had any luck yet. On top of that, we can't afford to put anything else into the house to make it more sellable. And on top of that, it's not really what Leigh wants to be doing right now. Which I totally fuckin' get. Well, that sucks. Can I tell you something? I don't know how... I don't know how we would've gotten through all this... ...without you. I don't know how I would've gotten through it. And I just wanted to say thank you. Come here. I think about you all the time. I'm sorry. I have to get the... I'm sorry. Oh yeah! 15, bitches! You're kidding me! When are you guys going to start playing? Alright. You guys can feel free to jump in at any time. Okay, here we go. - Hey. Look who's at the party. You're smoking, Charlie. I didn't think this was going to be an issue. I want to go home. What? - Now. You sure you don't want some coffee? - No. I'm doing very well. Jake and I are doing very well today. Just finish this game. I want to go home now. Will you just... - I'm tired. I don't feel good. We just got a call that there are checkpoints everywhere, and my alcohol level now is probably not... - Charlie. He's a lawyer. He knows. It's not wise. It's not prudent. - Come on. Let's go. Okay, I'm good... - Play, play, play something good. Charlie, shut up and get out of your fucking chair, and let's go home. F bombs are out! We're going home! Hi, baby Herbert! Thank you guys so much for dinner. - You're welcome. Thank you for coming. - Thank you for coming. It was different. - Did you like it? Yes. Come here, baby Herbert. Say goodbye! Goodbye, bye. - Bye Herbert. - Bye! Bye. And happy birthday. - Bye. Bye, Winston. Let me stay for another half an hour. THE BABY HAS LEFT THE BUILDING! I want to go home. Let's have a real party, y'all. Time to get loose. Are you okay to drive? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Why don't you want to stay? Jake, I have to be up early in the morning. I'm tired. I am so tired. - Okay. Okay. I'll meet you back at the house. Okay. Oh no. Not you too. You guys leaving? - She is. I'm just walking her out. Thank you, guys. - Of course. Thank you guys so much. - Thanks for coming. Sorry. Seriously. What if you miss your yoga class tomorrow morning? Just this once? What would happen? I don't want to miss just this once. Okay. I meant it when I said I was tired. I thought I was coming for dinner. I didn't plan on getting coked up and wasted with you and your friends. Okay. Alright. Let me ask you a question. Why did you come out here tonight? If you so obviously don't give a FUCK about any of this, why did you even come out here? You know who my friends are. - Okay. Right? You know who they are. I've had enough. - Oh you've had enough. Okay. Well, guess what? I've had enough of you. Alice. YOU SELFISH BITCH! FUCK YOU! You want to go outside and bum me a smoke? I'm sure I'm going to regret saying this tomorrow morning. But... for a while now, I've been suspecting that she's fucking somebody she works with. Really? - Yeah. For the past... maybe even six weeks, two months. I've definitely felt that way. With who? I don't know. I don't really know the people she works with that well. We have this... I mean, there's a few things, but... We have this office... She's got an office in her study. And it's like, all marked up with shit, you know. Phone calls and appointments, and it's all like, you know, pretty neatly organized, with people and their contact information, whatever, where the fuck they're meeting... But every now and then, it just says "Lunch." You know? No other information. No phone number. No place for where they're having lunch. Just fuckin' lunch. You know? And it's like, you know, 3-4 times a month. Just fuckin' sprinkled in there. You know? Well, have you brought it up with her, or...? No, because I'm not sure. And I'm scared. And I don't want her... ...to see that I'm sort of jealous, I guess. Just petty. Do you guys still have sex, or...? No. Not really. Shoes off! Shoes off! That way, Winston doesn't get mad. Where are you going? We're not done yet! Get up here! Are you okay? - I'm tired. She's fine. Okay. You okay? Yeah. I'm great. Yeah. Now you guys are broken up like... and got back together at least... I don't know. Four, five, six times? Right? It's not six. Four, tops. Okay. Have you initiated every time? No. Is this the first time you're initiating? No, I think we're even. We're two and two, which means we have balance. We can both move on. Which means you need a tie breaker. You need to get back together one more time. A tie breaker. Let's see which one of us wins. I'm going to fly solo for a little while. I can poison my own cat. ...so to speak. Where's Leigh? She's in the living room. There's a dance party. What are you doing? Put your hand on Morrison's shoulder. I checked them into a hotel! I don't know what this does. I don't know what this does. Did you go to the black market or something? I was in China. Use only under close adult supervision. - Hey, it's dancing time. Wait. Wait. I wouldn't leave my fuckin' baby with a passed out woman. That's ridicu... I also told the front desk. I was like... "If you hear a baby crying..." "Could you please check on that shit?" What would you do with a drunken sailor? What would you do with a drunken sailor? What would you do with a drunken sailor? Who gave Morris the guitar? Hey, hey, up she rises. Hey, hey, up she rises. Hey, hey, up she rises, early in the morning. What the fuck is going on here? Timber. Are you guys hooking up tonight? - Okay. Don't lie. - Meh. - Are we okay here? No, we're fine. - No, we're not. We are not. I heard a cool story about whales. The more it diverts... - The more action? - Those were the days. The more it diverts from the standard... Yes, exactly. Exactly! The more unfamiliar, yet pleasing harmonically... The more... Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just need to get some fresh air. How much have you had to drink? - A lot. Where's he going? He's... - Hey! Wait up! Morris, wait. - That's not the bathroom. Dude, spin around really fast. It helps! - Fine. Where's he going? Fuckers. Don't make out with him! I'll try really hard. We know your reputation. Did you ever make out with her? Ruth? I tried so hard. - When? That was a joke. - Happy birthday! That was so classy. - I know. Who are you? What have you become? Married, a lawyer. Start your own musketeers. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. I got this really sweet weed. Hold on. Hold on right here. I'm going to show you this really sweet weed. You don't really have weed. - He doesn't. It's something else. - What does he have? This is all a ruse. All a ruse. Even better. - No! No! Winston. - That's fuckin' awesome. Don't do it, Winston. Don't do it. OH SHIT. Don't do it! I hope nobody cares we're sitting on their lawn. We'll be gone before they're any the wiser. What kind of people do you think live in this neighborhood? I don't know. People afraid of the city. People afraid of black people. My sister and my brother in law. Here. I could never live in a place like this. I know. It feels so fuckin' detached from the rest of the world. Like earlier, when we went to the store with Jake... It took us 10 minutes to get there. It's a tragedy. What ever happened to walking to the corner store? YES! - YEAH! Success! Hold on, hold on... End of the table is the line and it's right here right now. Alright, there are no rules in Duck Hunt, alright? Sure there is. Sure there are. That's why you have to get a license to hunt ducks. You're putting your fucking gun right up to the screen. What? What about the guests? Who cares? They can hear us. - I don't care. Are you sure? How long you staying for? I'm going to be here until Monday. My flight's in the afternoon, I think. Who are you staying with? Just some old girlfriends from college. Happy birthday, Leigh. The clusters of the nerves that love manifests itself in, is feelings festering doubt, will turn my stomach inside out. So when you going back to Houston? I don't know. I've just been thinking a lot about... you know, Leigh's thing, and... It's kind of got me thinking. About life and death. The universe. ...and having sex with me. Well... Not just that. I just wonder sometimes why, if I wanted something, if I really wanted something... Why would I... deny it to myself? ...little to do. This probably has little to do with you. If you want to take it personally, do, I guess. No skin off my ass... Then do, I guess. It's no skin off my ass... Hey guys, want to go to the park and-- I'm sorry. We're going to go to the park if you want to go. Sorry. Let's go. It's... That was awkward. Was it? It's getting a little late. It's not that late. I feel like I should go. I'm not used to staying out all night. Well, thanks for... Thanks for all this. And if you need anything, you know... You okay to drive? Yeah. I'll get a motel. You're going to see me again. Okay, well... See you soon. Winston. - Maxwell. You realize you're a very lucky man. Yes, I do. Thanks again. 25... 27 dollars... if you ding dong ditch this house right here. That one right here. Didn't do it. Then you should take my 27 dollars. Where do you want me to set this? - You're a lawyer. You ... Set the goal up? - So the goal of the slam dunk contest is... You killed my father. You killed my father. - I'm your father! You tried to fucking kill me. - Yeah, fuck you. You're not my fuckin'... I'm your dad! - Fuck you! It's going to be okay. I remember when the doctor first told me. It was like I... - The results show that you have... ...you have leukemia. - I couldn't... process it. ...acute myelogenous leukemia. We need to tackle this right away. Honestly, I don't really remember much of what he said after that. Pain... Money... Winston... What was going to happen to him? We were supposed to start a family together. I thought of everything I did to stay healthy. You know, like yoga... sunscreen... eating right... None of it mattered. I keep thinking about how I got it. Like... if I had done something differently in my life, could I have avoided it? Even if it had been my own fault, like something that resulted from my own stupidity, I think I might not feel so robbed. Anyone who's healthy... can't have any idea what I'm talking about. When I wake up in the morning, It's the first thing on my mind. There's a hill to climb, and you just have to climb this hill. I don't know if you're a runner or not. Is this really what my life is supposed to be like? Sometimes, I wish I could just get in my car, and drive away from all of this. Away from the disease, away from the debt... Everything. I actually tried to one day when Winston was at work. I just... ...couldn't turn the key. I thought of Winston. I know it sounds terrible, but sometimes he makes this big show about how much he helps me, and how much he's given up and how tired he is all the time. And in those moments, I just wish he would SHUT UP and leave me alone. Yeah. I know this whole thing fucked you over, but what about me? Could you really ever think I did this to you? On purpose? I've told Alice that I want my funeral to be held in some field in the middle of nowhere. And... I want them to bury me under a tree. I just hope that there's more to death than... ...endless sleeping. Or, if it is only that, then I hope it's endless dreaming too. These days, with the energy I have left, I try to concentrate more on how warm the sun feels, or how good something tastes. Death... ...scares me to my core. And I don't want to feel this... ...anguish any more. I just want it to end. I don't care how. Was it the best birthday ever? It was the best damn birthday ever. It was fun. I think everybody had, well... I think a lot of people had fun. I think everyone had fun. The cake? Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm ready. Okay. Let me get you out. On three? - Count to three. Alright, one... two... three. Tired? Thank you. You're welcome. Happy birthday. Want me to put you in bed? Come on. Kick em, kick em, kick em! Here we go. Are you comfortable? Yeah.
