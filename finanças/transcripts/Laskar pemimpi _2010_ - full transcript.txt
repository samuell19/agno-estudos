The Troop of Dreamers Indonesia, 1948 After the proclamation of independence, the Dutch joined with the Allied Forces. They repeatedly tried to seize our sovereignty. They succeeded in conquering Djakarta, the capital of the Republic. Karno then moved the seat of government of the Republic. The struggle continues. Pandjen, Central Java Hey! Hah, crickets. How steep is the path My nation struggles Many souls have been lost already The river of tears continues to flow Bring together hope to survive There will be an answer Why should all this happen? Does this sacrifice have meaning? Freedom! Come on! Welcome the name of the killed Rise, my brother I'm not willing to let you be destroyed We are one heart You are in doubt Do not give up Chase your dream Together, we can Should we fall We will stand Rise, my Indonesia Freedom! Well? Have you thought about my proposal? - I have. - And? My dad says I can get married. But not to you. What! How come your father never supports the cause? My father supports the cause. But he said... I'm better off married to a Gurkha than to a playboy like you. That's crazy! Your father said that? Yuk, tell your father. If you marry me... and when our country is really free from invaders,... we'll be given a housing facility. - Really? - Yes! But will they take away the house later on? Of course not! Okay, let's just elope! You're used to guerrillas, right? - But... - But what now? I don't want to marry before my older sister. Who? Wiwid? Oh no... No one like her! She has a really sharp tongue. Well, I don't want to marry if Wiwid isn't married yet. Hey, Yuk! Damn! Yayuk! She disappears really fast. Yuk... Wid... Wiwid! The Residence of RM Surjo Menggolo Jogjakarta He's calling for you. Move faster. If you weren't my wife's favourite maid,... I'd have sent you back to Pandjen. Do you understand? Excuse me, Sir. My decision is final. You must study in Leiden, the Netherlands. At Queen Juliana's almamater. - But, Sir... - This is my final decision. If you want to be smart, join the Dutch. If you want to be a moron, join the Republic. Like Wiwid. Well? Damn, it's broken. Why does a nobleman like to look at a maid's backside? Oh no! I... That is... I... I'd like to take my leave, Wid. You're leaving? Where to? For my studies. To Leiden, the Netherlands. The Netherlands? Study what? How to burn villages? Or how to bring about conflict? Or how to peek at a maid's backside correctly? Wid! Wid, just because you're my mother's favourite,... don't talk like that! Anyway, I'm going to Leiden to study fashion design. Listen to me. Why would you go far away to Leiden? It's better to go to Pandjen. Join Captain Hadi's troops. That's more useful for our country... instead of learning to be a coloniser. I'm not going there to be a coloniser. I'm going to study! To study to be smart! Being smart is good! It's important! Yes, Sir. When you're smart, you'll realise you have your own country. That's also important. Wid, you can speak Dutch! Why didn't you say anything? I can also fart. But why should I tell you? December 19, 19466.30 am Maguwo, Jogjakarta - Are you going to the market? - Yes. - I'm going now. - Yes, thank you.

Yes, Captain. - Just because my face is handsome. - Yes. - You keep saying that... - Very handsome, Captain. Just because he's the second cousin of Colonel Bambang Sugeng's wife's in-law. He's arrogant! Mr. Know-it-All! - Hey, Wo. - Yes. - How many people do we have? - We have 27, Captain. There are 27. Okay, you go to Pandjen now.

Hey, over here. - Cricket! - Come on, Wo. Ready! Hi, Surjo. Wid, where are you going? It's just as I thought. The master is a spy for the Netherlands! I can't stay here anymore. I want to go home to Pandjen. I'm going to tell the Republic army that the master is a spy for them! Wid! Wid! Wid! The story of a country In the days of old It was green and prosperous Rich, fertile, bountiful But suddenly comes a powerful giant Destroying the country Encouraging conflict here and there The giant laughed He was happy for making the people Become miserable My brothers and countrymen in general,... and Pandjen residents in particular,... today... - those Dutch dogs... - Sir, I object! - What is it? - Please, sir. I have lots of dogs at home. Is there a land of dreams? A land of fantasy? A land I crave? There is no war there No crime The people are safe and peaceful They give Today, those Dutch cats... - Oh my God, sir, ask for forgiveness! - What now? Cats are the Prophet's favourite animals. Forgive me, God. I'll repeat that. My brothers, today,... - those Dutch snakes... - Sir. What? Please, sir. Even though snakes are venomous, their meat is good... for heart disease medicine. - It's also for cholesterol. - That's right! Fine! My brothers, today,... those Dutch... cunningly violated their agreement with this Republic. Two, three! To you, our country Today,... the motherland... calls us to join with Captain Hadi's army. Men and women of Pandjen whom I love,... I bring to you... the motherland's mandate for us all. Register your name with Corporal Jono to my left. Write your name, space, J-O-N-O. Jono! Freedom or death! - Freedom! - Freedom! Yuk... - Yayuk. - Wiwid. - Yayuk! - Oh my God. My sister! Where have you been? I was looking for you. I haven't been anywhere. Yuk, Jogja has just been bombed! - You're okay? - Yeah. Excuse me, Miss. What's all the commotion? People are signing up to fight for the Republic. Can women join? In Captain Hadi's troops, women can join. Okay then. Thank you, Miss. - Wid... - You again. Are you a girl or a dolphin? You move really fast. What? Who?

I don't want to... This young master's father... I don't want to! He's a spy... Go! Hurry! Now! He's signing up! You're over there. Who are you? Name? I'm Wiwid's boyfriend. Wiwid's boyfriend. Independent Indonesia Independent It's our right Forever Freedom! Headquarters of Pandjen Troops Freedom! Everyone, line up! Line up here! Half right dress! Eyes front! At ease! - I'm Hadi Sugito. - I'm Sri Mulyani, sir. Sri! No bluff! I repeat, I'm Hadi Sucipto. - I'm Ahok. - Tumino. I didn't ask for your names one by one. You Sri, you Parjo, you Teno. Whatever. You should listen first. I'm Hadi Sugito, your captain. Congratulations in joining with the most feared troop in... The common kitchen. All of you, listen. The most feared in the common kitchen. - This is your army, Di? - Yes, why? What do you want, Gus? Enough with the small talk. My schedule is full today. - Let's go inside! - Hey, hey. I'm a major. Address me correctly. Ready! I came to deliver instructions of the divisional commander,... which was ordered directly by the great commander. Wait... Firman is from your place? You could have said so. I want to ask for a photo and to meet with him. No. An officer like you can't ask for photos casually. He moves around a lot lest he gets caught by the enemy. Instructions from Colonel Bambang Sugeng. All troops of the army are to immediately coordinate... and carry out sporadic attacks... against the population and facilities of the Dutch army. That's easy, Gus. You're still so arrogant, Di. This is just bait to divide the Dutch forces. By doing an onslaught in various places,... they are forced to widen their troops. They'll be spread thinner. And what if their power is spread thin? Here. There will be a massive attack, which is currently being designed. But remember, this is still top secret. Wait for the day. Nice. Wo. Jono. - Ready. - Ready. A chance to really prove our quality has arrived. - So, Wo... - Yes, ready, Captain. Starting tomorrow, you train these new soldiers. As much as possible. No unnecessary holidays. Ready! - Captain. - Yes? It's the last night. Before these soldiers fight all out, isn't it better that tonight... we allow them to go home to Pandjen? Okay, but don't make a scene. Don't attract the attention of KNIL. Ready! - Peek-a-boo. - Peek-a-boo. - Let's go over there. - Okay. Where is Corporal? Not the corporal! Tumino! Hey, Tumino. Come on! Can I borrow this? Thank you. Alright! Hey! Hey, ladies, don't ignore me Because I think no one wants me I want to play music to be cool My desk and chair are enough for me Hey, ladies, don't play hard to get Just because I'm not famous yet Listen to my music to be cool My desk and chair are enough for me Enough for me Enough for me I told you so My music makes you happy Even if you don't look You're rocking Just wait, darling I'll play it again If you just let loose Then you'll start rocking Why are you still embarrased You pretend not to be interested But you've been sneaking a look Hey, who said I'm embarrassed Hey, when I move, I'm sexy Hey, this is fun Let's do it one more time Hey, who said I'm embarrassed Hey, when I move, I'm sexy Hey, this is fun Let's do it one more time Let's do it Hey, who said I'm embarrassed Those stupid Republicans will all be dead tonight. Lieutenant, is there no other way? Hey, when I move, I'm sexy Hey, this is fun Let's do it one more time Hey, who said I'm embarrased Hey, when I move, I'm sexy Hey, this is fun We try diplomacy? Let's ask them to give up. Sure. Can I also invite them to the cinema? That's a better ide, Lieutenant. Let's do it Ouch! Hello! - Who's there? - Hello too. - I'm Once. - Hey, Once! Hello, Once. Greetings. I'm Sri. Greetings to you too, Sri. Once... Once, what are you doing there? Aren't you afraid, being alone? I'm not alone. I'm with the other KNILs. What? KNIL? Bastard! You took my father! Sri, wait! Hey! Wow! She's crazy! That had to hurt. Everyone, fall back! Captain Hadi! Captain Hadi! I survived! Captain Sergeant... Report! - Report, Corporal! - No! Over there. Report, Corporal. I failed to secure the citizens. There were many of them. - There were 200... - Five. Who was kidnapped? Yes. Who? Ngadiman and Paidi. - I'm Ngadiman. - And I'm Paidi. How did you guys escape? Are you blind? That's not it! The kidnapped ones are... Who are they? Yayuk and Wiwid. It's them. Yayuk! Wiwid! No! Oh my God! I already warned you. Do not attract the enemy's attention! Now our secret base might be found out. Because of you guys. Who among you... had the idea of making a tortoise? - Making a scene, stupid! - That's what I meant, Captain. Who was it? - Joni? - Jono, sir. That's what I meant, stupid! Stupid. You! You're surely the culprit! How many more times should I downgrade your rank? Permission to speak, Der! Der? It's "commander"! Sir, even though tonight we lost,... we managed to catch a KNIL soldier. Mama... Yes. A stupid KNIL soldier! He can't tell the difference between me and his mother. Listen up. Because of your stupidity, two of our citizens have been kidnapped. Well, that's it, Captain. I'm also confused. Why did KNIL capture residents... that have no strategic value? - What's their plan? - Yes, sir. My father was also kidnapped by the same troops. Lullaby This person... If you don't sleep Mosquitoes will bite you Is there no other way to interrogate, Captain? Do you have any other ideas? Sri's punch gave this KNIL a concussion. Look at him. He keeps coming in and out of consciousness. It's useless. Physical torture won't work. Yes, Captain. Toar. Hurry. Crickets... Over here. That's enough singing. Once... Hush now. My darling... Mommy's boy... Yes, Mommy. You're a good kid, right? Smart kid. Tell Mommy. Who kidnapped those villagers? Mama, Mama... - Feed me first! - No! Give him some. - Give him some. - Once. If you tell Mommy,... then I'll nurse you. Mommy, General Von Zahlen... needs slaves for his plantation. Captain, please. Sir, I'm sorry. But we have to send troops, sir. To save them, sir. Yes, sir! And how about my father? Please, sir. - Yes, sir. - Please, sir. All of you must understand. We are in a critical moment. Captain. Sir... Soon there will be an attack on Jogja on a large scale. And that's much more important. So if we act sloppy now,... our first strategy then will fail. But we are the army. We defend the people. That's right, sir. But that's just it. The key word is "the people". For the sake of defending the people, some residents should be sacrificed. Sir... Sir. Sir... Sir Corporal, what about my father? Here, to relieve your stress. - Go on. - Is it still warm? It's delicious. Hey! You Dutch dog! You traitor of the nation! No. No! Wake up! Where's the Dutchman? The three of us are going to free Wiwid, Yayuk, and my father. Do you want to come? - Does Captain Hadi know? - Of course not! Do we know where they're being held? Let's take Once and ask him to tell us where the headquarters is. Oh my God. You have to be careful. They might think we've deserted. I don't want to. We could be executed. Or hanged! But we can travel around. Like a tour. Well? - A tour? - Yeah! Come on! Come on! Come on! Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! KNIL! KNIL! - KNIL! - Nonsense. Look again! - You want me to shoot you? - Sorry, Corporal! Ready! Hey, KNIL. Our position is here. Right? Now you show me. Come on, answer him. Sir, I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, Sir. - I can't talk! - Where? Hurry! Here! That's far! - Are you sure it's there? - Yes, Uncle! I'm sure! Sir, excuse me. We're talking to a KNIL, sir. Maybe this is his trap. Be careful, sir. Hey, KNIL. You're not lying, are you? No lies. If I lie, I go to hell. It's safe. He says he's not lying. Yes, ready, sir. As the highest officer here,... I decide we go straight to the target spot. - Ready! - Just a minute, sir. If we walk, it will take a month, sir. That's a given. - Yes, I know. - Yes, Sir Corporal. Let's look for a ride so we can quickly get there and sleep. Yes, sir. - As the highest officer here,... - Ready. I also think so. - The trick is to... - How, sir? Well? I have an idea. What if someone... spies on the Dutch's patrol path? And after that, we immediately attack. And we hijack their jeep. - Shut up! - Ready. - I have an idea. - Ready! We watch the Dutch patrol path. We ambush them, then we take their jeep! One! Two! Come on, again! - One! Two! - Three! Hey, with gusto! Six of your soldiers deserted. One of your captives disappeared. Two residents you should have protected have been kidnapped by the Dutch. Which side are you really on? Seriously, since our time in PETA, you always make trouble. If so,... sorry. I have to report this to the brigade commander. No, Gus. Overste Soeharto is busy. Wait until he's not so stressed out. But if your stupid men make a riot at the KNIL headquarters,... all our big plans will fail. If so, never mind Sir Harto, even Sir Dirman can also react. Corporal, are you sure this is the most appropriate hiding place? Don't doubt me. I'm the highest officer here. Excuse me, gentlemen. If want to ambush the Dutch, please do it over there. This is where I keep my ducks. Their path is over there. And if you can, please do the shootings after three. After my ducks have lunch. Okay? - Come on, sir. - I told you so. God... Wiwid, stop cleaning. Forget about being a maid for a while. This is jail. Yuk, you shouldn't be lazy. If you want to have your own country, everyone should have a role. Be proactive. What does sweeping have to do with independence? Well, if our home is clean,... then our soul will also be clean. If our soul is clean,... God willing, our prayers to have our own country... will be granted! By God. Anyway, there's a chance we will all die here. You want your final resting place to be like this? I don't want to die, Sister! Hey, Yuk! Maybe we can still be saved. By whom? My boyfriend, Jono. And also Udjo. He obviously has a crush on you. What... God. Listen. If they're to be our saviour, it's obvious we'll all die here! Where are they? It sounds close. Oh my God... - Sri! - Sri! I actually don't like being a KNIL. - And? - But my income is quite good. For my mother's treatment back at the village. What is she suffering from? Famine. He can see. He can! Hey! Come on! Move! No wonder we easily got Jogja. You Republicans are all stupid and lazy! You want to ambush the patrol, but you sleep like ducks... Don't involve the ducks! Our ducks are smarter than your ducks! Excuse me. Freedom! Forgive me. Watch out! Watch out! Freedom! Take their rifles. Captain Drajat from Siliwangi. This is an incredible tactic. No victims, no injuries. But successful! Really incredible! What? Thank you, Captain. We've eaten. I'd just like to remind you of our secret mission, sir. Captain. Coincidentally, we're on a special mission. We'd like to ask for permission to use the jeep we just caught. Oh, please, go ahead. Thank you. I don't like anything sour. - Can we? - Please. Go ahead. Someone can drive the jeep, right? Drive the jeep. All you young people, and no one can drive a jeep? - I can drive - I can't I'm different Different from you I love the wind - Uh, she's sleeping - Sri! I'm different Different from you Let's go to the left to get there fast I want to go right Many food stalls - Sir, I'd like to ask a question - Sir, I'd like to ask a question Although we are different We are always together I I'm different Different from you I I'm different Different from you - Everyone, let's work. - Let's take a break. Hey, the car! - Hey, come back! - Let's go! I'm different Different from you Let's go back Pick up friends - Hey, what's up? - The car broke down. - God! - You... Colonel Bambang Sugeng Military Governor/3rd Division Commander Men, we've received instructions. The counterattack against Jogja must be immediately carried out. - Harto. - Ready. Can you lead the attack? Ready. I will do it. This attack will prove to the United Nations... that Indonesia still exists. The great commander and the Sultan has cautioned... that we musn't fail. Our attack must be successful. - Excuse me, gentlemen. - Excuse me, Sir. We'd like to ask... Oh my God! What is it, sir? You're soldiers, too? Who are you people? From which unit? Excuse me, Sir. We're from Captain Hadi's army, sir. Hadi Sugito? - Ready. - Ready. Right, sir. You guys are Pandjen Troops? - Right. - Ready. Right, sir. That Hadi... He's left his troops wandering around. - Hey, you guys are attacking Jogja? - Once... The east sector. The south sector is the weakest. The western sector is strong. Hey, soldier! Don't go crazy if the boss is talking. I'm not a soldier. I'm... - That's enough! - Be quiet, Ce. If you're not a soldier, then don't talk. If he's not a soldier,... .. how does he know the Dutch defense conditions? Sir, he's psychic. - Yes, sir. - That's enough. Now, I command you to go back to headquarters. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! This situation is urgent. - Freedom. - Freedom! The western sector, the strong sector... Once! Excuse me, Sir. Ouch, where is the gasoline? - Harto. - Ready. Find out whether that psychic had the right information. Okay, sir. If the west sector is indeed considered the most powerful,... I myself will lead the attack there. - Do it. - Ready. - Freedom. - Freedom! Sir. We've walked for more than an hour. Where do you want to look for gasoline? Please. Don't doubt my leadership, huh? Sir Corporal, why don't we just take the new jeep? Sri, you think catching the Dutch patrol is like catching mosquitoes? - God. - Back then,... we would have been dead if not for Siliwangi Troop. Hey! I mean that jeep, that one! Hey, Once! Get down! Friends. I forgot, this is my headquarters. KNIL Headquarters. - That means Yayuk is inside. - Wiwid too. - My dad too? - Yeah. Let's just attack now. We beat them up! We burn them! Why is everyone crazy? We are seven people, against one platoon. We can't win. But that's good. We are seven, they are one. Tum, one platoon is 30 KNIL. What! If so, does anyone have Siliwangi Troop's phone number? Quiet. Under these conditions, we have to be smart. Yes, Sir. - I have an idea. - What? Let's pray. - Oh my God. - Ask for directions. What's wrong with all of you? I'm KNIL, right? I can enter without suspicion. I'll open the cell, and let that prisoner out. It's no bother. Yeah, that's good. Yes, that's what I meant. Once! Where have you been? Ready, Lieutenant. I was held by Republicans. But I was released because... Because of what? Because... Because I eat a lot! Makes sense. Alright. You're back on duty. Ready, Lieutenant. But, Once... Can you explain why your uniform is like that? Please, Lieutenant. - I... - You what? I hate bathing. Tell me where your Republican friends are! They're... Where? They're... - Where? - They... Where? - On the radio, I heard... - Nonsense! Where is he? Maybe he betrayed us. Impossible. - It's possible. Why not? - No. - Once. - Once. - Stay calm. - Sir, be patient. Keep a level head. Where are your Republican friends? You traitor. I'm... not a traitor. Then what? I'm... an Indonesian soldier. Where are your Republican friends? I'm... an Indonesian soldier. You... Any last requests? Five more minutes, Mama. Private Once Sahuleka. By the power given to me... by the supreme leader of the Dutch army,... I hereby execute you. Aim. One. Two. Stop! How reckless! Who's the leader here? I'm the leader here. - You, huh? - Yes, me. Hold on. What is this? Go ahead. - What's your name, huh? - Johan Kuyt. Lieutenant Kuyt. It's like this, Kiut... - Kuyt! - Ah, whatever. We are from the legal mafia task force... formed by Queen Juliana for the Dutch East Indies. Let me introduce you. My name is Margugum Sirajagukguk. Okay. My assistant, Tikem Panggabean. Greetings. And one more, Marudjo Situoke. Okay. Hey. Greetings. And we represent Margugum Assotaciates. Associates! Ah, you. - That's it. - That's my name. It seems that there is the practice of legal mafia. Therefore, I want the prisoner released. Tikam, let's go. Release him. - This one? - Yes. But I don't believe Her Majesty the Queen formed a legal task force. You talk a lot. Hey! Don't bring him straight away. Poor guy. Take him to my room first. Let him rest. I guarantee that all procedures of torture... and the murder of prisoners here already meet the criteria of human rights. Please check. Oh, yes. For example, for the head covering ahead of the execution,... we use cloths with standard thickness. Please check this. - Here. - Sri, freedom! - Run! - Get them! Stay together! Slowly! Father! - Father! - You are under siege! - Surround them! - Come on, surround them! Father! I finally found you! You're okay, right? Move forward! - Hey! Congratulations. - You inside! It seems your rescue mission this time really works. - Are you being sarcastic, Wid? - Yes, of course! What do you think? Why are you always mean to me, Wid? - Because you are pro Dutch! - What pro Dutch? Don't you see who's pursuing me? You're just acting! Pretending! How could you, Wid. - A song? - Is there music? Where is it coming from? Where is it coming from? - How scary. - My ear... So many times I've told you of my love for you I have spent so many years All your boyfriends have become exes And I still hope You give me a chance Here I am, a stupid man Always waiting to be your boyfriend - People say I'm stupid - Not me!

Who's there? Take that! Well? Well? I've lost my patience! Stop! Who's there? Lieutenant Bowo! Republic of Indonesia! Under pain of death! Please come in. All of you have besmirched the good name of this nation and country. You! You rice field snake. And you! I've downgraded your rank twice! This is the last one. You're fired from the army! This applies to all of you too! From now on, you are no longer soldiers of the Republic of Indonesia. Captain. Please reconsider, Captain. Everyone fought. What did you say? Reconsider? You want me to fire you too? Dismissed! Go back to your own villages! Go! Dismissed! Hey, you. Your weapon, here. Hurry! Hold this. Dismissed! Go! Hey, KNIL! Where are you going? Here! Kneel! You want to go home? You're a traitor. You must be imprisoned! I'm not a traitor. Once a traitor, always a traitor. You must be imprisoned. Take him! - Captain! - No, Captain! - Take him! - He's our friend, Captain! Take him! All of you, go! - Captain. - I'm sorry, Once. Once. Headquarters of Lieutenant Colonel Soeharto - Segorojoso, Bantoel - You guys are from Siliwangi? - Yes! Come with me. - Gus. Hadi. - Ready! - Toar. - Ready! Come here. I've decided on our attacks. - The first of March, at dawn. - Ready. You take the Pandjen men. Tomorrow we attack from the west sector. Ready, commander. According to reports from reliable intel,... the west sector will be very difficult to penetrate. - Your army is ready? - Ready, Major. The Pandjen Troop is ready. One more thing. We are composed of many entities and many areas. So we know each other,... I've decided that we should wear yellow leaves on our right arms. Okay. - Gus. - Ready. Tomorrow you brief Drajat and the Siliwangi men... - on your duties. - Ready, sir. Excuse me, sir. - Hadi. - Ready. Our attack tomorrow will be very decisive. Will we still have a country or not after it? So do it well. Ready, sir. General Attack March 1, 1949 - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - You again. - Yes, sir. Well? Why is this battle very far from Jogja, sir? The troops have special assignments. To block KNIL reinforcements... from defense posts in Semarang and Solo. - Really, sir? - But they didn't get there. They were intercepted by the Dutch. If the reinforcements come to Jogja, what will happen? The men in Jogja will have struggled in vain. Well then, my friends and I... will hold back the progress of the reinforcements, sir. - Freedom! - Freedom! - Shoot! - Where are you going? The Pandjen Troops are in Jogja. Calm down, boss. They are special forces from Pandjen. - Like an elite team. - Alright. Come on. - Let's go! Hurry! - Come on. Hey, your hand. - Hurry up. - Wait for me! - Just a little. - It's slippery. But I want to. - Once! - Once! - What's wrong? Were you tortured? - Did you have diarrhea? - Were you tickled? - Were you circumcised? - Where have you been? - Are you okay? Captain Hadi is cruel. - What is it? - What's wrong, Once? He didn't give me breakfast! - And here I thought... - Your habits! Once. There is something more important than breakfast. More important than breakfast? It must be lunch. No. - Toar. - Ready! From now on, you are an Indonesian soldier. - Ready! - Ready! - Once! - Once! - Once! - Freedom! - We won. - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Our spirit... - Hadi. Ready! Now our fate depends on Agus and Drajat. Whether they managed to hold back the Dutch in Semarang. We will see later. Report! Captain Drajat and Major Agus are still stuck in the Temanggung area. There is a sizeable concentration of Dutch troops there. This is bad. Who will hold back the KNIL troops? According to the info from Captain Drajat,... there is a special elite unit we have that will carry out the task. What elite unit? We have an elite unit? The Dutch convoy... we'll go hand in hand like a line of ducks. And according to the most reliable information from duck breeders,... there is a powerful way to disrupt the KNIL ranks. The trick is to scare just one duck... in the back. Because if there is one scared duck in the back,... and there was panic,... then the ducks in front will panic too... without knowing the actual cause of the panic. So if they're panicked, we just need time... to delay their journey to Jogja. For how long? For however long we can hold them. Because the seconds mean much to our friends in Jogja. But after that, what? If our mission is successful, is it important what's after that? No! Toxic gas! OMG! Oh my God! Be careful! - Look out! - Once! - Once! - Once! Once! Once! - Corporal! - Corporal! Shoot! Corporal, we're out of ammunition! I've run out of bullets! It's jammed! I have one more. Wid, please get it. In there. - Get it, Wid! - No! I'm not Yayuk! It's supposed to be for Yayuk. A birthday gift. - Hurry, get it. - Come on! - Hurry, Wid. - All of you, surrender! - Republicans! - A grenade! Pull him! Now what? Looks like they succeeded, Di. But I'm curious who they are, sir. The history of our struggle will decide, Di. Many of our fighters' names will be forgotten. These people, everyone who is involved with us,... Indonesia will be very thankful to them. Starting tomorrow, everything will depend on our children and grandchildren. Where will they take this country? - Freedom! - Freedom!
