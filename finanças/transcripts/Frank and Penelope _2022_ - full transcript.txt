So tell me, where are you newly weds headed? - Well, see, as a, as a wedding gift, my new husband, yeah, he's promised to take me down the prettiest road in the whole fuckin' world. - Oh well, you- - Well this is the wrong part of the world to find the prettiest road. - Yeah, it ain't in this stink hole. It's west. My baby here, he said that he saw it in some movie, uh, "Thelma & Louise." It's this road that they go down at the end of the movie, and my baby here, he's gonna take me for a ride. - Wow. What a generous and kind man you are. I've seen that movie. Amazing. To see two love birds about to take each other for a ride. You mind if I join you two? - Well only if you have a story. You know, seeing as how that's the rules and all. - Get us two. - Just, just two? - Just for us men. - [Mabel] Oh. - So uh, what is it you do out here? - But the short version though, 'cause I'm about ready for that headboard. - Well the truth can't be truncated. - Well, try your best. - How's this for Cliffs? Family came out from Appalachia in 1903. This mine's been in my family for generations. We were the mercury capital of the world, till the mine collapsed. My grandfather was trapped underneath that mine. He was leading a prison work release program for murderers, rapists, all kinds of filth. They were left there for dead, until he came walking out 11 days later when the plate shifted. He was the only one that made it. Three dead felons left below, gnawed to the bone. - That's crazy. - See my grandfather, he survived by eating those sinners, organs and all. Not a secret. Made the papers everywhere. What is a secret is that we are still Appalachian sin eaters at our core. We have been for centuries. It's in our blood. So all the drifters, the travelers, all the runners, they come and sit down here at this table and confess, and we consume in proportion to the severity of the sin. Sometimes it's just a BB behind the ear. Sometimes it's an unsurvivable filet, enough for a table of six. - What's he doing? - What he always does when he ain't gonna let 'em leave. Fills them with a truth that's too hard to believe. - We take the cell phones down the Juarez, we dump 'em. We burn the bodies and the cars. No one has any idea that it is us that takes on the burden that the world would otherwise have to carry. I'm equal opportunity to at fault, even when it comes to myself. Sometimes I consume a taste of my own sin. - Ugh. - Jesus Christ. - I'm just kidding. But the train part, that's true. At will on a dime. And just not inanimate locomotives. - Like what else? - People. I know all about incentives, motivations and overall psychology. - Okay. Try me, Freud. - My family owned over 6,000 mercury rich acres, but now I'm the only one left. So last April, I sold almost all of it for $24 million. Now I have no one to spend it on. No one to give me a child. And I really want one, for more than just legacy reasons. That modest little house up there at the top of the hill, you might have seen it. All of it could be yours. I'm honest and faithful, almost to a fault. So if any of that interests you, then get up and head out to the white car. - 'Nelope. - I'll meet you there. (people chattering) - I'm gonna have a word here and make sure he's equally compensated. - 'Nelope, look at me. 'Nelope, 'Nelope! - Son, son, son, she's a stripper, she's a grifter. They all sell it. If she hasn't taken you for everything, she will. - No, she's not. - So I'm gonna get a nice little wad of cash for ya. When you check out, it'll help to heal that broken heart. - Morning coffee if he won't take it today. - Hey, aren't you gonna finish that? It's a wonderful vintage of distilled damnation right there. (hand slamming) - [Penelope] Hey. - God damn I love you, 'Nelope. - Sorry, I had to tinkle, and I couldn't take any more of that garbage he was spewing. Hey, you know all those ways you never told me how you were gonna fuck me? Well, could you just forget about 'em and come over here and make love to me for a really long time? - After that, girl, you don't even get a say.

Do I? - What do you whine about? - Oh shut up, just shut up. - What? - You tell me how Mabel give me a, a boy two months ago, and she ain't late with me in, in three years. You tell me how, huh? Make me understand- (ominous music) - 19 Calls from her daddy to this number starting at 6:24 AM. I researched the number, he's a Sanctus County Sheriff. He'll be 616 South, and Cookie said she saw him holding- - Go. You too. (car doors closing) (engine squealing) - Come on, daddy. Where are you? - God damn I love waking up next to you, 'Nelope. - I can't believe you thought I was gonna leave you for the Cheese Sauce. That idiot doesn't stand a chance against my Frank. - [Frank] We're stuck together, baby. - Like hot gum on tarmac stuck. (whimsical music) Holy shit. Is this real? - Is that another? - Oh my God, a Bugs Bunny level of karats if I ever did see. - With this diamond will thee wed? - Don't! And don't you never do that again, unless you mean it. - Okay. I was just kidding. - I'm serious. - Okay. - I'm not a joke. - Swear to God I'm gonna surprise you one day, 'Nelope. - They's just words. - Morning. Just uh, two for breakfast, please. (tense music) (bell dinging) - Uh, yeah, anywhere you want. - I'm a go with them cakes, Cookie. Damn, this is amazing. - Hm? - My dad was a Marine. - You two close? - Yeah, were really. Lost him when I was 16. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't be, 'cause my 16 with him was better than 100 would've been with any lesser man. I planned enlisting myself, but uh, after my dad died, I had to take care of my mom and little sister. - I bet he's proud of you, Frank. - Hope so. - He is. And what about you, Frank? Do you want any babies of your own? - Never not wanted 'em. You? - Well, I haven't until now. Take him. - What? - Take him. (endearing music) - Get your ass outta the car. What did I tell ya? - No, please! - What the, you're the one that made me- (sirens blaring) - Take him. Take him with you. He'll be our protector. Your dad. (Magda whimpering) Just take him. (Magda squealing) (bell dinging) (sirens blaring) (Cleve yelling) - Hey! Hey, knock that shit off. Get your hands off of her! Turn around, turn around. - She was- - Turn around, put your hands on the hood. You okay, sweetie? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I'm okay. Thank you. - What kind of man puts his hands on a lady like that, huh? What is wrong with you, boy? (gunshot firing) (hopeful music) (Magda squealing) (bell dinging) - Hey! - Freeze! Uh, something! - Yeah, freeze it right, you fuckin' weirdo! - 'Nelope, go get the car. - I'm on it. - You, drop that shotgun! And you, shut the fuck up! Thank you. (hopeful music) - What the hell just happened? Turn right. Turn right. Turn right you motherfucker. (tires screeching) (phone ringing) Two in the green car. - Copy that, they will not get past us. (ominous music) - Speak of the devil. - Fuck. They're making a U-turn. - Go, go, go. - It's okay, baby. It's probably just that guy from before. I think he likes me. (tense music) - Who's that? - Hm. (Frank grunting) Hey, where's my buddy? (Penelope gasps) Frank! (taser buzzing) (intense music) - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, the, the girl! - You bring the long? - Uh. Uh. Oh.

He's on his way and we've got a burden to consume. Hey, use this if there's a need. (tense music) (Cookie sniffing) (tense music) (Cookie lightly growling) (Magda whimpering) (tense music) - He's, he's already up there. - Good. (Mabel gasps) Get her cleaned and ready for me. - Okay. - And with a gentle touch. (Mabel panting) - Hand me the hose. Gentle touch. - Ain't you supposed to sponge it? - Told you, I ain't touching it. - You wanna sponge it head to toe, go ahead. You just don't understand, there ain't no harvest between our whore's legs. (Penelope whimpering) - Dear Lord, we take this Eucharist, your your last living gift, the righteous man's sustenance, and we thank you Lord for bringing us a fertile vessel so that we may continue your work, to discern the sheep from the shepherd, and only then will we dine and cleanse until the sheep are no more. - [Followers] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquities, and cleanse me from my... - Sin. - [Followers] Amen. (tense music) (Frank grunting) - You tried longer than all of them. (Frank panting) - Where is she? - Waiting for me. - No, no she's not, and she never will be. - Oh, I think you'll be surprised. - No, I won't be, not this time. I've waited my whole life to spend the last 48 hours with her, and even if that's all I ever get, it'll dwarf anything you've ever felt. She and I have a love not even death could steal, and you know that. It's the kind you've only ever read about in books, and you'll never get it. - You know what I hate more than anything? Hypocrisy. The whole world's full of uneducated finger pointers, pointing mostly at people like me. But make no mistake about it, we save souls from eternal damnation. That's what sin eaters do. Son, that's a 60 gallon drum of purified water. That's survival for at least a couple weeks. Unless, of course, you starve. So tell me, punk, how long until you take a bite and become one of us. - If you touch her, I swear to God, somehow, someday, I will find you. - This isn't a Batman episode. You're not getting outta here. - 'Nelope! 'Nelope! I'm coming! - Where is he? Is he dead? - One thing's for sure, he's, he's not coming for ya. - You don't know Frank. - Oh, I think I do. - What do you want? - What you've been giving away your entire life. All of a sudden I want it and you take it off the shelf? Why is that? - I ain't for sale. I never have been. - I bet there's a lot of inflated dicks out there that would disagree. What's one more? - Fuck you! - You should have taken that walk last night. I know you thought about it, but you know, you went to him and that just breaks my heart. - You don't have a heart to break. - You're going to give me a child. That's a fact. I'd rather do it with a coddle then a claw. I mean originally, every single act procreation in nature was a rape. Only humans asked. - You ain't touching me. - Why is it so valuable all of a sudden. I mean, you've been using God's reproductive system as a tool your entire life. I mean, either sex is meaningless or rape is bad. Can't be both. - It's the hand that holds the gift that can change what's in the box, and I ain't ever willingly held it out for free. Not once. Not for nobody. Except Frank. You think you's talking over a lowly stripper's head all the time, don't ya? Just eats you alive that I got a freight train of love headed only for him, and not even you can budge it. - I could love you, if you let me. Think about it. I'll see you in the morning. - No. Somehow in my heart I know he's coming for me. - [Radio Preacher] Who will be put to shame. (speaking in foreign language) In Greek, you will be humiliated by this misplaced confidence. (Radio chattering) So he says in Psalms 5... (ominous music) - Daddy. Dad, daddy. (Molly screaming) No! No! Daddy. (Molly panting) (Molly sobbing) No! (tense music) (intense music) (Molly panting) (tense music) (Molly crying) - I'm sorry, for all of it. (tense music) - Stare all you can do? - I'm supposed to watch ya. Chisos said so. - You know staring and watching aren't the same thing. And I feel you staring something powerful. Yeah. Powerful like a freight train. Do you mind if I call you Freight Train? - Whatever you want, I'm just here doing what I'm supposed to. - You know, I felt them hands on me earlier, longer than was strictly necessary, and they felt powerful, too. But gentle. You a gentle fella deep down? - Not with ladies. I don't mean to be, but, I get excited, handle 'em too rough. Everyone they brought me, even my wife, got a hold of her too hard. Now her windpipe don't work right. Shy's away from me touching her at all now. - Well you know, rough ain't so bad when you're used to it. In fact, rough makes some girls wetter than the Pontchartrain. Can you keep a secret? I'm one of them girls, and I ain't felt nothing in them hands that I don't find myself wanting, and I think you want it, too. Them hands all over me. (Magda whimpers) I ain't trying to trick you to get out. Hell, you could even come in here if you wanted to. I gotta touch you proper. Come on, you can't get me out like this then deny me. - Chisos wouldn't stand for it. - Fuck Cheese Sauce. (Cookie laughs) Besides, I thought we was keeping secrets. You know, it's a secret that's never told that offers the most extraordinary of suspense. And I don't know about you, but I ain't gonna tell a soul. Shh. (light dramatic music) - Stick your leg out. - Okay, I'll do what you say, but then when I get out, you gotta do what I say, too. Teasing makes the pleasing so much better. Once you get that thing fastened, sit down, okay? Go on, sit down now. Gonna have to scooch away from that table if you want me to sit in your lap. (light suspenseful music) - I need you to know that I'm a religious man. I am. I do believe in, in, in carrying the weight of the world by consuming sin. I do, I just do. (stuttering) even if you people think we's crazy and all. - No, nobody thinks you're crazy. Nobody thinks you're crazy. - It's just, I, I, I, I, I can't find nothing wrong ya done. - Like I said, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong. Nobody did nothing. - If you'd have done some sinning. - [Frank] Nobody did nothing. - I'd a had no issue. - Just gotta help me. Help me outta here. Look, just, just throw me a rope. - No, no, no. - No, no, no. All you gotta do is- - No, no, shut your mouth. - Help us, please. - Just shut your fuckin' mouth! Shut your fuckin' mouth! Just shut it, now! I ain't gonna save you and cross my own people, but you can save yourself. - What are you talking about? (stuttering) What are you talking about? - You gonna have to commit a sin just like me to do it. - What are you talking about? (intense music) The fuck? God! (intense music) (monitor beeping) (intense music) - No child, no. (defibrillator squealing) (defibrillator shocking) Bless you, child. I'll tell him you loved him by dying today. (intense music) (defibrillator squealing) (defibrillator shocking) You're still out, ain't you? (intense music) You keep that love alive. You hear me, child? You hold on tight. Don't ever let it go. (intense music) (light dramatic music) - Scooch. - You get in that corner and turn around. This ain't a wifely thing to watch. (Magda whimpering) - Uh-uh-uh. Teasin' first, pleasin' second. Here you go. Just look. You never laid eyes on anything like this before, have you? You ready, Freight Train? Tell me. - I'm ready. - No, look at me and tell me. - I'm ready. - If you meet him, tell him I'm sorry about the past.
