How do you find me now? - Very cool. When I woke up, sat that thing on my face. But then all over my face. This is already a lot better. Nothing for me. The nights are really awful. - Do you have to sleep with it? And if I leave it in the morning, do I sometimes ... I don't know. It's not a pussy, but ... - O hole, Jade. How long should you wear it? - One more week. I'm Darth Vader. Sexy Darth. How are you? Give me a hug. - How's he going? All right, Jade? - Yes. And with you? You know who turns me to the right has whipped? That guest of school. That ugly with that short leg. He runs like that. You mess up your neck. - Really, you should have seen his face. Jade, how are you? Your ex should soon appear, huh? That Kieran is going to sit long. Just count. - Absolutely. No worries. It is not released for the time being. How are you? I haven't seen you for so long. How are you doing? - Are you okay? You were in the hospital, didn't you? - Yeah, for a while. But you're back there. - I need a few more operations. Sorry I didn't come by. - Gives nothing. I should have done that. Make sure you're back there. Do you enjoy yourself a little? They dragged me along. - Oh yes? It's been a long time ago. Tof. At home everything okay? Can you do it all? You do have fun, I see. - Yes. Jij? Look. - Thank you. Nice to chat for a while. Good thing you are there again. Don't go away without saying a day.

Can you give me that bag for a while? Let me through. - What are you going to do, Sham? We need to get out of here. Do you join? - Right now? Yes. Do you join? Quiet now. Don't look at me like that. Nice party? Rae and I also had a party, did Rae? At two o'clock tonight she was awake. How much is this? 40, but he can join for 25. - That was it. Oh yeah. Wait a minute. The next few weeks will not frowning. Don't look. Spend some time. Sorry. Oh, this one has a shoulder strap. Are you going to put a cup of tea for us? Does she help with being home again? Hi, Jade. Tell them to go. - She's her grandmother. Yes, and she is my daughter. Rae, come here, baby. Come to mama. What did you do? Shit, you bleed. You did so well to her, Jade. What a sweetie. Stay away from my daughter. Don't touch her. - Oh god, let's look. Get up. - Let me look. Sorry. I have to leave. - I don't want Pat coming here. Goed. Well, Pat won't be coming anymore. I have to leave. Can you watch her? Hi, Rae. Can you hold your head? Five minutes? I get a headache from you. You make a lot of noise, huh? Who pressed your button, dumb pussy? Get up. Look, she's listening. What a sweet girl. Will we tell you a story? Eli, Jade, Sham. Then we go. Are we ready? Are you okay? I'm not going in there. - Not really? Hoezo? There is so much here, and you want in the crash cars? It's Friday night. - Don't you go with it? I jump into it. I'll see you soon. Are you going alone? - No, with Eli. What do you want, Jade? - It doesn't matter to me. What happened to her face? - Come on, we're going. Gift from her ex. - You don't mean that. Smile. Oh, my god. Then we go. Who is screaming now? - Jesus Christ. Does she belong to the attraction? - No. Oh no. She just looks like that. Walk through. She looks scary. - Rotten, tumbling. Do you go with me? Do you still want some food? All right, you were there, man. - I still see you. Look. It is beautifully cured, Jade. I am very happy with your progress. Turn your head to the right. Do I need to undergo surgery again? At this moment I do not believe that can be achieved with this. But there is still an operation? If the scars are going to limit you in your movements ... then we immediately intervene. - And if not, is there an operation then? We need to see how things are coming eighteen months is going to develop. Then we know more. But I am very satisfied. Maar ... - Listen to the doctor. And then we only operate if we expect that improvement ... relative to what it is now. - So I have to do it with this shit? We are happy with where we are now. - But I don't. Jade ... Take a walk. This is so. I grab the longer side on the inside and drape it around my head. You can do it tighter or looser, just what you want. I'll fix it here. That's the way it is. What I like about this look is ... if you want to eat or if you are among women ... you can release the pin so. ORIENTATION. I am. - God, you're not like that ... What is it called? - What? Do you think so? This doesn't matter, Jade. If you have left behind today, you can continue with your life. Is it going? Get up, please. Get the suspect. Get your hands out of your pockets. This was a particularly violent one and horrible crime. Your defense is the unreasonable behavior of the victim ... you have driven to throw acid into her face ... I do not accept. You have this attractive young woman the chance of a normal life deprived. You have limited her in her freedom. She will live her whole life face ... with the consequences of your act. So I will be quite long giving time ... to think about your actions and the devastation ... Excuseer. Hello, this is the clinic from Dr. Abbas? You called me about a possible operation. That's right. Mam? Would you be able to lend me money? - How much? Tweeduizend. Maybe a little more. Aren't you nice? What do you want to do with it? I found a clinic online who can restore my face. Honey, that's not how it works. I'm sorry. If he looks at me like that, I no longer have it. So I told him: If I say no, do you like it? Because I don't think so. Do you know how I know it's real love? Because we both shave while not needed. Schattig. How's Rae doing? - Good. It is definitely nice to be home again. - Yes, it is. And how about sleep? You said you suffered from nightmares. Yes.... Yeah, it's okay. Is it going, Jade? Yes, fine. I just asked myself whether you could arrange a job for me.

Just like In the Dream Garden, that toddler program. Do you know that? And I lie there and look at her. She kept saying it. She kept saying it. I was ... I was chilling with the baby and then the phone went. He was. He asked if he could come by. We didn't live together at that time. We had no money. So I said okay. He came in ... We were chilling for the TV. I felt something on my face. I first thought it was coffee. I felt with my hands. It was my skin. I began to scream. Rae guessed too. I ran out. Fortunately, the door was open my old neighbor. I ran inside. I kept my face under the tap. I tried to open the tap, but my hands ... It didn't work. My skin just hung loose.

Your mother takes her home. Go to Sham, Jade. For a while. - What? And then Rae? It's too confusing. She never knows when she will see you. Daisy is professional ... - Bullshit. She needs rest and regularity, and she doesn't get that from you. For a while. You can stay, honey, but you have to sleep on the couch. My sweetheart is going to make a lot of money.

The clinic is here. Normally. This is the exact address. Okay, follow me. -Where is it? Here, normally. I don't know. Not really. Can I call? Will I call? -I do it. Okay, you got a phone. I think it's not here. There is no connection. Wrong number. The number is not correct. Something terrible for you, Jade. After the whole trip ... Don't sit down alone. Naz and I are going tonight. There is a great club. Join us. You really have to go with it. Okay, Jade? Do you join? Jade ... I'm sorry. Is it going? Yes, fine. I mean it. It's really good. I don't want you to think ... I don't want you to think that did not suggest anything. Maar ... I love you, Jade. That has always been the case. Let's see where Sham is. You're my best friend. -Wat? I said we are each other's best friends. Toch? Take it easy. I shouldn't do this. -That's too late now. Maybe I'm pregnant. Would Naz be a good father? I think so. I am overtime. And I have big tits. You have to see how thick they are. We'll be both milfs soon. Toch? Are they two? The little one. Are they two? Oh, it's for you. Just say 'hello'. Hoeveel? Ha, baby. How much has it cost you? -Wat? Because I see no difference. It didn't work there. Can I stay with you for a while? My children are back home. Are they back? Geweldig. Do you know what you last told about your daughter? That is not true. You can look like a horror monster, like Quasimodo ... but what a child sees ... In the eyes of your child Are you the most beautiful. That's what a mother is for a child. I don't even want to smoke. This month we had unexpected a few strong candidates. Because of her radiant smile and positive attitude ... Were you wearing Jade Nugent. Well done, Jade.

We with his three. To Disneyland or so. Or Lapland. You can just go there. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm really sorry. I'll make it good again. Such a jerk of a security guard. Do you know what he did? He looked at the bottom of the pram. There I had hidden stuff. They are now in the flat. They search all my stuff. Is Rae here too? Yes, at the social worker. I take good care of her. Everyone says so. Her will not happen. You do so much for her. And also for me. When you were in hospital ... I did not come to you. Well true. -No, not in the beginning. No idea. I was out of consciousness. -I didn't want to be there. They said ... that more than half your face was burned. They told about the operations needed ... the transplants ... how long it would take ... the pain ... It was too difficult. My little girl ... I couldn't look at you. - It didn't have to. I couldn't see it how he had broken you. He didn't break me, Mom. He didn't do that. What are you doing there? Won my work. -Get some. I'm an employee of the month. -Get some. I'm gonna hit that security guard with it. Mama ... What is that? It's for you. Do not pull. Do you like it? Goodbye, Daisy. Just say goodbye. Bus... Mama ... Grandma, Grandma, Grandma ...
