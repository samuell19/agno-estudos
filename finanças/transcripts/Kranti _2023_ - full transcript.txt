[GOVERNMENT GIRLS’ SCHOOL, BELAGOLA] [OFFICE OF THE HIGHER & PRIMARY EDUCATION DEPARTMENT] These ‘play way’ government schools…. …there are 48, 556 such useless schools in Karnataka. Yes! I have marked 12000 government schools. The closure of 12,000 government school, and private takeover of them by Salatri Educational Institutions… …is my project, Mr. Vaman Rao! 70% of the private schools in the state are already yours. Also, Salatri Breweries, Salatri Pharmaceuticals, Salatri Agro Industries, and the parent company… Janata Chit Funds is an empire by itself. Why have these government schools... found your attention, my friend? Money…truckloads of money! A section has 40 students, 4 sections to a class.. That's 160 students. 160 times 12 makes it.... ...1920 students! A 50-K annual fee per student… …with 1920 students works out to... 9 crore 60 lakh rupees! So, 9 crore 60 lakh rupees... into 12000 schools, Mr. Rao. It is a 5-year mega project. Impossible Salatri. You have identified 12000 government schools. Of these, 2116 have achieved 60% results. And 519 have achieved 70%. 90 schools with 85%, and 32 schools with 92%. Also, three girls’ high school have achieved 99%! How do we close such schools? What of the future of the children? How do we answer the government? Cool minister...! Every risk taken comes with a price tag. Let's identify 20 schools in the state, and destroy them one by one. Come this way.... This way.... Everyone come out! Children, quick, get out! Everyone come out quickly! Run! Quickly! Leave quickly! Let’s claim that the buildings were weak. As collateral damage.... ...probably 20 students will die! Help us! Sir! Sir stop! There are students inside!! Please listen to me sir! Leave me! Stop sir…please! No sir…listen to me. The eyes of the government, media, and public will turn to you. Within every 5-km radius ...the second government school must shut down. Announce Government Order saying so. This will shut down 7830 schools in one go! And the other schools, Say there is poor infrastructure, and lack of students and teachers, and can be taken over with such excuses! 12,000 schools in prime locations in the state… …will be taken over by Salatri Foundation. Announce this Government Order later! What do you think of our Salatri sir's plan? Any more questions, Mr. Rao? ‘Breaking news’ ‘Today, a government girls’ school building in a village collapsed.’ ‘Seventeen students have died.’ ‘Fifty or more have sustained grievous injuries' 'and are admitted to nearby hospitals.’ Summon the Education Minister and the responsible officials. I want to know what’s happening. That file should go to the CM tomorrow… Sir! You are waiting outside? Your blessings… Had you called, I myself would have come. -That's alright... I won’t take much of your time. I will come to the point. The Vidya Mandir Government School is turning 100. The building is weak. The walls have cracked. The roof leaks during rain. Your officials seem to be... ...sleeping on my petition! Before I retire, The school building should be secured, Vamana! You must attend the centenary celebrations. The school is the temple that gave me life. Let’s make the centenary celebrations grand! Doddamuni - Sir? Begin the school renovations immediately! Okay sir. Don’t worry sir. I will get it done personally. Nobody should raise their voice until all the schools come under our control, Mr. Rao! ‘The land of the brave, home to poets, our mother Karnataka’ Is there anyone to challenge us here? If so, I dare them to come forward! The man with a remarkable journey of business excellence… …A magnanimous creator who disrupts the style of leadership An inspiring leader, An innovator of movement… A discoverer and a visionary marvel. An entrepreneurial ground-breaker. An innovative triumphant, and a successful businessman! Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the founder CEO of KR Group… Mr. Kranti Rayanna! Congratulations sir. This is your fourth consecutive Businessman of the Year award! But no one has been able to interview you… Why is that? No one needs to know till I win. After I win... I don’t need those who make me the news. Every business of yours is thriving. You are very lucky! You’re wrong! Luck 0 percent... Effort 100 percent! Start-ups, established companies, your competitors too… are trying to copy you. Why is that? Original is always original. Any advice for your competitors? Try to replace me. One piece of advice to youngsters? Sleep to dream… Wake up to achieve! What do you have to say about your success? How do you celebrate it? The success is not mine. It is that of my school. That of my teachers. What is your proudest moment as a businessman? The day my father accepted me as a businessman. One last question! Europe’s biggest companies are joining hands to bring you down. Any comments? There's a group opposing me... But to protect me... ...an entire army awaits!

Such a short-tempered boy! In craft class, I ask him to sew, and he asks if I think he is some tailor! He is only interested in arithmetic tables… nothing else. He reads, writes, and studies nothing but maths. All other subjects, he just leaves the class! Yes! And when he leaves, a big gang follows him. This is his third school here. If he cannot stay here, I see no way out. I will have to send him abroad to his uncle. He who has no knowledge... ...will have no character... I don’t know how to tell him this, Mr. Srikantaiah! Run! Run 10 laps around this ground. Why did you stop? -Tired… Tell me in terms of numbers. In numbers? How? Right! You can’t build life with numbers alone. You need knowledge. Your parents who gave birth to you... your biology. The tasty food made by your grandma...that is chemistry. You light a lamp after dark…physics! Your home and your village…geology! After you pass out, this school... ....will form your history! Kannada, with Her two thousand years of history... ...is your Mother! All of this knowledge belongs together, like your friends.

First Rank Usha… Bold, clever, beautiful, courteous, virtuous, cultured! I am these six! And you are in a fix! Why did the twilight sun draw Her golden profile to my awe? Why did she turn away And toss a smile my way? Why did the twilight sun draw Her golden profile to my awe? Why did she turn away And toss a smile my way? She set off alarms in my heart My heart solitary and still She stepped in to fill On the hint of a smile My eyes feast awhile Desire knocks on the door Yet the beauty spoke not more As our sleeves shared a touch She left without saying much O Doll! My sweet doll! Why did the twilight sun draw Her golden profile to my awe? Why did she plant in me that golden dream? The eyes softly trick the mind As her robe whispers a hello to the wind This rush of hormones a breathless trip Like a sweet lingering taste on the lips Nothing can you learn if you turn away from me Dance with me once, said she Placing cymbals in my empty palms My heart solitary and still She stepped in to fill To lightly caress those hips I yearn When will her consent I earn? In the age of our carefree past I met this sweet mischief of a lass That bond of our school days She rings the bell of memories always O Doll! My sweet doll! O doll! My sweet doll!

Krishna Krishna… First Rank Usha… That’s me, me, me! Where is my deeply moving love letter? I threw it away… away... away... Show me what’s in your hand. I won’t give, I won't give, I won’t give! Show me.... No... no! Hey! Show me! ‘Eighteen, sixteen, nineteen, ten, zero!’ ‘Did not clear the exams’ Everyone else passes, but my son fails. This means you did not teach him properly. You have failed as a teacher. So teacher, Should I hit you with a stick? or kick with my boots? Kranti no! Kranti! Hey, hold him! Kranti! Please don't hit him! Sir...No sir! Let him go. Please...you can take me instead... Sir please sir! Sir please sir! Hey Kranti! What is this Bhargava? He’s covered with wounds? Dear, take care of the child. Stop, ma! He who does not fear the rod, will surely become a rowdy. His forehead bleeds... ...but no tears line his eyes. No fear lives in his face. A person like this staying at our home is not right. What are you saying? He’s your son! An orphan without a mother. Where will you send him? Far from the motherland… ...to his uncle abroad. No mistake of his is so grave that you are sending him away from home, Bhargava. No one can object to my decision. Stay safe, my boy… Kranti... Kranti, don't go... Cheeeseee! What happened? He escaped. In politics you cannot afford to lose a vote. And in anarchy, you should not miss any blows. We missed only one mam. We only need to breach Bhargava’s fort... ...and the whole village will fall! The fort will be handled by the court, Dore! We need to deal with the school where the minister studied. Any sentiments, Mr. Rao? The news is that the school will top this year too. He is presenting rewards and honors to the students… That’s my job Salatri, I have to do it. Salatri Foundation will hold all the ranks this year, Mr. Rao! Not even a single rank should go to another school. That’s his job, he must only get it done. That is the school I studied in. We must smoothly handle it without violence. Okay? Your teacher came to complain of the shaky building. We will shake up the building’s future itself. Is there an emperor to challenge this king? Does your school have such a champion?

He will not think of coming back to his native soil, after attaining a great stature... Even if the tree touches the sky… …its roots still remain in the earth. See for yourself. Brother… Brother… Coffee! Sir... The court has ruled in favour of Salatri Foundation. We have to vacate our homes in a month’s time. The court has sent a notice. The lives of so many people will be ruined. We have no idea what to do, sir. We have to get a stay, dad. Otherwise, They will get the decree and we will be in big trouble.

Every blade ever forged yearns to reach my hand! Don’t make that dream come true. Hey Nanjappa What happened to the paper grading? The guy you called is eating dirt… …and his father scratches his head in confusion. Faceless coward who enquires about my school... Who the hell are you? The school is mine… …every student there is my junior. If you try to mendle with juniors marks, do you think their seniors won't save them? Hey, go get those answer papers! Go! I grew up holding a slate in a government school. You are the scum who holds up an ID slate in prison. Your son is the one who faces chargesheets. What does he know of the value of answer sheets? Nanja… Nanja… Hey Nanja… Nanja… I will take care of you later! Are you busy singing right now? Namaste. The SSLC results have been announced today. At this time, The school that I studied in... Sarkari Vidya Mandira school... …has obtained 100 percent results! I hope that our government schools ...continue to deliver such results. That is my wish. Compose yourself, Narasappa. He is your only son. I understand. In a month's time, All schools will be ours. The investors are coming. Let’s not be hasty and do something stupid. We are playing a big game. With profit and loss. Don’t get emotional. Let’s plan something! Speak not of dignity to the loincloth… Or accounts with the butcher, Salatri. This vampire has been introduced to fear. Time to introduce... the vampire to him! Like Rose and Jack on the Titanic… …On a cart... We have a Rose and a Thorn! Ready… Next change! Next change?! My back will break any moment, dear. Don’t worry, darling! Even the heaviest fruit... can be supported by a slender stem! Oh! Oh the stem is bending… bending… Grandpa He bit me. Grandpa. Look grandson, none of the boring wedding stuff for me. Then? Mehendi ceremony for her. Bachelor party for me. Sangeet for her Dance for me! Jyothi... - Yes? Where is Kranti? Brother? - Yes? I’ll call him, dad. Brother… Dad is looking for you! Dad…brother. The journey is tomorrow night. Ask him to be ready. As the school celebrations end... let him leave! Go where? Till our anniversary celebration is complete... my grandson will not leave! We have lived without him for 20 years. For 20 days at least... he will can stay with us. Not possible, mother. Look, If you want your son to listen to you… …my son must listen to me. ‘CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS’ ‘Sanksrit shloka' Friends, A hearty welcome to our school’s centenary celebrations! This is a school with 100 years of history! Black clouds have gathered in the sky. Friends celebrate in the school on a high. The children’s drums chant Kannada to the sky. And my son lies in a coma. When the demon sleeps, the whole land is in peace. I won’t even give you that option Narasappa. This school was built not to earn incomes, but for spiritual outcomes. - From the past 100 years... I injected betonamit cracking agent last night into the structure. In seconds, Your school will collapse before your very eyes. For the centenary celebrations of Vidya Mandir school… …consider this a small tribute from Narasappa Dore! Run! Make way! Watch out! Run! Help...help! Help...help! Make way…make way! Help...help! Come…its fine. Kranti… Kranti…help! Hold on! Come this way! Run! Run kids, run! That way…. Run, children! Quickly! Lucky… Let’s go… What will happen to us? Careful children! Someone open the door! - Careful children, come this side. Jenny!! Jenny!! Ma'am Jenny!! Jenny ma'am, Open the door. Help us! - Open the door. Jenny ma'am! Open the door. Hold on to this guys. Go my friend! Jenny ma'am please wake up! Open the door! Open the door! Kranti... Kranti! Look! Save our teacher... Ayyo Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny... Sir... we don’t have time... Let’s go! Where? Why? I won't come. Don’t be stubborn sir.... Let’s go... Where do we hold classes? Where should the children come tomorrow? We will take care of it sir... Let's go... A school with a 100 years of history. Tomorrow, It won't exist... Lucky… It hurts! I am here... don't worry The Sarkari Vidya Mandir school building ...has collapsed during the centenary celebrations. Your friend Narasappa Dore is said to be the cause of the tragedy. You did not go to the celebrations either. Is there a link here? Look, The structure was weak. After renovations, we will celebrate the centenary in a grand manner! This was my suggestion to Teacher. Their undue haste has led to this! The education of my school's students ...should not suffer. Let us resolve this issue. Lies… Don’t worry sir. We have arranged for a space for the children to study. Usha and Gopi will handle it. Our school will be ready again in a year. The reconstruction of our school building, is my responsibility. No, Kranti… What you give is… Charity! … but what the government rebuilds... ...is a Duty! I should not die with the feeling of growing one rotten apple. He who cuts the tree... ...must plant the seed. He must change. You must change him. Give me your word. I didn’t think we’d get such a great place so soon for the kids. We can’t thank you and your father enough. Gopi, till the kids are here.. …there should be no trouble. -Okay Kranti. Will we see our school again, Kranti? Namaste. Six hundred and thirty six students, Eight teachers, Two sports teachers, One non-teaching staff, one principal.. comprises this Sarkari Vidyamandira school... which has collapsed during the centenary celebrations! I'm submitting a petition for immediate renovation… Ha, what a life sir. I have listened to such garbage here that… …my ear drums are broken. I have to wear a hearing aid now. Let that be. What is your problem? Your school has suffered a demise. And this is the post mortem! Your situation is weighty. But not your file. I didn’t understand… Government staff don’t listen… …when their palms don’t glisten. Asking for a bribe? Of course! Only after 26 signatures and 12 departments… …can you get permission for building a school. After which you will get a grant. Grant? Library books, blackboards, sports equipment, dust bins… For non-academic activities, You will also get 70-80 lakhs! Spend 20 lakhs from this kitty. And the rest …will go to you, my lord. What are you saying? What of the students’ future? Tell me when you will construct the building. Srikantu... How long will you pursue this futile exercise? Do one thing. I’ll give you any amount of loan to construct the school. Pay it whenever you can. But the monthly interest... must reach me promptly! What do you say? [OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COMMISIONER] Sorry, sir! I heard you suffered a lot. I will definitely take action against all these people. In three months, I will ensure the school work begins. -Sir? Take this. Ensure that this file is moved today. Okay sir. Sir, Sir, I will speak personally with the Minister. Don’t you worry, sir. Thank you for your help. Don’t mention it. It is my duty. We will take your leave. Sir, wait here. Let me fetch the car. Kranti… I am feeling hungry. ‘Ensure this file is moved immediately’ Just a minute… If your own petition is washed away by your own tears… …who will read it sir? I am Sadashivaiah. I too was a school teacher once. Don’t ask me where that school is now. A government that grants 5 wine store licences per kilometre…. …has passed an order saying …every second school in a 5-km radius must be closed. This order led to the closure of 8000 government schools. Schools producing merit students were deemed structurally weak. Result-producing schools were reported to have no faculty. Those who questioned were threatened with dire consequences. Including your school, They have shut down 10,370 school in the State. Roughly 77000 teachers are pushed to the streets. But…what about the students? ‘If a poor boy cannot go to education… …then education must come to him’ So said Swami Vivekananda. Students and parents need not fear. Your children will be enrolled in private schools. The fees will be paid by the government. Right to Education is this government's goal... and duty as well! Enticing people with private schools… The future of government school children was sacrificed by the Education Minister Vaman Rao. When the school bell rings… …the uniformed rich children enter. And when the security strikes the gate with his baton… …our students enter. They get teachers with laser pointers… …and our children get sheds with one monitor. They get hygienic and filtered water. Our kids get water, if at all, from a tap. They get a large playground. And our children provide the applause. The rich can live in a hundred ways. But the poor can escape poverty only through education! If this too is snatched away... what will they grow up to be? Has nobody questioned this? Roughly 22 lakh children have been ‘corporatized’ I went all the way to Delhi to question this. Your kindness... ...helped me return safely! With a student with a book and pen… …they say a teacher can transform the world. That kind of teacher is selling tea today. Rajeevappa… DURGA TEACHERS’ COLONY Wondering why the market yard has a teachers’ colony? A donation of 16-acre compound for homeless teachers like me… …courtesy of the kind-hearted... ...Bhargava Rayanna! Because we are protesting the injustice to government schools… Salatri has approached the courts to evict us. Narasappa is forcing us to sign over the papers of this place. Today is the final hearing sir. Tomorrow this teachers' colony... its poor teachers… …will be homeless. Hey! sir? They are all educated! No thumbprint required. They will sign… Please sir! Hey come! You’re wasting time Bhargav. In 10 minutes, All the teachers will sign. For every 100 who want to destroy... there will be one to defend! Falsehood wears a flashy suit… …while Truth, is hiding with not even a loincloth to cover its modesty. When will this saviour come? Get him! Owing to lack of evidence, This case is dismissed Your lies are supported by the might of deception. My truth has the strength of elephants. The time has come for the truth to emerge. If a student completes 2 years of pre-university and 3 years of degree… …with minimum 50% marks, ...they get to study 2 years of B.Ed. On passing the course, they have to take the Teacher Eligibility Test. Even if you score 150 marks for 150 questions in 150 minutes… when the government calls for appointees... …you still take an entrance test. Only the topper... ...gets a 40000-rupee salary... and a teacher’s job! Even they who guide the world... must take this route to be a teacher! THIS! Can you do this Narasappa? You were looking at earning all these days. But today... ...you will see some burning also. Tell that minister and the other sinisters… 12,000 schools, 77,000 teachers & 23 lakh students… …should remain they way they are. Only then will you too remain. Else! Karma may let you go... Else! but not Kranti! Good evening Nanjappa. How relaxed you are! Can you see me suffer? I used to honestly lie after swearing an oath on the Gita in court. A uniform-less Subash Bose has come to teach me this is wrong. He has laid you to rest in peace. He has me sitting uselessly. He would started for the other two by now. Better be safe than sorry. ‘Let all the world live happily’ * Sanskrit Sloka Chants * Hey! Who are you all? Sunitha! Security! Stop this tape recorder! Who let them in? Move aside, you! - Good morning, sir. Sunitha, who let them in? Send them out! Move! Sunitha! Stop it! Where are you? -Here! I am here! Why did you let these monkeys in? Since it’s your birthday and The media is expected… …I thought you got them here for the celebrations. I have arranged for coffee and snacks too. Fine, get me some coffee too. Okay… We want coffee too! Hey, stop! Okay! Hey! Sip silently please! -Sir, phone! Who is it? The investors are here. Where is minister Rao, Shanmukha? He is not picking his phone. Five minutes, I will connect him to you. Okay. Good morning to all my investors! Good morning! Welcome to the Salatri group of companies! Here, we have created one more mega project for you. Hello?` Oh, is it? Thank you so much! Well, 12000 government schools... Well, 12000 government schools... ....are being acquired by Salatri group of companies in Karnataka. So sorry, excuse me! Okay let's... We got the information that you aren't getting any government assets. Please stop wasting our time. That is fake news! Connect me to Vaman Rao now! - Yes sir - Immediately! Who gave you this information? The brilliant… …outrageous …supreme …stalwart What? Boss… It’s your office. Sit down! On our Government school land... ... you want IT parks, fancy hotels, malls, ...trading centre, etc… Good. Salatri... I will tell you a small story. Hear it out. A beautiful mango orchard. Trees full of fruits. A passer-by’s eye ...fell on the fruits. His eyes not being able to go near the fruits... His feet took him to the trees. His feet not being able to pluck the fruits... ...his hands plucked them. The hands that plucked the fruits could not eat them... ...and so his mouth did. The fruit in his mouth... ...reached his stomach. The gardener saw all this. He broke the back of the passer-by. The faultless spine of the man... suffered the blows. On suffering the blows... The man’s eyes, which had seen the fruits, watered. This is Karma. In this story... the beautiful orchard is our Government school. The thief wanting to steal the fruits is you. The gardener guarding the orchard.... ...is me! If you steal from me and mine... ...you’ll have nothing left to call yours. You have one week. You are confident becuase you have people’s support. With just a snap, ...they will switch sides! Hey Salatri! The stars in the sky, the fish in the sea, and my people… …will never change. One more week! Mr. Rao! Where were you? We have a serious problem! Let’s solve it sincerely. Kranti was here. He’s given us a week’s time. We’ll take a proper decision. He does not know of me it seems. Can we come to an agreement? Vaman sir... Are you sitting on a nuke? I’m sitting in front of the missile itself. I don’t know how to act like a good man. Will you be a good student to Srikantiah sir? Or else.... Should I become a teacher to teach you a lesson? You decide! You don’t know politics. Vaman Rao... Allow me to be in peace where I am. If I come to where you are… …you will have to vacate. Hey grandpa.. Careful! Go! Why are you looking at me that way? My Sharu... ...looks an 18-year old belle! Che… Go away! Be happy with your women friends. Where are you going? With my grandson to while away the time. You enjoy! I’ll see you. Madam... I miss you! Miss you too! What a wonderful husband you have! And my man, ...has been idle from 20 years. First Rank Usha! The Man’s costume, perfume, performance… …are all at a different level. Call my grandson. Where are you? Why? I am at your house. But I can’t see you? I have arranged a bachelor party for grandpa. Only a party? With a special number too. Naughty! Can I come too? Naughty! Don’t you ever come here. Oh... Hey Usha? Yes...? Don’t let grandma find out about this. Okay? Okay? Oh Lord! All decked up and ready to go A work of art now on show Her soft-limbed moves and doe-like eyes Give me a fever that's on the rise Her swan-like grace Reflects Beauty's lineage The driving churn of those shapely hips Brings one sweet wish to my lips Shake those hips, go! Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! I am here to see you My sister’s boyfriend, are you? Why this yawning gap between us? Won't you come close, make no fuss? Kiss me once! Just once! Take it Pushpavati! Take it Pushpavati! Take it Pushpavati! A dab of oil for my hair Applied by hands that care To cool down my body heat Exchange sweet nothings with desire frothing I need some one! Don't send me such an invite! This call sends my heart thudding Only home-cooked food for me Forbidden the ‘outside’ delicacy I am Pushpavati Your ‘no’ will hurt me It hurts to say ‘yes’ And I want to say ‘no’ even less! Won't you groove my way? Won't you groove my way? Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! When I wear my sister’s dress Thoughts of you leave me a hot mess The very thought makes me blush! I cannot control this rush! My girl will come She will give me an earful of advice Mouth words at you packed in spice She will drag me away But why do you come so close, though? Why does your bosom heave so? Why do you dart at me, dear? Why whisper a smile in my ear? Why don't you sway your body my way? Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! Shake it Pushpavati! Stop it! Sweet child... Pushpavati... Take it Pushpavati! Take it Pushpavati! Take it Pushpavati! Yes..right… Who is Sharada Devi here? What do you want? We are from the Income Tax Department. You have to cooperate. But officer, If you don’t have a search warrant… …I can file a case claiming trespass. Officers, start the search. A plus B whole-square minus… Hello sir! Come here! Do you have a recognition certificate? Have an NOC for running this school? Which board are you affiliated to? How much fees do you collect? Fees? What is the school budget? Where is the sponsorship letter? Madam…that is… Are you on the Board of Directors? If not, move away. Children, leave All of you go home Classes won't be conducted here anymore. Don't come back Who owns this property? Brother…. Hello Raghavan, Play the breaking news! Kemparaju, turn on the TV. 'Prominent farmer activist and sustainable agriculture crusader.... Bhargava Rayanna, did not obtain permissions from the public education department...' Are you Bhargava? Yes, why? Get up! - he is illegally running a school...' I am arresting you for illegally running a school. 'Bhargava Rayanna is taken into police custody' Sir…sir -What do you have to say this? 'He has no answers...' Why are you arresting our boss? Sir...sir! Boss! 'Bhargava has accepted that he is guilty' Bhargava!! Everyone’s watching sir. 'Bhargava Rayanna will be subjected to criminal proceedings.' 'Violating the provisions of the Karnataka Education Act...' Sign here. '...unauthorized operation of the school by Bhargava Rayanna' Sir, it seems you arrested my father this morning? We arrest many criminals. Which criminal do you mean? Sir...Bhargava Rayanna... Oh that guy… the accused has been produced in court. You can go meet him there. Tell me Jyothi… The court was closed, and Dad has been taken into custody. The court is closed over the weekend. He can only be produced in court again on Monday. He will have to remain in jail for now. Brother…. Take care of grandpa and grandma. I will bring Dad back home. You’re supposed to be in custody of the court… …but you are in Salatri’s custody. Who I am... What my connections are… … your son has no clue. But you do. You should have schooled him. The parents must know to provide quality education for the child. And you put him in a corporation school! Look,... ...your son is roaming the streets like a madman. Hello… Look at your father. I pity you… So sad. Go sightseeing with friends.. …take selfies with the family … …finish attending the function… …and take the return flight. Instead... you focus on me... my business...No! My business is none of your business. Is that clear? I made a mistake. My dying wish... was to unite father and son. I asked you to come home I insisted that you stay back. My stubbornness... has led my son to this plight. We were not fortunate enough to see you grow up. To stand shoulder to shoulder with his grown-up son.... wasn't in his stars either! How can we, who asked you to come home... ...now ask you again to leave from here? I can see no other way. Please return, Kranti. No! My son won’t go anywhere. Basava Rayanna’s grandson… Bhargava Rayanna’s son… Kranti Rayanna! My son! He speaks out against injustice. He always rights wrongs. Kranti is my life. I made him leave here for his well-being. Not because I feared harm to him. No one who can stop him... ...has been born yet. If the sky bows its head… …the earth is of no value. If you bow… …our life has no meaning! It is written your horoscope… …that you will live for our people. Who am I to correct this? Who is he to stop this? I learnt from others that you are a big businessman. I need to see this with my own eyes. Yes! I am ready for the family photo. Son! Grandson! This is what a family looks like! Super! Dad, I’ll handle the office affairs today. Is it? -Yes I had asked for the sacks to be dewormed and cleaned. Will you get it done? Yes Dad. Not one worm will survive. I will clean it all. Okay How dare you lock up government officials? Do you know the consequences? ‘Government’s work is God’s work’ But Salatri has become your god. You accept bribes with glee right? Because Gandhi on the note doesn’t hold a stick? Hey, who the hell are you to question us? Excise Official Nagabhushan... You patronize Salatri. That’s why 2 lakh wine stores operate without licences. I have seen many such allegations and petitions in my career. You see mister… Drug Board Joint Director Balraj Yadav… You call no tenders You fill the forms, and even sign them. Salatri Pharma wins all the tenders. Hello sir! You’re such a good player! Football, volleyball, bat-ball, laptops… Instead of reaching government schools… …they reach private schools. So ? You lock us up and threaten us? Let us go! With just one phone call- Looks like the caller is experiencing tremors? The caller's legs are trembling too, boss. For all of Salatri's illegitimate businesses, you are the legal caretakers You have what I need... …and whatever you need is with me! Can anyone bite the hand that feeds them? We won’t betray him! We are loyal to him! How about now? We are very loyal to this sir! I can’t give up daily bread for the festive spread. How about now? I can’t give this up either! The only thing we can’t correct… …is the corrupt! Blind Money is dancing away Stamping all those in his way Blind Money, Blind Money... Boss, what next? Janakiram? Yes! Make a list! Here I go! ‘Salatri Pharmaceuticals Ltd.’ ‘Manufacture of adulterated medicines’ ‘Factories with no licenses’ ‘Tax evasion’ IPC sections 274, 276… IT Act, Section 154 ‘Illegal trading of alcohol’ -Section 415 ‘Corruption’ -417 ‘Medical insurance fraud’ -Anti-corruption act, section 7! Shanmukha, ever seen the use of so many sections in your career? Narasappa, there’s more to come. ‘Salatri Breweries’ ‘Illicit liqour manufacturing’ ‘Adulteration of public water’ -Section 277! ‘Adulteration of public water’ -278! 'Evasion of Excise Tax' Excise Act, Section 23! I need a commercial break. Shanmukha... - Yes? Looks like he has covered every section! Hey Shanmukha! Let this private school donkey hear out the government school’s notice. Janata Chit Funds! Janata Chit Funds… Public capital... Private profits! Just a chit fund owner… using public money... ... has built his empire. The same Janatha Chit Funds... will now build his tomb! ‘Janatha Chit Funds Private Limited Company has collected Public money, which the company has diverted to fund other its other private businesses. This is a crime as per the Company Act. The company has defrauded 2000 crores’ Ten times this amount, that is, 20000 crores… Must be paid as fine to the government in a week’s time! ‘Failing which, the company assets will be seized… And you will be subjected to criminal proceedings!’ You look like a nut trapped in a nutcracker! Solid property cannot be turned into cash Liquid is useless. Can’t use black money, not sufficient white money. You only have your schools. The court has granted you a week’s time. Will you pay the fine and save your schools? Or auction them and pay the fine? This... ...is the web my son has spun! To those who are corrupt and unethical… …if you speak of righteousness and ethics… …it’s like waving a red flag to a bull! Tell your son... ...of the misfortune I bring to him! When everyone worshipped the Goddess of Learning at school… …my son prayed to the God of Weapons! We can’t win these cases in the court. To save ourselves... We need to find another way out. ‘Breaking news! Company Act violations by Janata Chit Funds…’ ‘Salatri is fined an amount of 20000 crores’ ‘If Salatri does not pay the fine within the stipulated time…’ ‘…all his assets will be seized!’ Damn! You were supposed to meet people, and come back with solutions Instead you are here complaining "Simon was here, Simon was there" like a little child, Salathri Don’t worry. The auction will happen tomorrow. But no one will bid. So the government... ...will acquire your lands. What next? The government will hand out private contracts for the schools. Who is all this for? For you! How is this for news? Let me tell you some breaking news. Tomorrow’s auction ... ...will see Kranti Rayanna’s presence. Hey! I am the rogue who drinks coffee made of the milk of the Lord of Death’s buffalo! Will he come there? Will he bid there? Will he stand in front of me? I ask you to get the man and you fetch the dwarf! Shocked? Thought you’d send your boys on duty, chase him down with a car, round him up and catch him? Is he some tame goat? He is Kranti! Kranti Rayanna! Hey! One snap of my finger and the Chitradurga fort will shake! I scream and Kolar will stand to attention. I open my eyes and Karnataka will close down. And if I stand up… -Stop bullshitting man! A base voice is not enough, A strong foundation base too is required! Shoulders like boulders, thighs like pillars. Mass and class…no one can face down the Boss. Will any one dare stand in front of the Boss? To challenge him, who has the sauce? Our boss has never lost! Our boss has never lost! He is the man, the Sultan! Hey fools, look up! I told you that day, Salatri. If you put a hand on me and mine… …you’ll have nothing to call your own. 'In today’s auction of Salatri educational institutions… …Kranti Rayanna was the sole prominent bidder.' What do his friends and relatives say about him? Let’s find out. 40 students in the class would study and understand… …and he would study and understand the 40 students. In class 1, he was the class leader… …today, he’s everyone’s leader. From today on, both government and private school children… …will share the same classroom, same playground, and the same bell! His name itself means ‘revolution’ and that’s what he does. Nothing he does surprises me. Why? Because he does what people can’t even imagine. The whole state has only one man and issue on mind. Kranti! All the Salatri Foundation schools are now yours. Everywhere, Kranti-themed festivals, celebrations. How do you feel about this? Kranti is a name to you… …but a brand to me. My brand is established worldwide. I’m doing it here as well. Nothing new here. Mr. Kranti, when your school collapsed earlier… …you struggled a lot to get it rebuilt. Now you own 70% of private schools. People want to know what your future plans are. The world spins around necessity. He who puts a price tag on necessities... is a businessman! Everyone calls me one. Tomorrow onward... ...I too will be in business! Of course, you must do business. Your teacher has said the schools are under the right person. We’d like to know what revolutionary changes you will bring to the education system. Please tell us. Sorry, sorry... Who told you I’ll run the schools? I have no time for this. I have purchased... only the properties! I have nothing to do with the buildings on them. In two months, I will demolish the buildings. What?! No! Yes… Mr. Kranti! What answer will you have for the students and parents? What will you do if a stranger enters your home? We will lock the doors. Exactly, that’s what I will do to. What? You will shut down 17000 schools? That’s not right. Ma’am you have mistaken me. On my 17000 properties, I am going to put up a sign that reads... 'Trespassers are not allowed' This is injustice! What of the students and their future? Worms are eaten by frogs Frogs are eaten by snakes… Snakes are eaten by eagles, And eagles... fall to the hunter’s arrow! There is only one truth in this world. Hunger! You are hungry for TRP And I am hungry for my company's balance sheet. So Mr. Kranti, is this your final choice? I don’t have first and second thoughts. My first is my final! Srikantaiah sir! What this injustice? -Look what he has done! 'Breaking news!' ‘Kranti’s paws on the state’s schools’ ‘Capitalist holds the Goddess of Learning to ransom’ Toying with the future of children 'Uncertain future for students’ 'Statewide protests' 'You must answer us, Kranti!' 'Stop playing with children’s’ future' How can he take over the whole education system? 'It's our kids' future at stake here!' Kranti Rayanna has shut all the schools. The parents are broke. What have you decided on this matter? -Tell us sir! Answer us - Student's are future is at risk What decision has the Education department taken sir? ‘The Minister has no answer for the media’ Grandma! Grandpa! If you close the schools, what will happen to our children? Are you playing games with our kids’ education? Our curses will bring you to ruin! - If you had a family, you would understand! - Open up the schools! - You will be ruined - WHy are you sitting quietly? - How dare you close schools? - Don't you have any responsibilty? Boss... - Open the schools! People are talking ill of you. It’s difficult to hear these things about you. Janakiram.. those who speak behind our back… …will always stay back. We must surge forward anyway. Dear, our daughter has not worn the uniform for 25 days. But you go everyday in uniform. You always spoke of farmer welfare. Yet your son kills the future of farmers’ children. Can’t you advise him? Your son thinks education is like the cattle market! Get the schools open first. What happens to us if the children of great people behave like this? Hey, send him to school first. If not, I will send him to the Assembly with you! 'Kranti - a burden for the education department' 'His father, Bhargava, was arrested a month ago for running illegal school' 'Such disgusting work could only be done by Bhargava's song' 'Aren't you ashamed looking at the innocent students...' '...waiting outside the closed schools, Mr Kranti Rayanna?' Is your grandson... doing the right thing? Preventing children from studying... Is it not a crime? During the Churning of the Ocean... it was poison that emerged first! The Shiva who is swallowing the poison.... is our Kranti! Grandma! All my friends are asking… …when will the schools reopen? When will I go to school? ‘The Chief Minister is meeting Kranti at her office…’ ‘We telecast this meeting live on our channel’ Kranti... the man within you... is now a warrior. He must now win the battle. Down, Down Kranti Go! Move back! Go! Move! Get baack! What is this, Kranti? This is the revolution, madam. It seems you requested for this meeting to be telecast live. My life is an open book and my transactions are clean. I didn’t request it... I demanded it! You commit a crime and speak like an achiever. You are fighting a battle you can’t win... Don't you think so? If you have called me… …doesn’t it mean I have won? Education... is a fundamental right of children! You have closed all the schools... and prevented children from studying! This is a crime as per the law. At this very moment.... You can be arrested! No madam, it can’t be done. If you arrest me as per law… the same law demands... you arrest your ministers... as well as their friends! Will you do it, madam? Mr. Kranti... Know your limits! You speak in front of the government. You cannot make false accusations. I am a student of Vidya Mandir Government School… …of Mr. Srikantaiah! I was taught to open my mouth to eat... as well as question! In our state.... 12000 schools have been closed down! No one saw it as a crime. Thousands of teachers lost their livelihood. Again, no one saw it as a crime. The children in these schools... were forced away from education. Many thousands of children became child laborers. Still, no one saw a crime. 200 and more schools collapsed… …and 48 children died. Even so... ...no one raised a hue and cry... ...no questions were asked... ...and no one saw a crime there! But when I close private schools… …the people raise a racket and pelt stones at me. The media makes a big hue and cry about it. Why? Why so much indifference to government schools? The roads laid by the government are ours… …as are water, electricity, and even our Aadhar cards! But are government schools... not ours? I wanted to raise this awareness… …and that’s why I have done this. If what you say is true… …as the CM of this state, I give you my word. No matter the stature of the perpetrator… or their position... …they will be punished as per the law of the land. But you who know better… …how can you punish the children for this? At least now... can’t you open the schools you shut down? No madam! How dare he say no to you madam… I too have some conditions. The Government Order benefiting Salatri Foundation... ...must be rescinded. The 12000 shut government schools... ...must be reopened. The 200 collapsed school buildings.... ...must be rebuilt! As per statistics for 2020… …an ordinary clerk ...spends 40% of their income on their children’s education. Thus forcing them to take out loans. Do you know why, madam? Rent…for the school bus, class infrastructure… Rent…for the playground, canteen facilities … and rent even for online classes. Paying rent has reduced parents... to ‘pay-rent’! Education cannot become a business. Whether government or private school… …all students …must receive free and equal education. Nice to hear, but practically impossible. For all this to be done, the government needs large amounts of funds… ..to build schools with infrastructure and facilities. This requires a lot of time. The people have given you too much time, Vaman Rao. But what have you done for them? You say ‘Right To Education’. And yet you sell this right... at a premium rate! Just one word from you madam… …and my 17000 schools.... will be handed over to the government! Convert all private schools into... government ones right away! Because tomorrow, no parent should... borrow loans for their child’s education. Education should light up the child’s future… …not burden the parents! The people are waiting, madam. No more excuses or eyewash! Those who teach the world... now stand at your doorstep! Will you make them wait? Or give them a reply? I leave it to you. I am finished! Cheers to Kranti! Only when the well runs dry… …do we learn the value of water. Better late than never. I immediately rescind the Government Order on the 12,000 schools. I will implement a scheme that will provide... ...all the necessary facilities to the Government schools. I will name a committee to investigate this education scam. Anything else, Kranti? Yes, madam! As the minister responsible for this punishable situation... I am handing in my resignation. I accept any punishment that may be meted out ...by the investigation committee. When seniors make mistakes... juniors must correct them… …and there is no mistake in this. Forgive me. You alone started this revolution! No one person can start a revolution. People like these must stand in support. Teacher is the creator... Teacher is the preserver... Teacher is the destroyer of ignorance... Teacher is the ultimate truth.... We bow to all teachers of the world... We bow to all teachers of the world...
