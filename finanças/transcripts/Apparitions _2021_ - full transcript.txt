You made it! - We made it. - Are you with anybody? Why are you wearing that? Uh, look around. You didn't graduate. They don't know that. I noticed they got here after the ceremony. All right, so I may have told them the wrong time and avoided telling them I changed courses midyear. - Ali! - I'll tell them, I swear. At an awkward dinner five years from now. I mean, look, look at those poor adorable fools. Do you really want me to ruin their hopes and dreams with the news that continue to be a fuckup today? You're a terrible, terrible person. Guilty as charged. Oh, my God. Hi. Thought I'd stop by, say congrats. Checking up on me. I'm sorry I didn't bring anything, there really isn't a registry for graduations. So, how are you? Keeping busy. You? Good, yeah. Almost a psychologist now. That is great. It's just great. Well, I've gotta get back. Just wanted to wish you well. Thanks for um, coming, Jane. It was really good to see you. You too, kid. You made a friend? Who the hell was that? And did she just check me out? It's just an old friend. Uh, you're not getting away with that, that easily. No, Ali, wait, Ali... Hey! Cool ride, can I be you when I grow up? Sorry, um, it's just Lily's never mentioned you or any of her family or friends, or anyone really. So this is kind of a huge deal. Uh, how long have you known her? Are you guys related? We're not related. And if Lily doesn't wanna talk about something, isn't that her business? Look, Lily's private, I get that's part of the deal. But she's not really been herself lately - and I was... - And who is that, exactly? Look, if anything happens to her, or if she seems stranger than normal, call this number first. Okay, but why would anything happen to her? Lily, I am so, so sorry. It's fine, don't worry about it. No, you don't understand. I rushed out of work, got home to change, wore that special shirt you bought me. You know the one with those crazy flowers on it. Oh, you mean the one that I got you as a joke? Hey, I love that shirt. I jumped in the car, switched on the GPS lady and took off. I was actually running early. Now, you know how good I am with directions. Not at all. Exactly, which is why I used the lady, but this time she's taken me out in the middle of nowhere. Every 10 seconds she's telling me to do a u-turn. Turns out I plugged in the wrong MacArthur Street. Melbourne has three of them. So I searched for the other address and speed your way. Finally, I am traveling the right direction when boom! The traffic stops. For 20 minutes we inch along, when finally I see it. What? A kitten. A kitten. Little shit wouldn't get off the road. Someone would chase it off and it would run straight back on. It had a death wish, I guess. Can cats have death wishes? So you're telling me that a kitten stopped you from coming to my graduation. Well, a kitten and my own stupidity. I'm so sorry, Lil, I really wanted to be there. It's fine, I'm here with Ali. We'll walk home together. Why don't I made you dinner? You can't even turn on your oven without giving yourself third degree burns. Skin grafts are temporary, love. This is forever. No, I'm pretty sure skin grafts are permanent, idiot. Oh, fuck. That girl's gotta have rocks for brains to fall for that nonsense. Don't talk like that about her. Why? 'Cause you wuv her? Sorry! I forgot what a noble hero you are. But I'm a damsel under much... ...distress. Will you stop? She'll be coming over later, I have to make dinner and do housework. Or... Do me, instead. So I'm guessing golden boy had another elaborate excuse? So the family are treating me to a dinner tonight. Wanna join us? Laugh at my jokes? Stop me from actually murdering them? Oh, and there is a grad after-party tonight which I'm sure is going to be highly inappropriate and far too messy. Wanna meet me there? Course not. Who am I asking? Call me later. You can jump in any time you like, you know. The anticipation of pleasure is much better than pleasure itself. Where did you get that from? I think it was a film except it was "death" and "worse" and not "pleasure" and... Fuck was that? Shit, what time is it? Okay, time to go. This isn't a game, Vi, she'll be... She'll be sad for a few hours, do some shots and get over it. Violet. Joshua. Please? You know, one of these days I might get really fucking offended. I'll call you tomorrow. Fuck, Violet. Vi. Is that you? I swear I'll wring her neck. This is not fucking funny, Vi. Before anyone says a word, please keep all conversation to a modest volume, please and thank you. Hey. Lil! I just broke my own rule. Missed you last night. As usual, things happened, then they escalated. It got apocalyptic pretty quickly. What did you do? I, ah, just had a quiet one. Really? I thought you'd be having a nice night in with the boy toy. As far as I'm concerned, the boy toy no longer exists. Oh, Lil, sorry. Do we have cake? Come join us. Hello Lily, you there? I'd love to, but I can't. I've had to head off for a day or two. Did you just go on an adventure without me? Sorry hon, but this is one I have to do on my own. You know what happens a hero leaves her sidekick behind, right? It's never good. I'll be fine. I'll be back before you can say lickety split. Lickety split. Well, fast, but not that fast, smartass. Well, call me when you get to wherever it is that you're going, okay? Love you. Love you. Is she okay? Hope so. Shit. How are ya, love? - What can we get you? - Oh! - Um... - Oh, never mind that lot. Don't get many like you out here. You know, a pretty girl away from the city rolling up stag all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? Let me guess, car ran outta juice. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, you're not the first one. See old Murray there? His car ran out of petrol 30 years ago and he never left! Um, where is the nearest petrol station? Oh, about 40k up the road? Yeah, it's been a bit of a shit since they closed that one back at Bowser. Can you imagine that? A town called Bowser doesn't even have a bloody servo. My name's Marlee. That boofhead there, he's my other half, Tom. I'm sorry. No, no, that's all right. I've got a jerrycan out the back. How far up the road are you? Oh, just a short walk. Oh, don't you worry about a thing. What's your name, sweetheart? Um, Lily. Well, Lily, we take good care of our guests up here, don't we, Marl? We do indeed. But there's something that we would like you to do for us first. This is amazing. Thank you so much. Oh, best parma in 200 kilometers. Only bloody parma in 200 kilometers. Oh shush your face. It's on the house for you, love. Are you seri, no. It's fine, I couldn't. Look, I'm just really happy to see another sheila in this place. Thank you, this is... You guys are life savers. So Lil, what are you looking for in this part of the world, then? Um, I'm looking for a house. Out here? Yeah, it's, uh, just at the end of the road on the top of the rise. The house on the hill? Is something wrong? Yeah, uh, you don't wanna go up there, love. Look, why don't we put you up here for the night? No, I wouldn't wanna put you out. Oh, it's no trouble. You're not one of them ghost hunters, are you? Ghost hunters? Yeah, yeah, well you know, a lot of folk around here are convinced that place is haunted. Why would they think that? Because anybody that goes up there, they don't come back. Squatters, kids looking for a thrill. All gone. You can't be serious. Yeah, look, uh, a young family died up there about 20 years ago. Ever since, there's been a darkness surrounding that place. We're simple, ordinary, normal folk here. All right, we might be a little kooky and set in our ways, but we're not religious, we're not superstitious and we're definitely not mad. So believe us when we say to you nothing that has gone into that house has ever come out alive again. God, that family. Lovely folks. I believe the mother was pregnant at the... What was she like? The mother. Why do you wanna know that? Ah, there was one person that came out of that house alive. You're... Oh, love. Yeah, that all right, Marl. Come on, let's get you back on the road, hey? Thanks. There we are, all right, give it a bell. Ah, there she is back from the dead. Thank you so much, I really really - appreciate it. - Nah, no probs. Listen, Lil. In case you do change your mind, there's a freeway turnoff about 30k's out of town. Take you straight back to Melbourne, okay? Hope to see you again. Hi, you've called Alice. You know the drill. The beep. Hey, Al, you there? It's Lil. I'm not sure what's happening, uh... You know, I think you're right, I shouldn't have tried to do this on my own. I'm scared, Al. I thought everything would be all right, but uh... You know, I'm sorry, I'm just being crazy. I'm here out in the middle of nowhere freaking myself out. Everything's fine. I'm fine. I'll call you tomorrow. If I survive the night in my haunted house. Hello? What? Oh, hi. Alice. I'm Lily's friend. - We met- - It's late. Yeah, sorry about that. - But Lily- - I told you to call. I know. You don't really go in for normal conversation or rhythms, do you? Or late night visitors. Lily left town really early this morning and then tonight she left me a really weird message and I haven't heard from her since. - You told me to c- - Define weird. She sounded scared. Did she say where she was going? She said something about a haunted house. I'm sure she'll be fine. Yeah, but you didn't hear the message. Yeah, but this isn't the first time she's left without warning, right? - Well no, but- - And she's more than capable of taking care of herself. - Yes, but- - It's probably a solo adventure, road trip to clear the head. She'll be back for lattes before you know it. So you're not gonna do anything. Aw, if it'll make you feel better I'll run some checks, find out where's she's at and I'll let you know. She likes skinny caps, actually. Great detail. - Thanks, Columbo. - Sorry. Do you mind if I just use your bathroom real quick? Thank you. Hello? You wouldn't. I've done more for less. You've got five seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you right now. Or call the police. I'm sorry. This is extreme behavior, even for me. I didn't mean any harm, I'm just really worried about my friend. And by the looks of it, so are you? If you're not gonna help me, I'm just gonna have to find her myself. Buy me a coffee. The first thing you need to know about Lily is people vanish around her. I've known her longer than anyone, and loss is her life's one constant. I've spent years searching for answers. I'm still looking. I'm sure Lily told you that she lost her parents at an early age. Which is the truth. But she's less chatty about her years as a foster child. At age eight, Lily ended up with the Frasers. How those fuckers got vetted by anyone is a mystery. Leonard Fraser was an alcoholic household despot who ruled his family with an iron fist. One his kids too often saw up close. Till the night he disappeared. He was missing for six days before anyone bothered to investigate. Lily was living in filth. His wife was comatose, never to emerge. What happened? Oh, at first they thought he'd finally ran off with some poor wretch he'd met at the local, but no dice. To eradicate your existence takes skill and smarts. Qualities Leonard Fraser was not famous for. After that, she got lucky for awhile. She was taken in by an older couple lovely as can be. They died just recently. Natural causes, I checked. Under them, Lily got back on track. She studied hard, got her marks up in everything but mathematics. You see, her year eight maths teacher, Mr. Edgar Cooke, was a real gem. You know, the type of teacher who marks down the prettiest girls' exams so they have to see him after class for some private tutoring. Like Fraser, Cooke vanished before he could get to our girl Lily. Coincidence? I'm not big on coincidences. And then there was the slumber party. It was the end of school, an attempt to make some friends. Didn't exactly go to plan. You've never tasted marshmallows before, Lily? Uh, nope. Okay, this is how you do it. First you take your marshmallow, then your weapon of choice. Stab it quickly through the head before it even knows what's happening. Victim number two, stab it right under the jaw. Victim three, you can play with this one. Make it really hurt. Does this have to be so macabre? Last one. That's just a mercy killing. Can't leave any witnesses. Should we be worried? I don't know, Lily, should we? What do you mean? You're an orphan, aren't you? Yeah but um... So what really happened to your parents? Sonja, maybe you should stop. Did they die some gruesome death? Is that why you don't talk about it? I, uh, I was really little at the time, I don't really remember. My mother said you were the only one there. Tell us a scary story, Lily. How did you kill your parents? You really think I killed my parents? Why don't you shut the fuck up or who knows what might happen to you. I knew she was a fucking psycho. She never told me. Lily's never spoken to anybody about what happened. The only thing we know for sure is those girls were never seen or heard from again. We think we know Lily. She's quiet, determined, lost. We feel the need to protect her, save her from harm. But all those traumatic experiences, they must have had an effect. What if, that night, she just snapped? You're nuts. I have to look at it from every angle. Work the evidence, and where there is none all I've got is motive, opportunity and circumstance. And when I put those into the slot machine, all three come up Lily. Lily might be weird, but she's also the kindest, sweetest person I've ever met. There's no way she could hurt anyone, let alone... Let alone stab four girls to death while they sleep. You would be shocked how normal a killer can seem. You know Karl Denke? The butcher who sold his customers human flesh? He was a regular churchgoer and a pillar of his community. He even played the organ for special services. I don't buy it, sorry. How could she of even disposed of the bodies? They were in an abandoned house out in the middle of nowhere. The surrounding woods would've been a perfect place to dispose of something you didn't want found. You're delusional. You must have had a wonderful childhood to think so well of humanity. Lily saw her parents slain when she was barely three. Something like that, it leaves a residue. Isn't that all the more reason why we should be protecting her? It's my job to protect everyone. That boyfriend of hers. What's his story? Ex-boyfriend. Interesting. He went missing three days ago. So the idea is to arrest Lily? The idea is to find her and hopefully find out what's going on. Well I'm coming with you. No, you're not. Too many lives have been lost already, do you really think Lily will forgive me if I put yours in danger? Look, I'm sorry, I will do everything I can to try to protect her, but this is just something I have to do alone. You sound just like Lily. Okay, you know what? Fuck it, you were right. That whole sleepover thing has got me freaked out. You just let me know as soon as you find her, yeah? Yeah, of course. Having someone call your best friend - a murderer is hectic. - I didn't call her a murderer. Well no, but you have to entertain the possibility. I get it. Okay. So when are you heading off? I'm just curious. I'll be leaving in the morning. Great, good luck. I'm calling the police, go away! Stop! Enough! Okay, so I may have gone a little too far. You think? You are just driving, you are not helping, influencing or getting involved in this case in any way, do you understand? Please tell me you understand. Sorry, just... Sorry. Sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay, it's okay. I look after the house, I'm not gonna... Lily? Is it really you? The lawyer didn't tell you about me? The lawyer didn't tell me much about anything. Do you live here? No. I wasn't considered part of the family. Did you know my parents? It was a very long time ago. I do remember your mother though, a little. She was a very beautiful woman. Not unlike yourself. What was she like? I think maybe I should show you something. This place looks like it's been shut for 100 years. She might not be in her glory days, but there's life in the old girl yet. And we're here because? I wanna make sure I'm on the right track. Senior Constable, you know I don't put my face on before 12. It's good to see you, Marlee. It's good to see you too, Jane. Come here. Come on in. Little Marlee over there, she had dreams of a rock and roll lifestyle. And she lived it for one glorious summer. Rode the bus to the big smoke and vowed never to come back. Until one day her mom got sick and her dad couldn't run this place without her. And she's been back behind that bar ever since. Doesn't matter how far you run, the past will always catch up with you. - Oh, Tom. - There we are. You legend. Ah, you put Melbourne baristas to shame. Ever thought of taking your skills on the road? What, leave all of of this? Yeah, he knows which side his bread's buttered on, don't you, sweetness? - Thanks, darling. - Ah, draft on tap - wins every time. - It does. So we saw an apparition yesterday. Back from the dead? Yep, wind's begun to howl again. Since when? Aw, three or four nights ago. Before or after the ghost sighting? It started the moment she arrived. Yeah. You know there's... There's gotta be something darker out there than just some lost little lamb, you know. Perhaps the lamb's become the wolf. We both know that's not what you believe, Jane. Yeah. Anyway, so why are you here? That's why you've always been here. And we're kinda glad you are, because I reckon one way or the other, she's gonna need you. This is who you are. How does a three-year-old recover from that? We all thought she was so young she'd forget it all. I did my best, but... Witnessing all that so young must fuck up your circuitry somehow. Maybe it scrambled her for good. You can't really believe that, can you? I'm just hoping it's not too late. I've always been here for you, Lily. What... What did you do to her? She tried to hide you from me. But you were mine to protect, mine to raise, mine to love. Lily, come on, it's time to go. Grab my hand, sweetheart. Come on, we have to go, Lily, grab my hand. You're a monster. She tried to hide you from me. I couldn't let you be raised by someone so willingly vindictive. I've been protecting you ever since. All these people you killed because of me. For you, for you! This is... This is insane. They were worth nothing. Only you matter to me. I've never missed a concert, a game, a play, a graduation. I've always been there for you. I have always watched over you. What is that? It's your graduation present. Open the door. Lily. Why are you... So Joshy boy here has been running around on you. That night you finished your last exam, you remember, he suddenly had a 24-hour stomach bug? Turns out he was fucking some girl he met at the pub. He got lost so often you bought him a GPS. He was lost in other girls' vaginas. Every time he left a gig you weren't at, every time he was late, every time he missed a date he was sleeping with another woman. Don't worry. I looked after her for you. For 20 years I've looked out for you. But now it's time for you to show me that you can look after yourself. Starting now. You can do it. I'm right behind you. Dad? Yes, honey? I think I can do this on my own. I'm ready. I'm sorry. Oh, God! Oh, God, Lily! I'm so sorry. I'm not a bad person, I'm just weak and stupid and a terrible man and I promise you that I'll... Ah! I saved you because I'm not a psycho, not because I'm a fucking idiot. Now let's go. - Lily, wait, wait! - Come on. - What? - We can't just leave him there alive. He'll come after us, you should've killed him when you had the chance. Fine, okay, go, I'll take care of it and just don't stop until you find the nearest police station. Over there. Fuck! That was Josh, right? Yeah. Stay here. Please. Lily? Lily, he's all right. Lily! Are you okay? Lily! Lily? You want more? Keep it up! Shit. Hey, hey. Wake up. Hey, wake up. No, wake up. No, wake up, wake up, wake. Hey, hey. Okay, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey, are you okay? Are you? Just give me this. It'll be okay. It's okay. Okay, okay, you have to stay here. Okay, you gotta stay here and I'll be back in a second, okay? I'm gonna be right back. Let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go! Hey, hey! She won't hurt me. No, she would never, never, never hurt me. I keep trying to get rid of her, she keeps coming back. She's here risking her life because she loves me. So you don't have to hurt anyone anymore. Okay? We can start over. No, no, please, Dad. Please, Dad, no, just let her go, just let her go, just let her go. No, please, Dad, okay I'll do anything. Okay? I'll do anything. Just not her, just not h... No, no. I'll do anything, okay? Okay, please. Please. Please, there. There, it's gone. Please, Dad, please, Dad, no, let her go. Let her go, okay? No, please. Hey, are you gonna be all right? You're not gonna get rid of me that easily. Promise? At least we've got blankets.
