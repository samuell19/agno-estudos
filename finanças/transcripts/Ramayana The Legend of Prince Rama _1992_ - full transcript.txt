anyone else had had the gall to speak to me like this I'd have killed him on the spot I king Ravan who has won the obedience of all men and the praises of the Gods you expect me to shiver from fear of a mere princely begone treacherous one get out get out of my sight how do we cross over to the other side we will need thousands of boats for these great troops and we can build a bridge a bridge do you know how many years it will take to construct such a long bridge Sita to be rescued I'd fly to Lanka and accomplish the mission myself quite easily we have to rescue not only Sita but others too Ravan must be destroyed or else there will be no lasting peace on earth listen all of you a demon names mission a brother of Ravan comes in peace seeking refuge he disagreed with his brother and protected me in Robins palace I have observed his honesty later for myself I see no Thornton is joining our forces I agree with Hanuman al amongst friends bless me England I have overheard your discussion on how to cross over to Lanka I'd like to suggest you pray to the sea God and ask him for his home that's good advice revision for seven days and seven nights ROM trade to the sea god it's dawn the God revealed himself righteous Rob build a bridge with stones inscribe your name on each stone stones will not sink to the ocean instead they will support not only monkeys but all the living creatures the mountains and the Seas shall help you build this bridge and the gods will bless you with success now let's start members of the council we are facing an outbreak of war what do you have to say brass you as the Great Lord of Lanka he looked have called this council just to consider this ridiculous threat from a handful of men and monkeys just send a couple of my men who not even present at this council and they will surely wipe out Rams army Robin I told you before but now I have to repeat it those who govern the kingdom should never be swayed by flattery the Army's attacking us are no ordinary ones Jarvan I'll tell you this for your own good return Sita she is the wife of the Prince of Ionia grandfather why do we have to return her now if we release her now they would think that we are all afraid of fighting it is not so I cannot bear the sight of so many people injured and even more dead just for this one woman grandfather that means you are afraid of fighting if you're scared of bloodshed how can you fight Indrajit I am no coward but yes I don't want to fight unnecessarily you called me all wrong yes brave prince of the vomitus please listen to what I have to say carefully for these many months I've been thinking only of defeating Robin now my dream is about to come true however I have considered this matter over and over again I have concluded that I can stop this fight even now if my wife Sita and other captives are released and they ask for shelter under me you are no doubt surprised but the shedding of blood should be avoided and real beasts should come back to the three wells to ensure this I am ready to forgive and forget the misdeeds of Robin Angad could you carry this message to rather I I understand I will surely convey your message to Robin thank you anger is that all you have to say to me Oh Helen I'm good that's your name isn't it here's my answer how despicable is this how you treat a messenger who comes in peace Robin I have your answer and now I will carry you answer - rum the next time I see you it will be on the battlefield so rather than once war after all I understand under that I appreciate your endeavor I'm sorry rum Robin did not accept your message of peace I did my best now tomorrow morning and the first rays of the Sun touched the mountaintops the battle will begin I ask all of you present here will you fight for justice and for armed I pray to you O God I pray to you please please protect drum protect my husband oh this is bothering me the day began well for us Oh King but now the two armies seem equally matched our men are beginning to tire let them be draw at once then and rest a while respected one that will only lead to our defeat let us send kumbhakarna sons combinely khumba the tired soldiers can fall back to defense but we shall keep up the pressure on the enemies until sunset yes at sunset Rahm will stop the battle for the day to tend to the wounded and to cremate the dead with honor good I will send forth combine the khumba yeah yeah I come monkey stop it here majesty khumba Macumba are fighting with great courage on the battlefield well after all they are the sons of Kumbakonam so many dead so many wounded you fought bravely I'm so proud of you that rest oh no such a tiny wound will be cured by tomorrow you'll see oh do not strain yourself rest yes brother how could you cremate the bodies of our enemies along with those of our own soldiers lux when they were our men and Robin's men while they were alive but in death they are no longer enemies do they not all of them deserve a solemn cremation it is not like a true warrior a true satria to be moved by such a motion my brother when we set out of this expedition I too was full of anger and bitterness but on our journey to Lanka I have come to see that all of us have received the precious gift of life from the gods and it is more important to be a good human being than to be just a good Kshatriya have we not all of us sprung from the same source raksha's vana man-beast birds of the air the fish of the ocean yet some of us innate neurons draw their bows and swords against their fellow creatures many have fallen on this battlefield today and many more shall die before the war is done and as a Kshatriya i shall continue to fight my battles and I burned the dead I shall pray for a world free from all wars where a man does not raise his hand in anger against his own brother words fail me I am deep General of the Vanaras trial you can I shall defeat you let us see you have fought well but this is the end wait Kumba kuba my brother are you really gone is it you is it you kill my brother Kumba yes I am I am so grieve the king of the Vanaras yeah your brother Kumba was really brave and courageous I have never met such a mighty opponent before I am very impressed by statics he's chromatin with honor if does it what are you saying but a husband have both been killed yes Father it is unfortunate but true I never thought Rams army had anyone to match them it is time to review our strategy it cannot be helped under the circumstances in rigid aroused Kumbakonam from his sleep what Kumba an Akuma fought so hard now Kondo Karen their father and a warrior ten times mightier than they can work wonders yes I'm right wake him up immediately this is my command yes you're right father I will the bishop who's Jeff tempted what that bomb is the best and the bravest warrior of Garvin's troops from the government after six months sleep he would have become immortal but it seems to me that rather than forced him to wake up earlier because he was in terror to see so many of his soldiers killed one after the other oh yes he needs Kumbhakarna but even he is not immortal he's only mighty enough to make all the Vanaras soldiers run away in panic by his very appearance but from now is the right moment for you to go to battle now but you have courage you are a kinsman of the Vanara King no wonder you fight so great but this is as far as you get against me wait this is now my mission I see you are kumbhakarna the mightiest warrior of Lanka now this Hanuman is your opponent good good but before we fight our mom thank you for your consideration I won't fight you with bare hands because you're skillful enough to fight with weapons and get honest Oh it was good for you I lost my mace now get up and fight wait stop wherever you are I am around the Prince of IOT son of Dashrath give us to you you are a skillful swordsman go away it has drawn dark and even with

Sita my queen that's fun come come over here take cover before I dispose of you rom I will give you enough time to hold a funeral for your wife and your brother Sita may I talk with you for a moment we have almost used up all the herbs around this area but they don't heal the wounds inflicted by Indrajith at all what news is this oh god oh god I have already lost my beloved wife Sita and now I'm going to lose my dear brother Lakshman if I lose what else would be left for me brace yourself wrong you cannot grieve and threat like this your despair will damage the morale of our troops more than the enemy's arrows please do not worry Ram Sita surely must be alive alive but I saw Sita slain before my very eyes I know it must be one of Indrajit magic tricks magic trick yes and we must not allow his tricks to perplex us your grief will only give him strength Indrajit strength lies in his magical powers the only way to take these powers away from him is to attack indrajith while he performs his tantric rites in the cave of nickim villa Indrajit makes it a rule to perform a religious ceremony he offers sacrifices to the goddess nickim dealer from the evening hours way until nightfall he gains his extraordinary magical powers through this ceremony I see no we still have so many soldiers wounded my brother Lakshman for instance no I think it'll be very hard for us to attack the container cave now yes the Himalayas what about them you rest back jump around talk to me and I know there are some loves there that can heal our wounds in the mullahs malleus I'm afraid I'm afraid

remember what you said so given the patient the new king of Lanka presents Rama and Sita at the vimana the flying chariot to return to our Thea as they return Sita gazes around with mixed feelings happy to be reunited with him after a long period of separation and sorrowful - for the precious lives lost for her sake in the avoidable war a yogya celebrates the safe return of the beloved king and they live happily thereafter a few years later brown returns to the heavens and SATA returns to mother earth
