Put it in me brain. - I couldn't play the drums then. - You can't play the fucking drums anyway. Bollocks! And speaking of cunts who can't play. Hello, girls. Where'd you get your perms? You're all Rod Stewart look-alikes. - You fuckin' tick. - Any chance of lending your mascara? I don't mean to be mundane or anything, but I either need the drugs or the money. I'm broke. I need it. It's 50 quid. Fuck you! - Sounds like Gary Glitter! - Shit. You get the fuck out! Mr. Rotten, I'm so pleased... Four more pints, Sid. - What do you think of Northern Ireland? - It's all right where it is. What's the matter? Are you all right? No! Why? Do I look all right? That fucker in there ripped me off for 50 quid. Fuckin' scumbag. What, he stole it from your purse? Yeah, almost. I mean, I gave it to him the first night I was here. Fuck. It's embarrassing.

Give me all your money. Here. - There. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, great. I'll be back in an hour. See you here. At the pub. - Sid, you coming for a pint? - Eh? - Oi, you fuckin' Wally, shut the door. - Fuck off, tosser. No, I'm waitin' for this bird. Fucking-A, man. What's her name? - Nancy. - Nancy?

I'm thinkin' of startin' up this club. Oh, yeah? What you gonna call it? Wally's Gaff. Oh, that's really good. That must have taken you ages to think that up. Well, it's got a certain ring of street cred about it. "Oh, let's all go to Wally's Gaff and have a lager." Seven pounds, 49 pence. Water... 12.50. - Where you gonna get all the money for this? - Get a mortgage. Rod Stewart at 2:00. Oi, you wankers! Wanker! Go through that door. Climb to the top of the stairs. Don't speak to anyone. Ask for Ashraf. And don't let her keep you waiting. Why do I have to go? I got a broken heel. And don't get burned. I hate to wait. Get me out of here! - What about that chick's gear? - Jettison. - All right, Rod? - All right, Rod? - What's in this? - Here, they're your mum's. - Look at that. - What are these for? Motherfuckers! My clothes! Hey, you, where's my money? Shit! Goddamn! - Look, I gave you some money the other day. - Help me. Shit. What about my money? Listen, I'm talking to you... - Shut up and help me! - I ought to smash your face in. - All my fucking stuff is all wet! - Listen! What about my drugs? Here. Um, sorry about the mess. It's these skinheads, see? We've seen them off though. You can't run drugs on the sidewalk, Johnny. What are you, an idiot? - I'm Sid. - Do you wanna use my gaff? - What's a gaff? - Me house. Me apartment. He's a club owner. - Where's the fish and chips? - What fish and chips? The fish and chips that you promised to buy us. Why don't we just go in? No, see, he lets us in and then we do the drugs, and then he goes and gets the fish and chips. But I wanna do some of the drugs. Yeah, well, you will. We'll save you some. Cheers. This is where the bouncers are gonna stand. Wally. Like, I was at CBGB's at this audition, right? So this guy says, "Can you sing like Debbie Harry?" It's a bad deal looking like an established star, let me tell you that. I mean, I like Debbie. We're really good friends, actually. - You've done this before, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Good veins. Where you going? You know. Know what? What? Don't you want me to? No. Ow! Wally! ~ We don't fucking care ~ No. No "fucking." It's just, "We don't care." Ow. Be careful. - Pizza time! - Pizza, my favorite food. - So what are you waiting for, playback? - Oh, I like pizza. How many tracks have you laid? None. We ain't done no songs either. - Why not? - Sid's still learning it. - Sid, what are you doing? - I'm eating. No, you can't have any pizza till you finish at least one song. - Yes, I can. - No, I'm serious. What? What are you doing here? You're in the studio. These places cost, like, 50 grand a minute. You could be really shining out. But what? You're just wonkin' off. Wankin'. What happened to you? Did you try and kiss your mother? None of your business. John got beaten up by fascists. - Five minutes to last orders. - Bye. - I'm gonna get pissed. - Fuck off. Want some pizza, Johnny? "Want some pizza, Johnny?" Doesn't like to be called Johnny. Likes to be called John. See ya, Johnny. Fuckin' cabbies, that's what we should be. Make 200 quid a night being a cabbie. Why don't you fuck off and be one then? 'Cause it'd take 18 months to learn. You need a driving license too. And a set of golf clubs. See ya. I don't think Johnny likes me. He doesn't like anyone. He's a fool. You like me, don't you? - Huh? Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Kiss my toes. You want me to? Yeah. ~ God save the queen ~ ~ The fascist regime ~ ~ They make you a moron ~ Pizza time! Hey, Johnny. I'm gonna have a tattoo on my head... "Brain damage." Sidney, get ahold of that. Come inside, you fuckers. Why can't he puke over the side? That's why we have photographers. We need an explosion. Where are you going, Sidney? Oh, Malcky walcky. Give me some money. Sidney, as a Sex Pistol, all your human needs are seen to... food, beer, designer wardrobe. - Why do you need money? - Oh, I don't know. Little things round the house. What sort of little things? What are those bruises on your arms? I fell over. - Leave him alone. - Yes, leave me alone. This man is violent! That's my boy. That's your camera there, number two. I give you full... completely full, free reign. You dirty fucking bastard. - You dirty fucker. - Good heavens! What a fucking rafter. What a naughty, naughty boy. Is this your girlfriend, Sid? - We both are. - You gonna give us any money for this? - Fucking villain. - Brenda! - Think of a name for my baby. - Bastard. Good, huh? Sid, look. Look! Hey, that's really cool. Hey, where's the key? What key? Your mum says you're a nice boy. Any comment? Nancy! Not my hair! Bloody hell! ~ I am an antichrist ~ ~ I am an anarchist ~ ~ Don't know what I want But I know how to get it ~ ~ I wanna destroy passersby ~ ~ Cause ~ ~ Wanna be ~ ~ Yeah, anarchy ~ ~ No dogsbody ~ ~ Anarchy for the UK ~ ~ It's coming sometime, maybe ~ ~ I give the wrong time Stop a traffic line ~ ~ Your future dream is a shopping ~ I didn't know pigs could swim. He got nailed! Mom, guess what. We got married. Me and Sid. Sid Vicious. You remember. From the Sex Pistols. Hello, Mom. Hello. What? No. You'll love him too. Yeah. Yeah. So So, uh, anyway, why don't you send us a wedding present for our honeymoon? Oh, a wedding present! Yeah. - Well, I have a lot of sheets and towels, or... - No. We don't need any sheets. Why don't you send us some money? Well, it's early there, right? So you could go to American Express, like, right now before it closes and send us $200, and then Sid could pick it up here tomorrow, like, first thing when they open. Nancy, listen to me. I'm not sending... Why not? - You are not... - I am so married. - You 're not married, because if you... - I am! What do you mean? He loves me more than you do! Yes, I am! - No! Shut up! - You 're on drugs right now! Listen to me! If you don't send us the money right now, we're both gonna fucking die! - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Stop it! Fuck you! I fuckin' hate them! I fucking hate them! Fucking motherfuckers! They wouldn't send us any money! They said we'd spend it on drugs! Well, we would! ~ You better understand I'm in love with myself ~ ~ Myself ~ ~ My beautiful self ~ ~ And no feelings ~ ~ And no feelings ~ ~ And no feelings for anybody else ~ ~ Hello and good-bye To Runaround Sue ~ ~ You follow me around Like a pretty pot' of glue ~ ~ I kick you in the head You've got nothing to say ~ ~ Get out of my way Cause I gotta getaway ~ ~ You never realize I take the piss out of you ~ ~ You come up and see me And I'll beat you black and blue ~ I'm bored! Could be standing over at Lions and, like, pulling. Punks don't go out pulling. They go to fucking boring gigs like this. That's what it's all about. I ain't gonna be a punk no more. What you gonna be then, Clive? A skinhead? I'm gonna be a rude boy, like my dad. ~ There ain't no moonlight after midnight ~ ~ I see you silly people Out looking for delight ~ ~ Well, I'm so happy and feeling so fine ~ ~ I'm watching all the rubbish You're wasting my time ~ ~ I look around your house You've got nothing to steal ~ ~ I kick you in the brains When you get down and kneel ~ ~ And pray ~ ~ You pray to your god ~ - Phoebe. How would you like to supervise our Sidney for a month or two? - No way. - Go on. You'd be a good influence on the boy. - Why not? - Infectious hepatitis, loony girlfriend, drugs. Boys will be boys. It's time he went back to his mum's. ~ Your daddy's gone away Be back another day ~ ~ See his picture hangin' on your wall ~ Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck it! - What? What's the matter? - Fuck it! I can't find it. My action man. You mean GI Joe. I had it in me hand five minutes ago. I've had it since I was a kid. It's very valuable. I want to kill. Wait, flying in, Telly Savalas. Oh, no! He's drowning! We tried to save him, but it's too late. I used to have a special hair Barbie. You mean Sindy, Nancy. No, I mean Barbie, Sidney. I'll never look like Barbie. Barbie doesn't have bruises. Sid, look at this. I look disgusting. Look, Nancy. Why don't you do these dishes, please, eh? What? What did you say to me? - Oh, fuck it. I'll do 'em meself. - Good. What's the matter, Sid? Did you do a little speed or something? Nope. I was bored. I'm bored now. - Where's the bloody soap? - Up your ass. - Shh... - Oh, I better cover this up. - Somebody could see it. - Shit. Christ. My mum's gonna be home, so stop mucking about. Oh, what's the difference? Yeah, but it's the least I can do, what with her risking her life every day as a motorcycle messenger. Oh, God, if you were earning half of what you were worth, you'd buy your mom a fucking army, you prick! Well, why don't you shut your fucking mouth? If it weren't for me mum's kindness, we'd be on the fucking streets! Yeah, and if it weren't for your own stupidity, we'd be living in our own apartment in Paris, France. - Get off the fucking bed! - No! Look at this shit! Can you believe this? Okay, look. Stop it now. Come on, we've both had fun now. Take that off. It's my mummy's. - Look, it will tear. - Oh, I thought it was yours. Ow! - Fuck you! - Get pissed off when the going gets tough? - Fuck you! - Insult me only fucking mother! - Fuck you both. - All right, Mum? - You love her more than me! - Yeah, I fucking do and all!

What are you doing up so early in the afternoon? I've come to see my best mate. - He's in his boudoir. - Is he out of it? Hey, Linda. You know you've got a man hangin' from your ceiling? Don't mind him. He's one of my customers, Edward. Just abuse him now and again, and he'll be as good as gold. Don't hurt me, for God's sake. Don't hurt me. I'll do anything you want, but I implore you not to hurt me, please. Sidney! Wakey, wakey! Sid, wake up, dear. Sidney, wake up. Fuck off, John. Oh, I'm sorry I kicked you, Sidney. It was an accident. Leave us alone. Look, I've got two tickets for Rock Head at the Rainbow. It'll do you good to go and see him. I hear he's cleaned up his act. Don't do any drugs or drink... hardly. And he's all the better for it. I know Rock Head. I bet you do. Rock Head's got the best drugs. Let's go see Rock Head. Here, John, mate, make us a cup of tea. You're funny. I don't even want to be here. Yes, madam. The Sex Pistols for Mr. Head. What a fuckin' palace. - I wish I lived here. - Mr. Head's room, please. Rock. Rock, you big head. Hi, uh, uh... - Peggy, ain't it? - Nancy. And this is Sid Vicious and Johnny. They're from the Sex Pistols. Impress them with your drugs. Drugs? Do we have any drugs, boys? Rock Head does not do drugs. Right. Don't be so fucking stingy. Pull out the drawer. We'll have a Bible reading. - Give me five pounds. - Fuck off. Uh, look, you want some water? I got some with bubbles in it. How about some room service, Mr. Head? Fuck off. Uh, Jennifer, ring for a cart. Fuck him, Sidney. His drugs were garbage anyway. They were not. - Lend us five pounds. - Hello, room service. So, it appears we are related. Eh? The press, they're calling me the Big Daddy of Punk. Your role model. Lovely couple. Fuck you, Rock Head. What the fuck are you doing here anyway? I'm gonna fucking puke. For Christ's sake, Malcolm, I know we're not great shakes, but the bass player has to keep the beat. We have to turn his amp off half the time. He'll be playing one thing, we'll be playing a-fucking-nother. Lads, I sympathize. But Sidney's more than a mere bass player. He's a fabulous disaster. He's a symbol, a metaphor. He embodies the dementia of a nihilistic generation. He's a fucking star. He's a fucking head case. - Shut up. - Phoebe! Enough. Talk some shit. I'll fight on, sugar. - Yeah. - Sidney's not the problem. - The problem, as you are all aware... - It's "Spunkin." She wants you to book them a suite at... - Wait. Where? - I want a suite as well. Rock Head's hotel. They can't stay here much longer. The police were around here yesterday. Arrests were made. Substances confiscated. - They've even been hanging out of the windows! - What rubbish. This is a respectable hotel, madam. Lillie Langtry has stayed here. Phoebe! Hi! Sid. Sid, we've got company. We gotta go. Let me up. Whoa! Sid! Nancy! Sid! - Stay where you are! - Stay where you are. I'm loaded. - Are you all right, Nancy? - Oh, yeah. We're just having fun. It's Lurch. You want a cup of tea? Get us a cup of tea! - More sugar, you cunt. - We have no roof service. - You're dead. - Look, we ain't got time for tea. He's got to practice. He's got a tour coming up. - No. - No, I don't wanna go. I wanna stay here and have a really good screw. - Sid. Sid. - And apple pies. Four words... no women on the tour. That's five words. No way, Malcolm. No fucking way. Yeah, right. There's no way. Look, it's purely financial. We can't afford a... an entourage. I'm not an entourage. I know what you're feeling. I know how important your relationship is. But if you two wanna stay together, we'll just have to find another bass player. Sid Vicious is the Sex Pistols. Bollocks. Oh, yeah, that's right. You can't leave me behind. Paul wouldn't stand for it. We're the rhythm section. Paul. Look, it's only a month. You can live that long without each other, can't you? And if you do survive, I have been talking to the record company. They're going to buy you a little house. Oh. How lovely for you. - You think I'm an asshole, don't you? - Yes, I do. You really think you can buy Sid off of me? Fuck you. Take him. I only want what's best for Sidney. I don't wanna go on your fucking tour anyhow. I got my own stuff to do. Paul. Paul. Sid. What are you doing? - Sid. - What? Stay awake. These are our last two hours together. Stay awake. What for? So I can talk to you. So we can fuck some more. So we can be together. Yeah, but we are together. Come on, give me a break, eh? Oh. You give me a break. I'm the one that's getting left behind. Kiss my toes. Oh, fuck off. Fuck you. Fuck this! Fuck this! Jesus! - Sid, what are you doing? - Christ. What are you doing? Stop this. Sid, come back. - I'm going to the airport. - No, come back. I'm gonna be early for once. Do you know what I mean? Sid, stop this. I'm sorry. - Fuckin'... - Stop. Come back. What are you doing? - Sid. Sid, don't be a jerk. - Fucking sick of you. Fuck it, Sid. Don't leave! Sid! What about the farewell drugs? Sid! Oi, how do you spell "holiday"? S-H-I-T. "Dear Mum, having a lovely..."

I'm in America! Oh, God, I can't believe you called. I thought you'd hate me forever. I've really been going crazy for you. I miss you so much. - I miss you too. - Yeah? Well, how's America?

A spokesman for his record company said Vicious was suffering from nervous exhaustion. A hippie! Sid, it's a French hippie. Dear Mum, guess where your Simon is turned up? - Since you can't guess, I will tell yo u. - What's it like, man? - Paris, in the spring. - Oh, and the Eiffel Tower! Sid is recording here, and he is brilliant. We go shopping every day. Sid bought me lots of underwear, and it is all French. You 'd love it here. - Lots of love, from Nancy and Sid. - Nancy! Sid! Sidney, long time no see. Hugh Kares. We met at Trumps. You remember. Huh? No, he doesn't. Sid... This is my girlfriend, Nancy. - Hi, Nancy. - Let's go. Let's take lunch, you know, go to... Get yourself a chair and sit down. Shut up. Everything's crazy for me right now, but, Sid, I've always got time for you, babe. Oh! Ooh! Oh, Jesus Christ. Get it out. Get it out, Sidney. That's all right. That's all right. Oh, dude! Get it all out. Come on. Oh, geez. - When you're feeling better, Sid... - He's feeling fine. - You're making him sick. Let's go. - When you're feeling better, call me, Sidney. Sid, let's go. Fuck him. We'll leave him with the check. You're gonna make somebody a lot of money, Sidney! ~ And now ~ ~ The end is near ~ ~ And so I face ~ ~ The final curtain ~ Ha-ha-ha! ~ You cunt ~ ~ I'm not a queer ~ ~ I'll state my case ~ ~ Of which I'm certain ~ ~ I've lived ~ ~ A life that's full ~ ~ And each ~ ~ And every highway ~ ~ And more ~ ~ Much more than this ~ ~ I did it my way ~ ~ Regrets ~ ~ I've had a few ~ ~ But then again ~ ~ Too few to mention ~ ~ I did ~ ~ What I had to do ~ ~ I saw it through ~ ~ Without exception ~ ~ I planned ~ ~ Each charted course ~ ~ Each careful step ~ ~ Along the highway ~ ~ And more ~ ~ Much more than this ~ ~ I did it my way ~ ~ There were times ~ ~ I'm sure you knew ~ ~ When there was fuck ~ ~ Fuck, fuck-all else to do ~ ~ But through it all ~ ~ When there was doubt ~ ~ I shot it up ~ ~ Or kicked it out ~ ~ I faced 'em all ~ ~ And the world ~ ~ And did it my way ~ ~ I've loved ~ ~ And then a snide ~ ~ I've had my fill ~ ~ My share of losing ~ ~ And now ~ ~ The tears subside ~ ~ I find it all ~ ~ So amusing ~ ~ To think ~ ~ I killed a cat ~ ~ And may I say ~ ~ Not in the die way ~ ~ Oh, no ~ ~ No, no, not me ~ ~ I did it my way ~ It seems like all my friends are dead. When I'm dead, will you be sad? I couldn't live without you. - You couldn't? - No. We better go together then. How should we do it? We could... jump off a building. Throw ourselves under a subway. OD. If I asked you to kill me... would you? What would I do? I couldn't live without you. You'd kill yourself too then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shit. I hate this fucking life. No, this is... This is just a rough patch. Things will be much better when we get to America, I promise. We're in America. What? We've been here a week. New York is in America, you fuck. What? Couldn't be. A week? Yeah. What day is it? Oh, shit. Is it Tuesday or Wednesday? We're supposed to be at Grandma and Grandpa's on Wednesday. Where's my fuckin' book? Shit. God. No! Look! There's the Rollerama! Sid, I won a roller-skating trophy there when I was six years old. - Nancy, don't fib. - Fuck you, Grandma. Oh, no! This place is a fucking paradise. You guys gotta come see us in New York when I get Sid some gigs. - Can't he cut his own meat? - They really want him at Max's. They're too fuckin' cheap. They only wanna pay him three grand. I mean, he's worth five at least. Sid's a really big star in New York. We both are. Yeah, yeah. I mean, God, we barely have any time to ourselves. We don't even have time to get to the methadone clinic. We've only got enough for two days. Grandma, can I borrow the car? I wanna teach Sid how to drive American. Mom, how come Nancy gets to borrow Grandma's car and I don't? She's the one who got fucked up and wrecked it. - Shut up. - What do you know, crater face? Fuckin' twerp. Too bad about your brothers, Mary Jane. Still taking idiot lessons? Mm-hmm. So, are you gonna make an honest woman out of our Nancy, Sid? Well, she's always been honest to me. Grandpa, sir. She's never lied to me. But, um, what are your, uh, intentions? Well, first off, we're gonna go down to the methadone clinic on Monday, and then Nancy's gonna get me some gigs. And then we're gonna go off and, like, live in Paris and just sort of go out in a blaze of glory. Yeah, but don't worry. You'll be proud of us. So, why don't we go down to the rec room? ~ Fuck this and fuck that ~ ~ Fuck it all You fuckin', fuckin' brat ~ ~ I don't want a baby who looks like that ~ ~ She don't want a baby That looks like that ~ ~ Body ~ ~ A fucking animal ~ Oh, that's... That's an old one. So, what else should we do, huh? Oh, no more. No more. I'm tired. I wanna go noddy-blinkums. Whose bedroom are we sleepin' in? Actually, dear, you're not staying here. We thought it would be more fun for you to stay downtown at the Sunshine Inn. No. What about French toast and blintzes? You don't want to come back here for breakfast. Your bus leaves at 9:17. But we're staying another day. Grandpa and I must have misunderstood. See, we're, uh... We're going out of town tomorrow. The whole family is going out of town. - I didn't know we were going anywhere. - Shut up, Chipper! Be quiet, Chipper. Oh, that's all right. Can we come? No, Nancy, you just can't. Well, will you at least drive us to the motel? Of course. And we'll give you money for a taxi for tomorrow morning. You'll get to the bus in plenty of time. Here. Darling, it was lovely to see you. Here. - Here, take... - Sid. What? I can't just leave him there. These people, they 're really lovely. Best fuckin' food I ever ate. So why'd they throw us out? 'Cause they know me. Can you move your foot? - You know about the Golden Triangle? - Yeah. That's where the heroin comes from. Heard about it when I was in the 'Nam. - You heard of Vietnam, right? - Yup. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, while us guys was fightin' and dyin' and gettin' all fucked up... the CIA was flyin' the shit out of there and into here with our planes. You know who paid for that shit? We did. That is, the government. You know why? 'Cause smack is the great controller. Keeps the people stupid when they could be smart. - What's he on about? - Some bullshit politics. You guys got no right to be strung out on that stuff. You could be selling healthy anarchy. But long as you're addicts, you'll be full of shit. Come on, Vito. Don't be such a jerk. I just don't know how many people want to see Vicious on his own. Are you kidding? - Sid Vicious is a major... - He's not gonna be on his own. He's gonna have a great fuckin' backup band behind him. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Who? - Who? Iggy, Dee Dee, Chrissie, Debbie. Debbie Harry singing backup. It's true! Johnny Thunders, Joe Strummer... - I love you, Nancy. You're a fuckin' nutcase. - Stiv Bators, Jerry Nolan. I'm running a business here. - You really think he can pull this off? - Yes! - Can he play? - He can! Shit, he practices all the time, right? Vito, come on, please. Give us a gig. You want me to fuck you? No. And you shouldn't offer. It's not professional. All right. I'll give you three grand for three gigs. All right! Okay. - Deal. - Deal. Sid! Sid! Hey, Max. Sid! Sid, guess what! Sid, I did it! I got you three gigs at Max's! At least three, maybe more! Are you excited? - Yeah. - What? Sid? What? What's goin' on? - We were just jamming, you know? - And watching Trigger. What is... What is this? Sid! Did you give him this? - Fuckin' come on. - No way. - Sid. - I just came here to jam, all right? - Just be cool. - Don't tell me to be cool. Sid! Sid, we had a deal. We said we weren't gonna do any more smack until after the gig, you asshole, you fucking jerk! Shit! I can't fucking decide where to fucking throw you! We had a deal. We said we weren't gonna do any smack till after the gig! And you don't even save me any, you fuckhead! Shit, you asshole, motherfucking jerk! Ow! Sid! Sid, you're the fuckhead! Hey, what the fuck is going on? Oh, shit. Is he all right? No, he's a fucking asshole junkie. - Fuckhead. - Don't fucking kick him. You're really gonna love this place. A lot of great artists stay here. I want you to stay a long time. Let's take him to my room. It's a couple of my foreign exchange students. Why don't we just get to the elevator?

Sid doesn't need to rehearse. He's a natural. - Yeah, a natural fuckup. - Get it together, Sid. - You just gotta learn the words. - Words. It's not words.
