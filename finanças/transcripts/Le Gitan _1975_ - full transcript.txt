BASED ON THE NOVEL "HISTOIRE DE FOU" BY JOSÉ GIOVANNI Are you the Sennarts? Excuse me. Mr. Sennart? Yes? We're looking for your son, Hugo. We know he came back. He never left. So where is he? In here. If you're helping him, you'll pay the price. You know that? There were a lot of them. I think they're scared. Hugo Sennart, also known as the Gypsy. The Belgians just missed him, but they missed him all the same. Sentenced in France three years ago to a lifetime of forced labor for the murder of the mayor of a village that evicted them. He escaped from the power station in Melun together with Jo Amila, also known as Jo the Boxer, sentenced to 20 years after an attempted bank robbery. His accomplice, Jacques Helman. Also sentenced to 20 years for the same case. Dear little Helman doesn't have a nickname. They've been on the run for two years now and their track record has earned us a summons to the Chamber of Deputies and no fewer than four arguments from the Minister himself. They're out there in the open like men who have nothing to lose. Look at those eyes. There's more than just hatred in them. There's contempt, a deep disgust that comes from his race. He said so at the trial. Those gypsies are destined for the dock before they're even born. And besides, society tolerates them only in a vacant lot or on the edge of a dump. They're practically animals with the plague. This lone wolf steals to feed his pack. His motivations reinforce his violence. Jacques, get the lights. It's up to you, Special Brigades, to arrest this man, who you can be sure doesn't sleep in the same bed twice. I know that gypsy hunting is in style right now. In order to evacuate their camps in Arcueil, Ivry and elsewhere, all police forces are being mobilized. They should concentrate on the banks and main rail stations. That's all up to me, of course. On that note, you're dismissed. For the time being, we have the five, the seven, the ten and the thirteen… A masterpiece. This one won't be easy to sell. Jealous? But jealous of what, honey? He's 35 years older than me. You're the only one that matters. Everything I take from him is for you. No, I won't know until he leaves. No, he doesn't suspect anything, but it's secret on principle. You're so silly! Still suffering from that pesky migraine? Stop it or I'll jump! Have you gone completely insane? Get back! If I jump, everyone will think that you pushed me. And you'll get life! Because my lover… He's a cop, if you really want to know. Get down. During the night, a jeweler was robbed. At dawn, Yan Kuq's wife fell from their penthouse window. If Yan weren't a notorious safebreaker, there would surely be no relation between the two cases. Questions? An ex-safebreaker? He's not getting any younger. You can't put an age on an expert. Find him. I want to know where he spent the night. With his wife. It's not like she can say otherwise. Check his schedule. Follow him. Let's get the brigade on the case. They're already mobilized against the Gypsy and his gang. And what have they achieved? Six attacks in two weeks. No, you deal with Yan. I'll keep trying to get the minister off our backs. Well, that sounds promising. Jacques, I'm counting on you. Don't you agree, Mr. Mareuil? Yes, of course. It's just… Are we going to start digging around in that woman's life? Crisis of conscience? Well, this isn't the place for that. Let me explain it again. One incident at a jeweler's, another at Yan's home. It's a possibility that the latter is connected to the former. I don't know why, there's just… It's like a trace of perfume. Go and take a whiff at Yan's club. That's just it, Chief. I can't go down there. -Why not? -Because… Well… -They know me down there. -So they'll see you again, that's all. Do you remember when you thought Yan was selling the Gypsy's junk through Jo Amila? I followed Yan for two weeks. And that's when… -That's when I… -When you what? Well, basically, I met his wife. I had no choice! She was always there at the cash register. -That's no reason to get upset. -Yeah… But she was so beautiful. And her body… I slept with her. You'd have done the same in my place. That's not very professional. I thought she'd turn him in sooner or later. She was sick of him. Basically, you were on duty. That's it, Chief. Especially since she called me right before she died. She called you? She was jealous. She'd call me at all hours of the night. It was four o'clock in the morning. I was alone. Alone? And then suddenly she hung up. Yes. Yan had just gotten home. Unfortunately, your testimony is useless. Why? Can you see yourself in court explaining how you were the lover of a gangster's wife? So what? It's a modern method. "So what, it's a modern method"? You'll still have journalists and lawyers saying that you're the one who killed her because the situation got too compromising. That's not true, I swear! Do you know what a cop's word is worth these days? All right. You can finish what you so diligently started. I don't want to hear any more talk of Yan. I want him right here. Roger? It's Blot. About the Gypsy… Couldn't we do a series of raids in the area? Yes, of course I know he's not there, but it could help turn them against him. You see? Conflict always pays off. This is the last straw. I'm hiding out in Trouville, in my pajamas, watching the regattas and what do we get? An army of cops! From all over France and beyond! At my house. This Gypsy is worse than the plague. No need to exaggerate. The cops won't be here long and there's no reason for them to come knocking. Jeannot, your obliviousness is astounding. I'm out of here. Is the villa in your brother's name? -Yes. -So what about your brother? He's got a criminal record that's sure to drag us down with him. The cops are going to search this town with a fine-tooth comb. This is the first place they'll think to look. They're going to turn your brother's house upside down. You're leaving? But your lawyer will be here in an hour. I'll see him later. I'm tired of telling him that I didn't kill my wife and hearing him tell me that everything will work out once I turn myself in. Maybe he's got something new. He can tell me in Palavas-les-Flots. You can't travel across France! I'm going sardine fishing at Gullible Pierrot's. You'll be stopped at the first police roadblock. At my age? Have you seen me? Put those photos down. They're blocking the view. There's a guy on that boat playing cup-and-ball. The one in front's for you. Take a look. Oh, boy… Fascinating! That's fabulous. I don't see what's so fabulous. Well, you're never interested in anyone. Suits or chicks. Sometimes I wonder why you even escaped. We dream of what we don't have. And when we have it… We'd be better off abroad. I'm already abroad. In prison, you told me how sometimes you feel like yelling. At whom? At what? You wouldn't understand. You can't change anything alone. It all depends on other people. You can't change other people, either. So sometimes when you're in pain, you want to yell. Can you imagine the din if everyone who needed to started yelling, all at once? We call that a revolution. I don't. A revolution is a war. I'm thinking of something else. Something else? You wouldn't be able… I'm going to take a walk. He's complicated, right? Sure. He doesn't even think about women. He's got nothing but vengeance in his balls. He thinks too much. Look at the Boxer. When he thinks, it's chaos! Now I understand why you didn't make a career out of it. Hey, Marcel! Double the good news. -Isn't the Gypsy around? -We'll tell him, don't worry. He'll do whatever we want. Exactly. Fine. First of all, I found Riquet the Parisian. Second of all, the Nice case is set for July 8. We'll start with Nice. No. We'll start with Riquet. -Where is the bastard? -In a little hotel in Palavas-les-Flots. A spot called Bob's. That's very interesting and all, but we'd prefer the Nice job. Money first. That's the last case, then Jacques and I will cross the border. We're going to Palavas. We're not your stooges. I know what you are. Hold on, now. Who put you in charge of business? You, unless you want to end up back in jail. It's not like your pals from Pigalle or wherever came looking for you! Without me and my brothers, you'd still be in there. So Palavas first! What do we do? Screw that. Leave it. Beat it, Jacques. BOB'S Is he alone? Yes. Riquet! Open up. It's me, Bob. What's going on? We were in prison together. Didn't he tell you? In your neck of the woods. I only accepted the position to be of service to you, right? You don't remember me, then. Let's go out. That should refresh your memory. The tourists are starting to arrive. Bob's is always a little crowded. I've heard the waitresses go upstairs with the patrons. Sometimes that's a big help. Remember when we always used to go to Ninie's? She ran her bar like a boss. We all had a crush on her. She was 20 years old. Life just passes you by. I'll have these scars forever. Here too! Well, it wasn't just me, was it? That's true. The guards held me down. That's what they're paid for. But you… You said something as you attacked me. Remind me what you said. You know, it was just… Go on. Say it. "Gypsy scum"? You know, we all say things that… "Woodlouse"? "Vermin"? "Race of whores." "Son of a bitch and a pig." Remember that one? Gypsy? You're not going to do that, are you? You have to admit that it's much better here than in prison. You wouldn't have been in prison long. Afterwards you would've had far more freedom. My basic principle is that one hour in jail is an hour too long. The police handed the entire file to the judge. I saw him. He's a young'un. I told him that you call me from time to time. That amused him. Of course, he reissued the warrant for your arrest and had the apartment and the club sealed. What a charming young man. All right, here's my version of events. I spent the night at home in the conjugal bed. I got up early. I wanted to walk the empty streets of Paris with the night-shift workers. It keeps me honest. And poetic! I'll give you that. My wife didn't believe me, obviously. A woman in love… She wanted to come with me. In love and an early bird. I refused and said I wouldn't discuss it further. Anyway… That's the scene set. Everyone knows the principle. It's like she went crazy, threatening to throw herself off the balcony. In any case, it's very simple. But that's not how a woman with a lover would behave. A lover? Is that in the file? No. Because this lover of hers is a criminal police inspector. -How do you know that? -Your barman. He heard some officers talking about it. It seems this guy's name is Mareuil. Right. I'd like this Mareuil to say it to my face. Of course, he'll never speak out officially. But unofficially, the police are using it to form an opinion. You can't convict someone on the basis of unofficial information. Think again. Come and tell the judge your final version. Never. Hey! There's an army of cops coming in from all over, even Paris. They're not here for you. Last night they found a corpse at the edge of a pond five kilometers away, riddled with bullets. It's the Gypsy and his cronies picking up a guy on the run hiding out at Bob's. I can't believe it. This Gypsy is always hot on my heels. -I'd better be going. -Sure. -Do you need anything in Paris? -No. Hey, if you're packing your suitcase again, wait a while. You're not leaving? Of course I am. The area's swarming with cops. But this will all blow over! And you'll be perfectly safe here. What do you say? You'll be fine. I'm sure that's just one of my buddies. Who is it? Police! Open the door! Go ahead. Pierre, also known as Gullible Pierrot. -Am I wrong? -Not at all. -Don't you recognize me? -Sure I do. You're unforgettable, Inspector! I'm Division Chief now. Congratulations. When I found out you lived just across the street, I thought that perhaps you'd seen something from your window. Just by chance, of course. Seen what? Dear Bob putting his friends in a car. All I'm interested in these days is fishing for sardines, Chief. Did you know Riquet the Parisian? -No. -Neither did Bob. It's funny. Now that he's dead, no one knows him. So you don't know anything about the guy driving the car, either? I spend most of my time at sea or in the harbor. Try to understand. Someone tipped the Gypsy off about Riquet being at Bob's. Wouldn't that person know where the Gypsy is? That's smart thinking, Chief. I won't drop this bone easily. I've got half a mind to send the tax inspectors after you. I'd love to know where you found the money for your boat and all the rest. So get that brain into gear. I'll be back to see you. By the way, I love grilled sardines. Sure, it's perfectly safe here. Goddamn cops! Can't that Gypsy go and be an asshole over the border? The gudgeon seems to be far less popular than the sardine this year. I'm going to try my luck on the banks of the Marne. Ninie has an inn near Champigny. Police! Identity check! Police! Identity check! Police! Identity check! But Chief, you know who we are! Come on, now. -These are orders from Paris. -We're looking for the Gypsy. That's no reason to stop me from working! You can look all you want, you won't find anything. We'll sure remember this club! It's a disgrace! All I want is news of the Gypsy. I am not an intelligence agency. Well, I advise that you become one. The problem with your bike is that you can't wear a suit. To get up north, we've got new license plates. We've got papers. Italian diplomatic corps. It'll be a Lancia. They can take them. I prefer my bike. More freedom. It's not all good news. The cops are stepping up on raids to find you. It's getting in the way of business. People aren't happy. Damn it. They've got all the bars, the hotels, trying to get people to rat you out. Yes, they're not being subtle. Are you sure? You know the Rinaldi brothers? -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. In exchange, I want my girl to be able to come pick up some of your customers. All right. We'll be waiting. Bye. All we have to do is wait ten or 15 minutes and call a buddy of mine who has a little bar just across from the hotel. 24 Rue Léon. It's a small hotel. You'll find the Gypsy in the arms of a woman named Madeleine. Who are you? Everyone downstairs! Hello? Roger? Yes? Hi, Marcel. Could you take a look at the hotel across the street? What's going on there? Nothing's going on. Should something be going on? Oh, right. Good God, it's the cops. They're at the hotel. Hey, Marcel. What are they going to find? No one. Thanks, Roger. We definitely need to get abroad. So what's the plan for tomorrow? Hi, Georges! How's it going? Very well. The bags. Don't be an idiot. Francis forgot his hat. Go! Thanks, Doc. He's dead. Bye. See you tomorrow! We're closing, sir. I want to speak with the owners, the Rinaldi brothers. -And who are you? -A friend. Yes, sir. There's someone at the bar to see you. They'll be right down, sir. For me? You wanted to see us? Not me. Him. I heard you're not comfortable with us being armed. It saves us a lot of trouble. That's fair. What can we get you? A glass of water. Oh, I almost forgot… That little bar on Rue Léon… Does a hooker named Madeleine ring any bells? What about Marcel? First of all, we don't need to answer to you. You're not one of us. You're a loner. -You're just a pain in the ass. -Am I, now? The cops are making our lives hell. That's no reason to help them. Every gypsy has the cops on his back. But you won't find a gypsy helping the cops. When you're in business, you can't just pack your bags. We're not nomads. That's true. But I thought there were certain rules around here. In the underworld, perhaps. Here it smells like a garbage dump. Trust me, I'd know. It only stinks because you're here. I'd recommend that you never come back. We didn't have a choice with the cops. Besides, we knew that you'd escape again. You're a big shot, a kingpin. Always one step ahead. -We know you. -No, you don't. If you ever have a choice, make a better one. All right! Saddle up! Here we go. How's it going up there? Not good. They're hunting us. Get further up north. It's all the same. They chased the others away with clubs. We don't know where to go. We're like dogs. No, less than dogs. Their dogs have hospitals and groomers and parks and shows. You go to jail if you hurt a dog. Those people will cry for a baby seal, but not when our women give birth on trash. What do they want? For us to forget our race, our blood, our customs. They want us to disappear. I'd rather die. The worst thing is that there aren't enough of us to revolt. We have to save the kids and send them to school. Mine won't go anymore. They throw stones at them. Give this to Father. When do you leave? Tonight. BOTH RINALDI BROTHERS SHOT AND KILLED BY THE GYPSY, JACQUES HELMAN AND JO AMILA. HELMAN WOUNDED IN RIGHT ARM. Maybe this will help get the informants going. If Helman's wounded, that's a plus. Those people heal fast. Mareuil! Hello. News of Yan, Chief. Françoise found a brooch from the Boucheron robbery. -Are you sure? -Boucheron recognized him. -And the trace? -We're following the guy who sold it. He works in a gambling club. Well done. Hey, sir! I saw a huge bubble just then! And soon maybe you'll see a huge fish. Are you on vacation? No. I'm retired. Were you at the station? Working on the railroad? Can you keep watch for me? I'm going to play a game of boules. What if there's a fish, sir? Keep him talking until I get back. NINIE'S Why don't you ask me for my goddamn house while you're at it? I couldn't care less for your cooking! You and your clients can get the hell out of here! Blackmailing Ninie? What's wrong with you? I've beaten off guys more foolish than you with clubs! You can stick your food up your ass! What is the world coming to? Get out of here! You messed with the wrong woman! Got that into your thick skull? Do you hear me? Either you shut it, or I'll throw you out the window! Off you go. Get out! -I've been betrayed. -Again? I bet the tough guy you were boasting about wasn't much help? Well, you're wrong. You've got a one-track mind! It's the staff. Listen to me and you'll understand. I'll have the rillettes today. You're not interested in anything. That gave me a fright. What happened? There are Italian diplomats in the neighborhood? What do you think? There's everyone in the neighborhood. The Italian embassy is renting the house next door for them. If this carries on, we'll all be wearing tuxedos to dinner. I almost ran over him, didn't I? Hey, Jo… She's got a near-perfect ass. You're sick in the head. I'd make her my nurse. There was a man here. He left, but there's a fish. -Do you think you'll catch it? -I don't think so, sir. He took the bait and got away. -He's a smart fish. -He sure is. I've never seen you before. Do you live around here? Yes, just behind the big white house. -Why aren't you in school? -I don't really fit in. By walking around, you can learn a lot if you look carefully. Without a teacher? Sure. And another thing… When does a flower wake up, when does it fall asleep… The length of a spider's thread. You can make a boat out of a piece of chestnut bark, a flute with a reed, and a little lamp with some orange peel. -And a battery? -No, oil. -Are you a lamp salesman? -No, I'm not. Who are you, then? I'm just like you. I don't really fit in. That's why I'm out here. Easy, Doc! Break the plaster, not the skin! You can start physiotherapy now. Slow, gentle movements, wiggling your fingers. I brought you a good client this time. Worth more than an abortion. Well, abortions these days… They practically sell them in megastores these days. It's the death of the craftsman. -You haven't aged at all. -Thank you. You cheat like a 20-year-old. I can see the card underneath! Hello, lovebirds! Here's your share. Check it if you like. How's it going? Here are those issues of Hôtellerie Française you asked for. Put this somewhere safe. I trust you. I've never heard anyone say that to a woman. This is all about the money. Ask him who he can trust his share with. Not a woman, unfortunately. Well, Jeannot, you had your chance. No, those 30 years of partying were worth it. What did the attorney say? He'll be here any minute. He took all the precautions, I hope? Yes, I picked him up on the train and took him to his car. Simple yet effective. He went into the first inn on the right. Maybe there are girls in there. Or he's waiting for one. All right, turn back around. What if Yan's hiding out there? Good God, I think we've got him. I need this. Your judge has fixed ideas, like all judges, in fact. But what will you risk by going to see him? They'll give us a month's preventive, a freebie. Who exactly is this "us"? You won't be the one sitting inside. He didn't marry the wrong girl. Don't worry, I'll do an excellent job. Remember the Luxembourg case? I talked, and you walked. Just like a magic trick. A magic trick that cost me 50,000 dollars. No one's buying that crap anymore. -Hello. -Hello. We'll like a room, please. For a few days? Two or three days, that depends. Let me have a look. -With a bathroom, if possible. -They all have bathrooms. Number seven, garden view. Do you have any luggage? No. It was a last-minute trip. I see. -Will you be eating here tonight? -Oh, yes. Hey. You're cured! It doesn't matter. I'm leaving tomorrow. Jacques and I are sticking together. We're leaving tomorrow too. As you wish. We might never see each other again. That's worth drinking to, isn't it? There's a little inn next door. No. Go without me. We'll have a feast! I'm sick of eating cassoulet from a can. I'm not hungry. I spotted a cute barmaid. Maybe she takes clients upstairs. Hey! Not even for the barmaid? Really? Really. Good evening. Two martinis, please. I'll fetch your book from the car. Do you have a light? Yes, of course. Thanks. Jacques will never try to see us again. When he was a boy, he was ashamed of us because we were janitors. He only hung around with the rich kids. Mr. Helman… Chief! We found Yan Kuq. That's no reason not to knock before entering. Is he with the Gypsy's gang? Maybe it is a good enough reason. They're opening the gate. I can see Jacques Helman. Behind the wheel of a Lancia, I recognize Jo the Boxer. I can't see the Gypsy. Jacques Helman is closing the interior gate. Jacques Helman's leaving through the side door. I still don't see the Gypsy. The Lancia's up and running, turning onto the next street on the right. This is Blot. Put all officers stationed in the south on high alert. Get the Lancia far enough away from here so that we can't hear the explosions. Over and out. Let's go, guys. Surround the house. He wants to be alone to go where? Back home, to the gypsies. They're all he things about. There were times when I wanted to kill him. And others when he was like a brother to me. But his mind was always somewhere else. He looked at you, but never saw you. We'll miss him, you know. He doesn't have a twisted mind like everybody else. Maybe we'll see him again someday. We'll go into Switzerland through the mountains. Then we'll find some scheme to get us to Asia or Turkey. A submissive wife… Besides, with your English, we'll have no issues. Shit, it's the cops! Get out of here. Run! Oh, boy… Fabulous… Gypsy. We didn't make it… Are you ill? Wounded? Do you speak Spanish? No… There's an army of cops outside! I know, I saw them. But they're not here for you. There's some public enemy out there, a murderer, a gang. Don't be so dramatic. But still, they're here. Where can I hide? This way. Come on. Well, if it isn't our friend Yan Kuq. Search the inn. I'm sure you'll find plenty. Want to join your dear friend the Gypsy? I'm assuming your humor is unintentional. That's right. Go ahead and tell me you don't know him. We're going in for the attack. You'll have a front row seat. Personally, I have nothing to be ashamed of. This is Captain Mallet. Do you read me? Hugo Sennart! You are surrounded! You don't stand a chance! All your accomplices have been arrested. Don't force us to shoot you down. Give yourself up! The Gypsy got away? Serves you right. It's easier to arrest innocent people! Bunch of assholes! "Shut up." Is that all you know how to say? Honestly, you're forgetting that my taxes pay your wages! Maybe I shouldn't yell at my staff, but the thing is, my staff adores me. The same can't be said for you. You have interesting clients at your inn. We have whoever we can, buddy. I'm not denying where I came from or who my friends are. Yan's like a brother. He's known me since I was a kid. Of course the innkeeper didn't know that you were a wanted man. Exactly. She knew nothing. Chief, why am I being kept here? Get your hands off me! All right, I won't protest, I won't move. You'll have to carry me. Pick her up. She can go home. I'll take care of the lawyer. The judge will decide later. You're free to go. To sum up, what happened to your wife isn't of much interest to us. I'm sure that you'll get the case dismissed. You see, all my cards are on the table. I'm aware. So you were hiding a stone's throw from the Gypsy and his gang without realizing? I spend my time avoiding him like the plague. It was a coincidence. Well, when it comes to the Gypsy, we use the word "chance." Better, right? Admit it, I'm a true gentleman. -Will that be all? -No. No. Your wife's fall occurred at five o'clock in the morning, and, the same night, the Boucheron jeweler was robbed. There's another coincidence that I just can't seem to shake. It just won't go down, like a fishbone. Eating breadcrumbs should sort you out. DOCTOR J.WEISS - VETERINARIAN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY Hello. Can I help you? I need medical attention. Help me. Where did you spend the night of March 9? In bed with my wife. She's no longer here. How convenient. A domestic scene at five in the morning. Strange, no? I was preparing to leave. -At dawn? To go where? -Lyon. I wanted to visit a hotel that I intended to buy. Which hotel? Finally, a new question. The Tivoli, on Rue du Rhône. It was being auctioned off. Was there anyone at the hotel who you'd spoken to, or whom you'd mentioned it to beforehand? No, I read about it in a corporate magazine. Hôtellerie Française. You can check the date. In the meantime, I'm going to keep you here. It'll give you some time to reflect. Police custody is 48 hours. I know. Thanks. Don't forget the breadcrumbs. For the fishbone. I'm sorry about the lack of anesthetic, but the second bullet was in there pretty deep. You're a strong one! There are auctions held every day. Maybe it's something he saw afterwards. That's fair, Mareuil. We're going to tell you the truth. So you get home late, say around five o'clock in the morning. Your wife is on the telephone. Very interesting. -With whom? -Her lover. A conversation that gets your blood boiling, you see red… Your wife gets scared and backs out onto the terrace. And then we'll use your version. What I'm interested in is what you were doing beforehand. So my wife had a lover. You must know who it is, if you're so sure. Let me think… Could it be a cop? A young guy, preferably. Perhaps a guy like you. Gentlemen, your story goes a long way. So you were sleeping with the wife of a criminal? She was no doubt paying you off, too, wasn't she? A nice, tailored suit, a fancier car than you could otherwise afford… What a wonderful story for the judges and the journalists. We never said your wife's lover was a cop. When you talk about someone, it means you know him! Otherwise, you'd shut up! If you're going to take the rough road, either keep your wits about you until the end or don't leave the highway. Yan… Tell us where you spent the night. With my wife. By the way, does your jeweler have a night watchman? I want to speak to him. No use. They didn't see anyone. They were clubbed in the head from behind, as you know. Do I? You're not going to get me with an "as you know." In your game, you don't have the upper hand. You'll have to hand everything over to the investigating judge. I've been here for two weeks. You're breaking the law. Wrong. Here's the custody book. It only counts from the day a suspect's name is written in it. How funny… I can't seem to find yours anywhere. Watching you work makes me want to join those throwing Molotov cocktails at you. Hello? Hello, ma'am. Yes, it's me. Yes. Yes. What breed? All right. Come by tomorrow morning, around 10:30. But of course. Goodbye, ma'am. All right, well… Goodbye, then. Thank you. I think you're forgetting something. Damn it! You must know who I am. I'm sure of it! So why did you help me? Because I'm just like them? No. You see, my good man, I lived in the colonies for a long time. There were different customs, the right of asylum. Over there, a house is sacred. It should be left just as it was found. So I was lucky? Not as lucky as them. Because men will find you and kill you. I don't expect to live very long. Here. Help yourself. It's my pleasure. We didn't steal from anyone, only the State. No, I couldn't. I'd prefer that you shake my hand. Here's what you entrusted to me. You can keep it for now. I don't need it anymore. It's only me. I don't have any children or grandchildren. A boat without sails or a rudder isn't really a boat anymore. But it's still a boat. You can fix a boat. You can't fix a man. Is that what you're getting at? You're a good girl, Ninie. But what did you get out of being a good girl? I get to watch the Marne flow. I have a friend who sometimes comes by to talk about the good old days. When we were wolves with long, sharp teeth… When we went on the run… Without ever daring to speak of love. The fear of going soft… Like the idiots we were. THE GYPSY SUSPECTED DEAD DUE TO WOUNDS YAN KUQ FREED I have to leave. You're safe here. We've got lookouts all around the camp. They can't surprise us. I have a debt. I must repay it. I'll be back. Yan Kuq? Why are you here? I heard that you were released. At first, I couldn't bear to read the papers. I didn't even know that you were arrested in my place, in Champigny. I'm sorry. You shouldn't be. The cops came looking for me first. They only spotted you afterwards. I don't want to bother you much longer, but… I wondered if you knew anything of Jacques Helman. I thought you might be able to tell me where he is. He's still in the hospital in Fresnes. Jo Amila is dead. You must know that. All right, well… Thanks. We can't stay here. Come in. Come on. You can dry off in the bathroom. Help yourself to a bathrobe. There's food in the refrigerator. Come! It feels strange being here. It's strange having you here. Looking at you, I think I remember something. Did you sail down the Seine on a boat? On a little yacht? Yes. Why? I think I saw you playing cup-in-ball. We had a hideout on the river. Our only distraction was watching people through the binoculars. An odd coincidence, don't you think? That's not the only one. -What do you mean? -Nothing. What will you do now? I'm going to try to get Jacques out of his hole. Otherwise they'll cut his head off. Don't push your luck, Gypsy. How about a cup of coffee? Sure. You have it all. No one has it all. Fortunately. Where are you sleeping? I'll work something out. You can sleep here, if you like. Thank you. Would you like a book? Yes. I like the ones with pictures best. Or photos. Yan… I'm leaving at dawn. Stories like ours often end at dawn. Here's the job. You see, I never stop. Say the names again. Jeannot Rasner, Clément Duroch… And Yan Kuq. Your names have been called. There's just one missing. Chief, the sun's rising. I can't wait to get him. So you're an early riser too. It's time. Thank you for everything. The pleasure was all mine. Four with me. Lucien and Georges will stay here. -Damn it! -What? We forgot the croissants. Not laughing, Mareuil? Damn it… Stand over there. What do we do, Chief? Shout "police"? No, say it's the janitor. In any case, don't shoot, Mareuil. -Shall we? -Wait! Go for it… Don't move a muscle. Hands on heads. Move over. Yan! Yan! It's me! Get out of here! You don't stand a chance. The whole area's sealed off. Don't worry. Take the elevator. I'll follow you. I don't have the same reasons as you. It's true, we've never traveled together. Give me the keys to your car. You, go with him! Come on! Hostages make life a lot easier, don't they? Get back, Inspector. "Inspector"? Didn't you hear me? Get back! You won't… I'm not a murderer. Go on, open the door. Go find your boss. You need all the men you've got just to take down one. The Gypsy! Don't shoot. He's got the Chief! Chief? Is that you? It appears so, yes. So can we go? Yes, we can go. -What about the Chief? -It's fine. We got him back. I've been waiting for this a long time. I don't doubt it. Mind if I take a look? I know you know your way around. Search it from top to bottom. The Gypsy leaves your apartment, but you don't know him? He ended up here by chance. You gave him your car keys. By force. And it was by chance that you spent a night at Boucheron? You know, young man, nothing really matters to me anymore. You know, I saw you. They're taking us to live in big houses. We won't be able to live outside anymore. You have to stop them! Don't you worry. I'll stop them one day. I want to stay with you. Another time. You'll go to school, and after that, you'll be free. Go on. I'll be right there. Subtitle translation by: Rebecca Schofield
