You wanna bet? Come on, let's make a bet. - But what's the stake? - As much as you like. - 5, 10, 100... Whatever. Come on. - Fuck off. You only live once. Exactly, only once. So you can't live life like an asshole. So you're saying in order to not live life like an asshole, you gotta risk it? If you want to get out of the muck, you have to pay a price. And I want out! Then get out of it, but do it when I'm not there. Come on, poopy-pants, you're lucky I got a grip on this ride. - You know, Tagliaferri can kiss my ass. - Yes. So you want to butt heads with Tagliaferri? He's a legend. If I had more cylinder capacity, I'd become a legend too. - Along with the whole car. - Legends live in garages these days? Wisecracker. Give me one year, and everybody in Rome... - ...will only talk about me. You'll see! - One year... And you think you're still alive in a year as crazy as you are? You think this thing's a donkey? - They’re wild beasts with 120 HP. - Wild beasts? You have no clue. Have you ever seen a naked one? Have you ever stripped her part for part? No? - So what are you talking about? - I'm not saying anything. When you feel her vibrating below you, it's not a car anymore, it's music. When the pistons are dancing: Music. The whistling of the wind: Music. - The bursting of a tire... - Music! - A funeral march... - Still music. - You really are crazy. - You gotta be crazy, my friend. Leave my face alone! My friend, life's like a soup... ...that has to be cooked with a pinch of craziness. - You know who said that? - Nobody said that. Then I say it. Green car with the Roman license plate A 56943... ...that didn't stop at a police road block in Via Flaminia is now driving along the Tiber. That’s something for us. - Shark 6 and Double-sail 21. - Yes, Shark 6? - Are we in too? - We're the only ones there, moron. Look, he's right in front of us. Then we can call it off. A squad car's already in pursuit. I don't see anybody. Yep, total this one too. Then you can ride a bike next time. - Why do you want to overtake the squad car? - To see who's faster. - You got soda in your engine? - What do you care? Holy Mary! You'll get me killed. Goddamn it. - Look at this. - What is it? Shark 6 outpaces the squad car. Tagliaferri. Come here and check this out. One of your guys plays the asshole. Always him, huh? Radio him. Shark 6. Respond, Shark 6. He switched off the radio. You're shitting your pants right now, right? No, I've already shat my pants. - Now there's only one left. - And the patrol car? - Shook him off. - Then we'll lose them too. Come on, let him see your taillight. Watch out! Brakes! They parked around a tree. You were really lucky. When you go to the park next time, go by foot. - Asshole. - Likewise. One moment. Even playing crazy needs to be learned. If I had a 2,000 instead of a 1,600, this wouldn't have happened. No, it's not a question of cylinder but brain capacity. - Okay, my mistake. Let's go, boys. - I'm not done yet. I feel terrible! I don't like your driving style one bit. You don't hit the brake in a curve on high speed. - But he braked too! - No, Palma, they didn't brake. They accelerated. That’s a trick even little kids know. You just need to connect the stop lights with a switch, and there you go. And now and again a great race driver like yourself falls for it. - Then you go fly. - I didn't know that. You don't know a lot of things. That’s not a problem. There aren't just race drivers in police force. I went to the police to drive, and that's what I'm gonna do! What you do is up to me. Get that in your head if you got one. - You may go now. - Come on. There are also other opportunities at the police. Remember that. Holy words... I'm in real rough shape thanks to you. Asshole. I hope you'll be staying longer in Rome, Mr. Dossena. Rome is always Rome, Mr. Sergio. Once you're here, you don't ever want to leave. Yes, but you're from Nice. The French Riviera is always the French Riviera, isn't it? - Oui, oui. - All done, Mr. Dossena. I hope you're satisfied this time as well. - Merci. - Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. You're next, sir. The mileage is important these days, and this one manages easily 10 miles per liter. Sure, that's what they say. In reality it'll make 7 or 8 max. - Sure, if you drive races. - Me, races? Do I look like someone who drives races? No, not you, just in general, if you want to go crazy from time to time. Go crazy? Miss, do you think I... - Not you, but the one who drives the car. - I will drive it. Francesca! Marco. Just a minute, please. So this is how you spend your convalescence? Listen. Save me the sermon, please. It's not the right moment. - With you it's never the right moment. - Exactly. You got it. - Miss. - One moment. - What does he want? - I'm working. He's a customer. - Fine, but now I'm here. Or am I interrupting? - No, but you better wait outside. - I'll finish here soon. - Take your time. I'm going. No, wait! - So you just came to fight? - There’s nothing else I can do with you. Well, you can leave your bad mood at home. No, I want to have it with me. I don't have to answer to anyone, not even you. Ah, I see. So why are we still together? That’s exactly what I think. We better split. Ciao, Bella. Marco, listen. Just think about it. - I'm sick of being the victim all the time. - You, the victim? And I'm the crazy one here, huh? Have a nice day, Missy. No, no, no, you must be completely crazy! If you have to repair it anyway, what would a few changes cost you? You really don't want to understand? You're asking me to manipulate state property. Then tell the state, if I do have to risk my life, at least I want to do it my way. I have to tell them that? Go tell it yourself. Listen, maybe I've found a solution. I got an idea. Let me use the workshop... - ...I'll take care of the rest, all right? - Okay, we're only a few here... ...but in the end, we'll get busted anyway. I'll come here when everybody's gone. I'll do it at night. Who would find out? Give me this chance, Maresciallo. They’re driving around in their souped-up beasts. I'm not saying I want to draw level with them, but I don't want to lose from the start either. You understand me. You're not one of those guys who went to the force... ...just to collect their paycheck at the end of the month. - Why then? - Well, to give meaning to your life. To feel like... - You got it, right? - No. - How can I explain? - Listen. You better don't say anything anymore. Come here and do whatever you like. - Then you'll stop bugging me. - Thanks, Maresciallo, thank you. - You're a real friend. - A friend, my ass. If your boss finds out, don't count on me. I don't exist and won't lift a finger for this engine. Remember that! - Tonight, 30 busted out. - 30! Mamma Mia... - No, your mama wasn't one of them. - Wisecracker. 29, to be precise. Number 30 was the warden. When he heard about it, he hauled ass. Let's not joke around. In two days I'll get my promotion, and I don't want it revoked. - Might happen. - Bite me. Basilicata, don't you realize they're busting your balls? They’re all jealous. They don't like me defecting to the ministry... ...while they're working on the front line. Yes, they're special people... ...young people, people who... What? Who's my partner? - There it is: Palma, right? - But he's still in convalescence! No, he's recovered. The car's fixed too. By the way, did the shop return it already? - Yeah, yeah. - I went through hell... Another day in hell... Why am I always assigned to this crazy ass Palma? I got a terrible headache. - So I'm crazy, huh? - Who said that? So you're not scared to ride with me? No, I'm not scared, I'm shitting my pants. Come along. With you it's always high-speed. Not just by car, but also on foot. Why don't you take some Valerian in the morning? It's like you got pepper up your butt. Easy, easy, easy. Why did you soup-up the car? This one? It even seems weaker to me. Get out. Are you trying to shit me, huh? I noticed right away that it's souped-up. Right when you started the engine. - Yes, it's true, it's souped-up. - Who gave you the permission? - Come on, who authorized it? - Nobody. And why did you give yourself the permission? Do you think you can do whatever you feel like? This ain't no cathouse. I don't need trouble with anybody! - And before you ruin me... - I don't want to ruin anybody. - Then why did you soup-up that car? - You know that better than me. - You shouldn't be surprised. - Speak clearly. What are you trying to say? - You used to do the same thing! - What do you mean? That you're entitled to do everything I did? - Why am I not allowed to? - No, you're not allowed to! You're afraid I'm better than you! That’s it! What did you say? Because you want to stay the only great driver in the police force! - That’s why you don't get off my case. - Listen, you son of a bitch. I'm not beating the shit out of you only because I'm your superior... - ...and we're at the police headquarters. - We can go out if you like. All right, wait for the next occasion and I might actually do it. You'll find your disciplinary sanctions when you get back here. I'll be damned... Come on. - Are we ready, Pistone? - Everything's ready. Let's go. It's crazy. He's capable of sending me back on patrol. What do you think? That he's right. Did you know that he was even more gung-ho in his day than I am? I got all the newspapers from back then. Got them all up here. Where do you have them? - All up here. - Ah, okay. In July 1960 a squad car stopped a Maserati at the Piazza di Spagna... ...that had been stolen the night before. In front of Termini Station, another squad car was waiting... ...with the now famous Tagliaferri behind the wheel. After he had overtaken the first squad car - Hey! He overtook another squad car! Got it? Yeah I got it. He overtook the other squad car... But there's more. October 1961. The fast car of a criminal was pursued... ...and forced against a wall by a high-powered squad car. A 2,000, presumably souped-up. So? It's just the way I told you, right? He did the exact same things. But Palma may not. And why not? - Why? - I have no idea... Because he understood that Palma is better than him. - So he keeps him on a short leash. - That’s not the reason. He's angry because you destroy all his cars. - What are you staring at? - You think this is a car? It's even souped-up. Oh, yeah? You know what? That’s not good enough for me! He, however... January 1962. - The fearless driver... - The fearless driver... - ...of the mobile task force... - ...of the mobile task force... - ...was due to special achievements... - ...was due to special achievements... - ...promoted to vice-brigadiere! - ...promoted to vice-brigadiere! And he got a Ferrari. - Yes. - Yes. Finally a car that's worthy of Tagliaferri. And a car that's worthy of Palma, when will I get that? When will I get that? When I leave. Then they'll give you a nice car, that big. Thanks. At exactly 12:30 p.m. What did you say? Banca di Roma in Via Bossi? - Robbery of the Banca di Roma in Via Bossi. - Attention, calling all cars in San Paolo. Nothing yet? Looks like someone wrote down the license plate. Now turn right. Always straight ahead. Exactly. Then the second left. - Car No. 4? - Yes, Double-sail. - Where are you, No. 4? - In Ostiense. Then drive to Via Bartolomeo Bossi, in the San Paolo region. - Via Bartolomeo Bossi 73, 73. - Via Bartolomeo Bossi 73. - Exactly, there's a bank robbery. - Okay, roger that. - No Information about the car? - Maybe. Dictate it slowly. Now. Attention, attention. Calling all cars in the San Paolo region. We are looking for a brown Citroën, license plate Palermo 479111. The cars should circle that zone. All cars, give me your positions. AP Latino. All right, Shark 6, did you write down the license plate? - Yes. License plate Palermo 479111. - Right, confirmed. Please go here. Okay. Come on. Aren't we going to the assigned location? And what the hell should we do there? I want to get that car. - Where was the robbery? - There. But we're going that way. - Today it's the San Paolo guys' turn. - Fortunately. I'm really tired. You think I'm not? Tell me about it... Hey! That’s the car from the robbery. - It's impossible that they're here already. - The plate's correct. I'll call headquarters. - Did you say Flaminia? - What happened? Car 32 spotted the Citroën on Via Flaminia. Call the others back. Patrol car 3, patrol car 3, go to Flaminia. Roger that. Patrol car 12, you drive to Flaminia as well. Affirmative, we're on the way. - That’s impossible - License plate Palermo 479111. Where are they going? Are they crazy? Easy, patrol car 1, easy. Press the button and talk slowly. - I said, it's a total chaos here. - Calling all cars, watch out. Wait a minute. Let's try to figure this out. There’s not much to understand. There are two Citroëns. - Identical ones? - Identical. Look, I got both of them here. And our cars are here. Look. - Let's split them into groups. - All right. Attention. There are two cars from the robbery. They are identical. Patrol cars 4 and 12, drive towards the Olympic Village. Attention. Sara 20 and patrol cars 10 and 32... ...go towards Aventin and the surrounding areas. Attention. As soon as one of you spots the Citroën... ...give me your position. We will then send you two more cars for backup. Did you hear? We're driving in the wrong area. One of them has to go through here. Look, there it is! What did I tell you? We spotted one of them. God. Be careful, they're armed. We got a Shark behind us. Good, then we'll make him dance a little. And then we're gone. Double-sail, we've spotted the second car. Very good, 4, I'll send you No. 12. Hello, Double-sail, we're in pursuit now too. God, pursue them, 12, they're trying to leave town via the EUR quarter. - Yes. Yes, all right. - We got them on the hook. All right. If the one I'm thinking of is behind this mess... ...then we got nobody on the hook. Positions have already been transmitted. Archive, Todano. Yes. Bring me the file "Dossena, Jean-Paul". Yes, "Il Nizzardo". I want to check the latest entries. No, right away. Don't...! Holy Mary! Shark 6, where are you? Where are you? I don't know where I am, but I feel sick! - Patrol car 12, where are you? - At No. 4. We're very close. 12, respond. This is Double-sail 21. 12, respond. Double-sail, send an ambulance. A colleague is hurt. That’s it. The pursuit is off. Attention, this concerns all cars: The pursuit is called off. He says we have to stop the pursuit! I won't stop anything! Tell him that! I have to tell him that? Am I the one playing the hero here? Is he still behind us? - Yeah, this son of a bitch is tenacious. - Now we'll shake him. Come on, forget about it. You won't get them anymore. You sure about that? Forget about it. Listen, I'll tell Double-sail 21. Then you'll be in trouble. If you don't stop it, you'll be in trouble. Now watch me screw them over. No! I want to die in my bed! - Here we got them again, see? - And also the trouble. It might be him. - He was recently spotted in Rome. - He didn't pull anything in the last five years. You know, when you least expect it... Maresciallo. Shark 6 doesn't want to stop the pursuit. - Who is it? Palma? - Yes, but only him. Everybody else gave up. Palma, this is Tagliaferri. - Take it. He wants to talk to you. - Stop bugging me. Maresciallo, he doesn't even want to talk, and I'm dying of fear. We think the robbery was organized by Il Nizzardo. He's an extremely good driver. One who's really got it. Maybe that's the one you're dealing with. Let it go, Palma. You don't know him. Tell him, I'll stay on his tail to get to know him! Tell him! I want to get him! He says, he's pursuing him because he wants to get to know him. - That, I won't forgive him. - You're scared, huh? - Sure I'm scared. - I bet you want to get out. - Yes, please, let me get out. - No. - What does it cost you? - Shut up! - You're good. You'll catch them on your own. - Now shut it! CUL-DE-SAC He wouldn't have made it. Why did you shoot? I lured him here on purpose. Very nice, boys, " Les jeux sont faits". Or, as you say in Rome: " We got them shitfaced." And we're getting shitfaced too, right? Come on, get the drinks. Stop. No whiskey. Whenever Il Nizzardo defeated the driver of a squad car... ...he used to drink a bottle of champagne to celebrate. Two if it was that son of a bitch Tagliaferri. All right, then we'll drink champagne and think of that asshole Tagliaferri. I only called him a son of a bitch. But they really are all assholes, aren't they? No, not Tagliaferri. Tagliaferri is a man. He just stands on the other side. Yeah, agreed, but we don't give a damn about it. Let's drink. - All right, boys. - Come one. - Let's drink to our success. - Careful, don't spill it. Cover him up. I told you to let it go. - But it was... - I ordered you to stop. Now you will stop for a very long time. And don't forget to hand in your report. In detail! Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Father Longhi? Down in the workshop, behind the garden. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, young man. - Yes? - Aren't you Palma? Yes, Father. I knew it. - Marco! - Father Longhi. - How are you, my son? - Good. And you? Back again? For a year now. They send us all over, you know. - 13 years have passed. - You were a fledgling. A little crazy but nice. Let's go! This used to be your workbench. Do you remember? Yes. - What's wrong, Marco? - Nothing. Are you trying to kid someone who's wearing a soutane? - No, really, it's nothing. - I understand, you don't want to talk. Don't be mad at me, but us priests have the habit... ...to stick our noses in other people's business. I didn't mean it like that. Right, right, certain things you need to conquer on your own. The robbery took place in this area. So the second car has to show up here. Or here. Too simple. This time the second car will show up in the same area as the first one. - What? Together? - Parallelly. When the first car goes this way, the other one will flank it here... ...with a distance of two or three blocks. You get it? Two identical cars in the same area... ...create the impression that it's only one. Once spotted, they will play our cars back and forth like ping-pong-balls. But that's absurd. It is absurd... - A real pleasure, right, boss? - You have fun, don't you? Absolutely. It's a whole other thing. I worked with Pigeccia, Mannino and Sepitelli, but with you it's completely different. - Why is it different? - You got more imagination. It's not just a robbery and done. It's fun. It's a game, you know? And it has international flair. - The European Community. - Exactly. - Here we go, boss! - Hold on! Attention, calling all cars not currently in pursuit. Patrol the area, but don't drive away. The second Citroën could show up anywhere. How many are behind us? - Three, boss. - Good. We'll soon see Pistone, and then we'll split up. Affirmative. We'll send an ambulance. They’re both there. - Tagliaferri, you were right. - I know. - What should we do now? - Yeah, what should we do? What do you want to do? They’re gone now. At the moment we don't have a lot of facts. That doesn't rule out, however... ...that we will have a usable lead within the next hours. But how do you plan to prevent another incident in the meantime? It's more about the investigations... ...we're currently conducting in the usual milieus. Which means they can't be caught in the act. I didn't say that's impossible. It's very hard to accomplish that without endangering civilians. They say the bank robbery... ...carries the signature of Jean-Paul Dossena, alias "Il Nizzardo". Unfortunately, "they say" will do for the press, but it's not good enough for us. And neither for the judge. I'll leave the police force. I'll drop everything... - ...just the way they dropped me. - Is this about your boss again? Yes, it's always about him. Sooner or later he'll make me drive a squad car again, even in uniform. That’s why I want to drop everything. - What are you gonna do? - No idea. I'll think of something. Also become a thief. Ah, I was already afraid you might have changed... ...but thank God you're just as crazy as you used to be. Maresciallo, you have to believe me. I don't know anything. You always say the same thing. You want to jack up the price? I'd rather drop dead! I honestly don't know anything. Il Nizzardo is a tough cookie. - He can't be found so easily. - Beppo... Beppo... What should I do with you? - Yes, please? - Maresciallo Tagliaferri. Name? Jean-Paul Dossena. Just write "Il Nizzardo". You may go now. But as soon as you know something, tell me. As always, Maresciallo. This time it just didn't work out. Il Nizzardo is worse than Mandrake. - Sometimes here, sometimes there... - He's here, Maresciallo. - Who? - Il Nizzardo. - Holy Mary! - Get out. Hurry. He mustn't see you. Please. Mon dieu, you haven't changed at all. You too, Dossena, haven't changed, as I can see. May I? Tell me, do you remember that one time... ...you ended up in a shop window thanks to me? Where was that again? Oh, right, in Via Nazionale, wasn't it? Oh, yes, and that one time when you crashed into the Tiber because of me. Did you forget that? Oh, those were the days. Do you also have the impression that people were more courageous back then? - No idea. - Mais oui. People like you and me aren't born anymore. - If they'd be like you, it's better that way. - Mais pourquoi? I've put the past behind me. For good. Dossena, people like us never really stop. - I know you drive better than you used to. - No, I've always been a good driver. Not always, huh? I caught you more often than you got away. - That’s the bottom line. - Oui, but that's not important anymore. I - how do you say? - put the wheel to rest. I got a car, yes, but that drives on diesel, you know? - Diesel? - Diesel. The souped-up Citroën too? On diesel, huh? What Citroën are you talking about? - Oh, right, you never read the paper. - I do, but only the sports news. Sure, since you're responsible for the crime reports... Well... I came here to pay you a visit, not to be insulted. You really were right, you know, Dossena? People were more courageous back then. You also had more courage. Ècoute moi, Mariescallo Tagliaferri. I have nothing to do with those bank robberies. - Nothing! You got that? - Ah, finally. I have an alibi as big as the Coliseum! - You're welcome to check it. - I know. I just wanted to hear it from you. Well, now I told you. - Goodbye. - See you. I'm always at your service. Oh, right, Maresciallo Tagliaferri... ...are you interested in the advice of an old enemy? You will only catch them sitting on their horses... ...or you'll never get them. You will only catch them sitting on their horses... ...or you'll never get them. Is that exactly how he said it? - Exactly. - Is it really so hard... ...to catch them with a different approach? If Il Nizzardo hadn't come here, probably not. But he was here. Which means, he feels quite safe in all other matters. What can we do? I have no idea. Tagliaferri, you got the right idea in your head. I just know it. Now spit it out so we don't have to think about it anymore. Well, I'm thinking about smuggling a snitch into the gang. They’d have to take him in somehow. We could give it a try. But who? A driver? - A driver, sure. - What are you talking about? Il Nizzardo's guys are all extremely good drivers. - They’re real specialists. - Our guy will be too. - You have someone in mind? - Palma. - And I also need the Ferrari. - Which one? - That one...? - Yes, that one. But that's no Ferrari anymore, that thing's just junk. I'll take care of transforming it back into a Ferrari. Don't worry. Do whatever you think. You have my permission. - Hello, boss. - Hey, hello. - Good afternoon. - Hey there. That’s Palma's notice, right? That’s my business. Careful, Tagliaferri, we're not at the station. - I'm not your guy anymore. - You've never been my guy. But I'll ensure you will be. I won't take orders from no one. Especially not from you! In this world, you have to learn to spit blood. You're just a blabbermouth. All you have is courage, and nothing else. So you're only an asshole... ...but you could become a good driver. I swear I'll make you one. Will you tear this up or should I do it? Tear it up, sir. You weren't that formal a moment ago. Yeah, but a moment ago I was still a real asshole. It's yours now. But I don't know if... Listen, boy, you've been busting my balls for two years with that shit. Now you have to carry on. Now I want you to do it. We have to show them who we are, Palma. If they screw us again, we're done. They’ll screw the legal authorities and us as well. Then they won't be fearing anything anymore. Come on. Boss, this part of the body is completely demolished. A dent every 8 inches. How's that possible? Yeah, that axle... It was Il Nizzardo, right? That cost him five years in Regina Coeli prison back then. - That must've been a great satisfaction, right? - You'll get there. But now we got to put our back into it, got it? The hardest part is yet to come. What did you think? Idiot. The way you drive the serpentine, you'll never make it. Listen, you can only use the gas pedal. A short brake before you're there, and then you accelerate. Brake, then accelerate. And never touch the clutch. Go it? Go now. Show me. To not lose speed in a difficult curve... ...you need to keep an eye on the vanishing point. That’s nothing else but the highest point of a curve. The crucial point. As soon as you've reached it... ...pull the handbrake, steer in the opposite direction... ...and accelerate immediately to a high speed. It's easy, you see? What is it? Come on now. Goddamn it. I can't do it. - I will never do it. - But... I told you: You'll be spitting blood. I've spit enough blood. That’s it. No! Only I say "that's it". And I haven't said it yet. This time I'll say it: That’s it. You give up? I can't hear you. - I give up. - Oh, you're giving up. You think it's that easy? We're up to our necks in this thing. You and me, my friend. In all my life I never did anything halfway. - I did, though. - I don't care about what you do. - Exactly. - Now you're making a fuss... - So I can go then. - No! - Get another guy. - No. Perhaps I'm not cut out for this. I'm an idiot. You said so very often. - Maybe you were wrong about me. - I'm never wrong. You got what it takes to be a champion. That’s what I said and I'll repeat it. - Repeat it. - Kiss my ass. Put on your suit and get back on the track, idiot. In my days it was different. Today, you really need to know these things. Do I have to hit the heart? No, it's enough if you hit the target. - You mean like this? - Where did you learn that? Taught it myself, in the countryside. Three days at the beginning of your training surely aren't enough. Well then... What do I need that for? Your arm needs to be higher. Well, it went okay... And here are the facts of your new identity: Volpez Moreno, born in Newcastle, Australia. British mother, Italian father. Formula 2 race driver. Arrested in Monza due to drug consumption. Now you continue. Released after a year. Stopped driving races. - I worked for the Marseille clan. - And then? After a few months as a smuggler I went freelance. - And then? - Export of foreign currencies. I got caught in Chiasso and went to prison for two years. Two became three because of an attempted escape with my buddies... ...whose names... whose names... Here, take another look. There it is: Beppe la Malfa, armed robbery... ...and Bruno Lacanà, arms trafficking. That’s enough. You need to go over that again. Listen, you have to convince them that you're really good with a car. That shouldn't be so hard, right, boss? When you're with them, if they take you in... ...it's your mission to give us the day, the time and the place of the robbery. And remember to tell us all planned escape routes. Only if we have everything, we can set an effective trap for them. In the beginning they'll be very suspicious. So be on guard. The smallest mistake, the slightest suspicion, could be fatal. - Where can I find them? - At Gianicolo. Remember: You have to brag, then they'll approach you. - Is that all? - That’s all. That’s all. Palma. The name's Moreno. What is it, boss? I think I told you everything. Oh, yes, one more thing: Courage, Palma. If you got it, you will only know in the very last moment. Francesca. What are you doing here at this hour? Ever since you're back on duty, you completely disappeared. You're right. I was very busy, you know. New things came up, and I'm not done with them yet. Come on upstairs, I'll explain it. Get in. I can see you're a little concerned. We won't be able to see each other for a while, you know? - Are you going on a trip? - In a way. A special assignment? No, nothing special. No need to worry. It's just duty, something completely normal. - Since when are you doing something normal? - Now it is something normal. And if it's dangerous...? Don't you worry. In order not to worry, I mustn't love you. Oh, because you love me? Since when? - Who's that? - This is the second time he's here. - I don't like his face. - Did you see what he's driving? - He's a guy looking for trouble. - Let's not think about it anymore. You think we mess with every smart ass who crosses our path? - Who cares? It'll be amusing. - Come on now, let's go. Come on. All right. Let's go. There’s nothing else to do anyway. - Hey, I'll handle him, okay? - Yeah. Now we'll get something to laugh... - Look, what a nice car he has. - It has a lovely polish. - How fast do you think it can go? - Did you see that taillight? Hey, look at that. Man, he really gave it a spit shine. - I'm sure he even goes to bed with it. - You can say that again. - I'll ask him if he could wash mine too. - Yeah, do that. Look, how nice... Such pretty seats. Excuse me. Listen, is that jalopy yours? Yes, she's mine, but she's no jalopy. You're trying to tell me that's a car? - And a great one at that - when I drive it. - Good grief. So that thing's even got an engine. I told you so. How should I know? I saw pedals on that thing. Well, I guess you were wrong then. - Try to pedal off yourselves now. - No, no. Now that I know that this thing has an engine, I wanna buy it. - How much? - She's not for sale. And you also have to be able to drive her. You hear? You also have to be able to drive her. Listen, I don't find that funny, okay? And you can drive her? I don't know. If you want to find out, you have to pay for it. You hear that? He's a betting man. Darling, did they send you here or did you come all by yourself? Peppe la Malfa sent me. You know him? - Who? The stutterer? - But isn't he...? That’s where I was until three months ago. So you got a car? This one. It's my brother's, but it runs well. - When will we meet? - Tonight. When it's dark. Let's do that: Whoever makes it first through the arc of Villa Ciarla. Deal? Deal. But without looking at the street. You mean blindfolded? Lying down. But if you're scared... Wait. Easy. Where are you going? - Listen, my name's Moreno. - I'm Diego. - Half. - Half a million? I got the money. No, pretty boy, we'll give the money to the cashier, huh? All right, you take the left one, it's wider. I'll take the other one. Come on, let's go. - Oh, dear son of a bitch... - What an impact... You got it, huh? Now you've destroyed my car. How did he manage to drive right through the arc? You couldn't even see it. He followed the power line of the trolleybus, you asshole. That’s how he did it. Take a look. See them now? That’s exactly how he saw them. - He can kiss my ass. - Listen up. - Who is that son of a bitch? - A certain Moreno. He says he's the best driver and races everybody into the ground. - Hey. He can't say that. - But he did. And he did it to me. Let's see if he can do it to me. - Mean machine, huh? - I bet. Considering the price tag. Yeah, beats a Kawasaki. I think I want one of those too. Make way. I was told here's someone who feels mighty strong when he's in a car. - Who's that genius? - That would be me. - Will you race me? - Yeah. What's the stake? Whatever you like. The car. - When? - Right now if you dare. Let's go. So? Did you enjoy the warm-up lap? - You could say so. - Now listen up. See that scarp? Exactly the right spot for a little dare. We'll now drive up to the scarp... ...and who's the closest to it without dropping in wins. Deal? Yeah, that's okay with me. But we'll do it with a turn. The rear of the car has to be next to the edge, huh? With a turn? Come on, your turn! Hey, Pistone! Did you fall into the hole, huh? You can shove your hole! The worst part is I fell into the trash. Looks pretty good on you. Bye! What a son of a bitch! I guess that rat is capable of telling everybody. By the way, Pistone, how did the story with that guy end? What guy? Didn't you tell me about that guy who was bragging in front of your brother? - Ah, that one! - Yes. - You shut his trap, huh? - Shut his trap? He didn't even manage to open it. He still doesn't know what happened to him. - Did you bet on the same horse again? - On Lugard? Sure. - To me he's a failure. - He won't just win the race... - ...but also the combination bet. - What? Him? They’ll outpace him in the next curve. Mon dieu! With ankle joints like his? You really don't know a thing about horses. You know what I did with horses during the war... ...when a mounted carabiniere chased after me? First, I beat him up and then I ate his horse. That’s how you became such an asshole. Have them pay out the winnings. I'll see you outside. Merde. - Someone boxed us in. - Oh, shit. We can't get out if he doesn't move. I'll go look for the owner and get the keys. - No, go check if it's unlocked. - Go check if it's unlocked. That’s no way to park your car. And of all cars it's standing right in front of ours! Can't be helped, everything's locked. - All right, Pistone, open it. - Open it? With what? Are you nuts? When the owner comes back, he'll shoot the three of us. - I don't want to lose time. Open it. - Stop, wait a minute! Oh, it's you? I'm sorry. I'll drive it away in a second. You know him? - What are you talking about? You know me. - Well, do you know him or not? - I think I saw him once. - You think? A few days ago I sent him into the trash. - The impact must've gone to your head. - I can't remember. "He still doesn't know what happened to him." My compliments. Pistone's a tough cookie. I always say: The tougher the cookie, the better. Listen, where did you find the Ferrari? In Como. - One of those once cost me a lot. - It only cost me a million. No, one and a half million, since I had to fix the brakes and the dampers. Why don't you join us at Grillo's this evening? With pleasure. - See you, pretty boy. - I don't know you. It really wasn't necessary to invite him to the restaurant. He could be useful to me, as a third car. You really want to let him join us? At the moment, I just want to study him a little... Then learn him by heart. - It's a risky endeavor. - Less risky than others. The secret is to cross the border at exactly the right moment. But does it pay? Yeah, quite well. It was even the banks that paid me for it. Ah, what do you know! And then they say we're the bank robbers. Those Swiss... They have a huge interest in capital flight. They gave me the names of the Italians I then went to see. Then I took the money and brought it to Switzerland. - Always with the Ferrari? - No. I switched cars probably ten times. - Are you still working for them? - I wish. I got caught in Chiasso, and that was the end of it. Once you get caught, you're out. That’s the right way, isn't it? Excuse me. No bugs, boss. The car's clean. Listen, do you like horses? Yeah, all of them. From those with four legs up to those with car taxes. Look, the legs are just like pistons. And the nostrils are nothing else but exhaust pipes. It's fantastic. The accelerator sits in their chest. They can smell it if you want the max. It's just like owning a car. Could I start all over again, I would work with horses. Instead, we now have a really shitty life. It's not a shitty life, it's our life. And it's the one we were destined to have. They always say it's society's fault. Bullshit. Society has its rules, just like a game. - Who doesn't follow them, will pay. - That’s what I think. You know, Moreno... ...Pistone and the others are empty inside. But you're different. - A night with lots of fire, huh? - The two of them were real hungry. Tell me, Moreno, are you flush? - It hasn't been raining for a while. - Would you like to work with me? - It depends. - Hey... ...if Il Nizzardo wants something, it only depends on Il Nizzardo. Remember that. All right, how much do you want? Forget it. - If I tell you, you'll get angry. - No, tell me. You're a friend. I won't get angry. Only because it's you: 50 for me, 50 for you. - Who do you think you are? - The best you can find. - Words. - Facts. - Is it just enough for Pistone? - Not just for him. Wait a minute. Are you maybe trying to challenge me? You can cross out "maybe". You know, this is the right day for it. Let's go. Tell me, Moreno, what are the stakes if you don't have any money? - 50% of the business, right? - Bien. Sounds reasonable. It's not easy to accomplish a jump like that. But there's a secret. It's all about acceleration. You always have to go 80. Not much more and not much less. Always keep it at 80. That’s it. Fantastic. It's actually real easy. But only few know about it. Listen, why do you want me to know? If you got courage, you'd find out yourself sooner or later. If you don't have courage, however, it's just like I wouldn't have told you anything. Well... All right, 50%. There’s a job coming up and I want you in. A big coup, mon chèr. - Any news? - No, nothing yet. Let's hope it's Palma. - Hello? - It's me, Palma. - Tell me, were you successful? - I'm in. Very good. Soon they'll tell me the details of the robbery. Good work, my boy. - All right. I'll call you again. - All right, very well. It worked. And you will drive to Prenestino. Agreed? Okay. - Do all of you know the routes? - Yeah. Yeah, but what about the bank? You will read about it in the newspapers. The weapons. - New stuff, huh? - Hurry up. I want to go to the garage... - ...to check the cars. - For you. Here. Take it. Very nice, Moreno, that way nobody sees it, huh? Hey, boss. Did you see how Moreno carries his gun? Back at his butt just like the pigs. I've always carried it like that. What if he's not the one he pretends to be? - What do we know about him anyway? - Stop it, Pistone. Wait a minute, your stakes in this are just as high as ours. So let's try to stay calm. You were totally right, you know? Pistone's not only empty here... - ...but also here. - You miserable son of... Don't try that again. You haven't really understood the lesson from the other day yet. Think of something else to discredit me. Who tells us that you're really Moreno? Do you know Moreno? No. Then who tells you I'm not? Stop it, all right? You can get information on me everywhere. Maybe it's for the better if I won't do it. - Doubts can cause difficult situations. - No, stay. I wouldn't let you go anyway. Don't you think? - It's fun to drive it, right? - Yes, but the expenses... I know, but if this one or another, it needs to be for paid for either way. Sure, but life gets more expensive by the day. It's getting more difficult to afford something. - Well, then don't buy it. - I know... But how can you get by these days if you don't have a car? - One moment, please. - Yes, sure. Excuse me, where did Marco go? - Who? - Marco. He was with you a minute ago. When did he get back? Um, yesterday. - And is he back on duty already? - Yes. - I don't know where the garage is. - You haven't been there yet? No, but I think it's somewhere in Τrionfale. - Okay, give me the routes. - The first car... Palma, hello...? Palma! Palma? What's going on? - What do you want? - Francesca, run! Marco! Quick, Pistone, hop in. Hurry! Merde! Dirty son of a bitch. - What now? - They scrammed, Maresciallo. - Let's go, guys. - That was predictable, huh? Shit! After all that work... Don't sweat it. It's just a question of time... - ...until he comes out of the woodwork. - Yeah, but the question is when. We just need to be ready. We'll catch him sooner or later. You bet. I told you what I'm gonna do. Now you have to decide for yourselves. - Do we really want to keep listening to him? - Make way. - The earlier we disappear, the better. - Get lost then. With that arm of yours I have no use for you anyway. You don't get it. We're all leaving. - You have to do the robbery on your own. - Well, who's staying with me? He's definitely crazy. - We stay. - Bien. Where are you going? Hey! - They’ll get themselves killed. - Don't play assholes. Don't you understand that you will have to pay the price? Pay the price? You don't understand this form of payment, do you? The banks will close in half an hour. Are you absolutely positive he'll follow through with the robbery? - If I were him, I would. - Commercial bank in Via del Corso. Palma, here we go. Commercial bank in Via del Corso. As soon as I have the data I'll give you the position. They just went past Castel Sant'Angelo. Palma, be careful. Go straight ahead, along the Tiber, then across the bridge Ponte Sisto. Now towards Trionfale. Listen, it's better if you take the ring. Now they're driving towards the city limits. They just came out of an underpass. Palma, now go straight ahead towards Villa Torini. Then straight ahead until the crossing. They’ve just reached the alley. Attention, Palma, you're almost there. Boss, I got him. Now you're on your own. Step on it. Boss, he's here. He came. Boys, let's dance. Don't shoot! Run! Freeze, Dossena! The way you caught me... ...it could have also been accomplished by a traffic cop. I'm not afraid of you. I will give you one last chance. - But make it fast. - Yes, fast. And he simply got away, just like that? Just be patient. I'm sure there'll be a second time. There’s always a second time. Right, Palma? Are you ready? Let's go.
