Hi, babe. Dinner's almost ready. Wha... What... Where... Where am I? How did I get here? Where's... my phone? Where's my phone? Where are my glasses? Shh, shh, shh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. - Hi, Isaac. - You're late. And you broke the Freezy machine. It's on the fritz! I haven't touched it. Yeah, you did. If you hadn't, it wouldn't be on the fritz, now, would it? Okay. I'll take a look. Hey. Let's checky-check that gloomy mug at the door, huh? Better not be greeting my customers with that sad-sack shit. You smell like... failure. After you're done with the Freezy machine, clean up whatever happened in the bathroom, okay? Devereaux! I'm watching you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sorry. Hold on. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. Hold on. Ch-Charlie? Charlie? Hi, beautiful. I'm gonna give you another chance to remember what we are together. ♪ I go out walkin' ♪ ♪ After midnight... ♪ Stop. How long have you been filming me? None of your business. Keep going. No. Okay. Taste-test the sauce, and if it's the best Bolognese you've ever had, you give me a song. Okay. You are gonna love this. Okay. All right. Oh, my G... Ah. Right? I don't know, maybe a little too much tarragon. What? You owe me a song. You owe me a song. You're right. It's amazing again. ♪ I go out walkin' ♪ Untie me, Charlie. ♪ After midnight ♪ Untie me. ♪ Searching for you ♪ Please.Nah. Charlie, what are you even trying to do? I decided to forgive you for humiliating me. Breaking up with me days after my father threw me off the board was revealing of your character. Now, I know I used a little too much tarragon last time. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. There you go. Hi. As I was saying, I, uh, know I used a little too much tarragon last time, but, uh, this time, I practiced restraint. What is wrong with you? Might be the best batch yet. Seriously? Please? Mm-mm. Come on. Come here. Oh, no, no. Open. There you go. There you go. There you go. You should know I'm not willing to live the rest of my life wondering what your life is like without me. What? The only way... that I can move on... You know, I hated my father's hunting trips. Every year, being dragged to some English countryside to trudge acres of dreary terrain. But... I grew an admiration for hunters. The patience and precision it takes to make a kill. Please. Even though taking a life at a distance lacks... a level of intimacy, don't you think? I mean, the butchering process comes close if you do it right away. Mm-hmm. To stick your hands in between the warmth of another creature's organs. I only know one other time I've ever been inside another's body. Please. Oh. No. I wouldn't end you with such a barbaric tool. No. This is for after. Because we both know the most intimate way to end a life requires... skin to skin, heartbeat... to heartbeat... touch. You can still change your mind and sing for me. Come on. Sing for me. I can't. Sing for me! Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just, uh... I'm still a little woozy from whatever you gave me. Um, could I have my glasses, please? Please? Can I see you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving when things were hard. I... And you-you didn't tell me why. I did. No, you-you didn't. You just left. Okay. You're right. And I'm sorry. I've just been so stressed with work at the hospital, you know? But, um, maybe if-if we talk, if we go to therapy. I mean, yeah, that's-that's... that's all I want. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, willing to try. It's been really hard for me. I know. I know, Charlie. Um, can I please look at you in the eyes? Please? Here. Thank you. I just want to see you, you know? Will you sing for me? Uh-huh. Yeah. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. No, no, you make the caterers get to the boat two hours before the guests. No later. Gas grades aren't clear. They're not clear? They're not clear. I just pumped 87 into my Beemer because the markings are all fucked-up and faded. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. This is more than an inconvenience. That is a European luxury vehicle over there. It should only sip 91 gas. I want a full refund. The gas is already in your car. That is because you are not running a professional business establishment. I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't give you a refund for wrongly pumped gas. "Wrongly pumped gas"? That's what you're going with? What is that smell? Oh, my God. This place is fucking disgusting. There is no way this place is up to code. I am calling the Better Business Bureau. I'm gonna have this redneck shithole place shut down. What'd you say your name was? I'll give you a refund. That's what I thought. It's gonna take two to three business days. "Two to three business days." With an attitude like that, that's gonna get you a one-way ticket to fucking nowhere. Is it okay if I just... Few of these? Oh, and... Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Please. Okay. Oh, shit. Come on, come on. Emily! No, no, no, no, no, no. Please pick up. Please pick up. Please. Please pick... 911. What is your emergency? Oh, thank God. Okay, my name is Emily Kasahara. I've been drugged and kidnapped by my ex, Charlie Bellwick. I don't know where I am, but I'm somewhere in the forest, and I can't see anything because I broke my glasses. Okay. Where is the kidnapper now? I don't know, but I heard him yell my name, so he's close. Okay. Well, we're gonna figure out where you are and get you help ASAP. Are location services enabled on your phone? No. I thought that he was using them to track me, so I turned them off. That's okay. I have your number, so we can work with your carrier to determine your location. Okay. How long until the police get here? I won't know until we locate your exact position, but it can take up to an hour to work with your carrier and local dispatch. What? Can't you go any faster? We'll go as fast as we can, Emily. Okay, well, I can't see anything. Could you video-call me and guide me to somewhere safe? Unfortunately, we do not have video capabilities, and it's against regulations to use our personal devices. Against regulations? Are you kidding me? I'm about to get killed. Emily, can you feel around for a hiding place? I can't stay in one place, or he's gonna find... Okay. Oh... oh, no. No, no, no. No. No, no, no. No. Please, please work. Please, please, please. Okay. Um... Uh... - Hello? - Hello? Who is this? It's Sam. Who's this? Are you 911? No. Uh... Oh, sh... I'm... I think... I think maybe I, um, accidentally dialed you earlier. Shh, shh, shh, shh. What? Shh! Hello? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I think it was an animal. Oh, my God. I'm gonna go. No, no, no, no. Wait. Wait. Can... Can you do video calls, Sam? Uh, yeah. Why? Okay. Listen. My name is Emily, and I have been kidnapped. I can't see anything because I broke my glasses, and all that I know is that I am in the woods somewhere and my ex is coming to kill me. What? Look, I just... I need you to be my eyes for me. C-Can you... can you do that? Is this a scam or something? 'Cause... No. I promise you that this is very real. If I can't get away from him, he's going to kill me. I don't... Look, I know that this sounds like nonsense, but please. Please, will you call me back? Why-why don't I call 911 for you? Because I already called them, and their fucking regulations won't let them video-call me. They're working to find my location, but, um, it's gonna take a while, so I just... I have to... I-I don't think that... My phone screen is really broken. If you hang up, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make another call. I-I don't think I'm the person to do this for you. I... All you need to do is be my eyes for me. That's it. Please. Look, I need to keep running. I need to, and I can't do it alone. If I don't... If I don't, I... Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, thank you. So, um, just-just video-call me back. Yeah. Uh, I-I'm... I'm gonna hang up now. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Damn it. Oh, thank God. I got worried. Sorry. I, um, just needed a second. All right, I need to figure out which way to go, so can you tell me what you see? Trees. Yeah. Trees. You're in a forest. Okay. Uh, is there a clearing in any direction? Uh, uh, yeah, uh, to your left. Uh, maybe it'll be faster without the trees. Great. All right, now, I need you to look behind me and make sure he's not there, okay? Okay. Uh... Wait. Stop. What was it? I thought I saw something move. I-I guess it was nothing. It was nothing. It's just, um... Okay, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I, um... I should... I should... I should probably call someone else for you, because I just... I just can't. I can't. No. You're doing great. Sam, I'm gonna need you to take a deep breath for me, okay? In... and out. Look, I-I know that this is a lot, but it's a miracle I got you. Miracle? Yes. A miracle. Okay. Can you do another 360? Yes, I can. Which way, Sam? Which way? Okay, stop. The clearing's to your right. Right. Okay. Any obstructions? Um, yeah, there's a-a tree. Step to your left. Good? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you're at the field now. Great. What do you see? Is there a house? Um, a landmark? A road anywhere? Uh... Um... stop. I think I see a-a path across the field. Great. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Um, there hasn't been any sign of him for a while, which is good, but, um... I'll keep doing 360s in case, and if you see him, you just have to give me a shout, okay, and I'll just start running. Oh, it sparkles. And just make sure that I don't trip on anything. Hey, um, are you sure I can't call, uh, family or friend, have them call you back? What? No. I haven't memorized a number since middle school. Uh, it's just I'm at work, and-and I am... I'm so not good under stress, like... Can you see your own hands, Sam? Yeah. Then you are better-equipped than me. Right, uh... Please, listen. Um... God, I'm so jealous. Uh, I-I've had shit eyes since I was a kid. Do you know what they used to called me back then? Four Eyes? Nope. They would scream "Missu Golightulee" at me. What's that? Bullshit in Breakfast at Tiffany's. You never saw it? White actor in yellow face with the taped-back eyes and, lucky for me, glasses. Yeah, yeah. I saw clips on YouTube. It's-it's horrible. Yeah, I begged my mom for LASIK, but I was too young. Then when I got older, I chose not to get it, thinking that people would take me more seriously as a doctor if I had glasses on. Pretty stupid decision in hindsight, huh? You know, when I was little, the kids playing Power Rangers, they would make me be Rita Repulsa. Oh, wait, is that the evil lady with the staff? Yeah, and the nickname stuck all the way through high school. Repulsa was written all over my senior yearbook. God, kids can be such shit. Yeah. But hey, uh, Rita was, like, a... a badass space witch, right? Yeah. I guess. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Let's just, uh... Are we near the path yet? Oh, no. What? I'm so sorry, Emily. What is it? It's not a path. It's just a fallen tree. Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry. How could I have thought that that was a path? What is... what is wrong with me? I'm so sorry. Nothing is wrong with you. Okay? It's fine. Let's just keep going. Okay, but what if... what if I missed sending you a better way? You didn't lead me back to the cabin, did you? No, no, but I... Hey, it's okay. What is it? My wrists are, uh, zip-tied, and I'm losing circulation. I got to get 'em off. Zip-tied? Oh, my God. And I didn't... I didn't even realize. Okay. Uh, hold on. Let me see. Okay, I'm gonna stop for a sec here, so you just have to check behind me to make sure that he's not here, okay? Oh, no. What? Is he there? Did you see him? What? Oh, no. No, it's just my-my battery's low, but don't worry. Okay? I have a charger. Jesus. You scared me. Sorry. I'm sorry. My phone was fully charged when I left for my run this morning, but I have no idea how much I have left now. Damn it. Maybe if you find me, like, a rock or something, I could, uh... Is that Russian? Uh, I think so. It's a video. I never imagined getting murdered would feel so absurd. Hey, okay? No one is getting murdered today. Now, Sergei says you need to use your teeth to tighten the zip ties. Sergei says tighten 'em? Yeah. The tighter they are, the easier they'll snap. Now, bring your hands down to your knee as you bring your knee up. You should probably put the phone down. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Ready? One. Two. Three. Emily? Hold on. Hold on. Are you okay? I will be, as long as he didn't hear me. Did the ties come off? Yep. Yes! Sergei for the win. Hey, but are-are you okay? Uh, it cut me up, but there are no major blood vessels here, so we're good. Oh, no. You sure it's okay? Yep. Perks of being an ER doctor. Okay. Okay, let's go. Do you see anything else around here that looks promising? I don't know. I-I don't... It just... It all... it all looks the same. Hey. Uh, if you got lost in the woods on one of your hunting trips, what would you do? I wouldn't get lost. Yeah, but if you did. Hey, we-we got to go. Come on. One sec. Uh... Wouldn't happen. Right, but just... just humor me, dude. I guess my best bet would be to find a stream, river. Chances are it'll lead me to civilization, if there's any around. Okay. In my belly. Hello? One sec. Four sixty-five. Four sixty-five for a dog? That's highway robbery. Someone might've left their card. Keep the change. Please don't come back. What? Okay, did you hear that? About the water? Yeah, I heard, but, uh, I left my divining rod at home. How do we find a stream, Sam? Hold on. Okay, it says that birds can lead you to water. That, uh, "in the evenings especially, following the flight path of birds could lead you to H2O." Wait. I heard a flock of birds fly above me a few minutes ago. Okay, great. Uh, which way did they go? I think it's this way. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Can you do another 360? No sign of him. I think we might be safe for a little bit. Just keep-keep walking, okay? Damn. It's starting to get chilly. Where are you? It's lukewarm and humid here. You want to trade? Yeah. Come on over, Sam. Take my place. Um, I'm in Michigan, I-I think. Unless he crossed state lines. Where are you? Uh, Florida. Oh, man. Florida, beaches.Shit. Do you live near the ocean? No, uh, Tallahassee is a few hours from the ocean. Used to, though. Uh, Jacksonville's a couple minutes from the water. I loved it. Why did you move away? A lot of things. Yeah. I can't believe you're a doctor. You look so young. Yeah, it's the bane of my existence, Sam. Even interns make Doogie Howser jokes at me. Oh, God, I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. When I'm 70, I'll look 40, and no one will force me to retire. Can I, um... can I ask you a question? Sure. What pushed you to be a doctor? My mom is an ER nurse, and she worked crazy hours, too. So when I was little, I made this vow that I'd become a doctor so that I could be in the hospital, too, and we could spend more time together. It didn't exactly turn out that way, but, uh, now I just... I want to work really hard so that I can give her an easier life, you know? That's really nice. Yeah, uh, but... you know, she... she hates flying alone, and... and she kept asking me when I'd be able to take time off work so that I could go with her to visit my grandma in Japan. But I never did. I never did, and, uh... You know, it's, like, the only thing that my mom, like, ever asked of me ever, and now... I don't know... I don't know if I'm gonna, uh... No. Okay? No. Um, you're... you're gonna buy tickets just as soon as you get back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, of course. You said you were a cashier? Yeah, yeah, at this-this really weird gator-themed gas station. It's a dream career. Hey, well, at least it's... No. Uh-uh. No, don't try and make it something it's not. Okay? It's what was available. Well, they need cashiers everywhere. You could go back to Jacksonville, work at a gas station near the beach. Uh, yeah, yeah, I just, um, got to take care of a few things first. How long have you worked there? Um, few years. I, uh... I moved back to help my mom. And then she had some health issues. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, how's she doing now? She's not. She... She passed, so... Oh, I'm so sorry, Sam. But hey, you know, that-that is admirable that you stopped your life to help her. I mean, I'm sure she's really grateful that you were there for her, you know? Yeah. Maybe, yeah. Wait. Do you hear that? I hear water. Can you see anything? Uh, not yet. Just keep going, okay? Okay. Well, I found a lot of water but not the kind we're looking for. All right. See anything? Uh, not yet. Wait, wait. I see it. Okay, there's... There's a river down below. Oh, great work, Sam. Yes. Okay. All right, let's get me down there. Okay. Hey, oh, um, careful. It's a drop-off. Um, let's just find an easier spot, uh, for you to climb down. Okay, okay. Tell me when you see something, okay? Son of a bitch. What? No, no, no, no, no. Sam, Sam, is it still too steep? Hey, Sam, Sam, is it still too steep here? Um, just-just hold on, okay? Just... Yeah? Um, shit. Just hold on one second, okay? Ah, shit! Shit. Emily, are you there? Emily, I can't see you. Emily, are you okay? Oh, God. Ah, shit. Thank God. I can't see you. I have my earbud, but I dropped my phone. Where are you? Okay. Okay. Where are you, Sam? Um, I'm... I'm looking away from the river, uh, towards the forest. Okay, um... God, I'm sorry. Okay, I was distracted. Okay. I think I'm going away from the river. Hold on. Stay. Do you see me yet? No, not yet. Can you see any movement? No. I think I see some grass or, um... There's a forest. I don't quite know. No, come on. Maybe if I just... Okay. Wait. I hear an engine. That's great. That's great. Okay, let's go find 'em. I think he's here. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. I see him. You're okay. To your left, to your left. Yeah, right there.

You were so rude earlier that I left my Amex. Um, just give me a moment, okay? Absolutely not. I am missing my fête de yacht because of you, because of how rude you were. You probably don't speak French, but that means "yacht party." Okay, just give me one second, okay? There is a woman who is about to get murdered. What kind of crack are you smoking? Shit!

Please. - Please. - Go. Well, just slow down. Oh, that... that is bullshit. Oh, fuck wind speed. You tell that driver he is not weaseling out of this just to keep our deposit. You're a... Do you know what that means? That's "shithead" in French. Cut off some of the Williams Sonoma cheese, but don't eat any until I get back. I'll be there in ten. Little bitch! Fucking... Okay. Fucking trailer trash cunt! Give that back to me now! Eat all the Williams Sonoma cheese you want. You know, in the wild, there are these, uh, pack hunters. Animals that rely on others to live. But, you see, I have always seen myself... Shut up! Shut the fuck up! I am so sick of your blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! No one wants to hear you talk, Charlie. I mean, you think of yourself as this modern-day alpha male philosopher? Well, you're just a spoiled, rich trust-fund kid that parrots back bad TED Talks. Yeah! They're bad! I called 911. They have your name. They're tracking my location, and they're on their way right now. What, are you still gonna go through with this? You're gonna get caught, Charlie. Sure. But there's a difference between getting caught and being convicted. You don't get to do this to me and get away with it. Now, what do you have to say for yourself? I don't care, Charlie. I don't care. Kill me if you want, but you, you do not get to murder me and play the victim. I am the victim. Are you kidding me? No, the victim of your abandonment. Neglect. My... After I gave you everything. The romantic surprises, the trips, the emotional support. Are you forgetting the jealousy? Are you forgetting the stalking? The holes in my wall? The bruises? Well, you pushed me there. Look, how am I supposed to feel when you would rather spend 100-hour weeks with disgusting sick people than with me? But you're so addicted to the validation that you get at work... I am not. What you will never understand, Charlie, is that some people do things for other things besides validation. I work my fucking ass off so that my mom can have a better life. Your mom? It's not for your mom! God, how many times did I see you ignore her calls? You see, the truth is, Em... Do not call me that. You've convinced yourself that you work so much to be a good daughter, but it actually makes you a fucking horrible one. A horrible daughter and a completely neglectful partner to me. This is what you do, Charlie. You find what hurts in people, and then... and then... and then you use it like a weapon. Doesn't mean I'm wrong. Stop. No! Stop! Fuck! Hey, fuck. I want my fucking phone back, you bitch. For the last time, it's an emergency. Whose fucking emergency is it? It's not my emergency. My emergency is that you took my fucking phone! I'm not afraid of you. All right. You want a fucking war? You got one. You better start fucking praying. Okay. Fuck. I thought it was in this one. No, no, no, no, no. Nobody does this to me. Where are you, you gator fuck? Come out, come out. You hiding from me? Shit. Shit. Got a little surprise for you. Okay. Don't shoot, okay? I can't afford to get shot. I don't have insurance. You deserve a bullet for putting your filthy hands on my phone. That case costs more than you make in a year. It's 24-karat gold. Now, hand it over. Okay. Now! No, not on the f... You fuck! Okay. Okay. Okay. What? What does it say? Call Hubby Wubby. Fuck. Okay. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed. Okay. Eight, one, zero, one, four, seven, zero, one, five, five. Okay. Uh... Man, what the hell? Okay, um... Three, eight. Three, eight. Okay. Okay. Call. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yello? Seriously? Eight, five. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please. Emily? Sam? You found a phone. Thank God. Are you okay? Not great. I lost my earbud. Um, can you get up? Okay, we got to go. We got to do the 360, okay? It's dark. Now we both can't see. Yeah, I can... I can... I can still spot his flashlight, though, right? I'm just gonna lay here until he finds me. No, your phone, it has a flashlight. I can walk you through, uh, turning it on, okay? You're just gonna... That would just make it easier for him to spot me. Okay. Okay. So, um... so, what are we gonna do? Hey. Sam? Yeah? None of this is your fault, okay? I asked you to do a pretty impossible thing. And I'm sorry. No, Emily. No, no, no, no, you can't, okay? I need you to call someone for me. Can you do that, Sam? No. No, let's just... Let's keep going, right? Let's keep going. Call the landline and put it on speaker. No, let's just go. Okay? Let's just go. The number is... eight, one, zero, one, two, six, zero, one, nine, seven. Hey. I thought you hadn't memorized any numbers since middle school. Yeah, well, sometimes it's easier to show a stranger how much you fucked up. Please... don't make me ask you again. Hello? Hi, Mom. Em, what's this number you're calling from? My friend's phone. Is everything okay? I'm sorry. For what? I... You were right, and I should've listened to you, and I'm... I'm sorry that I got mad at you. What has he done to you? Deep down, I think that I knew that you were right, but I indulged anyway. Em, where are you? I'm sorry that I didn't come see you more. That I didn't take off work. I always made excuses. I'm going to come get you. Just tell me where you are. I love you so much, Mom. Tell me where you are, Em. I'm sorry. Thank you for everything. Thank you for... for making me strong, and I'm sorry. Emily, tell me what's going on. This is probably the last time that we're gonna... A light. Emily. Emily, there's a light. A light went on behind you, okay? It could be a house. Em, what's happening? We can get to it. It's not far. I don't know. Just get up, okay? Just get up. I can barely stand now, Sam. Emily. You know how... You know how you said that you're sure... you're so sure that my mom was happy I was there with her when she passed? Yeah. I wasn't there. Okay, I needed... I needed a break. I needed a break from her and from her sickness, and so I went out and I got drunk, and I left and... By the time I got back home, I... Shit. I left her, and she... died, okay? And I wanted to leave you tonight, too, so bad, okay? I was... scared. But you, you asked me to stay. Okay? So I stayed, right? And now what? What? You're just gonna... you're gonna give up? No, no. No, you are not allowed, okay? You, you are not allowed to give up. Em, who is that? It's Sam, Mom. Who's Sam? She's my friend. Oh. Then listen to Sam. Goddamn it, get up. Em, get up! Just get up. I can't. Get up. - Get up. - Emily, you can do it. He's gonna find me no matter what I do. He's gonna... he's gonna find me. No, no. Emily, I'm not gonna leave you. Just get up. Come on, honey. Get up. Okay, you just... you just have to get up. Okay? I am right here. I didn't leave. I'm right here. Okay? Go. Just get up. Just get up, please. Is there really a light? - Yes, yes, yes. - You can do this, okay? Listen to your friend. She's gonna help you. Just come home. I think maybe I see it. It's there. Okay, trust me. Okay. Okay, Sam. Lead me to the light. Yes! Honey, go. You can do it. Sam? Yeah, we're almost there. Just keep going. I see it. Right up ahead. What is it? It's a barn. Okay, let's see if there's a house nearby. Scan. Okay. Shit. I see his flashlight. Turn around. Get in the barn. Straight. It's in front of you. All right, what do you see? I need a weapon. Uh, I see hay, shelves, some-some sort of chemicals, um, uh, uh, stairs going up. What, no pitchfork? Axe? Gun? No. No, not yet. God. What else is there? What is that? What the fuck? Sam, what's wrong? Sam. He's close. What are we gonna do? Sam, are you there? Hello? Shit. Okay. You need to hide. Okay. All right, which way? Anything look good? Um, go to your... go to your right. Your right, behind that shelf. Sam? Hello? Is there anything here? Hello? Sam. Holy shit. What? Oh, God. What happened? What happened? Let us in, little bitch. Go away! Sam, what is happening over there? Open this fucking door! There-there is a couple here, and, well, they... they have guns. What do you... what do you mean, they have guns? I took this woman's phone to call you, and... Let us in! Her and her husband, well, they are not happy about it, okay? You ruined my fête de yacht! - Oh, my God. - You will pay for that! Sam, if they have guns, you have to call the police. No, no, no, no. I really... I really did steal the phone, so, um, you know, if, uh... if I call the police, they're gonna come and they're gonna... they would take it away from me. I need you safe first. Move back. Okay, baby. Oh, shit. Sam. What happened? What happened? Are you okay? Are you hurt? I just, um... Uh, why don't you, uh, keep showing me the shelves, okay? Just show me the shelves. Okay. Okay. Anything here? No, no, no. Nothing. Give me the phone. Give her the phone back! Give us the phone! You want to catch one right between the eyes? Give her the fucking phone back! Give us the phone! Look at you, you fucking ugly piece of shit! Sam. What is this? - Uh... - Give me the phone. Do you hear him, bitch? Give him the phone! Give me the phone. I have an idea. What in God's green fuck is going on here? Hey! I own this establishment, you sons of... Whoa. Your cunt employee snagged my new phone, and I want it back now! Uh, uh, m-my deepest apologies. - N-N-N-Now! Get up! - Okay. All right. Yes, ma'am. She's been nothing but a nuisance. I never should've hired her. Now! Yes. Devereaux! Open up now. Ready? I think so. - Devereaux! - Stupid redneck. You can't even control one employee? I'm so sorry, ma'am. Let's go! Okay. All right. Hey, Devereaux, I'm calling the cops. Your ass is going to jail! Sometime today. Come on! Hello? I got some trash that needs taking out. Sam, he's gonna hear all the noise coming from over there. Hey, ball sack, let's go! Sam, you got to stop the noise. Open up. Open up now! You better get in there right now! I want this bitch! Fuck it! Let's go! He's gonna hear. I know, I know, okay? I got to think. I got to think. Motherfucker! What the... Come on, asshole. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Get in there. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I can mute myself. What? But-but how will I know when it's time? No, no, no. I will send you a text when he's in the spot. You'll hear a ping. But what if he doesn't go to the spot, Sam? I can't know what's happening if you can't talk to me. Hey, hey. We just have to trust that it's gonna work. But-but-but... Just, I have to mute myself, okay? No.This is gonna work. It's gonna work, okay? - He is not gonna beat us. - Come on, get in there! Open the fuck up! Sam. Oh, G... There you go. Get in there. We're coming for you. That's right! Come on, come on. Get him, Emily! Yes! Yes! Get him, Emily! Push him over the edge! Push him harder!

Let's go! Hands up! Let's see your hands! She's coming out. Keep those hands where we can see 'em. Get ready to go. Hey! Hey. Oh, wait. Mom, Mom, say hi. It's Sam. Hi, Sam. - Hi, Yuko. - Can you please get Emily to fold her clothes a little faster so we don't miss our flight? I'm almost done. Anyway, what's up? Um, so I wanted to tell you I'm gonna try and go back to school. Hell yes, Sam. That is what I'm talking about. Yes! Yeah, it's, um, terrifying, but I'm... I'm excited. And I was just wondering, um, could I take you up on your offer to help me with my application? Look over my essay? Oh, my God, of course. I would love to. Yeah, just send it to me whenever you're ready. Okay. I will. Oh, I've been meaning to ask you, who were you trying to call last month, anyway? I was just trying to order a pizza, I think. Pizza? Really? Wow. Love that a wrong pizza number saved my life. Me, too. Oh, oh, Lyft is here. Lyft is here. Okay, we got to go. Okay. Enjoy your trip. Thank you.
