FRANCE, WORLD WAR II BRESSON MANSION, PARIS SUBURBAN - I count on you. - Yes. Hello. On here. Let's go. Well then. Deliver what you have, professor Bresson. I have nothing for you, Nazi worms. Are you alright? LUPIN III: THE FIRST CREATED BY MONKEY PUNCH YEARS LATER, IN PARIS Ladies and gentlemen! We have something special that we are proud to present. It is a great mystery by the renowned and distinguished professor Bresson. Bresson's diary! The lucky guy who reads the diary in that box you will get many treasures. That's what the legend says. I heard that even the Nazis wanted this diary. Sir! We were warned of yet another Lupine III crime! What did you say? "I'm going to take action today to steal Bresson's diary." "Lupine III." Keep the diary in the safe for now! I take care of that. Wait. That face... Inspector Zenigata! I caught the suspect of being Lupine! Lupine! I got you! He came running to deliver the warning, but he didn't shed a sweat! This one is smart! Got you! See you! Wait! You won't run away, Lupine! Shoot! To the next! Let's go! Curse! Damn it, Lupine! Inspector, the diary must be in the safe! Take care of it! Come here! Follow her. Yes sir! This way. I... Excuse me! Are you a thief too? - Was anyone hurt? - I'm sorry! I caught a big fish! It was bad, but I need to keep it. Who would have thought you were a thief too? Stop it! Did you freak out? Calm down, woman! You have no idea the value of this! I know better than you. Don't be a thief if you have no determination. To the next! Go! Go! Go! Jump! Perfect! Please give me back! I'm sorry, girl... but I am a real thief. So this diary belongs to me. Thank you, Lupine! Now he's mine! Fujiko, if you keep my diary, there will be war! Lupine! Geezer! Was he betrayed again by people like you? Get him! Stay on the floor! You fools! He's right there! And arrest that other thief! Let me go! What? I'm sorry, Grandpa. I failed. I don't do this kind of work! Useless girl. Forget. The reinforcement takes account of the situation. But the deal I made with you is over. Professor Lambert. Sir. Cheer up, my dear. I just received information that we got Bresson's estimated daily. Yet... as everyone knows, it has an unbreakable mechanism. We need to open it, whatever the cost. It is essential that we break the code. She's here, sir. That woman has arrived. Mr. Geralt... Let's go? Here it is, as promised. Finally I have it in hand... Indeed. It took a long time to get there. I apologize, sir. Where's my reward? It's there. See, this is the keyhole. These two parts are interconnected. Mr. Geralt, that matches my research. Wait. A tracker? Did you plan to get to the treasure of Bresson's diary first? - You thief! - Come on. Hey, old man... Didn't you play hard? This time, you will not escape. Bresson's diary is the only object that Arsène Lupine was unable to steal. I understand why his grandson would like to try to make up for this failure. So this is the end... Only not! They arrived! Stop that car! Bye-bye! Wait! Come back here! How problematic. What a bag. Damn handcuffs. Why did it take so long, Jigen? Goemon? Thank you for going after you, Lupine. It looks like you just ran away from the circus. Took! Let's get ourselves together and go back to Bresson's diary! The diary talks about a treasure that may or may not exist. Turn around. Damn, how cruel, Jigen. Is it so then? Okay, I will find an incredible treasure and I will not share it with you. What? What's it? It can not be. It's impossible. This was the key to Bresson's diary. I want to know what the problem is. So... You see, we're almost there, Mr. Geralt. These excuses make me want to throw up. Never repeat that again! You useless old man. Are you a thief too? That's why I said. You are not for that. What? Why are you here? Oh the pain. Look what was in your shoe. Damn, how much book. What you want? Aren't you after the same treasure? Treasure? What you mean? Do you know about the "eclipse"? Like when the moon blocks the sunlight? So you know what I'm talking about! - Did you write this thesis? - Drop it! Is it archeology? I knew it! It's your hobby, isn't it? That's right. But I am not like you. Archeology is the only way to discover the truth about the past. See, that's how we talk to people in the past. Damn, it is a beautiful feat to have gathered all this material. Look that. It must be the pair of this one. Why are you with this? I inherited it from my grandfather. So it was stolen. How dare you say that? Listen, tell me something. Where did you see that key? Calm down a little. Is it okay if I change clothes first? Yes? Do not look! Hello, grandpa? Lupine is here. He came to my apartment. He has the same key as us. I think there are two keys. That explains everything. I'll give you another chance, Laetitia. I want you to bring Lupine to me with the other key. But I... I don't want to work with a thief. Really? If you can do that... I will reconsider the small agreement that we made. BOSTON ARCHEOLOGY UNIVERSITY Let's make a Deal. I will give you the information I have. In return, you work with me to solve the mystery of the diary. Why would I want to work with such an incompetent thief? Nevermind. It may be bad for you, but the information is right here. There are many ways to extract information, you know that, right? You're not that kind of guy, are you? You are the greatest thief in the world. So, let's work together. Just like Bresson! What do you mean, like Bresson? They say he had a partner who funded the research. Are you talking about Adolf Hitler? Don't talk nonsense! Bresson lost his life so the eclipse would not stay with the Nazis! My bad. I understood. But he also left a trail. Here in Bresson's diary. Don't you want to know why? I want to know. I want to solve the mystery of the eclipse! So beauty. I will work with you. Per hour. Really? I'm without Jigen and the guys. I think it will be just you and me. Checkers first. I got it! By the way... Laetitia. In case you want to know my name. It's Laetitia. Laetitia? Are we really going to the right place to get the key? He has no address... but I know that the cargo ship comes into contact with him every week. I still don't trust you. Laetitia is a false name, isn't it? As well? Can you explain that to me? MY WEDDING DAY LAETITIA It's your mom, correct? Laetitia is her name. Yes. But I'm also called Laetitia. It is customary to give the name "Laetitia" to all the girls in the family. This is an excuse for lazy people. Anyway... My parents died in an accident when I was young. At least that's what I deduced from the photo. What are we waiting for? I talked. He has no fixed address. We are about to unlock Bresson's diary. All that's left now is to find the other key. So this is where she is? - Thanks. - Available. It must be easy for you, right? After all, you are the famous thief, Lupine III. But of course! - That's it! - Amazing. Finally. The dream that my grandfather did not fulfill. What's it? I don't know, I had a strange feeling. It looks like I've touched this before. Lupine, let's go quickly. It will be difficult to get away with all this increased security. We have no choice. Let's open it right here. I really thought it was to form a key combining the two pieces. Is that how you use it? It won't open with just the key. You need a password. A password? Do you see the recorded lyrics? The mechanism activates with the key and shows the correct sequence. Pay attention. Arming the mechanism will activate a bomb. The diary and the person who wants to unlock it will explode to pieces. Bresson really wanted to keep it a secret. And I would also want someone to open it. A genius at unraveling codes. A cryptanalysis specialist. Someone who loves treasures more than anything. Are you talking about yourself? How are we going to rearrange the lyrics to create the password that opens this thing? We have five letters. Here it indicates that the word has eight letters. Understand. We just need to find out what the password is. Calm down! What happened? You started the timer. We have less than a minute to explode! I should have said from the beginning that it could happen! What a thing! Calm down, woman. A, E, I, I, T... An eight letter word. Did you think of something? What is? What is the word? A word that has to do with Bresson! It can not be. Wait. It will be possible? Have you found out? There's no other. It can only be this. What if I'm wrong? You need to be sure. Or the diary will explode. It will explode if we don't try anything. Come on. Amazing! I got it right. How awesome! It was fantastic! How did you find out? It was going to take too long to explain. Let's see what's in the diary. "The eclipse is a gift from an ancient civilization." Wow, you really know how to read that. It is ancient Hebrew. Because he used an ancient language, Bresson wanted an archaeologist to read the diary. Now it is in Scythian language. "If you are not able to receive such preciousness... then close it again." A gift... The eclipse was an infinite energy generator! "Coudée". This is French. It means cubit. One cubit is 444 mm. If you multiply, the result is 39,960. - Forty kilometers. - And the "City of the Gods?" Can't you deduce just seeing the image? It's Teotihuacan, in Mexico! You are awesome. I did not speak? It is my field of study. Now it is written in Akkadian. "To reach the eclipse..." I think there are three trials! Here shows how to achieve, but... I got it. So this is protection. What? What are you doing, Laetitia? I'm sorry, Lupine. Isn't it early to apologize? You need the bullets to shoot. I told you that to be a thief you need to get in head first. Why don't they stop rolling and get in soon? Or should I go over there? You knew we were waiting, Lupine III. It was the only entrance. What are you going to do now? The situation puts you at a disadvantage. The only option is to surrender. - Hans! - Yes sir! Here's what you wanted, Grandpa Lambert. So is he your grandfather? Good job, Laetitia. Will you be able to solve the rest yourself? You broke your head a long time to open the mechanism, didn't you? Don't be so arrogant just because you're good at puzzles, Lupine! My skill unlocked the diary that you couldn't open! Bold! I have already been chosen as a founding member from an incredibly distinguished research institute! Take it easy! Now you're bragging about the past? What is the name? Speak the name of this famous institute! It's Ahnenerbe, isn't it? Ahnenerbe? What do you think about doing with the eclipse? Shut up! Shut your mouth! You are no longer of use to us! Hans! Take this arrogant thief away! Yes sir! What are you going to do with it? Don't tell me you got attached, my granddaughter. Of course not. He's just a thief. So... I wanted to talk to you. What you want? I did what you asked, didn't I? I don't need to do anything like that anymore, right? Will you comply with our agreement? Boston University, is that it? The archeology department there is one of the best in the world. - Do you think you can keep up? - I really want to try to go there! In fact, they already accepted my application. Don't say nonsense! How dare you do this to me? Forgot... who took you from that worthless orphanage and created you today? - You ungrateful! - I'm so sorry! I can't thank you for everything you did for me! But I don't want to steal and cheat people anymore! I really want to study archeology. I want to become an archaeologist, like Bresson! You grew up, didn't you, my granddaughter? When this is over, you can go to university or wherever you want. Really? Thank you, grandpa! That's right! You fear the girl's talent, don't you? As well? The article written by you, which received much praise, it seems to be plagiarism of something she wrote. After all, talent is hereditary, isn't it? Shouldn't you thank her, professor? How dare you... Everyone is trying to humiliate me, is that it? Look, if it's not Fujiko! I didn't think I would see you here! Lupine! It looks like karma got you for cheating on me. Shut up! No small talk! Behave yourself. Wow, how beautiful you look today. Could you come closer for me to take a look? Now, is it not that you are really cute? This was good! Now that you're here, Lupine, this place is going to get a lot more chaotic. Will you leave me behind? But what cruelty! On here. Good luck, Lupine. Couldn't you have moved closer? There she is! Thank you so much for the plane! What are we going to say to Mr. Geralt? You can say you took a nap. Please take a look at this. It is exactly what I predicted. The eclipse is a massive weapon of surprising power. He even describes how to use it. Very well, Lambert. I know he will be extremely happy when he gets his hands on the eclipse. "He"? It is true? Is the Führer alive? You may have heard that the Führer escaped to South America the day Berlin collapsed. I am sure he is alive. This photograph is undeniable proof. It's incredible! The photo was taken in Brazil recently. The Führer and the eclipse. Perhaps with the two together, they can relive the third reich! You old fool. Rebirth is more than certain! - Laetitia! - What did you hear? Say what you heard! Is what you're saying true? Did you know from the beginning that the eclipse was a weapon? "If you are not able to receive such preciousness... then close it again." "The method for braking is described here." Ahnenerbe. I investigated and discovered that it was a Nazi research institute. It was part of the SS. What do you plan to do with the gun? What are you doing? End it with your own hands. That innocent sense of justice... You raised that girl very wrong! It will end up disrupting our plan. Understood? If your loyalty to the Führer is real, you will do your duty. Or are you not able, Lambert? The girl can still be useful to us! Lost your courage, old man. You are the most useless of all. Wait! You are crazy! Remember? That's how we talk to whoever came before us. I'm falling? Am I really falling? Parachute! Hello, young lady! What a coincidence to see you here. Lupine! I wanted to help, but I jumped off the plane without thinking too. As well? You're crazy? Come on, Lupine! Help me! Lupine! Which is? I can always count on you, Fujiko! This is going to be expensive, Lupine. Maybe I can pay with my little body? You are so stupid... Calm down, were you mad? How much insistence! Hold on tight. I'll lose the guys! Slower please! Laetitia! That's it! Down here! Jump! - Thanks. - No need to thank. What's it? Here I go! But what? Jigen, you idiot! Didn't you see that my hands are busy? They're coming back! That was close. Yeah. In fact, why are you here? Fujiko told us that you opened Bresson's diary. You would have it all alone! You only show up when you have money in the middle! What do we do? They will activate the eclipse! - Lupine! - Do not worry. I'll find a way. I don't think we have a choice but to ask him. What's your plan, Lupine? There's a guy who would come after me anywhere in the world. Hello? Lupine! Finally decided to surrender huh? It is admirable of you to tell me your exact location. At last I'm going to arrest him. Stay where you are! But what the hell is that? Lupine! Wow, has he found out yet? Lupine! Come back here, Lupine! Thanks for the ride, old man! Inspector! Jump! Lupine! Damn, it's all for an old man, huh?! Did you like that, boy? I know it's hard to believe. No, Interpol has been concerned with Ahnenerbe's movements for years. We even created a special task force to fight the resurgence of the Nazis. It is not hard to believe what you said. These guys are about to get a beautiful weapon of mass destruction. Let's make a truce. What do you say? On here! Sit alone! I will never cooperate with you! Please! Trust us. I will cooperate, whatever the cost! Really? OIL PLATFORM IN THE ATLANTIC COAST Finish refueling as soon as possible! Yes sir! What are you thinking? I helped Ahnenerbe without knowing it. I even became a thief. Why did my grandfather do this? He's not really your grandfather. Cut that one. What nonsense have you invented now? You were adopted by Lambert when you were little. Do you know why? Because he was my only relative. You were the legitimate heir to the key and there was a possibility to know the password. Lambert took you out of the orphanage and created it to be a doormat that even steals others. This is absurd. What are you talking about? In fact, it was his name. Laetitia. Eight letters. Five different letters. Laetitia. The password I used was your name. You understand what that means, right? Her real grandfather was Bresson. I too would be in shock. But that explains why your name is the password. Bresson's diary was unlocked with his name. But... And his passion for archeology is proof. You can't help yourself even if you try. This only increases, doesn't it? I am the same way. It's in my blood. That's how we talk to whoever came before us. That's true? Can I really believe that? Yes. I swear on my life. I took this when we ran away. It was yours from the start. I can't... I can't believe it. If it's really true, then I did something terrible! Because of my stupidity, the diary is in the hands of the bandits! God, how did it end up in my jacket? We will reach Teotihuacan in about two hours. That miserable one! The game is not over yet. But why Professor Bresson... I mean, why my real grandfather. Didn't you destroy the eclipse when you had the chance? I think he wanted to believe that human beings they would be able to do that one day. He must have been a very idealistic man! You have to be an idealist to become an archaeologist, Lupine. To be a thief too. I don't know, I had a strange feeling. It looks like I've touched this before. My body knew it from the beginning. Than? He just lied that he hadn't stolen the diary! Lupine I designed this complex lock. It was my grandfather! See that Lupine flower? It has to do with my family. Lupine. So that means that Professor Bresson's partner was... Lupine! Laetitia! Come on! The fact that we ran into each other could be part of their plan! Well then, let's make them proud! FORTY KILOMETERS NORTH TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO Look at that symbol! There is no doubt, they are the ruins of the eclipse! Hans, go ahead. Did you come here to be afraid? Help! Help me! It looks like you can't get by without Bresson's diary. What do you intend to do, Lambert? The diary was unlocked only to be stolen by a thief. It's embarrassing! Mr Geralt, the eclipse is there, we cannot give up like that! You saw what happened! Do you really think we can do it without the diary? What do you want me to do? What are you up to? I think they're about to fight. Are preparing to return to the accident site in order to try to find the diary. It will be a while before I get back here. That was what I wanted. It's fantastic! These are the ruins of the eclipse. And this is the fatal result if we continue our journey. The first ordeal. It is mentioned how to avoid this in the language in which the text is written. And what would be? Akkadian. The Hammurabi Code is famous for being written in Akkadian... Is it the one that says "an eye for an eye"? What is it, Goemon? Watch those eyes. An eyeball is missing! One of those globes should do! It can only be a joke. Let me know when you find it. What is going on? What was this? Apparently, the creators of the eclipse knew how to manipulate gravity. It is not right. Any progress? It is not that either. Lupine! Amazing. How awesome! What's up? I think it stopped. This will be useful. What's written? "The fifth king of the first Uruk dynasty had a dream before your friend's arrival." What is this talk about Uruk dynasty? Is easy. It has to do with King Gilgamesh. But did he dream of his friend? So? Dream about stars falling on you. Stars falling on you? What does that mean? Mr Jigen! The stars that fall on us. A meteorite? Should be it! Lupine, hand over your meteorite. Of course, miss. It's for now. As if I was going to walk with one. You always have strange things in your pocket. So there is nothing we can do. Goemon! What's it? Leave me alone! I already got it! Your Zantetsu... must be a Ryusei-Ken. What are you talking about, old man? A Ryusei-Ken it is a blade forged from meteorite-derived iron. Is that true, Goemon? Do not know! Even if it's true, I refuse. Please, Goemon! I will not lend my blade. What if Zantetsu-Ken is ruined? Goemon! Stop freaking out and look back. What about? Thanks. Goemon! Let's go! I will stay here. What you mean? Hurry up. I don't like using Zantetsu-Ken for such an unworthy task... Goodbye for now. I'll be back to pick you up. - That can't be right! - What do you say? "The final judgment..." It's death row. "Use someone's physical skills to overcome it." Lupine can do that, can't he? If you can run to reach the cathedral... it seems that other trials are going to be deactivated. I don't have much of a choice. Will soon! Okay, now it's for real! Lupine, that is... Is it my grandfather's hat? What is yours? I can do this! How awesome. Grandmother. Grandpa, I did it. Great. You are very good at solving puzzles. They came back here a little quick, didn't they? Did they forget something? In fact, only a few of the boys left. However, I think we cheated you and your group of thieves. It was bad, they caught us. What a thing... You have a lot of courage to tie someone from Interpol. You'll regret it! Lupine, that crazy machine there that was the treasure of the eclipse? I believe so. Where's the gold, silver and diamonds? That is not what you promised me! If I had Zantetsu-Ken, we wouldn't need to be humiliated like that by these bastards. This is the gift of an ancient civilization to the Führer! I finally got it. I put my hands on the eclipse. Laetitia, give me Bresson's diary. What are you waiting for? I will not work for you. I work only for Professor Bresson, my real grandfather. Well then. It looks like you found out everything. But it is too late. What do you think will happen if they know... who stole it? - You forced me! - But you're the thief here. I kept all the evidence. The press will love this news: "Granddaughter of the renowned professor Bresson conspired with the thief Lupine III and is arrested for stealing diaries!" Imagine that! - Stop! - Give up! You will never be a successful archaeologist like Bresson was! You will do what I say for the rest of your life! It will never be the center of attention! That is up to me! The eclipse has been reborn! Get up. Come back! Don't leave us here! That bunch of idiots! They will pay for it! Zantetsu-Ken! Zantetsu-Ken! Sit down. Damn it! Okay, let's save you! Lupine! Folks! This will be a proper use of Zantetsu-Ken! Get out, Fujiko! They will activate the eclipse! Understood! Now let's unlock the power of the eclipse! Keep your eyes open and watch! Lupine and everyone else will disappear and cease to exist. Do not do it! Leave everyone alone! Stop! Not! What the hell! What is this crap, Lupine? It is capable of destroying the whole world. I need to speak to Interpol. I'm going to use the radio. Lupine! Folks! Is it a black hole micro generator? Very well, Lambert! You will regain academic prestige. Academic prestige? What a banal thing! Now that I've gained all that power, do you really think I care about that? As well? It is such a trivial and useless thing. Do you have any idea what you did? Now that I have the eclipse... I have no more reason to be faithful to Ahnenerbe! You lost your mind! What is that look? Is this how you see the person who has cared for you all your life? You ungrateful girl! You are wrong. You created me only to use me in your plans. And finally he managed to do them. These futile achievements will disappear in the blink of an eye. How can someone who studies history not see this? When you saved me from the orphanage... you really loved archeology. But you have changed! Quiet! Shut up! Even after witnessing my power, dare you call me futile? Why? Why don't you recognize my victories? I was very upset by your accusations. Will spend the rest of your life miserable suffering for hearing everyone's lament! What are you doing? I will destroy Ahnenerbe's headquarters... and the whole city of Berlin! The world will fear my power and surrender to me! - Did you freak out? - Watch what you say! I am the man who will control the whole world! Got crazy? The only one who can be the ruler of the world is our Führer Hitler! What are you doing? Stop it now! Grandmother! - Why did it? - I do not know. I thought you were just a tool. Grandmother! He died like the crazy old man he always was. Ended. I will generate a small black hole. All your terrible plans are gone! How dare you? So you can't use it again anytime soon? Ahnenerbe headquarters for Mr. Geralt! Immediately transport the eclipse obtained to Brazil. We located the Führer! The Führer! He knew that His Excellency was alive! The Führer wants to see the eclipse as soon as possible. I knew that day would come! AHNENERBE, HEADQUARTERS OF BRAZIL Führer! Is that really you, Führer? You are Geralt, aren't you? Thanks to your efforts, I will be able to see the light of day again. I am grateful for your kind words. It is a pleasure to serve. This is the eclipse, correct? I am sure that we will be able to relive the third reich with him. Magnificent! Excellent work, Mr. Geralt! Look... this gun of yours... I'm glad you noticed, sir. It's a Mauser. A pistol from the third reich. I remember... It's such a wonderful pistol... Stop her! Who is this girl? She is the granddaughter of Professor Bresson. What do you plan to do with the world? My young lady. I just want to create an amazing world... governed by exceptional people. What disrespect! This is unforgivable! Sorry, my Führer! Get her out of here. Get rid of it. Take it! The eclipse... fell into the hands of the devil! Well, I would like to see the eclipse up close. This is what controls it. This starts and the other changes direction. This is not the ideal place! I will not use it here. It's not safe. If I do this, it will work. I understand everything. Führer, your legs... Oh my! It's a miracle! Only not! Why the sad face, Laetitia? Mr Jigen! Folks! There were reports of the eclipse movement, so Interpol took action. We take the place and then transmit... a false communication to capture Geralt here. I appreciate your cooperation, Laetitia... I mean .. Miss Bresson! Yes! We got off the jet using a parachute. I didn't expect the old man to fight by our side. Life is full of surprises. Where's Lupine? I do not believe. You are... Well, I think it caught me in the act. I fooled a sucker! Where's the Führer? What you do with him? Well, he died a long time ago. You didn't learn that at school, did you? He died in 1945. But what about that photo? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Interpol created the photo and circulated it to see if anyone would reveal himself. They play pretty dirty, don't they? I can't believe this! Don't mock the Führer! It was bad, I took out all the bullets before. Why are you doing this? I came to destroy this, of course! And thank you so much for teaching me how to operate! - Damn it! - I will kill you! What a violence. I was afraid! Why does a thief of your kind have to get in my way? It is easy to explain. We thieves love to live emotional situations. You will die! You will pay dearly! Die! That's it! Damn you! I can't help it! Idiot! Do you want to die together? Parachute! I will not let you run away! Bye-bye! You will die too! I'll worry about it only after I kill you, Lupine! Führer! Damn you! Führer... Stay with her. You deserve. I put an end to everything, grandpa. Lupine! Lupine... It looks like Lupine is out of the picture. I can already concentrate on arresting you... Run! Well, you... Lupine! - Lupine! - Calm down! You did it, Lupine! The eclipse is gone. You don't have to worry anymore. Everything went well, didn't it? Yeah. Humans are immature to deal with something with such power. - Lupine... - Lupine! Always on time, Fujiko. I took these things from their collection. It took a lot of work to end up empty handed. See you soon, Lupine! Lupine! Quickly! The old man is after us. Damn, will that nut never give up? This is where we say goodbye. Won't you take me with you? It is no longer tied to an old boss. You can go wherever you want. Coming with us was not going to be a good idea. Lupine... I'm kind of tired to take care of newbies. You know how it is. How cruel! See you in about five years. Take care. Leave it to me. Before I forget, I have to deliver this. It's from Boston University. Why do you have the letter? Wait. How did you submit my thesis? I stole from your apartment and sent it. Good luck. They said they are always looking for a talented candidate. Your very great thief! Lupine! See you, miss! Come back here, Lupine! Lupine! Got you! Oh my. I WISH TO CONTINUE SENDING LUPIN FOR ADVENTURES WORLDWIDE. MONKEY PUNCH, JULY 2017
