I’m here to speak about the word of our lord God. - We are sick of the Word of God! - But let me - I’m telling you. To me, the bonus is what really makes the difference. To reach the numbers always on time and to show rhythm, rhythm! That’s what is all about. And of course, you need to diversify. For example, right now we are between 6 and 8 SKU’s. Those numbers, not even Koestinger at his best. You end up exhausted, naturally. But, I rather that instead of being responsible of the terminally ill. I really don’t want to be in charge of them. I leave that to La Planchada’. "Fireballs" directed by Christian Cueva and Ricardo Farias I like to work freelance from time to time.

The same ones she told me here, in this house, in this same room. I can assure you they are not true. If your grandmother was alive, she would tell you herself that she made them up. - What are you doing here? - My aunt told me you where here... Why didn’t you tell me? - You know I always come here on the weekends. - Eli is waiting for us, are you coming? - I can’t - Edgar you told us you were coming. - I can’t... - My dad is mad at me. - My uncle?

Yes grandma. - Those animals can’t stay outside at night. - Why not grandma? Child, I already told you. - Tell me again. - We keep them inside because you are sleepy and you haven't drank any water. But I’m not thirsty! - Your soul is like a pigeon, if you go to sleep without drinking water... It comes out to search for some. - It comes out to drink water? Yes, and if you wake up and it hasn’t come back... It never will. - And what happens to me? - The same thing that happens to everybody. - Edgar!! Are you okay son? - Edgar!! - I’m thirsty - Edgar, son... - I’m thirsty...
