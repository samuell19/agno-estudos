(MACHINE GUN FIRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MURMURING) Herr Hauptmann. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (MURMURING) Major, I have orders. You and your men are to leave at 1200 hours for Tobruk. Tobruk? That's crazy! Those are my orders! But that's an active war zone. As prisoners of war, we're supposed to be sent to a safe area. Tobruk is now ours, Major. I assure you, it is very safe. TARKINGTON: The Geneva Convention has explicit rules on what... HAUPTMANN: We observe those rules. Your side was notified yesterday about this. Heil Hitler. You will do that too. So prepare. We leave immediately. And what if we refuse to go? We leave you here. Then you will see, Major, there are worse things than dysentery. Merrihew? Sir. Pack it. Yes, sir. (SCOFFS) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SHOUTING IN ITALIAN) (SHOUTING CONTINUES) (YELLING IN GERMAN) Why don't you speak English, you kraut? What seems to be the problem, signorina? Why I am not leaving on that plane to Tobruk? Why? Signorina Gagliardo, special air transportation calls for special authority. I got! Ecco. "Any courtesy shown the bearer will greatly oblige "General Giordano Fanduci, commanding officer, Ariete Division." Yes, I know about your position with the general. Position? You're attached to his staff. Extremely attached. He is molto-grando general. You're only a piccolo captain. The Italians are very stylish warriors, but I wish they'd keep their women on a leash. Any other jokes? Yes. You will travel like the rest of us. How is that? In a truck. Continue packing. (GROANS) Ahh! (EXCLAIMS) Amsterdam. The Hollanders, they make good cigars, no? Very nice. The leaf is cured dry like the Sahara. Rommel himself smokes these. Do you know Rommel? Yes. He loves the Sahara. We all do. By "we" I mean the professional military. I'm not a military man, Captain. The war holds no romance for me. The side effects are repulsive. Here there are no side effects. No women, no children, no towns to get in the way. Just men, my doctor. Just men, hmm? Ja, ja, ja. Halt! (GIVING ORDERS IN GERMAN) (REPLIES IN GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Ja. (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) The man is suffering from exposure and severe dehydration. He'll need medical treatment. Give it to him. We'll camp here for tonight. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Corporal, your pulse and respiration are quite normal. Obviously you're shamming. Why? I'm Foster. Your ID tag reads Weatherly, JD. That's my cover. I'm Foster. Captain. 53rd Combat Engineers. Hmm? You don't know? Know what? Eighth Army Intelligence. Captain, Corporal, whatever you are, I've never in my life had contact with intelligence, Eighth Army or otherwise. You are Major Farrel, aren't you? I'm Tarkington, Hugh. Medical corps. I'm a doctor. Where the hell's Farrel? Who? Major, those prisoners in the convoy over there, they are the 5th Commandos, aren't they? No, that's my outfit, the 15th Field Hospital Unit. God damn it to hell! The moment he is conscious, bring him to me for questioning. It may be a little while, Captain. I'm afraid he's in shock. Ja. Ja, ja. RADIO ANNOUNCER: We continue now with a report from CBS London and Edward R. Murrow. MURROW: This is London. The loss of Tobruk will make the problem of supplying Malta even more difficult. And the battle for Egypt may be even now under way. But at the moment, all that can be said is that parliament and the press are looking for someone to blame, and insisting that something be done about it. There's been no question about the conduct of British troops. Their bravery deserved victory, but they were defeated. But Rommel is fond of the unorthodox, and speculation is futile at this stage. Rommel is being reinforced through Tobruk. Tell me, are you a member of the 5th Commandos? Get him out of here. Quite a performance. What in the name of God is that? TARKINGTON: Don't worry, she's real. Belongs to an Italian general. Any more? No, she's the only one. Signorina Vivianne something or other. I don't know. English pigs! She's the only passenger... The only question that interests me... Is what's happened to the bloody 5th Commandos? That's an interesting question. And your having to ask it makes this the bloody muck-up of all time. Who are you? Allan MacKenzie, Sergeant, 5th Commandos. The 5th Commandos? Any others here? Well, we're it. Ed Brown, out of the Gordons. Bill Wembley, Guards. Dan Garth and Reilly. We were left behind when our unit was moved. Acute dysentery. Except me. I got a bad tattoo from Alexandria. Yes, yes, yes. What happened to the others? Shipped to a prison camp in Tunisia. Oh, Jesus Christ! I'm damned if I see why that should surprise anyone. Did he brief you, Major Farrel? Only what he had to. He told us we were going to Tobruk as prisoners. On the way we'd scuttle the German guard and take over the convoy. And according to your credentials, you have expert personal knowledge of the harbor guns at Tobruk. If it's any comfort to you, we had 50 men trained to blow them to hell. You said he only told you what he had to. Any idiot private could spell it out, sir. Rommel is building up supplies in Tobruk for his next attack. He controls the air. The only way to clobber Tobruk is from the sea. The shore guns outrange anything we've got, so to clear the way for Navy, those guns have to be knocked out. That's it, isn't it? That's it. Merrihew, I don't think this concerns us. It does concern you. How many men do you have here? Captain, whatever nonsense you may have in mind, you're not involving my men. They're already involved. At 1700 hours tomorrow, one of our planes will attack this convoy. The purpose was to create enough confusion so that the 5th Commandos could take over this convoy. A deliberate air attack? Nevertheless, that pilot will attack, that pilot will strafe. To contact base and scrub this mission, I have to have a radio. The only way I can do that is by taking over the convoy. That is the only way. And then? After sending off a message, we drive back to British lines. It's a long way, and it's through enemy territory, but with wheels, guns and fuel, and a little luck, who knows? There's one further question. Where is the medical kit kept? I know the truck it's on. But why, sir? We need weapons in order to acquire better weapons. I'll see to it, sir. Good, good. I accept the fact that you're a dedicated warrior, Captain. You will do what you must. But without me or any of my men that don't want to be involved. Sir, I'm a Quaker. I'm in the Medical Corps because I'm a conscientious objector. I cannot help you in a mission where I would have to kill someone. I'm sorry. Sergeant. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING IN GERMAN) (ANNOUNCER CONTINUES) (RADIO SPEECH IN GERMAN) (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (CROWD CHANTING OVER RADIO) Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Ist das nicht ein luger? Nein. Walther. Automatisch. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Wunderschon. Really something, eh, lads? (LAUGHING) (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) Oh, my arm hurts bad. I... I need medicine. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (CROWD CHANTING OVER RADIO) Sieg heil! Sieg heil! (SPEECH CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (SPEECH CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING) (MUSIC PLAYS) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Any of you chaps got the right time? I make it nearly 5:00. REILLY: 1700 hours, eh? MAN 1: How 'bout a tea break, then, Fritz? MAN 2: Or a beer break. MAN 3: 1700 hours, eh? MAN 4: Yes. English one? Yes, yes. English one. Rolex. (SPEAKING GERMAN) FOSTER: That's right, yes. (GUARD SPEAKING GERMAN) FOSTER: Does that mean, "How much does it..." Maybe I'll make a deal with you if you play your cards right. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Uh, that's right. That's right. (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) Uh-huh. Uh, well... 1700 hours! 1700 hours! 1700 hours! REILLY: 1700 hours! (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) (AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARING) (GRUNTS) (GUNFIRE) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) Stay there. (SCREAMING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) God damn you, Foster! You God damn boy scout! (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) Too bad about the radio, sir. Yes. Make up a burial detail, and post a guard over the prisoners. Right. (SHOVELS SCRAPING) Tell me, Corporal, are you familiar with the Geneva Convention concerning the treatment of prisoners? There's more to the Afrika Korps than uniforms, much more. You all will be shot as spies. (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) The burned out truck is hopeless, sir. The others are in good shape and ready to roll. Feed the men. The Germans too, sir? Yes. Right, sir. I haven't found any papers, sir. Got them here. Are they in order? Mmm-hmm. Official passage for a convoy of British prisoners with armed Afrika Korps escort to Tobruk. MacKenzie. Sir. (INDISTINCT CHATTING) I don't know what's going on here, Captain, but we're a long way from our lines. Let's get going... Now. There's been a change of plan. Change of plan? Mmm-hmm. The radio has been blown to bits, so we stick to our original operation. The next step is an airdrop of supplies. Some sophisticated weapons and explosive devices. Do you seriously propose to carry on with this? To raid Tobruk with a hospital unit and four sick commandos? I'm not gonna raid Tobruk. I'm gonna blow up a gun emplacement. Technically it's very simple. The device involved could be carried in your medical kit. But the delivery of that device requires men. So, the truth is, it's a suicide mission. No, no. When the job's done, the Navy picks us up on the beaches. I've no more desire to die than you do. What about them? They remain here. Alive? MACKENZIE: Here comes our supply drop! MAN: Look sharp there, lads! On the double! Cut those supplies loose, and bury the chutes. Hurry it up! MACKENZIE: Get moving! Get over here! Get a move on now. We haven't got the whole bloomin' night. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) I give you my word, all right? What about the girl? She has to stay with us. She's an integral part of the convoy on the official bill of lading. She's yours, Doctor. All yours. Mine? I don't care whether you pay her off in lollipops or cut out her tongue with a knife. She's your responsibility. But the prisoners live. All right, it's a deal. (GUNFIRE) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (THUMPS) (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) All right, lads, over the side. Now then, you grip the rope with the right hand and play it out with the left, holding it tight, but lettin' it out slowly. Easy does it. Pay attention. Your life depends on it. You're not rollin' pills now. Look lively, lads. We're going to teach you how to be commandos in 10 easy lessons. Careful. Careful. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... Pow! Pay attention, all of you. Listen carefully. This weapon can be double-edged. It'll hurt you as much as it hurts the enemy. There are two cylinders, one contains napalm, the other compressed air. You release it by pulling this valve. The air comes up here, you pull the trigger, and inside here is a thing they call an increment. When you press the trigger, this thing spins around and operates like a cigarette lighter. Don't get forward. Never get in front of the machine. Hold it up. Hold it away from you as far as possible. Put your finger on the trigger and press. I'd hate to lead them into a real brannigan at this point, but they're better than I expected, and, well, we'll play it by ear. (VIVI LAUGHING) Silence. Quiet. (LAUGHING) Quiet. Silence. Silence? You know, silence? Silence. What about that girl? I'm afraid she's gonna be difficult. She's unpredictable, sir. He's right. We'll be running into the Nazis in about 100 miles. If she blows the whistle, we've all had it. There must be something we can do. It's a pity you're not a hell-for-leather stud. I beg your pardon? She'd be eating out of your hand in no time, Doctor. Doctor, you're supposed to know about women. Not this kind. I can picture those patients of yours at Harley Street very clearly. A simple emotional appeal doesn't work, although I dare say she has a price. No doubt, no doubt. I gave in on the question of the prisoners. I hope we don't have to pay for that. (VIVI LAUGHS) As far as the girl goes... Let me try again. There's very little time. There's no time, Captain. God's teeth! Hold it! All right, get out. FOSTER: Two full panzer divisions. They're a long way from Tobruk. What are they doing here? Never mind that, Captain. My men are ready. Let's attack. Fork to the left to the sea. That'd be Derna. Our Tobruk road lies straight ahead. (SIGHS) Suspicious, our standing here, sir. Yeah. The name of your other German-speaking man? Garth. Tell him to ride in the rear in the half-track. You come along with me. (LAUGHING) Vivi, shh. Shh. Shall I take care of her, sir? It's not as easy as that. She's listed in the official clearance papers. Captain, you said improvise. You said she's my responsibility. I've got something. Too late for that. I'm a doctor. She'll be taken care of. All right. All right, let's go! (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Ja, ja. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (CONTINUES IN GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) When I suggested we attack the Jerrys, I was venturing a little joke. Surely you understood that? Two panzer divisions. I don't understand that. MACKENZIE: Maybe Rommel's waiting for the right time. Rommel waits for nothing. They might have come off the beaches at Derna. No, they couldn't have. It's the 11th and 21st Panzer Divisions. They're veterans. What are they doing here? Rest camp, parts, repair shops. They could do that in the field. Fuel. It must be fuel. Rommel must have a fuel dump nearby. Heavily camouflaged, because our people don't know a thing about it. It'd have to be underground tanks. Yes, but where? A panzer division without fuel is just so much scrap iron. If we could immobilize two of them at one stroke... But it's all so... You've got no radio, no way of communicating, of channeling this information. How you do go on, Doctor! If I locate the bastards, I'll blow them sky high. Maximum security installation. How do we get in? If you get past that roadblock, you can ask Rommel. Doctor, an emetic, ipecac. That would get us through. We'd give it to some of the boys, and... You've gone crazy! The Germans'll go crazy when they think they're being attacked by an epidemic of typhus fever. You can't fake typhus! We can fake it enough to get us through. I'll get a couple of the lads. Come, Mac. How's our little darlin', then, eh? You're a devil with that scopolamine, Merrihew. I think when the war's over, you ought to go into the white slave business with me. How do you feel? Christ! Bleedin' awful. Good. All right. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (MEN GAGGING) Ja. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Give it to me. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Hauptmann Schroeder, ask the doctor to make a smear test. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (CAR APPROACHING) Rommel. Doctor. Hallo. (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Danke. Gut. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Uh-huh. (FOSTER SPEAKING GERMAN) That is not necessary. It is good of you to help us, Major. Do you really believe they might have typhus? We're making tests now, General, but let's hope it's something less serious. Mmm-hmm. You are being well-treated? Very well, thank you. Good. Despite the circumstances, Herr Field Marshall, I'm particularly pleased to meet you for a rather different reason. You and I share a common hobby. Which is? Philately. You are a stamp collector! I've almost completed a collection of South Pacific issues. Really? I wasn't aware I was known as a philatelist. I mentioned it to the Hauptmann only the other day, Herr Field Marshall, as an irony of war. In fact, I made a little joke about it. How the collector was collected by you. (LAUGHS) President Roosevelt is a famous collector. I'm sure he would like to collect me. (LAUGHING) If time permits, perhaps we could talk. Uh... It isn't very often I meet an expert on stamps. We're, uh, profoundly honored, but I have to take the doctor... A few hours won't make that much difference, and it will give me pleasure. I will send my car for you, eh? Doctor. (CAR DOORS CLOSING) What the devil do you think you're doing? I only wanted... Don't flap. I'm not flapping. You most certainly are. You wanted to find his super-secret petrol dump, and you got yourself onto the base. What happens when they find out this is not an infectious disease? We shall all be vastly relieved. Now, while Erwin and I talk stamps, you start looking and listening. He's not gonna tell you where the bloody fuel dump is! You're all of atwitter. Brace up, Captain. Keep flexible. But that's Rommel! Just another stamp enthusiast, Alex. He probably writes letters to The Times. (HORN HONKS) Relax. It's a tank. Kw-3. (MUMBLING) (MURMURING IN ITALIAN) Vivi, shut up! Come here. I can't! (SCREAMING) Get in there. Anything! Shut her up. She'll have the bleedin' Jerrys over here. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) I'll give you all of my money. I know how you feel. God and sin and all that. But you're doin' this one in the service of His Majesty. Get in there. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (VIVI GIGGLING) (SHUSHING) (VIVI MOANING) (SHUSHING CONTINUES) (VIVI GIGGLING) And I have a complete set of the 1893 Tahitian stamps. Are you familiar with that issue? As a matter of fact, yes. Goring once showed me a collection of Tahitian stamps. Where he got them I have no idea, although I can imagine. ROMMEL: The set must be extremely valuable. TARKINGTON: Yes, quite. It occurs to me that in my own collection, I have some stamps from the South Pacific area. Really? ROMMEL: The Caroline Islands, which was a German possession until World War I. As you know, there were only two original issues during our occupation of the island. TARKINGTON: If I'm not mistaken, sir, you're wrong about that. No, no, no. I'm not. I'm sorry, but you are. 1900, 1910? Yes. Of course! It was the 1915 issue. Huh? But it was never distributed because of the war. If I remember, the 1910 surcharge... Five Pfennig Brown was... Excuse me, Herr General. Excuse me. May I, uh, use your communication center to contact Tobruk and tell them we'll be delayed? Yes, yes. That tent over there. Tell them I approve! You don't agree, huh? TARKINGTON: I most certainly do not. I'm not sure I like you, Doctor. Nor I you, sir. ROMMEL: I don't know if there's any point to continuing this discussion. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann. The Carolines were, as I say, a German possession. So, I ought to know more about their issues than you, my friend. Ought to, yes. But the simple fact of the matter is... You don't. I've not heard one word from you about the 1900 Three Pfennig Brown. That one? Yes, that one! (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) The Five Pfennig stock was destroyed in the big storm. The Typhoon Provisional! Ja! That was it! The Typhoon Provisional. Excuse me, but we must return to our unit immediately. The British doctor is needed to look after British prisoners in Tobruk. Uh-huh. Rudolph! (SPEAKING GERMAN) You cannot imagine what a pleasure this has been for me, Doctor. Perhaps another time we meet again. I do hope so, sir. Who knows? (CHUCKLES) Three Pfennig. (SIGHS) (SHOUTS IN GERMAN) MacKenzie, pack it up. Get 'em outta here. Hurry up! On the double! (ENGINES STARTING) At the next road, we're gonna turn hard left. Take the rest of the convoy and meet at the nearest wadi. If we're not back in an hour, you're on your own. What about the men, the ones that we sent back? They're all right, sir. You were gone so long, I almost began puking. And the girl, is she still under sedation? Sedation? Yes, sir. She's under that right now, sir. Good man, Merrihew. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Nein. (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Any of you boys got a map? Yes, sir. If I get on top of the tank, follow me. Halt!

This looks like a good place. Turn left and then over the gate. Yes, sir! (MACHINE GUN FIRING) There's an 88 on the left, sir. I see it. Ready, Mac? Ready, sir! (GUNS FIRING) Ready, Mac? Ready, sir. (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) (MACHINE GUN FIRING) To the right, a pump station. Yes, sir! (GUN FIRING) (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) (SHOUTING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING) Reilly, get us outta here! Yes, sir! (TANK RUMBLING) (COUGHING) You all right? Yes, sir. (GRUNTING) (STRAINING) (EXHALES) (CLANKING) This thing is stuck! Damn! It's stuck! It's stuck! It's stuck!

(SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (GERMAN CONTINUES) (GERMAN CONTINUES) (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) As I recall it, your plan was merely to escape. As it happens, would you want it any other way? I suppose not. Anyway, Alex, do you seriously propose to carry on with this escapade? I mean, those guns and... At 2100 hours, the ships are steaming into Tobruk Harbor. I only hope we're not too late. I like it here away from the roads, but what's lacking is a snowstorm or a sandstorm to cover our tracks. Reilly, turn onto those tank tracks. When we reach Tobruk, according to plans at 2100 hours, 5th Commando unit will have knocked out the shore guns. And we will move in close and open fire on the area. Landing craft will be launched to take the commandos off. What if they fail, sir? We do our part, I hope they'll do theirs. Field police. You can't use those again, Alex. Chew them up or swallow them or something. Reilly, keep up with 'em. (SOFTLY) If you can't fight 'em, join 'em. (PHONE RINGING) Jawohl. Hauptmann Schroeder? Hauptmann Schroeder. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Nein. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Nein. Moment! (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Well, now we're in, which way do we go? Capt. Foster was quartered here in Tobruk until Rommel broke his lease. All right, Merrihew, get her out. German pigs! English pigs! I hate them all. I hate them. How is she? I think she'll be all right. Has she any idea where we're going? Going? She hasn't the foggiest idea where she is, or anything. Good, get her out. Ciao. Ciao. (ENGINES RUMBLING) Ciao. That's it, gentlemen. The British Navy's target for tonight if... If we succeed. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Nein. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Ja. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Ja.

About the girl, my conduct... Yes? Dear boy, overnight you've become a legend among men. Don't spoil it. I don't want to... Turn off that remarkable conscience, Merrihew. Remember, virtue has its own reward. You've gotta knock out those pillboxes, Mac, before we can get at the guns. See you on the beach later. Right, sir. MACKENZIE: Look sharp. The Navy's on time. I only hope... (CANNON FIRE) All right, Mac, now. Now! Now! Now! Mac, now! Now! Now, Mac. (FIRING CONTINUES) FOSTER: All of you, now! (ARTILLERY FIRES) (DISTANT ARTILLERY FIRING) (MACHINE GUNS FIRING) (GIRL LAUGHING) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SCREAMS) Hurry up, Mac, hurry up. (MACHINE GUN FIRING) (PILLBOX EXPLODES) Okay.

Why the hell don't you get down in that bloody boat? I'm a doctor, Alex. Maybe we can save you for a Nazi firing squad. Perhaps Rommel won't want to shoot two such devoted stamp collectors as you and me. Here they come. ANNOUNCER: Next to CBS, London, Edward R. Murrow reporting. MURROW: This is London. The battle of Egypt continues to go well. The Axis radio talked of considerable allied naval concentrations in Gibraltar. But the British are a cautious people. Their hopes have been raised before. They prefer to wait and see. But official or authoritative quarters are more confident than they have ever been about any previous action. They don't believe Rommel can get reinforcements in time, and they don't see where he can make a stand without having his flank turned by the superior British force.
