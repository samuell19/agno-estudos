- [Narrator] It is. Beginning. Again. It is beginning again. It is beginning again. The story will be told. But non-believers are doomed. This time, someone might escape before the curse begins again. Before someone else is taken. (clock ticking) (clock bell ringing) The way they look at him. Do they know? (acoustic guitar music) (whistling music) In just a few minutes, or is it an eternity? Brenda and Mark will decide if they now might marry. If the lawyers tell him that his Uncle Callahan left a sizeable estate, two long years must pass before he finishes his residency. Two years of waiting for Brenda. Uncle Callahan is dead. It was called a terrible accident. There was a closed coffin. Only his clothing identified him. (dance music) (dancers clapping) (all shouting) (dancers chattering) - All the way? - All right, here we are. (guests chattering) - [Guest] Pizza. - Somebody take a pizza. - There's two at this table. (all chattering) - These bunch of maniacs don't eat pizza, they inhale it. (acoustic guitar music) (singing in foreign language) - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Hi. - We're separating, so- - Well, head in, John. - I was holding out hope that you'd come too. - No, thank you. - Yeah, but you know, talk to somebody else. - She was giving me the eye, man. - She wasn't giving you the eye. - She was. - No way. - She was. She was giving me the eye, man. No, don't give me that. Hey, look. - Hey. - Hey, hey. - Knock it off. - Come on. - Come on, come on. - Cool it. - Guys, guys, guys. - Hey, hey, come on, come on. Hey, hey, what's going on, huh? Hey. - Let him go, man. - This is supposed to be a party. Come on, relax. It's all right, it's all right. Hey, no, come on. Come on. Take it easy. Come on. Hey, I thought this was supposed to be a party, huh? Come on. Is the excitement over with now? I'm glad everybody's here now. So come on, gather around. I got something to tell you. First, the good part. - The inheritance. Hey, what about it? - [Guests] Yeah. - Did you get a million dollars? - Hold it down, hold it down. My Uncle Callahan left me his ranch. - The ranch? - Now the bad part. - Oh no. - There is a codicil. - What's a codicil? (guests laughing) - It's a condition. - [Man] I got a condition, I really do. - The condition is that I've got to make the ranch pay off and show a good profit within six months or it's not gonna become mine legally. - Aw. - What do you want from us? - Come on. - So, would you all like to go out and see it tomorrow morning? - [Guests] Yeah. - If you can dig it, why don't we all meet here around 11 o'clock in the morning? We'll split and we'll all go out and take a look at it together. - Right on, right on. (guests murmuring) - I know, right? - Then let's go on with the party, come on. (guests cheering) (bright music) - [Narrator] It is like living in the silence between the ticks of a clock for Mark to see all of this again. Remember childhood, innocence, and freedom? Remember it. For it is gone now. If he fails to make the ranch pay, it goes to the caretaker, Solomon, who lives on the land. He is part of the land. Part of everything that happens. Solomon is always here. Yes. You might well say ghost town. But even the spirits have left it to the wind and the rain and the dust. Is there time to even try for repairs? A Saturday and a holiday. A few tourists. But even the curious arrive only rarely. Jim, the justice of the peace, still narrates the Saturday afternoon shows. People have forgotten the murder. That was 1928. A distant eternity for the memory. - Oh, look at the size of that guy. - Too much. He must weight 350 or something like that. - Oh. (bright music) (crowd applauding) - You know, I don't know how in the hell we're gonna make a go of this place, honey. Look at all this property. - Well, I'm sure we can get some revenue or some business from it just by leaving it the way it is. (bright music) - Honey, Uncle Callahan had a hard enough time making taxes made on this joint. - But you know how he is. He had a terrible time with businesses and stuff. - [Narrator] The boys are the sons of the first men who staged the gun fights here. That was before it happened. - [Mark] I don't know, baby, I don't know. There's a lot of problems here. - Well, if we can't think of anything, maybe we should ask the other kids. Maybe they can think of something. - Okay. After the show, then we'll all get together this evening and talk about it, and maybe somebody will come up with something. - [Narrator] Before Uncle Callahan, before Mark, it's all beginning again. - Oh. - Ain't that a blast? (crowd applauding) (bright music) - Do you think these stunt guys would work here for a little, you know, cheaper price? I know Uncle gave 'em, you know, a few dollars every day. But... (dramatic music) Hi there. My name is Mark. I'm the new proprietor here. - Howdy, Mr. Mark. My name's Sandy Ray. - Hi, Sandy. Sandy, this is my fiancee, Brenda. - Howdy, ma'am. - Hey, that was some show you guys put on. - Yeah, we like working here on weekends. - Hey well look, just because I'm taking over the place, there's no sign you have to stop doing your show. - That's not the main thing. We need to keep in shape here. - Well, I can't pay you too much, but I'll do the best I can. - How about I help you get started? - Hey, I'd really appreciate it, Sandy. Hey, why don't you come over and I'll introduce you to the rest of the gang? Groovy. Come on, honey. Hey, hold it down, guys. Say hi to Sandy. He's gonna give us a hand around here. - Oh, hi, how you doing? - How you doing there? - Hi, Sandy. - Looks like we're gonna- - You're on the ranch, now. You're gonna need ranch- - Oh come on, guys. Here we see a real live American cowboy. - Hoo, ha. - We're gonna need some help. - Let's check out this mobile jungle and see if there's anything worthwhile, huh? - All right. (all murmuring) - Let's go, shall we? - Certainly. - Alrighty. (bright music) - [Narrator] Enjoy the sunshine. Relax. Wander about. Soon, it will be night. There will be a moon. A special moon. (door creaking) (Lydia grunting) - [Lydia] No. - Hey, Bob, hey, is that a real covered wagon? - Yes, Stanley, it's a real covered wagon. - Hey, this place is groovy.

It'll probably take about six months, if not longer. - Oh, that's too bad. - Yeah, I know. - I know what I'll do. I'll speak to the gods for you. (Brenda laughing) - Oh, really? - Yes.

It's the time of year when his silver blade slashes in the moonlight. Eight men had planned his death, and eight men were doomed to die in return. Endlessly and aimlessly, he searched the entire west, guided only by the haunted moon. It was in this valley he believed he found the eight. But they were foolishly playing the games of death. Still, the rider saw in them the spirits of his murderers and summoned them with the curse of the Ta Mau. Eight foolish men playing their wars were condemned to reality. (guns firing) (man grunting) In the manner of their prepense. Forevermore, those who played the roles of violence are safe in this valley only if they leave before the Ta Mau Moon. Staying, you will be marked by the rider to serve his unending need for revenge. - And revenge is mine, sayeth the Lord. - Amen, brother. - Amen to you too, brother. - Hey, what do you think of the old man's ghost stories, huh? It was inspiring he could even think of anything, watching him and everything. - Come on now. - Come on what? - As a fact, in the early 20s, someone put a real bullet in their gun. - What happened? - Seven people got killed. - Oh god. - Wow, man. Hey, what do you guys think about moving out there, you know- - No, I think it's great. I think it's great for Mark and- - Really. - Oh no. - Really. - Wishing. I'm wishing. - Well, honey, I hope we're not all just wishing. - Oh no, there's a lot here to work with, honey. We can do a lot with this place. - I hope so. Let's go make sure all the gang is bedded down, okay? - Okay. - Hey, John. - Yeah? - I'm sorry about earlier. Well, it's just that there you were and there we were. And there she was. And, well, I'm just sorry. - What do you mean sorry, man? She dug it. (all chuckling) - [Narrator] How innocently he chooses the silence of the moonlight. (hooves clopping) - What is it?

There was some guy outside running around on a horse. - A horse? - He almost ran me over and he threw this all over me. - A horse, of course. - You guys don't believe me, do you? - No. - No. - Where is Mark? I wanna talk to him. - Forget Mark. He's in love. - You gotta watch this, buddy. He thinks he can figure us. - It's probably some nut from around here overplaying a bad joke.

I've got to make a report on this. - You can't do that. - Look, it's the law. You've gotta make a report on any gunshot wound no matter how you get it. - Mark. The kids. Everybody. They put their hearts into this thing for you. They're raring to go. I mean, it's a place to live. - Well, what does that have to do about filing a report? - Plenty. What if the papers get the story? - Well, that's what everybody's been complaining about around here. They want more publicity. - That kind of publicity we can do without. - Why? - What do you mean why? A real bullet gets put in one of the guns that is fired. Would you bring your wife and kids to a place that let that happen? - You've got a point there. - You can't file the report. - But it's the law. I've gotta file a report about any gunshot wounds. - Okay, it wasn't a gunshot. - Well, what was it, a low-flying jet or something? - Look, Sandy told us we should always aim to miss. The wad from the blank fired out of the cartridge. That's what it was. That's what I got. - Is that right? - You can't file the report. You can't do it. - Well, if everybody plays it cool and goes along with it, yeah, yeah, okay, it was an accident. - Accident. I don't know, man. That old man and that spooky story last night and that nut running around. I just wonder. - How is he? - I don't know. He looks all right.

It was just a slight accident. - Accident? - Well, how did the real bullet get in the gun anyway? - I don't know, man. It was in the storeroom with the rest of them. - Hey, I saw the old man hanging around there. - Solomon? - Yeah. - Bob, let's go have a talk with Solomon. - Yeah, let's go do that little thing. - That's a little more Wild West than I bargained for. - No kidding. (eerie music) - Hey, Solomon, we wanna talk to you. - What about? - Someone put a live shell in one of the guns. You wouldn't know anything about that, now would you? Well? It's just like it was in that story of yours. - Come on, you old creep, somebody could've been killed, and it could've been my brother or me. (eerie music) - Today was the first day. The Ta Mau Moon. - [Tom] Don't start that superstition stuff again. - That was a real bullet and a guy is hurt. - Tomorrow. And tomorrow is the second day. - Come on, this old guy's nuts. - All right. - Go ahead. Go ahead and play your games and prance and strut. For your tourists. (eerie music) - [Narrator] The curious no longer come to see Solomon's land. Solomon, who is part of everything, remembers. But the curious have forgotten. - Hey, everybody. There's tourists. Rich tourists. - Wa-hoo, wow. - Tourists, hey. - Hey, everybody. (bell ringing) Tourists. - Our recreational facilities are at your disposal, madam. Please pleasure yourselves accordingly. - What a lovely, lovely place you have. It seems so relaxing and it's just so beautiful. It looks like paradise, doesn't it? - Yes, it's very nice here. - You're too kind. Would you care to tour our facilities? - Yes, I would love to see every inch of the land. - Come. - What a sweet and durable place. It's very magical. Have you any lucky animals? - Not to my knowledge. However, it is said that those who pass through these portals return with a greater fortune. - May I look around? - Please do. - [Rich Woman] Yes, Beckie told me about him, Roger. - Yes, he was a country philosopher. He came from Oklahoma. He was a spokesman of political satire. - You know, I am really mad about this. There's plenty of acreage. This is a sauna house. - Well, the Klondike pioneers would've been very happy if it were. - Oh, this place is just so (speaking in foreign language). (speaking in foreign language) It reminds me of Pompeii. It has the same fabled character. Yes, I'd like to see the owner. - Of course. Might I ask your name? - Baron Isabelle Collin Dufresne. - I'll send him right in. - Darling, come and sit here. Well here, we can be happy. Romantic. Erotic. This place is for us. - I'm glad you like it here. - It's just heaven. - It is. It is nice. - Oh, it's better than nice. I'll turn it into paradise. - It's quite a lot of work, you know? - No, you know I'm magical. You know I drink blood for br- - Baroness, this is the owner, Mark Callahan, his fiancee, Brenda. Kids, this is the Baroness- - Isabelle Collin Dufresne. (speaking in foreign language) - How do you do, Baroness? How may I help you? - I love you property, and I would like to buy it. - Well, I really haven't thought about selling it. - Just name the price. Any price. - Well, it's not exactly a question of money. You see, my uncle left this place to me in his will on the stipulation that I prove to the executors of the estate that I can make it a paying proposition within six months. - You mean you don't own it? - Well, not exactly. (Isabelle screaming) - What is that? - That's Solomon. He's our night caretaker. He's all right. - Oh. Darling, I think we should go, please. - Come back and see us, Baroness. (piano music) - What? - Oh, that French broad, she's too much. - She's quite a character, isn't she? - Takes all kinds, honey. She is the richest burlesque queen in the world. - You know, she is. - Hm? - You read about her all the time. She's worth millions. - Are you serious? - You know, that's what I was thinking. We've really placed our bets, haven't we? - How do you mean, honey? - Well, maybe she could've advanced us enough to satisfy the lawyers. And we could've sold the place to her. - No. No, I couldn't do that. - Well, we had our chance, and we blew it. We made our bed, so I guess we'll have to- - Yes, dear, you were saying? (piano music) (Mark laughing) Oh, great. - One tourist all day and she doesn't want to stay for the show. - Lord love a duck, what a beginning. - Well, if I may be so bold, my comrades, I happen to know of a quaint little pub located not far down the road where we may unparch our thirst. - Yeah, I'll drink to that. Maybe we can bring somebody back to- - Oh hold it, loves. If we go, we'll leave the place deserted. Now come on. - Look about you, pumpkin. The place is deserted. (speaking in foreign language) - Wait for me. (harmonica music) (plane whirring) (wind howling) (folksy music) - It's gold. Hey. (folksy music) Uh-uh. Hey. No, man, this is mine. Yeah, mine, baby. - Not mine, honey, ours. - Oh, Mark, do you mean it? - You know I do. We're gonna make this place go. It's shaping up already. And just as soon as we do, we're getting married at that little church right back there, and make everything legal and beautiful. - Oh, here? - It's okay? - Oh. - I love you, Brenda. - I love you. (insects chirping) (wolf howling) - [John] Hey, Mark. Hey come here a minute, will you? - Yeah, John? - Hey, listen. I came into some bread, man. And I think I can take this dog off your hands, baby. I mean, after all, what's a doctor what with a junk place like this, man? - Hey, John, I don't even own it yet. - Listen, man, I can get some bread and take this right off your hands, and you can go on with your... What's that, man? - Look, I got six months to go before this is legally mine. Why don't you talk to me about it then, John? Really. I'm busy right now. - Hey listen, Mark. Hey, baby.

He ran through darkness in the special moonlight. It was all happening again. (woman sobbing) - Where is Mark? He probably could've saved her. - It wouldn't have done any good. She was smashed up bad. You know, something really scared her. She was running around like she was crazy. And she had blood smeared all over her face. And then, she just ran right in front of that truck. I couldn't stop her. - [Man] Blood all over her? The same thing happened to Randy. - It looks like murder. - I still think that old man is up to something. - All right now, is everybody here? - [Stanley] Where's John? - He's all right. He's with Lydia. They'll be here in a minute. - Okay, now listen up, gang. I've gotta go downtown and file a report on this. I want you all to stay here and stay close together. Don't go out wandering around outside anywhere. You got it? I'll be back as soon as I can. - Mark, let me go with you. - No, honey, you stay here, please. - [Narrator] Watch everyone, Mark. Everyone. You must watch everyone, for it is beginning again. - Come on. Come on. What? - Mark doesn't want us to wander away anyplace. - Mark's not here, come on. - No. - Come on, I got something to show you. Come on. (both grunting) (percussive music) - [Lydia] No. (percussive music) Oh. (horse neighing) (ominous music) (hooves clopping) (fence clacking) (hooves clopping) (fence clacking) (Lydia moaning) (distorted music) (hooves clopping) (distorted music) (hooves clopping) (distorted music) (hooves clopping) (distorted music) (hooves clopping) (distorted music) (blood whooshing) (Headless Horseman laughing) (distorted music) (hooves clopping) - [Narrator] Try as he did to save her life, he could only fail. She spoke of strange things. Of visions and horrors she had seen. But they thought them only nightmares. Now, she sleeps forever. (eerie music) (soft music) (clock ticking) - Watch them running around down there. Do you see 'em, Sandy? Watch them sway and play in the dream. Shooting each other with their toy pistols. Bleeding toy blood. While the moon stays up, they keep running around having fun. Pretty soon, there won't even be nobody left. Won't even be nobody to say bang, bang. You're dead. (Solomon laughing) - Boy, it sure isn't a game anymore. - Look at the old geezer just sitting up there glaring at us, Stan. - I think he wants to get rid of us. - Yeah, it's a super generation gap. - Yeah but, you know what, Tom and Bob watched him all night and he never left his shack. - Oh yeah, well what does that mean? He could've had one of his old friends do it for him. Maybe the Indian with the whip maybe. - It could've been any of those old-timers, man. For all we know, they may all be in on this. - Wow, you really know how to ease the tension around here, don't you? - Hey, somebody has to take inventory or something. - Oh come on. - Yeah, some of the kids already left. Besides, who do we have to shoot the thing? Hey, where's John? - Listen, that was his chick. - Oh, I didn't even think. - The last time I saw him, he was up walking around the hills looking like a lost dog. Kind of blames himself. He was the one that gave her the acid. - Yeah, I know. - So, we'll forget about the errands for the night and take up positions around here and keep an eye out for whoever or whatever that thing is out there, okay? - Yeah, you're right. - All right, we've all agreed then. We're gonna stay out here all night until we catch this character. One man's been shot. An accident maybe, I don't know. But he did cause a girl to die, and we're gonna get him. Sandy, you stay up there. Lucky, you get in the wagon. And you'll be in the Indian hut. - Got it. - And please try to stay awake. Bob, you come with me. (insects chirping) You guys all set? - We're ready. - Okay, you go up there by the saloon. You get up there on the hill. Joe, you go around there by the fence. And you go with him and make sure he doesn't go to sleep. Follow me, Bob. (whistling music) (insects chirping) (hooves clopping) - [Headless Horseman] Dare play the game here? Under the Ta Mau Moon? - Now get down off that horse. (whip cracking) Stay right there. Hold it. Would you look at this? Look at what we got here, kiddies. Do you like the place? Don't move. Just try to stay still. Now, take this off. Get it off. Good old Johnny, huh? Artie, go call the police. Tom, see if you can find a place where we can keep him. And, Bob, see if you can tell the girls about it, huh? We got the Headless Horseman. - That was it, man. Who cares? Turn around, idiot. (tense music) You know, man, it was you that made my baby trip out on that acid. It was you, wasn't it, huh? I'll cut your throat. (John grunting) (whip cracking) (Solomon screaming) (John panting) (whip cracking) (John grunting) (whip cracking) (John grunting) - Get him! - Get him, he's getting away. - Get him. - Let's get him. (John panting) (John grunting) - Get off! - Get him. (fists thudding) - [Tom] Pick him up. Drag him back down. - Yeah, you're gonna be all right, man. No concussion. Just take a couple of aspirin and get some sleep tonight. - That stuff better do some good. - Hey, how'd you all get into that scuffle out there? - I was holding a gun on him, man. I got too close, and oh. Grabbed it, got it, pow. - No, man, on the floor. - On the floor. - On the floor! And you better stay there, 'cause I owe you one, baby. - [John] All right, all right. - Good lord, what are you doing? What is happening now? - We found him, our Headless Horseman. - John? - What the devil? - It wasn't me. It was that crazy old caretaker dude. He got my chick ripped off on acid. He's going around killing all these people. He's running around in the hills at night spooking people with his head off, man. And you know why? Because there's gold here. - Gold, here? - You're so full of it. - There's gold, I'm telling you. I found it. - John, he tells that all the time, man. It's been attracting a lot of tourists around here. - Mark, I saw. I found it. - Well, there were some locations of some pretty rich gold ore deposits in this area. - That's because they used to salt this property and sell it to the people from back east that didn't know any better. - Mark, I'm sharper than that. I'm telling you, it's real gold, man. - I don't understand any of you. People have been hurt. People have been killed. And the police are on their way. And you're talking about gold. - Gold. Oh, Mark, wouldn't it be great if we could find gold? - And diamonds and emeralds and pearls. - Oh, and then if we're rich, well, then the lawyers will be happy. - No such luck, honey. - Well, why not? If we find gold, then that proves the place is a success. - Yeah, you'd think so, but I'm afraid the attorneys interpret it just a little bit differently. It states in my uncle's will that this place must make a profit as a tourist attraction. There's nothing in it about mineral rights. Hey, how would you like to go to town with me tomorrow? - Where to, darling? - The courthouse. - About John? - No, to see about a license I need. Now, honey, I know this sounds morbid to you, but now that John's been arrested and we've finally seen an end to all this, this place is gonna be front headlines. It's gonna draw a whole flock of tourists. You know, the kind that want to see where the body was laid at and how the guy was killed. - I know, I know, how awful. - I know it's awful, but it's true. And that would mean that we've made it, honey. And then we can finally get that marriage license. - Oh, Mark. Do you mean it? - Now would I kid a nice kid like you? (birds chirping) - Get ready. Here they come. Of course, I'm the best man ever had to stand outside a church for a wedding. - Thank you, Reverend. Thank you. (pleasant music) (guests cheering) (dog barking) - [Tom] I'm sure glad Mark and Brenda got back. - [Sandy] Yeah, wait for a couple hours, man, when this place starts filling up with tourists. Watch 'em flip. - We ought to tell 'em about that cooky old rich lady that came back. - The one that wanted us to do a show re-enacting the murders up there? - Yeah, that's the one. - Oh, the valley, it is a paradise of the macabre. - On second thought, maybe we ought not to tell them. - Hey, where are them old married couple anyway? - Well, Brenda's out back somewhere and Mark's off talking to Randy. - They want me to testify. - Well, you had to expect that. - Yeah, I know, but I can't testify against a buddy. I mean, John's a really weird dude and all that, but I've never known him to deliberately hurt anyone. - I know, Randy, but they caught him in that horseman outfit. - They did, but he says he found the horse wandering around in the hills. And you gotta believe that 'cause, well, where else would John get a horse? - John's got all sorts of connections, man. You know that. What about when he thought he found the gold here? He tried to buy the place from me. - Oh yeah? Well, anyways, I just gotta say I recognize the horse, but I can't say it was John. - And you can't say that it wasn't. - Look, Doc, what am I gonna do? I don't wanna be the one to hang him. - Of course you don't, man, but there's only one thing you can do. You've got to answer all of their questions. You've got to. (tense music) (clock ticking) - The thing that bothers me. The first night we saw the horseman, well, Randy saw him, remember? - Yeah, I remember. - Well, John was bedded down with us that night. So it couldn't be him. - That's right. And remember what John said about there being gold here? - Yeah. - Well, just suppose there really was gold on this property. And that would give someone a very good reason to do almost anything to get his hands on it, wouldn't it? - Like publicity. Like Mark was saying the other day about all the curiosity-seekers or the morbid types that'll be pouring into this place on weekends. - And they have. You know, something's very wrong here. - Yeah. You know, when all the others were found, they had blood splattered on them. But when John was caught, there was no blood. - But hang on, let's figure all the angles first, and then we'll check with Mark, all right? - Yeah. Come on, Tom. (tense music) - Hi, Mark. - Hi, Sandy. - I just wanted to check with you. I'm going up in the canyon to check for rattlesnakes. - Okay, okay, good, good. Hey, let me take a look at that six-shooter. - No, it's loaded for snakes, Mark. - Loaded? Okay. - [Tom] Hey, Mark, we wanna talk to you. - Yeah. - The night Lydia was killed, you took off and left us in that old saloon. Where did you go? - Well, I told you, I went with the authorities into town. - I called to talk to you. You were never there. - Well, I didn't exactly go all the way into town with them. - Then what about the night Randy saw the horseman? He was looking all over for you to tell you about it. You never did explain where you were at that time. - It sounds like you all are saying that- - We just want to know, man. - What about this business about the gold? You told us you grew up here. If there were any gold around here, you'd probably know about it. - Gold here? Hey, whoever heard of gold in Southern California? - The United States Assay Office. 85% of the gold deposits discovered here are still under the ground. - The night Lydia was run over, there was a lot of excitement around here. People yelling, running around, looking for you, Mark. Thinking she might still be alive. Thinking you might be able to help. It was at least 15 minutes before you showed up. Now, where were you? - Now I told you- - No, you didn't tell us. - Now, wait a minute. It sounds like you're trying to accuse me. - Should we? - No. Now just cut it out, man, before I do get mad. You know, I don't have to put up with any of you bums around here. - Oh, is that what we are? - Well, just stay out of my way, okay? - Are we in your way, Mark? How are we in your way? - Stop it. - Stop what? - Just cut it out and get out of here. - Mark, all of these people have been splattered with real blood. Now who but a doctor would have access to so much blood? - Now give us some answers, Mark. - Okay. Okay, yeah, there is gold around here. There's a lot of gold around here. I found it when I was a kid. And I've been waiting. Waiting a long time for that old man to die. Watching all those old cronies hanging around here. You know some of them used to be prospectors? I was always waiting. Worrying if whether they would find my gold before the old man kicked off. - Oh, Mark. Three people are dead. Why? - I had to have this place. I went through hell waiting for that old man to die. - By killing people? - I didn't mean to kill 'em. They were all just accidents, man. It happened that way. - They were killed, Mark. They were killed. - It wasn't supposed to happen that way. They were just accidents. - I'm going to the police. - No, stop. Hey. I said stop. (gun firing) Leave me alone! - Mark! - I gotta get another gun. - He killed my brother. I'll get mine with no blanks. (tense music) (gun firing) (tense music) - Oh, Bob. What happened? Another accident? - It's Mark. He shot him. He's gone mad. - Mark? Mark? - No. (gun firing) Don't go out there. - No. (tense music) No! Mark! - Please, don't. Come on. - No, leave me alone. Let me go. Mark. - You gotta believe us. We want to help you. (tense music) (Brenda screaming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - What's the matter with him? - Get down. - What's the matter with him? (gun firing) (tense music) Mark. It's Stanley, Mark. We're your friends. I'm your friend. Mark. Put down the gun. (Stanley sobbing) Give me the gun, Mark. Everything's gonna be all right. If you just give me the- (gun firing) He killed me. (guns firing) (clock bell ringing) (clock ticking) - [Narrator] It may now begin again. Mark will ride with the horseman, and the curse will begin again, when next the Ta Mau Moon rises. They will speak of this as a ghost town that is offered for sale. The curious will come to see where it all happened, and there is a buyer anxious to greet the paying customers. He will walk in the moonlight. It will begin again. (horse neighing) It will begin again. (Headless Horseman laughing) It will begin again. It will begin again. It will begin again. It will begin again. (Headless Horseman laughing) (pleasant music)
