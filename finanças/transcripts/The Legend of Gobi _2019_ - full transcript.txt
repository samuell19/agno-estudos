They say that a generous heart is like a melody For a long time, people from the musical tribe became kings. And now they were living under king Enkhjin's rule. The sun would rise in the east like it always has And people still believed in myths People worshipped the musicians and respected the melody. And they were enjoying an abundance of happiness. But on one cloudy day, the blood moon changed everything Only a person from the musical tribe became king. But someone decided to lead a rebellion against that tradition The leader of the rebellion was a hand of the king called Egler. He was cruel and blood hungry. He rallied every soldier he could find Execute everyone that played music! Execute everyone that doesn't obey me! Burn them all! Burn! From now on there is no more music! I am The King!

It can be tomorrow, just help me get out of here You can come see your horse any time you like It doesn't have to be today. It can be tomorrow, just help me get out of here This is King Egler's country. He is the king that stopped music. We only have one law here. Obey him. If you try to leave you will be killed. Here only King Egler and Queen Esergen have power Queen Esergen? Yes Forgive me my queen. From today I will learn everything you teach me I thought you were a tough girl What happened? I will be drinking your water now, I wanted to obey the rules as well Then listen, fortunate but unlucky women get chosen to be queens. Be cold like ice and flexible like a cloud Now you will have to be King Egler's queen. But there won't be a wedding. He will be kneeling before you in no time My queen. Even though my parents are gone I still have a home to get to. Please forgive- First listen to me. King Egler believes you were put on this earth to bear his child Why my queen? When I was younger than you King Egler took my virginity forcefully. And I lost the ability to bear a child. Ever since then he has been looking for another beauty So you're gonna train me to take your revenge? Don't be so short sighted. I've been by his side for 20 years. And I've never seen him be this pleasant When a person is happy they are the most vulnerable. As long as he lives this world can't be peaceful. Not just you I'm warning you, don't be seduced by him As long as he lives the world can't be peaceful. Not just you Seems like the wedding will be beautiful Who is King Egler? Why are you scared? Hush. He's a cruel man that committed genocide against the musical tribe. Don't ask again I'll try my best Practice your archery tomorrow I can smell the blood from here. I can never have a peaceful moment here. Even if the sun rose everyday, my heart is still breaking. I can't take this anymore. I can't take this anymore What just happened? Leave me alone! A don't want to see you or listen to you No one goes against their fate. You have to be my queen I'd rather die than lay with my enemy and continue his bloodline I'll forget that I'm a king for a moment. I''ll do anything for you, just don't ask me to kill you Please let me go, I'm begging you. You're really not gonna let me go? If you can't let me go then I'll show you what I'm made of Our plan worked. King Egler was left at the altar Princess Egeerel really walked out in the middle of the wedding? I'm sure he's upset. Please tell me what to do now? We're very lucky because he's affectionate towards her. But we have to hurry You said you trained her, she doesn't want to carry my child. She hates me You have to heal her pain. Remind her of her parents, her home Once a woman's heart is moved, she will become soft and vulnerable You have to move her heart with music Once a woman's heart is moved, she will become soft and vulnerable You have to move her heart with music What? You want to play with my life now? You have to risk your life if you want a child You have to risk your life if you want a child My Khelen Khar I got you this A bow has eyes of its own Mom! I'm flying! Look! The king let you listen to music? Yes my queen. Music is so beautiful. This cold castle seemed to warm up because of the music. And I thought King Egler was a cruel person but he doesn't seem so bad now... And all of a sudden I was sitting right next to King Egler! I can't believe I trusted someone like you. I'm so stupid Why my queen? I walked out of the wedding and I made him play music like you instructed And I just realized you're his now! Music makes a person forget their hatred Tell me, what do I have to do? You wanted to kill King Egler, but you didn't succeed That's because the king has a spare life that can't be taken with a knife or a bow and arrow You have to take his spare life Here Kill the musician Get up! You're the only person that got that close to King Egler's life My queen forgive me, I got too into the music- I'll remind you one thing Ask the king to play the music again, I'll find a way to separate him from the musician I didn't think I'd see the day you looked this calm. It's nice seeing you like this You helped me solve this, thank you my queen Then soon you will enjoy your queen and have a child There was a time where I was too eager. I carry that pain in my heart. And you paid the price You don't hide that pain from me. Because you tell me about your pain I started to resent you. But from now on I will try my best to be more kind towards you I take it the music reached the princess's heart? I suggest you prepare a gift for her Show her that you're her man forever. If you do that your pain will go away and you will win that young woman's love Where does the music come from? You really don't know? Your law states that we can't even look at a musician. I am one of thousands that didn't grow up without a lullaby because of that Please keep playing. I can only get away from this place by killing myself To feel the wind, to look at a river, to look at the night sky. You have to stay alive to feel all of that in your heart No no. Ever since I started listening to your music, I started to warm up to King Egler. But he's my enemy that destroyed my home. He's the king that stopped music! I can't endure a life with him I wanted to die too. But I endured it by telling myself that there must be a way out of this place I waited 20 years waiting King Egler to die. Now my struggle is about to be over My queen no! Wait! If we kill the musician the king will die. Didn't you want that? Yes I wanted that. I still want it. If we kill the musician, music is gone forever. Won't that make us the same as the king? You couldn't kill the musician. You can't even let him be killed! My queen, forgive me I spent 20 years in this palace. I know every corner. Even prepared my exit strategy. You can use that now Keep walking, in the end there will be someone named Burii waiting for you. He's a good person struggling to keep music alive Thank you my queen. What about you? I almost destroyed music, you stopped me. Burii will help you guys live on. Musician, please keep playing your music My queen, thank you for your kindness Now go, the horses are ready. Burii is ready for you, go go! What the hell are you doing here? I wanted to know how you would treat me after this I know you wanted to kill me everyday. But that will get you killed, not me Don't miss them! I am the only one left from the musical tribe. Musical gods please take away the pain. [Reciting poem] I didn't know you were that good of an archer Thanks to my dad, he would say a bow and arrow had eyes of their own But I can't compare my skills to your musical skills Eyes huh? My dad used to say the instrument had a soul of its own I would see my parents every time I heard your music A person can practice archery. Can anyone learn an instrument? No, the instrument's soul is only born with the musician Oh no! The wildlings! Hurry! Khelen Khar! I'm gonna catch you! My poor horse, we grew up together. I loved him like family Fucking wildlings! Kill them! Sir! That's the place Queen Esergen told us to find They say that King Egler created this era of no love He committed genocide against the musical tribe. He wanted to be king. He rallied his soldiers and killed every musician that protected their music My father was able to rescue his family and a several others My family escaped too and lived in the mountains ever since One night we were found by a group of soldiers. Egler wanted my sister to be his queen. My father hid her but Egler found her then took her life Egler kept killing and killing. My father summoned all of his energy to beg god. He wanted me to stay alive so he connected Egler's soul to mine So my father was sentenced to be in prison with me. And I became the only one left from the musical tribe My late father had a psychic ability. He got visions when he played his instrument. I guess I got that ability from him I had a vision. A beautiful princess named Egeerel saving me from the king. Our fates were connected. Now get some sleep Beautiful flowers, rainbows. Horses running. I would have all kinds of beautiful dreams. Hope you have them too tonight Khelen Khar! (the horse's name) Wow! You made a beautiful instrument! Hope this always reminds you of your Khelen Khar I keep having visions of my death If you die the musical bloodline will be extinct Yes. It will be extinct. The instrument's soul is born with the musician Bring her to me Yumla! Take care of my soul My king, what's the hurry? I got what I wanted, I don't want to kill time here I got what I wanted too, I am eager to get to my palace But I wanted to rest a bit here Your precious soul? I can rest easy now that you're dead and I will feed the musician to the birds Announce that king Yumla is here! No need to resist princess. Take your seat I didn't know you were this slimy If it weren't me, someone else would've killed King Egler. I rescued you from him You need to thank me I am upset that I'm going from one enemy to another! No need to be upset. Queen Esergen wanted to kill the king. So I found you Your fate has changed. Now sit on your throne. I will make you happy I promised you I will let you be. But my patience has a limit. Until it reaches that limit, wander around Don't forget what happened to King Egler because he banned music I am not King Egler! And you have no right to lecture me! Once that bastard of yours is born, I will kill them! And you will be mine forever Forgive us my king Where am I? You are in a village that managed to hide music Who are you? Yumla used to fight for you. I was unlucky, my eye got caught in your arrow. Think about it, we are not the only ones hiding in the mountains to save our music There are many of us scattered around. Only a real king can unite us. Yumla promised us he could revive our tribe. We trusted him but he only betrayed us. You once destroyed our tribe but I believe you can revive it. That's why I couldn't let you die My king, Princess Egeerel is coming He's supposed to be dead. And how did he come inside? Hurry princess Princess! You fed the musician to the birds but I think you couldn't stop their bloodline What? So I've been protecting my enemy's life by keeping it close to me? Yes my king. King Egler's soul is in Princess Egeerel's belly. He's trying to save his life What will you do now? What? You slimy fucker, are you mocking me? I will kill Princess Egeerel! I will kill her just like this. Then King Egler will die and I will be king I will gather my soldiers Get ready! Don't miss! Get more soldiers in there, I have to feed Princess Egeerel to the birds What are you still doing here? Hurry! Take your kids Burii! Leave now! Save your music. I have your back. The musical bloodline is in Princess Egeerel's womb Those who play music are sentenced to die Get out of my way! The princess is there, find her! Egler, keep him there! My arrows always hit their target I know where to shoot now Every time you bleed, gets me closer to the throne We shouldn't hurt regular people for the throne! Why didn't you realize that earlier?? Didn't you realize you were torturing people when you took away music? Now I will rule over those people! You started this. I am the king now. King! Egeerel, forgive me. You were born to light up this world. I took that light away. I took your melody away. Stay alive. I will do anything An instrument's soul is born with the musician. Save the musician's bloodline An instrument's soul was just born with the musician. The musical god is back From then on music was born again and Mongolians respected and cherished the Morin Khuur (Horsehead Fiddle) for generations to come.
