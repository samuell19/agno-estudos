The wheels start turning again Thom: and the industry starts moving again. Thom: This time they get more terrifying. It just keeps going on... basically outside of our control. ***barcelona. backstage, before the concert Thom: Lucky is actually wildly appropriate - 'we are standing on the edge?. Colin and Ed: Lets do 'Lucky' then. ***'fitter happier' playing in the background. ***barcelona.'lucky' Q: I want to know if you are aware of the fact... that this album is going to be a... a classic? Q: The album is called 'OK Computer'... but there is no any song called 'OK Computer'. Q: What is music to you? What is music to you? Band: To us? Q: To you. Q: Are you related in some way to the britpop scene? Q: Is there anything you'd want to do that you haven't done? Thom: Oh, Lord! Q: What did you wanted to achieve... when you started the band? What was your aim? Q: How would you define rock music? Q: Do you think there is more influence from Genesis or Pink Floyd... Band: No. We all hate progressive rock music. Q: Your record... this record is incredible. Q: One might say, 'a lunatic crazy act of desperate men'. Ed: Not just a soundscape, but really a dreamscape. Q: Dreamscape? Ed: Yeah. Q: Interesting. Thom: Personally, I had the sound in my head. The sound of big glass shopping malls. Thom: Lots of glass and chrome and white and stuff. Q: I think of it as a kind of mantra? Ed: It's kind of... white and shiny. Q: What is? Ed: The record... it's kind of white and shiny. Yes... Thom: I had a reason for it a couple of days ago... which is the best one yet. Which was a... The 'OK Computer' is about everything being out of control. Colin: Thank you very much for coming to talk to us and ask questions. ***glastonbury Thom: Andy, can you turn on the lights so we could see the people... 'cause we haven't seen them yet.

Girl: And then... that's it until the optional photo-shoot at three o?clock. ***Thom and Jonny are interviewed by Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly. Q: if you're not the saviors of rock, what are you? Thom: Clueless. Q: What it seems.. it seems that you're kind of... Thom: For this kind of tabloid-literate generation (?), every move you make has already been done taken a piss out of. Q: A lot is being made right now in the American press... that all these celebs, actors, you know, coming up to your gigs. Q: Does that have any impact on you at all? Thom: We are from England and the English people are not impressed. Thom: There's an automatic assumption that with any degree of success, it automatically brings with it that you've cheated in some way Thom: or that you're full of shit or whatever. Thom: So we have an inherent distrust of... I mean this is... Thom: It's an absolute fascination to us that... celebrities in America just live on a higher plank. Thom: They are untouchable. It's fucking mad, it's really insane. Q: Yeah, so it doesn't impress you that? whoever?... that Tom Cruise or whoever might show up to one of your gigs? Thom: Well, you say hello to him, you know? Thom: And go home and tell your friends and say 'Ha, I met Tom Cruise, yeah' Q: Have you had any conversations with any of these celebs? Thom: Yeah, I had a great conversation with Calvin Klein about underwear. Q: Last night? Thom: Maybe. Q: I understand that he was at the show last night. Thom: I didn't talk to him. But you can put that in if you want. Q: I understand that you've been told that John Oates... was at the show, of ?Hall and Oates? fame, Michael Mist and Wyatt Franz? Thom: Mr. Wyatt Franz? Mr. Jacques Strap... Q: Lenny Kravitz also see it's tough to have somebody you want just... have to open it for you if you're out there ***new york ***'how to disappear completely' Thom: it's very basic? Michael: Welcome, guys, it's Michael downstairs. Michael: Good to see you. All: Hi mike Thom:... 20 minutes, for her spinning away and we don't get 5 minutes... to plug the fucking guitar in, is that why? Man: I dont' know why Thom: Just making sure, you know. ***'karma police' Thom: There's a guy on the stage giving us shit Girl: who... who has? look, I was sitting sort of off from that on your shot Thom: the guy that was with you and Mike... Girl: oh, Thom: loads of shit, and my friend's like... fuck! ***'meeting in the aisle' Thom: It's funny because we had this conversation on the bus... a few days ago, the five of us? Thom: Talking about how the freakiest thing about all of this to the... newbie is the idea that you would be like one of those bands to somebody. Thom: I just remember, like, listening to Strange Ways, the Smiths, ...and this girl, in the room I used to stay at in Oxford, she brought an album that came out and stuff In the same time it's like REM's 'Dead Letter Office', the whole album... You know that thing of it being imprinted on... your heart, you know, every now and then... Thom: So I think every time I meet someone who?s, like, that age, that comes to one of our shows, it?s such a big deal for me, because I can remember how much of a big deal it was? you know, I never met, at the time, but I know how much of a big deal it is, cos I?ve been the same, you know. And everything else is bullshit, you know. Thom: Its the reason to keep going. That in itself is the reason to keep going. The idea that you form the part, the most crucial part of someone's... life, in the nasty teenage bit, where everything goes completely wrong. Girl: Yeah, yeah, just around the corner, wherever, stop. Thom: can i get a receipt for that? 1: There's a guy here... 1:... you hear anything about Radiohead? 1: What? A party for Radiohead? 1: Sorry, I don't want to put you out. Girl: Ok, let's go. 1: That's pretty funny man. 2: Oh, wow! Shit! Dude, write a song about it! Come on man write it right now!

Colin: Right. Interesting. Q: I was pretty much split between the rights as well? Colin:Right Q: Do you feel famous? Colin: No. It's great? It would be terrible. Colin: Increasingly, actually, and Thom gets that, obviously. And Jonny does more now, you know, but I don?t think... Q: How do you cope with that? Colin: I don't have to. So, it's not a problem. Colin: But I wouldn't like to... going to... be whisked up when you are in the middle... of like one of the cool parts of berlin and you start hanging out, which is a shame, but, you know, it's not what we are here for. But I've had a good company here anyway... "What's it been like?? -- 'I don't know, I don't have the slightest idea'. I don't know. I hate it. I used to really like doing this piece, but i really hate it now. I don't hate it, i just, like, get really incoherent. Sorry, Ted. Q: I'm sorry about it. Colin: No, I'm sorry. I don't hate it, it's not true. I was talking to Thom about this, actually. We did... this interview with John after the set the other day and I was saying, I asked Thom how it was,.. Thom... is like, yeah, it was good, it was, it was fine. John had, like, all these questions, and they were really good... questions, it was just fine, but absolutely nothing to say. Colin: All of us except Thom, we'd be doing up to like 3 interviews a day. Colin: Completely talked out. Colin: I just feel like Mr. Vacuum Brained Bimbo at the moment. Colin: I'm sure I've been much more lucid. Q: What are you taking the spotlight for? Colin: haircut, headaches... What? Q: Why are you taking the spotlight? Colin: No, each and every one of us does as much of it as he wants to... Colin: So, like Jonny doesn't do any TV-interviews Colin: that stuff, because he thinks he comes across as an idiot, so... Colin: What else is there? That's about it, really... Q: Okay. Cheers. Colin: Sorry, mate? Q: That's all right It wasn't that bad, i don't know, you seem very... Colin: Oh, I'm just tired. Ed: Yeah, great, just make another record. Q: Oh yeah. ***'Life in a Glass House' ***'Exit Music' 41:18 Announcer: Radiohead are also nominated... for 'the best album' award, "OK Computer" Announcer: and I when I spoke to Colin from Radiohead earlier he said that... despite all the accolades that they've had heaped on them the last year, that he still thought it was quite an honour to be nominated Colin: I'm very flattered I suppose would be the right word.. Announcer: What do you feel your chances are? Colin: Incredibly minimal to slight hardly any at all, Colin: but the record company very kindly laid on a Lear Jet... so that in the middle of our tour we just came from Berlin Colin: and we've never been on any of these before, so... Announcer: You're kidding! Colin: No, it's very exciting! Announcer: One of the most prestigeous awards for 'the best... album' and the nominees are the Radiohead's "OK Computer", Announcer: Prodigy "Fat of the Land", Oasis... "Be Here Now", Fun Lovin' Criminals... "Come Find Yourself", Texas "White on Blonde", and Sheryl Crow "Sheryl Crow". Announcer: it could turn out to be kind of dispelling... the myth that Radiohead don't ever go to parties. Announcer: The London social world, they turned out there on a Lear Jet, no less. Host: The winner of 'the best album' is the one and only Radiohead. 1:: Well we knew we'd won. 2: Oh yeah, we wouldn't have come otherwise. Man: Well, I had a good time, yeah. I think Colin found it all a bit strange, actually. Man: Colin probably enjoyed himself, though... he pretended not to... cos Colin's... like... its just a day of bizzare, sort of.. bizarre occurrences.... the final?

Host2: You know, the the critics love Radiohead. Host: I think that they are all right but it is a bit, you know... Host1:This is the most miserable-sounding tune I've ever heard! Host2: It's not the stuff that you'll want to play on your first birthday, Tina, is it? Host1: No, not really. Guest: It's interesting video though, that?s Thom York... there, as you can see, look, it's filling up with water! Host1: Oh, God! Guest: And it actually goes up the whole way, you, probably, quite... enjoy, 'cause he actually drowns at the end, probably, you'll like that. Guest: It's like, i think it's a reconstruction of Houdini's last stunt. But that's it. It just moves up. Guest: And then the song continues and he gets completely covered in water. Hosts1, 2: How does he do that? Does he keep singing? Guest: It's getting very close to the mouth... there. That?s what I?ve always been wondering Host2: Can we fast forward it a little bit or something? Guest: He's not worried because the water is rising Host1: He's lifting his head up there, isn't he? Guest: He is. You know, he's a bit nervy. Host2: I can hear, but I can't see that his lips move. Guest: No, he's through. It?s Roger de Courcey's song. Guest: There we go. He's under now. Guest: But he stays under there, for ages! How he does it, I have no idea. Photographer: Ok, keep it nice in size boys!... All right. And again.

We can get moody, sure? 3: Because of the, you know, it?s the nature of them to want to look very odd. 1: I didn't mind the first one being odd... 3: But if you want to do an hour and a half... 2: So, what did Andy say? 3: I don't feel like having green people? He hasn't said anything to me. 2: But you've told them that you need more light, right, and the whole... conversation yesterday was that we're gonna start with their lights? 1: right, we're starting with their lights now and we need to come up a little bit... 2: right we need to bring the level up a bit 1: well, its not just more light, it's like, this... guy is green... I have the light but he's green. 2: right 2: right, but is he? i'm just asking, what are you getting there? no cooperation... there? they are saying "no, that's not it, we like it like this?" just so that... no, they are not saying anything, we're just not... talking? but apparently the agreement yesterday was... But are you asking for stuff?? Are you asking for stuff you're not getting? No But are you asking something? No Well, maybe you should start asking.. 3: No, they told me to.. 1: All right.

Q; You guys did the 10-Spot last night? What was... it, that 10 Spot? MTV programme? Was it weird? Ed: Yes, i think it looked OK on television. Ed: You know, the trouble with a lot if music in this country... is the radio stations?. Modern rock is such a stale format. Ed: As far as I can work out and we can work out as a band is, the music they... put on the stations is not for the people, it's to satisfy the advertisers. Ed: It's completely reactive as opposed to proactive. Thom: There's a line in "Karma Police"... about 'he buzzes like a fridge' and to me it's sort of, after a while, Thom: you know, when you are driving around in America and you have the... alternative stations on in the background, or in your hotel room, whatever Thom: it's just like a fridge buzzing... it's not... it's all I'm hearing. I'm just hearing buzz. Thom: It's really odd. It's kinda funny there already. You just have to laugh. Q: Well, the one song you had that was really embraced... Thom: Yeah, that had that fridge buzzing you know. Q:... by the modern rock format was "Creep", you... know? that first came in with that, it was like... Thom: That was a good fridge buzz. Thom: If they gonna call it a concept recording they gonna... focus on the technology thing and.., then just let them. It's fucking noise anyway.

Ed: What kind of Polaroids...? ***'Pearly*' Thom: The short history of the 20th century, I mean I'm not very good with all that stuff Thom: but there is a point when.. when countries.. whatever country.. Thom: it almost happened Mexico beginning of the... year. Because of the legacy of.. Mmm.. Errr... Thom: All the money that was lent to countries, developing countries. Thom: Then you have vast conglomerates using, using the labour... of those countries, this is justified as the marketplace, Thom: this is justified as this is how the world economy... works, this is how it works, this is how it should be. Thom: We take new countries on. We're the loansharks... and you know that the West is the huge loanshark Thom: And we're crippling these countries that could potentially develop, and... have to develop. And we do it in such a way that we're basically extorting them. Thom: The banking system is going to collapse. Ed: Should we take a little break? Probably would... be very good to us to take a little holiday. Laughter. Much as we love one, it's great. Jonny: We are coming across bands now that own... hotels and you know they just.. it does put you off? Jonny: and have investment companies and have more business. There's a documentary done recently about Pink Floyd Jonny: and when it was shown to Pink Floyd they... refused to have it released, because it basically... showed them going out to business meetings and... board rooms and discussing moving money around. Jonny: it's not what we're gonna do. Ed: Take it easy, that's what will happen. Jonny: I say, yeah. Kaching! Money! Kaching! Ed: ?going to think that Radiohead is I mean a guitar band which we know. But it's very difficult for us to be able to get any... objectivity about, you know, particularly in this last... year there have been a lot of polls, it's been a lot... of critical acclaim and the gigs have got larger. Very difficult to tell where we actually are, so, I mean, you know, it's a good thing... to be worrying about, and we all share the same fears that Thom, you know, said, but at the same time, we actually don't really know where we are at the... moment because we haven't been able to stop and draw ourselves back... nagoya.'climbing up the walls', 'paranoid android' and 'planet telex'. ***fukuoka.'follow me around' Thom: Everything that happened after Glastonbury has been... a letdown. In one way, in the way that.. that.. umm.. Thom: The feeling when the lights went on, and... when I shouted at our lighting engineer to turn... on the lights onto the audience so we could... see somebody, because we couldn't see anything. Thom: and then it's like 40,000 people all along and up the hill with... lighters and whatever, they had fires going in the distance and tents, Thom: I have never ever felt like that, it was.. it wasn't a... human feeling, it was something else, completely different. Q: And as a result "OK Computer" becomes sort of manical-depressive album for me. Q: Your previous album, your old record sound quickly old? Q: I tried to ask about "OK Computer" and it?s going... Q: I'm sorry, I'm really... Jonny: You have got a 'Teletubbies' watch on. Q: Yeah. Girl: You're a bit too tall for her. Thom: You will become a hypocrite, you'll become a liar, you'll try and... paper up your own cracks on your own, you know,... and everybody does it, Thom: that's what being an adult is. Then you have babies and.. that's it. Thom: Sorry. dinner ready.... ***tokyo.'i will' Thom: I'm really, really, really worried... that we have been going too long on bravado Thom: believing we're as wonderful as everyone tells us we are. Thom: Well, Jonny, last year we would be the most hyped band, we... were in all... we were number one, you know, in all the polls Thom: and it's bullocks, man. This is bullocks. Jonny: Yeah, you know, that's.. that's.. yeah. Ed: Of course, it?s bollocks, but unfortunately, it's the nature of you making an album. Jonny: But I don't see why that should change what we do. Thom: But of course it fucking changes your mental... It changes how, you know, lot of things change and we? Thom: It's just a headfuck, it's a complete headfuck. Isn't it? Thom: The way that we work is that we always have... this bravado, and we all sort of say, that we... decided to do something, and then we go "Yeah!", we'll go and do it, and then we are like... We do. Ed: Isn't it really that the excitement level's gone a bit? Thom: Yeah, Ed: ?rather than, rather than the expectation Thom: I just feel we should get out while the going's good. Thom: If you're bored of the songs, you're bored of... the songs, and there's not much you can do about it. Jonny: We've got to have a long break to make the new ones. ***'Tourist' Thom: I guess it was.. I guess.. ***fukuoka Ed: Everything will be fine!

Q:Do you feel like, almost like a different band since that first tour? Thom: I remember being on the plane all the time and? getting pretty low... Q: Are you going to perform at the Grammy's? Thom: Well, they've said that we weren't good for the ratings Q: Are you serious? Thom: Yeah, yeah. It was cool, we were so happy, man, you wouldn't believe it. Q: When do you think you'll start work on the next album? Thom: no idea Thom: It's like a supply and demand thing. It's like, well, this is what they want me to do, what they want me to... Thom: this is what they want to hear, so i'll do more... of this, because this is great, and then nothing. Thom: It's been a demise of so many recording artists, because... you suddenly, suddenly these people start to give me cash, as well Thom: soon you got the money, you got used to this... lifestyle and you don't want to take any risks Thom: 'cause they got you by the balls, you don't want to... take risks this, you know, you've got all this baggage Thom: you're carrying around with you everywhere and you can't let go you... know, you've got all these things you've bought or you are attached to? Thom: he starts getting, you know, he starts spending... all his money, that's how they, that's how they get you. Jonny: We gonna wait 6 months after this tour, because there's been too much about us in the press Jonny: and we're slighly embarrassed about it in a very English fashion. Jonny: And obviously, there will be backlash. If you... believe the hype, you have to believe the backlash, too. Announcer: Any criticism we get is always stuff we have... already criticized ourselves with anyway, Jonny insists. Jonny: you read one bad and you read 100 good ones, and the bad one always seems to make more sense to you. Q: Could that just say something about you, Jonny? Jonny: I doubt it, Anyway, it's for you to decide, you're the journalist. Q: Ah, there he has me. ***london.'big boots' Thom: There's something in it! Thom: Fuck it, Jonny, just leave it. Make it resonate a bit more... Jonny: Ok. Thom: it needs to be a little over the top? That's it, that's it. Thom: We are trying the usual, sort of, you know... We've been actually... working all day, and all we've got that's any good is the bass and the guitar. ***new york. Band: You did it! You did it. It's great. Thom: Thank you. This next one is kind of a... new song. I don't really have a title for it. Thom: This is a song about believing you're actually... wonderful when you know it's not true. Yeah. Here we go. 1: Hi, Thom. 2: Hi, Thom! How are you? 3: Good to see you. ***matt pinthall show Woman: five, four, three. Host: Hey, it's Matt Pinthall back here with Thom Yorke from Radiohead at Radio Music City Hall. Host: Thom, the new song you are doing live is called... 'Big Ideas '... I love that title, by the way? Thom: That's good, actually it didn't have a title. I... wanted to call it, I mean, I don't know what to call it. Thom: when you get a mortgage in Britain for your house, you know all the... adverts for mortgages and so on, they all have this thing at the bottom saying Thom: that "your home is at risk if you do not keep up repayments". Thom: I wanted to give it that as the title. But I'm not sure if it's catchy enough. ***'Big Ideas' Thom: Got to find another note, ?cos I can?t go like that? ***matt pinthall show Woman: Five, four, three. Host: Welcome back to 120 minutes of Matt Pinthall joined here with Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and we?re at Radio City Music Hall. Host: Thom, good to be back with you now. Thom: Yes, it's nice to see you again. Host: You know it's great to have you on the show. Host: You know, it's been I guess almost a... year now, when we last got together, on the... air, anyway, an we talked about "OK Computer", right at the time it was coming out. Host: It's got an amazing response for the record since it obviously... critics favored it, it made it best of the year list and, you know, Host: you had all the best-band votes. How do you feel... about that? There's been such a vibe about you last year. Thom: You know, when we started it up, it was, it was great, because we, we... the first thing, we finished the album, Thom: we were convinced that the critics would can it, because it wasn't.. you know, and they didn't. And they did the exact... opposite, which was really weird. And then, mm? Thom: Thanks. Thom: We're going home now. Thank you very much for coming. Thom: Oh, well, we fucked that up! Ed: It was really good though, Phil. Thom: Hey, chaps! I mean, camera chaps. I think you should stop now. I think it's the end. ***'Exit music'
