Where are they going with the Jeep when the fuel prices are soaring!? Are they going to resolve a public issue? They aren't so good enough. As usual, they would've created some ruckus. That's why, they're going around. You don't know about them, isn't it? One of them is Ashok and the other one is Anand. They both are close friends from childhood. Just because they're close, don't think they will always be united. They won't stay united in any way. But, there is a place where both of them will be together. Kabaddi! One of the guy is defence player and the other one is an offence player. Both the captains come here. Are they inherent or intentionally doing this? I don't know even though I'm with them all these years. On eve of 'Karaikudi goddess chariot festival'... Choose one. Your choice. The toss. It's tail! The toss won by 'Super South Boys'. In today's finale, 'Super South Boys team' and ' Rastha Royal Tigers team'... Hey! Ashok, we must rock. Ashok, don't give up as he is your friend. The dignity of our clan is in your hands. Yes. The son of our soil, philanthropist, respected Mr. Thennarasu... Dude, this match is headed by your uncle. If we lose, it'll be a shame. You must win. Do you remember the practice sessions? It's the finale where both the mountains collide each other. The captain of 'Rastha Royals Tiger team' star of hope, Anand. He is the state level offence player. If he starts playing, the opponents will panic. But, today the opponent is 'Super South Boys' Captain Ashok. The best defence player of Tamil Nadu. He'll take goals just like that. Anand has taken one point, on bonus. He is playing well. Who is he? Anand, my sister's son. -Okay! The great player, Mansoor Murugesan. He is cleaning up. Cleaning up both the sides. Oh, no! He didn't take any point. An empty raid. Third raid! Do or die raid. Let him come... But, going towards Ashok is like giving our head to the shark. Hey, catch. Didn't I tell? Is it a just a catch? An iguana catch. Can you escape from Ashok's catch? The 'South Boys team' has scored one more point. If Dharmaraj takes a raid... ...it's like 'Yama, the lord of death' is going on ride. Wonderful game! Wow! He took a point by good reach. All the raids by Anand is good. Reach will be fast. Come on. Don't be hurry. Kabaddi! Look, how well he played! Excellent skill! Now, it's the turn of Sathyaraj. Last year, he had played in Tamil Nadu... Look, he is coming... He is a good player. Catch him as I taught. He will take point. -Catch him, fast. Throw away. They got it. Hey, go forward. He is the gold of our hometown... -Touch and hit. He is Subash. -Catch him. He is going to get applause. Oh, gosh! it became a fun. As it's of no use on depending the offence player... ...Ashok, the defence player has taken up. Wonderful attempt! -Kabaddi... Good kick! Ashok has scored a point. Anand is getting into field to do surgical strike. Let him come. Leave him to come forward. Anand has done a great job! -Kabaddi... Anand made his team to lead the match. Three points in a single raid. Half-time Side change. It's over for Rastha. Rastha Royals begins the raid. As of now, the match is favourable to 'Rastha Royal team'. Anand was out of the match. They shot the tiger in the team. Only 'Rastha Royal' is left. What a difficult stance for the team? Come on. He got it. Though Ashok caught him in right angle, he crossed the lobby. Now, both the teams are struggling without their captains. Be careful. -Let's see, who wins the match. He is coming! Tackle him. Catch the player and score a point. Don't squeeze the player. Only if Sathyaraj scores a point, their captain Ashok can rejoin. Sathyaraj has scored a point. Ashok has come to the field again. Last thirty seconds. Third round. Do or die raid. The last one. Kabaddi... Don't leave, Ashok. The match will be serious now. No one can tackle Anand in Kabaddi. And no one was left by Ashok. Who is going to win! It'll be known now. Kabaddi... Both are out. One point for 'Super South Boys' and bonus point for 'Rastha Royal Tigers'. The 'Rastha Royal Tigers team' won the match. Both the teams have played well. Congratulations to both the teams. Now, our Chief guests will distribute the prizes. Both of you played well. -Thank you, sir. I've noted, you both didn't give up at anytime. But, I've a doubt. Anand is good as an offence player and Ashok is good as defence player. If both of you play together, that team will be strong. Why are you playing, separately? How great the team is, it'll face the defeat, one day. He might lose to me and so I. But, we both will never lose to others. Excellent! "When we go to play, we will stand in opposite sides" "On the way out, we go with our hands on the shoulders" "No matter who wins, we will dance and rejoice" "We will be strong" "We will be just looking like problematic " "We will give our life to save a friend" "The enigmatic path is our life" "We will roam to rock the eight directions" "When we go to play, we will stand in opposite sides" "On the way out, we go with our hands on the shoulders" "No matter who wins, we will dance and rejoice" "We will be strong" Do you've ten rupees? -Hey, get lost. You stay blessed. You too stay blessed. You must offer from your pocket. Not from others. If I've given from my pocket, he'd have blessed me. Now, he had blessed both of us, isn't it? "Even if time keeps you at an unspecified distance" Hey! "When the trouble comes the eyes search for the friend" Nothing! Come on. Hey, come aside. "Always kith and kin around" "Whatever it is, a friend is a friend..." "Like a kite, we will sway here and there" "More and more... the friend has love and bears us in heart". "There is no example for our friendship" "We never asked to excuse our mistakes" "We will not wish good morning and good evening for namesake" "This is our friendship!" Mam, is sir there? Who are you? What's the matter? Sir has placed an order for a cot. Shall I bring inside? Is it? Bring it. Hey, bring it. Be careful. Lift slowly. Keep down for a minute. What's this? -Tell me, mam. It looks like an old cot. It's an old cot only. But made of teakwood. Sir has placed an order for this. Don't want this cot. Take it out. Oh, no! Dear, you've asked for a cot. It's made of teakwood. If we buy a new one, it costs sixty thousand rupees. But I bought it for lesser cost, you deny it. It's okay if you don't buy me a new cot. I'll sleep on the floor. For that sake, don't bring old things used by others to my house. Do you understand? She irates saying as new... Brother... What to do? Take away. Take away, carefully. Is it a new cup? -Yes, dad. Did you win? -No, dad. I've stolen it. You too tease me. Go and show to your mom. -Okay, dad. She is waiting for you. Where are you going? -I'm going somewhere. Who is showing respect to me? Go... If you talk like this, not respect even food will be denied. Stacking these cups hurts my hand. It looks beautiful. Hey! -What mom? When you know my brother is the Chief guest... ...you'd have skipped. Instead, you're playing Kabaddi. Mom, am I involved in pickpocket? I went to play Kabaddi. I'm seeking his daughter as bride for you. If you play along with the wastrels, how will he accept for the marriage? Have you started? Did I say, I'll marry your niece? If you've such an imagination, I'm not responsible for it. Always saying the same... You'll get a bride if you win in life. Win in life? Mom, did he marry you only after he won in life? Not at all. He didn't have any job even after marriage. My father got him a job in the income tax department. In our days, we got married though we didn't have job. Nowadays, so many queries arising from bride's family. That too, if you play Kabaddi, not the bride... ...no one will give even the photo of the bride. If you proceed this way, I'll not get a bride in this life. How to find then? -Ask like that. What's this? -An egg. Always thinking of eating. This is the world! Ohhh! What's this? -You tell. This is India. This is Tamil Nadu. These dots are the caste which are prevailing here. If you search in this single dot, you'll not get a bride. You'll dock a few in the name of astrology. How will you get then? Search widely. Widely? Let's search. How long you search, you can't get a bride like my niece. Oh, gosh! I'm telling you I don't want to get married. But, you keep talking about your niece. Are you going to be a saint without getting married? I've an ambition and I'm going towards it. Don't disturb me. This is like a rock. Better, both of you eat it. When he is saying about ambition, why are you getting tensed? Then? His parents are calling me, in the morning... ...and asking what's his ambition? Don't I know his ambition? Having tea in the nearby shop. Hello! -Thank you. You're coming along. -I've coffee. Oh, great difference! I'm frustrated as no one is willing to give me bride. He too irates. I don't know what's this nonsense. He is a nuisance. It's not good for health. -English too... No, it's Bhojpuri. -That's nothing, Appachi... ...When they suddenly asked, I don't know what to say. It's wrong to deny marriage like you do... ...and it's wrong to hanker for marriage like him. You must be neutral like me, isn't it, dude? Why didn't you get a bride, yet? How can I tell that? People ask,are you working in Ambani's company? You're just working with Appachi. Isn't it? People say, they won't give bride for those working as collection agents. It's a shame. For you too... I've brides queuing up. As you work in the finance companies, you're denied a bride, right? If you say, you own this company? Already, they're saying the same. -Is it? If you tell us to thrash someone, we'll do. Don't tell us to say lies. Look him! I'm telling you the fact. I'm also getting old. Who is there for me? -I'm there. Better, you take up the company. Even big banks have gone bankruptcy lending huge money. I'm running this business for forty years. Except,I've let a few people to live, I was never cheated by anyone. If you can run this the same way, I'll transfer the ownership to you. Else, I'll give to some passerby. Don't get angry. He is a small boy. Doesn't know about your kind heart. We'll run the business as good as you. But, let's change the name. 'Appachi finance' seems to be an old name. Shall we name it stylishly as, 'Appacha finance'? Appacha... You won't be the right ones. You might change the name, place and finally you'll change me. That's the plan. Until I'm alive, You're the partners in the business. Partners? So, we've to work without salary. Yes, the accounts will be right, if you calculate it. Only footwear will fly. 'Along those narrow streets, when the people are going on...' You're taking me like a pilgrimage to Palani. We would've come by bike. How far is it to go, still? It's very near, just ten kilometres. Hey, no! I'll go back. Instead of walking back for twenty kilometres, it's better to walk this ten kilometres. Roads haven't been laid to this town. But, you're coming with coolers. Hold the umbrella, properly. You doesn't know about this town. Last week, people from Shriram chits came to seize the bike. Okay. Do you know what they did? -What? They grabbed the bikes of those who came and thrashed them. Then? It's said, this is the native place of Vijay Mallya. Keep overstating. Is this the house? -Yes. Pandi brother! Pandi brother! -Who is that? We have come from 'Appachi finance'. No one is in the house. I've a technique for these people. Watch now. Pandi. Hey, Pandi. Who is this, now? Panchayat elections are approaching. That's why, we came to distribute money for votes. Is there anyone in the house? Is it! Come in. Come soon. Look, how he opens his mouth wide? I'll go inside, topple with this umbrella in his mouth. Come in, sir. Didn't pay the due for four months, But, he wants a Royal Enfield bike. Look, how is he sitting and eating. -Come on. Yeah, coming. Brother! -What? Keep the cash ready. -Okay. We'll cast the vote, perfectly. Don't cheat by giving token etc... But, you'll cheat not paying debts. Who are you? We're from 'Appachi finance'. I told you that no one is in the house. Hey, if no one is in house, are you a ghost? You can't pay the due for the bullet, but talk more? Who is Pandi, here? Pandi? Ask as,'Bullet Pandi'. He is my son. Why? He didn't pay the due for that bullet. If not paid the due, will you come to the house and ask? Will we come to the toilet and ask? If you've lend the money, you've to come to the toilet also. Do you know it? What's the hell is he talking when having food? Look dude, now the time isn't good. The astrologer has told not to give the money. Come after two or three months. Let's see what to do. -Then, let we do one thing. We'll take away the bullet. You pay the due after three months and get it back. Come, let's go. What is he doing? -It's right that you people are outsiders. You can't even take a hand full of mud from here. That too, how dare are you... ...to take away the bullet from my house? Hey, old goof! We don't want mud, we'll take the bullet. Leave us. Hey, dude! -What? If you touch the bike, it's like touching my moustache. If you are bold enough, touch it. Let me see, it's either you or me! You must stay away and talk, don't come close. Having a moustache like a vessel cleaning scrub, ...you utter punch dialogues too? Who asked you to say punch dialogues? You scrub faced, you couldn't repay the debts. Dude, give me a chance. You go and handle the bike. -I'll handle him. You hold it. -Give me. If you've a big moustache beneath the nose, will you speak harsh? The moustache has covered half of the mouth. You speak more with this. Come on. Why are you holding him? Leave him. -Where am I holding him? My hand got stuck. It's not coming. Leave him. His moustache has come along. He is pelting the stone. Hey, go away. -Stop. Oh, no! Appachi, it's deficit of four thousand rupees this month too. Four thousand rupees! New coolers. -Hey, it's four rupees. You say as four thousand. The company's name is oakley. And you haven't seen it. Damn it. You know the Puliyur people will create ruckus. Why are you lending them loans? Those who don't create ruckus will go to the banks. Those who create ruckus will come here only. You mean, Puliyur? Where did you go at Puliyur? Pandi... We gave a bullet, right? -Yes. It's him. Oh, no! He has paid four months due, yesterday. Did he pay the due, yesterday? -Doing everything faulty… …and wearing coolers too. What to do with you? Bottle, you give back the bullet keys. -Oh, gosh! It seems to be a good tale. You go... I've more work. -No, I can't. Why are you quarreling? Pandi will come. Talk to him and give the bike. Hey! Who has taken my brother's bullet? They have come. If you're bold enough to be a man, come out. There are no men, here. Go away. Good! Who touched my father's moustache? Come out. Did you touch the moustache? Is that very important now? Go and convince them. Else, they will keep shouting. -Dude, Don't create ruckus instead of convincing. I'm going to convince. Appachi, tell them. I told you to collect the money but you've grabbed his moustache. Oh, no! It's not me. Only him. Appachi, I didn't grab it. It came on it's own. What can I do? If the police complaint is filed, I'll not spend money. Be careful. Else, you'll give as bundles. You go. They will hit me. I'll not go. Sorry, brother. A small mistake has happened. Who took the bullet? Ask him to come out. Thinking that you didn't pay the due, our guys took the bike. Here is the keys. Take the bike and go. Hey, you shouldn't take the bike even if haven't paid the due. I've paid the money, how will you bring the bike then? Are you dare enough? A mistake has happened this time. I'll take care, hereafter. Don't create ruckus. Take the bike. Hey, the bike is nothing to me. Call the one who touched my dad's moustache. I'll not leave from here unless I cut his hand. Yeah, it's our mistake, brother. I punished him. I apologize to you instead of him. What? Do you apologize instead of him? Will you give birth to a child if he gets married? Call him. Hey, only the customer should lend his hand and take money from us. We shouldn't stretch our hand. It's all because of you. Do you know what he said? Shut your trap and go. How dare you touch him? They have started the fighting. Come, let's take leave and go home. No, let's go and have a tea. So, he started. Bhai, two cups of tea. He has scolded me before everyone. Is it new? Leave it. Ashok, what's the problem? Anand is thrashing everyone. Does he need a reason to create ruckus? He is thrashing everyone as he has long hands and legs. Bhai, who is he? He is an outsider. -That's it. Who will have tea in your shop? You shouldn't drink like that. You have it like this. You shouldn't drink in hurry. -Ashok, no... Don't pour down... The earlobe was torn. Will this head to the police station? It'll go till the prison. He must be imprisoned under Goondas act. All my positive attitudes are hiding his negativity. That's why, everyone trusts him to be good. Hey! Oh, no! Don't go that side. He might bang you. Go this way. Hey, are you watching IPL match? Go and stop the fighting. He might kill someone. Oh, no! It's enough! Already, everyone looks like the photo in Aadhar card. Don't send everyone to prison for the sake of small moustache. Come on. Go... Tell me, dad. Is my son next to you? He isn't here, dad. What's the matter? Nothing, you know how tough it is to find a bride for Ashok. Yes dad. It's tough. -Is this how you speak? Last week, he got furious for not looking a bride for him... ...he drew an image,marked the parts and humiliated us. So, I pleaded the matchmaker and selected a bride. On coming Wednesday, we'll go to see the bride. Convey this to him. Okay, dad. I'll tell him. Dad, do you've the photo of the bride? Photo? Why? No, dad. If he doesn't like the bride after going there... ...it'll be a disgrace to all of us. That's why, I said. Will he say that he doesn't like the bride? Let us see, whether the bride likes him, first? That's also right, dad. Where does the bride belong to? Pillayarpatti. Pillayarpatti? Where is the location? Opposite to the temple, the house at the right side is, 'Malliga Illam'. Yes, 'Malliga Illam' No.79, Red colour gate. Is that house, dad? Only one 'Malliga Illam' is there on that street. That's the bride's house. Go to the temple and come soon. -Okay, dad! Okay, mom. Please. Go. Aunty! -Kavya! How are you? -I'm doing good. Get me the bill. Bill this along with mine. -Okay. I saw you when you went this side. I was waiting for you to come here. What happened? Someone is following me for long time. I have sent him. Aunty, what are you saying? He is Anand's friend, Ashok. As I said you're going to get married to Anand... ...he is coming around you. What's your name? -Kavya. What are you studying? -I'm doing MCA. You should do higher studies like me. What did you study? -I did diploma in... Why do you need? Do you know to cook? Do you know to eat? It's known well when looking at you. Aunty! -Hey, be quiet. It's getting late. You leave. Convey my regards to my brother and sister-in-law. Bye, aunty. -Go carefully. Just a minute. Take this. Thank you. I expected you will deny. Why? You go, dear. -Just for fun, mom. How is the bride? She is looking plumpy and cute. Your friend doesn't want to marry her. Don't worry. I'll convince him to get married. Can I believe you? We have told him a lot. Mom, are we both the same? I'm Ashok. His friend. He'll obey me. It's the final. Okay? Are you going to throw shotput? It's a game. Do you know? Look now. How it's thrown! Look now. Well done. How is it? It pierced for forty times. Look, I'll accept if you say that you're the captain for Kabaddi. But, I'm playing this game for years together. This game has warm-up too. On the whole, only it pierced for four times. You've become old. You don't have clear visibility.. You must behave honestly like a gentleman. You don't have that. I'll not play with you. -Wonder, you say that? I shouldn't have befriended you. Go away. Don't be angry. I'll get you food. I'm not coming. -Don't be angry. Dude! -What? Your mom has selected a bride studying MCA. You're playing with wastrels. Aren't you ashamed? Hey, I said I'll not come. did you heed me? You've tied a bandage too. Tell him. He will get angry. Is she my uncle's daughter? Just now I met her. You get married to her. I gave word to your mom. Leave it. I've seen a bride for you. You? -Not me. It's your father who has selected a bride for you. I saw her. Not for namesake. She looks awesome! She will bleed if pinched. When did you last see your Uncle's daughter? That's long back. So what? Look her now. She will bleed without pinching. Was she hurt? I said she is fair. You both adore the brides in turns fixed for you. Good friendship! Why are you jealous? -Wonderful! Leave it. I wish to see those brides when you admire. Take me too. Why? Should they run away? Leave my hand. -Dude, your uncle's daughter... Go away. I say only for your goodness. Will you listen or not? I'll listen. Tell me. Where is he? What? "Who made that painting to step out?" "Has the time come to hang it in your house?" "Has the glass house had an eye on her?" "When she stood in front, eyes were glaring" "She is not the beauty of the world" "She is not the moon" "She seems to be friendly to move on" "Not much smile, Not much fair..." "She rocks like a beautiful painting" "She comes likes a poetry" "She comes like a dream" "She suits you, perfectly" "She is for you, the locale Ellora painting" Who? Is it her? Go away. "She is your uncle's daughter!" "Her eyes resembles the eyes of a fish" "She is the right pair for you" "I wondered looking her" "What could I say?" "She is the most beauteous" "Everyday, step by step... Practice to say, 'I love you'..." Hey, it's enough! Hey! Shall I sing about your bride? Listen it. Are you going to sing? Let me listen. "The angel I saw didn't have the wings, really" "I've never seen a woman like her, recently" "Though she is standing on the shore, she floats, gently" "She is a peacock moulded with gold" "Plucked plenty of flowers" "And like sprinkled honey on leftovers is her beauty" "In a fearful glance..." "One of the elated poetry, Should be on print" "Like a mole on the Katchatheevu" "She is a like a green foliage" "She is so beautiful" "She is..." "Can fall for her" I wish to see her. -Is it? come on. "Her eyes are the poetic page" "I saw her pure shyness in that" "If she comes forward and stands" "The moon will stand behind her" "On the whole, no one in this locale is like her" "If she comes by your side, you will fly in the sky" Oh, my goodness! The house is locked. Sakthi, Kavya, get down, carefully. Do you've the umbrella? Why do you come without the umbrella? Dad, the house is locked. Didn't you inform, we're coming? How can we come without informing? Our bride's house is upstairs. What? Upstairs? The downstairs girl will look beautiful. Can we go to the houses where the girls are beautiful? We've to see the girl residing upstairs. Come on, everyone. You keep talking. Welcome! Welcome, dude! Brother, I've seen the downstairs girl. She looks beautiful. Is the girl residing upstairs also look beautiful? Doesn't she look beautiful when the downstairs girl is beautiful? Go... See the bride and fix the date. -He is speaking without any logic. Hey, what are you talking there? Come on. Are you going to pay me? Greetings! Are you good? Greetings, son-in-law! Welcome! Son-in-law? Welcome, son-in-law All the best. Welcome, son-in-law. Welcome, son-in-law. I'm the bridegroom. Don't call everyone as son-in-law. Okay, welcome son-in-law. The light looks good, isn't it? -Yes! Just now you've come. Wait, they will give. What does he need? Don't know. Where is he? Why is he more curious than me to see her? You saw her, on that day, right? I've seen her on that day. I just want to see how she comes before you. Hope you won't you forget us after marriage? Why should I get along with you all after marriage? After leaving from here, we will part ways. Oh, god! Take the juice. Thank you, sister. Hey, why did you say as sister? Oh, sorry! Thank you, sister-in-law. She is the bride! Don't make fun. You're pranking me, right? I swear, she is the bride. In this... Hey come here. Is she the bride? Did you see her? -Yes, I saw. What? Who is she? -I too have the same doubt. It's tough to get a bride, nowadays. -Okay. Hello! That too for both of us, it's very tough. So? Don't look for beauty. Look for character. I'll tell, she is perfect for you. What's the character you've noted for just giving soft drinks? Have you seen her after giving soft drinks? She went back without lifting her head. We will not get such a bride. She must have neck sprain. I'm getting nervous. Everyone is watching us. Nod your head for everything. Let's talk after going home. After nodding here, what to say at home? I didn't like the bride. Tell them, I'll revert after I go home. Bridegroom, do you like the girl or do you like her very much? You stupid. Bridegroom feels shy. I want to speak to the bride. You can talk for long time after marriage. Won't they mistake if you want to talk now? In-law, the bride wants to talk with the bridegroom. Most welcome... Hey, speak politely to the bride. Don't hurt her. Okay? You shut up. -Okay. Speak boldly. -He'll speak. She is waiting upstairs. You don't worry for anything. Don't you regret what you've done is wrong? I'm asking you, reply me. You advice others. Pity on her. How she would have felt, when you denied her before everyone? What's the secret they both are talking? I feel ashame to say you as my friend. I'm talking to you. Open your mouth and speak. Open your mouth. Why are you staring? -You shut your mouth. What? Actually... From my childhood, I've more dreams about my husband. Even you can think, why is she having an arranged marriage... ...instead of love marriage? Many people like you proposed their love to me. But, I didn't accept anyone. I like guys who look like the stars Ramarajan, Rajkiran and Napoleon. So, I think you'd have understood what I mean? No, I can't understand. I mean, I don't like you. What? Come again. I mean, I don't like you. I don't like you. It's gone! She doesn't like you, great! From the time we went to the bride's house... ...he said he doesn't like the bride. Instead of bringing him back, You were waiting till the bride denies and made him ashamed. Fatso! -Don't poke him. Tell me, stick man. -Do you know one thing? What's that? -Thousand proposals came for me. All the proposals had problem with horoscope and status. But, no one turned down citing as they didn't like me. Do you hear me? No one said they don't like me. Do you know this? You made me to get teased by him. I came trusting your words, isn't it? How you sang? Do you remember? I forgot. -I remember it. "Plucking numerous flowers and spilling the honey..." "...that's how her beauty is". Who? Was she? That is... the bride was mistaken. That's your fault. Will you convince me and get married to her? She is pityful. I'll not forgive you. Never look at my face. Thank you. -You too. Look! Wait, you'll reap the fruit definitely. Dude, lie-down like Schumacher and do the work. I'll get sprain, then. Hey! They made it. Brother, I need the bike, urgently. Why? any accident? Take the Jeep and go. -Brother, simply asking what happened? They have hit one of our guy. Who did they hit? -Our Nandu kunji! Hey, I didn’t ask where they hit. But, who got hit? -That’s what, I said! They hit “Nandu kunji” on his chest. Hey, you dump head. Why did they hit him? Last week, he hit them! Then, why did he hit them? Since, a week before they hit him. Why did they hit him a week before? Because, he hit them a week before. Hey, stop it. Who hit first? Brother, why are you asking like this? We hit them first. -Is it a pride? Why did you hit them? -Brother, why are you asking like a dolt. What? Am I asking like a dolt? -Do we remember all these? The nation is facing many problems, fighting for NEET and Ethane. Being idle, you indulge in street fights. And get thrashed by trespassers. If asked, you say we're dolts. -Give a blow on his mouth. If I see you again in this street, I'll hit you by the vehicle. Brother, do we have so many problems in our nation? I'm unaware of it. What will you do knowing it? Would have posted as my status on Facebook. Facebook! Today... Pelt on his head. -Go and die on your own. Start the vehicle, see. what am I going to do? On the way, Iet's thrust him in the 'five falls'. Go fast. Ashok, he is yet to get ready. Trusting you, I've promised my brother that I'll come to see the bride. Don’t spoil my honor. Mom, why do you worry now? It’s my responsibility to bring him. Where are you now? Turn around and see. Where is he? -Upstairs! Hey, what are you doing here? Come, let’s go. All are waiting for you. Did I say to wait! I said, I don't want to get married. Why are you repeatedly asking the same and torturing me? Understand what I say. I'm talking, since I understood. The girl you fell in love, got married and left. That’s over. You've to forget and move on. Thinking of it, don’t torture the people in the house. For an hour, two breaking news are flashed. But for past two years, you're thinking of the same incident. It’s easy to advise others. You will realize, only if you undergo the same. Should that happen to us? It will not happen to you. You need to have a heart. Oh, what a guy? You don’t talk about kind hearted and conscience. I know the stance, how you fixed the bride for me. I shouldn't have pardoned you. But I did, though. Now, pleading you for sake of a good bride. Who will get a kind hearted friend like me? Nobody will get! At least for this, Let's go, come on. Hey, understand. Hey, I'll not understand. You leave now. The family doesn't understand. At least, you understand me. Is this your uncle’s house? Looks like Ram vilas of our town. Come in! -Greetings! Brother! -Welcome, sister. Are you doing good? -I'm doing good. Sister-in-law, how are you? -Hope all are fine. Welcome, bridegroom! come in. Hey, children! sit down. Now I understand, why did you say he should marry your brother’s daughter? Why? The house looks awesome, and to take hold of it, right! Don’t reveal all the secrets! Is it? -Hey, be quite! Dad! It's you! Why are you all silent? Someone talk. Sir, I will talk. We, ourselves shouldn’t say proud about Anand. He has got many proposals. But, he is stubborn to marry the girl, whom his mother likes. Have you seen such an obedient son, anywhere? What he said is right! In this generation, who is getting married within relationships? Both brother and sister have brought up their children well. Feel proud of them. -Golden hearted! He is my eldest son-in-law. -Welcome! Greetings! -You must've seen him in marriage. He is back from abroad a month ago. Be seated, son-in-law. Though the bride belongs to our family... ...but, we've to follow our own customs. ask her to come. Ask Kavya to come. You go and bring her. Hey, look at her! Greet the elders! Have a look at her! If new to the family, we can ask what will you afford? But, we are relatives. So, look for an auspicious day and let's fix the wedding. Uncle, let’s not hurry! Why, son-in-law? What happened? Let’s finalize after checking the horoscope. They have come here, after checking the horoscope. What I'm trying to say is... -Brother! You’re the eldest son-in-law. If you want to say anything, tell frankly. Why to restrain? What's there to hesitate among relations? That’s right! Who is he? -Ashok! friend of Anand. They both are friends for past 20 years. He knows Anand better than I do. Hello! I've seen him, somewhere. Who is this? Brother, he is from abroad. That’s why, he came or else who will have tea in your shop? Please, don’t mistake me for saying this. If we get a proposal from strangers, we won't be sure of their family stance. That's why, we prefer to get married within the relationships. I heard wrong about Anand. What's that you heard wrong? Who said wrong about my son? He plays kabaddi and my brother is aware of it. People will gossip, we shouldn’t bother as we are kith and kin. I wouldn’t have believed if someone has told me. When said by groom’s long time friend Ashok, How can I not believe it? Sir! Sir! I said it for fun, why are you taking it, seriously? Do you mean what you said was for fun? I don’t want to say in this forum. What did I say? Bhai, Anand is a big accused. His only good habit is his friendship with me and my only bad habit is him. Because of him, how many arguments and cases! He has to be arrested in Goondas act. You don’t believe, right! -No! Brother, tell about Anand! Brother, why to talk about him when going for a good deed? He is a rogue, my daughter's life was ruined because of him. My family was shattered. Feel ashamed to go out. I curse him. Enough, you are busy. Go to work. What he said is nothing. Still, there are many. He is clever, that’s why, he accompanies me, always. All my positive things are hiding his negatives. Bhai, in spite of it, one day his real identity will be revealed. He will get exposed, confirmedly. Mom, he didn't lie. Uncle, our girl's life is important for us. Think well and decide. Is he a friend to you? You've good habituals. We were humiliated before everyone. I curse him, he will be doomed who ruined my son's life. Mom, be quite. Why cursing him! Did he do, deliberately? Just leave it. Keep on saying the same. Have some water. Why to have water? -staring too? This is why, I told you many times not to be playful in everything. I know, where will you be playful and seroius. But, will these people know? What you did for fun made to deny him a bride. What are you going to do now? Nothing! Hey, Ashok! Did you see the film, 'Nerkonda Paarvai'? Yes, I've watched it. Very nice. 'Thala' has acted well. Tomorrow… Priya, you go. I will come. Hey, where are you going? -You go, I'll come and tell you. Okay! What's the matter? Why are you waiting? Anand is not a bad guy, like you people think. They didn't think bad of Anand. The words you told about him, made them to think bad. That's my fault. I never thought, it'll become so serious, which I said just for fun. Is it a fun? For sake of fun, will you speak like this? We will talk worst than this. How do I know, that your uncle will listen it and convey your father? Okay, you said for fun. Even a person has said that his daughter's life... ...was ruined because of Anand. Twister, he has said everything! His daughter fell in love, Anand helped her and got them married . He doesn't like that, So, speaks bad about Anand. To say the fact, she is living happily now than before. Ohh! If you get married to Anand, you too will live happily. He is a good guy and doesn’t have any bad habits. If I want to help someone, I'll think a lot and do. But, he will help without thinking. The other day, he raised his hand since someone spoke bad about me. Your uncle has complained that. If his life gets ruined, because of me... It'll be a guilt all through my life. You will not get a better person than him. Think and take a good decision. Okay, I'll leave. Robo Shankar to receive Oscar award. (Indistinct chatters) Hey, what happened? Ashok has come. Ashok! We were talking about you. Filthy? Talking about me? -Yes! Bhai, then I'll leave. I have work. Hey, you've done enough. Come and sit down. Without putting the stand he will not come. Have the tea! Ashok, instead of telling lies and getting your friend married... ...you spoke the truth and saved a girl’s life. I like you! Not like that, bhai! He is a very good guy, I just said for fun. But... What are you saying? Because you said, even I've conveyed to few people. Bhai, why have you said like this? Better, write it in a slate and hang it in front. Bhai, for taking revenge, Ashok is the best. No one is better than him in the surroundings. Yeah, right! -Is it? He does it so perfectly, even for his friend. Hey, bottle! when did I avenge. Hey, what do you mean for what you have done? Since, they were going to get marry the girl, whom you don’t like... ...You made that none of the girls should like him. Excellent plan! He had done it, perfectly. Hey, don’t spill the coffee. Hey, when that happened? And when this happened? Don’t spread unwanted defamation on me! What defamation are we spreading on you? Are you spreading on him or it's we spreading on you? What body language is this? Defamation! Since morning, you are pulling his legs. leave him. Anand, you are kind hearted, you will forgive. I wasn’t willing to see the bride, since he said, I went. A new story! But, it was halted because of him. I'm not angry on you in any way. But, uncle and Kavya will think bad of me. Already, the relatives started to badmouth. Now, I couldn't face anyone. That's right! When people with us speak badly about me, what to ask others? Hey, look at him! He got angry! Getting anger! -Hey, why are you going? Hey, it's me who should get angry and leave. Instead, you're getting angry and leaving. Ashok! Why did you spill my coffee, since he left? Then, if you drink without buying me? Is tomorrow a holiday! -Yes! Hey, what's the celebrations upto? He is your beau Anand, right? -Yes! To whom is the banner? -For me. Who is the child in the banner? -It's me. Hey, he is very smart. You know that it's you, but others doesn't know. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Brother is waiting for you, inside. Happy birthday to you! Excuse me! Birthday wishes! -Thank you. This is for you. -Why all these? Anand told to give this to you. -What's this? How do I know? You open it and see, he has bought for you. Why did he buy a gold chain? -To show his love. Okay, Why are you bringing this? Didn't Anand come? How will he come? Won't he feel embrassing? Everyday, he is regretting for what has happened. The day you understand him and come for him... ...On that day, he will face you. Kavya, I should tell this to you. I too thought that ocean is big and sky is high. But before Anand's love, this is nothing. He called last night at 3 o'clock and told me a poetry and slept. But I couldn't sleep, thereafter. I was shivering! What’s great about the poetry! Because of shivering, I forgot. I'll send you by WhatsApp. I'll not forget the impact created by the poetry, till my death. What's the use of doing all these? Who will speak to your father? You have to talk. Me! Who else, will 'Solomon Pappaiah' speak for you? Yes! You have to talk. With great difficulty he has written the poetry for you. I'll try to speak to my dad. I'll call you after speaking. Okay! Just a minute! I'm not ashamed to tell you this. Not ashamed? I don't wish to fall in love in my life. Infact, not desired of even getting married. But, when looking the way Anand loves you, I wish to have a love marriage. I swear, if I would've born as a girl... ...I would've envied on you. What to do? Since, born as a male, I got spoilt. Okay, I'll leave. Check out, your attire is getting dirty. He must've worked at Madurai Chintamani theatre. The chain is going upto Karaikudi bus depot. Hey, don't drink more water. -Then, what is that? It'll be overload and lead to kidney failure. Why do you ask us to work hard, if kidney failure occurs? Hey, it's true. it's in WhatsApp! How so soon it came in WhatsApp? Show me! Where is your phone? -It's here. In this phone, you received by WhatsApp! I'll listen if you say to drink less, ...since water is expensive. But you act, smartly. Where are you going? -I'm going to piss! Hey, better piss less! Why didn’t you go? -No, I'll go next week. Take care, salt crystals might form. K! Who is this K? Personal! What's that your personal without my knowledge? I can't keep telling you, everything. It's personal! What personal? Hello, sir! where are you? By tonight, you'll blabber everything. Did you speak to your father? Thought of talking to dad, when he is in good mood. By then, marriage has been fixed. Within a week? -Yes! Who is the bridegroom? From which place? From Ramanathapuram. Have you spoke to the bridegroom? No. Do you know him before? -I don't know. Do you know where is Ramanathapuram? They said, it's three hours journey, from here. Three hours? From your house to Anand's house it's just three minutes. If any problem arises, how will you come from Ramanathapuram? If it's Anand, you know him from childhood and your relative too. And he is from this town. If any ruckus arises... It will not! If it happens, then you can walk to your house in three minutes. You have many advantages. In our life, we should decide... ...what job we should do and whom should we live with? Don’t nod your head since dad or granny said. Why do people respect me and listen to me? Because, I haven’t obeyed my father. That's why. I'm telling you the same, Kavya. Whoever advise you or even if I say... Think well and decide what is good for you. This is the purpose of education and going to college and all. For that, I am not asking you to be a revolutionary like, Dr. Muthulakshmi. You decide your life, that's a big revolution! Can I tell you everything? I can only show you the way. What is this? -Invitation! Have they printed the invitation? Hey, you must've shown this first. I wouldn't have spoken so long. You are speaking continuously and it was interesting... ...that's why, I was waiting not to interrupt you. I haven't written your name in that. -Is it very important? Give it to someone who comes to eat. What to tell? Getting arranged marriage. Writing the accounts everyday, hurts my hand. Hey, a bridegroom has been fixed for my uncle's daughter. Coming friday is the wedding. I know! Know it? How do you know? -Write it in his account. Okay, brother. The whole town knows. That’s right! I'll not come to office for two days, have lot of wedding work. Take care of the office. Hey, aren't you ashamed? They refused you the bride, then why do you go? Will he be forbidden from being my uncle, since he didn’t give his daughter. Dude, what? Okay, listen! Coming friday, my house is being auctioned… …I am going to Madurai to pay the money. So, you take care of the office. Better, let's declare holiday for office. The wedding is not so important to declare a holiday. We will declare for your wedding. Okay, leave that. For the auction, have you arranged the money or shall I arrange? Dad has arranged the money. I have to pay the money and get the documents. Okay. This was from Ramesh agency, Check it. Finally, he gave it. I thought of banging him and get the money. Good, he escaped. Is it a must to attend the wedding? You said not to go. Hello! Ashok, I'm Kavya! Hey, why are you calling late night? An important message. What's that important message? Today is your wedding, right? Yes, I am confused. I need to talk to you. Can you come home? Now? Yes, now. Will you come soon, please? Should I come now, definitely? -Yes! Only you can help me. Come, please. Okay, I will come. Dad! Hey, where did Ashok go? He isn't attending the call. Why? what happened, dad? The house will be auctioned, need to pay money at the bank. I'm held up in auditing. I trusted him. But, as usual he betrayed me. I too called him, he didn’t attend. Dad, don’t worry. I'll pay the money at bank. We will check with him, once he is back. Okay, go home and get the money from mom. Ensure to pay the money by 10 to 10.15 AM… …or else house will be auctioned. Okay? Dad, you don’t get tensed. I will pay the money and get the documents. Okay. Kavya! what happened? I’m not interested in this marriage. Hey, you're saying it in the last minute! Till yesterday, what where you doing? I was thinking! Thinking? Then, tell your parents. If I can tell them, why should I call you? What to do, now? I don’t know, but I don’t want this marriage to happen. Will you marry Anand? Hey, think well and tell me. Have you decided? Okay, then come. let’s go. Wedding is about to happen. How to come? Then, finish the wedding and come. Not that! If my dad knows I was eloped, he'll feel humiliated. I am thinking about it. The wedding has to be stopped, and it shouldn't be like you've eloped. Let's do one thing. It'll be a humiliation to your dad, if you're eloped. I will abduct you and get you married to Anand. I can’t lift you. I’ll take you along and get you married. Come on! Wonder, what's going to happen! Aunty, how are you? Keep it in the ear. Go... -You naughty! Who is he? Will he be the groom's relative? Be careful! Make sure no one notices you. Hey, that’s a cupboard. Why they've blocked the passage? Go this way. -Oh, I went the wrong way! Hey, who are you? I don't know, ask her. Who is he? I don’t know! Then, why do you go with him? He is hauling me. Hey, who are you? Who are you? I'm bridegroom’s brother! Hey, I was searching for you. Why did you hit him? If I hit him, It'll be like I'm hauling you. Else, it will reflect like you're eloping with me. Come on. Come on. Hey, where are you taking the girl? Who are you? Hey, where are you taking her? Hey, someone is fleeing with our girl. Catch him. Hey, come. -Go fast. Don’t allow them to escape. Don’t leave them. Hey, stop. Oh, no! Hey, start the vehicle. Go fast! Faster! Start the vehicle. Get in. Go fast Hey, go faster! Don’t leave him. Go fast. I am scared, get back me to home, please. What? do you want to get back to home? Will you keep changing your decisions? No, looking all these, I'm scared. Scared? Okay, I'll leave you in your home. Will you marry that wastrel? No! No decision can be made by relying on these girls. It’s over! Hey, go fast and smash him. Hey, wait! Where are you leaving, urgently? Hey, what? Why Ashok did like this? What he did? He halted your uncle’s daughter marriage and eloped with her. Why are you blabbering? He will not do it. Who is blabbering! The whole town is chasing him. The local channel is telecasting it 'LIVE'. If you don’t believe, call and ask him. Google, call Anand! I'm telling you, he has eloped with her, you're picking up the phone, very casually. Hey, wait. He’s calling me. Hey, where are you? Is my uncle’s daughter with you? Yes, she is with me. You buy a garland and mangalsutra and come to Athangudi Murugan temple, immediately. Hey, why are you saying now? Can't you tell me, earlier? She told me only today morning. Then, how can I tell you before? Hey, you buy the garland and mangalsutra and come soon. Hey, dad has asked me to pay the money at bank. You take your time, pay the money and come. By that time, they will dump me in a coffin. Hey, come soon. I'm being chased. What did he say? Asked to buy a garland and mangalsutra and come soon. Great! he abducted your uncle’s daughter and made you a middleman. Dangerous stance, what can I do? Shut up and hop on the bike. Where? I’m not coming. Don’t indulge me in fight. Then, the problem will be intense. Hey, there he comes! Go, stop him! Go! Anand, I had a doubt , when he said the phone call was personal. Now, why are you going around the temple? For all the sin I did. I've asked Anand to come here, Till he arrives, I've to go around. Don't your relatives have sense? Since, I'm going around the temple, they are also following me. Stupid guys! Not dare enough to come front and catch me. Oh, my goddess! No, uncle! Uncle, I came to see around the temple. Don’t hit me. Fast! Go away! Too much of dust! Hey, excellent! Everything is over. Hey, come on. If I thump you, you can't even breathe. Hey, what have you done? Don’t have time to tell now. Have you brought the garland and mangalsutra? Give me. Take it. -Give me. Why are you standing away? Come on. Wonder, where it will end! You come, first. -Wait, I'll come. Hey, where is the mangalsutra? Give me the mangalsutra. -Hey, bottle. If said all of a sudden, shouldn't we buy? Congratulations! -Why do you shake hands with me? Kavya, come this side. Hold it. Hey, hold this. Come this side. What are you looking at? Exchange the garlands. For whom is the marriage? -Why should I exchange the garlands? Hey, instead of you, who will garland your uncle’s daughter? Exchange the garlands. Hey, why are you blabbering! Hey, who is blabbering? For your sake, I took this risk and brought her here. Exchange the garlands. Who told you to bring her, without asking me? All of you yelled at me that I stopped the engagement. That’s why, I convinced her and brought here. Hey, uncle! Why are you silent? Tell him. He did all these for your sake. Tie the mangalsutra, now. Let's talk later. Later, you pardon me. For what? -I'll tell you later. Why, does he talk, ignorantly? Keep quiet. Hey, if mom and uncle know about this, what will they do? They will bless you both. You don’t get tensed. Like you were afraid in your house, he is afraid now. He will understand if I say! She came out of the house, trusting my word. Please, listen to me. Tie the mangalsutra. You're talking without understanding. What didn’t I understand? Hey, if your engagement had not stopped, you would’ve married Kavya, right? That’s what, I'm saying now. Hey, the stance on that day and now, is different. Please, understand. What to understand? Hey, Kavya is not a stranger. But, your uncle’s daughter. Whatever problem arises, it'll get settle in few days. If there is any further issues, Then, I'll ask apologies to each one of them at their feet. I plead you, tie the mangalsutra. -I can’t! Hey, can’t he understand? Repeating the same though I say, I can't. You’re talking without understanding the situation. Think of that girl's situation. Tie the mangalsutra, immediately. Hey, tie up! I'll listen to whatever you say, but I can’t get married. You're saying, you'll listen to whatever we say. But, you're not tying the mangalsutra. If you don’t have interest to marry me, why did you send the poetry and chain? What? Chain and poetry! Oh, this too? I didn’t give anything, Kavya! I swear, I don’t know anything about it. Look here, having authority on you, I did few things without asking you and without your knowledge. That’s not important now. I plead you to tie the mangalsutra. Go away! You're talking without understanding my situation. Hey, Kavya Just a minute. Hey, I’m asking you for the last time. If you're my friend, tie her the mangalsutra. If not, we don’t have any relationship. Can you do it or not? I can’t! Good! both of you keep fighting, I'll stand in the street. Is my life meant for you to play? Now, what should I do? Hey, idiots! do you have sense? Is a girl's life, a fun for you? I understand your situation well. Still, there is half an hour for the auspicious time to end. I'll drop you in the bus depot. If you take a bus, you'll reach the wedding hall in ten minutes. Get married to the bridegroom already fixed and live happily. Dude, is that fine? Is it okay for you? My good time, I was about to tell this. I got escaped. Dude, she slapped me. -Come, my dear. She is not Kavya! She is Kanchana! No one should marry her. They've come. -Then, they ought to come. You eloped with him on your wedding. Did you at least think of your father's honour? Sir, nothing fault on your daughter. I've forced and brought her. How dare will you take my daughter? -Hey, who are you hitting? Hey, hold him. Ashok! Uncle! -Leave him. Take away your hand. -Why are you pushing me? Why are you hindering them? You didn't listen me, isn't it? Though they thrash or lynch me, you shouldn't ask. We aren't related in any way. Sir, you haven't agreed your daughter's marriage with him because of me. That's why, I thought of bringing your daughter and get him married. But, he esteemed the relationship than the friendship. He said, uncle's dignity is more important... ...and refused to tie the mangalsutra. I'm solely responsible for all the confusions occured today. Punish me as you wish. Hey, even if I kill you, will I get back my lost honour? You know, it won't come back. Then, why all are hitting him? Shut your mouth. What are you looking at? Thrash him. No! -It hurts. Uncle, tell not to hit him. He did by mistake, uncle. Please, uncle. Hit him. -Wait. Uncle, tell not to hit him. Please, uncle. -Leave him. Thank you, uncle. Bring my daughter. Wonder, this has happened to you! Your father thought, everyone should praise your wedding. It's your fate. -It turned worst. You should've luck. Dude, they've hurt your mouth. Will they kiss me? Oh, no! He is calling. I forgot to pay the money in the bank. Will you give this to Ashok's father? Oh, gosh! to him? Better to get thumped by your uncle but don't send me to him. He will kill me with his words I may accompany you for being your friend. Come on. -Come. I expected this. Take it. Why did you bring this now? You have it. The house will be auctioned if we don't pay the money? How many times I told you? He said, he went to abduct the girl for your sake. Your relatives came here and creating ruckus. What are you thinking? Did I ask you? Did I ask you to get money from my house and pay in the bank? It's okay if you don't help but why are you creating issues? Hey, if you've dignity and honor, don't come to my house. You will be ashamed. Henceforth, if your son comes home, I'll become a murderer. Gone! Everything has gone! The house where I was born and brought up was lost... ...because of trusting these stupids. Stay blessed. We are surviving with this mouth. They hurt it, exactly. It's better for you. I can't hear after he hit me. Hey! Dude! -Ashok! Appachi, lend me fifty rupees. I'll give back, tomorrow. It's sixty six thousand rupees. Take it. -Check it. Ashok! You check it. -Ashok! Hey, you... Sorry, brother! -Ashok! What's this? Why is he doing this, Appachi? -He is leaving with enrage. Tell me the side platters. Shall I tell peas and nuts? -Damn it. It's been a long time since I ate non vegetarian food. Hold him strongly. Look now. Chicken pepper, mutton chukka, prawns gravy... Hey...not all those. Give me two boiled eggs. Is boiled egg, non vegetarian food? This is why, we shouldn't booze with oldeys. Here is the boiled eggs. All of you take the boiled eggs. All of us? Did I keep any of my photos in my shop? Let's do it, soon. It's all your photos. Did you think of the reason? If your photo is kept no one will come to the shop. Hey... -Tell me. Your friendship! -Cheers! If I see your photo, I remember only your friendship. Did I say that I'll transfer the ownership to you... ...thinking, you'll become business magnets? I said just for your friendship. Am I blabbering in high, craving for friendship like you. Appachi, why are you emotional now? Look Anand, always Ashok will be at fault. But, this time the fault is your's. Appachi, Anand is there. -Have they changed? Don't I know? -You know! Both of them are same for me. Like my two eyes. Look, how he managed. We all poked him that day. That's why, he brought your uncle's daughter. What should've you done? -What he should've done? You'd have tied the mangalsutra. -Yes, you'd have tied. That's the mark of friendship. -Yeah, it's right! Appachi, you too talk without understanding my stance. What's your stance? Don't we have stance? Does he only have stance? Talking useless. Appachi, I'm getting furious. I'll leave. -Hey, sit down. Sit down. We are more furious people than you, but sitting quiet. He said it. He didn't esteem the friendship as I did. Not like that, Appachi. I'll give my life for his sake. I might yell at you. Ask him to tell, at least one right thing which happened on that day. I'll obey you, whatever it is. What? It's over. Sofia has come back. Who is Sofia? Hello! -Speak properly. What about the interview? Six months training at Noida. Later, the posting will be somewhere at North India. So, I denied it. Hey, you took up coaching sessions for this bank job, isn't it? When did I went for coaching session? Then? I came to meet you with that as the reason. Oh, no! Okay, I'll come and meet your dad. It'll be a issue if we belong to different caste. We belong to different religions. Definitely, they will not accept. Look here, listen to me carefully. We both need to change our religions. I'll come to your house and say, 'your son-in-law is a Christian... ...but not your daughter'. You come to my house and say, 'your daughter-in-law is a Hindu... ...but not your son'. All the problems will get solved. You... Why are you staring me? Watched 'Poove unakkaga' film and telling me the story. Don't take it just as a film, the notion will work. You can convert to other religion but how about the caste? If you ask questions like this, I'll jump down. Better jump. No one has answers for these questions. Let me think. No need to think. Okay. Listen to what I say. After coming back from church on Sunday... ... my dad will be in a good mood to some extent. You come and talk, then. I will tell you right away... He will shout to the core. -It's okay. There are chances to yell at you. -I'll accept it. There are chances he might ask you to convert as a Christian. That's all? If your dad agrees, I'll become a father too. Hey, how will you marry me if you become a father? You goof. Not the father of Church... I said, we will get married and become father of our child. "The day I saw you..." "The day I saw myself in life" "Like the drizzles on my window, You stood and went away" "What could I do?" "You're killing me with caressing words" "Who are you, Sofia?" "Are you the selfie of a pine tree flower?" "You're the mafia of the mind" "Would you say a little?" "Who are you, Sofia?" "Are you the selfie of a pine tree flower?" "You're the mafia of the mind" "Would you say a little?" What do you want, uncle? The sister in the opposite house should come out, right? Yes, I'm waiting since morning. But can't see her, yet. Okay, hold this bottle. If I hold this, will she come out? -She will come. Don't hold it, straight. Hold it, slantingly. Slanting? Is this enough? Why are you taking the rocket? Why are you keeping it in the bottle? Hey, why are you lighting it? Hey! It's over! Oh, no! Grandpa! Anand uncle has broken the window glass of opposite house. Oh, gosh! Why did you break the window glass of opposite house? Hey, I didn't do. The junior Ashok did it. He ran away. Oh, no! They're coming along with the family. You idiots! -Oh, gosh! Will you fire the rocket inside the house? Sorry, sir. The address has been changed. If it fell on us? -Your mouth would've been torn. What? -Nothing, uncle. You go, uncle. -You go, sir. Hereafter, the rocket will not come. It's over. -Get in. Why are you bursting crackers for love? -Uncle. 'Happy Diwali'. Wastrel.

You will miss me for ten days. Is it a issue? Give your phone. I'll set my photo as wallpaper. Shame! Good, no one has seen. -I saw you. Take it. Be quiet, uncle. Sofia said she will come. I don't know how I would be without seeing her for ten days. It's the national meet. Go happily. Good... Uncle, don't interfere. Be silent. You can speak with Sofia on phone. You leave. Go, dude. -You leave. Look him, uncle. He is not going. Go. I will miss you too. -It's okay. We know who will you miss! Go. Dude, win the match. Go soon. Good, you're late by five minutes. -Why? He wouldn't have gone if he had seen you. Leave it, no problem. He will be back in ten days. You can speak to him on phone. Don't be emotional. He left but who is she smiling at? I told you not to get emotional. I didn't tell you to smile. Why are you smiling? He has come. Everything has gone. He came to buy a water bottle. Did you think I left? You said, it's a national meet. That's not important to me than meeting you. Just ten days, you should've gone. I can't stay even a day without seeing you.

From my college days. Why? Have you ever proposed me? -Propose? See tomorrow. Sir, I'm coming in ten minutes. On the way, sir. Okay, sir. Hey, where did you keep the bike keys? I'm getting it. You kept here and searching there. Take it. -Give me. You need a person to get the keys. Oh, god! Oh, no! Dear, have some water. Come in. I'm going in hurry. You want to me to have water. Why are you in hurry? Can't you go, patiently. Always in hurry. Whose car is this? -This is the last ball. Damn it. How many times to say... ...not to park the car at the entrance of the house? Should I wait for them, each and every time I go out? Whose car is this? -it's the opposite house car, grandpa. Call them. Uncle, my grandpa is calling you. Dear, be patient. -Uncle, my grandpa is calling. They will take it. He parked at the entrance, boldly. You want me to be patient. Get lost. Dear, don't shout on the road. Hey, whose car is this? If you park like this, how should we come out of the house? Should we break the car and come? Sorry, sir! Another vehicle was there at front. That's why... Do you've sense? Take the vehicle soon. He said he will take the vehicle. Why are you talking about sense and all. Don't shout. -I have kept a 'No parking' board. I told you many times not to park the vehicle there. Still you do it, I can ask whether you've sense? Can I come and say all your guests not to park the vehicle? First, you should have sense. If you talk anything more, you'll be disgraced. Dad! Shut up. What? What's your problem? If given respect, you're talking too much. Was the vehicle parked inside your house? It's parked on the road. Get lost. We can't take, get lost. Hey, what's your age and mine? You're talking disrespectfully. Oh, no! Dear! Oh, Dad! Dad! Get up. What happened, dad? Anand, thrash him. What happened, mom? They've parked the vehicle at the entrance of the house. Dad told them to take it. For that, they hit him and pushed down. Why? Hey, take him. Don't create ruckus before my house. I'll bang you. -Hey, keep quiet. Will you bang? Do it, let me see. Hey! Alex! Oh, no! Alex! Oh, no! Don't want. Leave him. Listen to me. Leave me. I said, leave me. Whom are you hitting? Get lost! Alex! I told you not to create problem. -Leave him. You go, sir. Leave him. -Leave me, sir. Dad! Dear! Dear! Dad! Dear! Oh, no! Dad! Slowly! Get up, slowly. Give the hand. Be careful. Just a car parking issue. You had hit him for that. My dad doesn't have sense but what about you? They hit dad and pushed him down. He tells to hit them back. What can I do? It's okay, you had hit Sofia's brother. But, why did you hit her father? I didn't hit him. He came to hit me, I just hindered. He slipped and fell down. -Hindered him? Like Mike Tyson, you kicked him and pushed in the drainage. Talks are going on so. What? They are telling lies. I didn't hit him. He fell on his own. Yeah, that's a big swimming pool. He has fell into that, willingly. Doing everything and talking too. -Look at him and his trousers! What to do now? Did you speak to Sofia? I called her, she isn't attending. Did she speak to you? Hey, idiot! She didn't attend when I called her. Then, how will she speak to me? That's all. -'That's all', means? That means, 'that's all'. Will any problem arise for my love because of this? How it will arise? It'll arise only if there is anything. Better, join my WhatsApp group, Virgin. Hey, uncle! Be quiet. He is already tensed. Iritating him saying WhatsApp. Shall I go to their house and ask for apology? He will not let you inside the house. Have to take some elder person and talk, tomorrow. Ashok, I'm here, right? He will not let him in the house. But, you'll not be allowed even in the street. Do you know one thing? Sofia's father and my brother studied together. He likes me a lot. I was chubby and cute in my childhood. He'll caress me. Shit. You're an unlucky fellow. He will feel all alone. Keeping the hands on head.. -Go... Sir! Come in. Have you come to hit me as what your friend did isn't enough? Sir, I came to apologize. Come inside. -It's stinks. Be seated. Sit down. Why does it stinks? Is the drainage clogged? Hey, uncle. Sir! The stinking smell is on me. Your friend Anand did this. Are you better now, brother? Nothing for me. Alex had a fracture in hand. Unnecessaril, he got furious. But Puli, I'll file a case and imprison him. Brother, it happened by mistake. Don't take it to the heart. He said he will come to ask apology. But, we said we'll talk to you. He is acting, Puli. He is a wastrel. Don't say like that, brother. Not like that, sir. He is a good guy. How many years have we been in the opposite house? Has any problem emerged? -Not that... Always, he has an eye on my house. The reason is your daughter. He will ever stare here. Some people don't like Christians. He is of that category. Oh, Jesus! -You speak! What? -Nothing. -Nothing. Sir, he has done this to you because of his affection for my father. No. Earlier, he fired the rocket and smashed the glass window. You had escaped on that day. Yesterday, he hit us using this parking issue. I'll forgive even your father. We both are elders and indulged in fight. Who is he to hit us? That's why, I'm saying. He did this, intentionally. Sir! Be quiet. Sir, he didn't do intentionally. You're the father of his lovelady. Why should he hit you intentionally? What? Be louder. He didn't hear it seems. Sir, Sofia and Anand are in love. Sir, we thought of telling you this week. But, this has happened. Get up! Am I looking like a dump head? -Lightly. That scoundrel had hit me, without respecting my age. My son had a fracture and I'm suffering. At this moment, how dare you talk about his love? I let you into the house, because you wish to apologize. Get out. I know when and to whom should my daughter get married. Get lost. Come, let's go before he blasts. Go in. He says to go in and out. It's not wrong to push him into the drain. Hey, you said you were chubby and he will caress you. What happened now? He behaved badly because of stenchy smell. Else, he is fond of me. Today, his mood has changed. Yes, he will caress. He left you without thumping. -Will he thump me? I shouldn't bend before him. So many things has happened? Okay, she got married. Then? On that day, I went to Ashok's house to get the money. I saw Sofia, again. Mom, Sofia is here! Pity on Sofia! She got married, isn't it? Her husband died in a flight accident. After that, she came here. Her life ruined. Thinking, Sofia is living happily, somewhere... ...I changed my mind and agreed to get married. If I wouldn't have seen her, I would've listened to what he said. After seeing her in that stance, I couldn't think about my life. Now tell me, Appachi. What I did is wrong? What you did is not wrong. Appachi! Welcome! It's a wonder! You've come. Are you doing good? -Yeah, I'm good. He is our guy Anand. -I know him. The Captain of the Kabaddi team. -Yes. You played here four years before. Do you remember? -Yes. Till now, our guys utter only your name. Be seated. Appachi, what's the matter? Last week, you bought an house in auction, didn't you? Yes, to the back of the temple. Any problem in that? No problem. That's the house of the guy known to me. Okay. He had arranged the money on that day. A small problem has occured. Meanwhile, you bought the house in auction. Is it? That's his ancestral house. He feels bad as it was lost. Is it your's, dude? -No, it's Ashok's house. You mean the defence player? -Yes, brother. He is a good player. He won the Kabaddi match and lost the house. You shouldn't mistake us. We are ready to give a better amount than you expect. It'll be good if you give us the house. We will never forget your help. Is it? Okay, Appachi. You say it's the ancestral house. You take it. I don't want profit. It's enough if you give me the amount for which I bought. But, you should do me a favour. Tell us, brother. -That's nothing, dude. I'm passionate of Kabaddi since my childhood and I've a team. But I can't win the cup for ten years. It's a regret for me. Every year we prepare the team, strongly. But, the opposite team will be more stronger than us and wins the cup. Each and every time we reach up to finale and lose. This has become routine. It's very humiliating, Appachi. So, you and Ashok should play for my team and win the cup. Will you do? That's all? You're doing a great help. What work they have other than this? What Anand? -Yeah, we will play. Then, what? Anand has said. Your team will win and get the cup, this year. Not that, Appachi. You don't know about the opposite team. If they're aware that these guys are playing, they will do anything to win. You don't know about our guys. No one can do anything either on or off the ground. The cup is for you. I assure you. That's enough, Appachi. Hey, Palani! -Brother! Bring the document. Here is the document of your house. We've redeemed it. Where did you go for two days? You shouted at Anand, on that day. Did he utter any word against you? You lost your house, on that day. And you got it back, now. But, he lost his life because of you. Can you give him back? Did he lose his life because of me? What is he saying? Yeah, what are you saying? Yes, he was in love with Sofia, his opposite house girl. Sofia? He hit her father for your words. Because of him, they got her married to someone. Both Ashok's and the girl's lives are gone. But till this day, has he ever said... ... his life has gone because of my father? Some mistake has happened. So, will you yell at him and throw him out of the house? Henceforth, he will not come even if you plead. I too will not come. You stay in the house. The one who got scoldings is eating, inside. What's his problem? Is he eating? Oh, no! Why did he come now? Come and have food. Hey, I was talking for you. You're eating without shame. Will you get food if you feel shame? Leave it. Dad only scolded me. Okay, come. I won’t give. Hey, uncle! Don't you have sense? Nothing like that is served. Serve my gravy. That means? -Tamarind gravy. He will speak like a scientist. Serve it. Pour on his head. It's good to die instead of eating like this. Give me some. Look him. For this life... -Is it Ponni rice? Aren't you ashamed? It's been four days since I ate. -In this house, right? Serve me tamarind gravy. She will serve. Don't hurry. Hello! Echo is heard. The tank is dredged. Hey, bottle! -Tell me. Hey! Oh, no! Why is she here? Should she stop here? In this bike, the tyre... Hi! Are you doing good? I was good, until seeing you. The day I saw you, I lost my life. Happy! Wait. Where are you leaving? Just a jolly ride on bike... Good, you had ruined my life and roaming happily. Hey! Did I ruin? -Yes, that's what your job is. Saying something and spoiling the good girl. Don't utter the words spoil and ruin, being on the road. Don't the people who heed you will mistake me? What's there to mistake, still? Everything is over. Nothing is over. I tried to do a good deed and it turned bad. Even now, I think I have to do something to you. Tell me, if you're in love with someone. I'll help you. Don't you've any other work? What should I do, now? -You have to love. Whom? -Me. Don't you've any other work? Are the existing problems not enough? Look here. I don't love you for being nice and talking well. Then for what? For the work you did... ...some other girl would've thrown acid on your face. But, I understood that you've done all these for the sake of friendship. Not only that, on that day, it was I who came with you... ...from the house denying the marriage. You took the blame on you and got hit. First, I made a decision, said by my father. Later, I made a decision, said by you. Both went wrong. It's you who said on that day... Whatever others say, we must decide with whom should we live. When thinking of it, I know only you. I saw only your kind heart. So, I decided to love you. You think well and tell your decision tomorrow. Hey, look here. You're trying to speak like me and confusing me. Not only now, whenever I say, my decision is the same. I can't love you. Then, say it tomorrow. It's the same even if I say tomorrow. Say it, tomorrow. Why are you leaving the bike? Fuel dried up. -Shall I drop you? No need. Following a style even when sleeping. He isn't attending the phone... Ashok, I'm Sofia speaking. I want to talk with you. Will you come to the temple on the mountain without informing Anand? Okay, I'll tell Ashok. Will your girlfriend talk only at the temple on the mountain? Whatever! Ashok, his mother came to my house. Why? What's the matter? I'll come straight away to the matter. My son has been denying the marriage for two years... ...thinking of your daughter. Now, we've spoke to him to our best and convinced for marriage. We're looking for a bride too. As your daughter came back, again he started denying marriage. I have only son. Don't I wish to get him married? Look here, don't mistake me. If I buy something in my house, I'll buy new stuff. Else, I'll not buy. When that's the case, I don't have the mindset of getting my son married to a girl... ... who was married, already. Pardone me. My daughter haven't disturbed your son. She didn't even look at him. If you want to convey anything, tell your son. Already, we're badly hurt. Don't bother us, more. Get your son married to whoever you want. You can leave. My son will not get marry until you're in this town. Think well. For that sake, does she want you to leave this town? What she said is right. If it's a city like Chennai... ...no one will bother, what's happening in the next house. In our hometown, everyone knows whatever happens in our house. Who will wish her son to get married to a woman who was married, already? I've come to my father's house to feel little relieved. Where do I go if it bothers me here too? What should I do now? Tell him to marry someone as his mother says. Look here, my mother has no rights to tell you to leave this town. The same way, you don't have any rights to tell me to get marry. Just answer to my query. Would you leave me alone in this situation if I were you? That's why, I said I'll not talk with him. Sofia, reply me. Will you leave me alone? That's different and this is different. We both aren't the same. What's different? The happiness and sadness are the same for both men and women. What now? I shouldn't come behind you, right? I swear, I'll not come. But no matter how many years, Whoever leaves you, I'll be there for you. I'm the only one for you. Ashok, that's why I called you and told I want to speak with you alone. You called me but you said to him. You are his friend, right? He is blabbering. Instead of getting him married to a good girl... ... you're dancing to his tunes. If the parents look for a bride, they will bother about others. I'm his friend. I'll look for what he likes. You're his only girl in this world! What can I do for it? Sofia! Did she bring us to the mountain to say this? Why did you come here? To talk with you. I told you yesterday, l can't love you. What's the meaning for denying me? I told you many reasons why I like you. You just tell me one reason for not liking me. Not one, I've many reasons. First, you were the bride fixed for Anand. Saying, I fell in love with my friend's bride... ...everyone will yell at me. Your relatives are furious on me. It'll be a problem if they witness both of us talking. You come this side. The friendship between me and Anand will be ruined. That's all? That's all for now. Look here, Anand didn't love me and so I. It's meaningful of your thinking, if we had fallen in love with each other. But, the first point you said is damn cheap. What did you say? You mean, problems will arise. If you're afraid of problems, As soon as I called... ...you wouldn't have come to my house and took me. You said something else... Because of love, your friendship will be ruined. True friendship will support the love. Still you said one more.. As you fell in love with your friend's girlfriend... ...everyone will yell at you. That's the only fact you said. What's the fact? I didn't do anything. You didn't do deliberately. But, it's like that. Like that means... Who kept the flex for my birthday and gave me a chain? That's for the sake of Anand. You've sent poetry in WhatsApp, with me in your mind, isn't it? Who wrote poetry thinking of you? I took that from Facebook. Whatever I say, you'll manage by your smart talk. I'm not here to argue. Take this. What's this? It's the chain you gave. Bought it for your birthday, you keep it. It's not given by Anand. You gave this chain. If you say , you love me, I'll have it. Else, why should I have someone's chain? Tell me. Give me, I'll have it. Ashok, don't think just because I returned the chain, Sorry, as you got it back, don't think everything is over. Even if you don't think of me, I'll think of you. I'm the reason for your stance. Whatever happened, I should've got you married. I don't want your mercy. I've many people. Instead of thinking the past, take care of your life. "Why are you refusing?" "You too will get it " "You're hiding, But, you think of me" "Something painful Rubs my mind, lightly" "To walk away from you I could not do it..." "Say when it is, Like every other dawn" "Fragmented inside, You didn't seem to understand me" He likes me. -No, he likes me. Will you like me or Kavya? Tell me. -Even if you don't think of me, I'll think about you. I don't like you both. Get lost! We too don't like you. Go away. Damn it, we asked you! "Whichever bird crosses me, that's your parody" "What would I do without you?" -Have you ever proposed me? "The words you and I said, Not even one was lost" "I saved the wind in the house" I can't stay even a day without seeing you. "The old days are killing me little by little..." "Your visit is over my palm" "Joins like a little feather" "You made something within me" "Who forgets? Though aside, you're closer" "Tell me, what are you thinking to do, still?" "If you don't tell, you will lose your love" Hey, Kavya! What? I'm waiting for you. I know, tell me. Then, you are moving on. Stop me and say, if I go. Nothing wrong. Attitude. I didn't do anything to cheat you. Look here, I know all those. Tell me, what you want to say now? No, if I say all these, I can easily convey, what I want to. Okay, tell me, That is... When you came trusting me and was cheated, I was hesitant. When you conveyed your love, I don't know what to say. I was confused. I know well, you're coming around me. You might think, I'm showing attitude. Nothing like that. I was just wondering what the problems will be... ...if we both are together. How big a problem it would be for me, if we don't be together... ...It was only in these four days I realized, in your absence. Alright, so? I don't know to convey my love. So, you understand. So, that's all? How to say in temple? -This is how will you convey the love? You kept a flex on that day... That's a drama. I can do only this for true love. Then? My mom is waiting. I'm leaving. Are you happy? Past is past. Don't talk about it. It's good to proceed the marriage. In-law, I wanted to celebrate my daughter's wedding. But, something has happened. You find an auspicious day for the wedding, this time. Last time also, we've fixed an auspicious day. When elders are speaking, you're talking in between. As yours is an honourable and great family, I agreed for the wedding, immediately. It was ashame when the marriage was stopped on that day. Everyone was talking something. That's why, this marriage should happen. If there is fault on my daughter, I wouldn't have come to talk with you. Last time, some blind mistake has happened. It will not happen this time. If happened this time? More than my life, dignity is utmost important for me. If it happens this time, I'll not let anyone alive whoever is the reason for it... ... and I too will not be alive after losing my dignity. In-law, why are you talking, seriously? We will proceed the marriage, next week. Let's do the marriage in the house, very simple. Dad! What are you saying? Everyone knows that my marriage was stopped. Once again, the marriage should be known to everyone. Uncle! -Son-in-law! Do the marriage more grandeur than last time. Glad, son-in-law. Let's do it. Last time, I was little careless. I'll get my clan this time. You go, boldly. Nothing wrong will happen. I'll take care of that, son-in-law. I'm leaving, in-law. -Okay. How much gold is he giving for the bride? Five hundred sovereigns. Call him later and ask for thousand sovereigns. How is that possible? -Oh, no! The for what I told him, he must do it more grandeur this time. He will do. If the bride elopes the next time... ...shall we ask two thousand sovereigns of gold? Oh, god! -You idiot. Hey, what's this? He is going with our girl. She would've given him lift. Lift? He is leaning on her back. Is it lift? We would've finished him on the day the marriage was stopped. Tell now, let us finish. Just now, we went to the bridegroom's house. Having the marriage in a week, we shouldn't do all these. What to do him, now? Welcome, uncle. -Be seated, dude. It's okay, uncle. Be seated, son-in-law. Okay. You too sit down, dear. Dear, you know well about the stance that led to look for... ...a bridegroom out of the family for Kavya. I know well, brother. I longed, she must come to my house. That didn't happen. It will happen to whoever is gifted. Anand must be disappointed on me. Uncle, I forgot everything on that day. I was worried when Kavya's marriage was stopped because of me, last time. Yes, brother. It's enough if Kavya gets a good life. That's the wish of everyone. As nothing shouldn't happen like last time, Now. we are doing everything, carefully. What happened last time was an accident. Ashok did so, thinking he is doing me favour. This time, nothing will happen, uncle. I'll do this marriage. That's what I too want to say, son-in-law. I feel happy as you said on your own. I feel courageous, now. Put a word to Ashok also. -Uncle, I'll tell Ashok. Good, son-in-law. Son-in-law, if any problem arise in this marriage, I'll not be alive. Uncle, why are you getting emotional? This marriage will happen as you've planned. I'm responsible for that. Good, son-in-law. Okay. I won! Is he telling, really? Are you hiding any card? You keep on winning. Should I play, cheating you? Hereafter, I'll win. An attitude is visible in your talk. When it wasn't there? Today night is my treat. Treat? Where? Instead of asking why, he is asking where? He is ashaming us too. What's that query you ask, uncle? Okay, leave it. why? I'll tell after Anand arrives. -Then, he will not tell us. Your treat is okay. Win the Kabaddi match, tomorrow. I'll give you treat. You mean, the boiled egg? Hey, tomorrow is Saturday. Then, not that too. Come, Anand. We are waiting for you. I must talk about an important matter with you. Be seated, first. I must also talk about an important matter with you. What? He feels shy. Hey, you don't feel shy. I too feel shy. Please, tell us. I'm in love with a girl. Who is that girl? Kavya! Which Kavya? What, dude? Your uncle's daughter. Don't play. Making fun of everything. Hey, I'm telling you, seriously. We both are in love with each other. Hey, she is getting married next week. Just now, uncle came home and told us. What is he doing, Appachi? I swear, I'm not aware of it. Last time, Kavya's marriage was stopped because of us. My uncle was more humiliated. It wouldn't be good, if anything happens again. I promised him, I'll take care of this marriage. What are you talking? I said, we both are in love with each other. You talk about your word to uncle. Appachi, why is he talking without understanding? Look, I came upstairs to play cards. Both of you will fight and re-join. Why are you dragging me in this? You just gave him a word, right? Take it back. What are you talking without understanding anything? He is my maternal uncle. I've promised before the whole family. If anything happens in this marriage, it's a shame for me. How many times to ashame the bride's parents? Hey, I didn't do this, intentionally. She told, she loves me. I too like her. Leave all those. Leave her for my sake. Hey, it's love! Can you understand what I say? -I can understand well. You think only about yourself. Not thinking about those two families. How many times will the family of the bridegroom get ashamed? Upon humiliation, if my uncle does anything, what will you do? If Kavya does anything, what will you do? Her parents will take care of her. I can't be a spectator, thinking my lovelady... ... will be taken care by parents or others. The same way, I can't be quiet looking my uncle being humiliated. What will you do? Just now, both of you are exchanging the message. Why are you furious? Speak politely. Hey, bottle. Be quiet. When I abducted the girl for his sake, don't I know to abduct for me? Appachi, his way of talking isn't right. Ask him to leave from here. What did I say wrong? I'm talking in right sense. Whoever hinders, I'll abduct the girl... Will you abduct her over me? -I'll do. Hey, wait. Both of you speak politely. You are piling up the words. Appachi, ask them. Having the match tomorrow, why are you quarrelling? That's very important. Useless match. Anand, I gave word to Kasi before you. What to reply him, if he asks? Appachi, I must win the match, right? Whoever comes or not, I'll win the match. Oh, he will win? Who is he? -Anand! Hey, get lost. Call him. Anand! Anand! -He is making fun, now. Ashok! Dude! Appachi, stay quiet. Wonder, what will be the problem in today's marriage? Tonight is the Kabaddi match. He is enraged and standing here. Hey, you speak to him. Anand, there is no mistake on Ashok. Your uncle's daughter chased him and fell in love. He denied her. She spoke some logics, changed his mind and convinced him. Not only that, last time she came trusting him and was disappointed. How, if you don't understand? Why everyone is talking for him? When he asked me to buy the garland and mangalsutra... ...would I've asked him a word, that day? I bought on my own. You too yelled at him. Did I scold him? Please understand, if I'm talking against this love, today. You think only about yourselves. I'm thinking about the two families. Not that... Look here, if you wish we both should fight, you bring him to the wedding hall. Else, talk something and make him to sit there. Let's bring him. Uncle, don't go that way. His uncle will be sitting. Come on. Always going to eat as soon as you arrive. Are you fasting? On behalf of 'Ambal Kabaddi team', Owner of 'Power star team'... ... Power Pandi is honoured by cladding a shawl. 'Kasi Warriors team', plays today with Anand and Ashok as players. In opposite team, Ashok is not in the field. He shouldn't enter the town also. -I'll take care, dude. Because of Ashok's absence, Kasi brother feels panic. Offence king, Anand takes up the raid as first player. Though seven players are there in the opposite team, Anand will score points, cleverly. Kabaddi... Just now I said, he has scored the point. Lion cub. Hey! From 'Power Star team', the Tamil Nadu Police team Captain, Abdul will play now. Abdul will rock the game. Though Kasi brother's team is strong on offence... ... it's little weak on defence. A nice score by Abdul. Pandi brother laughs, cutely. Appachi, Ashok didn't come. Shall I call him? Will he come if you call? Wait, let me call. Hey, stop. Where are you going? To play the match, boss. What? For match? You've to play in your hometown. Why are you coming here? I'll play, everywhere. I'm in frustration. I warn you to leave the way. He is frustrated! First, play with us. Then, you can go to the town and play. I think, he is coming by bike. That's why not attending the call. He'll come. Chinna thambi from Sellur is coming to the field, majestically. He can't be tackled even by Bahubali. He has dragged everyone. Kasi, you said, two people will come and win the cup. One of them is not seen in the field. Did he flee out of fear? Hey, be quiet. He will come. Kasi brother's team is losing the points. Though the offence is strong, defence is weak. Appachi, if we lose this time, I'll lose my honour. Can't live in the hometown with dignity. Don't talk inauspiciously. Somehow, Ashok will come. He is a playful guy. But will not take for granted. It's said, the match is between the 'Kasi team' and 'Power Pandi' team. But Anand alone is playing against the 'Power Pandi team'. We had never seen Anand playing so furiously. Single handedly, he is recovering the lost points. Anand is the only challenge for 'Power Pandi team' to win. They're playing madly to catch Anand. Kabaddi... Don't know whether they're playing Kabbadi or bull baiting. They are playing like catching a bull. They've tackled him. Kabaddi... I expected! The Power team has shown their damn job. First aid, check what happened to the player. Oh, no! Go soon. Bring him aside. Intentionally, they are playing foul. Wow! Already defence is weak. Now, the offence has become weak. Everything is over. Kasi brother's team is tumbling like pack of cards. As usual, Kasi brother's team is getting defeated and losing the points. The time is going on. Kasi, don't worry. Ashok will come. The first half is going to end. What to do, if he comes hereafter? Appachi, why did I give you the document without taking money? Because of the trust I had on you. Did you keep up that? Appachi, you've strangled me for trusting you. Kasi... The 'Power Pandi team' is leading in first half of the match. Half time. Side change. Ashok, who was expected by all has entered the field. First time, we're watching Ashok and Anand playing in the same team. How did he come? If you're dare enough, Play against them. There is no player for defence. This time also we will lose the cup. Brother, what are you doing here? -What? Ashok came. The Pandi team is panicking and struggling to play. What are you saying? When thinking everything is over, the game begins now. Come on, boys! Excellent! Appachi, are they rocking? Go aside. -Okay, leave it.. You provoked Anand, isn't it? Meet his toughness. This is what comeback is! Look, how he has settled the score? Kabaddi... Excellent! The Power Pandi team played the first half of the match on the ground. Now, swaying on air in the second half. Only now, the match is furious. The 'Power Pandi team' has lost the power. Power Pandi brother's face was flattened. Abdul, the 'star of hope' of 'Power Pandi team' is taking the raid. Let's see, whether he scores or not. If Abdul is lifted, the 'Power Pandi team' will lose on the whole. They did it before I finished. The match is over. As no one expected, like England won the cup... ...for the first time, Kasi brother's team has won the cup. They've rocked it, Appachi. Excellent! We have won the match! We have won the cup! Excellent! -Everyone has played well. Appachi, thank you very much. You got me the cup. You've hurt me by words. Can you take those words back? It's my mistake. Forgive me, Appachi. Was there any day where you both didn't fight from your childhood? If someone steps to convince you, both of you together... ...will make him to run away. I've seen you both like that from your childhood. Has he drunk? Ashok, I know you will come. But, I got panicked, today. Appachi, I came not to let others win over my ancestral house. I'm leaving. Hey! Ashok! Hey! -He has left! Where is Anand? -He too left! They left half an hour before. Come, let's go home, booze and sleep. -That's also right. Come on, Appachi. Many vehicles are coming! Brother, who are these people? Dude, all belong to our clan. -Get down. Take your things. Uncle, why are these people coming? Son-in-law, Ashok can be your friend. But, he is not good like you. He might do anything to stop this marriage. I'm here, uncle. I'll take care. Not that, son-in-law. It shouldn't happen like last time. We too should be ready for everything. Greetings, sir! -Welcome, dude. Greetings, brother. Looks terrific. Kavya, I don't bother who is there with your father. Tomorrow, whatever problem arises, I'll take care. It's not like last time. Anand too is supporting my father. I'm very much afraid. Whoever hinders, I'll come to the marriage hall, tomorrow. Your marriage will happen with me. Go and sleep. Dear, give me the phone. Dad! Give it. That is... Take back after the marriage. Hey, break that phone. As my uncle wished, it's enough if the marriage happens well. Anand, Ashok has come. How many have accompanied him? He came alone. -Alone? Hey, come on. Move away. Brother, stop. Why have you come here? It's not important to do the marriage, grandeur. Without the willing of the bride, you shouldn't do the marriage. We too know that. We are doing this marriage on the willingness of the bride. Go and look after your work. You shouldn't say that. Let Kavya say it. I'm telling you... Hey, he is saying... But, you're going inside. Go out. I'll take care. -Why are you sprinkling rose water? Anand, he has come to create issue in the marriage. Don't let him inside. Hey, leave. Wait, I said I'll speak to him. Why are you staring? Anand, he is nothing. I'm considering for your sake. Ask him to leave. I'll talk to him. Leave it. Dude, he must be banged... I'm telling you.... Stop it. For his sake, you're banging our guys. He is watching it. Can we fight among ourselves for someone else? I told them not to touch him. They aren't listening me. Good! It's good that your uncle trusted you and you're doing this. Did he trust me? He never trusted me. I was brought up before him. On that day, when his elder son-in-law said something wrong about me... ...He didn't trust me and denied my marriage. Even that's okay. Today, though I said, he brought a clan. Is this the trust he has on me? Do you think he has come alone? He came with confidence that I'm here. I don't know what he do is right or wrong. No body should touch him in my presence. I'll not let anyone to touch. What are you talking? It's just a friendship. But, we are your kith and kin. Is he important than us? If we get married within families, everyone will become relatives. Whatever you do, the relatives can't be friends. What's the need to talk with him? Thrash him and throw out. Anand! What did you say? Am I watching? I'll be a spectator when he hits others. If you hit him, I'll not be a spectator. Are we sitting here not knowing to go? That's it. -They are his kith and kin. Today, he had hit them. That is friendship! -I don't understand. You will never understand. You should've been as a true friend with someone in your life to understand it. Is it sweet? -No, poison. I've seen people humiliated by the halted marriage. Just now saw who ask for extra gold. I'll talk. Be patient. Forgive me, uncle. Don't mistake me as I say this. Giving thousand sovereigns of gold and getting her married to a wastrel, You no need to do anything and if you send Kavya... ...my friend will take care of her like a Queen. Though he knows this clan is here, he came alone for Kavya. He will look after her, well. Not only that, even Kavya likes him. Co-operate uncle. -Please, uncle. Let them both be together, uncle. - Co-operate. Go and fall on his foot, immediately. Go and fall. Fall on his foot. The day when Anand told Ashok not to love Kavya, I know well, Anand will do their marriage. Because, their history is like so! Everything got over well. Then, why are they roaming in the company jeep? Hey, be careful. Who is that? Crossing over... Have you started? Are you sacrificing your life for the goodness of Anand. Please, come. Get down. Come. It's not sacrifice to abandon the one who love us. Whoever says anything, he lives with your thoughts. That's sacrifice! After your marriage, Do you know how many proposals her mother got him? He denied everyone. You didn't esteem that. But, his mother's words are more important to you, isn't it? Don't talk without understanding, Ashok. I took this decision for my sake. Please, allow me to go. I don't know why are you making me to suffer? Why can't you understand my pain? Look Sofia, I'll ask you one thing. Do you wish to live with Anand or not? You are lying, Sofia. We can commit many mistakes in our life, without aware of it. That will not affect us. If you do a mistake, aware of it... It'll make you feel guilty throughout your life. Now, the decision you're taking to leave Anand... ...is the mistake you're doing for your life. Sir, what's your call? The decision I took for her has gone wrong. Now, I agree whatever decision she takes. She isn't taking the decision, She wants to end everything. Hey, be silent. Sofia, don't think still. Do you wish to live with Anand or not? Tell us, Sofia. Though you said, she is thinking still. Let her go. What's this? He is talking, right? You might spoil everything it seems. Shut your mouth and keep quiet for sometime. What do you want to say more than this? Please, don't hinder her. Let her go, wherever she wants. Wherever she goes, I'll go along with her. Oh, gosh! I thought you've redeemed. Then, what? She smiled. Come here. Come, dear. -He feels shy. Come here. Sir, bless them. Come, let everyone take a selfie.
