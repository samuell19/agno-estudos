You've torn me apart. Rude as well. Being with you, of course. I hate you, you're disgusting. Anything else? You're useless in bed. You can't get it up. Where's the body? Have you found the body? No sign of it. The car was open. It must have been carried away by the current. Then there's nothing more we can do. Come back up. I'm Claude's brother. You were fast. I left as soon as I heard. What happened? He was driving too fast and lost control. Yes, I know, they told me, but how did you survive? I jumped out. What about Claude? He was trying to change gear, to brake... But he must have taken too long. Please don't talk about it. How fast were you going? I don't know. Did the brakes work? I have no idea. Remember to sign the statement before you go. The body might wash up with the tide. Where will you go now? Me? I don't know, I'll go back to Paris. I can't stay here. Try to think of something else. I can't. Did you really love him? You're from Vienna, right? No, Linz. But I met him in Paris. It was an accident. It's terrible, I know... But deep down... Deep down? Nothing. I was just saying. And you? Were you close? Yes, to a degree. We didn't really know each other, I spent a lot of time in America. To be honest, we were very different. Did you hurt yourself jumping out? Jumping out of what? From the car. It's true. You're right. I wasn't thinking. Excuse me, I don't feel well. Where do you live? Rue Jean Jacques. What's wrong? Drive faster, drive faster... Please, I can't take this any more. Then goodbye. You've got my number... Call me when you want. Nothing. I'll be thinking of you. Thank you and goodbye. Serge. I'm Afraid Afraid of what? Come on, get in. I heard a gun shot. It was probably a motorbike. I'm sure I heard it. No. Look, it's the same revolver. The same? Do you want to see? Relax. You need to forget. Get some sleep. Good morning. My name's Dorothy. Does my name mean anything to you? No, sorry, should it? I'm Serge's ex-wife. Well I'm not his new one. It's not a great relief. Even though he dumped me, it annoys me... that he hides my existence from his girlfriends. What are you doing here? If you don't mind me asking? I was a friend of Serge's brother. I understand. Speaking of which, what was his name? Claude. Right, it's true... I'm so sorry. How did Serge take it'? Well... They barely knew each other. The usual chaos. He'll never change. It's always the same. If I weren't around. I like your trousers. Thank you. How do you find him? Who? Serge. He's nice. The moon... This is all we need. Did Claude look like him? Not at all. I apologise for the indiscretion... Were you in the car with Claude? Yes, I was there... So Serge left you? That pig... On my twenty-fifth birthday... But I'll always love him. Are those trousers antelope? No, denim. He'll be furious when he sees that I've tidied up. Why? He won't be able to find anything. I love order, I'm a business-woman. I'm in charge of a company that sells just about anything... It doesn't matter what, just a simple phone call... A rose, an elephant, a cop, a secretary... Everything! Apart from a Swede to comfort you. But how did it happen? What? The accident. It happened... Wait, I can hear footsteps, we'd better make a mess again. Don't worry, it's the cleaning lady. I like you, you're nice. Will it be the same height as that one there? Just a few storeys less. The prefabricated pieces will go up in groups of four. Yes, exactly. There's a call for you. Who is it? A woman, she says it's urgent. ls that you Serge? Can you hear me? I have to see you. Speak up, I can't hear you. I can't hear you? Please come home. Serge. Who are you? What happened? Nothing, forgive me. I'm a fool. Forgive me. What were you playing at? I was with some important clients. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm so nervous after everything that's happened. I can't free myself... Of what? Of the fear. Fear of what? I realise I've been such a fool. But I can't control myself. Did you get on well with my brother? Naturally, I already told you. You always got on well, you were always in a good mood? It depended on the day. I don't want to speak ill of the dead... But I can't say Claude was someone... Take a good close of sleeping pills and go to bed. No, I feel better now. What were you doing in Brittany? Nothing special. A long weekend. A romantic holiday. More or less. It's a disaster that can't be explained. Let's not talk about it any more, straight after our quarrel, I... Had you argued? A little. I thought you got on well? Everyone does, every now and then. Right. What did you argue about? Please, Serge. Who's been tidying up? Dorothy's been here. Yes, your wife. Ex-wife. She acts like we're still married. And she won't return her keys. What can I do'? Have her arrested? She came to invite you to a dinner... In honour of certain clients, I think. When? Tonight. What does it have to do with me? It sounds very boring. Of course, the usual bores. Who does she think of if they're a nuisance? Me. She's a pain in the backside. I'm too nice. Have you thought about going back home? Do you mind if I stay one more night? No. I'm sorry to intrude like this... But I want to be sure I'm better. I'm not short of space... But I can't dedicate much time to you. I have so much work to do. Alright, I'll go. I promise. I'm afraid. This is formidable coffee. Exquisite, my compliments. Thank you. It's the only thing I can do. In the kitchen, at least. Well, it tastes great... And this champagne. And I thought you were such a terrible cook. But you can't survive on coffee alone... I'd be in a clinic by now. What time is it? What time is it? It's upside down. Nice ring. What time is it? Don't you have a watch? No. Not since you lost mine. Buy another one. With what you earn. With what I earn? Yes, good. Between the divorce costs and the money I have to give you... And the tax increases... Whose fault is that? Does it matter whose fault it is? It's all your fault. Listen, don't start. I've heard it all before. Always causing a scene. When I lost that deal because you wrote down the wrong number... More than 3000 francs! You see? Do you remember? Yes, and you've upset me. Your foolish jealousy. I never cheated on her. Of course. What time is it? Tell me. Buy yourself a second hand watch, and leave me alone. If you don't tell me the time... I'll tell them you invited me because you can't stand to be alone with them. 11:30. Scoundrel. A woman's handbag is like Ali-Baba's cave. Do you practise often? What? Target practise. I'm a champion. So where's the revolver? It must be in another handbag. Do you feel threatened'? Yes, by ghosts. But the bullets go straight through them. You're acting very strangely. Me? Yes. Do you think I killed someone? Who said anything of the sort? With or without? With. I'm sorry to go back over it... But there's something I don't understand... How did you, a fragile woman... Were able to jump out of the car, but my brother couldn't? It isn't a matter of strength. I agree. Did you call the police? No, a farmer who was passing by called them, I was barely conscious. Really? But you told me you got up straight away? No... What I mean is... I was confused for a moment, so I didn't see the car sink. I told you this a hundred times. What are you afraid of? I'm not going to answer you any more. But why haven't they found his body? He didn't have a weight attached to his feet. You a have pistol clip in your bag, is that normal to you? Ali-Baba's cave indeed. Do you have a gun license? You could get into a lot of trouble if the police stop you. And there must be a serious reason to take that kind of risk. Don't you agree? I know there's no shortage of insane girls who enjoy going around... with a revolver in their handbag. But you? You don't seem like the type. No. Are you going to answer me or not? Then I'll continue. You're afraid. You said so yourself. So... You won't stop me talking so easily. Talk, talk, talk... I... Get dressed and prepare your suitcase, we're going on a trip. Where to? It's a surprise. Claude was a very interesting person... Capable of playing some very nasty jokes. He'd do terrible things when we were young, then he'd say I did it. Did he play any nasty jokes on you? How did you end up in bed with him? It happened. He was kind, he had time to waste... Women give in, sooner or later. I see you have no illusions about your sex. Effectively. Why did you sleep with me? For the same reasons. Enough, you're annoying me. Don't you like Brittany? You should know I adore it. What are you doing there? What more do you want to know? I'll tell you straight away... What time was it? Seven, I think. What direction did you come from. Over there. You were driving fast, is that right? Well, yes. That's where the car fell in. Of course. Why didn't you jump out? Will you stop this? You're going to do as I say. Let go of me. Let go of me, you brute. I said let go of me. And don't go anywhere. Come back, don't do anything foolish. How long has he been down there? Around forty minutes. He dived in over there. There he is. Over there. You had us worried. Have you found something? Why did you call the police? I was worried about you. Or were you worried about yourself? Tell the truth. Do you think I killed him? I wouldn't have called the police. Unless you did it to divert their attention away from you. Don't make me laugh. This is a serious. And you haven't shed many tears. Nor have you. And two days later, you got into bed with me. I didn't force you. You stayed here, right? Two rooms? One. Which room did you stay in with Claude? Five. Three has a bathroom and a garden. Can we have room five? Yes, as you wish. I slept in it two years ago and I remember really liking it. If it's all the same to you. Naturally. And your suitcases? They're in the car. Come this way. Here's your revolver. It might need some oil, but it's in good shape. How do you know it's mine? The clips are the same. By the way, there's a bullet missing. What did you practise on? A ghost? Do you still think I killed him? I don't know. But I know you lied when you said you got on well with Claude. No one got on well with him, especially women. They all left him. They wouldn't last more than ten days. Fine. I detested him, I admit it. A violent, jealous man, to the point of obsession... But he couldn't see it. He literally tortured me. I'm glad he's dead. Why didn't you leave him? I did, but he found me and begged me to return... He said he could explain everything. I was weak and I accepted. Why did you have the revolver? That doesn't concern you. Did you kill him? No, no... Enough! I don't believe you. No one's forcing me to talk, there weren't any witnesses when we argued. It would be easy to lie to you. Where's the missing bullet? I don't know. In the middle of the fields. It's the truth. At a certain point, I thought he wanted to strangle me so I shot at him... And he moved out the way, I swear. Not very convincing, unfortunately. Don't be stupid, I could've lied if I wanted to. I could've told you I shot at a crow in a tree, just for fun. Or even... And where did this happen? Here, just below the dining room. And no one heard it? How do I know? We left straight away. Is anyone there? I'm coming. What's going on? I'm sorry to disturb you. Listen, did you already know that woman who came in with me? I don't think so. Think about it... She came here three days ago, and she stayed here. If you say so, yes, perhaps, perhaps. I came down to apologise for her... Because she shot at a crow when she left. Just for fun. She had a little 6.35... A revolver for target practise, about this big. I imagine she woke everyone. I didn't hear anything. No gun shot? No... Very well. Nothing. No shots from a firearm. You know, it isn't a revolver that makes a lot of noise. It was also windy. For the last time, what are you afraid of? First... Of being suspected. It's true, I wanted him to die. His death was a relief. Yes, alright, and second? I get the feeling someone's watching me. Who'? It's just a feeling. Did you make love here? Where did you kill him? At the edge of the cliff? Before the car fell. No, I'm begging you, Serge, I told you a million times. How did Claude make love? Stop it, stop it... Or I'll end up hating you as much as I hated him. Why did you kill him? Can I help you? The brown moccasins in the window. You know the good places. You, too. Thanks to Serge, one of the few things I owe him. We're in the same condition. Not too happy, perhaps. Is Serge still nice? Adorable. He was so boring when he was with me... He only ever smiled at the table, when he read his newspaper. I don't know why he married me, I was infatuated. But what was Claude like? Very different. Tell me, what does it feel like, making love to two brothers? What is it? Are you upset? My life has been hell these last fifteen days... He argues with me all the time. He torments me over silly things. I can't take it any more. Leave him. It sounds like it runs in the family. But, I can't... Listen, shall we play a nice little joke on him? Pack your bags and come and stay with me. Impossible. I'll try the other pair. Why? I know what he's like, he'll be furious when knows I'm involved. You're very kind, but no. Do it for me. Let me have some fun. He made me suffer so much in the past. Disgusting... And ungrateful. Please. Can't you drive a little faster? It's magnificent. I need another one. What about me? As much as I know him, Serge must be the twelfth. Speaking of which, you... Let's drop the formalities. Why don't you come and work for me? We'll look for rattle-snakes. Senegalese waiters... Vintage candle-makers. Post-menopause duchesses. Eggs from... Get out of here. Have you gone mad? Bravo, you're a man. Get out of here. This is my house. Right... It doesn't matter, get out of here. Don't you want something to drink? There you go. What happened? Dorothy, go away, I need to speak to the lady... And I don't like you listening in. At least you're honest. As always. Do you want me to go? Yes. What time is it? It's... 8:05. In the evening? Then I have to go, I have an appointment with my new boyfriend. A marvellous Sicilian. Good evening, dear. You see... I wanted to tell you... That it's not because you... I've completely forgotten what I... What you... ? I wanted to tell you. Forgotten. I've forgotten all of it. Fools. What's so funny? Great, I don't count. Idiot. You idiot. 'Affluent manager from the Ganges.' Who'll remember that? Drop dead. Why do you laugh so much? And you? I'm not laughing. Me neither. Why did you kill him? I didn't kill him, fool. Why do you keep going on about it? You told me yourself, you hated your brother. Absolutely. Well then? Well then? You see, what prevents me... What prevents you? Prevents me? It infuriates me! Alright, what infuriates you? Is that you killed him. You don't sit well in all of this. I don't care about him, but I can't arrest you. Why not? Think about it, it's impossible. Why is it impossible? Really, do you want me to arrest the woman I love? What? Say that again. I said I'm not going to the police. Why won't you go? Because you love me, you said. I love you. But you're still a criminal. A telegram for you. Cancel all my appointments, I have to go away. And book me a charter flight, immediately. And if they ask for you? I'll be back tonight. They're asking for a hotel in the old quarter but there isn't one. But the client is insisting. What should I do? Tell them to go to hell. So, go to Rue Lafayette, ask Miranda for the directions... And get them to show you their cheapest products. Aren't you tired of these lunatics? They pay well, my dear. The crazier they are, the more they pay. Alright, boss. We found the body yesterday, it washed up in a fishing net. The face is unrecognisable and we couldn't get any fingerprints... But we have good reason to believe he's your brother. Our tests indicate that he died twenty days ago... And this coincides with the date of the accident. Also, the body was found a few miles from the scene of the accident... But it could have been carried there by the current. The size is the same, as is the age. And despite the decay... The clothes and hair colour seem to correspond. Did you find a bullet in his body? Bullet? Why? Nothing, nothing. You never know. Are you capable of identifying the body? Twenty-five percent, at the most. Well, goodbye, and give Dorothy my regards. Why don't you answer me? Have you decided not to greet me? After all this time... I was expecting a different welcome. My dear. Do you not love me any more? Fine, you don't love me any more. I don't care about the rest. I was sure you'd seek refuge here. Won't you answer me? Aren't you happy? You should be, at least, I think so. If I am alive, you are innocent. Go away. Don't be afraid... You won't see me again. But don't you want to know how I got here? No, not at all. It's a very moving story, if it hadn't been a Spider I'd be dead. But I floated to surface safe and sound. I saw you by the rocks, and I had an idea. I swam underwater along the rocks, and I ended up in a cove... A little bit further away. Shall I continue? I hitch-hiked to Paris, trying to avoid people... Then I had fun following you around. Do you know what you looked like? A mad butterfly. Amusing. I've decided to go to Canada, I have some money there. What do you think of my plan? It's magnificent. I don't think you get it... Do you love him? That's none of your business. But it is my business. You see, my own brother steals my girlfriend... I left you. Granted. But what counts is the result... I'll disappear and everyone will think I'm dead... So I am dead. Try to understand. If I'm dead... You killed me! Up to a point. In Serge's mind, at least, and that's the important part. And you'll go back to being the insane butterfly dancing around a lamp. Serge will want to know, he won't give you a moment's peace. He'll torture you, and goodbye true love. Not a bad idea. You won't do it, Claude. But I will. It's too despicable. Don't be a fool, this isn't going to go away. Get out of here. Sure, and forever. Do you hate me, at least? You can't imagine how much. That's better, good. I'll enjoy it even more, thanks for the favour. Do you remember Christmas Eve in St. Tropez? What about it? On the hotel balcony... The sea, the moonlight... Do you remember? I don't want to talk about it. I ignored you all night. I was enjoying myself. But Gianni thought you were stupid... Loathsome. And boring... So boring. Whore. Well'? What are you doing in the dark? I killed him. What? I killed him. No, no... What are you talking about? I know you didn't kill him. I killed him. Don't talk nonsense. It's all my fault if I tortured you like this. They found his body. No sign of any bullet wounds. I've just seen it. And you're sure it was him? Of course... The same size, same age, and the same duration in the water. There's no doubt about it, absolutely none. The nightmare is over. Yes, you're innocent, my love. Don't you understand? You're innocent.
