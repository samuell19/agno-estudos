Nicholas! It's a girl. Hello? ( Hi. Nicholas? ) It's Jenna. Oh. Hi. I was just upstairs. Right. Listen... I was having some people over tonight... I thought you'd want to come Tonight? I don't know. I'm a little busy. Vicki's going to come. Vicki? Your cousin? Yes. Bobby's coming too. Bobby? What time? Around Eight. Try not to be late. I'll try. Bye. It isn't much of a party. It seems early, still. You should've called me. We could've come together. You haven't gotten rid of it, have you? No. He's getting better. Don't fuckin' lie to me, Nicky. Am I early? Yeah. Oh. Okay, then. So! Here we are! The four of us? Yeah. Isn't that okay? You put your hair like that again. It's so slimy! My Dad puts his hair like this. Vicki's Dad is a policeman. Cop. My Dad. He has a gun. Do you wanna see it? Does he hide it? No. It's on the rack. Okay, then. - Here it is. On the wall. - Wow, it's neat. ( I could easily kill you with this. ) (-Yeah, I bet you could. ) ( -And your friend, too. ) (It's a bolt action. It kills rabbits...) I thought there was going to be more people here. ( - I could show you. ) ( - That's okay, I believe you. ) Watch me do it. Okay? Pow! ( That's great! ) ( Can I try? ) What do you wanna do? See the gun? No, it's just a gun. ( besides, you'd probably shoot somebody. you don't know how to handle a gun ) ( No I wouldn't... All right then, what do you want to do? ) How did you do this year? - Good grades? - Yeah. ( ... same thing ) (... what we can do in the basement...) - How about you? - I passed! ( I don't think that would be right. what would your cousin know... ) I like those braids. ( - well it was just an idea. ) ( - I'm sure I'll have another party...) ( ... and you can come and I'll be playing ) ( you can come up with x ideas, smartass ) ( oh, I had an idea. A good one. ) ( spin the bottle, again? ) It's looks so cute. Thanks. ( what's your name again? ) You're so stiff! loosen up! ( ouch, let go! ) That tickles. Nicholas. Is that what you're wearing? I don't know. Yes? He's come a long way. What if I don't like him? They we'll have a talk. Wash your hands! Stay here! Got the new Mr. Big Fist. It's a good one! Nicholas, this is Roy. Hello, Nicholas. I've heard a lot about you. How is work being? I don't know if I mentioned, that Roy works on trains. Something romantic about riding a train across the country. Even cathartic. Do you know what cathartic means? Yes. Oh. Good. Speaking of trains, I brought you a present. It's a pin. You could put it on your shirt or your jacket. That's really nice of you. It's so cute! Let me help you. There! I have to check on the food in the kitchen. This is a nice house. I grew up in a really big house over on Arburgh. It's so well-built. Like a wooden vault. I should buy it from you. Great picture. Yeah. Um, they're good. Why don't you tell me something about you? Like what? Do you have a girlfriend? You're probably too young for that. No, I'm not. Not everyone has a girlfriend. Not everyone's attracted to their friend. What would your mother say? What would your father say? I don't know what you're talking about. You can't hide this from your mother and me. Dad? Nicholas! The bird is ready. Great news. Because I'm starving. Nicholas, Would you help me dish? Maybe after dinner, you could give me a tour of the house. Maybe. It's not much to see. I know I'll disagreee. Did I ever tell you of how much this place reminds me of where I grew up? No. Big place around Arburgh. It's a lot like this place. Nicholas! I was thinking... maybe one day you'd like to come see the trains where I work. I know what trains look like. Not up close you don't. Nicholas... He was just offering. That's all it was. You don't have to. I thought you might like it. Well, that was great! I'll have to reciprocate some day. There's dessert, too. It's Nicholas's favorite. I can help, I'm sure. No, No. It's only a bowl. You don't like dinner. Did we get off to a bad start? I'm not really sure. I'm usually pretty good with... young adults. Red, ooh! My favorite, too! - Well, thanks for coming. - It was no problem at all. It was fun. - Really? - Of course. I haven't even had breakfast yet. You wanna play this early? I didn't come to play baseball. Is it - in your house? Is it - in your room? I won't let you. I'm sorry, Bobby. But you can't. Well, it's mine! I can do what I want. He's not even here. He died. It's the truth. Despite what's happened... It doesn't mean we still can't be friends. It probably makes us better friends. I'm not a bad guy, Nicky. Haven't you ever had to put down your dog. I would never do that. I guess I'm just more sensitive than you are. What's going on? Nothing. So, I'll meet you later, then. Thanks for the ice cream. My Mom doesn't let me eat ice cream in the morning. I don't see the harm in it. See you again, Robert! He's very nice. Oh. Tomorrow we're going on a picnic. I have to use the washroom. So! What would you say... if I said I really liked your mother. I don't know. Well... we haven't been going out that long. Truth is... Before your mother, I was with a lot of different women. I bet you knew that, though. The other night... I was thinking... I was going to have to win over two people. Instead of just one. Not that I'm not up to the challenge. So what about you? You have a girlfriend? Ah, you're probably too young for that. No, I'm not. Not everyone has a girlfriend. Not everyone. There's a couple of girls... There you go, then. There's this one girl, that has a cousin.. And I think she likes me. Well, there you go then. Think she would be my girlfriend? Well, I don't know her,... but you said she likes you, and that's a good start. ( what's going on? ) ( I know what these creatures are and what their plan is ) ( what plan? ) ( it's a separate component of a much larger organism ) ( this organism is made up of all these tiny individual creatures ) ( - well how do you know this? ) ( - well, it make's sense. listen...) ( each affect - a section of the being's anatomy ) ( the exciters - pieces of the being's sensory system ... ) ( the resonators - fragments of it's hearing system... ) ( the reactors, possibly an element of it's visual organ. ) ( do you see, now? ) ( i fear at that at this very moment they're gathering at a pre-determined place. ) ( they will blend, coalesce, unite to form this one gigantic being ) Tell me something about Vicki. What do you mean? Vicki. The girl you like. Vicki's Jenna's cousin. Jenna's the girl Bobby likes. ( that grid's coming with me ) ( don't try any funny stuff ) ( It's been a long day. my dogs are killing me ) ( got a creature here, Roy! ) ( bring that pickup around here ) ( all right boy, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... ) ( hey boy! get back here! ) ( don't waste you're time, boy, you can't escape ) What are you doing to Mom? ( it's magnificence. the thunder and glory! ) There's a little space where your experience can go. I'll show it to you. I'm not going anywhere. Nicholas? What's wrong? I know about your friend. How does that make you feel? I was just in the fort. The door was left open. Are you listening to me? What's going on? I'm sorry. Okay. We'll talk about it later. You remember the doctor? Open. Follow with only your eyes, please. How are you feeling? Sore. And stiff, too? Yeah. Well. Then I shouldn't have to tell you to stick to bed today. Actually... You better make it several days. He gave me these. You're supposed to take four of them. Four times a day. So you might as well take some right now. I don't want to. It's what he said. I'm sure they'll help. I'm sure they won't. Well then, you'll take them because I said. So then you're going to force-feed me those pills? It looks like it. Do you want some help? No. Do you feel sick? Don't watch me eat. I wasn't. Where are my things from the fort? Gone. You threw them out? Yes. You knew I would. I think I need to go for a walk, today. - I'll come with you. - No! It's a beautiful day. We could make it down to the river. It was just a thought. What if something happens to you while you're out there in the middle of nowhere? Could it get worse? The doctor doesn't think you're doing so badly. Please don't look at me that way. It's like I can't look at you in any kind of way. I asked nicely. Nicky? What are you doing? Going for a walk. Stretch my legs. What are you doing? Uh, just going for a walk. To Jenna's. Yeah. Why don't you come? Vicki isn't there. But you could still come. I don't think so. My Mom found him in my room with me. Before you took him. What were you doing? Nothing. What happened to him? I'm right here. ( don't look at me ) ( don't look at me ) ( don't look at me ) All in the past. It's just a part of growing up. There are a lot of little houses down this road. Sleep well?
