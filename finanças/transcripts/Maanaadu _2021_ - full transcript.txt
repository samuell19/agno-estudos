You don't worry Take this phone Look at this camera and share whatever happened to you We live in Kasim Nagar in Coimbatore Claiming my husband was involved in the 1998 Coimbatore bombings The police arrested him 'Then he was released They arrested him once again' 'Because of this continuous ordeal he couldn't find a decent job' 'His health deteriorated too and he passed away' 'Then to keep the fire burning at home my eldest son Rafiq dropped out of school' 'He got a good job and took care of us' He doesn't know how lucky he is. '...his passport was confiscated due to his father's police record' 'Police officers came to our door and took my son to the station' 'If he didn't comply with their orders' '...just like his father they threatened they would brand him a terrorist too' 'Somehow he managed to escape' 'He called me one day' He doesn't know how lucky he is. 'When we were leaving for the safe place Rafiq told us' 'The police caught us and locked us up in a bungalow' 'After that I have no idea what happened to Rafiq' 'I got no information about his whereabouts' 'I don't know why our Allah is giving us such grief' - 'What is it?' - I'll take care Hey...hey Rafiq Your mother is here Hey!

Till the last breath in my body For your sake I want to toil 24x7 and give up my life 'And I consider it a great honor' Long live Thamizh! Hail every Tamilian by birth! What is it, da? He doesn't know how lucky he is. Shooter is in the place of Rafiq Police have usurped the shooter's place Rafiq who has to kill the CM is shooting you instead The bomb meant for CM's car explodes in the crowd You are puzzled, right? He doesn't know how lucky he is. This day isn't repeating only for you, da If you die, it repeats even for me Yeah Why is this happening? What is the purpose? And how is it happening? You and I are in no way connected But it is happening to us Something is happening, so be it I'm not bothered about that But for me As per plan He doesn't know how lucky he is. Chief minister has to die Rafiq has to be blamed for his death Riots should be widespread That's it He doesn't know how lucky he is. We can never come out of this, sir Don't do this, sir Hey! Why are you dragging 'society' into this? Do you know who these people are? Puppets who lead the life we plan Just puppets According to our plan, news should only be about the assassination of our CM Next, in 'Bigg Boss' the reality show ...if I instigate a fight between Pooja and Jughead He doesn't know how lucky he is. All the families, for 1 month This will be the topic Then people will move on to IPL and World Cup That's all their attention span Why are you feeling so bad for them? - Sir, your assumption is wrong - HEY! Don't test my patience Don't you get what I'm saying? If you try to save those on the dais I'll ensure the bomb explodes in the crowd If you try to save the crowd I'll target the speakers on the dais Even if you die a 1000 times then reappear to try and save him I will also reappear a 1000 times to accomplish my mission And you know what? It will be a never ending story I just want to put a fullstop to that That's why I wanted this bloody meeting He doesn't know how lucky he is. Hey! Your eyes don't convince me you have reformed, da If you die just one more time and try to abort this conference I'll make sure you are aliiive to watch me kill each and every loved one of yours Your mother, father, relatives, friends It will be a genocide of sorts And I make sure You will cross that date and lose your near & dear ones I'll make your loss a reality You know, no? I'm capable of doing this So...hereafter Let's not meet again [TV News] Hey! If the CM has to die let him by all means die Just cross the day and move on, like he said How can I do that? He has killed 100s of people in front of my eyes CM has to die for some damn reason for a random man He shouldn't get caught, so he is making a religion the scapegoat That's why he is instigating riots He doesn't know how lucky he is. ...do you know how many generations have to bear the brunt to be freed? This CM will die, someone else will occupy his seat, he will also exit He will be succeeded by someone else But this blame It will never change A few years ago a leader was assassinated Do you know they targeted this section of the society? Now I have my doubts on even that conclusion That day she told us Allah and Lord Shiva have merged to make something emerge Do you know what that purpose is? This conference should not be held Is it enough if this conference is cancelled? - Then won't they kill the CM? - Let him be killed Let them try poisoning him, push him down the steps or even in the hospital That is not my problem Only if you kill him in a public gathering A particular religion or section of our society can easily be blamed He doesn't know how lucky he is. When the CM was speaking in the conference ...he was assassinated When we had the murderer and Rafiq in our custody ...they planted a bomb in the car They could've planted the bomb on the dais and killed the CM So someone on the dais should not die! Bingo! In the film 'Sarkar', why did Varalaxmi Sarathkumar kill her dad? For the Chief minister's post Similarly Mugilan kills his dad For the same post Did I hit the nail on its head? But Mugilan was in the car when the bomb exploded - Is that so? - Then it can't be Mugilan He doesn't know how lucky he is. Where can we find Mugilan now? Over there 'Tamizhvanan sir's demise' '...is an inconsolable loss to Tamil society and Hindu religion' 'The friendship we shared' 'Brother, contact me 'No...no, India under my control' 'In this grief-stricken time' 'Even if we do not have the mindset to hold a State level conference' He doesn't know how lucky he is. - Hello, sir - 'Vanakkam' I'm Seetha speaking Mr Khaliq's personal assistant Remember, you met him on the flight today? Yes, tell me Sir, actually my boss is...er He is flying to Mumbai to meet Ambani on urgent work Ambani, huh? Should I convey anything to the business tycoon?

Call me after you reach the Canon showroom Sir, my head is splitting You said, 'join me as an ally in my party' He doesn't know how lucky he is. Is this what you meant?!

I trusted you implicitly He doesn't know how lucky he is. Leader sir, please show mercy on me 'All of you have ganged up and hung me like a goat in a butcher's shop!' 'My rear end hurts like hell, sir' 'Manickam' 'Son of a bum!' 'If some random stranger dangles a carrot worth 5 billion' '...without enquiring the authenticity will you bring him to the CM's son?' 'What kind of muddy-politics are you dabbling in?' Hey, what is your connection with Tamizhvanan? 'Tell me' You plan to kill the Chief minister? If I want that post I have no other option 'After assassinating him' ...thrust the blame on terrorists We should instigate a religious riot He doesn't know how lucky he is.

We have spent so much money to organize this conference So many invitees from various districts are attending This is the base for the coming election Besides, you think they are coming to see you and me? They will be satisfied if they see their beloved leader Won't they be disappointed otherwise? He doesn't know how lucky he is.

I heard it He told me everything - Hey hey! - Who are you? - Security! - Tamizhvanan sir sent me 1 minute, sir Please watch this, sir 'Arivazhaga, believe whatever brother Abdul Khaliq tells you' 'He is my messenger' 'Paranthaman has planned to kill you in the conference' 'He wants to camouflage it as a major religious riot' He doesn't know how lucky he is. 'Khaliq brother saved me' 'So kindly listen to me' 'Do not attend the conference' Okay From the day I started my Party Tamizhvanan and Paranthaman have been my 2 pillars of support If Tamizhvanan is saying this all of a sudden I just can't believe it Sir, you have to trust him Aiyo! How do I- They plan to assassinate you on the dais by Rafiq They want to brand him as terrorist and instigate a religious riot Spoil the tranquility of Tamil Nadu He wants to step into your CM shoes, sir This is the truth and that's the reason you should not attend today's conference He can't abstain totally from attending the conferen- He doesn't know how lucky he is. Aiyaiyo! Sir, he is THE criminal Fraud, sir Listen to me I don't know how to make you understand Aiyo! Sir 1 minute...1 minute Try this, sir Tell Paranthaman you are not attending the conference Just try telling that, sir He will insist you attend, sir Hey! He doesn't know how lucky he is. Who are you? You seem to have spoken like my own conscience? Yes, man 30 long years My political dream 30 years old will finally come true today What kind of Party are you running? First you asked me to present you as leader Is this your game plan? For generations if this is continued ...when do I become CM? Should we hold a flag lifelong and keep saluting you in deference? He doesn't know how lucky he is. Instead of bottling up all this rage and resentment ...you could have been upfront and spoken to me He doesn't know how lucky he is. Don't try to pull the wool over our eyes We are witnessing everything daily Initially in our Party posters and banners ...we had your photo, mine and then his I'm just an insignificant also-ran What does that mean? He doesn't know how lucky he is. Whether today's conference is held or not I will organize a memorial service for you - And then be sworn in as CM - Hey! Leader He doesn't know how lucky he is. Let's do what we planned to do at the conference What does it matter if the CM dies here or on the dais? What does it matter if the assassin is Rafiq or Abdul Khaliq? He doesn't know how lucky he is. Hey! Dai...dai! Leader Didn't I tell you someone kidnapped Tamizhvanan? That's our man here He is the one who will kill the CM too Bonus is CM's son Terrorist killed our CM 'We nabbed him alive' Next CM is you You get your medal, man Sir, are you okay? Guar- GUARDS! Sir 'Temerity' 'Temerity to think you can pull it off by dying on replay mode' 'Even if you die a 1000 times then reappear to try and save him' 'I will also reappear a 1000 times to accomplish my mission' 'If you die just one more time and try to abort this conference' 'If I let go of today' 'Dhanushkodi knows how and where I came from, entire history, sir' 'He will erase whatever happened today into oblivion' ALLAAAH! DAI!! Khaliq brother? 'Sis...sister?' 'What is today's date?' 11th October 11th, huh? 10th...10th is over? He doesn't know how lucky he is. Oh! Feels like an entire film has been shot! Relax, brother 'Abdul Khaliq' I don't want to simply say 'thank you' And dilute the most precious help you did to me of saving my life Sir, I don't know what to say How did these events begin and how did they end? It's all a haze, sir Sir, what happened to the conference? Conference! Conference wasn't held Paranthaman's memorial was conducted 'Mugilan being shot and the events that followed were covered up' 'And the memorial service was held' In the end you made the villain a hero, sir That is politics for you, my boy Sometimes, even a good man is arm twisted to play a dirty hand in politics Politics has good policies, sir! 'NEWS HEADLINES' 'Last evening, in order to pay homage to MMK Party member Kalaichelvan' '...when Mr Paranthaman accompanied Hon'ble Chief minister Mr Arivazhagan' '...he suffered a cardiac arrest' 'Unfortunately Mr Paranthaman passed over on the way to the hospital' 'Upon hearing this tragic news leaders of all national Parties' He doesn't know how lucky he is. - Yes, ma'am - Patient's name Khaliq CM came now to enquire about his health Room #? - Room # 304 - Thank you No...no, they took him for a CT scan just now CT scan?
