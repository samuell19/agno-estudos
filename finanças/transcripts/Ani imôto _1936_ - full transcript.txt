Do it before another flood comes. Protect the banks! Hey! Not that way! Use bigger rocks. Throw them in as hard as you can. If you can't, go home. A solid foundation is the most important thing. I don't use pebbles. I've told you a hundred times. The boss has gone quite crazy recently. It's like he's possessed by a devil. Hey! Your loincloth is dry. You aren't working hard enough. I don't need you. Go home. I have my own rules. Dad! Goodbye. I'll be back next month. San. Drop in at the mason's. Brother? He won't be working. He doesn't come home. Maybe he's there. Would you find him? Any message? Nothing particular. He doesn't come home. I'll ask the mason. Let's eat lunch. Lunchtime. Hello, ma'am. Nice day. Fortunately we have fine weather. Here are some potatoes for you. They look good. Yes, delicious. Something wrong? He's like that. Be patient. He's stubborn. She's nice. Like Buddha. She's a good woman. Hello, San. It's you, San. Is your brother home? He's a problem. We're busy, but he doesn't show up. I want him to work. But he never finishes what he's doing. He's hunting girls again. He's horny. Look who's talking? You're worse, sex maniac. I hear your sister's back. Not again. - He loves her. - No. I like San better. You'll soon be prettier than your sister. Sure. Each time I see you, you get prettier. Flatterer. You want fish, catch them. I'll forget your advance. Don't waste your money. Your pay. Got 50 sen? My debt. I've paid them. Except the bamboo dealer. Is my son back? No, he's been away. How's Mon? Mon? She's still sleeping. She's dead tired. You may go. What are you doing? Carry those stones. It's you, brother. - Was San here? - Yes. Mon. Any letters? From your man, Obata? Letters? Forget it. Letters are no good. He knocked you up and left you. That's none of your concern. How have you been? Happy with your girls? You don't look like you could make love? Just like that? Maybe it's OK with you, but... Enough! Shut up! Ino, you're back. Obata is a gigolo. You made love to him. You put out and got pregnant. You should get rid of it before it's born. I hate a crying baby, especially his baby. Ino, that's cruel of you. Mind your own business. It's your fault, mum. You sent her to town. I knew this would happen. Girls aren't safe in town. You picked up scum to love. He's a lot smarter than you. He laid you, knocked you up and left. He couldn't stand watching your face. Let me worry about that. Even if you can't get laid, there's no need to be so nasty. Girls will hate you all the more. Obata went away without giving his address. Still you defend him. Love is blind, or maybe you're nuts. If you have the baby, people will never forgive you. You'll have to take the kid to Tokyo and drop dead. Ino! It's your fault. You bore a slut and want to shut me up. How about San? I can't think of her without pitying her. She comes home when she takes a day off. She never forgets a gift for mum. She's considerate. You have such a nice sister. Look at yourself, you're such a lazy bum. You always blame others. But sometimes you can't. Don't be mad at her now. Let your dad scold her. He keeps silent. You must keep silent too. You made your girls pregnant too. And mum took care of them. When dad found one of them at the back door, I covered her. You were in the shadow and secretly thanked me. Now I'm pregnant, why treat me so badly? Am I a filthy dog or something? I'm not depending on you. You're just cold and mean to me. I'll have this baby. I'll pay all the necessary expenses. I won't trouble mum or dad again. This is a chance. I'll be independent. No one will tell me what to do. Dad said, "Take care of yourself. "I won't see you again." You're only my brother. Why complain? It gives me a headache, that's all. Hello, Mon! It's a long stay. It's too hot in town to go back. A woman can make a living somehow. Where's the Akaza residence? Straight ahead and turn left. Hello. Hello! Anyone in? What do you want? Does Mon live here? Yes, she does. My name is Obata. Mr. Obata? Is she back? Only once a month. She works in Gotanda. Is that so? I came to apologize. Take your time. We'll listen. Come in. I want to talk to her. Have a seat. I'll bring my husband. Talk to him. Wait here. Dear! Dear! What? - Come home. - What for? It's him. The man, Obata. Obata? Mon's man? He wants to apologize. He's young and gentle. Don't be violent. - He's sorry. - Sorry for what? Maybe about the baby. Maybe he thinks it's alive. - Is he a gigolo? - No, he's a gentleman. If he were a bad man, he wouldn't have visited us. Mr. Obata? Have some tea. I'm Mon's father. What do you want? I'm listening. I've been away from her for a long time, but... Actually my father locked me up. I couldn't escape. I've finally returned to Tokyo. I'll pay her expenses. I've always been sorry for her. I want to buy back my conscience. Buy back your conscience? I'm sorry for the trouble. Is that all? No. About my baby... It was born dead. It drove Mon crazy. Where is she? Give me her address. I owe her an apology. I'll apologize and feel better. "Apologize and feel better"? Damn you! You want to "feel better"? Dear. She won't see you again. You may go. I'm busy. Mr. Obata. Quit fooling around with girls. You won this time. Goodbye. Are you leaving? Mr. Obata, forgive my husband. No hard feelings. How's Mon? Her health has recovered, but... She's ruined herself. I'm sorry. Can't I have her address? I don't know it. - I'll ask her next time. - Please do. I'll tell her about your visit. She'll be glad. Will you accept this? - Money? - My compliments. - What will my husband say? - Please take it. Keep it secret. Tell Mon I want to see her. Beautiful flowers. You take care of them. - You want some? - No, they soon wither. Plantains. Irises. - Those? - Chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums. - What colour? - White. I see. How old are you? Me? Twenty-four. Twenty-four? Will you give her this? My address. Goodbye. Take care. Hey, you. I'm Mon's brother. I want to talk. Come. Are you Obata? Seen Mon? No. I haven't. You knocked her up and left her. Why show up now? - I wanted to apologize. - Apologize? She's my dear little sister. We shared a bed. I took her to the toilet so she wouldn't wet the bed. I never spent a day without seeing or eating with her. She didn't know she had a birthmark until I told her. We were more than brother and sister. When she returned pregnant, I bullied her, called her names. I beat her up. Mum thought I meant it, so she hated me. Instead, she was kind to Mon. Otherwise, everyone would have turned against her. I knew you'd come someday. I wanted to tell you what Mon meant to me. I wanted you to know I actually raised her. You're a man. You just laid her and went away. You can't love a labourer's daughter. You thought you could easily dump her. But you were wrong. I won't let you go like my dad did. It was my fault. I've no excuse. Apologize. What else can I do? Can you leave her like that? I have something to talk to her about. Marriage? That too. Liar. No violence, please. Let's talk instead. What? Words can never reform a man like you. Mon suffered more. She's no longer a lady. She's a slut now. But she will never want to marry you. She'd refuse your proposal. She's ruined, but not in her mind. She was a virgin when you seduced her. And she threw her virginity in the mud. It was all for you. If only you hadn't made fun of her. Don't see her again. Don't torture her anymore. Promise. I'm sorry. I'm to blame. Go home. I'm her brother. If you have a sister, you'll understand. You alright? Sure. Hey! The bus stop for town is at the crossroads. San! Sis. Sometimes I miss mum. This way. Why don't you take the bus? It's so far. Not that far. Let's see dad first. He'll be surprised. Why not later? Scared? Stupid. We'll see each other sooner or later. I like the country. The blue sky, a picnic. They make you happy? Not you? You come home too, every month. I want to be free from men, once in a while. You always talk about men. Beautiful. Are you happy working as a maid? Yes, I am. Really? How many men in the house? Three. the master, his son and his secretary. His wife is sick. She's very kind. Doesn't he give you the eye? Oh, no. He's a great scholar. Scholars can be rakes. - But... - What's so funny? He has a bald head. Mum! I met sis on the bridge. You haven't eaten yet? A gift. Hello. I'm tired. I'd like some tea. The bus smelled of gas. I'm thirsty. - I'll get some tea. - Don't bother, I'll get it. Mon. About a week ago, Mr. Obata came here. Obata did? What a trip. Far from town. What did dad say? Was he violent? No, he was even compassionate. - Is it true? - Of course. I was quite surprised. He's changed. He used to be so wild. I'm sorry. He didn't need to come. He didn't see Ino, did he? I don't think he did. That's fine then. Otherwise, there'd have been trouble. He's not a bad man. Don't praise him. He left you with his baby. I had many men after him, but... No one was like him, I loved everything about him. That's enough. Some of them were handsome. But they show off their good looks. San's listening. But I don't want to marry him anymore. I love him in my mind. In reality, he's not so good anymore. -Why do you always talk about men? I can't criticize them like that. First of all, I know so little about them. You don't know anything. I know the world and men too well. They're filthy. Mon! But when I'm away from them, I forget what I usually think about them. I'm careful at first, but it doesn't last long. You're impossible. Brother's back. Really? It's lunchtime. Welcome home. Hey, slut. You're back again. For free meals. Don't stay too long. Go back to your lowly customers. We're decent people. You're too filthy to stay in this house. Brother, don't be so mean to Sis when she's back. You're a baby, San. Shut up. Sluts like Mon are immune to a beating. They can't be reformed so easily. When will you get a decent job? Till then you should stay away. Ino, stop it. Let's eat. Your man came here. Because he thought he could lick us. Obata? Did you see him? Yes, I followed him after he left. What did you do? Everything I wanted. You weren't violent? I kicked him He didn't put up a fight. It served him right. Say it again. What did you do? He was half-dead. Half-dead? And he didn't fight? Damn you! Who asked you to do that? He was a stranger to you. I slept with him. It has nothing to do with you. Who told you to kick him? How could you beat him? You're just scum! What are you doing? Pig! Kill me, go on! Kill me! Alright, I'll break your ribs. Kill me! Let go of me! She's getting worse. Brother. Why are you crying? Listen. I'm not cheap like you. You can only lay lousy bitches. Please stop! According to you, I'm a depraved slut. I can't marry a decent man. I can't tell my parents where I live. But I can't let you beat up the man I loved. You knew he was sorry and wouldn't fight back. How can you call yourself a man? How could you beat him? You let him know I have a brother like that! You disgraced me. You've shamed me. Ass! Mon! Don't talk that way! Stay out of it, mum. I don't want to have a bully for a brother. - You want another beating? - Beat me if you want! You fists can't change a girl's mind. The time's have changed. Hicks like you can never understand what I do! Ino, I want you to leave. Damn you! Get lost! Sis. You amazed me. What a girl. Not so bad. Don't worry. I've never heard a girl talk that way. Please lead a decent life, like a decent girl. Maybe you think I'm a slut, but I'm not that bad. I've just had no chance to be decent. Mr. Obata's address. It doesn't mean anything anymore. Something's wrong with me. I feel sick. You aren't pregnant again are you? No. If I was I wouldn't have come home. I came back because I missed you. For better or worse, I want to come home. Sometimes I even miss my nasty brother. This job lasts all summer. If you want it, raise your hands. Good! Then work hard. Earn a lot so you'll survive!
