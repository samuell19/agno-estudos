(mesmerizing alternative music) - We all have over the last 24 hours or so slipped into a coma of confusion and speculation. I've heard some of the stories going around. They go from the divine to the absurd. I think this happened, or I heard that this happened. What has actually happened has been documented by the proper authorities, and I give you my word, every bit of it is true. (mesmerizing alternative music) (moves into eerie alternative music) (crickets chirping) (ominous instrumental music) - Hmm... Do you that Socrates said an unexamined life is... ...not worth living? - Shut the fuck up, Harold. - Has he changed his story? - Nah. - And the Sheriff? - He's not happy about it. Besides the obvious conflict of interest, it's a federal case now. - Poor bastard. - Still reckon it's just a missing person situation? - Until we find a body. - I think you mean bodies. - So which one of you is the bad cop? - We're FBI. - What's the difference? - We're not into this whole small town, dick-measuring bullshit. So no good cop, bad cop. - Just cops cops. - Okay, so you're FBI. - We don't have a dog in this fight. That's why we're here. This is Agent Dixon, I'm Agent Costa. - You got a lot of priors, here. Petty theft, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment. - That was a... That was, I was, I was a different person back then. - So what happened between now and then? Seems like you've been a ghost for what, six years? - Six years. - Yeah, something like that. - But there was no missing persons report ever filed. - I guess I wasn't important enough. - Everyone's important, Joseph. Everyone and everything. It's all connected. Well, that's what I've found anyway. - Your buddy in the nextdoor room-- - Not my buddy. - I can see how a guy like that can get under your skin. - And we're gonna get the story out of one of you, one way or the other. You seem smart enough, too smart for this shitburg. - You really have no clue, do you? (quiet ominous music) It wasn't me, and it wasn't him. It was... What it was. - What what was, Joseph? - It was real. And nobody was ready for that.

(relaxing country music) (record player loses power) - You comfortable? Can I get you anything? - How 'bout my lawyer, or maybe a phone so I can call my lawyer. - A lawyer (laughs). This is just a friendly chat Dale. You don't mind if I call you Dale. - Where's my brother, where's Ray? - Doin' whatever Podunk sheriffs do, I guess? What, whittling? - Really dude? You are not ready for primetime. (agents laughing) - That's why I joined the Bureau. - Mm-hmm. Your pal has got one hell of a story. - Yeah, he's got lots of stories. Not a whole lot of anything else. - You don't get along, do you? - Cain and Abel kind of thing, is it? - I don't know what he is anymore. - What? What do you mean by that, what he is? - Who, I said who. I don't know who he is anymore. Especially after what I saw. - Yeah, who's on first, what's on second, I don't know's on third, after what exactly, Dale? - Nevermind. Just forget it. - Oh Dale. You know there's some things one can not just forget. - Ah shit, my back! - Alan, oh my god, I'm sorry! - What happened? - She threw the dart into my back, that's what happened. - I mean, what happened to the lights? - Oh my god. - Can somebody go get the first aid kid, Tanya? - Let me help, I should put my nursing degree to some use. - I got it, I messed it up, I'll fix it. - You got my beer? - Yeah, I got it. - My brother will know what to-- - Your brother will know what to what? - What to do when a fuse blows in this shit-box your daddy was so proud of. - You just keep my father's name out of your mouth. - Or what? - It's not polite to speak ill of the dead, Carl. - And? I spent my whole life being polite. I spent my whole life livin' by my daddy's good book. Where'd it get me? Stuck here lookin' after you all, holdin' it down, keepin' shit together, that's where. While you pussyfoot around this guy's feelings, this guy, who was off who-the-hell-knows-where while I was busy whipin' his daddy's ass when the cancer-- - Stop it. - This guy, who couldn't even be bothered to come to his own father's funeral, and now I'm the one that's gotta be polite? Come on, let's go fix this 'fore all the beer gets skunky. - You seem a bit tense. Do you want some water? - I'm fine. - Asprin? - I said I'm fine. - Are you sure, 'cause we could be here for a while. - We'll see. - Plan on another vanishing act? Going to disappear again for what? - Six years. - Six years. - Yeah, so they tell me. So you've told me, repeatedly. - Told you? What do you mean by that? - What do you want me to say? - Nothing big, just the truth. - No, that's the last thing you wanna hear. - Try us. - And you can start with, why did you need someone to tell you how long you've been gone for? (crickets chirping) - Whole house is out, so are the lights outside the garage, the whole street, I think something-- - So it's not a fuse, yeah we got that already, thanks. - Well, this one's out. - Yeah, mine. - Mine too. - Mighta if you'd changed the the batteries this decade. - That doesn't make sense, I'm sure that-- - Denny, didn't Dad have some candles around here? Somebody call the power company. - That's weird, my phone is dead too. - You shoulda charged it babe. - I did, like an hour ago. - Why don't you make yourself useful, you call. - Don't have one. - Who doesn't have a Smartphone? - I don't know, a smart person maybe. - Mine's dead too. - Mine's dead too. - Okay, everything electrical's out, even stuff with batteries? - Alright wait, this has gotta be a coincidence. - There's a landline out in the garage, I'll check that, and a generator in the shed, I'll see if there's some gas in it. - Good to see you can be useful. - Denny, why don't you come give me a hand? - You heard the man. (door squeaks) (crickets chirp) - This is what it's come down to, the Campbells spreading all over everything Dad built like some kind of mold? - It's done Joseph, it's time to move on. - To where? - I figured I would ask you that, you're the expert on movin' on. - That's not fair. - Joe, you left me here alone when Dad was sick, what was I supposed to do? The Campbells were there, you weren't. - And now they've come to collect, is that it? - You can't just show up after six years, refuse to tell anybody where you-- - It's complicated. - It's not complicated! You pick up the phone, you tell us you're still alive! We had a funeral for you Joseph, we buried a suit. - But why them? They already own the whole goddamn town. (Joseph sighs) (clattering) - And so what would you have done in my shoes? - I'm not saying I have the answer, but we both know this can't be it. - You know, you oughta save the sermon for the Reverend. (clattering) Try it now. (engine starts) (crickets and cicadas chirp) (key turns in ignition) (ominous instrumental music) (phone dials) (phone ringing) (phone ringing - Sheriff Campbell. - Ray. - That's right, who am I speaking with? - Ray it's Joseph, Joseph Byrne. - Joseph Byrne, really. - In the flesh. - Where're you calling me from, Joseph? - From the shop in my garage. - In your garage. Well that is a surprise. How long you been back, Joe? - Couple days. I've got to, I've gotta sign the transfer papers. The power's out. - Your power. Your power's out, huh? Well that's fucked up. - Yeah it is. Is anybody else having problems? - I don't know, it's the first I've heard. First I'm hearing about a lot of things. Do Carl and Dale know you're back? Joseph? Joseph? I said do my brothers know you're back. (strange metallic screeching) - Yeah, yeah I'd say they're aware. They're over here helping with the uh, transition. - Well, it's a little late for me to drive that far out of town right now, and um, Harold's probably drunk by now, so. Why don't I make a few calls and see if we can get somebody out your way in the morning. - I gotta go. (chattering noise) (distant undulating humming) (chattering noise) (distant humming) (frogs croaking) What's done is done. Time to move on. (strange metallic screeching) (crickets chirping) - So your brother was a mechanic? - What do you mean, was? - You tell us. - My brother is a prophet. - Who fixed cars? (Agent Costa laughs) - A prophet is without honor in his home country. - Yeah. Tell that to Jim Jones and the rest of the Kool-Aid drinkers. - I thought he was the comedian. - No, no, she (laughs), she has her moments. Tell us a little more about your brother Carl. The mechanic prophet. - You know, a man can be more than just one thing. Carl taught me that. - Fair enough. So where is he now? (mellow rock music) (whispering) (kissing) - What's taking so long, you think? - Oh, maybe he did one of his Houdini acts again. (Tanya laughs) Let's hope this time he signed the papers first. (Tanya laughs) - Don't you think it's weird that nothing electrical's working? - The generator's working. - That runs on gas. - Duh, the power's out. - I mean nothing, like even stuff with batteries. You ever heard of a neutron bomb? It's like an A-bomb. It only fries electronics. It keeps the buildings standing, the people okay. - Who'd do something like that? - A lotta people hate America, especially these days. - Right so,uh, uh, Long Duk Dong, (laughter) he dropped a bomb on us? - (laughs) Long Duk Dong? - Yeah, that midget dictator from North Korea. - It's Kim Jong-un. Long Duk Dong is from Sixteen Candles. - Alright, well you know who I mean, okay, so, so Kim Jon-dong, he got himself a neutra bomb and he decided the best place to explode it is Upper Broome County? That's ridonkulous. - What if it's not just here, what if it's everywhere? - It can't be everywhere, we'd have heard something about it. - Lock it up. - Yeah Dennis, lock it up. - All of you lock it up, I'm getting stupider just listening to you. - But the power-- - You wanna hear about power? You wanna hear about real power? Tell me, who is it you thinks got the most power in this town? - (snaps fingers) Your dad. - You'd think so, but not really. Sure, he's got a way with words, sure he packs 'em in every Sunday. Sin all you want, just so long as you have a personal relationship with Christ (laughs). Meanwhile, those people that actually do good things in this world, well fuck 'em, right? Fuck 'em if they don't fit your mold. - What does this have to do with Dad? What does this have to do with anything? - Oh Dad, right. Well, he's a servant of the Lord. Just another servant. And he'd tell you the same thing. A servant following some instructions in a 2,000 year old book. So who's got the real power in this town? Me. Tell 'em Dennis. - Me? - Yeah, you. Ever read that? - Uh, Wise Blood. - Right, Flannery O'Connor. She's a prophet. It was your brother Joseph gave me that before he went walk-about. Back when I was the good boy. I've read it a hundred times if I've read it once. It's about understanding, it's about knowin' what's what, it's about truth, capital T truth. - Truth? - There are all kinds of truth, but behind all of them, there is only one truth, and that is that there's no truth. Now that I own this garage, I'm the one with the power. I'm the one who saves souls, and that's the truth. - We fix cars, Carl, not souls. - Turn to page 47, I've got it marked. - "A man with a good car need no redemption. "Nobody with a good car needs to be justified." - I don't get it. - You see, a man who doesn't obey the law, well, he's an outlaw. A man who doesn't obey a God, he's just normal. Heck, a man who doesn't even believe in God is just someone who's got a different opinion. But a man without a car, well he's nothin' at all. - A man without a car is just a man without a car. - Really? How far can you go without a car? How far away is the closest store from here, six miles? You gonna walk that every day? You might as well be a caveman. You got a car, you've got what people 150 years ago would think was magic. It would count as 20 servants, 20 slaves, more even! Servants, slaves. That's power. Being a servant? That's for suckers. - This is a service station, Carl. (soulful rock music) - Grace. - Shh, you're okay. - What day is it? - It's Thursday. - What date? - What do you mean? - What date? - Okay! (strange metallic screeching) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (heavy breathing) What happened? - You hit your head. Think it happened when you stepped on that trap. - Why are there traps up here? - I don't know. - You shouldn't be up here. - I'm pregnant Joseph, I'm not an invalid. You, you'll be okay. I still wanna get you to a hospital. - We can't, the cars are dead. - All of them? - Anything with a battery. - You'll be okay, least 'til tomorrow when things are back to normal. - You and Dale. - Me and Dale. - And Dale Junior. - Joseph, don't. - You think Dale's gonna be a good dad? - I think he's a good man. He's not perfect, but who is? - I'm sorry, I just never imagined you joining the Campbell clan. - Well, I never pictured you disappearing for six years. (melancholy instrumental music) Where did you go? - I don't know. - Why don't you have a seat. - I feel like stretching my legs. - Feel like stretching the truth, too? - Seems like a running theme today, is all. - That's not my style. - Telling the truth. - No, running. - Odd thing to say for a guy who's been AWOL for over half a decade. - Yeah, now that sounds like a lot of running if you ask me. - Mm-hmm. - Nobody asked you. - Why don't we try this? You drop the stoic, tough guy bullshit and just tell us the truth. The truth, Joseph. It can go a long way. (soft folk music) - What's with the traps in the garage? - Traps? I didn't put any-- - I did. - You? - Yeah, been noticing a lotta 'coons lurking around town lately. - Coons. - Yeah, can't be too careful with them coons. Lots of people think they're cute, especially the young ones. - We've never had a problem before. - And I'm not too keen on having one now. - What were you doing up there anyway? - Callin' your brother. - Did you get a hold of him? - Yeah, he said he's gonna-- - No, I mean what were you doing in the loft? That's not where the phone is, but it is where the traps are. - I heard something up there. - Something or someone? - I don't know. - You heard him boys. Time to go coon hunting. - Gun's in the truck. Stand your ground brothers! - I got a right to protect what's mine. - I'll go too. Just to be sure it's okay. - This is wrong. - I suggest you step back right now. - Let me go out there. - I think it's best if you just stay here with the rest of the women. - To hell with this, I'm goin' too. - Cooey! Cooey coon! Come on out, little coony coon. (suspenseful instrumental music) - You don't think they'll actually shoot whoever's out there, do you? - You heard the man, who's gonna stop him? - Somebody has to. - Let's just find 'em and get the hell out of here. - Where's the fun in that? - Come on out, little coon, show us that scary little coon face! Show us how you like to beg! Cooey! Coon! Come on out, little coony coon. - Carl come on, this isn't you. - You haven't been payin' much attention, have you. - Carl! Over there! (heavy breathing) - Hey. Just come down, we don't wanna start any trouble. - We don't wanna start, but you better believe we'll end it. - Carl, I don't think that thing is human. - Now you're gettin' with the program. (gun shot) - I'm gonna go out there. - No, no, that's too dangerous. - So? - They're drunk and trigger happy. You can't go out there and risk your life for some stranger. - I don't know if it is a stranger. - (laughs) That'll teach those coons to sniff around here. - Carl, you just killed someone. - I thought you said it wasn't human. Dale come on, help me scoop up what's left, Alan you give Ray a call, tell him we got some trash that needs to be disposed of. - What do you mean, it? What did you see out there? - Nothing. - Joseph. - I didn't see anything, but I think I know what's out there. - Does this have something to do with where you went? - More like when. - Dennis, did you see what I saw? - I don't know. Either way, I wish I didn't. - Coon was craftier than I thought. - For Christ's sake Carl, can't you see that's not a-- - For Christ's sake, some nerve. You think Christ gives one flying-- - Carl! - Fuck about what goes on down here? - Carl! - We're on our little buddy, sorry to break it to you. Survival of the fittest. - Carl. - Not now! - Carl, shut up and look. (fearful breathing) (ominous instrumental music) - My God. (gun shot) - It? - Yeah, it. - Would you care to elaborate on that? - Elaborate? What's to elaborate on? What part of it don't you understand? - It's just the part where it sounds like you and your buddies, you drunk too much toilet gin, then you did something you shouldn't have done, and then you tried to cover it up. - Other than that, what's the expression, total crystal? - Well you guys got all the answers. What you need me for? - No, no, no, no. It's you that needs us. - So why don't we try it one more time. Would you care to elaborate on that, on the "it" part? - Can I get a cup of that coffee now? - This coffee? Trust me, you don't want any of this coffee. - No, don't, don't look at me. I'm a tea guy. - So, once again, with feeling this time. (pained breathing) (dramatic instrumental music) - Some thing? - You heard me. - And he shot Alan? - It's not a he, it's a-- - I shot him, okay, I did it, can we just get him to the hospital, okay. - We can't. - What do you mean, we can't? - The cars won't start, remember. - The generator, we'll jump one. - It won't fix the batteries. - Neutron bomb, I'm telling ya. - Dennis, shut up! - You're a nurse, can't you get the bullet out of his leg? - This isn't a movie Carl, taking out that bullet could kill him. (pained yelling) - She's right, we need to get him to the emergency room. We could call your brother. - Nobody goes outside! - We could rig up one of those old wagons, it's only five miles away-- - I said nobody goes outside! At least not until dawn. - Carl, if we don't get him to a hospital, he could die! - If we go outside, we all die. (pained yelling) - What did you see out there? - Something that human eyes were not meant to see. Dad was right, he was right all along. - About what? - Demons. I'm talkin' about demons. (crickets chirping) We make it through the night. It'll hide and we can get some place safe. - How can you possibly know that? - Oh, I know. - It isn't here to hurt us, not like you think. - And how the hell would you know that? You weren't out there. What aren't you tellin' us, Joseph? You aren't going anywhere. - Look, if I die, I die. What are you so afraid of? - I don't have to run from anything, because I don't believe in anything. - I'm the one who gave you that book Carl, remember? - And for that, you have my thanks. - Carl, please put the gun down. - Do not doubt for one second that I will do everything in my power to protect what is deemed righteous. - Fine. - Well, we know he didn't shoot. I mean, obviously you're still here, so if you're going for tension, you kinda deflated that a bit. - You asked me what happened, I'm telling you what happened. - Sure, but are you telling us all that happened? - It's all connected, Joseph. All connected. - And that's what this is about for you, right? Drawing the connections? - We don't draw the connections. Not us, not you. They're already there. All we do is shine a light. All we do is-- - Try to draw them out of me. - And is that so bad? (Tanya crying) - He's gonna die, isn't he? - He's lost a lot of blood. - You think that thing was what Carl said? - A demon? I didn't see it. But the way they describe it... - They saw what they wanted to see. They saw what was in their hearts. (Tanya crying) - I don't think I'm ready to be judged by God yet. - You okay? - Okay? Are you insane? Your brother's bleeding to death, there's some thing crawling around out there that Carl thinks is a demon, and he's got us trapped in here at gun point, what part of any of that could possibly be okay? - Gracie, listen-- - Don't Gracie me. Your brother has gone off the rails, and there you are, backing him up like always. - He's trying to protect us. - Oh, the who's gonna protect us from him? - Listen, I know you're scared, okay? But he's my brother. He's never steered me wrong before. - Maybe he has. Maybe you just didn't notice. (loud thud) - So what did you find upstairs? - Jack shit. - Jack shit? Yeah, I don't think I know him, shit, is that a common family name around here? Can I borrow your pen? Shit, how do you spell that, is it with an Sch or an Sh? - Boy, you're a real live one, aren't you? - Uh, You know that's a good point. Maybe the question is, who that was with you that night is still a live one, and who is a dead one? - You know what? That's not funny. - None of this is funny, Dale. - Then why are you treating it all like it's some joke! - We've just been following your lead. If you think it's time to play nice with us, we can return the favor. (mournful instrumental music) (Dale crying) - Help me prop him up a bit. (grunting) Sorry, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. (heavy breathing) Just hang in there, alright? Just hang in a little longer. - Water. - Okay, alright. - Hey baby. - Tanya. - Yeah babe, I'm here. - You. - Yeah. - You... ...and Carl. - You know? (Tanya crying) - Shh. Hey, hey, shh.... Don't cry. - Why didn't you say somethin'? Why didn't you smack me upside my head? - 'Cause I love you. I couldn't lose you. (Tanya crying) I love you even though you... Even though you shot me. (hysterical laughter) - Baby. - I love you, Tanya. - You forgive me? No, no, no, no! No! (agonized scream) (ominous instrumental music) (high-pitched synthetic notes) - Take me back. Please. I understand now. Tanya. - Damn it, Dennis! Isn't it enough that one person's gotten shot tonight? - Your brother's gonna get us all killed, Dale. - I wouldn't worry about Carl. Carl's always done the right thing. - Tell that to Alan. - Alan's fine, it's just a flesh wound. My brother's going to get-- - Alan's your brother too. - I said he'll be fine! - You see anything? - Nothing that isn't supposed to be there. - You know this used to be my father's-- well, my parents' room before... - This is, it's just temporary. You know, me and Grace staying here. - You know when it comes right down to it, everything's just temporary. - I need to talk to my brother. - Nobody's stoppin' you-- - Alone. - What happened? - It came for me. It came for me downstairs. I was just sitting there. (steady heartbeat) (eerie instrumental music) - I'm ashamed to call you my brother. We always knew you weren't strong enough for this. - Stop saying that. You're not supposed to be saying that. - I know exactly what I'm supposed to be saying! I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing! And by God, you should too by now. - I do know. I do! - Prove yourself. - I am the shepherd, and I have sheep that are not of this flock. I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice, so there will be one flock. - So there will be one flock. - One shepherd. - One shepherd. - For this reason-- - For that reason. - My father loves me. - My father loves me. - For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory. - For thine is the kingdom-- - Forever. - The power, and the glory. - For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory. Forever and ever. - And the glory. - Amen. - Forever and ever, amen. For this reason, the father loves me! I do know, I do! (steady heartbeat) (loud thud) (eerie instrumental music) (the Being roars) - Get a grip man, you must have just fallen asleep. - I did not fall asleep. That thing is here to judge us, you hear me? It's here to judge us all. - You better come downstairs. (eerie instrumental music) - I saw it. I saw it all! - What did you see, Tanya? - Somebody wanna tell me what the hell's going on here? What the fuck. - Alan's gone. - What do you mean he's gone, he's right there. - He's dead Carl. Your brother's dead. - Oh my god, it can't be. - Dead? - And he wouldn't be if you'd just let us get him help. - No Joseph, it's not his fault, it's not anybody's fault, it was an accident! - Like hell, it's his fault. - You shut the hell up! - Stop it, both of you. - You've got no idea what's going on right now, do you? - And you do? - Oh I know. The apocalypse has come, Joseph. The end of the world. I'm actually glad Alan's gone. I'm happy he's been spared the tribulation that's on the way! - The end of the world, tribulation, apocalypse, listen to yourself. - Every death is the end of one world. A small world, but it's always a small world, after all (laughs). - You shut up, bitch. This is your fault. - The fault is yours, Carl Campbell. You're the one that wanted to go hunting. - I said shut up! - Sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted. Your little world ends tonight. - That's enough out of you. - Carl, Carl! This is a bad idea. - You got a better one? You wanna leave this possessed bitch in here with us? - No, it's just, we let the law take care of her, we let Ray take care of her! - Fine. She can take her chances outside. - Don't be afraid Carl Campbell. Soon you will see as I see. Soon you will see everything. (loud thud) (crickets chirping) - Dale, we need to get Alan's body outside. - Outside, why? - We need to make it look like an accident. - It was an accident. - We can't rely on Ray for everything. - He's our brother! We're not gonna put his body outside like some sack of garbage! - Our brother is in a better world, and that is just a reminder that we aren't. - Carl. - Listen up. I for one and am not gonna survive the end of days just to wind up in a prison cell as an accomplice to murder. - That thing is outside! - That thing is everywhere. Forget it. We'll bury him. Grab a shovel. No, not you. You. - Me? - I'm gonna need some help. - So he just left you there, alone. - You aren't paying attention. I wasn't alone. We are never alone. - No, we aren't alone, are we? Now why don't you tell us who was there with you. - Grace, I need you to distract Dale. - Joseph, I can't. - Just long enough for me to get to the barn. - I said I can't. - You heard Carl. You think he's gonna let us live? - I can't Joseph, Dale is my husband. - It's not my fault. - Yes it is. I thought you were dead. - I'm sorry. You don't know how sorry I am. - If you want me to help you, I need to trust you. You need to tell me everything. Everything, Joseph. You know what it is, don't you? You were talking to it, I saw you. You told it you wanted it to take you back, you said you understood it. Back, back where? Where? No more secrets. - When I went away... It wasn't to a place. Not like we understand it. It was more of a, a not-place, or a... ...a no place. - You're not making sense. - The truth doesn't make any sense. Six years ago, I was in the barn. I was standing there, it was, it was dark. I felt like nothing, like nothing I did mattered, and I wanted out of here so bad. And that's when it came. (dramatic instrumental music) - It. You mean like what's out there? - And it told me-- - It spoke to you? - Not in words. Not even in thoughts exactly, in.... ...in... in being. - Being? - And I knew it had heard me. It had heard my heart, and it could take me some place where I would matter. - Where is that place? - Here, three days ago. - How is that possible? - That's just a fraction of it, Grace. When I was away, when I was in the no-place, I knew everything. I knew everyone, I knew every-when. I was... just like it was. - What is it, Joseph? Is it really a demon? - Carl thinks it's a demon, but it's beyond that. Beyond our labels. It's not bound by space and time, not like we are. And I think hidden, those like it are around us all the time, we just can't see them. - Like angels? - No, angels, demons, they're beyond that. - They're beyond, you mean there's more of them? - Dale's dad told me something when I was younger. He asked me, how many waves are there on the ocean? And I said too many to count. You know what he told me? - It doesn't matter, all that counts is the ocean. - He told you that too. And that's what it's like. It's like a wave on an ocean. Just one that we can't see. - And it brought you home. Okay. I'll take care of Dale, just-- (door opens) - I heard what you said. And I remember now the last time I saw you, when you went away, and the power went out that time too. Let's go, we're getting the hell out of here. (gun cocks) (crickets chirping) I think we're clear. - Shit. - What's wrong? - It's dead. I made sure of it. Dale, put that shotgun down, nice and slow. Over there where I can see you. I was expecting you Joseph, hell, I was looking forward to it, but you? What can I say? You always were the weak one. Now get on your knees. - Carl, you don't understand. - I understand plenty. - Carl, where's Dennis? - I said I understand plenty! Like, you know what day this is? It's Judgment Day. Not like I thought it was, not the way Dad always said it would be, no. This is a personal kind of Judgment Day. - Carl, what did you do? - That's what that thing is bringing us, judgment. We all face judgment, and we all do it alone. Like your brother did. - Carl, where's my brother? - I told him, I told you all! We stay together, we'll be fine. But Dennis, he had to try and run. He betrayed us. - Carl you can't-- - He faced his judgment, and he came up wanting. I will not stand for betrayal. Not from you, Joseph. Not even from my own blood. - Carl wait. - Prepare to be judged. (clang) - Not today, motherfucker. Let's go before he wakes up. I said let's go! (otherworldly humming) Joseph. (mesmerizing alternative music) Joseph, no. It didn't bring you back to take you away again. To take you to some no-place. Then take me too! - What? - Take me too! - Gracie. Gracie! Grace. Grace! Grace! (otherworldly humming) You send that thing back to hell! (gun shot) (dramatic instrumental music) (birds chirping) - Joseph? Dale? What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? - I haven't seen you in so long. - Grace, the baby. - Baby, what baby? You aren't making any sense. - Why, why are we here? - It's okay. We're okay, we're okay, we're okay. - Where's Carl? Joseph, where's my brother? - Nowhere. (mellow alternative music) She's sleeping. I got through to your brother Ray. They'll be here soon. (Dale crying) - She doesn't remember anything. About me, about us. How is that possible? - I think, I think it's a kind of mercy. - And the baby? - That too. I think that's what it does. It doles out mercy, in its way. - That's a funny kind of mercy. - Its ways are not our ways. - You sound like my dad. - Maybe he's right. - No, no Joseph, that's not enough. What about us? What about our mercy? - Maybe... The mercy isn't for us to receive this time. It's for us to give. - That's easy for you to say. They're never gonna believe us, huh. - It doesn't matter who believes it. I'm not even sure I believe it. But the truth is beyond belief. - That's easy for you to say. - So that's your story. That's what you're going with. - You said you wanted the truth, and this is it. - Yeah, it's just a little hard to swallow, that's all. - It's not my fault. - We found Dennis Byrne, he's alive. We got him in the Medivac to the hospital in Binghamton. - Status? - Rough, but he should pull through. - Okay thanks, notify the local Five-O. - Got it. (phone ringing) - Tell me you've got good news. - Well, I wouldn't call it good news exactly. We found Dennis Bryne, and Alan Campbell, what's left of him. - Alright thanks. Let me know if you get anything else. - Copy that. - Sir, I think you need to see this. (birds chirping) - My dear, I believe you've got one hell of a story for us. (panting) (whispering) - I'll handle the other one. - You're free to go. - Just like that. - Just like that. - What happened? - Well, I think you know the answer to that better than we ever will, but we have the answers we came for. - And that's enough? - It'll have to be. Have a nice life! - I grilled them over and over again. Grace too. Their stories match up. But there's not a shred of evidence to prove or disprove any of it, it's all this like, bullshit about bright lights and demons, and I don't know how to do that. - Bury it. - No Dad, I can't do that. - You heard me. The truth will not come out. It can never come out. You understand me? You know what? They died for what they believe in. Be proud of them. They've gone to a better place. You don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it by now, say that they left fucking suicide notes and that the devil made 'em do it. Say that lightning struck 'em at the same moment. I don't give a shit. But do not question me, do not. - And Joseph Byrne, he just gets to walk away? - Do it. - You think he's gonna stay quiet with all this? - You will and I will, and in time, it'll all just go away, just like before. - You guys need anything else? - I think we're good. So you believe they're telling the truth? - They believe it. That's good enough for us for now. - What about Carl Campbell? - He'll turn up or he won't. I'm sure the local yokels will pin the rest on him. - Or they won't. The saw is family, as they say in situations such as this. - Either way, it's not our problem. Let the little people deal with it. Are you hungry? - Yeah, yeah, starving, what you got in mind? - Ever heard of the Spiedie? - No. - It's a local delicacy. It's like a shish kebab sandwich. They're supposed to be famous for them. - Well I'm game, let me call this in. (phone ringing) - News? - We're all done here. Nothing concrete, but we're getting closer. It's our bogey. - You're certain? - Certain as we're gonna get, Director Hook. - Get more certain. - Yes sir. We're on it. I'll be sure to contain it. - See that you do. - Everything alright? - Yeah good, let's eat. - Let's. (tuneful country music) - We all have over the last 24 hours or so slipped into a coma of confusion and speculation. I've heard some of the stories going around. They go from the divine to the absurd. I think this happened, or I heard that this happened. What has actually happened has been documented by the proper authorities, and I give you my word, every bit of it is true. We have slipped into a mode where, where isolation and fear are so familiar that we've become comfortable with it. That fear has become our addiction. Make no mistake, the devil has, has set foot in this town, on your ground. All we need to do is but ask, and God will cleanse our spirits and our minds. Look to the good book first, always. Get the devil in a choke hold. Remind him, we are here to serve God. God's thoughts are not our thoughts. Neither is his ways our ways, as heaven is above the earth, so are God's ways higher, his thoughts are higher than our thoughts, yours or mine. ♪ In the end ♪ ♪ It's all the same ♪ ♪ In the end, it's all the same ♪ ♪ In the end ♪ ♪ They'll know your name ♪ ♪ In the end, they'll know your name ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see the devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ ♪ Once again ♪ ♪ It's all the same ♪ ♪ Once again, it's all the same ♪ ♪ In the end ♪ ♪ It's just a game ♪ ♪ In the end, it's just a game ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see the devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see the devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ ♪ In the end ♪ ♪ It's just a game ♪ ♪ In the end, it's just a game ♪ ♪ Once again ♪ ♪ They'll know your name ♪ ♪ In the end, they'll know your name ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see the devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ ♪ Gonna go and see the devil again ♪ ♪ Don't you know he only wanted a friend ♪ (invigorating rock music) The truth never comes out, do you understand me?
