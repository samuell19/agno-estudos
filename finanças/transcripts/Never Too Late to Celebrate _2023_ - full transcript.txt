No. No, your singing was very sweet. They loved it. No, at the end, you say this phrase, "Colorín something." "Y Colorín Colorado, este cuento se ha terminado." "Se ha terminado." - That one? - Yes! Yes, that... Ah... I haven't heard that in so long. My dad used to read me bedtime stories and he would end with that, but I... I never knew what it meant. It's a Spanish folk saying. It roughly translates to "That's the end of the story." Kind of like our "And they lived happily ever after." It's very beautiful. Yes, it is. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Um, I should get back to the kids. - Of course, yeah. - Ah... Oh, uh, how come you never asked your dad to just translate it for you? Um...

I'd rather wait till you had a moment to come along, and just like Dad planned to do. Did talk ever talk about going back to Mexico again? How do you mean? Well, I mean, he grew up there, but isn't it kind of weird that he never instilled, you know, the culture or traditions? Becoming an American citizen meant the world to your father. He fully embraced his life here, and assimilating for him meant leaving certain parts behind. I can't believe it's been three years. Huh! Yeah. Huh! Good morning! -Ugh... -Ugh? Why are you so glum? -Apartment hunting in this market is bleak! So little space for so much money. -Ooh, forced coziness! Oh, I think that would actually be really good for you and Evan.

Your book. - Oh, thank you. I'll tell you what. Let me treat you to some coffee. There's this place around the corner. They make the best horchata lattes. What's that? - What's horchata? - Yeah.

Okay, so tell me about you. You are an elementary school teacher by day, but by night you teach adult Spanish classes? That's me! So do you live in the area? Uh, originally, yes. And then I moved when I was younger. I spent my twenties in California. And, uh, yeah, my brother and his family all still live here. So what brought you back? Thank you. Uh, phew. Well, my life was flipped upside-down about a year ago, and I am not gonna bore you with those details. Thank you. For the horchata. -Of course. So tell me, what about you? You have a busy schedule and you're taking my Spanish classes... Are you a glutton for punishment? -It's in my DNA. I mean, what do you expect? My dad's an immigrant from Mexico, so, you know, he worked himself to the bone and... I'm sorry. I think about my dad a lot around my birthday. I'm sorry, it's your birthday? No! No, my birthday's not for another month, but, um, I'm turning 30. It's a milestone birthday. It's definitely weird that he's not gonna be here for it. Yeah, I hear that dads and daughters, it's a thing. Well, my niece's quince is this weekend, and my brother, ugh! He is just going on and on about how his little girl is becoming a woman. That's very sweet. Yeah, it is. How was your quince? Mm, I didn't have one. - What? - No! Well, my mom is American and my dad was very Americanized by the time I came along, so no quince. You know, that's a common story for a lot of Latin immigrants. They want to assimilate and just not be known as different, so... Whoosh! You know, it's kind of crazy, though, 'cause not only did I not have a quince, I've never even been to one! You're kidding. Well, that makes sense. Why, you've never tried horchata! Well, I'm glad we fixed that! What about a double quince? A what? You said that you were turning 30, right? Yeah. So, you should have a double quinceañera to celebrate. Two times fifteen. Come on, what better way to honour your father than to embrace your Mexican heritage? Did you see me in your Spanish class? I don't think a fiesta's in my future!

You know, for me, food isn't just food. -Ay, here we go... -He's been hearing this his whole life. - This is the whole speech. - But it's true. I mean, food is a way of expressing who we are. It tells our story, and this place has been a part of our family's story for generations. And, you know, food is also a way of expressing love. You want to try? - Oh, yes! - Go! Uh, which one do I try first? I think you should follow your heart. Oof. Um... Are you kidding me? Oh my goodness, that is delicious! - Yes! - Yes! Manolo, will you please cater my quince? I would be honoured. - Yes! - Ha-ha! - Aw... - Thank you! - Well, congratulations. - Oh! -For landing the best chef in town. No, thank you. CAMILA: Thank you for sneaking away during lunch. MAREN: Never mind that. Tell me all about Javi. Is that short for "Javier"? Does he have a last name or does he go by "Javi" like Oprah? -[laughs] I don't know! What I do know is he can treat a girl to a nice dinner. I can tell you that. -Cam, that's a date. -It was at his brother's restaurant. -That's even more of a date! You've met his brother twice now! -Okay, hear me out. Javi is sweet and he's charming and we have a lot of fun together, but... Principal Lee? - Hi! - Oh! - Hello! - So good to see you! - Hello! - Hello! How are my two favourite former students doing these days? Good! Busy. I have a lot of patients and not enough time in the day. - But we're good! - [laughter] So I heard you're keeping my mom around a little longer. She told me all about the hiring freeze and how she had to postpone retirement. Oh, not at all. Your mother came to me saying that she didn't feel ready to retire yet. If it was up to me, I'd keep her forever. Anyway, girls, I better get going. It was lovely bumping into you. - Bye, Principal Lee! - Bye. Huh! I don't get it. Why doesn't my mom want to retire? -Well, besides you and work she doesn't have a lot going on right now. -Alright, then why not just say that? -I dunno, cut her some slack. Maybe she's just embarrassed to admit it. Or she doesn't want you worrying about her. -That is a very astute observation. -Thank you. Just keep taking her to those dance classes. Maybe she'll figure out retirement can be fun. ♪ Look at all of these beautiful colours! These Peruvian lilies are gorgeous! -Oh, and the peonies! And the peonies! -To die for! Let's incorporate them both. -Oh, love those. Javi! Thank you so much for coming. JAVI: Yeah, of course. It's so good to see you. Well, this is Team Flower Power. Alright, girls, what's next? Uh, we need vases on every table. Oh, and there is also the tradition where you lay the flower wreath on my head. [Javi chuckles] Wow! Someone's been taking notes. - I have! I told you! - [laughs] Okay. Oh, uh, usually the birthday girl picks her favourite flower for the wreath ceremony. Oh! So, which one is your favourite? Oh. Um... You know, I really like this one. JAVI: Good eye. That is the flower of Mexico. Really? SHERRY: That was your father's favourite flower. Did you know that? No, I didn't. He chose dahlias for my wedding bouquet. -It's kismet! -Okay, why don't you girls head over to the café? I'll place the order and join you later. - I'll see you guys there. - SHERRY: See you later. CAMILA: Love you. Thank you. Bye. - I'll help you find someone. - Great.

He is in there alone with your mother right now. -Stop! -He could be asking for your hand in marriage! -He is literally just helping us plan the quince. - That's it! - [phone buzzes] Ooh, it's Evan! He's got a hot tip. A friend of a friend is thinking of renting out his condo. - Go! - Mind if I jet? - Love you! Bye! - Love you! Javi, I meant to ask you the other day, are you looking for a permanent position at the school? Because I can put in a good word. That's very kind of you. I, um... I don't know if I'm gonna be there long-term. Oh... -Thank you. -Sure thing. I'm just so glad Cami signed up for your class. -Oh, being bilingual, it opens up a lot of doors. -Well, yeah, that too. But honestly, I just want her to have more fun in her life. She puts so much pressure on herself. Always has. You know, in the, uh... pie chart of life, Camila is like one very big slice of work pie. [laughs] And now I'm craving pie. -Me, too. But maybe you can relate. I just... I feel like sometimes it's easy to get so used to a work routine that it kind of becomes daunting to think about anything else outside of that. Hmm! CAMILA: This is just what I needed after the day I had at work. Okay, how good is that? - Mmm! - I know! - What's it called again? - It's pronounced "horchata." Your dad would have loved this. Mom, can I talk to you about something? Sure. [Latin music playing in background] So... I ran into Principal Lee. Oh, really? That's nice. What did she have to say? Well, she told me that they're not in a hiring freeze and that you decided not to retire. So why are you putting it off? Especially after everything with Dad. I mean, we're not promised tomorrow, so why are you waiting? [sighs] For years, your dad and I dreamed of retirement. All the exciting things we were gonna do! But without him to share it with, it just... seems pointless. Mom, I'm sorry. I'm not sure who I am without him, Cam. And at least if I am working, I know how to fill up my day. Well, Mom, I think you're doing great. I mean, look at you. You took up a new hobby. I mean, you're dancing now. You've been taking night classes. You're enjoying that, right? Very much. And you're making new friends, like Rafael. Oh, Rafael is such a sweet guy... with a jawline to die for. Um, but... I miss your dad. Oh, Mom. I do, too. But... I do feel like bringing new people into your life and having fun, that doesn't diminish the love that you have for Dad. I mean, he would want that for us. Right? [salsa music playing] [breathing heavily] Phew! That was some sabor. What's "sabor"? Flavour. You added mucho spice to those moves. You were just so easy to follow. It's all about connection. You were connected to me, and together we were connected to the music. Great work, Sherry. Great instruction, Rafael. Thank you. This was the highlight of my week, and I'll see you next class. -Wait! Before you go... How would you like to come and see my advanced students' recital this weekend? A sneak peek of where you're headed if you keep up with your classes. Uh, me, an advanced student? -Well, sure. Why not? Afterwards, we can grab some arepas at my favourite Colombian spot. Oh! Oh... Uh... Thank you for the invite. Um... I just, uh...
