Here's a dog. 10 points. Two or three flags, that's 15 points each. 460, 470, and 30 is 500. I win again! I don't want to play this dumb game anymore. Anyway there's hardly anymoreanimals, just dumb buildings. So count flags. They're worth 15, and there's lots of 'em. No fair! You can't count golf course flags. Daddy, golf course flags don't count, do they? According to internationalcar game rules, the driver must remain neutral. Coward. TRF Corporation, Microchip International. Boy, it sounds like computer heaven! Computers don't go to heaven. What's a dumbgirl know about computers? Robbie, I told you notto call your sister names. She only wants to be likeyou because she loves you. No, I don't. Matt, I can't believe it's for real. Executive in charge of special projects. I still can't believeI'm joining a corporation. Oh, you'll be just fine. They need fresh blood. You're not sorry you're doing this, are you? No, I'm just sorry you had to put up with all those lean years. My crazy hours, Midwest winters,up to our elbows in snow. They weren't lean years, Matt. No, they were, they were. It's time we Winslows had a taste of the good life, huh guys? Yeah! I liked the snow. You didn't have to shovel it. Hey kids, that's the building where your dad's going to work. I don't like that working at either. Why not? 'Cause I can't see the people inside. MATT This is it! What do you think? I can't wait to wait to see it. It's our castle, honey! Come on, Elbert! It is so beautiful! I told you you'd like it. You like it, huh? What I tell you? Wait 'till you see the backyard. Big backyard, lots of grass. Oh, honey, it's evenbetter than I remembered it. It's all ours. Along with the mortgage payments. Hey, Chrissy, wait for me! - Well. - Yeah? Better late than never. Have you ever seen such a gorgeous kitchen? Matt, I am going to cook youthe best meal you've ever had! What's that sound? Where do you want this thing? Whatever it is. Oh, careful, careful there. Holding the 21st century in your hands there. Wait a minute. Hold it. What? Albert, get off the chair. Matt, I want you to takeall your computer things and your inventions into the new lab at work. Pat, this is my baby. It's part of the family, Pat. Matt, I don't care. I want this house to be home, not a lab. Because I love you, I'lltell you what I'll do. I'll take it to the lab. It's a great idea. What you got there, games? No, inventory. You guys lose any of my stuff, I'll know it. Hey, We don't lose nothing. Oh, yeah? I'm already missing a candy bar. Well, look around. It could be anywhere. Kids today. I don't know. I know it's hard tosleep in a strange place. But you just gotta get used to it. Here we sit likebirds in the wilderness, birds in the wilderness, birds in the wilderness. Here we sit like birds in thewilderness, waiting to be fed. Ah, finally. The pizza man. I don't think It is the pizza man, Matt. They usually come to the front door. Maybe it's a zombie. Mommy? Hey, hey, hey. I'm gonna give you a knucklesandwich, you little character. Sounds like a job forthe head of the household. Wanna check it out, Pat? Absolutely not. Matt, over here. Zombies, definitely. They do stuff like that. Come on, Robbie. Cut it out. Stay back. Dad! What is this? Hey! How you doing? Hey, how are you? How are you? Oh, look. Is this Janey? - Great mask! - You really scared us! I had you scared there, didn't I? Yeah. Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did. Got you good. All right, now look. I brought this over for you here. The first one is free. But after that, we got a little charge. Thomas, you haven'tchanged a bit since College. Still a primitive,tasteless sense of humor. Ooh. But, a highly advancedgourmet sense of food, huh? OK, kids. Eat wholly over hard sufaces, kids. The masks were Tom's idea. Not mine. We're getting ready for a big costume ball later this month at the club. Really? Anyway, welcome to paradise. Aw, thanks. Tell you what, let's get some wine. I'll show my kitchen. This is great, I'm telling you. You know, when I heard that youwere coming, I was so happy. You have an idea. - Aw, thanks, dude. You did a lot of arm twisting out, I'll bet. Not at all! Word has spread of yourinvention, I'm telling you. When the company heard, they wanted to get you right into the project. You-- you brilliant, renegade,un-patented genius, you! You're probably right. They heard about my sensors, right? They sure have. And I'll tell you something--with a huge corporation behind you like this, it's going to be great. And I'll sell it. See? You look good, I look good. So I'm just taking care of numero uno here. A song! A song to celebrate, huh? What do you say? All right! It'll be like old times, huh? Patricia, the struggling music major. Remember, we used to singaround that horrible, old, upright piano in the dorm? I remember. Is this the same one? Just the same budget. So it's a little out of tune. Just a little? Don't worry about it. The days of out of tunepianos and beat up furniture is over for you two, so just relax. To friends. To success. Cheers. The days out of tunepianos and beat up furniture are over, Matt. Squawk! Said the parrot, as theyfinally sighted the island. And they lived happily ever after. And bought a condominium in Miami Beach. Oh, Daddy. Oh, daddy. All right. Little sleep there, little sleep dust there. Give me a kiss. Now it's time to sleep withthe angels, my little cookie. OK? - OK. All right. Night-night. Night-night. Who's winning? The Plasmic warriorsgot three of my fighters. But I just blasted their wholemothership into hyperspace. And now that the galaxy is safe for democracy, you can go to sleep, right? Right. So if I just saved the galaxy, how come I can't go to a Halloweenparty Jimmy's going to? Who says you can't? Jimmy said members only can go. It's at some stupid club. Are they members? Gonna be. He says everybody that's anybody around here belongs to the club. Or is trying to. And what do you think about that? I think Jimmy's a nerd. Well, try to keep an open mind, old bean. It's one of your best traits. Go to sleep. Welcome,commander of Earth forces. Be advised, invaders approaching your galaxy. Hi, sailor. How are the kids? The kids are fine. The house is fine. The dog is fine. Everything is fine. Do you have any idea how much I love you? I feel like I haven't seenyou in a million years. Oh, but the kids. Hey. How ya feeling, babe? How was the first night? Slept like a baby. Matt Winslow, meet Larry Ferris. How you doing? Larry is my sponsor at Steaming Springs. You know, the club? Oh, right. Thomas told me all about you. Well, sometimes Petersonspeaks before he thinks. Micro-digitech would likeit the other way around. Welcome aboard. Thanks. Your buddy Ferris' warmthis positively reptilian. He's a great guy once you get to know him. I think he's a littleticked off because he had to ride in my old jalopy today. You guys don't usually carpool? Ferris? No, no, that's my boss. I think, you know, he had a flat tire, and he's a little touchy,probably, because of that. Ferris in my junk, he must have been dying. Grace Henderson, I want you tomeet my old fraternity buddy, Matt Winslow. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Winslow. It's Matt. I've prepared anoperations manual for you. It's on your desk. Thank you. She is a marvel. Now, this is my office. Believe me, it is not that much to look at, so we'll move right on to yours.- OK. Over here.You're practically next door. Here we are. Not too bad for starters, huh? Not bad. Now, let's go see your baby. OK. OK, cut it! Like I said, the governmentwants a man on Venus in the next three years. And when he gets there, he's going to be wearing a suit made by Micro-Digitech and perfected by you, my friend. What do you think? Well, that's interesting. Darn right. But to get there, you know, it's going to be a bit of a hot time. We want to make sure he doesn'tturn into a human French fry. OK, watch this. He's also armed. - All right. - Ready? OK, here we go. Power up. Ooh! That hurts, that hurts. Nothing will stand up to that. Killer bricks, huh? Watch this. I've set the new shield in place. Now, by the way, how do you like your steaks? Charred or obliterated? Medium rare. Go ahead, fellas. Is that a suit, or that a suit? It's not bad. Not bad? Not bad at all. What sort of on board systemsdo you have on it now? Well, uh, on the suit we have radio, weapons, oxygen. Everything to keep the guy alive. It's going to be up to youto add the final touches. Right. An onboard computer hooked up to my sensors. That's right. We want this suit to becompletely self-contained. We want it to think. The guy inside has got to be like a pilot, not like a salami stuffed in a skin. Give me and my team twoweeks, and this suit will think. It'll inform its occupant of everything vital, life threatening going on around him. Automatically. Temperature, atmospherw-- evenother beings within range. Other beings within range? You mean it'll be able to sense if there's something non-human out there? My friend, we are going to build a suit for the 21st century. I mean, the tour is darn near over, right? Right. Well, Mary turned me on tothis great new furniture store. Can you imagine what this place would look like completely redone? Chrissy, come down for breakfast! Well, I guess the couch couldbe recovered if, in fact, we can't afford to buy a new one. You listening to me, Matt? Mm. Matt, read my lips. The place looks like a fraternity house. Yeah, I know, it's great, huh? Friendly. I want to furnish it andmake it pretty and bright. We're grown up now. You work for a big corporation,I'm the wife of a big wheel. You want our children to bring their friends home and have them laugh at the place? Foul. Bringing kids into an argumentis beneath you, Patricia. You're not ashamed to bringyour friends home from school, are you, Robbie? What friends? So how's school, anyway? Flunked his first math quiz. Robbie, you failed a math test? So I had an off day. Hi, Jimmy. Come on in. Hi. Thank you. Is your mom with you? No, she's at the club. Going to be main members tomorrow. My dad and mom are over theresigning papers, or something. Oh, that's terrific. Hi. Hi. Hi. This is Billie Ferris. Your dad works for his dad. I was telling him about yourcomputers and everything. You get Astro bomber? Yeah, of course. I got $20 says you lose. I don't bet money anymore. But I'll bet you this houseyou're full of hot air. Come on. That's my boy. This furniture sure is old. Let's go look at some new furniture. Oh, Matt! I love you. Yeah, I know. Your mothershiphas been blasted to hyperspace. Hey, what are you doing? No on beats me! No one! What are you looking at? Nothing. Wanna go get a cookie? Sure. Let's go get a cookie. I've heard noisier rocksthan you two recently. The reason why we aren't talking is because Billy Ferris-- Billy Ferris what, honey? Oh, nothing, Mom. Look out! - Dammit! - You OK, kids? Yeah, Mom. Everybody all right? You guys are all right, huh? Yeah, OK. What are you, some kind of maniac? We could have been killed! I got two small children in there. I am terribly sorry. I was in such a hurry. This was all my fault. Really. Yeah, you're right. It was your fault. I'd like thename of your insurance company. I would like toaccommodate you, Matthew. But I am in a hurry. Chrissy and Robbie are OK, aren't they? And Patricia? Yeah, they're all right, but-- Tom Peterson told me all aboutyou and your lovely family. Perhaps you'll pay me a visit soon at the club? I don't even know who you are. Jessica Jones. I'm the club's director. That's real nice, Miss Jones. I'd still like to have thename of your insurance company. I don't think that willbe necessary Mr. Winslow. Sir, Miss Jones is in a hurry. Yes. And again, I'm sorry for any inconvenience. Inconvenience? What about my car? I know it doesn't look like much to you, but it's the only car I got. I gotta have the whole front end relined. Everything will be taken careof to your satisfaction, sir. Now, why don't you get backto the wife and children? I've been driving 20 years, I've never seen an accident handled like this. Matthew, Matthew. If you don't mind my calling you that? Look, I do mind, all right? Here we're a small, tight knit, we like to think friendly, community. And because of it, we dothings a little differently. I'm sure you get mydrift, don't you, Matthew? Yeah, I do. I don't like your drift. - Come on, Matt. Let's go. It's history, OK? Howdy Kids. Have a nice day, Mrs. Winslow. Drive carefully, Matthew. You are now acceptedinto the inner circle. And by the symbolic entranceinto our ancient spring, you forever forsake the mundane world. And merge yourself into theprotective, exclusive shield of the club. Do you forsake all for the club? I do. Then enter into thespring and taste its power. OK, here we go. Up and running? Oh, yeah. Start with the thermal sensors. 21 degrees Celsius. 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature. All right. OK, I want you to target the match. Center of the target area. 926 Celsius. 1700 degrees Fahrenheit. Match flame temperature. Perfect. We go for the gold. Look straight ahead. No peeking. Ready? Human terrestrial. Benign-- it's amazing! It's working! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ready? Non-human, terrestrial, benign! It just reads auras, sort of. Like Capra's going to be if it can spot hostile, non-terrestrial lifeforms. How you ever gonna know? Well, I'm working on the computer to feed it synthetic datadissimilar from any form we have on Earth. Once we do that, we'll seehow the helmet reacts to it. This is Mr. Winslow, give me security. Never mind, it's a false alarm. Grace? Aren't you kind of off limits? I mean, If they found youin here, you'd be canned. If you feel you shouldturn me in, I'll understand. Just do what your conscience tells you. Grace? Employment files? I've got something I want you to read, Matt. Matt Winslow. Matt Winslow, are you back in here? Oh, hello. I'm Harry Thompson.President of the company. - Yes sir. - Matt listen. Come with me, there's somebody out here that I want you to meet.- Right. Jessica. Allow me to present Matt Winslow. This is Miss Jones of theSteaming Springs Country Club. Hello again, Matt. Hello again. You've met before? Oh, we've bumped intoeach other once or twice. Well, you're just the sortwho should join her club. I've heard great things about you. Thank you, sir. Anyway, I thought you might let Ms Jones have a peek at your lab. Sir, That's pretty classified stuff. Hell, Miss Jones is family. Show her the suit. And then would you join me in my office? Yes, sir. Right this way This is the maincomputer chest pack, which brings us back to the suit. Which will be fully automated,fire resistant, anti-corrosive. It'll also have the capabilities of-- Did you play a sport in college? What? A sport? Yeah. Rowing. This helmet-- I knew it. I could tell from theway your body is muscled. Lean, yet very strong. You should join the club, Matthew. Lots of exercise equipment,lots of pleasurable things. Plus, top people, People on their way up. Like you. Well, I guess I'm just not much of a joiner. Some things can do a lotmore for you than you think. Um, I'll think about it. Right this way. You want to follow me? Where's Tom? In his office. Oh, yeah? His office is empty. It's cleaned out. In his office. Room three. The executive wing. See you in a minute. Matt, I just wanted to say-- thanks. Sure. OK, whose office is this? Is this your office? You got promoted! Tom, you got promoted! Well, aren't you excited? Yeah, I am. Just took them damn long enough. What? I'd think you'd be swingingfrom the chandeliers. Yeah, I would, I would. Look-- oh, we have those--this is recessed lighting. That's great. So how about it? Do I Have your OK? For what? To sponsor you at the club? Oh, Tom. Come on, I'm in. I can get you in. I'm very tight with Miss Jones. Yeah, you know, she seems tobe tight with a lot of people. You know, Thompson, our president actually, had me showing her oursupposedly top secret suit. Whoops. You see what I mean? You join the club, you start rubbing shoulders with top, top people. Yeah. Tom, I appreciate what you're trying to do. I'm just not sure it's right for me. That's all. It'd be great for the kids, it would be a terrific social outlet for Patricia. And It would be fantastic for you! Look, before you can reallyget ahead around here, you've got to learn to play the game. Step over a few bodies, rubshoulders with the people at that club. Those are the facts of life. Maybe your life. Not my life. Look, Tom, I appreciate your advice and what you're trying to do. I got to get back to programming the suit. Listen to me, Matt. This is great buddy. I mean I can't believe this. This is great. Congratulations again. Matt. Nice suit. Hi! Hi, how're you doing? That sounded pretty. Why, thank you. Yeah, we got the piano tuned. Oh. Well, you sure you don't mind about this? Oh, I don't mind at all. Hey, cutie pie. You ready for the slumber party? Yeah. Great. Hey, kids! Janie, Jimmy, and Billy are here! - We're upstairs! - Oh, Go ahead. Go ahead. Thanks a lot, I really appreciate This. Oh, you're welcome. It's fine. Mary! Is that a new car? A beauty, isn't it? Tom bought it. Just a little something to run around in. Just A little something? You kidding? This is no little something. Wow. Well-- oh, I've got to get going. Oh, I wish you were a member. You know, club parties can be so much fun. Everyone who is anyone will be there. Oh, you know what I mean. I just wish Matt weren't being so stubborn. Bye. Last 10 years haven't been easy on us, Matt. And I want a piece of the pie. And if the club can help us have that, I don't see where there's any crime. I don't think it's outof line to want something that we deserve, Matt. Patricia, now who's not listening? I'm trying to tell you how I feel. Everyone at work is climbingall over each other, no matter what the cost. That damn club, that's allanybody ever talks about. It's a little scary Pat. I'm a little scared. And it's not just in my head. Maybe you are afraid. Afraid of success. Matt! Billy? You shouldn't be watching that stuff. It'll give you night-- You shouldn't do that. Go to bed. I said, go to bed. I mean it. Gotcha! Made you jump, Mr. Winslow? All right, all of you, go on. Go to bed, right now. I mean it. Morning, Grace. Do you have the new readouts? Good morning, Mr. Winslow. I'm Tracy Winters. Where's Mrs. Henderson? Oh, Mr. Thompson himself let her go. I've arranged for your staffmeeting at 11 o'clock sharp. And the new data on yoursuit will be on your desk no later than three. Yeah, but what happened to Mrs. Henderson? Well, I haven't the slightest idea. But I can tell you that whenMr. Thompson does something, he does it for a very good reason. And it stays done. I understand how you feel, Winslow. But Mrs. Henderson was just not company timber. Timber? What are we talking abouthere, people or trees? More importantly, her loyalty was at issue. Here at Micro-Digitech, wedemand absolute loyalty. Loyalty? She was the best secretary I've ever had! And once a decision is made, we expect our employees to putaside personal feelings, and pull together. It would be a shame tojeopardize all the fine work you've been doing for us here. All right, that does it. We don't need to get all worked up. I'm sure that we can reach a compromise. Look, if you feel the sameway about it in two weeks, you'll have Mrs. Henderson back. How is that? A deal? All right. Two weeks. - Good. Good. Now that we've got that out of the way-- Tom Peterson tells me that you are becoming a member of Steaming Springs. I am? Fantastic. Just fantastic. I look forward to your becoming one of us. The club is a special place. Very special. Keep up the good work. Oh, You've got a world class golf course, landscaped gardens, theriding trails back in there-- lighted tennis courts, of course. And a stupendous view almostanywhere you turn your eyes. Really, Tom? Oh, if this isn't Patricia. You know, even though I'mvice president in charge of marketing, I don't knowwhat it is about you two that brings the salesman out in me. I-- come on, what do you say? I don't see a basketball court. Would you, please? What's in there Tom? Over here? Perhaps I can help you with that? Oh, uh. Matt, I think you know Miss Jones. Patricia Winslow, this is Jessica Jones. Matt, nice to see you again. Hello, Patricia. How do you do? Well, I must say, I just love your dress. The color is so becoming to you. Well, thank you, Miss Jones. But if we're going to be friends, and I sincerely hope we will be. You have to start callingme Jessica, immediately. Come on, I'll show you around personally. She doesn't let anybodycall her by her first name. You're as good as in. Go, go. Hi. This is my favorite room. All our members are encouraged to work out, stay trim, attractive. But you already know how important that is, don't you, Patricia? Elizabeth, hi. You're doing great. Frank Stepson. President of CD Computer Corp. Meet Matt Winslow, Micro-Digitech. Hi. Hey. Soon as you climb aboard here, I'd like to talk to you about thatspace suit you've working on. Heard some good things about you. We are a tight knit family here. News of a prospective new member travels fast. To the highest levels. And once you go through our trial period where we get to know you,and you get to know us, then the initiation is a simple matter. How long will that take, Jessica? Four weeks. Maybe even three, dependingon how quickly you can fit in. Sure there'll be no problem. Really nice of you to say. Wouldn't that be exciting, Matt? Uh, yeah. Yeah. However, if Robbie and Chrissy wish to attend our annual Halloweenball with all their friends, you will, of course, have to already be full fledged members. Ah, now I know I know why allthe kids in the neighborhood have been trying to scarethe pants off of me. If you will follow me, I'll take you back up to the formal area of our club. Ow! Ah! I seem to have lost you, Matthew. I thought I heard someone crying. For help. It was probably someone crying out in ecstasy. Pleasure can make youfeel that good, you know? Oh, no. No, it was more like-- You don't care that much about money. I can tell. But you care about power. And you care about pleasure, don't you? Yes. I dunno. Would you trust me? Matthew, I like you. And I will personally see toit that your membership here is as pleasurable as possible. I'd better get back to Patricia. Matt? Where've you been? I'll tell you later.Let's just get out of here. Oh, but wait. Jessica has just invited usfor lunch, and I wanna go. I said come on! Well, I'm certainly not the child here. OK, you wanna have lunch with Jessica? Go right ahead. I'll just do that. Maybe you ought to join up, Patricia? Join the in crowd! Matt, please come with me. No. You come with me! Was Janey there? Yeah, honey. Janey and Jimmy were therewith the rest the kids. They were helping decoratefor that Halloween thing they're having. Did the pool have a diving board? Mhm. Oh, it's you, sweetheart. Oh, Matt. I love you so much. Steady hand from the cold? Yeah. Don't wander away too far, kids. We're going to leave soon. We won't! Don't worry. What is it, Patricia? You seem troubled. Well, it's just that it's so lovely here. I really like it so much. I just wish that Matt felt the same way. What is it about this placethat frightens some people? It frightens Matt into thinkingwe're something to be resisted. It frightens you intothinking that we're so formal, we can't bend the rules alittle for someone who so clearly belongs in this club. Miss Jones-- Jessica. Jessica, I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm simply saying that if you want to join, and the children want to join, there's no reason the club has tobe religious about its rule that families join as a unit. You mean it'd be OK if thekids and I joined without Matt? Why in the world not? Why should the kids miss the Halloween ball? Why should you miss thecompany of people you prefer? Of course, if you'd like to think it over. When can we do it? Patricia, Robbie, Chrissy. You are now accepted into the inner circle. And by this symbolic entranceinto our ancient spring, you forever forsake the mundane world. And merge yourselves into theprotective, exclusive shield of the club. Do you forsake all for the club? I do. I do Then enter into the spring. And taste its power. No, I'm afraid! Chrissy? It will be all right. Go ahead. Wait. You're hurting me. You're hurting. Quiet, beds made, I wassure I was in the wrong house. I only have time for a cup of tea. Don't you look nice? Thank you, darling. Thought you deserved a littleextra rest this morning That's considerate. Uh, what's really going on here? You ding the car while I was sleeping? Something happened at the club. Hm? One of those snobs say something? The club was just great, dad. We liked it a lot. We wish you'd-- --join. Hey, Robbie, let Albert in, huh? Oh, honey, I think Albert'sperfectly happy outside. Here, Albert. Come on, come on. Hey. Hey, what's the matter? Get out of this house, you stupid dog! Just stay out there! Patricia, what are you doing? He's obviously frightened by something, don't scare him anymore. I'm sorry, Matt. It's just that he wasgrowling at the children. And I thought that, you know, I would-- - I'll go check it out. - Oh, no. It's OK. You're late to work, so go ahead. I'll take him to the vet's if you want. Probably just something he at. OK? I'll take care of it. It's all right. All right. For a second there, it lookedlike he was afraid of you guys. Don't be silly. You have a lovely day, honey. I'll take care of Albert. See you later. Quitting time, genius. Buy you a beer? No, thanks. Not today, Tom. Want to get something off your chest? Aw, just family stuff. We've talked family stuff before. Oh, it's no biggie. It's just that my wife and kids felt like strangers this morning. Starting to feel like we live intwo separate worlds these days. I know what it is. I know you don't want to hear this, but your wife and kidswant you to join the club. No, you don't know. I mean they've changed, Tom. Even the family dog has changed. Sounding crazy? Bananas. Look, it hasn't changed me at all, has it? Still the same guy. Only thing is I've got a promotion and a higher gasoline bill. Think about it. Miss Winters? Hello? Hello, Matt Winslow? You remember Mrs. Henderson, don't you? Who? Oh, Grace. Yeah. Well this is Walt, her husband. I run an animal clinic and kennels. She mentioned her husbandwas a veterinarian, right? There's something I'vegot to talk to you about. Hope that I'm not out of linecalling you at the office. No, no, you're not out of line. As a matter of fact, Iwas meaning to call Grace. I'm sorry, sir. I just stepped away from my desk for a minute, would you like me to take that call for you? No, no, it's it's all right. It's uh, family. You can go on home, Miss Winters. All right. Goodnight. Uh, What's your address? Henderson. This is nice. Feels good after where I work. Can you tell me again what happened? Well, your wife broughtthe dog here this morning. Said she got our name froma card Grace had given you. Oh, yeah. I remember. The card was on the fridge. Well, she brought theanimal in and said that it had attacked her children. And that that was the final straw. Final straw? She said the dog was vicious from day one, probably some kind of brain tumor. Couldn't be trusted with people anymore. What? Said I should put him out of her misery. Is the way she put it. Doesn't sound like Pat. She loved that dog. Did you do it? She wanted to watch. I told her I didn't operate that way. Then she said she'd have totake the dog somewhere else. She kept saying how dangerous he was, and how he had to be killed. So I told her that I would do itafter she was out of the drive. Told her there wasn'tanother vet for 50 miles. In short, I lied through my teeth. I don't do that. But I did. Hey, Albert. Come here, boy. Come on. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, boy. Now you tell me-- is that a vicious dog from day one? Hi, darling. I didn't hear you come in. What's wrong? Patricia, the colors. I thought you wanted something more cheerful? Oh, that. Well, I spoke to Jessicaand she said that the mood is what's in this year. Oh, did you have a rough day, darling? Patricia-- where's the dog? You mean Albert? Albert's at the vet's. I talked to the vet, Patricia. He's my ex-secretary's husband, remember? He told me what you said. He told me what you did. All those lies. I try and give youeverything you want, Matt. I try to be a perfect wife, a perfect mother, a perfect lover. Everything you want and need. Now, do I ask very much in return? All I do is ask you to spend more time with the children and me. I mean, choose us over a dog that may be rabid, or even worse? I don't know. Matt-- just give us alittle bit more of yourself. Just enough to keep us together. Join us, Matt. Join us before we become a family of strangers. OK, Patricia. It's all right. It's going to be all right. Patricia? Ah! You scared me half to death. You all right? Yes, of course I'm all right. What is it with you? Of course I'm all right, my darling. I'm just teasing you. Don't you know that? Um-- Pat-- I'm just playing with you, Matt. What's gotten into you? Ow. I just want to make love to you, my darling. Ow! Take it. Easy. Come on. Honey? I'm just making love to you, darling. That's all. Just making love to you. Patricia? Are you all right? Patricia, did you join without me? Hello? Walt, it's me, Matt Winslow. Listen, has Grace gotten back yet? She's dead, Matt. Highway patrol says she must have fallen asleep. I don't know. She went off the road-- into a tree. My god. Well, I-- I'm so sorry. The car burned, Matt. There wasn't anything left. Matthew? I forgot the new, uh-- furniture was coming today. Can't believe how differentit makes the place feel. Wait a minute. Is this a new piano, too? We didn't buy a piano, did we? Isn't it a wonderful instrument? Matt, did you hear how I sounded? Yeah. It's-- a littledifferent from the gentle Patricia I used to know Gentle Patricia, huh? Where did that get me? Where has that gotten any us? This? What I want, Matthew, is some power. We can have it if we join the club. We can have the power tohave the things that we want. I guess-- I guess I just gota little out of control, Matt. I-- I wanted to make a point, you know? Where did this piano come from? Oh, well, you're not going to believe this, but to make up for that nearmiss we had the other day, she gave it to us. She gave it to me. Miss Jones? Jessica. She's so incredible. Yeah, incredible. I've got something I want you to read, Matt. Matt Winslow. I look forward to your becoming one of us.

Just keep it moving, MissJones wants us in on time. Don't worry. Would you mind telling me what you're doing up there talking, whenyou're supposed to be working? You've been up here 20 minutes,and it's still not done! What, is it such a big deal? If this baby works-- 800 degrees? No human can stand that. Bad bunny! Bad bunny! Bad, bad, bad! You've been a very bad bunny! I have to punish you! Bad bunny, bad! Bad bunny, bad! Bad. Bad. Bad. Chrissy? Welcome home, Dad. It's nice to be home, Chrissy. No it isn't. No, it isn't! We don't like nice! We don't like nice! We do not like nice. We do not like nice. Hey, it's OK-- Get away from me! You're not my daughter. Tell me where my daughter is. But I am your daughter. No, you're not! She's down there throughthose springs, isn't she? Good, Chrissy is. But now you've just got bad Chrissy. Bad, bad, bad Chrissy. Tell me how I can get her back. Tell me! You can't! You're burned. No, leave me alone! Put me down! Get away from me! Chrissy, Stop it! You'll hurt yourself. I hate you! I hate you! Chrissy, I'm going to get youback the only way I know how. Honey? I hate you! I hate you! Robbie, stop it! Dear God. What are you doing, Matt? Thomas, you-- I-- I was just going to run some tests on the suit. At 8:00 on a Saturday night? Well, you know what they say. An idle mind is the devil's playground. Then why do I see fear in your eyes? You're not one of us, Matt. You had your chance, and you blew it. You're a loser. Tom? We are the winners. We have to get rid of the losers. Oh! It's on my foot. Good evening, Mr. Peterson. Love the costume. How's your new car running? It's, uh, great. Just great. Just great. The party's inside? Yeah. Go right in. Go ahead. Take it. Right here. Waiting all night. Oh, there he is. Come here. Hey, hold it. Who's in there? Well, it's-- it's Tom Peterson. Are you crazy? Taking a $10 million suit out of the lab? Hey, half the spaceexecutives are here tonight. Besides, what better wayto promote the suit, huh? It's only a mock up. It's not the real thing. That's genius. That's pure sales genius. Hey, everybody, take a look at Peterson! Lawrence. That's some costume. Peterson's bound to win the prize. That's not Tom Peterson. Matthew! Help! Save us! Daddy! Help me! Matthew! Do you think you can run from me? Do you think your weapons can touch me? Daddy! Dad! Help me! That's just an illusion, Matthew. Matthew! Daddy! Help me! Don't be a fool. Dad! You'll be broken to bits if you jump. Save us! Matthew! Help me! Save us! No! Save us! Help us! Save us! Doctor! Dr. Winslow! Ove here! Over herre! Matthew! Daddy! Help me! Help us! Help! Daddy! Help me! Help us! Patricia? What do you want? Matthew, there's somethingyou must admit to yourself. Everyone who joined the club-- everyone who walked throughthat doorway at the springs did so willingly. Now you can choose power too, Matt. And free yourself. Submit. No, don't! Don't go in there! Not even your suit can shield you in there. Matthew. Matthew! Patricia? Can you hear me? Please! Hear me, Patricia! She's locked from you. Dangerous to touch. Terribly dangerous. Patricia, I'm going to get you out. I promise. I'm gonna take you back, Pat. Ah! I warned you, Matthew. You should listen to me. You'll be destroyed if youtry to break in on her now. Besides, that's just the weak Patricia. No. She's the good Patricia. That's what you've done, isn't it? You've taken all the love. All the good people who joined the club-- and put them down here. Well, I want the good Patricia back! She's hardly worth it-- when you can have me. Oh, Matthew, I was so foolish. Thinking to tempt you with money, or position. What you really want is to taste the fire. You know it's true. You're bored with anything less now. Admit it. You want me. I want my wife. I want my kids. I want my family. I can damn you, Matthew! I can curse your soul to thisplace for eternity if I want! I don't think you can. You said so yourself. All you can do is lie, and tease, and tempt. The choice is up to us. It's up to me. Patricia? Matthew! Patricia? Remember where we werewhen we loved each other? When we cared about eachother more than anything else? Patricia, I love you. Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! Ah! I love you! Dad! Daddy! I can't breathe! Don't touch him! Robbie! Don't touch him! Robbie. It's OK. Ugh! You're throwing it all away for nothing! Mommy! Daddy! Chrissy! Don't touch her! Get me out! Dear God. Oh, dear God-- Where have we been, Matt? It's OK, Pat. It's OK. We're home. We're together. I love you. Come here. Come here. Hey, what's going on? There's a big fire down at the club. We heard on the radio,it's been burning all night. Was anybody hurt? I don't know yet. There are a lot of fireengines over there, though. Let's go see! The club's been on fire all night. They can't put it out. It burns! The club burns down to the ground! Go see! All gone. Yes, honey, it's all gone. Bunny's hungry. Guess I'd better feed bunny, huh? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Matt, are you coming in? Yeah, I'll be right there.
