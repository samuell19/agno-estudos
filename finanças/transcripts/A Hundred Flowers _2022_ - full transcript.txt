Take your time. -Let's stay at home today -Yes - want me to help you - no no no sit down eat it It's like magic Sorry for doing too much not much This year's New Year's Eve dinner will save trouble. Shredded radish mixed with vinegar and kelp rolls are all ready-made. I'm starting. It would have been nice if Kaori could join us. She works every New Year's Eve. But she enjoys her work. That's good to hear. I have fewer piano students this year. Really? Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy new year. And happy birthday. Thanks. You're the only one who remembers my birthday now. Don't you receive birthday wishes early in the morning? Since my birthday falls on New Year's Day, everyone tends to forget. Let's stay at home today. It's a call from Kaori. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. I was just thinking of calling you too. Where's Mom? Sorry, she's not here at the moment. I see. Have you had your meal? not yet. Izumi? I'm almost home. Take your time, no rush. Mom should go to bed soon too. Really? Then I'll stay awake and wait for you. Alright. I'm leaving now, just wanted to let you know. Okay. Bye. She's having some trouble at work. I've to go. She always has work-related issues during the New Year. She makes more money on New Year's Eve, after all. There's nothing we can do about work matters. I'll keep in touch with you. Got it. It's about 6 centimeters, about the size of a tennis ball. - Tennis ball? - Yes. No, it should be smaller. About the size of a ping pong ball. - Ping pong ball? - Exactly. Anyway, it's just a ball. That's right. I can't think of a better way to describe it. How would you describe it? Let me think. Maybe like a kiwi Or strawberry. Yeah. Kiddo's dad. - Kiddo's dad? - Yes. Your two adorable little strawberries are growing well. Did you know this? Here. This is the heart. You see, they're jumping! Really, so cute! Right? That's great! In six months, you'll be a dad and mom. I'm telling you... You just lied, didn't you? What? You said the baby in the belly is cute, but it's just an image. No, it's really cute. Really! I just realized that I'm about to become a dad, and I'm still adjusting. It's hard to say. But we're almost in the stable period. You should tell your mom about my pregnancy. I'll call her later. You say that now, but you'll forget later. No, I will make the call. I won't forget. By the way, did I tell you about the phone call from your mom? - What did she say on the phone? - Look quickly! You can catch it. Keep going! You caught it. Well done! It's a big fish. Is it a rainbow trout? - No, it's a carp. - Huh? Is it a carp? Yes, It's a carp - What were you saying earlier? - What? You mentioned my mom's phone call. Yes, she said it was meant for you but dialed my number by mistake and laughed. So, what did she say? She said she's looking forward to the fireworks. She also said that half fireworks are beautiful. Half fireworks? What does that mean? I thought you would understand. Didn't she say anything else? No. By the way, did you hear that KOE's debut has been delayed? Another delay? Tanabe Department is still struggling with adjustments. Mr. Osawa is probably going to get angry. There's nothing we can do, it's just like conducting an experiment. You go ahead, I'll make a phone call to Mom and then join you. Now? The meeting starts at 11. I'll go up right away. I say “hello” You would know my words. I say “bonjour”. Hello. Flowers bloom, colors. KOE is a memory-based artist. The melodies, vocals, and postures are learned from over a thousand artists. In addition, to cultivate emotions, various memory data is digitized, allowing KOE to also experience them. And through deep learning in creating artificial appearances. Do you know? Actually, it's already done. Is that so? It still has a long way to go. That's not what I meant. Minister Osawa and Tanabe Department are involved with each other. Is that so? I told you, you didn't know. You're really slow in that aspect. Furthermore, the melodies and lyrics are also generated by KOE itself. Aiming for the ideal artist in human memory. Various adjustments are currently being made. So, um... Can this be sold well? I understand that KOE possesses many unique characteristics. By making constant adjustments, its personality can be emphasized. Can it sell well with adjustments? They should have this conversation in bed. When did they start? About... probably half a year ago. Wait, Kaori also knows? Why are you asking me? Don't you communicate properly as a couple? It's dangerous to run like this. Eggs. It's dangerous to run like this. Eggs. It's dangerous to run like this. Mr. Asaba. Mr. Asaba. Mr. Asaba. Mr. Asaba, wait. Mr. Asaba. Wait. Mr. Asaba. Mr. Asaba. it hurts. Let go of me. Mr. Asaba. It hurts. Let go of me. By the way. We're having a child What? Kaori is pregnant. A child? When is the due date? August. Congratulations. I'm so happy. When did you find out? I need to call Kaori and congratulate her. Can we handle it as their purchase this time? Understood. I'll retrieve the surveillance footage for you to review. Okay. Your mother is not too old. Her condition may deteriorate quickly. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. We will prescribe Aricept and Galantamine to her If it's effective, it can slow down the progression of the disease. But it can only maintain for a few months to five years. The brain's nerve cells will gradually die. However, the cause of this condition is still unknown. There is a theory that it's related to a certain protein. Doctor, Miss Yuriko Kasai will be here soon. The next steps will be more challenging. please take good care of your mother. Even though she has dementia, she doesn't forget everything or know nothing. After all, she is your mother. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. I hope you still respect her and Take care of her. I don't think I'll take piano lessons anymore. Now only the little girl from the corner comes for lessons. We need to find a caregiver. I can still play the piano now. I'm sorry. Koizumi hasn't come home yet. I don't know if he is with you. Hey, Miss Nikaido. Hey, I'm talking to you. Let him eat whenever he wants. He's not a child anymore. Miss Nikaido, I... gradually sinking... Wait Zeus! Since my birth, I have been an upright man. Let me die as an upright man. Pushing and shoving pedestrians aside, Meles left like a black whirlwind. He passed through the feast held on the Prairie, And the people attending the feast were astonished. He braved all obstacles, crossed mountains and hills, Running ten times faster than the setting sun. In a moment of passing by a group of travelers, He accidentally overheard ominous conversation. By now, that man must have been tied to the gallows, right? ah that man... I'm rushing around like this for that man's sake. I cannot let that man die. Faster, Meles! You must not be late. Miss Nikaido... I'm sorry. It started raining, so I went to the yard to collect the clothes. When I came to my senses, she was already gone. Did you go to the police? I just went to the police station. They're sending people to look for her now. Mr. Izumi, do you know where she might have gone? Anyway, I'll go nearby and look for her first Okay. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Hello... Hello.. This way, please. Izumi... where did you go? I've been looking for you. mom. But it's great. I finally found you. Mom was so worried about you. Aunt Yuriko, it's really great. Yes, thanks to all of you. thank you. My son, he got lost again. It's already late at night, It's rain again. I'm worried he's freezing somewhere. The way Izumi raises his hand is so beautiful. Even his fingertips are extended straight. The teacher can't help but praise him. He recited "Run, Melos!" in the open class. The mom standing next to me told me... It's already the season of sunflowers. Yeah, it is. - Welcome. We've always only had one sunflower. Hey, why is that? I want this one. Thank you for your patronage. Why is that? - What's wrong with you? Are you okay? Yeah, I've already started my maternity leave. The doctor also told me to move around more. - 200 yen - ok - thanks for coming. - thanks. Shall I take it? - Huh? Sure. Doesn't Mom want to leave this place? Huh? I'm thinking whether we should live with her. But we've already decided. would she want to live with you? I don't think she would. Ah, the ocean. Whenever I see the ocean, I think of that big fish. fish? It was the first time, we went fishing in elementary school. you caught a big fish. Yeah, I sat on the boat and cast the fishing rod. The fish suddenly hooked onto it. It was about 30 centimeters long. Right. We've been many times since then, but we couldn't catch a fish as big as that one. Why did we come to this lake again? We stayed at a lakeside guesthouse. Mom, that's the sea. We caught a rainbow trout and had it grilled with salt, sharing it between the two of us. It was delicious. I'll come see you on the weekend. No need. The baby is about to be born. This is Ms. Kashiwagi Yuriko, our new resident Please take care of her. Nice to meet you all. I'm Kashiwagi Yuriko.

Madam, is it okay to put this here? Yuriko, come over here. Hanshin Electric Railway. The Hanshin Electric Railway has standard tracks. The routes are extensive, but you can't see the train cars clearly from this height What a pity. We'll have to start buying from scratch. That's what makes it interesting. Did you buy the garbage bag? and shampoo? I forgot. Sorry. Mr. Asaba, you start work tomorrow, right? Yeah. Leave the house at 8 a.m. every morning. Class will be over around 5 o'clock. Can you come back at 6? Um We can have dinner together, morning and evening. I was just thinking about that. Watch closely. - Mmm. Domi-soti, domi-soti, play gently. Yuriko. Are you done with your work? Mmm, I hurriedly finished up. I'm sorry for coming suddenly. It's okay, I'm happy. What are you doing? Omurice (omelette rice). - Is it okay to use tomato sauce and rice inside? - Sure. Can you still play? Yes, because it's the song you taught me.

Hmm, several years ago. Do you have any kids? Don't run! They're so mischievous, really a headache. My husband is researching ship propellers at the university here. It's the university in Kobe. He might become a professor. I'm planning to leave my family here. I'll be living alone over there. Don't run, it's dangerous. Hey, come back. Chie, I should go. - Then, let's exchange contact information. - Mmm. I'm not home right now, so please leave your name and phone number. Yuriko, it's me. Sorry, I won't be able to come back for dinner. I have to stay at the school and continue working I'm sorry. The electricity meter isn't running either. Hello, do you live here? Is there something wrong? I need to confirm something. Between 12 and 2 o'clock, did you hear any strange sounds? Like someone entering or leaving, do you remember anything? No, I wasn't home. What's going on? actually, there have been burglaries in this apartment. Burglaries? By the way, where are your family members? I live with my husband, but he's on a business trip now. Seems like nothing happened then. Just in case, can I see a photo or album of your family? An album? The thief is quite strange. They didn't steal money, only albums. There were also small flags bought at tourist spots, things like that. I think it should be okay now. I see. Sorry to bother you. Take care. If you remember anything, please contact us. By the way, just in case, may I ask for your name? Yuriko Asaba. Why are you so scared? - Let's go upstairs. - Allright. Here. Happy New Year. Hey, why did you come? Here. I hesitated for a long time. In the end, I wasn't sure if it was appropriate or not. Happy birthday. You remembered. Impossible to forget. You bought goldfish, huh? I bought a pair. Just like us. I've been so lonely. The cheesecake you made last time was delicious, right? It was delicious. That one tastes just like Melody's jam, right? It's blackcurrant. - Yes, it is. - yuriko. You had two of them back then. Sorry for interrupting. - Thank you. - Sorry for the wait. It's strawberry season now. Thanks. - Enjoy. - Okay. Mmm delicious. By the way, did you go back to Yokohama at the end of the year? No, I stayed here the whole time. That's nice. I have to go back to my husband's hometown. It's quite a hassle. It's more leisurely over here. But, at the end of the year, someone broke into the apartment and stole things. That's terrifying. Are you okay? Yeah, fortunately, my place didn't suffer much damage. But the thief was strange, though. They only stole photo albums and local specialties. That's really creepy, like a thief stealing memories Exactly. What item being stolen would bother you the most? For me, it's my diary. What did you write in it? Yuriko. Actually, I... - I've started liking someone. - Huh? He's married too. But when his child is at school, we meet every day. We're getting old, but... I love him. If he leaves, I might go crazy. You can't tell anyone about this kind of thing. So, I write it in my diary. I also… If I had the chance, I would like to be in a relationship with someone. That's why I understand how you feel. but what are you going to do? Are you going to get a divorce? that's impossible, I have kids after all. Mr. Asashiba. Izumi. Izumi. Izumi. Izumi. Izumi. Izumi. which one to choose? Mom, which one will you choose? i want the rabbit. Mom, that's a camel. This one is the rabbit. I'm sorry, Miss Nikaido, for making you come all this way. Mom, she's kaori. Ah, right, Miku. You've grown up. She's Kaori, Mom. Kaori. She's my wife. Wife? That's great, Izumi. She's really beautiful. thank you for coming. Let me pour some tea for you. Mom, our child will be born this month. congratulations Izumi. Do you think the baby will look like me or Miku? Well... what about the rabbit? At that time, why did you abandon me? Ms. Yuriko. It's a beautiful day today. Let's go to the garden. - Ms. Yuriko. - Okay. Come. - The ocean is so beautifu - Yeah. Huh Oh, you're pregnant. Yes, I am. I'm due this month. Izumi. Will he never forgive me? It must have been so hard for him at that time. I'm sure, he must have hated me. No, he won't. But I... I don't regret it. It's so nice to spend the night here. I will come again. Ms. Yuriko, you're in good health. Would you like to go out next time? That sounds good. Any place you want to go? - Fireworks. - Fireworks? Watching a fireworks show is nice, huh? I want to see half of the fireworks. half? Mom, let's check first. then goodbye. Next time, I'll come to see you again. I'm sorry. I love you. wow, 27 unread messages. This isn't the workload someone on maternity leave should have. Although that's true, I can still reply to messages. - Mom looks energetic, huh? - Yeah. But soon she won't recognize me anymore. When I was pregnant, I wasn't really happy, to be honest. Really? I worried if I could continue working and couldn't drink alcohol anymore. I kept thinking about these things. I see. My mom hasn't been home for about a year. I was still in elementary school back then. Seems like she was with another man. I see. Hey, did you know about it before? No, but I could feel that something was going on. I see. It feels like your relationship with your mom is a bit strange. Strange? I really don't know if I can be a good dad like this. After all, I haven't seen my dad since I was born. and my mom didn't take care of me. I had to live on my own. Even if we become parents, it doesn't mean we won't make mistakes. Who knows, maybe one day I'll want to run away too. Your mom keeps apologizing and saying sorry to you all the time. How long are you going to let her apologize? Anyway, she'll forget soon. Look, half of the fireworks. - There really are some. - Yeah. Thank you, that's really nice. let's go over there. - Shaved ice. - Huh? I want to eat strawberry shaved ice. Let's eat it after watching the fireworks Izumi. Thank you, for bringing me to see the fireworks. It's so beautiful. It's really nice. This is half of the fireworks. such beautiful fireworks. Maybe one day I'll forget. Mom. Mom. Hey, where is she? Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Sorry, let me pass. Mom. Mom hasn't returned home. Mom. Mom. Mom. Where did you go? Why do you always get lost? It's you who got lost. i know. You wanted me to find you, so you intentionally got lost, right? I want to see half of the fireworks. Eh? I want to see half of the fireworks. Mom, you just saw them. No, I want to see half of the fireworks with you. Please, can you just... want to see it, I want to see it. I just want to see half of the fireworks. - Mom. Xiao Hui always gets to eat strawberries first. I've always been envious of her. And then a thief came and stole the photo album and the little flag. My memories were stolen. Alright, alright. I understand. Just calm down for a moment. you. Who are you? Huh? Mom. It's me. you. who are you? Mom. Mom, it's me. Mom. Mom. Let go. Let go of me. - Mom. - Let go of me. - let me go. - mom. Don't touch me. Why can't you stop like this? Who are you? How could you forget everything? But I remember everything. The fireworks we just saw. Being abandoned when I was little. You say you can forget, but what about me? I'm sorry. I, want to see, half of fireworks. But about the press conference, I'm really uncertain. Mr. Izumi, you're the one in charge. The one in charge is Nagai. You've worked hard. - You've put in a lot of effort for the Tanabe Department. - Hey. Thank you. Let's stop here for today. Let's end it for now. You've worked hard. You've really worked hard. Thank you so much. No, I really don't understand what it all means. How should I handle this? Stuffing a bunch of memories haphazardly. In the end, nobody is the same anymore. If only KOE had a function to forget. That would make us more like humans, Hmm. By the way, how is your mom's health? There's said there's a concert at the nursing home in a couple of days. She's practicing the piano now. Your mom can still play the piano? She doesn't recognize me anymore. She forgot, but I remember everything. Is that so? We didn't remember much either, did we? Hinata woke up. Let's finish it soon. Yeah, just a little more. - I've cleaned everything already. - Thank you. Hinata, come to daddy? Going to find daddy? - Such a good girl. - Good baby. Let's donate the usable things to the nursing home and throw away the rest. In the end, we've forgotten everything, huh? sorry. sorry. Don't cry, don't cry. You're becoming more understanding. We'll go back now. Yeah, I'll contact you when I'm done. Mom. I'll visit you at the Microwa Nursing Home later. Hinata, say bye to grandma. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. - then here we go. - be careful on the road. It's so beautiful. These are the most beautiful fireworks I've ever seen. Really? Hmm Such beautiful fireworks, and someday we might not remember them anymore. No, that won't happen. These fireworks are only half. Yeah. Mom. I don't remember anymore. Mom, did you see it? It's half of the fireworks. Hey. Did you see it? Mom. I'm sorry. - Let's see who runs faster. - Wait for me. Ah, it's a lion. - It's a lion. Rabbit. Koizumi, catch it. - Amazing. - Right? - Huh? - It's for you.
