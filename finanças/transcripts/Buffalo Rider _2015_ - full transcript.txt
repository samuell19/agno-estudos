She would have been 34 today. You remember Grandma Somjai in Thailand? She really wants to see you. I said, she really wants- I said, she really wants- Anyway, just so you know, I made arrangements. You're gonna go spend the summer in Banglamung. All right then… Tell you what. Here's how you get your way. You don't wanna go? Just talk to me. Tell me you don't wanna go. God gave you a voice. Use it. You're so much like your mother was when she was a girl. So beautiful, with your mother's big eyes and silky skin. And just like her, quite a little bitch. Oh, wait! Hey, wait! Hello! Stop! Hey Boonrod. You know this is my grandfather's property… …and those are his fish. Hey Boonrod, where you going? Look who is here! Greetings! Come on in! This is my granddaughter Jenny. Isn't she cute? Good morning, Mr. Nun. This is my granddaughter. Coming through! No brakes! Good morning, Grandma Sai. In your seats. Now. Today I have the pleasure of introducing our new student from Los Angeles, California. Her Thai name is Janthanee but you can call her Jenny. Take a seat here. Boonrod. You're late again. Come to the front. Give him the cane! He likes it! You will step outside and stand with a ruler in your mouth for 15 minutes. When you're done, you'll come back and write the exact time our class begins, one hundred times. Understood? Go on. All right then. Open up your books and go to today's lesson. (CHILDREN READING FROM LESSON BOOK) Hey! They say you don't talk. It's OK. I like girls that don't talk. Hey Boonlua, where's your son? In school. Why? No reason. We need to do something about that. Hey beautiful, my beautiful girl. How about a little refill? Your tab is full. Come on, you know me. That's the problem. Tomorrow. Promise. Is that how you run my business? He'll get the money, Mr. Chun. Oh, I have no doubt of that. He'll steal it from his wife. Like he always does. Alright. This is it. Take picture. OK, You guys bunch in together. Don't be shy. You, monk, would it kill you to smile? (MUMBLING) What? I don't think monks are even supposed to touch women. Really? Listen, it's no problem, men want to touch women. Shut it! You know if you need decency, you'd be in that thing. Because this is the Christmas Card! How many chances do we get-we have come a long way to do this, and you're gonna screw it up! Check this out… Derek… What… Here, I'd like you to meet my grandson, Archit. He practically runs his school. If I don't watch out, he'll be running me soon. Grandma Somjai. Oh, hello! Have you met my granddaughter, Jenny yet? No, I haven't. Go on, say hello. Nice to meet you. She's very shy. I can see that. OK, let's go. (PRAYER RECITED BY MONK) We will pray that you meet your mother again in the next life. - He must be in school… - But he is not! I can't watch him all the time, I have to take care of the house! This is all your fault. I can't watch him every second of the day. Get back here! Complain, complain! He is your son! Hey, Boonrod! Why weren't you in school? Answer your father. I'll tell you why. You were fishing on Phooyai Chun's property. Admit it! Those are his fish! My son's a common thief now? Answer me! Where else can he fish? Phooyai Chun owns all the best fishing spots. You stay out of this! Boonrod wouldn't need to steal if his father had a job. And I wouldn't have to beg for food at the temple in front of our friends. We are not thieves! And we are not beggars! We are not beggars! What are we then? …out came the sun And dried up all the rain, So the itsy-bitsy spider Climbed up the spout again! Baa baa black sheep, Have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir Three bags full. One for my master, And one for my lady, And one for the little girl Who lives down the lane. Mommy!!!! What do you need? I don't understand. Score! Here! Give it to me! Yess! Come on, come on! Ouch!!!! Perhaps Jenny would like to show the class where she lives in California. Boonrod. Come here. Come here right now. Hurry up. What am I supposed to do with you? What's that? I didn't hear you? I want you to look at the time. Now hold it up and show the class. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. What time does it say? We all know you can talk. Talk, Boonrod! What is the time? See what you've done, Boonrod? You've brought shame upon this family. You want to live like an animal? Is that what you want? I'm gonna teach you what it means to be an adult! Are you ever going to become a normal person, Boonrod? Here, this will teach you! It is delicious. - Take some more. - Thank you… HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JENNY Listen, I - I didn't know her name… I didn't know where she was going. I mean a young girl out like that… that time a night, traveling alone is very dangerous. I got a niece about the same age… and anything could happen. That's why I brought her here for you to figure this thing out. - Thank you mister Barrow. - Thank you, and I mean it too… I just wish you would… try to communicate to her that I did not mean to frighten her. Anyway… Thank you very much. Hey, there he is. Listen, I was just wondering if you know where I might be able to score a cheeseburger around here. Maybe not. Dear girl… Dear girl… I need you to affirm that she is back in your custody. We were worried about you. She had this in her possession. What is this? Let's go. Your mother. By the time she got pregnant, the doctor said she was too sick to carry a baby. I ordered her not to go through with it but she was so stubborn. Just like you. The doctor was right. The strain was too much. Over the years, she just got weaker and weaker. She was alone with her baby. No husband. Too sick to work. By the time she met your stepfather, they both knew she was dying. Still, he insisted on marrying Jenjit. So that you would be loved when she was gone. If only you could understand that this was meant to be… …your mother would be at peace. When she got home, she was severely punished for her disrespect to Teacher Ratree. That's all you get. (TEACHER DICTATES IN THAI LANGUAGE) Missed you in school today, Boonrod. I guess you'd rather be stealing fish from my grandpa's pond. Come on! Down you go! - Not so brave now, are you? - Are you, eh? Come on, get up, dirty head… Why aren't you fighting, eh? Come on, fight! C'mon, Boonrod. Get up. Look at me. You need a little lesson in respect. I said look at me. Do we have to beat it into you, Boonrod? Just like your stupid-ass buffalo… Hi Jenny! What did you draw today? Anything? Wow… like manga. Look at this! Look… ahhh… Manga! Manga! Ahhhh… Want it? Here, here! Give it to me! Hahahaha! Hahaha… Look at this girl! Ah… ouch! You crazy bitch! Hey, stop her, now! Hey Khiew, how bad do I look? You hardly notice. Take care now, see you tomorrow! Well, that was exciting… Hey, what happened to your face? Don't worry about it… …please accept our offering, for helping our girl find the right path. You have no need to worry, Somjai. Your granddaughter is fine. She is in the company of a kindly spirit that will protect her from all harm. Hey, she is back! Our girl has come back! Are you all right? Thank heaven she is all right! There. Now you are as clean as nature intended a girl to be… Now, who can tell me what this means? This will be part of the… Janthanee, you're late. I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother is feeling unwell. Please give her my best. Take a seat. (TEACHER CONTINUES LECTURE) (INDISTINCT THAI DIALOG) OK, any questions? Hey, wait! Hey! Hello, Kamron. Hello, Boonlua. How do you like my boss's liquor? I haven't forgotten. I can see that. I'll have the money soon. Very soon. I promise. How much does he owe this time? Thirty thousand baht. What? Thirty thousand? I don't understand. How could it be thirty thousand? That makes no sense. Interest on your account. What? The interest is fifteen thousand? Are you crazy, Kamron? Shut up. If you don't pay up this month, it will double. Got it? And it doubles every month after that. There's just no way I can come up with that kind of cash. That's why you're going to settle up now. What do you think? Whatever you think, brother. Huh? Hmm? Can we talk about a… …repayment plan? Don't hurt him… much. Not the face. OK? Wanna stay pretty for the ladies? (POPULAR THAI LANGUAGE SONG) Come on! Pull! Pull! Hi Jenny, hello Boonrod. A buffalo race. That's me. You should come. Tomorrow. Listen, Boonrod… If I were you, I'd go home and say goodbye to your buffalo. Boonrod! Boonrod, I can't let you do that. I had to give up everything to Phooyai Chun. Even the buffalo. Boonrod! Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop it! I hate to do this. Just for tonight. Until they pick up Samlee. Hey! What are you doing here? Hey! You can't be here! Hey! Stop! Come back here! Listen to me! No one is allowed here without permission. Hey! I'm gonna kill you when I catch you! Come back here, you hear! Take her home. Yes, Boss, but what about punishment? Hmmm… Good point, Kamron. Try to think of a proper punishment for a bodyguard who can't even protect me from a little girl. Let me know what you come up with. By tomorrow. Do you know that you have put me in a very unhappy position? Huh? You… …and your foolish friend, Boonrod. A son is supposed to love his father. To trust him! Boonrod. When did I lose that trust? Huh? When did I lose that trust? It's here. Go. Go. The buffalo was stolen, while I was sleeping. What could I do? Boonlua, where's Boonrod? With Samlee. Where's Samlee? With Boonrod. Dowruang, did you hear? Jenny had run away with Boonrod! What? We have to tell Grandma Somjai! Grandma Somjai, Boonrod ran away with your granddaughter. They took the buffalo. They ran away with the buffalo. The new owner came this morning. Don't worry, Jenny will do the right thing. How can you be so sure? Because she thinks like me. What?
