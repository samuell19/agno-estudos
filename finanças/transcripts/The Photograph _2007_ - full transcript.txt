When we think of our past, there are moments that have changed us, ourselves, and our lives, and enabled us to be able to step further forward. This is a story of a man who has touched this life. Touched me. ASSISTANT PHOTOGRAPHER NEEDED FAST I will start dying today. Sita, I'm sorry. Even I have to sleep standing up with more family coming in. I feel bad for you. It's okay. Don't worry. You have always helped me. You poor thing. - Sir? - Yes. Sis. Do you still have some money? TAN, THE PHOTOGRAPHER Sorry, sir. I didn't see you there. It's a mess here. Your last tenant left loads of rubbish behind. Mr. Johan, what's wrong? It's me. Sita. You must have forgotten. I asked you last week if your room upstairs was empty. And you said yes. Just for one month. I said it was empty. But I didn't say it was for rent. You can't do that. You promised. I don't have anywhere else to go. How come you've forgotten? I even asked you how much it cost. I didn't say that room was for rent. You can't do that. Look. Here's the rent. At least half of it. I have been taking my photos with you. Why don't you believe me? By the way, you can't just act like that. I think there is a law against that. Here. Here you go. I promise. I'll give you the rest by next week. Please. I really don't have anywhere else to go. Please. - Hi, miss. - Where is this month's installment? Where was last month's? If you can't pay up, just return the dress. Girls, hide your phones and food. Don't you dare touch my phone! It's just a lousy cell phone. Relax. I'll pay my debt to you. But I can't return the dress. It's all torn up by a customer but I forget who. Damn you! Where were you last night? I was searching all over for you. You should've returned here. Where's my share? I wasn't feeling very well. I went straight home. Come here! Don't you lie to me, Sita. I went to Rosi's place, and guess what she said? You don't live there anymore. Where do you live now? Don't go anywhere. We made a deal. You have a lot of debt. If you continue with this, the interest will go even higher. Remember. Your family owes me. You know what will happen if you try to cheat me. PRESS THE NUMBER Hello, Mr. Rohim? This is Sita. - Sita? - Right. - Are you all right? - Yes, I am. Has my grandma arrived yet? Did you receive the sarong I sent you? - I did. Thank you. - Okay. - Did you like it? - I liked it. Good, then. No. It was not expensive at all. I bought it from the factory. Workers get huge discounts. That's right. Has my grandma arrived yet? - She's here. - Where is she? Can I speak to my grandma? Thank you, sir. - Grandma? - Hello? Grandma. - What is it? - How are you? What did the doctor say? I see. Yes. - Have you sent it? - Yes. I sent the money a few days ago. - What about the drawbacks? - What? - It's still not enough? - That's right. All right. I'll send the rest in a few days. - Is Yani there, Grandma? - Yes. Yan, come here. - Yani? - Mom. Yani. Honey. This is Mom. You sound sleepy. I know, honey. It's getting late. I know it's late, honey. But you do know this is the only time I can call you at a cheap rate, right? If you and Grandma want to come here, we have to save up. Okay, my love? Okay, honey? Now, go to sleep. My money has also run out. - You go to sleep, okay? - Okay. Here. Over here. Smile. One, two. - Three. - Two. I have to send this photo to your father in Saudi Arabia. It drives me crazy. Sit here and take a picture alone. Sir, I want to ask. Why do you take more pictures than necessary? You never take just one or two shots. The photographer back in my village never takes more than two shots. Isn't it a waste of money? The timing has to be right. Put your hand on your chest. To your chest. Look to the right. To the right. Sir, I saw this pose in a magazine. My daughter will like this. She'll be copying me. Well, just photograph me like this. Like this. One, two, three. Sir, I need this photo to be reproduced and enlarged. It's the only photo I have of Yani. My daughter. She probably looks different now. It's been a long time since I saw her. It's her fifth birthday next week. Don't touch my camera! Sita, come on in. - Hi, sister. - Hey. - What's that? - Here. It's the uniform I borrowed. It's about time. The owner will be coming at any time. It's really fortunate. Tini. Gosh. If you want to wear a kebaya, don't eat for a week, Tin. Just drink water. Please, don't say that, Sita. - Knock it off, will you? - I'm just kidding. Enough. She is totally stressed out. In a week, her future in-laws are arriving. They want to see if she is suitable as a prospective daughter-in-law. Stop it. Don't disturb her. What happens if they don't like what they see? Your marriage can be canceled, Tin. Sita, don't say that. Go inside, Tini. You stress her out. So, what is it like, living in the unique photographer's house? Every time he goes out and comes in, he never says a word. What? He never looks you in the eye when you talk to him. That's strange. Then, does that bastard Suroso know where you live now? He tried to follow me once, but I managed to disappear. I'll try not to lead him anywhere near here. - Right. - Don't worry. Okay. I wouldn't mind if he came looking for you. Just as long as he's prepared to be beaten to death by my brothers here. - He'll die if he dares. - All right. I'm leaving. - Now? - See you. - Take care. - Take care. Mr. Johan. TAN, THE PHOTOGRAPHER Sir. I know I promised to pay the rent by the end of the week. But I had to send money home again. My grandmother is sick again. So, my money for this month is already gone. Trust me, sir. I won't run off on you. I'll save these photos first. Sad. Confused. Angry. Happy. Good evening, you handsome men. What song would you like? Chinese Mandarin. Japanese? Korean? Beatles? "My Way"? Or... A dangdut or a sad song? You look like you have a broken heart. I'll sing you a sad song, okay? If I sing it, everybody will be happy. Hey, sing it right! Hello? Yani, it's Mom. Mom, it's late. - Yes. I know, honey. - It's not the day for a call. It's not the usual day, and I know it's already late. What is it, Mom? But I really miss you, Yani. I miss you too. Now, Mommy's working late, honey. Yes. So that Grandma can go to the hospital. And get well as soon as possible. They are waiting. Come on. Sita, this is for your sake as well as mine. Come on. Mommy. - Mom? - Yani, be good, okay? Yes, Mom. I have to go. Go to sleep, okay? Yes, Mom. I love you, Yani. Come on. Silent. Come on. Go on. Go in. Don't! Please, don't! Please, don't! Don't! Sita! Sita! You're finished! The whole village will know what a whore the mother of Yani is. Your grandmother will die of a heart attack when she finds out what you were doing in the city. WANTED: TRAIN AND WORK AS A PHOTOGRAPHER That is my father. God! You startled me! Look, sir. I can't pay the rent. And I don't have a place to stay. I also can't get a job looking like this. Can I work for you here? For a month or so. Until I get another job. Cleaning up? Or mopping? WANT TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER? WANTED: TRAIN AND WORK AS A PHOTOGRAPHER. TRAIN AS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND SEE THE WORLD. No. Don't touch that box. It's really filthy there. You are usually very clean. I just want to clean it. Just don't touch that box anymore. Leave this part alone. Name? Sita. Occupation? Factory worker on her way to becoming a manager. This month, we are filling an order to make winter jackets. I'm Sita. I work in the button section. Mr. Johan, are you all right? Mr. Johan. TAN, THE PHOTOGRAPHER - This one, sir? - Yes. Stand there. One, two, three. Smile. Sir! Mr. Johan. He was greedy. He took everything that was left to his siblings when his parents died. Even the inheritance of his retarded brother. - Do you know how he died? - He was in so much pain. What would happen if someone died like that? He has angered his parent's spirits. They came to haunt him on his deathbed. He left his brother stranded in a mental hospital. He didn't keep his promise to his parents. The ancestral spirits are in an uproar. When he dies, he will also burn with hellfire. BLESSINGS FROM HEAVEN Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan! What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at the marketplace? Sir. Sir. Ma'am. Sir, the flyers won't last long like this. They will be gone in a day or two. Especially when it rains. Nobody will see them. Then, I will make some more until I get an apprentice. Don't you have any family to be taught? Where is your family? You just sit there. I was just going to take these. - Where is he? - Don't stand here. - Just let us be. - What is your problem? - Hey. - Wait. Sir, many people are waiting outside. So, the flyers did work. There are so many of them. There are a lot of people. That's good, right? So, what now? I can't clean up if people keep coming in. Do you want to see them one by one? I think you should eliminate some of them. I saw a man using a cane. Mr. Johan. Sir. So? So? Family. From the look of the people outside, I don't think they are related to you. You must believe me. My ancestors came from China. They are from Mainland China. We have the same surname. You are a Tan, right? I'm Martin Tan. Must be a man. What? Why only men? That's discriminative. There is no such thing nowadays. Rights, status, work, salary. It's all the same. Anyway, what's the salary like? You got to be kidding me. This is a big city. Nobody works for free. He's right, sir. Why don't they get transportation money? The person should really want the job. That will be a little bit difficult. We've been waiting for so long. Gentlemen, ladies. I'm sorry. - Only men can apply. - Thank you. I'm so sorry, ma'am. Wait. Only men are allowed to apply. Wait. I'm sorry. Only healthy young men are allowed to apply. Define healthy. How young is young? - You should have written the requirements! - Right! You shouldn't have wasted our time and energy. REQUIREMENTS: HEALTHY AND YOUNG MEN. WILLING TO WORK WITHOUT PAYMENT EXCEPT FOR MEALS THREE TIMES A DAY. Well, I'm a man. Technically, my "equipment" is still intact. But, miss. When it comes to matters of the heart, we are the same. I'm a woman inside. Do you want to check, sir? That camera looks really old. I know a collector who would pay a lot of money for that camera. Color-blind. - Are you color-blind? - Of course not. Why do you ask about color? Who is color-blind? Okay, then. What color is your shirt? It's red. Reddish. Your pants? They're brown. NOT COLOR-BLIND! Why does a soldier want to train as a photographer? Photographer? I'm here to take a picture. What? Didn't you see the announcement at the door? There's an interview going on for a photographer trainee. Did nobody tell you outside? There isn't anyone and I didn't see any announcement. Well, can I take my picture or not? One, two. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. What's wrong? This is the last time I will wear this uniform. The very last time. I was discharged from the army today. Tomorrow, as I walk out of the house, I'll be a civilian. Imagine. A civilian. I'll be just like the two of you. Why were you discharged? I don't know. They say that it's a technical matter. Would you like to train as a photographer? Smile. One, two, three. God damn it. You know, I've been looking for her everywhere. Where is she? I know you are hiding her somewhere. She owes me a lot of money. She is mine until she pays her family's debts to me. - Get it? - What did you say? You good-for-nothing pimp! You should know one thing. She probably has paid you back a few times over. You lied to her. I don't know where she is. She should've left you years ago. Now, get your ass out of here before I kill you. Or they will beat the hell out of you. Get out of here! Go! You really are the devil. - You bastard! Get out of here! - You wretch! Damn! Yes, Grandma. I know you need the operation as soon as possible. But I don't have the money now. It's okay. How is Yani? It's good if she's all right. Anyway, Grandma. Once I have the money, I'll send it to you right away. - Okay? - Okay. Take care of yourself. Well, that's it for now. I have to go. Take care. CALL SHOP Oh, Sita. Oh, dear. What really happened? You haven't told me. Nothing happened. I just fell. What do you mean nothing happened? I don't understand. Today must be busy. Crowded. I'm going crazy. And one thing. Look at my body. It's getting fat. See? I can't fit into this. It's getting tighter. You can. Here, let me help. Hold your breath. - Wait. - One, two, three. See? It fits. I told you. Sita. Have you decided what to do next? Done. The kebaya is pretty. You'd better not eat a thing. Okay? I got an offer to sing on a huge cruise ship. They say I can bring my grandma and Yani with me. Sita, it's me. "A cruise ship"? Seriously? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Seriously, I'm fine. At least for now. But I don't know what I'll do next yet. But at least I still have a roof over my head. - Rossi! - Yes, I'm coming. Whose roof? Mr. Johan's roof? He is a strange man. In the past, his wife and son were going to leave him when they got hit by a train. Since then, he's prayed and left offerings at the same spot every day. It's strange, right? - Rossi! - Yes! - Hurry up. - I have to go. I'm coming. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All these photos are out of focus. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really sorry. I failed again. I thought this time that I could prove I could live outside the military. I have been pretending all this time that it was all a mistake. That I was wrongly accused. Actually, why did they dismiss you from the army? They said... This is what they say, not me. They said there was something wrong with my eyes. I don't know why my eyes got screwed. Sometimes they can focus, sometimes they can't. During shooting practice... I shot my commander-in-chief during target practice. But it was an accident. How can this happen? How can we not have wedding photos?! What will we tell our children and grandchildren? Calm down. Don't be upset, Agus. Everything has happened. I'm sure Mr. Johan will do something about it. Right? What? Like what? Let me see that one. Beautiful. Okay. It's all good. Where is it? How much? This is for you. Of course! Here's something extra. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you have anything else? They are really pretty. Sita! Where are you? Sita! Where is Sita? Where is she? Sita! Come on down! Give me back my money. I know your real name. Sariah! Sita! Where are you going? Sita! Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan... The house is getting dirty. Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan, where are you? I am not ready to go yet. I haven't completed my tasks. Wait a moment. Wait. Calm down, sir. They're just fumigating the village. Sir. Actually, I got a singing offer next month. In the expensive nightclub around here. But it's impossible. My face is still bruised. That means I can work full-time here. At least for a few months. I will try to finish these tasks. With all my strength. I have done nothing in my life. Absolutely nothing. Let's do whatever you want to do. It's been a long time since I've taken a ride on a train. A train ride, and then the harbor to see the sea. Come on. The ships from China arrived here. I remember I nearly fell when we descended. Ever since I was young, I've wanted to travel far away. Back to China from here. Why didn't you? Many things happened. You still can. I can help you. I'm going to be a singer on a big cruise ship to China. - Then, we can go to... - Yes, I know. You told me that you were going to be a singer on a cruise ship. Yes. When it really comes up, we'll go to China, okay? Yes. I can be a photographer on a cruise ship, but can't get around on a bicycle. Why do I look sad there? You are happy in this one. Photos can reveal many lies and truths. It depends on which ones you want to hang and the ones you keep hidden. Sariah, Sita. Sita, Sariah. My name is Sariah. Not Sita. Sita was my nickname. Miss Sariah. Dangdut! Yani? Yani, dear. - Who's this? - This is Mommy. - Yes, Mommy. - You've been waiting so long, haven't you? - Yes, I have, Mommy. - Tell, Grandma. I will send the money right away. - So, Grandma can get better soon. - Yes, Mom. - Okay, dear? - Yes. I'll tell her. Come. Get in. Come on. Get in. Come on, miss. Get in. Mr. Johan. Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan, it's me. Sita. Mr. Johan. I live for the future. Not in the past like you. I have to take care of my grandmother and my daughter. I live for the living, not for the dead. It's been a while in this box. No! You must not take a picture of me. It's bad luck. What difference does it make if you, me, or someone else takes the picture? They shouldn't. Only someone who is going to be my successor can take my picture. There is nobody who wants to be. I have tried. I have tried so hard to find a successor. I am sorry. I have failed. I have failed. Forgive me. Does it really have to be fulfilled, sir? - If you can't... - You don't understand. I promised. I vowed. I'm sure they would understand, sir. After all, they're already dead. I mean, they are in heaven now. I have to fulfill all my promises before I can be with them. But that is so hard. What happens if you can't find a successor? You don't understand. A vow to the ancestors must be fulfilled. I will fulfill that promise. Otherwise, I'll never meet my family again in the afterlife. What do you want to do with all those photos? I took these photos. I was there that day. That morning, I told Selly I was going to leave them. I hated everything about my life. I hated being a successor to a family legacy. I hated being obedient. And I told Selly that I didn't love her. That I'd never loved her. I told her everything that day. Get the camera here. - Do you know what happened? - I know, sir. I shouted at them as hard as I could. I shouted at them to get off the tracks. There were trains passing by, but they kept on walking. It's the ghost that haunts this place. The ghost that places its hand over the ears of people. It happens often here. It's the third one this year. Leave. Just leave me. Never come back. I will hurt you and everybody close to me. I vowed to my ancestral spirits that I would be a good son. A good husband. A good father. But I failed. I can't even keep a simple promise. - Leave, Sita. - But... Nothing is good here. Return to your daughter. Hold her tight. That is my truth. I cannot pretend anymore. Sir. Don't come near me. The yellow one. Hey! How dare they?! Nasty brats. - Make it tight. - I got it. This is the pattern. Smooth it, and then cut it out, one centimeter apart. - How much for this one? - It's cheap. Ten thousand. Sita. Sita. Sita. Can you please take a picture of me? Look at here, sir. Smile. One, two, three. Once more. Smile. I am Yani, and this is the story of my mother. This photograph has carried my mother and me onward through life, living it the best we can. This life that was captured on the walls of memories.
