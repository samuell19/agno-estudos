Translation: Saga Raw: Midori Timing & Encoding: Key During high-school, I... I... fell in love for the very first time. JUNJOU (PURE HEART) Well done! That first love... and I... met again. You already.... What? You... already knew back then, right? Sorry for letting you wait. Yes! I am Kurata from 'VS Company'. Ah... Kurata... Shousei. You read it well, huh? In fact it is read as 'Masanari'. Aaahh! Um... I'm a freelance writer, Tozaki. Can't be. I did not expect meeting you again under these circumstances. I agree. But... I did not expect Kurata would remember me. During high-school, we have never really talked to each other. I guess you're right. You only looked at me, is it not? Huh? And often you only read books. Eh... Really? You... really liked me, right? Uh... You found out? The truth is that.... Let's say that... I was longing. It was after all my first love. And of course, back then... back then... If it was me meeting my first love, I would invite them in an instant. Are you not the same, Tozaki? That's... The one you love is not a guy, isn't it? I guess, that's true. I... am right now not with any woman. So.... How about it? Kurata... Have sex with me. I don't mind doing it with you. I'm really serious. When you saw my face, you should have known right away that it was me. And confirming it with my business-card... If you did not invite me, I would in that case just left. But... Because you still remember me... I really did not expect it. That's why I had sex with you before I left. Quite coldhearted, ain't it? But... You are only interested in women. Even knowing that, I.... See you later. Uh... Wai... What was that.... From now on... the phone has a different application and can be turned into various accessories. Gaming is becoming quite a rage nowadays. The company can't effort it though, just temporarily. That's what happened when we met again. But I have not heard from Kurata since. I was feeling naive. It's not the place where I should expecting things. Yeah... it is not. But even so.... Aahh.... senpai!? Tozaki speaking. Thank you for the hard work. It's Miyata. Ah... Thank you too for the hard work. How is going your work with the manuscripts? I'm sorry. It will take me some time to write about the dictation. I'll do it after that. You are slow, hm...? What happened to you? It's not like you. I'll send them over when I get them. Okay? We have to lay the manuscripts out the day after tomorrow. Have them checked by then? Okay? I understand. Bye. Dear Mr. Kurata. I am Tozaki. I sent you the manuscripts about which I interviewed the other day. Would you check them please? Tozaki. As I thought. He really loved me. I guess I can't forget my first love so easily. Hello. Your appartment is near Ogikubo station, right? Uh... yes. Is it the right address on your business card? Uh? Well.... It could be that... you are coming to my place? Yeah. Well.... I am almost there. Eh...? No.... I don't think that is a good idea. There is nothing special to be seen here. And it is a small room. No really. Nothing to be seen. Better not. I'm serious. Nothing special. Yes He is fast. Kurata... Why? I feel like doing it again. Huh? Huh!!! What are you saying? Suddenly coming here at midnight? So you are okay if we are not intimate anymore? Of course not. Well... Then there is no problem, right? If you want to do it, There is no need of being your partner. I'm saying I want to do it with you. But you refusing me? Don't run away from me. Tozaki. I'm here cause I want to have sex with you. There is no sweet tone in his voice. Nor expressions and feelings. My head knows it, but.... The moment I touch his heat, both my feelings and body betray me. Keep it up there! I... quit the track club. Eh? I'm transferring to another school. Is that so? Where... are you moving to? I'm not telling. What? Huh? I have a hickey. See you. What? Won't you have breakfast? 'See you', huh? Chi... He is not my boyfriend. Biting me like this... Is it going to be okay? 'I'll visit your place this Saturday. Kurata.' Hello. Is it you Kurata? Listen.... About your toothbrush.... I know you said, anything is fine, but I don't know which one to choose. So? Ah... You bought it already? Well... It is Marlboro Menthol. 4mg tar, isn't it? It is easy to remember your brand of cigarettes, because you are a heavy smoker. Yeah. Okay. I'm hungry too and will be back soon. See you then. Good heaven! Sorry I am late! I forgot to buy cheese and... Hey. Welcome back. Senpai! I brought you this. Here. Thank you for coming all the way here. Ah, well... This is.... We have already introduced ourselves. Nah. He told me he met his old friend lately, but I did not know that the two of you are so close to visit each other. Come on, Senpai! And you two are so close to bring the document all the way here? Yup. Keisuke and I used to be in a relationship. Oh... I see. Well.... A lot of things happened. That's enough. I received the documents. And you should leave. Yeah... Sure... Sorry for the disturbing. Mr. Kurata. See you again. I'm leaving first. Have fun. It's surprising. He is your type? Just because of this, you brought the documents? It is not a rush job? Sort of. Does he usually visit you at weekends? No. It is the first time. Senpai! Stop it! I'll cook. You... You told him that you sleep with me. Of course not! There is no way. But... He seemed to know everything. It does not feel like just a senior and junior relationship. What is your relationship with him? Have you ever slept with him? Yes I have. When we were dating, I did it with him. Ah... That's why you got jobs from him. He was after me when we were in university. That's true. But we broke up. That's not the reason why I get the jobs. Getting jobs from your ex. I don't get it... We dated long time ago. What I have with Senpai... is only work related. What's wrong with that? Shut up! I can't care less. Take your clothes off! Going to do it? There is no other reason why I visit you. Right? No! Stop it! I'm not in the mood for doing it now. Shut up! As long as it feels good... How was it, our first time? And with him? Kurata!!! You are acting weird! Are you jealous? Are you stupid? It looks nice this way, isn't it? No way! Hello Keisuke! Are you fine after last weekend? Excuse me for a moment. Senpai... You came over on purpose, did not you? So something really happened? Anyway Senspai. It was you who got told to leave. Jealousy, huh? I have not idea. But... Getting jobs from my ex.... He was not capable of understanding. Ku-ra-ta! You must not email when working. Sorry! Hello! It's Miyata. Sorry for calling so suddenly. The other day, I could not introduce myself properly. I would like to do it anew. I already have your busines card. Well... True... But it is my fault that you and Keisuku had a fight. I wanted to explain it to you. Welcome! Hey... Sorry. But can we sit somewhere else? Of course. This way. Would you like something to drink? Is it going to take long? Excuse me. I want another of the same. Okay. I'll get straight to the point. I dated Keisuke when he was a student. He came to work at my company. And because he was my junior, we are close. You don´t mind if I smoke= Please, go ahead. I approached him first. Our relationship lasted for half a year. I know that the story upsets you. But please! Don´t be cruel to Keisuke because of it. What did you hear from Tozaki= He said that Mr. Kurata could not grasp his feelings, about getting job from his ex. Here you are. So... in other words you want to say, that I should mind my own business, whether I understand it or not. No! If you understand it, there won't be any misunderstanding. You really think like that? Your story has the opposite effect. I know that. I... I want Keisuke to be happy. I can't be his lover, as long as he is work-related with me. I want to watch over him. And so? You wanted to warn me? If you are that attached to him, you should get back together again. Is it okay if this happens? You don't need my permission. I'll leave now. If it was so easy going back together, we would not have broken up in the first place. Mr.Kurata! It's ringing. Okay. Excuse me. Hello. Ah. It's Tosaki. Um... I have something to give you. Um... This is from Mr. Miyata. 'Mr. Kurata. I apologize for what happened last time. Miyata.' What an annoying guy. Has anything happened between the two of you? It is nothing. To get a job after breaking up is just normal for you. Or is it.... because of being gay? Is that the reason? Instead of saying that it is common... We dated a long time ago.... Since then, he is a person who brings people together thru work. To me, this affair is something I can't comprehend. However... Sorry for the last time. Kurata. It's okay. Stop thinking about it. Allright. Well then. I'll be going for today. Ah... How about lunch? I ate at work. You know... Are you free this weekend? Handphones can nowadays do anything. People can watch video and news. And can check stocks too. Is that so? Yes. Did something good happen? No... Not really. Ah... Really? Well then. What are the main functions? Right. We can't like that saying the place to a client. Is it alright? Although it is fine this way... but the place where the main characters experience... It is better to change that. Are you done? Are you crying? I'm not crying. You are sad, eh? Eh? What are you laughing about? Here. That's right. Let's go. Why are you now crying? By the way... Eh... What's that? Only a little. It's healthy for the body. I don't like pepper! Really. No need. Really! Don't worry! I said it's alright! Leave it up to me! It becomes yummy. My curry... It is delicious, isn't it? So spicy! It is not! It is. Really spicy! Super spicy! Calm down! Thank you for the hardwork! It is good, isn't it, Kurata? It is good after a drink. Shut up! It is always me who drives! What's with you... It's great! Stop it! Cold? No. It's not. But you just sneezed. It's my nose that is itchy. In this place... Really? Let me check. You really don't have. It's not funny. From the report we can notice the procedure that already has been done. And the increase. Especially the statitic already indicates it. Well.... Everyone from here.... I'll explain it next. Yes. Excuse me. This is the 3D diagram. You have not slept for awhile, haven't you? Yeah... If the boss gets to know, I'll be fired right away. So troublesome. You are always like that, Kurata. Every single day coming to work you get stressed out to sleep. Is it so obvious? Anyway... Please rest for now. It would be bad if you get sick. I guess so. Still with someone? Yeah. Your current girlfriend? Meeting her at weekends is the reason why you working so hard. Like me. I know it is troublesome, but you should sleep more. Drop me here. You are really late! Ah! Kurata! Feeling uncomfortable? Gee... Sweating all over? Ah... I'm getting off! Ah... You woke up. Are you okay? Yeah. More comfortable now. Seems your fever went down. You worked all night long? Yes. Until now. Sorry. For suddenly coming here. Don't worry. Ah. Right. You know... The next time, there is no need to wait outside like yesterday. If you come, stay here. Are you sure? Is it not the place where you do your work? If I am here, would I not get in your way? Ah... It might be really hard. I'm lying. I can manage it. You won't disturb me. Just like that? Eh? You're doing it again! Idiot. Hurts, hurts! You always wear it, don't you? Up until now, you show.... I like you. Kurata. Shousei. Excuse me. Sorry for disturbing. I have finished talking with him. Thank you for the hard work. Nice to meet you. What you have written has taste. I saw one that Mr. Miyata showed me. Well... It is the company's representative. Who wanted to work with you. Is that so? What you wanted has been transferred into your account. Let a different photographer and movie director do it each time. The inspiration from these shots... Please. Point them out. Actually... We wanted to find someone famous to do it. But I wanted to see how you would manage it. I can't believe it. Such a big project... I had never dreamed about it. Also this. We will give to the movie the drawing and captions for the first time. The writer should take a look. Regarding that if it will be published, we count on you, Mr. Tozaki. Yes. Likewise! Please take care of me. Is it going fine like that? Yes. Ah., right, right! This got here today. Is it from the office? Not that I like it, but... If you want, go watch it together with your girlfriend. Hello? Ah... Tozaki. Do you have plans for later? Ah. Sorry. Actually... I have to start working now. I see. Never mind then. Is it important? No. Not really. I see. I am really sorry, making you contact me... It is okay. Well then. See you. Going alone? Senpai! You should have told me that you were coming. I suddenly got spare time. That's why I'm here. Ah... Is that so? -Mother!- -How are you feeling?- You! Be quiet. Watch. Why...? Look at the feelings they expose, Okay? Okay. I'll do my best. -Is that so?- -Want to be punched?- -The ambulance came yesterday.- - Is it not better to tell it to the police?- -Police?- Ah! What's up> Just go inside. Did not I say so? Let's go. Hurry up. Wanne drink something? Where did you go? Because of my next job, I had to go watching a movie. By yourself? Yeah. Really? What a coincidence. I was there as well. You were with Miyata. Ah... It's not like that! I went by myself. It happened that Miyata-senpai was there. I went to hotel myself. But it happened that I met my ex-friend at the lobby. If you hear such an excuse, would you believe it? Kurata... Where are you heading to with that? You can go back to him. The guy told me that. Eh...? You can't end it. No...! I went... Stop it! Miyata and you, all together. What is not clear? That... You are the worst. Showing that kind of face... What are you saying? You have slept with him before getting here, isn't it? What? You keep blaming me, but why would you want me not to go? Do as you like, but take some responsibility for it! Stop it!!! Since I like you... In this way... to continue it... in this mood... What am I to you, damn it? If you won't give me your answer... Yeah... right... It's only my body that you like. Not because you remember me. I am always so naive. Naive. I'm tired of it already. This kind of feeling, is even painful, while sleeping at night. Also... Keep distance. What are you saying? Yeah... It's okay. Here. Thank you. We came often here. Till when are you going to make that face? Tozaki. I don't want to be comforted by you, senpai. Well... Sorry then. It is my fault that things happened. It is not really your fault, senpai. It's between Kurata and me. That guy... Leave him. I don't want to see you like this. I don't know since when it is going on, but you better stop it. (Good advice boy. Listen to it-Manvagtoo) Sorry. I can't. If it is not Kurata, I can't. It's because he is your first love, right? It's not! I don't like him because of back then. I like, the current Kurata more. Now it is me who is sad. I'm going back. How about you? I'll stay a little while. I understand. That guy is like the sea. Like watching the sea. The main is the sea, and the mood of sadness. Both combined. The next is... I'm thinking about you. I remember you as that sea. I am attached to your smile. In that sea, you opened your heart for me. I will not let go. I refuse. In order to stop and bring you happiness. There are no words to describe it. What are you doing right now? Looking at me? Even separated now, you saw my heart clearly. Despite breaking up, I can't stop thinking about you. I want you. I miss you. I miss you!!! Just everything about you. Why the long face? Leave me alone. Can you give me a helping hand? It's about firm's advertisement, made by him. Is it not good? Just see where the thought of love came. I want you. I miss you... I miss you. Just only you. Hey! Wait! Where are you going? Yes? I saw the magazine. I'll be waiting for you near the sea, until you come. I'll keep on waiting. That time... I knew that Tozaki was looking at me. I wanted him to say ihe likes me. But after meeting again, the feelings in my heart could not be satisfied. Seeing into the past, I would only be annoyed. I know that myself. Also... that Tozaki liked me. Although knowing it then, I did not give that guy anything in return. The feeling, erupted from meeting again is... only just one word... one word. You... Calling me like that to this place? I like you Tozaki. Do you remember this? This is... mine? When we were riding the bus together, you dropped it. So I kept it. You kept looking at it? I did not mean it this way... The last time. Please, ignore it. It's okay. It's like that. Hey. It's fine you calling me 'Keisuke'. Keisuke. Can I call you 'Shousei" You already do. Eh? When I was ill and sleeping. I heard it. Found out, huh? If it is you. I know everything. During high school, I fell in love for the very first time. For a long period of time, this love disappeared like bubbles. But we met again. Once again falling deeply in love.
