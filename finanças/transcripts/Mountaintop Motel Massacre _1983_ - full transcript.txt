I'll have another question or two I'd like to ask you. - I'll be around. - Evelyn. - And so we find it impossible to accept the death of one so young, the Lord's reason for taking her from us is beyond our comprehension, but within our faith. Our faith not to question but to accept as is evident in the song of Zechariah. - [Ghostly Male Voice] She killed her didn't see? - [Creepy Voice] Yes and she's still crazy. - [Ghostly Female Voice] Mama says you're crazy. - You'll be known as the prophet of High. We'll have a moment of silent prayer. (car engine revving) Dear heavenly father, we commend to thy loving care the body of this child, whom we loved so dearly. Blessed (mumbling) that their sorrow may become bearable. Forgive us of our sins and we will thank thee forever and ever, amen.

Thank you. Room four, just married. Well I'll see to it that you're not disturbed. Oh and tell your little wife I'll have a surprise for her. - Thanks. - Oh just a moment. Here, in case the lights go out. - I'd imagine the lights could be out anywhere. (foreboding music) (groaning) (car engine revving) (ominous music) (cheering) - Woo! Don't say it! - I wasn't going to say a word. I was taught if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. - Funny, very funny. - Let's get in bed. - Yeah. Vernon. Vernon what is this? - Just an old sack, throw it in the corner. (foreboding music) - [Melvin] How long you been a preacher anyway? - I been spreading the good news about 25 years. And it beats the heck out of selling life insurance or bibles, that's how it come I started preaching you know. Selling bibles. Two Sundays ago, way back to April in 1955, I've saved over 500 people. - Yeah but your preaching don't say nothing about drinking does it? - Sure it does. (mumbling) forever. A long slow process. Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. - No, (mumbling) in a night. - The Kingdom of Heaven isn't some place up there in the clouds, it's here and now in your heart. - If the Kingdom of Heaven is in my heart, where's the Kingdom of Hell? - Well I uh, I guess it's there also. I've seen your tools over there, I guess you're in the construction business in some kind? - Yep, journeyman carpenter. - [Bill] I hope you're here for work. - No, just looking. - Business is kinda down out there isn't it? - Man let me tell you something. I haven't been outta work since I was 16 years old. And I ain't never seen nothing like this. - Well, to tell you the truth about it. I ain't been exactly setting the woods on fire and saving souls myself. Well Melvin, I think I'll turn in. Good night. - Night, Bill. - [Woman] Yes, hello? - Louise, Al. - [Louise] Al, where are you, it's late. - Yeah I know, look I'm about 20 miles north of Mina. I'm in a heavy rainstorm, I can barely see the drive. Do you have a motel guide at the apartment? - [Louise] Uh, yeah, I think so. - [Al] Get it for me, would you? See if you can find me the closest motel. - [Louise] Do you know which highway you're on? - Yeah, 71. - [Louise] Okay, let's see here, 71. Yeah, here we go, about 12 miles north of Mina, there's one called Mountaintop Motel. - Great, you're a sweetheart of a secretary, Louise. - [Louise] Gee, thanks. You're gonna like this motel, it's real cheap. Must be a favorite stopover for advertising men. - Oh are we a smartass now? - [Louise] Drive carefully. - Okay, thanks baby. (women chattering) - Why don't you ever watch where you're going! - Sorry! - Oh this is so dumb, (mumbling). - You couldn't do any better! - Oh this is so stupid we're out here in the middle of nowhere. - I know. - Damn. What are we doing out here anyway? - Oh thank God a car, wave him down, wave him down, maybe he'll give us a lift! - Maybe he's a pervert. - Prissy, come on now be nice. Hey stop! - Get in. - Will you give us a ride? - Oh yeah, it'd be great (mumbling).

I'd be mad too if I'd been caught out in this rain, (mumbling), like that. My name's Al. - I'm Tanya, this is my cousin Prissy. - Cousins? You kinda look like cousins. - This sure is some car. - Yeah and look a telephone, you must be rich or something. - Oh no, nothing like that. - [Tanya] Well are you a lawyer? - No but I keep dozen of them working full time. You girls ever hear of Columbia Records? Well that's mine, that's my baby. - My God, you must know Barbara Mandrell! - [Al] Sure do, blonde's made a fortune. - Well what are you doing down here. - Uhm, on a talent search. As a matter of fact I was heading down to Shreveport to audition a group, if they're good enough I'll give 'em a break. - You know what? ' W] What? - Me and Prissy sing too. - [Al] No kidding. - Oh Tanya shut up. - Well we do, we sang in the Springfield Country Jamboree last Saturday night. ' W] Really? - Tanya the Jamboree is a long way from being able to make records. - I know, but it wouldn't do any harm, maybe Al would listen to us at the motel. - Oh shut up you're embarrassing me, he don't wanna listen to us. - Well it never hurts to ask, does it Al'? - No, you can't be bash in this business. - See there. Well, how about it? Will you listen to us. - We'll see.

It requires me to be totally honest with myself, with everybody. But you do need a little polishing. But hey with the right Nashville producer, a good vocal coach, background vocals. Hey, I might be wrong, but, you girls could be on the cover of our next major album release. - Sweet, I can't believe it! Our own record album! Recorded in Nashville? - Yup, with the A-Team. Best musicians in the world. You don't wanna make this a solo album do you? (ominous music) - [Ghostly Voice] Mama. (ghostly voice murmuring) - What's wrong? - What's wrong, what's wrong with you? Dropping your dress for a big phony like that! - Ssshht, you don't know for sure he's a phony. Look, we're staying here all night long, and for all I care you can go through your whole dull, small town life and never take a chance on anything. But not me, boy. If I see an opportunity, or what even slightly resembles an opportunity, I'm gonna jump on it. - You do that. - With or without you. - [Al] Don't want you to catch a cold. (ominous music) - I'm worried about Prissy. - She's just hacked off. I heard a string rip. - Prissy? I gotta go see. - No, no, I'll go. - [Tanya] Well, I'm going with you. That's blood! Prissy, Prissy! Where is she? - [Al] She's not in here. ' [Tanya] Prissy! - [Al] Stop it! - See anything? Well what could, what could have happened? How could she just disappear? - I don't know Tanya, I'll find out, I'll find out. (siren wailing) I've got to go warn the others. - Please don't leave me alone. - I've got to. - [Tanya] But? - Chain-lock the door behind you, I'll be back in a few minutes. And don't go in there. - Hey, did I hear screaming? - There's been an accident. - What, where? - One of the girls in my room. She's disappeared. There must've been some kind of struggle because of the blood everywhere. - When? - Just now, we need to let everybody know. - [Melvin] Well wasn't your door locked. - I could've sworn I locked the door myself. Lightning knocked the tree down, it's blocked the road a ways back, I'll tell the girl and her husband in number four. (door banging) - Who is it? Who is it? - It's me Al! How's he doing? - He doesn't seem to be in much pain, did you find a doctor? - Yeah help's on the way. - They'd better get here soon. - I'm sure he'll be all right, something else has happened. - What? - There's a girl missing. Something's going around here, you need to keep your door locked and keep your eyes open, I'll be back later to check on you. There's a guy named Crenshaw two doors down if you need anything, and don't open this door unless you know who it is, all right? - I asked him that, he said he locked his door personally. - Tell you what, I'm getting outta here. - No place to go, the road's blocked. (door banging) - ls there anybody else? - Just the old woman in the office. - Better stay on your toes, let me know if you see anything. - I'll be right next door if you need me. - Look, wait a minute, let me get my shoes and I'll go with you. - Okay, see you in a second. (foreboding music) - Evelyn, how'd you get in here? - Away Satan! - [Bill] No! (sudden sting) (eerie music) (whimpering) (door banging) (screaming) - Tanya, Tanya, it's me, open the door. There, there it's okay. - Get us out of here! - It's okay, I can't. - Why not? - You saw the tree down, there's no way out of here. - I can't stay here anymore. - You've got to. I'll be right here with you, I'll take care of you, you've got to trust me. (whimpering) There's something I have to tell you. I've been lying to you. I don't own any record company. I'm an advertising executive from Memphis. I was just having a little fun. - Prissy was right, you're just a big phony. Congratulations, I hope you got what you wanted. - If something's going to happen it would've already happened. - You're probably right. The poison seems to be wearing off. - What does it feel like? - My face is so sore. But the main thing is, (mumbling). - Like what? - [Vernon] Things don't look or seem like they're supposed to. - Don't worry. I am not going to let anything else happen to you. I wonder where the help could be. I can't imagine what's keeping them. - I'm tired of this bullshit. People running around here with snakes, roaches and rats. Killing off one another. No way Jose am I gonna stay here no more. Where's the (mumbling) preacher? Reverend, you better come on, because if you don't, you're gonna miss me, I'm leaving, and I don't mean later, I mean right now. Hell I'll sleep in the truck first, is what I'll do, I've slept there before, and I'll sleep there again. Thing is, that truck ain't got no crapper. Well what the hell am I paying for this room anyway? (eerie music) (door creaking) (police siren wailing) Open up, it's Melvin! Open up Bill I wanna talk to you! Are you okay in there Reverend? Okay, I'm coming in. (ominous music) - Who's there? - Crenshaw. I found out how've they been getting in, and it hasn't been through the front door. Come, let me show you. - Geez, look at this. (mumbling) - That'll do it. - How did you find it? - I didn't, it found me. - We've got to warn the others. - No need to warn the preacher, he's dead. - You know who's doing it? - I think it's the old lady. (mumbling) Let's go find out. - Tanya? We found where she's getting in, do you hear me? I've got to go, but I'll be back. - But you promised not to leave me. - I've got to, now you'll be safe, just don't panic. (police siren wailing) Hey, (mumbling) this. (eerie music) - [Melvin] Did it. - Maybe she's trapped down there, we've got to go see. - [Melvin] You mean we got to down there after her? - We have to, it's her of it's us. Come on, let's go back to the cabin. - Why don't we just wait and let the law go down and get her, shit they are the pros, let them boys go down there. - Look, we've gotta get to her before she gets to us. - And get my ass killed by some old crazy white woman? - Come on. (foreboding music) - And you think she's still down there? - Don't know, you got any other suggestions? - No. - The young couple, we've got to get to them. - If it ain't too late. - Open up, it's Al and Crenshaw. - What's wrong? - Thank God you're all right. - What is it? A hidden door in the bathroom? - I'm outta nails, get me that heavy chair that's over there will you please? - [Mary] What are you going to do with that? - Keep her out of here, she can't get past this. - That'll hold her, let's go. - Thank you, for all you help. - How you feeling buddy? Hang in there, we'll get you out soon. - Thanks again. - Listen, lock the door. (ominous music) - Vernon! (screaming) - [Vernon] No... - Aren't you a mess? (groaning) - Open up! She was hiding over here before. - I guess this is it. - Yeah, she's down there all right. - I'll start on this end in about 30 seconds, and one of us ought to meet her. - Good luck Crenshaw. - [Melvin] Good luck. (eerie music) - Open up Tanya, it's me. - Are they? - Yes. - [Tanya] Where are you going? - Down there. - [Tanya] You'll get killed. - Maybe. (mumbling) Here, lock yourself in the car. If I'm not back in five minutes, take off, drive it off in the woods somewhere, get out and run, but get the hell outta here. - Wait. Be careful. - You too Tanya. Now go. (ominous music) - It's 30 seconds, Al should be here. Al where are you? ~ Au Al! (ominous music) (screaming) - Crenshaw? You down here? You all right? - Open up, open up I'm the sheriff, open up.
