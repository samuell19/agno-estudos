HUNGAROFI LM PRESENTS ADOPTION Starring KATI BEREK Screenplay- Script Consultant Music - Editing Set - Costumes ALSO FEATURI NG MAFI LM STUDIOS, BUDAPEST Director of Photography Production Manager Directed by MARTA MESZAROS Hold your breath, please. Now take a deep breath. Once again. Again. And again. Now sigh. Again. The test results show you're in good health. Allow me a few questions all the same. - Have you lost weight recently? - Yes. Fifteen pounds in a year. That's quite a bit. Could family troubles be behind that? No. Is your social life in order? Do you have a partner? I live alone, but, yes, I have a friend. Did you ask for this checkup just because you're not sleeping well and you've lost your appetite? Or is there some other reason? I'd like to know whether I'm in good health, and whether, considering my age, I could still bear a child. Why not? You're 42, aren't you? I'm past 42. In your 43rd year. Have you used contraceptives in the past? Yes. In that case, there's nothing wrong, and there is no medical reason why you shouldn't be able to have a baby. - Want some more? - Thanks. You know that woman sitting over there? - Yes, by sight. - You do? I'm glad you're here. How long are you free? I have time. Joska, I want to discuss something seriously with you. I can't take this any longer. What? Don't you love me anymore? Yes, I do. Well, then? I want to have your child. - Did you just think of this now? - Yes,just now. Why? I need a child. But I know you won't agree. No, I certainly can't agree. - Why? - It would mess up everything. We've kept our relation secret for years. How does a child fit into that? A child isn't a toy. I'm not asking you to get a divorce. We already agreed I wouldn't. That's not the point. So now you've just decided to have a child. How do you intend to raise it? On your own? On my own. I'm cold. Let's go inside. This is madness. Will I rush from one home to the other? There's no need for that. I'll take care of everything. I'm not young, but I'm healthy. I had a checkup. We just have to decide. Don't you see the child would only suffer, growing up without a father? I just don't understand you. Why? Because I'm scared. Scared of what might happen. Tell me... have you never thought about it? What? That someday I might want to have your child. No. I'm going. Now you're upset. No, I understand that you don't want it. What will happen now? Nothing. Kata, you can't do this. What? Make it look like it's all my fault. I make you unhappy and ruin your life. Right? I never said such a thing. You know how much I love you. Yes, I know. Let's not quarrel. How's your father? My father? He moved out. Poor guy. We'll need to buy furniture, now when I'm totally broke. He should have moved out a long time ago. If it hadn't been for you, I couldn't have managed. You'll have your peace now. Perhaps. You sure she lives in this house? How do you know? Hello. Is it all right if we come in? Are you working? Yes, but it's all right. - What are these? - Picture frames. Look at this. - Did you make these? - Yes. - Are you a carpenter? - No, my father was. - Do you live here alone? - Yes. And where do you live? We live at the institute. And what are you doing here? Just wandering around the village. I'm sorry I've got nothing in the house to offer you. It doesn't matter. We'll be going. Good-bye. I'd like to ask you something. What? You live alone, and you've got two rooms, don't you? Yes. A boy comes to see me every week. We've got nowhere to go. Perhaps we could come here. We'd pay. I don't care about the money, but I don't like having strangers around. I thought you were all right, but you're just like the rest. Are you afraid of girls from the institute? They won't even let us into the Cultural Center. I'm not a thief. I asked for a favor, that's all. In summer it's easier, but it's cold now. I'm not afraid of anybody. I'm not afraid of you either. I just don't want anything to do with it. DearJoska, don't be upset about what I said. I didn't mean to hurt you. I kept thinking about it all day. - Isn't Anna here? - Anna who? - Anna. - Who is Anna? My friend who came back to see you. Why would she be here? She said she was coming here. She didn't. And what's eating you? I wrote to my mother. So? The director won't let me in. He told me to write another letter. Why? What did you write? I don't like to read others' letters. Read it out loud for me. ''My parents, this is my last letter to you. I know my fate doesn't concern you in the least. Nevertheless, I belong to you. I told you a lot of lies, but I had good reason. Mother, you gave me birth and then you were done with it. I don't know you. You robbed me even of that. Do you know what motherly love means? I regret not having gone to live with my father. I'm sorry you wouldn't even let me get to know him. I often dream of him. I'm very fond of him. I'll look for him when I get out of here, and I'll help him. I'll tell him what my mother is like. I often ran away from home, but only because you beat me regularly. I didn't always deserve it, and certainly not with a rope or strap. Why the hell did you come to visit, only to disown me again? Did you need a maid at home? I'm aiming higher than that. Thanks for dredging everything up once again. I wasn't ashamed of eating too much. I ate so little at home because I hated what you cooked. I loathe your soup and your pork chops. You're hypocrites, both of you. I don't need you. I'll become a skilled worker and get married, and I'll forget I ever had a mother. I detest your husband. A stranger has no right to hit me. He won't live long. His nerves are wrecked. Mother, I'm sorry, but I don't love you. You messed up my life. I'll never write you again, and don't you write me. Your loving one-time daughter. Mother, try to be happy.'' How long have you been in an institute? Since I was six. - Are you looking for someone? - Yes. Who? A girl. I'm from the village. - What's her name? - I only know her Christian name. Anna. We have a lot of Annas here. She's a brunette with nice gray eyes. A very pretty girl. I know who you mean. Anna Balint. But you can't speak to her now. Come back during visiting hours. - Are you the director here? - Yes. DearJoska, don't be upset about what I said. I didn't mean to hurt you. I kept thinking about it all day, and I'm sorry about the whole thing. I'm afraid you misunderstood me. DearJoska, don't be upset... Hi. Won't you come in? Do come in. How did you get here? I ran away. Have you got a cigarette, ma'am? You may call me Kata. I have some in the workshop. - Your husband? - I don't have one. - Never had one? - Yes, I did. Watch out. They'll see me. Let's go inside. - May I stay? - Yes, but what will you do? I have to wait for Sanyi. - He promised he'd come. - When? Tomorrow. And then what? Then I'll go back to the institute. They'll transfer me to a different facility. Take off your coat. - Am I disturbing you? - No. What are you doing? Writing a letter. - Go on. - I can't. - Because of me? - No. I don't quite know what to say. ''DearJoska, don't be upset about what I said. I didn't mean to hurt you. I kept thinking about it all day, and I'm sorry about the whole thing. I'm afraid you misunderstood me.'' Are you really sorry? What did you tell him? I'm not sorry. I told him I wanted his child. - How long have you known him? - Five years. He's married. Two kids. We meet in secret. - What's he do? - He's a locksmith. - Is he getting a divorce? - No, we agreed on that. Do you really want his child? Yes. And he doesn't want to, right? Don't you want to talk about it? No, we can talk about it. Will you stay with him? Yes. - Why? - Because I love him. - Do you make good money? - No, but I could support a child. Then why did you ask him? It would be dishonest not to. You should have known what he'd say. I didn't. Why did you come to the institute? I was curious. You could be my daughter. I've had enough of parents. Is your mother alive? Yes. And so is my father. But let's not talk about that. - You're a good cook. - You like it? I just learned how. I had to after my mother died two years ago. - Did you have enough? - Yes, thank you. The ladle? I'll take the soda bottle. You better sleep on the couch in the other room. I get up pretty early. As you like. Sleep tight. - May I come in for a moment? - Okay. Come in. I thought about this thing. A child would do you good. Did you never want one before? Of course I did. But at first we had nothing. It wasn't possible. Then my husband died, and now Joska won't let me. But you'd still have one living on your own? Yes. I asked Joska, but I can see his point too. He's got two kids and a wife. Perhaps he's right. A child at 43. I'm crazy. No, you're not. But don't adopt one. Abandoned children are all wounded. - Shall I wake you in the morning? - No. I hardly sleep anyway. I wake up a lot. Are you tired? Terribly. Then I'll be going. - Won't they be looking for you? - Yes. But not until tomorrow. What's up? Nothing. Well, then? - Sanyi is here. - Why doesn't he come out? He'd rather stay in there a while. I'd like to go back in as well. Do whatever you like. Hand me my robe, will you? I love you. I love you. Do everything as we agreed, and look after yourself. Let me introduce you. - I'm Sandor Horvath. - Mrs. Csentes. Must you go? Yes. I only took one day off. I'm sorry. Have a good trip. Thank you. Well, we'll be going. Good-bye. - Will you see me to the gate? - Yes. What's the matter? What's the problem? Nothing. - Well, I'm off. - Please don't go. I don't let anyone hit me. I don't care why you did it, but I've been beaten enough for a lifetime. Where do you intend to go? Back to the institute. - Can I help you in some way? - No. You've helped a lot. There's nothing more you can do. Don't be angry with me. I'm very much on edge. Very much. Please. Sanyi looks like a real nice boy. Yes, I know. I want to marry him, but I can't yet. I'm not of age. What can be done? I don't know. You said your director is a decent man. Couldn't he help? No, not him, but maybe the director at the Cultural Center. And your parents? They couldn't care less. I'll be going. - I'll come see you again at the institute. - Do that. Do you hate to go back? Very much. And if you don't go? They'll come take me by force. Wait. I'll go with you. We were just about to start looking for you. - I said I'd be back. - What is it? - Anna stayed with me for two days. - What can I do for you now? Let her stay with me for a few more days. No, it's against regulations. For her own sake, Anna must be transferred. We'll find a place for her at another institute. Please get ready. We'll be going shortly. Good-bye. I'll find out where they send you. Bye. How do you know this girl? What does that matter? Come inside. I'm pleased that you like her. But the situation isn't simple. She's very unstable. We've had a lot of problems with her. She drifted around for years. We picked her up in all sorts of places. She kept running away. She's been in almost all our institutes. Now she wants to marry this boy. Why is that such a big deal? She's underage. Her parents must agree, and they won't hear of this marriage. Why? They think their daughter is a whore. Didn't they place her in the care of the state? No. The state took her under its wings. Why? The parents neglected her. She went off with men. She slept around. There was danger of real corruption. Now the parents act like they had nothing to do with it. Look, this kid could be my daughter, my friend. Her fate interests me. What will become of her? The director of our center would need to authorize her release from state custody, since her parents are able to look after her. And then her parents would have to agree to her getting married. What would you say to this marriage? She's never been attached to anyone before. Now, for a year, there's been only this boy for her. This may be the strong bond that will favorably affect her personality. If Anna's parents agreed to this marriage, would your boss consent to it too? I don't know. That's something to discuss with him. Come in. Good morning. - May I speak to the director? - One moment. You have a visitor, sir. Please go in. Hello. My name is Kassas. Mrs. Csentes. Since you live in that village, you must understand that Anna had to be transferred. She'll be here a few more days. Then we'll find another institute for her. Could I speak to her? She's still restless. I've known her a long time. Talking to her wouldn't do her any good now. I haven't talked to her myself. We must wait till she quiets down. Will she quiet down this way? Why do you want to talk to her? To ask her something. Hello. I want to talk to you. Go ahead. Would you come with me? - Yes. Where to? - To my place. It's not up to me. You have to ask the director. There's something wrong with me. I haven't been doing well the last few days. If he lets you go, will you come? Yes, I will. -Just a moment, sir. - Yes? Would you let Anna come with me? If it's important to you, then yes. Let me ask you: If Anna's parents consent to this marriage, would you authorize it? I've talked to her parents repeatedly, and I know the boy well. Marriage would do her good. - They let you go. - I'll get changed. I have something to do. You'll wait, won't you? No, I'll go with you. You said you weren't well. Don't come. I have to talk toJoska. I'd like to see him. Don't worry- I won't interfere. Don't cry. Don't cry. This isn't right. You meet when he wants to. When he's got the time. You ought to leave him. Come on. Let's go have dinner. Let's sit here. I'll call the waiter. Excuse me. - How can I help you? - A menu, please. I'd like the fried liver. Two brandies and two fried livers. What soup do you have? - Beef consomm?. - Very good. Thank you. Seven o'clock. Is the music all right? May I? If you don't mind, I'd rather not. Listen, girl. Stay with me. I'll bring you up. I've had enough of parents. I'd rather get married. - Will this nightie do? - Yes, fine. I need this boy. I've grown to love him. I want to stay with him. I'll learn a trade later. I'll put some soda in the wine. It's chilly here. Don't catch cold. Here, my lovely girl. Cheers. To your health. I'm Mrs. Csentes from the institute. May I talk to you about your daughter? Anna's been in town for two days now. Yes, we know. Don't you want to visit her? Perhaps we will. Do you know she wants to get married and that your consent is needed? - Did the institute authorize it? - The director hasn't yet decided. My husband won't hear of it. We don't agree. She's much too young for that. Anna is very set on this marriage. We know our daughter. She's been set on lots of things before. What if she changes her mind in a year and hits the road again? What happens in a year will depend on the boy too. We don't know the boy. He's here with me. Shall I call him? - Good day, ma'am. - Hello. How old are you? Twenty-two. How much do you make? 2,300. Where would you live? With my parents. What's their apartment like? Two rooms, with all amenities. How many are living there? Father, Mother, Granny and me. Have you thought this over? Do you know about Anna's past? She told me everything. Tell the boy why you oppose this marriage. Arguing won't get us anywhere. We'd never convince each other anyway. I'd like to lay down certain conditions. What conditions? Anna has given me a lot of trouble. I want to be on the safe side, should she change her mind once again. I'd like you to sign a declaration. You won't back out of the marriage. After the wedding, she'll move into your place, and she can stay on there, even if you should get divorced. Will you sign that? I will. Then I'll dictate it to you. - What's your name? - Sandor Horvath. ''I, the undersigned, undertake: One: I will marry Anna Balint come what may, if her parents agree and if she's released from state care. Two: We will move in with my parents. Three: Should we get divorced, she may stay on in our place.'' - May I sign now? - Sign it. Let's go. As you like. Good-bye. Good-bye. - Well, that's taken care of. - Thanks a lot. Hi. You're late. I thought you'd never come. Sorry I'm late. A drink? Yes, cherry. Two cherry brandies, please. Are we going? I couldn't meet the old boy, so there's no key. Let's go eat at the Fishermen's Dive. I don't feel like going there now. I'd rather be alone with you. Don't you understand there's no key? Where shall we go? You're lying. You didn't go for the key, so the old boy brought it to me. I'm getting scared of you, Kata. What do you mean? Scared you'll get pregnant and not tell me. That's not how I want to live with you,Joska. I want peace. You needn't be scared. I never lie to you. I love you very much, and you can live just as you like. I'm tired. I'm going home. You know what? Come to our place. That's nonsense,Joska. You'll see my family, my kids. You can think about it. - No, I won't go. - Are you afraid? No, but this is madness. Isn't what you want madness too? Come on. Hello. Erzsi, I've told you about my coworker at the factory. - My name is Kata. Mrs. Csentes. - Hello. Please sit down. Coffee? Yes, thank you. - What does your husband do? - He's a carpenter. - Is he at the factory too? - Yes. Kids? Two sons. One is 1 5 and the other's 1 1 . I always wanted to go to work, butJoska wouldn't let me. So I stayed home with the kids. I've always worked, but I'm not sure which is the better way. Kids are just as important as anything else. Yes, but they're big now. I'm bored. I'm never around people. It's true. They're big enough. You could go to work. - Do you know a trade? - No. You could be trained in a year, if you wanted. You could make 2,200 a month. They're hiring at the factory. I like her to stay home. There's enough to do here. That's true. There's plenty to do here. It's late. I must go. They're waiting for me. - Good-bye. - I'll see you to the gate. No, thank you. Just have your dinner in peace. Erzsi will see me out. Cheers. Are you here to see Anna? No, I'm here on business of my own. I received a letter from Anna's parents. They've consented to the marriage. I'm happy to hear that. And what brings you here? I want a child. Don't you have one? Unfortunately, no. Husband? No. - Are you ill? - Me? Of course not. I had a checkup. The doctor said I could have a baby. But the man I love has a family and kids. I don't want him to get divorced. I've got enough money and a home. I could support a child just fine. I want to adopt one. When did you decide this? When I got to know Anna. You must send an application to this address. The social worker will prepare a report on you. You'll need to obtain a medical certificate, and we'll put you on the waiting list. Then we'll look for the sort of child you request. You need to think this over carefully. Adoption is a pretty serious business. A child isn't a commodity. Our experience is that we can usually find the desired child. When can all this be arranged? It's too early to tell precisely. It's very important to me. Let's dance, kids! Come on, everyone! ''Acknowledgement of receipt of child from State Institute. I, the undersigned, take my child, Monika Csentes, born on March 8, 1 97 4, permanently into my own care, thereby removing her from state custody and relinquishing any and all future claims against the Infants' Facility.'' Please sign here. Good-bye.
