Our epics say that Parasurama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu flung an axe and created Kerala, the land of pepper. But for the western world, it was Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese sailor, who discovered Kerala. In 1498 to enter into India roaming around African country... Young achiever Vasco gathered his men Paulo da Cama, Michel & Bonsalo... He started his journey in 4 ships with the blessing is Manuel king. The men on the ships were mostly convicts... Sailing, they finally reached Melindi in Africa... threatened the king and got a Gujarati pilot to join them. He guided them to Calicut. Kerala welcomed them as it welcomes all guests. Gama's logbook describes our people as men who pretended to know more than they did and short women lacking beauty. The Samoodiri, a powerful and God-fearing ruler showed no interest at all in Gama's gifts. At that time, pepper in Kerala was valued as highly as oil in the Gulf now. Gama's eyes were riveted on the pepper. Is this the Goddess? Will you give me this pendant? Gama offered to buy the pepper for three times its price. But Samoodiri showed no interest. Take him to the dining hall and give him food. Leaving some of his people behind, Gama left, none too pleased. Lisbon had grand celebrations in his honour. History praised Gama as the great man, who discovered a sea route to wealth. But the future of our country was jeopardized by a handful of pepper. Let history end there. This movie begins with two young men who have no interest in their own history and who don't believe that the past has a tendency to repeat itself Krishnadas, known as KD and Tan seer known as Tarzan. There's drumming in the north while we dance in the south... And you can see the eastern mynah in the south. There's drumming in the north while we dance in the south... And you can see the eastern mynah in the south. Give me money, then you play. I don't have money Wait for a week. I'll surely give. I swear on him. Daisy da Cunha. Head of the Real Estate Division of Nirvana a mining corporation. Our group is interested in your ancestral property in Kerala. But I don't have any property in Kerala. The property where a tribal school is being run... My mother's ancestral home. It was sold, taken away from us. No, no one took it away. Your grandfather, His Highness Ravi Varma Raja, leased it out. The lease has expired. As the last royal heir, you're the sole owner. How much is there? Official documents state that the land measures up to 102 acres. One acre has been inhabited by locals. You know the market value... Who's this? He is a Member of the Legislative Assembly of that region. Is your uncle an influential High Court Judge? Here's a small advance. We're offering 3 times the value. You can make inquiries and negotiate. If you need help, Kaimal is your man. I feel no nostalgia, no sense of homecoming. Thank God, you have no sentimental issues selling it to foreigners. That woman from the NGO looks after it now. She's tough. She'll have sob stories to tell. Say firmly that you've decided... Hey! Let me ask... Your teacher...? Did you bring it? -What? What a figure! Super! Who is she? Did you get scared, Krishnadas? I'm Bhumi. NGO... I wanted to thank you for running this institution all these years in my mother's name. There's a social issue involved in the sale of your property. I'm in no position to think of all that. You have to look at it in totality. There's an international mining corporation working behind the political nexus that brought you here. I know. Nirvana. They came to see me. Then you know the environmental hazards of mining in this region? Whose? So you don't have any kind of social commitment? No. According to your mother, the late Chandramani Thamburatti's decision 2 signatories are required to complete this sale. Who? There's no relative who won't succumb if offered money. If it's someone who doesn't even know what money is? After the death of this girl's mother, your mom took care of her. She was entrusted to my mother along with the keys to the school. She is a nominee. It's as if your mother foresaw what is happening today. Look, if you have no alternative, once the lease period is over... no one can prevent you from selling this property. As for this child all you need is her thumb impression. You just have to ask her. She's not capable of refusing or taking some other decision. But if you decide that you are definitely going to sell... this sale will destroy the faith of a 100 families... and the foundation we built this Institution on. You need to let them know. This is your mother's pen. Use it to sign the documents. So, are you going to meet them in the forest? Krishna! Tarzan! Not you! I'm calling Lord Krishna. God! Protect me it's because of you that I have to walk over stones and thorns. These people have a right over the land you're going to sell. They have their own customs. Come and meet Thangachan. Whom ...? Thangachan? I...! -Me. Get permission to sell from our chief, the tiger. Only the queen been remained. But that was enough for all of us to come back. Are you Thangachan? I ask the questions. Do you know who you are? I'm Krishnadas. Don't ask for my ID. Those men with guns took it away. Do you know Rama Varma Raja? He's my father. A cartoonist. He used to say that I'm the worst cartoon he drew! So you're my father's friend. Nice to meet you, Uncle. Untie me. This rock surface. So you know your father. Your father's father? Ravi Varma. You know your father's father. His father's father's father's father? I came here for a real estate deal... To sell my ancestral property. You needn't mock me. What do you want? You came to sell the land we stand on. Do you know the warrior, who shed his blood for it? You took crooked roads to get here. Before you sell, place a fistful of earth in your hand and think of your lineage. The Portuguese who brought money and gold to buy pepper swore to destroy our land. Your ancestor, Kelu, was then 8 years old. The convicts Vasco left behind looted our land without mercy. There was one person who could protect us. Father! They're attacking Abdu's wedding house. You enter my house and act insolent? You should know that this is Chirakkal that I am Chirakkal Kothuval. Did you cross the seas just to desecrate the soil of our land? Never harm a woman or a child. That's the rule of our Kingdom. Our country was his way to wealth knowing that, Vasco came again. Not to beg, but to wage war. He came with 15 warships and sighted a ship returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. He captured it. There were over 400 people in it including women and children. Al Faqi, its owner, offered him 4 shiploads of gold and pepper but Vasco denied the offer. These atrocities made the country furious. Ask the Dubash to write a letter. Let the Brahmin go with his son to negotiate. They will not harm a father, who comes unarmed with his son. I am ready. But to sacrifice my son... I have only him to perform my last rites. There's no time to talk 400 lives are in danger. I'll send my son. Chirakkal Kothuval's son, Kelu, will come with you to the ship. Are you scared'? Your mother and father are with you. Never bow down before an enemy. That is dharma. I will be with you. A father's promise. A whole country waited for their return. Vasco had expected the Samoodiri and Kothuval to come for talks. He despised these messengers and their strange customs. In the child's eyes he saw an enemy being born... a clan who would never surrender its pride. That foreign ship must sink into the sea with the sun today. No vestige of Vasco's arrogance must remain. From next year, Kothuval can perform obsequies for his son. You insult the land that feeds you forget Chenicheri's teachings. Only those who want to come need come Chenicheri Kurup remember his name. You'll soon meet him. Don't harm him, he's only a child. Is this how you behave towards those who come to make peace? Vasco sliced off the tongue and ears of the poor peace-maker. Vasco had his disobedient dog's ears sewn onto the poor man's face. The world now praises him as a great man! Father! Jump! Kelu, go! On the shore covered with corpses lay a mother, not quite dead. The jewels she'd wanted to give Vasco's men in exchange for her life... she gave to Kelu. He took them with hands that did not tremble and with a heart that burned. Ali found him there, cold and hungry and took him home. He nurtured within him, revenge. This sword called the Urumi needs a drop of your life. The Portuguese empire spread from Cochin to Goa. To halt its growth, a golden weapon with a soul of fire took life in him. 'A weapon must have inner strength'. His father's words guided him. The sword is not held in a warrior's hands, it has to be within him. Kelu grew up. His sole aim to kill Vasco. He learnt to walk in forests filled with beasts of prey. O forefathers! Show me a fire on which to roast him. Let it go, Vavvali. There's life in its belly. How? You're right. It's a female. My father said: 'Never harm Women and children'. Don't break that rule and bring evil upon us. Let it go. My mother told you not to starve me. Don't her words have value? You're right. There's life in its belly. My effort was futile, that's all. If you're hungry, you know we'll soon be home. Friend! From Chirakkal. Yes, it's Chirakkal's Princess. Lord Siva, let my country never want for grain. May its fame and prosperity spread over the seven seas. If you chase a beautiful woman, she'll blow your heart like a conch. Let her blow it! Let her keep blowing it! The girl standing at the shrine is Bala of Chirakkal... I want her alive, with her hands and legs bound only her! Stop wagging your tongue, show me how smart you are. Yes, I'm Chirakkal Bala. You can't tie me up, nor can you even touch a flower on the heads of my maids. Go and teach that arrogant fellow a lesson! It just made a sound and he died...? Go and inform the tainted foreign owners of this dirty weapon... that their death is drawing near. Go! Run off! What is this? You saw, it spits fire. A fire-spitter. Good muscle power...what about your Will power? Give it to me. This is not for hands that know only silver balls and golden cords. Ask your father, he might make you one like this to play with. Come, Vavvali. This was made by foreign hands, not by villagers. An invitation from the one we were searching for. Come, we have to go to Puthur. Let's not talk about foreigners. Talk about food, I'm hungry. Look, Allah has sent the food I want! So much for the elephant? See what I got! I'm so hungry! Who is that cheering, Who is that dancing in passionate abandon? We'll do a warrior-dance in the beautiful forest. It's him, my friend who is leading the team. It's true, so true. He came to keep us company. Look at the earth, it's earth that sprouts gold. It's where our forefathers shed their blood. Take all the good and reject the bad. Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness. Who is that cheering, who is that dancing in passionate abandon? We'll do a warrior-dance in the beautiful forest. Let's welcome the spring with festival drums. We are ready to dance and sing in the fields... Wear traditional dress. Stand in a circle. Clap your hands and sing and dance. See how our crops flourish and dance. O my friend! You're my very soul. Take all the good and reject the bad. Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness. Who is that cheering, who is that dancing in passionate abandon? We'll do a warrior-dance in the beautiful forest. It's him, my friend who is leading the team. It's true, so true. He came to keep us company. Look at the earth, it's earth that sprouts gold. It's where our forefathers shed their blood. Take all the good and reject the bad. Let our granaries be filled with joy and happiness. Bow your heads to the Prince of Chirakkal! Vavvali! Kings don't demand obeisance. Only the arrogant do that. Allah! My father said: 'Never bow down to a tyrant'. Friend! This is not a gift for the palace. Tear the skin off his back with my whip. Dearest! Please don't be foolish! This is the king, the best of men, he who safeguards us with... gold and grain. May he reign on his throne forever. The King feared the prediction that there was danger if his son succeeded him, not his daughter. The King had only one true friend: Chenicheri Kurup. A scholar in 12 languages and a trusted ally of the Portuguese. Of all the ministers Vasco took back home... only he was sent back alive. But, there were the reasons for these goods! The Chirakkal goods are excellent. Are you trying to deceive us? What did the new traders who came from Ceylon and Bengal give you? I know all the people who give your Sultan Ismail bad advice. Did you come here to do honest trade or show off? You have to show us the same loyalty as you show Arackal... Then our reigning King will give you a worthy prize. Your policy is excellent, Chenicheri. But I think you talk a little too much. I cannot imagine bowing our heads before the Arabs or the Chinese. They need us. The value for pepper is 1200 times more in the Persian market. Let the Arab go if he wants... There's Italy, Spain, Germany, France... We can send ships there directly and trade with them. Spain, Italy! Indeed! They said they'd give us a trade permit, so that our ships will be safe. The Arackal people have got a permit, thanks to their minister. Why blame the Portuguese? The Portuguese has never withheld anything they promised us. Oh yes, they'll give it all. I saw what they gave us. Thanks to our minister's inefficiency all Kolathunad got was trash! - I know what I should do. - So do I. Here, betel leaves. Allah! Walk on! These are the men who trapped our people at the temple. My men captured them at Puthur. I've brought back the corpses of the men we killed. See this, Father? You seem to grow bluer in colour as you grow up. My ancestors built a bridge to welcome Gama. Now he dares to send a weapon to kill my daughter! War is waged only from 6 to 6. It's wrong to have broken that rule. King! It can't be the Portuguese who sent someone to kill the girl. It must be Baliahasan from Arackal. What? Arackal attacking our princess? Don't waste time thinking drown them in wild waters or throw them in hot oil. No! Better still, let elephants trample them to death! Bring the tusker! What a scary sound! It's our punishment for stealing the elephant's food. A single kick must finish off the fellow who attacked our princess. Now don't you remember any words your father used to say? The women of the palace do not come to the audience hall. Is it the custom to punish those, who protect us? Bhanu is clever, he brought these arrogant men before the King. What stupidity! If it wasn't for these men this fire-spitter would have blown open my heart! Instead of punishing them you must honour them as warriors, teacher! Ignorant Bhanu! You've scattered our pride. Where's that dog? -King. Untie these men. Free them! I'll never forget what you did for us today. Rice that smells of blood! Where did you complete your studies? My father gave me weapons, taught me how to use them. Karikathiyamma taught me speed. I learnt how to write at Karumalayil and... strategies of war at many centres. Only this fellow and his mother gave me food. I learnt war fight from Mangadu, Vannalacheri, Vepur & Dharmapatnam teachers. A King in central Kerala taught me warfare. A Fakir in the south who became my teacher... sent me to finish my training at the famous centre in Valor. Who is your enemy? He, who says one thing with his eyes and cheats with his hands. If you want my enemy's name, it has always been the man who destroyed my clan. As I grow, he grows bigger, taking over the whole country. Bravo! A handful of Portuguese came, asking for pepper. Their starved bodies were clad in tatters. Now they dry their underwear on the tip of my sword use my throne as a step-stool and spit orders at me! Let's not stay here too long. It's not a good place. Tomorrow, to witness the hanging of Baliahasan... the Viceroy will come in a ship named after St. Katrina... Vasco da Gama, after 22 years! That hanging must not take place. The Portuguese who wanted to kill my daughter must know that there are brave men in Kolathunad. I want Gama at my feet. You have the ability to do it. Will you? No! So you've got Chenicheri to give these dogs a feast. Good, Father. This fellow's an obscenity that I forgot halfway. Gama's ready to enter the Arackal Fort. Will you bring him to me? Father used to say, if he who holds his head high is formally invited to take part in war, it is right and just that he accepts Arackal will make mincemeat out of us. You can't buy me! I'll do it because I want to! I'll bring Vasco here from Arackal. Vasco is the lord of the Indian Ocean, greatest of the great! You're not even fit to stand before the Viceroy. Stop bragging, dog! Prince! I'll honour my word even before the sand in the hourglass drips 40 times. If the manhood under your waist cloth has even the power of a lizard's tail... clean up the obscenity under the King's tongue. Or if you're man enough, come with me. I'll show you what male loyalty means as for calling me dog... this fellow and I have only one caste, the caste of 'war'. And only one class, that of a soldier. I ate a handful of rice from here. I give you my word in return 5 of my best soldiers will go with you... so will my prayers. First Bhima... then Yudhishtira. Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva. A back-up force will follow you. No harm must come to the Viceroy. The Muslim, Ali, and Kelu Nayanar must not come back to Chirakkal Kelu! So you're going to Arackal to avenge me...? No... yes. Look at this. The Serpent blessed Virgin! The Serpent comes alive at night when you return, I'll show you where it sleeps. The roof is leaning to one side. There's a mother inside who'll never fall, whatever happens. She'll have food ready for us, no matter what time we walk in. You go first. Why do you want to stay outside? Half of what she gives will be yours. Okay. Whatever it's bad or good I'll accept it with pleasure. Even if she's not the one who bore me, she's my mother too. Mother! What a surprise! Is no one looking after her? Cooking all the time! Mother! Is the food ready? Bring your women to live here. Then you can ask her to cook it's 40 days since we've had anything fit to eat. Lies! He ate the King's food and gave him a promise. I've brought him back like I said I would. He's taken money to gather an army for war. Look, out there. The big warriors of the palace. When I was a child, you took a throne out of my hand once and healed my hand. But the Portuguese pierced my heart with a throne... when I was 8 years old. That wound has not healed for 20 years. At last, that cruel Vasco is coming back... to supervise the hanging of Arackal Baliahasan. From the age of 8, I've been carrying this pain and now a release! I'm going, Mother, to put an end to him. Give me your blessing. All I have to give you is Ali as dear to me as you are. Take him. So you don't want me, Mother? Allah! A fort like a Turkish ship Minister Mammaly Marikar made it invincible. I've heard there's an opening in the northern wall. By the time we get there, Baliahasan would have been hanged and a tree would have sprouted from his grave. Then, shall we return? There's only one way to get there, to reach the viceroy. The Arackal Fort capable of withstanding 12 years of war fears only.. The 101 cannons pointed from Fort St. Angelo. We've come here readily gathering our force. We don't bother even if anybody dies. -Hey! Stop! Where do you people go? Our Andi brother has died getting burnt. So...? I should watch Baliahasan's execution... That was this expired man's final wish. Not his wish. Don't bring his curse upon you. Thanks a lot, sir. We've come here readily gathering our force. We got in. Now how do we get out? Who's that? Ayesha. Arakkal Ayesha. Only one person at Arakkal did not... bow her head before the Portuguese to punish her... the Portuguese dragged Ayesha to an island. She killed 9 of the 10 men who came to molest her... and left one alive to tell her tale. People celebrated her name: Arakkal Ayesha. Is this the time to sing, sister? Baliahasan guarded our honour... While the noose tightens around his neck, you sing! Great! Come quickly, Beevi's calling you. Come on! I sent for you, Ayesha to tell you that you should not go out. I know you'll dare me and go. The Portuguese haven't forgotten what you did Harabichi Beevi. You were dancing in the Arab's tent when I first saw you. I was 10 years old then. Then, when you came to Arackal with my Father... I put henna on your hands and welcomed you. Those hands lit the lamp on Father's grave. Those hands now wave at the Portuguese inviting them to your house. They clap to applaud Baliahasan's hanging. Aren't you ashamed to say you're a woman of Arackal? And to call yourself a wife? Harabichi. Stop your sarcasm! If I shut my mouth will a 100 canons stop spitting fire at us? Did we not offer them as much gold as they wanted in return for Baliahasan's life? They're scaring us. Even our children are afraid. Every woman here, every germ of life within her, is afraid. We should not allow that. What will we do now? I'll draw a moustache on you! In our holy book our religion has fixed certain punishments for all, who commit atrocities. Nobody can get excuse from those punishments even if they are our brothers. I, Asim Marikar, spoke to Baliahasan, but he wouldn't listen. He sank ships and killed the Portuguese, our well-wishers. To carry out his death sentence... the great viceroy Vasco da Gama's Son, Estavio has sailed to Kannur. Estavio da Cama executes his punishment... on behalf of Dhuwan emperor & Vasco da Gama. Bring Baliahasan. There's Baliahasan. Friend. Will you ask his pardon? If you ask publicly for pardon... l will appeal to these people, in Allah's name... to make your death a peaceful one. I will ask pardon. He says he will ask pardon. Untie this knot. You are stronger, you have more men and weapons than us. And still, you're afraid. I ask your pardon because I have let the Portuguese live. I still haven't killed them all. There are Baliahasans in this crowd. Bolo Takbir! Allahu Akbar! My friend. Rem ember your promise. You said you'd take him back alive. Let's not make him a corpse. How dare you stab me from behind! All the men Chenicheri sent with us are traitors. Don't wait for them. Come. There's something happening here that we don't know about. Those who came with us have some other aim. Shut your mouth! If he dies, his corpse won't walk. You'll have to carry it yourself say your prayers if you want to. Don't open your mouth for anything else. So you'll take this man to Chirakkal and keep your word. Is the King of Chirakkal your grandfather? If we send this coppery head to Vasco, it would be a good message. If we keep the son, the father will follow. Don't kill him. Kelu is used to doing what he wants. Listen to me. The women and children in our village must see him alive and take revenge on him. Your fervour's good! But we have to cross this forest. I know my way from Makkam Thara. Till then, we have to manage. There's seldom even a wick here. Today, someone's lighted a lamp. Anyway we're not lost. Come. We'll have to tie a rope around his neck and drag him. That girl said she'd be waiting for you with a wedding chain... if you go back with this burden. Isn't that why you came with me? What? You're saying I'm in love with that haughty girl? I'll dash a stone at his head like I'd break coconuts in the temple! If you think my words are worthless, go your way, I'm not coming. What am I without you? There's no need for weapons in a place of worship. Who are you? I came from the land of the Aryans in a wooden ship, King. He's no King, he's my friend. Now Chirakkal trusts you and Arackal respects you. Go to Chirakkal. You will become commanders of their army. How? The friend who's with you is good and grateful. Protect the country and the forest. Don't let the Portuguese take over. Movement! Movement through the world's expanse. There'll be a promise that life will shine like a full moon. Movement! Movement through the world's expanse. There'll be a promise that life will shine like a full moon. In the end, dreams will come true. Movement! Movement through the world's expanse. There'll be a promise that life will shine like a full moon. In the end, dreams will come true. Listen to the call that sleeps within your heart. There's a right way out for everything that happens. Let us search for it. Go that way brave warriors! Each life follows a different destiny. And we can still change what we are saddled with we can make dreams our weapons... Let us achieve, O brave warriors! Wake up and find your path... Cleanse and sharpen your minds. Learn the speed of chariots and be armed with your glowing dreams. Movement! Movement through the world's expanse. There'll be a promise that life will shine like a full moon. In the end, dreams will come true. Listen to the call that sleeps within your heart. There's a right way out for everything that happens. Let us search for it. Go that way, O warriors! We can make dreams our weapons... We'll see and achieve then, O brave warriors! O brave warriors! All will come true. A girl with the scent of pepper! Is she real, or was it a dream? It's clear we'll reach Chirakkal Vavvali, you'll be an army chief! And you'll be King?! Will I have to bow down to you? Friend! Isn't that what she told you? All these dreams! Come, Let's go. Listen, you Portuguese fellow! My Kelu's the King! Look! A foreigner! The man with a gun from Portugal. The man with coppery hair. Shut up your mouth. The six-footer who crossed the seven seas to come here. Our King's gouged out the lies in his grey eyes. What a man he is, our King! Is this Gama? I've seen him. He has a beard. Who's this? This is Gama, Estavio Gama. The Viceroy's son. -He's Estappan. The Estappan who gave us nightmares, talking endlessly about pepper and trade permits. Let me look at your face. This is Gama's seal. If it's his son, let's announce him as our special guest and start negotiations with Cochin. Bring the ceremonial sword. A man of your word! You're my Commander from now on King! Chirakkal's new Kothuval. Now Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar. May the Goddess be with you. Chirakkal Kothuval offers you this on the tip of his sword. This copper-head's little finger. This will be our message to viceroy Gama at Cochin. Though his skin is white, his blood is red. Send it with this ring. Our gift to Gama. Slice up what's left. Why kill this man? Let him make the Portuguese guns for Chirakkal. Good. Bandage his wound. It was wise to let Estappan live. He'll be bait for the big fish! I was wondering which of them sent those men to betray us. Now I'm sure it wasn't the King. Betel leaves! Here's a sight for the king's eyes. Arab women. The half-caste converts born in Chirakkal Unnichirutha's clan. She was stolen from our pond. They're from the women's quarters of Arackal... the family that tried to shoot our Princess. It was Maundy Thursday, the Viceroy went to Cochin. The Portuguese fought until the Arackal Fort was ashes. These women were fleeing to Tellicherry. I brought them here. Well done, Kaimal! Did you give some of them away to your friends? Ah, she looks like a carving of our grandmother, Unnichirutha! Who is she? Ayesha! Arakkal Ayesha! I've heard of her. The granddaughter of Asma Beebi. The jewel of Arackal. Shouldn't we welcome her into the family, Chenicheri'? She's a lioness. We must give her a seat. Yes, we must make her 'sit'! But I don't see a suitable chair... The left thigh for the Queen and the right for the daughter. Isn't that what they say? Come, dear! Come and sit down. Touch one Chirakkal woman and it will burn 100 Arackal women. Good customs and courtesies. My gratitude for the mercy shown to the Arackal women. By right, I should be Queen here. But where's my place? On the uncle's thigh or in the nephew's chamber? Clever girl! This clan honours the custom of a girl choosing her husband. Tell the women inside to clean her up. Be a Prince at least in your bedroom. Mesmerize her. Prepare a special bedroom for the army commanders. Nayanar, you're back from the war. Take a silk mattress if you want one. Is he gone? Come, Ali. Do you like scented chambers and silk mattresses? You want this one, or this one or. Whether the war is at Arackal or Chirakkal, it's the women who suffer. Chenicheri told me specially to look after you. The missing finger still seems to be there. You've lost a lot of blood. Don't move. The news reached Gama at Cochin. Viceroy there's fighting at Arackal... Baliahasan was not hanged. Estavio fell into enemy hands. Vasco had overcome many obstacles in his life. He was confident of his son's return. He won't say he can't do it. When you're tired of the games... in the bedroom, come out. I'll be waiting. I won't sleep. Was that girl your younger sister? You could have brought her in here. Call her now, before your life snuffs out! Day will not break tomorrow for any man here. Pull her away! Don't kill the girl. She's beautiful. We should send her to the brothel at Mannanar. Don't, she'll enjoy it there. Throw her to the public, they'll tame her. Bhanu, all you ever get are leftovers. That's your fate. Don't touch me! Never come back to this cursed land. Go! Go and survive somewhere. Get up, it's time to go. Where? I dreamt we were bringing my mother here. I didn't set out just to enjoy being an army chief. I know. We must capture Vasco. But that's not so easy. We have the bait here. We'll take his son with us. You have a horse now. Stay on here as chief of the army and you'll have a hundred. Be intelligent. Stay here. To bow to the King and manage his affairs? To overcome a pirate, a trader's brain is better than a hunter's. To do the right thing at the right. Time is my way.. Come if you want to. We must break open the prison and take him. How? Came to take a skirt you forgot? I told you to go away. Where can I go? Wherever there's place, wherever you like. I like these people. They're all I have left. See what they've done to her, that imbecile, your Prince. He destroyed her. Young or old, you don't care? Cruel wretches! Shouldn't have left a single man in this palace alive. Her reasons, our livelihoods: They're different things. You can never forgive those who hurt women or children, Vavvali. So you've decided I won't live to see my next birthday. I must mend the harm I did without meaning to. You must create a diversion now. A screen that will cover the eyes of the guards. Follow me without making a sound. Estappan! Estappan's opened the door and come out! Catch him! Aim the target person by your right hand, twist your right hand towards left... Join both the right & left hands... Twist your head, sit properly & hold your hands tightly.. Strike him strongly. Lord Allah! That's all. You're a skilled duelist. Estappan freed the Arackal women and killed the guards. He was coming to kill you. Where's your companion? He's gone to Madayi. That's how Estappan had his chance. I never fail to reward those who prove their worth. You will supervise my guard from now on. Bring the sword of honour! Estappan must be shifted to Bhanu's custody. The Muslims will attack once their Women go back. We may have many army heads. But the king has only one head. Chenicheri. So, you've been given a sword. There's tooth-powder in the house. Use as much as you like. Throw down your broomstick. I've brought some women. How did you cross the river at this time? I swam. The Goddess held my hand. They're women from Arackal. The little one's been mauled. Look after them. Let them stay here till their people come. If they want to go, let them go. Your fury hasn't abated? Don't imagine you've done something great. I can't express gratitude that I do not feel. You're still furious? That Prince's head must be chopped off. Arakkal Ayesha, who hacked nine Portuguese men in pieces to save her honour. If it's true that you've brought me, to a good place, give me a weapon to protect the women, who came along, trusting me. I was given a Chirakkal sword and I'm an army chief now. Everything the girl said is coming true. Where are the women? At Puthur. Let them stay there for some time. I asked the Headman to make sure, no one sees them. Where's Estavio? I knocked him down. Chenicheri had him confined to Bhanu's room. It's a mistake to have let him out of our hands. No, it's Allah's mercy. The enemy you seek the viceroy will come here to get him. Until then, you please stay here. Where is it? The Urumi-sword is not at your Waist. Did it fall off somewhere? Or did you fall? It will never lose its way. It will come back to me. So you gave it away to a girl you've just met! You've never allowed me to touch it even once. Did you give her only the sword or your heart as well? This is a problem. Friend, it's a problem. What's the problem? I said, what's the problem? What problem does my new army chief have? This is another problem! I have eyes that gleam that ignite sparks each time, they flutter. I have the beauty and grace of the flowering poovarasu tree. When he sees me walk like the graceful swan... the theyyam god will abandon his crown. Look at my beauty, like a silver cup that's full to the brim. I have eyes that gleam that ignite sparks each time, they flutter. I have the beauty and grace of the flowering poovarasu tree. When he sees me walk like the graceful swan... the theyyam god will abandon his crown. Look at my beauty, like a silver cup that's full to the brim. The elite of Kolathunad will covet me when they see me... and all the women at home will tease me. The fragrance of my jasmine will intoxicate the men of the Samoodiri's palace. The clouds will come running to line my eyes with kajal. While the Pooram festival was grandly celebrated... While you did the war dance, you didn't look at me. Still you are my I have eyes that gleam that ignite sparks each time, they flutter. I have the beauty and grace of the flowering poovarasu tree. When he sees me walk like the graceful swan... the theyyam god will abandon his crown. Look at my beauty, like a silver cup that's full to the brim. You are like the bow of Kamadeva, the God of Love. Don't swing your sword at me. I will become a flower. All the girls in the queen's bathing ghat will find out about us. Those who guard our land will conduct our wedding. I sang about so many things spoke without words and yet you said nothing. Still, you are my I have eyes that gleam that ignite sparks each time, they flutter. I have the beauty and grace of the flowering poovarasu tree. When he sees me walk like the graceful swan... the theyyam god will abandon his crown. Look at my beauty, like a silver cup that's full to the brim. Sit here. For his brain to work, he must eat. Give him food. He wants to know if you're trying to kill him. He's suspicious. Trust us. I just cut him down to size in Portuguese. Bhanu, these people love to eat. If they go to Melindi or Mombasa, they enjoy chameleons, lizards. They kill everyone, eat anything. That's their way. Does he understand our language? He doesn't seem to. But all those who came here after his father spoke fluent Malayalam. I think he follows it. Shall we find out? How? This is his last meal. Velutha, hang him when he's done. He understands Malayalam perfectly. You're a poor actor. Don't try to fool me. When the new regime in your country became intolerable, I was one of those who requested Vasco da Gama to come back to Kerala. And now he likes Unniraman of Cochin more than me. I will save you, Estavio. In return, you must make this prince, Bhanuvikraman, an important man. And Vasco must come here himself. What did he say? To free him. That's dangerous. Let the time come. Estavio I'll do what is necessary then. This prince is your friend. 'Bastard' means he who does not have a father. This sword refuses to surrender to my hands. It's not used to being handled by strangers. Disobedience is something I prefer to subdue. This is not just a whiplash. It's time for the journey. You burnt our house. Now you're sending me back? Stop this two-faced game. I'll take over as guard. You're the reason my home turned to ashes. I didn't come there to kill Arab women. The father will gather an army and come for his son. That's exactly what I'm waiting for. The mercenaries of Chirakkal can't defeat his army. I did not hope for an army when I set out on this hunt. You're not confronting just one man, the Viceroy. War is something to win not to fear. Put aside your arrogance. I've no army, I've only my word to give you. Am ass strength. Go to the villages, gather those who have fire within them. Ayesha is with you as well. There are people in the Arackal army who are loyal to me. Why give me help I did not seek? I am also with Kothuval's son on his journey. Where do you go with your force? Not with my force. To Madai along with my friend. I'm going to start a good matter punishing Payanbai & meeting Madai soldiers. Ifs very tough. You always roaming with your friend. Friendi's words are right. If we don't say anything to them, whom shouldn't we say.. We need not hear the unwanted suggestions. I wanted to tell you a thing. What's that? He's my friend from my childhood. He's like dragonfly, which dies immediately if we harm it. Whoever may say anything. He will be honest. I'll be there with him. I am also there with you. Can you take me also to your destination? Queen should go along with the king. Flight? -Will you become a king, right? - Princess. King is on the way. Don't torture us by singing here. King will be there only if there is his kingdom. Flight? Friend has planned to gather some people & question you directly I'll come from my journey & tell you that when you'd come with me. Keezha Nayanar! -You man! Keezha Nayanar didn't go to Puthur cowardly & not to hide somewhere. To ask credit. -King has gone for that only. Right? He will definitely arrange it. Why did you ask credit for us, Nayanar? We will give you the crops alone of Madha Nayakar. You man! Shout louder! Let our people come here. Come on! Come on! We didn't come here to ask money. To ask man power for our force. We have a great force to redeem our Kozhikodu from our enemies. We have our warriors to destroy our enemies. I saw my siblings suffer for they want to kill me... Puthur soldiers couldn't help me. When they killed Thalachangodu dragging his hair... Nobody supported us getting bribe from your king. Then they ceased our group. Somebody laughed louder at that time. Some other people died in prison. Why? To cross our seas, we need permits. Why should we? When we send people to ask they come back as corpses. This is becoming a routine in every part. So Kelu has come to ask for a favour. The Portuguese have nearly 1000 people and we here have 5 men for each one of them. I was born on this soil. I ask this soil to loan me its men. Doesn't he know that if you don't obey the Portuguese, they'll hang you? True, I sing for wages, but I get enough to eat and be happy. Come with me, all of you who are strong and brave. Give me a 1000 hands to go to war with the Portuguese. We don't need this hang-pole that pierces our Mother earth's chest. History must never say that this animal was a burden to me. Go on drawing. Hold me, I'm coming down. My back. These people are from Kodungallur... Syrians who are suffering because they opposed the Portuguese. They'd be glad if you give them an opportunity to do trade with us. Madhevos, Yusuf. If you help us, King, We will always remember you. What's the point of remembering? If we get a discount on taxes, we'll bring you your share of the profits. Shouldn't I have a word with Chenicheri? No King should seek another's help if he feels he's doing the right thing. Go and see the officials. Thank you, King. There's something I have to tell you. The person who broke open the cell to free the Arackal women was me. Kelu! They are safe now, at Puthur. That was wrong, King. You must make amends for your mistake. The people at Arackal are our enemies, Kelu. -Our prestige -What prestige? For banishing your sister because a Muslim touched her during a quarrel about the partition of the property? Or for your fear that Cheraman Perumal would... hand your entire land over to Islam? Enough of that. Christians, Muslims, must all stand with us now. The Arackal girl. We've already spoken about it. Don't touch the ground. Carefully, attentively... Imagine he's a wild boar that has come to destroy your crops. A wild boar. Betel leaves. You seem overcome by emotion. Yes, it's emotion. The emotion of joy. Once I realized that kingship is not easy I never enjoyed peace of mind. Now that I have two strong young men to look after my affairs, is a satisfaction. Now I feel that I'm a King. When the scaffolds the Portuguese had put up were uprooted the fear in people's hearts came out with them. They had a leader now to unite them, Kelu. Your pupils are pale, your eyes have a reddish tinge. By the time you're King, you'll be blind, like Dhritarashtra. Who is Dhritarashtra? The King of the Kauravas. I do everything the King tells me, and yet. That's why I say, the way forward is the Portuguese way. I have received bad news from Puther Kelu... and Ali are running around, gathering people. They want to amass a huge army. Their aim is to attain the Chirakkal throne. I what should I do? The throne...is not a low-legged bed. You must use the imprisoned Estavio to get to Vasco da Gama... and I then climb up through Vasco to the position of King. This time, the gift was your son's little finger. Next time you send the army they'll send his head. Asim is coming in the guise of a Muslim devotee. Vasco is sending troops to rescue Estappan. Those pigs will come and eat your crops. Vasco knew that if he himself led the army that would endanger his son. So, he sent trusted Portuguese warriors... to rescue Estavio, his son along with some local warriors. Did you hear the village army sing a funeral dirge? Go and tell them that the ritual of uprooting has started a folk song. Mother! Won't our suffers go off? Our excitements & our happiness... Do you know about our peaceful life & delicious cooking, you girl? Dear! Do you know those things, you girl? Who are you? Like the thundering waves... Like flying embers... You come like the fiery ethira' dancer. The one who holds within him the completeness of the arts. Those closely entwined tresses have so much grace and beauty. What lies in those eyes, where waves splash, is it lust or compassion? Is it a dream or a tender shoot? Is it fire or words? Will you not tell me? Who are you? Like the thundering waves... Like flying embers... You come like the fiery ethira' dancer. The one who holds within him the completeness of the arts. In the night-dark flow of your wet tresses... you wear a crescent moon. In the unleashed blade of the urumi-sword... you are the gleam of gold. In the Ezhimala hills and the Elamala hills... You unfurl a peacock that merges into my dream. You become the body of an un-quenched thirst. Who are you? From the body which is getting spoiled... To the devil sailor named Vasco, who is going to die... Kelu & his country people expected Vasco's death. It's time for action. Ali and Kelu have overcome the King. Your father, Vasco da Gama, is sitting idle in Cochin. I'm sending the Crown Prince himself to Vasco with the news. 'Vao' in Portuguese means 'Go' in Malayalam! A message from Kolathunad, for the first time after the riots. A dwarf...? What Chenicheri said was right. Your every word is foolish. Chirakkal Bhanuvikraman. Sit down. He's not yet become King. He's the Crown Prince. You look the part. It wouldn't be wrong to call you King. Gama is on the warpath. He caught a fever in Goa and has become very weak. And he's worried about his son. Who thought this would happen? Estavio Chenicheri Kurup is very clever. He didn't come himself because he knew he'd never go back. I'll explain things to this fellow. I'll tell him what to do and how to do it. Tell him, why you've come. The trade permit trade permit. Trade permit? Yes. There's a person outside. You can go. Your father will never touch Opium again. Good! The Goddess's face will become clear again. There'll soon be a wedding chain around your neck. You'll make me hate this world? So you want to retire, do you? I have a warrior in mind. Go and put on these new clothes. When you come back wearing them, I'll tell you who it is. I have someone in mind too. Only clothes - no jewels? Off with you! Why didn't you tell me you were going on a journey? Danger lurks everywhere now. Look at this. For 4 years, you've been begging the Portuguese for a trade permit. I managed to get it in just 4 days! What do you have to say now? Who has the right to levy taxes on the God-given expanse of the sea? Whose feet did you fall at? Stuff it back in the throat of whoever gave it to you. See that your index finger does not tremble. Chenicheri... Those eyes... Chenicheri, close those eyes. We'd not allow European force to cross our country... Estappan has escaped. And the King Estavio has escaped. Now Gama will come with his arm y. The late King would have given orders to prepare for war. Tell the chieftains. The Chirakkal army will do take orders from me. They will not be with you. You, your army and Kurup who feeds you Opium. Do what you want? You dare talk back to the King? Sit down on that throne, Bhanu. First teach him the basics of monarchy before he plays the King's role. You want to fight the Portuguese? That is real treason. You want poor folk who are used to tilling the land to fight the Portuguese army. You're selfish! Your duty to a King is to protect his people, not shed their blood. There's a scheming, greedy woman in you. Authority over the Lakshadweep Islands and a title. That's the bait the Portuguese hold against you. My father once asked you to support him and fight for our people. You handed him over to the Portuguese instead... My father, Chirakkal Kothuval you betrayed him. Kothuval! If it was only my self-interest, then your head would have been on my lap. Open your eyes. There's only one enemy. 22 years ago, my father ignited a spark in my heart, with which. I swore to light a pyre for the Viceroy Estavio. Princess! The moment you chose to open my door was not auspicious. The King is gone. I have only one thing to say without pomp or ceremony, you must come out of this sad room now. Our country needs its Princess. I can feel my father's agony. Before his pyre turns to ashes the army will reach the palace. Don't be foolish and allow their guns to come up to this door. Knowingly don't be a witness to the wrongs. I know who killed my father and why... I cringe that the blood that flows in his veins is the same as mine... Yes, I will leave this palace without pomp or ceremony I will leave this palace that will bow down to the Portuguese... and come to your village. I will be with you, Princess, wherever you go. From now on, that's all I want to dedicate myself to Puthur is your palace now. We didn't have the time, Princess, to prepare a welcome for you. I have not left home. I have come home. We'll surround them at the spot where the viceroy arrives. Look, a 100 people are digging the moat. Get the women and children ready to go north to the mountains. Here, a letter. The King will know who sent it and what to do. As always, the woman retreats. No, you will lead them. You will safeguard the mothers who will give us a whole new generation of warriors. Why did you choose me for this mission? If I know you are there, far away, I will come back just for you. We have fresh garlands for the new stage. And the scene is set for us. We hold our love for this soil close to our hearts. And in the abode we've made, no one is a stranger. Our souls and our lives are linked to our dreams... this is what the wise ones have always taught us. There are many changes, Viceroy. Temples have become taverns. Enough spaces have been created... for the Portuguese cannons to be placed. Pepper traders compete in every port as for that garrulous King... we did away with him. Rather, Bhanu helped. Here he is, the King. All that this Minister, Kurup wishes for is the affection of Portugal. Affection... Estappan, my friend. News as Dhuwan, the new king of Portugal, has saved his promise. Minister Kuruppu is the Government General of lakh islands hereafter. Your contract of dividing the tax amount of ships those comes for all the directions... Hey Chakrathali Hasim Pakir! You've become a great man as this Chenacheli Kuruppan's broad-mind. If I get this reward now... I have the intelligence to think whether I can go to lakh islands or prison. Kuruppu is going to give up his role that he played until now. I have 2 eyes, which wants to redeem my country from European forces. I won't get this reward to spoil that. Estavio! I'm a prestigious person. Don't prevent anyone from leaving. People have gathered at the appointed spots. Before the war starts, talk to them to give them courage. We've talked enough. Now for deeds. The Chirakkal army is approaching. So Kaimal, no one with you when you switched sides? Have you seen the deep pit in which to bury men like you? Standing shoulder to shoulder, you gave of your best your weapons in tune with your hearts. Now, to the palace. Friend! Vavvali, my friend. Vavvali, it's nothing. Vavvali, nothing's happened to you. Friend! Nothing... Close your mouth. Move... -Move. -Be careful. Nothing, Vavvali. Go, my friend. Achieve what you dared. Tomorrow, no one will remember Vavvali. Maybe no one will praise Kelu. But give me your word that the world will never glorify Vasco. No, no. You are my brother and protector. Before I cut his throat, you should come. I'll wait for you. Viceroy! The village army has come. What Ali said became true. History forgot Kelu and the world praised Vasco. Other countries followed the Portuguese 400 years of servitude... until a Gandhi liberated us. The spaces of war have shifted. It's here now. We stand before the weapon that is money. The decision is yours to make and the responsibility of this as well. There's drumming in the north while we dance in the south... Friend! These people are harmless, nothing like what we feared. It was along and tiring journey. What's the evening programme? A meeting with the landowner, Krishnadas... and Nirvana, the mining corporation. Sir, if you plant one tree, will it become a forest? All the trees I planted till now have become forests. Sir, considering the debates on mining in Orissa what's your personal opinion about this enterprise in Kerala? You're asking whether I have shares in the company, Nirvana. No, I don't. It is an international consortium. Blood! Be positive, it's a good omen. Sign. This project will be located on a vast portion of land that is being sold willingly by Krishnadas with your support this will become one of India's best mining cities. I have to think about it again. I said, I have to give it some more thought. Satellite cities, opportunities for employment. IT parks. The media must understand that I am not against environmental issues. I am against fake environmental activists. I cannot sell. Brother! I had no sentiments at all for the soil I was born on until I arrived here. I came here, met some people and heard of the dream that those who lived and died on this soil had. That dream is now mine as well, I want to try once more... and see if we can make that dream come true. Be careful, that's an urumi-sword. If I know you are there, far away, I will come back, just for you.
