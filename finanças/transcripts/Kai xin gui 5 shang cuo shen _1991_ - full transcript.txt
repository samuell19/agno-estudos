Yummy (Wasabi) Hey, buddy, someone invites you to sing. Are you interested? Can you sing'? Jack! Water at last! You really are something! I'm something at least I'm not a dog. Not like him! How do you know I'm a dog? Don't call yourself a dog. Anyone who jumps into bed with someone elsefls girlfriend is a dog! He is a dog! What did you say? Sir... Sir... Are you alright? Come on, let's go. Are you hurt? Howl hate him! You're becoming drunk, too much cognac! I hate him. You tell me, what's she got that I haven't got? You're a nicer girl. And a lot cuter. Then why won't he tell the bitch to go? I'll get you some water. Vodka I want cognac! Drink this water You lie to me, I hate people who lie. I didn't really lie. I just twisted the truth. The truth is I'm your dog. D09 I know, you're an old dog? I'm your dog! I like dog, dog is faithful. Kathy ... Suppertime, guys! Come & eat! I'm so hungry! Here it is, dinner delicious ... See this! It's fun being together, I love being a human. I'm so hHPPY- I feel happy fOF Yo"- Me too. I jealous you. I envy you. What do you think. I don't think it'll workout. Human are nothing but trouble. I don't speak dog, what's going on? Bring me some chicken tomorrow. Happy Ghost, can you help me please? Magic, how many times have I said it. Impossible to be a dog again before your time. But I don't want to be a dog. I want to stay like this. Well, now that's even more difficult. Reincarnation-wise, you're pretty low down the ladder. Not long out of the plant kingdom, so don't push your luck here. Even in your next life. You won't be human, you got a lew more dog lives yet. You're very lucky you'd these 49 days. Don't upset the Gods, or you may return as a grasshopper. But that feeling I've with my mistress. The warmth & wonderfulness. It's not like being with your average bitch at all. It's reserved for the human kingdom, only human beings can have feelings like that. They say I love you. Love you? Other than making money, Love motivates human to do anything, The trouble is ... People just treat love & money in the same way. Think they can own love. When in fact it's a gift to give. Many live, spent working that one out. But why? Just believe it. You try & control love. & you'll live to regret it. Come back, it's not true. I want love. I want love! I really like it here. I'm sorry sir, you're not allowed to bring your dog in here. I can't go in. What's the matter with you? You're not a dog. That's right, I'm not a dog. Let's go in. Magic, would you like a hot dog? A dog? I can't eat a dog! Not a dog, a hot dog. It doesn't matter if it's hot or cold. I just don't eat it. Two hot dogs please. Eat up! It's sausage, there's no dog. I promise you that Be careful with love. So what happened'? Thought I saw something Well, why don't we go to a movie? Piss off, go on! Be careful with love. What is it? It's a scarey movie. Did she scare you with her body? No love! No love! No love! No love! Let's go. No love my friend. Do you know why I asked you over for dinner? Today's my birthday. I'm sorry but I don't have a present. But wait till next payday. Happy birthday Excuse me. Hello? Happy birthday Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Jack, I'm not alone. Be careful in love. No love. You mustn't fall in love with her. Now what? Nothing, just spilled my drink, I'll just go clean up. Remember, you'll live to regret it if you love her. Come here. You made me human, how come you won't let me love? You've only got 7 more days left. Don't wreck it by falling in love. I want to stay human not a dog. But you can't change your destiny as a dog now. Listen, it's not the same thing, a man is not a dog. I don't care about that, I've got 7 days left to be a lover And I'm going to use them. But it isn't worth it. It won't work really, cause you aren't a man. You're only man's best friend. Kathy still loves Jack. And Jack loves her too. How you know it? I've watched their diaries They're perfect couple. You'd be responsible for this mess. Let do a good job before you leave. Match them as a merit for yourself. Kathy we need to talk, I want to thank you. For making me happy, in my new life. I understand. It must be very hard in Mainland China. I'm glad you came to HK. I want to say ... Jack loves you, you can't just leave him. Forgive him. What are you talking about? Lucy means nothing at all to him. I'm sure of that! How do you know'? I saw it with my own eyes. Saw it with your own eyes'? I'm really your dog Magic. I see, you've met someone new. Do you have a wife in China, is that it? If you don't want to be my friend. Just say so, you don't have to show up with such excuses. I really am your dog Magic. I can prove it. I know so much about you. What do you know about? That earring you're wearing was a present years ago from your mom. You mist aid it, I found it for you there in the rubbish. And I know about that watch, it's a present from Jack on Valentines Day. But... You stop it. You read my diary! Do you have no sense of privacy? I didn't do it. Get out! Open the door! I didn't read it, I swear to you. Hi hunky, you've been thrown out again? No wonder you call yourself a dog. The 2 of you make a perfect couple. You've ruined everything. In the end you'll thank me. It's better this way. Never mind, come to my place.
