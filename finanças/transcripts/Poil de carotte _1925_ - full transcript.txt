CARROT TOP A drama in five parts from the book by Jules RENARD Directed by Julien Duvivier In a small provincial town. Mrs. Lepic, gossipmonger, hypocritical, spiteful. Mr. Lepic, indifferent, egoistic. She gathered the town gossips together once a week to let her tongue wag freely. "They just can't keep their mouths shut, those cursed magpies!" "Are you going out again, my dear?" "You don't like it when I have people over!" "To think that I've put up with that boor for twenty years!" "Can you tell me where the Lepic family lives?" "My name is Annette. I'm the new maid." "With Mrs. Lepic, life won't be easy." "But Mr. Lepic is a good man. I know him quite well." "If you're honest and hardworking, you'll get along with him." "This is Felix, my favorite son." "But I don't see any pictures of the youngest boy? "Carrot Top? He's a lying, thieving, stupid redhead!" At the local county school. Francois, the Lepics' youngest son, came into the world when the dissension between his parents was a fait accompli. COMPOSITION Your thoughts about the family. The family is a group of people living under the same roof who cannot stand each other. In a so-called artistic cabaret in town. Felix, the Lepics' oldest son, spent most of his evenings in this place. "Your schoolboy admirer has arrived." Maria Milon, a realist singer. By the time the holidays came around Felix had succeeded in softening pretty Maria's heart. "Will you come join me? Promise me!" "You promised, don't forget!" An intimate family scene. Ernestine, the sister of Felix and Francois. "Felix, my son, help yourself." "There's no more melon for you. Anyway, you're like me, you don't like it." "Can't you answer when you're spoken to?" "I've told you never to talk with your mouth full!" "Could you pass me some bread to finish off my compote?" "Stop meddling, will you? Just do your job, that's all that's asked of you!" The next day. "Whose turn is it to go hunting with me?" "Hey, you hens! I'm going hunting!" "Felix! Dad's taking me hunting with him!" "Fighting with Felix again! Leave him alone!" "Go get me some cream from the farm." "Mom, please... Let me go hunting with dad..." "Do as I say!" "Are you ready? Let's go!" "After thinking about it, I'd rather stay here." "Another one of your whims! You're as fickle as the wind! Stay here then, my friend, and whine all you like!" "Why do I act like that? To avoid getting a thrashing and since dad thrashes less..." You're so far away, not being able to see you, I can't bear it anymore. Come, Felix. Maria, who was only interested in Felix as a source of money, sought out information on the Lepics' wealth. Felix Lepic is the oldest son. The Lepics are well-off. A small, but secure fortune. "Annette, have you put the hens in the henhouse?" "Go close up the henhouse! "It's dark, I'm scared!" "I'm not a coward... I was just pretending to be scared!" "You were scared, weren't you?" "Carrot Top, you'll close up the henhouse every evening." "Please, God... I don't want to go to the henhouse again tomorrow night." "Where's the chamber pot..." "What in heaven's name have I done to deserve such a child!" "There was no pot in the room. I'm sure there wasn't... She just put it in there now." "There wasn't any pot here last night... I promise!" The next day, while Mr. Lepic was in town. "It's my day off. Come, I'll take you for a stroll." "No one will ever love me like that!" "No one loves me. Everyone rejects me." Mathilde, Carrot Top's little girlfriend. "Why doesn't your family like you?" "My mother says it's because I'm so ugly." In the train that was bringing Mr. Lepic back home. Pretty Maria was coming to see Felix. "I forbid him to play at getting married to my little Mathilde." "Why did you go off with Annette without my permission?" Seeing her husband, Mrs. Lepic changes her attitude. "Who do you like better, your father or your mother?" "I like mommy better." "Go away, Annette... It would be better if I were dead." "Not everyone can be an orphan." "I should never have come. You don't love me!" "I'm dying of boredom here, I'm going to leave tonight." "The person who truly loves me would take me to Paris." "To run away, we need money. Wait a little longer and I'll get some." Felix's sister, Ernestine, happened to come upon this scene. "I won't say anything if you give me money." "Mr. Lepic, your son is treated unfairly. He's unhappy." "No, Carrot Top. Mrs. Lepic is always going after him." "If you want to get on Mrs. Lepic's good side, say bad things about me." "I know my father isn't happy... but he doesn't want anyone to know." "And Mrs. Lepic doesn't like me because I take pity on him." "Carrot Top! It's always Carrot Top!" "I can't take it, no other boy could be as unhappy as me." "What are you doing here, Carrot Top?" "You know... I'm going to kill myself." The next day, a delegation came to ask Mr. Lepic to run for mayor. "Please be our candidate for mayor!" Then he thought about his little friends. "Where is Carrot Top? Have you seen him?" "You've completely lost your mind! You stupid boy!" "My son, Francois. "My little Carrot Top..." "My little Carrot Top, go feed the dog." "It's your turn to work, you go feed the dog." "Mom, don't cry... I'll go feed the dog." Meanwhile, the way Felix was acting with Maria was scandalizing everyone around. "The Lepics' son..." "This small change is hardly enough to keep me here with you." "Just wait, I'll get the money we need." "Someone stole another 100 francs from me today." "You're the one who stole it!" "Oh, Madame! Francois would never do that!" "Stay out of this, I didn't ask you!" "Did you see him? Are you sure?" "I think so..." "He who starts by stealing an egg!" "Will steal an ox!" "And finally end up in prison!" "Leave the boy alone!" "I told you to leave the boy alone!" "That's enough!" On Sunday, the next day, Mr. Lepic's election fell on the same day as the village fair. The barn... A beam... A rope... "The train doesn't leave for another two hours.Let's go to the fair!" The barn... A beam... A rope... A beam... A rope... "We'll never get married, Mathilde, because I'm going to kill myself." To distract Carrot Top from carrying out his plan, Mathilde had Annette take her to the fair. "Gentlemen, I declare my three ideals to you: unity - equality - morality." "Rather than look after the town's business, you should look after your own!" "What do you mean? You'd better tell me!" "Are you saying you don't know your wife ill-treats your youngest son?" "I say that your son Felix is scandalizing the town!" "A girl, of the worst sort!" "What is Francois doing?" "He's going to kill himself." "Where is Felix?" "Naturally, you accuse Felix!" "Goodbye, old Dick!" "What have you done with the money! Thief!" "I didn't take anything, and I can go out with anyone I want!" "You! You'd better keep out of this!" "Madame, the boy is going to harm himself." "Sir, Carrot Top is trying to kill himself!" His life... His pathetic life still held him back... "What were you doing?" "Go ahead, cry, my boy... Tears will do you good." "Why did you want to die?" "I have a mother... who doesn't love me and I don't love her." "What about me, do you think I love her?" "Be quiet... After all, she is your mother." "My poor little boy..." "You came into the world too late, against your mother's will. She never forgave you." "From now on, no one will hurt you anymore." "Now, the two of us are together." THE END
