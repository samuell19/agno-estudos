Father, there's a fire on the island two points off the starboard bow. Stop that, James. Just tell us where it is. To your right, mother, to your right. Oh, my, yes! Stand by. We're going to land. Grab some branches! Put it out with the branches! Be careful, children. Don't get too close. Put your backs into it, and we'll save those trees. A motley brigade if I ever saw one. To the staff and crew of the vireo, well done! Now for a swim! Oh, Franklin! Let's make it quick! I don't know if I can even make it. Now, Franklin, the children have had along day, so don't overdo the swimming. In their condition, water is the best thing for them. Last one into the water is a tadpole! How many feet? Oh. Oh, another one? I feel like a coatrack. Well? You look like last year's Christmas tree! - Oh, really, frank. - Father! Come on! Last one in the lagoon is a rotten egg! Thank you, Edward. Please tell Mrs. Macgowan that we'll have supper at half past six. Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt. Slowpokes! Slowpokes! Hurry up! I'm going to beat you! I'm going to win! Oh, no, you're not! Franklin! Johnny! Franklin! Johnny! Mrs. Macgowan says she needs all this from welchpool. Well, we'll pick everything up tomorrow, Edward. Oh, and some pipe tobacco for Mr. Roosevelt. Mother, I don't know why you picked Julius Caesar for us to read tonight. All the good parts are for men. Well, you and I will double up in all the parts, like the others I'd like to read Brutus. Your father makes the final decisions on casting. Uh, please tell Mrs. Macgowan that we're going sailing and picnicking again tomorrow, and I'll talk to her later about the lunch. Oh, mother... We would all appreciate it if we could have something other than fried chicken and hard-boiled eggs. Then tomorrow perhaps we'll try fried eggs and hard-boiled chicken. Ahoy! Home is the sailor! Hurry up, Duffy, hurry up. Hurry up, Duffy. Eleanor, with that megaphone, they could hear you clean across to eastport. Last again, the runt! Don't call me a runt! I'm Johnny! You tell her, Sonny! Ah, there you are, my friend Johnny. Marie, I don't want to go upstairs! - Yes, you do. - Father... Johnny, il faut t'habiller pour diner. UN moment, s'il vous plait. Papa, comment vas tu? Ga va bien. Come on, I'll make your journey upstairs a pleasant one. Giddyap, Giddyap! Giddyap, Giddyap, Giddyap... Bet you can't do that with me. Father, why do we have to read Julius Caesar for tonight? I'm not sure I like Shakespeare at all. You're a noisy group of illiterates. - I just combed it! - Let's get on him! Very well, I'll take on the four of you! Uhh! Get him! Get his legs! Oh! The boys are so loud and noisy! Mother, how you put up with the four of them, I don't know. The four boys are easy. It's the one girl. Do you think I'm difficult? I think you feel surrounded by the men in the family. Before granny went to Europe, she told me she thinks you're too severe with me. I'm well aware of granny's opinions. Actually, granny spoils us. The boys can talk her out of anything they want. All they have to do is speak a little French or... or agree with her. What about you? Of course, so can I. So can you what? I heard you say, "so can I." Oh, talk granny out of anything I want, just like the boys, especially if I agree with her when she says something about Mr. Howe. Oh, father, is Mr. Howe coming back here? No, he's going to be tied up in Washington. Jimmy, why do you ask? Nothing. "Why do you ask? Nothing"? What kind of English is that? Why do you ask? For no reason. That's better. But you had a reason, Jimmy. I want you to tell us. Well, it's just that usually he rooms next to me, and all that... that coughing and... Wheezing he does keeps me up at night. And when he burns the incense to stop the coughing... Well, that's worse than anything. You never appear to be suffering from lack of sleep. Father, I'm serious. Jimmy, I'm serious, too. I want no criticism of, or complaints about, Mr. Louis Howe, from you or anyone else. Is that understood? Understood. Uh, granny always says that Mr. Howe... I know all about granny's opinions of Mr. Howe, and I don't want them repeated by you. And I would appreciate it if you and Jimmy would do a little rehearsing for tonight's reading. Franklin, you should get into some dry clothes. I want to catch up on the mail. Babs, how about a hard drink? I feel a little tired. That's the first swim I've had in years that didn't refresh me. You should be more careful. Eleanor, I am not catching another cold, and I am not becoming an alcoholic. I just want you to get out of that wet suit. In a few minutes. Mother, about Mr. Howe, Anna and I would like... Your father closed the discussion some minutes ago. Go on with your reading. Well, like they say, we struck out. It's a pleasure to open a paper and see my name out of it. This is a tidy item, six million people unemployed, and president Harding is playing his tuba. Thanks, babs. Ah, good. That'll take the chill out of my bones. I often think of something Woodrow Wilson said to me, "it is only once in a generation that a people can be lifted above material things. That is why conservative government is in the saddle for two-thirds of the time." Louis insists that you can reverse the trend. Yes, after having wet-nursed my public relations for some 10 years, he doesn't like my staying on in this wall street job. He says it's hardly a place for a dedicated progressive. Well, Franklin, is it? Babs, it's 500 a week. And confidentially, Mrs. R., the light on my political horizon appears rather dim and dark. You know, there's nothing so unattractive to a party as a defeated candidate. I hardly think that you will be held responsible for the defeat of the Democratic party. After all, Cox was the presidential candidate, not you. Babs, I have weathered battles with Tammany hall, seven years in the Navy department, and mama's massive objections to politics, which she rates one step higher than garbage-collecting. So I feel sure wall street will not corrupt my political convictions. That's a comfort. But if I get into deep water, keep your eye on me, babs. God takes man into deep water not to drown him, but to cleanse him. Helpful hint from helpful wife. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you kindly. Hey, ma, we're hungry! Only a few moments now. From mama. From granny. What does granny say? Father, we have just got to decide about who is going to read what. Well, as you know, we must all play a variety of roles. However, tonight's main assignment shall be as follows. Your mother will read calpurnia. Anna, you shall read Portia, Cinna the poet, and Octavius. Jimmy, you shall be Brutus. I've been studying Antony. I shall read Marc Antony. You are Brutus. Elliott, you should make a fine Cassius. And Franklin, you have the round look of casca. And, Johnny, Johnny, you shall be the mobs, the citizens, and the sounds of battle. And Marie, Marie, you shall be Julius Caesar. Merci. Probably my greatest stroke of casting. What's in granny's letter? Well, let's see. Granny has moved to London to visit cousin Muriel, whose slight operation apparently was successful, though mama doesn't think highly of British medicine. She doesn't approve of Muriel's bed, too hard. She says my bed's too soft. Granny believes in hard beds for men, soft beds for women. Ah-ha! She may sail on the 24th, which would get her home the 31st, or maybe a week later, which would get her here September seventh. She may stay. She loves the hotel. Quote, "much love to the precious children. I expect to find a French family on my return." "Devotedly, mama." Unquote. Ici, on par/e frangais. Dinner is ready, Mrs. Roosevelt. What has Mrs. Macgowan got for dinner tonight? Let life surprise you, Elliott. It's more fun that way. Please, Franklin, get into some dry clothes for dinner. This time of day is always the best. It's as if the sun were... standing still for a last glimpse... Along, lingering look... Before saying good night. It's a nice... quiet time. I wish I could stay till after labor da... Why, Franklin! Must be a spot of lumbago. No, I don't feel feverish, just suddenly... Why don't you get into bed and I'll bring you a tray? No, thanks, it's all right. I'll be down in a minute. Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? Mrs. Macgowan, Mrs. Macgowan, Mrs. Macgowan! Yay! Eleanor. Coming, darling, coming. Franklin! What's happened? I got up for a moment... And couldn't make it back. Something's happened to my legs. And I seem to have what an old upstater would call "the trembles." Let's get you to bed. Ohh! Ahh! Mighty cold for August, babs. I'll get you a hot-water bottle. Allez, Allez! Mother! I do wish you'd give me the right to decide what time we're to have lunch. The boys want to begin eating before we've even started. Yes, dear, I give you complete authority, but I suggest you use Marie as your assistant. Thank you, mother. Well... how's the patient today? Mr. Howe, I'd say he's about the same. What do we do about changing things for the better? Uh, I got in touch with a specialist at bar harbor. He doesn't think there's any reason for him to come back at this time. He still maintains that it's a clot on the spinal cord. Advises continued massage and the same medication. But it doesn't seem to be doing much good. The paralysis seems to be spreading. I know. But it's only been a few days. We just have to keep on doing what we've been told. Well, I'll be back early this evening, Mrs. Roosevelt. Still can't find a nurse? Mr. Howe, as you know, we've few of them here. They're all mighty busy with the influenza epidemic. Well, we'll manage, Dr. Bennet, I'm certain. You've been doing wonderfully. - Thank you, Dr. Bennet. - Oh, yes. May as well get back to it. Louis... I'm glad you came. I... I'd have felt lost without you. And a good, good morning to you, Mr. Howe. You're looking your usual dyspeptic self. None of your amiable chatter, please. Leave it. In a couple of days, I'm sure I'll be able to lift it. Oh, I'm delighted! And aren't you the clever one? Would you like to make a bet? Just get over this and get back to New York. I hate the great outdoors. I hope, uh, you don't object to my rather informal attire during these ministrations. I tried on a nurse's uniform, and while the skirt was rather flattering, I don't look well in white. Louis... What about your... new job in Washington? Well, mein Herr, it was for me, not so good. So I quit. Quit? When? When you heard that I needed a... masseur? One of your less appealing qualities is your tendency to be garrulous. Bobbleobby! You give me my candy back! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Edward. Ladies. Good afternoon. Mrs. Roosevelt, how's the skipper today? About the same, thank you. We expect another doctor tomorrow. If we can do anything, just ask. Thank you, captain. Have you got everything, Edward? Yes, ma'am. The call was from uncle Fred. He talked to Dr. Lovett in Boston. The doctor is almost positive... That it's... infantile paralysis. Infantile paralysis?! What about the kids? Dr. Lovett explained that as they'd already been exposed, there was no necessity to move them. We're not to say anything until Dr. Lovett has examined Franklin tomorrow. He'll be here in the morning. We're to discontinue massage. And, um... Franklin's mother will be back from Europe on September the first. That gives us 10 days to get Franklin on his feet again. We better. She'll never forgive us. Oh, how good to see you, Mrs. Roosevelt. Hello, miss le hand. And how is my son? I just arrived yesterday, but Mrs. Roosevelt told me that there has been a little change for the better. Thank god. And the children? Oh, they're all fine. They're being kept away from the house as much as possible. And where is Eleanor? - She and Mr. Howe are with Mr. Roosevelt. - Oh. You must have had a tiring journey. I haven't thought about it. I want to see my son. Well, in this case, the top becomes the bottom. Good morning. Mama! - Eleanor. - Dear mama. Franklin. My boy... my dear boy. Mama, travel agrees with you. - You look absolutely marvelous. - Oh, well... I don't know what you're doing in bed, Franklin. You look pretty well yourself. Welcome home, mama. Eleanor, dear. Hello, Mrs. Roosevelt. Mr. Howe. Well, it was a comfort to hear the sound of laughter coming from this room. Well, Louis insisted on telling us one of his... quite risqué stories. It was unprintable, but... It was quite funny. I'm afraid I never developed an appetite for that kind of humor. Mama, if you'd Grant yourself the luxury of listening to a couple of those stories, you'd understand. This one was about the two traveling salesmen who... Please, please, Franklin, there are so many other things I'd rather hear about. First, tell me about your trip home. Well, it was a beautiful liner. The staterooms are magnificently decorated. The cuisine is typically French, quality of the sauce, rich, quality of the beef, poor. So many of the passengers were dreary... Hello, Jimmy. Anything wrong? Nothing, Mr. Howe. Why aren't you asleep? I couldn't sleep. How's father? Oh, having a fairly good night. When can I see him? Couple of days. What's on your mind? Well, you know, the... The kids are a little scared. Mm-hmm. And you? Well, naturally, I get a little worried myself sometimes. But your father doesn't. And he wouldn't want you to. I'd feel better if I knew what was going on! But I don't want to bother mother. No. She's had enough to do for the past three weeks. And stop being frightened. Those germs never ran into anyone as tough as your father. They'll be... They'll be yelling for help by the time he's through with them. He's strong, all right. He's a strong, big man in many ways. Jimmy... When I first got here, I was worried about your father being so sick. But now he's beginning to fight back. And when he fights-... You know, I first saw your father in Albany in 1911. He was fighting a tough battle with Tammany hall, and those fellows can fight like roughnecks. He won that one going away, like what Dempsey did to carpentier. Jimmy... He's going to win this one. I hope you're right. Never been wrong in my life! Jimmy? I just got up for a glass of milk, mother. Oh, all right, dear. Now, go in now and get some sleep. Mother... You'd better get some rest, too. Good night. Good night, James. Good night, Mr. Howe. Good night, Jimmy. Eleanor, why the devil can't we get some electric light in here? Oh, Louis, you know we can't. Oh. This is the forest primeval. Well, you can have it. No electric light, no telephone, newspapers two days late. What's really bothering you, Louis? Where's Mrs. Roosevelt? She'll probably be down in a few minutes. Please, Louis, be understanding. This has been a desperately unhappy day for her. And I think she's behaved... wonderfully. I am understanding, Eleanor. I like the old lady. She fascinates me. Monumental and impregnable, like the rock of Gibraltar. I know your problems with mama. Oh, no problems. She just hates the sight of me. Please, Louis, don't quarrel with her. Eleanor, I promise to shinny on my side if she'll shinny on hers. Eleanor? Yes, mama? Is Franklin asleep? Yes. He's been resting for over two hours. Has the pain eased? A cup of tea, mama? I would like that. I won't be a moment. Kettle's on. - Louis? - No, thank you. How are you feeling, Mrs. Roosevelt? A little tired, but a good night's rest will pick me up, I'm sure. How is your wife, Mr. Howe? Thank you. Grace is fine. The air is rather stuffy, don't you think? Well, we had the door open for a while, but it's damn cold outside. Do the doctors know when Franklin can be taken back to New York? They hope in a couple of weeks. I must compliment you and Eleanor, the way you are behaving. Mrs. Roosevelt, you caught on to the spirit of things very well. Eleanor, dear, I hope you're not too worn out, because this is the first opportunity we've had to talk. Yes, mama. Mrs. Roosevelt, this girl has worked like a whole squad of trained nurses. Dr. Lovett was amazed that she's been able to do it all. And what... does Dr. Lovett think? He believes it to be a mild attack and feels that Franklin will recover almost completely. Well, mama, at first, Franklin lost control... Even of his hands. He couldn't write... or hold a spoon. Now his arms and hands are almost all well. We... we don't... know yet about his back... Or his legs. He... he can't... sit up? No, deal not yet. But the doctors feel sure that his back muscles will be all right. His legs... those wonderful legs... What about them? The doctors don't know. It's too much. I can't believe it. Mama, perhaps we shouldn't talk any more. - You're exhausted. - Oh, no. No, I couldn't sleep right now. The children... I can certainly help with the children. That would be wonderful, mama. Eleanor, you've got to get some rest. We all do. I think I'll turn in. Uh, excuse me. Good night, Mr. Howe. Good night. Rest well, Louis. Good night. I don't know why the hell they can't put some electric lights in here! He's a vulgar little man. He's a very dear little man. I find him very difficult. You make that quite clear. I'm not skillful at hiding my true feelings, Eleanor. That may not be a virtue, mama. There's something very, very special in the relationship between Louis and Franklin. I've never quite understood it. It is possible that Mr. Howe merely enjoys riding along on Franklin's coattails. Eleanor... Franklin needs you for a minute. Eleanor... Uh, it's nothing alarming, Mrs. Roosevelt. You suffer a great deal from asthma, don't you? A great deal. I'd be lonesome without it. You know that smoking isn't very good for it. You know that? I do. What are the plans for Franklin after he's taken to New York? Well, first, he goes to the hospital for treatments, and then, I suppose it depends on how all that goes. And you say he'll be able to be moved in two or three weeks? We hope so. As soon as Franklin is able to leave the hospital, I want him to go to Hyde park. Everything he loves is there. It's home to him. It always has been. It's large enough for the entire family. And that's where he can be made most comfortable. Well... I'm sure that as soon as Franklin is well enough, that he and Eleanor will decide where he wants to recuperate. If Franklin has any permanent injury, the best place for him is Hyde park. Why, we can make a full life for him there. He can write, take care of the estate, rear his family as he was reared. There'll be enough to keep him active without overtaxing him or spending his energy. Mrs. Roosevelt, I've heard Franklin say that in public service, a man must be prepared to spend and be spent. He may not be willing to accept a sedentary life in the country. Mr. Howe, you now must do everything possible to discourage him from trying to remain in politics. Permanent injury or not, Hyde park or Timbuktu, - Franklin's political future is ordained. - Oh! Yes, I... I know that... That sounds mystical, but I feel it as surely as I feel my heart beating. Believe me, Mr. Howe, I respect your devotion, but Franklin is more to me than a prospective candidate for public office. He's my son. He is also Eleanor's husband, the father of five children, and my dearest friend. My only interest is in his getting well, not in his status as a politician. - Mrs. Roosevelt... - I am grateful for the care and devotion you have given Franklin. I will be less grateful for your untimely and grandiose schemes. Mrs. Roosevelt, for the next few months, Franklin may have need of... "Grandiose" schemes. So may we all! Good night, Mr. Howe. Please let me! - Here. - Good morning, Edward. - Good morning, sir. - Hiya, Johnny. We're all being very quiet, Mr. Howe, aren't we? That's right. He's a cute one. Yeah, they're all cute. But there's sure a hell of a lot of them. We've got about one hour in which to catch that train. This is going to be a rough trip for Mr. R. Well, after we get him across the bay and into eastport, the rough time is over. Those newspapermen are liable to scalp you. Yes, you've got them waiting on one dock, and you're going to move Mr. R onto the other one. Well, after I get him onto the train, all propped up, I'll explain to the brethren that there was a sudden change in plans due to the tides or currents or something. When do you tell them the boss has infantile? Later, after we get him to New York, sometime tomorrow. Here. "After thorough examinations, doctors today revealed that Franklin Delano Roosevelt suffered from a mild attack of infantile paralysis. His legs are temporarily affected, but it is anticipated that he will make a complete recovery." Come on, Missy. I'm all ears. Louis, I've been here for two weeks now, trying to act like he does, as if nothing's the matter. It seems like a sad and foolish game. - Missy... - I'm sorry, but he keeps rattling on about plans for business conferences and meetings, overhauling the Democratic party, selecting candidates for '22 and '24, organizes this charity and reorganizes that. I listen in wonder... And I want to cry. Maybe he doesn't mean one word of what he's planning or trying to do. But he wants us to believe it. So, Missy... believe! Well, Franklin, you owe me a dollar. You're still above normal. Merely the... physical exertion of the last few minutes. Doctor... I plan to leave here today if I have to crawl down to the bay and swim across to eastport and crawl onto that train. I didn't say anything about you not leaving. Eleanor, give him this powder. Getting over to eastport, he's going to have a lot more pain than he's willing to admit. Franklin... Are you sure you can manage this trip? I'm going to make a damn good try, babs. Now, right in here, up those stairs. Mrs. Roosevelt. - We better move. - Captain Skinner. Good morning, Mrs. Roosevelt. Good morning. Are the children all ready, miss le hand? Yes, they're outside. I don't think they should see their father carried out on a stretcher. That may be unavoidable. Missy, here are some additional get-well letters. I've had no time to answer them. A small wonder. Did Edward get the cigarettes for Mr. Roosevelt? - Yes. - And is mademoiselle with the children? On the dock. Eleanor, I do not believe that the children should see Franklin carried out on that stretcher. They may have to learn to see a lot of things, mama. Well, perhaps, but it may be a shock, particularly to the younger ones. They'll get older. Mr. Howe! I... didn't mean that the way it sounded, but I think Eleanor is right. Then I believe you and I have varying opinions of what is right and wrong. Well, frankly, I suppose the children are excited by it. They'd probably love to be carried to a boat on a stretcher. Furthermore, Franklin's departure should not be handled like a circus. Mama, Franklin is a man of some reputation. His day of departure could have been kept secret. No, it couldn't! My god, Mrs. Roosevelt, the press have been eyeing Campobello since the day Franklin took ill. I do not approve of his being placed on exhibition! Mama! This is not a pleasant day for any of us, particularly for Franklin. Now, lift this end, Charlie. Keep it level. Right, that's it. Lower that end a little. Now, over the post. Men, it's a lot easier going down than up. Be grateful for small favors. Easy does it, now. Set it right down here, boys. That's it. Easy. We're going to take a little rest. Thank you, gentlemen. The journey was a pleasant one. Where's my missis? Here I am, darling. How about a look around, doc? Yes, indeed. I tell you, there's no other way to travel. Thanks, Louis, my boy. How have you planned the logistics? Well, first, the children, Missy, your mother, take off for the main dock. That's where the sightseers and the press will congregate. A goodly crowd is gathered and awaits eagerly. But, mein Herr, while all the peoples is watching the one boat coming on the water, we go away by the other boat for eastport und get on the train. Gut, nicht wahr? Aha, a diversionary tactic. Precisely, mein Herr. As assistant secretary of the Navy, - I used to rate a 17-gun salute. - Ach. Have you arranged for that? You're just an ex-assistant. No guns. You're lucky we've got water. Louis, I approve of your plan. I've been waiting breathlessly. He's not fooling. Louis's first love was the theater, loves applause. All right. I... I hate to break up the party, but boat number one ought to be on the way. Oh, that's me. Bon voyage, mama. Bon voyage. See you, boss. Right. Here we go, Franklin. Boys... Easy does it, now. By gosh, I feel like the caliph of Baghdad. Come here, you old pirate. Edward, here are all the keys. Yes, ma'am. I'll lock up and see that everything is shipshape. All right, thank you. There we go. That's right. Goodbye, Mr. Roosevelt, and the best of luck to you, sir. Thank you, Edward. - All right? - All right. Hurry up, gentlemen, we have a train to catch. Good morning, Mrs. Roosevelt! Where's your son? I don't know anything about it, gentlemen! You must kindly talk to miss le hand. - Well, hello, miss le hand. - Where's your boss? Gentlemen, gentlemen, apparently, there's been some misunderstanding and Mr. Roosevelt's boat has gone directly to the railroad station. Quickly please, gentlemen. Where's Mr. Roosevelt?! There's been a misunderstanding. Why didn't you tell us they were coming here?! Oh, Marie, keep the children in their rooms until we leave. Madame, ils sont tellement decidés, ils sont impossible! Marie, gardez ies enfants dans ie compartment jusqu'a notre depart. Je réponds bien, madame. Faites ies! Oui. Oui, madame. Eleanor, where's my good hat? It's here. How do I look, snappy? Never better. You don't need it now. Sea air does always make me sleepy. Hello, Mrs. Roosevelt. - Good afternoon, Franklin. - Jimmy! What a surprise! I'm so glad to see you, father. How wonderful to see you. How's school? - Well... - Oh, I had some good news today. I'm going to be out of here before the new year. Franklin! Is he making that up? Oh, no. Both Dr. Draper and Dr. Lovett believe he'll be able to do that. Let me show you how strong I am. Franklin! Nothing to it. Well, that's darn good! If I wanted to show off, I could do it 20 times. - Oh... - Oh, my. Babs, here are the sketches for adapting one of the kitchen chairs into a wheelchair. I don't want any of those conventional invalid chairs. Well, James, tell me about groton. How do you like Dr. Peabody? Well, sir, I'd say he's a rather strong personality. Ooh! Oh, father! I'd say you were a strong personality, too! Thank you, Charles. Sorry to interrupt, boss, but you wanted to get these off. In the letter to the park commissioner, I may have made a mistake. I couldn't remember if you said 60,000 trees - or 16. - Sixteen. Good, that's what I typed in. My enunciation is usually precise enough to make the distinction between 16 and 60. No criticism, Mr. R. My hearing must be failing. You'll have to correct this. It's “pinehenge farm," not "pinhenge." Missy, this rough draft of the letter to Cordell hull should be triple-spaced. I'm having a good day. Well, if you must know, - I'm having a perfectly wretched day. - I'm sorry. I can't wear the leg braces because they don't fit. And I don't know why I'm going all the way to Boston to get new ones that also won't fit. And I'm fed up with all these friendly hints that come in the mail. Everything from ancient nostrums to brand-new gadgets invented by people all the way from Keokuk to Zanzibar. They all want to help, not hurt. Oh, Missy, stop it! No sweetness and light today! Please. Here, take them away! Franklin, I talked with Regan, and he's arranged for the railroad trip to Boston. I may not go to Boston. Well, you don't have to go until Friday. You can decide by then. There's a nice, cheery letter from Jimmy... And one from Woodrow Wilson. Well, I'm glad to read Jimmy anticipates good marks. That's a relief. He loves groton. I'm sure groton's relieved, too. It's an extremely considerate note. "I am indeed delighted to hear you are getting so well and so confidently, and I shall try and be generous enough not to envy you. I hope that your generous labors on behalf of the Wilson foundation have not overtaxed you, and you are certainly to be congratulated on your successful leadership in the complicated and difficult undertaking." That's really quite thoughtful of him. You have done a lot for the foundation. Only because I believe in it. Either we develop some plan for world peace and order, or the world will chop itself into bits. Excuse me, boss, may I get on with the rest of these? On your way, Missy. Later, I want to do another draft of that letter to Cordell hull. What I've got is too obscure. Sixteen. I was apologizing for having lost my temper. I had a rather tense chore a few minutes ago. I had to let the upstairs maid go. She complained so much about all the work she had to do, most of which she never did anyway. Sorry, babs. You've had a big turnover on maids this year. It's been a busy household. It's been a nice household. I'm getting expert with this chair. Moves easily. - Hm. - See that? This exercise is stimulating. Takes some of the loneliness away. Loneliness, dear? Invalidism, even temporary, is very lonely. I remember reading, "a sick man wishes to be where he is not." When you're forced to sit a lot and watch others move about, you feel apart, lonely, because you can't get up and pace around, too. I find myself irritated when people come in here and parade all over the place. I have to keep exercising self-control to prevent screaming at them to sit down, quiet down, stand still. I'll remember. You're quiet... and restful. I'm just tired. Where's Louis? He said he was going out for a feel of the pulse of the city. What he really means, he's going out to get the newspapers. Loves the teapot dome stories. Adores political scandals... If they embarrass Republicans. Franklin, are there other things I should know that you haven't told me? You mean like about Louis going out to get the papers? I mean about your... your loneliness. Often, when you're alone, certain fears seek you out and hunt for a place in your mind. Well, you know, I've always had a small fear about fire. Since this, I've sometimes nightmares about being trapped and unable to move. I've been practicing crawling so I could be sure, in case of fire, I could get to a window by myself, or to a door, or a flight of steps. I didn't know you'd been... crawling. I've been trying. And I can do fairly well. But soon I'll be back on my feet. The back muscles came 'round, so will the legs. Of course they will. You like her? She's lovely. She'll really sail, you know. She's not just a toy. I miss the sea. Eleanor, I must say this... Once... to someone. Those first few days at Campobello, when this started... I had despair... Deep, sick despair. It was a sense that perhaps I'd never get up again, like a crab laying on its back. I'd look down at my fingers and exert every thought to get them to move. I'd send down orders to my legs and toes. They didn't obey. Darling! I turned to my faith, babs, for strength to endure. I feel I must go through this fire for some reason. Eleanor, it's a hard way to learn humility, but I've been learning... by crawling. I know what's meant, "you must learn to crawl before you can walk." Mother? Mother? Mother! Mother! I'm in here, Anna. - And... and do be quiet. - How are you, father? Mother, I have to talk to you, it's important. Some other time, dear. - I do have important... - This chamber is yours. Au revoir. Franklin... I have some work to do, babs. See you later, sis. Franklin... Mother, I want to talk to you. Yes, dear, so you told me. I can't talk to you on the run! Now, Anna, you cannot make up all the rules. I'm listening. It's about my room. What about your room? I cannot understand why I've been moved upstairs into a little cubbyhole, and Mr. Howe has been given my large room. Well, that change was made weeks ago. Why has it taken you so long to question it? Because I... I accepted the change without thinking of it. Oh, you did? Yes. But just the other day, when granny was here, she asked me the question direct, and I couldn't give her a clear answer. Then I suggest that you tell granny to ask me. Mother it seems to me that I'm being... It seems to me, Anna, that you're behaving badly. - I feel... - Hello, ladies! Shall I recount the happenings on the appian way? Mother, please! Anna, I will not discuss this with you now. I'm sorry. I'll see you later, Eleanor. There's no need! Mother and I have concluded our conversation, thank you! Excuse me, please! Marie Antoinette couldn't have been more noble on her way to the guillotine. It's a busy house, Louis, a very busy house. It's a busy world. Here's an item I want you to see. The Chicago tribune, "the New York Democratic party considers Franklin d. Roosevelt number-one choice for governor." Oh, Louis, those items that you manage to squeeze into the newspapers make good reading, but they're pointless. They're good for his morale... and mine. Your morale looks as though it'd been hit by a mack truck! I have, on occasion, felt far cheerier. You're probably scared stiff about that speech you have to read. That's what's wearing you down. Oh, Louis, I'd be no good at it. I can't lecture. I giggle at the wrong times and I... I can't control my voice. When I think I'm... I'm whispering, I'm shouting. Eleanor... this work has to be done. You are, for a time, Franklin's eyes, ears, and legs. You must go places he can't go. I'm certain I'd be awful. You are in the hands of professor Howe, wizard of the spoken word, speechless mummies given the eloquence of Demosthenes. Eleanor, you don't have to make anything up. Just read it. I don't like to read a speech. Do you think the Gettysburg address was ad-lib? Louis... I'll try. Leave it at that. Aha! The pulse-taker. And the pulse is good. From Maine to California, the nation still endures under Harding and teapot dome is boiling. That's a good theme for your speech, Eleanor. My poor, tiring Eleanor, being driven into the wilds of the political jungle. The only place that I'm being driven to is the kitchen. And now, my friend, we have work to do. I have here a list of your various clubs, organizations, federations, fraternities, unions, societies, associations, and groups. You and I are going through this list and do a job of editing. What exactly have you in mind? The doctors say you're doing too much. I'm merely their obedient servant. Let me see the list. You've crossed off almost every organization in which I'm genuinely interested. Franklin, you've too many interests. You've got to cut down. I will not discontinue my work with the boy scouts. Their aims are damned important. What the devil are you working for, scout master? I'll decide what goes and what doesn't. All right, Franklin. All right. I'll give you the boy scouts, but something else has got to go. There's a big breeze blowing and you've got to trim sail. The congressional elections are coming up. You've got to keep your hand in. I won't be able to move about too much for a while. But we can write. We can let people know that a man named Franklin d. Roosevelt has opinions... ideas... And convictions. All right, we can get rid of some of those. Mr. Brimmer is here. Who's Mr. Brimmer? It's a deal I've been working on. - Another one? Oh, Franklin. - Show him in. Missy, who is this brimmer? The boss'll tell you. Is this another of your imaginative business deals? Louis, stop heckling me. Just sit... quietly. I know how you dislike my pacing around. Good day, Mr. Roosevelt. How are you feeling? Coming along. Mr. Brimmer, Mr. Howe. Mr. Howe, it's a pleasure. I've had a long day, Mr. Brimmer. I have the full picture ready for presentation, beginning with the estimates on the construction of the four dirigibles, as you requested. Dirigibles?! Go ahead, Mr. Brimmer. The cost of construction, as you will see, will be cheaper if they're built in Germany. Airports and masts could be constructed in suitable locations in Chicago and New York for a daily service at comparatively low cost. Also included on this chart, here, is the amount of helium gas needed, the cost, the construction, items for storage tanks, et cetera, et cetera. Also listed, the approximate cost of personnel needed to run the ships on a daily basis. The airport crews, ticket agencies, And an advertising allotment based on minimal efforts until the service catches the public's fancy. I-It'll catch on. I agree. Absolutely, I agree. Uh, charted for you are various hours suggested for best air time in connection with commuter trains, auto traffic, and accessibility. Also, ideas for campaigns, all to be studied, digested, assimilated, and collated. Louis! Why the hell are you always moving around?! I'm nervous. Mr. Brimmer, leave all this here for me. I'll study it in detail and be in touch with you. - We're prepared to seek underwriting. - We can talk of that later. Thank you, Mr. Brimmer. I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. Of course. I... I understand. I'll leave these estimates here. Mr. Howe... it's been a great pleasure. Thank you, sir. And good day to you, Mr. Roosevelt. Goodbye, Mr. Brimmer. Why the devil didn't someone answer the phone? I don't know. I also don't know about dirigibles. What is this scheme? A damn practical one. Between New York and Chicago? For a starter. We can build this into a transcontinental line, eventually nonstop, coast-to-coast. - Oh, Franklin... - Don't wet-blanket this, Louis. It could mean a fortune. And I am sorry I yelled. Brimmer was driving me mad, prowling back and forth like an awkward tiger. With a little helium, I'll bet he could get to Chicago. Louis is a monster! Madam, your husband is about to go into the lighter-than-air business, which proves he has a lighter-than-air head. Caution, my friend, is the refuge of cowards. Well, your refuge is bed. You must rest before dinner. Very well. Today, I am going upstairs... On my ow“... Without helium. This is something I have been planning for quite a few days. Franklin, perhaps you... No, now's the time. I can crawl... and I'm going to prove it. Some other time... Stand back, Louis. This method of locomotion I shall call the Roosevelt slide. Half waltz... Half fox trot. Easy on the feet, placing all the wear and tear on the derriere. Well, Eleanor? Good? Wonderful, darling. Wonderful. See you later. And how would you like it if granny gave you a nice little tea party? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy, will you read us the end of yesterday's stories? You promised. Well, let Marie take you to wash up and then come back and I'll keep my promise. My hands are dirty. Oh, no, dear. A gentleman's hands may be soiled, but never dirty. Oh, Franklin isn't in his study. No, mama. He's upstairs. He just went up by himself... crawling. Crawling? Yes. He... he surprised me today by giving me a demonstration. But that's too much of a strain. That's bad for him. But how can it be bad for him? It makes him... independent. Well, he... he can't be seen by the children moving around like that. Well, you'd have to discuss that with him. I won't. I can't. Very well, Eleanor. I'll speak to him. Mama, please allow Franklin to make up his own mind in this matter. He must not place such a strain on his body. - He's not a child. - I'll speak to him about it. There are times when a son will listen only to his mother. Mommy, we're ready. Come on, mommy. Sit down, granny. No, darlings, I can't. I have to see your father. Come on, mommy. Come on, mommy. Mommy, you look tired. Well, I am a little, darling. Mommy, who is older, you or granny? Granny is, you dummy! Well... "Now today, being Wednesday, the merry old shoemaker knew that he could only work on the blue shoes because they were the only ones that were quiet and still on Wednesday. On all the other days, the blue shoes would run about and dance and play with all the other brightly colored shoes, but on Wednesday, they were still and obedient. 'Oh, my.' Said the shoemaker, 'what beautiful blue shoes.' and he thought to himself that he would make them even much more beautiful. So he took his hammer and nails and sat down and merrily began to... to... to hammer away." Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Mommy! What's the matter? - Mom! ...For you this time. You must exercise your Patience. Believe me, I am exercising it. But I am not a vegetable. Eleanor, if I can do anything... Nothing. Nothing. I don't know anyone who's more entitled to a good cry. Oh, oh... I must have... I must have terrified the children. I won't ever do that again... Not ever. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mrs. Roosevelt. Hello, Mr. Owens. Here are your things, all ready for you. Thank you. And how's Franklin? My son is doing very nicely, thank you. He's happy to be home at Hyde park for the summer. Remember me to him, will you, please, Mrs. Roosevelt? Yes, I'll do that. Yes, thank you. Here's the last of it. Oh, thank you. Come on. Boys! Getting pretty strong for a little fella. Franklin! Come here! Come here! Franklin! Good afternoon, ma'am. Would you like to buy any small boys today? Franklin, do you think so much activity is good for you? Well, granny, it isn't much good for us. You see, mama, this exercise is not only good for me, but will undoubtedly make giants of my sons. I'll talk to you later. Yes, mama. All right, men. Up we go. Oh, you men are getting harder to handle. Soon I shall have to draw out my heavy artillery. For a minute, we almost had you, pa. Delusions of grandeur. Boys, today, I think I felt a little more power from my legs. Here, in these heavy frontal muscles, the quadriceps. The bad spots we're still working on are in these thick muscles that run from the hips and buttocks, the gluteus Maximus. And then these hamstring muscles on the backs of the knees, the gastrocs. Without those, I can't get balance. I like the name of those thick muscles. The gluteus Maximus. Right there. That's it! Gluteus Maximus! Once I get them all going at the same time, you men had better start running. Oh, I think I left my glasses over by that tree. Would you go over and take a look and see if you can find them? - What tree? - I don't know. Let's look at all of them. I don't see anything. Come on, Johnny, we haven't found it yet. Last one up to the ramp is a rotten egg. Hey, come on! Hey, wait! - Hey, wait up! - Dad! All right, all right. All right. Up the ramp. Up the ramp. Up we go. Push, push. Oh, that was no fair. All right, open the door, boys. All right, boys. That's it for today. - Aw, pa. - No, that's all. I'll race you down to the barn. Let me have a head start. What have you two been plotting in the privacy of mama's snuggery? Mama is reasonably concerned. You should be more careful, Franklin. Your legs haven't healed completely from that last fall. If I'm sitting on the grass, there's very little of me left to fall. - Franklin, wait! - Nothing to it. Well, there you are. Tom swift and his rollmobile. What lovely items have we for inspection this afternoon? This came for you by special messenger. And a good job of printing. I sometimes regret having told the newspapers one of my favorite poems was "Invictus." It's the 14th copy you've received. Franklin, the devotion of your admirers is as stifling as this sticky verse. Eleanor, have you actually agreed to make this speech? Mm-hmm. Good. Between your speeches, howe's shenanigans, and my statements, we're keeping my head above water. Oh, speaking of water, you received a letter this morning from one of your associates in the late, lamented lobster business. Louis, losing 26,000 dollars in a lobster business is hardly a joking matter. Oh, a bit of a “pinch," one might say. To add further to your merriment, this came from the montracol oil company. Good? I suppose so. Ooh, very good. You now own 2,000 shares... of gas. Oh, Franklin, what's this one? This has to do with the investment I made in oil. They didn't strike oil. They found gas. And there's no immediate market for gas. Think how you could have combined the gas discovery with the dirigibles. See you for dinner. He'll probably keep coughing and smoking till he's 90, but sometimes he worries me. Anything else, Missy? That's all. The mail was light. I'm sure Louis hated that. Let's call it a day, Missy. Why don't you take a swim? That's a splendid idea! Thank you. Now, as I was saying, and you know about what. I don't want you to rush and do any damage. You've plenty of time. I've been learning something about time. Being unable to rush things along has given me Patience. Patience, I think, gives a better sense of when to try for the brass ring. Or when to enjoy the ride without grasping for anything? Yes. Mm-hmm. Eleanor, when I first took ill, I dreamed and planned about a bright future, half-believing, half-pretending, like a child on a carousel, imagining himself a general in command of armies. But for weeks now, something's been changing inside me. I don't know when it began, what minute or day or hour, but... Today I was fully aware, that despite everything, I feel sure-footed. A patient man shall bear for a time and afterward, joy shall spring up unto him. Shall spring up unto us. I sometimes wonder how many of your cousins - are still confounded that we married. - Oh. Do you think they still consider me a feather duster? Franklin! There are undoubtedly some members of your family who still believe that you didn't get much of a bargain. I imagine they are reconciled to the truth that I did better than you did. Actually, I think mama's only objection to you was that your family said "ruse-velt" while we said "Rose-velt." Could not a "Rose-velt" by any other name be just as sweet? Not to mama. Thinking back, I can hardly blame some of your relatives. I had a lot to learn. The truth is, I was an awfully mean cuss in those early days. Never mean. Perhaps inexperienced. I was snobbish, haughty. I had the Roosevelt name... Your uncle Teddy's tradition... Sauced in with ambition. I had to learn something about the human heart. I've been learning. You've always known a great deal about my heart. Cousin... Wife... Dearest. Oh, Franklin. When I was an awkward adolescent, I felt unloved, unwanted. With you, I've always felt needed... Wanted. That's a blessing for which I shall... Hello, mother. How are you, father? Sis, you've been developing an irritating habit of barging into rooms without knocking on doors. I just wanted to put these books back. Then do it, sis. Oh! That's a stupid, clumsy way to do it. A rather sharp attack for a mild offense. I'll make it up to her later. Well, I'd best talk to her before she runs to granny. You tell granny everything that happened. Mama, I must talk to Anna alone, please. I have some things to do, Anna. Father had no right to speak to me that way. What else, dear? And it... it's been extremely difficult. Yes, it has. There's been so little chance for me to talk to anybody. Most of the time I feel alone. Anna, when one member of a family is ill, it's difficult for the rest of the family. What all of us are inclined to forget, is that it's most difficult for the one who's sick. Sit down, dear. I want to say some other things to you. And then I expect you to go to your father and tell him that you behaved badly. And I'm certain that that's exactly what you're going to do. Hello, sis. I'm an old grouch. Father, I've been selfish. Now, sis, no confessionals. Well, I have been. I've been mooning around the house like a child. I felt everyone was keeping me out of rooms. I didn't really understand what you've been through. Well, I've been to blame for some of that, Anna. We should have talked before. That's all I ask, mother. Please talk. Everyone is so occupied. We'll all try and find more time. And about my room in New York, father, I actually prefer it upstairs. It's quieter. Anna, dear, most of our blessings come in heavy disguises. Which, of course, reminds me of a story. Way back in the hills of upstate New York, where a lot of poor tenant farmers live, there was a wise, old man whom everybody came to with their troubles. One day, a woman came to him with a sad, sad story. She and her husband and four children lived in a one-room cabin and she said it was simply unbearable. The old man asked her if she had any chickens on that farm. When she said she had, he advised her to put the chickens in her house. The next day, the woman came back and said things were even worse, much worse. so the old man asked her if she owned any cows. When she said she had two of them, he advised her to put the cows in her cabin. And the next day, she came back and said the place was getting to be a horror. So the old man said to her, "you got a horse?" She said yes, she had a horse. He said, "put the horse in your cabin." And the woman did that, too. And the next day, she came back and said it was just too much. It was awful. so the old man said to her, "well, my dear, tell you what you do. You take that horse and those cows and those chickens and get 'em all out of there." and the next day, the woman came back and said, "thank you. Oh, thank you so much. You can't imagine how comfortable we all are at last." Thank you, father, for not putting the chickens in my room. Sis, in the last two minutes, you've grown 10 years wiser. Good afternoon, Mrs. Roosevelt. Good afternoon, Charles. Oh, Charles, would you? Thanks so much. Hello, granny. Ooh, Anna, my dear. You look lovely. Oh, it's bitterly cold, like a frosty night at sea. Tu est trés gentille, ma petite. Thank you, granny. Ou est votre pére? He's dictating to Missy. And your mother? She's out making a speech. Mr. Howe is with her. Indeed? I should like my membership changed from "active" to "nonresident." I cannot possibly play golf myself for a year or two. The usual "thank you" and "yours truly." Greetings, mama. How do you do, Mrs. Roosevelt? Oh, hello, Missy. Franklin, you look peaked. I feel fine. I'm not satisfied. You're doing too much, I can tell. I won't quarrel with you. If you say I look peaked, I look peaked. Missy, you're not letting him overwork, are you? - Well, Mrs. Roosevelt... - Mama, dear, I have one or two more letters to dictate. Very well. I'll go see how the children are. Is it true that Eleanor is out making another speech? You know my feelings about politics generally. I do. It's a tawdry business for a man, and, I believe, shocking for a woman. Mama, women sometimes follow other professions even more shocking. - For instance... - Franklin! That kind of remark would come better from someone like Mr. Howe. Despite the victory of the Democratic party in the recent off-year elections, we cannot assume today that the presidential campaign in 1924 is a certainty. It has been said that nothing is certain in love or war or politics. It is necessary, therefore, that each one of us should continue to apply our energies to the work that lies ahead in the next two years. And this seems to me a grand thing to do. We must anticipate what the issues will be and keep our minds flexible, like a corset which holds its shape, yet has enough give. Well, I... I do think I was better than the last time. You do? Well, it was certainly better than the first one. That it was. When did you think up that joke about the corset? It came to me in a dream. Must have been a nightmare. - We're home. - Welcome back. Well, Louis, how'd it go? You wouldn't be so damned cheerful if you had to go out in this weather. How the devil she stands it, I don't know. "Invictus." It's lovely and clear outside. Oh, my god, it's freezing! Well, how'd it go? Franklin, your wife has almost rid herself of that ridiculous giggle and even manages to make a point now and then with some measure of effectiveness. You mean she was good. Adequate. - Thank you, teacher. - Was there a good turnout? Excellent! Two hundred women. Four hundred. That's the figure I gave the press. Well, the important thing is they listened and... and they signed pledges to work. Oh, and, Franklin, I read them your statement about the league of nations, and it received genuinely warm applause. Did the corset joke get a laugh? Did you know about that? I gave it to her. Mama is appalled at the idea of your continuing these speeches. We'll talk about that later. See you at dinner, Louis? Not me. I've decided to go home for a day or two. I talked to grace. She's been wondering if I've grown any uglier. Also, my son, hartley, looked at the postman this morning and asked if that was daddy. - Oh! - So I've decided to go home to dinner. Well, then, I'll say goodbye, Louis. Louis? - What? Oh. Goodbye. - Bye. Can you breathe through all that? You know me. If I can stand on my feet, I assume I'm breathing. Louis, I'm being reflective. Probably because you're heading for another birthday. Now that I've made this one, everything after is velvet. Part of my reflections had to do with you. Ah, I'm fired. My good friend, as much as you loathe a sentimental moment, thank you for everything. "Out of der night that covers me... Black as der pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul. In der fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade. And yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll... I am the master of my fate. I am the captain... of my soul." Good night. It's a trick! - Aw, please, give us an easy one, - father, give us another one. All right. All right! But just one more. Now, a train leaves Hyde park for New York going 80 miles an hour. At the same time, a train leaves New York for Hyde park going 40 miles an hour. Now, the question is, when the trains meet, which one is closer to New York? Well, the answer's obvious. Well, naturally, the one that left Hyde park at 80 miles an hour. You're all wrong. If the two trains meet, isn't it obvious they're both exactly the same distance from New York? Hold it! Hold it! And what's also obvious to me is you're all in need of some sleep. All right, upstairs, everybody. Mommy, will you be up soon? Yes, in a minute, dear. Good night, granny. Good night, my darlings. Good night, granny. Come on! Sleep well, gentlemen. Good night, father. Good night, sis. - Good night, granny. - Good night, Anna. The papers say it's going to be just as cold tomorrow, so you must remember to bundle up warm. Overshoes, gloves, and something soft and woolly around your neck. I know. And mademoiselle should be very careful with the young ones in weather like this. I heard mother tell mademoiselle that this morning. Very sensible. Anna looks well. But I look peaked. Oh, Franklin, stop being a tease. Would you like coffee in the living room? Yes, Charles, please. I'll help get the tribe to bed. Now, Franklin, Franklin, I've had some men at Hyde park to determine how we can electrify the lift. Now it is, after all, only a large-size dumbwaiter... - And... what? I mean, please don't. The exercise of pulling those ropes is helpful to me. I need it for my arms and shoulders. So, if you're thinking of me, please don't change the dumbwaiter. Oh, but I... Oh, thank you, Charles. Mm, thank you. - Franklin? - No cream, no milk, four sugars. Oh, cream is good for you. I don't like cream in my coffee. To get back to what we were saying, Franklin, I feel you are doing too much physically. I wish I could do more. Mama, it's only my legs that are temporarily bothered. The rest of me is as healthy as ever. I know that. I know that. I talk to the doctors and they tell me. But sometimes I feel that Eleanor, certainly only with the motives of the deepest love, and that ugly little man, push you too rapidly. I don't think so! Dr. Draper doesn't think so! And please, mama, don't refer to Louis Howe any longer with that unpleasant phrase! I've endured it too long as it is! Franklin, your tone of voice is very disturbing to me. Mama, I should like not to quarrel with you. Now, I know how upset you've been. This is a real wrench for you, but I'm going to get over this. And if I don't, and a big if, I shall have to become accustomed to braces and canes and wheelchairs, and so will you. Franklin... Now, please mama, let me finish. - Louis Howe... - Oh! Mama, stop that. Louis Howe told me, while I was in the hospital after Campobello, that I had one of two choices. I could lie on my back, be a country squire, and write books, or get up and become president of the United States. Now, I think Louis's dreams are far too bright, but... I have no intention of retiring to Hyde park and rusticating. You know, Franklin, when you were a little boy, your dear father took you for a visit to the white house - to see president Cleveland. - Mama, I know. Let me finish. And president Cleveland said, "I make a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be president of the United States." Well, he was playing the odds in wishing that. Oh! Your cousin Teddy died because of ambitious people around him pushing him into things... Died because he didn't know when to stop, didn't know that you can't make it the same world for all people. Maybe you can't, but it seems that every human has an obligation in his own way to make some little stab at trying. It's not such a bad world, Franklin. Not at all. I have no personal complaints. I'm lucky. I had rich parents. Well, don't be self-conscious about that, Franklin. Advantages of birth include not only certain luxuries and comforts, but the responsibility for those less fortunate than we are. Yes, yes. Noblesse oblige, the poor will always be with us. We went through that when I sold the mining stock. On reflection, you must admit that was a childish gesture. I would not hang onto stock bringing me an income over the tortured bodies of miners who lived as though they were in the middle ages. These are different times. The attitude of noblesse oblige is archaic! - Franklin! - It's another name for indifference! How dare you?! You are talking to your mother. And even if I were to agree with your romantic political ideas, it's absurd for you to consider running for public office. The traveling, the speeches, would be an enormous strain on you. At the moment, I am not running for anything, and I won't, until I can get around and stand on my feet. But that doesn't mean I have to go into hiding. Oh, I'm not asking you to do that. I'm asking you to be sensible, to take up a permanent residence in Hyde park, where you could be comfortable and where you could use the time for resting, and regaining your strength. I love Hyde park, but I want to use it, not let it Bury me. That's a terrible thing to say! You know what I mean. No, Franklin, I don't know what you mean. I only know that your stubbornness is not only your strength, but your weakness, and you needn't think... I needn't do anything! I am not going to let myself go down a drain! A bad beating either breaks the stick or the student. Well, I'm not broken! I'm not settling for the life of an ailing invalid, and I will no longer abide implications, innuendos, or insinuations that I do so! Oh, Franklin, I don't want you getting angry. It's not good for you. It's damn good for me! Son... what do you believe I want for you? Obscurity? Invalidism? Do you believe that is my ambition for you? Having been a mother over 40 years, do you think this is what I want? Any dream you ever had, or could have, I have. All pain you have felt, I have felt. I don't want to see you hurt. That's enough. There'll be no more talking. No more. Mama, the children want to say good night to you. Franklin? Anything needed... Wanted? Nothing. The same to you! I told him! Yeah, what did he tell you? Thanks, Charlie. You know, you're the only guy here who ever says "thanks." Thanks. You're welcome. Sorry. Later. There's nothing new in that one. It says that Mcadoo and Al Smith are leading contenders. They make it sound like a prizefight. Well, governor, in a way, there is a championship at stake. How does it really look to you men? We think you're a cinch on the first ballot. I appreciate your loyalty, but you don't know what you're talking about. There's not a chance I can make it on the first ballot, and you know it. Do you want any of us with you when you go to see Roosevelt? No. Better I talk to him alone. Have you made up your mind about letting him nominate you? Not yet. It's never been done, governor. I mean, having a campaign manager also nominate. Doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong. Roosevelt as a speaker is not in the same league with Bourke Cockran. I know, but Bourke Cockran's dead. We talked to half a dozen people. Not one of them even came close. Maybe frank could do it. Can you control what he'd have to say? That's what I'm going to see him about. No one's sure he can stand without his crutches. I don't need an acrobat. If he'll say what I want, maybe I'm stuck with him. I'll feel him out. And I gotta make sure he doesn't talk about the league of nations. You can't win votes with that issue. I'll see you around, gentlemen. How do you do, Mr. Lassiter? - Mr. Roosevelt. - I regret that I had to keep you waiting. Mr. Howe. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? Mr. Roosevelt, I know that your time is terribly occupied, but what I have to say to you is of great importance. I recognized the note of urgency in your telegrams. You of course know something of the organization I represent? I do, indeed. We have in recent months expanded the scope of our work, and we hope, very shortly, to have a national pattern of activity. Your name, Mr. Roosevelt, has stood for something important among the rank and file of our membership. Please thank the rank and file. I'll come directly to the point. Your chairmanship of governor Smith's campaign for the presidential nomination has caused much apprehension among many... many of our members. That's curious, Mr. Lassiter. What causes this apprehension? Because of our opposition to governor Smith, we view with alarm your association with, and sponsorship of, his cause. I, for one, am very flattered by my association with governor Smith. What is there about him that induces this opposition among your members, Mr. Lassiter? Mr. Roosevelt, I don't think it necessary for me to dot the "I's " and cross the "t's." I love to dot the and cross the "t' s." Well, sir, you must be aware of the fears that many Americans have when they contemplate the election of a catholic to the presidency of the United States. The domination of the church over its members is well known, and governor Smith is a devout catholic. Would it be more acceptable if he were a renegade catholic? Louis! It occurs to me, Mr. Lassiter, that your members might be satisfied with a personal statement from me that would enlighten them on my views in this matter. I am certain that a statement of the proper kind from you, Mr. Roosevelt, would be of some service. I have something in mind. Missy! Missy! Would you be good enough to type up a statement, please? How many copies would you like, sir? Oh, one or two would be sufficient. We'd print it and circulate it for the best effect. And I shall see that it gets proper circulation in other quarters. I am not worried that the Roosevelt name will be tarnished by any association with governor Smith. If a catholic who has the ability, broadness of view, and fine record that entitled him to be considered presidential timber cannot be nominated or elected president because of his religion, then we might just as well be consistent and say he cannot be governor or congressman or mayor or hold any other public office or be called upon to serve in the army or Navy in defense of his country in war. Is that what you had in mind, Mr. Lassiter? Good day, Mr. Roosevelt. Good day, Mr. Lassiter. I wonder if there's any way of getting the tone of voice you used in print. Unfortunately, there are lots of people who feel exactly like Mr. Lassiter. In this year of our lord, 1924, even if a! Smith were protestant and dry, he couldn't be elected president on the Democratic ticket. If he is the right man, he's running at the wrong time. Well, right or wrong, the governor is 20 minutes late. Mm, convention isn't till June. We can wait. I haven't anything else, Missy. Please type up that statement as soon as you can. You have anything, Louis? Nothing for paper, just a pocketful of second thoughts. Second thoughts, Louis? What's worrying you? First, breathing. I've been wondering what a! Smith wants to talk to you about this afternoon. I would suppose some genial campaign chatter. I think it's something special. Do you think he regrets his appointment of me as his chairman? He still needs upstate New York. You're protestant, dry, rural. You're the logical cowcatcher. No, I've been thinking about Bourke Cockran. Why Bourke Cockran? Ever since Bourke died, Smith's been searching for a replacement. He's been trying out speakers to place him in nomination. Well, if he's finally gotten around to me, it must be a reluctant choice. Why so? Oh, Louis, you know al's always had a patronizing attitude toward me. Listen, kid, let me teach you the facts of life in the big city. Would you be up to it? I sometimes wonder if I could stand the gaff of active work, maybe the dreams and aspirations for public service would disappear in the hard light of practical politics. I'm no idle dreamer, Franklin. Working with you is an act of faith. I believe god has an eye on your future. God has an infinite variety of tasks. I don't believe he's available as a campaign manager. Franklin. The problem is this. To stop a lot of talk from people who say Roosevelt's a nice fellow who once had a fine chance, but isn't it too bad. You might be able to carry it off wonderfully and put the party on notice that you're ready for active service. But you could fail and be headed for the political boneyard. That's a clean picture of the situation. Let's see if ai starts sizing me up as his nominator. And if he does? Then, Louis, my boy, I'll start sizing him up as my nominee. Eleanor, who's going with you? I don't need an entourage. I walk in, say my few words, shake a hundred hands, and go on to the next stop. Why don't you get Eleanor's opinion of what we were talking about? Louis has a hunch, and I'm inclined to think he's right, that al Smith is coming here today to ask me to place him in nomination. I had heard that he'd been shopping around for a speaker. She hears everything. Well, what do you think? I think it's a decision that only you can make. That's taking a well-defined position. I know you'd make a wonderful speech, but whether you're ready to do it is a matter that only you can decide. What about the risks or advantages, politically? I'm no politician. I have the naive point of view that in public service one should pursue principles without calculating the consequences. She's right, she's no politician. There is one point to consider, physically. You'd have to stand for almost three quarters of an hour. Yes. I'd have to go into training for that. Mmm! I like that Cologne! They're ready, Mr. Roosevelt. Oh, Eleanor, I wish you'd take a copy of that with you. If you find a place to use it this afternoon, rattle it in. Hall and farewell. - Good luck. - Bye-bye! I think Eleanor is beginning to enjoy this political prowling. What's more, she's getting damn good at it. That could be the governor. It's late enough. Won't you come in, governor? Good afternoon, governor Smith. Hello, Eleanor. And hello, Missy. Good afternoon, governor. Well, I've never been greeted by a brace of such beautiful girls. Eleanor, I hear you're getting to be quite a speaker. Glad you're on my side. Well, the fact that I am makes my speeches sound better. I'm, uh, I'm on my way to another one right now. Would you excuse me? - Yes, yes, yes. Of course. - Missy? Yes. Hope to see you soon, Eleanor. Well, indeed, yes. - Goodbye, then. - Goodbye. Uh, right in here, governor. - Hello, frank. - Hello, ai. How you feeling? Hello, Louis. Hello, governor. You're looking fit. Hey, that hand of yours is getting like a vise. Some, uh, cold refreshments? Why, Missy, there's a law in this country against strong refreshment. An obnoxious law, nevertheless, law. I know. Scotch or rye? Scotch, thanks, and don't kill it with soda. Frank, I met Eleanor on the way in. She's doing a fine job. She's been taking her lessons from professor Howe. Oh? Louis, you ought to open up a school. Governor, any school of practical politics would have to have you as its clean. I didn't know you could hand out the blarney. Well, frank, I, um, I hear you've broken up your law firm with Emmott and Marvin. What's the matter, the work a little too rugged for you? As a matter of fact, ai, it wasn't rugged enough. I did withdraw on the friendliest basis, but their type of work, estates, wills, et cetera, frankly, it bored me to death. Well, it certainly keeps you freer to do what you want. Your, uh, scotch, governor, still alive, I hope. - And yours, Mr. R. - Missy. Louis, I brought you a soft drink. Reluctantly, thanks. Thanks, Missy. That's perfect. If you need fresh ones, a call will bring you our instant, courteous service. That girl's a Jewel, frank. That she is. Well, they tell me there's a lot of Mcadoo money around town. I wish I had some money to bet. Bill isn't going to make it. I'd like to win this nomination, but there's a good chance it could be a stalemate. Some dark horse might come riding home. I was going over the delegate strength with Belle Moskovitz and Joe Proskauer yesterday. Frank, how do you size it up? I don't think you can do it on the first ballot, ai. Oh? Yeah, that's the way we figured it, too. But neither can Mcadoo. Well, I'll tell you one thing. If it isn't going to be me, it'll never be Mcadoo. I'll fight him with my last breath. He's not my kind of man. A letter reached me. I'd like to have you hear a part of it. Frank, you handle that chair like a scooter. Practice makes "poifect," ai. It's from babe Ruth. I asked him to chairman a committee for you. - Oh, the babe, huh? - Yeah. "No poor boy can go any too high in this world to suit me. You know, we ballplayers travel the country a good deal, and I hear lots of fellows talking about al Smith and his chances to be president. And I'm telling you that most everybody I talk to is with him." How many ballplayers are there? I hope he's as good a prophet as he is a slugger. You know, I sure miss Bourke Cockran during these days. He had a great instinct in these subtle matters of conventions, nominations, and elections. Sort of spooky. Sure miss him, for many reasons. You certainly would have wanted him to nominate you. There was no one better. That's a fact, no one better. He had a magnificent voice, and he knew how to use it. Wasn't just the way he talked, frank. He had a knack of saying just the right thing. That he did. For days now, I've been trying to think just what Bourke would have wanted to say in a nominating speech. It seems to me he'd have argued for you as a progressive. He certainly would have been aware of the issues, the Volstead act, the Klan, the latent issue of your faith. But he might have been willing to point out that the obligation above any one candidate was to keep the party together. I am all for party unity, but I do not intend to temporize on the issue of the Klan, and Bourke wouldn't have either. There's another issue, al, even more important than the Klan. That's the issue of world politics and America's place in it. Bourke would have spoken of that, perhaps. If you're talking about the league of nations, frank, it's a dead dodo. I think if the Democratic party's going to stand, it's got to stand for something big and noble. Oh, I suppose there's nothing wrong with mankind having a vision of a world organization. But it's only a vision. Newton baker wants to submit a resolution to support the league of nations at the convention. Hasn't got a chance. Maybe not, but I think you ought to support it. Woodrow Wilson's been in his grave only three months. And I don't think we ought to let his conviction about the league be buried with him. Well, it's all right with me. I'll talk to the program committee and get them to put baker on the schedule. Fine. Frank, you got any other notions about what Bourke Cockran would have to say? Finally, I think he'd make up his own speech. A large part of which would have to do with the fine record of the man he'd be nominating. Yes, I suppose a few kind words about me would be in order. You know, frank, Bourke had a theory that no nominating speech ought to run more than 30 to 40 minutes. You can read the constitution in that time. It's a long time for any man to be on his feet. A man certainly can't make an effective speech sitting down. You can be sure of that. After all the months I've spent in this chair, I've come to love the time I spend each day standing on my crutches. Fresh one, governor? No. No, thanks. Frank, I'd like to have you put me in nomination. That's a surprise. Caught me flat-footed. Will you do it, frank? Certainly. Fine. I'll want to look at what you're going to say, and Joe Proskauer may have an idea or two. He's a pretty good phrasemaker. I don't mind the addition of a few phrases, but, ai, what I say will have to be what I want to say. Yes, frank, yes, you have made that quite clear. Say, time runs fast. Got some other people I've kept waiting. Charles, the governor's hat, please. Frank, I'm glad you're going to do this. I... I... I appreciate it and I won't forget it. Thanks, ai. I consider this a singular privilege and honor. I'll try to make your choice a good one. I'm satisfied you will. Take care, kid. - So long, ai. - I'll see you, Louis. Say goodbye to Missy. I'll see you to the car, governor. Frank, did you have an idea I was going to ask you? A vagrant thought. Why? Oh, it just occurred to me you were both too surprised to be surprised. Missy! Missy! I'm going to nominate al Smith. Bravo! I like him. He's sharp as a blade. Well, mein boy, Smith will make the announcement tomorrow, and I'll follow up by flooding him with congratulations. Oh, Louis, ease up. Missy, we've got to get a blueprint of that platform at the garden. I want to find out just how far it is from where I'll be sitting to the lectern. - Yes, sir. - About 10 steps, I'd say. Ten steps. I can do that. I'll take Jimmy with me. He's the biggest. Ten steps... About... 20 feet. About. I'll work on that. We've got to get the exact measurement. Work hard, Franklin. They are liable to be the 10 biggest steps you ever took in your life. Perhaps. Or... to be clinical, I may fall smack on my gluteus Maximus. Mother. Yes, Anna? Well, you all look splendid, absolutely radiant. Now, you're to follow granny into the box and remain there until Charles comes to get you after the meeting. Father, there's a lot of people waiting outside to see you! Well, that's kind of them, Johnny. You see, in baseball talk, this is going to be my first time at bat after along, long time on the bench. Franklin... See you later. - Goodbye, father! - Good luck, father! Here we go! Where's the pressroom? Anybody know where the pressroom is? How's it going? Everything appears to be ready except the speaker. Calm down, Louis. The boss never misses a train or a deadline. Are these to be left here or taken to the platform? I told you a dozen times they're to be left here. - Oh, I just wanted to make sure. - Now you're sure. Are you certain copies of the speech got to the pressroom? - I delivered them in person. - Yes, she did. - Oh, Mr. Howe... - Mr. Roosevelt is here. Stand back. Stand back. Good luck, Mr. Roosevelt! Sir, I served as an ensign on the us dyer that took you to Europe in 1918. Didn't recognize you out of uniform. Glad to see you. - Glad to see you, sir. - Good! Good luck, sir. Now, Charles, I wish you'd check as to whether the other car got here and make certain that the children are all right. Yes, ma'am. That very likely is the finish of Mr. Weaver's address to the brethren. Now what? Now bill sweet to second the nomination of Mcadoo, then the roll call, then, if Connecticut remembers its cue, it yields to the empire state of New York, and then... They get one half-hour of little ol' me. Mr. Roosevelt, I've checked everything again and again, and I'm sure everything will be all right. I'm certain it will be, daly. - Are you feeling okay? - Fine. - Is there anything I can do for you? - No, thank you, daly. - Oh, daly. - Yes, sir? I'd like you to make certain that everything's going on schedule. Will you go out, check the crowd, get a few impressions, and then report back? Would you do that, daly? Of course! - Thanks, Louis. - I wasn't thinking of you. He was driving me crazy. Franklin, you ought to get ready. Jimmy? I'm right here, father. Off with the trousers, on with the braces. Franklin... I want to talk to you again about the finish of your speech. Oh, Louis, not again. Yes, again. That phrase of Proskauer's is a rich one, and you're murdering it by not using it at the finish. It's close enough to the finish. I think it ought to be the last thing you say. "I give you the happy warrior of the political battlefield, al Smith." Period. Crash! I don't think so. Period. Crash! You're wrong. It's a sock phrase, and it'll stick. It ought to be the punchline. Oh, Louis, enough. Franklin, may I say a word? Certainly, if you're going to agree with me. Then I have nothing to say. That is hardly a sign of wifely devotion. Your being here and doing this is the important thing. I just think you're losing the value of the last minute or two of a good speech. Louis, I am not sold on changing it. I'm sorry. Not too tight? No, Jimmy, I think it's fine. Oh, excuse me, please. Sorry, ma'am. No admittance. I am Franklin Roosevelt's mother. Please open the door. Yes, ma'am. Franklin! Mama, you are ever the true lady. You came just at the right time, - just as I slipped into my pants. - Oh! Mama, welcome to the smoke-filled halls of politics. That howling mob in the garden is frightening. That howling mob consists of ladies and gentlemen conducting the business of democracy. Well, why do they have to be so noisy about it? Mama, I am all for noisy congregations. I hope our conventions never turn into high-school pageants. Oh, Franklin, this is hardly the time to give me a lesson in politics. I only wanted a moment to say god bless you. He's given me many blessings. Franklin, speak out loudly and clearly. Yes, mama. Franklin, if I know your mother, within a couple of months, she'll be writing a political primer. I know this is awful, but I'm getting nervous. Sweet's taking a long time for a seconding speech. He's only been on a few minutes. It just seems long. Mr. Howe! Mr. Howe, the crowd is enormous, busting with excitement! Senator Walsh says it's time Mr. Roosevelt got to the platform. Missy, you sit in the press section. Let me know what you hear. Boss, I know you'll be tremendous. Thank you, Missy. - Good luck, Mr. Roosevelt! - Thank you, daly! And to you, Mrs. Roosevelt! - Oh. Thank you. - And to you, Elliott. James. Jimmy. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Okay, okay, daly, and... and good luck to you. Better check the braces. They should be fine. Jimmy, if they slip, pick me up in a hurry. I'm ready. Hello, Mr. Roosevelt. All right, stand back! Stand back, here! All right, stand back! Make it clear! Stand back! Make them stand up for Smith, Mr. Roosevelt! It's too hot for a long speech! Good luck to you, Mr. Roosevelt! Let's get out of here quick, Mr. Roosevelt! Think you can make the ramp, Jimmy? You worry about your speech. I'll take care of everything else. Good luck to you, sir. We don't care who you nominate... Ai is a friend of mine. Come on! It's warm in there! Joe, would you do me a favor and walk down and test that lectern? I want to make certain it won't fold up on me. Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen, please, please! Please, give the speaker your attention! Silence, please! There is a good deal of mail accumulating for the delegates in the convention post office. And we urge you, please, to pick up your mail. It's making it very crowded in there. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please! We will continue with the calling of the roll. Connecticut. Connecticut, the nutmeg state, yields to the great empire state of New York! Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen! Silence, please! Take your seats, please! Ladies and gentlemen, the chair recognizes, from the state of New York, the honorable Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ♪ east side, West Side ♪ ♪ all around the town ♪ ♪ the tots sang "ring-a-Rosie" ♪ ♪ "London bridge is falling down" ♪ ♪ boys and girls together ♪ ♪ me and Mamie O'Rorke ♪ ♪ tripped the light fantastic ♪ ♪ east side, West Side ♪ ♪ all around the town ♪
