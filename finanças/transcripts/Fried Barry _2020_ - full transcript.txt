Where the hell have you been, Barry? Hmm? Sticking that needle inside of yourself again, eh? Huh? Come hell or bloody high water, I promise you the next time you leave us don't look cause I'm gone. You hear me? Yes, Suz, it's going to be better, I promise you it's going to be better. Every time, "Yes, Suz. Yes, Suz." It's getting worse! Bullshit. It's getting worse! Do you think it's easy for us alone here? Do you think it... we... we don't need you? He doesn't even look like me. He doesn't even look like you! So now all of a sudden you're not the father. You absolutely fucking right, you're not the father! You don't feed him, you don't clothe him, you don't love me, nothing! It's, it's... You're a useless piece of shit! Useless! Fuck this shit! I don't need this. Barry. Barry, baby, please! Jesus Chris, please don't. Barry! Come back. - Mommy. - It's okay. Please, mommy. - Thinking I know him. - Not any more. They're not working to the spingos, like yes, - yes, can't I set up working. - Wait. Hey, Barry. Where is my money? I was actually coming to see you right now. Ask her. - We were on the way! - I want my fucking money. - Listen. - We... we were fucking coming. - We were coming, okay? - I'll have it on Tuesday. - Where is it? - Tuesday. Just fuck him up. Better have it Tuesday or else. What? Should have fucking taken that out, man. Fuck. This is fucked, you know. Fuck. Let's go. - Barry! Same as usual? - Yeah. - How's the wife? - Ah. That bad, huh? Barry. ...Baz, everything all right? - Ach, it's okay. - Okay. Glad you're here, been having these thoughts all day. Barry, Barry, focus. Why do cartoons have gloves? - You tell me. - I don't know, Barry. I'm asking you. Think about it. Pinocchio, gloves is the puppet, little boy no gloves anymore. Disney said it was because of the fingers, too hard to draw. I get that, totally. Mickey Mouse, though, okay, gloves. But in the beginning he didn't have gloves. So 1927 in "Plane Crazy" like Felix the Cat, black feet, black hands. Alright, 1928, "Steamboat Willy," had shoes for the first time. 1929, "On The Piano," love that tune. Fucking brilliant, right? Suddenly, he had gloves. Okay? But he's not a human, is he? Okay? Is he a man? - Well, he's not a woman. - No! No! No! No! He's a mouse, alright? So why does he have fingers and gloves and everything else? But here's the thing that freaks me out the most. Barry, if he's a mouse, why does he have a dog? He's got Pluto, it's a dog. Now, Disney will say it's anthropomorphic, okay. Gloves make him look more human so you can understand. But I go deeper. I think that Disney was around during Vaudeville, right? So I think he was a little bit racist. I know it, cause I'm a little bit racist that's why I like coming here, okay? So he would watch minstrels, black face, white gloves. What's Mickey Mouse? Black face, white gloves. Hey? Hey? Yeah. Yeah, pst. Do you know what I like about you, Barry? You don't say much, but you're a good listener. You got any plans today? No. I don't. Me neither. My place. Lofty, thanks, but buy yourself something pretty. Thanks, Lofty. Let's go. Okay, Lofty. Who's going to pay for this? You used to be a runner, didn't you, Barry? Yeah, 100 meters. - Oh. - 400 meters track. Trail running at night in the mountains. Nice. Because I always think heroin addicts would make the best nurses because they can always find a vein. Yeah, a little closer, Barry. You don't mind sharing, do you? Needles are expensive. Some things you just can't run away from. Goodbye, Barry. Like this happens every single fucking time. Like I'm the one who forgets my wallet. I didn't fucking check her out. There's no way on earth I'd... Let's go. Let's get out of here, come on. Let go. - Oh, stop! Whoa! - Hey, Jeff. hey. Hey. Dude! - Oh, shit. - I'm sorry, man. Hey, man, I'll be your dude. I mean, I'm... - We will. - So... Do you make chicken sandwiches, bro? Maybe chips? - Tuna? - Milkshake. You're a good listener, man. He's a good guy. You're a good guy. We're just messing with you, man. Hey, I think it's our Uber. Uber! You want some good stuff, man? It's really good stuff. Charlie, man. It's Charlie. Claire, come on, let's get back inside. They're waiting for us inside. - Please, please. - Ew, what did you eat? What the hell are you looking at? Come. - No! - Come on! Unh-unh. You will never, never get that pussy. You wear your face like a baboon and expect the pussy to come running towards you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. On this day, pussy has alluded you, my friend. Two beers, please. Catching flies there, lad, better close your mouth. You two boys look like you need a bit of strange. - Strange? What is strange? - What? You don't know what strange pussy is? I picked her up about an hour ago, she's gagging for it. This one here, she's special, you know? She's fucking special. You know I would hide every fucking chair in the world just for her to sit on my face. You know what I mean? What are you guys talking about? Oh, nothing. Football two, one. Definitely gonna win. - So Danny, boy, we got to go. - Oh, what, why? - Work, thanks for the drinks. - Bye. Oh, no! Just wait. The toilet is that way. Hey, hey! What the fuck is this, now, huh? No sucky, sucky here. Come, come, come, come. Go, you, go! And you, it's the second time today! Hey, good looking guy! Lots of ladies in here tonight. You buy one, you get two. It's free entry, free entry. Come on in there, my guy. Hey! Are you having a good time? Do you want to have a better time? How many tickets? One, two... whoo! No, no, don't! What the hell? Are you fucking crazy! What the fuck is wrong with you? Shit! ♪ Go ♪ Make some noise, whoo! Man, the one time I came to this club and there was a beautiful girl and she had the biggest tits you've ever seen and she walked up me on the dance floor, she grabbed hold of me and she put my face in her tits. I didn't know what to do because I could hardly breathe but I didn't care. So I grabbed them, I said, "Let's go." We went for a dance on the dance floor and then I broke down, settled down and got up and then we came back to the bar and she... she was just like mind-blowing, man. And then we went back to her place and we got back to her place. I got inside, I didn't know what to do because I was so scared because she was a big girl. And all of a sudden she jumped me and smothered me with her tits, I couldn't breathe. And then she whipped it out, she was a man. I didn't know what to do with myself. What kind of music are you into, man? You into oldies or newbies? Let me guess, oldies. Oldies. Oldies, I love the oldies, man. Love the oldies. - Newbies. - Newbies! Newbies, I love the newbies, too. Don't get me wrong I also love the newbies, you know when you're down on the dance floor. Fuck off, fucking... Pst, come here. Hey, come here. Yeah, man. Hey, what's your name, man? Alright, you like to play? Play. Argh! Argh! Shit, argh! Argh! Argh! So, you coming back to my place? My place. No, man, I live around the corner, it's closer. - Yeah? - Yeah. It was such a jolt tonight, those tunes were wicked. I fucking love that DJ. And then I saw your crazy ass on the dance floor. Are you ready to have some more fun? It's been a while since I've fucked someone. Hey, big boy. Do you like that you see? So why don't you come over here? Always the shy ones, isn't it? Don't be shy now. I want you to fuck me like that. Come on. There we go. Oh, oh. Come on. Oh, yeah, that's better. For fuck's sakes, make some noise. - Whoo! - Ah. Whoo! Oh. Fuck, I needed that. Mm, ah. You're going to have to go now. You can't stay here. Hello, handsome. Want to have some fun? I'll take that as a "yes." - It's cold tonight, isn't it? - Bye, mate, have fun. Why don't you want me? What is wrong with me? - Is it this? - Listen! - Why don't you like me? - Sticky Vicky, no! You liked me on Friday. No! It's fucking Thursday, man. Do you know what I get up to on Thursdays? What does it matter what day of the week it is? Listen here, proper, where is your fucking head? Pst. Hey, hey, where the fuck have you been? - Fuck off, Peter. - Okay. Okay. Bye-ee, see you later you fucking bitch! Oh, my God! You're quite the organ pusher, aren't you? Oh. Oh, shit. Argh!

It's the end of the world. Oh, it's the end of the world. - Have you got any money? - I will walk into the light, don't walk into the light 'cause they'll suck you up. The aliens are going to take over. You can't trust the aliens. Did you see a light from the sky? Did you see a light from the sky? Don't go near it. That's aliens. Aliens. A... I'm telling you, you can laugh. I'm telling you, there's aliens. Aliens are amongst us. The end of the world is coming. Aliens, I'm telling you, they're coming. Oh, one day you'll be on those swings. Oh, look what dad's got for you. Hush. Oh, there we go. - I love you. - I love you, too. Yes, look what dad's got for you. Hey, buddy. Hey, hey, hey, pal.

Thank you. How am I ever going to repay you? Back off! How am I going to repay you? Thank you. Fuck off, man. Leave my husband alone. Don't you have anything to say for yourself, huh? Don't you have anything to say to me? Like, I'm sorry, baby, or I love you, baby. Nothing. Nothing, just sitting there like a zombie, Barry. One day, I'm going to be hateful. One day, I'm going to have had enough, enough of your dicks and stuff that you pull. You know what, I'm a good mother. I know I'm a good mother. I take care of our son. I feed him.

But they're literally all damaged. All of them are damaged. Look, there is two or three of them on the floor. I don't think I'm going to pay full price for this. - How about this one? - I'm not paying... This one is not broken. That's also got a fucking big dent in it. Boop! Hello. Hi. Want to try some of my cheese? Say ah. Say ahh. Mm. Yum. Mm! It's nice, eh? Oh. Ugh. Barry? Barry? Barry, come on, man. I've been walking around and around for days in this store. Come!

Straight or right, I think we know, I can't go straight. There's nothing here, Barry! What's going on? Thank you for everything. It's been a wild ride, eh? I'm gonna miss the hell out of you. Take care of yourself, okay? Go home, go home. Sure. So, how do you know Barry? Sure, uh, well, that's um... Ah! Barry?
