SCREAMS FROM PAIN Water! Don't move, you Chink monkeys! SPEAKS IN FOREIGN TONGUE * Curse of Snakes Valley * Thank you. Merci. Chief! Look here! It's him! The Pole that comes here since few months. It's a famous professor. He discovered valuable manuscripts at Sorbonne. This one? You won't be offended, Professor if I invite you for a glass of cognac? And how do you know I'm a professor I recognized you on the cover right away. I don't actually drink it. DISRUPTING MUSIC Here are examples confirming my hypothesis. As the only one in the world recognizes the supchothai pedigree of monastic script. Here you can see these extremely complex ornaments and careful, almost painterly character shading. Of course it was possible only thanks to the high ... It was possible thanks to high-quality paper, on which this record was created at the end of the 13th century. Next Please. This drawing from the 15th century presents a monk ... LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM What is this? Where did it come from? SUSPENSION MUSIC Light! - Where did you get it from? - I do not know. - Where did you get it from ?! - It was between your reproductions. Whose is this? I'm asking, where did it come from ?! End for today. I'll see you in a week. I put this picture. Where did you get it from? I have been waiting for you thirty years. For me? Why? You are the only scientist in the world who believes in existence of prakrawanit culture and knows this language. Are you ... ? Where do you have it INTENSE MUSIC This is the original. Where did you get it from? Science does not know this document. This war booty from Indochina. Yes! I'm sure. This is almost a classic example of a secret krumwanit languagee, extinct culture from the prakrawani region Thai monks used it, guarding in monasteries mysterious relics. You know what? Until now, I was considered a crazy a believer in myths. And now this document ... For me it's priceless. Confirms my theory. You must read this document. I need some time for this. I would like to study it thoroughly in the lab, to determine in what period it was created. If you would like to visit me on Sunday. Good. But the manuscript will stay with me. Deng will see you out. I'm sorry, you've been serving a long time at Mr. Traven? Professor, don't bother asking questions. Deng's tongue is torn out. MUSIC BUILDING SUSPENSE - There's a second manuscript inside! - You have to remove it. It's not so simple. You would have to cut it. It's very valuable only you can decide. I've already decided. I have a very complicated equipment here of my own construction. Can you smell it? Yes, it is a very intense fragrance. You know, it's weird, Professor, but. This smell! This smell ... It smells like jungle. It's fear. That's how fear smells. The jungle then evaporates. CREEPING SOUND Can you read it Professor? This is definitely the same script as what on the external manuscript. Take a look! Oh, do you see here? Similar ideograms occur. Pal and dock have similar accents. Co jest z tym swiatlem? I'm sorry, I will call the porter. - Ready. - Thank you, Paul. FRIGHTNING MUSIC FRIGHTENED SCREAM Hello! Central! I am asking you ... Hello! Beware! If the gentlemen remembered some details, please contact me. I still can't believe it. Venomous snakes in the center of Paris. - Farewell. - Goodbye. - Do you need a ride? - No, thanks, I'll walk. TIRES - You drivin sharp. - Sharp. Who are you? - Inspector Borgo. - I was looking for you. Christine Jaubert, "France Soir". What happened here? How do you know that something happen here? You will allow it will be my secret. - Supposedly a man died? How? - He was reparing the light. He fell off the ladder. Farewall. CAMERA SHUTTER SOUND Please, give me back this film. Can you hear Doesn't matter. Anyway you won't publish these photographs. Good evening, professor. Good evening Mrs. I'm waiting for you No way! I don't pass students at home. But you were wrong! I am not a student. Christine Jaubert, "France Soir". I wanted to ask what happened at the university. - I've got nothing to say. - But you were a witness! - Please ask the police. - You must tell me! I must nothing! EXOTIC MUSIC Mat. "Road to the Grotto of Might and Power in the Valley of Thousand Snakes. If you didn't die killed by my guards, you good-bad, go. Flat stone, snake's head. Move, don't move. - Three times khu ... - Khuman. A great treasure and a terrible weapon. You will rule the world if you liberate power and might. Good-bad you will die. A new life in the vessel of knowledge". Most of the words in this text is ambiguous. Why didn't you translate the words "khuman"? Whit this I had the most trouble. This word has no equivalent in any European language. This is a secret monastery script. The context shows that khuman can be secret element showing the way, but also a serious obstacle lurking for a daredevil. CREEPING SOUND DENG'S SCREAM What happened, Deng? You will let me say goodbye. Professor, isn't it puzzling from the moment of extracting the manuscript snakes circling around us, are they attacking? In the manuscript there is also talking about snakes. The Valley of Thousand Snakes. Professor, what would you say if we went there together? Professor! I'll give you a ride. - I want to take a walk. - I'll take a walk with you. Listen, I want to ask you a favor. Call immediately 2881225 and ask for Jan Tarnas. Professor Jan Tarnas. Okay? Well. Hi. Thank you very much. I'm here. So you say professor that it looked like like snakes attacked the manuscript? Yes. - Phone call to you. - To me? Here? I'm sorry, I'll be right back. Someone did a joke to me. SUSPENSION MUSIC Bernard Traven. Born in 1926 in Marseille. During the Indochina War he served in aviation in the helicopter squadron. He distinguished himself in Laos. Wounded twice. From 1954 in Algeria. In 1960 he retires in the rank of major. Then he appears in Congo. The guy standing next to the president of the Congo, that's Traven. In the seventies appears in Africa alongside the emperor Bokasa. Officially as an advisor, and unofficially became famous for illegal export of works of art. All this time he has been in Paris for longer periods. He even has a home here. In some circles he is known as a collector of old manuscripts. And the other one? I only have this picture. He is Polish. Professor of Oriental Studies. Since 3 months on a government scholarship in France. Unfortunately we don't know what really connects him with Traven. Apart from the passion for old manuscripts, of course. Good. Please continue. When this reporter gave the material to the editor, we routinely reviewed it. We got interested in the photocopy of Laotian document, owned by Traven. Apparently, when they were working on it with this Pole, this snake accident happened. To the point. The ornament looked strange on this document. It didn't fit in with the rest. Our specialists have found that is like a mapping of perforated tape, with the help of which computer recording is being programmed. They translated it into a language understandable for our computers. And what happened? I'm listening. What is it? It's a cerium alloy structure lanthanium and neodymium, and such alloy can be obtained only in a space vacuum environment. As far as I know, neither Russians nor Americans did not carry out such tests. This is getting interesting. I would also like to draw attention to that in the text of this document there is a talk of some terrible weapon Interesting. Miss Jaubert, please don't come in! The chief does not accept. Did the secretary say I'm busy? I need to know, what happened to my article. With what material? Story with snakes at the university. It was supposed to be half a column for me. I hear about it for the first time. After all, my boss put it down for the next issue I do not know. I'm not for issue planning. - Please ask him. - But he's not here! Calm down, please. The case will definitely be explained. And besides, I'm really busy. Miss Jaubert! Miss Jaubert, I understand your agitation. I had an occasion to take a look at your article. - Curious. - Did you see it? - Yes. - Where is it now? - Maybe it's stuck somewhere. - And who are you? Let's agree that I represent publishing house owners. I have an interesting offer for you DISRUPTING MUSIC I would advise you gentlemen to go to building site of the steel mill after visiting old monasteries, it's near in Louangphrabang. Of course. Of course, if time allows us. Mr. Jong, we have a request. It's about help in arranging transport for us. We'd like to borrow a jeep I'm very sorry. You are late, gentlemen. The only all-terrain vehicle that our ministry has put into service yesterday for a journalist from Europe. He came to do a series of reportages, and there is no way to go to the jungle in a passenger car. And there are no car rentals here? I will pay well. I'm sorry. We have too few cars. I will gladly give you a guardian, who will take care of you. Our employee, Mr. Numi, will accompany you. Gentlemen, I hope with nice company the trip will be more pleasant for you. Unforunataly yes. Don't think gentlemen we don't trust you. We do it only for the care of our guests. One hundred thousand trangs for renting a bus? Madness! They will use every situation. You have to get used to it. Professor! O God! - Do you know her? - No, she knows me. Please tell me how much do you want for this piece of trash? You must be kidding. I am willing to pay well. You may have it on one condition. What? - That we will go together. - It's out of the question. Then none of this. Good. Provided about the trip you won't write a word. You forgot that I set the conditions. Good morning. How can I help you. - I wanted to send a telegram to Paris. - Here you are. Will send soon. - Give me that lady's telegram text. - It is impossible. Please, let me go! Not allowed. So what? She sent a telegram to the editor. Tomorrow they are going to the monastery of Lerng Nochta. It's far. You will stay here I'm going back to Paris. And there were no roads here? No, there used to be a jungle everywhere here Only partisans knew about the path trough it. Just like my father. He knew all the paths here. Even to such monasteries like the one in Lerng Nochta, to which you want to get to. And now? Does anyone know these paths? Hey there! What happened to you Good morning. - You do not recognise me? - No. And now? Knight G8, G7. - F8, G7! - And mat! - Andrzej! - Watch out, I'll get you dirty. What are you doing here? - How many years have we not seen each other? - Well, fifteen years, I think. What a surprise! - Where are you going from and where? - To the monastery in Lerng Nochta. It's still a long way but I live nearby. Take me to the car. I invite you to dinner and tea. We have an invitation to dinner. Wait, I will only take my things. - Who is that? - My friend, Russian. - Did you know he would be here? - Where from! I don't like your contacts Mr. Traven! Please hurry up, the water will end soon. I'm going. When I was young I was more interested in the east. I read a lot about it. Then I was interested in Tibetan philosophy, yoga, and now for almost a year I work here in the middle of Asia. And you know what? I didn't see anything! What are you doing here? Tourist? Walking, staring, looking for something? Maybe. TERRIBLE SCREAM LAUGHS... What happened? Nothing, calm down. Just a small adventure. What are you staring at? Stop! This is the latest invention of our biochemists. Paralyzes the snakes, without causing any damage to other creatures. Professor, we could do with it several such containers. Couldn't buy from you? I'm sorry but no. We only have a few pieces left. We will set up camp here. You want to say, this is the Lerng Nochte? Where is the monastery then? One and a half kilometers away, but the car will not get there, besides that it will be dark in a moment. RINGINING OF THE BELLS I brought it here at night. I preferred Numi not to know that we're going not only to the monastery. A gdzie jeszcze? You'll find out on the spot. SPEAKS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE He says there is no such valley. CONTINOUS Tell him that we'll give them all the records stolen from the temple, on the condition that they show us the way to the Valley of Might and Power. TRANSLATES FOR LOCAL LANGUAGE HE ANSWERS He says nobody dared to cross the border of this valley. Nonsense! Let them give us a guide. CONTINUE IN HIS LANGUAGE "We need these holy texts like the sun and air. " - He has to consult his brothers. - Only fast. If they disagree, I will destroy these manuscripts. ANSWERS IN HIS LANGUAGE They agree. This monk will show us the way. ASKS A QUESTION The old man asks how they will recover holy texts, if we don't come back? We will come back here. For sure. CALLS VERY LOUD SCREAM Christine! Calmly. TELLS ENERGETICALLY Not far away from here the zone begins, that no one ever reached. Traven! Hold on. Khuman. Khuman? CONTINUES QUESTION IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE HE ANSWERS Do you remember the manuscript? Three times "Khuman". I didn't translate then exactly that word. The monk said: "Khuman is something, what goes up or down, shows the way and at the same time has destructive power". HE CONTINUES THE ANSWER This is the border of the Valley of Might and Power Nothing there is subject to earthly laws and no one can be sure there of tomorrow. TELLS IN AGITATION We say that the further we go alone. The first khuman indicates the valley. Look what I found! You're genious! A case, please. This is it! Beware! Christine! - Everything OK? - Fine. Drop the line. Wait. We are coming down to you soon. CRAWLING SOUNDS SCREAM Christine! - No! - What happened? Wait, I'm going to you. - What happened? - Over there! HISS Traven! - Traven, help us! - Traven! Hold, there are gas containers there Jesus Christ!. It doesn't work. It does not work! It was necessary to unprotect. WHISPERING: Where did he get it from? But Buturlin didn't want to sell it to him. It looks like that the snakes guarded the underground only at the entrance. - Let's go. - Wait! They would set us up. How on earth are there lasers in the temple ?! Are you sure this is a temple? - How will we go further? - Help me. To the wall. Now run! Christine, what's going on there ?! Stand up faster! Look out! Lasers was the second khuman. Oh God! This is the third khuman! It goes to the manuscript. Throw into the corridor! Stop! This sarcophagus ... In a moment I will start to believe the aliens really visited our planet. This inscription reminds me of a manuscript. "Power and strength is here." Carefully! Step aside. MUSIC SOUND OF WATER Hold on! I'll be right back to you. SQUICKING There it is! I found the way out! Quick! Carefull. Traven? Traven, don't be stupid! Traven, throw the line! Here our paths diverge, Professor. You thought I'd drag you down back to Paris You really were so naive? I needed you only to to get it! You bastard! You son of a bitch! Mr Traven! You left your friends In such a situation? It's unworthy of an officer. MONK SCREAMS What's he saying? If you take it from here, the whole world is in danger of extinction. Nonsense! TELLS CALMLY Monk warns there is good and evil in the amphora. Wisdom and power. He says they hid it here centuries ago newcomers from distant stars. If it opens, misfortune will hang over the world. That's why this amphora must return to its place. - Tell him I don't believe in fairy tales. - These are not fairy tales. And even if it were fairy tales, this amphora is the property of our nation. I must give in to strength. Here she is. What happened between you and Traven in the corridor? - Nothing. - Christine! Traven lost the pilot's plate, which he took out of the helicopter. Guess whit what name. "Captain Bernard Traven". Why did he want to hide that he was here? You think he stole the manuscript himself I'm an idiot! Traven gets rid of the witnesses. Look! You saved our lives. These are your scriptures. I return them according to the contract. Andrei! See what happened here! Run for help! Take a gauze pad and come back here. I run to them. Good. Jan! Jan, do you hear me? Jan! - G8, G9. Mat. - Ah, you crap! Thank you. - See you soon! - Goodbye. Thank you! Take care, Andrei. - Hi! - Keep well. I got you! I won't give you to anyone. Anyone. I want to have you. You're mine. Only mine! I'm very tired. But you will give me power and strength. Will rule the world. You will see! - You came back at the last minute. - Yes? Your plane is leaving tomorrow at five o'clock in the morning. Here are the presents from the airline. Your friend, Mr. Traven, is upstairs. He will kill you! Jan! Let's run away from here! This is the second murder in our presence. Wait, I'll just take a picture. Are you crazy ?! They will arrest us! - Do you want to die in prison? - Wait a second. We will land in Paris at 15.00 local time. We wish you a pleasant journey. The fourth khuman. What will we do with it now? We have the key in our hands to rule over the world. But what can you open with this key? Please, here are the keys. And documents. - The car is over there in the parking lot. - Thank you. Here, I will come soon. Christine! - Something happened? - No. - So what do you have to tell me? - Unfortunately, nothing. We've tried different ways he refuses to answer. Wait for me. How are the trials going? Look at this test. There is a container hidden in the amphora. - But what is it? - We don't know that yet. But the container is alloy of cerium, lanthanum and neodymium. In terrestrial conditions you can't obtain it. - We still don't know what's inside - We must know that. We can cut the amphora with a laser and try this new drill. Okay, try it. Bring Tarnas to me! Fast! SOUND OF A LOCK Wake up! Wake up, let's go! Who are you? I protest against such methods. You have already rested after this tiring journey from Asia? I demand to see the consul. Calm down, please. I want to apologize to you for too abusive an invitation. I was afraid that you won't want to come alone. Why not? I love getting hit in the head from strangers. I see a sense of humor doesn't leave you. But to the point. Please, sit down. No! Here, Mr. Tarnas. And listen to me carefully. I represent a certain organization or an association which deals with research from various fields, and which are usually covered in a strict secret. We became interested in the discovery which you have done together with major Traven. It seems to be because of your interest Traven paid with his life. These are the costs that are always there you have to take it into account. - You can already activate the recording? - Good, you will start in a moment. This is the last moment when can you tell us that what you didn't say. - What's inside this amphora? - I told you I don't know. All I know is that opening it may cause unpredictable consequences Take a look. There's a container in this amphora. It's made of an alloy which you can receive only in a space vacuum environment. You won't tell me that Buddhist monks made it? I don't know if the monks did it. I can only tell you what was in the old manuscripts. There is talk about newcomers from space They sheltered with this container. But what can it be? Don't you guess? It's probably encoded thousand years of knowledge of this civilization. - We'll check it. - Listen to me! I will repeat to you the warning of the old monk. Bad hands can increase evil, which lies in it and bring destruction to the whole world. Think about it are we ready to discover this secret. Still, we will open this container. But if inside there is an explosive, you will die with us. Can we turn on recording? Wait. Okay start, Morineau. Well it worked out. I wonder what that is. Be careful! Hide your face! Immediately! It burns like hell! ALARM Don't touch it! Run away! I'm announcing a biological alarm of first degree. Liquidate it immediately! - But this is Breecher! - It's not Breecher anymore. How will you explain these Breecher mutations? Also found in the liquid significant amounts of the substance with hitherto unknown on Earth genetic code. Penetration of this substance to the natural environment would cause biological imbalance and creating monstrous mutants. Now you appreciate the military weight of this discovery? This Polish professor brought us a biological weapon, of which you can only dream of. If it got into wrong hands, atomic blackmail would be nothing against this weapon. "You will rule the world, if you can break free might and power. I'm sorry, what did you say? It's a quote from a Thai manuscript where it all began. It is clear, that after Breecher's death we can't continue experiments in Paris. We are carrying over further research to the lab on Mataiva Atoll. You will personally take care of transporting this amphora. It's in this container. Captain, look at this, what's happening. I'm calling base! I repeat! I'm calling base! Damn! The radio does not work. - Leave me alone! - It's me, Ivone. - Ivone? - You do not remember? You are tired, you should rest. Yes. How could I forget? It's because these nightmarish ... A nightmarish trip. This jungle, these monks, these snakes. You dreamed about something. You read too much of these eastern manuscripts. I remember. I flew by plane, then we landed, and then ... I forgot what happened next! There was no jungle no monks, no Asia, no snakes, it was a dream. Forget about it. You must forget. And you? I was also in your dream? It was a wonderful dream. I dreamed of, that I fell in love with you. Christine! He doesn't remember anything. Only the dead don't remember anything and he is alive. Thanks to you. He thinks that he fell asleep. And wasn't that a dream? SING IN FOREIGN TONGUE Oh no! No more Asia!
