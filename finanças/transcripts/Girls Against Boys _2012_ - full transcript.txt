[water trickling] Man: You okay in there? [knob squeaks] [distant horns honking] [officer chuckles] - Relax. [distant siren blaring] Well, it's just... I've never done anything like this before. Like what? Uh... whatever it is we're doing. - Woman: What are we doing? - l don't know. l-l just, l never met anyone like you before. What do you want? Tell me what you want. Uh... If you don't tell me, I'll be forced to improvise and who knows what will happen then. So... what is it? What do you want? Could l maybe get a glass of water? [both laughing] No. Yeah. - Come here. - Hold on. [laughing] Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [officer laughs] What kind of game is this? - A really, really fun game. - Yeah? - Come here. - Hold on. [handcuffs clink] - Hold on. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? No, no, come on. - Mm-hmm. Do you know what this is? - What are you doing? No, no, no. Don't play with that. - These are really fun. - Whoa, whoa, hey. - Oh, come on, come on. - No, you come on. [whispers] Oh, God. It's gonna be fun, l promise. Whoa. Where you going? Come back. Come here. [laughs] What are you doing? Hey, where'd you go? Come back. Officer: Come back. Where'd you go? Here, why don't you take off the cuffs? [clicks] - Whoa, whoa. What was that? Woman: What was what? Professor: "Aida" walks a fine line between post-feminist critique and blatant objectification. Images of schoolgirls commonly associated with innocence, perfection, and conformity in Japanese pop culture are twisted and inverted. Severed limbs and shackles play in stark contrast to crisp school uniforms and a pervading sense of serene and subservient calm. Women are depicted as playthings, [professor chuckles] or even as pets. Now, in his series, "Edible Artificial Girls," he shows teenage girls as a pure commodity. A snack food for men. But are these images a rejection of misogyny or a celebration of perversions that are found in male-dominated art throughout the world? [girl sighs] Hey. - Did you get my text? - Hm-mm. What? Wow. Okay. Hey, you're still coming to The Cave tonight, right? Shit. - l totally forgot. - What do you mean? I'm sorry. l made plans. - But you promised me. - l know. And my friend Tyler is playing and l told him you were coming. Why? You know l have a boyfriend. Terry's not a boyfriend. He's like, 45 years old and he's married, Shae. [scoffs] He's 35 and they're separated. You need to be careful. The guy's, like, having a midlife crisis. No, he's not. All right, I'll stop pushing. But l still want you to come to the party. - l told you, we have plans. - What are you guys doing? We're gonna go see the Martin McDonagh play and then we're going to the Hamptons for the weekend. All right, fuck the party. Can l come with you? [laughs] - No? No. Have fun this weekend and I'll see you on Monday. All right. - Bye, girl. - Bye. - Have fun in the Hamptons. - I'll try. [kisses] Come here, Calvin. - Come here. [cat meows] Over here, silly. - There it is. [knock on door] [heels clicking] [mews] What's the matter? Did something happen? l can't see you anymore. Sarah and l are gonna try and work things out. What do you mean? I'm so sorry, Shae. But I've got to think about what's best for Celice. Celice? My daughter. You have a daughter. She's three. You never told me you had a daughter. Well, it didn't seem to matter at the time. [keys jingle] Terry: Shae, come on. [door closes] [sighs] You're a beautiful and intelligent girl, Shae. What we've had together has been amazing. But we can't sustain it. There's a million guys out there your age who'd kill to be your boyfriend. [door opens, closes] [refrigerator door closes] [alarm blaring] [blaring stops] Hi. [clicks tongue] [voices overlapping] [voices fade] [door closes] Woman: Come on, Gus. What are you doing? Let's go.

What can l get you? Large Mexican Cosmo... and your digits. That'll be $82. So many girls... and so little time. Are you fucking kidding me? $3? [laughing] [woman yelling] Brad... oh, my God! Woman: That's so close. l was wondering why everybody was yelling. - What are we doing? - Woman #2: We're related. [women laughing] [music continues] [sobbing] You okay? ls it a guy?

Shae. l know. l started last weekend, but l-- l saw you upstairs on Saturday night. What are you doing now? You wanna get a drink somewhere, maybe? [horn honks] Driver: Hey, l get off at 3:00. No takers? [laughs] I'm not complaining. [chattering] Hey! [dance music playing] Oh, my God. [grinding] - How's it going in there? - Great. What do you wanna do next? Doesn't matter. I'm just happy to be out. l do like, work in sculpture, you know? Yeah. Working with metal a lot. - New friends. - To friends. - Good friends. - Cheers.

[whispers] What are these guys' names again? - I'm Eric. - Eric. And this pretty young man is Simon. Simon. And that guy over there is Duncan playing DJ. Dude, none of that gay '80s shit tonight, man. Lu: You guys live here together? Just me and Duncan. [chuckles] You two lovers? - No, we have separate bedrooms. [music plays] Would you like to see them? Lu: Maybe after you open this beer.

Uh, you need to fill out some paperwork if you want to file a report. It's down the hall. Processing. Room 112. Can l help you with something else? He told me to fill out this paperwork. Excuse me? Come with me. Marshall, number 73. Ahem. Hi. [papers rustle] - Can l help you? l was gonna ask you the same thing. Sorry? Lu: Don't be sorry. Sorry's a sign of weakness. You should project strength.

For starters... we go back to those guys' house and find out where he lives. Men are easy to manipulate. It won't be hard. Besides, if they don't cooperate, l have a gun. You have a gun? l thought it might be useful to have one. Where'd you get a gun? From a guy l met who was a cop. You met a cop and he gave you a gun? l can be very persuasive. So, we go visit Eric and the Duncan guy and find out where he lives. Then we just go to his house. Piece of cake.

Talk to him? What are you, a fucking parrot? [gasps] ♫ This could be love again... ♫ [gasps] ♫ l got hope... ♫ So you gonna tell me his address or what? l don't know his address. Eric might, but he's not here right now. Should be back in a bit. - So... [door opens] Why do you want to talk to Simon so bad? [Lu chuckles] Oh, we don't want to talk. Duncan: Oh. Lu: You think that's funny? Simon said you two got freaky last night. Maybe you're looking for... a little more action? What?

Crunchinate me, Cap'n. You might need a steak every once in a while for protein, but for vitamins and minerals, the captain's got you covered. [door opens] Lu: Guess how much vitamin C is in a bowl of Cap'n Crunch as a percentage of the daily recommended allowance? 25%? Wrong. Hundred percent. They must add that. Are you kidding? They add all that shit. Unless it's in the Crunch Berries. [keys jingle] Do you have an address for where your friend Simon lives? He lives in Brooklyn, in Red Hook. Yeah, we got that much already. We're looking for an address. Your boyfriend thought you'd know it. He's not my boyfriend. Well, it's none of my business, really, is it? Fag. What the fuck is wrong with you? Just fuckin' with you, Ric. So, do you have an address for Simon or not? [sirens approaching] [Lu tapping] Ricky. Focus. Over here. l asked you a question. You're totally weird. He lives in a warehouse in Red Hook down by the water at 609 Halleck Street. - l don't know the zip code. - That's okay. ls-- is that a gun? l mean, is it-- is it real? Jesus fucking Christ! - No, please, wait-- [gunshot fires] [buzzing] [buzzing continues] [spits, coughs] - What the fuck are you doing? - We're gonna cut you up. Okay, okay.

[car door closes] Girl: There. Right there. [crickets chirping] [sobbing softly] [sobbing] It doesn't make me feel any better. What? What we did to those guys. Those pigs? Are you kidding? They deserved it. Maybe, but... it doesn't make me feel any better. It kinda seems like you enjoyed it. Men are all the same. The only thing that stops them from acting like pigs is the fact that they're cowards and they're afraid of getting caught. Did something happen to you? Like, when you were a kid or something? You mean, was l molested by my stepfather? l don't know. l don't have a stepfather. Right. Just asking. When l was about five years old, my dad started letting his friends have sex with me for money. They'd get me drunk and tell me it was what my father wanted and if l loved him, l would do it. And l loved my father, so l did it. But he never paid any attention to me. He barely even spoke to me. Jesus. When l was seven, l got chlamydia. That's when my mom realized what was happening. l think she knew all along, but... it was easier for her to pretend that she didn't. [sobbing] [laughing] What-- My childhood was fine. It was great, actually. Lighten up. Why do you hate people so much? Why do you want to hurt people? 'Cause l can. Come on, Shae. It's what people do. They hurt each other to make themselves feel better, stronger, more powerful. Whatever. That's the way the world works. Besides, it gives me a rush. Tell me you didn't feel it.

How was your weekend? Professor: Early feminist works criticize the western intellectual tradition for its objectionable depiction of women, its misogynist theoretical underpinnings, and its generally inadequate representation of female voices. In the late 1970s, however, a hermeneutics of suspicion arose from feminists who began to feel that gender bias could be revealed by one's perspective on the nature of reality, in one's style of thinking, in one's approach to problems, quite apart from any explicit gender content or attitudes towards the sexes. Do you think it's an accident that the word "hysteria," from the Greek "hysterikos," meaning uterus, was originally conceived as a purely female complaint? Hey. Hi. What you doing? Nothing. l-- l was, uh... l was-- l was just going home, l guess. What are you doing? l don't know. Kicking your tire. - Sorry. - No. Please, kick it. Kick it all you want. So...

Maybe you wanna come to this thing we're having for Halloween on Thursday down at The Cave? My friend Aaron's band's gonna be playing and I'm gonna DJ. Yeah, maybe. Sure. Well, cool. l mean, only if you want to. No, l definitely-- l definitely want to. I'm sorry. When is it again? Uh, it's-- it's Halloween, which is Thursday. Right. You said that. Well... Good night. [motor starts] Where were you? [sighs] Jesus Christ, you scared me. What are you doing in the dark? [exhales slowly] [water runs] - So where were you? - l went out with some friends. - What friends? - Just some people. Girl people or boy people? School people. What are the names of these people? Are you kidding? I'm just wondering since l made dinner and I've been sitting here waiting for four and a half hours. l was just wondering where you were. Did l know you were making dinner? Did we have a plan? Lu: l wanted it to be a surprise. So how was l supposed to know? If you knew, it wouldn't be a surprise. Well... l just thought you'd come home and it would be a surprise. So you've just been sitting in the dark? Yeah. For hours. You're crazy. [spits] [water running] So who were you with, then? I'm just curious. Can't l be curious? Are you hungry? Do you want me to heat you up something to eat? No, I'm good. lt'll only take a minute. I'm not hungry. What are you doing for Halloween?
