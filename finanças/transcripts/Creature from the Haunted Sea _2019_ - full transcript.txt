(slow jazz music) (gun shots blasting) (dramatic music) - [XK150] I had to go to the Santo Domingo Bar, and I had to find Agent XK120, whom I'd never met. (tense music) I looked around the room. Long training and my own instinct told me that the girl sitting at the table seemed the most likely prospect. (dramatic music) - The king is dead. Long live the king. - Is that supposed to be a political remark? - I don't know anything about politics. Do you play? - I never worked, if I can help it. - I meant chess. It's a very interesting game. - So is this one we're playing. Would you like a drink? - I wouldn't mind. - Waiter, bring us a bottle of Chateau Marmot, 1907. - 1911 was a better year. - 1911 it is. - We don't have any Chateau Marmot, but we have a good Chateau Briand, 1922. - Forget it. make it a couple of Rum Collins, Kilo 58. I had to be sure it was you. XK120? - Right. XK150? - Right. Who's the waiter? - One of them. Thinks I'm on their side. - She was beautiful. I could have killed myself for wearing this stupid disguise. Now she would never know me as I really am. I'm leaving tonight. We'll keep in touch by radio. You have the code? - In point of fact. - Yes. - In point of fact. - Yes. - In point of fact, I've got my decoder ring. - Right. Pay no attention to me when I leave. - Right. Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye? - Right. (romantic piano music) (eclectic music) - [Narrator] The 20th century occurred in Havana, Cuba. The Revolutionary victors marched in, and the national complexion changed completely. They had been liberated. The survivors of the old regime escaped as best they could, taking with them only a few meager effects, such as the Cuban treasury and other art objects. It wasn't always easy to smuggle a loot out of Cuba, and so, secret meetings were being held all over the island. This story of robbery, double-cross, and murder begins with just such a meeting. (dramatic music) - Are you Renzo Capetto? - [Renzo] I am. Who are you? - Nevermind who I am. It's the mission that counts. - [Renzo] Let's get on with it. - As an America gambler and gangster, you're above suspicion. Of course, you know that our government has been overthrown. - You know, I heard that. - Shut up. - But not for long. We'll be back. And if you think you've seen executions now, oh boy. - Bravo! - Bravissimo! - Shut up! - But of course, in order to finance a great kind of revolution, it has been necessary for us to steal the Cuban treasure. - Hoo-rah! - Shut up! - Let us proceed. You're going to lose your casino, so you'll be leaving Cuba anyway. You have a big yacht, you can leave anytime you wish, such as immediately. Therefore, I'm going to entrust you a solid trust. Here we have one quarter of the Cuban treasury. Your group, General Tostada, Colonel Cabeza Grande and a squad of men will proceed to Ciudad Trujillo. There you wait for us to contact you and relieve you of the money. One type of which will be paid to you. Do you understand? - I get the whole picture. - Now, you do the rest. Senores. (dramatic music) General Tostada, Colonel Cabeza Grande. Senor Renzo Capetto and-- - My name is Happy Jack Monahan, glad to meet you gents. - [Spy] And now, the gold. (men yelling) (Jack whistles) (dramatic music) - [Renzo] You two had better get into the car. - [Colonel Grande] The General doesn't know any English, Senor Capetto. I'll be his translator for you. Bueno? - Bueno. - Bueno. (speaking foreign language) - [Renzo] Now, it's time to go. Adios? - Adios. - I'll see you later, huh? - Or don't. (dramatic music) (men yelling in foreign language) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - [XK150] The first move in the great conspiracy had been made. The Cuban Treasury was now in the gentle hands of Renzo Capetto, the most trustworthy man ever to be deported from Sicily. They thought they were smart. But little did they know that I, Sparks Moran, was an American agent. Luckily, I had been able to work my way into the crew by posing as a notorious gun machine burglar from Chicago. My real name is XK150. - Hey you. Come on down here and help with this. - [Woman] How'd it go, boopsie? - We had a harried little chase, but we got the stuff. - Crazy. - Hey, Colonel Grande, you can bring your men aboard. - What happens with all that mouth? - I don't know. I thought we'd just have an officer or two, but it looks like we're gonna have a little difficulty. - You will think of a way to remove them and grab that loot, 'cause you're my big, strong, swinging brain. - You're sweet, baby. - Hi Sis. - Hi, babydoll. Did they scare you? - Just a little. - All right, boys, get ready to go. Pete! Take the wheel. Jack, you and Clarks, or Sparks, get ready to cast off. - Well, well, this is a beautiful night for sailing. - [XK150] And so, we left Cuba forever sailing the most astounding adventure to be inflicted upon man. And what a group we were. The big cheese was Renzo Capetto. Alias Capo Rosetto. Alias Ratto Pazetti. Alias Zeppo Staccato. Alias Shirley Lamour. At 15, he served his first stretch for rolling a drunk in the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria on New Year's Eve 1934. In 1940, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to nominate Benito Mussolini for the Republican ticket. During the war, he was rejected by the Navy, the Marines, and the SS. Now deported, he has retained his contacts with the syndicate and is still regarded as a dangerous character. Mary-Belle Monahan. Alias Mary Monahan Belle, alias Belle Mary Monahan, alias Monahan Mary-Belle. They say she was a gun moll just because Lucky Luciano gave her a Rolls Royce every Christmas. And they can't really prove that she sneaked into the Hollywood Ball with a tommy gun and rubbed out the convention of police chiefs in 1956. All I know that she got nailed cold when she was pushing heroin in a laundry room in Boys Town. But, I'm willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt, especially when she's as crazy-looking as Mary-Belle. This is Happy Jack Monahan, so called because he developed a muscle spasm in his cheeks from watching too may of Humphrey Bogart pictures. Happy Jack's record is brief. His only crimes having been committed after his sister, Mary-Belle, talked Renzo into giving him a job. Up until that time, Happy Jack had been a tennis bum sleeping under the bleachers at Forest Hills, and mooching nickels in the BMT subway. Since taking up with Renzo, he has become a well-known dice loader and murderer. The last member of the deadly quartet is Pete Peterson Jr, son of Pete Peterson Sr, famed vaudeville bird mimic. Pete Jr. inherited his father's talent for animal imitations, but unfortunately, he blew his brain out of wack while imitating a whooping crane at the Elks Convention picnic in Oshkosh in 1942. Since then, anyone has been able to convince Pete of anything. Renzo found him struggling along as a pickpocket at Jones Beach and took him with him in his exile. Since then, he has been Renzo's faithful servant, shining his shoes and rubbing out his enemies. In return, Renzo permits him to imitate any animal that comes into his head. (imitating yak) That, for instance, was the mating call of the Himalayan yak. There they are, my shipmates. I didn't know where they were taking these unsuspecting Cubans, but I knew they were taken. And so, with grim faces, we set our helm against a perilous future. (singing in foreign language) - Okay, now, before I begin, does anyone anything to say? Pete? (imitating cow mooing) How about you, Jack, what do you think we should do? - Give up? - Oh, now, honey. Is that anyway for Mary-Belle's big man to talk? - Now, look. We've got to get rid of at least half of these Cubans without making the rest of them suspicious. There used to be a Cuban fisherman by the name of Hemingway. Got hooked on a sea monster in these waters a couple of years ago, and he was dragged for miles. Got a lot of publicity. We're gonna show these boys the greatest sea monster they ever saw in their lives. Jack, in my trunk, there's some garden rakes used for weeding tomatoes. You get them and sharpen them like scalpels. Pete, you mix up a mess of olive oil and green ink, and spread some seaweed from over the sides. Now, Jack, what are you gonna do? - Sharpen up the garden rakes? - Good boy. Pete? How about you? (imitating dog barking) - Does he have to do that? - All right, Jack, beat it. (singing in foreign language) We've had a good life together, haven't we, baby? - You know it, boops. Winters in Tijuana, summers in Cicero. Remember that wonderful trip we took to Monte Carlo? - You mean the time we heisted all those $100 chips? Sure. - [XK150] I'll admit I couldn't really hear anything through that door, but I was sure they were up to no good. I it was up to me to stop them. - Now, we're off again to parts unknown. - It's like a second honeymoon. - You know something? We ought to get married. - Now, don't be a drag, baby. - How much drag do you think's in the strongbox? - There's plenty of Cuban sugar, though. - What are we gonna do with all of it? (mellow music) - I don't know. I always wanted to open a home for the aged hoodlums. - Baby, you got a heart as big as all outdoors. (upbeat music) - A government agent lives in constant peril. I devised my undetectable radio set using simulated hot dogs for knobs and tubes inside of dill pickles while watching a number of sewer workmen during lunch hour. It comes in mighty handy, believe you me. One little slip, and I could be headed for Davy Jones' locker. Hello, Havana, this is agent XK150. Over. I'm making my first official report. So far, not too much has happened, but I'm anticipating. Renzo Capetto and his gang are on board as suspected. I am with them. I will call you again soon one of these days. This is Agent XK150 signing off. (upbeat music) - What's happening? - Just having a bite. - Gee, that looks good. Do you mind if I join you? (upbeat music) - Come to mama. Crazy. (speaking foreign language) The general says, "Good morning, you gorgeous beautiful creature." - Would you ask the General to remove himself from my presence? (speaking foreign language) The general said you're, um, you're a golden angel flower singing. - Would you tell the General that I feel that he'd be most at home barbecuing slowly over a hot spit? You must be a glutton for punishment. (whimsical music) Oh now, what do you want? - You're too good for this life. You're young and you're innocent. You should get out. Won't do you good. - Are you unwell? The getting is great. - You're a victim of circumstance. - I try. I do try. - You're a crazy mixed-up kid. - I'm perfectly adjusted to my life of crime. Now, what is your story? - Oh, well, you see, I'm beyond help. But you're not. You can find a clean young man to marry. - I haven't got the time! - But I can help you, Mary-Belle. - You can turn blue. - Don't worry, Mary-Belle. I'll save you or die. - Is that the comforting alternative? (dramatic music) - [XK150] A secret agent should never sleep. But there I was dreaming of Mom's apple pie while up on the deck, Renzo and his cutthroats were taking the first step, killing an innocent from Cuban and pretending some imaginary monster did it just so they would be panicked into changing course so that Renzo could steer them to his own picked destination. (Jack whistling) (dramatic music) - Pete, wait one minute, then give the alarm. (dramatic music) - [XK150] But what none of us knew was that the monster invented by Renzo had already been invented by somebody else, by a couple of other monsters, I guess. (screaming) (dramatic music) (men yelling) - Help! Police, murder! It's a monster! (speaking foreign language) - What did he say? - The general says, "What happened?" - Well, I have an idea, if you'd like to hear it. - Please, go ahead. - Well, I don't think it was anything human that killed his soldier. See the tracks and the claw wounds on their bodies. In my studied opinion, those soldiers were attacked by some weird creature from the sea. It came in, did your boys in and vanishes. What's so funny? - A creature, how silly! Do you really think it? (speaking foreign language) - Cue us, Colonel. - Well, the general says, you're right. It is a monster. (speaking foreign language) The general says these waters are very dangerous, so we must plan a new course. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - Catch that? Our brave General Tostada didn't miss an excuse to blow the trip and change course. - Do you think he's got a glint in his eye? - Pure gold. Maybe we won't have to knock them all off. - Aww. - You boys are getting careless. I told you to kill one, not two. What's the matter, can't you count? Okay, Pete. All right, take the wheel. - Well, gee, I thought it was only one. Oh, I can't figure this out. (dramatic music) - [XK150] So, we were going somewhere I didn't know. Washington didn't know. Renzo didn't know. We all had to find out. - Well, gentlemen, I think we ought to make our decision. (speaking foreign language) (Pete howling) Thank you, Pete. Now, has anybody got an idea? - About what? - About where we're going? I thought it was to Ciudad Trujillo we were going? - Oh, no, that's been changed. General Tostada thinks we ought to change course in order to escape the monster. (speaking foreign language) - Caracas, Venezuela. - No, no, no, no. I think we ought to go to-- - Let's go to India! I've always wanted to see a sacred cow. - Actually, I think we ought to go to Cannes. It's really swank this time of year. - Will you listen? - So strange, my friends. I always had a secret desire. Always wanted to go to Bali, you know? - Bali? - [Both] Bali? Bali? (dramatic whimsical music) - We are not going to Bali. - Caracas, Venezuela. - No! Please tell the general that I am convinced we ought to go to San Juan, Puerto Rico. (speaking foreign language) - This is agent XK150, calling Agent XK120, via 190SL. Come in, Havana. - Now, the first thing we got to think about is to escape this stinking monster. Now if you take a look at the charts, you'll notice there's a lot of deep water just north of Puerto Rico. Too deep for the monster to live in. - Well, how do you know he can't live in deep water? - Because of his feet. He's a walker and he's got to stay at the bottom, all right, stupid? - I'm not stupid. - Now, when we get to Puerto Rico, we'll take the strongbox ashore. Now as an American, I won't be noticed. I'll take a plane up to Cuidad Trujillo. Take the box with me. - I can say unequivocally, without the slightest qualm of doubt that the gang is heading for Bali. I think the government should watch for us at the Panama Canal. Over. (speaking foreign language) - The General says it's all right. We may go to Puerto Rico, but he won't keep the strong box out of his sight. - Okay, it's a deal. (dramatic music) What do you think of this, Sparks? - It looks like a Portuguese fishing boat to me. - Good guess. But you're wrong. The Cuban Coastguards. Looks like they're coming this way. Maybe they're looking for the gold. Say, Pete. Tell Tostada and his men to stay below. Sparks, see if you can catch a fish. Everybody keep your guns handy. - [XK150] I don't have any guns. - Mary-Belle give him one of your guns. - No! - Give him one of your guns, Mary-Belle. Now, let's appear casual. Mary-Belle, sing a song. (mellow music) ♪ Oh, kiss me ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ Please kiss me fine ♪ ♪ I'll make you forget ♪ ♪ What you got on your mind ♪ ♪ Oh, kiss my full lips ♪ ♪ They're nice ♪ ♪ You bet ♪ ♪ So kiss them ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ They'll make you forget ♪ ♪ The war ♪ ♪ Remember somewhere ♪ ♪ In '52 ♪ ♪ I met you ♪ ♪ Somewhere ♪ ♪ In '52 ♪ ♪ You kissed me somewhere ♪ ♪ Oh my ♪ ♪ Oh, kiss ♪ ♪ Me baby ♪ ♪ Don't you make ♪ ♪ Me mad ♪ ♪ I can make you forget ♪ ♪ All that you never had ♪ ♪ Oh, kiss me ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I am ♪ (ship horn honking) ♪ Divine ♪ ♪ If you ever ♪ ♪ Wanted me ♪ ♪ You kiss me ♪ ♪ Fine ♪ ♪ And the creature ♪ ♪ From the Haunted Sea ♪ ♪ You'll never need ♪ ♪ To feel ♪ - Ahoy there!

I don't think you've got any authority to search this ship. ♪ In '52 ♪ - I think this the authority to search this boat. - Well, as you can see there's nothing on board. - I haven't seen anything, I wanna take a look down below. - [XK150] He didn't sound like a Cuban to me. I figured in this situation I'd better stick with Renzo, so I decided to knock out leader of the Cubans with a fish I had on the end of my line. - Sparks! Hey, good work, Pete! Listen, we better check the boat and see if there were any others. ♪ Oh, kiss me ♪ - Mary-belle, you can stop singing now. - You have this terrific voice. - Oh, if I could only push you overboard. - Your talents are being allowed to molder away unknown to humanity. You could be a star. The toast of three continents, your name in lights. Let me take you away and deliver you. - I just can't believe that you're real. - [XK150] She was madly in love with me, only she didn't know it yet. - I think I smell land. Are we almost there? - Oh, about six or eight hours. - Another lucky shooter. For the point. - You're ravishing. - You're sick! - Listen, I have a plan. As soon as we get there, we'll wait for night. And when Renzo isn't looking, we'll jump off and swim for shore through shark-infested waters so no one will follow us. Then we'll steal a sailing dinghy and head for Brazil. How do you like it? - I think it's grand, you ought to do it. - Well, I meant you too. - Honey, I wouldn't ride on the same bus with you. - Now Pete, I want you to listen carefully. On the north coast of the Big Island, there's a teeny speck of land called La Isla del Boracho, named after one of Columbus's lieutenants. It should be deserted by now. We ought to be able to land there, huh? (imitating monkey) Good. Now, there's a reef around the island, and a very narrow opening which we have to go through. I am going to run this yacht on the rocks right at the entrance. Now, during the panic, we'll take the strongbox, load on a skiff, and head for shore. Now, Pete, when we get over 30 feet of water, I'll give you a signal. And then I want you to capsize the boat. You understand? Later, Pete, we'll come back and dive for it. You understand everything? - Sure. We hit the rocks, - Yeah. - and then we put the box in the skiff, and then we dump it over 30 feet of water, so we can come back and get it. And that's because it's filled with nitroglycerin. That shouldn't be on board anyway. (whimsical music) - Isla Boracho. - Look at these reefs! (dramatic music) - Reefs dead ahead! (dramatic music) - We're starting through. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) - Come on, baby, I'll save you! - Oh please. - Come on, it's a long walk, Mary-Belle. - Remove your hands, sir. - Very well, I won't leave you, I'll never leave you. We'll drown together. - You're demented. - Come on, life's short. - My, what a short memory. - What the hell was this? (speaking foreign language) - There are still a few miles left, and we will be underwater. - It's all right, be calm everybody. The boat's insured. (imitating donkey) (yelling in foreign language) (dramatic music) (shouting in foreign language) - [XK150] Everything went according to plan. For Renzo and the monsters. (dramatic music) ♪ Row, row, row your boat gently up the creek ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, I'm going to be sick ♪ (dramatic music) - [XK150] You know, this reminds me of one time on Lake Minnetonka. Louise Schmidt and I were paddling along, when what do you think happened? (dramatic music) - The general said you have your orders as soon as he can estimate the situation. - Well, you can tell ol' General that he's through giving orders around here. Now look. You men have no money and you have no guns and you're on U.S. soil. That's all right, I'm on your side. Pete. I want you to search the island. See if anybody lives here. Jack. You take one of the lifeboats and row to shore. Make your way to San Juan and rent us a fishing boat and plenty of diving gear. (Pete squealing) Ah-huh. Come on, boys, let's go. (Pete baaing) Oh Colonel, you see if you can get your men to build us a lean-to or something to keep the rain off. - Attencion. - Come on, baby. (speaking foreign language) Isn't this just great? - Could stay here forever. - That won't be necessary, baby. - Why? - Well the way I figure it, these Cubans aren't very much at diving. But Jack, Pete and I are all pretty good spear fishermen. We'll go down, find the strongbox, and hide it in a hole in the reef. After that, we'll tell the Cubans that it's no use. We give up. It'll be safe there for months, even years until we're ready to come back and get it. You like it? - Boopsie, sometimes you are so smart you make me sick. (dramatic music) - Hello, operator? Get me Havana, Cuba, 652-314. Cuba. (speaking foreign language) Oh, listen, I don't have the right change, so would you mind charging that to my home phone which is in Washington DC? Uh, in the U.S.A. It is 762-691. (speaking foreign language) Washington. (speaking foreign language) Whatever. Right, thanks a lot. Huh, the service is terrific. Hello, Santo Domingo bar? Is there a girl there playing chess? You're right, I want to talk to her. Hello, I'll give you all my utilities and all my railroads for Park Place. - Not a chance. Go directly to jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect your $200. - XK120? - Right. XK150? - Right! Listen, I, uh I can't really talk now. I don't know exactly what's happening or where I am, but I have a feeling that this case is about to bust wide open. I can't talk now, someone's waiting to use the phone, but I'll keep in touch. Did you get that? - Repeat the last part of that message. - I'll keep in touch. Did you get that? - Right. Which way do I turn this decoder pin? - Left. - Left? - Right! - Right! (dramatic music) (whimsical music) (imitating lion) (creature roars) (imitating lion) (creature roars) (imitating lion) (imitating monkey) (imitating lion) (whimsical music) (imitating rooster) (imitating hen) (whimsical music) (imitating ape) (whimsical music) (imitating bear) - You have to be good for something now. (speaking foreign language) - Hello. (Cubans shouting) Eat, eat, it's good, it's good. - Where'd you find her, Pete. (Pete laughing) - Pete, aren't you going to introduce me to the lady? - Isn't she beautiful, Renzo? - Very lovely. Where did you meet? (imitating elephants) Oh no. - That must mean they're in love. (imitating dove) (Pete laughing) - I wish you many happy returns of the day. - Oh, isn't that a ring you're wearing, Miss, uh? - Porcina Perez. - It's a wedding ring. (dramatic music) - Hop along, baby doll. - Aloha! - [Pete] Get the equipment? - Oh, oh about 20 bottles, 10 regulators, masks, spear guns, the works. - Overdid it as usual. Well, okay, we're gonna start diving this afternoon. - I brought something else along with me, too. (speaking foreign language) Carmelita, I'd like you to meet Renzo Capetto, my sister, Mary-Belle. - Hi. - Hi. - Mr. Pete Peterson and... Well, I don't know who the large woman with him is. - Porcina Perez. - Hi. - Hello everybody. - You found this woman in San Juan? - Well, she was living in a sort of sorority house down by the docks. She's awful friendly. - Why don't you come on with me, honey. I'll show you our sorority house. - Senor Capetto, I have the honor to report that my men will be ready one hour. - Ready for what? - Dive to the strongbox. - You mean, your men are divers? - Yes, they are the Cuban Army frogmen. - Ole. (dramatic music) - [XK150] I had the situation well in hand. Mary-Belle was weakening, as I'm sure you noticed. Then, she came into my life. I didn't see her coming, but somehow I sensed her presence and knew that my life was changed forever. - Hello. - Hello. Who are you? - Carmelita Rodriguez. - Sparks Moran. As a trained espionage agent, I could tell that she was attracted to me. But I wanted Mary-Belle, and Mary-Belle wanted Renzo. And Renzo wanted the gold. - Hey, hey, hey. Sparks, Sparks. Idiot! Let's keep this thing firm. - Are you alright? - Oh yes. - All right, we're ready. Where's the Cuban army? - I don't know, but I'm ready. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - No. No, gringos, no. (screaming) - All right, now Pete, jump in. (imitating elephant) - Bye! (dramatic music) - Good luck, boopsie. (dramatic music) - [XK150] The search for the strongbox had begun. But the sea was cluttered up with Cubans dispersed by General Tostada to search independently. All those Cubans alone in the deep. This was a chance for Renzo to again become the sea monster. A lonely Cuban had found one of the many wrecks on the bottom, and Renzo had found the lonely Cuban. (dramatic music) Their attack was cleanly executed. The victim was dead. The killers, delighted, but not satisfied. Renzo must have another quart of Latin blood. We waited sensing the dangers below while the unholy three sought new prey. It didn't take long to find it. (dramatic music) - [Carmelita] What happened to him, was he hurt? - No, it was a monster! - What do you mean a monster? - A real live honest-to-goodness monster with claws and everything. - Are you nuts? Who did this? - Carmelita, it's too dangerous for you here. Let's run away and live a little. - No, no, I'm in love with Sparks. - Sparks Moran? - Si. Well, how can you be in love with him? He's an idiot. You ought to be in love with me. - No, I'm in love with him. And I don't care if I never see you again. - Oh, if I'd only paid my life insurance premium, I'd kill myself. - Oh, no, no, no. Don't kill yourself. - But why not? - No. You come with me, I'll show you. Come with me to the the jungle. - You've seen one jungle, you've seen them all. - You come with, you'll see, and you like. - Hello Colonel. - Senior. I'm very much afraid of this monster. - Well, then just pick up and go home. - No. I am an officer. We will not stop until we have the strongbox. From now on, we'll dive with spearguns. - Crazy. (dramatic music) - Mango! Mango! (dramatic music) Mango! (dramatic music) Senor Happy Jack, this girl is my daughter. Her name is Mango. - Mango? (speaking foreign language) - I was telling her what that Carmelita do to you. I was telling her to cheer you up. - Gee, thanks, Porcina, but it really wasn't necessary. - Oh, but you no like Mango? - Oh yeah, I like it. - She not speak good English well, Senor. - Well, I don't think that's gonna matter at all. - Okay. I'm going back now. Mr. Pete Peterson Jr., he is waiting for me now. - Adios, Porcina. - Adios. (mellow jazz music) (dramatic music) (imitating bull) (dramatic music) - Are you all right, Porcina? - Oh, I'm all right, my hero. - Hey, where's Happy Jack? - Oh come on, I take you to them. - Them? - Yes. - Oh, I don't know what you said, Mango, but it was sure was wonderful. I feel the same way, Mango. I never felt like this in my whole life. Oh, I know, Mango, I know. (upbeat music) Why, here comes Pete and Porcina. (upbeat music) - Hi, Jack, who's your friend? - Oh, this is Mango Perez, Porcina's daughter. - Gee, she's almost as pretty as her mother! - Yes, she's wonderful. - Yeah, but can she do imitations? - Well, I don't know. And I don't care 'cause I love her. - Gosh, you gonna marry her? - Yeah, well why not? - Why not? If you marry Mango, and I marry Porcina, I'll be your father! (Porcina hooting) What kind of a bird call was that? - Oh, we cannot talk here, we cannot talk. My (speaking foreign language) husband, he make big trouble. - [Pete] Yeah, I just had a fight with him. - You know, Pete, I'm getting tired of all this running around. You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to marry Mango and settle down here. I could start a tennis club. - They don't have clubs. They have with rackets. - You know, you're right. - But you know something, though? I'd like to do the same thing myself. Say, why don't we rub them all out? And this way, we can keep the strongbox for ourselves. - Oh yes! Oh even Mary-Belle? - Oh gee. I don't know about her. - Well, she is my sister. 'Course, we could keep her around to do the housekeeping. - Sure. - And she'll get over losing Renzo. - Sure! - Well, how about it, is it a deal? - Sure! Besides, they've been cheating on their income tax anyway. (speaking foreign language) - Mango, she want go swimming. - All right, let's go. - Where's Pete and the boy? They know we should be diving this afternoon. - I think they're somewhere in the jungle. (speaking foreign language) - What's this? Well, what is this? - This man's wife is playing around with Mr. Pete. He's very angry. - That's tough. (speaking foreign language) - This man wants to sell you his wife for $50 and a case of rum. - Tell him, he's nuts. (speaking foreign language) - Carmenita, will you talk to him? We're busy. - Oh sure. We'll tell him to cut down to 20 for a fifth of gin. - Gin nothing! Who wants to buy his improbable wife? Come on, General Tostada, let's get going. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) All right, baby, listen, you hold on to these, because I can't use them without Pete or Jack to help me. - I'll keep them warm for you. (dramatic music) (Pete laughing) (dramatic music) - You're it! - You're it! (dramatic music) - [XK150] Renzo Capetto had at last found the strongbox. And the unknown partner had found Renzo Capetto. (dramatic music) - No! You're it, you're it, you're it! (dramatic music) (Pete shouting) (dramatic music) - Mango! Mango! Mango! (dramatic music) Mango! Mango! - Mango! Please, find my daughter, please! (dramatic music) - Mango! Mango! - Mango! Mango! (dramatic music) - Why'd you have to do it, Renzo? - Why did I have to do what? - Don't play games with me. Why'd you kill her? - Jack, I swear, I had nothing-- - I said, don't play games. We all saw the same five incisions, and those brown marks with that stupid toilet plunger. - Why don't you ask Mary-Belle. I gave her the rake before I went under. - That won't play. You had two more in your trunk, just in case you said, remember? - Yeah, I remember, but they're still there. I can't convince him, honey, maybe you can. - I'm sorry, honey. Afraid, I'm gonna have to go along with Jack. - You think I did it? - What else can I think? You made that monster up out of thin air. Now, don't try to tell me it's real. I am not that stupid. - Well, I am. I always believed in it. - But it's gotta be real. Either that, or the Cubans are trying to kill us off. - I can't buy that. - I don't care what you buy. From now on, we're gonna dive with spears like the rest of them. We've got to get rid of the rest of those Cubans as quickly as possible. We'll start tomorrow morning with Tostada. Jack? (barks) Pete? (dramatic music) - [XK150] Possible death notwithstanding, the courageous General and two of his men dove once more into the deadly sea. But, as usual, they were not alone. Renzo waited for them to separate. (dramatic music) One pulled away, and then there were two. (dramatic music) Tostada went out alone into the forbidden void with the killers closing in. (dramatic music) The giant observer stood watching over a pathetic bit of cloth, all that remained of Mango. At last, Tostada had found his gold in his own watery grave. (dramatic music) The General died as all Generals should. His greedy murderers let his body drift away while they congratulated each other. (dramatic music) Happy Jack found the scrap of a dress and knew what had happened to his beloved. Suddenly. (intense dramatic music) - Don't touch me! - Oh honey! - Go ahead, try to talk yourself out of it. Try to talk yourself cool this time. - Baby-- - Tell me the Cubans did it. Only they were on board pulling in the general. Now, who was down there with Jack? - No, baby, you gotta believe me. - I don't have to look at you again! (dramatic music) Oh, Renz, ooh! - Mary-Belle, I saw what he did to you. They killed your brother, and now, you've got to leave, Mary-Belle, and there's no one to help you but me. Oh, Mary-Belle, I love you so much that I could switch. - Get, get on! (dramatic music) - What do you do to my man? - Oh, shut up! (dramatic music) - I'll save you. (dramatic music) It was dusk. I could tell because the sun was going down. - You were right, Senor. All my army's finished. I knew when the General died. I don't care about the box anymore, or the monster will get me. I don't want him to kill any more of my men. - Neither do I, Colonel. - I think we must go to Ciudad Trujillo in the morning. - You can go anywhere you like. I'm going home. - To America? - America? No, I can't go back there anymore. Sicily. - Oh. - I've got an uncle there who's been after me for years to help him stomp grapes. It's beginning to appeal to me. - Mary-Belle hates me. - I know. But I love you. - Kind of nice having somebody love you. - Why don't you try to love me? You might like it. - I guess I can try. She pressed her hot Latin lips against mine. And I forgot everything but Carmelita. But our silent partner was not going to let me forget. This was it. There was but one thing a responsible trusted representative of the United States government could do at a time like this: get out of there. - Mary-belle? - Yes? - Honey, I'd just like one more chance to explain. Please. - All right, boopsie. Doesn't really matter. No matter where you go, or what you do or who you kill, I'll love you till the day I die. (speaking foreign language) (intense dramatic music) (screaming) - [XK150] Renzo loved Mary-Belle but was the skipper, and decided to go down ahead of the ship. (intense dramatic music) (screaming) (intense dramatic music) (mellow music) Carmelita, I've never known a girl like you. - Did you spend all your life in a monastery? - Carmelita, I love you and I, I want to marry you and take you away from all this. - Mmm, that I would like it, I think. - Of course, we'd have to live on the salary of an America spy, which is $41.50 a week. - I don't care. You so strong, so intelligent. You solve, yourself, the whole case. You are the smartest (speaking foreign language) in the whole world. - I'm not really as smart as I look, Carmelita. You see, I, I have to admit that all that time I thought Renzo and the Cubans were trying to steal that strongbox. But I was wrong. The real killer was a monster. - So what. You're beautiful! - [XK150] So, I got the girl. And guess who got the gold? (burps) (dramatic music)
