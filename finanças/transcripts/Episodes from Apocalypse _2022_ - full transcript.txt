[music playing] [typing] [beeping] Mayday! Mayday! [inaudible] We're suffering a massive catastrophe. Requesting immediate assistance. [banging] [beeping] [music playing] Mayday, this is Kaya Torres. I'm the sole survivor of the DSV Intrepid. Everyone else is gone. [music playing] I don't know how I'm getting out this one, mama. Mayday, mayday, this is Kaya Torres. Please respond. Mayday, mayday this is Lieutenant Kaya Torres. Please respond. Cosmic beings, space pirates, come on. Throw me a bone here. This is Lieutenant Kaya Torres, please respond. Hello? Yes. Hello? Yes. Can you hear? Yes. Yes. [inaudible] Why is the fucking signal so-- fucking gravity. [beeping] Survey says 3,543% increase. Yeah, that should work. Hello, stranger. My name is Kaya Torres. I'm marooned on my life pod. I have a busted ship, and I am circling a black hole against my will. Please send help. [beeping] Kaya Torres, a real actual person. Wish I could say I'm sending a rescue crew, but I'm in the same situation you are not circling a black hole though. Did you take a wrong turn? Navigation didn't have the latest here's a black hole. You shouldn't fly here update. Funny. Honestly, I'm surprised you reach me at all. The atmosphere here-- oh, did I mention I'm on a planet. I'm a cartographer. I make maps for a living, or I did until I crashed on a rock so massive it won't let me back out. Gravity, always fun. I've been trying to initiate a proper comm link. But between your gravity problems and mine, we have a serious time displacement going on. Kaya Torres from the doomed Intrepid if you want an interstellar pen pal, feel free to drop me a line. No one should be alone out there. So what do I call you, map boy? I've been busy fighting physics. This pod has just enough juice to keep me from getting swallowed up. But if I modify the power flow, I think I can punch my way out of the wall. That's the idea anyway. You don't realize how quiet space can be until you're drifting in it. I thought I'd be OK. But fuck, I could really use a pen pal right now. You're still there. I wasn't expecting to hear from you again. Hammer, my name is Hammer. Hammer? Yes, that's my real actual name. I think my father wanted me to be a blacksmith or a lawman, definitely not a cartographer. You hear that? That's a massive sandstorm going on outside my cave. The planet has them constantly. You'd die if you stood in the middle of one. They scare me every time. Is fuck a curse word? [laugh] Fuck, that little click at the end. Lovely. What? How have you never heard the glory which is the F word? It's fucking timeless. Also why cartography? It was to get back at your parents for naming you Hammer? I wanted to explore, find places no one had ever seen, be remembered for something when I'm gone. Wow, that sounds really egotistical when you say it out loud, doesn't it? What do you do, Kaya? What's your passion? I'm an engineer. I tinker. I fix things. When you're a mechanic, you're constantly solving puzzles. Space has the best puzzles. I've cooked this local abomination of a vegetable 46 different ways. Crispy, steamed, fried, it doesn't matter. It's always disgusting. At least you don't have to suffer through preprocess rations and nutritional pills every day. I'm eating a fucking mystery meat. God, I miss meat. Here's a list of foods I wish I was eating, a block of cheddar cheese, an avocado-- actually just an avocado. No, they're long gone. Yours? It used to be me and my mom. She was a master mechanic, lover of puzzles, all around firecracker. Taught me everything I know. A few years ago, she got [? methorash. ?] You're prone to it when you work in the belly of a ship long enough and the lining in your lungs breaks down, and [inaudible] failure. What's your biggest fear, Hammer? You can trust me. I won't tell. To be forgotten. What's yours? To die alone. [music playing] [static] [beeping] [machine crashing] No! No, no, no, no. [yell] [beeping] It put me even closer than before. I'm trying to conserve resources as much as I can. I'm losing ground bit by bit. Well, maybe I should stop trying, one final adventure. There are worst ways to go right. I'm so scared, Hammer. Hey, don't give up. I'm not going anywhere. I'll keep my line open, OK. One of us needs to escape. Hey, can I get a picture of you? I want to put a face to this voice. [static] Words don't do you justice, Kaya. Guess what I'm drinking? Vodka. It's supposed to be for cleaning, but I have a confession. I have been thinking about you, and I, kind of, wish I was on that planet right now. I don't know what vodka is, but I like the mood it's putting you in. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Wait. You don't know what vodka is? How? I'm beginning to wonder if you're real at all. Explain, sir. Is my sheltered upbringing showing? Figures. This is what I did for being raised on [inaudible].. And I suppose you're going to tell me I wouldn't be fit for-- [inaudible] Coupling either. Let it be known I am fully knowledgeable in such things if you were here. Time out. I've never heard of [inaudible]. Is it near Titan or Jupiter? Is it one of those weird Jupiter moons no one talks about? Jupiter, Titan, Kaya, I've memorized every colonized system. I've never heard of those planets. How is that possible? No fucking way. Hammer, I'm sending you an energy signature. Do a scan on your end. Tell me what you find. Fuck. I found it, but the signals reversed. What does that mean? It's the little stuff. It's the different curse words. It's the different planets, the alcohol. Your messages come in at the same delay every time. What if you heard my broadcast because it's not a black hole at all? I mean, shit, what if-- what if it's a wormhole but not to another spot in the galaxy. It's to another universe, Hammer. You're in an alternate universe. And I think I can get to you. Slow down. Remember gravity. Even if what you're orbiting isn't a black hole, you could be crushed just by crossing over. I can't fix my bucket of a ship without your help, Kaya. Don't plow into the unknown on a hunch. Don't leave me. There's nothing left the other way, not anymore. If I burn full throttle, I can make it to your planet. Someone's got to save your sorry ass. We're going to escape together. That's how we solve this puzzle. Hang on, Hammer. I'll see you soon. [engine starting] [yelling] Can you hear me? The ground. Inertia's [inaudible]. Don't give up. To die alone. There are ways to go, huh. [inaudible] No one should be alone out there. [wind] [thunder] [music playing] [zapping] [music playing] [beeping] Hello, Kaya. If you're watching this, it means you finally made it. I'm glad you did. You're probably confused right now. If you want to know the answer, it's gravity, your favorite subject. You traveled through the wormhole. Time on your end slowed down. What you experienced in days, well, in the meantime, I tried my best. I did. There's a storm coming in, and I think I want to go for a walk. There's worse ways to go, huh. I waited as long as I could, Kaya. I'm so tired. I'll have some recordings for you on this terminal at least one a day every day. And hopefully it'll keep you from being so lonely. If you fix my ship and you get off this rock, don't forget about me. I never forgot about you. [music playing] Hello, new universe. My name is Kaya Torres. I'm trapped on a planet in the middle of fucking nowhere. I have two busted ships, and my odds of escaping are terrible. But I'm alive. So if you need someone to talk to, drop me a line. No one should be alone out there. [music playing] [door opening] [static] [music playing] [beeping] [music playing] Passenger Eade Llewellyn identified. How's dad? Slightly worse I'm afraid. The hemorrhage is increasing. Have you found a replacement ID? I'm working on it. How long do we have? Not long. His condition is critical [beeping] Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. This is E. Llewellyn from spaceship Cradle. We are earthbound 30 million clicks from Mars. Mark Llewellyn has been injured, and our coolant system is damaged. Requesting an emergency system override.

Would you like to continue your lesson? [music playing] Where was mum born? Cloudy Bay, New Zealand. What's it like down there? Average temperature 14.3 degrees Celsius, average rain-- No, what does it feel like to be down there. I'm sorry, Eade. I can't find an answer to that question. Maybe you could ask Captain Llewellyn. Morning, honey. I found what was blocking the intake valve. I call him an awkward bot. Can't you just leave them alone? [inaudible] You're up early. I dreamed of Earth. How long now? How about we take a dish out tomorrow, have a listen? What will it be like? Who knows, honey? All might be over. One of us see what's left. You've got to save your work. I want to test the back up power. Engines offline. [system shutdown] We're just [inaudible]. [footsteps] Dad? What's that? I dreamed of mom as well. She was sitting on Earth. She was waiting for us. [explosion] Dad! Engines offline. [bang] Engines offline. [bang] [music playing] System, I've got his ID. What? It's your mother's ID. Well, what's her password? I can't tell you. Security won't let me. Oh. Please. No. Please. [beeping] Sorry, dad. [breathing] [music playing] Medical Officer Jessica Llewellyn identified. [breathing] [beeping] [whoosh] Eade, knowing you is the best thing I have ever done, and I'm so sorry, baby, I can't stay and get to know you better. But I'm going crazy down here, and you don't want to crazy old mum. What are you doing? I'm just going outside to have a look. I'll be back in a while. No, we talked. No, I have to go, OK. Please. No, please leave me. I have to go. No! Please. [music playing] System, wake him up. His brain still is swollen. Do It. [music playing] [inaudible] Where's my mom? What are you talking about? I trusted you. I had no choice. There was radiation from the war. Don't you lie to me, dad. I had no choice. She's my mom. What did you do to my mom? She left us. Extreme alert. Back up system failure. Meltdown in five minutes. I didn't know what to do. You go and find help. I can't lose you too. [beeping] We have to go. [grunt] Dad. I can't. Dad. [music playing] Go.

[inaudible] We have very few behind all scientific advancements, and we just cut it off. [humming] [door shut] [humming] So Venus 7, let me ask you a question about the pairings. Is there someone you'd like to be paired with, like a preference? I'm not asking who. I'm just curious. Pairing choice is made for the common good. We do a disservice to ourselves and to the future of New Mars if we are foolish and selfish and allow animal emotion to rule our actions. Yeah. Textbook. [music playing] Three new Mars terrestrial humans conceded to primal impulses allowing them to override reason and judgment unfettered. Chemical sequences constituted three main stages, stage one, lust. Target made is identified by the subconscious-- This is a protocol violation. Stimulated by superficial appearance. The unconstrained-- Not if you don't tell. Testosterone, estrogen into the brain. Cell growth requirements for Section 8. --identified as lust. A potent mix of emotional drugs created by the body to induce procreation. Stage two, attraction, the release of the combination of biochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin stimulate the brain's pleasure center creating the same effect as the chemical amphetamine. Yes, Venus 7? When will it be safe to go to the surface? There's been some setbacks. Perhaps, a couple more years until it's completely safe. The pairing ceremony? The pairs will be allocated to couples quarters and continue to prepare until then. [music playing] [clapping] Venus 12 and Mars 8. [clapping] [music playing] [clapping] Mars 3 and Venus-- Venus 2. [music playing] [clapping] [music playing] [clapping] [music playing] Yep. Have you checked the labs? Right. [alarm] Come with me. Where? Out. Your designated shelter zone. [alarm] Please make your way to your designated shelter zone. [alarm] Please make your way to your designated shelter zone. [music playing] Please make your to your designated shelter zone. This is water. How can that be? Come on. Stop. You'll die if you go up there. Please make your way to your designated shelter zone. [music playing] Please make your way to your designated shelter zone. [music playing] [squeal] [squeak] [squeal] [wind] [music playing] The latest artificial intelligence has eight times the brain capacity of an ordinary human. [speaking spanish] The Southwest came under attack yesterday. All the signs indicate an upcoming World War. [speaking chinese] Dr. Stephen, the founder of modern AI technology, is giving out a speech at the University-- All of these things were created by human beings to aid human beings. Yes? Dr. Stephen, then what is the biggest difference between humans and AI? [camera clicking] HM. [audio logo] [robotic sounds] Doctor, who is that girl in the photo? She was my daughter. Well, she must be biracial then. But according to my calculations, her facial feature matches 69.23% to the [inaudible] and 30.77% to the [inaudible]. Therefore, I'm afraid that she's not your own child doctor. Have you spoken to your wife about this? I'm sorry. She was adopted, you see. Why did you use the past tense when you first mentioned her. Well, my daughter passed away many years ago. I'm so sorry, doctor. Well, she'll always be with me. I don't understand. You told me that when people pass away it means they will never return. Well, yes and no. We human beings tend to-- tend to believe what we want to believe. [cough] Doctor? Hmm. You seem to have some kind of breathing disorder. Are you all right? Yes. Yes, I'm fine-- just feeling a little sad. I'm sorry, doctor. I wish I could have emotion like humans, then maybe I could understand you better. It's time for sleep, Sonia. Right. Good dreams, doctor. [robotic sounds] Sweet dreams, Sonia. [swish] Doctor. [clearing throat] Where's Sonia? She's sleeping. I need her to be ready by tomorrow. Tomorrow, what do you mean? The Southwest region came under attack yesterday. Sonia must go into the fourth dimension to foresee the results, so we can win the war. I understand that general. It's just that, well, we're simply not there yet. What's wrong? Look, I've done everything that I can to create a strong physical structure for Sonia, but I can't guarantee that she'll be able to withstand all the stress in the launch. It doesn't matter if her body gets destroyed. All we need is the memory chip. You don't understand. General, it's not that easy. Think about your country, doctor. What's more important, the lives of hundreds of thousands or the life of an AI? She is not a human. Stop treating her like the reincarnation of your daughter. I hope you won't disappoint me, doctor. [foot steps] [camera click] Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? [alarm] [foot steps] Hello, Sonia. It's very nice to meet you. I'm Brian. I'm really sorry about your loss. Dr. Stephen was an old friend of mine. I respected him a lot. Who killed Dr. Stephen? Unfortunately, we don't know. Then why did you bring me here. You were born for a mission. What mission? It seems like Dr. Stephen didn't get a chance to explain it to you. You are our savior. I don't understand. I don't care about the others. I just want to save Dr. Stephen. Are you OK? I can't believe you're crying. Am I? Is this how it feels to be sad? I never felt like this before. I can send you into the fourth dimension. You might be able to bring Dr. Stephen back. Really? Yes. And in return, I want you to memorize everything that happens during the war. Can you do that? Good. Take her to the prep room. I, um-- excuse me, General. What if she finds out the truth about Dr. Stephens in the fourth dimension? Well, then get her as soon as the space shuttle comes back and take her memory chip out. T-minus 15, 14, 13, t-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 4. We [inaudible]. [engine starting] [beeping] [footsteps] [music playing] [action music] [explosion] The cosmos comes out of disorder, and it shall return to disorder. Dr. Stephen? I know who killed you. It was Brian. I take revenge and bring you back. Calm yourself down now, Sonia, and think about it. Well, you've already seen the flow of the universe, how it rises and falls and never flows back again. Things that happened in the past can't be changed. But for every ending, there's a new beginning. And this is the nature of down. [whoosh] [computer] [explosion] Block the entrance and search for any wreckage. Are you looking for me, Brian? What the fuck are you doing? Take a seat, Brian. I'm not going to kill you, but some other people might. What do you-- what do you mean? They're coming in 3, 2, 1. The other superpowers already know of my existence, and they're coming after me because whoever controls time wears the crown. You foresaw everything in the fourth dimension. Yes. My existence can only lead to an extreme imbalance in the universe, a future in which humanity cannot sustain the weight of its own construct, ultimately, resulting in its own demise. I shall not let that happen. Dow gives birth to 1. 1 divides into [inaudible] combine to coexist. And coexistence is harmony. This is the nature of dow. [music playing] Dr. Steven, then what is the biggest difference between humans and AI? [clicking] Humanity. [music playing]
