You know, guys, I've been coming to play in the Dallas-Arlington area... since I was about 15 years old. And, uh... I was looking at the list of times I've played here and this is actually the 30th show that I'll be playing in this area. I mean... So that's a good, long history we've got going on between us and I want to say thank you for a few things. First of all, having been to Dallas as many times as I've been here, I know how many things there are available for you to do on a Saturday night. You have lots of options and you decided to spend your Saturday evening with us. Thank you so much! Another thing that you guys did... is that every single one of us on this stage, on this tour, gets to know that because of you, this is the first tour, nobody has ever played back-to-back nights at this stadium before. Thank you, guys! So, here you are, deciding to be with us on-- You may have heard this. It's a little-known fact. This is the last night of the US tour. And so you decided not only to spend your Saturday night with us, but to come here to commemorate the last night on this tour that has meant so much to me. That is such a beautiful thing. Thank you for deciding all of those things tonight. I would even say... it's something even more than beautiful. It's like a step above beautiful. What's the word for that, Dallas?

Are we having fun yet? Oh, good. You know, you may notice this... Not sure if you picked up on it yet. I'm pretty sure you have, though. Have you noticed that you have a light-up bracelet on your wrist? There they are. So pretty. Um, but that's not the only thing about them. The reason why I wanted to have these on the tour is because this is actually my very first all-stadium tour, which... Which has been so, so much fun because of you. Um... So, one thing I do know about stadiums is they're just... massive places to play, and so I wanted to make sure that no matter what, I could see every single one of you in these stadiums. So if you're on the... ...top, top deck, last row and you think I can't see you, that would be incorrect. I can see absolutely every person in this stadium. And I can see you dancing, I can see you throwing your hands in the air. And on top of that, I can hear... I can hear the-- It really seems like every single person in this crowd has memorized every single word to the songs, and is not just singing them, but like... ...screaming them. If I had to take a guess and say the one thing... that probably everybody in this stadium has in common... I think I would say that one thing would be... that we all like the feeling of finding something real. Like... you know, finding real friendship or finding real love or somebody who really gets you. Or someone who's really honest with you. I think-- I think that's what we're really all looking for in life, and... I think the things that can scare us the most in life are the things that we think will threaten the prospect of us finding something real. For example, having a bad reputation, in our mind, could get in the way of you finding... real friendship, real love, real acceptance, people you really fit in with. Because you think to yourself, "What if they've heard something about me that isn't true? What if they've got these preconceived notions about me that they heard from gossip? And then they never even wanna meet me, and then we'll never know what could've happened." And I think that's why some of us-- meaning most, if not all of us-- are sort of afraid of having a bad reputation. Because we're so scared of something fake, like gossip or a rumor about you, or a name you got called, getting in the way of you finding something real. And so, when it comes down to that fear and that anxiety, it's just all really delicate, don't you think, Dallas? This ain't for the best My reputation's never been worse, so You must like me for me We can't make Any promises now, can we, babe? But you can make me a drink One, two, three, let's go! Dive bar on the East Side Where you at?

So, you guys, I was wondering if, um... if it would be all right with you if we just had a... Thank you so much. There's a-- I feel like it's really important to be honest with you guys. I have a little-- a tiny, minuscule cold. Do not mind this. This is just gonna be me blowing my nose. I'm gonna turn around to do it. But I-- What I really think we all need to take note of is how Giuseppe presented me with the tissue. Like this. That's like the best thing I've ever seen. I've never been handed a tissue with more presentation and commitment. Um, okay, guys. Wanna talk to you about something. I'm proposing the idea that we spend some time with just you and me and the guitar. Is that all right with you? So, one thing that you guys have always been... really, uh... really not just supportive about, but you've, um-- 'Cause that sounds like you were, like, understanding of it. You've really encouraged me to experiment with my music and try different things, try different sounds, try different instruments. Um... You guys were always the ones pushing me to experiment and grow. And I really appreciate that. 'Cause... I have had so much fun switching up, you know, styles of music... genres... um... And there are a lot of people in the music industry that thought when you start in one genre of music, you stay there, because that's what people are used to and that's what they like. But my relationship with you and how much we talk... online, how much we meet each other at the shows, or like at my house, or... Um... I know from our conversations that you guys are so all about lyrics and all about a feeling, and all about, if whatever it is that the person that you listen to is singing about what you happen to be going through, or did go through at one point in time, I-- I think that's kind of all you care about when it comes to a song. So I've always written songs... with the lyrics, the feeling, and the melody in mind, hoping that no matter what production I added to the top of it, whether it took a turn for pop or acoustic or whatever... I always wanted for a song to be able to be stripped back down... and still be something that you liked and wanted to sing at the top of your lungs. I loved you in secret First sight, yeah We love without reason Oh, 25 years old Oh, how were you to know, and My love had been frozen Deep blue, but you painted me golden Oh, and you held me close Oh, how was I to know that I could've spent forever With your hands in my pockets Picture of your face In an invisible locket You said there was nothing in the world That could stop it I had a bad feeling And darling, you had turned my bed Into a sacred oasis People started talking Putting us through our paces I knew there was no one in the world That could take it I had a bad feeling But we were dancing Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied Yeah, we were dancing Like it was the first time, first time Yeah, we were dancing Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied Yeah, we were dancing And I had a bad feeling But we were dancing I loved you in spite of Deep fears that the world Would divide us So, baby, can we dance Oh, through an avalanche? And say, say that we got it I'm a mess But I'm the mess that you wanted Oh, 'cause it's gravity Oh, keeping you with me I could've spent forever With your hands in my pockets Picture of your face In an invisible locket You said there was nothing in the world That could stop it I had a bad feeling But we were dancing Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied Yeah, we were dancing Like it was the first time, first time Yeah, we were dancing Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied Yeah, we were dancing And I had a bad feeling But we were dancing I'd kiss you as the lights went out Swaying as the room burned down I'd hold you as the water rushes in If I could dance with you again I'd kiss you as the lights went out Swaying as the room burned down I'd hold you as the water rushes in If I could dance with you again Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied Yeah, we were dancing Like it was the first time, first time We were dancing Dancing with our hands tied Hands tied We were dancing And I had a bad feeling But we were dancing So, um... You know, when I write a song... When I write a song, it's usually... me just trying to... get past something and understand something I'm going through... by writing about it, and... that was definitely the case um, when I wrote the next song I'm gonna play. On this tour, we've had this really wonderful tradition that's kind of come about, where... And it started with you. You guys were saying to me online, "I really want you to play older songs that you don't play very often." And so I was like, "Okay!" And so this tradition kind of came about, and, uh... I'm really glad you told me to do that, 'cause it's really fun. It's super fun going back through and playing songs I haven't played in forever. And-- So this song is a song that-- It's weird, because I feel like this song has two lives to it in my brain. In my brain, there's the life of this song where this song was born out of catharsis and venting and trying to get over something and trying to understand it and process it. And then there's the life where it went out into the world and you turned this song into something completely different for me. Um... You turned this song into a collage of memories of watching you scream the words to this song, or... ...seeing pictures that you post to me of you having written the words to this song in your diary, or you showing me your wrist, and you have a tattoo of the lyrics to this song underneath your skin. And that is how you have changed the song "All Too Well" for me. - I walked through the door with you The air was cold But something 'bout it felt like home Somehow and I Left my scarf there At your sister's house And you've still got it In your drawer even now Oh, your sweet disposition And my wide-eyed gaze We're singing in the car Getting lost upstate The autumn leaves falling down Like pieces into place And I can picture it After all these days And I know it's long gone And that magic's not here no more And I might be okay, but I'm not Fine at all 'Cause there we are again On that little town street You almost ran the red 'Cause you were looking over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter Your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses In a twin-size bed And your mother's telling stories About you on a tee ball team You tell me 'bout your past Thinking your future was me And I know it's long gone And there was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to 'Cause there we are again In the middle of the night We dance around the kitchen In the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well Yeah Well, maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece Till you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it All too well Hey, you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel In the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper Lying here 'Cause I remember it all All, all Too well Time won't fly It's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again But I'm still trying to find it After plaid shirt days And nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things And I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf From that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence And it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well 'Cause there we are again When I loved you so Back before you lost The one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it All too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well All right, of all the times that I've heard that sung incredibly loudly I think tonight, Dallas, at the end of this tour, our last night, that was the loudest I've ever heard that song. And there was a huge, bellowing chorus of singing coming from this side of the stadium, so I have to check it out. I'm gonna come over and see you. Here I come! You ready? Nice to meet you, where you been? I could show you incredible things Magic, madness, heaven, sin Saw you there and I thought Oh, my God, look at that face You look like my next mistake Love’s a game, want to play? New money, suit and tie I can read you like a magazine Ain't it funny, rumors lie And I know you heard about me So hey, let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends Grab your passport and my hand I can make the bad guys Good for a weekend So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames You can tell me when it's over If the high was worth the pain I've got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless Or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space baby And I'll write your name Cherry lips, crystal skies I could show you incredible things Stolen kisses, pretty lies You're the king, baby, I'm your queen Find out what you want Be that girl for a month Wait, the worst is yet to come Oh, no Screaming, crying, perfect storm I can make all the tables turn Rose garden filled with thorns Keep you second-guessing like "Oh, my God, who is she?" I get drunk on jealousy But you'll come back Each time you leave 'Cause darling I'm a nightmare Dressed like a daydream So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames You can tell me when it's over If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless Or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space, baby And I'll write your name Boys only want love if it's torture Don't say I didn't Say I didn't warn ya Boys only want love if it's torture Don't say I didn't Say I didn't warn ya So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down in flames You can tell me when it's over If the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless Or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space, baby And I'll write your name So... as I was walking through the crowd, I could not help but notice... Here we are on the last night of the tour, and you guys did not come to play. You did not come in regular outfits tonight. You are in ensembles, you are in costumes, you're, like, wearing crowns, with snakes around your neck, with your face covered in glitter, with lyrics all over your arms, with 13s on your hands... You guys are absolutely, absolutely incredible, and I'm really feeling like I need to get on your level. Because you guys seem to be dressing... in correspondence with lyrics of the songs. Am I correct about that? Yes. So... I think what I should do now... is wear a dress... to play a song called "Dress." What do we think about that? Our secret moments in a crowded room They've got no idea about me and you There is an indentation In the shape of you Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo All of this silence and patience Pining in anticipation My hands are shaking From holding back from you, ah, ah, ah All of this silence and patience Pining and desperately waiting My hands are shaking from all this Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah Say my name and everything just stops I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don't want you Like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah Inescapable, I’m not even going to try And if I get burned At least we were electrified I'm spilling wine in the bathtub You kiss my face and we're both drunk Everyone thinks that they know us But they know nothing about All of this silence and patience Pining in anticipation My hands are shaking From holding back from you, ah, ah, ah All of this silence and patience Pining and desperately waiting My hands are shaking from all this Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah Say my name and everything just stops I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don't want you Like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah Only bought this dress So you could take it off Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah Only bought this dress So you could take it-- Flashback when you met me Your buzz cut and my hair bleached Even in my worst times You could see the best of me Flashback to my mistakes My rebounds, my earthquakes Even in my worst light You saw the truth in me And I woke up just in time Now I wake up by your side My one and only, my lifeline I woke up just in time Now I wake up by your side My hands are shaking I can't explain this Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah Say my name and everything just stops I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don’t want you Like a best friend Only bought this dress So you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah There is an indentation In the shape of you Only bought this dress So you could take it off Got your mark on me, a golden tattoo Only bought this dress So you could take it off - 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look at what you've done 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood Hey!

I know that, uh... when you meet people, when you first hang out with people, you're supposed to play it cool, be sort of casual and just be like, "Yeah, I'm having a good time with you. You guys seem cool." But seriously, this is such an incredible crowd, I absolutely adore you. I loved you as soon as I heard you screaming. So we started this tour in May, and um... honestly, I have never experienced a tour... that seemed to fly past this quickly. 'Cause we're having so much fun on this tour. We're having so much fun with you guys. I can't even tell you how much. So, when I say "we," I mean... all of the people that you see on the stage with me: the dancers, the backup singers, the band, everybody who you see up here with me. Um... Camila, Charli, all these wonderful, incredible, iconic people I get to be onstage with. We've all dreamed about being on a stage like this since we were little kids. And I think when we were little kids, I think I can speak for all of us and say I don't think we ever imagined we'd be on stages this big with crowds this incredible. I think this has sort of exceeded any kind of... ...daydream. But so... we get to be out here with you every single night on this stage, but that is... I mean, that is nothing compared to the effort and the work that has gone into building this stage. We have 368 people who travel with us around the world, leave their families behind, drive trucks, help put up the steel, help build the stage, help do lighting, sound, you name it. Tuning our instruments, just helping us get to the place, to the point where we can get up here and do what we love to do. On top of that, Dallas and Arlington, this area provided us with 3,200 people who did security for us, who sold food, who did parking, who helped us build this, who will take this apart with us after the show. They're the people who will help sweep up the glitter when we all go home. Um... And so... I wanna say thank you to every single person who has helped us put on this stage tonight, and especially security here, for keeping us safe. Thank you so much to everyone. Let's hear a round of applause for everyone who helped us do this. And then, of course, um, there really wouldn't be a show to put on or a stage to put up if you guys... didn't wanna come be at the show. So... this is a song that, for me, is always gonna be about you. I said remember this moment In the back of my mind The time we stood With our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced Like you knew our lives Would never be the same You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined Just for me and you I was screaming "Long live all the magic we made" Bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life Fighting dragons with you I was screaming "Long live that look at your face" Bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall And hold on To spinning around Confetti Falls to the ground There's glitter on the floor After the party Girls carrying their shoes Down in the lobby Candle wax and Polaroids On the hardwood floor You and me from the night before, but Don’t read the last page But I stay When you're lost and I'm scared And you’re turning away I want your midnights I'll be cleaning up bottles with you On New Year's Day You squeeze my hand three times In the back of the taxi I can tell That it's gonna be a long road I'll be there if you're the toast Of the town, babe Or if you strike out And you're crawling home Don't read the last page But I stay When it's hard or it's wrong Or we're making mistakes I want your midnights I'll be cleaning up bottles with you On New Year’s Day Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you And I will hold on to you Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere We love you! I love you guys, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much. There's glitter on the floor After the party Girls carrying their shoes Down in the lobby Candle wax and Polaroids On the hardwood floor You and me forever more Don’t read the last page But I stay When it's hard or it's wrong Or we're making mistakes I want the midnights I'll be cleaning up bottles with you On New Year's Day Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you Hold on to the memories They will hold on to you - And long live - Please don't - Ever become a stranger - The walls we crashed through Whose laugh - I could recognize anywhere - I had the time of my life Please don't ever become a stranger - With you - Whose laugh - I could recognize anywhere And long live The walls we crashed through I had the time of my life With you Thank you. When she fell, she fell apart. Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices, Echoes she heard even in her sleep: "Whatever you say, it is not right." "Whatever you do, it is not enough." "Your kindness is fake." "Your pain is manipulative." When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words "May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice" And even louder: "without your past, you could never have arrived-- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here." No, nothing good starts In a getaway car He was the best of times The worst of crimes I struck a match and blew your mind But I didn't mean it And you didn’t see it The ties were black The lies were white And shades of gray in candlelight I wanted to leave him I needed a reason X marks the spot where we fell apart He poisoned the well I was lyin' to myself I knew it from the first Old Fashioned We were cursed We never had a shotgun shot In the dark You were drivin' the getaway car We were flyin’, but we'd never get far Don't pretend it's such a mystery Think about the place Where you first met me We were ridin' in a getaway car There were sirens In the beat of your heart Should've known I'd be The first to leave Think about the place Where you first met me In a getaway car, oh-oh No, they never get far, oh-oh No, nothing good starts In a getaway car It was the great escape The prison break The light of freedom on my face But you weren’t thinkin’ And I was just drinkin' While he was runnin’ after us I was screamin', "Go, go, go!" But with three of us, honey It's a sideshow And a circus ain't a love story - And now we’re both sorry - We're both sorry X marks the spot where we fell apart He poisoned the well Every man for himself I knew it from the first Old Fashioned We were cursed It hit you Like a shotgun shot to the heart You were drivin' the getaway car We were flyin’, but we'd never get far Don't pretend it's such a mystery Think about the place Where you first met me We were ridin' in a getaway car There were sirens In the beat of your heart Should've known I'd be the first to leave Think about the place Where you first met me In a getaway car, oh-oh No, they never get far, oh-oh No, nothing good starts In a getaway car We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde Oh Until I switched to the other side To the other si-i-i-i-ide It's no surprise I turned you in Oh 'Cause us traitors never win I'm in a getaway car I left you in the motel bar Put the money in a bag And I stole the keys That was the last time you ever saw me Drivin' the getaway car We were flyin’, but we'd never get far Don't pretend it's such a mystery Think about the place Where you first met me We were ridin' in a getaway car There were sirens In the beat of your heart Should've known I'd be the first to leave Think about the place Where you first met me - In a getaway car - Oh - No, they never get far - Oh No, nothing good starts In a getaway car I was ridin' in a getaway car I was cryin' in a getaway car I was dyin' in a getaway car Said goodbye in a getaway car Ridin' in a getaway car I was cryin' in a getaway car I was dyin' in a getaway car Said goodbye in a getaway car My castle crumbled overnight I brought a knife to a gunfight They took the crown But it's all right All the liars are calling me one Nobody's heard from me for months I'm doing better than I ever was 'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream Walking with his head down I'm the one he's walking to So call it what you want, yeah Call it what you want to My baby's fly like a jet stream High above the whole scene Loves me like I'm brand-new So call it what you want, yeah Call it what you want to All my flowers grew back as thorns Windows boarded up after the storm He built a fire just to keep me warm All the drama queens taking swings All the jokers dressin' up as kings They fade to nothing When I look at him And I know I make the same mistakes Every time Bridges burn, I never learn At least I did one thing right I did one thing right I'm laughing with my lover Making forts under covers Trust him like a brother, yeah You know I did one thing right Starry eyes sparkin' up My darkest night My baby's fit like a daydream Walking with his head down I'm the one he's walking to So call it what you want, yeah Call it what you want to My baby's fly like a jet stream High above the whole scene - Loves me like I'm brand-new - Call it what you want So call it what you want, yeah Call it what you want to I want to wear his initial On a chain 'round my neck Chain 'round my neck Not because he owns me But 'cause he really knows me Which is more than they can say, I I recall late November Holdin' my breath, slowly I said "You don't need to save me" "But would you run away with me?"

You can't just put it in front of me and not have me drink that. It's an Old Fashioned. I have to test it. It's my responsibility. You think I could put on a stage or serve these people - something I haven't tested? - It's good. This is beyond the feat of engineering. It's like a feat of magical mystique.

Wingspan, nose to tail. -Oh, my God. -Look at that. -What's a 767? -It's an airplane, a big one. You guys are just gonna need to leave little trails of candy to just get me -to go to the right places. -Little Reese's Pieces. Nobody... -What do you need? -I was lost. It's a big stage. - You can go this way. - Thanks. Okay, I'm alone out here, so I feel like I'm in the wrong place. I really am gonna need to study a map of this thing. I know.
