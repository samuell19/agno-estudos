Subtitles by explosiveskull I Citizen-General Zakarian, address you as a leader of the United Kingdom Liberation Army. This morning, martial law was imposed upon our nation after His Majesty's government was declared unfit to rule. This after decades of corruption, greed, xenophobia and racism. Yet your freedoms diminish further. Oppressed by an unelected military council interested only in power and your subjugation. It is we, the UKLA, who started this revolution. We, the UKLA militia, who fight for the freedom of the British people. We, the UKLA's blood, that stains Britain's green and pleasant land. My fellow countrymen, you have my word. This regime will burn and from its ashes, our nation which once led the world will rise again. This is a declaration of war. Hey! Hey. Is anyone out there? Okay... Okay... Hungry? Sorry? Are you hungry? Take it. No. The wrapper is sealed. Theres nothing in there that shouldn't be. Nuts? Not a trace. Hows your head? Who are you? Has the bleeding stopped? What have you done to me? How about you stop answering questions with questions? What do you remember? I remember... I was... hand-delivering a document. What document? I don't know, I was just delivering it. What's your name? My name is Ruth. I'm an admin girl. I handle deliveries. I transfer calls. I make coffee runs. So you know where you are? Are we still in the facility? I've only been here two months! They keep us on bi-monthly cycles. Are you still there? I don't know why you put me in this thing or who told you to put me in here... It's getting quite hot in here. Do you know what wet-bulb temperature is? It's a combined measure of dry temperature and humidity. The highest wet-bulb temperature ever recorded was 33 degrees Celsius. That's what you're feeling now. What do you want? Answers, Ruth. Answers about what was going on here. You okay? Do you need some help? You're pretty calm and collected for a mail girl. I'm under no illusions. You're the one in control here. Hm. I need more convincing. What do you mean? You need to keep moving, Ruth! It's so cold... Hypothermia! Take off those wet clothes! Your resolve is admirable... but the purpose of this chamber is to break that resolve, isn't it? Can you dry these? Surely you could just turn the temperature up in that bit of the room or something? I prefer you like this. Pervert. What have you got to hide? Nothing! I see that now. Drop them in there. I'll get them dried for you. That was quite a fight you put up at minus 15 degrees Celsius. I'd be dead now if I hadn't started moving. What would you have done then? Moved on. You don't seem very useful. So what are those 2 tattoos on your wrist? Just thought they were pretty. How can you see me so well? Are my clothes ready? I'm not hungry. Take it, Ruth. No. You animal. Ruth. Take it or Ill make you wish I'd let you freeze to death. What have you done?! Why are you doing this?! You see, I'm not afraid to get primitive. Put it back now. What the fuck was going on here?! I told you, I don't know. I'm just an admin girl! I don't know what goes on here, it's miles above my pay grade! If you know nothing, you're of no use to me. Stop! Stop! I'll talk! I'll talk! I'll talk! Talk then! Let me see your face first. I want to see who I'm talking to. I didn't realize you were calling the shots all of a sudden! I'm not saying that... I'm not saying that. What's your objection anyway? Citizen-General Zakarian... Our reputation precedes us. What's it like out there? Carnage. Now give me the answers you promised. Rumors were, they were working on something big for the war effort. What could they possibly... But nothing more ever trickled down from the top. Well, no matter. They're going to need it. We have control of the North and most of the southern counties. I've seen your speeches. Your calls to arms claiming to fight for the good of the people. You've made this country a war zone. You've killed innocent people in bomb attacks! You're a butcher who uses kamikaze tactics with no regard for the lives of his own men! Such rhetoric they spin you. Why would so many join such a man? We need to stand together, not kill each other. Stand together? This country's rotting! Families are starving because there are no jobs. Thousands have died without healthcare! And having a foreign name marks you for persecution. Intervention was imperative and we've done what we needed to do. Because only the aggressive are heard these days. Zakarian! Come back! Zakarian! We found your food storage room. The size of it! Makes sense that you were here for months at a time. I have a question. All the people that you've killed, how do you reconcile taking their lives? In your own mind? It hurts every time. To take the life of a fellow countryman. A fellow human being. But they've made themselves my enemy and that means, it's me or them. I have enough belief in my cause to justify my life over theirs. You agree with me! No. No. Just light on sleep. Where are you from? I'm British. Same as you. You know what I mean. Zakarian. What is that? Armenian? Iranian? Kurdish. I see. Look, just because were on different sides doesn't mean... What were you doing here for the National Security Council? Administration. That's all. We have run out of time for you to lie to me. I told you the one thing I'd heard. Sir! Doctor Chrysler. The facilities Head Weaponry Engineer. What about him? In fact, the document I was delivering was for him, before I got knocked out. Oh, it was for Chrysler, was it? So he was leading this big project you speak of? Can't have been this chamber alone. I think you know more. Electricity. The great emancipator of men. Chilean dictator, General Pinochet, would strap his enemies to a parrilla. A metal frame pumped with high voltage, shocking them over and over. I guess you could say, you are now walking on one big parrilla. Had enough? Go to the glass. I cant... Zakarian... I can't, Zakarian... I can't! I said, go to the glass. What's happened to her?! This is human cruelty incarnate. The reality of this country's regime. What now, Zakarian? Huh? What more? I have nothing. I literally have nothing. I'm no good to you! Ah! Our new assistant. Welcome. Thank you. Uh... Uh, no ID cards in this wing. The guards make sure were the only ones allowed in or out. I'm Ed. Hi, Ed. Sandra's just setting up the chemical work station. Oh. Hi, Sandra. And... - Your name? - Oh! Sorry. I wasn't sure if you wanted to know. Were not machines, my dear. I'm Ruth. Good morning, Ruth. I'll be right down. Doctor Elle Chrysler. An honor! Have you been handling nuts? Uh, yes. In my hand cream. You should have been told. All of you just meet me on the lower level. We'll go via the bathroom. Wash your hands thoroughly. Come on. This is the final task of your bi-monthly rotation. As ever, your country thanks you for your service in this time of desperate need. Today we welcome Ruth to our team. In the space of a few months, Ruth has gone from admin girl to the brightest brain in our chemical engineering development team. She will be assisting us over the coming days. Welcome to the Principal Wing. Thank you, Doctor Chrysler. You know the protocol. No communication with the outside world during the testing period. Once it has concluded, it never happened. There will be no record of our work or even presence here. Your loyalty and commitment must be absolute. Any information leak can and will be traced back to you. On pain of death, you must say and do whatever you have to, to protect our work. Become someone else if need be. Very good. You may return to your work stations. Doctor Chrysler. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. Are you prepared? - Sorry? - For what ever lies ahead. Are you prepared for it? Yes, Doctor. Of course. I'm here to prove myself. You have received little information about our task for good reason. Vocal alteration, please. You're awake, Zakarian. Good morning. Is it morning? It is. Early morning in fact. The guys before you didn't let me see the sun either. So what is this? Welcome to the White Chamber. White Chamber. Well, for the millionth time, if you want some information, I have none. We aren't interrogators. You've been given to us for a very different purpose. You going to speak in riddles all day, mate? Mate? Miss? Cant really tell with the sci-fi voice. You're here to help us develop a new weapon in the war effort. Against my own forces? Are you stupid? When you're down there, never let him see your face. Could I get a deodorant or something? I forgot to pack a change of clothes. Got me wearing this stupid shit. Hey! Anybody in there? Huh? Hello? What about a toilet? I'd hate to soil this gleaming White Chamber. Beautiful by the way. Well done. Would you like me to mute him? Not for now. And what's the deal with this metal floor? I like the little holes. Could I get a chair? Armchair would be preferable. A mattress? A nice throw rug? Maybe some socks... Cheers. That was lovely. Could you turn the lights down in here? Or are you guys old school? It's alright. I had the sleep deprivation training in the SAS. What about a little, um... Mind readers. You're worth far more to us alive, Zakarian. Do you have much to live for? More than you can imagine. You have my word. Compliments to the chef. I'm sure she slaved over this for hours! Dessert's next, yes? Oh, yeah! Woo, yeah! Come on! Let me out of here! Instantaneous absorption. Secretion of dopamine and norepinephrine have spiked already. You're showering him again, Doctor Chrysler? The water hitting his body is 2 degrees Celsius. Body temperature remains unchanged. All is normal. Anything? His nociceptors have been totally desensitized. His brain isn't registering the temperature change even though his skin is on the verge of first degree burns. Come on! Why'd you stop?! Turn the fucking water back on. Now! - Mute him, please. - Turn it back on! For Gods sake, you fuc... Watch him closely. How much did they disclose to you about what we do here, Ruth? They just said, military related chemical testing. Exactly. Follow me, please. This is Pervitin. A once legal form of methamphetamine used by Nazi soldiers in World War 2. It galvanized their front line, giving them the focus and impetus to charge into battle. Benzoylmethylecgonine. Cocaine. Hitler himself was a known exponent of this. Hallucinogenic mushrooms made Zulu warriors feel immortal when fighting the British in the Anglo-Zulu Wars of 1879. The Americans in the jungles of Vietnam used cannabis and heroin to cope with the hellish conditions. Brown-Brown. Used by child soldiers in Sierra Leone. You see, Ruth, drugs have been a tactic in warfare for centuries. We are to produce a new stimulant to help our troops defeat Zakarian's militia. A super-amphetamine, with minimal side effects. But something this sensitive and dangerous can only be achieved through rigorous trial and error. Which is what this is? That's what we built this chamber for. For scientific testing. For progress. This is where we are right now. Alphamethylidinoargentiophenone. We call it Argo on account of its silver color. Which is achieved how? Not actual silver surely? No, a harmless coloring agent. And his food was laced with this... Argo? Three point five grams. An eighth in street terms. On the insistence of the National security Council, he is our test subject. Is that alright, Ruth? Yes. This war needs to end. Whatever it takes. Excellent. Put these away please, Sandra. If you don't mind my asking, Doctor Chrysler. How did they capture Citizen-General Zakarian? I'm not privy to what goes in the field. We must carry out our task indiscriminate of who or what they are. Sandra will get you up to speed on the precise chemistry involved here. Thank you, Sandra. I'll get your protective clothing. Thirty years as a chemical engineer. You've got some stories to tell, I bet. Nothing worth recounting. Especially when one considers what we face now. I, uh... noticed Doctor Chryslers perfume. Her attention to detail is all encompassing. A well-scented woman exudes control. Unless they're masking the smell of fear. Sorry. I'll finish clearing up. Something wrong? This is Malusmercury. I didn't think it was real. How do you think our Prime Minister was assassinated? But no one was ever caught? It's a slow killer. Symptoms of poisoning didn't show for over a week. By then it was too late to save him or catch the perpetrator. So I suggest you hold that bottle with two hands or don't hold it at all. Well done today, Ruth. Your proficiency with chemicals is quite outstanding. Thank you... Sandra. I'm going to get a few hours rest. Wait here until someone comes to relieve you. - Of course. - They wont be long. There's a panic button in case of emergency. Got it. And I will inform the guards on my way out. I told you, he does not see your face! I... I'm sorry. I don't care how talented you are. One more gross neglect of protocol and you'll wish... Please just do as I say. It's very sensitive work were doing here. I'm sorry, Doctor Chrysler. It's just that the monitors upstairs aren't on so... So I... Hello, Zakarian. Wakey! Wakey! I'm still here! Oh Doctor, you need to join me. I've been sitting here making love to the wall. Have you noticed how white it is? It's so bright... He's still high? He should just be coming down. Longevity is good. Get back to work shortly. For what? I'm sorry? I just meant... alertness, energy, numbing of pain receptors. The current recipe seems to be exactly what were after? The tests will end when the Council are happy that the safest product has been produced. We can only ascertain what that is by trailing different batches. Correct? You may go to your sleeping quarters. Yes, Doctor Chrysler. Aren't you going to get some sleep? That's none of your concern. Somebody. Somebody talk to me. Talk to me, please! Anyone?! What kind of interrogation is this? Huh? You drugged me so I'd give you answers? You're wasting your time! God knows I've been wasting my own. Who else is in here? Are these your tactics? Is this your warfare? Huh? Well I'm a Zakarian and I fight for what I want! If you're not going to let me sleep... I'll do it myself! What the fuck? Breakfast time, Citizen-General Zakarian. You must think I'm a clown. Would you prefer it in pill form? Go fuck yourself! Those were the consensual options. Oh yeah? So what are you going to do now? Huh? Good morning. On the control pad today please, Ruth. But I haven't been trained? You haven't what? I should be right in assuming you deduced basic functionality by watching me over the past 24 hours. That's the impression I got last night. Basics, yes. Well it all follows logically from the basics. I'll talk you through today's tests. The smoke contains a batch of si50. Slightly modified and hopefully improved. Open the vents. Can you hear me, Zakarian? Oh yes, Doctor! Loud and clear! Good to see you so compliant. Well of course! Lie down on the floor. Oh Doctor, you haven't even bought me dinner yet. On the floor, please. See where a few manners get you? One milliampere of electrical current, please. So how long do you want me like this? Fifteen milliamperes. Oh, that tickled! Inhibition of nociceptors is still excellent. Fifty milliamperes. Amplified strength, thats what we were hoping for. Come on! Lets go! Impressive, Zakarian. Let's see how you handle 80 milliamperes. Be mindful, anything over 100 milliamperes will most likely cause organ damage. Shut it off. You can get up now, Citizen-General. Very good. Your pain threshold has increased exponentially. Next, your heart rate will speed up as a result of catalyzed secretion of... You're Doctor Chrysler, aren't you? Yeah! Yeah, we got intel on you. That you were brought in as Head Weaponry Engineer. So this is what you came up with? A torture chamber?! And were the ones portrayed as reprobates?! Should I mute him? - Look at yourselves in the mirror. - No. One hundred and one milliamperes. Answer me! Do it. Answer me! That's not fair! You should warn me first! Doctor Chrysler. Yeah, Doctor Chrysler, I just remembered something! That's enough from you, Zakarian! Rumors were that you only joined the battle after you lost one of your own to the war! That we killed him! Huh? I'm sure he was a stinking coward, just like you. Hit him again. Hiding behind this... I wish I knew if it was me. I wish I knew if it was me who killed him. Blew his brains out over the battlefield! He was just a number, you know! A means to a better end! We can end this test! No! Monsters! Did you disobey me again? How dare you?! I didn't! I promise! You're finished here. Do you understand what that means? Do you realize what will happen to you?! Eleanor! We got all we needed. But... Jamie... Thanks, Ed. I'm trying to give them up. Thanks, but I don't smoke. I bet you're a vegan as well. Why are you here, Ruth? Sorry? Why are you on our side and not theirs? It never crossed my mind, I guess. To join a rebel cause always takes a leap of faith. I was lucky. I had a great education. Was able to pursue my passion. My family are all safe. Everything that led up to this sort of passed me by... until it was too late. Do you want to know a secret? I've never even voted. All I know is... war isn't a solution for anything. I'm sorry about Eleanor. We try to leave our demons outside the facility but were helpless when they chase us in. Jamie wasn't just a number... he was my son. You're Doctor Edgar Chrysler! You created the Chamber. Eleanor and I. She was my assistant every step of the way. I protected her identity all these years. Now, I assist her. Then there was Jamie. He was... He was a wonderful boy. The free spirit of the family. Even so, he had no hesitation about conscripting for service. He got me this from Africa... our Jamie. Elle lost even more. Her husband David was also killed in battle. This war pulled away the two pillars in her life, but in opposite directions. Her husband fought for the UKLA? Civil wars divide allegiances, Ruth, even amongst family. Doctor Chrysler. Who's watching Zakarian? Everything is under control. Are there, um, any more tests planned for today? Am I a monster, Sandra? Most certainly not. You disagree with some of what you've seen, don't you? These... tests. I've never experienced anything like it before. What if I let him go? Would there be another way to achieve what were doing? Some way that doesn't reduce us to their level. Why Zakarian anyway? Isn't he more use to the Council as a bargaining chip? Would you rather we did these tests on a civilian? No... no, of course not. I would have once asked myself the same question. Until the Coronation Day bombings when the UKLA took my entire family away from me. Just like they've taken from you. Without remorse. There is no right and wrong in war, Ruth. No good and evil. Just a difference in perception. It's a great shame what happened to David, but because of David, you know Zakarian. They revel in our loss in their crusade. Zakarian promised to rejuvenate democracy. Empower the neglected. So neglected were they, they turned to a war-monger. The White Chamber is where that animal belongs. We cannot let our country fall into the hands of him and his kind. Violence is the only language people speak now. We have no choice but to learn it ourselves. Continue to monitor the subject. As you wish, Doctor. They're getting closer. Where did you go? Just a walk. Help, he's begging for help! Please! What's happening in there? His body temperature is rising... a lot. Help me! Get it out of me! It'll pass. Please! Help! We'll sort that out in the next batch. Where's Doctor Chrysler? The National Security Council asked to see her. It's time to feed him. No. He can wait. We need to clear his system for the next batch. Go ahead, Ruth. Voice alteration is on. How are you feeling? Like boiled crap. Why? Am I looking good? You're having withdrawal symptoms. I'm going to give you a meal. You haven't eaten in 24 hours. Well could you... could you season the grub with a ton of that junkie stuff, please? Please! Is it in there? Don't worry. The pain will pass. You sound like Chrysler but you're not him are you? What's your name? My name doesn't matter. I just wanted to feed you. The National Security Council have informed me that they've sent over a new test subject. We were after a female weren't we, Sandra? You may return upstairs, Ruth. Anya. Daran. God, how did they get you? I asked you to run. I guess I'm not good at listening to your orders. I can't... Stop. Anya, they will come for us, I am a Zakarian! - A Zakarian who was about to abandon his comrades. - No. No, we built this rebellion on honor. They will not forget me. Their brother. Their blood. I love you so much. Anya, we will get out of here. I promise you. We will get out of here and we will run far, far away. That's very sweet, but we have use for both of you yet. If you do anything to her, I will kill you, I swear! What are they talking about, Daran? What is this place? Anya, come to me. Anya! Come to me. We will be fine. We will survive. Look at me. Anya... Anya. Anya, baby. Oh. No. Oh no. What's wrong, baby? I feel great. This is... I've never felt anything like this before. Imagine what fucking on this would be like. Dopamine, norepinephrine and adrenaline levels have all spiked, just as Zakarian's did. Let's test her pain threshold. Anya! Anya! Leave her alone! Do whatever you want to me but leave her alone! What's up? Anya. Anya! Acid?! Why not just use hot water like with Zakarian? Ruth, please. But if anything, it's... it's poor experiment practice. There are now two independent variables instead of one. But these are not experiments. These are chemical tests and testing is the assessment of the presence, genuineness or quality of a product. What are you doing?! You're just destroying us for sport now?! I'm going to rip your hearts out! What will happen to them after this? Their fate is none of our concern. - Doctor Chrysler! - Yes, Ruth. Is there a problem? Any problem at all? Would you like me to assist you with the next cook? They don't want the food. Just the Argo. Then come up here. Doctor Chrysler will be returning soon. Everyone gather round. The National Security Council are satisfied with our product. The testing process is complete. Congratulations. All hands to the pump now, we need to produce an Argo cook for prototypal tests in the field. Batch si47. The recipe was fairly straight forward. Si47? Yes. But that was one of our earliest batches? This often happens in trial and error, Ruth. Ruth, I find it quite strange that even now I have to question your professionalism. Are you going to cook with us? Were nearly done, my dear. Then you can go back to the real world. You can go back to your family knowing that you've played your part in securing a safe future for them. Until the next time, right? - There wont be a next time if you don't... - Eleanor. I'm sorry I sounded unprofessional. Is this batch si47? No. That is what remains of batch si58. - Shall I dispose of it? - No. Give it to the female subject. But we just gave them both a dose each! That's an order, Ruth. You're really slowing us down now. I'm sorry. Look at my face. Remember it. My name is Eleanor Chrysler. And You killed my brother and you sent my husband to his death. Your husband fought for us? What was his name? I know the name of every soldier who died for our cause. His name... was David Marcus Yearwood and he was the love of my life. I knew him. Don't you lie about him. Don't you dare! Son of Pamela and Isaac Yearwood. You see, I know because I called them myself. Told them how brave their son was. How he was one of our finest Company Commanders. You see, we care for the people of this country. What are you to the Council but a tool to fortify their autonomy? By doing this, you're destroying everything that David lived for. Fought for. Loved for... and died for. Witness hell, Zakarian. Anya. No. What are you doing? No! No! Anya! No! Oh God! Oh God. Anya. No. No. No, baby. No. No! God, what are you doing?! No! No! Oh, God, Anya! No! No! I'm going to rip you apart, Chrysler! There we are. The last of the silver dye and the last cook. Thank you. All. Thank you for the opportunity, Doctor Chrysler. Well done, Doctor Chrysler. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Okay. Once you've cleared up, you may return to your quarters to gather your belongings. You'll then be escorted from the facility and transported back to your civilian homes. If you're wondering about the test subjects. I imagine an armed unit will be picking them up shortly. To take them where? You're intelligent enough to work it out, Ruth. We're living under martial law. They're enemies of the State. They will be dealt with accordingly. What are you doing down here, Ruth? You're just going to put them down? What I've seen over the last 5 days has dismantled every principle I've lived my life by. These tests. No one... no thing deserves this. He's right. We are monsters. Just... just stop right there. Revenge. That's all this was about for you, Doctor Chrysler. You were driven by revenge. What drove you, Ruth? Ambition? To prove yourself? "Whatever it takes." Those were your words. You're just as responsible for all of this as we are. Now just step away from the control panel. No! No. The world needs to know what's gone on here. The truth about this regime. I hate that I was too afraid to say anything... and that I played a part. Do you know what the Council would do to you if you tried to talk? I don't care! This is wrong. This is evil. This isn't what Jamie or David would have wanted. You're a disgrace to their memory. Doctor Chrysler? What have you done? She... she... She was... She was... - She was going to... - I just want to get you sat up. Now Ruth, listen. Listen to me. We need to put pressure on it. Yes? We need to put pressure on it and were going to get help for you. Yes? I've got to get her medical assistance. No. No. No! You can't tell anyone. Edgar. This is murder. Oh. What now? Now, outside of the chamber, death shocks you? When it becomes real and not just pixels on a screen! What compassion did they show Jamie, Dad?! We're trying to restore peace to our country. I couldn't let her leak any... Eleanor! You're out of control. Why don't you give me your lab coat and I will... dispose of it. Ruth. Ruth, listen to me. Everything's going to be alright. You're going to be fine. Now listen. - Sandra's going to get help. Alright? - Yes. Yes. - She's going to get the medics. - What have I done? What have I done? - They're only a few minutes away. Alright? - Oh my God. But we have to keep pressing. We have to stop the bleeding. Alright? - Oh my God. - Eleanor. We have to get help for this young woman. Yes. Yes! Run. You never should have built that thing, old man. It was me. I'm responsible for all of this. Eleanor Chrysler. The most beautiful devil. You're a hypocrite. Oh... stronger than you look. Run, Eleanor! Dad... Oh! Oh, thank God! Please help us! Please help us! Clear! Who is responsible for this? This one is still alive. Who is she? What now, Zakarian? Huh? What more? I have nothing. I literally have nothing. I'm no good to you. Why did you let me kill her? Anya was a... she was a cancer to the UKLA. Worse than the one growing in my lungs. She... She turned my brother's head. Convinced him to abandon our cause... after all these years. But I'm... just... Yes, you're just an admin girl aren't you. Eleanor Chrysler. Just kill me then. I did all of this. I tortured your brother. And I... I killed a girl. An innocent girl. I have nothing left. I deserve to die. I deserve to die. Get dressed. There's work to be done. This stuff. It took my brother beyond humanity. I've found it, haven't I? Chrysler's weapon. The weapon thats going to put an end to this conflict. No. I've seen how much you value your life, Eleanor. Help... Everything I put you through in that chamber and yet it's one of these that breaks you. No more lies. No more wasting time I don't have. You win this war for us and you can name your price. You know what you need to do. What this country needs you to do. What David would have wanted you to do. Somewhere along the way, this country turned its back on grace. The same grace that made it great. That which welcomed two little orphan boys from Halabja. Helped them build a better life. The paradox of waging war to regain that grace is worth dying for... or at least thats what all who fight for me believe. But you and I both know that when this ends, there will be no winners. Only survivors. I need more coloring agent. Got it. Right. Lets get geared up. Safety first. Got a long night ahead. Subtitles by explosiveskull
