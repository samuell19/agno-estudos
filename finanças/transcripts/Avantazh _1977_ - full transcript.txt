BULGARIAN CINEMATOGRARHY presents UNACS TEAM Two young friends are reading for the Bar. One?s very sharp and graduates with first class honour. The other one is a bad student. But when they begin practicing, the bad student very gifted, the gift of the gab, so when he begins: "Your Honour, You remember the baker?s case in France." "I hope it won?t be repeated here." And people say: "That?s what I call a solicitor!" The other one with the first class honours though he knows much more, but hasn?t the gift of the gab, starts: "Your Honour, in view of Article such and such?" And people say: "No good." Datum for this movie is the documentary book of Petko Zdravkov "The story of one prosecutor" - They prosecute me from 3 to 15 years. Final conclusion ? hopeless. "Have you got a solicitor?" - No. I request the esteemed court to have in mind that I'll defend myself. They begin reading the accusation: Svetoslav Ivanov Dulgerov Sentenced 15 times. 30 years in clink. The youngsters are listening without believin: "Did you heard that?" "Sentenced 15 times! 30 years in clink!" The judge points to the Bar: "On this side you?re a defendant! On other - a solicitor!" Wanted to ridicule me. I look a mug on the outside. I go to the Bar. My right foot was trembling in the air. Looked at the for a minute and i start quietly: "Your Honour, I was born when "Aurora" announced the first socialist republic ? Soviet Union! I was born in a small mountain village? At 6 month I was a complete orphan. My mother and father died in a thunder storm." All lies? "I was left all by myself, from one family to another, from street to street..." "The street made me what I am now. Criminal. Long time ago, one October day in 1938, i was sent to Sofia prison... Once I was imprisoned? And there between the four concrete walls, I lay pale and thinking without the fragrance of flowers, without the songs of birds for 30 years. A life, a youth passed for nothing. Script ROUSY CHANEV GEORGI DJULGEROV I lost my life without aim of future Director GEORGI DJULGEROV Camera RADOSLAV SPASSOV and someday it'll end in an old men?s home... Music BOZHIDAR PETKOV Sound MIHAIL KARIDOV And so my name disappears. Prison is a terrible thing. Prison is a whore. And now I?m nothing but a dry vine-stock. But prison is not a means of reforming a man. These are not my words, I say, these are the words of the famous novelist Victor Hugo!" Let?em say Hugo wasn?t right. A young psychologist comes, says: "There are a few questions, you?ve got to answer in writing." Then I had cut my finger. "I can?t write" I can, but play the fool. "Who is your favourite writer?" "Botev - I say." "Why him?" "Botev was a revolutionist, that didn?t write for money. And nowadays writers only cringe." He stares at me and stares... Who paid Botev anything? Nobody. He had couple of more questions. "Are you afraid when you go stealing?" "Don?t go to the woods if afraid of bear. When I enter a shop I know it inside out." "When you steal a lot of money, are you happy?" I tell'im: "Wouldn? you be?" Stupid questions! Another question. "See two people fighting. What will you do?" "I'll disappear!" "But this is heartlessness!" And how many are in clink for trying to break up the fight? With 16 year sentence. He went to stop them. Te one got him and the other stab him. I?d as soon disappear in thin air as be a witness. The time was very dangerous. In short one could make a mass. I?m very flexible in this sort of thing. Politically I?m very well briefed. There was in Soviet reformatory a dangerous criminal. The chief of the reformatory wonders what to do with him. Once he tells'im: "Take this check and cash 3000 in town." The criminal draws the money? and starts wondering. Should he go back, or?? But reason gets the better of him and he returns. He put the money on chief?s desk. The chief drops it in the drawer. "Why didn?t you count it?" "You brought it"- the chief says. Makarenko was a pedagogue. He knew that if something is wrong. with the money, he wont show. And know the guy stays in front of him... Class criminal... And he is wondering, how he didnt knew about him till now, as Makarenko trusted him so much. This pedagogy is, you know? Out of these criminals Soviet chief made 36 generals! And twice more engineers and doctors. But we here, we have no such pedagogues. Who will cultivate us? I?ve witnessed all communist conspiracies in the prison. I was in prison together with the Red General Zaimov. with Anton Ivanov, with Vapcarov, with 18 parachutists. The communists made me wash a hall to see who?d take them away. Around 20:30 right before the check i was moping the saloon and the warden get gen. Zaimov out. General Zaimov was small, stout man. The warden was twisting his arm back... Cut the waining! Stop barcking, you are giving me headache. Wait, Cock! You know what will happen now? ROUSY CHANEV in the film ADVANTAGE "Avanta"(it.) ? profit, benefit "Avantage" (fr.) ? favorable situation We?ve got a prisoner ? Lazar Stefanov Kasabov. Nickname ? the Cock. Born on 11.09.1926 in Burgas. Education - primary. By profession, technician - encyclopaedist. Now write down, questions later. Indipendent, divorced. Sentenced 5 times, a pickpocket. Hiking all over the country. The greatest headache of transport militia. Cock, tell my students how do you do it. With these two fingers, no other way. I usually do a round of the waiting room. My mind takes a snapshot. - He studies, the psychological situation. - Yes, always, when I?m on a railway platform, I always study the psychological situation. - And what is the most important for you in such moment? - In this moment, for us the most important is the psyhological situation. Kasabov! Show them how you steal something. Now do you get your "shield", your "curtain". Take this one for instance... Rangelov, please. This wallet is lust right for nicking. Suppose you?ve already taken the "shot". You found out where he is. - Yes. Did you feel anything? A little, but if someone presses against me? And? I think about it all the time. - Cause you knew... Yes As i think he is here as he doubts me, if he reacts... A pick-pocket can be accused of only one theft. The theft he was caught for. But he?s been accused of more than 35. Lazar is an extraordinary case. He made a complete confession. More than that I exposed my accomplices. Thats quite interesting. - Lets get this case in details. Interesting, but i suppose we wont have time. Briefly, Kasabov. - I?ve said it before too? I wanted to save them. I?d hang myself just to get rid of this curse. Picking pockets is a curse. Whoever started with it, cant detach easy. I know even old people, heads of families, but they have no peace unless they do "a round". Comrade Major, by your request i deliver prisoner Milchev. The inside pocket is probably more difficult. Yes, it is more difficult. It?s usually in a tram or train. That?s special. Couldn?t you help a bit? Suppose we?re in a tram? Everybody?s holding the straps. Could Ivan be my "curtain"? Come here and cover me. We?re swaying, the tram is moving. Suppose he is a woman? She: "What do you want!" and starts chirruping. You?re her escort: "Leave the lady alone!" What are you doing? - Nothing - blackout. The two of you in the corner ? quick. Sit down, colleagues. Let's continue. Let?s hope it won?t last for ages. Call the electrical company. - Roger. You can have your wallet back. Go on! - What for? Why didn?t you steal from women? Because it?s very easy. When they start gaping. You can undress them. I never handle women. But women have handled me. There was such a case. I was on a line for cakes. I bend... I feel somebody?s picking my money. I turn round ? a girl nicking my dough. I tell her: "Can I feel around your bra?" "Can you what?" I tell her: "Give me back my dough, before you?re sorry for it." And her tears start falling: "What? Me, a poor student." Come on, do it! I take her by the hand and buy her a sweater for 184. Then a restaurant? But I spent a lot. Pinched two blankets and sheets from the hotel and moved to firing-range. "Let's play soccer." "Advantage! Advantage!" And she asks me: "Do you want to marry me?" "OK" I tell her. And the frogs blow their whistles like militiamen all night. They? re gonna kill you, stupid! Is it you again, Cock? - Nothing special. You can go on. It?s impossible for a woman to propose and not to have anything in her heart! No woman cam propose and not feel a thing. Everybody?s got something inside, particularly a woman. What?s the thing that makes us like a woman? That?s just what I wanted to make out! I found her. She was with a lieutenant. I became a captain immediately. Made the uniform myself. Duck trousers at 30 a yard. The tunic ? ready made for 80? And for 200 got the epaulets. I love you! I love you! It?s me, me. How was it? It?s a lot of dough. - It?s for you. Not now! Does it make sense now, here? My mother use to say: "Don?t mix with bad friends ? bird of a feather flock together." And I ask her: "Am I a good boy?" - "Yes!" "Why shouldn?t I mix with bad boys then?" "Let?em become good ? like me!" You haven?t found the right friends. Ask me what a friend is! We?ve been in the prison together for 2 years. You?re speaking about the Major, aren?t you? And now you are together again in the prison. Well, women, friends all they say is "Give me!" Is that the way you see life? Well, who knows maybe I don?t understand it. You know the life too well. It's only from now on what we'll have to discuss things. To think only of yourself. There?s nothing better, is there? If it were true? Help! Help! Help me! I'll tell you what happened once. I met a friend from Burgas. She greater than he. He'd run away from the school ? no money, nothing. And I swank at that. Walked up to the 5th floor to his girl friend?s. Nearly killed me. Let me see how much you?re worth. I take'im full board. Well done! - What are you doing? Do you think everything?s bought and sold? Oh, God, when you start like this? You?re real man, keep it that way. A real man must steal, mustn't? To steal, my friend, you need a hard ass! That bill?s yours. I lent you the money. I?m going, you can stay on if you want. Why do you chafe him? You stupid hens. It?s the Cock that sings in this world. What do you think? Hens such. Take my quitar as a deposit. Sorry, but I don?t need a guitar, but mandoline. The money that we spent. I'll give it back to you. I saw him one morning scrounge the room: "Now, what going on here?" I went after him and saw him from distance going in a candy store. But he opens it, like he owns it. I told myself: "I will guard here and we he went out I am gonna slap him good, to remember it for life time." In this moment a militiaman come and boom ? right in there. "Good job Lyubak, I am already seeing you how you will went out right through the showcase." Militiaman wants cake. Lyubo told him he is off working hours and they will surcharge him 500 leva and the militiaman will take the food from Lyubo?s children. The militiaman said: "Please, man, I am coming from the province, I am out all night, gimme something to eat." And Lyubo gives him two cakes. People start passing buy, it started to be dangerous, there is no time to think. And Lyubo is wondering what to do, the saleswoman can come any minute. And then? Part 183, paragraph 2, from 3 to 10 years. I enter the shop: "Why do you sell before working time?" The militiaman paid and left. Thank you! Said my friend. And when i got him outside: "Why are you stealing, motherfucker?" And i beat him good... I gave him a trashing but do you think it was any good? Ran away. I had a friend. We were together in the Air Forces. He went on a night flight and didn?t return. Crashed. How awful. Was he a good friend of you? I like risking and won?t go away. Once you taste high speeds you can never give it up. I?m single, my friend was married. Nevertheless, he?s a good friend. But this job was not for him. It was me that put him on. He starts asking: "Why should you fly and not me?" "I?m no less clever!" And takes the risk. But for him risk is an event, and for me, let?s say ? routine. I?m calm ? nothing to lose. And he?s got a family. When we start night flights, his whole family don?t sleep. And if the noise of the planes stops, they begin crying? One can?t fly if tied to the earth. The man gotta be a man, thats the drama. Come! Welcome. Class stand up. Attention. The young pioneers are ready for the grand meeting, named "Honourable Defenders of the Fatherland!" My God, what should I tell him? "Your teacher?s a liar!" It?s not a pedagogical! So I started. Made a trip round the world! Speak about the capitalism? About the sea of proletarian internationalism... I shot down all American plains. I caught all imperialistic spies. Pioneers! Eagles! Be ready! Tomorrow ? operation 2 at 9 a.m. Military secret! God, nearly killed me. Since life plays with me... I'll play with him too. The one that losses will win. The one that loves ? will win. I didn?t get you. The one that ? what? The one that loves? The hero's kiss. Terribly arrogant and rude people. Give me your hand! That?s a farewell. We'll never meet again. I?m leaving tomorrow. So long. Where are you going? - I'm going? ? on a voluntary labour camp. Wait. I'll come too. So I went to National voluntary labour camp. You can't count the barrows I pushed that summer. But it was the Cock who raised and lowered the flag. I don't know anything about camp. - You don't write things like that. I the prison file. Work, work ? but good food. Sports, love and sports! Good day. - Good day. Hello lieutenant, my name is Kasabov. May I introduce our girls? We?re from voluntary work camp. We don't know each other much. After all we are neighbours. Sit, sit down... Speak, comrades. Now, why are we here... We'd wish to set up relations with you. Let?s make friends. We think it would be good for everybody. We have to be friends. There's no need to have an iron curtain between us. After all we?re serving one cause. - Yes, that?s how we feel too. It?s good of you to have come. But there?s a great shortage? We haven't got enough boys to invite the ladies at the dances. It would be good if we took the initiative? We know yours is duty. Though? An idea's just struck me. A few explosives and we'll blow up a few rocks. For the ladies? Impossible! Everything is accounted for. No. No way! Do you want to listen a poem? - Yes. A Poem about the Flag. "I?m not idealist, I believe in matter I'd smash with my heel religion, but if they tell me that the Flag is matter, material from the shop - Oh, I don't believe it! I don't! The Flag is no matter, of no matter!" Have you sent it to a newspaper? - It?s too early! Don?t you think it's too sentimental? - No. it's good. (Russian language) "I"ll write about this and that, but this is no time for loving embraces! The whole of my strength of the poet I'll give to you ? attacking class!" Who is it by? - What? The poem. Looks like it's by a Russian ? a Soviet poet. And what?s his name? Comrade Vassiliy. Mayakovsky, you stupid. Maykovsky Stupid is his family name, but first name is Vassiliy! They pinched the flag! - Let's go! Stop! Block his way, he's from the other camp! Stealing?s no good. I have to prove that a woman can also? You want to win an extra point on "vigilance"? Is that the way to win the emulation? But we don't sleep! We keep a vigilant watch! Give back the flag! Calm down! Stop it! Where are you going? Give me the flag! Leave her... Get up! Calm down! Do you hear me? - I want the flag! Traitor! What did you say? - Traitor! Please, wait! I can?t accept being happy on account of other. You?re probably in love. I don?t want to break your friendship! How old are you? - 20. You read a lot of books? - Yes. What's Mayakovsky's first name? - Vladimir. Why? So that's it' you see? God, it's a lot of tears that fell on this Bulgarian flag! When they did return the flag? - Why should they return it? I?ve written a poem too: "We're first in emulation and it?s us that raise and lower?" What?s the matter? Since I want to be honest with you to the end? I don't want people saying I was talking behind your back? I want to tell you that I told the staff who you are! - And who I am? It's serious and there's no place for irony! You don't tell anybody you?re an officer. You said it was game so I thought it was. Military secret. I was against the explosives venture! Wasn?t I? I was against! After what happened with the flag. I started thinking thinks over. The Commandant will call in the militia to investigate your case. He asks me not to tell you, but? Now my conscience is clear. I have a child. Please. I am not a killer. On the contrary. They wanted to kill me. 'Cause I exposed?em at the meeting Of our FF organisation. Been suffering all my life for fighting for justice. Stand up. What are you doing? Stand up. The kid'll get scared. Leave me to die here, sister! What sister am I to you? You'll lade my stockings. Look at yourself. Stand up. Did you hit that bloody thick head of yours. It?s been much harder for me than to you. It was tougher for me... I had no parents when I met him. He studied to become a teacher. That was my greatest mistake. An intense love affair and the unpleasant consequences at the end. He spoke of marriage? But when we visited his place, his mother and sister didn?t approve of me, they thought that since he had a diploma he could marry some richer girl, educated. I am a bit strange, I decided since he didn?t love me? Have you got a place to sleep? - No. Come with me. We'll go to some friends of mine. It's me, Rumyana. There was a case ? a girl was pregnant. She went to a doctor. He agreed but abortions are illegal. She died on the table. The doctor lost his nerves, cut her up into pieces and burnt her. He lost his mind and gave up to the authorities. So there was no place for me to go for checking up and I remained pregnant. He left me in the maternity home and dropped me there and then. We met once or twice. I tell him: "We're both responsible." I don?t want anything from you but to give a name to the baby. He shouldn't be ashamed of our mistakes. Good night. Are you asleep? And what happened then? We had to go to court. He brought all the friends to prove I was a? whore. But our town is a small town and all the whores are well known. The court proved the paternity. But I was advised not to ask for anything else. A woman like me cannot be the wife of a man of a special circle. Why don?t you come here and stretch out a bit? I am afraid I may touch your arm. You are probably flaked out. The factory?s got prefabs. Many of us sleep in one prefab, all unhappy people like me. I'll make some room. Come on, come here. OK. Just a bit on the edge. ??? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????. Where do you work? - I am an officer. I buy arms. What is your rank? - Captain. Why don?t you warm your feet too? Feeling better? - Don't you know it? What's your name? - Rumyana. I'm Lazar. - Pleased to meet you. It?s faith that sent you my way. I?m serious. I?m very unhappy man, too. My wife left me because I was away all the time. She started living with a low-down type. Now i got only enemies. You saw what they've done with me. I have nobody in this world. I feel so low that I don't know why I?m alive. Honest. It?s only a woman like you that can pull me out of this maze? You are not asleep, are you? - No, no. It?s very hot, I am all sweating. I'll take my clothes off. Why don?t you, too? I don't want anything from you. Only to have faith in me. I'll take care of the kid too. I'll give you as much money as you want. I'll buy you stockings. They'll last you at least two years. I'll dress you up like a doll. My hands are golden, I can do anything with them: locks, watches, bikes, pens, accordions, I can do everything. And I?ve had women enough. You?re my future wife. You?re wrong. I?ve never had such intentions. I?m not the one you take me for. This is not the right place for such talk. I swear there?re no cigarettes. Do you want to dance? Well, and who are you? We? yesterday night? - What yesterday night? We got married. Wow! All right. But we don't have to look back on the past, we'll only look to the future. Thank you, Lazar. That was very good, wasn?t it, students? Nobody ever helped me, so how could I be a man. When I go out, if they don't start meddling, I will. They will. - Why? I'll work. But the militia will be after me. Since you didn't want to help them. That will never happen. And why? - I rely on you too. To help me when you go out. By splitting on people? Splitting on people hasn't helped any society. But had I split on people I wouldn't be here. You?re wrong. When they got Agapa, I was taken in too. They let me off the next day. The Prosecutor says: "Come for a coffee". In the cafe: "Agapa confessed, but 30'000 drachmas are missing." Should we arrange a visit? As you're friends he may tell you something. So he wanted me to split. You know he will be in trouble. They'll get the money anyway. You could help him, them and yourself too. Like getting him in deep water? Isn't that splitting? And suppose I tell you we've picked up, say, the Cock. Wouldn't you tell him? - I suppose I would. And isn't that splitting on me? Aren't you getting me into deep water? It depends on the way you look at it. That's it ? a bull?s eye. The side you're on today. The side of the new society or the other, which means against us. According to Soviet colleagues the best prosecutors find a common language with ex? I refrain to say "criminals". People that have committed crimes. They take care of them... Drenski! ...but also find understanding. Did you get it know? You unknowingly actualle helped. So think about those questions once more. It?s very difficult to win their confidence, students! They?ve a very strong sense of? - Justice. No, self-preservation. The instinct works very powerfull. Well, it is time to go. Here they?re helpless. But we don?t want to harm them. I've told them: "If I want to harm you, I can do it." They shouldn't be afraid. Zordan, can you interpret this dream of mine. It was like this: Burgas ? the lake. A yellow raft on the lake. And on the raft a few girls friends of mine. One good friend. My wife. They seemed to be calling me and I run and run but can?t reach them? Is that your friend? That?s me. It?s like this: You?ve discredited your friend as a man. And he'll have his revenge on you. His revenge will be terrible. The yellow colour?s jealousy. Water ? sexual intercourse. The wood of the raft, that's man?s? You know what? Your wife with him on the raft? You're a complete idiot! When things aren't your way I am an idiot. Cock, I?m not an idiot but? Rumyana's been seen coming here 2-3 times. Watch out. Where? Here? To the Politician officer, man. Be careful I tell you. Mind what you?re going to say. You too. Some boys saw her coming out of Politician?s office. All dishevelled and blushed. You criminal mug. What did I say? If one day I start killing all swine, you'll be the first. I Will crush you, faggot. So we have a visitor. - Can I stay on? How did you come in? - No problem. You want me sent to prison too? Send this to my wife, please. First, I'll send you to the cooler. Take him to solitary confinement. Didn?t know you were a poet! "Now you?re in a morgue of life your body?s slowly destroyed. Destined to everlasting torture, in agony you wait for the blessing of Death." Sir! - Wait a minute! Are you going to cry now? What?s the matter? What now? Rumyana's unfaithful to me. I'll kill her. Can?t be. She's having it off with you. You're crazy, aren't you? She brought this petition: "To: The Officer in Chief I have a two year old boy from Kasabov. I kindly request you to permit our marriage with Lazar Kasabov." Anything to say? Going to cry again? Seems I've developed a tick, might be I?m unwell. - How long has that been? Just before the last sentence? In the militia preliminary. I was there for a month and didn't say a word. And then they sent her to influence me. I?d turned my jacket inside out to keep it clean, hoped to get out. To my frined Lazar, one obstacle from oblivion 21.01.1954 Rumi After that I took a typewriter, 25 pages, a whole novel. Names, facts, dates, everything! In the court ? 10 criminals against me! I tell the judge: With two inspectors as guards I guarantee to catch all pick-pockets on trains. If I try to run away let them shoot me! Then an ex-friend of mine jumped. "He wants to get us in deep water to work out an easy sentence for himself." If that was right I'd confess to the theft only which I was caught red-handed for. You?ve got children. Do you think of their future? "You, he said, leave my children alone, think of yours." Rumyana?d come with the kids. You?ve been new to the game and me ? an expert! I gave it up once and for all with a clear conscience! "Conscience?", said the other one. "Is it you that'll talk about conscience, sucker?" Sucker? Me? You?d turn a traitor to your Fatherland! Order a search of his house! You'll find 2 back-sacks. Wanted to use them to run away to Greece with. And the judge: "Should we make a search?" They confessed but only as a gesture. "Was it only a gesture buying the sacks?", he asked. Why are you looking at me? What do you mean? Do I deserve death by your laws? As a traitor? That?s over! So I deal with them one by one. All? - Yes! Well, why? Don't you see? - No. I explain it to your pupils. That's clear but you tell me? Is there anything else? Because? Sit down. Now listen carefully! You know I have a lot of different cases. The question is about a man who's committed many thefts. Whiz! No childhood, no parents?control, a man who takes risk? Now listen! From time to time he disappears. In Sofia, in a small street, he plays football with the kids. The militia's looking for him all over the country and he? He faces the question, why have things been like this for some time and then suddenly he does the opposite? Did you know yourself? Don?t hit your head, It took me quite some time to arrange your thoughts. Try to understand. You?ve got another 4 years. - Three and 9 months. A woman and 2 kids are waiting for you there. But I can?t do everything. The rest?s for you to do. I'll do my best. Well, what do we do now? In the solitary till New Year. In the meantime make an application. For a civil marriage. Write about the kids, everything. And we'll see. May I take my leave! Why did they put you here? Tsetso writes to Petrana from the woman?s section. He tells me: "Take these 5 packets of fags to her". I tell the stupid duck: One for you, 4 for me, otherwise I'll freeze you. Won?t be able to smoke at all. - But she told him. The bastard stared a fight. You know I don't hit first, but when I do? Writing an application? - A love letter to Max, the Gypsy. His girl friend was transferred to another prison. He doesn?t know. He gives me fags to take to her so I have to answer back. Would you help me? OK, sit down. Write: "My sunshine, joy of my life, wonder of wonders! I?m waiting for you day and night. When I cry I want a strong man to dry my tears, a strong man to take care of me?" Oh, come on! The way you started? Gypsy Max, a strong man, just skin and bones. I'll write like this: "Got the fags! I love you, I love you!" To hell with it! - What?s that? I put the full stop. Left circle?s mine, the right ? yours. If it goes into your ? you pay! No, the other way. Write fifty for me. How long have you to stay in? A lot! If they don?t give me a pardon ? 6. What would you say if? Fifty for me! And to give me an extra? - They will if they catch you. If we are allowed this marriage, we'll have a lot more chances. Rules are rules. Your ideas are useless. You?re dealing with criminals. At least he had his mark as a criminal, and there are others that wouldn't dare show a sign of life even? We?ve got 3 people, the man at the gate, the circle and the officer. Five minutes before the roll-call ? you in this bog. Another one in that and two more upstairs. The warders do their rounds. Everybody?s in the cells. They check the bogs and you finish them off. In the meantime I'm with the officer. I ask for permission to see the Politician. He thinks I?m one of the birds, he wants to keep working on me. This one comes back, meanwhile you got here... I deal with the Politician and press the bell, You go that way and we join the forces, there'll be 5 of us. Three this way and two that way. We keep close to the wall. At the gate we'll finish that one off. We go out and the jeep on duty is ours. It's 2 ours drive to the border. They'll know only in the morning? And we'll sing them: "Oleh cangaseiro?" You know these aren't criminals but small fry. Nobody?s been able to find their weak spot and help them. You don?t even know their names! Why should you patronise some of them? That?s professional egoism. Next thing, I'm an enemy! Listen to me... We can?t change things at once. Step by step. Agreed. The other three though shouldn?t know us. Only one of us will know them and they ? him only. That one will risk a lot. We'll toss a coin. The fly. In whichever circle it goes, it?s him. Me! Do you have anybody in mind? - When the time comes I'll tell you. What?s the time? - 3 o'clock. Now tell me, will you support the application or not? Can we do it in the office? It's more ceremonial here. Here are the guests too. Welcome! Hello, Rumyana. Take this sweet. See who?s here? Shall we begin or not? Come on. We don?t have time! Are you starving? - No. We?re sick quite often though, but get well quickly. I'll be out soon. Wait for me. Come on! I found them quickly, but had to drink two bottles of vine. From the best man to the bride. What bride am I? Could the children stay? Isn't it for them that we take all this trouble? Why should we hide, there?s nothing wrong? Rumyana Georgieva. - Yes. Do you want to marry Kasabov? - Yes. Lazar Kasabov? - Me, me. Do you want to marry Rumyana Georgieva? Ain?t I here? - Yes or no? Yes, I do. - Sign here! Dear comrades! Today?s your happiest day! You start together hand in hand. Family is the pillar of society. So you'll make an united family? Stop. - Let me finish! I wish you? - Stop it! Sorry. Friends, to err is human. But that doesn't mean he's branded for life. Though signed in prison your marriage?s fully legal. In future live in such a way that these children shouldn't be ashamed of you. Let?s forget the past and think of the future. Have you finished? Help yourself. - Congratulations! My boy! This is for you. May we come in? Close the door! See what the buggers're planning. - What? Escape with killings! Your lad's in it too. Don?t hold my hand so tight. Please, don't! Wait! What?s this about going out soon? You?re not running away. No, I am not. There?s something else I am working on. When the time comes, I'll tell you. The Boss likes me a lot. And if I tell him about something... It?s good for him and for me! I am becoming part of "the team". By the autumn I'll be with you! - I couldn't get you at all. It's the latest thing in technology, Sir! That?s all, Sir! How old are you? - 53. The man with the young heart! Agape, go to the door! Here we are! On the occasion of your wedding we'll make a small show for them. It?s too early. Nothing ready yet. Look! Better than a razor! Each one knows what to do. Your best man's on duty tonight. Nobody'll suspect. If you ask me, we'd better wait. What's there to wait for? For somebody to give us away? What the hell am I doing with you, kids? So, you are backing off? - Put that piece away, please. Don?t be a mug, Cock! Do you know how it's at the border ? snow, cold. It?s either yes or no. Is that clear? Yes, it is! - Cock, what about you? Quite clear. I haven?t said no. Sir, an escape's underway. I was to get rid of you. ????????? ???????? ?? ???????, ?????? ???... Don?t play with fire! Kassabov's just informed me of escape plan. If you want the details? No, I don?t. Come and guard him! Cock, Cock! You kicked the milk bucket. I did my best. You kicked the milk bucket. 20 YEARS LATER Gerchev, a doctor of Low - Kassabov? Yes, I remember him. But after so many years? Well, yes. He?s got some prizes, extra visits. He even had some home leave? He got 20 month remission. Unfortunately what happened later... I don't know. He wrote to me once, that he?d started work as a photographer. I can?t correspond with everyone that writes. That's a problem we've still got to solve. We lose touch after they leave here. If they write, yes, but we? At a wedding in the country, I hear over the loudspeaker: And now for my ex-chief the song. It was one of our ex-prisoners. Then we had a chat. He said: "I'll never forget your words." What were those words, I couldn't remember. The thing is he remembers them. Rumyana Kostova, ex-Kassabova, Waitress We got married in prison. It was then he said: "I'll be out soon." He wanted to dupe a few prisoners in to escaping and then report them to the militia? I told him frankly: "If they suggest to you to escape and you tell the militia that?s all right. But you want to dupe them and since they have no character they swallow your bait and? that?s not nice of you." Then I met my husband the one I'm married to now? Yes! Everybody liked him, my uncle? He?s a good man. Agreed to take me with the kids. Though? I had already given my son from Kassabov to some people for adoption? Sorry. Sorry. For the children. - Yeah. Everybody was advising me, so I thought it over: Why should I be the hero to straighten out a man! Wont it be too much for me? Suppose he drags me into it? What if i cant resist... I nearly went nuts. I was wandering what to do. One day? just as I was hanging out the washing? He came? I nearly fainted. He didn't notice that of course. We weren?t divorced yet. The case was still in court. I told him it wasn?t just a game. Everything was settled once and for all. If he proved he?d reformed, only then I could? But I couldn't waste my life just like that. He had bought a lot of things for the kids. He said: "I could do all sort of things". You can but what?s the use when you don?t have certificates? You'll get the lowest pay of all. I was pressed to give away? To give Kassabov's son for adoption. I wanted to be straight with him. Not to lie to him and to tell him the truth. That was better. And since I saw that? I let him stay overnight. There was nothing between us. He was happy. He wanted to prove his love. Said I was his only true love. I used to have a very good figure. No matter how kind-hearted I was firm? In the factory I worked there was a guy - a graduate. Started telling me: "He'll never get straight, he?s not used to discipline." The next morning my uncle took me to the hospital? to get a certificate that he?d beaten me so that I could get a divorce. Here they are. I'll cut her throat if you shoot! He disappeared and I?ve never seen him since. I heard he was killed while trying to escape. P. Zdravkov ? author of the novel ?A Prosecutor tells? Kassabov holds a special place in my memories as a prosecutor. The film studies the conditions that deform the character of this unhappy man. After the noble Sacrifice which he made in the name of the new life he was striving honestly for he felt disappointed and rejected. This put him of balance. After 6 month he escaped and crossed the border. How exactly he died is not known. About the Cock? You?re not filming now, are you? Could I see the script? Because I?m artist too. I'm artist from Balkantourist. We make some souvenirs. It?s nothing much but life?s a lot of fun. Well, I've just remember something funny. The Cock was telling me a dream of his. You'll find it interesting. You film-makers fall for dreams. The raft! The raft?s going! Comrade! (rus.) Don?t! Listen to me! Is that you again? Run, run!
