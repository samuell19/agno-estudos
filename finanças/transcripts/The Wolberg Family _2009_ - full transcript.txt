THE WOLBERG FAMILY Good day, Mrs. Hagelstein. Last time, I put too much sugar. It was nauseating. And you said you'd add vanilla. Right! I had forgotten. It's not so cold now, isn't it? -I hate it when seasons change. -I like it. It has a melancholy feel. Anyway, I won't spend one more summer in this town. You realize I've lived here for 17 years? -Where would you like to go? -Abroad. -Where? -I haven't decided yet. I think I'd like Italy. -Yes! Italy's splendid. -The country where you met Dad. Enough with that story! Go away if you don't want to hear it! All right. So, it was on a train back from Italy, where I had led a wild life. I was crying. Because I had left my boyfriend behind. You thought you'd never meet again? Well, I knew I'd have to wait. He lived in Naples, and I in Blagnac. So, I was crying my eyes out. Opposite me, there was a man, sitting by himself. Was he handsome? I don't know if he was handsome, but what stroke me was that he was well-dressed, with a black suit. -Buttoned shirt. -Chic already? All of a sudden, he said to me: "When will you stop sniveling like that?" -Brutal! -Yes, but efficient. I looked at him, and he said: "You're pretty when you cry, but also when you don't." We were in the country. He wasn't paying attention to me. I kept pretending I was asleep. And suddenly, he pulled the alarm! The train stopped in the wilderness. Everything stood still, as if disaster were to strike. Simon got off the train. He disappeared into a field and came back with a sole poppy in his hand. -You left out a detail. -The poppy was stunted. That's true. Either way, he gave me the poppy with a look... How can I describe it? -With a terrible look. -"Terrible"? Yes, like this. Mr. Mayor, your presence here is an honor. Thank you, son. That's sweet. I wasn't expecting this. Thanks. Thank you very much. Here. Now, the speech. I hold it very dear. Maxine Brown was a young, black woman born in 1945 in Seattle. Her life was punctuated by misery, misfortune and fear. Coming from a family of 10 kids, she didn't have enough to eat. At least, not enough to eat her fill. Aged 10, she fled from home. Luckily, she was taken in by a nun who made her sing gospel every day. This is how she developed her marvelous voice. She could have ended up on the street, sick, as a prostitute, taking drugs, but no! Luck knocked on her door again. She met... a brilliant producer, someone who believed in her. He had her record 10 tunes, each more moving than the other. When aged 25, she tragically died, alone, in painful circumstances, of tuberculosis. It is said that Maxine Brown never knew love. Now, you, children of Mourenx, I hope you're worthy of your country and of what it did for you. And I hope you all serve France just like Maxine Brown served the United States of America. Maxine Brown! Ladies and gentlemen... What do we do now? Oh, my favorite fellow citizens! Are you done? You looked around, and nothing's changed since last time? You've changed the curtains. After 20 years, they had turned yellow! They were the same in Antwerp. Right, but the previous ones were better. I've brought you fresh fruits and veggies, so you can make soup or stewed fruits. How's Marianne? Still as beautiful? You could come by and see for yourself more often. I'm too old to go out. Old people and their fusses! Simon, you're being rude! I'm old too, you know? True, you've always been old. -Got anything to tell me about? -No, nothing. Your mother knew how to make you talk. I told her what she wanted to hear. So she wouldn't worry. Do you think it helped her face death? I think so. The shrubs are in bad shape. You should have them pruned. She takes care of them. -Who is "she"? -Sarah. Your very last conquest? You didn't give her our diamonds, I hope. Where does your crudeness come from? From my grandparents. Big Jewish peasants hidden away in Antwerp. -They weren't as refined as us. -"The Jewish peasants," I knew them better than you. They weren't rude. They were hard-pressed. I hope that never happens to you. She isn't just young, she's fun and very cheeky. I don't like fun women. It's anti-sexy. And stop smoking. Does she know about Mom? She knows I'm a widower. My relationship with your mom is my own business, you know? No, I completely disagree. No, leave them shut. The neighbors will think we have something to hide. What could we be hiding? I don't know. A horrible crime... Such as killing our own two children? Why would we have done that? To be left alone! Just to be the two of us. You're insane. No, something else. I would have killed your lover. Why would you have killed him? Because you made love together. And me? Why would I have killed you? Because of the memories. As I'd always remember the way I made love with him. You're insane. No! -Why not? -Come here. I want the whole town to know we've made love. Making love is not outrageous. It is. Love is outrageous. Especially in the afternoon. In the middle of the week, in the family house. After a depressing meeting, while the kids are out, and while everyone else in town is working, I'd rather make love with my wife. What kind of music for tonight? Mom's favorite! Oh, no! Not that sad song again! I like sadness, sweetie. That golden-glittered voice... -Alex, I'm happy you're here! -Me too. Why is that? What did you say your name smelled like? Wait... -Like existence? -Exactly. Isn't it true? Why do rebels always use conventional words? I wouldn't word it like that, but it's stifling here. Even you left your parents' home at a young age. But I feel fine everywhere. -Right, but I'm fed up. -You're lucky, though. How so? You have a brown-haired Jewish father. As opposed to... Being awfully unlucky, and having a blonde father. Really? I'd like to try that out some time. What a nice-looking meal! -Alex, we've made a Polish meal. -I'm starving. -Help yourself. -Nice change. Your plate, honey. My son. Well, Alex, don't hesitate to stuff yourself. -Bon appétit. -Dad, the blonde dad wouldn't talk like that. I'll show you what horror you missed out on. See what daddy's doing, son? Delphine, eat some vegetables. Alex, why did you leave your parents? Since you're a blonde dad now, I'll be honest. I didn't like them. Yet, you loved your sister. -I love Marianne. -That makes two of us. How about you, Delphine? Do you see yourself leaving the family unit? I hope it happens, yes. Would you do it freely or for someone else? Be more precise, blonde dad. Would you leave because you love a man more than your parents? Yeah, of course! Can you elaborate? Don't be afraid, Miss Wolberg. -Love matters more than family. -But, Delphine, you're not answering me. Would you... -Family isn't sexy. -What do you mean by that? Should we wander around in our undies? -Yuck! -Indeed. Stop it, Dad, you know that's not it! -Simon, you get it. -No, I don't. Not at all. Desire and family life can't always mix. -I don't understand all this. -Neither do I. -Will you come for my birthday? -What are you talking about? What? In 3 weeks, February 10, it'll be my birthday. You turn 18. Unbelievable! You usually don't care about your birthday. Precisely. This time, I don't want it to be like the other times. -I want it to be really special. -"Really special"? Something exceptional! Actually, I'd like it to be a peak, the peak of all of our lives. And... A moment that'll be forever carved in our hearts and stone. "Carved in our hearts and stone"? Sure, why not? -Hello, Mr. Richard. -We didn't call you, Mr. Mayor. Your kids aren't going to school. That's serious. When will the social worker show up? My wife, Marianne Wolberg, will take care of you. She'll come every fortnight at first, and then we'll see, one step at a time. -We could maybe meet your wife. -She's not here. -Maybe we could wait for her. -No. We can't. -I'll come back later this week. -Right, later this week. My agenda, please. Would Thursday or Friday be fine with you? I don't know. Go back to your room, kids. My wife won't be coming back. She left last week. She left a note. I'll read it to you. -I'd rather you didn't. -"Stéphane... "I can't stand it anymore. "You won't let me live. "It feels as though I'm suffocating. "I tried to warn you, but you never listened. "Think of our two sons first. Take good care of them. "I'll come back to see them. "Catherine." I'm sorry. Did you think she's with a man? I have no idea. This letter calls for a response. You must reply. I don't know how to write to her. I don't. Now's the time to show her you have spirit, you want her, your desire her, you won't give up on her... Be innovative. You must try to persuade her. Tell her things you've never told her. Tell her you miss her terribly. -Tell her the kids miss her. -I won't get them involved. Precisely, you've reached a point of no return. The end justifies the means. I love my kids too. You can try it out, if you like. I wouldn't dare. I'm afraid I'll break it. It doesn't break that easily. Here, hold it. Want to learn how to grab a chord? You fooled me. Didn't you? -Does your father know? -No. He wouldn't approve. He doesn't want me to become a Bohemian like you. -Why do you hate each other? -I don't know. It's hard to say. Like cats and dogs? I hate what Simon represents, and it's mutual. Dad says Bohemians aren't on the right side of life. What's the right side of life? I'll show you. Some people live their life. REAL LIFE Others don't live their life. What's fun isn't to be on one side or the other. But to go from one side to the other. Look. It's tiring. Keep going. It is tiring, but it's the best. You're good. You can do it long. I can't anymore. I'd rather stop. Which side do I choose? -Stay on the "real life" side. -And you? I'm always beside real life. -Beside yourself? -On the side... Like... Like a soccer game supporter who's shy. "Simon Wolberg, everlasting energy for your town." -Did you come up with that? -No, but it works. Where do you find the motivation to do this? If you had a dream childhood, be thankful to your mayor. Whatever! Delphine, we really need a hand. Can't you help us? My name may be Wolberg, but I don't have to exert myself for my father. You have a wonderful father. Spend more time with him. So? François, why don't you do the same as we do? Why don't you have fun? Why don't you go out with girls? You're an idiot. You're exaggerating. -I fear you'll meet bad people. -"Bad people"? I fear you'll end up moneyless or sick, with no one to help. I have friends everywhere. Don't you worry. A girlfriend in each port? Sort of. A nice girl in every city. -Who's here? -Camille. Remember her? She went to high school with you. Yes. She was beautiful and unapproachable. -She didn't want you then. -True, but people change. I'm not here for her. Why then? -You're not happy, Marianne. -Nonsense. I know you all too well. I know you're not happy. I didn't come here for Benjamin and Delphine. And I didn't come for Camille's company. Dump Simon! None of you know what my heart feels. Already here, Simon? You're early. Only by 10 minutes. -Dom Pérignon 1973. -Wow. Last year, you brought a 1975. I remember. It was great, too. I moved heaven and earth with the wine guy. I said I was the mayor's father to no avail. He had none left. Well... -Shall we? -You go first. Rose, my darling, this year was not too good. The house made life difficult. The roof fell in. The repairs cost a fortune. Tamara Telkasch died in the fall. She had Alzheimer's. She thought I was Czestochowa's chief rabbi. She kept asking where her friend Rose was. She kept giving me lectures, arguing I led a bad life. What else? I've put on 5 kg! I can't lose them. You should go to Weight Watchers! -What watchers? -Weight Watchers! Meetings to speak of the weight you and others have gained. I don't care about other people's weight. I've lost a lot of hair. Too bad. You liked it better before. What about Sarah? Won't you tell to Rose about her? Right, I met a woman named Sarah. She's quite different from us. She's very young and cheeky. She's rude, that's all! Simon! We're not the same. Come on, let's go. Mom, this year was great for me. As opposed to Dad, I haven't put on weight or lost a single hair. That didn't make me more handsome either. I've worked like a mad man! I did many things for the town. I'm turning it into a modern town. More in synch with the rest of the world. Marianne is still as beautiful. The kids are fine. I had the house repainted. Is all this true? Sure. And I'm planning on doing even more next year. For Marianne. For the town. For the kids. Dad will tell you all about it next year. Why me? No reason. You know, Simon, parents die before their kids. You do know that? Let's drink. To you, Rose. Now you've gone too far! Mr. Mayor, last year, you swore it was the last time you were bringing champagne here! Excuse me, sir, but it's a tradition. This is a place of worship. Put yourself in the place of people who come to meditate. Last year, you promised that... Mom... I'm very ill. -What are you doing here? -I knew you'd come. How did you know I'd be here? "Soppy man seeks soppy place for his daughter's soppy b-day." This was the only place. The nightclub of your youth. Right. -Can I have a cigarette? -Here. Thanks. I had never come here. It has its charm. -Doesn't it? -A nice change from my trips. To me, it's the most romantic place in town. It's... This is where my fellow citizens come to daydream and smooch. I never come here, of course, since I'm always working. -What do you do on your trips? -What do you mean? I mean... How do you spend your days? I walk a lot, I watch people, I sit wherever I can, I usually eat in the street. I sometimes meet people who put me up, but it's rare. How do you cope with solitude, with being alone? I like solitude a lot. And you, how do you spend your days? Me? I work. -What do you think? -But what do you do, actually? Actually? Actually... I worry. I worry and I console. What if you didn't have all that? The town, the Wolberg Family... What would you do? I have a passion for the sea. I quit... I quit sailing when I met Marianne. So... It's too bad. You should've kept sailing. Yes, well... But also... A poor little Jew on his boat, as a single-handed sailor... Introducing the fish to the Shoah issue... Do you know why geese don't fly over Auschwitz? Because those geese are cooked! Cooked. My goose is cooked, too. I don't understand a word! -Where are we going? -Come on, don't worry. Hello. Yes? I'm Simon Wolberg, your mayor. Yes, I know who you are. -Are you campaigning? -Correct. As you know, elections are coming up. Yes, I'm aware. Well... All those billboards are hard to miss. "Simon Wolberg, everlasting energy for your town"? -Correct. -It sounds good. I'm doing the rounds. To see how the land lies, so to speak. May we come in? Sure, please do. Are you interested in city management? You know, I work all day, so... I'm not too interested in politics. What are you interested in then? In my privacy. Do you have a wife, a partner... No. Kids? Neither. If you had a family, things would be different. You couldn't afford this life. What life? This nonchalant, improvident, somewhat Bohemian life. You're quite self-centered. You don't really care about the people around you. -Caring about myself is enough. -Right. And it shows, too. Where's the bedroom? Upstairs. What are you doing, exactly? I'm the mayor. I'm allowed to see your bedroom. The size of this room is quite small. This is the reflection of a petty life. Bastard! Bastard! Dad, it's Mom's song! I did it. What? You'll see when I tell Simon! Benjamin, look at me! Look at me! Daddy will be very glad. I saw the blonde man. What? Benjamin, you and your sister will always be my children. I'll never abandon you. What's going on between your dad and I is something else. A world separate from kids. We each have our private world. You're entitled to yours too, where only you can let people in. Daddy says family encompasses everything, the whole world. And he says it's happy, not sad! My darling... You despicable man! What you did wasn't right. How could you involve Benjamin in this? It was a combination of circumstances. Have you lost your mind? What's most revolting is that you took him on your raid. What happened to your usual restraint? It was an accident. Don't overreact. I'll do all I can so Benjamin can forget about this. -I'm sure he's already moved on. -He hasn't. It will haunt him! We're a family. Can't we know all about each other? No! I'm entitled to having secrets towards my children! -And vice versa! -Is that so? So, Benjamin and Delphine also have secrets? Delphine stole an eraser at the supermarket? Benjamin... He's decided not to greet the baker anymore? You're crude! We're entitled to knowing everything about each other. Even if it's hard to bear at the time. That's how we form one and the same family. I'll help my children as best I can till my life's over. I know that. And so do you. You should have never gone to see Daniel. He's not "Daniel," he's "the blonde guy." I have every right over him. Even the right to kill him. You'll be thrown in jail. And we'll stay at home. -You wouldn't try to get me out? -No! You'll get what you deserve. You'll stay in jail. That's all. You know it's not true. And you know you're killing me when you say that. Marianne, why did you want to leave us? I was unhappy, that's all. I forbid you to go see Daniel again, you hear? He almost went mad when I told him it was over. So now, you leave him alone. I don't care about his pain! You hear? I don't care. Be very careful, Simon. Be very careful. See here, since last time? The nodule, right here, on the lungs, it's grown. It shrank for a while, but now... It's growing. You must undergo more exams, start treatment. It's serious. I've told you about treatment. Shall I repeat? No, don't. I know. And there's something you can't do any longer. You must tell your family. -No! -They can't be left in the dark. Simon, you must at least talk to Marianne. -No. -Your wife has a right to know! Will I be strong enough for Delphine's birthday? For Delphine's birthday, yes. I see... something... grand! Something Olympic that would pay tribute... -to the greatness of youth! -Don't mock your dad like that! You've never had a father, so you can't understand. You'll run on fine sand from eastern Africa. Very fine sand, like gold. And soft like my wife Marianne's hair. For the terraces, I envision midnight blue velvet seats. -Fans will tear them, sir. -In my stadium, -no more fan problems! -How? Decapitated! In their place, I'll put gentlemen. Perfect gentlemen, as youth must officiate beauty. Youth mustn't just officiate beauty. Youth must also enjoy life, and receive life's quiet and sometimes violent beauty. Growing up with complete peace of mind, so they can fully blossom once they're adults. And most of all, let their parents cherish them. In 2000, around mid-April, do you remember what happened? April 2000... No, total blank. How could I remember? We won the swimming competition together. I remember everything we did together. It's all up here. Do you really remember everything we did together? You're too much of a nostalgic. Forget about all that. I've never heard anything this stupid. Delphine, I'm in love with you. This can't be, François. That's not how it works. Hi! So young and already nostalgic. My darling little boy. Don't call me that. Why do you always come back to where you played as a child? That's the way it is. Mr. Richard's kids told me you often wander around town, -looking weird. -"Looking weird"? My darling, you're happy, aren't you? Are you happy? Funny, all those tags. "You whore, move your fat ass!" "Jessica and Pascal, quit showin' off!" "Get lost, you old geezers!" I LOVE YOU AND YOU MAKE ME SUFFER "I love you and you make me suffer." Benjamin, please go wait for us elsewhere. Mr. and Mrs. Wolberg, I made you come to talk about your son Benjamin. -I know him well. -Miss, can we go to the gym? Yes, go. So, Benjamin is usually a dreamer, very pensive, he's quiet and has never been troublesome. But he's been irritable and unpleasant lately. -I find it worrisome... -Do we go to the pool tomorrow? Yes. So, I tried to talk to him. But he wouldn't answer me. -We've had family issues. -I see. But it'll all be forgotten soon. It'll be back to normal soon. -One thing is sure... -Mr. Wolberg, why send me this? It's the letter model to send to your wife. -I wrote it thinking of you. -Daddy! "Simon Wolberg, little cooked goose. Alexandre." -Don't you dare break it! -No, buzz off! Get! -Because of the billboards? -Get lost! -I thought you'd like it. -Clear off! Simon, don't do that, please. Alex, why did you do that? Well... Goodbye, everybody. Delphine, I wish you a happy birthday. Be happy, my little niece. Benjamin, here's my guitar. With a broken arm, I can't play. Alexandre! I can't take it anymore! What did Alexandre do to you? Living with you is unbearable! Do you think you're God? I understand why Benjamin loses it in class! -You talk rubbish! -Right. I'm certainly not God. You are my gods, my sweets. When we were babies, pissing and shitting, we were gods, too? When I changed your diapers at 3 a.m., yes, you were gods. Why didn't you let Mom leave with Daniel? She might've been happy with him. Delphine, how do you know? I just know. It makes me a bit sad, but I think I can understand. That's not what we want, Dad. We don't want you like this. Living with you is unbearable! Now, you must change! Change! Why are you all betraying me? Delphine, you're an idiot. And you, Marianne... You're two idiots. Why aren't you saying anything, Benjamin? Hello. I'm Simon Wolberg. Will you introduce yourself every time? Anyway, I knew you'd come back. -Won't you let me in? -No, you'll soil my house. And should there be a scandal, everyone might as well know. The citizens of this boring town should see the show of the year. Go ahead. -What, "go ahead"? -Go ahead and slap me. I don't want to wait 10 years before you slap me. When I head out, I don't want to wonder when you'll punch me. It never hurts as much as you think. I can't stand that timeless elegance blonde men have. This obsession with timeless elegance. This permanent style you flaunt. Snow, rain or storm, your hair's always perfect, irony on the tip of your tongue, that shitty irony of yours! -You're unworthy! -Of elegance or of Marianne? Of Marianne! Besides, you don't even exist. You're so blonde... You look like a porcelain cherub! Without a sex. You look like a chick with your yellow hair. You must stink like an eggshell! You wife has beautiful breasts. Right but her breasts don't remember you. My hands do. Little shitty hands with your delicate fingers... If Marianne were seeing this, she'd hate you. You think I took her from you? Marianne doesn't belong to anyone. Not to me, not to her kids, not to this town. I didn't come to punch your face in. I've come to know how Marianne was when she was with you. She laughed a lot. She laughed over the slightest thing. She has a beautiful laugh. Very warm. A very loud roaring. It makes her greater and fleshier than usual. When she laughs, she squints her eyes. It's beautiful. She also talked a lot about you and her family. She said you were her darlings. Her loved ones forever. She said Benjamin would be a ladies' man and Delphine a vivacious young woman. They'd be quite successful. Even though, now, it was the last thing on their mind. She called me "her blonde Trojan prince." It used to amuse me when she called me that. But now I realize it was addressed to you. She called you "Mr. Golden Glitter with gray hair." That's all. -She'll leave you, you know? -I know. -You know when? -No. Do you? With me, it was a mere rehearsal. A conclusive rehearsal. She saw it was possible to do without you. She'll do it again. The rehearsal was a success? I gave her the self-confidence to do it. To live without you. It's odd. It feels like they've grown much older lately. True, she's got a wrinkle in the corner of her eyes. -Yes. -What's so worrisome? Delphine's birthday. You thought those fools didn't think about it? What will they be like in 10 years? They'll still be as good-looking. They're sensual and soft at the same time. A bit like a sad drunkenness. As if we drank a tad too much. Just enough to feel you're letting go. Just too much to feel faint. It's strange. I've never heard you speak like this. "A sad drunkenness." Sounds like a definition for love. No! Love is much more violent, don't you think? Right, love is more violent. Marianne, you haven't had your period for a while. -You went through my panties? -No, not at all. But when you had your period, you were in a special state. Don't talk about period moods. No, but when you had your period, you were approachable. I loved that. As if bleeding made you open up to me. You haven't been like that for months. And now you can't have any more kids. I know. I didn't want to tell, as I don't know why it hurts. It hurts to know I'm barren now. But you've been more sensual since then. You seem freed from a burden. What do you mean by that? Now, when we make love, we only think about ourselves. We make it for both of us. I loved making love to you thinking we might get a kid. I really enjoyed making love to you. What's this? The ghost of your younger self? No. It's Delphine's birthday dress. Simon, did you hear what Delphine said? Yes. What will you do? I love you, Marianne. -There you go, miss. -Thanks. -I got a tequila sunrise. -I love that! When I start drinking those, I can't stop. No tequila for you. That's when I banged her. She invited me for a week. -You're being quiet, Maurice. -Sorry, I was thinking. -It's cool. -Just great! Real nice. The cake's awesome! Dearest granddaughter, you wanted the greatest birthday of your life. I don't know 18 year-old girls too well anymore. But I remembered your grandmother Rose. When she turned 18, she got a gift that, to her, was the most beautiful. I'm talking about a ring I had given to her. And that ring, I'm now giving it to you, from your grandmother and me. So, Delphine, be beautiful and proud. Thank you, Joseph. My turn now. What are you doing, honey? I had thrown that shirt away. Hush, it's none of your business. I remember it vividly. Biarritz in August 2003. You were 6 and I was 13. The broken shell, crab and sunbeam story. -You were wearing that shirt. -We'll never forget that day. The broken shell, crab and sunbeam story. I'm wearing these clothes so you'd remember and so everything would go on as before. Don't worry, Benjamin. I'll always be by your side, I promise. How are you, champs? Tonight, no dieting allowed. This is your mother talking. And leave your competitive spirit at the door. Help yourself. Ah, my friends! How are you? -Great. And you? -Fine. And you? -Nice shirt. -You like it? -Splendid! -Thanks. We're glad you could make it. Delphine's really pleased. -You look good. -Thank you. Hi, Thomas, how are you? Go help yourself. Dad, you're elegant tonight. And you, miss, you have a ravishing gown. Thank you. -Are you scared? -Yes, a bit. Come on. Hi again. Well... Here's Philippe. -Good evening, Philippe. -Good evening. Delphine, you secretive young woman. -Are you from the area? -No, from Lille. You came especially for my daughter's birthday? That's kind of you. Delphine had never talked about you. I was curious. -You'd never talked about us? -No. -Marianne, want to dance? -Sure. Simon's in trouble. Marianne, Simon is very ill. He's got lung cancer. Excuse me. Can you play Delphine's favorite song? There we go. First of all, my sweet Delphine, my little girl, here's your gift. Your mom and I, for years, we've denied you something. And we figured we might have been wrong. So here you go. And you, pal, you have to promise me something. Don't ever pee on my records, or things won't be pleasant. Go now. Wilhelmina Delphine. I'm calling you that, as I know how much you like German philosophers and their damned existence. So, Wilhelmina Delphine, when you were born, after holding you in my arms, the first thing I did was to put a hat on your head. Then another. And then, I added a blanket. You started walking late, sweetie, when you were 2. It wasn't your fault. When you tried to stand on your legs, I'd rush to you to keep your from falling. When you were 8, you wanted to go paragliding. But you never did. I had shown you the sky was inhabited by large, winged creatures that devoured little girls. When you were 12... You wanted to go to England to improve your English, as your teacher you loved used to say, Ms. Richardson. And I proved to you that the English You never set foot in England. When you were 15, sweetie, you wanted to smoke. I got you a carton of Gitanes. I advised you to smoke them as fast as possible. Which you did. And you never smoked. Well, that's what I thought. Today, you're 18. Today, you're 18. Now, I could tell you that you may walk, you may go paragliding, you may go to England, you may smoke... But I won't say that. There's something more important. Tonight, I'll impose on you my very last restriction. Delphine Wilhelmina, Here's my very last restriction. I forbid you to die! You hear? I forbid you to die! Simon... Sorry. Simon... Will you take him with you? How do you know I'm leaving? Tonight was no birthday. It was a farewell. -Where are you going? -Lille. With Philippe. -Will we see you again? -Of course, you will! I'm just an 18 year-old who's leaving home. It's not big deal. To me, it means a lot. I know, Dad. Have a great life, honey. Take care of Benjamin, in case... Dad, what could happen to you? You're invincible. Well... What are you doing here? -I'm leaving as well. -Where are you going? -And you? -Naples. -Is it nice? -Very. Did you quit your job? Yes. Did you tell Simon? I sent him a letter. He'll get it tomorrow. That'll be a shock. But he'll survive. "Simon Wolberg, everlasting energy." What a stupid slogan! You don't like him, do you? Why did you do that to him? Actually, I like Simon. He's a pain, but we have fun together. I just hope he'll have changed a bit by next year. Why are you crying? Not because of what I said, is it? No. -It's because of Delphine. -I understand. Nothing looks like itself in this unstable world. The only thing that's stable is a secret form of violence that disrupts everything.
