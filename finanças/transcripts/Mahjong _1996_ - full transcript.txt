I think I know what you are doing right here. You've travelled a long way just for a man. Kind of admire you for that You know, this part of the world is maybe a great place for a lot of things, but maybe not the greatest place for love. If you find things are disappointing, there is still a lot that girls like you can do here. It's kinda like the wild west, then you seem to be a quick draw Look, let me know if you decide to stick around You know? You remind me a lot of myself ten years ago. Alison, would you please wait for me here? I'll be right back, OK? Sure! Hey, Marques? Don't bother coming back Don't talk like this at this place You must be bloody mad showing up here!

But you just left You left without saying a word. You just disappeared from my life. If I call back Would you? I wanted to see you face to face. I wanted to know what's happening between us, Marques. I was shut down I'd nowhere to turn. No prospects. No business. It was a bloody dead end, all right? I had to get out of London. But why didn't you come to Paris? Paris, come off it!

So you come here? How much Chinese you speak? Christ! Everybody here speaks English! Go back and try it out in Paris! I'm staying. What for? For me? How much money you've got? Where you planning to stay? Come on, where! How long do you think you'll last? Just a hotel room alone is 150 quid What are you worried about? I came by myself and I'll look after myself OK? - OK! Go on! Go ahead and do it! - Yes, I'll try it and I'll do it! Did you see where Alison went? Can't lose Alison now, can you? Bugger that! Not many girls like Marthe nowadays How old is she anyway? 16... 17? Don't get any ideas about Marthe Hey, you're talking to the next vp of international affairs I'm corporate now What ever happened to your escort service? Don't act so holy, Mr Lindsay You and I are not that different and you know it. Where are you, Hongkong? My car! How can it be like this? Damn it! It means bring mahjong to Jay? Is it alright? You are really fucking emotional You wanna be rich, use only your head Without emotion So you wanna bring someone down you should take away his emotion Don't feel it's immoral Once you get it, you won't lose then It's carriage What are you doing?

We are good guys Where do you want to go? Yeah, OK! No problem! I couldn't understand him. I didn't know he was trying to cheat me Thank you so much! What did she say? She said thanks Confucius says: 'Isn't it a delight after all to have friends come from afar?' He is happy, yeah! He is happy. How do you say THANKS in Chinese? Thanks We are all young, no need to say thank you Tell her that she should get to somewhere by bus He understands you I'm so glad! Everyone speaks English here! Are you two still in school? Are you both in high school? Why are you doing here? What was that in Hard Rock? I come to visit a friend But he is not a friend any more Ginger's business card Was Ginger the friend you want to see? Oh, no no no! I just met her She said if I need I can call her She said Ginger would look after her We all will look after her We will help you too What is your name? Marthe Sounds like the building of the subway system What company is that? Matra, Subway company Then we call her Matra Can we call you Matela? Your Chinese name Matela Yeah! No problem.

It's an interesting town Everybody seems really friendly here I think I'd like to know it better Well, I think you ought to go home Listen! Even I had a tough time making a go of it myself This place isn't for you! You don't know the place, you don't know the people There might be fun for couple of days But what about after that? What do you going to do? This is not flowers drum song around here There are not a bunch of Chinese ladies waiting to sing and dance for you the whole time, you know. The same in London? You told me to go back to Paris Now you said the same thing That's you always do in this case What is that you want, Marthe? If you need money to go home I'll give you money I'll not bother you Marques, OK? Then what were you thinking when you decided to come here? I came here to find out one thing It's that you love me or don't? If you love me, I'll wait for you If you don't, say it and I'll go away forever What's the hell does love have to do with this? Even if I say I love you, you just can't stay That means that you don't love me? If you don't love me, I'll leave tomorrow That's not I'm saying What are you saying? Get out of here! Get out and don't come back until you know what the hell you want You won't get me like this, Marthe I'll leave. But I won't be back If you insist on playing these childish games, I'll leave and you won't see me again You are the one playing childish games, Marques OK! That's how you want to... I'm off You won't see me again That's it! That woman? All the same when naked And? They are scared of AIDS I don't care about that And I don't have that Hongkong Why did you get up alone?

You don't have a husband, right? Then you go Great No! What do you wanna do then? In this world, no one knows what he wants They will thank you when you tell them what they want Haven't you seen how I persuaded her? Because women are most afraid of blaming themselves Mom, it's me What's wrong? How? Say something! Calm down, what's the matter Speak!! Don't cry Lunatic, seems something happened I have to go and take a look That bitch just wanna kiss It's ominous God damn it Damn bitch If Dad don't come to clear all these things I'll kill him when I find him Only one crystal cup broken, no big deal. No more bullshit They pointed a gun at me, you haven't seen it Today it's a crystal cup Next time..they will take my life How much is the debt? One hundred kindergartens.. You tell me how much! Does that include the bazaars? 3 billion, you know! All right, stop doing crazy things! They just hassled you, don't take it so seriously a leopard can't change its spots He must get into some women Or he wouldn't take this much money You remember that..that Angela from Hongkong I just knew him hanging around her Finally, she would be cheated So poor me But this time, he lost so much You tell me why he's hidden himself? We can get the money back in a year Right, when Mom's shopping in Paris But for that idiot to open some chain kindergartens Then everybody talked about our money It's just a Dad's duty Mom, you can think of making money too So what if I have a good idea, it's not the same as going bankrupt Except to fuck woman, there won't be any other reason Mom Don't just think about yourself, ok? Never offended your father You still don't know him..you haven't even slept with him for 20 years, it's your shame Don't make your son feel that the worst decision of his dad's is marrying you If there's some other women out there I promise you that I will get her out Don't be like this They don't even answer the phone He's coming The Son of the chain store boss Right? Never thought that his son would be like this This is a professional job Look at him Bring him here Your prophet's right My car was inexplicably broken. Luckily I wasn't in it or I would have been dead I cannot believe it. Does it have something to do with my car's color? Should ask little Buddha But for sure pink isn't a lucky color.. Could you change it? How? I just can't get my favorites. I know it's my fate This must be Angela Jay's here I'm so glad that you've come This place is so large.. This is my friend Welcome But Marques' design is first class You know Marques, that Englishman I know him Just help yourselves, please What's up, do you know them? You can't? This man Chen is her new father? How do you know that? This kind of woman, they just know about money No difference between old and young, new and old And fat ones Right, we haven't finished our chat When do you ask little Buddha to help me to see the geometric aura? Except for his good friends, he won't help others He's a friar Now you see him as an augur Listen to me If he can come, I'll give him 100 thousand How is it? I'll talk to him for you Thanks Uncle Qiu, hello Who are you? I've seen a picture of with my father. My father is that multiple shop Chen It seems that you both are members of one club Right, I often play golf with him He bets so big... 1 million once! And it's always me who takes his money What about the kindergartens? I wanted to invest, but he turned me down Do I look like a pauper? You seem excellent from any point of view How's it going with him? Long time no see Could you give me a business card, I'll get him to call you Try to control that woman Why me again? Bullshit This bitch once cheated my father Anyway you go for her When? About 10 years ago Took all my father's money Now I'll get my revenge So your dad is my cousin? All things from the little budda depend on you Angela also wants his help You and your big mouth! Little Buddha doesn't work like that Qiu has bought her a house She wants little Buddha to come and see her house Is he so like a wizard? I want to decorate the house But I always feel something strange Even I feel nervous here Wash the hair first Angela, you're lucky! Hongkong, wash the hair Son of Hongkong Must be a pretty boy from Hongkong Alison last night? Why talk about it? You are worrying me these days What to worry about? We have projects lined up next two years you can't lose her now, can you? I mean she brings at least 35% of our business just from her family connections alone We've got a lot of competitors to think about Right now you are working for me. So don't tell me how to behave But for now I'm the boss, all right? Oh it's me. It's OK! It's me you are talking to. I am here to help you Come on! What about that Marthe? What happened there? You talk to her today? It's a nightmare I went to the hotel, but she's already checked out I've no idea where she went I can see some serious shit on the horizon You watch. Marte's going to dump on me from a great height What's she want from me anyway? You can get familliar with Taipei living here Stay here is the much better way to know the city It's a waste of money to stay in those hotels Everyone here is friendly You'll find people are really friendly here Oh, I like that Take something to drink What's the matter? It's his idea I can't wait to find a job here Then I'll get to have my own place No problem Can I use that? Who? Ginger! She promised to help She should be a good place now Oh! Wait! We will handle this for her We will handle this for you It's dangerous here There will be a lot of things you don't understand There will always be trouble like the taxi driver last night Bad, OK? No problem! Why call me back? Everyone is here now Let's have a meeting first A Meeting? My hormones already rose to here Don't tell me that the blond bitch can't be fucked Remember that she is our money printer now The same as Zhongzheng Jiang You wanna fuck Zhongzheng Jiang? Take care of her Give her anything she wants She counts on only us in Taipei Only we can talk with her Later when we ask her to do what we want... she has to do it She will be under our control She will do as you tell her But she is a foreigner Let's see What's your number? It's a secret Now the dearest Matra is in my hand Is it alright? Lunlun, no emotion But Matra... Don't destroy our plan He's not satisfied with any newcomer Just do your own intepretation What about Angela? We will have dinner tonight What for? Just fuck? At least give her a triple climax From then on, she can't sleep without you The problem is about Qiu Qiu fucked her, then gave her a house So they could fuck in it Makes money also No need to pay for a hotel room You should look at it very carefully, then drive the ghosts away It needs a lot of money Till Qiu abandons her You tell her that Qiu will abandon her She will believe in you Once she believes in you, we'll be able to live a better life Dad, long time no see What's the matter? That woman took all my money I have nothing now Let her pay you back I am for you The first is 7 What about the others Go on guessing. You've got one A Guess what? Who is that? A woman I don't know... told me that Dad want to meet me Your dad turns up at last! Someone's on the phone Handle it for me. will you! Mr Chen is wanted on the line! Look! That's his son Use your head He hasn't said he'll hide away This English really sucks I thought that you should hide in some dodgy place And it would piss off when there's no sigh of wealth Seems it isn't the case You're on holiday Who's the woman that called me? It's not simple in your relationships Where is she? Can't be like that thing with Angela? Say something, ok? What do you want? You decide to re-appear or you want me to help you to go to the mainland Speak! Don't be like this I just wanna see my son, ok Please repeat it! You ran away alone when things went wrong Left your wife and your son It's a miracle that I'm still alive That's the prologue? Do you think you are an actor? And the music's playing..it's so disgusting Have you ever missed your son? They said that you are a coward, a bastard Do you know what's on my mind? I was a little boy ten years ago Now things are different. How I get on with them. Do you understand? You are my father, I can't deny that It's surely different now from what it was ten years ago Ten years ago I was cheated by Angela Bankrupt And everybody said I was a fool But one year later, I got all my money back, ..they said I was a cheat ..that I was a big liar That's because I was cheated just like the biggest fool in the world I won't be cheated if I don't trust anyone You have told me this too Nobody in the world knows what he wants Isn't it Let it go It seems that nothing changes in ten years In these ten years, you told them what you wanted, then you got your revenge You've told me that.. I should cheat someone without emotion You and I both are shameless, never have any emotion I never fail when I do as you taught me What's wrong, I've got belief in you. Why have you become so weak? Dad, you only need make an appearance Those idiots outside will still listen to you Because they still don't know what they want Dad, cheer up! I can help you We'll do it together? How about that? Good idea, huh? Do you want more? Is that enough? When you are as rich as me you'll find out that what you want is the thing that money can't buy When I die, there is nothing left but money I'm the poorest in the world. I thought that it would be easy to cheat on 3 year old kids Then everybody invested That's because they don't know what I am thinking of and what I want So what do you want? What's the thing that money can't buy? Say it! I can say it for you Women. Right? Dad, I know you too well! No excuse. Just fickle with your affections Idiots like Jay, how could he afford a foreign designer You are still young! You don't understand I'm young! I know nothing! What were you doing at 17 I can feed my friends all by myself I won't spend my money just on women like you Don't pretend to be so piteous Get out right now! Otherwise I'll tell everyone you are here I'm busy tonight. You should call me first Where are you going? Where? Where should I wait? Why do you never tell me where you are? But we are in love! I'll go with you I just met you a day ago But you said you love me I love you. I really love you! Go home and wait for my call if you really love me May I wait at your place? No. Wait for me at home When will you be back? Those women often go for facials to make themselves look younger Just a waste of money So what? You see how young she is I can give you a lot of help if you need it I know everything about Taipei You need me, I know this town. I guess I'm learning something tonight. She doesn't believe you... We are in control of Matra She trusts us You want Marthe? You talk to me. I'm the only one in this town she trusts. Really? Then, I'm listening? Then Our rule's called 3-7, understand? Say it This is how we do it. We call it 3-7 What 70 for me & 30 for you, right? She 70..you 30 Don't kid around! Look, we haven't even got to first base yet How do I even know you have Marthe? She wants to make sure She trusts me, not you I don't believe it Bring her here! Just go! Go go go! What are you waiting for? Bring Matra here No problem! How did it go? Ginger wants to see you... Great, It's nice to have people to help you I don't think you should go. Why? I need a job. I have to have a job I can do many things, I never needed my parents I've been on my own since I was 14 Come on. I'm excited I don't think I should take you What's wrong with you, come on, let's go You don't want to do that kind of job I'll do anything. - You can't do this What do you mean I can't do it, I can do anything Don't tell me it's prostitution or something like that Let's go What are you talking about? I decided to came here, I decided to stay, I decide what kind of job to take I want him to make him regret this I can't take you - - Just tell me where they are then. - No. I can't That's my problem! Has nothing to do with you! You just do your job as a lousy interpreter Ok. I'm sorry Just tell me what happened I'm new to all this When I first saw you at the Hardrock I just feel that you are different Tonight at the Hardrock I passed the same spot where you ran into me Then I thought of you So they are in the Hardrock? I can't do it. I guess I can't stay here either right Hungry? Yes Hungry, then wanna eat me? Kiss me I never do kissing What? Never been kissed? You just do it as soon as you get on the bed It's why you don't understand that kind of feeling Kissing's very romantic, can make two people closer More excited Try it Kiss me once. I'm hungry! A man will go off the rails if he kisses someone What? Go to hell! Every man who has kissed me drives a Benz What? A Benz Where's Matra? Can't find her Well? She's gone Fuckin' bitch Didn't she say she would wait for us? I think you ought to pay for the drinks Nowaday, you can't fuckin' trust anyone Why did she betray me? Are you hiding something from me? What? No Anyhow, I never concede to let anyone do anything I know I only say this to you once Why are you so emotional? I'm always listening to you, helping you translate These are all tips my father taught me to make someone successful I treat you as my friend so I can tell you that Did you see your father? He said there're only two kinds of people in this world Bilker and mutt Which one you are is your own choice Everyone thinks he's a big cheat In fact What?

Why didn't you tell me earlier? This is good, hey? Going bankrupt is good, isn't it? It's 50 or 60 square metres It's worth less than 10000000 It's nothing compared with the money he owed What's wrong? Stop! Nowadays, kids all go crazy What? Don't get too near, call the police! When did he die? The body's just been found Don't be sad Don't be angry Come over right now I didn't do it! By themselves or others, do you know that? Where does he live? Wait! Line 397, No 25 Dad!

I don't want to waste any time Don't cry! It's not a tragedy! You make me want to cry too Hey, think about it... Lunlun's gone, and that one can't stop crying What should I do? It's all because of women You must have kissed her It's for real! I told you not to kiss them Why? What's wrong? OK, I'll go! It's all the little budda's fault! He said there was a ghost in the house, then Angela went away You have another house You must be joking No bullshit Thank you indeed! I tried, but always failed Angela is better than me She never gives without getting something first Really? Am I going to cheat you? I owed her much money, so had to give her this house for the debt She believed the little budda Then she regretted it... You tell little Buddha, change the geometric aura here It depends on you! It has nothing to do with me! Please help me this time We can share the money Listen to me Is it just me who can spot this idea? We create an accident when little Buddha's doing his divination Then we could get a lot of money when those idiots see that what the prophet said has become a reality! Nobody knows what they want nowadays So many people watch TV, the ads, read the magazines just to find out what they really want They do what we want to them to.. But that's not enough.. You can try the chains I'm not interested Wait! This could make a lot of money! It sucks! What? Making money is trash now? Listen to me! I told you I'm not interested! I beg you! I'm going bankrupt Just like your father Help me Have you ever imagined that you get this face when you die, regret? We are busy making money when we are alive Why think about death You never thought about death? I'll give you the chance Let you taste death How's that? Can you feel it? Do you have the feeling of death now? I'll give all the money to you Money?? What about that feeling of death? Live or die, it's no difference to you? Don't kill me! It's up to you Forgive me! Now you regret that you use your life only to make money? I don't wanna you die with any questions We will all be fine if you are friendly Don't you have many ways to make money? How come it has come to this confounded idea? Let me see my son for the last time He is as young as you Son Why didn't you think about your son until now? Why do you bring him here but leave him alone? You are just like your father, so damn hateful Don't shoot, please! I don't want to die! You won't die like this I'll call the ambulance first You cheated on my dad with Angela? You misunderstood it! That Angela went to the US long ago There are tens of thousands of Angelas in Hongkong That's funny, that's really funny. Those bucks call you Martra? Do you know why Martra's so well known here? It's not because it knows how to build an underground for these people. It's because it knows how to tell these people what they want. These people shelled out four times the going rate for a metro that still doesn't work These people have so much money stuffed up their ass.. its' beyond belief You know, in ten years this place will be the centre of the world The future of western civilization lies right here And you know what the odd thing is... ..the 19th century with the glorious age of imperialism, right? Just wait till you see the 21st century That's why Martra is here, and that's why I'm here, Marthe I was so lucky to end up here and I've no intention.. Of telling anyone back home about it, I'm so glad you've come here I miss you so much, there's so much I want to share with you, Martre This, this is where I like to go Hold on a second, I'd like to buy something I'll be right back It has nothing to do with us I really don't want to kill Just let go. Think about yourself I'm different from him I won't leave my friends Hongkong won't either You never kiss a woman from now on! Kissing is unlucky! Hongkong became what he is now just because of kissing We are still friends It's hard to have a time like this You go on the same Please don't act like that That's what friends are, isn't it? Not like a stray dog I'm the boss Who's going to need you? We can try alone It's ridiculous. Why be so rude? You treat me like that precisely because you need me It's you that needs me! Why am I so hapless.. Everyone shouts at me What's wrong with that woman? I never think of that... you need me Women again! Ever slept with her? You must have been kissed once more! Angry again! What's wrong with you? With that lifeless face! Just beaming What are you talking about, man? Just made a friend. What's it to you? She looks French That girl - she came to find you just now... She's gone now
