Good afternoon, miss. Good afternoon. Is that it? That's it, right enough, miss. Granny calls it the devil's work. Well, I can't say I've ever heard it called that before. Stand back now. Did you know if you touch it your hair stands on end? You are not going anywhere near it, young lady. [BELL RINGING] Cone on. Is it true you've being sacked, sir? No, it's not true, Fenton. Tuck that shirt in, please. So why are you leaving before the end of term, sir? That is for me and the head master to know and for you to wonder at, Smith. But there's definitely no more Greek. Fred Johnson, there is definitely no more Greek. Head Master, in his wisdom, has decided there are more useful subjects to study. Come on, hurry up, all of you. Classes start in one minute. Where would you like it, Mrs. Spence? Where do people usually put it? Well, it would normally go in your sitting room. Well, that's no entirely helpful in a house like this. What do you think? Library, drawing room, morning room, stamp room, old parlor? Let's put it in the drawing room for now. This way. Is it easy to work? I would suggest that I discuss the technical details with Mr. Spence. Well, he's in London. Besides, my brother-in-law can barely broil a kettle. I don't think he'll be much use. [KNOCKING] Do you need any help, sir? No, thank you, Seadan, I think I can manage. Run along. I'm glad there are no hard feelings, John. It was a difficult decision. But Major Huldon has a young family. Yes, of course, Head Master, and French conversation is a more practical subject for the boys. I see that. Is that all you're taking? Oh, it's all I need. So a walking tour? Yes, I thought I'd see a bit of the world, what's left of it. I've always wanted to visit-- Quite. Romance of the road and all that. Yes. Are you sure I can't call you a taxi? No. Thank you, thought I'd start [INAUDIBLE] to go on. My train isn't until 6:00. Well. Au revoir. Right. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I-- Here's your change, sir, and your room is ready whenever you are. I don't-- I don't think this is-- [TOILET FLUSHING] Hello? Hello? Bloody hell. You're not the devil, by any chance, are you? No. But I think this might be your change. Thank you. Come into the light so I can get a proper look at you. The landlord thought that I-- Well, you can hardly blame the poor chap. That is incredible. Don't you think? I mean, who the hell are you? John. John Standing. Who are you? Johnny Spence. Pleased to meet yo-- no, completely astonished to meet you. Do you have time for a quick one? You must have. Come on, my shell. We'll probably discover we got dozens of cousins in common. Do you have many cousins? No, not really. I have a whole heard of them. Don't get one with a single one, scroungers, the lot of them. Thank you. That's you. Thank you, Mr. Spence. This should keep us going. You're not rich by any chance, are you? No. Not at all. I owned a brothel once in Paris. I had a set of twins that cost a 1,000 francs an hour. I don't think we're quite in that league yet. Circus, maybe. Cabaret. What do you think? Cheers, anyway. So where are you from? Wales. Hm. Father? -Dead now. Worked down the mines all his life. Oh, you don't sound like a taff. My dad wanted me to go to university. It was his dream, so I went out before the war, got my degree, and came back talking like a bishop as he used to say. Well, then, we're definitely not related. I never passed an exam in my life. Smoke? Thank you. So what about family? Married? -No. No, I'm not. You must have some relations. Just a maiden aunt in Fishguard. Hm. You lucky dog, you haven't met her. What I wouldn't give to be in your position. To your freedom, long may it last. Is there enough? There's plenty. But there's still no word from him? No. Something's happened, I know it. This will stop your worrying. Mrs. Paul thinks that he's missed the train. Oh, what would she know? Nobody in this house understands my son except me. Johnny doesn't like to fail. They're happy about the booze as long as we drink out of these. I've spoken to the kitchen, ordered two large steaks, very well done, and mashed potato and gravy. Cheers. Cheers. Hm, so a walking tour. The open road is your oyster and all that. Yes, I have a few ideas. How about you? Funk. Complete funk. Had a bugger of a day in town. I was on the train on the way back, and I thought what the hell am I doing? Going home like a lamb to the slaughter, so off I got. Here I am. What about your family? Won't they be worried? Oh, about me, never. About themselves, definitely. Waiter, more of your delicious tea. You know, greed. That's what makes the world go around. Men, women, children. Whatever you do, it's never enough, is it? No one's ever satisfied. Doesn't take much to satisfy me. Well, you're lucky. The world's your playground. Mine hangs around my neck like a rope. Ignore me. It's not every day you get a chance to talk to yourself without being carted off to the funny farm. I'm actually rather enjoying it. I'll do this. It is extraordinary us meeting like this, isn't it? Yes, I suppose it is. I mean, don't you think there's something special about now. This moment between the death of one monarch and the coronation of the next? What do you mean? Well, anything's possible. The throne is empty. No one's in charge. To anarchy. To anarchy. Is that Daddy's plate? I hardly touched it. He'll be cross with you. I know. Give me the and I'll tell him it was me. Then he'll be cross with you. I think there's a place in town where we can get it mended. Then he'll never know at all. Of course, Plato believed that every man was split in half by Zeus so that he couldn't compete with the gods, which means if you think about it, everyone has a twin somewhere in the world. It's just a question of looking for them. You're not a professor, are you? Teacher-- ex. Teach-- oh, what time is it? I have to get to the station. We've got plenty of time. Anyway, all your things are at the pub. We left them there. Come on. Sir. Your coats, sir. Oh, yes, well done. Thank you, that's mine. That's his. I can't wear this. Of course, you can. I haven't worn one of these since I was 10. Look at that, perfect fit. I could have been made for you. What is that you said about the gods? When they keep us apart, we're nothing but together. We can rule the world. [TRAIN WHISTLE] Well, what's the verdict? There isn't one. -What do you mean? -Exactly that. We haven't heard. He's disappeared. He checked out of his club in London yesterday morning, and he was booked on the 12:15. George was there to meet the train. He wasn't on it or the three that followed. And he didn't telephone the house? If we're to keep to the plan, I should issue notices this morning. It's going to be a hell of a business. Yes, I know that, Arthur. But now we just have to wait. I can't give you authorization without him. You know what my brother's like. It's ridiculous this rule about not having a fire in the morning. What's the point of economizing on wood when we live in the middle of a forest? Perhaps you'd have a word with Charlotte? And have hr give we one of her black looks? No, thank you. Anyway, it's your responsibility. I've had some fresh toast made up for you, Miss Spence. Thank you, Charlotte. Mr. Spence has just telephoned from a public house in Peterborough. What's he doing there? It's a bit early, even for Johnny. He had to stay the night there. He was feeling indisposed. Did he say anything about the contract? No. Will that be all, Mrs. Spence? Yes, Charlotte, thank you. He won;t be back for hours now. Inconsiderate bastard. [KNOCKING] Who is it? GEORGE: It's me, sir. George. Oh my god. I'm sorry, who is it? GEORGE: Could you please open the door, sir? It's locked. GEORGE: Perhaps you might consider unlocking it, sir. No, it's-- Um I-- I think you must have the wrong room. Don't worry, we'll have you out of here in a jiffy, sir. Let me help you get dressed. -What? No, thank you. I think I'm quite capable of dressing myself. Please, I'll be quite all right. Shall I get you some coffee then, sir? No. I'm so sorry, that was, um, that was very rude. I just need to find my things. GEORGE: I understand, sir. I'm sorry, someone seems to have stolen my clothes. I made you one of my specials. Right. Um, I think I should-- Back in one, sir. Always the best way. That's very good. What is it? Was it? Vodka mainly, sir. Just how you like it. Thank you. Um, look, you should get the landlord up here. I really need to sort this out. -Don't worry, sir. I've had a word and his discretion is assured. Fine. I'll do it myself. Ah, just the man. Look, the fellow I met last night has run off with all my things. I can't find my wallet. I can't-- Don't worry, sir. You settled everything very generously last night. No, no, the man who paid last night, wasn't me. I mean, we swapped coats but-- Don't upset yourself, Mr. Spence. I'm not upset, and I'm not Mr. Spence. I'll just put your things in the car, Mr. Spence. No. Put them wherever you want. They're not my things. Wait here. Look, um, I'm not who you think I am. Look, you could ask me any question you want. I wouldn't know the answer. I don't even know who you are. Don't-- my god. That's a Silver Wraith. That's incredible. Four speed transmission, coach work by Hooper, am I right? It's beautiful. You intending to drive, sir? -Could I? -Of course. If you want to? Oh, my god. I'm-- I'm so sorry. I didn't-- I didn't-- Perhaps it would be better if I drove, sir. I'm s-- I-- I didn't see-- oh my goodness. I'll pay for the damages, of course. All will be all right once we get you back. I'm so s-- We'll be home before you know it. Yes. I'm-- Johnny? Johnny! -Sorry? I haven't got time to talk, Johnny. It's the Williamson dinner at 6:00. One of us has to be there. What the devil's happened to the back of the car, George? Entirely my fault, sir. Well, it can come out of your wages. Come on! I've got to go. Would you please stop shouting. It wasn't George's fault. It was mine. I've said, I'll pay for the damage. I haven't got time for this. I'll take your bag upstairs, sir. Thank you. Daddy. You're back. I've missed you so much. I have terrible news. Mrs. Simpson is dead. Mrs. Simpson is dead? That is terrible news. You don't look very upset. No, no, I am, I am. I didn't even know she was ill. Would you come up and see her after my bath? You mean, she's here? Of course, I told Father McReady he couldn't bury her until you came back. You just have to promise that you'll come up. I promise. Yes, it's him. Darling? God, you look a mess. Where on earth have you been? He really was ill. Well, you might at least apologize. We've been waiting all day for you to show. I was so worried. Aren't you going to kiss either of us? Look, um, there's been a mistake. I met, um, whoever you think I am last night and we had a few drinks, too many drinks, I'm afraid. And then this morning when I woke up, he had stolen my clothes and my luggage and my wallet and taken off without any explanation. Anyway, I came here this afternoon to find out exactly what was going on. He's been drinking. I can smell it from here. I'm going up to change for dinner. Come on, Frances. Did you talk to Paul? He's been in a state all day about the contract. Is he the one who was just rude to me? It's not funny. You might at least have telephoned. There you are, Mr. Spence. Her ladyship has asked me to send you up at the moment that you arrive. I'm not Mr.-- Please don't keep her waiting. We were expecting you yesterday, and she's getting quite anxious. Was there anything else you wanted? No, no, nothing at all. I am, of course, going upstairs. Annie? Oh my god. What are you doing? Um. Are you mad? Everyone's getting changed for dinner. The servants are everywhere. Annie is just getting me some shampoo. She'll be back any minute. You are an idiot. Come and find me after dinner. Paul won't be back till late, I made sure of that. [KNOCKING] Annie, dear, um, can you come and help me? I want it properly rubbed in. Yes, madame. You disgust me. Her ladyship was most insistent on seeing you immediately, sir. Right. She's expecting you for supper. Why don't I take this from you, and you lead the way. Shall i? You beastly boy. Come and give your mother a kiss. Father McReady, would you think me rude if I cut short our little game so that I can talk to my prodigal here? No, of course not. So what's the tally now? I think I to a fourpence. Ah, very thrilling. We must make a note of that so that we don't forget. Now, where's my little book. Well, I'm sure you and Johnny have a great deal to discuss. [LATIN] Good to have you safe at home, Johnny. Enjoy your dinner. Thank you. Come and sit beside me. What's the matter? You look ill. What have you done with your tie? I'm sorry, I'm feeling a little-- Hangover? Serves you right. I suppose you found some little tart to amuse yourself with last night. Though goodness knows why you had to go to Peterborough to find one. So did you settle with the Levertons? Did you agree the new contract? Don't play the fool with me, Johnny. Did you or didn't you? Yes, I did. Good. Oh, I knew you could manage it. Paul is such a baby. I knew that if you talked to them, you'd make them see it our way. You're a Spence. The only one in this house, as far as I'm concerned. Now, where's my present? Johnny, I'm not in the mood. I need it. We expected you yesterday. [KNOCKING] That'll be Annie, ma'am. I trust you haven't let me down. Now, tell us what's happening in London? Who did you see? What's the gossip? I don't see why you are acting so surprised. When has he ever behaved any differently? Perhaps he really was ill. Oh, don't be so bloody naive. Well, I think I'll go up and leave you to it. Tell Charlotte, if you ever see her again, that I won't be needing anything else. Goodnight. I'm sorry. It's all right. I'm fine. You have to stand up to my brother, otherwise he just takes advantage. Yes, I know. I think I'll go up too. Goodnight. Goodnight. Do you have it? Her present. Shall we get it? That would be the one. We merely ran out. We were expecting you yesterday. Is that all you got? It's not going to last very long. [CRYING] Ah! You gave me a fright. I'm so sorry. Standing there in the dark, I thought-- I'm sorry. It's entirely my fault. No, I shouldn't have just barged in. I thought you were still with your mother. I'm sorry. Would you undo me? Please? I was so worried. I thought something must have happened. Did it? Did what? Something happen? No. Oh. Good. Thank you. Did you speak to Piglet? Who? She was waiting up for you. You all right? You're very quiet. Would you like me to run you a bath? You must be exhausted. No. No. Thank you. How are you? All right, I suppose. Charlotte is being beastly to everyone and it seems to be my fault, of course. I don't see Piglet from one day to the next. She's leads a completely secret life. Did you say anything to her, by the way? She's been acting particularly oddly since you left. What about you? How was it? The business with the contract? Oh, um, let's not talk about that now. Of course. I'll be done in a minute. I know I'm going on and you hate that. Darling, I-- What? What? No, it's nothing. You said darling. I'm being silly. Ignore me. Sorry. I think I'll pop out for a while. I'm not very tired. Do you have to? Yes. What the hell are you doing? I'm just popping out for some air. I left my door open for you. You've been away over a week. I wanted to see you. Why do you think I told Paul to go to that dinner by himself? I thought we could spend some time together. Goodness, it's hard enough in this mad house. Would you rather spend the evening with your mother? I didn't have much choice. Well, so I thought you'd come to me straight afterwards. Instead of wandered around like a ghost in the middle of the night. Can we talk about this in the morning? You can be a real bastard, you know that. I'm very s-- Don't touch me. It's no good now, there's no time anyway even by our pathetic standards. [CAR DRIVING UP] See, that's him now. Go on, go. Get some bloody air and leave the rest of us to suffocate. You didn't come and say goodnight. That hurt. MARY LOU: You promised. I'm sorry. If you don't come up by the time I count to 50, I swear I'm going to jump. Get back inside now. Don't say I didn't warn you. 1, 2-- Get back inside. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9-- You're lucky I'm not dead. What on earth do you think you're doing? You said you'd come up. I was busy. I'm very sorry. You promised. JOHN: I said, I was sorry and I am. Very well. I forgive you. Kiss? You smell funny. What sort of funny? Funny like a doctor. I thought you were never coming back too. Why? Because you said if things got too difficult, you'd disappear. Hm. Stop! What's the matter? Mrs. Simpson. Oh, Mrs. Simpson, the goldfish. Oh. She's certainly dead. What would you have done if I had disappeared? Topped myself. You don't even know what that means. Of course, I do, silly. Children don't kill themselves. Then why did you run upstairs so fast just now? Because you might have slipped. I was holding on. Now, pass Mr. Rabbit. Thank you. Now you can tuck me in and make me snuggly. You can promise not to do anything silly like that again. Only if you promise. What? That you'll never go away and leave me. Um, look, I can't make that promise, I'm afraid. Well, you must just hope for the best that you stay in town and I stay alive. If I do have to go away, whatever the reason, I promise I'll tell you first. Cross your heart and hope to die? Cross my heart and hope that neither of us have to die. Now, go to sleep. Eek. Eek. What's that? Mr. Rabbit saying goodnight to you. Goodnight. Is that you? Yes. Yes, it's me. Is this for me? It says F for Frances. Oh, well, I suppose so. Can I open it? It's beautiful. Did you have it made specially? I love it. Thank you. Will you put it on for me? Yes, of course. [KNOCK] Morning, sir. Mr. Spence, I hope I'm not disturbing you. Not at all. I'll go and get dressed. Right. Oh, thank you, George. Where is everyone? Your brother's at the foundry, sir. He's expecting you at 10:00. Your sister and Mrs. Paul are at breakfast. And her Ladyship? Indisposed, sir, and likely to remain so for the rest of the day. I found this in your waistcoat Polk pocket, sir. Ah, good morning, Annie. Good morning, sir. I was just on my way to breakfast. Oh, sorry, Mr. Spence. Thank you. Morning. What are you doing? Nothing. Can you please have a word with Charlotte about having a fire in the morning? It's ridiculous that there isn't one. Would you like me to light one? You enjoy your fresh air last night? Yes, thank you. Daddy brought presents for everyone and Mommy got a locket with a picture of his face on it. -I'm not sure you should be-- -Is this one for me? It says ML on it. Well-- And, this is for you, and for Auntie Nina, and for Auntie Blanche. And my one. "Charlotte's Web." Just as I wanted. Thank you. Pleasure now. I suppose you think that's funny. You really don't care about anyone, do you? Except for yourself. Can I open her present? No, you can't George is waiting out front, sir, when you're ready. Thank you. Coming now. Can I have it? Absolutely not. To my darling, B. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Isn't it pretty? But stinks. May I offer my congratulations, sir? What for? The Leverton contract. Your mother gave Mr. Paul the good news this morning. Ah. There'll be quite a celebration tonight, sir. Good job, sir. I'm sorry, I couldn't keep it a secret. Thank you, sir. It's been like Christmas. I don't think anyone has done a scrap of work all day. Come on, how did you do it? I just couldn't believe it. I hardly know myself. It's incredible that they accepted our terms. -Well done, sir. -Thank you. Thank you. Have you got the contract? No, not with me. But you did sign it? There are some details to finalize but they'll sent it on. A letter arrived for you this morning. That's probably it. Listen, I want to hear the whole story, but I've got to go into town and see the bank. I had a rather tricky meeting with Old Thornton while you were away. Congratulations, sir. Oh, thank you. Arthur, can you make sure everyone gets back to work? Sorry about last night. I'd have a bit of a spat with Nina. I wasn't quite myself. Jolly well done. I really mean that. Just the sort of thing your father would have pulled off, if you don't mind me saying so, sir. I felt, well, that sometimes you didn't understand the lives of the men and women here. I'm happy to admit I was wrong. It's a terrible thing for a man to have no work. Yes, I know. We will need some funds by next week to cover the wages. The accounts all here, sir. Mr. Paul and I went through everything ourselves yesterday. And again, congratulations, sir. Thank you. Don't worry, I'll get him. Darling, you haven't even changed and it's half past 7:00. Everyone's about to go in. I'm not very hungry. What are you doing? Trying to understand these reports about the glass works. I thought that was Paul's job. I'd like to understand them myself. You still have to eat. A sandwich maybe, a glass of water. You are in an odd mood. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's rather nice to have to look after you for a change. We could take a picnic upstairs. Just us. I'll tell them I'm not feeling well. They're used to that. I used to have to stop boys from having midnight feasts. Here I am eating one. I didn't know you were a prefect. I wasn't. I mean, I was, I just wasn't a very good one. Charlotte finds out about all this, I'm dead. So is Annie. She caught me red-handed in the larder, but I managed to persuade her that my cause was just. She's very excited at the news about the foundry. So clever to have managed that. Trouble is, I haven't. Oh. That's why I was reading all those papers. Did you know there was a report before the war commissioned by my sister from a chap called A. Far? Alice Far. Well, actually, it's rather good, as a matter of fact. Why don't you get back to your papers while I get all this cleared up? -Oh, let me help. -No. Thank you. I'd rather do it myself. -No, please-- I mean it. What are these doing here? I was reading them last night. It's a bit late, isn't it? Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't know what I was doing. Really? I think you knew exactly what you were doing. What would you have done? What would I have done? Well, I probably wouldn't have seduced my sister-in-law, for starts. About the Leverton contract. What would you have done if they hadn't refused to accept our terms? -Well, what does it matter now? They've signed, haven't they? -But if they hadn't, what then? I would have done anything to keep the furnaces burning, you know that. It's madness to rely on a single contract. You should never have allowed us to be in this position. Daddy wouldn't have stood for it. I've read that report last night, and I didn't fully understand it, but he seemed to take it seriously. He did until you told him not to. Are these Alice's designs? You complete shit. Crockett wants to know about the shoot on Sunday. He's suggesting starting at the Bagley End this year and driving up towards Moorcroft. They walked it yesterday morning. They said the ground's solid. He'll be here at 11:00 to go over it with you. Sounds good. I have to go into town at 10:00, so maybe you could take care of it? Of course. If that's what you want. And I have a hair appointment. We can go in together. I'll just go and get ready. I'll see to Crockett then. Do you have to go in? I have some things to sort out in the bank. You'll find them much more amenable. They're very pleased about the contract. Good. Yes, Mayfair 242. I'd like to speak to Sir Matthew Leverton. It's Mr. Spence from Century Glass. Well, you'll have to interrupt the meeting. This is very important. He'll want to hear it personally. May I come into town with you? I'm going on business. Please, it's really important. Second thoughts, that's a very good idea. Of course, you can come. Sorry we're late. Mary Lou is coming with us. Very important mission apparently. Nothing I could do. We need to talk. Yes, of course. Alone. Right. -Can I sit in the front? -Yes. Where are you going? Argyle Street, that junk shop. Right. Look after her. Yes. I think this is the last one. That's everything we have. -You sure? Yes. I'm sue, but I really think it would be best to discuss any queries you may have with Mr. Thornton when he returns next week. There's definitely nothing else? No other account? No, sir. That's everything. What's this? There seems to be something in this account. Quite a lot, in fact, 1 million pounds. I'm so sorry, sir. This account is in the wrong file. I shouldn't have brought it out. It says Spence at the top. That's because it's your wife's trust fund. Are you saying that's gone as well? No, sir, the principle sum has not yet been paid out because of the terms of the marriage settlement. What terms? Perhaps I can make an appointment-- Do you know who I am? Of course, Mr. Spence. Well, there can hardly anything irregular about discussing the terms of my own marriage settlement, can there? No, sir, I suppose not. Well? Well, I'm not completely familiar with the document, but my understanding is that the money is only to be paid out in the event of your wife conceiving a male heir. Unless, of course, she should predecease you. A male heir. Sir Alfred was most insistent. So a granddaughter wasn't good enough for him. It would appear not, sir. Thank you, Mr. Myerson, my coat. There is one other thing, there's a painting up at the house, I'd like it valued. Yes, sir, I'm sure that can be arranged. You've been most helpful. Sorry, excuse me, do you know where Argyle Street is? Um, I'm looking for a little girl, my daughter. Upstairs. Thank you. What are you doing here? I'm looking for a little girl. The gentleman downstairs indicated-- You should never send a child here. It shows lack of respect for your family. I've missed you. Where is she? The child? She left half an hour ago with the chauffeur. So did your wife like her [INAUDIBLE]? Did she think I painted a good likeness of you? Uh, yes, yes, she-- she-- um, she loved it, as a matter of fact. So she's happy? And what about me? Did you find Bella's little present? The perfume? Yes, did you find it? I gave it to my sister. Why? Does she still hate you? Why? It was a mistake. That must have been a surprise for her. Yes, it was. Did it make her happy? No, it didn't. Then we are both unhappy. What are you going to do about this? Where's your father? Still in the bank. Well, I'm not waiting. George can come back for him. Get in. And take that out of your mouth. That little girl of yours is adorable. Yes, she is. Why was she here? Because she wants me to mend something for her. A plate from your regiment. She thinks you will be angry it is broken. So that's the big secret. You're not angry? No, why should I be? She seemed to expect it. She loves you, but she fears you also. The truth is, I'm the one who should be afraid. She almost jumped out of a window because I didn't say goodnight. I think she loves me. It's quite an unusual feeling. You're in a strange mood. Did something happen in London? What do you mean? I don't know, you seem different. You were different just now. How? Not sure. Gentler, perhaps. I liked that. People change. That's not so usual. I'm the proof. I don't think we know what we're capable of until we're given the opportunity. That I do believe. I have seen what people are capable of if they are given the opportunity. That's why I'm here. Why are you here? We agreed, no stories. Please, I'd like to know. You would not understand. The English do not know what it is like to be occupied by an enemy. I'm sorry. Don't be. That was a long time ago. But now, you are the hero of war with your plate from your regiment to their brave Captain. I don't feel very brave. You're ticklish. You've been lying to me all that time. I told you, people change. You mean, ticklish one day and not ticklish the next? I don't think that's possible. How did you know I was here? They said at the bank that you left before lunch. I thought I might find you here. Oh, I see. Now, there's a funeral to attend, sir, and I'm under the very strictest of instructions to ensure that you're not late. Our Father in Heaven, who notices even the falling of a sparrow, must surely then have noted the untimely passing of Mrs. Simpson. We commend her to his care and ask his comfort for those on Earth who mourn her passing. In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Amen. Throw some on there. Come on, Piglet, I think it's an early bed for you tonight. Do fishes go to heaven? I'm sure they do. There are rather a lot of them. If you'll excuse me, I need a chance to even the score with your own mother before she has her rest. Could I possibly have a word with the first, Father? Yes, of course. It's true a priest cannot reveal the secrets of a confession? That is correct. Can I make one? Now? Please? Well, it is possible. God's ear is everywhere. How do I begin? Dear me, Johnny, I know it's a long time, but you must remember. We learned it together. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It is a very long time since my last confession. This is going to be a little unusual. I think it already is. I want to talk about me and my sister. I see. Go on. I think you understand why. I do, I do. Do I? Oh, that unfortunate girl. Glass designer. Yes. Yes, that's exactly it. Alice, isn't that her name? Alice Far. Quite terrible. Quite terrible. I think, in some ways, what happened was my fault. It certainly was not. The coroner was very clear that no one in the family was in any way to blame. The girl was of unsound mind with no respect for the sanctity of her own life. Your sister, as you know, took it very personally. Too personally, in my view, and your mother agreed. And then, of course, there was the very sad business, as in the poor child never drew a breath, of course, but because of the girl's selfish act, it could not enter the presence of God because it carried the stain of mortal sin. Surely, if there was sin, it was that of the father. The father, whoever he was, had, of course, sinned, but he can be forgiven. He would just need to confess and be given absolution. And can he be forgiven for what he did? Of course. You can be forgiven for anything provided you make a proper act of contrition. Thank you, Father, that was very helpful. But that wasn't a confession. No, no. Would you mind awfully if I had some time alone with my mother this evening? No, no, of course not. My vow was poverty. Thank you. [KNOCKING] How was the funeral? Very moving. I heard about your performance at breakfast, made me laugh. What are you thinking giving your sister perfume? I wasn't thinking. Anyway, Francis loves her locket. Why this sudden concern for that barren stick of a girl? She's not barren. She has a very beautiful daughter. Exactly, and that nearly killed her. Sometimes, I wish it had. No, you don't. Don't I? Don't pretend you haven't thought of it yourself. If she died, you needn't have worried about a son. You'd have inherited everything in the family and the foundry would have been safe, which is why we chose her in the first place. Is it? Well, you know it is. Well, if we want to keep the foundry safe, we have to pay the wages. So I'm thinking of selling the Vermeer in the study. Really? You don't mind? Of course, I don't mind. Although, I don't see how it will help. It's a fake, as you well know. You've left it a little late to play the saint, my dear. The best pictures went long ago with the land. So how do you expect to survive. I don't. It's the end for houses like this. No one can support them anymore. And look at poor Freddy Thin opening Longleat to the public. Well, I don't intend to be around to see strangers gawping at this house. Zeus once decided to punish a king by setting out a huge feast in front of him every day, but each time the king reached for something to eat, a winged harpy snatched it away from him and so he starved in the face of plenty. There's a banquet in front of you here, there are no harpies, but you're all still starving. The inevitable has to be accepted. Does it? Or is the inevitable something that comes in a syringe of morphine? I take my pleasure where I can, just as you take yours. What if we stopped, both of us, just for one day? Why don't you come down and greet your guests tomorrow at the shoot? This house needs you. It's too late to change. We are what we are. Well, I can't see anything at all. It's like that night we drove into Inverness on our honeymoon. Oh my goodness, there's a man. Oh, what is he saying? You have to turn up the sound control. Oh, yes, sorry. TV ANNOUNCER: Stamping out new coins for the coming coronation of Queen Elizabeth. The design of the new coins has already aroused spirited controversy with some commentators saying that Her Majesty looks too girlish. Oh. I'm sorry, there's something I want to say. I haven't been strictly truthful with you all. I didn't do a deal with Leverton's in London last week. I did one this morning. It isn't a very good arrangement. In fact, it's pretty bad from our point of view. So it was a lie all along. Why? I was a coward, and what I should have done-- what I'm trying to do now is ask for your help. It's a bit late for that, don't you think? I don't see what we can do. We shut it down. That's his plan. Abandoning the foundry won't save us, and even if it did, what kind of life would it be if we can eat but everyone else is hungry? That's not something that bothered you before. So what are you suggesting? We find a way to raise some finance to keep us going while we come up with another plan. I read Far's Foss report last night, and I think it could work. PAUL: You said it was completely impractical. I was wrong. Well, Blanche will never agree. I don't understand what you're trying to do. Make it better. Well, you can't. I have to try. Blanche, no one can bring Alice back. Don't you dare bring Alice into this. You know nothing about her. You never understood her for a single second. Do you remember when you set fire to my dolls' house? You did it because I loved it. Because it was mine, because you were jealous, just like you always are, jealous of anything you can't have. Well, Daddy can't go out and buy a new one and make it better this time. I know that. She loved me. That's what you couldn't bear, wasn't it? So you had to have her. Alice wasn't like us. She had no idea how people like us could behave. You drove her mad. And because of me and what I had done, she felt she couldn't turn to anyone. Not even you. You may not believe it, but I know how that feels, and I think you do too. We can't bring Alice back, but we can think about what she might have wanted. We can make the ideas she believed in real and that way something survives. That's new, isn't it? No, no, no, I just haven't worn it for a while. Can you turn the light out, please? Yes. Oh, not now. Your Ladyship? Not tonight. I feel too tired to be tired. If you're sure. I just wanted to say goodnight. Goodnight. I liked your speech. Thank you. You're a very surprising man. I don't think my sister was very impressed. Give her time. Do you think you can find the money? I don't know, but I intend to try. I just wish there was a way I could help. You have. I wouldn't have had the courage to say anything without you. Goodnight. J? Yes? I did something very silly. Please, you don't-- No, I want to tell you. I broke your regimental plate. It was completely stupid of me. I just touched it somehow and it broke. I know. It was my own fault. You have every right to be angry. I don't mind if you are. I'm really not angry. I know I've been a terrible disappointment as a wife. None of this would be happening if I'd had a son. I will make it up to you somehow. I will find a way. I really will. Don't worry about anything, please. Just go to bed. Of course. I didn't mean to annoy you. I'm so sorry. No, you haven't. I'm not. Stop fiddling about, woman, and come and help me. What do you need? I need to get up and I need to get dressed. Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure. Do I look like someone who isn't sure? Let me help you. You're looking very good, if I may say so, sir. Thank you, George, I wish I felt the same way. I'm not looking forward to this. Don't worry, sir, you'll beat your record. You always do. FRANCES: Darling? Excuse me. What do you think? You look wonderful. Ew, kissing. Can I go to town with Auntie B? Thanks. Make sure your back in time for the lunch. I'm so happy. I'd almost forgotten how beautiful it is. What would you like to wear? The tweed, of course. It's the shoot today. You didn't take the pistol out, by any chance? Certainly not, why? Well, it's gone missing. One of the keepers must have borrowed it. Morning. -Good morning. -Thank you. Sir. Thank you. Oh, that's a little heavy. Well, it's your gun, Johnny. Yes, of course, I'll manage. Well, you can try mine, if you like, but you're always so rude about it. Why not? Then I'll try yours then. I always wanted to. That's much better. Sorry that. Come here, boy. Good dog. Come on, come. That's not like Captain. Captain, come on, come here. Something must have spooked him. Never mind, Zoe can look after us. I thought that was a brave thing you said last night. Thank you. What's the matter? Have they left you behind? Don't you worry. We'll soon have everything back to normal. What's that scratch on my rear bumper? It's being attended to, ma'am, I do assure you. It had better be. Now, let me be. I can manage this. Darling. What are you doing here? Is something the matter? What on earth are you wearing? Don't ask. I've had a terrible morning. You really are quite remarkable. Thank you so much. For what? Everything. Listen, I know how much you love me. So I want you to do something for me. Something very, very simple, but it'll make everything right for all of us. For you, for Piglet, and for me. That's what you want, isn't it? Of course. Good. Good. Come and sit down, please. I want you to write something for me. Will you do that? I want you to write to my darling, I love you so much. To my darling-- I know what to write. Where is everybody? They must have already gone to the West barn for lunch. We'd better get a move on. I just need to do something. I'll be quick. All right. I'll wait in the car. I'm told you've been shooting like a girl all morning. Is this true? No, no, he borrowed one of my guns instead of using his own. That's the problem. He's just too polite to admit it. I've never heard him accused of that before. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my family, I'd just like to say how pleased we are to see you all here today. I'm told we have a record kill this morning. Why aren't you at the head of the table? I thought Paul would do it better. Another minor record is that for the first time in living memory, I've managed a fractionally higher tally than my brother, Johnny. He'll make a fool of himself. Just you wait. And finally, if you would join me in raising a glass to my mother, who's here today, looking so radiant. Yo your very good health. Lady Spence. Lady Spence. I've spent too long away from this family. I don't seem to recognize anybody. Even you look a little odd, now I come to think of it. Mommy, I didn't expect to see you here. I'm not dead yet. What have you done with Francis? Oh, isn't she here yet? Excuse me, sorry. Darling, where's Mommy? You know. What do you mean? I saw you. Where? Just now with Mommy, giving her Granny's medicine. Why do you keep changing your clothes? Oh god. Where's Frances? Isn't she at lunch with you? No, she's not. Frances? Frances? Darling. Charlotte! Quickly! How much has she taken? Enough. Lift her. We need to get her blood pressure up. If she stays unconscious for too long she'll stop breathing. Why wasn't it kept locked up? You know perfectly well that it was. Now, leave it to me, and go and telephone for an ambulance. Now. Please, don't let her-- I won't. We'll just have to be patient, Mr. Spence. It will only take a moment. Just let them do their job. You heard what the doctor said. I need to speak with her. Later, you've done everything you can. How is she? Well, she's going to be all right. Johnny found her just in time, thank God. Do they know what happened? No, not really. How is everyone? Yes, gone, at last. I don't think anyone suspected anything. Do you know, I just saw something rather odd. What's that? That artist. Do you remember her? We met her together, the one from France? What about her? I just saw her in reception. She looked terrible. Like she'd been in a fight. Are you sure it was her? Yes, of course. She's gone now. That's what was so odd. I asked the nurse where you were, she got up and left. That's how I noticed her. Oh god. What? What's the matter? -Can I take your car? -But, of course. Stay with Frances. Please, don't leave her alone with anybody. I mean, anybody. Not even me. I'll be back as quick as I can. I told you what would happen if you came back. -Wait, please. -Why? Because I'm not Johnny. There are two of us. We-- he's someone I met and we swapped places because of the way we looked. And I know that sounds absurd. You are the ticklish one. Yes, I suppose I am. Although, that might be hard to prove at the moment. I knew you were different the moment you touched me. But I did not believe it was possible. I didn't mean to deceive you. Is that because of me? No, because of me. I'll survive. You know where he is. He just tried to kill my w-- he tried to kill Frances. I need to find him. He went to his foundry last night. Thank you. Who are you really? A teacher. Who are you really? A mother. I had to leave my child behind when I fled. I think it's time to go home, don't you? I'm not sure I know where home is anymore. Don't worry. You will. Mr. Standing. You'll have to excuse me, I'm just finishing a rather primitive supper. You look quite the country gentleman. So how did you find me? Bella. Of course, you have been busy, haven't you? Yes, I'm afraid I lost my temper with her, but you can hardly blame me. You've taken our little experiment further than I expected. Your effect on Frances was quite remarkable. I don't think I've ever been kissed like that before. I congratulate you. You certainly made everything much easier for me. What did you do to her. I didn't have to do anything, thanks to you. She's always been very persuadable, but, of course, you already know that. I can't blame you. I'd have done the same. In fact, I did. I assume you're here about the money. Don't worry, you'll get your share. Frances" father's a very rich man. I can afford to be generous. There is no money. She's not dead. Not possible, I gave her enough to kill a cow, appropriately enough. I want you to go away and leave her alone. Oh, so you want it all, do you ? That's a little greedy. But no more than I expected. You've become almost as good at being me as I am. I'm serious. Yes, so am I. Now, take off those clothes. We're going to have to change back. No. I mean it. I don't need you, I need my clothes. Now, take them off. So you're going to kill us both. Was that always your plan? God, no, do I look like an idiot. I never even thought you'd make it to the house, let alone into my bed. No, I had you bleating out you're unlikely story to the baffled country policeman, and being sent politely on your way. But I did get curious, so I rang the house after a couple of days. When Charlie answered and said I was out but would be back in an hour, I realized the walls had been breached, and I had the perfect opportunity. You're not the only one. This last week has been the most extraordinary of my life, and I love your family, every single one of them. You have no idea how lucky you are. Oh god. You are pathetically sentimental. My family's too selfish to love anyone but themselves. Believe me, I've lived long enough with them to know that. Now, would you hurry up? What will you do with me? Ashes to ashes and all that. There'll be no trace of you by morning. FRANCES: Hi. What happened? I've had such terrible dreams. You're safe. Have I disappointed you again? You've never disappointed me. You're the most extraordinary person I've ever met. And I'll never forget a moment I've spent with you. Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you. What's the matter? You're shaking. Don't worry about me, just rest. Rest and get strong. Sleep. You've changed, do you know that? Have I? I don't know. You seem harder to me, at least. You never loved me at all, did you? I don't think I did. So you have changed. You don't even pretend anymore. Paul wants to take me abroad. France, Italy, everywhere. He's suddenly full of ideas for the business. He thinks I can help him. I think that would be very good. Really? Yes. I've never traveled. I've never been anywhere with the war and everything. I'm terrible at languages. What use would I be to him? You'd be just what he needs. You looked so strong together today at the lunch. He really loves you, you know that. I'm still bloody furious with you, you know. I know. Stay with her. Of course. She's asleep. Where are you going? To see Mary Lou. I made a-- I made a promise. Frances will be all right. Yes, I know. I don't think I knew what it meant to have a brother until today. Thank you. How's Frances? Better. Sleeping. I wrote the note she left. She must have felt so alone. It made me think about what you said about Alice, having no one to turn to. You're right. When it mattered, we all failed her, including me. I've decided to accept your offer. You'll take over the foundry? Yes. I'm glad. There would be a condition. Anything. That you never set foot there again. Paul and I will be in charge. I completely agree. What will you do about finance? Well, come on, there has to be something here we can sell. She's asleep. Please, don't wake her. Eek, eek. Goodnight, Mr. Rabbit. She told me what she saw this afternoon. I said you were helping her mother. That's what she believes now. Thank you. But it wasn't you she saw, was it? What do you mean? I know Johnny better than anyone. He loved me in his way, but as he grew older, I faded like a photograph. I became invisible to him. But he wasn't to me. I saw everything he did, and then something changed. Child sensed it, said you smelt different. I didn't believe it at first. But this afternoon, when we found her on the bed, I saw your face. Then I was sure. I'm leaving. I came back because I made a promise I would tell Piglet first if I ever had to go away. Please, tell her one day that I tried to keep it. Is he coming back? No. Ever? No. Then why are you leaving? This isn't my house. It isn't my family. Isn't it? This Princess Elizabeth wasn't meant to be queen, any more than her father was born to be king. Sometimes, nature or fate take the decision. Perhaps it will be the making of us. [PING PONG BALLS BOUNCING] MARY LOU: 5, 6, 7, 8. FRANCES: Very good. Whoa. FRANCES: I'm so sorry. Are you all right? Need to be careful in your condition. I'm fine. Just a little out of breath, that's all. Come on, it's about to begin. Oh. George! Charlotte! Annie! Everyone! [MUSIC PLAYING]
