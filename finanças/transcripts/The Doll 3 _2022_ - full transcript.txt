Dad, are we picking up Tara? Yes, we are picking up your big sister. At her new workplace, she often works late. I see. -Please wait for a moment. -All right. What's wrong? We ran out of Bobby dolls, ma'am. I'm calling to check the storeroom. -Nobody is picking up. -I see. Rere! You scared me. Why didn't you pick up the phone? What are you doing? I was getting some boxes to restock the Bobby dolls. -Yes? -But after looking at it… Don't you think it's creepy? What do you mean? It's cute. Listen. I heard this about dolls from Mrs. Laras and Mr. Raynard. Who are they? The psychics who helped my cousin with some sort of doll problem. They said that dolls have a special bond with their owners. That is what makes the doll alive. That's how dolls get possessed. Possessed? Yes, possessed by spirits. But the worst thing to do is if we do it on purpose. Like calling a dead person to possess the doll. Whoever fills the doll with a spirit will never live the same life again. Their lives will end badly. Isn't that creepy, Tara? It is creepy. If only I believed in it. What? You're so silly for still believing in that stuff. Tara, I'm serious. That's what happened to my cousin. I'm serious, too. We've run out of Bobby dolls outside. Come take some out. -Come on. -Tara! Tara, wait for me! -Here. -The doll, sir. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Can I help you? Good afternoon. How can I help you? Hi, I'm looking for a gift for my girlfriend's little brother. I see. Okay. How old is he? Well… I think 16. Sixteen? Whose brother are you talking about? Wait, babe, how old is Gian? He's 12. I'm sorry. It's for Gian who is 12 years old. -Babe, I'm at work. -Sorry, I forgot. Are you going to pick up Gian later? -Yes. -Okay. I'm sorry I can't drive you. I have another meeting after this. It's okay. By the way, is there anything Gian wants from here? You don't have to do that. -Why not? -There's no need. Babe, what's that? It sells really well. That doll is called Bobby. It's quite advanced. It can move its head and arms, and it can walk too. You can even talk to it. -Really? -Yes. It's like an interactive doll. You can ask anything and it will answer. Isn't it cute? Very cute. Let's go over there. -You want to see it? -Yes, I do. -Okay, come on. -Let's go. Here. You can try it right here. -Let me turn it on. -Okay. Hi, I'm Bobby. I'm ready to be your friend. Hi, Bobby. It's so crowded here, right? Why is it so crowded? Because of me. He said it was because of him. -Can I ask him something? -Go ahead. Well, Bobby, have you eaten yet? Not yet. What do you want to eat? Meatballs. Is that all he can say? -Well… -"Not yet" and "meatballs"? It depends on what you ask him. Everything is programmed. What if I ask him a question that isn't programmed? I don't know. Just try it and ask. All right, let me try. Bobby. Can you try and guess my job? Am I in import and export? Don't laugh. Or do I work in security? Do I know you? Clever, right? He really is. It's so cool. Why don't I just get this for Gian? No, this is way too expensive. What? But will Gian like it? -Of course, he will. -All right then. He would love this. I'm getting it for him. I'm getting this for Gian. Okay? Bobby. You're going to be Gian's friend. Okay. HADIKA HOSPITAL Gian is getting better. He's able to control himself. But the trauma after the accident is still there. Even though it happened a year ago. Patients who suffer from trauma after accidents need lots of time to heal. Especially because Gian has a brain injury. The best thing we can do now is to keep his emotions stable. We cannot make him feel lonely. Whenever he feels like he's alone, he will remember that accident. And then he will be depressed. And subconsciously, he will try to harm himself, just like what has previously happened. You're the only family he has left. He really depends on you. He feels home and loved when he's with you. -Thank you, Doctor. -You're welcome. Gian. Let's go home. Okay. Gian, the bank took our house to cover Mom and Dad's loans, so now we're staying here. It's a facility I received from my office because now I work as a marketing manager. Here, try this. Are you full? Yes, I am. Okay, time to give you my surprise. -A surprise? -Yes. Do you want to see it? All right, go wait over there for a second. Hi, I'm Bobby! I'm ready to be your friend. Bobby! Hi, I'm Gian. Hi, I'm Bobby. Meet my sister. Her name is Tara. Nice to meet you. Right, Bobby. Look, I have a toy. Nice to meet you. Hello. ARYAN: BABE, DOES GIAN LIKE THE DOLL? He loves it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. By the way, you're coming to my office's New Year's Eve party, right? Of course. Should I pick you up? No, I'm carpooling with Rere tomorrow. -I'll see you there? -Okay then. Who were you talking to? My boyfriend. I've been wanting to tell you this. Are you going to leave me alone? No, sweetie. I have a New Year's Eve party tomorrow. Come with me, okay? I'll introduce you to my boyfriend. His name is Aryan. He's the one who got you Bobby. He's really nice. I'm sure you'll like him. Why do you have to date? Do you not love me anymore? What? Why would you say that? Of course, I still love you. Gian, ever since Mom and Dad passed away, you're the one I love the most in this world. There is no one else. You're my only brother. I love you so much, Gian. You must know that, okay? -Here! -Hi! Come on. -Looks fun. -So many people. Hey, Tara. Hey, Tara. -Do you know-- -Aryan? Just a second. Hey, babe. -Hi, Rere. -Hi, Aryan. Hi, Gian, how are you? Gian, this is Aryan. Say hello. Say thank you for the Bobby doll. Thanks. You're welcome. Do you like the doll? Gian, there's cake over there. Come with me? Tara, I'll watch Gian for a while. Will you be okay? Have fun. -Babe, come over here. -What? -What are you doing? -Just come with me. Where? -What is it? -Are we alone? What is it? Just tell me already. Tara. Yes? I've been carrying this around with me for a month. I've been waiting for the right moment to ask you, but I kept missing the timing. I know that this is not exactly the perfect romantic setting. But I feel like I have to do this before the year ends. Tara. You know how much I love you, right? I want you to be my wife. I… want us to grow old together. I have to tell Gian. He must be delighted. Let's go tell him. There's Rere. Rere. Where's Gian? -Gian? -Yes. He was right beside me. -Aryan, I'm going to find Gian. -Well… Tara! Gian? Gian! Where is he going? -Ten! -Ten! Gian? -Nine! -Nine! -Eight! -Eight! Gian? -Seven! -Seven! -Six! -Six! Gian! -Five! -Five! Gian! -Four! -Four! Gian? -Three! -Gian! -Two! -Gian! Gian! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! -Whose child fell? -Oh, my god. 2 MONTHS LATER Tara. I know how hard this is for you. But you're not alone. I want to go through this with you. I don't want us to grow apart like this. It's been two months, Tara. Please call me back, okay? I love you so much. Mikha says hi. She misses you too. I'll be waiting. SPIRITS CAN ACTUALLY MEET WITH A LIVING PERSON HOW TO TALK TO SPIRITS APPARENTLY, THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD CAN MEET EACH OTHER HOW TO SUMMON SPIRITS, A TUTORIAL MANY BELIEVE THAT A SHAMAN CAN SUMMON AND BRING SPIRITS Did you bring the medium? It's my brother's favorite doll. You understand that this is a serious matter. We're talking about summoning a spirit back to our world. It is not forever. I only perform this ritual for families who really need to say their last goodbyes. I understand. I just need to tell Gian a couple of things. I don't want him to leave this world thinking that no one cares about him. I want him to rest in peace. Very well then. I will begin the ritual. I am here as a bridge to invite Gian Galendra, son of Rahmat Galendra, at the request of his sister, Tara Anindita. Wake up, wake up Wake up, spirit I summon thee Your body and soul Have an unfinished business here Your brother is in this doll. In a couple of days, this doll will live as your brother. Take care of the doll. Just like how you would take care of your brother, okay? Remember. This is not forever. I'll be waiting for you here, two weeks from now, to return Gian to his world. Gian. Gian. If you really are in this doll, give me a sign. I miss you so much. -Ma'am, please come in. -Hi. -Is Aryan upstairs? -Yes, he is. Come in. Aryan. Tara. Babe, I've missed you so much. Me too. I was so surprised when you called to say you were coming. Wait, Mikha called me last night. She told me you're going to Bali. Well, I am. I'm packing right now. I'm seeing a potential investor. I'll be back tomorrow. Wait a second. Mikha called you? What did she say? She wanted me to be with her while you're away. She said that you said it was okay. Gosh, typical Mikha. I had no idea about this. I swear, she didn't say a word about this. Hey, but it's okay. What matters is that you're here now. You can stay here for as long as you like. I'll be happy if you do. All right, babe? Where's your ring? Oh, I have it. In my bag. I took it off when I was showering. I'll put it back on later. What are you drawing? Tara! Sweetheart. I've missed you a lot. I've missed you too. How are you? Doing well? Of course, healthy and strong! Bobby… Why do you have Bobby with you? Just to keep me company. He reminds me of my little brother. Be strong, Tara. I'm sure Gian is happy now up there. Thank you. Tara, let's play Monopoly. -It's my favorite game right now. -Sure. -Come on. -Okay. What a cute puppy. What's her name? Her name is Millie. -Millie? -Isn't she cute? She's so cute. Here is the board… Sweet dreams. Tara. Yes? My mother got really sick, and then she passed away. You remind me of my mother. She was so kind. I love you, Tara. I love you too, Mikha. Gian. Gian? Gian, this is Tara. I really want to meet you. Gian, please answer me. Gian. Gian, I really miss you. Gian. Tara. I miss you too. Why are you crying? Are you sad because I'm back? Is this… Is this really you? Yes. Gian… Tara. How are you doing? Where did you go after leaving this world? The afterlife. Did you see Mom and Dad? No. My place is different from theirs. Why so? I don't know. But for people who died the way I did, we went to a different place. Gian, please forgive me. I shouldn't have left you for even one second at the party. It's okay. What matters is that we're here together now. Yes. Where are we now? This is Aryan's house. You remember Aryan, don't you? Aryan proposed to me at the party. I said yes. But then you left. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know if I could move on and continue with the wedding plans. But you're here now. So-- You still want to marry Aryan? Only with your blessing. We will be a family, like back in the day. But… Please don't let anyone else know that you are in this Bobby doll. It's not easy for the human mind to process this. You understand, right? Besides, Aryan is out of town. When he comes home, I will explain everything to him gently, all right? Hello? So? So what? So when are we going to start planning our wedding? Well… We'll talk about it when you're back in Jakarta. All right then. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have avoided you. It's okay. I understand. Excuse me, miss? Why didn't you tell me you're coming here? Let me introduce myself. I'm Rere, the wedding organizer. Are you serious? Yes. Aryan called me last night. Gosh, he's so nice. He knows about my dream, and he's giving me an opportunity. He said no one knows Tara better than her best friend. What about your work? I resigned, of course. Tara, I know you're still sad over what happened to Gian. But I'm sure that if Gian were still here, he would want you to be happy. Aryan has been patiently waiting for you. Yes, he's been really kind. Aryan called me last night, but he didn't tell me to come right away. I just couldn't wait. It wouldn't hurt to find a wedding dress even if the date is still unknown, right? All right. Hi. Tara, can I come? Mikha, why are you carrying Bobby? Bobby was just sitting on the stairs, so I took him with me. Mikha, meet my friend, Rere. -Hi, I'm Mikha. -Hi, sweetie. Let's turn this doll around. So that it won't face me. I'm scared. Gosh. We have a couple of new designs that just came in. This is one of them. This dress. It's gorgeous. It is. All of this is imported from Paris. -Tara. -Yes? Can I play with Bobby over there? All right, but be careful, okay? What's the theme of the wedding? I can give you some references. Actually, we haven't thought about it. Mikha. Bobby? You can walk? I haven't pressed the on button yet. I can walk. What else can you do? Can you dance? Yes, I can. Can you play games? I bet the answer is, "Only with you," right? Hide and seek. For real? Now close your eyes. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Bobby? Ready or not, here I come. Bobby… Bobby. Where is it? Hey! This one is cute. Do you like this one? Not really. This part is a little… I think I prefer other designs. Bobby? Mikha? Oh, no. Mikha… Mikha! -Tara! -Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Your legs? It hurts. Tell me where it hurts. My head. -Oh, my god. -Let's get you to a hospital. -Bobby, Tara! -Don't worry, we'll take him. Come on, sweetie. I swear, Dad. Bobby can walk. That's how I played hide and seek with him. Mikha, sweetie, Bobby is a smart doll. It cannot do things that aren't programmed into it. It can only move its head and hands. But this Bobby is so cool. It's not like the ones my friends have. I've never seen one like this. Mikha, can I talk to him for a second? Babe, are you sure Mikha didn't hit her head? Why does she sound delusional? The doctor said everything is fine. -Are you sure? -Yes. Thank God, then. All right, I'm on my way home. Okay, take care. Tara. I'm not imagining things. I'm serious. I know. Let's get you to bed, okay? Come on. Be careful. Gian. What happened back there? I was playing with Mikha. She slipped on the stairs. I wanted to help her but it was too late. I'm sorry. I couldn't protect Mikha. I really want a younger sister like her. It's okay. But for now, please don't do things that Bobby can't do. Try to hold it in, okay? I'm going to cook now. Wait here, don't go anywhere else. Good evening, sir. Oh, my. You're cooking. What's for dinner? I wonder… It's pasta! Awesome. -Your favorite, isn't it? -Yes. I'm starving. It's not done yet. -Is it going to take a while? -I think so. All right, I'm going to wash up. Min? Min! Min! It's all done. Can you help me serve it on the table? Yes, ma'am. Min! -Go get Min. -Yes, ma'am. Aryan! Min! Sir! -Help him up. -Okay. Sir. -Get up, babe. -Just a second. Let's go. Aryan, you can walk, right? Gian. How did you end up in the bathroom? I told you to stay in the bedroom. I heard Aryan screaming. I wanted to help him, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. It's all right. Thank you for trying to help Aryan. Okay. By the way, when are you going to introduce me to Aryan and Mikha? Aryan is back home now. I can't wait. Tomorrow, okay? Okay. Okay then. I'm going to wash up. Mikha? Why aren't you at work? It's Saturday, sweetie. It's my day off. I brought a cake with me. It's delicious. Don't worry, it doesn't have any peanuts, so you won't get an allergic reaction. -Really? -Do you want it? -Of course, I do. -Should I get it now? -Sure. -Okay, be right back. Just leave Bobby with me. Okay. I'll talk to Mikha later. Here you go. Thanks. What's up with Tara? I don't know. All right, let's just play. I don't want to. Why are you like this? We're friends. We're not friends! Oh, you must be jealous. Because there are other dolls here, right? Look. We have a cat and a giraffe. The cat's name is Meow. And the giraffe's name is Jiffy. Why are you laughing like that? They're all inanimate objects. You are one too. You're also a doll. I am different! I'm alive! Bobby! Bobby, help me! Bobby! Bobby, help! Bobby! Bobby, no! Bobby! Bobby, don't! Bobby. Bobby, no! Mikha! -Don't! -Mikha! Mikha, sweetie, are you okay? My gosh, look at your hands. Why did you hurt Mikha? Come on, let's get you inside. Sari? You have a first aid kit, right? Mikha's hand is hurt. -Can you please dress her wounds? -Yes, ma'am. Gian! Gian! Gian! Stop, Gian! Hey! Gian, what are you doing? Gian! You don't love me anymore! Says who? I do love you! You love Mikha more than me! I hate her! I hate Aryan! I hate everyone that you love more than me! I don't want them to exist! Gian. You can never say that. It's not nice. I do love you. You're my only brother. Okay? Now wait here for a moment. Please, I beg you, just stay here. Stay in this room. Okay? Mr. Jaya! Mr. Jaya! Gian? Gosh, Ra. It should be fine, right? I mean… Gian is my little brother. I know he wouldn't do anything bad. When he was still alive, he liked to harm himself. But he wouldn't harm anybody else, Rere. Don't be too naive, Tara. Didn't you see what happened to Mikha? I've told you this before. Whoever puts a spirit into the doll will never live the same life again. What happened to Mikha at the boutique, and Aryan in the bathroom, those aren't coincidences. Do you know what Gian wished for during the last days of his life? He wanted love. He wanted attention. He wanted to feel safe. He wanted you, Tara. But when he came home, he found out you and Aryan were getting married. He feels unwanted. That is what made him mad. Someone who has died, especially by suicide, will never be the same once you summon them back into this world. They are already tainted by negative energy. That is why he has been causing harm. Where is the doll now? At home. Can you reach Mr. Jaya? -Not yet. -All right. Let's get Gian. We'll go to Mrs. Laras' and Mr. Raynard's house. Gian? -Aryan, where are you? -I've just arrived at the office. I went home to pick up a file. After this, I'm taking Mikha to the doctor to check her hands. Is Mikha okay? Did Bobby hurt her again? She's fine. Is the doll with you now? No. Tara. What is going on? Mikha told me about it when I got home. Just calm yourself down, okay? There must be a glitch in the system that's making the doll act weird. Dad! Aryan, what's happening? Calm down, sweetie. It's okay. -Hello? -Aryan? Help, the elevator just stopped. Aryan! POLICE SPECIAL TEAM VIP WARD -Thank you, officer. -You're welcome. -Thank you, officer. -Please excuse us. Aryan. What did they say? They're going to investigate it. It's so weird. The elevator line just snapped out of nowhere. It's unusual. What's wrong? Hey, what is it? Bobby did this to you. Aryan. The Bobby doll… is not like the other dolls. Gian is in that doll. I know it sounds crazy. But Gian is really here, Aryan. I saw a shaman. We called Gian's spirit and put him in the Bobby doll. I just wanted to say goodbye to him. It turns out he doesn't like the fact that I have you and Mikha who I love. That's why he's trying to harm you. He is not who he used to be. He is a different person now. What are you talking about? Why are you speaking nonsense in this kind of situation? Listen, Tara. I get it. I do. It's hard for you to let go of Gian. I understand. But not like this. You should go home. Get some rest. I'm going to stay here with Mikha. MR. JAYA Hello, Mr. Jaya? Why did you call? Please send Gian back. Please. It's supposed to be next week. What happened? He's harming the people I love. That means he made an ally with evil spirits. The Gian you know now is different. All right, bring the doll here. The doll is nowhere to be found. What? It can harm other people too. It seems like they want to stay in this world. We have to send them away from here. All right then. You have to come here now. You… You… Do not send me away! I want to be with my sister forever! Sir? Mr. Jaya? Tara? I've been calling you. So does Aryan. Aryan and Mikha are hurt. Did you find the doll? What's wrong, Tara? I just got back from Mr. Jaya's house. He's dead. And I found… I saw… I saw tiny footsteps there. Gian. I called Mrs. Laras and Mr. Raynard. They told me we need to take a piece of Bobby and a part of Gian's body. What for? To stop Gian, Tara. They told me we have to get those parts as soon as possible. Listen. You should go back to the hospital. Take care of Aryan and Mikha there. I'm sure Gian is going after them. Once you find the doll, get a piece of its body. Just buy some time until I get there. Where are you going now? I'm going to dig Gian's grave. Tara, please. Let me. It's for your own good. Tara, please. Hello, Mrs. Laras? Yes, I still have the one you gave me. And… Hello? Mrs. Laras? Does it hurt? VOICEMAIL Tara. Why are you looking at me like that? Whose blood is that? On your body. Are you afraid of me? You don't need to be afraid of me. I will not hurt you. Because I love you. But I will not let the people who took you from me get away. Nobody took me from you. Aryan and Mikha? They didn't do anything, Gian. If you think that I committed suicide just because you weren't there for me, you're wrong! I killed myself because you said yes to Aryan's proposal. I saw you look at Aryan differently. It's the kind of look that made me scared. That you will love somebody other than me. The look that will make you leave me. Like Mom and Dad. And now that I'm back, I can see clearly how much you love Aryan and Mikha. But you said you wanted a little sister like Mikha. I have never wanted a sister like Mikha. But if I didn't say that, back then, you would have sent me back to the afterlife, right? So you can live happily with them. That's why I pretended until I can get them away from you. Gian, please. Please don't hurt Aryan, Mikha, or anyone else. Please. You're saying that because you love them, right? Answer me! Gian, I will do anything. I beg you. Please don't hurt them. I promise, Gian. Prove that you only love me. Can you? First, throw your phone away. Tara. Did you sleep well? Yes. Can you wash my clothes? You should wash up too. Later, let's eat together. Eat up. Tara. Come sit with me. Watching TV together is nice. As long as it's just the two of us. Why are you crying? Do you miss Aryan and Mikha? No. Good. Tara? Tara, it's me, babe. Tara? Tara? Tara, are you there? Babe. Are you there? Tara? Tara? Tara, babe? He's gone. I'm sleepy. I want to take a nap. Can you come with me? Rere! Rere? Rere… YESTERDAY Tara! Tara! Tara! Tara, open the door! Babe, it's me. Tara! Tara, open the door! Why didn't you open the door? -Aryan. -What is it? -Gian is keeping me here. -What? The Bobby doll is possessed by Gian. I know you wouldn't believe me. I do believe you. I saw the CCTV footage. You're right. It's Bobby. He's doing all of this just to keep you for himself? -Is that right? -He's not like that, Aryan. The evil spirits have influenced him. Aryan, you have to leave. He's going to come back. -No, let's both go. -I can't, Aryan. -Don't be near him. He's dangerous. -He's my brother. He'd never-- He killed Rere, Tara! -What? -He killed Rere. Here's Rere's phone. Listen to her message. Tara, you need to do this alone. In my wardrobe, there's a bottle of holy water. Mrs. Laras said you should mix it with the parts of Gian's body and parts of Bobby. And then make Bobby drink it to stop Gian. Tara, she is no longer the brother you know. He's different. Rere! Babe, it's okay. Calm down, okay? What does she mean? Aryan. What are you doing? Nothing. I wasn’t doing anything. Where have you been? What if someone sees you? I've been checking the surroundings. In case somebody comes looking for you. That's why I have this with me. What a coincidence. I've been thinking, your hair is too long. Why don't I give it a cut? Like that one time you gave me a haircut? Yes. I want it. Come on. Make it look nice, will you? Okay. Let me tidy this up. Okay. Aryan! Aryan. Aryan! Gian, don't. I beg you. Gian, please don't hurt Aryan. Gian. Gian, please don't. Gian, please. I beg you, don't. You should only love me! I do, I only love you, but please… Please don't hurt Aryan. Gian… Gian, don't. Gian, please don't. Tara! Gian, you promised me you wouldn't hurt Aryan if I stayed with you. Why are you hurting me now? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. This is all… because of Aryan! Gian… Aryan, let's get out of here. Where are you going? Aryan! Aryan, come on. Aryan! Aryan! Aryan? Aryan! Aryan… Mikha is at home. Mikha… Take care of this, Tara. Sir, please call an ambulance right now. -Yes, miss. -I'm sorry, babe. MIN MIN Min? Where is Mikha? Who is she with? Mikha is in her bedroom with Sari. Min, go lock all the doors and windows, and don't let anyone or anything in, okay? Don't leave Mikha alone. Yes, ma'am. I understand. And please call the police right away. Rere… Rere. Rere. Rere… Rere. Rere, I'm so sorry. Oh, god. GIAN GALENDRA MARCH 11, 2009 - JANUARY 1, 2023 POLICE It seems pretty quiet here. Let's have a look inside. Hey! Officer T! Min! Why are you still here? Why aren't you with Mikha? I'm getting food for her. Why is that door open? What? I swear I have locked all the doors. Why is it broken? What's wrong? Sari! Min. No, don't! Don't! No! Sari? What's taking you so long? Sari? Come in. -Hi, Mikha. I brought you food. -Bobby? How did you… Bobby… Bobby! Bobby, no! Bobby, no! Bobby, don't! You can't go anywhere, can you? Bobby, enough! Bobby, stop! My head hurts. Sari! Min! Mikha? Mikha! Mikha! Mikha? -Tara! -Mikha! Mikha… Come on. Your leg… Tara, it's Bobby. Shush, sweetie. Tara… Come on, dear. How are you doing? 00:18:30.00 What the fuck? Fuck! Sari! Min! Get out, Mikha. Hurry. Mikha! -Tara! -Mikha, look out! Tara! Tara! Tara! Tara… My head hurts. Are you okay? What the heck? Why are you trying so hard to protect Mikha? Does she mean that much to you? You've crossed a line. I wouldn't have done so if you didn't love them. Do you know this is your fault? Yes. It is my fault. I shouldn't have summoned you here. You're no longer the Gian that I know. The little Gian that I used to carry. The one I used to pick up from school. The kind Gian. Sweet little Gian. That was my Gian. Not the evil Gian like you. I don't know what happened to you in the afterlife. How did you get influenced by the negative energy? But please, is my little Gian still there? Even just a little? Gian? Yes, Gian. My little Gian. My little Gian who I love. Gian. Gian, please. I beg you. Please. Please stop this, Gian. I love you, Gian. I really do love you, Gian. Please just stop, okay? If I hadn't seen that photo in Mikha's room, I probably would have listened to you. Mikha does not deserve to live with us. Gian, don't. Please. I beg you, Gian. Please forgive me. Bobby! No, Bobby! Bobby! Bobby, don't! -Gian! -Bobby, don't! No! Bobby, don't! Bobby! Bobby, no! Tara… It's okay, Mikha. I'll see you at the hospital, okay? Good evening, Mrs. Laras. I'm Tara. Rere's friend. Can I meet you in person? -Mrs. Laras? -Yes? I'm Tara. -Welcome. -Please come in. Tara. If you want to say something to Gian, this is the time. After I say the prayers, he won't be able to hear you again. This is your last chance. Gian. Do you remember? When you were a little boy, I took you to the beach one day and we played in the sand all day. We built this really huge sandcastle. I want… I want you to remember just the beautiful memories. Not the bad ones. You're always beautiful to me. Even if you were bad, it was all my fault. Not yours. You don't have to feel sorry. You don't have to regret everything that has happened either. Just remember the beautiful memory, okay, Gian? It's safe now. The doll is paralyzed. But it does not mean that it's over. What you have done, making it drink the holy water that was already mixed with elements of this world, will not make him leave. It will instead lock him. Lock? You mean he cannot go back to the afterlife? Correct. He will remain in that doll. But don't you worry. He won't be able to do a thing. It is just temporary. If you can let him go, he will leave. But if your heart still wants him around, he will stay. The more you miss him, the more he wants to be with you. And eventually, he will come back to life. What makes it so hard for you to let Gian go? He's the only family I have left. I have lost too many people. My father. My mother. I just can't… Letting go of the people that we love is not an easy thing. But not letting them go does not only make it hard for us, but it also makes it hard for them. Living without the people we love and who love us is not easy. But sometimes we don’t have a choice. Pray for him. Ask for forgiveness from God for his mistakes. Do not wish for him to come back. Instead, let him go. That way, he won't have a reason to come back. Eventually, he will let go too and accept his fate. Hey. The nurse told me you came here last night. I was asleep. What's wrong? What is this? That's the car that hit my parents' car. I haven't called Mr. Prasetyo yet. The lawyer of the man who hit my parents. I just wanted to make sure. You weren't the one who… Back then… Mikha ate a cake with peanuts in it. Mikha, hang in there. We're almost at the hospital. Just hang in there, sweetie. Almost there. Mikha! Are you all right? She almost died, Tara. We're almost there, sweetie. Just a little bit more. Are you okay? Wait here, sweetie. Mom… Mom. I wanted to be responsible. I turned myself in to the police. That day, the court ruled that it was an accident and that I had to pay for the damages. The court finds Mr. Aryan not guilty. What is this? It's from my client. I already received the payment. I am aware. But my client wishes to give you more than what the court has ruled. Sir, I just want to meet him. I want to know who he is. I want to talk to him in private. My client's identity is kept confidential. You should accept this. You need it for your brother's treatment. Yes, I know. My lawyer took care of everything for me. I know I'm a coward, Tara. I'm sorry that I refused to meet you. I was too scared to see you. I'm a coward. Because I know I'm wrong. I accidentally killed your parents and hurt Gian. I could only watch over you and Gian in secret. I wanted to know how he was doing. Excuse me? I'm sorry, can I help you? -Do you know Gian? -Oh, no. I was just… looking for a friend. I got the wrong room. Sorry. I didn't see it coming. From the day we met, we ended up getting close. I fell in love, Tara. Honestly, I've been meaning to tell you, but I just couldn't. And just so you know, I even tried avoiding you, but I couldn't do that either. Eventually, I thought that I could take care of you and Gian. That's why I did everything I could to make sure you and Gian were comfortable. Everything. I called my friend who owns Toyz Land. I took care of everything you needed without you knowing. The position of a manager, the apartment, the car, the pay, all of it. I took care of everything to make sure you and Gian were comfortable. Which is why I also wanted to marry you. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Please forgive me. When we started dating, I started to have a fear of losing something else. I was afraid… that you would leave me once you find out about this. I've lost someone I loved once. I didn't want it to happen again. I know exactly how it feels to lose someone you love. I'm also afraid of losing people again. I hate it. I don't want to feel it again. What can I do to make you forgive me? Tara, please. Tell me. Please. I… I forgive you, Aryan. I forgive you. But if we continue this… That means I will see your face every day. Please don't leave me. And your face will remind me of the death of my parents. Tara, please. I can't do this, Aryan. Don't. Please, don't. No… Bye, Aryan. Tara… Tara. Mikha, I'm sorry. I have to leave. We have to be apart to move on with life. You will be okay. I will be okay, too. I will try to rebuild my life. No matter how hard it may be. Let's not look back at the past. Don't long for it either. Leave it be. So we can start anew.
