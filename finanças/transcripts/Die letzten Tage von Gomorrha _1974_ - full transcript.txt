The Last Days of Gomorrha Hello? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Sorry, I can't hear you. This thing's not working. I don't want an apparat. We'll wait here 'til you pay. It's expensive. - What's in the box? - I don't know! Get out! Hey, do we also get an apparat? Get out! If it's ripped off, we're in for it. Life sentence. Apparat users want to know: "Who is Noward News?". They connect with him daily. Noward News's response: "Step inside the apparat and you are me." Representitaves of Noward News's competitor, Everywhere Evans, report their company stocks have fallen to zero as of yesterday. I don't want an apparat. Sign here. Sure. I don't understand all this. My boyfriend... I can't really afford it. You're not buying. You're renting. You can't buy it. It's too expensive. - No. - I don't want to try... - Come on. Step inside. μάτια... Eyes. Αυτιά... Ears. Ox-y-gen... You die without Ox-y-gen. Lovely knees. Smooth skin. Get off of me! Ehh.. you're disgusting! It's... been a long time since I've been with a woman. You're scared of your boyfriend, but don't be afraid of us.. I'm worried about the money. I don't have enough to make the payments. Don't worry. You don't have to pay. Make it quick. Stop! Stop! Kalle? It's here. What? The apparat. It's all good. Have you been inside before? It's fantastic, isn't it? You know? I imagine it's like... the movies or... or television, only even better. And it's not like you're just surrounded by moving pictures, you're really somewhere else. And you feel it too, you smell it, it's all around you. Talk to me, Kalle. Say something! I am extremely pleased to see you, General. I see your apparat arrived before mine. Seems like you're doing pretty well between me... - and your other customers. - My boyfriend. It's my boyfriend's. Is he inside? Yeah, he's inside Must be incredible. Can he hear us? No, he can't hear anything. I'm not relaxed with your boyfriend here. It's a turn off. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Anyways, it's my last visit. I'm getting my apparat soon. Then I won't need you anymore. And this "business" doesn't bother him? No, he doesn't care. All right then... Here's your things. My heart. -I'm ready. - Okay then. That's wrong. You got it all wrong. Spread your legs more. The right one further out! The left one in! Right! Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful. - That's... That's lovely. - Yeah? No. It's still not right. I'm always in pursuit of perfection. But there's only one perfection -- death... ...or the purest invention. You see -- That's why an apparat is superior to you. I don't understand. You were pretty good, my child. Come closer to me. Everything is wrong. You moved to fast. I don't know. I'm not turned on. I'm not feeling it. And now you have to tell me about what you did at Fort David. Before the Africans took it. We never got it right. We never really won! But victory is always possible inside the apparat. Now! Get undressed! Now! You pigs! Give me my money back! Shut up! Leave me alone or I'll call the cops! I am the cops. Do you have a permit? Okay. Time to renew, baby. Such a sweet color. Open up! Kalle, I... They were trying to break in! Two times now and I... I was afraid. Kalle... You... They want me to work for them. But I want to stay with you, Kalle. I belong to you. If you're mine, you can't go fucking up my life. But I'm not making enough money. The apparat is too expensive. And you're always inside... It's not like I am cheating on you. No... It's not like you're cheating on me. You have to go to the service center now and get a repairman here. Do it for me. -Can you do that for me? - But I am real... more than just "a thing". We could do so many things together. Once you've been inside... Nothing seems to make sense here anymore. Okay, I'll go. I'll get it fixed for you. I'm from district 236, block 1186 B. I cut the network cable. The apparat was already installed. It's too expensive. So, you want us to uninstall the apparat? Yes -- I mean, no. So, you want us to reconnect the device? It's going to be expensive, the service costs. All that money wasted. I want to speak with the designer. What good would that do you? To know if you're truly fullfilled when you're "inside". If you're complete then... Excuse me... I have other customers. I'm interested in a custom model. I have very specific needs... ...and very high standards. Higher than other people... I've struggled my whole life. After everything I've been through, I think I deserve this... You should really think before you get that "thing" installed in your room. Always helping other people over the years. Now it's my turn. I want to be a piano virtuouso. I have pianist's hands -- in the apparat maybe I can have four hands. I also have other fantasies, for example... - Right... - I want to be an architect who builds dams. Maybe during the time of Ramses II. This is all possible with the apparat, right? I want to speak to the designer. I'm not going anywhere until I talk with him. Can I have the name of the designer, please. Oh, it's a team. But there is a director. Please, who? Plu-to-ni-us... Dr. Plutonius. Thank you. He is not available. I understand. Thank you. Ciao. There, you have your name. He is unavailable to the public. Now, please. This model isn't in production yet, but it's available for pre-order. Thank you. Plutonius... Hello. So we're not talking anymore? Sometimes I trust you... Sometimes I don't. Fifty-three. I'm meeting the designer of the apparat. What? No. You should come with us. Mary? Who is "us"? "The department stores of Sodoms are clos... closing down. With Gomorrah Incorporated's hostile takeover of our company we are being systematically laid-off." No one will come. They're all sitting inside their apparats. At least a hundred thousand of us will be there. You're dreaming. Yes. But secession is also a dream. Which dares to change everything, in these times when things are changing too quickly. Secession is the dream of reactionaries. Aren't you afraid? Yes! If I don't have any customers tonight, you can sleep over. Come with us. Identification. Invalid! A little more sweat on the faces, otherwise it doesn't look real. And please, a little more gray in the suits. I've said that a hundred times. Make up your mind, already. They look good enough to me. And now Mr. Bürzelmann, please. This apparat... The millionth... born from the foundries of Gomorrah Incorporated symbolizes a pennacle in the ingeniuty and greatness of the human spirit, an evolution which has been centuries in the making. Can you do it with a litte more feeling, Mr. Bürzelmann Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Plutonius. Get out. Out! Stop her! Hey! Linguistically that sounded pretty bad. Could you give us a better performance? This apparat... The millionth. born from the foundaries of Gomorrah Incorporated... embodies the pennacle... I'm looking for Dr. Plutonius. A perfection of the eternal dream of mankind. The dream to erase all anthropological and historical limitations. An ultimate emancipation... Your future... I'm looking for Dr. Plutonius. He's there. Dr. Plutonius? You want to speak with me? Come with me. This apparat... the millionth... born from the foundaries of Gomorrah Incorporated symbolizes a high point in the evolution of our great civilization. For us, it personifies the triumphant human spirit, and marks our greatness in world history. With this, mankind's dream to control his destiny is at last realized. We are finally, freed from all bonds which history and anthropology has bestowed upon us. Mankind is now the master of both his past, and his future. And you are the inventor? No. We are a team. Be careful, that's a laser. If you make direct eye contact, it's dangerous. Please don't touch it. Your hands. It's very sensitive. My hands are clean. Look closely -- the sweat. Sorry. What is that? That's an optical plate with a hologram. Be careful, if it comes in contact... With something organic, it will short circuit. We were developing components throughout the sixties and seventies which eventually evolved into this holographic projector. Initially it could only clone one dimensional images. Back then, the holograms at were mostly static... simple photographic plates Our goal was to make these holograms move. Laser light waves differ from conventional light waves. They have the capacity to imitate in-phase and quantum particles. Yes, but what about the sensations? Sensations? It also creates a feeling. That's caused by electrical currents in the brain. They're simply responding to a simulated stimulus. Our initial theory originated in the 1950s, during the beginning of the Cold war. But it can project your wishes. It's like... A thermostat which heats up when a room is cold. My thermostat is broken. See, this invention was only made possible with the increase of computer processing speed. Why did you do that? Now it's broken. How can I explain this to my superiors? I'm responsible for the lab. Stop! Hey... Come out, Kalle. Leave me alone then. Damn. Shit! My papers! It's all there. Is this my blood? Strange... Where's my bag? It's here. Thanks, darling. Names... Life goes by so fast. Come... It's... It's so cold. Tell me who shot you. What? What d'you say? Who was it? Soldiers... We were... ...unarmed. They just... ...fired at us. There were... ...so many there. You can't imagine. Oh Lilith, you have to get out. You can't stay here. I have a customer in a half an hour. Get it? You can't stay. You understand? I'm kicking you out. I've had enough of this, really. And I need the money. You can't be here when I have a customer. Mary? Miss Mary! You? I... I was planning to pay for that thing I broke, but right now I don't have any money. Do you understand? Not one cent. I can't. Really. If... If I could... I... This woman. She's wounded. She can't stay here. There's rats running around everywhere with this garbage. Blood. I have to wash my hands. Why are you here? Do you know the girl? Yes. We've known each other awhile. I have to get her out of her. I have a customer coming. He can't stand the sight of blood -- I mean real blood. He was a General, do you understand? Yes. Naturally. Is that natural? She needs a doctor. She has to go to a hospital. If you pay for it. I don't know her. I can't pay for everyone. The BX8. The model from last year. The millionth just came off the assembly line. When you... When you were there. Lilith! Lilith! You could use the money for the apparat to pay. I mean. This is more important. Your... ...Friend. She's gonna' die anyways. The number isn't working anymore. Who is that? He is from Gommorah Incorporated. What? He's one of them! Get him... get him out of here now! What are you doing here? Yeah, it's... About an apparat. This one here. I developed it together with my team. Your friend visited my lab... And we just found out about some negative side-effects. I wanted to examine it. I was thinking... If there's room for any improvements. Improvements? As if you could improve that "thing". She worked at Sodom's department store. She was laid off. No one buys anything anymore since the apparat came. You know that yourself. Once you go inside an apparat you don't come back out. My customers don't come anymore either. First break it, then buy it. "They" don't care what happens to the people. But... It's not over. I shouldn't be here. You can sleep with me if you want. Otherwise I can't pay you for that thing I broke. Can you tell me if it's intuitive? Sorry. Intuitive? I could tell you a lotta' shit. Kalle! How long has he been inside? How has your relationship changed? Do you know if his perception of sight and sound has changed? Please go if you don't want me. No. Not this way. Then get the fuck out of here! Did you fire your weapon? Today on these people? I've never fired at anyone. It was my first time. And why didn't stand down? They were people. Yes, I know. I haven't stopped thinking about it. It's driving me crazy. Then surrender your firearm. I followed my training. Go! Stand up! Tie her hands! Kalle! Kalle! So, sweetheart! We're looking for a friend of yours! There! She's dead! Get away! Leave me alone! So these are the recordings of yesterday, taken for security measures. And where is she then, your "casuality"? She's not in this group. So then where is she? She's also not here. No. The photos of the suspects, please. That's her. She was... Who is responsible for this? Leave me alone! Here! A citizen was shot and killed. I was there myself when she died. It was horrible. Are you in contact with this woman's friend? I don't condone what these people may have done. But in my opinion, we've made a huge mistake. You want to say that I am responible? Don't you think I also suffer when I see this kind of thing? I loathe senseless brutality like this. I also want to say that, Noward News, whom I represent, disapproves as well. So... How can we demoralize these separatists? There's a simple solution. Reduce the production costs of the apparat. Noward News wants the people's apparat. In every home... Affordable for every Gommorahn. Let's talk... Dr. Plutonius, are things proceeding as planned? - Yes. It's... - I mean... - Are you close to completing the project? - I'm currently working on it. During the demonstration parts of my laboratory were damaged by a woman. She had nothing to do with the demonstration. I'm following up on the matter. I think we should reconsider the concept of the apparat. The apparat should not interact with our sensations -- they belong to us. Who is "us"? My team and I. You used the word responsible. Well... I feel a responsibility. Because there are defects, that ... my team could not have predicted, We must correct these first. With the acquisition of Sodom's, Gomorrah Incorporated will be the sole company here. I mean with great power... Comes great responsibility. You said it yourself. We can not allow the public access to the apparat... In doing so, we would be justifying the separatists' cause. We need to redesign it. I thought after the latest model, no further technical advances were possible. The people want the apparat. And so they will have it. Agreed. Agreed. Even at the risk... that we ourselves, my gentlemen... may one day be the only ones left here. I mean Noward News -- whom I represent... The people have the right to choose. No one forces them... to use the apparat. Let's go! We're finished! Here, it's yours! Kalle... Don't go back in, Kalle. Don't go back inside. I'll make you a coffee. I can't take it "up here". Don't go inside, Kalle! Don't go inside! Please, Kalle. Please... I'm questioning more than just the apparat here. But, my dear Dr. plutonius You are here in your capacity as ... say, creator of the apparat. And we are here as representatives of the company that manufactures it. We represent the consumers, their needs, and the workers... They manufacture the apparat und make a living from it. Yes. That's logical. I understand, but... For example, our workers: What should they manufacture in their factories? I mean our factories. I mean the factories of Noward News. What should they produce instead of apparats? After all, the factories are built for your apparat. I have to... think about it. Our Dr. Caligari... I used to be a cinephile, before I came to Gomorrah Incorporated. I came here for our genius. Our unparalleled genius. Yes but about the... ...shooting. We haven't discussed it. My dear Dr. Plutonius, am I deaf? Am I blind? We've been talking about it for some time. Much more time than I can afford to give you. Dear, Dr. Plutonius. What still interests me -- this young lady you were talking about. What was she "like"? I can give you her address. Kalle. I love you. I'll come to you. Hello? Not bad. I swear I didn't know the woman. Really! I recommend that we integrate the separatists by giving them positions here. Yes, we integrate them. Ah, Dr. Plutonius. Good day, my dear Dr. Plutonius. We took a look at your foster-child. She's not here because of the incident in the lab? No, she's considered to be a conspirator, in my opinion. We want to integrate her. Do you understand, Dr. Plutonius? You could release for testing the new program. For the aparat program. She's a lovely girl. Talk to her. Dear, Dr. Plutonius. Please. Stand-by please. Everything is automated here, Plutonius. You have to speak the code number into the microphone. Which code number? Where did I put the code number? - I lost it... - My God, Bürzelmann, it's always something. Well, that's the terrible thing about automation, we're all the same to it. Here... Here it is. 16 88 9 dash 63 visitor permission 24 Berta dash 217, prisoner 1 two... 8 4 3 9 Anton Paula. Enter. Ah, you. You don't believe me, Miss Mary, but I am your friend. Be careful. The chocolate. Watch out. Your dress. You're not here because of me. Not because of the lab. I know that. I took this to heart. What happened with you... and your girlfriend. I'm going to redesign the apparat. How? I don't know yet. I'm working on it. You have no idea about the process of redesigning such a complicated device... the required logistics and planning. But the key is in the programming. ...also written by my team. The device grants you your every wish. But, Miss Mary... The people themselves don't even know what to wish for. They need a suggestion first -- created from an algorithm. The company directors want to hire you to test this new program. If you want to, Miss Mary. I don't believe it. I give you my word. Do you have a mirror? We'd be working together. At least in the same house. And you think I can handle these tests? Visitor of the prisoner 1-2-3-4-8-9, Anton Paula, we ask you to please conclude your meeting. We wish you a pleasant journey home. I'm going to improve the apparat... and you'll perfect the program. Sorry, I'm more beautiful when I'm made up. You have to be able to sell yourself. Wandy Wasp couldn't sell herself. If you want to be successful, you have to be able to sell yourself. Do you think you can sell yourself? They gave a course in the warehouse, where they taught people to sell themselves. Were you there, by chance? Please come to the studio. Please come to the studio. Please come to the studio. Undress. Look at the camera. Teeth. Hair. Emotions. Fear. Hate. Malice. Love. Go to the control room, please. 90-58-90. Please go to the control room. Please hurry, 90-58-90. Please hurry. We're very curious. That would be the people's apparat. The apparat will cost much less to produce. Buyers can also pay in installments. And now the... so called "defect"... is corrected? We designed an automatic shut-off mechanism... After a given amount of time, the safety circuit will generate negative emotions which will intensify the users desire to leave the machine and uh... experience "real-life" again. And you're not afraid that the users, will start to want "real-life", as you so beautifully put it, to give them… the same happiness which only the apparat can induce. Yes... but that would... That would probably mean the decline of Gomorrah Incorporated, wouldn't you say? - Isn't that so? - And then... If that's what you want, Dr. Plutonius. Our demise? And yours? Is that what you want? Want I want... is that the defects of the previous design are eliminated. Not only should the apparat be affordable, it should also be non-addictive. When you designed the apparat, you were quite confident. You claimed it was a benign device which would cure anxiety. You delivered the proto-type and sent it into production. - and now you're not so certain anymore. - Yes, I'm sure it can! However, I am more certain that the BX8 is lethal. I can't sleep at night knowing... that the BX8 is still on the market with no guarantee that the... It's seems to me like the previous work you've done for us was below professional standards. Back then it wasn't so obvious. And now it seems obvious? Yes. Today you're certain of yourself? You seem unsure to me. In either case, consider the consequences for Gomorrah. The earlier model, the BX8 -- which has no safety circuit... every user had the right... to decide themselves on the duration of their stay inside. Except in certain cases when perhaps it was just too much for the user. Well you know, that's just a small unpleasant side effect. But, we also have to remember, that Gomorrah Incorparated, will now be the only company in Gomorrah. After the many and tiring struggles against Sodom's, soon Gomorrah Incorporated alone will have to feed each and every Gomorrahn, whom, due to automation, will have all become obsolete. Yes, a useless population of mouths to feed for the... Well... It's really not the worst thing. We simply cannot ensure the survival of everyone. On the other hand, if we give the public the apparats with your "safety circuit". Then we would be relocating their fantasy lives from the wish factory, and transferring them back to the regular factory. Or in your words, "reality", where their wishes cannot be granted. Chaos would follow shortly thereafter. Think about what the people want so see? Murder. Homicide. Rape. I tell you, they'd come and slaughter us. They want nothing more than to take our place. But with their innate inferiority, they couldn't possibly be capable of overseeing such a complex system. They could never keep Gomorrah under control. I'm the make-up in pers-on, that is the purest scorn, and if and when the splendor crashes with a roar, I know I've been forev-er Roaring with laughter. Hello. Hello? We're simply too different. It's a pity, that you have to be leaving us... Dr. Plutonius. But it's naturally a question of your conscience. - Once more please. - Coherent. On point. Yes... Very coherent. Please once more. No, not again. What is it Miss Mary. What's wrong? She's just walking out. My gentlemen, all your efforts to persuade me are in vain. I cannot and will not test this program anymore. - I'm going to Noward News myself. - To Noward News? We'll take you to Noward News. But he hasn't received anyone for years. He will receive Miss Mary. Please. Did you find Noward News? He is dead. Frozen? That means... We've been working for a dead man. You shouldn't look at it that way, Miss Mary. We work for ourselves. Who knows where would be without him. We need to stick togther now. We admit, we've made a few mistakes. Miss Mary! Miss Mary! Miss Mary. I shouldn't give away your little secret, huh? I'll kill you! You traitors! You've done such good work for Noward News, as have we, Miss Mary. Think about it, please. We wanted to let you know that. I don't want to work on this program. We also don't want it, dear Miss Mary. - Ah, stop it with your "dear Miss Mary". - But the public wants to know you as that persona. The public's taste is always changing. Maybe in the last minute they'll need a new program. You have no choice but to stay, and help us, Miss Mary. That's the wrong flag! Yes, that's the right one. Another flag, please. No. That's also wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Oh, I have no idea anymore. Charming, charming, this program. Hopefully we'll use it. You can't have everyone killed. Don't watch it. What's wrong now? Can't we continue? Maybe this program is a mistake. Maybe it stirs things up even more. It's a reenactment of the other day. Stay in your apparats! Stay in your homes! Don't panic. Why are they leaving their apparats? Until know everything was proceeding as planned. A little more attitude, Bürzelmann. Think of Louise the VI. He died with dignity, that's the least that could be said of him. You up there! At least talk to me! Are you taking a trip, Dr. Plutonius? I'm leaving Gomorrah. I can't stay here anymore. I'm going to a desert island. With palm trees. And... A white beach. Miss Mary? I... I don't want to go alone. Do you want to join me? As my girlfriend? Palm trees... A white beach? You don't belong here anymore. Know with the street filled with angry mobs. - It's dangerous for people like... - There! Come. Come. The plane leaves in an hour. Sit down here! What were up to there? Did you start the fire? She just stood there, watching it burn. Apparats, nothing but apparats. Do you know her? And the men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing. To kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you. Will not the Judge of all the earth do right? You will not judge like that." The Lord spoke: "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” What's going on with her? Inside the apparat I was you. I was you. So young and so beautiful. But I was too old. I knew that I could not be you. I have a very different life. You are not me. My life is not your life. I am not young. I am not beautiful. But I am I. And I will not let anyone take my life away. Not in the long run. That means... She was in the apparat and willingly stopped using it. That means not everyone is trapped inside until they die. You've seen your own face... and you're own life. And you came here... And burned down all the apparats. I told you, she's a little coo-coo. The studios are in that direction. Maybe it's better if we stay here. The people could use our help. Especially yours. I've made too many mistakes. I'm scared. I'm scared too. You should pack, Miss Mary. We don't have much time. Where's your things? You've got to help me. I don't what know what you want to take with you. Forget about the apparat! You're already telling me what to do, yeah? I don't understand. Kalle. I want to know if he's dead or not. Earlier I thought I saw him down there demonstrating. But then I thought, that's impossible. That's the BX8. No one comes back "out". But he did come out! He's down there on the street! - I know it! - Mary! You have the chance to start a new life now. Mary, look at me. There are people who've come back out. We are stronger than you think. We won't let ourselves be enslaved forever. He came out! I know it! Kalle! You! Please! Take me with you! Mary? Is Gomorrah still broadcasting? Subtitles by Andy und seinen deutschen Kumpels.
