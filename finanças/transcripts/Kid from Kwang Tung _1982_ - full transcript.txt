"Mingde School." Good morning, sir. Today we'll continue studying Tang Poems. Please recite the one we learnt yesterday first. Place the books in the drawers now. What happened? What's with the screaming? Show me your hand. The teacher asked you to show your hand, not place it underneath. What are you laughing at? Do we have lots of rats in the classroom? Why did you bring a mouse trap in? Yes, sir. We've seen lots of rats lately, right? Yes. That's why I brought the mouse trap... I mean... to trap them. All you know is play! Stand up. Yes, sir. Recite yesterday's poem. Farewell to Uncle Yun at Xie Tiao Pavilion. The whole poem? Yes. You deserve it! What left me yesterday can be retained no more, what worries me today are the times I feel sore for. For miles & miles the wild geese fly in autumn winds... Let's follow them with eyes and drink in towers high. Your writing's quite compelling, like ancient poets, like that of ancient poets... What are you doing? You recite "The Song of War Chariots" next. Continue. Yes, sir. While mine is in Xie's direct and easy style. Both of us have ambitions high; We'd bring the moon down from the sky. Cut running water with a sword, it will faster flow; Drink wine to drown your sorrow, it will heavier grow. Life is full of despair, let's sail away with our hair down. Not bad, sit down. He Jiayu, it's your turn. The war-chariots rattle, the war-horses whinny. Each one of you has a bow and a quiver at his belt. Father, mother, son, wife, stare at you going, Till dust shall have buried the bridge beyond Changan. What are you doing? Put your hands down. They run with you, crying, they tug at your sleeves, And the sound of their sorrow goes up to the clouds; And every time a bystander asks you a question, asks you a question... Ask me? Then I ask whom? Asks you a question... He Jiayu. Keep going. Asks you a question... asks you a question... Alright... here's a hint. You can only say to him that you have to go. Right... You can only say to him that you have to go. He Jiayu, have you forgotten the rest? Of course not! You can only say to him that you have to go. That you have to go... Whose is this? Sir, it belongs to Wu Dezhi. Stand up. A mouse trap, and now a frog cage! This is a school! What kind of behaviour is this? Yes, sir. But He Jiayu told me to bring them. I've nothing to do with it. Both of you, come out here. School is over for the day. Yes! School's over. Fatty, wait. What is it, loser? Don't be so smug. Just because I'm nice, that doesn't mean I could be messed with. You know, I've many tricks handed down from ancestors. What? Tricks handed down from ancestors? If you don't believe me, how about a challenge? Fine! You want to fight? No. You two are real trouble! Brother Liyi, our base in the north has been destroyed by Luo Yihu. Chief Chen died a martyr. I heard that Mrs. Chen and her daughter have travelled to the south, but I don't know their whereabouts. We must go find out. It's strange. How come that. He Jiayu isn't here yet? I'm sure he's afraid that he'll be outnumbered. Right, Debao? I wonder what their secret weapon is. Don't worry. Get ready. Ready! He Jiayu, I kept thinking what secret weapon could you have, you're dressed as a chicken! What do you know? The golden cock stands proud and sturdy. Everyone knows that the chicken preys on the centipede. That's why the centipede will be pecked to death. That's funny! Our centipede is longer than a cobra. That's right! I wonder if a sick chicken is up for the challenge. Enough with the crap. Have you brought the stuff? I've been waiting for you. So, as we said. Whoever wins the fight, and is the first to grab the signboard, that's the winner. Alright! Hang them up! Go! So many feet! Now you know! You'll soon be begging. Come on, lads! Go, lads! Peck you to death! Head butt! Bump. Chicken shit! Cross the bridge. "Longlife Martial Arts School." Go lads! - Master He. - Master Wu. Hello. - Master He. - Master Wu. Move over please. I'll take care of you later, kid. Where's my signboard? Here, dad. Really? Yes. You are useless! Simply no point in racing with a third grade school with a signboard made by rotten wood. At least you didn't let me down. Hurry and show our signboard to the villagers. Dad, this... Go on! Trouble. Move over! "Longlife Martial..." That's it!! Dad. I'm here, but the signboard's gone! Dad, we still have three characters. Jiayu, where's ours? Ours? All four characters are here. Please... you shouldn't overestimate yourselves. Even ours is made from rotten wood; But no matter what, we're still better than your so-called first grade one. Jiayu. What is it, uncle? Show ours! Uncle, that... Skill Ma... Skill Ma... Master He, since when you've opened up a brand new martial arts school? Not bad! You can save a piece of rotten wood! What do you mean? Below par. You brat! It must be you who ruined my signboard. I'm doing this because of your father. I'd forgive you if you send me a brand new one. Or else... What? Then I wouldn't care who your father is. Who needs you to do me a favour? You... what do you want? Don't forget. For generations, your family has lost to mine. Your great grandfather, your ancestors... each generation, and now... What about now? Just think it over. You tricked me! Very well! You won't have any descendents! Uncle, beat him! You don't need to worry about your generation, just beat him! Go on! Dad! Don't worry about me. You two are not kids! If you continue, you will be a laughing stock! What about our signboard then? It's just about your reputation. It's my unlucky day! I'll give you a new signboard. What do you think? Since that you... If you want to do that, I don't mind; But I can't be sure of what they'd think. It's fine as long as I don't have to pay. It's settled then. Jiayu, let's go! Go! "Yue Lai Inn." Boss. What is it, madam? Didn't you say you'll show us the house? I'm busy. We'll go later, alright? Sure. What should we do, mum? Let's go buy something first. Listen up! We're going for dim sum. No spring rolls or the chicken wrapped in lotus leaves. If you keep getting into trouble, then you'll be starved. It's so hot here in the south. Yes, it is! Let's go buy some clothes. Alright. What are you doing? You don't want food? Let's go! Young master, look! Will this do, miss? Please pack this for me. Sure. Miss, buying dim sum? Please don't ignore me. Allow me to treat you to something. I don't know you. You don't? What a pity! Don't feel inferior. Standing in front of you, is the most charming man in this town. Young master Wen, that's me! Don't be duped! You've no idea how many innocent young girls have been duped by him! What is it to you? Don't think that I'll fear you just because you're the nephew of Master He. Mister... Trying to help others in need, that's what a hero should do. I don't care! I am angry, so I must beat you up. Stop, gentlemen! Snowflakes everywhere. Yield? That's hot! Good. Not bad! Jiayu. Why did you fight? Uncle, it's not my fault. I didn't beat him, he beat him. He beat me up for no reason. Shut up! Sorry. How do you teach your nephew? Hurry and apologise to Master Wen. I... Go on! Sorry. I was wrong being a hero just now. Our master is very kind, or else you wouldn't live. No problem! He's way out of my league. Jiayu. So? Master Wen, he's too young. I'm so sorry. Let me treat you to a meal some other time. Let's go! What's the big deal? Master He, you broke all these. What now? Same as last time. Send the bill to my home. Very well. Uncle, let's have some tea. Forget it! Mum. Who is it? The sky was black and the earth yellow; Space and time vast, limitless. Sun high or low, moon full or parsed; With stars and lodges spread in place. Deputy Chief, Brother Zhang Liyi. It's been a while. Your skills have improved, Mrs Chen. Thanks, Deputy Chief. Xiaowei, greet Uncle Zhang. Uncle Zhang. Let's go inside. Sure. Please. You want to kill Luo Yihu for revenge. Uncle Zhang, you can't stop us. That's not what I meant. Or are you scared of Luo Yihu? No, I'm not. I just think there's no point in sacrificing when you aren't confident enough. That won't do any good to all the Qinglian Clan martyrs and neither to the late Chief. I just want to remind you. Xiaowei, Uncle Zhang has a point. Luo Yihu, how much longer do you think you can live? "Spiritual Tablet of beloved husband." Set it up. A bit over... A little bit more, a step back. Good. So? Alright? A bit higher. Okay now? A little bit higher. Great! So fussy! I need to pee! Brother... my pants! Hey! Miss... What do you want? Did you drop this? Hey! You could have at least said a word of thanks. Thank you. This... For you. Thanks. Smells great! You... You change your attitude pretty quickly. Who are you? A local. What are you doing here? I'm here for... It's a misunderstanding, sorry... What's your purpose of being here? I'm here for... Speak up! I'm... Stop running! That's enough, you bitch! I've already apologized. And you wouldn't let it go. I won't yield to you just because you're a woman. Let's see who's the one to yield. Mum, the medicine is ready. It's you! Yes, it's me. Dezhi. Debao, come here. Where have you been? I've been looking for you all day. What for? Dad's looking for you, and he couldn't find you. He's angry! No way! No way? Now that He Guanzhong's school has the signboard done what's happening to ours? He's angry! Debao, where's dad? Dad? He's in the study. Then it's alright. Debao, you've got to remember. If dad asks you tomorrow, tell him I went to sleep early, got it? Sure, I've always been... honest. Sorry? What was that? Dad has always taught us not to lie. What century is this? Don't take your father's word seriously. Shhhhhhh... You know the old man is slow. Let me teach you. There's no need to scare him, I'm here. If he's here, then I... What if I was here? Then I'll keep my mouth shut. Of course you would. Since I'm not talking, it's time for me to sleep. Good night, dad. Wait. What is it, dad? You shouldn't be asking me the question. He Guanzhong's signboard is finished! And what about ours? Not even the frame's done! It's such an embarrassment. Dad, I came home late because I was trying to take care of this. You should know that our martial arts school has always got to outdo Guanzhong's school. We don't even have a signboard, how do we outdo them? I've been waiting for them to finish theirs, then I'll get Uncle Fu to make a bigger one. Longer by six inches, taller by six inches, wider by six inches. In a nutshell, our signboard would be bigger than Guanzhong's. A difference of six inches by each measurement, six times four, twenty four. That's a difference of 2 feet 4 inches. Dad. What's that smell? What's that smell? The smell of Tian Qi. But I haven't used it today. No. How come there's the smell of Tian Qi? How come? Dad, I'm tired after doing all the accounting work. I'm going to sleep. Good night. Are you alright, master? Dad. What happened? All the bandages! I fought with He Jiayu this morning. I strained my back and went to the doctor. Damn it! I'm the most famous doctor in town. Yet you went to someone else? If this gets out, my reputation is at risk! Dad has a point. You're wrong, brother. Why didn't you come to me? I...dad... I know. But I think the other doctor's better. Since your great great grandfather opened our school, then it was handed down to Wu Zizai, then Wu Duojue, then Wu Zhengqi, and to me. Your father, Wu Changjiu, we're a family of doctors. If I'm not better than the others, how do you think you'd be so fat? Dad, why am I so thin then? It's your low ability to absorb nutrients. Did you go to that bozo? No! He Guanzhong is way out of your league. Of course. But it's not him. Who then? That... Tell me. A mother and daughter from the north. What? A woman? Dad, you shouldn't look down upon women. Don't you know that there are career-minded women? Women are all fussy. They do the cooking, washing, ironing and other chores. How good could she be? You can't be so sure. I got well after taking just one dose of her medicine. But in dad's case it takes at least three to heal. Why's that? Please don't speak so poorly of dad, brother. If dad's not a good doctor, why would there be so many loyal patients? True. And if dad doesn't take the treatment slowly, he wouldn't be earning as much, correct? Yes! If not... Nonsense! Doctors have the hearts of a parent. I'd never do such a thing. True, dad treats his patients as if they're his children. Correct! Dad... Say no more! All you know is chasing after skirts! It's time for your punishment. Dad. Stop the nonsense, come on. What now? The teacher is inside. Teacher, you've a guest. Alright, you can be excused now. Luo Yihu arrived in town yesterday. Hurry and inform the man in the Hiring Agency. Tell them to be prepared. Sure, I'll inform him. Chief, I think we should try to initiate an attack before Luo Yihu has made any move. At least better to take a risk than wait to get killed. What should we do? Luo Yihu, our Hiring Agency won't hire someone like you. I guess you would hire those rebels who try to restore the Ming Court? Where's Zhang Liyi? I don't know. Don't know? Bullet proof skill. Are you alright? I can't make it. He escaped! Chase him! Go! Go! Go! Wait... I've thought it over. There's no use competing like this. He Jiayu. How about a challenge to our guts? Meaning? Great uncle died a few days ago, and his body has been moved to the morgue. Yes. Whoever takes the coin out of his mouth before midnight, is the winner. Game? No problem! You... I've never feared anything. Alright! Let's do it! Let's go. Brother, are you sure about this? Don't worry, I'm here. Follow my lead. Come on! "Qi Store" Everything you wanted is here. Are you sure? Or I'd be in trouble. Don't worry. Why so edgy? I can't take any chances with them. So fierce? It's like that when they die unlawfully. Bye. Thanks. "Guang Long Morgue." Brother. What? There are so many coffins here, which one? You're stupid. The rich can afford a private parlour. They won't be in the common room. Right... I'm going to get the money in his mouth. You stay here and guard. Wait for me. Got it. Where's it? "Private parlour." This is it! So nice! "Spiritual Tablet of Wu Yulin" I'm Wu Dezhi. Because I'm in trouble, I'm here tonight to borrow the coin in your mouth. After I'm done, I'll return it. Don't worry about it. Why is he turned upside down? The head must be over there. Forehead. Eyes. Nose. The mouth must be here! You! Rotten corpse! Hey! My brother's been gone for a while. Yes! Let's go inside and look. Sure. He's coming. What now? Hide inside. Alright. Stop. Two lines. Short people won't bump into anything. Tall people beware. Sometimes even the living ones have to bow to the dead. Bow. One, two, three, four, Five, Six. That's correct. The spell is cast! Move, zombies! Stop. Left turn. Into the coffins. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Into the coffins. Stand still! Into the coffin! Into the coffins. Don't run! Into the coffins. Go according to plan. It's creepy! What's to fear? Frankly speaking, there's no such thing as ghosts! Even so. Follow me. What are you doing? Trying to run. Come. They're so real. That's right. Stand in positions. How? This is the end. We can't pretend. Stay and watch. You go ahead. My legs are weak. You're such a fuss! I can't hold it anymore, I need to pee. Go on first, I'm at the back. Stop. Again, get in positions. Stretch, look aside. Choke them! Go on! Choke them to death. Choke them! Nothing. You've high pain tolerance! Amazing! But, having a spell covering the eyes won't help much. Let me tear it off for you! Then they're without spells. Attention! Hands stretched! Face each other. Walk! Go on! I'm fake, he's real! If we stay, we'll die. Hey! Come back! Fatty, you might be able to fool them, but not me. Turn around! Did you try to hit me? Have we met before? You look familiar. Oh, it's Mu Acai from the neighbouring village, he just died recently. Abracadabra! Heaven help me! Let me go! I've studied the classics but not the Buddhist texts. How can I control the zombies? Got it! The Three Word Phrases! When man was first born... Husband wearing the wife's dress. The wife's wearing the husband's pants. The husband didn't zip up. Don't move! Show you what I've got! Alright! Done! Hey! What's wrong? Stay away, amateur! You're trying to take advantage of the dead? Don't do it again. Spell is cast! Into the coffins. Start walking, zombies! Oh it's you! You've really scared me! You too! What's with the outfit? You want to scare me to death? Hey, have you seen my brother? How would I know where he is? Oh no! He ain't still inside, is he? Where? Private parlour. Come on! Brother... Brother... Sorry, brother... Debao. Brother... Come over and take a look. What? Isn't he Teacher Zhang's friend? Let's go tell the teacher, you stay here. Northern Legs Clan. Teacher... Don't ask questions. You must keep quiet about this. Including your father. He... I know what to do. Go home now. Go on! Chain Grabbing! Impressive. The Head of the Spirited Monkeys Clan indeed. Luo Yihu. Today will be your death anniversary. Northern Legs Clan. Mother, what should we do? He's badly injured. It's amazing that he could make it back alive. Xiaowei, I'll write a prescription. You must go and get the medicine right away! Sure! Thanks. It seems I've caught a bit of cold. Could you pick some medicine for me? What? Follow her. Hold this, and go home. Lady, where to? Hey, what do you want? Nothing, I just want to have a chat. Who is sick at home? No one's sick. Out of my way. No one's sick? Then why did you go to the herbal shop? I don't have time to chit chat. Excuse me. Don't go just yet. Give me a kiss. Please behave. Behave? Hey, I'll scream if you won't stop! Scream? Go ahead! I just worry that when you do, they'll come catch you, not me. Come on! Give me a kiss. Come on! You're touching me already? You beat me because you love me, keep going! Calm down, girl! You aren't running anywhere. The Northern Legs' kick? So you're from the Qinglian Clan. It's too late for you to know. Xiaowei, why did you kill him? Who's he? Young master Wen. Master Wen? A local bully... he asked for it. Xiaowei, did anyone see you? No. But his dad will make a scene out of it. I think you should leave for now. Go to Guangxi, and keep a low profile. We've many members there. They will take care of you. Mother. Xiaowei, I think you should listen to Uncle Zhang. Stay away for a while. When Uncle Zhang is recovered, we'll come and look for you. Get packing now! "Xie Ancient Ancestors" Gentlemen. Fellow villagers, a murder took place in Changhe Alley yesterday. The Hiring Agency is actually an anti-Qing fraternity. Luckily we had been informed. And the Court has destroyed them. One more thing... Our young master Wen was murdered for no reason. Today, I ask for your help to investigate this. And yes, at the scene we've found a piece of woman's accessory. I believe our fellow villagers must have seen this before. Officer, our villagers have always been law-abiding. And we've never heard of anti-Qing organization here. You claimed to be law-abiding. What about the Hiring Agency? The Hiring Agency is often frequented by people of different categories. Our villagers take very little notice of it usually. As for their main purpose here, no one knew. Hey, it's me. Out of my way! I'm busy. What? You're off to woo girls again? No, but to save a girl. Save a girl? Could the accessory... Shhhh... Shut up, and follow me. Jiayu, this way. Mrs. Chen, Xiaowei is in trouble! She has... Killed Master Wen! How did you know? Xiaowei told us. Teacher Zhang. What are you doing here? Teacher Zhang, chat with them. I'll go get some medicine. Alright. Just because you work for the court, it doesn't mean you can bully us small-town folks. Kid, looks like you've seen the world, right? Of course! Forget it! What do you know? Good! I'm proud of you, my dear son! This is Master Wu, the local martial arts expert. Master Wu, you're here to uphold justice? You're the best in town? Of course. Everyone knows that! Well said, dad! Like father, like son! Laugh all you want! In a minute, you won't have a father. And you! Won't have a son. I'll show you how it's done! Dad, I'm almost half as good as you! Let me help! Good. Yes! And the younger son of Master Wu was killed by Luo Yihu too. Luo Yihu. Jiayu! Hold it, you guys. Move over! Don't go! Move over! Don't touch me! Let's go! What are you crying for? My dad's dead, of course I'd cry! My uncle's dead too. And so is my younger brother! Who are you two? Who are you referring to? The two in the ancestral temple. Oh! So I missed you two! Well, let's see later on who perishes. Go! Run! I'm Mrs. Chen. Leave now. We won't leave. If you don't leave now, you don't have a chance. Go and inform Teacher Zhang. Hurry! Go back and tell him. Then she... Let's go! Another remaining member of Qinglian Clan. I've been looking for you for a while. Even if you didn't, I'd look for you. Come on in! Teacher Zhang. Only you two are here? Yes. Did you see Mrs. Chen? Yes, luckily she was there. Or else, we would... Where's she now? Say something! Together! Not promising. This is bad. Were you being followed? I guess not. You two, come with me! Thanks. Uncle Zhang, how do you feel? I'll be fine after some rest. Right, Teacher Zhang. We're tired too. Let's go rest soon. Yes... Alright. Uncle Zhang, what are they doing here? They want to learn and so they tag along. Fatty, aren't you worried being scolded by your dad? Dad. You keep crying all day. You think that's gonna bring your dad back to life? You think I want to cry? She brought it up... your mother... Sorry, I didn't know that your father had passed away. Sorry. Fine! And now it's my turn to say sorry. Your mother got killed too. That's true. Uncle Zhang, tell me. Tell me whether she's dead. Is it true? Tell me. Cry... a man may only shed blood but not tears. She isn't crying and you are. Useless! Sorry, Xiaowei. I... As a member of Qinglian Clan, I'm ready to sacrifice. Xiaowei, you're right. We should be more tough at times like this. Teacher, what should we do? The "Qin Na Grab". Hold, grab, strike, defend, follow. Remember the method. Back like a crane, strike like a snake. Body like a bow, hands like arrow. Eyes like meteors, legs like drills. As tough as the iron, as soft as cotton. Be smooth. You, come here. I'll show you. Hand grab. Wrist grab. Arm Lock. Meteor rock. Come here. No! Come here. Very well! Can't move? Who can't move now? Hey! Time to eat. Let's eat. "Grabbing a bowl." "Forward hold." "Interlocking arms." "Yinyang Qin Na." "Interlocking legs." Teacher Zhang, have I improved? Yes, you're almost there. Dexterity. Turn yourself into the Monkey form. Remember it and improvise at heart. Practise hard! Teacher Zhang, We're back. Uncle Zhang. So? Any news? Yes. Bearded Rong has a letter for you. What are you looking at? Keep practising! Follow me! Hey! Focus! Mind your own business. Fat boy! Enjoying your sleep? Time for a trick. Fire! Fire! What? Fire! Teacher... fire! What? Jiayu, what's going on? What are you doing? What? Xiaowei, that's fun! Teacher, he played with this. Put it back, go to sleep. Xiaowei, do you remember what you need to do tomorrow? Teacher, I want to go too! Go where? You will practise tomorrow morning. I'm the only one practising. Jiayu. Where's he? Teacher Zhang, I'd like to take half day off. Jiayu. Zhang Liyi, do you think I can't find you here? Come on! Not even the Buddha could save you today! Hey fatty, do you think the teacher would approve of my outfit? You look like a monkey. I've business to do and you tag along. What's the worry? Look, Uncle Zhang is expecting you. Yes. The teacher is really angry. Won't I worry? All three of us are involved. Come with me. Teacher Zhang. Uncle Zhang. Luo Yihu. I'll send you three to hell today. Be careful! Your Qin Na Hand is quite impressive. It's alright. The Spirited Monkey? It doesn't work anymore. Are you alright? I'm fine. What about you? I'm fine. Go in. C'mon, blow! Let's see if you can! Thanks for that. I'll help you! Once again! Don't let him get away! Fatty, you hit me!
